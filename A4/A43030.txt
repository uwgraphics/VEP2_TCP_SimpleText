ANATOMICAL EXERCITATIONS, Concerning the GENERATION Of Living Creatures: To
which are added Particular Discourses, of Births, and of Conceptions, etc. By
WILLIAM HARVEY, Doctor of Physic, and Professor of Anatomy, and Surgery, in
the COLLEGE of Physicians of LONDON.

LONDON, Printed by James Young, for Octavian Pulleyn, and are to be sold at
his Shop at the Sign of the Rose in St. Paul's Churchyard. 1653.

TO THE Venerable, and highly Accomplished, THE PRESIDENT and FELLOWS of the
COLLEGE of Physicians in LONDON, GEORGE ENT Wishes Health and full Felicity.
ABout Christmas last, while, full weary of anxious, and in the end not much
availing Solicitude, I endeavored to render my mind serene, and free from that
Eclipse; I addressed my self to that Eminent Person, the chiefest Glory and
Ornament of our College, Doctor Harvey, at that time residing not far from the
City: and found Him very intent upon the perscrutation of Natures Works, and
with a Countenance as cheerful, as Mind imperturbed, Democritus like, deeply
searching into the Causes of natural things. I then instantly saluted Him,
with, Are all Affairs well, and right?

How can they, He gravely answered, when the Commonwealth is surrounded with
intestine troubles; and I my self as yet far from land, tossed in that
tempestuous Ocean? And, unfeignedly (added He) if the comfort of my Studies,
and the remembrance of many things, long since fallen under my observation,
were not some refreshment to my Mind; I know not what could prevail upon me,
to desire to survive the present. So it has happened, that this umbratile kind
of life, and vacation from public Cares, which commonly causes a Sadness of
Mind in others, has proved a Sovereign Remedy to mine.

Here I answering, said, Sir, I shall soon afford you the Reason of that happy
Event; which is this: While the greatest number of men flatter themselves with
thoughts of growing wise, by the notions of others Brains, and (without any
addition, unless the deceitful Gloss of different Phrase, and new Method) with
ostentation obtrude upon the World the Traditions of the Ancients; it has been
always your choice, about the secrets of Nature, to consult Nature Her self.
And this kind of Study ever has as less of Fallacy, so more of Delight: in
regard, that frequently, while you are fixed upon the indagation of some one
thing, many others offer themselves to your observation; and such, perhaps, of
which you had no thought to enquire. For, your self (I well remember) was
pleased once to tell me, that you never yet Dissected any Animal (and, indeed,
you have dissected very many) but you found in it somewhat beyond your
expectation, and which you never so much as thought of before.

It Is true, replied He; it has ever been the delight of my Genius, to make
strict Inspection into Animals themselves: And I have constantly been of
opinion, that from thence we might acquire not only the knowledge of those less
considerable Secrets of Nature; but even a certain Adumbration of that Supreme
Essence, the Creator. And, though I was ever ready to acknowledge; that many
things have been discovered by Learned Men of former times: Yet do I still
believe, that the number of those things which remain yet concealed in the
darkness of Impervestigable Nature, is incomparably greater: nay, I cannot
forbear frequently to wonder, and sometimes smile at those, who persuade
themselves, that all things were so consummatly and absolutely delivered by
Aristotle, Galen, or some other great Name, as that nothing was left to the
superaddition of any, that succeeded. Nature, truly, is Her self the most
faithful Interpreter of Her own secrets: and what she exhibits, either more
briefly, or more obscurely, in one kind, the same she explains more largely and
openly, in another. No man doubtless, has ever rightly determined of the Use,
or Office of any Part; who has not in many Animals, beheld, and with himself
diligently considered the Fabric, Situation, annexed Vessels, and other
Accidents thereof. Those Ancient Oracles of Wisdom did terminate the knowledge,
as of all Countries, so also of all Animals, Plants, and other things whatever,
almost with the narrow limits of Greece alone: But, to Us the whole Theater of
the World is now open, and, by the Sedulity of Travelers, we well know, not
only the Place, Habits, and Manners of its Inhabitants; but also, what Animals,
what Vegetables, what Minerals every Region is furnished withal. Nor is there
any Nation so Barbarous, which has not either by chance, or the constraint of
some inevitable necessity, found out something for the common use and benefit
of Mankind, which has escaped the invention of other Nations more Civilized.
And shall we think that nothing of Commodity can accrue to the stock of
Sciences, from these Helps and Advantages: but that all the Fountains of Wisdom
were drawn dry by the First Ages? Certainly, this Fault is to be imputed to our
own defect of Industry; not at all to Nature.

To this, another Evil has adjoined it self; which is, that many, wanting the
Experimental cognition of things, from the formerly conceived verisimilitude of
some Opinion, afterward boldly broach a positive Judgment thereupon, as if it
were certainly known: whereupon it follows, that they are not only grossly
deluded themselves, but seduce others also (who are not sufficiently
circumspect) into Error.

These, and other Discourses of the like importance; flowing from the Doctor,
with admirable readiness, as is customary with Him; I interrupted Him, saying:
Sir, How free you are from all culpability in this kind, all, who know you,
sufficiently understand: and that is the reason, why many Learned and Judicious
Men, who are acquainted with your Unwearied Industry, in the advancement of
Philosophy, greedily expect the Communication of your further Experiments.

And would you then advise me, (smilingly replies the Doctor) to quit the
tranquillity of this Haven, wherein I now calmly spend my days: and again
commit my self to the unfaithful Ocean? You are not ignorant, how great
troubles my Lucubrations, formerly published, have raised. Better it is,
certainly, at some times, to endeavor to grow wise at home in private; then by
the hasty divulgation of such things, to the knowledge whereof you have
attained with vast labor, to stir up Tempests, that may deprive you of your
Leisure and Quiet for the future.

Yea but (answered I) to deserve well, and receive ill, is the usual reward of
Virtue: And the Winds, which raised those your troubles, have, like the Wind
Caecias, drawn mischief upon themselves. With that, He showed me His
Exercitations, touching the Generation of Animals, A work framed, and polished
with very great pains. At sight whereof, I instantly rejoicing, said, I now
have obtained what I earnestly desired: and must tell you, that, unless you
impart these Exercitations to the World, you will both be wanting to your own
Honor, and envy the Utility of others. Nor shall you sustain any further
trouble in the Business; for, whatever of Care is requisite to the oversight of
the Press, I shall willingly take wholly upon my self. To this He condescended
with much ado, at first urging, among many other Disswasive Arguments, that
this His Tractate would be imperfect, without the conjunction of the History of
the Generation of Insects. In a word; at length I prevailed: and He said, Lo,
I resign these my Writings freely into your hands, with absolute power, either
suddenly to publish, or for a while to suppress them, as you shall think
convenient. Having returned Him very many thanks for so high a favor; I took
my leave, and departed as another Jason, enriched with the Golden Fleece. And
when, upon my return home, I had surveyed the Book; I could not but admire that
so vast a Treasure had laien so long concealed: And that, while other men
arrogate so highly to themselves, only for the entertainment of their
nanseating Readers, with Trifles and Toies, and Dishes twice (yea, an hundred
times) brought to the Table before; the Modesty of this Gentleman should be
such, as to set so small a value upon these His Excellent Observations. And
truly, when ever He has been pleased to give any of his own Inventions leave
to see the light, He has not deported Himself with Ostentation, or
superciliousness, after the custom of many, as if an Oak had spoken, or he had
deserved a draught of Hen's-Milk: but, His Dictates were Oraculous, and Merits
above the reach of Elogie, or Reward: but, with exceeding Modesty, as if only
casually, or without any difficulty of inquest, he had fallen upon the
Discovery of those Mysteries, which, indeed, he long searched into with professed
diligence, and study indefatigable.

And this also is an Argument of eminent Candor in Him; that he never inwades
the reputation of any Author, but every where delivers his own judgment, in
mild and friendly language. For, with him it is Proverbial, that That Cause is
worthy to be suspected for scarcely good and profitable, which its Author
contends for with brawling and fierceness: But Truth can want no Patron.

And when it was easy to him, to have woven this whole Web, from materials of
his own; such was his care, for the prevention of Envy, that he yet chose to
follow the clue of Aristotle and Aquapendens, as if he had contributed
thereunto no more then merely the Woofe. Of Him I shall speak no more, lest I
appear to praise to his face a Person, whose Worth has advanced Him infinitely
above my praises; especially to You, to whom his Virtue, Candor, and Ingenie,
are long since very well known. But, of My self, I shall add only thus much;
that in this great Business I have performed no more then the mere office of a
Midwife: producing into the light this noble Issue of His Brain, in all its
parts and line^ments perfect and consummate, as it is now presented to your
View; but staying long in the Birth, and fearing, perhaps, some injurious Blast
of Envy or Detraction. To speak more plainly, I made it my Province to oversee
and correct the Press; and because the Author writes so obscure a Hand (A
thing, as we say, common to learned men (as that scarce any man, but who has
bin accustomed thereto, can read it without difficulty, I used all diligence to
provide against the Errors of the Compositor, that might be occasioned thereby;
which I observed, not to have been duly prevented in the Impression of a small
Treatise of the Doctors, not long since set forth.

And thus, most Learned Sirs, have I rendered you the Reason of this my Writing
to you; which is, to let you know, that our HARVEY has Sacrificed to the
Benefit of the Commonwealth of Learning, to the Dignity of our College, and to
His own Eternal Honor.

Farewell, and Prosper.
To the Incomparable Dr. HARVEY, On his Books Of the MOTION of the HEART and
BLOOD, And of the GENERATION of ANIMALS.
TO Sol, the grateful Persian homage pays;
He Sees by them, and so Adores the rays:
Deeming the Suns just title to arise
To the Tribute, as to the Vision of his Eyes.
And such is thy due claim, Great Light of Art,
Who to the long-dim World do sight impart.
To thy Loud Fame for ever be applied,
As the Conduct, so the Glory of our Guide.
While gray Antiquity Oracular hears,
Not for the Truths she brings, but for the Years,
And her sour Dictats from the Tripod thrown,
Look more to be Obeyed, then to be Known.
Thy daring Art first stands her, and does breed
This Reseue thence, that Science is not Creed.
Who for their Age alone do Writers trust,
Prize Armor, not for the Proof, but for the Rust.
From Books to Nature thy Appeal is made,
Thy Copies by their Archetype are swayd.
Though High and Reverend thy Authors sit,
Yet the Creation is thy Classick Writ.
The various Colonies, whose brood supplies
Inhabitants to Earth, to Seas, and Skies,
These are thy Vatican, and only these
Are thy Infallible Hippocrates;
Thy Sibyll-Volumes, and Thou know them all,
Like their first Godfathen before the Fall.
Their Natures, Kinds, Distinctions and Concent,
The Parts conteinec't, and Parts continent,
Their Order, Substance, Temper, Site, their Force,
Relations, and confederate Intercourse.
Their different Cells which different Bowels bound,
Rooft and partition'd from their Neighbors ground.
The Numerous Intrals Thou have searched through,
Might both Appease the Gods, and Surfeit too.
Not in the dull Emerit Carcass, where
The Shops remain where once the Workmen were;
And only yield this cold Account; there stands
The Stuff and Tools perhaps, but not the Hands.
But in the Living Laboratories, when
The Vitals plied their task like Laboring men;
When Life and Industry one Fountain fed,
And to give over Work, was, to be Dead.
And now the Beasts hold their Instructive life
Innobled by the cunning of thy Knife.
Their Fall hears Sacrifice to the Public good,
Nor is it to be Slain, but Understood.
There thy Observing Eye first found the Art
Of all the Wheels and Clock-work of the Heart:
The mystic causes of its Dark Estate,
What Pullies Close its Cells, and what Dilate.
What secret Engiues tune the Pulse, whose din
By Chimes without, Strikes how things fare within.
There did thou trace the Blood, and first behold
What Dreams mistaken Sages coined of old.
For till thy Pegasus the fountain brake,
The crimson Blood, was but a crimson Lake.
Which first from Thee did Tide and Motion gain,
And Veins became its Channel, not its Chain.
With Drake and Candish hence thy Bays is curld,
Famed Circulator of the Lesser World.
Yet thou no sooner wroughtst this wonder out,
Though proof both against the cool suspense of Doubt,
And rougher Violence of the Despisers tongue,
But Europe round with hot combustions rung:
Its early first Defiance sprung up here,
At last a swarm of Champion Pens appear
From Foreign coasts, and to the conflict come,
Some thy bold Challengers, thy Seconds some.
But when Experience vanquished their defense,
And Prejudice was captive led by Sense:
The Ingenuous laid down Arms, and fled to You,
As their Instructor, and their Victor too.
Thus twice endeer'd, thy Secrets we allow,
By Truths at first, and by Opposers now.
So Gold disputed, and Approved such,
Comes Mettle, but parts Treasure from the Touch.
A Calmer welcome this choice Piece befall,
Which from fresh Extract has deduced all,
And for belief, bids it no longer beg
That Castor once and Pollux were an Egg:
That both the Hen and Houswife are so matched,
That her Son Born, is only her Son Hatched;
That when her Teeming hopes have prosperous bin,
Yet to Conceive, is but to Lay within.
Experiment, and Truth both take thy part:
If thou can escape the Women! there is the Art.
Live Modern Wonder, and be read alone,
Thy Brain has Issue, though thy (...) have none.
Let frail Succession be the Vulgar care;
Great Generation's self is now thy Heir.
M. LL. M. D.

THE PREFACE.
SInce many have requested, and some have importuned me; it will not, I hope,
be unwelcome, (candid Reader) if what I have observed concerning the Generation
of Animals, out of Anatomical dissections (for I have found the whole matter to
be much different, from that which is delivered, either by Philosophers or
Physicians) I expose in these Exercitations, in favor, and for the use of the
Lovers of Truth.

All Physicians, following Galen, teach, that out of the Seed of Male and
Female mingled in Coition, according to the predominant power of this, or that,
the Child resembles either this, or that Parent, and is also either Male or
Female. And sometimes they pronounce the Males Seed to be the Efficient cause,
and the Females the Material; and sometimes again the clean contrary.

But Aristotle (Natures most diligent searcher) affirms that the Male and
Female are the principles of Generation, and that she contributes the matter,
and he the form; and that forthwith after Coition, there is formed in the Womb
out of the Menstruous blood, the Vital principle, and first particle of the
future Foetus, (namely, the Heart, in Creatures that have blood.)

But that these are false, and rash assertions, will soon appear; and will like
clouds instantly vanish, (when the light of Anatomical dissection breaks forth)
nor will they require any elaborate confutation, when the Reader, instructed by
his own eyes, shall discover the contrary by ocular inspection; and shall also
understand, how unsafe, and degenerate a thing it is, to be tutored by other
men's commentaries, without making trial of the things themselves: especially,
since Natures Book is so open, and legible.

I have therefore exhibited to public view, what in these my Exercitations, I
intend to deliver concerning the Generation of Animals; not only that
posterity may thence discern the certain and apparent truth; but also, and that
chiefly too, that (by revealing the Method I use in searching into things) I
might propose to studious men, a new, and (if I mistake not) a surer path to
the attainment of knowledge.

For although it be a more new and difficult way, to find out the nature of
things, by the things themselves; then by reading of Books, to take our
knowledge upon trust from the opinions of Philosophers: yet must it needs be
confessed, that the former is much more open, and less frandulent, especially
in the Secrets relating to Natural Philosophy.

Nor is there any reason, why any man should be deterred by the trouble of it;
if he will but so much as consider with himself, that even life it self is
continued to him, by the never Wearied Agitation of the Heart. Nor truly would
this journey present so much of solitude and desert to us; did not most men by
the custom (or fault rather) of the age we live in, yiedling themselves up to
sluggishnesse, desire rather to err with the many, then with the expense of
their pains and coin, endeavor to be wise with the few: when notwithstanding
the Ancient Philosophers (whose industry also even we extol) went a quite
contrary way to work; and by indefatigable toil searching after several
experiments, have set up a clear light to direct our studies. So that, whatever
notable and approved thing we have in Philosophy, it all is derived unto us by
the pains and industry of ancient Greece. Yet when we content our selves with
their discoveries, and calmly believe (which is mere sleepiness) that there is
now no more place for new inventions, the spritely edge of our own wit
languisheth, and we extinguish the lamp which they lighted to our hands. And
certainly he alone will grant, that the whole truth was engrossed by the
Ancients, (who is ignorant of the many noble discoveries, to pass by other
Arts) lately found out in the business of Anatomy. And this was chiefly done
either by such, who wholly intent upon some one thing, did casually descry some
other: or (which is more commendable) by those, who following Natures conduct
with their own eyes, have at length through a perplexed, but yet a most
faithful tract, attained to the highest pitch of Truth. And in such an
undertaking it is pleasant, not to be tired only, but even to faint away;
where the Irkesomness of Discovering is abundantly recompensed by the discovery
it self. We use, being covetous of Novelty, to wander far into unknown lands,
that our own eyes may witness, what our ears have received at second hand:
where yet for the most part

-- minuit praesentia famam.
Our sight decries report.
Let us then blush, in this so ample, and so wonderful field of nature, (where
performance still exceeds what is promised) to credit other men's traditions
only, and thence coin uncertain problemes, to spin out thorney and captious
questions. Nature her self must be our adviser; the path she chalks must be
our walk: for so while we confer with our own eyes, and take our rise from
meaner things to higher, we shall be at length received into her Closet-secrets.

Of the Manner and Order of attaining knowledge.
THough there be one only road to Science, namely, that by which we proceed
from things more known, to things known less; and from that which is more
manifest, to that which is more obscure; and though Universals are chiefly
known to us (for Science is begot by reasoning from Universals to Particulars)
yet that very comprehension of Universals in the Understanding, springs from
the perception of Singulars in our sense. So that both Aristotle's L. 1. c. 2. 3.
assertions are true, as well that in his Physics; There is a way naturally
laid from those things which are more known and clear to us, to those things
which are more intelligible and clear by nature. For the same things are not
both known to us, and simply so too: wherefore we of necessity must thus
proceed; to wit, from those things which are by nature indeed more obscure, but
yet are more clearer to us; to those things which are more clear and
intelligible by nature. But those things are first perspieuous and manifest to
us, which are most confused. Therefore we must go from Vniversals to
Singulars: for the Whole is more known by sense: now an Universal is a certain
Whole. As that in his Analyticks. Singulars are more known by Post. 2.
us, and do first exist according to sense: for nothing is in the
understanding, which was not before in the sense. And although that
Ratiocination is naturally first and more known, which is made by Syllogism;
yet that is more conspicuous to us, which is made by Induction: and therefore
we define Singulars with more ease, then Universals: for there lies more
Aequivocation in Vniversals. Wherefore we must pass from Singulars to Generals.

That which we have now delivered, hangs very well together, though at first it
seem to clash: because Generals are first collected from Singulars by sense,
and so far only are more known to us, as an Universal is a certain whole and
indistinct thing; and that Whole is more known to us according to sense. For
though in all knowledge, we begin from Sense, because, (as the Philosopher said
before) Sensible particulars are most known to Sense; yet Sensation it self is
an Universal thing. For (if you mind it well) though (while we perceive) that
which is in the outward organ of sense be a Singular, as suppose, a yellow
color, in the sight: yet that which is thence abstracted by the internal
sense, and is judged and apprehended by it, is an Universal. Hence it comes to
pass, that several persons, do at the same instant, abstract diverse species,
and fashion several notions, even of one and the same Object. As it is evident
in Poets, and Painters: who, though at the same time, and in the same place,
all circumstances being alike, they behold one and the same Object, yet each of
them, be they never so many, express and describe it a several way, according
to the several Ideas which they have drawn in their Fancy. So that a Painter
being to draw any one man's picture, though he take a thousand several draughts,
will make them all distinct faces; and them too not only differing from each
other, but from the Archetype it self: yet with so small distinction, that if
you look upon each of them apart, you will think he still brings the same
piece he brought before: and yet set them all together and compare them, and
you will plainly discover a difference. Now the reason of all this is, that in
Uision, or the act of Seeing, each particular by it self was clear and
distinct: which very particular, the Object being removed, (as suppose you
should shut your eyes,) abstracted in the Fancy, or laid up in the Memory, is
presented obscure, and confused: nor is it any longer apprehended as a
particular, but as some General and Universal thing.

This subtilty Seneca does elegantly express, Epist. 58.
according to Plato's opinion. An Idea, says he, is an eternal Exemplar of
Natural things. I will explain this definition, that you may conceive it the
better. Suppose I intend to draw your picture, you your self are the Exemplar
of that picture, from whom my mind takes a representation, which she
indeavoureth to pattern in her work. So then your face, which is my director,
and which I labor to represent, is the Idea. And a little after, he says. In
my discourse even now I made use of a picture-drawer, to illustrate what I was
speaking of. He, when he would paint Virgil, his eye is upon Virgil himself:
Virgils face is his Idea, and the Exemplar of his future design: now that
which the Artist takes from this Idea, and works off, is the Picture. If you
demand the difference between these two, it is this: the one is the Pattern,
the other is the copy taken by the Pattern, and laid upon the work: He
imitates the one, and makes the other. A Statue has a face, but that face is
but the Idos, or representation: But the Exemplar which the Statuary copies
out, has a face, and that face is the Idaea. Do you desire a farther
explication? take it thus. The Idos is that which you see in the piece: the
Idea is quite without the piece, and not only without it, but also had a being
before the piece was at all. For those things that have been formerly observed,
and either by use, or custom have taken deep root in the mind of the
Artificer, do constitute art it self, and the Operative Habit: for Art it
self is nothing but the reason of the work, implanted in the Artists mind. And
the same way by which we gain an Art, by the very same we attain any kind of
science or knowledge whatever: for as Art is a habit whose object is something
to be done; so Science is a habit, whose object is something to be known: and
as the former proceeds from the imitation of Exemplars; so this latter, from
the knowledge of things natural. The Sourse of both is from sense and
experience; since it is impossible that Art should rightly be purchased by the
one, or Science by the other, without a direction from Ideas. Yet in both Art
and Science too, that thing which in sensible objects we perceive, differs
from the perception it self, which is kept in the memory, or imagination. That,
is the exemplar, the Idea, the form informing: this, the Representation, the
Idos, the abstracted Species. That, is a natural thing, a real entity; this, a
resemblance, or similitude, and an ens rationis. That, is employed about some
particular thing, and is it self a singular, and an individual; this, is a
kind of universal and common thing. That, is in every Artist and Philosopher,
a sensible thing, clear, and perfect; this belongs to the mind, and is obscure.
For what we discover by sense, is much more sure and manifest, then what we
discover by the Intellect: because the latter springs from the former, and is
illustrated by it. To conclude, Sensible Objects are of themselves, and before
Intelligible; but Intelligible are after them, and arise from them: nor can we
attain to them at all, without their help.

Wherefore it is, that our judgment erreth about phantasmes and apparitions
comprised in our minds, unless sense give a right verdict, established upon
frequent observations, and infallible experiments. For in every Science, be it
what it will, a diligent observation is requisite, and Sense it self must be
frequently consulted. We must not (I say) rely upon other men's experience, but
on our own; without which, no man is a proper disciple of any part of natural
knowledge; nor a competent judge of what I shall deliver concerning Generation;
for without experimental skill in Anatomy, he will no better apprehend it,
then a man born blind can judge of the nature and difference of colors; or one
born deaf, of Sounds. Therefore (discreet Reader) trust nothing I say, about
the Generation of Animals; I appeal to none but thine eyes. For since every
perfect Science builds upon those Principles, which it finds out by Sense: we
must have a special care, that by customary dissections, we be sure those
Principles are safely grounded. If we do otherwise, we may get a tumid and
floating opinion: but never a solid and infallible knowledge: As it happens
to those, who see foreign countries only in Mapps, and the bowels of men
falsely described in Anatomical tables. And hence it comes about, that in this
rank age, we have many Sophisters, and Bookwrights; but few wise men, and
Philosophers.

And thus much I thought fit to premise as a Taste, that you may understand, by
what helps I my self was assisted, and upon what consideration I was induced to
communicate these my Observations, and Experiments: and that you treading the
same path, may be able not only to be in equitable Umpire between Aristotle,
and Galen, but also forsaking al subtleties; and probable conjectures, and
viewing Nature in her own glass, may search out many other things yet
unrevealed, and perhaps more precious.

Of the former matters, according to Aristotle.
NO kind of knowledge is innate to us, according to Aristotle: For neither
Opinion, nor Art, nor Understanding, nor Speech, nor Reason it self, are in us
by nature, and from our birth; but all these are of the lineage of those things,
which happen to us from without, according to nature As also all those
qualities and habits which are esteemed to be spontaneous, and placed within
our own power; such are Virtues and Vices, for which we receive neither
commendation, and reward, or disgrace, and punishment. The knowledge therefore of
any thing whatsoever must be ou^ proper purchase. But which are the first
principles of this knowledge, is not the scope of this discourse.

Yet I suppose it will not be amiss, t^ premise here, Whence, and How we com^
to know, that we may attain to a mo^^ perfect understanding of the Generation
Animals, and also take away any scruple which any man might raise about
Aristotle opinion. For he affirms, all doctrine, an^ Analyt. post. l. 1. c. 1.
Dianoetical discipline to be framed out of precedent knowledge: Whence it
seems to ensue, that there is either no first knowledge or else that that first
knowledge is bo^^ with us; which is dissonant to what is sai^ before.

This doubt is hereafter cleared by Aristotle Ib. l. 2. cap. ult.
himself; where he teaches the manner how knowledge is acquired. For having
taught, that all certain knowledge is gained by Syllogism, and Demonstration;
and that all demonstrative Syllogismes, are built upon some first, true, and
necessary principles; he at last inquires, how principles become known, and
what is that notifying habit; as also, whether habits are begotten, since they
were not in us before; or else, whether they lurked concealed, in case they
were in us? We have not, says he, those habits; for it happens that they are
hid from those who acquire more exquisite knowledge by demonstration. But if we
receive them, when we had them not before, how should we make it known, and how
should we learn out of a non-preceding knowledge? It is plain therefore that
we have them not, and that they are not in us, and we not know of them; and
that they cannot be begotten in men that have yet no habit at all. Wherefore it
necessarily follows, that we have some power to attain them, and yet not such a
one as is more excellent, and exquisite then they. Now this seems to be a
common thing to all creatures living: to have a connate power of Judging, which
is called Sense.

Now since they have Sense, some of them retain in them the things they
perceive by sense, and some not. They who retain not, have either no knowledge
at all, or else no knowledge of what they do not retain, beyond the bare
sensation it self. Others do retain in their Soul something of what they
perceive. And since there are many such, they are thus differenced; that in
some there does result a certain discourse from the memory of things retained,
and in some not. By Sense therefore memory is made, as we say; and out of a
frequent remembrance of the same thing, is experience made: (for many numerical
Remembrances, are one Experience) but out of Experience, or an Universal
resting in the soul (namely out of one, which is distinct from the many
particulars, and is one and the same in all of them) is raised a Principle of
Art, and Science: of Art, if it relate to Generation; (that is, to doing, or
effecting;) of Science, if it appertain to that which is, (that is, to the
knowledge of an Entity simply;) so that the habits we speak of, are neither
naturally in us, neither are they made out of other habits more known, but they
proceed from Sense.

By which words of Aristotle, it evidently appears, by what Order the knowledge
of any Art, or Science is attained: Namely, by Sense there remains an
impression of the thing perceived: by that impression is made a remembrance of
it, and from multiplied memory, proceeds Experience: from Experience, Universal
Reason, Definitions, Maxims, or common Axioms, which are the most certain
Principles of knowledge. As for example, The same thing, under the same
capacity cannot possibly be, and not be. Every Affirmation, or Negation, is
either true or false; and so forth.

Wherefore, as we said before, no perfect knowledge, which may be called ours,
is in us; but such as is in some sort derived to us from Experience, and Sense;
or is at least examined, and approved by them, and strongly grounded upon some
knowledge pre-existent in us. For without memory, there can be no experience,
which is nothing else but a multiplied memory: neither can memory be, without
a remaining impression of the sensative object, and the object cannot remain,
where it never was.

The great Dictator of Philosophy has Metaph. l. 1. c. 1.
another passage to this purpose. All men naturally desire knowledge. And this
is evidenced, by the love of our Senses: amongst which we prefer the sight;
because this chiefly conveyeth knowledge to us, and distinguishes best of
things.

Now naurally Animals are sensative: but some of them remember not what they
perceive by sense, and some do. And for this cause some are prudent, some are
more capable of discipline then others that remember not. Prudent, without
being taught; as all those that have not the sense of hearing, as Bees, and all
such other kinds of creatures; But all creatures may be taught which have both
memory, and hearing too.

Therefore other creatures have phansies, and memories, but have no title to
experience. But Men have Arts, and Ratiocination. And to them experience comes
by remembrance: for many recordations of the same thing, make one Experience.
Wherefore experience seems much of kin to Art, and Science. For by experience
men gain both Art and Science. For Experience begets Art (as Polus rightly
notes) but Inexperience, Chance.

By which he clearly shows, that no man Apud. Plat. in Gorgia.
can be truly called prudent, or knowing, who does not by his own experience
(attained by manifold remembrance, frequent sensation, and diligent
observation) know things to be so. For without that, we think only, or
believe: and such a knowledge as that, is to be reputed other men's, rather then
our own. Wherefore fond and erroneous is that Method of seeking truth, in use
in our times: while most men diligently inquire, not what the truth is, but
what other men say it is: and inferring Universal conclusions from particular
premises, and thence shaping to themselves irrational deductions, they
transmit to us things like truth, for truth it self.

Hence it is, that Sophisters and halfe-knowing men, polling other men's
inventions, saucily impose them upon us for their own; (shifting only the
phrase and order, and adding some impertinencies of their own) and render
Philosophy (which ought to be clear and perspicuous) obscure, intricate, and
confused. For whosoever they be that read authors, and do not, by the aid of
their own Senses, abstract true representations of the things themselves
(comprehended in the authors expressions) they do not resent true Ideas, but
deceitful Idols, and Phantasms; by which means they frame to themselves
certain shadows and Chimaera's, and all their theory and contemplation (which
they count Science) represents nothing but waking men's dreams, and sick men's
phrensies.

Give me leave therefore to whisper this to thee (friendly Reader) that thou be
sure to weigh all that I deliver in these Exercitations, touching the
Generation of living Creatures, in the steady scale of experiment; and give no
longer credit to it, then thou perceivest it to be securely bottomed, by the
faithful testimony of thy own eyes. This very thing did Aristotle persuade us
to; who when he had discoursed much of Bees, added at last: That the Generation
of Bees is after this manner, appears De genesis an. l. 3. c. 1.
by reason, and by those things which are seen to come to pass after the manner
of Bees. Yet have we not a sufficient discovery of what may fall out. Therefore
when the discovery shall be completed, then is Sense more to be trusted to,
then Reason. For so far only is Reason to be relied upon, as those things
which are demonstrated, agree with those things which are perceived by sense.

Of the Method to be observed in the knowledge of Generation.
SInce therefore in the Generation of Animals (as in all other things of which
we covet to know any thing) every inquisition is to be derived from its Causes,
and chiefly from the Material and Efficient; it seems fit to me, looking back
on perfect animals (namely by what degrees they are begun, and completed) to
retreat, as it were, from the end to the beginning: that so at last when there
is no place for farther retreat, we may be confident we have arrived at the
principles themselves: and then it will appear, out of what first matter, by
what efficient, and what procession the plastic power has its original; and
then also what progress Nature makes in this work. For both the first, and
remoter matter, appears the clearer (being stripped naked as it were) by
Negation; and whatsoever is first made in Generation, that is, as it were, the
material cause of that which succeeds. So, for example, A Man, was first a
Boy (because from a Boy he grew up to be a Man;) before he was a Boy, he was an
Infant; and before an Infant, an Embryo.

Now we must search farther, what he was in his Mothers Womb, before he was
this Embryo, or Foetus; whether three bubbles? or some rude and indigested
lump? or a conception, or coagulation of mixed seed? or whether any thing else?
according to the opinion of writers.

In the same manner, before a Hen or Cock came to perfection, (and that is
called a perfect Animal, that can beget its like) there was a Chicken; before
that Chicken, there is seen in the egg an Embryo, or Foetus; and before that
Embryo, Hieronymus Fabricius Aquapendens has descried the rudiments of the
Head, Eyes, and Spine of the Back. But where he affirms, that the Bones are
made before the Muscles, Heart, Liver, Lungs, and all the Viscera; and that all
the inward parts ought to exist before the outward; he relieth upon
probability, rather then experience; and laying aside the verdict of sense,
which is grounded upon dissections; he flies to petty reasonings borrowed from
mechanics: which is very unbeseeming so famous an Anatomist. For he ought to
have told us what daily changes his own eyes had discovered in the egg, ere
ever the Foetus came to perfection. Especially seeing he professedly wrote the
History of the Generation of the Chicken out of the Egg; and has described in
pictures what progress is made from day to day. It was, I say, befitting so
much diligence, to have acquainted us from the allegation of his own sight,
what things in the egg are made first, what last, and what happen together:
and not to have confined himself to the example of building of Ships, and
Houses, to render a cloudy conjecture and persuasion only, of the order, and
manner of forming the parts.

We therefore (according to the Method proposed) will explain, first in an
Egg, and afterward in other Conceptions of several creatures, what is
constituted first, and what last, in a most miraculous order, and with a most
inimitable prudence and wisdom, by the great God of nature; and at length we
will discover, what we have found out, concerning the first matter out of
which, and the first efficient by which, the foetus is made, as also of the
order and Economy of Generation: that thence we may attain to some infallible
knowledge of each faculty of the formative and vegetative Soul, by the effects
of it; and of the nature of the Soul it self, by the parts, or organs of the
body, and their functions.

Now this indeed we could not perform in all kind of Animals; because some of
them cannot be gotten; and others again are so exceeding small, that our eyes
can hardly discern them.

Let it suffice therefore that we have done it in some creatures, which are
more known to us; to whose platform, the first originals of all other creatures
may be reduced. We have made choice therefore of such, as might render the
credit of our experiments less questionable, namely larger, and perfecter
creatures, and such as are within our own power. For in the larger creatures,
all things are more conspicuous; in the perfecter, more distinct; and in those
that are in our own power, and conversant amongst us, more obvious: so that we
have liberty (at pleasure) by searching into them, to rescue our observations
from wavering hesitation. And of this sort, in the race of Oviparous creatures,
are Hens, Geese, Pigeons, Ducks Eishes, Shel-fish of both kinds (as Lobsters,
Oysters, etc.) Fishes that have no shells at all, Frogs, Serpents: also
Infects, as Bees, Waspes, Butterflies, Silkworms. And of Viviparous, Sheep,
Goats, Dogs, Cats, all Cattle that divide the Hoof; and in chief, the
perfectest of all creatures, Man himself.

Having thorough insight and knowledge of these things, we may then contemplate
the abstruse nature of the Vegetative Soul; and discern in all creatures what
ever, the manner, order, and causes of their Generation: because all other
creatures agree either generically, or specifically with the forecited, or at
the least with some of them; and are procreated after the same manner of
generation, or else in a manner proportioned to it. For Nature being divine,
and perfect, is always consonant to her self in the same things. And as her
works do either agree or differ (namely in kind, species, or some analogy) so
her operation (that is to say, generation or Fabric) is the same or different
in them. Whoever enters this new, and unfrequented path, and inquires for
truth in the vast volume of Nature, by Anatomical dissections, and experiments,
he meets with such a crowd of observations, and those too in such exotic
shapes, that to unfould to others the mysteries himself has discovered, will
be more toil, then the finding of them out: for many things occurr which have
yet no name; such is the plenty of things, and the dearth of words. So that if
a man should cloth them in Metaphors, and express his new inventions by old
words, and such as are in use: the Reader could no more understand them, then
canting: and would never be able to comprehend the business, since he never saw
it.

And then again to mint up new and fictitious terms, would rather cast a mist,
then enlighten. For so he must needs express things unknown, by that which is
less known: and the Reader would be more afflicted to unriddle the words, then
to understand the matter. And therefore Aristotle by unexperimented persons is
thought obscure: And this perhaps was the reason, why Fabricius ab Aquapendente
chose rather to describe the Fabric of the Chicken in the Egg by tables then
words.

Therefore be not offended, Courteous Reader, if in setting out the History of
an Egg, and in the description of the Generation of the Chicken, I make use of
a new method, and sometimes of unusual terms; nor think me hereby more desirous
of vainglory, then of advantaging others by true experiments, and such as are
grounded in Natures self. To take off that prejudice, know, I tread but the
steps of other men who have lighted me the way, and (so far as is fit) I make
use of their notions. But in chief, of all the Ancients, I follow Aristotle;
and of the later Writers, Hieronymus Fabricius ab Aquapendente, Him as my
General, and This as my Guide. For as they which find out new Plantations, and
new Shores, call them by names of their own coining, which Posterity afterward
accepts and receives; so those that find out new Secrets, have good title to
their compellation. And here, me thinks, I hear Galen advising; If we consent
in the things; contend not about the words:

OF GENERATION.
The Reason why we begin with a Henns Egg.
EXERCITATION I.
HIeronymus Fabricius Aquapendens (whom, as I said before, I have chosen for my
guide) in the beginning of his Book concerning the formation of the Egg and
Chicken, has these words: My purpose is to treat of all sorts of formation of
the foetus, taking my rise from that which proceeds from an egg; For this
ought to precede all other discourses of this nature, in that it not only be
friends us with a more easy discovery of Aristotle's thoughts concerning this
matter, but because the Treatise of framing the foetus out of an egg is much
the fullest, and exceeds the other both in extent, and difficulty.

But we begin our discourse from the history of an Egg, both for the reasons
by him recited, and likewise, because we may thence borrow more infallible
grounds, which (in regard they are more known to us) may enlighten us to
contemplate the Generation of any other Animals. For since Eggs are a cheap
merchandise, and are at hand at all times, and in all places; it is an easy
matter to observe out of them, which are the first evident, and distinct
ground-works of Generation; what progress nature makes in formation, and with
what wonderful providence she governes the whole work.

Fabricius goes on: That the contemplation of framing the foetus out of Eggs
is the largest of all, appears in this, that the greatest part of animals are
begotten of eggs. For to pass by almost the whole race of Insects, and
imperfect Creatures, which sense it self discovers to spring from eggs; even
the most part of perfect productions are of that extraction. Hither he
refers, All sorts of Birds; and of Fishes too; (bating only Whales) also
Crusted-fish, Shellfish, and Fishes without scales,; and amongst Terrestrials,
all Creeping things, Creatures that have numerous feet, and also all kinds of
Serpents; and amongst four-footed Beasts, all sorts of Lizards.

But we pronounce (as shall appear hereafter) all animals whatever, even
Viviparous also, nay man himself to be made of an Egg: and that the first
conceptions of all living creatures which bring forth young, are certain Eggs,
just as the first conceptions of all Plants are certain seeds. And therefore
Empedocles rightly styled the seeds of Plants, a sort of Eggs. The history
therefore of Eggs is most spacious, because it yields an insight into all
kind of generation.

Wherefore of an Egg, we shall first show, where, whence, and how it is made.
And then, by what means, order, and degrees, the foetus or chicken is
fashioned, and perfected in the Egg, and of it.

Here again Fabricius: The productions of Animals do some of them spring out of
Eggs, some out of Seed, and some out of Putrefaction; and hence it is, that
some are called oviparous, some viviparous, others the issues of putrefaction,
or creatures born of their own accord; by the Greeks, (...).

But I dislike this division; because all Animals may in some sort be said to
be born out of Eggs, and in some sort out of Seed: besides, they are styled
Oviparous, Viviparous, or Vermiparous, rather from the issues themselves bring
forth, then from the original matter of which themselves were made; namely,
because they produce an Egg, a Worm, or a living Creature. Some of them are
also said to be sponte nascentia, creatures born of their own accord, not
because they quicken out of putrid matter, but because they are begotten by
chance, by natures own accord, and by an aequivocal generation, (as they call
it) and by parents of a different species from themselves. For other Animals
also do bring forth an Egg, or a Worm, as their Conception, and Seed; out of
which, after they have exposed it to the wide world, they produce a foetus, and
so are named Oviparous, or Vermiparous. But now the Viviparous are therefore so
called, because they retain and cherish their conception, or seed, so long
within their own bowels, till the foetus come forth shaped, and alive.

Of the place of Generation.
EXERCITATION II.
NAture (says Fabricius) was first solicitous of the place, which she at
length decreed to be either within the Animal, or without it; and appointed the
womb to be the place, within the creature; but without, the egg: in the womb,
nature generates of seed and blood; but, in the egg, of such parts as the egg
is made of.

For whatsoever is begotten of seed properly so called, is begun, and
perfected, either in the same place, or in a diverse. All Viviparous creatures
have both their original and perfection in the womb it self; but all Oviparous,
as they have their foundation within their parent, and there become an egg; so
are they completed into a foetus, when they are divided from their parent.
And, in the Catalogue of these, some creatures continue their eggs so long
within themselves, till those eggs be ripe, and accomplished: and thus do
Birds and Beasts too, as many as bring forth eggs; and serpents likewise. But
others again expose their seed whiles it is yet unperfect and immature, to
acquire its growth, perfection, and ripeness from abroad: and thus do many
sorts of Fishes, Froggs; also Fishes without scales, and both sorts of
Shellfish, and Snails, whose eggs, when first excluded, are but designs or
beginnings, being yolks only, which do afterward invest themselves with
whites, and by degrees attracting, concocting, and affixing aliment to
themselves, become perfect seed, and a complete egg And of this kind also is
the seed of Insects (which Aristotle says is a Worm) which being exposed
incomplete at the first, seek their own food, and so thrive, and enlarge, from
an imperfect egg, to a perfect egg, and seed. But the Hen, and all other
Oviparous creatures, do lay a perfect egg; of which, from without the womb,
they hatch a foetus. And for this cause Aquapendens mentions two places
assigned to generation; one Internal, namely the womb; the other external,
which he calls the Egg. But (in my opinion) he might, upon better grounds,
have called the Nest, or Repository, the external place; because in that the
exposed seed is cherished, ripened, and hatched into a foetus. For the
Generation of Oviparous creatures, is mainly differenced by their Nest. Nor is
it less then admirable, that such little creatures should make choice of these
receptacles with such exquisite prudence; and shape, build, guard, and conceal
them, with such unimitable art and contrivance: whence we must needs conclude
(with the Poet treating of Bees) that they are endowed with a portion of divine
inspiration: and that we may easier admire their uninstructed art and prudence,
then attain unto it.

Of the Ovary, or upper part of the Henns womb.
EXERCITATION III.
THe womb of the Henn is divided by Fabricius, into the Upper, and the Lower;
the Upper he names the Ovary.

The seat of the Ovary is next under the Liver at the spine of the back, above
the descending trunk of the great Artery. For just in that place where in
bigger sangineous creatures, the Coeliacal artery goes into the Mesentery,
namely, at the original of the Emulgent veins, or a little lower; and in that
place where the preparing seed vessels which go down to the Testicles have
their rise, in all other sanguineous and viviparous creatures; and where also
the cock wears his Testicles, there is the Hens Ovary found. For some Animals
have their stones hanging out, others conceal them about the Loins within; in a
middle space as it were, at the beginning of the preparing vessels. But the
Cock has his stones immediately adjoined to the vasa praeparantia, as if his
seed wanted no preparation. Aristotle indeed says, that the Egg is begun at
the midriffe; but we, says Fabricius, in our treatise of Respiration, deny
that Birds have any midriffe at all. Which difficulty is thus resolved: Birds
are not quite destitute of a midriff; because they have a thin membrane
instead of the midriff; which Arist. calls cinctum, or septum: but they have no
musculous midriffe, as other Animals have, neither is it used by them for
Respiration. But, to say truth, Aristotle acknowledged no muscles at all.

Thus, in one and the same breath he accuses the Philosopher, and excuses him
too: yet he himself is in an Error the while. For it is certain, that
Aristotle did acknowledge muscles (as we have elsewhere observed, and
demonstrated) and also that membranes in Birds (which are not only placed
transversly to gird the body, but are also extended according to the longitude
of the belly) do supply the place of the diaphragma, or midriff, and do conduce
to respiration: as in another place in our Exercitations, concerning the
Respiration of animals, we have clearly proved. And, to say no more at present,
Birds do not only respire with much more facility then other creatures, but in
their songs do tune and accent their voices with manifold variety: yet,
notwithstanding all this, their Lungs are so knit to their ribs and sides,
that they can be but very little dilated, raised up, or contracted. Besides all
this, (though no man to my remembrance has ever observed so much before) their
Bronchia, or extremities of the rough Artery are hollow as far as the very
abdomen, and they treasure up the inspired air in the cavities of their
membranes. Even as Fishes, and Serpents draw the air into large bladders,
which are seated in their abdomen or belly, and so reserve it, and by that
means are conceived to swim the better: and as froggs, and toads, in the Summer
time when they breathe most, do imbibe much more air then at other times into
their numerous vesicles, (which occasions their wondrous swelling) that so they
may afford more liberal exspirations in their croaking: So in Birds, the Lungs
seem rather a thorough-fare, and a passage for breathing, then the adaequat
organ of it. Which had Fabricius observed, he would not then have denied, but
that those membranes (at lest with the assistance of the muscles of the belly)
do serve for respiration, and execute the office of a diaphragma: since even
that is not a respiratory organ, without the help of the muscles of the belly;
though it have also another employment in those creatures in whom it is
musculous, and fleshy; Namely, to depress the stomach enlarged with meats, and
the guts distended with wind and excrements; lest the heart and lungs should
be straightened by their intrusion, and the closet of life it self invaded. Now,
since there is no fear of any such mischance in Birds, their midriffe is
membranous, and exceeding advantageous to the work of respiration; and for this
cause they are said to have a diaphragma. Moreover, were birds quite destitute
of a diaphragma, yet Aristotle were not to be blamed, for saying, That Eggs
receive their first rudiment at the septum transversum; for by this name he
only points at the place where the diaphragma is commonly found in other
Animals. So we also say, that the Ovary is situate at the beginning of the
preparing spermatical vessels, though a Hen has no such vessels at all.

The Perforation of the Lungs, by me first discovered (of which I made mention
but now) is in no sort dark and obscure; but, in Birds especially, very patent:
so that in an Ostrich I found many perforations, into which I could easily
thrust the top of my finger. In a Turkey, nay in an ordinary dunghill Cock,
and almost all Birds whatsoever, a probe being put into the winde-pipe, will
find an open and wide passage, clean through the lungs into the cavities of
the abdomen, or lower belly. Blow the air into their lungs with a pair of
bellows, and you shall find it hasten into the lower parts, and that not
without a sensible force.

Nay, we may very well question whether, even in man whilst he is living, the
air does not penetrate into the cavity of the chest, by the aforesaid passages.
For could otherwise the putrefied matter of impostumated, and the blood shut
out of the veins of pleuritical persons, flow from thence? How could the air,
when the breast is wounded (though the lungs be untoucht) rush out of the
wound? or how could injections cast into the cavity of the chest, be returned
again with the spittle? But of this at large in our Exercitations, of the
Causes, Instruments, and Use of Respiration.

I return now to the Ovary, and the upper part of the womb of the Hen; in
which the first rudiments of the Eggs are conceived, which are (according to
Aristotle) small at first, and white; but increasing, afterward become of a
pale yellow.

As for this upper womb mentioned by Fabricius, the truth is, there is no such
thing at all, till the Hen have conceived, and has the principles of Eggs
within her, which may then be properly called a cluster of wheals. And
therefore he says very rightly: The superior matrix is nothing else but
almost an infinite crowd of yolks, which are amassed in one heap together,
being of a round figure, and of diverse magnitude; amongst which there is a
like difference from the greatest to the least, as between a grane of
mustard seed and a walnut, or a medlar. This multitude of yolks are united and
knit together as it were upon a bunch: and therefore I call it a Vitellary, or
a bunch of yolks, because it much resembles a bunch of grapes. As Aristotle
also said of fishes that want scales, where he writes, That their eggs are laid
as if they were glewed together like grapes; for as in a bunch of grapes, the
berries are some biggest, some less, and some least of all, and each is tied to
its proper sprig, so is it in the Vitellary.

But now in Fishes, Frogs, hard or crusted Shellfish, and Snails, the matter is
much otherwise; for they contain in them Eggs of the self-same magnitude; which
being discharged, do grow alike, are perfected alike, and at the same time
produce young ones. But in the Ovary of a Hen, and almost of all other
Oviparous creatures, there is a distinct increase of the yolks, from almost an
invisible smalness, till they arrive to a complete magnitude: though the Eggs
of Hens (not unlike the eggs of those creatures which conceive and lay their
eggs together) are hatched into chickens in the same nest, almost at the same
time. Yet in Pigeons (which lay, and hatch only two eggs at a time) I have
observed all the Eggs in the Ovary to be of a like magnitude, excepting only
those two which were greater then the rest, and were now ready to descend into
the second uterus, or womb; so that of them there is great increase, not by the
multitude of their young at once, but by the frequency of their repeated
births, which happen every month. So in cartilaginous Fishes; as the
Thorn-back, the Fork-fish, the Dog-fish, etc. two eggs are only ripe at a time,
and falling down on both sides from the right and left horn, they are cherished
in the lower womb, and exclude their young alive (as the Viviparous creatures
do:) yet in their Ovary they have almost an infinite number of eggs, and of
different dimensions; in the Thornback I have numbered above a hundred.

But the Eggs of other oviparous creatures are either perfected when they are
out of the womb, as the eggs of fishes; or at least concocted, as the eggs of
snailes, of hard shellfish, and of spiders. The snailes they treasure up their
eggs in froth; crusted shellfish, (as shrimps, cray-fish, lobsters) carry them
about fastened to their finnes; but the spider bears them about with her, as
it were in a basket wrought of her web, and so cherishes them. The Beetle
wrappeth her eggs in dung, (rolling them in it with her hinder legs) and so
lays them up: and, in all these, there are an incredible number of eggs.
Fishes have two oblong bladders, or bags, as you may see in the Carp, the
Herring, and the Smelt; in all which, as there is no womb at all discernable,
besides the Ovary, so is this Ovary sometimes so thronged with eggs, that it
far exceeds the bulk of the whole body besides.

Of the Ovaries of these Carps and Mullets, amassed together, and salted, and
hardened in the smoke, is made that kind of meat so much in request with the
Greeks and Italians (called by these Botarcha, by the Greeks (...), that is to
say, pickled eggs) such as is that which is found in our red Herrings, and the
red and compacted seed within a Lobster. That meat which is made of the salted
eggs of Sturgem, is called Caviare, which resembles black soap, and is the
delight of gluttons.

In all fishes (which have a numerous offspring) so great abundance of eggs is
generated, that the whole capacity of the belly can hardly contein them, when
they are newly conceived, much less when they are of any growth. And therefore
in fishes, saving their Ovary, there is no other part dedicated to generation.
For their eggs take growth abroad; nor need they any womb for that office. And
this Ovary seems to carry some Analogy to the resticles, or little seminal
bladders, not only because they are found in that place where the stones are
bred in males; (for the stones in Cocks are situate, as we have said, at the
ingress of the Coeliacal artery, near the midriff, and there the Hens Ovary is
found) but also, because in both sexes of fishes, at the time of generation,
there are two little bags passing through the whole belly, alike in site,
figure, and magnitude; which increasing at the same time, are filled, in males
with a similary, spermatical, and milky substance, (whence it is called fishes
milk) and in the females, with little invisible grains or sands; so that in
the beginning of conception (by reason of their close fabric) they look like a
similar body, and like the males milk regularly coagulated, and may afterward
be discerned like the smallest sands clinging together in their proper bags.

In lesser Birds (which bring forth eggs, and those few ones, but once a year)
you will scarce find any Ovary at all; but just where the stones hang in
males, there in females, instead of an Ovary, are found three or four bubbles
(according to the number of eggs, whose foundation they are) as discernable as
the testicles of the males.

In the horns of the Serpents womb (which are like the spermatical vessels of
the males) appear the first rudiments of the eggs, like little balls fastened on
a string, as is usual in women's bracelets, or chaplets of beads made of amber.

They therefore that are found in the Vitellary, or Ovary, are not to be
counted perfect eggs, but the first ground-works or rudiments of eggs, which
are in such order and magnitude disposed in the bunch, that one may daily
succeed the other, to supply the hens laying. But no egg in the Ovary is
clothed with a white, for only yolks are found there; which, as they gain
growth, get without the small ones; that being arrived to a larger room, they
may the better thrive and enlarge. And therefore that of Fabricius is very
true, where he says, The greater yolks of the bunch are in the surface, page 3.
the lesser are in the middle, encompassed as it were by the greater; lastly,
the least of all lie undermost. For as they get greater bulk by growing, they
are separated from their fellows; which, while it is doing, every yolke,
besides his proper coat, borrows another from the Ovary, which encompasseth
it without, and tyeth it to the foundation from whence it sprung: wherefore by
Fabricius it is called pediolus, sive pedunculus, the stalk, because by its
means, as the fruit draws nourishment and increase from the tree, so does the
yolk from the cluster. For this stalk is a membranous hollow fastening, which is
extended from the bottom of the cluster to the yolk: which so soon as it
arrives at, it is dilated, and (just as the optic nerve is spread in the eye)
covers the yolk with an outward coat. Hence Aristotle probably called it
(...), that is, the little umbilical appendix, or pipe. This little stalk
conveighs De Genesis An. l. 3. c. 2.
with it many vessels into the yolke, through which they are many ways
divaricated.

These things are indeed truly delivered by Fabricius, but he mistaketh, when
he says, This coat does not environ the whole yolke, but only a little more
then half of it, just as the cover of an acorn, called the cup: whence it
comes to pass, that the outward part of the yolke, being deserted by the
forementioned membrane, is exposed to the view without veins, and appears
naked. For it embraces all the yolk; but in the outward part of the yolk, it
is not easily discerned from its own coat, because they both are very thin.
But, in the forepart, where the yolk respects the foundation of the cluster,
this coat adhereth not to the yolk, neither does it send any veins into it,
but only begirts it like a bag.

Every yolk assumeth a particular coat from the same foundation; and therefore
this place is not to be reputed the common womb, since nothing is here to be
found, beside the cluster, or heap of many eggs, of different magnitude,
arising from the same foundation.

Now this Foundation is a particular body of it self, arising at the spine of
the Foul, annexed to the great Artery and Vein, being loose, porous, and
fungous, that so it may produce diverse yolks out of it self, and afford each of
them their coats; which coats do afterward stretch, as the yolks enlarge, and
enclose them like a Bag, with a narrow neck, but a large belly, in like manner
as glass-vials are fashioned by the breath of the Glass-maker. Fabricius says
further; The yolks, as they spring from a very small original, being about the
magnitude of the seed of Millet, or Mustard, so they are very little, and white,
as Aristotle observes, and do also increase by degrees; and, as the same
Aristotle says, grow like yolks, and yellow, till they attain the just
magnitude which every body knows them to be of. But I have observed them to
be much less then the seeds of Millet, even as slender as the smallest wheals,
or spots, or sands, (such as I have told you are found in the Ovaries of
Fishes) scarce to be discovered by the eye it self, as if they were only the
ruggedness of the membranes of that part from whence they proceed.

Of the Infundibulum, or Tunnel.
EXERCIT. IV.
THe next part of the Womb of the Hen, is by Fabricius called the Infundibulum:
for it is like a Tunnel, or Trumpet, tending down-ward from the Ovdry, (which
it every where encompasseth) and growing wider by degrees, is terminated in the
superior production of the Womb.

This Infundibulum does afford a passage to the yolks (when their stalks are
broken off) into the second womb (as Fabricius thinks) and resembles the
Tunicae vaginalis, or coat of the Testicles in the Cod, consisting of an
exceeding thin membrane, and easy to be dilated, that so it may entertain the
yolks which daily roll thither, and conveigh them into the aforesaid Uterus.

Do you desire an Illustration of this matter? fashion in your mind a very
slender plant, whose knobby roots may represent the cluster of yolks, and its
trunk the little vaginal, or sheath-like pipe: as the stalks of that herb do in
the winter dye, and vanish away; so, in like manner, when the Hen cease to
lay any more eggs, the entire Ovary, together with the Infundibulum, are
retired, and abolished, and (like useless things) quite dried up; leaving only
the fundamentum remaining, and some tracks and footsteps of their roots.

That this Infundibulum does only supply the office of a thorow-fare, is hence
enough evinced, in that the yolke is never found residing in it: but as the
Testicles sometimes do through the Tunica vaginalis creep upwards into the
Groin, and as those Testicles are in some creatures (as the Hare and Mole)
hidden within the Abdomen, and do from thence again return and descend; so by
the Infundibulum do the yolks slide down from the Ovary into the Uterus; and
it supplieth the place of that Tunnel (as it also has its form and shape)
through which liquors are transmitted, from one vessel into an other of a
narrower neck.

Of the Exterior part of the Uterus of the Hen.
EXERCIT. V.
FAbricius prosecuteth the description of the Uterus, after the Ovary, and so
by a perverse method, premitteth the treatise of the superior part, and
production of the womb, to that of the very womb it self. And is also too
precise and conclusive in assigning three circles to it, and in determining
their certain scituations, when indeed themselves are uncertain. And there also
he does preposterously repeat the definition of the Infundibulum.

Give me leave therefore to propose here my Observation, and history of the
Uterus of the Hen, (which I apprehend to be more commodious, according to
Anatomical method) and to proceed from the outward parts to the inward,
(contrary to the course of Fabricius.)

In a Hen that is plucked, you may perceive the Fundament, not (as in other
creatures) gathered up into a ring, but having a depressed orifice divided
transversly, shrunk up as it were into two lips, the superior of which
gathers the inferior into it, and so covers and concealeth it. That
uppermost lip, or covering, arises from the root of the rump; and, as the
upper eyelid covers the eye, so does this the three orifices of the Privity,
(namely that of the Fundament, of the Uterus, and of the Ureters) which lie
retracted under this covering, as under a praepuce, or foreskin: as in the Lap
of a Woman, the passage into the womb and bladder is veiled by the labra of the
privity, and the parts called Nymphae; so that, without dissection, or at lest
some forcible retraction of that covering, neither the passage of the
Excrements out of the guts, nor of the Urine out of the Ureters, nor of the Egg
out of the Uterus, can appear in a Hen. And therefore those two excrements
(namely the Urine, and the Dung) are rejected both together, as out of a
receptacle common to them both, by lifting up of that covering, and so
disclosing the perforation: and so likewise in coition, the Hen unvaileth her
lap, and accommodateth it for the Cock that treads her: as Fabricius observed
in a Turkey-Hen, which courted a Cock. I have seen an Ostrich-Hen (when her
Keeper gently stroked her back, with design to inflame her) grovelling on the
ground, lift aside that veil, and expose and stretch out her lap; which the
Cock perceiving, being instantly cupidstruck, proceeded to tread her; and
having one leg on the ground, and the other on her back, with an exceeding
large Yard (of the dimensions almost of a Neats-tongue) pursued his attempt:
great was the noise and clamours on both sides, and their necks often extended
and retracted, and many other expressions of content. Nor is this proper to
Birds only, but common also to other Creatures, which by removing aside their
Tail, and extending their Lap, prepare themselves to receive the Male. So that
the Tail in other creatures seems to be almost of the same use, with the Vail
in the Hen, which, unless it be removed, or lifted up, there is neither passage
for the excrements, nor the addresses of the Male.

In Hinds and Does (as if they were more severely chaste then other beasts) such
a skreen of modesty, and skinney covering, shrowdeth both the lap, and passage
of urine, which must of necessity be lifted up, ere they can have conversation
with the Male. In Beasts also that have tails, there must be an elevation of
them, before they can bring forth their young. And Midwives also, by unction
and retrusion of the extremity of the os sacrum, do facilitate women's labors.

A certain Surgeon of my acquaintance, an honest man, being returned from
the East Indies, told me upon his credit, that in the Island called Bornea, in
the Inland and Hilly parts of it, there are a race of men born with Tails, (as
Pausanias writes of another place) and that he saw a Virgin of that flock, whom
they had much ado to catch, (for they are wild) who had a fleshy, thick tail,
a span long, reflected between her legs, to conceal her modesty: such care
has nature to hide those parts.

The fabric of this Covering in a Hen, is like to that of the upper lid of the
eye, composed of skin, and of a fleshy and musculous membrane, with fibers
every where drawn from the circumference to the Center; and its inward
superficies, like that of the eyelid, and foreskin, is soft. It has also in
its extremity a semicircular small gristle, like the Tarsus of the eyelid:
and, beside that, between the skin, and fleshy membrane, a cartilaginous
interstitium, from the root of the rump joined in a right angle to the
semicircular Tarsus, or gristle: (as Batts have a kind of little tail,
concealed under their membranous wings) by reason of which composition, this
covering does, as it were with a tail, shelter and hide the perforations of
the privities. The Perforations in the Fundament of a hen.


Wherefore, no sooner is this protection cut away, but certain perforations
appear, whereof some are more apparent, others more obscure. The more visible,
are that of the fundament, and the lap; namely, the passage of the excrements,
and the entrance into the womb: the obscurer are, as well that through which
the urine flows from the kidneys, as also that smaller one found out by
Fabricius, into which (says he) the Cock does immit his seed; which cavity
notwithstanding Antonius Ulmus a diligent dissector in Aldrovandus did not own,
nor any one else besides Fabricius, so far as I The Sink.
know. These Holes are all so near neighbors the one to the other, that they
seem all to consent and pass into one and the same cavity; which (because it
lies in common both to the excrement and the urine) may be called the Sink;
because, in it, the excrements of the guts, together with the urine descending
from the reins, are mixed together, till they be together excluded. And
through this the egg also passing forth, works its way.

The making of this cavity is such, as if both the excrements descended into
the Bladder, and nature did abuse the urine into a natural clyster. And
therefore it is something thicker and ruggeder then the gut, and also in
ejection and coition, thrusts it self out, (the covering, as I have said, being
removed) and hangs out like the inside of the gut: and at that time all the
holes appear distinctly; which presently again upon its retraction, being
collected as it were into a purse, are hidden out of sight.

The more conspicuous Holes, (namely that of The situation of the orifice of
the womb.
the fundament, and the lap) obtain a contrary situation in all fowls, from
all other creatures; for in these, the Pudendum, or female genital, is seated
foremost, between the right gut and the bladder: but in those, the passage of
the Excrement is placed foremost, and between that passage and the rump, the
passage into the matrix.

But that Hole into which Fabricius thinks the The Perforation of the Purse,
so called by Aquapendens.
Cock does cast his seed, is discovered between this door of the matrix, and
the rump. But, for my part, I acknowledge no such employment of it; for, in
Pullets or young Hens, it is hardly found at all; but in grown foul it is
promiscuously as well in the Cock as in the Hen. And, besides that, this hole
is very small and obscure, and cannot therefore be imagined to be of so
concerning an office; for it scarce admits the point of a small needle or a
slender hair, and terminateth also in a blind and obscure cavity: nor could I
ever perceive any seminal humor at all in it; though Fabricius affirms, that
the semen is there reserved as in a purse, for a whole year together, and that
in the interim all the eggs receive fecundity from thence, as shall be
discoursed hereafter.

All Birds, Serpents, Four-footed beasts, which are Oviparous, and Fishes also,
(as is evident in Carps) The passage of Urine in a Hen.
are endowed with Kidneys and Ureters, through which the Urine flows: which
Aristotle, and other Philosophers hitherto knew not. But Birds, and Serpents,
whose Lungs are fungous, have but very little urine; because they drink but
little, and that by sips; and therefore they need no Bladder of Urine, but do
deposit it (as we have said) into the common sink and receptacle with the dryer
excrements. But in Carps, and some other fishes I have found a Bladder of Urine.

In a Hen, the Ureters descend form the Kidneys on both sides, (which Kidneys
are large and ample and seated in the cavity or hollow of the back and do end
in the cavity or common sink. But their Outlet is so obscure, and concealed in
the very entrance of the cavity, that to discover it from without, or to search
it with the most slender probe, is altogether impossible. Nor is it indeed any
great wonder; for in all creatures, even in the greatest of all, the insertion
of the Ureters near the neck of the Bladder, is dark and winding, that (though
urine, nay and stones too do sometimes glide through them into the bladder) not
so much as the air it self can go back that way, nor the urine, be it never
so much forced.

All these things are clear in an Ostrich; in which I have found, beside the
outward orifice of the common cavity, which was veiled by the Covering; another
orifice within the Fundament, which was round and gathered up, and shut as it
were with a sphincter muscle. But to pass these, and return to our purpose.

The Orifice of the Womb, or Lap; namely the passage out of the publik cavity
into the womb of The Orifice of the Uterus.
the Hen, is as it were a certain soft protuberance or rising, loose, wrinkled,
and orbicular; just like the end of the Foreskin closed up, or a prominence of
some interior coat of the matrix. But it is situate (as I said before)
between the perforation of the fundament and the rump, tending something to the
left hand; which Ulysses Aldrovandus conceives so to be disposed, for more
convenient coition, and more commodious reception of masculine incursion.

But I have often observed, that the Hen does indifferently incline her back
parts toward the Cock, on which side soever he prepare his ascent, be it on
the right or left. I find no Penis, or Yard at all in a Cock, neither could
Fabricius find any, though it appear most manifest in Drakes, and Ganders.
But, instead thereof, I find an Orifice in a Cock (not different from that of
a Hen) but it is less, and narrower; which Orifice is like wise found in the
Swan, the Drake, and the Gander: but the Penis of the Drake and Gander (in the
act of Coition) is sent out of this orifice.

In a black Drake, I saw a Penis of that extent, that after coition, the Duck
pursued it as it trailed upon the ground, with intent to devour it; (deeming,
as I suppose, that it had been a worm) which occasioned the Drake to retract it
sooner then his custom is.

In a Male-Osirich, I found, within this orifice of the Privy-parta a very
large glans, or nut of the yard, and a ruddy nerve, of the form and magnitude
of a Deers tongue, or small Neats tongue; which I observed him many times
brandish in coition, stiff, and something embowed: which, when he had
dispatched into the female, he detained there a good space, without any
commotion of these parts at all, as they had been staked together; yet all the
while strange were the gesticulations of their Heads and Necks (as if they had
approved their Nuptials) proclaiming their full complacence.

I have read in D. du Val, a most learned Physician of Rouen, that a certain
Hermaphrodite was delivered up to the Chirurgians and Midwives, to determine
whether he was a Man or a Woman. They, upon discovery, judged him to be a
woman; and thereupon he was enjoined to habit himself like one of that sex. He
notwithstanding was in the mean time accused of soliciting women, and playing
the man's part. And at last he had a penis issuing out of its hidden prepuce,
(as out of a woman's secrets) which executed the man's office.

I my self once saw a man's penis so shrunk up (excepting only when it was
provoked) that nothing appeared in the wrinkled prepuce above the scrotum, but
the mere extremity of the Glans.

In a Horse, and some other creatures, the vast dimension of that part is shut
forth from within. In a Mole also, that little Animal, there is a great
retraction of the penis into the skin and muscles of the Abdomen; and his
female also has a longer and deeper Matrix then is usual.

I conceive, it is with a Cock, who has no penis, as it is with the lesser
sort of Birds; which quickly conclude their acts of coition, and do perform
them by affriction only. For the Orifices of the Privities (of the Cock and
Hen) by often conjunction, as by repeated salutes, do celebrate coition, not by
one continued inition, (which orifices being turned outward, do protuberate,
wax stiff, and stretch after the manner of a Glans; especially that of the
Cock, which only does outwardly press upon the female, and, as I suppose, does
not enter in.

In the Coition of Horses, Dogs, and Cats, and other creatures, when the male
presents his penis, the female proportioneth her parts stiff, and extended.
And Birds also that are tame, suffer themselves to be gently stroked, and
swelling with Venereal appetite, expose that Orifice, which you may by your
finger perceive to be hardened and resisting. Nay sometimes birds are so
lustful, that if you only gently smooth their backs, they will instantly
incline, and extend and make bare their Uterine Orifice; which if your finger
softly comply with, they will declare their accepted recreation, in extravagant
murmurs, and flutterings of their wings. And that the females will even thence
conceive eggs, both Aristotle bears witness, and I my self have found in a
Thrush, a Blackbird, and others: and this experiment I gained long since, and
by chance, but at my own cost. For my wife had an excellent, and a well
instructed Parrat, which was long her delight; which was now grown so familiar,
that he was permitted to walk at liberty through the whole house: where he
missed his Mistress, he would search her out, and when he had found her, he
would court her with a cheerful congratulation. If she had called him, he
would make answer, and flying to her, he would grasp her garments with his
claws, and bill, till by degrees he had scaled her shoulder; whence he
descending by her arm, did constantly seat himself upon her hand. If she bad
him talk, or sing, were it night, and never so dark, he would obey her. Many
times when he was sportive and wanton, he would sit in her lap, where he loved
to have her scratch his head, and stroke his back, and then testify his
contentment, by kind mutterings, and shaking of his wings. I still interpreted
all this to proceed from his customary familiarity and obsequiousness, for I
always thought him to be a Cock-Parrat, by his notable excellence in singing
and talking. For amongst Birds, the females seldom sing, or provoke to
discourse; but the males only charm the females by the pleasant music of
their voice, and allure them to pay their homage to Venus. And therefore
Aristotle says, If Partridge-hennes stand Hist. an. l. 5. c. 5. and l. 6. c. 2.
over against the cocks, and the wind blow from whence the cocks are, they
conceive and grow big, and for the most part, they teem even by the voice of
the cock, if they be at that time wanton and lustful: and this also may fall
out from the cocks flying over them; namely if the cock do transmit a
fructifying spirit into the Hen. And this happens chiefly in the Springtime;
whence the Poet: Virgil. 2. Georg.


Vere tument terrae, and genitalia semina poscunt.
Tum Pater Omnipotens foecundis imbribus ether.
Conjugis in gremium laetae descendit, and omnes
Magnus alit, magno commistus corpore, foetus.
Avia tum resonant avibus virgulta sonoris,
Et Venerem certis repetunt armenta diebus.
Earth swells in Spring, and fertile seed requires,
Descending Ether with her vote conspires,
And fruitful showrs cheer his glad consorts heart,
Which do to all her Issues growth impart.
The Desert woods are then the shrill Birds Quire,
And all Beasts are inflamed with Venus fire.
But not long after these kind dalliances, the Parrat, which had lived many
years sound and healthy, grew sick, and being much oppressed by many convulsive
motions, did at length deposite his much lamented spirit in his Mistresses
bosom, where he had so often sported. When dissecting his carkase, (to find
out the cause of his death) I found in the womb an egg almost completed, but,
for want of a Cock, corrupted. Which many times befalls those Birds, that
are immured in Cages, when they covet the society of the Cock.

By this and other examples, I am induced to believe, that the Dunghill-Cock,
and the Cock-Pheasant, do not only delight their Hens by their voices, but
also do confer something by those very voices to the conception of the eggs:
for even at night, some of the Hens at roost with him, do bestirre themselves
at the Cocks crowing, shaking their heads and wings; as if possessed by a
gentle horror, their senses were ravished as after Coition.

A certain Foul, as big again as a Swan, was not long since brought into
Holland out of Java, a^ Island of the East Indies, which foul the Dutchmen
called a Cassoware: the figure of this foul Aldrovandus represents, and
says, that the Indians Ornith. lib. 20. p. 541.
call it Eme: it is not cloven-footed, as the Ostrich, but has three claws on
every foot; one of which is armed with so long, so hard, and so strong a
spur, that it will easily pierce through an Inc^board. Now its manner of
smiting is forward; its body, legs, and thighs, are like an Ostriches, but it
has not a broad bill, as the Ostrich has, but a roun^ and black one. Instead
of a crest, it has upon the head a round extuberant horn; it has no tongue at
all; eats any thing without distinction, be it stones, or coals, and those
red-hot too, likewise pieces of glass; it has two feathers springing out from
every quill, and those black, short, and thin, approaching to the nature of
hair, or down; it has very little wings, and imperfect; it is a creature of a
horrid aspect, and has long red and blew gils hanging down the neck (like a
Turkey-Cock.)

This foul continued in Holland above seven years, and afterward Maurice,
the most Illustrious Prince of Orange sent it, with other things, for a Present
to King James, in whose gardens it lived above five years: but afterward, when
two Ostriches, Cock and Hen, chanced to be kept in the same place, and the
Cassoware oftentimes overheard them at the act of coition, being but in the
next pens (where they were fed apart) She unexpectedly conceived eggs
(stirred up, as I suppose, by a certain sympathy, from those that were
something of the same kin and lineage with her) yet all that saw her, did
conjecture she was rather a Cock, then a Hen, considering her we apons and
martial provisions. One of these eggs she laid whole and entire, which I
opened and found it complete; for it had a white embracing the yolk round
about, together with the chalazae, or specks like hailestones annexed on both
sides, and also a little cavity or emptiness in the obtuse end of it: there was
likewise the cicatricula, the little cicatrice, or whitish speck; the shell was
thick, hard, and strong, which I caused to be made into a cup (the top being
taken off) such as is usually made of the Ostriches egg. This egg was
something less then an Ostriches egg, but every way perfect, as I said before;
yet without all question it was but a subventaneous and an unfruitful one, by
reason of the want of a Cock. But at the same time as she brought forth the
egg, I did presage she her self would die; and that according to Aristotle,
who says, That Birds will be sick and dye, unless they bring forth, which fell
out not long Genesis an. l. 3
after: and dissecting her, I found an imperfect and corrupt egg in the Upper
end of her Uterus, which caused her untimely death, (as I had formerly observed
in the Parrat and other Birds.)

Most Birds, by how much the more salacious they are, so much the more
fruitful are they; and sometimes do without a Cock (either from high feeding,
or some other cause) conceive eggs, which very seldom are either perfected, or
brought forth at all, without the use of a Cock; but they thenoe fall into
desperate diseases, and at length dye.

But the Dunghill-henne does not only conceive eggs, but lay them also; and
those perfect too, but yet subventaneous and barren ones. So also many of the
Insects (in whose list are Silkworms and Butterflies) do both conceive, and
lay eggs, without conjunction with the male, (as fishes also) but they are all
addle, and wind-eggs. As if it were the same thing for these creatures to be
with egg, as for virgins to have their wombs grow warm; their terms flow,
their breasts increase, and (in a word) to become marriageable; which if they
be too long detained from, they are assaulted with dangerous symptoms; (namely
hysterical affections, or furor Uterinus) or else fall into the green sickness,
and several other distempers. For all Creatures, when they are love-struck,
grow extravagant, and if debarred of enjoyment, do at length recede much from
their usual temper. Hence some women grow frantic for love; and this
extravagancy is so outrageous in some, that they seem bewitched, planetstrucke,
or possessed. And this inconvenience would be frequent, did not pious
education, respect to their reputation, and inbred modesty, temper and assuage
these inordinate commotions of the mind.

Of the Privities of a Hen.
EXER. VI.
FRom the exterior uterine orifice, is the passage to the inner parts, and
matrix, in which the egg is perfected: and this passage in other creatures is
termed vagina uteri, or vulva, into which the males penis is transmitted to the
matrix. But in a Hen, this passage is so perplexed, and so wrinckled and
folded, by reason of the laxity of its inward coat, that though there be an
easy passage from the matrix outward, insomuch that a very great egg can come
forth without any great difficulty; yet that the masculine penis should get in,
and that the seed should find admission into the inner cavity of the Uterus,
is scarce probable: for I could not trace a way inward, with either probe, or
bristle, nor could Fabricius neither; nay, if you will credit his testimony,
the very air cannot be blown into the womb: which, I suppose, was the cause
why he, describing the history of the Egg, proceeds from the interior to
the exterior parts: And also considering this fabric of the womb, he denies
page 30.
the seed to attain so far as the cavity of the womb, or to constitute any
part of the egg: of which opinion I willingly profess my self. For you shall
find nothing at all in a fertile egg, either added, or altered, (which is not
in an addle one) to give any suspicion of the entrance of the Cocks seed into
the womb or egg. But yet though all the eggs are, without the accession of
the Cock, subventaneous and addle; yet by his assistance (even for a good while
after his treading) the subsequent eggs, of which there is yet no principle,
or matter out of which they can be made, become fertile. Fabricius, that he may
express after what manner the seed of the Cock makes the eggs fertile, page
17.
has these words: Since no seed at all appears in the egg, and yet it is
cast by the cock into the womb, it may be demanded, to what purpose the cocks
seed is cast into the womb, if it pass not into the egg? as also, if the seed
be not in the egg, how can the egg be made fertile by that seed which is not
in it? My opinion is, that the seed of the cock injected into the beginning of
the womb, does make the whole womb, and also all the yolks that come into it,
and lastly, the whole egg, fertile; and that it does this by its virtue, or
spiritual irradiating substance; after the same manner, as we perceive other
creatures become fertile, by the testicles, and seed: for if any man consider
that incredible transmutation, which does seize upon a creature that is gelded,
by which it loses its heat, vigor, and fecundity in the whole body; he will
easily consent, that what we say, may well befall the single womb of a Hen. But
that it is most true, that the power of rendering all the eggs fertile,
together with the womb it self, proceeds wholly from the seed of the Cock,
appears, even from the practice of women, which having a Hen without a Cock,
commit her for a day or two to a neighbors Cock: and from this small commerce,
all the eggs are endowed with fertility, for all that year. And this is also
confirmed by Aristotle, who is of opinion, that de Genesis an. l. 3. c. 1.
after birds have once had the advantage of coition, almost all the eggs they
lay afterward are fertile. Now, lest the virtue of making fertile, which is
contained in page 38.
the seed, should by any means exhale or evaporate, but that it may remain
long in the womb, and so be imparted to the whole; nature has concluded, and
treasured it up as it were in a purse, in the cavity near the fundament, which
is annexed to the womb, to which there is only an entrance, but no retreat, so
that the seed being there long detained, its virtue may be the better
preserved, and communicated to the whole womb.

But I did doubt the verity of the foresaid experiment, and that the rather,
because I perceived the Philosophers words were falsely recited; for, he does
not say, that, Birds, when they once have had the advantage of coition, almost
all the eggs they lay are fertile, but, they lay almost all their eggs: where
the word Fertile is superadded by Fabricius: for it is one thing, to say, that
Birds are with egg after coition; and another thing, to say, that those eggs
are made fertile by coition. And this is more manifest by Aristotle's precedent
words, where he says, In Birds, not so much as those very eggs which are
begotten by coition, can for the most part gain their just growth, unless that
coition be continued. And the reason is, because, that as in women by coition
with the male, the menstruous excrement is drawn forth (for the womb being
warmed draws the moisture, and the pores are opened) so it falls out in
birds, whilst the menstruous excrement comes by little and little, which cannot
get out, because it is but little, and is contained above about the diaphragma,
but slideth down into the womb it self. For with this the egg is nourished, as
the foetus of viviparous creatures is nourished with that which comes in at the
Navel. For after birds have once been at tread, they still persist to have
almost all their eggs, but yet small ones, and imperfect; and therefore barren:
for the perfection of an egg, is its fecundity. If therefore without continued
coition, not so much as those very eggs which are conceived by that coition, do
attain their Growth, or (as Fabricius interprets it) their Perfection; much
less can those eggs be fertile, which the Birds persist to lay, without
coition.

But let no man think that these words (namely, the womb being warmed draws,
and the pores are opened) do any way conclude, that the womb can draw the seed
of the Cock into its cavity; for we must take notice, that the Philosopher
does not say, that the womb draws the seed from without, but, that in women,
the menstruous blood is drawn out of their own bodies, the veins and passages
being opened by the heat caused by coition; and so likewise in Birds, that the
blood is drawn to the womb, it being warmed by repeated coition, and that the
eggs do thence increase; as the foetus of viviparous creatures do by the Navel.
But what he adjoineth concerning that cavity or purse, in which he fancyeth
that the seed is entertained, even for a whole year together, is confuted by us
formerly; where we affirm, that no seed at all is contained in it and that both
henns and cocks indifferently have that cavity.

Wherefore, though I easily believe (if by fertility we understand an increase
of more and fairer eggs) that poor women's henns (whose poultry probably wants
good feeding) will lay lesser and fewer eggs, except they have resort to a
cock (according to that of the Philosopher, namely, If they once mix with a
cock, then they continue to have fairer, better, and more eggs, for the whole
ensuing year; to which end also, plenty and wholesomness of feeding do very
much conduce) yet that hens, by some few acts of coition with a cock should
lay all fertile eggs for a whole year together; that, I say, seems to me
improbable. For if a few acts of coition were of force to so lasting a
generation, Nature (which makes nothing in vain) would have made the male
birds less salacio^ then they are: nor would the cock so often in one day
invite his hens to Venery, nay sometimes force a rape upon them.

We all know, how the hen, so soon as she forsakes the nest where she has
laid her egg cries out with a shrill voice, and enticeth the cock to
coition; who also replying with a loud and divided tone, carefully seeks her
out, and having found her, instantly ascends: which surely Nature had never
permitted, but for procreation sake.

A Cock-Pheasant, penned up in an aviary, both with such scorching lust, that
unless he have sewrall hens with him, (six at the lest) he will ^^ extremely
afflict them with repeated Coitions, and rather retard their fertility, then
promote it ^^^ once saw a Pheasant-henne, so spent and worn o^^ by the cock
who was shut up with her (whom she could no ways escape, neither by flight,
nor concealment) that her back was grown bald by his frequent ascents, until
at last, in miserable torture, ^^e expired for grief. Yet, when I cut her up, I
sound not the lest rudinient of an egg. I have observed likewise a Gander, who
wanting a mate, sojourned with the hens, where his lust was so unbounded,
that for some hours together he pursued a young pullet whithersoever she fled,
arresting her with his bill, till at length he triumphed upon her weariness,
and subdued her to a Rape.

A dunghill-cock having gotten the mastery in the duel, does sat his desires
not only upon the concubines of his foe, but upon the conquered himself.

So likewise some females are so prone to Venery, that they will chastise their
males with their biteings; (as if they meant to whisper and advise them of
conjugal delights) sometimes getting uppermost themselves, endeavoring by
these and other arts to entice them to their recreation: and in this rank are
pigeons, and sparrows.

And therefore it seems not so likely, that a few coitions celebrated in the
beginning of the year, should store up fecundity enough, to endow all the
eggs for a twelve-moneth following.

And yet once (that Fabricius may have some patronage) in the Spring time
(attempting some discovery of the time wherein coition is most successful, and
the necessity thereof) I did separate two hens from the cock for four days
space, which in that time laid three eggs a piece, which were as prolifical as
the rest. And I did after that immure another hen, which on the tenth day of
her separation laid an egg, and another egg on the twentieth, and both were
fruitful: so that it may seem possible, that one or two acts of conjunction
may fructify the whole cluster, and consequently all the eggs of that year.

I shall tell you likewise, what I farther observed at that time; when I
restored the two hens (which I had formerly divorced) to the cock again,
whereof one of them was now big with egg, the other had newly laid; the cock
ran instantly to the latter, and enjoyed her greedily three or four times:
about the former, he circuited often, and by trailing his wings at her feet,
seemed to greet her kindly, and congratulate her return; yet presently retired
to the other, and repeated his lust again, and again, committing violence upon
her refusal; neglecting in the mean time the henn that was with egg, using no
solicitation nor request. Truly I admired, by what significations he could be
inspired to know, that coition could be useful to the one, and unseasonable to
the other. It is not easy to say, how males will either by the eye, ear, or
smell, distinguish (even from far) which females are ripe for their turn,
and desirous of their company. Some, though they only hear their voice, or
sent their urine, or footsteps only on the ground are presently heightened, and
pursue them to a compliance. But of this elsewhere, in our tract o^ the Love,
Lust, and act of Generation of Animals, w^ shall treat at large. We return to
our purpose.

Of the Belly of a Hen, and other Birds.
EXERCIT. VII.
FRom the outward Orifice through the privy parts, we arrive at the Uterus or
matrix of the Hen, wherein the egg is perfected, encompassed by the white,
and covered with the shell; but before we speak any thing of its situation,
and position, something must be premised, concerning the peculiar anatomy of
the Belly of Birds. For I have observed the stomachs, guts, and other entrals
of Feathered creatures, to be otherwise seated and constituted in their lower
belly, then of other creatures that go upon the ground.

All kinds of Birds, almost, have a twofold stomach, whereof one is the
Ingluvies, the other the Ventriculus, properly so called: in the former they
treasure up their meat, and prepare it; in the latter, they digest it, and
concoct it into the chyle: the first, we call the crop or craw; the latter, the
Gisard. Birds reserve in their craw the whole grains which they ingorge, and
from thence transmit them into the gisard, moistened, macerated, and softened by
the water which they imbibe, that it may there be grinded, and concocted. And
for that purpose, almost all sorts of Foul swallow down sands, stones, and
other harder bodies, and reserve them in their gisard with their meat; (when no
such thing is to be seen in their craw) and this gisard of theirs is compacted
of two exceeding thick^st strong muscles, (which in lesser Birds are composed
of flesh or ligaments) that with these two, as it were with two Grind-stones,
fastened together with two hinges, they may grind and mould their food; whilst
the stones supply the place of teeth, of which they are destitute. By this
means they digest and chylifie their meat, and afterward by compression (as we
strain a juice or a pultis out of herbs or fruits bruised) the softer and more
liquid part lies uppermost; and that they conveigh into the beginning of the
guts (which in them is just at the entrance into the gullet, seated above the
gisard. Now that this is so, appears in several sorts of Birds, in whose
gisard, if gravel, or any other harder and rugged bodies continue any time,
they receive so much impair and smoothness from the continual attrition, that
at last they grow useless, and so are ejected. And for this cause Birds
exercise their tongues in the choice of their pibbles, and if they discover
that they are no^ rough, they presently refuse them. By this mean^ I have found
Iron, Silver, and Stones, almost worn away and consumed in the gisard of an
Ostrich, and the Cassoware; which gives occasion to the popular persuasion,
that they digest Iron, and are nourished by it.

In Falcons, Eagles, and other Birds of Prey, if you bring your ear near, when
their gisard is empty you shall evidently discover the noise of stones
collected in it, grating one against another. For Hawks do not swallow
pibbles to cool and all^ their heat, (as the common sort of Falconers dream)
but to grind their meat: as also other Birds (whose gisard is made fleshy on
purpose t^ mould their meat) for the same intent, do ingor^^ pibbles, or sand,
or such like bodies.

The gisard of Birds therefore, is seated within the capacity of the Abdomen,
beneath the Heart, Lungs, and Liver; but the crop sticks (for the most part)
as it were out of the body, in the lower part of the neck, at the Os Jugale:
in which (as I have said) their meat is only mollified, and prepared: and from
it some Birds return their meat macerated to their chickens, and nurse them up
(at the same rate as four-footed beasts do theirs with milk) as you may
observe in all sorts of Pigeons, and also in the Spermologi, which we call
Rooks. And Bees also, when they are returned to their Hives, do refund the honey
which they gather from the flowers, and have digested in their stomach, into
their proper celles: and so do Hornets and Wasps nourish their offspring. And
a Bitch has been seen to disgorge the meat which she had swallowed before, and
half concocted, to supply her whelps. Wherefore, the wonder is less, when we
see poor beggar-women, when their milk fails them, to feed their Infants
with scraps, which their own teeth have first prepared, and reduced into a
kind of pap.

The Guts in Birds arise (as is said) from the upper part of the Gisard, and
are replicated up and down in Longitude (not transversly, as in us.) And next
to them, just under the heart, about the middle of the body, where the
diaphragma (which is wanting in Birds) is seated in Beasts, is their Liver,
which is very large, and divided into two lobes, (for they have no spleen
neither) placed on either side, and fills the hypochondria: below the Liver is
the gisard put, under which lie the replications of the intestines, having very
many slender membranes interposed, which are filled with air: for into these
(as we have said) the rough arteries of the lungs descend with open mouth. The
kidneys (which are large in Birds) being of an oblong figure, composed as it
were of gobbets of flesh, having no cavities at all, do lie on both sides of
the Spine, and great descending vein and Artery, and are buried in the
spacious oblong cavity of the huckle bones or sides-men. From the forepart of
the kidneys are the Ureters extended in Longitude, even to the common sink,
and fundament it self: that so the serous excrement may from the Reins be
wafted thither. Now Birds have very little of this serum, because they are small
drinkers, and some of them (as the Eagle for one) drink not all. Nor does their
urine flow apart by its self; but, as we have said, does distill from the
Ureters into the common receptacle, which is allowed also to entertain the
excrement of the guts, whose discharge is by this means the better provided
for. The urine of Birds differs from that of other creatures; for the parts
of their urine are twofold, one more serous, and liquid, the other more gross
and thick, which in men in health we call the hypostasis, and when the urine
is now cold, it sinketh down to the bottom: now Birds (clean contrary to other
viviparous Animals) have greater store of this thick sediment; which is
distinguished from the other part of the urine, by its white or silver-like
complexion, and it is not only discernable in the cloaca or sink, (where it
much abounds) and gives a tincture to the excrements of the guts: but in the
whole conduct of the Ureters, which are distinguished from the coats of the
kidneys, by this very white excrement. Nor is the thicker substance which
descends from the Reins, only visible in Birds, but in Serpents also, and
other oviparous creatures; especially those whose egg is guarded by a harder
kind of shell. And they have much more abundance of this, then of the thinner
serous part: and it has a middle consistence between a thicker kind of urine,
and the excrement of the guts; so that as it passes through the Ureters, it
resembles milk coagulated, or something thickened, and presently upon ejection
it congealeth into a crust that is friable.

Of the situation and fabric of the rest of the parts of the Womb in a Hen.
EXERCIT. VIII.
BEtween the Gisard, and the Liver, at the Spine of the back, where in men and
other animals the Pancreas lies, between the vena Porta, and descending trunck
of vena Cava, at the beginning of the Emulgent veins, and the preparing
spermatical vessels, where the Coeliacal artery goes into the Mesentery,
there also in a Hen and other Birds, is the Ovary, and cluster of yolks
bred, which has Before it the Trunk of the Vena Porta, the gullet, and the
mouth of the Gisard; and Behind it, the Hollow vein, and the Great Artery
descending by the Spine of the back; Above it lies the Liver, Under it the
Gisard. And therefore the Infundibulum, which is constituted of a very thin
membrane, descends down-ward from the Ovary, all along the back, between it
and the Gisard. And from the Infundibulum or Tunnel (between the Gisard, Guts,
Reins, and Loins) the Process of the Uterus, or its superior part, having
many revolutions and cells (like the Colon and right-gut in a man) descends
into the Womb it self. But the Womb it self, which is continuous to this
Process, is seated below the Gisard at the Fundament, at the lower end of the
Abdomen, between the loins, kidneys, and right-gut: so that when the egg now
clothed with the White is contained in it, it presses down so low, that you
may easily perceive by your finger, whether it be soft, or hard, and ready to
be laid.

This Womb, in a Hen, is of different magnitude and fabric: For in a Hen
which is big with egg, or has lately laid, it differs very much from the
womb of a Virgin-henne, or Pullet; for her womb is fleshy and round, lik an
empty purse; smooth without, within rough, having certain folds and revolutions
according to its longitude: at first sight, you would conceive it to be a
larger kind of bladder of Urine, or a second lesser gisard. But in a teeming
Hen, and one ripe for the cock (which our housewives distinguish by the
redness of their crest, or comb) the Uterus is of much better growth, and more
carnous, having larger folds, and thicker, and of that extent, that it may
conveniently receive an egg. And this womb is extended and passes upward a
good way, along the Spine of the back, and is made up of many complications and
cells; (as the Collick-gut is) which several cells are composed of the
replications of the womb it self. The Bottom hereof, as it is the largest, so
it is the thickest, and most carnous part of all, fortified with more and
greater foldings then the rest, whose figure within is Ovale, as if it were the
Mould to cast eggs in. I call the Ascending part, or production of the Womb, a
Process: Fabricius calls it, the second Uterus, and says it consists of
three rundells or turnings: Ulysses Aldrovandus calls it the stomach of the
womb: there are, I confess, most commonly three spires or rundels, yet this is
not so constant, but that nature fashions it otherwise, for variety, (as she
does sometimes in the circumgirations of the Colon.

This womb, the higher it goes, the slenderer and sparer it grows by
degrees, and has fewer and lesser circumvolutions, till at length as it were
dissolving into very thin membranes, it becomes to be the Infundibulum, which
arising up as far as the diaphragme, encompasseth all the Ovary.

And therefore Fabricius divides his second womb into three parts; viz. the
beginning, the middle, and page 17.
the end. The beginning, says he, degenerating into a stender and most soft
membrane, frames a wide orifice, representing as it were a little pipe or
tunnel. The middle part (which I call the Process of the Uterus) is constituted
of three transverse spires or Rundels, and serves to furnish the yolk of the
egg with a white, and extends it self to the lowest and most capacious place
or part of all; which he calls the End of that Uterus, wherein (says he) the
Chalazae, or specks, and the two membranes and shell are formed.

The whole substance of the Uterus (especially about the folds) as well in the
Uterus it self, as in its Process, is embroydered with many large veins, and
yet there are more divarications of Arteries then of Veins.

The Folds which in the inside of the womb are oblique and transverse, are of a
fleshy substance, and look exceeding white and milkey, breathing forth a kind
of stiff moisture; so that the inward superficies both of the Uterus, and also
of its Process, is lined as it were with very much, and thin whites of eggs;
by which means the descending yolk gains greater bulk, and cloatheth it self
in white by degrees, till it arrive at full perfection.

You shall seldom find the Uterus unfurnished of eggs, but that there are some
still either sticking in the revolutions of the Process of the womb, or else
contained in the Uterus or womb it self. If you blow up this Process when it
is empty, it will appear like a little oblique distorted pipe, rising up sharp
at the end in manner of a snailes shell, or a Top. And the Fabric of the womb
is like that which we lately observed in the privy parts; namely, that though
there be open way enough to receive the egg in its descent, yet there is
scarce any return to be obtained upwards again, (even for the air it self,
though backed by inflation.)

The Process of the Uterus, together with the spires, is so diminished in a Hen
past laying (as we have said) and also in young pullets, that it resolves into
most thin membranes, and is quite abolished, and leaves no appearance of it,
as neither of the Ovary, or Infundibulum; only there remains (like the root of
the cluster) a glandulous and spongy substance, which tastes pretty sweet in a
boiled Hen; as in Viviparous creatures (especially if they be young and tender)
the Pancreas, and Thymus do; which therefore the people call the Sweet-Breads.

The Womb, together with its Process, is by the help of a membrane fastened to
the back: which membrane Fabricius does therefore call Mesometrium; because,
the second womb, together with this membranous body, wherein many veins are
divaricated, may fitly be compared to the Intestines, and their Mesentery. For
as the Mesentery keeps firm the Guts, so does that Mesometrium fasten this
long Process from the chine, lest being dislocated, and involved, it should
disturb and obstruct the passage of the yolks, whereas now being free and open,
it entertaineth them gently. Through this Mesometrium, many vessels stored with
blood, are branched into every replication of the womb. And therefore it
bears much analogy to the Mesentery, both in its beginning, substance,
fabric, use, and office. There is also a Ligament (like a fillet) extended
long-wayes from the bottom of the womb to the Infundibulum, such a one as we
may see produced in the upper region of the Colon; which is as it were a
portion or fragment of the outward coat, going along and contracted, that the
rest of the Process might by its help be wrinckled into folds and replications.
Thus, if you cut off a gut, and put in a thread into it all along the whole
length of one side of it, and then tie it hard, the other opposite side will
curle up into wrinckled complications and windings.

This then is the Constitution of the womb of a Hen that lays eggs;
namely, fleshy, large, ductile and extensive into length and breadth, full of
windings, spires, and convolutions all along the spine of the back from the
fundament, upwards, and continuous to the Infundibulum.

Of the generation of the Egg.
EXERCIT. IX.
THe yolk, in the cluster, is only a little wheale or push, and growing by
degrees, attaineth the complexion and bulk of a yolk; and falling off from the
cluster, it descends through the Infundibulum; and rolling through the Spires
and cavernes of the Process of the womb, does cloth it self all over with the
White: though (as Fabricius rightly observed against Aristotle) it does adhere
to the womb no where at all, nor is it nourished by any Umbilical vessels: but
as the eggs of frogs or fishes, provide themselves whites out of the waters
wherein they lie; or as beans, pease, and other pulse and grain, being
moistened, do swell, and thence acquire aliment to the blossoms which spring
from them: So in like manner out of the aforesaid foulds of the womb, an
albugineous humidity issuing thence (as it were out of a dugge, or Uterine
cake) the Yolk (by virtue of a vegitative heat, and faculty wherewith it is
endowed) finds out, and concocteth its white. And therefore in those foulds,
and in the cavity of the Uterus, a liquor, in taste much like the white of an
egg, does most plenteously abound. And in this sort the yolk descending by
little and little, is invested with a white, until at last, assuming membranes,
and a harder shell in the extremity of the womb, he is completed for his Exit.

Of the Growth and departure of the Egg from the Womb.
EXER. X.
ATtend Fabricius: as we pronounce (says he) the action of the Stomach to be
Chylification: and page 8.
the action of the Testicles to be the Generation of Seed; because we find
chyle in the Stomach, and Seed in the Testicles: So we confidently affirm the
Action of the Birds womb, to be the Generation of eggs, because there we find
the eggs. But this is not the only Function of the womb, but the Augmentation
of the egg also, which succeeds immediately after the Generation, till the
egg be perfected, and purchase a just enlargement, is employed. For the Hen
does not naturally lay her egg, before it be complete, and have attained a
convenient magnitude. The Action therefore of the Uterus is both the
Generation, and Augmentation of the egg: Now Augmentation supposes Nutrition,
and includes it. But since all Generation proceeds from two Principles;
namely, the Efficient, and the Subject Matter: The Efficient in the procreation
of eggs is nothing else, but the Instruments, or proposed organs, namely, the
twofold Uterus: and the Subject Matter, is nothing but Blood.

But we, for Brevity sake (omitting, as is meet, all controversy) as we do
easily allow, that the use and office of the womb, is to procreate eggs: so we
pronounce the Adaequate Efficient (as they call it) to be contained in the egg
it self: and we do conceive that both the Generation, and Augmentation of the
Egg, proceeds not from the womb, but from an innate natural principle of its
own: And that this Principle does flow first from the whole Hen, into the
Yolk while it yet is only a rudiment, or first wheale as it were; which
afterward like a congenial heat, or Efficient Nature) inherent in the Yolk,
nourishes and Augmenteth it: As there is a certain inbred faculty in every
part of the Body, by which it is fed and augmented. As concerning the manner
how the Yolk is invested with the White, Aristotle seems to de Genesis an. l. 3.
c. 2.
have conceited it to be thus: That there is in eggs, while their membranes are
yet tender, a kind of Umbilicall channel, existent in the sharper end of the eg
(at which he determines the eg to begin) by which it increases: which
persuasion Fabricius reprehendeth, denying any being at all to any such
channel; Or that the Yolk does any where adhere to the womb: and salveth that
scruple concerning that small appendix found in the egg after it is laid,
saying; The augmentation of the egg is twofold, page 11.
according to the twofold womb, that is the superin, and inferior: and also,
according to the twofold substance, whereof the egg is compounded, that is,
the Yolk and the White; the Yolk is increased by a true Augmentation; namely,
by blood; which is conveyed to it by the Veins, whilst it is yet adjoined to
the Vitellary. But the White is increased, and grows to the yolk, after
another fashion: For it receives not nourishment by the Veins, nor by a true
kind of Nutrition, as the Yolk does but by Juxtaposition, adhering to the Yolk,
while it passes through the Second Uterus.

But in my Opinion, the Egg is augmented after the same manner (wheresoever it
be) as the yolk is augmented in the cluster, viz. from an Intrinsecal
concocting principle, with this distinction only, that while it is in the
cluster, its aliment is conveyed to it by the vessels, but in the womb it
finds it ready for it to imbibe. For in all Nutrition and Accretion, a
Juxtaposition of the parts is equally necessary, and also a Concoction and
Distribution of the applied nutriment; nor can the one be thought to be less a
True Nutrition then the other: for both of them are made by a new accession,
apposition, agglutination, and transmutation of the Aliment. Nor can Beans or
Pease, which attract moisture from the Earth (which they suck in like spunges)
be said to be less truly nourished, then if they did draw in that moisture
through the Orifice of Veins: And Trees also drinking Dewes and Showers in at
their Barks, are as truly nourished, as they are by their Roots. But concerning
the manner of this Nutrition, we have spoken more largely in another place. At
present, it remains that we encounter another difficulty; that is, whether the
Yolke, while it acquireth a White, does not make some separation, and choice in
it: and so, while it is about augmenting, whether some more earthy part be not
dismissed into the Yolk or middle of the egg, (as into the Center, as
Aristotle would have it) and the lighter, and thinner parts be not reserved in
its superficies or surface: For between the Yolk which is yet in the cluster,
and that which is in the midst of the eg when it is perfected, this is the
difference in chief, that though the former be yellowish in color and
appearance, yet its consistence represents rather the White; and being
sodden, thickneth like it, grows compact, and viscous, and may be cut into
slices. But the Yolk that is in the midst of a perfect egg, being boiled,
grows friable, and of a more earthy consistence, not thick and glutinous like
the White.

Of the Egg-shell.
EXERCITATION XI.
IT is convenient, that having declared how the Egg is generated, we should
now treat of its parts, and their differences. An Egg is compounded page 22.
(says Fabricius) of a Yolke, a White, two Chalazae, or specks, three
membranes (namely one membrane proper to the yolk alone, and two other, common
to the whole egg) and last of all, of a Shell. To all which, two things are to
be added, which may not be truly ranged amongst the parts of the egg; one
whereof is a certain small cavity in the blunter end of the egg near the top
of the Shell; the other is a certain little white print, like a small round
Cicatrice, affixed to the superficies of the yolk. The account of every of
which we shall lay down more punctually, beginning from the outward parts. The
outward Covering (which is by Pliny called the Bark, Rind, or Paring; and by
((...) Serenus, the Egg-shell) is a hard, slender, friable, and porous
tegument, having diverse colors, namely, white, pallid, red, spotted, and
sprinkled with several p^^ctures: to wit, the Hens, and Pigeons egg-shells
(...) white; the Water-fowles, pale; the Hawks, or Kestrells, red as
Vermilion; the Pheasants, spotted, and distinguished with points, as Aristotle
notes. All eggs have not a shell; for Serpents eggs have none; and de Hist.
an. l. 6. c. 2.
some hens (though rarely) lay eggs without a shell This shell, though it be
hard, is not equally hard in all parts, but is more hard about the top, and
superior part of the egg. And therefore Fabricius says, It is a question,
when the egg-shell is formed, and out of page 13.
what subject matter. For Aristotle and Pliny affirm, that the shell is not
made within, but when the egg is Hist. an. l. 6. c. 2. and genesis an. 1. 8. l.
10. c. 52. de genesis an. l. 3. c. 2.
laid, and as it is going out; so that the outward heat drying up the moisture,
the Air condenseth and hardneth it. And this is done, as Aristotle supposes,
both that it may have the easer passage, and also that it may not pain the
parent: As they say that an egg softened in vinegar, may be crowded into a
vessel of a narrow neck.

Fabricius indeed was long at odds with this opinion, by reason he had found an
egg with a hard shell in the belly of the Hen; an experiment which is daily
proved by house-wives, whilst endeavoring to know whether the Hen be ready to
lay, they grope the belly without, to try whether the shell be hard. But
afterward, when he had received from creditable women, that the egg-shell
assumed its obduration from the ^ire in its exit, which air does exiccate a
stiff moisture which environeth the egg, and condenseth and fastneth it to
the shell, before the shell of it self be exactly hard: and having also
discovered the same by his own experience, he altered his opinion, and was
persuaded, that the egg in the Uterus has truly a shell, which shell is of a
middle consistence, between soft and hard, but that it obtains a much greater
degree of obduration presently after it is laid, by reason of a certain clammy
tenacious humidity which concealeth about the shell, occasioned by the
evaporation ^f the thin and moist parts; with which humidity the whole
superficies is bedewed, which adhering to the tender shell, is dried and
hardened, the cold ambient air ^mducing something thereunto. And this (says
he) you may soon perceive, if you keep Hens in your yard, and be dexterous
and diligent to receive the eggs from them, as they lay.

This opinion of Aristotle did for a long time prevail with me, till I
discovered the contrary by infallible experience. For I take it as a measured
truth, that the Egee-shell is most commonly hard even in the womb itself. And I
once saw an egg cut out of a live Hen, which had no shell at all, but yet
was througly drenched and begin with a glewey moisture: and yet the egg never
hardened at all, by the congelation, or evaporation of the moisture about the
Skin, (as Fabricius would have it) nor was it any whit altered by the ambient
cold air, but continued the tenderness which it had in the womb. I have also
seen a Newlaied egg, which had a complete hard shell, over which was a case
made of a cuticular soft membrane, which membrane did never congeal. Moreover I
have seen an egg exactly surrounded with a Shell, save only on the very top of
the acute end of the egg, where remained a small soft rising, such a one as
Aristotle perhaps conceived to be the Relics of the Navel.

And therefore Fabricius seems to me to be in an error; for though I was
never so good at slight of Hand, to surprise an egg in the very laying, and so
make discovery whether it was soft or hard; yet this I confidently pronounce,
that the Shell is compounded within the womb, of a substance there at hand for
the purpose: and that it is framed in the same manner as the other parts of the
egg are, by the Plastic faculty: and the rather, because I have seen an
exceeding small egg, (Fabricius calls it Ovum Centeninum, and our Women call
it the Cocks egg) which had Shell of its own, and yet was contained within
another egg, greater, and fairer then it, which egg also had a Shell too. And
this Egg I showed King Charles my most gracious Master, in presence of many
others. And that very year, cutting up a large Limon, I found another small,
but yet a perfect Limon in it, which had also a yellow rind: Which thing is now
frequent in Italy, as I am informed.

It is the usual error of the Philosophers of these times, to seek the
diversity of the causes of Parts, out of the diversity of the matter, from
whence they should be framed. So Physicians affirm, that the different parts of
the body are fashioned and nourished by the different materials of Blood, or
Seed; namely the softer parts, as the Flesh, out of a thinner matter; and the
more earthy parts, as the Bones, etc. out of gross, and harder. But this
error now too much received, we have confuted in another Place. Nor are they
less deceived, who make all things out of Atoms, as Democritus; or out of the
Elements, as Empedocles. As if (forsooth) Generation were nothing in the world,
but a mere Separation, or Collection, or Order of things. I do not indeed deny,
but that to the Production of one thing out of another, these forementioned
things are requisite: But Generation her self is a thing quite distinct from
them all. (I find Aristotle in this opinion) and I my self intend to clear it
anon; that out of the same White of the Egg (which all men confess to be a
similar body, and without diversity of Parts) all and every the parts of a
Chicken, whether they be Bones, Claws, Feathers, Flesh, or what ever else, are
procreated and fed. Besides, they that argue thus, assigning only a Material
cause, deducing the causes of Natural things, from a voluntary or casual
concurrence of the Elements, or from the several disposition or contriving of
Atoms: they do not reach that which is chiefly concerned in the Operations of
Nature, and in the Generation, and Nutrition of Animals: namely, the Divine
Agent, and God of Nature, whose operations are guided with the highest
artifice, providence, and wisdom, and do all tend to some certain end, and
are all produced, for some certain Good.) But these men derogate from the
honor of the Divine Architect, who has made the Shell of the Egg with as
much skill, for the eggs defense, as any other particle; disposing the whole
out of the same matter, and by one and the same formative faculty.

Now though what I have delivered is very true, (namely, that the egg whilst
it is yet in the womb, is guarded with a hard Shell) yet I have still prized
Aristotle's judgment so highly, that I never would recede from his Oracles
without premeditation, and therefore I do conceave (which thing also my own
observations do confirm) that some accession to the induration of the
egge-shell, does accrue from the ambient air in its very exit: and that, that
stiff and slimy moisture, (wherein it is drenched at its being laid) does
presently after its exclusion harden. For the Shell, while it is yet in the
womb, is much thinner, more transparent, and of a smoother superficies: But
after laying, it is much thicker, less translucid, and of a rough Superficies
(as if it were rough cast with a white powder, which had newly dried to
insides.)

And now we are upon this subject, give me leave to expatiate a while.

In the Eastern barren Islands of Scotland, there is such a mighty affluence of
all-most all sorts of of Sea-fowle, that if I should relate all that I have
heard, though from persons of great integrity, I fear I should be suspected
more Fabulous then those several Authors, who discourse of the Scottish or
Soland-Geese, which they story to be born from the fruit of certain Trees
falling into the Sea (which fruit or Geese, themselves never saw) However I
shall venture to relate what my own Eyes have seen.

There is a little Island, the Scots call it Basse, (by this, Reader, guess at
the rest of them) it is not far from the shore, seated in the Main Sea;
standing upon a rugged and dangerous Clift, (you may call it rather one great
continued Stone, or Rock, then an Island) it is not above a mile about. The
superficies of this Island (in the months of May and June) is almost covered
quite over with Nests, Eggs, and Young-Ones, that for their infinite abundance,
you can scarce set your foot in a spare place, and such a mighty flock hovereth
over the Island, that (like thick clouds) they darken and obscure the day: and
such a cry, and noise they make, that you can hardly hear those that stand next
you. If you look down into the Sea beneath you (as from a steep Tower, or
Precipice) you shall see it all spread over with several sort of foul,
swimming to and fro, in pursuit of their Prey. Just at the rate, as some
ditches and lakes in the Spring time, are paved with Frogs; and open Hills, and
steep mountains, are stuck and embossed with flocks of sheep, and Goats. If you
sail round the Island, and look up into the several Clifts, and Cavernes of
it, you shall find them all peopled and inhabited with several colonies of
Birds and Foul, of distinct Kind, and magnitude: more indeed, then in a clear
night, when the Moon is absent, there are Stars to be discerned in the
Firmament: and if you observe the several Regiments of those that saily out,
and those that flocks home wards at the same time, you would take them for an
infinite swarm of Bees. It is not to be imagined what a vast yearly revenue the
Lord of the Island makes of the Plumes, and the Remainders of the Nests (which
are useful for firing) together with the Eggs which he seetheth, and then
trafficketh away: that which he himself told me, was indeed incredible. But
this one thing which reflects nearer upon our discourse, seems to me
remarkable in chief, and does give a clear testimony of the excessive
multitude: which is, that this Island as you approach it, shines with a white
glasing, and the clifts resemble mountains of the purest Chalk, though the
native complexion of the Stone be obscure and black. That which thus
discoloureth the Island, is a white crust, which is friable, and of the very
same Consistence, Complexion, and Nature with the Egge-shell; so that all parts
of the Island are plaistered over with this hard tegument, and crumbling or
friable crust or shale. The bottom of the Island which the Tide washes every
day, retaining still its natural color, clearly shows that that fucus, or
sophisticated whiteness, proceeds from the liquid Excrements of the Birds
(which they discharge when they disburden their Belies) and by which, as it
were with an Egge-shell, white, hard and friable, the Walls are crusted and
disguised: And after the same manner, do Aristotle and Pliny consent, that the
Egge-shell is formed. None of these Birds are Citizens of the place, but
Foreigners all, and resort thither for convenient Laying, and there they
continue some weeks as in their Inn; till they and their Young-ones be all in
condition to fly away together. But that white Ruff-cast is so solid, firm,
and thick, that you would think it were the genuine and natural substance of
the soil.

This liquid, white, and bright Excrement, does glide with the Urine from the
kidneys of the Birds through the Ureters, into the common cavity or Jakes, and
there covering over the excrements of the guts, passes forth together with
them, and it is a thicker part of their Urine, then that which we call the
Sediment or Hypostasis in ours. We have spoken something of this matter before,
and we have demonstrated it fuller elsewhere.

Store of this white excrement is there chiefly to be seen, where the Hawks
defile the walls that do neighbor their pertches with their ejections, which
they be-dawb with a glewy white, and distinguish as it were with a Ceruse.

I have found as much of this slimey cement in the repository of a dead
Ostrich, as would fill ones hand: so also in a Land-Tortoise, and several other
Four-footed creatures, that are Oviparous, this white plaistering-stuff does
abound; and being disloaded, the thinner parts evaporating, it does soon
congeale either into a friable crusly substance, or into a dust or powder,
resembling the egg-shell, pounded in a Mortar.

Amongst the so many several kinds of Birds (which make their conflux to the
aforesaid Island for Procreation sake) and so many several structures of their
nests, wherein they hatch their young, there was one Bird showed me above all
the rest, which lays one only egg, fixing it upon the steep point of a
sharp stone, (having neither nest, not any other materials to support it) and
that so secure, and firmly, that the mother-bird can leave it there, and return
again to it at pleasure, without any prejudice to the egg at all. But if this
egg be once removed from its station, no art nor cunning in the world can
fasten it again, but it instantly falls into the sea, as from a precipite,
without redemption. The reason is, because the place where it is mounted, is
incrustated all over with the white cement; and the egg being newly laid,
wreaketh with a stiff and viscous humidity, which presently congealing, it is
agglutinated to the subjacent stone, as it were with a kind of soulder.

An example of so nimble a concretion as this, we may see at the Statuaries,
who out of calcined Alabaster, or certain mortar tempered with water, do make
a liquid cement; which being artificially applied, will take off the figure of
the countenance of a dead man, or the shape and resemblance of any thing
whatsoever, be it never so little; and so that growing hard, remains for a
Mould.

As therefore in almost all liquors there is some earthy consistence, (as in
Wine, there is the Tariar; in Water, mudde or sand; in Lie, salt; which when
the greater part of the moisture is exhaled, does subside, and congeal at the
bottom) so is there a white sediment, descending with the urine from the Birds
kidneys into the common Jakes, with which I did conceive the egg was there
incrustated, and plaistered over; as the pavements are by Hawks, and the clifts
of the foresaid Island by the numerous conflux of Birds and Foul: And thus
Chamber-pots, and places where people urine much, use to be over-cast with a
yellow crust, from the concrescence of that substance, which creates stones in
the kidneys and bladder, and other parts of the Body. I did, I say, conceive
(especially being induced thereto by the authority of Aristotle and Pliny) that
out of this white hypostasis, which does much abound in all Oviparous
creatures, (whose eggs are encompassed by a hard shell) the fabric of the
Henns egg-shell was erected, and congealed (upon exclusion) by the cold ambient
air. And this opinion is so rooted in me by many other experiments, that I can
hardly forbear to believe, that some part of the shell at lest, is produced
from thence.

But (as Fabricius rightly advises) let reason be silent, where experience
warranteth the contrary; for it is too much the crime of the age we live in, to
obtrude opinions built upon conjecture, and slender reasoning, as infallible
truths (without any testimony at all from sense.)

For I am certainly assured from Experiment, that the egg (at lest here in
England) is adorned with its shell, while it has its abode in the Womb, though
Aristotle and Pliny affirm the contrary, and Fabricius also is not very
obstinate in the negative. Perchance indeed in hotter countries, where the
hens are of a stronger constitution, the eggs are commonly laid soft, and
without shells, but that is very rare amongst us. So when I was at Venice,
Aromatarius, a famous Physician, showed me a small leaf formed between the two
shales of a Pease cod, though with us in the like case there is only a small
knob of the future pulse to be seen. So much does the indulgent temper and
clemency of the Heavens, Soil, and Air, conduce to the fecundity, and happy
increase of things.

Of the rest of the parts of the Egg.
EXERCIT. XII.
WHere, how, and when the rest of the parts of the egg are generated, we have
partly declared already in the history of the Womb; and shall partly mention
hereafter, when we come to treat of their Use.

The White (says Fabricius) is by Pliny called page 22. The White.
Ovi albus liquor; by Celsus, Ovi candidum; by Paladius, Ovi Albor; by Apicius,
Ovi album, and albamentum; in Greek, (...); by Aristotle, (...); by Anaxagoras,
(...), Lac avium, the Milk of the Bird. And it is the cold, stiff, white
liquor of the egg, of different thickness, (for at the obtuse and acute end of
the egg it is more fluid, but more crass in other parts) and quantity (for it
is in more abundance at the blunt end of the egg, and less at the sharp, and
yet still less in the other parts) embracing the yolke round about.

But I have ever observed in a Hens egg, not only a difference in the same
White, but two distinct Whites in the same egg, and both of them involved in a
peculiar membrane of their own: One of which is more thin and fluid, and almost
of the same consistence with that humor which we have said to flow in the folds
of the Uterus, and to constitute and nourish the White. The other White is more
thick and viscous, and dyed of a deeper whitecolour then the other; which in
stale, and such eggs as the Hen sits on, after some days of her Incubation,
waxes yellowish; and as this thicker White does immediately surround the yolk,
so does the liquid White encompass this. Now, that these two whites are really
distinct, will soon appear, if after you have broken and removed the shell, you
^^ick the two membranes which come next to ^ind; for then presently this liquid
and exterior White will run about, and the two membranes sink to the bottom
of the basin: but the grosser White will all the while keep within its own
bounds, and globous figure, as being terminated with its own proper membrane,
which yet is so subtle and slender, that your eye cannot perceive it; but if
you cut it cross the White, it will presently stream out, and lose its round
figure: as when a bladder is divided, the moisture contained therein is set at
liberty; and so also if you make a breach upon the proper containing-coat of
the yolke, the saffron-coloured juice will issue out, and its former globosity
be destroyed.

The Yolke (says Fabricius) is called in Latin Vitellus, from Vita, Life;
because the chicken lives The Yolk. page 23.
upon it: It is also called from its color Ovi Luteum, the yellow of the Egg;
in Greek, (...); by Hippocrates, (...); by Aristotle, (...), and (...); ^^e
Ancients (as Suidas out of Menander) (...)* that is, the pullus, or chicken;
because they conceived the chicken was bred of that part. It is the softest
juice that is in all the egg, and confined within a most thin membrane, which
being broken, it presently glideth forth, and is then inconstant to any figure:
it is treasured up in the middle of the egg, being sometimes yellow, and
sometimes of a mixed complexion, betwixt yellow and pallid; it is exactly
circular, and of diverse magnitude, according to the diversity of the magnitude
of the Fowls themselves; for Water-fowle have a larger yolke, and Land-fowle a
larger White, says Aristotle. According to whom also, The yolk Hist. an. l. 6.
c. 2.
and White are of a contrary nature, not in color only but power; for the yolk
is condensed by cold, which cold does not condense the white, but dissolve it.
And so on the contrary, the white is condensed by fire, but the yolk is not
condensed thereby, but remains soft unless the egg be over-rosted; being
more dried and hardened by being boiled then roasted. And as in the greater
world, the earth is deposited in the Center the Air and the Water being round
about it, so also the yolk, as the more earthy part, is incircled by the two
whites, whereof the one is grosser, the other finer. Nay (Aristotle adds
further) if any man beat many eggs together in a basin, and boil Hist. an. l.
6. c. 2. de genesis an. l. 3. c. 1.
them with a soft and gentle fire, the yolks will in their entire mass gather
themselves orbicularly into the midst, and the whites surround them. Yet
Physicians generally do decree the White to be the colder part. But of that
more hereafter.

The Chalazae, that is, the Hailstones, or little pearls or specks, like Hail
(which the Italians call The Chalazae.
Galladura, and we the Treddle) are two in every egg; one seated in the
obtuse, the other in the Acute Angle of the egg. The major part of both which
is found in the white, but yet they adhere closer to the yolke, and are annexed
to its membrane. They are something oblong bodies, more congealed, and whiter
then the white it self, knotly, and in some sort transparent, as Hail is, from
whence they borrow their compellation: for every Chalaza contains several
hailstones as it were, glewed to one another by the white. One of these
Chalazae is larger then his fellow, and more distant from the yolke, toward
the blunt end of the egg; the other smaller, and tends from the yolke to the
sharp end of the egg. The larger of these two is made up of three knotty
substances, like haile-stones, or seed-pearles, which are placed a small space
one from the other, the lesser lying behind the greater.

In all eggs of all Birds whatsoever, whether they be fertile, or addle, these
chalazae are to be found, and that in each end, one; whence the fond persuasion
of old Wives, that the chalazae are the Cocks seed, and the subject matter out
of which the chicken is procreated, lies waste, and overturned. And yet
Fabricius himself, though he absolutely deny that they are made of the seed of
the Cock, yet he labors with many arguments, to prove, page 48.
that they are that immediate matter, which the Cock endoweth with fecundity,
and out of which the fabric of the chicken is erected: which he endeavors
to evince by this frail ground, that (forsooth) in an page 57.
egg when its boiled, the chalazae are in such sort contracted and shrunk up,
as that they represent a conception, or chicken shaped, and hatched. But how
improbable a thing is it, that every egg should have two seeds or rudiments,
for the constitution of one only chicken, when no man living ever yet beheld
any foundation or progress of a chicken, but only in the blunt angle of the
egg? And moreover, there is no sensible difference at all between the chalazae
of those eggs which coition has made fruitful, and those which are altogether
barren. But this worthy man was mistaken in the intent of the chalazae, which
shall appear more clearly hereafter.

In the eggs of the least Birds of all, you may track these chalazae, which
appear there like a fine thread, or slender nerve. But in the two ends of the
eggs of the Ostrich and Cassoware, I have seen exceeding thick, long, and white
chalazae, consisting of many little globous bodies, of different dimension.

In the blunter end of the egg, near the shell in The Cavity.
the inside, you may discover a little small cavity, or hollowness; which is
sometimes exactly at the top of all, and sometimes inclining to one side,
almost directly opposite to the Chalaza which is at the other end: the figure
of it is most commonly circular, but in a goose or duck-egge it is not so
precisely round. This cavity you may plainly see, appearing like a cloudy spot,
if at night you hold an egg against a candle in one hand, and lay the other
hand transversly upon the obtuse angle of the egg.

In a new-layed egg it is but little, seeming in magnitude of the bigness of
the ball of a man's eye; but it increases daily, according as the egg grows
staler, and the weather hotter.

After one days incubation, it spreads mainly, as if some thinner part of
the white, which lies uppermost, were exhaled, and the rest contracted, and so
the space grown wider. For this cavity resideth between the shell, (which in
that place has no membrane to line it) and that outward membrane which
contains all the liquidities of the egg. All eggs whatever have it, nay, I
have found it in the eggs which remain as yet in the Uterus of the Hen, so
soon as ever they assume a shell. Some that pretend to cunning in this matter,
will prognosticate, that if this cavity be directly in the top of the egg, the
chicken then will be a cock, but if it deflect to the side, it will be a
hen. But this is most certain, if the cavity be very small, it signifies the
egg is new-layed, but if it be any thing large, a stale one. But more largely
of this hereafter.

There is a very small white circle embracing the The Cicatrice.
coat of the yolke (in fashion of a small Cicatrice) which Fabricius therefore
calls Cicatricula; but he sets little by it, counting it rather a blemish,
then a part of the egg. This is a very little spot, about the bigness of a
small Lentile, like the ball of a Birds eye, being white, flat, and round. And
all eggs have this too, even from their very first original in the yolk. And
therefore Fabricius is deceived, while he fancieth this spot to be nothing but
a relic of the stalk broken off from the yolk; by which it was incorporated
to the cluster in the Ovary. For the Pedunculus or stalk (as himself
acknowledges) is hollow, and as it approaches nearer to the yolk, it dilateth
it self, that it may encompass it round, and shut it up as in a little bag or
purse; for it is not fastened into the middle of the yolk (as the stalks of
Apples, and other Fruits are) that so it should leave a relic behind it,
when it falls off. Now if sometimes in a very fair yolk (as Fabricius
reports) you chance to find a double Cicatrice, it may probably occasion a
Monster, or Twins, (as shall be discoursed hereafter) but does no way import
a double stalk. But he is extremely overseen, in thinking this Cicatrice to be
utterly useless: for it is the most material, concerned part in the whole egg,
for whose sake all the rest of the parts are created, and the original and
foundation out of which the Chicken it self is formed. And Parisanus does
falsely contend, that this is the Cocks seed.

Of the difference of Eggs.
EXERCIT. XIII.
THere is a twofold acceptance of the word Egg; proper, or improper. An egg
in its proper Acceptance is that thing, to which Aristotle's definition Hist.
an. l. 1. c. 5.
of an egg does square: An egg is that thing, one part of which does
constitute an Animal, and the rest does nourish it, when it is constituted. In
its improper acceptance, it is that to which Aristotle's definition de genesis an.
l. 1. c. 2.
about the same place is proportioned. An Egg is that thing out of which the
whole Animal is constituted. And of this kind are the eggs of Ants, Flies,
Spiders, some kind of Butterflies, and many other very small eggs of that
kind: which Aristotle does almost every where scruple to call by the name of
eggs, but styles them little worms. Thus far Fabricins; but we (whose design
is chiefly to treat of the page 19.
generation of Hen-eggs) have no intention to deliver the several distinctions
of all sorts of Eggs, but only to lay down the diversities of Hen-eggs. Of
Hen-eggs therefore, some are new-laid, and some staler, the former are whiter
then the later; for The distinction and difference of Eggs from their Age.
time does clowd them, and especially incubation. The New-laid also have a very
small hollowness or cavity in the obtuse angle; and if they be very new indeed,
they are something rough with a dust or powder that sticks to their sides;
but those that are stale, as their complexion is darker, so their shell is
smoother. New-layed eggs (if they be whole) being put near the fire will sweat,
and are of much pleasanter taste, and more esteemed of, then other. And eggs
after two or three days incubation, are even then sweeter relished then stale
ones are: as if the cherishing warmness of the Hen, did refresh and restore
them to their primitive excellence and integrity. And after full fourteen days
(when the Chicken now begins to be downey, and extends his dominion over
half the egg, and the jolke is almost still entire) I have boiled an egg till
it was hard, that so I might discern the position of the chicken more
distinctly, which was limned out in the white of the egg, as if the chicken
had been cast in a Mould: and yet the yolke was as sweet and pleasant as that
of a new-laid egg, when it is in like manner boiled to an induration. The
yolke of an egg taken out of a live Hen, and presently eaten, tastes much
sweeter raw, then dressed.

Eggs are likewise distinguishable from their figure; From their Figure. Hist.
an. l. 6. c. 2. l. 10. c. 52. lib. 9. de Rust. c. 5.
for some are longer, and sharper then others. Out of these oblong and acute
eggs (according to Aristotle) are hens begotten, and of the blunt, cocks. But
Pliny says the contrary; The rounder sort of eggs (says he) breed Hens, the
other, Cocks. And Columella is of his mind too: If one would have good store
of Cocks (quoth he) let him place the longest and sharpest eggs under his Hen;
and if the contrary, let him provide the roundest he can get for money.
Aristotle's Scaliger upon the place.
opinion is grounded upon this reason; namely, because the Rounder are the
hotter; for it is the custom and condition of heat, to congregate, and fix; and
that heat is most powerful, that ^^ most operative. And therefore from the
stronger, and perfecter principle, the stronger and perfecter Animal does
arise. Now such is the Male in respect of the Female (especially the Cock being
compared to the Hen.) And now on the other side, the lesser sort of eggs are
reputed imperfect, and the least sort of all, utterly improlifical. And
therefore Aristotle, to procure a constant race of eggs of a fair size,
recommendeth the frequent coition of cock and hen; for he concludes the barren
and subvontuneous eggs to be all of the lesser sort, and more insipid; and
that because they are moister and imperfecter then others. Now this distinction
of eggs here spoken of, is to be understood of the eggs of one and the same
hen (for should a hen lay eggs always of the same dimensions, she would
always hatch them all cocks, or all hens) because if you take it otherwise,
the conjecture of which will be a cock or a hen, raised from the signs
above mentioned, will be very dubions. For several henns, lay eggs of a several
shape, and magnitude: for some lay oblong, some rounder, and little differing
the one from the other. For though I have sometimes found a difference in the
eggs laid by the same henn, yet the distinction is so exceeding small, that
unless a man be very well versed, he will not perceive it. For since all the
eggs of the same hen, are cast and modelled in the same womb (as in a Mould)
they are all impressed with, near upon, the same figure: and therefore it
cannot be avoided, but that they should much resemble one another (as those
excrements that are figured in the same complications of the same Colon)
insomuch that I my self have with case in a little basket of eggs sorted every
hens eggs by themselves. And who ever practices it, shall be nimble at it.
Certainly it is worth our wonder which daily experience declares in Keepers.
The more diligent sort of Keepers of Parks, that have the charge of several
herds of Deer, will tell you punctually which and which are the Horns of such
and such Dear, as often as they ca^ their Heads. A silly, ignorant Shepherd,
who had the care of a great flock of sheep, grew so well acquainted with every
particular sheep, that if any one were missing (though he had not arithmetic
enough to count them) he could punctually tell which it was, of whom it was
bought, and whence it came. And once, to make trial of him, his Master
commanded him, out of forty lambs which he penned up in a Fould on purpose, to
single out the particular lamb of such an Ewe, which he did exactly, and
carried to the Damme. I know some Huntsmen, that if they have once seen a Deer,
or the horns of a Deer, or footsteps only in soft ground, are able to know the
same Deer again from all the Herd besides, even by those very horns, or tread:
(just as the Lion is distinguished by his Pew) nay having merely seen the print
of the Deers hoof, they will exactly resolve, how large the Deer is, how fat,
and how swift: as whether he be well in breath, or over-hunted; and also,
whether a Buck or a Do. And more then this, there are some, who when forty
Dogs are pursuing the Chase, and are in full Cry, will distinguish them all,
(though a great way off) and will by their ^^^ inform you, which Dog is first,
and which behind; which hunteth upon the sent, and which is at a loss; whether
the Deer be still in flight, or ^^ a Bay, and disputing the conquest with his
horns; whether he have stood long, or be newly rowsed. And all this in the very
midst of the dogs, hunters, and windings of the horns, even in a woody Park,
and where they were never in their lives before. We are not therefore to wonder
so much, if those ^^^t practice it, can discover which Egg belongs to which
Hen: I would we could as easily judge which Son belongs to which Father.

But the chief difference of Eggs consists in this, that some are fruitful,
and some addle, which From their Fecundity.
are called Ova improlifica, irrita, Hypenemia, or subventanea, and Zephyria.
They are called Hypenemia, which being laid by the Hen without conference had
with the Cock, are therefore of no use to the generation of Chickens, being
styled hypenemia, quasi a vento prognata forent, as if they were begotten by
the wind: as Varro says, that Mares in Spain conceive by the Wind. For the
de Re rust. c. 1.
West wind is exceeding fruitful, and thence the name Zephyrus, quasi (...),
enlivening; for so Virgil:

-- Zephyrique tepentibus auris
Laxant arva sinus, superat tener omnibus burner,
Parturit omnis ager, etc.
-- And when warm Zephyrus blows,
The fields dissolve, soft moisture overflows,
And every Pasture grows.
And therefore the people of old, seeing their Hens in the Springtime lay,
this wind then blowing, did conceive Zephyrus to be the Author of the
generation of those eggs. Eggs are likewise Urine, and Cynosura (when the Hen
will sit no longer upon them) so called, because eggs grow often addle in the
Dog-dayes, for the hen deserteth them by reason of the extreme Heat; or else
because about that time of the year, it thundered often: for Aristotle says,
that Eggs rot, if at the Hist an. l. 6. c. 2. Pliny lib. 10. c. 54.
time of the Hens incubation it chance to thunders Those eggs are esteemed
foecunda, fruitful, which (if there be no outward impediment) by a quickening
heat will generate chickens; which may be effected not only by the incubation
of the Hen^ whose eggs they are, but of any other Foul of competent magnitude
to cherish and cover them, or by any other cherishing warmth whatsoever.

For Aristotle says, That chickens are as well hatched upon the ground of
their own accord, as by the Ibid.
birds incubation: As in Egypt they cover the eggs with dung. And the Story
goes, That a good fellow of Syracusa sat so long upon a mat under the which
eggs were laid, that ere he had done tippling the chickens were hatched. The
Emperesse Livia is also reported to have cherished an egg so long in her
bosom, till the chicken was bred. And to this day in Egypt, and other parts,
chickens are hatched by stoves and ovens. An egg therefore (as Fabricius truly
affirms) is not only the Uterus, and place page 19.
of residence of the chicken, but the matter also on which the whole generation
of the foetus does depend: which generation the egg does perform and
accomplish, both as Agent, Matter, Instrument, Place, and ever other Requisite
whatsoever. For certain it is, that the chicken is constituted by an internal
principle in the egg, and that there is no accession to a complete and perfect
egg, by the Hens incubation, but bare cherishing and protection: no more
then the Hen contributeth to the chickens which are now hatched, which is only
a friendly heat, and care, by which she defends them from the cold, and
foreign injuries, and helps them to their meat. And therefore the Incubation
of the Hen is required, that she may upon that relation undertake the
education of the chicken, instruct and direct their walks, prepare and look for
their feeding, and by the comfort of her wings cherish them. And all these
things will not be so well performed by any but her. We have indeed Capons, and
mungrel-fowle, such as are the issue of a Pheasant-cock and a Dunghill-henne,
which will sit upon the eggs, and hatch them too, but they have no dexterity
to guide the chickens, or manage the charge of their education.

I can here but admire (intending to treat larger hereafter of the same matter)
with what constancy and patience, almost all female Birds will out-sit whole
nights and days, and impare their healths, and almost famish themselves; and
to what hazards they expose themselves in defense of their eggs, which, if
upon necessary occasion they are at any time constrained to leave, oh! how
earnestly, and with what dispatch do they hasten their return! Ducks, and
Geese, for the time of their absence, cover their eggs with straw. And with
what undaunted resolution will these feeble parents many times combat in right
of their eggs, which perhaps are subventaneous or addle, nay sometimes
artificial of-springs, the issues of chalk or ivory, whose injuries yet they
will revenge with the same magnanimity, with those done to their legitimate
productions? Indeed the Birds affection toward the dull, liveless egg, is
exceeding wonderful, which is altogether incapable of making any return of
friendship or respect. Who can forbear to be amazed at the affection, or
frenzy rather of a Hen that is glocking, or ready to sit^ which nothing can
extinguish, but a deluge of cold water; for so long as this rage is upon her,
(...) grows quite careless, and walks like a bed him, with her wings
trailed, and feathers rough, and advanced, and she her self mournful, and
restless: ^^ she meet with any Hen sitting, she will depose^ her, having all
her thoughts bent upon eggs and incubation; nor will she desist, till she
either (...) eggs to sit upon, or chickens to discipline: which then she does
assemble, nurture, feed, and protect with admirable zeal. Who can refrain
smiling, to see a Hen follow young Ducklins, and having hatched up that
supposititious brood (apprehending them to be her own) pursue them when they
are now swimming in the Pond, while she her self circuites about the brimmes,
and many times attempts to sail after to the hazard of drowning, still calling,
and enticeing them back, as if they had mistaken themselves.

Aristotle gives this reason why steril eggs produce Hist. an. l. 6. c. 2.
no chickens, namely, because the juices contained in them receive no
thickening by incubation, neither does their yolk or white recede any thing
from the nature they were of before. But of this we shall discourse hereafter,
in our general contemplation of Generation.

Our women, that they may distinguish between eggs that have chickens in them,
and eggs that are barren and addle, after the fourteenth or sixteenth day from
the Hens first sitting, do gently drop the eggs into warm water, and those
that sink to the bottom they account barren, but those that swim, fertile. And
if the chicken in the egg be of any considerable growth, and bestirre himself
lustily, the egg will not only tumble up and down, but leap and caper. And if
you listen close for some days before exclusion, you may perceive the
chickens, kick, make a noise, and cry after their manner. Which kind of
Commotions when the Sitting Hen discovers in her nest, she removes the
eggs, and rowleth them to and fro, (as careful mothers do their disquiet and
peevish infants in the craedle) till the chickens being accommodated with
convenient posture, lie hushed, and still.

Hen-eggs are likewise distinguished from their From Number.
Number. For some Hens (says the Philosopher) lay Hist. an. l. 6. c. 1.
all the year long, bating only the two Winter months. Some gallant Hens will
bring sixty eggs before the Suting time; yet these are not so fruitful as the
ordinary sort of Hens. The Adrian Hens are small, but lay every day; yet they
are very testy, and many times (...) their chickens; and their feathers are of
change (...) colors. Some domestic Hens will lay twice a day and the
fecundity of some, shorteneth their days.

Some Hens in England lay every day; but the ordinary fertile race, for the
most part, lay for two days together; namely, the first egg in the morning,
the second in the evening following, and the third is a day of vacancy. Some
Hens have an unlucky custom to break their eggs, and leave their nests; but
whether this be their disease, or vice, is yet unresolved.

There are differences also taken from Incubation; for some Hens sit once,
some twice, others thrice, Incubation.
and some oftener. Florentinus writes, that certain Hens, Natives of that
Alexandria which is in Egypt, called Monosirae, of whom springs a race of
Game-cocks, do sit two or three times, having the chickens which they have
newly hatched taken from them, and brought up apart. By which mean it comes to
pass, that one Hen will hatch forty, sixty, and sometimes more chickens at one
sitting.

Some Eggs also are of a large, some of a less, and Magnitude.
some of the least size of all; and these last are commonly called in Italy,
Centenina; and our Women, to this day, (as of old also) belly them to be
Cocks-eggs, and that they produce Basilisks. The Common people (says
Fabricius) think this small egg to be the Hens concluding production, after
she has laid at page 10.
hundred eggs (from whence it is called Centeninum, the Hundredth egg) which
has no yolk at all; yet has all the other parts, as the Chalazae, the White,
the Membranes, and the Shell. For it is likely that this is then laid, when
all the yolks are already completed into Eggs, and there is no more remaining,
yolks the Vitellary, that may become eggs; but yet on the other side, there is
still some little White behind, and ^^ of that Modicum of White it is probable
this little Egg is framed. But this seems not probable to (...); because it
is an assured truth, that when the Ovary is exhausted, the Second Uterus also
(as himself confesses) is also spent, and wasted into a ^eer membrane, not
containing any residue of the White, or Moisture at all. Fabricius goes on:
There i^ sound a twofold Ovum Centeninum, one without a yolk, (and this is
properly called Centeninum) which is the last the hen lays, with which the
hen, concludes her Laying for that season: the other also is a very small
egg, but has a yolke, and is not the concluding, but some intervenient egg,
after which the hen does persist to lay eggs of a just magnitude, as before;
but it fails in its dimensions, by reason of some impair in the vegetal
faculty, as it happens to Peaches, and other Fruits, whereof some are of a
full growth, and others exceeding small. He might have accused for this
mischance, the inclemency of the Air, and Soil, also the penury, and pravity
of the nourishment. But, that the last Eggs are always very little, I cannot
willingly consent.

Nor are even Eggs without their Monsters. For Aldrovand. Ornithol. l. 14.
page 260
the Augurs (says Aristotle) did account it Ominous, when Eggs were laid that
were all yolke; or when such eggs were found in the hen, she being cut up,
under the Septum Transversum, and they of the magnitude of a Perfect Egg.

And hither may be referred Ova Gemellifica, Twinne-eggs, which are furnished
with two yolks; such as I lately found in the Uterus of a hen, i^ being
complete, and guarded with a Shell, having Yolks, Cicatrices, and the grosser
Whites, all doubles it had also four Chalazae; but, as for the White of thinner
consistence, there was only One, which did encompass all the rest: it had also
two only common investing Membranes, and one single Shell. For though
Aristotle affirm, that some hens always produce such Eggs; yet, that it so
happens by the course of nature, I can hardly believe. And though two
chickens may be hatched out of such Eggs, (which I have experimented, contrary
to Fabricius his persuasion, who says, that of such all eg, the chicken
hatched will have four legs, two heads, and four wings; of which hereafter) yet
they are not vital, but commonly dye soon, and that either for defect of Air,
or room in the Shell, or that one is an impediment to the other, and does
violence to it; for it cannot be, that both should be equally ready and ripe
for Exclusion, and that one should not prove an Abortion.

To sum up all: The Differences of Eggs are chiefly of three kinds: For some
are Fertile, and some Addle; some produce Cocks, and some Hens; some spring
from Parents of the same species, and some from Parents of a diverse species,
and so bring mungril-chickens; such as are conceived from a Dunghill-hen, and a
Cock-Pheasant, and so resemble either the Cock that obtained the first, or last
Coition.

For, according to Aristotle, the egg which is constituted by Coition, passes
from its own kind into another, Hist. an. l. 6. c. 2.
in case the hen proceed to Coition, (having either a barren egg in her, or
else an egg conceive by the semen of cocks of different kind) before the yolk
have procured its white. And thus are barren egg fructified, and fruitful eggs
entertain the form of that ^ocke, who had the last courtesy in Coition. But if
the White be already obtained, it cannot be, that either barren eggs should be
altered into fruitful; or that those eggs which are already conceived by
Coition, should pass into the kind of that cock who was last entertained. For
the Cocks semen is (as Scaliger sharply observes) like A Testament, where the
last will In loc.
is that which takes place.

To these differences may be perhaps added, that, whereby some Eggs are strong,
veget, and (if we may so say) courageous; for as there is a soul in Eggs, so
have they likewise a competent virtue. For as in other sorts of Animals, some
Females are so libidinous and full of venery, that they take like Tinder, from
one single act of Coition (be it never so feeble, and the male never so
impotent) and conceive forthwith, and bring diverse foetuses by that one act:
others again are so dull and sluggish, that unless they be provided with a more
generous male, and him also highly inflamed (and the coition likewise repeated
and continued) they will remain unsuccessfull. The same also befalls in Eggs,
whereof some, though conceived by coition, are improlifical, unless they be
empowered by repeated, and continued coition.

Hence it comes to pass, that some eggs are quickly altered, and after three
days of Incubation discover some rudiments of a foetus: but others are either
easily corrupted, or are slow in their progress toward chickens, and yield no
expectation of a chicken, even at the seventh day: As shall be hereafter
proved, in the discourse of the Generation of the Pulbus, or Chicken out of the
Egg.

And thus far of the Womb of the Hen, and its Office: as also of the
Generation of the Hen-egge, its differences, and accidents: wherein we have
delivered what we have experimented our selves; by which you may give judgment
of other Oviprous creatures.

It now remains that we should prosecute (...) history, of the Generation,
and Formation of the Foetus out of the Egg. For (as I informed you before) the
whole Contemplation of the brood of H^^ and Cocks is comprehended in these two
things namely, how the Egg is produced of the Hen and Cock, and how the
Cock and Hen are framed out of an Egg: and by this circle the propagation of
their Race may by the benefit and favor of Nature, be prolonged, and continued.

Of the generation of the Foetus out of a Hen-egge.
EXERCIT. XIV.
We have already discovered the Formation, and Generation of the Egg; it
remains that we now deliver our Observations, concerning the Procreation of the
Chicken out of the Egg. An undertaking equally difficult, useful, and
pleasant as the former. For Natures Rudiments and Attempts are involved in
obscurity and deep night, and so perplexed with subtilties, that they delude the
most piercing wit, as well as the sharpest eye.

Nor can we easier discover the secret recesses, and dark principles of
Generation, then the method of the fabric and Composure of the which world. In
this reciprocal interchange of Generation and Corruption consists the Aeternity
and Dura^^ of mortal creatures. And as the Rising and ^etting of the Sun, does
by continued revolutions complete and perfect Time: so does the alternate
vicissitude of Individuums, by a constant repetition of the same species,
perpetuate the continuance of ^ading things.

Those Authors which have delivered any thing touching this subject, do for the
most part tread a several Path: for having their Judgments prepossessed with
their own private opinions, they proceed to erect and fashion principles
proportionable to them.

Aristotle of old, and Hieronymus Fabricius of late, Hist. an. l. 6. c. 3.
have written so accurately concerning the Formation and Generation of the
Foetus out of the Egg, that they seem to have left little to the industry of
Posterity. And yet Ulysses Aldrovandus has undertaken Ornithol. l. 14.
the description of the Pullulation or formation of the Chicken out of the
Egg, out of his own Observations: wherein he seems rather to have directed and
guided his thoughts by the Authority of Aristotle, then his own Experience.

For Volcherus Coiter, living at Bononia at the same time, did by the advice of
the said Aldrovandus (whom he calls Tutor) daily employ himself in the opening
of Eggs then sat upon by the Hen, and has discovered many things truer then
Aldrovandus Nobil. exer. l. 6.
himself, of which he also could not be ignorant. Likewise Aemilius Parisanus
(a Venetian Doctor) despising other men's opinions, has fancted A new
procreation of the Chicken out of the Egg.

But because somethings, (according to our experience) and those of great
moment and consequence, are much otherwise, then has been y^^ delivered, I
shall declare to you what daily progress is made in the egg, and what parts
are alt^^ed, especially about the first days of Incubation at which time all
things are most intricate, confused, and hard to observe, and about which
Authors do chiefly stickle for their own observation, which they accommodate
rather to their own (...) conceived persuasions (which they have entertained
concerning the Material and Efficient causes of the generation of Animals) then
to truth her self.

What Aristotle relates concerning the Pr^c^^tion of the Chicken, is most true
in it self; yet li^^ one who had not experimented the matters him self, but
had received them from other experienced persons, he does not rightly
distinguish them by their proper times: and is very much mistaken concerning
the place in which the first principle of the Chicken is cast, which he decrees
to be in the Acute Angle of the Egg, and is therefore justly reprehended by
Fabricius. Nor does he seem to have observed the beginning of the Pullus in the
egg, or to have been able to have found those things there, which he accounts
necessary to every Generation. For he would have the White (because nothing can
possibly be made of nothing, according to the natural course) to be the Matter
constitution the Chicken. Nor did he sufficiently apprehend how the Efficient
cause (namely the Cocks seed) ^^ act without a contact; or how the Egg could
of its own accord, without any inherent geniture of the Male, engender the
Foetus.

Aldrovandus, partaking of the same error with Aristotle, says moreover,
(which none but a blind man can subscribe to) that the Yolk does in the first
days, arise to the Acute Angle of the Egg: and tinks the Grandines to be the
Seed of the Cock; and that the Pullus is framed out of them, but nourished as
well by the Yolk as the White: which is clean contrary to Aristotle's opinion,
who conceived the Grandines to conduce nothing to the fecundity of the Egg.

Volcherus Coiter delivers truer things, and more consonant to Autopsie, yet
his three Globuli are mere fables. Nor did he rightly consider the principle,
from whence the Foetus is derived in the Egg.

Hieronymus Fabricius indeed contends, that the Grandines are not the Seed of
the Cock: and yet he ^ill have the body of the Chicken to be framed out of
them. (as out of its first matter) being made fruitful by the Seed of the
Cock. He likewise saw the Original of the Chicken in the Egg; namely the
Macula, or Cicatricula annexed to the membrane of the Yolke, but conceived it
to be only a Relic of the stalk broken off, and an infirmity or blemish
only of the Egg, and not a Principle part of it.

Parisanus has plentifully confuted Fabricius his opinion concerning the
Chalazae or Grandines, and yet himself is evidently at a loss in some certain
circles and points of the Principle parts of the Foetus (namely the Liver and
the Heart:) and seems to have observed a Principium, or first Principle of the
Foetus, but not to have known which it was, ^^ that he says, That the Punctum
Album in the Middle of the Circles is the Cocks Seed, out of which the Chicken
is made.

So that it comes to pass, that while each of them desire to reduce the manner
of the Formation of the Chicken out of the Egg, to their own pre-conceived
opinions, they are all wide from the mark.

For some conceive the Seed and Blood to be the Matter which does constitute
the Chicken: Others conceive the Seed to be the Efficient and producing cause,
or Artificer that builds the fabric of it: wh^^ yet upon deliberate
consideration it appears most infallible, that there is no matter at hand at
all, (...) no menstruous blood, which the Seed of the Male can fall to work
upon, or coagulate: (as Aristotle would have it) nor is the Foetus made of the
Seed of Male or Female, or any commixture of them both.

The first Inspection of the Egg, what the first day of Incubation does
produce in the Egg.
EXERCIT. XV.
THat we may the better discover what the first day of incubation has produced
in the Egg we must first know what alterations will befall o^ eggs of their
own accord; by which a stale egg is distinguished from a fresh, (without any
consideration of the Hens sitting at all) that so it may appear, what is
wrought by the very incubation it self. There is therefore (as we have
declared before) in all eggs, a certain cavity or hollow i^ the blunt end of
the egg; which cavity as the egg grows staler, increases accordingly:
especially in hot Countries and seasons (by reason the exhalation of a thinner
part of the white:) we have spoken in the History of the egg. An^ while that
cavity does exspatiate, it enlarges mo^^ according to the longitude, then
latitude of the Egg, and obtains a figure at last which does re^^^e from
being orbicular.

The Egg-shell being now less transparent, growth cloudy.

The White grows thicker, and more viscous, ^ding toward a duskey or
Straw-colour.

The Proper membrane or coat of the Yolke becomes more remiss and loose,
shrinking up into winckles.

The Chalazae continue still the same place, site, and consistence, at each end
of the egg (and that not in new-layed eggs only, but stale ones; nor ^^
those alone that are conceived after coition, but wind-eggs also;) by whose
firm connection, the Yolk and White are so fast cemented together, that both
retain their proper position. For these are two abiliments mutually opposed, or
the Poles and ^^inges of this Microcosme: so composed, as if they were only a
conflux of the numerous coats of the White, and were wound as it were into a
knotty ^^rd, at both ends where they respect the yolk. And hence it comes to
pass, that the yolk is not easily ^^ted from the company of the White, except
the Chalazae be first divided: which done, they presently dis-join. And by the
assistance of these hin^es, the yolk is both fixed in the center, and preser^ed
in its right consistence. So that the chief part ^f all, namely the
Cicatricula, retains still the (...) region or altitude in the Egg, and
continues a middle space from both the extremities. For ^is Spot, or
Cicatrice, as well in a stale, as new-laid ^gge, is still found in the same
consistence, magnifide, color, and site. But so soon as ever the egg ^lineth
to Pullulation, be it either from the Incubation of the Hen, or the accession
of any other fo^^ing heat whatsoever, this Spot is presently dilated, and
widened like the Ball of the eye: and from it (as from the choicest center of
the egg) the secret plastic faculty does issue out, and germinate. And yet
this first Principle of the egg was never yet (to my knowledge) observed by
any man.

Now, at the second day of Incubation, when the Egg has grown warm four and
twenty hours under the Hen, as its cavity which is in the obtuse angle is much
amplified, and fallen lower; so also does the interior constitution of the
egg vary and change. For the Yolk which before stuck fast in the center of the
White, arises toward the bl^^ angle; and the middle part of it, where the
Spot i^ ingrafted, is elevated, and applies it self to that membrane which
encompasseth the cavity, so that now the Yolk seems to be annexed to the
cavity by the Cicatrice. And as much as the Yolk rises upward, so much is the
grosser part of the White depressed toward the acute or lower angle Whence it
appears (as Fabricius rightly noted) that either Aristotle was in an error,
or else the Hist. an. l. 6. c. 3.
there is a fault in the impression, where it is said, About that time (namely,
within three days and a nights) the yellow humor is lifted to the (...) there
where the eggs beginning is, and where the egg^ is naked there about (namely,
at the dilated cavity. For Aristotle calls that the beginning where the Acute
Angle is, which parts last from the Henn^ Ibid. l. 3. c. 2.
But notwithstanding all this, it is an undoubt^ truth, that the Yolke arises
toward the Blunt angle of the egg, and that the cavity is there dilated And
so questionless Aldrovandus is deceived, (...) (though he speak as if he had
experimented (...) matter) says, that the Yolk rises to the Acute angle. I
confess, I have sometimes seen, about second and third day, the Cicatricula
dilated, and a foundation laid toward the formation of the Foetus, when the
yolk as yet was not ascended. But this is very rare, and I conceived it to
happen so, by reason of the imbecility, and infirmity of the Egg.

On the second day of Incubation, or first of Inspection, the foresaid Spot is
dilated to the magnitude of a Pease, or Lentil, and is divided into circles,
(as if they were drawn by a pair of Compasses) which have a very small white
Point for their Center. It is very probable, that Aldrovandus also did observe
this Macula, or Spot; for he says, In the midst of the yolk there appeared
some kind of whitish thing. So did Coiterus, where he says, The second day,
there remained in the middle of the yolke a whiter part. And Parisanus also,
who says, The second day, I saw a white substance about the bigness of an
indifferent fair Lentile, and of that figure: and this (says he) is the Cocks
semen, enwrapped in a white and most slender coat, lying under the two common
membranes of the egg, but above the proper containing coat of the yolke. And
yet I conceive, that no man hitherto has acknowledged, that this Cicatricula
was to be found in every egg, nor that it was the first Principle of the Egg.

In the mean while the Chalazae or seed-pearls, do decline on each side from
the two ends of the egg, toward the sides: and this proceeds from the
shifted situation of the White and Yolk. So that one of the Chalazae
descends something from the obtuse angle, and the other ascends
proportionably, from the Acute; as in an Oblique Sphere, by how much one Pole
is elevated above the Horizon, by so much is the other depressed under it.

And now the Yolk (especially about that part where the Cicatricula resideth)
does begin to dissolve and melt a little, and the proper coat thereof (which in
staler eggs is remiss, slack, and wrinckled) grows smooth and full; the Yolk
it self also seems to have regained the same color, consistence, and
inoffensive taste, which it formerly had, when the egg was new.

And this is the first days Progress of the Egg, toward a Chicken, and the
first platform of its approach. But Aldrovandus adds, that there is as yet no
alteration at all in the White; wherein he says right. But where he
affirms, that the Semen of the Cock is perceived in the Yolk, he is
apparently in the wrong. His Argument by which he would maintain the Chalazae
to be Semen Galli, is exceeding slender, and that is, because eggs which are
destitute of these Chalazae, are not fruitful. He is much in the right; for
indeed they are not Eggs without them. For in all eggs, be they fertile, or not
fertile, these Chalazae are inseparable In-mates. But perhaps the Good-wives
deceived him (which call these Chalazae, Galladura, in Italian) and so betrayed
him into the common Heresy. Nor is Hieronymus Fabricius less guilty of
Imprudence, who offers to our view the formation of the Pullus, graven in
several Tables; contending, that it is bodyed, and constituted out of these
Chalazae; not so much as taking notice, that the Chalazae are all this while
both of them entire, and unaltered (having only removed their stations) and
that the Exordium of the Chicken is to be sought a good distance from the
Chalazae.

The second Inspection of the Egg.
EXERCIT. XVI.
WHen two days are now passed, the aforesaid circles of the Cicatricula are
more ample, and conspicuous, being of the breadth of the Ring-finger, and
sometimes of the Middle; wherein the whole Macula or Spot is divided into two
(and sometimes into three) Regions, and those oftentimes inammelled, and
obscurely shadowed with several colors; fully representing the figure of an
Eye, and that not only by reason of its protuberance, like that in the Tunica
Cornea, or horny membrane, or coat of the Eye; but magnitude also, and likewise
of that most transparent, most lucid humor contained in it: whose Center
represents the Pupilla, or sight of the eye; but having a white point fixed
in the center, it resembles the eye of some small Bird, where the middle of
the Pupilla is blemished and disfigured by some suffusion, or Cataract: (as
they call it) and from this Resemblance we call it Oculum Ovi, the Eye of the
Egg. Between these Circles is contained a most bright refulgent liquor,
clearer then any Crystalline humor in the world; which if you look upon
against the light, the whole Macula will now rather appear in the White of the
Egg, then rivited into the membrane of the Yolke (as formerly it did) and
(like some part or portion of the White, dissolved, and clarified) contained
and bounded within a most slender coat belonging to it self. And this is the
reason why I call this Liquor, Oculum, the Eye, or Colliquamentum Candidum, the
white dissolved substance; as if it were some portion of the white of the Egg,
melted and liquefied by the heat shining in its own sphere apart, (unless it be
scattered and distracted by concussion) and seems like a more refined, and
more concocted, spirituous part, distinguished from the courser White by a
peculiar enclosure of its own, and seated and inthroned in the midst, between
both Yolk and White. It as much surpasses the rest of the White in clearness,
and transparence, as the most Crystal Spring excels the troubled Lake. The
Coat encircling this humor, is so nice and frail, that (if you be not
exceeding circumspect) it will soon be rent, and so disparage the purity of
this, with the confusion of other liquors.

And here my thoughts were a long time strangly divided, what I should resolve
concerning this Candidum colliquamentum; whether I should name it the Calidum
Innatum, or Humidum Radicale, the Radical Heat, or Moisture, or the prepared
matter from which the future foetus was to take its rise: or the Aliment
exactly concocted, such as the Ros is reputed to be amongst the secundary
humors? For I was fully satisfied (as I shall declare hereafter) that in the
midst of this the first rudiments of the Foetus lay, and that this also was its
nourishment, and after it was of some growth, the place of its abode.

Hence it appears, that this Colliquamentum is soon enlarged, (namely in the
compass of a day) as is evidently deciphered in Fabricius his second Figure,
especially the inward Region of it; which, while it dilateth it self, it
obliterateth and quite expungeth the outward. As you may observe in the Eyes of
those creatures whose fight of the Eye is very large, and therefore they see
better in the Night then in the Day (of which kind are Owls, Cats, and the
like; whose Sight is most dilated in the dark, but more contracted in the
Light:) for if you transfer such a creature nimbly from the light into the
shade, you shall perceive plainly how the the sight is distended, so that it
will much diminish the other circle, (which is called the Iris) and almost
quite overrun it.

Parisanus lighting upon these circles, was much mistaken; for he mustereth up
amongst his circles, a white one, a yellow one, one of the complexion of honey,
and another white one besides; asserting the foetus to be made of the middle
white point (which does indeed really appear in the midst of those circles)
which he fancieth to be the Semen Galli. And that he may approve himself more
cunning and subtle yet, Before (says he) there appears any blushing or
redness in the body of the Foetus, there are in it as it were two exceeding
small Bullulae or Bubbles; neither of which has any ruddiness at all at the
first: and one of these Bullulae he would obtrude upon us for the Heart, and
the other for the Liver. But the truth is, that no such Bullula is to be seen
at all, before a sanguine ruddiness does appear; Nor does the Foetus look red
at all at first; Nor do any of those Bullulae give us any representation at all
of a Liver, but both of them express the two Ventricles of the Heart, and by
leaping (as shall be explained hereafter) do make mutual returns to one another
by their Systole and Diastole.

Aristotle seems to have understood this colliquamentum, Hist. an. l. 6. c. 3.
where he says, About that time (namely the third day) there is a certain
membrane divaricated with certain sanguineous fibers, which contain a white
liquor, arising from the spriggs of those veins. For by white liquor, he could
not mean the whole white of the egg; because the coat of the white is not then
sprinkled with veins, but only the coat of this colliquamentum. And therefore
he says, There is a membrane also, intimating a distinct membrane from those
of the Yolk and White, in that he says it arises from the spriggs of the
veins, about the third day. Coiterus also seems to have acknowledged this
colliquamentum, saying, Some part of the White approaches nearer to whiteness
then the other, and some to density. Now the aforesaid colliquamentum is
encompassed with its proper coat, and is distinct and separate from the rest of
the White, before any part at all of the blood appear.

We shall have occasion to discourse hereafter of the mighty use of this
colliquamentum, in relation to the foetus of all kind of Animals. For while
they swim there, they are guarded, and skreened from all concussion, contusion,
and other outward injuries, and are also nourished by it.

I saw long since a foetus of the magnitude of a Pease-cod, cut out of the
Uterus of a Do, which was complete in all its members (so that it was
apparently a Male by the parts:) I showed this pretty Spectacle and Rarity of
Nature to our late King, and Queen. It did swim, trim and perfect, in such a
kind of White, most transparent, and crystalline moisture (as if it had been
treasured up in some most clear glassie receptacle) about the bigness of a
Pigeous egg, and was invested with its proper coat.

The third Inspection of the Egg.
EXERCIT. XVII.
WE have seen the second Progress, or preparation of the Egg toward the
Foetus, which falls within the third days Observation. It follows that we
now attend the third Appearance; which presents it self to our view after
three days and as many nights.

And of this Aristotle: There do begin to appear Hist. ^ 1. ^. 6. c. 3.
some indications of Generation in Hens, after three days, and so many
nights; (as suppose upon Monday morning, in case that on the precedent
Frydaymorning the Eggs were laid under the Hen, then ready to sit) and the
declaration of this Inspection, is the purpose of Fabricius his third Figure.

If therefore you observe on the fourth day, you will meet a great
Metamorphosis, and wonderful alteration; which are more evident, for almost
every hour all that day long: about which time the Egg begins to step from
the life of a Plant, to the life of an Animal. For now the Limbus or hemme of
the colliquamentum begins to blush and purple, being encompassed with a
slender bloody line: and in the center almost of it, there leapeth a capering
bloody point, which is yet so exceeding small, that in its Diastole, or
Dilatation, it flasheth only like the most obscure and almost indiscernable
spark of fire; and presently upon its Systole or Contraction, it is too subtle
for the eye, and quite disappeareth. So slender are the first Rudiments of
Creatures lives, which the Plastical faculty sets on foot by so undiscoverable
beginnings.

If you are desirous to make discovery of this observation toward the declining
of the third day, you may if you be extremely intent, by the assistance of a
clear and great light, or by the Sun beams, or a Perspective, make a shift to
discern it. For else, this purple streak is so exceeding nice, and fine, and
the motion of the Punctum saliens is so imperceptible, that you will only loose
your labor. But, at the beginning of the fourth day it is evident, and at the
end thereof, most notoriously visible, that the Punctum sanguineum saliens has
now Animal motion (says Aristotle) in the candid liquor: (which I call
colliquamentum.) And from that (Point) two hollow threads like veins, full of
blood, are carried crooked to the purple Line, and the coat encompassing the
colliquamentum: scattering as they pass along many fibrous branches through the
whole space and continent of the colliquamentum, all which spring from the same
Original (as the boughs of Trees from the same Trunk,) In the crooked Angle of
this Root, and the Middle of the colliquamentum, the Punctum Rubrum Saliens is
enthroned, which keeps time and decorum in its pulsation, compounded of a
Systole, and Diastole. In the Diastole, as if it did imbibe a larger proportion
of blood, it dilates it self, and leaps; but connives in the Systole, as if it
suffered a convulsion by the stroke, and resigned the blood again.

Fabricius has described this Punctum or Point, in his third Figure, and,
(which is strange) took it for the body of the Foetus; as if either he had not
observed its leaping, and pulsation, or else had not understood that text of
Aristotle, or at best had forgotten it. But that which is yet more strange, is,
that he should be nothing mindful all this while of his chalazae, from which
himself deduces the rudiments of the chicken.

Ulysses Aldrovandus, a Writer in Bouonia, about Ornithol. l. 14. page 217.
that time says, There appeared in the White a little kind of Punctum saliens,
or capering Point, which is the same which Aristotle decrees to be the Heart.
Out of which I plainly discovered a little Trunk of a vein to arise, and two
other little branches tending toward this, which were those very channels of
blood, which he had wrote to be sent forth to the two coats encompassing the
Yolk and White. Now I am clear of his Opinion, conceiving those passages to be
Veins, and to have a pulsation, containing a purer blood in them, and such as
is useful and proper for the generation of the more principle parts; namely,
the Liver, and the Lungs, and the like. But both these are not veins, nor have
they both a pulsation; for one is an Artery, the other a vein, as we shall
hereafter show: where we shall also declare, that these Meatus do become the
Umbilical vessels of the Foetus.

Volcherus Coiter has these words: The little bloody Point, or Globulus found
before in the yolke, is now rather in the white, and evidently pulsatile. Now
he is out, in sayng, It was found before in the yolke; for that Point which was
in the yolke was white; and did not leap neither; nor does the bloody point or
Globulus appear to leap the second day after Incubation. But that Point (which
we have declared to be placed in the Middle of the round, as if it were the
center, and which is annexed to the yolke) does vanish quite away, before the
Point, which Aristotle calls Punctum saliens, can be discerned at all, or (as
I believe) becomes red, and leaping. For both these Points are seated in the
center of the colliquamentum, and near the root and original of the veins
which spring from thence: but they are never seen together, but the Red, which
is the Punctum saliens, succeeds in the place of the White one.

In this indeed Volcherus is in the right, where be says, The Punctus saliens
is now rather found in the White, then in the Yolke. By which words, ^ was
incited to make diligent search, whether th^^ Punctus albus be transmuted into
the Punctum sanguineum; because both of them are almost of the same magnitude,
and did seem situate in the same place. And sometimes, I found, the glistering
purple circle which is the outermost, ending about the vermilion horizon,
encompassed by the Colliquamentum; in whose center there was the Punctus albus,
but not the Ruber, or Saliens: but I never saw those two Points together. This
disquisition is of great moment; namely, Whether there be blood before
Pulsation, and, Whether the Punctus arise from the Veins, or the Veins from
the Punctus?

According to my observation the Blood seems to be before the Pulse; and I
therefore believe it, because, Upon Wednesday about the Evening, I put three
eggs under the Hen, and upon Saturday, a little before the same time, I found
these eggs cold, as being forsaken by the Hen; however, opening one of them,
I found the rudiments of a Chicken; namely the Purple and bloody Line in the
circle: but in the center, instead of the Punctum saliens, I found the Punctum
album, which is bloodless. By which I perceived the Hen had not long deserted
her charge: whereupon, seizing upon her by force, I penned her up all night,
having first laid the two former remaining eggs, with other that were not
there before, into the Nest. Now for the success: The next morning betimes, my
two eggs were well recovered; and I found in the center the Punctum Micans,
which was much less then the Punctum Album; out of which (namely the Punctum
Album) a spark or lightning, darting as it were from a cloud, appeared in the
Diastole only: So that to my Apprehension, the Punctum Rubrum did leap out of
the Punctum Album, at least that Punctum is generated in the Punctum Album, and
(...) being now there, has its Birth, or at least its (...) there. Nay, I have
many times observed, The Punctum saliens, when (as quite expired) it lay
deprived of all motion, it has regained fresh motion and pulsation, by a new
heat and cherishing. Therefore in order of Generation, I conceive that the
Punctum and Blood do first exist, but the pulsation arriveth not till afterward.

And this is most certain, that nothing at this time appears, besides the
bloody streaks, the Punctum saliens, and those Veins which are all derived from
one Trunk (as that Trunk it self from the Punctum saliens) and do afterward
constitute the Umbilical Vessels: which being disseminated far and wide, the
foetus at length (according to it growth) does attract sustenance from the Yolk
and White. You may see a lively resemblance of these Veins and their
propagations in the leaves of Trees, whose fibers do all proceed from the
pedunculus or stalk, and are diffused from one Trunk through the whole capacity
of the Leaf.

This whole entire Colliquamentum, distinguished and sprinkled with bloody
fibers, represents the form and magnitude of the two wings of a Butterfly.
And it is no other then that Membrane which Aristotle In loc. supra dict.
speaks of, where he says, The Membrane divaricated with bloody fibers,
contains then a white liquor, springing from those Meatus of the Veins.

About the end of the fourth, and beginning of the fifth day, being now
enlarged, it seems to be changed into a small thin bladder, containing blood
in it; which it ejects at every contraction, and recalls again at every
diastole.

Hitherto I could not discover any distinction of Vessels: for the Arteries do
not yet differ from veins, either in coat, or Pulsation: and therefore I call
the vessels indifferently veins, or with Aristotle, Meatus Venales, Veinal
Passages, or Channels.

This Punctum (says Aristotle) now bestirres it self like an Animal; for
Motion and Sense distinguish an Animal from a non Animal. Since therefore this
Punctum begins now first to move, we may justly say it has put on the nature
of an Animal: and that the Egg which was before endowed with a vegetative
soul, is now over and above that, furnished with a Motive and sensation power;
and is raised from a Plant to an Animal and that at the same time the soul of
the Foetus is gone in, which first forms the chicken ou^ of the Egg, and
afterward informs that chicken. For Aristotle demonstratively resolves of the
Lib. de Anima.
Faculties, by the Operations; and from them also concludes of the cause and
fountain of Life (namely the Soul) and that to be in, actually, (where the
Operations actually are.)

And I am confirmed by many proofs and experiments, that not motion only is
now the companion of the Punctum saliens, but also Sense it self For upon every
touch, be it never so gentle, it is variously provoked, and disturbed, (at the
same rate as sensative bodies proclaim their distastes by particular motions)
and so offended with repe^^^ injuries, that they did confound the chime and
order of its pulses. So in the Plant, called the sensative Plant, and other
Zoophyta, we conclude there is sense; because upon touch they contract
themselves, and take it unkindly.

I have, I say, often seen, and so have many more who have been present, this
Punctum, upon contaction by a needle, probe, or the finger it self, nay upon
the admission of a more searching heat or cold, or any other thing that could
molest, and disorder, declare many symptoms of its resentment; for it would
fly into many permutations of pulse, beating much stronger, and nimble then
before. So that, no question, this Punctum does (as an Animal) Live, Move, and
Perceive.

Moreover, expose an egg too long to the colder air, and the Punctum saliens
beats slower, and has a languishing motion; but lay your finger warm upon it,
or cherish it kindly any other way, and it presently gains strength and
vigor. And after this Punctum has declined by degrees, and being full of
blood has ceased from all motion, exhibiting no specimen of life at all, and
was given up for lost, and dead, upon laying of my finger warm upon it, for the
space of only twenty pulses, the poor heart has awaked, and recovered again,
and as it were rescued from the grave, proceeds to its former harmony afresh.
And this has been done again and again by me, and others, by any other
reviving heat, were it of the Fire, or warm Water: as if it were in our dispose
to condemn the little Soul to the Shades, or repreive it to life, at pleasure.

What we have here delivered, does for the most part come to pass the fourth
day from the first Incubation, or at the Third Inspection. I say, for the most
part; for it falls not out perpetually so, because there is a great diversity
in the maturity of Eggs, and some come to perfection sooner then their
fellows. As is usually in the fruits of any Tree, whereof some are ripe, and
ready to fall of themselves: whilst others are crude and greener, and cannot
be shaken from the Boughs. So that some Eggs are less forward the fifth day,
then others the third. And (that I may instance in what I have found and tried)
I have found this true in very many eggs, whom the Hen has fostered the same
length of time, and I have opened them all the same day. So that I have had no
cause to quarrel against the weaker Sex, the distemper of the Air, the neglect
of the Hen, or any other Accident; but only the innate weakness of the
Egg; and the penury of the ingenit Heat.

Ova Hypenemia, or Addle Eggs, do at this time (as in a critical day) begin to
alter and discover their genius: For as fruitful Eggs, by the innate plastic
virtue do alter and resolve into a Colliquamentum (which does after shift into
blood) so Subventaneous Eggs, at the same time, begin to corrupt, and putrify.
And yet I have sometimes observed the Macula or Cicatricula to be distended
wider even in barren eggs; but it never rose up to the top, nor was ever
circumscribed by the circles orderly drawn about it. I have also sometimes seen
the Yolk grow clear, and liquifie, and the parts congealed, as it were, by
rash, inconsiderate coagulation, float up and down like scattered clouds. And
though these Eggs cannot yet be called corrupt, putrid, and unsavory; yet they
are very much prepared toward putrefaction, and do completely arrive thither,
by the continuation of the warmth of the Sitting-Henne, and set out their
progress toward corruption, from the very place and stage, whence prolifical
Eggs advance to Generation.

The Perfecter sort of Eggs therefore do now about the declension of the
fourth day, acquire a twofold, or bipartite Vesicula pulsans, or vesicle of
pulsation, one making answer and replies, to the other by a double pulsation,
in that Order and Method, that whilst one is contracted, the other shines and
swells with blood; which presently being contracted, discharges it self of the
blood that was in it; and in a moments time intervening, the former swells and
returns the Pulse, so that you may evidently see, that the action of these
vesicles is Contraction; by which the Blood is driven, and pumped into the
vessels.

The fourth day, (says Aldrovandus) the two Puncta were discovered, and each
of them did move: which two points were without doubt the Heart and page 217.
the Liver; which Viscera Aristotle says are seen in the Eggs after three
days Incubation.

But Aristotle never said so, nor are those viscera usually to be seen before
the tenth day. And I wonder Aldrovandus could think one of these Puncta
Pulsantia was the Liver: as if the Liver ever had any such motion.

It is safer to believe that one of the Puncta salientia (when the Foetus
enlarges) does constitute the Auriculae or deaf Ears, and the other the
Ventriculi, or Ventricles of the Heart. For in grown bodies, the Ventricles of
the Heart are after this manner filled, and supplied by the Auriculae, which by
their Systole, are depleated and emptied again: as we have observed in our
Tract, de Motu cordis and sanguinis. In better grown eggs, sometimes about the
declining of the fourth day, I know not what cloudy substance did obscure these
Vesiculae Pulsantes, and did (like an interposed shade) obstruct my Inspection,
that I could not so clearly discern the Puncta salientia. Yet by the help of a
clearer light, and with a Perspective, and conferring with my observations for
the subsequent days: it appeared to be the Rudiment of the foetus, or a Cloud
exhaled from the Colliquamentum, or an Effluvium congealing about the beginning
of the veins: as shall more at large be treated of in the fifth days
observation.

Aldrovandus also seems to have observed it: The fifth day, (says he) that
Punctum which we called the Heart, did no longer appear to move outwardly, but
seemed rather to be covered, and concealed; and the two Meatus Venosi were seen
more conspicuous, but one larger then the other. But the Learned Aldrovandus is
deceived, for this Tutelar deity takes possession, and locks himself up in
most reserved and secret recesses (when the habitation is almost completely
erected) a long time after. And he likewise mistakes, where he says, that by
the innate virtue of the veins, the remaining portion of the white is turned
into a kind of straw-coloured substance. For that complexion is in the the
thicker white, of all eggs that are stale, and is daily increased in them,
(namely, according as the Egg grows Staler, as is said) and that without any
assistance of veins, by reason of the thinner substance exhaling.

But the Foetus growing bigger, (as we shall declare in its place) and the
circles of the branches of the veins being disseminated up and down, part of
both the juyces are dissolved, not (as Aldrovandus would have it) by an innate
virtue of the veins, but by the heat of the blood inhabiting there. For into
what part soever of the moisturer the foresaid veins extend their Territories,
there presently appears a colliquation or resolution in the bordering parts;
and therefore the Yolk at that time seems double, because its superior part
(which is joined to the cavity above, about the obtuse angle) being more
mollified, and dissolved then the rest of the Yolk, appears like melted Wax,
compared to the other cold, compacted part. And upon that score (as all melted
things do) it obtains a larger room. And that Upper part, liquefied by the
genital warmth is disterminated from the other liquors (and especially from the
White) by a peculiar most thin coat of its own. Whence it happens, that a
breach being made upon this slender, frail, and invisible membrane, there
presently follows a confusion and mixture of the Yolk and White, which disturbs
the whole frame. And it is many times a cause to frustrate and void Generation
(when those liquors become to be of a diverse, nay of a contrary nature)
according to that Text in Aristotle, de genesis an. l. 3. c. 2.
so often cited. Eggs are depraved and made addle most in hot weather, and
that upon good reason. For as Wines grow sower in hotter weather, the dregs
being subverted (for that is the cause of their depravation) so Eggs are
destroyed, their Yolk being corrupted: for these are the more terrene and
earthy parts in both. So that Wine is disturbed by a commixture of the dregs,
and the Eggs by diffusion of the Yolk. And hither you may justly reduce that
of Hist. an. l. 6. c. 2.
him too, where he says, Eggs that are under the Hen in tempestuous
thunders, are corrupted. For the exceeding small membrane is by so great a noise
quickly torn asunder. And therefore perhaps, confused and putrid Eggs, are
called Ova Cynosura, because (as we have observed) it thunders Lib. 8. c. 5.
most in the Dog Days. And therefore Columella rightly admonishes, that most
men deem the Summer-Solstice to be inconvenient for hatching of chickens.

This is most certain, that Eggs suffer quassation, concussion, and
dissolution very easily, if any man disturb them while the Hen is Sitting,
because at that time the liquors in them are liquefied, and swell, and the
membranes embracing them are dilated, and grow tender.

The fourth Inspection of the Egg.
EXERCIT. XVIII.
THE fifth day of Incubation, is discerned first (says Aristotle) the body of
the Pullus, being very Hist. an. l. 6. c. 3.
small, and white, wherein the head is conspicum and in it the eyes much
turgent, which continue so a long time, for it is long ere they abate, and
connive. But in the lower part of the body, there is no part ^^ first extant,
correspondent to the upper. But th^s^ Branches which shoot out from the Heart,
one tending to the ambient membrane, the other to the Yolk, do supp^^ the
office of the Navel. The original of the Chicken therefore from the White, but
its nourishment from the Yolk by the Navel.

By which words Aristotle seems to distrib^^^ the whole Generation of the
Pullus into three class^^ or orders, namely from the first day of Incubation to
the fifth: and thence, on to the tenth or fourteenth and so on to the
twentieth. As if he had o^^ recorded those things in his History, which he ^
covered at these three Inspections. The great changes in the Egg do indeed
happen at these times: as if by these Decretory days, as by three distinct
degrees, the progress of the perfect Egg, to the utmost exclusion of the
Chicken, were distinguished. For the fourth day the first particle of the
Foetus, namely the Punctum saliens, and the Blood appear; and after that the
Foetus is corporated. The Seventh, the Chicken is distinguished into parts, and
begins to move. The tenth it begins to be down-feathered; about the
twentieth, it breathes, and cries according to its kind, and seeks to make its
escape. The Life which it obtains about the fourth day, seems to emulate that
of Plants, and is to be esteemed only a vegitative animation. But from that to
the tenth, it enjoyes a sensative and moving soul as Animals do: and after
that, it is completed by degrees, and being adorned with Pl^^es, Bill, Claws,
and other furniture, it hastens to get out, that being at length emancipated,
it may be unconfined and free.

Aristotle therefore enumerates amongst those things which befall after the
fourth day, chiefly three; that is to say, the fabric of the body, the
branchings of the veins, which now supply the Nature and Office of the Navel:
and the matter or substance whence the Foetus does first spring, and is
constituted, and nourished.

Concerning the Fabric of the Body, he relates four things, first, what
magnitude it is of; secondly, what complexion; thirdly, what parts are most
conspicuous, (namely the Head, and Eyes) and lastly, what distinction or
difference there is between the Parts. Truth is, the Body is exceeding small,
resembling in form that common worm or Maggot, out of which the Fly is bred;
it is also white of color, like that little Worm, which the Fly depositeth in
putrified flesh. to be cherished, and bred up; and he elegantly adds, that it
is most notorious from its Head and Eyes. For that which first appears, is a
similar and indistinct Body, as if it were some concrete and congealed
substance of the colliquamentum it self (like that Gelly which is made of the
decoction of Hartshorn) being like a transparent cloud, which were hardly
distinguishable, were it not divided as it were into two parts; whereof the one
lies in a heap together; and is much larger then the other, being the Rudimens
of the Head; which is first discerned on the fifth day: in which the Eyes are
anon manifestly distinguished; which at first are the biggest of all, much
puffed up, and prominent, and are discriminated both from the rest of the Head,
and the whole Body besides, by a certain blackness cast round about them. Any
one of these, is larger then the whole Head; as also, the Head alone exceeds
all there of the Body in magnitude. This Whiteness of the Body, endures a
while, as also, the tumor of the Eyes: (which are filled also with a most clear
moisture or water within, but are dark and blackish without, as it is also with
the Brain) that is to say, to the tenth day, and more: for (says Aristotle) It
is late ere they diminish, and contract to their allotted proportion. Nay,
according to my observation, the Eyes of Birds do never reduce themselves to
the Proportion, which is allotted as the standard between the Eyes, and the
Head of a Viviparous Animal. For if you lay aside the Skin, which covers the
Eyes of a Hen, or any other Bird, either of them alone will soon countervail
the whole bulk of the Brain: In a Woodcock and the like, any one of the Eyes
is bigger then all the Head besides, (bateing only the Bill) but it is common
to all Birds whatsoever to have the Orbita, or cavity which contains the Eyes
to exceed the Brain it self, as you may see in their cranium, or Scull. But
yet it falls out that their Eyes seem lesser, because they are all (except the
Sight or Apple only) shrouded with Skin and Plumes; nor are they of an
Orbicular Figure (which might occasion their prominence or standing out) but of
a Depressed, as Fishes eyes are.

In the lower part of the Body (says Aristotle) there is no part extant at
first, which is correspondent to the Superior: And so indeed it is: The Body at
first were scarce discernable, were it not for the Eyes and the Head; so that
downwards, it is not distinguished by any members at all, whether Wings, Feet,
Breast Bone, Rump, or any Viscus: nor indeed is it graced with any Shape of a
Body: but as far as I could discover, it is only a Little Substance, next
adjacent to the small vein, like the carina or keele of an imaginable small
Ship wound up together, and like a Maggot or Worm, without any platform of
Ribs, Legs, or Wings: to which is fastened a little round body, which is the
rudiment of the Head, which is more discernable th^n it, and divided into three
Bubbles, (on which fid: soever you make your Inspection:) But it is indeed
divided into four, whereof two are largest, and blackish, being the rudiments
of the Eyes; the third of the Brain; and the fourth of the cerebellum, or
After-Braine. All these are full of exceeding clear Water, but in the middle of
the Blackness of the eyes, is the Apple or Ball of the Eye (as in the Center)
shining like a transparent Spark or Crystal. Hence I suppose, the Tres Bullae,
the three Bubbles which are only conspicuous, have imposed upon those, who
have not througly observed the thing. For having learnt, according to the old
doctrine of the Schools, that there were three Principalities in the Animal
Body, and three Principal Parts; (namely, the Brain, the Heart, and the Liver)
executing the chief Functions: They soon induced themselves to believe, that
these Three Bullae were the platformes, and ground-works of these three parts.
But Coiterus, as becomes a skilful Anatomist, affirms much truer, that he saw,
on the Seventh day after Incubation, the Bill, and the Eyes, but could discover
none of the Viscera.

But to Aristotle again. Those Branches, which proceed from the Heart, one of
them tends to the circumambient membrane, the other to the Yolk, supplying
the office of a Navel. The Foetus being now bodied, those veins do execute the
office of a Navel: and one of their branches, or propagations is disseminated
into the outward coat, which embraces the White; but the sprouts of the other
go directly to the coat of the Yolk, and are disseminated through its juice or
liquor. By which it is plain and evident, that both the Liquors are dedicated
to the nourishment of the Foetus. And though Aristotle say, that the Original
of the chicken is from the White, and its nourishment from the Yolk by the
Navel: Yet he does not say that the chicken is made of the White; for the
Foetus is made of that white Liquor which we call the colliquamentum: and all
that which we call Oculum Ovi, the Eye of the Egg, is contained in the White.
Nor does he say that the sustenance of the Chicken is only from the Yolk by
the Navel: but I shall interpret his words (according to my one Observations)
thus: Though the Pullus assume its original in the White, yet it is not fed by
the White only, but by the Yolk also (to which one of the Sprigs of the
Umbilical veins does extend) nay chiefly by the Yolk; for the White (according
to Aristotle) is the more concocted, and purer liquor of the egg, but the Yolk
the more terrene, and solid, and therefore more congruous to the Chicken, when
he is grown stronger: and therefore (as shall be said hereafter) it supplies
the place of Milk, and is that which is last consumed; for the remainder of it
(after the Chichen is hatched, and walks abroad with the Hen) it yet
contained in its Belly.

What I have hitherto spoken, comes to pass, from the fourth day to the
seventh. But When, How, and in what Order, all the Particulars are framed, I
shall now explain.

The Next Appearance, which presents it self the fifth day, about the short
vein drawn from the Angle (where the two points leaping in course are seated)
there appears a grosser, and whiter substance, like a little cloud, (which yet
is transparent) through which the foresaid vein does obscurely, and as through
a cloud, cast a glimpse of it self. I have seen the same sometimes, in well
grown eggs, upon the fourth day. But this is the Rudiment of the Body, which
now every hour grows more close, and compact, and does encompasse the
foresaid vein, and also is annexed to it, like a little globous body. That
globous Rudiment does much exceed the Keele (as I may call it) of this little
Worm, in magnitude: and it is of a triangular figure, that is to say, (like the
small sprout of a knotted shrubbe) obscurely divided into three pieces: Whereof
one is Orbicular, and larger then the other two, and looks black, by reason of
some most slender fibers, which are drawn from the Circumference toward the
Center: resembling the platform of the Septum Ciliare, and therefore it
implies, that this particle is transformed into the Eye. In the midsts of this,
is a very little Pupilla or Eye-Ball, appearing like a most bright point: (as
we have said) and upon that ground I raised my conjecture, that this entire
little round body, was designed for the Rudiment of the Head: and that that
black circle was to be one of the Eyes, to which the other stands opposite on
the other side: for they are so seated, that you cannot discern them both at
once, because the uppermost covers and hides the lower.

This first Rudiment of the Body, which we affirm to grow about the vein,
(has obtained an oblong, and something an embowed figure, (like the Keel of a
Ship; it is of a mucous consistence, like the film or hoariness which is
contracted by moist things, when they are pent up in a close place. But the
small vein to which this hoary substance does accrue, is the descending Vena
Cava, passing along the Spine of the Back: as my subsequent observations have
cleared. If you diligently mind the order of the pulsation of the two vesicles,
you shall discern the blood driven by the Systole of that which was last
contracted into the beginning of this vein, and this vein distended by it.

So that there are two manifest Contractions and Dilatations of the two
vesicles which cause a motion and pulse in one another: and the preceding
Contraction of the one, creates the Distention of the other: for the blood
being darted into the second vesicle, by the Contraction of the cavity of the
first, causes an impletion, distention, and pulsation in it: which by and by
contracting it self, disgorgeth the blood (which it now received from the
former vesicle) into the beginning of the foresaid vein, and so dilateth that.
I call it yet a vein, though by its pulse I conceive it to be the Artery,
called Aorta; for the Arteries are not yet distinguished from the veins by the
thickness of their coats.

Having often observed these things with much caution and circumspection in
several eggs, I stood a while in suspense, what opinion I should entertain of
them. As, whether I should conclude this concrete, and annexed globous body
were made of the Colliquamentum, (in which it swam) as out of a compacted and
coagulated substance; as Clouds are formed out of vapors in the upper Region
of the Air (which vapors were never discovered to ascend:) Or else out of some
Effluvium or exhalation of blood transpiring, or some Transudation, weeping by
a kind of diapedesis, from the vein. For the first Rudiments even of the
greatest things, are exceeding small, and so very obscure, because very little.

This, I presume, I am assured of, viz. that the Puncta salientia, the
Branchings of the veins, and the Vena cava it self are first existent, and that
afterward this corpulency or bulk is joined to them. And I am also most
certain, that the Blood is driven into this Vein out of the Punctum saliens,
and that by this Vein that little bulk or body is fed. For that first hoariness
or Mucus is first of all made by an Effluvium of the Vein, (to which it grows)
and from it afterward draws its nourishment and increase: As filme and
hoariness does in other moist places grow between the chincks of walls, which
lie long unswept; as Camphyre upon Cedar-planks, and Moss upon Stones, and
Barks of Trees; or lastly, as a kind of down is bred upon some kind of
Worms.

I did also doubt at the same time, whether this Rudiment of the Head and Body
had its existence so soon, as the coagulation of the Colliquamentum, together
with the Blood, and Punctum saliens had theirs, but was then imperciptible by
reason of its thinness, and clearness of substance; till congealing into a
grosser film, it put on a more solid, compacted whiteness, by which it might be
discerned: while yet the Blood which is thicker and shining might be well
perceived in the Colliquamentum which is so diaphanous. But whilst I consider
the matter more narrowly, I am fully satisfied, that the Blood has a being,
before any other part of the body besides, and is the elder brother to all
other parts of the foetus; and that from it, both the matter out of which the
foetus is constituted, as also the aliment by which it is supplied, is desumed,
and is (if any thing be) the first genital particle. But how I am induced to
this persuasion, shall be afterward copiously recited, when we discourse
concerning the primitive fructifying Part, the Innate Heat, and Radical
Moisture; and when also we shall resolve what is to be thought concerning the
soul, out of many Observations conferred together.

About this time, almost every hour, all things appear larger and clearer, and
more distinct, and unfolded; and now there comes a nimble Alteration in the
Egg, and many things appear one upon the neck of another. The Cavity of the
Egg is now much larger, and lays the upper part of it all void and empty, as
if a fifth part of the Egg were vanished.

The little branches of the Veins are farther spread out, and grow more numerous
in their distributions, not only into the Colliquamentum, (as before) but up
and down both into Yolke and White, and both those liquors are chequered over
with fibers. The upper part of the Yolke is much dissolved and melted, as if it
were a distinct thing from the inferior, and that the yolke were now become
two; the superior shining like melted wax, swelled, and bright; and the
inferior and earthier, together with the duller part of the White, being
depressed to the acute angle. And the proper coat of the superior part of the
yolke is now so thin, that the least concussion breaks it; upon which ensues
a confusion of liquors, and an utter frustration of generation.

And now is the first Rudiment of the Foetus to be clearly seen (as you may
perceive it in Fabricius his fifth and sixth Tables;) which being put into a
basin of clear water, will plainly discover, what parts of the body are already
framed, and what are yet wanting and behind. For there appears the form of a
small Worm or Magot, as we see the rudiments of Worms and Flies in the boughs
of Trees, in the knots of the Bark, in Fruits, Flowers, and other things; but
especially in Oak apples, in whose center, within a small round Shell or
Kernel, is contained a clear liquor, which thickning and coagulating by
degrees, is interlaced with most slender fibers, and represents the shape of a
Magot, but continues a while immovable, till at length endued with sense and
motion, it becomes an animal, and departs a Fly.

Aristotle describes a Generation like this, in Hist. an. l. 5. c. 19
those things that are called Sponte nascentia. Some creatures are born of the
Dew, which falls upon the Leaves. And a while after he says: Butterflies are
made of Worms, but these Worms of green Leaves; and especially of the Leaves of
that sort of Raphanus, which some call Brassica. They are first smaller then
Millet, and afterward very little worms; then increasing, within three days
they become little Magots; and after this being more grown, they cease to move,
and changing their form, are called Crystallides, being contained in a hard
crust; and if you touch them, they stir: a great while after the crust or
shell is broken, and so they being become winged creatures, take their flight,
and are called Butterflies.

But we shall prove anon, that the Generation of all creatures is alike, and
that all creatures, even perfect ones, are begotten of a Worm; which Aristotle
also seems to have noted, where he says: In all Creatures, even those which
produce a perfect egg, the de genesis an. l. 3. c. 9.
first conception grows before it be distinguished: such is also the nature
of the Worm. Now this difference there is between the generation of the Worm,
and other Creatures; that the Worm grows before he have his shape, or
distinction into parts: according to that of the Philosopher, An animal is made
out of a Worm, not as if it were made out of a part of it, as out of its Egg;
but in that the whole Worm grows, and so becomes a dearticulate animal; namely,
in growing it becomes to be jointed or distinguished.

We have indeed cause to wonder, that the Rudiments De hist. an. l. 5. c. 9.
of all Creatures whatsoever, especially of Creatures that have blood, (viz. of
a Dog, a Horse, a Dear, an Ox, a Hen, a Viper, nay of Man himself) should
so exactly resemble the shape and consistence of a Magot, that you can perceive
no difference at all.

Toward the end of the Fifth day, or the beginning of the Sixth, the Head is
distinguished into three vesicles or little bladders; whereof the first; and
greatest, which is round, and blackish, is that of the Eye: in whose center the
Pupilla is discovered like a crystalline Point. Under this a lesser vesicle,
whereof part is hidden, represents the Brain; ^^ which the third, like a crest
adjoined, or a small ^^nd knobb, appears uppermost; of which at last ^he
Cerebellum or After-brain is made: yet in all ^^ese you shall find nothing,
besides a clear water.

And now the Rudiment of the Body, (which we all the Keel) does more distinctly
represent the ^pina dorsi, or Chine of the Back: to which, sides begin to be
built and appear; for the Wings and legs do now jut out from the Magot. And the
vessels do now plainly express the Navel.

The fifth Inspection of the Egg.
EXER. XIX.
THe sixth day the three Bullae of the Head do more plainly appear, and the
coats of the eyes are now distinct: also the Legs and Wings do bud forth; as at
the end of June, the Gyrini (which the Italians call Ravabottoli, and we
Tadpoles) begin to have legs, when now they forsake the wa^ers, loose their
tail, and put on the shape of Frogs.

The form of the Chickens Rump is yet no other, then that which is seen in all
other animals, may in very vipers, namely a round slender tail. The Parenchyma
of the heart now grows to the vesicula pulsans; and a little after the
Rudiments of the Liver, and Lungs are discovered, and also the Bill, all
appearing exceeding white, especially the Bill. And about this time all the
Viscera and the Guts may be seen. But the heart exposes it ^^ first to sight,
and the Lungs before the Liver or the brain. But before all are the eyes
visible, because o^ their largeness and blackness of their color.

And now the foetus moves, and gently tumbles, and stretches out the neck,
though nothing of a brain be yet to be seen, but merely a bright water shut up
in a small bladder. And now it is a perfect Magot, differing only from those
kind of worm^ in this, that those when they have their freedom, crawle up and
down, and search for their living abroad: but this worm constant to his
station, and swimming in his own provision, draws it in by his Umbilical
Vessels.

The Viscera and the Guts being now erected, and the foetus being furnished
with motion too; yet the forepart of the Body still lies wide open, being
deprived of the Thorax, and Abdomen; and the Heart it self, the Liver, and the
Guts hanging out.

About the end of this day, and the beginning of the seventh, the claws are
distinguished; and the foetus begins to have the Effigies of a Chicken, it
opens the bill, and kicks: lastly, all the parts are delineated, especially the
Eyes. But the Viscera or bowels are yet so obscure, that Coiterus truly
affirme^. That he saw indeed the Eyes and the Bill, but could discover no
Viscus at all, though never so concealed or confused.

That which follows from the beginning of the sixth day to the end of the
seventh, comes ^^ pass sooner in some, and in some eggs later. No^ are the
coats of the Eyes seen, though they have nothing in them but a liquid clear
humor: the Ey^ themselves are something prominent, or hanging out of their
seats, and each of them does no le^ exceed the brain in magnitude, then the
head, the rest of the body that is fastened to it.

A little bubble, like a crest, placed out of the circuit of the brain, supplied
the place of the cerebellum, and that is also full of a clear water.

The brain seems obscurely divided, and shines not so much as the cerebellum
does, though it look whiter. And as the Heart is now to be seen without the
enclosure of the chest, so is the cerebellum, out of the Confines of the
cerebrum.

In cutting off the Head, I saw (by the benefit of ^^y Perspective) in the
Neck, a bloody speck of ^^e vein which ascends to the brain. And by ^his
means only could I distinguish the rudiment of the Spine, from the other
Pulpe, it was of a milkey complexion, but firmer consistence then milk. And so
also like slender cobwebs, narrow white lines, wan^ing through the pulp of the
body, to give some ^^imen of the Ribbs, and other bones; and this is much more
discernable in the formation of other Viviparous Animals. The Heart, the Lungs,
the Liver, and, instead of Guts, the most slender threads, ^re all white. The
Parenchyma of the Liver ^ows to the Umbilical vein, there where it enters ^o
the Liver, upon thin fibrous strings: in like manner as the Rudiment of the
Body grows to the ^^ passing from the Heart, or to the Vesicula pul^^s. For as
Grapes grow to the cluster, buds to ^^eir stalks, and the ears of corn to the
straw: So ^^th the Liver to the Umbilical vessels, like mush^^ out of Trees, or
proud flesh in Ulcers, or fleshy ^^^rs which border upon the branches of the
Ar^^^^es, by which they are fed, and spread sometimes ^^ ^ vast tumor.

Having had an Eye upon this emploiment of Arteries, or circulation of the
blood, I have sometimes perfectly cured exceeding great Herniae carnosae,
beyond all expectation; providing only, that the little artery being tied or
cut off, no nutriment or spirit might have accession to the part affected; by
which it fell out, that the fatal tumor was afterward easily extirpated either
by incision, or adustion.

A certain man, besides other infirmities, (and of this story I can produce
many testimonies) had a Sarcosis or fleshy tumor in his Scrotum or God, bigger
then a man's head, hanging down to his Knees; and from it, another Hernia
carnosa, as thick as ones wrist (or a cable) passed into his Abdomen, so that
the disease growing to so great a height, no man would undertake the Cure, by
incision, or otherwise. Yet I perfectly cured this so vast excrescence, which
so much distended the Scrotum, and encompassed the Testicle, by the means
aforesaid; and yet left the leading and preparing vessel to the use of the
Testicle, without any prejudice or touch upon the other vessels descending into
the S^^tum, by the Tunica vaginalis, or coat of the Testicles so called. But
these and other Cures, accomplished clean beside the common opinion, I shall in
my Physical Observations (if God grant me life) discover at large.

I mention these things with this intent, that men may plainly see, that the
Liver grows to the vessels, and is generated some time after the Blood is born,
and that its parenchyma is produced by the Arteries, (which administer matter
to frame (...) and also that for a while it continues white, and without blood;
which is likewise common to other parts of the body. For after the same man^^
and order, as we have declared the production ^^ the Chicken to be out of the
Egg, does the (...) ration of Man, and all other Animals proceed. By which it
appears, how incongruous their persuasion is, (though it has obtained both of
old, and now too) who decree the Liver to be both the (...) where the Blood is
wrought, and the Author of it; and do upon that account, rank it amongst the
^hiefe and firstborn parts of the Body: who also give so much renown to this
Viscus, that they proclaim it to spring with the Heart, from the first
beginning, out of the semen of the mother; and do rigorously maintain the Fable
de tribus Capellis, or the three imaginary Bubbles. In which Quire, Parisanus
of late, with a loud, but unmannageable voice, has sung his part of the Catch.

These honest men never took notice, that the Vesicles move, the Heart pants,
and the Blood is now perfectly concocted, before any track or foundation of the
Liver appears. Without all question the Blood is to be counted the Author of
the Liver, ^ither then the Liver the Author of the Blood. For the Liver is made
after the Blood, and of it, cleaving ^the Veins that contain the Blood.

Nor yet can I subscribe to the Aristotelians, which repute the Heart to be the
Author of the ^^id. For its substance also, or Parenchyma is born (...) the
Blood, and is then superadded to the Ve^^^^la Pulsantes. But I am much in doubt
whether Vesicula, or Punctum saliens or the Blood, that is to ^y, whether the
contained liquor, or the containing ^^ssels be the elder. Now it seems in
reason, that ^^ container is made for the contained; and therefore after it.
This indeed our cies can truly witnese, ^^^ the Veins are the first woof, and
the first visi^^ foundation of the body, and that all the other (...) are
superadden to them, and born after (...). But of this matter hereafter more at
large.

In the Interim we cannot choose but smile at that fond and fictitious Division
of the Parts, into Spermatical, and Sanguineous; as if any part were
immediately framed of the Semen, and were not all of one extract and original.

But I return to our purpose. The extent of the Colliquamentum does not reach
over more then half the Egg. The Heart hanging out, stands something off from
the body. And if you makes diligent inspection, you may discover some of the
Umbilical Vessels beat.

The sixth Inspection of the Egg.
EXER. XX.
ON the seventh day all things are clearer, and the primordia of each
particular part are now visible; namely, the Wings, Legs, Genitals, the
divided Claws of the feet, the Thighs, the Sides^ien, etc.

Now the Foetus bestirrs it self, and kicks, and the Chicken is found complete,
there being no addition to be expected after but only the growth o^ the parts
yet tender: which the more they increase, the more the White decaies; and the
out ward membranes uniting, supply the place of the Secundina, or afterbirth;
as also the Veins do every day more and more represent the Navel. Therefore I
conceive it convenient to pass from the Seventh, to the Tenth day, because
nothing worth observation does intervene in the mo^^ time, though Authors
usually, especially Aristotle do not do so.

Notwithstanding all this, if you observe many Eggs at a time, you shall find
some that are forward, and better grown, have all the parts apparent in them;
other Truants will present them Iess distinct. Though on the other side, many
things concur to the work, as the Season of the year, the warmth of the Nest,
Outward cherishings, Deligent Incubation, and the like. I remember I have
sometimes seen in a sluggish Egg, the cavity indeed dilated on the seventh
day, and the Colliquamentum sprinkled ore with veins, also a Magot in the
midst of it, together with the rudiments of the Eyes, and other things which
come to pass in other Eggs, about the fourth or fifth day; yet there were no
vesiculae pulsantes at all: nor could I find the Trunk or root out of which
the Veins rise. And therefore I justly counted it a seeble backward Egg,
endowed but with a sickly generative power, and now upon the point to die. And
that chiefly, because its Colliquamentum was more clear and refulgent then
usual, and the veins did also shine a little. For when the Vital spirit
departs, that part first declines and corrupts, which is first in order of
Generation.

The Inspection after the tenth day.
EXER. XXI.
WHatever is visible the tenth day, is delivered so accurately by Aristotle,
that little or nothing remains to be added. And this opinion, according to my
Paraphrase, is thus: The tenth day all the Chicken is visible; and all
pellucid, and white, save only the Eyes and divarications of the Veins. And
the Head is bigger then all the rest of the body besides; and the Eyes stick
fast in the Head, or rather stick to the Head as Appendixes, being yet
unfurnished of a Pupilla or Eye-ball; (that is, having none yet perfectly
formed; and yet it is no hard matter to discover the distinct coats or
membranes) for if then you pluck them out, you shall find them black, and
bigger then Beans: from which if you take off the skin, there flows a white,
cold humor, very refulgent if you hold it in the light, and beside that humor,
there is nothing (namely in the whole entire Head) contained at all. And this
is the state of these parts, from the seventh day, to the tenth.

At the same time (says Aristotle) the Viscera or Intrals also appear, and all
the appurtenances belonging to the Belly and Guts; namely, the Parenchyma of
the Heart, Lungs, and Liver, etc. but all are white, mucilaginous, and washy,
and have no firm consistence in them. And the Veins also that proceed from the
Heart, are applied to the Navel. And from the Navel one Vein passes to the
membrane containing the yolke; which is then more liquid and dissolved, then
his natural constitution uses to be. But the other, to the other membrane,
which contains the whole membrane (namely the coat of the Colliquamentum)
which encompasseth the Foetus, and the Yolke, and the interjacent humor. For
while the Chicken grows by degrees, part of the yolk is above, and part below;
but the White being in the midst, is liquid. And the white is also under that
lower part of the yolke, as it was under it before. So far Aristotle.

And now you may plainly see the Veins accompany the Arteries; as well those
which (...) to the Whites, as those which pass to the yolk. The yolke also now
dissolves, and yet not all of it, but that which lies uppermost: nor do the
spriggs of the Veins run through the whole yolk, but through that part only
which we have said to be like melted wax. So also the Veins which tend to the
White, have some Arteries for their companions. And the greater part of the
White it self, is dissolved also into that white moisture (called the
Colliquamentum) which surrounds the Chicken swimming in the midst of it, and
lies between the two divisions of the yolke; namely, the Upper, and the Lower:
under which (in the acute angle of the Egg) the grosser and more viscous part
of the White remains. The Upper part of the yolke appears now more liquid
and resolved, then the Inferior does; for wheresoever the fibers of the Veins
disseminate themselves, the parts grow presently tumid, and softer.

But Aristotle adds, saying, the White at the tenth day sinketh down, being now
grown less, viscous, thicker, and yellowish; namely that part of it which is
not transformed into the Colliquamentum.

Now the greatest part of the White is resolved into the Colliquamentum, and
the Foetus; that is, all the thinner part of the Albumen, and the greater part
also of the thicker.

But the Yolk appears now larger, then it was at first. By which it is evident,
that the Yolk does not yet serve for nutrition, but is afterward designed for
that office. And as far as I could conjecture, by the disseminations and
distributions of the Veins, the Foetus is at first nourished by the
Colliquamentum; for the Veins are first distributed into it alone, and thence
into the membrane of the thinner White; and after that, into the grosser White,
and Yolk: so that even the grosser White becomes the nutriment, before the
Yolk. For the most tender Foetus, whilst it is yet a small Magot, is fed with
the thinnest diet of best concoction; that is, the Colliquamentum, and the
thinner White. But when it grows more hearty, it is received with entertainment
proper for its age and strength.

In the next words, Aristotle describes the situation of the particulars
contained in the egg. At the upper and lower end of the egg, does the
membrane of the egg reside, not the membrane which belongs to the shell, but
under it: and in that membrane is contained the white liquor: (namely the
Colliquamentum) then the Chicken, and the membrane containing it, which
provides such a separation, that the Foetus it self does not wallow in the
liquor.

Where I suspect a fault in the Text. For the thing it self speaks, that it
should be rather thus. Then the Chicken encompassed in a Membrane, is seated,
or swims in that white liquor; which Membrane is not that exterior one, which
immediately lineth the shell, but another Membrane, lying under that: which
when the exterior White is spent, and the remaining thicker White is depressed
into the Acute Angle, of two Membranes (namely, that of the thinner White, and
that which is proper to the Colliquamentum) is made one coat, which begins to
appear like the Secundine, called Chorion. Yet Aristotle says well, In that
Membrane is contained the white liquor: for by that he does not understand the
Albumen, but the Colliquamentum made of that Albumen, in which the Foetus
swims; for the remainder of the Albumen is now sunk down into the Acute Angle.

The Inspection after the fourteenth day.
EXERCIT. XXII.
From the seventh to the fourteenth day, all parts are enlarged (as has been
said) and more visible. The Heart and all the other Intrals are now concealed
in the several Venters or Bellies of the Chicken: and those that before were
exposed, and naked, cannot now be seen, but by opening the breast, and lower
belly. Now is the Chicken clothed in Plumes, whose roots appear, like black
points. The Apple of the Eye is now distinct, and the Eyelids are plain to be
seen: likewise the Membrana Nictatoria, or membrane moving the Eyelid, is
visible in the greater Canthus or corner of the Eye, which is a membrane
peculiar to all birds, by which they cleanse their Eyes. Also now the Gyri or
Involutions of the brain are distinguished, and the After-braine is covered by
the Scull: and the Tail has attained the form of a Rump.

After the fourteenth day, the Intrals (which were white before) put on by
degrees a ruddy flesh-colors. The Heart now entered into the cavernes of the
Chest, and being guarded by the Sternum, or Brestbone, enjoyes the habitation
which himself has erected. The Brain and After-braine grow firm and solid in
the Arch of the Cranium or Scull. But the Guts and Gisard, are not concluded in
the Abdomen, but hang out, being continued and fastened to the rest of the
Intrals.

One of the two Vessels which are derived to the Navel from the Belly near the
Fundament, is an Artery (as the Pulse discovers) springing from the Great
Artery: the other is a Vein, conveyed from the Yolk by the Guts into the
Vena Porta, or Gatevein, at the concavous part of the Liver: for the other
Trunck of the Umbilical vessels having received its branches from the White,
passes by the unequal part of the Liver, and is inserted into the Vena Cava, or
Hollow vein, near the basis of the Heart.

As these parts grow daily more conspicuous, so the greater portion of the
White is daily consumed; but it is not so with the Yolk, which is hitherto
almost entire, and of the same bulk it was the first day.

In the subsequent days, you may see the five Umbilical vessels, whereof one
is a very large vein, arising from the Hollow vein above the Liver, and
scattering branches into the White: the other two veins derived from the
Gate-veine (having both the same original) are disseminated into the two parts
of the Yolk; (which we have before described) and have two small Arteries which
arise from the Arteries of the loins, accompanying them.

The Chicken does now possess a greater room in the egg, then all the other
things contained in it: and begins to be down-feathered; and the larger the
Chicken grows, the more the White diminishes. And it is worth the
observation, that the membrane of the Colliquamentum, which were have said is
joined with the outward coat, and with it does constitute the Secundine, or
Chorion) does now likewise contain all the Yolk, and being grown more
contract, does convey the Yolk together with the Guts to the Foetus, and fasten
them to it, and shut them up like a purse, where the strings are drawn
together. And though it was subtle, and transparent before, yet now as it
grows more contract, so it thickens, and becomes more fleshy: and at length,
like a Hernia intestinalis in the scrotum or Cods dilated, it covers the Guts
together with the Yolk, and sustaineth them all: till at last growing narrower
by continual contraction, it constitutes the Abdomen of the Chicken. You may
find the Yolk thus disposed between the Guts, the belly hanging looser about
the 1st day: and yet not so fast rooted, but that the Guts (as it happens in
the Hernia intestinalis) easily driven either backward into the belly, or
downward into the Scrotum, may be moved up and down together with the Yolk. I
have seen the Yolk in this manner fall from the belly of a Pigeon, which in the
summer time, had too hastily broke loose from the shell.

About this time the Chicken has a huge belly, as if it labored of a Hernia.
And now the Colliquamentum by degrees grows troubled and thick, being
altered, and diminished, (which was before in very great quantity) and the
Chicken lies brooding upon the Yolk. And in those days, before the Liver
attains a bloody complexion, or executes the of office the second concoction
(as they say) the Gall (which is separated by the virtue of the Liver, and is
an excrement of that second concoction, as is commonly thought) is now to be
seen, of a green color between the Lobes of the Liver. In the Cavity of the
Stomach there is a clear Liquor, having the very same consistence, color and
taste, with the Colliquamentum, in which the Foetus swam; which gliding down the
Guts changes its color by degrees, and is converted into Chyle; and at last
just such an excrement is discovered in the lower end of the Guts, as that
which the Chickens eject after they are hatched. When the Chickens are more
grown, you shall see the liquor concocted and coagulated in their Stomach: as
in Infants that feed on Milk, there is a thick substance, which turns into
Whey and Curds.

And now the White being almost spent, and a small quantity of the
Colliquamentum remaining, the Chicken for some days before exclusion, does no
longer swim, (but as we have said) lies brooding upon the Yolk; and rouling
himself up in a heap, his Head for the most part being nusled between his
right Leg and Wing, he is completely accoutered with Bill, Claws, Plumes,
and other furniture. He sometimes wakes, and sometimes sleeps, and stirring
himself, respires and cries. If you lay the Egg, to your Ear, you shall
plainly hear the chicken busling, kicking out his Legs, and according to
Aristotle, he will stare upon you, and in his manner cry and complain. If you
let it fall gently into warm water, it will swim, and the chicken within it,
being roused by the ambient heat, will bound and leap, and the egg (as is
said) will tumble up and down. And this is the experiment which women make to
prove the fruitful from the barren eggs, for the latter sink in the water. When
the White is now clean consumed, a little before exclusion, that other Navel
(which as we said is derived to the White) is obliterated and expunged, or as
Aristotle says, that Navel which is extended to the exterior Secundine, is
loosened from the Animal, and falls off. But that which is conveyed to the
Yolk, is knit to the small gut of the chicken.

The first Excrements that are found in the chicken, Hist. an. l. 6 c. 3.
are white and muddy, like the egge-shell softened and dissolved. And such also
are to be found out of the Foetus wrapped up in the Secundine. To which Aristotle
consents, saying, At that time the Chicken discharges much excrement to the
outward membrane. And a white excrement is discoverable, not only within, but
without the belly. But in process of time, when the exclusion of the Foetus
approathes nearer, the excrement grows greenish, like that which the chicken
ejects after exclusion. And you may also perceive in his craw, a part of the
Colliquamentum swallowed down, and in his Gisord a schiston, or coagulated
substance.

Nor is the complexion of the Liver hitherto either purple, or sanguine, but
declining from white to yellow, as the Livers of Fishes, yet the Lungs are
sanguine.

The Yolk is now concluded in the Abdomen between the Guts: and that not only
while the chicken remains in the egg, but also when he is excluded, when he
walks abroad with his Mother to seek his provision. By which it appears true,
which Aristotle so often repeats: That the yolk is intended for the Aliment of
the Chicken: for the yolk being shut up within him, the Chicken for the first
days after exclusion (till his Bill is confirmed and strong enough to divide
and prepare his meat, and his Stomach enabled to digest it) feeds upon it: so
that it carries some analogy and proportion to milk. Aristotle casts in his
suffrage with us, in the place so often recited. Much of the yolk Hist. an. l.
6. c. 3.
does now lie under the Chicken: which yolk at last decreases, and in process
of time, is all turned into the chicken it self, in whose bowels it is
contained: so that ten days after the chicken is excluded, if he be dissected,
you shall find even then some small remainder of the yolk adhering to his
Intestines. Nay I have found some Relics of the yolk after the thirtieth day.
And, if the argument be of force from the production of the Umbilical veins
(which we have showed to be terminated in the Vena Porta of the Liver, by one
or two Trunks) the Chicken is now nourished by Aliment attracted by the
Umbilical vessels from the yolk: in the same manner as he afterward is
sustained by the chyle drawn out of the Intestines by the Meseraike veins. For
the vessels on both sides are terminated at the Gate of the Liver, whither they
do alike convey the nourishment they draw; that we may not fly to the Vene
Lacteae in the Mesentery (which in feathered Creatures are no where to be found)

Give me leave to add something here, which I have tried often; That I might
the better discern the situation of the Foetus, and the Liquors after the
fourteenth day, to the very exclusion: (the greate^ part of the White being now
exhausted, and the yolk divided) I have boiled an egg till it grew hard, and
then pilling away the shell, and seeing the Situation of the Chicken, I found
both the remaining part of the White, and the two parts of the yolk (which as
we have said before, are divided by colliquation caused by the gentle warmth)
of the same consistence, color, taste, and other accidents, as any other stale
egg, thus ordered, i^ And upon this Experiment, I did much pondar whence it
should come to pass, that Improlifical Eggs should, from the adventitious heat
of a Sitting Hen, putrify, and stink; and yet no such in convenience befall
the Prolifical: But both their Liquors (though there be a Chicken in them to^,
and he also with some Pollution and Excrement) should be sound, wholesome, and
incorrupt; so that if you eat them in the dark after they are boiled, you
cannot distinguish them from eggs that are so prepared, which have never
undergon the Hens incubation.

Of the Exclusion, or Birth of the Chicken out of the Egg.
EXERCIT. XXIII.
THe Egg is (as we have said) a kind of an exposed Womb, and placed where the
Foetus i^ formed: for it executes the office of the Matrix, and shelters the
Chicken till its just time of Birth: who when he is perfect, is born from
thence. Oviparous creatures are therefore not distinguished from Viviparous, in
this, that these bring forth their Foetus live, but they do not; (for the
Chicken in the Egg does not only live and move, but does breath also, and
exercise a voice, and being born, enjoyes a perfecter life, then the issues of
other Animals) but their maine difference cons^^^ in the manner of Generation;
namely, in that Viviparous creatures continue their Womb within them, in which
the Foetus is fashioned, cherished, and completed: but Oviparous expose their
Egg or Matrix without: yet nevertheless they do ripen and cherish it as much
by Incubation, as if they did reserve it within their bowels.

For though the Mother do sometimes upon sundry occasions desers the Eggs, yet
her affection continues still with them, and making speedy returns, she
receives them in her tender bosom, for stereth, and diligently defends them.

But when the Chicken now covets the freer air, the Shell being parted, he
enters into the world, and this about the one and twentieth, or two and
twentieth day.

The Common mistake of Fabricius, and almost all others, concerning this
Exclusion or Nativity of the Chicken, must not be passed by. Read Fabricius
himself: The Chicken (says he) does want the free air before it wants meat,
because there is yet some aliment page 55.
residing within it: in which condition the Chicken being unable to break the
shell, in regard the shell is hard, and his hill soft, and also by reason of
the distance between them, his bill being sheltered under his wing he gives his
mother a sign, by which he signif^^ the necessity he stands in to have it
broke up, and this s^^ne he utters by his cry. For the Chicken is at that
time solusty, and the cavity so enlarged, and so great a quantity of air
contained within it, that his restorations being large, can send forth an
exsufflation, and cry proper to his kind, and probably such a one as does
express his request; which also the standers by may easily hear: and this do
both Pliny and Aristotle mutually affirm. Which clamor of the Chicken coming

to the Hens care, and she finding a necessity of breaking the shell, that
her darling may enjoy the fr^^^ air to continue its life; or, if you will, she
being affected with a strong desire to see her beloved Infan^ breaks up the
egg with her bill; which is no hard matter to do, since in that place, by
reason the cavity has been long destitute of liquor, and has been much dried
by the air within it, and the heat without it, (...) shell is become more
frail, and brittle. The cry therefore of the Chicken, is the first and
greatest taken of desire of enlargement, and of the oxigence it stands in ^^ant
of Air: Which the Hen so exactly understands, that if it so fall out, that
she perceive the ^^^ckens cry to be low, and inward, then she turns ^^ egg up
side down with her feet; that she may cleave ^^ egg just in that place from
whence the voice comes, ^^out any injury to the chicken. Hippocrates ad^^ L. de
not. puer.
another token of the Chickens inclination to get out (...) shell; namely, that
the Chicken being now strait^^ for want of sustenance, bestirres himself
strongly, ^^quest of better feeding; and that the Membranes ^^ow every where
torn a sunder; and that the Mo^^ discovering these violent Motions of her
young, ^^ratching holes in the Shell, delivers it from bon^^e.

Thus far Fabricius, pleasantly and elegantly: this arguments are not well
bottomed. For ^^e found by Experience, that the Chicken it ^^ (and not the
Hen) does break up the Shell: ^^ this is also most consonant to Reason. For
^^ could the eggs which are fostered in Stoves ^^ Ovens (as it is in Egypt
and elsewhere) be o^^^^wise broken up? Where there is no Mother to ^^ the
distressed supplicants, nor redress their brings. And so how can the eggs of
your Land ^^ea-Tortises, your fishes, silkwormes, vipers, and ^^bes be unlockt,
when either the Issues them^^ are mute and silent, or else lie hid under and,
quite out of hearing. Chickens therefore born by themselves, and break loose
from ^^ eggs by their own industry. And this I ^^prove by infallible
Arguments. For in the ^^rforation of the Shell, the gap is so little, ^ it bears
no proportion at all with the Bill of (...), but exactly answers the chickens;
and ^^d about the hole (in manner of a coronet) the Shell stands up in
splinters, being always pierced at the same distance from the top: and the
shivered pieces (especially if the breach be new made) always jets out erect,
and tufted. And as when Glass-Windowes are broken, a man may easily discover
whether they were burst from within, or without; if he do but take the pains
to compare the bent and inclination of the fragments remaining: So also when
the egg is pierced, by the erection of the splinters all along the circuit of
the Coronet, it is manifest that the invasion came from within. And I my self,
and many more with me, when we have heard the Chicken grate and scrape the
Shell with his Claws, have presently seen it bored with his Bill, and a
circular breach forced through it in the manner of a coronet. I have also seen
the chicken bear up the top of the Shell with his Head, and so shake it off. We
have been something large in this subject, because the speculation is not to be
contemned: as will appear hereafter. But as for Fabricius, he is easily
answered: For I grant the chicken has a voice in the Egg, and perhaps a
significant petitory voice: But it does not thence follow that the Hen breaks
the Shell, nor that the chickens Bill is so soft, and at so great a distance,
that it cannot penetrate the Shell; especially since the Shell, according to
his own arguments, is now very brittle. Nor does the chicken always confine
his Head to his Wing, that so he may be made incapable of working his passage,
but then only when he is asleep, or else has given up the Ghost For sometimes,
as Fabricius confesses, he wake kickes, scrapes, soratches, strains the
Shell, straggles, tears the membranes that enwrap him, (...) (and that he
implores help by these cries, ^^ do not withstand it) and all these actions
may any man hear, that has a mind to it. Wherefore the Hen diligently
listening, so soon as she discovers the voice to be remote, and come from
below, she does not burst the egg, but gently move it to and fro with her
foot, till she have procured a more commodious situation for the prisoner.
Yet it does no way appear, that the Pullus does by his cry signify the
necessity of his release from the Shell to his Mother, or desire an enlargement
of her procuring, for you may often times, even for two days together before
exclusion hear him cry in the Shell. Nor does the Hen by the several removes
of the egg, seek a convenient place to break it up: but as when the sick
Infant in the cradle is disquiet, weeps, and roares, his affectionate Mother
turns him from side to side, and rocks him till he lie at ease: so likewise
the Hen, when she finds her chicken bufling, or crying in the egg: or after
his exclusion tumbling up and down in a distempered posture: she presently
^arts up, and provides that the weight or heat of her body may not offend him,
and moves him from place to place with her Claws and Bill, till he have
procured his ease and quiet.

Of Twinne-Egges.
EXERCIT. XXIV.
THey are called Ova Gemellifica, or Twin-Egges, de hist. an. l. 6. c. 2.
which bring two chickens; being (as Aristotle (...)) Stocked with two yolks,
which in some are divided with a slender partition of White, to preserve them
from confusion: but in others there is no White at all, but the yolks are
contiguous.

I have often seen these Ova Gemellifica or Twin-Egges, where they have had two
Whites to every yolk, together with common, and proper membranes respectively
embracing them. And I have again seen other eggs where the two yolks did
cleave to one another, and were both encompassed with one single Common White.

There are some Hens (says Aristotle) which bring none but Twinne-Egges, in
which the Yolke is clearly disposed, as we said before: for a certain Hen in
Ibid.
two and twenty eggs, laid none but Twinne-Egges; except only those that
were barren. Now it comes to pass, that one of the Twins is bigger then the
other: but the last is a Monster.

With us sometimes there are Twin-Egges, and the Chickens also are sometimes
Twins too, though very seldom. And for my part I never saw two such Chickens
that both of them lived: but one perished either in the egg it self, or in the
Exclusion. And this also seems to have befalne Aristotle's Chickens, because he
says, One was bigger then the other: implying that one of them was hartier
then the other, and sooner quickened: but the other weaker, and so less ready to
endure exclusion: For (I am persuaded that) the two Yolks are of different
production, and maturity. And therefore it can hardly be, but that the
forwarder Chicken, being now ripe for enlargement, in breaking up the egg, to
make way for his own nativity, must needs induce abortion to his brother: And
should he forbear to break up the egg, his own life were in imminent danger,
being now straightened for breath. So that in Exclusion, the one or the other,
receives their inevitable doom.

Fabricius either not observing, or not understanding page 29.
those words of Aristotle, says: If there chance to be such an egg that has
two yolks in it, the Chicken that is produced thence, is born with four legs,
and four wings, and two heads, and so becomes a kind of Monster: but the
Chickens never come forth so distinctly two: (as that they may truly be called
two) but have only one main Trunk of body, where two heads, and four legs and
the like are adjoined.

Whence it appears, that himself never saw, nor heard by others that had seen
it, that such kind of Eggs produce Twins: and therefore he must needs be of my
mind; namely, that such eggs rarely happen; and that they never exclude two
vital Foetuses. Yet I cannot but admire that (if he saw this place of
Aristotle) he should say, that such an egg does never produce two distinct
Chickens, but always a Monster: especially since he believes, that the Foetus
is formed of the Chalazae, as out of the subject Matter, and he could not but
see four chalazae in every Gemellifical Egg. I rather believe that when in a
Gemellifical Egg there are two Yolks concluded in the same White, and are so
conjoined together, that their cicatriculae, while they are opened together, do
constitute one Eye (which we call the colliquamentum) a Monster chicken may be
then produced, having four Legs, two Heads, (...). because I can see nothing to
hinder it; and such a one I suppose was bred of Fabricius his Egg.

Yet nevertheless, where the two yolks are distinct, and separate by their
proper Coats, and are furnished with their Grandines, and Whites, and other
necessaries conducing to the Generation of the Foetus: I conceive we ought to
conclude with Aristotle, that such an egg as it has all the parts required to
two eggs (save only the Shells) so it obtaines the virtue and power too; and
unless it be barren and addle, will for the most part produce two chickens, but
seldom a single Monster.

CERTAIN THEOREMS taken out of the foregoing History of the Egg.
EXERCIT. XXV.
THe History of the Hen-Egge, is such as has been said. Wherein we have
delivered how the Egg it self is generated, and how by its Action (which is
Propagation) it forms the chicken. All which, has perhaps been sufficiently
prolix, and tedious to such who are not yet acquainted, whither these so great
undertakings, and so exact and accurate Observations, tend. And therefore I
hold it convenient to discover what fruit and advantage may be reaped by my
labor: and hereupon (to use the expression of our most learned Verulamius) we
shall proceed to our Second Vintage: collecting certain Theorems out of our
former History; some of which are Infallibly True, some Doubtful, and must
submit to a farther Discussion: Some are Paradoxical, and contrary to the
received opinion: Some of them also relate to the Cock, or Male, some to the
Female; some, to the Egg it self; and lastly, some to the Formation of the
Pullus. Which when we have once thoroughly discussed, and understood, Our
knowledge and insight into the Generation of all other Animals, will be less
exposed to difficulty, and Error.

What an Egg is.
EXERCIT. XXVI.
THe Theorems, which are employed about the Contemplation of the Egg, some do
teach what an Egg is, some what its Generation, and others what Parts go to
its Constitution.

And first it is evident, that One Chicken proceeds but from one Egg: which
though it be a One Chicken proceeds but from One Egg.
kind of an exposed Womb, yet it seldom produces more Chickens then One. And
though sometimes it produce two, yet that egg is not to be accounted a single,
but a double egg; as having obtained both the Nature and Parts of two eggs.

For the egg is a certain Conception proceeding from Male and Female,
qualified with the An egg is a Conception.
power of both: and out of it being One, one Animal is constituted.

Nor is it the Beginning, but the Fruit also, and the End; Namely, the
Principium, the Beginning Both the Beginning and the Fruit.
or Principle of the Offspring, that is to be generated; but the Fructus, the
Fruit of Both Parents; namely, the Cocks and the Hens Work (or End, which they
proposed to themselves in Generation) and the Original of the future foetus.
Now, the De genesis an. l. 1. c. 18.
Seed and the Fruit (according to Aristotle) are distinguished from one
another, under the notion of For^ar, and Latter: for the Fruit is that which is
made ^ut of another, and the Seed is that out of which another is made; for
otherwise they were both the same.

The Egg also seems to be a kind of Medium; It is also a certain Medium.
not only as it is the Principium, and the Finis, but as it is the Common work
or production of both Sexes, and compounded of both: which containing in it
self the Matter, and the Efficient or Operative Faculty, it has the power of
both, by which he produces a Foetus like to One, or the Other. It is also a
Medium, or thing between an Animate and ^n Inanimate creature; being neither
absolutely empowered with life, nor absolutely without it. It is a Midway or
Passage between the Parents and the Children; between those that were, and
those that are to come, and the very Hinge and Center about which the
Generation of all the Race and Family of Cocks and Hens does move, and
depend. It is the Terminus a quo, the Point or Original from which all the
Cocks and Hens in the world do arise and spring: and it is also the Terminus
ad quem, the Aim and End proposed by nature, to which they direct themselves
all their life long. By which it comes to pass, that all Individuals, while to
supply their Species they beget their Like, do continue and perpetuate their
duration. The Egg is at were the Period of this Eternity; for it is hard to
say, Whether the Egg be made for the Chickens sake, or the Chicken for the
Eggs. Now, which of these two, namely the Egg or the Hen, have the priority
in Nature, or Time, we shall now copiously handle, when we come to discourse of
the Generation of all Animals in general.

The Egg also (which is chiefly to be noted It is also the Sperma.
answers in proportion to the Seeds of Plants, and has obtained the same
qualifications with them, so that it may justly be styled the Sperma, and
Semen, or Seed of the Hens (as also the Seeds of Plants may be rightly called
Ova Plantarum, the Plants Eggs) not only ex quo, out of which, as out of a
subject Matter; but also a quo, by which, as by an Efficient cause, the Chicken
springs. In which also there is no part of the Future Foetus, actually (...)
it, but yet all the parts of it are in it potentially.

Now, Semen, or Seed properly so called, does differ from Genitura, Geniture,
because (according Ibid. The difference between Sperma and Genitura.
to Aristotle's definition) That is called Genitura, which proceeding from the
Male-Parent, is the chief and principle cause of Generation; namely, in f^ll as
nature has designed to coition; but the semen is that, which proceeds from
both Parents in the act of coition, the Seed of all Plants is like to this, and
so is the Seed of some Animals, which have no distinction of Sex at all, being
as it were at the first a kind of mixture of both Sexes, or promiscuous
conception, or Animal: for these kind of creatures have in their single selves,
as much as is required of both Sexes.

An Egg therefore is a Natural Body endowed with an Animal power: namely, with
a Principle of Motion, Transmutation, Rest, and Conservation. And lastly, it is
such a thing, as all impediments being removed, it will pass into an Animal:
not do heavy bodies, when all obstacles are out of their way, tend downward
more naturally; then Seed, and the egg, do by an inbred Natural Propensity
incline to become a Plant, or an Animal. And the Seed also, and the Egg, are
the Fr^^ and End, of that very thing, whose Beginning and Efficient they are.

Of One Chicken there is but One Egg: So Aristotle, Of One Seed is begotten
One Body; as for example, Genesis an. l. 1. c. 20.
of One Grain of Wheat, One Ear; of One Egg, one Animal; for a Twinne-egge
is Two Eggs.

And so Fabricius says, Truly: An egg is not only an exposed Uterus, and
place of Generation, but the very thing also on which the entire Generation of
the Chicken depends; which the egg accomplisheth, both as Agent, as Matter, as
the Place, as the Instrument, and all other things, whatsoever are necessary
requisites to Generation. He proves it to be in Organum, or Instrument, because
it consists of several parts, and that according to Galen, who requires page 47.
this to the very being of an Instrument, that it be composed of diverse
particles, which conspire all to one (...), but under several capacities, and
for several uses: for some of these parts are the chief Agent in the Action;
some are necessary Assistants, without which the Action could not be performed
at all; others conduce to the more convenient and better performance; and
lastly, some again, to the welfare and preservation of all the rest. And he
also proves it to be an Agent, where he propounds out of Aristotle and Galen,
the two actions of the Egg; namely, the Generation, and Augmentation, and
Nutrition of the Chicken. And lastly, he says exceeding well, when he affirms,
that in the Operations of Nature, the Artificer or Agent, the Instrument, and
the Matter are one and the same thing: So the Liver is both the Efficient, and
the Instrument of sanguification: and so the other parts of the body: wherefore
Aristotle was in the right, saying, It is hard to distinguish the Agents from
the Instruments. In artificial Operations de genesis an. l. 2. c. 4.
indeed the Agent and the Instrument are divided, as the Smith and his Hammer,
the Painter and his P^^cil. And the reason is rendered by Galen, becau^^ in
artificial Operations, the Artificer is without 1. de form. Foet.
Work; but in Natural the Efficient cause is include in the Instruments, and
received with intimacy in the very substance of the Organ. To which I ad^ those
Perspicuous passages of Aristotle, Of thing that are, some are caused by
nature, and some by other causes: by Nature do Animals, and their Parts Phys.
l. 1. e. 1.
also Plants, and simple bodies, as the Earth, Fire, (...) and Water, consist:
For these and the like, we s^^ are made by Nature. Now all these forenamed
creatures seem to be differenced from those which are not made by Nature. For
all those things that (...) made by Nature, seem to have in themselves a
Principle of Motion, and Rest; some in relation to place some in relation to
increase and diminution, and s^^, in relation to alteration. Now a
Horse-Litter, and Garment, and all such kind of things, according to their
several notions, as far forth as they are the products of Art, they have no
inbred principle of Mutation: but so far as it chances, that they are framed of
Stone, or Earth, or bodies composed of these, so far they have one. As if
Nature were a certain principle and cause, why that thing does move, and rest,
in which it first is, of it self, and not by Accident. Now I say, not by
Accident; because it may come to pass that a man may be the cause of his own
health, in case he be a Physician: Yet he is not in health under the same
Respect, as he is a Physician; but it is a men Accident, that the same Man
should be in Health, and a Physician too. And therefore these two things are
sometimes apart. And thus it is in all other artificial things: for none of
them have in themselves an Efficient Principle, but some of them have such a
Principle in others, that are without themselves, as a House and all other
Manual Productions: some indeed have it in themselves, but not by themselves:
namely, all those things which may by accident become causes to themselves.
Nature therefore is that thing which she has ^^eady been said to be. And all
those things have nature in them, which have such a kind of Principle. And all
those things are substances. For Nature is ever ^^me subject, and in some
subject.

We have related these Passages more at large, The Efficient Cause of
Generation is in the Egg.
and in their Authors own words; that so it may appear, that what we attribute
to the egg, is ^^ally in it; namely, the Matter, the Organ, the ^^fficient
Cause, Place, and what ever else is required to the Generation of the Pullus.
And chiefly, for the clearing of some most difficult questions, (...) namely,
which is, and what kind of Principle it is, from whence Motion and Generation
do pro^^d? Also, by what Power the Seed does act, according to Aristotle? And
lastly, what it is that ^oth inspire and qualify the Seed with its faecundity?
(For Aristotle decrees, that Nature is the Principle of Motion and Rest, Innate
in all bodies, ^^d not Accidental.) Whether that which in the ^gge, is the
Cause Efficient, and Principle of Generation, and of the Vegetative and Vital
Operations, be some Innate thing in it, or something Added to it? And whether
it be in it first, and by it self, as a kind of Nature: or else by Accident,
as the Physician is in the Cure? Whether it be some In^^ed, or some Acquired
power which does transform the Egg into a Chicken; or nourish it when it was
but begun in the Ovary, augmenting, and perfecting, also preserving it while it
is not Set upon by the Hen.

Moreover, what it is that fructifies the egg, whether it be to be called the
Soul? or a Part of the Soul? or some faculty of the Soul? or some thing that
has a Soul? or an Intellect? or la^^ the Deity? because it acts for some end,
(...) disposes all things by providence, and (...) mitable art, and after an
incomprehen^^^ manner; and always provides what is best, b^^^ for the being,
and well-being; as also for defense, and ornament. And this not only in
perfect egg which it fructifies, but even in a subventaneous one too,
nourishing, augmenting, and preserving it. And does not only supply and
nourish the yolk in the Vitellary, but that very le^^ speck (whence that
proceeds) being of no grea^^ magnitude then Millet, or Mustard Seed, which i^
feeds and enlarges; and at last invests it with the White, the Chalazae, the
Membranes, and the Shall For it is probable, that even an Improlifical, barr^^
egg^, by an innate and inbred principle (though it be contained in the Bowels
of the Hen, and adhear to her) does feed, conserve, augment, alter (in like
manner as Fishes and Frogs-egges, which being exposed do grow, and are
perfected) and transform it self out of a small Whelke or spe^k into a yolk,
and afterward take its journey from the Ovary to the Uterus (though it have no
Connection to the Uterus) and there inrobe it self in the White; and at last
complete it self with the Membranes, Chalazae, and Shel.

But be it what it will, which does alike both in a Subventaneous, and in a
Fruitful, equally produce the same effects, after the same manner, and from the
same Causes or Principles; whether it be the same Soul, or the same Part of the
Soul; in both it is very well worth our inquiry. Now in probability, the same
things do spring from the same Causes.

Though the egg while it is making, is contained within the Hen, and grows
to its parent in Whether the Egg be a Part of the Hen?
(...) Vitellary by the Pedunculus or stalk, and is supplied from the Hens
veins: yet may it not be said to be a Part of its mother, nor to take life and
^^getation from her soul, but from its own proper power, and intrinsecal
principle: As Mush^^s, Misletoe, and several kinds of Moss are bred (...) of
Trees, (which though they adhere to the ^lant, and are sustained by the same
sap with its ^wn blossoms, and leaves, yet are they not Parts of those Trees,
nor are they called so. Aristotle to salve these doubts, allows a Vegetative
soul to de genesis an. l. 3. c
^e, even in the very Subventaneous Egg, where he says, Both Females, and all
things that live, have a Vegetative soul, as has been often said: Wherefore
this ^gge (treating of a Subventaneous egg) considered a^ the Conception of a
Plant, is perfect, of an Animal, it is Imperfect. And in another place he
teaches the same thing, enquiring: After what manner de genesis an. l. 2. c. 4.
^^ Subventaneous eggs said to live? for they cannot be said to live as
fruitful eggs live: For then an Animal might be produced out of them. Nor are
they in the condition of Wood, and Stones; because they perish by a kind of
corruption, as things that formerly did in some sort partake of life. It is
certain therefore that they have some Potential soul: But what Soul is that?
doubtless that Soul which they last enjoyed, which is a vegetable Soul; for
this is indifferently in all Plants as well as Animals.

And yet the same soul is not in Subventaneous Eggs, and in fruitful. For if
so, A Chicken might alike be formed out of both. But how their Souls differ,
and in what, Aristotle does not sufficiently declare, in his enquiry, Why all
the parts of an egg are framed in a Subventaneous Egg, and yet an Animal is
not procreated thence? Because (says he) it is necessary it should have a
sensative soul. As if in fruitful Eggs there were a sensative soul, besides
the vegetative. Unless you apprehend it thus, that the Vegetative soul is
Actually in a fruitful egg, which contains in it a sensative soul, in
Potentia; out of which afterward an Animal, and the sensative parts of an
Animal are produced. But this does not sufficiently salve the scruple, not
release the mind involved in perplexities and doubts. For an Egg seems to be
the true Sper^^ of an Animal, according to that of Aristotle. In those things
that have life, and no distinction of Sexes, de genesis an. l. 1. c. 20.
the Seed is a kind of Conception already. I call that a Conception (which
bears proportion to Seed) which is the mixture of Male and Female; wherefore
out of (...) Seed proceeds one Body, v. g. out of one egg (...) Animal.

One egg therefore seems to have one Soul: now What soul is that wherewith
the Egg is informed.
whether is that Soul the soul of the Hen? or of the Cock? or a mixed soul of
Both? For the doubt chiefly concerns those eggs, which proceed from Animals of
a distinct kind: as out of a dunghill Hen, and a Cock Pheasant. I enquire
whether such an egg participate of the soul of the Hen, or of the Pheasant?
or is the soul of the Egg compounded of them both? But how can there be a
commixture of souls, if (according to Aristotle) the soul (as being the form)
be an Act, and a Substance. For no man can deny, but that that thing whatsoever
it be, which is the Principle and Cause of those Effects which we see produced
in a Fertile Egg, is a substance susceptible of diverse powers, forces, and
faculties, as also of several conditions, virtues, vices, health, and
sickness. For some Eggs are longer lived then others: and some do procreate
Chickens endowed with the virtues, and soundness of constitution of the
parents; and others produce them inclinable to distempers. Nor can we for this
inconvenience accuse the Matter, out of which they are generated, since the
diseases of the Male are sometimes transferred to the Chickens; who is not
concerned any thing at all in the Matter of the egg. For from the Male the
Plastical and Generative faculty only does proceed, which renders the egg
fertile, but does constitute no part of it. For the Geniture which is emitted
from the Male in Coition, does not enter into the Matrix: (where the Egg is
formed) Nor (as we have said before, and Fabricius also joins in the Suffrage)
can it any way penetrate those recesses, and much less the Ovary, which is
seated near the Precincture, or Midriffe of the body, that so it might
communicate any portion of the Matter, or any thing at all besides its single
Virtue. For constant experience testifies, that one and the same act of Coition
does fructify many eggs together: and not only those that are existent in
the Uterus and the Ovary; but those also that are not yet begun: as we shall
declare hereafter, and have already proved in our History.

If therefore the Egg be rendered Fertile from its own proper soul, or be
endowed with an innate The Egg does not live by the Soul of the Hen.
fructifying principle of its own; by which either a dunghill Chicken, or a
mongrel-issue between the dunghil-Henne, and the Cock-Pheasant does arise; and
that either Male, or Female, like the Male, or Female-Parent, sound, or sickly;
we must then conclude, that the Egg (even while it is contained in the Ovary)
does not live by the Soul of the ^^^ne; but is a freeborn, Independent Issue
from (...) very first original: As the Acorne taken off from the Tree, and the
Seed from the Plant, are no longer to be counted parts of them; but creatures,
as it were, at their own dispose; living and subsisting, by an inbred
vegetative faculty peculiarly their own.

Now if we affirm that a Fertile Egg has a soul, a question will arise;
whether that self-same soul, be now at present in the Egg, and how after, in
the Chicken, or whether their souls be distinct. For we must of necessity
acknowledge, that some Principle there is which does constitute, and nourish
the egg; and also that there is a Principle which produces and sustaineth the
Chicken. The question therefore is, whether the Principle, or soul of the Egg
and Chicken, be one and the same, or more then one, and diverse? For if there
be more then one soul; (namely, one which belongs to the Egg, and another to
the Chicken) it will be farther enquired, whence, and at what time the Chickens
soul arrives to it? And what that is in the Egg, which dilates the Cicatricula
raises the Yolk to the top, and produces that Eye, (which we call the
Colliquamentum) alters the Constitution of the liquors, and does predispose all
things for the fabric and structure of the Chicken when as yet there is
nothing at all of the chicken existent? Whence also can we pretend that proper
and convenient Aliment is derived to ^^^ Chicken, to sustain and augment it,
when there i^ yet no Chicken at all? For these operations s^^ to belong to the
Vegetative soul of the Chicken, ^^ cause they relate to the Chickens use;
namely ^^ nutrition, and Augmentaetion. But now, when the fabric of the
Chicken is in hand, and half-perfected, what is it that makes the Foetus, One
^^ the same thing with the Liquors, conjoining the together by continuity, and
concrescence? What is it that feeds, and enlarges the Pullus; that does
vindicate those juices which are advantageous to its nourishment from
Putrefaction, preparing, melting down, and concocting them?

Since the soul is the Act of an Organical Body, which has life in Potentia,
it is an incredible thing that that soul should be in the Chicken before its
body have received any Organization. Nor yet can we believe that the soul of
the egg, and the chicken is one and the same: for the soul is the Preserver of
that thing only, whose soul it is; but the Puttus and the Egg, are two
distinct things; and do exercise not only distinct vital operations, but
Contrary; in so much that one of them seems to result from the Corruption of
the other. May we then say, that the Cause and Principle of life to them both
is one and the same? namely to the Chicken which is yet but an Embryo, and to
the rest of the Egg, as if it were the simple and single act of one and the
some body; or as if out of the parts constituting ^^^ natural body, one soul
did spring, which were all in the whole (as they say) and all in every part. As
we find in the Trunk, Leaves, and Fruits ^^^ Tree: in which, wheresoever we
make a separation or division (be it in what part it will) we say, that the
first Cause and Principle of that part, ^^ the same with that of the Whole, as
being the Form and End of the One, but the Principle only of the Other. For so
in a Line, in what point soever a division be made, it will be the End of the
^ore-going part, but the Beginning of the subsequent. And the same thing may
seem to befall in ^^lity, and Motion; namely, in every Transmutation, and
Generation.

And so much at present concerning these matters: which we shall more exactly,
and more copiously handle, when we treat in General of the Nature of the Soul
of the Foetus, of any Animal whatsoever; as also what it is? From whence, and
when it comes? What part it takes first possession of? and how it is all in the
Whole, and all in every part? And also how it is the same, and yet diverse? All
which we shall determine and resolve out of multiplied experiments.

That the Egg is not the Production of the Womb, but of the Soul.
EXER. XXVII.
AS we conclude (says Fabricius) the Action of the Stomach to be
Chylification; and the action page 8.
of the Testicles to be the Generation of Seed; because the Chyle is found in
the Stomach, and Seed in the Testicles: So we positively resolve, that the
Generation of Eggs is the action of the Uterus of the Foul, because the egg
is found resident there. So then we evidently know, and understand, which is
the Instrument and Place of the Generation of Eggs. But (...) again, since
there are two Wombs in a Foul, the Superior and Inferior, and those much
unlike one another, and therefore their Actions are diverse, yet it i^ apparent
which action is peculiar to each. For (...) Superior is ordained for the
Generation of the Yolk the Inferior of the White, and the other parts, ^^ the
whole, as is evident even to sense: For in the Superior nothing is contained
but a throng of Yolks, but the Inferior the entire perfect egg. And yet this
is not all the employment of the Womb; but the Augmentation of the egg, which
presently insueth after the egg is generated, and continues till it be
completed and have attained its just stature or magnitude, is also employed
herein. For a Hen does not naturally lay her egg till it be perfect, and have
its just proportion. The Action therefore of the Womb, is both the Generation
and Augmentation of the Egg. Now Augmentation includes and supposes
Nutrition. But since all Generation is effected by two; namely, the Agent, and
the Matter: The Agent in the procreation of Eggs is nothing else, but the
Instrument or proposed Organs, namely the twofold Uterus. But the Matter is
nothing else but Blood.

Now we, though we acknowledge the Action of the Uterus to be in some sort the
Generation of the Egg, yet we do not agree upon any terms in the world, that
the Egg is nourished and increased by the Uterus. And this both for the
reasons before alleged, when we discoursed concerning the soul of the Egg,
which nourishes it: and also because it is an improbable thing, that an
External Agent (as the Womb is, in regard of the Egg) should form, nourish,
and angment all the interior parts of the Egg, according to their several
dimensions: nay according to Aristotle, it is altogether de genesis an. l. 2. c. 1.
impossible. For how can an agent that is extrinsecal in respect of the
patient, work upon the Aliment that is elsewhere provided, and restore it into
the place of that which is wasted away, according to all dimensions; or how can
any thing be affected and altered by that, which does not touch it? Therefore
doubtless the same things befall the Generation of Eggs, as happen to the
exordiums of all living creatures; namely, that they should be constituted by
some preexistent external thing; but presently (upon the reception of life)
nourish, and augment themselves; and that by ^ proper inspired efficacy,
proceeding from a Principle which is now borne, and implanted in them.

What we have lately delivered concerning the soul, does seem to evince
clearly, that the Egg is neither the Workmanship of the Uterus, nor controuled
or governed by it: For it is apparent that even a Subventaneous egg is
furnished with a Vegetative Soul, because we discover even such an egg also to
enjoy Vegetation, Nutrition, Augmentation, and Conservation, which are
infallible sight of the foresaid Soul. Now these faculties cannot issue out of
the Mother, or Matrix, because the Egg has no Coherence, or Union to it; but
tumbles and roules in its Cavity free, and disjoined (like a Son who has
obtained his Freedom) and grows up to perfection, as the Seeds of Plants do in
the Womb of the Earth, by an internal Vegetative Principle, which can be no
less then a Vegetative Soul.

Much more will it appear, that it has a Soul, when we consider, after what
manner, and by whose impulsion, the Round and Ample Yolk, being new loose from
the Vitellary, makes its descent through the Infundibulum, (which is a slender
Tunnel, wrought with a niost thin membrane, which has no provision of motory
fibers) working out its own way, till through all those streights it arrive at
the Uterus; where it nourishes, augmenteth, and invests it self in the White.
And yet all this while, there is no Motory Instrument at all in the Vitellary,
which should expel it thence, nor in the Infundibulum, which should transmit
it, or in the Uterus which should attract it: Nor is the Egg fastened by veins
to the Uterus, as in the Ovary, nor has any dependence upon it by the
Umbilical Vessels; as Fabricius truly affirms, and is obvious to every eye.
What then remains, but that upon discovery of such wonderful Operations, we
should cry out with the Poet,

Spiritus intus alit, totamque infusa per artus 6. Aenead.

Men's agitat molem.
An innate Spirit feeds, an Infused Soul
Into each part, does the whole Mass control.
And though the first ground-workes of Eggs (which we have proved to be but
Whelkes, as it were, and of the magnitude of the Seed of Millet) do cohear to
the Vitellary by the mediation of Veins and Arteries; (as the Seeds of Plants
are born adhearing to the Plants) and thereupon seem to be Parts of the Hen,
and to be nourished and live after the manner of other Parts: yet it is
evident, that as the Seeds of Plants being dis-united from the Plants, are no
more accounted parts of them; no more are Eggs, now come to maturity, empowered
with fertility, and separated from the Vitellary, any longer to be ranked
amongst the Parts of the Hen, but like a Son come to age, and at his own
dispose, are regulated and enlivened by their own proper soul.

But of this morefully hearafter, when we shall discourse concerning the Soul
of an Embryo in general; and of the excellence and divinity of the Vegetative
Soul, ordering all things after a wonderful manner: (which providence, art, and
divine discretion, as far exceeding our capacity, as God excells Man; and
therefore are (confessed by all) truly admirable, not to be gazed upon by our
cloudy apprehensions, by reason of their ineffable luster.

What shall we say then of those little Animals, which are begotten in our own
bodies, which no man ever doubted to be regulated and vegetated by their own
proper soul? And of this kind are Worms in the Stomach, Guts, and Fundament,
Lice, Nittes, little Worms in the Flesh, Mites: Or what shall we resolve
concerning those Worms, which proceed from Plants, and their fruit? such as
you may find in Galls, Nuts, the Scarlet-Berry, and Eglantine, etc. For an
Animal may be created almost in all dry things, growing moist, or moist things
Hist. an. l. 5. c. 32
growing dry. It is impossible that those Animals which are bred in the Galls
should be enlivened by the Oaks soul, though they live joined to the Oak, and
provide their Aliment out of the Sap of the Oak. And so it is credible, that
the very Rudiments of the Eggs, while they are yet in the Cluster, do subsist
by their own, and not by the Hens Soul, though they are united to her by
Veins and Arteries, and she also do administer nourishment to them. For (as we
have observed in our History) the Whelkes do not all grow at once (as Grapes
grow in the Bunch, and Grains in the Ear of Corn) as if they were inspired
by the same concocting and formative faculty; but are increased one after
another; (as by their own efficacy) and that which first separates its self
from its fellows, changes color and consistence, and of a White Whelke is
made a Yolke; and so they follow one another in order: And which is more
remarkable, in Pigeons, and some other Birds, they grow up from the Cluster in
paires to make up one Laying, and one of them moves for the most part a Cock,
and the other a Hen. And yet in the mean time some of the Papulae, or Whelks
in the Ovary stay at a stand, till two other grow up for a new production,
which have received fecundity from the repeated coition of the Male, and are
both inspired with a Soul. Which when they have received, they order
themselves, and grow; living at their own, not at their Parents command. For
indeed what can you fancy to dispose, select, separate, and perfect these
Papulae, or Whelks (rather then the other) unless it be their own proper
souls. For though they assume nourishment from their Parent, yet they do it
no otherwise, then the Plants attract from the Earth, or the Foetus from the
Yolke and White.

Lastly, because the Papula continuing in the Ovary, receives its fecundity
from coition, and such a one too, that it by and by passes into the form of
the Cock concerned in the coition; (whether it be Dunghill-Cock, or
Cock-Pheasant) and since so great a difference befalls the Papulae, as there is
in the males themselves of different kind, what shall we conclude to be in the
Papulae themselves, by whose virtue they are distinguished both from
themselves, and their female parent? Doubtless it must needs be the soul, by
which they are diversified both from one another, and from their Mothers also.

And just in this manner do Mushromes, and Plants growing to Trees, live. We
discover likewise often in our own bodies, that Cancers, fleshy, and also
phlegmatical Tumors, and such like swellings, are supplied and fed as it were
with their own proper vegetative souls; while in the interim the true and
genuine parts of the Body, do extenuate and wither: And that because these
tumors do seduce all the aliment to themselves, and so defraud the rest of the
body of its fostering juice (as of its Genius) whence they are called
Phagedaenae and Lupi, Devouring Cankers and Wolves. And perhaps Hippocrates by
his (...), understood those diseases, which spring from venom, or contagion; as
if they were furnished with a life, or inspired with a certain divine
principle, by which they provide for themselves, and propagate their kind, and
so did beget by contagion distempers like themselves, in several person^.
Wherefore (Aristotle says) Animae plena sunt omnia, All things are filled with
a soul. And i^ De Genesis an. l. 3. c. 11. Ibid. l. 4. c. 11.
another place, he conceives that even Wind has its life, birth, and decease.
But the yolke, which it is now divorced from the Ovary, and spoiled of all
commerce with the Hen, then doubtless (a^ beans and such like pulse derive
of their own accord humidity from the Earth, which they imbibe, and digest)
passing through the Infundibulum, and residing now in the Cavity of the Uterus,
it does attract a slow thick moisture, which it receives into it self, and
from it obtains nutrition and augmentation, begirts it self with the White,
and being ingarrisoned in the membranes and the shell, is at last exact and
perfect. All which being duly considered, we conclude, that it is stored with
a peculiar soul of its own.

That the Egg is not made without a Hen.
EXERCIT. XXVIII.
TO omit what ever is in dispute; and to wave all controversies till we come to
the General contemplation concerning this subject; we now proceed to things of
more certainty, and more obvious.

And first it is manifest that an Egg cannot be made fertile, without the help
of the Cock and Hen. For without a Cock it cannot be fruitful, without a
Hen it cannot be at all. And this is opposite to that opinion, which deduceth
the first rise and fabric of all living creatures out of the clay of the
Earth. For since the several parts of Generation (namely the Testicles and
Leading Vessels in the Cock) are formed with such eminent Art, Industry, and
Reason, and likewise the Ovary and Uterus in the Hen, together with the
Veins and Arteries which are subservient to them, are so skilfully composed,
and the situation, figure, and temper of every particular, are disposed in a
miraculous method; and all these things are some way or other required to the
generation and fecundity of the egg: most certain it is (for nature makes
nothing in vain, nor does she go to work by digressions, where she may be more
compendious in her dispatch) that an egg cannot be any other way produced,
then now it is, (namely, by a cock and a hen) neither by nature of her own
accord, nor by any other means whatever; nor can either cock or hen be
produced, but from an Egg. So that the cock and the hen are made for the
Eggssake, and likewise the Egg for the Cock and Hens sake: and you may be
justly doubtful with Plutarch, which of these is first, namely the Egg, or
the Hen For she was first in order of Nature, but the Egg i^ order of Time.
For whatsoever excells, is first in order of Nature; but that from which
another i^ produced, is first in order of Time. Or else we may say, That that
Egg from which this or that particular Hen sprung, is of more Antiquity th^^
the Hen: and so on the contrary, That Hens which produces this particular
Egg, is elder then it. For this Vicissitude and Circuit perpetuate the Race
of Cocks and Hens; while now the Chicken, and now the Egg by a constant
series and return do continue an Immortal Species, out of the decay and ruins
of the Individuals. And after this sort do many sublunary creatures emulate and
approach to the Perpetuity of Celestial bodies.

And whether we affirm a soul to be in the egg or not, yet by this
circumvolution it appears, that there is some principle of the vicistitude from
the Hen to the Egg, and again from the Egg to the Hen, which conferrs a
sempiternity unto them. And that very thing (says Aristotle) bears an
Analogy to the substance of Stars; and causes the Parents to propagate, and
their seed, or eggs, to be de genesis an. l. 2. c. 3.
prolifical: and is like Proteus, disguised in several forms, ever existent
both in the Parents, and in the Eggs. For as that Mind or Spirit which rules
the world, does continually reduce the same Rising and Setting Sun from several
Quarters and Regions of the Earth: so also in the Progeny of Cocks and Henns,
the Vis Enthea, or divine Principle, which is now called the Plastical,
sometimes the Nutritive, and sometimes the Augmentatin Power or Virtue, is also
ever conceived to be the Conservative, and Vegetative too: and now putting on
the form of the egg, and now of the Chicken, continues for ever. And though
some Animals are born of their own Accord, or (as they commonly say) of
Putrefaction: and others only produced from a Female (as Pliny notes in some
kind of Lib. 9. c. 16.
living creatures there is no Male at all; as in the Ruffes, and the Roches:
for they are all taken great with spawn) yet whatsoever is produced from a
perfect egg, does not proceed but from both Sexes.

And therefore, says Aristotle, The Male and the de genesis an. l. 1. c. 2.
Female are chiefly to be counted the Principles of Generation. The Cock
therefore and the Hen are the two first Principles of the egg; the fruit, or
common conception of both which is the egg, containing in it the virtue of
both Parents. So that an egg can no more be made without the assistance of the
Cock and Hen, then the fruit can be made without the Trees aid. And each
particular Individuum, both Cock and Hen, seems to be created for the eggs
sake, that the same Species may be prolonged, though by the ruin and obsequies
of the Authors. And it is also clear, that the Parents are no longer youthful,
beautiful, complete and Jovial, then they can generate, or fructify their
eggs, and produce their own like, by the mediation of those eggs. Which work of
nature so soon as they have accomplished, as if then they had attained the
highest (...), or Pitch of their perfection, and last end for which they were
born, they presently wither, grow old, and Emerit, and as if God and Nature had
forsaken them, they decline speedily, and hasten to their end, like creatures
weary of their lives. Whereas on the contrary, the Males when they arm
themselves, and are in all respects well appointed for Loves encounter, how
strangly does the potent Cupid heighten their enflamed spirits, how spruce are
they, how do they pride it; how vigorous, how testy are they, and prone to
conflicts! But when this office and performance cease: oh! how soon does
their force abate, and their late fury cool! how do they hale in all their
swelling sails, and check their darings? Nay even while this jocund Sacrifice
to Venus is in season, no sooner is the act performed, but they grow tame and
pusillanimous; as if it were then deep printed in their thoughts, that while
they impart a life to others, they are in full career to their own urnes. Only
our Cock, full fraught with seed and spirits, approves himself the only
cheerful loser, and with the plaudit of his wings and voice, crowns his past
triumphs, and lights his wedding Torch at his own Cinders. And yet he also
flags after long game, and like an Emerit soldier resignes his Commission. And
so the Hens likewise, like Plants worn out, grow decayed Matrons, and fore-go
their Nurseries.

How a perfect and fruitful Egg is produced by Male and Female, according to
Aristotle.
EXERCIT. XXIX.
We have lately said, that an Egg, especially a fruitful one, is no
spontaneous issue; nor does proceed from any thing but a Hen, nor yet a
fruitful one from her neither, without her intercourse with a Cock: According
to that of Aristotle; We are to conclude, that male and female De genesis an. l.
1. c. 2.
are the chief principles of Generation: the Male, because he has the
preeminence in the original of the Motus and Generation, the Female in the
original of the Matter.

Now according to our decision, A fertile egg is truly a sperme, and genit all
seed, Analagous to the seed of Plants, and the first conception resulting from
both Parents, and the promiscuous production of them both. For as an Egg
cannot have a being without a Hen, so it cannot have fecundity without a Cock.

It remains therefore that we enquire, how the egg is made by the hen, and
how it is made fertile by the Cock; for we see that subventaneous eggs, and
those animate too, are produced by the hen: but yet are not prolifical without
the Cock. And therefore both Cock and Hen lay their stock together to
constitute a fertile egg. And yet (as I conceive) not in that manner as
Aristotle would have it; namely, that the Male should be Master only of the
original of the Matus and Generation: and the Female only contribute the
Matter. For the contrary appears in Subventaneous eggs: And tho^^ it be true,
where he says: The Male and Female are different according to reason, because
their faculties are diverse, and according to sense, because some^ of their
parts are diverse too. The difference between them according to reason consists
in this, that the Male is that creature which does generate in another; the
Female is that, which generates in it self, and out of which, that which is
generated is made, being contained in that which does generate it. But since
these (...) distinguished by the diversity of the Faculty, and of the Office or
employment; and every performance of (...) office requires an instrument; and
the parts of the body are commodious instruments to the faculties; it i^
necessary that some parts should be accommodated for procreation and Coition;
and that those parts should be different too, that so the Male and Female may
be distinguished.

Yet it does not thence follow, which he see^ desirous to infer, saying: The
Male is the Efficient and by the virtue of its Geniture does produce that which
is designed out of the Matter contained in (...) Female: and the Female does
always contribute the Matter. So that it is necessary that the Female should
contribute the Body, and the Quantity or Magnitude, but there is no such thing
required at the males hand. Nor is it necessary that the Instruments, or the
Efficient it self should be in those things that are produ^^^ by them. The Body
therefore proceeds from the female, and the soul from the male. For the
Substance of (...) Body is the soul. For an egg, and that an anima^^ one too,
is produced by the Hen alone, without the Cock. Whence it appears, that the
Female (...) Hen is also the Efficient cause; and that all power of Production,
or the Soul does not proceed (...) the Male. And this the example urged by
Aristotle seems to confirm: for he says. Those creatures De genesis an. l. 2. c.
4.
that proceed to Coition, and ^re not of the same kind (which they do, whose
season is alike, and time of hearing, together near at hand, and do not much
differ in the dimensions of their bodies) do bring forth their first issues
like to themselves, partaking of the Species of both kinds: as those that are
begotten by a Wolf and a Bitch, or by a Partridge and the Dunghil^rood: but in
process of time, these diverse Parents, produce a diverse issue, the offspring
at length assuming like form with the Hen, as foreign Seed is at last
transformed according to the Nature of the Soil where it grows, for the Soil
contributes matter and Body to the Seed.

By which words it is manifest, that in the Generation between a Cock-Partridge
and a Dunghil-Hen, the Male is not the sole efficient, but the Female is
concerned too: because a Common Species and form, and not that of the Male
only, is produced; being alike, both in Body, and Soul, as well to the Female
as the Male. Now the Soul ^^ the Form and Species of an Animal.

And again: the Female may seem to have most ^ight to the title of Efficient,
for he says, in Pro^^sse of time, these diverse Parents produce a diverse
(...), the offspring at length assuming like form with the Hen. As if the Seed
of the Male were less powerful; and did in time lose the Species which it
imprints; as being razed out and expunged by (...) more potent Efficient. And
this that instance concerning the soil does more strengthen: For, ^^reign Seed
is at last transformed according to the ^^ture of the soil where it grows. By
all which it (...) probable, that the Female is a stronger (...) in Generation,
then the Male: For in the Universe likewise, the Earth is held to be, as it
were, the Female and the Mother: But the Heavens and the De genesis an. l. 1. c. 2.
Sun, and the other Bodies of that kind, Philosopher^ call by the name of
Father and Genitor. Now the Earth also produces many things of its own accord,
without any Seed: And amongst Animals, some Females do procreate of themselves
without a Male; (thus the Hen generates a Subventaneous Egg) but the Male
never begets any thing without a Female.

Nay by those very Arguments which contend to prove the Male to be the
Principle of Generation, and the primary Efficient; the energy or efficiency of
the Female seems to be confirmed, and ratified: For that is to be counted the
Primary Efficient, in which the reason of the foetus, and form of the
Production is most eminent; and whose apparent similitude is discovered in the
foetus, and also which has an existence it self before, and then generates.
Since therefore, the Form, Reason, and Similitude of the foetus is no less
(not more) in the Female then in the Male; and she also is in being before, as
a Primary Mover: We may well conclude, that the Female is as eminent an
Efficient of Generation, as the Male.

And though Aristotle truly say, that the Conception or egg assumes no part of
its body from the Male, but only its form, species, and soul, and that the
Female contributes only the body, and quantity de genesis an. l. 2. c. 4.
Yet it does no way appear to the contrary, (...) that the Female does
contribute in some s^^ both Form, Species, and Soul, (and not the Ma^^ singly)
As is evident in the Hen, which produ^^ Eggs without a Male (as the Trees
bear the Fruits, Herbs and Seed without any distinction of Sexes at all.) And
Aristotle himself confess^ that even a Subventaneous Egg has a Soul. The
Female therefore must be the Efficient Cause of the Ibid.
Egg.

And yet though there be a Soul in the Subventaneous Egg, yet that Soul is not
Prolifical; and therefore we must acknowledge that the Hen is not properly
the Efficient of a Perfect Egg, but that she is so made, by Authority and
Commission procured from the Cock. For an Egg, except it be Prolifical, cannot
justly be said to be Perfect. Now such an Egg is produced only by the Male;
or rather by the Hen, having received such instructions from the Cock; as if
from his Coition, the Female did receive the Art, Reason, Form, laws, Rule
and Model of the future Foetus. Thus the Female (like a fruitful Tree) being
made fertile by Coition, is made Oviparous, bearing perfect and Prolifical
Eggs. For though the Hen have at present no rudiment of Eggs at all ready
in the Ovary, yet being fructified upon Coition, ^he suddenly after, both
has, and lays Eggs; and those also Prolifical ones. And here the experiment
of poor Women is of use; Which having a Hen at home, but never a Cock, they
commit her for a Fabric. page 37.
day or two to a neighbors Cock: and from that small communication, all her
eggs succeed fruitful, for all that seson.

That is, not only those Eggs, which now are Yolks, and only want a White,
or else have some Rudiment of their future growth, though never so little; but
even those Eggs also which are not yet begun at all, and are to be conceived a
great while hence, are all rendered fruitful by the same virtue.

The Benefit of this Disquisition con. cerning Fecundity.
EXERCIT. XXX.
THe Disquisition wherein we examine, What it is in the Egg that renders it
fruitful? is very subtle, and difficult, and of exceeding great use: As also
what is in the Conception, what in the Seed, and what in the Hen that confers
Fecundity upon them: Likewise what in the Cock distinguishes him from a barren
cock? Is it the same cause, which we call the Soul in the Foetus? or some part
of the Vegetative Soul? For the knowledge of the First Cause conduces much to
the complete science of Generation: For Science springs from Known Causes,
especially those that are the first Causes. Nor is this indagation less useful
to the knowledge of the Nature of the Soul. But when once the verity of this is
thoroughly discovered, not only Aristotle's opinion concerning the Causes of
Generation is refuted, and chastised; but even those things also which
Physicians have written against him, are easily disproved. Our Quere therefore
is, whether that which affords the Fertility to the Egg, Yolk, Papula, or
Whelke, Cock, Hen, and to its Womb, be one and the same thing, or diverse?
Likewise whether it be a Substance from whence this virtue flows? For it seems
to be susceptible of Powers, Faculties, and Accidents. Or whether it be also a
Corporeal thing For that seems to be mixed it self, which generates a mixed
thing; namely a similitude common to both Cock and Hen; such as is that
ambiguous Species produced by a Cock-Phesant and a Dung bil Hen. It seems also
to be a Corporeal thing, which suffers from without; in so much that it does
not only produce feeble issues, but deformed also, and sickly ones, and such
as are obnoxious to, and do inherit the Virtues, and Vices of their Parents.

We may also make a question concerning each particular, whether that which
confers the Fertility, be ingenerated, or comes from without? Namely, whether
it be transferred from the Egg to the Chicken; from the Hen to the Egg, and
from the Cock to the Hen. For it seems to be a thing ex Traduce; namely, which
is transferred from the Cock to the Hen; and from Her to the Egg, the Womb,
and the Ovary: From the Seed to the Plant, and back again from the Plant to the
Seed. For this is common to all things that are perpetuated by Generation;
namely, that their first rise should result from Seed. Now the Seed, the
Conception, and the Egg are all of one and the same kind, and that which
renders these Fruitful, is in all of them the same thing, or something of a
like nature; and that is some divine thing, and has an analogy to the Heavens,
to Art, Intellect, and Providence. As is plain by the wonderful operations,
artifice and counsel of those creatures, in whom nothing is constituted in
vain, rashly, or by chance, but all for some Good, and to some End. We shall
hereafter be more ample, concerning the Universal Speculation, and knowledge of
this thing: Having already spoken as far as occasion has presented it self to
discourse of it by the by, in order to the Hen-Egge. Namely, how many things is
that thing in, which brings Fecundity? and how is it in them? whether as an
Accident, as either an Affection, a Habit, a Power, or a Faculty? or as a
Form, and a Substance or as a thing Contained in a thing Containing or as a
thing reserved in some peculiar part? For it is most certain, that the very
Subventaneous egg is complete in all parts as far as sense can discover, and
yet it is Barren: and likewise, that the Uterus, and also the Hen are perfect,
and so is the Cock; and yet they all were barren, were they deprived of that
which conveys their Fecundity to them. All which we shall relate, after we have
expounded, What, and How, the two Principles, Male and Female, do confer to the
Egg, and to Generation; and likewise in what manner they may both be called
the Efficient Causes and Parents of the egg.

That the Egg does not proceed from the Cock and Hen, after that manner
which Aristotle would design.
EXERCIT. XXXI.
IT is most certain, that the Fertile Egg cannot be made, but by both Cock and
Hen: and yet not in that fashion as Aristotle thought, as if forsooth, the Cock
alone were the prime Efficient, and the Hen did contribute nothing but the
Stuff, or Materials.

For I am not of his mind, where he says: When the Seed of the Male enters
into the Womb of the de genesis an. l. 1. c. 4.
Female, it does reduce the purest part of the Excrement into a consistence:
and a little after. But when the excrement of the Female is in the Womb, it is
made by the Geniture of the Male, like to congulated Milk. For that Coagulum
is Milk containing vital Heat, which carries parts that are alike, the same
way together, uniting, and joining them. Now the Geniture ^^^eanes it self just
so toward the Menstrua, or excrement. For the nature of the Menstrua and of
Milk is the same. Therefore the parts being gathered together, the corpulent
humor is discarded, and upon the ^refaction of the more earthy part, the
Membranes result to encompass the whole; and this upon necessity, and to some
intent and use besides. And these things proceed in the same manner, as well in
all Oviparous, as Viviparous Animals.

But the matter is much otherwise, in the generation of the Egg. For the Seed
(or Geniture rather) proceeding from the Male in Coition, can by no means enter
the Womb. Nor has the Hen after Conception, any excrementitious substance, or
purer part of any such substance, or any Blood at all in the Cavity of the
Womb, which might receive perfection from the Geniture of the Male. Nor are the
Parts of the Egg (namely the membranes and the Liquors) procured by any kind
of Coagulation; nor is there found any thing like Coagulated Milk, as is clear
and evident out of what has passed. And hence it follows, that neither the
Conception (out of which the Animal springs, as out of Fertile Seed) is after
that manner as Aristotle imagined: For the Conception is after the same manner
in Viviparous, as the Egg is produced in Oviparous creatures: as himself
confesses, and shall anon appear in some of our Observations. For it is a
certain truth, that the Egg, be it barren, or fertile, is made and formed by
the Hen alone: only the fertility indeed is derived from the Cock. I
positively affirm, that the Cock conferres neither Matter nor Form to the
Egg; but only that thing by which the Egg is Fertile, and made fit and
capable to produce a Chicken. And this Faculty the Cock imparts by his
Geniture, discharged in Coition; not only to the Egg which is then begun, or
already made, but to the Womb also, and the Ovary, and likewise to the Hen her
self: and that after such a manner, that the eggs which are yet to come (of
which there is now no particle in being either in the Ovary, or any other part
of the Body) shall have the happiness to be fruitful by it.

Nor after that manner which Physicians fancy.
EXER. XXXII.
THe Conception according to the opinion of Physicians is thus: In Coition the
Male and Female being both delighted, do eject their Geniture, or Seed into the
Cavity of the Womb; and there their united stock or contribution is mingled
together; obtaining from both the potentiality of Matter, and the activity or
force of the Efficient cause. And that so it comes to pass, as the Geniture of
this or that Parent shall get the upper hand, the conception proves either Male
or Female. And they farther suppose, that immediately after Coition (the Active
and Passive ingredients now cooperating together) something of the Conception
is put in ^and, and begun.

They still affirming, contrary to those who side with Aristotle, that the Male
is no more the Efficient cause of Generation, then the Female, but something
compounded of them both: and likewise, that neither the Menstruous Blood, nor
the purest part of it; but the Sperm it self is the first Matter of the
Conception: and upon this ground, they call the first ground-works, or first
parts of the Conception, Spermatical Parts; which are afterward to be
nourished and supplied by Blood.

But the thing is plain, that this also is not the manner, by which the egg is
produced by the Cock and Hen. For the Hen does emit no Seed at all in
Coition, out of which the egg may be framed: nay more then this, there is no
part of her Seed to be any where found: for she is quite destitute of all parts
necessary to the Generation of Seed; namely, of Testicles, and Spermatical
Vessels. For though the Hen has an Efficient power together with the Cock, (as
appears by our former discourse) and that power which renders the egg fertile,
be in some sort a mixed power; yet this proceeds not from the overruling force
of the Genitures, or from the manner of their mixture: for it is very certain
(and Fabricius confesses it) that the Cocks Seed enters not into the Cavity of
the Womb: nor is there any particle of the egg made in the Womb presently upon
Coition; though Aristotle generally affirms there is, (saying, that some part
of the Conception does forthwith ensue) Nay I shall demonstrate hereafter, that
this commixture of Seeds does never obtain in any Animal whatsoever; and that
presently after Coition (though it succeed and be fruitful) there is no
particle of Seed, or Blood or of any begun or attempted Conception, really in
the Womb, or to be found there. Nor is there in truth any thing to be
discerned, in the Conception or Egg, that may any ways argue the Seed the Male
to be contained, or mingled in it. The Common people indeed do falsely conceive,
that the Chalazae are the Cocks Seed: and I much wonder, that since there are
two of them (in each extremity of the egg, one,) that no man has hither to
fondly pronounced, that the one was the Cock, and the other the Hens Seed. But
this popular error is soon blown over; for the Chalazae are a like manner
found, both in the Subventaneous, and Fertile egg.

That both the Male and Female, are the Efficients of Generation.
EXERCIT. XXXIII.
THe Physicians do rightly maintain against the Aristotelians, that both Sexes
participate ^^ the Efficient power; because that which is generated, is a thing
compounded of them both: for it is mixed of them both, in the figure and
similitude of the Body, and in the Species too; as suppose it a thing mixed
between a Partridge-Cock, and a Dunghil-Hen. And it is very consonant to
reason, for a man to conceive, that those are the Efficient causes of a
Conception, whose com-m^^ture that which is produced, does represent and
express.

And this is Aristotle's opinion. In some creatures, says he, it is apparent
that, that which generates is Metaphys. l. 7. c. 8.
such like, as that which is generated: and yet not the ^ame, not that very
numerical thing, but of the same Species, as in natural productions. For a Man
begets ^ man, unless something befall praeturnatural; as when ^^ Horse begets a
Mule, and the like. For that which is common to a Horse and an Ass, is not
called Propinquissimum genus, the Next Kind: and yet they two may be commixed
in one, for such is a Mule. And in the same place he says; The Generant is
sufficient to generate, and be the cause of the existence of the Species in the
matter: but such a Species being now in such particular flesh and Bones, is now
several persons, is Callias, and Socrates are.

Wherefore since such an entire form, as namely of a Mule, is mixed of both;
namely, Horse and Ass: the Horse alone is not sufficient to produce this form
of a Mule in the Matter; but as the whole entire form is mixed, so another
efficient cause must be conferred and joined to it from the Ass. That
therefore that does produce a Mule mixed of both, must be it self adequate, and
mixed too, if it be Univocal. As for example. This Man and that Woman, do beget
this Socrates; not under the capacity of being both of them Homines, Men, and
so are of one and the same species; but by reason, that this particular Man,
and that particular Woman, are of humane kind, composed of this and that
particular flesh, and bones: of both which since socrates is a kind of Mixture,
and is mingled of them both; that of which Socrates is made, must needs be as
it were a compounded Univocal mixed ^^ing; that is to say, the mixed Efficient of
a mixed Effect. And therefore the Male and Female, are not generative apart, but
as they are united in Coition, and made, as it were, one entire Animals and
thence from them both, as from one, the true efficient immediate cause of the
Conception does result, and is deduced.

The Physicians also, while they, minding only what befalls humane kind, give
resolutions at large concerning Generation in general; and it seeming probable
to them, that the Geniture flowing in Coition from both Parents, is the true
Sperme or Seed, proportionable to the Seed of Plants; do not without reason
constitute that mixture which is the next efficient cause of the future Foetus,
out of the mixture of the Seed of both Parents: and therefore affirm, that
such a mixed body is contained in the Womb presently upon Coition, and is the
first Conception. But our precedent History makes it appear, that the thing is
clean otherwise in an Egg (which is a true Conception.)

Concerning the Matter of the Egg, contrary to Physicians and Aristotelians.
EXERCIT. XXXIV.
THat which Physicians deny in opposition to the Aristotelians, namely that the
Blood is the First Matter of the Conception, does evidently appear out of the
Generation of the Egg. For there is no Blood at all contained in the Womb of
the Hen, either in Coition, or before, or after it: Nor are the Rudiments of
the Egg sanguine, but white. And many living Creatures conceive, in whose
Genitals (if you open them nimbly) not one drop of Blood is to be seen.

But while they contend, that the Mothers Blood is the Nutriment of the Foetus
in the Womb, especially of the Parts Sanguineae, the bloody parts (as they
call them) and that the Foetus at first, as if it were a part of the Mother, is
sustained by her blood, and quickened by her spirits: in so much that the Heart
beats not, and the Liver sanguifies not; nor any part of the foetus does
execute any public function; but all of them make Holy Day and lie idle; in
this Experience it self confutes them. For the Chicken in the egg enjoyes his
own Blood, which is bred of the liquors contained within the egg; and his
Heart has its motion from the very beginning: and he borrowth nothing, either
blood, or spirits, from the Hen, toward the Constitution either of the
Sanguineous parts, or Plumes; as those that strictly observe it may plainly
perceive. And I make no question, fully to demonstrate in my succeeding
Observations, that the foetus of Viviparous creatures, while they are yet
imprisoned in the Womb, are no way sustained by the Mothers blood, nor
vegetated by her spirits, but do rejoice in their own Souls and indowments,
(as the Chicken uses to do in the egg) and sat themselves from their own
stock of Blood.

But as for that which concerns the Matter of the foetus, arising from Male and
Female, and that so magnified manner of Generation, so much countenanced by the
confident Schools (namely, that the Conception is rendered prolifical from the
com^^sture of the Genitures, and their mutual Action and Passion) as also those
other Heresies of their concerning the Seed of Females, and concerning the
division of Parts into Spermatical, and Sanguineous; many, and those very
remarkable and excellent observations, which shall be treated ^^ hereafter,
have compelled me to dissent from them. I shall at present say only this, that
I extremely wonder, how Physicians (especially such as are skillful Anatomists)
should prop up their opinion upon two arguments, as most invincible ^ when
those very arguments, if rightly understood ^ do make against them rather.

As for Instance. From that Concussion, Solution and Profusion of Humor (which
befalls Women many times with delight, in Coition) they conclude^ that all
Women do emit a Semen in Coition, and that that Semen is necessary to
Generation. Whereas, to pass by this reply, namely, that the Female of all
Animals, nay all Women have not such a Profusion; and that it is no way
necessary that th^^ Conception must be frustrate without it: (for ^ know many
Women that are Mothers without it, and some also, which upon having it, were
indeed much affected with enjoyment, but came much short of their former
fruitfulness: Besides infinite and innumerable examples of Women, wh^^ though
they receive much satisfaction by their Husbands, do yet emit nothing, but do
conceive how ever) But I most admire that those, who com^ this Emission
necessary to Propagation, did not mind how that humor is ejected clean out,
and lost for the most part near the Clitoris, and out^^^ of the Secrets; but is
seldom admitted into them and never into the Uterus, that so it may be come
mixed with the Sperma of the Male; and that it also of an Ichorous, and Serous
consistence, (...) is, and not so Compact and Unctuous as ^^ Geniture, which
the very touch denotes.

Now wherefore should that be excluded out of (...), which is of so great
consequence within? (...) that humor, under pretense of departure, thrown out
to the utmost approaches of the U^^, that so it may be recalled again with the
^^ter bounty and favor?

Another Argument they erect upon the Spermatical Organs of Women; namely, the
Testiculi, and ^^ Spermatical preparing, and leading Vessels, which (...)
supposed to conduce to the Generation of the (...).

But for my part I wonder much, how they fan^^ that so elaborate, concocted,
and quickening ^^men, can arise from so imperfect and obscure (...), so that,
that of theirs (when the controversy concerning the preeminence and overruling
^^wer is in debate; namely, whether the Males or ^eirs commands in chief, and
which of the two ^^ to be reputed the Efficient, or Agent, or the Mat^^, or
Patient) should exceed the Males in power, (...), and generative ability; and
should subject the Males seed under it, enforcing it to submit it self to
supply the place of the Material Cause, notwithstanding it is digested by so
quick and active ^heat, refined in such variety of Vessels, and daring it self
with so much activity. But of these more hereafter.

In the mean time it is most certain, that the hen-egge is generated by no such
conjugal Profu^^^: though the Mother after recreation (as one ^ished with
delight) shakes her feathers for Joy, and as if she grew proud from the Boon
she received, composeth and rectifieth all her extravagant (...): like one that
adored the deity for the grand benediction of multiplying issues. Tha^ Pigeon
(especially that kind of Pigeon which (...) transported hither out of Africa)
expresses wonderful content from the enioyment of her Male, leaping, and
spreading her tail, and sweeping the low earth with the bristles of it, and
them combing and rectifying her Plumes with her Bill; as though she deemed
nothing comparable to the blessing of fertility.

We have said before, that the first matter of the Egg is not formed of Blood,
as Aristotle thought; nor yet as the Physicians conjecture, out of the
commixture of the Males and Females Geniture. But from whence we do derive it,
is partly already shown in our History, and shall be more largely explained
hereafter, when we treat in general of the matter which does constitute every
foetus.

How far the Hen is an Efficient Cause in the Generation of the Egg,
according to Aristotle: and why the assistance of the Male is required.
EXER. XXXV.
WE have already proved the Cock and Hen to be the two Principles of
Generation in regard of the Egg, though we are otherwise p^^^ swaded of the
manner how it comes to pass, (...) Aristotle and Physicians are. For we have
made it manifest out of the generation of the Egg, that the Hen as well as the
Cock is an efficient cause, and has in her a principle from whence the
mutation suceeds, and also a constituting faculty: though ^ Coition, neither
the Cock does confer matter to ^^e Egg, nor does any profusion of seed result
^^om the Hen, by which the Egg should arise. It ^^ therefore evident, that
nature (amongst some Animals at least) did not therefore institute a
distinction of Sexes; that the one (as an Agent) should contribute the form,
and the other (as the Patient) the matter, as Aristotle did conceive: nor that
a semen should result from both in coition, that about of the mixture of them,
a Conception, or Egg should be framed, as Physicians imagine.

Now since these two opinions do comprehend the whole Legend of Antiquity,
concerning the causes and principles of Generation: it appears that all men
were hitherto ignorant of the reason, does why the female does not generate
alone by her self (as Plants do) but requires the assocition of the male: and
also how the conception, or ^gge is procreated both by male and female thus
enjoined: and likewise in what either of them enduce to the work, and to what
end and purpose coition was instituted.

Aristotle, contrary to his own universal Hypostasis (namely, That the male is
the Agent, and the female only for the matters sake) perceiving the egg ^^
proceed from the Hen without any help of the ^ack at all, was enforced to
subscribe, that the female also is an efficient cause: and that the Egg, ^hen
it is excluded, does conserve, nourish, and ^^ment it self, and produce a
foetus out of it (...): (as the eggs, or spawn of fishes do) and therefore he
concludes, that there is also a soul even in a subventaneous, barren egg. And
how far forth the Female is an Efficient, and also a subventaneous egg
informed by a soul, he attempts to explain, where he says. Subventaneous eggs
admit Generation as far as they may; but that they de genesis an. l. 3. c. 7.
should be completed to the very fecundity of an Animal, is quite impossible;
for to that a sensitive soul is required. But even females, and all things
that live at all do obtain the vegetative faculty of the soul, as has bin
often repeated. And therefore this barren egg considered as the conception of a
Plant, is complete, but considered as an Animals, it is incomplete. By which
words he seems to consent, that the Vegetative soul is also in the very
subventaneous egg, because that soul is in all living things; now an egg
does live. He also allows the Hen a creating Prerogative, and a power of
inducing a Vegetative soul: because all females have that privilege: and
therefore a subventaneous egg considered under the capacity of a Plant, and
living as that does, is styled a perfect conception, but under the rank of
Animals, an imperfect one. A^ if the male were no whit requisite to the being
of the perfect conception or egg, but only that, out of that egg an Animal
might proceed: Not to the complement of the egg, in order to any perquisite
relating to its own perfection (for the conceptions of plants themselves are in
this sense complete) but that it may be endowed with a^ Animal principle. So
then, the Egg is made by the Hen, but is made prolifical by the Cock. Aristatle
in the same place goes on: In all the Genealogy ^^ Birds, there is a male and a
female; so that a Hen may make her conception perfect, as a Plant, though is be
unalterod by coition: but as an Animal, she cannot perfect it; nor can she
empower it to produce any other thing out of it. Nor is it rendered as the fruit
of a Plant simply, nor as of an Animal, by coition. He sreaks of a
subventaneous egg: and adds further: But those eggs which are conceived by
coition, and are (...) discovered to have obtained some portion of the White,
they become fruitful by virtue of that Cock who was first concerned in coition;
for they are now furnished with both Principles.

Whereby he seems to confess, that the Female also is an Efficient in
Generation, or has a generative power; because every female has a vegetative
^^ule: now generation is a faculty of the vegetative soul. And upon this
ground, when he propounds the difference between the male and female, he even
there owns them to be Generative (...): for he says, We call that animal the
male, which begets or generates in another, and that the female, which
generates in it self. And therefore according to Him, both do Generate; and as
have is in both a vegetative soul, so is there in both Generative power. But
how these differ, has been ^^ved before in the History of the Egg. Name^^ the
Hen, alone by her self, without any assistance of the Cock, Generates a
subventaneous egg, (as (...) do from themselves produce a fruit) but she (...)
not produce a fortile egg, with out either ^^ antecedent, or subsequent
Coition of the Cock. the female does generate, but it is only in some (...);
and the males coition is required, that that ^^rative faculty should be
perfected in the female: that so she may not only bring forth an (...), but
such an egg that may produce a chicken. (...) for this defect in the females
generation, the (...) seems to have been created (as shall herein appear) that
so what the female cannot complete alone, (namely the seed, or fertile egg)
that the male should supply by coition; wherein he does impart that power
either to the Hen, or the Egg.

A perfect Henne-egge has two Colors.
EXERCIT. XXXVI.
ALl eggs therefore are not perfect eggs; but some are reputed imperfect,
because they have not yet attained their just magnitude, which they afterward
do receive abroad: And others, bebecause they are yet improlifical, and
afterward do borrow a prolifical power from without; as Fishes eggs, or the
spawn of fishes. Other eggs also, are by Aristotle counted imperfect, because
they are of one color only; but those that are of two colors, perfect, as
being constituted of a Yolk and White: which are conceived to be more distinct,
better concocted, and endowed with more heat. And therefore those that are
called Ov^ Centenina, which Fabricius conceits to be only constituted of the
Relics and Remainders of page 10.
the White, are only of one color, and rep^^^^ imperfect, because of the
defect of their heat, and their own imbecility. But amongst all the egg^ that
are, there is none more perfect then the Hen, which is still produced perfect,
and adorned with all its liquors and accoutrements, and of a convenient and
just magnitude.

Now Aristotle gives this reason why it comes to De genesis an. l. 3. c. 1.
pass that some Eggs are of two colors, and others of one only: because, says
He, in hotter Animals those things out of which the rudiments of Generation,
and those out of which the Aliment is derived, are always distinct and apart:
and of them one is white, and the other yellow. As if the Chicken took its life
from the White, and were only fed by the Yolk. And in the same place he says.
That part of it which is hot, does more resemble the complexion of the parts
that are to be made; but that which is the more terrene part, affords only
supply to the body, and keeps at greater distance from it. And therefore in
eggs that have two colors, the Animal assumes its beginning from the White.
For the Animal rudiment is in the White, and the nourishment is derived from
the Yolk. Therefore we see his opinion is, that the foresaid Liquors are
distinct, and that eggs are produced party-colored.

And these Assertions of his, are partly true, and partly false. For it is
false, that the Chicken is made out of the White, and fed by the Yolk. For by
our History of the Fabric of the Chicken, both from the dissemination of the
Umbilical Vessels, and the distribution of their propagations, which without
all question do serve for the attraction of the Aliment, it is most manifest
that both the constituting matter and the Aliment, are from the first original
supplied both from the yolk and white; for some part of both these liquors does
melt and dissolve. And also the Macula, by whose first dilatation the
Colliquamentum is made, which is also styled by us the Oculus, or Eye of the
Egg, is plainly seen to be imprinted into the (...) of the Yolk.

And yet for all this, the distinction of the egg into the yolk and white does
seem to be very necessary: because those two Liquors, as they are without all
doubt of a diverse nature, so do they serve to a diverse use. And that is the
reason why they are distinct in every perfect egg; one of them being the
Aliment which is next at hand, and the other, that which is farther off: with
the one the foetus is sustained at its first formation, with the other in
succeeding time. For it is most unquestionable (as Fabricius affirms truly,
and we also shall explain anon) that both the Yolk and White are the Aliment of
the chicken, and th^^ the White is first spent. Wherefore I agree with
Aristotle against the Physicians, that the White is the most sincere, most
concocted, and elaborate part of the Egg: and therefore as being the better
part, it encompasseth the whole circumference of the egg, which is yet in the
Womb, whilst the Yolke as the more terrestrial part does reside in the
Center. For the White seems to contain (...) plenteous animal heat in it, and
therefore to be the nearer and first nourishment. And so also upon the same
account, the exterior part of the White, seems to be more simple, and better
concocted, then the interior.

In that Physicians affirm, that the Yolke is the hotter part of the egg, and
most nourishing, I conceive they understand it, in relation to us, as it is
become our nourishment, not as if it does supply more congruous aliment to the
chicken in the Egg. And this appears out of our History of the Fabric of the
Chicken: which does first (...) upon and devour the thinner part of the white,
before the grosser: as if it were more proper diet, and did more easily submit
to transmutation into the substance of the future foetus. And therefore the
yolk seems to be a remoter and more differred entertainment then the white; for
all the white is quite and clean spent, before any notable invasion is made
upon the yolk. Nay, the yolk is found in the Abdomen of the Chicken, even after
his exclusion, as if it were reserved for the Infant -chicken instead of Milk.

The two-coloured eggs therefore are most perfect, as being more distinct and
wrought up by a more vigorous heat. For since there ought to be treasured in
the egg not only the matter of the Chicken, but his first feeding too: that
which is provided for a perfect animal, ought it self to be perfect too; and
such is that egg which consists of two distinct complexioned parts: whereof
the one is the former, and more simple, and therefore of gentler digestion; the
other the latter, or more remote, and therefore translated into the substance
of the Chicken with more difficulty; (now the yolk and white are thus different
amongst themselves) and therefore Perfect eggs are Party-colored, compounded
of a white and yolk: as containing and storing up in them several provisions of
harder or more friendly digestion, according to the several age and ability of
the Chicken.

How the Egg is supplied with its White.
EXER. XXXVII.
IT appears by our History that the primordia of the eggs in the Ovary are
wondrous little, resembling small whelks, and less then the seed of Millet,
being full of a white watery moisture: and that these Papulae, or whelks do at
length shoot up into yolks, and that those yolks are at last invested and
clothed with a white.

Aristotle seems to be of opinion, that the white is generated out of the yolk
by way of Separation. Let us read his words: The Sex, says he, is not the de
genesis an. l. 3. c. 1.
cause of the party-colours, as if the white did proceed from the Male, and the
yolk from the Female; but both are derived from the female or Hen. But one is
hot, and the other cold. And in those creatures that have good store of heat,
they are distinguished from one another; but where that heat is fainter, they
are not distinguished. And for that reason the conceptions of such Animals are
of one only color, as is said. Now the Males seed only does constitute the
egg: and therefore at first the conception of all Birds is white, and small,
but in process of time, it is all yellow, because now a larger quantity of
blood is admixed; and lastly, the heat abating, the whiter part environs it
round, as being a humor equally tempered on all sides. For the white part of
the egg is naturally moist, containing in it an animal warmth, and therefore
it is placed about the egg, and the yellow earthy part remains within.

But Fabricius conceives, The White of the Egg to grow to the yolk by a juxt
aposition merely. For while, page 12.
says he, the yolk rowleth through the second Uterus, and falls down by
degrees, it does by degrees gather to ^ a part of the White, which is purposely
generated in the Uterus, that it may cleave to the yolk; until the ^^lke
having now passed the intervening or middle ^^ires, and arriving at the last of
all; it is together with the White encompassed with the membranes also, and
thou assumes a shell. He conceits therefore, that the egg attaines its
increase in a twofold manner; partly by the Veins, as it is with the yolke,
and partly by an additional accession or apposition, as it is with the White.
And this perhaps did induce him to be of that judgment; namely, because the
White being boiled hard, does easily part and distinguish into ^^kes, whereof
the one lies above the other. But his also does befall the yolk not yet
departed from the Ovary, if it be hard boiled as the former. And therefore
being otherwise instructed by Experience, I rather join in opinion with
Aristotle; for the White is not adjoined (as Fabricius would ^^ave it) but bred
also, and furnished with the Chalazae, and distinguished by several membranes,
and divided into two white liquors: and all this, by the same vegetative soul,
by whose industry the Egg it self is distinguished into two liquors, (a yolk
and a white.) For every part of the Egg is formed and constituted by the same
faculty which frames the whole Egg. Nor is it true, that the yolk is first
made, and then the white adjoined to it. For, what we see in the Ovary, is not
the yolke of an egg, but rather some compound, comprehending both liquors
mixed together. It resembles the yolk indeed in complexion, but the white in
considence: for being boiled hard, it is not friable (as the yolk is) but
concrete and glutinous, and consisting of several flakes, as the White, and
has as it were a white Papula, or whelk in the (...).

Aristotle seems to erect this separation from (...) Ibid.
diverse nature of the yolk and white. For, says (...) If you cast diverse
eggs into a basin, or such like (...) sell, and prepare them over a Chafin-dish
of coals in (...) sort, that the force of the fire be not nimbler the^ (...)
distinction of the eggs; the same thing will befall all the heap of eggs, as
happens to every particular eggs namely all the yolks will gather and assemble
themselves into the middle, and the Whites get round about th^^.

And this I have often experimented; and, what ever will, may try it: provided,
he shake the y^^ and whites together, and with a piece of butter ^^ gest them
temperately into a Cake, having mingled them between two dishes, placed over a
Chafin-dish of coals, or in an Oven; for he shall pl^^^ly see the whites cover
the yolks which are assembled at the bottom.

What the Cock and Hen do conferr^ to the Generation of the Egg.
EXER. XXXVIII.
BOth Cock and Hen are to be reputed the Chikens Parents; for both of them are
necessry principles of the Egg, and both alike Efficient causes. For the Egg
it self is the Henns work, a^ the Fertility the Cocks. Both are therefore
Instruments of the plastic virtue, by whose means the species is continued to
the world.

But since in some Animal species (as if the (...) were a useless thing, and
the Female alone did ^^ffice to the perpetuity of the species) there are no
Males to be found at all, but the whole race is female, as in some species
there are Males only, and no Females at all to be found; for they do all by an
emission of something out of them into the ^^d, the earth, or water,
progenerate, and preserve their species: Nature seems in these and the like
creatures to have satisfied her self with one sex only, using that alone (as
an instrument) for procreation.

And now again some other creatures have a seed provided for them, casually as
it were, without any distinction of sex at all; namely those creatures whose
Birth is spontaneous. For as some things Arist. phys. l. 1. c. 1.
are the productions of art, and the self same things are the issues of chance
too, as Health, for one: So likewise some kind of Animal seed is not simply
produced from an univocal Agent (as a Man from a Man) but only in some sort
univocal; (namely in all those creatures whose extract and matter out of which
they spring, is casual in relation to them, and yet undergoes a mutation of it
self, as the seed does) namely, Those Animals that are not produced by
coition, but are born of their own accord, are produced from such an original
as Insects have, which breed a worm. For as some Artificers de genesis an. l. 3.
c. 9.
work with their bare hands, but others again use instruments in all their
operations; and the better sort and more excellent Arts do employ instruments
of several figure and magnitude, to the execution of several, and especially of
the more curious and subtle Operations: (for the more eminent and more
laborious works, are made for the most part of several motions, and do require
several subordinate productions and ends; and in this thing, as in all other,
Art is Natures Ape, and Mimick) so in like manner Nature does of necessity set
a work more instruments, and those too of diverse faculties and abilities, in
the production of the more perfect, and more excellent Animals. For the Sun, or
the Heavens (or what ever else is understood to be a common and general Father
in the production of living creatures) do produce some things by themselves, by
chance, and as it were without employing any intermediate Instrument, by an
equivocal generation, and yet beget some only by an univocal procreation:
namely all those, that are begotten by some other of the same kind, which does
contribute both Matter and Form to them.

And thus in the Generation of the most perfect Animals, where these Principles
are distinguished, and these seeds of the Animals are distinct: the Male and
Female are the two necessary requisite Instruments to the production. And in
this manner is our Hen-egg produced from the Cock and Hen.

The Hen generates in her self, and therefore communicates place, materials,
nourishment, and cherishing to the conception; but the Cock conveighs
fecundity: For the Male, says Aristotle, does ever Genesis an. l. 2. c. 3.
complete the generation, and causes a sensitive soul to be introduced, and
from an egg creates an Animal.

And therefore proper Organs for both faculties are dispersed among the Cocks
and Hens. Namely in the Hen, all the Genital parts are commodious for
reception, and containing; and in the Cock for transferring and immission, or
preparing of that thing which does conveigh fecundity to the Hen, he being
one that generates in another.

Now, having made strict discovery, by Anatomical dissection, of the parts
sacred to Generation, we well know, what both Male and Female do confer to
it. For the knowledge of the Instruments does lead in a straight line, to their
functions and uses.

Some things worthy observation concerning the Cock.
EXERCIT. XXXIX.
THe cock (as we have showed you) is the Primary Efficient of the perfect or
fertile egg, and the main cause of Generation. For were it not for the cock, a
chicken could never spring from the Egg; nor the Egg it self have any being
in many Oviparous creatures. And therefore we must make farther search
concerning the Action and use of the cock, namely what advantage he brings to
the egg, and the chicken, as well by Coition, as other offices.

It is evident that the cock (though, as I suppose, he wants a Yard) does emit
his Geniture, commonly called Seed, as may be collected from his Genital Parts;
for the Testicles are furnished with it, and there is great abundance of it
discoverable in the long and ample Leading Vessels. But whether it leap out,
capering, and frothy by the activity of the spirits, and at several ejections
(as in hotter Viviparous creatures) I am not yet able to resolve. But because I
can find no Vesicles containing the Geniture, by which it should be fermented,
and dart forth, heightened by the spirits into a Spuma, or froth: and also
finding no Yard through whose narrower channel it being protruded, it might
leap, and result, verberating the Interiours of the Hen, especially seeing
coition in Cocks so soon over; I rather believe, that there is only a light
tincture of seminal humor, such as does only moisten the Orifice of the
Pudenda; and that the seed is speedily dislodged without any sprightly
exilition: so that, what other Animals do ejaculate by several reverberations
at one and the same Inition, Birds (which do not long insist upon venereal
undertakings) do expedite by many repeated Coitions. For those creatures that
dwell long in venereal offices, do make but feldom repetitions: and such, among
Birds, are the Swan, and the Ostrich: Because the Cock therefore cannot stay
long in his performances, he does execute that at several returns, which other
creatures do at several impulses. And though he neither have Glans, nor Ponis,
yet the extremity of the deferent Vessels growing turgent by spirits (in
Coition) does extuberate after the manner of a Glans, by which he does compress
the Orifice of the Uterus of the Hen, it being bared and exposed by the
apertion of the Fundament; and so bedewing it with genital moisture, he stands
in no need of a Yard for the immission of his Geniture.

Now, we have showed you, that the Cocks Seed is of so great virtue, that it
does render not the Uterus only, but the Egg in the Uterus, the Papula in the
Ovary, and lastly the whole Hen her self, and all the Rudiments of the Eggs,
either already in being, or to be produced hereafter, fertile and Prolifical.

And therefore Fabricius rightly observed, that store of Geniture was entrusted
to the Testicles, and deferent Vessels of the Cock: not that the Hen stands
want of much of it to fructify each single egg; at that one Cock may approve
himself sufficient ^^ his several Concubines, and repeated performances.

Now the brevity and rectitude of the Cocks spermatical Vessels do conduce to
the nimbler discharge of the Seed: for that which travels through long and
perplexed Meanders, makes slower passage, and needs a more copious impulsive
spirit to quick^^ its Exit.

Amongst the Males, none more jovial, none more haughty, nor of stiffer garb,
nor more effectual in concocting his food, then the Cock, a great part of whose
Aliment is transformed into ^eniture; and therefore Polygamy is convenient for
him, as ten or twelve obedient Hens. For in some species of Animals, one single
Male can treat ^boudance of Females, as we may see Stags, Bucks, and several
Cattle: and there are others again there the lusty Female is not satisfied by
several Males; as the Bitch, and the Wolf; upon which ^ore Meretrices Lupae
dicuntur, Prostitutes are called Wolves, and Brothel-houses Lupanaria. And
^gain some Creatures are more chaste, and reserve, ^s it were, a Conjugal
integrity: so that one Male keeps faith with one Female, and both pro^^d
virtuously to propagate their kind. For ^^ce Nature requires, that the Male
should supply the defects of the Female in Generation, and that ^^ alone is not
sufficient to sustain, cherish, and defend her issue, the Male is added as a
Consort ^o her, who should join in the task of generating, and nurturing the
Young. Thus the Partridges enjoy a Conjugal Life, and because their (...)
cannot hatch so many eggs at once, nor attend the education when the Young are
excluded they are reported to build each of them a N^^. And so the cock-Pigeon
takes his turns of Incubation, and joins in the erection and fabric of hi^
nest, and likewise in laying in provision for he offspring. And so in like
manner you may discover many examples of a Conjugal life among bruit beasts, of
which more hereafter.

But those Males that serve many Females (a^ the cock) their Testicles are much
lined with Seminal moisture, and they are provided with long and large deferent
Vessels. And at that time, and age that the cluster in the Ovary begins to
ripen and become mature, and stands now in need of Fructifying, that the
Papulae may be perfected into Eggs, the cocks seed begins to increase, and hi^
Testicles grow turgent and tumorous, and are also seated in the same place
(namely near the Diaphragma) into which they instill fertility. And this is
evident in fishes, birds, and all other Oviparous creatures, whose males are
all replenished with seed, at the same time, and place, whereat their females
do conceive their eggs.

And therefore all those parts of the Hen which are designed to Generation,
namely, the Ovary, Infundibulum, the process of the Womb, and the Womb it self,
and the Privities: and also the situation, fabric, quantity, and Temper of
all these, and what soever else relates thereto: they are all inservient, and
handmaids either to the procreation of the Egg, or to its Augmentation, or
else to Coition, and fertility received from the Male, or to the foetus: to
which they conduce either necessarily and principally, or as a Causa sine qua
non, or some way or other to the better being.

For there is nothing made either vain or rash in all the operations of Nature.
So likewise all the Genital parts in the Cock are contrived for preparing or
concealing, or else transmitting the geniture into the Hen.

But such males as are so vigorous, that they can supply many females, these do
much exceed heir females in their growth, and stature, as also in their
^^naments, courage, and weapons; which is not so eminent in those that are
conjugal and chaster. For a cock-Partridge, Crow, or Pigeon, are not so much
superior and different from their consorts, as the Cock is from the Hen, or
the Stag from his Hindes.

And therefore the Cock, as he is well appointed in his weapons, brave in his
plumes, haughty, ambitious, valiant, and a famous Duellist; so does he also
abound in Seed, and is swift in his chamber-offices, and of so unbounded a
luxury, that (except he have his Seraglio for his concubines) ^e will tire out
his wives by frequent invitations, and compressions, and (as we have observed
in the Pheasant, the Turkey-cock, and others) will cruelly handle them, with
unseasonable advancings, and molestations. I have seen Hens sometimes so tired
and torn by the insolency and incivility of the insatiate Cock, that all their
backs have been deplumed, and they themselves by deep ex^^^erations piercing to
the bare bone, have miserably expired.

Of the Hen.
EXER. XL.
THere are two first Causes and Instruments of Generation, the Male and Female.
For the Hen seems to be the Author of the Egg, as the Cock of the Fertility:
and therefore by the coition of these two, that which renders the egg
fruitful, is traduced from the Male into the Female, or generated in the Female
by that coition.

But what that is, is no less difficult to be known then to what it is
communicated: namely, whether to the whole Hen, or to its Uterus, or to the
Eggs already made, or else to all the Eggs not begun in the Ovary, or to be
begun hereafter? For it is probable, according to our former discourse^ and
also by Fabricius his experiment, that a (...) coitions, and the commerce of
the Hen with the Cock for a few days, does sufficiently fructify her, or
her womb at lest, for a whole year together. And I my self, informed by
experience, can parth affirm the same thing; namely, that the twentieth egg
laid by the Hen (after her divorce from the Cock) has been fruitful, and
prolifical. That a^ from the geniture of the Male-fishes scattered in ^^ water,
a great family of eggs is endowed with the lifical virtue; and as in Bitches,
and Sowes, and also other Animals, some few coitions have satisfy to the
fertility of several foetuses: (insomuch the some think it an approved Maxim,
that in case Bitch be oftener compressed by the dog then th^^ or four times, it
will wrong her fertility, and make her births degenerate most into females) ^^
also the Cock by some few familiarities with the Hen, does not only render the
egg now being in ^he Ovary, but the entire Ovary, and Hen her self prolifical
(as has been often repeated.) Nay, what ^s more then this, and admirable
indeed; In a cer^^in part of Persia (says Aristotle) if you cut up a Hist. an.
l. 6. c. 37
(...)-Mouse, you shall find even the young ones within ^^, that are females,
to be great with young themselves: being made mothers before they are born: as
if ^he male did not only fructify his female, but all ^he females also of
which she labors; as our Cock ^oth not only render his hen fruitful, but all
^he eggs also that she is to lay.

Now this Physicians do confidently deny, who ^^me the conceptions of Animals
to be produced by the mixed geniture of both Sexes. And there^^e Fabricius,
though he pronounce the Cocks seed ^ver to enter, nor to have any possibility
of en^^ance page 38. 39.
into the hollow of the womb, (where either ^^ egg is made, or increased) and
though he ^^inly saw, the eggs now newly begun in the Ovary, to be made
fertile by the same coition, as ^ell as those eggs which were already made; ^^
particle of which could be made by the seed of ^t Cock; yet he will needs have
the Cocks seed ^s if its presence and continuance were absolute^^ necessary) to
be locked up for a whole year together in the pouch of a prolifical Hen, and
there to ^^ reserved in a blind chink. Which perswasi^^ we have formerly
rejected, and that because ^t cavity is indifferently found as well in a Cock,
in a Hen; and also for that we could never scover such a standing pool of
Geniture, either that cavity, or any other cranny in a Hen: but soon as the
Geniture has delivered her message, ^^d performed her trust, by imprinting a
prolifical virtue in the Hen, it either retires back again, or is dissolved,
and rarefied into air, and so vanishes. And though Galen, and all Physicians
with Arist. de genesis an. l. 2. c. 3.
him, do strongly oppose this dissolution of the Genture, yet having thoroughly
considered the fabric of the genital part by Anatom call administrations, and
having likewise pondered other most invincible arguments, they must necessarily
acknowledge, that the seed of the male, as it is derived from the Testicles by
the leading vessels, and contained in the spermatical vessels, is not
prolifical, unless by the fervency of Coition, and desire, it become aerial,
and rarefied into a spume. For (witness Aristotle) it is not the corpulency of
the seed, or Ibid.
its fire, that renders it prolifical, or any quality like to those, but the
spirit which is enclosed in the seed and spumous body, and the nature which is
in that spirit, being answerable and like in proportion to the Element or
substance of the Stars. Wherefore, though we should indulge Fabricius in his
opinion, that the Seed is reserved in that pouch; yet notwithstanding, after
the prolifical effervency, or the spirit is resolved, it would grow useless,
and improlifical. And from hence may Physicians take notice, that the geniture
of the male is not therefore the architect of the foetus, because the first
cenception assumes its body from it, but because it is spirituous, and boiling,
as being inspired with a fertile spirit, and turgent like a thing possessed.
For otherwise Averrhoes his fable, of the woman that conceived in a Bath, might
have some title to true story. But of these things more in their proper place.

As therefore the Egg is made by the Hen, so i^ it also very likely that all
the first conceptions (a^ shall be shown hereafter) do assume both their
Matter and Form from the female; and that also after the males geniture is
immitted, and now for some time quite departed and vanished away. For the Cock
does not confer any fertility to the Hen or Eggs, by the bare emission of his
geniture; but only so far forth as that geniture is prolifical, and
empowered with a plastical virtue; that is to say, spiritous, operative, and
proportionable to the subtence of the Stars. The male therefore is no more to
be prized as the chief principle of the conception, and foetus, by reason he
can concoct and emit seed, then a female, which can produce an egg without his
help. But he therefore rather claims prerogative, in that he impowers his seed
with spirit, and divine efficacy; and so, that in a moment it can perform its
affairs, and conveigh fertility. For as we see things immediately set on fire,
and infamed by a spark struck from a flint, or by a flash of Lightning from a
cloud; so the geniture of the male does immediately affect the female with the
touch, and transferres fruitfulness unto her, which does not only virtuate the
eggs, but the womb also, and the Hen herself, and all in an instant: for to
combustible substance is sooner set on fire by the approach of the flames, then
the Hen is made pregnant by the coition of the Cock.

But what it is that is transferred from him to her, we shall have occasion to
discover in its order, then we shall determine the matter more perspicuously
and in general.

In the mean time we must take notice, that if it be derived from the soul (for
it is most likely that whatsoever is fruitful, the same is also animate, and
we have said before, that an Egg in Aristoiles opinion is endowed with a
vegetative soul, as also all the seed of Plants) that soul (at least the
vegetative) must of necessity be ex traduce, and derived

(...) in a Prolificall Conception as after it) as it is in the Generation of
the Chicken out of the Egg, and just in that manner as Plants do spring from
seeds of their own kind. For it does not appear that the Male is required, to
the intent that he should be as an Agent, Operatour, or Efficient per se, nor
that the Female, is required that she should contribute the matter; but both
Male and Female are to be esteemed in some sort the Operatour, and Parent: and
the foetus is procreated a mixed similitude, and resemblance, as if it proceeded
from both mixed together. Nor is it true which Aristotle often affirms, and
Physicians take for granted, namely, that presently after Coition, there is
something to be found of the foetus, or conception, (as the Heart, or the Tres
Bullae, or some other Principle part) or something at least in the cavity of
the Womb, as some Coagulum, or Spermatical mixed substance, or the like. But on
the contrary, in case the Female prove fertile, and pregnant, it happens that
the eggs, and conception in the most, and most perfect creatures, is first
begun long after coition. And that the Female also is prolifical, before any
thing of the conception be at all contained in the Womb, many indications do
conspire to ascertain, as shall be afterward discovered in the History of
Viviparous Animals: as the enlargement of the Breasts, and the turgid swelling
of the Womb, by which and other Symptoms we may perceive an Alteration in the
whole Body.

But as for the Hen, though she have for the most part the Rudiments of eggs in
her before coition, which are afterward by the Tread made prolificall, and
therefore she then has something in her presenly upon coition, or treading:
yet when it falls out so with her, that like other creatures, she has nothing
at hand ready in her Ovary, or has already laid all the eggs she formerly had
there; she being afterward trod (though some time pass between and intervene)
as if she were then both Principles her self alone, or did possess the power of
both Sexes, does after the manner of Plants generate eggs by her self, and
those too (I speak it knowingly) not subventaneous, but prolifical.

For if you take all the eggs from under a Hen that is now sitting, in case
that very Hen was a fruitful Hen in former time (though she have now already
laid all the eggs she has, and have not so much as one remaining in her Ovary)
she will lay again, and those eggs shall be fructifying, prolifical eggs, having
the principles of both Sexes in them.

In what respect the Hen may be called the Primum Efficiens, the first or
Chief Efficient. And also of her issue.
EXERCIT. XLI.
WE have already pronounced the Hen, to be an Efficient Cause of Generation, or
natures Instrument in that employment; (but she is not absolutely, and per se;
but by commission, and by virtue of the Male rendered prolifical.) But as the
Male is by Aristotle counted the first principle of Generation, suo merito,
upon his own score, because the first Motus or progress toward Generation
proceeds from him; so the Hen also may in some respect be esteemed the first
cause of Generation; insomuch as the male by the approach and presence of the
female, like one possessed, is inflamed to Venery. The female-Fish (says
Pliny) at the time of Lib. 9. c. 50.
coition will pursue and follow the Male, punching his belly with her head: And
again, about the time of bringing forth, the Male will do the like to the
Female. I my self have sometimes seen the male Fishes follow the female that
was ready to spawn, (just as Dogs do a salt-Bitch) all in troops, that they
might sprinckle her eggs so soon as she had laid them, lacte suo, with their
milkey substance, or seed. But that is most sensible in wanton and lascivious
females, which will stir up Cupids slow and drowsy fires in their tame
males, and instill a silent love into them.

And hence it is, that the Dunghill-cock, so soon as ever he sees his own
spouse whom he has missed never so little a while, or any other stranger-Henn,
being presently arrested at Cupids suite, he mounts her. And likewise when he
is Victor in fight, though he return wounded and wearied from the battle, yet
he still delights to ravish his captives wives. And that he may kindle this
declining spark of lust, which now lies expiring in his breast, into a vigorous
flame, with several gesticulations, incitements, and Love-scenes (while he
often crows, assembles his Henns, and now approaching circuits about them, and
trailes his stiff wings at their feet) he enticeth his Females, as by a spell
or enchantment, to sport with him. Now these are the Cocks projects and arts:
but sometimes the coyness and morosity of the Hen does not a little conduce to
rouse and heighten the males sleepy heat, and languishing appetite, to quicken
and encourage his performance. But of these provocations and allurements, so
far as they serve to promote conception, we shall speak more anon. For if you
carefully ponder Natures works, you shall find none of them made in vain, but
all directed to some end, and for some good.

Almost all females are pleased and delighted with the act of coition, and
rejoice at their great bellies, but many groan at their delivery. But the thing
is quite contrary in Hens, which in coition complain, and hang back; but in
laying, though the Egg be very great in comparison of their own bulk and the
streights of the Uterine Orifice, and the Egg brings no furtherance at all to
his own release, (as the Issues of Viviparous animals do) yet she brings forth
without any pain, and still rejoices as soon as she has laid, and raising a
loud laughter, invites in the Cock to share in her triumphs.

But though there are many rudiments of eggs, of different magnitude, and
degree, in the Hens Ovary, insomuch that some are augmented and come to
maturity before others, yet they all seem to be fructified alike, and receive
the prolifical stamp together, by the Cocks coition.

And though a good space of time pass away (namely, thirty days or more)
before the Common -hen or Partridge-hen disburden all the Eggs in their Ovary,
yet when ever the Hen sits upon them, they bring forth all their chickens
almost together, at the set time (namely, in the compass of twenty, or two and
twenty days) and they are all likewise no less complete, then if they had all
taken the same rise and original at the same instant of coition (as the Bitches
whelps do.)

And being upon this contemplation, while I consider how small the prolifical
ground-works of Eggs are, namely little whelks, and exudations, less then the
seeds of Millet; and meditating the stature, magnanimity, and furniture of the
Cock who is born from thence; I cannot but admire, that Nature should entrust
such great abilities to so slender beginnings: and observe, how the Omnipotent
Creator is pleased to manifest his greatness most, in the smallest originals.

For the Hen, and the Cock, that haughty and magnificent Animal, springs from a
small and almost invisible whelk. A vast Tree rises from a little Acron. Nay,
from the smallest bud and point of an Acorn, how does the Aged Oak display her
spreading arms? how lofty a crest does she exalt to heaven? and how deep a
root does she send down to fathom the earth? It is indeed (says Pliny) an
incomprehensible miracle, that a substance Lib. 17. c. 10.
which defies the axe, that presses, undaunted at the hugest weights, that
masts patient of the largest sails, and ramms unbattered by the shock of
Towers, and Bullwarks, should proceed from so mean principles. But this is
Natures power, this her ability. Now there is such a little sprout in the seeds
of all Plants, whose bare top of all no bigger then a point, if it be once
pared away, all hope of generation presently dies, as if the entire plastical
virtue that is to fashion and compose the whole Tree, did take up its abode in
so small a point. And therefore the provident Ant, eating of this small
particle before hand, does safely treasure up the grains and seeds of corn in
her barns that lie under ground, cunningly, providing by this means against
the inconvenience which she might suffer in their growing afresh. The
Cypress-Tree (says the same Pliny) bears a seed exceedingly affected by the
Ant; and this enlarges the miracle, that so inconsiderable an Animal should
devour and destroy so vast a Tree in its cra^le. But of these also in general
we shall speak more, when we shall show that many Animals themselves,
especially Insects, do germinate and spring from seeds and principles not to be
discerned even by the eye, by reason of their contract invisible dimensions,
(like those atoms, that fly in the air) which are scattered and dispersed up
and down by the winds: all which are esteemed to be Spontaneous issues, or born
of Putrefaction, because their seed is not any where seen. And this speculation
is useful to that Philosophy, which teaches, that all things are made out of
nothing; for between the Original, and the Complement of any Living creature,
there is almost no commensurable proportion.

Nor are we so much to admire, what it is in a Cock, that does conserve and
govern so perfect and noble a creature, and is the first cause of his
existence, which we say is his soul: but far more what it is in the egg, nay
in the very whelk, which has so grand an authority to produce so gallant an
animal, and advance its own renown to so high a stretch of glory. Nor are we
only to admire, how great the Artist is that does assist and cooperate in so
great a work; but rather the manner of conveighance, it being by the contagion
of only a momentany coition: namely, what the thing is that passes from the
Male to the Female, from the Female to the Egg, and from the Egg to the
Foetus? What it is, that is hoc Traducis, this Derived essence, which cannot be
perceived to be either remaining, or touching, nor any sensible contained
thing; and yet does operate with a vast discretion and providence, beyond all
the bounds of Art: and which does render the Egg prolifical, even when it self
is fled and vanished, not because it now does, or has touched before; not
fructifying only the perfect, and absolved eggs, but even the imperfect and
intended only, when they are yet but whelks and pushes: nay the Hen her self
before she have yet produced any whelks at all, and that so nimbly, as if the
Almighty himself should say, Let there be a production, and strait there is one.

Let Physicians therefore cease to wonder at what they do not find, but with
astonishment; namely, at Contagious, Epidemical, and Pestilential Diseases, how
they do foment and disperse their infection through the air, and propagate
distempers like to themselves in other bodies, and by a secret course, as it
were, by a solemn generation tacitly multiply, and grow sometimes so
destructive, that (if God would leave the reins in their own hands) they would
spread a sweeping desolation over Men, and Beasts: for greater things then
these are the daily results of the generation of Animals. For more, and abler
operations are required to the Fabric and erection of Living creatures, then
to their dissolution, and plucking of them down: For those things that easily
and nimbly perish, are slow and difficult in their rise and complement. Seneca
(as he is wont) elegantly Not. quest. l. 3. c. 27.
says: How long a time is required to ripen the conception for the Birth! With
how great care and tenderness is it trained when now it is an Infant! With what
choice of aliment is it cherished to a Youth! and yet how obnoxious is this
carcass at last! how lost without any pains! An age builds Towers, which one
hour levels with the ground. With great caution things continue, but perish at
an easy rate. The Forest which is growing long, one active spark and moment
turns to cinders. Nay, not so much as a spark; for the conflagration of the
vastest bodies, will put us only to the expense of a Burning-glass, where the
Sun beams being assembled, and directed in a Cone, will raise a nimble flame
to speed the mischief. So that nothing is difficult to Natures Royalty, which
to the production of things is sparing of her power, and warily dispenses it
with a great deal of thrift, by insensible accessions; but she is quick to
destroy, running in full speed. In the generation of things, the best, eternal,
and omnipotent God, or Natures deity, is evidently seen; but all mortal things
find out a thousand ways to ruin, of their own accord.

How the generation of the Chicken is procured out of the Egg.
EXER. XLII.
WE have thus far considered the Egg, as the Fruit, and End: it remains,
that we now treat of it, as the Seed, and Principle. Now page 28.
we must enquire (says Fabricius) how the generation of the Chicken follows
out of the Egg; taking our rise from that Principle or Position of Aristotle
and Galen, and approved by all: namely, That all things that are made in this
world, are produced of these three; the Agents, the Instruments, and the
Matter. But because in natural Productions, the Agent is not without, but
either existent in the Matter, or Instruments, he concludes, That we are to
consider of the Agent, and Matter only.

But because we are here to show after what manner the Chicken is made out of
the Egg, I conceive it not useless, to demonstrate, how many several ways one
thing may be said to be made out of another: for by that means it will more
clearly and distinctly appear, how many several ways generation does proceed
from an Egg, and what is to be resolved, concerning the Matter, Instruments,
and Efficient.

Aristotle has taught, that one thing is made out of another four manner of
ways: First, when we say the De genesis an. l. 1. c. 18.
Night is made out of the Day, and a Man of a Boy; because this is after that.
The second, when a Statue is made out of Brass, or a Bed-stead out of Wood, or
whatsoever we affirm to be made of matter, that so a whole may result, from
something that is formed, and in it. Thirdly, when of a Musical, a man
unskilled in Music, or of a Sound, a Sick man, or one contrary of another.
Fourthly, as Epicharmus makes his exaggeration: of Calumnies, Cursings; of
Cursings, Conflict. All which are referred to the first beginning of the
progress; for the Calumnies are a certain part of the whole Broile. Since
therefore one thing may be made out of another so many ways, it is apparent,
that the Seed is in another, two of these ways. For that which is begotten, is
out of it, either as out of its matter, or as its first mover. For it is not
barely, as this thing is after that, as Navigation after the Panathenaea, nor
as one contrary out of another; for a contrary is begotten out of the
corruption of a contrary, and there must needs be some subject matter, out of
which, as out of a first immanent thing it should be made. By which words
Aristotle truly inferres, that the Seed proceeding from the male, is the
efficient cause of the Foetus, or else the Instrumental; because it is no part
of the Foetus, neither according to the First, nor third acceptance (namely,
as this thing out of that, or as out of its contrary) nor is it the subject
matter.

But, as he says in the same place, that which proceeds from the Male in
coition, is not truly and properly called Seed, but Geniture rather, and does
differ from Seed properly so called. For that is called Geniture, which
proceeding from the Generant, is that first cause which obtains the beginning
of the generation; namely, in those creatures which Nature has designed to
generation: but the Semen is that thing which takes its original from the
coition of those two (namely, the Male and Female:) and such is the seed of all
Plants, and of some Animals, in whom there is no distinction of Sex: as being
that which is first mixed by the Male and Female, as it were a promiscuous
conception; and such as we have formerly in our History declared the Egg to
be, which is called both a Fruit and a Seed. For the Seed and the Fruit are
distinct things, and differ ratione prioris and posterioris, under the notion
of that which is first, and that which is after; for the Fruit is that which
proceeds from another, the Seed is that out of which another does proceed;
otherwise they were both the same. It remains therefore that we enquire, how
many of the foresaid ways the Foetus does proceed, not from the Geniture of
the Male, but from the true Seed, or Egg, or Conception (which are truly the
seeds of Animals.)

How many ways the Chicken may be said to be made out of the Egg.
EXERCIT. XLIII.
IT is therefore granted, that the Chicken is made out of a prolifical Egg, as
out of its Matter, and as by its Efficient; and that the same Egg is both the
Causes of the Chicken. For as it deduceth its original from the Hen, and is
esteemed the fruit, it is the Matter: but in as much as it contains in it,
throughout all its substance, a plastical, and prolifical virtue infused by the
Male, it is called the Efficient of the Chicken. So that not only (as
Fabricius would have it) these things are inseparably joined together in one
and the same Egg; namely, the Agent, and the Instrument, but it is also
necessary, that the same place should also contain Aliment, by which it should
be nourished. So that in a prolifical Egg these four things are to be found
together; namely, the Efficient, the Instrument, the Matter, and the Aliment,
as appears plainly in our History.

Wherefore we affirm, that the Chicken is made out of the prolifical Egg all
the foresaid ways; namely, as out of its Matter, Efficient, and Instrument:
and also as a Man is made out of a Boy, and the Whole out of a Part: and also
tanquam ex Alimento, as a thing may be said to be made of its nutriment; and
likewise as a contrary is made out of a contrary.

For when by Incubation (by the Internal motive principle) some clear part is
liquefied (which we call Ovi Oculum the Eggs-Eye) we say that very thing is
made tanquam ex contrario, as a contrary out of a contrary: as we suppose the
Chyle to be made out of contraries by concoction; (namely, out of crude,
unconcocted meats) and in the same sense, as we our selves are said to be
nourished by contraries. Just in that manner is the Colliquamentum and the
Oculus Ovi made of the White, and augmented: and in that manner likewise is the
Blood and the Vesicula pulsans (which are the first particles of the Chicken)
made, nourished and augmented, out of that white liquor, or Colliquamentum:
nourished I say, the Nutriment being assimulated by concoction (as out of its
contrary) by the power of the innate heat; for that which is crude and
unconcocted, is contrary to that which is concocted and assimulated: as a Man
unskilled in Music is contrary to a Musician; and a Sick man, to a Sound.

And when Blood is made out of the white Colliquamentum, or the Colliquamentum
out of the Yolk or White, it is called the generation of the one, and the
corruption of the other: there being an alteration made from the contrary to
the contrary, the same subject matter remaining still. For the proceeding form
of the White being corrupted, the Colliquamentum arises: and from the
privation of the form of the Colliquamentum, resulteth the form of Blood: in
the same manner as nourishment is turned into the substance of that which is
nourished.

Therefore in this sort the Chicken is said to be made out of the egg, tanquam
ex Contrario, as out of a Contrary. For the Chicken being nourished and
increased in the Egg, both the Yolk and the White are corrupted and consumed,
and afterward all the substance of the Egg. It is therefore manifest that the
Chicken is made out of the Egg, as out of a contrary, namely, as out of
Aliment: and also, tanquam exprivatione, and non ente, as out of a Privation
and non Ens. For the first particle of the Chicken, (namely the Blood, or
Punctum saliens) is made ex non sanguine, of that which is not blood, and
altogether its contrary, the same subject Matter still remaining.

The Chicken also is made out of the Egg, sicut vir ex puero, as a Man is made
out of a Boy. For as out of Plants Seeds are made, out of Seeds, Blossoms,
Sprouts, Stems, Flowers, and Fruits: so also out of an Egg, (which is the Hens
Seed) is made the dilatation of the Macula, the Colliquamentum, the Blood and
Heart, as the first particle of the fatus (or fruit.) And that, tanquam ex
nocte dies, as the Night is made out of the Day; the Summer out of the Spring;
and a Man out of a Boy: Where this thing, is after that. So that as the Fruit
does arise in the same Stem after the Flowers; so likewise, after the Egg the
colliquamentum; and after that, as out of the Humor Primigenius, out of the
radical first moisture, the Blood, after the Blood, and out of it, the chicken;
as the Whole out of a Part. And again, as by Epicharmus his Exaggeration, ex
calumnia fiunt maledicta, and ex maledict is pugna, out of slander come
cursings, and out of cursings fighting. For the Blood together with the Punctum
saliens is first existent; and does likewise seem to be a part of the chicken,
and a kind of Efficient, or Instrument of its Generation, inseparable from the
Agent: (as Fabricius supposes) Now, in what manner the Egg may be called the
Instrument and Efficient of Generation, is in part showed already; and shall
appear more at large hereafter.

It is evident out of our History, that the Punctum saliens and the Blood,
(while they increase) do assemble the rest of the body and all the other
members of the chicken to themselves: as the Yolk in the Womb, descending from
the Ovary, encompasseth it self with the White, and that by way of concoction,
and Nutrition. Now all men conceive calor. innatus, aut calidum innatvm, the
innate or primigenial Heat, or Spirit diffused through the whole, and the Soul
in that Spirit, or the faculty of that Soul, to be the common Instrument of the
Vegetable Operations. The egg therefore without all question has its Operative
soul, which is all in the whole, and all in every part; and contains a spirit,
or Animal heat in it, which is the immediate instrument of that soul.

If any man therefore ask, how a chicken is made out at the egg? We reply,
after all those ways recited by Aristotle, or invented by any else, after the
which, one thing may be made out of another.

Fabricius is mistaken concerning the Matter of the Generation of the Chicken
out of the Egg.
EXER. XLIV.
AS I decreed with my self from the beginning, so I shall continue to take
Fabricius along with page 28.
me in my progress: and therefore we shall consider with him of those three
things, which he says are to be inquired after in the Generation of the
chicken, namely, the Agent, the Matter, and the Aliment of the chicken. All
which ought to be in an egg, concerning which he proposes some doubts,
together with the opinions of Authors, who are of another mind. The first doubt
relates to the Matter and Aliment of the chicken. Indeed Hippocrates,
Anaxagoras, Alcmaeon, Menander, and De Not. pueri.
all the ancient Philosophers, did conceive the Chicken to be born out of the
Yolk, and nourished by the White. And Aristotle and Pliny, contrary Hist. an.
l. 6 c. 3. and De genesis an. l. 3. c. 1. and 3. l. 10. c. 53.
to that opinion, did believe, that the chicken did assume its body from the
White, and its Aliment from the Yolk. But Fabricius for his own part, conceived
neither Yolk nor White to be the Matter of the chicken: endeavoring to confute
the former opinions, and to show, that both Yolk and White did serve to nourish
the Chicken. And this, besides other Arguments (which I conceive to be of less
force) with this which is evincing enough, namely that the propagations of the
Umbilical Vessels (by which without doubt the chicken does attract his Aliment)
are disseminated both into the Yolk and white, and that both those liquors
(accordingly as the chicken increases, and does expend a greater stock of
nourishment) are quite exhausted. And hereupon Fabricius for confirmation page
34.
of his opinion, says: There are three only substances which do conduce to
the fabric of the egg, and the generation of the chicken, the White, the Yolk,
and the Chalazae: the White and Yolk are the Chickens substance; therefore the
Chalazae only are the subject matter of the chicken. But that the most
excellent Fabricius is in an error, we have demonstrated before in our History.
For after the chicken is well nigh completed, when his Head and Eyes are
distinctly to be seen, the Chalazae are still found in the Egg far remote from
the Chicken, and still entire, being then depressed from the two ends of the
egg to the sides, and do execute (as he also confesses) the office of
Ligaments, to keep the Yolk in its true position within the White. Nor is that
true neither, which Fabricius adds to justify his persuasion; namely, that
the Chalazae are seated directly under the Obtuse Angle of the Egg. For after
the first days Incubation the Liquors shift their stations; the Yolk is
exalted, and the chalazae are depressed from both ends, as has been said.

He is also deceived, when he says that the chalazae are parts of the Egg:
for in truth, the egg is constituted only by the Yolk, and the White; but the
chalazae, as also the membranes, are only certain little Appendixes of the
White, and nothing else but merely the extremities of the membranes contorted
and twisted, (as filaments or strings are twisted into a Rope) that so they may
the better preserve the Liquors in their proper places, by a firmer tie.

And therefore his Inference is infirm, when he says: The chalazae are found
to be in that part of the egg where the chicken is made, and therefore the
chicken is made out of them. For even according to Fabricius himself, that can
no ways be: who confesses, that the chalazae are to be found in the two
extremities of the egg, and yet denies, that the chicken is any where made, but
only in the Obtuse end of it: in which end truly, from the very first setting
out toward the Generation of the Chicken, there is no chalazae to be found at
all. Nay, if you make trial in a New-layd Egg, you shall find that the
superior chalaza is not directly seated under the Obtuse end, or the cavity
thereof, but inclining something to the side; nor on that side neither, where
the cavity does tend, but rather on the contrary side. Moreover, it has been
showed before, that the situation of the Liquors immediately upon Incubation
is shifted, because the Oculus, or Eye of the egg being enlarged by the
colliquamentum, is exalted to the cavity in the Obtuse Angle, upon which the
liquors and chalazae at each end do remove to the sides. For the Macula or
Speck, which before Incubation, was seated in the midst between both the
extremities of the egg, now being enlarged into an Oculus, or Eye, is adjoined
to the cavity in the Obtuse end; and one of the chalazae is deposed from the
Obtuse Angle, and the other is exalted (so much as the other is deposed) from
the Acute Angle; (just as the Poles of the World are seated in an Oblique
Hemisphere) and at the same time, the greatest part of the White, especially of
the grosser part of it, does sinck down to the Acute Angle.

Nor is that true neither where he endeavors to infer a probable argument to
prove the chalazae to be the Matter of the Pullus, from the likeness and
similitude of their consistence, alleging, that the chalazae page 35.
do represent the first formation of the Chicken, by their figure and
longitude, and have also as many twists or knots, as there are principle parts
in the Chicken.

Nor is that corpus Rubrum (which he also took for the Liver) or red substance
in the chalazae, or any thing near them, but in the middle of the
colliquamentum candidum; and it is the rudiment of the Heart only. Nor does
the example of the Tadpoles alleged by him, square to his purpose, of which,
says he, you can only discern their Head and Tail, that is, their Head and
spine of the Back, having neither forelegs nor hinder-legs. And he proceeds,
that whosoever sees a Chalaza, and one of these conceptions, will think he
sees one and the same body.

Now I have made many dissections of these Tadpoles, and have seen a pretty
large Belly in them, and in that Belly Guts, and a Liver, and a Heart panting;
and also I have discovered their Head and Eyes too. But that which Fabricius
takes for their Head, is their round figure, from which they are called Gyrini;
because their form or figure in gyrum vertitur, curles into a round. They have
also a Tail by which they swim, but legs indeed they want. Yet about the
Solstice, they lose or cast their Tail, having then hinder-legs, and forelegs
beginning to strut out. Now there is nothing in the first division of a Chicken
into his Head and Spine, that any way resembles this; which should any way
induce us to believe that the Chicken is made out of the Chalazae, in manner of
a Tadpole.

To proceed farther in the confutation of this matter, the worth of Fabricius
(a man so exceedingly well skilled in Anatomy) forbids: nor indeed is there any
great need, since the thing is so evident in our History. He at last concludes,
that this his opinion is wondrous old, and was on foot in Aristotle's days. But
I rather think the opinion of Ulysses Aldrovandus to be old, by which it is
thought, that the Chalazae are the Cocks Treddle, out of which, and by which
the chicken is procreated.

But neither of these opinions is true: for that the Grandines, or Chalazae
(the Italians call them Galladura, and our Countrymen the Treddle) do either
proceed from the Cock, or are his seed, is a vulgar error, and an old Wifes
tale, both heretofore, and in our times.

The Grandines (says Aldrovandus) are the Cocks sperme, because no fertile
Egg is without them. No nor infertile Egg neither; which he or knew not, or
did not declare. And this Fabricius indeed acknowledges; but while he denies
the Cocks seed to enter into the womb, or to be any where found in the Egg;
yet he still contends, that the Chalazae, before any other parts of the Egg,
are chiefly stocked with fecundity from the power of the Males seed, and do
contain a prolifical virtue; though he could not observe that there is no
difference or distinction at all between the Chalazae of the barren and the
fruitful egg. But seeing he has granted, that the very rudiments of Eggs in
the Vitellary are as well fructified by the Cocks treading, as those Eggs which
are encompassed with the white. I suppose the occasion of his so able a man's
error was this: It was hitherto (as we have often said) the received opinion of
all Philosophers and Physicians, that the Geniture of the Male, or Female, or
of both together, was the subject matter in the generation of Animals: out of
which residing in the Uterus (after coition) the Animals are generated (in like
manner as Plants are made, and spring out of the seeds sown in the ground:)
nor was Aristotle much distant from this opinion, who would needs have the
menstruous blood to be the woman's, which the Males geniture does coagulate, and
so constitute the conception.

Now the foresaid Error being granted by all, (for an infallible principle) it
is no great wonder, if afterward (according to every man's particular
conjecture) many false opinions do creep in. For they are quite beside their
mark, who conceive that after coition some kind of substance or matter does
remain, fit and convenient for the production of the foetus, or first
conception; or that any thing else is formed in the cavity of the womb, which
may be of like use with the seed which is sown in the bowels of the earth. For
it is most certain, that in the Uterus of a Hen (and the same thing shall be
afterward evidenced of all females whatsoever) upon coition, nothing is to be
discovered, more then was there before.

And therefore it is clear that Fabricius is out, when he says, As a
Viviparous animal is incorporated of a little quantity of seminal matter, but
that which page 35.
sustaineth him afterward is in a great abundance: so also the little Chalazae
are sufficient for the generation of the Chicken; but all the other parts
contained in the Egg, serve only for his nourishment.

By which words he declares, that he conceived such a kind of substance was at
hand in the Egg, for constituting the model of the foetus: lest he should
seem to recede any thing from the definition of an Egg, delivered by
Aristotle; namely, An Egg is that thing, out of part of which an Animal is
produced, and the remainder of which becomes the Hist. an. l. 3. c. 8. de genesis
an. l. 2. c. 1.
nourishment for it when it is produced.

And this therefore seemed an invincible Argument to Fabricius; Since there are
three only parts in the Egg; namely, the White, the Yolk, and the Chalazae:
and the two first do only administer nutriment to the Chicken; it must needs be
that the Chalazae only are the matter, out of which the Chicken is constituted.

Thus then it fell out, that this able Anatomist (while he sought in the Egg
some convenient matter, out of which to constitute the Chicken) being benighted
by a vulgar Heresy, lost his way. And this inconvenience does likewise befall
many men more, who forsaking that light, which the frequent dissection of
bodies, and the familiar converse with Natures self would help them to, do
yet persist to make discoveries out of their own conjectures, or some
conceived probable arguments, or the Authority of former Writers; when they
themselves ought to look into the matter, and assent to it by their own sense.
No wonder therefore that infinite errors, which were delivered over by common
consent from the first dawning of Antiquity, are handed down even to our times:
and that so by that means, men otherwise very ingenious, are egregiously
deluded; because they conceive it plentiful satisfaction of mind to them,
that they find it in Books, and have their memories well loaded with sage
sentences. For they that are thus Philosophers extraduce, by descent and
derivation, are just as wise as their own Libraries.

To conclude therefore, there is in an Egg (as we have often said) no distinct
part, or disposed matter, out of which the foetus may be formed and fashioned:
but as in the seeds of Plants, there is a little point or budding shot out; so
is there in an Egg, a small Cicatrice, or Macula, which being inspired with
plastical endowments, enlarges it self into the Oculus or Colliquamentum, out
of which, and in which, the primordia of the Chicken (namely the Blood and
Punctum saliens) are ingendered, nourished, and augmented, till they become a
complete Chicken. Nor is Aristotle's definition of an Egg true, where he will
have it to be that, out of part of which the Chicken is made, and nourished by
the rest; unless you understand it thus: An Egg is that, out of part of which a
Chicken is framed, not as out of its Matter, but as Vir ex Puero, a Man is made
out of a Boy: or thus; An Egg is a perfect conception, out of which the
Chicken is said partly to be made, and partly to be nourished: or lastly thus;
An Egg is that thing, whose liquors do serve both for the Matter, de genesis an.
l. 2. c. 4.
and Nourishment of the parts. And in this sense Aristotle teaches, That the
matter of the foetus in women is menstruous Blood, which (while it is poured
into the womb by the veins) Nature emploies it to another use; namely, to the
use of Generation, that such another creature may be made, as it would have
been; for it is already such in potentia, in possibility, as the bodies from
whence it was separated; that is, the Mothers.

What the Matter of the Chicken is, and how the Chicken is formed in the Egg.
EXERCIT. XLV.
SInce therefore the truth cannot, as I suppose, be attained out of the
opinions of other men, (whether they be confirmed by either their naked
authority, or probable argumentations) unless wary experience be employed in
the discovery: we shall declare to you out of Natures own Volum, and clear
Observations, what the Matter of the Foetus is, and how it is formed thence.

I have declared that one thing is made out of another (as out of its Matter)
two several ways, and that as well in artificial, as natural Productions, but
especially in the Generation of Animals. The First is, when one thing is made
of another thing that is pre-existent; and thus a Bedstead is made out of
Timber, and a Statue out of a Rock, where the whole Matter of the future
fabric was existent and in being, before it was reduced into the subsequent
shape, or any tittle of the design begun. But the other way is, when the matter
is both made, and receives its form at the same time. As therefore Artificial
productions are perfected two several ways; one, when the Artificer cuts and
divides the matter which is provided to his hands, and so by paring away the
superfluous parts, does leave an Image remaining behind, as the Statuary does:
the other, when the Potter forms the like Image of Clay, by adding more stuff,
or augmenting, and so fashioning it, so that at one and the same time, he
provides, prepares, fits, and applies his materials: (and in this way an Image
or Figure may be rather said to be made, then fashioned) so likewise in the
Generation of Animals; some are formed and transfigured, out of matter already
concocted and grown; and all the parts are made and distinguished together per
metamorphosin, by a metamorphosis, so that a complete Animal is the result of
that Generation: but some again, having one part made before another, are
afterward nourished, augmented, and formed out of the same matter; that is,
they have parts, whereof some are before, and some after other, and at the same
time, are both formed, and grow. Now the Fabric or constitution of these,
proceeds from some one part, as from its original, and by the help of that, the
other members are produced, and these we say are made per Epigenesin, by a
post-generation, or after-production; that is to say, by degrees, part after
part; and this is more properly called a Generation, then the former.

After the former way does the generation of Insects proceed, as when by a
Metamorphosis a Worm is made of an Egg; or as when out of a putrefying matter
(the moisture drying, or the dry part growing moist) the primordia or rudiments
are generated, out of which (as out of a Cankerworm now grown to its just
magnitude, or out of the worm called Aurelia) by a Metamorphosis arises a
Butter-flie, or common Fly in its just magnitude or stature, being nothing
augmented since its first birth. But the more perfect Animals which have blood,
are made by an Epigenesis, or superaddition of parts, and do grow, and attain
their just stature or (...), after they are born. In those other, Casus seu
Fortuna, Chance or Fortune, seems chiefly to promote the generation; in which
the form arises ex potentia materiae prae-existentis, out of the power or
potentiality of the pre-existent matter; and the matter is rather the first
cause of the Generation, then any external Efficient. And hence it is, that
these kind of Animals are more imperfect, and do less continue their kind, or
are less durable, then Terrestrial or Aquatile creatures that have Blood, which
attain a Perpetuity from an Univocal principle: (that is, from the same
Species) the chief cause whereof we ascribe to Nature, and the Vegetative
Virtue.

Some Animals therefore sua sponte nascuntur, are born of their own accord, out
of a Matter digested of it self, or else casually, as Aristotle seems to
assert: Whose Matter is capable of mutation of it self, undergoing that
mutation by Chance, which seed Metaphys. l. 7. c. 9.
does, in the generation of other Animals. And the same thing falls out in the
generation of Animals, as in Art: for some things are accomplished by Art, and
those very things, by chance too; as Health: and other things again are never
produced without Art, as a House.

Bees, Waspes, Butterflies, and all those creatures, that are generated out of
a Worm by a Metamorphosis, are said to be Casu orta, creatures bred by chance,
and therefore things not preserving their kind: but a Lion, or a Cock, are
never made by chance, or of their own accord, but have their existence from
Nature, or a more divine operative faculty; at whose hands they rather require,
that it produce a Species like to themselves, then supply a fit Matter.

In Generation by Metamorphosis, creatures seem to be fashioned like things
wrought off with a Mould, or the Print of a Seal; where the whole Matter is
transformed. But an Animal produced by Epigenesis, attracts, prepares,
concocts, and applies the Matter at the same time, and is at the same time
formed, and Augmented. In those the Plastical virtue divides the same fimilar
Matter, and being divided, disposes, and reduces it into members; out of a
similar Matter making a dissimilar; or out of a similar subject Matter,
dissimilar Organs. But in these, while it produces diverse parts, and those
parts diversely disposed, one after another; it requires and makes a diverse
Matter, and that Matter diversely disposed, or qualified, such as may be
convenient to the production of different parts. For which cause we conceive,
that the Perfect Egg is constituted and made up of several parts.

It therefore is clear by our History, that the generation of the Chicken out
of the Egg, proceeds rather per Epigenesin, quam per Metamorphosin, by an
Epigenesis, then by a Metamorphosis; and that all its parts are not constituted
at once, but successively, and in Order; and that while it is augmented it is
also formed, and while it is formed, it is also augmented; as likewise that
some parts are superadded to others, and distinguished from others; and that
the beginning, increase, and perfection of it do proceed by way of growth, till
at the last the Foetus does result. For the forming Faculty of the Chicken,
does rather acquire, and temper its own Matter, then find its Matter ready
tempered, and fitted to its hand; and the Chicken seems more to be framed, and
increased by his own self, then by any other. And as all things are increased
or nourished by the same things, out of which they are made; so likewise the
Chicken is in all likelihood made by the same thing, (be it the Soul, or some
faculty of the Soul) by which he is preserved, and sustained. For the same
Efficient and Preserver, is found both in the egg and in the Chicken; and out
of the same Matter of which it does constitute the first particle or rudiments
of the Chicken, it nourishes, augmenteth, and superaddeth all the other parts.
Lastly, in Generation by Metamorphosis, the whole is distributed and
distinguished into parts; but by Epigenesis the whole is constituted, and made
of parts, by a certain order and succession.

Wherefore Fabricius did erroniously seek after the Matter of the Chicken, (as
if it were some distinct part of the egg,) which went to the imbodying of the
Chicken) as though the Generation of the Chicken were effected by a
Metamorphosis, or transfiguration of some collected lump or mass, and that all
parts of the body, at least the Principal parts were wrought off at a heat, or
(as himself speaks) did arise and were corporated out of the same Matter: and
not by Epigenesis, in which an order is observed according to the dignity, and
worth, and use of the Parts; where first a small foundation is laid, which at
the same time while it does increase, grows distinct, and formed, and so
attains all its parts by degrees, according to their proper order, which are
supergenerated, and born to it.

For as the little top or point which jets forth or protuberateth from the
Acorne, taking heat and increasing, multiplies into a Root, Wood, Sap, Bark,
Shoots, Tendrels, Boughs, Blossoms, and Fruits, and at last arises into a
complete Tree: such is the progress of the Chicken in the Egg; the Cicatricula
or small speck, which is in the foundation of the future Pile, increases in
Oculum, into an Eye, and at the same instant is distinguished into a
Colliquamentum, or dissolved substance, in whose Center is born the Punctum
sanguineum pulsans, the Bloody panting point, together with the Ramifications
of the Veins: from these does by and by result the Nebula, or little cloudy
Substance, and first concrete Matter of the future Body, which also as it
grows, is divided, and distinguished into parts, but not all at once, but such
as give place and eldership to one another.

To conclude therefore, in the Generation of those Animals, which are produced
by Epigenesis, (as the Chicken in the Egg is) we are not to enquire a
particular or distinct matter, out of which the productions should be imbodyed,
different from that out of which they are nourished and increased: for it is
nourished and increased by the same matter, whereof it is made, and so on the
oath hand, the Pullus in the Egg is constituted out of the same matter, by
which it is sustained and augmented. And potentia animal, an Animal in
potentia, is one and the same thing, with Alibile and Augmentativum, a creature
fed, and augmented in potentia, (as we shall show hereafter) and do differ
only ipso esse formally, (as Aristotle says) but otherwise are the very same.
For, for as much as this particular thing is, and is convertible into
substance, Nutritivum est, it is Nutritive: and for as much as it is quantum,
endued with quantity, it is Augmentativum, Augmentative: for as much as it is
substituted in the room of a substance that is lost, Nutrimentum appellatur, it
is called Nutriment: for as much as it is added to a substance already in
being, Incrementum dicitur, it is called Growth. And the same thing is Materia,
the Matter in the Generation; Alimentum, the Sustenance in the Nutrition, and
Incrementum, the Increase in the Augmentation of the Chicken. But that is
formally and simply said to be generated, whereof no part was existent before,
but that to be nourished and grow which was, and had an existence or being
before. That part of the Foetus which is first made, is said to be begotten or
born: that which is substituted or superadded to it, is said to be annate,
aggenerate, or born to it. There is in all things the same generation, and
transmutation from the same into the same: which is performed in respect of a
part, by Nutrition and Augmentation, but in respect of the Whole by Generation:
else it is the very same in both. For from whence the first existent matter
proceeds, from thence also does Nutriment and Growth accrue unto it.

And it shall also appear by that which shall be delivered hereafter, that all
Parts of Bodies are nourished by the same Nutritive substance diversely
transformed or altered. For as all Plants do indifferently spring, grow, and
are sustained from the same Common Nutriment, diversely varied and digested
(whether it be Dew, or the juice and moisture of the ground) so likewise out of
the same Liquors of the Egg (namely, the White and Yolk) the whole Chicken,
and all its parts are procreated and increased.

We will then also explain, what Animals are begotten by a Metamorphosis: and
what kind of pre-existent matter that of the Insects is, which spring from a
Worm, out of which, all the parts are together constituted and concorporated,
and at last a perfect Animal born, by Transmutation only: as also what Animals
have any order and degrees in their production, and have their Parts produced
successively: and what kind of creatures they are which are first borne
imperfect, but afterward shoot up, and attain to perfection, as all those that
are produced out of an Egg.

These, as they are together made, and augmented, growing, and transformed; and
are by a proposed method and order distinguished into parts; so have they no
immediate pre-existent Matter (such as is usually designed them; namely, the
commixture of the feminine and masculine seed, or the Menstruous Blood, or some
little portion of the egg) out of which the foetus should assume his body; but
so soon as ever the Matter is made and provided, it grows also, and takes some
shape; so soon as there is a Nutriment, there is a creature to be nourished by
it.

And this Generation is rather by Epigenesis (as a Man is out of a Boy) that
is, the fabric and structure of the body is out of the Punctum saliens, as out
of its foundation: as out of the Keel the Ship is built: and rather as the
Potter forms an Image, without any pre-existent Matter; then out of any subject
matter: as the Carpenter forms a Bench out of Boards: and the Statuary a Statue
of Marble. For out of the same matter whence the first particle of the Chicken,
or its least atome arises, thence also does the whole Chicken proceed: whence
the first small drop of Blood, thence also is the whole stream or current of it
generated in the egg: whatsoever gives a consistence or being to the members or
organical parts of the body, does also afford the same to all the similar parts
likewise; as, to the Skin, the Flesh, Veins, Membranes, Nerves, Cartilages, and
Bones. For that very part which was soft and fleshy, at first, is afterward
upon its increase, made a Nerve, Ligament, Tendon, by the same Aliment; that
which was only a Membrane, becomes a Coat; and that which was a Gristle, is
afterward advanced into a Skin or Bone; and this by the same similar matter
variously altered. For a similar mixed body (which is commonly conceived to be
framed out of the Elements) is not made of the Elements first subsisting apart
by themselves, and then afterward compounded, united, and altered, but out of
this particular mixed body being altered, another mixed body is born and
produced, that is, Of the Colliquamentum is the blood made, of the blood the
bulk of the body; which bulk at first does appear similar, and like the
Spermatical Gluten, or clammy substance; but from it the parts are delineated
by an obscure indiscernable division at first, but afterward become organical
and distinct.

Those similar parts, I say, do not arise from the dissimilar, and
heterogeneous Elements, united together, but are framed and discriminated by
Generations out of a similar substance, and so become dissimilar. As if by the
Omnipotents command, or fiat, the whole Chicken were created.

As thus: let there be a similar White lump, and let that lump or mass be
divided into parts, and increased; and while it is increased, let there be a
secretion and delineation of the parts; and let this part be harder, thicker,
and whiter; and that softer, and well colored; And it was so. For thus does
the structure of the Chicken in the Egg proceed daily; out of one and the same
matter are all its limbs and utensils made, nourished, and augmented. From the
Spine first do the Ribs grow out, and the Bones are distinguished from the
Flesh, by their most white slender Lines: three Bullae are discernable in the
Head, which are all fraught with a Crystalline Water, being the Rudiments of
the brain, After-braine, and (as by a sprinkled black streak is employed) of
one of the Eyes: The substance which at first resembles coagulated milk,
becomes at last gristly, spinous, and bony: and that which at first was white,
and gelly-ish: passes at length into a blushing flesh, and Parenchyma. That
which was formerly most transparent and pure Water, is transformed anon into
the brain, Afterbraine, and eyes. For there is a far greater, and diviner
mystery in Generation, then a bare assembling, altering, and compounding of
Parts: for the Whole is made and discovered before its parts; the Mixed body
before the Elements. But of this more hereafter; when also its Causes, and
Principles come to be assigned.

Of the Efficient Cause of the Generation of the Chicken, and Foetus.
EXER. XLVI.
THus far of the Matter, out of which the Chicken springs in the Egg: it
remains now that we enquire a little with Fabricius, concerning the Efficient
cause of the Chicken. But because it is a perplexed business, and Authors do no
where more cavil and contend; and Aristotle himself is wonderful intricate in
explaining it; and also many doubts, not to be despised, do interpose; I
conceive it worth the while, (as we have done in making search after the
Matter) in the first place to set down, how many ways a thing may be said to be
Efficient, or Effective: that so it may more certainly and distinctly appear,
what is to be enquired after under the name of Efficient; as also what is to be
resolved concerning the opinion of Authors about this matter: and that it may
likewise appear out of our own observations, what is to be truly and properly
called an Efficient.

Aristotle defines an Efficient cause, to be that from whence the first
beginning of Mutation or Rest proceeds; Metaph. l. 3. c. 2. and Phys. l. 2. c.
28.
as an Adviser; a Father; and simply, he that does a thing, of the thing that
is done; that which is the transmutor, of that which is transmuted. Whereupon
many and sundry kinds of causes, from whence a motion or mutation does proceed,
are brought and amassed in the Generation of Animals: sometimes an accident, or
quality is assigned the Efficient, and so the animal heat, and forming faculty
are alleged, as the Efficient. Sometimes an external substance before
existent, in which the plastical power, and forming faculty resides; as the
father, or the seed of that creature by whose efficacy the Chicken is
procreated of the egg. Sometimes some internal substance existent by it self;
as the spirit, or Calidum innatum. And sometimes some other substance; as the
Form, or Nature, or Soul, or some Vegetative part of the Soul: which kind of
principle, we have said, is in the Egg.

Moreover, because some things from which mutation does proceed, are nearer
causes of it, and some more remote: thereupon sometimes media, the things
between the first efficient, and the last effect, and also the Instruments are
counted Efficients: as also subordinate ends, or the principles of subsequent
things, are ranked amongst efficient causes; and hereupon is it, that some
parts are called Genital parts; as the Heart, from which Aristotle affirms the
other parts to proceed, as is clear also by our History, I say the Heart, or at
lest the rudiment of the Heart; namely, the Vesicula, and Punctum saliens, does
erect and set up the rest of the Body, as a future habitation for it self: and
when it is built, takes possession, enlivens, and swayes it, and fortifies it
with the superaddition of the Ribs, and Breast Bone, as with a Bulwark: and
becomes, as it were, a Tutelar God, the first chamber that entertaines the
soul, the first receptacle of the primigenial heat, and the Vestal
animal-fire; the source and fountain of all the Faculties, and the only solace
in Afflications.

Again, since the Efficient is so called, in order to the Effect; seeing by
Epigenesis some parts are after other in order, and diverse also spring from
those that are before them: it is therefore probable, that as the Effects, so
the Efficients are also diverse; which produce diverse works, from which also
diverse mutations do proceed. So Physicians, in the Physiological part of
Physic, do constitute some Instruments of Chylification, some of
Sanguification, and some of Generation: and some Anatomists, an Ossifical,
Carnifical, and a Nervifical faculty; which they depute to make the Bones, the
Flesh, and the Nerves.

But in the Generation of the Chicken, the efficient causes must needs differ,
by reason of the several actions relating to it, which differ very much; which,
though they may seem Efficientes per accidens, contingent Efficients of
Generation, yet are they necessarily required, since nothing could be done
without their associat aid. For while they remove external Impediments, or do
cherish, or awaken the conception, and de potentia in actum deducunt, raise it
from possibility into actual being, they are justly styled efficients. And in
this Roll, the Incubation of the Hen, the temper and warmth of the Place, and
Air, the Springtime, and the approach of the Sun by the Zodiac, may be well
listed: as also the preparing causes, which cause the Yolk to ascend, the
Macula to be dilated, and the resolution, or melting of the humors in the
Egg, may be mustered amongst efficients.

And then the Generative and Architectonical faculties, which Fabricius calls
parts, are to be numbered with the efficient causes; as, the Immutatrix,
Concoctrix, Formatrix, and Auctrix, the Altering, Concocting, Forming, and
Augmenting faculty; as also those causes that are efficients in the Accidents
relating to the Chicken, as that, by which the Chicken is either a Cock or a
Hen, resembling the He or Shee-parent: and that in relation to the form of
the Cock which was concerned in the former, or latter coition: whence it comes
to pass that the Chicken is an animal, and that an entire one, and not
dismembered, sturdy, and sound, not diseased, and crasie, but a long liver; and
retaining the Species, or degenerating from it; or proves a Monster, or of a
mixed race.

Lastly, since in treating of the efficient cause of the foetus, we discover
the notable structure of it, and the actions, functions, uses, and benefits of
all the parts and members, and with what prudence, skill, and judgment, by how
divine an inspiration all things are managed, and artificially composed for the
advantage of Life: we must not only amuse our selves in inquiring, which is the
Efficient, Architect, and Projector, but also adore, and admire the Omnipotent
Author and Preserver of so great a Fabric (as justly merits the title of a
Microcosme.) We also enquire, when, and whence it proceeds; and where this
divine Vicar, and Viceroy of the deity, which is analogous to the substance of
Stars, and near allied to Art, and Intellect, takes up its residence, and keeps
its Court.

It is apparent therefore by what has been said, that it is a difficult thing
to enumerate all the efficient causes of the Pullus: and we must needs refer
the fuller disquisition of the thing to a general consideration; nor is it
possible to treat fully and profitably of those things which agree to all in
general, out of the single generation of the Chicken (without a clearer light
borrowed by experience from other Animals.) And that the rather, because
Aristotle himself has recounted so many various efficient principles of
Animals: For sometimes he ordaines Metaphys. 1. 2. and 4. 1.
the Male the chief efficient cause, as in whom the Ratio pulli, the Reason or
ground of the Made Chicken consists: according to that, Meta. 7. 10.
all things are made by the same Univocal. Sometimes, De par. an. 1. 1.
the Males seed: or De genesis an. 1. 20.
the Nature of the Male ejecting seed. Sometimes, Ibid. l. 2. c. 3.
that which is in the seed, causing seed to be fruitful; namely, the Spirit,
and the nature in that Spirit, answerable in proportion to the substance of the
Stars. Else where, l. 5. c. 3.
heat, l. 4. c. 2.
moderate heat, l. 4. c. 4.
a certain proportionable degree of heat, De par. an. 2. 2.
the heat in the Blood; and in some places, the heat of the Ambient Air.
Likewise De genesis an. 4. 2.
the Winds, the Sun, the Heavens, Jupiter, the Soul, and in general, Nature,
which is the Principle of Motion and Rest. And so by the same rule, Any of the
Stoics, who thought the Soul to be fire, may decree fire the efficient cause
of Animals; because fire does nourish and augment it self, and seems in some
sort to live at its own dispose De genesis and corrup. l. 2. c. 30.
and liberty: though not our destructive culinary fire, but the Natural,
Celestial, Vegetative, De genesis an. l. 2. c. c.
Generating, and Healthy fire, which the Heathen worshipped by the name of
Jupiter, whom they called the Father of Men and Things; not his lame Brother
Vulcan, (whose aid and benefit we notwithstanding daily use in several
employments to our great advantage) but the divine, Animal Spirit, the Author
of Living creatures.

And therefore Aristotle says, That this question concerning the Efficient is
very dubious; namely, Whether it be an extrinsecal thing, or something inserted
in the Geniture or Seed: and Whether it be a part of the soul, or the soul, or
something which has a soul.

Wherefore that we may deliver and rid our selves of the maze and labyrinth of
the manifold Efficient causes, in this disquisition of the Efficient of the
Chicken, we have need of Ariadnes Clew, woven and cunningly wrought of the
Observations of almost all Creatures living. And therefore it is to be deferred
to a more general Inquest. In the mean time, we shall recount those things,
which relating to the particular generation of the Chicken out of the egg, do
manifestly appear, or are strangers to the common persuasion, or else do
require any further search.

How the Efficient cause of the Chicken does operate, according to Aristotle.
EXERCIT. XLVII.
ALl men generally confess the Male to be the primary efficient cause in
Generation; as in whom the Species or Form resides: And they farther affirm,
that his Geniture being emitted in coition does cause both the being, and
fertility of the Egg. But how the seed of the Cock does produce the chicken
out of the Egg, neither the Ancient nor Modern Philosophers and Physicians
have sufficiently explained, nor yet solved the question proposed by Aristotle.
Nay Aristotle himself has not done it. He says, The Male does not conduce to
the Quantity, but the Quality; and is Principium Motus, the De genesis an l. 1. c.
20.
Principle of Mutation; but the Female contributes the matter. And a while
after: Every Male does not emit seed, nor is it any part of the Foetus, in
those that do emit it: As nothing which passes from the Carpenter contributes
to the matter of the Wood; nor is there any part of the Carpenters art in that
which is made, but the form and species does exist in the matter per motum ab
illo, by the motion or mutation which proceeds from him. Now the soul in which
the form and knowledge is, moves the hands, or other members, by the motion of
a certain quality; which motion is either diverse, in such as make a diverse
thing, or the same in such as make the same. But the hands and instruments move
the matter. So the Nature of the Male which emitteth seed, imployes that seed,
as an Instrument, and having motion actually in it, as in the productions of
Art the Instruments are moved; for in them, in some sort, the motion of Art is
implanted.

By which words he seems to imply, that Generation is made by the motion of a
certain Quality. As in Art, though the first cause (namely ratio operis, the
reason or ground of the work) be in the soul of the Artist; yet afterward the
work is effected by the motion of the hands, or other Instruments; and though
the first cause be removed (as in automatis, things that seem to move of
themselves) yet is it in some sort said to move that, which at present it does
not touch, but has touched formerly, so long as the motion goes on in the
Instruments.

And in the following Book he has these words: The seed of the Male when now
it has access Lib. 2. c. 4.
into the womb of the Female, it does coagulate, and cause a consistence in the
purest part of the excrement (meaning the menstruous blood residing in the
womb) and does transmute the matter which lies ready in the womb by such a
motion or mutation, that at last, though the seed vanish after the motion is
performed, some part of the foetus is existent, and that an animate part (as
the heart) which now does augment and dispose it self, as a Son who is free
from his Father, and has taken a house of his own. It is necessary therefore
that there be some principle by which afterward the order of the members may
be delineated, and all things disposed, which pertain to the absolution and
complement of the Animal; and from which growth and motion may arrive to the
rest of the parts, and be the author of all the similar and dissimilar parts,
and of their last aliment. For that which is now an Animal, does increase; but
the last aliment of the Animal is blood, or something proportionable to blood,
whose vessels and receptacles are the Veins. Now the principle or original of
the veins is the Heart. But the Veins like Roots extend even to the womb, by
which the Foetus draws his aliment. The Heart also being the beginning of the
whole nature, and also the containing End, ought to be made first, as being a
genital part of its own nature; which must needs be the first, as the original
of the rest, and of the whole Animal, and of Sense: in whose heat (because all
the parts are in the matter potentially) since the principle of motion did
abide, that which follows afterward, is stirred up by it, as in those
self-moving miracles; and the parts are moved, not shifting their places, but
altering in softness, hardness, heat, and other distinctions of similar parts,
being now actually made, which were potentially before.

This is Aristotle's opinion almost word for word, by which he conceives the
foetus to be made of seed by motion; though it do not at present continue
touching it, but has touched it formerly: a nice opinion, and of a fine
thread; and according to those things which are discovered in the order of the
generation of the parts, not improbable. For the heart, together with the
ramifications of the Veins, is discerned first; as being an animate principle,
in which both sense and motion reside; and being also like a free Son, and a
Genital part, by which the order of the member is delineated, and all things
conducing to the accomplishment of an Animal, are disposed, and having all
those attributes which Aristotle bestows upon it.

But it seems impossible that the heart should be made in the egg by the males
seed; since that seed is neither in the egg, nor does touch, nor ever did
touch it: because it neither enters the womb (where the egg is made) as
Fabricius confesses, nor is any way attracted by it; and besides this, the
mothers blood is not in the egg neither, nor any other prepared matter, out of
which the males seed might form this first genital part, the author of all the
rest. Nor yet presently upon coition (while the seed as yet remains within,
and is tangent) does any particle of the chicken exist, but many days after,
upon Incubation. And it is likewise improbable too, that in fishes, where the
males geniture only touches the egg on the outside, but does not enter into
it, that the geniture should have any more operation and power upon it, (since
it is merely an external Agent) then the Cocks seed has upon the Hens eggs
which are now perfectly formed.

Again, since presently after coition there is no track of the egg extant, but
that it is afterward generated by the Hen by her self, and that prolifical
too, when now the Cocks seed is clean gone and vanished; it is unlikely that
the foetus should be made by that seed in that egg, by one single motion, or
by successive motions.

Nor do prolifical eggs differ from improlifical, and subventaneons in this,
that the former contain the Cocks seed (as Aldrovandus would have it;) nor is
there found any thing done or coagulated in the egg by the seed of the male,
or any sensible alteration made, (for there is no sensible difference at all
between a prolifical, and an addle egg) and yet a prolifical, which is
conceived a long time after coition, contains in it the power of both Sexes,
and the capacity of being made, and of making a chicken: as if it had deduced
its original from the coition of both Sexes, and their consent and conspiring
together in one, as Aristotle would have it; De genesis an. l. 1 c. 18.
who being pressed by that argument, (as we have declared before concerning the
generation of the egg) did constitute a soul in the egg; which if it be
there, must without scruple be the principle and efficient, of all those things
which are naturally met with in the egg. For it is most certain, What thing
soever at last it prove which does procreate the chicken out of the egg, (in
whose fabric so much skill, so divine contrivance and providence is required;
fitting eyes for sight, the bill for reception of the meat, the feet for
walking, the wings for flight, and all the other Utensils for some emploiment
or other) that it is either a soul, or else something more worthy and excellent
then a soul, working by wisdom and providence.

And by the generation of the chicken it is also manifest, that whatsoever be
the principium vitae, the first cause of life, and vegetation, was first of all
in the heart. Wherefore, if it be the soul of the Chicken, it is plain that it
also was in the Punctum saliens, and in the Blood; because we discover motion
and sense there: for it moves and dances like an Animal; so that if the soul
do exist in the Punctum saliens, building, nourishing, and enlarging the rest
of the body, (as we have showed in our History) Then it flows from the Heart
as from the Springhead into the whole body.

Likewise if the Egg be therefore Prolifical because de genesis an. l. 2. c. 4.
it has a soul, or (as Aristotle would have it) a part of the Vegetative soul;
it is plain, that the Punctum saliens, and the Genital animate part, do
proceed from the Soul of the egg; (for nothing is the Author of it self) and
that the soul is derived from the egg into the Punctum saliens, by and by into
the Heart, and at length into the Chicken.

Add to these, if the egg have a prolifical virtue, and Vegetative soul, by
which it erects a Pullus; and do owe them (as it is plain it does, and all men
confess it) to the seed of the Cock; it is then certain that this Seed is
Animate: For so Aristotle: Whether the seed have a soul or no; there is the
same reason Ibid. l. 2. c. 1.
to be given for it as for the Parts. For no soul can be in any thing but in
that whose soul it is; nor can there be any part which is not partaker of the
soul: unless it be an aequivocal part, as the eye of a dead man. That therefore
the seed has a soul, and a being in potentia, is clear.

It therefore follows out of what has been said, that the Male is the Primary
Efficient, in which Ratio, and forma, the Reason and Form is; which Efficient
begets a prolifical seed, or Geniture rather, and that Geniture endowed with a
Vegetative soul, (with which also its other parts are endowed) he does transmit
into the female. This Geniture being transmitted, it moves the Matter in the
Hen, that so an Animate egg may be produced; by which means the first particle
of the Chicken is animated, and afterward the whole Chicken. So that according
to Aristotle, either the same soul is conveied by a Metempsychosis, from the
Cock into his Geniture, from his Geniture into the substance of the Hen, from
thence into the egg, and from the egg into the Chicken; or else is raised up
in the subsequent by the precedent things, namely by the Male, in his proper
seed; by the seed, in the egg: and at last by the egg, in the Chicken, tanquam
lumen de lumine, as light derived from light.

The Efficient therefore which is sought for in the egg, from whence the
Chicken is born, is a soul; and the soul of the Egg: for according to
Aristotle, the soul is only in that thing, whose soul it is.

But it is manifest that the Seed of the Male is not the Efficient of the
Chicken, neither an Instrument, by whose motion the Chicken might be formed,
(as Aristotle would have it) nor as an Animate substance, as if the soul were
its soul. For in the egg there is no seed at all, either now touching it, or
that ever did touch it, (and it is impossible that that should move, which does
not touch; Ibid.
or that any thing should be affected by that, which does not move it) and
therefore the seeds soul ought not to be said to be in it. And yet though the
soul be the Efficient in the Egg, yet it does not appear to be derived rather
from the Cock, or his seed, then from the Hen.

Nor is it transferred by a Metempsychosis, or certain translation of the soul
from the Cock and his seed, into the egg, and thence into the Chicken? For how
can it be translated into the Eggs that are yet to come, and to be conceived
after Coition? Unless some Animate Seed do lurk in the Hen all the while; or
else the soul only without seed be translated, that so it may be afterward
infused into the Egg when the Egg shall be made. But neither of these is true.
For the seed is no where found in the Hen: nor is it possible that the Hen
should after Coition possess two souls; namely, her own, and the soul of the
future eggs, and Chickens: for the soul is never said to be, but in that whose
soul it is: much less can one, or more souls lie lurking in the Hen, that so
they may attend the future eggs and chickens which are to be born in their
order.

We have deduced these passages out of Aristotle, that from them it might
appear, how the Cocks seed does, according to him, produce the Chicken out of
the Egg, that so some light might be afforded to this perplexed disquisition.
But seeing they do not explain how this business is accomplished, nor yet
salve his own objections; we are still sticking in the same mire, and involved
in the same doubts, (concerning the Efficient cause of the Foetus, in the
Generation of Animals) nay so far are we from receiving any clear satisfaction,
that we are rather more perplexed, and to seek, then we were before. And
therefore no wonder this excellent Philosopher was in the streights concerning
this matter, and did therefore range together so many several sorts of
efficient causes of Animals, and sometims betake himself to examples drawn from
Automata, things seeming to move of themselves, sometimes to coagulatedmatter,
sometimes to Art, Instruments, and Motion; sometimes to the soul in the egg,
and in the seed of the Male, (to illustrate the thing) and where he seems to be
positive and settle upon some determination, concerning what it may be, that
should render the Seed, (be it of Plants, or Animals) fertile; he renounces
Heat and Fire, as improper Agents; nor does he admit any such like faculty; nor
can he find out any thing in the seed it self, which should be fit for the
undertaking; but is compelled to admit of a certain Incorporeal extrinsecal
thing, which should (like Art, or the Mind) form the foetus by wisdom and
providence, and ordain and institute all things relating to it, to some end and
purpose, and to its better subsistence. He takes, I say, sanctuary, in an
obscure and ignote thing; namely, in a spirit contained in the seed and frothy
substance, and a certain nature in that spirit answerable in proportion to the
substance of the Stars. But what that should be, he no where reveals.

Fabricius his Opinion concerning the Efficient cause of the Chicken is
confuted.
EXERCIT. XLVIII.
SInce I have proposed Aristotle, the chiefest of the old Philosophers, and
Hieronymus Fabricius ab Aquapendente, an eminent Anatomist amongst the Modern,
to be my Leaders, that from them I might chiefly be enlightened concerning the
generation of Animals, and since I cannot better my self by Aristotle, I have
resolved to set upon Fabricius, to see what account he can give of it.

Now he attempts to give resolution to three doubts arising in the case:
namely, First, What is the Efficient of the Chicken? and that he concludes to
be the Males seed. 2. How this appears in the egg to be so, and by what means
the Cocks seed does rinder the egg fertile? Lastly, In what Order are the
parts of the Chicken procreated?

As for the first, it appears out of our Observations, that the Cock and his
seed are indeed the Efficicient cause of Generation, but not the adaequate
cause; but that the Hen also comes in for a share.

In this place therefore we must chiefly enquire, how the Cocks seed does
fructify the Egg, and raise a Chicken out of it, which would else be
subventaneous, and improlifical.

But let us give ear to Fabricius: Those creatures, page 38.
says he, that are produced out of an egg, are different from those which are
born out of seed; in this, that Oviparous creatures have a matter, out of which
the Chicken is corporated, distinct and separate from the Agent: but Viviparous
creatures have both the material and efficient cause adjoined, and
concorporated together. For the Agent in Oviparous creatures, is the seed of
the Cock in the feathered kind, which neither is, nor can be in the Egg: but
the matter out of which the Chicken is corporated, is the Chalaza. These two
are much distant one from another; for the Chalaza is in the Yolk now formed,
and fallen into the second Uterus, and is adjoined intimately to the egg: on
the contrary, the Cocks seed remains near the fundament, and is removed from
the Chalaza by a large chasme, and yet by its irradiating faculty it fructifies
both the Uterus, and all the egg. But in a Viviparous animal, the seed is both
the Matter, and the Efficient too, both being contracted into one body.

He seems to have introduced this difference between Oviparous and Viviparous
Animals; that so he might countenance the opinion of Physicians concerning the
Generation of Man, or at least not subvert it; who conceive that the seeds of
both Sexes, ejected together in coition are mingled, and according as the one
prevails over the other, so the one approves it self the Efficient, and the
other submits it self to become the Matter; so that they both conspiring
together, do constitute the conception in Viviparous Animals.

But when he had observed, that neither Seed nor Blood is attracted by means of
coition into the womb of the Hen, nor contained there, and could not believe,
that any thing emitted from the cock in coition, could possibly arrive so
far, nor could find any thing in the Egg, that is adjoined to the males
seed, he was enforced to doubt, how the seed (which is no where present with,
nor mingled amongst the feminine geniture, nor is adjoined to it, nor does so
much as touch it at all) should constitute the Chicken, or fructify the Egg?
especially when he had before delivered, that from some premised coitions, all
the eggs that were to be laid that year, were made prolifical. For how could
it choose but seem impossible, that from the seed of the cock received in the
Spring (but now departed, lost, and consumed) the posthume eggs (laid possibly
in Summer or Autumn) should be rendered fruitful, and produce chickens?

That he might rid his hands of this grand difficulty, he coined the foresaid
distinction; and to ratify his opinion, he adds three farther Assertions:
First, that though the cocks seed were neither in the Egg, nor at any time in
the Womb, nor adjoined to the material cause, (as it is in Viviparous Animals)
yet it continues for a whole year in the hen. Secondly, to reserve this seed
in, he invents a dark perforation, near the door of the Womb, wherein the cock
should deposite his seed, and in which (as in a pouch) it should be concluded;
that thence all the eggs might receive their fertility. Lastly, though the seed
in that pouch, neither touch the womb, the egg, nor the Ovary, that by that
means it might fructify the egg, or raise a Chicken out of it; yet, he says,
that it gains addresses into the very egg, by the insinuation, or irradiation
of a certain spiritual substance in it, and by those arts does fructify the
Chalazae, and so model a Chicken. And yet by that assertion lie seems to
confirm Aristotle's opinion (who assures us that the female contributes the
matter, and the male the efficiency to generation) which is contrary to the
Physicians position concerning the commixture of seeds: for whose sake he seems
to have introduced his foresaid distinction between Oviparous, and Viviparous
Animals. And that this his opinion may seem more probable, he recites what
changes and alterations the seed reserved in the Testicles and seminary
Vesicles, not yet emitted, does procure in Animals.

But to take no notice that all this makes little to his purpose: (for the
question in chief is not, How the Cocks seed does render the egg fertile? but
rather, How it does frame and erect a Chicken out of the Egg?) all those
things which he has conjured up to guard his opinion, seem for the most part
false, or very suspicious; as appears by our Observations delivered in this
History. For neither is that blind perforation in the root of the rump (which
he calls the purse, or pouch) destined to cubbard up the Cocks seed, nor is
there (as we have said) any seed at all found in it: but it is an empty
unprovided thing both in the Cock, and Hen.

But what he would have by his spiritual substance, and irradiation, he is yet
to acquaint us, as also what substance he understands that to be, which he
affirms, does by its virtue vivifie the egg, Whether a corporeal, or formal
substance, which should proceed from the irradiation of the seed, (which lies
at roost in the pouch) and (which is chiefly required) should fashion the
Chicken out of the egg.

To conclude, in my mind, he says no more in substance then this: It makes
the Chicken, because it irradiates the Egg; and forms it, because it vivifies
it: and so he labors to reveal and illustrate the obscure manner of formation,
by one more obscure then it self. For the same scruple returns entire; namely,
how the Cocks seed, a mere nontangent, an external efficient, and disjoined by
place, remaining in the pouch, can fashion the interior parts (that is, the
Heart, Liver, Lungs, and Guts, etc.) in the egg out of the Chalazae, by
Irradiation? Unless he will have it sitting in its chair of State, like the
Creator of all, only by this word of comman, Fiant, Let all things be so;
(namely the Bones for Support, the Muscles for Motion, the Organs for Sense;
the Members for Action, the Intrals for Concoction, and the like) and so order,
and by its beams or influence constitute all things to their proper end, with
providence, wisdom, and art. For neither does Fabricius expound the manner, nor
yet demonstrate the seed to be of such force and virtue, that (without coming
near) it can effect all this; especially since an egg can, by Incubation of a
stranger foul, or any other fostering warmth; as in dung, in a matt, or an
oven, though never so remote from the pouch of its own mother-hen, be
quickened, and produce a foetus.

The same difficulty therefore lies still upon our hands; namely, How the Cocks
seed is the Efficient cause of the Chicken? nor is it any whit salved by the
influence of this spiritual substance. For though we should grant, that the
seed is reserved in the purse, and that by a Metamorphosis, and Irradiation, it
did corporate the chicken out of the Chalazae: yet the scruple would stick no
less by us; namely, How the Intrals of the Chicken are modelled. But these
things are long since confuted by us.

Wherefore, when we are in quest of the efficient cause of the Chicken, we must
look for it in the Egg, and not dormant in a pouch; and for such a one, which,
though the egg now grown stale, were distant many miles from the Hen, and laid
under an other Hen (as a Turkey-hen, or African-hen) to be hatched; or (as in
Egypt) under warm sand, or dung, or in an Oven proper for the purpose, would
still raise up a chicken, of the same species, and very like the Cock and Hen
that were its natural parents; or else (in case the Cock were of a different
kind) a mungrel offspring, of a mixed species, and resemblance.

Wherefore the knot remains to be united, which neither Aristotle nor Fabricius
have loosened; namely, How the seed of the Male, or Cock, does produce the
chicken out of the egg, or is to be named the Efficient cause of the chicken,
especially, since it is neither present, tangent, nor adjoined to the Egg? And
though almost all men conclude, that the Male, and its seed are the Efficient
cause of the Foetus; no man yet has sufficiently declared, how it can be done,
especially in our Hen-egg.

The Efficient cause of the Chicken, is hard to be found out.
EXER. XLIX.
THe disquisition of the Efficient is exceeding difficult; (as we have said)
and that the rather, because so many names are attributed to it. Whereupon
Aristotle does recount very many efficient causes of Animals: And many
controversies are risen amongst authors; chiefly, between Physicians and
Aristotelians, who contend very earnestly about it; endeavoring by different
opinions to explain both the Efficient cause, and the manner of its Efficiency.

And indeed the Omnipotent Creator, does in none of his works more manifestly
reveal the presence of his Deity, then in the Fabric and Structure of
Animals. And though it be a known thing, subscribed by all, that the foetus
assumes its original and birth from the Male and Female, and consequently that
the Egg is produced by the Cock and Hen, and the Chicken out of the Egg:
yet neither the Schools of Physicians, nor Aristotle's discerning Brain, have
disclosed the manner, how the Cock and its seed, does mint and coin the
Chicken out of the Egg. For it is evident enough, by what we have delivered,
concerning the Generation of Oviparous Animals, and others, that neither the
Opinion of Physicians, deducing Generation from the mixture of the Seeds of
both Sexes, nor Aristotle's neither, establishing the seed of the Male for the
Efficient, and the Menstruous Blood for the material Cause, are to be embraced:
because that neither in Coition, nor presently upon Coition, any thing does
part from the Female into the Cavity of the Uterus; out of which, as out of the
Matter, any thing relating to the Foetus should be suddenly produced: nor does
the Geniture of the Male (whether it be animate it self, or an animate
Instrument) enter into the Womb, or is attracted thither, or any where else
reserved in the Female, but does either vanish, or retract: nor is there any
thing else to be found in the Uterus presently after Coition, which issuing
either from the Male or Female, may be fansied to be the Matter or Original of
the future Foetus. Nor is the Cocks seed surviving in Fabricius his Pouch, or
any where else in the Hen; that thence, either by the irradiation and
influence of spiritual substance, or by contact the egg is made, or a Chicken
out of the Egg. Nor does the Hen contribute any other seed, then the Papulae,
the Yolk, and the Egg. And therefore the contemplation is rendered more
intricate by our Observations; because by them all those suppositions, upon
which both the other opinions were supported, are thrown down to the ground.
But especially, when we shall anon demonstrate, that all Animals are alike
generated out of an Egg; and that in Coition (whether of Viviparous, Brutes,
or Men) no Seed or Blood, proceeding from either Male or Female, is entertained
in the Hollow of the Womb, or drawn up thither before Coition, or in Coition,
or after Coition is found in the Womb, which may be conceived to be the Matter
Efficient, or Principle of the future Foetus.

Daniel Sennertus, a late learned Man, and a careful Inquirer into Nature,
having first balanced other men's opinions, attempts at last to resolve the
business; concluding that the Soul is in the Seed, and that it is the very same
Soul with that, which afterward informs the Infant: so that he makes no
scruple to affirm that the Rational soul of man, is present in his Seed: and
that therefore the Egg possesses the Soul of the Chicken: and that the soul is
conveied with the Seed into the Womb of the Female: and from that seed of both
Sexes conjoined (as one flame to another) but not mixed (for mixture, says he,
respects things of diverse Species) but endowed with a soul, a perfect Animal
does result. And therefore, says he, the Seed of both Sexes is required, both
to the constitution of an Infant, and of an egg. And thus, (like one that had
subdued all difficulties) He conceives, he has delivered a certain and
perspicuous Truth.

But, granting that there is a Soul in the egg, and that soul united and made
up of the souls of the Parents, and sometimes proceeding from Parents of of
several kinds, as from a Mare and an Ass, from a Dunghil-Hen and a
Cock-Pheasant; and that it is not Mixed, but United; and that the Chicken
(after the manner of the Seed of Vegetables) is made by that efficient soul,
being afterward preserved by it, all its life long: so that it be counted
absurd to affirm, that the foetus is cherished by one soul out of the Uterus,
or egg; and by another in the Uterus or egg: suppose, I say, we grant all
this (though it be invalid, and doubtful) yet our History of the Generation out
of the Egg, does utterly subvert, and confute as false the very foundation and
basis upon which all his doctrine leans, and relies: Which is this, That the
egg is constituted of the Seed of Cock and Hen: or, that the seed is
transmitted from both into the Uterus: or that the foetus, or any part of it is
formed of the seed so entertained by the womb, or cast into it: or, that the
seed of the Cock (as an Efficient cause, or Operatour) is any where reserved in
the Hen, which (as he conceives) draws matter and nutriment from her into the
Womb, to support the foetus which it has made. For the conditions which he
himself according to Aristotle reputes necessary, will be found wanting:
namely, that the foetus ought to be made of that which actually is in being,
and does pre-exist: and that the Chicken is nourished by that which is present
with it, and in the same place where it self is first constituted: As also,
that it should be made by that which does operate being immediately conjoined
to it; and ought to be the same thing, by which the chicken is preserved, and
augmented all its lifetime. For the cocks seed (whether Animate, or Inanimate,
it matters nothing) is not at all in the Egg, not in the Uterus, present, and
conjoined; nor in the matter whence the chicken is framed, as neither in the
Chicken it self now begun, that so it may either frame, or perfect it.

He miscarries likewise, when he goes about to illustrate his opinion
concerning the Animal seed, by allusion to that of Plants, and Mast: because he
did not understand the difference alleged by Aristotle, between the Geniture
proceedings by coition, and the first conception made out of both Sexes; nor
did observe that an egg might be first conceived in the Cluster of the
Vitellary (without the translation of any Geniture from Male and Female into
the Uterus.) Nor did he apprehend that the Uterus, even for some time after
Coition, is quite void of any matter at all, either transmitted from the
Parents, or made by Coition, or occasioned any other way. Nor had he read, or
at least observed Fabricius his experiment; namely, that after some Coitions of
the Cock, the Hen may be so fructified, that from that time for the whole
succeeding year she may lay all Prolifical Eggs: though she have not in the
interim conversed with the cock, whereby each particular egg might receive
fecundity; nor yet retained so long the seed she formerly received.

This is agreed upon by universal consent; that all Animals whatsoever, which
arise from Male and Female, are generated by the coition of both Sexes; and so
begotten as it were per contagium aliquod, by a kind of contagion. In like
manner as Physicians observe, that contagious diseases (as the Leprosy, the
Pox, the Plague, and Pthisick) do propagate their infection, and beget
themselves in bodies yet sound and untoucht, merely by an extrinsecal contact;
nay sometimes only by the breath, and per (...), by inquination; and that at a
distance, through an inanimate medium, and that medium no way sensibly altered.
So that, that which had the first touch, begets an Univocal like it self, not
as touching at this instant, nor yet now actually in being, nor as present, or
conjoined, but merely because it once has touched. Of so great operation and
energy is Contagion. And perhaps the same thing obtains in the Generation of
Animals. For Fishes eggs, which acquire their growth abroad at their own
dispose, without any Male-seed, (and therefore do without all doubt live
without it) being besprinkled with the Males prolifical milkey substance, and
only tinctured from without, do generate fishes. It Is not, I say, an
intromission, or intimate reception of the masculine seed into each particular
egg, which sets it a work about the fabric of bodies, or introduces the soul,
but a bare contact. Whereupon Aristotle calls lac maris, the Males milk, or
Hist. an. l. 6. c. 13.
genital seed cast into water, sometimes genital, and propagating liquor: and
sometimes Vital Venom. For says he, The Masculine fish sprinckles the eggs
with genital seed, and those eggs which that Vitale Virus, Vital or quickening
Venom touches, out of them are born fishes. It being therefore laid down as an
undoubted principle, that the foetus is made by Contagion, there will a weighty
doubt arise; namely, how bare Contagion can be the author of so great a work?
and how the parents can by that generate issues like themselves; or the males
seed produce an Univocal like that creature from which it proceeded? since
after contact it bids adieu, and is no longer in being, or touching, or present
at all, but clean corrupted, and a Non-ens. How, say I, can a Non-ens act? or a
Non-tangens erect a fabric like it self? or that which is dead it self, impart
a life to another thing, and merely upon this account, that the time was when
it did touch.

For Aristotle's argumentation seems false, or de genesis an. l. 1. c. 6.
lame at least, where he contends: That Generation cannot be without an Agent
and a Patient: and those things cannot act and suffer, which do not mutually
touch each other: but those things do mutually touch, which having each their
particular magnitude and place apart, have their extremities meeting one
another.

But since the case is plain, that Contagion (where the things touch not, nor
have their extremities kissing one another) can destroy living creatures, what
should hinder, but that it should be as powerful, to conduce to the life and
generation of animals.? The Efficient in an Egg, by a plastical virtue
(because the male did but only touch, though he now be far from touching, and
have no extremity reached out toward it) does frame and set up a foetus in its
own species and resemblance. And this author of fecundity, this peircing power
is translated through so many mediums or instruments, that one cannot pattern
it, neither by that mutation procured by instruments (as in the productions of
Art) nor by Aristotle's Automata, nor our Clocks or Watches; nor by the instance
of a King in his own dominions, where his command is every where a law; nor can
you ratify this our doctrine, by introducing a soul into the seed or geniture.

And hereupon many controversies, and problemes are started concerning the
attractive power of the Lodestone and Jet: concerning Sympathy, and Antipathy,
concerning Poison, and the contagion of pestilential diseases: concerning
Alexipharmacal Medicines, and such as cure or kill from an occult (or rather
ignote) quality and propriety: all which seem to execute their pleasures
without any touching. And chiefly this. What is there in generation, that by a
momentany touch (nay not touching at all, unless through the sides of many
mediums) can orderly constitute the parts of the Chicken by an Epigenesis, and
produce an Univocal creature, and its own like? and for no other reason, but
because it touched heretofore. How, I say, can that which is not present, and
did only touch outwardly, constitute, orderly dispose and limne all the
members of the Chicken, in an egg which is now exposed to the wide world, and
oftentimes transported a great way off. For nothing can make and generate it
self into another likeness.

What the Efficient cause of Animals is; and what its Conditions.
EXERCIT. L.
THat therefore we may in some proportion dive into the knowledge of the
efficient cause, (so far forth as concerns our present contemplation) we must
take notice first of the Instruments or Mediums which pertain to the efficient
or forming cause: and into this rank is the Male and Female for to be reduced,
likewise the Geniture, and the egg, and its first rudiment. For some males (and
females too) are barren, or unfruitful. And likewise the males geniture is
sometimes more, and sometimes less fertile: for the Semen Virile as it is
barely contained in the Seminal Vesicles (except it be rarefied into froth by
the spirits, and forceably leap out) is unfruitful. And this too, possibly is
not always successful. Nor are the Papulae, or Yolks bred in the Cluster of the
Ovary, or the Eggs contained in the Womb, all presently fruitful.

Now I call that fruitful, which (except some impediment happen from without)
will attain its designed end, by the efficient power implanted in it, and
compass that, for whose sake it is ordained. So that Cock is reputed fertile,
who causes his Hens to lay oftener, and more constantly, and also renders their
eggs generative.

So likewise that Hen is fruitful, which is useful in laying eggs, and has a
good retention in order to the prolifical virtue imparted to her from the Cock.
So the Cluster of the Papulae, and Ovary it self are counted fertile, when they
are well fraught with store of rudiments and foundations of eggs, and those
mature.

Likewise that egg is fertile, which is farthest from being subventaneous or
addle, and does less fail in producing a Chicken, howsoever you dispose of it,
either to Incubation, or any other fostering-heat.

Therefore such an efficient of the Chicken is required, as may impart virtue
to all these, by which they may be fructified, and obtain an efficient power;
for the same thing, or at least something proportionable to it, is in them all,
bestowing fecundity upon them. And the Inquiry is the same, namely, what it is
in the Egg, that renders it fertile: what in the Ovary, and what in the
Papula; likewise what in the female, and lastly in the seed and Cock himself,
etc. What in the Blood, and Punctum saliens, or first genital particle, from
whence afterward the rise, fabric, and order of all the other parts is
derived: as also, what is it in the Chicken it self, from whence it grows
sturdy and active, attains its youth and maturity, lives a healthy life, and a
long.

Nor is that inquiry unlike this, which demands, what both male, and female
(Cock and Hen) confer to the fertile egg; or what it is which proceeds from
both, toward the perfection and similitude of the chicken; as whether the
egg, conception, matter, and nutriment proceed from the female, and the
Operative virtue from the male; whether a certain contagion sent forth by
coition, or created by it, or received from it, remaining in the Hen or Eggs,
work upon the matter of the egg; or attract a nutriment from the Hen,
concocting and distributing it, to the increase of the egg, and afterward to
the production of the chicken: Or lastly, whether all that which relates to the
form, soul, and fecundity, do proceed from the male; but from the female,
whatever relates to the matter, constitution, place, and sustenance. For in
animals (whose Sexes are distinct) it is so contrived, that because the female
cannot alone generate, nourish, and protect the foetus, the male is joined as
yoke fellow in the task (as the Superior, and more eminent progenitor) to
supply her failings; and so to correct the infirmity of the Subventaneous eggs,
and inspire them with fertility.

For as a chicken born of an egg, is indebted to that egg for his body, soul,
and principal or genital part: So is the egg for all it has, to the Hen; and
the Hen also for her fecundity to the Cock.

But whether the male be the first and principal cause of the progeny, or
whether the male and the female are intermediate and Instrumental causes set
awork by nature, or the first and Supreme Genitor, we have here an occasion
offered to enquire; and it is a very worthy and necessary one, because all
perfect science depends upon the knowledge of all causes: and therefore to the
plenary comprehension of Generation, we must ascend from the last and lowest
efficient to the very first and most supreme, and know them all.

But as for the first and highest Efficient of the chicken, we shall determine
what that is afterward, (when we treat of the Efficient of all other Animals)
but what kind of one it is, we will here declare.

The first condition, or qualification, of the first and primary Efficient
properly so called, is, that it be the first and principal fructifier, from
whence all intermediate causes assume their derived fecundity. For instance,
the chicken is derived from the Punctum saliens in the egg, not only in regard
of its bulk, but also, and that chiefly in regard of its soul; the Punctum
saliens, or Heart is derived from the egg, the egg from the Hens, and the Hens
fertility from the Cock.

Another requisite or condition of the primary Efficient is desumed ex opere
facto, from the production it self, viz. the Chicken: because that is the prime
efficient, in which the reason of the effect does chiefly appear. But because
every Generative efficient does generate its like, and the issue is of a mixed
nature; the first efficient must needs be mixed too.

Now I therefore pronounce their issue to be of a mixed nature, because, the
mixture of both parents is refulgent in it, both in the figure and lineaments
of the body, and all its parts; as in complexion or colors, moles or spots,
diseases, and other accidents of the body. Likewise in the soul and actions,
and functions (as in like manners, docility, gate, and voice) such a kind of
temperature is discoverable. For as we say that a similar mixed body is made of
the Elements, because their virtues, heat, cold, moisture, and s^ccity, are
found compounded in the same similar body: so likewise the paternal and
maternal handiwork may be tracked and pointed out both in the body, soul, and
other accidents of the Chicken: (which follow the temperature, or happen unto
it) for instance; In a Mule, the soul, body, manners, and voice of both
parents; (viz. of the Mare, and the Ass) are apparent. So also in those
Chickens which are the Offspring of the dunghill-hen, and Cock-Pheasant: and in
that mungrel Curre, which is produced by the sodomie of a Wolf and a Bitch.

Since therefore the Chicken resembles both parents, and is a mixed Effect: the
generant primary cause (which it resembles) must needs be mixed likewise.
Therefore that which frames the Chicken in the Egg is a mixed nature (as being
united, or compounded of both) and the work of both parents. And if any
contagion do arise or remain in the female upon coition, (in which they two are
mixed, and become as it were one Animal) that also will be of a mixed nature or
power, by which the egg shall afterward become fertile, and atchieve a
plastical virtue, which is an Agent of a mixed nature, or a mixed
efficient-Instrument, producing a Chicken of a mixed nature also.

The contagion, I say; because Aristotle's persuasion is altogether refractory
to experience her self: namely, where he says, that some part of the Foetus is
instantly made upon coition. Nor is that true neither, which some of the
Moderns aver, namely, that the soul of the future chicken is in the egg: for
that is no whit the chickens soul, which is in no part of the chickens body.
Nor can the soul be said either to be begotten, or left behind presently upon
coition: for otherwise there should be two souls in a Woman with child.
Therefore till it be determined what the efficient of the egg is, which is of
a mixed nature, and ought to remain present upon coition: give me leave to call
it contagium, Contact, or contagion.

But where the contagion lurks in the female after coition, and how it is
communicated and derived to the egg, requires a more exact Disquisition: and
we will afterward fall upon it, when we treat generally of the conception of
females. It shall suffice, in the mean time to have taken notice, that it must
needs be the fate of the first efficient (in which the reason of the future
offspring does abide) that, since its offspring is mixed, to be of a mixed
nature it self; and either to proceed from both Parents, or from something
which makes use of both (as animate Instruments, cooperative, and mixed, and
molded into one by coition.)

The third condition of the Primary Efficient is, that either it impart motion
successively to all its intermediate instruments, or else employ them
otherwise, but that it self be subservient to none: whence a doubt arises,
whether the Cock be the Primary Efficient in the Generation of the chicken, or
have any before, or superior to him. For all generation seems to be derived
from Heaven, and issue from the motion of the Sun, and Moon. But we will be
positive in this matter, when we have first declared, what an instrument, or
the instrumental efficient cause is, and how divided.

Now Instrumental Efficients are of diverse kinds; some, according to
Aristotle, are factiva, Making, and some, activa, Doing; some do not operate,
but when they are conjoined with a prior efficient, as the hand, foot, and
genital parts; others operate, disjoined, as the Geniture and the Egg: some
Instruments have not motion or action, but what is given them by the first
Efficient; others have proper internal principles of their own, to which nature
affords no motion in generation, but yet employs their faculties, and sets them
the rule, and law of their performances; as the Cook employes fire, and the
Physician herbs, and the virtues of medicines to cures.

Sennertus, to maintain his conceit, concerning the soul in the Seed, and the
formative faculty in the Egg, affirms, that not only the Egg, but the Cocks
seed also, is endowed with the soul of the future Chicken, and is not the
Instrumental Agent, but the principal; absolutely denying that any separate
Efficient, is Instrumental: but pronouncing, that only that is to be reckoned
an Instrument in propriety of speech, which is conjoined with the primary
efficient: and that, that only is an Instrumental efficient, which has no
other motion, or action, then that which is immitted, or continually and
successively received from the primary efficient, by whose power it acts. And
upon that account, he rejects the instance concerning things cast or hurled,
which receiving their force from the thing that does hurl, do yet
notwithstanding move, even when they are separated from it. As if the Sword and
Spear were to be counted Instruments of War, but not Arrows, and Bullets. He
also rejects the instance drawn from a Republic, and denies that the
Magistrates, Counselors, or Officers of a Commonwealth, are the Instruments
of a Nation: And yet Aristotle reckons a Counselor for Polit. l. 1. c. 4.
an Efficient, and calls on Officer an Instrument, in plain terms. He likewise
decries the instance of the Automata, and many other things, that so he may
ratify the seed (or egg) to be Animals, and not an Instrumental, but a
Principal Agent. And yet (as if he were enforced by the truth) he lays down
such conditions for a Principal Agent, as do absolutely prove contrary to his
own forementioned opinion. Whatsoever produces a work, or effect more noble
then it self; or else an effect lake to it self, is not an Efficient, but an
Instrumental cause. Which being granted, who will not conclude, that Seed and
an Egg, are Instruments? Since a chicken is an effect nobler then the egg,
and neither like an Egg, nor Seed. Wherefore, when this most Learned Man
denies the Seed or Egg, to be an Instrument, because they are separated from
the Primary Agent, he stands upon a false bottom. For since the first generant
produces its offspring by several mediums, whether any of those mediums be
conjoined to it, as the Hand to the Artist; or whether it be separated from it,
as the Arrow shot from the Bow; yet both are called Instruments.

From these recited Conditions of the Instrumental cause, it may seem to ensue,
that the cock, or at least the cock with the hen, are the Primary efficients in
the Generation of the chicken: for the chicken is like them; nor can it be
thought to be more noble then its Efficients or Parents. I shall therefore add
one condition more to the Primary efficient, by which perhaps it may appear
that the Male is not the Primary, but the Isntrumental cause; namely, that it
is required of the Primary efficient in the fabric of the Chicken, that he
employ Skill, Providence, Wisdom, Goodness, and Understanding, far above the
capacity of our rational souls; as that, in which the Reason or Idea of the
future work, ought to consist, and which ought likewise to act for some
destinated end, disposing and perfecting all parts, forming the smallest and
most inconsiderable appendixes of the Chicken for some use, and employment: not
providing only for the structure of the creature, but for its welfare,
ornament, and defense.

Now the male, or his seed, either in, or after coition, is not so qualified,
that Art, Understanding, and Providence, may be attributed to it.

Which things being pondered, the Male seems to be an Instrumental efficient,
as well as his seed, and the Hen likewise as well as the Egg she lays. And
therefore we must take our flight to a more Primary, Superior, and more
excellent cause; to which we may justly attribute Providence, Understanding,
Art, and Goodness; and such a one as is as much superior to its effects and
Workmanship, as an Architect is better then a Barn he sets up; a Prince then
his Officers, or an Artist, then his own hands.

And therefore both Male and Female are but Instrumental efficients,
subservient to the high Creator, or Protogenitor. And in this sense it is truly
said, that the Sun, and Man, beget an Animal, because the Spring and Autumn do
ensue upon the Approaching and Receding Sun, at which times commonly, the
generation and corruption of Animals happen. So the chiefest of Philosophers.
The first De Genesis and Corr. l. 2. c. 10.
Movers motion is not the cause of generation and corruption, but the motion of
the Oblique circle: for that is continual, and has also two Motions: for if
generation and corruption were to be always continual, it were necessary that
something should be always moved, least those mutations should fail; but yet it
must have two motions, least one only of the two mutations should succeed. The
cause therefore of the continuity is the motion of the Universe, but the
declivity it self is the cause of the Approach, and the Recesses. For it comes
to pass, that He, (namely the Sun) is sometimes nearer, and sometimes farther
from the earth. And when the Interval is inequal, the motion must be inequal
too. If then he therefore generate because he approaches nearer: and cause
corruption, because he remotes and recedeth farther from the earth: Then it
follows that if he often do generate, it is because he often approaches: and
if he often cause corruption, it is because he often recedeth. For contraries
have contrary causes.

And therefore in the Spring all things flourish and grow; (namely, from the
Approach of the Sun, who is the Common Father, and Parent: or at least the
immediate and Common Instrument in Generation employed by the high Creator) and
that not Vegetables only, but Animals too: nor they only which are
Spontaneous issues, but those also which are generated by Male and Female. As
if at the approach of this noble Planet, soft Venus did descend from the Sky,
with Cupid and the Graces entertained for her Retinue, inciting and provoking
all living things, by their Allegiance to Love, to propagate their kind. Or (as
it is in the Fable) as if Saturn did then become an Eunuch, and threw his
masculine evidences into the Sea, to raise a Foam, which might give birth to
Venus: For in the Generation of Animals, Superat tener omnibus humor; A gentle
dew does moisten all (as the Poet has it) and the genital parts do foam and
strut with Seed.

And therefore the cock and Hen are chiefly fruitful in Spring, as if the Sun,
or Heavens, Nature, the Soul of the Universe, or the Omnipotent Deity (for
these are Synonoma's) were a Superior and Diviner cause of Generation then
they. So, Sol and homo generant hominem; The Sun, and Man beget a Man (that is
to say) the Sun by Man as its Instrument. And so, the Creator of all things,
and the cock, beget an egg, and out of an egg a chicken: namely, by the
constant approach and recesse of the Sun: who according to the will, and decree
of the Almighty, is employed in the generation of all things.

We conclude therefore that the male (though he be a Primary and more excellent
efficient then the female) is only an Instrumental Efficient: and does
himself, no less then the Female, owe his fecundity, or generative Virtue to
the Sun his Creditour: and therefore the artifice and providence (which we
discover in his workmanship) does not proceed from him, but God. For the Male
uses neither counsel, nor understanding in generation: nor do Men generate by
any part of their reasonable soul, but by a faculty of their vegetative: which
is not inrouled amongst the primary, and more devine powers of the soul, but
the meanest, and basest.

Since therefore in the structure of a chicken, Art and Providence are no less
visible, then in the Fabric of Man himself, and the creation of the Universe:
we must needs acknowledge, that in the generation of Man, there is an Efficient
cause more excellent then man himself: or else that the vegetative faculty, or
that part of the soul, which raises this pile of man, and does conserve it,
is much more divine and excellent, and does more personate the Image of God,
then the Rational part it self: whose worth and dignity we more cry up, then
all the faculties of the soul beside; though she were Regent and Empress of
the rest, and held them all as Tributaries to her. Or at least we must
confess, that there is neither prudence, nor skill, nor understanding in the
works of Nature, but they seem such only to our apprehensions, who judge of
the divine productions of nature, by our own Arts, and Faculties, (or copies
drawn by our own fancies) as if the active principles of Nature did so produce
their effects, as we do our artificial issues: namely by consultation, and
rules desumed from the Mind and Intellect. But Nature, which is the Principle
of Motion and Rest, in all those things wherein she is: and the vegetative
soul, which is the primary Efficient cause of every generation, do move and
act by no acquired faculty (as we do) which may be distinguished by the name
of Art, or Providence, but work by a certain Destiny, and Mandat according to
rule, after the same manner, and constraint, as light things fly up, and heavy
press downwards. The Vegetative faculty of Parents does generate, and the seed
arrives at last at the form of the foetus, after the same manner as the Spider
spreads her Net, the Bees and Ants build their Cottages, and furnish their
storehouses for future exigences, Birds compile their Nests, hatch, and
protect their young: namely, Naturally, and by their Motherwit, not by any
discursive providence, discipline, or consultation. For that which is in us the
Principle of Artificial operations, and is called Art, Understanding, or
Prudence: is in those natural effects, Nature, (which is (...), her own Tutor,
and taught by no man) and what is acquired, and a purchase in us, is in them
inbred, and a Birthright. And therefore they who look back to Art, are
incompetent and partial Judges of natural things: for we are rather to judge of
the contrary, and compare artificial productions to their Sampler in Nature.
For all Arts are attained by an imitation and personating of Nature; and our
Reason, or Intellect is derived from the divine understanding, exercised in its
works. And when it is rooted in us by a complete habit, like another
adventitious acquired soul, reflecting a resemblance of the highest and
divinest Agent, it produces like effects and operations.

Wherefore (in my opinion) he is the right and pious Philosopher, who deduceth
the generations of all things from that eternal and Omnipotent Deity, upon
whose pleasure the Universe depends. Nor do I think we ought to contend, by
what notion we call, or adore this first Agent, (to whom all the names of
veneration are most due) whether that of Deus, or Natura naturans, or Anima
mundi. For all men understand him to be that Beginning and End of all things,
which is Omnipotent, and everlasting, the Author and Creator of all things,
preserving, and perpetuating the fluxibility of mortal creatures, by the
several vicissitudes of generations: which being every where present, is no
less assistant to the particular operations of natural things, then of the
whole Universe; that so he may propagate all Animals by his Deity, Providence,
Art, and divine Understanding. Whereof some are spontaneous births, without any
Univocal efficient; some born by the associat operations of male and female,
some from one Sex only; others by other intermediate Instruments, which
Instruments are sometimes fewer, sometimes more, sometimes univocal, and
sometimes equivocal, and ex accidenti casual.

But all natural bodies whatever are both the productions, and Instruments of
that Great God; and are either only natural, as Heat, Spirit, the tepidity or
warmth of the Air, or Putrefaction, etc. or animate also; for he makes use in
some sort of the motions, faculties, and souls of animals themselves, in order
to the perfection of the Universe, and procreation of Animals.

It appears therefore in some proportion, what the males contribution is
toward generation; namely, the cock brings that same virtue to the egg, by
which of a subventaneous it becomes a fertile one, as vegetable Fruits borrow
from the Summer heat to ripen themselves, and fructify their seeds; and which
induces fertility into spontaneous productions, by which from worms they
become a Canker-worm, and from a Canker-worm, they become the worm called
Aurelia, and from an Aurelia, Butterflies, common Flies, and Bees, etc.

And in this manner the Sun by his access to the earth, is the Beginning of the
motion and transmutation in the Increase of Fruits; and the End also, when he
becomes the author of the fertility of their Seeds. And as in the early Spring
he is the primary efficient of Leaves, Blossoms, and Fruits, so is he the last
compleater of the maturity and fecundity of the Seed in the strength of Summer.
For confirmation of which, amongst many other observations, I shall insert this
one: There are some amongst us who manure their Orange Trees with a great deal
of care and husbandry; so that the Oranges which the first year grew to the
bigness of the top of ones thumb, are the next Summer mature and complete, save
only that they have no kernels, or seeds. While my thoughts were bent upon
this contemplation, I fanfied these Oranges to be a Specimen of the
Subventaneous eggs, which are produced by the Hen, without the Cocks
assistance, having all the sensible appearances or requisites of fruitful eggs,
bating only the fecundity, or propagating seed. As if the same thing were
conferred by the Cock upon a subventaneous egg, to make it fruitful, which the
Sun contributes in hotter climats, whereby the fruit of their trees are
produced with kernels. And as if the English Summer were no farther useful to
some fruit, then the simple Hen to the Egg, and were only like the female, an
impotent progenitress: which Summer in other Countries, where they enjoy a
greater bounty from the Suns presence, were a masculine Summer, and did
complete her productions.

This, by the by, that by the eggs example it might appear, what qualifications
are required to a primary efficient in the generation of Animals. For it is
clear, that there is in an egg an operator (and also in every conception, and
rudiment) which is not only infused into it from the fentale, but is first
communicated from the male by the gemture in coition, but yet first of all
contributed to the Male, from the Heavens, the Sun, or the Almighty Creator. It
is likewise manifest, that this Operator or Agent, which is existent in the
egg, and in every seed, is so inspired with power from the Parents, that it
fashions the chicken to the likeness of the Parents, not of it self; and that a
mixed likeness too, as proceeding from them both united in coition: and since
all things are transacted with an admirable providence and wisdom, the presence
of the divine Deity is clearly employed.

But of this we shall more largely treat elsewhere, when we shall endeavor to
show, what remains in the Female presently after coition, and where it
abides: and likewise (because nothing at all is discoverable in the cavity of
the womb after coition) what that prolifical contagion, or first conception is?
Whether it be any corporeal thing, any where reserved in the female, or
something incorporeal? And whether the conception of the womb be like the
conception of the Brain, and so Fecundity be attained, as Science is? (for
there are arguments not wanting to prove it) and as Motion, and Animal
operations, do take their rise from the conception of the Brain (which we call
the desire, or appetite) so whether do Natural motions likewise, and the
Operations of the Vegetative faculty (especially Generation) depend upon the
conception of the womb? Again, how that prolifical contagion is of a mixed
nature, and transferred from the Male into the Female, and from her into the
Egg? And lastly, how the contagion, or infection of all preternatural
diseases, and distempers do spread, and propagate insensibly.

Of the Order of Generation, and first, of the first Genital Particle.
EXER. LI.
WHat that is which is produced in the Female immediately upon coition, or does
remain in her, which we hitherto do comprise under the name of contagion, by
which, as by Infection, the female is rendered fruitful by the male, and
afterward does generate a foetus of her own accord, shall be said in its
place, where we shall make a stricter disquisition and examination of that
matter. In the mean time, we shall signify to you, all such things as do
openly display themselves in the order of the production of the parts, and are
worth the Observation.

And first of all, because it is plain that the chicken is built by Epigenesis,
or the additament of parts budding one out of another, we will discover what
part is first founded before all its company, and what is observable concerning
it, and the manner of its generation.

That which Aristotle affirms concerning the generation de genesis an. l. 2. c. 1.
of perfect animals, is an undoubted truth, and most apparent in an egg;
namely, that all the parts are not framed together, but one after another in
order; and that the first in being is that genital particle; by virtue of which
afterward (as from their original) all the rest of the parts do arise. As we
see in the seeds of Plants (as Beans and Acorns) a budding, or protuberant
point, which is the foundation of the future Tree.

And this particle is like a Son set free, and dwelling Ibid. c. 1.
in a manor of his own, and a principle subsisting of himself; whence
afterward the order of the parts is delineated, and all things ordered and
regulated which conduce to the complement of the Animal. For since, no part is
its own parent, but when it is once begotten, does provide for it self:
therefore that part must of necessity be first made, which does contain the
principle of increase (for be they Plants or Animals, they have all that in
them which contains a power of vegetation and sustaining;) and distinguishes
also and forms Ib. c. 4.
all the other parts in their due order and rank: therefore the Soul is
primarily in that primogenit particle; which Soul is the fountain and author of
Sense, Motion, and Life of the whole. That therefore is the principal particle,
from which the vital spirit, and native heat do descend into all the rest; in
which the Physicians calidum Innatum sive implantatum, innate or implanted warm
substance, does first display it self; and the domestic houshold-God or
lasting fire inhabits; from whence Life flows into the Body in general, and
each particular part; from whence Nutrition, Aid, Growth, and Comfort derive
their streams: Lastly, where Life first arises to the born, and setts to the
dying creature.

These indeed are all true of the first genital part, and do evidently appear
in the generation of the chicken; and therefore, as I conceive, being moved
thereunto by sundry Observations, the opinion of some Physicians, whose
Philosophy is ill founded, is to be rejected (whereby they decree that the
three principal and eldest parts, the Brain, the Heart, and the Liver, do
together spring out of the small bladders or bubbles) so neither can I assent
to Aristotle himself, who concludes that the Heart is this first genital and
animate particle. For the truth is, I am persuaded that this Prerogative is
only due to the Blood: for the blood is it which is first seen in Generation.
And that not only in an Egg, but in every Foetus, and animal conception
whatsoever: As shall plainly appear anon.

There appears, I say, from the beginning, Punctum Rubrum saliens, Vesicula
pulsans, Fibraeque inde deductae, the Red capering Point, the Panting Vesicle,
and the Fibers deduced thence, which contain blood. And so far as I could
possibly discern by accurate Inspection, the Blood is formed before the Punctum
saliens, and is endowed with vital heat, before it moves by pulse; and in it,
and from it does the pulsation begin. For I have found it true by sundry
experiments both in an egg, and elsewhere, that the blood is it, in which (so
long as the vital heat is not quite extinct) resideth the possibility of
reviving.

And since the Vesicula pulsans, and the Fibers containing blood which are
derived from it, are seen before any other parts; I conceive it consonant to
reason, that the blood is made before his receptacles; that is to say, the
thing contained, before the thing containing; for the latter is made to be
serviceable to the former. And therefore it is most probable, That the Veins,
and Fibers, and then the Vesicle, and after it the Heart, as being Instruments
destined to receive and house the blood, are erected for the transmission, and
distribution of it, and that the blood is the primary particle of the body.

And this is manifest by many Observations; but chiefly, in that some living
creatures (and such too as have blood) live a good while without any pulse at
all; and some become like Anchorites all the Winter long, and yet survive,
though their Hearts within them do respite all their motions, and their Lungs
make Holy Day, and forbear respiration; like those persons, who in a Syncope,
Lipothymia, or Hysterical passions, lie half-dead without the motion of the
Pulse.

Being therefore ascertained out of those things which I have observed in an
Egg, and the dissection of Animals while they were alive, I conclude (against
Aristotle) that the blood is the first Genital particle, and that the Heart is
its Instrument designed for its Circulation. For the Hearts business or
function is the propulsation or driving forth of the blood, as appears in all
Animals that have blood: and the office of the Vesicula pulsans is the very
same, (in the generation of the Chicken) which I have showed to many persons,
in the first conceptions of Animals, (as well as in an Egg) when it has been
less then a Spark, panting, and in its motion, drawing it self together, and so
squeezing out the blood contained in it, and by relaxing it self again,
receiving and entertaining blood afresh.

And hence the prerogative and antiquity of the blood appears, seeing that the
Pulse proceeds from it. For there being two parts of Pulsation; (Distention,
and Contraction, or Systole, and Diastole) and the first of these motions is
Distention, it is manifest that that action proceeds from the blood; but the
Contraction is made by the Vesicula pulsans in an Egg, (as by the Heart in a
Chicken) by its proper fibers; as by an Organ destined to that use. And it is
also certain, that the said Vesicula, as also the Auricula cordis, the
deaf-eare of the Heart, afterward (from whom the Pulsation first begins) are
incited to the constrictive motion, by the blood distending them. The Diastole,
or Dilatation, is made by the blood boiling or swelling by the spirits within
it: And so Aristotle's Opinion concerning the pulsation of the Heart, (namely,
that it is made by a kind of Ebullition) is in some sort true. For as in Milk
set upon the fire, and in Beer, we see daily a Fermentation, working, or
Intumescence; so is it in the pulse of the Heart, in which the blood, as by a
kind of fermentation working up, is distended, and then ebbs, or falls down
again: and that which befalls them per accidens, from an external agent
(namely, an adventitious heat) that is accomplished in the blood, by its own
internal heat, or innate spirit; and is also regulated by the soul in a natural
way, and for the preservation of living creatures.

The Pulse therefore is performed by a twofold Agent; namely, the Distention or
Dilatation proceeds from the Blood; and the Constriction, from the membrane of
the vesicula in the Egg; (but in the Foetus when it is born, from the
Deaf-eares, and Ventricles of the Heart) and by the mutual performance of this
alternate and interchanging motion, the blood is driven round the whole body,
and so our lives continued.

Nor is the Blood therefore only to be called the Primigenial and principal
part, because that in, and from it the fountain of motion and pulsation is
derived; but also, because the Animal heat, or vital spirit is first radicated
and implanted, and the soul takes up her first mansion in it. For wheresoever
the immediate and principal Instrument of the vegetative faculty is first
found, there in probability the soul first resides, and takes her Beginning; as
being inseparable from the spirit, and the calidum innatum.

For however in Artificial Operations (as Fabricius rightly admonishes) the
Artificer and the Instruments page 28.
are separated; yet in the works of Nature they are conjoined, and one and the
same: so the Stomach is both the Author, and the Instrument of chylification.
So in like manner, the Soul with the Spirit (her Instrument) is immediately
conjoined: and therefore be it in what part it will, that heat and motion first
begin, there also the Life does first arise, and last expire; and out of
question, the most intimate domestic Deities, and Soul it self, are there
enshrined.

Life therefore consists in the blood, (as we read in Holy Scripture) because
in it the Life and Soul Levit. 17. 11. and 14.
do first dawn, and last set. For I have experimented in the dissection of many
live Animals, that when the body was now a dying, and breathing done, the Heart
continued its pulse a while, and kept up life in it. And when the Heart has
now given over, you shall discern a motion yet surviving in the Auriculae, or
Deaf-eares; and though the other fail, yet the Right will still be stirring;
and when that submits to Fate too, yet you shall perceive a kind of
undulation, or waving to and fro, and obscure trepidation, or palpitation in
the champion -blood, proclaiming that he gave the last blow. And any man may
plainly see, that the blood retains heat, (that deriver of Life and Palsation)
when all the other parts are chilled, and cold: which heat when it is quite
extinct, as the blood is then no longer sanguis, sed cruor, Blood, but Gore; so
now no longer hope of returning back to lise. But, both in an Egg, and in
gasping Animals, after all pulsation is expunged, if you apply a gentle warmth
either to the Punctum saliens, or the right Auricle of the Heart, you shall
presently see the motion, pulsation, and life set on foot again by the Blood;
except he have quite fore-gone all his innate heat, and vital spirit.

By all which it is most evident, that the blood is the Genital Part, the
fountain of Life, Primum vivens, and ultimum moriens, the Firstborn, and the
Longest Liver, and the chief Palace and Court of the soul: in which (as in its
Springhead) the heat does first and chiefly flow, and flourish: and from which
all the other parts of the Body derive their life and influent warmth. For that
heat streaming with the blood, does sprinckle, cherish, and preserve the whole:
as we have heretofore demonstrated in our Book, de Motu sanguinis.

And therefore Blood is found in every particle of the Body, nor can you find
footing for the point of a needle, or the edge of your nail, where you shall
not immediately start the blood: as if, were it not for the blood, the body
would enjoy no heat, nor life. Therefore the blood being never so little
concentrated and fixed, (Hippocrates calls it, (...)) as it is in Swouning,
frights, extreme cold weather, and the approach of the Paroxysme or fit of an
Ague, you shall presently behold, the whole body freeze, and grow stiff, and
languish in a pale and livid complexion: but the blood being summoned back, by
applied Fomentations, exercise, or affections of the Mind, (as Joy, or Anger)
how nimbly do all parts recover their Heat, Floridnesse, Vigor and Beauty.

And hereupon the ruddy sanguine parts alone, are called the Hot parts, as the
Flesh; but the white and bloodless parts, as the Nerves and Ligaments, the
Cold. And as Sanguineous Animals exceed the bloodless; so even in the parts,
those that are more liberally endowed with Blood, are counted the Eminent
parts. And the Liver, Spleen, Reins, Lungs, and Heart it self (if you strain
all the blood out of them, for whose sake they are chiefly called Viscera) they
presently grow pale, and wan, and are to be registered amongst the colder parts.

The Heart himself, I say, does by the Coronary Arteries receive the Blood,
its influent heat and life, both which it enjoyes upon no other account, then
the mere bounty of the Blood. Nor can the Liver proceed in its public office,
without the influence of blood and heat from the Coeliacal Artery. For there is
no where any affluence of heat, without an Influence or influx of blood by the
Arteries. And therefore in the first Confirmation of all the parts, before they
put themselves into public undertakings, they are to be discovered pale, and
blood-lesse: hereupon the old Physicians and Anatomists supposed them to be
spermatical parts, and this speech was wont to obtain amongst them, that in
Generation, Aliquot in Lacte dies absumuntur, some days are spent in the Milk,
that is about the Constitution of the white; Spermatical parts. The very
substance of the Liver it self, the Lungs, and the Heart, at their first
appearance are exceeding white. Nay the Cone of the Heart, and the walls or
sides of its Ventricles, are even then white, when the Auriculae are full, and
dyed with Scarlet-blood, and the Coronary Vein looks ruddy. So likewise the
Parenchyma of the Liver is it self white, when the branches and propagations
of its Veins are blushing with blood: nor does it execute its public office,
until it be thoroughly drenched with blood.

And lastly, the blood does so surround, and pierce into the whole body, and
impart heat and life to all its parts, that the soul may justly be counted
resident in it, and for his sake, Tota in tota and tota in qualibet part, to
be all in all, and all in every part, (as the old saying is.)

But it is so far from truth (which yet Aristotle and all Physicians affirm)
that the Liver, or Heart is the Author of the Blood: that the contrary, out of
the fabric of the chicken in the egg, is most manifest: namely, the Blood
rather is the Author of the Heart, and Liver. And this also Physicians before
they are aware seem to acknowledge, while they conclude that the Parenchyma of
the Liver is a certain affusion, or conflux of Blood: as if it were nothing
else but blood congealed. Now it must have a being before it can be affused, or
coagulated: and that it is so, experience her self openly displayes; for blood
appears in the egg, before there be any track or Rudiment of any such thing as
the Body, or any of the Viscera. And yet no blood can come thither from the
Mother to the Fatus, (as people commonly fancy in Viviparous productions.)

The Liver of Fishes is always whitish, though their Veins are purpled, and
dark. And our Hens the better they are crammed, so much the more do their
Livers impair, and grow pallid. Greensickness Virgins that are Cachectical, as
the habit of their bodies is pale, so is their Liver: an evident sign of the
penury and dearth of Blood. Therefore the Liver borrows his heat and complexion
from the blood, and not the blood from him.

Hence it is plain, that blood is the prime genital Part, whence the soul
primarily results, and out of which the primary animate part of the Foetus,
which is the fountain of all the rest, both similar, and dissimilar is derived,
which by that means attain their Vital heat, and become subservient to it: And
the Heart is erected for this end and purpose only, that it may by continual
pulsation (to which the Veins and Arteries are ministerial and subservient)
entertain this blood, and spout it out again up and down through the whole body.

All which is the clearer discovered by this, that the Heart has not a
pulsation in all Animals, nor yet at all times; when yet the blood, or
something proportionable to blood is never wanting in any.

Of the Blood, as it is the Principal Part.
EXER. LII.
IT is therefore evident, even to the Eye, that the blood is the Primigenial,
and so the Genital part: and that all those attributes recited in the precedent
Chapter are consistent with it: namely, that it is the builder and preserver of
the body and principal part wherein the soul has her Session. For (as we newly
said) before any particle of the body appear, the blood is born, and grows,
having a palpitation (as Aristotle says) within the Veins moving De hist. an.
l. 3. c. 19.
to and fro with a Pulse, and is above all the humors dispersed through the
whole body. And so long as life does last, the Blood alone is Animate, and hot.

Moreover, by his various motions, in celerity, or slowness; vehemence, or
feebleness, etc. He plainly discovers his resentment of the affronts which any
thing casts upon him, and the friendships of such as cherish him. We therefore
conclude, the blood lives and is nourished of it self, no way depending upon
any other part of the body, as elder or worthier then it self. But whether the
whole body depend upon it, as being postgenit, adjoined, and a kind of appendix
or retainer to it, is not the business of this place. I shall only add, what
Aristotle confesses, Truly the nature of the blood De part. an. l. 2. c. 4.
is the cause, why very many things befall Animals, both in order to their
manners and sense. So that hence we may perceive the Causes not of life only
in general, (for you can never discover any other Calidum innatum aut influens,
innate or influent heat which may be the immediate instrument of the soul,
besides the Blood) but also of longer or shorter life, or sleep, and
wakefulness, of Wit and Strength etc. For by its tenuity (says Aristotle in
the same place) and cleanness or purity, creatures are wiser, and have quicker
senses: and likewise are either more timorous, or courageous, angry and
furious: according as their blood is more dilute and thin, or more compact and
gross by fibers.

Nor is blood the Author of life only, but according to its several
discriminations, it is the cause of health, or diseases. And Poisons
themselves, which assault us from without, (as poisoned darts or bullets) did
they not infect the blood, would do us no prejudice. So that our life, and
welfare is derived unto us from the same spring. If the Hist. an. l. 3. c. 9.
blood be over liquid, says Aristotle, men grow sick; for it degenerates into
so serous a gore, that some have swet Blood. If too much of it stream out, they
die. For by want of blood, all the parts do not only languish presently, but
the Animal it self soon expires. I conceive it inconvenient to set down
Experiments to confirm this, because they require a peculiar Tract. I perceive
that the wonderful Circulation of the blood, first found out by me, is
consented to almost by all: and that no man has hitherto made any objection to
it, greatly worth a confutation: Wherefore if I shall subjoine the causes, and
benefits of that Circulation, and lay open some other secrets of the blood, as,
how much it conduces to the happiness of the creature, as also to both soul,
and body, that so men may be cautious to preserve their blood pure and clean,
by commodious diet, I conceive I shall perform an office, not more new, then
useful, and acceptable to Philosophers, and Physicians: nor will this opinion
seem so improbable and absurd to any, as once to Aristotle; namely, That the
Blood, like a Tutelar De Anima. l. 1. c. 2.
Deity, is the very soul in the body, as Critias of old, and others thought,
supposing sense to be the chiefest property of the soul, and that sense to be
in her by the nature of the Blood. Now some concluded it to be the soul,
because it has a power of moving by its own nature: As Thales, Diogenes,
Heraclitus, Alcmaeon, and others.

But that both sense and motion are in the Blood, De hist. an. l. 1. c. 19. and
de part. an. l. 2. c. 3.
is conspicuous by many tokens, though Aristotle denied it. For if he himself
compelled by the truth of the thing it self, did confess, that there was a soul
in an egg, though the egg were addle: and that in the Geniture and Blood was
found a divine substance, proportionably answering to the Matter of the Stars,
and that it was the Creators Viceroy: If some of the Moderns say, that the
seed of Animals ejected in Coition is animate, Why should we not upon as good
reason say, that there is a soul in the Blood? and seeing it is the first
begotten, first moved, and first nourished, why should we doubt to affirm, that
the soul is first raised, and kindled out of it? Blood is that, wherein the
Vegetal and sensative operations first shine forth: in which the primary and
immediate officer of the soul, is bred; which is the common tie of soul and
body; and in which, as in her Chariot, the soul visits and scatters influence
upon all the parts of the body.

Besides, since the contemplation of Geniture is (as we have seen already) so
difficult, (namely, how the fabric of the body should be built by it, with
providence, art, and divine understanding) why should we not by the same right,
admire the excellent nature of blood, and harbor as worthy thoughts concerning
it, as seed? especially seeing the Geniture it self (as appears by the egg) is
made of the blood; and all the whole body (as from its Genital part) seems not
only to desume its first Foundation, but Preservation also, from it.

Thus much by the way concerning this matter, being to treat more fully and
exactly of it elsewhere. Nor do I conceive it worth the trouble, to dispute
here, whether the definition of a part in its proper acceptance agree to
blood? which some deny upon these grounds chiefly, because it has not sense,
and because it flows and insinuates into all the parts of the body, to cater
convenient diet for them. But I have found many things about the manner of
Generation, by which being convinced, I shall establish the contrary to those
things, (which Philosophers and Physicians commonly affirm, or deny.) At
present I will only say, that in case we should consent that the blood has
not sense, yet it cannot be thence inferred, that it is no part of the
sensitive body, and that the chifest too. For neither the Brain, nor the
Spinal Marrow, or the Crystalline, or Glassie humor of the Eye have any sense,
and yet all Philosophers and Physicians do to this day with one consent, allow
them to be parts of the body. But Aristotle did number it amongst the similar
parts, and Hippocrates also; for while he constitutes the Animal body, out of
containing, and contained parts, and impetum facientibus, spirits, he did
necessarily own the blood amongst the contained parts.

But of this more at large, when we enquire what a part is, and how many
several acceptations there are of it. In the mean time, we will not conceal
this Admirable Experiment (by which it shall appear that the most principal
member of all, namely, the very Heart it self, may seem to be insensible.)

A Noble young Gentleman, Son and Heir to the honorable the Vice-Count of
Mountgomery in Ireland, when he was a child, had a strange mishapp by an
unexpected fall, causing a Fracture in the Ribs on the left side: the Bruise
was brought to a Suppuration, whereby a great quantity of putrified matter was
voided out, and this putrefaction gushed out for a long while together out of
the wide wound. I deliver it from his own mouth, and the testimony of other
creditable persons, who were eyewitnesses. This person of Honor, about the
eighteenth, or nineteenth year of his Age, having been a Traveller in Italy and
France, arrived at last at London: having all this time a very wide gap open in
his Breast, so that you might see and touch his Lungs (as it was believed.)
Which, when it came to the late King Charles his ear, being related as a
miracle, He presently sent me to the Young Gentleman, to inform Him, how the
matter stood. Well, what happened? When I came near him, and saw him a
sprightly Youth, with a good complexion, and habit of body, I supposed, some
body or other had framed an untruth. But having saluted him, as the manner is,
and declared unto him the Cause of my Visit, by the Kings Command, he
discovered all to me, and opened the void part of his left side, taking off
that small plate, which he wore to defend it against any blow or outward
injury. Where I presently beheld a vast hole in his breast, into which I could
easily put my three Fore-fingers, and my Thumb; and at the first entrance I
perceived a certain fleshy part sticking out, which was driven in and out by a
reciprocal motion, whereupon I gently handled it in my hand. Being now amazed
at the novelty of the thing, I search it again and again, and having diligently
enough enquired into all, it was evident, that that old and vast Ulcer (for
want of the help of a skillful Physician) was miraculously healed, and skinned
over with a membrane on the Inside, and guarded with flesh all about the
brimmes or margent of it. But that fleshy substance (which at the first sight I
conceived to be proud flesh, and every body else took to be a lobe of the
Lungs) by its pulse, and the differences or rythme thereof, or the time which
it kept, (and laying one hand upon his wrest, and the other upon his heart) and
also by comparing and considering his Respirations, I concluded it to be no
part of the Lungs, but the Cone or Substance of the Heart; which an excrescent
fungous Substance (as is usual in soul Ulcers) had fenced outwardly like a
Sconce. The Young Gentleman's Man did by daily warm injections deliver that
fleshy accretion from the filth and pollutions which grew about it, and so
clapped on the Plate: which was no sooner done, but his Master was well, and
ready for any journey or exercise, living a pleasant, and secure life.

Therefore, instead of an Account of the Business, I brought the Young
Gentleman himself to our late King, that he might see, and handle this strange
and singular Accident with his own Senses; namely, the Heart and its Ventricles
in their own pulsation, in a young, and sprigtly Gentleman, without offense to
him: Whereupon the King himself consented with me, That the Heart is deprived
of the Sense of Feeling. For the Party perceived not that we touched him at
all, but merely by seeing us, or by the sensation of the outward skin. We
likewise took notice of the motion of his Heart; namely, that in the Diastole
it was drawn in and retracted, and in the Systole came forth, and was thrust
out; and that the Systole was made in the heart, when the Diastole was sensible
in the wrest; and also that the proper motion of the heart is the Systole; and
lastly, that the heart then beats upon the breast, and is a little prominent,
when it is lifted upwards and contracted into it self.

Nor is that other Controversy (namely, whether the Blood do only serve to
nourish the Body) to be much insisted upon in this place. Aristotle indeed does
in several places contend, that the blood is Alimentum ultimum, the last
Aliment, and with him the whole School of Physicians give suffrage. And yet
many things hard to be unfolded, and of bad coherence, will ensue upon that
opinion. For, when Physicians treat of the Blood in

(...) stotle, did constitute the blood out of parts and differences in some
manner alike. Physicians indeed do only take notice of humane blood, and of
that as it spins into a Sawcer in Phlebotomy, and so coagulates. Aristotle
contemplates the blood of all creatures in general, or that which bears an
Analogy with blood. But laying aside all cavil, and omitting the inconveniences
which do pursue their opinion, I shall briefly touch upon those things, which
they both consent in, and are plainly discovered by sense it self, and are more
pertinent to our business: intending elsewhere to examine them at large.

Though (as I have informed you) the blood is called a part of the body, and
that the primigenial and principal part; yet if it be considered in the whole
lump (as it is in the Veins) nothing hinders, why we may not say, that it
conteins Aliment, concocts it, and does apply it to all parts: and that being
one and the same thing, yet in that acceptance it may be said, both to feed,
and to be fed, as also to be both the material and efficient cause of the Body:
and naturally to have that very constitution, which Aristotle conceived to be
necessary in the primigenial part; namely, that the blood is partly of a
similar, and partly of a dissimilar constitution. For, says he, Since for
senses sake it is necessarily ordered, that there should be similar members in
Animals; and since both the power of sensation, motion, and nutrition, are all
comprehended in the same member, (namely the Primogenit) it is necessary that
that member (which conteins such principles in it) should both be simple, that
it may be capable of all sensible objects; and also dissimilar, that it may
move, and act. Wherefore, he goes on, in the race of creatures that have blood,
the Heart is counted such a member: but in the bloodless, that member which is
proportionable to the Heart.

Now if by the Heart he understand that particle which is first seen in the
Egg; namely, the Blood, together with its receptacles (the Vesiculae
pulsantes, and the Veins) as one and the same Organ; I then conceive he speaks
most true: for the Blood as it is discovered in the Egg and the Vesicula, is
partly similar, and partly dissimilar. But if he understand it otherwise, that
which is seen in the egg, will easily confute him: for the substance of the
Heart, being considered without the Blood (namely, its Cones, and the Walls or
partitions of its Ventricles) is generated long after: and continues so long
white, without any irrigation of blood upon it, until the Heart be fashioned
into an Organical form, such as may spout the blood through the whole body. Nor
does the Heart, then, appear of a similar or simple constitution (as is fit for
a Primogenit part to do) but fibrous, fleshey, and musculous: and indeed (as
Hippocrates would have it) a plain Muscle, or Instrument of motion. But, the
blood, (as it is first seen, and as it beats being yet comprehended in the
Vesicula,) is plainly of that constitution, which Aristotle judges necessary
to a Principal part. For the blood, while it is in its natural constitution in
the body, is altogether similar. But so soon as it is dislodged, and out of its
receptacles, and puts of its native heat; it presently degenerates into several
parts, as some dissimilar thing.

But if the blood were naturally designed only to the nourishing of the body,
it would be only of a similar constitution; like the Chyle, or White of an
egg; or at least it would be a mixed body, being compounded of the foresaid
parts or juyces, and yet truly one: as those other juyces; namely, the Choler
and Phlegm, which after death, even when they are taken out of their
habitations, remain the same, as when they were seen in the live body: but are
not so soon changed.

Wherefore, what Aristotle attributes to a Principal part, that very same thing
is proper to blood. For blood, as it is a Natural body, being an Heterogeneous,
or Dissimilar substance, is compounded of those parts, or juyces. But as it
lives, and it the chief Animal part, compounded of a body and soul. But when
that soul, by reason of the expiration of the native heat, does vanish, and its
native substance is presently corrupted, and is dissolved into those parts, of
which it was formerly made: namely, first into a Watery Blood, next into Red,
and White parts: and the Red parts, which are uppermost, are most florid: but
those that sinck downwards grow dark, and black. Now some of the parts also are
fibrous, and thicker, as being the tie, and connection of the rest; others are
ichorous and serous, upon which the coagulated lump uses to float. And into
this Serum almost all the blood degenerates. Now these parts are not in the
live blood, but only when it is now corrupted and dissolved by death.

Besides the recited parts, there is seen in hotter and stronger Animals, as in
Horses, Oxen, and Men also of a more lively constitution, another part of
blood, which when the blood is let out and grumefieth, seating it self in the
upper part of the redder blood, does condense, and plainly resemble a Gelly
made of Hartshorn, or kind of Mucilage, or thicker white of an egg. The
vulgar count it the Phlegm, and Aristotle the crude and unconcocted part of
the blood.

I have observed this part, to differ, as well, from the serous, (upon which
the coagulated gore uses to swim) as from the other parts, as likewise from
the Urine, which is dreined by the Kidneys from the blood. Nor is it to be
thought the cruder and colder part of the blood, but the more spirital, as I
suppose, and that by two experiments; First, because it swimmes above the
florid and brighter part of the blood, (which is vulgarly conceived to be the
Arterial blood) as being hotter, and fuller of spirits then it, and upon the
disgregation of the blood, obtaines the upper place.

Also in breathing a Vein, this sort of blood (where of there is plenty in
persons of a hot temperature, that are strong and fleshy) it darts it self out
in a longer stream, and more vehemence (as if it spirted out of a Syringe) and
hereupon we count it hotter, and more spirital: as that geniture is counted
most fertile and fraught with spirits, which leaps farthest and most forcibly.

And that this gelly does much differ from that ichorous and watery substance,
which (as being colder then the rest) sinketh down to the bottom of the sawcer,
is evident for two reasons: for the watery and washy part is more crude and
inconcocted, then that it may be wrought up into perfect blood. But the gelly,
which is thicker and more fibrous, swimming above the lump of blood, appears
more concocted and elaborate then it. And therefore in the solution or
partition of the blood, this gelly keeps aloof, the whey or sanies lowest, but
the lump and red parts (as well the brighter as the darker) possess the middle
region.

Now is it most certain, that not only that part, but all the blood, nay the
very flesh it self (as may be observed in Bodies hanged in Chains) may may be
corrupted into ichorous whey. As being resolved into that substance, of which
they were first compounded: so Salt is resolved into Lie, from whence it first
sprung. So likewise in every Cachexie, the blood that is let, abounds with
plenty of Serum: so that sometimes there scarce appears any grumous part at
all, but all the blood seems to be one entire washy gore; as we find in that
kind of Dropsy called Anasarca: and it is also natural in creatures that are
bloodless.

Likewise, if you breath a vein immediately after you have eat and drank,
(before the second concoction be finished, and the Serum descended through the
Kidneys) or upon the first approach of a fit of an Ague, you shall find the
blood to be washy, inconcocted, and mingled with much whey. But on the
contrary, if upon an empty Stomach, or discharge of the Urine, or a large
Sweat, you open a Vein, you shall find the blood thick (as being quite
destitute of Serum) and being almost all condensed into a lump.

And as when the blood grows raw and crude, you shall perceive but very little
of this gelly floating a top. So if you pour out the Serum separated from the
lump or mass, and let it simper upon a gentle fire, you shall soon see it
changed into this gelly: which is a manifest sign, that that washy or serous
substance, which is now divided from the rest of the blood, is perhaps some
matter of the Urine, but not the Urine it self, though in color and
consistence it look like it. For the Urine being boiled, is not thickened into a
fibrous Gelly, but rather into a Lie: but this washy or serous part being a
while gently heated, condenseth into a gelly like that above: as on the
contrary, that ^u^ago, or gelly, degenerating into more crudity by corruption,
is dissolved into Serum.

And thus far have I brought this part of the blood (which is my own
Observation) upon the Stage; of which (and the other parts of blood, which are
apparent to sense, and allowed by the authority of Aristotle, and Physicians) I
shall more copiously discourse hereafter.

In this place, not to digress farther, I conceive the blood to be taken (with
Aristotle) not as it is De genesis an. l. 2. c. 3.
simply understood, and called Cruor, but as it is a living part of an Animal
body. For so Aristotle: The blood is hot in such a sense, as if we could call
hot water by one only word, and not as a subject receiving heat into it. For
heat is in the essence of the blood; as whiteness, in a white man. But when
blood is made hot by any distemper, or passion of the Mind, it is not then
calidus perse, hot, by its own heat. And thus we may say of that which is
moist, or dry. Wherefore, partly a hot, and partly a moist substance is in the
nature of such kind of things; but if you divide them, they then grow cold,
and congeale; and such is blood.

Blood therefore as it is a living part of the Body, is of a doubtful nature,
and falls under a two fold consideration. And therefore materialiter and per
se, it is called nutriment; but formaliter, as it is endued with heat, and
spirits, (which are the immediate instruments of the Soul) and with the Soul it
self: it is to be counted the Bodies Genius, and Conserver, the Principal,
Primogenit, and Genital part. And as a Prolifical egg is the Matter,
Instrument, and Efficient cause of the Chicken, and as all Physicians count the
geniture of both Sexes mingled in the womb after coition, both for the material
and efficient of the Foetus; so, upon a better right, may we affirm, That the
Blood is both the Matter and Preserver of the Body, and not the bare Aliment.
For it is a known thing in Creatures that are starved by hunger, and Men also
that dye of Consumptions, that a great quantity of blood remains in their Veins
even after death. And also Young men that are in their growth, and Old men that
are declining, have a proportionable quantity of blood; namely, according to
the increase, or diminution of their Flesh. So that the blood is a part, and
not the nutriment only of the Body. For if that were the only use of it, no
man would be starved, so long as any drop of the blood remains in the veins, as
the flame of a Lamp does not expire, so long as any oil at all remains to
support it.

But while I affirm the soul to reside first, and principally in the blood, I
would not have any man hastily to conclude from hence, that all Blood-letting
is dangerous, or hurtful; or believe with the Vulgar, that as much of blood,
so much of life is taken away, because Holy-writ places the life in the blood.
For daily experience shows, that Letting blood is a safe cure for several
Diseases, and the chiefest of Universal Remedies: because the default, or
superfluity of the blood is the seminary of most distempers; and a seasonable
evacuation of it, does often rescue men from most desperate maladies, and Death
it self. For look how much blood is according to Art taken away, so many years
are added to the Age.

Nature her self was our Tutor here, whom Physicians transcribe: for She, of
her own accord, does many times vanquish the most mortal Infirmities by a
plentiful and critical evacuation, either at the Nose, Haemorrhoids, or by
menstruous Purgations. And therefore young people, who feed high, and live
idly, unless about the eighteenth or twentieth year of their age (at which
time the stock of blood increases, together with the bulk of their bodies) they
be disburdened of the load and oppression of their blood, either by a
spontaneous release at the Nose, or Inferior parts, or by breathing a Vein,
they are dangerously set upon by Fevers, Smallpox, Headaches, and other more
grievous Distempers and Symptoms. Alluding to which, the Farriers, do begin
almost all Cures of Beasts with Letting blood.

What Observations are to be collected from the Ramifications of the Umbilical
veins in the Egg.
EXERCIT. LIII.
WE see the Blood is made in the Egg and Conception before any thing else; and
near upon that time, do its Receptacles, that is, the Veins, and Vesicula
pulsans appear. And therefore if we admit the Punctum saliens, together with
the blood and veins, as one and the same Organical part, visible in the first
dawning of the Foetus, to stand for the Heart (whose Parenchyma does
afterward, in the formation of the Foetus, grow to the Vesicula;) it is clear
then, that the Heart under this acceptance (namely, as an Organ compounded of
a Parenchyma, Ventricles, Deaf-ears, Vessels, and Blood) is truly (according to
Aristotle's own mind) the principal and primary part of the body: and yet its
first and chief part is blood; and that not only in order of Nature, but of
Generation too.

The parts next in Generation to the blood, are the Veins: for the blood must
needs be kept in vessels. And therefore (as Aristotle observed) there are found
two venal Channels near upon the very beginnings of all, which do afterward
(as we have taught in our History) constitute the Umbilical vessels.

From their Situation therefore and Ramification, some things come to be
observed. The First is, that all the Veins and Arteries arise from the heart;
for they are as so many retainers belonging to the Heart, or as certain parts
of it. If therefore you diligently observe a (humane or any other) foetus new
born, and cutting in sunder the Vena Cava between the right Auricle of the
Heart, and the Diaphragma, if you mark it as it looks downwards, you shall
discover three Holes, whereof the greatest and hinde-most tending toward the
Spine of the back, is the Hole of the descending Vena Cava; the fore-most, and
lesser, is carried into the Root and Trunk of the Umbilical vessels; the third,
and the lest of all, passes into the Liver, and is the Fountain and Trunk of
all the branches disseminated into the Gibbous part of the Liver. By which it
is evident, that the veins do not (as some would have it) proceed from the
Liver, as from their Original, but from the Heart: unless they will obstinately
affirm, that the Trunk and body of a vein arises from some little branch of the
vein, and not the branches from the Trunk.

Moreover, since the foresaid vessels in the Egg, are alike disseminated into
the Yolk and White (after the manner as Plants work in their Roots into the
Ground) it appears, that both their liquours are the nutriment of the Foetus,
and that that nourishment is by these Vessels conveyed unto it: and that
against Aristotle, who every where affirms, that the Chicken assumes
nourishment by the Navel, De hist. an. l. 2. c. 3. De genesis an. l. 3. c. 1. and
3.
only from the Yolk, but is made of the White. The White indeed is first
spent, and the Yolke, though late, does yet at last become the Nutriment, and
supplies the place of Milk when the Chicken is now hatched: to the intent, that
Nature might afford to Oviparous creatures such an aliment as she holds out to
Viviparous by the Breasts, or Udder. Hereupon it falls out, that when all the
White is exhausted, the Yolk continues almost entire, even when the Chicken is
consummate, and complete; nay, even after his Exclusion.

Aristotle, indeed, ten days after the Chickens exclusion, found some
remainder of the Yolk in the Chicken: but I have observed even after six weeks
time, some part of it fastened to the Guts in the Chickens belly.

Yet upon the reception of the Yolk into the Abdomen of the Chicken, (which
while the Foetus is forming, and growing, does not abate so much as the White,
but continues almost entire, when both the Whites are now quite wasted) and
also upon the Observation at the Distribution of the Veins through the
substance of the Yolk: all which being collected into one Trunk, do pass into
the Vena Porta, and do carry part of the Yolk thither, to receive a further
concoction in the Liver; upon these, I say, and such like grounds, I cannot but
acknowledge with Aristotle, that the Yolk does nourish the Chicken, and has
some analogy to Milk.

The Yolk does not remain entire after the Consummation of the Foetus, for a
portion of it is dissolved in the first conformation of the Chicken; and it
likewise does admit the propagations of the Veins (as well as the White) by
which after it is now prepared, it becomes the Nutriment of the Foetus: yet
certain it is, that the greatest part of it does survive the wasted white, and
that surviving part is entertained into the belly of the Chicken; and being
attracted by the small branches of the Vena Porta, is at last conveyed into the
Liver.

It is therefore a clear case, that the Chicken newly hatched, (while it is yet
weak and tender) is nourished by the yolk. And as while he remained within the
Egg, he was partly fed by the yolke, and partly by the whites, but chiefly by
the hospitality of the whites, which as they are in greater quantity, so are
they sooner exhausted: so in like manner, when he is now hatched, (at which
time all his aliment passes through his Liver, and there receives a farther
preparation) he is nourished partly by the yolk attracted from the Guts, and
partly by the Chyle, which the several propagations of the Meseraick Veins
suck into themselves; when there is in the yolk only one propagation of the
Vena Porta distributed into it, and a little only of the yolk remaining. For
Nature, as Nurses, being about to wean their Infants by degrees, gives them
other meats sometimes, that so they may the better endure the decay of the
milk: so the Chicken is trained by degrees, from meat of easier concoction, to
harder (as from the Yolk, to the Chyle.)

Therefore what we see of the propagation of the Veins in the Egg, is done
upon exceeding good grounds. For as soon as the Chicken begins first to be
modelled, the Veins are then extended only into the Colliquamentum; by which
the blood being fed and grown, adjoyns the rest of the body to himself, to be
brought up with him. Afterward, the veins reach into the thinner white, from
whence the Chicken receives his sustenance, (while he yet resembles a Gelly,
or Mucilage, and a Maggot) afterward they spread into the thicker White, and
anon into the Yolk, that by that also it may be entertained; and being as yet
but tender, it is fed in part by the yolk (as by milk) hoarded up in the
abdomen, and in part by food provided and prepared by the Hen, till it be able
to seek abroad for nourishment convenient, and can digest it. So that through
the whole series of Generation, Nature has most prudently considered of
various Aliment proportionable to the various abilities of the Digestive
faculty of the future Foetus. For while it is yet feeble, she has provided it
milder diet, and solider meats for its stronger capacity: and when it is now
hearty enough, and can away with courser cates, it is served with commons
answerable to it. And hereupon I conceive, that perfect eggs are not only
party-colored, but also furnished with a double White.

And what we have found out by Experience, De genesis an. l. 3. c. 1.
seems also to agree with Aristotle's opinion, where he says, That Part of it
which is hotter, comes nearer the form designed to the institution of the
members, but that which is earthier, yields matter to frame the body, and is
more unlike. As in party-colored eggs, the animal assumes the Rudiments of its
generation from the White, (for the animals beginning is in the hot part) and
its aliment from the yolk. Therefore in hotter animals, those two are reserved
apart; namely, that from whence they take the beginning of their being, and
that from whence they derive their aliment, and one of them is white, and the
other yellow.

It appears by what has been said, that the Chicken (and the same thing shall
afterward be demonstrated of all conceptions) as he results, or is framed from
the implanted principle, or soul of the egg, so he also obtaines his
nourishment from the Egg too: wherefore he has no need of a mother, as the
Plants have of the Earth.

And it is no truer of him, that he is nourished by his mothers blood, or lives
by her spirits; and so his own heart lies fallow and idle the while, then that
he moves and perceives by his mothers organs, or is enlivened and takes growth
from her soul. But the case is plain, and all men acknowledge, that the Foetus
is fed by the Umbilical Vessels; and that the Venal branches disseminated into
the White and Yolk, do hence derive sustenance, which they impart to the Foetus.

It is likewise clear, that when the Chicken is now hatched, or excluded, he is
supplied with provisions, partly from the Yolk, and partly from the Chyle; and
that they both pass into the Liver by the same Vena Porta, though by several
branches of it.

It is also clear, (to speak by the way) that the Chyle which nourishes all
living creatures, is transported by the Meseraick Veins out of the Guts; and
that there is no need to search out new ways (namely the Venae Lacteae) or to
fancy any other passage in grown bodies, besides what we find in the Egg and
Chicken. But as for the Inconveniences of that invention, we shall elsewhere
discover them.

Lastly, by the constitution of the Umbilical Vessels in the Egg, (whereof we
have declared some to be Veins, and some Arteries) we may tollect a
Circulation of the Blood, (such as we have long since demonstrated in our Book,
de Motu Sanguin is in Animalibus) and that for vegetation, nutrition, and
augmentation sake: and therefore the Umbilical Vessels are disseminated into
both the Liquors, that they may lead sustenance from them to the foetus; and
the Arteries are derived thither too, that by a plentiful affluence of heat
they may concoct, dissolve, and render the aliment useful to nutrition.

And hence it comes to pass, that wheresoever the veins (and under that name
the Arteries also are here comprehended) do arrive to the substance of the
White or Yolk, those parts seem to be dissolved, and put on a different look or
appearance from the rest. For so soon as ever the branches of the Veins shoot
forth, the superior or exterior part of the White (into which they are
inserted) grows transparent, and melts into a Colliquntion; but the inferior
part remaining still thick, and compact, is confined to the Lower angle of the
Egg. So likewise there seem to be two parts (a superior and an inferior) of
the Yolk, which do as much differ from one another, as melted from unmelted
wax; namely, that part which has entertained Veins into it, from the other
which is yet destitute.

Hence also we are acquainted with the Exordium, and first inherent principle
of the Egg. For it is clear, that the Cicatricula or Speck, is the principal
particle of the Egg, to which all the rest are to be referred, and to which
(if to any part before another) whatsoever it be, which makes the Egg
prolifical, is to be imputed, as also the first onset toward the generation of
the Chicken. And therefore (as we have showed) presently after the Incubation
of the Hen, the Cicatricula is first of all dilated, enlarged, and makes a
Colliquation; wherein forthwith the blood moves, the veins are scattered, and
the operations and effects of the native heat, do by the help of the formative
Operatour, betray themselves; and by how much the deeper the small Filaments of
these veins do take rooting, by so much the wider is the Empire of the Vital
faculty advanced, and the Majesty of the Vegetal Soul revealed. For indeed
every Effect is a clear testimony of its Efficient.

In a word, upon the Cicatricula (wherein the first twy-light of native heat
does dawn) the whole Generation does depend: Upon the Heart, the whole Chicken,
and upon the Umbilical Vessels, all the Membranes involving the Foetus (which
we call the Secundine) do rely. Wherefore we conclude, that the parts of the
Foetus are in subordination one to the other, and do first borrow life from the
Heart.

Of the Order of parts in the Generaration out of an Egg, according to
Fabricius.
EXERCITATION LIVE.
IT being now resolved, which is to be esteemed the first part, namely the
Blood, with its Receptacles, the Heart, Veins, and Arteries; it now follows,
that we discover in what order all the parts of the Body are generated.

Fabricius (whose steps we trace in the Generation of the Pullus) ere he
proceed to the order of the Parts, does first recite the actions discovered in
an Egg, and by whose assistance the Parts are formed; repeating also in order
their Faculties: as if out of them the order also of the Generation of the
Parts may be more clearly discovered. There are three actions, says he, which
appear first in an Egg upon which the Hen sits: the first is, the Generation
of the Chicken; the second, its Growth; the third, its Nutrition. The first,
that is, the Generation, is the proper action of the Egg; the second and third
(namely accretion and nutrition) do for the greatest part come to a height out
of the egg; yet they are begun in the egg, and perfected there too. Which
actions, as they flow from three faculties, (the Generative, Augmentative, and
Nutritive) so three Effects do ensue upon them: For from generation do all the
parts of the Chicken result; from accretion and nutrition, Growth, and
Increase: treating first of the Generation of the Chicken, we may discover,
that by the help of Generation the parts of the Chicken (which were not before)
are produced, and so the Egg is transformed into the body of the Chicken. Now
while any part does commigrate into another, it must needs pass through a
commutation of its own proper essence; (for otherwise it must continue the same
thing still) and also must be fashioned into a figure, site, and magnitude
convenient and consistent with its nature: and in these two things is the
Procreation of a substance absolved, namely, Commutation, and Conformation;
therefore the Immutative and Formative faculties, are the causes of these
functions: Whereof the One has produced each particular part of the body, just
as we see it, out of the Chalaza of the Egg; the Other conferred the figure,
site, and composition convenient for all the several uses of it. The first of
these Faculties, which is the Immutative or Alterative faculty, is wholly
natural, and does act without any knowledge at all; and taking to it self, the
hot, the cold, the moist, and the dry parts, it alters the whole subance of the
Chalaza throughout, and by altering, it does change it into the parts of the
Chicken; that is to say, into Flesh, Bones, Gristles, Ligaments, Veins,
Arteries, Nerves, and into all the other similar and simple parts of the
Animal, or Chicken: and the Cocks seed does by its proper ingenit heat and
spirit, generate, create, and produce them out of the Egg (that is, the
Chalaza) by Alteration and Commutation; imparting to every one of them its
proper substance, and the proprieties belonging to that substance. The Other
faculty which is called Formative, and which makes the similar parts dissimilar
(bestowing their beauty upon them, from convenient figure, just dimension,
proper site, and competent number) being much more noble then the former, and
full of incomparable wisdom, does not act Naturally, but by Election or Choice,
Knowledge, and Understanding. For truly this Formative faculty seems to be
stored with most exact knowledge, and praevision, both of the future Action, and
also of the Use of every particular Part, and Organ. And thus of the first
Action of the Egg, which is the generation of the Chicken, to whose
celebration, both the seed of the Cock, as Agent, and Fructifier, and the
Chalaza, is required, as the subject Matter. Next comes Accretion, which is
done by Nutrition; whose Faculties are the Attractive, the Retentive, the
Digestive, and Expulsive faculties: and lastly, the Faculty of Apposition,
Agglutination, and Assimulation.

But as for this distribution of the Actions, I conceive it neither to be
right, nor useful, nor pertinent in this place. Not Right; because those
actions, which he seems to hold to be distinct, in their species, and time;
namely that the parts should be first made similar, by the Immutative faculty;
after that, formed, and made Organicall by the formative; and then augmented by
the augmentative) do no where appear so in the Generation of the Chicken; for
the parts are all generated, distinguished, and augmented together. For though
it be otherwise in the Generation of those Animals which are framed by a
Metamorphosis; where all the parts are transformed, and lineated out of a
pre-existent matter, which is large enough, and prepared before hand, (as when
out of a Worm is made a Butterfly, and out of another Worm a Silk-Worme) yet
in Generation by Epigenesis, the business is much otherwise, nor is the
proceeding there, as it is in Nutrition, which is performed by the diverse
actions of diverse parts, joining their confederate forces and helps together:
namely, where the Aliment is first attracted and retained; then concocted, then
distributed, and at last agglutinated. Nor is the similar constitution produced
by the Alterative faculty, without all kind of providence (as Fabricius would
have it) And the Organical, by the Formative, which imployes knowledge and
providence in her undertakings. For Generation and Accretion, are not made
without Nutrition, nor Nutrition, or Augmentation, without Generation. For to
Nourish, is to substitute into the place of that which is lost, as much, and
such as is lost: namely, Flesh, or Nerves, into the room of that Flesh, and
those Nerves, which are impared. And what is this other, then to make Flesh, or
Nerves? So likewise Accretion is not without Generation: For all Natural
bodies, are Augmented, by a new accession of those parts, of which they did
consist before: and that according to all dimensions: So that they at once do
grow, are distinguished, and organized together,

And now, to Generate a Chicken, is nothing else, but to constitute all its
parts, members and organs: which though they are made in order, and some are
post-genit, or later productions then others (as the less principal parts,
compared with the more principal) yet while the organs themselves are
distinguished, their generation does not proceed in such order, that the
similar parts must be first made, and the organical be afterward compounded
out of them: as if the compounding parts were first to exist, and then the
Composition to be raised out of them. For though the Head of the Chicken, and
the rest of its Trunck, or corporature (being first of a similar constitution)
do resemble a Mucus, or a soft glewey substance: out of which afterward all
the parts are framed in their order: yet by the same operation, and the same
Operatour, they are together made and augmented: and as that substance
resembling glue does grow, so are the parts distinguished. Namely, they are
Generated, Altered, and formed at once: they are at once similar and
dissimilar: and from a small similar, is a great organ made. In the same manner
as out of the straw, the spike, reeds, and grains do arise, and are
distinguished: and as the Trees, when they shoot forth their young buds, do out
of them, expand and produce flowers, leaves, fruit, and at last, seed.

And this we have learnt out of those things which are conspicuous in an egg,
by diligent observation of them. For by the effects, the actions, or operations
are perceived; by the operations, the faculties, and by them, the Operatour or
Efficient. Wherefore in the Generation of the Chicken, the actions or faculties
of the Generant (which Fabricius recites; namely, the Immutative and Formative)
do not differ Specie, nor yet secundum prius and posterius, but (as Aristotle
uses to speak) ipso esse, and ratione solum: not as it befalls the actions of
the nutritive faculty, after the birth, (to wit, Attraction, Concoction,
Distribution, and Apposition) which perform their duties in several places,
and at several times. For otherwise the Generative faculty her self, should be
enforced also to use diverse instruments to perform her several operations.

Wherefore Fabricius affirms amiss, that the Immutative Faculty does operate
by the qualities of the Elements, namely, Heat, Cold, Moisture, and Dryness:
(as being its instruments) but that the formative works without them, and after
a more divine manner: as if (forsooth) she did finish her task, with
meditation, choice, and providence. For had he looked deeper into the thing, he
would have seen, that the Formative, as well as the Alterative faculty makes
use of hot, cold, moist, and dry, (as her instruments) and would have
deprehended as much divinity and skill, in Nutrition and Immutation, as in the
operations of the Formative faculty her self. For nature has instituted all
those faculties for some end; and does every where work with providence, and
understanding. Whatsoever it is which makes the seed of Plants fruitful, and
does exercise a plastic virtue in it: and that which in an egg executes the
office of a most skilful Workman, does produce and build the parts, and by
Calefying Refrigerating, Moistning, Drying, Concocting, Condensing, Hardening,
Softning, Dissolving, both Fashion, and Augment them; does also distinguish
them, by Figure, Site, Constitution, Temperature, Number, and Order: disposing
and completing all things, with like providence, election, and understanding,
(no less in the alteration, then nutrition, augmentation, and formation of
them.)

I say the Concocting, and Immutative; the Nutritive, and Augmenting faculties;
(which Fabricius would have to busy themselves only about Hot, Cold, Moist,
and Dry, without all knowledge) do operate with as much artifice, and as much
to a designed end, as the Formative faculty: which he affirms, to possess the
knowledge and foresight of the future action, and use of every particular
part, and Organ.

As the Art of Physic, the Bakers and the Cooks slight (which set on work, the
hot, cold, moist, and dry, and such like natural Instruments) do no less
require the exercise of reason, then Mechanical Trades, which either work with
their own hand, (as the Smith, the Statuaries, and the Potters) or other
artificial instruments. But as in the greater world, we say, Jovis omnia plena,
All things are full of the Deity, so also in the little edifice of a Chicken,
and all its actions and operations, Digitus Dei, the Finger of God, or the God
of Nature, does reveal himself.

Therefore if it be lawful for us to judge of the faculties by the operations;
the Vegetal Operations do rather seem to be executed by Art, Election, and
Providence; then the very actions of the Rational soul, and the Mind, though in
a most perfect man, the top and pinnacle of whose Knowledge and Understanding,
consists chiefly (according to Apollos verdit) in this, ut no seat se ipsum,
that he know himself. A more sublime, and diviner Artificer therefore (then man
is) seems to make and preserve man: and a nobler Agent then a Cock, does
produce a Chicken out of the Egg. For we acknowledge our Omnipotent God, and
most high Creator, to be every where present in the structure of all creatures
living; and to point himself out by his Works; whose Instruments the Cock and
Hen are in the Generation of the Chicken. For it is most apparent, that in the
Generation of the Chicken out of the egg, all things are set up and formed,
with a most singular providence, divine wisdom, and an admirable, and
Incomprehensible Artifice.

Nor can these Attributes appertain to any, but to the Omnipotent Maker of all
things, under what name soever we cloud and veil him: whether it be, Men's
divina, the divine Mind, with Aristotle, or Anima mundi, the soul of the
Universe, with Plato; or with others, Natura Naturans, Nature of Nature her
self; or else Saturnus, or Jupiter, with the Heathen; or rather, as befits us,
the Creator, and Father of all things in Heaven, and Earth: upon whom all
Animals, and their births depend: and at whose Beck, or Mandat, all things are
created, and begotten.

Moreover (as I have observed) this distribution of the Actions, or faculties
of the Soul (which Fabricius does premise to the order of Generation of the
parts) as I apprehend it to be faulty, so also I conceive it to be unprofitable
and inconvenient, or impertinent to our business. For we do not attain to the
knowledge of the Effect, by the knowledge of the actions or faculties, but
rather on the contrary, from the Effects we ascend to the Faculties; for the
effects or works are notiora nobis, more known unto us, then the faculties
from whence they spring: and the parts (which we see made already) are more
intelligible in Generation, then the actions which framed them.

Nor do those things which are to be considered and determined in the general
observation of all Animals, fall properly within the compass of the particular
generation of the Chicken out of the Egg. But of them more hereafter.

In the mean time, we shall proceed to the Order of the Generation of the
parts. It remains, says Fabricius, that we consider and contemplate in what
Order, that is, which part is made first, and which after in the Egg. In
prosecution whereof there are two foundations to be laid: one in respect of the
body: the other in relation to the incorporeal substance, as, the Nature or
Soul. I call that (says he) the Corporeal foundation, which depends upon, and
flows from the Nature of the body: and whereof an instance is easily deduced
from things made by art: For, as every edifice does first require a foundation,
upon which the whole frame is to be laid and supported: whence the walls are
set up, which do sustain the Floors and Roof: and then the Household Stuff,
and other furniture are introduced; so does nature proceed in the Fabric of
Animals. For first she lays the Bones as the foundation, that all the parts of
the Body may grow to, hang, upon, and be established by them. Which bones are
first made under another capacity. For since Bones take their first rise from a
most soft and membranous substance, and do afterward attain their
induration; therefore much time must be allotted to the Generation of the
Bones, that so they may become the hardest parts; and hereupon they are
begotten first. And for this reason Galen did not compare the structure of an
Animal to every kind of building, but chiefly to that of a Ship. For, says he,
as the foundation and original of the Ship is the Keel, from which the sides,
or planks imbowed, and placed at a distance one from the other (like a Hurdle)
are set up on both sides, that so the whole frame of the Ship may be afterward
finished out of the Keel, as a convenient foundation; So in the fabric of an
Animal, Nature first stretches out the Chine bone, with the Ribs drawn round
it, as the Keel, and congruous principle, whereon she foundeth and finisheth
the whole Pile.

But Experience does abundantly confute this fancy: for it is evident, that
the Bones are rather made last of all. For the Bones of the Limbs, the Skull
and Teeth, are not made before the Brain, the Muscles, and fleshey parts; but
even after the nativity, in the tender, and (otherwise) perfect foetus, they
are only Gristles, and Membranes, and afterward in tract of time arrive to
the solidity of Bones, as does appear by Infants Skulls, and the Ribs and
Joints of Embryo's.

And though it be true, that the first platform of the body appears like a
Bent or incurved Keel, yet is it of a soft, mucous, and glutinous consistence,
no way resembling either the Nature, Constitution, or Office of a Bone. As also
the small Globous bodies which are its appendixes (designed for the parts of
the Head) have no solidity at all in them, but are only Vesicles stuffed with
clear water, which are afterward transformed into the Brain, After-braine, and
Eyes; and are at last fenced with the Skull, namely, after the Bill, and Claws
have attained solidity, and obduration.

Wherefore this Contemplation of Fabricius is a sleepy, and injurious one; He
not considering what really is done by nature in the order of Generation, but
rather what nature according to his fancy, ought to have done; as if Nature
did imitate Art, and Art were not rather Natures Ape. Which coming into his
head, himself afterward says, Satius fuerit dicere, etc. It is a more
diliberate page 44.
assertion to say, that Art was Natures Scholar, and wrought by her Copy:
because as Galen every where pronounces, Nature is of more Antiquity, and
wiser in her productions then Art.

And though the bones are the foundation of the whole body, without which it
can nor stand nor move: yet it is sufficient for them, if they are made
together with those parts, which do rely upon them. For where the things which
are to be upheld are not in being, the Props are provided to no purpose. But
nature does nothing rashly; nor constitutes parts, before there is use of them.
But all Animals attain their parts, so soon as action and usefulness is
required of them. And therefore this first foundation of Fabricius his laying,
countenanced by his own observations in the Egg, and Galens simile, is clean
demolished.

He seems to come nearer the Mark, when he says, The other foundation of
producing the parts in order, is desumed from Nature, that is, the soul; which
is Queen Regent of the animal body. For since there are two degrees of the
soul, the Vegetal and Sensative; and the Vegetal is, tempore and natura prior,
first both in time and nature, because it is common to the very Plants;
doubtless the Instruments subservient to the Vegetal, are first to be made and
fitted, before those that attend the sensitive and motive faculties: especially
the more principal ones, and where the Queen keeps Court. Now these are chiefly
two, the Liver, and the Heart: the Liver as the throne of the Vegetal or
Nutritive: and the Heart as that Minister of State, who by his heat and warmth,
does enliven and complete both the Vegetal, and other Faculties, and therefore
holds a strong league and confederacy with the Vegetal. Wherefore if after
three days Incubation, you discern in that part of the egg where the Chicken
is bred, the heart panting, (as Aristotle also testifies) muse not at it, but
conclude that the heart relates to the vegetal Faculty, and is therefore the
first begotten. Now it is also consonant to Reason, that the Liver also should
be Twinne to the Heart, and born with it, but does not appear, because he wants
a palpitation, which the Heart has. For even Aristotle himself says, That the
Liver and the Heart are constituted in the body upon like grounds; so that if
there be a Heart, there must be a Liver too. If therefore the Liver and Heart
are first begotten, it also follows, that the other Organs that are menial
servants relating to these two, should be begotten together with them; as, the
Lungs for the Heart; and for the Liver, almost all the parts which are
contained in the Lower Belly.

But all this is very wide from that order and progress which we see in the
Egg. Nor is it true, that the Liver is born together with the Heart: nor will
that shift serve his turn, where he pretends, Latere Jecur, quia non palpitat,
that the Liver lies concealed, because it is not exposed by palpitation. For
the Eyes, the Vena Cava, and the Carina, the Keel, are discerned even from the
very first, yet have they no palpitation. What impediment then to bar the
Liver and Lungs (if they are then in being) from being seen? Nay, he himself,
in his Figure or Table, representing the fourth day, has described a small
Point in the midst, and yet he has not signified any palpitation belonging to
it; nor did he own it for the Heart, but supposed it to be the first rudiment
of the body: wherefore he speaks only out of conjecture, and preentertained
opinion, when he proclaims the Principality of the Liver: as other men have
also done, (namely, Aldrovandus, and Parisanus) who casually lighting upon two
Points, and could not discover a Pulse in both, at one and the same time,
conceived the one to be the Heart, and the other the Liver. As if the Liver had
any pulse at all; but those two Points are the two Vesiculae Pulsantes,
returning answer to each other in alternate contractions; as has been noted in
our History.

Wherefore, either Fabricius is deceived, or does deceive, where he says,
Presently in the first progress of generation, the Liver, Heart, Veins,
Arteries, Lungs, and all the parts contained in the lower belly; likewise the
Keel, that is, the Head, with the Eyes, and the whole Spine and Chest, are born
and framed. For the Heart, Veins, and Arteries, are perfectly distinguished,
for some time, before the Keel; and the Carina, or Keel, before the Eyes; and
the Eyes, the Bill, and Sides, before the Members contained in the lower belly:
and also the Stomach, and Guts, before the Liver, or Lungs, are discerned. And
that order is observed in generation, which we shall presently describe.

He is likewise deceived, when he decrees the Vegetal part to have a being both
in time and nature before the sensitive and the motive. For that which is first
in Nature, is for the most part after, in the order of Generation. In time,
indeed, the Vegetal part is before, because the sensitive soul cannot be
without it. For it cannot actually exist in the body without Organs, it being
Actus corporis Organici, the Act of the Organical body: but the sensitive and
motive Organs, are the workmanship of the vegetative; and the sensitive soul
(before it actually exist) is tanquam Trigonus in Tetragono, like a Triangle in
a Quadrangle. But Nature first intends that which is most principal and noble;
and therefore the Vegetal faculty is after in the order of Nature, as being
subservient to the sensitive, and motive Faculty.

Of the Order of Parts in Generation, according to Aristotle.
EXER. LV.
THat which relates to the order of Generation, according to Aristotle, is
thus: When the Conception De genesis an. l. 2. c. 4.
is ordained, it proceeds as Seeds do. For Seeds also have a first Principle in
themselves; which being first contained in potentia, when by and by it is
severed, it sends forth a bud, and a root, whereby it attracts aliment; for it
requires growth. So in some sort in a conception, where the parts are all in
potentia, the Principle is chiefly active.

This Principle in an Egg (analogous to the blossom of Plants) we with
Fabricius call Macula, a Speck, or Cicatricula, a small Cicatrice: which we
have avouched to be the principal particle, in which all the other parts are in
potentia, and whence afterward they arise in their order. For in it is
contained that thing (be it what it will) which renders the Egg prolifical;
and there is the first effect of the vegetal heat, and operation of the Forming
faculty first discovered.

Macula isthaec, that Speck (as has been showed) is presently dilated after
incubation, and divided into Circles; in whose Center a small white Point (like
the Cicatricula, in the ball of the Eye) does display it self: where by and by
the Punctum rubrum, the Red point, is discovered panting, with the capillary
branches of Veins containing blood; and that presently, so soon as ever the
Colliquamentum by us mentioned, is framed of that Macula.

Wherefore Aristotle proceeds; The Heart is first actually discerned; and that
not only discoverable to Ibid.
sense, but according to reason. For since that which is begotten is now
disjoined from both parents, it ought to demean, govern, and dispose of it
self, as a Son set free by his Father, and seated apart. And therefore a
Principle, and that an Intrinsecal one, must needs be had, by which afterward
the order of the Parts is to be prescribed, and all things relating to the
complement of the Animal, managed, and disposed. For if it were Extrinsecal at
any time, and afterward began to enter in, you would not only be in suspense,
and question when it went in, but conclude, that since each part is
distinguished, it was necessary that part should subsist, out of which both
growth and motion is conferred upon the other parts. In another place he says,
The first Principle is a part of the whole, and not any separate thing, which
is contained apart from it. For, says he, when the Animal is now generated, is
that Principle corrupted, or does it remain? Now nothing seems to be in, which
is not a part of the whole, be it Plant, or Animal. And that it should be
corrupted, when it has been at the expense of making all, or some of the
parts, is very absurd; for what shall make the remainder? Wherefore (he
proceeds) who side with Democritus, saying, That the exterior parts of the
Animal are first made, and then the interior: as if they were to build a
wodden or stony Animal, do not say well; for such a creature as that has no
Principle in it self. But all Animals have, and contain one within them.
Whereupon the Heart is first seen in all Animals, in which there is blood; for
that is the Principle of the similar, and dissimilar parts. Now that thing
which requires Aliment, ought already to have received that principle of an
Animal, and constituted Foetus.

Which words do plainly declare, that Aristotle did conclude of an Order in the
Generation of Animals, and of a Principal part, namely, the Heart, which (like
a Son at liberty) is the first animate, and primogenit part of the Animal,
contained, and abiding in it: whence not only the method of the parts is set
down, but the Animal it self, preserved, and relyes upon it, receiving
continual life and sustenance; and that thence, whatsoever is necessary to the
perfection of the Animal, is derived. For, (as Seneca says) in the Seed is the
whole Not. quest. l. 3. c. 19.
account of the future Man comprehended. And the Infant yet unborn has a
Standard and Commission for a Beard, and a Gray-head. For the dimension of his
body, and ensuing years, are already deciphered in a small, mysterious
character.

Now whether the Heart be the Primigenial part, or no, we have determined
above. To wit, if Aristotle's speech be understood of that part, which (in the
Anatomy of Living creatures) is seen by the eye to be before the rest, (that
is, of the Punctum saliens, together with the Veins streaming with blood) we
cheerfully embrace his judgment. For we believe, that the Blood, together with
the Vessels, and Instruments; namely, the Umbilical Veins, (by which, as by
Roots, the Nutriment is attracted) and Vesiculae pulsantes (to whom it is
distributed for the life and growth of the parts) is constituted before any
other. For (as Aristotle says) the matter by which any thing is augmented, and
out of which it is first made, is one and the same.

But they are much abused, who conceive, that the diverse parts of the Body are
sustained with a diverse aliment. As though Nutrition were nothing but a bare
choice, and attraction of aliment: and that no concoction, assimilation,
apposition, and transmutation, were required of the particular parts which are
to be nourished: which was the opinion of Anaxagoras of old. Lucret. l. 1.

Who said, that Things from their Likeparts begin;
That Bones from less, and fewer Bones do spring;
And Intrals rise from Intrals, Blood from Blood,

But Aristotle most truly says: Distinction of parts is not, as some suppose,
upon that ground, that Like is In the place before cited.
of its own nature tending to its Like: for besides many other difficulties
which beset that opinion, it will follow, that every similar part must be
ordained apart by it self: as for instance; Bones by themselves, Nerves, and
Flesh by themselves, in case that opinion be admitted. But, indeed, the
Nutriment of all parts is common and similar, as the Yolk in the Egg; and not
heterogeneous, and compounded of diverse parts. And therefore what we have said
concerning the matter out of which the Parts are made: we pronounce the same of
the matter out of which they are augmented; namely, that the parts do assume
their Nourishment out of that matter, in which all the Parts are in potentia,
but none actu.

As out of the same Shower all kinds of Plants take growth, because that
moisture, which was before like in potentia to them all, is now made like them
actu, being transformed into their substance; And is also bitter in Rue, sharp
in the Mustard, and sweet in Licorise; and so in the rest.

He goes on, to explain what Parts are generated before others; and that with a
reason not much unlike Fabricius his Fundamentum secundum, his second ground or
foundation, saying, Id cujus causa, and quod ejus causa, differunt; and alterum
generatione, alterum essentia prius est; namely, the End is first in Nature and
Essence, in respect of that thing which is made for the Ends sake; but That
which is made for the Ends sake, must needs be first in Generation. And by that
Argument Fabricius rightly inferrs, that those Parts which are subservient to
the Vegetative soul, are all made before those which are instrumental to the
sensative, because that is subordinate to this.

After this, he subjoines the differences of such things as are made for any
End; namely, that some things are instituted for some End by nature, because
the End does ensue upon them: but some, because they are Instruments which the
End makes use of: and those he calls Genitalia, but these, Instrumentalia. For
the End, says he, in some things is after, and in some, before those things
which are their causes. For the Generant himself, and that which he imployes in
Generation, must needs exist before that which is generated by them. And
therefore the Parts subservient to the Vegetative soul, are before those which
are retained by Sense, and Motion. But the Parts dedicated to Motion and the
Senses, are after the sensitive and motive Faculties; as being instrumental,
and made use of by the sensitive and motive Faculty. For by Natures Law, no
Parts or Instruments are made and constituted, before there be employment for
them, and a faculty be ready at hand, to set them to work. So neither the Eye,
nor the Instruments of Motion are set up, till the Brain is built, or the
faculty be already provided, which is to See, or Move.

In like manner, because the Vesiculae pulsantes do (as Instruments) minister
to the motion of the Blood; and likewise the whole Frame and Fabric of the
Heart (as we have evidenced in our Book de Motu Sanguinis) is Instrumental;
(namely, that the Blood may be continually hurried round the Body in a Circle)
the Blood seems to have a being both in Order of Nature and Generation before
the Heart; which he imployes as an Instrument, having begotten it also, and
does persist to nourish, and convey heat, spirits, and life unto it by the
Coronal Artery.

But how this General Rule of Aristotle concerning the prae-ordering of the
Parts, does appear to be true by Anatomical Observation, we shall declare
hereafter. In the mean time, we will enquire, after what manner he himself does
sufficiently deduce the Causes of Priority, as I may so say, in Generation,
according to this Rule.

After the Principle (namely the Heart) are the Interior parts begotten,
before the exterior; the superior, before the inferior: for the inferior
are for the superiors sakes, as being their instrument: after the pattern
observed in Plants, which shoot forth their Roots, before their Branches.

But Nature does not use that method in Generation; nor is the instance always
true; for in Beans, Ciches, and other Pulse, also in Acornes or Mast, and
Corn, it is apparent that at the same time, the Stalk shootes upward from the
same Bud, and the Roots downward. Likewise Onions, and other bulbous plants, do
germinate upwards before they fix downwards.

But he adjoines another cause of this order; to wit, Nature makes nothing
superfluous, nor nothing in vain, whence it appears, that nothing is made by
her, either before or after another, otherwise then need requires. Namely,
those parts are first generated, whose uses and functions are first required:
some also are sooner begun, because they call for more time to perfect them,
that so they may be ready for the birth, together with others that are
forwarder then they. As the Cook being to provide a feast, where some
provisions (by reason of their solidity) ask a slower fire, and longer time to
prepare them, he lays them down to the fire first: but to those that are
sooner dispatched, and are dressed with a gentler heat, he applies himself
last: and such also as are to be served up in the first course, he makes ready
first, but those in the second, last. So likewise nature, in the generation of
Animals, is late ere she delineate the moist, soft, and fleshey parts, (as
being quickly cooked, and reduced into shape) but for the hard and more solid
(as the bones) because they exact a large Evaporation, and Exsiccation, and
their matter continues long indigested, to them she addresses her self first
of all. For in the Brain also, says he, the same falls out, namely, that at
first it is very moist, and great in quantity: but anon, the humidity
evaporating, and being concocted, it grows more solid, and so the quantity of
the Head, and Eyes, do abate. In the beginning therefore, the Head seems very
big (in comparison of all the rest of the body, which it much exceeds in
bulk) by reason of the Brain: and the eyes very large, by reason of the
humor contained in them. But yet the eyes are perfected last; because even the
Brain it self is long ere it grow to a consistence. For it is long ere it get
the mastery, and drein the water, and especially in a Man. For the Sinciput is
last confirmed of all the Bones; for that bone is yet soft, even when the Child
is born into the World.

He also proceeds to another reason; namely, that the parts are framed of
different materials. The more noble parts, (says he) and those that
participate the worthiest principles, are constituted of the concocted, purest,
and chiefest aliment: the other necessary parts, made for their sakes, are
fashioned out of the baser matter, the relics, and dregs. For Nature, like a
prudent Master of a Family, loses nothing, out of which he can make any
advantage, but so manages the matter in his house, that his Children may fare
best, his Servants harder then they, and the scraps or refuse thrown to the
Dogs. As therefore, Incremento jam addito, men's advena facit haec, that is, (as
I interpret it) a prudent man grown to years of discretion, disposes thus of
his Charge; So in the framing of things, Nature (by an inbred wisdom and
prudence) forms the flesh, and substance of the instruments of sense, out of
the most refined matter, but the Bones, Nerves, Hair, Nails, Hoofes, and the
like, out of the Dregs, (that is the refuse, remainders, or fragments) And
therefore these are made last, when nature has now good store of course
materials. And after this, he distinguishes of two sorts of Aliment; one of
Nutrition, the other of Augmentation. That of Nutrition, says he, does supply
a being to the whole, and all the parts, that of augmentation procures an
accession to the magnitude.

According to what we find in the Egg; where the White (as the more refined
Aliment) relates to the first Nutrition of the Chicken; the Yolk to its
augmentation. And the thinner White (as has been showed) conduces to the
formation of the First, and nobler Parts; but the Courser, and the Yolk, to the
augmentation of the Nobler, and formation of the more Ignoble. For, he says,
the Nerves are framed as the Bones, out of the seminal and nutritive excrement.
But the Nails, Hair, Spurs, and all like these, are formed out of
augmentative, and adventitious meats; which the Foetus both receives from the
Mother, and also does provide of it self. And after this he at last gives the
reason, why Man (since other Animals are provided with their Garments, and
Weapons at Natures price) should be borne naked, and unarmed; namely, that
those kind of parts are constituted of the excrementitious parts, and relics,
but the materials of Men are purer, in which there is very little terrene, or
crude excrement to be found.

And thus far have we made use of Aristotle, concerning the Order of
Generation: where all seems to be bottomed upon one foundation; namely, Natures
Perfection; which in all her Workmanship, has nothing short, nor nothing
superfluous, but always disposes matters for the best. And therefore no parts
had been precedent or subsequent to one another, if it had been more
advantageous to have formed them altogether; which is to be understood of Her,
as often as she acts freely, and by choice. For sometimes she acts otherwise,
being as it were under constraint, and put beside her purpose; which happens,
when either by defect of matter, or superfluity thereof, or by the default of
her instruments, or some outward impediments, she is hindered in her work, and
frustrated of her aim, or end. And hence it comes to pass sometimes, that the
final parts are generated before the Instrumental: I call those final parts,
which employ others, (as their instruments.)

And because some parts are Genital parts, which Nature sets to work about the
Generation of other parts, or else to remove some Obstructions in her
proceedings, which in case they continue, the Generation may be retarded: and
others are under another capacity: therefore it comes to pass, that according
to the disposition of the matter, and other requisites, the parts are diversely
made some after other, and some of them are in hand before, but are not
finished till afterward: some are begun and finished before others are begun,
and others are as soon begun as their fellows, but finished after them. And
therefore in the generation of some Animals, the same order is not always
observed, but it is much different and various; and in some no order at all:
but all the parts are begun, and finished at a heat: namely by a Metamorphosis,
as we showed. And lastly, hence it happens that the Primogenit part is such,
that in it is concluded both the Beginning, and the End; as well that for whose
sake all are made (namely the soul) as also that which is its cause in chief,
and Genital part. The Heart therefore (or, according to my persuasion, the
Blood) is the first throne of the Soul; the fountain of life; the Vestal fire;
the Genital warmth; and the very Calidum Innatum; the first Efficient of all
his ministering parts, having atcheived the soul for his end, which commands
them all as her leige-people. The Heart I say, (as Aristotle will have it) is
he, for whose sake the whole Fabric and Family of the parts are provided, and
who also is the Fountain, and Father of them all.

Of the Order of Parts in Generation, as it appears by our Observations.
EXER. LVI.
THat we may at last propose our own opinion of the Order of Parts, as we have
collected it out of several Observations of our own; we intend to distinguish
the whole work of Generation (in all Animals whatsoever) into two Fabrics.

Whereof the first is that of the Egg; namely, of the Conception, and Seed, or
of that, whatsoever it is, which (in Spontaneous productions) answers in
proportion to Seed; whether we understand it under the notion of Calidum
nativum coeleste in humido primigenio, the Innate celestial substance, in the
Primigenial moist, with Fernelius, or with Aristotle, of Calor Vitalis in
humors comprehensus, the vital heat concluded in moisture. For the Conception
in Viviparous Animals (as we have said) is answerable to the Seed and Fruit of
Plants; as also the Egg, in Oviparous; in Spontaneous productions, the Worm,
or some Bulla teeming by the Vital heat of the contained moisture. In all which
the same thing is comprehended, which may truly call them Seeds; namely, out of
which, and by which (as the matter, and Efficient, and pre-existent Organ)
every Animal is first made and borne.

The Other Fabric is of the Foetus, born out of the Seed, or Conception. For
the Matter, and the Final, and Efficient causes, and the Instruments necessary
to the work, must first be, before any part of the Production can begin.

The Fabric of the Egg we have already seen: but that of the Foetus (so far
as we could discover out of dissections) is perfected (especially in the more
perfect race of Animals, and such as have blood) chiefly by four degrees, or
processions: which according to the several times of generation, we shall
reduce into as many Orders; demonstrating withal that the same thing which is
discerned in the Egg, is alike in every conception and seed.

The First progress is of the Primogenit, and Genital part, namely of the
blood, with its receptacles, or if you will have it so, of the Heart and his
Veins.

Now this part is first begotten, chiefly for two reasons, both because it is
the principal part, which makes use of all the rest, as its Instruments; and
for whose sake the other parts seem to be produced: as also, because it is the
Chief Genital part, the Fountain and Author of the rest; The part in which is
concluded both the Beginning and End of Generation; the same being Pater and
Rex, Parent, and Sovereign.

In the Generation of these Parts, (which is determined in the Egg the Fourth
day) though I could not observe any Order; because all its particles (Blood,
Veins, and Vesicula pulsans) appear at once; yet I believe (as I said) that the
blood is in it, before the Pulse: and that it also in Natures Law, is before it
receptacles, the Veins: for the substance and structure of the Heart (namely
the one with its Ventricles and Auricles) as it is generated long after with
the other Intrals, so ought it to be registered in their Classis, which is the
Third.

In this structure, the veins are conspicuous before the Arteries, at least,
as far as we could observe.

The Second Journal, which sets out after the fourth day, discovers a certain
Concrementum, or coagulated substance, which I call Vermiculum, seu Galbam, the
little Worm, or Magot; (for it seems to enjoy the life and obscure motion of a
Galba) and this, as it congeals into a gelly, is divided into two parts;
whereof the upper and the larger is conglobated, and distinguished into three
Vesicles; namely, that of the Brain, After-brain, and one of the Eyes: but the
lesser, carinam referens, resembling the Keel of a Ship, is superinduced upon
the Vena Cava, and is extended according to its length.

In the structure of the Head, the Eyes are first discerned, and anon a white
spot starts up for the Bill, and the filme drying about, it becomes protected
by a membrane.

At this time also the adumbration, or rough draft of the rest of the Body
seems to succeed; where first upon the Carina the sides or plancks, as it were,
of a Boat seem to arise; being at first of a similar consistence, but
afterward by most white streaks they are signified to be the lines of the
Ribs. After this, the members of Motion, namely, the Wings and Legs do appear:
and at last the Keel, and Limbs born by a kind of Superfoetation, are
distinguished into Muscles, Bones, and Joints.

Those two first misshapen materials of the Head and Body, do together appear,
and are together distinguished: but afterward, when they tend toward growth
and perfection, the body gets the start, and is much sooner grown and shaped;
so that the Head which did at first outstrip the whole body beside, in bulk
and magnitude, is now very much short of it. And this is likewise natural to
humane productions.

The like Disparity is between the Body it self and the Limbs; for in an
Infant (from that time that the Embryo exceeds not the length of the Nail of
the little Finger, till he be increased to the stature of a Frog, or a Mouse)
his Arms are so short, that if you stretch out his fingers over his breast, to
their farthest extent, they will not be able to touch one another; and his
thighs are so short, that being reflected upon his Abdomen, they will hardly
reach to his Navel.

Nay, in Children lately born, the proportion of the bulk of the Body is a
pretty deal larger then that of the Limbs, until they are able to stand, and
go. And therefore Infants are first Dwarfs, and crawle like beasts, and attempt
to move on, though upon all four: but go upright they cannot, till the
prolixity of their Legs and Thighs exceed the longitude of the rest of the
Body. And hence is it, that their first venture to foot it, represents them a
prone kind of Cattle, which can scarce exalt themselves to the erection of a
Cock.

And therefore amongst grown persons, the long slimme Fellows, (whose Thighs,
but especially their Shanks, are longer then ordinary) can stand, walk, run, or
vault longer, and at more ease, then square, and well trussed men.

In this second Process, several actions of the Formative faculty pursuing one
another, may be observed; (as in the Automata, or engines that go of
themselves; where the foregoing wheel sets his follower upon motion too) and
all the parts spring from the same gelly, and similar substance. Not as De genesis
an, l. 2. c. 4.
some Natural Philosophers expound it, who say, that Like is hurried unto its
like: but we must say, That the parts are moved not by changing their station,
but remaining where they were, and altering in softness, hardness, complexion,
and those other differences of similar parts; being now made those things Actu,
which they were before in Potentia: that is, the Limbs, the Spine, and the rest
of the Body, are altogether formed and increased, are together described, and
complexioned: also the Bones, Flesh, Nerves, and Gristles, which were all
similar at first in the same members, and of one kind of substance, in
progress of Time are plainly distinct; and being conjoined, make up Organical
Parts, by whose mutual connection and continuity the whole body is compiled. So
in the Head, the membrane growing every where light, the Brain arrives to its
consistence, the Eyes are polished out of a fluid instable moisture.

Nature does feed and enlarge all the Parts, out of the self same Nutriment,
whereof the first did frame them, (not as many will have it, out of a diverse
one, and such as is like to every particle) namely, by augmenting her same
gelly, or worm: and like a potter, first she divides her materials, and she
allots to the Trunk, the Head, and the Limbs, every one their share or cantlin:
as Painters do, who first draw the Lineaments, and then lay on the Colors: and
as a Ship Carpenter, first lays the Keel for a foundation, and then sets up
the Ribs, and Breast Bone, or Deck: and as he builds a boat, so does Nature the
Trunk of the Body, and hasp on the Joints. And in her work, she begins all the
similary part out of the same Primitive gelly, or glutinous mass, (namely, the
Bones, Gristles, Flesh, Nerves, etc.) For at first there appears nothing of the
Bones, but a kind of filaments, or threddy fibers; which afterward become
nervous, anon Gristles, after that, like thorns, and at last down right Bones.
So likewise the thicker Membrane investing the Brain, proceeds first to be
gristly, and afterward into a Skull: while the thin Membrane does improve into
a Coat, or Pericranium, and Flesh. And in the same Order the Flesh, and Nerves,
out of a yiedling gelly, do concoct and strengthen, into Muscles, Tendons, and
Ligaments: The brain, and after-braine, from a thin Water, coagulate into a
Callous Curd; for the brain of Infants, before the bones of the Synciput are
confirmed, appears soft and fluid, and has no more coherence, then coagulated
Milk.

The third Process is of the Intrals; whose generation is discovered in the
Chicken, after the delineation of the body; (namely about the sixth or seventh
day) and near upon the same time, they all appear, that is, the Liver, Lungs,
Kidneys, the Cone of the Heart and its ventricles, and also the Guts. But their
first original is from the Veins, and are bred growing to them, (like Wens to
the bark of Trees) and at first they appear white, bloodless, and like a
gelly; and so continue till they are ripe for public employment. The Guts with
the Stomach seem at first like white threads, waved or contorted, extended
through the longitude of the belly: and together with them the Fabric of the
Mouth is discovered; from which to the Fundament in a continued procession, the
top is united and linked to the bottom: the Genitals also are about this time
visible.

Yet hitherto the Bowels and Guts are not shut up within the hollow of the
body, but being fastened as it were to the Veins hang forth: and thus does even
the Heart himself. For the trunk of the body hitherto resembles a Skiff without
a deck, or a House without a roof; as being hitherto no way covered over by the
anteriour parts; namely, the Breast, and Abdomen.

But so soon as the Sternum, or breast bone is framed, the Heart enters into
the breast, as into a habitation of his own setting up, and furnished purposely
for him; and being now retired, like the Genius of the place, he undertakes the
patronage of the whole Mansion; and there dwells, with his servants the Lungs.
After this, the Heart and Stomach retreat too; and at last the Guts shroud
themselves in the Belly. So that in a Hen-egge after the tenth day of
Incubation, the Heart admits no spectators without dissection.

About this time the top of the Bill, and the Claws break forth, being all
exceeding white; and now a chylous matter is visible in the Stomach, and a kind
of Excrement in the Guts; and the Liver being now begun has the Gall, which
appears green adjoined to it. By which it appears, that a different Concoction,
and Preparation of the Aliment is now made, (whereof these are the Excrements,
from that which is performed by the Propagations of the Umbilical Vessels: so
that a just doubt may hence arise, how Choler (the Excrement of the Second
Concoction) can be separated from the rest of the Humors by the Livers help,
when it is it self in being at the same time with the Liver.

The Interior parts are Universally generated, after the Order proposed: for
in all Animals (which I ever diffected) they are framed after the same Manner,
and Order: and especially in the more perfect, in Four-footed Beasts, and so in
Man himself; In whom the Heart, Liver, Lungs, Spleen, and Guts, appear framed,
and augmented in the Second, Third, and Fourth Months, at which times they are
white, as also the whole Body. And hereupon the first days are not improperly
called in lacte dies, the Days in the Milk; for the Bowels, and all the other
parts appear spermatical, except only the Veins, and chiefly those of the
Navel.

The Umbilical Arteries are, I conceive, framed after their Name-sakes, the
Veins; because they are scarce to be found in the first months, and take
their Original from the Branches which descend to the Thighs: And therefore, I
conceive, they are not constituted before that part of the body, (from whence
they are derived.) But the Umbilical Veins are conspicuous long before any
part of the Body is in hand.

What I have now delivered, has been ratified out of many dissections of
humane Embryo's of (almost) all sizes: for I have observed them from the
bigness of a Tad-pole, till they became of the longitude of seven or eight
fingers breadth, and so upwards to the Birth. And especially in the second,
third, and fourth months; at which times the greatest Alterations befall them,
and the progress of Generation is most evident.

Therefore, in a humane Embryo of two months old, those very things which we
have related in the second Process, do appear begun. For in the first month I
conceive there is little or nothing of the foetus extant in the womb; at least I
never found any thing. But that month expiring, I have frequently seen a
conception cast out (like to that which Hippocrates relates to have fallen from
the Minstrell) of the bigness of a Pheasants, or Pigeons egg, and it was of an
Oval figure, just like an Egg with the Shell pilled off; but the thicker
membrane (called Chorion) encompassing it, was plaistered on the out side, as
it were, with a mucous substance, (especially in the obtuser end) but within it
was slippery, being full of clear and stiff water, containing nothing else at
all.

In the second month, I have often seen such a kind of Egg (but larger)
ejected upon indications of Abortment, namely the Lochia ichorosa; and it has
been sometimes entire, and sometimes broken, covered over with clotted blood.
Within, it was smooth and slippery, the blood adhering without, and its form
was like the other. In some of these ejectments I have found a foetus, in
other, none. That foetus has been of the length of the nail of the little
finger, but the shape was like a little frog, save only that the head was
great, and the legs extremly short: just like the Tadpoles in June, which when
their limbs begin to shoot out, they loose their tail, and put on the shape of
Frogs. All its substance was white, and so soft and gellyish, that unless it
were cast into clear water, you could not hold it in your hand. The face was
like that of other Animals, as of a Dog, or Cat, without lips, and a wide mouth
from one care to the other.

Diverse Women, whose Conception (like an addle Egg) is fruitless, and without
a Foetus, do suffer abortion the third month. I have often dissected an
abortion of that age (being of the bigness of a Goose-egg) wherein was a
foetus, distinct in all its parts; though their form was rough, and unshapen,
The Head, Eyes, and Limbs appeared, but the Muscles were confused: having no
bones, but in their places, certain Lineaments, and softer Gristles, as it
were; the substance of the Heart was most white, having two Ventricles of equal
magnitude and thickness, and a double Cone, like two small Twin-kernels of a
Nut; the Liver was wondrous little, and also white. All this time, namely, for
three months space Vix quicquam Placentae, sive hepatis Uterini, scarce any
thing of the After-burden is to be seen.

In all these kind of Conceptions (as many as I have seen) I still found the
ambient membrane fraught with a vast quantity of watery substance: in which the
floating Embryo is so exceeding small, compared with the place where his abode
is, and has withal so long and winding a Navel; that those waters ought not
upon any terms to be thought the sweat, or Urine of the Embryo; but more
probably, his nutriment, provided by nature (like the Colliquamentum in the
Egg.) For I could find no indication to induce me to believe, that that
conception, or Egg had any connection to the Womb: only the outward
superficies of the obtuser end, looked something more wrinckled and thick; like
the first intention of a future placenta.

Moreover those Conceptions appeared to me, like certain eggs, which were
only to be harbored within the Womb, but to be nourished (like the
Henne-egge) by their own projection, or industry.

Now in the fourth month, you would admire how much the Foetus is improved;
for by this, it is increased from a Thumb-length to a Span: and all his members
appear distinct, and have a tincture of Blood; the Muscles of the Limbs, and
the Bones are now apparent; and also the Rudiments of the Nails; and the
Embryo begins to bestirre himself soundly. Yet the Head is still very big;
and the Face without Lips, Cheeks, or Nose: the chasm of the Mouth is very
large, whose space is half supplied by the Tongue; the Eyes small, and without
Lids; the middle part of the Forehead, and all the upper part of the Head is
covered with a Membrane, which is not as yet cartilaginous, so far is it from
being Boney: but the hinder part of the Head is something hard, and
Cartilaginous, implying that the Skull begins to grow solid.

The Genitals likewise did appear, but the Testicles were seated within the
Abdomen (where in females the Uterus resideth) the Scrotum remaining empty. The
Feminine parts were imperfect, and the Uterus with its little Tubuli, did
represent formam bicornem, the two horned shape of the Uterus of a Lamb.

And now the Placenta was enlarged, and affixed to the Womb; comprehending
almost half the Conception; appearing to my eye like a Tumor, or fleshey
excrescence of the Womb: its Gibbous part did stick so fast, even throughout
its whole extent, to the Womb, which was now grown thicker. Into this Placenta
the little Umbilical branches (like slender roots into the Earth) did insinuate
themselves: and by its mediation the Conception was now first tied to the Womb.

The large and fluid Brain resembled Cheese-Curd, and was embroidered with
larger Veins. The two Ventricles of the Heart, both of the same magnitude, and
their walls equally thick. In the Region of the Breast within the Ribs, I saw
three hollow places, and those not much unlike each other: the lowest of which,
the Lungs having Blood in them, and of like complexion with the Liver and
Kidneys, did inhabit: the middle was possessed by the Heart and Pericardium:
but the upper was filled with that large Glandule which we call Thymus, the
Sweetbread.

In the Stomach was Chyle, of like substance to that in which the Embryo swims:
There was also a coagulated substance which was white, like to those white
curded pollutions which the Midwife washes off from the Infant (especially
from the foulds of the Skin) so soon as it is borne. In the superior
Intestines was Excrement, or some part of the Chyle, in the inferior a little
dark excrement. In the Bladder was Urine found: and Gall in the Vesicle
designed for its reception. Intestinum Cacum, the blind Gut (just as it is in
grown persons) like an empty superfluous appendix of the Colon; and nothing
like what it is in other Animals, (as the Hog, the Horse, and the Hare) in
which it is like a Second Stomach. The Omentum, or Kell, did like a Caul, or
thin transparent cloud, lie floating upon the Guts.

The Reins at this time are not formed into a gibbous figure, as it is when
men are grown, but are molded of several gobbets (as you see in a Calfe, and
in a Sturgeon) as if to every sprig or divarication of the Ureters, there were
a gobbet or Teat, out of which their Orifices did draine the Urine. Upon the
Kidneys there are the two Glandules (which Eustachius first found out) wherein
store of blood lies; and their Vein, which Anatomist call Adipose, seems not
much less then the Emulgent it self. The Liver, and Spleen, are equally full of
blood (according to their several proportions.)

And here we must observe by the way, that in every Humane Foetus that is
lively and well, perfect Milk is found; wherewith chiefly the Glandule Thymus,
or the Sweetbread is stored. It is also found in the Pancreas, and almost all
along the Mesentery, in certain Venae Lacteae as it were, and the Glandules
placed between the divarications of the Meseraicke Veins. Nay sometimes it may
be milked out at the breasts of Newborn Infants, and sometimes also it starts
out of it self: which some Midwives say, does make for the Infants Health.

And that it may plainly appear, that the water (which is so plenteous in the
Conception) is no excrement discharged by the Embryo, as either his Sweat, or
Urine; it is less (in proportion) near the birth (when the foetus is now more
grown, and upon that account does accumulate more excrement, because he
requires more nourishment) then in the first months of pregnation. And
moreover, at that time his bladder is full, and distended with Urine. And to
say truth, that passage, (which Anatomists call the Urachus) which should (as
they fancy) convey the Urine from the bladder, through the Navel, could never
yet be found out: but I have often seen the bladder, pressed or griped with the
hand, discharge the Urine out at the Yard, but never at the Urachus.

And let this suffice, concerning what we have observed in a humane Foetus, so
far forth as it relates to the knowledge of the Order of the Parts.

In the Fourth and last Process, the parts of meaner rank and condition are
formed: such as do not simply relate to the very being, and preservation of the
Animal, but only ad tutelam, to its safeguard against foreign injuries: or
ad ornatum, vel pugnam, to its Ornament, or for Defense.

For that kind of Safeguard or Defense, the utmost part (namely the Skin) is
chiefly constituted, and all that proceeds out of it, as the Scarfeskin, the
Hair, Wool, Plumes, Scales, Shells, Clans, Hoofs, and the like. And indeed it
is a prudent contrivance of Nature (who never makes any thing indiscreetly,) to
beget those parts last of all, whereof she has no use till after nativity. And
therefore the Chicken is borne with down only on him, and not Feathers (as
other Birds are, who are presently fitted for flight) because by wandering to
and fro, he earns his sustenance with the industry of his Legs, rather then his
Wings: And so again young Ducklins, and Goslins, who prey in the water, have
their Plumes, and Wings later perfected then their Legs: which is clean
contrary in young Swallows, which, because they are to fly about to glean up a
living, are sooner versed in flight, then walking.

Now the Down starts up in the Chicken after the Fourteenth day, when the
Foetus is now complete, and provided with all his parts. But in many of them,
at their first nativity, it looks like dark spots or points; and after that
the Feathers sprout up like Grass in the Field, and at last expatiate, and
cloth the body round, protecting it from the inclemency of the Air.

The Feathers differ from Quills, in form, use, and place of Production. For
Chickens are Feathered ere they have Quills: for Quills spring only in their
Wings, and Rump; and stick deeper in the bottom of the flesh, or the very
Periostium it self, and are useful to motion: but the Feathers rise out of the
superficies of the Skinn, and serve for protection.

Nails, Hair, Horns, and the like, says Aristotle, De genesis an. l. 2. c. 4.
are bred out of the Flesh, in so much that they change color with the Flesh:
for the white, and black, and diverse colored, are made so, according to the
different complexion of the Skin. But in our Chicken, all this is clean
otherwise, for what various color soever the Feathers be of, the Skin beneath
them is of one only. And many times one and the same Feather is diversely
painted and discolored, for the pomp and beauty of the Foul.

Likewise in the Humane Foetus, the Cutis and all the skinny parts are last
perfected. And therefore at the beginning, there are neither Lips, nor Cheeks,
nor Ears, nor Eyelids, nor Nose to be seen: and that line whereby the upper-lip
is united into one, does close the last of all.

The Humane production is also borne naked and unarmed; as one whom Nature had
intended for a sociable, political, and peaceable creature: and to be ruled
more by reason, then constrained by force. And therefore she has furnished him
with Hands, and Understanding, that having provided properties, he might
cloth, and defend himself. For those Animals whom Nature has made strong, she
has also armed with weapons agreeable to their strength: but where she has
denied strength, she has bestowed wit, and cunning, and an admirable dexterity
to evade affronts.

The Ornaments, as the Tuft upon the Head, the Comb, the Gills and the like,
wherewith the haughty Animals swagger, are for the most part imparted to the
male, more then the female: as also all weapons too, as Teeth, Horns, and
Spurs, etc. which appoints them for the Battle. And they are then compleatest
in the male, about that time when the female is in her prime, and provoked to
leave an Heir behind her. For they are yet to come in the younger Animals, and
in the aged they wither, and decline (as useless.)

Our Dunghil-Cock (that famous Champion) so soon as he is strong, and ripe for
generation, is provided of his Spurs, Comb, and Plumes; by which he becomes
amiable in the fight of his Concubines: and combats other Cocks not from any
vain Itch of Ostentation, but to perpetuate his own Lineage, that so he that is
best able to protect himself and his Charge, may have the prerogative to
propagate the Species. For all those Animals which are well appointed with
arms, and more Martial creatures then the rest, do ground their quarrels,
either upon the Rescue of their Young, or their title to their habitations, or
their husbandry for their provisions, but in chief, upon Rivalship in their
Loves (and that, for posterities sake) and being subdued, as they lay by their
pomp, and disdainful demeanor, so they surrender their claim to their Wives;
and with dejected spirits languish out their days; while the Victor fleshed
with the conquest, riots in the enjoyment of the Captives Females.

Nor is this their bravery any ascititious Wardrobe, or some few days
Pageantry, or Masquingstuff, but a lasting one, and Natures liberal Dowry,
which delights not only in the Embroidery of Animals (and chiefly of Birds)
but has employed her Pencil upon Flowers, and Plants, adorning them with
wonderful Art and variety of colors.

Certain Paradoxes, and Problemes to be considered of, concerning this Subject.
EXEECIT. LVII.
THus far have we spoken concerning the Order of Generation: by which the
difference between those creatures which are produced by a Metamorphosis, and
those which are borne by an Epigenesis, has been discovered: as also, between
those that spring from a Worm, and those that arise from an Egg: for these
are bodied out of one part of the prepared matter, and fed with the other; But
they take up the whole matter in their frame, or Constitution: these are
together augmented and formed; they are augmented first, and from a
Canker-Worme grow into an Aurelia, and are afterward formed and made
consummate Animals, as Butterflies, Silk-wormes, and such like Animals.

And therefore Aristotle (as Fabricius observes) as he constitutes a kind of
twofold nature of the egg, and a kind of twofold Egg in these creatures; so
he lays down a twofold action, and a twofold Animal produced by it. For (says
he) out of the first eggs, which are the first rudiments of the Generation, a
Worm constantly does proceed: namely, out of the Eggs of Files, Ants, Bees,
Silk-wormes, etc. in which a certain fluid matter is contained, and out of all
that fluid matter is the Worm made. But out of the second Eggs, which are
laid by the Worm himself, the Butterfly is born, and proceeds; that is, a
Volatile Animal, which is concluded in a kind of Shell, Skin, little bag, or
egg, and when that bag is broken it departs thence as Aristotle delivers
concerning the Locusts eggs. Lastly these are perfected by a succession of
parts; but they (namely, such as are generated by a Metamorphosis) are made
entire at once. And in the same manner, are both Spontaneous productions
generated, which obtain their first matter, and first extraction from
putrefaction, filth, dew, excrements, or out of the parts of Plants, or
Animals; as also those issues which proceed from the seed of Univocal Animals.
For it is common to all Animals, to desume their Original from seed, or an
egg: whether that seed proceed from other Animals of the same species, or
happen there casually from some thing else. For as it sometimes befalls in Art,
so also in Nature; namely, that the same things are sometimes casual, which at
other times are effected by Art: as Aristotle does instance in Health, so in
like manner is the Generation of any Animals; (as far as they proceed from
Seed) whether their seed be casual, or else proceed from an Univocal Agent of
the same kind. For even in casual seed, there is a motive principle of
Generation, which can generate out of it self, and by it self: and the same
thing is found in it, as in Univocal Animals; namely, a power to form a living
creature. But of this more at large hereafter.

Now some Paradoxes do here arise to be examined. For since the Macula is
dilated, the Colliquamentum concocted, and prepared, and many other things (not
without great providence) ordered, toward the formation, and growth of the
Chicken, before any particle of the Chicken appear; what should hinder the
Innate beat, and vegetative soul of the Chicken to be existent before the
Chicken it self? For what can produce the effects and operations of Life, but
that which is the cause and efficient of those Effects and Operations; namely,
the heat, and faculty of the Vegetal soul? And therefore the soul does not seem
to be Actus corporis Organici vitam habentis in potentia, the Act of an
Organical body, which has life in it in potentia: for we conceive the form of
the Chicken to be such an Act. Now in what can we imagine the form, or soul of
the Chicken to be, but in the Chicken it self? unless we allow the forms to be
separate, or grant a Metempsychosis.

But this is most manifest, where the same Animal lives by a succession of
forms; (as Aristotle speaks) as for example, Out of a Canker-worm, an Aurelia,
and then a Butterfly. For the same Efficient, Nutritive, and Preserving
principle, must needs be in each of these: unless we will place one soul in the
Boy, another in the Young man, and a third in the Old: or affirm, that the
Canker-worm, and that worm which becomes a Silkworm, also the Silkworm, and
the Butterfly, have the same form, of which matter Aristotle has accurately
written, and whereof more largely hereafter.

Again, it seems a Paradox, that the blood should be made, and move, and be
endowed with Vital spirits, before any sanguifying, or Motive Organs are
constituted at all.

Nor is it less new and unheard of, that there should be Sense and Motion in
the Foetus, before his brain is made; for the Foetus moves, contracts, and
extends himself, when there is nothing yet appears for a brain, but clear water.

Besides, the body is nourished and increased, before the Organs dedicated to
Concoction (namely the Stomach and Liver) are formed. And likewise
Sanguification (which is the second Concoction) is performed before the first,
(which is by the Stomach) and called Chylification.

The Excrements of the first and second Concoction (namely in the Guts, and the
two bladders, of Urine one, the other of Gall) are coetaneous to the concocting
Instruments themselves. Lastly, there is a Mind, Providence, and
Understanding, not only in the Vegetal part of the soul, but even before the
soul it self; procuring, disposing, and ordering all things, and artificially
molding the future foetus to a resemblance with his parents, even from the very
first original; and all this, to advance the being, and well being of the
Foetus.

Concerning which Resemblance, we may enquire, what should be the cause why the
Foetus sometimes resembles the Father, sometimes the Mother, and sometimes also
the Progenitors, and those either of the Father or Mothers side? And this the
rather, since upon one single coition, and at the same moment of time, many
Eggs are fructified together. This also is a wonderful thing, that the
Virtues, and Vices, the Diseases, the Marks, the Moles or Spots should be
transferred to Posterity: and that into some only of the Progeny, and not unto
all. In the race of Cocks, some are of a generous spirit, and born to battle;
who will dye rather then turn their backs upon their Adversaries: and yet their
Nephews, unless they proceed of like parents, do by degrees forfeit their
galantry; according to that saying, Fortes creantur fortibus. In many other
Animals (and especially in Man) the Bravery of the Succession, or Family is
observable: and many of the Indowments both of body and soul are derived down
to it ex traduce.

This I have often admired, that when the Issue has obtained a mixed fabric or
composition from both Parents, and that in all other parts of the body, yet it
has not been so in the Genitals; but that it commonly proves either Male, or
Female, and very seldom an Hermaphrodite.

Lastly, many things are in the foetus ere they appear at all; and some things
are begun with the first, but perfected with the last: as the Eyes, Genitals,
and Bill.

And hence there arise debates concerning the pre-eminence, or dignity of the
Parts; in which the Wits of such as are curious in these cases, may employ
themselves. As, Whether the Heart bestow life and vigor upon the blood, or the
blood rather upon the Heart? Whether the blood be made for the bodies sake, as
the Matter, Nutriment, and Instrument; or else the body, and all its parts for
the blood, and the soul which does first and principally reside in it?
Likewise, Whether the Ventricles, or Auricles of the Heart are most honorable?
For we find that the Auricles have life and pulse first, and do expire last.
And farther, Whether the left Ventricle of the Heart, which is deeper in a Man,
and is fenced with a thicker and more carnous wall, and is conceived to be the
fountain of the Spirts, be the more excellent, hotter, more fraught with
Spirits, and livelyer of the two: or the Right, which does last languish and
subscribe to Death, containing a large quantity of blood: and where the Dying
man's blood does last congeal, and is deprived of life and spirit? and whether
also the Umbilical Vessels do transport the blood (as to their fountain) and
whence also they derive their extraction?

Now these things do result out of the Observation of the Order of the
Generation of the Parts, as also other things which may be hence deduced, and
do not a little clash against the Physiology commonly approved. Namely, (when we
plainly see that there is both Sense and Motion, before the brain is begotten)
it is evident that all Sense and Motion is not derived from the brain: for it
appears by our History, that Sense and Motion do clearly discover themselves
in the first small drop of blood in the Egg, before any particle of the body
is framed. And likewise, the first platform or constitution (which we call
gelly) is laid before any part is discerned; and when the brain is now nothing
but a clear water: which first rudiment of the Body, if it be lightly pricked,
will, like a Worm or Magot, obscurely move, and contract it self: which is a
plain testimony of its sense.

There are also other Arguments deduced from Sense and Motion, by which we may
conclude (with Aristotle) That the Heart, and not (with Physicians) that the
Brain is the first Principle.

Those Motions and Actions, which Physicians call Natural, because they proceed
whether we will or no; and we cannot moderate, accelerate, retard, or refrain
them at our own pleasure: and which therefore are Independent in regard of the
brain; yet even they are not performed without all sense, but do imply sense,
as by which they are excited, provoked, and altered. For we conceive, that in
the Heart it self, its Palpitation, Trembling, Fainting, Sowning, and all the
changes in the pulse, either in magnitude, celerity, order, rhythme, or the
like, do proceed from morbifical causes indisposing it, and offensive to its
sense. For whatsoever by diversity of motions makes war against those things
that enrage and molest it, must needs be endowed with sense.

The Stomach and Guts provoked by injurious humors, do raise a Nauseating,
Belching, Rumbling, Vomiting, and Flux; and as it is beyond our power, either
to raise or lay these combustions, so are we to seek for any such sense
retaining to the brain, which should excite those parts to such Expressions.

It is very strange, that upon the Infusion of Antimony taken in a Vomit,
though we neither distinguish it by taste, nor find any disgust in it, either
swallowing it down, or in returning it back again; yet there passes a censure
upon it by the Stomach, which discerns between what is useful and prejudicial,
and so provokes to Vomit.

Nay, the Flesh it self does easily distinguish a poisonous wound from one that
is not poisonous; and thereupon contracts it self, and condenseth; upon which
enflamed tumors arise: as we may see in the stingings of the Be, the Gnat,
and the Spider.

I my self once, for experiment sake, pricked my hand with a needle; and
presently rubbing the same needle upon a Spiders tooth, I pricked my hand in
another place, so that I my self could not distinguish between the two pricks.
But there was something in my Skin that did distinguish; for in that place
where the poisoned prick fell, it presently contracted it self into a pimple,
and presently grew red, hot, and inflamed; as if it fortified it self, and
stood upon its guard, to oppose, and subdue the malice of the Venom.

The Offenses undergone by the Matrix, as its Contorsion, Descension, Falling
down, Rising, Suffocation, and other Maladies and Provocations, do no whit
depend upon the Brain, or Common sense; nor yet can they be conceived to befall
it insensibly. For that which is plainly void of Sense, cannot seem any way to
be porovked, or heightened into any motion, or action. Nor have we any other
signs to distinguish an animate and sensitive creature, from a dead and
senseless one, then by its motion provoked from some offensive object, which
does always follow, and argue Sense.

But of this more at large, when we treat of the Actions and Use of the Brain.
But the Reverence due to the Ancients, and Antiquity her self, does advise us
to uphold their doctrines, so far as they are true. Nor can it beseem us
rashly to reject, and discountenance their Labors, and Decrees, whose light
has been our direction to the Shrines of Philosophy; wherefore I conceive we
ought to think thus. We perceive we have Five Senses, by which we give
judgment upon outward things; but because it is not the same sense, by which
we perceive, and by which we perceive our own perception; (for we see with our
Eyes, but we do not by them know we see) but by another sense, which employes
another sensitive Organ (namely, the Internal Common sense) by which we give
judgment upon all those things which we perceive by our external Organs, and
so distinguish white from sweet, and hard: This common Sensorium, or Organ of
Sense (whither all Species are conveyed from the outward Organs) is plainly the
Head; which, together with all his Nerves, and outward Organs adjoined to them,
is understood to be the adequate Organ of Sensation. And it is like the
Sensitive Root, from which several Fibers result; whereof one sees, another
hears, a third touches, and the other smell, and taste.

Yet as there are certain Actions and Motions, whose Regiment or Jurisdiction
relates not to the Brain, and they therefore are called Natural: so also must
we conclude, that there is a certain sense of Touching, which is not conveyed
to the Common sense, or any way communicated to the brain; and therefore in
that kind of sense, we do not perceive our sensation: but just like men whose
understanding is perverted, or else are distracted by some violent Passion,
insomuch that they are insensible of all pain, and takes no notice of any thing
that meets their senses: So we must conceive it to be in this sense, which we
therefore distinguish from Animal sense. Having observed such a kind of sense
in the Zoophyta, or Plant-Animals (as the Sensitive Plant, Sponges, and the
like.)

Wherefore, as many Animals have both Sense and Motion, without the Common
sense, or a brain; as the Worms in the Guts, also those Worms which turn into
Silkworms, and the like, so also do some actions befall the Embryo, and us
also without any assistance from the brain, and a kind of sensation does
proceed, without sense. And as Physicians teach, that Natural Actions differ
from Animal; so upon like reason, the Natural Touch seems to differ from the
Animal sense of Touching, and constitute a distinct species of Feeling: so that
the one is communicated to the Common sense, or brain, and the other not.

Moreover, it is one thing for a Muscle to be moved or contracted, and another
thing for it to perform an Action, at distinct regulated contractions and
relaxations; as to go forward, or receive any thing in the hands. Doubtless,
the Muscles, or Motory Organs, in the Cynical distortion, or Convulsion
proceeding from some cause that disturbs them, are no otherwise moved, then a
Cock or Hen, which when the Head is quite chopped off, is disturbed with many
convulsive motions of the Legs and Wings: but such as are altogether confused,
and disordered, because the sway of the brain is dethroned, and the common
sense deposed, under whose Government formerly, those motions were regulated by
rhythm and harmony, either to walking, or flight.

We conceive therefore, that it ought to be said, That all Natural Motions
proceed from the power of the Heart, and are as his Retinue: but the
Spontaneous, and such as perfect any Action, (which Physicians call animal) are
not produced but by the brain and common sense controuling them. For as by this
common sense, we perceive our own Sensation, so also we perceive our own
motion; and that whether it be regular, or perverse.

We have a clear Instance of both these motions in Respiration; for the Lungs
(as the Heart) are continually moved up and down by a natural motion, and also
provoked to cough, and frequent Agitation; but produce or shape a voice, or
sing they cannot, without help, and commission from common sense.

But these things are to be more fully handled, when we shall fix our
contemplation upon the Action and Use of the Brain, and the Consideration of
the Soul. But thus much has been delivered by the way, that we may delare our
desire and inclination to pay our Masters the respect we owe them.

Of the Nutrition of the Chicken in the Egg.
EXERCIT. LVIII.
HOw much the Authority of the Ancients is not rashly to be rejected, appears
even in this: It was of old an opinion much prized (which yet many at this day
disclame as erroneous; and Fabricius decryes it as a mere delusion, and fond
persuasion) that the Embryo did suck, in its mothers De form. foet. p. 19. or
134. l. de carn. and de not. puer.
Womb: and it had Democritus, Epicurus, and Hippocrates himself for its
Abbettors. And Hippocrates does establish his opinion chiefly upon two
arguments; For, says he, unless it had sucked, how could it deposit any
excrements: or know how to suck so soon as it is born.

Now in other cases they use to subscribe to every word pronounced by this so
famous, and ancient Oracle, and his (...) was warrant enough: but here (because
he delivers things dissonant to what is commonly received, Fabricius does not
only renounce his bare assertion, but stands out in defiance against his
proofs. Therefore I appeal to the judgment of the most skilful Anatomists,
and most learned Physicians, whether our Observations concerning the Generation
of Animals, do not only cast a probability, but enforce the necessity of this
opinion of Hippocrates.

All in general acknowledge, that the Foetus while he abides in the Womb does
wallow in abundance of Water, (which Liquor, we, in the History of the Egg,
style the Colliquamentum, and the Moderns say that Water is the Sweat and Urine
of the Foetus; affording this advantage, that the Foetus floating in it (while
the Mother runs, leaps, or uses any other violent motion) does not easily
offend the Womb, nor is himself wronged by allision against the bones seated
there round about him, or some outward blows; and the rather, for that at this
time, his body is but tender, and infirm.

Fabricius adjoines other benefits arising from page 137.
these Waters; namely, Their moistning and lubrifying all the passages round
about, and rendering the neck of the Matrix capable of the largest dilatation;
and all these commodities, says he, do no less arise from that thick white
Excrement, answerable to that of the third concoction, which is Unciuous, Oily,
and Fat, and neglected by the Ancients. Which it also performs, least the
Sweat which may sometimes transpire, sharp, and saltish, should erode the
tender Infants body.

I willingly acknowledge the several benefits assigned to this water, by all
Writers; namely, that the tender Foetus in order to his indemnity from any
sudden, and violent motions of his Mother, is thus securely nestled in alis
vespertilionum, in the Bats Wings, as they call them, and moated round with
store of water, so that he cannot easily, by every (though violent) motion dash
himself against his Mothers sides; (because of those ties which fasten him on
every side) at least this circumambient liquor being equally poised in the
midst does protect him from all outward harm. But my own Observations, as they
do in many other matters, so also in this enforce me to be of a contrary
opinion to Fabricius: for I am most certain, that the said liquor, is not the
Sweat of the Foetus. Nor can I believe, that that water does perform those
offices in the birth, which he commemorates: and much less, that it is so
sharp and Briney, that the foetus must stand in need of an oily unctuous fence
to secure him from it, especially that foetus, which is either clothed with
Wool, Hair, or Feathers. For this liquor is of a good savor, and like a kind
of watery Milk; and therefore, almost all Viviparous Animals, so soon as they
have brought their Young into the world, fall abord and eat it up, and lick
their new born issues clean, greedily swallowing the humor which they receive
in, when they will not so much as touch the excrements of their foetus.

Fabricius conceived this water to be sharp, and salt, because he thought it to
be the sweat. But what injury, I pray, can the sweat do to the foetus now
clothed in feathers? if at least he ever saw such a creature as a sweating
Chicken.

And I suppose he will not say, that the use of that water in an egg, is by
its moisture and lubricity to expedite the Chickens birth. For the dryer and
older the shell is, by so much the frailer, and britler it becomes. Lastly,
were it the Chickens sweat, it would most abound near the Exclusion; for the
larger the Chicken is, and the more Aliment he takes in, so much the more sweat
must he necessarily create. But a little before his Exclusion (about the
ninteenth or twentieth day) there is none of this kind of humor discernable;
whereby, he should have rather reputed it an Aliment, then an Excrement: (had
he rightly considered the matter) especially, seeing he allows the Chicken in
the Egg, the use of Respiration, Voice, and Crying, which, were he begirt with
water, could not have been.

Nor are these Waters of any great use, to the Expedition, or Lubricity of the
Delivery (as experienced Midwives know full well) though Fabricius would have
it otherwise. For the neighbor Parts are about that time, (without any
profusion of those Waters, mellow and relaxed by a certain maturity of their
own: especially, those which may be an obstruction to the work: namely, the
Ossa pubis, and Coccygis; about which the chiefest care of the Midwife is
exercised in furthering the delivery: for she is less solicitous, to anoint the
fleshey parts, least they rend in sunder, then in putting back the Coccyx;
which if she cannot effect with her own hand, she calls in the Man-Midwife to
procure her purpose by the Speculum matricis; which instrument by its triple
sides, whereof one is applied to the Coccyx, the other two to the Ossa pubis,
does distend those parts by force.

For the Infant now just at his Birth, while he turns himself, and
precipitates his Head downward, does relax and open the orifice of the Womb:
but if in his descent he light upon the top of the Bone, there he sticks; and
hardly gets forth, and that not without danger, to himself, and his Mother too.
Now it is evidently natures intent, to mollify and relax those parts. For, if
the Midwife do discover the Orifice of the Matrix become soft and loose, she
lays it down for an infallible sign of the approaching delivery, though the
Waters are not yet broken. Nay (I speak what I know by Experience) in case any
thing remain after the delivery, which ought to be discharged, or if at any
other time there be any thing in the Womb, which it endeavors to be rid of,
the Orifice does not only descend, but is also soft and relaxed: but if after
the delivery, that Orifice be retired into its place, and be perceived to be
grown something hard, it is an evident sign that all is well.

And by the like Experience, I pronounce, the Ossa pubis to be often loosened
one from another in delivery, their cartilaginous connection being mollified,
and all the Region of the Lower Belly miraculously dilated; and this not by the
profusion of the Watery substance, but of their own accord, as ripe fruits use
to revolt or open, to make room for the Exclusion of their seeds. But how much
the Coccyx may retard the delivery, is clear in fourfooted beasts, that have
Tails; for they can neither bring forth young, nor disload the excrements of
the Guts, unless they remove their Tail; which if you depress with your hand,
you hinder the passage of the Excrement.

Moreover, that is accounted the most Natural Delivery, when the Foetus and
Secundines with the Watery substance (that is, the Entire Egg) get forth
together. For if the Secundines be entire, and the waters not broken, the
circumjacent parts are more distended, and dilated by the Throws, namely, by
the distention of the Membranes, whereupon, the foetus works his release with
less struggling; though the Mothers pains be the greater. In which condition,
we know how the Woman in Labor is much relieved from the intolerable torment
caused by distention, upon the breaking of the Membranes, (whether it be done
by Midwives nails, or by a pair of Scissors) the Waters by that means being
set a float.

And the skilful Midwives know very well, that in case all the Waters be come
away, before the natural opening of the Womb, the Woman with Child, continues
the longer in Labor, and her Travail is the harder; which would yet be
contrary, in case those precedent Waters (as Fabricius would have it) did so
much conduce to the mollifying, and Lubricity of the parts.

Besides that this humor, which we call the Colliquamentum, is not the sweat
of the foetus, is evident, both in the Egg and other Animals; for it is in
being, before any part of the foetus is constituted, or any rudiment of him
extant. Nay so soon as he is discernable, and is yet but gelly, and very small,
so great a quantity of Water is to be seen, that it is utterly impossible, so
inconsiderable a bulk should afford such plenty of Excrement.

Add to this, that the fibers of the Umbilical vessels are scattered and
terminated in the membrane containing this Water, as in the Yolk and White of
the Egg: to give evidence clearly (if you consider the thing, as it truly is)
that this humor, is rather to be conceived the Aliment, then the Excrement.

Wherefore Hippocrates his opinion seems to me more probable then that of
Fabricius, and other Anatomists, who count this Liquor the Sweat, and Prejudice
of the foetus. For I believe that this Colliquamentum, or Water wherein the
foetus swims, does serve for his sustenance; and that the thinner and purer
part of it, being imbibed by the Umbilical Vessels, do constitute and supply
the primogenit parts: and the rest, like Milk, being by suction conveyed into
the Stomach and there concocted or chylified, and afterward attracted by the
Orifices of the Meseraick Veins, does nourish and enlarge the tender Embryo.
And to fortify my persuasion, I shall lay down some arguments, that prevail
with me.

So soon as the foetus attains any perfection, he presently stirs his Limbs,
and proceeds to make trial of those actions, to which his Instruments of motion
are designed. Now we see the Chicken in the Egg, open his mouth amidst this
Water; whereby he must needs swallow it down. For it is most certain, that
whatsoever is gone beyond the root of the Tongue, and is arrived at the top of
the Gullet, no creature can return (but by Vomition) whereupon the Farriers,
which administer medicinal Potions, Boles, or Pills, to Cattle, taking them by
the tongue cast it in beyond the protuberance of the Tongue, just at the Root,
that so they cannot avoid the swallowing. And if any of us, convey a Pill so
far as the root of the tongue, he shall find himself necessitated to swallow it
down, unless a Vomit meet, and repel it. Wherefore since the Embryo wallowing
in the foresaid liquor, does open his mouth; it follows likewise that it must
enter in; and since he moves his other muscles, why should we doubt, but that
he imployes the Instrument of his throat likewise, and so imbibes the humor.

Moreover it is certain, that in the Craw of the Chicken (and the like is also
found in the Stomach of all Embryo's) there is seen a substance most like in
color, taste, and consistence to the said liquor; which being a while digested
in the Stomach, resembles coagulated Milk; and we have also found it like to
Chyle, in the upper Gut, the lower Guts being then stuffed with Excrements.

So also in the foetus of Viviparous creatures, the thicker Guts are full of
such an Excrement as that, wherewith they do abound all the while they are sed
with Milk. Also in Sheep and other beasts which divide the Hoof, the dried dung
is manifestly to be seen.

About the seventeenth day, I have evidently found excrement in a Chicken, near
the fundament; and have also seen it, when it has been discharged into the
Secundines, a little before the exclusion. And Volcherus Coiter, a diligent and
skilful Anatomist, records the same observation. Why then should we scruple to
say, that the foetus in the Womb does suck; and that a Chyle is made there;
when we have both the apparent principle, and rejectments of it.

Besides, at that time when we see both the bladders, one full of Gall, and the
other of Urine (both which are excrements of the second concoction) why may we
not conclude that Chylifaction, which is the first concoction, went before it.

The Embryo therefore sucks, and receives nutriment in at the Mouth. And this
you shall soon discry, if so soon as ever he is borne, you put your finger into
his mouth. Which according to Hippocrates, would not be, had he not sucked
before in the Womb. For we see young Children make essays, and attempt upon all
performances: namely, moving their Limbs, crawling along, and endeavoring to
speak: all which they attain at last with dexterity, by long practice, and
education. But so soon as ever they are born, nay before they are born, they
will suck. For we have found by experience, that while they yet stick fast in
the Birth, before they can either cry or breath, they will seize upon the
finger extended to them, and suck it.

Nay, A Newborn Child is more exact at sucking, then a grown body, or himself
either if he discontinue it but a few days. For the Infant does not compress
the Nipple, and suck at the rate that we do by gulping down: but as if he would
devour the Nipple, he still draws it into his mouth, and by the aid of his
tongue, and palate, he sucks the milk, as if he chewed it; with far more
earnestness, and slight, then a grown body. Wherefore he seems to be good at it
of old, and to have practiced it in the womb; for we see how soon he unlearns
it by discontinuance.

By these and other Observations it is probable, that the Chicken is fed two
ways in the Egg, namely, both by the Umbilical, and the Meseraick Veiues: by
the former, he attracts well digested aliment, whereby the Blood, and
primogenit parts are constituted, and increased; by the other, Chyle, which
conduces to the fabric, and augmentation of the other parts.

Now, perhaps the reason may seem obscure, wherefore the same Agent should out
of the same Matter proceed to a diverse manner of Nutrition: (when Nature does
nothing in vain) yet we will endeavor to discover the reason.

That Part which is attracted by the Umbilical Veins, is the purer and
sincerer part: But the remaining Colliquamentum wherein the Foetus floats, is a
kind of crude milk, without cream, deprived of its purer part. The more pure
part therefore stands in no need of farther concoction, as the other does,
which therefore is received into the Stomach, and there chylified. The thin,
and crude milk, such as is found in the breast presently after delivery, is
like this. For the dissolved White of an Egg, and the crude and watery milk in
the breast or udder, are of the self same color, taste, and consistence. Also
the first milk given, is serous, and watery; and Women in Childe-bed do milk a
kind of water out of their breasts, before the milk is concocted, and
perfectly white.

And therefore the Colliquamentum found in the Chickens crop is a kind of
crude Milk; and the very same afterward found in the Gisard, is concocted,
white, and coagulated. So likewise in Viviparous Animals, before their milk is
digested in their breast, it looks like a kind of Dew, or Colliquamentum; and
so on the contrary, the Colliquamentum, after it is concocted in the Stomach,
puts on the likeness of Milk. Whence it comes to pass, according to Aristotle's
opinion, that the first and most principal parts are fashioned out of the finer
and purer materials: but of the courser, (by a new concoction in the Stomach)
refined, the meaner and inferior sort of parts are made: so that Nature like a
kind, indulgent mother, would rather abound with Supernumeraries, then be
scanted in Necessaries. Or rather, we must affirm it consonant to reason, that
the foetus now grown more perfect in himself, should also be sustained after a
more perfect manner (viz. by the Mouth) and attract his aliment more refined,
and rendered more devoid of dreggs, by the two precedent Concoctions; (As being
thereby cleansed from two several sorts of Excrements.) At first, indeed, being
sustained by the Umbilical Vessels, he lives like a Plant supplied by its root;
and hereupon his body looks indigested, white, and imperfect; and like a Plant,
he remains fixed, and immovable. But so soon as he enjoyes the same aliment
more elaborate, as now inspired with a diviner spirit, and triumphing in a
higher pitch of Vegetation, the former Gelly is transformed into flesh, the
Organs of motion are distinct, the spirits are enricht, and he himself begins
to move: and now no longer is cherished like a Plant by his roots, but lives
the life of an Animal, and is nourished at the Mouth.

Of the Uses of the whole Egg.
EXER: LIX.
HAving declared those mutations, and several proceedings, which are required
in a Hen-egg, in order to the production of the Chicken; Fabricius proceeds to
discourse of the uses of the whole Egg, and of its Parts: and this not only
in a Hen-egge, but in all other kinds of Eggs. Where he also demands, Why some
Eggs are heterogeneous, and compounded of diverse parts; and others are
homogeneous, and similar? such as the Eggs of Insects are, and of those
creatures, which are constituted out of the whole Egg, (by a Metamorphosis)
and not generated out of one part of the egg, and nourished by the other, as
the Chicken is.

But my business is not to treat of all Eggs in general (as not having in this
Tract delivered their history) but only of Hen-eggs, and the benefits or
advantages arising from their parts: all which ought to tend to that, to which
the Action of the whole is directed; which Fabricius truly observes, page 50.
to be nothing else but the Generation and Augmentation of the Chicken.

And amongst those things which relate to the Whole Egg, Fabricius does
recount the Figure, Quantity, and Number of the Eggs. The Figure of the Egg,
says he, is round, that the whole bulk of the Chicken might be contained in
the lesser space; for l. 10. de us. Part.
which cause God made the Universe Round, to comprehend all things: and for the
same cause, this Figure, says Galen, appeared always most lovely, and
convenient to Nature. Besides, in that it has no angle exposed to outward
injuries; it is therefore esteemed the safest figure, and most convenient for
the Exclusion of the Chicken. Now Fabricius upon this ground, ought to have
assigned the reason, why Hen-egges are not spherical (as the fry, or eggs of
fishes, worms, and froggs are) but acuminated and oblong. What impediment is
there which hinders them from this perfect figure? Therefore, in my judgment,
the figure of the egg has no influence at all upon the Generation of the
Chicken, but is merely accidental; which I the rather conceive, because there
are so many several varieties of figures, even in the Hen-eggs only. For the
figure differs according to the diversity of the Uterus, in which (as in a
Mould) it receives its form.

Aristotle, indeed, says, That oblong eggs produce Hist. an. l. 6. c. 2.
Hens, but the rounder, Cocks: But I have never yet observed any such thing.
And Pliny affirms the clean contrary: The rounder sort of eggs, says he, l.
10. c. 52.
exclude Hens, and the rest, Cocks. And, to say truth, if there were any
certainty to be collected hence, some Hens would ever generate Cocks, and
other, Hens: for some do lay eggs which are always of one and the same figure,
that is, ever oblong, or ever round. And the oblong would rather exclude Plin.
ibid.
Cocks, because they are the more perfect, and better concocted; and therefore
Horace esteemed them to be more pleasant then the round.

The Reasons alleged by Fabricius for the figures of the Eggs, we willingly
pass by, because they are invalid.

As for the Magnitude of the Egg, that indeed does seem to conduce to the
largeness of the fatus, which is thence to be generated; for your great Hens
lay fairer eggs. And yet the Crocodile lays eggs no bigger then Goose-eggs:
no living creature Id. l. 8. c. 25
spreading into so large a bulk from so small an Original. It is also probable,
that the largeness of the Egg, and the plenty of the liquours contained in it,
do conduce something to the fecundity of the Egg: for the very small eggs
(called Centenina) are all of them addle.

The Number of Eggs affords the same benefit, as plenty of Conceptions do in
Viviparous creatures; that is, they are useful to the continuation of the
species. For Nature does commonly bestow a plenteous issue upon those Animals
which are weak, and liable to the insolences of other Creatures: recompensing
the shortness of their lives, with the number of their offspring. Nature, says
Pliny, has bequeathed this legacy to the Race of Birds, that the l. 10. c. 52.
more fearful amongst them, should be more fruitful, then the more valiant.
For since all Generation is designed by Nature for Perpetuity sake, it befalls
those Animals more frequently, which are shorter lived, and obnoxious to
outward injuries, that so their species may not decay. Hereupon, Birds of Prey,
which excel in strength, and thence maintain their lives the longer, and
remain in more security, do seldom lay above two eggs. Indeed, the Pigeon,
Turtle, and Ring-dove, hatch but two eggs at once; but the frequency makes
satisfaction for the paucity, for they hatch ten times a year. So that they
Generate Much, though not Many.

Of the Benefits or Uses of the Yolk and White.
EXERCITATION LX.
AN Egg, says Fabricius, properly so called, is page 47.
compounded of several parts, because it is the Organ or Instrument of the
Generant; and Galen affirms, That every Organ consists of several parts. Which
gives an occasion of doubt, whether every egg be not Heterogeneous, seeing
every egg is an Organ. And indeed, every egg seems to be constituted out of
several parts, even the very eggs of Insects, and Fishes: for they all consist
of Membranes, Coverings, and Muniments: and the Matter also contained in them,
is not altogether destitute of a dissimilar constitution.

Fabricius does also farther conclude truly, with Galen, That some parts of the
Egg are the chief Instruments of Action; others, such Instruments as the
Action cannot be performed without them; others, as conducing to the better
performance of the Action; and lastly, others, as useful to the safety and
preservation of all the rest. But he is deceived, where he says; If we speak
of the chief Action of all, which is the Generation of the Chicken, the chief
cause thereof is the Seed, and the Chalaza; for these two are the prime cause
of the generation of the chicken: the Seed being the Efficient cause, and the
Chalaza the material only. For, as Aristotle affirms, he must of necessity
acknowledge, that the Generant must be within the Egg. But he denies the Cocks
seed to be within the Egg.

Nor is he less mistaken concerning the Material cause, out of which the
Chicken is made by the artifice of the seed. For it is neither made of both the
Chalazae, nor yet of any one of them, as has been discovered in our History.
Nor is the Generation of the Chicken accomplished by a Metamorphosis, or
delineation and division of the Chalazae, but by in Epigenesis, as we have
explained. Nor is the Chalaza principally fructified by the seed, but the
Cicatricula rather, or the Eggs-eye, as we call it: out of which being
enlarged, the colliquamentum does result: and afterward in the colliquamentum,
and out of it, the Blood, Veins, Vesiculae pulsantes, and the whole Body is at
last constituted. And upon his own confession, the seed of the Cock does not so
much as pass into the womb of the Hen at all: and yet notwithstanding it does
fructify, not only the Eggs already formed, but those also that shall be
formed hereafter.

To the Eggs second Action (which is the Nutrition, and Augmentation of the
Chicken) Fabricius calls in the White and Yolk. The Quantity of the yolk and
white, says he, is proportioned to the better performance of the former
action, as also to the absolution and just increase of the chicken. The
Egg-shell, and Membranes, are constituted for the safeguard of the whole, and
also of the action of the Egg. But the veins, and arteries, which do convey the
aliment, are such as without them the increase and nutrition could not proceed.

But yet he leaves us in suspense, not knowing whether he mean the Umbilical
Vessels of the foetus it self, or the veins and arteries of the mother, as
those instruments by which the egg is augmented. And yet upon as good ground,
both the Uterus, and the Incubation it self, may be reduced into this classis.

Come we then to the Liquors of the Egg, namely the Yolk and White, for these
are, rather then the other parts, instituted for the sake of the foetus, and
also in them the second action of the Egg is most remarkable.

Hen-eggs are of two colors, and constituted of two liquors, which are fenced
by distinct membranes, and kept apart the one from the other: and likewise,
since they are distinguished by a twofold propagation of Umbilical Vessels
(whereof the one passes to the Yolk, the other to the White) they themselves
are in all probability of a different nature, and therefore of a diverse use
and advantage. The Yolk and White of Eggs, says Aristotle, do obtain a
contrary nature; not only in regard Hist. an. l. 6. c. 2.
of Heat, but Power: for the Yolk is condensed by cold, but the White is not
only not condensed thereby, but liquified the more. So on the contrary, the
White is condensed by fire, but the Yolk is not condensed by it, but continues
soft, unless it be very much burned: And is more condensed, and dried by being
sodden, then roasted. The Yolk being now warmed by Incubation, becomes more
moist; for it resembles melted wax, or dissolved fat: whereupon also it fills a
larger room then before. For by degrees, as the foetus is enlarged, the White
is consumed and thickened: but the Yolk on the contrary, when the foetus is now
complete, seems to have lost little or nothing of its dimensions, but seems only
to be more liquid and moist, even when the belly of the foetus begins now to be
covered over with the Abdomen.

And Aristotle gives the reason of this differences De genesis an. l. 3. 5, 2.
Because a Bird cannot complete her of spring within (...) own bowels, she
produces the Aliment also together i^ the Egg. For in Viviparous creatures the
nourishment of the foetus, which is called milk, is provided in a distinct part
of the body; namely, in the Breasts. But Nature has implanted this aliment in
the Eggs of Birds: but yet contrary to the Opinion of most men, and the
Assertion of Alcmaeon Crotoniates; for the White is not the Milk of the Egg,
but the Yolk. For as the foetus of Viviparous Animals, adhering hitherto to
their parent (as the Plant does to the ground) attract their first aliment from
her womb: but after their birth, being then seated without the Uterus, they
suck milk from the breast, and so increase: so the Chicken finds something
proportionable to both these aliments in the Egg it self: for as the Uterus of
Viviparous Animals is within the parents themselves; so on the contrary, in
Oviparous, the parents themselves may be said to be within their Uterus. For an
egg it as it were an exposed womb; wherein there is a substance concluded, as
the Representative, and Substitute or Vicar of the Breasts. For the Chicken in
the egg is first nourished by the White, which being exhausted, it is
afterward sustained by the Yolk, as by Milk. And therefore the Navel or
Umbilical propagation, which is derived into the White, when the white is
spent, does fade, and break off before the Chicken is hatched, leaving no track
or relic remaining, but quite vanishes, before the Lower belly is shut up in
the Abdomen (when yet in the race of Viviparous Animals the Navel-string
continues still:) But as for that other propagation of the Umbilical Vessels,
which is disseminated into the yolk (when the abdomen is now drawn over the
guts) it is, together with the yolk it self, laid up in the belly, and thence
attracts nutriment for the tender foetus; till the bill, being now confirmed,
and hardened, is able to pick up, and break its meat into pieces, and the
Stomach, or Gisard, be fortified to digest it: As the production of Viviparous
Animals is sustained with milk from the Dug, till it be provided of teeth, by
which it may chew and grind its food. For the Yolk is instead of Milk to the
Chicken: and therefore a Hen-egge (being to supply the office both of the Womb
and Breast or Udder) is furnished with a party colored juice, namely the Yolk
and White.

And as for these two distinct Liquors all men living do admit them; But I, as
I lately told you, have discovered even two distinct Whites in an egg, divided
by two distinct Membranes, the superior White comprehending another within it;
just as the Yolk is comprehended by the White. And these two Whites are of a
different nature: being reserved in a distinct place, and contained or
concluded in a distinct Membrane, and therefore designed to a distinct use and
intent. And yet both are designed to Nutrition: but the exterior is first
devoured, as having the propagations of the Umbilical Vessels (which are
derived to the Whites) first disseminated into it, before they pass into the
other White which is thicker then it: just as those very propagations do first
assault both the Whites, ere they set upon the Yolk which is encompassed by
them, and which is reserved for the last nourishment of the foetus.

But of this more hereafter, when we come to explain the manner, how the foetus
of Viviparous Animals is formed, and augmented in the Womb, and also to
demonstrate, that every foetus what ever does derive its original from an Egg;
and is sustained by a twofold Albugineous Aliment in the Uterus. For one of
these is thinner, and contained within the Egg (or Conception) it self: the
other is attracted and drawn by the Umbilical Vessels from the Cotyledones, or
Orifices of the Vessels disseminated into the Afterbirth, and the Womb. That
substance is contained in the Conception it self, does resemble the thinner
White, both in color, and consistence, for it is glewy, liquid, and pellucid,
and very like that substance, which we call the Colliquamentum in the Egg, and
in this the foetus swims, and is fed by it at the mouth. But that which the
foetus attracts by the aid of his Umbilical Vessels from the Placenta or
After-burden, is more thick and mucous, and very like to the thicker White of
the egg. By which it plainly appears, that the foetus is no more sustained in
the Womb by his mothers blood, then the sucking Child is afterward nourished
by it, or the Chicken in the egg: but is fed by an Albugineous Matter, which
is concocted in the Placenta or Cake of the Womb; and does resemble the White
of an Egg.

Nor is the contemplation of that divine providence less profitable, then
wonderful; by which nature both in the Generation and Growth of the foetus (as
taking into her consideration their age, and abilities) provides a convenient
aliment for each of them, accommodating meats of more easy to some, and of
more difficult digestion to others. For as the foetus attains a greater
strength and ability to digest; so is a grosser and tougher aliment provided
for him. And this may be observed even in the diverse kind of Milk in Animals:
for when the Infant is new born, the Mothers Milk is thinner, and of more
facile digestion; but in process of time, and the strength of the foetus being
now improved, it grows thicker and more coagulated. And therefore those choice
and delicate Dames, which do not suckle their Infants themselves, are injurious
to their Childrens welfare; for since mercenary Nurses are for the most part of
a ranker constitution, then they: and so have older Milk, and more coagulated,
and consequently of harder digestion; it often falls out, that the Infants
which are born of such Mothers cannot away with the Milk of such Nurses
(especially about the time of breeding their Teeth) but by reason of crudities,
or corrupted Milk, are tormented with Fevers, Looseness, Vomitings, Pains in
the Guts, Coughs, and Epilepsies, and the like.

That which Fabricius affirms, and endeavors to strengthen with certain
arguments: namely, that the Chalazae are the subject matter of the page 34.
Chicken, we have formerly disproved in our History, and have withal made it
appear, that the substance and first lineaments of the chicken are laid, while
the Chalazae are entire, and unaltered: as likewise in a distinct place of the
Egg.

Nor is it true that the chalazae (which he conceivs the cocks seed does
fructify) do supply the office page 54.
of seed, that so the chicken might be made out of them. Neither do the
chalazae so represent the seed, in color, substance, or propriety of body (as
he would page 57.
have it) or so resemble the picture of a chicken in an egg that is boiled,
that we ought of right to conceive all the spermatical parts to be thence
extracted. But we are rather to conceive that the colliquamentum mentioned by
us, or the thinner part of the white resolved, and concocted, does put on the
nature of seed, and supply its place, as our eyes may evidence.

And therefore that contemplation of this reverend sage is too supi^e, where he
says: Since the page 54.
whole substance of the Animal is constituted of two different, and contrary
bodies; namely, hot, and cold, (all the red and sanguineous parts being hot, as
the Liver, Heart, Spleen, Reins, Lungs, and in short all the fleshy, and
musculous parts: and on the contrary, all the White and Bloodless, as the
Ligaments, Nerves, Bones, Gristles; and all the Membranous parts, as the
Stomach, Guts, Womb, the Pericardium, or Purse of the Heart and the like, are
cold) these two diverse kind of parts, do, without question, require a diverse,
and yet a like Aliment to sustein them; if that position be true, namely, ex
iisdem nutrimur, ex quibus constamus, we are nourished by the same substances,
out of the which we are made. Therefore of right, do the Spermatical cold, and
white parts, require a white and cold Aliment; but the Sanguineous, the red,
and hot parts, require a red and hot sustenance. And therefore of good right is
the White of the Egg, which is cold and bloodless, deputed to nourish the cold;
white, and bloodless parts; but the Yolk, as being a hot, red, and sanguineous
Liquor, substituted to the hot, and sanguineous. For by this means all the
parts of the Animal, may cater and procure for themselves a convenient and
familiar nutriment. For we do by no means consent, that the diverse parts of
the egg, are ordained to nourish the diverse parts of the chicken, having
formerly showed, that the Heart, Lungs, Reins, Liver, Muscles, Ligaments, and
all the parts of the whole body, do appear white and bloodless at the first.

And upon this argument of Fabricius, it would ensue, that the Heart, Lungs,
Liver, Spleen, etc. are not Spermatical parts, or constituted out of the Seed:
(which he will upon no terms consent to) because they also are afterward fed,
and increased by Blood; for all things are made, and nourished by one and the
same thing; because nutrition is only a substitution of a like substance into
the room of that which is lost.

Nor will it less distract him to make answer, how (when the white is now clean
exhausted) the cold, and white parts (namely, the Ligaments, Bones, Brain,
Spinal-Marrow, etc.) are likewise nourished, and enlarged by the Yolk, the Yolk
being no less a disproportionated aliment to these, then the White is to the
hot, red, and sanguineous parts.

Nay, according to the forecited opinion, the hot, and sanguineous parts are
to be the post-genit parts, or born last: that is, the Flesh after the Bones;
the Liver, and the Lungs after the Ligaments and Guts: and the cold parts of
the body are to be upon the Forge all the while the White is consuming; and
after them the hot, when the Yolk begins to decline and wash it self away to
supply their growth: so that all the parts could not possiby arise out of the
same Whites. But all these matters are confuted by ocular experiment.

To confirm this: the Eggs, or Spawn of Cartilagineous Fishes (namely, the
Ray, the Fork-fish, and the Dog-fish) are partly colored, and have a well
complexioned Yolk; and yet all the parts of those very fishes (even the
Parenchyma of the Liver it self) appears white, cold, and bloodless. And on the
contrary, I have seen a race of Hens and Cocks, which are of a large stature,
their feathers blackish, their flesh full of blood, and their Liver more ruddy
then ordinary; and yet their eggs, even the fertile ones, have exceeding pale
Yolks, of no deeper a yellow then the straw of ripe Barley.

Fabricius in the subsequent words, seems to retract his former speeches:
saying, But one thing is page 55.
very wonderful both in the Yolk and White; that neither of them being blood,
yet they are so near of kin to blood, that they are but little different from
it, and a small matter keeps them from being, very blood it self: and
therefore a little pains, and a slender concoction suffices to convert them
into blood. And this is the reason why we always discover those Veins and
Arteries which are propagated into the membranes of the Yolk and White to be
full of blood; and yet the Yolk and White abide still in their own nature: but
so soon as either of the two is attracted into the Vessels, it presently
transforms into blood; so near allied are they to blood.

Now if it is most certain, that blood is no less contained in those
propagations of the Veins which are disseminated into the White, then in those
that are derived into the Yolk: and each of these Liquors is so nearly related
to blood, that a very small matter will procure their transmigration into it;
who will deny, that the blood, and consequently all the Sanguineous parts are
as well nourished and enlarged by the White, as by the Yolk.

Hereupon Fabricius provides for his retreat: saying, Though all this be true,
yet we are to conceive, Ibid.
that this substance, which is attracted from the Yolk and White by the Veins,
is blood in that manner only, as Chyle is in the Meseraick Veins; in which there
is nothing discoverable but mere blood; whereas the Chyle has only received
the shadow of blood, and is to be completed in the Liver; so that substance
attracted by the Veins out of the Yolk and White, presently puts in the shadow
and resemblance of blood, etc. Well, be it so: yet though he lurk in this
shadow, he does not salve the doubt, which is, why the Blood, and sanguineous
parts may not, for the forecited reasons, be as well nourished by the White as
the Yolk.

If he had said, that the hotter parts, are rather nourished by that blood (or
Aliment contained in the blood, which is proportionable to the Chyle) which is
attracted out of the Yolk, then out of the White: and so on the contrary, that
the cold parts are supplied rather by that Nutriment which the Veins transport
from the White, then from the Yolk, I should not have much opposed him.

The main thing that disturbs him in this business, is this, how the Blood can
be made in the Egg; or what Artificer can transform the two Liquors into
blood, when there is yet no Liver in Being? For he could not say that the blood
in the Egg is derived from the Mothers blood. But says, This blood is rather
wrought in the Veins then in the Liver: but it becomes a bone, a gristle, or
flesh, etc. in the parts themselves, where it is exactly concocted, and
assimulated, without any farther addition at all; not signifying by whom the
blood which is in the Veins dispersed both into the Yolk and White, is
concocted, elaborated, and made perfect, when as yet no Liver at all is extant,
or any particle of the body, that might concoct or complete it. And when he had
formerly said, that the cold parts are nourished by the White, the hot by the
Yolk; not mindful of his assertion, he here concludes the quite contrary, viz.
that the same blood does transmigrate into bones, gristles, flesh, and other
parts.

But he lets that grand difficulty, which so much disouiets the Physicians
minds, glide by in silence, without taking any knowledge of it: namely, how the
Liver can be the Original and Author of the blood: seeing that blood is not
only found in the egg, before any one of the bowels are framed at all: but
Physicians themselves do teach, that all the substance or Parenchyma of the
bowels themselves, are merely so many affusions; or confluxes of blood. Is the
Effect, the Author of its own Efficient? If the Parenchyma of the Liver is made
of blood, how can the Liver be the cause of blood?

And the ensuing passages are of the same batch, where he says: There is also
another use of the White, when it is now segregated from the Yolk: namely, that
the foetus may swim in it, and so be sustained, lest tending downwards by his
own weight, he might incline to one part rather then another, and so drawing
the Vessels along with him, might break them in sunder: and to this use the
purity and tenacity of the White do conduce. For if the foetus should take up
his residence in the Yolk, he would easily descend down into the bottom, and
so disorder and break the Yolk also.

A very weak construction this! For what does the purity of the White avail to
the sustentation of the Chicken? Or how can the White which is more thin,
better support the Chicken, then the Yolk which is thicker and more gross then
it? Or what danger is there, that the Chicken should fall down? Since the egg
in Incubation lies always side-long, so that there is no fear of ascent, or
falling down. True it is, indeed, that not only the Chicken, but every foetus
whatsoever (while it is forming) does swim: but that innatation is in the
Colliquamentum spoken of by us, and not in the Yolk or White: and we have
rendered the reason thereof elsewhere.

Aristotle (says he) Writes, that when the Chicken is conceived, the Yolk
ascends to the Obtuse Angle of the Egg, and the reason is, because the Chicken
is formed out of the Chalaza, which adhereth to the Yolk; whereupon it behooves
the Yolk, which is placed in the middle to mount up to the larger part of the
Egg; that so the Chicken may be there made, where there is a natural cavity,
very necessary to the welfare of the Chicken. But the Chalaza is more fastened
to the White, then to the Yolk.

But the reason of that ascent of the Yolk is this; the Macula or little
cicatrice which appears in the coat of the Yolk, is by reason of the spirituous
colliquamentum which is bred in it, dilated; and thereupon requiring more
room, does tend toward the Obtuse Angle of the Egg: and so likewise that
portion of the Yolk and White which is melted, is distended, and being now
grown more concocted and spirituous, does swim upon the other parts that
remain crude: as those parts of water which are warmed in any vessels, arise
from the bottom up to the top: an experiment approved by all Physicians, who
holding the Urinal containing a thick and troubled Urine in warm water, do
perceive the upper part thereof, to clear and grow transparent first. This
following Instance will explain the matter. There is a device known to most
men, which is intended rather for a jocular babble to gaze upon and laugh at,
then for any useful implement; namely, a certain Glass-globe, which is almost
filled up with clear water, wherein several Glass-balls which are fraught with
nothing but Air, do swim upon the surface of that water, which by reason of
their levity do support several figures (of quivered Cupids, armed Centaures,
Chariots of the Sun, and the like) which else would all sink down to the
bottom. So in like manner, this Oculus pulli, this Eye of the Chicken as I
term it, or first Colliquation, being dilated by the heat of the Sitting-Hen,
and the Genital virtue in the Egg, and so made lighter, ascends to the top,
and draws up the Yolk to which it adheres together with it. Hereupon the
thicker White gives place to it, and the Chalazae retire to the sides of the
Egg, because the Cicatricula, which was formerly fituate in the side of the
egg, now mounteth directly upward.

Of the Uses of the other parts of the Egg.
EXER. LXI.
THe Shell is hard and thick, that so it may fence the Liquors, and the Chicken
which dwells in them, from outward injuries. But yet it is brittle, and
especially in the Obtuse end, and near the time of the exclusion of the
Chicken, lest it might obstruct the Chickens Exit. This Shell is also porous,
for while an egg (especially a new-laid one) is in roasting before the fire,
it does breath out a kind of sweat, trickling down, as it were, drop by drop.
Now these pores are useful for Ventilation, as also for the more easy
penetration of the heat which results from the Sitting Hen; and likewise that
the Chicken may attract air from without: for as we have said before, the
chicken does, without all question, both breath, and cry before his exclusion.

The Membranes serve to contein the Liquors, and therefore they are as many in
number, as the liquors are. And the Colliquamentum also, so soon as it is in
being, is presently invested in its own proper tunicle: as Aristotle did imply
in these words. A membrane also, variegated with sanguineous Hist. an. l. 6. c.
3.
fibers, does now incompass the white Liquor, etc. But now when the exclusion
of the Pullus is at hand, and the White and Colliquamentum are exhausted, all
the Membranes (excepting only that which embraces the Yolk) are dried away,
and vanish: but that membrane is together with the Yolk drawn into the
Peritonaeum, and concluded in the lower Belly. Now of these membranes, two are
common to the whole egg, which they do immediately comprehend next under the
Shell; but the other are proper membranes, relating to the White, the Yolk, and
the Colliquamentum: but they all of them serve to the preservation, and
distinction of those parts which they embrace. Of the two Common coats, the
exterior which does stick to the Shell, is the tighter, that so it may not
suffer violence by the neighborhood of the Shell, but the interior is smooth
and soft, that so it may not prejudice the Liquors, as the Meninges or
membranes called dura and pia matter, do defend the Brain, from the roughness
of the Scull. The interior, and proper membranes do, (as I have said) embrace,
and distinguish the Liquors: whereupon they are very thin, transparent and
frail.

Fabricius does indeed highly extol the Chalazae, (as those parts out of which
he conceived the Chicken was framed) but as for the Macula, or little Cicatrice,
which is bred adhering to the tunicle of the yolk; he concludes it to be a
useless thing, esteeming it to be no more then a bare relic or remainder of
the stalk broken off from the Vitellary, or superior Uterus of the Hen. For
(according to his persuasion) the yolk did formerly attract its sustenance
through that stalk, or the Vessels passing through it; but the yolk being now
no longer nourished by the Hen, but disjoined from the Ovary, there still
continues a sign or track of the former conjunction, and the benefits received
thereby.

But I on the contrary apprehend, that there is no other use of the Chalazae,
beyond that which I formerly observed; namely, that they should be as the Poles
of that Microcosme, and the ends or connexions of all the membranes wound up
together, whereby the liquors are not only continued each in their proper
places, but also retain a just and convenient position in relation to one
another. But as for the foresaid Macula, I am certain, that it is of the
greatest concern and consequence of all; as being the chief Center of the Egg,
wherein the Innate heat hovers and lurks, and out of which, as out of the first
spark, the soul her self is lighted; and lastly, for whose sake, all the
liquors, and their respective coverings are constituted, and made.

Heretofore, indeed, I was of Fabricius his mind, deeming this little Cicatrice
to be nothing else but the remainder or track of the stalk broken of; but
afterward, upon more accurate observation, I discovered, that the stalk,
whereunto the yolk is annexed, is not inserted into any little cranny or cavity
of the yolk (as it is with the stalks of Apples, and Plumms) and that so some
track or print of the connection or dependence which the yolk once had upon the
Ovary, should continue in it; but that the stalk, before it arrives to the Yolk
from the Cluster, is all the way dilated into a round, (like a little trumpet)
that so it may encompass the horizon, or the circle of the Yolk, which divides
it into two parts; (as the Tunica Amphiblestroides, or tunicle which resembles
a little round Casting-Net, does the Egg) so that the superior part of the
Yolk, or Hemisphere, which looks toward the Cluster, is quite free from any
contact or coherence of the stalk, and yet the forementioned Macula, or little
Cicatrice, is seated upon the superior part of that little cup, or portion of
the membrane of the Yolk; (something inclining toward the side) so that this
Macula can upon no terms be said to be the print of the stalk broken off from
the Yolk. But of how great importance this macula is in the generation of the
Chicken, has already been discovered in our History.

It now remains, that following the stepps of Fabricius, who was formerly my
Tutor, and is now my Guide, I should declare the uses of that Cavity which is
in the obtuse part of the Egg.

Fabricius recounts several conveniences arising from it, according to its
several magnitude: which I shall declare in short, saying, It contains air in
it, and is therefore commodious to the Ventilation of the Egg, to the
Respiration, Transpiration, and Refrigeration, and lastly to the Vociferation
of the Chicken. Whereupon, that Cavity is at the first very little, afterward
greater, and at last greatest of all, according as the several recited uses do
require.

And thus far have we discoursed, concerning the Generation of the Egg and
Chicken, and the Uses of all the parts of the Egg; according to which
discourse, we are to conclude and give judgment concerning all kinds of
Oviparous productions. We are now to declare the manner of the Generation of
Viviparous animals, according to the example and pattern of the Generation of
some one Viviparous Animal which is perfectly known, and discovered, by us.

That an Egg is the Common Original of all Animals.
EXER. LXII.
ANimals, says Aristotle, have this in common together with Plants; that some
do spring out of Hist. an. l. 1. c. 1.
seed, and some of their own accord: for as Plants do either arise from the
seed of other Plants, or else spring up of their own accord, having attained
some principle fit for their production: and some of them do attract aliment to
themselves out of the earth, and some again are bred in other plants: so some
Animals are generated by the cognation or affinity of their form; and some of
their own accord, no seed at all proceeding which is of kin to them: whereof
some are generated out of putrefied earth or plants, (as several Insects)
others are begotten in Animals themselves, and out of the excrements of their
parts. But this is common to all those (whether they be generated of their own
accord, or else in other Animals, or out of the putrefaction of their parts, or
their excrements) namely, to arise out of some principle fit for that purpose,
and by some efficient contained in that principle: so that All living creatures
must of necessity have a principle out of which, and by which they are
begotten. Give me leave to call this principle, Primordium vegetale, the
vegetal principle; namely, some corporeal substance, having life in it in
potentia, or something subsisting of it self, which is apt to be transformed
into a vegetative form, by some internal principle acting in it: Namely, such a
principle as the Egg, and the seed of Plants is: such is the conception of
Viviparous Animals, and the Worm of Insects, as Aristotle calls it: the
principles of diverse Animals being also diverse, according to the diversity of
which principles, the manner of the generation of Animals is diverse likewise:
and yet they all consent and agree in this, that they spring from a vegetal
principle, as out of a matter endowed with an efficient or productive virtue;
but differ, in that this principle does either result casually, or of its own
accord, or else proceed from something pre-existent, (as the fruit thereof.)
Whereupon those Animals are called sponte nascentia, spontaneous productions,
these a parentibus genita, ofsprings derived from their parents. They are also
distinguished from their manner of Birth; for some of them are Oviparous,
others Viviparous: to which Aristotle adds Hist. an. l. 1. c. 5.
Vermiparous. But if we may distinguish them, as they fall under sense, there
are only two Species or sorts of productions; namely, these: all Animals do
either produce an Animal Actu, actually; or potentia, potentially. Those
Animals which produce an Animal actu, are called Viviparous; and those that
produce an Animal in potentia, Oviparous. For every principle which is only
alive in potentia, we (with Fabricius) do conceive, ought to be called Ovum, an
Egg: and as for that principle which Aristotle calls Vermis, a Worm, we do not
at all distinguish it ab Ovo, from an Egg; and that because it looks like one
to the eye, and also because that indistinction seems consonant to reason. For
that Vegetal Principle, which is alive in potentia, is also an Animal in
potentia. Nor is that distinction which Aristotle puts between an Egg, and a
Worm, to be allowed of; for he calls that an Egg, ex cujus part fit Animal,
out of part of which an Animal is made: quod autem totum mutatur, Genesis an. l.
3. c. 7. Hist. an. l. 1. c. 5.
nec ex part ejus Animal gignitur, est Vermis: and that a Worm, which is
wholly transformed, and does not produce an Animal out of some part of it only.
But now these two do both agree in this, that they are productions not yet
alive, but Animals only in potentia; and therefore are both Eggs.

And Aristotle himself calls the very same things Hist. an. l. 5. c. 29. Ibid.
c. 30.
Worms in one place, and Eggs in another: And treating of Locusts, says, There
eggs are corrupted in Autumn, when it is wet weather: and (speaking of
Grasshoppers) When the little worm, says he, grows in the ground, it becomes
Tettigometra, a Grasshopper-matrix: and a little after, The females taste the
sweeter after coition; for they have white eggs. Nay, in that very place,
where he had raised a distinction between a Worm and an Egg, he adds; Genesis
an. l. 3. c. 9.
But all this kind of little worms, when it has attained the end of its
magnitude, is made a kind of Egg; for their shell does harden, and so long
they continue without motion: which is apparent in the worms of Bees, and
Wasps, and also in the Canker-worm. And indeed every body may see, that the
first rudiments of Spiders, Silkworms, and other Insects, are to be no less
ranked in the classis and scale of Eggs, then the spawn, or Eggs of Fishes
which have softer shells, or of Fishes which have no shells at all, and almost
of all sort of fishes whatsoever: which Spawn of theirs is not actually an
animate body, but yet Animals are begotten out of them. Since therefore those
creatures which do produce actu Animal, a Creature actually alive, are called
Viviparous: doubtless, those Animals which do bring forth a creature which is
alive in potentia, must be called Oviparous Animals, or else they cannot be
comprehended under any Common notion; especially, seeing such Productions are
vegetal Rudiments, proportionable to the seeds of Plants, such as an egg also
is allowed to be. We must therefore conclude, that all Animals are either
Viviparous, or Oviparous.

But because there are several species of Oviparous Animals, therefore the
difference of Eggs is also several. For any kind of Rudiment is not a
competent Recipient of every kind of animal form. Though therefore Eggs in a
large or general acceptance do not differ, yet since some are perfect, and
some imperfect, they are justly distinguished. Perfect Eggs we call those,
which are perfected in the Uterus, and obtain there a requisite magnitude,
before they are laid: as the Eggs of Foul. But those we call Imperfect, which
are excluded ere they are ripe, and have not yet attained their just bulk, but
do expect that abroad, after they are laid; as the Spawn or Eggs of Fishes,
that have a softer shell, and of Fishes which have none at all; and likewise
the Rudiments of Insects (which Aristotle calls Worms) are to be listed in this
rank: as also the Rudiments of those Creatures which are spontaneous
productions.

Moreover, though some kinds of perfect Eggs are party-colored, as being
compounded of a yolk and white; yet some of them are only of one single color,
as constituted of a white alone: so also amongst imperfect Eggs, others are
properly so called, as out of which a perfect Animal is produced, as out of the
Eggs of Fishes: and others improperly, from whence an imperfect Animal
proceeds; namely, a Worm, or Canker-worm; which is a kind of Medium between a
perfect, and an imperfect Egg: which in respect or comparison of its own egg,
or Rudiment from whence it sprung, is an Animal endowed with Sense and Motion,
and does nourish it self; but in comparison of a Fly, or Butterfly, whose
rudiment is in potentia, it is to be counted no better then a crawling-egge,
sustaining it self: like to a Canker-worm, which having now attained its
perfect magnitude, is transformed into an Aurelia, or perfect Egg; and now
ceasing to move any longer, like a very Egg indeed, is an Animal in potentia.

In like manner, though there are some Eggs, out of whose whole and entire
substance (by a Metamorphosis, or Transformation) a perfect Animal is formed,
which is not fed by any remaining portion of the Egg, but instantly seeks out
for its maintenance abroad: and other Eggs, out of part of which a Foetus is
constituted, and nourished by the remainder; though (I say) there are so many
several sorts and diversities of Eggs, yet nothing stands in the way, to forbid
those to be called Eggs, which Aristotle styles Worms, (if we may give
judgment upon things, according as they discover themselves to our sense and
reason) since they are all Vegetal principles, not actually Animals, but in
potentia, and the true seeds of Animals, proportionable to the seeds of Plants;
as we have long since demonstrated in a Hen-egg. All Animals therefore, are
Viviparous, or Oviparous; because they either produce an Animal actually alive,
or else an Egg, or Rudiment, which is an Animal, not actu, but in potentia.

The Generation therefore of all Oviparous Animals may be reduced to the
example of Hen-eggs, or at least be easily deduced from thence: because the
same things which are related in their history, may be discovered in the rest
of Viviparous creatures.

But hereafter, when we treat of the Generation of Insects, and of Spontaneous
productions, we shall discover how each of them are either differenced amongst
themselves, or do else agree. For since every generation is a pathway to the
attaining of the form of every Animal: according as Animals are either like, or
unlike one another, so that their parts do neither specifically, nor
generically agree; so likewise is it usual in their Generations. For Nature,
who is a Perfect Operatrix, and consonant to her self in her Operations, does
design Parts that are alike, to Operations and Functions that are alike and
agree; and so likewise to the attainment of the same form, and the same end,
she treads the same steps, and persists always in the same method in the
Generation of Animals.

Hereupon, in every perfect party-colored egg of any foul whatever (which is
compounded of a Yolk and White, and fenced with a Shell) as we have still
observed the same parts, as are in a Hen-egg, so have we ever found the same
order and method of generating, and constituting the foetus (as in a Hen-egg.)
And the self same things may also be observed in the Eggs of Serpents, and all
Oviparous four-footed Animals, as the Tortoise, Froggs, and Lizards; as from
whose perfect and party-colored eggs, the foetus is framed and produced, the
same way, as in others of the like kind. But how Spiders, and the softer
Shellfish, as Lobsters, and Shrimps, and the race of Fishes that have scales
and no shells, as the Cuttle-fish and the Calamire do get out of their Eggs, or
Spawn; as also how Worms, and Catterpillars do first creep out of the Eggs of
Insects, out of which, at length retreating into the worm or vermin called
Aurelia, (as into other new eggs again) at last a common Fly, or Butterfly is
generated; how these Creatures, I say, do differ in their Generation out of
Eggs, from the brood arising out of Hen-eggs, shall be declared in its due
place.

Lastly, though all party-colored eggs are not generated and fructified the
same way; but some become prolifical by the Coition of a Male and Female, and
others by other means, as the eggs or fry of Fishes; and though there be
also a difference in the manner of the growth of Eggs, insomuch as some are
nourished and increased within their parents bowels, and others abroad: yet
nothing hinders, why a foetus may not be produced out of any egg whatsoever,
(in case it be a perfect egg) as well as out of a Hen-egge. Wherefore, the
History wherein we have already unfolded the generation of a Hen-egge, is
satisfactory and full enough for the knowledge of the Generation of all other
Oviparous creatures beside; as likewise to the knowledge of all those things
which do thence ensue, by way of Corollary, or Deduction.

Of the Generation of Viviparous Animals.
EXER. LXIII.
THus far have we proceeded in the Generation of Oviparous Animals; it
follows, that we now produce our Observations, concerning the other species of
Viviparous productions: wherein we have found very many things which are
altogether the same with those which occur in the Egg; which we have reduced
hither to be consulted, and come last to be delivered. Which, though they are
paradoxical, and run counter to the common received tenets, yet are they, if my
judgment fail me not, entirely consonant to the Truth.

Amongst Viviparous Animals, Man is the chief, and most perfect of all: next
him (that we may proceed from such as are more known) are ranked those
creatures that are more sociable and obvious: (whereof some are solidipeda,
whole-hoofed; as the Horse, and Ass: some are Bisulca, cloven footed; as the
Ox, the Goat, the Sheep, the Hogg, and the Deer: others fissipeda, sive
digitatis pedibus, Creatures whose feet are distinguished into Toes; as the
Dog, the Cat, the Cony, the Mouse, and the like; out of the manner of whose
generation, we may conclude concerning the generation of all other Viviparous
Animals. Wherefore, (as we have done in the History of the Egg, so) we shall
single out some one kind of these, as an Exemplar or Representative of all the
rest; which, as being most known to us, will give light to the rest, and become
a platform, to which all the other may be reduced, by way of Analogy.

I have already given you the reason, why I have drawn out documents concerning
all other Eggs, from the Eggs of Hens: namely because those are cheap, and
every man's purchase; and upon that score we our selves had the advantage to
make the more diligent disquisition, and others also have the better
opportunity to experiment the truth of our doctrine.

But there is more difficulty in the search into the Generation of Viviparous
Animals: for we are almost quite debarred of dissecting the humane Uterus: and
to make any inquiry concerning this matter, in Horses, Oxen, Goats, and other
Cattle, cannot be without a great deal of pains and expense. But those who are
desirous to make trial, whether we deliver truth, or not, may assay the
business, in Dogs, Conies, Cats, and the like.

Fabricius ab Aquapendente, as if every Viviparous conception were a kind of
egg, begins his Tract with that; (as being the general exemplar of Generation)
giving this amongst other, as the chief ground of his proceedings; namely,
because the contemplation of the egg, is of the largest extent: De form. Ovi
and Pulli, c. 1.
for the greatest part of Animals, says he, is generated out of Eggs. But we
in the entrance of these our Observations, have concluded that all Animals are
in some sort produced out of an Egg: For the foetus of Viviparous creatures is
produced after the same manner and order out of a pre-existent conception, as
the Chicken is formed and constituted out of an Egg: There being one and the
same species of generation in them all, and the exordium or first principle of
them all is either called an egg, or at lest something answerable and
proportionable to it. For an Egg is an exposed conception from which a Chicken
is produced; but a conception is an egg retained within, until the foetus
have attained its just bulk, and magnitude: in other matters it squares with an
egg: for they both are Vegetal rudiments, and also Animals in potentia.
Wherefore the same Theorems, and Corollaries, (though contrary to the received
persuasion) which we have already inferred in the History of the Egg, are most
true: Likewise of the generation of all kind of Animals. For it is a confessed
and plain thing, that all foetuses, even humane ones also, are procreated out
of some conception, (or certain groundwork.) And this is also as true: that
that thing which is called Primordium, the first rudiment in spontaneous
productions, semen, the seed in Plants, and Ovum the Egg, in Oviparous (as
being that corporeal substance, out of which moving and operating by an
intrinsecal principle, that which is produced is either a Plant or an Animal:)
that same thing in the Generation of Viviparous Animals is conceptus primus;
the first Conception: and this is approved to be true both by sense and reason.

What we have formerly affirmed of the egg, namely, that it is the sperme and
seed of Animals, proportionable to the seed of Plants: the same do we now
pronounce of the conception, which is the real seed of Animals, and therefore
also called An Egg. For that is true seed according to Aristotle, De gone. an.
l. 1. c. 18.
which takes its Original from two Animals joined in coition; and obtaines the
virtue or power from both Sexes; such is the seed of all Plants, and of some
Animals which know no distinction of Sexes: as it were that which is first
mixed from. Male and Female, being a kind of promiscuous conception, or Animal:
for these creatures have that in themselves alone, which is required of both
Sexes: namely, a fit matter to feed the foetus, and also a plastical, or
formative, and operative virtue able to produce it. So in like manner, the
conception is the fruit of the Male, and Female joined in coition, and also the
seed of the future foetus; wherefore it differs not from an egg.

But that, which proceeding from the Generant, is the cause which first obtains
the principle of Generation Ibid.
(viz. the Efficient) ought to be called the Geniture, but not the seed (as it
is miscalled by the common people, and Philosophers too at this day) because it
has not in it that thing which is required of two in coition, neither is it
proportionable to the Seed of Plants. But whatsoever does possess the foresaid
condition, and is answerable to the Seed of Plants, that also does deserve to
be called an Egg, and a Conception.

Also the definition of an Egg, delivered by Aristotle does fully square to
it: saying, An Egg is Hist. an. l. 1. c. 5.
that thing in perfect productions of part whereof an Animal is made, and
sustained by the remainder, after it is made. Now the same things agree to a
Conception, as shall afterward appear by the dissection of Viviparous Animals,
our Eyes themselves being witnesses thereunto.

Besides, as a Chicken is hatched out of an Egg, by the fostering heat of the
Sitting Hen, or some other ascititious hospitable patronage, so also the Foetus
is produced out of the conception in the egg, by the soft and most natural
warmth of the parent.

In a word: that which Oviparous Animals afford by Incubation, or gathering
under their Wings and Breast; that is exhibited by Viviparous, by the Womb, and
nearest, or inward embraces. And then, concerning that which relates to
procreation, the foetus is produced out of the Conception, in the self same
manner, and order, as the Chicken out of the Egg; With this only difference,
that in an egg, whatsoever relates to the Constitution and Nutrition of the
Chicken, is at once contained in it: but the conception (after the foetus is
now formed out of it) does attract more nourishment out of his Parents Womb;
whereupon the nourishment increases with the foetus. Moreover the Egg is quite
emptied, when the Chicken is grown; and the Aliment which was in it consumed,
nor does the Chicken attract any more sustenance from the Hen: but the
Oviparous Foetus does still find out fresh supplies, and susteineth it self by
Milk.

Now the Eggs, or Spawn of Fishes are supported by food procured from without;
the Eggs of Insects also, whether they have shells or not, have their
provisions from abroad, nor are they less eggs for that, either really, or
nominally: so in like manner the Conception deserves the title of an Egg,
though it be sustained by a various kind of Aliment from without.

Why some Animals are Oviparous, and all do not produce their Foetus alive,
Fabricius offers this reason: namely, because eggs (if they were detained in
the Uterus till the Pullus were hatched) would by their weight prejudice the
flight of Birds. And also in Serpents, or creeping things the multitude of
eggs would be an impediment to their winding motions. Nor is there compass
enough in the narrow circuit of the Snailes shell, to afford room to the number
and increase of eggs. So likewise the Fishes bellies are too scanty to contein
their numerous Fry, should they grow within them. And therefore these several
creatures are enforced to exclude their births, ere they arrive to perfection.
So that it seems most natural for an Animal, to contein and cherish its
conception within it self, until the foetus be quite perfected: but nature is
sometimes constrained to expose her issues immature, and imperfect, and to
complete them with provisions sought for from without.

For as much therefore as concerns procreation, All kind of Animals are
generated after the same manner out of an Egge-like Rudiment: (which we call
Egg-like, not that every Rudiment of an Animal does resemble an Egg in Figure,
but in Nature and Consistence) For in all their respective Generations this
they have in common, namely, that a certain Vegetal principle is pre-existent
(of like nature to an Egg, and answering in proportion to the Seed of Plants)
out of which the foetus is produced. And this Egg or Egg-like substance is in
them all, possessing the nature and conditions required in an Egg: which
conditions also the seeds of Plants have common to them, as well as Animals.
And for that cause the principles of any kind of Animals, are called their
Fruits, and Seeds, and so likewise the Seeds of all Plants may in a manner be
called Eggs, and Conceptions.

And to this purpose Aristotle speaks, saying: De genesis an. l. 3. c. 9.
Those creatures which bring forth an Animal from within themselves, have
something formed in them upon the first conception like unto an egg: for they
have an humor contained in a thin coat, such as that in an egg when the shell
is pilled off. Whereupon those depravations of conceptions which fall out about
that time, fluxus vocant, the people call, Fluxes, or miscarryings.

Those Fluxes are chiefly observable in Women, when they miscarry in the first
or second month: and such I have often seen discharged about those times: and
such a one also Hippocrates reports to have been discharged, and fallen from
the Minstrel.

The first Conception, or Rudiment therefore of all Hist. an. l. 7. c. 7.
Animals is in the Uterus: which according to Aristotle, is liks an egg covered
over with a membrane when the shell is pilled off. And this shall appear more
clearly by what shall be said hereafter. In the interim we conclude with the
Philosopher: All Animals, whether they be swimming, walking, or flying Animals;
and whether they be born in the form of an Animal, or of an Egg: are all
generated after the same manner.

The History of the Generation of Hinds and Does, is laid down as the Example
of all other Animals: together with the reason of our so doing.
EXERCIT. LXIV.
OUr late Sovereign King Charles, so soon as he became a Man, was wont for
Recreation, and Health sake, to hunt almost every week, especially the Buck and
Do; no Prince in Europe having greater store either wandering at liberty in the
Woods, or Forests, or enclosed and kept up in Parkes and Chaces. In the three
summer months, the Buck and Stagge, being then fat and in season, were his
game, and the Do and Hind in the Autumn, and Winter, so long as the three
seasonable months continued. Hereupon (for the Rutting time, when the Females
are lusty, and admit the Males, whereby they conceive and bear their young) I
had a daily opportunity of dissecting them, and of making inspection and
observation of all their parts; which liberty I chiefly made use of in order to
the Genital parts.

We shall therefore disclose the Generation of all Viviparous Animals, out of
the History of the Hind and Do, as being the most commodious Exemplar:
treating thereof after the same manner as we have already handled the
Generation of all Oviparous productions, out of the History of the Hen-Egge.
And this not from any peculiar design of my own, or for the same causes for
which I did prefer the Hen-Egge to all other: but because by the favor and
bounty of my Royal Master (whose Physician I was, and who was himself much
delighted in this kind of curiosity, being many times pleased to be an eye
witness, and to assert my new inventions) I had great store of his Dear at my
devotion, and frequent opportunity and license to dissect and search into them.

I intend therefore to set before you the History of Hinds and Does, composed
out of my sundry observe ations for many years together, whereby I my self am
chiefly versed in them, and from whence also something may be infallibly
concluded concerning the Generation of other Viviparous Animals: which History,
whilst we faithfully compile, we shall also insert all those observable
Occurrences, which we have either casually met withal, or else attained by
intended dissections in other Animals; namely, such as are cloven-footed,
whole-hoofed, and those which have their feet distinguished into toes, as
likewise in Man himself: declaring the series, or order of the Formation of the
Foetus, according to the several proceedings which Nature her self does
observe therein.

Of the Uterus of Hindes and Does.
EXER. LXV.
BEing about to treat of the Formation and Generation of the Hind and Do, we
must first discourse concerning the place wherein those actions are performed,
namely the Uterus; (as we have already done in the History of the Hen) that so
those things which ensue, may be more easily and rightly understood. For in
this very thing. History has the precedence of Romance and Fable; namely, in
that she describes events with their just circumstance of set times and places,
and so guides us unto knowledge by a surer way.

But that we may the better conceive the Deere's Uterus, we shall explain both
the internal, and external fabric thereof, taking our pattern from the womb of
Women. For Man, who is the most consummate or complete Animal of all other, as
he has obtained all other parts more perfect then they, so are his Genital
parts also. And therefore the Uterine parts are most distinct in a Woman, and
to us (by reason of the special industry of Anatomists about this Part) better
known.

Now in the Uterus of Hinds, and Does, many things do occurr which you may
discover to be the same in the womb of a Woman; but yet some things do differ.
In the external orifice, are neither the labra, nor the Clitoris, nor the
Nymphae; but only two Orifices (whereof one is the Orifice of the Bladder,
adjoined to the Share-bone; the other of the Privity, seated between the
fundament and the Urmary cavity.) The membranous Cuticle (like to that which we
have noted in a Hen) tending downwards from the fundament, does cover the
veil, and supply the office of the Nymphae and labia of the Privity, in order
to its defense from outward injuries: this veil is something retracted in a
Woman in coition, or at lest forced to retreat by the entrance of the Yard into
the Orifice of the Privity.

The Suture or connection of the Share-bones being divided in Hindes, or Does,
and the legs laid wide open, the Bladder of Urine, and Vagina Uteri, or
Privity wherein the Yard of the Male is entertained, as also the neck of the
Womb, and its situation, are presently discovered, together with the ligaments
whereby it is fastened, as likewise the Veins, Arteries, and Testieles, as
they call them: also the Horns of the Womb, even in these creatures, are more
remarkable then the other parts of it.

But as for the preparing, and the leading, or ejaculatory vessels, there are
no such things to be found here; nor (as far as I know) in any other Female
whatsoever: And Anatomists (who suppose that the Female does emit a seed in
coition) make too industrious an enquiry after them; for they are not at all in
some; and in those in whom they are, they are never found in the same manner,
or agreeing. Wherefore it comes nearest to truth, which also (as I have
observed) the greater part of Women acknowledge; namely, that they do not emit
any seed in coition. And though the more salacious do discharge a certain
moisture in coition, yet I neither approve it to be fruitful seed, nor
necessarily conducing to conception; for very many do conceive without any such
effusion at all: (and some also without any pleasure) but of these more
elsewhere.

The Privity, or Vagina Uteri, which is extended from the outward Orifice of
the secret parts, to the inward Orifice of the Womb, is in a Do, as in a
Woman, seated between the Bladder of Urine, and the Rectum intestinum, or Right
Gut, and is correspondent to the Yard of the male in form, largeness, and
longitude. And being dissected, is discovered to be furrowed with oblong
wrinckles and rugosities, and also made glibb and slippery with a stiff
moisture. In its bottom, you may perceive a more narrow and closed Orifice,
which is the beginning of the neck of the Uterus, through which, whatsoever is
driven out from the cavity of the Womb, does make its passage. And this is that
Orifice, which Physicians affirm to be so closely compressed, sealed up, and
concluded in a Virgin, and Woman with child, that it will not admit the point
of the finest Needle, or Probe.

After this follows the Neck, or Process of the Womb, which is a much longer
and rounder passage in them, then in Women; and in its whole extension, from
the bottom of the Privity to the Womb it self, is much more fibrous, thick, and
nervous, then theirs. And if you make incision into this Neck, according to its
longitude, you shall discover not only its exterior ingress, which is
conspicuous in the bottom of the Privity, so exactly to connive, and cling
together, that the air it self though driven by ones breath, cannot arrive at
the cavity of the Womb; but also five alike streights more ranked in order,
blocked up against the access of any outward approacher, and sticking firmly
together by a glewy mucilage: just as the most compact and narrow orifice of a
Woman's Uterus is locked up by a yellow glutinous substance. And such narrow
streights as these, are discernable in the neck of the Sheeps, Cowes, and Goats
womb, all which are close locked up, and forbid any admittance (which Fabricius
also observed.) But these five Recesses are most distinguishable in a Hind,
and a Do, appearing like so many several ports or orifices of the Uterus tied
up, and sealed fast, which you may justly esteem as so many Barracadoes opposed
to the admission of any thing whatsoever. So careful does Nature seem to have
been, that in case any insolent intruder should have forced the first gate, yet
his rudeness should be foiled by the next, making like provision in the other
Avenues, that so nothing might infinuate it self into the womb. And yet for all
this a Probe being put in from the Cavity of the Uterus outward, does with
ease pass through all these ports, and find a way out. For it was convenient
that a passage should be afforded to the discharge of Flatulencies, Menstruous
Blood, and other Humors; but all entrance debarred to the entertainment of
outward things, though they be never so little (as to the air itself, or the
Seed.)

This Uterine Orifice is alike blocked up in all other Animals, as it is in
Women; whose womb we have known so closed sometimes, that their Courses,
Purgations after delivery, and other humors, have for want of free
disburdening, excited most terrible Hysterical affections, insomuch that I have
been fain to invent an instrument proper to this inconvenience, whereby the
orifice of the womb being opened, the imprisoned superfluities might be
released, and the recited casualties subdued; as also that injections might
find a reception in the cavity of the womb, by which I have sometimes cured
the internal Ulcers of the Matrix, and also Barrenness it self.

The Cavity of the Uterus in Hindes and Does, is exceeding small, as the
substance of the Uterus is very little both in magnitude and thickness. For the
womb in those creatures, is only as a Porch, or Fore-Gate, in the Cavity
whereof lies an open way both on the right, and left hand, which leads to
the Horns of the Womb.

For those parts are different in almost all other Animals which have Blood,
from what they are in Women; in whom the chief part of the womb, is the Body
thereof: but the Neck, and the Horns, (as being only Appendixes) are scarce
discernable. For the Neck is short, and the Horns little, like round and long
processes, extended upwards from the bottom of the womb, like two Trumpets; the
Anatomists commonly conceiving them to be the Ejaculatory vessels. But in the
Hind and Do, as in all other Viviparous Animals which have blood (except only
Women, she-Apes, and those Female Animals that are whole-hoofed) the chief part
for Generation is not the Womb, but the Horns thereof. For in Women, and
whole-hoofed Beasts, the place of Conception is the Womb, but in other Animals,
the Conception is accomplished in the Horns of the Womb. And therefore Authors
generally call those Horns by the name of Uterus, the Womb, saying, that the
Womb in some Animals is bipartite, and in some not; understanding thereby the
places of Conception, which are the Horns of the womb, wherein almost all
Viviparous Animals, praesertine multipara, especially those that bring forth
several young ones at a birth, do conceive: and unto which also all the
Uterine veins and arteries are conducted, and the other Genital parts are
subservient. Wherefore give us leave also, in the History of those Animals, to
use promiscuously the name of Uterus or Womb, and of Horns of the womb, for the
same thing.

In a Woman, as we have said, the two Trumpets near the process of the Neck of
the womb, which are perforated into the cavity thereof, are not commonly
reputed proportionable to the Horns, but are conceited by some Anatomists to be
Vasa Spermatica, Spermatical Vessels; by others, Spiramenta Uteri, the Pores of
the Uterus; by a third sort, Vasa semen deferentia, aut reservantia, Leading
Vessels, or Vessels reserving the Seed in them. As if they were a certain kind
of Seminal vesicles; when, in truth, they are answerable in proportion to the
Horns of the womb of other Animals; as appears clearly, by their situation,
connection, largeness, perforation, form, and function: for as other Animals do
always conceive in the Horns, so a Woman also is sometimes found to bear her
Foetus in Cornu sive Tuba, in the Horn or Trumpet Anthrop. l. 2. c. 34.
of the womb, as the most learned Riolanus reports by the observation of other
men, and I have seen with my own eyes.

Those Horns do terminate in the Common Cavity, which (like a Porch or
Threshold) is seated before them both; and is in Deer proportionable to the
Woman's uterus, as the trumpets of the Woman's womb, are proportionable to the
Horns of the Deers womb. But their denomination they assume from their figure;
for as the Horns of a Ram or Goat are large at bottom, jutting out before, and
again reflected backward; so also these Horns of the womb (in Hindes and Does)
at their original are large and ample, and lessening by degrees as they look
upwards, are at last retorted toward the Spine of the Back. And as those other
Horns are inequal, knotty, and wrinkled in their forepart, but behind appear
smooth and even; so the Horns of the Deers womb, are below wrinckled, and
gathered, by reason of certain cells or rings bunching out, in manner like the
Gut Colon: but above (where they respect the Spine) they are smooth and even,
and recurved, as if they were tied back by a kind of fillet-like ligament, and
so by degrees grow slender as Horns do. If you take an empty gut (such a one as
puddings are made in) keeping it contract, wrinckled, and straightened, by a
tape or fillet which binds it all along on one side, you shall see it curled
and distinguished into little cells or windings (after the fashion of the Colic
Gut.) And such is the fabric of the Horns of the womb of a Hind, or a Do. In
other Females the case is different, for they either have larger cells, or none
at all. And in these Horns of Hinds and Does also, though there be several
cells or windings, yet are not all of equal magnitude, but the first is much
larger then any of the rest, and in it chiefly the Conception is contained.

And as in a Woman, the womb, and its trumpets (or Horns) with the rest of its
appurtenances, are tied fast to the Share-bones, the Back, and the neighbor
Parts, by the mediation of a broad and carnous Membrane, (as by a pendulous
band or tie) which Anatomists do style Vespertilionum alas, the Batts wings;
because the Uterus hanging in this manner, does resemble a Bat with its wings
spread abroad: so also in Hindes, and Does, the two Horns of the womb, together
with the Testicles, and all the Vessels of the Uterus, are by a thick membrane
fastened to the circumjacent Parts, (but especially to the Back) which membrane
performs the same office to the Uterine Parts, as the Meseutery does to the
Guts, and that which we call the Mesometrion does to the Uterus of the Hen. For
as by the Mesentery the Meseraick Veins and Arteries are derived to the Guts;
so are the Uterine Vessels disseminated through the foresaid membrane: in
which also certain small Bladders and Glandules are on both sides discovered,
which Glandules Anatomists commonly call the Testicles.

The substance of the Horns of the Hindes and Does wombs is cuticular or
skinny, or else a fleshy skin or coat (like that of the Guts) besprinckled with
certain slender Veins. This coat you may, as Anatomists use to do, divide into
several coats, observing the several situation of the fibers, which serve to
several functions, namely to Retention, and Expulsion. For I have many times
seen those Horns moving just like Earthworms; in the same manner as any man
may perceive the Guts, in an Animal newly killed, and the abdomen or covering
of the lower belly laid open, stirring to and fro, in a kind of waving motion,
whereby (as if they were close begirt and bound in by some small narrow ring,
or pressed and squeezed between ones fingers) they crowd down and depress the
Chyle and Excrement toward the inferior Guts.

All the Uterine Veins do here (as in a woman) assume their original from the
Hollow vein, near the Emulgents: but the Arteries (which they also do partake
as well as Women) do arise from the Branches of the Great Artery, which pass
into the Thighs: and as in a woman great with child, the Uterine Vessels which
contain blood, are more and greater then in the rest of her body; so is it also
with Hindes and Does which are with Fawn. But the Arteries (contrary to that
Which we see in the rest of the body) are much more numerous for their
proportion then the Veins; and being blown into, they will distend, and fill
their neighbor veins, but the veins being in the same manner blown into, will
never do so much for them. And this also I see taken notice of by the learned
Riolanus, and it is a prevalent argument for the Circulation of the Blood,
which was my Invention; for it does clearly evince a passage from the Arteries
into the Veins, but no retreat from the Veins into the Arteries again: and
there are likewise more Arteries then Veins, because the foetus requires great
store of sustenance to supply his growth, the remainder whereof fewer Veins are
sufficient to return.

There are also Testicles discernable in these also, as they are in Sheep,
Goat, and all Animals which cleave the hoof; but such Testicles as resemble
the Prostatae, or seed Glandules, and the Kennels of the Mesentery (whose
office is to secure the divarications of the Veins, and retain a moisture in
them whereby to keep the parts glib) rather then things designed to the
concoction of Prolifical seed, and the Reservation or treasuring it up till it
be fit for profusion in the time of Coition. And this is my opinion of them,
both for sundry reasons elsewhere alleged: as chiefly, because that at the
time of coition (when the males Testicles are swelled with seed, and full of
seminal juice) the Horns of the womb indeed are in Hindes and Does, and all
other Viviparous Animals (wherein they reside) much altered: but the Testicles,
as they call them, (like things utterly unconcerned in the matter of
Generation) do neither swell, nor differ any way from the constitution they
were of (either before, or after coition) affording no testimony at all of
their use either in respect of Coition, or Generation.

It is a wonderful thing to see how great a quantity of geniture does abound
in the Testicles, and much distended Seminal Vessels of the very masculine
Moles, and Mice, about the time of their coition (which we have also formerly
observed in the Dunghill-Cock) and how vast an alteration is espied in the
Genitals of both Sexes; and yet these Glandulae, or little Kernels (which men
conceive to be the Testicles of the Females) do still reserve their wonted
appearance, without any variation at all.

What we have hitherto observed, concerning the Womb and the Horns thereof in
Hindes and Does, does for the most part relate also to other Viviparous
Animals, though they differ in a Woman; because she conceives in her womb, but
all the rest in the Horns of the womb, except the Mare, and the she-Ass; and
even they also, though they seem to bear their Conception in the womb, yet that
place of Conception does more resemble the nature and constitution of a Horn,
then of a Womb: for that place is not bipartite, but something more oblong,,
and different from a womb, both in situation, connection, fabric, and
substance, and ought rather to be compared to the superior Uterus, or process
of the womb of the Hen, (wherein the Egg grows, and is encompassed with the
White) then to the womb of a Woman.

Of the Coition of the Hinds and Does.
EXER: LXVI.
THe History of the Womb of Hinds and Does, is such as has been showed.
Wherein we have briefly declared those things which did seem necessary to
Generation, namely, the place of Conception, and those parts which are ordained
thereunto. It remains that we now treat of the Action and Function of this
place, namely of Coition and Conception.

Hinds and Does do admit their Males at one only set time of the year; that is
about the midst of September, after the Feast of the Holy Cross, and they bring
forth after the midst of June, near the Feast of Saint John Baptist. So that
they go nine months, not eight, as Pliny would have it: L. 8. c. 32.
for they calve or bring forth, with us at lest, the nineth month after their
first Rutting.

At Rutting time the males assemble themselves amongst the females, but at
other times they feed apart: and the elder Dear (as the Staggs) do associate
with their own Sex, and the Hinds and Does keep company and feed among the
other Hinds and Does, together with the younger sort of Ducks, and Fawns. About
a whole month their Rutting time continues, which does begin later, if the
season be dry, but if it be moist and rainey, sooner. And therefore in Spain
(as I am informed) they seldom rut before the Calends of October, because moist
weather comes not on there til then. But in England their Rutting time seldom
lasts beyond the midst of October.

At that time their lust enrages them so, that they will assault or Dogs or
Men, when at other times they are shie and timorous, and suffer themselves to
be chased and put to flight upon the alarm of the least barking curre that is.

Every Male Deer knows all his Females, and will not endure any one of them to
straggle, but will pursue and bring her back to his Herd: and being now grown
very jealous of them, he frequently surveyes them, and rangeth them together.
And if perhaps a stranger Do intrude among them, he is not very passionate in
her expulsion, but affords her a fair departure: but if another Male Dear
address himself to this Herd, he bids him a speedy defiance, and charges him
with his Head.

The Hind and Do are numbered amongst the chaster rank of Animals; because
they do not willingly admit Coition (for the Stagge and Buck, like the Bull, do
celebrate their Coition with violence) and unless they be over-mastered, or
tired out with assaults, they shun the act. And this seems to be the cause of
the assembling themselves together in a Herd to their own proper mates, and
chiefly to those that are the elder Dear, and are best headed: for if a
forraigner attempt their chastity, they presently fly to their own Herd and
consort, for sanctuary, as the refuge of their affrighted modesty.

If a young Batchelour Buck find a Do straggling alone, he presently pursues,
and having tired her by his chasing, he takes advantage of her inability for
resistance, and so enjoyes her by force.

All the Male Deer provide themselves a Rutting place at some distance from the
Herd, by digging up trenches, or standing behind some convenient rise of
ground, whither they constrain their Females to appear. She that is now about
the act of Rutting, places her hinder feet in the furrow or trench provided
for the purpose, and (if occasion be) inclining her body does something depress
her Hanches; by which means the Stag or Buck may at one inition (as Bulls do)
pressing her forward, finish his affairs.

The Elder, and abler Stags, and Bucks have a larger Herd of Hinds and Does,
then the juniour and infirmer Deer: some assemble to themselves ten, some
fifteen. Our Keepers say, that the Females are sated at the second coition, or
third at the most, and she, so soon as she conceives, admits the male no more.

The Male when he has fructified all his Females, his lust cools; and having
impared both his audacity, and his flesh, quits his Herd, straggles alone, and
feeds greedily to repair his broken strength, making no farther assault upon
any Female all that year.

When the Buck grows first ripe for Rutting, the Hair about his Throat and
Neck grows black; as also does the extremity of his prepuce, which does
putrify likewise, and stink extremely.

The Does and Hinds are but very seldom compressed, and that too in the night
time only, and in obscure places, such as are purposely made choice of by the
Males for that performance. If the Stags or Bucks chance to contest (which is
usual) then the conquered his Females are all made the Victors purchase.

Of the Constitution or Alteration of the Uterus of the Hind and Do in the
month September.
EXERCIT. LXVII.
WE now come to the Alteration of the Geniral parts of the Hind, and Do, after
Rutting time, and also to the conception it self.

In September, when the Hinds and Does first Rutting time is now arrived, their
Uterus (I mean the Horns of the Uterus, or the place wherein they conceive) is
become more fleshy, and thick, and likewise more soft and tender. In the cavity
of each of the Horns of the womb (in that part which resembles a wrinckled
fillet; namely, where it reflects toward the spine of the Back) five
Caruncles, or soft Warts, or Nipples, do jet out, being placed in order:
whereof the first is the biggest of all, and the rest as they lie in order, are
still one less then the other; just as these Horns themselves do lessen by
degrees from the bottom upwards, to the very top. Some of these Caruncles do
grow out as broad as the middle finger, (appearing like a kind of a luxuriant,
fungous, fleshy substance) being paler or whiter then some, and more ruddy then
others.

About the six and twentieth, or eight and twentieth day of September (as
likewise afterward in October) the Uterus is grown thicker; and the caruncles
being now more tumid, do resemble the Nipples of Women's Breasts: so that you
would believe they were designed to yield Milk. Their top or uppermost part
being cut away (for I divided the outward superficies from them, to discover
their interior constitution) I beheld them compacted and formed out of an
innumerable company of white points, as out of so many bristles set up stiff
and erect, by a certain mucous viscidity or glewy substance, and pinching them
hard from the roots upward, between my fore finger and my thumb, I squeezed out
of each of those white points a small drop of blood. Whereupon by a more strict
enquiry, I discovered them to be nothing else, but the Capillary productions of
so many slender Arteries.

At Rutting time therefore, the Uterine Vessels (especially the Arteries) are
discovered to be more in number, and more conspicuous then at other times:
Though (as I have noted before) those that are called the Testicles, are
neither more large, nor more full then they were before, nor any thing changed
from their pristine constitution.

The Cavity of the Uterus (that is, of the Horns of the Uterus) and interior
superficies thereof (which you may call the wall of the little Cells) presents
it self exceeding soft and glibbe to the touch, like to the interior
concameration of the Ventricles of the Brain, or the flesh of the Nut of the
Yard, which is within the Prepuce. But in that Cavity, I could never discover
any Sperme ejected from the Male Dear, nor any other thing which relates to
the conception, (though I have made most accurate dissection through all the
entire months of September and October.) And yet the Male Dear did go to rut
daily, and I dissected a great number of Does. And this is the result of many
years experience.

I have seen indeed in some the Caruncles so nearly seated the one to the
other, as if they had made one continued protuberance out of all the five
united together. And when upon frequent experiment, I never met with any other
thing within the Cavity of the Uterus, I began at first to consider, whether
the masculine seed could by any means (namely either by way of Injection, or
Attraction) insinuate itself into the seat of Conception? and at last my many
repeated observations did ratify this conclusion, namely, that no part or
portion of the seed does ever enter into those receptacles.

What befalls them in the month of October.
EXERCIT. LXVIII.
HAving made several dissections in the month of October, as well before the
expiration of the Rutting time, as after: I could never find any seed, or
blood, or the track of any other thing whatsoever, in the cavity of the Uterus.
Only the Womb or Uterus was grown larger and thicker, and the Caruncles more
tumid and florid then before, and out of them upon a close constriction or
pinching them between the fingers, some small drops of blood did issue out, as
a watery kind of milk is expressed out of the nipples of the breasts of such
as are with Child, about the fourth month of their pregnation. In the Uterus
of one, or two, which was exceedingly impated and extenuated contrary to the
course of Nature, I found indeed a kind of a green, ichorous putrified
substance, like to impostumated matter, filling the cavity thereof; whereas
those very Does were in all other points sound, and something fat, no less then
their fellows which I diffected at the same time.

About the End of October, and the Beginning of November, when the Rutting time
is now concluded, and the Females and Males part company: the Uterus began to
seem of a lesser bulk (in some sooner, and in others later) and the wall or
sides of the inner cavity appeared to tumefie, as if it were puffed up; for in
those places where of late the little Cells were, there did now round gobbets
extuberate inwards, filling almost the whole capacity: so that the sides now
seemed to touch one another, and glewed as it were together, leaving no space
vacant between them. For as licorish Boys (while they plunder the honey-combs,
that they may greedily devour the honey) have their Lips so stung by the Bees,
that they swell and grow tumerous, and so streighten the gap of their Mouths;
in the same manner does the interior superficies of the Does Uterus become
turgid, and a most soft and pulpous substance (like that of the Brain) does
fill the cavity, and involve the Caruncles in it. And as for the Caruncles
themselves, they are no bigger then they were before, but only appear something
paler, and as it were maderated or stewed in warm water, as the Nurses nipples
look presently after the Child has had the breast. But I could not squeeze
out any blood from them, as before.

This interior superficies of the Uterus being thus swollen; it is at that time
so tender and smooth, as nothing can be more. It resembles the softness of the
brain it self, and when you touch it, did not your own eyes give evidence to
that touch, you would not believe your fingers vere upon it. The cavity of the
Womb being laid open immediately after the killing of the Dear, I have often
discovered a slow waving motion, (such a one as is seen in the bottom of a
creeping Snailes belly) as if the Womb were Animal in Animali, one living
creature in another; and had a peculiar independent motion of its own.

Such a kind of motion as this, I have (as I mentioned but now) often observed
in the intestines of creatures dissected alive: and the same may be
experimented both by the testimony of the sight and touch, in live Dogs and
Conies, though you dissect them not. I have likewise observed the same kind of
motion, in the Testicles and Scrotum of the Males; and I have known some Women,
whom such palpitations have deluded with the hopes of being with Child. But
whether in Hysterical affections (such as are the Ascent, descent, and
contortion of the Uterus) the Womb of Women move and stir by such a kind of
agitation; as whether the Brain also in its conceptions be in like manner
moved to and fro, as the discovery is very difficult, so is it vorthy the
attempt.

A little while after the foresaid Extuberance of the interior coat of the
Uterus begins to shrink, and lessen: and in some, (but that is rare,) a certain
purulent matter does stick to the fides, (in manner of sweat) such as is
visible in wounds, and ulcers, when they are said to be Concocted, and cast
forth a white, smooth, and equal matter. When I first discovered this kind of
substance, I was in suspense, whether I should conceit it to be the seed of the
Male, or some concocted substance arising from it. But because I did observe
this matter but seldom, and in few only, and also seeing twenty days were now
past, since any commerce with the male had been celebrated, and likewise for as
much as this substance was not thick, clammy, or froathy, (as seed is) but more
friable and purulent, inclining to yellow, I concluded that it arrived thither
casually rather, or else proceeded from over much sweat, the Dear being newly
quite spent in the chase: and so in a Rheum falling down into the Nose, the
thinner portion of the Catarrh being thickened into a mucous substance, puts on
a yellow complexion.

This alteration in the Womb when I had often discovered to His Majesty's sight
(as the first assay toward impregnation) and having likewise plainly showed
that all this while no portion of seed, or conception either was to be found in
the Womb; and when the King himself had communicated the same as a very
wonderful thing to diverse of his followers, a great debate at length arose:
The Keepers and the Huntsmen concluded, first, that this did imply, that their
conception would be late that year, and thereupon accused the drougth; but
afterward when they understood that the rutting time was past, and gone; and
that I stood stiffly upon that, they peremptorily did affirm, that I was first
mistaken my self, and so had drawn the King into my error; and that it could
not possibly be, but that something at lest of the Conception must needs appear
in the Uterus: until at last, being confuted by their own eyes, they sat down
in a gaze and gave it over for granted. But all the Kings Physicians persisted
stiffly, that it could no ways be, that a conception should go forward unless
the males seed did remain in the womb, and that there should be nothing at all
residing in the Vterus after a fruitful and effectual Coition; this they
ranked amongst their (...).

Now that this experiment which is of so great concern might appear the more
evident to posterity; His Majesty for tryal-sake (because they have all the
same time and manner of conception) did at the beginning of October separate
about a dozen Does from the society of the Buck, and lock them up in the Course
near Hampton Court. Now lest any one might affirm that doubtlessly these did
continue the seed bestowed upon them in Coition (their time of Rutting being
then not past) I dissected diverse of them, and discovered no seed at all
residing in their Vterus: and yet those whom I dissected not, did conceive by
the virtue of their former Coition (as by Contagion) and did Fawn at their
appointed time.

In Bitches, Conies, and several other Animals, I have certainly discovered,
that nothing after Coition is to be found in their Vterus, for many days
together. In so much that I am very well ascertained that in Viviparous, (as
well as in Oviparous creatures) the Foetus does neither proceed from the Seed
of Male and Female emitted in Coition, nor yet from any commixture of that
seed, (as the Physicians will have it) nor yet out of the Menstruous blood, as
Aristotle conceits; and likewise that there is not any thing of the conception
necessarily in being, presently after Coition. And hence it follows, that it is
not true, that in a prolifical coition, any matter is ready at hand in the
Vterus, which matter or substance, the Masculine seed should concoct, coagulate
and fashion, or reduce into an actual generation, or by drying its outward
Superficies, Form, and Afterbirth to wrap it in. For nothing at all is to be
found in the Womb for many days together, even to the twelfth of November.

It is also evident, that all Females, in the Act of coition, do not effund a
seed into the Vterus; for neither in Hinds, or Does, or several other
Viviparous Animals, is there any track or sign of either Seed, or Menstruous
blood. But what it may be, which flows from some salacious Women in Coition,
as well as from Men, which procures pleasure to them, and a kind of resolution
of their Spirits; as also whether it do necessarily conduce to the Conception;
likewise whether it do proceed from the Testicles, or whether it be seed, and
whether prolifical or not, we have elsewhere discovered.

And while I am in this discourse, let the ingenious bear with me, (if being
mindful of my great wrongs) I let slip a sigh or two, grounded upon this my
misfortune: namely, that while I did attend upon our late Sovereign in these
late distractions, and more then Civil Wars; (and that not by the Parliaments
bare permission, but command) some rapacious hand or other not only spoiled me
of all my Goods; but also (which I most lament) have bereft me of my Notes,
which cost me many years industry. By which meant, many observations
(especially those concerning) the Generation of Insects) are lost and
imberelled to the prejudice (I may boldly say it) of the Commonwealth of
Learning.

What things happen in the Uterus of Dear in November.
EXER. LXIX.
ABout the twelfth or fourteenth day of November there is something, which is
then first of all to be found in the Cavity of the Womb of the Dear, conducing
to the future foetus, and this I truly avouch, and of many years Experience.

I remember indeed, that in the year of our Lord 1653, these signs or rudiments
of conception did appear sooner, because it was a cloudy, and wet season. In
Hinds also, which go to Rut six or seven days before the Does, I have still
discovered some track of the future conception, about the eighth or nineth day
of November. But what that is, and how it does begin, I shall now declare.

A little before any thing at all is to be seen, the substance of the Vterus, or
Horns appear lesser, then when the females first went to Rut; and the white
Caruncles are more flaggy (as I informed you before;) and the protuberance of
the inward that does a little abate, growing more wrinckled, and moist. For
about the time aforesaid, some certain mucous filaments (like the Spiders
threads) are led from the last or upper angle of the Horns of the Vterus,
through the midst of both the Horns, and also through the cavity of the Womb,
which being joined together, do resemble a membra^^ns or filmy coat, or empty
wallet. And as that implication or web of vessels called Pleocus Choroides, ^^
led through the Ventricles of the Brain, so this little oblong sack, or wallet
is spun over all the space of both the Horns, and the intermediate cavity of
the womb. In which dissemination, insinuating it self into the rugosities of
the flagging membrane, it does insert slender fibers between the forementioned
round extuberances or nipples; after the same manner as the membrane called Fia
Matter does work it self into the convolutions of the brain.

A day or two being now over, this wallet is filled with a watery, white, stiff,
albugineous substance, and being stuffed with that moisture, does resemble a
long pudding, sticking or cleaving a little to the containing sides of the
Vterus by its exterior glutinosity; and yet so, that it may be easily
separated from them: for being taken in the narrow part of the Vterus (where it
is tied to it as it passes along) it may be brought away entire from both the
Horns, if it be warily handled.

This Conception now grown, and taken out, is of the figure of a wallet, or
double pudding: being besmeared on the outside with a kind of purulent filth;
but within it is glibbe, containing in it a stiff moisture, much like to the
more liquid White of an Egg.

Now this is the first Conception of Hindi and Does. And seeing the nature and
condition of an Egg, together with the definition is applicable thereto, for
Aristotle defines an Egg, to be that thing out of part whereof an Animal is
begotten, and Hist. an. l. 1. c. 5. and de genesis an. l. 2. c. 1. de genesis an. l.
3. c. 9.
the remainder is the food of that Animal which is begotten: and likewise,
seeing it is the groundwork or rudiment of the future foetus, it is therefore
also called Ovum Animalium, the Animals Egg, According to that of Aristotle.
Those creatures which beget an Animal within themselves, have upon the first
conception something formed in them in manner of an egg. For a moist substance
is contained in a Membrane, just as if you should pill off the shell from the
Egg: whereupon the depravations of these conceptions are called fluxes. This
Conception therefore, as we said before of an Egg, is a true sperme, or seed,
embracing in it self the virtue of both Sexes, and proportionable to the seed
of Plants. Aristotle therefore describing the first Conceptions of Women, Hist.
an. l. 7. c. 7.
says they are, as it were, an Egg covered over with a Membrane, but the shell
taken off: such as Hippocrates records to have dropped from the Minstrel, and
such as I have often seen fallen from Women in the second Month, which was of
the bigness of a Pige^^ egg, without any foetus at all in it: and sometimes
about the bulk of a Pheasants, or Hens egg: and at this time the floating
Embryo is of the longitude of the nail of the Litle-finger. But the Membrane
involving the Conception, has not yet attained any After-burden to which it
may be fastened, nor is it fastened to the womb it self; but only at its
obtuser and upper end, as if it were ^^uck with moss or down; it presents to
our view the first designs and rudiments of the After-burden, or Cake of the
Womb: but the inner superficies being smooth and glib, is divaricated with the
several propagations of the Umbilical Vessels. At the third Month, this Egg
exceeds a Goose-Egge in magnitude, and infolds within it an Embryo of the
length of two transverse fingers. At the fourth Month, it is larger then the
Egg of an Ostrich. And thus much I have diligently observed in Abortions,
having made several dissections of them.

And in this manner do Hinds and Does, though for a whole month together (and
more) after their Rutting time, no sensible thing at all be contained in their
uterus, produce by a kind of Contagion, these conceptions and rudiments in the
shape of eggs, (as Plants bring forth their seed, and Trees their fruit) which
about the eighteenth or one and twentieth day of November (at the farthest) are
complete; and that sometimes in the Right Horn, and sometimes in the Left, and
at other times in both: having in them a certain dissolved substance,
transparent, and crystalline (which we call the Colliquamentum, or Eye in the
Hen-egg) which is contained in a proper thin orbicular coat of their own, being
much purer then that humor wherein the Conception swims afterward; in the
midst whereof the sanguineous fibers, and the Punctum saliens (which is the
first foundation of the future foetus) without the presence of any thing else,
are clearly discerned; and this is the first Genital particle. Which being
constituted, not only the Vegetative soul, but the Motive also is said to be
in it, from which all the other parts of the foetus are each in their order
generated, formed, disposed, and endowed with life: after the same manner as we
have declared the Chicken to be constituted out of the Colliquamentum of the
Egg.

Both these humors are in the Conceptions of all Viviparous Animals; which many
men conceive to be the Excrements of the Foetus, deeming the one to be its
urine, the other its sweat; when notwithstanding they have no offensive taste
at all, and are always most manifest in the Conception, even before any
particle of the foetus is discerned.

The Outward coat which embraces both the humors, is called Chorion; the
Inward, Amnium. And more then these two you can never find; the former,
involving the whole Conception, and extended over both the Horns of the uterus;
the later, swimming in the first water, and contained only in one of the
Horns, except there be a Twin-foetus; in which case, there is one in each of
the Horns: as in the Gemellifical Egg there are two Colliquamentums. So that
where there is a double foetus, they are both contained in one and the same
conception, together with their twofold crystalline waters: (as in one and the
same Egg.) If you make an incision into any part of the Exterior membrane, the
more impure water will presently issue out from both the Horns; but the
crystalline water, which is comprehended in the interior membrane called
Amnion, does not flow forth with the former, unless you have peirced it also.

The Vein, which is first seen within the Amnion, in the crystalline humor,
takes its original from the Punctum saliens; exercising the office, and
partaking of the nature of the Umbilical Vessels; and being by degrees
enlarged, it is disseminated into other ramifications, which are scattered into
the Colliquamentum: whereby it is most evident, that the nutriment is at first
attracted from the Colliquamentum only, wherein the Foetus swims.

Having dissected the uterus, I have exposed this Punctum saliens, while it yet
continued its palpitation, to the view of our late dread Sovereign; which was
then so small, that without the advantage of the Sunbeams obliquely
illustrating it, he could not have perceived its shivering motion.

The entire Colliquamentum being cast into a silver or tinn-Bason, which is
full of clear warm water, does very neatly lay open the Punctum saliens to the
eye. To which, in the following days, a certain gelly, like a little worm, in
the form of a Magot, is adjoined, (as being the first platform of the future
body) divided into two parts; of one part whereof the Trunk is constituted, and
the Head of the other: in the very same manner, as has been formerly delivered
in the History of the Hen-egg. The Spine of the Back is a little inflected in
manner of a Keel; the Head is imperfectly composed of three small vesicles, or
little balls, and swimming in the Crystalline water, does daily enlarge, and
grow into shape: With this difference only, that the Eyes are much larger, and
more visible in Oviparous, then in Viviparous productions.

After the six and twentieth day of November, the foetus is discerned, having
his whole body almost complete, being found without distinction, sometimes
seated in the Right, and sometimes in the Left horn of the Vterus: but where
there is a Twinfoetus, there is one of them placed in each of the Horns.

And at this time the Male is distinguishable from the Female by his Genital
parts; which are conspicuous in a humane Embryo, so soon as ever the rough
Artery does appear.

You shall find the Male and Female sometimes in the Right, and sometimes in
the Left horn, merely as it falls out. But yet the Male is more frequently
discovered in the Left, and the Female in the Right horn, and this frequently
in Does, which have Twins within them, and I once also observed it in an Ewe.
Whence I am confirmed, that the proper constitution, or peculiar virtue of
either side, does signify nothing to the discrimination of the Sex. Nor is the
uterus the Fabricatour or former of the Foetus, no, nor the mother her self,
any more then the Hen is the framer of the Chicken in the Egg whereon she
sits. But as the Chicken is made in the Egg by an internal formative Agent,
so likewise is the foetus constituted out of this Egg of the Do.

A man would admire to see the Foetus formed and completed in the Amnion, in
so small a time after the first rise and beginning of the Blood and Punctum
saliens. For about the nineteenth or twentieth day of November, that Point
makes his first appearance: about the one and twentieth or two and twentieth
day, the little unshapen Worm or Maggot discovers it self: but within six or
seven days after that, the Foetus is so complete, that you may distinguish the
Male from the Female, (by the Genital parts) and perceive the feet formed, and
the little hoofes cleft, being then like Gelly, something inclining to yellow.

So soon as ever the foetus begins to be formed and grow, the substance of the
Uterus is much extenuated: contrary to the custom of it in Women, whose Womb
according to the increase of the Foetus becomes thicker, and more fleshy. For
in Hinds, and Does, how much the more the foetus augmenteth, so much the Horns
of the Uterus approach nearer to the shape of the Guts: and chiefly that Horn,
wherein the Foetus does reside, does resemble a little wallet, though in its
extent and capacity it exceed the other.

This Egg or Conception, does as yet on no side adhere, or grow fast to the
Matrix (though the foetus is now complete) but may be very easily drawn away
whole; as I have tried it in an Ewe, which bore a foetus in her Womb, almost
the length of my Thumb. Wherefore it is most apparent, that the foetus is yet
only nourished by the White, which is shut up with it in the Conception, as it
has been observed in the Hen-egge before; for the Orifices of the Umbilical
Vessels are quite obliterated between the White of the Conception, and the
adjacent humors with their membranes; not being any where as yet fastened to
the Uterus it self, though those Veins or Vessels only are the convoy to
administer nourishment to the foetus. And as in an Egg the propagations of the
Veins are first disseminated into the Colliquamentum; (as the roots of plants
are into the ground) and are afterward communicated to the exterior Membrane
(called the Chorion) and do dispatch their branches up and down with
innumerable divarications through the albugineous humor contained in the
utmost membrane, that so they may forage, and provide Aliment: so likewise in
humane abortions, I have plainly discovered the vein in the Chorion; and
Aristotle himself affirmed, that that coat was full Hist. an. l. 7. c. 7.
of veins.

If there be a single foetus, the distribution of its Umbilical vessels is
extended to both the Horns of the Womb (having little branches disseminated
through the cavity thereof) that so it may attract aliment on both sides. But
if there be two (namely one in each Horn) they both shoot forth their
Umbilical propagations into that part only of the Conception which borders
upon their proper Horn: so that the foetus seated in the right Horn deriveth
his sustenance from the right side of the conception, and he in the left from
the left only: The Gemellifical conception being in all other matters also
like the Gemellifical Egg.

Now, about the end of November, all the parts are clear and distinct, and the
foetus now appears of the magnitude of a large Bean, or a Nutmeg: the hinder
part of his Head being a little prominent, as it is in a Chicken, but his Eyes
are less. His Mouth lies gaping wide even from Ear to Ear: for the Cheeks and
Lips are last of all perfected, as being cutaneous parts. So that in all
Productions (even in humane also) the slit of the Mouth is dilated as far as
the Ears on both sides, having neither Lips nor Cheeks to abate it. And for
this cause, as I conceive, many are born with cleft lips, (we call them
Hare-lips, that is, having such lips as Hares, and Camels have) because in the
formation of the humane foetus, the upper lips do very slowly close.

I have often times cast the foetus, when it was now grown to the quantity of a
fair Bean, being transparent under his coat Amnios, and swimming in his most
pure alinient, into a silver basin full of the clearest water, whereby I
discovered chiefly these most remarkable following things. His brain being of a
little thicker consistence then the White of an Egg, (like milk a little
coagulated) of a rude shape, lies encompassed on every side in a membrane,
having as yet no scull at all. The After-brain stands up something prominent,
as in a Chicken. The Cone or whole frame of the Heart looks white, and so also
all the other Bowels (even the Liver it self) are white, and as it were
spermatical. The Trunk of the Umbilical Vessels does arise from the heart, and
passing the gibbous part of the Liver, does insert it self into the Trunk of
the Vena Porta, or Gate Vein; and running thence a little farther, and
distinguishing it self into several propagations, it is diffused through the
colliquamentum, and the coat called Chorion, by an infinite number of branches.
The Sides on both hands arise from the spine, so that the Thorax or chest looks
like a boat, or little pinnace, before the Heart and Lungs are retired into its
circuit: just in like manner as it is in the chicken. For the Guts, Heart, and
the rest of the Bowels are very conspicuous, and seem to be little appendixes of
the body; until at last the chest and coverture of the lower Belly are drawn
over them (as the Roof is erected upon the open rooms) and so veil and
conceal them. At that time the sides as well of the Breast, as the Loins, seem
to be white, mucilagineous, and of a similar constitution, excepting only that
through the inside of the Breast, some certain slender capillary lines do run
along, and so occasion a distinction between the future Ribs, and the carnous
or fleshy parts of the sides.

I have also sometimes seen the Twinne-foetus in the Conceptions of Ewes, which
have been about the same time whereof we now speak (and sometimes one alone)
which were of the longitude of a transverse finger: their form was like that of
the smallest Lizard, and their magnitude like that of a Waspe, or Worm called
Eruca: the Spine of the back was bent round, so that the head did almost reach
to the tail. Both of them did swim in a peculiar clear humor of their own,
enclosed within the Amnion: and both were of the same magnitude, (as if they
had been begotten at one and the same act of coition and conception) For though
the one lay in the right, and the other in the left Horn, yet both were
included in the same wallet, and in the same exterior water: (and so
consequently in the same egg, or conception.) Their mouths were wide, but
their eyes were small, and scarce discernable points; contrary to those of
Birds. Their Bowels or Intrals also were not as yet enclosed within the cavity
of the body, but were hanging out. Their Exterior Membrane called Chorion, did
not adhere to the Uterus, so that I could not take away the conception whole
and entire. There were also in the same coat an infinite number of Umbilical
propagations which had no connection at all to the Uterus: as we have noted in
Deer also, and after the same manner, as we have described them in the outward
membrane of the Hen-egge. There were only present two humors, and as many
coats containing them: whereof the exterior called Chorion was extended over
both the Horns, and being full of a more turbid humor, did fashion or shape
the egg, or conception. But the coat called Amnios, was almost invisible (like
that coat of the Eye which is called Arachnoides, or the Cobweb, being the
membrane of the Crystalline humor) containing in it a clear bright Water like
Crystal, wherein this foetus of the Ewe did swim.

The humor contained within the Chorion, was in proportion a hundred times
more (I might say a thousand) then the other, though the Crystalline humor too
which is reserved in the Amnios, was in a larger quantity, then to be suspected
for the Sweat of so small a foetus swimming amidst it. Nor was it of any
distastful savor, or sent, but exceeding clear: and (as we have noted in Hinds
and Does) resembling thin watery milk, being tainted with no kind of
excrementitious pravity. Now in case this humor were an Excrement, it would
also grow and increase as the foetus it self does: But I find the matter clean
contrary in the foetus of the Ewe also; for a little before it is ^aned, there
is scarce any portion of this humor left. Wherefore I conceive it rather to be
the Aliment, then the Excrement of the Foetus.

The Interior coat of the Ewes womb was imbossed with an infinite number of
caruncles, (as the Sky is with stars) which were of the likeness of Crabbs
eyes, as I call them, but something less; and resembling loose or hanging
warts, were glandulous, and white, sticking within the coats of the womb, being
something hollow or excavated on that side wherewith they incline toward the
Conception: (contrary to their course in Hinds and Does, in which they do
extuberate toward the Foetus it self) and besides all this, they did strut
with blood; and their interior superficies, as it did direct it self toward
the conception, was full of black, sanguineous points. The Umbilical Vessels of
the Foetus were not as yet inserted into these caruncles, nor was the
conception hitherto fastened to the Uterus.

As for that coat, which they talk much of, and call Allantoides, I can find
no such matter in the conceptions of Ewes; but afterward (when the foetus is
now grown bigger) when the Egg or Conception does now cleave to the Uterus,
and the veins are inserted into the caruncles, then is the Chorion extended
farther, and in its two ends (or Appendixes as it were) a certain humor died
yellow (you would conceive it to be an excrementitious humor) is secluded, and
reserved apart from the rest.

As for a Humane Conception, that hardly differs any thing from an Egg, for the
first months. For before the Afterbirth or Uterine cake has been framed, I
have seen a white humor (like to the thinner White of the Egg, and equal in
magnitude to a Pigeons egg, nay sometimes to a Pheasants) encompassed in a
slender membrane; wherein the Embryo, who was as long as the nail of the
little finger, did appear like a small frogge: having a broad body, a wide
mouth, and his arms and legs newly shot forth, like the young buds of
flowers: he had a prominent Occiput, or After-braine, which may be rather
called a little bladder annexed like an appendix to the rest of the head, as
has been mentioned in the first rudiment of the Occiput of chickens.

An other humane Conception I saw (which was about fifty days standing)
wherein was an egg, as large as an Hen-egg, or Turkey-egg. The foetus was of
the longitude of a large Bean, with a very great head, which was over-looked by
the Occiput, as by a crest; the Brain it self was in substance like Coagulated
milk; and instead of a solid scull, there was a kind of Leather-membrane, which
was in some parts like a gristle, distributed from the forehead, to the Roots
of the Nose. The Face appeared like a Dogs snout. Without both Ears, and Nose.
Yet was the rough Artery, which descends into the Lungs, and the first rudiment
of the Yard, visible. The two deaf-ears of the Heart, appeared like two black
eyes.

In a Woman with child, who dyed of a Fever, I found an Hermaphrodite Embryo
of almost the same bigness. Its Privity was like that of a Cony, the labra
resembling the prepuce; and the Nymphae, the Glans or Nut. Above this privity I
saw the first rudiments of a Yard, to which there hung down on both Sides,
instead of Testicles, the laxe or flaggy skin of the Scrotum, or Cod. Its
Uterus or womb. was very little, resembling the Uterus of an aborted Lamb, or
Mole, having both the Horns. And as the Glandules or Kernels, called Prostatae,
were situate near the Yard, so also were the Testicles, which were of a
discernable magnitude, placed next to those Horns. So that, according to
outward appearance, it did most express a Male child, but upon inward
discovery of the Parts, a Female. The womb of the woman that bare it, was very
vast, having the bladder of Urine adjoined to it (as its Appendix:) but
contrariwise in the Foetus, the Bladder of Urine was large, and the Uterus
looked only like its Appendix.

All these forementioned humane Conceptions, like the Ewes, had a rough or
wrinckled superficies outwardly, and were dawbed over with a kind of Gelly, or
glutinous substance; and at that time, there was neither any appearance of the
After-burden, nor yet any union of the Conception to the matrix, nor any
insertion of the Umbilical Vessels into the matrix, or womb, though they were
disseminated into the superficies of the Conception.

Though diverse foetus are sometimes found in the same Conception of Hindes,
and Does, (as diverse Chickens in the same white of a gemellifical Egg) as it
also happens in Ewes, she-Goats, and other cloven footed creatures: yet in
Bitches, Conies, Sowes, and other Viviparous and Multiparous Animals, the
matter is clean otherwise; for every foetus in them does challenge two several
humors, and two distinct coats.

In Bitches there are several Knots through the whole cavity of the Horns of
their uterus, in which so many several humors are contained, and in every one
of them a several Foetus. In the Hare, and Cony which are Does, you may
perceive many round gobbets or balls (such as the eggs of Serpents are) like
bracelets made of several Amber beads.

The Hares Conception is exceeding like an Acorn, and the After-burden covers
it in manner of a Cup; and the Humors contained in the membranes hang down
like little Acorns.

Of the manner how the Conception of Hindes, and Does, is found to be in the
month of December.
EXER. LXX.
IN the beginning of December, the Foetus is now more grown and perfect, being
of a fingers length. The Heart, and other Bowels, together with the Guts (all
which were formerly exposed to public view) are retreated into the hollow of
the body; so that you can neither discern them, nor the motion of the Heart,
without dissection.

The Conception or Egg, by the mediation of the five Caruncles in each Horn,
(formerly spoken of) is in five several places adjoined and fastened to the
Uterus, yet not so firmly neither, but that a small force will disjoin them
again. Which being done, you shall discern the different print of the Caruncles
in the outward superficies of the Chorion, by which Caruncles it was united to
the Uterus, the impression which they leave behind them being rugged and
viscous, as if by that glue or paste, the said adhesion or conjunction had been
effected. And thus have we revealed the Nature and use of these Caruncles; for
they which before (like Warts or Mushroms) were bred at the sides of the
Uterus, do now, being knit to the conception, supply the place and office of an
After-burden, or Uterine Cake (as it is in Women) namely, they are instead of
so many nipples from which the foetus by the assistance of his Umbilical
Vessels does derive to himself such Aliment as his Mother affords him: as shall
appear hereafter.

The Magnitude and capacity of the Vterus (under which name we understand the
Horns of the Vterus; namely the places of conception) do enlarge according to
the growth of the foetus, but yet so, that, that Horn wherein the foetus
setleth his abode, is larger then the other.

Their conception or egg is one only; whether they produce a single, or
diverse Foetus: and that single conception is dilated over both the Horns; so
that it looks like a brace of puddings, or rather like one only, and that tied
in the middle, as has been formerly said: for passing along slender, and
round, from the farthest part of the Horn on one side, it does by degrees
enlarge, and so goes on to that common place, which in a Woman we call the
Womb and Matrix or Mother; (because a Woman in that part is made a Mother, by
conceiving and fostering a foetus in it) where it is straightened as if it
passed through an Isthmus; and being again dilated, as it arriveth at the other
Horn, it proceeds still on to the farthest extremity thereof likewise; where
growing less, and pointed (as it did at the beginning) it erects its non Vltra,
and proceeds no farther. Therefore these kind of conceptions, if they be drawn
away entire, do resemble a wallet whose both ends are full of Water: and thence
also that coat chorion, is likewise called Allantoides; because the conceptions
of such Animals resemble a Gut blown up, or stuffed pudding, which is tied fast
in the midst.

If you dissect an Embryo at this time, you shall discern all the interior
parts distinct, and complete: but chiefly the Stomach, the Heart, and Kidneys,
and the Lungs; which are also divided into their Lobes, and look as they had
blood in them, having gained their just form. But the complexion of these Lungs
is more ruddy, then of those which have at any time breathed; because the Lungs
stretched and dilated by the Air, put on a whiter color. And by this
observation of the different complexion, you may discover whether a Mother
brought her Child alive or dead into the world; for instantly after
inspiration the Lungs change color: which color remains, though the foetus
dye immediately after.

In a Female foetus, the Testicles (improperly so called) are seated near the
Kidneys, in the hanging or loose ligament of the uterus, or womb, at the ends
or extremities of the Horns on both sides; and are for their proportion larger
in a foetus, then in a grown body, and look white, like the caruncles.

In the Stomach of the Foetus, there is found a watery substance, (not unlike
that wherein he (swims) but something more troubled, and less transparent: like
to that milk which is dreined out of Women's breasts, that are about four or
five months gone, or like white Posset as we call it.

In the upper Guts there is store of chyle made of the foresaid substance now
concocted. But in the Colon or colic Gut there do begin to appear yellow
excrements, and shaped.

But as for the Urachus (or Perforation of the Navel of the foetus, by which it
is imagined to discharge the urine into the coat called Allantoides) I find no
such matter; nor any difference at all between the coat Allantoides (which is
supposed to contain the urine) and the Chorion; nor do I discover any urine in
the Afterbirth, but only in the Bladder, and in that, good store: the Bladder
it self, being something Oblong, is situate between the Umbilical Arteries,
which arise from the branches of the descending Trunk of the Great Artery.

The Liver is rude, and almost inform or unshapen, as if it were something
besides Natures intention, it looks only like a ruddy affusion of Blood. The
Brain being now somewhat reduced into shape, is comprehended in a thick
membrane. The Eyes lie concealed under the lids; and those lids are so starched
together, and shut so fast (as it is with puppies newly whelped) that I had
much ado to disjoin them, and open the eyes. The Breast Bone and Ribs do now
harden by degrees: and the complexion of the Muscles shifts from white, to be
blood colored.

Having made very many several dissections for the whole course of this Month,
I am become more assured, that the caruncles before mentioned, do exercise the
office of an Afterbirth or Uterine cake; which I now discerned to be red and
swelled, and about the bigness of a Wall-nut. The Conception, which, as we
said, did before stick only to the caruncles by the help of the glutinous
substance, does now dispatch the little branches of the Umbilical Vessels into
the very body of the caruncles (as Plants work in their Roots into the earth)
by which it is fastened, and grows to the Womb.

About the end of December I have feen the foetus being then about a span long,
lustily bestirring himself, and kicking; opening his mouth and jaws, and also
shutting them again. His hear^ was now placed in its purse, or pericardium, and
the Breast being dissected, it was very discernable making apparent and
forcible Palpitations; and yet the Ventricles of the Heart were Uniform, and
of equal magnitude, and did consist of equal height, or of a double cone: the
thickness also of their sides was equal. Where also I clearly discerned the
deaf ears of the Heart, which at this time were full of blood, like two pretty
large bladders, to continue and persist in their motion for a little space,
even when the Heart it self had resigned it up.

All the Bowels, which were indeed perfect before, are now larger and more
conspicuous. The Scull is partly cartilagineous, and partly bony. The Hoofs are
yellowish, flexile, and soft (just as the Hoofs of grown Dear are, being
mollified in seething water) the Caruncles, now very great, (as large
Mushroomes) are spread over the whole cavity of the Uterus, and do evidently
supply the use of an Afterbirth: for several propagations and those large ones
too, are from the Umbilical Vessels disseminated into them, that so they may
derive aliment to the foetus: in like manner as in those that are already in
the world, the chyle is transported by the Meseraick branches into the Gate
vain of the Liver.

In whatsoever Conception of this kind, there is but one only foetus, there
the Umbilical vessels are conveied to all the caruncles: (as well of the
opposite, as the same side) but in that conception where there is a double
foetus, there the ramifications of the Vmbilical vessels relating to each
foetus, are not propagated beyond the caruncles of the same side wherein it
resideth.

The lesser Vmbilical veins as they respect the foetus, do where they unite and
join together determine and end in other greater Veins; and those again passing
farther on, and uniting, do conclude in Veins yet greater then themselves, till
at the last they constitute two truncks, which being conjoined, do convey Blood
into the Hollow, and Gate Vein. But the Vmbilical Arteries (arising from the
branches of the descending Trunk of the great Artery.) are two, and those very
small ones, and such as were it not for their pulse, could scarce be discerned,
which being carried along, to the capacity or superficies of the conception)
where the caruncles or Afterbirth meet the propagations of the Veins) do first
diminish or lessen into capillary threads, and at last become quite invisible,
and are clean expunged.

As in the Vterus the Extremities of the Vmbilical vessels are terminated into
the caruncles, so likewise out of the Vterus, the Vterine vessels (which are
many, and large) carrying blood from the Mother to the Womb (by the conduct of
the suspensory ligaments) do terminate outwardly in those very caruncles. We
are also to take notice, that the Interior vessels, are all of them Veins, for
the most part: but the Exterior are for the most the propagations of Arteries.
In the Woman's Afterburden, if you mind it well, presently after she is
delivered, are many more Arteries then Veins, and also larger too, which are
disseminated with almost innumerable propagations up and down, even to its
utmost superficies. As also in the fungous Parenchyma, or Affusion of the
Spleen, which is not unlike it, the number of the Arteries exceeds that of
the Veins.

The exterior Vterine vessels do, as I say, tend toward the Matrix, and
toward the Testicles, which are seated in the suspensory ligament; as some men
imagine.

In the Gibbous or unequal part of the caruncles, which respect the Matrix, I
have observed a wonderful contrivance in Nature: For in diverse of the
Cavities, and Cotyledones, or Orifices of the vessels gaping outward, I found
a white mucilaginous substance, which did fill up the whole body of the
caruncle, (as the Honey stuffs up the Honeycomb) and was of a complexion,
consistence, and taste much like the White of an Egg. But if you pluck a sunder
the conception from the caruncles, you shall presently descry so many spriggs,
or capillary branches of the Vmbilical vessels (which look like long threads or
filaments) to be drawn out also from every one of the Cotyledones, and Combs as
it were, and out of their mucous substance: just as Herbs plucked up from the
Earth, have their Roots trailing after them.

By which it is evident, that the Extremities of the Vmbilical vessels, are no
way conjoined to the Vterine vessels by an Anastomosis; nor do extract blood
from them, but are terminated in that white mucilaginous matter, and are quite
obliterated in it, attracting nourishment from it; after the self same manner,
as they did formerly draw Aliment from the white moisture or sap, which was
concluded within the membranes of the conception. And as the chicken in the
Hen-egge is sustained by the White attracted by its Vmbilical vessels; so the
Conception also of Hinds and Does, is nourished with a white substance like to
that, which is stored up in these little Cells, and not with blood.

Wherefore these Caruncles may be justly styled the Vterine cakes, or dugs:
that is to say, Convenient and proportionate Organs or Instruments designed for
the concocting of that Albuginous Aliment, and for preparing it for the
attraction of the Veins. And therefore those Viviparous Animals which have not
these Caruncles or Afterbirth; (as the Mare, and the Sow have none) their
foetus is sustained even till the hour of their birth, with the humors which
are contained in the Conception only; and their conception does no where
adhere or grow to the Vterus.

It is therefore manifest in those, and also in these sorts or species of
Viviparous Animals, (and perhaps in all other whatsoever;) that the Embryo is
in no other manner sustained in the Vterus, then the chicken in the Egg; but
out of the same Nutritive substance, and of like kind to the Aliment in the
White of an Egg. For as in an Egg, the extremities of the Vmbilical vessels
are terminated in the White and Yolk: so likewise in Hinds and Does, and other
Animals, that are furnished with these Caruncles, the extremity of the Orifices
of the Vmbilical vessels are opened into, and terminated in the humor which is
contained in the Conception; and in that white substance, which is found in
those Orifices or Cotyledones.

And this truth is hence also asserted, in that the extremities of the threads
or filaments of the Vmbilical vessels, when they are drawn out of that mucous
or white substance, are all of them white likewise; which is a forcible
argument they do only imbibe this gelly or mucilage, and not blood. And any
man may prove the same Experiment in an Egg also, if he desire it.

The After-burden, or Vterine cake of a Woman, is in its gibbous part,
wherewith it respects the Womb, uneven, and hilly, by reason of several tumors
or mushroom-like substances; and seems by their mediation to grow to the Womb.
As if it were not fastened to the womb in every part, but only in those places,
where the vessels disseminated into it do extract Aliment, and in which for
that cause, the extremities of the vessels are broken off. Now whether those
extremities or terminations of the vessels do suck blood from the Womb, or
rather some kind of concocted substance like to the White of an Egg, such as
we perceive plainly in Hinds, and Does, I am not yet satisfied.

Lastly, (that the truth in hand may be certainly confirmed) if you squeeze
those caruncles between your fingers; you may easily Milk as much of that
Nutritive juice as a spoon can contein, out of any one of those Caruncles; (as
out of a Nipple) without any appearance of blood at all; which blood you shall
never squeez from them though you force them never so much. Moreover, the
caruncle thus milked and drained, does contract it self, and flag, like to a
sponge that is squeezed, and appears to be bored through with several
perforations. So that by all signs and tokens it appears that those Caruncles
are Ubera Vterina, the Breasts or Vdders of the Uterus, or the receptacles and
storehouses of that Nutritive white substance.

At the end of December, these Caruncles do less firmly cleave to the Vterus,
then they did before, and are with case divided from it. And by how much the
foetus does improve, and grow nearer to the birth, so much the easier do those
caruncles disjoin from the Womb: and in the end (as ripe fruit falls off from
the Tree) they depart from the Vterus of their own accord, as being things
which relate to the conception.

And when they are parted from the Womb, you may, in the impressions which they
leave behind them, perceive the points or terminations of the Arteries which
pass on toward them, breathing forth blood. But if you force the conception
from the caruncles, no blood does issue out from the impressions which they
leave behind them: though it do seem more consonant to reason, that blood
should issue out of the caruncles, then of the conception upon their divorce.
For since the caruncles are embroidered by several propagations of Arteries
derived from the Vterus; and are commonly conceived to convey blood for the
nutriment of the Foetus, they ought in consequence to abound with plenty of
Blood. And yet though you milk or compress them, they effund no blood at all;
because they are not full of blood, but of this white substance; nor do they
seem to be instruments instituted for the concoction of the former, but
Promptuaries, or Treasuries of the latter. By which it is apparent, that the
foetus in the Womb, is not sustained by the Mothers blood, but by this white
substance fitly prepared. And perhaps even grown bodies are not nourished by
blood, but something which runs in the blood, is their common and last Aliment:
as shall perhaps be elsewhere discovered in our Physiological Treatise, and in
the proper disceptation relating to the blood.

I do much question the truth of that place of Hippocrates, where he says:
Those Animals whose L. de not. Mul. de morb. vulg. and Sect. 5. and aphor. 45.
Acetabula or Orifices of their Vterine vessels are full of a mucous substance,
do suffer Abortment. For that substance is not an Excrement, and cause of
Abortion, but an Aliment and first cause of life. But Hippocrates perhaps meant
some other Acetabula: for in a Woman they are not found, nor has her
Afterbirth any such substance as this to be sensibly perceived in any of its
cavities.

The Later Physicians, according to the opinion of the Arabians, do fancy
three several Nutritive Humors; namely, Rorem, the dewy substance, Gluten, the
glutinous substance, and Cambium, the substance which is immediately
transformed into the essence of the parts: and these Fernelius calls succos
Nutritios, the alible juices; as conceiving, that the Parts of our bodies are
not immediately nourished by the Blood, as its last aliment, but by these
secundary humors: by the first whereof, as by a kind of Dew, all the smallest
particles of the body and parts thereof, are sprinkled and bedewed; which
humor being thickened by a farther concoction, and sticking more firmly to the
Parts, is now called Gluten, which at last being altered and assimilated by the
power and virtue of the Parts, is called Cambium.

We may, according to these Men's conceit, call that substance which we find in
the Acetabula, or Orifices of the vessels, the Gluten, or Nutritive white, and
say that it is (as being the last Aliment which is designed to all the several
parts of the foetus) proportionable to the White or Yolk of the Egg. For as we
said ere-while, with Aristotle, that the Yolk is proportionable to milk: so we
likewise conceive it consonant to reason, to affirm, that this substance, which
is contained in the Cotyledones, or Acetabula of the Uterine cake, does supply
the office of milk to the foetus, so long as it continues in the womb: and
consequently, that the Caruncles are as it were Ubera interna, internal Dugs,
and that the alible juice is (after the delivery) transported into the Breasts,
and there made milk; that so the foetus may enjoy the same nutriment after he
is born, wherewith he was fed when he continued in the womb. And therefore this
only difference is between the party-colored Eggs of Oviparous Animals (which
are compounded of the Yolk and White) and the Eggs or Conceptions of Viviparous
Animals, that in the former, the Yolk (which is their secundary sustenance) is
provided for them within the Egg, and presently upon their Exclusion, is shut
up within the belly of the Chicken, as being reserved there for their support;
but in the latter, this nutritive substance is before the Birth preserved in
the Acetabula, and after the Birth transmitted to the Breasts or Udder. So that
the Pullus is supplied with a kind of milk, which is concluded in it self;
but the Viviparous foetus, sucks the same from the duggs of the Dam.

When December is ended, seeing that in the subsequent months of January,
February, etc. there is nothing new or notable does befall the foetus, but all
its accessions have been observed already, (save only the Hair, Teeth, Horns,
and the like) only the parts formerly described seem to have attained a larger
Augmentation, little or nothing respecting the business of Generation, we
conceive it useless to discourse any more of them at present.

But as to the Conceptions of Ewes, I have dissected diverse of them about this
time, which (like those of Does) did also resemble the figure of a Wallet, or
double-pudding, being extended over both the Horns of the Womb. In some of
these Conceptions I found two foetus; in other, one only, and that void of all
kind of wool, with its eyes so congealed and fixed together, that I could not
open the lids, and yet the hoofs were already made. Where there were two
foetus, they lay in several Horns of the Uterus, and that promiscuously,
without any order at all observed, the male being sometimes in the left, and
the female in the right Horn, and sometimes clean contrary: but both were still
encompassed in the same common Conception, and concluded in the same exterior
membrane called Chorion; whose Extremities or ends on both Sides toward the
termination of the Horns, were stained as it were by a kind of cholerical
excrement, and did seem to have some turbid and excrementitious matter within
them.

The Caruncles, or little Cakes, were diverse, and of a different magnitude, and
of a distinct figure from the caruncles of Hinds and Does: for in Ewes, there
is a kind of round mushroom with the stalk broken off, contained between the
Coats of the Uterus, whose gibbous Part lies toward the Uterus; (as it is
also in the Conceptions of Cowes) but the concave (which is smooth) toward the
foetus: and likewise larger Branches or Vessels are derived to this concave
part, as it also happens to the interior part of a Woman's After-burden.

The Propagations of the Umbilical Vessels being annexed to the caruncles, do
grow so firmly to them, that when I endeavored to divide them, the gibbous
part would be sooner broken off from the interior coat of the Womb, then
recede from the Conception: contrary to their custom in Hinds and Does, whose
membrane called Chorion, is easily separated from the Cotylidones of the
caruncles; and the convexe side of the caruncles, which adhereth to the
Conception, may be divided from it; but the Concave part, or root rather, or
stalk, sticks fast to the Uterus. But in other matters, the office is alike
in all, and they have the like Acetabula, and an Albugineous gelly may in like
manner be milked out of them, as out of these caruncles of Cowes also.

Where there is but one single foetus in a Conception, there that foetus does
transmit his Umbilical Vessels to all the caruncles of both the Horns of the
womb, that so he may derive nutriment from both. But that Horn wherein the
foetus himself (swimming in the crystal water which lies within the coat called
Amnion) does reside, is larger then the other. But where there are two foetus
in one and the same Conception, there each of them are confined to their proper
caruncles, and do transmit their Umbilical Vessels into their own proper Horn
only, and receive their Nutriment from thence.

If it be a Male foetus, the Testicles are large (for it is time) hanging
without in the Scrotum. If an Ewe-lamb, the Udder hanging in the same place,
has little Tets or Nipples, as Women's Breasts.

In the twofold stomach of the foetus (namely, the Maw and the Dew-lap) there
appeared a crystal water like to that where he swam; for they did agree both in
color, sent, taste, and consistence: there was also in the upper Guts a
substance like to chyle; in the lower, a green excrement, and dry dung, such as
they use to eject when they graze: the Liver was something large, and the
Bladder of Gall of an oblong figure, and in some of them it was quite empty.

But as to the order of the production of the Parts, we have still found the
same to be observed in all Viviparous Embryo's whatsoever, as Experience has
revealed to us in that of the Egg, the Hind, and the Do.

Of the Innate Heat.
EXER. LXXI.
BEcause there is much talk of the Calidum Innatum, or Innate Heat, we do
intend in this place (by way of second course, or addition) to discourse a
while concerning both it, and the Humidum Primigenium, the Radical or
Primigenial moisture; and that the rather, because I perceive many men to
please themselves much with those two Notions, when as (according to my
judgment) they do not understand their meaning. The truth is, there is no need
at all to enquire after any kind of spirit distinct from the Blood it self, or
to introduce any foreign heat, or invoke the Deities to appear in the fable,
and so trim up Philosophy with vain opinions and fictions; for what we
commonly derive from the Stars, is bred and born at home, and within us. For
the Blood alone is the true Galidum Innatum, or firstborn Animal heat: as it
is made apparent by our observations concerning the Generation of Animals;
(especially of the Chicken out of the Egg) and therefore to multiply Entities,
is merely frivolous. For, indeed, there is nothing either before, or more
excellent in the Animal body, then Blood; nor are those spirits which some men
distinguish from Blood, any where to be found a part from the blood; and the
Blood it self, without spirit and heat, is no longer to be called Blood, but
Gore. The Blood, De part. an. l. 2 c. 3.
says Aristotle, is in a manner hot, and in such a manner, as it has the
essence of Blood in being hot just as if we should express Hot water under one
word: but yet being considered as the subject of Heat, and such a substance, as
when it is in being, is Blood, so it is not hot: for it is in some respect hot
per se, or essentially, and in some respect it is not hot per se; for Heat is
of its essence, as Whiteness is of the essence of a white man: but for as much
as it is blood, in relation to Action or Passion, so it is not calidus per se,
or essentially hot.

We Physicians call that Spiritus, a Spirit, which Hippocrates called Impetum
faciens, that is, whatsoever does attempt any thing proprio conamine, by its
own proper endeavor, and does set upon any action, or excite any motion with
agility and vehemence: and under that capacity, the spirits of Wine, or of
Vitriol, are called spirits. And hereupon Physicians count as many spirits, as
principal parts, or operations; namely, Animal, Vital, Natural, Visory,
Auditory, Concoctive, Generative, Implanted, Influent Spirits, etc. But the
Blood (the primogenit and principal part of the Body) is furnished with all
these respective qualities, and endowed with active power beyond all other
parts of the body, and does therefore deserve the name of a spirit (...).

Scaliger, Fernelius, and others, having not thoroughly considered the excellent
endowments implanted in the Blood, have phansied other Aerial or Aetherial
spirits, composed of an Aetherial and Elementary substance, to be a more
excellent and diviner Innate heat then blood; which they conceited to be the
most immediate instrument of the Soul, most proportionable to all its
operations: grounding their opinion upon this opinion; namely, that the Blood
(as being a substance compounded out of the Elements only) cannot perform any
action beyond the sphere or activity of the Elements, and such bodies as are
framed out of them. Hereupon they feigned a distinct spirit, and innate heat,
which is of a celestial extract; namely, a most simple, most subtle, most thin,
swift, lucid, and aetherial substance, partaking of a fifth essence. But yet
they have no where demonstrated that there is any such substance, or that it
does act beyond the power of the Elements, or execute greater things then the
Blood alone is able to accomplish. But we, who examine the nature of things
according to sense, have never discovered any such substance. Nor are there in
the Body any receptacles designed to the conservation, or generation of such
matters, and they themselves also have not assigned any. Feruelius, indeed,
says, That whosoever has not yet attained to the knowledge of the substance
and condition of the Innate Heat, must first consider the structure of our
bodies, and then address himself to the arteries which are seated in the cavity
of the Heart, and to the Ventricles of the Brain; which when he shall discover
void and empty, and without any humor contained therein, yet can be not
imagine that such worthy matters are made by Nature rashly, and to no use: and
upon this consideration, I conceive, he will presently conclude, that while the
Animal was alive, they were replenished by some thin Aerial substance, which
when the animal Soul departed, being exceeding light, did insensibly vanish.
Now, to support this substance, the faculty of Inspiration is bestowed upon us,
which does not only cool the body (for that might be derived to us by other
means) but also administer a kind of nourishment. But we affirm, that (so
long as the Animal is alive) the Arteries and Ventricles of the Heart, are
filled with blood; reputing the Ventricles of the Brain, to be too mean
instruments for so noble a work, conceiving them rather allotted to the
reception of excrements. For, what shall we say of those several Animals, whose
Brain has no Ventricles at all? And though we should admit, that a kind of
Air or vapor may be there found (because Nature does decline a vacuity) yet
that that substance is of a celestial extract, and heir apparent to such
excellent performances, has no semblance of truth at all. But that which we
most admire, is, How this so exquisite, so divine a Spirit, should be sustained
and fed by our common elementary air? especially, since themselves assure us,
that none of the Elements can perform any thing beyond their own abilities.

These men do likewise confess, that the spirit is in continual declension, and
quickly dissipated, and corrupted, and that it could not subsist one moment of
time, were it not repaired by the plentiful accession of outward aliment; and
that therefore like the Primum Vivens, the first particle inspired with life,
it must continually be fed. And now what need of this foreign guest, this
Innomate Spirit, or etherial heat? Since the blood is of ability to execute
whatsoever is attributed thereunto; and since these spirits cannot recede from
the blood, (without their dissolution) Nay they do not move any whither, or
insinuate themselves into any part (as distinct bodies) without the company of
the blood. For whether you conceive them to be framed, nourished, and increased
out of the thinner part of the blood, (as some imagine) or out of the
primigenial moisture (as others) yet all confess that they are no where to be
found out of the blood, but that they continually cleave to the blood, as to
their support (as the flame cleaves to the oil in the lamp.) And therefore
their tenuity, subtlety, and mobility, etc. are of no more use then the blood,
whose inseparable companions they are. So that the blood is sufficient, to
become the proportionate and immediate instrument of the Soul; because it is
every where present, and does fly to and fro with an admirable agility. Nor are
there any other bodies, or spirital incorporeal qualities, or any diviner heat
to be allowed of, (as lux and lumen, the Light, and Shine) as Caesar Dictato. 7.
Cremoninus (a man excellently versed in Aristotle's Philosophy) does solidly
contend against Albertus.

If these men pretend, that these spirits do reside in the primigenial
moisture, as in the last Aliment, and from thence insinuate themselfs into the
whole body, thereby to nourish all the parts; they then conclude upon an
impossibility, namely that the Calidum Innatum the Innate Heat, which is the
primigenial part of the body (and stands it self in need of sustenance) does
nourish the whole body. For upon this account, the same thing is both the thing
that is nourished, and also the thing by which it is nourished; and the self
same substance, under the same respect, should both feed it self, and be fed
also, which is indeed impossible: for in probability the thing which does feed,
and the thing which is fed, are not so much as mixed together: for miscible
things must be of equal power, and operate one upon the other. And Aristotle's
position is, Ubi nutritio, ibi nulla mistio est, Where there is Nutrition,
there is no Mistion. For wheresoever Nutrition is, there the Aliment is one
thing, and the thing nourished another; and a necessity of the transmutation of
the one into the other.

But whereas they conceive that the Spirits, and the last or primigenial
Aliment, or some other thing what ever it be in an Animal, can (more then the
blood) operate above the power of the Elements; they seem not to understand
what it is to operate above the power of the Elements: nor do they rightly
interpret that place of Aristotle, where he De genesis an. l. 2. c. 3.
says: Every virtue or faculty of the Soul, seems to partake of another
substance, and that more divine then those substances which are called
Elements. And likewise where he says, There is a certain thing in the seed of
all things, causing them to be fruitful, which thing is called heat, which is
not fire, nor no such faculty, but a spirit which is contained in the seed and
frothy body, and the nature which is in that spirit is answerable in proportion
to the Element of the Stars For fire does not generate any Animal, nor does any
thing seem to be constituted by thick, moist, or dry qualities. But the heat of
the Sun, and of Animals, not that only which is contained in the seed, but
also whatsoever excrement there be, though of a different nature yet even that
also has a vital principle. Wherefor it appears by what has been said, that
the hea^ contained in Animals, neither is it self fire, nor does take its
original from fire. For I also do affirm the same of the Innate Heat, and of
Blood, namely that they are not Fire, neither do they take their original from
fire, but do partake of a different, and more divine substance then fire is,
and therefore do not act by any elementary faculty; but as in the seed there is
something which does make it fruitful, and exceeds the virtues or powers of the
Elements in constituting an Animal body; namely the spirit and the nature which
is in that spirit, answerable in proportion to the element or substance of the
Stars.

So likewise in the Blood, there is a spirit or virtue, which does act above
the power of Elements (most conspicuous in the nutrition or preservation of
each particular part) and also a nature, nay a soul in that spirit and blood
answerable in proportion to the Element of the Stars. And lastly, it is most
evident, and my observations do plainly show it, that there is a Heat in the
Blood of Animals (whilst life continues) which is neither fire, nor does
derive its original from fire.

But for the clearer illustration of these matters, give us leave to digress a
while from our purpose, and declare briefly, what a spirit is, and what it is
to act above the power of Elements, and likewise what is meant by these words,
namely, to partake of a different body, and that more divine, then those bodies
which are called Elements: as likewise what is that nature in that spirit which
is answerable in proportion to the element or substance of the Stars. What A
Spirit, and Vital principle is, we have partly spoken already, and shall now
handle something more largely. There are three several (simple) bodies, which
do chiefly seem to challenge the name, or function at least of a spirit;
namely, the Fire, the Air, and the Water; and every one of these does seem to
partake of a life, or other body, by reason of their perpetual motion and flux;
(I mean) the Flame, the Wind, and the Flood. The Flame is the Flux, or Stream
of Fire, the Wind of Air, and the Flood of Water. Flame like an Animal, does
move it self, nourish, and increase it self, and is an Emblem of humane life.
And therefore it is much used in divine Ceremonies: and was religiously kept
(as a sacred thing) in the Temples dedicated to Apollo, and Vesta, by Virgins;
and amongst the Persians, and diverse other Nations, it was from all Antiquity
honored with divine worship. As if God were more visible in Fire, and did
converse with us, (as heretofore with Moses) out of the Fire. The Air also
seems to merit the name of a spirit too, for a spirit is called spiritus a
spirando, from breathing; and Aristotle confesses in plain terms, that there
is a kind of life and death of Winds. And lastly, the Water of the Flood De
genesis an. l. 4. c. ult.
or River, is called Viva, living Water. Those three bodies therefore (in as
much as they enjoy a kind of life) do seem to operate above the power of
Elements, and so partake of a diviner body or substance, and hereupon were by
the Heathen ranked amongst the gods, who conceived that whatsoever did perform
any eminent effects, which did surpose the naked abilities of the Elements,
those effects did proceed from some diviner Agent. As if it were the same
thing, to act above the power of the Elements, and to partake of a more divine
essence, which did not deduce it self from the Elements.

Thus in like manner the Blood does act above the Power of the Elements, when
now being the Primogenite part, and Innate Heat (as it is in the Seed, and in
the Spirit) it does constitute the other parts in order; and this with an
eminent providence and understanding, acting in order to a certain end, as if
it did exercise a kind of Ratiocination or discourse. For it does not these
offices as as it is Elementary, and deriveth its original from Fire, but in as
much as it is made the Primigenial Heat, and most immediate and convenient
instrument of life it self, by being empowered by the Plastical virtue, and
function of the Vegetative soul (...), the Blood is the Vegetal part of Man,
says Suidas, which is true also of all other Animals. And Virgil seems to
have intended as much, where he says:

-- Una eademque via sanguisque Animusque sequuntur:
Both Soul and Blood Aenead. 10.

Stream in one Flood.
The Blood therefore is a Spirit, in regard of its excellent power and virtue;
and also celestial, because the Soul is an Inne-mate in that spirit, which Soul
is of a nature answerable in proportion to the Element of the Stars; that is,
something which bears an Analogy to the Heavens, as being the Instrument and
Deputy of the Heavens.

And so in this manner, all natural bodies fall under a double consideration;
namely, as they are considered, in their private capacity, concluded within the
bounds of their own proper nature; or else, as they are the Instruments of a
nobler Agent, and superior power. For being considered in their own proper
abilities, it is perhaps no question, but that being all subject to generation
and corruption; they do derive their original from the Elements, and act
according to their rule: but being considered as they are the Instruments of a
more worthy Agent, and regulated thereby, they do not now act of themselves,
but by the guidance of another; and thereupon seem to participate of another
more divine Essence, and so exceed the power of the Elements.

So likewise the heat of the blood is an animal heat, inasmuch as it is guided
in its operations by the soul; and also a Celestial heat, as being subservient
to the Heavens; and lastly, a Divine heat, in that it is the Instrument of
Almighty God: as we have formerly said, where we also did demonstrate, that the
Male and Female, are the Instruments of the Sun, the Heavens, and of God
himself, as being subservient to the generation of Animals.

The Inferior World, according to Aristotle, is so continuous to the Superior
Orbs, that all its motions and mutations do seem to borrow their original, and
regulation from them. And truly in this World (which the Greeks call (...),
from the beauty of its order) the inferior and corruptible things are
subservient to the superior and incorruptible: and yet they all are obedient to
the will of the Almighty and Eternal Creator.

They therefore who conceive that in a body compounded of the Elements, it
cannot act beyond the power of the Elements; except it do also participate of
another more divine body; and upon that ground, do suppose those Spirits
whereof they treat, to be constituted partly out of the Elements, and partly
out of a certain Aetherial and Celestial substance, do seem to have built their
reasons upon a very shallow foundation. For you can hardly find out any
Elementary body, which does not in its actions surpass its own proper power.
Not to seek far for an instance, which is every where obvious; the Air and
the Water, while they carry ships to the farthest Indies, and round the world;
(and many times also into contrary parts) while they Grind, Bake, Sift, drain
deep Wells, cut Timber in sunder, kindle fires, bear up some things, and
overwhelm others, and perform many other innumerable and wonderful offices, do
they not seem to act above the power of Elements? So also Fire; how many, and
how strange employments does it undergo? viz. in the Kitchen, and also in the
Shops of such as deal in Mettles, and in the Chemists furnace, by sub^^^ation,
fusion, concoction, corruption, coagulation, and infinite other uses. What
shall we say of it, when Iron it self is produced by its assistance,

-- quod terram domat, and quaetit oppida bello?
Which tills the Field,
And makes Towns yield.
When the Lodestone (to which Thales did therefore ascribe a Soul) draws Iron
unto it, and that Mettle which subdueth all opposers, (as Pliny speaks) L.
36. c. 16.
pursues after I know not what vanity; and the Needle also being only touched
by this Loadstone, does still direct it self toward the Poles of the world.
When our Clocks do faithfully strike all the hours both of Day and Night, do
they not seem to partake of another Body, (besides the Elements) and that more
divine then the Elements? Since then such excellent Operations are produced by
the dominion and sway of Art; which operations do far exceed the power of the
Materials themselves; what shall we then think may be produced by the prescript
and regiment of Nature, whom Art does only imitate? And if they effect such
wonderful things in obedience to Men, what performances may we expect from
them, when they are instruments in the hands of God himself.

In short therefore, this distinction is necessary, namely, that no Primary or
first Agent, does act any thing beyond its own power: but every Instrumental
Agent, does exceed its own power; for it acts not only by its own power, but
also by the virtue of the superior efficient.

They therefore which deny such eminent endowments to the blood, and fly up to
Heaven to fetch down I know not what Spirits, to whom they may ascribe those
divine operations: they do not know, or at least do not consider, that the work
of Generation (and of Nutrition also, which is indeed a Species of Generation)
for whose sake they attribute such notable prerogatives to those Spirits, does
much exceed the power of those spirits themselves: and not of those spirits
only, but even of the Vegetal Soul, nay of the Sensitive, and in a word, of the
Rational soul her self, and not the power only, but the very apprehension of
the Rational soul; for the Nature and Order of Generation, is truly admirable
and divine, beyond the comprehension and grasp of our thoughts, or
understanding.

That it may therefore more clearly appear, that those eminent attributes which
learned men bestow upon the Spirits, and the Innate Heat, do belong to the
blood alone; These few following considerations do offer themselves, over and
above those things, which are wonderfully evident in an Egg (before any
rudiment of the Chicken appear) and also in a perfect and adult Foetus. Namely,
that the blood being considered absolutely in it self out of the Veins, as it
is an elementary substance, and composed of several parts (namly, of serous,
thin, crass, and concrete parts) is called Cruor, Gore, and does possess a few
only, and those obscure abilities. But being in the veins, as it is a part of
the body, and that also an Animate, and Genital part, and the Immediate
Instrument, and primary seat of the soul: and also as it seems to partake of
another more divine body, and is inspired with a divine animal heat; it is then
endowed with excellent abilities, and answerable in proportion to the element
of the Stars. In as much as it is a Spirit, so it is the Fire, the Vesta, the
Household deity, the Calidum Innatum, the Sun of the Microcosme, and Platoes
Fire; not because (like ordinary fire) it shines, burns, and destroys: but
because it does conserve, nourish, and increase it self, by a free perpetual
motion. It does also challenge the name of Spirit, in as much as it does
primarily, and before the other parts, abound with Radical moisture, which is
the last and nearest aliment thereof, and does dispense and provide the same
sustenance for all the rest of the parts; wherewith it self is supported:
namely while it does nimbly dart it self through the whole body, and nourish,
cherish, and keep alive all the parts thereof, (which it self does first frame,
and adjoin to it self) after the same manner as the superior Orbs (but
especially the Sun and Moon) do, by their continual motions, quicken and
preserve the inferior world.

Seeing therefore that the Blood does act above the power of the Elements, and
is inspired with such notable virtues, being also the Instrument of the
Omnipotent Agent; no man can worthily magnify and extol its wonderful and
divine faculties. In it the soul does first, and principally reside, and that
not the Vegetative soul only, but the Sensitive and Motive also; it penetrates
every part, and is every where present; and that being taken away, the soul is
presently gone: so that the blood seems to differ nothing from the soul; or
ought at least to be counted that substance, whose act the soul is. For such is
the soul, that it is not altogether a body, nor yet wholly without a body; it
comes partly from without, and is partly born at home: in some sort it is a
part of the body, and in some the beginning and cause of all things which are
contained in the Animal body; namely, nutrition, sense, and motion; and so
consequently of Life, and Death also: for whatsoever is nourished, does also
live; and so on the contrary. Likewise whatsoever is plentifully nourished, is
also enlarged; but that which is too sparingly nourished, does diminish: that
also which is perfectly nourished, does continue in health, but that which is
not, does incline to diseases. The blood therefore, as well as the soul, is to
be reputed the cause and author, both of Youth, and Old Age, of Sleep and
Waking, and of Breathing also: especially since in Natural productions the
first Instrument does contein in it self the internal moving cause. And
therefore it comes all to the same reckoning, whether we say, that the soul and
the blood, or the blood with the soul, or the soul with the blood, does
perform all the effects in an Animal.

We use, as persons that neglect the things themselves, to pay much reverence
to the specious names. The blood which is still at hand, and daily in our view,
makes no great noise in our ears; but at the magnificent name of Spirits, and
of an Innate Heat, we are strangely amused. But when once the vizour is plucked
from before them, as our error, so our wonder cease. That miraculous Stone,
rendered so venerable to Mizaldus by the commendation of Pipinus, did not only
fill him with admiration, but Thuanus also: (who was an eminent Historiographer
in his time) I shall here adjoin the Riddle it self. I saw, says he, a Stone
which was lately brought hither to our King out of the East Indies, which Stone
did dart forth light, and brightness, after a wonderful manner, sparkling and
shining with so much incredible luster, as if it were all burning, and in a
flame. This stone does by his rays scattered into every corner, illustrate the
ambient air with so clear a shine, that the firmest sight is scarce able to
behold it. It is also most impatient of earth: for if you attempt to cover it,
it does of its own accord, with an impetuous violence fly upward. All the Art
of man cannot confine and shut it up into a narrow room, for it seems to be
affected with free and open places only. The infinite purity, and brightness
thereof, is not tainted by the least spot, or blemish. It has no certain shape
or figure, but varieth, and is altered in an instant. And though it be most
fair and beautiful to the Eye: yet will it not endure to be touched: and if
you attempt too long to handle it, and continue too obstinate in your
resolution, it will mischief you: as many in my presence have deerly found.
And if any thing be by violence taken from it, it remains for all that (which
is very wonderful) nothing less then it was before. The stranger who brought
it, adds farther to all this, that its virtue and power is exceeding useful to
sundry emploiments, but will not discover them without a great reward.

This travailer also might have added to his description, that this Stone is
neither soft nor hard; that it puts on several shapes and complexions, that it
has a continual trembling and palpitation, and does like an Animal (though it
be an Inanimate thing) daily devour great store of food, converting it to its
own nutriment and augmentation: and that he has been told by men of good
credit, that this Stone did long ago fall down from heaven, and is to this day
the cause of Thunders and Lightnings; being some times begotten by the
refraction of the Sunbeams through the Waters.

Who can but admire so strange a Stone, and conceive less of it, then to be
above the power of the Elements, and so to partake of another body, and of an
etherial spirit, especially when he finds that it is answerable in proportion
to the Element or substance of the sun himself. And yet if Fernelius De abd.
rer. cause. l. 2. c. 17
may be the Oedipus, all this is but a Riddle of the Flame.

In like manner, if I should describe the Blood under the veil and covering of
a Fable, calling it the Philosophers stone, and displaying all its endowments,
operations, and faculties, in an aenigmatical manner; doubtless every body
would set a greater price upon it, and believing it to act beyond the Activity
of the elements, would ascribe another and more divine body unto it.

Of the Primigenial Moisture.
EXER: LXXII.
WE have now adorned the Blood with the Title of Calidum Innatum; and do
likewise conceive it proper, to dignifie the Colliquamentum Crystallinum, as we
call it (out of which the foetus, and its first parts do immediately arise) by
the name of Humidum radicale and Primigenium, the Radical and Primigenial
moisture. For we meet with nothing in the Generation of Animals, to which this
title does upon better right belong.

We have styled it the Radical moisture, because out of it the first particle
of the foetus, namely the Blood, and all the post-genit parts do arise, as out
of their Root; and do own the same, as the matter out of which they are
procreated, sed, increased and conserved.

We likewise call it Primigenial, because it is first generated in the
constitution of every Animal, and is as it were the foundation of all the other
parts: as is evident in an Egg, in which after a short time of Incubation, it
does approve it self to be the first production of the implanted fructifying,
and generative faculty.

It is likewise the most simple, pure, and sincere body imaginable: wherein all
the parts of the Chicken do abide in potentia, but none, actu: nature seeming
to have afforded to it the same privilege which men commonly ascribe to the
materiaprima, or first Matter, for which all things spring; namely, to be
capable of all forms, potentially, but to possess none, actually. So the
Crystalline humor of the Eye, to the intent that it may be susceptible of all
Colors, is it self void of all: and in like manner the Mediums, or organs of
each particular sense, are quite destitute of the qualities of sensible things,
or objects: namely the Organs of Hearing and Smelling, and the Air which is
subservient unto them, are without all Sound or Odor: so likewise, the
moisture of the tongue and mouth, is of it self insipid. And upon this Argument
chiefly do they rely, who constitute Intellectum possibilem incorporeum, a
Potential Understanding which is incorporeal, namely, because it is susceptible
of all forms without matter; and as the Hand is called Organum Organorum, the
instrument of instruments, so they affirm that to be forman formarum, the Form
of forms, having no matter at all, but being altogether Incorporeal, and
therefore they assert it to be Possibilis, Potential, but not Passibilis,
passible. And this moisture also does seem, if not the same, yet proportionable
to the last Aliment, whereof Aristotle does teach that the Animal Geniture or
Seed is made. I say the last Aliment, which the Arabians call Ros, the Dew,
wherewith all the parts of the Body are moistened and bedewed. For as that dew
does by farther condensation and adhesion pass into the alible gluten, or
glewey substance, and Cambium, which is that substance which does constitute
the parts of the body: so on the contrary, in the first generation and
nutrition, out of the glutinous substance dissolved and rarefied, is made a
Dew: namely, out of the White of an Egg is the Colliquamentum framed; which is
the radical moisture, and Ros primigenius, the primigenial Dew. Nay if there be
any faith due to our observations, the matter is the self same in both; and
that is a truth which all Philosophers consent in, and Physicians do not
dissent, namely, that an Animal is nourished by the same thing whereof it is
made; and augmented by that out of which it is generated. So that Ros
nutritious, the nutritive Dew, does differ from the Colliquamentum, or
primigenial moisture, only under the several respect of that which is first,
and that which is after: in that this is concocted and made by the Parents, and
that by the Foetus it self: and both the juices are the next and immediate
aliment of the Animal: yet not the first aliment; according to that saying,
Contraria ex contrariis augeri necesse est, Contraries are are necessarily
increased out of contraries; but the last (as I have said, and as Aristotle
also does denote) according to that other saying, Similiae ex similibus, Like
are fed by like. And both these humors do stand in that proxima potentia,
that next or most immediate capacity or potentiality, by which (all impediments
being removed) they are ready of their own accord, or by the law of nature, to
pass or be transformed into all the parts of the Body.

Which things being so, all the controversies which do arise concerning the
matter, and aliment of Animals, seem to be easily reconciled. For whereas some
were of opinion, that the seed, or matter ejected in coition was deduced from
all the parts of the body, and that therefore the child had the resemblance of
the Parents imprinted in it, Aristotle says thus: We must be of a different
judgment from the Ancients: for whereas they do De genesis an. l. 1. c. 18.
own that to be the seed which is discharged from the whole body; we conclude
that to be the seed, which of its own inclination does conduce to the
constitution of the whole body: and whereas they call it a Colliquamentum, or
melted substance, we rather style it excrementum, an excrement; (but he had a
little before said, I call an excrement the relics of the aliment, and a
Colliquamentum, that which is separated from the excrement by a praeternatural
resolution:) for that which comes last to the parts, and is the excrement of
that last aliment, is in probability a like substance. As Painters have
commonly some remnant of those colors, which they have spent upon their
Pictures: but now that which does melt away and dissolve, does corrupt and
degenerate. One Argument to prove that the excrement is rather the seed, then
any colliquated matter, is this; namely, that those Animals which are of great
growth, are less fruitful; but little Animals are most of all fertile. For
there must of necessity be more dissolved matter in great Animals, but less
excrement: for the stock of aliment is wasted in the support of a large bulk;
and thereupon there is little excrement. Moreover, there is no place designed
by nature for the reception of that substance or matter which does melt off
from the body: but there is a place assigned to all the natural excrements: as
for example, the Guts are intended for the excrements of the dry aliment; the
bladder of urine for the moist; the stomach for the profitable or useful
excrements; and the Womb, the Genital parts, and the Breasts, for the Seminal:
for unto those places they resort, and assemble themselves. Likewise by several
other arguments he proceeds to maintain, that the seminal substance, out of
which the Foetus is framed, is the same with that which is provided for the
nourishment of the parts. As if a man should desire a little coloring from a
Painter; surely the Painter would not scrape off that coloring which he has
already laid upon his Picture, but afford him some of that which remains, and
this supernumerary staff is of the same nature with that which he has
expended upon his Picture. So likewise the Excrement of the last Aliment, or
the Relics of that nutritious substance which is called Ros, and Gluten, is
deposited in the Genetal parts: and this opinion is most agreeable to the
Generation of the Eggs in the Hen.

Physicians also (who conclude that all the parts at the beginning are made out
of seed, or sperme, (and upon that ground call them spermatical parts) do
affirm that the seed is by the power of the Genital parts made out of the last
aliment (which they with Aristotle conceive to be blood) and so does constitute
the matter of the Foetus. It is indeed a plain case, that the egg is produced
by the Hen, and from her last aliment (namely her Ros nutritious, her nutritive
juice.) The White therefore of an Egg, or that primogenit, or rather antegenit
colliquamentum, or melted substance, is to be reputed the truer seed of the Hen
(though it be not ejected in coition, but provided ready before coition, or
else collected after it; (as shall be perhaps more largely declared, to be
incident to several Animals) which the geniture of the Male, does according to
Aristotle, coagulate.

Since therefore I plainly see, that all the parts are fashioned and fed by
this one moisture only, (as the matter and first root of all) and since the
forecited argument does necessarily conclude as much; I can scarce refrain my
pen from rebuking those that follow Empedocles and Hippocrates also: (who will
needs have all similar bodies to be generated by the congregation of the four
contrary Elements: (as being mixed bodies) and dissolved or corrupted by their
segregation) nor is Democritus and the Epicureans, who follow him, less
blameable, who constitute all things out of the confluence of Atoms of
different Figures. For it was their error of old, and is a popular error at
this day, that all similar bodies are framed out of heterogeneous or different
bodies. For according to this opinion, had a man Lincous his eyes he could not
discern any thing that were similar, one in number, identity, and continuity:
but there were nothing but an appearing union, and an assembly or heap made up
of a congregation and certain colligation of indivisible bodies: so that
generation were nothing else but an aggregation, and convenient positure of
several parts.

But for my part, neither in the production of Animals, nor in the generation
of any similar body whatsoever, (whether it were of the parts of Animals,
Plants, Stones, or Minerals, etc.) I could never discover any such
congregation, or any several praeexistent miscible bodies, which were to be
united afterward in the work of Generation. Nor (so far as I could ever yet
perceive, or by any means observe) are there any similar parts which are first
constituted in their several order, or existence at the same time together (as
membranes, flesh, fibers, gristles, bones, etc.) that so from them conioined
together (as out of the Elements or first rudiments of Animals) the organs or
parts, and the whole entire animal should at last be framed; but as we said
before, the first rudiment of the body is only a similar soft gluten, or
stiff, substance, not unlike a spermatical concernment, or coagulated seed: out
of which (the decree of Generation going on) being changed, cut in sunder, or
distributed into several parcels, as by the divine Mandat as we have said, (let
here be a Bone, there a Nerve, or a Muscle, here the Bowels, the receptacles of
the Excrements, etc.) out of an inorganical substance, was made an organical:
out of one, and that one being of the same nature, were many things made, and
those also diverse, and contrary: not by a kind of transposition, or local
motion (as if by the virtue of the heat, there did arise a congregation of
homogeneous, and a disgregation of hetorogeneous bodies) but rather by a
disgregation of homogeneous parts, or bodies, then any composition of
heterogeneous.

And this do I believe to be observed in every Generation; so that the Similary
mixed bodies have not their Elements existent in time before them, but are
rather themselves in being before their Elements, (whether you understand by
Elements the Fire, the Air, the Earth, and the Water, with Empedocles, and
Aristotle; or the Salt, the Sulphur, and the Mercury, with the Chemists; or the
Atoms with Democritus) as being in Nature more perfect then they. There are I
say mixed and compounded bodies, even in respect of time before any Elements, as
they call them, into which they are corrupted and determine; for they are
dissolved into those elements rather in order to our apprehension, then really
and actually. And therefore those bodies called Elements, are not before those
things which are made and generated; but rather after them, and their Relics
rather then their Principles. Nor does Aristotle himself, nor any other
Philosopher, demonstrate that the elements do subsist apart, or are the
Principles of similar bodies.

Indeed Aristotle, where he goes about to prove, L. 3. de coelo. c. 31.
that there are such things as Elements, seems to waver in his judgment,
whether he should resolve that they were actually in being, or only in
potentia: and does conceive that in natural things they are in potentia rather
then actu: and therefore he affirms that there are such things as Elements, out
of the division, segregation, and solution of things. And yet that is but an
infirm argument, namely, that natural bodies are generated or compounded first
out of those things, into which they are at last dissolved and corrupted: for
by that argument, somethings should be compounded of Glass, of Ashes, and of
Smoke; (because we see them reduced at last into such bodies) and since
Artificial Distillation does clearly demonstrate, that so many several Vapors
or Waters, and those all of them of different Species, are extracted out of so
many several bodies; the number of the elements ought to multiply in infinitum.
Nor does any Philosopher say, that the Bodies which are dissolved by Art, and
are called Sincere Bodies, and indivisible in species, are more single
elements, then the Air, Water, and Earth, which we perceive by Sense, and are
obvious to our eyes.

And lastly, we do not see that any thing is naturally produced out of fire, as
a miscible substance; and perhaps it is altogether impossible there should;
since fire (like a kind of living body) is in contiual flux, and seeks
sustenance whereby it may be nourished, and conserved: according to that of
Aristotle, that fire only is nourished, and that chiefly because of its form.
But whatsoever De genesis and corr. l. 2. c. 50.
is nourished, cannot possibly be it self mixed with its nutriment. Whereupon
it follows, that it is impossible for Fire to be miscible. For Mistion,
according to Aristotle, is miscibilium alteratorum unio, the union of miscible
things altered; where one miscible thing is not transformed into another, but
both of them being both active and passive in regard of themselves, do
constitute a third thing: but generation (especially that which is by a
Metamorphosis) is the distribution of one similar thing which is to be altered
into diverse more. Nor are mixed similar bodies said to be generated out of the
Elements, but in some sort to be constituted out of them: into which also they
are capable to be dissolved.

But these matters do properly relate to that part of Physiology, which
treats of the Elements, and the Temperaments: where also we shall discourse
more copiously of them.

Of the Birth.
AFter the Generation, the Birth succeeds, by which the Foetus coming into
the world, does enjoy the outward Air. Whereupon we conceive it convenient to
speak something concerning it. And therefore (with Fabricius) we shall consider
the Causes, Manner, and Times of Birth; as also those things which are
precedent and subsequent thereunto.

Those things which are incident a little before the Birth, and especially to
Women, presaging the approaching delivery, are in part the preparation and
disposition of the Childing Woman, whereby she may bring forth: and in part the
site, or proper position of the Infant in order to the Birth.

As concerning the Position, Fabricius says, that it is of a conglobated and
inflex figure, left the Foetus by his extreme and eminent parts, might injure
the De form. Foetus c. 9. page 140. The Position of the Foetus in the Womb.
Womb, or the containing membranes: and likewise that so he may be comprehended
in the lesser room. But I am not of opinion that the foetus does still observe
the same site or positure of his members in the Womb, (for the fore-scited
causes.) For he swimmeth in a water, and moves himself to and fro, he
stretches himself, now this way, and anon that, and so is variously inflected,
and tumbled up and down; in so much that sometimes being entangled in his own
Navel-string, he is strangely ensnared. True it is that all Animals, while they
lie still and sleep, do for the most part draw in, and contract themselves, and
direct themselves toward an Oval or Conglobated figure. So likewise Embryo's,
which pass their time most in slumbers, do compose their bodies in that posture
wherein they are formed: (as being the most natural, most easy, and most
advantageous for their sleep.) And therefore the Infant in the Womb is commonly
found, with his Knees drawn up to his Belly, his Thighs bent backwards, his
Feet hanging down, and his Hands elevated to his Head, whereof the one is
placed about his Temples or Ears, and the other at his Cheek; in which parts
there are white spots discovered in the skin, as being the signs of his
confrication: His Spine is bent round, and his Neck being inflected, his Head
hangs near his Knees. The Embryo is situated with that position of parts,
wherewith we commonly apply our selves to rest, with his Head uppermost, and
his Face directed toward his mothers Spine. But a little before his Birth, his
head being bent downwards, he dives toward the bottom, and the Orifice of the
Matrix, (as if he were seeking his way out.) So Aristotle: All Animals Hist.
an. 2. c. 8.
do naturally come into the world with their head foremost; but those that lie
cross, or come with their heels foremost, are unnatural births. But yet this is
not constant in all Animals, but according to their several site or position in
the Womb, so is their Birth various; as in Bitches, Sows, and other Multiparous
Animals. And the Great-bellied Women know full well, that even the humane
Embryo does sometimes acquire a different situation; when they find the Child
kick sometimes above, sometimes below, and now on this side, and at other times
on that.

So also the Matrix being near delivery, does The Matrix.
bear down, grows soft, and opens its Orifice. The Waters also as they
commonly call them, are Gathered, that is, a certain part of the Chorion, in
which the foresaid humor is contained, does usher in the Foetus, and slide
down from the Matrix into the Vagina, or Sheath of the Womb: and the
neighboring parts also are loosened, and ready to distend: also the
Articubation of the Holy bone, and the Share-bone to the Hanch-bone (which
Copulation, or Articulation is by Synchondrosis, or a gristly ligament) is so
softened and losened, that the foresaid bones do easily give way to the
parting Infant; and by gaping open, do amplify the whole region of the
Hypogastrium, or Lower belly. And when these things are in this condition, it
is certain that the Birth is at hand. And that so the Foetus (like a ripe
fruit) may come forth into the World, Nature makes this provision of dilating
the parts: as she likewise concocteth the Milk which is sent before into the
Breasts, that the Infant now ready to be born, may have his entertainment ready
to welcome him, being now to be sustained from without. And these are the
forerunners of the Birth. Wherefore the Milk is counted amongst the chiefest
signs of an imminent birth: I mean such Milk, which both for store, plenty,
and consistence, is convenient to feed the Child: which (according to
Aristotle) is never so qualified but near the time of the Birth, and therefore
is never found before the seventh month.

Fabricius concludes upon two queries, chiefly Genesis an. l. 4. c. 8. and l. 7.
c. 5. page 141.
in order to the Foetus: namely, how the birth is, and when? the last whereof
relates to the time of Bearing, the first to the manner of the Birth it self.

The times of bearing, are by Aristotle conceived De genesis an. l. 4. c. 4. and
ult.
to be various. There are, says he, peculiar times of bearing to all kind of
Animals, for the greatest part as long as they live: for the race of Animals
which is longer lived then others, must of necessity be more durable. But the
magnitude of the Animals is by him assigned as the chiefest cause of the
variety of the times of bearing. For, says he, the great fabric, either of
Animals, or any thing else, cannot be easily absolved in a short space:
Wherefore Mares, and those Animals that are of kin to them, though they live
but a shorter time, yet they are longer in bringing forth: And therefore the
Elephant (as they say) is two years in her production, because of its excessive
magnitude. But every Animal has certain bounds of magnitude, which it cannot
exceed: and therefore they have a definit matter, out of which they are made:
he adds moreover: But there is exceeding good reason, why Animals do receive
the dimension or measure of their times of ingravidation, generation, and their
lives also by certain Circulations. Now I call a Circulation, a day, a night, a
month, a year, and all those times which are described by them, as also the
motions of the Moon: for these are the common beginnings of Generation to all
Animals: For it stands to good reason that the Circulations of less principal
things should follow the Circulations of more principal. And therefore Nature
has defined or limited the generation and decease of Animals, by their motions.

And as the Births of Animals do depend upon the Revolutions or Circuits of the
Sun and Moon, so do their times of Coition, and bearing their young vary, and
are either more prolixe, or breifer.

The time of going with young (says Aristotle in the same place) is enormous
only in Women. For all other creatures have some one time, but a Woman has
several, for a Child may be borne either the Seventh, or the Tenth month, and
likewise in the months intervening between the Seventh and the Tenth: For they
that are borne in the Eighth month, though they do seldom live, yet they may
live. Diverse Animals have indeed a set time of bringing forth, and specially
in the Spring, when the Sun returns; diverse in the Summer, and some in the
Autumn, as the Gristley Fishes. And hence it happens, that when the time of
bringing forth approaches, they direct themselves to their wonted places,
where they may safely build their Stalls, or Nests, where they may bring forth,
cherish, and sustain their young.

Hence it is that those Winds which blow about the beginning of the spring, are
called, Or^ithiae, namely from the coming or flocking in of the Birds, which
about that time, do by the help of those Winds arrive at certain usual places.
And Fishes also which swim in Shoals many hundred thousands together, do
conspire to meet in such particular parts, and at such set times, to spawn and
cherish their fry.

And likewise in the Spring, so soon as ever the Cankerwormes do appear, (whose
seeds are for the most part carried about by the Winds like invisible Atoms;
and are not begotten as people commonly believe, either of their own accord, or
out of putrefaction) the trees do presently shoot forth their buds, which are
to become the sustenance of those creatures: and they themselves also are
pursued by small Birds, and conducted into their Nests to be devoured by their
young.

So that whenever we see unusual kinds of these Canker-wormes, we do likewise
meet with several sorts of foreign little birds, which are seldom seen at other
times, (as if these Birds did (...) Son sued for the Inheritance, did cast him
in Law though his Mother did affirm that the eldest Son was born in the
thirteenth month: because there seemet to be no certain time allotted for
bringing forth. There was a Woman not long since amongst us, which kept a Child
within her above sixteen months, and perceived him to bestir himself in her
Womb above ten months (as many did evidence) and ye^ at last she brought him
forth alive. But, I confess those are rare accidents. And therefore Spigelius
does reprechend Ulpian the Lawyer without cause in that he admits none to be
legitimate Heirs tha^ are borne after the tenth month. For Laws and rules of
Art, are for the most proportioned o^ fitted to the actions of life, which are
rightly ordered.

Besides, it must not be denied, that there are many crafty, fraudulent Women,
which for lu^^ Hist. an. l. 7. c. 4.
cre sake, or for fear of punishment or infamy, wi^^ feign and swear that they
are with Child. And likewise it is well known, that others are easily deceived,
and being inexperienced in the matter do conceive themselves to be with Child,
when it is no such thing. And to this purpose are those words of Aristotle. The
conception of those Infants which are borne after the eleventh month seems
to have not been exactly known to the Women who are with Child, for the women
do not know when they first conceived. For their Wombs being possessed with
flatulencies, and they afterward conceiving a Child upon Coition, conceive
that flatulency to have been the first beginning of their conception, because
they then had some usual indications, as do accompany such as do really
conceive. And we have also a^ other times known, that after three, or four
months space, the former conception dying in the Womb, and putrefying, and the
corrupt matter (like to putrid after-purgings) flowing forth, a Superfoetation
has happened: and yet the same Women have constantly affirmed that they have
been delivered of a Child after the fourteenth month. It falls out some
times, says Aristotle, that after one Abortment, ten or twelve succeeding
Ibid.
Infants which have been conceived by a superfoetation, have fallen from the
Mother. But if the Mothers have been delivered in some short time after, they
have brought forth that Child which was begotten by a superfoetation: and so
they bring them forth, like those children which are born Twins: As the Fable
runs of Iphicles and Hercules. And this has been already found to be so. For a
certain Adultress brought forth two Children, one like her own Husband, and the
other like the Adulterer. And likewise a certain Woman a long while since,
having Twins within her, did conceive a third Child also, so that when the
time of her delivery was fully come, she brought forth the Twins in their
just time, and they were perfect: but the third was but of five months time,
and so he died instantly.

A certain Servant-Maid being gotten with Child by her Master, to hide her
knavery came to London in September, where she Lay in by stealth: and being
recovered again, returned home: but in December following, a new birth (for she
had a Superfoetation) did proclaim the crime which she had cunningly concealed
before.

It happened to another Woman (as Aristotle proceeds) that when she had
brought forth one Child in the seventh month, she was after two months end,
delivered of two more, whereof the first Child died, but the Twins survived.
Likewise some Women that have suffered abortment, have conceived two Children
at the same time, whereof the one has been aborted before the time, and the
other has continued the full time, and been brought forth perfect.

For it is an easy matter, that the first, or last Conception which is
conceived by a Superfoetation; being ejected after the third or fourth month,
the following months may be reckoned more or less then they ought to be,
especially by credulous or unskilful Women.

I have sometimes known the Conception to perish in the Womb, and being turned
into Putrid Matter, to have glided and issued forth: (like the flores albi) and
this both in Women and other Animals. There was not long since a Woman in
London, which after such a kind of Abortment did conceive again; and was
delivered at the just time. But a little after, as she went about her work,
being not in any great pain, or distemper, she did eject by pieces the black
little Bones, which related to her former Abortment. Some of these Bones were
brought to me, which I could discover to be the fragments of the Spine, the
Bone of the Thigh, and of other Bones.

I know a young Woman, who was the Daughter of a Physician, who was of my near
acquaintance, which being Big, felt all the Symptoms incident to Women in that
condition; and continuing healthy and sprightly, after the fourteenth week she
perceived the motions of a Foetus in her Womb; and having finished her time for
going with Child, conceiving the hour of her delivery to be nigh at hand, she
had her Bed furnished, her Cradle ready, and all the implements appertaining to
the purpose laid out for use. But all these preparations came to nothing, and
Lucina was cross to her wishes; for her customary pains quite left her, and
her Belly as it rose by degrees, so it sunk again, and she never sick for
the matter, but she remained barren ever after.

I also knew a noble Matron, who had borne above ten Children, and whose
Courses were never suppressed unless she were with Child. But being afterward
married to another Husband, besides other usual signs, she apprehended her
self to be with Child, by the stirring of it (which both she her self, and her
Sister also, who then lay with her in bed, did many times in the night
perceive) and all the Arguments I could suggest, could not remove that
persuasion from her: till at the last, all her hopes vanished into flatulency
and fatness.

So that sometimes, the most approved signs of Ingravidation, have not only
deluded the silly Women, but the experienced Midwives, and the skilful
Physicians themselves. Wherefore, since besides the deceits of Women
themselves, there are several false Indications of Gravidation, we must not
rashly determine of the Inordinate Birth, before the Seventh Month, or after
the Eleventh.

The ordinary Computation of going with Child, observes that time which our
blessed Savior, the perfectest of all men, did fulfill in the Virgins Womb:
namely, from the day of the Annunciation, which is in March, to that blessed
day of the Nativity, which we celebrate in December. And according to this
Rule, the Sager Matrons keeping their account (while they cast in the wonted
day in every month, whereon they were accustomed to have their purgations)
they are seldom out of their Reckoning; but, ten Revolutions of the Moon beeng
expired, they are delivered, and reap the fruit of their Womb, upon that very
day whereon (were it not for their Praegnation) their Purgations would ensue.

As concerning the causes of the exclusion or delivery of the Foetus,
Fabricius, besides that given De usu part. l. 15. c. 7.
by Galen (wherein he delivers, That the Foetus is so long continued in the
Womb, till being now enlarged and made perfect, he is capable of being
sustained at the mouth: by which argument, the weaker sorts of Foetus ought to
protract their continuance in the Womb, which yet is no such matter:)
conceives the other reason, and that the more rational one too, to be the
necessity that the Foetus stands in of more large refrigeration procured by
respiration: because the Foetus, so soon as it is borne, does presently
respire, but does not so soon feed. And this (he affirms) is not only
observable in Men and Beasts, but chiefly in Birds: which though they be small,
and have yet but a tender bill, yet will the Chickens peck that part of the
shell, where they stand in most need of respiration: which thing they do,
being more straightened for Breath, then Aliment: Seeing that immediately as
soon they are escaped out of the shell they do respire, but abstain from meat
two or three days together.

But whether Respiration be instituted for Refrigeration, or for any other use:
we shall more largely debate elsewhere, out of our Observations.

In the mean time I shall propose this Problem to the Learned; namely, How the
Embryo does subsist after the seventh month in his Mothers womb? when yet in
case he were borne, he would instantly breath: nay he could not continue one
small hour without it? and yet remaining in the womb, though he pass the ninth
month, he lives, and is safe without the help of Respiration. I shall deliver
it yet more plainly. How comes it to pass, that the Foetus being now borne,
and continuing yet covered over with his entire membranes, and abiding still in
his water, can subsist for some hours space, without any danger of suffocation:
and yet being shifted out of those membranes, if he have but once attracted the
Air into his Lungs, he cannot afterward live a minute without it, but dies
instantly? doubtless this is not for want of Refrigeration: for in a difficult
Delivery, he sticks fast in the streights without any^ Respiration, sometimes
for some hours together; and yet we find him alive: but yet so soon as he has
escaped, and tasted the vital air, if you deprive him of it, you destroy him in
a moment. So likewise in the Cesarean Section the Infant is taken out of his
Mothers womb, many hours after his Mothers decease, and yet he is found
alive, and continues safe, without the use of Air, though he lie intombed in
the Secundines: but having once attracted the Air, (though you instantly
restore him to the Secundines again) he will expire for want of breath.
Whosoever does carefully consider these things, and look narrowly into the
nature of Air, will (I suppose) easily grant, that the Air is allowed to
Animals, neither for refrigeration, nor nutrition sake. For it is a tried
thing, that the Foetus is sooner suffocated after he has enjoyed the Air,
then when he was quite excluded from it: as if the Heat within him, were rather
inflamed, then quenched by the Air.

But thus much we have discovered by the way concerning Respiration; being
perhaps resolved to discuss the debate more fully in its proper place: then
which disquisition you shall hardly meet with a more nice; for it is debated
with Arguments of almost equal weight on both sides.

I return to the Birth, which Fabricius conceives to come to pass (besides the
forementioned necessity of Respiration, and want of Sustenance) because the
Foetus being grown bigger, does press out by his weight; and also can be no
longer contained within, by reason of his large bulk; and likewise, says he,
the Excrements are so multiplied, that there is no longer place for them in the
membranes. But we have already proved, that the humors in the Womb are not
Excrementitious. Nor is the reason deduced from the Weight and Magnitude of the
Foetus more available then the former: for the Foetus swimming aloof in the
humors, is scarce any burden at all to the Afterbirth or Womb; for some
Infants of nine months are very little, and less then some others of eight
months only, yet can they no longer subsist in the Womb. And as to the
Weight, Twins of eight months do preponderate any one single Foetus
whatsoever, though of nine months abode in the Womb, yet are they not born
till the nineth month. Nor can we quarrel at the scarcity of Aliment: since at
that time there is entertainment enough even for Twins, and sometimes for more
Infants: and also the milk which is conducted to the Breasts of Women in
Childbed, being recalled to the Uterus, would as conveniently supply the
foetus in the Womb, as out of it.

I shall rather impute the cause of being born, to the juice contained in the
Amnion, which being most proportionate to the nourishing of the Foetus, does
either much fail, or else is depraved by the admixture of the superfluities.
As I have also hinted before.

But as for the diversity of going with Child, which is contrary to the time
allotted by Nature (which diversity does chiefly respect Women) I do ascribe it
to the custom of living, the infirmity of the constitution, and the several
passions incident to Women. And therefore those tame Animals, which live
amongst us, by reason of their lazy lives, and plenty of food, are of more
incertainty in their times of Coition, and production, then wild Beasts, which
live according to Natures intent. Likewise sickly Women have easier and greater
dispatch in their Travail, then others: but it falls out clean contrary to
such Women, whose strength is very much consumed. For the same thing befalls
them, as happens to Plants, whose fruits and seeds, do more slowly and seldom
arrive to maturity in cold Countries, then to other Plants of the same kind
which are in a fat and warm soil.

So Orenges in England adhere to the trees almost two whole years together,
before they come to maturity: and Figgs also scarce ever arrive at any
perfection here, which are ripe in Italy twice or thrice a year. And the like
befalls the fruits of the Womb; namely, the Foetus is brought to maturity
sooner or later, by reason of the scarcity or plenty of Aliment, the
imbecility, or strength of the body, and the orderly or inordinate regiment of
life (according to the six non-naturall things recited by Physicians.)

Fabricius has described the Manner of the Birth, thus: The Womb being dilated
by the weight of the Foetus; in so much that it can now be no farther
distended, and thereupon being excited to disburden The manner of the Birth.
it self, is by the motion of the transverse fibers gathered up into it self,
and so contracted into a narrower compass. And therefore, whereas before,
neither the Excrements, by means of their abundance, nor the Foetus by reason
of his weight could be contained any longer, the Uterus being more straightened
and drawn together then it was, can be much less able to contein them, and
therefore first the membranes as being the weaker parts, and more distended, do
break, and the humor which is most fluxile, does first pass out to make the
parts glibbe. And hereupon the Foetus follows, as being not only increased
in his weight (by reason that he now no longer swimmeth in the humor) and so
descends downwards, forcing the Orifice of the Womb, but as being also
compressed, driven forward, and shut out by the action of the Womb itself: in
which act on, the muscles of the Abdomer, together with the Midriffe, are
wonderfully assistant.

By which words he describes the ejectment of the Excrements of the Guts, and
an Abortion rather, then a Natural Birth: for though the membranes in Women do
for the most part break, and so disload the Water before the Birth; yet that is
not always so: for other Animals do not bring forth as they do, but produce the
Entire Conception together, (namely the foetus together with the Secundines) as
we may observe in Ewes, Mares, Bitches, and other Animals: and especially in
the Viper, which does conceive within an Egg which is of one only color,
having a soft shell (such as the humane conception is) and continues that
Conception so long within her, until a foetus be formed thereout, which she
does produce wrapped up in a membrane, which membrane (according to Aristotle)
is broken up the third day. And yet it so happens, sometimes, that the young
Hist. an. l. 5. c. 34.
ones are produced, having eaten through the membranes, (while they are yet in
the Uterus.)

And so also it is no novelty to experienced Midwives, that their Women do
sometimes bring forth their Conceptions whole, and entire, without any breach
in the Membranes at all. And this kind of birth seems to me the most Natural;
wherein the foetus (like a mellow fruit which droppeth from the tree, without
shaking out its seed before the time assigned by nature) is born with the
Secundines embracing it. But, where it comes otherwise to pass, and the
After-burden does adhere to the Uterus after the Child is borne: it is
oftentimes hardly divided from it, and does induce evil Symptoms, which are
accompanied with noisome smells, and sometimes with a Gangreen, whereby the
Mother is brought into imminent danger.

Because therefore the Birth described by Fabricius, is not agreeable to all
kinds of Births, but only to Women, and not to all their Births neither, but
to such only whose Births are premature, and as it were forced: it is to be
ranked rather amongst preternatural, precipitate, and in some sort abortive
productions.

In a Natural and Genuine Birth, therefore, two Two things required in a
Natural Birth.
things are required, which are assistant the one to the other, that is to say,
the Woman in travail, and the Foetus which is to be produced. Both which,
except they be ripe for the business, the Birth is hardly successful. For if
the Foetus being disquiet, and coveting to be enlarged, do prevent his parent
by exciting her, and offering violence to her womb: or if the Mother, by reason
of the infirmity of her retention, (as if her womb were disturbed with a kind
of nauseousness) or by some necessity of expulsion, be before hand with the
Infant, the Birth is to be reputed a Disease or Symptom, rather then a Natural
and critical Production. As also when some parts of the conception escape out,
and others are still retaind within: namly, if the Foetus attempt a departure
ere the After-burden be dismissed from the sides of the Womb; or else the
After-burden, on the contrary, be loose from the Uterus, the foetus being not
rightly composed, nor the Uterus relaxed for the accommodation of the work. And
therefore the younger, more giddy, and officious Midwives are to be rebuked;
which, when they hear the woman in travail, cry out for pain, and call for
help; lest they should seem unskilful at their trade, and less busy then comes
to their share, by daubing over their hands with oils, and distending the
parts of the Uterus, do mightily bestirre themselves, and provoke the expulsive
faculty by medicinal potions: so that being impatient of a competent
expectation, by their desire to hasten and promote the Birth, they do rather
retard and pervert it, and make it an unnatural and difficult delivery; and
leaving the Membranes, or some part of the After-burden still adhering to the
Womb, they do both expose the poor women to the injuries of the Air; and
vainly persuading them to their three-legged stool, weary them out, and bring
them in danger of their lives. It is much happier with poor women, and those
that dare not own their great bellies, where the Midwives help is never
required; for the longer they retain and retard the Birth, the easier, and more
successful proves the delivery.

And therefore there are chiefly two sorts of Unnatural Births; namely when the
foetus is either born before, or after the time allotted by nature: (and this
is a kind of Abortive Birth) and the Birth proves difficult and painful,
because it does not succeed in that manner, and order as it ought to do: or
else is hindered by some bad Symptoms: which comes to pass chiefly for two
reasons: namely, in that the Mother does fail in her expulsive office, or else
that the Foetus is himself but sluggish, and so does not promote his own
release: for a facile and natural delivery relieth upon the endavour and joint
furtherance of both parties.

Fabricius does ascribe the work of bringing forth to the Uterus, to which
performance, says he, the Muscles of the Lower Belly, and the Midrifle are
assistants. But when I consider the matter thoroughly, the throws of the woman
in travail do seem to proceed from the Motion and Agitation of all the Body,
(just as we find it in Sternutation.) I knew a young Woman, which by reason of
her extreme torment in her travail fell into a Sown; and became instantly so
consternated, stupid, and sleepy, that nothing could recover her. I being
called in to her cure (finding that Clysters, and other proper remedies had
been applied to no purpose, and that nothing could go down her throat) I put up
a feather which was dipped in a strong Sneezing medicine, into her Nose; by
which being moved (though she was so overwhelmed with a deep stupidity, that
she could neither sneeze, nor be awaked) she began to be seized by a kind of
general Convulsion, all her body over, which beginning at the shoulders, did by
degrees extend it self to the lower parts. But as often as I applied this
provocation to her, her delivery was advanced and came on, and at last, the
Mother being insensible of it her self, and remaining still in her sleepy
condition, a healthy and sprightly Child was born into the world.

We may observe the manner of their throws, in other Animals: (as in the Ewe,
the Bitch, and in great Cattle) wherein we shall discover that it is not by the
sole action of the Uterus, or Belly either, but is the joint conflict of all
the whole body. And how much the Foetus does confer to the acceleration and
facilitating of his own Birth, is chiefly evident in Oviparous Creatures: for
it is apparent that the Foetus it self, and not the Mother, does break through
the shell. By which it is probable that in Viviparous births also, the chiefest
cause of being born is owed to the Foetus it self, and that, to his industry
and endeavor, and not to his weight, as Fabricius conceives. For what does
the weight thereof conduce to the birth in four-footed beasts which stand
upright, or sit down; or in Women which lie along? nor does the endeavor of
the foetus proceed, as he supposes, from its largeness of bulk, or the plenty
of the water, (the Water indeed is the cause of the delivery of the foetus
which is dead and putrified in the womb, in that by its corruption and acrimony
it does extimulate the Uterus to relieve it self) but the foetus himself sets
open the Gates of the Womb with his head turned downward, and unlocks their
enclosure by his own force, and so struggleth himself into the world by
conquest: And therefore that kind of birth is counted the nimbler and more
fortunate. But when the Child comes into the world thrusting his feet foremost,
says Pliny, the birth is counted unnatural, and those that are so born are
called L. 7. c. 8.
Agrippae, quasi aegre parti, born with much difficulty: For their birth is
slow and painful. And yet notwithstanding in abortment, and where the foetus is
dead, or that there would be a hard delivery any other way, so that there is
necessity of handiwork in the business, the more convenient way of coming
forth, is with the feet foremost; for by that means the streights of the Uterus
are opened, as it were by a Wedge. Wherefore when the hope of delivery relieth
chiefly upon the foetus, (as being strong and lively) we must endeavor to
further his coming out with his head fore-most; but in case the task is like
to depend upon the Uterus, we must procure his coming out with his feet
fore-most.

That the assistance of the foetus is chiefly required in the birth, is
evident, not in Birds only, which do by their own industry without the help of
their Parent break up the shell; but also in other Animals; for all Flies, and
Butterflies, do perforate the little membranes (in which they did lurk when
they were the Worm Aurelia) and likewise the Silkworm does at his appointed
time mollify and erode the little Silken bag, which he had weaved for his
defense and security, and so gets out without any foreign aid. And in like
manner, Wasps, Beetles, and other Insects; and all Fishes, are borne without
others helps; as does chiefly appear in the Raie, the Fork-fish, the Lamprey,
and all cartilagineous Fishes, which do conceive their Eggs within themselves,
and those perfect ones, and party-colored, (being furnished with a Yolk and
White) and concluded in a strong cartilagineous quadrangular shell: out of
which being detained within the Belly and the Uterus, they do form their young;
which breaking open the shell by force, do get abroad: as also the young
Vipers, by their erosion of the membrane which contains the Egg, do
sometimes in their Mothers Bowels, and sometimes as they stick in the very
passage, and other times at the end of two or three days after their nativity,
expose themselves to the wide World. From whence that Fable, that the Vipers do
eat their way through their Mothers bowels, and so revenge the death of their
Father, took its foundation: When yet they do no more then all other issues
which come into the world, breaking through the membranes which encompass them,
either in their very Birth it self, or a little after it.

But how great furtherance the foetus does confer to its own Birth, several
observations do clearly evince. A certain Woman here amongst us (I speak it
knowingly) was, (being dead over night) left alone in her Chamber: but the next
morning an Infant was there found between her Legs, which had by his own force
wrought his release. Gregorius Nymmanus, has collected certain examples of
this nature out of approved Authors.

I also knew a Woman, who had all the interior part of the neck of her Womb
excoriated and torn, by a difficult and painful delivery: so that her time of
Lying in being over, though she proved with Child again afterward, yet not
only the sides of the Orifice of the Neck of the Womb near the Nymphae did
close together, but all the whole Cavity thereof, even to the inner Orifice of
the Matrix, whereby there was no entrance even for a small probe, nor yet any
egress to her usual fluxes. Hereupon the time of her delivery being now
arrived, the poor soul was lamentably tortured, and laying aside all
expectation of being delivered, she resigned up her keys to her Husband, and
setting her affairs in order, she took leave of all her friends. When behold,
beyond expectation, by the strong contest of a very lusty Infant, the whole
tract was forced open, and she was miraculously delivered; the lusty Child
proving the author of his own, and his Parents life, leaving the passage open
for the rest of his Brethren who should be borne in time to come. For, proper
applications being administered, his Mother was restored to her former health.

I shall add one example more memorable then this. The Queen had an exceeding
white Mare, excellently shaped, presented unto her: whose genitall parts (lest
by going to Horse she might endanger the beauty of her proportions, and become
unfit for use) were, as the custom is, locked up all with iron rings.
Notwithstanding which, this Mare (by what accident I cannot tell, nor could the
Grooms inform me) was made big with Foale: and at last, when they feared no
such matter, she foaled by night, and the Foale was found alive next morning by
the mares side. When I came to hear thereof, I went presently to the Stables,
and saw both the labia of the lap, which were locked up with rings, and all the
privity toward the left side, so torn and dilacerated from the right
haunch-bone, that the unity of that most tight part being dissolved, by the
incredible force of the young Foale, he might easily find a passage through
that wide gap. So forcible is the vigor and efficacy of a mature and lively
Foetus.

But on the contrary, in case the Foetus be sickly, and languishing, or borne
before its time; it is not properly a birth, but an abortment: and the Foetus
is rather ejected, then borne: and therefore though he be now some days old,
he will neither take the breast kindly, nor deposite his excrements as he ought
to do.

And yet the Uterus has its share in this business of Delivery: as shall
appear in the following example. A poor woman, who was a Laundress, did for a
long time labor under the Bearing down, or precipitation of her womb, and the
sheath thereof did hang down to the bigness of ones fist, and at length, using
no applications to it, her grief grew so forcible upon her, that it now begun
to resemble a Scrotum, the skin being rugged and squalid; and yet found now
less pain or trouble in it, then she was formerly used to find, when it newly
bore down. But, she asking my advice, I counseled her to keep her Bed for some
certain days, and to mollify the dryer parts thereof with fomentations, and
ointments, and so when her womb was reduced into her body, to keep it still up
with pessaries and swathes, till by the use of drying and strengthening
remedies it was confirmed and settled in its proper place. The cure did for some
time succeed to our wish; but she being poor, was fain to fall to her calling
again, to get money, and so intermitting her appointed applications, she fell
into a relapse, and endured it pretty well, her womb sometimes retiring back
again, and sometimes continuing quite out; but for the most part, at night she
did reduce it, and there it remained for some time. But after many days, she
addressed her self to me again, complaining that her womb being swelled by the
use of her remedies, and especially of her fomentations (as she conceived)
would now no longer abide in her body. And yet applying some ointments which I
had prescribed, she had forced it in again, but her cure did not continue
long: for no sooner did she rise, and stand upon her legs, and so go about
her work, but her womb did presently, by reason of its bulk and weight,
disturb her again, and would easily bear down upon any occasion. And now at
this time it was as large as a Bulls Cod, dangling between her legs,: so that
I suspected, that not only the sheath, but that the womb it self was now
inverted, or else that she was diseased with a Uterine Hernia, or rupture. It
grew at last bigger then a man's head, being then a hard tumor, and hanging
down to her knees did much pain her, so that she could not go (but upon all
four) and breaking just in the bottom of it, it did effund a moisture (as if
it had been an Ulcer) and blood with it. Looking upon it (for I did not explore
it by touch) I did suspect it to be a Cancer of the womb, and therefore did
bethink my self of a Ligature, and cutting it off: and in the interim, I
advised her to apply gentle fomentations to it to assuage the pain. But the
following night, an Infant perfectly shaped, of a span long, was cast out of
that Tumor, but it was dead; and the next morning they brought it to me; which
having embowelled, I kept swimming in cold water without corrupting for some
months time, showing it to many of my friends (as a miraculous spectacle.) The
skin in this Foetus was not yet formed; but only a thin paring appeared (such
as lies about a Codlin) which I easily drew away whole and entire; whereupon
all the muscles disclosed themselves very distinctly, (for the Foetus was
lean.) What other matters I observed in the dissection of this Foetus, shall
be related elsewhere: in this place, I thought it only convenient to signify,
how the Matrix it self alone did promote this Abortive, and did eject this
Foetus by its own industry.

Fabricius does propose two things worthy admiration De form. foet. page 142.
(as he says) in the birth, and after it: the first is concerning the
dilatation of the Uterus in the Birth: and the other is, of the reduction of
the Uterus after the Birth into its former compass and narrowness: Wondering
that the womb should be so much distended to make way for the foetus, and that
in a short time after delivery, it should retire into its pristine dimension.

How the Neck of the Womb, which is thick, hard, and so shut up, that it will
not admit a slender probe, should subscribe to so vast a distention in the time
of Delivery, We may with Galen De us. part. l. 15. c. 7. page 143.
admire, says he, but we shall never comprehend it.

Yet he gives this Reason for it, namely That the Uterus, while it is not
pregnant, is a thick and hard body, so likewise is its orifice; but being
impregnated, it becomes soft and thin: and the nearer it draws to delivery, so
much the more is the substance, and by consequence its orifice too, made
thinner, and softer. And this he conceives to be effected by its distention;
which being distended, its compact and complicated body (if he may so speak) is
expanded and smoothed, and so, though it was thick and hard before, yet now it
is rendered thin and soft, and so consequently fit to afford an exit to the
foetus. And afterward he says, There was one, who once enquired of me, how,
if it be so indeed, it can be true that in women with child the orifice of the
womb is so occluded, that not so much as a small probe can get into it? I make
answer, that it came to be so, in that the womb while it is distended, and is
unfolded like a linen cloth that is compacted and folded up together, does
begin to be raised up first in its upper part, and there to be unfolded, and
after it the lower parts do by degrees begin to distend, till at the last that
distending faculty does arrive at the very orifice of the womb it self; which
is convenient to be so then, when the Uterus is inclining toward delivery.
Wherefore the Orifice of the womb is deservedly shut for the first months,
(whilst it is crass and obdurate) but in the last dilated. And thus much
touching Galens unknown cause: we might also add other Reasons, whereby the
dilatation of the womb becomes more easy, as, suppose, the Excrements of the
Foetus, namely the Sweat and the Urine: which though they are contained in
their own proper membranes and receptacles, yet may the power of Humectation
arrive even unto this Orifice, especially since it is placed below, and near to
these humors, being always present with them. Add also moreover, that a
certain mucous and pituitous substance is always found about the orifice of
the womb.

But, in my opinion, this worthy man is mistaken; for the Neck of the womb is
not hard by complication, but of its own essence, and nervous constitution: and
likewise, those accidental Causes (which he alleges) are of little advantage
to this purpose. For, doubtless, this is done by the Divine Providence of
Nature (as well as the rest of the wonderful Fabric of the Body) which does
direct her workmanship to a certain End, Action, and Use. The Wombs
constitution therefore is such, that in the first Conception it should have its
nervous Orifice constringed, for retention sake, which afterward in the
delivery of the foetus (like the fruit in the Tree) does of hard become soft
and mellow, for the convenience of expulsion: and that not from any unfolding,
but from the alteration of its Temper; for even the connection of the bones
themselves, namely the Synchondrosis of the Haunch-bone with the Share, and
Holy-bone, and the synneuresis or natural union or coalition of the Rump, or
utmost end of the Os Sacrum is dissolved and mollified. It is indeed a
wonderful thing, that the little bud of a growing Nut (as suppose of the Kernel
of an Almond, or other Fruit) should break those bones which a Malet can hardly
bruise: and that the tender fibers of the Ivy-root crawling along the narrow
chinks or crannies of stones, should at last demolish large walls. But it is
nothing so wonderful, that the genital parts of Women which are relaxed in the
birth, should afterward harden, and draw themselves together, because it is
natural to those parts; especially if we consider that the Yard of the Male is
in coition very much stretched, and hardened, and anon does flagge, and soften.
We are more to admire (which is beyond all plicature or folding) that the
substance of the Uterus is not only daily amplified and distended, according
to the growth of the foetus, (as if it were, according to the opinion of
Fabricius, unfolded) but does grow thicker, more carnous, and stronger then
before. That indeed is more wonderful; yet, as Fabricius admireth it, that the
so large bulk of the Uterus should in so few days space, by the customary
purgations of Childbed, return to its pristine dimensions: since it is not so
in other ^umours and impostumations: which consisting of praeternatural, and
digestive faculties, which rebel against the expulsive, are longer under cure.
And yet this is no more admirable, then the other works of Nature; for all
things are filled with the Deity, and the God of Nature displayeth himself in
all things.

In the last place, Fabricius does most admire, that those Vessels of the
Embryo (namely the Oval perforation out of the Hollow-vein into the Venal
Artery, and the passage from the Arterial Vein into the Aorta; (whereof we
have treated at large, in our Tract of the Circulation of the Blood) should
presently after the birth wither, and be obliterated, and is enforced to betake
himself to that reason cited by us before out of Aristotle; namely, that all
parts are constituted for some Action ot other, De part. an. l. 1. c. 5.
and that Action being taken away, the parts also themselves do vanish. As the
Eye sees, the Ear hears, the Brain perceives, the Stomach concocteth; not
because they are endowed with such a kind of temper and fabric; but those
organs are therefore endowed with such a kind of temper and fabric, that so
they may perform the Functions assigned them by Nature.

By which argument it appears, that the Uterus is the chiefest of the Parts
dedicated to Generation: for the Testicles are constituted for the geniture or
seed; but the seed for coition; and coition it self, or emission of seed, that
the Uterus may receive fecundity, and so generation ensue thereby.

We have formerly said, that the Egg is as it were the fruit of Animals, and
as it were an exposed Womb. Now on the contrary, we shall contemplate the
Uterus as an Egg residing within. For as Trees, at set times, do flourish with
leaves, flowers, and fruits: and Oviparous Animals do sometimes generate eggs,
and lay; but sometimes they grow emerit, and the place or part which did
contain them is not to be found: so also Viviparous Animals have their Spring,
and Autumn. At the Seasons of fecunditie and generation, the Genital parts,
especially in Females, are very much altered: insomuch that the Ovary in Birds,
which at other times is conspicuous, does then appear something turgid: and the
Belly of Fishes, about the time of Spawning, does much exceed all the rest of
their body, by reason of the multitude of their eggs, and affluence of their
seed or spawne. In many Viviparous Animals, the Genitals (namely the Uterus,
and Spermatical Vessels) are perceived to be at some times of a diverse
Constitution, Temper, and Fabric; but as they grow pregnant, or forbear to be
so, so do they diversely change; so that a man can hardly know them for the same
things. For as in Nature nothing is wanting, so there is no superfluity. And
therefore the Genital parts, when there is no more use of them, do wither, are
retracted, and as it were obliterated and expunged.

At the times of Coition, the Testicles are conspicuous in male Hares, and
Moles, and the Horns are then visible in the Uterus of their females. It were
strange to relate, how great an affluence of seed is then conspicuous in the
larger sort of Moles, and Mice, in which at other times no seed at all is to be
seen (but their Testicles are extenuated and retracted into their Bellies) but
when they forgo impregnation, there is hardly any such thing as a Uterus to be
perceivd: insomuch that it is a difficult matter to distinguish Male from Femal.

The Womb does, chiefly in Women, exceedingly vary both in Temper, as also in
those Adjuncts which follow the Temper (namely Situation, Magnitude, Figure,
Color, Thickness, Hardness, and Density.) Unripe Virgins, as their Breasts are
no bigger then the Breasts of Boys; so is their Uterus very small, white, of a
skinny substance, destitute of Veins, and in magnitude, not exceeding the top
of ones Thumb, or a large Bean. So also ancient Women, as their breasts do
sink, so have they a retreated, flaggy, lank, pallid Womb, void of Veins and
Blood. Which I also conceive to be the cause, why Women growing Ancient have
not their monthly Terms: but that they descend into the Haemorrhoides, or else
do abruptly forsake them, and so endanger their health. But when the Womb is
now chill, and as it were defunct, and all the Veins and Arteries thereof are
expunged, the superfluous blood, when it boileth, does either restagnate, or
divert its course into the neighboring Haemorrhoids. But on the contrary, in
pale Virgins, and such as have the Green sickness (whose Womb is slender, and
their Terms are at a stay) by Coition with the Male, says Aristotle, De genesis
an. l. 3. c. 1.
the excrement of the Terms is drawn down, for the Uterus being tepefied, does
attract the humors, and the passages are opened. Whereupon a vast abatement of
their distemper does ensue: for the Womb being unmindefull of his function,
many mischiefs do befall the Body in general: because the Womb is a principal
part, which does easily draw the whole body into consent with it. No man (who
is but never so little versed in such matters) is ignorant, what grievous
Symptoms, the Rising, Bearing down, and Perversion, and Convulsion of the Womb
do excite; what horrid extravagancies of mind, what Phrensies, Melancholy
Distempers, and Outragiousness, the praeternatural Diseases of the Womb do
induce, as if the affected Persons were enchanted: as also how many difficult
Diseases, the depraved effluxion of the Terms, or the use of Venus much
intermitted, and long desired do foment. Nor is it less known, how great an
Alteration does befall Virgins, when their Uterus does enlarge, and is
tepefied, for they grow mature, and their Complexion does improve; their
Breasts strut forth, they become more beautiful, their Eyes glisten, their
Voice is more tunable, their Gate, Gesture, and Discourse, are more graceful
then formerly; and their more grievous Distempers are at this time, or never,
cured.

I knew a noble Lady, which was wild by reason of a Uterine Melancholy and
Distemper, for above ten years together: and when all Remedies had been in vain
employed, she fell at last into the Bearing down of the Uterus; which accident,
contrary to others judgment, I did prognosticate would conduce to her health;
and persuaded her not to return her womb, until its distemper was assuaged by
the outward cold air: the success was answerable to my persuasion, and in a
short time she was perfectly cured; and her womb being at last restored to its
seat, did remain there, and she lives a healthy life, even to this day.

I knew another Woman, which was troubled with Hysterical symptoms, such as no
Applications could subdue; who at length after many years was cured by the
Bearing down of the Womb. And both these being relieved in their Symptoms, I
did restore their wombs to their places with happy success. For the Uterus
being by any sharp humor excited violently to expulsion, does not only gently
bear down, but (like unto the Right Gut when it is irritated by a troublesome
Tenesmus) does precipitate it self outward.

Diverse therefore is the Constitution of the Uterus; and that not only
praeternatural, but natural also, namely, in the time of Fecundity, and
Barrenness. In young Girls, and Women past Childing, it is (as I have said) of
the magnitude of a Bean, and without any blood: in a Virgin ripe for a husband,
it resembles the bulk and form of a Pear: in fruitful Women, and such as are
apt to conceive, it is as large as a small Gourd, or a Goose-egge; and does
likewise swell as the breasts do, and growing more laxe and fleshy, it
becomes warm; and as Virgil speaks of the Fields,

-- superat tener omnibus humor,
-- and genitalia semina poscunt:
They all a flowing moisture have,
And so a fruitful seed do crave.
Wherefore their Terms being now at hand, or newly over, whilst the warmth and
moisture of the Part (which are two necessary causes of Generation) do remain,
Women are most apt to conceive. And so other Animals likewise (when they are
excited to Venery) their Genital parts are moist, turgid, and swelled.

And this Constitution I have found in the Womb, before the Birth. But in Women
with Child, the Uterus (as has been said) does extend according to the growth
of the Infant, and so enlarges into a vast proportion. I have found it
presently after Delivery, of the bigness of ones head, and thicker then the
middlefingers breadth, and fraught with diverse vessels full of blood. It is
indeed a wonderful thing, and (as Fabricius notes) does much exceed our humane
apprehension, that the so vast bulk of the Uterus should so much lessen, in so
short a space, namely in the space of fifteen, or twenty days.

For no sooner is the foetus and the After-burden excluded, but the Uterus does
by degrees gather it self together, streighteneth its Neck, and retreateth it
self toward the interior parts; being partly insensibly abated by a
diaphoresis, and partly dissolved into the Purgations: and all the bordering
parts, the bones, belly, and all the Hypogastrical region, are together
contracted, and grow sirme again. In the Purgations, first of all pure blood,
then corrupt blood, like that Water wherein flesh that is newly killed is
washed, and then paler blood does issue forth: our women do call it lact is
proventum, the coming of the Milk, when their purgations are now no longer
died with blood; because perhaps, the Milk does at that time flow more
plenteous, and sound for the Infant, from the breasts; and the purgations do
then begin to diminish, and dry away: the alible juice being now translated
from the Uterus to the breasts.

And yet other Animals do not require so great trouble in the business, for the
foresaid parts in them are, in the compass of a day or two, quite restored,
and perfectly consolidated. Nay some of them (as the Hare, and the Coney) in
the space of an hour after they have kindled, do admit the Buck, and are again
fructified by Coition. As we have showed that the Hen so soon as ever she has
laid, is compressed by the Cock. But Women alone, as they only have Terms,
so do they abound with after-purgings, and do alone undergo difficult and
hazardous deliveries: because their Uterus does either unseasonably gather it
self together, by reason of weakness, or else the After-purgings are depraved
contrary to nature, or do not come away kindly. For it often befalls Women
(especially the more tender sort) that the After-purgings being corrupted, and
grown noisome within, do call in Fevers, and other grievous Symptoms. For the
Womb being excoriated by the separation of the After-burden (especially if the
separation were violent) like a large inward Ulcer, is cleansed and mundified
by the liberal emanations of the After-purgings. And hereupon we conclude of
the welfare or danger of a Woman in Childbed, according to her excretions. If
any part of the After-burden be left sticking to the Uterus, the After-purgings
will flow forth evil-sented, green, and as if they proceeded from a dead body:
and sometimes the courage and strength of the womb being quite vanquished, a
sudden Gangrene does induce a certain death.

In case any Clotted Blood, or any other preternatural matter, do remain in the
cavity of the womb after the Delivery; the Womb will neither retire upwards,
nor close its Orifice, but its Neck will continue soft and open: As I have had
experience in a Woman, which lying very sick of a Malignant Fever, and being
very weak, did suffer an Abortion: who after the exclusion of the Foetus; which
was incorrupt and entire, yet lay exceeding weak with a disorderly Pulse, and
in a cold sweat, as if she were a dying. I perceived the Orifice of her Womb
was lax, soft, and very open, and her After-purgings were something noisome:
whereupon I suspected that something did lurk in her Womb which did putrefie:
and putting in my hand, I extracted a false Conception, as big as a
Goose-egge; which was made of a most thick, nervous, and almost gristly
substance, having some perforations in it: (whereout did issue a viscid and
putrefied matter) and immediately upon this she was discharged of those
grievous Symptoms, and suddenly after did perfectly recover.

When the Neck of the Womb does a little contract it self, and thereupon the
Clotted Blood does get out, though not without pain and difficulty, causing
those pains, which our Midwives call the After-throws: the danger is then
supposed to be over, and indeed it is usually so; because it is a sign of the
strength and firmness of the Uterus, collecting it self easily together;
whereby the After-purgings are more readily expelled, and the Woman is the
sooner well.

But I have known the Orifice of the Womb draw together so close in some
immediately after the delivery, that the Blood being detained in the Womb, and
thereupon suddenly putrefying and thickening into Clots, did induce most
grievous Symptoms; and when no means would avail to unburden them, a present
death insued.

A very Honorable Lady in Childbed falling into a fever (by reason no
After-purgings came from her) had her Privities swollen, and scortching: the
Orifice of her Matrix being hard, and shut up, I did open it a little way by
force with an Iron Instrument, that so I might immit an Injection by a little
Syringe; whereupon black, clotted, and noisome blood did issue out, even to
some certain pounds weight, whereby she received present ease.

The Wife of a Doctor of Divinity, who was of a good habit of Body enough, but
being Barren, did consult me; and being very desirous of Children, she had
tried many Medicines, and Physicians, but all to no purpose: she had her Terms
at the usual times; but sometimes (especially when she had rod on Horseback)
some corrupt and purulent substance did issue from her: Which presently after
would stop again. Some conceived it to be the Whites: others suspected it to be
some deep Ulcer: being persuaded thereunto, chiefly, because her flux was not
constant, and by little and little, but by certain Intervalls, and much at a
time: Whereupon by the help of a Speculum Matricis they did survey all the
sheath of the Uterus, and did apply several Medicines, but all in vain. At last
I, being called, did open the inward Orifice of the Womb, and presently there
did issue forth to the quantity of two spoonfulls, of corrupt matter, sprinkled
with bloody streaks. Which when I perceived, I told them that there lay an
Ulcer lurking in the cavity of her Womb; and by injecting proper Medicaments, I
restored her to her former health. But being intent upon the cure, and seeing
the ordinary remedies did little avail, I applied more forcible ones; because I
suspected that the Ulcer was inveterate (and perhaps with flesh growing upon
it) wherefore to my former injections, I added a little Roman Vitriol; by whose
acrimony the Uterus being extimulated, did grow so hard, that it did seem as
hard to the touch as a Stone: and occasioned several Hysterical Symptoms
withal; which Physicians commonly conceive to proceed from the suffocation of
the Matrix, and foul vapors being thence sent upwards. This inconvenience
continued a while; till the Uterus being assuaged by milder applications, and
such as abate pains, did relax its Orifice again, and did exclude the sharp
liquour which I had injected, together with a putrid matter. Whereby the
Patient was in a short time restored.

I conceived it convenient to transfer this History out of my Medicinal
Observations, to this place, that it may evidently appear, of how sharp and
quick a sense the Uterus is: and how easily it does close it self upon the
presence of its adverversary: especially in a grievous and difficult Lying in.
Now these casualties are most incident to Women above all other Creatures, and
of them, to those that are tenderly brought up, and do lead a sedentary and
lazy life; as also to such as are of a sickly constitution, and do easily fall
into distempers.

For Country Women, and such as take great pains, are not so dangerously ill,
upon so small grounds. Some of these will be with Child again within a months
time: when as the other are often out of order for two years after.

Hippocrates allotteth as many days for the Afpurgings, as for the formation
of the foetus; and therefore I. de foetu.
more for a female, then a male Child. But that, witness Scaliger, is false:
For none of our Women are purged above a month after their delivery: many Com.
in hist. an. Arist. l. 7. c. 3.
not beyond fifteen days: and some but seven: nay I have known a Woman, who
was cleansed in three days, even after she had brought forth Twins. Galen has
many things concerning this subject, in his Book (...). The Women (as the
report goes) in the Newfound Land, keep close the day of their delivery; but
the next day return to their ordinary emploiments.

I will only add, for conclusion, a memorable relation, delivered to me from
the Noble Lord George Carew, Baron of Tatnes, and for a long time President of
Munster in Ireland, who also wrote the Annals of those times. There was a Woman
big with Child, which followed her Husband, who was a Soldier in the Army;
and the Army being daily in motion, was it seems forced to make a Halt, by
reason of a little River that run cross the place whether they intended to
March: whereupon the poor woman finding her labor come upon her, retired to
the next thicker, and alone by her self, without any Midwife, or other
preparation, brought forth Twins: which she presently carried to the River, and
there washed both her self and them; which done, she wrapped her Infants into a
course cloth, and tied them to her back, and that very day, marched along with
the Army twelve mile together, barefooted: and was never the worse for the
matter.

The next day after, the Deputy of Ireland, the Lord Montioy (who at that time
was General of the Army against the Spaniards, at the siedge of Kingsale) and
the President of Munster, being affected at the strangeness of the story, did
both vouchsafe to be Godfathers to the Infants.

Of the Membranes and Humors of the Uterus.
HIeronymus Fabricius recounteth four sorts of bodies, Lib. de for. foetus c. 1.
which do consist without the Foetus, namely the Umbilical Vessels, the
Membranes, Humors, and fleshy substance. Concerning which, I shall briefly
declare, wherein I differ in opinion from him, (by the instigation of several
Observations) but first I shall succinctly lay down his opinion.

There are, says he, three Membranes, two whereof do encompass the Infant
throughout, but the third does not. Of those which do incompass the Foetus, one
is the interior, called (...) id est, amiculum, the little covering. The other
is placed next to the former, and called in Greek (...), in Latin, Innominata,
the coat without a name (but it is by Interpreters falsely called Secundae, or
Secundina, the Secundine) and this also does encompass the whole Foetus. The
third is called (...), id est, Intestinalis, the Gut-like Membrane, because it
is like a stuffed Gut, or Pudding: which therefore does not encompass the
Foetus, but lies over part of the breast and lower belly, and is extended to
each horn of the Uterus. He does confess that this Membrane is only to be
found in a Lamb, and a Calfe; and says that it is joined to the Uterus, and
does by the Urachus receive the Urine of the foetus from the Bladder. And
therefore, says he, In Horned beasts, which cap. 7.
have this coat called Allantoides, the Urachus is so large, and strait, that
it resembles a Gut; growing by degrees lesser and lesser, even till it reach
to the bottom of the bladder: which does easily evince that its original is
rather from the Allantoides, then from the Bladder. But in a Man, and other
Animals which have teeth in both Jaws, the forementioned largeness of the
Urachus is so small, that whereas it rises single from the bottom of the
Bladder, it is presently after divided into most slender fibers, which passing
along with the Umbilical Vessels, do transfund the Urine into the coat Chorion
(in an almost invisible manner.) And upon this ground he does challenge
Arantius of a double error; both in that he denied any Urachus to be found in
a humane foetus; and likewise for saying, that it does discharge its Urine
through its privy member.

But for my part, I confess my self to be involved in the same errors with
Arantius (if at least they be errors.) For I am sure of this, that if you
compress the bladder of a large-grown foetus, (be it the humane foetus, or of
any other Animal) the Urine will start out at the Privities. But as for the
Urachus, I never yet saw any such thing, nor could ever observe that upon
compression of the bladder, the Urine would gush out into the Secundines. I
have indeed in Sheep and Deer, seen a certain Process of the bladder, which
does contain Urine in it; but never saw any such as the Urachus by him
described.

And yet I will not too stiffly deny, that there is a Coat called Allantoides;
for the Interior membranes are so thin and transparent, (such as we have
signified to be found between the two whites of an Egg) that they may easily
impose upon the Eye. Likewise in a Hen-egg, between the Colliquamentum and the
White (that is, between the Amnion, and the Chorion) there is to be seen some
whitish excrements, nay, sometimes the very downright excrements of the Guts;
as we have formerly spoken, and Coiterus has also observed. Moreover, the
Membrane of the Colliquamentum it self (wherein the Chicken does swim) though
it be pellucid, thin, and so subtle, that (according to Fabricius his own
confession) thinner cannot be imagined: yet (since according to Him, all the
membranes though never so thin, are nevertheless double) Nature may possibly
sometimes upon necessity deposit the Urine, or some other excrement between the
Reduplications or folds thereof. And such a kind of Allantoides as this, I
shall willingly indulge to Fabricius: but as for any other kind of Pudding,
carried on to both the bornes of the Womb, I find no such thing in the
Secundines of Cloven-footed-beasts, nor any thing else, but the Conception it
self. I only find, (as I have said before) a kind of Process of the bladder,
which being seated between the Umbilical Arteries, does contain an
excrementitious humor, and this Process is in some longer, and in others
shorter.

Wherefore, in my judgment, the Coat which Fabricius calls Allantoides, is the
mere Chorion: and yet the Ancients called it Allantoides, from the figure of a
double-pudding, which it does resemble. For the exterior membrane, which (like
a Wallet tied in the middle) is extended to the extremities of each Horn; and
passing through the interposed part of the Uterus (or the connection of both the
Horns) is fastened together, is the Chorion; which, in Sheep, Goats, Hinds, and
Does, and other clovenfooted beasts, if you take it in your hand in the middle
of that passage, you may draw it away entire: and this we have called their
Egg, or Conception.

For it contains as an Egg does, a twofold liquor, a foetus, and all things
relating thereunto; and has the same qualifications which Aristotle assigns
to an Egg; namely, that out of part thereof an Animal ought to be constituted,
and that the remainder ought to become the support and sustenance of that
Animal, when it is now constituted.

And therefore that Coat which Fabricius calls Allantoides, I either conceive
to be the Choriou, or that something praeter-natural had befalne some Animal
which he had seen. For certain it is, that it is only to be found in some few
Animals, and not always in them neither: for at the Beginning it is not found,
and afterward, in some it is more, and in others less conspicuous, and in some
nothing at all is discernable, but merely a Process. And Fabricius himself
conceives it not useful to the encompassing of the Infant, but only to the
reception of the Urine. And truly I believe, that he makes mention of it,
rather in justification of the Doctrine of the Ancients, then that himself
found any such thing, or thought it useful to any intent. But (both with the
Ancients, and the whole School of Physicians) he does confess, that the Chorion
does contain Urine; where he says, that two humors are about the foetus, the
one being Sweat, which is in the Amnion, the other Urine, which is contained in
the Chorion.

By which it is manifest, that the Ancients understood one and the same
membrane under a double compellation; namely, in cloven-footed beasts, (in whom
alone it is found) they called it Allantoides, by reason of its figure: but in
other Animals, they called it Chorion, from its emploiment, because they
conceived it was designed for the entertainment of the Urine. And therefore
they confess that this Coat is neither found in a Man, nor any other Animals.
For what need of any other Coat to entertain the Urine, when that office, by
their own confession, is already executed by the Chorion? And indeed, there can
no probable reason be alleged why that coat should be found in Sheep, Goats,
and other beasts which cleave the hoof, and not also in Dogs, Cats, Mice, and
Others. For if it were instituted for the reception of the Urine, it is
necessary, that the foetus of Sheep, and Cowes, should either abound with
greater plenty of Urine then other animals which have Teeth in both Jaws; or
else, that there are three diverse kinds of humors; or at least two
Receptacles of the Urine. For this I am sure, that the Chorion is from the
first beginning full of water. But I do not here intend to dispute
controversies, I shall rather rehearse what I have found by experience.

It is one thing to exhibit the fabric of a Conception, or Embryo that is now
perfected, as Fabricius does: but another thing, to disclose the the generation
thereof, and first scheme and rudiments of all: as it is a diverse business to
describe Apples, or the ripe seeds of Plants, and their first production from
the bud. We therefore will briefly relate, how the Conception is framed by
little and little, even from the beginning to the end; that it may thence more
likely appear, what we are to conclude concerning the Membranes, and other
Appurtenances relating to the Foetus.

All Living things do derive their Original (as we have said) from something,
which does contain in it both the matter, and efficient virtue and power: which
therefore is that thing, both out of which, and by which, whatsoever is born,
does deduce its beginning. And such an Original or Rudiment in Animals (whether
they proceed from other Animals which do beget them, or else are spontaneous,
and the Issues of Putrefaction) is a certain humor, which is concluded in some
certain coat, or shell; namely, a similar body, having life actually in it, or
in potentia: and this, in case it be generated within an Animal, and do there
remain, until it have produced an Univocal Animal, is commonly called a
Conception: but if it be exposed without, by being born, or else assume its
beginning elsewhere, it is called either an Egg, or a Worm. But I conceive that
both ought alike to be called Primordium, the first Rudiment from which an
Animal does spring; as Plants assume their nativity from the Seed: and all
these Primordia are of one kind, namely, Vital.

And this kind of Rudiment I find in the Vterus of all Viviparous Animals,
before any part of the foetus appear; namely, there is a clear, stiff, white
humor (like the white of an Egg) which is included in a membrane, which I
call their egg: and this does fill up all the Vterus, and both the Horns
thereof, in Hindes, Does, Sheep, and other Beasts which cleave the Hoof.

In process of Time, there is a most pure, and clear watery part distinguished
or severed from the rest of the Rudiment, or egg, which we call the
Colliquamentum, or dissolved part in a Hen-egge) and this does in brightness or
perspicuity far exceed all the rest of the egg (in which it is comprehended.
The form thereof is round, and it is concluded in its own proper membrane,
which is most thin and transparent, which they call Amnion; as for the rest of
the humor, which is thicker and darker then this, an exterior coat, which is
contiguous to the concave superficies of the Vterus, and embraces the whole
Egg, does contain it: which obtains a several figure, according to the
diversity of the shape of the womb: for in some it is oval, in other oblong,
but in Beasts which cleave the hoof, it resembles a Wallet.

A little while after, there does appear in this crystal Colliquamentum, Punctum
rubrum saliens, A Red leaping Point; from which most slender strings of little
Veins are disseminated, like rays or beams. Anon the first concrement or
substance of the Body does appear, like a Magot, which is bent like a Keel of a
Ship: and so the rest of the Parts do follow in their order, as has been
related in our History. For we have observed that the Procreation of the foetus
in Viviparous Animals is instituted in the same manner out of the Egg or
Conception, as the Chicken out of the Henn-Egg.

But these Viviparous conceptions do (as I have noted) differ in Figure,
Number, and Connection to the Vterus. For at the beginning, the Conception
(especially in those that cleave the hoof) does not grow to the Vterus; but
being only contiguous thereunto, does fill up all its cavity, and distend it,
and may be easily drawn out whole.

In such Creatures as cleave the hoof, (which do conceive in the Horns of the
Womb) and also in those that are whole-hoofed, there is only one of these eggs
found at a time, and that also extending it self to both the Horns, and
though sometimes they do produce a single, and sometimes a double foetus; and
thereupon have sometimes one single Colliquamentum, and sometimes two (namely,
one in the Right, and another in the Left Horn) yet are they still concluded in
that Common Egg or Conception.

But in other Animals, so many foetus, so many several Eggs are to be seen
apart; and as many Colliquamentums in them, as it is in the Dog, the Cat, the
Mouse, and such like Animals as have teeth in both their Jaws.

The Figure of the Conception in such as cleave the hoof, is like a Wallet;
namely such, as Fabricius does attribute to the Allantoides. In a Mare, the
internal shape of the womb resembles a little oblong Sack; but in a Woman, it
is Orbicular.

In those Animals, whose conception does cleave to their womb (which, truly, is
not so in many, until the foetus be fully formed) it is distinguished by its
Diversity of Connection: for in some, it does stick only in one place, by the
mediation of a carnous substance, which we call Placenta, the Uterine cake in
women, because it resembles the round figure of a Cake; but in others, it
grows to the Uterus in several places, being fastened thereunto by diverse
fleshy substances, or caruncles: namely, by five, in Hindes, and Does; by more
in Cowes, but they are lesser also: but in the race of Sheep, by very many, and
those of different magnitude. In Dogs and Cats, these Carnous Bodies, do (like
a girdle) encompass every conception round. A like substance does in Hares, and
Moles, grow to the sides of their Uterus: as also the Uterine cake in a woman,
which embraces more then one half of the conception (as the cups do the
Acorns, when they first spring) and therefore the gibbous part thereof does
stick fast to the womb, but the hollow part does grow to the Chorion.

These things being premised, we shall now disclose, what our judgment is of
these Humors, membranes, fleshy substance, and also of the distribution of the
Vmbilical vessels (which are spoken of by Fabricius.)

Fabricius does rightly understand by the words (...) and (...), the
Secundines, or After-Burden, cap. 5.
namely not the Membranes only, but all that which does come away last in the
delivery (or at lest, not long after it) and is constituted of humors,
membranes, and fleshy substance, as also of the Vmbilical Vessels.

But as for what he relates concerning the humors, Of the Humors.
which as he supposes he does receive from the Ancients (as a thing most sure,
and which stands in no need of any proof) namely, that the water in the
Amnion, wherein the foetus swimmes, is its sweat; and that that outward Water
in the Chorion is the Urine, are both incongruous, and false assertions: For
both those two humors do appear in the conception before any portion of the
foetus it self be in being: and that which he calls the Urine, is before that
(which they conceive to be the sweat.) Nay you may find these humors,
especially the last, in some barren, and unfruitful conceptions (wherein there
is no tract of a foetus at all.)

Such Conceptions as these, or Subventaneous eggs, Women do sometimes eject:
and Aristotle says De genesis an. l. 3. c. 9. Ibid.
thy are called, Fluxus, Emanations or Fluxes, but we call them false
conceptions, and slips. Such an egg as these, did Hippocrates shake from his
aborting Minstrel. For those creatures which do breed an Animal within
themselves, have in some sort after their first conception, something like an
egg within them, for a humor is contained in a thin membrane, just as if you
should pluck the shell off of the egg. But as for that humor contained in the
Chorion, which Fabricius and other Physicians conceive to be the Urine,
Aristotle seems to apprehend it to be the liquour of the Sperme, or Geniture.
For, he says, Hist. an. l. 7. c. 7.
The seed being received by the Uterus, having continued in it a while, is
covered with a membrane. For if it chance to fall out, before any
dearticulation, or delineation of the parts do appear, it looks like an egg
covered with a membrane, when the shell is pilled off. But that membrane is
full of Veins, namely, the Chorion, which has assumed its denomination a
venarum choro, sive copia, from the conflux or multitude of veins.

I have often seen those kind of eggs ejected in the second, or third month:
they are many times corrupt and rotten within, and do steal out insensibly
(like the Whites) and so delude those, who have entertained hopes of a true
conception.

Again, those forementioned humors cannot be conceived to be sweat, or Urine:
because they abound in such plenty at the very beginning, that the Embryo
swimming in the midst thereof, is thereby secured (whilst his Mother
runs, or danceth, or does imply her body by any forcible agitation) from the
collision of the circumjacent parts, as it were by a fortress.

Add to all this, that many Animals never sweat at all: (when yet according to
Aristotle, all Water, Land, and Volatile Animals, and I shall put in creeping
things, and Insects also, whether they be produced in the shape of an egg, or
an Animal, or else be spontaneous productions, are all procreated after a like
manner) all fowl, creeping things, and fishes, are conceived neither to Sweat,
nor Urine. Ibid.
The Dog, and Cat, do never sweat; nor any other Animal, while it does emit
abundance of Urine. And certainly it is impossible, that any Animal should make
water, before the Reins and Bladder are made.

Besides, which is a more evincing Argument then the rest, these humors cannot
be excrementitious, because so many little filaments of Veins are disseminated
into them: which do derive Aliment from thence (as from a large stock) and
afterward conduct it unto the foetus.

Again, if the humor contained in the Chorion, be the Urine; what need is
there of the Allantoides? and if the humor contained in the Amnion be the
Sweat, why did nature, who is so exact in all her contrivances, order the
matter so ill, as to condemn the foetus to lie wallowing in its own Excrement?
and why does the Parent presently after delivery (for that is usual with
several creatures) devour that which is but the Excrement of her foetus,
together with the membranes which contein it, with so much greediness and
appetite? Some have observed, that if the Animal do not eat up these membranes
and humors, it will not give down its Milk freely.

If, notwithstanding all these arguments, some men will still maintain that
these humors (which we dispose to the nutriment of the foetus) are
excrementitious; and that upon this inducement, viz. because they also improve
according to the growth of the foetus: and that in the birth of some Animals
(at which time the whole stock of Aliment is in probability almost consumed)
great store of these humors does abound; and that therefore they must needs
perform other offices, then can well consist with the dignity of the
nutriment. Yet for all this, I confidently pronounce, that these humors are
the Aliment of the foetus from the beginning of all; (as the Colliquamentum and
the White do serve the Chicken for the same purpose) but in process of time,
the thinner, and purer parts being exhausted, the relics do then put on the
nature of an useful excrement: and are reserved in some Animals, that so they
may secure the foetus and facilitate the delivery. For as Wine, when the
Spirits are exhaled, turns into deadwine: and as several Excrements do result
from the relics of the Aliment: so in like manner, when all that substance,
which is commodious to the sustenance of the foetus, is derived out of the
humor concluded in the Chorion; the remainder does turn into a kind of
excrement, and is reserved for the uses aforesaid. But all that humor which
was included in the Amnion, it commonly spent near the approaching delivery; so
that it is probable, that the foetus desires to get out by reason his
provisions fail him.

Lastly, if at any time there be any other humor contained in the Allantoides
(as indeed there sometimes is) I esteem it to be a preter-natural humor. For I
have seen when women at their delivery have had a mighty flux of water; and
sometimes a twofold water: our Midwives call them the By-waters. And therefore
some women have a monstrous great belly, though they are brought to bed of a
very little and lean Child; but such women do effund abundance of Waters. Some
are of opinion, that the larger quantity of Waters, does accompany weakly, and
those female Children: but the lesser, strong, and male Children. I have often
seen waters burst forth in the midst of the going with Child without Abortion,
the Child remaining safe, and strong even to the birth. As therefore there are
naturally but two Waters only, (whereof the one is contained in the Chorion,
and the other in the Amnion) so it may sometimes fall out, beside the ordinary
course of nature, that several Waters may be accumulated in membranes proper to
themselves, or else in the reduplications of the Chorion.

As for the Membranes or Coats of the Womb, Of the Membranes.
since their proper use and office chiefly is, to contein the Waters; and those
Waters appear to be two only; it is most certain that the membranes themselves
are not (necessary and usually) more then two.

But as for those who reckon three, I conceive they were deluded, because the
Ancients call the self-same membrane sometimes Chorion, from the conflux of
Veins; and sometimes Allantoides, from its figure.

Every conception is covered over with these two membranes; as also every
Brain has a double Meninx: every Tree and Shrub a twofold Bark; every Seed
and Fruit a twofold Covering: whereof the Exterior is the harder, and tighter.

The more Interior of the two forementioned membranes (containing the
Colliquamentum, or purer humor) is the thinnest, and is called Amnion, that
is, Amiculum, the little covering, because it covers and involveth the foetus.
The Exterior (which is by much the larger, and stronger membrane) is called
Chorion, because (says Fabricius) many Veins, and Arteries are assembled in
it, tanquam in Choro, as in a Quire. And hence the Coat of the Eye, and
likewise that contexture of Veins and Arteries which is found in the Ventricles
of the Brain, are both called (...), from the resemblance they have with these
veins in the Chorion.

This Membrane Chorion does fill all the Womb; containing a stiff, troubled
humor; and to its exterior part, the Vterine Cake or Caruncles adhering, do
fasten the Conception to the Womb.

The Interior part of this Membrane (in a Woman) is almost conjoined to the
Amnion, nor is it easily separated from it. In those Animals which cleave the
hoof it is exceeding large, and contains a hundredfold more moisture in it,
then the Amnion. For the Amnion at the beginning, is scarce so large as a
Nutmeg, or fair Bean, and is commonly found in one Horn of the womb only,
namely in that where the Foetus inhabiteth.

The Coat Chorion is (chiefly in Women) rough, and viscous without; but within
smooth, and glibbe, and interwoven with abundance of Veins. The upper part of
it is (in Women) thicker, and softer, but the lower part, thinner and more
membranous.

In women the After-burden grows to the upper part of this membrane: But in
Sheep, several Caruncles are fastened to several parts of it. In Hinds, and
Does, the conception does cling to the Vterus at five places only: but in a
Mare it does adhere to the Vterus in an infinite company of places. And
therefore Fabricius says, that the cap. 3.
Afterbirth is in almost all Viviparous creatures, a soft flesh, lax, porous,
thick, and something black, growing about the terminations of the Vmbilical
vessels, which he resembles to a looser Parenchyma or affusion of a Liver or
Spleen; which is therefore by Galen called Caro adenosa, a glandulous 5. apho.
45.
flesh; and we now commonly call it Hepar Vterinum, the Uterine Liver; into
which the extremities of the Vmbilical vessels are disseminated, which do
derive nutriment from the womb to the foetus.

But now, this fleshy Substance neither is in all Animals, nor at all times in
those in whom it is: but in those Animals only in whom the conception does
firmly cleave to the womb, and then only, when it is fastened to the womb to
bring down sustenance to the foetus. For in the beginning, the conception (like
an egg seated in the womb) is contiguous to all the circum-jacent parts of the
Uterus, but does on no side grow thereunto; but does produce its foetus (as it
is in an Egg which is sat upon by the Hen) out of the Humors contained in
it: but that adhaesion and cleaving to the womb, is then first of all procured,
and also this fleshy body is then first beginning to be generated (which fleshy
substance is the Tie of the Conception to the womb) when the foetus is now
perfectly formed, and standing in need of other, and more plentiful supply of
Aliment, does dispatch the Extremities of the Umbilical vessels to the Uterus,
as Emissaries or Agents, that may from thence (as the Roots to Plants) convey
provisions. For in the beginning, (as we have showed) when the Punctum saliens,
and the Blood do only appear, the Propagations of the Vmbilical vessels are
only disseminated through the Colliquamentum, and the Coat Amnion. But when
once the fabric of the Body is set up, those Propagations do conduct
themselves farther, and being grown more numerous, are divaricated in the
Chorion also, that so they may transport sustenance from thence to the foetus,
out of the whitish humor which resideth there.

By which it appears, that the foetus of Viviparous Animals is at the
beginning fed in the same manner, as the Chicken is sustained in the egg; and
does for that cause abide in the Vterus, that at length (when it has no longer
a supply from its own stock) it may, by the mediation of the caruncles grow to
the Vterus; and be more plentifully supported, by the contribution of its
Parent.

Wherefore Fabricius did rightly observe, that the conception was in some
Animals scarce fastened to the Vterus at all. And therefore Sowes, and Mares,
have none of this carnous connection; but their egg or conception, as it is
first of all constituted out of the moisture or juices which do flow in the
Vterus, (as the Egg in the Hen is enlarged by the White, without any tie to
the Vterus) so does it also receive Augmentation; and the foetus also, having
Aliment administered to him from the conception, (wherein he is contained) is in
the same manner supported, as the egg out of the liquors. Whence a notable
argument does result, that the Foetus of those Animals is no more nourished by
the Mothers blood, then the Chicken in the egg: and that the Humor
comprehended in the Chorion, is neither Urine, nor any other Excrement, but the
Aliment of the Foetus. Although (as we have observed before) when the alible
juice is exhausted, the remainder thereof does degenerate into an Excrement,
like to the Urine. And this also is evident, from that which we have formerly
noted, concerning the Cotyledones; namely, that the fleshy substance is in
those Animals of a spongy substance, and does (like a Honycomb) consist of
innumerable acetabula, holes or orifices, which are all of them full of a
mucous white matter; (which Galen also records to be anciently observed) and
that thence the Extremities of the Vmbilical vessels do suck Nutriment, which
they transport to the foetus; as the small branches of the Mesenterical veins
do, in those Animals which are already born, derive chyle out of the coats of
the Guts, through which they are diffused.

I therefore apprehend the employment of the Vterine cake and the caruncles, to
be such as is commonly imputed to the Liver and the Breasts. For the Liver does
add a preparation to the chyle which is attracted from the Guts, fitting the
same for the sustenance of the Body; and likewise the Vterine cake does afresh
concoct the alible nutriment which proceeds from the Parent, to support the
foetus. The Breasts also (being composed of a glandulous substance) do strut
with milk; and though they are parts which (in some Animals) do not appear at
all, yet at the time of pregnation they are seen to be full, and tumorous: so
the Vterine cake, being a laxe or flaggy and fungous substance, both flow with
a whitish sap, and is never found but at the time of Ingravidation. The Liver,
I say, is the nutritive instrument of the Body wherein it is; the Breasts of
the Infant, and the Placenta of the Embryo. And as the mother does by her own
food acquire more milk then she has use for to sustain her flesh, and blood,
which milk is reconcocted in her breasts, and treasured up; so also such
Females as are great with young (in whose womb this Placenta is) do prepare,
and suppeditate to their foetus an aliment which is defecated by those
caruncles: by which it comes to pass, that an impure or laudible diet is
administered to the Embryo's, according as the Parents diet it self is either
wholesome or impure, and according to the sufficient or imperfect concoction,
which they afford it in those organs of the Vterus. For some Embryo's have a
more perfect organ provided for them, such as is that carnous substance of the
Uterus, which is wanting in some. In some likewise this Vterine cake is
thicker, larger, and fuller of Blood; but in others it is more spongy and
paler: like those two Sweet-breads, or glandulous bodies called Thymus, and
Pancreas. For you shall find as much difference of these in Animals, as of the
Breasts, or of the Bowels: for to instance only in Livers, they are in some
ruddy and sanguine; in others, (as in the greatest part of Fishes, and likewise
Cachectical persons) pale. Mares do feed upon the crude grass, and do not chew
the cud; Sowes swill themselves with any filth, and both these want a Vterine
cake, which is the organ of completing the Aliment.

And therefore true is that of Fabricius; saying, cap. 3.
This fleshy substance is, in several kinds of Animals, different in Magnitude,
Figure, Site, and Number. Women have one only; as Mice, Conies, Ginny-pigs,
Bitches, Cats, and several Animals, whose feet are distinguished into toes, and
have teeth in both jaws: but all Animals which cleave the hoof, and have teeth
in one jaw only, whether they be domestics, as the Sheep, the Cow, and the
Goat; or wild, as the Hind, the Do, the Roe, and the like, have diverse.
Again, those Animals which have but one, in them it either resembles a Cake
(and thence comes its denomination) as in Women, Conies, the Hare, and the
Mole, Mice, and Ginney-pigs: or else it resembles a zone or girdle, or swath
ingirting the trunck of the body, as in Bitches, Cats, Ferrets, and the like.
In some it is like a chalice, or Acorn cup, comprehending the greater part of
the foetus (as in the Hare and the Cony:) where the convexe part grows to the
Vterus, and the concavous respects the foetus. Likewise in those females which
have but one, and that resembling a Cake, though the figure be alike in them
all, yet the situation is unlike. For in a woman it grows to the bottom of
the womb, and is distant a great way, that is by the length of long vessels
from the foetus: but in Mice, Ginny-pigs, and Conies, it is annexed partly to
the Region of the Loins, partly to the sides of the breast. But those animals
which have more of these carnous substances then one, they are all of them
furnished with teeth in one jaw only, as Sheep, Cowes, Hinds, Roe-deer, and
the like, and yet in these also there is a diversity. For Ewes have more
caruncles, and those of different magnitude; the biggest whereof are as large
as a Nutmeg; the least, as a Cich-pease, or Vetch: which are also of a round
figure, and ruddy complexion, and their unequal parts do respect the Uterus,
appearing like soft Warts, or Nipples. But Cowes have greater, flatter, and
paler, which are of a spongy consistence, like Mush-rooms: and these seem to
take their original from the Chorion. Hindes and Does have five only; and
those bred out of the womb, do protuberate toward the conception, and there
exhibit their Cavities. But being firmly fastened to the Uterus, are not easily
separated from it; except it be when the birth is drawing nigh; at which time
(like ripe fruits) they do very easily forego their former connection. And being
torn off from the womb, I have observed the greater part of the Blood which
flows afterward, to issue, not from the Conception, but from the Uterus it
self.

Fabricius treating of the Union of this Carnous substance with the Vterus,
does labor by many (but weak) arguments to prove, that the Vmbilical vessels,
do join to the extremities of the vessels of the Womb by several insertions:
and De form. foet. page 122.
this he does undertake, chiefly, to countenance the old opinion received
almost by all: for he confesses that he can deliver nothing certain touching
this matter, because the Carnous substance hinders a man from discovering the
truth thereof. But yet neither sense, nor reason do evince, that there are any
more Anastomoses in the Vterus, then in the Liver, between the branches of the
Gate, and Hollow-vein; or in the Breasts, between the veins which convey blood,
and those that waft the Milk. There is indeed, in some places a kind of
contiguity or juxtaposition of those vessels, and sometimes an insertion of the
one into the Coat of the other; but no where any such coalition, or Union, as
Fabricius conceiteth. For were it so, the veins ought to be inserted into the
Arteries: for the vessels, which do convey blood into the Vterus and Caruncles
are Arteries: but they which transport it from the Vterus to the Foetus, are
Veins, as is apparent to all men; because they waft the blood from the
Afterbirth into the Hollow-vein.

Wherefore the Opinion of Arantius seems to me to be more true; namly that the
Orifices of the Umbilical vessels are not united to the Orifices of the Vessels
of the womb. For there are fewer Vessels conducting blood to the womb, then
veins returning it to the foetus: and the greatest part of the propagations of
these are terminated in the Chorion. And yet Fabricius, either overswayed by
his respects to Antiquity, or his envy to Arantius, does stubborny persist in
the patronage of the old opinion.

As concerning the Cotelydones, or Acetabula, cap. 4. De Acetabulis.
Fabricius concludes nothing certain: but only compileth the several opinions
of Antiquity. But we have before, in the History of Hinds and Does, showed in
what Animals these Acetabula are; where we have withal signified, that they are
certain little Cells of small capacity, dispersed through the Caruncles or
fleshy substance, and fraught with a white, or gellyish substance: as the
Honeycomb is full of Honey.

In Hinds, they do fitly resemble the shape of that cavity in the Haunch-bone
which receives the Bone of the Thigh; and therefore they are by the Greeks
called Cotyledones: and in Latin, Acetabula, because they resemble those little
Vessels or Sawsers, which were anciently brought to the table with Vinegar for
sauce. These cavities do not exceed in magnitude the perforations of a large
sponge, and into each of them, so many slender sprigs of the Umbilical Vessels
do deeply insinuate themselves; because in them is laid up the sustenance of
the foetus, and not blood (as Fabricius conceived) but a gelly resembling the
thicker white of an egg. Whereby it appears (as we have formerly declared)
that the foetus of such as cleave the hoof (as likewise all other) are not
sustained by the mothers blood.

That which Aristotle delivers concerning the Hist. an. l. 7. c. 8.
Acetabula, that they are diminished as the Foetus does improve: is contrary to
experience; for the larger the foetus, the larger the caruncles also, and their
Acetabula, or cavities, are more capacious, and more numerous, and more full of
an albugineous juice.

If you compress these caruncles, no blood at all does issue out; but as water,
or honey does distill out of a squeezed Sponge, or Honeycomb. So in like
manner if you press the Acetabula, an albugineous liquor does drop out; and
when that liquor is pressed out, the Acetabula are more contract, pale, and
flaggy: and at last do resemble the Nipples of the Breasts, or large falling
Warts.

Aristotle indeed does truly affirm, that these Acetabula are not in all
Animals; for they are not in Women, nor in any else (as far as I know) who have
only one carnous substance in their Vterus. But as for their office and use: I
conceive that all the Caruncles (like Breasts) do not contein blood, but digest
a sap, like to the White of an Egg, which they do administer to nourish the
foetus.

The description of the Vmbilical Vessels, is Of the Navel.
elegantly delivered by Fabricius, as his Tables or Pictures of them are very
artificial. cap. 2.


The Veins, says he, passing from the Uterus toward the Foetus, are ever
united, and improved: nor does their conjunction give over, until two large
Trunks do result out of them all; which penetrating the Navel of the Infant,
they do constitute one only large Trunk; which is inserted into the Liver of
the Infant, and perforated into the Hollow and Gatevein. In like manner, the
Arteries adjoined to these Veins, which are very numerous, and small, passing
on from the Womb to the Foetus, and at last uniting their forces together, and
so enlarging, do conspire into two large Trunks also; which after they have
passed the Navel, do separate themselves and break company from the Veins, and
sticking to the sides of the Bladder of Urine, by the help of an intervening
Membrane; they do here and there disperse themselves into the branches of the
great Artery descending into the Thighs. But we must take notice that this
description given by Fabricius, does agree only to the Navel of an Infant, and
is not common to the foetus of every Animal at large: Nor yet to an Infant
neither, but after it is fully formed; for the Arteries (at the beginning,) are
inconspicuous, as being so slender, that we have need of the quick sight of a
Lynceus to discern them: nor do they indeed reveal themselves afterward, but
only by their pulsation: for in other things they are no way distinguishable
from Veins. Because therefore (as I have showed elsewhere) the slender branches
or filaments of the Arteries have no pulsation, (at lest so far as we can
discover) they cannot be known from Veins: for they are at that time so thin
and subtle, that they are woven to the coats of the veins like the finest
threads: or rather do obscurly insinuate themselves into the tunicles of the
veins: whereby they are utterly indiscernable. But all the veins (by a
retrograde production) uniting their sprigs at last, do all conspire into one
Trunk, (as all the branches into one stock) as also the Meseraick Veins are all
concluded in the Venae Portae.

Near the Embryo, they are divided into two Trunks; but when once they enter
into him, they do constitute one only Navel, which does terminate in the
Hollow-vein, near the right deaf-eare of the Heart; and passing through the
Liver, is inserted into the Gate-vein, and does scatter no more Propagations,
until by a very large Orifice it displayeth it self out of the gibbous part of
the liver. So that if you open the Trunk of the Hollow-vein from the deaf-ear
of the Heart, downwards, and so exhaust it of all its blood, you may perceive
three Orifices as conjoined together; one whereof is the entrance into the
descending Trunk of the Hollow vein, the other is the going out of the Branch
of the Liver disseminated through all its gibbous part; but the third is the
Original of this Umbilical vein. Whereby it clearly appears, that the
original of the veins is not to be sought for in the Liver: because the Orifice
of the descending Trunk of the Hollow-vein is much larger then the
Liver-branch; for the Umbilical branch is as large as that. But the Branches
are never said to be the Original of their Trunk, but rather where the Trunk is
largest, there are we to repute the Original of the branches toreside: now
that happens at the entrance of the right ventricle of the Heart; and
therefore that ventricle is to be accounted the original, and promptuary of all
the veins.

I return now to the Umbilical vessels, which are not divided after the same
manner in all Animals; for there are found in some 2. or more little Branches in
the body of the foetus; whereof some pass into the Liver, others into the Vena
Portae, or Meseraical veins. But in a human foetus, the Trunks of the veins and
arteries being involved together, are complicated, some 3. or 4. Fingers
breadth from the Navel (as if one should twist so many wax candles together
like a cord) being skinned over, and conglutinated by the help of a thick and
gellyish memmembrane. This little cord passing on to the Chorion, is in the flat
part of the Afterbirth, and interior superficies of the Chorion distributed
into several Propagations; and thence is ramified into many other almost
infinite little Branches; by which the Aliment attracted as it were by so many
roots, is derived to the foetus. The Veins relating to this little Cord, are
distinguished in sundry places by little knobbs, or warts, as it were by little
bladders full of blood, that so the blood might not rush in too forcibly upon
the foetus. By the number of these protuberations, the superstitious Midwives
do spend their divination concerning the number of children yet to come; and in
case they find none of these knobs, they pronounce the Woman barren for the
future; and likewise by the distance between these protuberations, they fondly
prophecy of the space between child and child; and also of the
discrimination of the Sex, from the variety of their complexion.

Also the constitution of the Umbilical vessels is like to this, in almost all
other foetuses which have but one only Uterine cake; namely, in Bitches, Mice,
and others: but the little cord is in them shorter, and less complicated. But in
Cows, Ews, Hindes, Does, Sowes, and other Animals, whose foetus is not
sustained by aliment derived from one carnous substance, or cake, but from
diverse, the distribution of the Umbilical vessels is also diverse: For the
little branches, or terminations of the vessels are not disseminated through the
cake only, but also (and that chiefly too) without it, through the coat called
Chorion, dispatching their most slender fibers thither likewise: just as the
distribution of the Umbilical vessels (namely without the little cord) appears
in a humane foetus, before the conception is fastened to the Uterus. Whereby it
appears, that the Embryo does not derive all his Aliment from the cake; but
part thereof, and that the chiefest, from the humor contained in the Chorion.

As touching the uses of the Vmbilical vessels, I do not consent with
Fabricius: for he is of opinion that all the blood is derived to the foetus
from the Vterus by the veins; and the vital spirits from the mother by the
Arteries. He also denies, that any part of the foetus in the womb does execute
any public function: but affirms, that each particular part takes care
only for it self, how it may be nourished, augmented, and preserved. And
also, because he finds no Nerve amongst the Umbilical Vessels, he concludes
the foetus to be void of all Sense and Motion: Implying, that the Mothers Womb,
or the Uterine Cake, is as it were the Heart, and Original from whence all
things spring to the foetus, and from whence the Influent heat is divided
amongst all the parts. All which are manifest mistakes. For the Humane Embryc,
when he is not yet four months standing in the Womb (and some sooner)
exercises an opparent motion, volutation, and calcitration: especially if he
be prejudiced by extremity of cold or heat, or any other outward inconvenience.
Likewise the Punctum saliens it self, (before the Heart is erected) does stir
by an apparent pulsation, and also distribute blood, and spirits: and being (as
we have observed) reduced to a dying and langiuishing condition by cold, is by
the fresh accession of heat, kindled anew, and revived. And also in the
Caesarean birth, it is very evident, that the Embryo's life does not
immediately proceed from the Parent, nor the Spirits result from her: for we
have often seen Infants, which have been cut out of their Mothers Womb, survive
their Parent for several hours: and have also known a Cony and a Hare which did
live, though they were born by incision made upon the Uterus of their Parents.
Moreover, it is a sure way to know whether the Infant that sticks in the
birth be alive, or not, by the pulsation of the Vmbilical Arteries. But most
certain it is, that those Arteries are not moved by the virtue or operation of
the Mothers, but of his own proper Heart: For they keep a distinct time and
pawze, from the Mothers pulse: which is easily experimented, if you lay one
hand upon the Mothers wrest, and the other on the Infants Navel-string. Nay in
a Casarean Section, when the Embryo's have been yet involved in the membrane
called Chorion, I have oftentimes found (even when the Mother was extinct, and
stiff almost with cold) the Vmbilical Arteries beating, and the Foetus himself
lusty. Wherefore it is not true, that the Spirits do proceed to the foetus from
the Mothers Arteries: nor is that more true; namely, that the Vmbilical Vessels
of the foetus are conjoined by Anastomosis, to the Vessels of the Vterus. For
the Foetus enjoys his own proper life, and is furnished with beating
Arteries, which are full of Blood, and Spirits long before the conception (in
which he is formed, and walloweth) does cleave to the Vterus: just as it is
with Chicken in the Egg.

As for the use of the Arteries in the foetus (as also in grown bodies) we have
in our Treatise of the Circulation of the blood, demonstrated it to be much
different from what has been formerly received: all which is also confirmed
from hence.

The Secundines; they also are an undeniable part of the Conception, and do
depend upon the Foetus, assuming life and their vegetal faculty from him. For
as in the Mesentery, the blood is derived to the Guts, by the branches of the
Coeliacal, and Mesenterical Arteries; and that very Blood being circulated by
the Veins, does convey the chyle together with it unto the Liver, and the
Heart: so in like manner, the Vmbilical Arteries do derive blood to the
Secundines, which blood the Veins do reduce to the Foetus, together with alible
juice. And therefore those Arteries do not immediately proceed from the Heart
as principal Vessels; but (as instruments of inferior rank and quality) do
arise out of the Crural branches.

There came forth a Book of late, wrote by Adrianus Spigelius, entitled De
formato Foetu, of the formed foetus: wherein he treats concerning the Use of
the Umbilical Arteries; and does demonstrate by powerful arguments, that the
Foetus does not receive its Vital Spirits by the Arteries from the Mother: and
has fully answered those arguments which are alleged to the contrary. But he
might also as well have proved by the same Arguments, that the Blood neither is
transported into the foetus from the Mothers Veins by the Propagations of the
Umbilical Veins: which is chiefly made manifest by the examples drawn from the
Hen-egge, and the Caesarean Birth.

For did the Heat and Life flow to the blood from the Mother; she being
extinct, the Infant would instantly dye also; (for he must needs be a thing
concluded in the same fatality) nay before her: for when death approaches, the
subordinate parts do first languish, and grow cold, before the principal; and
hereupon the Heart declines the last of all. The Blood, I say, of the Foetus
himself, should grow chill first, and disproportionate to its Office, as being
derived from the Uterus; seeing that the Vterus it self, is deprived and
destitute of all vital heat, before the Heart.

Of the Conception.
FAbricius has indeed recounted many miraculous things, concerning the Birth,
but we meet with more things worthy our wonder concerning the Conception. It
is indeed a dark, obscure business; however we shall adventure to propose
something in a problematical way, in such sort that it shall appear we do not
only go about to subvert other men's opinions, but also to disclose our own.
And yet whatsoever falls from me concerning this subject, I desire may not be
so taken, as if I conceived them pronounced by an Oracle; but that liberty
which I freely allow all other men, I do of right challenge to my self; that
so I may offer those things as true, which seem probable in such dark matters,
until such time as they can be convinced of falsity or error.

This employment does chiefly relate to the Uterus, without whose preparations
and functions, you may in vain expect a Conception. And because it is
certain, that the Geniture of the Male does not so much as reach to the cavity
of the Uterus, much less abide there for any time; that geniture does derive
foecundity to the Uterus only by a kind of contagion, (not as if it were now
tangent, and operating, but because it has formerly touched.) The Woman or
Female does seem after the spermatical, contact (in coition) to be affected in
the same manner, and to be rendered prolifical, by no sensible corporeal Agent,
as the Iron touched by the Loadstone, is presently endowed with the virtue of
the Loadstone, and does draw other iron-bodies unto it. Namely, having once
received that virtue, which we have spoken of, it does exercise the plastic
generative power, and procreateth its own like, no otherwise then plants do,
which we see are empowered with the force of both Sexes.

But I cannot but wonder, where that faculty, (when the act of coition is
finished, before the production of the Egg or Conception does reside? and to
what that active virtue of the Male is imparted? namely, whether to the Uterus
alone, or to the whole Female? or rather, primarily to the Uterus, but
secondarily to the Female? or lastly, whether, as we see with our eyes, and
think with our brains, so a female does conceive with her Vterus?

For though the female sometimes (conceiving after coition) does not produce a
Foetus: yet we know that those Symptoms did ensue, which gave a clear
testimony of a conception set on foot, (though it came to nothing.) Your little
Bitches which are kept too plentifully, and thereupon admit coition (without
success) are notwithstanding observed to be sluggish about the just time
whereat they ought to puppy, and bark as if they were in distress, and likewise
filtch away the young whelps from another Bitch, and lick them over and cherish
them, (as tenderly as if they were their own natural productions) and fight
eagerly to keep them from the true Parent. Nay some of them have milk, or
beestings (as they call it) in their teats; and are obnoxious to the distempers
incident to those that have really puppied; just as Hens will cluck in their
season, though they have no eggs at all to sit upon. Some kind of birds (as
namely Pigeons) if they admit coition at the wonted time, though they lay no
eggs at all, or subventaneous ones only, yet are possessed with their usual
sedulity and providence of building nests.

For the virtue proceeding from the Male, does so largely fructify the whole
Female, that it produces a thorough change and alteration, as well in the
frame of their minds, as in the constitution of their bodies. And though this
do principally happen to the Vterus fitted for the impression; and from thence
the power and efficacy thereof be derived to the whole body; (as from the
turgent testicles of the Male, there is an accession of strength superadded to
the whole body) yet the same scruple remains: namely, how this power
communicated to the Vterus it self, does inhere in it? as whether in the whole
Vterus, or in any one part of it only? For there is nothing to be found
abiding therein after coition: for the geniture of the Male does either
suddenly fall out again, or vanish away, and the blood does circulate again
from the uterus, by the vessels.

Besides, what preparation or maturity of the Vterus is it, that does require
the genitall seed; or from whence does it proceed? for unless the uterus be
prepared for coition, all other attempts are frustrate; nay several animals do
not admit coition it self, without they be thus prepared. That maturity, I
confess, does sooner befall them, by reason of their converse with the Male,
and the incitements which he uses to provoke them; yet it is procured (as that
ripeness of fruits in plants) by natures own inclination and tendency. But
what this Alteration is, I shall now deliver, according as I have found it by
experience.

First of all the uterus appears thicker and more fleshy: and afterward
(forasmuch as concerns the interior superficies, which is the place where
the future conception is to be received) it grows more tender, answering in
lubricity and softness to the internal ventricles of the Brain, as we have
even now affirmed concerning Hindes, and other creatures which cleave the
hoof. But in Bitches, Cats, and other multiparous Animals, whose feet are
distinguished into toes, the horns of the Womb do exactly resemble the little
smooth trumpets of a woman's womb, or the appendixes of the guts of Birds, or
the Ureters in Men: and in some places have little knobs which do swell inward,
and become exceeding soft, through which, after coition (as we have observed in
Hinds and Does) as if they did open themselves, the first albugineous humors
do transpire into the capacity of the Uterus, out of which humors the
Conception or Egg is formed. And this is the manner how the Uterus is by the
Coition of the Male (like Fruit by the Summer heat) impregnated, and heightened
into the highest pitch of maturity.

But because there are no manifest signs of Conception visible, before the
Uterus does begin to open, and the albugineous liquor, or slender threads,
(like the Spiders web) and the first rudiments of the future Egg or Conception
appear: and seeing the substance of the Uterus, now ready for Conception, does
so nearly resemble the Constitution of the Brain: why may we not imagine, that
both their functions are also alike; and that something like, if not the self
same thing that the phantasme, or appetite is to the brain, is excited in the
Uterus: from which the generation or procreation of the Egg does succeed? for
both their functions are equally called conceptions, and both are Immaterial;
though they be the principles of all the actions of the body: namely this, of
the Natural, that of the Animal actions: this the first cause and principle of
all actions relating to the generation of Animals, and that of all actions
tending to their preservation. And as Appetite does spring from the conception
of the brain, and that conception from the outward appetible or desirable
objects: So also from the Male (as being the more perfect Animal) as from the
most natural appetible object, the natural conception dotharise in the Uterus,
as the Animal conception in the Brain.

And from this Appetite or Conception it comes to pass, that the female does
produce an offspring like the male Genitor. For as we, from the Conception of
the Form, or Idea, in the Brain, do fashion a form like to it in our works, so
does the Idea or Species of the Genitor, residing in the Uterus, by the help of
the formative faculty, beget a Foetus like the Genitor himself; namely by
implanting that Immaterial species which it has, upon its Workmanship. In like
manner as Art, which is the (...), or Species of the future work, does produce
a Like in its operation, and generate it in the matter: As the Builder erects a
House, according to his pre-received conception. And the same thing happens
in other productions, and artificial generations. So that what discipline does
effect in the Brain, namely Art, that in proportion does the Coition of the
Male effect in the Uterus, namely the plastical Art: whereby several foetuses
are procreated either like or unlike, by the same Coition. For if the
Generations, and first artificial conceptions (which are only imitations of
the natural) are thus produced by the Brain; how much more probable is it,
that the Exemplars of Animal Generation and conception, are in like manner
produced by the Uterus.

And because Nature (all whose works are admirable and divine) does institute
such an Organ (namely the Brain) by whose sensitive faculty and virtue, the
conceptions of the rational soul do exist; namely Desires, and Arts, and the
Principles and Causes of so many several productions, whereof man (by the
motive faculty of the Brain) is the Author by Imitation; why shall we not
think, that the same Nature, which has contrived the Womb, which is a no less
admirable Organ then the Brain, and has framed it of a like constitution to
execute the office of Conception, has designed it also to a like function, or
at least to one which bears an Analogy with it: and that Nature did intend an
Organ which is every way like the Brain, to an employment, like to that to
which the Brain is assigned? For since a skilful Artificer, does accomplish
his Workmanship, by his ingenious proportioning one Instrument to one thing,
and the same to the same, and the like to the like: So that by the materials
and shape of his Instruments, a man may easily judge of their use and actions;
no less then Aristotle has instructed us, to know the nature of Natural
Bodies, by Analyt. l. 2. c. 35.
their conformation, and the Fabric of their Parts; and the Art of
Physiognomy, does by lineaments and parts of the face (as the Eye, Nose,
Forehead, etc.) give judgment of the manners and dispositions of Men: What
shall hinder us, out of the same fabric of parts, to pass our conjecture that
their Office is also the same?

But such is the preposterous success of things, that when we come to debate
customary and familiar things, their frequency does diminish their greatness,
and admiration which is due unto them; but when matters of less consequence
(but such as are more unusual) do present themselves, we instantly magnify
them because of their novelty and rarity. Whosoever shall weigh with himself,
how the brain of the Artist, or the Artist himself by virtue of his brain, does
form things which are not present with him, but such as he only has formerly
seen, so much to the life: and how little birds which immure themselves all
winter long, do exactly chant, and recall to mind those Ditties, the next
Spring, which they had learned the Summer before, though they did never
practice them all the while; and which is yet more strange, how a little bird
will most artificially contrive a Nest (whereof she never saw any platform
before) and that not from her memory, or any habit implanted in her, but only
by mere fancy: and how a young Spider, without any pattern, or brain, by the
help of fancy only, does dispose her web; whosoever, I say, does diligently
ponder these things, will, I conceive, not think it an absurd or monstrous
matter, for a woman to become the efficient cause of Generation, being
impregnated by the conception of a general, immateriall Idea.

I know full well, that some scoffing persons will laugh at these conjectures;
approving nothing but their own private inventions. Yet this is the wont of
Philosophers, when they cannot clearly discover how things themselves are
brought about, to conceive some way consonant to the course of nature, and the
next borderer upon truth her self, how such matters may be achieved. And,
indeed, all those Opinions (which we now cry up) were at first mere figments,
and imaginations; until they wrought a solid credit in us, by sensible
experiment, and were ratified by their necessary known causes. Aristotle
says, That Philosophers are in some sort lovers of Fables, because a Fable
does consist of Metaph. l. 1. c. 2.
strange things. And, indeed, those who were first possessed with the
admiration of things, did advance Philosophy. And for my own particular, since
I plainly see that nothing at all does remain in the Uterus after coition,
whereunto I might ascribe the principle of generation; no more then remains in
the brain after sensation, and experience, whereunto the principle of Art may
be reduced; but finding the constitution to be alike in both, I have invented
this Fable. Let the Learned and ingenious stock of men consider of it; let the
supercilious reject it: and for the scoffing ticklish generation, let them
laugh their swinge.

Because, I say, there is no Sensible thing to be found in the Uterus, after
coition; and yet there is a necessity, that something should be there, which
may render the female fruitful; and that (in probability) can be no corporeal
essence; we have no refuge left us, but to fly to mere Conception, and
reception of Species without any matter; namely, to apprehend, that the same
thing is effected in the womb, as in the Brain: unless some cunning
Philosopher, whom the Gods have better provided for, can find out some
efficient cause, which is not concluded in our recapitulation.

Some Philosophers, even of our own time, have furbushed over the old opinion
concerning the Atoms: and do therefore conceive, that this Contagion (as also
all other) does proceed from the most subtle effluviums, or emanations of the
masculine seed, which do easily transpire after the manner of Odours, and so
are shot into the Uterus at the time of coition. Some again raise up certain
incorporeal spirits, like so many Agents, Angels, or Demons. Others understand
a Contagion, like to a kind of ferment, or sower levening. Others fancy, and
imagine otherwise. Allow therefore, amongst others, some place for this
conjecture of mine, until there be some certainty established in the business.

I have observed many things, which will easily extirpate the recited opinions
of other men: (so that now it is much more obvious to say what it is not, then
what it is) but those Observations relate not to this place, but must be
proposed elsewhere. At the present I shall say this only: If that which we
commonly call Contagion, as being derived from the spermatical contact in
coition, and remaining behind in the female, (when the Geniture it self is
not then in presence) is the efficient and operatour of the future procreation:
if, I say, this Contagion (whether it be Atoms, or Odor, or Ferment, or
whatsoever else) be free from the nature of a body, it must of necessity be an
incorporeal thing. And if moreover, upon enquiry it do appear, to be neither a
Spirit, nor a Demon, nor a Soul, nor any part of a Soul, nor yet something
which has a Soul (as I conceive I can demonstrate by several arguments, and
experiments.) What remains, since I can imagine nothing else, nor no man has
hitherto dreamed of any other thing, but freely to profess my self to be at a
stand? But He that doubts and admires, says Aristotle, does confess Ibid.
he does not know. Wherefore, if to avoid the stain of Ignorance, ingenuous Men
turn Philosophers, it is clear, that they pursue Knowledge, for Knowledge
sake, and not for any other use.

We ought not therefore to be condemned, if being desirous of knowing things,
and upon that account walking in untrodden paths, we set before you something,
which, at first blush, may seem fabulous, and fictitious. For as all things are
not to be swallowed with too much credulity; so those things which have been
exactly and long considered, are not utterly to be despised, though they do
not appear so rare to sharp-witted men.

Aristotle himself wrote a Book de Mirabilibus Metaph l. an. ^.
Auditis, of Hearsay Wonders. And in another place he says, That we must
not only pay thanks to them, to whose Opinions a man may safely subscribe;
but to those also who have spoken but superficially to the purpose. For even
they also are of some use, for they exercise our habits. For had not Timotheus
been, we had lost a great deal of Music: And yet if Phrynis had not been,
Timotheus had not been existent neither. In like manner they who have delivered
any kind of truth; for we have received some Opinions from some Philosophers,
and yet some others were the occasion of these Philosophers.

And therefore being moved by the example and authority of so Gallant a person
as Aristotle, least I might seem made up of nothing but the subversion of other
men's Doctrines; I have chosen rather to propose a feigned Opinion, then none at
all: and have contented my self in this place to play the Phrynis to Timotheus;
viz. to shake off the sloth and drowziness of the Age we live in, and to
awaken the wits of Industrious heads, permitting rather that abler men should
sport themselves with my proposals, then that any careful Enquirer into the
nature of Things should accuse me of sluggishness.

Truth is, a man cannot search after a more august Theorem, nor learn any thing
of more use, then this; namely, How all things are produced by an Univocal
Agent? or after what manner the same thing does still generate the same? and
that not only in the productions of Art, (for so a House erects a House, one
Face limnes another, and one Image forms another Image) but in those also
which relate to the Mind: as a Mind begets a Mind; and one Opinion another
Opinion. Democritus his Atoms, and Eudoxus his Chiefest Good placed in
Pleasure, did impregnate Epicurus: Empedocles his Four Elements, Aristotle:
the Doctrine of ancient Thebes, Pythagoras and Plato: and Geometry, Euclid.
Just in this manner is the Son borne like the Father; and the Virtues which do
innoble a Family, and the Hereditary Vices also, are sometimes after many
Generations transported to Posterity: some Diseases also produce their like in
other subjects; as the Leprosy, the Gout, Syphilis, or French Pox, and so
forth. But what talk I of Diseases, since Succession Arist. hist. an. l. 7. c.
6. and, de genesis an. l. 1. c. 17 l. 7. c. 11.
has at a vast remove, repeated the very Moles, Warts, and Scarres, which the
Greatgrand-sires formerly wore? The mark of the Family (says Pliny) is
repeated in the arms of the Daci, every fourth Birth. That Mind, Opinion, and
those very Manners, which are now out of use, may many years hence (when all
those are decryed, which are now received) return again. For the Eternal
mind of the Divine Creator; which is imprinted in Things, does create the
Image of it self in Humane Conceptions.

Having therefore overcome some difficulties which relate to this Subject, I
have a strong desire to discourse the Matter more closely: that what I have
hitherto delivered cursorily, may seem to carry a fairer probability at least
with it, and also to excite the Wits of Studious men, to make a deeper search
into the business.

Therefore (that we may illustrate the thing the better) let A stand for the
fruitful egg (namely the matter of the fruitful chicken) which is alterable
and convertible into a chicken, or is a chicken in posse: and let B stand for
that which fructifieth the egg, distinguishing it from a subventaneous egg:
namely, the efficient cause of the chicken, or that which does alter the Egg,
and convert or terminate it into a chicken. And C for the chicken it self, or
final cause, for whose sake both the Egg, and that which fructifieth the Egg
do exist: namely, the act, or reason of the chicken.

Now we take it for granted (which Aristotle does demonstrate) that every first
Mover or Alterer is together with that thing which is moved or altered by it.
Now those things are most properly said to be simul, together, which are
generated at the same time: so that movens and mobile the thing altering, and
the thing altered are actually together, and in case one of them be, the other
must needs be also; for of necessity if the effect be in being, the cause
thereof must also be.

Whenever therefore A (namely the fruitful Egg, is actually in Being; B
likewise (namely the internal mover, and efficient, or fructifier) is actually
in being also. But whenever B is actually existent, C also, (at least in some
sort) namely the Species of the chicken, or the form without matter is
existent. For B is the internal efficient of the chicken; that is to say, that
thing which does move, or alter) A, (namely the Egg) into C, namely the Reason
of the chicken. That therefore every moving thing, may be together with the
thing that is moved; and every cause with the thing caused, it is necessary
that C, should exist together with B, because the Final cause, as well in
Nature, as Art, is the first of all the causes; for it moves, and is it self
not moved: But the efficient moves, because it is incited by the final cause.
For there is in every efficient, in some sort, ratio finis, the reason of the
End or final cause; by which final cause, the efficient, operating with
providence, is moved.

Aristotle's Authority is clearly on our side. de part. an. l. 1. c. 1.
That seems, says he, to be chiefest amongst Natural causes, which we
signify under this notion, Cujus Gratia, for whose sake: For that is the
reason; but the reason is the first cause as well in Natural, as Artificial
effects. For when the Physician does define Health, and the Mason a House, by
either the Intellect, or by Sense, he uses to render the reasons and causes of
the thing which he does effect, and also subjoineth the reason why he makes
it so: though that cause which is the cause for whose sake, which is the cause,
and reason of the good and fair, is rather conjoined to the works of Nature,
then of Art.

But the End, says he, is the thing for whose Phys. l 2. tract. 3.
sake: as the thing for whose sake we walk, is Health. For if you ask, why a
man does walk, we reply, to continue his Health: and having made that answer,
we conceive we have rendered the cause thereof. And therefore whatsoever is
interposed, some other thing moving thereunto, is done for the Ends sake: as
Extenuation is procured for Health sake, or Purgation, or Physic, or any other
instruments, for all those are for the Ends sake. And a while after. But we
ought always to seek out the first cause of every thing: as in other matters.
As a man builds because he is a Builder: but he is a Builder by reason of his
Art of building: this therefore is the first cause: and so it is in all things
whatsoever. And hereupon he affirms, that, that cause which does first move,
and in which the Reason and de genesis an. l. 2. c. 1.
form does lie, is a worthier, and more divine cause, then the material.

In every Natural Generation of Animals therefore, both the matter out of
which, and the efficient by which (namely A, the thing moved, and B, the thing
moving) are both for the sake of the Animal already begotten, or which is to be
begotten: because that which moves, and is not moved it self, namely C, is
alike in them both. For both they (namely A, and B,) are both movable, and
moved; namely the thing fructifying, which is B, (which does both move and is
moved,) and that thing which is fructified, which is A, namely the Matter or
Egg, which is only moved or altered. Wherefore if no moveable thing be
actually moved, unless the thing moving be together present with it.
Certainly, neither shall the Matter be moved, nor the Efficient move or effect
any thing, unless the first mover be in some sort present too: viz. the form,
or species which is without Matter, and is the principal cause. For the
Efficient and Generant (according de genesis an. l. 2. c. 4.
to Aristotle) as they are such, do belong to that which is effected, and
generated. And therefore it is a syllogism framed out of the first and
necessary causes: namely,

Whenever B is actually existent, C also is actually existent: (namely,
moving in some sort) Whenever A is actually existent, B is also actually
existent. Therefore, whenever A is actually existent, C also is actually
existent.
Indeed Natural, and Artificial Generation are after one and the same manner.
For both are instituted for the sake of something, and do alike out of a kind
of providence direct themselves to a proposed End: for both are first moved by
some conceived form, which is immaterial, and is produced by Conception. For
the Brain is the Organ of Arist. de part. an. l. 1. c. 6.
the Conception of the one, (for Art is the Reason of the Work) (devoyd of all
Matter) in the Soul, whose Organ the Brain is) but the Uterus, or Egg of the
Other.

The Conception therefore of the Egg, or Uterus, is (in some sort) like the
Conception of the Brain it self, and both of them do alike partake of the
End. For the Species, or Form of the Chicken is in the Uterus, or Egg,
without any matter at all: as the reason of the Work is in the Artificer, and
the Reason of the House, in the Brain of the Builder.

But because, (...) inesse, this word, to be in, is perhaps an Equivocal word,
and things may be said to be Simul, together, several ways; therefore we
say, and affirm, that the Species and Immateriall Form of the future Chicken
is Aliquo modo, in some sort, the cause of the pregnation, and fecundity of the
Uterus: because, after coition, there is no corporeal thing found therein.

But how this Immateriall cause, as the principle, can be alike in the Brain,
and in the Vterus, and how they agree among themselves, or do differ, namely
the Conceptions of the Brain, and of the Vterus, or Art, and Nature; and in
what manner, that which fructifieth (namely, the internal Efficient cause of
the procreation of an Animal) is in the Male, and its Geniture; in the Female
and her Womb; in the Egg also, or mixed Workmanship of both; and what the
difference between them is: hereafter, when we shall treat Universally of the
Generation of all Animals (even of those also, which are generated by
Metamorphosis; namely, of Insects, and Spontaneous Productions, in whose Eggs,
or first Rudiments, there is a plain Species or Immateriall form, as being
the moving principle in regard of those things which are to be produced, as
also in all other Seed whatsoever) and also when we shall discourse of the
Soul, and its affections; and also how Arts, Memory, and Experience, are only
the Conceptions of the Brain, we shall endeavor both largely, and
perspicuously to explain.
