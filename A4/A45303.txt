A MODEST OFFER OF Some meet CONSIDERATIONS TENDERED TO THE LEARNED PROLOCVTOR,
AND To the rest of the Assembly of DIVINES, Met at Westminster.

BY A TRUE LOVER OF TRUTH AND PEACE.

Imprinted, M.DC.XLIV.

A Modest Offer of some meet Considerations, Tendered to the Learned
Prolocutor, and to the rest of the Assembly of Divines met at Westminster.
LEarned and Reverend Brethren; If you be now (as is supposed) upon the advice
of a Form of Church Government; I beseech you, in the fear of God, setting
aside all prejudice, to take into your sad thoughts these considerations
following.

It is (I perceive) an usual Prayer of many Preachers well affected to your
Assembly, that God would now (after 1600 years universal practice of the
whole Church of Christ, upon earth) show you the pattern in the mount; as if,
after so long and perfect inquisitions, there could be any new discoveries of
the form that was, or should be; wherein, I suppose their well-meaning is not
a little injurious both to the known truth, and to you: for, what revelations
can we expect thus late? or what monuments of either Scripture, or history can
now be hoped to be brought to light, which your eyes have not seen, and former
ages have not inquired into? Surely, ye well know, there can be but these three
forms of Church Government, possibly devised; Either by Bishops, or by
Presbyteries, or by the multitude of several and select congregations: Every of
which, have both their abettors, and their adversaries; The first has all
times, and places, since the days of the blessed Apostles, till this age, to
stand for it; The second has the late persecuted, reformed Church of France,
(which never desired, nor meant to make their necessitated form, a pattern
for others) the Netherlands, and Scotland, for precedents of it; The third has
the Ministers of New England, and their Associates, commonly styled by the name
of INDEPENDENTS, vehemently contending for it: The adversaries of every of
these are as well known, as their friends; and the pleas, which every of them
makes for it self, are as well known as either.

I suppose it is yet res integra; else, I should lay my finger upon my lips;
Both the Houses of Parliament, your Assembly, and the whole Kingdom, stand yet
free, and unengaged to any part: For the National Covenant (as it is
interpreted by some of your selves, and those other Divines whose allowed
Sermons have commented upon it) intends not to abjure, and disclaim
Episcopacie, as such; but only bends against the whole present fabric of
Government, as it is built on these Arches, these Pedestalls; so as if it be
taken asunder from those (some of them, not necessary) appendances, you are no
way forstalled in your judgment against it; nor any other, that has lift up
his hand in this solemn Covenant.

That I may not urge the Latin Translation of the same Covenant, printed and
sent abroad to the Low Countries and France, and other Churches, which ran
only upon tyrannicum regimen Episcoporum; that only the Tyrannical
Government of the Prelates, not their fatherly and brotherly preeminence, is
there abjured.

Your wisdoms know well how to distinguish betwixt a Calling, and the abuses
of the execution thereof; betwixt the maine substance of a Calling, and the
circumstantiall and separable appurtenances thereunto; from which it may be
divested, and yet stand entire.

I should be a flatterer of the times past (which is not often seen) if I
should take upon me to justify, or approve of all the carriages of some that
have been entrusted with the Keys of Ecclesiastical Government; or to blanch
over the Corruptions of Consistoriall Officers; in both these, there was fault
enough, to ground both a complaint, and Reformation; and, may that man never
prosper, that desires not an happy Reformation of what ever has been, or is
amiss in the Church of God; But this I offer to your serious consideration,
whether Episcopacie, stripped of all circumstances that may be justly excepted
against, and reduced to the Primitive estate, may not be thought a form, both
better in it self, and more fit for this Kingdom and Church, then either of
the other.

How ancient it is, I need not appeal to any but your selves, who do well
know, that there was never yet any History of the Church, wherein there was not
full mention made of Bishops, as the only Governors thereof; neither can any
learned adversary deny, that they have continued, with the general allowance
of Gods Church, from the very Apostolic times, until this present age. And
whether it can be safe, and, lie not open to much scandal, to exchange so
ancient an institution hitherto perpetuated to the Church, for a new, where no
necessity inforces us, judge ye.

How universal it is, being the only received government of all the Christian
Churches over the face of the whole earth, (excepting only this small spot of
our neighborhood) ye know as well, as the undoubted relation of the
Christianographie can tell you: and how unsafe it may be, to depart from the
form of all the Churches, that profess the name of Christ, (who do all
submit themselves to Bishops, or Superintendents, except the fore-excepted) I
leave to your grave judgment.

Besides, how Episcopacie is, and has long been settled in this Kingdom, and
(as it were) incorporated into it; and enwoven into the municipall Laws of this
Land, so as that it cannot be utterly removed, without much alteration in the
whole body of our Laws; is a matter well worthy of not the least consideration.

But, all these would yet seem light upon the Balance, if there were not an
intrinsecall worth in the institution it self, that might sway with you: The
Covenant binds to the endeavor of such a Government, as is according to the
Word of God, and the example of the best Reformed Churches. And now, let me
appeal to your own hearts, and the hearts of all judicious and unprejudicate
Readers, whether the rules of Church Government, laid forth in the Epistles to
Timothy and Titus, do not suppose, and import that very proper jurisdiction,
which is claimed by Episcopacie at this day: Which, if it were not intended to
be left as a perfect pattern to succession; the whole Church of Christ should
have been left in the dark, without any direction for the succeeding
administration thereof: Those charges are plainly given, not to many, but to
one; and do most manifestly imply not a parity, but preeminence and power.

And if the example of the best Churches must carry it: What Church could be
more pure, and more fit for our imitation, then the Primitive? and that part of
it which immediately followed the Apostles of our blessed Savior Jesus Christ?
And do not you full well know, that our Histories, and unquestionable Authors
name the men, whom those Apostles, by imposition of hands, ordained to this
function? Do not Ignatius, Irenaeus, Tertullian, Polycrates, Egesippus,
Clemens, Eusebius, Jerome instance in those persons, who succeeded each other
in those first Sees? If you tell me of the difference betwixt the Episcopacie
of those first Ages of the Church, and that of the present times; I do
willingly yield it, but, withal, I must add, that it is not in any thing
essential to the calling, but in matters outward, and merely adventitious; the
abatement whereof (if it shall be found needful) diminishes nothing from the
substance of that holy institution; What can be more express, then, in the
ancientest of them, the blessed Martyr, Ignatius, the mention of the three
distinct degrees of Bishops, Presbyters, Deacons; encharged with their several
duties which were yet never intermitted, and let fall to this present day; How
frequently, and vehemently does he in his genuine Epistles (twice in that to
the Ephesians) call for due subjection to the Bishop and the Presbytery? How
distinctly does he in his Epistle to the Magnesians, name their Bishop, Dama;
and their Presbyters, Bassus, Apollonius, Stephanus? How does he in his Epistle
Ad Trallianos set forth the Bishop (...), and the Presbytery, (...), etc. And
if any man shall be so unjustly scrupulous, as to call into question the credit
of this gracious Author, (reserved, no doubt, by a special providence, for the
conviction of the schisms of these last times) therein out-doing Vedelius
himself, (who stoutly asserteth some of these Epistles, whiles he rejects
others as suppositious) let him cast his eyes upon the no less famous, and
holy Martyr, and Bishop, Polycarpus; who (as Irenaeus, Iren. advers. Haeres. l.
3. c. 3.
an unquestionable Author tells us, one, whose eyes beheld that Saint) did not
only converse with those that had seen Christ, but also was by the Apostles
constituted in Asia, Bishop of the Church of Smyrna. Let him, if he can, deny
Cyprian the holy Martyr and Bishop of Carthage, writing familiarly to the
Presbyters, and Deacons there; sometimes gravely reproving them; sometimes
fatherly admonishing them of their duties; in diverse of his Epistles. Let him
deny, that his contemporanye Cornelius, Bishop of Rome, acknowledges 46.
Presbyters committed by the Catholic Church, to his charge: Shortly, let him,
if he stick at this truth, deny that there was any Christian Church of old, any
History.

All which duly considered, I would feign know what reason can be showed, why
that ancient, yea first government by the Bishop and his Presbytery, received,
and with all good approbation and success, used in the Primitive Church, and
derived (though not without some faulty omissions, and intertextures, which may
easily be remedied) until this present day, should not rather take place; then
a government lately, and occasionally raised up in the Church, for the
necessity, or convenience of some special places, and persons; without any
intention of an universal rule and prescription.

If you shall say that this Government by Bishops has been found, by sad
experience, hitherto, a block in the way of perfect Reformation, destructive to
the power of Godliness, and pure Administration of the Ordinances of Christ;
give me leave to answer; That, first, I fear, the Independent part, will be
apt to say no less of the Presbyterian; boldly pressing their defects, both in
constitution, and practice; and publicly averring, the exquisitely-reformed
way to lie betwixt the Episcopal, and Calvinian, which they have had the
happiness to light upon; neither want there, those, who, upon challenge of
further illumination, tax those Semi-separists, as coming far too short of
that perfection of Reformation, which themselves have attained.

Secondly, I must, in the fear of God, beseech you here to make use of that
necessary distinction, betwixt Callings, and Persons; for it oftentimes falls
out, that the Calling unjustly suffers for that, whereof only the Person is
guilty; Let the Calling be never so holy, and the rules of Administration never
so wise, and perfect; yet if the person, in whose trust they are, be either
negligent, or corrupt, or impotent in ordering his passions and carriage, it
cannot be but all things must go amiss, and much disorder and confusion must
needs follow to the Church of God; and if such has been the case in some late
times, why should the blame be laid upon the Calling, which both is innocent,
and might have been better improved? Give me a Bishop (such there have been,
and such there are, let D. Potter the late Bishop of Carlisle, for instance, be
one) that is truly conscionable, pious, painful, zealous in promoting the
glory of God, ready to encourage all faithful Preachers, and to censure and
correct the lazy, and scandalous; careful of the due imposition of his hands;
meek and unblameable in all his carriage; and now tell me how the government of
such an one (regulated by the holy and wholesome Laws of our Church) can be
said to be obstructive to the success of the Gospel, or to destroy the power
of Godliness? certainly, if all be not such, the fault is in the Men; their
Calling does not only admit of, but incites them to all virtue and goodness;
whereof if they be defective, let the Person take off the blame from the
Function.

Neither doubt I to affirm, that it may well be made good, that the perfectest
Reformation, which the Church of God can be capable of, here upon earth, may
consist with Episcopacie, so regulated, as it may be, if it please the High
Court of Parliament to pitch upon that course: And indeed how can it be
conceived, that the careful inspection of one constant, prudent, and vigilant
overseer, super-added to a grave and judicious Presbytery, should be any
hindrance to the progress of godliness? especially, when he is so limited by
the bounds of good laws and constitutions, that he cannot run out, without the
danger of a just censure; There are already many excellent rules of Government,
if they were awaked, and actuated by full authority; and, where there is any
deficiency, more might be easily added to make the body of Church-lawes
complete.

To give a taste of what may be effected, with very little or no alteration of
one Form of Government to another.

I remember one of our Brethren of Scotland, in a Discourse tending to the
advancing of the Presbyterian way, tells us, that Dr. Montague, the late worthy
Bishop of Winchester, asked King James of blessed memory, (whose sweet
affability the world well knew) How it came about, that there were so few
heresies, and errors of doctrine, broached, and prosecuted, to the public
disturbance of the Church of Scotland? Unto which, the wise and learned King is
said to have returned this Answer; That every Parish has their Pastor, ever
present with them, and watching over them; That the Pastor has his Elders and
Deacons, sorted with him; That he with them, once a week, meets at a set time
and place, for the censure of manners, or what ever disorder falls out in the
Parish; so as he, by this means, perfectly knows his flock; and every
aberration of them, either in matter of opinion, or practice: And, lest any
Error, or Heresy may seize upon the Pastor; they have their Presbyteries,
consisting of several Shrivalties, which meet together in the chief Town or
City next to them, every week also once; and have there their exercise of
Prophesying; after which, the Moderator of the said Meeting asks and gathers
the judgments of all the said Pastors, concerning the doctrine then delivered,
or, of any other doubtful point, that is then and there propounded; And if the
said Presbyters be divided in their opinions, then the Question is, under an
enjoined silence, put over to the next Synod, which is held twice a year;
unto that all the Pastors of that Quarter, or Province duly resort; accompanied
with their Elders; The Moderator of the former Synod begins the Action; then a
new Moderator is chosen for the present, or (as it seldom falls out) the last
Moderator, by Voices, continued.

Any Question of doubt being proposed, is either decided by that meeting, or
(if it cannot be so done) is, with charge of silence, reserved till the
National Synod, or General Assembly; which they hold every year once;
Whither come not the Pastors only, but the King himself, or his
Commissioners; and some of all Orders and Degrees, sufficiently authorized for
the determining of any Controversy, that shall arise amongst them. Thus he.
And certainly this bears the face of a very fair and laudable course, and
such, as deserves the approbation of all the wel-willers to that discipline:
But let me add, that we either have, or may have, (in this very same state of
things, with some small variation) in effect, the same Government with us;
only there wants some care and life in their execution, which might, without
much difficulty, be redressed; Every parish has, or by Law ought to have their
Minister ever present with them; and carefully watching over them. In stead
then of their Pastor, Elders, and Deacons; we have in every Parish, the
Minister, whether a Rector, or Vicar; Churchwardens, Questmen, or Sidemen, and
Overseers for the Poor; and in places of any eminence, a Curate or Assistent
to the Rector, who is a Deacon at least; These may, and ought, and, in some
places, do duly meet together, every week, on a set day, in their Vestry; and
decide such differences as happen amongst them; and may well be enjoined, to
take notice of such abuses and mis-demeanours, as are incident into their
parish, for their speedy reformation, within the Verge of their own power.

In stead of their Presbyteries, consisting of several pastors, we have our
number, and combination of ministers, in the divisions of our several
Deanries; under which, are ranged all the Ministers within that circuit; Over
whom the Rural Deane (as he is called) is every year chosen, by the said
Ministers of that division, as their moderator, for the year ensuing; whose
office (if it were carefully looked unto, and reduced to the original
institution) might be of singular use to Gods Church; This Deanery, or
Presbytery, consisting of several pastors, may be enjoined to meet together
every month, or oftener (if it seem fit) in some city or town next unto them;
and may there have their exercise of prophesying, as I have known it practiced
in some parts of this kingdom; and as it is earnestly wished and recommended,
by that excellently-Learned Lord, Verulame, late Lord Chancelour of England, in
his prudent Considerations: and then, and there, may endeavor to decide any
doubt, that may arise in their several parishes; either concerning the
doctrine of their Minister, or scruple in cases of conscience, and may transact
any public business that may concern their whole division; But if any such
matter or question should arise, as their divided opinions cannot fully
determine; it may (under charge of silence) be put over to a more public
meeting; which is the synodall assembly of the Clergy held twice a year, under
the moderation (hitherto) of the Archdeacon; And if there the question fail,
of a full determination, it is, or may be referred, (with like silence and
peace) to a Diocesan Synod, which may be held every year once; under the
presidency of the Bishop; And if yet the decision come not home, it may be
referred to the determining of a Provincial Synod, or yet higher, to a
National: So as in these cases of doubts, or errors, if men would not be
wanting to themselves, nothing needs to be wanting in the state we now stand
in, to the safety, and happiness of our Church.

For matter of Ordination of Ministers; the former Constitutions of our Church,
have deeply enjoined the presence, and assistance of those, who by their
original institution, are the Presbytery of the Bishop, at, and, in, the
examination, and allowance of the persons to be ordained; requiring also, the
joynt-imposition of those hands, which attested the sufficiency of the said
Examinates; not without a severe sanction of two years suspension, of the act
of Ordaining, to pass upon any Bishop, or Suffragane, that shall be found
failing in any of the particulars; The qualification of those that are to be
ordained, is in our Canons already set forth, with much caution; for their age,
their degrees, their abilities, the testimony of their holy conversation;
neither need I doubt to affirm, that he, who (besides all other circumstances
of education) is able to give a good account of his faith in Latin, according
to the received Articles of the Church of England, and to confirm the same by
sufficient testimonies, out of the holy Scripture, may be thought competently
fit, (for matter of knowledge) to enter upon the first step of Deaconship;
which the wisdom of the Church has (according to the Apostles rule) appointed
(not without a sufficient distance of time) in way of probation, to the higher
order of Ministry; forbidding to give both orders at once; and requiring, that
he, who is ordained Deacon, shall continue a whole year, at least, in that
station, except, upon some weighty reasons, it shall seem fit to the Bishop,
to contract the time limited: And, lest there should be any subreption in this
sacred business, it is Ordered, that these Ordinations should be no other then
solemn, both in respect of time and place; neither ought they to be, nor in
some places are, without a public preconization of lawful warning affixed
upon the Cathedral Church door, where the said Ordination shall be
celebrated; and over and besides the charge, that none shall be admitted to be
a Candidate of holy Orders, but he who brings sufficient testimonials of his
good life and conversation, under the seal of some College in Cambridge or
Oxford, or of three, or four grave Ministers, together with the subscription
and testimony of other credible persons, who have known his life and
behavior, by the space of three years next before; it is well known to you,
that before the Act of Ordination there is public Proclamation made to the
whole Assembly, that if any man knows any crime or impediment in any of the
persons presented, for which he ought not to be ordained, that he should come
forth and declare it before any hand be laid upon his head, for his full
admission.

Notwithstanding all which care of our dear Mother the Church of England; if
it shall be thought meet, that any further act of Trial, shall pass upon
those, which are suitors for Ordination, how easily may it be ordered, that at
the monthly (or, if need be, more frequent) meeting of the Ministers, within
the same Presbytery, or Deanrie; they may be appointed to make trial of their
gifts, and undergo such further examination of their abilities, as shall be
thought requisite, ere they shall be presented, and admitted by the Bishop, and
his Presbytery to that holy function.

And whereas it is much stood upon, that it is meet the people, (whose souls
must have right in him, to whose trust they are committed) should have some
hand in their consent to that Pastor, by whom they must be fed; it must be
said, that besides their devolution of their right to the patron, who, as their
trustee, presents a Minister for them, it may be no prejudice at all to the
power which by Law and inheritance is settled upon the patron, that the person
whom his choice pitches upon, be appointed before hand to preach, (for a
trial) to that congregation to which he is so designed, and if either for his
voice, or other just exceptions he be found unmeet for them, that another, more
fit may be recommended by the said Patron to the place; but if through faction,
or self-will, or partiality, the multitude shall prove pe^vish, and
fastidious, they may, in such a case, be overruled by just authority.

As for matter of censures, it may not be denied, that there has been great
abuse in the managing of them, both upon Ecclesiastical persons, and others:
suspension of Ministers upon slight, and insufficient causes; both ab officio,
and beneficio, has been too rife in some places of later times; and the
dreadful sentence of Excommunication has too frequently, and familiarly
passed upon light and trivial matters: How happy were it, if a speedy course
may be taken, for the prevention of this evil; In the conference at
Hampton Court, a motion was strongly made to this purpose, but without effect;
if the wisdom of the present Parliament shall settle some other way for the
curbing of contumatious offenses against Church Authority, it will be an act
worthy of their care and justice. In the mean time, as for this, and all other
Ecclesiastical proceedings, it may with much facility, and willing consent of
all parts, be ordered, that the Bishop shall not take upon him, to inflict
either this, or any other important censure, without the concurrence of his
Presbitery; which shall be a means (in all likelihood) to prevent any
inconvenience that may arise from the wonted way of Judicature.

As for the co-assession of a Lay-presbyterie, in swaying these affairs of
Church Government; Ye well know how new it is; some of you might have been
acquainted with the man that brought it first into any part of this Island; and
what ground there is for it, either in Scripture, or antiquity, I appeal to
your judgment: Surely, the late learned Author of the Counsel for the
reforming the Church of England, (although otherwise a vehement assertor of the
French Discipline) ingenuously confesses, that however those Protestants which
live under Popish Governors, have done wisely, in deputing some choice men,
selected out of their congregations, whom they call Elders, to share with their
pastors, in the care and management of Ecclesiastical affairs; Yet, those
Protestant Churches which live under the government of Protestant Princes, may
with the safety of those respects, which mutually intercede betwixt Pastors and
people, forbear any such deputation: for as much, as the supreme Magistrate,
transfers (for the most part) to himself, that, which is the wonted charge of
those deputed Elders; concluding, that those men, do merely lose their labor,
who so busily endeavor on the one side, to disprove the antiquity of the
Lay-Eldership; and, on the other, by weak proofs to maintain, (clean
contrary to the mind of the Apostle) that the text of Saint Paul (1 Timothy
5.17.) is to be understood of Pastors, and Lay Elders; Thus he; with what fair
probability, I leave to your judgment.

Neither is it any intention of mine to meddle with any piece of that
government, which obtains in other the Churches of God; but only, to
contribute my poor opinion, concerning the now-to-be-setled affairs of our own.

What shall I need to suggest unto you the dangerous under-workings of other
Sects? secretly indevouring to spring their hidden mines to the overthrow both
of the one government, and the other; whereof, without speedy remedy, perhaps
it will be too late to complain; no doubt, the wisdom, and authority of that
great Senate (whom ye also serve to advise) will forthwith interpose it self to
the prevention of those mischiefs, which the variety of these heresies, and
sects (though some of them cloaked with the fairest pretenses) threaten to this
poor Church: It is no boot for me to tell you, that the less disunion there is,
the more ground of safety; and that where the holy purposes of Reformation may
be effected, with the least change, there must needs be the most hope of
accordance.

The rest to the wise application of the powerful and judicious; It is enough
for me to have thus boldly shot my bolt amongst you; and to have thus freely
discovered my honest, and well meant thoughts to so able judgments; What I want
in my poor indevours shall be supplied with my prayers, that God would be
pleased to compose all our miserable distractions, and to put an happy issue,
to the long and perilous agitations of this woefully tottering and bleeding
Church and Kingdom; Which the good God of heaven vouchsafe to grant for his
great mercies sake, and for the sake of the dear Son of his love Jesus
Christ, the Just. Amen.
