A further Account of the Victory obtained by the English and Dutch Fleet, over
the French; Received by Express this Morning from Admiral RVSSEL. Published by
Authority.
Whitehall, May 26. 1692.
BY a Letter from Admiral Russel dated the 24th Instant, when he was at Anchor
before la Hogue, we have this Account, That the Admiral having the day before
sent Vice Admiral Rooke, with a Squadron of Ships and Fireships, and all the
Boats in the Fleet to burn the Ships, which were there penned up; it succeeded
so well, that six were burnt that Night, and six more the next Morning: Of
these, six were three Deck-Ships, and the other six from Sixty to Seventy Guns;
and one Ship of Fifty Six Guns was overset and utterly lost, so that the whole
number in that Bay was destroyed. The Men in the Boats behaved themselves so
bravely, that they took Possession of several of the Enemies Ships, and beat
the French with their own Guns from their Platforms.

The Fleet is now so disposed upon the Coast of France, That if there be any
more French Ships thereabouts, we may hope to have a good Account of them.
