SELECT OBSERVATIONS ON English Bodies OF Eminent Persons in desperate
DISEASES. First written in Latin by Mr. John Hall, Physician: After Englished
by JAMES COOK, Author of the Marrow of Surgery. To which is now added, an
hundred like Counsels and Advices, for several Honorable Persons: By the same
Author. In the Close is added, Directions for drinking of the Bath-Water, and
Ars Cosmetica, or Beautifying Art: By H. Stubbs, Physician at Warwick.

LONDON, Printed by J. D. for Benjamin Shirley, under the Dial of St. Dunstan's
Church in Fleet Street, 1679.

TO THE Right Honorable, FULK, Lord Brook, Baron BROOK OF Beauchamp-Court.
Right Honorable,
THE great and undeserved Favors for many years conferred on me by your noble
Ancestors, with those which I still receive from your self, and oher their
Survivors, encourage me to present to your Lordship this Piece, now called to
be made public a second time; humbly begging your acceptance and protection of
what I tender in acknowledgment of my Duty and Service. The Part formerly
printed, and what is added thereto, are most fit to be laid at your Honor's
Feet, having received allowance from your Honorable Family to be made public,
and most of it practiced among them, for the special use of those Noble
Persons, who are now gone from us; and for whose memory I could not transcribe
with dry eyes. What their Loss was to the Public, is well known, and no less
lamented; and so great to me, that I can never forget it.

The Right Honorable, your Father, was pleased to show me greater Favor than
I do pretend to deserve. Your Right Honorable Mother was seldom ill at home or
abroad, without commanding my attendance: The same have the Right Honorable
your Brothers and your Lordship done. By whom scarce any thing was taken
without my thoughts, from the most eminent Physicians, till they became
acquainted with their Bodies. In all which Services it pleased God, I so
ordered my self, that I have had from your Physicians, not only thanks but
commendation. Which I have always looked on as proceeding more from the Favor
of your Honor's Family, than my Deserts.

These Obligations under which I lie, have given your Lordship the trouble of
this Dedication, and this poor Piece, which I here present with my hearty and
humble Prayers for all and each of your Honorable Family, that they may
receive the greatest of God's Favors here, and the full enjoyment of Himself
in Bliss hereafter: Which is and shall be the continued Petitions of,

Warwick, March 25. 1679. My Lord, Your Honor's most humble Servant in all
Duty, JAMES COOK, Sen.

THE PREFACE TO THE READER.
Courteous Readers,
TO you it is that I now address my self, to give you some small account of
what is added in this Impression. To the Select Observations on English Bodies,
you have an hundred Counsels and Advices, by very eminent Physicians, on
several Honorable Persons, and others of no inferior Rank and Repute in this
and other Counties. The Honorable Family which I have attended, and do still,
has always commanded me, as to receive all Prescriptions, so to see them made
up in several places where I have attended, both to see them taken, and to
observe their Success. Their favorable allowance I have for what is done.
Their Honors, when Physicians were with them, were always ready to engage them
to be helpful to their sick Neighbors; the Advices for such being for most
part entrusted in my hands. I hope what is made public can be no wrong to any
of those Physicians, having for their Pains, Prescriptions, and Directions,
received generous Pay and noble Entertainment. If there necessarily occur any
thing concerning those living, I humbly beg their Pardon, and if I had not
feared giving offense, I had named them as well as those dead: But this is not
all, for as I have a due rememembrance of those deceased, (whose freeness I
always found in communicating to me what they kept private from most) so I give
hearty thanks to those living, who have been like minded, and by whose
Directions I have received no small advantage. Something there is intermixed,
and something also in the Close, of Dr. Stubbs's, whose Civilities and Openness
I cannot but remember. He was not a Person greedy of Gain. Not many months
before he died, he said to me, We must study all ways possible to find out and
appoint Medicines of cheap rate, and effectual; for Money is scarce, and
Country People poor: To which I answered, That it had been, and should be my
constant Course as long as I lived. I have heard it was said by one, over whom
none is supreme in these Nations, (whom God preserve and continue here, and
crown with Himself in Glory hereafter) That if Dr. Stubbs had but some of
Saturn to poize his Mercurial Brain, he would make a good Statesman. And not a
few famous Practitioners have said the like of him, as a Physician. But he is
gone, and I cannot but say, Seldom comes a better. But to pass this, I hope my
Service in this Impression will be civilly accepted, which is all, save to
crave leave to subscribe my self always a Friend to the Friendly, and an Enemy
to none of Mankind.

OBSERVE. I.
THE Countess of Northampton, aged 44. on March the 6th, 1622. as she was
walking in her Bedchamber, suddenly fell into a swoon, without either sense or
motion for half an hour; she fell with her face on the frame of a Table, which
caused a Wound with contusion, whence arose Inflammation, as also a great and
troublesome Flux of Rheum, which distilling from her eyes, excoriated the whole
face with exulcerations; the habit of her Body was Scorbutic and Cacochymick:
her residence then was at Ludlow-Castle: To whom being called, I cured
perfectly, by God's assistance, with the following Medicines. She was purged
with the following, Sena j. Agarick iij. Rubarb ii. Cinnamon iss. Infuse them
all for twelve hours in three pints of White Wind on warm embers, after it was
strained through an Ippocras bag, six or seven times, and sweetened with half a
pound of Sugar. Dose v. twice a day, viz. in the morning fasting, and at four a
clock in the afternoon. This gave five or six stools a day without gripings, it
was continued four days. Her face was anointed with white Ointment camphorated,
which cured it in four days. The Body being not sufficiently emptied, the
following Pills were used, Pil. Ruffin. and Succin. Crato. of each equal parts;
of i, were made seven Pills, three of which she took when she went to bed, the
next day she had six or seven stools. But this was observable, that instead of
swallowing the Pills, she chewed them, and so let them down, saying she could
not swallow them, though never so little; withal, that she thought it the best
way. She took of these twice a week. Those days she took not the Pills, I
administered the following: Elect. Chalyb, Crat. mixed with the salts of
Scurvy Grass, Wormwood and Coral. In her Broth was boiled these Scorbutic
Herbs, viz. Scurvy Grass, Watercresses, and Brook-lime. After all, she took
this Scorbutic Beer, Scurvy Grass M iv. Watercresses, Brook-lime, each M ii.
Wormwood, Fumitory, and Germander, each M. j. Roots of Fennel, Borage, Succory,
each i. Root of Elicampany ss. Liquoris i. Flowers of Borag* Buglosse,
Rosemary, each p ii. Boil them all in five gallons of Beer, till one be wasted.
After having the following Ingredients in a bag, viz. Sarsaparilla, Calamus
aromaticus, Cinnamon, Mace, Seeds of Anis and Fennel, each ss. Juniper Berries
viii. Let them be infused in the hot liquor, well covered till it be cold,
after put it up, hanging the bag in it. After fifteen days she drank of it,
using no other; this she drank in April. Till it was ready, she took the
following; Sarsaparila ii. Guaicum i. Sassafras roots ii. Slice and bruise
them, after infuse them in lbxv. of Spring Water for twelve hours. After add
Scurvy Grass M ij. Brook-lime, Watercresses, each M i. Betony, Agrimony, each

he was cured Jan. 1. 1634. Being sent for to him, I found him grievously
afflicted with the Scurvy; on the right side he had a Tumor without
discoloration, so that I judged there was a Tumor of the Liver. He was grown as
lean as a Skeleton, was Melancholy* with black and crusty Ulcers appearing in
the Legs. He had a loathing of Meat, a disposition to Vomit, and an Erratic
Fever; his Urine was red, as in a burning Fever, yet without thirst or desire
to drink. The Pulse was small, weak, and unequal, scarcely to be perceived with
the Finger; all Signs of a confirmed Scurvy. His Parents were very earnest with

require some time, and it would be difficult. I proceeded as follows: Crystal.
Vener. ii. Spec. Diatrion. Santal. i. Pull. Holland. a ii. M. f. Pull. for four
doses. It gave him every day three or four stools without any gripings. The
affected Part was anointed with Unguent. Fido variol. To the Ulcers was used

Scurvy Grass, etc. as before. He purged with Pil. Ammoniac. River. Of ss. was
made three Pills, one of which he took every third day, which gave him two or
three stools. The Side swelled and pained, was anointed with the following:
Unguent. Splanch. Magistr. Dialth. a^ i. M. morning and night. In the use of
the Scorbutic Beer all other was forbidden. After the use of the former Pills
twice, there fell out a painful Tumor of the Foot, which hindered his Sleep by
night, and moving by day; with which were joined Faintings. Therefore to
corroborate was used the following: Pull. Pannon. rub. i. Magist. Coral. ss.

being well, there fell out a miserable Pain in the right Shoulder, which he was
freed from in twenty four hours, by the use of Vng. Fido. He never left off the
Steeled Wine, except those days he purged. After meals he took of the next so
much as would lie upon a shilling: Plerisar. ss. Sacch. ii. Misc. Especially he
purged twice with Pil. River. And sometimes he took in a morning two of the

no Profit, yea rather all was more bitter and grievous. She could scarce
swallow or breath, she felt something hard in her Throat to the bigness of a
Dove's Egg, so that she could scarce swallow either Meat or Drink. This was
caused from Wind; for she felt it move, and in its motion it was sometimes more
and less painful. The tumor of the Almonds was not great, from a Rheum which
distilled from the Head, which vexed her most in the night. Her Illness and
Pain hindered her Sleep, and she feared she should be choked; yet her Head was
afflicted with a notable numness, and an incredible proneness to sleep; her
Body was so also afflicted, by which she could scarce walk, and natural Action
was deprived; hence there were a long time of Symptoms. By intervals her Hands
would be livid, not without coldness; the Thighs tumified, and a Scorbutic
Dropsy broke forth; all these being caused from the Spleen, Liver, and

Urine was red and little. It was then called the New Fever, it invaded many, I
was called the third day of its Invasion. The Stomach being stuffed and
burdened with ill humors, as I perceived, I advised the following Vomit:
Emetick Infusion ix. This gave twelve Vomits without any great trouble. The day
before she had (unknown to me) drunk much Milk to quench her thirst, by reason
whereof the Vomit at first drew forth a wonderful quantity of curdled Milk, so
that she was almost choked, after came Choler mixed with Phlegm, afterward
burnt Melancholy. She had also six Stools Phlegmy, mixed with green Choler and
much Serosities. Her vomiting ending in three hours, I gave a Pill of Laudan.
Paracelsi gr. vii. (sure he mistook her, for four is a good Dose) after which
she slept four hours, the Pain of her Head ceasing. Then to me unknown her
Servant gave her a draught of Whey, which being drunk, she presently had three
Vomits of black Stuff without any trouble, and two such like Stools, and was
cruelly afflicted with the Hiccough, to allay which I gave Claret wine burnt
with Aromatic, which succeeded; she was quieter the rest of the Night, but did
not sleep well. In the morning I gave Chicken-broth, made with appropriate
Herbs, and so for four hours she rested. At the end of that time I gave a
draught of the Decoction of Hartshorn hot. On Monday morning having some
evacuation, I appointed the same Decoct, should be given cold. She was

that she could not drink without great diffiiculty, for which she used the
following Gargarism: Diamoron. simp. iv. Honey of Roses ii. Rosewater lbj. Oil

Decoction, the seventh day, the Pox appeared, yet the foresaid Gargarism was
used for the Throat, and she drunk of the Decoction of Hartshorn cold four
times a day, and so she was cured. I ordered that the Pox after the eighth day
should be anointed with this: common Oil, and Carduus water, well shaked

than lbss of the ordinary Decoction. It is safe in the Spleen, Picrocholis, and
Jaundice confirmed; cures the Dropsy, Apoplexy, French Pox, and other grievous
Diseases of the Head. Of the Faeces may be made a second Decoction, which may

THe Countess of Northampion, (born of a noble Offspring, notably educated,
and of a very good disposition, very fair and beautiful,) in the seventh month
of her Childbearing, fell into a Bastard Tertain, as also a filthy yellow
Jaundice, Torment of the Belly and Head, and Pain of the Back, being aged about
26, desiring my advice, being not willing to purge, I prescribed as follows:
the Flowers of Marygolds and Rosemary, each p. i. Carduus benedictus p. ss.
Flowers and leaves of Melilot p. ii. boil them in sufficient Posset drink to

which the Fit was retarded two hours; it beginning, she took the other half,
which freed her from her shaking, then her Jaundice appeared in her Water
manifestly, after sweat broke forth, the next Fit was less. In the heat of the
Fever and sweat, she took the Decoction of Hartshorn, with Juice of Limons, of
which she drank liberally, in which Decoction she would not admit Rose Water.
On her quiet day she took every third hour the quantity of a Bean of the
following: Conserve of Barberries ss. Pull. Pan. rub. ii. but after she had
taken of it once, she abhorred it. She had a Gelly of Hartshorn with Marygold
flowers, and Saffron. The 22th of July, before her Fit, she had five grains of
Bezoar; and an hour before her Fit the foresaid Posset Drink. This Fit she was
troubled with shaking, but the hot Fit and sweating was less by six hours. The
23th day, by five in the morning it left her. She took this: Tincture of Coral,
Magistral of Pearl, each gr. iv. Pull. Pannon. rub. gr. xii. mix them. She took
it an hour before dinner, and an hour before supper. The 24th day by three a

Mrs. Fines, aged 22, 1632. (Wife to the Lord Says eldest Son, a very
religious excellent Woman,) was miserably afflicted with the following
Symptoms, viz. Obstruction of the Courses for the space of two months; and when
she had them at a fit time in a laudable quantity, they were of an ill watery
color, with great pain in the Womb; there was also difficulty of breathing,
with trembling and beating of the Heart, as if it would have burst through;
after sleep she was sick, with torment of the Belly, and gnawing about the
Navil, but these Pains were most miserable about the time of her Courses; upon
breaking wind she was somewhat eased; her Belly was also very hard, and moved,
as if with child; but hot Clothes being applied removed the Pain and Wind. She
was also vexed with pain of the Spleen, Whites, Leanness, Pain of the Loins, a
light Vertigo, as also of the Scurvy, and truly I judged all these Symptoms to
arise from it. Which I cured as follows: Pil. de Succin. ii. Ruffi. i. f.
Pil. N. 15. She took three at bedtime, and two in the morning, which wrought
excellently. For the Wind, Spec. Pleresarc. ss. Sacch. Ros. iv. Misc. Dose,
half a spoonful after meat. By the use of these her Courses flowed well, with
many lumps like Flesh, not dissoluble in water, they were expelled with
torment, as in Childbirth. To cleanse the Womb, Hier. cum Agaric. de Succin.

THou, O Lord, which have the power of Life and Death, and drawest from the
Gates of Death, I confess, without any Art or Counsel of Man, but only from thy
Goodness and Clemency, thou have saved me from the bitter and deadly Symptoms
of a deadly Fever, beyond the expectation of all about me, restoring me as it
were from the very jaws of Death to former health; for which I praise thy Name,
O most merciful God, and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying thee to give
me a most thankful Heart for this great favor, for which I have cause to
admire thee. About the 57th year of my age, August 27. 1632. to September. 29. I
was much debilitated with an immoderate Flux of the Hemorrhoids; yet daily was
I constrained to go to several places to Patients. By riding, a hardness being
contracted, the Flux was stayed for fourteen days. After I fell into a most
cruel torture of my Teeth, and then into a deadly burning Fever, which then
raged very much, killing almost all that it did infect, for which I used the
following method, which by the help of God succeeded. First, I purged thus:
Rubarb infused i. (surely it was infused in some proper water, suppose iii.)
Syrup. Diaserios i. Elect. e Succ. Ros. iii. This gave four stools. After I
used the Decoction of Hartshorn, and so the Disease was almost cast out by
Urine, it flowed very much for four days space; so that I was not only much
maciated, but also weakened, so that I could not move my self in my Bed without
help. I also had Convulsion of the Mouth and Eyes. Then was a Pigeon cut open
alive, and applied to my feet, to draw down the Vapors; for I was often
afflicted with a light Delirium. Then my Wife sent for two Physicians. I had
used a Clyster with Em^llient Herbs, and Electu. Diacath. and Leniti. By the
Physicians my Friends, was prescribed the following Electuary, of which I
swallowed the quantity of a Nutmeg twice a day. Elect. de Gem. call. ii. Spec.

observed, before the Physicians came, there were drawn vii of Blood from the
Liver vein, and three days after that were the Leeches applied to the
Hemo^^hoids, and thence removed x. After the Decoction of Hartshorn. Thus I
was pretty well able to take Meat. After I used Chalybiat Wine, with Juice of
Scurvy Grass, and Sir. Sceletyrh. (...), and purged once a week with Pull.
sanct. Sir. Diaserios, and infus. Rhab. For the pain of the Teeth I used Ol.

accompanied with the following Symptoms, with which she was vexed, as beating
of the Heart, Wind of the Stomach and the Belly, of which she found very little
ease, although she vented wind both ways. Her Mouth was continually dry,
although she could content her self with a little Drink. Her Pulse was
variable, weak, unequal, and often vermicular: The Heat in this Scorbutic Fever
was more gentle than in an exquisit, and joined with less thirst and
restlessness; or if it were much, yet it was by intervals. Her Urine was thick
and red, with the like sediment, unequal, yet thirst less. She was very subject
to fainting when she rose out of her Bed, with many other deadly Symptoms, yet
was she helped in a few days with the few following Medicines. Having great
torment in the Belly, there was injected this Clyster: the common Decoction for
a Clyster xii. course Sugar iv. fresh Butter ii. mix them. It gave two stools.
But before the Clyster was administered, she took the following Electuary: Spec.

DOctor Tbornberry, Bishop of Worcester, aged about 86, Febr. 1. 1663. was long
tormented with a Scorbutic wandering Gout, falsely imagined by his Physician to
be a true Gout, as appeared not only by the frequent Change of his Urine, both
in color and substance, but also livid spots in his Thighs. He had very
unquiet Nights from falt and sharp humors, and Vapors ascending to his Head;
and if he did sleep, it was with terror, which happened from the sudden
slaughter of one in his Family, which did much terrify and perplex his Spirits,
and afflicted him grievously with Melancholy. His Pain lay sometimes in his
Knee, otherwhiles in his Foot, without any tumor in the Foot, but about the
K^ee and Instep there was great swelling, and after in the Feet. I said he
might be eased, but never perfectly cured, which I effected as follows. I
omitted purging, he being very weak, and having been before purged. He had a
Gelly framed of Hartshorn, with Knuckles of Veal, Partridg, Raisins, Dates,
and Antiscorbutic Herbs. It being strained, there was added a little Tincture
of Saffron and Alkermes, with Sugar Candy to sweeten it. He took the Juice of
Scurvy Grass prepared in Wine twice or thrice a day. For the Pain and Tumor was
applied live-Worms, which I have often applied to others in like pains with
good success. Afterward I used the following, which removed the Tumefaction in
three or four days. The Feet were bathed with this: Brook-lime M x. boil it in
sufficient quantity of Beer, for a Bath; which was used morning and night.
After bathing, was applied a Pultess framed of the Powder of Wormwood, and
Yolks of Eggs. The first night he slept more quietly. There were used also
inwardly our Antiscorbutic Water, with the Juice of Scurvy Grass, as before, as
also the Gelly. He also had an Antiscorbutic Beer. By all which he was wholly
delivered from the pain and tumor in his Feet, so that he could walk abroad.

Mrs. Editha Staughton, aged 17, was miserably afflicted with Melancholy, her
Courses as yet not having broken forth, as also with the Mother; she was very
easily angry with her nearest Friends, so that she continually cried out that
her Parents would kill her, as also of all others that came unto her. She had
been purged well by expert Physicians, yet her Father desired my counsel,
whether she was curable; to which I answered, Very hardly, being her
Constitution was Melancholy. I advised there should be few to trouble her, and
so began with emollient and discussive Clysters, as also such as respected the
Humor: As of Chicken-broth (wherein was boiled Sorrel, Pimpernel, Borage,
Hyssop) lbi. common Oil iiss. Salt of Tartar i. make a Clyster. This was used
two days. After she was thus purged: of the foresaid Broth v. Cream of Tartar
iv. Oil of Vitriol 5 drops, make a Potion. By this the Humor was rendered more
obsequious. After was opened a Vein on the left Arm. She was the next day after
purged again. After was applied the Leeches to the Hemorrhoids. Again she was
purged with an Helleborated Apple, in which Apple was roasted i of Hellebore;
afterward the Hellebore was cast away, and the Apple given. Being well purged,
we labored to divert the Humor from the Brain by Ligatures and strong
Clysters, strengthening the principal parts with the following: Conserve of
Roses vitriolated, Borage, Bugloss, each i. candied Citron Pills, Conserve of
Clove Gilly-flowers, each ss. Spec. de Gem. Laetific. a^ ii. Hyacinth. praep.
i. Confect. Alk^rm. i. Spec. Diamarg. frigid. a^ iss. with the syrup of Apples
make an Electuary. The Dose was i before meat. To discuss wind, that Powder was
used, prescribed Observe. 34. Cent. 1. As, Coriand. praep. ii. Sem. Faenic. etc.
It was given after meat. There was also used the following Wines: the opening
Roots, each i. Bark of Cappar roots i. Sassafras iss. Wormwood, Groundpine,
each M i ss. Ceterach, Balm, Germander, each M i. Flowers of Borage, Bugloss,
Scabious, each p. ii. Broom leaves p. i. seeds of Fennel i. of Carraway, and
sem. Siler. Montan. of each i. All these were beaten, and put into a Vessel, in
which was put the shavings of Juniper, and there was poured upon them of
White Wind lbxxx. And so being well stopped, they were set in a Cellar. After
they were infused eight days, I took 9 lb of it, wherein I infused Rubarb vi.
Sena ii. Mechoacan ss. Dodder and Cinnamon, each ss. Cloves i. And so it was
used instead of Purges. It was given every morning two hours before dinner,
with taking some spoonfuls of Broth. After three days taking, she had that
prescribed for comforting the Brain and Heart. In all Medicines we added
Humectors. For her watching, I gave at bedtime a spoonful of Diacodium. This
caused rest, and in it she sweat. There was Tartar often used by reason of its
great force in contemporating Melancholy, and Atra bilis. And thus by the
blessing of God she was delivered from her Distemper.

MR. John Trap, (Minister, for his piety and learning second to none) about the
33 year of his age, of a melancholy temper, and by much Study fell into
Hypochondriac Melancholy, and pain of the Spleen, with some Scorbutic Symptoms,
viz. difficulty of breathing after gentle motion of the Body, beating of the
Heart, with fainting at the rising of the Vapors, and became a little better
when they were dispersed. He had a gentle Erratic Fever, so that he was much
amaciated; after he had done preaching on the Sabbath, he could scarce speak;
his Urine changed often, his Pulse was mutable and unequal, and he languished
much. Some ordinary Medicines were used, but not succeeding, he desired my help
and counsel, which was readily performed by me in prescribing the following, by
which he was restored from the very jaws of Death, both safely, quickly, and
pleasantly. March 11. 1635. Tartar. Vitriolat. iv. in pomo sub cineribus c^ct.
With this he had two Stools, and his Urine came in greater quantity, but like
clear Spring water. The 12th day, Merc. dulc. gr. xx. Tart. Vitr. i. Gut. Gamb.

Stools. The 14th day he took i of Cream of Tartar, it gave one Stool. For his
Cough and Catarrh, in the night he held in his Mouth one of our pectoral Rolls.
The 15th he took of our Chalybiat Wine; as Vin. Chalyb. iv. Sir. Sceletyrb.

exercising two hours after. For the strengthening of the Spleen, Raisins of the

2. he was purged as before, with which he was cheared for three days after he
took the Wine. The seventh day he purged with Cream of Tartar i. Now he had our
Antiscorbutic Beer; and his Electuary being ended, he took six spoonfuls of the
following Water: Aq. Limacum nostr. Aq. Ranar. simpl. a^ iv. Confect. Alkermes
ii. Manus Christ. perl. ss. Sir. Sceletyrb. Forest. ii. Aq. nost.
Antiscorbutic. vi. Splenetic. ii. (both Doncrelius) Misc. This being ended, he
desired his Electuary again, in which he said the greatest hope of his Cure
lay, and was worth Gold. He having it, used it for eight days, purging every
fourth day. But being much troubled with bitterness of his Mouth, I gave him v
of our Emetic Infusion, which removed it, and he returned to the use of his
Electuary. And thus by God's blessing he was freed from all his Symptoms, and
was well cured, for which he returned me hearty thanks.

THe Earl of N^rthampton, aged about 32, being following his Hounds in a cold
and rainy day, got cold, and suddenly was miserably tormented with a flatuous
Pleurify, and pain of the Belly, like to a true Pleurify. He had a small Cough,
was restless, feverish, thirsty, and the Pain was stretching. I being p^tient
when he came home, prescribed this Clyster: Decoct. com. pro Clyst. lbi,
Diaphaenic. Diacatholic. a^ i. Pull. Hol. ii. f. Clyst. This gave three stools
with much wind, and desired event, for the Pain was mitigated; yet in his
Breast he felt a pricking, to remove which was this prescribed: Vng. de Alth.
ii. Ol. Amygd. dulc. ss. dissol. and misce ad ign. pro Vng. With which his
Breast and Side was anointed, and upon it a double linen Cloth spread with
Butter warmed. By this the Pain remitted, and he had a quiet night, and fell to
sleep. The day following he used this expectorating Syrup: Sir. Scabios.
Magistral. Capil. Vener. Liquor. Hyssop. a^ i. Misc. He took it often upon a
Liquoris stick. In the night he held in his Mouth one of our Pectoral Rolls. In
the morning he was anointed again, and so was freed from all his pain, and he
became whole.

IN a Quotidian and Bastard Tertian, after the Body has been well evacuated,
the following has been often experimented by Thonerus: Carduus benedictus, and
the lesser Centaury, each M ii. Sometimes add Roots of Assarabacca boiled in
White Wind and Water to lbi. Of the straining exhibit iv hot for several
mornings, especially if the Members be tumified. It is to be taken in Bed,
sweating.

I remember great Zacutus in Quotidians and other of long continuance, when
other Remedies long used had proved fruitless, found most effectual iv of the
Juice of Fennel Roots, given in a morning with Sugar fasting, for ten days. It
is to be given in bed, being well covered; it most frequently provokes sweat
abundantly; in some it procures spitting of abundance of tough Phlegm; in
others it breaks wind both upwards and downwards. I cannot pass that of his in
Febris Epiala, wherein cold and heat, if felt at one time, caused from
pituitous gross Phlegm, and bitter Choler, which also is excellent in Bastard
Tertians, which is this: Flowers of Chamomel (I have experimented the Herb it
self, yea in various effects,) p. iii. tops of Roman or Pontick Wormwood p. ii.
boil them in three pints of Water till half be wasted; to the straining, add
Sugar iv. Vid. Author. Prax. Histor. page 592. and Prax. admirand. page 101.

is v or vi every day.

One more of Thonerus in the same page for a Quotidian in his Wife: Carduus
benedictus ii. Gentian root i. f. Pull. It was given in Wine before the Fit, and
cured her; it caused vomit. Hence it concludes, that Emeticks and Diaphoreticks
are more needful th^n Purges in intermitting Fevers.

OBSERVE. LXXXIV.
THe same Thonerus, page 76. and 79. of his Observations, gives us in two Cures
of a Quartan. The first of a Captain, of melancholy nature, livid aspect, black
beard, who having been molested with a Qu^^^n, and the Cure successlesly
endeavored by va^^ous means, and other Physicians, he cured with this:
Polipody of the Oak new gathered ss. the roots of Succory, Fennel,
Butchers-broom, and Sparagus, each ii. Wormwood, Centaury, Betony, Dodder,
Agrimony, Ceterach, each p. ii. both Maiden-hairs p. i. Sena iss. Agaric.

Galangal, each ss. with white Sarcenet make a Bag, for three quarts of Wine,
and Betony water, and of Succory, each lbss. Within a few days the Fever
remitted.

The other was performed upon a certain noble Officer, who although otherwise
he was of a robust nature, yet having long labored of a Quartan, other means
proving empty, it was removed by this: Gala. iv. Diagrid. praep. gr. vi. Crem.
Tart. ss. f. Pull. It was given in iii of Hydromel. It brought away abundance of
vicious Humors.

Zacutus tells us, he cured a contumacious Quartan, with opening the Salvatella
in the Foot, in Prax. Hist. page 596.

Riverius gives several Observations of the Cure of this obstinate Disease. One
of a Girl, aged 14, in November. 1630. who for two months labored of a double
Quartan, whom he cured by the infusion of i of Sena in his Aq. Febrifuga for
several days; the fourth taking, cured. Another aged 30, laboring of a
Quartan, December. in the same year, was cured by the same means, at the seventh
taking. These are both in his first Century, page 32. His Aq. Febrifug. you
surely have in his Prax. Med. chap. 4. lib. 17. We have him cu^ almost all
others with his Febrifug. which ^he gives you an obscure description of in page
319 of his Cent. In imitation whereof I framed a Powder of three parts of Merc.
dulc. and one of Croc. Metal. with which I have cured some. I will not say if
the Merc. could be got here twelve times calcined, that I had got his Secret;
but I should think I had got that which would prevail.

OBSERVE. LXXXV.
THe Author has given in some Observations of Distillations on the Eyes, of
none falling elsewhere, that I remember. Riverius in his third Century affords
us an Observation on himself, which fell out November. 17. 1644. The South Wind
blowing, he was troubl^d with a Catarrh and hoarseness. The second day of the
Disease he kept his Bed, and took nothing, only twice of an Hordeat at usual
times of eating. The third day he took a laxative Ptisan with i of Manna. The
fourth day he rested, his Hoarsness much diminished. The fifth day, a dry Cough
being present, a Vein was opened. The sixth day the Cough persevering, he took
Calomelanas i. cum Resina Jalap. gr. viij. It did little till toward evening,
when it gave two small stools; yet the Cough was altogether removed. I hope any
that have heedfully read his Observations may observe, that his Calomel. is
Merc. dulc. This I conjectured before the last Impression of his Praxeos Medic.
And in that I think the Case is undisputably resolved, if he compare his
Observation concerning Worms, and his Chapter about the same in his Praxeos;
only remember, it must be six times prepared. The same Distemper he cured
himself of with twice taking Laud. Opiat. the first time gr. 3. the next time
gr. ii Cent. 3. Observe. 69. Only this is observable in his communicated Observe.
viz. That in most violent Catarrhs nothing stays sooner than this of Rulandus:
Ferment. acriori^ ii. Carab. pulver. ii. f. Catap. which is to be applied to
the Suture, the hair being removed.

Thonerus tells us, that one being obnoxious to a Chronic Catarrh, other things
being fruitless, was cured with the following, drawn up into the Nose, and the
Decoction of Sassafras for Drink. Fol. Nicotian. cum Ol. Anis. praep. i. Flor.
Majoran. i. Mosc. gr. i. f. Pull.

EMpyema, a Suppuration from a Pleurisy, has not yet been mentioned, I might
heap up Observations of its Cure, both by operation of the Side, and by
internal means. I my self cured one that had made its own passage without
injection, only keeping a Leaden Pipe, an attractive Emplaster upon it, and the
Diet-drink prescribed by Riverius, in his Chap. of Empyema. And he gives us two
Observe. both which was opened, and after cured, Observe. 79. Cent. 1. and
Observe. 75. Cent. 2. To the latter, being a Child, for some days he applied an
emollient and attracting Cataplasm before Incision. Zacutus helps us with with
the like, Observe. 120. lib. 1. Prax. admirand. But for the cure of one without
apertion, take Thoner. Observe. 6. lib. 3. which he performed by helping Nature
to expectoration, although the Empyema was very grievous: Aq. Hyssop. V^ronic.

A Flatuous Pleurisy you have mentioned in Observe. 83. of this Cent. but of a
true Pleurisy there is no Observe. that I remember by the Author; we shall
supply therefore this defect from other Authors.

Riverius in Observe. 56. Cent. 1. tells us, after many bleedings, and other
ordinary Remedies, the fifth day the Fever continuing violent, as also the pain
in the Side, was cured by i of Frankincense roasted in an Apple, and eaten, and
after drinking Carduus benedictus water iv. Being well covered, he sweat a
little, with decrease of the Fever; the next day he sweat much twice or thrice,
and he became well. This I made trial of on one John Fort, whom I let blood
several times, and used both anointing and Linctures, yet all prevailed not;
only I repeated Thus de Pom. twice or thrice.

Zacutus in one of his Observations helped us to an Ointment which I have found
to answer expectation; it is this: Unguent. de Alth. i. Ol. Amygd. dulc. ss.
Misc. It Is thus to be used; after the pained Side is anointed with it hot,
there must be strewed upon it some Powder of the Flowers of Chamomel, upon this
a Cabbage leaf anointed either with Butter or Hogs grease.

Thonerus acquaints us, that he cured one by exhibiting ii of Oil of sweet
Almonds, with Henbroth hot; by this he cast up abundance of Phlegm, and gave
some stools: and this he often observed. Take one more of his, in which first
he opened the Mediana of the same Side. To mitigate the pain, was used this:
Ol. Amygd. dulc. ii. Sacch. cand. alb. i. Misc. By this the Pain was much
remitted, and he had ten stools after. Twice or thrice a day he took iij of the
following Decoction: the Flowers of red Poppies M i. Scabious water lbiss.
Waters of Carduus and Corn-Poppy, each iii. boil them gently with a little
Sugar make a Julep. This prohibited the Flux, and qualified the Inflammation.
To absterge, Waters of Hyssop and Carduus, each iss. of Scabious ii. of
Coltsfoot and Chervil, each iss. White Sugar candy vi. Man. Christ. perlat. ii.
Misc. In few days he became well, although the sick Man himself despaired of
Life.

environing the Pericardium, or Purse of the Heart, with a notable paleness of
Face, and livid Lips, with which was conjoined the Green Sickness arising from
a thick and tough pituitous humor mixed with Bile, as also the Obstructions of
the Meseraick. To cleanse the whole Body, open the Obstructions, and to

flowers, and Honey, each i. two yolks of Eggs, and half a pint of Henbroth, make
a Clyster. This was repeated; she highly commended the Physic and Physician.
Those Clysters in torments of the Belly retained two or three hours, oftentimes
so mollify the Excrements, that it is wont to provoke to more stools than a
purging Clyster. Thus Thonerus.

I have often given ease to Women, by exhibiting a draught or two of Chamomel
Posset Drink, with a Powder framed of Nutmeg, Anisseed, and Cinnamon. Zacutus
highly commends his Powder prescribed in Prax. Hist. lib. 3. chap. 20. That Is
more cheap, and may be as effectual, prescribed by Riverius, of Comfry roots

Riverius tells you, he cured one troubled with it joined with the Cholick,
first by purging with a Potion purging Phlegm, a Vein being opened the day
before, and also three days after, as I remember. After she took every morning
Spirit of Tartar ss. with the Decoction of common Wormwood. The second time
given, the Cholick vanished, and in continuing it for ten days, she was
perfectly cured. For drink she used White Wind, wherein prepared Steel had been
infused, which she continued for some time after. She was grievously afflicted
with Obstructions of Liver and Spleen, was thirsty, her Courses suppressed,
tension of the Sides, and a very ill color of the whole Body, her Cholick
afflicted her twice or thrice a day.

OBSERVE. XCII.
HEmorrhages of Nose, and some other parts, have been dispatched by the Author.
We shall give in briefly some of the Womb, out of others, and such only as are
after the Birth and Abortion.

Riverius tells us of a Woman, after miscarrying suffering even to the greatest
dejection of strength from an immoderate Flux of blood, whom he cured as
follows: He prescribed Frixions and Ligatures to the upper parts, Cups under
the Paps, also Epythems and Pigeons, fomented her hands with hot Wine, and
Confect. Alkerm. and the following Potion: the Water of Plantain, Orange flower
water, and Roses, a^ i. Syrup of Coral i. Sal. Prunellae i. Dragons blood ss.
make a Potion. Which being presently given, before the other Remedies were
performed, yea, within a quarter of an hour, her pain of Belly and Loins was
eased, and her Flux diminished, so that there needed no other Remedies.

And Observe. 96. Cent. 1. Thonerus informs us, that he cured a Citizens Wife of
Vlm, who in Childbed was sore troubled with Hemorrhoids of her Womb, with
fainting, to whom he gave the following: East Bezoar. gr. iv. prepared Pearl
ss. with Borage water i. Her Symptoms vanished. Magist. Coral. gr. xii. It was
given in Broth. For drink, Syrup. Granat. Coral. a^ iss. in Aq. in q. Frustual.

conclude, he tells us of a Maid suffering under the overflowing of her Courses;
when other things were fruitless, she was helped with Tincture of Coral, which
he says is so helpful, as that it may be noted as a white Stone.

OBSERVE. XCIII.
THe Stoppage of Urine, and Strangury, i.e. pissing by little, as drop by drop,
may be joined together; the one being a total, the other a partial suppression
of Urine; the total may be either true or bastard. The latter befell one Goody
Brown in Warwick, who could not make water at all, and yet no fullness on the
region of the Bladder, nor desire to make water. After I had used all means to
procure it, as Clysters, Ointments, Cataplasms, and Catheter, she died. I
opened her, and found her Bladder quite empty, and in her Kidneys several
Stones, one in each Kidney fallen into the mouths of the Ureters, or passages
of the Urine, like two Stopples, so that no Urine could pass.

Thonerus affords us an Observation of both Stranguria and Ischuria, with which
one of 70 years being cruelly tormented, as if in labor in casting out the
Urine by little and little, and yet fruitless, from the cold distemper of the
Bladder, with redundancy of Phlegmatic Humors, who was cured as follows:
Mallows, Pellitory, Mercury, Betony, each M i. Chamomel, Melilot, Dil, each

PAins in various persons are exceeding troublesome, and sometimes intolerable;
they come sometimes from outward Causes, as Sprains, Blows, or Falls; in which
case I have applied two Plasters with admirable success; one was Emp^^^^rum
C^^^^tum, vid. Mel. Chirurg. the other Melilot simple Others come from
D^fluxions, and of these receive these Observations of Thonerus*

A Woman troubled with a grievous (...) night and day of the right Arm, from
the shoulder downwards, with a Tumor, so that she could not lift it up, in few
days the Pain and Tumor was removed with this: Diacaleith. i. de Melilot ss.
Misc. It was spread upon Linen.

A Maid cruelly tormented with pain of the right Arm also, was eased in one day
with a Plaster of Taccamahacca spread upon Leather, as also many others, when
from a cold cause.

Another vex^^ with a great pain of the Loins, from a Defiux^on, was thus
cured: White-bread Crumbs infused in Milk, after (if you will) pass them through
a Seive, add the Yolk of an Egg, and fresh Butter, with so much of the full
(...) Oils as was fitting: Oils of Chamomel, Dil, white Liliies, each ii. of
Earthworms iss. mix them. The Pultess being spread on Cloth, apply it hot.
This gave present ease.

A Widow being troubled with the like pain, being aged 70 years, was cured with
this: Vng. de Alth. Anodin. a^ ii. Pingued. Cunic. iss. Ol. Scorp. ii. Misc. In
pain of Feet and Arms he often used a Cataplasm of new Cows dung, with Oil of
Roses, with good success.

One having a grievous pain in her Thighs, as if moved with Convulsion, was
cured with the following: Ol. Hirund. cum Castor. i. Aq. Therac. Cephalic.
Spir. Lil. Conval. a^ ii. Misc. It was used hot.

Another Woman having a grievous pain of the whole right Arm, was cured with
this: Oil of Earthworms, Fats of a Man, Dog, and Badger, a^ ii. mix them. It
was used hot. Another with a long pain of the right Arm, was cured with a
Plaster of Oxycroceum. Such Pains I have ofttimes cured with either Emplastr.
Crocatum, or else with Paracelsus, two parts, and one part of Oxycroceum,
dissolved with a little Oil of Dil.

THe French Pox has been cured by Thonerus as follows: A Woman infected
therewith, with Scabs, and excrescence in Anus, having been before under a
Surgeons hand, I cured thus: Elect. Diacath. Confect. Ham. a^ ss. Pull. San.

Sudorific and purging Decoction, taken for twenty days; and if this prevailed
not, he used Vng. Mercur. In the midst of Winter he (...) many with the said
Decoction alone, in which a Sudorific Diet could not be administered, by reason
of the sharpness of the Air.

He also gave in an Observation of a Child of thirty months old, which it
received from the Nurse, the Body being scabbed all over. Rasur, Lign. Guaiac.

spoonfuls of Panada sugared; upon it drinking a little Broth. This was used
every fifth day, and the Dose of both increased according to working. The
residence of the foresaid Decoction being boiled in three pints of Water, made
an ordinary Drink, adding Sugar and Liquoris to gratify the taste. These
Remedies continued a month, it became well. In our Mellif. Chirurg. is set down
a purging Drink that has cured several in Warwickshire.

OBSERVE. XCVI.
STruma's, vulgarly called the King's Evil, have been cured as follows, by
Zacutus, with the following, which he takes God to witness, never failed him:
Take the great root of Briony well washed, and cut it in small pieces, boil it
in lbiii of Oil, till it be wasted; to the straining, add Terbentine lbss. Wax
iv. and the Vessel removed from the Fire, make an Unguent. This he spread upon
Cloth, and applied it twice a day; if it be not ulcerated, it either mollifies
and resolves them, or brings them to suppuration. Therefore this Ointment draws
to it self by little and little the Humor turned into Sanies, cleanses the
Ulcer, mundifies, and incarns. If it do not bring away the roots, then put upon
the Ung. a little Sublimate, like a Mustard Seed* for this draws the Mucous to
it self. If upon the application of this, there follow heat, burning, and
inflammation, for some days content your self with applying the Ointment only;
if the heat and burning be very much, anoint the part with an Ointment framed
of a whole Egg, Women's Milk, and Oil of Roses. And so by degrees, although in a
long time, they may be happily cured. I have resolved great ones my self with
Empl. Crocatum, sometimes exhibitin^* Pills. Riverius cured one in a Maid's
Neck, after the fruitless use of many Medicines, with a Plaster framed of equal
parts of Empl. de Vigo. quadruplic. Merc. Vitriol. Roman. and Gum. Ammoniac. in
Aceto soluti and ruspissau, cum Terbin. s. q. which cured in a month. In the
mean time there was used a fit Diet, and sometimes convenient Evacuations.

OBSERVE. XCVII.
REtention of the Afterbirth is very sad, and usually brings with it Death, as
I have often observed, although sometimes it has been excluded some time after,
as appears in Riverius, and others, Zacutus professes he has delivered many
in this Agony by exhibiting iss of the following Powder in Wine with Sugar:
Carab, tenuis. pull. i. Castor. ss. Dictam. Puleg. a^ i. Cinam. i. Borag. iss.
Spicae. Nard. i. Myrrh. iss. Rub. Tinctor. i. Croc. gr. vi. f. Pull. subtilis.

Thonerus helped one with this: Troch. de Mirrh. i. Succin. alb. praep. iss.
Borag. gr. vii. f. Pull. It was given in the Waters of Mugwort iss. and of
white-Lillies ss. The Afterbirth was cast out within an hour after.

H^rstius acquaints us that this happens very often through the unskilfulness
of the Midwife, but always with great danger of the Mother; yet says he, by
the grace of God I have seen some delivered by the use of that Powder, which
Forestus commends, framed of the Troches of Myrrh, Seeds of Violets, Rad.
Dictamn. and Rasur. Dactilorum. Although he saw three or more, which after fell
into the suffocation of the Womb, and swooning, and within few hours died
miserably. That nearest to this of Forestus's prescription, is this: Rad.
Dictamn. alb. iss. Sem. Violar. Cinam. Elect. a^ ss. Rasur. Dactylorum gr. iii.
f. Pull. He exhibited in Wine, and proved effectual. May be Horstius substituted
Troch. de Myrrh. instead of the Cinnamon, and so made it more effectual.

OBSERVE. XCVIII.
I Shall conclude this Century with Tumors in various parts, being Observations
of several Persons. Riverius tells us, that a Woman's Breast being inflamed, by
reason of a Blow there received, and therein also was Milk that could not be
sucked out, he cured it, by the first day embrocating it with two parts ex Ol.
Ros. comp. and one part Omphacina. The second day, and the following he
continued the said Embrocation only to the pained part, and twice a day applied
to the whole Breast Vng. de Althea. And so without any other Remedy, in a few
days she was cured.

OBSERVE. XCIX.
THonerus cured a Merchant's Wife, who had very great Pain and Tumor on her
right Breast from a Flux of hot Humor thus: Mallows, and Violet leaves, each M
i. Chamomel M ss. boil them, and pass them; after add a pound of White-bread
crumbs, Oil of Roses ii. Oil of Chamomel, and fresh Butter, each iss. two Yolks
of Eggs, and so make a Pultess. You had best boil the Herbs and Bread in Milk.
This eased the Pain, and removed the Inflammation; and apostumating, it was
opened, to which was used this: Venice Terbentine i. Honey of Roses ss. Flower
of Wheat and Barley, each iss. put it in with Tents. There remaining some
hardness about the Paps, the following being applied, resolved it: Empl. Diach.
Mag. de Melilot. a^ ss. Misc. He cured another Merchant's Wife of a Scirrhus on
the right Breast, so that it was suspected to be a Canker, when other things
proved fruitless, with this: Empl. Diach. Mag. de Melilot. Ceronium, a^ i. Gum,
Ammoniac. in Acet. dissol. ss. Misc. He says, he also cured one that had a
hard tumor about the region of the Throat, as follows: Empl. Diach. cum Gum.
ss. de Melilot. ii. Misc. This gave no ease, but the following within a few
days resolved it: Empl. Diacch. cum Gum. ss. Ceronei ii. Misc. The same did
prevail in a hard tumor of the Scrotum.

OBSERVE. C.
ONe having a hard tumor on the right Knee, and having used several Plasters
and Ointments without success, his Knee being contracted, so that he could
neither extend it, nor could not go: I applied this: the Flower of Beans and
Barley, each ii. Bran well beaten M i. Goats dung beaten iv. Chamomel and
Melilot, each M ss. with Lixivium and Sapa, make a Cataplasm, to which add Oil
of Chamomel, and Dil, each i. And with this in a few days the Tumor was
resolved. The same Cataplasm Zacutus experienced, and highly comends it in his
Med. princip. Histor. in folio, page 571. Col. 2.

For Warts adhering to the Lip, and other parts, Thonerus experimented this:
Vng. Alb. Camphor. ii. Ol. Tartar. i. vel iv. Misc.

For watery Tumors in the Scrotum, he followed this Course: First he anointed
with Oil of Chamomel, afterward applied the following: Empl. de Bacc. Laur, cum
Sterc, capr. ii. de Melilot. vi. M. For Drink was used the Seeds of Anis.
Fennel, Carraway, and ^oots of Parsley boiled: this provoked much Urine.

Riverius cured an Infant thus: Farin. Hord. lbss. decoquatur cum Vin. gener^s.
ad Pultis consistentiam, d^inde add Oxymel simpl. i^i* f. Catap. It was
applied morning and night^

COUNS. XXXVII. Empyema.
THe Cure of Empyema's by Dr. Willis, communicated by another Physician to
Henry Stubs, Physician. He makes incision in the Side, when any Apostume is
broke in the Cavity of the Breast, either from a Pleurisy, or the Lungs, which
often happens (without any preceding Inflammation) to many People who never
complained of any Disease of the Lungs, nor ever suspected them to be unsound,
till on a sudden they are almost choked with the matter in the breaking of it.
And in these Cases when they spit a great deal of purulent matter, if at the
same time they feel any pricking pain in their Sides, whereby he guesseth it to
be in the Cavity of the Thorax, he first applies a Plaster to the very place to
help to break it, framed of Galb. Ammoniac. etc. By this Course in five days he
suppurated, and broke a hole in one Mr. Thornton in Northamptonshire, so that
the matter came out very well, and in short time his Cough, and spitting of
Corruption ceased; and when it began to cease running, he made it an Issue, by
putting in Pease, and kept it open a quarter of a year, till it healed of it
self, and the Gentleman is in health and strong at this time. But if he could
not suppurate it with a Plaster, then he makes Issues where there is any pain
or pricking felt, and in a week the Impostume comes to find a vent, and so
comes out in great quantity, and very stinking, and presently their Coughing
and spitting cease. By this means he recovered Mrs. Mildmay, and a Baker,
after the Apostume had lain in the Breast almost a month, and had spit a great
quantity of stinking corrupted matter; he made the Is^ue by Incision, only
where they found pain, and in no constant certain place.

COUNS. XXXVIII. Dropsey in the Breast.
THis afternoon a Patient having a Dropsey on the left side of the Breast for
at least six or eight weeks, insomuch that when he was shaken, the fluctuation
was heard as plain as if a Bucket or Pitcher half full of water had been shaken
or dashed to and fro. He could not lie on the contrary side without much weight
and oppression, as is always when only one Side is affected. He was tapped, and
there was taken out half a porringer of yellow water, not at all corrupt or ill
scented; and which is more strange, with heating it on a gentle Fire, it turned
all into a Gelly, just as Serum when a Man is let blood will do. There were
four or five by to give encouragement and hopes of recovery. To morrow the like
quantity is to be let forth, and so continue so long as his strength remains
good, which I believe will daily increase, for he has no bad Symptoms, and
seems to be troubled with nothing but difficulty of breathing. Two or three
have died of it, which was known after opening, which might possibly have been
healed with tapping.

COUNS. XLI. Scurvy.
FOr a young Lady laboring of the Scurvy, was advised by the same Doctor as

and not sufficiently satisfied in many considerable Circumstances, I judge it
safe to forbear, at least till Spring. Let her take any slight Clyster, about
four or five a clock in the afternoon, of three quarters of a pint of thin
V^albroth, or Posset Drink, in which has been boiled some Mallows, Violet
leaves, a few Chamomel flowers, and sweet Fennel seed, to which put iii of very

take this Vomit: infuf. Croc. Metallorum vi. Sir. e 5 Rad. ss. Sir. Viol. ii.
Misc. Let her first take a draught of warm Posset drink, and half an hour after
take the Vomit in a little of the same Posset Drink, and drink liberally of it
after every vomiting. That night at her going to bed, or at least three hours
after a light supper, let her take the following Pills, and the next morning
following: being very useful and requisite that the ill matter stirred up with
the Vomit, and put into motion, may be forthwith carried away, that so the
future Physic for opening Obstructions, and purifying the Blood, may be the
more effectual, not being affected and clogged with those corrupt humors; yet
in case the Vomit worked more strongly with her both upward and downward, that
she feels her Stomach weakened thereby, she may delay the Pills and Potion till
the next day. Pil. Stomach. simp. Alo. Ros. a^ i. Sal Absynth. gr. iii. Ol.

White Wind; distill with as gentle a Fire as possible, till all the Water be

M. or in Horse-dung, for eight or ten days before it be stilled. The Dose for a
Quotidian is seven or eight spoonfuls, before the Fit, the Party keeping bed,
and sweating two or three hours: if they drink, give them clear Posset Drink,

the Patient two or three days before, with a Decoction of Sena, Salt of Tartar,
Coriander seeds, and Liquoris, first boiling the Sena and Salt gently, and
after infuse the rest in the Decoction: Then in the first day of the
Intermission, give eight or ten spoonfuls, or more or less, according to Age,
Sex, or Strength; which continue three or four days, and you will seldom fail
of desired success. If with the use of the foresaid Remedies, you apply to the
Wrists the following Plaster: Take the powder of Briony or Hellebore roots, put
to it half so much Wheaten Flower, boil them to a Paltess with Milk. Which
apply to the Wrists for four days. He said in Quotidians and Tertians it never

two drops. At the first appearance of any Fit, raise a Blister in his Neck, and
whilst he continues indisposed give him a Clyster every day, and all that time

Other Directions for the same Child. Let a Nurse be got that has new Milk,
and let the Child suck her three or four days. If you see him still subject to
Fits, and to be heavy and oppressed in the Spirits, apply a Leech to each
Jugular Vein, take away an ounce of blood from each side, be careful to stop it
presently, for it will be apt to bleed very much. Apply the following Cataplasm

Bay Salt Mss. and as much Soap as a Pullets egg, and Oil of Scorpions so much

and Julep, but continue the Spirit of Hartshorn, giving with it night and
morning three spoonfuls of the distilled Water following; yet every Change and
Full of the Moon give the other Medicines. Give his Medicines a pretty distance
from his sucking, and especially give him before and presently after his

July 14. came the following. If he begin to loath his Medicines, leave them
off for a while, and take only the Powder and Julep, new and full Moon. Let the
Nurse instead of him, take the distilled Water morning and night, six or seven
spoonfuls; in the first spoonful let her take as much of the next Powder as
will lie on a shilling, and the rest after: Take seeds of Anis, Carraway, sweet
Fennel, each i. root of Male-Piony vi. Liquoris ii. Sugar Candy i. Make a

Prescripts done, so also give them to her. The Doctor taking notice of my
Ilness and Weakness, acquainted her Honor, if I did not forbear that
attendance, and betake my self to my Chamber at home, it might hazard my Life;
upon which her Honor unwillingly dismissed me. In the mean time whilst I was

Ladyship, who I may say was very tender of me, always allowing me more favor
than I deserved. The 17th of May, 1666. I bled with Leeches to vi. being weak,

purge, he prescribed this: Take the Linitive Electuary ss. Cream of Tartar ss.

little ease. Being more the next day, I bled again, and so the third day, till
I had ease, which removed it. After I took a quarter of what was left of the
Electuary, which gave me three Stools. My Cough still being troublesome, I took
of the thick Balsam of Sulphur the quantity of a small Nut, in a spoonful of
Syrup of Violets, at night, by which I found much advantage, and with which I
have cured very desperate Coughs. And in the mornings I took Spirit of Hearts
horn in my Ladies Snail-water, with Syrup of Viol^ts. After some time I took
every night and morning a spoonful of Syrup of Sulphur, which the Doctor
himself gave me Directions how to make, sending me the prepared Sulphur from

being again sent for to Warwick-Castle, to her Honor; he was pleased, hearing
I was alive, to come to see me, and finding me up and walking in my Chamber, he
took me by the hand with great gladness, and told me he much rejoiced to see me
alive, telling me, when he last left me he gave me up for dead, and asked me,
what Course I took for my recovery? I told him, I followed his Directions
exactly, only as to the quantity of the Purge, knowing my Body was very easy to
work on, and finding a Pain on my right side, contrary to his advice, I was
necessitated to bleed in the Arm. He told me, I had done very well in it. I
heartily thanked him, as for this last, so for all his Favors; and so we
parted.

Cream of Tartar in the first draught, in the mean time keep the body constantly
soluble, by taking i of Mastich Pills when you go to bed. Observe a good Diet,
otherwise they will be fruitless. You need not purge much beforehand, only
Manna may be sufficient. It Is best to take them at the Well, if Weather be

COUNSEL LXXIII. Miscarriage.
FOr an Honorable Lady, by an eminent Physician, to prevent Miscarriage, was
directed as follows:

The grinding pains in her back, being so young with Child, may be reasonably
supposed to arise from the stagnation of suppressed Blood in the Vessel there,
which either by its abundance, or Acrimony, quickly acquired by stagnation, may
procure Abortion. Al^ho there may be, and frequently are such Pains in the
Back, without Miscarriage, as you may very well know, especially if the Womb be
not distempered, nor the Ligaments thereof weakened. But being her Ladyship has
miscarried twice already, there is too much ground to fear such weakness, and
the ill Consequence. The Means indicated are the abatement of the Plenty by V.
S. the attempering and sweeting that acrimonious Acidity, and the strengthening
of the Parts affected. Bleeding from the Arm is earnestly advised, and truly if
the Pains do not considerably abate upon her first bleeding, I do advise the
repetition of it. I have so often advised it in such Cases, with so good success,
that I cannot but now recommend it: But then I would not have much (not above
three or four ounces) taken away at first, as being much safer, and effectual
to take a little at first, and to repeat, than to take too much at once. The
repetition of bleeding may be after a week, sooner or later, as you shall see
occasion from the recurring, continuance, or increase of the Pains, or other
Symptoms. As to the other two Indications, take of the next Powder i. in a
poched Egg, or with a little Broth, or other supping, once every day, during
the Pains, either in the morning, or at night, which may most please, or be
agreeable. Take roots of Tormentil, red Sanders, Kermes grains, Nutmeg, Pearl
prepared, red and white Coral, each i. Cloves ss. Leaves of Gold 2. Pearl'd
Sugar ii. f. Pull.

For outward means use the following Plaster: Take Galangal i. Bole Ammoniac,
Dragons blood, sealed Earth, each ss. Mastich, Myrrh, each i. Cyprus Nuts ss.
Juice of Mugwort, Venice Turbentine, each sufficient, mix them exactly; to
which may be further added red Sanders in fine powder ss. Wax sufficient to
make a Plaster. Of which spread one, and lay to the Back. These being observed,
Miscarriage was prevented.

COUNS. LXXXIV. Fever.
FOr the Cook Maid Servant to the said Honorable Family, by the same Doctor,
having a Fever, had directed what follows:

Take the emollient Decoction for a Clyster lbj. Lenitive Electuary iss. brown
Sugar ii. a little Salt, make a Clyster. This she took in the evening, which
gave her two stools. That night she took the next: Take Conserve of Violets j.
Diascordium ss. Salt of Wormwood gr. viij. make a Bole, for the hour of sleep.

The next morning, if she be not in a sweat, let her take the following in bed,
keeping her there; Take the Infusion of Cr^cus Metallorum ss. Wine of Squils
iss. Salt of Vitriol i. Syrup of Vinegar ss. make a Vomit. This did not make
her vomit, but gave her stools. After which was to be given Venice Treacle ss.
in a spoonful or two of Treacle water, and let her lie to sweat. This done,
take every sixth hour six or seven spoonfuls of the next: Take Waters of Balm
and Dragon, each iv. of Cardu^s, and Treacle, each ii. Syrup of
Clove-gillyflowers, iss. Pearl poudered i. Spirit of Vitriol sufficient to make
it presently tart.

Of the following she is to take a draught twice or thrice in twenty four
hours: Take the roots of Scorzonera i. of Valerian iij. candied Eringo's ss.
shavings of Hartshorn and Ivory, each iij. Raisins ij. boil them in Spring
water lbiij to lbij. add Sal. Prunel. i. and Sugar sufficient to sweeten it.

Every night and morning take Spirit of Hartshorn twelve drops, in the Julep.
Take a Clyster every second day. The third night were Blisters to be applied to
each Leg, below the Calf. And so she recovered.

At another time, falling into a Fever, notwithstanding fit means used, she
became light headed, and was given over as hopeless. I coming to see her,
having been abroad, they desired me to do something. I presently applied two
large blistering Plasters, to be applied to her Thighs, on the inside, about
the middle, which after drawn did run plentifully. And so she came to her
senses again, and recovered.

COUNS. LXXXV. Beating of the Heart.

FOr an Esquire of no small quality, afflicted with the Piles, had by a very
eminent Physician this Advice following.

Sir, A very spare Diet, and abstinence from Wine or other strong Drink (till
the Pain be assuaged, and the swelling removed) is one of the Principal
Remedies. Let Leeches be applied to the swelled parts, if they have not been
used already. If the Anus be protuberate and bear down, keep the same
constantly up and within your Body with the help of your Finger. Sit over the
Decoction of Mallows, Violet leaves, adding some Milk, being put warm into a
Close-stool-pan, and that not only when you have occasion, but even at other
times when the pain is most troublesome. Then coming from the Stool use this;
Take Barley meal, vi. Leaves of Violets and Mallows, each Mij. Flowers of Elder
and Melilot, each P.ij. boil them in sufficient quantity of Cows Milk, to a
Pultis; after add the Mucilage of the Seeds of Flea-wort and Quinces, drawn
with Plantain-water, each iij. Oil of Roses, vi. Oil of Linseed and Vnguentum
Populeon, each ss. and make a Cataplasm. Of this spread some on Lin^n cloth,
and apply it hot to the pained part, and as it cools warm it again, or lay on
fresh. After this has been used some time, then use the next. Take
Oystershells, burnt white in the fire, and after poudered i. Powder of burnt
Hartshorn vi. Oil of Roses iij. Honey sufficient to make a Cataplasm. Spread
of it upon Red Cloth, or thick Linen, and apply it hot.

After this is done, apply to the Anus the next. Take Linseed Oil ij. Ceruse
and White-lead, each ss. boil them according to Art into a Plaster, and spread
of it either upon soft Leather or Linen, use it after the former Cataplasm,
and remove it as often as you need.

If the Piles be inward and very troublesome, put up a little of the next with
the finger now and than.. Unguent. Basilic. vi. Alb. Camphor. iij. Ol. Ros. (in
qo. Milleped. in coct. fuerint) ij. Ol. Vitel. Ovor. i. Opii in tantillo. aq.
Sperm. Ranar. solut. gr. iij. M. Put up some when in Bed at night, as also as
before directed. Take thrice a day, Morning, four in the Afternoon, and an hour
before Bedtime, the quantity of a Nutmeg of the next. Take Old Conserve of red
Roses, i. Flour of Sulphur, iv. Syrup of red Poppies, sufficient to make an
Electuary. If your Body be bound, and the part be very painful within, cast in
the following Clyster.

Boil in water a Sheep-shead, wool and all, also leaves of Mallows and Violets,
each Mi. Flowers of Melilot Pij. add to x. of the straining, Weather-suet,
taken from the Kidneys, iss. Honey of Roses i. That you may find ease by these
means, is the desire of your humble Servant.

COUNS. XCII. Piles.
A Right Honorable Lady troubled with the Piles, was directed by Dr. Willis,
as follows.

Take Morning and Night, a draught of Posset drink, wherein boil two or three
tops of St. Johnswort, and one or two small leaves of Mullin. Give a Clyster
every, or every second day of New Milk, wherein is boiled a few Red Rose
leaves, Make an Ointment of Wild Flax with Hoggs grease, and apply it outwardly.

To make this Counsel bigger, receive the next, which has been found very
effectual. Take Pilewort, Roots and Leaves, Mi. Orpin, a good handful, Figs ij.
or iiij. as there is occasion; mince them as small as may be, that they may
dissolve in boiling the sooner. Tops of Elder newly sprung out 13: Beat these
together in a pint of sweet Cream, then boil it to the consistence of an
Ointment: Then strain it, and put it into a Gally-pot, and cover it well, it
will keep a year if well looked to. The Foeces sat upon, and kept close to the
part, are very good. For those inward a Clyster, only of Linseed-oyl, is very
excellent.

COUNS. XCIII. (...) Pox.
THis was (...) Stubbs's Collection, which take, as writ by himself, as to the
Small Pox.

Sir St. John Charnock of Shutford in Bedfordshire assured me that his only Son
living at Combridge, visited one that had the Small Pox, being sent home
thereupon, he fell very ill at his Stomach, Head, Back, as is usual before the
Pox; the next day he was well, and also on the third. The fourth day he seemed
mortally ill, with Vomiting and violent Fever; His Lady warmed him a quarter
of a pint of Malego Sack, and put to it a good spoonful of Sallet Oil, and gave
it him, holding an Orange to his Nose, that he vomited it not up; the next day
the Pox came out kindly, and he had but few in his Face, Hands, Thighs, nor on
his Body; He had no ill symptoms after, but sat in his Bed and played at Cards
till well.

His Man catching them, and being Lightheaded, got out in the Snow, he was
brought in, and had the same Potion, and although they were struck in, they
came forth again almost as black as Jet, yet with no ill Symptoms ensuing, but
he became immediately well and recovered. She gave him afterward sometimes a
little warm Maligo or Canary. This course he assured me he had tried many times
in their County, and always with the like success. November. 5th, 1671.

Boil them to the half; in the straining dissolve Dioscordium iij. and make a
Clyster.

Take a Sheeps-head bruised, Red Roses, two handfuls, Pomegranate Rinds, iss.
Flowers of Pomegranates ss. boil them in sufficient quantity of Water, till
they be well boiled. Strain it. Of which take half a pound (the fat taken clean
off) and in it dissolve Venice Treacle ij. Diascordium, i. One yolk of an Egg,
and make a Clyster, which Administer warm.

Take Red Coral, Crabs Eyes and Claws, each i. make a Powder, which divide into
six equal parts, take one in the morning in a spoonful of Syrup of Coral.

The following has been found very effectual;. Aromatic. Ros. i Sacch. alb. i.
M. Dos. as much as will lie on a sixpence upon some Toast soaked in either
Sack, Sherry or Burnt-Claret, half an hour before Dinner.

COUNS. XCV. Ague.
A Worthy Lady, whom I shall not dare to mention, being alive, afflicted with a
Quartan, had by an able Physician the after Directions, which did prevail.

Take Venice Treacle i. Sack iv. make an Infusion for half an hour, drink it an
hour before the Fit, and expect sweat. Repeat it for three Fitts: But this not
prevailing, the next was advised.

Take juice of Plantain iv. Sack lb^s. Drink it warm an hour before the Fit.
Take Terebintine sufficient for two Plasters for each Wrist, to spread on
Leather, upon which cast Frankincense, and apply them.

Take Rhenish-wine iv. Tincture of Wormwood made in White Wind, three
spoonfuls. Mix them. This is to be given in a morning, and to be repeated for
many days, and at four in the afternoon.

I remember Colonel Hawksworth was cured by taking a pint of Sack by Spoonfuls
(warm) before the Fit. And heretofore, and now lately, several have been cured,
after other proper means used by able Physicians, by a Plaster laid to the
Navil and Belly, framed of Turbintine and Olibanum in powder, and spread upon
Leather.

This put me in mind of a Noble Knight, who having an Ague had a pretty large
one applied. Coming to wait upon him, as I constantly did, and as it was my
duty to do, he asked me how it should be got off, his Ague then being gone. I
told him there was no way but to shave it off, which was done.

Doctor Stubs, has in his Collections what follows.
Two Boys, one two, the other four years old, the one of fair, the other of
brown Complexion, having both at one time a Quartan, the Mother also having the
same, being with Child, which caused her Miscarriage 10 weeks before her time.
After eight weeks, all were Cured (Generals premised) with a Decoction of
Plantain Roots, to which was added i. of Plantain seed whole. It was made in
Posset drink and given an hour before the Fit, and laid to sweat, this was
continued three or four times, and they were recovered.

I might here give several Medicines, which I have by me, said to be
Infallible, but they have sometimes failed.

When I have heard of the confident boastings of some, I have remembered and
spoken of a modest Answer given to an Honorable Lady by Doctor Barksdale, she
pressing much for the Cure of some of her own Family, and others afflicted with
it, he said, Madam, if I come in time I may do as well as others, but I shall
never promise the Cure of a Quartan, for this would smell too much of a Quack
or Mountebank.

Its true the Jesuits Powder has been much cried up for curing many, but says
Barbet, neither so safely, nor so soon, nor so pleasantly as the above named
Salts.

Some use desperate Remedies, which may hazard Life, or bring after them sad
loathsome Symptoms, and yet not Cure neither, which brings to mind the saying of
Lemery in his Course of Chemistry, Englished by Doctor Harris, Page 135. None
of the Arsnicks can be given inwardly, though several persons that have
ventured to give the white, pretend to have Cured with it diverse Diseases,
among others, the Quartan Ague. They venture to give as far as Four Grains in a
great deal of Water, and after that manner it will make one Vomit like
Antimony. But I can by no means allow of this Febrifugum, and would never
advise any Body to use so dangerous a Remedy. Nature does furnish us with
Medicines enough in conscience to provoke Vomiting without recourse to Arsnic.

COUNS. XCVI. Worms.
ONe of the Sons of the Right Honorable Robert Lord Brook, having the Worms,
had by an Eminent Physician the following prescribed.

Take best Aloes in powder and Venice Treacle, sufficient to make a Plaster;
lay it to the Navil.

Take Rubarb the best, sliced and poudred, i. Burnt Hartshorn i. Sweet Mercury
gr. vi. Mix them, and tie them up in a little Nodul. For half a pint of Beer
provide seven such Noduls.

Take cooling Cordial-water of Saxony, iij. Syrup of Violets and Roses
solutive, each ss. Spirit of Vitriol and Sulphur, each four Drops. Oil of
Wormwood distilled, one Drop. Mix them. The Dose is three spoonfuls first and
last, fasting one hour after.

By Doctor Napier was the following directed, for one of that Honorable Family.

Take Purslain-water vi. Syrups of Mints and Pomgranates, each i. Spirit of
Sulphur 4 drops. Mix them.

The next also was to be taken, Take Coraline, burnt Hartshorn, each i. Bezoar
stone, of the last ten grains, divide into six parts; take one every morning,
in a spoonful of the former Julep, drinking three or four spoonfuls after,
Sept. 10. 75.

I can tell you of an honorable Lady, whose pardon I crave, who gave a
generous Fee to an eminent Doctor (dead) as any was, that after many entreats
of a tender Mother, all which she received from him was, That Flower of Sulphur
given to i. was the best Remedy.

To an honorable Lady with Child, by Dr. Willis, was appointed this:

Take burnt Hartshorn ii. Spirit of Vitriol ss. let them be well-ground
together on a Marble, and take i in a spoonful or two of the Waters of Carduus
or Balm, three mornings together. And the same excellent Physician assured me,
that the best Medicine for the Worms was the Powder of Virginia Snake-weed; to
one of three years old ss. in Honey, or Panado, etc. to one of eight years i.
every New Moon, and Full, for Spring and Fall, for two or three months together.

COUNS. XCVII. Obstructions of the Liver.
FOr Obstructious of the Liver, in the Right Honorable Robert Lord Brook by an
Eminent Doctor was prescribed, the 20th of September 71.

Take of the Roots of Madder, Eringo's candied, Sparagus, Succory, each i.
Leaves of Agrimony, Maidenhair, each Mi. Tops of Roman Wormwood Mss. Currants
iij. White Tartar grossly beaten, vi. Salt of Tartar, ij. Boil them according to
Art in Water, lbiij. till lbi. be wasted, then strain it and clarify it with
whites of Eggs. The Dose is iv. in the morning, and at four or five a Clock in
the afternoon.

add Alo. Ros. i. Tartar. Vitriol. ij. Incorporent. and redigant. in Mas. f.
Pil. ea magnitud. qa. 3s. pendul. i. His Honor is to take one at Bed time; If
that give not two stools more than ordinary, then take one the next morning.
His Honor taking one that wrought much and made him very ill, commanded me to
write to the Doctor, who returned the following Answer.

Mr. Cook, I should have been much troubled at my Lord's illness in the
operation of the Pill, did I not confidently hope that his Lordship will be
much the better for it. For besides that it is a good opening Pill (in the
general) both of Liver and Spleen. It Is particularly proper for my Lord to open
the stoppages of his Liver, and to carry off the surcharge of the matter, which
must be done gently and gradually. Therefore though I cannot but heartily
commend the use of the Pill to his Lordship, yet it must be so ordered as to
have it work not too much, by making the Pill not above half so big, or less as
you shall see reason. You know that a copious evacuation of matter, though
peccant, in some bodies will cause great disorder for the present, and
sometimes occasion an Ague* therefore the Pill must be proportioned
accordingly, and I hope it will be so, as that my Lord may be encouraged to use
it sometimes. And Mr. Cook, because I know that the opening Apozem will be much
more effectual with the assistance of such a Pill, than without it, therefore I
desire you to see that all the ingredients be in, and good, chiefly the Salt of
Tartar, which is often base and sophisticated; besides they are apt to leave it
out, as thinking that the white Tartar may only serve. I pray you, Mr. Cook,
pardon this trouble, and instruct me how I may answer for it, and for your
other kindnesses to

Sir, your affectionate Friend and Servant, etc.


COUNS. XCVIII. For the same.
FOr the same Right Honorable Lord, for the former Obstructions, was by
another Eminent Physician directed as follows.

November. 22. 1671. Mr. Cook, I had the last, which gave me an account of my
Lord's condition; those gentle evacuations may be of service to carry off those
Humors, which make their Mischiefs in the parts of Nutrition; and I hope, if
the Disease be not obstinate, his Honor is wholly relieved before this time.
Your Letters say nothing of his Cough, so that I conceive that has in some
measure left him. I beseech you continue your kindness to let me know fully how
my Lord is, and I shall be more ready (as I am most highly obliged) to give the
utmost of my assistance, and do him service; to whom I beseech you give my
humble service, and to my good Lady. I am your most faithful Friend and Servant.

The Season being cold, and his Honor going on with the former Course for some
time, and being considerably well, of which giving the Doctor an account, the
next, April 2. 72. I received the following.

First, open the Basilica of the left Arm, and take away eight ounces of Blood,
after use the next Prescriptions:

Take Pulp of Tamarinds i. best Rubarb poudered ss. make a Bole. Take it the
next morning, an hour after drink Posset Drink, with Syrup of Violets iss. Sal
Prunell. ii. Let it be repeated for four Doses, for every, or every other
morning, according as it works.

afternoon, drinking after a draught of the following:

Take of the fresh roots of Scorzonera, Succory, Eringo's, each ii. Leaves of
Straw-berries, Sorrel, Endive, each M i. Currants iv. Seeds of Melons, and
Pippins bruised, each i. boil them in sufficient Barley water to lbiv. remove
it from the Fire: add of both the Scurvy grasses, each M i. Let them stand
covered, to infuse till cold; after strain and clarify it; and then add Syrup
of the five Roots iv. sweet Spirit of Salt ss. The Dose, six ounces.

Continue the use of the Electuary and Decoction for three weeks.

COUNS. XCIX. Miscarriage.
A Right Honorable Lady, after Miscarriage, was advised by an eminent
Physician to the following:

Mr. Cook, I am come this morning from the Country, and have scarce time enough
to peruse your Letter before the departure of the Carrier. I am very much
troubled that her Honor has miscarried, yet do hope that her Ladyship's next
Conception will be more happily carried on. What may conduce to it, by
correction and strengthening of her Womb, shall be studiously advised by the
next return, which will be full time enough, in regard that the usual cleansing
of the Womb must be performed first. Being in haste, this is all, save that I
am your most faithful Friend and Servant, etc. Feb. 29. 71.

The 6th of March 71. came the following: First her cleansing over, let her
Ladyship purge with the next: Take Mechoacon sliced thin ii. Sen^ cleansed iss.
Coriander seeds p. iss. boil them in Water viij to v. strain it, and in the
Liquor dissolve the purest Manna, Syrup of Violets, and Juice of Oranges, each
ss. after clarify all with the White of an Egg, and then add Cinnamon water i.
and make a Potion, for two Doses.

Take China thin sliced i. roots of Masterwort, and Avens, each ss. Betony M i.
Feather-few M ss. the tops of Marjorum p. i. Nutmegs ss. boil the China in
Water lbiij to lbij. after put in the rest, and boil it at a moderate Fire to
lbiss. strain it, and clarify it, and sweeten it with double refined Sugar.
Renew it every fifth day. It attemperates and strengthens the Womb. Take it
every morning in bed, an hour or two, or more, before her Ladyship rises; and
if it agree with her, I would have it taken three weeks or more. My Lady is not
to observe any Diet whilst she takes the Apozem, nor fast after, unless she
pleases, longer than two hours.

COUNS. C. Lightness of the Head.
THe Right Honorable Lady, Katherine Brook, Dowager, troubled with Lightness
of the Head and Vapors, had by Doctor Willis directed as follows.

Mr. Cook, her Honor being troubled with Lightness of the Head and Vapors, it
will be requisite to lose Blood by Leeches, to vi. or vij. Purging a day or two
before, if by the use of what is directed her Ladyship should not do well, I
would advise her Honor to Astrop waters, as the most likely means to reduce
her Blood to better temper. My very humble service to her Ladyship, and to all
the Honorable Family; This is all, save to tell you, that I am your very
faithful Friend and Servant.

Take of Mastick Pil and Rubarb in powder, each ss. Salt of Wormwood i. Oil of
Rosemary distilled 8. drops; Gum Ammoniac dissolved in Snail-water sufficient.
Mix them, and make 12 Pills, which guild; they are to be taken three in a
morning once a week, and to be given more or fewer as they work, drinking Whey
after them.

all, for two or three months.

Brew some Middle-Ale for a Vessel of six Gallons, Boil in the Wort 4 handfuls
of Fir, 2 handfuls of Rosemary-chips, and hang in the Vessel of Sage and
Scurvy Grass, each Mij. of Dock-Roots sliced and dried, vi. Tap it at a week
old, and make one Vessel under another.

FINIS.
DIRECTIONS For such as drink the Bath-Water. Collected by H. S.
Revised and approved by Sir Alexander Frasier, principal Physician to his
Majesty.
THere being many unthought of Inconveniences, and many unexpected Accidents,
which frequently befall such as resort unto, and make use of the hot Baths in
Europe, by way of drinking them medicinally; the best provision that can be
made against such perilous Contingencies, is, that the Patient regulate
himself according to the most rational and exact Rules of Physic; and having
duly prepared the Body according to them, before he begin to drink, that he
pursue a most orderly Course of Diet, and cautelously deport himself in all
those Circumstances, which Physicians include under that Notion.

Upon this account it is, that the universal Consent and Practice of Mankind
seems to have enacted this into a standing Law, That none should wantonly, and
with contempt of all Dietetical Rules, make use of those Mineral Drinks; but
that all Circumstances relating thereto, should be conformable to Moderation
and Temperance.

It behooves therefore such Persons to avoid, during such a Course, all
surcharge of Meat, all excess of Drink; that they neither indulge themselves
with too much sleep, nor maccrate or inflame their Bodies by immoderate
watching; that they neither debilitate Nature by so violent exercise as may
introduce a Lassitude; nor retard the distribution, digestion, and evacuation
of those Mineral Waters by Sloth and In-activity; that such excrementitious
Collections, as Nature customarily produces in human Bodies, be duly
evacuated, and neither too long retained, nor too precipitously discharged;
that the Mind be composed into such a cheerfulness and gaiety, as may prevent
all disorderly Passions and Lusts.

The Effect of the Bath-Waters being drunk, is, to discharge the whole Body
from all Impurities that are incorrigible; to correct those that are capable of
Amendment; to free the innate heat or Ferments of each part which are oppressed
through any surcharge, or peccancy of Humors; and to restore or revive those
that otherwise languish, or are some way decayed.

And this is done, not by any one manner of Operation in them, but by their
complicated working at one time of sundry evacuations. It is manifest, that
they operate by Stool several times, once, twice, thrice, four times, or more.
It is no less evident that they operate by Urine, so as to discharge themselves
oftentimes in a greater quantity than what is drunk, commonly in an equal
quantity, and frequently in a proportion somewhat less; of the last instance
there being several degrees observable. It is also manifest, that they promote
not only insensible Transpiration, but Sweat; the latter being more or less
copious, according to the Constitution of the Patient, antecedent Preparation,
and the ambient, whether taken abroad in the open Air, or in Bed. The Effects
they have in reference to Transpiration insensible, are particularly evinced by
this Observation of the Laundresses in Bath, That those which drink the said
Waters, do foul their Linen more than other People do, or than themselves do
at other times, when yet it is equally worn.

I doubt not, but that others as well as my self, may have observed, that
several Hypochondriacal Persons have found another Operation in those Waters,
viz. That upon drinking them they have found their Spittle attenuated, and the
discharge thereof by Salivation increased at the beginning. The like Effect I
have seen in some Pulmonicks.

Neither is it to be supposed, that these Waters discharge themselves purely in
an insipid, limpid, aqueous Urine. For (not to mention sundry ways, I have
tried and discovered Heterogeneous Contents in such Urine) I have seen a Person
deeply and inveterately Hypochondriacal, who avoided his Waters at the
beginning (and yet they passed well) deeply tinged with Choler, as much as is
to be seen in the Colic Bilious. I have also seen Persons, whose Lungs, Head,
and Habit of Body, were oppressed with viscid Phlegm, to avoid Urines, which
though pale, yet by the lasting consistence of viscid Bubbles, and ever great
Froth thereon upon any agitation, sufficiently showed the mixture of the
dissolved Phlegm. And when they pass much in the night, they come away more or
less tinged, according to the Nature of the Patient, the Disease, the Method
and Circumspection used for his Cure.

The Operation of these Waters being such, as it is not difficult for an
intelligent Physician to conjecture in what Diseases it is requisite or
beneficial to drink these Waters; so it will likewise seem evident, that a due
preparation is necessary for such as expect benefit thereby. Neither will any
knowing Physician imagine, that the exhibiting of one Dose of purging Pills, a
Potion, or a Bolus, is a sufficient Preparative for the successful drinking of
these Waters. For seeing that a stable Health consists herein principally, that
the Excrements of the first, and subsequent Concoctions be discharged by all
those ways whereby these Waters do operate. And since that in morbid Persons
there are not only Depravations in the Chyle, Mass of Blood, and other
Alimentary Juices; but also in the Chyliferous, Sanguiferous, Lymphatic Vessels
Nerves and Glandules, (not to mention other things) the universal Amendment
whereof is no less requisite to a constancy of Health, than it is to Liquors,
what they are, and through what Canals they run; no understanding Person will
conclude otherwise than that according to the several Constitutions and
Indispositions of Patients, there must be different Preparations made, (and
those in conformity to the Methods which solid Physic prescribes) before they
can propose to themselves any great or durable benefit by the use of these
Waters.

Let us then inculcate that Aphorism of Hippocrates to all such as shall repair
to these Waters, Corpora qui purgare volet, fluida efficiat oportet: He that
would conveniently purge any Person, must dispose the Humors to a fluidity, and
relax the Passages first, by which they are to be evacuated. To the most
beneficial operation of Medicaments, it is requisite that there be an universal
(...), that the Humors be fluxile, and the Passages pervious: The which is so
much the more to be regarded in respect to the Bath-Waters, because they do not
as other Medicaments, operate after one determinate manner, but more
catholicly. But more especially Obstructions of the Mesentery are to be
regarded, because the Waters are more particularly to pass through those parts.

Let us also lay down this for another Rule, that these Waters are not to be
looked upon as being in themselves an entire Course of Physic, but that
subsidiary Helps of Purges, and other Medicaments, appropriated to respective
Diseases, will be requisite to the completing of their Effects. And if the
solitary or immethodical use of these Waters has ever been successful, (which
is not to be denied) the f^rtunate Rashness of such Persons ought not to be
drawn into a President, by the considering part of Mankind; there being so many
Instances of their being unsuccessful, and sometimes prejudicial, through the
neglect or ignorance of this Caution.

These things being premised, the Manner of drinking these Waters, which the
Generality of Persons ought to follow, and which Reason it self dictates, is
this:

I. That they begin with drinking of the Waters, and conclude (if their
condition permit) with bathing. For Bathing is but a particular and local
Remedy, Drinking a more general or universal. Therefore according to the
established Maxims of Physic, the latter ought to precede the former. Besides,
the drinking of these Waters, by opening Obstructions, attenuating some, and
evacuating other Humors, does prepare the way for Bathing, whereby the Relics
are evacuated by sweat, and the habit of the Body corroborated. But reiterated
Bathing does not prepare the Body for drinking; if it open the Pores, and
discuss some Humors, it attracts into the Habit of the Body others that are
crude, gross, and unfit to be discussed by sweat or transpiration; it puts the
Humors lodged in the Hypochondria into an Aestuation and Turgency, and raises
Vapors as well as Defluxions upon the outward and inward Parts. Also Bathing,
being accompanied with sweating, hinders evacuation, by Stool and Urine, and
consequently puts Nature into a Course altogether opposite to what is to be
expected and wished in the drinking of the Waters. From whence it is manifest,
that to begin with a Course of Bathing and Sweating, and to terminate with a
Course of drinking the Waters, is not only irrational, but dangerous, viz.

sed and geminato morbo majus aegroto malum creemus. Jam vero aquas medicatas
Baln^o usurpatas in l^calium numero esse notius est, quam ut pluribus probari
debeat.

I cannot but here take notice, that sometimes, when the Waters have not passed
well by Urine, I have caused the Patient to go once or so into the Cross Bath,
and there caused them to stay about half an hour, or more; and after that
commanded them to rise without sweating much; and hereby, (together with
Phleboromy) I have effected that the Waters have passed freely afterward: the
Vrinal Passages being relaxed and opened by the moderate Heat, and other
Qualities of that Bath. Also in Persons of a Phlegmatic Constitution, be it
natural or morbid, I have directed that they should use the Cross-Bath for a
week (neither continuing long in, nor sweating much afterward,) before they
drunk these Waters; there being no fear that in such the Hypocondriacal
Aestuations should arise, or that any Catarrhous Pains should happen; but
rather that the cold and viscid Humors should be attenuated, the Vrinal
Passages expedited, and the Body with ease prepared for subsequent Physic, and
drinking of the Waters.

II. That they begin to drink these Waters by degrees, proceeding from a
smaller quantity to a greater; and having arrived to the largest Dose, there to
stay several days; and then by the like degrees contract their draughts, until
they desist. The whole Course of drinking being thus finished in fourteen days,
or twenty days at most.

ARS COSMETICA: Collections from Persons of great Quality, being choice
Receipts for the Beautifying of the Face and Body; by Dr. Stubbs.
These following were the Receipts of a Maid of the Duchess of Orleans, and
after a Gentlewoman to an honorable Lady in this Nation: She was eminent for
Cosmetics; and these were particularly commended to my Esteem by the said Lady.

To make Spanish White.
TAke a glased Earthen Pot of four or five pints, anoint the Pot with fresh
Lard of a Male Pork, then fill it with good White-wine-vinegar, and put in a
good quantity of new-laid Egg-shells; then cover the Pot with a leaden Cover,
and bury it in the Ground for three or four weeks: then take of the White that
sticks to the Cover of the Pot, and keep it for your use.

A Pomade for the Face.
Take six dozen of Sheeps Feet, break the Bones, and take out the Marrow; then
boil the Feet well, and scum off the Oil that rises, and save it in a new Pot,
with the foresaid Marrow, to which put the four great cold Seeds peeled and
beaten well, and mixed with the Marrow. Then take the Rind of one Citron, two
pennyworth of Borax, three Cloves of white Lilly roots well beaten, a little
white Rose Water, or Plantain-water; boil all together for the space of two
hours, then strain it into a Dish of Spring Water, and wash it with diverse
Waters till it be white. Use this at night.

To make Gloves to whiten the Hands.
Take new Gloves, to every pair an ounce of Virgins-Wax, and as much Sperma
Ceti, Camphire and Borax, each the quantity of a Bean; Oil of Gourd seeds, or
any other of the greater cold Seeds, j. Pomatum, as much as a Nut; melt all
together. Then turn the Gloves, and dip or spread it on the inside, and let it
cool; then rub it in before a gentle Fire. Then grease them very well with ii i
of any Oil of the cold Seeds to each pair, then turn them again, and lay them
in a course damp Cloth, not touching each other for twenty four hours. To make
them the cooler, hang them upon a Line in May, to air for eight nights.

To make the same an easier way.
Take of the Oil of the four cold Seeds drawn by expression without Fire i.
Pomatum as much as a Nut, White wax ij. Sperma Ceti i. Camphire, the quantity
of a Nut; Borax poudered ss. Melt the Wax, then put all the rest in, and last
of all the Oil; when all is melted, (when it is warm, and never boils or is
near it,) dip the Gloves in, and rub it well in all over; open them, and let
them cool. That you may rub it in the better, you must draw the Gloves, being
turned, upon your hands, when they are cool. Wear them night and day under
others, to make the Hands smooth and white.

For the Lips, a Pomatum.
Take Oil of sweet Almonds iiij. red Wax ss. melt them together over a
Chafing Dish. Steep ii of Alkanet roots in a Glass of Rose Water twenty four
hours, when it is red, put in the said Pomatum into the Water; stir it together
until it look red, then let out all the Water, and keep it for use.

Pomatum for the Hair, to make it grow.
Take of Bears grease lbi. Virgins wax iiij. white Lilly roots, five or six
cloves, white Honey, and of the Essence of Honey, each i. boil them all for
half an hour in a new earthen Pot, either in the Water of Walnut-leaves, or of
Honey distilled, two or three pints, boil them well, strain it, and wash it
till it be white.

To make Butter of Oranges or Jessemins.
Take Barrowes grease picked and washed iiij. to which add of the Essence or
Oil of Jessemin or of Orange flowers i or ij. as you please to have it scented
higher or lower; add Virgins Wax ii. put them into a Silver Cup or Pot close
covered, and set it in a Skillet of Water, yet so that none come into it. Make
it boil apace, so as to melt the Stuff, then pour it hot into a Silver Basin,
and beat it so long till it is become very white, without adding any Water.

A Paste for the Hands.
Take of bitter Almonds blanched, and beaten to Paste with Rose water; sprinkle
them with the Yolk of an Egg, which has been beaten with Sack, add thereto
Bean-flower to make a Paste.

A good Water for the Complexion.
Take of Sea-Purslain the smallest, put it into a Glass Vial, with a like
quantity of the Juice of Limons; let them sleep fourteen days, and then set it
in the Sun nine days; then wash with it evening and morning. Fumitory Water
distilled in Balneo, is good for the Complexion.

Another Water for the Complexion.
Boil of French Barley M j. in Water lbij. strain it, let it settle, take of the
clear lbiss. and make therewith Almond-Milk with bitter Almonds blanched and
beaten lbss. adding to it two Glasses of White Wind; or if the Face be red, add
so much Vinegar instead of the Wine.

Against Sun-burning or Morphew.
Anoint them with Oil of Walnuts thrice in the three first evenings in March.
If the Party has a shining Complexion, and fatty, mix with the Oil so much
White Wind, and beat them well together before you use them at night.

To make the Verjuyce of Montpelier, which is highly esteemed in France for the
Complexion.
Take of the best Verjuice two quarts, put to it Litharge of Gold, washed
before in Plantain-water, and dried, lbi. beat it to powder, and put it and the
Verjuice together; di^til it in Balneo for use. It is also very good for a red
Face.

To make Teeth white.
Take of Aqua fortis, fair Water, Honey, each ii. boil all these together, and
scum them well, and rub the Teeth with this, and they will be as white as Snow.
Lucatella of Venice.

To preserve the Hair.
A Right Honorable Countess yet living, never used any Powder in her Hair, but
only in March and September, which being well rubbed in, was carefully combed
out at the same time; and every week she had the roots of her Hair carefully
rubbed with Jessemin Butter, and rubbed out with a Cloth, to take off any
Dandriff or Scurf of the Head, which might rot it at the roots.

To dye the Hair black.
Take powder of black Lead, and put it into fair Water a while, and it will
color it black; then wash the Hair you would color with a Sponge wet therein,
and cleanse the Head every morning, and repeat the Wash, for it will color,
and come off upon any Head-cloth. This was used by an honorable Countess, and
a Lady; nor was it possible to discern the color, tho both their Hairs were as
red as Foxes. Their Eyelids were colored with the steam of a Candle, gathered
in a Pewte^, and put on with a small Sponge.

FINIS.
