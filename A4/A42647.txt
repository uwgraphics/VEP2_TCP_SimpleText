The Modest CAVALLIERES ADVICE: Together with a Letter to the Inhabitants of
the Isle of VVight, where his Sacred MAJESTY Is now remaining.

Printed in the Year, 1647.

The Modest Cavaliers Advice, together with a Letter to the Inhabitants of the
Isle of VVight, where His Sacred Majesty is now remaining,
I Shall present this little Pamphlet unto your view, in this doubtful and
dangerous time, not only to show you the dependency betwixt our King and
Kingdom; but also to comfort and strengthen you against all fears that are or
may be interjected by the subtlety and malice of our Adversaries, or our own
misconceit or diffidence; for as I find the enemy busily practicing to
discourage us, and to raise false fires to affright us, so we our selves (as
melancholy persons) are apt to misconstrue all things, and to imagine the
worst, upon the sight of every shadow; there are many that labor to effect a
division betwixt us, by offering fair resemblances, and great promises of
preferments, but I trust the general disposition of an honest hearted Cavalier
is not to waver, that is to simile those persons which are light of love, who
desire to shift their old approved friends for fresh Suitors, and prefer the
change of an adulterous bed, before the married; if any there be which by
chance may be allured by this strumpet of the night, I verily believe in the
morning their eyes will be enlightened, and take it to be but a fit or throw of
passion, which will be easily cast off with more loathing and detestation, then
it was pursued with longing: I write not this to detect any of unconstancy; but
only to stand as a Centinell, or Watchman to give warning at the coming of so
many blood thirsty deceivers: And for the State it self (I mean that maine
Axeltree whereon our Kingdom turns) which is the sincerity of our King to his
friends, I do assure my self it is the same it was, and that we only move
whilst he remains constant; many may imagine otherwise as simple Passengers
sailing swiftly by the shoares, or continent, suppose the Trees, Steeples, and
Towers to go backwards: Let us not be distracted and affrighted with our own
shadows; ignorance makes us Infidells; lo we are brethren, yet I must
confess that Brethren oftentimes wax suspicious each of other; but let us
agree, for suspicion raises rumors, and those rumors, though false, may in
time beget and nourish a dangerous hate betwixt us; that which I write may make
us more confident of each others love, or at least shall have that effect in
us, until we behold the issue, which I hope at the last will be happy: The
Bell rings out, and I hear the sound and report it gives on both sides; upon
the Parliament side all men fear the passages, and carriages of all things,
and considering these things, are very liberal and free in their discourses,
and making their fears great, as indeed the cause requires: On the other
side, some shallow brained Traitors are doubtful of the King, and being
filled with mad jealousies and fears, prosecute his Majesty with all kind of
Calumny: Reproaches, and Pasquills are day by day invented, huancries
countenanced, and the inventers of them rewarded; base Libells and Scandalls
are cast abroad thick and threefold, one upon the neck of another, wherein not
only the King, Queen, and all their Royal Progeny; but also all his Majesty's
Loyal Subjects are very basely abused: This comforts me, and assures me that
they persecute none of their own, and therefore behold his Majesty, and all
that love him to be their utter enemies.

Thieves and Traitors have always a knawing in their consciences, and as the
Phrase is, simile, simile gavdent, they cannot endure any that displayes their
plots, and will not be Adjutators in these bloody designs: Let this assure
us, that his Majesty is the some we would have him, but for my own part I
comfort my self especially, and desire you would be comforted against all
fears or plots laid or plotted against us out of two considerations. First,
the goodness and mercy of our God. Secondly, the wisdom and policy of our
King. First, let us consider we have a good and glorious God watching over us,
who will not suffer his truth to be extinguished, but as he has hitherto
miraculously preserved it, so still he will continue to do the same: The Lord
visits the transgressions of his children with the rod, yet will he not utterly
take his mercy from them, nor suffer his truth to fail: Let us then rest in
peace, for he that keeps us does neither slumber nor sleep, and let the
remembrance of those many former deliverances, which he has wrought for us,
assure us of the like fatherly care and protection still, if we faithfully and
constantly depend upon his merciful promise. Secondly, remember the wisdom of
our King, which is so renowned, as for it, he is admired of all, and let this
comfort us, and assure us that God has not given him so much light for
nothing, much less for evil: Let us think that since he has been served by
us with so much obedience, that he will so much neglect his own honor and
safety, or our lives and liberties, as to leave us in the hands of our enemies,
or abase us in the eyes of Rebels, to lead us, or suffer us to be led into
temporal or spiritual captivity: Let us think always, he cannot forget
those rebellious persons which have fought several times against him; nor yet
the many attempts and practices which they have used against his Person,
Crown, Dignity, and the truth he professes, nor that God will suffer him to
sleep securely in the arms of such, as he knows watch only for opportunity
to destroy both Church and State, as also him and his: Our love to his Royal
Progeny must needs assure our love to him, and the hate of others to them,
assure their inward hate against him; and for such as persuade otherwise, that
our love to the King, or his children, and hate to the adverse Party, proceeds
either out of discontent, or a vain humor in us leading to disloyalty; let
their lies turn upon their own pates, and let evil happen to them that evil
think; there are subtle enemies which labor to breed jealousies betwixt him
and his Subjects, knowing it to be for their greatest advantage, and the only,
and chiefest plot to blemish and cloud the glory and magnificence of Monarchy,
they would alienate the heart of the King from his people, the people from the
King, and friends from each other; yet think, it cannot sink into his
Majesty's breast that such friends and servants, who have not only spent and
lost their estates, but hazarded their lives daily and hourly, should intend
the least hurt to him who is the defender of their faith; it is for Turks and
Heathens to become bloody Traitors, and it is for Tyrants to suspect their
friends: Good Princes who are Fathers of the Commonwealth, cannot nor will not
do thus, whilst in themselves they see no cause of their subjects hate; it is
our enemies plot to stir up our heady and hasty humors, by pulling our quills,
and racking our Estates, and so by degrees draw us clean off from that former
affection we bore to our Sovereign; Let me tell you, Conscientia mill testes,
and for my part, I had rather go to heaven with a few, then to hell with a
multitude. His Majesty cannot but see the actions of the public enemy, as
well as we, and much better; and therefore though you suffer with him for a
while, yet be you quiet, that their intents and projects upon you may be
frustrate: Think now, the King is making his own Chronicle; and assure your
selves, that though he has some imperfection in his speech, yet he means
speedily with his pen, or at leastwise, he can answer all their Propositions
with a non placet, but what need I speak more? He that can answer so well,
will never so far contradict his own words with repugnant actions, as thereby
to race his Armies, to stain the honor he was borne unto, and which he has
made good and bettered hitherto, by high and mighty enterprises of act and
admonition against so many perfidious Members; but think therefore, that all
this time, he is acting his part in Insula Vectis, that he has a better game
to play, that he is working his master piece in the public market, and
trying his exact skill in King craft, with the Hogle Mogle Parliament of
England, and the Grand Committee of Lords and Commons: The Lion may awake,
break loose, and tear his Keepers or else lead, whilst he seems to be ledd,
and then the world shall see, that neither the opinion of his sincerity in the
truth, nor of his unmatchlesse wisdom and policy, were vain mistakings, and
at last our David find a means to overthrow these crafty Achitophels; then
the Church shall triumph, and be comforted, the Commonwealth flourish, his
honor shall be eternized; neither shall you repent of your patience, or of
your sufferings, nor I of my pains or persuasions to this end, wherein I rest
satisfied with an assurance of his Majesty's favorable eye toward all his
loving subjects, as also Gods gracious mercies herein, and that we shall see
our desire upon our enemies, which is a condign punishment upon those who have
assisted Rebels against so loving and gracious a Prince.

To the loyal Inhabitants of the Isle of Wight.
The distance of places are not so far, but that you may easily hear and
perceive the divisions which are amongst us; for since the Kings departure, the
Parliament men are ready to run besides themselves, as also when it was night
there was no small stir among the Soldiers, what was become of Peter, since
it was veryfied that an Angel of the Lord has delivered him out of the hands
of these Herod's (who the next day thought to have killed him) and has sent him
unto you: I shall entreat you loving Countrymen, not to be astonished or
amassed, but entertain him as a loving and gracious Prince, observe his
commands punctually, you have time by the foretop, make use of it, for in the
end you will find it chronicled, and your eye shall see it, your everlasting
praise: Religion has taken a seven years voyage, and we hope may happily
arive at one of your Ports; the Rebels here, go on presumptuously in their
constant course, in taking part with the Serpent against the seed of the Woman;
and still desire to be known fierce persecutors of all true hearted
Royallists: Liberty of life they have voted only to themselves, and through
the great title of a Parliament, think to prescribe Laws to all Christendom;
no man that does evil, can ever hope to hear well from any but cowards or
flatterers; and for those they have enough, witness the innumerable Committee
men, and those honorable Gentlemen belonging to the Excise: I never think
upon these Caterpillars and Locusts, but they stir up a sad humor, sighs
from my very heart, and tears from my eyes for the destruction they are like
suddenly to bring upon this Kingdom, unless the Lord (out of his great mercy)
sends us a strong Easterly wind and blow them to Tyburne. I have read a story
of a Lion, who seemingly slept securely in his Den whilst the Hunters were
pitching coyles round about him; a Pismire perceived the danger, and stung the
Lion to awake him, with Tandem resurges, he futiously start up, and would
wreake his anger upon the presumptuous Pismire; to whom the Pismire cried, My
Lord, first look about you; he did so, and espying the snares of the Hunters,
escaped them: I leave the Reader to make application. O abominable Treason, is
this the way to make him a glorious King: O Lord incline not my heart to any
evil thing, to practice wicked works with men that work iniquity, especially
against the Lords Anointed; the Lord I hope will keep him from all the snares
which they have privily laid for him: Let the wicked fall into their own
nets, whilst (he being guiltless) shall escape: save Lord, let the King of
Kings here us when we call, and let all good people say, Amen.
