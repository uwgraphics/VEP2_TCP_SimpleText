TO THE HONORABLE, THE Knights, Citizens and Burgesses, in Parliament
Assembled.
IT is now almost seven years since I endeavored to set right his Majesty's
Revenue of Excise, both as to the Management of, and Accompting for it; but
hitherto have met with many obstructions, which almost discouraged me from ever
meddling any further in it: But having observed in his Majesty's most Gracious
Speech to both Houses of Parliament, at the opening of this Session, that his
Majesty takes notice that the Funds already established are deficient some
Millions, I am induced to offer to this Honorable House to discover some
hundred thousands of Pounds paid by the Subject for Excise of Beer and Ale,
which are diverted from their proper Chanel, into private Pockets; And if I
shall be required thereunto, and Encouraged by this Honorable House, I will
show by whom, and upon what Pretense these Sums are so diverted, and are still
like to be, if proper means be not applied; which I think my Duty at such an
Exigency of Affairs humbly to propose to this Honorable House, having been
Employed in the Excise, not only as a Sub-Commissioner, but also spent many
years study as well as Considerable Sums of Money in the improvement of that
Revenue.

The Consideration of this is humbly submitted to this Honorable House, by
John Farthing, late of Long Ditton in the County of Surrey, now of Chelsey in
the County of Middlesex. Subscribed,

John Farthing.
