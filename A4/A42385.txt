trust there Souls with. The Strafford of that Kingdom, and the Alexander of
the world, but neither of them did such miracles as incomparable Montros. who
can only be, by himself outdone; I am strongly of there opinion, that
persuade the King to remove him.

I would presume to advise the same. only I would assign the place, whither:

them with the Hog, wallowing in the Mire.

They teach preposterous and false Doctrine, that say Rebels will, be tamde
by yielding. with which Caesaer was unacquainted. I do not think it treason
to say. I would see King Charles aut Caesar ant nihil. I wish him a larger
Empire. I would see him act over the Black Prince, and far ont do him. some
thing that might cancel The Acts, and deface the Monument, of preceding Ages
at which Posterity, showlde gaze with wonder. He is ^ot inferior to any in
Dignities and Ex^ellencies. and I covet to see him supe^ior to the whole world
in Glories. Greater then Charles the Great, hap^ier then Charles the Good. I
would ^ot for a world (it should be the last thing in the world I would see)
his high and just designs disappointed pretenses, and coulorable Treacheries

Truth is I am Mad. ^s I live and Breathe Mad: It Is not op^ression, that makes
the wise Man mad which puts my thoughts into this Distraction. I am a Fool; yet
to be preferred to a Knave. too much knowledge of there damnable Defignes and
Traitorous practices in Scotland, makes me thus wildly deliver my mind in
Holland, and discover the naked truth to the whole world, in sheets.

My Fears, least that son of Goodness the inheritor of all his Glorious
Fathers Excellencies the now King, should give to much Credit to those
persuasions and Counsels, that would call on and hasten his Ruin and undoing.

Such fears disturb me. My zeal to his service, and my knowledge of there
horridand dangerous subtilles transport me: knowledge of crimes laesae
Maiestatis cause in me loesum Cerebrum.

And my brains are crackte insteade of there Necks.

I showld grow Calm on a sudden, did I see this cloud that hangs over the
Kings head dispelde, and those Evil Counselors removed, that portend a
storm, and prognosticate foul weather, how fair so ever they seem, to
pretend. Reader farewell! farewell for good and all. I cannot expecte to live
above a mouhe having spoken so much truth, unless I lie in; and Gallants hott
in the distempers of there bloods, have a ^ust excuse the spring after the
fall. I shall not keep my Chamber, not that I would not be found, but Toms,
run out of there wits, have ever the perpetual motion, and there extravigant

the noble hand of a Loyal Pretender, then suffer an unluckie Death by the
common and rude hand of a Rebel Trooper in a Crowd, that I shall not know to
whom to owe the Favor of my Death. The Kings Glorious Martyrdom has made me
ambitious of suffering. the Murdering of him makes me in love with Death.
when I see ye deadly heart, I shall imagine it Cupids, fall in love with Death
and court it as my Mistress.

I cannot live, and lie fallow. if I lie fallow, I am dead when I produce no
fruits of my obedience. Till my sword shall be rendered useful, I must employ
my penknife, my Blade at the best, can strike but a single Rebel, at one blow

bequeathe all his Majesty's subjects. Loyalty for a Legacy.

R. G.

IN this exigencie of time and pressure of affairs when a general sadness, and
Kind of despair oreclouds and shaddows the face of things, as well as Men. I
know nothing so necessarily conducing to his Majesty's concernments as
information; which must not come lamely creeping forth, as if it were affrayde
^o view the light or be seen by any and unawares be disco^ered, but appear
in bold, naked, and justifiable Truths! the King is in no condition to be
flattered, when he is in so great (...) hazard, and visible danger of being
beetrayde, and by com^ination of those factions who gave that fatal and cursed
^owe to his Glorious Father, of ever belssed memory. And ^resentlie threaten
appairent ruin to his Royal Posterity.

Without Counsel no high undertaking can be succefull, or attain to its
wished period. Without information ^ounsell is at a stand, and fixes the
Pillars of Hercules, be ^re we have performed the least of his labors. The
end of ^ounsell is action, execution. The end of this designed action (...)
restore the King: before the King can settle and establish (...) Throne he
must settle and confirm his Counsel. Which ^hile it continues in this unhappy
distraction, his wavering ^^d unfixt resolutions will be so divided, that he
shall but (...) certainly know, to which, with best advantages he should
^^line when Faction, professing the same ends, with the Royal party labors in
there pursuit to arrive at them by other, and most indirect means, and by the
way endeavor to exclude them. I shall communicate freely, what either the
undoubted information of others, or my own apprehension, and certain
knowledge has suggested to my sense and judgment. And since most men are
ledd, and seduced by opinion, let every one, [it is an uncontrolable liberty
that all men will take] frame what Arguments and censure he pleases, from what
he finds most faithfully asserted.

I hold myself obliged to the whole world to render a du^ and stricte account
of my observation and knowledge and wi^ entirely endeavor to vindicate truth
so excellinglie precious and absolutely to rectify, misinformed and erring
judgments I shall do it with such impartialitie and so sincerely, tha^ nota
Person living, of what faction soever, whithersoever hi^ particular interests
and Relations lead him, will be able t^ disprove.

There are diverse papers exhibited to the world in prin^ which, because they
are obuious to every common eye, purposely omit. They discover the manifold
Practices and A^tempts of the Hamiltons, for the obtaining of the Crown^ and
Government of the Kingdom of Scotland, at which the have aimed, more then one
hundred and twenty years, in constant proseqution of there disloyal designs.

If we examine seriously the whole tracte of the Dukes life and reflect on
the series of all his actions, we shall discov^ no less design of usurpation,
and fiery ambition of rule, in hi^ then in his Predecessors. Encouraged by
several Prediction and Astrologies, to which that Family is much addicted.
shall beeginne with, but not insist on his desires to the King (...) Sweden,
for his assistance to his unjust pretense: to who^ David Ramsey was sent a
Commissioner, who imagining h^ Master already King, and himself his
Ambassador, stood n^ upon bare ceremonies, but readily putt on his hatt, in
the presence of the King.

The most material things worthy our observation and strict survey, are the
Dukes Actions and deportments, after the pu^lishing of Mr Meldrumes scandalous
and traitorous book; which declaring him to have the only just right to the
crown of Scotland, cherished in him such an insatiate and implacable ^mbition
of Reign, that death only was able to extinguish ^he one, with the other.
The book was burned by the Hang^an, but the Author was entertained by the
Duke, and relea^ed, after three years imprisonment in the fleet,
notwith^anding the base aspersions of so inglorious a libeller.

Touching the Dukes next design, I refer the Reader to ^he depositions of
the Lord The, Lord Ocholtrie, Mayor ^arstwike with diverse others, extant upon
Record, and sin^^ published in Printe.

His pretexte of Leavies for Germany. A 1630. was only a ^lott to get power
into his hands, that having men in a rea^ines on foot, and well appointed, he
might, supresse the ^ing and Kingdoms by that power, joined with his factions
(...) either Kingdoms. The King, the people, all men in such ^rofound
security, not suspecting the hidden and concealed, ^anger, were not able to
make the least considerable resi^ance.

The Duke had resolved to launch out into the deep, and ^^ter two days
sailing to return to Hull, plant a garrison ^^d leave a Governor, while he
showld march to London, ^yne with his faction, imprison the King in the Tower.
And ^ere dispatche him by poison, send the Queen to France ^rowne himself
King of Scotland, declared to be Prote^or of the young King.

The Islande of Orcades were offered to the Lord The, ha^ng a Regiment of
fiveteene hundred men, to join in the ^esigne.

To this end the Duke procured twelve or ^^^^teene thousand Arms, to be
disposed pri^^^elie in sev^ral places of his interests, and caused diverse
pieces of Cannon to be cast, by his Cosen Alex: Hamilton in that Kingdom,

He pressed tbe king to al Monopolies, of which himself had the greatest
share. And yett had his emissaries to poison the people against them, and to
murmurre and cry out agayust the king in both kingdoms.

He importuned the king to call Parliaments and then urged reasons to dissolve
them, thus be brought the king into hatred, and incited the people to
commotions. While he always studdied to send al persons, from Court
malcontente He ordinarily reviled the king, and where he had freedom tovent
his expressions, had him in hate and derision.

When he was Deputed Commissioner for Scotland, he had particular warrant to
limitt and regulate Episcopacie, or pass from it altogether, as might best
conduce for peace; the king justly fearing, that the troubles and stirrs in
Scotland if not quieted and appeasde on any terms would breed unrest in
England; and put his discontented subjects into a combustion at home, yett he
deserted the Assembly, suffering them to sit, abando^ed the Government, took
with him all Officers of^ State and purposlie let the Reins of Government
loose that ye people might have ye easier liberty to rebel. He told the
king, that if he did not cut of those Rebels he did not deserve to reign,
The king had done well to have beegunne with him yet double Toungde he
whispers to the people, the^ king was a Coward; the innocent death and unjust
suffering of the King the guilt and deserved punnishment of the ^^ke speaks
who appeared the cowart on the Scaffold, he advised them to hold the king
strictly to it, and not to depart from there unreasonable demands. Telling
them if they gave him his will, he would prove a Greater tyrant then Ne^ro;
when he was first employed with a fleet into the Scotsh Sease, he might have
either hindered them from coming to ^nntzlawe or, if he had landed in the North
of that Kingdom, as he was often solicited, by the kings friends he might
^here have brought twenty thousand men on there backs, as is most notoriously
known: but having five or six thousand men (...) boarde, he never made the
least attempt.

While he was in the fleet, he had private meetings every ^ther day, and
conference with the chief of the Rebels com^ittee, discovered to them all the
kings designs and provided, ^emedies against them, and either approved there
counsels, ^r put them upon new proiects all his friends of greatest intima^ie,
and nearest relation to him, who were never accustomed (...) desert him in the
most unjust designs imaginable, were the ^nely mortal and most malicious
enemies against the, king and ^emed in that only, to appear against him, his
people, his ^angers on did ordinarily drink healthes to king James the ^venthe
and he did tacitly allow, and countenance it at ^^ch times as he lay in the
Kings Bedchamber, he frequently ^^ed to search his Majesty's pocketts for
letters, sent the dup^ates to the rebels, by which intelligence, the Kings
friends ^^re disappointed of there intentions to do him service he so ^^btily
insinuated with the king [hee could pick thanks as ^ell as pocketts] as he
prevailed for a Commission to go ^^o Scotland, with a coulorable pretense, to
settle and com^^se there differences: he referred all to the determination
(...) a National Synod at Glascow, which he soon dissolved, ^^d returning to

to himself purchased the ^^mmand of the Navy, he came to the Forth of Scotland
but ^^eatned by the Covenantars, who sent some to the ships to (...) him know
that if he did prejudice them, they would discover all, and prove against him
the Accusations of my Lord The and Ocholtrie, he desisted from enterprising
any thing, conducing to the kings service, unless the munity he enforced on
his soldiers, aduantaged it, a pacification was made beetweene the king and
his Subjects of Scotland who the insueing year invaded England. The Duke held
correspondence with the chiefest Covenanters.

He persuaded the king to pass an act for the Triennial Parliament; and more
to eternize that, while it was not to be dissolved without there own consent.

Anno, 1641. At the kings goeing into Scotland, the Duke to ingratiate himself
with the people joined with ye Marquisse of Arguille in that faction, with
whom, he deserting the Parliament at Edinburg, retired into the Country,
pretending a plott against him by some Courtiers and Soldiers. At which time
the king publikly declared in Parliament, that the Duke was the only man, had
incensed him against the kingdom, how ever he seemed now to comply with them.

When he was his Majesty's commissioner he often said in private, to the
chief Covenanters, that nothing would prevail with the king but force, and
necessity. When the Earl of Traquaire being Commissioner in Scotland, did
return to London, he concealed him ten days in his Bedchamber, gave no
occount of his trust to the king, till they had resolved on a bitter relation
against the Scots, which compelled the king to declare a war, which done, he
sent them informations, advertissements, helps and assistances to state them
in a condition, of defense.

He did subtlie weave himself into the Command of the Navy the second time,
he provides it with a vast expense* pretends (as he knew well to dissemble,
though unfit for Reign) some easy discontents, causes all the Ships to be
unvictual'd, the stalladges and other necessary accomodations for horse and
foot to be demolished, within ten days following, he urged to have his
charge renewed, (...) to be reuictuald he brings a saucy bill of Fare; the
(...) charge the account, upon his one score, the ships upon the Dukes, to
which, being chief of his cabbinet Counsel, he had persuaded him in a very
short time. Thus are the Kings Treasures unnecessarilie exhausted, and time
allotted to the rebels in Scotland to advance in there undertakings.

When the king had made a prosperous progres in his affairs and had very near
subdued all his opposers in England, when ^ee had reduced the whole Kingdom to
his obedience except London, and three or four other Garrisons, and those few
Members who styled themselves a Parliament had no visible means left to
preserve themselves, or oppose the King, but the ^uiting in of the Scots, when
it was if not possible, at least ^ery difficult, for the Covenanters to afford,
or contribute any considerable assistance to there confederates in England, if
those who protested themselves the kings friends in Scotland ^ad faithfully
acted there Parts; then Hamilton thought it ^ighe time for him to passover
from the Covenanters, and ^retend for the king that having free access to his
Counsels, ^e might at pleasure betray, and disappointe his designs ^^hen the
incomparably noble Marquis of Montros had at ^orke informed the Queen, of the
Scots conspiracy, and ^ad fully represented to her Majesty, the treacheries
and ^mminent danger of the Covenanters, had unripped there ^olicies and
unmasked all there devices, when he advised (...) mature prevention, and by
anticipating there designs, to ^pell force with force. to which more then a
bare lawfulnes, (...) in evitable necessity did urge. The Duke posted with
more ^ast then good speed to York, with a coulor to kiss her Ma^sties hands
and congratulate her safe arivall into England. ^om whence he had formerly
designed to send her on an Embassy: but his plot was entirely to overthrow and
confound the seasonable and faithful counsels and persuasions of that truly
perfectly Loyal Soul, that Man of Honor the Marquis of Montros, he
possessed the Queen how raw, indisgested, rash and Dangerous the counsels of
the Marquis were and altogether condemned his judgment and in that his own
which in all men's ought to be highly preferred to the Dukes Opinion, he did
more then put a remora, to retard, he gave check to the Marquisses high
undertakings and by subtle art and cunning, got the disposing of the Men and
the whole game iuto his own hands by which means after, he gave checkmate to
the King he offers by fair means to hinder the raising of an Army in Scotland,
if the too often deceived King would trust him with the managinge of that
buissnes, to rende (...) it more plausible, he promises to perform it,
without trouble or expense to his Majesty whose bags he had milkt before;
such easy proffers have ever a powrfull influence on princes reduced to want
and irresistible necessity, but his vile an^ cheap counsels, which he
always gave for naught cost the King dear by dissembling a danger, he had
contracted o^ himself from the Legislative Covenanters, and counterfeitin^ the
hazards he seemed to run, although he came not without there privitie and
allowance and abundantly furnished with there treacherous instructions, he
gained from the King a^^ absolute trust.

Returnde to Scotland, he made great Professions at hom^ as he had done
abroad and would have gladly seemed the most joyous, and most zealous person
living for the Kings in^terest, yet in all his proceedings, he crossed the
advices an^ resolutions of the Kings friends he betrayed the Kings tru^^ and
filled up the blanks committed to him, with the King^ approbations to that
Convention of Scotland, where a leavy o^^ twenty thousand, men for England, and
six thousand fo^^ ^reland were ordained. The King advertisde that the
Co^enanters had indicted a Convention of state without his con^^nt or knowledge
did write a letter to the Duke and those of ^^e counsel to discharge the
Convention, the Duke concea^ng the letter desired the Earl of Kallender to
confer with ^^e Earl of Roxbroug, and some others, best affected to his
^ajestie to ask there advise they all unammously concluded, ^^e King should
disclayme the Convention, and declare it ^^egall but the Duke, [who without the
Kings knowledge ^^d consent, and contrary to ye laws of the Kingdom
inter^^sing the Kings name and Authority, had invited, and com^lled the
Covenanting Lords to frequent Assemblies] ac^^aints them by the Earl of
Callander, that it was the Kings ^^tention and purpose, to approve the
Convention, with some ^^w restrictions, and limitations; this false suggestion
of the ^uke, made them to alter there advice the King never having ^rboured
such a thought until it was insinuated, to him by ^^milton as the advice of a
friend from Scotland, that there ^^ere probable conjectures and posible hopes,
to overpowre (...) Covenanters, And carry the matters in the Convention, (...)
the Kings advantage, or at least to impede and obstruct any ^^stance to be
sent into England against him. Thus the ^^ngs expectation, was deluded and the
hopes of his faithful ^bjects in Scotland frustrated, while both, were induced
by ^^e Dukes Policy to approve and countenance the Convention ^^d the Kings
affairs suffered an infinite prejudice when at that ^^me it was very feosible
to have suppressed there confederacy (...) its infancy or growing Estate, ere it
had aspirde to that ^^ighte and perfection, since Scotland wanted not, rather
a^unded with Men Loyal, trusty, and valiant, those men wan^^d neither power,
or those necessary accomodations for ^^rre, the sinews, the ligaments that
Causa sine qua non, ^oney, only the Kings Commission, by which they should
have power to act, was deficient with which once inspired, they would have
attempted any thing, might present danger, and administer any occasion to
express there honorable reguard to the Kings most inestimable life, and Royal
dignities. Delay (in affairs of great importance ever dangerous, and to be
avoided) could only destroy there hopeful designs then, a^ our just fears
are, it will do at present* there are too many sa^ witnesses of the Dukes and
his Brother the earl of Lannerick^ Deportments in that Convention, and
afterward; there Actions were in no wise answerable to there promises in there
conference with the Noble men that were well affected to the King, they refused
to join with them in a course of oppositi on, or to give there approbation,
that they should actuate without his Personal appearance in the buisines, these
that would have adventured there Fortunes, there lives, whatsoever wa^ Dear
unto them, for his Majesty's preservation were ignominiouslie betrayde.

When the Duke for his heinous Crimes and Treasonabl^ Practices, was justly
committed Prisoner to Pendennis Cast^ his Brother the Earl of Lannericke,
deserted his Majestie^ service at Oxford, and secretly conveyed himself away
having no excusable pretense, unless the Dukes deserved imprisonment can
justify his Defection from so Dear and Bounteou^ a Master, that to the Duke
had ever given more then he could deserve, and no more in this then what he
deserved. Lanne ricke preferrs the safety of a Brother to the preservation of
hi^ Countries Father, to save one, on whose being some particular Friends, and
Followers had dependence he leaves as much as in him lay, the King to the
mercy of his ennemies to be destroyed, in whose life and well being the
preservation and security of three Kingdoms did alone consist. He repaires
to London, joins himself to the Scotch Commissioners, for which he will
never be able to repair his weatherbeaten reputation and blasted honor. The
Commissioners welcome ^s revolte and congratulate his dishonorable retreat
from ^s Masters Cause and Service. They dispatche him away to ^ere Army, by
sea, with Letters of Commendations. From ^e Army he beetakes himself to
Scotland, where in a sol^^ne meeting in there Parliament, he not only
protested that ^e was penitent for his former carriage in adhering to the
^^ing, but that he would not have deserted his Master until ^s Master had
deserted God [well said thou good and ^thful servant] he declared publicly
that it he did see visiblie. (...) Religion destroyed, and the Mass openly
mantained and ^^ofessed both in the Army, and at Oxford [a zealous convert ^at
speaks more then the Truth,] he has no sooner given ^idence of his penitent
and Contrite heart, but they are mer^full to the Sinner, they receive him into
there honorable ^^cietie, and adorn him with the reverent title of a Cove^nter
[a holy and blessed order] Thus qualified, they admit ^^e sanctifide Brother,
to there Religious Counsels and on ^m immediately confer the command of
forces against the ^^ngs Majesty, which he like a grateful and Loyal
Subject ^ost thankfully receivesly how vigorous and stirring he proved (...)
all his undertakings with the Rebels, all men, that know ^^y thing of that
Kingdom perfectie know, he did show ^^ch rare feats of his Activitie, in
there Combination, that ^^th quick and nimble motion he skipps into the place
of a ^eading Member, he appeared like a Ruling Elder, nothing ^s done, or
indeed could be done, without him, at that ^eate Battle of Kilsythe where
six thousand Rebels were ^yne under the well managed Conduct of the Noble
Munt^s, he had drawn together one thousand foot, and five ^ndred Horse, of
his friends and Followers, which were on ^ere March within seven miles, to
have joined with the ^^bells not with standing all the entreaties, and
solicitations, persuasions, and promises Loyal Montros did use, to make him
join with him, in the Kings service, against which he stubbornly persisted,
and continued in Arms and opposition till Montros by the Kings express
commands, had disbanded his Forces [the Royal Party.]

When the King was at Newcastle, he was credibly informed, that upon a
serious consultation amongst the Covenanters, what instructions they should
send to the Scotch Commissioners residing at London, concerning the King who as
they said was the Author of so much bloushed, the Generous Earl of Lannericke
gave out these words:

We can never have Peace so long as this King or any of his Race remains. [A
worthy position] but we deny his Major and his mino^ and pray against his
Conclusion, touching the race of the King* an Argument he may chance to run
himself out of breath^ in! upon another occasion he delivered his mind in
these words.

We can have no difference of Monarchical Government all the Difference will
be, who shall be King. His scrupilous conscience needed not have raisde so
dangerous a doubt, it may be, he expects the accomplishment of his horoscope,
wherein (as himself since related, he had so great confidence) that when he
was thought to be in danger, before his Escape from Oxford he was heard to to
say.

He was sure he was not near his Death for it was promised him that before
he dyed he should be greater man, then was safe for him to mention. [Would
he be more then a Duke?] if his Ambition cannot ^^e satisfied with his
Brothers title, God send him his Place ^^o; he may be an Angel in heaven,
but must not a King upon Earth, unless he designs to rule some new
Plantation, the ^^d Britains prefer the Stewarts to the Hamiltons.

Some old wives in Scotland affirm that the Midwife at his ^^tivitie, out of
the strength of all inspird, did Prophecy most ^wrefully, and let some odd
and strange things drop from ^er, they say with all that he was an eminent
witch.

When the Duke was set at liberty from imprisonment and ^^e to London, he was
heard say.

Wherefore shonld he go to the King [then at ^ewcastele] how could he ever
trust that man who ^^en he was in power imprisond him. [I wonder he did not
do it sooner and that he had trusted (...) so long] this unhansome expression
discovered the re^^ment he had of his imprisonment. When he came to
Neu^astele, he and his Brother Lannericke, did undertake to the ^^ng, to carry
him into Scotland, which if they had performed ^^cording to promise it had
been very easy for ye king to have, ^^gaged that Kingdom, and there Army, for
restoring his Maje^^e to his just Rights in England. But his coming into
Scot^^d and there designs were incompatible. his presence there ^ould have to
much Ecclipsed there Greatness, and have clipte to ^ort the wings of there too
highe-soaring Ambition. they divert (...) from his resolutions, with fair
pretenses leading him along, (...) a strict Guarde was set upon his Person.
Within some few ^yes after he was delivered [being sold] to the Parliament
brokers the Parliament of Scotland they made a fair semblance of reasoning for
the King, had a pretty flourish, a skirmishing in words but when it came to the
pushe of a Vote conceruing his deliveri^ the two Brethren in iniquity were in
the Negative themselves but al there friends and dependants, whose voices they
used t^^ command with the same freedom, they did there own, were a^^together
in the Arffirmative for selling the King contrary to the aforsayde Brethrens
promise and asseurance to his Majesty. Tho^ greedy Merchants that so fierclie
voted for selling the King, we^^ as violent in there debates for making the
Duke General in ther^ late engagement, for when not only the lawfulnes, but
the unavoidable necessity of ingageing in a war against the Bre^^kers of
that Covenant, of ever cursed memory, with Englan^ was made manifestie to
appear and had received the stamp, an^ authority of the convened States.

Duke Hamilton by the contrivance of his accomplices and the connivence of is
competitors is Elected General. A Person (...) of the most eminent Titles, so
of the greatest Activitie and vigo^ amoungst them; he, having had the command
of an Army h^ retofore in Germany, and for some few other intricate Reason it
thought Fittest to command the present designed to go^ against the common
Ennemie, of the confederate Kingdome^ They proceed to levy men, which are
lifted with that unwilli^gnes, and so slowly, that they seem to be too heavy
a Burden for the Country, and the cause too light; whatsover is so spe^^ouslie
pretended by these new undertakers, it is suspected (...) most Men and beeleeved
by many, the Good and happy beei^^ of the King and his Royal Posterity is the
least in there intention^

This was the Reason, why this new Model of a cause met o^^struecion in the
house ad oppofition abroad the Dissentors (...) Parliament, having Abettor is
in the Assembly by whose Divi^^ assistance, they were more then encouraged.
for the Persoaha^ brought the Caul into suspicion and controversy.

In the most stricst examination, and disquirie of particular^ ^^ey found
Argument and Ground enough whereon to raise a ^^rre but the General they had
pitched upon, would not hold (...) watter; he had sprung a leake before, and
was not sound at ^^ttome.

Had the Affairs be managed under another conduct, the un^fulnes of the
engagement had not been imputed for sin. So ^^e was it judged from being
unjust, that by all sides it was con^^ to be inevitably necessaire. So much
acknowledged to be ^re D^ty, that Necglect would prove Perjury. They conclu^^
in a kind of Dilcmma, either take up Arms, or shake hands ^^h the Covenant and
part. Lay it altogether aside, or use the ^ost Endeavonrs to make it Good;
stand to it now, or let it (...) for ever. cowld the Duke in there opinion
have been as ea^^ cleared as there other Doubts, the Church in all men's opi^^n
had undoubtedlie gone along for Company. And those ^^pits which were fraught
with most bitter invectives, had been ^ull of exhortations and motives. Large
promises of Blessings (...) been the snbject of Sermons, that now abounded
with revi^^s and bitter curses Yett I wonder not to hear him called mad ^^gge to
his Theethe, out of the Pulpitte at Edinburg, when no^^ was so sold as his own
Chaplayne at Hamilton in his presence ^^urse the engagement and damn al such
as showld prosecute it, (...) do I wonder at his impudence, when I know others
the ^^ke had sent to, to exclaim and inueigh against ye unlawful en^^ement.
Who out of conscientiousnes refusing were suddenly ^^cke dumme. Silenced by ye
Assembly.

All the use they made, of Preaching, was first exprobation to (...) Duke, and
Commination to the People. Which he him^^ hears with that wonderful
Patience, that he seems ra^^ pleased with the Doctrine then offended with the
Applica^^: that not one of them was ever in Q^estion; calls the Hearers
Q^estion, and might putt it out of doubt, they were conscious that they had
heard an Ordinance is provided to stop there mouths, which they open theu
vider to there very faces The Duke takes notes, but no notice of there Sermons,
being very confident, as he often affirmed, all they cowld vent in those
places, would not suffice, to prevent his Designs, which i^ the unhappy event
proved too trve. Yet by this A^t by this cunning of preaching the Levies are
almost every where retarded in the West they rise to oppose them. the
insurrection is brough^ soneere the Dukes own Gates, that wise men imagined,
it wa^ contrived within, for his own Vassals were as buisie as the best^ And
the chief Actors and Leaders of the R^bellion, were left a^ liberty to sit
down, till the dispersing of the first, and the Gathering together of the
second Levy might administer a fresh occasion to manifest whose children they
were.

If the Dukes design was to ruin the well Affected to the King and the Royal
Party as it was rationalie conj^ctured, then i^ very much did conduce to his
purpose, to preserve so necessary instruments for perfecting the Work where
he had laid (...) most strong foundation.

He had soon discovered of what excellent use they would prove in due time,
that had already supdlyde him with a hansome excuse that his motion to the
assistance of the Royal Party i^ England might not be censured slow, and the
delay, to which se^emed inforete, receive some color to justify the reoson,
though the insurrection it lelfe had none.

Before that time, there Deportment to the English had received a scurvy
construction. Little were they beholding to them for the advancing of there
Affairs, when all arts and industry was used to hold them back. there
diligence and utmost Powers would have been employed to the advantage of there
undertakings, had the Duke simply espoused a Quarrel for the King, and not a
Quarrel against him, for one of his Kingdoms to which that an easyer way, and
not so open, may be found it is thought expedient to destroy first his Majesty's
known Faithful, Friends in England those fir^^e Pillars once removed, the
Royal Palace must fall, being ^o longer supported. whose ruin that it might
be certain, ^^nd unsuspected, Prerogative must receive its fatal wound
through the sides of a pretended Loyalty.

Sir Marmaduke Langdale is treated with. A Person whose ^ndoubted integrity,
and perfect courage had so powrfull in^uence on his Majesty's Party, that from
all parts he was able ^o draw forces to his Assistance. He is permitted to
take ^erwicke and Carlisle and pntt in Garrisons, but upon this ^ondition, that
they be surrendered into the Dukes possession, (...) soon as he showld enter
into England, with his Army. As ^laces to retreat to, showld his Army be
beaten. If he had ^estined them to that end before, it was a subtle plot to
dis^ossess the Kings friends, and secure those Towns in the ^ands of his
professed Ennemies. It cowld not be expected, ^^e Army once vanquished those
Garrisons would hold out long, ^onsisting all of Officers and Soldiers at the
Dukes Devotion.

Sir Marmaduke Landale had purchased so great a reputa^on, by the surprise of
Berwike and Carlisle that his forces are ^ery much increased, by a confluxe of
people from those ^diacent parts. Men are not wanting to him so much as Arms,
^f which he stood much in need yett every one had his Breast ^rmed with
resolution and Loyalty, not intending to turn ^ere backs on the rebellions
ennemy.

Messingers are dispatched to the Duke to desire a supply ^f Arms, tustie
expecting a readiness in them to further and ^romote there enterprise, from
whom they had received en^ouragement to attempt it.

Although there necessity, and the great consequence is ^ade to appear,
there is little show of compliance while ^ere demands are unsatisfied, by much
solicitation and im^ortunitie, five hundred Arms to Berwicke, and three
hundred to Carlisle are privatelie conveyed. For the Duke will not be s^en to
allow or countenance there procedings albeeit the beeginnings were warranted
with promises of his Graces assistance. Which being at any time implorde, was
at no time so ready as an excuse. And that backte with reasons to color the
ne^glect. A further supply of Arms is required, and promise made to restore
them so soon as there Soldiers showld march to the Borders. Protestation is
made they have them not. Some Arms there are of the old Generals but they will
not make bold, to handle them without his leave, which, I know not if they
ever askte. So little i^ he there friend, whom they feared to make there
ennemie* that those Arms are reserved for there destruction which prob^^bly
might have proved there preservation. They choose rather to prejudice there
certain friends, then hazard the offending of one, at that time doubtful, but
after there declare^ ennemie. This not granted, they are desired to furnish
them with so much money, for the present occasion, and they would take care to
provide Arms, there being then Good store i^ Leithe and for caution, they
would make choice of wha^ Notherne Gentlemen, they pleased to secure themselves.

They had met so many occasions to disburse large sums* that Money was the
hardest commodite to come by. Thi^ slender excuse serving for a denial, no more
is insisted on, bu^ that they would procure them credit with the Merchants, and
they would drive the bargain, make the best marquett they cowld. But this
demand also is supposed to be so unreasonable that it is not assented to, and
it was thought as strang^ that proposals to aduantagious showld meet so cold
an entertainment. But it is no wonder if duly considered; for ad^mitt the
restoring of the King to be the sole object of ther^ purposes, then would the
English forces share too much in the ^lory of the Action, and rob the Duke of
the honor due ^^ohis Name. Suppose sinister and worse ends, then would those
forces with there daily Accruits, if tymouslie supplyde, ^ave grown to that
greatness and strength, it would not have ^eene in the Power of the Duke or the
adverse Army, to who ^^e they seemed to be destineda prey, to have gainde so
easy a ^onquest. Notwithstanding the no help he receives.

Sir Marmaduke advances into the Country swells into a ^ody of four or five
thousand horse and foot; he mar^eth forward, meets an open Ennemy and a
secret order ^ot to figh. In obedience to this order he rerreats. The ^nnemie
pursves; he forbidden to fight, secures his forces in Carlisle; Lambert sitts
down before it.

Sir Marmaduke, blocked up on one side of the Town is re^uced to an
unnecessarie necessity, a needles extremity. He ends away to aquainte the
Duke in what a posture his affairs ^ood, his Grace little sensible of the
inconveniences would ^nsuer, etournes but an unsatisfactorie answer.

Sr Marmadukes wants admit of no delay, nor will they ^uffer him to be in
jest. Doubtful of the Dukes intendments (...) come, and desirous ot know
certainly, what he was to ^xpectt and trust to, dispatches a Gentleman to
reneuw his for^er solicitations and inform him preciselie of there real ^^d
insupportable condition. And importune his sudden ad^ance.

Colonel Lockher is sent before with twelve hundred ^orse to visitt the
Borders, but the Plague was, he has no ^rder to releevi the distressed.
Otherwise they might have, in ^l probalitie, performed that, in an instant, a
long time ^ould not serve to undo eespeciallie if they had at the same ty^e
spared Collonell Gray five hundred or a thousand horse, which were in a
readiness. And for which he offered pro^ortionable pay to go into
Northumberland, of which he had been undoubtedly absolutie Master. And had
endangered the enemies Garrison in Newcastle which they had resolved to
surrender and of which ye Duke was informed. A part of the Army is not
vvorth the hazarding, one blow shall suffice to cut of the whole.

The Duke is now at length on foot, he takes Carlisle into the Arms of his
protection; Marches forward, goes, as if he had been beewitcht into
Lanchashire, and without performing any, the least considerable thing, his
mighty, and all threatening Army is totaly routed, we defeated of our
expectation, and the travail, the hard labor of so many months destroyed in
a moment. a strange Catastrophe, this sudden execution made very many
beeleeue they had received there doom long before, that the Ennemy might
give the easier, and an irrecouerable overthrow order was taken to disperse
them to there hand, the Rear of the Army being distant from the Van, more
then forty miles; good miles but bad ways and there I leave his Grace, where
he left his Army to be disbanded after a strange new, mode, of which there is
nothing left, but the sad remembrance.

No sooner had the welcome news of the Armies defeate^ arrived in the West,
but they rise in Arms being in a readiness before and expecting this blessed
opportunity. The^ Brethren in Fife had more Prophetike Spirits who wrote
diverse Epistles wherein they made mention of the very Tyme^ and so preciselie
related particular accidents, is if they had consulted before with the Duke or
the Devil.

The Rebels in the west have slain some of the intended second levy in there
own Country, and being fleshte the blood hoauds hunt for prey abroad. they
advance and threaten Edinbourough. The standing Committee, is running out of
there wits, thy advise what way is best to take. They agree, they will not
longer prosequute the late engagement, ^ut resolve the endeavoring to preserve
and secure there ^wne Persons, by joining those small forces they have to ^ose
newly returnde from England. there old Secretary is ^osen there new General:
the same hand directs the Pen, ^d the Sword sing the second part to the same
tune the good ^ukes brother is about to perfect what himself had leftun^one.

Scarce vvarme in his but yesterday Title, he hastens to ^s command! the
design must not cool. Before he secu^s the Town, he takes possession of
the Fei^de. The Castle (...) left in the hands of an Ennemie to keep out
friends that ^ight as easily have been committed to the safe custody of
friend, that would have kept the ennemie at a greater ^stance.

He takes along with him the Earl of Glenkerne. The Lord Lynsey by
usurpation Craford stays beehinde to pro^de Arms formy Lord Mourtons
Regiment. But being ^easurer and carryng the bag not keeper of the Castle,
he ^ew better how to lay up, theu to distribute. he stays not ^ng, for the
destroying ennemie approaching, he flies like ^icodemus to seek a savior by
night, and at Heddington ^eets the other desciples, who were thither fled, not
for ^e testimony of a Good conscience, and here they lay the ^undation for
there intended vvare. But the General wants ^en, those men he has want
Arms. We have a certain ^nde of treasurer, and he wants money, which
would have ^ene much more acceptable to the soldier then his per^n.

They send letters to recall General Majior Munro out of ^ngland, who being
left beehinde to guarde the Cannon, his ^rees were preserved entire, when the
Army disjointed fell ^to pieces.

The Triumuirate, L. Lannerike, Lynsey and Glenkerne, march toward the
borders, to unite with some scattered Tropes, that had escaped the ennemy and
were come into Scotland. They meet at a Rendevous, join, and March to Dunce.

The Lord Honby, and the Lord Lee, come with overtures for a Treaty with the
Chancellor then in Arms about Edenbourg. They embrace the offer; send back
there proposals, which if the ennemy condescend to, they will prosequute the
treaty wherein they hope to retoncile there private differences, and with an
unanimous consent oppose Cromwell that bore intestine hatred to there Nation.
And so happily recover there lost honor. This is made the ground, and pretense
for a treaty.

Yett we were not ignorant that Letters were intercepted in there passage to
Lambert; wherein he had order to hazard fighting with Sir Marmaduke Langdale on
any terms, that if possibly, he might join with them in the West of Scotland
with whom they held correspondence, and where himself was daily with his
forces, expected. it is a wonder to simple honesty, that rational men (for such
showld men of those eminent places be) cowld imagine, that the westland people
would combine with there ennemies, to repel there friends, whom they had long
before invited, and were now ready to entertain.

Of there inclinations to the one faction, and of there hate and aversion to
the other this there second insurrection, had given a sufficient testimony.

What expectation, what asseurance cowld be had of those people now, that in
the Pride and glory of a puissant Army durst with a few oppose, and dispute the
unlawfulnes of the engagement; would they allow that for lawful now, when
there are as few to withstand them strong, at least in there own opinion, both
in number and Power.

Nor were we ignorant of the great disadvantage the delay of treating would
bring upon our selves. And of what excellent ^se it would be to our
Adversaries, which they wisely taking unto there consideration, demand there
may be a cessation for ^^veteene days, in which time they would endeavor to
compose the discords then beetweene them, which they desired rather, and
intended showld be continued David Lesley thought ^^veteen days enough to
putt his undisciplinde Mutineers into (...) warlike Posture, and about that
time, as after he did Crom^ell would come to there assistance. There demands
are thought ^oo hard, and unreasonable, to yeele to, Lynsey is appointed to ^o
and meet with M. G. Munro. to invite him, to his own loss ^ojoyne with us. To
which he is readily persuaded, being ^imselfe a Person of much Gallantry,
he was confident they ^ent upon the same principles of honor that he did,
nor did ^eesuspect any thing, but the Kings interest, to be the object of ^ere
be gunne quarrel, and this continued controversy. Our ^ords like the Devil
having compassed the earth return to ^eddington, where G. M. Munro. in a noble
compliance with there ^esires, gives them a faithful asseurance of his utmost
powers.

At that instante Sir Iaruis Lucas, and Colonel Chater two En^lish Gentlemen
of known Loyalty and trust, are sent from the ^^maining forces in England
under the command of Sr Thomas ^^insley with offer of there aid and
assistance, to the proseqution (...) the war wherein they were first engaged
mutualie; and al^ough two or three thousand men were not at such a time
in^nsiderable, they are rejected, and return with a bare, a thred^re
compliment, They camot come, they may not enter into ^e holy land, [Scotland is
Canaan] without the Covenant ^ere mouths are stopped, but before they face
about. they are ^ld to ask a certain question or two.

First, if, that in case, Cromwell showld press so upon ^em, they were no^ able
to keep footing in there own Coun^y, they would give them leave to come upon
Scotch Ground ^eerly for there own preservation.

By no means my Lord Lannericke cannot allow that in consistencie with his
designs. that will call in Cromwell, wh^ under a color of pursuing them,
will with a greater an^ more considerable number, join with the Ennemy to there
in^finite prejudice, which to avoyde, they are advised to dis^band, when they
are no longer in a possibility of making good there own Country. which
nevertheles did not divert Cromwell from his Design and long purpose of coming
into Scotland, but only which was enough, weaken and destroy the Kings Party
in England thus private Policy undermines, and Easily ruins a strength, that
being once joined to them, the public Ennemy would have encountered a
difficulty before there overthrowe: counsel seconded with seeming reason.
pust a fatal and final end, to that force, would have begun a new work, that
might have met a revolution, sooner th^n a period.

The officers and other Gentlemen obtain a liberty to secure themselves in
Berwicke, under protection of there Garrison, but had not most of them provided
better for there own safety, they had been secured with those that adventured
a stay, in a Prison. yet was it desperately sworn, they would hazard all
there Fortunes the last drop of there bloods, in the defense and just
preservation of those Gallant men that had so freely laid there fortunes,
there lives at stake in joining with them. yet Barwicke is not only
surrendered, but those Gentlemen, of whom there is no mention in the
capitalation, are given up a sacrifice to there cruel Ennemy. and with the
Town, as if that were too little, they resign up the preceding Governor, out
of whose Custody they had taken it formerlie, it seems, and may be presumed,
on purpose to put it into those hands.

Now is the L. Lamericke joined to G. M. Munro there united forces discover a
hansome Body, only the L. Glenkerne is in doubt, what face to put on it. Here
is an Army ^^le to justify the cause, but the cause in it self does not
ap^eare to be just and so not justify them. (they told not this to ^unro
before) when in there letters to him they had coniured ^^m by his loyalty to
combine with them, and svvorn to him, (...) prosecute the late engagement
while there veins contei^ed the least drop of blood. notvvithstanding. there
private ^greement at a Commit to desert it) a tender conscience; ^tisfaction
must be given. it was thought just, even by these ^ersons, and requisite to
suppress them when they did rise before in the West and is not it equalie just
to destroy them, ^ovv, that made so ill use of there former Mercy.

The Persons are the same only more in number, the cause ^f there Rebellion is
the same, only it is not the same Re^ellion. it is another, but to the same tune,
the second Re^ellion for the first cause. was the engagement at first lavv^ll,
and is it unlawful to pursue it.

The engagement is not less lavvfull, but we are less able, so ^ore unwilling
to continue in it, to make it good. The Duke ^vanquisht, gone to the Dogs, and
who knovvs what will ^ecome of poor Lannericke and us? The Duke is down the
^inde, and Lannericke will but swime against the stream. (...) Yet if the
refractorie Ennemy condescend not to there de^ands, which only tended to there
own preservation, it is ^estionles most lawful to engage the poor, deceived
Soul^er to fight it out to the last man. The proposals are rejected ^e word and
sign are given, we advance, and approache the ^nemy with such boldness, as if
we resolved, either certaine^ to beat and conquer the foe, or at least to
make sure of the ^ippe, then in Leithe Road, that was sent with Arms from ^e
Princes highness to the L. Lynsy and L. Lannericke, which ^d been no ill
service, considering my L. Mourtons Regi^ent consisting of about a thousand men
were quartered within ten miles of us, and stayde beehinde us for want of
Arms. A Commanded Party is sent out, which about Musslebourough rancunters a
Porty of ye Enemies horse, who being so uery lately borrowed from the Plow,
were as unacquainted with this new trade as there raw Ryders, they draw
back, and both make use of there heels, and in there flight leave about ten,
beehinde them, which being dead, weight, were too heavy to carry and there they
gave the first proof how they meante (not) to fight.

The whole Body of our Horse advances to Musslebourough the sands by r^ason of
the sea were not then passible. we march^ to the Bredge, where we maks a halt,
and in a cecem^ny give the^ foot the way to march before us. while we are
sent to seek out new adventures, to find a pass, and where the river was
fordable, albeit we might have marched over the bridge^ before our foot had
come up. we have discovered a pass* where some of our men having crossed the
river they are cal^ back with a witness, Rouges, for obeying Commands.

That they might more asseuredly prevent enc^unters, the Foot are commanded
back, to quar^er in the Town and the horse behind them, least happily we
might gain too great an advantage over the enn^my. the next morning care is
taken to give them asseurance not to come, to quarter within thre^ miles of
Edinbourough. and now are they at rest, for they are sure to hinder our
meeting. The Ennemy intends not t^ forsake his ^renches, yet about five h^ndred
of there Horse^ had made a long retreat upon a supposed Allarum the nigh^
before; if Fighting must have decided the controversy it wa^ seared the rest
would not have stayde long behind, but to encourage, and secure there stay, we
March away, about the promised distance. and leave behind us a Pavvn, as an
asse^^rance of Fidelity to them a Ship with Arms to dispose a^ they think
good. and now they rest with there Predecessor^ (...) the Castle. The L.
Mourton may secure his foot in the ^hippe, it is not likely the old General
that good subject ^il furnish them with Arms now, that had denyde them
before. if he vvithhelde those which were entrusted in the Castle for
security, we my justly expect, for his own sa^^tie, he will, not part
with a lavvfull Price.

All the accounte the t King will r^ceive. is, that his Arms ^e in Hucksters
hands. they were malignant Arms, though ^ot in the unlawful engagement, and
are committed to the ^astle for safe custody. but now they are converted, and
if ^e Castle secure them they secure the Castle; and such Arms ^ithin the
vvalls, are good collateral security.

If they cost the King dear, to purchase them at first, it ^ill stand him in
much more, to redeem them now. though ^ings at second hand usuallie go less.
they are bought and ^ld the second time, or betrayde for naught. his Highness
^ust expect as much; if (which heaven forbid) he fall into ^e same hands. Yet
they deal more faurtably with the Earl (...) Castles. who having taken up his
Quarters in Lithco. is ad ^rtisde before of our approache.

That the world may know to whom he owes this courtesy ^d his preservation,
the provident Lord Threasurer, unwil^^g so good a friend as Castles, showld be
the first should suf^r. dispatches before hand. a messinger to inform him
cer^^inly of the danger of his stay, and our Armies advance. which ^d he not
with speed avoided, he might have been sent to ^ilde Castles in the Air.

That he might have time enough to escape with his whole ^egiment, our Horse
are drawn up to Quarter in te Feilde. G. M. Munro having intelligence of the
enemies Quartering (...) Lithco. Encourages his foot as unacquainted with
his de^gne, as he unknowing of Lynseys, to march that night to ^thco. There
needed not much Rhetoric to persuade to a Good town, the Soldier wearied
with tedious matches, and worse quarters.

Yett ye hopes of surprising any thing was called ennemy, would have wingde
there feet whose only sorrow was, they had left one beehinde, and had not
there hands at liberty to fight. We enter the Town, but Castles a wiseman,
to whom, one word is is enough, upon his tymely intelligence had remoude his
men to fresh Quarters, Our Soldiers mouths are soon stopped, though they
cowld not but bite the lip for anger, that the ennemy had escaped out of
there hands to which they had a greater appetite, then to the meat, they left
beehinde them, Although they had bourne away Castles on there Camel backs,
they marched away with empty bellyes. The Alarm was so hott and there courage
so cooled: they had no leisure to take there super ftom the fire, which they
had provided for themselves, and left ready dressed for us. We thank ye good
Catarers, and they may thank the good L. Threasurer, or they might have been
well sauc'te, though our Men are ill Cooks, had we come in season. But, since
the Birds are flowne our men are forc'te to make merry with what they find,
and soon are reconcilde there hungry stomachs to the food, though they will
never forgive Lynsey for taking away there best Dish.

He had been his own foe, that having fasted all the day, would have nicely
refused to eat because it was prepared for the ennemy. He had had no
stomach, or a stomach to great that would have usde, or stood upon other
ceremony then the word, and fall on.

Being so well refresht at Lithco, we out of ye strength may thereof, march
the next day, to Sterling, That we may prevent, the joining of Arguiles forces
with Lesly. Arguile had newly possessed himself of the town but before our
Lords had time to give him notice of our approache Arguile had made a sudden
sally out of the town, bnt at the wrong Port, leaving his men to our mercy,
and the town to our protection,

G. M. Munro, receving intelligence that Arguile was in Ser^ng, stays not to
advertise our good Lords, of it, or his design, ^ast his present hopes might
be unhappily frustrated by those ^at had deceived his former intention.

He resolves to carry the news himself, that when they saw ^im, they might
beeleeve he was come in good earnest. Not ^nowing how vvelcome they would
make him in the town, ^ee takes his way to the bridge, resolving to make
good his Quarters there or loose, his life, if he covvld not gain that ^^sse
without which all was lost, this desperate undertaking he ^ovvned with so
much gallantry and wonderful success, that ^ad his fortunate enterpise been
seconded with a serious and ^gorous Proseqution of the war, he had soon
reverst what was ^tely forfetted, and regaynde here what was lost in
England. If it appeared so great a vvonder that ten thousand in a well ^rdered
Body should destroy an Army of thirty thousand that ^ere so dispersed they
covvld never be brought to fight, this (...) a miracle! Munro with five men
breaks in upon about se^en hundred disperseth them, takes above five hundred
priso^ers; the rest are either slain on the ground, or drownde in ^e watter.

Arguile well horst with two men hardly escaping. they that ^eadge the fing^r
of God was seen in the first, must con^ss his hand is visible in this. nor was
the reputation of this ^^tion less then if he over came D. Lesley with his
adherents. It would prove a more difficult work, of another nature, (...)
reduce them to obedience, and make them good Subjects. (...) If they pretend
devotion, and Religion to coulor there re^llion, we conceal Rebellion under
coulor, and pretense (...) obedience. our treachery will balance there
treason, if ^e appear not the greater Traitors, by how much, a pro^^t ennemy
is less dangerous and more excusable then a see^^g Friend.

The Lords are at last com to be witnesses of the execution, but whereas they
are expected to congratulate the victory* they manifest the greatest
indignation, and aversion to the act. The daring Soldier is well rewarded for
the hazard of his life while they, for whose preservation we ignorantly
fought, discountenance both the attempt and success. and seem to curse the
event of that day which we al thought heaven had bestowed on us for a blessing,
and were thankful.

The Ennemy was not in greater disorder and confusion the^ were these Lords; it
began to grow doubtful which syd^ had got the Victory. Yet we lost but

much concerned, that had we exchanged the Fortune of that day with our
Ennemies, there cowld not have appeared more recentment, or a face dressed in
more sadness, the^ what our Lords put on.

The Pitiful L. Threasurer greiving to see the blood of hi^ friends, so
prodigally spilt, opened his purse mouth and said he would have given a hundred
pounds, [out of the abundanc^ of his tender compassion, and his Majesty's
revenewes,) tha^ we had not come to Sterling that day. Munro is not used t^
bribes, but if he would have given all his Estate, he knew no^ whither else we
cowld go. Lesly pursueing in the Rear. Ar^guile possessed of sterling.

The left handed L. Glenkerne publicly protested he^ would have given his
right hand we had not come. he cowl^ have cursed those fingers that made such
work that day. it wa^ Generally thought he might have spared it and would
have fought with one hand as soon as with two.

They all resolve to renew the treaty. Policy must undo^ what we had
achieved by force.

That they may express there penitence for blood drawn against there will, and
without there knowledge they will condescend to dishonorable Conditions which
for that very ^eason they had rejected before. A Trumpett is sent to give ^ee
Ennemie an account of our actions, and break a gappe ^or the treaty to enter.
they intimate, that notwithstanding God [he indeed is much in there thoughts)
had been pleased ^ut of his goodness, not there desert.] to give them a victory
^uer Arguiles forces [vvee might have hoped for a second over Lesley had we
not fallen to treating] to manifest to the ^vorld they did not desire there
Countries ruin, and that ^ey did, not thirst after blood [nor hunger after
righteous^es) they would treat upon the old Score. It Is accepted. a ^lace
appointed L. Treasurer. and Glenkerne are Commissio^ers for us. well may they
treat, and talk of the buisines ^s not thought, there will be any debate
amongst friends.

Differences will soon be composed, when persons of so ^ame Spirits, and
easy natures have the managinge. We ^ay expect good Quarter, when Lynsey and
Castles draw in ^ouples and all our hopes hang upon them. We are like to ^ay
long in Sterling, when our Treators, would have given (...) liberaly we had
never come there.

Who can imagine I ynsy will not beetray us, when he fin^es so fair an
opportunity, that used before such diligence ^ be treacherous.

Will he be faithful in a cessation, that was false in time ^f hostility.
When so easy a way as a treaty may be found to ^stifie his meeting with his
good friend Castles. With whom ^is heart went sti^l along though we had the
honor, but no ^appines, of his company; he misdemeaned himself so in all ^s
actions, as it is no contradiction to say, he was with and ^gaynst us. That
under a coulor of being on our side, he ^ight secretly and unsuspected do us
greater mischeife. I ^ish we had not the unhappy occasion to say there were
grea^er traitors with us then against us. It Is yett undiscovered, who gave
advise to Colonel Laweere to march speedily to Burntellin in Fife with his
Regiment and join with Lessey, least he were prevented as was Arguile, who
mistook his way and went by weeping Cross. but this is certainly known,
though we had early intelligence, that there was no Party sent to stop their
passage, till the next day after they had croste^ the Sea and us.

The steed is stolen, and L. Lannericks own Regiment of horse is sent, to
shutt the stable Door, to repair this ill lost^ opportunity, we grow
vviser for the future. Since we came to late to meet with our enemies,
we make the more have to discover our freindes. well knovving of the good
affections of the inhabitants of St. John stons to his Majesty, and the cause
which we pretended to be his. we go to secure the Town being a very
considerable pass, and undo the* to-bee-pittied, people, who having given
evidence of there Loyalty to the King, forfet there charter, and become slaue^
to Tyrants.

It was cruelly done to betray our friends, and leave them t^ the mercy of a
severe ennemy, to be destroyed. when vv^ take care to preserve our known and

SVch are present distempers of this Kingdom. and our danger from abroad,

informed are invited to this Kingdome] as all men who are zealous for the good

Right Honorable.
SEeing that all differences beetwixt us, and those lately iu Arms in and
about Edinbourough, are removed and a joyn^ resolution taken of disbanding all
forces not only for easing the Country of the insupportable burden of
mantaining Armies but likewise for removing of all occasions of mistakes
beetwix^ this Kingdom and our neighbor Nation of England; we have thought
fit to give you notice thereof, and to return you hearty thanks for your
readiness, and cheerfulnes to assist us in preserving the Authority of
Parliement, and those entrusted by them and withal desire you to disband your
forces.

your Affectionate Friends Craford: Glenkerne. Lannericke. Lyone.


It Is not ill spent time, nor labor to observe how much Rhetorike, is used, what
strong reasons are asserted to persuade them to engage in this holy war and
upon what easy conditions they are required to disband. In the first they ^mply
there extremest cunning and arts to invite, and civilie ^ourt them then what
little pains they take, how slovenly they ^idde them farewell in the last.
Which seems to unriddle the ^eacherie of the first

Such are the present distempers of this Kindome, [heightened ^ytreason on the
one side and treachery on the other.] And our ^ur dangers from abroad. [Or no
where for we are very secure ^t Sterline.] The prevailing Army of Sectaries
being now upon ^ur Borders [wee may thank the Duke for that] and as we are
^nformed are invited in. [Y^u were informed of that before ^he Duke went into
England.] As all men who are zalous for ^he good of Religion. [what religion is
a Politian of? poor un^ortunate religion that must ever serve for a mask to
impiety, and acloake for villainies,] love the honor of the King. damna^le
hipocrisy* there are great reguardes had indeed to the honor of the King, it
is much insisted on in the Articles, of the treaty.] And have any reguardes to
the freedom of this on ciert.

And yet unconquered Nation [lett not Cromwell hear that, he has conquered it
as far as sterline and made you throw down your A^mes, and but that he
saw it was an ancient Kindome, he would have bid fair for all. Must now
beestir^e themselves [to great purpose, to be disbanded with our next letter]
or resolve to be slaves for ever, [to the Duke and his Faction] We know the
principals of piety, Loytltie, hand honor you go upon. No body knows
yours.] And are confident [to trippe up your heels, lay your honor in the
dust, and ruin your fortunes for your cons^ience. And Loyalty. You will show
your self. A fool, to be betrayed with a gilded pill.]

For he preservation of all that is dearest to us, [our selves, for whose
preservation we are in Armes] and therefore desire you to [bee undone] draw
all your freindes and Followers [that they likewise, may be undone like
Fools,] And with all imaginable diligence [wee conceive you, no have to hand
true folkes] nor more have then good Speede] march to the Braes of Angus to
join with such forces as shall be on foot forth service, they shall be on
foot, but you will disband them as soon as youdare [and thence come to Sterline
[of blessed memorie] in the best condition you can [and we will putt you in a
worse then you cowld suspect, and the worst we can] whereby you will express
your self a good Christlan [good but an ill Polititian] a loyal Subject. Very
good, to the King whose good we are pursueing in the Articles of the treary]
and an honest contriman [excellent, an honest, simple Countryman, merely drawn
in] for so seasonable extremity [which we have brought on it by an
unsesaonable treaty.] Which shall be highly valewed [and you Soldoat the best
rate we can] by us wht are [no good Christians, Loyal Subjects, or honest
Countrymen.

your Affectionate [seeming) friends, [you do but say so dissemblers]


Seeing that all differences [but not the present distempers of this Kingdom,
and our dangers from aborade betwixt us [all us Treators] and those lately [and
still) in Arms in and about Edinbourough are removed [and the Army of
Sectaries brought in by Arguile] and a joint resolution taken to disband al
[our] forces. [thereforces are not disbanded yet] not only for easing the
country [honest countrimen] of the insupportable Burden of mantaining Armies
[to do nothing but Plunder the country in time of Treating] but likewise for
removing all occasions of mistakes [good Christians that take al matter of
scandal away] betwixt this Kingdom and our neighbore Nation of England
[betwixt two Factions, Presbiterians and Independents] we have thought good
[but have not a good thought] to give you notice [and they are extreme weak
that ^o not take notice of this and the rest of your Iuglings.] and ^turne you
hearty thanks [from the lips outwards] take your ^ankes againe] for your
readiness, and cheerfulnes to assist us (...) preserving the authority of
Parliament, and those entrusted (...) them. [now all the whole matter is out.
neither the good (...) religion, nor honor of the King, was the subject of
there ^arrell, but the Authority of Parliament, and there own ^eservation.]
and withal to desire you to disband [first let them (...) rais'de] your forces
[which we shall not need hopeing to ^eepe our places, or have better, when
the Duke shall return Triumph from our neighbor Nation of England to make
^otland a Kingdom.

your [same] Affectionate Friends.


HOw like Linsey-Woolsey looks this last letter, wherein the whole design is
betrayde. the former discovers quick invention intricacies and subtle plots,
and this unawarres ^^covers the subtilties of there plotts. in the first where
we (...) invited to engage. we are made sensible of the distempers, (...)
home, dangers from a broad, threaten us; the good of ^^ligion must inflame our
zeal, loyalty and Love to the (...), must quicken our duty, and provoke our
powers. Free^e and liberty must serve to express our reguards to the na^n.
whose extremity commands our assistance, which if ^^sonable will speak us,
good Christians, Loyal Subjects, (...) honest Countrymen. but now Lynsey
comes, and out of a ^^der conscience as before out of a rotten heart,
discloses whole truth. We insist not so strictly on those severe Principles of
Piety, Loyalty, and Honor that they shall* hold us at a longer distance, all
Differences betwixt us are removed and not one of those trifles ever came into
controversy.

Shall an imprisoned King, be the subject of our Quarrel? must we for his
honor appear in open feilde, in hostile manner? or shall the defense of I
know not what, Religion, engage our swords? shall we keep up Armies, to save
us, from being trodden down, or mantaine our vassals to preserve u^ from being
perpetual Slaves?

They must be disbanded to ease the Country whose preservation is dearer to us,
then Piety, Loyalty or Honor. teach^ children piety, preach Loyalty to
Courtiers, and let the^ soldier swell, in Robes of honor.

The resolution we have taken to disbande, will declare u^ honest Countrymen,
and remove all mistakes between us an^ our neighbor nation, the taking away
all occasion of offense will show we are good Christians. The Laying down of
Ar^mes when the Army of secturies is not upon our Borders b^^farre advanced
into our Country will undoubtedly speak (...) men of Honor, what bette
character can we give of loy^ subjects, then to submitt and yield obedience to
Arguile, wh^ all the world knows, how much he is the Kings friend, an^ well
wisher.

Noble resolutions, and worthy such men, from whom n^ better cowld be expected,
when they had written letters to the Ennemy, that they continued in Arms not
in prosequutio^ of the late engagement, but for the preservation of there ow^
persons and places. All that love the honor of the King co^ to Sterline. in
the best condition you can, and express yourselv^ Loyal subjects. the Crown
and Scepter, by wondrous Magic^ is converted into a Staff and a Pen. our
honest Countrime^ have changed there Religion. The Army of Sectaries has co^
led there Presbiterian and not long liude zeal. and will (...) doubt have
reguards to the liberty and freedom of this Au^ent, and yet unconquered
Nation.

Thus ends the Quarrel declared to be personal. all differenes betwixt them
are reconciled. And the mistakes of the ^eighbour nation, removed.

To show they are good Patriots, those forces are disbanded or the ease of the
Country; that were never raised, for its pre^rvation. good Christians that lay
down Arms for the testi^ony of a good conscience, that were never taken up for
the ^efence of Religion. Loyal subjects, that since they had no ^tention to
fight in so noble a cause as that of the Kings, they ^ould not hazard the life
of a Subject in so degenerous a cause there own. what more they are, there
needs nothing more (...) make them known to the world, then the Articles of the
^reaty at Sterline.

To give a perfect judgment of the whole Matter, it is ne^ssarie to understand
aright. Which we shall easily, if we ^flectt on the Dukes, behavior in
England, and survey the ^portment of his confederates in Scotland; Compare
S^erl^e with Preston, and you will find the translation agrees with ^e
original, if we parallel there several actions, we may ^cyde a Question
disputable before, and be confirmed in a ^th, that might have been
suspected. Sterline and Preston ^oke like the comment, and the Text, where the
knottines, ^d the intricacies of the one, are made plain, and unfolded the
other. An easy exposition of a hard Chapter. Preston a ridd^e, Sterline the
solution Murder will out; the treason Preston is discovered at Sterline. There
was an Army des^oyed with a Blow, and without a word. here was an Army
^stroyed with a word, and without a Blow. and the Kings ^einds ruined at both.
The Duke wanted good intelligence, Preston, and his Brother at Sterline, common
understanding the Duke lost the honor, which he never had, at Preston; at
Sterline they forfeited the honesty, they made a show off. I know The Earl
of Lannericke disclaimes the Articles of the Treaty at Sterline, he constantly
avowes, his assent was never to those dishonorable Conditions. yet he signed
the Commission by which the Traitors had power to treat, and determine. and
after he did write letters to the Governors of Berwicke and Carlis^e to
surrender there Garrisons, (which was the most material Article of the traety
without any respect had to the English, although he had deeply protested the
contrary to S. laiuis Lucas, it is more then probable, that afterward he did
accept of the Articles. at that time he stood impeached of more then twenty
Articles of high Treason. For amoung other questions the Commit of the
Parliament at Edinburg proposed to him; the first was, whither he did
acknowledge them a lawful Commit the next, whither he did accept of the
Articles of the Treaty at Sterline to which he had formerly openl^ protested,
he would never yield his approbation and consent. affirming them to be most
dishonorable. He well knew that it was no time in that place to dispute the
Authority of the Committee, he advisedly acknowledged the lawfullnes of there
Calling, though certainly now, the Parliament Trade is no lawful calling.
Touching the Articles, they next put him to trial. Which had he renounced,
they had certainly put him into a worse condition, a Prison. For all this
while although he was accused of high Treason^ he had the liberty to walk at
pleasure, and was unconsined many months after the disbanding of the Army at
Sterline and in the height and extremity of there prosequtions, was no more
then confined to his House, twelve Miles distant from Edinburge, from which he
had leave to take a two mile^ walk. had he been of the Kings Party, he had
be^ne made more sensible of there power, and authority, though never so unjust,
and unlawful. we are all knowing of there riguor and ^everity extended to
them one day had apprehended him, the ^ext adjudged him, on the third he had
received his dis^harge. ^ith the resignation of his head.

Which that he might save, he betakes him to his heels; and ^ommitts
Burglarie, breaks by night The Houses order of ^onfinement, and is come to
tell a plausible story of his adven^ures, and escapes. That having tymely
advertisement, and ^dvice from his friends in the house of Parliament, that a
party ^f Horse was to be sent the next, day to guarde him to Edin^urg, he
prevented there design, and (Arguile like) com^i^s himself to a Boat goes
aborde a shipp, which it seems ^he Earl of Lauderdale had brought for this
cleanly con^eyance, he is no sooner there, but a Messinger is sent from ^he
Parliament to the ship, ryding in Leithe Road, to com^ere Lauderdale, and
Lannerike and summon them to give ^curitie to the Parliament not to act any
thing prejudicial to ^em. If they suspected there fidelity, it had been a
very easy ^atter to have secured both themselves, and them while the one ^ood
under the Notion of treason, and the other walked free^ in the streets at
Edinburg. But that would have spoiled ^ere designs at the Hague, the plott was
better cast, they ^eighe Anchor, and no sooner are they putt to sea, but to
^ulour there devices. They are both comperde to give in ^ution to the
Parliament, within three days, or to be pro^aimed Traitors, a hansome cloak.
I do not hear that the arliament of Scotland, insists on there bannishment
from ^ourt, they may act as residents for them. Yett are they ^iltie of more
disservices, and later, to the Sat then the He^icke Montros, who only in
that, had disobliged them, ^at to his Masters commands he was a faithful
servant! ^e late unlawful engagement is, cancelled. The killing of rguiles men
at Sterline is burried in oblivion, which gives ^ee great cause to beelelve,
there peace was concluded in those nights the Earl of Lannericke, had his
private meetings and consultations w^i^h his Adversary Arguile.

I wonder what security Arguile had from Lannerike then. Without it I am sure
he is so monstrous a Dwarf in courage, he would never have met, those night
walking Spirits that had frighted him so lately from Sterline. This iugling is
a riddle to others. and will ask more years for the solution then sphinx
allowed days for the dis playing of his AEnigma. I am so well acquainted with
all the devices, that to me they are no wonders because I know them, There late
proclaiming of the King, is a pretty piece of Mockery. it will serve to blind^
the Common people: who must be alvvayes kept in there desperate ignorance. to
satisfy them, they openly proclayme him King, they all confess it to be his
indisputable Right, but he must not exercise his Regal power, till he give
those Rebell^ satisfaction in there unreasonable demands. They allow him his
Title, but viciously declare against the virtue thereof here is the stamp, the
Image of a King, and the King stands for no other then an Image, while his
coin is thus rounde^ and clypte, his Motto. circumscrib' de, and his Image
defac'te. he must give satisfaction to the Kirk, [it may be they will inioyne
it in sackclothe] then is Mais Jack Presbiter, a greater man of worship then
the King his Master, and shall take an accounte and survey of his actions as
often as he pleases, which, under pain of there petty damnation,
Excommunication he must not refuse to give. thus they will handle him worse
then a Text, which many of them as little understand, as there Auditory, them!
Then [Beloved Brethren i^ the Lord Arguile] and not till then, they will admit
him to that Presbiterian Sacrament, the holy ordinance of the Covenant. Bold,
forward Rebels. I wish, those that impose the Covenant on his Majesty, would
do like Cavaleeres, like Brave men, unlike themselves. and answer the Reasons
of the University of Oxford objected against there Covenant. I won^er those
molten Calves, do not more strongly defend there ^doll. it alludes so much to
impudence and subtiletie, that I ^ight ca^l it there Brazen Serpent, and would,
did I not see it ^o be a Tipe of Antichrist. Those Reasons have been in printe
about three years and neither the Synod in Fngland nor the ^ssembly in
Scotland, did ever dispute there soliditie, or saisfie tender Conscience esin
the contradiction. it is all the mo^esty they ever expressed. They confess the
truth of them unde^iable, by there Diliberate silence, which implies there
assent ^e do not think there reply, It Is so, because it is so and we ^ave
voted it so, to be of weighte enough to persuade, because (...) proceeds from
the Plumbeous Cerebrosity of a sleepy Chair ^an, or an immoderate Moderator.
we do not believe that ^ere accidental holiness, does oblidge us to implicit
Faith. ^ee do not believe infallibility to be annexed to that scorne^ll
chair, which we know stands in Errors Den The Par^ment house we know, they
err as Men, and damnably too (...) Devils, and we demand Reason for a guide
to our Faith. ^ationall men, that hold nothing of that refractorie Spirit of
contradiction. are well content, with the well grounded Po^ions, of the
University, and believe Oxford equal in Autho^tie, to either Glascowe or St.
Andrews in Scotland. they ^e fortified with so strong Arguments, that they are
high ^ovenant Proof at hand, and not to be beaten from those Te^ents, they
mantaine, or can be forc^te to re^ire from so firm ^rinciples.

Grante [which I never will] that the King take the Cove^nt. he may be a King
of Scotland. they will never further ^m in his progress to the Crown of
England. when they pu^ikly declare, they will preserve the unity and Agreement
[I ^eleve they are agreed] beetweene the two Kingdoms. yet the pretended
Parliament, and usurping power of England, have thrust forth there declaration,
that they will never admit of Kingly Government. And with the late King of
blessed memory, have destroyed Monarchy. I wonder that the Parliament men of
Scotland were such bold knaves to send, or there commissioners such sylly
fools to come, on so sleeveles an errant to mock and affronte the King (...)
they give laws to him, and will instruct him in his Duty, before they know,
or practice there own! Brave Montros must be Bannished, and to attend him for
a life Guarde all such as are declared ennem^es by the parliament of England
When those Blood thirsty persequutors had taken off the head of great
Strafford, Cardinal Richelieu was pleased to say. England had but one wise man,
so excellingly wise, and the fools had cvtt of his Head. [Yett those cursed
feinds cowld never make a devil of him.] There is but one Loyal, faithful,
and powrefull Scotche Lord, so superlatiuelie able to do service^ near the
King, and he must uncivily be put to a civil Deathe^ Bannishment, and Exile I
know there are, who to lessen (if (...) were possible) his reputation, object
his unabilitie to do the King service in Scotland and consider him as one man,
a syngl^ person, he is a singular person, indeed and one amongst^ ten
thousand men, and taller in merritt then they all by the Head, and showlders.
Reflect on his Gallant actions; an^ compare them with the petty doeings of the
rest of that King^ dome, you will find the difference, and confess his
interest t^ be more then all theires! concerning the Duke, and the Hamiltons
power in that Nation, give me leave to say thus much that who so knows the
present condition of that Kingdom, wi^ acknowledge it nothing. They exclayme
of the Dukes Treachery, or Cowardice, call it what you please, in England, an^
dislike, and cry out against his Brothers proceedings at Sterline so much, that
at there disbanding it was one common voice of the Officer, and Soldier with
full mouth, in open street, God ^damne him, that ever followed a Hamilton
more. When the Duke, at the heighte of his power went into England amongst
^orty Colonels of Horse, and thirty nine Colonels of foot ^here were very
few, that went not upon there own scor, to ser^e the Kings interest. and
amoungst them very many, who were ^ver averse to the Hamilton Faction; the Duke
sufferd but few of his F^iends to take charge in the Army some few that desired
^t, cowld never have his countenance after.

Turn your eye, and beeholde Arguile the Boatman, the Ferriman of Scotland,
see how all his purblinde Actions look a ^quinte on the Kings service I
shhowld be sorry to see him engaged in his Majesty's service, he is so
unblest in all his underta^ings; he never brought men to fight [as he has
done very ^ften, but never stayde to fight himself,] which came not ^lwayes
by the worst. They are weary to follow so unpros^erous a Commander, withso
unlucky and ill a visage. They ^ay that when he, having lost all is men at
Sterline, went to in^vite Cromwell into Scotland, which he did the same night,
Cromwell stood upon his Guarde, add durst not suffer him to ^ome within ^he
point of his nose, though he knew him to ^e an admirable coward. Cromwell
might have kept him at that distance, and be in no danger of his poisonous
looks. His eyes ^re not more prodigious then the others nose, which serves for
(...) kinds of an head piece to his face.

Would both there headpeices were off once. These are the two heading Factions
of Scotland. the Hamiltons, and the Camels. Touching the chief of the
Hamiltons, I see nothing but that he goes into Scotland, unless he has under
wrought his peace, on the ^ame terms, that the Marquis does, I mean in
relation to Scotland, (...) kuow other wise there is a great difference, the
one having ser^ed the King, the other the State. And both proclaimed Trai^ors,
and unless there be craft in the dawbing, Lannerick cannot return in to
Scotland, but upon the Kings account. The King must do his buisines now, and
not he the Kings, when he is in disgrace with the State, And how will he do
the kings buisines in time to come, that heretofore at Sterline ne^glected, and
wilfully lost so fair an opportunity. I will not Quarrel fate, and dispute
the necessity of contingencies, but I cowld almost Mathematically,
demonstrate, that had the Earl of Lannerike, a^ Sterline improude his time, or
usde but his meanest faculties to the advantage of his Majesty's service, the
Kings head, had been upon his showlders at this very day, if the crown had
not been upon his head. although he was pleased to say, he might keep
Sterline, and have the full command of all Scotland on that side the Forth
which is the most considerable part of the Kingdom but it would contribute
nothing to the Kings service. [I think so to, if the sequel was the service
he intended] only it would undo and destroy a poor Kingdom, [of which it
may be he dream^ te to be a King;] he had good reason then, to preserve it to
his power. when he was demanded, why he would not rather fight then condescend
to so dishonorable conditions, he answered; He would not be a Traitor to his
Country for no man alive. [The King was then in being albeit in a bad one] it
being replyde that no such aspertion cowld be thrown on him, so long as he
owned his Majesty's interest, he answered, that, He never iutended to act the
second part to Montroses Scaeue. If by it he meant the Loyal Subject. all men
will readily believe his words at volley he chooses rather as Secretary to
write after the Dukes foul Copy Then as General, to set before him, ^he
noble Example and wondrous Actions of so inimitable a Marquisse.

We may trust him to raise fresh supplies, that disbanded a force might have
held of the confederacy beetweene A^guile and Cromwell, if not utterly have
broke it, have beaten Lesley before Cromwells advance into Scotland.

I shall not condemn so much, Arguiles league with Cromwell, when the Duke
before his going into England held a Correspondency with the Earl. of
Denbighe, a Grateful ser^ant of the Late King of sacred Memory, and an
Archeinde^endent Traitors. one letter was intercepted from Denbighe (...) the
Duke. wherein he entreated him to make all have, and dis^atche his coming into
England, for every thing was in a ^ght way, and to his wishes! how much the
Duke intended ^he Kings service and happiness is easily collected out of his
^wne speech on the Scaffolde.

It Is no time to dissemble. How willing I was to have ^rved this nation in any
thing, that was in my Power, (...) known to very many pious, honest, and
Religious men. and how ready I would have been to have done what I ^wld to
have served them, if it had, pleased them to ^ave preserved my life in whose
hands there was a Po^er. they have not thought it fit, and so I am become
^nusefull in that which willingly I would have done.

I never acted to the prejudice of the Parliament I ^ore no Arms, I meddled not
with it.

These are the words of a dying Man, and they always carry ^ith them weight,
and often times Credit. I wish that all men ^f his opinion, were in the same
condition yet his Death sig^ifies nothing. it is a hard Fate, when his
suffering cannot acquitt him from the fact for which he dyed. yett he dyed
not so much.

For the fact, for which he stood condemned as to satisfy particular spleen
and faction; vvherin truly Arguile did out wit him. Who was neither safe, nor
confident of his own life, while the other was in being. Cromwell having
shaken hands with Arguile and they being mutuallie resolved, thought it not so
proper to suffer Hamilton to live, of whom he cowld make little or nouse, in
subseiviencie to his purposes; first that he was Politic as himself, next
as Treacherous. Of which he had the experiencie, and therefore judged it as
indiscreete as unnecessarie to tr^st him. Thus Machiavill like, he hugges the
Treason, but he hates the Traitor, and having battelde awhile in the treason,
he strikes off the Traitors head having done his work! I would not have his
Tragedy made the Argument, to trust the Hamilton Faction of whom the King
must the more diligently beeware, and walk with greater circumspection, for
upon this ground, there are those that will not ^aile to insinuate, with his
Mje^y, whisper in his Ear the Dukes Loyalty, and integrity, ho^^ treacherous
so ever the whole Tracte of his life has appeared to the world. ^harity bids
me bury the rest with him in his Grave he has satisfied the world. But many
in the world are very much unsatisfied, while Persons of so near Relations to
him, are so conversant with his Majesty. being no whit inferior to the Duke,
in Court Arts of Matchivilian Practices, if they do not far excel.

Now let all the world judge, what the King can expect^ from these men; or
what trust he may repose in Factions? will not those Malicious Villains
that have dug up the Kingly root, be as ready to catch opprtunitie vvhe:
they can to loppe off the Royal Branches? although the Independants acted the
Jews to putt the King to death, the Presbiterians playde Pilate and delivered
him over bound, what confidence can the King give to Scotland that now
mantaines so much of independencie, and countenance the Murder of his glorious
Father of blessed Memory, by there compliance with the English pretended
Parliament, and audiaciously controling Army.

The Kirk of Scotland has already procured the Patronage of all the churches
in the Kingdom not vvithstanding any writ of the King, Barrons or others,
and for carrying on there beegunne Independencie. Mr, Roe Scoutmaster General
to Cromwell, has been often with Arguile in private, has given him full
instructions.

From the arch-Traitor his Master. Englands Beelzebub, and is not long since
with abundant satisfaction and reioycings of Spirit, return de to him that sent
him. There appear no other Hopes now, but that his Majesty must wholly rely
upon the Royal Party, he must lay the foundation of his hopes, and build them
up upon the Terrafirma of there constant Loyalty, not loose his owe party,
with deceiptful hopes to gain traitors and conspirators, when all there
design is to inueigle the King, and get him into there hands, by which they
will easily casheere and destroy his Majesty's party, who cry down Montroses
power [none ever durst his will to serve his Master] let them read the
volume of his ac^s, uvho living, is his own, and Glorious Monument. Vievvhil
^yding on a tired ^ade that would have discomposed Job, and vexte his patience
at^ended with a clookbagge, stuffed with Loyalty, beeholde him stealing [yett no
theife] into Scotland when they had on foot ^en thousand men, at home, and in
England twenty. See him ^n six battles more then a Conqueror, and beetrayde
in the seventh, we gaze with vvonder on all his Actions, and but that they are
uncontradicted, showld have pain to believe Posterity will be infidels and
reading his life, will conclude it a Romance, oh that the King would renew
that commission which [as he had taken it up] he laid down at the commands
of his Dearest Master.

His reputation is so far from flooping, that it towers aloft flies high,
but not to lessening, and has the Rebel in his Eagle Eye, which he will
make his prey so soon, as he can fasten his tallons, ^eesydes him there is
none that can or will s^tt the Crown on the Kings most sacred head. If any
vvonder that the Duke performed nothing at all with so many men, and the
Marquise of Montrose, so much, with so (...) know there Principles were
different. The Marquisse perfectly Noble pursued simply, the kings inte^st.
The Duke was treacherous, and prosecuted his own. Both would have set up
the crown, the Marquise on the kings head the Duke on his own. The
Marquise would have made a king, the Duke would have been one, vvonder at
the Duke, Admire the Marquise, and obey the king.

Fac Deus, infestos penitus Rex dissipet Hosts, Tempora, perpetuo viridi
