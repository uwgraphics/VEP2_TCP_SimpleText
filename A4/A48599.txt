BERKS.
FIrst Barron hill at Reding sat,
Upon the Jail, I do relate,
The prisoners all they were set free,
Not one there died upon the tree,
But three were burned in the hand,
For so the Barron did command,
OXFORD.
At Oxford Jail delivery,
The Lord chief Justice sat truly,
He carried things so just being wise,
That not one died at that Assize.
Yet two were burned in the hand,
That Law they could not then withstand,
Let them take heed the second time,
Lest up the Gallows they do climb.
GLOUCESTER,
The Gloucester Scuffle between the Ordinary and the Jayler: where the Ordinary
for speaking some extraordinary word before the right honorable Baron Hill,
who should have been ommitted to the Jaylers custody, the 29. of July. 1658.

That Judge at Gloucester he did sit,
By virtue of Commission fit,
That Countyes wrongs there for to cure,
On Malefactors, lewd, impure,
Amongst the prisoners that were there,
One Ellis he did then appear,
Who had a piece of Bacon stolen,
Carrying it even as his own.
But though a thief in secret steal,
There is a God will it reveal.
For Ellis apprehended was,
And to the prison he must pass.
And being come unto the Jayl,
His courage then began to fail.
And after that convicted was,
For to be hanged woe and alas.
That he should be so void of grace,
At Gallows for to end his Race.
No means there was his life to save,
Or to secure him from the grave.
But Psalm of mercy I am sure,
Out of Gods sacred word most pure.
That Psalm the Judge he would not grant,
Which did the prisoner then much daunt.
He thought that he should hanged be,
And end his days at'th fatal tree,
The sixtieth Psalm the Judge him gave,
Though Psalm of mercy he did crave,
That Psalm he could not read nor scan*
Alas a young ignorant man.
That Oxford nor yet Cambridge saw,
He standing there is worse then a Daw.
A Daw he can caw and chatter,
But he said nothing to the matter,
He stood before the Bench as dumb,
This is the truth, the all and some.
The Ordinary there in place,
He thought it was no great disgrace.
To save a Fellon from the tree,
Although convict for the every,
His conscience there he then did strain,
To teach the prisoner in that vain,
Lest he should dye a cursed death,
An halter for to stop his breath.
He thought a man of comely Feature,
Not fit to dye for that base creature,
By Moses Law was then unclean,
Though people now to swines flesh lean,
Th'ordinary speak he did not pause,
My Lord I am Judge in this cause,
To certify that you may know
Whether that Ellis read or no.
For those same words he there was checked,
What Justice could him then protect,
Who did as't were the Judge withstand,
That had the power in his hand,
Under his Highness truth to scan,
The Judge he being an upright man,
The Ordinary full seventy years old,
Committed was to the Gaolers fold,
For those rash words he then did speak,
The Judge said Jayler do him take,
O no my Lord do you not so,
It Is more then you ought now to do
For to commit me to the Jayl,
To make my courage so to quail.
The truth I here must certify,
The truth my Lord you will not deny.
He with the Jayler scuffled then,
He could not force him in his Pen,
Amongst that theevish crew to stand,
Although the Judge did so command,
After this brunt, the Judge, in love,
Although he did, the prisoner prove,
Whether he could read or no,
The truth he there desired to know,
Then Ellis Psalm, of mercy had,
Which made him jocund and full glad,
He then did strain his very throat,
To read though he read all by rote,
For it appeared, unto me,
He could not read his A. B. C.
Yet Ordinary must yield to it,
To save him from deaths second writ,
To heaven, or hell, then for to go,
For to partake of bliss or woe.
He then was burned in the hand,
That law he could not there withstand,
Ordained against theevery,
To force them from their knavery,
The Judge asked him what that mark meant,
For Bacon (my Lord) I am shent,
Which shall be warning unto me,
To leave off all, my theeverie,
The Judge and all to laughter fell,
The thief was saved though's hand did smell,
Let him take heed of such about,
Lest gallows, do him wholly rout,
From living men's society,
To be in dead men's company,
And there to lie and rot in the ground,
Till the Arch Angels trumpet sound
Th'Ord'nary, was releast that day,
Who for the Baron still does pray,
And to his tongue he will take heed,
Lest further strife, it should him breed.
THE POSTSCRIPT.
A tragical comedy, it did prove,
Began in strife, yet ended in great love,
The thief was saved, from the Gallows tree.
The Ordinary freed from Gaolers cruelty
Who would have rent his cloak there from his back,
And put the Ordinary to the wrack,
For he did bear to him, a former grudge,
Oh how he joyd that he with him should trudge,
The Baron did, his fierceness there assuage,
Although he was then, in a pettish rage,
Because he could not get him into'es bar,
For lucres sake, and for the former jar,
He thought to have more then ordinary fee,
From th'Ord'nary, as many there might see,
But he from him released was that day,
And not on farthing, to him he did pay,
For which he does extol the name of God,
Who freed him from the Jailors smarting rod,
The Jail is worse then any cut throat Inn*
A place provided, for to punnish sin,
I may compare it, very ill to Hell,
For gingling Irons, and for stinking smell,
Betwixt a Jail and hell the difference this,
The one is finite, the others eternal is,
From Gales and hell (O Lord) deliver me,
And from my sinful courses set me free,
So shall I praise, and laud thy holy Name,
And teach still others for to do the same.
Two women executed were,
At Gloucester then it did appear,
By one, her husband lost his life,
For she him stobd, with a pen knife,
For which she (traitor like) was burned,
Who in his lifetime, at him spurned,
As one that could not, him endure,
Their downfalls both she did procure,
Be warned by her ye wicked wives,
Lest like her ye, do end your lives.
The Other woman from London came,
A pick-pocket, to her great shame,
She at that time her life did end,
It to reprieve she found no friend
Let wanderrers by her take heed,
Lest they for have make too much speed.
There six were burned in the hand,
That law they could not then withstand,
Let them when they look on that mark,
Take heed how they do steal, or sharke.
MOUNMOUTHSHIRE.
If you will hear: I shall ye tell,
What at Mounmouth assise befell,
In ever knew the like before,
Who am full ten above threescore,
I think the Welsh men now grow wise
No thief I saw at that Assize,
The Lord chief Justice ready was,
An upright Sentence then to pass,
Upon the prisoners at that Bar,
A Judges look will them all scar.
But no thief I saw did appear.
Before the Judge that coast was clear,
Therefore the Welsh men I commend,
Who do their manners now amend,
Except the Jayler of the town,
Of Monmouth who with raging frown
Did bring a prisoner to his end,
No doubt he murder did intend.
The Prisoners name one Jones it was,
A Gentleman once well to pass,
Who kept good hospitality,
Releeving poor in charity,
Yet for all that was sent to the Jayl
For suretiship, without all bayl,
and there he lost the Gaolers favor
through his rude and bad behavior
He cast him in the Dungeon then,
And locked him up from other men.
Then with a staff even through the door,
The Jailer did, at him then pore,
It peirct his eye in to the brain,
And by that thrust, he there was slain,
Then Miles the Jaoler he was brought,
At that assise for doing naught,
Before the Judge, my heart did bleed,
To think then of that murdrous deed,
The Judge most wisely then did try
That Monmouth Jayler narrowly,
How Mr. Jones he lost his breath,
And who was causer of his death.
Some witnesses, did then appear,
And after that they all sworn were,
The Judge said then speak what you know
Of Jones his Death the truth me show
By them he gathered at that time,
That Miles was guilty of the crime,
Of shedding Master Jones his blood,
That truth it could not be withstood
The Jury found it Manslaughter,
Though Judge he thought they did all err
And wilful murder it to find,
Before Manslaughter in that kind.
Yet Juries verdict he then took,
That Jayler after had his Book,
To save his life for that vile deed.
Who as a Scholar there did read.
The Judge he gave a strict command.
To burn him soundly in the hand,
And bade him call to God for grace
Through Christ he would his sins deface.
HEREFORDSHIRE.
At Hereford Prisoners were many
Yet for murder I saw not any
Northen also for Manslaughter*
In that reddy they did not er.
Some were for sheep others for Kine
Some were for pigs or greater Swine.
One he did steal an Iron Bar,
Two Brothers gave to sheep a scar.
For they did shear of them their wool
Or else as bad they did it pull.
Which put the sheep unto great pain,
A thief will loose his life for game.
The Baron upright in his place.
Did punish those were void of grace.
Two Horse stealers they were to dye
Whether Reprieved that know not I.
Some then were whipped in that street
Corrections house some there did greet
And eight were burned in the hand
For so did Justice then command.
When Hereford 'ssize ended was.
Then to Worcester they did pass.
WORCESTER.
The Lord chief Justice he did sit,
For that County assigned to it.
One Holder to the Bar was brought.
A Fellow very lewd and naught.
For he had stolen some sheep before,
At several times above threescore*
In Lent Size he was burnt in the hand.
And being not banished then the Land
He fell again to his old trade.
In sin he deepere then did wade.
For he and's partner stole two Kine.
To wickedness they did incline,
They drove them to Kiddermuster,
Some about them, there did cluster,
In there selling they were not nice,
For they sold under Market price.
For which they apprehended were,
At Worcester Size for to appear:
And by the Law they both were cast.
For to be hanged at the last
Yet Judge he did their liver both spare
Hand burning fell unto their share,
And after they were burnt in the hand,
The Judge banished them from the land,
Another was for a falls brief.
I did not hear he was a thief.
That time it did the Judge so please.
To banish him beyond the Seas.
All three were waft beyond the Main.
I Will never call them back again,
No doubt more thieves they leave behind*
The next assize I shall them find.
Two more were burned in the hand.
His lordship gave such a command.
Not one was executed there.
A Maiden Size it did appear.
From Worcester July the tenth day.
To Salope they went through that day.
SHROPSHIRE.
At Salope many Prisoners were.
Who at the Bar did then appear.
For thieves do keep their hands in ure*
Although it do their bain procure,
One Bot for coining lost his life,
His brass money was too too rife.
The Country still it was abused.
By those base tricks he daily used.
Some fourteen years he played his pranks
His coin was base as lottry blanks.
That coyner now is dead and gone.
Was he a coyner all alone.
No doubt his Mates are left behind.
Till Gallows tree they shall it find.
Three horse stealers they were to dye,
One was repriv'de I tell no lie,
Some six were burned in the hand,
The Baron gave, a strict command,
Which did amaze them all* with fear,
No more before me, do appear,
For if ye do, ye hanged shall be,
No mercy ye shall have from me,
He to them exhortation gave,
That they of God would mercy crave,
That they their lewd lives might amend,
And never after him offend;
Nor any man's goods, once to steal,
Se'ing all secrets God does reveal;
In Shrewsbury began a fray.
Not in the night but in the day
The Lord chief justice in Court sat.
This for a truth I do relate.
one Lloyd and Phugh did by him stand*
Who had a trial for some land.
Then Mr Lloyd being vexed in mind,
There Mastet Phugh his love did find,
For he gave him a box o'th ear,
And for that box he paid full dear,
The Judge fined him an hundred mark,
For his brave valor, gallant spark,
Let him take heed he strikes no more,
Lest striking makes him very poor,
I wish him for to be more civil,
For fighting comes still from the Devil,
Who is the Author of alsin,
And still from God seeks souls to win,
The drunkards they begin to quarrel,
when they have drunk to much of'th barell,
All Gentlemen they should be wise,
Especially at the Assize.
And not to jest there with edged tools
Lest in the end they prove stark fools.
The Judge that great fine did Remit,
Only five pounds he paid for it.
that Size did end the fourteenth day,
Of August then they went away.
To Stafford to begin that Size,
Where a false Rumor did arise,
Which was the cause then of great woe,
The'nsuing lines the truth shall show.
STAFFORD.
Fear where no fear waa, Being a true Relation of a strange passage that
happened in the Shire Hall of Stafford in the County of Stafford, the
seventeenth day of August 1658. the Lord Glin, Lord chief Justice of England
sitting there for Jail delivirie and the right Honorable Baron Hill for Nisi
Prisses.

Listen a while, I will relate,
What at Staffod, befell of late,
At that Counties Summer Assize,
By a false rumor did arise,
Out of ones mouth on him I frown,
Who said a Beam was tumbling down,
Even that same time, from roof oft'hall,
Which did amaze both great and small,
The Barron from the bench did go,
The Lawyers followed him also,
Through all the crowd, that Judge did pass
Till down the stairs he gotten was,
The people pressed on the rail,
By force it broke which made them quail
Then they fell one upon another,
And some they did there almost smother.
One Lawyer lost part of his Gown,
Another had a broken crown
Some there were bruised in the back
and others legs they went to wrack,
Some lost their hats, some lost their bands,
others were crushed in arms and hands,
Yea some through fear durst not arise,
Being more oppressed then by Excise:
Some stood by them quaking through fear,
More then Quakers it did appear.
there many panted for more breath.
Expecting then untimely death.
Many were there plucked from that place.
God knows whether they called for grace
or thought of heaven or else of Hell.
Upon the stairs they did them quell.
they trod upon them pressing down.
Gentlemen Yeoman and the Clown.
Even as a storm it came in have.
But God be praised that storm is past,
And though Reports most falls are spread.
there is but one of them yet dead.
His Name was William Pickard
That fatal fall did him discard.
From living men's society,
To be in dead men's company.
Yet many there were bruised sore.
our Neighbors harms we must deplore
the Sheriff heard one cry treason.
And he without a just Reason.
the Judge that time he did forsake.
And to his flight did him betake:
For have he left his Cloak behind,
His Page him following did it find.
And to his Master gave again.
Reward he had then for his pain.
one woman's smock it did appear.
Her petticotes Rent from her clear
Whether she lost them yea or no.
That for a truth I cannot show,
Another she her head clothes lost.
Amongst the crowd as she was tossed
Her hair it fell about her ears:
She like a Fury then appears:
The Lord Chief Justice I commend,
Who there was constant to the end.
For from that Hall he would not start.
Like Nehemiah he played his part.
No base Sanballat could him fear,
Or make him fly it did appear,
He kept his place being grave and wise,
Though falls Reports did then arise,
He bad the Jailer look to's Jayl.
Lest in his trust he then should fail.
Yet for all that one ran away,
For all his have one did him stay,
And brought him to the bar again,
Who then a Prisoner did Remain,
Till he was sentenced to dye,
For stealing horse flesh certainly,
And yet that Williams is alive,
The Judge in love did him Reprieve.
But gave the Sheriff a command,
To banish him out of the Land,
I wish all thieves were served so,
Then Juries should have less to do,
And true men then enjoy their own.
Which by falls thieves is daily stolen.
One woman she condemned was,
That killed her child alas alas.
that she should be so void of grace,
In whose lewd heart God had no place,
Her fact she did deny till death.
Yea till the Rope did stop her breath.
Four thieves were burned in the hand,
I wish no thieves were in England,
Then God should more be glorified.
Whose truth by thieves is still denied.
I have you told the sum of all*
What then was done in Stafford Hall.
If you will walk now in that street.
A second News it shall you greet.
Some said that* hall Roof was fallen down,
Others cried fire was in the Town,
Some said this and others speak that,
And some they cried they knew not what.
Some ran like to Orlando mad,
To quench the fire which made some sad.
But God be praised no fire there was,
Though it for current then did pass,
That shire Hall it is firm and sure,
In good Repair long to endure.
If any ask me the truth I Will tell,
How that disaster first befell*
Which was the cause then of great woe,
As by experience some did know.
Some idle boys were on the Hall.
There walking made the dust to fall.
Amongst the Lawyers at the bar,
And that was it first bred the scar.
then unadvised words one spoke,
Which made many the Hall forsake.
If some had not then fled away
their harms they had escaped that day,
The Application.
Man's days as swift do pass as does the tide,
Or as a Swallow which throug'th Air does glide.
Or as an Arrow from a strong man's Bow,
And as a thought which God alone does know.
As they are swift their number is unknown,
To us frail men one day we cannot own.
The number of our days God does conceal.
To Adams Race he will not them Reveal*
Because that they should still prepare to die,
that we with him might live Eternally,
O that all men would learn for to be wise,
For in one hour great dangers may arise,
To the impairing of life goods and all,
To Gods choice ones afflictions daily fall.
Those men in Stafford Hall did not once dream,
That a falls Rumor of a falling Beam.
Should to their lives and limbs bring such decay,
The like was never heard off till that day,
Let those that escaped then praise the Lord of might,
Who saw his judgments on their neighbors light,
Yet in great mercy did their lives then spare,
Who by desert should have had with them share.
At Stafford Town the Circuit there did end,
Then both the Judges homeward did intend,
The Lord Chief Justice Augusts eighteenth day
Toward Harding in Flintshjre he rode away.
And Baron Hill from Stafford that day went,
To Taunton Deane he was then fully bent.
God bless them both with uprightness of heart,
To clear the guiltless, guilty make to smart,
Then where they sit that coast shall still be clear,
Not many thieves before them dare appear.
