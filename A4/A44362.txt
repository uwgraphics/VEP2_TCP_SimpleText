A PRESENTATION TO London: Being In ANSWER to the Young Men and Apprentices,
Returned to some part of their Petition and Address; directed by them to the
Major, Aldermen, and Common Counsel Assembled and this is directed to them for
(...) Information. And to the Citizens of London, for their better
satisfaction; if the Lord shall so work upon their hearts, as to bring them
into Moderation, and the Spirit of Meekness, fit for his Instructions.
Whereas you say; It has pleased the Good, and only wise God for your and the
Nations crying Sins, to manifest his displeasure for many years together
against these Nations, and yet you say this honorable City, has bin no great
sharers in the calamity, which your Brethren in other parts bath suffered, etc.

you, and the Nation, and his judgments hang over your City, and the Nation,
even because of your crying Sins; O the pride, the hypocritie, and double
dealing, and wantonness, and all other, the abominable wickedness which
abounds among you, which are your Sins, which indeed is the cause of Gods
displeasure against you, and the Nation, which he will show one way or other
upon you, for iniquity is full; but seeing that your sins have provoked the
Lord, is it not now time to come to humility and repentance? and to forsake
your Sins, that the displeasure of the Lord may be turned from you, or is it a
time for you to be envious, and to seek revenge upon men, and to make
Insurrections, and Tumults, and Bloud-sheds, and so to add Sin unto your Sins;
its not a time for you to proceed thus, for hereby you will gain Gods
displeasure more unto you, and not turn his wrath away: and its true, this
City has bin wonderfully preserved from the miseries, and calamities, which
have come upon some in this Nation, and therefore its time for you to answer
the Lords love unto you, by meekness, and fear, and righteousness, and not to
abuse his mercies, by ^^^^^^g the words of ^he (...) and seting your selves to
sight as against him in his proceedings, though the time is at hand, even
because of your own multiplied iniquities, when you may bring calamity and
misery upon this City, and it may partake of the Nations tribulations and
sorrows, and then you complain of the general decay of Trading, but what can
you attribute that unto, but to your Sins also; for there has bin so much
double-dealing, deceit, and wickedness in the way of your Trading, that it is
just with the Lord to turn your former mercies into a present judgment in that
respect, but in this case you ought to be contented, and to be still, and not
to murmur against God, nor against any others in the Nation, but the rather to
repent, that wrath may be turned from you.

And whereas you seem to make an appeal to your Lord Major, Aldermen,
Common Council men of this City, as if they should be instruments for the
settling of the three Nations, and for the removing of the troubles, and for the
peace of his Church, etc.

and turns from your Sins, so that you take a wrong course to remove the
judgments of the Lord from you, and this Nation; for its certain, that
repentance from Sin, that removes the judgment for Sin, and its not adding one
Sin to another; neither is it in the hand of those to whom you do appeal to
remove the judgments of the Lord, for what are they but mortal men like your
selves, and transgressors with your selves, and have a part in the Sins acted
by you, and must have a part in the same judgments, though you stir them up to
improve themselves, and their Talent for the peace of the Church, as you say,
when as alas its Jesus Christ only that must keep his Church in peace, by his
good Spirit, and not mortal men with mortal weapons; though you say the
discharge of their trust may make these Nations happy, or leave them miserable;
to which I say if they be faithful to their trust, then they will keep your
City in peace, and doubtless they should be blessed therein, but yet the
happiness of these Nations depends not upon them, nor upon what they can do,
for while many are supposing that they improve their trust, its possible they
may be persecuting righteousness under the name of Heresy, and persecuting
Christ in his People under the name of a deceiver and false prophet, this has
often come to pass in this City and Nation, men have improved their power and
places to the dishonor of God, and the persecuting Christ in his Members,
while as they have bin thinking they have bin punishing Sin, Heresy, and
Error, and in such cases some have improved their Talents not truly for God,
but rather against him; but whereas you say, you humbly present that the
privileges of the Gospel, the faithful preaching and dispensing of Gods holy
Word and Sacraments, with the labor of so many of his faithful Servants in the
Ministry, and you humbly desire the Ministry may be contenanced and encouraged,
the Universities upheld and maintained, etc.

has need of you? or a multitude of wild and heady men, and Youth to fight in
his cause, to uphold his Gospel, and Ministry, and Ministers? alas no! you are
deceived in this matter, for his own Arm shall do all this, and he will do it
without you, and not be beholding to you in this matter; his Gospel, nor the
privileges of it shall not fall; the true Ministry, the preaching and
dispenring of Gods Word and Ordinances shall not perish, though you the silent,
for the Lord by his own power will maintain and carry on these things, and all
others belonging to his Kingdom, without the help of mortal men, or without
the help o^ the Arm of flesh: so that you may put up your Swords and be still
in this matter, and leave it to God who is sufficient for these things, without
a multitude of men, or without the Arm of flesh; but do you intend really as
you speak? or do you make this pretense only a Cloak, and you propound these
things that are ^ood in themselves, as to be the cause of your undertaking,
when as you have some other design to promote; would you bring in a strange
Nation, even Tyrants and their Adherents to devour the Land, and even to
destroy your selves and your City, would you set up an oppressing Monarchy
which the Land has once spued forth: these things are to be doubted, that if
your designs did prevail, the fruit of your work would tend thereunto, for I
must tell you, that the faithful teachers of Gods Word, and the faithful
Ministry, desire not your help to prosecute their cause, and the cause of the
Gospel, but they trust to the Lord to be maintained, countenanced, and
encouraged by him alone, who is sufficient in that cause; though it is true the
false Ministers, and the Antichristian Teachers through all Christendom, for
many generations, they have sought unto the Arm of Flesh to set them up, to
maintain and defend them, and their Gospel and false Church; thus it is
through the Popes Dominion, and among some Protestants also, they cry unto the
Magistrates, unto the Kings, and Parliaments, for the making cruel Laws to
defend them, and to the Rude World they cry Help us, and save us, and defend
us, by fighting with carnal weapon, for Heresies and Errors and such like, and
they stand in their Ministry, in their call to it, and maintenance of it, and
defense in it, by the Arm of Flesh, and their Church is upheld thereby also,
but this is but Antichrists way, and these are Antichrists Ministers, and his
false Church hereby is defended in the world, and this shows that the weapon of
the Spirit of God is wanted by them, which the Apostles had, and it is very
doubtful, O ye Apprentises of London, that your Ministers have prayed you and
Preached you into such a work, as that you should stand up to maintain them,
and fight for them, and their Church, against such that do oppose them, but I
must tell you if their defense be not in another hand then in yours, they are
like to come to perpetual ruin, and their Gospel, and their Teaching, and
their Sacraments, and their Church cannot stand, if they have not the Lords
help more then yours. And as for the Universities which you contend for, alas
many of you are ignorant concerning them, and what abomination is committed
among them: oh! if you knew but the profaneness, and ungodliness, and the
ill education that is among them, it would turn your zeal for them backwards,
and its not from humane Studies that the faithful Ministers of Christ come,
but who are so indeed, are made so by the eternal gift of Gods eternal Spirit,
both in this age and in ages past, so that O ye Prentises, Be still, be still,
and do not ruin your selves and your City, by rage, and fury, and disorders,
upon such a proceeding, for your ground of quarrel is not perfectly good, nor
your endeavor in the cause aforesaid well accepted of the Lord.

But if your quarrel be upon the Account, or about the matter of Church and
Ministry, leave that to the Lord, and to your Ministers, that they may defend
themselves, their Church, and Ordinances, and Worship, by the Spirit of God, if
they have it, for that is the weapon of Ministry, Church, and Gospel-warfare,
and not carnal weapons, nor the multitude of an host of men. Let your Ministers
come forth in the best authority of spirit that they have, and plead the cause
of their Worship, and Gospel, and Ministry like Christians, and not like Jews
and Heathens; for they use carnal weapons, killing and murdering about Church
and Religion, that is the Papists practices, and not the practice of the
Saints; so that ye Apprentices, seeing you state your quarrel against the Army,
upon the account of Church and Ministry, my advice is to you, proceed no
further upon that ground, but give your trust to the Lord, for the maintaining
of all things related to his own Kingdom: but the cry is, Those Sectaries,
those Sectaries, away with them; your trouble seem to be concerning them least
they prevail; but wherefore are you troubled in this matter? like as if you
knew not that what the Lord purposes must come to pass; who are of God will
stand, this you need not doubt, and who are not, will come to naught: and its
vain for mortal man to oppose the Lords purpose. But this was the cry in days
past; how did the Bishops and Prelates in their days cry against the
non-conformists, as Heretics, and such like, even as the Ministers now cries
against Sectaries? But consider, how did the Bishops proceed, but in being the
chief cause themselves of raising war against the then non-conformists,
thinking thereby to have smitten them all? but you know it proved otherwise,
and as they thought to do unto others, so was it done unto them; which thing
may be an example to you; for as they thought to have destroyed the then called
Puritans, in like manner were themselves destroyed, and this may possibly fall
upon you: therefore consider, for I tell you as an equal man between you and
them, that there is more sincerity toward God, and a fear of his Name in some
of them called Sectarians, then there is amongst you and your Ministers, though
I do not here justify the Sectarians (so called) in all things; neither do I
in every thing condemn your Ministers; but this I say and do know, if that you
and your Ministers raise a war against those called Sectarians, the effect
thereof will prove your own sorrow, and their advantage; so this is my advice to
you, rest and be still, and that will prove your own peace and happiness. And
as for the poor Soldiers which you so much hate in the City, alas you might
conceive their advantage is but small which they have for their sufferings and
tribulations, who have greater reason to cry out of their distresses and want
of pay, then you have of want of Trading, or any thing that has yet happened to
you, only there is a secret power which carries them on in opposition to you,
though as for the Persons themselves they are many of them profane, and sinful
as others, yet there has bin a power and presence sometimes going along with
bad instruments; therefore take heed and beware least ye oppose and gainsay
the work and power of God, which his purpose is to bring to pass in this his
day, who is seting up his Kingdom, in the midst of tribulations, that comes
upon men.

The second particular humbly desired by you is; the freedom and privileges of
Parliaments, as being the great Charter of the People, which you account very
dear unto you, and by which you hope to see (you say) a settlment in Chuch and
State, and you humbly conceive that to be the probable means to establish the
true Protestant Religion, reform the Laws, secure the Liberties, promote
Learning, ande.



Wherefore, O Nation and City, Be still, be still, and be patient under the
hand of God which is upon you, combine not mischief one against another, nor
desire the overthrow one of another, but be still be still, this is the word of
the Lord to you, be at quiet in your Spirits, and wait upon the Lord to receive
what he brings forth, for O ye Apprentises, and young men of London, your rude
proceedings in these causes will but destroy your selves and your City, if you
proceed any further, for what is a multitude of men but as briars and thorns
in battle before the Lord: if he purpose a work you cannot prevent it, and if
he prevent a work, its vain for you to endeavor it, these things are in the
hand of the Lord, and Nations are unto him as clay in the hand of a Potter; but
now I do not speak as your Enemy, for I love your City and wish it well,
alack, neither will I justify the Army, nor the men that you oppose in
opposition to you, for their ways are corrupted I know, and their own ends
they seek, and they are for condemnation some of them, and their iniquities
are fully ripe, and God will bring them down, but yet let you them alone, the
Lord will deal with them, and he can execute his judgment with his own hand
without you, and if you can be but quiet for a little season, it will make for
your peace hereafter, but if your Spirits rage and swel, you may work misery
unto yourselves, and to your City, but you cannot redeem it from misery; so do
not talk of the Church, as if you would fight to uphold it, leave that to the
Lord, for Christ will look to that, to govern it and preserve it out of all,
and from all its Enemies, and it belongs not unto you, but that which the Lord
requires of you is patience and submission to his will, and to be still to be
still, till he appears with salvation and deliverance to this City and
Nation, to deliver them from all oppression, and oppressors, whose coming is at
hand, and blessed are all they who are found in patience at his coming.
