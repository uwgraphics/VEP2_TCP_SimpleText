THe first that received their Trials were two notorious Highway-men, Richard
Downs and Tho. King who were Indicted and Arraigned, for that they on the 13th
of January 1679 In the Company of Richard Hodgkinson, Executed at T^burn the
last Sessions, and one Edwards, not yet taken, Robbed Ipswitch-Coach of moneys
to the vallue of 400 pounds, the manner thus, the sad Goach being about five
miles off from Ipswitch, the four parties abovementioned, about nine of the
Clock in the Evening came Riding up to the Coach, which was full of Passengers
but most Women, and no sooner one of them asking what it was a Clock, which was
the Word agreed amongst them for the onset, but they fired into the Coach with
their Pistols and expressing several Oaths, Commanded them on pain of of Death
for to Deliver, which put them into such fright as freely surrendered up what
Coin they had which not suffising their covetous desires, they ranseck farther,
and when they had taken all that they could find, departed; but Hue and Cry
being sent after them they were pursued and taken e're they could reach the
City of London, only Edwards escaping, by leaving his Horse* and running down
Hosier Lane in Westsmithfield; they had likewise robbed another Gentleman of
one hundred pounds more, that also appeared against them; the Evidence was
plain and positive, so that it could not be denied, whereupon the Jury brought
them in Cuilty of the Fellonies and Robbery, and they accordingly received
Sentence of Death.

The next was John Manchetman, a Chiru^gion, who was tried for that notorious
Crime of Murdering his Wife, the circumstances of the bloody Deed was sworn to
as follows, the Prisoner being newly come on Shore, having been at Sea for a
considerable time, was informed that she had been over lavish of of her Favors
to a Neighbor of hers, being by profession a Shoemaker; he being newly come
from Seas and coming home as it is said surprised her too familiar with the
said Shoemaker, whereupon he in a Rage threatened her, yet notwithstanding the
Rage of Jealosie, he seemed reconciled, but to the contrary retaining an inward
hatred, which she perceiving, fled to a neighbors house, thinking to stay
whilst his Anger was overpast, yet he with a seemed Reconciliation, came to
invite her home, and came up to her as if he would embrace her, but with his
bloody hands he stabbed her with a Knife under her Right Breast, about four
inche deep, of which Wound she in a little time died, only confessing her
innocence, at his Trial he did not deny the Fact, and after his being conv^cted
did confess his Rashness in proceeding on such Cruelty, without the least
remorse, after he was found Guilty of wilful Murder and received Sentance of
Death, he seemed exceeding Penitent, and did bewail his cruel Crime, shedding
many Tears, that he had given himself over to the suggestions of the Prince of
darkness, and so continued to the unmost.

The next was one Lawrence White alias Peck, a notorious Highway man, being
impeached by Downs aforementioned, was tried f^r several Roberies in the County
of Essex, the first was, thar he ne^r Braintre, in the Company of some others,
did set upon one Mr. Marle a Grasier on the Kings Highway, who defended
himself for some time, against them, whereupon the Prisoner fired his Pistol at
him, but missing him, shot his Mare through the nose but at last the aforesaid
Marle getting the Start of them, and by the goodness of his Mare, made his
escape by swift Riding, they following him till he came within half a mile of
the Town.

The next Robbery that was proved against him, was for taking away twenty
pounds, from one Mr Jenkins upon Newmarket Heath, on the 17th of D^cember last
the witnesses swore point blanck against him, and he being famous for his
notorious Villames, the jury found him Guilty of the several Fellonies and
Robberies, so that being convicted, he received Sentance of Death, he had
forme^ly followed the occupation of cutting Cattle, and lived in good repute*
but as he pleaded in Court, he had been enticed and drawn away by keeping
Company with several notorious Offenders some of which have been already
Evecuted.

Thomas Chambers a notorious Criminal was tried for Felony, the manner of
which being thus, he coming into the Shop of one Mary Hunt, telling her he
expected a Gentlem^n to come to him, that lived a little distance thence, and
desired her that seeing he did not come, she would go call him, which she
undertook leaving only a little ^hild in her shop, but e're she returned her
Customer was sheard off with a six Gallon Runlet full of Brandy, this being
about eight of the Clock in the evening, so that though he was immediately
pursued yet he could not be then taken, but was the next day as he was selling
his Merchandice, to this Indictment he pleaded not Guilty, but the proof being
plain, he was brought in Guilty and was burned in the hand*

Sarah Bell, was Arraigned and tried for Murdering a little Girl her
Apprentice, about twelve years of Age, the circumstances of the Murder as
follows, the said Girl having crossed her, in not performing a message she
had sent her of, she took up a Knife which lay upon the dresser, and threw it
at her, with such an unlucky hand as the force caused it to enter her Breast,
three inches deep, of which wound she died, so that although the Prisoner
pleaded innocence, and that she intended no such Cruelty, yet she having often
threatened her before, she was brought in Guilty of Manslaughter, and she was
burned* in the hand accordingly.

Henry ^rofts was Indicted and took his Trial, for that he in the company of
two more, not yet taken, broke open the house of one William Evans, near Burnt
wood, and thence did felloniously take and bear away goods, as Pewter, Brass
and Linen, to the vallue of five pounds, but the Burglary being committed in
the day time, he received the ben^fit of his Clargy, and was burnt in the hand.

James Matthews for stealing of Sheep to a considerable number, from one
William ^^monds., was likewise tried, and pleaded not Guilty to his Indictment,
whereupon evidence were produced that he had sold the same at Rumpford, and
that he had been an ill liver, so thatnot being able to bring testimony how he
came by those he sold, he was found Guilty and was burnt in the hand.

George De^rmer. formerly a Horsecourser, was Arraigned, and tried, for
stealing a Guelding from one Mr. Wilson near Ipsw^tch, vallued at five pounds,
and as he was offering the same to sale, was apprehended, his plea was that he
bought him, and gave a legal price for him according to his true vallue, and
pretended that he could prove the same, but his Witness not being to be found
he was found Guilty, and among the rest was burned in the hand, it being
supposed the first Fact that ever he committed.

James Dixon, was Arraigned for Felony, and having been a notorious Offender,
though the evidence was not so positive, yet by many credible circumstances he
was thought Guilty, as not being able to give an account where he was during
the time of the Robberies, so that he was upon weighing each particular brought
in Guilty and afterward burnt in the hand.

Arthor Pascal, Edward Johnson, Daniel Toppan, and Jeremiah Perminter being all
inconsiderable Offenders, for petry Fellonies, under the vallue of twelve
pence, were ordered to be whipped.

There were in all four Condemned to die, viz. John Manchetman for Murdering
his Wife, Richard Downs, Thomas King, Lawrence White, alias Peck, three
notorious Highwaymen, there were six burned in the hand and four to be whipped,
and so the Assizes ended.
