A General Sale of Rebellious Household Stuff
To the Tune of Old Simon the King.
[1]
REbellion has broken up House,
And has left me old Lumber to sell;
Come hither and take your choice;
I Will promise to use you well.
Will you buy the old Speaker's Chair,
Which was warm, and easy to sit-in,
And oftentimes has been made clean,
When as it was fouler then fitting,
Says old Simon the King,
Says old Simon the King,
With his threadbare Clothes, and his mamsey Nose,
Sing hey ding, ding, a ding ding.
[2]
Will you buy any Bacon-flitches?
They Are the fattest that ever were spent;
They Are the sides of the Old Committees,
Fed up with the Long Parliament.
Here Is a pair of Bellows and Tongs,
And for a small matter I Will sell 'em;
They Are made of the Presbyters Lungs,
To blow up the Coals of Rebellion,
Says old Simon the King, etc.
[3]
I had thought to have given them once
To some Blacksmith for his Forge;
But, now I have considered on it,
They Are Consecrated to the Church;
For I Will give them to some Choir,
To make the Organs to rore,
And the little Pipes squeek higher
Than ever they did before,
Says old Simon the King, etc.
[4]
Here Is a couple of Stools for sale,
The one square, and the other is round;
Betwixt them both the Tail
Of the RVMP fell unto the ground.
Will you buy the States Council Table,
Which was made of the good Wain- Scot;
The frame was a tottering Babel,
To uphold the Independent Plot?
Says old Simon the King, etc.
[5]
Here Is the Beesom of Reformation,
Which should have made clean the Floor;
But it swept the Wealth out of th'Nation,
And left us Dirt good store.
Will you buy the States Spinning-wheel,
Which spun for the Ropers Trade?
But better it had stood still,
For now it has spun a fair Thread,
Says old Simon the King, etc.
[6]
Here Is a very good Clyster-pipe,
Which was made of a Butchers stump;
And oft-times it has been used
To cure the Colds of the RVMP.
Here Is a lump of Pilgrim-Salve,
Which once was a Justice of Peace,
Who Nol and the Devil did serve;
But now it is come to This,
Says old Simon the King, etc.
[7]
Here Is a Roll of States Tobacco,
If any Good Fellow will take it:
It Is neither Virginia nor Spanish,
But I Will tell you how they do make it;
It Is Covenant mixed with Engagement,
With an Abjuration-Oath;
And many of them that did take it
Complain it is foul in the mouth,
Says old Simon the King, etc.
[8]
Yet the Ashes man happily serve
To Cure the Scab of the Nation,
When they have an Itch to serve
A Rebellion by Innovation.
A Lanthorn here is to be bought,
The like was scarce ever begotten;
For many a Plot 't has found out,
Before they ever were thought-on,
Says old Simon the King, etc.
[9]
Will you buy the Rump's great Saddle,
Which once did carry the Nation?
And here is the Bitt and the Bridle,
And Curb of Dissimulation.
Here Is the Breeches of the Rump,
With a fair dissembling Cloak,
And a Presbyterian Jump,
With an Independent Smock,
Says old Simon the King, etc.
[10]
Here Is Oliver's Brewing-Vessels,
And here is his Dray and his Slings:
Here Is Hewson's Aul and his Bristles,
With diverse other odd things.
And what does the Price belong
To all these matters before-ye?
I Will sell them all for an Old Song,
And so I do end my story,
Says old Simon the King,
Says old Simon the King,
With his threadbare Clothes, and his mamsey Nose,
Sing hey ding, ding, a ding ding.
