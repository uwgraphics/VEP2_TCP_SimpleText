DIEV ET MON DROIT


James R.

WHereas His Majesty has been certainly Informed of the Killing and Destroying
of the Game in and about His Honor of Hampton Court; These are therefore to
give Notice in His Majesty's Name, and by His special Order and Appointment,
That henceforward none presume, of what Quality soever (without His Majesty's
particular Leave) to Kill or Destroy any Hare, Partridge, Pheasant, Heath Powt,
Heron, Duck or Mallard, within Ten Miles round about His Majesty's Palace of
Hampton Court, by Hunting, Hawking, Setting, Coursing, Shooting, Tunnelling,
Gins, or any way whatsoever, nor to disturb the Game there under pretense of
Shooting at Birds; nor to keep or use any Greyhounds, Lurchers, Setting Dogs or
Guns; but such Persons only as shall be thereunto qualified by the Laws made
for the Preservation of the Game; and that none so qualified, suffer their
Servants, or any under the Notion of such, to Shoot, Set or Course, or by any
ways whatsoever to Destroy and Kill any of the forenamed Game, as they will
Answer the Contrary at their Peril. And to the end that none may Plead
Ignorance of His Majesty's Pleasure in this Matter, His Majesty does further
Command, That this Order be with all speed Read and Published in the several
Parish Churches within Ten Miles of His Palace of Hampton Court, at such time
and times, as the respective Parishioners meet there for Divine Worship, upon
Sundays or Holidays; which the Rector, Vicar or Curate of each Parish, is to
see duly performed accordingly.

Given at Our Court at Hampton Court the Thirtieth Day of July 1687, in the
Third Year of His Majesty's Reign. By His Majesty's Command, MIDDLETON.
