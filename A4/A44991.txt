EMBLEMS With elegant FIGURES, newly published. By J. H. Esquire.

LONDON, Printed by R. DANIEL



To the most Honored Virtuous Lady, Mrs. DOROTHY STANLEY.
MADAM,
NOne can wonder that I bring these EMBLEMS under your Protection. For I and
this Book have acquired so near a Relation, that I must (for my own sake,) do
it what good I can: And the best way I know to advance it is condition, is to
prefix your Name. Had they been high Discourses of the best Philosophy (whether
Ancient or Modern,) or choice pieces of Philologie, I should have offered them
to your noble Husband Mr. THOMAS STANLEY, whom our Island stands admiring to
see him now (as once the great Alexander) conquer the world, when it is scarce
thirty years since first he came into it; There being no glory that Greece or
Rome, or their Successors can boast, which his matchless Genius has not made
his own, and ours too, by a noble communication. Therefore to him also I
inscribe these EMBLEMS. I am bold thus to present them, that as Chappells
(which before were but Lime and Stone) they may grow venerable by their
Dedication: and Likewise be an Emblem of the humble respect and services of

MADAM Your most obedient Servant R. D.

The Preface To the READER
THese Emblems falling under my perusal, I could d^ no less then acknowled^
what I find to be trut^ which is, that Helicon h^^^ found another Channel in a
full stra^ to glide to Heaven, Virtue is embalmed Verse, and Divine love so
enamored w^ humane Wit and Art, that by an holy co^^lation they have both
together broug^^ forth (without adultry,) this happy Ch^ of such heavenly
beauty, that it wounds (...) Reader not as other Poesies with da^^ of wanton
sensuality, but with (...) influence of that Divine love where w^^^ it self is
so replenished, and feeds the (...) with excess of appetite. But high (...)
^^iums do often serve but to per^^x security with doubt, and breed a su^^tion,
that either the Author wants ^^rth, or the impression vent: the last of
which concerns the Printer, the other my (...). As for the Printer, I am
confident his ^^es are, that the Buyer will be a greater ^^ner then the Seller:
and as for my self, must confess it is nothing but the worth the Book that
prompted me to these: and though it needs no warmth from another ^^me, it being
its own abundant commen^tion, yet I must ingenuously confess and ^^de this
Verdit, On my credit it is good, and ^ing read with an impartial Eye, if it ^^des
thee not prone to approbation, it will ^ake thee so. But whither the matter be
^ore full of Divinity, or the style of learn^^g and Art, I leave as a Querie:
and so

farewell. John Quarles.

In commendation of the Author and his Work.
IT were some kind of Guilt but to rehearse
How wanton sin once domineerd in verse:
Vice then usurped the chiefest wits we know;
But now the choysest in religion flow.
See here are flames that shoot both heat and light,
To warm our hearts, and make our darkness brig^
That we inflamed might love, and loving see
The holiest raptures clad in poetry.
How sad's the world! Virtue no place can win,
Unless by pleasure it be ushered in.
Such is thy holy cosenage, which gains
Men to that goodness by thy pleasing strains;
Which else they would neglect, if the had not bin
Bribed by delight in those, to let it in.
How poisoned is the world that there must be
Some poison used for its recoverie!
How sick too is the world, whose health must b^
Procured by its own infirmity!
To work this riddle cure, there is not in all
Thy Book a line, but is medicinal.
Thomas Wall, M. A. OXON.

The Praeludium.
FRown on me shades, and let not day
Steal in a needle-pointed Ray,
To make discoveries wrap me here
In folds of night, and do not fear
The Sun's approach, so shall I find
A greater light possess my mind.
O do not, Children of the Spring!
Hither your charming odours bring
Nor with your painted smiles devise
To captivate my wandering eyes:
The have strayd too much, but now begin
Wholly to employ themselves within,
What do I now on Earth? O why
Do not these members upward fly?
And force a room among the Stars
And there my greatned self disperse
As wide as thought, what do I here
Spread on soft down of Roses, there
That spangled Curtain which so wide
Dilates its luster, shall me hide.
Mount up low thoughts and see what sweet
Reposure Heaven can beget,
Could you the least compliance frame
How should I all become one flame,
And melt in purest fires? O how
My warmed Heart would sweetly glow
And wast those dreggs of Earth that stay
Glew'd to it, then it might away
And still ascend till that it stood
Within the Center of all good,
There pressed, not overwhelmed, with joys
Under its burden fresh arise,
There might it loose it self, and then
With loosing find it self again:
There might it triumph and yet be
Still in a Blessed Captivity,
There might it -- O why do I speak
Whose humble thoughts be far too weak
To apprehend small Notions, nay
Angels be non-plus'd though the day
Break clearer on them, and they run
In Anogees more near the Sun.
But oh! what pull's me? how I shall
In the least moment headlong fall;
Now I Am on Earth again, not dight
As formerly in Springing light,
The self-same Objects please that I
Did even now as base deny,
Now what a powerful influence
Has Beauty on my slavish sense:
How rob I Nature that I may
Her wealth upon one Cheek display,
How does the Giant Honor seem
Well statur'd in my fond esteem,
And Gold, that Bane of Men, I call
Not poys' nous now, but Cordial;
Since that the worlds great eye the Sun
Has not disdained to make 't his own,
Now every Passion swayes and I
Tamely admit their Tyranny,
Only with numerous sighings say
The Basest things is breathing Clay.
But sure these vapors will not e're
Draw Curtains over my Hemisphere.
Let it clear up and welcome day
It Is luster once again display,
Thou (O my sun!) a while may lie
As intercepted from mine eye,
But love shall fright those Clouds, and thou
Into my purged eyes shall flow,
Which (melted by my inward fires
Which shall be blown by strong desires)
Consuming into tears shall feel
Each tear into a Pearl congeal,
And every Pearl shall be a stem
In my Celestial Diadem.
SPARKLES OF DIVINE LOVE.
1
What am I without thee but one running headlong? Aug. Conf. lib. 4. cap. 1.
LOrd! send thine hand
Uuto my rescue, or I shall
Into mine own ambushments fall,
Which ready stand
To d' execution All,
Laid by self-love, O what
Love of our selves is that
That breeds such uproares in our better state?
2
I think I pass
A meadow guilt with Crimson showers,
Of the most rich and beauteous flowers,
Yet Thou, alas!
Espy'st what under lowers
Taste them, they 're Poison, lay
Thy self to rest, there stray
Whole knots of Snakes that solely wait for prey.
3
To dream of flight
Is more then madness, there will be
Either some strong necessity
Or else delight,
To chain us, would we flee,
Thus do I wandering go
And cannot poisons know
From wholesome simples that beside them grow.
4
Blind that I am!
That do not see before mine eyes
These gaping dangers that arise
Ever the same,
Or in varieties
Far worse, how shall I escape
Or whether shall I leap,
Or with what comforts solace my hard hap?
5
Thou! who alone
Can give assistance, send me aid,
Else shall I in those depths be laid,
And quickly thrown,
Whereof I am afraid,
Thou who can stop the sea
In her mid-rage, stop me
Least from my self, my own self-ruine be.
EPIGRAM 1.
Should thou not sometimes man in dangerstand
Thy Lord would not so freely reach his hand,
But now he helps at need, thus do we see
That sometimes danger brings security.
1
Toys of toys, and vanities of vanities did withhold me. Aug. Conf. l. 8. c.
11.
EVen as the wandering Traveller does stray
Lead from his way
By a false fire, whose flame to cheated sight
does lead aright,
All Paths are footed over but that one
Which should be gone:
Even so my foolish wishes are in chase
Of every thing but what they should embrace.
2
We laugh at children that can when they please
A bubble raise,
And when their fond Ambition sated is
Again dismiss
Thee fleeting Toy into its former air:
What do we here
But act such tricks? yet thus we differ, they
Destroy, so do not we: we sweat, they play.
3
Ambitious towring's do some gallants keep
From calmer sleep,
Yet when these thoughts the most possessed are
They grope but air,
And when they 're highest in an instant fade
Into a shade;
Or like a stone that more forced upwards shall
With greater violence to its center fall.
4
Another, whose conceptions only dream
Monsters of fame.
The vain applause of other madmen buys
With his own sighs
Yet his enlarged Name shall never craul
Over this ball:
But soon consume, thus does a trumpet's sound
Rush bravely on a little. then is not found.
5
But we as soon may tell how often shapes
Are changed by apes;
As know how often man's childish thoughts do vary
And still miscarry:
So a weak eye in twilight thinks it sees
New species,
While it sees naught, so men in dreams conceive
Of scepters, till that waking undeceive.
EPIGRAM 2.
Why frets thou that thy soul does dote upon
These gilded trifles of corruption?
Thy self's the very cause, what remedy
And thine own hearts a Traitor to thine eye.
Thou art with me in secret O Lord, whipping me often with the rods of fear and
shame* Aug. Conf. lib. 8. chap. 11.
NO sooner wretched man beginning is
To do amiss,
But fear does give alarm's, and wake
The drousie conscience, which does shake
The raging Passions, yet they forward run
Pursuing always what they first begun,
Thus does depraved man at first begin.
To act his sin,
And put his hand to that his heart
Does with such opposition thwart,
Half punishing before, thus Serpent sin
To sting and poison does at once begin,
But when w' have acted what depraved desire
Did first require;
The torturer Guilt does banish fear,
And sin does like her self appear
Armed with her venomed snakes which ready stand
To punish what her self did first command.
By this means conscience disturbed does so
Enraged grow
That she whips out all peace, so we
Snatched from our false security
Are torn by our own tortures, such as never
The worst offender can from tyrant fear.
Then we suppose each twig that is behind
moved by the wind
Would give a lash, we think a hare
Flying detest's us, if we hear
A lamkin bleat for milk, we think 't does cry
Mother, yon man's a sinner, come not nigh:
Meanwhile the silken bonds of sleep
Cannot us keep
Or if one slumber seize our eyes,
Legions of ugly dreams arise,
That in the night we wish for day, in day
(Finding no ease) we wish the light away.
While that thy fiery steed did run
Poor Absalon
Thy circkling knots of golden hair
Only so many halters were
And to thee (fairest of the earth!) that earth
Gave not a deathbed that had given the birth.
EPIGRAM 3.
So fatal it is! he that commits a crime
Is his own executioner that time;
And is with secret sorrows only rent,
Since sin it self is its own punishment.
1
So I was sick and in torture, turning me up and down in my bonds, Aug. Conf.
8. cap. 11.
Should thou not (Lord!) dispense.
Thy powerful influence,
We all should freez
Like Scythian seas
Bound up in flinty ice, and all
The suns kind warmth in vain should fall:
Nor would dame Nature let her riches come
out of her womb:
But since thou let'st thy rays run free,
And spirit gives
To all that lives
Each several thing continues, but by thee.
2
Thus art thou sweetly hurled
Even through the little world,
But once bereave
What first thou gave
What a lean dullness soon does thwart
The dead and putryfying heart?
No high affections then advance the soul
and make it roll
About the woolly clouds to play,
And censure all
That Is here, as small
As the least Atome that sports in a ray.
3
Then is mortality
A most enforcing lie
And clay is grown,
As hard as stone
Nor can our cunning make it loose
Till that thy heat do interpose,
Thus do our wounds corrupt and gaping stand
Till that thine hand
Do gently close and pull these darts
Which so have bin
By the sent in
To our insensate and obdurate hearts.
EPIGRAM 4.
What art thou sick to death, go and reside
(...) yon red Hospital that stands so wide:
^as ^is a wound, what though, by it thou wilt be
^ealed of whatsoever infirmity.
^as hungry within, because I wanted thee my inward meat O my God. 3. Conf.
cap. 4.
^N vain you court my wanton taste
Choycest of Natures delicates!
^ere is no strength in such repast
though gained by excessive rates
^ee only counterfeit a feast,
Devour what air, earth, sea, can give
Thou Wilt not one moment longer live.
^o, but accelerate thy fall
though stuffed with whatsoever spice
^he East can yield, though fancy shall
Assisted by proud lust) devize
^o swallow at one bit this All.
Art thou so blind thou can not see
Thy self thus tantalized be?
(...) that thy parched gums be dry
The other are not real) and
(...) hunger gripe thy stomach, fly
To him who will lead thee by the hand.
Where thou may streams of life espy
There drink thy fill at any rate
Thou can not be intemperate.
There is the true Ambrosia
Food worthy the Aetheriall soul,
Which shall due nourishment conveigh,
Such as no hunger can control:
But it thy fainting limbs will stay
With due refreshment, which shall be
As long-lived as Aeternity:
O do but taste and see how far
These Sodom-apples do deceive,
They do beguile the eye as fair
Rich Balls of gold; but the taste bereave
And in an instant vanished are,
The other tasted truly fill
And further touched are sweeter still.
Mad Prodigalls we may a while
Hurried away by lust go eat
Husks with the nasty hogs, but still
We no society beget
Till that our father does us fill
And we return, O let us go
Since we such entertainment know.
EPIGRAM 5.
^t hungry Boy? go to yon vine there see
^he grapes of life in purple clusters be,
^ere meet with Isreal's shepherd, it is his vine
^^'s gardner both and sun to dress and shine.
1
How long! How long! why is not this hour the period of my filthiness. Aug.
Conf. 2. lib. 8.
EVen as the splitting mariner
Blasted with storms
^oth in short sighs his vows profer,
And so performs
(...) broken accents what his tongue
^ould not but in the utterance wrong*
2
(...) does the soul, when that the weight
Of sin does lie
upon her crazie shoulders, straight
Her groans do cry
^ishing she knows not what, yet more
^hen any language can implore.
3
How long, my father! wilt me leave?
How long I must
(...) an inhabitant of the grave
involved in dust,
^hou who createdst all can raise
(...) out of ashes if thou please.
4
How every passion is become
Mine enemy,
And draws me further from the home
Where I should be:
Yet thou can curb them, thou alone
Who never wast swaid by passion.
5
Oh when shall snowy Innocence
My inmate be!
And I freed from my load of sense,
Fly up to thee;
Drown me in blood then I Will appear,
Washed in that crimson river, clear.
6
Look, (Lord!) upon my miseries
How they appea^
Scribled and fragmented in sighs
Before thee here
Stop them I pray; yet I confess
These groanings are my happiness.
7
It Is the first step to health to know
We are not well;
I open my wounds unto thee so,
Pour oil and heal:
And when they are closed up take care
They prove not deeper then they are.
EPIGRAM 6.
Most happy Rhetoric of sighs, that bear's
such strong persuasions to Jehovahs ears!
Which stand most firm, when faltring tongue does fall;
And when thou speak worst speak best of all:
1
Take up and Read; Take up and Read. Aug. lib. 8. cap. 12.
UNhappy boy!
How art thou now become
Thy self thy Tomb?
Within what darkness do thou lie?
Such as that glorious Prince of light
Whose smiles inamell every flower
Cannot affright,
But that these vapors still condense the more*
2
How are thine eyes
Courted with whatsoere
The terming ear
Or pregnant nature can devise?
Yet what a winter is within?
What marble freezings which congeal?
Though they have been
Bathed in warmed showers, which from thine eyes did steal
3
Insatiate soul!
Which have devoured each art
Yet hungry art,
And like an empty ship do roll:
Where will thou once contented rest
Exempt from all this fluctuation,
And fixed thy breast
Where 't may repose in a secured station?
4
Turn but thine eye
And view that folded Oracle
That lately fell,
Heard'st not thou some soft murmur cry?
TAKE UP AND READ; obey, there is
(If tho^ can open thy purged ear)
High mysteries
That can direct thy feet; thine eyesight clear.
5
Thou never took
In hand an harder lesson, then
Thou did begin
Prying the secrets of this book:
For it will teach thee how to set,
In paths that cannot tread awry,
Thy wandering feet:
And show thee where the source of bliss does lie.
EPIGRAM 7.
Take up these leaves; within that little Room
Lie endless depths; it is Gods Autographum.
The hardest Book, and easiest: which can give
Death to the dying: Life to them that live.
The unlearned rise and take heaven by violence; and we with our learning
without affection, behold! where we wallow in flesh and blood! Aug. Conf. lib.
8. cap. 8.
VAin curiosity! ye lead
The mind in mazes, make her tread
A-side, while that she toils and is not fed.
O empty searchings! do I care
If I can slice yon burning sphere
To the least atoms, and yet near come there.
Though I can number every flame
That fleets within that glorious frame;
Yet do not look on him that can them name.
Though I can in my traveled mind
The earth and all her treasures find
Yet leaving pride swollen into hills behind.
Though I can plum the sea, and try
What monsters in her womb do lie;
Yet n'ere a drop fall from my frozen eye.
Am I the better, though I could
All wisdom with a breath unfold,
And a heart boundless as the Ocean hold?
No not a whit unless that he
By whom these glorious wonders be
Lead me and teach mine eyes himself to see.
Yet may a modest ignorance
Unto so great an height advance,
And of such sparkling beauties gain a glance.
He that is all wisdom do'es not care
How full our teeming fancies are
Of touring notions if our hearts be clear!
They are but wildfires that remain
With rouling flashes in the brain
If that the heart thereby no heat does gain.
He is the wisest that does know
To whom he does allegiance ow,
To whom his rebel passions ought to bow.
Who with a rude yet heedy eye
His maker finds in every fly,
And Treads to heaven by humility.
Who with a watchful heediness
An omnipresence does confess;
And not by cobweb Theorems express.
Let others seek to know, they shall
But into greater blindness fall;
And ere their course be run know naught at all.
Since what we know is but a gleam,
That ow's its luster to a beam,
Which from that inf'nite spring of light does stream.
EPIGRAM 8.
Each minute learn, and by that learning know
The more thou clim'st, the more thou art below:
Still let thy brain strength to thy heart dispense,
And think the greatest wisdom's Innocence:
1
^ Lord behold my heart, which thou pitiedst in the bottomless pit. Aug. Conf.
lib. 4. cap. 2.
LOrd! do thou see,
This ruddy piece of clay how it does fly
Up toward thee!
Ambitious of a sweet tranquillity!
Within thy bosom, lo
How speedily 't does go?
Featherd by active fire,
Whereby it mount's and towers up higher
Then its own grovelling thoughts could reach
Before that thou did teach,
How does it throw
And leave below
Those which wear shackles, but now trophies are?
Oh how it flashes
Reduced to ashes?
Yet were alive till now.
Those darts are medicines which destructive were
And cut but beds for balm to flow
^^ilst the ascending day forgets 'twas ere below.
2
Yet this was once
Grave to it self, bound in most potent chains (Corruptions)
Whilst a chil'd poison did congeal my veins,
Which speckledtombestones were*
Then durst no day appear
But darkness shrouded all,
And thick Egyptian damps did fall;
I knew not I benighted was,
Or else a night did cause
Pleased that I lay
Without a ray
Till thou, (great world of light!) broke out (...) the^
My chains did fall,
I that was all
One issicle, became
One tear, and now my veins ran blood again^
Take Lord what thou thy self did frame
And on thine Altar deign to cherish thine own fla^^*
EPIGRAM 9.
^'me thine, and for my homage, take my heart
(...) It Is, though a little, yet my greatest part
(Which can as well not lie, as think) and say
I give but what I cannot keep away.
Who took me by the hand, and brought me out of that darkness wherewith I was
in love? Aug. Soliloq. cap. 37.
1
Whilst sable bands of night did bind
My drousie mind;
And my eyes useless were when day
Was shrunk away:
Whose was that ray
That stole so kindly in and showed
Glimses of light again? both how
Stars in their vaulted sea do flow,
and how the Sun's tryumphant toils renewed.
2
Who wa'st that taught me deeds of night
are mere deceit?
And all the light she seems to set
Are counterfeit:
And if but met
By smallest twinklings disapear:
That, ways are then uncertain, and
We cannot in any surety stand
^isturbed, or by danger or by fear.
3
Who wrought upon me that great cure
As to endure,
Like the royal eagle, with a straight
And unmoved sight
The flowing light?
Who taught me joy? when that mine eyes
Were more possessed with strengthened gleames
Sent from associated beams:
Who taught me failing shadows to despise?
4
Thou center of all light! whom none
Can look upon:
Who when the world but new begun
Did give a sun
With light to run:
Thou! from whose sight no lurking cave
No, nor the most retyring deep,
Which the still reeling sea does sweep,
Lies hid; no, nor the secrets of the grave.
5
Thou! who can stop the sun, and cause
him soon to pause;
O on this Scythian breast of mine
Keep a straight line,
And nere decline;
That by degrees this grosness may
That now attends me, be calcined
To dust, and I from dregs refined
Mounted upon thy love, may fly away.
EPIGRAM 10.
Let the sun cherish day, I cannot see
The best approach of sight, unless through Thee:
Yet Thee I cannot, though I labor still
For Thou art Glory inaccessible.
^ebriate my heart, (Oh God! with the sober intemperance of thy love Aug.
Meditat. cap. 37.
NOw love I all excess; now let me be
An enemy to all sobriety!
^n the faint heart, whose nimble footing stray
^ong the devious forests all the day,
^^ilst that her foes as swift as lightning press
^ind, yet not so swift as merciless,
^d scorching heat her parched intralls dry
^^at in her self her greatest dangers lie;
^en she com's near cold streams, who as they pass
(...)with their silver footings clear the grass
^asure her thirst, but rather covets more
^e natural julip then she did before:
^s so with me (my God!) but I have been
^sued with enemies that to lodge within;
^ose rage know's no regress, But boyles up higher
^e Arsenall, mine heart is set on fire,
^ich will devour until that ashes be
^e weak resisters of its cruelty.
(...)waters prove but fuel, nay the sea
^r'd on would only oil and sulphur be.
(...)shower thy rays upon it, (Lord!) and smoother
^e violence of one flame by another;
^en to refresh me send cool showers, that may
^rease such potent fevers, and allay:
^solve those clouds that interpose, so shall
^alming tempests in my bosom fall:
(...) is my wasting out into the main
That they may draw me to the shore again:
But when I am on shore, oh how I gape
Furrowed with clifted chinks; oh how I leap
And fly asunder, that I nothing seem
But one great ruin, when the fiery beam
Of thy fierce wrath descends, and does roll
Hells sad preludium into my soul.
But Thou, whose open side produced a flood
As white as Crystal yet all stayn'd with blood
Drown me within those waters, let me lie
Within that watery tomb, so shall I fly
From death to life and all my ruins be
Nothing but reparation by Thee.
EPIGRAM. 11.
^e cheers the Heart of man; but love does give
^e principles of life, and make it live.
^s else but carrion; or a freezing Sun;
^cending flames; wings without motion.
1
love, when it come's does captivate all the other affections, and draw them
unto it self. Aug. Manual. cap. 18.
TYrannick love! whose active fires
Plumes slow desires;
And make's them swiftly taper up,
Till flattering hope
Stroke them and win them to her breast,
Though not to rest:
Yet in that motion they close
In some repose,
^s steel hovering 'bove loadstones quiet growe's.
2
Emperor of heart! who do'es dilate
Her narrow state;
That she outgrow's the earth aud's even
As wide as heaven:
Yet not so vast but thou art king,
Thou centrall spring!
From whom all passions first began
To flow, and than
^evolve into thee, as their Ocean.
3
Tyrant o'th soul who if thou please
Her powers to raise,
They triumph for to meet thee, and
Take thy command:
Thine who knit'st altogether here
Yon azure sphere,
This floting ball or what does lie
Open to the eye,
All are conjoined by thy mystic tie.
4
Thou, who can sweeten dangers, that
We do not hate
Their griffy visages, nor fear
Their threats; but rear
Our thoughts above all injury;
Or if we lie
But in thy fetters how we rove,
And sore above!
That Is circle's infinite whose center's love.
EPIGRAM 12.
What Is love? what is God? Both the like greatness hold
One is Omnipotent, the other would:
^oth are attractive and diffusive; yea
^od is himself but abstract charity.
lord thou have made me for thee, and my heart is unquiet till it Rest in thee.
Aug. Conf. lib. 1. cap. 1.
LOrd! what is man?
(...) mass of wonders clustered in a span:
One who can tell
^he eye, yet his best part invisible,
As great a piece
^f beauty, as wise nature can express:
But who can find
The uncontrouled swiftness of his mind?
How't can reflect
upon it self, and by its intellect,
When it shall please,
^lime highest mountains, plum the deepest seas:
Or nimbly wind,
^o either pole, and see where all is calcined
To save by heat
Whom cold does all in glassy shackles set.
Or ere the eye
^an turn it self, clamber the azure sky:
Yet cannot she
^ind rest at all, till that she rest in thee,
Thee, who did lay
^er active substance in the cell of clay;
Yet have endued
and decked her with thine own simil^^
That there might be
^ome little ectypes of thy Majesty,
Though he could chase
Old time into his cradle, yea and trace
Each planet as
He through his azure circuit does pass,
And subt'ly eye
How multiformious Meteors strangely fly:
But can the heart
Find any settlement? although all art
Should court, and be
Transformed into one great flattery?
No, no, till thou
Who art alone all fullness, sweetly flow
Into 't and be
The cause of hunger by society.
Then may she rest
In thee, who art her center, and though pressed
With sorrows even
As low as hell, bounce up as high as Heaven.
EPIGRAM 13.
Can the earth dance? the Ocean fall asleep?
Or can the thoughts of man their quiet keep,
'Till they be home from all their travells brought
To him, who know's all wisdom at a thought?
1
^ill pierce heaven with my mind, and be present with thee in my desires. Aug.
Manual. cap. 14.
VVEak chains, bind flesh and blood, and tie
Lethargick sense;
You cannot impede me, when I fly
Hurried away from hence
^u shall not clog me, but my raised flight
Shall bring me to my wished for height.
2
Where am I now convaid? oh how
My winged feet
Spurn all those golden lamps that glow
Beneath, with night beset!
^y (a strange pilgrim) I securely run
In paths that lie above the sun.
3
Swell heart into a world and keep
That humid sea:
Become, my bosom, one great deep
That it may lodge in Thee:
^^at glorious sun with his Celestial heat
will warm't, and mak't evaporate.
4
Springhead of life, how am I now
Entombed in Thee?
How do I since the art pleased to flow,
Hate a dualitie?
How I am annihilated? yet by this
Acknowledge my subsistence is
5
Still may I rise; still further clime
Till that I lie
(Having out-run-short-winded time)
Swathed in Eternity:
So may my youth spend and renew, so night
Never alternate with my light.
6
But should my God withdraw awhile
His glorious face
Yet would not I my self beguile
But with a strickt embrace
So closely join with him, that wheresoere
He were, I would strive to be there.
7
Nay should he strike me down so low
As hell, yet I
Would grasp him: He is there I know:
He in those depths does lie
So should I surfeit on all happiness;
It Is solely heaven where he is.
EPIGRAM 14.
What is Man's body? clay, or lead his soul?
The nimblest swiftest substance that can roll
It self ere thought; and by its power bring down,
Or mount to heaven, and so mak't its own.
^h thou fountain of life, let my thirsting soul drink of Thee. Aug. Med. cap.
37.
Faint, I faint: these channels here
Though they seem Crystal, run not clear;
What nasty heaps of rubbish lie
Within these waves? I die; I die;
How bitter are they? poisons be
Though fiercest, not so harsh as they:
Yet have I drunk; but now a more
Heat bake's my bowels then before.
Oh! what an Aetna has posse'st
The feeble ruins of my breast?
How't falls to cindars? how I have
My bosom turned into my grave!
Go, go, my former loves! I will
No more your false embraces fill.
Weave robes of short lived Roses set,
^illy's in bands of Violet:
Rare clouds of Myrrh, that none may press
To view your secret wantonness.
Such fumes but choke me; nor have I
Leisure to wanton ere I die.
See how I breath out ashes. Alas!
Does there no silver rillet pass
That may assuage? would heaven bestow
One welcome drop to cool me now!
Oh for a Moses that would make
This rock of mine dissolve and break
To a clear stream where I might lie
Exempt from all this misery,
And bathe. Oh would some Angel sit
And point me to a welcome pit.
Thou spring of life run over me
Thou center of eternity,
Enlive me once again, and show
What thy unbounded power can do.
Do but direct me and I Will fly
Where all thy liquid treasures lie;
More then may drench whole worlds; and bless
Them with their quickening delugies
When I have settled there, oh then
I shall not know to thirst again.
EPIGRAM 15.
The living spring of life is cool; but yet
Does quench one, and beget a greater heat.
Still satisfie's; yet leave's a thirst behind
And is the sacred Bath and Spaw of the mind.

Love does repress the motions and withhold the slipperiness of youth. Aug.
Manual. cap. 19.
What is this life?
A scene of strife;
A theater of sorrow;
On which we play
Perhaps to day
^ut break a limb to morrow:
2
Weak stage of Ice
For flatteries
To cheat and juggle on!
Which vanish ere
They can appear,
And as they come, are gone.
3
What safety can
Thou yield poor man?
That tread's thee with such joy;
What are the treasures
Of all the pleasures
Which ere they are tasted, cloy.
4
Then happy he
That can be free
By potent counter-charms:
And nimbly leap
And so escape
Thy still approaching harms.
5
But all those whom
Love has ore' come,
Contemn thy Magic, and
Do bravely flee
Thy tyranny
And in full freedom stand.
6
Oh happy mind
That leave's behind
Those things that creep below:
And clamber's up
By constant hope
Where real pleasures flow.
7
Then youth no more
Obtaine's a power
To cheat the roving sight;
But reason crowned
And so enthroned
Does solely bid what is right.
EPIGRAM. 16.
^ince of the passions, royal Love! who, when
Thou please, can thus metamorphise men:
^ust make's her vassailes beasts: thou contrary,
^ake'st each heart where thou raigne'st a Deity.
The Heart of man not fixed in desires of Eternity can neither be firm nor
stable. Aug. Manual. cap. 25.
YOu whose clear countenances do not know
Assembling clouds and storms of woe,
Whose golden streams of minutes sweetly run
In an unaltered motion,
Who sit on shore, while other wretches be
Ludibrium's of the raging sea,
Who surfeit on what pleasures can behap,
Who lull^blind fortune in your lap,
Enjoying what wild fancy can invent:
Pray! can you say you are content?
Do not your laboring thoughts enlarge and still
Grow far more empty as they fill
Pray! what gradations make you? can you stand?
How often do you countermand
Ere you can think? and pray! is every thought
Chained and in order brought?
Could you with patience view those traverses
wherewith your soul still moving is
Did they lie open to the sun? or deem
That ever you conceived them?
Vast soul of man! who cannot find in thee
A circumscribed infinity
What can outrun thy swiftness? what can less
Then swelling thee, brook emptiness.
That if not filled, earth leap's, and gain's a room
And so prevent's a Vacuum.
But ramble still, and feed thy fury, groan,
Cause there is no worlds but one.
Thou do but multiply thy cares and toss
Like men amazed at a loss.
Or like a crazy vessel which does lie
On the drunken tyranny
Of each insulting wave, whilst every blast
Jussell's and threaten's that her last.
But were thou freed from thy domestic harms
And wound within thy Makers arms,
How would these twilights vanish, what a day
Would't instantly it self display:
Then might thou prepossess thy heaven, and so
In this thine exile happy grow.
This is our jayle, our night, till happy we
Gain there, both day and liberty.
EPIGRAM 17.

1
Mine enemy has laid many nets for my feet, and filled all the way with
ambushments.
Hasten, can I view those eyes
From whence there flie's
^ch strong attractive beams; and stay
Lingering in the way?
^hen thou can soon deceive my toil
(...)the short magic of a smile.
2
^irest of women! no: oh how
Upon thy brow
^throniz'd bands of graces sit?
How on thy white
^^me out bloodthirsty roses? which,
(...) Hemispheres, [thy cheekes] enrich.
3
(...) could I come! (how art thou dight
With ambient light?)
(...) Phenix-like in her tomb-nest,
Sleep on thy breast:
(...) from thy odorous bosom draw
^^ole snowy-clouds of Cassia.
4
But oh! what ambushments orespread
The way I tread?
How crooked are those paths of mine
How serpentine!
What ranks of peevish thorns beset
My torn and more then weary feet?
5
But look how either side does smile
And would beguile;
How all is with Amethysts beset;
How negro-jet
Mingle's with Alablaster? how
The scattered Topasses do glow!
6
What virgins do on either hand
Assailing stand?
Whom could they not orecom. if none
Thy face had known?
Their beauty is but borrowed; thine
Does with a native luster shine.
7
But I Will be blind, until I be
Restored by thee:
They are but shadows and are gone
Ere they can run
Into thy sight. Thy beauty shall
Stand while the dying sun shall fall.
EPIGRAM 18.
^rust not the world; when it smiles, it will betray,
and when secure, does the most dangers lay:
^^t break her snares, and all her charmings fly,
(...) the art, at best, in splendid slavery.
(...) love which do ever burn and art never extinguish't, enlighten me with
thy flames. Aug. Mannual. cap. 10.
MY wishes cannot reach so far
With empty towrings; as to rear
^ge piles of marble, that may rise
^^d fiercely emulate the skies:
cannot wish me gardens, where
^errestiall planets may appear,
and rise and set by courses: no,
cannot all this madness know;
^^ght I bathe in Pactolus, swim
(...) yellow Tagus; might each limb
^^ale after it more Ore, then may
^^ng poverty on India:
(...) are not wish so high; yet are
^^y royal wishes higher far.
(...)! could I, though the restless sun
^ould not his usual journey run,
^^y self supply his light, and rear
^ithin my heart a taper, far
^armer then his: but should he go
^s usual progress; I might flow
^ith double fires; but alas! I wish
^^apes of impossibilities:
(...), whose disbanding members have
^^ouldred themselves within the grave
cannot get up, and walk; and knit
^^s limbs as they at first were set:
Sure no! can I revive again
My palsied heart, my frozen brain?
What can my strength command them cease
Their monstrous shakings, and confess
They were diseased; till thou display
The powerful influence of thy ray.
Alas! I cannot; till thou shine
And fright away these clouds of mine
I shall be darkened: com, oh com!
Break in upon me, here is a room
Thy subtle joys can pierce, and gain
And entrance in the depths of men:
Though we be all polluted, yet
Thy viceroy does rise and set
Upon base thistles; and will close
With weeds, as soon as any rose:
Burn me, oh! burn me; so I shall
Enjoy no meaner funeral
Then the great world: and nimbly flee
Unclog'd with matter unto thee.
EPIGRAM 19.
^^w monstrous are man's wishes? and how vain
^^w he do'th pray and then, unpray again?
^^at strange Chimera's does his fancy frame
(...) beg his ruin in a specious name?
How shall we sing the Lords song in a strange land? Psalm. 137. v. 4.
Whilst by the reedy bancks of aged Came,
My golden minutes softly went and came;
Nothing was wanting to content; unless
(...) mind fit for to grasp such happiness:
^y wishes still were ratified, and still
^onfirm'd, nor had I any law but will;
Whether severer thoughts my mind posse'st,
and freed her from her load of flesh, and dre'st
^er like her self, and carried her on high,
^eyond the narrow reach of thought or eye.
Or if some serious follies called m' away
^ow boldly and securely durst I stray.
(...) little from my self, that so I might
^eturn with the more spirit and delight.
^o have I seen a painter when his eyes
^ere wearied with intentive poaring rise
and leave his curious labor, and refrain
Till that his eyes might gather life again;
Thus did I outrun time, nor did I know
^ow to complain that any hour went slow.
^ut nothing now at all remain's with me
^ut the sweet Torment of the Memory.
^ood in fruition's somewhat; lost, no more
Then an half cured wound, or easy soar;
^r like a dose of Honey, when it does fall
upon the tongue sweet, and in the stomach gall.
But what divor'st me from these pleasures say,
Tell me (my Muse!) what ravished them away;
Could not the silver Thames continue them?
Or were thy mind and wishes not the same?
Or did thou climb too high, and so awake
That monster envy which thy slumbers brake?
Or did thou find those faithless who lest ought*
Or were thy great design's abortive brought?
Or did thy sins, like pullies, draw thee back,
And make thy thoughts, so strongly bended, slack^
What ere it is; now I am fallen, and now
Under my care's must either break or bow;
And that great Fabric of Leucenia,
Which should to the last of time my name conveigh^
Must lie unperfit, and dismembered so,
And be at most a monstrous Embryo!
Nay my sublimer thoughts must stoop to invent
Some stratagems against famine and prevent
Contempt [the worst of evils] and sharp cold.
But whether run I? I let go my hold.
Conquer thy sorrows Hall it is patience can
Alone secure thee, though all sorrow's ran
At once upon thy head, it is fear alone
That giv's these scar-crow's arms; they else ha^^ non
He is a man whose resolution dar's
The worst of evil's, who command's his fears.
Else what poor things we are? how weak? how blind
Apt to be troubled by each wanton Wind.
Nay man the best of creatures, is below
The weakest of them, if he tremble so.

To harm our selves with other's injuries?
And wound our hearts, with every slight offense?

SPARKLES OF DIVINE LOVE.
1
I am come a light into the world, and whosoever believes in me shall not
abide in darkness. John 12. v. 46.
COnceive not, happy malecontent! although
Thou stand'st below,
But thy enlarged eye may freely rove,
And soar above;
Nay all that ambient Darkness clear's the light
Unto thy sight,
And all those silver-streakes of light which were
Seemingly hid before, do now appear.
2
Although the space of Heaven, which does lie
Before thine eye,
Seems small; thy bulk's too little and unfit
To measure it,
What seems an inch will quickly unbeguile
And prove a mile;
Stars seem like spangles; but a tube let us see
This massy globe of the Earth 's far less then they.
3
Trust not from this thy sense with things that are
Above her sphere;
She Is purblinde, and at distance cannot see
Things as they be,
Reason may help, but not secure her: either
May err together.
Nothing more wild, and weak, and erring, than
The reason of poor incollected man.
4
But faith, which seeme's to overthrow her quite,
Set's her aright;
And drawe's remotest objects home unto her;
That what before
Was small and too too bright she could not see;
May now agree;
Faith is the best prospective, they who rest
Without her, seeing most, do see the least.
EPIGRAM 1.
^^ey talk of killing monsters, 'lass! Faith is
View her attempts) the greatest Hercules.
(...) things the most impossible does know
(...) to believe, and that because the are so.
(...) thou of little faith why did thou doubt. Matthew. 14. verse. 31.
Do thou behold, this little ball?
These fleeting bubbles? this round toy?
Which children well may play withal,
And with a wanton breath destroy.
Though it be small, upon it lie's
The spreading heavens contracted face;
And the vast volume of the skies
Designed in so strait a space.
That sea of light, which sent forth streams
And yet is inexhaustible
And never poor) of golden beams
Can on these lines his courses tell;
Whether he toward the Crab does roll,
Or give's the Ram a fleece of gold,
Whether we warmth in's presence feel
Or in his absence biteing cold;
There Is near a lesser light but here
(Whether 't be fixed or more unstaid)
Does in a fained course appear
And in its motion is displaid.
Yet never the less, does every one
(Uninterrupted undisturbed)
Go in its former motion,
Free, and no more then ever curbed:
The sun gild's and benight's the moon;
whom the Ocean flatter's as before,
And does, where she will lead him run,
Nor are the planets wanderings more;
They do not sure; and if thine eyes
Discover what thou art within;
That spirit which imprisoned lies
What a vast essence will be seen?
Stay her within the bounds of sense
Imagination's infinite;
But with that heavy load dispense,
Then she can take a vaster flight;
Nay grasp whole heaven, though it be
Without all measure and all end;
For in her strength and power be
The greatest things to comprehend.
EPIGRAM. 2.
^his globe has somewhat in it of every star,
^ans soul of each thing some small character,
^ow else could a pure intellect be seen
^o turn at any time, to any thing?
1
^ho against hope, believed in hope. Romans 4. verse. 18.
HOw come's this crystal liquor, which before
Crept through the aufractuous cavern of the earth,
^o mount aloft? and so directly soar
^s if ashamed of so mean a birth,
And so would force it self among the clouds,
From whenceit first ran down in woolley floods,
2
^n wise Philosophy, which can reveal
^^to the sense most hidden mysteries;
^riddle this strange Theoreme? and tell
^^ence such a hidden cause retired lies?

As sometimes teaches fools, and blinde's the wise.

^^cause some sulphur lurk's in privy veins,
(...) make's the wanton water boil above?
(...) does the unconstant Oceans trembling plain
^^s diurnall reflux hither move?
and forcing passage fill the springhead so
that the imprisoned waves do upward go;
4
What ere it is, learn (soul!) by this to scorn
The poor and humble dwellings of the earth,
Be on thy own wings, up to heaven born
And gain rest there, where thou had first (...) bi^^
Although that here below thou think the (...)
Thy freedoms but a glorious slavery.
5
Learn to believe impossibilities,
(Such as are so to reason, not to hope)
To pose thy sense, and contradict thine eyes
To set in darkness, and in light to grope;
Struggle with that, which does least easy seen
A little child can swim along the stream.
6
This is the way; heaven stand's on high, and t^^
Who would go thither, must be sure to clime
Labor in this is easy, wh'ould not chose
To gain a scepter, with a wearied lim;
Virtue is ever proudest in her toils
And think's thick showers of sweat her great spoil
EPIGRAM 3.
(...) the heavens thou would thy sight direct,
(...) stubborn reason unto faith subject.
(...) can thou else with humane mists dispe^se*
(...) reason sees but with the eyes of sense.
(...)^as afraid least thou would hear me, and deliver me instantly from the
disease of lust, which I rather wished might be satisfied. Aug. Conf. lib. 8.

(...) thus resolved she thinks it good

Nay I suppose by that I live
That only does destruction give.
Madman I am, I turn mine Eye
On every side, but what does lie
4
Within I ^an no better find,
Then if I ever had been blind.
Is this the reason thou do claim
Thy sole prerogative, to frame
5
Engines again thy self? O fly
Thy self as greatest enemy;
And think thou sometimes life wilt get
By a secure contemning it.
(...) EPIGRAM 6.
^ee how these poisnous passions gnaw and feed
Upon the tortured heart in which they breed:
And when (their poison spent) these Vipers die,
The worm of conscience does their room supply
I said in the cutting off of my days, I shall go to the gates of the grave.
Isa 38 10.
MY Life is measured by this glass, this glass
By all those little Sands that thorough pass.
See how they press, see how they strive, which shall
With greatest speed and greatest quickness fall.
See how they raise a little Mount, and then
With their own weight do level it again.
But when they have all got thorough, they give over
Their nimble sliding down, and move no more.
Just such is man, whose hours still forward run,
Being almost finished ere they are begun.
So perfect nothings, such light blasts are we,
That ere we are ought at all, we cease to be.
Do what we will, our hasty minutes fly;
And while we sleep, what do we else but die?
How transient are our Joys, how short their day!
They creep on toward us, but fly away.
How stinging are our sorrows! where they gain
But the least footing, there they will remain.
How groundles are our hopes! how they deceive
Our childish thoughts, and only sorrow leave!
How real are our fears! they blast us still,
Still rend us, still with gnawing passions fill.
How senseless are our wishes! yet how great!
With what toil we pursue them, with what sweat!
Yet most times for our hurts, so small we see,
Like Children crying for some Mercury.
This gapes for Marriage, yet his fickle head
Knows not what cares wait on a marriage bed.
This vows Virginity, yet knows not what
Lonenesse, grief, discontent, attends that state
Desires of wealth another wishes hold:
And yet how many have been choked with Gold?
This only hunts for honor: yet who shall
Ascend the higher, shall more wretched fall.
This thirsts for knowledge: yet how is it bought
With many a sleeplesse night and racking thought
This needs will travel: yet how dangers lay
Most secret Ambuscado's in the way?
These triumph in their Beauty, though it shall
Like a plucked Rose or fading Lilly fall.
Another boasts strong arms: alas Giants have
By silly Dwarfes been dragged unto their grave.
These ruffle in rich silk: though never so gay,
A well plumed Peacock is more gay then they.
Poor man, what art? a Tennis-ball of Error;
A ship of Glass tossed in a Sea of terror:
Issuing in blood and sorrow from the womb,
Crauling in tears and mourning to the tomb.
How slippery are thy paths, how sure thy fall?
How art thou nothing when thou art most of all?
EPIGRAM 7.
^hus the small sands within their Crystal glide,
and into moments times extent divide;
^ll man himself into like dust return.

judgment upon all.
Hear and tremble! Lord, what shall I do
IN avoid thy anger, whether shall I go?
that, shall I scale the Mountains? alas they be
^^re less then Atoms if compared with thee.
that, shall I strive to get my self a Tomb,
^ithin the greedy Oceans swelling Womb?
^all I dive into Rocks? where shall I fly
^^e sure discovery of thy piercing Eye?
^as I know not; though with many a tear
Hell they moan thy absence, thou art there.
^ou art on Earth, and well observest all
(...) actions acted on this massy Ball:
(...) when thou look on mine, what can I say?
^^re not stand, nor can I run away
^^ine eyes are pure and cannot look upon
and what else, Lord, am I?) Corruption.
^ou hate sins, and if thou once begin
^east me in the Scales, I all am sin.
^ou still continu'st one, O Lord; I range
^arious forms of crimes, and love my change.
^^d, thou that made me, bid'st I should present
(...) heart unto thee: O see how it is rent
^various Monsters; see how fastly held,
(...) stubbornly they do deny to yield.
(...) shall I stand, when that thou shall be hurled
Clouds, in robes of fire to Judge the world,
Ushered with golden Legions, in thine Eye
Carrying an all enraged Majesty,
That shall the Earth into a Palsy stroke,
And make the Clouds sigh out themselves smoa^
How can I stand? yes, Lord, I may: although
Thou be the Judge, thou art a party too.
Thou sufferedst for these faults, for which thou sh^^
Arraigne me; Lord, thou sufferedst for them all
They are not mine at all: these wounds of thi^^
That on thy glorious side so brightly shine,
Sealed me a pardon: in those wounds they are hi^
And in that side of thine they are buried.
Lord, smile again upon us: with what grace
Does mercy sit enthroniz'd on thy face?
How did that scarlet sweat become thee when
That sweat did wash away the filth of men?
How did those peevish thorns adorn thy bro^^
Each thorn more richly then a Gem did glo^
Yet by those thorns (Lord, how thy love abound
Are we poor worms made capable of Crown
Come so to Judgment, Lord: the Apostles (...)
No more into their drowsy slumber fall,
But stand and hearken how the Judge shall say
Come come, my Lambs, to Joy, come come aw^^
