THE EPISTLE TO THE READER.
I Need not say much in the praise of this Book, but rather leave it to the
censure of the impartial Reader, who I doubt not will find such pleasure in
perusing it, that he will never think his time ill bestowed upon that occasion;
for in it, as in a mirror, is plainly demonstrated all the follies of
extravagant Youth, the vanity of aspiring greatness, the trouble, perplexity
and hazards, that commonly attend upon Riches; as likewise the malice, subtilty
and cunning devices of wicked men; together with the snares that are laid by
false and dissembling Women to entrap the too too credulous Youths, and then to
plunge them into an Ocean of misery, which many times drives them upon the
dangerous Rock of despair, or causes them to take bad courses to maintain that
pride and gallantry from whence they are fallen, which in the end most commonly
brings them to shame and disgrace: In it are likewise contained many cautions
how to avoid danger, and to foresee the same. It being composed of large
experience, partly Commical and partly Tragical: giving not only an account of
the Life, strange Adventures, and Death of the party from whom it takes its
name, but likewise of several as well Kings and Princes as others. As also a
description of many strange Countries, with their manners, customs, and
commodities: And to conclude, is so delightful that none of this nature have
excelled it; it being written as well for pleasure as profit.

The Contents of the BOOK.
IN Cyprus Isle lived Theodorus famed,
In a fair City Famagosto named;
Extravagant and wild he spent his store,
That by excess he grew so wondrous poor,
That Fortunatus all the Sons he had
Was forced to wander as kind fortune led:
When often he death and danger did escape,
Encountering Bares or worse in humane shape.
When as by chance he did Dame Fortune meet,
Who him (lost in a darksome Wood) did greet,
Gave him a Purse that he should never be poor,
And bid his Sons likewise possess the store:
With this he roves the world from coast to coast,
Leopoldo hires (who kills the faithless Host)
To Cyprus he returns, his Parents dead,
There builds a Palace and a Wife does wed;
Leaving Two Sons again to Travel bent,
When in strange Countries sixteen years he spent.
Returning from the Souldan King does bear
A Hat (which wishing) bares him through the air.
Returns (and dying) to his Sons bequeaths
His Hat and Purse and all their virtues leaves.
Ampedo eldest, Andolocia next,
Their Mother dies with grief so sore perplexed.
When Andolocia with the Purse does rome,
And mild Ampedo stays content at home.
After much fame acquired in Princes Courts,
To England Andolocia straight resorts,
And spends his time in feasting and in sports.
Till Agrippina's beauty proves a snare,
And makes him whence his Riches flow declare.
Then whilst he is with drowsiness oppressed,
He of his Purse is quickly dispossessed.
Then from his Brother he conveys the Hat,
With which after much toil the Purse he got.
The Princess is to Theodorus Wed,
Young Cyprus Prince, and to that Court is led.
There Andolocia by his martial feats
The envy of some envious Nobles gets.
Who in a wood at his return do slay
His Men, and him in a deep Dungeon lay;
Bereave him of his Purse and then his life,
For which 2 Earls did dye to end the strife.
Ampedo hearing of his Brothers death,
Burns his swift Hat, and then resigns his breath.
THE HISTORY OF FORTUNATUS.
CHAP. I.
Of the Parentage and Birth of Fortunatus.

IN Famogosta a Famous City in the Isle of Cyprus, lived one Theodorus
descended of Noble Patentage, who by the Decease of his Father, had a plentiful
Estate fell into his hands; but he being of a haughty Mind, gave himself wholly
up to the Pleasures and Vanity of the World: He associated himself with the
Great Men of the Country, and lived riotously, spending his time for the most
part in Gaming, Hunting, Hawking, and Sumptuous Entertainments, the which in a
short time greatly diminished his Estate; which his Friends perceiving, and
being much grieved thereat, thought there was no better way to restrain his
Licentious manner of Life, than by matching him to a Wife.

This being resolved upon, and he not contradicting the Motion, they sought for
a fair, young and virtuous Lady throughout all the Citys of Cyprus, and at last
in Nicova found one that well-liked them, she being Daughter to a Wealthy
Merchant, and adorned with all the Perfections that appertain to Womankind, her
Name being Gratiana: to this Lady by the Consent of her Father, Theodorus was
shortly married, and for a time lived in great Splendour, the first Year having
by her a fair Son, whom they named Fortunatus; but this little or nothing
restrained his Extravagancies: Insomuch that in a short time after the
Marriage, notwithstanding the large Portion he had with his Wife, he was
brought to extreme Poverty, which made him repent, though now too late; so that
oftentimes being hunger-pined, and in great want, he looking upon his Son (who
by this time was a comely Youth) would sigh and let fall Tears, which so
afflicted the Young Man, that he one day demanded the Cause, desiring to know
whether he had offended him in ought, the which if he had he would strive to
amend it: To whom the sorrowful Father replied, He had never offended him; but
it was the exceeding Penury to which by his Extravagancies he was reduced to
that maded as he saw: To which the Youth replied, Let not that trouble you, for
as for me, I have received such good Education under you, that I can shift for
my self in any place of the World; but he perceiving his Father still troubled,
and always sigh when he looked upon him, he conjectured it was for his sake,
and therefore resolved to be no longer chargeable to him: Whereupon one Day
taking his Stick in his hand, he went to the Seaside, where he had not stayed
long, but a Gasly put to shore, in which was the Earl of Flanders, who was
returned from Jerusalem; they had not been long on shore to refresh themselves,
but the Earl caused the Trumpet to sound, to call his men back into the Galley;
which Fortunatus perceiving, and being desirous to Travel, went to the Earl and
offered him his Service: When the Earl perceiving him a goodly Youth, and
having by reason of sickness, lost two of his men by the way, he entertained
him; when as the Earl and Fortunatus being on Board, they set Sail, and in a
short time arrived at Venice.

CHAP. II.
How Fortunatus departed his Country, and how he became greatly esteemed by the
Earl.

AFter some Contests with the Winds and Sea, the Galley safely arrived at
Venice, where the Earl and his Men landed; and there by the help of Fortunatus
(who amongst all his men could only speak the Language) he bought rich Jewels,
and Gold Imbroderies, in order to his Marriage, he being to Wed the Duke of
Cleves Daughter at his return, to whom he had been Contracted before his
departure. By these and such other Services, Fortunatus gained the Love of his
Lord; insomuch that the rest of the Servants began to envy him: A while after
the Earl coming into his own Country, bought all his Servants Horses, and gave
to Fortunatus the best next what himself rod on; so that it greatly grieved the
rest of the Servants, who wished the Devil had had the Italian before he came
into their Lords Service. A while after the Marriage being Celebrated, a great
number of Nobility being present, Tilts and Iusts were prepared, where after
the Nobles had done great Feats, the Earl set up two Jewels valued at a hundred
pounds, for the Servants who should do best; upon which Fortunatus prepared his
Horse, and soon with his Lance overthrew one of them that run against him,
whereupon he carried away the Prize; then one Timothy having won the other
Jewel, the Servants urged Timothy to Just with Fortunatus, who should have them
both; but in the Conflict Timothy was born down Horse and Man, so that
Fortunatus woodcut of a joust repetitive woodcut of multiple trees got not
only both the Jewels, but the great Applause of the Spectators, and the
greater Favor of the Earl, who highly praised him, telling them by what chance
he had met with him: whereupon the Nobles and Ladies gave him many Presents;
this more and more raised the Malice of his Fellow Servants against him; but
when they well perceived that they could do nothing against him fairly, they
wrought by subtilty: for there being amongst the rest one Robert an ancient
Servant to the Earl, who promised for Ten Crowns to make Fortunatus run away;
to this they gladly hearkened, and every one paid his Dividend most joyfully:
when this was done, he insinuates himself into the company of Fortunatus,
expressing more than ordinary kindness, carrying him abroad to Treats, and
other Meriments, without suffering him to pay ought; this Fortunatus imagining
to proceed from the entire good will he bore him, he gave the greater credit to
all he said, not perceiving his subtilty: When the Money was almost spent, and
the Servants began to put Robert in mind of his Promise, he one day taking
Fortunatus into a private Apartment, after several Discourses, he began to sigh
and look sad, which Fortunatus well noting, demanded the Cause, who told him it
was for his sake: then was he earnest to know the Reason; truly said Robert it
was told me by my singular good Friend, who upon a great Penalty enjoined me
Secrecy, but for the Love and good Will I bare to you, I shall reveal it. Then
thus our Lord intends to Morrow to Ride to Lausan, to wage Law against the Earl
of St. Paul, where for the jealousy he had lately conceived of his
Chamberlains, least they should either have carnal Copulation with his beateous
Wife, or any of her fair Ladies and Gentlewomen that attended her, he is
resolved to have them all Gelded, and though he entirely loves you above any of
his Servants, yet he cannot serve the rest so while you take part with them in
the same, you being chief Chamberlain, and the most comely amongst them, after
which he will only reveal it ho his Lady, forbidding her to reveal it; but as
the manner of Women is, it cannot be expected that she will keep the Secret
long; so that it being spread abroad, it will redoun to your utter Disgrace, if
the cutting do not hazard your Life: this I learned from him who is appointed
to Geld you, he telling it me (as thinking I might be one of the Chamberlains)
in requital of some singular Favors I had done him.

When Fortunatus heard this he looked as pale as Death; and desired Robert by
all the Ties of Friendship, that he would be assisting to him in making his
escape; for said he, I would not be Gelded if my Lord would give me his
Earldom: When he talked of Flight, the Hypocrite Robert feigned himself sad,
and desired his stay, the better to persuade him into a Belief of what he had
related, telling him he was sorry that ever he had Imparted it to him; but
Fortunatus standing as it were upon thorns, thought every hour ten, till he was
gone; then Robert bid him in what place soever he resided, send him a Letter,
that when the Earl was supplied with Gelded-men, he might give notice to
return: But Fortunatus replied, he would never return, though he endured never
such necessity or want. Upon this Robert inwardly cejoyced, and helping him to
a horse, he rod out of the City as if he went on hunting, and having passed the
Gate, set on full speed and never looked behind him, till he thought himself
out of Danger, and purchasing another horse, he sent back the Earls, lest upon
that account he might be pursued.

CHAP. III.
How the Earl grieved for the Departure of Fortunatus; and what befell him
afterward.

NO sooner the flight of Fortunatus came to the Earls Ear, but he was exceeding
sorry, musing with himself what should be the Cause; but when he could think of
none, he demanded of his Servants if they were privy to the Occasion of his
Departure, but they denied they knew ought: then he examined his Lady and her
Gentlewomen who were there at the same time, saying, that the Evening before he
was very pleasant, and had discoursed to them about several Affairs of Women,
and other things; at which the Earl marvelled the more, saying, Although he
could not then learn the true Cause of his Departing without taking leave of
him, he doubted not but that he should find it out, and he would severely
punish the Occasioner of it: This terrified Robert, so that he grew very
Melancholy, lest any of the Servants should betray him; and thereupon he took
an Oath of Secrecy of them all, and when they were importunate to know by what
means he had effected it, he told them a story of his Fathers Advancement by
the King of Cyprus, quite contrary to what he had practiced. But to return to
Fortunatus:

Fortunatus being on his way, made what speed he could to Calice, where espying
an English Ship, he bargained with the Master to Transport him into England,
where arriving, he came to London, where he happened into the company of two
young Cyprus Merchants, who were sent over by their Fathers too, with a Ship
laden with costly Wares, for which they had received great Sums of Money: And
now Fortunatus being expert in the Manners and Customs of most Countries,
became as it were their Tutor or Instructor; so that they spent beyond measure,
Rioting it all the Day at Taverns, and at Night sporting it with Harlots, each
one striving to outdo the other in Excess; nor was Fortunatus wanting to spend
amongst them: but within a while all their Money being spent, their Burom
Lasses forsook them, and all their Iollitry came to an end, which made the
Merchants bethink themselves of Returning home, which they did in the same Ship
they came in, though with heavy hearts and empty Purses, leaving Fortunatus
behind them.

CHAP. IV.
How Fortunatus became a Servant, and how one wicked Andrew by murdering a
Gentleman in the house of Fortunatus's Master, brought the whole Family in
great trouble.

FOrtunatus being bare of Money and in a strange Country, knew not well what
course to take; but at last resolved to get over into France, but wanted Money
to pay his Passage; when gorng to a Harlot on whom he spent the greatest part
of his money, he desired her to lend him two Crowns, telling her that he was to
go over Sea to fetch Four hundred Crowns that his Uncle owed him; but she would
by no means lend him any, nor scarcely make him drink, but sent him away with
flouts: Then seeing his former Folly, he wished, (though too late) that he had
kept his Money, and not have spent it upon such an ungrateful Baggage; so that
not having Money to pay for his Passage, he betook himself to the Service of
one Jeronimus Roberti, a Florentine Merchant in Lombard Street, where he lived
with great Credit, pleasing his Master beyond measure by his Diligence and
towardness, and in a short time gained not only the Love of his Mistress, but
of all the Servants: Insomuch that his Master not only entrusted him with all
his Cash, but employed him in his main Affairs; as taking in his Merchandise,
and other things of secret and weighty Concernment, whereby he not only
advantaged himself, but also by his faithful Discharge of the Trust committed
to him; he greatly advantaged his Master, insomuch that he became dear to him;
but he had not long continued in his Service, before an Extravagant Florentine
came to his Master, whose Name was Andrew, the Son of a very responsible
Merchant, who had been fitted out with a Ship and all manner of Merchandise,
the which he had sold and imbezled at a lavish Rate; and thereupon was driven
to extreme Poverty, which obliged him to live by his Wits; so that bethinking
himself, he counterfeited Bills of Exchange, and by that means so drained his
Father of what Moneys he had, that in expectation of what should be returned by
Merchandise, he utterly Impoverished him; the which when he perceived, and that
no more Money was to be had, he betook himself to Shifts, and being at Bruges,
the place were he had spent the greatest part of his Money, he began to bethink
himself that it was in vain for him to return, by reason of the great Injury he
had done his Father, and then again considering that those whom he had spent
his Moneys upon, began to slight him, and that he could neither borrow any, nor
be trusted for such convenient things as were appertaining to the Supply of
Nature, he much condoled and bewailed his sad Condition whereinto by reason of
his Extravagancy he was fallen, and resolved whatever bety'd him to return to
his Father; when in his Travels homeward he came to the City of Turene in
France, where by his Host he understood that a Merchant of London, upon a
spiteful Accusation, lay in Irons in a dark Dungeon, and that he being very
rich, would plentifully reward any One that would go over into England and
solicit his Business, so that he might be delivered. At this News Andrew
rejoiced not a little, and thereupon asked his Host whether free access might
be had to this Merchant? To which the Host answered, that for a small piece of
money he might so far prevail with the Keeper as to admit him to the speech of
the Merchant: Whereupon he resolved to make the best of his time, preparing a
Ducket for that purpose, for which the Keeper joyfully let him in; when he was
entered the Prison or Dungeon, by a Light that he had with him, he espied the
Merchant who lay fast Fettered in Irons, to whom he addressed himself in
English; upon which the Merchant was not a little over-joyed, asking him if he
knew such and such Persons, among whom he named Jeronimo Roberti; to which he
replied, that he knew him very well, and that he had not only been acquainted
with him in England, but likewise in the City of Florence; then he showed him
the Cause of his Imprisonment, which was for Forging the King of Englands
Passport, desiring him out of all love that he would speedily repair to
London; and show unto his Friends in what a sad condition he lay, and how
pitifully he had been handled since his coming into that Prison, and to desire
them to solicit his Enlargement, for which he would not only think himself
Infinitely Obliged to him, but would reward him with Five hundred Crowns.

At this welcome News Andrew did not a lictle rejoice, so that taking some
moneys of him to bear his Charges, he departed, promising to do his best in
order to his Delivery; and thereupon took Shipping for England, and coming to
London, he made it his business to go from place to place to the Merchants
Friends, as also to the Court, where he understood he could not be released
unless he paid a Fine of Three thousand Crowns, the which Jeronimo Roberti
promised to lay down upon Security: So that Andrew going from place to place to
get one to enter into Bonds for the Sum, at last understood that the King
having married his Daughter to the Duke of Burgundia, resolved to make her a
Present of the richest Jewels that might be got, having already caused his
Iewellers to make them, and deliver them to a trusty Knight, who was appointed
to convey them to her. At this Andrew inwardly rejoiced; and now despairing of
getting Security of the Sum of Money demanded, he resolved not to lose his
labor of coming into England; and thereupon by his frequenting the Court, got
acquainted with the Iewel-Bearer, and finding out a fit Opportunity, told him
that he was by Birth a Florentine, and by Profession a Ieweller; and forasmuch
as he heard the King of England was minded to purchase the best Jewels he could
get, he had come out of his own Country with a parcel of such Jewels as he
believed the like were not to be had in England; and thereupon desired the
Gentleman to let him see those he had in charge, the which he readily did, not
dreaming of his design.

When Andrew had well viewed them, and by their fairness could not imagine less
but that they were of a great value, he told the Gentleman that many of his
exceeded them, not only in Luster but in Virtue, as being Stones of a different
Nature, especially one Locket of Black Diamonds which he had purchased of a
Jew, who lately came from the Indies: upon this the Gentleman told him, that if
he might but see them, he doubted not but that the King would at least purchase
some of them, and thereupon he desired him to stay and dine with him, the which
he did, and after dinner, Andrew invited the Gentleman to come the next Day to
Jeronimus Roberti's House to dine with him, and that there he should have a
sight of them: this he consented to, and leave taken, Andrew went to Jeronimus
Roberti and informed him, that he had met with a Gentleman of a good Estate,
who for the love he bore to the Merchant would become bound for the 3000
Crowns, and withal told him; that he intended to be there the next Day, and
therefore he advised him to prepare a dinner to entertain him, and not to speak
any thing to him about his Surety-ship till he should give the Signet; to this
Jeronimus consented, as well knowing he should have good Interest for his
Money. The next Day the Gentleman came, and the Table being spread, they sat
down to dinner, and there discoursed of Diverse Affairs, when after they were
risen from the Table, Andrew took the Gentleman by the hand and led him up
stairs pretending to show him his Jewels, and there taking his opportunity
before the Gentleman was aware, with a Dagger that he had provided for the
purpose, he stobb'd him, so that he sunk down dead, and then taking his Signet
and his Keys he got away unespyed, and hasted to the Gentleman's House, where
meeting with his Wife, he told her that her Husband had received Orders
instantly to depart for the Duke of Burgundies Court, and that she must send
the Jewels, by the same token there was his Signet and his Keys of his Cabinet,
which the Gentlewoman taking of Andrew, went and unlocked the Cabinet, and, not
finding the Jewels there, returned and told him, that her Husband must come and
look them himself; for they were not there: upon this Andrew departed much
perplexed that he had missed of his aim, and long time he Pondered whether he
should return to Jeronimus, or fly; during which space, Jeronimus coming into
his Hall, perceived blood to drop through the Sealing, and thereupon commanded
his Servants to run up and find out the cause, where they no sooner came but
they found the Gentleman Murdered, at which they were much amazed, and hasted
down to relate the same to their Master: who took an hateing that any such
thing should be done in his House, and knew not what to do in the business as
being but a stranger in England, and not well acquainted with the Laws.

CHAP. V.
How Andrew returned to Jeronimus's House and disposing of the dead body,
afterward made his escape; and how the Murder being found out, Jeronimus and
all his Servants were Imprisoned.

WHilst the whole Family were in great perplexity about the Murder, in came
the Villain that acted it, to whom Jeronimus said; O thou wicked wretch! what
mischief have thou done in Murdering an Innocent Gentleman in my House; not
so, replied Andrew, for he was a very Cutthroat, and would have stabbed me, in
hopes of getting some Treasure which he supposed I had in a Trunk which I
opened; but now the business is past, it cannot be recalled, be therefore
advised by me, show no sad Countenance, nor cause of Grief: for I will so
dispose of the Body, that it shall never be found hereafter, and if any are
Inquirers for the Person, you must tell them that he departed from your House
about an hour after dinner, and that since that time he returned not. And
thereupon Andrew took up the Body, and bringing it down stairs, threw it into
the Privy with the Head downwards, and then gave order for the washing away the
Blood, after which, understanding that Jeronimus had a design to apprehend him;
he privily got over a back wall and so made his escape, woodcut of Andrew
carrying a dead man over his shoulder; woodcut repeated on p. 41 not staying
till he came to Venice, where he became a Rower in a Gally or Pirate: and a
while after renounced the Christian Religion.

The Gentleman being two days missing at Court, many began to wonder, and the
third day acquainted the King thereof, who began to mistrust: that the great
value of his charge might have made him false though otherwise, a Gentleman of
undoubted Reputation and Fidelity; upon which a Messenger was sent to his House
to Inquire for him, and was informed by his Wife, that she had not seen him in
three days: but that at his departure he went in the Company of a Florentine,
who pretended to have great store of Jewels at the House of one Jeronimus
Roberti a Florentine, Merchant in Lombard Street, and that a while after their
departure, the same person came with her Husbands Keys and Ring, desiring her
to send the Jewels, but she looking for them in his Cabinet, found them not
there.

With this answer they returned to the King, who was greatly displeased, but
that he might not seem over rashly to censure the Fidelity of the Knight,
although he concluded he was fled, he gave order that nothing more should be
done in it till the end of two days, in which space Fortunatus returning from
on Shipboard (where he had been taking an account of the ladeing) perceived
not only his Master, but all his fellow Servants very melancholy; upon which,
he demanded of the Maid what was the cause of such their sudden alteration, to
whom she answered (as having beforehand premeditated an excuse) that her
Master had received a Letter of the Death of a dear Friend of his, which had
occasioned that sadness in him; and that with him the rest Simpathized as is
the Custom of their Country, but that he not being his near Relation, he would
not go into Mourning for him, with which Fortunatus was well pleased. But now
the two days being expired, and no tidings of the Gentleman; the King in a
great rage sent his Pursevants to search his House, who broke open as many
Trunks, Chests and Cabinets, as they found locked, in it found not the Jewels:
upon which, at the Supplication of the Gentlewoman (who said she verily
believed her Husband was Murdered) they went to the House of Jeronimus, where
having the Kings Warrant, they apprehended him and all his Family upon
Suspicion of Murder, but they all denied it, saying: Indeed there was such a
man there, but that he departed thence in the Company of the Person who brought
him thither, and that since they saw him not: but this excuse availed not, for
they all (being nine in number, of which Fortunatus was one) were delivered to
the Sheriffs, who carried them to Newgate, where they were kept asunder, and
were strictly examined, but they all declared as before: as for Fortunatus, he
was ignorant of the matter and therefore could not confess, upon which the
Sheriffs were ordered to search Jeronimus's House, the which they accordingly
did, and looked in all the Chests, Trunks, Closets, Cellers, Pantries and
Stables, but found not the dead Body, and so were about to depart, when one
amongst the rest having a Torch in his hand, lighted some Paper and threw it
down into the Privy, whereby reason of the shallowness of the Ordure, the Legs
of the party Murdered appeared, he being cast in with his Head downward, which
he no sooner perceived by the Light, but he called to the rest, telling them
that he had found the Murdered Corpse, and thereupon they all coming together
drew it out, and after having cleansed it with Water, they laid it in the
Street before the Door of Jeronimus, for to be seen of all People, who with
great Detestation and shaking of their Heads abhorred the Fact: as also a
Messenger was sent to acquaint the King what they had found, upon which he gave
order for the Racking Jeronimus, and the rest, to force them to confess where
the Jewels were, for he supposed that they had Murdered him for the Jewels;
when they being stretched upon the Rack, and in exceeding torment, confessed
the true manner of the Murder as it is before recited. But Fortunatus,
although he was tormented with the rest, could not give any account of the
Murder by reason of his absence when the Fact was committed; but as for the
Jewels, they all protested they knew not any thing of them.

CHAP. VI.
How Jeronimus Roberti, and seven of his Servants were Hanged for the Murder,
and how Fortunatus was saved at the Place of Execution.

NOtwithstanding they made their Confession, how and upon what casion the
Murder was Committed, it availed them nothing; for the King issued out a
Commission to try them, where cheir own Confessions and the finding of the
Murdered Corpse in the House being proved against them they were found Guilty,
and being Condemned, were shortly carried to the Place of Execution; a pair of
woodcut of nine men and a king at the gallows Gallows being built for that
purpose, where they were urged to Confess where the Jewels were, but they
declared they never saw them, nor could they give any account of them. So that
first Jeronimus was turned off, and then an other, so one after another till
none were left but the Cook and Fortunatus, who now began to make a thousand
wry faces, as giving themselves over for gone, but when the Cook came to be
turned off, he desired to speak a word or two, which was the readyer granted
because they supposed he might tell what was become of the Jewels; but silence
being made, he said Fortunatus was altogether innocent of the Fact as being
abroad about his occasions when it was done, and that he knew not of the Body
being in the Privy, by reason they all concealed it from him; and therefore if
he did dye, he dyed innocently and wrongfully. At the hearing of this, the
People prevailed so far with the Sheriff, as to stay till the King might be
Advertized of what had been related; who upon the hearing thereof, and at the
earnest Suit of some Ladys (who had cast their Eyes upon Fortunatus, and seeing
him a goodly Youth, were moved to pity him) the King sent his Mandate to the
Sheriff to save his Life; who thereupon, after he had fastened the rest in
Chains to the Gallows, brought back Fortunatus, and in a while after set him at
Liberty.

At that time also the King commanded Jeronimus's House to be spoiled, where
every one took what best liked him; of which the rest of the Florentines
hearing they were sore afraid, and least the Multitude who were greatly
incenced against them should break into their Houses and spoil them also, they
laid their Heads together and at last concluded to raise a considerable Sum
of Money and lend to the King to regain his good Affection toward them, upon
which they were received into Favor, and a Proclamation put out in their
behalfs, forbiding any to abuse them, but that they should let them freely
Traffic as before.

CHAP. VII.
How afterward all the ^ewels were found by the Widow of the Murdered
Gentleman, and by her restored to the King.

AFter the Execution, the King supposing the Murderer to have carried away the
Jewels he put forth his Proclamation; offering 1000 Crowns to any that would
discover them or return them again. Further, he sent to all the noted deellers
in the neighboring Kingdoms, to stop any such Jewels if they should be offered
to be sold; but after all this they were found under the bed of the Murdered
Gentleman; the manner of their being discovered was thus. About a Month after
the Murder the Gentleman being decently buried, several of the Neighbors came
to Comfort the Disconsolate Widow, and perceiving her still to be troubled for
the loss of her Husband, one amongst the rest who was in the same condition
with her but of a merrier temper, bid her cheer up, and by thinking of the
Livsng put the Dead out of her Remembrance, telling her that the best way to do
it, was to remove her Bed into an other Chamber, so that the Remembrance of
past pleasures might be forgot, and that by fixing her thoughts upon some lusty
young Lover, the Remembrance of her Dead Husband might be done away, adding
that she had done the same, and found the greatest Consolation therein; but the
Gentlewoman replied, O how shall I forget so good a Husband, who tendered me as
dear as his Life? had he been bad I might have done it; yet after their
departure she went to remove her Bed, and had scarce drawn it two foot, but
under it she espied a little Casket the which she took up, and having opened
it, she (to her great joy) found all the Jewels therein; and thereupon sent to
a Kinsman of hers whom she could best trust to ask his advice how she should
bestow them, and when he came, she first told him the manner of her finding
them, and afterward showed them to him; who after some consideration, advised
her to carry them her self to the King, saying, that if they were offered to be
sold they would be stoped, and then her Life might come in danger: to this
advice of her Cosins she gladly consented, so that away thy went, and after
some Attendance got to be admitted into the Kings presence, where kneeling
before him, she said, Most Gracious Liege, I am come humbly to present you with
the Jewels, for which my dear Husband lost his life. As I was removing my Bed
this day, I found them under it, and with that she delivered the Casket, which
the King opening and perceiving they were all there, he greatly rejoiced;
saying, Forasmuch as you have been thus faithful, you shall not go unrewarded:
As for the loss of your Husband, I, as well as you are not a little grieved,
therefore to repair the loss I will choose you another; and thereupon called a
Knight, and commanded him to marry her, the which the Knight consenting to, as
not being willing to disoblige the King the Ceremonies of their Marriage was
celebrated in the Kings presence; and now said the King, I Endow you with my
Manor of Woodstock, with a Thousand pounds a year to continue Yours during
both your Lives, and thereupon he dismissed them: so that the Bride departed
joyful that such good Fortune had befallen, and went to all her Gossips to
acquaint them with the same, giving the Widow many Thanks for her seasonable
Advice, saying, If she had not removed the Bed, the Jewels might have stood
there time out of mind, telling her that she would always make use of her
Counsel for the future.

CHAP. VIII.
How Fortunatus having got over Sea lost himself, in a Wood in France; and of
his Encountering with, and killing a wild Bear that came to devour him.

THe dread of Hanging and his narrow Escape, so terrified Fortunatus, that he
did not think himself safe so long as he trod upon English Ground: Whereupon he
made what haste he could to pass the Seas, so that having got on Board a Ship
in which his dead Master used to Trafick, she set Sail for France, where they
set him on shore; and now he being Moniless, thought the best way was to get
him a Master, but after a long Inquiring, finding none that would Entertain
him, he resolved to Travel further; when being belated in a large Forest, where
few Passengers traveled, he struck out of the Road into a Cross-way, which led
him into further Inranglements: for not being able to find any end of the Wood,
when Evening came, he sat him down and began to lament himself, being both
Hungry and a Thirst; yet there he sat, not daring to sleep for fear of the
wild Beasts, which he heard make hidious noise from many parts, and who in the
Night usually range for Prey; but that Night escaping any Encounter with them,
the next Day he got up and went onwards, but at last was so entangled in the
Thickets, that he could hardly go either backwards or forwards; but at last he
found some Water, of which, drinking freely out of his Hat, he made his Dinner
of Berries and Cornel, and so passed over that day.

The next Night the Moon began to shine, and as he was sitting, and greatly
bewailing his Condition, he heard a rustling in the Leaves, looking up he
perceived a huge Bear coming toward him, whose ugly sight did not a little
terrify him; whereupon to avoid her fury, he got up the Tree that stood next
him, thinking to continue repetitive woodcut of single tree woodcut of
Fortunatus stabbing a bear with a sword there till such time as the Bear was
passed by, but she having espied him, began to climb the Tree after him, and
withal made such a hidious noise, that she caused several other Beasts to
repair thither; The Bear having got up the hardest part of the Tree, pursued
Fortunatus still as he climed higher, the which he perceiving, plucked up a
Courage, and drawing his Sword, was resolved to stand to it Manfully,: The Bear
came at him with open Mouth. and he still as she reached at him with her Paws,
wounded her in one place or other, till at length she fell down, and in the
fall was so bruised, that she lay as dead; which Fortunatus perceiving, and
well noting that all the other Beasts were withdrawn, he came down, and thrust
his Sword into the Bears Heart, after which being almost starved with Hunger,
he flead part of her, and cutting off some of her Flesh eat it, by which being
strengthened, he the next Morning got up, and resolved to search his way out;
when at last coming into the great Road where he was at first, he met with a
Walloon, who directed him the nearest way; insomuch that in an hours Traveling
he got out of the Forest and came to the City of Orleance, where he met with
some refreshment, but had like to have paid dear for his coming thither, as in
the next Chapter will appear.

CHAP. IX.
How Fortunatus falling asleep in a Porch in the City of Orleance had a bloody
Knife put into his Sleeve, and how he being found with it was accused of the
Murder of a Gentlewoman, and narrowly escaped; the Person that did the Murder
being broken upon the Wheel for the same.

IN the City of Orleance in the Kingdom of France, lived one James D'Bret a
rich Merchant, who had a fair and beautiful young Gentlewoman to his Daughter,
named Mary D'Bret, who being a considerable Fortune, had many Suitors, and
amongst the rest, a Merchant of the same place, whose Name was Anthony
Montples; it is true, he was a very comely Gentleman, but being young he was
drawn away by lude Company to all manner of Extravagancies, which made the
Father of the Damsel that he would not hearken to the giving him his Daughter,
although the Maid could have been well content to have loved him for his
Person, but being charged by her Father upon his Blessing and the Ties of her
Obedience, not to permit his farther Addresses, she not only gave him his
Answer at his next coming, but also would not from that time forward admit him
to see her, unless by accident he met her in the Street, and then as much as in
her lay she would shun him, which made him turn his former Love into Hatred,
and the studdy of Revenge; insomuch that within awhile after, he having certain
notice by some of her Servants (whom he bribed to send him word how things went
from time to time) that within two days she was to be Married to a Knights
eldest Son, who lived at a Village about four Miles from the City: He being
moved by the Instigation of the Devil, resolved to hinder the Match whatever it
cost him, and thereupon he disclosed his Mind to one Saggue a bloody Villain,
and one with whom he often kept company; who advised him, that since the
Gentlewoman had proved false to him in breaking her Promise, and now was
resolved by marrying another to frustrate all his hopes, it was but just that
since he could not enjoy her himself, to hinder any other from doing the same;
for says he, It will surely grieve you to think what pleasure your Rival
enjoyes, whilst you suffer pain and torment; nay more, to think how they will
flout and jeer you at their Merry-makings, and often laugh you to scorn for
being so foolish to beflow upon her such liberal Gifts, and all to no purpose;
nay, and that your Rival should have them at his dispose.

This so inflamed Montpess, that he could afterward talk of nothing but
Revenge, and thereupon secretly agreed with this bloody Varlet for 200 hundred
Crowns to make her away, either by stabbing, poisoning, drowning, or
strangling; so that being furnished with fit Instruments of Death, Saggue went
to wait about her Lodging for a fit Opportunity, but finding she came not out,
he got on a Serving-mans Habit, and having written a Letter in the Name of the
Knights Son to whom she was suddenly to be married, he came in the dark of the
Evening and knocked at the Door, which the Maid opening, demanded his Business,
who told her that he came from such a Gentleman with a Letter, and some rich
Presents which he had order to deliver to none but her Masters Daughter; upon
which the Wench went up and acquainted her what the Messenger had said: So that
the innocent Lady not dreaming her end was so nigh, came down, and taking him
aside into her withdrawing Room, ordered the Maid to bring a Glass of Wine, the
which after she had set down, she withdrew, as thinking they might have some
private talk which was not fitting for her to hear; when the Maid was gone, he
told the Gentlewoman a very formal Story, and then gave her the Letter which
she having opened, began to read; whilst he was feeling in his Pockets, as if
he had the Presents there that were specified in the Letter: But instead of
Presents, he drew out a Knife secretly, and perceiving the Coast clear, whilst
she was reading, he with full force struck it to the Haft in her Breast, upon
which giving a shriek she fell down down dead, which the Murderer perceiving,
he hasted thence, but had scarcely passed the outward Gate, when the Father of
the Damsel coming by, espied her weltring in her Gore, at which he raised such
a doleful Exclamation, as Alarmed all the House; whereupon pursuit was
immediately made after the repetitive woodcut of single tree woodcut of
murderer planting knife on Fortunatus Murderer, who by this time had got
ground, and by that means he had some time to look about him; when in a Porch
he espying Fortunatus asleep, upon which he taking the bloody Knife wherewith
he had done the Villainy, he put it into Fortunatus his Sleeve, and so departed.

Now by this time the whole City was Alarmed with the piteous Outcries of the
Servants, who were upon the pursuit of the Murderers, who ran here and there
searching and inquiring, as not being certain by reason of the many turnings
which way he fled; when at last one of them coming to the Porch where
Fortunatus lay still asleep, he cried out, Here he is, here he is, I have found
him, I have found him; for indeed Fortunatus had the bad Luck to have a Suit of
Clothes on at that time not unlike to the Murderers, by which the Maid that
let him in described him to the rest.

At the Noise and Outcries they made, Fortunatus suddenly awoak, when starting
up in a great Amazement, the Knife dropped out of his Sleeve, which they taking
up, and perceiving to be still bloody, they concluded absolutely that he had
murdered their Mistress; and thereupon dragging him through the Streets,
railing upon him, and threatening him with a thousand Deaths, without giving him
the least knowledge what it was for, when they were come before the Magistrate,
they declared what had happened, showing the Knife they had found about him, the
Maid likewise swore it was he; whereupon the people cried out, Hang him, hang
him: Insomuch that though he pleaded Innocence, and made many Excuses, he could
not be heard but away he was sent to Prison, and laid in Irons, and in a short
time after was condemned to be broke upon the Wheel; when it so chanced that
three days before the Murderer was apprehended on suspicion of another
Murder which he had committed; for which being extremely wracked and at the
point of Death, he did not only confess that, but this also for which
Fortunatus was to suffer, telling the manner, and what induced him to do it,
and how that upon his flight he found Fortunatus, and put the Knife into his
Sleeve as he slept: This Confession coming to the Judges Ear, he gave order to
stay Execution two days longer, and in the mean time sent for the Murderer
and Fortunatus, as likewise the Maid who had seen him, and setting them both
before her, bid her tell which was the Murderer; upon which after some pauze,
she said, She now well perceived she had been mistaken as to what she had
before sworn to, in relation to Fortunatus, avowing the other to be the man,
and that she not only knew him, by his voice, but by a Scar in his Face, and he
being no longer able to conceal his Guilt, he told them all the Passages how he
came to the Gentlewoman with a forged Letter, the which he wrote himself, and
how he was hired for 200 Crowns by Montpess, upon which the Letter being there,
the Judge ordered him to write again, the which he did; and then they being
compared, it plainly appeared to be his hand: Whereupon the Judge thanked God
who had made such a seasonable discovery of the Truth, and thereupon sent and
apprehended Montpess, who finding the other, and confessed the whole Matter,
for which within a short time after Montpess was beheaded, and broken upon the
Wheel; but Fortunatus set free, and the people that a little before had
Exclaimed against him, pitied him for his wrongful suffering, and thereupon
made a Purse amongst themselves, and gathered him Sir Crowns, the which he
taking very thankfully, departed the City, giving praise to God who had so
miraculously wrought his Deliverance.

CHAP. IX.
How Fortunatus traveling through a Forest, was met by Dame Fortune, and how
she gave him a Purse that continually supplied his Expenses.

FOrtunatus being got out of the City of Orleance, took his way toward Paris,
when traveling through a huge Forest, he on his right hand perceived a
beautiful Creature in female Habit, sitting under a broad spreading Beech-tree
with a Vail over her Eyes, who as he came near, arose and crossed him in his
way, at which he rejoiced not a little, for he had thought there had been
naught but Bears and wild Beasts in the place, but looking steadfastly upon her
he began to ponder whether she might not be a Fary, or bodily shape composed by
Delusion: But whilst he was in this doubt, she taking him by the Hand, gently
asked him whether he was going, upon which he told her, desireing her that she
would accompany him out of the Wood.

To which she replied, she might not go with him, but that she would do more
for him than any on earth had ever done: Whereupon Fortunatus gave her many
thanks, and desired to know her Name, and what she was, and her Business, in so
desert a place; to whom she answered, my Name is Fortune, and here I am placed
by him who made all things, and therefore has power to dispose of them as it
best pleases him: by his Commission I am here placed, to distribute Six
things, according as the Influence of the Stars by his appointment does direct:
the which are these; Wisdom, Health, long Life, Beauty, Strength, and Riches:
and now is the Moment of Choice, therefore make no delay, for in this case the
Opportunity being over-slipped, returns not again in an Age: Be free, and take
for asking any of these which shall seem most pleasing to you.

At this unexpected Offer, Fortunatus inwardly rejoiced, and stood not long to
pau^e, but said, Then if it be in my power to choose, give me Riches, even in
such abundance, that I never more may be reduced woodcut of Fortunatus meeting
Dame Fortune repetitive woodcut of multiple trees to poverty: to which Fortune
replied, Thy wish is granted; and thereupon she gave him a Purse, saying, Take
this as the Gift of Providence, the Virtue of it being, that in what Country
soever you shall hereafter be, when at any time you shall put your hand into
the same, you shall find 10 Pieces of Gold of the current Coin of that Nation
where you are, and so it shall continue to do during your life, and the life of
your Sons, but no longer, This more and more rejoiced Fortunatus, insomuch that
he returned her a thousand Thanks, wherefore she rebuked him, saying, That he
ought not to thank her for what he had received, but God Almighty, from whose
liberal Bounty to the Sons of Men all good things flow, as for me, said she, I
am but the Dealer of good Things, and that I do by chance, for I neither see
nor have regard to the persons on whom I bestow them, but am always hoodwinked
as you now behold me; therefore had Wisdom been your Portion, she would have
taught you far otherwise, even to have rendered thanks where they are most
justly due; yet what thou have so freely received, bestow part upon the Poor as
thou shall see occasion.

This said, Fortunatus bowed low, and promised to perform all she had commanded
him: And as for this Day I will yearly keep it Sacred, and Liberally bestow
Alms; nay, I will moreover bestow a large Portion on some unmarried Virgin, in
order to her being disposed of in Marriage: Then he desired her to lead him out
of the Wood, which she promised, and thereupon ordered him to follow her; when
as she led him into a great Road, and willed him to go straight forwards,
neither turning to the right or the left, nor so much as to look back to see
what was become of her; whenas she no sooner parted from him, but she vanished:
Then Fortunatus traveling about three hours, came to the end of the Wood,
where lifting up his eyes, he beheld a fair House, and being desirous to
refresh himself there, for he perceived it was an Inn, he put his hand into his
Purse, to try if what had been related, were true, and thereupon pulled out 10
Pieces of Gold, at which he greatly rejoiced and entering the Inn, called for
Meat and Drink of the best; and by reason the Host began to misteust him, as
being mean in Apparel, he pulled out two Crowns and gave him them beforehand,
whereupon the Host joyfully spread the Table with such choice Provision as the
House would affoard.

CHAP. X.
How Fortunatus at his Departure from the Inn, bought three fair Horses which
Earl Rodolphus had before cheapned, for which he was Imprisoned, and narrowly
escaped his life.

WHen Fortunatus had fufficiently taken his Repast, and therewith greatly
refreshed himself after three days continuance in the Inn, he perceived in the
Stable exceeding rich Trappins, with all manner of Furniture for a Horseman,
and demanded of his Host to what or whose Horse they did belong, to none says
the Host, for they are left here to be sold; then said Fortunatus, what is the
Price of them; 50 Crowns said the Host, Here is your Money said Fortunatus; and
so taking them, he departed; when traveling forwards some distance thence, he
espied a great Village with a Castle in it, standing upon a Hill, and thither
he repaired with all speed, as hoping there to light of a good Horse, the which
in his former Inn he could not do; when he came thither, he asked for the best
Inn in the Town, and being directed to it, he sat him down, and casted for
Provision, which his Host brought him, then falling into discourse, he asked
him, whether he knew not of any good Horses that were to be sold thereabouts,
to which the Host replied, that there were three exceeding fair Horses which
had been lately brought to that Town by a Merchant, intending to dispose of
them at the Entertainment that was to be made by the Duke of Orleance, upon the
account of his Wedding with the fair Issabella, Daughter to the King of
Arragon; then was Fortunatus desirous to see them, but the Host told him that
the Earl Rodolphus had bidden 300 Crowns for them, and that the Merchant
refused to take under 300 Crowns; no matter for the Price, said Fortunatus, if
so I but like them; and thereupon he desired his Host to go with him to the
place where they were, which he did, and smiled as he went, to think how he
should lose his labor, for he did not imagine Fortunatus had Money to purchase
them; but coming to the Merchant after having well viewed them, Fortunatus drew
out the Money, and paid it down, and had the Horses delivered to him, the
which he and his Host conveyed to the Inn, where he gave order for rich Saddles
to be made, and such Furniture as was wanting, desiring the Host likewise to
hearken out for two trusty Servants, whom he would furnish with all things
necessary; but whilst he was making these Preparations, the Earl sent as much
Money as was demanded for the Horses: When finding that they were gone, he grew
exceeding angry, and sent again to enquire who he was that durst buy them out
of his hands; and having understood at what Inn they were, he sent his Servants
thither, who coming to the Host, demanded if such Horses were in his Stables;
to which he answered, Yes: Then said they, our Lord has sent to know the man
that durst to buy them out of his hands; Why truly said the Host, he is a
stranger and came in by accident; when amongst other things, he asked me,
whether any good Horses were to be sold thereabouts? and accordingly I told
him; but did not think by his Garb he was able to buy an Ass: As for Furniture
he brought it with him, but how he came by it, I know not. Nay, said the
Servant, in all likelihood he has robbed and murdered some Gentleman upon the
Road, and thereupon he departed in a great rage.

CHAP. VII.
How the Earl caused Fortunatus to be apprehended, and cast into Prison, till
he gave an account how he came by his Money; and was obliged to deliver the
Horses, and Three hundred Crowns.

THe Earl having notice of all that had passed, sent immediately to apprehend
Fortunatus in his Inn, who then by the Counsel of his Host, was preparing to
depart; but having seized ^im, they brought him before their Lord, who after
many reproachful words, demanded whence he was. and how he came by so much
Money, as to buy such high prized Horses out of his hands: As to the First, he
answered, That he was the Son of a poor Courtier of the City of Famagosta in
the Isle of Cyprus: As to the second, he said, What Money he had, he came
honestly by it, and therefore ought not to be questioned about it, unless any
could prove to the contrary; adding, that he never yet wronged any body of one
Farthing: But the Earl angerly told him, that it was not likely such a Fellow
as he should have so much Money, unless he had robbed or murdered some person
for it; and thereupon ordered him to be fastened to the Rack, in order to force
him to a Confession; yet he resolved rather to suffer the worst Extremity, than
to confess the secret Virtue of his fortunate Purse; but being put to exceeding
Torture, he desired them to take him from off the Rack, and he would confess;
the which they did, and brought him before the Earl from out the Prison, where
when he had first begged Mercy, he said, As I Yesterday was traveling in a
Forest, so chanced, that I found a Purse with 620 Crowns in it: In what Forest,
said the Earl? A Forest about four Miles from this place; Why you Varlet, then
said the Earl with a stern Countenance, will you rob me of my Right? for know,
that I am Lord of the Forest, it and that whatever is found there, appertains
to me: I knew not that said Fortunatus, and therefore humbly crave your pardon;
but said the Earl, you shall be made to know it e're you depart, and therefore
first tell me what is become of the Purse and Money? As for the Purse, replied
Fortunatus, I took the Money out of it, and threw it into a Brook that runs
through the Forest; but if it should please your Honor to take the rest of the
Money, here it is: That shall not serve, said the Earl, for I will not only
take your Money, but your Life; and therefore against to Morrow prepare for
your Execution.

This made Fortunatus exceeding sad, and began to wish that he had chosen
wisdom instead of riches, by which he easily might have escaped such troubles,
but seeing that power and tyranny would have its way, fell upon his Knees, and
with tears besought the Earl to spare his ^ife, and take both the Horses and
the Money; for, said he, what will it avail you to take away my Life that am
such a miserable Creature? but if you spare me, I shall ever extole your
Clemency and Goodness.

This and the entreaty of the Earls Servants, but especially the Countesses
Gentlewomen, moved him to relent, so that having taken an Oath of him never to
discover what had passed, he gave him two Crowns back, and sent his servants to
see him out of Town, where they left him; at which Fortunatus did not a little
rejoice, forasmuch as he had his dear Companion the Purse to bear him company,
then having abjured ever coming within that Earls Jurisdiction any more, he
departed toward Britain; and after some time, came to Angiers, a considerable
City of that Dukedom, where at that time was held a great Feast, in Honor of
the Marriage of the Dukes Daughter with the Prince of Saxony; upon which
occasion a great number of Lords and others, were come thither gallantly
attended: upon which, Fortunatus notwithstanding his late bad success by
dealing in horse flesh, bought three more horses and put himself in a splendid
Equipage, and likewise hired two servants, and betook himself to the best Inn,
where he kept company and conversed with the best, and so continued in great
splendour till the Celebration of the Marriage.

CHAP. XII.
How an Irish Gentleman was entertained by Fortunatus as his Companion, and
what befell them in their Travels.

WHilst Fortunatus continued at this City, he spent most part of his time in
seeing the pastimes which were made as Pompous Shows, Masks, Dancing, Tilt,
Turnament, and many other Noble Exercises; and so being used every day to
depart from the Inn with his men, the Host began at last to mistrust he would
give him the slip as some others had done, and thereupon acquainted him with
his thought, at which Fortunatus smiling, put his hand into his Purse, and
pulled out a hundred Crowns, the which he gave to the Host: saying, here honest
fellow take this, and when thou think we have had as much as it comes to ask
for more, I shall not be very inquisitive to know the account.

At this the Host began to look very pleasant ever after, showing great respect
to Fortunatus, setting him at the upper end of the Table, and handing him the
choicest dishes of meats, and best wine; though several Noble Persons eyes were
present.

Not long after, as he was sitting at dinner with six Earls and ten Lords,
besides other Gentlemen of good fashion; several Musitianers came and offered
to play before them, telling them that they had been Gentlemen, but where now
fallen to decay, and were forced to take up that employ for their living; when
they had played a good while, an Earl at the Table asked one of them that was
more likely than the rest, what Countryman he was? who replied that he was an
Irishman, and had spent all his Estate in traveling; for, said he, I have been
in most parts of the World, and can name, and have seen most of the Emperors,
Kings, and Sovereign Princes in Europe, Asia, and Africa; and can discribe the
Splendour of their Courts, the manners and customs of their Countries, and speak
most Languages, with many other things.

Then they asked him his name, who told them he was called Leopaldus, and came
of a worshipful Family, which appeared no less in his Carriage and portly
Demeanor; upon which the Nobility and Gentry being moved to Compassion, that
so goodly a person should be reduced to poverty, they liberally distributed
Money amongst him and his Companions, and desired him to stay and attend them
whilst the Feast continued; for which, not only he, but the rest returned
their Honors a thousand thanks: Then one of the Earls asked him if he would be
willing to live with him, and become a Tutor, and he should never want; but he
excused it, saying, He had left a Wife and Children in his own Country, which
he much longed to see.

Now Fortunatus who had curiously obferved the Man, began to think with
himself, could I but procure him for my Companion in Travel, I should think my
self happy; and thereupon when Dinner was ended, he sent privately for him to
come to his Chamber, where when he entered, Fortunatus Saluted him after the
most courteous manner, and told him that he was minded to spend the residue of
his Days in Travel, and that if he would become his Companion, he would so
provide for him, that he should ever have plenty; as likewise provide a Horse
for himself, and another for a man who should wait on him.

To this Leopaldus replied, That he could be well content with such a Proffer,
if it were not that he so much longed to see his Wife and Children, which had
been the occasion of his return out of far Countries; to which Fortunatus
answered him, That if he would make him a solemn promise, that he would
afterward accompany him, he would go with him into Ireland first, and bear his
Charges thither, and then we will return to Cyprus the Isle wherein I was born,
and so from thence by Sea and Land, travel into other Countries and Kingdoms as
thou shall think best fit.

At this Leopaldus inwardly rejoiced; but having known the exceeding Expense of
Travel, had thought with himself that Fortunatus could never be able to perform
what he promised; and thereupon told him, unless he had great Sums of Money, it
was in vain to undertake what he proposed: Let me alone for that, said
Fortunatus, for I shall have Money in all places where I come; If it be so,
said Leopaldus, and thou will perform thy promise, I am content; and thereupon
Leopaldus having a Horse provided for him, and another for his Man, which
Fortunatus caused to be hired: after the Host was discharged, they departed the
City, and so visiting many fair Cities and Towns, at last they came to Bruges
in Flanders, where taking Shipping they came for London, where having stayed
awhile, they departed for Scotland, still visiting all Places of note as they
passed; and from Scotland they Sailed over Sea into Ireland, where coming to
Londonderry, and from thence to Waldrink, where was his own House, he was not
known, by reason of the Alteration his long Absence had made; but finding his
Wife and Children all in good Health, he by many Tokens made them understand
who he was, to their no small Joy; the next day came thither Fortunatus and his
Men, who perceiving that Leopoldus was but slenderly provided, gave him a 100
Crowns, bidding him go and buy such Provision as was convenient, and Invite the
chief of his Neigbours to Dinner, the which he did, and very splendedly
Entertained them.

When Fortunatus had stayed there about a Month, he was desirous to be gone,
and acquainted Leopoldus with the same, giving him 2000 Crowns to leave with
his Wife and Children, and so after Leave taken, and some Tears shed at
parting, Leopoldus went with Fortunatus; and as they journied, he told him of
S. Patrick's Purgatory which was in their way some Miles distant from Waldrink:
this made Fortunatus desirous to see; insomuch that when they came to the
Abbey, Leopoldus went to the Abbot, and told him that a strange Lord was
arrived there, and was very desirous to see S. Patrick's Purgatory, to which he
consented, provided the Fees were paid to those that kept it: which Fortunatus
not only did, but likewise presented the Abbot with a Cask of the best Wine
that could be got in the Town of Yernecks where the Abbey stood: So that in
requital the Abbot Invited him and Leopoldus to Dinner, and at their request
told them, that the Town wherein the Abbey stood was once a wild Desert or
Wilderness, and that one Patrick a Devout man, was wont to leave his Monastery
and resort thither to Prayers: When one day finding a large Hole in the Ground,
overgrown with Bushes, he entered therein, and finding the Inside more large
and spacious, all arched over with Pumice, and supported with Pillars of Earth;
he ventured yet further, when striking into a winding Path, he lost his way and
could not get out again, but was assaulted woodcut of monk unlocking door with
Fortunatus, Leopoldus, the Abbot and another figure standing behind him;
repeated on p. 79 repetitive woodcut of multiple trees with fierce Winds as hot
as the steem of a Furnace, and heard many doleful Cries and Groans; upon which
he fell upon his knees, and prayed God to deliver him out of that place, for
his Mercies sake, when as he was taken up and carried out of the away, he came
in; whereupon it was ever since called S. Patricks Purgatory, and this Abbey
builded in token of his Deliverance.

This made Fortunatus the more desirous to see it, and resting that Night, he
got up the next Morning, and having shrieved himself, and said his Prayers
devoutly, he, together with Leopoldus who offered to accompany him, went into a
Hole behind the Altar, to which there was a Door, and a pair of Stairs of
earth; when they were in, the Monks shut the Door after them, and prayed for
their happy return as they used to do for others that had gone in before them,
and withal admonished them not to venture too far, lest they were lost, as many
Pilgrims had been, who were not found again in three or four days.

Fortunatus and Leopoldus being in, went forwards about a 100 paces, and coming
into a narrow passage that they could go but one a breast, they turned so
often, that they at last were lost in the Labyrinth, not knowing when they went
backwards or when forwards, so that they continued wandering too and fro for the
space of two days, hearing loud Shrieks and Groans, and now and then felt hot
Flashes, which so amazed them, that they wished they had never ventured in; and
besides Hunger began to assault them very grievously, insomuch that Fortunatus
began to say, that now his Purse was useless, and that notwithstanding he had
Gold and Silver, yet that would not satisfy Nature, but that they must now
starve with Hunger; and thereupon they both fell upon their Knees, and made a
Vow, that if God would be pleased to deliver them this once, they would never
be so rashly venturous again.

Now the third Day came, and the Servants without being very impatient of their
Masters stay, called at the Mouth of the Hole, and held in lighted Torches, but
in vain; when as not only they, but the Abbot and Priests were in great
perplexity, as thinking Fortunatus and Leopoldus were either lost or dead;
insomuch that they began to fing Mass for their Souls, whenas the Abbot calling
an old man to mind who had measured the Hole with Ropes, he sent for him, and
willed him to go in and seek for two Gentlemen that had lost themselvest
therein; the which upon the Servants promise, that their Masters should give
him a 100 Crowns, he undertook; saying, if they were alive he would bring them
thence: Whereupon taking with him a lighted Torch, and a Pipe, he entered; but
that Torch soon went out, yet he passed on playing upon his Pipe; and after
having gone a thousand paces, began to hollow to them, who with faint Voices
answered, till at last he being directed by the Sound. came to them, and
informed them that he was come to fetch them out; and taking them by the hand,
bid them follow him, which they did with no small content; when they came out,
they were exceeding feeble, yet greatly rejoiced at their Deliverance: So that
when Fortunatus his men told him how they had agreed with the old man for a 100
Crowns, he gave him 200, and then ordaining a sumptuous Dinner, he Invited the
Abbot and the rest, and desired them to return God thanks for the great
Deliverance he had sent them, giving 200 Crowns amongst the Priests, and after
leave taken, departed; and taking Ship, set Sail for Calice, and from thence
went to Paris, and so over-land to Rome, seeing many Countries, and strange
things in their way.

CHAP. XIII.
How Fortunatus Traveled from Rome to Constantinople, and what befell him at
the Coronation of the Emperor.

FOrtunatus and Leopoldus having continued at Rome some time, to take notice of
the Splendour and Pomp of the Bishops Court, departed thence for Venice;
whereupon News had, that the Emperor of Constantinople, intended to Crown his
Son Emperor, by reason he was so old that he could not Weild the Government as
he ought,; the State of Venice resolved to send an Ambassador with several
Presents to congratulate his Establishment in the Empire: And now the Galleys
being ready, Fortunatus so ordered the matter with the Captain of one of them,
that he got leave for him and his Retinue to pass to Constantinople therein;
when after ten days Sail they came within sight of the City, and were met by
some of the Emperors Galleys who were sent to welcome them; and coming on shore,
the Ambossador had a stately House provided him; but as for Fortunatus,
Leopoldus, and their Men, they were forced to betake themselves to an Inn,
which proved ^one of the best; for the Host was a Thief, and usually watched
his opportunity to rob his Guests when they were sleeping, who dreamed of no
such matter; so that the Host perceiving Fortunatus to have great store of
Money, he resolved to make bold with some of it; and therefore in their absence
got into their Chamber through a private Door, and searched all about, but
found no Money; so that he concluded they carried it all about them, and so
resolved when they paid again, to watch where they put it.

A while after Fortunatus came to pay, and putting his hand under the Table,
pulled out Money, and gave it to L^^poldus to pay the Reckoning, that it might
not be perceived from whence he had it; so that the Host marking him well,
supposed it was hidden in his Clothes, and was resolved the next Night to put
in with him for a snack: Now Fortunatus in the midst of his Merriments
remembered the time was come wherein he was to perform his Vow made to Dame
Fortune, about bestowing 400 Crowns on a Virgin in Marriage; and thereupon he
called his Host, and asked him if he knew any honest man that had a fair
Daughter to bestow, and he would give her a Portion: the Host told him that a
Neighbor of his had one who was marrigable; upon which Fortunatus bid the Host
go to her Parents, and bid them bring her the next Morning; which the Host
neglected to do, saying, She was gone abroad, and would not return till late
the next Morrow-evening: the which he did, because they should not part with
their Money till he had put in for a share; so that when they were in Bed, and
sleeping soundly by reason they were tired the day before at the noble Pastimes
that were held in the City; about Midnight the Host came through his private
Door; and first coming to Leopoldus, he felt and soon found his Purse, and took
from thence 50 Ducats; then coming to Fortunatus, he felt his Purse likewise,
but not putting his hand into it, he could not perceive any Money; for such was
the Secret, that to all those that felt the outside, it felt empty; whereupon
the Host having cut it from off his Girdle, threw it under the Bed; and so
setting open all the Doors and Windows departed: when about the third Watch
Leopoldus awaked, and espying all the Windows open, called to his Servants, as
likewise to Fortunatus, fearing what had happened; when the Servants were
awakened, he chid them extremely for leaving open the Doors and Windows; but
they stoutly affirmed, that they shut them fast when they went to Bed: upon
which Leopoldus feeling for his Purse, found it gone; and calling to
Fortunatus, told him that he was robbed; Fortunatus starting up between sleep
and wake, found his Purse gone also; and thereupon he fell into such extreme
sorrow, that he swoonded away, which caused no small stir amongst the Servants;
so that the Host who all this while stood listening, came in, and angerly
demanded why they made such ado to trouble the whole House? Whereupon they told
him they were robbed; to which he replied, Like enough so, perhaps you have
Thieves amongst your selves, and have robbed one another: But when he beheld
Fortunatus in that condition, he also affisted to bring him to himself again,
telling them that they ought to have looked to their Doors and Windows at a
time when so many Thieves were abroad.

When Fortunatus came to himself, he was exceeding sorrowful; upon which the
Host asked him, how much Money he had lost? Who replied, not much; but that he
had lost a Purse with a Bill of Exchange in it worth 1000 Crowns, though it
would do them little or no good that had it; for they could not receive the
Money unless he gave his discharge. Now the Host that knew where the Purse was
become, bid him search about; for, said he, it may be thrown somewhere in the
Room, for few Thieves care for an empty Purse: Whereupon Fortunatus his Men
began to look about very diligently, and at last under the Bed espied the
Purse, which they took up, and delivered to their Master, who did not a little
rejoice that he had recovered it; but fearing least by its being cut from his
Girdle, it might have lost its Virtue, he secretly put it under the
Bed-cloaths, and then thrusting in his hand, drew out Money as formerly; then
he began to rejoice, and putting on his Clothes, caused a Fire to be made, and
Wine to be brought: when the Morning was far gone, his Horses being made ready,
he rode abroad, and in his way ordered Leopaldus and his Servants to stay at a
Tavern till he went to his Exchequer, and took Moneys thence sufficient for his
purpose; so that having bought Five new Purses, he put in one of them 100
Crowns, the which he gave to Leopoldus to buy Necessaries, and into the rest 10
Crowns apiece, the which he gave to his Men every one, bidding them be careful
of Thieves for the future; then went he and took out 400 Crowns; which he had
promised to bestow upon the Maid in Marriage, and so returned to his Inn, and
willed his Host to go again to the Parents of the Maid; which he did, and
finding her likewise at home, he told the Father upon what account he came,:
How that a Gentleman that lodged at his Inn, desired him to bring his Daughter
thither, and he would do good for her in order to procure her a happy Match:
but the old man thinking it was a Trap to get his Daughter thither to Debauch
her, would by no means consent; saying, That his Daughters Virginity was all
she had to set her off in Marriage, and if by any means she should lose that,
she would not only undo her self, but be a stain to all her Kindred; and said
he, I know there are many slippery Blades abroad, therefore I will not trust my
Daughter from home amongst them; but if the Gentleman has any good meaning, and
intends to see my Daughter, let him come to my house and he shall be welcome,
but to let her come to any Gentleman abroad, I will not.

At this the Host being much displeased, departed, and told Fortunatus all that
had passed, endeavoring to incense him against the Virgin, and to bestow his
Money upon some other; but Fortunatus very well approving of the Fathers blunt
and well-meaning, caused his Servants to make ready his Horse, and to attend
him thither; the Host being there when they came to the Door, the Host knocked
hard, and the good man opening the same; he told him, that since he refused to
let his Daughter come to the Gentleman, he was come to her: which the good
Woman hearing and perceiving his Splendid Equipage, she run and caused the
Wench to put on her best Clothes, and prick up her Ears after the best manner
she could; and so with as much trouble as it is to bring a Bear to the Stake,
brought her into the Room where Fortunatus was; who taking him to be a Prince
at least, fell down on her knees before him, but he gently raised her, telling
the Father on what account he came; therefore said he, if there be any
young man that is deserving of her hereabouts, let him come and I will give him
a good Portion with her. At which the Mother told him, Yes, there was a
Neighbors Son who loved her entirely, and would have wedded her long ago, had
not his Parents restrained him, by reason her Portion was no ways answerable to
his: Then Fortunatus asked the Maid, if she liked the Youth? to which she
replied, She would be ruled by her Parents, and what they thought fit should be
a law with her: Nay, nay, says her Mother, and it shall please yout Majesty,
she likes him well enough, and has upon my Faith and Troath a Months mind to
him, but that the Bagage is shame-fac'd: Then Fortunatus ordered the Youth to
be sent for, and found that they were of a fit age to be coupled; whereupon
Fortunatus asked him, if he could like to take that Virgin for his Wife, if he
would give her a Portion? to which he answered, With a very good will, if he
would give her any thing considerable; for I love her well enough, but dare not
marry her without a Portion, least my Friends should disinherit me: And then he
asked the Maid if she was willing, who modestly replied, Yes; then the Friends
being had, he sent for a Priest, who having joined them in Matrimony, he
delivered to the young man a Purse with 400 Crowns, who with many scrapings and
cringings received the same: He also gave Money to the Parents of the Maid to
buy them Clothes, and provide the Wedding-Dinner; for which they gave him a
thousand thanks, and praised God that had raised them up such a Friend in time
of need. Then Fortunatus departed to his Inn and went to Dinner; Leopoldus and
the rest not a little wondering how he came by so much Money.

CHAP. XIV.
How Leopoldus slew the Thievish Host, and how he and Fortunatus made their
Escapes afterward.

NOw the Feast being almost at an end, the Host began to Plot how he might come
in for some more money, as well-knowing Fortunatus would be gone as soon as the
Sports were over; and thereupon he resolved as formerly he had done, to come in
at the privy Door and rob them; but when he understood that they burnt Wax
Tapers all Night, he was somewhat fearful of being discovered: but had not long
cast about for a Project, but he found one; which was this: He getting in when
they were all abroad, bored holes in the Tapers, and putting Water therein,
stopped them close again; so that when Fortunatus and the rest after Supper
were gone to Bed, he watched till the Light went out, and then he entered the
Chamber as formerly; and came first to Leopoldus his Bed, where by his too much
tumbling the Clothes to find out his Money, he was waked; repetitive woodcut of
single tree woodcut of Fortunatus and Leopoldus in their beds, swords drawn
with the host falling next to Leopoldus' bed when as Leopoldus whose Sword lay
ready, espied him by the light of the Moon, he struck at him with such force,
that giving him a Cut over the Neck, he fetched a great groan and fell down
dead; then he called to the Servants, asking them why they had put out the
Lights? saying, Here are Thieves in the Room, therefore stand upon your Guards
and suffer none to go out: Upon this Fortunatus awoke and caused the Servants
to strike fire, the which no sooner appeared, but they found their Host
weltring in his blood, and gasping for life; whereupon they were sore abashed:
but especially Fortunatus, who said, O Leopoldus, what have thou done? now for
this Murder shall we be all hanged; had not we better have lost our Money,
than Life and Money both, as now in most likelihood we shall: To which
Leopoldus replied, that he did not doubt this was the Thief that robbed them
before, and that it not being light to discern who he smote, he knew it not to
be his Host; nor as it is, said he, is it any other than a Thief I have killed?
therefore if the truth were known, we should not be in danger. Nay, but replied
Fortunatus, We may say what we will, we shall not be believed in our own Case,
I have had experience of that once before; and he up and told him the Story of
the Murder in England, wishing secretly that some rich Merchant of the City
knew the Virtue of his Purse, that so he might get him with a great Sum of
Money to Bribe the Judge for his Delivery; but then, thought he, if he get such
an inestimable Treasure into his hands, he will not lightly part with it, but
rather incense the Judge to dispatch us, that he may enjoy the Treasure.

Whilst he was in these and such like Perplexities, Leopoldus bid him be of
good Courage; for, said he, I will soon rid you of your fear: I would you
could, said Fortunatus, and that I was far enough hence; why then said
Leopoldus follow my Advice, and in so doing you shall be safe before Night
comes again: Then Fortunatus and the Servants promised to do what ever he
should counsel them: Said he, whilst it is yet dark and none are stirring, let
the Body be conveyed into the Courtyard, and there cast it into the Well, and
afterward wipe up the blood; then all of you show merry and pleasant
Countenances, and so as soon as it is light we will pay our Reckoning and
depart: This they agreed to, and immediately two of the Servants took up the
Body and carried it to the repetitive woodcut of single tree woodcut of man
carrying a body over his shoulder; repeated from p. 12 Well, where they threw
it in head foremost, as Leopoldus had directed them, cleansing the Chamber of
the blood; and when it was Morning got up and ordered their Horses to be made
ready, being all very cheerful, after which they called for Wine, and paying
what they had had the day before, they gave to every one of the Servants two
Ducats, telling them they were sorry they had not the opportunity of drinking
with their Host; but notwithstanding they would shortly return and thank him
for his kindness: So the Servants dismissed them with many thanks, not dreaming
their Master's being murdered.

When they were got out of the City, they rod toward Turkey with all speed, not
stopping till they had rid about 30 Miles, and then only Baiting a little, they
set forward again, and were so swift to avoid pursuit, that they rod 100 Miles
that day; the next day they set forward again, and came to Achipania, a City
garrisoned with Turks, and governed by a Bashaw; there they were not fuffered
to pass through without a Passport from the Governor, which Leopoldus for 24
Crowns obtained: then had they an experienccd Guide allotted them, who had for
his Wages a Crown every day; this Guide conducted them to the Great Turks
Palace, and then, and not till then, could Fortunatus be out of fear lest he
should be pursued: here they stayed a Month to behold the Splendour and
Magnificence of a Palace which for Riches and stately Building surpassed the
Courts of all the Christian Princes, had they been united in one; but seeing
that they were for the most part Heathens, and consequently God's enemies, they
would have no Discourse, nor keep company with any of them: from thence they,
crossing the Country, passed through Bononia, Hungaria, Bohemia, Saxony,
Dalmatia, Swevia, Denmark, and many other places, viewing the Monuments and
stately Buildings as they passed, and at last went into Italy; where passing
through the Dukedoms of Millain, Florence, Ferrara, Mantua, and the Kingdom of
Naples, they at last came to Venice, which was then a place for Merchandise,
the Richest in the World; there he bought many costly Jewels, Pearls, Gold
Fringe, and Gold Imbroderies, with Velvet and other costly Stuff. Now after 16
years absence, resolving to return into his own Country to visit his Parents;
when he came to Famogosta, he heard they were dead, for which he greatly
sorrowed; and being showed the place of their Burial, he stately Monument to be
erected, with this Inscription; Under this Marble Pile these Victims lie,
Whose Names Death has not power for to destroy;
But unto after Ages they shall live,
And an Example to true Lovers give.
Famed Theodorus, Fortunatus's Father,
And beauteous Greciana his dear Mother
Lie here Entombed, their Bodies here do lie,
But their great Souls are wrapped above the Sky.


After this he built him a fair House, and entertained several Maidservants,
bought him a Coach and other things necessary; so that the Gentry began to
wonder how he came by such vast Sums of Money, when as all of them knew he
departed extreme poor.

CHAP. XV.
How Fortunatus, by the Kings Command, was married to fair Cassandra, Daughter
to the Lord Nemina.

WIthin a while after his Arrival in Cyprus, he purchased the greatest part of
his Fathers Estate, which was Sold and Mortgaged; then built he a fair Palace,
a Church and Chantry, with Houses for 12 Priests, endowing them with 1400
Crowns a year; made stately Parks, Gardens, Fountains, and Fish Ponds, with
many other rare Devices; Insomuch that most of the Noblemen of Cyprus were
proud of his Company, and many were very desirous to match their Daughters to
him: Insomuch that the King himself taking notice of it, and being in discourse
with the Lord Nemina, who had three fair Daughters; he asked him what he
thought if Fortunatus should request one of his Daughters in marriage? Why
truly, replied he, and it may please your Majesty, I do not think it fit, for I
perceive he has no great Estate, and although he has ready Money, he is so
prodigal both in Expenses and Building, that it cannot last long; and therefore
I believe your Majesty would not advise me to match any of my Daughters to him,
least, as his Father did, he at last should come to poverty, notwithstanding
his Riches: Indeed, said the King, he has built a fair Palace, and many other
stately Edifices, yet his Estate is not at all Impaired; for I have been
informed that he has Jewels by him worth 100000 Crowns, and yet he will not
sell one of them; therefore if you will take my Advice, offer him one of your
Daughters, and I will second the matter.

By this the Earl perceiving that Fortunatus was highly in the Kings Favor, he
said, Well, if it please your Majesty, I will commit my Daughters to your
dispose, and with whatever your Majesty shall do, I will be well satisfied: to
which the King answered, That since he reposed so much trust in him, he would
not only give her in marriage, but give her a Dowry likewise; and thereupon
ordered the Earl to send his three Daughters to the Queen: Whereupon he went
home and acquainted his Wife with what had happened, with which she seemed at
first displeased, but after he urged it was the Kings pleasure, she was
contented; and thereupon sent her three Daughters well attended, and in costly
Earbs to the Queen, who received them joyfully.

The King having notice that they were come, he sent for Fortunatus, telling
him, that he understood he had a design to take him a Wife, and that he being
loath any of base Extraction should possess so fair and costly a Building,
himself would, if he thought fit, provide him One of Noble Birth, and such an
One as he doubted not but would please him: Whereupon Fortunatus bowing low,
gave his Majesty many thanks, saying, That indeed he intended to seek out for a
Wife; but since his Majesty had so far condescended as to give himself the
trouble of providing him One, he would not look any further, but wholly submit
to what his Majesty thought fit: Then said the King, I have in my Palace three
fair Virgins, Daughters to the Lord of Nemina, of those you shall take your
choice; therefore say whether you will see them separate, or altogether: At
this Fortunatus paused not, but replied, If it may please your Majesty, I would
see them together, and hear them speak one after another; that you shall, said
the King; and thereupon sent one of his Pages to the Queen, to get the Ladies
in a readiness, for that he was to bring a Guest into the Presence Chamber; and
having notice that they were prepared, he took Fortunatus by the hand, who
likewise desired that Leopoldus might go with him, which the King consenting
to, they went all three together; when being come, the King sat down and
caused the Ladies to be brought before him, and placed in order according to
their years, the eldest being named Germania, the next Marcepia, and the
youngest Cassandra.

CHAP. XVI.
How Fortunatus havjng his choice of the Lord Nemina's three Daughters, chose
the youngest, whose Name was Cassandra, to whom he was married in the presence
of the King of Cyprus.

THe Ladies being placed in order, the King demanded of the eldest, whether she
had rather continue at Court and be one of the Queens Maids of Honor, or with
her Father and Mother; to which, with a modest Deportment, she answered; That
may it please my Sovereign Lord the King, it is not seemly that I should
dispose of my self, but rather that I submit to what your Majesty or my Father
shall think most convenient; then said the King to the next, tell me Marcenia
which from your heart you love best, the Earl your Father, or the Countess your
Mother: to which she replied, That is a hard Question, and therefore I must
humbly beg your Majesty's pardon to excuse me, if I answer not directly to this
Point; because I love them both so well, I know not how to incline to either
hand, and therefore must be silent as to my report in that Affair; then the
King said, Cassandra prithee tell me, should your Father and Mother be here,
and several young Nobles were dancing, and if your Mother should bid you Dance,
and your Father forbid the same, which would you choose to obey: Indeed my
Gracious Sovereign, said she, that Ouestion is unanswerable, especially upon
such short warning, and by one whose tender years are not capable of discerning
things as they are, for should I obey one, I should disobey the other, and on
either hand prove disobedient.

The King having asked them thus far, ordered them to withdraw; and then he
asked Fortunatus which he best approved of: truly my Gracious Lord, I like them
all so well, that on a sudden the Choice is difficult; therefore if your
Majesty will permit me to retire for an hours space to consult with my Friend
about the matter, I will return your Majesty an account of my Choice, which the
King consented to; and thereupon they retired into the withdrawing Room; where
Fortunatus asked Leopoldus what he thought, and how he would advise him to make
his Choice? but Leopoldus declined it, saying, That in matters of Love there
could be no direct Choice made but by the Party who was to enjoy the Lady; for
says he, What may seem most beautiful to me, may in your opinion seem
otherwise; and therefore pray excuse me in this particular: but when Fortunatus
urged, he said, Well, seeing you will have it so, do you sit at one end of the
Table, and I will sit at the other, and there we will write the Name of Her,
who we best like; you as you think fit, and I according to my opinion: This
pleased Fortunatus well, and when they had both written, they compared the
Names, and they were one and the same; so that Fortunatus sweetly rejoiced that
Leopoldus had approved of his Choice, and then went he joyfully to the King,
and told him he had chose Cassandra; whereupon the King ordered her to be
brought, and sending for his Chaplain instantly, caused them to be married,
though to the no little surprise of the Lady, woodcut of a split scene: seven
people around a table with three others in the balcony; the wedding of
Fortunatus repetitive woodcut of single tree who was not above 14 years of age,
and the rather by reason her Parents were absent at the Wedding.

After the Celebration of the Marriage, Fortunatus and his Bride were joyed by
the King, Queen, and Nobles, but the Sisters of Cassandra wept for madness that
their younger Sister should be chosen and they neglected; which Fortunatus
perceiving, comforted them in the best manner, and sent for his Casket of
Jewels which he had purchased at Venice, and after having presented the fairest
to the King and Queen; he bestowed the rest upon his Bride and her Sisters, as
likewise upon the Queens Ladys and Maids of Honor: he also sent Leopoldus with
a present of 1000 Crowns to the Countess of Nemina, as also to desire the Earl
to repair to Court. The Countess when she understood he had chosen her youngest
Daughter, whom she entirely loved, was somewhat displeased, but dissembling the
matter, she and the Earl come to Court in the most splendid manner they could:
and at their arrival were welcomed by the King and Queen, and all the Nobility;
as likewise by Fortunatus, who bestowed richer presents on them than before,
which quite dissolved the Countesses displeasure; insomuch that they thanked
God and the King, that they had provided her Daughter so brave and rich a
Husband, especially when she perceived how highly Fortunatus was in the Kings
Favor.

Then said the King; I think it convenient that the Wedding Feast be kept in
our Palace; nay, said Fortunatus, I beseech your Majesty let it be at my own
House in Famogosta; it would content me, said the King, that it should be
there, were it not for the excessive charge it will put you to; no matter for
that, said Fortunatus, for there is nothing that can be had in all the Isle of
Cyprus, but it shall be there at your Majesty's service; and if it shall please
your Majesty to ordein Tilts and Tournaments, I shall be exceeding glad, that I
may prove my self a man before your Majesty; to all this the King consented,
and ordered his Nobles to be ready within two days, to depart for Famogosta; as
likewise the Ladys that waited upon the Queen, and others: and for that day the
Bridegroom and Bride dined privately with the King and Queen.

CHAP. XVII.
How Fortunatus and his Bride, were accompanied by the King and Queen to
Famogosta, and what happened there, during the Wedding Feast.

FOrtunatus having the Kings consent to go with him to Famogosta; sent
Leopoldus with 2000 Crowns to buy provision for the entertainment, who so well
managed the matter, that at the Kings arrival all things were in a readiness;
there was he met in the great Court by all manner of Musicians playing
Melodiously, and entering the Hall, presented with Gorgious sights: brave
Dancing and Odoriferous smells, Seeling being frested with Silver Shells,
wrought in the Curiousest manner: and the sides of Cedar, Guilt with Gold; as
likewise several Lamps of Silver, burning Spicecy Oil, that cast a fragrant
smell.

When the Table was spread, the King, and all the Nobility wondered at the
store, saying, that they had not seen the like in Cyprus before, and all that
day continued they exceeding merry: but when night came, Fortunatus was
desireous to go to Bed with his Bride, for as yet he had not bedded her;
whereupon the King, Queen, Lords, and Ladys, accompanied them to their Chamber,
and there used such Diversion as is usual upon the Wedding Night; which made
the young Bride blush, but they retireing, left her to the embraces of
Fortunatus, who, it is to be supposed, in the like case would have been.

The Feast lasted 14 days, and then urgent business at Court calling the King
away, he sent for Fortunatus, as likewise the Earl his Father-in-Law, and the
Countess; and gave them all thanks for his entertainment, but the Countess
appearing somewhat Melancholy, the King asked the cause: when as she told him,
that she feared her Son-in-Law would soon waste all he had, so that her
Daughter would be reduced to Poverty; therefore she should not be content
unless he would settle some Dower in Land upon her; to which Fortunatus
replied, that he confessed his Lands were small, but as for ready money, I will
give 8000 Duckates into my Father-in-Laws hands to dispose of as he shall think
fit, for the good of my Wife; which the King no sooner heard, but he told them
it was very opportunely hit; for said he, the Earl of Litgorn is about to sell
a Lordship, with a Castle and other Appurtenances, being necessitated for ready
money, and if you think good I will send for him; to this they all agreed, and
when the Earl was come, the King acquainted him with the matter: upon which to
the great content of all parties, a bargain was driven, the Earl of Litgorn in
lieu of 7000 Ducats delivering up his Title to the said Lordship, with the
Government of the Village to Fortunatus, who delivered the Charge thereof to
his Father-in-law for the use of Cassandra, which pleased the Countess beyond
measure.

CHAP. XVIII.
How after the Departure of the King, Queen and Nobility, Fortunatus ordained a
Feast for all the chief Citizens.

DVring the Kings stay, Fortunatus set up three Jewels of great price, the
first the Nobility Tilted for, he that did best being to possess the same; the
second was provided for the Esquires and Gentlemen; the third for the Citizens,
Yeomen and Servants, which caused them to Just for nine days; which Pastime
exceedingly pleased the King and all present. Now the time came that at the end
of Fourteen days, the King and Queen with the rest of the Nobility would
depart, Fortunatus with all his Attendants accompanied them Ten Miles outward
of their way, and then the King desiring him to return, he came back to his
Bride, and calling his Servants together, gave order that within two days they
should provide another Feast for the Citizens and Gentlemen thereabouts; which
was accordingly done, it holding Four days with great plenty of Mirth.

The Feast ended, Fortunatus taking Leopoldus aside, said; Forasmuch as thou
have faithfully served me hitherto, I will now propose to thee three Things,
take thy choice of either: First, if thou art minded to return into Ireland, I
will give thee four Servants to attend thee, and as much Money as shall
maintain thee during life. Secondly, If thou will live in the House with me
(for I am not now mindful of Travel) I will maintain thee to thy hearts
content. Thirdly, If it shall otherways like thee, I will give thee a Horse in
this City, and maintain Servants to wait upon thee, and thou shall lack nothing
during life: For these kind Offers Leopoldus greatly thanked him, saying, he
was unworthy of them; As for the first, I being now spent with Age and Travel,
by reason of the tediousness of the way, shall hardly get thither; and for the
second, seeing you have a fair Lady to accompany you, and many Servants, my
being in the House will be needless; therefore if it shall so please you, I
will embrace the latter: with which Fortunatus was content, and bought him a
Horse provided him Servants, and all Necessaries, allowing him 20 Ducats a
week: Then Leopoldus prayed that he might be still of his Council in all
weighty Affairs, and that he would not suffer his love toward him to decay,
which he solemnly swore to observe. In awhile after, Leopoldus sent into
Ireland for his Wife and Children, acquainting them by Letters of the
prosperous Condition he was in, and wished them to sell off what they had and
come to him; but before their arrival, he, by reason of a grievous sickness,
died, to the great grief of Fortunatus and his Lady, who caused him to be
buried in a fair Tomb in the Chancel of the Church which he had built,: and
upon the arrival of Leopoldus his Wife and Children, he entertained them
courteously, comforting them in the best manner, and placing them in the house
he had given to Leopoldus, and there maintaining them so long as they lived.

CHAP. XIX.
How fair Cassandra was brought to Bed of two fair Sons, whom Fortunatus caused
to be Baptized, naming the elder Ampedo, and the younger Andolocia.

NOw Fortunatus being in the height of Joy, dasly solacing with his fair Bride
the beautiful Cassandra, he wanted nothing but Children, the dearest Pledges of
mutual Love, for which he often prayed, and cau ed the Priests to pray; till at
last God heard him, and the tender Bride grew big with her first Son, which
afterward was Christ'ned with great Solemnity, and called Ampedo; scare had
they made an end of rejoicing for this Son before the teeming Lady perceived
her self quick with another Child, which proved a Son also, and was named
Andolocia; this brought a double Joy, and the rather, because Fortunatus
remembered the words of Dame Fortune, which were, That if he had no Issue, the
Virtue of his Purse should fail with his Life: but Cassandra knew not of this
nor of the Purse; Fortunatus not thinking it convenient to trust a Woman with
so weighty a Secret. After they came to years of Maturity, he caused them to be
brought up in Learning, providing for them the ablest Tutors he could get; as
likewise to Fence, Just, play upon Music, and all other Arts and Sciences that
belonged to a complete. Gentleman, for these were all the Children he was
likely to have by the fair Cassandra.

CHAP. XX.
How Fortunatus prevailed with his Wife to Travel again, and what befell him
during his being abroad.

WHen Fortunatus had lived with his Wife about sixteen years, he began to think
of his former Travels, considering that for the most part they had been in
Europe; whereupon he had been deprived of seeing such strange Rarities as other
Countries in Asia did produce, he thereupon resolved to travel once again, but
durst not for a long time disclose his Mind to his Wife, for fear of driving
her into a Fit of Melancholy; but at last as he was walking with her in the
Garden, he began to discourse her about his former Travels, and at last told
her, that seeing it was not likely that he should have any more Children, he
was purposed to see the Indies, Egypt, and Palestina, for that he had already
traveled over one half of the World. This drew Tears from the fair Cassandra,
who with tender weeping and many Entreaties besought him out of love to her and
her Children, and by all the mutual Ties of their Conjugal Love, not to leave
her: for in his absence her life would be altogether comfortless: Then he
comforted her, telling her, he would make but a short stay of it, reckoning to
return within a year; but this nothing pacified the disconsolate Lady, who
demanded of him in what she had offended, that he who was the Joy of her Life,
would leave her? and that if she had transgressed in ought, she would double
her Obedience for the future: To which he answered, that she never offended
him, but that he loved her as dear as his life, yet he was resolved to go, and
nothing but Sickness or Death should hinder him; then she desired him if he
would needs go, that he should travel into a Christian Country, and not expose
his life to the Cruelty of Heathens, who most of all envy Christians and seek
their blood; to which he replied, That he had seen all the Christian Countries
already, and that now he resolved to see both the Indies, and the places he had
before named: But when she perceived she could not prevail with him neither by
Tears nor Entreaty, she fell down in a Swound, which moved Fortunatus to
Compassion; when coming to her self, she sighed bitterly, saying, O what have I
done that I must lose the Joy of my Life so soon? Then she sent to her Father
and Mother to come and entreat him to stay, but they prevailed not: So that
when she saw there was no way to prevail, and that he had made a Vow to depart,
she began a little to be contented, and upon his promise of a quick return,
unwillingly yielded; when as Fortunatus leaving her 10000. Crowns, he promises
himself a Ship, and with his Purse went on Board only accompanied with two
Servants.

CHAP. XXI.
How Fortunatus set Sail from Cyprus, and traveled into many strange
Countries, and of the Adventures he met withal.

FOrtunatus having hired many skilful Mariners, he commanded to loose their
Anchor and Sail for Alexandria, a City in Egypt, where in short time having a
prosperous Wind they arrived; when coming into the Port, the Soldan's Officers
demanded who was Master of the Ship? To which the Mariners answered, one
Fortunatus a Nobleman of the Isse of Cyprus; then they said, he must appear
before the Sultan, and make his Present, which was the Custom of them that came
into that Port: Fortunatus hearing this, took with him several rich Jewels, and
so went to the Soldan's Court; being conducted thither by the Guards that
usually wait upon the Seacoast on the like occasion, where when he was
arrived, he ord'red them to set a fair Table; which being done accordingly, he
set many fair Jewels thereon, but had scarce time to place them before the
Sultan came attended with his Nobles, and a great Guard, and perceiving the
Jewels, he supposed they were set for Sale; and thereupon began to inquire
their Price; upon which Fortunatus demanded whether he liked them? to which the
Sultan replied, Very well; forasmuch as they were the fairest that he had seen:
then said Fortunatus, they are at your Highness's Service, take them and
dispose of them as you please: When the Sultan heard him say so, he marvelled
greatly that one Merchant should make a Present richer than any Twenty had
formerly done, the Jewels not being esteemed less worth than 5000 Crowns; yet
he accepted them, and promised Fortunatus that they should not be given in
vain: and was as good as his word, for he sent him the next day three Carts
laden with Pepper; this did not a little grieve the Merchants, who said amongst
themselves, we have made many Presents to the Sultan, but never received any
return, but we perceive this upstart Merchant is greatly favored.

Within awhile after the Sultan sent to Invite Fortunatus to Dinner, providing
a very costly Entertainment, and in a while after the Lord High Admiral invited
him likewise, which greatly offended the Merchants, forasmuch as they had given
him great Sums of Money to turn Fortunatus out of Favor with the Sultan; but
Fortunatus being thereof advertised, out-gave them, so that he ever had the
Admiral on his side: so that he had the first choice of the richest Merchandise
which he ever bought. But now the time being come for the Ships departure, he
gave the Master of her order to go to Spain, Holland, England, and other
places, and unlade the Merchandise, which for the most part consisted of
Spices; and at the end, of one year, to return to Alexandria again, where he
intended to be: but in the mean while he would travel into many Countries, and
if they found him not there, then they should conclude him dead, and carry back
the Ship and Goods to Cyprus, and there deliver them up to the use of his Wife
and Children: this they promised to do, and thereupon they departed the Master
to steer his Course, and Fortunatus to Travel.

CHAP. XXII.
How Fortunatus took his leave of the Sultan, and departed for India, and how
he sped there.

FOrtunatus having procured Letters from the Sultan to many Kings and Princes,
through whose Countries he intended to travel, he departed with them joyfully,
and taking Ship, he sailed into Persia, where after he had beheld the Splendour
of the Emperors Court, he departed to Cathia, where the Cham of Tartaria bears
Rule there; he likewise stayed not long, by reason of the Barbarity of the
People, who use Strangers very rudely; from thence he went through many Deserts
full of wild Beasts, which put him often in peril of his life, especially a Tiger
which lay in ambush behind a Tree, waiting for some Traveller; who as soon as
she espied Fortunatus coming, she set up such a Yelp as made the Forest
tremble; and thereupon came at him with an open Mouth, stretching out her
dreadful Paws to grasp him to her, which Fortunatus perceiving, he drew his
Sword and stood upon his Guard, as also did his Men: and as the Tiger made at
him, Fortunatus with a full blow smote off one of her forelegs, which yet
enraged her the more, so that she came at him again, when he watching his
opportunity, thrust his Sword down her Throat; and so reaching her Heart she
fell down dead; then he exceedingly rejoiced, and traveled on; where by the
way he found the Remains of dead men's Carcasses which had been torn to pieces
by the wild Beasts, and caused his Servants to cover them with earth; this
Forest was exceeding long, and therefore although they traveled Day and Night,
it was two Days and two Nights ere they could pass it; then riding through many
Cities, they came into India, or the Country of Pester John, who is Almighty
Monarch, and has under him 62 Kings, being Lord of 30 Islands, besides what he
possesses on the Continent or main Land. Here Fortunatus met with an old Hermit
who was traveling to the Holy Land, and gave him 10 Crowns to bear his
Charges; this Hermit conducted him and his men the nearest way to the Court of
the Emperor, and gave them an account of the Customs of the Country, saying,
That he had passed it many times, and that in his youth he had been a great
Traveller: then Fortunatus requested him to accompany him in his Travels, but
he refused, saying, He was under a Vow to depart straightways to the Holy Land,
and so giving Fortunatus many thanks for his courteous Benevolence, he departed
on his way, and Fortunatus rode to the Emperors Palace.

CHAP. XXIII.
How Fortunatus arrived at Prester John's Court, and was speedily entertained,
and how he met there with two Conjurers, and how they sent two Witches to steal
away his Purse, with many other strange Adventures.

WHen Fortunatus from the top of an Hill beheld the Palace which glittered with
Gold, so that by reason of the reflection of the Sunbeams it shone like a
Comet, he greatly admired it, saying, That since it was so fair without, it
must needs be very beautiful within, and so by Noon he approached it; at which
tune the Emperor and his Lords were returned from hunting of wild Beasts,
whereupon he had the opportunity of seeing them clad in warlike Habiliments,
which was after so strange a manner, that he greatly wond'red; when they were
all entered, he came to the Porter, and demanded if he and his Companions might
not be admitted to behold the Palace, and take a view of the Emperor's
Magnificent Entertainment, that so they might report it to his Praise, when
they returned into their own Country: The Porter perceiving that they were
Gentlemen and Strangers, freely admitted them; upon which Fortunatus gave him a
Ruby worth 30 Crowns: then coming into the Emperor's Presence, he signified to
him, thet he had some Presents for him, and thereupon drew forth his Jewels,
which were very rich, for he always bought the fairest; which the Emperor
accepting of, gave him many thanks, and ord'red his chief Officer to feast them
nobly, and to show them all the Riches of his Palace, which were such as
Fortunatus had never seen before; for the Walls some were plated with Silver,
wherein were engraven Stories of Knights and Battles, with the valiant
Achievements of the former Emperors; others were hung with Panthars Skins,
which cast a fragrant smell; the Pillars that supported the Hall they were of
Cedar over-laid with Gold, and imbossed with precious Stones: This pleased
Fortunatus so well, that he gave the Officer a Jewel worth 100 Ducats. Now
when Dinnertime was come, Fortunatus and his Men were set down with the chief
Officers and Noblemen; for such is the Custom of the Country, that none but
the Princes of the Blood may Dine with the Emperor: Now in the midst of their
Mirth, Fortunatus perceived the Bottles and Flagons begin to dance upon the
Table, at which he began greatly to wonder; when one that sat by him whispered
him in the Ear, and told him it was done by Magic, and that the Emperor kept
two Necromancers to make Pastime for Strangers; now after the Bottles had done
dancing, there sprung up a Tree full of fair Oranges, which several Blacks came
and plucked off, and then the Tree vanished; after that a large Stag came
running in, and after him a Pack of Hounds at full Cry, who taking a Course or
two round the Hall vanished; then several fair Women in strange Attire came in
playing upon Lutes, and after having danced a turn or two, vanished: At this
Fortunatus was greatly amazed, but well considering with himself it was only a
Delusion of the Devil, and no real Substance, he rested the better content: Now
when Dinner was ended, the Emperor sent for Fortunatus to ride a Hunting with
him, which he gladly did, and coming into a Forest about six Miles from the
Palace, there they rouzed a Lion who was sleeping in the Thicket, who shaked
his brindled Mane, and reared so loud, that all the Forest trembled; upon which
the Dogs were uncoupled, of which he roar several in pieces, and fought against
several of them for the space of an Hour; when the Indians came running with
their Lances, and run him into the body, so that he fell down dead, then took
they off his Skin as a Trophy of Victory: After that the Dogs found out a great
wild Boar, upon which they fastened, notwithstanding he gored many of them with
his horrid Tusks, which were at least a foot long, and then the Iavelings being
darted thick at him, he at last was killed, and his Head being cut off, was
carried before the Emperor upon a Spear, as likewise the Lyon's Skin.

By this time Sun was set, which made the Emperor hasten to his Palace, where,
at Supper-time, Fortunatus drew a great deal of Gold out of his Purse, and gave
amongst such as attended at the Table, which the Necromancers perceiving, who
were also sitting at the Table, they thought with themselves this Stranger must
needs be exceeding Rich, that can thus liberally dispense with his Money,
therefore it will not be amiss when he is in Bed, if we use our Art, to get
some of him; so that when all was done, and every one gone to their Chambers,
they began to mutter over their Charms, and by that means raised their
Familiars, commandig them to tell them who the Stranger was, and how he came by
such quantities of Gold and Jewels; to which they replied, He was a Merchant of
Cyprus, and that he had a secret Mine which they were forbidden to reveal,
which could not be emptied during his Life, and thereupon they vanished: Now
the Conjurers sent for their Wives, who had familiar Spirits likewise, to
attend them, and could transform themselves, to appearance, into any shape:
they being come, the Conjurers commanded them, in the shapes of Monkeys, to
enter Fortunatus his Lodgings, and bring thence what Treasure they could find;
the which they readily obeyed: when opening the Casements, they entered; but by
clapping them to and again, Fortunatus awoke, and supposing that they had been
Thieves, drew his Sword, and striking at a venture, cut one of their Fore-feet
off, whereupon they got out at the Window again, making such a lamentable Noise
as wakened a great many of those that lodged near, next morning Fortunatus
getting up, espied a hand lying on the ground, at which he was sore dismayed:
but as he went to take it up, it was snatched from him he knew not how, so that
he never saw it after: yet so it happened, that the next day one of the
Conjurers Wives had lost her hand, which accosioned her Husband to fall out
with his fellow, for putting her upon that exploit; insomuch that falling to
Words, they both vowed revenge one of the other, when as he that had his Wife
hurt, taking his opportunity when the other was leaning out at a window, he
fixed a great pair of Stags Horns upon his head, so that he could by no means
draw it in, but was obliged to stay there till the Charm was dissolved, which
caused great laughter to such as beheld it, but in him it caused a desperate
resolve of revenge: so that one day he having drawn the Figure of a Man upon
the Wall with small cole, he compelled his adversary, notwithstanding all the
intreagues he used to stand up against it, when immediately the Wall opened,
and he sinking into it, was never heard of afterward.

These Projects, and Hellish arts so affrighted Fortunatus, that he having got
together abundance of Merchandise, and the Emperor's Letter of free Traffic in
such Countries as he came into, under the Emperor's Jurisdiction; he took his
leave and departed, traveling toward Jerusalem, where he no sooner arrived,
but he found an old Hermet, who showed him the Holy Sepulcher, the pieces of
the Cross, the Apostle, St. James's Tomb, and many other Relics, which
Pilgrims go thither to see; when he had viewed as much as he thought fit, he
began to remember the promise he had made to his wife, and thereupon taking
leave of the Old Man, he journyed to Alexandria.

CHAP. XXIV.
How Fortunatus was well-comed by the Souldan, as he returned to Alexandria,
and what befell him, during his stay.

FOrtunatus being now within eight miles of Alexandria, he sent one of his
servants to acquaint the Admiral of his approach, and to desire the Souldan's
Letters to enter the City with his Camels, of which he had about 20 laden with
the riches of India, having hired Natives of the Country to drive them, and to
have the stronger guard, for fear of robbers: when the servant had done his
hellish message, the Admiral ordered his Horses to be made ready, and rode to
meet Fortunatus, who lovingly embraced him, and asked him how he had faired,
during his traveling in strange Countries; whereupon Fortunatus told him all
that had happened from time to time: then he conducted him to the Souldan, who
was glad of his return, and caused a Feast to be made for him; when within
three days after his coming thither, his Ship arrived from Famogosta, with
Letters from Cassandra, who earnestly desired his return; so that having put
his Merchandise on board, he would have set Sail: but going to take his leave
of the Souldian, and to make him a present, he would needs have him stay and
dine with him, which he could not deny him; yet he sent one of his servants to
the master of the Ship, to require him to be in a readiness to set Sail; for
that he intended as soon as he had dined, to come on board: the master was
obedient. and put off the Vessel, ready to Sail, all her Anchors being weighed;
yet the time of Fortunatus his coming was prolonged, by reason that the Souldan
held him in discourse about his late travels: the which Fortunatus was obliged
to relate, thanking the Souldan for his Letters, by which means he told him he
had found kind Reception in many places, especially from the neighboring
Princes, who speak very well of him. Then would Fortunatus have taken his
leave, but the Souldan prevailed with him to stay supper also.

CHAP. XXV.
How Fortunatus going with the Souldan into his Treasury to see his Jewels,
understood the secret virtue of his wishing Hat, and how wishing himself on
Shipboard, was he brought thither through the Air, and set Sail for Cyprus,
with the wishing Hat.

FOrtunatus being impatient of delay, least he should break his promise with
his Wife; after supper was ended, he drew out a great deal of Gold, and
bestowed it freely upon the servants, and again demanded leave to depart: but
the Souldan seeing his infinite riches, thought that unless he showed him his,
he might boast in his own Country that he had the greater wealth: whereupon he
desired him to follow him; and so led him into his Treasury which was all hung
with Cloth of Tinse, and the Tables spread with Jewels, Rings, and Vessels of
Gold and Silver, Gold Chains, and huge Pearls, with many other things of great
price, which Fortunatus had never seen the like before: then he had him into
another Room, where he showed him on infinite mass of money; and now, says he, I
have one thing more that I esteem above all that you have yet beheld, this made
Fortunatus wonder: for, thought he, it must be of an inesteemable price if it
exceed what I have seen already, and thereupon he grew impatient to have a view
of it: when as the Souldian taking him by the hand, led him into another
Chamber; and there taking down an old hat, said, this is the Jewel; at which
Fortunatus smiled, telling him that was an old hat, and might be bought for a
small matter: yes, said the Souldian, if it was only a hat, it was of no value,
but there is such a secret retained in it, that for all the hats in the World,
I would not leave it; nay, should I loose all my Jewels, I could purchase more,
but should I loose this hat, such another the World affords not: then was
Fortunatus very desireous to know the secret it retained; then said the
Souldan; since you are my friend, I will impart it to you; which is this, that
having this hat on, where ever you wish your self to be, thither shall you be
conveyed almost as swift as can be thought: so that when my Nobles are gone a
Hunting, it is but wishing my self with them, and I am there: when my armies
are abroad, I can be with them, and in my Palace almost in a moment; as
likewise upon any occasion, it is but putting this hat on, and I can be carried
into any Country with a wish, and so back again.

At this strange report, Fortunatus stood amazed, but yet secretly pondered
with himself, that if it were true the Souldian said, he would by any means
possess it, if he might; for thought he, my Purse and that Hat, are enough for
the richest Emperor in the World: and thereupon he asked the Soldian, by reason
of the qualities it retained, whether it were not heavyer than any other hat?
no, said the Souldan, but rather lighter than any other: therefore for your
satisfaction, try it on your head. This was what Fortunatus wished for, which
made him that he could scarce forbear smiling; saying, he thought it had been
much heavyer, and withal, that he did not think that the Sultan, knowing the
virtue on it, would be so unadvised as to trust him with it; and thereupon
stepping to the Window, he wished himself on board his Ship; and thereupon
before the Sultan could prevent him, he flew out at the Window, and was in his
Ship in a moment, woodcut of Fortunatus sitting in the window with the sultan
standing, arms in the air repetitive woodcut of multiple trees then Commanding
the Mariners to clap up all their Sails, they steered their course before the
wind with such speed, that although the Sultan Commanded his Gally that lay in
the Port to make after them, they could not come near the Ship of Fortunatus,
upon which the Soldian was yet the more enraged, swearing by his Gods, that if
he could take him, he would put him to the cruelest Death that ever man dyed;
but the Merchants that usualy traded there, greatly rejoiced when they heard
what was done, though they durst not show it openly: for, said they, now this
Interloper will come no more amongst us, to spoil our Traffic.

The Sultan being greatly perplexed in his mind for the loss of his Hat, was
resolved to asend after Fortunatus into Cyprus; there to make him large offers,
if he would either send or bring it; whereupon he sent for Marcholandus a
Venetian, that served under him, and acquainted him with what had passed, and
willed him to take one of his best Ships, and follow Fortunatus into Cyprus;
and first persuade him by entreaty and promises to restore the Hat, and if that
would not do, to complain of his Treachery to the King of the Island, and if he
refused to do Justice, to denounce a War against him; this the Venetian gladly
undertook, as well knowing, if he could recover the Hat, the Sultan would
greatly favor and reward him; and so having all things in a readiness, he set
Sail.

CHAP. XXVI.
How the Soldan's Ambassador came after Fortunatus to Cyprus, for the Wishing
Hat, and how he complained to the King; but was sent away without it.

FOrtunatus after two months departure from Alexandria, arrived at Cyprus,
where he was joyfully met by a great number of Nobility, and conducted to the
Kings presence; who welcomed him home, and asked him of his travels, the which
he at large related, and then taking his leave, put on his Wishing Hat, and
going without the City, wished himself at his own House, and was there in a
trice: when coming in, he met Cassandra, who run to him, and clasping him in
her arms, could not speak to him a good while for joy; then he having saluted
his Sons and Servants, he commanded meat to be set before him; and the next day
invited a great number of his neighbors to dine with him, whom he feasted
after the best manner.

Now when he had been at home about eight days, on the 10th of his arrival in
the Island, Marcholandus, who was sent by the Sultan, came to his House, and
desired to speak with him; who coming to him, he desired that they might be in
private: whereupon Fortunatus took him by the hand, and led him into the Dining
Room, and then willed him to declared his business; whereupon he delivered him
the Soldans Letter, and therewithal informed him how ungreatful he had been, in
taking away the Hat, yet the Sultan would forget it all, and highly reward him,
if he would restore it; I must confess, said Fortunatus, the Sultan has cause
to be offended, but let him thank his own folly in putting it upon my Head, I
knew not the virtue of it before he declared it; and therefore since I ran the
hazard of drowning, by flying on Shipboard with it, I am in the mind never to
part with it. Then Marcholandus told him what offers the Sultan had made him,
if he would restore it: and therefore out of all love desired him to let him
carry it with him, or that he would carry it himself; but Fortunatus told him
he would not part with it for the Soldan's Kingdom, and therefore willed him to
cease his suit.

Upon this, Marcholandus growing impatient, began to threaten him; saying, that
he would complain to the King, and if no redress could be had there, the Sultan
would right him by Arms: at which Fortunatus smiling, bid him do as he pleased,
and thereupon Marcholandus departed to the Court, where procuring to be
admitted to the King's presence, he grievously complained of Fortunatts;
telling all that had happened concerning the Hat, and desired his Majesty to
use his Prerogative Royal, in compelling him to restore it; but the King said
that Fortunatus was his dear friend, and he would not in any wise use
compulsion toward him; but if he would deliver it up of his own accord well
and good, but if not, the Law was open, and he must take his Regular Course.
But Marcholandus well knew that Fortunatus was too powerful in his own
Country, for a stranger to wage Law against him: whereupon he told the King,
that upon the refusal of delivering the Hat, he had a Commission to denounce
War, even as you please for that, said the King; and tell the Sultan, that
although I esteem his friendship, yet I fear not his anger, but shall defend my
self as well as I can; upon this, Morcholandus returned very heavy, and told
the Soldian all that had passed, who thereupon conceived such an inward grief
for the loss of his Hat, that in a short time he dyed.

CHAP. XXVII.
How Fortunatus finding himself in a declining condition, prepared himself for
another World.

FOrtunatus being now about 60 years of Age, began to bethink himself that his
thread of Life was almost at an end, and thereupon he resolved to prepare
himself for a future state, greatly lamenting the loss of so much precious time
as he had spent in frivilous and vain trifles, wishing that he had chosen
wisdom rather than riches; for, said he, they are ever cumbersome, troublesome,
and full of danger: how often have they destroyed both Soul and Body, and what
wickedness is there in the World that will not be done for money? What horrid
Bloodshed, Massacres, and Civil Wars, does it stir up? Well! I must confess,
for the greatest part of my Life, I have had exceeding plenty, but have not
lived so free and truly merry, as when I had nothing but what I worked for: how
often has my life been endangered by reason of my Purse? nay, past doubt I had
been murdered long since, for if it; any had known its virtue; but now I will
earnestly repent me of my former folly; and upon that he let fall many tears:
at which instant, Cassandra coming in, demanded the cause of his heaviness, to
whom he imparted it without any dissimulation; and she on the other hand strove
to comfort him: but at last his Melancholy drew him into a Consumption, which
soon occasioned his Death, as shall in the next Chapter be shown.

CHAP. XXVIII.
How Fortunatus falling sick, made his Will; and declared to his Sons the
virtue of his Purse and the Hat, with a Command not to disclose them to any, as
likewise of his Death.

FOrtunatus being sick unto death, and perceiving his end to be nigh, called
his Sons to him and blessed them, biding them to live lovingly and peaceably
together: and that he would leave them a sufficient Competency to maintain them
both in a most splendid condition; but, said he, it is such a secret, as will
loose its virtue if once discovered, therefore take my Counsel in all points,
and so you will prosper, or otherwise be in perpetual danger, for seldom is it
seen, that disobedient Children prosper: when he had said thus much, he called
for his Purse and Hat and advertised them of the secrets they contained,
saying, that no Mortal ever yet knew the virtue of the Purse, but himself
excepted: but as for the Hat, said he, I got it from the Sultan of Babylon, who
offered me many rich presents for to have it again, he repetitive woodcut of
single tree woodcut of Fortunatus in bed with two men standing next to the bed
esteeming it more worth, than all his inestimable Treasure, therefore as you
tender the enjoying of them, do not in any wise disclose the secret virtue of
either of them, lest in so doing, you either loose them or your lives; and
farther, he advised them not to part the Jewels, but to live together lovingly,
and when he had so said, he cried with a loud voice! Lord receive my Spirit,
and so yielded up the Ghost: after which, his Sons and his Wife made great
Lamentation for him; and caused him to be buried in the Chancel, near his
Father and Mother in a new Tomb, which he had caused to be built in his
lifetime.

About a month after, Cassandra, for the exceeding sorrow she conceived at his
Death, fell into a violent Feavour, and dyed likewise: and was, by her Sons,
buried in the same Sepulcher with her Husband. Now after the days of Mourning
were over, Andolocia, Fortunatus his youngest Son, being inflamed with a desire
to Travel; upon reading what adventures his Father had met with in strange
Countries, he thus bespeak to his Brother. Dear, Brother, since we are both in
our Youth and Strength, it is not fit that we should spend our time in idleness,
therefore let us travel, and see strange Countries; but this nothing liked
Ampedo, the Eldest, who was given rather to the rest of a quiet Life; whereupon
he answered. Dear Brother, if you are minded to travel you may, but as for me,
I will stay in this Palace, and spend my days in my Native Country. Then said
Andolocia, let us part the Jewels, give me my Portion and let me be gone: not
so said Ampedo, know you not that it was our fathers strict Command when he
dyed, that we should not part them; no matter for that, said Andolocia, now he
is Dead, he will never repine at what we do; then said Ampedo, take you your
Hat and be packing; no, said Andolocia, I will have the Purse, if any: upon
this, there arose a hot dispute between them, till Andolocia said, then if you
needs will have Money, fill two Coffers out of the Purse, and take the Hat and
the rest of the Jewels, with free possession of all the Houses and Palaces,
and give me the Purse only; and at six Years end, I will return and deliver it
you again; to this Ampedo consented, lest in the heat of Quarrel, the secrets
of the Purse should be revealed, and so the difference between them was ended,

CHAP. XXIX How Andolocia went with his Purse into the French Court, and what
entertainment he foun.
there.

ANdolocia, having got the Purse, departed joyfully, and after having passed
through many Countries, at last he came into France, when repairing to Paris the
chief City, he went to view the splendour of the Kings Court: where attiring
himself after the best manner, he accompanied himself with the Nobility and
Gentry, spending even to admiration; for such was his liberality, that he
exceeded most of the Nobility; and kept such stately entertainment, and such
costly Garbs, as the Country did afford: but long he had not stayed there,
before Iusts were ordained, and a Challenge made by certain Noble Personages
against any that durst Encounter them: upon which Andolocia prepared for the
Combat, and unhorsed three Earls, one after another: of which the King took
great notice, and ordered that he should be entertained in his Palace; when
night came, the Ladys and Gentlemen were disposed to Dance; amongst which, the
King would have Andolocia make one, where he so well behaved himself, that all
the Eyes of the Ladys were upon him; and from that time forth they highly
esteemed him, and he, by often conversing with them, at last fell deep in Love
with one of them, who was a beautiful Lady, and Wife to a Courtier of
Andolocia's acquaintance: and so passionate he was, that finding a fit
opportunity he told her his desire, saying, that if she would consent to lie
with him but one night, he would give her a 1000 Crowns; but she being a
Virtuous Lady refused his proffer, and acquainted her Husband what offer
Andolocia had made: who considered what a great help a 1000 Crowns would be to
him in his necessity, yet was very loath to be a Cuckold; so that casting
about, they at last agreed to get a Neighbor of theirs to suply her Room, and
so to deceive him in his Expectation; this liked them both very well,
whereupon, when Andolocia importuned her again, she gave him hopes, telling him
that such an Evening her Husband would be abroad about earnest business, and
then if he would come and bring with him the Money he should be entertained to
his wish. This rejoiced not Andolocia a little, who thought every hour a day
till the happy Lover was come: now in the mean time, she went to her Neighbor
and told her, she should have a 100 Crowns if she would but prostitute her Body
to a Gentleman in her stead, so that it might not be discerned; for, said she,
I would willingly do it, but that my Husband so narrowly watches me that I have
no opportunity; to this the Neighbor freely consented, without any Scruple of
Conscience, as being used to the Trade, and so at the time appointed Andolocia
came and brought the Money, which the Lady took, then biding him sit down, she
conveyed her Neighbor in at a back Door, and put her into her own Bed, and
when it was dark, Andolocia, was by the Chambermaid whom he bribed with 20
Crowns, led to the Bed, and there pulling off his Clothes in he went, and
embraced the Gentlewoman with abundance of kindness, sporting it by times till
it was almost day; when as his Bedfellow would have risen, but he would not
suffer her: so that she knowing when light appeared, she should be discovered,
for fear freely confessed the whole matter: which greatly grieved him that he
had been so deceived, for instead of a beautiful Gentlewoman whom he thought he
had in Bed with him, he had embraced a common Strumpet; yet dissembling the
matter as well as he could, gave the Baggage a 100 Crowns, telling her what he
had given the Gentlewoman before; and ordered her as soon as he was departed
the City, to sue for them, seeing the Gentlewoman had not performed her
promise; which she being armed with impudence did accordingly, and put the Lady
to great shame and disgrace

CHAP. XXX.
How Andolocia went to the King of Spain's Court, and of the noble
entertainment he received there, and what Achievements he made.

ANdolocia having had this Female cheat put upon him, resolved to stay no
longer in the French Court, lest it should be noised abroad to his disgrace:
but immediately taking Horse, he rode with his Servants to Navar, from thence
to Aragon, and so to the Spanish Court, which in those days greatly flourished,
where, for the better entertainment, he put himself into a Spanish Garb, for
such is the humor of that Nation; that they will, by their good wills, sort
themselves with none but such as comply with their fashion. At that time there
were Wars with Portugal, so that Andolocia raising a 100 men paid them
himself, and rid at the head of them in the King's Service; where by his Valor
and undaunted Courage, he got himself great Praise, insomuch that the King
taking notice of it, not only Knighted him, but likewise bestowed many rich
presents on him, and proferred to Marry him to the Daughter of an ancient Earl;
with whom after the Father's Decease, he should have the Earldom: but Andolocia
humbly thanked his Majesty, saying, that he was not disposed to Marry, for that
he was resolved to see many Countries.

Within a while after the Wars ceasing, Andolocia dismissed his Soldiers, and
took leave of the King, who was very loath to part with him; yet, Andolocia
urging him, he bid him farewell, and when ever he came into Spain again, to
make use of his Court, as freely as if it were his own: after he had left the
King, he took Shiping and sailed for England, when coming up the River of
Thames, he landed at the Tower of London, and much admired the strong and
stately Building; when coming to the Court, and having taken a view of the
same, he searched for a stately House as near to it as possible: which he
having found, furnished it after the best manner, and retained many Men and
Maidservants, keeping a very plentiful Table, insomuch that a great many of
the Courtiers resorted daily thither, and were by him feasted; of which the
King hearing, he sent for him, and asked him what he was, who accordingly told
him; then said the King, will you be content to have a Command under me in the
Wars against the Scots? Yes, with a very good will said Andolocia, and will
raise and maintain a hundred men at my proper cost and charges: at this the
King was greatly pleased, and made him a Captain, so that going against the
Enemy, he fought so manfully that he broke their Ranks, and greatly disordered
them, insomuch that fresh forces coming on, they soon put them to the rout, and
although many did bravely that day, yet Andolocia did best, which yet the more
indear'd the King to him.

CHAP. XXXI.
How Andolocia being at Dinner with the King, fell in Love with a Agrypina the
Princess, and what happened after.

ANdolocia was no sooner returned from the Wars, but the King sent his Stewerd
to invite him to Dinner, as likewise several of the chief Commanders were
likewise present, many Ladys and Gentlewomen, and amongst the rest, the
Princess of Agrypina, who, for beauty, surpassed all her Sex: on her Andolocia
fixing his Eyes, so surfrited on her beauty, that he could never eat nor drink
to any purpose, but still kept his Eyes fixed on her: and wished that he was a
Prince for her sake, though, said he, I am as well able to keep her, as ever a
Prince in Christendom; yet, I not being of Royal Blood, it will be but in vain
for me to flatter my self into a belief, that she will condescend to my
request, should I ask her yet; it is but trying: and from the time forth,
Andolocia attired himself in Purple and Gold, and would ever be the foremost in
Tilts and Iusts that were to be before the King, Queen, and Princes, where he
won great Applause; after which taking his opportunity, he invited the Queen
and her Daughter to Dinner, and so splendidly entertained them, that they had
not beheld the like in the King's Palace; and at their departure, gave each of
them a Rich Jewel, which they very readily accepted. At Andolocia's next coming
to Court the King met him, and told him that he heard how he had entertained
the Queen and Princess to their content, saying, if he had but known of his
Feast, he would have been there in Person; whereupon Andolocia excused himself,
saying, he durst not presume so high, as to invite His Majesty; but that if he
would so far Honor him with his Presence, he would be infinitely obliged to
him for so great an Honor: to this the King consented, and appointed the next
day to come, whereupon Andolocia provided a more costly entertainment than
before: insomuch that the King marveled how he could live at that rate: several
Fires he made of Ceder and Spices, which cast a fragrant smell, so that the
King and several of his Nobles sat down, and were exceeding merry; continuing
there till Evening, and then departed: at whose departure, Andolocia gave money
amongst the Guards, and humbly thanked the King for the Honor he had done him.

When the King came to the Court, he told the Queen and Princess how bravely he
had been entertained; and that he did not a little wonder how Andolocia, having
neither Lands nor Subjects, to appearance, could spend so liberally; therefore
he said, he believed he must be some Priest in disguise: truly, said the Queen,
I can but wonder as well as you! and have had a longing mind to know how he
comes by so much money, and of late I have bethought my self of the means: he
has, for some time past, he professed great Love to our Daughter, the which by
many Simptomes I well perceive is unfeigned; wherefore I intend to Advertise
her of my Purpose, and if she show him but a little kindness, I know he will
not deny her any thing; this well pleased the King, and thereupon he ordered
Aggrypina to search out the matter, who promised to use her utmost diligence
therein.

CHAP. XXXII.
How the Princess came to know the secret of the Purse, and how she deceived
Andolocia of the same.

THe next Morning Andolocia coming to the Court, was admitted into Agrypina's
Chamber, a favor that he never before enjoyed; at which he exceedingly
rejoiced, thinking with himself that this was a happy opportunity, and
prosperous; he had not long been there before the Princess came, and with a
merry Countenance, wished him a good Morning; at which he humbly thanked her
Grace, and then she caused him to sit down by her, and fell to discourse about
diverse Affairs: as of his Travels, Birth, and Parentage, so that in such like
discourses, they spent much time; then began Andolocia to express the passion
he had for her, and that how for her sake, he would adventure any hazard. Alas!
said she, I am not at my own dispose, for if I were, your Estate would soon
decrease at the rate you live, and then I should come to poverty; fear not that
my Love, and dearest part of Life, my Estate can never grow less then it is,
although I should spend a Million a week: then belike said Aggrypina, your
Father is some Puissant Prince: not so, said Andolocia, my Father is Dead, nor
was he, neither am I, a Prince; his Riches and mine were equal, and though we
both have spent to excess, yet had we never the less.

This made Aggrypina wonder, and therefore she was the more desirous to know
whence this infinite Treasure should flow, and began to show better Countenance
than ever, saying, you have often told me you loved me Andolocia; and in that,
said he, I have not said amiss; for I protest by all that is sacred, I admire
and adore you above all Women kind, esteeming you, as indeed you are, the
fairest of your Sex: many Ladys have I seen in Foreign Courts, but your bright
perfections as far excells them all, as the Sun does the paler Luster of the
Moon; therefore vouchsafe dear Lady to cure the Wounds you have made, and
pardon my boldness.

Then said Aggrypina, if it be true, that you love me as you say, pray tell me
from whence you have such abundance of Treasure, in which when I am better
satisfied, you may expect my favor, but not till then? At this, Andolocia was
almost extasied, being drunk with Love and doting upon her Beauty, he was
resolved to satisfy her desire, and thus began. Madam, could you but keep it
secret, I would lay open to you all the secrets of my Soul, and unfold what my
Dying Father charged me not to do, though at this Instant his Ghost should rise
and blast me; nay, said Aggrypina, if you loved me, you would not doubt my
keeping your secrets, but your scrupling my Fidelity, shows you love me not: by
Heaven! said Andolocia, I do, and will reveal the secret, and thereupon in an
unlucky hour, he drew out his Purse, saying, here is my Exchequer which can
never be emptied, and thereupon he pulled out 300 pieces of Gold, and gave
woodcut of a woman standing, Andolocia and the King sitting at a table
repetitive woodcut of multiple trees them to Aggrypina, and then the Purse
seeming empty, he put in his hand and pulled out as many more, and so he did
several times; saying, thus can I do for many years together, and yet can never
empty this Purse during my Life; this was left by my Father, and given to him
by Dame Fortune, in a Wilderness, as he was traveling to see strange Countries.
Aggrypina having now understood what she most desired, she began to Plot how
she might get the Purse into her possession; and therefore told Andolocia, that
if he would promise faithfully to marry her, he should lie with her beforehand,
for that the King and Queen lodged that night in a Summer House at the upper
end of the Garden, and that by bribing her chief Woman, he might be admitted
into her Chamber: this made him leap for joy, promising to gain admittance what
ever it cost him; and so taking his leave of her, with a thousand thanks for
that she had vouchsafed to pity him, he departed: then went Aggrypina to the
King and Queen, and declared all that had happened, and how she had given him
hopes of enjoying her that night, with a design to bereive him of his Purse:
the Queen commended her Wit, and ordered a Purse to be made like to that
Aggrypina had described. When they had done, they prepared a sleepy Potion;
ordering the Cupbearer to put it into the Wine that Andolocia should drink:
which being done to the Life, about eight in the Evening, Andolocia came and
inquired for the Princesses Woman, as if he had a Letter to deliver: and when
he had found her, he gave her a Purse with a 100 Crowns in it, telling his
purpose; of which she made something strange, though she knew it from the
Princess: yet she shut him into the Princesses Chamber, where he had not stayed
long, before Aggrypina came and bid him welcome, then she sent the Matron for
two Bottles of Wine, one for Andolocia, and another for her self: telling him,
in token of the Love she bear him, she would drink off a full bowl, and hoped
that he would do the like; now the Woman had notice to put the Drugs into that
he was to drink, which she did accordingly: after Andolocia had drunk it off,
he began to grow drousiy, so that within a while, Aggrypina and her Woman
talked him fast asleep, then she sending her Woman away, turned aside his Coat,
and took off the Purse, in the Room of which, she placed a Counterfeit one, and
then went to the King and Queen; who with much impatience expected her coming.

She was no sooner come but they demanded how she sped, to which she answered,
she had sped as she wished, for here says she is the Golden Purse; and with
that, putting her hand into it, she pulled out several handfuls of Gold, at
which the King and Queen greatly rejoiced: then the King demanded her to give
it into his keeping, but the Queen said, since she had ventured for it, it was
but Reason she should keep it.

Now whilst this discourse held, Andolocia awoke, and starting up as one
amazed, found that he had slept in the Chair all night, which did not a little
perplex him; when in the midst of his trouble, in came the Old Woman, of whom
he demanded where Aggrypina was? she told him that she having layn alone all
night in expectation of his waking and coming to bed to her, she was now risen,
being very much grieved that he should so disappoint her. And farther she told
him, that although they jogged him, and used many endeavors, they could not
wake him; then concluded Andolocia, it was done by the Enchantment of some that
envyed his happiness, and thereupon departed pensive to his House, as having
lost so happy an opportunity; that he was out of all hopes of regaining such
another, but little dreamt his Purse was gone.

CHAP. XXXIII.
How the King sent to Andolocia to prepare a Dinner for him, and how when he
found his Purse was lost, he left his House in great heavyness, and departed
for Cyprus.

NOw the King being desirous to try how Andolocia would behave himself after
the loss of his Purse, sent his Steward to him to acquaint him, that by reason
a stranger was come to Court, he purposed to bring him to his House, and
therefore willed him to provide accordingly, which Andolocia promised, as not
yet having essayed his Purse. After the Messenger was gone, he called his
Steward, and bid him provide for the King's entertainment, such things as he
thought most fit; to which he replied, his money was spent in the late costly
Banquets, and to furnish a new one he must have more money; with that Andolocia
put his hand into his Purse as formerly, but to his great amazement found
nothing in it; then began he to turn it and look upon it, but found it was not
the same: then he waxed exceeding sorrowful, and much repented him of his
folly, that, contrary to his Fathers Command, he had declared the secrets of
his Purse: as likewise, how he had been deceived by a Woman not long before,
which might have been a fair warning to him how he again trusted any of that
treacherous Sex; and in utter despair ever to gain it by fair means, he called
all his Servants about him, telling them that he had heard of the Death of his
Brother in Cyprus, and must instantly depart thither to take Possession of his
Land, and therefore willed them to take what wages was due: besides their
Horses and the furniture of the House he would freely bestow upon them, and
then leave them to shift for themselves, for that it would be too great a
trouble to carry Servants over the Sea.

At this sudden news they were all dismayed, telling him that they would
venture their Lives and Fortunes with him wherever he went: but he told them it
must not be, but that if ever he returned to England, he would find them out,
and entertain them as formerly; and so taking his leave of them, he rid to the
Sea, all alone, and there taking Ship departed for Cyprus.

CHAP. XXXIIII.
How Andolocia arrived at Cyprus, and declared to Ampedo, all that had happened.

ANdolocia sanding in the Isle of Cyprus, hasted to Famogosta and entering the
Palace, where he meeting his Brother, they kindly embraced, and asked of each
others Welfare; for now Ampedo thought to have his turn of the Purse: but when
he beheld his Brother pensive and sad, he much doubted the event, and there
upon began to ask him what was become of his men? nay, says he, as for them I
take no farther care, but am glad my self is returned with Life. Then Ampedo
began to ask him about the Purse, who answered in a mournful tone, that by
disobliging his Fathers Command, he had lost it; how! said Ampedo, by fraud or
force? nay, said he, by fraud; for falling in Love with a fair Lady, her beauty
so far bewitched me, that at her entreaty I told her the secret virtue of it;
insomuch that when I was asleep, she got it from my Girdle, and placed a false
one in the Room of it. This it is, said Ampedo, to be disobedient, had it not
been better for you to have stayed at home, without running any hazard, then
thus to loose the best Treasure the World can afford? now, if we come to
poverty, shall we be the laughing stock and scorn of all that have formerly
known our manner of living. Good Brother, said Andolocia, do not aggravate my
sorrow, for I grieve sufficiently, and repent me of my folly; insomuch that I
fear it will cast me into some dangerous sickness, of which I shall dye: when
Ampedo heard him say so, he began to leave off chiding, and strove to comfort
him, saying, well! since it is lost, let it go, I have yet 3000 Ducats left,
besides the Wishing Hat, for which I doubt not to get a great sum of money,
when some Puissant Prince shall know the virtue of it.

CHAP. XXXV.
How Andolocia deceived his Brother, and got his Wishing Hat, with which he
came into England, and carried away Aggrypina and the Purse, into a desert
place, and what there befell.

NOw when Andolocia had continued a while with his Brother, he one day told
him, that if he would lend him his Wishing Hat, he did not yet doubt to recover
the Purse: but Ampedo would by no means consent thereto, saying, that he was
wiser than so, and that the best way was to sit down w th the first loss; for,
said he, I doubt not but to get 10000 Ducats for the Hat when our money is
spent: so that when Andolocia perceived he would not part with it for an
English Voyage, he let him alone a good while, and then taking his opportunity
when his men were gone a Hunting, he desired him to let him have the Hat only to
get amongst them, that he might see the sport: to this Ampedo consented, but
Andolocia had no sooner put it on, but he wished himself at Venice, and was
instantly conveyed there through the Air: where he enquired for several Jews
who were wont to trade in Rich Jewels, and desired that he might see their
Jewels, the which they consented to, in hopes of a Chapman; but Andolocia had
no sooner got them in his hands, but he wished himself in England, and was
suddenly carried thither, the Jews imagining him to be no other than the Devil;
and blessed themselves that they did not take any of his money.

When he came into England, he disguised himself in an Italian habit, and
getting on a long Gown, went to the Court, and there pretending himself to be a
Merchant, he insinuated into the Company of Aggrypina's Gentlewomen, by giving
them small presents, that so they should persuade the Princess to buy his
Jewels, which were very rich; with which they soon acquainted her, and willed
him to spread them abroad as she passed by, which he accordingly did, and she
casting her Eyes upon them, asked if he would sell any of them? yes, and if it
shall please your Highness, I am come from a far Country for that purpose; then
she chose out several of the best, and asked him the Price, who told her she
should have them for 6000 Crowns, whereupon she bid him 3000 Crowns; but he
immagining that she would bring out the Purse, bargained with her for 4000
Crowns, and then she ordering him to bring them into her Chamber, went to a
Coffer, and taking thence the Purse, tied it fast to her Girdle: which was what
Andolocia looked for, who whilst she was telling out the Money, clasped her fast
by the Arm, and throwing her upon his back, he wished himself in a Solitary
Desert: and immediately they were both carried out of sight, to the great
amazement of those that beheld it, and were not let down till they came into
Ireland; then Aggrypina being faint, Andolocia placed her under a Tree, on
which were many Apples, exceeding fair to appearance: whenas she made her
request to Andolocia, that if he had any pity of a poor distressed Virgin, he
would get her something to quench her thirst, or she should faint; with that he
taking pity of her, as loving her still, although she had so misused him, he
got up the tree, and through carelessness left the Hat upon her Head, and the
Jewels in her lap, who whilst he was plucking the Apples, said, Woe is me! how
came I hither into this forlorn and desert place? O! how unlike is this to my
Father's Country, I would to God I were in my Father's Palace again: the which
when Andolocia heard, he hasted down the Tree to stay her flight, but she was
gone, past recovery, in a moment, with the Purse, Hat, and Jewels, which vexed
Andolocia worse than before: whereupon he began to Curse the Destinies, and the
Hour wherein he was borne, saying, that now he was quite undone, and his loss
unreparable! When he had bewailed his misfortune a good while, he being faint
and dry eat the Apples, upon which he felt a sudden pain in his Head, which
made him suppose they were infectious; but it continued not long, before a
large pair of Goats Horns sprung up, at which he was sore affrighted, and would
have fled from repetitive woodcut of single tree woodcut of two men standing
and one flying him ^^t had it been possible; and began more than before to
exclaim against his hard Fate, saying, that now such a misfortune was befell
him, as would exclude him from the Honor and Society of men; then began he to
Curse the time when he first came into England; and wished that he had died in
the Womb, or as soon as ever he beheld the light: Cursing and Railing against
the Enchanting beauty of Aggrypina, which had wrought him all this disgrace,
and misery; vowing, if possible, to be revenged; and was grown so desperate,
that he resolved to sell his Soul to the Devil, rather then she should go
unpunished. And in this mad mode he ranged the Forest, for two days space,
without meeting either Man or Beast: till at last he came to a Cave under a
spreading Oak, wherein lived an aged Hermet, who not only calmed his desperate
resolves, but likewise cured him of his Horns, as shall in the next Chapter he
shown at large.

CHAP. XXXVI.
How Andolocia, by the advice of an Hermet, was eased of his Horns, and how he
came into England, and grafted a pair of Goats Horns upon the Head of Aggrypina.

WHen the Hermet perceived Andolocia, he came out of his Cell, and demanded
what business brought him into such a disconsolate and desert place? and withal
smiled when he beheld the Horns upon his Head, as well knowing what had caused
them: to whom Andolocia replied with a doleful tone, truly, I was brought
hither by the Air, and remained here full sore against my will; but yet, I
woodcut of a man unlocking a door with four men standing behind him; repeated
from p. 32 repetitive woodcut of multiple trees must thank God that I have
found you here to be my comfort, for I never intend to go to any Town, unless I
can be rid of this deformity, which proceeded from eating Apples in this
Wilderness; at which the Old Man laughed heartily, and the rather, to see what
a piteous wry face Andolocia made; at which Andolocia being somewhat
displeased, told him, that he ought rather to comfort him than to increase his
affliction: Yes, said the Hermit, I shall comfort you, and therefore come into
my house, and in two hours space I Will cause thee to shed thy Horns. At this
Andolocia greatly rejoiced, and told the Hermit, that if he would do so, he
would give him 10 Crowns; keep your Money, said the Hermit, and corrupt not me
with it, for if I had delighted in Riches I had not come to this place, neither
need I now to live here: then Andolocia asked the old man for something to eat,
who brought him out Roots, Nuts, Field-Apples, and a cruise of Water, which was
all the fare he lived on; then desired he would begin to cure him of his Horns;
at which the Hermit went out of his Cave, and returning again about half an
hour after, brought six Apples of a very fair color with him, and wished
Andolocia to eat two of them; the which he had no sooner done, but his Horns
dropped off, at which he was exceeding glad, and asked the Hermit how those
Fruits came to be of such different qualities? to which he answered, The Wise
Creator and Sovereign Lord of all things had so disposed his bounties, that
seldom there is any thing hurtful, but there is likewise another thing to cure
the hurt that it causes; but in all the Earth I believe there is not two Trees
that retain the like qualities of these Trees.

Now after they had held a long discourse about the business of the World, the
Hermit bid Andolocia be mindful of the future state of his precious and
immortal Soul: and so guiding him to the next Town, he dismissed him with his
Blessing; and Andolocia on the other hand, returned him a thousand Thanks. Then
went Andolocia to the next Inn and called for Meat and Drink, afterward he
departed thence toward the Seaside, studying all the way how he might be
revenged on Agrippina; and having some of the Hornifying Apples in his Pocket,
as likewise four of the contrary quality, which the Hermit had given him, he
resolved to go for London, and if possible, to graft a pair of Horns upon the
head of Agrippina, by which means he doubted not to recover his Hat and Purse;
in order to which, he agreed with the Master of the Vessel to carry him into
England; when coming to London, he disguised himself, and so went to the Court,
and there putting his Apples in a Box, he set them forth just as the Princess
was coming by: and when any one asked him what Fruit they were, he told them
they were brought from Jerusalem, and that they grew in the Holy Garden; which
made many inquire the price, but he held them so dear that none would buy; it
not being his intent that any should experiment the secret; he had not long
continued before Agrippina came by, and casting her eyes upon them, she not
being accustomed to see such kind of Fruit, demanded what they were? then her
Gentlewoman told her; whereupon she made toward Andolocia, and taking one up
in her hand, asked the price? which he told her was 3 Crowns the least; for,
says he, I have not above Twenty of them, and it has cost me a twelve-months
Travel to fetch them; some, it is true, I disposed of in the Court of France,
where they are highly approved for their virtue. Well, and what virtue, said
the Princess, do they contain? Such, said Andolocia, that if you were old they
would restore both Youth and Beauty; they are not only pleasant to taste, but
have such a miraculous secret, that they once being eaten, preserve health for
7 Years after; but how many, said Agrippina? only Two, said Andolocia. Upon
this, the Princess, who was sometimes troubled with Fits, bought Two of them,
but would give him no more than two Crowns a piece and putting them in her
Handkerchief, departed; which did not make Andolocia a little rejoice; so
staying about the Court, he perceived by the melancholy temper of her
waiting-Gentlewoman that the project had taken effect; for so it was, that when
the Princess came into her Chamber, she eat one of the Apples, and finding it
had a luscious taste, eat, in a while afterward, another; then lying down to
sleep, as was her usual custom, she found her self somewhat indisposed, but
yet slept for half an hour; during which space, she Dreamed that a great
He-Goat came running at her, and butted with his Horns; whereupon she striving
to fly, found her self turned into a Goat also; at which being much
affrighted, she awoke, when starting up, she felt a more then usual weight upon
her head; when looking in the Glass, she espied a great pair of Horns fixed
upon her head, whereat she shrieked out, so that her Gentlewomen came running,
and when they beheld her, they shrieked also; but the old Matron who was her
Tutor, being wiser then the rest, bid them keep silence; for, said she, if this
be noised abroad, the greatest Beauty upon Earth will loose her credit amongst
Men; but the best way will be to procure such able Physicians as may take them
away: then asked she of Agrippina, which way she deemed that they happened? to
which Agrippina replied, I know not, unless it be some immediate judgment
showed upon me for my too great opinion of my beauty, or the effects of the
strange Fruit I bought of the Merchant; but however they came, I pray you seek
some means by which I may be rid of them, whatever it cost me, before it comes
to be blazed about in the World; whereupon the old Woman went to all the noted
Physicians, and acquainted them what had happened to a fair young Gentlewoman,
but told them not her name; then many of them desired to see her, but she told
them that might not be, unless unsight or unseen they would promise and oblige
themselves in an obligation of 2000 Crowns if they performed it not; but they
looking upon it as a strange and unheard of matter, would not undertake it upon
such conditions; so that the old Matron was returning home sad and heavy that
she had not sped: when Andolocia who had watched her all the while, meeting her
at a turning, being now in the habit of a Doctor with great false, Whiskers,
and other disguises, drew near and saluted her, saying, What makes you so sad,
is not some one of your friends well? for so I do guess, because I see you come
out of such a Doctor's house: Truly, said she, there is something more than
ordinary that makes me thus: then said Andolocia, be not afraid to discover it,
for by my skill and God's blessing, I have done miraculous Cures, left off by
other Physicians.

When the Matron heard him say so, she greatly rejoiced, and declared to him in
all points what had happened, which was to him no news; and desired him to stay
till she went and acquainted the young Gentlewoman with it, and she would
return to him within an hour: the which he promised to do; so that when the Old
Gentlewoman returned, she enjoined him to keep secrecy, and to promise the
payment of 2000 Crowns if he did not perform the Cure, and then she led him up
a back way into Agrippina's Chamber.

CHAP. XXVII.
How Andolocia, by undertaking to Cure Agrippina of her Horns, first recovered
his Wishing-Hat, and afterward his Purse, with what happened during the time.

NOw when Andolocia was brought into Agrippina's presence, and beheld her
Horns, he inwardly rejoiced, though to appearance he seemed sorry; then, said
he, fair Lady, be not dejected, for I shall surely Cure you of your Horns: if
you do, said Agrippina, I will bountifully reward you; fear it not, said
Andolocia; in the same case was an Earl's Daughter in Flanders for making false
vows to her Lover and never performing them, yet I cured her: then began
Aggripina to sigh, as imagining her breach of Faith with Andolocia might have
brought upon her that disgrace, then she desired him to keep it secret, and so
gave him a 100 Crowns, upon which he went to the Apothecaries, and there, for
fashions sake, bought several Drugs, with which he mixed some slices of the
Aples, whose quality it was to take away Horns: which working with her, she
soon perceived her Horns to diminish; at which she greatly rejoiced: but
Andolocia was resolved not quite to rid her of them, till such time he found
opportunity to recover his Hat and Purse. A while after he caused an Ape to be
killed, and wrapped the skin about her Horns, which she patiently endured: then
he gave her more of the Aple, which made them sink so far, that they were
scarce a handful long; so he ordered her to go to sleep again: when as he
taking his opportunity, searched about to see if peradventure he could chance
on the Hat or Purse, and had the good luck to find his Wishing Hat where it was
carelessly laid under the bed, Aggrippina not in the least knowing the secret
virtue that remained in it; at which good hap Andolocia greatly rejoiced, and
took it as a happy Presage that he should recover his Purse likewise; for now,
thought he, I will take another airy Voyage with her and the Purse, to see if
he could be more circumspect then formerly. Whilst he was thus debating, he,
unseen of the Princess, took up the Hat and put it under his Coat, and
thereupon began to relent of the intended Cruelty he designed to use toward
where; which was, That when her Horns were almost gone, he would give her two
Hornifying Apples that should make them rise again larger than ever, and then
to depart from France, and from thence to send her a Letter, who he was, and
upon what occasion her Horns were grown, and that unless she would come to him
and bring the Purse, she should never be cured of the same; whilst thus he was
considering, Aggrypina waked, and feeling on her brows, found that her Horns
were almost gone, at which she rejoiced exceedingly: and for Andolocia,
desiring him to perfect his cure as soon as possible, but he told her it was
not so easily done, for that the greatest part was yet remaining, which was the
taking the root of the Horns out of the Skull; for which he must use many
costly Drugs, rarely to be got, and then told her she should appear more
beautiful and splendid, then ever: this made her rejoice the more, and
promised him any reward he would ask: for, said she, if this disgrace continue
by me, I shall be ashamed ever to appear in public. Well, said Andolocia, as
for the taking them away, I do not in the least doubt, but the Drugs will cost
a great deal of money: no matter for that, spare for no money, said Aggrypina,
for whatever it cost, I care not: nay, but said Andolocia, I have not money
enough to purchase the third part of them, of my own, therefore your highness
must disburst 500 Crowns at least, for there must be many ingredients; as,
Pearl, Corral, Rubies, Ambergris, Civit, Opopanax, Galbanum, Frankensence,
Mirh, and other costly things; upon which Aggrypina not knowing whom she had to
deal withal, putting on her Clothes, went to a large Cabbinet, in which all her
treasure lay, and after she had unlocked it, took out the so much desired
Purfe, and fastened it to her Girdle as she was wont upon the like occasion;
Andolocia well noteing, drew her toward the Window, and there set open the
Casement, telling her that he was dim-sighted and could not well see his money
in a dark room: whereupon, as she began to tell out the money he claped on his
Hat, which till then he had held privately under his Coat, and clasping her
fast, wished himself in a solitary Desert: the which he no sooner had done, but
they were hoisted up the Air, and carried invisibly over many Citys and Towns
till repetitive woodcut of single tree woodcut of Aggrypina in bed with horns,
Andolocia bowing before her; Aggrypina and Andolocia running together they came
to a Desert in Scotland, where he set her down: and then, that she should be no
longer ignorant by what means she had been thus conveyed away (for she thought
certainly the Devil had carried her) he pulled off his disguise, and told her
plainly who he was, upon which she was not able to speak, for a good space. Now
when she was carried away, her Women were in great perplexity, some weeping,
and others tearing their hair, insomuch that their Lamentations being heard,
the King and Queen supposed the Princess was Dead, for that they had notice she
was sick some time before: whereupon they came into her Lodgings, and demanded
the cause of such extravagant sorrow; whereupon the Old Woman with much sobing
and sighing told them, that the fair Aggrypina was again carried away, as
before: by one that pretended himself a Physician, and undertook to cure her of
certain Horns, which by a strange accident grew monstrously out of her Head: at
this, they were both grieved, but comforted themselves in hopes she would
return as she had done before: but when several days were over, and she came
not, they began to despair of her recovery.

Then said the King, I wish I had never persuaded her to bereave Andolocia of
his enchanted Purse: for had he kept that still, we had had our Daughter: for
past doubt, he is a Negromancer himself, or deals with such as are, and by that
means has these two times conveyed her away: and I am verily persuaded, that
the Merchant and the Physician were no other than Andolocia under disguise; but
I well trust, that he is of so courteous a temper, that he will do our Daughter
no harm: but when he has obliged her to return him his Purse, he will send her
home again: for it is certain, that Purse cannot be quietly enjoyed by any but
the true owner, which is Andolocia; therefore were my Aggrypina here, I did not
care she should any more be troubled with it; but if I might get it, I would
send it to Andolocia, and excuse her taking it from him. After this, the Queen
urged him to send forth messengers, not only into all parts of his own
Dominions, but likewise into Foreign parts, which he commanded to be speedily
done, and so departed sorrowfully to his Chamber: where I must leave him, and
return into Scotland, to Andolocia and Aggrypina.

When Aggrypina was come to her self, and able to speak, she fell upon her
knees, and besought Andolocia to have mercy upon her: for that she confessed
she had greatly injured him, for which she was heartily sorry: and it was true,
it lay in his power to revenge it, but that such a revenge would stain his
Glorious Deed in Arms, if once it came to light, as it was most likely it
would; for, said she, Murder is not rarely concealed long, the guilty
conscience of the Murderer being often constrained to discover it; but this
did not abate Andolocia's anger, who fiercely replied, well may you blush with
shame and confusion of face, since you have so treacherously dealt with one,
who loved you beyond all earthly things; discovering to you that secret, which
all the Racks and Tortures upon Earth, could never have obliged him to have
done: tremble therefore at your guilt, for see revenge is written in my brow,
and upon that, he laid his hand upon his Sword; which Aggrypina perceiving,
that no other, but that he intended to dispatch her, and therefore through fear
and grief, she fell into a swound, which moved Andolocia to pity; so that he
gently raised her from the ground, and she recovering, began to beg him to
pity her, pity you! said Andolocia, what pity can there remain in my breast
for such an one who so treacherously and ungratefully rewarded me for all the
hazards that I underwent for your sake? and know you shall ware the infamy on
your front, as an everlasting Memento of your Infidelity. Then said Aggrypina,
I desire you to place me in some Nunnery, thereby to keep me from the sight of
People, to which Andolocia consented.

CHAP. XXXVIII.
How Andolocia put Aggrypina in a Nunnery, and departed with his Hat and Purse
to Famogosta.

ANdolocia having found a Nunnery, knocked at the Door, and desired to speak
with the Matron, who after some time, came and demadded his business? who told
her, that he would gladly speak with her in private, whereupon she took him by
the hand, and led him into the Lodge; where he told her, that a strange accident
had happened to a Lady of great birth and beauty, which was, that she had two
Horns growing out of her head, upon that the Matron wondered, and was greatly
desirous to see her: whereupon he went and fetched: Aggrypina (who waited for
his return, not far thence:) when he brought her: the Abbess wondered yet more,
but did not seem to take any notice of the Horns, for fear of displeasing
Aggrypina, but went to her and embraced her, biding her heartily welcome:
perceiving her partly demean, and that she had been exceedingly well bred: then
did they demand of Andolocia 200 Crowns, which she said was the Custom of the
House, when any Young Lady first entered, and that afterward they had servants
assigned to attend them after the best manner: upon this Andolocia took out his
Purse, and gave her 300 Crowns, saying, there is one hundred more than you
asked; therefore let the Lady be carefully looked to, which the Matron promised.

CHAP. XXXIX.
How Andolocia returned to his Brother Ampedo, with the Hat and Purse: and how
at the request of the King of Cyprus, he freed Aggrypina out of the Nunnery,
and took away her Horns.

ANdolocia being rid of Aggrypina, departed joyfully with his Purse and Hat,
and being out of sight, he wished himself in Flanders, whether he was conveyed
in a trice; and there for some time solacing himself in pleasure, he fell in
love with an Earl's daughter, to whom he imparted the secret of his Hat, which
she privily intended to steal from him by night: but he having notice of it
from one of her Virgins; to whom she had revealed it by reason of his often
repeated liberalities toward her, he took the opportunity to prevent her by
wishing himself in Cyprus, which he instantly accomplished; where he no sooner
arrived, but he hired him servants, and bought both himself and them Horses,
and then in a most splendid manner rode to Famogosta; the which when he
approached, his Brother Ampedo espying him from the Batalments of his Palace,
he did not a little rejoice; and withal, called to his servants to make ready
his Horses, and so rode out to meet him; when they came near each other, both
of them alighted and embraced each other, neither, for a while, being able to
speak, for joy: after which, Ampedo asked Andolocia how he had sped, who with a
cheerful countenance replied, that he had recovered his Purse again, which did
not a little rejoice Ampedo.

After much discourse relating to their Travels, they came to the Palace,
where Ampedo ordered a sumptuous Feast to be prepared, to welcome his Brother,
to which they invited several of their friends, to rejoice with them, and
continued in great merriment for two days; at the end of which, Andolocia
offered his Brother the Purse, but he refused it, saying, he had enough, and
that it caused great perplexity to such as kept it; and therefore he willed
Andolocia still to detain it, which did not at all displease him; for although
he offered it his Brother, yet he was in hopes that he would not accept of it.
When he had Revelled in the Palace for a while, he took leave of his Brother,
and went to the King's Court, where he no sooner arrived, but the King had
notice thereof, and sent one of his Chamberlains to bring him to his Presence;
where, when he was come, he made a low obeisance, after which the King welcomed
him, and asked him of his Travels, of which he gave a large account, relating
to the customs and fashions of the Countries through which he had passed: Then
the King demanded of him, whether he had been in the English Court; to which he
replied, he had: And have you, said the King, seen the Princess Agrypina? I
have, said Andolocia: But do you know whether she be found or not, since the
news I received that she was carried away by Negromancy? for I have a great
mind to lay down the ponderous weight of Government, if I could match my Son to
that Princess: Truly, said Andolocia, I must confess I know where she is, and
if your Majesty will send an Embassage with the Prince's Picture, I will so
order it, that she shall be at her fathers Court before the Ambassador arrives.
At this the King greatly rejoiced, and highly honored Andolocia, promising all
things should be done according to his directions, and desired him to make good
his word without delay; upon which he took his leave of the King; and after
having departed a mile from the Palace, he put on his Wishing-Hat, and was
immediately conveyed to the Nunnery, where knocking at the Gate, desired to
speak with the Matron, who no sooner came to him, but he showed her that he was
desirous to speak with Aggripina; whereupon she caused her to be called,
knowing him to be the person who had brought her thither: When Aggrypina, came,
she could not refrain from weeping; whereupon he taking her by the hand, led
her into a private Chamber, and told her, that he had been ranging the world
about, to find fit Medicines to cure her of her Horns; and demanded of her,
that if she were cured, whither she would wish her self to be? Why, said she,
with my Father, to enjoy my former Freedom in his Palace: Then, said he, be it
according to thy wish; and thereupon he gave her two Apples, which he had
reserved, the which she had no sooner eaten, but she shed her Horns; then he
called the Matron, and told her, that Aggrypina was a King's Daughter, and that
e're long she should be Married to a beautiful young Prince, and that, he
having cured her of her Horns, did now intend to take her with him. The Abbess
or Matron perceiving the wonderful change, greatly rejoiced, and praised God
that he had wrought such a miraculous alteration: Then Andolocia giving the
Matron 200 Crowns more, and to Aggrypina's waiting Maid, a hundred, he departed
with Aggrypina; and when he was come into a Forest, he put on his Wishing-Hat,
and taking her in his arms, wished himself in London, where he immediately
arrived; and there setting down the Princess Aggrypina, without any word
speaking, wished himself as Famagosta, and was there in a trice: Now Aggrypina
perceiving that she was at London, enquired the way to her Father^ Palace,
where she soon arrived, by the directions of the Citizens.

CHAP. XL.
How Aggrypina came again to the King and Queen; and how an Ambassador came
from Cyprus to demand her in Marriage; together with her Marriage to the King
of Cyprus.

AGgrypina no sooner arrived at the Palace, but she was met by some of the
Ladies that had formerly waited upon her, who could not speak to her for joy,
but immediately run to the King and Queen to inform them what they had seen;
upon which the King ordered a hundred pieces of gold, to be given to the first
bringer of the news, and immediately went to meet Aggrypina, greatly rejoicing
that he had recovered her; upon which occasion, he proclaimed a great Feast
throughout all his dominions, which was kept with great rejoicing; in the
midst of which, an Ambassador came from Cyprus, of which the King having
notice, caused him to be nobly entertained, and the next day he was introduced
to his Audience, he being attended by many Nobles of Cyprus.

When he came into the King's presence, he declared his Ambassy, and delived
his Masters Letters; showing likewise, the young Princ's Picture, which greatly
pleased the King and Queen; then was the Picture ordered to be carried to
Aggrypina; as likewise the Relation of what had passed; the which, when she
beheld, she at first, with feigned Modesty, disapproved of; but casting to mind
what Andolocia had said, she consented; then were the King's Ships made ready,
and a great number of Noble Ladies appointed to carry her over; when taking
leave of the King and Queen, she departed, though not without some tears on
either side; for that having a prosperous Gale, within two months they Landed
in that Island; whereof notice being had, the King, his Queen, and all the
Nobles of that Kingdom, came to welcome her on shore, with all manner of
Music, and what ever could he invented, to entertain one of such Noble Birth;
all the people rejoicing that they had so fair a Princess to be hereafter their
Queen; then did (...) conduct her to the City of Medusa, where the King's
Palace was; against whose coming, a stately Banquet was prepared; and the more
to delight repetitive woodcut of single tree woodcut of a feast and hunting the
company, a Conjuror caused a Tree to grown on the Table, and a Hunting to pass
along, for their Diverisement. Likewise, Andolocia attended, but would by no
means take any notice of Aggrypina, for so it was secretly agreed between them;
but he spent so Royally, that all the Nobility envyed him, by reason he
ecclipsed their Honors, in doing so far beyond their Abilities, by giving the
Prince and Princess a Present of Jewels worth a hundred Crowns; as likewise
sending in such store of choice Vsands and Wine, that the King greatly
marvelled.

CHAP. XLI.
How at the Sports and Pastimes ordained to grace the Wedding, Andolocia won
the praise; which caused some of the Nobility greatly to envy him.

DVring the Feast the K. ordained several Sports, as (...) T^^nantenes, and
fighting at Bor^^ets; wherein Andolocia (...) prevailed, th^^^ won the praise
of all Ladies and Gentlewomen, and was by the Princess Aggrypina often Crowned
with Garlands; which raised the envy of many of the great ones against him,
insomuch that two Earls, viz. the Earl of Limose and Armandalia, secretly
conspired his death, because he had obtained the Wreath several times, by
putting them to the foil; so that they resolved to ^^y wait for him in a Wood,
through which he was to pass; for at that time he had not brought with him the
Wishing-Hat, and resolv^d to kill all his Men, and by putting him upon the
Rack, oblige him to confess from whence he had such store of Treasure:
Whereupon the day before the Feast ended, they took their leave of the King, as
if they intended to go a Hunting; and having got about 200 arm^d men, they
placed themselves behind certain Trees in the Wood, near to the way he was to
pass, and furiously setting upon him at unawares, they killed all his Men,
which were 6 in umber, and took him Prisoner, though not without loss on their
side, for Andolocia drawing his Sword, so laid about him, that he killed ten of
their (...), and wounded the Earl of Limose.

CHAP. XLII.
How Andolocia was Imprisoned and Racked, and how Ampedo burned his
Wishing-Hat, as imagining his Brother slain.

WHen the Earls had taken Andolocia Prisoner, they carried him to a Castle of
theirs not far from thence, where they put him into a dark Prison, and rode
again to Court, carrying with them 4 fat Bucks, which they pretended to have
taken by hunting. Soon after their arrival, news was brought of the death of
Andolocia's men, and how that he was thought to be taken Prisoner, by reason
his body was not found amongst them, upon which, the King was exceeding angry;
and immediately sent out Messengers into all parts of the Kingdom; to hear of
him: As likewise Ampedo offered a 1000 Ducats to any that could discover where
he was; but when no tidings could he had where he was, he supposed him dead, or
in some dismal prison; for the sake of his Purse; and thereupon left he should
come to some ill end, by reason of his Hat, he cast it into the fire, and there
let it consume to ashes, and for grief, within a short time after dyed. Now
when the Earls had been at Court some time, the Earl of Limose went to see what
was become of Andolocia, and at his arrival, found him in the prison where he
left him, and there began to examine him where he had so much money to spend at
the rate he did? he told him, that if he would let him go to the Palace at
Famagosta, he would show him by what means he obtained his Riches; but he would
not consent to it, but caused him grievously to be Racked; insomuch that he was
obliged to discover the secrets of his Purse, and he delivered it to the Earl
in hopes, by that means, to be set free; but he having proved it, left him in
Prison, and rode to his Companion, and showed him all that had happenned;
whereupon they, after some contest agreed to keep it monthly by turns; then the
Earl of Armandolia said, I hear that Andolocia is a Negromancer, and can fly
in the air: therefore we cannot be safe till he is dispatched out of the way,
to which they both agreed, and the Earl of Armandolia rode to the prison, and
offered the Keeper 200 Crowns to strangle Andolocia, but he refused it, saying,
he was a just and honest man: whereupon the Earl went in himself, and after
having asked wheher he had any more Purses of the same sort, and he affirming
he had none, the Earl with his Girdle, strangled him, as he sat fast in a large
pair of Stocks, and so returned to the Earl of Limose, to acquaint him with
what he had done.

CHAP. XLII.
How the Murder of Andolocia was discovered by the two Earls falling out about
the Purse, and how they were put to death for the same.

ANdolocia and Ampedo being dead, the Purse lost all its virtue, and would
yield no more Money than any common Purse; so that it falling to the Earl of
Armandalia's turn, he taxed the Earl of Limose as a Cheat, saying, he had
changed it; so that there happened a dispute between them; whereupon they drew
their Swords and wounded each other; when as the people coming in to part them,
the Earl of Limose said; Ah Villain! then would have Murdered me as thou
did Andolocia for his Purse; which words being told to the King, he suspected
them to be the Murderers: Whereupon he commanded they should be Apprehended
and Racked; during which, they freely confessed all that had passed, and were
Condemned to be broken upon the Wheel, their Chattels and Goods to be spotted,
and so many as were consenting or privy to the Murder, to be Hanged; which
Sentance was accordingly put in Execution: After which, by reason Andolocia and
Ampedo had left none to possess their Palace at Famagosta, the King took
possession thereof, and found in it infinite Wealth, placing the Prince and
Princess therein, who lived there in great Splendour, till the King's Death, and
then took upon them the Rule of the whole Kingdom.
