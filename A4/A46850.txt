A visitation of LOVE unto the tender plants of Gods Vineyard.
DEar and tender plants of my heavenly Father, the salutation of my love dearly
does greet you all, in the spirit that gives life, by which you are brought
afresh to my remembrance, even at this present time, (in these my present
bonds, for the word of God, and the testimony of Christ Jesus:) and that not
without living breathings ariseing in my heart unto the Lord for you, that the
God of all life, virtue, and living refreshment may daily water and nourish you
with his heavenly life, love, and virtue, causing you to abound in all the
fruits of righteousness, to the everlasting praise of his great and glorious
Name; that so you being fully rooted, fixed, and established, in the root of
life ( the stem and offspring of David) may grow up as plants of
righteousness, and flourish as Willows by the water courses, that your branches
may never wither, nor your fruit perish: but that the virtue of your leaf may
be for the healing of the Nations, and your fruit may remain, (in the winter
storms and tempests,) to the everlasting praise and glory of the Lord God of
the vineyard, who has planted and watered you, and who also has and will
give an increase unto all you, who exalt not above the root, nor lift up your
selves against the other branches, but abides in the true vine, and keeps your
place in the ground and root of life, into which the Father has implanted and
grafted you, that ye never may be plucked up, nor cut off as withered and
unfruitful branches, but that the virtue of the root of life, may put forth it
self through you, and in the virtue and life thereof you may grow up,
fructify, and abound in all the fruits of righteousness, thankesgiving and
praise, to the everlasting glory and renown of the Lord of the vineyard, who is
God over all, blessed for evermore.

And dear and tender plants, this is with me further to signify unto you that
it was purposed in my heart to have visited you, in the bowels of eternal
love, (with my dear and honorable Brother and companion in the Lord W. D.) But
Satan has hindered us, who in Ages and Generati^^s past, sought to withstand
the servants of the most high God, and even ^^w also, works mightily in the
hearts of unreasonable and wicked men, ^eeking to stir up wrath against us,
and to cast our bodies into prison, thereby intending to let and hinder the
work of the Lord, and to stop the wells of Jacob, by depriving the heritage of
the Lord, of those precious and refreshing oportunities, which our God has
afforded us, in our holy assemblings and comings together to wait upon him, to
be strengthened and refreshed by him, and to build up, strengthen and comfort
one another, in the most holy says, even with the same strength, virtue, and
consolation, wherewith we our selves are strengthened, comforted and refreshed
of our God. And glory be to the Lord God for ever, concerning this I am fully
assured, that the expectation of the wicked one herein shall be frustrated, and
that the God of all comfort and consolation has and does answer the request of
our souls concerning you, who abide faithful to him, in the light of his
everlasting covenant, in that he will manifest his heavenly virtue with you,
whether together or assunder as outwardly, and open the spring of eternal life
in you: and therein make you as a wellspring of living refreshment one unto
another. And though he has permitted the adversary so far to prevail against
us, or to exercise his rage on us, as to cast our bodies into prison, (is he
did the very dearest Saints and servants of the God of Heaven in the days
past: yet herein also I am fully confident, that the wrath of men shall be
turned to the praise of our God, and the remainder thereof he will restrain,
and so concerning this I am fully satisfied, and rest in peace in the (will or
rather) permission of our God, believing assuredly that this also shall work
for our consolation, that the depth of the riches of Gods love unto us ward may
more abundantly be made manifest, both in the preservation and deliverance of
us, in his own appointed time, until which we rest in the will of our God,
(being singly given up, that, that may be done by us, and fulfilled in us.) In
which rest ye with us my dear friends, for though in bodily presence, we are
separated from you, and let from visiting of you, (for a little season) yet
in spirit we are with you, and in the bowels of eternal love, our hearts are
enlarged toward you, much more then what is needful to be expressed in lines
of this kind, seeing in the word of the Lord God you may read us and feel us
near unto you, and with you all, even as in an epistle written in your hearts to
be seen and read by you all.

Wherefore in that receive ye a visitation of tender love from him that travels
in spirit, (although outwardly in bonds) for your preservation, growth, and
prosperity every way in Gods precious truth, by which you were at first
convinced, for there is not preservatian, growth, nor any true prosperity in or
by another, then in that which has been declared of unto you, from the
beginning, even the light of Christ Jesus, the word of the gospel of truth, by
which at first your hearts were opened and turned toward the Lord, and
repentance given unto life never to be repented of, and faith toward our Lord
Jesus Christ, and fervent love begotten in your hearts one toward another, by
which word of the Gospel my heart is enlarged unto you, in an abundant manner,
and therein also let me enlarge my self a little, by writing a few lines unto
you in simplicity and truth, though you need it not, who are taught by the
anointing that dwells in you, in all things, and your hearts established in
righteousness, yet seeing all a^e not come so far, that are convinced of the
truth of God, bear with me a little ye that are strong, if I write a few words
in general by way of caution, or to put you afresh in remembrance.

O you dear and tender plants of my Father, that ye be watchful at all times,
and take heed of that which would exalt you above your root, or draw you into
highness and loftiness of mind, above the feeling of the daily cross, kept
over and above the earthly or fl^shly part, for that is to be beat down, and
kept in subjection, or else it will cause you to wither and dry up at the root,
if that be nourished and cherished in you, which the Lord God hates and
resists: but he gives grace to the humble, wherefore, my dear friends in
lowliness of heart and mind, walk ye in the daily cross unto that part and
nature, which would crucify the Son of God afresh, and cause you to build
again those things, which you once destroyed, by getting up into a fleshly
liberty and exaltation, which is not the liberty of the Sons of God [who have
dominion over that part, which would cause the offense of the cross to cease,]
for such as give way unto that, though they have begun in the Spirit, yet will
end in the flesh: and though they once might partake of the virtue of the root
of life, yet afterward degenerate from it, and bring not forth fruit unto God,
but both branch and fruit perishes: so against that, friends, all are to
watch, which would lead out into fleshly liberty, or into any exaltation of
flesh or spirit, [above the daily cross of Christ] how glorious soever it may
appear to the outward eye, yet a snare of death there is in it, and the virtue
of the precious life will withdraw it self from such as follow it, and though
they may flourish as a green bay tree [in the profession of truth] yet the
virtue of the root of life having withdrawn it self, their leaf will shortly
wither, and they become as corn that grows on the house top, that brings not
forth fruit to perfection.

And therefore my dear friends, the word of exhortatation, which arises in my
heart unto you all is, dwell low in the fear of the Lord God, and in humility
of heart walk with him, in the measure of that grace ye have received of him,
for that is safe for you all, and to him that has shall be given, that he may
have in abundance, but unto him that has not profited, in that which he has,
even that which he has shall be taken from him. Watch you therefore my dear
friends, that a daily profiting you may know, in that tallent which is
committed unto you, for there is no profiting in or by another, nor by what
another has received of it: but by abideing in that which ye have received of
God in your own perticulars: that you may feel that grow and increase in you,
and you in it until it have wholly leavened you into its own proper virtue and
nature; and thereby an entrance is and will be administered unto you more and
more into that which is eternal, even into the kingdom and life of our Lord
Jesus Christ: and you will feel an habitation in that, and and a sitting down
in it, which indeed is exceeding precious, and will countervaile all your
sufferings, labors, and travels for it. And that you will feel raised up in
you, which serves God as naturally, and does his will, unto which his commands
are not grevious, but joyous, nor is his yoke burdensome, but this brings
forth fruit naturally unto God: for indeed it is of him and from him, and not
of this world, but born from above, and seeks those things that are eternal,
and to be unto God in deed, in truth, and in righteousness, and though this
brings forth the works of God outwardly before men, and stands singly given up
in body soul and spirit to serve him in all things; and to do his will, that
therein the Father may be glorified, yet it does not seek to appear before men,
nor to be approved by men in any thing, but to answer the Lord in all things:
and to stand approved in his sight, and unto his witness in every conscience,
and this is the son of God for ever, and heir of the Kingdom, and a plant of
the right hand of the God of Heaven, which naturally brings forth fruit to
the praise of the Lord of the vineyard, who has planted and watered it. And so
dear friends feel this in you, all raised up, begotten and brought forth, for
this will the Lord God cherish, [as a Father his only begotten:] and this
shall receive the rain in due season, even the former and latter rain, the dew
of Heaven, and the fatness of the good ground shall daily water and nourish
this in the root, and in the branch: and though the briars and thorns may seek
to smother this, yet the fire of the Lord shall consume them, and every plant
that the Father has not planted, which seeks to hinder the growth of this, the
axe of the Lord shall cut them up: so that the leaves of this shall never
wither, nor its blossoms perish; the scorching heat in the Summer, nor the
stormy blasts in the Winter, shall have no power over it, because it is rooted
in an eternal ground of life, and watered with the dew of of Heaven which
causes it to flourish and blossom in due season, and bring forth fruit to
perfection, to the everlasting glory and renown of the Lord of the Vineyard,
over all who is blessed for evermore.

And so dear Plants of my heavenly Father, recieve ye my words in the word of
life from whence they were written, and therein also may you read, feel, and
receive the thing I testify of, and exhort unto, even the engrafted word which
is able to save your souls, that by it you may have power over that whether in
your selves or in others, which would draw you from the root of life, [or word
engrafted] in your own particulars, for that is your enemy, and to be watched
and warred against, (which would draw you from that) in whatever appearance it
may come unto you in, that as an Angel of light to draw you from the light of
life revealed in you, or from the present sensible feeling of your own
particular estate and conditions in it, into something before or behind, which
may seem glorious unto the eye that is abroad, saying, Lo here, or there, is
the Kingdom of God, in this, or that, or the other observation, and thereby
seek to raise up a covetting or longing desire, to be in another state or
condition, in a higher or more glorious state or dispensation, then what you
are grown into, by the light of life, the manifestation of Gods spirit, which
is given unto you to profit withal; but I say unto you go not forth, but
abide with the Lord in that which ye have received of him, that by it a growth
and entrance may be administered unto you, into the Kingdom in deed, and in
truth; for the Kingdom of God comes not by observation of this, or that, or
the other thing, nor yet stands it in high words, or gilded and coined
expressions, but in judgment and mercy, in peace, in truth, and in
righteousness, and happy are they that enter it through judgment and
righteousness, and sit down in it, in the peace that endures for ever, and
goes no more forth to the right hand, nor to the left, for the things that are
behind also, may the enemy tempt you withal, to draw back your minds from the
Lord, into the glory of Egypt, the thing which you have once turned your backs
upon, even the fading enjoyments of this present life, saying, All this will I
give thee, if thou will (...) down and worship me; then safe will such be as
dwell in the daily ^rosse, whereby the world is Crucified unto them, and they
unto the world, that so the wicked one may have no part in them, because they
are passed from death unto life, feeding of, and being clothed with that which
is immortal, and never perishes, their life standing in an eternal root, who
have the Lord for their portion, such cannot with Esau sell their birthright
for a mess of Pottage; nor with Demas choose this present world, and forsake
the way of truth, for in them the temptation of the enemy has no place, they
living in that immortal and eternal principle of life, which first convinced
them of the evil of the world, and the spirit of wickedness in high places,
that accursed root which brings no^ forth fruit unto God, in which they were
once branches, but are now broken off, that they might be ingrafted, and for
ever abide in another, but whoever return into the old root and nature again,
will become as withered branches twice dead plucked up by the roots.

You therefore, my dear friends, that know a cutting off from the old root, and
a grafting again into the true Vine the light of life, and word of the Lord
God, by which your hearts are in measure cleansed, sanctified and purified from
the pollutions of the world, abide ye in that word for ever, and go not forth
to look for, or covet after another dispensation of life or glory, nor seek not
another Kingdom besides that which is revealed in the light, which as ye abide
in it, an entrance will be administered into it from day to day, and a growth
into that state and condition, which the high and lofty spirits, which have
left their habitations, and are exalted above the root of life in themselves
fall short of, though they may have great swelling words, of those things which
they have not witnessed, tasted nor handled of, being vainly puffed up in their
fleshly minds, and boast of things above their line, or of the estate whereunto
they have not attained.

But this I say unto you, my dear friends, go not forth unto any of these
exalted spirits, in any of these glorious temptations, which promises great
things, but there is a lie in (that which may seem to be) their right hand, and
therefore go not forth, but abide with the Lord for ever, in the measure of
his eternal truth which changes not, (though many may turn from it,) nor
waxes not old, but abides the same for ever, for there is your safety. And as
you abide in this, and stand singly girt up in it, here no deceitful spirits
can come nor enter, but they will be seen and judged, whether they come from
within, or from without, and whatever their covering or appearance may be, yet
being out of the virtue and savor of life their root and ground will be seen,
discovered, and judged, and so (...) kept clean, pure, and holy in the eternal
light and life of God, in which (...) live walk and will have dominion over all
unclean and fallen spirit, who are gone from their first principle, and erred
from the light of life, which was sown in them.

And so you dear and tender plants of my heavenly Father, abide ye in the true
Vine the light of life, which the Father has sown in you, that for ever ye may
be rooted, fixed, and established in it, and bring forth fruit to perfection,
that the root of bitterness, and every plant which your heavenly Father has
not planted, may wholly be cut up and rooted out, by the two-^^ged Sword, the
Axe of the Lord God, that so the plant of righteousness may take root, and
grow up in you, wholly to cover the earth, as the waters covers the Sea, that
as you have born the Image of the earthly; so now you may bear the Image of the
heavenly, and may become a praise unto the Lord in your generation, and a
comfort, strengthening, and refreshing one unto another, serving the Lord with
a pure heart fervently, and one another in love, which is the end of all
ministrations, and the sum of the desire of our hearts concerning you, and
that for which our souls travels, that the love of God may abound in you; and
the God of love, peace, and mercy be with you, and establish your hearts, in
the everlasting Covenant of his light, life, and Salvation, that in it ye may
stand for ever, and bear a living testimony for him and his truth upon earth.
And that so it may be with you all, is the fervent Supplication of my soul in
the spirit that gives life, by which the endeared visitation, and salutation
of my love (first and last) reaches to you all. Farewell.

you, in the eternal ground and root of life, and amongst men by the name of

Yarmouth common Gaol the fourth day of the eight month. 1663.
MY dearly beloved Friends, who are sensible of the breathings of life in your
selves, and of the power of the everlasting Gospel of peace, my unfeigned
brotherly love flows, forth unto you, from the immortal life, which the God
of my life, has manifested in my mortal body, and with the salutation of this
my real love do I greet you all, whom God has called and chosen in these
perilous times: to be a peculiar people unto himself, to show forth his
praise, and not your own, to declare his wondrous works, and not your own, to
get honor and renown unto him in the earth, and not unto your selves: for he
has bought you with a price, therefore are you not your own, and he has
redeemed you from the corruptible, by that which is incorruptible, and
therefore how should you continue in that which is corruptible to the
satisfying your wills, and the wills of corruptible men, who are in the
corruptible, and in their unconverted estate, fulfiling their own wills:
showing forth their own praise, declaring their own works, admireing and
worshipping of them, and getting honor and renown unto themselves in the earth,
honoring, regarding and serving the Creatures more then the Creator, even as
we in the times of ignorance have done before the redemption [before mentioned
was witnessed] or the election known, which now many are made witnesses of,
glory be unto the most high for evermore.

Wherefore Friends, answer ye the Lords end in calling of you, and his end in
purchasing of you, and his end in redeeming of you, which may be answered by
your faithfulness unto the Lord, and in so doing every one will have his
reward with him, for every one that answers the Lords end, for which the Lord
called him: comes to enjoy his presence, comes to be filled with love, life,
joy and peace, and such do really show forth his praise, and declare his
wondrous works to the bringing of honor and renown unto him, and not unto
themselves: but they that are unfaithful and disobedient, though called, they
do not answer the end, for which they were called, and therefore does not the
Lord so reward them, through his dwelling with them, through filling them with
love, life, joy, and peace, as he rewards the other that are faithful, but on
the contrary they who are called and are not faithful, as to answer the end for
which they are called* they, (I say) are filled with sorrow, and unbelief, with
trouble, and anguish, and condemnation pursues them, from that which called
them, which they being unfaithful unto, it ministers not consolation but
condemnation, it speaks not peace but war, etc.

And this being always present with them to put them in mind of their neglect,
of their unfaithfulness, of their disobedience, and of their unworthiness,
they are always disquieted and tosticated in themselves, and in such, the
murmurer and unbeliever has place, and such are very unfitting to bear
crosses, trials and sufferings, for all these will add to the trouble, which
they were before possessed withal, so that very many inconveniences do ensue,
where the end for which God called a people is not answered by them that are
called; therefore, my dearly beloved friends, be mindeful not only of the end,
for which you are called, but of answering the same, that the Lords delight may
be to do good unto you; who are his peculiar treasure, and live all in his
eternal power and spirit, that you may know the Lord and his eternal truth to
be on your sides, when furious men rise up against you, then need you not be
afraid, of what they can do unto you, for has not the Lord oftentimes already
suffered many of you to be tried, through the fury of the wicked, which at
sundry times has been high against you, but how has the Lord turned it
backward, and how has he restrained the wickedness of the wicked by his
mighty power from being executed upon you: even to your own admiration, and
has not the Lords end in this been to engage you through his infinite mercy,
so much the more unto him, who oftentimes suffered the fury of the ungodly to
break forth a little, yet not for the destroying, but for the trying his
people, and how near have we found him unto us, even as a rock of defense to
fly unto in our greatest straites; difficulties, and temptations, and what free
access have we had unto him, through his eternal spirit in our selves, when by
Jayles, houses of correction, force of Arms and the like, we have been hindered
from having access one unto another, or for meeting together in the outward,
yet by those things before mentioned, we could not be hindered from meeting
together in the Lord, I mean in the eternal spirit, when the fury of the wicked
has been as the rageing of the Sea, and having then the testimony of the Lords
eternal Spirit in our selves, that we had answered the Lords end in his calling
of us, in that we had faithfully shown forth his praise, and brought honor and
renown unto his Name upon earth, Oh! what joy and peace, that, did bring unto
our souls, and how did we rejoice in the Lord when he covevered our heads, as
in the day of battle, even until that the fury of the wicked came to be
abated so oftentimes [you know] have we seen the eminent hand of our God
stretched out for our deliverance, which has hitherto preserved us to our
great admiration, therefore, let us who have had such experience of the
faithfulness of our God endeavor to be like unto him, even faithful as he is
faithful.

And now forasmuch as that in these perilous times, we cannot well serve our
God in that way, in which he required us to walk, without being in jeopardy of
bonds and imprisonments: or to have other sufferings imposed upon us, by reason
of our meeting together to wait upon the Lord, and it does therefore so much
the more concern us to feel the drawings of our God by his eternal Spirit to
our meetings; that when we are met we may so much the more enjoy his presence
in our meetings, to the refreshment of our souls, and then if we suffer for
waiting upon him, he will not leave us comfortless in that suffering, which
for that cause comes upon us: [and this is the word of truth unto you] neither
will it be grievous to us, while we keep in that through which we enjoyed him
in our meeting, for in that may we enjoy him in our sufferings: and then it
will be better to be one day in a prison with the Lord, then a thousand else
where, without the enjoyment of his presence, in which we have found, (as you
know) much joy and peace, much comsort and consolation, and therefore have we
cause to hazard our liberty, through our keeping of our meeting, though we be
accounted by men offenders for so doing, rather then through the neglecting of
them, we should become offenders in the light of the Lord, through whose mercy
we are come to know the benefit of them, to the end we might prise and frequent
them, and not slight nor neglect them, for it is certain if we neglect them, we
shall not reap any benefit by them, but if we frequent them, according to the
manner of the faithful, then will the Lord be with us at them: and amongst us
in them, and then his end in bringing of us into the practice of such meetings,
will be answered to his glory and our comforts.

Again as concerning swearing, what was the Lords end in giving us to see the
evil of this? was it not that we should keep clear of it, and bear our faithful
testimony against it, as against a hurtful evil, which is direct contrary to
the doctrine of Christ, and seeing we have known the terrors of the Lord God
against this evil, and have therefore persuaded others from it, how can we
therefore in any wise consent unto it, as to do it, though we should therefore
lose both our liberties and estates, for surely the Lord has an end in
convincing us of it, and in showing us the evil of it, and if we keep clear of
it, and bear a faithful testimony against it unto the end, then the Lords end
in convincing us of the evil of it, will be -- Answered; who knew before what
would come upon us, by reason of our testimony against it. And if God had not
suffered this as a snare in the hand of our enemies, there would have been
something else, (as there are besides things many) which they take up as
occasions against us, as covers for their wickedness, and these things are not
without the Lords permission, who will try his Jewels as Gold that is seven
times purified, and the more that we keep our Consciences void of off^nce
toward him and man, the more precious we shall be in his sight, but if we
should love our Liberties, our Estates or Lives more then him who has said,
Swear not at all, and for the saving of these should swear, conttary to his
command, we should not only neglect answering his end in forbidding of it, but
incur his displeasure against us, and while through doing that which he
forbids, we may think to save our Liberties, estates, and lives, we might even
in a moment loose them all, for we know they are uncertain, therefore let us
answer the Lords end in showing us the evil of this also, and in being faithful
in this, and in all other things, we shall find life, riches, and liberties,
which the world can neither give us, nor take from us. Moreover Friends, as
concerning your Return again to the Steeple Houses, and unto which some would
force you at this day, but alas, shall not he that sits in the Heavens laugh
at their folly? for does not the least amongst you know that was not the Lords
end in bringing you out of them; (I mean, that you should return to them again)
neither needed you have suffered upon this account by that generation that
continues in them, if God had not determined to have tried you out of them, and
that by the suffering which comes, and will come upon you, for not repairing to
them; yet nevertheless if you would rather answer the Adversaries will by your
returning to them again, then the Lords end in calling you out of them, then
you might suddenly free your selves from suffering upon this account; but I
doubt not out you are otherwise minded, yea, resolved to answer the Lords end
in his calling you out of them, notwithstanding your Adversa^^^s present
threatenings, forcing and compellings, which is not of, from, by, nor through
the Spirit of the Lord God, and therefore in the Spirit with patienec must you
bear what the Lord suffers to come upon you upon this count, for I testify
unto you it is not for the destroying of any, though it may tend to the proving
of many.

Wherefore my dear friends, let none be discouraged nor terrified at what the
Lord suffers to come upon you, by reason of your meetings, by reason of your
not swearing, by reason of your not going to their public worship, or by
reason of any other particular thing, as in relation to the truth of our God;
for while suffering comes upon you only by reason of the truth, you need not
be ashamed of it, neither will the Lord leave you comfortless in it, for he is
ready to succor such as for conscience sake suffer by reason of these things,
even as thousands, (who have found it by experience) can testify.

In the mean time comfort ye one another in the bowels of love, and be ye
tender affectionated one to another, and regard not the present threatenings of
men, nor look not at the present tribulations, but regard the truth in your
selves; and look unto the Lord, and hear what he says, and if he speak peace,
be not ye troubled, though men speak and prepare war against you, but hold ye
always fast the word of Gods power and patience, which is able to preserve and
keep you in all your sufferings and tribulations, even unto the day of
salvation, and unto this do I commit you all (my dearly beloved friends) as
unto that which is able to save you all to the utmost, so the peace and
blessing of the Almighty be with, upon, and among you all, for evermore.

I suppose many of you have heard of my bonds, how that after God of his mercy
had delivered me out of a mighty violent storm at Sea, I was cast in here,
where they in Authority have showed themselves to be worse to me, and the
friends with me, then the Barbarious people of Melita was to Paul, and them
that were with him; who showed them no small kindness, for they received and
lodged them courteously; but these that are called Christians showed themselves
to be barbarous rather then courteous, in that they broke up our Meeting with
many Soldiers, and afterward committed us to prison, and in stead of showing
us much kindness, they have been so cruel to us, as that sometime it was
difficult for us to get water and bread, and so were far from courteously
entertaining of us, or with honoring of us with many honors, as the
Barbarians did them before mentioned; howbeit, the Lord is with us, and their
cruelty has been little to us, for we know that our God will in his own due
time deliver us out of their hands, when our testimony is sufficiently born
amongst them, but of this I am very sensible, that with the baptism of
suffering under this spirit of persecution in the Nation, many are to be
baptized into the fellowship of the Gospel with the Saints in light, and
blessed and thrice happy are they, and will they be, that continue faithful
unto the end, for they shall be saved. Farewell in the Lord, in whom I remain,

Your dear friend and Brother WILLIAM CATON.
My fellow Prisoners salutes you all. This for Friends to be read in their
Meetings.



Yarmouth the 14. of the 11. Month, 1663.
DEar Friends, Brethren and Sisters, (who are called to follow the Lamb
wh^thersoever he goes) my very soul greeteth you all with the salutation of my
unfeigned and entire love in and through the eternal spirit which the God of
our strength and comfort has sent into our hearts, through which I am made to
share with you, not only of your sufferings, which you meet withal through
your following of the Lamb) but also of your consolation which you find in the
midst of your suffering; and truly my heart rejoices in this fellowship with
you, and my soul claims a part with you of all your sufferings and consolations
which you meet withal in this your return to Zion; and my heart is affected
with the dealings of the Lord with you, and with his infinite love and mercy
unto you, and often does my spirit intercede unto him with strong sighs and
groans, (which cannot easily be uttered) on your behalf, whom he loves, though
the world hate you, whom he has respect unto, though the world despise you,
whom he cares for though the world trample upon you, whom he has brought into
fellowship with himself, and with his Saints in light, though the world
excommunicate you, wherefore then should any of you be afraid of their
threatenings, or regard their excommunications, which in my heart I have
considered of, and pondred upon.

And this I have seen in the light of the Lord, that they that cannot bring
people from under the power of Satan, they cannot give up them unto Satan, who
through the power of God are brought (as you are) from under Satan's power. 2ly.
I have seen that the curses of them that pretend to excommunicate you, are but
like the curses of Shemi, that cursed David; or the curses of of profane
Publicans, who when they are troubled at you will curse you for the good
counsel you give them, when you exhort them to the fear the Lord, and to
forsake the evil of their ways. 3ly. I cannot see that they can excommunicate
you out of that which many of you never were in, (I mean, their Church, or its
fellowship) but suppose you had been in it, what evil can they lay to your
charge, by reason of which they should deliver you unto Satan; of which they
not being able to convince you, ought not therefore (according to that which
they profess to be the^^ Rule) excommunicate any of you. 4ly. They should
first make proof of their Ministry, through bringing people thereby from under
Satan's power, and by bringing you first into fellowship, before they had gone
about to have excommunicated you out of that, which many of you never have been
in. And though at first they may pretend love unto your souls, but ho^ do they
manifest it, seeing when you refuse to come at their call, they presently
(after their manner) will deliver you over unto Satan, is this then love? let
the wise in heart judge.

But methinks I have seen them, as men in an old decayed ruined ship at sea,
that was ready to perish, who cried to some that were in a safe harbor to come
to their ship for safety, and pretended much love unto them, but they in the
harbor being wise, would not come into their rotten ship for many good
reasons, whereupon they in the ship grew angry, and pretending to force them
into the ship, but did presently throw them into the sea, before ever they got
them into the ship; thus their treachery appeared, who pretended love, but were
filled with envy. Is it not thus with them that go about to draw you from
your safe harbor, (at which many of you through mercy are arrived) who while
they pretend they would force you out of love to your souls into their Church
fellowship, do in their haste before they get you so far, deliver you (so
much as in them lies) unto Satan: oh! who would therefore put confidence in
such men, for surely they are of them who rather seeks yours then you, and had
rather share your Estates then have your society; therefore, well said the
Apostle, Turn away from such; and in the same spirit (according to my measure)
say I, Turn not again unto such, least while you turn unto them, you turn from
following the Lamb, and come then through the Lambs power to be excommunicated
out of the fellowship with the Saints in light, and come thereby to be
delivered unto Satan, which God forbid.

And Friends, however of this I am assured, and can assure you, that by all
their power, whether Ecclesiastical or Civil, they shall not be able to
excommunicate you, out of that Church which is in God, nor out of the
fellowship of the Saints in light; neither shall they by their power whether
Ecclesiastical or Civil, deprive you of your peace and comfort in the Lord,
while you abide faithful. Let this therefore be your comfort in the height of
your sufferings, when they cast you out of their Synagogues, and say, Let the
Lord be glorified; and when they spoil your goods, and cast your bodies into
prison, and say they will make you examples, that others may fear, oh be not ye
troubled at any of these things, for the Lamb whom ye follow will not leave you
comfortless, for if, you be in prison he will be with you, if you suffer
hunger he will feed you, if you suffer the spoiling of your goods for the
testimony of his eternal truth, he is heir of all things, and he has all power
in his hand, who cloatheth the Lyllies, and feeds the Ravens, and what will
he not provide for you his followers, that make war in righteousness through
faith under his banner of love? yea, yea, (my beloved friends) he will reward
you into your own bosoms, though for the present you suffer such buffetting
and beating, such imprisonment, and spoiling of your goods, and such cruel
usage in many respects, and he will not suffer the rod of the wicked to rest
always upon your lot. Therefore, be of good cheer in the midst of these your
sufferings which now you are to follow the Lamb through, who through sufferings
was made perfect, and now sits at the right hand of his father in the highest
heavens, where they that now suffer upon earth for his names sake, shall reign
with him in glory and immortality for ever and ever.

Wherefore, comfort ye one another with these things in the midst of these your
present sufferings, which are not worthy to be compared to the glory which
shall be revealed, when the Lamb and such as now follow him through suffering
shall have the victory, with which God of his infinite mercy crown you all (my
dear Brethren and Sisters) and bless you all with all spiritual blessings in
heavenly places in the son of his love, the Captain of our salvation, to whose
safe custody and protection I commit you all, and remain,

Your dear Brother and Companion in tribulation, and yet in bonds for the
testimony of Jesus, WILLIAM CATON.

Another EPISTLE, To Friends.
DEar Brethren and Sisters in the Lord Jesus Christ, I salute you in the
bowels of tender love; Dear Friends, all keep low in the life, that the living
virtue you all may feel to nourish the tender Babe of God, and all be tender
over the principle of God in your own particulars, and that will lead you to be
tender over one another, and all keep in the pure wisdom of God, and watch one
over another with a single eye, and you that are strong bear the weak, and come
into oneness, oneness of mind, for there the blessing is; so dear hearts, I
am filled with the streams of Gods eternal love, and my streams of love flows
toward you all: So friends, sink down into the life and power of God, that you
may be preserved pure and clean, that nothing may arise which would break your
peace with God, that you may be preserved in unity with him, and one with
another, that pure love may spring up one to another, in which love you will be
all refreshed, and be as a watered Garden, feeling the well within, from whence
the living streams flows forth, and this keeps all broken and tender; so all
that which is hard, rough, untoward, or pievish, is kept out; yea, all that
which would make a rent, is seen, and comprehended, and with the light of Jesus
Christ judged, and you by the word of power reconciled unto God, and one to
another: and let your meeting be in that, so will you all feel the presence of
the living God amongst you, and there are we knit together in one, and in that
am I with you, and near you all, and feel you who are in the life and power of
truth, where the presence of the Lord is felt, where we reign and trample upon
all that which would lead from the truth. So dear friends, keep within, and
stay your minds in the light of Christ, that you may grow up in the soundness,
to be of a sound mind, not soon shaken, but seek the rock Christ to stand upon;
dwell in that which changes not, that in the oneness you may be kept, for the
Light of Christ changes not; to all that which is in the changing is not of
Christ, who changes not: And to that measure of life I commit you all, which
at first convinced you, which begot love and tenderness in you toward God and
toward one another: Ah friends, in that keep, so shall you feel peace.
