HIS MAJESTY'S Passing through the Scots Army.
General Lasley being advertised of the time of his Majesty's coming to
New Castle, that he might as well appear in his own art and luster as in his
duty and loialty to his Sovereign (having first made his choice of fit
ground) he drew out his whole forces both horse and foot with the Artillery
and the better to express the soldiers salute and welcome of their King, he
rallied his men into two divisions of equal number ranging them in a great
length with an equal distance between them of about eight score which rendered
them the more conspicuous and with the braver aspect to the beholders, through
these the King was to pass, whither being come the General aligh^ing from his
horse (which was presently taken by two of his footmen) He prostrated himself
and service before the King upon his knees, his Majesty a while privately
talking to him and at his rising gave him his hand to kiss, and commanded his
horse to be given him, whereon remounted, he ridd with the King through the
Army.

In the first place stood H^ghlanders commonly called Redshankes, with their
plains cast over their shoulders having every one his bow and arrows with a
broad slycing sword by his side, these are so good markes-men that they will
kill a dear in his speed, it being the chiefest part of their living, selling
the skinns by great quantities and feeding on the flesh, next were Musketeers
interlac't with Pikes and here and there intermixed with those dangerous short
gunnes invented by that their famous engineer Sandy Hamilton and were for the
sudden execution of horse in case they should assail them, then again bows
muskets and pikes for a good distance on both sides, in the midway the
Artillery was placed by Tiers consisting of about 60. pieces of Ordnance, the
cannoniers standing in readiness with fired linstockes in their hands, the
horsemen were here placed on both sides which served as wings or flanks for the
whole Army and so forward in the same order, but disposed into so goodly a
presence and posture, with such suitable equipage and millitarie accommodations
that they appeared ready to give or take battle, or Forth with to have gone
upon some notable design. And as the King passed a long they gave such true
fire as it is believed since the invention of gunnes never better was seen or
heard, they discharged wondrous swift but with as good a method and order as
your skilfullest Ringers observe with Bells, not suffering the noise of the one
to drown the other, the King received such contentment that whereas his dinner
was appointed and provided at the Majors of New Castle, he yet went and
honored General Lasley with his presence at dinner, who has not only gained
a good report with his Maje^^ie to be a brave Soldier but also a singular
esteem to be a most expert and able commander and general by such ofour
English Officers as were then with his Majesty

THE Manner of the Scots departure, and marching out of New Castle.
THe Scots when they marched out of Newcastle their Artillery being mounted
upon their carriages, advanced first forth with the Cannoniers and other
Officers thereto belonging and some troops of horse, then most of the Regiments
of foot, after them their provision baggage and carriage, then followed the
rest of the foot, and all the rest taking their leaves in a most brotherly and
friendly manner, being gone some four miles from the Town their general
having directed them to march forwards he returned to Newcastle accompanied
with some few of his officers, causing the Toll Bell to be rung up and down
the Town proclaming that if any of the Town were not yet satisfied for any
thing due to them from any of his Officers or soldiers, let them bring in
their Tickets and he would pay them, which he did accordingly to the great
content of the Townes-men, and much applause of the General and his whole
Army, and after a solemn taking of his leave he followed the Army going all
the way along with them in the Reere as they marched and not any thing taken
from any man in all their Journey to their singular Commendation and gayning
the good esteem of all that passed by.

FINIS.
