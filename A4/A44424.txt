THE SWORD-MAN's Vade Mecum: Or, A PRESERVATIVE Against the SURPRISE OF A
Sudden Attack with Sharps.

BEING A Reduction of the most Essential, Necessary and Practical Part of
Fencing, into a few special Rules, with their Reasons, which all Swordmen
should have in their Memories when they are to engage, but more especially if
it be with Sharps.

As also, Some other Remarks and Observations not unfit to be known by Fencing
Masters and Others.

TO ALL TRUE ARTISTS, OR Such who have a Real Respect for, and take Delight in
the ART of FENCING.
GENTLEMEN,
WHEN I Wrote my Book of Fencing, Entitled The SCOTS Fencing-Master, I
designed it should serve both to instruct the Ignorant, and be a help to
Artists; to instruct the Ignorant by giving them a true and particular
Description of the most common Lessons taught in the Fencing Schools, that so
by it they might come to understand both better and sooner, the Lessons which
their Masters were daily to Descrive and Teach them; And I am very confident I
have not failed as to that, for I dare appeal to any who ever took the pains to
peruse it, if ever they met with a piece upon the same subject, either so
plain, or exact in the Directions for the Lessons, as it is.

I designed also it should be a help to Artists, in so far as that the looking
it over, would bring to their minds such Lessons, as want of Practice for some
time might have worn out of their Memories, and also in respect that there is
in it very good directions and Rules for their behavior in practice against
either Artists or Ignorants, both with Blunts and Sharps.

But in that Book I gave only a bare Discriptio^ of the Rules, without any of
the Reasons subjoyne^ to them upon which they were grounded, which ommission
did probably make some Artists judge, tha^ those Rules were not so very
infallible, but that as good might be put in their places; And which it is like
has also been the cause of their not having so good an Opinion of, and liking
for them, as perhaps otherwise they would.

Therefore, that I might both vindicate the certainty and infallibility of my
Rules, by showing that they are not grounded merely upon my own Fancy, but upon
the solid Foundations of Art and Reason, and satisfy such persons by
publishing the Reasons upon which I ground them; As also, make my Rules more
compendious, and easier to be kept in their memories, I have in these following
sheets made an Abstract of them, and have given the Reasons, why I order such
and such a thing in such a Rule.

And although I cannot deny, but a judicious Artist may perhaps make use of
some Rules of his own choice, or making, differing somewhat from mine, which
may be very good, and have sometimes as good effect against the particular Play
of the Persons he is to engage against as mine could have; Yet I am confident
^hey can be no better than mine are, and that if he ^bserved mine exactly
against that same Person, he would find them to have the very same effects with
his own, and to be against all humors whatsoever generally the more secure and
certain of the two.

But albeit I confess there may be particular Rules invented for particular
humors of Play, which may differ from mine, and yet prove very effectual
against that particular humor for which they were designed; yet against one of
another humor they will be altogether Ineffectual and prove stark naught, in
which does consist their insufficiency, whereas those which I am to give you
will not only prove as effectual against those particular humors, as the
particuar Rules designed for them, but will be sufficient also against all
humors whatsoever, so that there will be no need of particular Ones, mine
supplying their place because they are general, in which does lie their Worth
and Excellency.

For to discover to you the unsufficiency of particular Rules, consider but
what difference there is betwixt a Man's playing with a Person whose humor and
method of playing he knows, and with one whom perhaps he never so much as saw
before, certainly there must be Methods taken vastly dissierent to play
Advantagiously against either of those Persons as a Man shall be engaged; for
if he be Attaqued by a Person whose Play he knows, then knowing upon what
Lessons his humor runs; I confess be may safely make use of particular
Contrarys, and Pursuits which he knows will take effect upon his Adversary,
(although undoubtedly to use generals were a great dale more safe) but if he
be Attaqued by one whom perhaps he never saw, or if he did, yet knows not
upon what Lessons his humor runs: I say in such a Case to make use of
Particulars were but very bad Judgment.

As for Example, to make a Real and Home Pursuit with a single or double
Feint, when no such pursuit will take effect upon that Person again whom he is
playing, but what is accompanied with binding; or to take himself to any
particular Parrade, when he is not certain what Lesson his Adversary is to play
home upon him; this I say is but to play at Random, and wholly expose himself
to Contretemps, by rendering his Art altogether Ineffectual.

And this bad Custom of using alwise Particulars, is certainly one of the main
Reasons, why the French (who are generally of a Brisk and Hot Constitution) are
for the most part when they Engage either both Killed, or at least severly
wounded, because immediately after presenting, they commonly Advance with the
particular Pursuit of some single or double Feint, without ever offering to
secure their Adversarie's Sword, and their Adversary upon the other Hand, not
being accustomed to a general Parrade, and finding he is not certain what
particular one he should make use of, endeavors to take time upon him, and so
they are both wounded: This is the True French Play, whieh I confess has a
Bonne grace with it at Blunts, and appears Brisk and Courageous at Sharps; but
as to its security, I leave that to be judged of by any considering Person,
whither Artist or other.

Therefore the only secure way is to make alwise use of Generals against
whatever Persons you Play, whither Artists or not, until you have found out
their Constitution and Humor, and what particular Lessons you judge will take
effect upon them, and if you think it fit and convenient then to try
Particulars, you may, but I would not advise you to do it sooner if you regard
your own safety.

You may now perceive the great Advantage General Rules have of Particular
ones, and it is the Abstract of those General Rules that are of such admirable
use, which I am to set down to you together with their Reasons in the following
sheets, but that there may want nothing to make them complete and easy to be
retained; I have also for your greater ease and satisfaction, (at the end of my
Rules and before I give my Reasons) Epitomized this Abstract, and brought it
into so narrow a Compass, that a Man must have no memory at all, if he cannot
so fix in his Fancy and Brain what I have there given him, as it shall not be
in his power when he presents either Fleuret or Sword to get himself ridd of
it.

And it is upon that account I call it The SWORD-MAN's Vade Mecum, not that I
would have alwise these Sheets carried about with him in his Pocket; (for that
any Ignorant can do as well as he, and be never a whitt the wiser of them) but
that the Epitome of my Rules which as I said is at the end of them, may be so
engraven in his Memory, that when he is any ways to Engage, he may through it
practice all the rest which are as it were lively represented in that Mirror,
which must be alwise carried about with him, and still represent those Objects
(I mean Directions) upon which his Judgment must work.

Now, as my former Book of Fencing was designed for the use both of Artists and
Ignorants, so this Abstract is only for Artists, there being only contained in
it the very Marrow and Quintessence of Fencing, which without all debate is not
only above the Practice of all, but capacity of most part of Ignorants until it
be explained to them, and therefore they can have no pretense or claim of
Right to it; but if such Persons will be so courious as to take a look of it,
its like they may find some things (in my Observations especially) which may be
a means to reclaim them, and make them sensible of their Ignorance and folly
in contemning and neglecting an Art, by which a Man does reap so many
undeniable Advantages.

And if the reading of this do it not; I assure them I shall not put my self to
to the trouble so much as to think of doing it any other way, having lost all
hopes that any thing will succed if this once fail; for to deal Ingenously, I
am resolved never to put Pen more to Paper upon this Subject, seeing I think
what I have said first and last upon it, not only abundantly sufficient to
Instruct those, whose gentile Inclinations do dispose them to take delight in,
and follow this Useful Art; but also to convince and persuade all who have the
least Drop of generous Blood, of the worth and excellency of it.

But leaving such Persons to follow their foolish Inincliations, I do really
acknowledge, that it is only to such generous Spirits as you are (to whom I
have Addressed these following Sheets) that I so earnestly recomend the closs
Practice and Observance of their subsequent Rules, in the Rejecting or
Approbation of which, I shall wholly submit my self to your Impartial Cencure;
earnestly Entreating, that if there shall be found any thing in them Repugnant
to the first Principles and true Fundamentals of Art, I may be acquainted with
it, that so I may either Vindicate my self, or acknowledge my Fault and Error;
in both which I shall most willingly endeavor to satisfy all True Lovers of
Art.

And I assure you, were it not that I am Ambitious, this Art (for which I have
such an Estime my self, and of which I think I have given sufficient
Testimonies) should be both improven and be hereafter had in more Repute
amongst the generality of our Gentry then it has been hitherto, I had never
been either at the Trouble or Charges, to expose my self a second time to the
sensure of the Public, by giving you this (I may call it my Masterpiece upon
this Subject) in Print.

I thought to have had the Approbation of most of the Masters prefixed to this
Piece; but there being some things in my Observations (especially anent the
Abuses committed in Fencing-Schools to which I refer you) in which we differ,
and which they would not go along with, I have therefore only condescended to
Print the Approbation of one who is of the same Opinion with my self, which I
hope will not be thought any Vanity in me, seeing I am most sensible the
Applause and Commendation he is pleased to bestow upon me, is far above what I
really deserve.

ADIEU.
A LETTER OF APPROBATION, BY WILLIAM MACHRIE FENCING-MASTER, Judge and
Arbitrator of all who make any public Trial of Skill in the Noble Art of the
SWORD, within the Kindom of SCOTLAND.
Right Honorable,
I Received your Papers, and have perused them so narrowly, that there is not
one Paragraph or Line that has escaped my strictest Observation; wherein, I
find nothing but Plain, Undeniable, and Inerrable Truths: And (without
Complement) beyond any thing that ever I have Read on that Subject; all other
Authors being so Abstruse and Intricate, that those who have acquired a
considerable knowledge of the Sword, cannot reach the understanding of their
Writtings; so that in my Opinion, who ever may claim the Honor of being the
first Author of the Noble Art of Defense, I am confident there is none who
reads what you have Writ on that Subject; but will readily Eesteem you one of
the most considerable Advancers of it, that any Age or Country has yet
produced.

The Rules of Practice which you have so Clearly and Orderly set down in your
SCOTS Fencing Master, shows you to be a great Master of the Art; and your
reducing all these to so small a number, together with the solid Reasons and
Demonstrations you have given of them in your SWORD MAN'S Vade mecum, evidences
you to be also in the Judgment of the Sword, a Master of all ARTISTS.

Certainly the Sword was never so much Addepted to the Pen before, as it is now
by that late Piece of yours, wherein you have done this considerable Honor to
the Art, that as formerly (for want of Reasons and Demonstrations of its Rules)
it was scarce accounted an Art, and but a Mechanical one at best; Now its
Fundamental Rules being digested into good order, founded on firm Reasons, and
fortified by solid Demonstrations, it may justly claim all the privileges,
that any of the Liberal or Mathematical Arts can pretend to.

Proceed then (Worthy Sir) in your Laudable Design of improving the Noble Art
of the Sword, which methinks does only wait, and hope to receive 'its outmost
Accomplishment, from the Pen and Hands of Sir WILLIAM HOPE. For your pains
herein will Infallibly meet with the just Requitable of Praise, Honor and
Esteem, from all true Lovers of Arms and Arts; together also with all
Imaginable thanks, especially from Swordmen; whom you cannot either Honor or
Oblidge more, then by publishing that Piece; which merits more Applause and
Commendation, then can ever be given it, by

RIGHT HONORABLE, Your Honors most Humble and Obedient Servant, William
Machrie.
Aberdeen, April, 30. 1690.
THE SWORD-MANS VADE MECUM, OR, A Preservative against the Surprise, of a
Sudden Attaque with Sharps, etc.
BEING to Direct my Discourse to Persons so knowing and Skilful as You are to
whom I have Addressed these Sheets; I think I need but say little (by way of
Introduction) in Commendation of this ART, either to Display its Excellencies,
or Recommend it to You; the very Tittle of my Dedication supposing you to need
neither of these, to excite You to its Practice.

I shall therefore at present only say, that the Generous and Noble Art of
Defense (passing by all its other Qualities) may in some Respect be compared to
the most Excellent and most Sublime of all Sciencies, I mean that of Divinity;
For as Divinity does teach us, to defend our Souls from the cruel assaults and
attempts of that old Serpent the Devil, the cunning and subtle alurements of
the World, and these pleasant and short but destroving lusts of the flesh.

So does the Art of Fencing teach us to defend our Bodies, from the Assaults
and Attaques of all Adversaries, whether Artists or not, who in respect of the
cruel design they have against our Bodies, may in some sense be accounted
Devils, it also teaches us not to be deceived by the fallacious Quirks and
Tricks of Artists when we are engaged with them, which do represent the cunning
and subtle Allurements of the World.

And lastly, it furnishes us with directions to defend our selves from the
Thrusts and Wounds of our Adversaries, which although they can be said to be
pleasant to none but the Giver, yet are short and destroying to the Receiver,
short and transitory, because they are swift and given in the twinkling of an
eye, or a moment; and destroying, because they seldom fail to dissipate and
give a Passage to our Vital Spirits; by which we are sent a packing to our long
Home: And therefore they may be justly compared because of their danger and
short continuance) to the pleasures of the World; and the Comparison comes yet
nearer, In so far as they reach not only the Body, but ofttimes also endanger
the Soul.

Seeing then there is such an Annallogie betwixt this Humane Art and that Divine
Science, what kind of Persons must those be who ^ndervallow it? -- But when I
reflect a little, find it no great surprizal that Fencing should ^eet with so
many Opposers and Contemners when even Divinity yea GOD Himself (to speak with
Reverence) is by some treated En Ridicule, and I am apt to believe that the
dispising and contempt of both, (although ^here be no equality in the
Comparison) may flow from the same Original and Source.

For as it is impossible for any Man who considers the Fabric of the whole,
nay; but the ^mallest and most inconsiderable part of the Universe, to doubt of
a first or supreme Being, until from the consciousness of his Sins and
Provocations, it become his Interest there should be none; so is it Impossible
for any Man who reflects upon, and considers the excellencies of Fencing, to
doubt or question the usefulness of it; until from a sense of his own
Ignorance, and of the Advantadges he knows Artists will have over him; it does
become his Interest, that there should be no such thing as Art, or at least
that what is called Art should be of no use: And this is certainly one of the
chief Reasons, why the Art of the Sword is ^o much undervalued, by those who
understand it not.

But that I may the better represent such Persons to you: consider in what a
Pitiful and Deplorable condition they are, when (after having received a
challenge, or being obliged to Fight in Rancounter) they seriously reflect upon
the Art, and Androitness of their Antagonists, and their own Maladroitness, and
Ignorance, by which they are rendered incapable of either knowing what way to
begin their Pursuit, or defend themselves; certainly their thoughts at that
time must either abaite and cool their Courage, or make them altogether
desperate.

And indeed, to see the most part of them when they are engaged for their
Lives, one would judge them to be by their Pursuits, rather out of their Wits,
and Madd-men, then Sober and Rational Persons; and they are necessitate to
force themselves unto that Fury and Passion, that so their frowardness may
somewhat supply their Ignorance; for if they declined to Fight, it would loss
them their Reputation and Honor; Therefore to save that they must Fight, and
in Fighting it is odds but they loss their Life, which to preserve they use all
the most unseemly and desperate Actions in the World; all which will not do
against complete Artists such as you are.

And if it be asked why Ignorants (for I expect they will not take it ill I
give them this Disignation, seeing it is not done out of any Contempt to their
Persons, or reflection upon their Judgments which may be very deserv^g in
other things, but merely because it is ^e custom amongst Swordmen, to let all
who ^derstand not the Art of the Sword go under that Name) are generally more
Subject (...) Passion and Forewardness in their Pursuit ^an Artists.

It is Answered, That in some Extremes ^ere is a Coincidence, and that Art and
Igno^nce may sometimes act alike, as in the in^ance of Fear and Courage, for as
Desperation which is the height of Fear, does many times ^eing sharpened by
Necessity) excite Courage, ^d beget Hope; so Temerity which is the ^ight of
Courage, does often (from experience of Danger) breed Caution, which is a ^cret
Fear;

Now to make the application, Ignorance ^om a sense it has of the Hazard and
Dan^er it may receive from Art, begets Fear or ^spair, and being sharpened up by
this Des^ir which is as it were a leaven to make it ^ment, it is forced and
hoaved up (although ^trary to its Nature) to Courage and Forewardness which I
may properly enough call, Temeritatis vel Ignorantiae audacia, and which should
be never esteemed nor made use of, ex^pt in a great Extreme or Necessity,
because (...) has its arise from Ignorance, which is the ground and cause of
its being so frequently put in practice by those who have little or no Art and
this I take to be the Reason of Ignorant having generally so hot and violent a
Pursuit

So by this you may perceive how Ignorant may prompt a Man to be Forward and
Ventorious as well as Art: now as Ignorance (which (...) Diametrically opposite
to Art, and which should in reason produce nothing but Fear and Concern) does
excite Courage, so does Art, which in reason should be Prolifick of nothing bu^
Courage and Heroic Actions, breed some times Caution, which may be very well
calle^ a discreet and reasonable Fear, or rather Pertiae and experientiae
Cautela, and which is only esteemed and put in practice by Judicious an^
Understanding Artists, because it proceed from the experience which Art gives
then of the danger they would run in making a violent and inconsiderate
Pursuit, which is n^ carried on with Judgment, and performed by Art; and this
is the Reason why Artist are generally not so foreward and irregular i^ their
Pursutes as Ignorants, but more caution and slow, and consequently more certain
an^ safe.

Is it not therefore (from what I have bee^ saying) far more commendable, to be
dexterous and regular in our Offensive and Defensive motions, then irregular,
and as it were out of a^ Hope, and in Depair, that if we overcome, we may be
said to have done it by Art and Judgment, and not at random, and by chance,
more beseeming an irrational than a rational Creature.

If it be, what Art can teach us better, than this of Fencing? I confess I need
not recommend it to you, whose Inclinations have already led you that way, but
perhaps it may not prove an unseasonable Advice to others who may peruse this
and the foregoing Dedication.

I shall therefore say no more in Commendation of this Noble and Gentlemany
Art, but shall before I proceed, show you the Method I intend to follow in
Communicating and Discovering the Reasons upon which it is grounded, and the
Source from whence all its Worth and Security does flow; and for the more
regular Procedure shall first give you the single Rules, one after another,
which you are always to have in your Memory; Then secondly each particular
Rule by it self, with the Reasons subjoyned to it upon which it is grounded;
And thirdly, some Remarkes and Observations, all which will be both Useful, and
if I mistake it not, pleasant to the Reader.

First, The RVLES.
BEfore I begin, I shall give you a Fundamental, which in respect of its
Excellency, and Universality, I may call the Golden Number, or Rule of Three,
both because it is always to be taken along with you, and to be made a part,
(and that none of the least) of each Particular Rule I am to give you, and also
because it consists of Three important Terms or Words, which are.

Calmness, -- Vigor, -- and Judgment

Now these three Words in general, being the only Foundation upon which all
Tru^ Fencing is built, and each Word in particula^ being as it were a Column,
or Pillar by which my Rules are to be supported, (for without them all would be
but Uncertain and False I shall begin my First Rule, which as well as all the
rest, is to be supported by those three in fallible, and never to be too
exactly copie^ Pillars of the composite Order, because each of them in some
measure partake of the Beauty and Excellency of the other two, and to that end
Earnestly and Seriously entreats and desires: That.

RULE I.
Whatever you do, let it always (if possible) be done Calmely, and without
Passion, and Precipitation, bu^ still with all Vigor, and Briskness imaginable
your Judgment not failing to Direct, Order, an^ Govern you as to both.

RULE II.
With Calmness, Vigor, and Judgment, put your self into as Closs, Thinn, and
Convenient a Guard, as the Agility of your Body will permit, your Heels being
still kept as near other as possible.

RULE III.
With Calmness, Vigor, and Judgment, make use (for your Defense) of the most
Excellent, and not to be parrallelled Contre-caveating Parrade, and that
generally upon the outside of your Sword, your left hand always asisting you
if any ways doubtful of the Parrade; and that you may with the more certainty
defend your self, look always to your Adversary's Sword-Hand.

RULE IIII.
With Calmness, Vigor, and Judgment, endeavor to Offend your Adversary, by
binding or securing his Sword, and that for the most part also upon the
outside, giving in a single plain Thrust upon the back of it, or if you please
make a Feint upon the back of your Binding, your left Hand making always a
kind of Parrade, at the giving in of every Thrust, the better to save you from
a Contre-temps; and by no means rest upon your Thrust, but instantly after the
performing of it, whether you ^itt or not, recover to your Defensive Posture
again: This is the true Play for a Man's Life: but if you be so far Master of
your Adversary, and so merciful to him that you design not his Life, but only
to disable him: Then.

RULE V.
With Calmness, Vigor, and Judgment, Thrust at his Sword-hand, Wrest, or Arm,
or at his nearest advanced Thigh, the wounding any of which once, or twice,
will seldom fail to disable him.

RULE VI.
If your Adversary be Hasty, Passionate, and pursue Furiously, and Irregulaty,
then with Calmness, Vigor, and Judgment, Cross, Stop, and Oppose his Fury:
but upon the contrary if Careless, Lash, Slow, or perhaps Timorous, then also
Calmly, Vigorously, and with Judgment pursue him.

RULE VII.
With Calmness, Vigor, and Judgment, prevent your Receiving one Thrust for
the giving another, called (after that dangerous Word, and Artists Bug bear) a
Contre-temps, and for that end the using your left Hand for a Defense upon your
Pursuit, as I have before told you, will not be found amiss.

RULE VIII.
Now to put a Close to my Rules, let them all be done within distance as much
as possible, and with little or no Elonge, or stretch of any part of the Body,
save only that of the Wrest and Arm (called a Spring) and as I desired you to
begin, so I expect you will continue and end all your Actions, with that most
Excellent Fundamental, and Golden Rule of Three, to wit.

Calmness, -- Vigor, -- and Judgment.

And then no doubt, you will procure by the foregoing Rules, advantage
proportionable to the Art you have acquired to put them in practice.

But that my Reduction may yet better answer my Design, (which was to be short
and compendious) and be more easily kept in your Memory, I have brought it into
a narrower Compass, by, as it were Epitomizing it as follows.

With Calmness Vigor, and Judgment
Use A Closs Guard. The Contre-caveating-Parrade. Binding.
Prevent A Contretemps. Being without Distance. Resting upon a Thrust.

A Man must be certainly void both of Art and Memory, if upon all necessary
Occasions he cannot furnish himself, with such an Excellent Preservative as
this; but seeing the very doubting of it, would be so absurd, and discover so
much a Man's Ignorance and weakness, I shall say no more, but (desiring to leave
it as it were Engraven in your Memory) procee^ to the second thing I proposed,
which was.

Secondly.
Each particular Rule, with the Reason subjoined to it, upon which it is
Grounded.

RULE I.
Whatever you do, let it always (if possible,) b^ done Calmely, and without
Passion, and Preci^^pitation: etc.
The Reasons upon which this Rule is grounded, are.

Because I find by Experience that Passion exposes a Man, and incapacitates
him, from making use of his Art with that Discretion which is required of him,
to procure the undeniable Advantage he has by it.

But that he may not by being advised to Play Calmly, fall into the other
Extreme of Playing too Carelessly, Lashly, and perhaps Timerously, (it being
difficult to determine which of these two Extremes, do most Eclipse a Man's Art,
and consequently most expose him to his Adversaries mercy^ he is advised to
counterfeit a kind of Passion, by playing Briskly, and Vigourously, it being as
it were a Medium, or if I may so call it a Balance or Counterpoise, which upon
the one Hand prevents his sinking in the Gulf of Unreasonable, and Unmanly
Fear, which would loss him his Reputation, and Honor, dearer to a Man than his
very Life, and upon the other his ascending the Ragged, Unequal, and Disperate
Rock of inconsiderate Passion and Forwardness, for which there is oftentimes
hardly any Retreat, or Des^ent, but by the Life of a Man's Adversary, if no his
own with it, both which should be preserved as much as possible, in respect,
not only of the great in it is against God Almighty (which to all Christians
should be a sufficient Reason) but also in respect of the severe punishments
the Laws both of God and Man, or^ain to be inflicted upon such as are guilty of
either: And for effectuating of which, if I be not deceived this first Rule
will not a little contri^ute, if it be practiced cautiously and as I have
ordered in the end of it, with Judgment, without which the best Rule I can
give or invent to you, will not signify a Straw, it being such a chief
Ingredient, that without it all the Compositions both for Defense and Offense,
in our Fencing Pharmacopie would signify but little or nothing, as I shall
more fully hereafter declare, when I speak to the Eight Rule.

RULE II.
With Calmness, Vigor, and Judgment, ^ut your self into as Gloss, Thinn, and
convenient a Guard, etc.
The Reasons upon which this Rule is Grounded, are.

Because it is most certain, that the closer a Man sink to the Ground, the more
secure he is from all the Thrusts which may be given in beneath his Sword at
the lower parts of his Body, which without all manner of doubt are both very
dangerous, and most difficult to Defend, because the Parrades of them lie not
so Naturally to a Man's Hand (supposing him to stand to a High Guard) as the
Parrades of the Thrust given in above, and that either without the Sword or
within it.

And the Reason is, because in the Defensiv^ part of the small Sword, all the
Parrades that are made beneath the Hand are a great dea^ stronger and firmer,
because they are, and ought to be done with a Jerk or Spring, whereas all the
Parrades of the Thrusts below the Sword, such as that of Feint a la test,
Voltcoupee, Flancanade, Under counter, etc. must be all (supposing him to stand
to a High Guard) parried Slopwayes, and your Adversaries Sword born off, and a
little up, as it were, by yours, which both hinders the Spring and weakeneth
the Parrade, by reason of the compelled Posture and Disposition of your Hand,
both which Inconveniences are absolutely Guarded against and shunned, by
sinking closs to the Ground, and keeping the Hilt of your Sword little higher
than your Knee, and the point little higher than your Hilt, because this po^re
prevents the playing of any of the above ^entioned low Thrusts upon you.

In the second place, I order a thinn Guard, ^cause it would be to no purpose
to sink closs, ^d endeavor by it to cover one part of your ^ody, to wit that
beneath your Sword, when (...) the same time you discover your left Side, a ^rt
of your Body, which as much if not more ^eserves to be secured, because in it
is contain(...), one of the most Noble, and (if wounded) ^ost Mortal parts of a
Man's Body, I mean ^e Heart.

Besides reason will teach a Man, that he ^ould make himself as little a mark
for his ^versary to thrust at as possible, and I know (...) better Method to do
that, than by sinking ^oss to the Ground, and keeping back your ^eft shoulder
or side, the one which is sinking, ^aking your Body shorter, and the other,
^ich is keeping back your Left Side, making your Body thinner, which two answer
the ^o things required by common and Natu^ll Reason, viz. The making a Man's
Body as short ^d narrow a Mark for his Adversary to Thrust at, as ^ssible. I
confess this Posture of sinking so closs (...) the Ground, is a little Uneasy
at first to be acquired by those who have not been accustomed to it, but a
little Practice in this, as i^ all other things, will make it become in a sho^
time as Familiar and Easy, as any other Posture; therefore let not its
Uneasiness at fir^ discourage any person from atempting to lea^ it, for the
advantage he will reap by it afterward, will sufficiently Recompense the Pai^
and Trouble he was at to make himself Master of it.

In the third Place, I order a convenien^ Guard, such as the Agility of your
Body wi^ permit, and by that I mean, that although have ordered sinking to the
Ground, and (...) Thinn Body; yet rather than that a Ma^should (by not having
that Agility of the Body and Practice requisite to perform that Posture force
and constrain himself into a Guard which would be uneasy to him, by reason o^
his endeavoring to obey exactly my Rule, (...) am rather satisfied that he
sink but so much and keep so thinn a Body as he finds himself most firm in,
and from which he is most abl^ to defend himself, and Pursue his Adversary
although it be not exactly according to the first Directions I gave him.

And the Reason for which I allow him thi^ Latitude, is because I find all
constrained Po^ stures, weaken both a Man's Defense and Pursuit, and I had
rather have a Man Play from (...) Posture wherein he can use his Vigor,
al^hough it be not altogether so secure and closs ^s I could wish it, than see
him play Feeblely and Feintly from a Posture, for which he ^ath not had
Practice enough to make it Familiar and Easy, even although that Posture)
(...) respect of another Persons Agility, may be ^ound to be the more safe, and
secure Posture of the two, because of its closness, but which cannot be so to
him, by reason of the Constraint it puts upon him.

But I give not this Allowance to make a Man negligent in acustoming himself to
a closs and thinn Guard, not at all, it is only granted to him upon Necessity
and for a time, until he has had so much Practice as to make it Familiar, and
Easy to his Body, which the sooner it be, so much the better, therefore by no
means spare either Pains or Labor to acquire it.

The Fourth thing I order is, That your Heels be still as near other as
possible, but se^ing the Reason I have for this will come more properly in,
when I speak to the Eight Rule, I shall forbear the setting it down till then,
and at present proceed to my Third Rule which is.

RULE III.
With Calmness, Vigor, and Judgemen^ make use (for your Defense) of the most
Excelle^ and not to be parallelled Contre-caveating Pa^ rade: etc.
The Reasons upon which this Rule is Grounded, are.

Because I find the Contre-caveating Parra^ to be so safe and general a
Parrade, that a Man who can rightly make use of it, needs almo^ no other, for
whereas to several of the Lesson you must use proper and particular Parrade^
such as are the Parrades which are in a manner Peculiar to Feint a la Test,
Volt-coupee, Fla^ canade: Vndercounter, etc: If you make use (...) the Contre
caveating Parrade, you save the Trouble of choosing a particular Parrade, an^
also, the running the hazard of being surpr^sed by a Quick-handed Adversary,
(who before you can well think upon what Parrade (...) most proper to Defend
the Lesson you imagin^ he is going to Play, would have the Thru^ home at you)
but making use of this Parra^ exactly, you will certainly have your desig^ of
Defending your self.

Besides in making use of other Parrades (...) man may be deceived, by reason
of his judgin^ that the thrust will be given within the Swor^ when it is really
designed to be given without, or without the Sword when it is really to be
given within, so that although a Man have (...) quick enough Parrade, and a
good Eye; yet you see he may be deceived with other Par^ades because of his
wrong judging of the com^ng in of the Thrust, but making use of this Parrade as
he should, he will never be deceived, ^or this Parrade Crosses and Confounds
the whole Art of the Sword, as Binding, Slipping, Plain thrusts, single and
double Feints of all kinds, Quarting, Volting, etc. which cannot be said of any
other particular Parrade of the Sword, but of this most Excellent Contre
caveating Parrade.

And the Reason is, because it is a Circular Parrade including a whole Circle,
whereas the other Parrades make but a Part of a Circle, and ^n so much as they
come short of the whole Circle, in so far are they Defective and Uncertain,
because the Thrust may come in at that part of the Circle, which the Parrade
^whatever one it be) left Unclosed or Unfini^hed, and therefore the second
Parrades in Quart and Terce with a Slooping Point, are more secure and certain,
although not so quick and firm, as the first Parrades in Quart and ^erce with
the Point a little higher than the Hilt, and that because these make more of a
Circle ^han their do, but this Contre-caveating Parrade is a great deal more
Secure then either of them for it makes not only one whole Circle, bu^
sometimes two or three, which is the reason (...) its so infallibly ^eeling and
Engaging the Adversaries Sword, and consequently of its being so Infallible a
Parrade.

In the Second place, I order it to be use^ generaly upon the outside, and my
Reason for that is, because first it disordereth a Man Adversaries Sword-hand
much more to Parri^ Bind or Secure him upon the Outside of h^ Sword, all which
this Parrade does, then (...) Parr^e, Bind or Secure, him upon the inside, an^
that because when you Parrie or Bind w^thi^ the Natural Posture of his hand
Facilitats bot^ his redoubling of a thrust upon you, if he desig^ it, and his
slipping you when you are goin^ to Bind him, which is just contrary when yo^
Offer to Parrie or Bind him with out, for the the disposition of his hand is so
forced out of the easy, and natural Situation of i^, that it rende^ him, if
not incapable, yet at lest a great dea^ slower both in his redoubling, and
sl^pping. An^ this is the Advantage you will reap by Parri^ing with the Co^tre
caveating Parrade upon the out Side of your Adversaries Sword.

There is yet another considerable Advantag^ which a Man may have by using this
Parrad^ and it is this, if it should be a Man's fortune (...) be Engaged in the
dark, all the Parrades in the World will never so find out, Engage, and Secure
his Adversary's sword as this will, for if a Man's Sword came in the Dark, but
within the Reach of yours, it will be impossible for you but you must feel it,
because of the Reasons above mentioned, which will be a means to Secure you
from the uncertain Attaeque of your Adversary, and also make you more certain
of what you are to do your Self, even although it be in the Dark, which is an
Advantage that no other Parrade will yield you but ^t, and therefore in my
humble opinion not to be neglected or undervalued.

The Third-thing that I ordered, was that your left hand should always assist
you, if you were any ways doubtful of the Parrade, and indeed this is so
necessary a thing, especialy in the Offensive part, that what I intend mostly
to say of it, I shall refer to my discourse upon the next Rule, (being on
Offensive one) and at present shall only say, when the Contre caveating Parrade
requires the use of the left Hand to supply its wants, with what Confidence
can the other Parrades claim the Name they have, seeing they are so deficient
(in respect of it) to give a Man that Satisfaction and Security, which but
justly he should expect, for the Labor and Pains he has been at, to
Understand, Learn, and put them in Practice.

But not to be tedious the last thing I ordered was, that to Defend your self
with the more certainty, you should look always to your Adversaries Sword-hand,
and the Reason of this is, because if you should endeavor to draw any
observation from his eyes, he may deceive you by looking in your Face, when he
intends to thrust at your Belly, or looking at your Belly when he intends to
thrust you in the Face, or if it should so fall out that your Adversary Squint,
it is in that case impossible for you by looking to such a Persons Eyes, to
Conjecture where, and at what Part of your Body, he intends to thrust.

Neither will a Man though his Adversary have a straight look perceive it well,
or be altogether certain uponwhat part of his Body the thrust is coming in, by
even looking to the Swords blade, first by Reason of its clearness which in a
manner dazelleth a Man's Eyes with the motion it makes; Secondly by Reason of
the swiftness of its motion, which is a great deal swifter then that of his
hand, for his hand being the Center, and the Swords point the circumference,
and the Sword as it were a Line Draw^ from that Circumference to the hand or
center, to^ which it is in a manner fixed, it will by a^ Mathematical
demonstration follow, that all the Parts of the Sword from the Hand to the
Poin^ make proportionably a Swifter motion then the Hand does, as they are
distant from it, and do nearer approach to the Point or Circumference: A true
Simile of which is a Wheel, the Neave or Center of which Represents the Hand,
the Spoaks the Sword, and the Rimm, or outmost Cir^umference the Swords Point;
Now set the Wheel in Motion by turning it about, and you shall perceive pretty
distinctly the Spoaks in their Motion at the Center as they are turning, but
you shall not at all perceive them in their Mo^ion at the Rimm or outmost
Circumference, by reason of the Swiftness of their Motion; it is just so with
the Motion of a Sword at the Hilt and Point.

So that, to look to the middle of a Swords Blade, or within a Foot of its
Hilt, is not so certain as to look to its Hilt, because the Motion of the
Sword, at that Foots distance from the Hilt, or at the middle of it, is a great
deal quicker, than the Motion at the Hilt, which as it was said before, is as
it were the Center, and therefore the slowest Mover, and consequent^y the
safest to look to; but to look to the Swords Point, which is the outmost
Circum^erence, is yet worst of all, for it being double the Distance from the
Center, or Hilt, that the middle of the Sword is, and every part of the Sword
moving in proportion Swiftlier, as they are farther distant from the Center, it
will by Demonstration follow, that the Motion of the Sword at the Point,
exceeds the Motion of it at the Middle, as much as the Motion at the Middle,
exceeds the Motion at the Center, or Hilt.

Therefore, to look to the Point, or Circumference of the Sword, that so a Man
may be certain of its Motion, is Ridiculous, and Uncertain, by reason of its
being the Swifrest Mover; and to look to the Middle part of the Sword, although
I confess it to be more certain than to look to the Point, yet it is also not
at all to be Trusted to, by reason that its Motion is too quick, but to look
(according to my Direction) to the Sword-hand, or Center, is a thing most
certain, and only to be Trusted to, (and that because of its slow Motion) for
the better perceiving the Motion of the Sword, and finding out where a Man
intends to Thrust, as I think I have fully Demonstrate, and with out the
Observation of which, a Man can never with Confidence, and Assurance say, tha^
he either is, or can be, Master of the Parrade.

RULE IV.
With Calmness, Vigor, and Judgment, endeavor to Offend your Adversary, by
Binding, or Securing his Sword, and that for the most part, etc.
The Reasons upon which this Rule is Grounded, are.

Because it is found that Binding, or Securing ones Adversaries Sword, before a
Man offer to give home any Thrust, (his left Hand making always a kind of
Parrade at the giving in of every Thrust) is the only Safe and Secure Play,
with either Blunts or Sharpes; to secure a Man from Contre-temps, and Thrusts
from the Resposts, which I shall endeavor to prove.

Suppose you intend but to Play a plain Thrust upon your Adversary, then unless
you first Secure his Sword, by beating it out of the way, you must certainly
Thrust straight home, without so much as regarding his Swords being just
opposite to, and presented against you, and in that Case, what should hinder
him to Thrust just as you are Thrusting, and to Contre-temps with you?

You will perhaps say, your Thrusting closs by the Feeble of his Sword, will
bear off his Thrust, or the quarting of your Head and Shoulders well will save
it; but do not deceive your self with this fancy; for in the first place I can
assure you, that although when you play upon a Masters Breast, he may suffer
you to Thrust always closs to his Sword, yet in Practice it will not be in
your power once in six Thrusts, to have the opportunity of thrusting closs to
your Adversaries Sword, and so that will not hold. But secondly, suppose you
should Thrust closs to your Adversaries Sword, and quart your Head and
Shoulders well, what does hinder your Adversary, to sink the Point of his
Sword, as you are Thrusting, and wound you at the same time in the Belly? for
it is certain your Sword cannot defend two parts at once, and if you quart your
Head and Shoulders well, and Thrust closs to your Adversaries Sword above, then
you are discovered below, which gives him the Occasion, and Opportunity, if he
can take it, to Contre-temps you, so this is as Uncertain and Unsecure as the
other, and thus in most part of the other Lessons, as well as in a plain
Thrust, does a Man expose himself.

I can only except Flancanade and Battery, but yet they are not so secure as
Binding; for Binding puts your Adversaries Sword quite out of the way, so
that if you do it Strongly and Neatly, you may have your Thrust home, and your
Body in its Defensive posture again, before his Sword come into the straight
Line betwixt your Body and his, or be in such a Disposition as he can wound you
with it, but no other Lesson does this so well as Binding, and therefore none
of them is so Good or Safe.

Its true the most part of the other Lessons do by Cunning and Subtility, as it
were Insensibly Cheat and Dukoy your Adversaries Sword out of the straight
Line, as all kind of Feints, etc. And indeed I must confess he betrays his
Ignorance but too much, who suffers himself to be so Duckoyed and Cheated, both
out of his Art, and I may say sometimes his Life, with such kind of Tricks; but
Binding does with so much Vigor and Firmness beat your Adversaries Sword, and
force it out of the way, that unless he be a great Artist, it is impossible for
him to Resist, or Oppose it: and therefore it is the only secure play to be
made use of for a Man's Life, and the only means to secure a Man, as said is.

First, from a Contre-temps, because of his Adversaries Sword being forced out
of the way by it, which incapacitates him to Thrust, until a Man has given his
thrust, and recovered himself to his Defensive Posture again; but to make sure
Work, and to prevent more certainly a Contre-temps, especially if your
Adversary should be a good Sword-man, you see I order your left Hand to make a
kind of Parrade or Defense, at the giving in of every Thrust, so that if this
be done Neatly, and with Discretion, you are a great deal more secure from a
Contre-temps, than if you did omit it; And indeed I know no other way a Man can
be certain of his Defense but this, and what I said in my Reasons to the
preceding Rule of the Contre-caveating Parrade, I may say here of Binding,
that if it stand in need of the use of the left Hand, to secure it from a
Contre-temps, what Security can a Man expect, from playing any of the other
Lessons.

But this Binding with the use of the left Hand, does not only save you as I
said from Contre-temps; But secondly, preserves you also from thrusts from the
Respost, and to make it with the use of the left Hand joined to it, yet more
effectual against Contre temps, and Thrusts from the Respost; I have joined a
great and considerable helper to it, by advising you not to rest at all upon
your Thrust, but to recover your Body instantly to your Defensive Posture,
after the giving in of every Thrust, although your Thrusts should not be
designed home, but even half Thrust; the custom of resting upon ones Thrust is
so Dangerous, and has such bad Consequences, that I am persuaded, he can never
be a good Sword man, nor play securely who is guilty of it, which I think is a
sufficient enough Reason, to make any Man of Judgment guard against it.

Now their three, viz. Binding, The Use of the left Hand and the quick
recovering of the Body after every Thrust, are so Linked together, that they
may become a certain Defense against Contre-temps, and Thrusts from the
Respost, that any one of them without the other two, would not infallibly prove
effectual, but the three being wrought and joined together, do make so strong a
Barricade, and such a secure and ^nfallible Defense, that no Contre-temps in
the World, nor any Thrusts from the Resposts, can make a breach upon it, or
render it Ineffectual.

And to make this the more clear, consider that although by Binding you may
force your Adversaries Sword out of the way; yet if he be an Artist, and have a
quick Hand, he may before your Thrust be home, bring his Sword into the right
Line again, and give you a Thrust as soon almost as you can give yours,
although you was the first Mover: now the only way to prevent this, is to
strengthen this defense of Binding, and making it more secure by joining the
second thing ordered to it, which was the help of the left Hand,
notwithstanding of which your Defense is yet uncertain, and imperfect, for
although by using your left Hand, you may turn off the Thrust he was giving
home at you, yet if you rest upon your thrust, he may alter and change the
giving in of his thrust, and so cheat and deceive your left hand. Therefore to
let your defense have all the certainty imaginable you must yet farther
strengthen it, and make it as it were impregnable, by joining to the use of the
left Hand, a quick Recovery of the Body, which Three make the Defense upon your
Pursuit mo^ Certain and Infallible, if the Fault be not you^ own, or that you
have not acquired Art enough to put them exactly in Practice.

And as for my Advice to Bind generally upon the outside of the Sword, what I
said in my Reasons to the preceding Rule, concerning the making use of the
Contre-caveating Parrade generally upon the Outside, may be also said here of
Binding generally upon the Outside, and therefore I refer you to what I said
there, not doubting but that I have fully convinced you, that (according to my
Rule) there is no True and Secure Play with Sharps, and for a Man's Life, but by
Binding, or Lessons proceeding from it, the use of the left Hand, and a quick
Recovery of the Body, perfecting with the Binding your Defense upon all your
Pursutes: But if you design not your Adversaries Life, but only to disable him,
Then.

RULE V.
With Calmness, Vigor, and Judgment, Thrust at his Sword-hand, Wrest, or Arm,
(...) at his nearest advanced Thigh, etc.
The Reasons upon which this Rule is Grounded, are.

Because I find the more home a Man plays his Thrusts, the more he exposes
himself and is liable to Thrusts from the Resposts, and albeit a Man in playing
for Life and Death, is necessitat sometimes to play home part of his Thrusts
fully to the Body; yet when he does not design the Life of his Adversary, there
is not that necessity for giving them so fully home, and so he needs not so
expose himself.

Now if he intends not to expose himself, and yet designs to disable his
Adversary, What better Method can there be, then for him to Thrust at those
parts of his Adversaries Body which lie nearest to him, and which he can reach
without almost any kind of Hazard, or stretch! of his Body, such as are the
Arm, Wrest, Sword-hand, and Thighs, and which if hit, do as soon disable a Man,
as any wounded Member of the Body, by reason of the many Veins, Arteries,
Muscles, Sinews, which are contained in them.

This is also an excellent Rule to be observed by Little, and Short Men,
against those who are Tall and Vigorous, and whose great Design is always to
Contre-temps, when a Man plays fully home any Thrust to their Body, by reason
of the Advantage they have of their long Reach or Elonge. It is also excellent
to play much from the Respost upon such kind of Persons; But I think I need say
no more for proving of this, the Rule it self being so clear that it needs no
Commentary.

RULE VI.
If your Adversary be Hasty, Passionate, and Pursue Furiously, and Irregularly,
then with Calmness, Vigor, and Judgment, etc.
The Reasons upon which this Rule is Grounded, are.

Because it is found by Experience, that nothing encourages a Man more (who is
of a Foreward Humor) to continue his violent Pursuit, than the yiedling
altogether to him, and not offering any ways to resist him; so that by
Crossing, Stopping, and Opposing his Fury, I mean that a Man should always so
soon as ever he has presented his Sword, counterfeit a Real, or make a true
half Pursuit, which are alone, and which half Pursuit will be found extremely
necessary in putting a stop to the Violence, and Fury of his Adversary.

For if you observe it, you will find for the most part, that all Foreward
Humors if given Liberty to, do Extravague extremely, and become most Insolent,
Impertinent, and Unsupportable, but if they be in the least checked, it stopeth
their Carrier, and makes them truly discover their Natural Constitution,
which is just upon the other Extreme of suffering all Reproaches, and being
Hectored and Baffled at all Hands.

But as in most part of things there is some Exceptions, so is there in this
also, because there may be some Men of a great deal of Natural Courage, who
being sensible of their own weakness and ignorance in the Art of the Sword, do
find it absolutely necessary (when it is their misfortune to be engaged) to
supply that want by brisking it out, and confounding their Adversary if
possible by their forwardness, although he be a very good Swordman, (but if he
be such, neither their Briskness nor Forwardness will do the business;) and as
I said, their Natural Force and Courage, furnish them wherewithal to push it
to the very outmost, but there are few People of this slamp to be found, and
where an Artist meets with one of those, he will meet with twenty who are such
as I before described.

But engage with whom you please, either with Ignorants of the first and second
constitution and humor, or with Artists of either, a constant and vigorous
half pursuit, (for you can turn it into a true one when you please) is the only
method to make your Art effectual, and their irregular passion and ignorant
courage, to turn into smoke, and evanish in nothing.

I need but say little of the second part of the Rule, which is, if your
Adversary should be Careless, Lash, Slow, or perhaps Timorous, that then with
Calmness, Vigor, and Judgment, you should pursue him, because if he be
Careless, he can be no great Artist, at least if he be, his Carelessness
incapacitats him from putting his Art in practice, and consequently reaping any
benefit by it, and if he be Lash, or Timorous, then although he have Art, yet
it betokens Cowardiceness, which also rendereth his Art useless to him, and
in both those Cases you will have little to do, but to Divert your self, and by
using your Art with Judgment, Convince and Demonstrate to him (by letting him
feel some of your gentlest Thrusts) how far you are Master of him, and how much
he is in your Mercy.

RULE VII.
With Calmness, Vigor, and Judgment, prevent your receiving one Thrust for
the giving another, called (after that dangerous Name, and Artists Buge bear) a
Contre-temps, etc.
The Reasons upon which this Rule is Grounded, are.

Because certainly all the Art in the World signifies not a Farthing, if a Man
cannot by it infalliby Defend himself from a Contre-temps, for what does it
avail or profit a Man, to pursue his Adversary with all the Offensive Art
imaginable, and wound him, if at the same time he is wounded himself, and that
he does not Back, or Second that his Offensive Art, or purfute, with his
Defensive Art, that so he may ^hun a Contre-temps.

Can it be any satisfaction to him, that out of Eagerness to give his Adversary
a wound, he has suffered himself by his Carelessness, to receive one perhaps
much more Dangerous? Certainly to any Artist or Man of Judgment it can be
none, but rather a matter of Regrate and Sorrow, that he should have been at so
much Pains and Trouble to acquire Art, and then to make so bad use of it, as
the ill Consequences of exchanged Thrusts do too often prove; therefore to
prevent such Mischiefs, observe this Rule, and what I have said in my Reasons
for the Fourth, where you will find full Satisfaction, and infallible
Directions both to prevent Contre-temps, and Thrusts from the Respost.

But me thinks I hear some Foreward Ignorant saying, that this Advice may be
very good for Artists to observe, who have been Taught both how to Offend their
Adversary, and also to Defend themselves, upon their Pursuit from a
Contre-temps, if their Adversary design one, but for such Ignorants as they
are, who would neither be at the Expenses to employ Masters to Instruct them in
this Art, nor if they did employ them, could take the pai^ to follow it out,
understand it, and put it in practice, it signifies nothing, and all the tim^
that is spent in either Writting, or Advising it by word of Mouth, is but so
much lost time and Labor in vain.

In Answer to which, I shall in the first place grant, that as to what relates
to them, it signifies indeed nothing, in respect that they are Ignorant, and
have not Art to make my Directions effectual, for my Advices are an Abstract of
the best Rules in Fencing, which are to be most exactly observed, by the
greates^ of Swordmen, so that to all who are either Ignorant, or who have only
the bare Theory, without Practice proportionable to it, their foregoing Advices
and Rules were never designed, a^ I before told in my Dedication.

Secondly, had I been to advise Ignorants, I would have desired them to do the
quite contrary, which is to be most Foreward, and to pursue most Furiously, and
Irregularly, and so endeavor to wound their Adversary, let it cost themselves
what it would; and the Reason is clear, because it is most evident, that all
the Advantage an Ignorant can expect to have of an Artist, must flow from his
Furious and Violent Pursuit, and endeavoring to force his Adversary to
Contre-temps with him every Thrust, (but this will have but a small Effect
against a True Artist) for if he should offer not to Pursue, but endeavor
Naturally to Defend himself, a Sword man is in that Case ^s much Master of him
in his Play, as (to make a Comparison) a Professor of Divinity is Master of a
young Student in his Theology, or an Expert Mathematician Master of one who is
but in his Institutions of Geometry.

Therefore the only Method an Ignorant should take to Baffle an Artist, is to
be Foreward and Irregular in his Motions, to see if by his Temerity and
Rambling, he can Confound and Force the Artist, because he is so ^ot and
Smartly put to it, to be satisfied to give a Contre-temps, that so he may make
himself as much as is in his power, in an equal condition with the Ignorant,
who is almost certain ^o receive a Thrust, as well as the Artist, and perhaps
more Dangerous, because of the Ar^'s knowing better to Plant and Adjust his
Thrusts than he can do; for although an Ignorant's Forewardness and Fury, may
help him to force the giving of a Contre-temps by an Artist; yet it can nowayes
teach him to Adjust his Thrust, or acquire any Advantage that way, which
undeniably, and without any manner of Debate, all Artist have of Ignorants, by
their knowing better how to Adjust and Plant their Thrusts, and will still have
so long as the other do really deserve the Name of Ignorants.

But for all I have said, I still think to hear him insist and maintain, that
even to Artists this Advice of shuning Contre-temps will but signify little,
because whoever will be but at the Trouble to visit the Fencing-schools, shall
scarcely see one Assault of ten, made either by Artists against Artists, or
Artists against Ignorants, but what is so Composed and made up of Contre-temps,
that one would think the greatest Art they learn, and aim at, is to strive who
shall Contre-temps oftnest, so that a Man is necessitat to think one of two,
either that the Art is of it self unsufficient, to give that security against
Contre-temps a Man would desire, or that the Masters play the Cheat, and teach
not so much of the security of the Art as they know, so that if the Fault be in
the Masters, they ought not to be Encouraged, or Employed and if it be in the
Art, then it is not worth the Learnning, because an Ignorant can Contretemps an
Artist, as well as the Artist, when it only pleases him, can Contre-temps, or
Exchange Thrusts with the Ignorant, which makes the Ignorant's Forewardness as
Advantageous, Profitable, and Useful to him, as all the Fallacious Tricks and
Directions, which an Artist has been at the Pains and Expenses to Understand
and Learn from his Master, can be to him, and therefore that this Advice of
mine to shun Contre-temps, is but a bare Speculation, and a thing
Impracticable, and consequently of as little use to an Artist, as to an
Ignorant.

One who is not an Artist, but such an one as the Objecter (I mean an Ignorant)
will be apt to think that what is here objected is almost unanswerable, while
in effect it is just nothing; And to give you some Satisfaction I shall take
the pains to Answer it, which I hope to all understanding Men will prove a
Motive to make them respect Fencing, and then endeavor, first to Understand
and Practice, and when once that length, then to rely upon the Certainty and
Infallibility of the preceding Rules, which upon the contrary, if not exactly
put in Practice according to my Directions, will prove both very Fallible and
Uncertain, for what I speak must be by them acted; other ways all will prove
false, and therefore if their expectation be not Answered, the Fault is their
own, and none of mine.

But as to the Answer of the Objection, I say that it is neither the defect of
the Art, which occasioneth so many Contre-temps in the Fencing-schools, because
I dare be bold to say, that whoever practices exactly the foregoing
Directions, shall infalliby prevent and shun all Contre-temps, so that if their
Rules be sufficient, and are a part of Fencing, then the Art is sufficient to
secure a Man from Contre-temps, and therefore it is not any deficiency in the
Art, which is the cause of so many Contre-temps in the Fencing-schools.

Neither is it the Masters Ignorance, who know not to Teach this secure Play,
because to my certain knowledge, the most part of them, and those who are best
employed, build their Art upon the same very Foundations and Rules which I have
given you (although I confess they are Guilty of some Abuses and Omissions in
their Schools, which I would willingly have Rectified, for which see my second
Observation) so that it cannot be their Ignorance in not knowing to Teach this
secure kind of Play, which is the cause of so many Contre-temps.

Nor is it likewise the Masters playing the Cheat, in not Teaching; or keeping
secret, and not Revealing and Discovering to their Scholars, when they give
them their Lessons, the Hazard and Danger of Contre-temps, which are exchanged
in Schools; No, the Fault lies not in any of these, but in the Scholar, who
although his Master show him the way how to prevent Contre-temps, and the
Danger that is in them; yet will not be at the pains to observe his Directions,
but will follow his own Method, because he thinks himself, if he has been
but three Months at the School, as Dexterous and Understanding as his Master,
and that he stands in need no more of his Advice, but may be his own
Governor and Director.

This is the true Reason why we see so many Contre-temps in Schools, and
consequently have so many bad Swordmen in the Kingdom, but to a true Artist
who has exactly followed his Masters Advice, and has acquired sufficient
Practice; I maintain that the foregoing Advice, will be most Seasonable,
Acceptable, and Useful, let Ignorants talk what they will.

And as for their being certain to Contre-temps with an Artist, when they
please to put themselves in that Hazard, I positively deny it, for upon the
contrary I mantain that a true Artist may, (provided he practice exactly the
foregoing Rules) infallibly save and keep himself from being Contre-temped, let
the Ignorant Force and Push as he pleases, and if the Artist do it not, it is
not the Fault, or any Defect or Unsufficiency in the Art it self, but only his
weakness, and failing to make use of the Security that his Art is able to
furnish him with; and as upon the one Hand an Artist can infallibly save
himself from a Contretemps by an Ignorant, I deny not but one Artist may
Contre-temps another, (because it is for them chiefly that this Direction or
Rule for shunning of Contretemps was designed) so upon the other, he can
infalli- Contre-temps with the Ignorant as often as he pleases, and it shall
not be in the Ignorants power to hinder or prevent him.

For you must understand that to give a true and real Contre-temps, does really
require Judgment and a swift and just Hand, as I shall immediately show you,
and here I desire you to make a Distinction, betwixt an Ignorants
Contre-temping an Artist, and his Forcing the Artist by the Violence and Fury
of his Pursuit, for his own Ease and Satisfaction to Contre-temps him, for this
Last I do not deny, but voluntarly acknowledges, that an Artist may be so
pressed, that when he finds he can do no better, he is satisfied, (rather
than to let the Ignorant have any Advantage of him) to put himself in the same
Hazard with him, by offering to Contre-temps him, and when People sometimes see
an Artist Reduced to this strait, they are so far mistaken, as to think that
the Ignorant contre-temps him, whereas it is really the Artist that
contre-tempeth the Ignorant, that he may be said to have lost no Advantage by
his Art, nor the Ignorant to have gotten any by his Ignorance and Furious
Forewardness.

But as upon the one Hand, I acknowledge that an Artist may be so pressed with
an Ignorant, that he is necessitate to Venture and Hazard a Contre-temps with
him, so upon the other, I positively deny, that it is in the power of any
Ignorant to Contre-temps a Person who is really an Artist, and my Reason is,
because as I said before, to give a real Contre-temps, does really require
Judgment and a swift and just Hand; and that no Ignorant can be supposed to
have, and that it requires those Three to make it evident thus.

If an Ignroant give a real Contre-temps, it must be given just as the Artist
is Thrusting at him, and neither before nor after, for if it be either before
or after, then it is no Contre temps; now suppose it be before the Artist
Thrust, then the Artist will not give one Thrust for another, and therefore it
is no Contre-temps, but the Fault of the Artist, who did not Defend the Pursuit
of the Ignorant, and so it is a fair Thrust, and cannot be called a Contre
temps; and if it be after the Artist has Thrust, that the Ignorant gives him
a Thrust; then neither can it be called a Contre-temps, but rather a Thrust
from the Respost; and so it was the Artists Fault in not Defending himself
better upon his own Pursuit, and not the Ignorants Judgment that made him give
it.

Now as it cannot be called a Contre-temps, which is either given before, or
after an Artist does Thrust, so that only can be called a Contre-temps, which
is given at the same very nick of time the Artist is Trusting, for then both
will undoubtedly receive a Thrust at the same time; (unless one of them prevent
it by the help of the left Hand) and this is that which can only be called a
real Contre-temps, and that an Ignorant can give this, I deny for three
Reasons; The first is, that he must have the Judgment to Time his Thrust, just
as the Artist is Thrusting; and the second, and third, that he must both have a
quick Hand to be as soon home as the Artist; and a just Hand to Plant his
Thrust right, none of which an Ignorant can be said to have; for not having the
Art of the Sword, he cannot have the Judgment of it, and without Practice
(which none will say he can pretend to) he can neither have a Just, nor Swift
Hand: And therefore that it is not in the power of an Ignorant, to give an
Artist a real Contre temps will hold good, as I think I have sufficiently made
appear. And also that to give a real Contre-temps, is required Judgment, and a
Swift and Just Hand.

And upon the contrary, that an Artist can infallibly Contre-temps with an
Ignorant, as often as he pleases, and it shall not be in the Ignorants power
to prevent it, is very clear, for the (...) Judgment, a quick Haud, and the
practice to Adjust a Thrust, being the Three things which render an Ignorant
incapable to Contre-temps an Artist, it will follow, that an Artist having
these three Advantages, they give to him that, which the want of them divest
the Ignorant of; so that the Ignorant being rendered incapable to Contre-temps
by the want of them, by the Rule of Contraries, the Artist by having them, is
made capable to Contre-temps the Ignorant, when and how often he pleases.

So by this time, I doubt not but you are sensible of the weakness of the
Objection, and how unreasonable and frivolous it is, and also understand what
Advantages a Man's Art gives him upon the one Hand, and what Inconveniences
and Hazards his Ignorance upon the other does expose him to; and if so, then I
need not inquire which of the two you had rather be, whether a Judicious
Artist, or a Furious and Foreward Ignorant; seeing your very Favoring the one,
would accuse you of Folly; and your Despising the other, discover your Sloth
and Carelessness.

RULE VIII.
Now to put a close to my Rules, let them be all done within Distance as much
as possible, etc.
The Reasons upon which this Rule is Grounded, are.

Because the closer a Man play to his Adversary (if he be Master of the
Defensive part) he plays so much the securer for himself, and is in a better
Capacity to Hurt or Offend his Adversary, then when he is without Distance, and
is necessitate before the giving in of every Thrust to approach, for this both
disordereth his own Body, by exposing it more to the Contre-temps of his
Adversary, and also makes his Pursuit not so effectual, in respect that it is
not so quick and smart, as when it is done within Distance; For playing within
Distance, all your Thrusts may be given in the twinkling of an Eye, and a
great deal more certain as to the Planting, being only done with the Spring of
your Arm, and without almost any Elonge of the Body, which are the second and
third things advised in this last Rule

Now it is most certain, that all Thrusts given only with a Spring or Jerk of
the Arm, are a great deal more Strong, Quick, and Firm, then when they are
performed with an Elonge, because the Elonging or Stretching the rest of your
Body, weakneth and takes away both the Force of the Spring, and Quickness of
the Thrust: Therefore to Play only with a Spring of the Arm, and with as little
a Stretch or Elonge as possible, is the only best way to play both smartly, and
securely: besides if a Man accustom himself to great Stretches, he runs
into two Inconveniences, the one is the exposing his Body by it to the
Contre-temps, and Thrusts from the Respost of his Adversary, which if he did
not stretch, would not be so much exposed; The other is the Danger he puts
himself in, if his Feet should slip, and he fall, which is also prevented if he
play within Distance, only with a Spring of the Arm, and with little or no
Stretch: And therefore if it were but only upon this one Account, I think a Man
should shun Stretching as much as possible. A Man has likewise this Advantage
by playing closs to his Adversary, that it preventeth the Variety of Lessons
which would make him the more uncertain of the Parrade.

But that you may the better do it, I gave you an Advice in my second Rule,
which will be of great use to prevent your Stretching, and it was, That you
should still keep your Heels as near other as possible, which I omitted to
speak to in that place, thinking it to come more a Propos here; now if you but
consider it, you will find that this keeping of your Heels near other, when you
are even without Distance, but more especially when you are within, does make
your Thrust come the farther home, and reach your Adversary with a far less
Stretch of the Body, then if your Heels were keep a good way asunder, so that
playing within Distance, as I order you, if your Heels be closs, the stepping
foreward a Foot, with your advanced Foot, will bring your Thrust as far home,
as your full Stretch would have done, if your hindmost Heel had been far
distant from your advanced; so that keeping your hindermost Heel, closs almost
to your advanced Heel and being within Distance, you will almost without any
Stretch of the Body, only by stepping foreward a little with your advanced
Foot, and using the Spring of your Arm, sheath your Sword to the very middle in
your Adversarie's Body, if he do not oppose you.

But this is not all the Advantage you reap by keeping your Heels near; for it
not only carries home your Thrust father; but also is a great means to help
you to recover your Body quickly after every Thrust, which was one of the
Particulars I advised in the fourth Rule. Now it is clear, that so long as a
Man plays at his full Stretch, he can never so quickly recover his Body, as
he can do when he is at a half Stretch, nor so soon at a half Stretch, as he
can do when he makes little or no Stretch; and seeing the keeping of his hinder
Heel near to his advanced, preventeth his Stretching, and the less that he
Stretches, the quicklier he will recover his Body, then it does certainly
follow, that the keeping his Heels near other, is a great means to facilitate
the quick recovery of his Body after every Thrust, which was that I designed to
prove.

So there remains only, that I should speak to the third thing proposed in my
first Rule, which I delayed till now, designing to close the Reasons for my
Rules with a short Discourse upon it, which is also the last Advice in this my
last Rule, to wit, That Judgment accompany all your Actions, both in their
Beginning, Procedure, and Close; and indeed without it all I have said would
signify but little, for to make a short Detail, What would it signify to you?
your having Calmness, and Vigor, if you had not Judgment to direct you, how
to make use of the Advantage you have by them; And what would the keeping of a
Closs and Thinn Guard signify to you, if you had not your Judgment in
defending yourself upon it, or pursuing your Adversary from it; What would it
signify also to you, that you have Directions to prevent Contre-temps, if you
have not Judgment to know when to Practice them, and in short what does the
whole Art of the Sword signify without Judgment, certainly for very little or
no use at all.

Now as upon the one Hand an Artist is liable to a great many Inconveniences
by the want of it, so upon the other his having it, purteth him in a Capacity,
and sets him at Liberty, notwithstanding my Directions I have given him,
(although I confess they are the securest I can think upon, or imagine) to
choose what Parrades, and what Lessons he shall think most fit and agreeable
to the Constitution, Play, and Humor of his Adversary, although those Lessons
which he might pitch upon in respect of some Men's play, would be found to be
most loose and uncertain; but in respect of the Person he is to play them upon,
Judicious and Good, because by his Judgment he has found that such Lessons
will have as good effect against such a Person, as the most secure against one
of another Humor, for if it were other ways, and had not his Liberty of
choose, he would then be tied up, and confined to my Directions; or I may say,
to my particular Judgment, which is the rendering his own useless, and is just
contrary to what I so much recommended; but there must be great care taken,
that a Man abuse not this Liberty, and Allowance which is given him, and that
he be certain his Judgment be not false, but Grounded upon Art and Reason
before he Adventure, and take upon him to make any considerable Change or
Alteration in Directions, which in the strickest Sense must be confessed to be
the most secure, against all Play and Humors whatsoever.

But that I may end this with a Comparison, Fencing without Judgment, is just
like a Watch without a Spring, a Neat piece of Work with a great many fine
Wheels, but without any Motion, the want of which makes her useless: And so is
the Art of Fencing a curious Art, wherein there are a great many fine Lessons,
and excellent Rules, but for lack of Judgment (which is its Spring) all lies
Dead, and is Useless; but once apply the Spring, and set it in Motion and a
going, and then it becomes a most Quick and Lively Exercise, and (as a Watch)
an Ornament fit for all Gentlemen to carry about with them, and as a complete
Watch with a Spring shows a Man the Hour of the Day, that so he may know how
to dispose of his time and actions; so does Fencing directed by Judgment,
discover to a Man the Hazards and Inconveniences he is exposed to, and the
means to shun and prevent them, by his disposing of the several Branches of his
Art so and so, as she shall direct him.

And farther, as the Spring of a Watch does cause its Hand to point to that
Hour, which is most needful to be known; so does Judgment direct a Man's Hand,
to point with his Sword, and Thrust at such parts of his Adversarres Body,
which do most expose and discover themselves to him, and which are therefore
the most fit to be Attacqued; so that without her, there can be no true Artist,
and where she presides, all will go well, and as one would wish that is, make
the preceding Rules answer my Design, which was, infallibly to direct a Man,
to defend himself against the Attacques of all Persons with Sharpes, which I
doubt not but I have sufficiently done, if they be exactly observed; and I am
confident, if they fail, it can be imputed to no defect in the Directions, but
to the weakness and want of Art in the Person, who is to put them in practice,
and therefore the blame must lie at their Door, and not at mine; for it is
Acting, and not Talking, that in this Case must do the Business.

Having now finished my Rules, with the Reasons upon which they are Grounded, I
shall in the last place proceed to the third thing I at first proposed, which
was, to give you some Observations, which will be neither Unnecessary, nor
Unpleasant.

Thirdly, Some REMARKES and OBSERVATIONS, etc.
IN the First place I observe, let Ignorants talk what they please, and
undervalue both Art and Artists as much as is in their power; yet still it is
an undeniable Truth, that Artists have three considerable Advantages of them,
which is, first, The knowing to Parrie, and actually Parreing a plain Thrust,
better than they can do; For I shall Engage for what any Man pleases, That,
set up an Ignorant to me at the Wall, who was never taught any thing of the Art
of the Sword; I shall with the Art I have, give him half a Dozen plain Thrusts
distinctly one after another, and it shall not be in his power to Parrie, or
Defend himself from one single Thrust of all the six, and upon the other Hand,
let him Thrust at me twenty plain Thrusts at the Wall, he shall not Touch me
with one of them; And if this be true (which may be easily put to a Trial,
whether it be so or not) then certainly the Artist as I said, has this first
Advantage of an Ignorant, that he can Parrie and Defend himself better then the
Ignorant can do for his Heart.

But perhaps when some Persons are reading this, who have seen me when I have
been in the Fencing-schools, receive either plain Thrusts at the Wall, from
those who were Thrusting upon me, or in Assault when I was playing as the would
judge my best, they will be apt to challenge me, and ask how I come to Assert
things, the contrary of which they have seen with their own Eyes; As first,
That I have been so far from Parreing twenty plain Thrusts upon end, that they
have seen me hitt once in three or four; And secondly, That in Assaulting,
notwithstanding the many exact Rules I pretend to give, to save a Man from
Contre-temps; yet they have seen me several times Contre-temped, and it is
probable, that if I could not Defend my self with my own Rules from
Contre-temps, another will hardly do it: Therefore my Rules will not prove so
very infallible as I imagine them to be, and that I should not have been so
positive in the Commendation of them, seeing that I my self know them to have
failed me, in that which I do most commend them for, viz. Their security
against Contre-temps.

I know their will be the Thoughts and Objections of some, who will peruse their
Sheet more out of a Curiosity to get something to Object against me, then a
desire to reap any Profit or Advantage by them, and therefore I thought fit to
set them down in this place, that so I might Answer them.

As to the first, I do not believe that any Man will say, he ever saw me
receive a plain Thrust at the Wall from any Ignorant, which is what I affirmed,
I would Defend my self from; for if I were not able with the Art I have
certainly to Defend my self at the Wall, from the plain Thrusts of all
Ignorants, I should then throw down my Fleuret, and undervalue Fencing so much,
that I should never more enquire after it, or any ways, encourage the
Professors of it, but should do all that lay in my power to discover its
insufficiency, that Gentlemen might not be for the Future Imposed upon and
Cheated, both out of their Money and Time by it. But although I deny my being
hitt at the Wall by the plain Thrusts of Ignorants; yet I confess I have been
often hitt by Artists, and I do not almost remember that ever I was bitt with
plain Thrusts, since I understood any thing of this Art, but what was given me
either by those who were actually Scholars at the Time, and therefore were no
Ignorants; or those who had been once Scholars, and therefore also no ways
deserved the Name of Ignorants, and for my being hitt with a plain Thrust by
such, I do no deny it, neither does it any ways reflect upon me, because for
one Sword-man to be hitt with a plain Thrust by another, is no Disparagement at
all, but a very considerable one it is, if an Artist cannot infallibly Defend
himself against the plain Thrusts of any Ignorant, and that I am not able to do
that, I positively deny, and refers the Probation of it to a Trial, when ever
it shall be required by Persons who are worth the giving Satisfaction to in
such a Matter; therefore when such Persons accuse me of being hitt with plain
Thrusts, they would do well to be so ingenuous as to confess, that those
Thrusts were really given me by Artists, which I shall willingly confess, and
not by Ignorants, which I positively deny, for if that were, they would indeed
have good Reason to laugh both at me, and my Directions.

But as to the second, which is, My receiving Contre temps in Assaults,
notwithstanding of what I could do to prevent them, which not only discovers
the insufficiency of my Rules to prevent Contre-temps, but also my disingenuity
in Commending, and Accounting Rules to be Infallible, which I by my own proper
Experience have found oftener then once, to be both Fallible and Uncertain.

This Objection I confess comes somewhat closer to me than the former did, and
I believe I have started it so fairly, that none who considers either this or
the former, but will confess, I have said as much both against my self, and to
make this Art of no Repute, as any Ignorant whatsoever could do, and I the
rather like to make all the Objections possible against it, that People may be
convinced I deal above Board, and that there lies no Cheat in the Matter; and
that also by Answering all Objections, I may in a manner (by reasoning so
fairly with them) force them to confess and acknowledge, that the Art of the
Sword is not only a Pleasant, but also an Useful and Necessary Art, worthy of
the Study of all, but more especially of the Gentry.

But in Answer to the Objection, although I confess I have received many
Contre-temps, and notwithstanding of all the Art I have, do still Fear them
when I am Assaulting, and although I might also allege what I did in the
Answer, to the preceding Objection, that all the Contre-temps ever I received
were from Artists, (for I positively deny that any Ignorant can give an Artist
a real Contre-temps, which I sufficiently made appear in my Reasons for the
Seventh Rule, to which I refer you) and the most part of the Thrusts, that were
Exchanged one for another, were also for the most Part from Artists and not
from Ignorants, and consequently no disparagement to me; yet passing by that,
and granting these exchanged Thrusts were given by Ignorants, I shall give you
two Reasons, the one showing why any Artist, be he never so Expert, may come to
receive one Thrust for another from an Ignorant, and the other showing that he
may receive either a real Contre-temps, or one Thrust for another from an
Artist, and yet that it can be no reflection upon my Rules, which, as I said,
will prove still infallible if exactly observed.

And the Reason of the first (which is, any Artists receiving one Thrust for
another from an Ignorant) is that when People Assault, it is commonly with
Blunts, and when an Ignorant who undervalueth the Art of the Sword, and
trusts all to his own Forewardness i^ desired by an Artist to show his
Natural Play, he very well considering that he can receive no prejudice by his
being hitt with a blu^t Fleuret, Rusheth and Rambleth still forewards (let him
receive never so many Thrusts) until he either hitteth the Artist with one of
his Rambling Thrusts, or other ways comes so closs, that the Artist must
enclose with him, and he thinks, if he has given the Artist but one Thrust
(although he himself should receive three or four in the time they are playing)
that he has carried the Day, and quite run down the Art of Fencing, whereas if
they were either to play with Real Sharps, or with Fleurets having a quarter of
an Inch of a point beyond the button, I make not the least doubt, but their
rambling would be a little slower, and they would take better notice to what
they did, it being Natural even for the most Foreward and Boldest of Men, to
endeavor to save themselves by putting a little stop to their Pursuit, when
they perceive a Sharp point opposite to, and ready to wound, them, and without
which stop or pause, they are sensible they might run the Risk, if not of
losing their Life; yet at least of being hurt, and so smarting for their rash
Fotewardness: so this is the Reason why Artists may receive one Thrust for
another from Ignorants, to wit, Their Assaulting commonly with B^unts;
Therefore to prevent this inconveniency, if I were to play with an Ignorant for
a Wager, I would play always with pointed Fleurets, and then in GOD's Name let
him Ramble his Belly full; For in that case I would know a way to come at him,
which might perhaps cause him repent his Forewardness.

But the Reason of the second, (which is that an Artist may either receive a
Real Center temps or one Thrust for another, (commonly called Exchanged
Thrusts) from another Artist) is that although they play never so warrily, yet
if they fail in the least, to make use of the exact contraries to Contre-temps
and Thrusts from the Respost, which I have given them, they expose themselves
to both, and I must confess, the Directions are so Nice and Difficult to be
performed, that there are even but few Swordmen, who are able to put them
exactly in practice; so that it is not the defect of the Rules, but the Fault
of the Artist, in not observing them strictly in practice, that is, the cause
of his being either Hitt, Contre-temped, or Resposted: This Reason I also give
for my receiving any of the Three in Assault from Artists, or the first and
last from Ignorants; and I much doubt, if it be possible for ordinary Artists
to observe them altogether exactly, however, the nearer they come to the exact
Observance of them, they are certainly so much the securer; And if it be asked
why I give Rules so difficult, that neither, I my self, nor other Swordmen
when they are even at their greatest perfection can without a great deal of
difficulty exactly observe? It is Answered, That in this, I Resemble the
Divines, who although they give most excellent Rules for Holy Living and Dying,
which cannot but be confessed by all Christians, to be most Rational and
Orthodox; yet find great Difficulty themselves to Live up to that pitch of
Mortification and Holiness, which they require exactly of others under the pain
of Eternal Damnation; and yet none will be so bold as to say, because those
Rules are not but with great Difficulty exactly observed, that therefore they
are not sufficient, and infallibly certain, to bring Salvation to all who
exactly observe, and square their Lives and Actions conform to them: The
Parallel I confess betwixt thirtwo Subjects is altogether unequal; yet the
Comparison will hold good, that although an Artist may receive a Thrust, or be
Contre-temped or Resposted, because of his failing to observe exactly my
Directions; yet that the Directions may be, and are in themselves absolutely
sufficient and infallible, for the preservation of one who exactly observes
them, from all kind of Thrusts whatsoever, I doubt not but what I have said,
will be thought to be, by all rational Men, a sufficient Answer, both to the
Objections, and for proving the sufficiency of my Rules, therefore I shall
proceed where I left; And show, that.

The second Advantage Artists have over Ignorants, is, in Planting or Adjusting
a Thrust, which no Man will controvert, seeing it is not to be imagined, that an
Ignorant who perhaps did never thrust six Thrusts in his Lifetime, can be so
certain to hitt the part of the Body he aims at, as an Artist will be, who
has bee^ taught how to Plant, and is now and then practicing himself with it.

And the Third is the having of Judgment, for I suppose all Artists to have
that, otherwise they are really no Artists but Ignorants in Masquerad, that is
to say, they pretend to Art, because they have been some time at the Fencing
school, and so under that Cloak of being once a Scholar, they conceal their
Ignoraec^; but if they be real Artists they must have the Judgment of the
Sword, and that no Ignorant can have, because it is unseparably joined to the
Art it self, and is only acquired by practicing of it, and that no Ignorant can
pretend to, who never was at the Pains and Trouble, so much as to enquire after
it, let alone to be at the Toil to gain it by practice, which is the only true
way to come at it.

Now the Advantage an Artist has over a^ Ignorant, by having this Judgment,
is that by it he can know when such and such a Part o^ his Adversaries Body is
open to him, and wha^ Lesso^s are most proper to offend such parts as are
exposed, and even although his Adversary should not be Open but upon a Closs
Guard, i^ surn sheth him with means to make him discover himself and give an
Open: As also i^ Teatheth him in some measure to understand and know, when, and
at what part of his own Body, his Adversary designs to Attacque him: all this
and a great deal more it does to an Artist, but an Ignorant not having it, he
is frustrate of all these preceding Advantages, and therefore certainly at a
great deal of loss for the want of it, so that it cannot be denied, but this of
having Judgment is the Third considerable Advantage, that all true Artists
have over Ignorants. I could give you several other Instances in which Artists
have considerable Advantages, but I think what I have said sufficient as to
this Particular.

Secondly, I observe that in the Fencing schools (and that not only of this
Kingdom, but England and France also) there are several Abuses, and things
committed which I would have rectified, both for the Benefit of the Scholars,
and Reputation of the Masters; although I know it will be thought somewhat
strange, that after having said so much in Commendation of Fencing it self, I
should at last reflect upon its Professors and Teachers.

But to that I Answer, That although the Art be Grounded upon undeniable Truths
and infallible Reasons; yet that is no Argument, but many who profess it may be
subject to Errors, for I am far from attributing Infallibility to them: And I
confess I am sorry, I should be necessitate to differ from many o^ them, in
circumstances so considerably tending to the accomplishment and perfecting of
Sword men, but my Opinion being backed with so many, and strong Reasons (the
Truth and Weight whereof I earnestly recommend to the serious Reflection of the
Reader,) I cannot but maintain and defend it; until by as strong and convincing
Reasons as I have given for it, I am persuaded of the contrary.

Seeing therefore my Proposals are grounded upon Reason, and not upon other Men's
practices, I expect they will convince me by it, for that practice which is
against Reason, is but deceitful and false, and as it is to the Eternal Fame of
the great DUKE of Newcastle, that he was the first who Rectified the Abuses of
Riding in the Academies, by finding out a new and infallible Method for
dressing Horses, which was not thought of before, and which at first had no
doubt many Opposers, until from the reasonableness and great Success it had,
they were necessitate to acknowledge its Excellency and Certainty: So I hope I
shall have the Honor to be one of the first who has publicly proposed the
Rectifying of Abuses commonly committed in Fencing schools.

The first whereof is, The giving Scholars at their very first Entering to the
School, heavy Fleurets to take their Lessons with; And the Reason they give is,
Because (say they) the using a weighty Fleuret strengthens their Arms and
Wrests, and makes them when they come afterward to Assault with light
Fleurets, to handle them a great deal more Easily and Nimbly, then they would
have done, had they been still, accustomed to play with light ones.

All this I grant, for it cannot be denied, but that which I condemn, is, their
giving these heavy Fleurets to Scholars at their very first entering to them,
when they understand not so much as how to give in a Plain Thrust, or to move
their Fleuret regularly any way, for it is certain that they never being
accustomed to move their Wrests, the first time that they use that Motion it
will be a trouble to them, and make their Sinews Ache, although they had
nothing in their Hands at all, let alone a stiff heavy Fleuret, just as a Man
when he is first Learning to Elonge or stretch, the Sinews of his Thighs will
Ache for a Day or two after, although he force not himself to a full stretch:
And as it would be thought a little strange for a Master to force a young
Scholar the very first or Second Day after his first entering to the School to
his full Stretch, or before he has by custom made Elonging familiar and easy
to him; so I say, at the beginning a Scholar should make use of a very light
Fleuret until by a little Practice and Use, his Wrest be acquainted with the
turns of the Parrades and Motions of the Lessons, and then, and not till then
(which will be about three Weeks, or a Month at most after his first entering)
should be given him a weighty Fleuret to strengthen his Wrest and Nerves, and
with that he should always take his Lessons, and Parrie his Adversaries plain
Thrusts at the wall, the using of which, will undoubtedly make him handle a
light Fleuret or Sword, as he shall have occasion for them, a great deal more
firmly and nimbly, then if he had always used a light Fleuret.

For (to make a Comparison) as it is the Common Custom for Dancing Masters
abroad, to wear plates of Leed betwixt the plies of the Soles of their Ordinary
walking Shoes, that so they may seel themselves as it were Lighter, and
Cleevrer, when they put on their Light Dancing Shoes; so will the constant
using of weighty Fleurets, make Men when they are to assault with Light ones,
or to make use of their Sword, to think them a great deal Lighter then really
they are, and the very Fancy of that will cause them make both, their Parrades,
and Thrusts quicker then otherwise they would; But, as I said, their Wrests
should be always made Supple, and first accustomed with very Light Fleurets,
until they be three Weeks or a Month at School, and then it is a (...) time to
give them heavy Fleurets to take their Lessons withal and not sooner, unless
their Masters design to weaken and ruin their Wrests and Nerves. And this
Leads me to

The Second thing I observe, is not so much Practiced in our Scots and English
Schools as I ^ould wish (for I acknowledge the French ^re free of it) which is
the constant Parreing, and Thrusting of Plain Thrusts upon one another at the
wall, this is the only thing which makes a Man to have a Swift Hand upon his
Pursuit, and a firm and sure Parrade upon his Defense, and there is no other
Reason for the French their having so Swift a Hand in giving in their Plain
Thrusts, but their constant accustoming themselves to Thrust upon their
commarads at the Wall, or sometimes at a Mark in the Wall, when they want the
opportunity of having one to Thrust upon; therefore seeing the having a Swift
Hand is of such advantage, and the most certain way to acquire it, is, to
frequent the Thrusting and Parreing of Plain Thrusts at the Wall, and that (as
I have Orderd), with heavy Fleurets I think it will be thought but Reasonable
that I advise the Rectifying of this, as well as the preceding abuse.

The Third thing I observe, is, that they burden their Scholars with too many
Lessons, especially Offensive ones, whereas if they would teach them fewer
Offensive Lessons (for they will come to them Naturally) and keep them closer
to the Defensive Part, People would see fewer Contre-temps, and better
Swordmen in the Schools, then for the most Part they do.

The fourth, is, the suffering Scholars generally to take their Lessons in
their Clothes, a thing which hinders a Man's Body to be so soon broken, and
made Pliable as otherwise it would, because a Man cannot stretch so freely in
his Coat as he can do in a West-coat, or Vest, and also it spoileth his Cloths,
and if he Fenceth much, the sweat makes him uneasy the whole Day thereafter,
whereas Playing in a West-coat a Man is both Nimbler, and more at ease the rest
of the Day, his Coat being dry when he goes from the School, which perhaps
otherwise would be all torn and neastie with the smell of Sweet and dust,
which would be both uneasy to him, and unpleasant to those he is going to
converse with

Therefore in my humble opinion no Scholat should be suffered to take his
Lessons in his Clothes until he be well Grounded, and then in opposition to
what I have been saying, I am of the opinion that he should for the most part
both take his Lessons, and Assault in his Clothes and walking Shoes, for this
will confirm him in his Play, and make him upon all Encounters ready, without
being surprised, to oppose the Pursutes and Attaques of his Adversary, with as
great ease, as if he were stripped and in his Fencing shoes, now this being of
great Importance to Complete and Confirm a Swordman in his Play, it should by
all means be looked to and taken notice of, that Scholars before they be well
Grounded both in Lessons and practice, do not Play in their Clothes, and that
afterward when they are Grounded they should, to strengthen and confirm them
in it

The Fifth is the suffering Scholars so soon in Assault before they be at
least of two or three Months standing, and this is also one of the Reasons, why
People see so many Contre-temps exchanged in the Schools, because when they
begin to Assault so soon, they have neither Art nor Judgment to shun or
prevent them: and were it for no more but this, I think the Masters should
rectify it, that they would find it for their own particular Profit and
Advantage; for when once their Scholars are accustomed to Assault, they think
it almost below them to take any more Lessons, but think they have attained
enough of the Art, and so Quite the School, and there is an end of them, and by
being at the School, they get the Name of Swordmen which is enough to them,
but GOD knows, if they really deserve it, whereas as if they were kept longer
from Assaulting they would both continue longer their Scho^lars, and at the end
prove better Swordmen.

The Sixth and last thing I shall take notic^ of in Fencing Schools, is the
neglect of teaching the Blow as well as the Thrust, and this both the English
and French Masters are guilty of, a well as our Scots; And I am apt to think it
may proceed from a mistake, in thinking that the teaching of the Blow would be
prejudicial t^ the quick performance of the Thrust, but who^ ever may be
prepossest with this false Opini^ on, I shall endeavor to convince them of the
contrary by what follows, and of the nece^sity there is for a Man's being
taught, and understanding both Blow and Thrust, to be reputed a Complete
Sword-man.

Now the chief reasons, or objections they give against teaching of the Blow,
or Broad-sword at the same time with the Small, are three; The first is, that
it does not teach a Man to stretch himself so much as the small Sword does, and
therefore will not supple and break his Body so well, and consequently not give
him that agility of Wrest and Limbs, which the Sm^ Sword does.

In answer to which I say first, that it is a great mistake, to think that the
Blow does no^ teach a Man to stretch, as well as the Thrust. ^t in Learning the
Thrust, there is nothing that ^aketh a Man to stretch, and to acquire
nim^leness and agility in his Limbs, but Advancing, ^eteiring, Elonging, and
sometimes Jumping ^ack after the giving in of a Thrust, now all this Man does
when he is taught the Blow, or ^iad-sword, and therefore there is no difference
^etwixt the learning of the Broad-sword, and ^mall, for the acquiring of
agility and nim^leness.

I know some will say, that the chief difference ^onsists in the Elonging,
because in learning the ^al-sword, a Man is taught to stretch himself a great
^eal more, then when he is learning the broad; or ^k-sword; but this is
likewise a mistake, because ^ose who teach the true Art of the Broad-sword,
ansetheir Scholars when they take their Lessons, ^ake their full Elonges or
Stretches, and like^ise recover, and jump backoff those Stretches, ^s
frequently, as if they were taught the Small, and those Masters who teach not
the Broad; or Back(...) after this manner, discover only their (...) Ignorance,
but no imperfection in the Art: and although I am fully persuaded, that the
Small-sword has the Advantage of the Broad, as to the quickness and subtility
of its Motions; yet I ^m convinced it has no Advantage over it, ^s to the
rendering a Man more Agile and Nim-ble; And therefore that the teaching of the
Blow at the same time with the Thrust, ca^ be no ways prejudicial to the quick
performance of the Thrust afterward, as a man shall have occasion for it.

Secondly, I say the teaching of the Blow a the same time with the Thrust, is
not only as have made appear, no ways prejudicial to a Man's stretching his
Body and Limbs, but also does not hinder him to acquire that agility and
nimbleness of the Wrest, which is required to have a swift Hand in the giving
in of an^ Thrust, for let any Man but consider the turn of the Wrest in making
any of the Parrades, o^ playing any of the Lessons belonging to the
Small-sword, and the turns of it in performing the Blows and Flourishes of the
Broad, and he will find the turns in the Broad to be a great dea^ more Circular
and difficult, and consequently fitter for the Suppling and Breaking of a Man's
Wrest, that so it may become Nimble and Agile, then any Parrade or Lesson of
the Smal^ and there is no great Wonder it should be so, seeing it has its Rise
and foundation from the Art of the Broad, for I believe there are but few who
are Ignorant of the antiquity of the Art o^ the Broad-sword, and how that it
was long made use of before ever the Small was found out, or heard of, and I am
so far from thinking the Art of the Small-sword a particular Art by it self,
that I am fully convinced, it is only the Art of the Broad more refined, and
made more perfect, in so far as at first the Blow was only made use of without
any Thrust, and the Art of the Smal-sword perfecteth it, by teaching how the
Thrust may be joined to the Blow without any the least confusion, or
hinderance, of the Blow, as occasion shall offer. Now how the teaching of both
at one and the same time has run into desuetude, I confess I cannot
comprehend, but certainly it is a ^eglect and omission, which all who desire to
be complete Swordmen, should endeavor to have rectified.

The Second objection is, that grant the teaching of the Blow at the same time
with the Thrust, does not hinder a Man's Stretching, or his acquiring the same
agility of Body and nimbleness of Wrest, which he would do if he were only
taught the Small; yet say some, there is such a vast difference betwixt the
performance of a Blow, and the giving in of a Thrust, that if a Man were taught
to do them both at one time, the one would quite confound the other, and make a
Man when he is taking his Lesson with the Small, to give a Blow when he should
give a Thrust, and when he is taking his Lesson with the broad, to give in a
Thrust when he should make a Blow, which would render both the Arts altogether
useless to him; and therefore a Man had better perfect himself fully in the
one, before he attempt the other, then desire to be taught them both at one,
and the same time

Here is (one would think) a very strong and reasonable objection, but yet it
shall be very clearly and shortly answered, and first, I say betwixt the
Parrades and Guards of the Broadsword, and Parrades and Guards of the Small, at
least the most part of them, there is but little Difference: for the Parrades
in Quart and Terce of the Medium-guard, do resemble the first Parrades in Quart
and Terce of the Smal-sword, and the Parrads of the Hanging-guard, do likewise
resemble the second Parrades in Terce of the Smalsword with a slooping point:
thus much for the Parrades, and as for the Guards, the posture of the
Medium-guard is little Different from that of the Quart-guard in the Small, the
outside-guard little different from the Terce, and the Hanging-guard little
different from the Terce-guard in the Smal-sword with a slooping point; so that
the difference that are betwixt the Parrades and guards of the Small sword, and
Parrades and Guards of the Broad are so inconsiderable, that I am confident no
Man who understands both, will say, that the teaching the Parrades and Guards
of the one can be any ways Prejudicial to the teaching the Parrads and Guards
of the other at the same time.

But Secondly if there be any considerable difference, it lies in the
offensive part; in that, there is as they say, a vast difference betwixt the
delivering of a Blow, and the giving in of a Thrust, and this is that which
they maintain will so much Confound a Man that it will make him Strike when he
should Thrust, and Thrust when he should Strike.

For my part, I confess I cannot but admire how People of Judgment can talk at
this rate, for can there be a greater Difference betwixt the performance of any
Stroke, and the giving in of a Thrust, then there is betwixt the performance of
one Lesson in the Smal-sword, and the Playing another in the same Art no
certainly, for there is as great, yea more Difference betwixt a Plain Thrust,
and Feinta la test, or betwixt Feint a la test, and Binding, or betwixt Binding
and Passing, or betwixt Passing and Quarting and Volting, then there can be
pretended to be betwixt the giving in of a Thrust, and the making of any Blow
whatsomever, so that if upon the one Hand it be Pleaded that the Difference
betwixt Blow and Thrust, is the Reason why they should not be taught together,
because the one would confound the other, I plead upon the other Hand and for
the same Reason, that nothing should be taught of the Small sword at the same
time but a Plain Thrust, because the Difference betwixt it and the other
Lessons is as considerable, if not more; and therefore as apt to confound a
Man, because when he should Play one Lesson, he will make use of another as far
out of purpose and season, as the making of a Blow would be when he should give
a Thrust, but all this is so ridiculous, that I shall say no more of it; for a
Man who will maintain this, must also maintain, that a Man cannot learn any two
different Exercises at once, as for Ex: the Exercises of the Pick and Musket,
or to Play upon the Guittar and Lute, or to Dance a Courant and Minue without
confounding the one with the other, because they have all Different Motions,
which is a most extravagant opinion, and the contrary of which we see daily
practiced not only by Men, but even by Beasts; for I believe there are but few
Gentlemen who have been abroad, and have not seen Horses when they have been
either Breaking for the Manage, or to confirm them in it, get most different
Lessons for that effect in one Morning, as one to supple their Shoulders,
another to put them upon their Haunches, one for Passager, another for the
Terra a Terra, one for Corvetting, another for Crouppading, and in fine, one
for Caprioling, and another for Balotading, and all this (as I said) in one
Morning, now the motions of the Horses limbs are different in all those Lessons
and Aires, and seeing the difference of the motions does not confound an
irrational Horse, nor hinder him to perform what ever Lesson or Air his Rider
requires of him; I conclude, That the difference betwixt Blow and Thrust, will
far less confound or hinder a Rational Man to make use of either, as it shall
please him, or his Master to demand them of him. But that I may the better both
vindicate my Opinion as to this, and persuade you, that it is not merely a
speculative fancy, but a most practicable, and useful improvement of the Art
of the Sword; I do recommend to all who shall not be convinced of it by the
reasonable Arguments I have proposed, that they would Repair to William
Machries School, where they will see both Blow and Thrust, taught at the same
time with a great deal of ease and expedition, and without the least confusion.

The third and last objection, is this, that supposing the Teaching of the Blow
at the same time with the Thrust, be no ways prejudicial to the quick
performance of the Thrust, and that all I said in favors of the Blow should
hold good and true, yet it is altogether unnecessary to teach the Blow, because
a Man that is absolutely Master of the Thrust, can supply all the wants of the
Blow by it, and seeing the Thrust has so great Advantage over the Blow, as to
the danger and deadliness of its wounds, which no Sword-man will deny, and that
it can always be made use of in place of a Blow, therefore the Teaching of the
Blow is not necessary, but ought to be foreborn.

You see by this objection they endeavor wholly to condemn and exclude the
Blow, not as being any ways prejudicial to the quick performance of the
Thrust, but as being, in it self altogether useless, and not to be regarded, in
respect of the Advantage the Small sword has of it, by the Dangerous Wounds it
makes, which prove, for the most part Mortal, whereas commonly the Wounds of
the Broad-sword are not so Dangerous, which in my Opinion insinuats as much, as
that a Man with a Smalsword should not stand to hazard his Receiving of a Blow
for the giving of a Thrust.

I confess I am as much convinced of the Advantage the Thrust has of the Blow
as to it is Wound, as any Man can be, as you may see in my Sc^ts Fencing-master;
but that which I condemn is that an Artest should trust to the difference of
Wounds, and so venture a Contre-temps, and not rather endeavor first to defend
himself by his Art from the Blow, and then give in his Thrust for a Man may
chance to misplant his Thrust after he has received a very severe Stroke,
perhaps near to loss of his Hand, and then I am confident, he will think it had
been better Judgment, and he would have shown more of his Art, if he had
defended first the Stroke, and then have given in his Thrust: but passing over
this,

I assure you there is no Smal-sword-man, be he never so expert, but will find
himself at a considerable Disadvantage in offering to defend a Stroke, unless
he particularly understand some thing of the defense of the Blow, or Broad
sword, and for my own part I found so great a Disadvantage in not being
acquainted with the Parrades and Blows of the Broad-sword, when I had occasion
to Play with the Fleuret against the Cudgel, (for I was once almost of this
opinion my self) that I was never at case until I found out a particular
posture for the Small-sword against the Broad; which I did, and it is also set
down in my Scots Fencing-Master, but my curiosity not resting there I resolved
to learn a little of the Broad-sword also, which I did in a very short time,
and since I find it a great deal more easy to me to defend my self either with
Broad against a Broad, or with a Small against a Broad, then I did at that
time, and the reason is, because I now know both the Parrades and Lessons
peculiar to the Broad, which before I was ignorant of, and which put me to the
trouble, as I said, of finding out a particular posture with the Smal-sword for
it, which did indeed at that time answer my design, but does so now much more,
because I understand the Art of the Broad-sword better now then I did then.

I tell you this, not out of any Vanity to commend my self, but that you may
understand what Advantage there is in being taught both Blow and Thrust, and
let any man who doubts it, and has only been taught to Thrust, and to Defend
a Thrust, make but a trial, and I am confident he will find the same difficulty
I did, and be soon of the same opinion I was when I wrote my other Book, to
which I Refer him, and of which I am still; That every Man who desires to be a
Complete Sword-man should Learn both Blow and Thrust, and unless a Man do it I
do not see how be can pretend to the Name of a Complete Sword-man, for if a Man
Understand only the Thrust and not the Blow, then he may deserve the Name of a
Complete Small-sword-man, but not of a Complete Sword-man, because he is
Ignorant of the Blow. In likemaner if a Man understand only the Blow and not
the Thrust, he may deserve the Name of a Complete Broad-sword-man, but not of a
Complete Sword-man, because he Understands not also the Thrust, so that in my
Opinion to deserve the name of a Complete Sword-man, a Man must understand both
Blow and Thrust, otherwise that Title does no ways belong to him, neither can
he with any confidence pretend to it.

But besides what I have said, there is no Sword-man will deny, but that it
sometimes so falls out when Men are Playing together, that it would be more
convenient to make a Blow then to give in a Thrust, and upon the other Hand, at
other times more convenient to give in a Thrust then to make a Blow, so that if
a Man know not how to deliver a Blow as well as a Thrust, he is upon these
occasions at a visible loss and disadvantage, whereas if he knew how to perform
both, he would always know how to behave himself according to these several
circumstances without the least confusion.

But why need I in this Place endeavor to prove the necessity of that, the
contrary whereof is condemned by the constant practice of most Nations in the
World, for do we not see the generality of the People both Gentle and Simple,
when they go to the Wars, provide themselves for the most part with
sheering-Swords, and why would they do that, if it were not out of an opinion,
that they think they may have occasion to Strike as well as to Thrust, and that
they think the Thrust alone would not be so effectual, as when it can be joined
to the blow, and that they are, being thus provided, in a better capacity to
make use of either at pleasure, and accordingly as occasion shall offer; From
all which I conclude, That there is an absolute necessity for a Man who intends
to be a complete Sword-man, to be taught and understand both Blow and Thrust,
and I think it a thing so indispensably necessary, that the learning of it by
all persons who understand it not, whether Masters or others, at all times, and
at any Age whatsoever, can no ways reflect upon their Judgment in the Art they
profess, nor be any ways derogatory from the reputation they have already had
of being good small-Sword-Men, and the like I say in behalf of the Thrust, to
those who profess only the Broad, so that I think neither of them should think
it below them to be instructed of other, in what they are ignorant of, and of
what is so useful and necessary for the complete perfecting of the Art of the
Sword, and consequently of Swordmen.

Seeing therefore (as I think I have sufficiently made appear) there is an
absolute necessity for understanding both blow and thrust to be reputed a
complete Sword-Man, I must recommend the use of the Sheering-sword, and I would
advise all without exception, who wear now only Rapiers, to wear light and
narrow Sheering-swords, at least Rapiers with good-edges, which will both
answer the design of the small-sword as to thrusting, and of the Broad as to
the blow or striking, and so put a Man in a capacity of using either as he
shall think fit, when it shall be his misfortune to be engaged, and which will
be as light and convenient to carry, as any ordinary walking-sword.

Its like the Fencing-Masters in this Kingdom may think I have gone too great a
length upon this subject, in so far as I take upon me to play the Doctor, and
offer as it were in a Magisterial way, to teach them their Duty, and also in
that I seem to tax some of them of ignorance, in not understanding the blow as
well as the thrust, because I recommend the learning of the blow to Masters, if
they be ignorant of it as well as to others.

But that they may not mistake me, I desire they would consider that this
preceding discourse (anent the abuses in Schools) does not particularly aim at
them, but at all Fencing-Masters in general, both at Home and Abroad, who are
guilty of them; and that they are really guilty of them, I appeal to all who
have frequented their Schools; therefore I expect our Masters will not take
what I have said as a particular reflection upon them, although I cannot deny
but they suffer the same abuses to be committed in their Schools; and therefore
must excuse me, if I censure them with the other Masters, until I find them
rectified.

And let them not think it will pass as a sufficient reason for them to
continue these preceding abuses in their Schools, by saying it is the custom
abroad, and that they suffer nothing to be done in their Schools, but what is
done in the Schools of other Kingdoms, and that because it is not the custom
for any Small-sword Master abroad to teach the Blow at the same time with the
Thrust, that therefore they will not do it, because they intend not to be the
first Beginners and Promoters o^ any thing which is extraordinary and out
fashion, (which to my particular knowledge (...) the chief Defense and Language
of some) this I say is but very weak reasoning, for at that rate there should
never have been any A^ or Science found out, or improven, if People had been
always restricted to the old Roo^ and Footsteps of their Predecessors, so I
expect they will either give me as strong Reasons against the Rectifying of
these abuses, (especially the teaching the Blow at the same time with the
Thrust) as I have given for them, otherwise they most pardon me to differ from
them, by recommending my own opinion which is grounded upon reason, and
condemning and Rejecting theirs at least until they produce stronger Arguments
and Reasons for it, then hitherto I have heard.

And although this indeed be my Opinion, that Ignorant Masters who understand
not the Blow, should learn it; yet it does not conclude that (...) reckon those
who profess the Art of the ^word in this Kingdom to be in that Categorie, no, I
am far from having so bad an Opinion of them, and I am apt to think the only
thing they should be condemned for, and for which I do indeed condemn them, is
not that they understand not the Blow as well as the Thrust, and therefore are
not capable to reach it (for if they denied that, they would discover too much
weakness) but that they understanding both, should teach only the one, viz. The
Thrust, and wholly neglect the other, by throwing it our of Doors, this I
confess is a neglect of such importance, and of such bad consequence, that I
neither can, nor will fore^ear the giving my earnest advice, that it, as well
as the five preceding particulars, be ^ectified, and then I am confident our
Scholars shall acquire Art inferior to none in Europe, and our Masters, by
them that repute and Esteem, which both their abilities, and they, recti^ying
of such Abuses, and Omissions, do really ^eserve.

And I likeways would not have them so Foolish as to think, that (by what I
have bee^ saying in Reference to the teaching both Blow and Thrust) I design to
recommend any Particular Master before another, no, I am not (...) mean as to
have any such Particular by-end my design is so far from that, that it is
altogether general, and merely for the A^vantage of the Art, and to Complete
Swordmen; for if Masters cannot by the Art, Care, and Pains they take,
recommend themselves t^ Scholars, they shall never have any from me, because I
think all Masters should be (...) puted, and had in Esteem, only for the^
distinct and accurate method of teaching, and for the pains they take to cause
their Scholla^ understand, and comprehend what they a^ Learning, and not for
any recommendatio^ they can get from any Particular Person what somever, and
therefore if they expect any particular recommendation from me, they a^ hugely
deceived, for I wish them all alike well that is to have Flourishing Schools,
and E^pert Scholars, to testify that they are Master indeed, and not
Bunglers, of which there a^ but too many.

The next thing I observe, is, that if all I ha^ said be duly and exactly put
in practice, (...) will infallibly make a Man a true Artist, an^ if he be
truly an Artist, his having Art wi^ increase his boldness and courage, and put
him in a capacity, not only to preserve his Life and Honor, but also to force
as it were a respect and esteem to himself, from those, who although they
undervalue his Art, yet darr not be so bold (least he should make them smart
for it) as publicly to own it, but are rather satisfied by their silence to
acknowledge his dexterity, and that he is to be commended for the pains, and
labor, he has taken to acquire so gentile and useful an Art.

But suppose they should openly reflect upon him, and undervalue his Art, by
threatening him with that unanswerable defense, as they think of their
Ignorance, and infallible Defeater of all Art (I mean by engaging him to fight
with Pistol, or other such like Fireweapons) and indeed to hear some People
talk, one would think that by their gaming this one point, of engaging a
Sword-man to sight with Fire-armes, they make no doubt, but all will go well
with them, and that the day is certainly their own, it being a kind of Proverb
amongst them. Is such a Person a Sword-man, if it be answered, Yes, then reply
they after a mocking manner; What does it signisie? If I were to engage with
him, I could soon make his Art of little use to him; I would take a Pist^l^
him, and then I pray you where is all his Art of Defense, I believe he will
hardly parie a Pistol Ball with it. Such discourse as this is but too common
amongst Ignorants, and they think when they talk at this rate, they have found
the Philosopher stone, which in place of turning every thing into Gold, can
turn all their Ignorance into the profoundest Art and Skill, and all skilful
Persons, Art, and Judgment into the greatest Ignorance; so that in their
opinion, Artists can reap no advantage by what they understand, and themselves
can reap all, because they understand nothing.

But alas poor Ignorants! Their Folly in this is as discernable, as their
Ignorance in the former; and they can pretend to have no more Advantage over a
Sword-man, by engaging him to make use of a Pistol, then the Swordman can
pretend to have over them, which I shall endeavor to prove by what follows.

Although then I confess, that there is properly no Defensive part in using of
Pistols, either a Foot or upon Horseback, but what all Men are alike Master
of, I mean to receive the shot, and take their hazard of being hit or mist; for
no Man will be so foolish, as to pretend to parie the shot of a Pistol; yet
there, are some methods, which I think not fit at present to mention, that may
be used to shun a shot, the which who can neatly make use of them, will
certainly have an advantage of those who understand them not, but set
themselves up like an immovable stock or post, to be shot at.

But supposing all Men alike dextrous as to this point, that is to know no
means of a^oiding, but merely to take their hazard of being hit or not; yet I
say, in the Offensive part, there may be a vast Advantage acquired; for
whosoever will according to the advice in my Scots Fencing-master, accustom
himself to shot at a Mark, both a Foot and on Horseback, will, when he is
necessitate to use it in earnest, have almost as considerable advantage over
his Adversary in knowing to adjust his shot, (supposing his Adversary to be
ignorant and not to have practiced to adjust his) as he would have had a Foot
in adjusting his Thrust, his Adversary being likewise ignorant of the Art of
the Sword; so that if this Person of whom I am discoursing, and who boasts so
much of the Advantage he will have by using Pistols, has but as little of the
practice of shooting, as he has of Thrusting, he can then in Reason pretend to
no more Advantage by using the Pi^ol, then the Artist can, except what mere
Chance and Fortune gives him, which is far from any ground of certainty.

Therefore, I say, he only will probably have the Advantage with Pistol, who
has frequented most the shooting at a Mark, and if neither of them have done
that, then none of them can pretend to any visible Advantage over the other;
but what, as I said, is merely casual and by chance. But I confess, if the
Ignorant be better skilled in shooting then the Artist, in that case he has an
Advantage; and I can see no Reason why the Artist should more answer the
Challenge with Pistols, seeing he is a better Marks-Man then the Artist, then he
would answer the Artist with Swords, because the Artist was the most Adroit at
thrusting; So that the only way to end this Debate, is, that they either fight
with Weapons altogether unknown to both, or otherwise do as one of those two
Men, who after they had quarrelled, lest the one should have had any Advantage
by Art in the Weapons which might have been made use of, did propose a Barrel
of Gunpowder should be brought to each, in the middle of which, they were to
place themselves, and then with fired Matches to try who could most Manfully,
or I may rather say Madly, blow up other. And I know no other way but this to
decide the Quarrel: For if a Man refuse to fight me with a Sword, because he
thinks I am a better Sword-man than he, I must certainly be a great Fool, if
I fight him with a Pistol, because he proposes it as a particular Advantage to
himself:

I know it will be Answered to this, That it is the custom for those who
receive the Challenge, to choose the Weapons, and so that will end the Debate,
because who ever gives the Challenge, is in Honor obliged to Answer the other
with whatever Weapons he shall propose.

I confess it is so, and I think it most reasonable when a Man is forced to
fight, that he should have the choice of what Weapon he will venture his Life
with; But what I was saying, concerns only such, for some, who after they have
given a Challenge, and their Antagonist received it, and appointed Swords to be
their Weapons, they afterward getting notice that he is a Sword-man, cunningly
decline the fighting him with that Weapon, and propose Pistols, because of the
inequality there would be in making use of Swords. Now I say, when a Sword-man
rancounters with such a Person as this, who first gives him a Challenge, and
then afterward declines to fight him with the Weapons he proposed, I see, I
say, no reason why he should more answer him with Pistols, seeing he proposed it
for a particular Advantage, then the other did him with Swords, because he
judged it would prove to his disadvantage; for if the Refusal reflect upon any
of the two, it must be certainly upon him who gave the Challenge; Because,
although he was so stout as to Appeal, yet had not the Courage to Answer the
other with the Weapons he proposed; Therefore I conclude, That a man had far
better forbear a Challenge, then decline the Weapons after they are chosen.

But, There is in my humble Opinion, no better way to take away all such
Debates, then to live soberly and peaceably, according to the Doctrine and
Precepts of that Religion which we profess, and then we shall make use of all
those Arts, more for divertisement to ourselves, then prejudice to our
Neighbors.

Now after what I have said, let any considering Person judge, if an ignorant,
by engaging a Sword-man to fight with a Pistol, has got so great an Advantage,
as to be any ways a ground of railing at, mocking, or turning into Ridicule
the Art of the Sword, no certainly, he has got none, but what the Artist may
likewise pretend to as well as he; and therefore I would advise such Persons
rather to betake themselves to the practice of Fencing, and Shoteing, that so
their Advantage may be grounded and depend upon their Art, and not upon such
Fancies and Notions, which, if real, are casual; but for the most part, prove
Chimerical, and have only their existence in their ^gnorant Brains; but are
below the being regarded, or taken notice of by any Gentleman or Judicious
Person, who should ground his thoughts upon Reason, and not in the Air; that if
they be examined they may prove so^id and durable as Reason, and not volatile
and changeable, as the Aerial Foundation upon which they are built, and so
discover the Weakness and Ignorance of their first Promoter and Author; But not
to insist longer upon this,

I observe in the fourth and last place, that although all I have said in
commendation of Fencing, were but Stories and Lies, and the vain imaginations
of a Hypocondriack -- brain, yet all Gentlemen should practice it, and have an
esteem for it, if it were for no other reason but this, that it is a most
pleasant divertisement, and an innocent, Healthful, and Manly Recreation and
Exercise for the Body, and although a Man could reap no Advantage by it for the
Defense of his Body; yet that its very keeping a Man's joints and members nimble
and cleaver, and in a ready trime, as it were, for any other Divertisement or
Exercise, as Ten^ice, Dancing, Riding, etc. should make it Esteemed and
Practiced by all who are above the rank of Clowns.

For to use the words of a Wiseman, The understanding of this Noble and Useful
Art, is a Quality and Perfection, hardly attainable by those who hold the
Plough, and glory in the Goad; who drive Oxen, and are occupied in their
Labors, and whose talk is of their Bullocks, who give their mind to make
Furrows; and are diligent to give the Kine fodder. No, it agrees not with the
Nature of such; neither is it for the Smith who sits by the Anvil, and
considers the Iron work, the vapor of the Fire, wastes his Flesh, and he
figheth with the heat of the Furnace; the noise of the Hammer and Anvil is ever
in his Ears, and his Eyes look still upon the Pattern of the thing he makes.
Such vulgar and undisciplined Minds as those, are not ordinarily capable to
conceive the Intricacies, and Excellencies, of this most Gentile and
Gentle-manny Art.

And although it cannot be denied, but some mean kind of People profess,
practice and take delight in it; yet those are Men who are more refined in
their Judgments and Inclinations, then the generality of the Vulgar are, and
who by the same gentile Inclination they have to follow the Sword, discover
that there is in them something more then ordinary, and that they aim at
somewhat, above what either their Birth or Education could really make them
pretend to; so that I make no ^oubt, but if such Persons had either really
^een, or had had the Education peculiar to Gentlemen, they would have been in
a fitter ^pacity both to have improven themselves, and better instructed others
in that Art, for which they have such a respect and liking.

And if this which I say hold true, then no ^oubt but the understanding of this
Art, be^ngeth in a more particular manner to Gentlemen, or those who are called
Les Hommes (...) espee, then to any other; and therefore it is any advice, and
I earnestly recommend it (...) such, not to ungentleman themselves by the
^eglect and contempt of an Art, which as I ^ave made appear, is so peculiar to,
and I ^ay say inseparable from the Name and ^haracter they bear.

An Art so Noble, Useful, and Gentile,
To speak its praises, would a Volume fill;
For when that I, its Merits would display,
My Mouth is stopped, my Muse is at a stay.
It so exceeds all that I can conceive,
I Am forced to silence, yet to speak must crave;
But seeing all I can express and show,
Would far come short, of what is its real due,
I shall be short, and (...) of it say,
It is a Badge, Accomplishment, and Ray,
Which does adorn all who to understand
Its real Use and Worth, do take in hand.
An Art so useful, that no Gentleman,
Of Valor, Honor, be without it can,
For it to all who carry Sword by side,
Should be a Pilot, and a constant Guide;
Unless they do renounce the Name they bear,
And that which them from others Character:
For my part, I confess I it esteem,
And for my trusty Safeguard do it deem,
And always will, knowing it never deceives,
Any who to it trust and respect gives;
But believe me who despise it wholly,
Ignorance betray, as well as Folly,
And will repent them (when it is too late)
They trusted none to it, so much, to Fate.
I confess I am neither Poet nor Versificator, yet those Lines offering to my
Fancy, and relating to the Subject, I thought fit to set them down; if they are
good its by chance, if not, pass them over; I wrote them for my divertisement,
and its like had it not been to divert me, I had not taken the pains to write
so much either of Fencing, or in Commendation of it as I have done; However
what I have Writ, I recommend to your perusal, which I think can hardly be
refused, seeing it cost me a great deal of more pains in Writting, then it will
do you in Reading; and if you despise my offer, I assure you, I shall take it
so ill, and be so much concerned, that I shall never sleep a whit the worse for
it.

But that I may draw to a close, if any who shall peruse this Discourse, do not
understand the Terms of Art herein mentioned, such as
Contre-caveating-Parrades, Contre-temps, Flanca^ude, Voult-coupee, etc. They
may have Recourse to my Book of Fencing, Entitled, The Scots Fencing-Master,
where they will find all these Terms and Lessons explained to the full.

And that I may end as I began, I earnestly entreat and desire, that with
Calmness, and a Vigorous Judgment, you would seriously reflect upon, and
consider what I have said, before you pass your Verdict and Opinion, and then
(...) doubt not, but it shall jump very near with ^y own, which is what I
expected and wish^d for.

ADIEU.
FINIS.
