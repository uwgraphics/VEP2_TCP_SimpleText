Christ's Kirk on the Green. Composed (as is supposed) by King James V. Newly
Corrected according to the Original Copy.
WAs never in Scotland heatd nor seen
such dancing and decay;
Neither at Faulkland on the Green,
nor Peebles at the play,
As was of Wooers as I ween
at Christ's Kirk on a day:
For there came Kittie washen clean
with her new Gown of Gray.
Full gay that day.
To dance these Damsels them ^ight,
these Lasses light of laits,
Their Gloves were of the Raffal right,
their Shoes were of the Straits;
Their Kirtles were of Lincoln light
well dressed with many plaits,
They were so nice when men them neigh'd
they squiel'd like any Gaits
Full loud that day
Of all these Maidens mild as meed,
was none so gimp as Gillie:
As any Rose her rude was red,
her Lire was like the Lilly,
But yellow, yellow was her Head,
and she of Love so silly
Though all her Kin had sworn her dead
she would have none but Willie
Alone that day
She scorned Jack, and scripp'd at him,
and ^^^geon'd him with mocks:
He would have love her, she would not let him
for all his yellow locks*
He che^sh^ her, she bad go chat him,
she counted him not two clocks:
So shamefully his short Ja^k let him,
his Legs were like ^w^ Rocks,
O* Rung^ that day.
Tom Lutter was their Minstre^ meet,
good Lord, how he could ^ance:
He played so shril, and sang so sweet
while Tousie took a Trance,
Old Lightfoot there he could foreleet
and counterfitted France:
He held him like a Man discreet,
and up the Morice dance.
He took that day.
Then Stephen came stepping in with stends,
no ri^k might him arrest,
Splay-foot did bob with many bends,
for Masie he made request.
He lap while he lay on his lends;
and rising was so preast,
While he did host at both the ends
for honor of the Feast,
and danced that day.
Then Robin Roy began to revel,
and Tousie to him drugged:
Let be quoth Jack, and called him jevel,
and by the Taill him rugged.
Then Kensie clicked to a Kevel,
God wots as they two lugged,
They parted there upon a Nevel,
men say their Hair was rugged
Between them two
With that a friend of his cried fie,
and forth an Arrow drew.
He forged it so forcefully,
the Bow in slenders flew,
Such was the Grace of God, trow I,
for had the Tree been true:
Men said, who know his Archery,
that he had slain anew,
Belyve that day.
A yap young man that stood him neist,
soon bent his Bow in ire.
And etled the Bairn in at the Breast:
the Bolt flew over the Bire:
And cried fie, he has slain a Priest
a Mile beyond the Mire:
Both Bow and Bag from him he keist
and fled as fast as Fire
From Flint that day
An hasty Kins-man called Hary
that was an Archer keen,
Tied up a Tackle without tarry,
I trow the man was teen:
I wot not whether his hand did vary
or his Foe was his Friend:
But he espayr by the mights of Mary
as one that nothing mean'd
But good that day,
Then Lawrie like a Lion lap.
and soon a flain could fedder,
He height to pierce him at the Pape,
thereon to wed a Wedder
He hit him on the wamb a wap,
it butt like any Bladder.
He escaped so, such was his hap;
his Doublet was of Leather,
Full fine that day.
The buff so boisteriously abaist him.
that he to the Earth dusht down.
The other Man for dead he left him,
and fled out of the Town
The Wives came forth, and up they reft him
and found life in the Lown.
Then with three rou^s there they raised him
and cured him out of sown,
Frae hand that day
The Miller was of a manly make.
to meet with him it was no mowes:
There durst not ten some there him take
so cowed he their powes:
The bushment whole about him brake,
and bickered him with bows.
Then traitorously behind his back.
they hoch'd him on the howes
Behind that day.
Then Hutchen with a Hazel rice
to red began through them rummil:
He muddl'd them down like any Mice,
he was no betty bummil.
Though he was wight he was not wise,
with such jutors to jummil.
For from his Thumb there flew a slice
while he cried barlafummil.
I Am slain this day.
When that he saw his Blood was red
to flee might no man let him:
He trou'd it had been for old feed;
he thought and bade have at him.
He made his Feet defend his Head,
the far fairer it set him:
While he was past out of their plead:
they must be swift that gat him.
Through speed that day.
Two that were headsmen of the herd,
they rusht on other like Rams;
The other four which were untear'd
beat on with Barrow Trams,
And where their Gobs were ungear'd,
they got upon the G^ms,
While that all bloody was their Beards.
as they had worried Lambs,
Most like that day;
They girn'd and glowred all at anes,
each gossip other grieved:
Some striked stings, some gathered stanes,
some fled, and some relieved,
The Minstrel used quiet means,
that day he wisely prieved,
For he came hame with unbruis'd Banes
where fighters were mischieved,
Full ill that day.
With Forks and Flails they lent them steps,
and flew together like frigs:
With bougers of Barns they pierced blew caps
and of their bairns made Brig^
The rare rose rudely with their raps,
then Rungs were laid on Rigs:
The Wives came forth with cries and claps,
see where my likeing ligs,
Full low this day.
The black Souter of Braith was bowden,
his Wife hang at his Waist:
His Body was in black all browden;
he girned like a Ghaist,
Her glittering hair was so bowden,
her love fast from him laist,
That for his sake she was unyawden
while he a mile was chaste,
And mair that day.
When they had beir'd like baited Bulls,
the bone fires burnt like bails,
Then they grew as meek as Mules
that wearied were with mails,
For those forfoughten tired fools
fell down like slaughtered Frails,
Fresh men came in and hailed the Dools,
and dang them down in dails,
Bedeen that da^
The Wives then gave a hideous yell,
when all these yonkiers yoked,
At fierce as flags of Fire flaughts fell,
f^icks to the field they flocked,
The Carles with Clubs did others quel
on breast while blood out boaked,
So rudely rang the common Bell,
that all the Steeple rocked,
For dread that day.
By this Tom Tailer was in his gear,
when he heard the common Bell,
He said he should make all on stear,
when he came there himsel,
He went to fight with such a fear,
while to the Ground he fell,
A Wife that hit him on the Ear
with a great knocking Mell,
Feld him that day.
The Bridegroom brought a Pint of Ale,
and bad the Piper drink it,
Drink it, quoth he, and it so stail,
ashrew me if I think it.
The Bride her Maidens stood near by,
and said it was not blinked,
And Bartagesie the Bride so gay,
upon him fast she winked,
Full soon that day:
When all was done, Dick with an Ax
came forth to fell a Fother,
Quoth he, where are you whoreson smaiks;
right now that hurt my Brother,
His Wife bade him, go hame, Gib-Glaiks,
and so did Meg his Mother,
He turned and gave them both their palks
for he durst ding no other,
But them that day
FINIS.
The Banishment of Poverty by J.D. of Albany:
To the Tune of the Last Good Night.
POx fa that pultran Poverty,
Wae worth the time that I him saw
Since first he laid his Fang on me
My self from him I dought never draw:
his wink to me has been a Law,
He haunts me like a penny dog,
Of him I stand far greater aw
Than Pupil does of Pedagogue.
The first time that he met with me,
Was at a Cl^chan in the West,
Its name I trow Kilbareban be;
Where Habies Drons gave many a blast.
There we shook hands, called be his cast,
An ill dead may that Custron die:
For there he gripped me right fast
When first I fell in Cautionrie.
But yet in hopes to be relieved,
And freed from that foul Ladlie Lown,
Fernier when Whigs were ill mischiv'd
And forced to fling their Weapons down
When we chased them from Glasgew Town,
I with that Swinger thought to grapple,
But when Indemnity came down,
The Laydron caught me by the Thr^ple.
But yet in hopes of more relief,
A race I made to Arinfrew.
Where they did bravely buff my Beef,
And made my Body Black and Blew.
At Justice Court I them pursued,
Expecting help for their Reproof,
Indemnity thought nothing due,
The De^vil a farthing for my Loof.
But wishing that I might ride East,
To trot on Foot I soon would tire,
My Page allowed me not a Beast,
I wanted Gi^t to pay the Hyre:
He and I lap over many a Sire,
I heuked him at Calder cult.
But long ere I came to Clypes-myre
The ragged Rogue caught me a while.
By ^oland Bush and Bridge of Bonny
We bickered down toward Bankier,
We feared u^ Revers for our Money,
Nor whi^ly whaes to grip our Gear*
My tattered Tutor took no Fear,
(Though he did travel in the Mirk)
But thought it fit when he drew near
To filsh a Forage at Falkirk.
No Man would open me the Door,
Because my Comerade stood by,
They dread full ill I was right poor
By my forsaken Company.
But Cunninghame soon me espied,
By how and hair he hailed me in.
And swore we should not part so dry,
Though I were stripped to the Skin.
I baid all night but long ere day,
My cursed companion bade me rise,
I start up soon and took the way,
He needed not to bid me twice.
But what to do I did advise,
In Lithg^w I might not sit down,
On a Scots Groat we ba^^ed thrice;
And in at night to Edinburgh Town.
We held the Long gate to Leith Wind,
Where poorest Purses use to be,
And in the Caltoun judged syne,
Fit Quarters for such Company.
Yet ^ the High-Town fain would see,
But that my Comrad did me discharge,
He would me Blak^^ns Ale to p^i^,
And must my ^eard that was right large,
The morn I ventured up the Wind,
And sloug'd in at the Neather-Bow,
Thinking that Trooker for to tyne,
Who does me Damnage what he dow:
His company he does bestow
On me to my great grief and Pain,
Ere I the Throng could wrestle throw
The Lown was at my Heels again.
I green'd to gang on the Plain-stanes,
To see if Comrades would me ken;
We two ga^d pacing there our laines
The hungery Howr^ ^wixt twelve and One,
Then I knew no way how to ^en,
My Guts ruml'd like a Hurle-borrow,
I dined with Saints and Noble Men,
Even sweet St. Giels and Earl of Murray;
Tykes Testment take them for their Treat,
For I needed not my Teeth to pick,
Though I was in a cruel Sweat,
He set not by say what I like.
I called him Turk and traked Tyke;
And wearied him with many a Curse,
My Banes were hard like a Stane-Dyke
No Rig Maria was in my Purse:
Kind Widow Caddel sent for me
To dine, as she did often forsooth,
But oh alas that might not be!
For her House was too near the Tolbooth;
Yet God reward her for her Love,
And kindness which I feckful sound,
Most ready still for my behove
Ere that Hells Hound took her in Hand.
I slipped my Page and stour'd to Leith
To try my Credit at the Wine
But foul a drible fyl'd my Teeth,
He caught me at the Coffee Sign
I staw down through the Neather-Wyne,
My Lady Semples House was near,
To enter there was my design
Where Poverty durst never appear.
I dined there, but I baid not long,
My Lady fain would shelter me,
But oh alas! I needs must gang
And leave that comely Company.
Her Lad convoyed me with her Key
Out through the Garden to the Fields,
Ere I the Links could graithly see
My Governor was at my Heels.
I dought not dance to Pipe nor Mary
I had no stock for Cards nor Dice,
But I sure to Sir William Sharp
Who never made his counsel nice*
That little man he is right wise
And sharp as any Brier can be;
He bravely gave me his advice
How I might Poison Poverty.
Quoth he there grovvs hard by the Dial
In Hattons Garden bright and sheen
a sovereign Herb, called Penny Royal
Which all the year grovvs fresh and green.
Could you but gather it fair and clean,
Your Business would not go backwards,
But let account of it be seen
To the Physicians of Exchequer.
Or if their Ticket ye bring with you
Come unto me, ye need not fear
For I some of that Herb can give you
Which I have planted this same Year.
It will cause your Page disappear
Who vvait, on you against your will;
To gather it I shall you lear
In my own Yards of Stony-hill,
But when I dread that would not work
I over thought me of a Wile
How I might at my leisure lurk
My Graceless Guardian to beguil.
It Is but my galloping a Mile
Through Cannongate with little loss,
Till I have Sanctuary a while
Within the Girth of Abbey Closs.
There I won in and blyth was I
When to the Inner-Court I drevv,
My Governor I did defy,
For joy I clapped my Wings and crew*
There Messengers dare not pursue,
Nor with their Wands Men's Shoulders flee^*
There dvvels distressed Lairds anue
In peace tho they have little Gear:
I had not tarried an Hour or two,
When my blessed Fortune was to see
A sight sure by the mights of Mary
Of that brave Duke of Albany.
Where one blink of his Princly Eye
Put that son* Foundring to the flight,
Frae me he banished Poverty
And made him take his last Goodnight*
FINIS.
