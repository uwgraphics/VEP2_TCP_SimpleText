The Loyal Protestants ASSOCIATION.
WHereas several Printed Forms of Petitions have been lately dispersed up and
down the Kingdom, to procure Subscriptions: And whereas the Proceedings
thereupon have been adjudged, and Declared, by his Majesty, and his Right
Honorable Privy Counsel, to be Contrary to Law, and tending to the raising of
Sedition, and Treason: The said Petitions being still carried on in a private
way, by Obscure and Ill-affected persons, as the Act, and sense of the
Generality of the City, and Nation; to the Scandal of his Majesty's Loyal, and
Protestant Subjects, and all true Lovers of their Prince and Country.

We whose Names are here under Subscribed, out of a sense of our Duty both to
Church and State, and to Witness our detestation of all Illegal, and
Vndutyfull practices, do hereby unanimously declare unto the World, that we
abhor the thought of any such Confederacy, and that we will have nothing to do
in the Agitating, Promoting or Subscribing of any such Petition as aforesaid,
in Opposition to his Majesty's Royal Will and Proclamation.
