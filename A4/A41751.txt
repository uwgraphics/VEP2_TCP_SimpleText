FOR My FRIENDS.
My Friends,
THE Idea of Friendship, we al know, is not less Beautiful, and Pleasing, than
Commun: Who so morose, so rude, so selfish, so base-minded, but would fain be,
if not really, yet in vulgar estimation, eminent both for Active, and Passive
Friendship? Do not the most of men, make it their main study, and labor, how
they may acquire friends; and appear to be such to those, whom they would make
such to themselves? Ask the poor blind Philosophers, and they will tell you, what
an incomparable Jewel a true Friend is. So universally received, so delicious,
and ravishing, is the Notion of Friendship. And yet, Friends, I must inform
you, that albeit the Notion of Friendship be so commun, and pleasing; yet the
Thing it self, is as rare, and displeasing to this narrow-spirited, selfish
Age. Aristotle was so sensible of the paucitie true friends, that he cries out,
(...), O friends! there is no friend.
Oh! what a doleful and sad contemplation is it, to an Ingenuous, and Noble,
(not to add a Christian) Spirit; to consider, among the crowd of men, whosoever
much affect, profess, and glory in this style, of being Your Friend, how few
there are, who affect, yea, who do not in Truth contradict, the Thing it self?
Do not most pretenders to friendship toward you, appear to be, at last,
friends to none but themselves? Alas! If the Notion of Friendship be so sweet,
and rare; then how much more sweet, and rare is the Thing it self? He must
needs be much Alienated from Human Nature, who is not wel-pleased with the
Name; and yet how few are experimentally acquainted with the Thing? The Design
therefore of this following Discourse, is, to Revive the true Idea, and
Character of Friendship, both Human and Divine; which seems much obliterated,
and defaced, in these Last Times of Apostasy.

I have been, My Friends, long meditating, how I might best express my Love to
your Souls: And, after serious Inquisition, I cannot find out a more effectual.
Expedient than this, to acquaint you with, and press you unto, Divine Amity
with God in Christ; which is the only solid, and substantial Foundation, for
Amity among our selves: For if we are not Friends of Christ, we shall not be
Good, or Long friends each with other. Wherefore, my main work lies here, to
corroborate, and fortify the great Essentials, and Vitals of friendship with
Christ; and then our Friendship among our selves will follow, as Light does the
Sun, Heat Fire, and the Shadow the Body. For it is, to me, an Experiment, or
Observation, clothed with eternal Truth, that nothing has a more efficacious,
and soverain Influence, for the Production, Conservation, and Improvement of
mutual friendship among Christians, as Christians; yea, among men, as men,
under al Relations, than wel-grounded, and Growing Friendship with Christ;
which is the first, original, Universal Idea, or most perfect Exemplar of al
other true Friendship. And, without al peradventure, were Christians but better
friends of Christ, they would be better friends among themselves. Whence arise
those envenimed Spirits, those proud Animosities, those vexatious Heats, and
needless Controversies, among the professing friends of Christ; but from some
very great gradual, if not essential, defect in that Friendship they profess
toward Christ? Does not Christ make this an essential character of his
friends, that they love each other, Joh. 15.12, 17? Is not then the defect of
Love, and Friendship among Christians, a black Marque of some defect in our
Friendship toward Christ? And is there any more effectual course to be taken,
for the Repairment, and Restoration of the primitive love, and friendship
among Christians, than the Restoration, and Repairment of their languid, dying
Love, and Friendship toward Christ? Such an intimate, essential Connection
with, yea, causal Dependence on friendship with Christ, has Christian
friendship among our selves, both in its first Production, and Improvement.

Having, My Friends, given you my design, I must a little acquaint you, with
the Material parts, and Accidents of the following Discourse. Finding my self
under a deep sense, of many intrinseck, and essential Obligations, some
natural, some civil, some Christian, and some mixed of some, or al of these;
which have brought me under many particular Laws, and Offices of Christian
friendship toward you; I have, for the discharge of the same, endeavored to
comprehend, under some one or the other Head, al your Cases, and Conditions: and
O that you would al take your portion!

1. Some of you are my Friends by Blood, and Nature; For my Friend's by blood
only.
and O that I could say, we were al such by Grace, and the Blood of Christ
also! But, Ah! Alas! I fear, some of you, who are Dear, yea very Dear friends
to me by Blood, are yet Enemies to Christ. And, albeit I am not arrived to that
mesure of Pure zele, as to say, with Paul, Romans 9.3. I could wish my self were
accursed from Christ, for my Brethren, my Kinsmen according to the Flesh; Yet,
I hope, I may, in some poor mesure, without vanity say, in the foregoing words
of Paul, v. 2. That I have great heavines, and continual sorrow in mine heart
for you, to consider, that any of us, who are tied together by such a natural
Bond of friendship founded in Blood. should be eternally rent, and separated
each from other. If there were any place for sorrow and grief in Heaven, how
much of it would be found in the hearts of glorified Saints, to think, that
while they are there bathing their hearts, in the soul-satisfying river of
Life, part of their own flesh and blood, should be frying, and boiling in the
flames of Hell? O that I could prevail upon you, who are so near to me by blood
(and yet, as I fear, too many of you, far from Christ) seriously to consider,
the weight of those Arguments offered to you; in the following Treatise, for
Friendship with Christ! What is it, you mostly Intend, or aim at? Would you
fain preserve your Names, Families, and Repute, from being buried in the Grave
of Oblivion, Disgrace, and Reproach? I do not condemn your endeavor hereof,
provided that it be in Subordination to the Name, and Interest of your Lord;
and in Subjection to his Soverain will, and Pleasure: But yet remember, I pray
you, (1.) That a Name, is but a Name, when al is done, and therefore but (...).
Democrit.
a Shadow of a Thing: (2.) That a Good Name is, by Universal Consent, but the
Shadow, or Reflection of Virtue. And what greater Virtue can there be than the
Election of Christ for your friend? What are a thousand Names, or Titles of
Honor without Christ, but as so many Ciphers without a figure? You know, that
ten or twenty Ciphers, if they stand alone, without a Figure precedent,
signify nothing: but prefixe a figure before them, and then each Cipher is
very significant. And, is it not just so with all Names, and Titles of Honor?
Are they any more, in themselves, than mere Ciphers? But place Christ before
them, and then, O! how significant is every Name or Title of Honor? How many
10000, or 100000 of Honors follow? Yea, (3.) Can there be a greater piece of
Honor, and Renown than this, to let your Names, and Honors rot in the dust for
the Name of Christ? Surely, the best way to preserve your Name, is to Sacrifice
it to Christ, and his Service. O that you had 100000 Names, and Dignities to
part with for Christ, and his Service! What the Honor of Christ's friends is,
you will see p. 163. of this Discourse. Or, is it Riches, Pleasures, Beauty, or
Liberty you aim at? Surely, these you will find no where so pure, so sweet, so
satisfying, as in friendship with Christ, as Chap. 6. And if these taking,
alluring Arguments will not prevail with you, to make Christ your friend; then
read, I beseech you, the Black Marquis, and Curses, which remain on Open, or
Secret Enemies of Christ, Chap. 8. But if you are in any mesure inclined to
make Christ your friend, then for farther Inducements, and Directions, view
Chap. 9.

As for you, My Friends, For my friends by civil contract.
who are such, on any civil account, or Relation, contracted by Education, or
conversation; if you yet remain strangers to Christ, my Desires, and Advice to
you, are the same with what precedes to my Friends, and Relations by Blood.

But as for you, My Friends, For my Friends in Christ, or by Nature, and in
Christ both.
who are so by Grace, though not by Nature; or by Grace, and Nature both, I
shall, because I know I may, use much freedom with you. I have ever had, since
I understood what Friendship means, great estime of it; though I am sensible of
great defects therein, both toward Christ and you. And that which makes me the
more to value your friendship is, many spiritual Advantages, especially, the
Benefit of your Prayers; which, I am very apt to persuade my self, I receive
thereby. And the Reflection on, or contemplation of those many weighty
Obligations, and Engagements I lie under, in reference to you, was a great
motive to engage my pen, in this Vndertakement before you. I must confess, I
have been formerly, and still am in part, much dissatified in the commun Humor,
or Itch of writing Books; especially, unless there be something more than
ordinary to be found in them: But yet considering, that Books are valued, and
read by friends, not only for their own intrinseck value; but also according to
the Estime, and Affection we have of the Author, this gave me some hopes, that
these my Desires, and Labors, though never so mean and contemtible in
themselves, as also in the estime of Athenian Wits, might be of some Use to
you, for your soul's good.

And I am farther to inform you, My dear Friends, that when I entered on this
Vndertakement, my first Intention was, only to give you some familiar and brief
Manual, or Directorie, for your Instruction, in What Christ expects from his
friends, in a way of Duty; and what they may expect from him, in a way of
gracious privilege, and Vouchsafement: What ought to be the postures of your
hearts toward Christ; and what are the postures of Christ's heart toward you:
How you may walk with Christ; and how Christ will walk with you, in all ways of
friendship, and Communion. This, I say, was my first Intention, when I first
undertook this Discourse. Which indeed takes in the sum of my practick
Divinity, and which I intended to give you, with as much Perspicuitie,
Brevitie, and Familiarity, as I might. But, Lo! I had no sooner entered into
that spacious field of Emmanuel's Land, and there received some glimmering
prospect, of those heart-ravishing Beauties, and incomparable Perfections,
which render him so much eligible, and amiable for himself, but I soon lost my
self, and my first Intention in those Thickets. I was, as the wandering Be, so
taken with the fragrant flours, that grow in this Emmanuel's garden; as that I
could not refrain wandering from flour to flour, til I had gathered some sweet
honey from each.

And this, My Friends, gives you the Reason why the explicatorie part of this
First Book, which I intended to comprise in one Section, or Chapter at most, is
run up to such a Bulk, and takes not in, as I guess, the fourth part of the
first fundamental Law of friendship with Christ. And albeit it may seem to some
too offensive, to others too uncouth and difficult, to others too digressive,
to others too artificial; yet I must tell you, that I repent not of my Labors
herein. O happy Digression, that meets with so good a friend! O Blessed Art,
that serves to adorn the Lord of Glory!

First, I am not ignorant, that this Discourse will seem offensive to many
Curious, Athenian wits; who may, peradventure, out of curiosity look into it,
but after a taste of my Design, will treat it as the Athenians did Paul's
Discourse, Act. 17.18. What will this Babbler say? etc. To talk of Christ's being
eligible for himself; and that he ought to be elected as such by his friends,
is a Mystery too great for the wisdom of this world to comprehend: and
therefore no wonder, if many lascivious wits snarle, and carpe at such
Discourses. But I neither regard, nor fear their cavils: I bless the Lord, I
have this witness in my self, that, what I write, is Truth; yea, a Truth
necessary to be inculcated, in these Wanton, Backsliding days. And though I
shall not undertake to vindicate every expression, yet I no way dout, but, with
the Lord's Assistance, to maintain the substance of this Discourse, and each
part thereof; and that both by Scriptural, and Rational Argument. I have
studiously avoided Controversies; because my subject is Love, and friendship:
neither would I have a Controversy with any, but such as have some fundamental
controversy with my Lord. You will find here nothing dissonant to the Doctrine
of the Church of England, as stated by our first Reformers, and Sealed by many
of them, with their Blood. Yet I pretend not to be Infallible, and therefore if
any serious person, shall declare his dissent, against any thing dropped from my
Pen, I hope, I shall be willing to be better informed; and though he may find me
in an error, he shall not leave me in obstinacy.

But to return to you, My Christian friends, for whom I am more nearly
concerned, and, in a mesure, afflicted for some of you, who are good friends of
Christ, and yet may, peradventure, find some Disappointment, if not occasion of
spiritual trouble, from this Treatise, and that both as to Matter and Form.
First, as to its Matter, you may, perhaps, find something above your
Intellectual capacity to apprehend; and others above your Moral, or Gracious
capacity to practice. 1. As for such Notions, you may here meet with, above
your Apprehensive capacity; you may be pleased to consider. (1.) That these
Notions here explicated, are not mere, idle, fruitless speculations; but
Scriptural Mysteries, such as are full of spiritual sap, and juice; and have a
mighty efficacious Influence on our walking with God, as our friend. (2.) If
your capacity be too short to wade through, or fadome the Depths of these
Divine Mysteries; yet remember, it is worth your while to stand on the banks of
this bottomless Ocean, and cry out with Paul, Romans 11.33. O the Depth of the
riches, both of the wisdom, and knowledge of God! If we can comprehend, or
apprehend but a little of such Transcendent mysteries, it is of great moment.
(3.) Remember also that Paul, Romans 1.14. counted himself a debtor to the wise,
as well as to the unwise. (4.) Though in the explication of some great
Scriptural Mysteries, I have gone, perhaps, beyond ordinary capacities, yet I
have in other parts, especially in the application, endeavored to condescend to
vulgar capacities.

2. As for such Truths as may seem to be above your moral, or gracious
capacity, in point of practice, particularly that of electing Christ for
himself, and the like; be pleased to take notice. (1.) That we treat of
Friendship with Christ in its universal Idea, or abstract Nature; not in its
Concrete, or Subject: we show what our Friendship ought to be, not what we
always attain unto. (2.) Know that it is one thing to practice Truths, and
another thing to know we practice them; The meanest Christian does, daily, more
or less, practice this Truth, of electing Christ for himself, albeit he knows
not that he does it.

Lastly, Some of you, My dear friends, may perventure scruple at the Form of
this Discourse; as being too artificial, and clothed with too much of the
Egyptian Spoils, or human Learning. But let such remember; (1.) That what
Earings, or Jewels we have taken from the Egyptians, or Pagans, are only used
to adorn the Lord of Glory, from whom they al came. (2.) We use them, not as
essential parts of our Discourse, but only as Accidents, to illustrate, and set
off the Truth we deliver; that so carnal hearts may thereby be allured, to come
and see, what excellences are in our Lord. (3) It must be considered, that
there is a vast difference between the Word preached, and Printed Discourses
thereon. In Preaching the Word, the Minister acts as the Ambassador of Christ,
and invested with his Authority; and therefore the more he arrogates, or
assumes of Human Authority, the more he seems to derogate from the Authority of
Christ. The word Preached, the more it is clothed with its own native, virgin
simplicity; and the less mixture it has of human wisdom, and Autorities; the
more Authority and Efficacy it has, as I conceive, on Conscience. But now in
Printed Discourses, the case seems much different. For (1.) The Author acts
under a more private capacity, by virtue of his Gifts. (2.) In Printed
Exercices, I see no reason to the contrary, but that the Author may have
diverse ends, (though al subordinate to God's Glory) and so a mixture of
different Materials and Subjects, some Human, some Divine. Which is a
sufficient Apology for what mixture of human Argument you may find, in this
following Discourse; which is intended as an Idea, as well of Civil, as of
Divine Friendship; that so the Former may allure, and make way to the latter;
and the Latter give Spirit, and Perfection to the former.

Thus, my dear friends, I have given you some account of the Spirit, and Body,
the design and matter of the following Treatise. What remains but that we now
enter on, not only the Study and Contemplation, but also the practice of the
ensuing Subject? Which that we may, with Life, and Power engage in, and
perform, and so out-go, and outlive al false Hypocritick friends, of this
backsliding age, ought to be our daily Prayer; which is greatly desired of
you, beause greatly needed, by him, who conceives himself under many essential
obligations to be, first, entirely and inviolably the Lords; and in him,
entirely, and inviolably,

Yours, in all Christian friendship, and Service, Theophilus Gale.

SECT. 1. Of Friendship in General.
EVery Good, whether natural, civil, Of Friendship in general.
or Divine, is by so much the better, by how much the more Universal and
Communicative it is; and the more universal and communicative any Good is, the
more amicable or friendly it is. There is a kind of natural Friendship amongst
Inanimates: Natural friendship.
The Elements of Nature are under such an essential combination of natural
friendship, as that, to preserve the Interest of the whole, they often deny, yea
move contrary to their proper natural inclinations Amongst the four elements
Fire seems the most noble and friendly; because most publicly active and
communicative of its good. Yea the Sun, That the Sun is, (...), a celestial
fire, is the persuasion of the greatest Philosophers both Pagan and Christian,
as well modern as ancient; not to mention many Reverend Divines and learned men
of this Age: Of which else where.
which is supposed to be no other than a celestial fire, is of al Inanimates
most noble and friendly; because most universally active and communicative of
its heat, and influence; according to that description of the Psalmist, Ps.
19.5, 6. where the Sun is brought in under the shadow of a friendly Bridegroom,
rejoicing in his amicable communications to the Creatures: yea its said, there
is nothing hid from the heat thereof, i. e. not only the beauty of the Rose,
and virtues of al plants; but also the perfections of Minerals, the luster of
Gold and Silver, the sparkling of the Diamond, with other precious stones,
which lie hid in the bowels of the earth, owe their original to the Sun's
friendly communications of heat and influence.

The proper seat of Human Friendship is civil Society, Human friendship.
either personal, domestic, or more politic: and the more publick-spirited
and communicative men are, the more noble and friendly. Narrow-spirited and
selfish persons, such as are wholly clung to their own Interests, as they are
the reproaches of al societies, so likewise the most unfit to make friends. He
that cannot deny himself will soon deny his friend: he who is wholly wedded to
himself, will not stick to break with his best friends, if they stand in the way
of self-exaltation. It is the generous noble self-denying spirit, that makes
the best friend in all societies and relations, whether conjugal or more commun.
But of this more anon.

As for Divine Amity or friendship; Divine friendship.
God in Christ must necessarily be the best friend, because the most The
Philosophers make this one character of their chiefest Good that it be (...),
most diffusive or communicative of it self. Whence Plato says (...), that The
chief Idea of Good is the productive cause of al Good.
universal, diffusive, and communicative Good. God is such a Good as is commun
to al, and yet proper to each of his friends. Christ has no Interest of his own
Cross to the main Interest of his friends. Sin is therefore the worst evil,
and that which most obstructs the course of friendship, because it most
contracts and narrows the heart (which in it self is an universal, infinite
appetite) unto private, selfish ends, and Interests. Whereas Grace, so far as
it is predominant, makes men generous, publick-spirited and communicative in all
designs, and actions; and therefore it makes the best friends in all relations,
conditions, and stations. For Grace, being the Ressemblance or Image of God,
the most universal, best good and friend, the more it prevails in any soul, the
more friendly and actively useful will such be, in all Relations and Capacities.
Hence it appears, that the Saints Amity or friendship with Christ, God-man,
(whether we consider it objectively in regard of Christ, or subjectively in
regard of the Saints) is the most perfect Idea, exemplar or pattern of al
human friendship. Yea, we may be bold to say, that there is no real and cordial
Amity among men, but what has its Foundation in, No true Amity but what is
founded on Amity with Christ.
and Derivation from this Divine Amity, or friendship, 'twixt Christ and his
friends. He that is not a friend to God in Christ, is not truly a friend to any
other; no, nor yet to himself. We must therefore have recourse to this Divine
Amity with Christ, not only as the right pattern, but as also the spring of
al Amity amongst our selves. The Design therefore of this Treatise is, to
explicate and demonstrate, what are the Laws and Privileges of the Saints
friendship with Christ: which will also give us the best Idea, Foundation and
expedients for friendship amongst our selves, under al Relations, States, and
Conditions, both as men and Christians.

SECT. 2. The Paraphrase and Explication of the Text, John 15.14.
AS for the Foundation of this Discourse, we shall fix it on part of our Lords
farewel-Sermon, Joh. 15.14. Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command
you.

These words, as to the letter of them, The mind of the words, Joh 15.14.
are plain and familiar: Their mind and sense you may take in the following
paraphrase and explication. Friends are best known at parting: Christ is now at
parting-point with his Disciples: they seem to condole his departure; and hang
about him as loath to part; especially seeing his departure was like to prove so
prejudicial both to him and them. But our blessed Lord, to solace their
spirits, and revive their faith, gives them to understand they should be no
losers by his absence: for, Ye are my friends. As if he had said it is true, I
leave you in a persecuting, temting dirty world; yet be not overmuch concerned
about mine absence: Be assured I have such a bleeding sense of your condition,
such a fire of Affection, such tendernesses of compassion, such warm bowels,
an heart so large, so gracious, so sympathetick toward you, as that I may as
soon forget my self, as forget you: Know, that I am now going to bleed to die
for you, that you may live and reign with me; I go to take up my logement, for
three days, in a cold grave (that shadow of darkness) for you, that so you may
loge with me for ever in mansions of Glory: and after that I shall ascend up to
Heaven for you, and yet leave mine heart with you on earth. Its true, I shall
not then any more sigh, or weep, or bleed for you, yet shall I not be without a
deep sense of your sighing, weeping, and bleeding for and after me. Know, that
distance of place shall make no distance in mine Amity and friendship toward
you. Remember, in all your straits you have a friend in Heaven, who is not
unmindful of you on earth; albeit the world may lode you with disgrace,
reproaches, and a world of il-wil, yet I shall nevertheles own you as my friends:
yea, I shall then own you most, when the world, and perhaps your worldly
friends, do most scorn and reject you. You may expect most of my friendly
regards, affectionate care, and gracious vouchsafements, even then, when you
are most despised, persecuted, and hated by the World. In brief, assure your
selves, you shall find me always your best friend, and sometimes your only
friend: for, believe me, you are my friends. Only with this Proviso, if ye do
whatsoever I command you; i.e. If you approve your selves friends to me, by
observing al my commands, both particular, such as I have newly mentioned, and
more general, as it becomes friends. Or else, we may understand the words
thus: Ye are my friends: i. e. Ye shall approve your selves to be my friends: it
being usual with some penmen, especially this Evangelist, to express the
notification or manifestation of a thing by a verb that signifies its essence
or being: so Joh. 15.8. So shall ye be [ i. e. manifest your selves to be] my
Disciples.

To obviate a mistake here, we are to consider, that in this conditionate
proposition and promise, whereas there seems, (as some will have it) to be a
causal connection between the Antecedent, and Consequent; as if Christ's
friendship with us, had a dependence on our obedience to him, as the moral
cause thereof, Christ intends no such thing hereby: for he adds v. 16. Ye have
not chosen me, but I have chosen you, etc. i. e. my friendship to you, depends
not on your friendship to me, as the productive, meritorious moral cause
thereof; but on the contrary, your Friendship and obedience toward me, depends
on my election of you. Whence it is evident, that the conditional connexive
particle, If, in our text does not connote (1.) Any general decree or universal
Intention immanent in Christ, of friendship toward al. (2.) Nor yet any power
in corrupt Nature to perform such an obedience to Christ's commandments, as
may entitle men to this privilege of being the friends of Christ. (3.) Nor yet
any causal Dependence, or suspension of Christ's friendship on our obedience.
But Christ uses here (as elsewhere) this conditionate mode of proposing the
terms of his friendship. (1.) As a way most convenient and agreeable to human
Nature. (2.) To show the connection between man's Duty, and his favor, as also
how pleasing obedience is to him. (3.) As an Instrument, in and by which he
conveigheth the condition required.

Thus we see the words contain two parts 1. A gracious vouchsafement or
privilege on Christ's part, Ye are my friends. 2. A duty required, if ye do
whatsoever I command you. The proposition I collect hence, and lay as the
Foundation of the following Discourse, is this: That there are certain
universal and commun Laws of friendship even amongst men; which being duly
observed, by Believers, toward Christ, he is not ashamed to own them as
friends, and vouchsafe to them al such privileges as correspond therewith.

For the more full explication of this Proposition, we shall resolve it into
these two Questions. 1. What are those universal Laws of friendship among men,
which Believers ought to observe toward Christ? 2. What are those gracious
vouchsafements or privileges which Christ confers on his friends!

SECT. 3. The first Law of friendship in Election.
AS for the Laws of friendship amongst men they are either fundamental and
essential; The Laws of friendship.
such as tend to the constitution, and Being of friendship: or they are
perfective, such as conduce, though not to the very Being, yet to the
Improvement and Perfection of friendship. We shall begin with the essential and
fundamental Laws of friendship.

The first universal, fundamental Law of Amity or friendship among men, Al
friendship is founded on Election.
consists in a deliberate single complete election of our friend for himself.
Amity or friendship comes not by Nature, or by Accident, but by election and
choice: neither will every rash, forced, unstable, incomplete election suffice
to constitute true lasting friendship: but this election must be, 1.
Deliberate, 2. Single, 3. Complete, and that both as to the object and subject.
We shall discourse of these, each in their order, with endeavors to demonstrate,
how essential and necessary these are to our friendship with Christ.

That al true Amity or friendship is founded on Election or choice, is very
evident both from universal consent, commun Sense, and Reason. Hence the
Philosopher defines friendship, an (...) Plat. Defin.
election of one and the same kind of life. Farther, al true Amity and
friendship has its foundation in virtue: now no one is virtuous by Nature, or
by Accident, but by choice: (...). Arist. Eth. l. 3. c. 4. Hence Plato, Cratyl.
makes the Greek (...) a derivative from (...), because Virtue is most eligible.
election is most proper or essential, to virtue. And surely the election of
Christ for our friend, as it is our highest wisdom, so also virtue. No one
must ever imagine to share in the gracious vouchsafements of Christ, who will
not vouchsafe Christ a share in his hearts election and choice: Neither is it
every indiscrete, faint, instable, and incomplete election, that will serve to
constitute true Christian Amity and friendship; which, by how much the more
solid spiritual, comprehensive and transcendent a good it is, by so much the
more judicious, transcendent, and perfect must this election be.

CHAP. II. Christian prudence the foundation of al friendship; and more
particularly of that with Christ.
SECT. 1. A general account of Christian prudence, as the foundation of
friendship with Christ.
THE Election, This election must be judicious.
which is necessarily required to make up a sincere Amity and friendship, must
be rational, judicious and discrete. Indeed al human election does necessarily
presuppose a Judgment of Discretion; according to that of the Philosopher,
(...). Arist. Eth. l. 3. c. 4.
Election must be with reason and Judgment: again, (...). Arist. Eth. l. 3. c.
5.
Election is a consultative, or deliberative Appetite. And surely if
Consultation and Discretion be necessary to al Election, it is much more
requisite to this of Amity, especially as it regards Christ, which is the most
noble and excellent kind of friendship. Rash unadvised friendship seldom
proves sound or lasting: an hasty friend, and a slow enemy are accounted alike
dangerous. Yea, Turpe censetur statim amore occuparl, sine deliberatione.
Plato, Coviv.
how often does rash hasty friendship degenerate into down right enmity and
hatred? We have had too sad experiments of this in many seemingly forward
friends of Christ, who in time have proved professed enemies to him. Certainly
they who take Christ they know not why, will part with him for they know not
what: Such casual accidental Christians are not long-lived friends of Christ.
Their friendship to Christ is no better, than that of Turks to Mahomet; it
being bottomed only on some commun motives of Education, or Imitation: Their
grounds are only slight and inconsiderate; such, as if al other circumstances
concurred, would turn them into a Jewish or Mahumedan enmity against Christ.
There is no friendship with Christ, that will prove sincere and durable, but
what is bottomed on, and flows from a serious, judicious, rational election of
him; on substantial, essential grounds and proper motives apprehended by the
soul. The Physician tells us, Syn^^tu^.
that Nature makes no sudden mutations or changes: and every sudden mutation is
dangerous. This is thus far true here, that, he who suddenly jumps into a
profession of friendship with Christ, without much deliberation, and many
inward serious thoughts, what his friendship with Christ is like to cost him,
is in great danger of backsliding in a tempestuous day. Mat. 7.26.
Thus much our Lord himself assures us in that Parable, Mat. 7.26. The foolish
man which built his house upon the sand, is he that takes up his friendship
with Christ upon slight, inconsiderate grounds. Such hasty buildings have
seldom sure foundations. Wherefore Christ compares his real substantial
friend, Luke 14.28.
to a wise builder, that first sits down and considers his cost, Luke 14.28,
29, 30. For which of you intending to build a tower, sits not down first,
and counts the cost, etc. Christ speaks here in relation to his Cross, as it
appears from v. 27. and whosoever does not bear his cross, and come after me,
cannot be my Disciple. He that will espouse Christ for his friend, must withal
espouse his cross; and therefore it greatly concerns him, to sit down and
consider his charges. Such was Moses's consideration, in the election of Christ
for his friend, as we have it, Heb. 11.25, 26.
Heb. 11.25, 26. choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God,
etc. Moses had a full prospect of all the pleasures, honors, and advantages of
Pharaoh's court: he had also a judicious prevision, or foresight of those
afflictions, he was like to meet with in espousing Christ, and his persecuted
people for his friends; and after a serious deliberate debate (pro and contra)
in his own thoughts, he chose rather a suffering afflicted friendship with
Christ and his people, than the eye-pleasing delights, and heart-bewitching
Grandeur of Pharaoh's court. Here was indeed weighty and mature deliberation.
Without al peradventure, friendship with Christ is grounded upon the highest
and deepest Reasons; and therefore the deeper and stronger our apprehensions of
those Reasons are, the deeper and stronger will our friendship with Christ be.
Sanctified reason is the eye, not only of our soul, but also of our Amity and
friendship with Christ; which will be stronger or weaker according to the force
of those sanctified reasons on which it is grounded. Friendship backed with
spiritual, solid, deep, feeling, lively contemplations of Christ's excellences,
moves strongly toward, and closes intimately with him. It Is a great saying of
the Philosopher, (...). Plato Rep. fol. 382.
No fool and mad man is [Theophiles] a friend of God. Friendship with Christ,
though it does not find men wise and serious, yet it makes them so. It Is the
sinner, who is an enemy to Christ, that is the fool and mad man. Grace, which
makes men's friends to Christ, makes them also wise and deliberate.

SECT. 2. A Spiritual sagacitie or judgment of Discretion the foundation of
Amity with Christ.
BUT to speak a little more distinctly and closely to this first propriety of
our election. The parts of Christian prudence.
The Wisdom, reason or Judgment, which is to be employed in the election of a
friend, is styled Prudence; which is defined, (...). Def. Plat.
A faculty or power of it self productive of human happiness. This Prudence
contains in it these parts 1. A Sagacitie, or a spirit of Discretion for the
finding out the right end and object. 2. An Universal providence, or provision
of al such means as conduce to the attainment of our desired end. 3. A
Facility, and dexterity for the disposing of these means in the best manner
and method, in order to the prosecution of our end. Prudence necessary 1. To
discover the right end and object of our friendship.
Al these parts of Prudence are very requisite to al friendship, but especially
to the choice of Christ as our friend.

1. There must be a spiritual sagacitie or judgment of Discretion to find out
the right end and object of our friendship. This is indeed of huge
concernement, in order to the right constitution of friendship: for the last
end in morals has the same place with the first principles in speculatives, and
with the Form in Naturals. The last end infuseth sweetness, goodness, forces,
and life into all the means: therefore if this be naught our friendship can
never be good. Tu vero, Omnia cum amico delibera, sed de ipso prius: post
amicitiam credendum est, ante amicitiam judicandum. Seneca
In our Amity with Christ the last end, and ultimate object of our choice must
be no other than Christ himself: there is therefore required a spiritual
sagacitie to discover the excellences of Christ. Sagacitie is said to be (...).
Plat. Def. fol. 412.
an Acumen or sharpnes of Understanding, whereby we easily and speedily
penetrate, or dive into the nature and quality of things. Amongst irrational
creatures the Dog is thought to partake of a very great shadow hereof, Plato
makes the Dog to be endued with a very great natural Sagacitie for the
differencing his friends from his enemies. Plato Rep. 2. fol. 376. Life of
Padre Paul, page 60.
in that he can, at the first glance, discover his friend. And it is said of
Pad^e Paul the Venetian, that great Master of Prudence, 'That he could
immediately penetrate the nature, inclinations, and designs of men, and, like
a perfect Musician, make his judgment of the Instrument by the first touch:
so, by making men speak, he knew their ends, their Interests, their drifts,
their resolutions upon business, and with most admirable quicknes, the very
answers they could make; and so he regulated himself in all procedings.' Such a
sugacitie or sharp-sightednes is extremely useful in the choice of a friend;
especially of Christ; who is imcomparably the best of friends. Oh! were men so
quick-sighted and sage, as to discern those infinite beauties, and ravishing
glories of Christ's person; that Divine suavitie and goodnature of his
Disposition, those warm compassions and sweet tendernesses of his bowels,
those wonders and condescensions of his Grace; in brief, had men eyes to see,
what an ancient, laborious, industrious, bleeding, burning, rich, free,
unwearied, invincible love Christ bears toward sinners, they could not choose,
but choose him for their friend. But ah! alas! here lies the sinner's Hell, he
is quick-sighted toward Idol-lovers, but he has no eyes to see Christ, the
mysteries and wonders of his beauty, Grace and Glory; and therefore it is no
wonder, that Christ has so few friends in the world. Would the blind World but
take Philip's advice, and Nathaniel's practice, John 1.47. Joh. 1.47.
Come and see, what transcendent perfections, what imcomparable excellences,
sweetnesses, and heart-conquering mysteries of Grace, and Love, are to be found
in Christ, what a crowd of friends might he have? come and see will speak more
for Christ, to set forth his excellences, than the tongues of men or Angels can
do. But alas! men will not come, men will not see, and dive into the glorious
mysteries of Christ, and therefore it is no marvel that Amity or friendship
with him is so rare. The Philosopher tells us (...) Plato (...). fol. 206.
That a wise man does not praise his beloved, 'til after some familiarity he
knows him well. The wise men of the world commend not Christ as the best friend,
because they know him not; and they know him not, because they have no
familiarity, or acquaintance with him. Al men that have inward, feeling
experimental familiarity with Christ, commend and extol him, as the best
friend: no man that ever came to him, and tasted how good and gracious he is,
went away with repenting and hard thoughts of him. David, as a figure of
Christ, blesses the Lord for this spiritual sagacitie, as Psalm. 16.7. Psalm.
16.7.
I bless the Lord who has given me counsel. What counsel does he mean? why,
counsel or sagacitie to choose God for his friend and portion: as it is evident
from v. 5, 6. The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance, etc. He is so far
from envying of the wicked their portions, and friends, or from repenting of
his choice, that he blesses God al his days for this spiritual sagacitie or
counsel, which he gave him, to choose God himself, and none but God for his
friend. Yea, he is so much taken and satisfied in his choice, as that he cries
out to all the world, Psalm. 34.8.
Psalm. 34.8. O taste and see that the Lord is good. This spiritual sagacitie is
a Divine instinct, wrought by the spirit of God, whereby the soul first tastes,
and then sees the excellences of Christ. So Tyndal, on John 10.4, 5. (fol.
265.) 'If they ask, how we know that it is the Scripture of God? ask them, who
taught the Eagles to spy out their prey? even so the Children of God spy out
their father.' Divine instinct, backed with inward sense and spiritual reason,
gives the soul a clear, spiritual, affective sight of Christ; and so engages
the heart to move strongly toward him. For no knowledge works more powerfully,
than instinct of nature strengthened by reason. Those who have an inward
feeling taste of Christ's admirable sweetnesses, will see and know what an
excellent friend he is. The Philosopher defines (...). Platon. Def. fol. 413.
election, a right experimental probation, such as the Goldsmith has of metals.
This is most true here; the more inward, experimental, and familiar probation,
or trial, we have of Christ, the more cheerful, firm, and inviolable will our
election of, and Amity toward him be. It Is true, every friend of Christ has
not a feeling sense of his interest in Christ; yet he has deep sense of the
superlative excellence of Christ. Some good friends of Christ, have not the
sweet, joyous sense of Christ's presence, yet they have the bitter, bemoaning
sense of his absence; which argues some forgoing taste, how sweet friendship
with Christ is. Thus it was with the Spouse; even when she had lost his sweet
refreshing sense of Christ's comforting presence, she still retained a lively
sense of the bitterness of his absence, and superlative worth, as it appears by
the high character she gives of him, Cant. 5.11 -- 16. my beloved is white and
ruddy, Cant. 5.11. -- 16.
etc. Thus we see what spiritual sagacitie or sharp-sightednes is required;
also what foundation it has in spiritual sense, in order to the Election of
Christ as our friend.

SECT. 3. Sacred Providence or Consultation about means necessary to Friendship
with Christ.
2. ANother part of prudence, Providence or consultation about the means.
necessary for the constitution of a well grounded and inviolable Amity or
friendship, is Providence, or a prudent provision of such means as are most
conducible to our end. This providence is defined in the general, (...). Plat.
Defin. fol. 414.
a preparation for some future end or design. As to our present case, it
implies an universal comprehension of, and deliberation or consultation about
al such means, and particular circumstances relating thereto, whereby a firm
wel-grounded Amity may be maintained. This Providential prudence Arst. Eth.

of al means, it commends the (...). Platon. definit. fol. 414.
best to our election; in which it determines. These are the characters, which
the Philosopher gives of a good consultation. Now to draw down these general
rules to our present purpose. The soul that would arrive to a wel-grounded
election of Christ for his friend, must seriously consult and deliberate on al
such means as are most expedient for the prosecution, and obtainment of this
his end. For to choose a friend, without a serious consultation about, or
provision of such means as necessarily conduce to the maintaining and promoting
of such an Amity, is, even in the (...). Plato Conviv. fol. 184.
commun estimation of al prudent persons, but a rash, foolish, election. If
ever deliberation and providence be useful, it is in this case, namely for the
finding out the most apposite, and proper means for the promoting our
friendship with Christ. And the reason hereof is drawn from the difficulties,
which occur in making a clear, firm, solid, complete judgment, touching the
most proper means for the maintaining our Amity with Christ. It Is not here, as
in speculative Sciences, where the Premises being laid, the conclusion follows
of its own accord, without difficulty: no, Intellectus practicus propter
passiones variasqu^ occurrentes ^^^^mstantias d^fficilius veritatem attingit
quam speculat^ vus. St. Joseph. These 64.
here, in this undertaking of friendship with Christ, there occur various
irregular passions, cross humors, private Interests, and other material
circumstances, which very much obstruct the practick Conscience, in making a
right judgment of the means, albeit the end be already fixed: so that without
mature deliberation and consideration little good will be done. A soul that will
engage in Amity with Christ, must resolve upon parting with right eyes and
hands, things most dear unto him; which requires serious advice and
deliberation: he must also make account of being engaged in many a sharp Combat
with spiritual wickednesses in high places, with a frowning and flattering
world, and with a sly, deceitful, treacherous heart; Al which require a world
of spiritual prudence and caution. This very argument our blessed Lord
improveth, to provoke Christians to serious Consultation, and Providence, about
such means as may conduce to their friendship with himself. So Luke 14.31, 32,
33. Luke 14.31, 32.
Or what King going to make war against another King, sits not down first,
and consulteth, whether he be able with ten thousand, to meet him that comes
against him with twenty thousand, etc. The scope of the Parable is this: Christ
acquaints them, v. 26, 27. what a difficult conflict they had to engage in;
they must hate (comparatively) father, mother, wife, children, yea and life
also, if they would be his friends: Therefore he bids them sit down, and
consider what provision they had made, for such a difficult undertakement:
whether they had got armor of proof, and sufficient forces for such a difficult
exploit and warfare. Certainly they who unadvisedly rush into such a battle,
without their spiritual ar^or, the shield of faith, the sword of the spirit,
etc. must expect, ere long, to lie wallowing in the blood of their slain
friendship with Christ. He that is only a casual and rash friend of Christ,
cannot promise himself to be always such; as the Non promittit se talem in
perpetuum, qui casu bonus est. Senec.
moralist observes of a good man. He that intends to approve himself, what he
professes to be, as to friendship, must deliberately provide a sufficience of
spiritual Armor, and forces to carry him through al difficulties, he is like to
encounter with. Such was David's election of God for his friend, Psalm. 119.57,
58, 59.
Psalm. 119.57, 58, 59, 60. v. 57. Thou art my portion O Lord. There lies
David's choice of God for his portion or friend. Sensus est: Habeant sibi alii
suos honores, o^es, and caetera hujus^odi: At ego, O Domine, si^ statuo, Pars
and portio mea, etc. Muis.
As if he had said: some choose this, others choose that, others choose some other
inferior good for their portion: but as for me, Lord, I solemnly profess,
and that after serious deliberation, that I have no other portion or friend but
thee: let who will take these lower goods; give me thy self, I have enough, I am
content: I can neither expect nor desire a better good. And what follows? I
have said, that I would keep thy words. I have said, i. e. I have, upon serious
mature deliberation and consultation, peremtorily resolved. What? that I would
keep thy words: i. e. that I would vigorously prosecute al those means, by thee
prescribed, for the maintaining of this my election of thee for my friend. So
v. 58. I entreated thy favor with my whole heart, etc. i. e. I have chosen
thee, with the bent of mine heart, for my friend. What follows? v. 59. I
thought on my ways: There is a great Emphase in the Hebr. (...) diligenter
reputavi (nam verbum est Pihel) fac^ltate mibi primum data, quum duas cernerem
vias, unam Veluptatis, alteram Vertutis.
Verb, rendered I thought: which signifies here, I diligently weighed, and
deliberately considered every tittle, like those who cast accounts, comparing
every part with the other, to the intent that I might the better sum up the
whole. Of what? Of my ways: i. e. al those ways and means which lead me to a
more complete and perfect union and communion with thee as my friend. So it
follows: and turned my feet unto thy Testimonies. The like v. 60. I made have,
and delayed not to keep thy commandments. Festinavi. Sensus est: Re cognita
nihilsum cunctatus, sed mox praeceptis tuis servandis in^^bu^. Muis.
His deliberation was long and serious, but his execution was with have, and
without delay: which indeed is, by wise men, supposed to be one of the highest
pieces of Prudence. For to consult long, and warily on al means and ways, that
may promote our end, and then to execute speedily, is the most likely course to
render our designs and undertakements most effectual, and succesful. Such was
David's Deliberation and resolution in his election of God for his friend. If
our Deliberation about the means be rash and inconsiderate; and our resolution,
and execution slow and delatorie, such friendship, though it may begin with
much heat and warmth of Affection, yet it usually ends in shameful
disappointment, if not open Apostasy. Briefly; they who do hand over head (as
we say) or unadvisedly choose Christ for their friend, without solemn and due
consultation about the difficulties, that may impede or hinder, and the means,
which may promote their intended Amity, are seldom longlived, but never the
best friends of Christ. For friendship inconsiderately and easily acquired, is
usually as rashly and easily lost, when difficulties occur. This holds true in
civil, but much more in spiritual Amity, with Christ. Nothing therefore is
more requisite, to lay a firm foundation for friendship with Christ, than
mature deliberation and consultation, not whether or no we should make him our
friend, (that is past doubt and inquiry) but what are the most effectual
means, and expedite courses, to procure and promote friendship with him.

SECT. 4. Dexterity in the Disposement of means, a fundamental ingredient of
friendship with Christ.
ANother branch of human Prudence is dexterity or Facility of judgment,
Dexterity or facility in disposing of the means.
for the disposement and ordering of the means in the best method and manner,
in order to our more facile prosecution of the end. La prudence est dans
l'action, ce qu'est la Sapience dans la contemplation. Confer. Beaux Esprits
Confer. 13. p. 225.
Look what Sapience or Intelligence is in contemplation, the same is Prudence
in action. For the end in action and moral virtue, is the first principle in
prudence. So that as in Sciences, there is an huge use of Logic. and method
for the right disposition, ordering, and placing of terms, propositions, and
discourses, in order to the drawing down exact consequences and conclusions
from first Principles: just so it is in moral Prudence; it may not suffice that
we pitch on a right end, and choose the best means to prosecute this end; but
there is also required an exact disposing or ordering of those means, in order
to the more speedy and effectual prosecution of the end. This they call
Dexterity or Facility of Judgment; which is extremely necessary in all moral
actions, and no where more than in the election of a friend, but most of al in
the choice of Christ our best friend; as it will appear by an examen of the
several notions and offices thereof.

This Dexterity in the general, Dexterity What?
is an exactnes or equity of judgment, which gives to al things their just
weight, mesure, order, and place: and it has diverse Names and Offices; which
agree well with that Prudence whereby Christian Amity, especially with Christ,
is produced and maintained.

1. 1. Perspicacitie.
It is termed [(...)] a Perspicacitie of counsel, which (...). Plato, de Rep.
4. fol. 428. ubi addit Serranus: Dicit Plato (...), i. e. Consilii inveniendi
perspicacitatem praesstantissimum q^iden sapieatiae genus esse.
Plato defines, a manifestative Science; and supposes it to be one of the most
noble kinds of wisdom; because it gives unto things their just proportion,
order, and rank. Such indeed a Perspicacitie, or discrete counsel is very
advantageous for the constituting and promoting a right friendship betwixt men
and men; but more particularly betwixt men and Christ. He that will make Christ
his friend, and have conversation with him as such, needs much perspicacitie
and dexterity, so to order al his ways and course of life, as that there be a
sweet harmony, and happy combination between all the parts thereof; so that one
duty may not displace another, but each keep its proper rank and order.
Christian Amity, especially with Christ, is a very uniforme, harmonious and
equal thing: if there be any confusion or disorder in our ways, it will soon
make a schism or breach, so far as it prevails, in our friendship. So that
there is required much Divine Logic, and method, or holy Art to knit the parts
and Duties of our life so exactly together, as that there be no dissonance, or
jarring found amongst them. Hence this Perspicacitie or Dexterity is defined
by the Platonist, (...). Platon. Def. fol. 413.
a connatural virtue of reasoning, or a virtuous Logic. Certainly if natural
and artificial Logic be so greatly useful for the methodizing and right
ordering the parts of speculative Sciences; of how much greater use is this
Divine Logic, or sacred method, for the right ordering the parts and duties of
a Christians life and conversation with Christ as his friend?

2. 2. Experience a great orderer of Affairs.
This Prudent disposition of our ways and means is also termed (...)
experience; which has a mighty efficacious dexterity for the ordering of
Affairs, and therefore must needs be very useful for the breeding, and
maintaining of al friendship; but in a more peculiar regard, of the Saints
Amity with Christ. Plato tells us, (...). Plato Rep. 9. fol. 582.
that an experienced person, endued with prudence, is the only Philosopher: and
he gives this reason of it; because a prudent experience is the best Judge of
human Affairs. And, that experience is the chief nurserie of Prudence, the same
Philosopher proves else where (...). Plato Gorgias.
, because experience renders our lives regular and harmonious, according to
rules of Art: whereas inexperienced persons, upon the occurrence of any new or
strange Accidents, are liable to many irregularities, confusions, and disorders.
And the reason hereof is this: a prudent experience furnishes us with many,
and useful observations, and experiments; which being reduced to their several
classes and ranks, give us general rules and precepts, for the more regular
ordering and disposement of our ways and courses, in the prosecution of our
end. The particular occurrences and singular Accidents of our lives, are
wel-nigh infinite; and therefore are accounted as such: Singularia infinita,
per Prudentiae regulas reducuntur ad finita. Aquinas. Sum.
Now the infinite contingences, and severals of our lives, are, by the rules of
Prudent experience, reduced to a finite series, and regular order; which
renders our conversation more uniforme and orderly. By all this it evidently
appears, how greatly necessary a prudent experience is, both for the begetting,
and augmenting, as of Amity in general, so more particularly of our friendship
with Christ. An Election of a friend, founded on a prudent experience is ever
most firm, harmonious, and inviolable. And nothing makes the Saints walk more
orderly with Christ, as their friend, than a prudent experience of his and
their own ways. But of this more in the Perfective Laws of friendship.

3. 3. A facile method of learning our duties.
This Prudent disposement of our ways, is also styled (...), a facile or easy
method of learning; which they define (...), Plat. Des. fol. 413. (...), i. e.
generositas animi, and vis conjectandi id quod quemque decet. Ser.
a good disposition of the soul to learn speedily. By this good disposition of
the soul it is supposed, they mean, a greatness of mind, and faculty of
conjecturing at that, which most becomes every one. And surely al will grant,
such an easy method of learning, or faculty of conjecturing at what is most
becoming, is very necessary to al friendship, and more particularly to the
Saints Amity with Christ. The more skilful men are and facile in learning
their duties toward Christ, without al peradventure, the better friends they
will make. Such conjectures are most happy and succesful for the begetting of
friendship.

4. 4. Facile progression.
This prudent disposement of our ways is farther named, (...), a facile
progression, or easy method of procedure: which they define, (...). Plat. Des.
fol. 414.
a firm Facility of rational judgment; whereby our actions and ways are
regulated and ordered in the best manner. Which also greatly conduces both to
the begetting and maintaining of al friendship, Human and Divine.

5. Dexterity What.
Lastly, This prudent disposition of our ways and Actions is most properly
called (...), Dexterity: which is an habit of prudence governing and directing
al means so as they may al, in their respective stations, most directly conduce
to their end. Than which, what may we conceive to have a more soverain
influence on all friendship, but more immediately on our friendship with
Christ? were Christians so prudently dexterous, as to use and enjoy al things
in subservience and subordination to Christ, and their friendship with him, to
what a rate of communion with him might they attain? what incomparable friends
would they make? how visible and glorious would their friendship with Christ
be? But this is the bane of al our Amity with Christ, (which is also most
egregious imprudence) we confound the order and series of means and end; Utimur
fruendis, ac^ fruimur utendis, August.
we enjoy things to be used, and use things to be enjoyed. We enjoy the
creature and use God; we make the world our friend, and Christ its servant: or
else if our end be right, yet there is too often a confusion and disorder in the
use of means: How violently busy are we often about trifles, and how trifling
about things of the greatest moment? how do many seeming friends of Christ,
toil and sweat for earth, if not for Hell, but sport and play with Heaven? Yea,
do not too many friends of Christ, for the main sincere, engage their hands, if
not their thoughts and hearts, in such a crowd of worldly affairs, though
materially good, as that their spirits are distracted and unfitted for
conversation with Christ as their friend. This seems to have been the folly of
Martha, for which she is friendly, yet sharply, rebuked by her Lord, Luke
10.40, 41. v. 40. it is said, Marth^ was cumbred about much serving. Luke 10.40,
41.
The service she was employed in, was materially good, yea of the best kind:
for what more laudable, than to provide for her Lord, who was so good a friend?
yea, she thought it so great a piece of service for her Lord, as that she comes
to him, with desires that he would dismiss her Sister Marie, to assist her.
Wherein then lay her blame? why, it lay in this; she wanted this sacred
dexterity, or facility of disposing and ordering her Affairs. For it is said,
v. 40. She was cumbred about much service. Though the Service was of the best
kind; and both an effect and argument of her friendship with Christ, yet it
was, 1. Too much: (...) usurpant de ministeriis hujus vitae. Grot.
She wanted dexterity to give the just weight and mesure as to the quantity.
2. She wanted also dexterity, as to the manner, or right ordering of her
Service: for she was cumbred, (...).
, or hurried here and there; full of confusion and disorder. Yea 3. These
hurries so far prevailed on her spirit, as to cause a distraction and schism
therein: so v. 41. (...).
Martha, Martha thou art careful, or, as it were, torn in pieces with anxious
solicitous cares. Whence 4. follows another defect as to dexterity, it is said:
She was troubled. The word signifies (...), inq^iunt Graeci Grammatici, proprie
(...): ^^de porro ad caetera transfertur. Suidas exponit (...). Distraheris,
Latini dicerent, Grot.
such a trouble, as procedes from the raging of the Sea, when it casts up mud
and filth, or from troubled waters, when the mud is stirred, etc. Her spirit
was so disturbed about those two many things, as that it cast forth many dirty
thoughts, etc. 5. She wanted dexterity as to the timing of her Service. It had
been more fit for her, at this time, to have, with her Sister Marie, minded
that one thing necessary, namely communion with her Lord in spirit, mentioned
v. 42. But one thing is needful and Marie has chosen that good part, etc. What
was Mary's choice? why, 'twas, as v. 39. to sit at Christ's feet, and enjoy more
spiritual communion with him. Thus we see, how far good friends of Christ, for
want of this prudent dexterity, or holy skill to order their Affairs aright,
may, even in their services for Christ, fall into many errors and miscarriages,
even against those laws of friendship they profess. As al Vice, whether
natural or moral, consists (...). Plato Phaedo 92.
in an Ataxie, or disorder, and confusion; so al Grace in an Eutaxie, or
good-order, and harmony. Pythagoras.
Hence some o^ the Philosophers held, that Virtue was nothing else but a
symmetrie, or Harmony. And if this Good order or Harmony be essential to al
virtue, how much more than is it requisite to friendship, especially between
the soul and Christ, which is one of the highest degrees of virtue. The poor
Philosopher could say, (...), Plato Protag. 3. fol. 326.
that the whole life of a man should consist of a good ryme, and right
harmony: Whence he makes Harmony and Symmetrie to be the soul, not only of
the moral, but also of the natural World. Is not this more properly applicable
to the Saints friendship with Christ? Prudent order, the soul of Amity.
what does more spirit, animate, beautify, and confirm Amity with Christ,
than an holy order, and Divine Harmony in our ways and conversation? And what
can be more soverainly efficacious, and expedient for the begetting this sacred
order, than this spiritual, prudent Dexterity, which we have been treating of?
Spiritual light and prudence is the best orderer of things: Sinners void of the
light of life, are loged in the grave of sin, where there is no order, but
confusion; yea their light is darkness, as Job speaks of the natural death, Job
10.22. Job 10.22.
A land of darkness, as darkness it self, and of the shadow of death, without any
order, and where the light is as darkness. Sinners, whose light is darkness,
cannot but be full of disorder and confusion: for all disorder comes from
darkness. Thence Job 37.19. Job 37.19.
it is said, we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness. None can order
their words and ways aright, but such as are endued with the spirit of God,
and saving light. Whence David prays, Psalm. 119.133. Psalm. 119.133.
Order my steps in thy word, i. e. cloth me with a spirit of wisdom, or
prudent dexterity, that so I may order my steps according to thy word, and
approve my self thy faithful friend. And such as do thus prudently order their
ways, have a promise of the highest manifestations of Divine friendship, Psalm.
50.23.
as Psalm. 50.23. To him that orders his conversation aright, will I show the
salvation of God. We see then how essentially, and universally useful this
Divine Prudence is, both for the production and conservation of friendship in
general, but more particularly, of that Amity which ought to be 'twixt the
soul and Christ. I shall sum up the whole of this particular in a brief
character of Divine Prudence, as it relates to friendship with Christ. This

CHAP. III. The Election of a single Christ in opposition to Sin, Self, the
World, and the Law.
SECT. 1. The Saints friendship with Christ is conjugal; and therefore Christ
is singly to be Elected.
AS the foundation in Artificials gives union, A found Head and a sincere Heart
the great springs of al friendship.
and strength; and the Head in Naturals affords Influence and Conduct to the
whole body: the like does Prudence in Morals; particularly in Friendship, as
it has been shown. But yet if Prudence be the root and Head, the Will is the
Heart, where friendship has its proper Seat and Throne: So that, not only a
sound Head, but also a sincere heart is essentially and fundamentally necessary
to the constitution of true Amity, whether human, or Divine. This leads us to
the remaining Characters of the first fundamental Law of friendship; namely,
that it be founded on a single complete election of our friend, and that for
himself. These Adjuncts or Attributes, given to this Election, refer both to
its object and subject, i. e. we must choose a single complete object, for it
self, with a single, complete Heart. Wherefore we shall discourse of these
Attributes under both their references.

First, 1. Touching the object of this Election.
As for the object of this Election it must be single, and complete, in all
friendship, whether human or Divine. We shall, with the Lord's gracious
Assistance, examine each of these in their order.

First, 1. It must be ^ingle either, 1. Comparatively.
The Object of this Election must be single, at least comparatively, if not
absolutely. For, (1.) Al friendship amongst men requires, that its object be
comparatively single: that is, that the heart admits not of any corrival, or
other friend, who stands in direct opposition to, or competition with his elect
friend. For every one may be justly reputed, so far an enemy to his friend, as
he is a friend, though but secretly, to his friend's enemy. Or 2. Absolutely
as in conjugal friendship.
But (2.) There are some kinds of friendship which require a single object
absolutely; as that between conjugal Relations. Conjugal Amity, as such,
absolutely excludes al degrees of comparison, in the same kind, as to al other
lovers and friends. He or she that has the least degree of true conjugal love,
or friendship for any other person, save that to whom he or she is joined, by a
conjugal Election or Mariage-consent, offers violence to the very fundamental
Laws of conjugal friendship, and may be accounted an Adulterer, or Adulteress;
at least so far as this irregular passion prevails. For the very formal
nature or reason of conjugal friendship excludes al corrivals, or copartners
with its friend. This is a sealed fountain; if any streams issue forth to other
lovers, the whole is poisoned, Prove. 5.15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. Prove. 2.17.
Cant. 4.12.

Now such is the friendship betwixt Christ and a gracious soul; The friendship
betwixt Christ and his friends conjugal, and therefore the object single.
it is conjugal, and therefore requires absolutely a single object of its
election or choice. That soul who admits any other but Christ, to share in the
same Kind of conjugal Affection, which it owes to Christ, is guilty of
spiritual adultery, and fornication. There is a full character of a soul
espoused to Christ, Cant. 4.12. a Garden enclosed is my Sister, Cant. 4.12.
my Spouse, a spring shut up, a fountain sealed, i. e. her conjugal friendship
is wholly reserved for Christ, and for none other. Whence v. 8. he calls upon
her, Cant. 4.8.
to come from the Lions dens, from the montains of the Leopards, i. e. to
renounce friendship with all old lovers, which were either open or secret
enemies to him. For as the Lion signifies an open fierce enemy, so the Leopard
or Panther implies a cunning, sly enemy, which, under pretense of friendship,
does more effectually hurt: Non patitur Divinus sponsus illam quan tori sociam
habere vult, morari in sylvestribus locis, ubi Leonum sunt and pard^run
cubilia. Sanctius in l.
For this Beast is estimed a friend to all Beasts except the Dragon; and thence
by the beauty of his skin, or sweetness of his smell allures all beasts to him.
Whence Antichrist, that great enemy of Christ, is Rev. 13.2. ressembled under
this symbolick Image of a Leopard; which sets forth his secret, cunning
enmity, masqued under a pretext of seeming friendship. So Hos. 13.7. We have
the Lion and the Leopard joined together, as expressive of Gods open and secret
enmity against his backsliding people. Thus Christ admonishes his spouse, to
refuse friendship with all old lovers, which were either Lions or Leopards, open
enemies, or false friends to him, that so she might be as a garden enclosed, a
spring shut up, a fountain sealed for himself, and himself alone. The like
Admonition Christ gives his contracted spouse, Psalm. 45.10, 11.
Psalm. 45.10. Hearken (O Daughter) and consider, and incline thine ear: forget
also thine own people, and thy fathers house. 11. So shall the King greatly
desire thy beauty: for he is thy Lord, and worship thou him. That this is
spoken of the Spouse or friends of Christ, the very Title of the Psalm
imports, which is a song of loves, i. e. betwixt Christ and his conjugal
friends. What then does Christ exhort his conjugal relations unto? (1.) (...)
signifies both diligent Attention, and also Obedience.
To bearken, i. e. to give diligent attention to those conjugal Articles, or
Laws, which were incumbent on her to observe. (2.) Not only diligently to
attend, but also to consider, i.e. (...) Which denotes vigilant circumspection
and deep deliberation.
to consult, deliberate, and weigh exactly, what are the most proper expedients
and means, for the completing and perfecting her conjugal union, and communion
with her Lord. And then the Psalmist proposes, (3.) That she (...) i. e. Bend
thine heart to a ready closure.
ineline her ear: i. e. not only consider and advise warily about the means,
but also cheerfully to consent unto, and embrace such as were most expedient
for the accomplissment of her end. She was to consider and debate long, and
maturely, about such means as were best for the accomplissement of this so
happy match; but, the deliberation and consultation being over, she was to
incline her ear, i. e. cheerfully to consent, and speedily to execute those
means, which were judged fittest for the attaining her end. Thence (4.) the
Psalmist acquaints us, what the first and main of these means were; namely,
Forget also thine own people and thy fathers house. As if he had said, look as
those who enter into conjugal friendship and relation, have their conjugal
Affections so far melted and dissolved into their beloved friend, as that they
do in a manner forget al old relations, though never so near allied by blood,
even Father, Mother, etc. (...) Et Obliviscere populi tui, and Domut patris
tui. i. e. Morum patriae and ritu^m. Vates sponsam admonet, si sponsam velit
amore sui accendere, necesse esse, ut suae Gentis a^ paternae Domus, corumque
o^nnium, quae antea charissi^a habuit prorsus obliviscatur, ac marito tantum
placere studeat. Muis.
so must thou have thine heart divorced from al old lovers, though never so
near akin to thee, if thou will enter into a conjugal friendship with thy Lord.
Conjugal Affection and relation contracts and gathers in the Affections, which
lie loose and in commun among many friends, to one single person: so must the
conjugal friend of Christ, call home his scattered and wandering affections, and
cause them al to center on their best beloved. Whence it follows. (5.) v. 11.
So shall the King greatly desire thy beauty, i. e. Be thou wholly for him, and
he will be wholly for thee: let thy Affections be taken off al old Lovers, and
Knit entirely to him, and his Affections shall be entirely knit to thee: be
thou content with him, and he shall be content with thee: let the King have his
Throne al alone in thy heart, and his heart shall be as it were alone set on
thee, So shall the King desire thy beauty. Ration^m adf^rt cur studere debeat,
ut placeat marito. Muis.
And thence (6.) follows the second reason, why she should forget her own
people and fathers house: For he is thy Lord, and worship thou him, i. e. He is
not only thy Husband but Soverain Lord, to whom al Divine Adoration and worship
does appertain: wherefore if thou reservest, in the supreme conjugal bent of
thine heart, which is thy Lords Temple and Throne, any secret haunt for old
lovers, thou art guilty, not only of spiritual Adultery, but also of
Idolatry: for he is thy Lord, whom alone thou must adore, or worship, with
spiritual-conjugal faith, love, and obedience. Thou art mistaken if thou
think to mediate a league of friendship, betwixt thy New Lord, and old
lovers: no, he will have his alone in the inmost bent of thine heart, which is
his sacred Temple, or rather the Holy of Holies, where none may enter or Loge
but himself: there is room for other Lovers in the out-loges of the Affections,
but none here, in this sacred Bent of thine heart, save for thy Lord: he alone
must be extolled and worshipped here. He that studies, and endeavors to make a
composition betwixt Christ and any old friend, so as to allow them both a share
in the inmost bent of his spiritually conjugal love, does but delude himself
with a framed shadow, or Idol-Christ, of his own fancy. A compound-Christ is a
false Christ: if we choose not a single Christ for our friend, we choose nothing,
but a coined Idol of our own deluded hearts: he that adds any thing to Christ,
as a copartner in his spiritual conjugal friendship, destroys the whole of
Christ, as to benefit. All this is set forth to the life in that Parable, Hosea
3.1, 2, 3. v. 1. Hos. 3.1, 2, 3.
Then said the Lord unto me, go yet, love a woman (beloved of her friend, yet
an adulteress) according to the love of the Lord toward the Children of
Israel, who look to other Gods and love flagons of Wine. The case stood thus:
The Jews had entered into a conjugal covenant of friendship, with God, as you
have it, Jer. 2.2, 3. I remember the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine
espousals, etc. But Israel had broken her conjugal covenant with God, as this
Prophet Hosea declares at large, chap. 1.2. whence She is here styled an
Adulteress, because, albeit she retained the profession and worship of God in
part, yet she looked to other Gods, and loved flagons of Wine, Propter
voluptates colunt Idola, magis de victu, quam de Dei cultu solliciti Tarnovius.
Intellige ho^ de Idololatrarum ^o^viviis: plerumque enim haec conjunguntur,
superstitio and luxus. Rivet.
: i. e. she found good emolument, or incomes of pleasures and riehes by the
flagons of Wine, or drink offerings which were poured forth to other Gods;
therefore she looks toward them, or gives them a share in that conjugal
friendship and worship which was due to God alone, as Zeph. 1.5. Yet for all
this, though Israel had thus broken wedlock with God, yet he had an
affectionate compassionate eye toward her: she was beloved of her friend
though an adulteress; God had a mind to enter into a new covenant of conjugal
friendship with her: but how? would God be content that Israel should lie in
commun for him and Idol-Gods? No; but first he redeems her Affections by
out-bidding other lovers; and so will have her as a garden enclosed and a
fountain sealed, proper to himself. So v. 2. So I bought her to me for fiveteen
pieces of Silver, etc. V. 3. And I said unto her, thou shall abide for me many
days, thou shall not play the Harlot, and thou shall not be for another man,
so will I also be for thee. As if the Lord had said: O my backsliding Spouse, I
have yet once again ransomed thee, both by price and power, from thine
Idol-lovers; look well to it, that thou play not the Harlot again: be thou for
me, and not for any other lover, and I will be for thee: approve thy self a
loyal friend to me, and dout not but that I shall approve my self so to thee.
Thus Cant. 6.3. Cant. 6.3.
I am my beloveds, and my beloved is mine, i. e. I am wholly and singly for my
Beloved, as he is wholly and singly for me: Si^ut speculum figuram nullam
habet, sed illam admittit, quam is quem habet coram, objicit; sic spo^sa
fidelis praeter s^onsum nullum ad as^oct^m admittit. Sanctius.
I am in regard of conjugal love and subjection, not mine own, but his: as he
is, in point of conjugal love and care, not his own but mine. Its true, my
beloved cease not to be his own, when he becomes mine; but yet he demeaneth
himself as if he were not his own; he assumeth such intimate Relations, and
bowels, of an husband, friend, savior, etc. as bespeaks him wholly mine, and
therefore it is my duty to make over my self, my Thoughts, Admirations,
Affections, Person and al to him; so that I am now to mind, admire, live in,
possess, enjoy, and delight in him, and not my self; I am to reject every
Idol-lover and friend.

Thence God tells the Israelites, that he would not deliver them, til they had
put away their false Gods, Judges 10.13, 14. Judge. 10.13, 14, 15.
Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other Gods: wherefore I will deliver you no
more. Go cry unto the Gods ye have chosen, and let them deliver you in the
time of your tribulation. God upbraids them with their Idol-Gods and false
lovers. But yet when the Israelites had put away their Idols, and humbled
themselves before God, it is said the Lord's s^ul was grieved for their
misery, v. 15, 16. The like Hos. 14.3, 4. Hos. 14.3, 4, 8.
When Israel is brought to renounce al Idol-lovers and false Gods, then, and
not til then, Christ comes in as a friend, promising to heal her backslidings.
So v. 8. Ephraim shall say, what have I any more to do with Idols? and what
follows? I have heard him, and observed him, etc. Christ will never hearken to
us as a friend, so long as we have to do with Idols.

Thus Hos. 2.15, Hos. 2.15, 16.
16, 17. when God takes Israel again into Covenant with himself, he will have
her forget the names of Baalim, her old Idol lovers, and call him Jshi, her
Husband. Thus the soul, that enters into a conjugal friendship with Christ,
must be for him singly, and for none other: he must not add to or compound any
thing with Christ; but must bid adieu unto, and abandon al old lovers, which
may pretend unto, or aim at the least share in the bent of the heart, or that
conjugal Affection which is alone due to Christ.

SECT. 2. Reprobation of sin, by the friends of Christ.
BUT now to descend to particulars, Four old lovers which pretend a share in
our conjugal love.
there are 4 old friends, or lovers which pretend unto, and aim at an interest
in that conjugal affection and friendship, which is alone due to Christ; and
those are, 1. Sin. 2. Self. 3. The World. 4. The Law as a Covenant. The first
two are interne, and bosome-friends; and therefore more apt to betray us: the
latter, albeit more externe and foreign, yet are they exceeding dangerous, and
very prone, either by their smiles, or frowns, to get a share in that conjugal
friendship, which is due to Christ. Whoever therefore does really intend and
desire, to enter into a solemn League and Covenant of Amity with Christ, must
abandon each of these, so far as they stand in opposition to, or competition
with Christ; who must have his royal Throne, al alone, in the bent of the
heart. And this indeed suits with the nature of al election formally
considered: For Cujus est approbare ejus est reprobare.
al election, in its strict notion, does import a reprobation of something: he
that elects one thing, reprobates another. So he that elects Christ for his
friend, must reprobate or refuse al these old Idol-lovers, so far as they
pretend unto any share in that conjugal Affection, which is due to Christ, and
to him alone.

1. 1. The friend of Christ must reprobate and reject sin.
He that will espouse Christ for his friend, must absolutely renounce, yea, bid
open defiance unto sin, that bosom inmate, which pretends much kindness for us,
but is indeed a sworn enemy, not only unto Christ, our best friend, but also
to our selves. The Philosopher could tell us: (...). Arist. Rhet. l. 2. c. 4.
That those who are truly friends, have the same enemies, and friends. This
holds most true here; he that is a friend to Christ is an enemy to sin; and so
on the contrary, he that is a friend to sin, is an enemy to Christ. To pretend
unto an election of Christ as our friend, without any sincere reprobation of
sin, is a contradiction in Christianity. What? a friend of Christ, and yet
reserve secret haunts for beloved lusts? a friend of Christ, and yet indulge
thy self in secret, if not open sins? a friend of Christ, and yet one that
do allow thy self in known provocations against Christ? a friend of Christ,
and yet as vain in thine apparel and gestures, as frothy in thy discourses, as
voluptuous and flesh-pleasing in thine use of the creatures, as proud and
scornful in thy behavior, as vainglorious in self-exaltation, as worldly and
greedy of lucre, as other worldlings? oh! what a monstrous contradiction is
this? Again, art thou a pretender to friendship with Christ, or yet a frequent,
yea wilful neglecter of Christian duties, both private in thine alone, or
retirements, and more public in thy relations? Art thou an Angel in the
Church, but a Devil in thy Family, at least in thine own heart? Certainly if
this be good friendship with Christ, then Hell is crowded with a world of good
friends of Christ. Such false friends were those apostatizing Jews, Zeph. 1.5.
who swear by the Lord, Zeph. 1.5.
and by Malcham: (...), unto (not by) the Lord and to Malcham, i. e. they
profess friendship to God, yea bind themselves to him by an oath of Allegiance
and Supremacy, to be for him and for none other: but yet under hand, they
swear also to Malcham: i. e. their Idol Molock, to whom they give allegiance
and homage as well as to God; Which indeed was a flat contradiction. For God and
Baal can no more be reconciled, than Heaven and Hell. This is the commun case of
a world of seeming friends: They swear both to the Lord and to Malcham: they
profess conjugal friendship to Christ, and yet retain some Idol-lust, some
Image of Jealousy, which must go halves with Christ. Thus do many false
friends of Christ, study and meditate, how they may mediate a league between
Christ and lust: Christ they must have, to quiet the clamors of conscience, and
lust they must have, to quiet and content their hearts: hence they compound al
differences betwixt Christ and lust. This is an Hel-bred friendship, yet too
commun among the crowd of Professors. How far a false friend of Christ may
proceed in the reprobation of sin.


Neither will every laxe and partial reprobation of sin suffice, to constitute a
sincere election of, and conjugal friendship with Christ. Many a seeming friend
of Christ may proceed very far in turning from sin, and yet never turn to
Christ; yea continue still a secret, and at last turn an open enemy to him.
How far did Herod go in joyful attendence on John's Ministry, and
Reformation, til it came to part with his Herodias? and then he chooses to part
with John's head, and life by Christ, rather than with her, as Marc. 6.10. Luke
3.18. Did not Demas proceed far, and cleave long to Christ? was he not much
estimed by the Apostles? Do they not make honorable mention of him in their
writings? And yet did not the love of this world so far prevail upon him, as
that at last he left Paul, and the work of the Ministry, and turns Merchant,
2 Timothy 4.10. he has forsaken me and loved this present world, he forsakes
Christ, and Christ forsakes him. 1. As to judgment.
(1.) A false friend of Christ, may have many dreadful apprehensions of the
damning nature of sin; yea he may feel some scorching terrors, and heats of
Divine wrath in his conscience for sin; which may fill him with great
indignation against sin, so far as it carries a sting and torment in it; and
yet all this while he allows and approves of it in his (...), as sweet or
profitable: he may have ^^^^gement of conviction and Discretion against (...),
as it is the fuel of Divine wrath, or he^^^re, and yet he may have a judgment
of Approbation for sin, as pleasing to corrupt nature. 2. As to will.
(2.) Neither may the false friend of Christ, have his Judgment only turned
against sin, but his heart also may, in some mesure, by many faint wishes,
partial vows, and legal Covenants against sin, very far depart from it. How
many pretending friends of Christ are there, who make solemn vows against
their sins, but after their vows make inquiries, (as Solomon observes) how they
may reconcile their Lusts and Christ? Do not many, with solemn protestations,
turn out sin at the street door, as a rebellious son, and yet soon after, take
it in again at some backdoor? Are not many men's covenants against sin, (1.)
Either extorted and wrung from them by reason of the heats and gals of their
conscience? (2.) Or partial? they covenant against some sins, that so they may
retain other sins with more security. (3.) Or legal? they covenant against sin
in their own strength, and so soon fall into the hands of that sin they covenant
against. (4.) Or conditional? they covenant to quit sin, provided it will not be
a more dutiful obedient servant. (5.) Yea, do not the most of men's covenants
against sin serve as a blind to concele their sins? yea, as food to nourish,
strengthen, and improve sin; at least inward heart-lusts? Thus do many seeming
friends of Christ make al their Vows and Covenants against their sins, but as
expedients subservient to the concelement, strength, and growth of sin. In
brief, the bent of their heart is toward sin, while they seem, with many
protestations and vows, to reprobate the same: they have fatherly bowels
rolling toward sin whiles they seem most displeased with it: they are offended
at sin, not because God is offended at it, but because it offends their peace,
and troubles their consciences, etc. 3. As to conflicts with, and mortificaons
of sin.
(3.) Yet farther; a false friend of Christ may arrive, not only to some faint
inclinations and protestations of heart against sin, but also to some sharp
combats with, and some seeming mortifications of sin. The light of conscience
may fight against the lusts of his heart: as it was with Balaam, Numb. 22.18.
externe branches of sin may be lopped off: Acts of sin may be suspended: some
sins may be pursued even to death. Yea, not only outward Acts, but inward
lustings may be in part quenched. Yea, the root of sin may seem very far
withered. And all this but feigned conflicts, and superficial mortification of
sin, which determine in the greater prevalence and sovereigntie of sin. For all
their combats, and struglings against sin, do but more miserably entangle them
in sin: while the acts of sin grow more feeble and weak, the inward Dominion of
sin grows stronger, and more violent; like a torrent pent up with banks. The
more emty the streams of sin are, the fuller is the fountain: when sin seems
most asleep, it is often least mortified, and most lively within: As in malignant
diseases, when the humor strikes in, it grows more incurable. Mat. 22.25, --
28. This is the case of many a seeming friend of Christ.

But now it is far otherwise with those who really choose Christ as their
friend. What are the postures of Christ's sincere friends toward sin. 1. As to
their judgment.
(1.) As to their Judgments, they ha'nt only a conviction, but also a
reprobation of sin: they see sin, not in the Devils minorating glass, but in
the magnifying glass of Gods law: they contemplate sin not only in the notion
and Idea; but really, and intuitively: they see the thing it self, and that in
its monstrous ugly shapes, and aggravations: whence sin appears to them
exceeding sinful, Romans 7.13. Romans 7.13. (...).
They see in sin al moral and natural evil; al weakness, poverty, servitude,
shame, reproach, deformity and debasement of human Nature. And these their
convictions of sin are real, spiritual, deep, feeling and constant: their eye
lids are kept open, so that fresh light and convictions of sin break in, every
day more than other, as it was with Asaph, Psalm. 77.4. Thou hold mine eyes
waking. 2. As to their consciences.
(2.) The true friends of Christ, do not only see sin in its colors, but also
feel the weight of it: though perhaps they have not the melting sense of
Christ's love, yet they have the bitter sense of sin: it is true, they feel not
always the workings of their friendship to Christ, yet they feel the burden of
their provocations against Christ; which is to them the worst of Hels: they
find more malignitie, and bondage in The least moral evil of doing, than in the
greatest natural evil of suffering. 3. (...) then will.
(3.) Hence the loyal friend of Christ, has the Bent of his heart strongly set
against sin: his displeasure against sin boils up to an high degree of hatred,
revenge, and Antipathie; which is the most deep, and rooted emnitie; that which
springs from an instinct or Law of Nature, and vents it self against the whole
kind. So great is his hatred against sin, Psalm. 79.10. Prove. 8.13. Yea, he
hates the very sin he commits, and loves the good he omits, Romans 7.15, 16. He
has also a spring of godly sorrow in his heart: he is troubled and grieved for
sin, not only because it grieves and troubles his conscience, but also because
his best friend Christ, is grieved and wounded thereby: his heart bleeds for
sin, because it caused the heart of his Lord to bleed to death: his spirit is
broken for sin, because the law of his God is broken thereby: his sorrow for
sin is very fruit-bearing, 2 Cor. 7.9, 10. (4.) Again, the real friend of
Christ does not only hate, and mourn for sin, but also fight the Lord's
Battles against sin. His heart takes part with God against sin, even when his
members are engaged for sin against God, Romans 7.15, 16, 19. He fights against
sin, not with carnal, or legal, but with evangelick and spiritual weapons, 2
Cor. 10.4. For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty, etc. He
takes unto him the whole Armor of God, Ephesians. 6.13, 14, etc. He takes the sword
of the spirit, whereby he lets forth the heart-blood of sin, Romans 8.13. H^
makes use of the shield of faith, dipped in the blood of Christ, which is very
efficacious to keep off the fiery darts of lust, Heb. 9.14. Neither are his
conflicts against sin at a distance only, but very intimate and close, in the
same faculty; Divine light against carnal wisdom, love to Christ against
sinful lusts; godly sorrow against carnal grief: these fight hand to hand, in
the mind, will, and Affections. Neither does he fight against grosser sins only,
but also against more spiritual, refined lusts; as spiritual pride, unbelief,
self-love, hypocrisy, carnal confidence, presumption, formalitie in duties,
hard-heartednes, carnal seouritie, and spiritual sloth. Moreover, he has more
vehement conflicts with his beloved darling lusts; such sins as are most
flesh-pleasing or profitable; most presuming, and domineering, Psalm. 19.13.
which do more easily beset him, and for which corrupt nature does most cater,
and provide. But above al sins, he is mostly vexed with, and therefore most
vehemently set against his corrupt Nature; which is the heart, the cursed root
of bitterness, the poisoned fountain, that gives life, malignitie, and venom to
al other sins: he strikes not only at the branches, but lays the axe to this
root of sin: he endeavors not only to purge the streams, but also to sweeten
the fountain: his main work is not only to cure the botches and breakings forth
of sin, but to drive the malignitie from the heart: though sin may gain some
loging in his externe members, yet he will allow it no quiet abode in the heart,
Romans 7.22, 23. In short; the sincere friend of Christ, albeit he may be often
foiled by sin, yet he rises again; yea he falls forward, and gains ground by
his false: his being foiled by sin, does end in his greater victory over sin;
in that it makes him more humble, self-denying, believing, etc. So that often,
when the Acts of sin are most violent and strong, the Dominion of sin is most
impotent, and weak; as it is with nature in dying pangs, he even then overcomes
most, when he seems most overcome by sin: Sin is not only asleep, or Sick, but
dead in him: and the death of sin is the life of his friendship with Christ.
His reprobation of sin ends in the election of Christ. Heb. 6.1. These are the
postures of Christ's friends toward sin.

SECT. 3. The Election of, and Amity with Christ, presupposes the
Renunciation of irregular self.
2. 2. The Election of Christ presupposes a renunciation of irregular. self.
ANother great corrival, which sues for an interest in that conjugal Amity,
and friendship which is due to Christ alone, is self. This is a more secret and
sly competitor with Christ, but by so much the more dangerous, Self is a more
masqued enemy; which often carries the face of a friend, not only toward the
soul, but toward Christ also: and yet there is not a greater enemy in the
world, either to Christ or the soul, than irregular, inordinate, and lawless
self. It Is therefore great folly, yea madness, to imagine there can be any true
election of, and Amity with Christ, unless there be first a divoroe from, and
Abjuration of Self, so far as it stands in opposition to, and competition with
Christ. This is evident even from the universal Idea or general nature of
Friendship. Self-denial, essential to al Friendship.
The Philosopher can tell us, that, (...), Arist. l. 4. c. ^.
they are avaricious, sordid persons, who seek to gain by their friends, to
whom they ought to give, i. e. they, who make self the only measure of their
friendship, are good friends to none but themselves: for you may expect
friendship from them, no longer than they may expect advantage and profit from
you. He that regards himself only, and converts al his thoughts and studies to
his own Interest, is the worst in the world to make a friend of: because he
usually fails his friend most, when he has most need of his friendship; namely,
in times of difficulty. The selfish man will part with his best friend, Self
violates all the laws of friendship.
rather than with his carnal Interest. Yea inordinate, lawless self, will not
stick to offer violence, to all the fundamental and essential Laws of true
Amity, and friendship. For, (1.) Arist. Rhet. l. 2. c. 4.
A friend is to be chosen for himself: i. e. not for what good we are to
receive from him, but for what good we see and enjoy in him: This a selfish man
minds not: he sees nothing desirable in his friend, but what good he receives
from him. (2.) Again, true Amity requires a likeness, yea some kind of unity,
and oneness in principles, humors, dispositions, wills and Affections. But a
selfish man can no longer conform to his friend, than his friend conformes to
his Interest. Irregular self is full of cross principles, humors, dispositions,
and Affections. (3.) The Philosopher, as well as Reason, tells us, that al true
Amity is founded in virtue; and thence, that there is no sound friendship but
among virtuous persons: but now the selfish person knows no virtue, but what
promotes his great Idol self. (4.) Farther, true friendship requires mutual
communion, communication, and resignation of al things. This a selfish person
can no way approve of: mine and Thine are his fundamental Laws: he chooses
rather to enjoy his carnal interest, than his friend: he had much rather break
a thousand times with his friend, than once with carnal self. (5.) Again,
confidence and dependence is essential to true friendship: but a selfish man
has no confident, but self: he can trust his best friends no longer, than he
has trial of them. Jelousie, (...).
suspicion and disbelief is the first Article of his Creed. (6.) True
friendship requires, that we do or suffer any thing for our friend: But now a
selfish person can do but little, and suffer much less for his friend, (7.)
Lastly, Fidelity, and constance is fundamental, and necessary to true Amity:
But alas! how mutable, how inconstant, how disloyal is a selfish man to his
best friends? Hence the Philosopher concludes, (...). Plato, Conviv. fol. 184.
That friendship is not to be taken up for riches or any politic Interest:
because such an Amity has nothing stable in it, but its Instabilitie or
inconstance. And thus much experience tells us, that friendship taken up on base
selfish Interests, is most inconstant: for the least mistakes, prejudices,
cross humors, passions or dissatisfactions often turns such friendship into
secret, if not open enmity. By all which it appears, that they, who enter into
a league of friendship for base selfish ends, will soon come to an end of their
friendship. Whence also it is manifest, that self-denial is essential and
fundamental to al true friendship.

Neither is this self-abnegation fundamentally necessary to human friendship
only, but also to Divine. Self-love Christ's greatest enemy in 7 regards.
Spiritual Amity with Christ is no interessed Love: that lawless Lord, or
rather Tyrant, Self-love is the greatest enemy Christ has. For (1.) whatsoever
pretensions of Amity to Christ it may make, yet the intrinsic and secret
mesure of al its kindness to Christ is self-interest: so much the Philosopher
assures us, (...). Arist.
that the self-lover acts wholly for himself, either according to his proffit
or pleasure. (2.) Again, self-love fills the heart with a world of prejudices
against Christ. O! What unbelieving Jelousies, what groundles surmises, and
suspicions; what cruel, severe, and hard thoughts of Christ have self-seeking
professors? (3.) Whence also comes that obstinacy, contumacie,
stout-heartednes, and inflexibilitie or stubbornes of will, which is in many
pretenders of friendship to Christ, but from proud self? (...). Suidas.
for self is the proudest thing in the world: it affects no less than a
Deity, or equality with God and Christ; and therefore its will must be its
law; it is impatient of any yoke, though never so sweet and easy. (4.)
Self-love is the greatest enemy to Christ, because it is full of
self-flatterie, presumtion, and carnal security. Holy Self-despair is the best
foundation for friendship with Christ; because it makes sinners see and feel
their absolute necessity of Christ. I must have Christ or I die, says the
self-despairing soul. Coecus sui amor hominibu^ persuadet, Nihil odiosum sibi
inesse. Calv.
But now self-love fills the soul with groundles presumtions, and carnal
confidences: if sin be but asleep, or sick, self persuades the sinner, that sin
is dead: if there be but a few seeming good actions, self-love presumes that
there are also good Affections: If there be some legal sorrow for sin, this
affection of self-love falsely concludes, there is an hatred of sin, etc. (5.)
Lawless self is a great bar to friendship with Christ, in that it is the cause
of al sin, and so of difformitie from, and rebellion against Christ. That
self-love is the cause of al sin, the poor blind (...), etc. Plato Leg. 5. f.
731.
Philosopher can instruct us: for (says he) he that loves, is blind about that
he loves; and so he imagines there is greater honor due to himself than truth.
Again, al sin springs from an inordinate appetite of some lower good: and the
true cause why any do inordinately love any lower good is, because they do
inordinately love themselves. Hence (6.) Self-love puts another bar to Divine
Amity with Christ, in that it is the cause of al manner of confusion, and
disorder in the soul. Friendship with Christ, is (as we have before Chap. 2.
shown) a very barmonious, regular, and orderly thing: But now that lawless
Tyrant self breeds al kind of confusion. So Plato excellently philosophiseth,
showing, (...), etc. Plato Repub. 9. fol. 575, -- 577.
how Tyrannick self-love lives, as an absolute Monarch, in all manner of
confusion and irregularitie, etc. (7.) Lastly, lawless self is most
obstructive of Divine Amity with Christ, in that it makes men double minded,
disloyal and unconstant in all the offices and duties of friendship toward
Christ. Self-seeking professors are indeed friends to none but their own
humors, lusts, and Interests: whatever fair pretenses they make to Christ, yet
in truth al their friendship is concluded within their own sphere: self is the
center and circumference, where all the lines terminate. It Is true, they will
perhaps in some lesser concerns, where self is not invaded, appear for Christ,
that so they may in concerns of greater consequence act for themselves: they
live and die within the circle of their own private Interests: they really
adore and worship no God, but self. Whence it is impossible that such, whose
ends differ so vastly from Christ's, should maintain entire, and long
friendship with him. Divine Amity with Christ is lined with a world of
difficulties; and therefore it needs a world of courage and resolution: Cowards
will make no good friends of Christ; because they are below the lowest office of
friendship. But self-love is mighty cowardly and timorous, as also slothful and
lazy: it cries, there is a Lion in the way, if but any shadow of danger. It Is
true, a selfish friend may go, like Orphah with her mother, a furlong or two
with Christ, so long as the way lies fair and direct for his own Interest; but
yet he soon parts at the first cross way. Quia adhuc nimis inordinate te
diligis, ideo plene te resignare aliorum voluntati trepidas, Gerson de Imitat.
Christi, l. 3. c. 13.
One keeps on with Christ til he comes to the cross way of shame or reproach:
another he walks with Christ, til he comes to the cross way of poverty or
need: others march with Christ, til they come to some fiery trial of
persecution. This is most certain, that friendship with Christ, begun on base
selfish grounds, will end in secret or open enmity: for when such seeming
friends have atained their ends on Christ, they care not to have any more to do
with him. We find this fully exemplified in many selfish friends that followed
Christ, while on earth, for the loaves, or bag, or some such carnal interest.
So Joh. 6.15. Joh. 6.15, 26.
there are some seemingly such zealous friends of Christ, as that they would
come and take him by force, and make him a King. Ay but Christ puts no
confidence in them: he knew their selfish design, and upbraids them with it,
v. 26. verily ye seek me because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.
Quos sportula secit amicos. Juven. Sat.
Such basquet-friends are reproched by the Heathens. Neither were they
long-lived-friends of Christ; for v, 60, 61. they are offended at him, and so
quit his company. The like instance we have, Joh. 2.23, 24. where many commit
themselves to Christ, but he would not commit himself to them; because he saw
they were but selfish false-hearted friends, which would ere long prove open
enemies to him. We have also a great instance hereof in zealous Jehu, 2 King.
10.15, 16.
2 King. 10.15, 16. where he seems a forward and hearty friend of God; and
cries out to Jehonadab, come with me and see my zele for the Lord. He pretends
much zealous friendship for God, but he intends al for himself: Jehu seems to go
far in the work of Reformation: oh! what an huge zele has he seemingly for God?
But when it came to the hazard of his Crown, then the golden Calves must he set
up: he would rather venture the loss of Religion, Christ and al, than the
loss of his Kingdom, 2 King. 10.29, 31.
2 King. 10.29, 31. He regarded not to walk in all the commandments of the Lord:
Albeit he went far in Reformation, yet he durst not go farther than his
Interest attended him: when Reformation, and Interest cross each other, Where
self is the cause of friendship, it is also the ruin of the same.
then he breaks with God, and so God breaks with him, as v. 32. And it is worth
our remarque, that the very same self-interest, namely his ambitious desire of
the Kingdom, which made him seem so zealous a friend of God, against Ahab's
house, was that which at last turned his seeming friendship into open emnitie
against God. For the same self-interest that engaged him for God, against
Ahab's family, in order to the obtaining of the Kingdom, engaged him against
God, and a through Reformation, lest thereby he should again lose the Kingdom:
which seems to be aimed at, Hos. 7.1. Hos. 7.1.
when I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered,
and the wickedness of Samaria. Jehu's ambition was very well pleased, to join in
the work of Reformation, so far as it conduced to his gaining of the Kingdom:
but having gained it, the same self-love hindered him from joining too far in
Reformation, lest thereby he should again lose his Kingdom. Thus the same
Idol-self, which at first made him a seeming friend, at last made him an open
enemy to God. So mutable and variable a thing is self, and al friendship
founded, and rolling thereon. And, as Ambitious self thus far prevailed with
Jehu, so Avaricious or covetous self no less influenced Judas, both in the
election, and reprobation of Christ, as his friend: For the same avaricious
humor, which made him continue a friend of Christ, namely that he might have
his bag or purse supplied, (for Judas was Christ's Bursar, as Joh. 13.29.) the
same at last inclined him to sell his master and friend, for thirty pieces of
Silver. Such a visible curse is there upon al selfish friendship, as that
self-love is both the effective, and destructive cause thereof. By all which it
is evidently manifest, that inordinate self is the Gangrene of al true
friendship: so that nothing is more essential and fundamental to the election
of Christ as our friend, than the Reprobation, abnegation and abjuration of
tyrannick, lawles self. Renunciation of sin, without the renunciation or
rejection of self, does but make men more secret, and cunning enemies of Christ.

And as there can be no espousement of Christ for our friend, A character of
hypocritick, partial self-denial.
'til there be a divorce from self; so neither is it every partial,
superficial, carnal, externe, legal, and hypocritick self-denial that will serve
the turn, to constitute a sincere friendship with Christ. For it is most
evident, that many deny themselves in some things, As to 1. Self-wisdom.
that so they may seek themselves more effectually in other-some. Others deny
themselves much in profession; that so they may exalt themselves the more in
Realitie. Some seemingly abase their own wisdom, that so they may the more
cunningly advance the same; as the Academicks, and Scepticks of old. 2.
Self-humor.
Others professedly cross and thwart their own Inclinations, and humors, that
so they may promote their own merits. 3. Self-merit.
Others renounce their own merits and self-righteousnes in profession, that so
they may the more establish the same in their hearts. 4. The causes of
self-denial. 1. From self-love.
How much seeming self-abnegation is there in the world, which springs only
from self-love? How many are there who seem to abase themselves in their own,
and the worlds eyes, that so they may be extolled by other men? does not many
men's self-denial spring only from carnal fear of Divine wrath; 2. From carnal
fear, or, 3. Spiritual pride. 5. Its effects.
or from spiritual pride and vain glory? is not the self-denial of many made
use of only, as an artificial blind, or masque to cover over a rotten base
heart? do'nt they under a form of self-abnegation, hide the power of lust? Is
not the self-denial of many seeming friends of Christ only legal and forced;
which at last ends in greater self-seeking and Apostasy? certainly, such
self-denial is the pest of Religion, mere carnalitie, enmity against God; yea
flat Idolatry; and therefore the greatest abomination unto God: so far is it
from laying a foundation for Divine Amity with Christ.

Whence it appears that that self-denial, An Idea of true self-denial which
springs from a spiritual sight of our selves, and of God.
which ushers in friendship with Christ, is of a more noble descent, and
nature: it springs from a broad, inward, spiritual, intuitive, feeling, living,
and Divine light; discovering to the soul the universal pravitie, contagion,
malignitie, poverty, nakedness, impotence, servitude, yea Hell of sin, and
misery in corrupt Nature. This Divine light gives the soul also a bright,
spiritual, real, intuitive, affective apprehension of the Justice, Purity,
Majesty, and Glory of God; which makes the sinner much more vile and
loathsome in his own eyes; as it was with Esaias, chap. 6.5. Esa. 6.5.
who, having had a sight of God in his Glory, v. 1. he cries out, woe is me,
for I am undone, etc. This is the proper Genius and Spirit of Christ's friends;
the more real, and lively discoveries they have of the glory of Christ, the
more they loath, and abhor themselves, as not meet to come into the presence of
Christ. Thus also Job, chapter 40. v. 4. Behold I am vile, what shall I answer thee?
I will lay mine hand upon my mouth. So Job 42.5. I have heard of thee by the
hearing of the ear: but now mine eye sees thee. What follows? v. 6. Wherefore
I abhor my self, and repent in dust and ashes. Job, having had a glimpse of the
Lords glory, he looks upon himself as most loathsome and abominable: he is not
only ashamed of, and grieved for his sin, but he loathes himself as one quite
out of heart; he abhors himself as an unclean and abominable thing. And this is
the sweet and gracious temper of every friend of Christ; so far as he sees the
glory of Christ, so far he loathes himself: the more highly he estimes, and
affects Christ, the more deeply he disestimes, and disaffects himself: yea, he
abhors himself so much, as that he would fain be severed from himself, and
never own himself more: he looks upon himself as fit rather to be swallowed up
of judgment, than capable of mercy; he is quite out of conceit, and love with
himself. Thus also the Publican; who having had some glimpse of Gods justice
and holiness, Luke 18.13. Luke 18.13.
(1.) He stands afar off: which argues a lively sense of his infinite distance
from God. (2.) He would not lift up his eyes to Heaven, as deeply sensible of
his own unworthines. (3.) But smote upon his breast, etc. as conscious of his
own wretched sinful state and condition. Such a deep lively sight, and sense of
self-nothingnes, yea of self-hel, brings the soul to an holy and happy
self-despair; which is an effectual door to faith and friendship with Christ.
Such a self-despairing soul is really nothing in his own eyes, though he hopes
to be something by Divine vouchsafement: His own wisdom, As to 1.
Self-wisdom, and presumtion.
which perhaps he sometimes idolized, is now to him mere folly, Gal. 6.3. His
old self-presumtions, and self-flatteries are, in his estime now, as the Gates
and Suburbs of Hell: he would not for a world be his own flatterer: he desires
to be sifted to the bran, that so he might know the worst of his state. As for
self-wil, 2. Self-wil.
he looks upon it as no better than a self-hel: he accounts his own will the
most crooked, stubborn, perverse piece of the whole Creation; and therefore
would fain have it broken and ground to powder; wholly melted and dissolved
into the will of God, Psalm. 131.2. 3. Self-forces.
His self-forces, and self-strength, he judges to be wholly infirm, and weak:
and whereas formerly, his evangelick assistances were improved for the Interest
of self; and under pretense of depending on Christ, he really depended on
himself; he now abjures al self-dependence, and counts al his strength to lie
in his self-weaknes, so far as it leads him to more complete and absolute
dependence on Christ, 2 Cor. 12.10. As for his self-righteousnes, 4.
Self-righteousnes.
he looks upon it as most unrighteous; yea, as dung and dross in comparison of
Christ, 5. Self-peace.
Phil. 3.8, 9. His self-peace and security, is that which he daily watches and
fights against. 6. Self-interest.
His carnal self-interest, is to him no better than self-ruine. His self-glorie
is his self-shame, 7. Self-glorie.
and reproach. Thus is the true self-denying friend nothing in himself, that so
he may be something in Christ: he is a fool in himself that he may be wise in
Christ: he is poor in himself, that he may be rich in Chist: he is naked in
himself, that he may be clothed with Christ's white raiment: he is weak in
himself that he may be strong in Christ: he is lost in himself, that he may be
found in Christ: he is despairing in himself, that he may believe in Christ: he
dies in himself, that he may live in Christ. Thus the friend of Christ abjures
self in every branch, and vein thereof, and places Christ in the room of self:
he turns that great Idol, that whorish creature self out at doors; and takes
in Christ, his soverain Lord, to loge al alone in the Bent of his conjugal love
and desires: He turns my self into Christ-self; my wit into Christ's wisdom,
my will into Christ's will; my strength into Christ's omnipotence; mine ease into
Christ's pleasure; my credit into Christ's honor; mine interest into Christ's
exaltation. Thus he abandons, and dies to private, particular, irregular self;
that he may possess, enjoy, admire, desire, hope for, delight in, and live
upon his most universal, generous, noble, laudable, and best self, Christ. This
is that happy self-denial, which is so fundamental and essential to friendship
with Christ: For he that can thus deny himself, will never deny his Lord, and
friend, he that has thus overcome himself, will with ease overcome al
difficulties, that lie in his way to Christ. The greatest conflicts the friends
of Christ have, is with lawless, tyrannick self. This is that which ruins al
false friends of Christ: for how many have very far overcome sin, and yet after
al have been overcome by self? and among those that seem to deny themselves,
how many seek themselves most, while they seem most to deny themselves? O
happy is he, that understands what it is to abjure, Beatus q^^ intelligit quid
sit amare Christum and contemnere scips^m. Gerson, de Imit. Christi.
contemn, and abandon self, and espouse Christ as his friend. Nothing makes
men more uniforme, familiar, confident, officious, intimate, and loyal friends
of Christ, than such a genuine, pure strain and vein of self-denial. What made
Abraham so eminent for friendship with God, as that he is styled, with an
emphase or accent, The Friend of God? Was it not his self-abnegation, Abraham's
friendship with God founded on self-denial.
that laid so good a foundation for his so great Amity with God? Were not all the great and noble exploits of Abraham's friendship with God, founded on
self-denial? His first great act of friendship toward God, for which he is
styled, Esa. 41.2, 8. the friend of God, consisted, in his forsaking Chaldea,
his nearest relations, and eye-pleasing delights to follow God, he knew not
whither, as a Pilgrim, al his days. Was not this an high piece of
self-abjuration? Again, the second great Act of friendship, for which he is
recognized, and openly proclaimed the friend of God, James 2.23. was his
offering up his only Son Isaac. And, O! what a world of self-denial, was there
in this Act? I might run through that little Book of Martyrs,, Other
Scripture-instances. Heb. 11.
or white roll of Christ's Confessors, and friends, Hebrews 11. and discover
unto you what visible veins of self-denial ran through al their friendship
toward God. For faith, which was the soul and life of their friendship, is the
greatest self-denier in the World. Do but, in your meditations (which is too
large a Theme for me) run over those noble friends of Christ, there mentioned,
even from Abel, to the end of the Chapter, and you will see pure, and high strains
of self-denial, which were the chief corner stones of their confidence in, and
friendship with God in Christ. Again, let us contemplate Christ's New Testament
friends, and we shall find much of self-renunciation at the bottom of al their
Amity with Christ. Was not John Baptist a rare, John Baptist's friendship with
Christ grounded on self-denial.
choice friend of Christ? and who more eminent for self-denial than he;
especially when it came it came to a competition with Christ? Mat. 3.11.
So Mat. 3.11. he confesses he was not worthy to bear Christs's Shoes. Joh. 3
26, 30.
But more particularly, John 3.26 -- 30. v. 26. Some of John's Disciples, seem
much offended, that Christ had more Disciples than he: whereupon John, v. 27,
28. rebukes them: and v. 29. declares solemnly, that for his part, he was but
the friend of Christ, the Bridegroom; and therefore 'twas joye enough for him
to hear his voice. Yea, adds he, v. 30. He must increase, but I must decrease.
As if he had said: Let my name lie in the dust, and rot, sobeit that his name
be exalted, and made glorious: let me be disgraced and despised, provided that
he be dignified, and extolled: let my root wither and dry away, so that his
branch may flourish: let my Sun set, and be turned into a black cole, that his
Sun may shine forth more brightly: not my Kingdom, but his Kingdom come: let
me be nothing, so that he may be al things. These are noble strains of
self-denying friendship. I might show you the like in other Evangelick friends
of Christ; as the Thief on the Cross, Luke 23.42. and Paul, who, Romans 9.3.
seems content to suffer an innocent and sinlesse Hell, for the interest of his
Lord: and every where, when he speaks of himself, he draws a veil over his own
excellences, that so Christ's glory might shine forth more conspicuously: as
Gal. 2.20. Yet not I but Christ lives in me: that modest corrective [not I]
argues much self-denying friendship. But I must contract. By these and the like
exemplifications and instances, we see, what an essential, and fundamental
connection there is, betwixt self-denial, and Friendship with Christ. I shall
close this particular with an observation of the Philosopher; (...). Arist.
Rhet. l. 1. c. 1.
who notes, that young men usually are more [(...)] friendly, and sociable,
than other ages; because they rejoice in society, and mind not their profit,
or self-interest; as friends ought not. The reason holds good in all friendship,
and the observation very far in friendship amongst men; because, the elder men
grow, usually, if they are not clothed with a Divine nature, the more selfish
they are. But it is quite contrary in Divine friendship with Christ: Young
Christians, though they often have the largest affections for Christ, yet have
they the least friendship toward him: and the reason is, because there is much
of self in all their Affections and duties: they mind more what they receive
from Christ, than what they give unto him: they love Christ in themselves, more
than themselves in Christ: whereas grown, and mature Christians, though perhaps
their Affections, and friendship to Christ be not so juicy and sappy, yet are
they more spiritual and less selfish: they love Christ now more for what good
is in himself, than for what good they receive from him: and whereas at first,
they loved Christ for themselves, they now love themselves in and for Christ:
the more they are acquainted with Christ, the more they love him for himself;
which is the purest strain of freindship.

Thus we see how essential self-denial is both to the Being, and Perfection of
al friendship, and particularly of Divine.

SECT. 4. How far the World must be reprobated, in order to the Election of
Christ as our friend.
3. How far the World is to be rejected, in order to the Election of Christ as
our friend.
WE have finished the two great interne competitors of Christ, sin, and self; we
now proceed to the externe corrivals of Christ; which are the World, and the
Law. These are not formally, and in themselves enemies to Christ, but only
objectively, and indirectly, as they, by their frowns or smiles, inveigle, and
entice the heart away from Christ. We shall therefore examine them more
cursorily, and begin with the World; which is so far to be rejected, as it
stands in opposition to, or competition with Christ. The world has a double
face, the one smiling, and the other frowning: by the former it endeavors to
allure, by the latter it strives to terrify the soul from Christ. In both
these respects the World must be denied; though principally as to the former:
For generous spirits, are sooner overcome by the smiles, than by the frowns of
the World. 1. The Allurements of the World.
As for the Allurements and blandissements of the World, they are very
bewitching and heart-inveigling things. Al things in excess are hurtful; but
the intemperance of prosperity is most dangerous. Magnam so turam magnus
animus decet: qui risi se ad illam extulit and altior steti^, illam quoqu^
infra terram dedu^it. Seneca.
He need have a great mesure of Grace, who has great worldly enjoyments: for if
his heart be not much above them, with God; he will be soon brought under, and
made a slave by them. The world, albeit it promise fair, is very faithless,
and deceitful: it usually then deceives us most, when we most love, or trust
it. Nothing makes men sooner mad, than to be drunk with too much felicity. Our
Heads, and Hearts are so weak and infirm, as that they are soon overcome with
the sweet wine of worldly good. And therefore, he that will be a friend of
Christ, needs much wisdom, and Christian Temperance, as to the Desire, Use,
and Fruition of these lower goods. The Philosopher says, in down right terms,
(...). Plato.
that it is impossible to be exceeding rich, and exceeding good. Which comes near
our Lord's great Aphorism, That it is impossible for a rich man to enter into
the Kingdom of Heaven, i. e. as it is explained, for one that trusts in his
riches; which is the usual practice of rich men; who therefore are most unfit
to make friends of Christ. Certainly great confluences of inferior goods, are
great impediments to friendship with Christ: Because they make men usually (1.)
Very (...). Arist. Rhet. l. 2. c. 19.
proud. (2.) Very soft-natured, and unable to bear, and manage the cross. (3.)
Very voluptuous and sensual. (4.) Very formal, dead-hearted and strangers to
God, in all their ways. (5.) Very confident in themselves. (6.) Very earthy and
base-minded. Which are al very obstructive to friendship with Christ. We have
sufficifient instances hereof, in those who pretended friendship to Christ. So
the young man, Mat. 19.21, Mat. 19.21, 22.
22. what kept him from closing with Christ, but his possessions? he had rather
part with Christ, than with his riches. He that will make Christ his friend must
ungod the World. Now the Worlds Deity, or, if you will, Trinity consists in
the Lusts of the flesh, the lusts of the eye, and the pride of life, as 1 John
2.16. 1 John 2.16.
i.e. according to the usual explication, the act being (by reason of its near
alliance) set for the object, Sensual pleasures, Riches, and Honors: Which, as
the Cynick wittily expresses it, (...). Diogen. Cyn.
are the masks of Vices; yea, and the fuel of them. So Philo the Jew tells us,
Philo in Decalog.
That all sin comes from the lust after pleasures, or riches, or glory. These
therefore must be so far rejected, as they stand in competition with Christ.
Thus Christ enjoines the young man Matthew. 19.21. Mat. 19.11.
Go and sell what thou have and give to the poor. Christ commands him to part
with all, if he would partake of him. To part with all; why, or how so? (1.)
Every friend of Christ must part with all habitually, in the habitual frame and
bent of his heart: Christ must be loved more than al: thence the friends of
Christ are required to hate al in comparison of Christ: that is, to love al
with a lesser love which is comparative hatred. This the young man came short
in: for he loved his riches more than Christ, as v. 22. (2.) The friend of
Christ must part with all actually when Christ calls for it: which Christ does in
some cases; As 1. In those first times of the Gospel, Christ required that his
friends should lay down al at his feet, and live on a commun stock: and
therefore it was this young man's sin, that he would not obey Christ's command,
and part with all at his injunction: which was also the sin of Ananias and
Saphira; and it cost them their lives. Again, 2. Christ commands his friends to
part actually with all; so far as his Churches shall need require it, for the
maintaining of his worship and ordinances. Which seems the meaning of that
Scripture, Gal. 6.6, 7, 8. Be not deceived, God is not mocqued, for what a man
sows, that also shall he reap, etc. His design is to instruct us, that we may
not grudge any thing to Christ, for the maintaining of his Worship. 3. We are
actually to part with all for Christ, so far as it may stand in competition with
Christ, which often happens in times of Persecution: we must lose al to keep
Christ and a good Conscience. So our Lord informs us, Mat. 6.24.
Mat. 6.24. No man can serve two masters -- ye cannot serve God and Mammon, i.
e. as Chrysostom paraphraseth on these words, (...). Chrysostom.
no one can serve God and Mammon; because they require opposite things: Christ
commands that we part with what we have, Mammon commandt that we catch at what
we have not. There is also an emphase in that notion, serve; which implies to
be under the Dominion, and to depend on the beck of those we serve. He that is
under the Dominion of Christ, as his husband and friend, must use the World as
his servant, not as his friend or Lord. In brief, How the World is to be used
in subordination to Christ.
the right use of the World, in subordination to our friendship with Christ,
consists in these particulars, (1.) In all creature-goods, to have a single
intention on, and pure Affection for Christ, as our chiefest good, and best
friend. This Christ injoines in the forecited Scripture, Mat. 6.22. if the
eye, [ i. e. the Intention] be single, the whole body is full of light. To the
friends of Christ, the whole World should be but a glass, wherein they see and
enjoy Christ their friend. (2.) There must be moderation in the use of al
creature comforts, and contentation in the loss of them. Al sensible goods are
to the friends of Christ, but things indifferent; and therefore they must use
them indifferently: they must learn, with Paul, Phil. 4.12. Phil. 4.12.
to want in all their abundance, and to abound in all their wants. What is
wanting in their provision, they must make up by contentment; and what is over
or abundant, they must, by Christian moderation and charity, learn to want.
(3.) The friends of Christ must use things to be used; and enjoy things to be
enjoyed, i. e. they must use the World as their servant, and enjoy Christ as
their friend. For he that makes the World his friend, makes Christ his enemy.
Jam. 4.4.
So Jam. 4.4. Know ye not, that the friendship of the world is enmity with
God? etc. so irreconcilable is the feud 'twixt Christ and the World, when they
come in competition, as that he who is a friend of the World must needs be an
enemy to Christ; and he that is a friend to Christ, is necessarily engaged to
be an enemy to the World. How far the friends of Christ must reject the frowns
of the World, we intend to show, God willing, when we come to their duty as to
bearing Christ's Cross.

SECT. 5. How far Divorce from the Law is pre-requisite, to the Espousement of
Christ as our friend.
4. How far the Law is to be rejected in order to the espousement of Christ.
WE now proceed to the last grand competitor with Christ, namely The Law; which
is not simply, and absolutely an enemy to Christ, but only so far, as under
the notion of an Husband, or Covenant of works, it sues for a share in that
conjugal faith and friendship, which is due to Christ alone. Now the Law
endeavors to enter into the same bed with Christ, or to gain our conjugal
friendship, both by its frowns and smiles, i. e. by its threats, and promises.
(1.) The Law, especially when set home by the spirit of bondage, by its threats
and terrors, affrightens and pricks the sinner's Conscience. Then (2.) by its
fair promises and offers of life, it presses hard for the souls conjugal faith
and friendship. But (3.) it being impossible for the sinner to perform exact
obedience to the Law, therefore the Law is content, to go sharer with Christ;
that the soul do what ^t can, and then, that its imperfections be made up by
the perfect righteousness of Christ. Thus the Law is content to compound with
Christ, and that its covenant ^f works O^era tincta sanguine Christi. Bellarm.
be tinctured with Christ's blood, and mixed with the covenant of Grace: and by
this means it gains the consent and conjugal friendship of many poor awakened
sinners. A mixed covenant of Law and Christ, Works and Grace is very commun,
but most dangerous. Thus it prevailed with the Judaizing Galatians, who
compounded matters between the Law and Christ, and so admitted both into the
same conjugal bed of Faith and Dependence; which the Apostle calls the joining
the bondwoman, and the freewoman together, Notes of fouls married to the Law.
Gal. (...) 30, 31. and chapter 5.2, 3, 4. And that this (...) the case of
multitudes of convinced sinners, is evident (1.) From their legal performances
of duties, merely to satisfy and quiet conscience, not to please and satisfy
Christ. (2.) From their employing, and improving Gospel-assistances for the
promoting of legal, self-righteousnes. (3.) From their seeking after support
and comfort from duties performed, rather than from Christ in duties. (4.) From
their fear o^ displeasing the Law, more than of displeasing Christ. (5.) From
their making use of their legal performances, and righteousness only as a cover
blind or masque to concels a rotten heart, or some base lusts. These are black
characters of a soul married to the Law, Romans 7.1, etc. But now the soul^ that
enters into a covenant of conjugal friendship with Christ, Christ's friends dead
to the Law, and how.
is divorced from, and dead unto the Law, as an Husband, or covenant of Works;
and as i^ is a (...). Plato.
rigorous Tyrant, which requires perfect, exact obedience, and curses all that
perform it not; or as it would share with Christ in our conjugal Affections.
This the Apostle professedly declares, Romans 7.1, 2, Romans 7.1, 2, 3, 4.
3, 4. v. 1. etc. he shows how the Law has Dominion over sinners, so long as
they are married to it, and out of Christ. But, adds he v. 4. ye are become
dead to the law by the body of Christ, that ye should be married to another, i.
e. being by faith united and married to Christ, ye owe no conjugal faith and
friendship to the Law, which was your old husband; no, you are now dead to it
as a covenant; you are not obnoxious to its curses; neither are you obliged to
give it conjugal benevolence, or to bring forth children to it: for ye are
married to Christ, that ye should bring forth Fr^ctus vocat liberos. Beza.
fruit, [i. e. children] unto God. Al your duties now must not be to please and
satisfy the Law, as your husband, but to please and satisfy Christ: neither
must you by your performances endeavor to exalt the righteousness of the Law as
a Covenant, Gal. 4.30, 31.
but Christ. The like Gal. 4.30, 31. where he tells them, they must cast out the
bondwoman, i. e. the Law, as a Covenant, and embrace the freewoman, i. e. the
Covenant of Grace. Yet this hinders not, The friends of Christ love the Law as
a Directorie.
but that the friends of Christ are obliged to love and observe the Law, as a
Directorie and Instructor, to regulate and guide them in their walking: Yea, in
this regard their hearts have an intimate union with the Law; they would fain,
as two strait lines, touch in every point with the Law; they hug, and embrace
it, because it is but a reflexe Image, a Transcript or copy of the holiness of
Christ, their best friend. Whereas the false friends of Christ, embrace the Law
as an Husband, or Covenant of Works, but hate it as a Directorie, or rule of
life: the true friends of Christ, they reprobate, yea hate the Law as a
Covenant of Works, and yet embrace, and love it as a Directorie, and rule of
life. These differing and opposite Affections, in the false and true friends of
Christ, proceed from the differing and opposite regards they have to the law
and Christ. The false friend of Christ, his last end is to exalt himself, and
therefore he espouseth the Law for his Husband, that so he might bring forth
fruit to himself, and exalt his own righteousness: The true friend of Christ,
his last end is to abase Self, and exalt Christ, and therefore he rejects the
Law as a Covenant, and espouseth Christ for his husband, that so he may bring
forth fruit to God, and exalt his free grace. Whence the Law, being stripped of
its bitter, and sour curses, and dipped in the blood of Christ; as also
sweetened with free grace and Gospel-mercie; it now becomes a sweet and easy
evangelick-yoke, a new commandment of love, a royal Law of liberty; which
with his inward man he delights in, and loves to conform unto, as Romans 7.22.
Jam. 1.25.

Thus we have finished the first character of the object; and shown, how Christ
is singly to be chosen, in opposition to Sin, Self, the World, and Law. Al of
which are comprehended in the character of the good Merchant, Mat. 13.46.
Mat. 13.46. who sold all that he had, and bought the pearl of precious price:
he sold Sin, and Self, and the World, and the Law, so far as they stood in
opposition to, or competition with Christ. He that holds fast any of these,
when Christ calls for them, lets go Christ. He that forsakes not al for Christ,
will soon forsake Christ, when there is any hazard of his poor Al, and therefore
Christ will never own such as a true friend. So far as the Heart is clung to any
of these as corrivals of Christ, so far it is an enemy, not a friend to Christ.

CHAP. IV. The Election of Whole Christ; both Offices, Person, Spirit, Ways,
Members, and Cross.
SECT. 1. A complete Christ must be elected by his Friends.
A Second consideration of Christ, A complete Christ the object of the Saints
friendship.
as he is the object of his friends Election, is, that he be completely chosen.
It will not suffice to constitute a real Amity with Christ, that he be singly,
unless he be also completely elected: For Christ is made useless, yea an
enemy to us, not only by addition of something to him, but also by
substraction, or diminution of something from him. As we may not therefore add
either sin, or self, or world, or Law to Christ; so neither may we substract or
withdraw any thing from Christ. A divided, as well as a compound, Christ, is but
an imaginary friend, or rather real enemy to us. Wherefore he that will really
make Christ his friend, must elect him completely as well as singly. Now to
choose Christ completely imports two things. 1. To choose whole Christ: And 2. To
choose whole Christ for himself. Of these in their order, First, 1. The friends
of Christ must elect a whole Christ.
Those who will contract an Amity with Christ, must elect, or choose whole
Christ. Though I cannot, as yet, satisfy mine own thoughts with that
persuasion, which supposes, justifying faith as such, and under that
reduplication, to regard Christ as Lord and King, as well as Priest: because
this is, as I conceive with submission, to confound the differing forms of
faith, as justifying and as sanctifying; whereof the former speaks a relation
to Christ as Priest, the latter to Christ as King chiefly. Besides, I have not
as yet any sufficient reason, which might persuade me to quit that received
opinion, That faith justifies as an Instrument; not physic, but moral, or
rather federal, depending wholly on the institution of God: and hence not as an
Active, but Passive, or Receptive and Applicative Instrument, whereby the
Righteousness of Christ is received, and made ours: Though I cannot, I say, for
these, and such like considerations force my mind to assent, that justifying
faith as such, regards Christ as Lord and King; yet I easily grant, yea shall
demonstrate, that sanctifying faith, which is one great ligament or essential
bond of the souls friendship with Christ, closes with whole Christ, as well
Prophet and King, as Priest, etc.

SECT. 2. The friends of Christ must Elect him as their King.
1. 1. The friends of Christ must elect him as King.
THE true friend of Christ does espouse him not only as Jesus, a Savior, but
also as Christ an anointed King: he elects Christ, not only as a Priest to
deliver him from Hell, but also as a King to deliver him from his lusts. To take
Christ only to save us from wrath, and not to save us from sin, is a black
character of a rotten heart, and false friend. Joh. 1.11.
So Joh. 1.11. He came unto his own, and his own received him not. He came unto
his own: i. e. Christ came to the Jews, who pretended great friendship to the
Messiah, and therefore when they heard he was come, oh! how were they overjoyed
at so good news? how do they rejoice and sport themselves in the light of his
Gospel, as Joh. 5.35. what Hosanna's and Songs of deliverance do they sing,
Mat. 21.9.15. Joh. 12.13? How greedy are they to make him their King? Joh.
6.15. How is it said then, that they received him not? why they received him
not as (...); non receperunt illum ut Dominum, Grot. in locum.
Lord and King, to rule over them, and destroy their lusts. They could be
content to receive him as a Savior, to deliver them from their enemies, the
Romans; as also from the wrath of a sin-revenging God; such tidings were very
joyous to them; but when Christ comes to convince them of, and rebuke them for
their unbelief, hypocrisy, pride, formalitie, and other great Abominations, O,
then they would hear no more of him; away with him, he was not for their turn.
Thus they received him not as Lord and King. But then he adds, v. 12. But as
many as received him, to them he gave power to become the sons of God, i. e.
Those who received whole Christ, as Lord and King, as well as Savior, those he
dignified with the title of sons and friends. The friends of Christ must
bespeak him in this, or such like language: Lord here is an inflexible, stiff,
hard, perverse, stubborn, obstinate, stout, proud heart; will thou bend, melt,
meeken, soften, stoop, and humble it, by thy royal Scepter and Sovereign Grace?
shall it be made flexible, pliable, and conformable to thy royal will and
pleasure? Again, Lord here are inordinate, tumultuous, rebellious Affections;
which love what they should hate, and hate what they should love; which hope
what they should fear, and fear what they should hope, etc. Now, good Lord,
will thou subdue these thy lawless enemies? shall they, by the power of thy
Grace, have a sweet Harmony, Uniformity, and Order infused into them? may it
please thee to enable me to love what thou love; to hate what thou hate,
etc? Farther; Lord, here are many spiritual refined lusts; here is an Hell of
Atheism, unbelief, presumption, carnal-securitie, self-love, spiritual pride,
carnal confidence, formalitie, hypocrisy, etc. Will thou, dear Lord, wash thy
feet in the blood of these thine Adversaries? Shall thy garments be died red in
their blood? Lastly; O Lord, thou see here is a wretched, cursed old man, a
body of sin, a root of bitterness, a tyrannick lawless Law of rebellion, an
envenomed poisoned fountain of sin, a corrupt nature dwelling in me; may it now
please thee to nail it to thy cross, to pierce it thorough, with the spear of
thy Spirit, that so its heart-blood may issue forth, as it sometime made thine
to gush forth? Thus the friends of Christ must elect him to be Lord, and King,
over their lusts, as well as persons. As for those who pretend to be friends of
Christ, but yet are not willing to have their lusts slain by him, Christ
pronounces an heavy doom against such, Luke 19.27. But those mine enemies
which would not that I should reign over them, Plutarch in the Life of ^y^^rgus.
bring hither and slay them before me. The Soveraigntie and Interest of a
Prince consists chiefly in his wisdom and sufficience to govern: for the
faithful obedience of the subjects depends much upon the wisdom and
sufficience of their Prince: he that governs well, is usually well obeyed. As the
Art of a good Rider is to make his horse flexible, and tractable: even so the
Wisdom of a good King consists in teaching his subjects to obey. This
King-craft, or Regal-wisdome is transcendently, and incomparably in Christ: and
hence it is, that his subjects and friends so willingly and cheerfully elect
him for their King, Psalm. 110.3. Thy people shall be willing, or willingnesses,
etc.

SECT. 3. Christ's friends elect him as their Priest.
2. 2. Christ's friends choose him for their Priest.
CHrist's friends elect him as their Priest. They own no other purgatory of
sins guilt, but the blood of Christ; no other Intercessor, at the Throne of
Grace, but the Lamb of God. (...). Plato, Conviv. fol. 188.
The blind Philosopher could see and acknowledge thus much, that al Sacrifices
were to conciliate or breed, Reconciliation, Amity and communion betwixt God
and men. Whence he makes this the main office of the Pagan Demons, Touching
this office of the Pagan Demons to conciliate friendship betwixt God and men,
See more largely, Court of the Gentiles, P. 1. B. 2. c. 8. s. 5. page 225.
to transmit the Sacrifices of men to the Gods, and the rewards of the Gods to
men. And, because they were sensible of a greater guilt in sin, than could be
washed off by the blood of Bulls, and Goats, or such like sacrifices, therefore
they endeavored to pacify their angry Deities by The custom of the Gentiles
to pacify their Gods by human Sacrifices, See Court of the Gent. Part. 1. B.
2. c. 9. s. 9. page 264, etc.
Human Sacrifices; which custom, peradventure, took place amongst them, from
some broken Traditions they had received, touching the true Messiah and his
Sacrifick, or Priestly Office. But whatever their blind apprehensions were, it
is most certain, the friends of Christ elect no other Sacrificer, or Priest to
make reconciliation, and mediate an Amity betwixt them and God, than Christ
himself. They expect no Act of Oblivion for their offenses past, but what is
procured by his blood: no friendship and communion with God for time to come,
but what this their friend Christ, who is at Gods right hand, and has his ear
to command, by his Interpellation, or Intercession, obtains for them. They
transmit al their Petitions by Christ's hands to God the Father, and expect
God's gracious returns, and vouchsafements, to be transmitted to them, by the
same hands. The friends of Christ look upon his Sacerdotal office or Priesthood
as the most perfect. Heb. 5.6.
So Heb. 5.6. Thou art a Priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec. Who
this Melchisedec was, is much disputed: Cunaeus de Repub. Hebr. l. 3. c. 3.
Philo de Allegor. per M^l hisedecum figurat (...). Grot. in Hebr. 7.3.
A learned man makes him to be Christ himself, appearing to Abraham under an
human shape: whoever he were, it is most certain Christ's Priesthood, expressed
hereby, is most perfect: so v. 9. and being made perfect, he became the Author
of Salvation unto al them that obey him, i. e. to al his friends. The design
of this sacred penman is to set forth the precelience or preference of Christ's
Priesthood before that of Aaron: which he demonstrates, (1.) From the
excellence of Christ's person, who was without sin. (2.) From the prelation of
his Ministration: Christ offered for his people only, Aaron for himself also.
(3.) From the Sacrifice offered: Aaron offered the blood of Bulls, etc. but
Christ offered himself: he was both Sacrificer, and Sacrifice, and Altar. (4.)
From Christ's compassion toward those, for whom he offered himself, etc. These
and such like considerations engage the friends of Christ to Elect him, and him
alone as their Priest. And in as much as the Sacrificature, Christ's friends
choose him, 1. To expiate for their sins.
or Priesthood of Christ confists of two parts, his Expiation or atonement on
earth, and his Intercession in Heaven: his friends elect him for their Priest,
in both these regards; both to expiate for their sins, and to intercede for
them in Heaven: So Heb. 1.3. As to the first part of Christ's oblation, his
friends elect him both for their Sacrificer, their Sacrifice, and their Altar.
(...). Plat. Def. fol. 4, 5.
A Sacrifice is a victime given unto God. And the formal reason or essence of
an expiaatorie Sacrifice, consists in the sprinkling of blood, Heb. 9.22.
Because, according to that ancient law of God given to Noah, Genesis 9.4. blood
passes for the soul, which, in Brutes, is conveyed in the blood. Wherefore
the friends of Christ have their eyes and faith wholly fixed on the blood of
Christ, and on that alone for the pardon of their sin: they thirst after his
death and blood as the life and food of their souls. So in like manner do they
elect Christ as their alone Intercessor with God: 2. To intercede for them.
they expect no returns of their petitions, but what comes by him.

SECT. 4. The Election of Christ as a Prophet essential to friendship with him.
3. Election of Christ as Prophet.
CHrist is to be elected, by his friends as their Prophet. The (...), etc.
Plato, conviv. fol. 188.
Philosopher tells us, That the Prophetic Art was to conciliate, or beget a
friendship betwixt the Gods and men. What he fondly conceits of the Pagan black
Prophetic Art, is most true of Christ's prophetic office; the grand design
whereof is, to bring sinners to a knowledge of, and Amity with God. Alas! why
is it that men, who are rational creatures, are so great enemies to God, the
first Truth and last good? is not this the true reason, because men are borne,
(...), mad fools? Tit. 3.3. They cannot apprehend those transcendent, ravishing
perfections that are in God: there is no adequation or proportion between their
carnal hearts and God's spiritual excellences; and therefore no marvel that
they affect not to make God their friend. But now the friends of Christ, being
sensible of this their native blindness, they elect Christ as their Prophet and
conductor to instruct them in the things of God. Joh. 10.4.
So Joh. 10.4. And he goes before them: and the sheep follow him; for they
know his voice. Christ alludes to the custom of those countries, where the
Shepherd was wont to go before his sheep, and calling them by a peculiar note,
which they were accustomed to, they cheerfully followed him: So Christ's
friends, who are his sheep, having elected him for their great Shepherd, they,
understanding his dialect or voice, follow him as their Guide. The like, Joh.
14.6.
Joh. 14.6. I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life, etc. As if he had said; why,
follow me: for I am the true way to life. Gerson de Imitat. Christi. l. 3. c.
56.
Without a Way a man cannot go; without Truth a man cannot know where to go;
without Life a man is never the better for going. I am the way, which thou
ought to follow; the truth which thou oughest to believe; the life, which
thou ought to hope for. I am the Way inviolable, the Truth infallible, the
Life interminable or endless. I am the most strait way, the most supreme
Truth, the most perfect life. Thus the friends of Christ elect him for their
Prophet, and counselor: they understand his Dialect or language, and therefore
follow him, the true way to life; but a stranger they will not follow, as Joh.
10.5. But now the false friends of Christ they understand not his call or proper
Dialect; they hear not his voice more than the voice of a stranger. Joh. 8.43.
So Joh. 8.43. wherefore know ye not my speech: (...), my Dialect tone, or
peculiar note, and voice, whereby I call my friends. Christ seems to marvel at
their stupid sottish ignorance; But then he resolves al into this, even because
ye cannot hear my word. They had no spiritual judgment of discretion, because
they wanted a Divine faculty of hearing his Word; and thence no wonder that
they elect him not as their Prophet and Shepherd. Yea, they are so far from
electing Christ as their Prophet, that they choose darkness before light; yea,
hate his prophetic light; because it discovers their sins. John 3.19, 20.
So John 3.19. This (...) the condemnation, that Light is come (...) the World,
and men love darkness rather than light: for their works are (...) 20. For every
one that does evil hates (...) light, and comes not to the light, lest (...)
deeds be reproved. No wonder that su^^ elect not Christ as their Prophet.

SECT. 5. The Election of Christ's person a fundamental part of our friendship
with him.
4. 4. The friends of Christ elect his person; and how?
THE real friends of Christ elect his Person as well as his Benefits. This is an
essential, and fundamental condition of al Amity both human, and Divine, to
elect the Person of our friend. He that chooses a friend only to receive good
things from him, without regard or love to his Person, is not a friend to him
whom he has chosen, but to himself only. And this has a more peculiar
consideration in conjugal friendship; which, if it terminate or fix not on the
Person of him whom it espouseth, it is but an adulterous and whorish love. Now
the Amity 'twixt a Believer and Christ, is (as we have at large demonstrated
in the foregoing Chap.) conjugal, and therefore the election of Christ's person
is the most essential ingredient thereof. Thus it was with the Spouse, Cant.
1.2. Cant. 1.2.
The first thing she breathes forth, is this: Let him Kiss me with the Kisses
of his mouth, etc. The Kiss, in those ancient and simple times, implied
nothing lascivious, impure, or indecent: but it was used as a symbol of
intimate friendship and union of spirits. For by the Kiss there is, as it
were, a mutual Transfusion, and Transpiration or breathing forth of souls, each
into other, as Plato observes. Whence friends were wont in ancient times, out
of a superstitious kind of piety, to receive, with their mouth, the last
breath, or souls of their dying friends; that so they who were dead in
themselves, might (as they fancied) live in them. So that by the Kiss here,
which the spouse breaths after, we must understand the spiritual transfusion
and inhabitation of Christ in her soul, and the firm adhesion of her soul to
Christ, as her husband. Thence it follows, for thy love is better than Wine. O!
It is the beloved himself, that is al in all in the Spouse's Books. And
therefore it is observable, that what she mentions, v. 2. of the savor of his
Ointments, and afterward, of his Apples, Wine, Myrrh, Spiknard, Perfumes,
etc. these are al to be understood of Christ himself. Duties, Graces, Comforts,
yea Heaven it self are al nothing without Christ, in the estime of his Spouse.
Cant. 2 16.
So the Spouse, Cant. 2.16. I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine, i. e. as
he has chosen me for himself, so I have chosen him for my self. He abides in me
by his spirit, and I abide in him by faith and love: he is wholly for me, and I
am wholly for him: He makes a free invitation and render of himself to me, and
therefore I make a cheerful acceptance of him, and resignation of my self unto
him: he minds, regards, and affects nothing so much as my self, mine heart, and
person; and therefore I must count what is not himself as nothing. It Is true,
to enjoy the Bracelets and love tokens of my Beloved is sweet, ay but to enjoy
himself is much sweeter: It is a very pleasing thing to see and embrace the
Divine favors of my Lord: but oh! how pleasing is it, to see and embrace the
Lord of those favors? In what precedes, we have the mention of many Divine
Benedictions, which the Spouse did participate of, in and from her beloved: the
text cited, is a reflection on her beloved himself, as the fountain and original
Idea of al her benedictions. Some conceive this Divine Aphorism, which is often
repeted, to be the burden of this sacred nuptial song: because it is most
accommodated to express that mutual conjugal Affection which is 'twixt Christ
and his Spouse. So among the Romans, they had their solemn formulae, whereby
those who entered into conjugal relation, expressed their mutual resignation of
themselves, and all that was theirs, each to other; as that: Where thou Caius
art, there am I Caia: Pagans accounted it unworthy of conjugal relation to
espouse any thing so much as the person of their beloved. What may the friend
of Christ regard, desire, or seek more than Christ himself? Does not he suffice
for Christ? and shall not Christ alone suffice for him? Does not Christ take
complacence in his friends alone as his Spouse? and shall not they take
complacence in him alone as their Husband? Conjugal Relation, albeit it may
find its Relates different and dislike, yet it makes them one and alike.
Therefore, as Christ condescends so low, as to espouse the person of his
Spouse: so her heart must ascend so high as to espouse his person for himself.
Self the first motive that draws sinners to Christ.
It Is true, the first motive that draws the friends of Christ, unto a closing
with him, is to gain life from him: it is a sense of need that drives them first
to Christ: ay but, when they consider and understand, that there is no life to
be gained by him, but by espousing of him for their husband; yea, upon a
serious, and deep contemplation of Christ, being convinced that their life and
happiness consists in the enjoyment of him, this engages them speedily and
cheerfully to elect and choose his person, as the fittest object for conjugal
Amity. As in civil conjugal contracts, and friendship, often times that which
first moves the attention, and allures the person to hearken to a motion or
offer of Marriage, is some externe good; perhaps the man offers a great dowry,
or the woman has a good Portion: these or such like considerations frequently
open the door to conjugal Amity: but after frequent visits and familiar
conversation together, the persons begin to be more taken with the personal
worth, if there be any, each of other: and peradventure at last affections grow
so pure and dis-interessed, as that, if there were no dowry, no portion to be
had, yet they would not break: Just such is the conjugal Amity 'twixt
Believers and Christ: That which first awakens the soul, and makes it attentive
to the offers of Christ, it is sense of need: the conscience is stung with
Divine wrath, and finds no Physician that can cure its wound but Christ: the
sinner is under an Arrest of Divine Justice, and having not a farthing to pay
his debts, is dragged to prison, by the spirit of Bondage and the Law: now,
while in prison, there is a motion made by the King's Son, Christ, that if the
soul will espouse him for her husband, he will pay al her debts: this is good
news indeed: what! will the son of God enter into conjugal contract and
friendship with such a sinful beggarly wretch as I am? oh! who would refuse
such a good motion? Content! the bargain is made, etc. Thus the sinner is first
driven into straits, Yea to self-despair: for such proud beggars are we al by
nature, as that no one ever attends to the wooings of Christ, til he be forced
to it by an holy self-despair, wrought by the spirit of bondage: but then being
invited and wooed by Christ, he cheerfully and readily espouseth him as a
friend and husband: and the more familiar acquaintance, and conversation he has
with Christ, the more is he satisfied in his choice of him: so that, whereas at
first, he was fired out of self by the spirit of bondage, and forced to go to
Christ, as a sick man to his Physician, or as a condemned malefactor to the
King's Son, More pute strains of friendship with Christ.
to beg his life; yet now, he sees all the reason in the World, why he should
love and embrace Christ: now he can cry shame upon himself, and all the world,
for being so unwilling to espouse Christ: now al his life and happiness lies
wrapped up in Christ; so that he fears no greater Hell than the loss of Christ,
and desires no greater Heaven than the enjoyment of Christ. Thus the friends of
Christ, though at first they espouse Christ in order to life, yet after some
communion with him, and contemplation of his ravishing glories, (as 2 Cor.
3.18.) they then find, by experience, that their life is hid in him; so that
his presence makes a young Heaven, and his absence Hell.

And this discovers to us the true reason, why the Lord, in much wisdom and
tenderness, keeps many of his elect friends, The Lords keeps many of his Elect
long under bondage and hardness of heart, to make way for a more full choice of
Christ's Person.
a long time under a spirit of Bondage, laboring and groaning under a dry,
withered, parched, hard, and dead heart; namely to drive them more thoroughly
out of themselves, to a full closing with the person of their Lord; that so they
might learn to derive al grace from him: for poor souls under a spirit of
bondage, and soul-troubles, chiefly mind the affectionate workings, and thence
the ease and quiet of their own spirits, more than the espousing of, and
depending on Christ their Lord: wherefore in much pity and compassion to the
souls of his elect, Christ often keeps them long under fruitless conflicts, and
vain attemts of their own barren, bewildred, frozen hearts, that so they might
be brought to a greater mesure, of happy self-despair, in order to a more
complete, entire election of him as their husband, and best friend, for himself.

Whence also we learn, what is the mortal wound, and plague of so many false
friends of Christ, The plague of false friends is, that they close not with the
person of Christ.
who may and often do go very far, in the election of Christ as their Priest,
Prophet, and King; yea, and receive many amicable, love tokens from him; yea,
now and then a friendly visit, and smile of his countenance; yea, some goodly
ornaments of commun gifts, and graces; yea, some commun Assistances,
influences, enlargements, and quickenings of heart in duties; and yet all this
while never come to any real, conjugal Amity, with him. What should be the
cause of such a prodigious, monstrous miscarriage? why, here lies the core and
malignant root of this inveterate plague sore; such seeming friends of Christ,
being stung and galled with divine wrath, may close with Christ, in a great
mesure, as their Priest, that so, by his wounds and righteousness, their stripes
may be healed, that so his blood may be applied as a balsame to their wounds;
that so his merits may be imputed to them in order to the payment of their
debts: yea, they may come unto him as their Prophet, and Shepherd to guide them
in this their labyrinth, and wildernes-condition: yea, farther, they may come
unto him as their King; and that not only to rule their persons, but also very
far to destroy their lusts; at least to keep them in good order, that so they
may not be, as thorns in their sides, to prick and gal their consciences: thus
far, I say, may a false friend of Christ proceed, in the election of him, and
yet for want of a conjugal closing with the person of Christ, continue a real
enemy to him. By all this we see, of what moment and weight it is, that the
friends of Christ elect his person. But more of this in what follows.

SECT. 6. The friends of Christ are to Elect his Spirit also for their friend.
5. 5. Election of Christ's Spirit.
SUch as will contract friendship with Christ must also elect his spirit for
their friend. Christ's Spirit is, not only the same in Essence with himself,
but also his Viear-general, Vicegerent, and Deputy amongst his friends, in
this lower Region of the Church: they therefore that will espouse Christ for
their friend, must in like manner espouse his Spirit, as his Substitute here on
earth, to govern, influence, and conduct them, til they arrive to the immediate
and perfect vision and fruition of the Blessed Deity. The friends of Christ
are as yet in their Nonage, and therefore he has left them his spirit as their
Tutor, and Advocate. So Joh. 14.16, 17. Joh. 14.16, 17.
I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter; (...); (...)
Vox est Attica, quae significantur illi quos in periculo accersimus, ut nobis
adsint consilio, qui iidem Advocati dicuntur, etiamsi non litigent in soro,
nostro nomine. Camero fol. 221.
which signifies such a comforter, or Advocate, as is ready, in all our straits
and difficulties, to advise, counsel, assist, and encourage us. The Tutor,
according to the civil Law, is to be a Defensor, or Gardien of his Pupil; and
none were admitted to have Tutors, but such as were free Pupils. Such are the
friends of Christ, they are freeborn pupils left by Christ, under the Tuition,
Inspection, and Protection of his spirit; whom they cheerfully elect, and
submit unto us as Christ's Delegate and Commissioner, to order, direct,
protect, and influence their souls. Are the friends of Christ oppressed and
borne down by tyrannick boisterous lusts? then, where should they go, but to
the Spirit of Christ, to quel and subdue those proud lusts? so Esa. 4.4. by the
spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning, the blood of Jerusalem is
purged away. Are they weak and infirm? then must they go to this spirit to
corroborate and confirm their spirits. Do they labor under great Deadnesses,
spiritual Stupidities, and hardnesses of heart? who then can soften, quicken,
and mollisie their hearts, if not this quickening Head, this Fire or flame of
God, with which Christ's friends are baptized? Matthew. 3.11. He shall haptize you
with the holy Ghost and with fire. Again, are their souls straightened, bound up,
and, as it were, fettered by many tentations, and difficulties? who then can
enlarge their souls and set them at liberty, but this their friend, who, where
ever he comes, brings liberty, as 2 Cor. 3.17. is it not this free spirit,
that widens, and enlarges the heart, to pour out it self before God in prayer?
Romans 8.15, 27. Farther, are the friends of Christ wounded by Tentation or lust?
who then can heal their wounded hearts, if not the Spirit of Christ? is not he
the healing virtue of the Sun of Righteousness, Mal. 4.2? Do they find spiritual
languissements, sensible consumtions, abatements, and decaies in their
Affections to, and communion with Christ? Whence then may they expect
nourishment, growth, and thriving herein, if not from this living Head, Col.
2.19? Are their hearts withered, barren, parched, like a desert place? and who
can make them revive and spread forth their branches; and make their beauty as
that of the Olive tree or Lilly, if not this fructifying spirit? is not he as
dew to Israel, etc. Hos. 14.5, 6, 7. Esa. 26.19? Lastly, are the friends of
Christ in a Wildernes-condition, under many Desertions, troubles, fears,
hurries, disquietments of spirit, about their spiritual state? who then can
speak comfort, if not this Divine Comforter? where may they expect a door of
hope, if not in this valley of Achor, Hos. 2.14, 15. Who can advise, direct,
conduct, and encourage them in their bewildred condition, if not this their
Tutor, Advocate, and friend? These and such like considerations do deeply
oblige, and strongly engage those who contract friendship with Christ, to elect
and espouse his spirit as their Advocate, Guide, Protector, and Tutor, while
absent from Christ.

SECT. 7. The friends of Christ must elect his Yoke, Members, and Cross.
6. THE friends of Christ must elect, 6. Election of Christ's ways and
ordinances.
not only his person, and Spirit, but also his Yoke, i. e. ordinances, ways of
worship, and service. So Psalm. 84.10. For a day in thy Court is better than a
thousand: Psalm. 84.10.
(...) LXX. (...). elegi.
I had rather be a door keeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the
Tents of Wickedness. I had rather: Heb. I have elected or chosen rather: and so
the LXX. render it: as if he had said, This is my great option or choice; I
have what I would have, might I but enjoy this. Why? what is it that he so
electively desires! It Is to be but a Doorkeeper in the house of his God; the
meanest office in the Church, is more eligible and desirable in his eye, than
the highest preferments at Court. A learned Gatak^r, Cinnus, cap. 11. p. 297.
Divine interprets it thus: I had rather have mine ear bored at the Door of
thine house: and so he understands it, as an allusion to that Ceremonial
Institute, or Rite, of boring servants in the ear, at the post of the door,
when they were willing to become perpetual servants. And the Targum seems to
incline to this sense in rendering it by a (...) adharere.
word that signifies to adhere. As if he had said: I choose rather to be a
bond-slave, and perpetual servant in thine house then to sit upon the Throne in
the World. Such was his option and election of Gods service. They who pretend
to elect Christ for their friend, and yet reject his ordinances, worship,
service, and ways, are guilty of a flat contradiction and solecisme in
Christianity. This was Israel's crime, Hos. 4.16.
Hos. 4.16. for Israel slideth back as a backsliding Heifer. i. e. as an
Heifer Lori impatiens.
impatient of the Yoke: Israel could be content with the privileges, but not
with the duties of friendship with God: the crown was beautiful and eligible,
but the Yoke burdensome. Christ will have al his friends espouse his yoke as well
as his crown: Mat. 11.29. Take my yoke, etc. Hence we find a sad complaint of
Christ against Ephraim, for her false pretensions of friendship toward him,
Hos. 10.11.
Hos. 10.11. And Ephraim is an Heifer that is taught, and loves to tread out
the Corn; but I passed over upon her fair neck. Here is a tacit comparation
between plowing and treading out the corn: the latter, Ephraim could
cheerfully submit unto; but not the former: and the reasons are, because (1.)
Plowing work carries more restraint in it; the Bullock was to submit its neck
unto the yoke; whereas in treading out of the Corn it was loose and free. (2.)
In treading out the Corn there was not so much toil and labor as in Plowing.
(3.) In treading out of the Corn there was not only liberty and ease, but
also profit and advantage: for, according to the Law, it is said, 1 Cor. 9.9.
thou shall not muzle the mouth of the Ox that treads out the Corn: So that
here is advantage as well as labor: whereas in Plowing work there was not only
restraint, and toil, but also no profit. No wonder therefore that Ephraim
prefers treading out the Corn before plowing. Is not this the case of a world
of false friends, who elect such service for Christ, as carries liberty, ease,
and profit in it; but cannot submit to the yoke?

7. Election of Christ's members for our friends.
The friends of Christ are to espouse his members and friends, as well as
himself. Christ's members are part of himself; they are mystically Christ; and
therefore such as reject them, do not, cannot truly elect Christ, as their
friend. But of this more in the perfective Laws of friendship.

8. Lastly, They who will elect Christ, Election of Christ's Cross.
as their friend, must in like manner elect and espouse his Cross. They can be
no friends to Christ, who are enemies to his Cross, Phil. 3.18. To renounce
our cross and sufferings for Christ, is to renounce our interest in Christ,
his cross and sufferings for us. We are never more like Christ then on the
Cross, and therefore never better friends to him then there. None that are
pleased with Christ, will be displeased with his Cross: by renouncing Christ's
Cross, we renounce friendship with him, Heb. 10.25. Of this also in its proper
place, when we come to treat of that passive obedience, which is due to Christ.
Thus we have shown how whole Christ is to be elected: his scepter, as well as
his crown; his person, as well as his Righteousness; not only his privileges, but
also his duties; his yoke as well as his benefits; his cross as well as his
rewards.

CHAP. V. That grand Case, how far the friends of Christ may regard themselves;
stated, both in the Negative and Affirmative.
SECT. 1. Christ must be elected for himself.
TO make up a complete constitution of Christ, Christ must be chosen for
himself.
as the object of the Saints Amity, it is requisite, not only that whole
Christ be elected, but also that he be elected for himself. This indeed seems
the most essential and fundamental part, or the formal Idea, and constitutive
reason of all true friendship; that our friend be chosen (...). Arist. Rhet. l.
2. c. 4.
for himself. Without this qualification, al friendship, even amongst men as
men, is reputed, by the wiser Heathens, but as spurious, and bastard; that
which will soon, when occasion serves, degenerate into secret dislike; if not
open enmity. Thence the Philosopher gives this Idea, or Definition of a true
friend, (...). Arist. Rhet. page 27.
That he is such a one as seriously wishes, and studiously endeavors the good
of his friend, for his friends sake. Though this Idea of friendship, may
possibly prove too narrow for the Saints Amity with Christ, yet thus far it
holds good, that Christ must be desired for himself. For friendship with Christ
must be taken up, not upon contingent occasions, or commun grounds, but upon
immediate reasons and proper motives, arising from an apprehension of Christ's
special excellences. An Heathen could say to his friend: (...). Socrates ad
Alcibiad. Plat. Alcib.
I am only a lover of thy self; others are lovers of thy good things. How much
more should the friends of Christ, bespeak him, their best friend, in such
language? certainly that must needs be the most pure and noble Amity, which is
leaft interessed, and most purely carried out to Christ for himself. The less
mixture of self and carnal respects there is in any friendship, The more pure
respects we have to Christ for himself, the more perfect is our friendship to
him.
whether human or Divine, the more it terminates and centers on our friend for
himself, and the more the heart terminates and centers on its friend for
himself, the more it corresponds or answers unto the universal, and most
perfect Idea of human and Divine Amity. This the poor Heathens saw so much
beauty and glory in, as that they affected nothing more than to seem thus
generous, in electing and loving their friend for himself. So Attalus
Philosophus di^ere, ol^bat, jucundius esse amicum sacere quam habere, Sen. ad
Luc.
Attalus the Philosopher said, That it was more pleasant to make a friend, (i.
e. by love and kindnesses expressed to him) than to have one: ( i.e. for our
use and benefit). And the moralist gives us this general character of his wise
man, Seneca ad Luc. Epist. 9.
That albeit he is content with himself, yet be desires to have a friend, were
it only for this, that he might exercise friendship; that so a virtue of such
excellent use, might not lie useless. -- Why (adds he) do I elect a friend?
that I may have one for whom I can die. Such pure and dis-interessed strains of
Divine Amity the friends of Christ should aim at, and endeavor after toward
Christ. For by how much the more they intend, love, What it is to elect Christ
for himself.
desire, hope for and delight in Christ for himself, by so much the more pure,
noble, generous, divine and inviolable is their friendship toward him. Now the
friends of Christ may be said to elect him for himself, when he himself gives
rest and satisfaction to their souls, in the want and enjoyment of al things.
For the first principle or element of electing Christ for himself, consists in
seeing al our satisfaction and rest laid up in him, and not in our selves, or
any thing else. Where ever the heart finds complete rest, that it lives on,
loves and enjoyes for it self; and the deprivement of that is death and Hell
unto it. Again, what we elect for it self, that we make our last end, and best
good: Now the last end and choicest good is the first priaciple in morals, and
so the most universal Idea, and perfect mesure of al good; and thence the
spring of al rest and satisfaction. So that none elects Christ for himself, but
such as can content and satisfy themselves in Christ, not in themselves: and
the more pure and disinteressed our regards to Christ for himself are, the
better friends we are. In Heaven, al these poor, low, interessed, selfish
respects which draw sinners to friendship with Christ, whiles in this lower
Region of Clay-tabernacles, will there be perfectly swallowed up, and drowned in
the beatifick Vision, and fruition of Christ for himself, and for himself
alone. But yet, while the friends of Christ are in this their nonage, and
child-bood, he does indulge them in many childish, selfish humors. They are now
in a wildernes-condition, absent from the Celestial Canaan, where Christ their
friend resides, and therefore much strangers to those transcendent excellences,
and ravishing Beauties, which shine in his person: no wonder then, if they have
many oblique and squint Regards; many private, and interessed Affections mixed
with their Amity toward Christ. Yea, all the friends of Christ, at their first
contract with him, are allured and drawn to him, by what good they hope to
receive from him, rather than by what good they see in him: and many good
friends of Christ, under Desertion or tentation, are more intent on what Grace
and Comfort they may receive from Christ, than on what they may enjoy in
himself. Upon these and such like considerations, it will be necessary that we
state and determine that great case of Conscience, How far the friends of
Christ may regard themselves, their own spiritual Interest, life, and happiness,
in their election of, and Affection to Christ as their friend? This case being
duly stated, and limited, we shall the more clearly, and satisfactorily
proceed, in determining the Christians duty in electing, and affecting Christ
their friend for himself.

SECT. 2. How far Christ's friends may, in the Election of him, regard
themselves.
AS for that case, How far the friends of Christ may regard themselves in the
Election of Christ?
how far the friends of Christ may regard themselves in the election of Christ,
it may be resolved by these following propositions, some of which are exclusive
or negative, others inclusive or positive. 1. The exclusive or negative
Propositions are such as follow.

1. Prop. The friends of Christ, in their election of him, may not regard
sinful, carnal, or legal self. This is evident; because so far as they regard
either of these selfs, so far they compound Christ, and so elect only a false
Christ, an Idol of their own brain. To have a squint eye on some beloved lust,
or the world, or the law, in our election of Christ, is a black character of an
adulterous, bastard, friend, such as would fain mediate a league between Christ
and his professed enemies: (as has been at large demonstrated, Chap. 3.) It Is
true, The elect while under a Spirit of bondage aim at legal self only.
the elect of Christ, whiles under only an awakened conscience, and a spirit of
Bondage, have an eye and regard to legal self only, or mainly, in all their
Treaties with Christ: They would fain have Christ, to pay their debts and
engagements to the Law; they come to him as their Physician, to cure their
diseases and wounds of conscience; but they see not as yet need enough of, or
beauty enough in him, to espouse him as their Husband: such a mercenarie
respect have they to Christ; whom they desire, only to promote the Interest of
legal-self: and therefore the Lord keeps them, in much mercy, under a spirit
of bondage, 'til they are divorced from this legal self.

But as for those, False friends of Christ ruined by legal self.
who belong not to the election of Grace, God permits them, and that
deservedly, to split themselves on this fatal Rock. For, albeit some convinced
sinners have layen long under dreadful terrors, and deep sense of their own
sinful state, even unto an hellish despair, yet they never quit this Legal
Self; but al their Treaties, covenants, and closings with Christ, are, at best,
but to get a legal-Righteousnes of their own. This in some is more visible and
apparent, in others more refined, and mixed of Law and Grace; which was the
case of the Galatians, whereby such false friends of Christ, under a pretension
of Amity with, and dependence on Christ, really depend on, and so are friends
to none but legal self. Just like a bankrupt, or broken Merchant, who being
cast into Prison for debt, and having a good offer of Marriage from a rich
person, is willing to marie her for her riches, without the least love to her
person, etc. such is the friendship of many awakened legal friends of Christ;
who are content to espouse him, thereby to get a stock of their own legal
righteousness; whereby they may pay their debts to the Law, and so get out of
Conscience's prison, without any sincere love to Christ, or faith in him. This
I call a mercenary, legal Amity with Christ; which is not only adulterous and
whorish; but also a fatal instrument, which most effectually ruins millions of
awakened sinners.

SECT. 3. The friends of Christ may not elect him, for the advance of an
Evangelick self-Righteousnes.
2. The friends of Christ may not elect him for an evangelick Self-righteousnes.
Propos. THE friends of Christ may not elect and close with him, only to
promote an evangelick self, of their own evangelick righteousness, and
sufficiences. By evangelick self, I understand al evangelick or Gospel Gifts,
Graces, Assistances, Quicknings, Enlargements, Duties, Privileges, Peace,
Joys, and other sufficiences; so far as they tend to promote a
self-righteousnes, or self-dependence, though never so seemingly evangelick.
This is the sad and miserable case of many Evangelick, and more refined
Hypocrites; who dare not pretend to any legal righteousness, or merit of their
own; they are too knowing, and sensible of their natural pravitie, and daily
excursions to sin, to own any such legal-self: only by virtue of their seeming
union to, and Amity with Christ, they have got a good stock of Evangelick
Gifts, Assistances, Duties, Comforts, and other spiritual sufficiences; which
they secretly, and perhaps unknowingly, cleave unto, and depend upon,
notwithstanding their pretended adhering unto, and depending on Christ as their
friend: yea, which is worse, they make use of their seeming Amity with, and
dependence on Christ, only as a blind, or engine, the more efficaciously to
promote this their Evangelick self-dependence. This was the very case of those
false friends of Christ, Esa. 48.1. Esa. 48.1, 2.
Hear ye this O house of Jacob, which are called by the name of Israel [ i.e.
friends of God] which swear by the name of the God of Israel [ i. e. who bind
themselves by an oath of Allegiance unto God] but not in truth, nor in
righteousness. How does that appear? v. 2. for they call themselves of the holy
city, [ i.e. they trust in their Church-privileges] and stay themselves upon
the God of Israel: or, Niti se gloriantur.
they boast, and glory that they depend on the God of Israel. They gloried
much in their dependence on God, that so they might more insensibly depend on
themselves. This is the case of numbers of Evangelick, and close hypocrites;
who pretend much dependence on Christ, as their only friend, but yet really
intend nothing but self-dependence; who make use of al their Evangelick
Assistances, and commun Graces, received from Christ, only to compose an
Evangelick Interest, or stock of self-sufficience, in distinction from, yea
opposition to Christ. Such a self-regard, though never so seemingly evangelick
and refined, may be resolved into legal-self, and the covenant of works, as the
mother-root thereof: and albeit it may pretend much friendship to Christ, yet
it is full of nothing but self-love, and real enmity against Christ; and
therefore the greatest abomination that may be in his estime. So cursed is its
root.

SECT. 4. Christ's friends may not Elect him merely for the sweet Accidents of
his presence.
3. The Friends of Christ may not elect him merely for the sweet Accidents of
his presence.
Prop. THE friends of Christ may not elect him purely, and soly for the sweet
Accidents, love tokens and comforts of his presence. Christ is the most liberal
and free-hearted friend that ever was: when, or where ever he comes to visit
his friends, he brings his good cheer and banquet with him, as Prove. 9.1, 2, 3.
Cant. 5.1. Eat O friends, drink, yea drink abundantly, O beloved. Now the
friends of Christ, may and too often do, dote too much on these delicious
treatments of Christ: they may make an Idol of his very love-visits, and sweet
manifestations of himself: the rings, bracelets, jewels, and love tokens of
Christ, may sometimes, even by Christ's friends, be too much doted on, even to
the neglect, and disrespect of himself. This preposterous, doting love, and
friendship Christ takes very unkindly; and therefore he often cures such
imperfections in his friends, by long absences, withdrawments of
love-embracements, and bitter desertions; that so they may learn to value
himself, more than all the sweet Accidents, or comforts of his Presence. Yet
these are but some feverish fits of love-madnes, and distempers in the friends
of Christ: they do not so much dote upon, or Idolize the love tokens of Christ,
but that still they retain the Bent of their heart, as a royal Throne for Christ
himself: and therefore, though Christ withdraw al love-visits from them, yea,
though he may seem, at times, to turn against them as an enemy, to call them
dogs, or the like; yet they still follow him, as the Woman of Canaan did, and
are resolved to cleave to him, though he depart from them; to approve
themselves friends to him, although he may appear to be an enemy to them.

But now it is quite otherwise with the false friends of Christ: It Is true, as
long as they can sit at the High table, and be feasted with the delices, and
sweet wine of Divine consolations, oh! none but Christ: he is then a great
friend in their account: ay but when Christ leaves them in a barren
wildernes-condition, to live upon a dry faith, and absent Lord, then farewell
to al friendship with Christ: when he withdraws the sweet refreshments of his
presence from them, they withdraw their hearts, and friendship from him. This
is but a bastard, mercenarie Amity, arising from that bitter root of
self-love; which is content to feed on sweetmeats, and good things that flow
from Christ, but minds not those Divine suavities, and good things that are in
Christ. The friends of Christ may not be thus selfish.

SECT. 5. Christ may not be elected for a carnal Heaven, or to avoid a carnal
Hell.
4. Christ's friends may not elect him as a means to procure a carnal Heaven.
Prop. CHrist must not be elected by his friends, as a means, whereby they may
gain a mistaken false Heaven, or the true Heaven in a mistaken false way. (1.)
The friends of Christ neither do, nor may elect him, as a means, whereby they
may gain a mistaken, false Heaven. This is the great error of many carnal
friends of Christ; who having glad tidings of the infinite delices,
sweetnesses, pleasures, joys and satisfaction to be enjoyed in Heaven, they
seem excedingly ravished with such good News, especially if they have met with
disasters, crosses, and disappointments in this World: and hence they seem
cheerfully willing, and ready to embrace Christ as their friend, to conduct
them to this their desired Heaven. But all this while they little think, or
consider what Heaven is; they understand not that Heaven consists in perfect
holiness, continued communion with, and praises of God: No, they dream of a
fools Paradis, a sensual, carnal Heaven, wherein they may enjoy both their
lusts and Happiness. Such an Heaven did the carnal Jews expect by their Messiah.
John. 6.34.
So John 6.34. Lord evermore give us this bread. Christ having discoursed of
the bread of life, that came down from Heaven, they seem very forward to taste
of it: but alas! 'twas but a carnal Heaven that they desired: they knew not
what the true bread of life was. They pleased themselves in their malice and
enmity against Christ, and yet, having their consciences a little awakened at
Christ's reports of life and happiness, they pretend friendship to him, and seem
willing to share in his bread from Heaven. Aliud est appetere b^atitatem sub
notione universali, qui appetitus naturalis est, aliud est came appetere sub
notione particulari, hoc est, beatitatem definitam. Camero, fol. 356.
Man has an innate, natural appetite, after life and happiness, under its
universal notion, though he hate it as defined, and bound up under the
particular notion of holiness, and communion with God; which is the saints
Heaven and life. (2.) The friends of Christ may not elect Christ as a means to
gain the true Heaven in a mistaken, false way. There are many false ways, in
which the false friends of Christ would make use of his help, to bring them to
Heaven: I shall only name one, which is, when men would fain purchase Heaven as
the reward of their own good works. This is natural to corrupt, proud Nature,
to desire to be saved by doing, rather than by believing: thus the unbelieving
Jews, John 6.28. What shall we do, that we may work the works of God. They would
fain get Heaven by doing; have wages for their work, (...), is Aristotle's
notion of merit. The friends of Christ may not elect Christ to avoid Hell merely
as penal.
as hirelings; whereas Christ tells them, v. 29. faith is the best work.

5. Propos. The friends of Christ may not elect him as a means to avoid Hell,
considered merely as a punishment, or an offense to, and diminution of their
particular, private good. I do not say, that the friends of Christ may not
elect Christ as a means to save them from the punishments of Hell: for this is
justifiable, as we may show anon: but I say, they ought not to elect Christ to
save them from Hels punishment, merely as a purishment, without regard to the
sin, which also is found in Hell, and is indeed the worst part of it. To desire
Deliverance from Hell, only as it is offensive to our particular good, or penal,
and not as it is sinful and so offensive to God, is a servile desire.

SECT. 6. The friends of Christ may not elect him for self as their last end;
or on their own conditions, etc.
6. Prop. THE friends of Christ may not elect him to enjoy, content, The
friends of Christ may not elect him for themselves as their last end.
and satisfy themselves, in themselves, as the ultimate object of their
fruition. To make self the last end of our desires and satisfaction, is as much
Idolatry, as to make self the first principle of our Dependence. Therefore the
friend of Christ must choose him in opposition, not only to self-dependence, but
also to self-satisfaction. He must neither seek, nor find rest and satisfaction
in any thing below Christ: yea, he must find rest and satisfaction in Christ
alone, even in the want of al things. A sincere friend sees al his good laid up
in Christ, and not in himself; and therefore he makes Christ his last end, and
the matter of his satisfaction: he studies to please Christ more than himself;
yea, he pleases himself most in pleasing Christ: hence he converts every part
of his private self, into a Christ-self; self-wisdome into Christ's wisdom;
self-wil, into Christ's will; self-confidences, into confidences in Christ, etc.
And thus the friends of Christ, As they must give al contentement to him, so
must they take up al contentement in him. To choose Christ only to give
contentment to, or take contentment in our selves, is a black marque of an
adulterous friend of Christ. The friends of Christ must study, first how they
may content, and satisfy Christ, and then, how they may content, and satisfy
themselves in the fruition of Christ, their best friend. To make private self
the last end of our satisfaction; or to convert the commun graces, or good
things we receive from Christ, to the interest of a particular self, abstract
from Christ, smells too rankly of a false friend, such as endeavors to please
himself more than Christ.

7. Prop. The friends of Christ may not elect him, Christ may not be elected
upon our own conditions.
to be enjoyed by them upon their own conditions. This is also a sad symtome of
a rotten-hearted friend, to be willing to choose Christ for his friend,
provided, it may be on his own terms and conditions. Sinners by nature are so
stout-hearted, as that they will rather part with Christ, Heaven, and Life, than
with their own conditions: and therefore the main work of the spirit of
Bondage, is, to stoop and bend the will; to make the heart flexible, and willing
to take Christ upon his own terms and conditions. 'Til the heart be weaned
from its own conditions, it is not fit to make a friend of Christ. The Heathen
moralist could say, Non recipit sordidum virtus amatorem: Soluto ad^ illam sinu
veniendum est. Sen. 222.
that Virtue receives not a sordid Lover: we must come to it with an open
breast. This is most true of friendship with Christ: he is a sordid selfish
friend, who comes to Christ with an open face, but with a breast locked up:
(which is the mode of courtiers and politicians) no, they, who will enter into
friendship with Christ, must come with an open heart, as well as face; without
Reserves, Ifs and Ands, or any suchlike conditions. They must bring an heart
of white paper, and leave it with Christ, to write what conditions he please on
it. In brief; the friends of Christ must be willing to receive al conditions
from him, but to give no conditions to him. Thus David, Psalm. 131.1.
Psalm. 131.2. My soul is as a weaned child, i. e. weaned from mine own
conditions. So Abraham, Esa. 41.2. is brought to the foot of God, to be content
to go and come, to do and suffer, to be any thing or nothing, as God should
please: whence he is styled, v. 8. The friend of God.

8. Prop. The friends of Christ may not elect him, with regard to themselves
any way, Self may not be regarded in opposition to, or competition with Christ.
wherein self may stand in competition with, or opposition to the Honor of
Christ. The great design and Interest of the friends of Christ, should be to
abase themselves, and exalt Christ. So John Baptist, Joh. 3.30. and the
Publican, Luke 18.14. Hence, when ever self comes in competition with, or
stands in opposition to Christ's honor, it ought not to be regarded by the
friends of Christ.

SECT. 7. The friends of Christ may, in their election of him, have regard to
freedom from Hell.
2. How far the friends of Christ may have regard to themselves in their
election of Christ.
THese exclusive, or negative Propositions being premised, the inclusive, or
affirmative will more easily follow. In the general, the friends of Christ may,
in their election of him, regard themselves, so far as he is offered in the
Gospel, as a means applicable, and necessary for the obtainment of life and
salvation. For, without al peradventure, he that elects Christ as offered in
the Gospel, elects him as his friend: Now the Gospel offers Christ as a means
of life and salvation to al such, as will come unto, or elect him for their
Mediator. Yea, the Gospel makes this the great damning sin, that men will not
come unto Christ for life and salvation: so Joh. 5.40. surely, if this be the
great Gospel-sin, that men will not come unto Christ for life; then it
necessarily follows, that this is the great Gospel-dutie, and that wherein our
friendship with Christ does much consist, that we elect or close with him, in
order to the obtainment of life by him. But this will appear more clearly and
fully by the following particulars.

1. Prop. The friends of Christ may, The friends of Christ may eye freedom
from Hell.
in their election of him, have an eye on, and regard to their freedom from
Hell. This is evident. (1.) Because the Gospel offers Christ to sinners, as
their only Redeemer, to deliver them from Hell. (2.) Because self-preservation
is an essential branch of the Law of Nature, which the Law of Grace, or
friendship with Christ, does not destroy, but perfect. Thus much the wisest of
the Heathens could, by their candlelight, see and acknowledge: wherefore Hence
the Stoics made (...), self preservation the first part of their Moral
Philosophy, as Laert. Zeno.
some of them made self-preservation the first part of their moral philosophy:
and (...), etc. Plato.
another says, that this is virtue to preserve a man's self, and what belongs
unto him; neither is there a more noble and generous piece of virtue, than to
save a man's self and others. (3.) The very notion of Hell, duly considered,
does both allow and require, that the friends of Christ both fear, and endeavor
to avoid it. For what is Hell, but a continued state of blaspheming, sinning
against, and separation from God? Now, may not the friends of Christ elect him,
as a means to keep them from such a state of sinning against, and alienation
from himself? (4.) Neither does this argue servile and slavish, but filial
fear, to choose Christ out of fear of Hell, so long as the Hell we fear, is not
merely a tormenting, but also a sinning Hell. Is it not the highest degree of
filial fear and love, for a child to be afraid of falling into the fire;
because thereby he shall grieve, displease, and be deprived of his father?
surely, such a fear of Hell is, not only allowable, but generous, and filial in
Christ's friends.

SECT. 8. The friends of Christ may, and ought to elect him with regard to
Heaven.
2. Saints may elect Christ with a regard to Heaven.
Prop. HEnce it follows, That the friends of Christ may elect him with an eye
or regard to Heaven, the great recompense of reward. For, (1.) Thus likewise is
Christ tendered in the Gospel, almost every where. (2.) The most loyal, and
faithful of Christ's friends are commended for their faith in eying the
recompense of reward. So Moses, Heb. 11.26. for having respect to the
recompense of reward. Yea (3.) It is the Character of Christ himself, Heb.
12.2. Looking at the joy that was set before him. This is an exemple, without
al exception, that the friends of Christ may have an eye on what they expect
from him. (4.) Heaven and Happiness is proposed by Christ as the great motive to
draw his friends unto a firm Amity with, and adherence to himself: So John
14.2. Now a motive has the place of an end (though sometimes but partial and
subordinate) and it is well known, that the end is a main principle of the
Action, and therefore ought to be looked unto by the Agent. Is it not then most
reasonable, that Heaven, which is made a motive, and so an end, (though but
partial and subordinate) to allure Christ's friends to the election of him,
should be regarded by them? Has Christ promised, and does he not offer Heaven
as an encouragement to his friends, to make them elect him more cheerfully? and
shall they not eye the encouragement which Christ gives them? What is this, but
to say, the end and motives of an action ought not to be eyed by the Agent?
(5.) Is not this to destroy Heaven, and Hell, the souls immortality, the last
judgment, and al Gospel-obedience, to deny, That the friends of Christ ought
to have any regard to the recompense of reward? What was it, that gave
foundation to that damnable doctrine of the Sadduces, denying the Resurrection,
etc? was it not this, (if we may credit the Sea Camero, fol. 177.
Hebrews) that Antigonus, instructing his Scholar Saduk, That he must not serve
God merely as a servant for reward, but as if there were no reward; Saduk,
mistaking his Master's mind, concluded, there was then no reward of good works,
and thence no Resurrection, etc? (6.) Yea, to deny the friends of Christ any
regard to the recompense of reward, what does it, but strip them, not only of
their Christianity, but also of their Sunt quidam qui dicunt, abhorrere ab
ingenio pii. hominis benefacere intuitu mercedis. At illi mihi videntur hominem
homine exuere. Camero, fol. 45.
humanity or manhood? (7.) The very nature of Heaven does approve, yea engage
the friends of Christ, to have an eye thereto, in the election of him. For what
is Heaven, but a constant vision, and fruition of God in Christ, as their
supreme happiness? So that, should not the friends of Christ have a regard to
this Heaven, they should not regard the main of their Amity with Christ. It Is
true, to mind Heaven merely as a reward; Obedience which is only for reward,
without al respect or motive of love and duty, is the obedience of an
hireling; but not that which acknowledges the reward no otherwise due than of
his Father's free love, etc. See Mede, Diatr. 2. page 334.
or as a reward to be given as hire, for our labor; or as a reward that
consists in some imaginary felicity, distinct from the enjoyment of God; such
an eye on Heaven is too mercenary, and smells too much of carnal, legal, and
sordid self, as before. But to eye Heaven, as it consists in the enjoyment of
God, and Christ; and as it is a reward given us, out of the liberality of a
tenderhearted Father; and purchased by the blood of our dearest friend; and so
given also by him, as an image, or remembrance of his free love, this is not
mercenary, but a necessary part of our friendship with Christ.

SECT. 9. The friends of Christ may elect him in order to their present relief,
under Tentations and Afflictions, etc.
3. Prop. THE friends of Christ may, The friends of Christ may desire ease from
their burdens.
in their election of him, so far regard themselves, as to desire relief under,
and deliverance from their present burdens, whether of Conscience, or Heart.
This is likewise manifest, (1.) Because Christ is thus offered in the Gospel,
to weary, and heavy laden sinners, as Mat. 11.28. Come unto me al ye that
labor, and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. (2.) This is the main of
Christ's office, as Mediator, to save those who are lost, to bind up the
brokenhearted, to heal the sick, to relieve the poor and needy, etc. (3.)
Hereby the friends of Christ are, both morally and effectively, or
efficaciously rendered more amicable, and serviceable unto Christ. For by being
eased of their burdens, both of tentation, and sin, they not only lie under
greater, and more essential obligations, but also are efficaciously, and
effectually enabled to act more friendly toward Christ. Now surely this is a
noble and generous strain of self-love, to desire to have our burdens, both of
the guilt of sin, which lode the Conscience, and of the power of sin, which
lode the will, taken off, that so we may the more cheerfully trust, love, honor,
and obey Christ our friend.

4. The friends of Christ may regard themselves any way in subordination to
Christ.
Prop. The friends of Christ may elect him with regard to themselves, their own
spiritual good, any way, so far as self stands in direct subordination or
subservience to Christ, his interest and glory. It Is true, if the friend of
Christ should eye himself, as his sole, or supreme end, above and beyond the
glory of Christ; or if he should eye himself as a partial, lower end, that
stands in opposition to, or competition with Christ and his honor; this would
smell too rankly of sordid, proud, carnal self: Ay but to regard himself, and
his spiritual good, or comfort, [servato ordine finis] in subordination to the
glory of Christ, this is a pure, generous, Divine self-love, which greatly
promotes Amity with Christ. He that thus regards himself in part, and in
subservience unto Christ only, needs not dout of Christ's regards to him as his
friend.

5. An essential connection, and samenes 'twixt the Interest of Christ and his
friends.
Prop. Christ has constituted such an essential and intimate connection, between
his own, and his friends Interest; as that they never seek, or promote
themselves more; than when they most deny themselves, and elect Christ for
himself. Thus the true, spiritual self, and interest of Christ, and his
friends, are so far from being opposite each to other, as indeed they are not
distinct ends, but one and the same. So that what Satan maliciously reproched
Job with, Job 1.9.
Job. 1.9. Does Job fear God for naught? That the friends of Christ do not
elect, and serve him for naught; See Caril on this Job 1.9. page 109. and Mede,
Diatr. 2. page 333. and Cameron. Opera fol. 45.46. But particularly, Jans. Aug.
To. 3. l. 5. c. 10. fol. 225.
may, in a strict and spiritual sense, be applied to all the friends of Christ,
who do not elect Christ for naught. There are none in the World greater
self-seekers, in a spiritual and true sense, than the friends of Christ. For
the more they deny, and abase themselves for Christ, the more they are
dignified and exalted by him, Luke 9.44. and 18.14. So far is the Interest of
Christ from crossing the real interest of his friends, as nothing more promotes
it: They cannot conceive a more compendious way to advance themselves, than by
electing Christ for himself, in opposition to their carnal, private self, and
interest. What a sweet, and glorious contemplation, election, and fruition of
themselves the friends of Christ have in the contemplation, election, and
fruition of Christ for himself, will fully appear, with the Lord's Assistance,
from what follows in the next Chapter. At the present, we shall conclude with an
observation of Ita mirabili modo fit ut sit nobis utilitatis nost^ae contemtus
in diligendo gratis Deo utilissimus. Amoris enim Dei non est digna retributio
nist ipser Deus, Ex quo fit, ut propter mercedem operari, non sit oculos a Deo
ad se reflectere, and aliquid extra Deum expectare; sed Deus ipse magis adhuc
gratuito diligendus in aeternitate sit merces. Amor enim, amoris Retributio
erit, etc. Jansenius August. To. 3. l. 5. de Gratia cap. 10. fo. 225.
Jansenius, (that great patron of Grace, and the cause of Christ) who acutely
and solidly discusseth, and determines this case; whether a regard to our
reward, or Happiness, be inconsistent with our love to God for himself? Thus
Jans. August. Tom. 3. De Gratia, l. 5. c. 10. 'It is no small error (says he)
to imagine, that our own salvation, and the vision of God, and the whole
complexum, or sum, of our Felicity may not be sincerely loved, with true
charity: As if a Christian were otherwise commanded to love himself, than in
loving God for God. For in this doing, he does mostly love himself: neither
does he love himself truly, if he does otherwise love himself, than in loving
God for himself. For by a most profound oblivion and forgetting of himself, he
does most deeply love himself: For our good (says Augustine) is nothing else
but to adhere to God, etc.'

CHAP. VI. That the friend of Christ does most promote himself, by electing
Christ for himself, is demonstrated both from the Object, Act, and Effects of
this Election.
SECT. 1. That the friends of Christ do most advance themselves by electing
Christ for himself, is proved, 1. From Christ, the Object.
HAving resolved that great Case, How far the friends of Christ may, in their
election of him, regard themselves? and in part demonstrated, that they never
more truly, and spiritually regard, seek, and promote themselves, than when
they most, abjuring their carnal, legal, and private self, elect Christ for
himself; Our main work now will be, (1.) To prosecute the Demonstration begun,
by several convincing Evidences, or Discoveries, that the friends of Christ do
most really seek, and advance their spiritual best selves, by clecting of
Christ for himself: and then (2.) To explicate How, and Why the friends of
Christ must elect him for himself?

That the friends of Christ do most really seek, That the friends of Christ do
most advance themselves by electing Christ for himself is proved, 1. From the
object Christ considered.
and advance their spiritual, best selves, by electing Christ for himself, is
evident both from the Object, Act, and Effects of this Election. 1. As for the
Object of this election, who is it but God-man or God himself, clothed with
human Nature? (1.) When the friends of Christ elect him, whom do they elect,
but God himself, the most infinitely perfect, and first Being, and last End?
And is not God to be elected for himself? Or can the friends of Christ promote
themselves more, than by electing him, who is their Last end, 1. As the last
End and chief-est Good.
and chiefest Good, for himself? Is not the last end the first mesure and rule
of al means, and Actions? and is not every Subject or Faculty by so much the
more noble, and perfect, by how much the more perfect and noble its last end
is? Wherein consists the Rectitude of an Intelligent Creature, but in his
inviolable adherence unto God, as his Last end? Libertas electionis importat
accessam ad infinitum and recessam ab inferioribus. Gibieuf.
What does the true notion of Liberty import, but a Recesse from Inferior
Goods, and Access to the infinite, supreme Good? Ought not al multitude to be
reduced to, and governed by the one, simple, and choicest good? Does not the
formal reason of loving al particular goods result, not from their own goodness,
but from that of the universal, and most comprehensive good? Now, is not Christ
our last end, and choicest good? Is not al God, and whole God in him? Can then
the friends of Christ more advance themselves, than by electing of, and living
in him, who is their last end, and chiefest good? Is not this an happy loss,
when the friends of Christ lose themselves, and al other private goods, in the
enjoyment of Christ for himself? How do they resign up themselves as captives
to his love, when once they come to see, and taste, and smell, and feed on the
Divine satisfactions of his presence? In short, have not al creatures an
Appetite of Union, or desire after their last end, and that for it self? and
does not their perfection consist in the firm adhering or cleaving thereto? Is
there any other mesure for our love of the last end, and chiefest good, but to
love him without al mesure, and end, infinitely, and for himself? And what can
more commend to us the election of Christ for himself? Is he not his friend's
last end and best good? Do not al manner of Divine suavities and attractive
satisfactions flow from him? when their hearts do in any good mesure comprehend
the wonders of his Love, Grace, and Goodness, are they not then filled with most
satisfaction, yea, with the fulness of God, as Ephesians. 3.19? And do not such
satisfying sights of Christ lift up their souls, so far above al Idol-lovers,
as that these are in no capacity to reach, or inveigle their hearts, as
formerly?

(2.) What is more attractive, drawing, 2. As the first Beauty,
and alluring, than the supreme, first Beauty, which converts the eyes of al
Intelligent Beings to it self? And is not Christ, that express Image, and
Brightness of the Fathers glory, the first and supreme Beauty? Is it not
then the Interest of his friends to choose him for himself? Has not Christ the
most amiable, beautiful face that ever was? Does not the most beautiful
essence, and all the Divine perfections of the Deity shine in him? What are
visible Beauties, but mere Deformities in comparison of Christ? In the visible
World, what is there so beautiful as light? and in the Intelligible World, what
so beautiful as Truth? Now, is not Christ the first light and Truth? Oh the
infinite Beauties of Christ's Intelligibilitie! What infinite harmony, what
exact proportion, and form is there in all his excellences? Again, how natural
is Christ's Beauty? What are al created Beauties, but borrowed colors, and
paint, if compared with Christ? What an infinite quantity of beautiful, and
glorious Truths are there in Christ? What a splendour, effulgence, and amiable
amenitie of al Divine Attributes shine in him? Well might the Spouse say, Cant.
1.16. Behold thou art fair my beloved, yea pleasant; or amiable, acceptable.
Certainly, such is the soul-ravishing Beauty of Christ, as that the
contemplation thereof, by faith, transformes his friends into a like Image, 2
Cor. 3.18. Plato says, that the contemplation of the first Beauty makes us,
(...), friends of God.

(3.) 3. As the first principle of Dependence.
Again, Is not Christ the first principle of Dependence, as well as the last end
of fruition? And does not the life, Interest, and perfection of every derived,
borrowed Being, consist in the firm adhesion unto, and intimate, immediate
Dependence on its first Principle? Praemotio Divina est conversiva ad Deum, and
sepa^ative a creaturis. Gibleuf. Lib.
Is it not the interest of the rivulet and stream, to live in, and derive al
from the fountain? When does the branch flourish and prosper more, than when it
lives most in, and upon the influence of the root? Is it thus the commun
Interest of al depending Beings, to live upon their principle of Dependence?
and is it not the Interest of Christ's friends to elect, and live upon him
their Root, Head, Fountain, and first principle of Dependence? Alas! should not
Christ every moment inspire, and infuse new life and spirits of actual grace,
into the hearts of his friends, how soon would al their habitual Graces wither,
and die away? Does not al Habitual Grace, both as to quality and quantity or
mesure depend wholly on the Divine Infusions of Christ? Are not also all the
effusions, and respirations or exercices of Grace wholly dependent on, and
proportioned to Christ's gracious Infusions and Inspirations? May we not then
hence safely conclude, that the gracious life, forces, and Acts of Christ's
friends, have an absolute, and immediate dependence on Christ, their most noble
and best self? True indeed, Christ is not their very self; they are not
Christed, and Goded, as some blasphemously dream: But yet, is he not his
friend's Next self? yea, their most laudable, noble, and best self? Alas! what
are they out of Christ, but a poor, withered, barren, weak, emty, hungry, base,
ignoble, naked nothing? where lies their riches, beauty, honor, food, raiment,
liberty, delights, life, perfection, and al, but in Christ? Does not this
sufficiently evince, that it is their chief Interest to elect Christ for
himself? But of this more in the next Chapter.

SECT. 2. The very Act of electing Christ for himself proves, that it is the
highest Interest of his friends so to act.
2. 2. Demonst. From the Act of Electing Christ for himself. Which is,
THat the friend of Christ does most advance himself, namely his spiritual,
best self, by electing Christ for himself, is farther evident from the Act it
self. Every Being does then most Act for, and Promote it self, when the Acts it
puts forth are most perfective of its Nature. Now what Acts of the soul are
more perfective of human Nature, than the Election, and fruition of Christ for
himself? 1. Most Natural.
(1.) The more Natural any Acts are, the more perfective are they of that
Nature unto which they appertain: And what more Natural to human Nature,
considered in is pure naturals, than to elect Christ for himself? Does not the
Philosopher determine, that (...), Plato. Item: Optimus motus est in seipso,
and ex seipso, quia talis est rationali Naturae cognatissinus. Plato.
Self-motion is most natural to a Rational Being? And who moves more naturally
in himself, than he that elects Christ for himself? It Is true, to corrupt
Nature this is a preternatural, and forced motion: The Animal or Natural man,
as now degenerated, sees no beauty in Christ, and therefore has no natural
Disposition to elect Christ for himself. Ay but to Adam, who was clothed with
pure Nature, it was most natural to elect God for himself: and so, in
proportion, to the friends of Christ, so far as their Natures are renewed,
Actus naturalissimus animae est, inhaerere Deo. Bradward.
what can be more natural, than to elect and cleave to Christ for himself? Is
not Christ, as God-man, more intimate to his friends, than the most intimate
part of themselves? Qui a Deo ut ultimo fia^, and primo principio movetur, a
seipso, and in seipso movetur. Gib. de Libert. page 28, 29, 85, 103, 108.
And are they not then moved in, and toward themselves, when they move in, and
toward Christ for himself? Again, what more natural to the will than Acts of
love? And is not the election of, and Adhesion to Christ for himself, the most
soverain, and noble strain of Love? Yea, by how much the more invincibly, and
intimately the wil's Love is allured, and drawn to adhere to Christ for
himself, is it not by so much the more ^ure, spiritual, free, perfect, and
natural? So great is the sympathy betwixt the renewed nature in the friends of
Christ, and Christ himself. Whence it is that the Psalmist ^ries out, Psalm.
73.28. Ps. 73.28.
But it is good [or most natural and best] for me [who am a friend of God] to
draw near to God [to be as it were fettered, chained, and glued to God, as my
best friend] oh! how pleasing and natural is this?

(2.) 2. Most living and lively.
To elect Christ for himself is perfective of human Nature, and so most for the
promotion of true spiritual self, because its the most living, and lively act
of the soul. The human soul is supposed to be, as a self-moving, so an (...),
Joan. Grammat. in Arist. Anim.
ever-moving principle. Now look by how much the more perfect the self-motion,
and ever-motion of any Being is, by so much more perfect is its life. For
according to the Philosopher, (...). Arist. Eth. l. c. 4.
To act well, is to live well: By how much the more perfect the manner of our
Acting is, by so much the more perfect is the manner of our life. And is not
this election of Christ for himself the most perfect act of the soul? can the
friends of Christ live a more generous, noble, Divine life, than by continued
election, and fruition of Christ, their best friend? Thus Christ, i^ that great
Evangelick Invitation he makes to sinners, Esa. 55.3. Vita pro vitae
faelicitate and vigore accipitur. Glass.
Esa. 55.3. says, that such as elect him for himself, and feed on him, shall
live, i. e. lead a most noble, generous, delicious prosperous, satisfactorie,
yea, Divine life. For life is often in sacred Writ, as here, pu^ for the
Tranquillity, Vigor, and Felicity o^ life. Ps. 69.32.
The like Psalm. 69.32. and your hea^ shall live that seek God, i. e. you that
see^ elect, and enjoy Christ for himself; O^ what vigorous, man-like, yea
Divine lives sh^^ you live? how lively and spritefully will your souls move and
act? Unumquodque vivens ostenaitur vivere ex operatione sibi propria, ad quam
inclinatur. Aquinas.
Does not the life of every creature put forth, and discover it self most in
that Act, which is most proper and agreeable to its Nature, purely considered?
and what Act is there more agreeable to the renewed Nature of Christ's friends,
than the electing of, and adhering to him for himself? Does not this come
nearest to the life of God, which consists in the blessed vision and fruition
of himself? And may we expect a more perfect life than to live as God does?
Surely no. 3. Most rational.
(3.) To elect Christ for himself is an act most perfective of Human Nature,
because it is most rational. The life, and perfection of the Human soul
consists much in its Rationalitie. And what can be imagined more Rational for
the Friends of Christ, than to elect him for himself? Is it not all the reason
in the World, that sinners should elect their Savior for himself? Is not Christ
the most rational object, yea wisdom it self, and therefore most attractive of
our wisdom, and election? What takes a rational Being more than Reason? And
has not Christ the most convincing, the most invincibly binding Reasons, to
attact the heart to himself, for himself? The election of Christ for himself
imports not only Head-logick, but Heart-logick also: it is the elixir and
Spirits of Reason, the deepest and profoundest wisdom to contemplate, adhere
to, and love Christ for himself. Friendship with Christ carries in it an Ocean,
a Sea of sublime reason, yea the flour of Reason. The Prodigal never came to
himself, Luke 15.17. i. e. to a sound and sober mind, to acts of reason and
judgment, til he could, by the Art of Divine Logic, dispute himself into a
resolution of returning to his Fathers house, where was bread enough, to elect,
and adhere unto Christ for himself. Such is the spiritual Logic of Christ's
friends: Is it not their highest wisdom to adhere unto their first Principle,
and last End? Is it not all the reason in the world, that the friends of Christ
should elect him for himself, who gave himself a ransom for them? what mroe
reasonable, than that they should live, and die with him, who lived and died
for them? This seems such a Demonstrative, binding, constraining Argument to
Paul, as that it quite overcame, 2 Cor. 4.14, 15.
not only his Reason, but his Affection also, 2 Cor. 5.14. For the love of
Christ (...), i. e. totos nos possidet and regit, us ejus afflatu quasi
correpti agamus omnia: alludit enim ad vatum suroren. Beza.
constrains us: i. e. does wholly overcome and captivate our Reason, like the
ecstatick impulses, and raptures of the Prophets: our Judgments, as well as
Affections are ravished with the consideration hereof. How so? because we thus
judge: [or we thus syllogize, dispute, or reason in our selves] that if one
died for all, then were al dead. V. 15. And that he died for all, that they which
live, should not hence forth live unto themselves, but unto him, which died for
them, and rose again. Oh! says Paul, if Christ died for us, what reason have
we to elect and live to him? whence he concludes V. 16. wherefore henceforth
know we no man after the flesh, etc. i.e. we are now resolved to live to, and
upon Christ for himself: we see all the reason that may be for it, because he
has been so good a friend to us. Such a Divine Logic is there in Amity with
Christ.

(4.) 4. Most Voluntary.
To Elect Christ for himself is most Perfective of Human Nature, because most
voluntary, and pleasing to the renewed will, in the friends of Christ. By how
much the more voluntary any act of the will is, by so much the more agreeable
to, and perfective of its nature such an act is. Now what more spontaneous and
voluntary, than the electing of Christ for himself? Oh! what a sweet pain is
lovesicknes for Christ? how golden are those chains, how silken are those
cords, whereby the heart is fettered and bound to Christ? Yea, is it not the
most pleasing death, to the friends of Christ, to die bleeding with love and
adherence to Christ? It Is true, the friends of Christ have their wills drawn
to, and confirmed in the election of Christ, by no less than a pull of
omnipotence: But yet, oh! Repugnanti non volenti necessitas est: in volente
necessitas non est. Seneca.
how sweetly and cheerfully does it adhere to Christ? what an happy necessity;
what a blessed constraint; what a sweet and pleasing violence is that, which
knits, and keeps the hearts of Christ's friends close unto himself? It Is a
voluntary necessity, a love-violence; every thread of this Divine election is
twisted out of love, Hos. 11.4.
Hos. 11.4. I drew them with the cords of a man, with bands of love. And what
can be more free and pleasing than bands of love? The Philosopher tells us,
(...), Plato, Conviv.
that love knows no force, but which is voluntary, and sweet: for every one
voluntarily obeyes Love. Is not this most true, here? is not the heart most
voluntarily, though necessarily and invincibly, bound to Christ, to elect,
love, and enjoy him for himself? But of this more in what follows. Thus we have
demonstrated, that the election of Christ for himself is an Act most perfective
of Human Nature, and therefore most for the promotion of true self.

SECT. 3. Demonstr. 3. From the blessed Effects that follow upon the Election
of Christ for himself, 1. The Divine Nature. 2. Liberty.
3. 3. Demonst. From the effect^ of electing Christ for himself: Which are,
THat the friend of Christ does most promote himself, by the election of Christ
for himself, may be farther Demonstrated from the Effects of this Election: for
the tree is known by its fruits; the cause by its effects. Certainly, the
friends of Christ, by the election of him for himself, attain unto many
glorious Effects and Fruits, which greatly conduce to the advance of their
true, ^. Participation of the Divine Nature.
spiritual, and best self. 1. Hereby they are made partakers of the Divine
Nature, 2 Pet. 1.4. The Divine Nature, as it is in God, wherein does it
consist, but in the immutable Adhesion to himself, his own essential Goodness,
and infinite perfection? Now the friends of Christ, so far as they elect, and
adhere to Christ for himself, so far are they partakers of this Divine Nature.
The Christian Philosopher tells us, (...). Joan. Grammat in Aristot. de Anima.
That this is the great endeavor of Nature, to beget a natural effect like to
it self. This holds true here: the Divine Nature in Christ produces a Divine
nature, in some degree like, in his friends: so that as he loves, and enjoyes
himself, for himself; so they love and enjoy him for himself also: only with
this difference, that it is natural, and essential to Christ to adhere to, and
enjoy himself as God; which his friends have only by participation, and of
Grace: yet so as that they partake of some shadow, and dark ressemblance of
that self-sufficience, that is in Christ, as God. For look as God says, Exodus
3.14. I am that I am, Exodus 3.14. (...) 1 Cor. 15.10. (...).
i. e. I am the first, infinite, self-sufficient Being; so Paul, in his
proportion, by virtue of his electing of, and adhering to Christ for himself,
says, 1 Cor. 15.10. by the Grace of God I am what I am. Though Paul knew full
well his infinite Distance from God as a creature, yet by Quod Deo competit per
Naturam nobis co ^pet t^ per Gratiam, Gig. de Libert. p. 493.
Grace, and by virtue of his adherence to Christ as his friend, he could
ascribe, and assume to himself some borrowed shadow of that Divine
Al-sufficience. And when friendship with Christ is consummate, and perfect, as
it is in Heaven, where the friends of Christ perfectly adhere to him for
himself, then there is a more perfect degree of this Divine Nature, and
self-sufficience: Then the friends of Christ are, if we may speak it with
reverence, as so many little made-Gods: Perfect liber est (...), quasi
mortalis Deus, nihil habet quod nonvult, and nibil vult quod non habet: vult
omnia quae debet, and omnia possit quae vult. Mori Disp. 2. de Great. these. 6.
they have nothing but what they would have, and they would have nothing but
what they have. Such a derived image, or shadow of the Divine Nature, and
Al-sufficience have the friends of Christ, so far as they elect and adhere to
him for himself.

2. 2. Liberty.
Another blessed effect which the friends of Christ ohtain, by their electing
of Christ for himself, is a Divine Amplitude, or Liberty. Al human Liberty,
whether Natural, Civil, Moral, or Divine, consists in an Amplitude, or
Enlargement either of State, 1 Natural.
or Acts. (1.) As for Natural Liberty, it consists in the natural Amplitude,
Homo ad immensam quandam Amplitudinem natus est. Gibieuf. de Libert. page 361.
Universality, and infinite capacity of the soul, whereby it is exemted from
al coactive Necessity, and invested with a rational spontaneitie, which
naturally, and essentially attends al its human Acts, and Motions. Now what
does more conduce to the Improvement of this Ille est liber in agendo qui a
nullo creato dependet, qui nullis limitibus coercetur, nec ex part princi ii,
nec ex part finis; qui eminentiam quandam and Infinitatem adeptus est,
secundum quam ab Infinito, ad Infinitum, super Infinito movetur, etc. Gibieuf
de Libert. p. 270.
natural Amplitude, and enlargement of soul, than a firm Election of, and
Adhesion unto Christ for himself? What is it that most confines, and narrows
the whole soul, but adherence to, and dependence on sensihle inferior good? Is
not every faculty of the soul by so much the more universal, ample, and wide,
by how much the more immaterial, and spiritual it is? And, what exemts, and
frees the soul from adherence to sensible good, and carnalitie, more than
election of, and firm adherence to Christ for himself? Who has his will more
Universal, and Indedendent as to Inferior goods, than the friend of Christ, who
elects him for himself? Is not all this exemplified to the life, in Solomon;
who, when he first elected God for his friend, had a huge large heart bestowed
on him, as well for natural, as Divine matters? so 1 King. 4.29. 1 Kings 4 29.
(...) amplitudinem cordis. Jun. Tremel.
And God gave Solomon wisdom, and Understanding, exceeding much, and largenes
of heart, etc. e Hebr. Amplitude or Enlargement of Heart. Oh, what an ample,
wide, universal, and comprehensive wisdom, and will had Solomon, upon his first
Election of, and Adherence to God as his friend? Brutum Animal, etsi non plane
ad unum astrictum sit, sicut Plaetae, and Lapides, liberate tamen non pollet,
quiae nulla infinitate gaudet: solius Rationalis creaturae istud privilegium
est quae sola Dei capax est, and ista capacitate transire potest in Divinam
Amplitudinem. Gibieuf de Libert. p. 262.
But, after his heart turned from God, to sensible good, what a narrow,
servile, fettered heart had he? Paul, who was a great friend of Christ, one
that elected him for himself, what a great, vast, comprehensive, universal soul
had he? So, 2 Cor. 6.11. Our heart is enlarged, (...): It is hugely amplified,
extended, or widened: Whereas v. 12. he says, the Corinthians, by reason of
their sin, were straightened, or narrowed in their spirits: wherefore he exhorts
them, v. 13. (...), be ye also amplified, or enlarged: and then he shows them
how they might attain to this amplitude, or enlargement of soul, namely by
returning to Christ, and cleaving to him, as v. 14, 15, 16.

(2.) 2. Civil Liberty.
As for civil Liberty, it consists in a man's being, sui juris, his own
Master, or Lord; and thence it is defined, a Faculty of doing, or power of
living, as men list, or please: whence Populi illi libe^i dicuntur, qui sunt,
(...) Derodone.
those people are accounted free, which are (...), such as give laws to
themselves. And surely none are so free, in this regard, as such who elect, and
adhere to Christ for himself. Yea, such as are servants of men, by the election
of Christ for himself, they become the Lord's freemen. So 1 Cor. 7.22. 1 Cor.
7.22.
For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord's freeman: i.
e. A servant, by election of, and subjection to Christ, becomes ingenuous,
noble, and free, both as to State, and Acts. It Is true, he is the servant of
men; ay but, is he not also the son of God, Joh. 1.12? his outward man is to
serve, and observe the wills and humors of men; but oh! how free, how generous
is he in the inward man? what generous and noble principles has he? what great
and sublime designs and aims for God? How much is he above the frowns, and
flatteries of this lower world, even then, when, with his body, he is most
officious and serviceable to men? And then as for Acts, how free is he in his
spiritual regards, and acts toward Christ, even when he is most deeply engaged
in bodily services for men? How cheerful, and active is he in the dispatch of
his master's business, that so he may gain a little time, to pour out his soul
into the bosom of Christ? Is it not admirable to see, with what diligence some
poor servants will dispatch their affairs, that so they may have some time for
converse with Christ? Whereas, peradventure, when they come to be their own
masters, they have not so much liberty of spirit and acts for Christ, as when
they were in a servile condition. Thus the servant, that is called in the Lord,
is the Lord's freeman. The Heathen Moralist can teach us, Sencca, Epist.
that virtue makes men, sui juris, their own Lords; because nothing can be
above him, who is above fortune. Again (adds he) That man can do what he list,
who conceives he must do nothing, but what he ought. Such a free Nobleman, is
the friend of Christ, who elects him for himself: Ex subjectione ad Deum
emergit Dominium in creaturas. Gibieuf, de Liberate p. 218, 260, 264.
he, by subjecting himself to Christ, his Lord, becomes Lord and master of al
inferior things, yea, of himself also. Plato tells us, that the temperate
virtuous man is, (...), above himself; because by his temperance, he has
Dominion over himself. Again he says, Qui optimus est, faelicissimus and
August ssimus est, quia seipsum regit, etc. Plato Repub. 9.
that he, who is most virtuous, is most happy, and most Royal or Noble; because
he rules himself, which is the most Royal Dominion. And who may lay claim to
such a noble, Regal self-Dominion, if not they, who adhere to Christ for
himself? Hos. 11.12.
so Hos. 11.12. But Judah yet rulety with God, and is faithful with the Saints.
Judah, so long as she kept faithful, in adhering to Christ, she ruled with God,
and had a regal Dominion over al her lusts, and al inferior things. Aristotle
(...). Arist. Eth. l. 4. c. 8.
, treating of a magnanimous man, says, that he cannot live to any but his
friend; because that is servile. How true is this of the friends of Christ, who
elect him for himself? such are so magnanimous and generous, as that they
cannot live to any but Christ their friend. Dominiem Lioertatis oritur ex
adhaesio^^ ad Deum: est vis quaedam in fine ultimo fundadamentum habons: i. e.
uti and frui omnibus, servato ordi^e finis. Gibieuf, de Libert. page 218, 264,
263.
Thus by subjection to Christ, they become Lords of themselves, and al inferior
goods: they live as they lift and please; because nothing pleases them, but
what pleases Christ their best friend: they have what they would have, so long
as they elect, and love Christ for himself. It Is true, the friend of Christ
abandons not the world as to necessary uses; but yet he is so far above it, as
that he uses it only as a servant, not as a friend: the world is under his
feet, as Rev. 14.1. the Church stands with the Moon (an emblem of sublunarie
things) under her feet. The friend of Christ possesses the world, as though he
possessed it not: his lands, houses, gardens, and other sensible goods have no
more room in the center, or Bent of his heart, than if they were the lands,
houses, and gardens of other men: such is his Dominion over the creature, and
so far does he live as he lists. But is it thus with base-minded, servile
sinners, who live under the Dominion of every base lust, and sensible good? Do
Voluptuous, Avaricious, and Ambitious men live as they list; who, the more they
have of their Idol goods, the more they want, the more vexed are their Desires?
Surely none live as they list, but the friends of Christ, who enjoy himself.

(3.) 3. Moral and Divine Liberty.
As for Moral, Spiritual, and Divine Liberty, it is most evident, that it
springs from, and consists, in the electing, and enjoying of Christ for
himself. Nostra libertas inhaeret Devinae, ut exemplari; and in perpetua ejus
imitatione versatur. Gibieuf de Libert. p. 373.
For certainly the Divine Liberty of God is the most exact Idea, exemplar, or
pattern of our Liberty: Now wherein does the Liberty of God chiefly consist,
but in the Divine Amplitude of his own Being, whereby he acts al things most
wisely, and freely, for himself? And then surely, the more the friends of
Christ arrive unto this Divine Amplitude, and enlargement of heart and ways,
to elect Christ for himself, and to act al for him, the more they ressemble the
Divine Liberty. Was not this the Divine Liberty, which David was most
ambitious of? Psalm. 119.45. I will walk at liberty, Hebr. Psalm. 119.45. (...)
In amplitudine, seu latitudine, Jun. Trem.
In Amplitude, latitude or enlargement of heart and ways: and then he gives
the cause, and reason of this his Divine Amplitude: for I seek thy Precepts: i.
e. mine heart elects and adheres to thee for thy self: La liberta di spirito e
un distaccamento del cuore de tutte le cose, per seguire la volonta di Dio.
Sales.
thy will is to me a royal law: the more invincibly my heart adheres to thee,
and thy reveled will, the more free do I judge my self. Such a perfect freedom
is there in the service of Christ! Thus have we gone through all the notions of
Liberty, with evident conviction, that the election of Christ for himself
gives the best improvement to al liberty, under whatever notion it be
considered.

SECT. 4. The Divine life, and all the Issues of it most improved by the
Election of Christ for himself.
3. 3. Divine Life.
ANother blessed effect, which the friends of Christ obtain, by electing Christ
for himself, is a Divine Life, with all the issues thereof. La vie spirituelle
consiste en des fonctions de nostre Intelligence and volente, and en des
esgards perpetuels, que nos ames ont a Dieu. Mestrerat de la foy, p. 42.
Spiritual, Divine life consists in the due functions of the mind and will, with
the perpetual regard, which the soul has to God. Now whence procedes these due
functions of the Mind and Will, but from their Adherence unto Christ? what gives
the soul a pure, and perpetual regard to God, but election of Christ for
himself? Every life is by so much the more noble, and perfect, by how much the
more noble, and perfect its principles, influences, and operations are: and
surely this adds much to the excellence, and perfection of that Divine life,
which the friends of Christ, by election of him for himself, are invested with.
For is not Christ, as Godman, the first principle of al Grace, and the last
end, or best good? Are not the Divine Influences of the spirit most
efficacious, for the Conservation, Improvement, and Perfection of the Divine
life? May we imagine that there are any operations more agreeable to the Divine
life, than such as flow from a firm election of, and adherence unto Christ for
himself?

Farther, as the Divine life it self, so all the Issues, or effects thereof are
rendered most perfect, by a firm election of, and adherence unto Christ for
himself. Solomon gives us a wise Caution, Prove. 4.13. The issues of life, which
are conserved, and improved, by election of Christ for himself are 5.
Prove. 4.24. Keep thine heart with all diligence, for out of it are the issues
of life. How can the friends of Christ keep their hearts better, than by an
inviolable election of, and adherence unto Christ? And is not this the best
expedient to conserve and promote the Issues of life, which flow from thence?
What are the Issues of Life, but, 1. Health, 2. Strength, 3. Growth, 4. Sense,
5. Motion? Are not al these maintained, and promoted by continued election of
Christ for himself?

(1.) 1. Health.
As for Health, the Philosopher tells us, (...) Cujusque est ei prop ium pabulum
and motum tributre: proprius motus Anio^i est eontemplatio Dei. Plato, Timaeo.
That the healing of any thing consists, in giving it its proper diet, and
motion: and then he adds, That the proper motion of the mind consists in the
contemplation of God. Does not this greatly evince and prove, that the health
of the soul consists in an intimate union, and adherence to Christ? For what
more proper diet can the renewed soul have, than Christ himself? and is there
any motion more decent, and becoming the friends of Christ, than a close, and
uninterrupted communion with Christ himself? And the same Philosopher informs
us, (...), etc. Plato, Repub. 4. fol. 444.
That the right method of restoring health, is to restore all the humors and
parts of the body to their natural order: for what is sickness but some
disorder etc. And then he more particularly affirms, That the health of the
soul consists in virtue? Does not this infallibly demonstrate, that the Health
of the soul is maintained, and improved by adherence to Christ for himself? For
what order, what virtue can there be in the soul, without this adherence? So
Mal. 4.2. With healing under his wings, and Rev. 22.2.

(2.) 2. Strength.
Another issue of life is Strength, and stabilitie of parts, which is a
consequent of health, and consists mostly in the Vigor, and Activitie of the
Spirits. Hence we find both these joined together as the proper effect of the
soul's adherence to God in Christ, Prove. 3.7. Fear the Lord, Prove. 3.7, 8.
and depart from evil, i. e. Cleave to God in Christ for himself, (which
according to the Old Testament phraseologie is expressed by fear) and bid adieu
to sin. What then? v. 8. It shall be health (or medicine) to thy Navel: As if he
had said; look as the Navel administers nourishment, and medicine to Infants
lodged in their Mothers womb, for the restoration and confirmation of al
parts: so this filial fear or obsequious adhesion of thy soul to God in Christ,
shall feed, nourish, confirm, and restore al parts of thy spirit. Whence it
follows: and marrow to thy bones: or irrigation, or watering to thy bones, i.
e. look as the marrow, by the moisture it affords to the bones, does very much
confirm and strengthen the same, as Job 21.24. so in like manner does the
soul's adherence to God in Christ, greatly confirm and strengthen it. The
Nerves (though most flexible) are judged the strongest part in the body,
because they are the vehicule of the Animal Spirits: And how does this notion
of bodily strength commend the soul's election of Christ, which is the
spiritual Nerve, that conveigheth spirits, and strength from Christ the Head,
unto the believing soul? Again, the strength of every thing, is said to consist
in its adherence to its first principles of Dependence: the strength of the
branch consists in its adherence to, and communion with the stock and root.
And, does not then the strength of Christ's friends, consist in continued
adherence to, and dependence on him? is not he the Vine, and are not they the
branches? and can the branch get any strengch, save by adhering to the Vine?
Was not this Christ's main errand into the world, to bind up the
brokenhearted, Esa. 61.1? The Philosopher could imforme us, (...). Plato,
Hippias, fol. 375.
That by how much the more righteous any soul is, the stronger it is. And are
there any more truly righteous and holy, than those who adhere most firmly to
Christ for himself? Does not the vigor, and strength of Grace consist in this,
that it is as a pondus or weight, to incline the whole soul to contemplate,
love, and enjoy God in Christ, for himself? Ordo (sive Amor) est pondus quo res
omnis ad finem, ut ad centrum, quietem, and stabilitatem vergit. Gib.
What is Divine Love, but an impetus, or strong impulse and bent of will,
whereby it adheres to God for himself? Is not al spiritual strength conveyed
to the soul by this means?

(3.) 3. Growth in Grace.
Another issue of life is augmentation or growth. And what more effectually
promotes the growth of the new creature, than repeted Election of, and
Adherence unto Christ for himself? The Improvement of Grace consists not merely
in the Depuration of opposite principles; nor yet in a greater Disposition of
the subject; but in the acquirement of a greater Latitude of spiritual life,
both intensive, and extensive; which arises from the soul's firm Adhesion to,
and Dependence on Christ for himself. For nothing does more transform the
heart into the glorious Image of God, than the fiducial intuition of the glory
of God in Christ, 2 Cor. 3.18. And it is most certain, that none arrive to
higher raisures of Grace in this life, than those that live most in actual
Dependence on, and communion with Christ for himself. Does not the child thrive
most, when it adheres most unto, and sucks the mother's Breasts? And is not
Christ the same to his friends, as the Mother is to the child, 1 Pet. 2.2, 3?
when is the branch more green, and flourishing, than at spring; when it abides
most in, and receives most juice, and sap from the Vine? and is there not the
same ressemblance between Christ and his friends, Joh. 15.5? Who are they that
go forth and grow up as Calves of the stal, but Christ's friends, who adhere to
him, and so lie under the warm beams of the Sun of Righteousness, who arises
on them, with healing under his wings, Mal. 4.2?

(4.) 4. Sense.
Another issue of life in the new Creature (as well as in the old) is spiritual
inward sense. Vita nihil sensibilius.
Life is of al things most sensible: and the more spiritual, and excellent the
life is, the more quick and lively are its senses: Quanto le cose sono piu
materiali, tanto e la lor' insensibilita. La Fisonomia Dela Belliere.
For by how much the more material any life is, by so much the greater is its
insensibilitie. O then what a quick sense has the friend of Christ, so far,
and so long, as, by repeted acts of election, he adheres to him, as the
fountain of his spiritual life? It Is true, peradventure he has not the grateful
sense of the sweet Accidents of Christ's presence; yet has he not the doleful
sense of Christ's absence? He has not the feeling sense of Christ's fulness in
him, yet has he not a deep sense of his own emtines out of Christ? He has not,
perhaps, the refreshing sense of his Interest in Christ; yet has he not a
lively sense of the transcendent excellence of Christ; and what a bitter thing
the loss of Christ is? According to the sweet sense we have of any Felicity
enjoyed, such will be our bitter sense of the loss thereof: Now it is most
certain that none have a more feeling bitter sense of the Absence or loss of
Christ, than they who elect and adhere to him for himself. Oh! What a quick and
deep sense have such of sin, which is the cause of Christ's departure? How do
their wounds of Conscience bleed, under the fresh, and lively sense of small
miscarriages against Christ? Such are their spiritual senses. One of the
Philosophers Protagoras dixit, (...), Diog. Laert. (...).
held, That the soul was nothing else but sense: Is not this, in a sense, true
of the renewed soul, so far as it adheres to Christ for himself? has it not
then al its spiritual senses exercised, as Heb. 5.14. Does not Paul pray for
the Philippians, That they might abound in all sense? Phil. 1.9. (...): and how
may this be attained unto, but by adhering unto Christ, that quickening Head?

(5.) 5. Motion.
The last great issue of life is Motion: and by how much the more noble and
raised the life is, by so much the more active, and perfect will the motion be:
For the manner of acting is according to the manner of existing: By how much
the more perfect the Form is, by so much the more perfect is the life: and
thence, according to the perfection of the life, we may mesure the perfection
of the operation, springing thence. And, can there be a more noble and perfect
life, than continued Election of, and Adhesion unto Christ for himself? Does
not the (...), etc. Plato Timaeo.
Philosopher assure us, That the contemplation of God is the proper motion of
the mind? And who may expect the contemplation of God if not the friends of
Christ, who elect him for himself? What is there more efficacious, to draw
forth every Grace in its exercice, than transforming sights of God in Christ,
by faith? And who are there, that enjoy more of such transforming sights, than
such as most firmly, and constantly elect and adhere unto Christ for himself?
O! what uniforme, harmonious, beautiful, yea glorious exercices of Grace do
such friends of Christ live under? Are not these the pure in heart, to whom the
blessed vision, and fruition of God is promised, Mat. 5.8? do not these behold,
in Christ, that Divine Miroir, or Glass, the Glory of the Lord, 2 Cor. 3.18?
In short; what spiritual motion can the Saints exert, without adherence to, and
dependence on Christ their Head? Joh. 15.5. without me, [or separated from me]
ye can do nothing. Thus the friends of Christ, by continued election of, and
Adhesion to him for himself, are made partakers of the Divine life, and all the
issues thereof.

SECT. 5. Divine Honor, Order, Beauty, Pleasures, and Riches, from the
election of Christ for himself.
4. 4. Effect is Divine Honor.
ANother great effect of electing Christ for himself, is Divine Dignity, Honor
and Advancement. What is Honor, even in the estime of the poor Philopher, but
(...). Arist. Eth. l. 4.
the reward of virtue, given to good men? And what greater virtue can there be,
than an intimate Adherence to Christ for himself? Again, is not the King the
fountain of Honor? and are not they estimed most Honorable, who stand in his
presence, and receive marquis of Honor, and Favor from him? Nemo altero
nobilior nisi cui rectius ingenium -- Qui imagines in Atrio expon^nt noti magis
quam nobiles sunt. Seneca.
Surely this makes much for the Honor of Christ's friends, who elect him for
himself: for such are Heavens Courtiers; they stand in the presence of Christ,
the King of Kings; yea, they are his Assessors, who set with him upon the
Throne, Luke 22.30. That ye may eat and drink at my Table in my Kingdom, and
sit on Thrones, etc. What higher marque of Honor can there be, than to have
Christ's, and his Father's name written on their forheads, as Ezech. 9.4. Rev.
14.1? Altum quiddam est virtus, excelsum, regale, invictum. In regno nati
sumus. Deo parere libertas est, Seneca.
Is it not a singular favor that such have Christ's ear, and heart to command?
Can there be a greater Dignity, than to be of Christ's Cabinet-Counsel, Psalm.
25.14? Is it not an high marque of Honor to receive friendly visits, and
manifestations of love from Christ, as Joh. 14.21. and 15.15? Farther, what
greater Nobility amongst men, than to be of the bloud-Royal? And are not those
who elect, and adhere to Christ for himself, most allied and akin to him? as
Mat. 12.49, 50. Behold my Mother! etc. The Philosopher defines (...). Plat.
Definit. 1 Chronicles. 4.9. Heb. (...)
Nobility, a virtue of Noble manners. And what more Noble manners can there
be, than to adhere to Christ for himself? What was it that made Jabez, 1 Chronicles.
4.9. more honorable [or weighty, or glorious] than his brethren? Why we are
told, v. 10. Jabez called on the God of Israel, etc. Jabez elected God, and
clave unto him for himself, etc. Such honor have they who cleave to Christ!

5. 5. Effect is, Divine Harmony and Order.
The Election of Christ for himself, is that which Produces, Conserves, and
Promotes, the most that may be, a Divine Harmony, and good order in the soul,
and its Operations. The Philosophers saw so much Beauty and excellence in
Harmony, and Order, as that One Plato.
makes it the soul of the World. Pythagoras held (...). Diog. Laert.
Another held, That Virtue, and al things else that were desirable, consisted
in Harmony: Whence Plato called Virtue, the Music of the soul; and Justice
the Symphonie, or concent of Virtues. And what puts the soul into a better
Order, Harmony, and Uniformity, than Adherence to Christ for himself? It is
said of Padre Paul, the Venetian, that that which made him most admired was,
the coupling together of Virtues, that are seemingly opposite, as Knowledge and
humility, etc. Life of Father Paul.
Oh how uniforme, and harmonious are all the motions of the friends of Christ,
so far, and so long as they adhere to him? what a sweet composure, and concent
is there of Contemplatives and Actives; of Prudence, with Meeknes; of Wisdom
with Humility; of Seriousnes, with Chearfulnes; of Affability, with
Severitie; of Solitude, with Service and Activitie? Thus Graces seemingly
opposite, do sweetly conspire, and meet together, by virtue of that Divine
Harmony, which attends the soul's adhering to Christ for himself, 2 Pet. 1.5,
6, 7, 8.

6. 6. Effect is, Divine Beauty and Glory.
The Election of, and Adhesion unto Christ for himself, infuseth a Divine
Beauty, and Glory into the soul, as also into its Acts, so far as they spring
from this root. See Les Beaux Esprits Tom. 1. Confer. 26. de la Beauty.
Plato makes Beauty to arise, from the Form, so far as it is predominant over
the matter; which is of it self without form and beauty: Others make Beauty
to arise from the mixture of colors; again, others from the prevalence of
light, together with a due proportion of parts. Al these notions of Beauty
agree well with that soul, which elects, and adheres to Christ for himself. For
when is the Spiritual, Divine Nature, which has the place of a form in the
soul, more predominant over the carnal part, than when it adheres most unto,
and depends most on Christ? when does the Face of the soul shine with most
beautiful color, and rays of Divine light, if not when it beholds the glorious
face of the Lord, 2 Cor. 3.18? Did not Moses's face shine with sparkling light
and Beauty, when he had been conversing with the Lord on the Mount Among
naturals, (...).
what more beautiful, and glorious, than the luster and brightness of the Sun?
But oh! how much more glorious is that soul, which, by adhering to Christ, and
beholding of his glory, is transformed into the same Image? (...), Plato
Phileb. 64.
The Philosopher tells us, that the very Images of things beautiful are also
beautiful, Oh! how beautiful then is that soul, which is adorned with the
beautiful glorious Image of Christ? And where is there more of the glorious
Image of Christ to be found, than in those, who adhere to him, and behold his
glory? was it not this that made David so much to long, to dwell in the house,
and to behold the beauty of the Lord, Psalm. 27.4?

7. 7. Effect is, Divine Pleasures.
The Election of Christ, is that which brings with it the most real, solid,
pure, spiritual, strong, masculine, permanent, heart-ravishing, soul-satisfying
Pleasures. Al pleasures are by so much the better, by how much the more real
and solid they are: carnal pleasures are only opinionative, feeble, and flashy;
and therefore little worth: But the pleasures that flow from communion with
Christ for himself, are most solid, substantial, and deep. Again, the more pure
any pleasures are, the better? Now the pleasures that flow from the election of
Christ for himself, are most pure and immixed: Al other pleasures are but
feculent, muddie, and drossie in comparison of these. Voluptatis generatio fit
ex infi iti and fiaiti copulatione. Plato Phileb.
The Philosopher says, That the generation of Pleasure is from the copulation
of finite and Infinite. His meaning is, that there is no true pleasure, but
what springs from the soul's union to, and communion with God. Of al human
pleasures, those are certainly best, which are most spiritual; because such are
most rational, most connatural, and most efficacious: Now such are these Divine
suavities, which flow from election of, and adherence to Christ for himself. O!
what Spiritual Delices are such friends of Christ master of, at times? Again,
those are the purest, and noblest pleasures, which admit of the least excess:
For where there is excess, there is evil and misery. Now, how does this
commend those Divine pleasures, which follow upon the souls adherence to Christ
for himself? May we excede in, or enjoy too much of those soul-satisfying
delights, which flow from Christ? no surely. Lastly, The purest, and best
pleasures are those which are formed out of the sweetest, and best Good: and by
how much the more intimate, and entire communion the soul has with its choicest
good, by so much the more refined, delicious, and permanent are its pleasures.
Oh then! what divine Suavities do the friends of Christ enjoy, so far as they
elect, and adhere to him for himself? So, Cant. 2.3. I sat down under his
shadow with great delight, Cant. 2.3.
and his fruit was sweet to my taste, Cant. 5.16. His mouth is most sweet, Hebr.
sweetnesses, in the Abstracta praedicantur de formis. Al Treasures and Riches.
Abstract and plural number; which notes a complexion of al sweetnesses.

8. Lastly, Election of Christ for himself, is that which makes the friends of
Christ masters of the best Treasures and Riches. Al things are theirs, if they
are Christ's. So, 1 Cor. 3.21. For all things are yours: i. e. all that you need,
1 Cor. 3.21, 23.
as well as all that you possess; what you want, as well as what you have: For
sometimes nothing does us more good than our wants: he that has a spirit to
bear contentedly the want of Riches, enjoyes the real benefit of them; yea,
much more than he that possesses them in the greatest confluence, without such
a spirit of contentement. Its the mind of man that makes him rich, or poor, not
the fruition, or want of things: the contented friend of Christ, though never
so poor, is yet Lord of al things, because he knows how to want them: his wants
do him as much good as his enjoy ments: what he possesses not, does him as
much, yea more good, than it does those who are the actual owners of it: what
he enjoyes not, is his in capite, and therefore by a better title, and for a
better use, than to them that enjoy these things. Again, Al things, i. e. both
life, and death, enemies as well as friends, Devils as well as good Angels. Are
yours: i. e. for your use, and good; not in possession, but in free heritage:
and how so? he tells you how, v. 23. and ye are Christ's: i. e. Because ye are
Christ's, by a firm election of him for himself, therefore al things, whereof
he is Lord, becomes yours. As the Wife, (though of never so mean condition
formerly) by virtue of her Union with her Husband, has a title, and right to
the whole of his goods; so that she can say, This house, these fields are mine:
so the friends of Christ, by electing him, may lay claim to all that is his.
Thus we see how much the friend of Christ does advance himself by electing
Christ for himself. This will more fully appear by what follows.

CHAP. VII. How, and Why Christ is to be Elected for himself, in regard of his
Mediatorie excellences, as Relative to God the Father.
SECT. 1. Christ's Mediatorie excellences from the Designation of God the
Father, Heb. 2.5, 6, 7, 8. Joh. 6.27. Heb. 3.2. Heb. 5.4, 5. Act. 2.36, 37.
Ephesians. 5.2.
HAving largely demonstrated, That the friend of Christ does most seek, and
promote himself, really considered, by electing Christ for himself, we now
proceed to demonstrate, How, and Why Christ is to be elected for himself? I
join both these considerations together, because they mutually give to, The
Distribution of Christ's excellences which render him eligible for himself:
These are, 1. Relative.
and receive from each other Light and Evidence. And the more fully to
explicate, and demonstrate, how, and why Christ is to be elected for himself,
we must consider Christ in all his Excellences, so far as he is held forth to
his friends, as eligible for himself. Now the excellences of Christ may be
considered, 1. As Mediatorie and Relative, or, 2. As Absolute. The Mediatorie
excellences of Christ may be again considered, as relative, 1. To God the
Father, or 2. To his friends, and members. Christ's Mediatorie excellences, as
relative to God the Father, may be farther referred, (1.) To the Father's
Divine Designation, and Appointment; whereby Christ was furnished with a
Faculty, and commission for his Office; or, (2.) To the Father's Divine
Adaptation, and Qualification; which gave Christ an Aptitude or fitnes for his
Office, as Mediator. We shall, with the Lord's Assistance, treat of each in
their order.

1. We shall begin with Christ's Mediatorie excellences as relative to God the
Father's Designation, or Appointment; Christ's mediatorie excellences as
relative to God the Father's Designation.
whereby he received (to speak in the Civilian's Phrase) a Faculty, or
commission for his Mediatorie Office. As in Nature, so in Grace, it seemed good
to God, to elect one commun Principle, or Person, which should be as an Head or
Fountain, through which all the streams of his Grace should flow. Haec agendi
ratio convenit cum Axiomate Philosophico, Dari in unoquoque genere, aliquod
summum, primum and excellentissium, a quo reliqua ejusdem generis descendant,
and accipiant quod est illius generis, etc. Ca^^^o, fol. 35.
This is most agreeable to the Infinite Wisdom and Bounty of God; yea, to that
Principle of Reason, which will have one chief Head, or first, and most
excellent in every kind, from which all the rest, which belong to that kind,
must descend, and receive what appertains to their kind. Thus in Nature, and
the Creation, the first Adam; thus also in the world of Grace, or the
Recreation, and reparation of corrupt Nature, Christ the second Adam, was, by
God, constituted a commun Head, and principle of life. So, Romans 5.19. For as by
one man's Disobedience, many were made sinners; so by the obedience of one, shall
many be made righteous, i. e. look as the first Adam was a commun Head to al
his posterity, and so by his sin brought death on al; so Christ, the second
Adam, is a commun Principle to al his elect seed, and by his obedience brings
life to al, Heb. 2.5, 6, 7. The World to come, What it is?
as v. 21. The like Heb. 2.5, 6, 7, 8, 9. where we are told, that the world to
come, that is, the world of Grace, was not made subject to Angels, but to
Christ, that so by the Grace of God, he should taste Death for all his seed. We
may here consider, as it were, two worlds: the one old, and sinful, subject to
Adam, as the commun root, and parent thereof. This old sinful world is full of
Rebellion against God; misery, weakness, bondage, reproach, sin, and Death; and
is now under the power, and tyranny of Satan, the God of this world, as 2 Cor.
4.4. The other world, restored by Christ, is full of Grace, Peace, Righteousness,
Holiness, Obedience, Life, and the Favor of God: This is here called, v. 5. the
world to come; and so is distinguished from the old, past world of sin, not so
much in regard of time, (For this new world began also even from Adam's fall) as
in regard of State: for the sinful world, whereof Adam was the first principle,
is called the old, past world, in respect of its sinful state; and the world of
Grace is styled the world to come, and the new world, in regard of its renewed
state; as it is a state of grace, life, and salvation; whereas Adam's world,
was a state of sin, Death, and condemnation. Thus Esa. 65.17. for behold I
create new Heavens, and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered.
Where this world to come, is called the new world, and so opposed to the former
old world of sin. So in like manner, we find mention of the old and new man in
Believers, which referrs to the different principles of Nature and Grace. Thus
we see what is here meant by the world to come; namely, the elect, believing
World; the new Kingdom of Grace. Now this world of Grace, is said to be put in
subjection, not to Angels, or any other Creature, but to Christ, Heb. 2.5.
v. 5 -- 9. For unto the Angels has he not put in subjection the world to
come, etc. i. e. God the Father has not made Angels Commission-officers, or
invested them with a Faculty and Authority to Govern this New world of grace:
Neither they, nor any other creatures are designed Mediators, Purchasers, or
Dispensors of Grace, in this new world, but the Son of God alone: So, Heb. 2.8.
v. 8. Thou put al things in subjection under his feet, etc. i. e. The Son
of God, and he alone, is invested, by God the Father, with all Authority, to
change the old, sinful, ruinated world, into a new, repaired world of Grace,
and Righteousness: neither is there the least tittle, or pin, in this world to
come, which is not subject to Christ: so it follows: For in that he put al in
subjection under him; he left nothing that is not put under him. By which it is
evident, that no part of this new world, can be subject to, or dependent on any
creature; no not Angels! the whole being, by the Designement and Appointment of
God the Father, made subject to Christ alone. This is farther manifest from
that comprehensive notion, World, v. 5. Where Christ's Kingdom of Grace,
appointed him by God the Father, is called the world to come, to note the
universal Restitution, or Recreation, and Renovation of al things, in this new
world, by Christ; it being he alone, who is empowered to change the old world
of sin, and miscrie, into a new world of Grace and Righteousness. Thus Deering
on this place: 'For seeing the world to come, notes all the Restitution which is
by Christ, the full change of all that ever was by sin, it is therefore named
world; because we should assuredly know, there is nothing excepted. If then no
part of this world be subject to any Creature, no not to Angels, in whom else
then can we trust, to have any part of this wrought for us: we are al, as our
fathers were, men by Nature of the old world, etc.' Thus we see how the whole
Kingdom of Grace, styled here the world to come, is, by the ordination of God
the Father, made subject to Christ alone, in opposition to Angels, and al other
Creatures. Hence Christ is styled, Esa. 9.6. the Father of Eternity: Which the
LXX. render, (...), The father of the world to come.

We have another great, and convictive Testimony, to prove Christ's
Designation by God the Father, Joh. 6.27. Joh. 6.27. How Christ is Sealed.
For him has God the Father sealed. Christ, as Mediator, was sealed by God the
Father many ways. (1.) He had the privy seal of God the Father's election;
whereby he was constituted Head of all the Elect Quod si in Christo sumus
electi, non ^n nobis ipsis reperiemus electionis nostrae certitudinem: ac ne in
Deo quidem Patre, si nudum illum absque filio imaginamur. Christus ergo
speculum est, in quo electionem nostram contemplari convenit, and sine fraud
licet, Calv. Institut. fol. 197.
(2.) He was sealed by the indelible character of the Father's Glory, Heb.
1.3. by the fulness of the Deity, espousing, and dwelling in the Humanity,
Col. 2.9. (3.) Christ had also the Broad Sea of an audible Testimony from
Heaven, Mat. 3.16, 17. (4.) Christ was sealed by many Miracles, which were al,
so many visible seals of God the Father. (5.) He was sealed also by his
Baptism, and solemn inauguration, or installement into office. (6.) God the
Father sealed Christ by giving him up as a sacrifice for sin, and owning of him
by sensible tokens from Heaven, on the Cross. (7.) Christ was also sealed by
being justified, and raised up from the Dead, Romans 1.4. Thus was Christ sealed
by the Father, as being designed and appointed by him, in his eternal election,
as also anointed, called to office, set forth, inaugurated, sanctified, and
every way furnished, both with Authority and power to be the Mediator, and
Savior of the Elect.

We have farther evidence of God the Father's constituting, or appointing
Christ to his Office, Heb. 3.2. Who was faithful to him that appointed him,
etc. Heb. 3.2. (...), Hebr. (...) est etiam ornare: quoniam vero munus
dignitatem affert and ornamentum, hinc fit ut vocare adsit etiam (...) Sic
infra, cap. 5. v. 5, 5. Camer. fol. 394.
(...), to him that made, constituted, dignified, adorned him with his office,
according to the import of the Hebr. (...): thus Heb. 5.4, 5. it is said, that
Christ took not this Honor to himself, but was called thereto of God, Heb. 5.4,
5.
as Aaron also was: so in like manner Christ glorified not himself, in being
made an High Priest; but he that said unto him: Thou art my Son, to day have I
begotten Thee: i. e. look as Aaron's Dignity and Glory, as High Priest,
sprang wholly from God's Divine Vocation and Constitution: had he assumed, or
taken that Honor to himself, without being constituted, and appointed thereto
by God, it had been so far from being a Dignity, and Glory to him, as that it
would have proved the greatest blot, and reproach imaginable to him, as it was
to Saul, and Vzziah, who entrenched on the Priestly office, without any Call
from God. But it is observable, that Christ's Vocation, here, is brought in by
way of Antithesis, or opposition to, and preference above that of Aaron. Aaron
was called to a Priesthood of Types, Signs, and Shadows; which endured but for
awhile; but Christ was called to the true, substantial Priesthood, which
changed not, but continued for ever, after the order of Melchisedec. Again,
Aaron's Vocation was but that of a servant; but Christ's that of a Son. So that
look, as the substance is better than the figure; the Son higher than the
Servant; and immutable better than that which is mutable; so much does Christ's
Vocation excede that of Aaron. Thus Christ's Dignity, Glory, and Honor, as
the great High Priest, and Mediator betwixt God and Man, is made to result, and
issue from God the Father's Vocation, Constitution and Appointment. We find a
parallel expression (to this Heb. 3.2.) in Act. 2.36. Act. 2.36.
Therefore let all the house of Israel know for certain, that God has made that
same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ. Peter having given an
infallible Demonstration of Christ's being the only Messiah, he concludes his
Discourse with this convictive and close application, Therefore let all the
house of Israel know for certain, that God has Made, etc. as if he had said,
why Brethen, do you know what you have done, in crucifying this Jesus? is he
not the Lord of Glory, the only High Priest, and Messiah? Has not God Made him
Lord and Christ? (...), it is the same Verb with that Heb. 3.2. i. e. God has
dignified, glorified, honored him with the Title, and Office of being the
Messiah, and only Mediator. And what follows? v. 37. Now when they heard this
they were pricked in their heart, etc. What? Have we, indeed, crucified the
Lord of Glory? have we imbrewed our hands in his blood, who was dignified, and
honored, by God the Father, with the Title and office of Mediator? Oh! we never
dreamt of this: What sinful, miserable wretches are we, who have crucified him,
whom God has made, or constituted, appointed, and glorified, as the only
Messiah? This pricked, or galled their consciences sorely. Thus every where in
the Evangels, especially in that of John, when our blessed Lord undertakes to
convince the Unbelieving Jews, of their sin, in rejecting him, the true
Messiah, he gives spirit and force to his Arguments, from this Medium, that he
assumed not his mediatorie Office and Dignity of himself; but received it from
God the Father: So Joh. 5.22, 23, 37, 43, etc. Opera Christi non fu^runt actu
meritoria citra permissionem Dei, etsi ex se esseat valo is infiniti. Sancto
Joseph. These. 74.
And indeed al Christ's Mediatorie Acts, albeit of themselves they should be of
infinite valor, or worth, would notwithstanding be no way meritorious, and
sufficient to redeem sinners, without this Divine Designation, Constitution,
and appointment of God the Father; who lies under no obligation, but what
arises from his own constitution and covenant of Grace, to accept of any
satisfaction for sin. Hence it is, that Christ's Sacrifice for sin, Ephesians. 5.2.
is styled, Ephesians. 5.2. a Sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling savor, i. e. as
it is adequate to the Divine appointment of God the Father. For, were there not
an exact commensuration or proportion, betwixt God the Father's Divine
constitution, and Christ's performance, his Sacrifice would never have proved a
sweet smelling savor to God. And, I think, we may be bold to assert, that in all
those Scriptures of the Old Testament, wherein we find mention of a
sweet smelling Sacrifice offered to God, it must be understood of Christ, wrapped
up under those terrene shadows. So Genesis 8.21. it is said, Genesis 8.21.
The Lord smelled a sweet savor, [or a savor of rest] in Noah's Sacrifice:
Whereby God's (...), complacence, and satisfaction in the Sacrifice of his Son,
typified by this of Noah, is expressed. For as men are recreated and refreshed
by sweet smelling savors; so is God, by the Sacrifice of his Son; because it is
according to his own constitution. God had been greatly offended by the
horrible fetor, or stinking ordure of sin, which had polluted the old World; ay
but now, upon Noah's offering up a Sacrifice, as a specimen of his faith in
Christ, typified hereby, the great God is wonderfully recreated and refreshed;
as men are by sweet smelling savors. And it is remarquable, that Moses says
not, that God smelled the savor of the Holocaust, or burnt offering, mentioned,
v. 20. but a savor of rest, or complacence, arising from the Sacrifice of his
Son, shadowed forth thereby. There are no Sacrifices, no good works or
performances, though never so Evangelick, and refined, that are a
sweet smelling savor unto God, farther than they are perfumed by the
Satisfaction, and Incense of Christ: neither would Christ's satisfaction have
been a sweet savor unto God, had it not been regulated by, and commensurate to
the Divine constitution. By all this it appears, How the friends of Christ must
eye his Divine constitution and Designation in their election of him.
of what absolute necessity it is, that the friends of Christ, in their
election of him for himself, have a particular eye and regard, unto God the
Father's Designation and appointment of him. Has God the Father constituted, or
made Christ a second Adam, a public Representative, or commun person? Oh then!
how cheerfully should his friends elect him as such? Is the world to come, the
Kingdom of Grace, by God the Father put in subjection to his Son, and to him
alone, in opposition to al other Mediators, whether Saints, or Angels, or our
own self-sufficiences? Shall not his friends then voluntarily and freely resign
up their souls, their persons, their Al to his trust, and Disposement? Again,
has God the Father put so many Seals on Christ, to assure his friends, that he
is the chief corner stone, chosen of God, and precious, as 1 Pet. 2.4? How
readily then ought they to set their seal of faith to Christ, to embrace and
choose him, as thus chosen of God, and build their souls upon him? Lastly, was
Christ, Heb. 3.2. Act. 2.36. Made, i. e. constituted, dignified, adorned, and
glorified, by God the Father, with that glorious Title of Honor, and Office of
Being Mediator between God and Men? Oh then! how should the friends of Christ,
by their solemn consideration, and acceptance of him, as offered and
delivered to them by God the Father, exalt and honor him as their constituted,
Crowned Lord? Was not this the very design of God the Father, in committing al
judgment and power to the Son, that al should honor the Son, even as they
honor the Father, Joh. 5.22, 23.
Joh. 5.22, 23. But has committed al judgment to the Son: That al men should
honor the Son, even as they honor the Father: i.e. Christ, by the Designement,
and Appointment of God the Father, has received an absolute Dominion and
Soveraintie over al creatures, men and Angels, etc. that al men should honor
him, with the same honor with which they honor the Father. Now Christ is thus
honored; (1.) By cheerful acceptance of him as our constituted Mediator. (2.)
By lively, and daily Admiration of those Divine excellences that dwell in him:
The more we admire the incomparable perfections of Christ, the more we honor
him. (3.) By raised spiritual Affections toward him: We honor them most whom
we love best. (4.) By Divine Adoration of him. Al Divine honor implies
Adoration: and the more we adore Christ, the more we honor him. (5.) By Divine
subjection to his will. Obedience to the will of our Superiors, is a great part
of that honor we owe unto them. (6.) By Divine Satisfaction in Christ, as our
choicest good. Heart-satisfaction in Christ as our best good, is the highest
honor we can give unto him. (7.) By Divine Imitation: We honor them greatly,
whose virtues we imitate. Thus the friends of Christ must honor him, as their
constituted Mediator. But alas! how greatly defective are, even the friends of
Christ, in their election of, and honor given to him, in regard of this Divine
constitution, Dignity, and Office, vouchsafed to Christ, by God the Father?
Certainly much of the Beauty and Glory of Christ, as Mediator, does, not only
spring from, but also consist in God the Father's Commission, or Faculty,
conferred on him. As the Dignity and Glory of an Ambassador consists more in
his Commission, and Authority vouchsafed by his Prince, than in his Pomp and
Retinue: So a great part of the Dignity and Glory of Christ, as Mediator,
consists in the Commission and Authority, which is vouchsafed him by God the
Father: and the more the friends of Christ, eye and regard this Divine
Designement, and Appointment of God the Father, the more they elect him for
himself, and the better friends they make. Yea, by such a clear, spiritual,
deep, fixed contemplation, and consideration of Christ, under this glorious
Constitution and Designation of God the Father, the friends of Christ not only
exalt and honor him most, but also most promote their own Interest, Grace,
Liberty, Dignity, peace, and Joy, as we have shown in the foregoing Chapter.

SECT. 2. Christ's Aptitude for his Office, proves him to be most eligible for
himself, Joh. 1.14, 16.
2. ANother Mediatorie excellence of Christ is his Divine Aptitude, Christ's
Aptitude and Ability.
or fitnes for his Office; which is relative to God the Father's Adaptation or
qualification. Qui dat sacultatem dat, quantum in se est, quae ad facultatem
sunt necessaria, quod in materia moral^ intelligendum est morali modo. Grotius
de Jure Belli l. 3. c. 22. par. 2. This Apti^ude is called by the Grecians,
(...), power, or force, as the former Faculty is called (...), Authority:
Hence that civil Axiom, Vis est ad cogendum, Potest as ad imperandum, Justin.
Institut.
As in Civil Commissions, he that gives a Faculty or Authority to act, gives
also, so far as he may, an Aptitude, or Ability for the execution of that
Faculty and Commission. This holds most true here: God the Father has given
Christ, not only a Faculty or Commission, but also an Aptitude or Ability for
the execution of his Commission and Office. This Aptitude or fitnes consists in
that Divine plenitude or fulness of Grace and power, which is loged in Christ,
as Mediator. Thus Joh. 1.14.
Joh. 1.14. And the word was made flesh, and dwelt among us (and we beheld his
Glory, the Glory of the only begotten of the Father) full of Grace and truth.
We have here a full account of Christ's Qualification and Aptitude as Mediator.
(1.) We have here the immediate spring of Christ's Divine fulness; and that is
the Word Incarnate, expressed in those first words, and the Word was made
flesh: The Divine Word, or second person in the Trinity, by an ineffable,
inconceivable Hypostatick union, espousing the human Nature, is the source and
spring of all that Grace that is loged therein. But (2.) God the Father is also
brought in as the original head spring, and fountain of this Divine Plenitude
of Grace loged in Christ: for John says: and we beheld his glory, the glory
of the only begotten of the Father. Though this glory of Christ may possibly
refer also to his eternal generation, as the second person in the Trinity; yet
we must not exclude, but may safely take in his glory as Mediator, resulting
from his incarnation; in which regard he is often called the Son of God, as Heb.
5.5. Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee. And that this sense must be
taken in, is evident, both from what precedes, and what follows: Illud notandum
voce (...), quae eadem sono and significatu est cum Hebr. (...), alludi ad
conspicuam Divinae Majestatis praesentiam, quae Chaldaeo Paraphrastae etiam
(...), unde (...) Grot. in loc.
for he speaks here of the Word Incarnate, and of that glory which resulted
from him as such, and was apprehended by the believing Jews, who had
conversation with him; alluding, as it seems, to the Divine Shekina, or Gods
glorions dwelling in the Temple; which was but a Type of Christ's buman Nature.
This appears from that notion [dwelt among us] for (...) seems evidently
derived from (...); and so it is an allusion to the visible presence of the
Divine Majesty in the Temple; which the Hebrews call (...) the Inhabitation:
and thence the Evangelist adds: and we beheld his glory. This also seems
exegetick of what precedes; and therefore the Chaldee Paraphrast is wont to
express the Divine Shekina by (...), which signifies Glory. So Romans 9.4. the
Ark, which was the visible symbol of God's presence, and a particular type of
Christ, is called the Glory, because God's glory shone there. Farther, that
John speaks here of Christ's mediatorie generation and glory, seems also
evident from what follows: full of grace and truth: That this must be understood
of his Mediatorie Plenitude is evident. (3.) In that it is said, Christ is Full
of Grace and Truth, we must hereby understand al those habitual graces, or
gracious habits and Dispositions, which are loged in Christ's human Nature; and
by Virtue of the Hypostatick union, may be said to be infinite in order of
Grace, though in order of Being they are finite, and of the same kind with our
Grace, as the I^ Christo suit gratia habitualis, caque ejusdem specici cum
nostra; and finita in genere entis, quamvis ^ici solet infinita in genere
gratiae. Petr. Joseph. These. p. 19.
Schools determine. Hence this plenitude or fulness, which is ascribed to
Christ, is not the fulness of a vessel, such as is the fulness of Angels, and
glorified Saints; but it is the fulness of a fountain, or inexhaustible Ocean,
which can never be drawn dry: whence it is said, Joh. 1.16.
v. 16. and of his fulness have al we received, and Grace for Grace. Christ
clothed himself with human flesh and blood, that so he might become an infinite
mass, and boundless Sea of Visible, speaking, breathing, weeping, bleeding,
living, dying Grace. All the glorified Saints and Angels are but living
monuments, and ever-living Tenants of this Free Grace: This Grace of Christ
perfumeth Heaven and Earth. All that Grace which God does, or can put forth for
the salvation of sinners, is laid up in, and exhibited by Christ: He has broad
and strong shoulders, which can bear to Heaven, the most heavy lumps of Hell.
There is more force and omnipotence in Christ's infirmity and sufferings, than
in all the strength, and efficacy of men and Angels: There is more life in
Christ's death, more riches in his poverty, more victory in his hanging on
the Cross, than in all the world besides. Yea, Christ's very sighs, tears,
sweat, stripes, thirst, reproaches, and faintings have a soverain efficacy in
them, for the procuring, and conferring Grace on his Redeemed ones. Thence, we
receive of Christ's fulness, Grace for Grace: i. e. look as the child receives
from his parent limb for limb, member for member; or as the Sons of Adam
receive al of his fulness sin for sin, lust for lust; so Christ's regenerated
sons receive of his fulness, Grace for Grace: There is not any Grace in the
heart of Christ, but his members have an Impartment, and Ressemblance thereof.
Now this infinite plenitude of Grace in Christ, which renders him so glorious,
procedes originally from the election of God the Father. For all the Treasures
of Grace are originally loged in the soverain good pleasure, or heart of God
the Father, who has elected and ordained Christ as mediator; through whom al
are to be conveyed to the elect. This ought greatly to be remarqued, or
heeded by the friends of Christ, that, albeit the Divine essence, and soverain
will of God be the Original fountain of al Grace, yet he has determined, Al
Grace passes through, and from Christ, as an infinite Ocean.
that not one drop of this Grace shall be derived unto sinners, but through
Christ as mediator. This is the great mystery of the Gospel, the great wonder
of Heaven and Earth, that the blessed God, who is the fountain of al Grace,
should so far condescend to sinners, as to assume buman Nature, and make it a
receptacle and vehicle to conveigh al Grace unto them. And oh! what an infinite
plenitude of Grace is there loged in Christ? What admirable blossoms of Grace,
and Glory does this most beautiful Rose of Sharon daily send forth? How does
every leaf of this Tree of life serve for the healing of the Nations. What
everliving Springs, Seas, Floods, and Rivers of Grace have, for almost six
thousand years, flowed from this Fountain of life and Grace? Suppose the Sun to
be multiplied into millions of millions of Suns; and those filled with infinite
mesures of light and heat: yet al these would be nothing, in comparison of
those infinite Treasures of Grace that are in Christ. Yea, suppose all the
elect, Angels and Men, to have existed from al eternity, (which is yet
impossible) and received out of Christ' fulness, Grace for Grace; yet,
notwithstanding such an eternal effluxe or issue of Grace, Christ would never
be exhausted, or weary of giving forth Grace: For, as Christ can never cease
to be Christ, so he can never cease to be an eternal, infinite, overflowing
Ocean of boundless Grace. And, as this Grace of Christ is infinite in it self;
so also in the manner of its emanation it is infinitely free, efficacious, and
soverain. Does not this Grace often surprise the most graceless persons? Did it
not transform Saul, a black-mouthed Blasphemer, and bloody Persecutor, into a
St. Paul? How many ugly lumps of Hell, has this soverain Grace of Christ
transformed into a beautiful Heaven? Yea, what is Heaven but an house filled
with standing Miracles, and living Monuments of this Grace? Should Christ strip
glorified Saints, of his Jewels and ornaments of Grace, what would remain but
poor, naked Nature? surely there is as much Grace spent in Heaven, as on earth;
yea, the more Glory, the more Grace: Saints in Heaven are as poor and naked,
without Christ as we. So infinite and essential are our obligations to Christ.

In short, God the Father having Treasures of free grace by him from al
Eternity, not for himself, but for sinners, he was not content to have them
loge, to al eternity, within his own heart and bowels; but found out this
admirable way, (so far above Nature) of rich and condescendent Love and Grace,
for the conveighing of his Grace through his Son incarnate, or God-man; who is
as an Universal, living Glass, on which all the Beams of Divine Grace
immediately shine; and from whence they are reflected unto the hearts of
sinners, for the illuminating, animating, and transforming of them, as 2 Cor.
3.18. of which more anon. Whether the Grace of Christ received any
Augmentation? See Janes against Hammond.
We shall not enter on that Schole-Dispute, Whether this Graee of Christ, after
its first Infusion into the human Nature, received any intension or
Augmentation? but content our selves with the received commun Persuasion (not
only of Protestants, but also of the Popish Schools) Haec Gratia Christi de
lege ordinar a augeri non potuit, absolute tamen potuit, St. Joseph. These. 44.
That the Grace of Christ, albeit it received gradual extension as to fresh
objects and Acts, (in which regard Christ is said to grow in Grace, etc.) yet
it received not any gradual intension, or Augmentation, as to the principles or
habits thereof; but was, at the first moment of the Hypostatick Union, perfect,
not absolutely, (for so only God is perfect) but so far as it was, according to
God's Divine ordination, requisite for the Human Nature to be invested with
Grace, in order to Christ's being a perfect mediator. Thus we have shown how
Christ, as Mediator, was, by God the Father, made the Receptacle, or Ocean of
al Grace to be conveyed to the Elect; which indeed renders him, surpassing
glorious and eligible for himself.

SECT. 3. How al Divine perfections dwell in Christ, the Mediator, as in a
Temple, Col. 2.9.
BUT yet to penetrate, How the Deity and Divine Perfections dwell in Christ as
Mediator?
or dive more deeply into this great Evangelick Mystery, and wonder of Angels
and men; we are to consider, how that, not only the Grace of God, in a Divine
plenitude, (according to moral estimation infinite) was communicated to the
human nature of Christ, but also the whole Deity, and all the Divine
Attributes, perfections, and excellences of God, by virtue of the Hypostatick
Union, dwell therein, which renders Christ as Mediator, Infinitely Glorious and
desirable for himself. See Am^s. Medul. Theol. l. 1. c. 17.
For Christ, the second Person of the Trinity, although he has but one
subsistence, yet has he a double manner of subsisting; one in the Divine Nature
from eternity; the other in the Human Nature upon his Incarnation; which
latter manner of subsisting agrees to the Son of God, by reason of the Union
which he has with the Human Nature, assumed by, and inseparably subsisting in
the Divine Person; yet without any commixtion or confusion of the Deity in
Christ, with the Humanity, or of the Humanity with the Deity. So Mat. 1.23.
Emmanuel, God with us: and Job. 1.14. Ex hac unione sequitur persenalis
communicatie proprietatum quae non est realic transfusio, sed est communio vel
concursus ad easdem operationes. -- Hinc fit quod omnes Actiones and Passiones
Christi referuntuy proprie ad ejus personam, tanquam ad terminum little
proprium, Ames. Medul. Theol. l. 2. c. 17. These. 21.22.
Hence follows a communication of proprieties; so that whatsoever belongs to
either Nature may be attributed to, and predicated of the Divine Person. Thus
he who is the eternal son of God, is said to be borne in time: he who was the
Creator of all the World, becomes a creature: he who was David's Lord, becomes a
son of David, as Luke 20.44. which puzzled all the Jewish Doctors; he who was the
immortal Lord, dies on the Cross, 1 Cor. 2.8. All this is said of the Divine
person, though not of the Divine Nature. And oh! what a wonder of wonders is
here, that the Divine and Human Nature, which were at such an infinite
distance, should be reconciled in Emmanuel, God with us? What? Does the same
person who is God, become man; yea, God and man bypostatically united? Is our
Emmanuel, as verily God as man; and as verily man as God? Oh! what a great
mystery of Godliness is this, God manifested in the flesh, 1 Timothy 3.16? How
much does this our Emmanuel deserve to be Elected for himself?

Hence it is said, Col. 2.9.
Colos. 2.9. For in him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily, (...),
i.e. (...), Oecumen. in loc. V. T. Deus in Templo Hierosol. Et super Acca
soederis in propitiatorio habitabat, sed tantummodo (...): at postquam venit
pleaitudo temporis toto pleaitutudo Deitatis, non (...), sed (...), vere modo
eminentissimo., and personaliter, in Christi natura humana inhabitat. Glass.
Philolog. S.
(...), i.e. (1.) Really, in opposition to al Types and Shadows. The Godhead
dwelt also in the Temple at Jerusalem, but it was only as in a Type of Christ's
human, and Mystic body. So v. 17. the Ceremonial rites are called shadows of
things to come, but the body is of Christ, i. e. Christ is the truth and
substance of al those Ceremonial Types: Thus also, Joh. 1.14. full of Grace and
Truth; and Joh. 4.24. in Spirit and in Truth: where truth seems to be opposed
to the ceremonial Shadows and Types. (2.) Bodily, i. e. Essentially and
Substantially, in opposition to men, or Angels. Thus the Greek (...) is used to
signify essence, according to the notion of (...), which is used for essence,
as well as body. It Is true, the Deity dwells essentially in every creature, in
some regard; and graciously in the Saints, Christ's mystic body, ay but, he
dwells in the human body of Christ in a far more essential, substantial, and
glorious manner: the Saints are not Godded, or made essentially and
substantially one with God; neither are they espoused, and married to God, by an
hypostatick Union, as the Human Nature of Christ is. Whence (3.) By Bodily, we
may understand personally: For so frequently, both in sacred and Profane
Authors, Body signifies a Person. Thus (...), Romans 12.1. imports persons. Then
he says, that all the plenitude of the Deity [dwelleth]. This seems to be an
allusion to the Divine Shekinah, or Inhabitation of the Deity, before
mentioned, Joh. 1.14. Look as God once had a visible, glorious residence in the
Holy of Holies, as in a Type of Christ's human nature, so he now dwells in
the Antitype, really, essentially, and personally: For, all the fulness of the
Deity dwells in Christ's human Nature, not only essentially, but also
personally, by virtue of the Hypostatick Union. And oh! what a glorious and
admirable Mystery is this, that Human Nature should be extended, and elevated
to such a raised capacity, and glorious dignity, as to be, by an Hypostatick,
personal union, espoused to the Son of God, and so become a Temple, wherein all the plenitude of the Deity dwells really, essentially, and personally? What?
does the fulness of the Deity so far condescend, as to come down, and dwell
bodily, or personally, in Human Nature? Is it possible that there should be
such a Name, and Thing as Godman? Oh! what an ineffable, incomprehensible,
unparalled Name, and Thing is this? What a glorious miracle, what an
astonishing wonder is Emmanuel, God with us, Mat. 1.23.
Mat. 1.23? Who can declare his generation? May not we conclude, with Augustine,
that our Emmanuel was the Angel, that said unto Manoah, Judge. 13.18. Why ask
thou after my name, seeing it is secret? or admirable, monderful. Is not every
letter, yea tittle, of this name Emmanuel, God with us, or God dwelling bodily
in Human Nature, beyond al mesure, wonderful? Oh! what infinite wonders of
condescendent love, what transcendent riches of Free Grace, are wrapped up in
this one Name Emmanuel? How could poor mortals, yea sinners, whose eyes are so
weak and dim, have ever hoped to behold the dazzling luster, and shining glories
of the Infinite Deity, had he not thus vouchsafed to come down, and dwell
bodily in human Nature? Are our bodily eyes so dim and weak, as that they
cannot, in a direct line, behold the Sun in its Noonday Glory, and brightness,
but must wait for some reflexe Image in a Basin of water, or some such glass?
how impossible then is it, for a created understanding, so much enfeebled by
sinful distillations, and humors, to contemplate the glorious, and dazzling
Deity, should he not reflect the beams, and luster of his shining Majesty, on
the Glass of Emmanuel's human Nature? Does not all this render Christ, God-man,
infinitely eligible for himself; seeing all the fulness of the Godhead dwells in
him bodily, really, essentially, personally? Surely, if all the beams of the
Father's love, Grace, and Glory center in the human Nature of Christ, and are
from him reflected on his friends, well may they elect him for himself:
deservedly is he the object of their contemplation, admiration, adoration, and
Fruition to al Eternity. O! how should the friends of Christ study, gaze on,
and ravish their hearts with so amiable, and glorious a friend, in whom dwells
all the fulness of the Godhead bodily? What an excellent, curious, rare piece of
work is this human Nature of Christ, formed and framed by the Spirit of God,
Luke 1.35? Give me leave to think, that there was more of God in the human
Nature of Christ, as Nature is a vessel coming out of the Porters house, than
ever was in Adam created according to Gods Image. Rutherfurd's Christ's Dying,
etc. p. 5.
How far does it outshine the Nature of Adam, even in his Innocent state? What
a noble Fabric is the human body of Christ, which was framed, and sanctified
by the overshadowing power of the most High? Of what a glorious make is
Christ's human soul, which was so curiously framed, adorned, and beautified
with such an infinite mass of pure Grace? In sum; what a glorious Temple must
Christ's Human Nature needs be, wherein the plenitude of the Deity dwells
bodily?

SECT. 4. The Explication of Heb. 1.3. Who being the brightness of his Glory,
and express Image of his Person, etc.
WE find another excellent Character of Christ's Mediatorie perfection, Heb.
1.3. Who Being the Brightness.
as relative to God the Father, in Heb. 1.3. Who being the brightness of his
Glory, and express Image of his Person, etc. Oh! what an admirable
Description is here? how weighty, and wonderful is every word hereof? (1.) Who
being the Brightness: (...), (...), Effulgentiae, relutentia. Greg. (...),
fulgidus, lucidus. Hesych.
the Effulgence, Splendour, Luster or shining brightness. Some take it to be a
figurative term, borrowed from luminous, or lightsome bodies, which
continually cast forth their rays, thereby to signify, that the Son of God,
procedes from the Essence of the Father, and is inseparably the same with him,
dwelling in his inaccessible Glory, and manifesting the same to the World. The
word, in its primary notation, signifies the splendour, or bright luster of the
Sun, in its Noontide Glory, either direct, or reflexe, as it appears in a
clear glass. Hence the Verb, whence it is immediately derived, signifies
(...), Naz. in Orat. de Pasch.

(...) accipitur etiam pro Die, ut apud Nicand. in There. See more Hen. Steph^
in (...).

(...), Refulgentia; quomodo radius a sole resplendet: unde non nulli
deradiationem vertunt. ^stius in locum.


the Sun's irradiating, and illuminating the World; and the original root is
sometimes used, to signify the splendour of the Sun, as it causes Day. A
learned Critic makes (...) here, to signify the reflection of the Divine
Majesty, such as is the parelius, or reflexe Image of the Sun, on an opposite
Cloud. Christ is indeed a Divine parelius of God, 'The Father (says Rutherford
on this Text) is as it were al Sun, and al pearl; the Son Christ is the
substantial rays, light-shining, the eternal, and essential irradiation of
this Sun of Glory. The Sun's Glory is manifested to the World, in the light
and beams that it sends out to the Word; and if the Sun should keep its beams
and light within its body, we should see nothing of the Sun's Beauty and
glory. No man, no Angel, could see any thing of God, if God had not had a
con-substantial Son, begotten of himself, by an eternal generation; but Christ
is the beams, and Splendour, the consubstantial shining of God; and as God
incarnate, he reveles the excellence, Glory, and Beauty of God:' Thus he.
This (...), Splendour, or Brightness of this Glory, may come under a double
consideration: (1.) It may be considered in regard of the Father, whence, by an
ineffable Generation, it eternally shone as light from light: so much the force
of the preposition here affixed does indicate: And look as the splendour of the
Sun, always attends the Sun, and cannot be plucked from it: So Christ, the
shining splendour of God the Father, is coeternal to him, and cannot be
separated from him. (2.) A second consideration of this shining splendour is in
regard of men, and the manifestation which the Father gives thereof by his Son.
Christ, the Splendour of his Father's Glory, was sent by him into this world,
to become incarnate, that so, in and by his human Nature, as an instrument, he
might illuminate, vivificate, and transform the Elect into the glorious Image
of God. Thus Christ is the splendour, or shining luster of his Father's Glory.
God the Father is in himself a light inaccessible, and full of Glory, 1 Timothy
6.16. dwelling in the light, which no man can approach unto, whom no man has
seen, nor can see: i. e. God is in himself invisible, too bright, and dazzling
and object for the sinners poor weak eye, to gaze on. Ay but now in Christ, who
is the splendour, or shining brightness of the Father's Glory, the Invisible God
becomes visible to an eye of faith here, and to a glorified eye in Heaven. As
the Sun, take it in its noonday glory, Objectum nimis excellens laedit
sensorium.
if you stand gazing on its shining luster and brightness, in a direct vision,
you will soon find it too bright, and dazzling on object for your weak eye: but
when there is a reflexe image of its luster, and shining brightness on a watery
cloud, which they call parelius, and seems another Sun, (more agreeable to our
weak eye, than the Sun it self) then you may stand gazing on that second Sun,
or the reflexe luster, and brightness of the Sun, as long as you please, without
damage to your eyes: Deus ipse procul absconditus lateret, nisi nos irradiaret
fulgor Christi: in hunc finem quicquid habet Pater apud unigenitum deposait, ut
in c^ patefaceret; ut ipsa bonorum communicatione exprim ret veram Gloriae suae
imaginem, Calv. Instit. fol. 106.
just so it is here; the Divine Essence or Deity, considered in its self, is
too dazzling and glorious an object for poor mortals to contemplate: should he
shine in his full brightness, with immediate, direct beams, on the Glass of our
weak understandings, alas! how soon should we be scorched and shrieveld to
nothing? how would our minds be quite swallowed up? Ay but now this Divine
splendour, and shining luster of the Father's glory being reflected from the
glass of Christ's human Nature, so it becomes very visible, and agreeable to a
sanctified eye of faith. Oh! what a glorious blessed Parelius, or image of God
the Father's Shining brightness, and glory, is Christ? What a beautiful,
pleasing glass is he, from whom all the bright beams, and shining luster of God
the Father's Glory, is, by means of the Gospel, (which is a second Glass)
reflected to the Glass of our ununderstandings? what a sweet, and glorious
contemplation is here for the friends of Christ? how should they stand, with
open faces, always, by a fixed eye of faith, gazing on the bright Shine, or
shining brightness of the Divine Glory, reflected from Christ, (that Parelius,
or original Glass) in and by the Gospel-glasse, to the living glass of their
renewed understandings, as 2 Cor. 3.18? The Divine Essence, though he be in
himself, and to the Glass of his own understanding, al light, and therefore is
called in Scripture the fountain of light; yet, in regard of poor mortals, he
is a light inaccessible, and therefore he is described, Psalm. 18.9, 11.
Psalm. 18.9. with darkness under his feet; and v. 11. He made darkness his secret
place, etc. to denote, that albeit he were al light in himself, yet, as to
fallen, sinful man, he is al darkness, or altogether unintelligible, out of
Christ. Christ is the shining brightness of the Glory of his Father: i. e. the
person in the Deity, by whom only the eternal wisdom of God could impresse
his Majesty upon any Creature: neither was it ever possible that any Creature
should show forth the goodness of God, but only by the person of the Son.
Deering on Heb. 1.10.
The Deity indeed is so deep a mystery, and so greatly remote form finful
flesh and blood, as that, had he not vouchsafed to deposite the luster of his
glory, in the only begotten Son Emmanuel, and through the veil of his flesh,
to beam forth some rays of his glory, on poor sinful us; Who could ever hope
to have the least glimpse of this shining brightness? It Is this day star that
must arise and conduct benighted sinners, those who loge in the Region of
darkness, unto the sight, and fruition of the Father of Lights. So Joh. 14.7. If
you had known we, Joh. 14.7, 8, 9.
you should have known the Father likewise: and from henceforth ye know him,
and have seen him: i. e. in Me, who am the brightness of his Glory. (...) non
solum radios signifitat, sed and emanationem ac processionem, ut interim
proprietas filii, qui a patre procedit ac gignit, infinuet. Oecolamp. in Heb.
1.3.
The Father, who is in himself invisible, and inaccessible, becomes accessible,
and visible to Faith. Philip ignorantly demands, v. 8. Lord, show us the
Father, and it suffices us. Our Lord replies, with a rebuke, v. 9. Have I been
so long time with you, and yet know thou not me, etc? As if he had said:
Why, this seems strange, and a symtome of great ignorance, that I should have
been so long with you, and yet all this while thou have not known the Father.
Surely, if thou had known me, thou had known the Father also: for he that
has seen me, has seen the Father; the brightness of whose Glory shines in me.
Thus we see how Christ is the fulgor, splendour, and luster or shining brightness
of God the Father.

(2.) Let us a little examine the following notion [Glorie] Christ, as God-man,
(...), of his Glory.
is not only the Brightness of God the Father, but the Brightness of his Glory.
Glory imports these severals: (1.) A superlative Excellence: See Sibs on 2
Cor. 3.18.
For nothing is glorious but what is, in some high degree, excellent: (2.) A
bright manifestation, or shining evidence: (...) vero plerumque abundans and
copiosa lux est, in qua divinitas apparuit vel etiam Augustius quid. Oecolamp,
in Heb. 1.3.
For nothing is glorious, as to us, (though it be excellent) unless it be
manifested to be such: hence the shining light of the Sun, is said to be
glorious, because it brings with it the glory of the Sun, and manifests the
same, by darting forth its rays, which run into our eyes. (3.) Glory is so
victorious, and convictive, as that, usually, it has a commun vogue, and
approbation of others; or else it loses the end of its manifestation. Thus the
glorious beams, and shines of the Sun are universally approved by all that have
eyes to see it: whence other things and Persons, that pretend to glory, borrow
their Titles of honor from the glorious light of the Sun; so Augustus comes
from (...), the luster of the Sun; as Illustris from lustro, and this from lux,
or luceo, I shine.
Augustus, illustris, clarus, etc. Now al these Attributes of Glory are, in
the highest degree, applicable to the Glory of God; which is the splendour,
luster, or shine of al God's transcendent Attributes, and excellences, and so
carries with it the most superlative excellence, the most convictive evidence,
and the most victorious approbation, of al such as have a sanctified, renewed
eye to behold it. Such is the Glory of God, whereof Christ, as God-man, is
said to be the shining brightness. The several Theaters of God's Glory.
It Is true, the Glory of God has many Theater and Stages, whereon it acts, and
displayeth it self: there is much of the Glory of God's Wisdom, Power, and
Goodness shines on the Theater of the visible World, as Romans 1.20. But there is
more of his Glory discovers it self on the Theater of the Gospel, and
Gospel Ordinances: Here shines the glory of his Grace, and its soul-pleasing
discoveries: but yet there is a greater impresse, and manifestation of God's
Glory on the Theater of the New Creature, or renewed soul; If a man look on
the Creatures he sees there God's Vestigia or footsteps of power, etc. If on
the Saints and Angels, God's Image of holiness; if on Christ, there God himself,
2 Cor. 4.4, 5, 6. She herd, Parable of the Virgins. fol. 76.
Where shines the Divine Nature, or Image of God: and yet farther, there is an
higher manifestation of the Divine Glory, on the Theater, of the Celestial
World, of Glorified Saints and Angels; where shines Grace triumphant, and
victorious, in noonday glory, without the least spot; where also those
glorified spirits are clothed with their best robes, of immediate, direct,
intuitive Vision of the Blessed Deity, as he is, face to face. But yet al
these several ascents, and raisures of created Glory, come infinitely short of
that shining Brightness of the Father's Glory, which manifests it self on the
Theater of our Emmanuel, the only begotten Son of God. But I shall wind up this
part of Christ's character, with that excellent Annotation of Judicious
Deering, on these words, Heb. 1.3. Who being the Brightness of his Glory. 'This
Title is absolutely given him as essential to the Son of God, not only before
us, but before his Father also; that as all the Properties of the Godhead have
their Being in the person of the Father; so the brightness, and beauty of them,
is in the person of the Son; and so this name was proper to him before the
world was made; noting, that eternally he was of the Father, so John 1.1.
Touching us, he is called the brightness of his Father's Glory, many ways, as
(1.) Because in our Nature he showed forth the lively countenance of his
Father, in all fulness of Grace and truth, Joh. 1.14. and (2.) Because in the
power of his Word, he wrought mightily in all creatures, Joh. 5.30. (3.) And
again St. Paul calls him, 2 Cor. 3.18. the Image (which is the shining
brightness) of God, in respect of the clear manifestation of the Gospel, in
which he has set out so glorious a light of the power of God to save sinners.
So he is to us the Brightness of glory, because many ways he showed forth the
Glory of God his Father unto us, as Joh. 1.18.' Thus he. How the brightness of
al God's glorious Attributes, shine in Christ as Emmanuel, we shall, God
willing, show in what follows, on 2 Cor. 4.6. Now, does nor this effulgence,
splendour, luster or Brightness of the Father's Glory, which shines in Christ,
render him infinitely eligible for himself? How much does this substantial
reflection of the Father's brightness, and glory transcend those accidental
reflections of the Father's Glory in glorified Saints and Angels? See Dr.
Owen, his Explication of this Text.

(3.) We come now to the latter part of Christ's Character, Heb. 1.3. Express
Image.
Heb. 1.3. and express Image of his person, (...), nota impressa, vel
insculpta, aut inseripta: unde (...), idem quod (...), apud Arist. pol. l. 1.

(...), Character: which, in its first notation, imports a note impressed,
inscribed, or engraven. Thence it is used to signify the stampes, or impresses
of Letters on Tables, or of a Seal on Wax: Whence also it signifies an
Effigies, Figure, or Image. Hence lastly, it is some times taken for a
Description, whereby a thing is described, as it were by a note, or marque
impressed on it; which distinguishes it from al things else. In all these
regards, Christ, as God-man, may be said to be the character of his Father's
Person. (1.) Are not all the letters, yea, every title of God the Father's
essential perfections inscribed, and engraven in most glorious, and legible
characters, on our Emmanuel? (2.) Is not Christ, the only begotten Son of God,
the substantial Type, Stamp, or Impresse of God the Father's Personal, and
Essential Glory? (3.) Yea, is not Christ, as God-man, the essential Effigies,
Figure, and Image of God the Father? And, (4.) Is not Christ also the Divine
Word, or an essential Description of God the Father, whereby he is infinitely
distinguished from al things else? Some, Glassius Rhet. Sacr.
by Character here (which comes from (...), to engrave) understand, not so much
the Image of the Seal impressed on the Wax, as the Seal it self; insomuch as
the Father has stamped his whole Essence, and Majesty most intimately on his
Son, eternally begotten of himself; in whom his substantial Image shines. Which
Explication is conceived to agree best with this Mystery, its fruit and
effcacie; namely, as it expounds the secret of Christ's eternal generation.
Farther, this notion expresses God the Father's affection toward Christ: for
the seal is preserved among our choicest Jewels; such as we affect and value
most: thus the Father's most fervent love terminates on his only begotten Son,
his substantial Seal, or Image, as Haggai 2.23. and will make thee as a Signet,
wherein he is a Type of Christ. Lastly, this Idea of a Character, or Seal, as
applied to Christ, imports the whole Oeconomie of his mediatorie office: the
Seal impressed on the Wax leaves an Image; and moreover gives an obsignation,
and assurance of what is conveyed thereby: Christ is that signatorie Ring, or
celestial Seal, who has, and that from eternity, the most express Image of
his Fathers Glory, and Majesty impressed on him, and thence being sent into
the World, as the Prince of Salvation, he assures life to all the Elect. The
Pagan Orator tells us, (...), Demesthenes.
That the Character, or descriptive Image, of the soul is seen in ^s words; and
is not Christ, the Substantial, Essential, and Divine Word, a perfect Idea, or
express character of the Father's Person, wherein his Essential Glory,
otherwise invisible, becomes visible to an eye of faith? Again, when Christ is
said to be the Character or express Image, hereby is also denoted the
permanence and subsistence of the Deity in Christ: he is not a superficial,
transient Image, but an express, lively, subsistant, and essential character,
or Idea of the Father's person; as a Child that bears the Image of his Father,
and partakes of the same nature with him. In that he calls Christ (...): i. e.

the Character, it is much more emphatick, than if he had said, an Image: For
there appears in a Glass the Image of a thing, but not the character; which
denotes a true, solid, lively form, or express Image, exactly representing
the Archetype, as the character of the Seal impressed on Wax. So that
character here imports, that Christ is a most perfect, adequate, absolute,
essential, and express Image of God; such as gives a most certain and evident
representation of his Father, answerable to Phil. 2.6. where he is said to be
in the Form of God. which implies more than a figure, or bare Image; namely,
an essential character. It Is true, there are some He is the engraven form of
the person of the Father: noting hereby the Unity of substance, as in whom the
Fulness of the Godhead dwells bodily, Col. 1.9. Even as Paul calls him, the Image
of God, distinguishing him by this name from al shadows, Heb. 10.1. Deering on
Heb. 1.3.
stampes, impresses, or dark characters of God on the Visible, sensible World:
There was also a more legible and fair character, or Image of God on Adam's
soul in Innocence: There is yet a more noble character, or Impresse of the
Divine Glory on Glorified Saints, and Angels: but yet al these characters are
infinitely short of our Emmanuel, as he is the substantial character, or
express Image of his Father's Person; which notes, not only an unity in
Quality, but in Substance; not only similitude, but also Indentitie, or
samenes in essence; as also Paritie and Equality in Glory. Thus Christ is the
Character of his Father's person; which also renders him infinitely eligible
for himself. But how Christ is the Image of his Father's Person, will farther
appear in what follows on 2 Cor. 4.4, 6.

SECT. 5. The Explication of 2 Cor. 4.6, 4.
WE find another great Character of Christ, 2 Cor. 4.6. In the Face of Jesus.
as he is the express Image of his Father's Glory, 2 Cor. 4.6. For God, who
commanded the light to shine out of darkness, has shined in our hearts, to give
the light of the knowledge of the Glory of God, in the face of Jesus Christ.
Here are several gradations, which render the whole, but especially Christ, the
center of the whole, very beautiful, and glorious. (1.) He says, that God, who
commanded the light to shine out of darkness, has shined in our hearts. Paul
here counts al his notional knowledge before Conversion, but darkness; yea, such
thick darkness as was upon the face of the Chaos, before God Created light, Genesis
1.2. So that nothing but the creative power of God, could bring saving light
out of his confused, pharisaick darkness. It Is true, he had head-knowlege
before: ay but now, says he, God has shined in our hearts, and made them a
living Glass: for what? Why, (2.) To give the knowledge of God. Yea, (3.) The
light, [ i. e. the clear, and evident manifestation] of the knowledge of God.
The face of Christ What?
But how is this possible? Surely no way but, (4.) In the face of Jesus Christ.
Per Angelum faciei Jehorae, Esa. 63.9. Filius Dei intelligitur, dictus faciei
ipsius Angelus, quia est ille, qui visibili specie columnae s^il nubis, and
ignis Israelitas in deserto duxit, and saciem Dei quast consp^ci^a^ populo
f^it: id^quod Jehovae ipsi ad cribitur, Exodus 14.24. Alii appellationem hanc
illi dafam esse volunt, quod, (...), Col. 1.15. Glass. Rhetor. s.
The Face is the most celestial, beautiful, majestic, lovely, and visible part
in a man's body; wherein the invisible Characters, and Dispositions of the
soul are often very visible: if there be any goodlines, or excellence in the
creature, it usually appears very far in the face. By face here we may
understand the whole Form of Christ as Mediator. (...), Hebraeis, id omne
significat quod sensibus exterioribus perci itar, Giot. in l.
So (...) answers to the Hebr. (...), which signifies all that, which is obvious
to externe sense; and in general, the whole person. Whence the Face of a man is
frequently in the Scripture-Phrasiologie, put for his whole person: so, to
accept the Person, is in the Original, to accept the face, Luke 20.21. as
elsewhere, because the excellences of the person shine most in the face. Much
of the Majesty, Glory, beauty, and lovelines of a man shines in his face.
Thus Christ is the face of God. Oh! What an infinite Majesty, beauty, and
Glory does there shine in Christ? How lovely, amiable, sweet, and
heart-ravishing are the manifestations of God in Christ? Alas! what is there to
be seen of God, but what shines in Christ? Is not al God, and whole God
manifest in the face of Christ? May we expect the least mediatorie
manifestation of the Divine Love, Grace, and Mercy, but in the Son? Is there
not a confluence of all the lovely qualities, all the drawing Attributes, all the
ravishing Beauties of the Deity in Christ? And does not the contemplation of
these glorious perfections, which shine in the face of Christ, draw life out of
Death; beauty out of deformity; strength out of infirmity; order out of
confusion; happiness out of misery; yea, Heaven out of Hell? Thus in the face of
Christ, the Majesty, Beauty, Amenitie, Amiablenes; Grace, with the other
Divine Characters, and Invisible Glories of God the Father, become visible, and
intelligible to the renewed mind. It Is confessed, there is much of the glorious
light, or knowledge of God, shines in the Face of the creatures; and more in the
Face of the Ceremonial, and Moral Law; and yet more in the Face of the Gospel,
and Gospel Ordinances; and yet more in the Faces of Believers, and glorified
Saints. But alas! What are al these Faces, if compared with the glorious,
lovely face of our Emmanuel, but mere deformities, yea nothing? Oh! What a
beautiful glorious face has this Son of God, who can with one glance thereof,
make al in Heaven, and Earth to smile? yea, ravish and overcome the hearts of
his worst enemies? Oh! What an heart-charming, and victorious Beauty must
there be in his face, where all the ravishing glories, and excellences of the
Godhead center? Hammond on this place: and Beza: Alludit perset^o ad Mosis
taciem illam non anertam (ut clara esset D^i Imago, c 3.13.) sed operram. Beza
in l.
Some will have this Phrase, [The face of Jesus Christ] to refer to the Story
of Moses, desirous to see the Glory of God, Exodus 33.18, etc. with which
sight, Moses's face was irradiated, and became glorious; yea, so glorious, that
the purblind Israelites could not contemplate the same: ay but now the face of
Jesus Christ has another-gets irradiation, than Moses's had; all the essential,
and substantial rays of the Father's Glory, shine in this lovely face. 2 Cor.
4.4. Image of God.
Hence v. 4. He is called the Image of God. (...) ocant Graec^, non quanvie
picturam, sed quae sit vivi instar, Unde Iconic^^pictores, quos v^l^o voramus
qui peignent au vif. Beza.
The Excellence of a thing is seen in its Image, or picture, if well drawn: (1.)
Christ is the essential, substantial, and most lively Image of God the Father:
in his face, as God-man, shines all the glorious Attributes of God: as you have
often in the Child's face, a living Image, or Ressemblance of the Parent. It Is
true, there are some vestigia, or footsteps of God in the sensible World; ay,
but the Image of God is not there: Imago est Repraesentatio causae quantum ad
similitnainem formae, non solum causalitatis, quod pertinet ad Vestigium,
Aquin. Sum.
Vestigia, or footsteps have only some Impresses, or notices of causalitie;
but an Image is a Representation of a cause, according to the similitude of his
form, and not only of his causalitie. Again, Adam had, and the Saints here
have, though imperfectly (as the Saints in Heaven perfectly have) the Image of
God shining on them: ay but, all this is but a created, Accidental Image, or a
similitude in Quality, or the accidental form of Grace: (...) accip^tur etiam
pro ipsa essentiali similitudine. Beza, in Heb. 10.1
it is Christ alone that is the increated, substantial Image, of the Father's
Glory: he is clothed with the specifiek form (if we may so speak in the
Schools Dialect) or with, not only a similitude, but Unity of the Divine
Essence: his Likeness to God the Father consists, not in an Accidental,
imperfect, but in a substantial and perfect Unity, or Identitie of Essence.
Thus Christ is the essential Image of God, as the plenitude of the Deity dwells
in him personally, and essentially. (2.) Christ may be styled the Image of God,
in regard of (...) i. e. in quo sci^sum perspicue conspiciendum praebet Deus,
nec allo quam officii ipsius respectu (...)] aliqui libri addunt (...), ut
indicetur Deam alio juin incomprehensib^lem in Christo tamen conspici. Beza, in
l.
manifestation; as the Glory of the invisible God, becomes in, and by Christ
visible to an eye of faith: wherefore some copies add here to God, (...),
invisible: i. e. God, who is in his own nature invisible, or incomprehensible,
does in Christ, his essential Image, become visible to the believing world. So
it answers to Col. 1.15. where Christ is called the Image of the invisible God:
Namely, because, as the species, form, and figure of a man is known by his
Image: so in, and by Christ, the wisdom, power, mercy, and Grace, with all the
other Attributes of God, are made manifest. Hence the Hebrews call their
Messiah, (...), the Image of God.

SECT. 6. Christ an Essential Glass, wherein all the Glory of the Deity
shines, and from which it is reflected on the Believing World, 2 Cor. 3.18.
With the Explication.
THE like excellent Character of Christ we have, 2 Cor. 3.18. In a Glass.
2 Cor. 3.18. But we al with open face, beholding as in a Glass the Glory of
the Lord, are changed into the same Image, etc. We have here a parallel
Antithesis betwixt the Grace of the Gospel, and the Law. Under the Law the
Grace of God was veiled, and wrapped up in Types and Shadows, which were but a
dark adumbration; but under the Gospel, the Glorious Grace of God shines as in
a Glass. A Glass, Speruium, praeter Intem and colorem, etiam expressam
imaginem reflectit. Keck. Optic.
besides light and color, reflects the express Image of its object. Imago in
Specuio est forma speculi. Estius in l.
Yea, the Image in a glass is the very form of the Glass: and therefore the
word here used, signifies to contemplate his form in a glass. (...), Vocat
speculum Apostolus filium Dei in carne manifestatum. qui nobis in ipsius
Evangelio spectandus proponiter, and Mosi velato opponitur. Beza in locum.
The Son of God incarnate is the orignal glass, wherein all the Glory of God,
is to be contemplated by believers, and that with open face; in opposition to
Moses's covered face. By the glory of God, we are to understand all the
glorious Attributes of God, as his Wisdom, Goodness, Grace, Holiness, Justice,
Mercy, etc. Which are al to be seen in Christ, as a man's face is seen in a
Glass. The blessed Deity has (as we may speak) deposited al his glorious
rays, or Attributes in Christ, that Essential glass: His wisdom, mercy,
justice, etc. is no where so visible as here: There is no saving ray of Glory
darted from the Creator to the Creature, but what is reflected from this Divine
Glass. Albeit the Essential Attributes of God are in all the three persons of
the Trinity, yet the Mediatorie irradiation of these Attributes, is only in
the Son, in whom they al meet, as in an Universal, Essential Glass. There are
variety of Glasses, wherein the Glory of God shines: Some rays of his
glorious wisdom, power, and goodness, shine in the Glass of the Creatures:
some beams of his holiness, and purity shine in the Glass of the Moral Law:
the Glory of his Grace is seen in the Glass of the Gospel, and Evangelick
Administrations: Yea, Hell it self is a glass, wherein shines the Glory of
God's Justice, as in Heaven, and Believers, the glory of his mercy, and
grace. But al these are but created, partial, and dim glasses, in comparison of
Christ, who is an increated, universal, and most bright Miroir, or Glass of
the Father's Glory. We may suppose, for illustration sake, an universal,
living, transforming Glass, such in which all the beams of the Sun, that ever
were, or shall be, or possibly may be, are contacted; whence, shining upon the
world, it should, by its Vivisick transformative Efficacy, not only conveigh
the glory of the Sun, but change dead Creatures into so many glorious, living
Suns; surely this would be a very glorious Glass: How the believing foul is
transformed into the glorious Image of God shining in Christ.
Such an Universal, living, transformative glass is Christ: all the beams of
the glorious Deity are contracted in him: neither ever did, or shall, or may
there any one soul-saving ray of the Diving glory shine upon the dark, sinful
world, but what is reflected from this glorious glass: Yea, such is its
vivifick, transformative efficacy, as that those, who by a sanctified eye of
faith, behold the glory of God therein, are transformed into the same Image,
etc. Jesus Christ, God-man, having all the glorious Ideas of God's Image, and
Grace, shining in him, as in a Glass, he reflects the same, in and by the
glass of the Gospel, on the hearts of Believers; who by faith contemplating
the same, are, by the efficacious working of the Spirit of grace, transformed
into the same glorious Image, even from Glory to Glory, i. e. from one degree
of glorious Grace unto another. Thus the believing soul, by faith contemplating
the wisdom, meeknes, patience, kindness, justice, (etc.) of God, shining in
Christ, is, by the effectual concurrence of the Spirit of Christ, transformed
into a wise, meek, patient, kind, and just spirit. Faith, by contemplating the
Glory of God in Christ, brings into the soul, spiritual Ideas of the same
glorious Image, a divine light and life, bearing some Ressemblance to the life
of God, or Divine Nature. So that Christ, the essential glass of God, has nor
only a manifestative, but also a transformative, changing glory, shining in
him.

Christ ressembles best your vitreous Miroirs, Christ ressembled to a Miroir.
or locking-glasses, which reflect the Image most lively: for glass, because
it is rare and pellucid, receives the Species or Image with more facility; but
by reason of its pelluciditie, it does not so easily fix, and retain the Image
received: wherefore Art succurring Nature, to the Glass she adds lead, or
quicksilver; which, by reason of its densitie, fixes the Image received by
the Glass: This indeed is a lively shadow of our Emmanuel, as he is the
miroir, or Looking-glass of God the Father's glorious Image: For his Deity
is, as it were, the glass, which is most pellucid and clear; and his Human
Nature is, as it were, the lead or quicksilver, which fixes the Image of the
Father's glory, and so makes it reflexible to us. Such a glorious miroir or
Looking-glass of the Father's glory is Christ, as God-man: and how infinitely
eligible for himself does this render him? What? do all the rays of the
Father's glorious Attributes center on Christ? Is there not any one beam of the
Glory of God, shining on the sinful World, with the saving light of life, but
what is reflected from this living, transforming, glorious glass, God-man? Oh
then! What a pleasing thing is it, to have an eye of faith fixed on this
glorious Miroir, or Looking-glass, whereon all the Father's Glory shines? Oh!
what a sweet death is it, to have the sanctified mind stand gazing on this
Glorious, heart-transforming glass, til its eye-strings even break, by
continued Contemplation, Admiration, Adoration, and Fruition of those soul-
ravishing perfections, that shine therein? who would not cry Sorrow, Shame and
Hell upon al those, who will not elect our Emmanuel, the substantial glass of
the Deity, for himself? Ah! What an Hell is it to reject him? Believe it, there
is no life so pure, so holy, so lovely, so sweet, so flourishing, so active, so
generous, so noble, so harmonious, so glorious, so admirable, so perfect; as
that which is most spent in the spiritual Intuition, or fiducial Vision,
Election, and Fruition of the glorious Image of God, which shines in this
Glass God-man. He that would have a dead, barren, hard, backsliding heart,
transformed into a lively, fruitful, tender, flourishing heart, let him come
hither, and be much in the spiritual contemplation of Gods glorious Attributes,
which shine in this Glass, Christ.

SECT. 7. How all the Attributes of God shine in Christ: namely his Wisdom,
Goodness, Justice, Holiness, Power, Truth, Omnipotence, Independence, etc.
WE have shown in the general, How all the Attributes of God shine in Christ?
how all the glorious Perfections of God shine in Christ, as in a Temple, where
the Deity dwells bodily; as on a Theater, where all the shining Brightness of the
Father's Glory is displayed; as in a character of the Father's Person; as in a
Face, and Image, wherein appears the Beauty, and excellence of God; and as in
a Glass, which reflects all the glorious Beams of the Divine Attributes: But
now to take some particular view, and consideration of those glorious
Attributes of God, which shine in Christ as God-man, will greatly conduce to the
explication, and Demonstration of our conclusion, that Christ is eligible for
himself. In the general, the Attributes of God may be said to shine in Christ,
(1.) Objectively, as he was the object-matter, or Theater, on which they acted;
or (2.) Formally, as they al reside in him; or (3.) Effectively, as issuing
from him, and acting on the Creature. We shall consider them, though very
briefly, under al these regards.

1. 1. God's Wisdom shines in Christ. 1. Objectively.
The Infinitely glorious Wisdom of God, shines most glorious in Christ: and
that (1.) Objectively; in that Divine Wisdom found out such an admirable
contrivement, for the reconcilement of Mercy and Justice, Sinners and God, by
the Mediation, and Satisfaction of God-man. Oh! What a glorious design of
Infinite Wisdom, does there appear in Christ's coming to save sinners, beyond
what is manifest in all the other works of God? Does not the shining Brightness
of God's wisdom, in this great plot of Redemtion by Christ, much outshine,
yea seem, comparatively, to cast a veil on that wisdom, which shines in all
other works of God. Surely, if it be lawful to make comparisons between the
works of God, this of Redemtion by Christ, was the masterpiece of Divine
Wisdom. 2. Formally.
(2.) The Wisdom of God shines in Christ formally, as all the treasures of
wisdom are loged in him. Colos. 2.3. In whom are hid all the Treasures of
Wisdom and Knowledge. 3. Effectively.
(3.) The Wisdom of God shines in Christ effectively, as all that Divine
Wisdom, which is communicated to the Saints, flows from him. 1 Cor. 1.30. But
of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made to us Wisdom, etc.

2. 2. The goodness, love, grace and mercy of God shines in Christ,
The Infinite Glory of God the Father's Goodness, Love, Grace, and Mercy
shines most gloriously in our Emmanuel: and that, 1 Objectively.
(1.) Objectively: Christ is the highest expression of Divine Goodness, the
richest token of the Father's love, the most glorious monument of God's free
Grace vouchsafed to his Creature, and the most admirable Miracle of soverain
Mercy toward sinners, that ever was, or may be. The blessed God has taken
great delight, on al occasions, to vouchsafe sensible Demonstrations, and
Arguments of his Divine Philanthropie, or Bounty, and Good Nature toward Man:
yea, al those rich ornaments, and gracious Accomplishments, or vouchsafements
conferred on Adam in Innocence, were but the Effects of his free Grace; though
in some regard they may be termed natural to Adam's first state. And since the
Fall, the blessed Lord has not ceased to vouchsafe large tokens of his Divine
Philanthropie, or Bounty to his rebellious creature. Ay, but this unparalleld
gift of his only begotten Son, is the highest marque of favor, and the richest
manifestation of infinite Love, free Grace, and Mercy, that poor sinners are
capable to receive. Well therefore might our Emmanuel cry out, Joh. 3.16. For
God so loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son. This little S O, is
such a great note, and marque of Divine Philanthropie, as that the lengths,
breadths, depths, and heights of this Love, cannot be expressed, or conceived,
as they ought, to al Eternity. 2. Formally.
(2.) The Love, Mercy, and Grace of God, shine in Christ Formally, as he is a
perfect Idea, or Miroir of Divine Love and Grace. As also (3.) 3. Effectively.
Effectively, as all the Love and Grace of God the Father, streameth through his
heart, unto the Elect, Joh. 1.16.

3. God's Justice shines in Christ.
The Infinite Glory of God the Father's Divine Justice shines most eminently in
Christ: (1.) Objectively, as he was the Object, or But, against which all the
arrows of God's fiery indignation for sin, were shot. We have great Marquis of
Divine Justice on Cain, and Judas; and yet far more dreadful tokens thereof in
Hell: but yet we may safely affirm, that all the black curses of the Law, which
their executions on sinners here; yea, that all the dreadful torments of the
damned in Hell, are nothing nigh so clear, and ample Demonstrations of God's
Justice, and Severitie against sin, as the sufferings of our dying Emmanuel. O!
come near, and behold the Soverain pleasure of God the Father, in bruising his
only begotten Son, and making his soul an offering for sin, Esa. 53.10. Oh!
what a standing, glorious monument of Divine Justice against sin, is this red
Glass of Christ's blood? Herein we may behold God the Father's Justice, as it
were, triumphing over his natural, essential love to his only begotten Son.
(2.) Again, the Justice of God shines in Christ, formally, as also (3.)
Effectively, in that al justice originally inheres in, and flows from him.

4. God's Holiness shines in Christ. 1 Objectively.
The Infinite Glory of God's Holiness shines, with a most transcendent
Brightness, in Christ: (1.) Objectively, and Demonstratively, as God, by making
his soul an offering for sin, gave the highest Demonstration that can be, of
his Infinite, Antipathie and Hatred against Sin. Yea it is supposed, and that
on good reasons, That if Infinite wisdom should set it self on work never so
much, to find out an Argument to manifest God's hatred of sin, there could not
be a greater, than this his dealing with his Son. 2. Formally.
(2.) God's Holiness dwells in Christ formally, as he is a perfect Idea, Miroir,
or Glass of al Holiness, infinitely beyond glorified Saints, or Angels; and
therefore styled, The Holy One. 3. Effectively.
(3.) God's Holiness shines in Christ effectively, as all the Saints Holiness is
derived from him, Joh. 1.16.

5. The power of God shines in Christ.
The Infinite Glory of God's power shines most eminently in Christ: 1.
Objectively: no work or effect of God's hand has such visible impresses of
God's Omnipotence stamped on it, as the Hypostatick Union of the Divine and
Human Nature, in one person: whence it is called the power of the most high.
Besides, Infinite power shined most gloriously in his Miracles,
Soul-sufferings, Death, and Resurrection, more than in the Creation of Heaven
and Earth. (2.) The omnipotence. of God resides formally in Christ, as the
proper seat thereof. (3.) The omnipotence of God the Father shines most
effectively in all Christ's great works of Redemtion, Conversion, Conservation,
Protection, and Gubernation of his Church, etc. Col. 1.11. Strenthened with all
might, according to his glorious power.

6. The truth, and faithfulness of God shines in Christ.
The Truth and Faithfulness of God the Father shines most gloriously in Christ:
(1.) Objectively, in that Christ was the greatest Promise that ever God gave to
lost sinners; yea, in him all the Promises are Yea and Amen: So that in sending
him into the World, to die for sinners, God made good that great promise, made
four thousand years before, Genesis 3.15. Yea, by this means all the promises of
God are fulfilled. Whence the Veracitie, and Fidelity of God appears most
conspicuous, and bright in Christ's coming into the World, etc. And this
indeed is one of the greatest aggravations of unbelief; that, when the
Faithfulness of God has so gloriously appeared, in fulfilling that great Promise
of sending his Son, the accomplishment whereof was attended with such a world
of difficulties; I say, that after this, sinners should disbelieve, or question
the Faithfulness of God in fulfilling other promises, which have their Yea and
Amen in Christ, Gal. 3.16. Again (2.) The Truth of God appears most glorious in
Christ Formally, in that he has; to a tittle, made good al his promises. As
Christ was the great Gift, and Promise of God the Father, so the Spirit is the
great Promise, and Gift of Christ, Joh. 14, 16, 17, 18.26. And is not Christ
every way as good as his word, in sending his Spirit? is there any one promise
that Christ made his friends, at his Departure hence, but has been, and daily
is fulfilled to a tittle? (3.) The Faithfulness of God shines in Christ
effectively, in that he makes and keeps al his friends faithful, and steadfast
in their Covenant with him.

7. Christ the Image of God's Immensitie and omnipresence.
Christ is a glorious Idea and Image of the Immensitie, and Omnipresence of
God, as Joh. 3.13. The Son of man which is in Heaven. The expression is very
mysterious, and deserves a particular Remarque: How was the Son of man in
Heaven? Joh. 3.13.
Was he not then on earth, discoursing with them? or, could he be both in
Heaven, and on Earth at the same time? Yes, he might, in different respects,
and by virtue of the Hypostatick Union: it is true, his body, being finite,
could not, as some fondly dream, be in two places at the same time; that
implies no less than a contradiction: ay, but yet Christ, God-man, by virtue
of the personal Union of the two Natures, was at that very time, while he was
discoursing with them on Earth, in Heaven. Oh! what a tremendous mystery is
this, that the Son of man should be, at the same time in Heaven, and on Earth?
How difficult, yea impossible is this to be understood, without understanding
some thing of the Hypostatick Union! But yet that thus it is, this Scripture
makes it clear: and hence it follows, that God's Omnipresence, which is one of
his incommunicable Attributes, must be, in like manner, attributed to our
Emmanuel, as he is God-man, though not in regard of his manhood. The like Luke
22.69.

8. Christ an Idea of God's Independence.
Our Emmanuel, as God-man, is a glorious Idea, and Miroir of God the Father's
Independence. This is another of God's incommunicable Attributes, which yet is
deservedly given to, and assumed by Christ, Joh. 5.26. Joh. 5.26.
So has he given to the Son to have life in himself. Christ's Human Nature,
and al its glorious accomplishments have Dependence on none but Christ himself:
all the Personal, and Mediatorie excellences of our Emmanuel depend upon no
other, than his very Person.

9. Christ the Idea of all the other incommunicable Attributes of God.
The same may be affirmed of all the other incommunicable Attributes of God,
namely of his Al-sufficience, his Simplicity, his Immutabilitie, his
Eternity, his Infinitude, his Incomprehensibilitie; of al which Christ is a
most glorious Idea, Character, Image, Temple, and Glass, wherein they shine
with Infinite glory, and brightness; and whence they are reflected on the eye
of faith.

SECT. 8. Several particular Improvements of this first Character, of Christ's
Mediatorie excellences.
HAving largely demonstrated, The application of all the foregoing Characters of
Christ.
how all the glorious Ideas of God's Attributes shine in Christ, as God-man, the
Temple, Theater, Splendour, Character, Face, Image, and Miroir, or Glass of the
Father's Glory; what remains, but that we now contract al these shining and
flaming rays, in a burning glass of some useful meditations, thereby to
inflame the hearts of Christ's friends, to study, contemplate, elect, and
enjoy this their Emmanuel for himself.

1. 1. Contemplate those glorious Ideas that shine in Christ.
Is the Glory of the Lord reveled? and may al flesh see it together, in this
our Emmanuel; as Esa. 40.5? O then! come hither al flesh, come, and behold the
most glorious Ideas, Characters, and Images of the Father's Glory, shining so
brightly, and yet so sweetly, so pleasingly, so agreably, in this Increated,
eternal, universal, Infinite, transforming Miroir, or Glass of Christ,
God-man. The old saying under the Law was, that no man can see God and live:
This holds true still, if we consider God out of Christ: Pater qui imm^nsus est,
in filio finitus est: quia s^^a^ modulum nostrum accommodavit, ne meats nost
as Imm ^nsitat^ suae Glo^ae absurbeat. Calvin
Ay but now, God the Father, who is in himself infinite, invisible, and
unintelligible, is, in this our Emmanuel, visible, and intelligible: he has, in
this his Son, accommodated himself to our module and capaeitie; that so our
minds may not be swallowed up with the Immensitie of his Glory. O that the
friends of Christ would set him, who is the Divine Miroir, and Looking-glass
of all the Father's Glory, ever before their eyes, and never leave musing,
poring, contemplating on him, til they find their hearts transformed into a
flame of Divine love to, and delight in this their Emmanuel, for himself! O
that the friends of Christ would come, and pore on this glass; come, and look
into this Ark; come, and worship in this Temple; come, and gaze on this most
resplendent, and beautiful Face, in which shines all the Glory of the Deity!
Hear Christ himself making solemn Proclamation to his friends of the
New-Jerusalem, to come, Esa. 40.9.
and behold his Glory, Esa. 40.9. say unto the Cities of Judah, behold your
God! O come, and behold what wonders of Grace, Beauty, and Glory dwell in this
your God! Yea, he invites his Elect friends among the Gentiles, Esa. 65.1.
to come, and behold his Glory, Esa. 65.1. I am sought of them that asked not
for me, I am found of them that sought me not: I said, Behold me, Behold me,
etc. Christ seeks them, that seek not after him; he is found of them, that ask
not after him; and unto such he cries, Behold me! Behold me! The Doublement of
the Word, argues how desirous Christ is to exhibit his most beautiful, and
glorious face, to the contemplation of sinners. O then, come, come, behold,
behold this so glorious a face! Why will you not come? What an heart-ravishing
sight is here? The fixing of an eye of faith on Christ, in a way of spiritual
Meditation, and contemplation, what a mighty Soverain, Efficacious influence
has it, to ravish the heart into an admiration, and election of him for
himself? Ah! What a shame is it, that those, who profess themselves friends of
Christ, have no more raised, deep, fixed Apprehensions, of those glorious
excellences that shine in him? What deserves our most elevated contemplation,
and admiration, if not those glorious Ideas of Divine perfections, which meet,
and center in Christ? Is there any thing more admirable, more beautiful, more
heart-captivating, than the incomparable excellences of Christ? how comes it to
pass then, that he has no more eyes gazing on him, no more hearts ravished
with him, no more friends of, and for himself? Oh the folly, the madness, the
brutishnes of the blind World! Christus virtute unionis Hypostaticae etiam in
cruce pendens suit gloriosior omnibus creaturis, etiam Angelis gloriosissimis.
Twissus, Vind. Great.
Take Christ in his lowest humiliation, even when he hung upon the Cross, yet
even then, by virtue of the Hypostatick Union, he was infinitely more glorious,
and eligible for himself, than the most glorious creatures, even glorified
Angels: and yet how few beholders of his Glory has he? No wonder therefore,
that so few elect him for himself.

2. Election and fruition of those Glorious excellences that shine in Christ.
Does all the plenitude of the Deity dwell bodily in Christ, as in a Temple? Oh
then, what a Beautiful, glorious Temple is this? How should we admire, adore,
elect, serve, and enjoy the Deity, in this so glorious a Temple? what deserves
to be elected, and loved for it self, if not the Deity? Certainly, God must
needs be the most alluring, drawing, heart-ravishing thing that may be: for
when you say God, you say al: what can you say more? Again, is Christ the
Effulgence, Splendour, luster, or shining Brightness of the Father's Glory; yea,
the substantial, and so infinitely the fairest character of his person? And is
not this a mighty taking, alluring, drawing, binding character of Christ's
excellence; which lays an essential obligation on al his friends, to elect,
love, and enjoy him for himself? Farther, does all the Beauty, Amenitie,
Majesty, Sweetness, Amiablenes of God the Father, shine in the lovely Face of
Christ? Yea, he is the lively Image of all the Father's Glory? And must not
then the Friends of Christ elect, admire, and love this his so beautiful,
majestic, and yet sweet, heart-charming Face for it self? Does not this
substantial, essential Image of God, call for the highest Admiration, Adoration,
Election, and Affection? What deserves Admiration, and election for it self, if
not this first Beauty, and Image of God? Lastly, is our Emmanuel a Divine
Miroir, or Looking-glass, in which shines all the Glorious Attributes of God
the Father? Oh! What an essential, and binding Obligation does this lay upon
al, that are, or will be friends of Christ, to stand always poring, and gazing
on this Glass; that so their hearts may be transformed into the same Image,
from Glory to Glory, as 2 Cor. 3.18? Who would not elect such a Divine, and
glorious Miroir for it self, to be always contemplating, loving, and enjoying
those soul-satisfying Perfections of the Deity, which center, and shine
therein, with such a Glory?

3. Farther, The Friends of Christ in Imitation of the Human Nature in Christ,
should get as near him, and love him as purely for himself as possibly it may
be.
the way and manner of the Human Nature's being glorified; namely, by its being
assumed, and personally united to the Godhead, does both demonstrate, and
instruct the friends of Christ, how they must elect, and love him for himself?
For, whereas God communicates his Goodness to other Creatures by created
Emanations, and effluences thereof; God the Son communicates his Goodness to his
Human Nature, not by a created emanation, or effluxe of Goodness from himself,
but by an Assumtion, and personal union of the Human Nature with himself. So
that the Human Nature in Christ is glorified, not by any emission, or
communication of goodness from Christ, but by a reception into, or hypostatick
union with himself. Now albeit the friends of Christ may not expect, or presume
to be Christed, or taken into an hypostatick personal union with Christ; no,
that is no less than blasphemy to affect, or desire; yet they should, and
ought, in imitation of their human Nature assumed by Christ, both to desire,
and endeavor as intimate an union, as possibly they may, with Christ their
friend; and farther elect, and love him as purely, and entirely for himself, as
they can. For the less the friends of Christ, eye, and regard the good things
that flow from him, though spiritual; and the more purely, and entirely they
intend, elect, and enjoy Christ for himself, and those glorious excellences
they see in him, the nearer they arrive unto, and the more they partake of that
beatifick Glory, which their human Nature, assumed into a personal union with
Christ, is invested with: I say, as the Human Nature in Christ hypostatically,
or personally united to the Deity, is wholly swallowed up with, and satisfied
in the Vision, and Fruition of Christ for himself; so in like manner the
friends of Christ should aspire (in Imitation of their human Nature, espoused
by, and taken into personal union with Christ) though not to have a personal
union with Christ, yet to come as near as they may, without diminution of
Christ's Glory, to the blessed vision, election, and Fruition of Christ for
himself.

4. Hence also it naturally follows, Christ's friends should present themselves
fit Temples, etc. for Christ.
that the friends of Christ ought, in Imitation of their human Nature espoused
by Christ, by all means possible, to present themselves fit Temples, Characters,
Faces, Images, and Miroirs or looking-Glasses of Christ, that so they may be
made partakers of his Glory, and enjoy him more fully for himself. Is Christ's
human Nature full of Grace? Does the plenitude of the Deity dwell therein
bodily, or personally, as in a Temple? Oh then! how much does it concern the
friends of Christ, to get their human Natures sanctified, to the utmost they
may, that so they may present themselves living, and holy Temples, fit for
Christ to dwell in, by his Spirit? This was that which Paul exhorts to, every
where, 1 Cor. 3.16, 17.
as 1 Cor. 3.16. know ye not that ye are the Temple of God, and that the Spirit
of God dwells in you. What does he conclude hence? v. 17. If any defile the
Temple of God, him shall God destroy: for the Temple of God is holy; which
Temple ye are. As if he had said: Do you consider, friends, what you do, in
defiling your human Nature? Is it not the Temple of God? and is it lawful to
defile the Temple of God? ought not the Temple of God to be holy? Will not God
destroy such as defile his Temple, his Holy place? O beware what you do:
remember your human Nature is the Temple of God. The like 1 Cor. 6.18. Flee
Fornication, etc. and he gives the reason of it, v. 19. What? 1 Cor. 6.18.
know ye not, that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost, 2 Cor. 6.16.
etc. so 2 Cor. 6.16. and what agreement has the Temple of God with Idols? For
ye are the Temple of the living God, etc. What, suffer Idol-lovers, and lusts
to loge in your hearts, which are the Temple of God? Oh! What monstrous
Sacrilege? What notorious blasphemy is this? There is no one consideration
does more deeply engage the friends of Christ, to press after Holiness, than
this, that, as their human Nature was so far honored by Christ, as to be taken
into a personal union with the Deity; so they, in their mesure, are taken into
a mystic union with Christ; and thence become Temples, wherein he dwells
graciously, and spiritually, though not bodily, or personally, as in his own
human Nature. Oh! what a cogent Argument should this be, to the friends of
Christ, to study, and endeavor, how they may beautify and adorn their human
Nature, that so it may be a fit Temple for Christ to dwell in, as the Human
Nature assumed by Christ, is the Temple wherein the Fulness of the Deity dwells
bodily? the very thought, how far human Nature is raised, and dignified in
Christ, how far should it raise our thoughts, studies, and important endeavors
after Holiness; that so our own human Natures may be presented to Christ, as
holy, and living Temples, fit for his gracious inhabitation? Ah! what a sad
contemplation is it to consider, how much many seeming friends of Christ abuse,
and abase human Nature, which is raised to so great a dignity, by suffering
vile Idol-lovers, and base lusts to inhabit therein? Could the blind Heathens
see so much cause, why men should not abase, but honor human Nature, because
the soul dwells in it? Oh then! how much greater cause have the friends of
Christ, to honor, and adorn human Nature with Grace, because Christ their best
friend dwells therein?

CHAP. VIII. This Doctrine of Amity with Christ improved by Doctrinal
Corollaries; and practick Uses, for the conviction of open Enemies, and
Hypocritick Friends of Christ.
SECT. 1. Doctrinal Corollaries from this first part of friendship with Christ.
HAving explicated, Doctrinal Corollaries from this first part of Friendship
with Christ.
and demonstrated the general constitution of the object; how and why the
friends of Christ must elect him singly, completely, and for himself: We now
come to make some general Improvements, both Doctrinal, and practick, of this
first part, of the first great and Fundamental Law of Friendship with Christ.
The Doctrinal Improvements of this Head, we shall reduce to certain useful
Corollaries, or Inferences; which naturally flow from what has been laid down,
and follow in their order.

1. 1. The Infinite condescension of Free Grace.
Does Christ assume sinners into such a blessed state of Friendship with
himself? Hence then we may infer, what the infinite condescension, and Soverain
Dominion of Free Grace, toward lapsed undone man is. What? Is it possible,
that the great Jehovah should stoop so low, as to engage in such an intimate
friendship with his poor creature? Yea, that the most glorious, pure, and
spotless Being, should be content to mingle with impure, dirtie, sinful flesh
and blood? Yea, farther, that the ever-blessed God should court, and beseech
his deformed creature, to enter into a strict bond of friendship with himself?
what transcendent condescendence is this? Was it ever known, that Beauty
courted Deformity; that Riches begged friendship of Poverty; that Honor
bended the knee to Reproach, and Disgrace; that the King beseeched the
Malefactor to be reconciled to him; that Happiness wooed Misery to be its
Spouse? Yet, Lo! thus it is in this business of Friendship with Christ: the
first, and supreme Beauty courts the most deformed sinner; the infinitely
rich, and self-sufficient Being begs his poor nothing-creature to be friends
with him; the most Honorable Lord of Glory wooeth his wretched, reproched, and
captive rebel to be, not only reconciled to him, but his Spouse. O the
unparalleled, and admirable soveraintie of this Divine, condescendent Grace!
Who would ever have thought, or imagined, that such All-sufficient, and
omnipotent Grace, should have stooped so low, to proud self-conceited, and
rebellious sinners? What a wonder of wonders is this, that free grace should
pursue sinners with continued offers, yea, importunate desires of Friendship,
when they pursue it with repeted Effronts, and Acts of Rebellion? O! how should
the friends of Christ admire, and adore the Lengths, Breadths, Depths, and
Heights of this Transcendent condescension of God?

2. 2. The Dignity of Religion.
Hence also we may infer, What a Noble, Generous, and Heroic thing the true
Christian Religion is; in that it puts lapsed man, into a state of friendship
with the great God. For, what is true Religion, but a Religation, or binding of
the soul unto God? And how can the soul be bound to God more inviolably, and
more intimately, than by deep, spiritual, and lively Acts of Contemplation,
Election, and Fruition of him for himself, as our friend? Must not therefore
that Religion needs be a very Heroic, and Generous thing, which binds the
heart to God, by such an inseparable, intimate, and strict bond of Friendship?
surely he deserves not this Title of honor, to be called a Christian, who
estimes not Religion, and Friendship with Christ as the most Honorable thing in
the World.

3. 3. It Is the highest Wisdom to make Christ our friend.
Hence learn farther, That none are truly Wise, Judicious, and Intelligent,
but such as elect Christ for their Friend. The choice of an agreeable, and good
friend, has always been accounted, by the wisest of men, of greatest moment,
and concernement. For Friendship, although it be but a Relative Being, yet it
is mighty efficacious, and Influential; in that it secretly insinuates, and
winds it self into the heart; and, by, I know not what kind of charm,
captivates, and transformes it into the Ideas, and Qualities of its friend. Is
it not then a point of highest Interest, and consequence, to see that we make
choice of the best friend? And can there be a more suitable, or better Friend
than Christ? Are not al other friends of no value, if compared with Christ?
Have not the best of creature-friends their cross humors, their
self-interests, their morose, and disagreable actions? But oh! what a
sweet-humored, self-denying, condescendent, affectionate, judicious, and
faithful friend is Christ? Surely then, they are no fools, who elect him for
their friend, albeit they thereby should disoblige all the world besides, and
incur its frowns. The friends of Christ know full well what they get, in making
Christ their friend, although thereby they lose al other friends; yea make them
their enemies. Time will be, and that not long hence, when it will more fully
appear, that there is nothing of moment, but real Friendship with Christ: and
therefore certainly they who elect Christ for their friend, must needs be the
wisest of men, yea the only wise men; albeit they are not such now in the
world's eye and estime.

4. 4. Al by nature enemies to God in Christ.
This Idea of Amity with Christ, as before stated, instructs us also, that al
men by nature are enemies to God in Christ. Friendship among men, as we have
proved, comes not from Nature, but by choice: Men are not borne, but made
friends; and that by long conversation, and experience, grounded on some commun
Likeness, and Agreablenes. And is there so much requisite to the constitution of
friendship among men? Oh! how much more then is there required, to the
constitution of a firm, inviolable, and spiritual Amity with Christ? Can a
blind mind, by Natures dark Lantern, see Christ's excellences? Can Free Will,
by her most potent Impotence, find legs to come to Christ, or arms to embrace
him? Can there be any Divine Amity with Christ, without some Divine
Conformity, and Similitude, to him? And has the black, deformed, Rebellious,
and dead soul any, the least, ressemblance of Christ by Nature? Does not
Friendship with Christ, in its formal Idea, import a complete Resignation, and
subjection to his Soverain Will, and Grace? And is not the Will of man naturally
crooked, perverse, stubborn, humorous, proud, inflexible, and every way
repugnant to Christ's will? Yea, do not men naturally hate Christ, and all that
belongs to him; his Yoke, Cross, Worship, Word, Ways and People? It Is true,
some natural men, having had the privilege of a good education, or the Infusion
of some commun graces, presume they love Christ well: but had they been borne of
Jews, or Pagans, would not the same commun motives, which now induce them to
love Christ, have proved as powerful to work in them, a more inveterate hatred
against him? Does not our Lord himself assure us? Luke 11.23. He that is not
with me, is against me, etc. Whereby he strongly proves, that there can be no
middle state betwixt Enmity against, and Friendship with Christ: such as are
not friends to, are enemies against him.

5. 5. Al Friendship with Christ from God.
Hence it follows, that God alone can make men friends of Christ: Divine Amity
is the effect of omnipotence: man may as soon give himself an Angelick Being,
as make himself a friend of Christ. Thence says Christ, Joh. 15.16. Ye have
not chosen me, but I have chosen you, etc. Joh. 15.16. Commendat (...), ^^um,
q-od a se ani^^^^ae sactur sit init^um, ^ullis ^ so um i^ s^ ben factis
provocu^o Non me ^le^istis i^ amicum, sed ego Vos. Grot. in ^oc.
i. e. mine Election of you, precedes your election of me: you could never have
elected me, had I not first pre-elected, and pre-determined your hearts in
order thereto. Can corrupt Nature abjure, and abandon it self, its own Wisdom,
Will, Interest, and Dependences? Would it not be thought a prodigious thing, if
a dead man should take up his Grave on his back, and walk? And does not the
Scripture conclude al men by nature to be spiritually dead? Is there not an
Infinite distance between something and Nothing? And can any but Infinite, and
Omnipotent power reconcile extremes so infinitely distant, as something and
Nothing? How then can this Something of Friendship with Christ, be educed out
of the confused Nothing of corrupt Nature, but by the omnipotent, creative
power of God, who calls (or makes) things that are not as though they were,
Romans 4.17. Romans 9.25.

6. 6. The contradictions of many seeming friends of Christ.
Must Christ be thus elected by his friends? then hence conclude, what
monstrous contradictions many seeming friends of Christ lie under. Who is there
so profligate, and debauched, but would fain be accounted a friend of Christ?
And yet how few are there, who walk with Christ, according to those Laws of
friendship, which he has made essential to such a state? Is it not a flat
contradiction in Christianity, for men to profess Amity with Christ, and yet
still to reserve secret haunts for some beloved lust? What! a friend to Christ,
and yet maintain secret dalliances, and correspondences with his worst enemies,
Self-love, Pride, Carnalitie, or any other Delilah? A friend to Christ, and yet
a friend to the unrighteous Mammon; as avaritious, as greedy of world goods, as
any Worldling? A friend to Christ, and yet as selfish, as narrow-hearted, as
much clung to the Interests of the flesh, as those who are Christ's professed
enemies? A friend of Christ, and yet a secret, if not open, enemy to the
Saints his friends, to his Yoke, Cross, Scepter, or Government, and ways? A
friend of Christ, and yet as conformable to the lusts, humors, mades or
fashions of this World, as carnal Sensualists? A friend of Christ, and yet as
frothie, as vain, as sleight-spirited, as wanton in discourse, as the profane?
A friend of Christ, and yet as passionate and furious, on the least
provocation; as fraudulent and deceitful in thy dealings; as unfaithful and
remiss in the Relations, and duties of thy family; as profane in thine
observation of the Lord's day; as formal, careless, and inconstant in thy
private Devotion; as regardlesse, or indifferent as to the public worship and
ordinances of God, as others, who pretend little or nothing to friendship with
Christ? Oh! What infinite contradictions are these? How is Hell crowded with
such friends of Christ? Fie, Fie upon such Friendship! Either resolve to quit
the Name of a friend to Christ, or else cloth thy name, with somewhat that is
better than a mere name, and more really demonstrative of the thing thou layest
claim unto.

7. How far some may go as to seeming Friendship with Christ, and yet be but
real Enemies to him.
This farther informs us, That many awakened, terrified, illuminated, gified,
and formal Professors may arrive to high elevations, and raisures of commun
Friendship with Christ, and yet be indeed no real friends, but enemies to him.
Thus it was with him, Mark 12.34. Mark. 12.31.
And when Jesus saw that he answered discretely, he said unto him; Thou are not
far from the Kingdom of God. He was very near to Divine Amity with Christ, in
regard of his Gifts, Illumination, Commun Affection, and Morality: and yet
very far off from any cordial, entire, and thoroughout embracement of a single,
complete Christ, for himself. It is, or at least ought to be a dreadful
consideration for the Professors of this Generation, to consider, how near the
Kingdom of Heaven, many seeming friends of Christ have come in this Age; what
strong and clear convictions of sin they have had; what tremblements, and
Earthquakes of Conscience they have lain under; how much, and how long they
have been wounded by a Spirit of Bondage; how far their hearts have been purged
from many gross, yea some more refined corruptions; What a stock of Evangelick
Gifts, and commun Graces they have attained unto; what affectionate desires
they have seemed to have toward Christ, his Ordinances, Discipline, Ministers,
Truths, Worship, Members, and ways; how far they have tasted of the Celestial
Gift, and the powers of the World to come, Heb. 6.4, 5. What solemn covenants
they have made with Christ; and lastly, how far they have walked with Christ,
(though with a crooked double heart) in seeming ways of friendship; I say, to
consider how near the Kingdom of Heaven, many such pretended friends of Christ
have come, in these latter days, and yet after al, approved themselves open
enemies to him. Oh! what a terrible, what a soul-confounding, what an
heart-bleeding consideration is, or ought this to be, to the professed friends of
Christ this day? What heart is there, if not Adamantine and obdurate, but
trembles at such thoughts? How should these sad, yea prodigious spectacles of
Apostasy, fill us al with a Godly fear, holy awe, and self-jelousie? Let him
that stands, take heed lest he fall.

8. 8. How easy a thing it is to miscarrie in the beginning of our friendship
with Christ.
Hence also we are taught, how easy a thing it is to miscarrie in the
Beginnings of a professed friendship with Christ. Is there so much required to
the constitution of a real Amity with Christ? Must there be a parting with all
Beloved Idols? Is it necessary that we bid Adicu to al Old Lovers, whether
Sin, Self, the World, or Law? Is this the first fundamental Law of friendship
with Christ, that we espouse a single, complete, Christ, for himself, and with
a single complete heart? Oh! how easy a thing is it then to miscarrie, in the
beginnings of our friendship with Christ? Believe it, the least flaw or error,
in our first closings with Christ, is fundamental. Whence procedes the great
Hypocrisies, and Apostasies of men's Hearts, and Lives, but from some practick
error, mistake, or defect in their first Election of, and Amity with Christ?
Friendship il begun, can never end well: He that begins but an Almost friend,
will end an Altogether-enemie of Christ.

9. 9. Much seeming friendship with Christ is but real enmity to him.
This instructs us also, That much of that which passes for good friendship
with Christ, in the eye of the World, is in truth but real enmity against
Christ, in the eye of God. Oh! how many are there, who are friends of Christ in
profession, and yet enemies to him in Affection; at lest in the Bent of their
Hearts? Ah! Alas! how is the visible Church on earth, crowded with many secret
enemies to, who seem good friends of Christ? Yea, what Throngs, and Crowds of
Hypocrites are there now roaring in Hell, who once passed for great friends of
Christ, in the visible Church? Assuredly, real Friendship with Christ is very
rare, and difficult: It is an easy matter to be a friend in Name; but O! how
difficult is it to be so indeed? I verily believe, that one great design of al
God's Providence toward his Church, is to discover the Rottennesses, and
Hypocrisy of false friends of Christ. And I am not without great, and, I fear,
too rational fears, that many of those who now pass for generally avowed
friends of Christ, will one day appear to be but hollow-hearted, and masqued
enemies of him. O that there were not too great grounds for such fears!

10. 10. True friendship among men very rare.
From the general Idea, and notion of Friendship, we may collect, That there is
little, yea very little real, and solid Amity to be found amongst men, each
toward other. It Is true, there is nothing among men more affected, and commun
than this style, Your Friend; and yet what more rare than the Thing? The Notion
of Friendship is Sweet, and Amiable; and therefore al lay claim to it; but the
practice of the Thing it self is very difficult and rare, especially in this
self-seeking Age; and therefore it is no wonder, that the most of men, even
among those who assume to themselves the name, are so much strangers to the
thing. Alas! How few are there, who do, or can elect their friend for himself?
Will not the most of men break with their best friends, when they cross their
Humors, or Interests? Do not the Philosophers teach us, that al true Amity is
founded in Virtue? And is there any virtue beyond Friendship with Christ? May
we not then hence conclude, That there is no true Amity among men, as men, but
what springs from Amity with Christ? I am strongly persuaded, that there was
never less Friendship among men, as men, than now adays: and the reasons to
me are evident; namely, from the strength of men's private passions, their
Inordinate love to this World, the Soverain prevalence of self, and the decay
of that ancient Simplicity, Integrity, and publick-spiritednes, which
formerly flourished among men. These, I say, seem to be the genuine Reasons,
and Causes, why there now is less natural, or civil Amity among men, than in
the days of old.

11. 11. The folly of such as refuse to make Christ their friend.
Hence also we may conclude, That such as refuse to elect Christ for their
friend, are deservedly branded with the blackest marque of Fools, and Mad men.
Is Christ indeed so amiable, and eligible for himself? Does all the Glory, and
perfection of the blessed Deity dwell bodily in him? Is it man's supreme
Dignity, Liberty, and perfection to elect, and adhere to him for himself? Oh
then! how desperately foolish, how notoriously mad are al they, who reject, or
neglect the election of such a friend? Alas! what is it to have all the World
thy friend, if Christ be thine enemy? Will not all the Glory of this fading
world, at the last conflagration, be burnt up, and contracted into its first
nothing; at least as to matter of happiness? What can thou be said to have, or
enjoy, if thou want Christ? How poor would thy gain be, if all the earth were
thine, and Christ not thine? But on the contrary, what a blessed loss is
that, if thou should lose al things, to gain Christ? Are not al things
without Christ nothing, and nothing with Christ, as good as al things? Is it
not notorious folly, for a rational soul, to hunger after the jejune, emtie
pleasures of a vexatious World, and to neglect the Divine suavities, and
delices of an increated, eternal Good? Does it not argue a sottish, bewitched
mind, to stand gazing on a blasted, Sunburned flour of sensible good, and
meanwhile to turn the back on the Sun of Righteousness, that first Light, and
Beauty? Alas! Alas! that Rational creatures should be so raving mad, as to
lavish their Affections on such deformed Harlots, and black Idols of clay, and
yet find so little love, for the best friend that ever was! O the Monstrous
folly! O the unconceivable madness of blind sinners! That Beauty it self should
have so few eyes gazing on it; that the supreme, eternel, most comprehensive,
most diffusive, most permanent, and best good, should have so few hearts
fettered and chained to it! That he, who is the wonder of Heaven, and Earth,
the only Beloved of the Father, should have so little share in the hearts of
men! O bewitched fools! O blind souls! What ails you, that such an incomparable
friend is despised by you? How comes it to pass, that you are so desperately
mad, as to part with your love, and souls for mere nothing? When will men ^e
wise?

SECT. 2. A practick Improvement of this Doctrine, touching Amity with Christ,
in order to the conviction of secure sinners, who reject Christ.
Of conviction to secure sinners, who mind not Friendship with Christ.
HAving dispatched the Doctrinal Corollaries, we now proceed to some practick
Improvements of this great Doctrine, touching Friendship with Christ. And the
first great practick Use I would make of this Doctrine, is of convincement to
secure sinners, who neither Mind, nor Affect this great concern of Divine
Amity with Christ. This Use I shall branch forth into two parts, (1.) The
conviction of the Sin. (2.) The conviction of the Misery, of such as neither
mind, nor Affect Friendship with Christ.

1. 1. The Aggravation of this Sin, not to mind friendship with Christ mesured.
To convince secure sinners of their sin; in rejecting, or neglecting
Friendship with Christ, we may consider its Aggravations both in regard of its
Object, Subject, Formal Nature, and Effects.

1. 1. By its Object.
The Aggravations, and weight of this sin will greatly appear, if we seriously
weigh, and consider the Object against which it strikes. For it is a Maxim
evident to the Light of Nature, and so universally granted by all considerate
persons, That the Aggravation of an offense is to be mesured by the Object, or
Person against whom it is committed. Now then let us consider what there is in
Christ, that Aggravates their sin, who refuse Divine Amity with him.

(1.) 1. It is against Christ the alone Author of life.
Is not Christ the alone Spring, and Source of Spiritual life? Can any but
Christ give life to dead souls? Did he not die, that dead sinners might live?
Is not his blood a Soverain balsame for wounded bleeding souls? O then! how
comes it to pass, that bleeding, dying sinners reject him, who is the alone
Soverain physician of Souls? Was it ever known, that a condemned Rebel refused
to be reconciled to, and receive a pardon from his Soverain Prince? Is it
possible, that a wretched Malefactor, hung up in Chains for his Sin, should
refuse friendship with the Prince of Life, who alone can save him? What? Art
thou a poor, starved sinner, and yet refusest the Bread of life? Yea do thou
trample on the Lord of life, who makes such provision of suitable, abundant,
soul-strengthening, soul-fattening, soul-satisfying, and delicious food for
thee? Oh! what a monstrous piece of Ingratitude is this? So Psalm. 81.10, 11.
Psalm. 81.10, 11.
Christ makes a solemn invitation: open thy mouth wide and I will fill it. And
what follows? But my people would not hearken to my voice: and Israel would
none of me. Oh! there lies the sting of their sin, Israel would have none of
me. This [Me] is the greatest word that ever was spoke: it lies as a Mountain
of Lead on Israel's sin: O! What a generous, illustrious, Divine Me is this?
How many Paradises, Heavens, and Glories lies wrapped up in this great Me? What a
death, and Hell is it to be deprived of this brave, and noble Me? What
eye-pleasing Beauties, what soul-satisfying delices, what infinite Treasures of
Grace, and Glory lie in this inconceivable Me, as dropped from Christ's mouth?
And yet, lo! Israel would have none of me: I would fain be a friend of Israel,
but alas! Israel would have none of me, for her friend: I court and woo Israel
to be my Spouse, but she refuses and rejects Me: Me, who am her most
honorable, laudable, and best self; Me, who am her old, tried, faithful,
omnipotent, most useful, and most pleasing friend. What a world of deep
aggravations are there couched under this little Pronoun Me? Who would ever
have imagined, that Israel, who professed so much friendship to Christ, should
be guilty of such unkindnes?

(2.) 2. Christ willingness to give forth life, and to be reconcilee to sinners.
Is not Christ extreme willing, and ready to give out life to sinners? Does he
not long for, and thirst after the Salvation of lost souls? Are not his offers
of life exceeding Free, cheerful, and universal? May not all that will, come and
drink freely of this living Fountain, Revel. 21.6? Is not he as ready to give
as we are to ask; to open, as we are to knock, Joh. 4.10. Does he not give
Liberally, and Abundantly to all that desire friendship with him, Cant. 5.1?
Yea, does he not wait long, and greatly importune sinners to be reconciled to
him? So 2 Cor. 5.20. We pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.
Now is not this an heinous crime, that Christ, who is the Lord of Glory,
should come and beseech his enemies to be reconciled to him, and yet they go on
in open Hostility against him? What? Does Christ, who is the person offended,
and injured, stoop so low, as to become a supplicant, and beseech you, who are
rebellious Subjects, to be reconciled to him, and his Father? And will you
slight such gracious condescension, such unparalleld offers of mercy? Oh!
What prodigious Impiety is this?

(3.) Christ's personal excellences.
Consider again, what it is you reject, in rejecting Christ and friendship with
him. Is not Christ, as has been proved, most eligible for himself? Does not al
God the Father's Glory, and perfection, even the Blessed Deity it self, dwell
corporally, i. e. Really, Substantially, and Personally in him? Is he not the
express Image and Character of the Father's Person, and Glory, Heb. 1.3? And
is he not thence the First in order of Truths, and the Last in order of Ends;
the Alpha and Omega of man's Felicity, as Revel. 1.11. I am Alpha and Omega,
the First, and the Last, etc? Now, can a rational creature be guilty of a
greater crime than this, to refuse Friendship with the first Truth, and Last
End of al things? For, what more Beautiful than the First Truth or Light? and
what more Amiable than the Last End or choicest Good? Does not heautie attract
the eyes, and Goodness allure the Hearts of al? And, by a paritie of reason,
must not the First Beauty, if duly apprehended, necessarily be most
attractive of the mind's contemplation; and the Last, best Good, most alluring
of the wil's Election? And yet, Ah! Alas! How few minds stand gazing on Christ,
the First Beauty, and Truth? How few Wills are fettered and chained to Christ,
the Last End, and Chiefest Good? Oh! What horrid Atheism, Sacrilege, and
Blasphemy is this, to refuse Amity with such an excellent superlative Good as
Christ is? Who would ever believe, did not woeful experience assure us of it,
that man, who is endued with a rational capacity, should be so much averse
from, yea an enemy to his best Good? Oh! when, when, will the blind, mad world
of sinners come to it self, and be convinced of its sin, and misery, in
rejecting Christ, the alone Fountain of the Divine Life, and the main of
objective Beatitude?

2. 2. The Aggravations of this sin, in refusing Amity with Christ, mesured by
its subject.
The Aggravations of this sin, in rejecting friendship with Christ, may be
mesured by its chief Subject or Seat, which is the Will. This is an Aphorism in
Theology, generally granted in the Schools, That look by how much the more of
the will there is in any sin, by so much the more it is aggravated: For the Will
is the chief seat, and therefore the mesure of Meral Beings, whether good or
evil. If there were no good will, there could be no Grace, nor Glory: and if
there were no sinful will, there could be no sin, nor Hell: And so by
consequence, according to the proportion of the will, Such is the proportion of
our Grace, or Sin. A will strongly bent for God, is eminently Gracious; and a
will strongly bent for sin, is notoriously wicked. Now this sin, of rejecting
Amity with Christ, carries much of the will, and therefore much of the the
formal Nature, Venom, and Malignitie of sin in it. And thence it deserves a
remarque, that when Christ comes to convince the unbelieving Jews, of the
weight of their sin in rejecting him, he lays the stresse of al on their Will.
Psalm. 81.11.
So Psalm. 81.11. But my people would not hearken to my voice, and Israel would
none of me. The like Prove. 1.25. But ye have set at naught al my counsel, and
would none of my reproof. Thus also Joh. 5.40. And ye will not come to me that
ye might have life. And so else where, Christ frequently upbraids them with
wilful impenitence, and unbelief: which argues not any sufficient light in
Nature to apprehend, or moral capicitie in the Will to embrace Christ, but
these, and such like Reprehensions are used to point out the chief root, and
seat of the disease, which is the Will: For sinners are wilfully Ignorant, or
Haters of the light, as Prove. 1.29. For that they hated knowledge, etc. and so
proportionably, wilfully impotent, or unable to come to Christ for life. Now is
it not a prodigious sin, for men wilfully to shut their eyes against, and hate
the most beautiful, and glorious rays of Divine light, that stream from
Christ, the Sun of Righteousness? Is Christ so full of life, and so willing to
give it forth unto all that come unto him? and shall sinners be unwilling to
receive it? What? not willing to live? Does not this seem strange? A reasonable
creature, and yet unwilling to be happy? Is death a thing so amiable, as to be
preferred before life; yea, Immortal death, before Immortal life? Was it ever
known, that chains and fetters were more eligible, than Liberty and freedom?
Oh! what a monstrous sin is this, that poor undone sinners, should wilfully
contemn the Fountain of al life? Who would ever have thought, that a rational
creature should be so sottish and mad, as wilfully, and electively to prefer
sin, the worst evil, before Christ the chiefest good? What a reproach, and
disgrace is this to human Nature, that it should cordially embrace Satan, the
worst of enemies, and wilfully reject Christ the best of Friends? Can there be
a greater sin than this, for an Intelligent Being electively to choose, yea,
love Death, and hate Christ, who is life it self? And yet this is the case of
al those who embrace not Christ as their friend, Prove. 8.36. Al they that hate
me, love death.

3. 3. The mesure of this sin from its formal Nature.
The Aggravations of this sin, not to mind, or affect Amity with Christ, are
lively represented in its Formal Nature, and Idea. The Definition, or essential
Idea of a thing gives you its formal nature, portrait, and Image: and if you
understand the Formal nature of a sin, you may easily guess at its
Aggravations. Now the general Idea, and formal nature of al sin consists in an
Obliquitie, or transgression of some Divine Law. And by how much the more
forcible, obligatorie, and inviolable the Law is, by so much the more there is
of Obliquitie, and Malignitie in that sin, which is the Transgression of such a
Law. Now the Law, which obliges men to mind and affect Amity with Christ, is
the Mediators Law, an Evangelick Law, which has a double Sanction appendent to
it; not only that of a Creator, but also that of a Redeemer. And oh! What an
heinous crime is this, to Transgress this Evangelick Law of the Mediator;
which is twisted, and composed of such silken cords of love, such sweet
obligations of Evangelick Grace, and Mercy? This Aggravation is set forth to
the life, Heb. 2.2, 3. For if the word spoken by Angels. [i. e. the Law of
Moses] was steadfast, and every Transgession, and disobedience received a just
recompense of reward: How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation,
which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, etc? As if he had said:
Alas! if the Transgression of the Mosaic Law was reputed so heinous, and
therefore had such dreadful curses pronounced against it; what shall we say of
such as transgress the Mediator's Evangelick Law of Grace; which offers life
and salvation to sinners? Oh! what a prodigious sin is this, to neglect so
great Salvation, which the Son of God invites us to? How deservedly do such
perish? But a little to examine the particular Ideas, The particular Ideas of
this sin.
and branches of this sin.

(1.) 1. It Is full of Atheism and unbelief.
Not to mind, and affect Amity with Christ, carries in its formal nature or
bowels a world of Unbelief, and Atheism. Not to embrace Christ as our best
friend, what is it but to give God the Lie? So 1 John 5.10. 1 John 5.10.
He that believes not God, has made him a liar; because he believes not the
record that God gave of his Son. Can there be a greater sin than this, to make
God, who is veracitie it self, and the first Truth, a Liar? And does not every
one that rejects Christ, make God a liar; because he believes not the record
that God has given of his Son? O remember, sinner, what thou do, when thou
refusest friendship with Christ: know, that thereby thou make the most
faithful, and blessed God a liar; And so, (O the monstrous Blasphemy not to be
mentioned without horror!) a Son of the Devil?

(2.) 2. It is a crucifixion of Christ.
To reject Christ, or neglect friendship with him, is no less than a repeted
Crucifixion of Christ, and exposing of him to open shame: Men cry Shame, and
Treachery on Judas, for betraying of his Lord: They condemn Pilate, for
condemning the Lord of life: Who so wicked, as not to estime the Jews bloody,
and cursed, for embrewing their hands in the blood of their Messiah? But know
that every one, who refuses Christ, and friendship with him, betrays him as
much as Judas, condemns him worse than Pilate, and embrews his hands in his
Savior's blood, as well as the bloud-thirstie Jews. For it is most certain, that
Christ has no worse Enemy, than the Unbeliever; he who will not e^^ct him as
his friend. He that will not embrace Christ, as offered in the Gospel, with his
whole heart, and adhere to him as his best friend, is his worst enemy; and one
that daily crucifies the Lord of Glory, by his unbelief. O consider the weight
of this sin, as described, Heb. 6.6. Seeing they Crucify to themselves the Son
of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.

(3.) 3. It is a blaspheming Christ.
Not to embrace Christ, as offered in the Gospel for our friend, is formal
blasphemy; in that it brings a scandal, il report, and reproach on Christ.
What is Blasphemy, but to raise an il report, or scandal on God, whereby the
most blessed Deity is reproched. Now, what brings a greater reproach or
Scandal on God, than to contemn and disgrace the Son of God, so far, as to
prefer any other friend, either sin, or self before him? Can there be a greater
reproach or disgrace cast on Christ, than to elect Id^l-lusts, or other lovers
before him? Is not this an high piece of Blasphemy, to tell the World, that
that the Creature deserves our friendship more than Christ the Creator of al?
Oh think on this!

(4.) 4. It is Sa^r^^^ge.
Not to make Christ our friend, is, in an high degree Sacrilege, or robbing God
of his due. Al serious spirits hate and abhor the Imputation of Sacrilege, both
name and thing: But what greater Sacrilege can there be, than to rob, and
plunder Christ of his Diadem, and Imperial Throne? Is not Christ's Mediatorie
Office his Diadem? and is not the heart of his friends, his chief Imperial
Throne? Do not then al such as refuse to make him their friend, rob him of his
Diadem and Throne? Thus we see what the Aggravations of this sin are in regard
of its formal nature and Idea.

4. 4. The Aggravations of this sin not to Elect Christ from its Effects.
We may take a mesure of this sin, not not to mind friendship with Christ, by
its Effects. That must needs be a sin of the first magnitude, which has a most
Universal, malignant Influence on al other Sin. Now enmity against Christ, or
the neglect of friendship with him, is the bitter root, and poisoned Fountain
of al other sin. Whence springs carnal confidence, groundles presumtion,
soul-delusion, Formalitie, Hypocrisy, Hardness of heart, and final Apostasy,
but from enmity against Christ, or some essential defect of Amity with him?

2. 2. The misery of such as regard not friendship with Christ.
We have explicated the Aggravations of the sin; we might be as large in laying
open the Aggravations of the misery, that follows on the not minding, and
Affecting Amity with Christ. Can there be an higher piece of Misery, than to
have Christ, who is the best friend, our worst Enemy? And is not Christ a
professed enemy unto al such, as regard not friendship with him? Were it not
much better for a man to have all the World his enemy, than Christ? Can there
be a worse Hell, than an Heart void of Christ? We may read the dreadful doom of
such, Heb. 10.28, 29.
Heb. 10.28, 29. He that despised Moses's Law died without mercy, under two or
three witnesses. Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought
worthy, who has trodden under foot the Son of God, etc? As the sin of rejecting
Christ is of an higher and deeper guilt, so also the punishment bears some
proportion thereto. The Mediator's curse is a double, and complicated curse: A
cup of pure, immixed vengeance is prepared for Evangelick enemies of Christ:
The hottest place in Hell must be their eternal mansion and portion. So it
follows, v. 30. For we know him that has said, Vengeance belongs unto me, I
will recompense says the Lord. Evangelick Vengeance, is Vengeance with a
witness; perfect in the highest degree and kind, both Intensively, and
Extensively? And that which adds the greatest weight to al, is, that it is
Immediate Vengeance: it flows immediately from the vindictive justice of Christ
the Mediator, against whom the sin is committed. So, v. 31. It is a fearful
thing to fall into the hands of the living God. The like 2 These. 1.8. In flaming
fire taking vengeance, etc. v. 9. who shall be punished with everlasting
destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the gl^rie of his (...).
This (...) comes immediately from the (...) of the Lord, both as the Effective
Cause, and (...) as the objective Term^ thereof. Evangelic^ (...) of Christ may
now slight, and disregard both his offers of friendship, and Threats of
punishiment: but oh! what will they say, or think, or do, when they see him,
whole friendship they have now contemned, coming, as their Judge, in flaming
fire, to take vengeance on them? O that they would now consider, What it is to
fall under the Mediator's malediction! Let all the ^nemies of Christ, whether
open or secret, remember, that their condemnation stands subscribed, and sealed
with the Mediator's curse, unless they repent, and come to terms of
friendship with him, Joh. 3.18. He that believes not, is condemned already,
i. e. His sentence of eternal damnation stands subscribed, and sealed in
Heaven, and the execution will unavoidably follow, unless he repent. And tell me
now, is death a thing so desirable, as to be preferred before life? Are the
chains, and fetters of damned sinners so amiable, as to make thee in love with
them? Can thou expect more ease and satisfaction in the eternal flames of
divine wrath, than in the sweet bosom of the Lord Jesus? Will the hideous
yellings, and dismal cries of damned spirits, be more pleasing Music in thine
ears, than the blessed Halelujah's of glorified Saints and Angels? Is there so
much sweetness, and Liberty in the service of Satan or sin, as to make thee
willing to prefer it before Amity with Christ, and the glorious Liberty of
the sons of God? Are the poisonous streams, which flow from the dead Sea of
sensual enjoyment, more refreshing, and soul- satisfying, than the waters of
life from Christ? If not, how comes it to pass that thou do so much
neglect, and slight Amity with Christ? Lo! Christ is willing to be friends
with thee; he offers life to thee; take heed what thou do; neglect not so
great salvation: Remember what it is that is offered to thee; and who it is
that offers it. And O! beware how thou delayest in coming to terms of
Agreement with Christ. Have thou not long enough already persisted in enmity
against Christ, and thine own soul? Will thou be so hard-hearted, and so cruel
to thy self, as to embrew thine hands, for ever, in thine own blood; the blood
of thine Immortal soul? Is not enmity against Christ the worst soul-murder?
Can thou find it in thine heart to let thy poor soul famish, when as the
bread of life is offered to thee? Art thou content to hang in chains for ever,
as a rebel against Heaven, rather than to accept a pardon from so gracious a
Prince? O have some pity on thy soul, and resolve to make Christ thy friend.
Alas! Alas! can thou expect that any should pity thee at the last day, if
now thou will not have some pity on thy self? Art thou resolved to be a Devil
to thy self, I mean a Destroyer of thine own soul, by thy wilful enmity
against Christ? What shall I say? O that I could but persuade men to be willing
to live! Is this a difficult request? and yet, Alas! how few are there, who are
really willing to live eternally? It is a dismal, astonishing consideration, to
think, how few, among the crowd of Christians, are really willing to live.
Surely, did secure sinners understand what true spiritual life, and Happiness
were, we should not have so much ado, to beseech them to close with Christ, as
their friend. Oh! this is the curse of curses, men know not the things that
belong to their peace, Luke 19.42.

SECT. 3. How far Refined Hypocrites may proceed, in a seeming Amity with
Christ, and yet continue real enemies to him.
Use 2. For conviction and terror to refined Hypocrites.
THis Doctrine of Divine Amity with Christ, as before stated, affords us yet a
more close word of conviction, and Terror for secret refined Hypocrites; who
seem good friends, but yet really are no better than masqued enemies of Christ.
Indeed the case of such is more desperate, than that of open enemies to Christ:
For, by how much the more difficult it is, to discover the wound of their
Hypocrisy, by so much the more dangerous, and incurable it is. According to
moral estimation, it is far more easy to awaken a debauched sinner, and make
him sensible of his necessity of Christ, than Evangelick, Spiritual, and
refined Hypocrites; who being under some commun Illuminations, transient
Affections, seeming Graces, Good motions, and false pretensions of Friendship
with Christ, are hereby made more Real and Effectual, though cunning, and
imperceptible enemies to him. Wherefore to disabuse, and undeceive such
self-deluding sinners, of their dangerous, if not desperate Hypocrisy, we
shall, with the Lord's Assistance, endeavor to lay open before them, (1.) How
Far they may proceed in a seeming Friendship with Christ, and yet continue real
enemies to him. And then, (2.) What a sinful, foolish, cursed, and wretched
state this is, under a pretended Friendship with Christ, to cover over, and
concele a real enmity against him.

Q. 1. How far Refined, Evangelick Hypocrites may proceed in a seeming
friendship with Christ, and yet continue real enemies to him. The very mention
of this Question should make our flesh to Tremble; especially if we consider,
what prodigious experiments, and Instances we have had in this Age (to ascend
no higher) to explicate, and demonstrate the same. O that we al had a deep,
quick, lively, and feeling sense of the weight of this Question. How far many
seeming friends of Christ may go, and yet be but real enemies to him.
How should the Apprehensions, of the Apostasies of these latter times,
possess our Consciences with a Divine awe, self-jelousie, and Tremblement?
That must needs be a very hard heart, that is not affected, and afflicted,
under the sense of the great Backslidings, which many pretended friends of
Christ lie under. How many violent, forced friends has Christ; who crouch and
bend the Knee to him, under the Storms and heats of divine wrath, but turn
their back again upon him, when the storm is over? How many accidental,
occasional friends has Christ, who falls in love with him, so long as he falls
in with their carnal, or legal Interest? But when Providence seems to cross
Promises, or the Interest of Christ really crosses their private Interest, how
soon do such bid Adieu and farewell to Christ? Therefore to undeceive the
deceived Professors of this backsliding Age, take these following Propositions,
as a brief Resolution of the Question before us.

1. Prop. 1. As to the Spirit of Bondage.
A seeming friend of Christ may proceed very far, in all the great preparative
Convictions, and Dispositions of the Spirit of Bondage. Are the sincere Friends
of Christ deeply convinced of, burdened with, and wounded for sin? And may not
the false friends of Christ, very far share in these preparative works of the
Spirit of Bondage? Was not Cain greatly convinced of, and burdened with his
sin, when he cried out, my punishment is greater than I can bear, Genesis 4.14?
Did not Judas also the feel the weight of his sin, which made him strangle
himself? Had not debauched Felix a mighty terror and Tremblement on his
Conscience, when Paul the Prisoner struck him in the right vein, and made him
sensible of his Intemperance, Injustice, and Judgment to come, Act. 24.25?
Yea, have not many awakened, convinced consciences, at times, been under great
soul-confounding Terrors, and perhaps greater than many sincere friends of
Christ ever felt; and yet after al, grown more secure than ever; yea, open
enemies to Christ? Oh! how should this make our hearts to ache and tremble?

2 Prop. 2. As to Aversion from sin and self.
A false friend of Christ may arrive to a very great mesure of partial Aversion
from sin, and self; which are Christ's worst enemies. Had not Balaam a great
Indignation, at least seemingly, against the wages of unrighteousnes, offered
to him by Balak? Yea, does he not make a solemn vow against it? Numb. 6.22,
18. If Balak would give me his house full of gold, etc. Had he not also many
conflicts, in his own spirit, against this sin? May not many false friends of
Christ have, not only some grosser and externe branches of sin lopped off, but
also some interne lusts quenched for a while; Yea, the whole mass of sin laid
asleep, and seemingly mortified for the present; especially under violent heats
of Conscience? Does not this seem to be the import of that Text, Luk 11.25.
Luke 11.25. and when he comes he finds it swept and garnished? And so in
like manner for self-denial; how far have many false friends of Christ
proceeded, not only in the renunciation of carnal, and sensual self; but also of
inward, spiritual, moral, legal, yea, evangelick self; and yet still continued
real enemies of Christ, as before, Chap. 2. Sect. 2?

3 Prop. 3. As to Assent and Estime of Christ.
A false friend of Christ may arrive unto a great Assent unto, and commun
Estime of Christ, as a very desirable Friend. Had not those false friends of
Christ, a very strong assent to, and estime of Christ as their Messiah, when
they cried out, Joh. 6.14.
John 6.14. This is of a Truth, That Prophet that should come into the world?
Yea, their Assent and conviction was so prevalent, as that they would needs
make him their King, v. 15. And yet the very same persons, not long after,
turn professed enemies to him. Yea, were there not some of the awakened Jews
so far taken with Christ, as that they would presently, without any more delay,
give him a solemn Inauguration and Enstalment, as their Messiah? So Joh.
12.13. Joh. 12.13.
Took branches of Palm Trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna,
blessed is the King of Israel, that comes in the name of the Lord. The
branches of Palm Trees, were tokens of their Joy; and their crying Hosanna, was
a Rite, whereby they recognized him as their Messiah: And yet Lo! the very same
persons, as it is most likely, within a very few days cry, Crucify, Crucify
him.

4 Prop. 4. As to consent and closing with Christ.
A false friend of Christ may attain unto a considerable consent to, and
closing with Christ as his friend. Did not many of the Rulers believe on
Christ, who yet durst not openly confess him, as their friend, Joh. 12.42?
Joh. 12.42. Mat. 8.19.
Yea, does not the awakened, ingenuous Scribe, Mat. 8.19. make a solemn
contract, or covenant of Friendship with Christ, saying: Master I will follow
thee wheresoever thou go? And yet Christ seems, by what follows, to put no
confidence in him. Yea, may not the false friends of Christ very far close with
him, as the Objective matter of their Happiness, and yet come short of real
friendship? Does not this seem to be the case of many awakened Jews? Joh. 6.34.
So Joh. 6.34. Lord evermore give us this bread. And yet when Christ explicates
more fully how they must feed on this bread of life, how much are they
scandalized at him, v. 60, 61?

5 Prop. 5. As to Affections.
A false friend of Christ may have some superficial transient Affections for
Christ, and against what may appose him as his friend. Did not many false
friends gladly receive Christ? Luke 8.40. (...) i. e. benigno voltu, etc.
Luke 8.40. The people gladly received him, i. e. with a smiling, joyous
countenance, they bid him welcome. Did not Herod gladly hear John Baptist? Did
not Balaam desire to die the death of the Righteous? Did not Pharaoh, and Simon
Magus desire the Prayers of Christ's Ministers? Did not the Foolish Virgins
desire the Oil of Grace, to welcome Christ withal, Mat. 25.1? Was not Jehu
seemingly filled with zele for the Worship of Christ, against Baal's Priests
and Idols? Did not Saul, and Ahab mourn under the Displeasure and curse of
God? Oh! what serious spirit trembles not at this?

6 Prop. 6. As to Union with Christ.
A false friend of Christ may come unto some seeming union with Christ. Does
not Christ make mention of some dead branches, which yet have a seeming
implantation into, and union with him? Joh. 15.2.
Joh. 15.2. every branch in me that bears not fruit, etc. It Is true, they
have not a Physic, or Hyper-Physick, supernatural, and real union of
continuitie, or spiritual Inhesion in Christ; yet they have a mathematick,
superficial, and seeming union of contiguitie with, or Adhesion to Christ: they
touch Christ, and adhere to him, as a dead fruitles branch, to the Vine:
Although they are not under the Gracious, and special Inhabitation of the
Spirit, yet may they not be under some commun Illapses, and Irradiations of the
Spirit? So Heb. 6.4. and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost.

7 Prop. 7. As to Christ's Image.
A false friend of Christ may have some slight touches, and strokes of the
Spirit of Sanctification; some first lines, superficial Impresses or stampes of
commun Grace on his heart. We may not say or conceit, as some, that a false
friend of Christ may have true saving Grace: no, this destroys God's (...),
the Covenant of Grace, etc. Yet we may lately conclude, that he may, and often
does, attain unto a great mesure of commun Graces, which have a mighty
Ressemblance with saving Graces, and therefore can very hardly, by human
estimation, be distinguished therefrom. Is it not said, that God gave Saul
another heart, though not a new heart, 1 Samuel 10.9? Do not many begin in the
Spirit, and yet end in the Flesh, as Gal. 3.3?

8 Prop. 8. As to Active obedience.
A false friend of Christ may give a partial, hypocritick subjection, and
conformity to the Laws of Christ. Do we not read of some, 2 Timothy 3.1 -- 5. who
in these last days, should arrive unto a visible form of Godliness, and yet
deny the power or truth thereof; yea continue still under the power of lust?
Have we not had dreadful Instances of this, in these last perilous days? How
many are there, who have sometimes shone like Stars of the first magnitude, in
the Firmament of the Church, and yet now like Meteors, or blazing Comets, lie
buried in the ashes of their burnt profession? O tremble, tremble at this, ye
English Professors!

9 Prop. 9. As to Passive obedience.
A false friend of Christ, may yield, not only Hypocritick Active Obedience to
Christ's Laws; but also some passive obedience to his Cross, and that in a
very considerable degree. Does not Paul, Mat. 13.22.
1 Cor. 13.3. suppose, that a false friend of Christ may give his body to be
burnt, or die a Martyr for Christ, and yet want Divine Charity, or true Amity
for Christ? How far a false friend of Christ may, with courage, suffer
persecution for Christ, seems lively illustrated, Mat. 13.22. by the thorny
Ground, which is more generous than the stony ground, in that, it bears a
scorching day of persecution: and yet after al, the thorns or cares of the
World choke the Corn, when it comes near to Harvest. Have we not had sad
exemples of this also in this our Age? How many Professors have passed through a
bitter Winter of persecution, with courage, and yet after al, been blasted with
a Sunshine day of prosperity, or worldly cares, and comforts?

10 Prop. 10. As to Dependence an Christ.
A false friend of Christ may be brought to a considerable mesure of seeming
Dependence on Christ, both for Providential, Ministerial, and gracious
Influences. Did not Saul consult, and wait on the Divine Oracle, 1 Samuel 13.9,
-- 13? Is it not said of some false friends of Christ, Esa. 48.2.
Esa. 48.2. that they stayed themselves on the God of Israel? i. e. they
presumed, and gloried much in their dependence on Christ, though they really
depended on nothing, but their own Fantasies, and carnal confidences: they
conceit they depend on Christ, but really depend on this their own fond
conceit. And is not this the case of a world of false friends of Christ? O that
it were not.

11 Prop. 11. As to Assistances and Services.
A false friend of Christ may receive great Assistances from Christ, and do
great Services for him. Was not this the case of Judas? Did he not do many
Miracles, and perhaps awaken, if not convert some souls? Oh! what Assistances,
and Enlargements in duties? What Divine Benedictions on their Labors, have many
Ministers, who yet never were real friends of Christ, received from him?

12. 12. As to Praises.
A false friend of Christ may return unto him, some acknowlegement for Divine
Assistances, or other mercies received: So Luke 5.26. And they were al amazed,
and glorified God, i. e. for what they had seen of his omnipotence in the
Miracle wrought.

13. 13. As to communion of Saints. Exo. 12 38.
A false friend of Christ may adhere very close to the more pure Ordinances,
Administrations, and members of Christ. Thus Exodus 12.38. We find mention of a
mixed people, who went up with the Israelites out of Egypt, and endured some
difficulties, to have communion with them; and yet, at last they fell off, as
leaves in Autumn, and returned back again to Egypt, as Numb. 11.4. This is a
terrible contemplation for the Professors of this Age: Thus the foolish Virgins
consociate with the wise, Mat. 25.1.

14. 14. As to communion with Christ. Luke 13.26, 27.
Yea, a false friend of Christ may arrive to some mesure of communion with
Christ, in his Ordinances. This seems the case of those presumtuous Confidents,
Luke 13.26. We have eaten, and drunk in thy presence, and thou have taught in
our Streets. Eating and drinking together, denotes familiar conversation, and
friendly communion. They had often eaten, and drunk with Christ at his communion
Table, and this makes them mighty confident of their Amity with Christ. But
yet Christ rejects them as workers of Iniquity, v. 27. Should not this
consideration make every vein in our hearts to Tremble?

15. 15. As to prelibations of Glory.
A false friend of Christ may arrive unto some labial sips, some superficial
tastes of the Celestial Gift, and of the powers of the Kingdom to come. This
seems couched in that supposition, Heb. 6.4, 5. and have tasted of the Heavenly
Gift, etc. There may be some labial prelibations of coming Glory, arising from
some commun Illuminations of the Spirit, without the least taste of those
spiritual suavities, and satisfying sweetnesses, which the real friends of
Christ find in the Enjoyment of himself; and whereby their lusts after other
things are quenched, as Joh. 4.14. whereas the false friends of Christ never
drink a full draught, but have only some sips of Divine Suavities; which when
gone, make them but more eager and greedy after their lusts.

16. 16. As to expectation of Christ's coming.
A false friend of Christ may in some mesure expect, and wait for Christ's
second coming. Thus it was with the Foolish Virgins, they waited for the
Bridegroom's coming, as well as the Wife, Mat. 25.1.

17. 17. As to Assurance.
Lastly, A false friend of Christ may have a very tenacious, and violent
presumtion of an Interest in Christ, when as many real friends of Christ live^
al their days under great suspicions, fears, and douts touching the same. Thus
it was with the foolish Virgins, Mat. 25.1. and those mistaken Confidents, Luke
13.26. And oh! what dreadful confusion? what Eternal Disappointment, will
multitudes of Professors, at the last day, fall under in this regard, when they
shall come to take their names out of the Lamb's book of life, and find nothing
but a mere blank there? Thus we have concisely shown, how far refined
Hypocrites may proceed, in a seeming Amity with Christ, and yet continue real
enemies to him. Each of these propositions deserve, and may have, if the Lord
give opportunity, a very large Explication, and Demonstration. But I am not
ignorant, that many scrupulous, douting, tender, and troubled Consciences, may
make an il use of these Truths, for the putting off that satisfaction, and
comfort which belongs to them; especially seeing we have not now opportunity,
or place, to explicate, and clear them as we ought: therefore we should advise
such, not to engage their thoughts in any deep consideration of these
propositions, without the Assistance of some Judicious Minister, or friend.
That which we at present design hereby, is only conviction, and soul-confusion
to refined Hypocrites, or false friends of Christ, who take up with some
imperfect Ideas, and groundless presumtions of being the friends of Christ.
You see how near mistaken friendship seems to come, ^o that which is real
friendship with Christ: how much the watered Brass of counterfeit Grace,
ressembles the pure Gold of sincere Grace. Is it not then a very easy matter
for refined Hypocrites to delude themselves, and the most knowing Christians,
with false Ideas, Apparances, and Shadows of seeming Amity with Christ? Oh!
how easy a thing is it for many gifted cunning Hypocrites, to steal quietly to
Hell, without notice taken of their Hypocrisy, either by themselves or others?
Yea, may we not justly conclude hence, that many, who are in the Churches
estimation, as well as in their own, exalted to the highest form of friendship
with Christ, shall at last day be east down to the lowest place in Hell, by
Christ their Judge? And does not all this make thine heart to tremble? then
know, that thy case is by so much the more desperate, and incurable, by how
much the more insensible thou art of thine Hypocrisy. A secure Conscience is
much worse than a tormented.

SECT. 4. The Sin, Folly, and Curse of those, who under a pretended friendship
with Christ, concele their real Enmity against him.
THE more effectually to awaken, 2. Q. What the Sin, folly, curse and plague of
false friendship with Christ is?
and confound false friends of Christ, we proceed to our second Question, What
a sinful, foolish, cursed, wretched state this is, for professors, under a
pretended Friendship with Christ, to cover over, and concele their real enmity
against him. We shall reduce the Resolution of this Question to these three
Heads, or commun places: (1.) The sinfulnes of this state. (2.) The Folly of
it. (3.) The Curse and Plague of it.

1. 1. The sinfulnes of false friendship.
It is a most sinful wicked state, for Professors, under a pretended
Friendship, to concele a real enmity against Christ. And the Iniquity hereof
appears in these severals.

(1.) 1. It is a mocking at Christ.
Is it not an high crime for such as profess friendship to Christ, to mocque
at him? And is not this the case of al false friends of Christ? Do they not
mocque at Christ, who profess friendship to him in words, but deny him in
deeds? So Tit. 1.6. They profess that they know God, but in works they deny
him: Psalm. 36.16. with Hypocritical mocquers.

(2.) 2. It is a wearying of Christ.
Is it not a great piece of Impiety to burden, and weary Christ, who alone
gives rest to poor souls? And can there be a greater burden to Christ's soul,
than this, that such as profess friendship to him, should secretly cherish
enmity against him? So Esa. 7.13. But will ye weary my God also? i. e. by your
unbelief, and false friendship.

(3.) 3 It is most loathsome to Christ.
That must needs be the greatest fin, which is most loathsome and opposite to
Christ, the greatest good. Now what more loathsome to Christ, than an
Hypocritick profession of Amity to him? Thence it is said, Job 13.16.
Job 13.16. For an Hypocrite shall not come before him. The meaning is, he
lothes Hypocrites, as we loath excrements, or dung, which was, by God's
appointment, to be removed out of fight. Hypocrites are the excrements of the
Church, and so most loathsome to Christ. Whence also, he threatens such, Rev.
3.16.
Rev. 3.16. so then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will
spue thee out of my mouth. Lukewarm water has something in it nauseous to
man's Stomach, and therefore Nature is not at ease, til it discharge it self of
it, by vomit. So loathsome and nauseous is a false, lukewarm friend to the
stomach of Christ.

(4.) 4. It does Christ a most mischief.
False friendship with Christ, is a sin of the first magnitude, and deepest
guilt, in that it does Christ the most mischief. A false friend, is but a
masqued enemy. Now it is well known, that the masqued enemy wounds more
effectually than the bare faced. And this is that which adds much weight to
Antichrist's mystery of Iniquity, that he makes use of a pretended friendship
to Christ, thereby the more effectually to undermine his Kingdom. Whence he is
set forth to us under the Emblem of a Leopard, or Panther, which seems a
friend to al Beasts, Revel. 13.2. Rev. 13 2.
And the beast which I saw was like unto a Leopard. The Leopard, by reason of
the beauty of his skin, or sweetness of his odor, allures al beasts to him: So
Antichrist, under pretended friendship to Christ, wounds him more effectually.
And thus every false friend of Christ, is, in his proportion, an Antichrist,
one that under pretended Amity, does more efficaciously betray, wound, and
Crucify Christ. Again, look as Antichrist's false friendship toward Christ is
styled Blasphemy; so, by a paritie of Reason, the pretended Amity of every
false friend is an high degree of Blasphemy: and so it is styled, Revel. 2.9.
And I know the Blasphemy of them that say they are Jews, and are not, but are
the Synagogue of Satan. To profess our selves to be Jews, i. e. members, and
friends of Christ, and not to be so indeed, is an high degree of Blasphemy
against Christ; in that the Hypocrisy and Apostafie of such, when it breaks
forth, gives a mortal wound to Religion, and so brings a scandal on Christ, and
his ways: so great is the Blasphensie of al Christ's false friends.

2. 2. The folly of false friendship with Christ in that it is,
We have in some mesure discovered the mystery of Iniquity, that lies wrapped
up in all false friendship with Christ: We shall now a little examine the Folly,
and Madness that lies couched in the bowels of this sin.

(1.) 1. Selffla terie.
Is it not judged, by wise men, an egregious piece of folly, for a man to be
his own Flatterer; especially if thereby he receive any considerable damage?
Such a fool is every false friend of Christ: for he flattereth himself in his
own eyes, til his iniquity be found to be hateful, Psalm. 36.2.

(2.) 2 Self-delusion.
What greater folly can there be, than self-delusion? And is not every false
friend of Christ a self-deluding, yea, a soul-deluding sinner? Esa. 44.20. A
deceived heart has turned him aside, etc. So Prove. 1.18. And they lay in wait
for their own blood, and lurk privily for their own lives.

(3.) 3. Self-ruine.
Is it not notorious folly for a man man to concele a wound, or plague sore,
which, if not discovered, and searched, will unavoidably prove his ruin? And is
not this the case of every false friend of Christ? What more mortal wound, or
plague of the Soul can there be, than hypocritick Amity with Christ? O the
madness of such false friends!

(4.) 4. Self-confidence.
Does not our blessed Lord tell us that it is egregious folly, to build a goodly
structure on a sandy Foundation? And is not every false friend of Christ such a
notorious fool? Does he not build al his hopes, and Heaven on the sandy
foundation of his own carnal presumtions, and confidences? Such an one is
branded with the black marque of a Fool, by the wisest of mere men, Prove.
28.26. He that trusts in his own heart, is a fool, etc.

(5.) 5. Self-contradiction.
Is not self-contradiction a great piece of Folly? And oh! What a
self-contradiction is every false friend of Christ? Does he not contradict his
own Convictions, Profession, Vows, Covenants, Experiences, Yea, and his own
supreme Interest and Happiness? What a world of self-contradictions are there in
false friendship with Christ?

(6.) 6. It shall ^ be manifest.
What notorious folly is it for a man to study the concelement of his offense
from men, when his Judge sees it, and will at last make it manifest before all the World? Such is the case of al false friends, 2 Timothy 3.9. 2.3, 9.
Their folly shall be manifest to al men. God sees it now, and men shall see it
hereafter. Death and Judgment strips us of al vizards, masks, and false
pretensions of seeming Amity with Christ. We may deceive others, though never
so quick-sighted; Yea, and our selves too now; but can we deceive Christ? Is he
not said to be of a quick understanding, or sent, Esa. 11.3. and therefore able
to smell out the most perfumed Hypocrisies of false friends, to pry into every
vein of it?

(7.) 7. It is a courting a picture.
Is it not stupendous folly to court the picture, and embrace the shadow of our
beloved, but to neglect the person? And is not every false friend of Christ
such a fool in grain? What is the profession of friendship to Christ, without a
real espousing of his person, but the espousing a Name, and rejecting the
Thing; a courting the Picture, or Shadow, but despising the person of our
friend?

3. 3. The curse of false Amity with Christ.
As the sin and folly of false friendship with Christ is very notorious, so
also the curse and plague thereof is extreme malignant.

1. 1. It is the root of a world of spiritual sins.
False friendship with Christ is a monstrous pregnant curse, in that it hides,
feeds, foments, strengthens, and improves a world of spiritual sins. How much
is Unbelief strengthened by it? What a soverain Influence has it on carnal
presumtion, and security? How many gross, and refined errors are produced,
and maintained by it? Yea, the whole body of Antichristianisme is but the
product of false friendship with Christ, as 2 These. 2.10. Again, how much does
it swel the heart with spiritual pride? How weak, impotent, and instable does
it render the heart, as Jam. 1.6, 8? Whence springs al hard thoughts of, and
murmurs against God, but from this evil, bitter root, Exodus 6.9? What feeds
carnal confidence and self-dependence, more than this false friendship? Is not
this also the spirit of self-love, and self-seeking? Farther, whence springs
cursed Formalitie, but from this root? Lastly, What hardens the heart, and
inclines it to Apostafie so much as this evil spirit of false friendship with
Christ, Heb. 3.13? Such an efficacious, and malignant Influence has it for the
Concelement, Confirmation, and Improvement of swarms of spiritual lusts?

(2.) 2. It poisons the best mercies.
False Amity with Christ, as it is the food, and nurse of the worst sins, so
also the poison, and curse of the best mercies. It not only infuses a curse
into temporal mercies, but also into spiritual: it turns the means of Grace
into a means of hardening: it makes the word of God, which is in it self the
savor of life unto life, to be the savor of death unto death, 2 Cor. 2.16. Is
it not a dreadful curse, to have, not only our sins, but also our best duties,
privileges, gifts, commun Graces, evangelick Assistances, ministerial services
for Christ, and Divine consolations from him, converted al into poison, and
fuel for our lusts? And yet this is the case of every false friend of Christ.

(3.) 3. It puts a sting into al Afflictions.
False friendship with Christ puts a sting into al Afflictions, whether
spiritual or temporal. As the worst of Afflictions work together for good to
the real friends of Christ, Romans 8.28. So al work together for evil to his
false friends. A sincere heart finds some of his sweetest and best mercies, in
his most bitter and worst trials: but a rotten false heart finds al cursed to
him.

(4.) 4. Christ leaves such to the ^^ares of this world.
False friendship with Christ provokes him to deliver up such to the
efficacious Inveiglements, Blandissements, and Enchantments of a bewitching,
alluring world. If Christ cannot obtain the whole heart, he will relinquish and
leave it to be possessed by this heart-ensnaring world, that great Idol-God.
And, albeit some sensual secure sinners may account it their Liberty, to be
captivated by the golden chains, and fetters of a smiling world; yet let them
know, by how much the more pleasing the world's chains are, by so much the more
miserable is their curse. Oh! What a deep curse is it to have our Table, our
Relations, our Al become a snare, as Romans 11.9.

(5.) 5. Christ leaves such to the plague of their own hearts.
Christ usually leaves his false friends to the plague of their own hearts. And
oh! What a terrible curse is this? Can there be a greater punishment of sin,
than to be left to the swindge of sin? Is not sin in it self the greatest evil?
Need we then fear a greater curse than to be left by Christ, under the Tyranny
of our own lusts? And lo! this is the curse of Christ's false friends, Psalm.
81.11, 12.
Psalm. 81.11. But my people would not hearken unto my voice, and Israel would
none of me, i. e. they contented themselves with the name, picture, or
profession of me, but yet would not embrace my person: they were friends in
profession, but enemies in Affection: And what follows? v. 12. so I gave them
up to their own hearts lust: and they walked in their own counsels. What a
curse of curses is this? can Hell produce a more terrible plague than this, to
be left to our own hearts lust? Surely no.

(6.) 6. Christ puts a period to the day of Grace.
When Professors go on in a course of Hypocritick friendship with Christ, he at
last puts a period to their day of Grace. Thus he dealt with the unbelieving
Jews, Luke 19.42. Luke 19.42.
saying, If thou had known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things
which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes. Israel had
her day of Grace, but now it is gone; now her Sun is set; now farewell to al
Gospel Grace and offers; farewell to al wooings, and strivings of the Spirit of
Grace with her: Oh! what a complicated, twisted, binding curse is here for all
Christ's false friends? How much better were it to part with the Sun out of the
Firmament; yea, with life it self a thousand times over, than to bid Adieu to
the day of Grace?

(7.) 7. Christ leaves them to Satan the God of this world.
Yet farther; such as proceed in a continued course of false Amity with
Christ, he at length delivers them up to Satan, the God of this world. Thus he
dealt with Judas, that false friend and Traitor, Luke 22.3. Then entered Satan
into Judas. And what follows? v. 4. And he went his way, and communed, how he
might betray him. When Christ, after long wooings, waitings, and strivings,
cannot gain the hearts of his false friends, he at last delivers them up to
Satan, the God of this World, who comes with seven Devils, and possesses the
heart. Will thou not, says Christ, after al my Wooings, and Allurements of
Free Grace, after al my strivings by my Spirit, give me thy whole Heart? Why
then farewell: take him Satan: seeing he would not be my voluntary, and real
friend, let him be thy captive vassal and slave: seeing he would not bend his
neck to mine easy yoke, let him feel the dints and weight of thine Iron Chain.
What an Hel-bred eurse is this!

(8.) 8. Christ self becomes a stone of stumbling.
Again, Christ himself becomes a stone of stumbling, and rock of offense unto
such, as persevere in false friendship with him. When awakened, convinced
sinners have long professed much friendship toward Christ, and yet still retain
some secret Haunts for beloved lusts, or dare not venture the weight of their
souls upon him, the chief corner stone, then he becomes a stone of stumbling to
them. This was the case of the unbelieving Jews, Mat. 21.43. Mat. 21.43, 44.
Therefore I say unto you, the Kingdom of God shall be taken from you; (...),
i. e. For this very cause, because you reject me the head cornerstone, (v.
42.) therefore my Gospel, and my Grace shall be taken from you: and then it
follows, v. 44. And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken, etc. i. e.
I, who am to my real friends the chief cornerstone, will be to you a stone of
confusion, and destruction.

(9.) 9. Judicial Hardness.
Hence follows a spirit of slumber, Judicial blindness, and obduration, or
Hardness of heart; which Christ, in righteous Judgment, at last leaves such
false friends unto. Will thou not, says Christ, see my Beauty, hear my voice,
or embrace me with thine whole heart? why then be content; thou shall not, see,
or hear or embrace me, as thy friend, to al eternity. So Romans 11.8, 9, 10.
According as it is written, God has given them the spirit of slumber; eyes
that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear to this very day,
etc. Hence follows a spiritual stupor, a. cauterized and callous Conscience:
and by how much the more senseless conscience is, by so much the deeper is its
curse.

(10.) 10. A liablenes to all the curses of the Law and Gospel.
Hence the false friend of Christ, falls under all the curses both of the Law and
Gospel; yea, Christ swears against him in wrath. So Psalm. 95.11. Unto whom I
swear in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest. Oh! What a dreadful
curse is this, that comes from the Mediator, the Fountain of al Blessings?

(11.) 11. Al his Hopes passing, but his sorrows eternal and intolerable.
Whence, lastly; all the hopes, and comforts of Christ's false friend are
momentary and vain, but al his woes and miseries are eternal, and intolerable.
Job 8.13. and the Hypocrites hopes shall perish. Job 20.5. And the joy of the
Hypocrite but for a moment. So fleeting and passing are his hopes, and Joys.
But what are his sorrows? surely, they are swift, unsupportable, and eternal.
(1.) His fears shall surprise him, when he is least aware of it. Esa. 33.14.
Fearfulnes has surprised the Hypocrites. Oh! what pannick fears will surprise
Christ's false friends one day. (2.) His disappointment shall be endless, and
without remedy. (3.) And then the hottest place in Hell is reserved for him,
Mat. 14.51. Such are the Plagues and curses of al Christ's false friends. And
that which is sum of al is this, Christ himself will be their eternal and worst
enemy. And will not all this serve to awaken, and convince the false friends of
Christ, how sad and cursed their state is? Oh then! What shall we say? Who can
imagine, what are the Lengths, Breadths, Depths, and Heights of this mystery
of Iniquity; this Hypocrisy, this false Friendship toward Christ, which is
loged in the hearts of many professed friends, yet real enemies of Christ? The
Lord effectually convince us al of this Plague.

CHAP. IX. This Doctrine of Friendship with Christ improved in order to
Heart-examens, Exhortations, and Directions touching sincere closure with a
Christ as our friend.
SECT. 1. Motives, and Rules for the examining of our selves, whether we are
sincere, or Hypocritick friends of Christ.
Use 4. Of Examination.
THis subject of Amity with Christ, as before Explicated, may be usefully
improved, in order to Heart-examens, and a more complete Judgment of our
Christian state. Is there so much required to the constitution of a sincere
Amity with Christ? Are there so many, who by their profession, seem good
friends of Christ, but yet, in their Affection, are real enemies to him? Will so
much of that, which now passes for Friendship with Christ, be one day found to
be no better than enmity against him? And is it so sinful, so foolish, so
dangerous a thing, for any to delude themselves with false Ideas, Pictures, and
Shadows, of Amity with Christ? O then! how greatly does it concern us al, to
examine narrowly every vein of our friendship with Christ? Are we not told in
the Sacred Writ, that few are saved; yea, that the Righteous shall scarcely be
saved? Does it not then much concern us, to take all the heed that may be, that
we be not left out of that small number? Oh! how sad is it to have any
fundamental error; yea, any loose pin, in this great work of friendship with
Christ? And the more effectually to provoke our spirits, Motives to examine our
friendship with Christ.
to a more thorough Inquisition into, and examination of our Friendship with
Christ; Consider,

1. 1. From the Difficulties that attend it.
How many difficulties attend a true and sacred. Friendship with Christ. Is it
not extreme difficult to part with right eyes, and hands, beloved Idols, and
darling lusts, which are professed enemies to Christ? Is it not very hard to
offer violence to corrupt Nature; to disloge sin, and self from the Bent of the
heart, that so Christ may loge, and inhabit there? O! how difficult, yea
impossible, without omnipotent Grace, is it to win an inch of ground on
self-wisdome, self-wil, self-humor, self-strength, and self-righteousnes? What
a painful death is it to die to that adulterous, cursed Idol Self, that so we
may live to Christ? Whoever overcame sin and self, without a world of
Difficulties? And how can we ever hope for friendship with Christ, til we have
our hearts rent from these his professed enemies? It is an easy matter to
become a false, bypocritick friend of Christ; but O! how hard is it to be
really such? there is no great pain, or difficulty in attaining to a Name, and
profession of Friendship with Christ; but what a world of pain, and labor is
there required, to obtain the Thing it self? He that is not sensible of the
difficulties, it is a black sign, he knows not what the thing it self means.
Now then, if it be so difficult a thing to arrive unto a sincere Amity with
Christ, does it not greatly concern us al, to examine well, whether that which
we profess, be of the right make? Does not the difficulty of gaining real
friendship with Christ, lay an essential obligation on al Professors, to make a
narrow Scrutinie, and Inquisition into their hearts, touching the sincerity of
that which they profess? 2 Cor. 13.5. know ye not, that Christ is in you,
except ye be Reprobates?

2. 2. From the facility of being mistaken about the truth of our friendship
with Christ.
Consider, how easy a thing it is to be mistaken in our perfuasions, about the
sincerity of our friendship with Christ. As the thing it self is most
difficult, so our mistake about the truth of it, is most easy. Though the
distance 'twixt true Amity with Christ, and false be vast, and in a sense
infinite, yet the latter does so much ressemble the former, as that it is very
easy to mistake therein. Alas! how much watered brass is there, that passes
for pure gold? How many Idol-Christs are there, which pass for the true
Christ? Is there not much bastard spurious knowledge, that passes for true
saving light? Are there not many adulterous, whorish Affections, which pass
for true conjugal Affections to Christ? How fearfully are thousands of awakened
Professors, deluded with the shadow, or dream of friendship with Christ, when
as they are indeed, at heart, real enemies to him? Have we not cause then to
sift our hearts to the very bran, to shake our selves out of our selves, and to
demand of our selves such questions as these: What a^t thou, as to Friendship
with Christ? How does thy soul stand disposed, and framed toward him? It Is
true, thou have professed long, and much Amity to him; ay but do thou
really, and strongly intend what thou pretendest to be? Thou do pretend to
give him thy heart; but is there no Image of Jelousie, no darling lust loged
there, in the room of Christ? Thou have arrived to some partial, superficial
conformity unto Christ, but yet is there not an inward Difformitie and
disagreement from him? Oh! how much should this verisimilitude, or Ressemblance
betwixt counterfeit and sincere friendship with Christ, awaken and excite our
spirits, to a serious and accurate scrutinie into our own hearts, and states,
as to this particular?

3. 3. From the danger of mistakes herein.
Consider, how dangerous a mistake about our friendship with Christ is. Is not,
friendship with Christ the most fundamental part of Christianity? Is not then
the least error, or flaw herein fundamental? Of what use is a false persuasion
of true friendship with Christ, but to make you steal quietly to Hell, in a
sweet sleep, or golden dream of carnal security? For what serves the Name, and
Notion of a friend, without the thing, but to make thee a more cunning, and
effectual enemy to Christ, and thine own soul? Alas! Alas! a Name is but a
Name, or shadow of a thing: and unless thou have the Thing it self, the Name
of being a friend to Christ, will but serve, as a vizard, or disguise, to
concele a rotten heart, and sink thee deeper into the Abyss of sin and
misery. Does it not then nearly concern us al, to examine thoroughly what our
friendship with Christ is? O that the professed friends of Christ would be very
serious, and punctual in this particular; and never desist, til they have
brought this grand Question, or rather Controversy, to some Head and
Conclusion, of this, or the like import: Am I, or am I not a real friend of
Christ? Have, I elected him for himself, or have I not? Is mine heart strongly
bent for him, or is it not?

Now to come to a full Resolution of this Question, Distinctive Characters of
Christ's false and true friends.
I shall lay down some criterial notes, or distinctive Characters of Christ's
false, and real friends.

1. 1 In point of Essimation.
The true friend of Christ estimes nothing worse than sin, and nothing better
than Christ, and friendship with him: he fears and feels no worse Hell than sin,
that deprives him of Christ; he hopes for, and desires no better Heaven, than
Christ, and the Enjoyment of him, Psalm. 73.25. whom have I in Heaven but thee,
etc. Christ's Presence makes up his Heaven, and Christ's Absence makes up his
Hell. But now is it thus with the false friend of Christ? Has he not some thing
better than Christ, and something worse than sin? Do not some, notwithstanding
al their pretensions to Amity with Christ, secretly prefer some Idol-lover
before Christ? Are not some, who affect the name of friends to Christ, great
Admirers, and Adorers of some beloved sin, which is Christ's worst enemy? Does
not every false friend of Christ prefer his own quiet, peace, and contentement
before Christ, and the Enjoyment of him? Have not the most refined Hypocrites,
and false friends of Christ, something more sweet than Christ, namely their own
ease; and something more bitter than sin, to wit the torment of Conscience?
It Is true, the false friend of Christ may, at times, especially when under the
heats of Conscience, have a Judgment of Conviction against sin, as burning and
tormenting his Conscience; ay but all this while, has he not a secret Judgment
of Approbation for sin, as it brings contentement, and satisfaction to his
heart? Does not his heart secretly approve of it as sweet and delicious, while
his Conscience disallows, and disowns it as scalding, and tormenting.

2. ^. As to aver^ion from sin.
The sincere friend of Christ has his heart greatly broken for, as also broken
off from sin, as sin. 1. As to Heartbreakings for sin.
(1.) His heart is greatly broken for sin as sin: he is deeply wounded for sin,
not only because it gives a wound to his peace, but also because it wounds the
Law, Honor, and Name of his Lord. He is grieved not only for the evil of
Passion or suffering, that follows on sin, but also for the evil of Action or
doing, that lies wrapped up in the nature of sin: The breach which is made on the
Divine Law by his sin, is as much, yea, much more a burden to the friend of
Christ; than the breach that is made on his particular peace: So David, Psalm.
51.4. Against thee, thee only have I sinned. The sense of his loss, in losing
Christ's favor, by reason of his sin, is more to him, than the sense of pain:
yea, he feels the greatest sting, and pain in the loss of God. But is it thus
with a false friend of Christ? It Is true, he is much afflicted for sin; but
why? Is it because it offends and afflicts Christ? no; but because it
offends and afflicts his own Conscience. It is not the evil of doing, but the
evil of suffering he grieves, and mournes under: he is displeased with sin, not
because it displeases God, but because it displeases self.

(2.) 2. As to the Hearts being broken off from sin.
The sincere friend of Christ has his heart broken off from sin: not only his
Judgment, but also the bent of his heart is turned against sin: his Affections
are not only bowed, but broken off from sin: he prefers liberty from sin,
before license to sin: he had much rather be stripped naked of sin, than be
indulged in it. He maintains a daily war against sin, and hates it, even while
he is led captive by it, Psalm. 97.10. Yea, he hates that sin most, which is
most delicious, pleasing, useful, and agreeable to corrupt Nature. But is it
thus with the false friend of Christ? Does he not still retain a prevailing love
to sin, even when that light, which is in conscience, conflicts most against
it? has not his heart a secret hankering after sin, even when he makes most
solemn vows, and covenants against it? Are not al his Convictions,
Humiliations, Covenants, and conflicts against sin, means greatly subservient
to its concelement, confirmation, and growth? Thus, while acts of sin are
suspended, and some branches lopped off, its Soveraintie, and Dominion in the
heart is more violent.

3. 3. As to self-demal and Christ-exaltation.
The sincere friend of Christ makes it his main study, and work to abase self,
and exalt Christ; but the false friend exalts self, and abaseth Christ, in all
he undertakes. First, the true friend of Christ makes it his business to deny
himself, and exalt Christ, in all he does. He would fain abandon, and abjure
himself, that so he might more completely adhere, and cleave to Christ: He
would be lost in himself, that so he might be found of, and in Christ: He would
be spoiled, and stripped naked of al his own sufficiences, that so he might be
clothed with Christ's white raiment, Rev. 3.17. He desires to be a fool in his
own, and the World's eye, that so he may be wise in, and by Christ, 1 Cor.
3.18. He dares not, for a World, be his own flatterer; no, he accounts self
presumtion, a self-hel: he would be always jelous, yea, despairing of himself,
though he would never be jelous, or despairing of his Lord, Ezech. 13.10, 16.
The knowledge of himself keeps him from pride; and the knowledge of Christ keeps
him from Despair. For, not to know a man's self, is the root of pride; and
after a man has known himself in his miseries, not to know Christ in his
Grace, is the root of despair, as a serious a Jansenist observes. Again, a
Cyran Max. 28.
He is very ready to displease his own will and humor, that so he may please his
Lord's: He does renunciate his own Righteousness, that so he may partake of
Christ's, Philip. 3.8, 9. In short, he would be poor in himself, that he might
be rich in Christ; weak in himself, that he might be strong in Christ; dead in
himself, that he might live in Christ, Gal. 2.20. Nothing in himself, that he
might be al things in Christ, Gal. 6.3. Thus he abaseth self, and exalts
Christ. But is it thus with the false friend of Christ? Does he not, in all
undertakements, exalt himself, and abase Christ? Is not self the great Idol,
before which all the Faculties of his soul do bow? Does not that great Diana
self rule al, and Christ stand by as a mere insignificant Cipher? Is not
self-wisdome advanced in the room of Christ's wisdom? Does not self-wil give
laws, yea check, to the will of Christ? Is not self love the great Bell, and
Dragon, that devoureth al love to Christ? Yea, does he not Husband, and Improve
al Divine Illuminations, Assistances, Quickenings, Consolations, and other
gracious Talents for the Interest of Idol-self? It Is true, he does, at times,
deny himself in some things, but is it not that he may the more effectually
promote himself in other things? Is not the Bent of his heart most inseparably
clung to Idol-self, even when, in his profession, he seems most resolvedly
turned against it? Does he not seemingly abase his externe, and carnal self,
that so he may the more effectually exalt his Interne, and spiritual self? Or,
if he does arise to such a mesure of evangelick self-denial, as seemingly to
deny his own self-Righteousnes, and self-sufficience; yet is it not al in
Hypocrisy, that so he may more really, and slily advance the same? Yea, does
not al his pretended self-denial serve only to strengthen, hide, and promote
inward lusts? Such a mere lie is al his seeming self-denial: so greatly does he
seek himself, even when he most denies himself. So much is Christ abased by
him, even when he seems the most to exalt him.

4. 4. As to the Law of God.
The true friend of Christ is dead to the Law, but Married to Christ: He expects
not life by Doing, but by Believing: It Is true, he is alive to the Law, as it
is an evangelick Rule of the Divine Life; but he is dead to it as a Covenant,
Romans 7.4. He has an intimate Union with, Love for, Delight in Christ's Royal
Law of Liberty, as it is an exact Idea, and Image of the Divine Nature; but
yet he abandons, and abjures the Moral Law, as a covenant of works. Yea, the
very Faults, and Aberrations from the Law, which a true friend of Christ is
obnoxious to, do, in the end, make him more in love with it, and obedient to it
as a rule. Whereas on the contrary, his love and obedience to the Law as a
Rule, does indeed alienate his heart the more from it as a Covenant. And the
formal reason of both these contrary regards, and affections, is one and the
same; namely, love to, and dependence on Christ; which under his failures and
defects, make him more humble, dependent, and watchful; and under his
performances, to the Law, more thankful, affectionate, and regardful to Christ.
But now the false friend of Christ, notwithstanding al his pretensions to
Christ, he still remains dead to him, and married to the Law. It Is true, he comes
to Christ as a Mediator, but why is it? is it not to have a legal, or
Evangelick Righteousness of his own, to depend on? Does he not perform al his
duties in obedience to the Law, as his Husband, thereby to quiet Conscience? Is
it not his grand design to exalt the Law as a Covenant of works? Does he not
desire Grace more to pay his debts to the Law, than to walk with, or enjoy
Christ? Is it not greater joy, and satisfaction to him, to content and satisfy
the Law, than to content, and satisfy Christ? Does he not make it his work and
business, to bring forth fruit to the Law, rather than to bring forth fruit to
Christ, Romans 7.4? These are black characters of being Married to the Law.

5. 5. As to Crucifixion to the World.
The genuine friend of Christ makes Christ alone his friend, but the world
Christ's, and his own servant. He makes the world the object, not of his
Fruition, but Use only: nothing but God in Christ is the matter of his conjugal
Amity, Fruition, and satisfaction. So long as he can enjoy Christ, he accounts
that he wants nothing, i. e. no essential part of his Beatitude, albeit he lies
under the Deprivement of Al things: and so on the contrary, although he has a
confluence, and abundance of al things, yet he injoyes nothing but Christ, as
the matter of his Felicity. Thus it was with Paul, Phil. 4.12.
Phil. 4.12. he knew how to abound in all his wants, and how to want, in all his
Abundance. he had got the Art of contentation in the loss of al things; and of
moderation in the enjoyment, or use of them; because he made Christ alone his
friend, and the world a servant to Christ, and himself.

But is it thus with the false friend of Christ? Does he indeed make Christ
alone his Friend, and the world his servant? Does he not rather make Christ his
Servant, and the world alone his friend? Are not al his Thoughts, Studies,
Affections, and Labors, laid out chiefly on the World? Does he not make some
lower inferior good, the chief object and matter of his Fruition, Complacence,
and Satisfaction; and Christ only a matter of use, or means subsvervient to his
Idol-good? Hence, is he not altogether a stranger to that great Evangelick
Mystery, of abounding in all his wants, and of wanting in all his abundance?
When the World smiles on him, with the Affluence of al things, does not his
heart adhere unto, and commit adultery with it? And if the world frown upon
him, is not his heart full of murmurs, storms, and vexatious Anxieties? Such an
Adulterous, Whorish heart has every false friend of Christ, as he is described
to the life, Jam. 4.4.

6. 6. As to the election of a whole Christ, with a whole heart.
A sincere friend of Christ takes a whole Christ, with the whole heart. He
Elects not only the Crown, but also the Cross; the yoke as well as the wages;
the work as well as the reward of Christ. And as he embraces a whole Christ, so
also with a whole heart, Psalm. 119.2. i.e. the Pondus, weight, Bent, or most
prevalent Inclination of his heart, is toward Christ. It Is true, he has some
Will, and at times a Lust for inferior goods; ay but yet he has a stronger Will,
and Bent for Christ: he is, in a remiss degree unwilling, but in an Intense
degree willing to be Christ's. But is it thus with the false friend of Christ?
Does he, indeed, take an whole Christ? or does he not rather pick and choose out
that of Christ, which best serves his turn. It Is true, the notion of a Savior
is sweet to his wounded Conscience; ay but is not the notion of a Lord bitter
to his rebellious heart? A view of Christ's Crown is pleasing; but is not the
contemplation of his Cross, sad, and terrible to him? Again, as he takes a
divided false Christ; so is it not with a divided false heart? He is in some
degree willing to be Christ's; but is he not in a greater degree unwilling? He
has a faint, languishing, superficial will for Christ; but has he not a far
firmer, deeper, and more violent will for Idol friends? so greatly is his heart
divided, Jerem. 3.10. Judah has not turned to me with her whole heart. A
divided Christ, or heart, makes a false friend.

7. 7. As to closures with Christ's person for himself.
A sincere friend of Christ closes with the person of Christ, and that for
himself: He comes to Christ, not only for some good things from him, but for
those good things in him. It Is true, he loves the Gifts of Christ well, ay but
he loves the Giver better: yea, he loves the Gifts, for the Giver's sake. He
comes not to Christ merely as a beggar to a rich man's door; as a Client to his
Lawyer; as a sick woman to her Physician, only to serve a turn, and away
again; but he comes to Christ as a sick woman to her Husband, and friend, who
is both able, and willing to cure her of her maladies, and also to satisfy her
with himself. It Is true, that which first inclines the friends of Christ to
come unto him, is the sense of their need; ay but they know there is no way to
have those needs supplied, but ay a closure with his person: and after some
familiar conversation with him, they then find, by sweet experience, that al
their needs are supplied in the fruition of Christ for himself: they at first
seek, and enjoy Christ for themselves; but afterward they seek and enjoy
themselves in Christ. They know that he that has the Son, has life, 1 John
5.12. and therefore they seek not for life, distinct from Christ, but for
Christ himself as the supreme Fountain, and adequate object, or matter of their
life.

But is it thus with the false friend of Christ? It Is true he loves the gifts
of Christ; but does he not hate the Giver? He affects the bracelets, and
love tokens sent by Christ; but does he not dislike the person of Christ? He
comes to Christ to satisfy and ease his douting, troubled Conscience; but does
he not go to beloved Idols, and Lusts to satisfy and ease his heart? At best,
does he not come to Christ only as a forlorn bankrupt to a bountiful
Benefactor, merely to gain somewhat, whereby to pay his debts to the Law? He
would gladly receive life and Benefits from Christ; but does he not still remain
an enemy to Christ? Is he not altogether ignorant of, and a stranger to those
surpassing excellences, those super-eminent heart-ravishing Beauties and Divine
Suavities that are in Christ? Is not this the great wound and plague of every
false friend of Christ, that he comes to him for life, or some inferior good,
but yet considers not, neither regards that life, and good that is in Christ
himself? How many false friends of Christ are there, who close with him rather
as the way to a temporal, and carnal happiness, than to an eternal, and
spiritual Life? And as for such of them, who take Christ as the way to
spiritual life, is not this their main plague sore, that they come to Christ
for life distinct from himself, and consider not that he himself is, not only
the efficient, but also the chief object of their life?

Now then, there being such a vast difference between the true and false
friends of Christ, does it not greatly concern us al to be much in such
heart-examens to try our selves by these, or such like criterial notes,
whether we are in the number of one, or the other sort? O that al, who pretend to
Amity with Christ, would be faithful to their own souls, and Interest in this
point! What a dreadful curse is this, which remains on the false friends of
Christ, that that they put Darkness for light, evil for good, false for true
friendship.

SECT. 2. Exhortations to such as are apparent enemies, or feigned friends of
Christ, to become real friends to him.
WE have practically improved this Theme of Amity with Christ, Exhortations,
and Directions unto such, for a real closure with Christ, as their friend. We
shall begin with the exhortative part, Exhortations to a complete election of
Christ as our friend.
and endeavor to evince, what essential Obligations; what grounded, and binding
Reasons, or Motives, every Rational creature lies under, for the minding, and
seeking after Amity with Christ. The Reasons, or Motives, which may be urged,
for the enforcement of this Exhortation, are very weighty, pressing, and
binding; and that whether we consider the Object, Subject, Nature, or Effects
of this Divine Amity with Christ.

1. Mot. 1. From the excellences of Christ.
One great Head of Motives, to press apparent enemies, or false friends of
Christ, to a thorough closure with him, as their friend, may be taken from the
perfection of the object, Christ and his Excellences, both Relative, 1.
Relative.
and Absolute. (1.) Let us consider the Relative excellences of Christ, as
Mediator, and see what Argument they afford, to persuade us, to a complete
election of him, as our best friend. Is not the notion of a Savior, and
Mediator, very sweet, and pleasing to condemned Captives? Are not al ambitious
of their Prince's Favor, and Amity? Does any thing so much captivate the heart
of a Malefactor, as the Smiles, and gracious Aspects of his Judge? And shall not
then the gracious Invitations, and offers of Reconcilement from the Lord of
Glory, the great Mediator, and Judge of sinners, captivate their hearts to
him? Are there not hidden Treasures of life, and Grace in Christ? Is he not a
boundless, bottomless Ocean of mercy? Oh! What incomparable sweetnesses;
what heart-ravishing Beauties; What transcendent excellences are there in
Christ, the Mediator? Alas! is it not strange, that such an Husband, such a
Friend, such a Fountain of life, as Christ is, should find so little share in
our hearts, and friendship? Oh that ever Christ should be so large-hearted
toward poor sinful us, and that we should be so narrow-hearted toward him! O
come, come gaze on, admire, adore, espouse, and cleave to this great Mediator.

(2.) 2. Absolute.
Christ is most eligible for himself, if we consider him in his Absolute
excellences. Is not Christ, God blessed for evermore; and so the first
Principle, and Last end of our Beings? And can there be any thing more agreeable
to a rational Being, such as man is, than firm Adhesion to, and Frution of his
first principle, and Last end. Tunc Effectus maxim perfectus est, quando in
suun redit principium: Redeunt autem ad suum principium singulae creaturae, in
quantum sui principii similitudinem gerunt. Aquinas contr. Gent. l. 5. c. 46.
Is it not the ultimate perfection of a rational creature, to return unto his
first Principle, and Last end? And wherein consists this return to our first
Principle and Last end, but in Assimilation to, and election of Christ,
God-man, for our friend? Can human Felicity be formed out of any thing beneath
God in Christ? Does any inferior good suit with that most noble part of man,
his Soul? Does not the supreme perfection of man consist in its union to, and
communion with somewhat superior, yea, infinitely superior to himself? And what
is there thus superior to man, but God in Christ? What can quiet and satisfy
the clamorous desires of an wide-mouthed soul, but somewhat that is Good of it
self, which needs no moderation in the enjoyment thereof? But is there any
thing besides God in Christ, that is [bonum per se] Good of it self? Are not al
inferior goods, good only in order so some higher good? and do they not hence
require moderation in the use of them? But does friendship with, or the
enjoyment of God in Christ admit of any moderation? Can we excede here? Need we
any mesures, or bounds to the fruition of that, which is the most solid, and
substantial Good; a good most uniforme, pure, and without the least commixture;
a good most Necessary, and Absolute; a good most Comprehensiue, and
Self-sufficient; a good most diffusive, and communicative; yea the supreme, and
best Idea of al good? And is not Christ all this? Does not then this most
Infinite, Soverain, Universal, and best Good, best deserve our choicest
Frindship? O then, why are men such strangers to Christ!

2. Another Head of Motives, Mot. 2. From the condition of the soul.
which should provoke, both open enemies, and false friends of Christ, to a
thorough-out closure with him, as their friend, is taken from the condition of
their Souls. 1. Its Origin.
(1.) This Divine Origin of the soul was by some Judaick Tradition, well known
to the Pagan Philosophers; Whence Plato calls the soul (...), a Divine particle
of God, and (...), the Divine Nature: And Aristotle calls it, (...), most akin
to the Gods. Of which see Court of the Gentiles, P. 1. B 3. C. 4. S. 4.
Is not thy soul of a celestial origin? Was it not Inspired, and Infused
immediately by God, as Genesis 2.7? Is it not thence termed the Offspring of God,
Act. 17.28. i.e. of all this inferior World most akin to God? Is it not then a
disgrace, and Reproach. for Human Nature, to contract friendship with any but
God in Christ? Has the soul such a physic or natural cognation with God? Is
it not then a monstrous, prodigious curse, that it should prefer friendship
with Idol-friends, composed of clay, before Amity with the great God, from
whom it descended, and with whom it has such a natural, though not moral,
Ressemblance? Oh! What an infinite Disparagement, and Dishonor is this for
Human Nature, to enter into a strict Amity with sensible Inferior Goods; and
to reject, or neglect friendship with its Creator, who gave it Being, and still
continues to be its most Laudable, Honorable, and Happy Being; that to which it
is most akin?

(2.) 2. Its Nature.
Consider the Nature of thy soul. Is it not Immaterial, Spiritual, and simple?
And can any other Good, but God in Christ, feed, and nourish a spiritual
Nature? Is there any proportion, or suitablenes between carnal objects, and an
Immaterial faculty? Is it not an absurd, incongruous, ignoble thing, for such
a simple, sublime, and elevated Spirit as the human soul is, to mingle with a
dirtie, polluting world, and mean while neglect Christ, who is such a
spiritual, noble good? Quanto forma est nobilior, tanto in suo esse semper
excedit materiam. Unde forma cujus operatio excedit conditionem materiae and
ipsa secundum dignitatem sui esse, superexcedit materiam. Aquinas contra Gent.
l. 2. c. 68.
By how much the more noble any Form is, by so much the more predominant it is
over the matter: and by how much the more it is predominant over the matter, by
so much the more must its operation excede, and surpass the condition of the
matter. This demonstrates the immaterial, spiritual condition of the human
soul; its excellence, and preference beyond al material beings; and how much it
is debased, and disgraced by mingling with material, sensible good, or any
thing inferior to God in Christ. Farther, the Immaterialitie of the soul may be
demonstrated from its Indivisibilitie, Intellectualitie, Reflexibilitie,
Activitie, and separate state. Al which sufficiently demonstrate, that nothing
but God in Christ is an object adequate, and commensurate to the soul.

(3.) 3. Its Capacity.
Remember of what an Infinite Capacity thy soul is. Quanto potentia est altior
tanto respicit objectun universalius. Aquin.
Has it not a vast Intellect, or Apprehensive Faculty, radically apt, were it
but morally disposed, to take in the Glorious Ideas of God, the first Truth,
and Beauty? Is it not also invested with a boundless will and Infinite
Desires, which can never be terminated, or satisfied, but by the Fruition of
God in Christ, the best Good? Is there not in every Creature an Appetite of
Union, and Communion with its choicest good, and best friend? How then comes it
to pass, that the will of man should be so averse from union, and friendship
with Christ?

(4.) 4. Its Activitie.
Consider, the Activitie of thy soul. As it is a spirit of an Infinite
capacity, so also of an unwearied Activitie, and therefore must have some
friend for continual conversation with all. For, by how much the more simple and
noble any Form is, by so much the more vigorous and active it is. Now the
human soul being the most simple and noble of al inferior forms, it must needs
also be the most active. Thus much the Plato, Phaedr. fol. 246.
poor blind Philosopher could by his midnight Philosophy discover: whence he
attributes to the soul, ' Wings, or a winged Chariot, whereby she pursues after
the supreme Beauty or First Truth, and never finds Rest, or Satisfaction, til
she come to the contemplation thereof.' Such is the soul's Activitie. And is it
not much better to spend the vigor and Activitie of thy soul on Christ, the
best friend that ever was, than on Idol-friends? Is it not a great degradation,
debasement, and defilement to human Nature, to spend its Activitie, in
conversation with sensible goods, which are so far beneath it, but neglect
friendship, and communion with Christ? Oh! what vexation, shame, torment, and
bondage follows such an adulterous heart?

(5.) 5. Its Immotarlitie.
Remember thy soul is is an Plato makes the soul to be as God, incomposite,
incorruptible, and immortal: whence being disloged from the body, he says, it
roturnes, (...), to God, that original Idea to whom it is akin, Plato, Phaedo
fol. 55, 56.
Immortal Spirit; and therefore must subsist when thy body is loged in the
Grave, and all the Beauty, Glory, and Sweets of this eye-pleasing world, burnt
to a black cole, or reduced to its primitive Nothing. And what will thou do
when thy soul is disloged from thy body, and stripped maked of al those
Idol-friends, to which it is now chained? Do thou now prefer friendship with
this whorish world, before Amity with Christ? Ay, but what will thou say, or
think, when al these Idol-Gods are rent from thee? What will thou do for a
friend to al Eternity, for thine Immortal soul, if thou make not Christ thy
friend? Perhaps thou cannot now, as thou conceitest, live well enough without
Christ, and friendship with him: But is there not a time coming, when Time, and
the friend, of Time shall be no more? What will thine Immortal soul do for a
friend then, if Christ be not thy friend? But on the contrary, if thou make
Christ thy friend now, he will be so unto al Eternity. Ani^^a est creata in
corfinio ae^^rnitatis and temporis: nam actio ejus secundum quam con^^ngitur
superioribus quae sunt supra tempus, aetern^atem participat, etc. Aquin. contr.
Gent. l. 3. c. 61.
Yea, by adhering unto Christ, who is an eternal good, thy soul will participate
in its mesure, of Eternity it self. For an act is specified by its object:
wherefore the soul sou'ls action, whereby it is conjoined with Christ, an
Eternal Object, does, in a sort, partake of his Eternity; as those acts,
whereby the soul adheres to temporal objects, are said to be temporal. And oh!
what invincible engagements does this lay on thine immortal soul, to elect, and
inviolably adhere to Christ; because hereby it will, in its mesure, participate
of Eternity it self, and eternal enjoyments.

3. Another commun place of Arguments, Mot. 3. From the Nature of Amity with
Christ.
to enforce this Exhortation, is taken from the genuine Idea, and Nature of
Amity with Christ. What is Friendship with Christ, but a Divine Confederation,
Alligation, or binding of the Heart to God, by a solemn League and Covenant of
Friendship? And can there be a greater Felicity, than to have the soul bound,
by an inviolable Covenant of Amity, to the great Jehovah? What? Is it
possible, that a rational Creature should refuse such a sweet, and Divine
Obligation, as this of friendship with Christ? Are not these silken, and golden
chains, whereby a rational soul is bound fast to his chiefest good, more
desirable, than the Iron chains, whereby the heart is fetterd to sensibled
good? Is there any loss, or pain to be feared by having the soul inseparably
glued, and knit to such an excellent friend as Christ is? Is it not a sweet,
and delightsome death to die with longings for, and soul-satisfying
conversation with Christ, our best friend? What is Hell, but separation from
Christ, Psalm. 73.27. and therefore what-greater Heaven may we expect, or
desire, than an Immutable, and Intimate union, and communion with Christ, as
our best friend, Psalm. 73.28? Is it not strange then, that Human Nature, endued
with Judgment, and Will, should be so averse to a Covenant of friendship with
Christ? What? not adhere and cleave to Christ, who is so good a friend, yea
sometimes an only friend? Does the soul receive any Damage by entering into a
strict Amity with Christ? Is it any shame, or disgrace for Human Nature to be
fettered, and chained to Christ, the Lord of Glory? Will any thing render thee
more Happy, than the eternal Blessed Vision, and fruition of the Deity? And
is not this Appendent to, yea formally contained in friendship with Christ?

4. Mot. 4. From the effects of friendship with Christ.
Lastly, To provoke our spirits to an entire Election of Christ as our friend,
let us consider a little the blessed Effects of such an Election. 1. Divine
Life.
(1.) Is not life a very eligible thing? Did not Satan speak the truth, when he
said, Skin for skin, and all that a man has for his life? And is not the life
of the soul by so much the more desirable, than the life of the body, by how
much more excellent the soul is, than the body? Now, wherein consists the life
of the soul, but in friendship with Christ? As the life of the body, Consists
in its union with the soul; so does not the life of the soul consist in union
with Christ, as its Friend? What is spiritual Death, but Disunion from Christ?
Can there be a more natural, uniforme, equal, permanent, excellent, noble and
perfect life, than that which consists in conversation with Christ, our
choicest friend? Is not al other life, though never so seemingly splendid, and
glorious, but a dream, and metaphor, of life; or rather a Shadow of death, if
compared with this life? Yea, does not this bring health out of sickness, life
out of death, Heaven out of Hell?

(2.) 2. Strength.
Wherein consists the Vigor and Strength of Human Nature, but in Election of,
and Adhesion to Christ as our friend? Does not al Infirmity, and Imbecillitie
of body spring from some disunion, obstruction, or distance between the part
and the whole? And do not al our Infirmities of soul arise from Disunion, or
Distance from Christ, our Head? Is not the soul most firm and strong, when it
adhereth most firmly to Christ, its first principle?

(3.) 3. Honor.
What is true Nobility, Honor, and Dignity, but Adhesion to, and
participation of the Fountain of al Honors? Now, as the King is the Fountain of
Honor in his Kingdom, so is not Christ the Fountain of Honor in his Kingdom?
And can there be an higher piece of Honor among Subjects, than to be the King's
Favorite, and friend; to have his eye, and ear, and power to command? And is
not this Honor vouchsafed to al Christ's friends? Have they not his ear, yea,
heart to command, as C. 6. S. 5.

(4.) 4. Liberty.
Wherein consists the formal Idea of Divine Liberty, but in a Divine Amplitude
or Enlargement of State, and Acts, arising from subjection to God, and the use
of al other things in subordination to him? And is not this the immediate and
essential product of Amity with Christ, as before, C. 6. S. 5.

(5.) 5. Riches.
What are Riches, but the Affluence of many useful, and precious Goods? Now, if
Christ be your friend, are not al things yours, 1 Cor. 3.22, 23? Yea, has not
he an admirable faculty of Spiritualizing temporal mercies? Are not the very
commun goods of his friends, sugared, and watered with special favor; dipped in
the blood of the Son of God? And does not this turn curses into blessings,
poverty into riches, salt crosses into sweet mercies? Whereas, to such as are
not friends of Christ, their best blessings are salted with the curse of God.
The sweetest comforts want spirit and blood, without Christ: but to such as are
his friends, there can be no want: an uncovered Tent, a straw Bed, a Pillow of
stone, an emtie Purse, are great riches to such. Yea; by electing Christ for
thy friend, thou come to share in fountain-goodnes; and are not al things
most pure, most sweet, and most copious in their Fountain? Can he want any
thing that is good, who enjoyes the Fountain of al? See C. 6. S. 5.

(6.) 6. Peace.
Wherein consists true Peace, Joy, and comfort, but in a sweet Harmony,
Uniformity, Order, and Agreement of al parts? And whence springs this
Harmony, and Agreement in the soul, but from its firm Adherence to Christ as
its friend?

(7.) 7. Interest.
What is the supreme Interest of a Rational Creature, but to use, and refer al
inferior concerns to his Last end? And is not this also the Immediate, and
proper Issue of Friendship with Christ? Do any more effectually promote their
supreme Interest and Last end, than such as Elect and adhere to Christ as their
best Friend? Thus we see what Demonstrative Arguments, Reasons, and Motives
there are, to induce, and provoke men unto a complete closure with Christ, as
their friend. And oh! what a prodigious piece of folly is it after all this, for
men to persist in open enmity against, or false friendship toward Christ?

SECT. 3. Directions for such as are open enemies, or Hypocritick friends of
Christ, to come to a cordial, and complete Friendship with him.
WE proceed now to the second part of this Use, Divections for attaining to a
complete friendship with Christ.
namely, the Directions for attaining unto a complete Amity with Christ. Art
thou firmly resolved, or well inclined to become a friend of Christ? But art
thou indeed, and in good earnest disposed hereto? Then take the following
Directions.

First, In general, Lay a good Foundation.
look well to the Beginnings of thy friendship; be sure thou lay a good
Foundation. Take this for an Infallible, eternal Truth, The progress, and
perfection of your Amity with Christ, will be proportionable to its Foundation,
and beginning. Wherefore a good Beginning is more than half your work: and, on
the contrary, a bad Beginning is worse than none at al. Let thy Conscience be
never so deeply wounded by the Spirit of Bondage, yea, cast down to Hell, under
Despairing thoughts, and Hellish Terrors; yet, if there be not a fiducial
closing with Christ; thou will prove at best but a conquered Enemy, or slave,
not a faithful friend of Christ. Again, Let thine Heart be lift up to Heaven,
in spiritual Illuminations, and Raptures of Joy; yet if the inward Pondus, or
Weight, i. e. the more prevalent Inclination, and Bent thereof, be not toward
Christ, thou will remain but an Apparent Hypocritick friend, and real enemy of
him. Lastly, let thy Profession, and Conversation be gilded over with never so
many Splendid Titles, Artificial Forms, and Habits of legal Mortification,
pretended Evangelick Sanctity, Purity, and Piety seemingly Angelick; yet if
thine Heart be not sound, and sincere, al thy Glorious Titles, and Forms of
Godliness, and Friendship with Christ, are but begun in Hypocrisy, and will
unavoidably end in Apostasy. Therefore thou see how greatly it does concern
thee, to look well to the Foundations, and Beginnings of thine Amity with
Christ: For if it begin il, it can never end well. Loose work, or any
fundamental error in thy first Election of Christ, will cause a crack in the
whole Structure of thy friendship with him. If thou begin but a seeming,
Hypocritick friend, thou will and a real, and open enemy of Christ. Oh then!
of what infinite concernement is it, to use al manner of Caution,
Circumspection, and Diligence in laying a good Foundation, for a sound and
lasting friendship with Christ? O beware, beware, of false, superficial, or
rotten foundations! If thou will build a lasting Structure of Amity with
Christ, such as may reach up to Heaven, thou must lay the Foundation almost as
low as Hell: namely, thou must dig deep, not only into sin, but also into self;
and never leave digging, til thou come to an holy and humble self-despair;
which is a kind of felt Hell, yet the Gate of Heaven, and friendship with
Christ. For self-despair is a door to Faith, and Hope in Christ. But we descend
to particulars.

As in man's Body, there are two great and principal parts, the Head, which is
the Fountain of Animal Spirits, and thence the seat of Sense, and Judgment; as
also the Heart, which is the Fountain of vital Spirits, and so the seat of Life
and Affections: The life of Friendship consists in Freedom tempered with
Wisdom and Faithfulness. The main Foundations of Friendship with Christ. 1. A
prudent Head.
So in like manner in all Friendship there are two great principal parts, and
Foundations, (1.) A prudent Head. (2.) A vital, loyal, or Faithful Heart. Now
proportionable hereto, there are two main, and principal parts, and Foundations
of our Amity with Christ. (1.) A prudent, sanctified Head, or Judgment. (2.)
A vital, loyal, Faithful, or Honest Heart.

1. One principal part, and main Foundation of Amity with Christ, consists in
a sanctified prudent Head, or a wel-principled, awakened, and serious
Judgment. As the Head is the top of the body, the seat of Animal Spirits, and
therefore the Guide of a man; so spiritual Judgment is the Guide of a friend
of Christ. Saving Light, and Sanctified Wisdom is the very life, and Soul, not
only of our first closures with Christ, but also of all the following parts of
Christianity. And this is to me a great maxim in Divinity, That according to
the Nature, and mesure of our Light, and Judgment, touching Christ, and his
concerns; such will be the Nature, and mesure of our Amity with him. If our
Light be, as Joh. 8.12. The light of life, i. e. a real, spiritual, clear,
distinct, certain, feeling, and Active Light, or Judgment; then will our
Election of him as our friend, be single, cordial, complete, and firm. So also
as to the mesure, if our Light be intense, strong, growing, and noontide; then
will our friendship with Christ be exceeding warm, flourishing, glorious, and
operative. Such an intimate Connection is there between saving Light, or
sanctified Wisdom, and friendship with Christ. But oh! how rare is it to meet
with such a sanctified Head, such a saving Light of Life, or Judgment? Are
there not a world of seeming friends of Christ, who have their Heads stuffed,
and crammed with airy Notions, fine spun Ideas, or curious speculations of
Christ, and Evangelick Truths; who yet never had any one beam, or spark of this
true Light of life, or sanctified Judgment? A Sanctified prudent head. Which
implies, 1. An Head well principled with Habitual Notions of Christ.
Wherefore it is necessary that we give the true character, the exact Idea, or
Just mesure of this sanctified, Prudent Head, which is so Fundamental to the
constitution of a sincere Amity with Christ.

(1.) It must be an Head wel-principled, or endued with a stock of sanctified,
habitual Ideas, or Notions touching Christ, and his evangelick concerns;
especially such as refer to friendship with him. This is essential, and
fundamental to the constitution of a Divine Amity with Christ. For if there be
not a considerable mesure of Habitual Light, or Sanctified Evangelick Notions,
touching Christ, his Excellences, Laws, and the Benefits we receive by him, how
can the soul fall in love with him? Who ever judiciously loved that, whereof he
never had any right Notion, or conception? In brief, if thou will become a good
friend of Christ, get a true Idea, or right notion of Christ's Relative, and
Absolute perfections; How full of Grace, and Truth he is; what an Infinite
plenitude of Life dwells in him; How willing, and ready he is to fill every
emtie heart; to enrich every poor soul; to refresh every weary and heavy laden
sinner; to heal every wounded soul; to revive every dead and drooping spirit;
to justify every self-condemned sinner, that comes unto him. Get also a right
Notion of all the Absolute perfections of Christ: touching those ravishing
Beauties, and Transcendent excellences that shine in his person, as he is the
Son of God, and express Image of his Person. Farther, thou must have right
Ideas of thine own sin and misery; and thence of thine absolute necessity and
need of Christ; as also of the covenant of Grace, and the Terms on which
Christ is offered to thee.

(2.) 2. An awakened Head.
It suffices not, that thou have an head wel-principled, with Habitual notions
of Christ, but thou must also have an awakened Head, or an actual feeling
Judgment of Christ and his Affairs. Habitual Notions, without an actual
feeling consideration of things, is but a sleepy, and dreaming knowledge; that
which will never work the Heart, to any real closure with Christ as our friend.
The Head is the Fountain of the senses; and if these be bound up by vapors, or
decay of spirits, sleep presently follows: So here, if Conscience, which is the
seat of spiritual sense, be bound up by the vapors of sin, what follows, but
spiritual slumber, and dreams; which dis-spirit our Friendship with Christ? The
more awakened, actual, and Feeling our Judgment of Christ is, the more firm
will our friendship with him prove. A sleepy, dreaming, and infensible knowledge
of Christ, breeds only a loose, broken, variable, and false Amity with him.

(3.) 3. A serious Head.
A Sanctified, prudent Head, implies also a serious, considering, deliberative
Judgment. None make better friends of Christ, than such as pounder, must, and
pore most upon him. A rash, unadvised Head is a very bad Foundation for
Friendship with Christ. The plodding, contriving Head, if it fix on a right
matter, is usually attended with a fixed Resolution, and invariable will. If
thou desire to be a Loyal friend of Christ, be much in spiritual
consideration, consultation, and advice touching Christ, and thine Adherence to
him. The wisest friend, if good, is usually the best.

(4.) 4. A working Head.
A sanctified Head is also a working Head: Active prudence, if it pitch on a
right object, is always best. Nothing so strong, as a sanctified Judgment,
backed with experience, and Affection. And if the Judgment be wel-grounded, and
strong, the friendship cannot be weak, or staggering. A lazy, slothful
Judgment ever breeds a loose, superficial Amity with Christ. So much for the
first Foundation, namely a sanctified, prudent Head.

2. 2. Foundation for friendship with Christ is a Loyal Heart.
If thou will arrive to a solid, entire Amity with Christ, get, not only a
sanctified, prudent Head, but also a Loyal, faithful, and sincere Heart. This
is the main fundamental, and principal part of Friendship with Christ. A
prudent Head, without a faithful, and sincere Heart, never makes a good friend,
either of men, or Christ. Now this Loyal, sincere Heart consists of two parts,
(1.) A Broken Heart. (2.) A Sound Heart. Of each in order.

1. 1. A Broken Heart.
If thou will lay a good foundation for friendship with Christ, thou must be
sure to get a Broken Heart. For a Broken heart is best disposed to close with,
receive, and entertain a whole Christ. A broken spirit he will not despise,
Psalm. 51.17. The Sacrifices of God are a Broken spirit, etc. Now this Broken
Heart implies, 1. An Heart Broken for sin.
(1.) An heart deeply Broken, and wounded for sin. Corrupt Nature is extreme
lofty, stout-hearted, and unbroken: it cannot bend, or stoop to terms of
Reconcilement with Christ; yea, it makes a sport of Christ, 'til the Spirit of
Bondage come, and break it to pieces: the secure sinner sleeps on, and never
wakes, 'til the Law, by its terrors and fears shake him: Christ and Heaven, are
most sweet to them, who have been shaken over the flames of Hell, and almost
sinothered by the smoke thereof: there is an Evangelick sense of Hell, which
much conduces to Christ's Heaven. 'Christ's Palace-work (says Ruther^^
a Reverend Divine) and his new dwelling laid upon Hell felt, and feared, is
most firm: and Heaven-grounded, and laid upon such an Hell, is surest work, and
will not wash away with Winter storms. It were good that Professors were not
like young Heirs, who come to their rich Estate, long ere they come to their
Wit, and so lavish it.' It cannot be expected that the soul should be raised up
to faith, and Amity with Christ, before it has been cast down by fears, and
terrors of Conscience; at least so far, as to make it sensible of the need it
has of Christ. (2.) 2. An Heart Broken off from fin, and self.
A Broken heart includes an Heart Broken off from sin, and self. That
Freindship with Christ, which is not founded on aversion from sin, and self, is
but emtie, and airy, and will serve only as wings to carry you to Hell: such a
Form of Amity with Christ, is without life, and power: it makes you only more
cunning enemies to Christ, and your own souls. There must be a plowing up the
fallow ground of sin, and self, before the seed of friendship with Christ will
spring up.

2. 2. A sound Heart. Ps. 119.80.
If thou would lay a sure foundation for a stable Amity with Christ, thou
must get not only a Broken, but also a sound Heart. So Psalm. 119.80. let mine
heart be sound in thy Statutes. (...), immaculate, entire, perfect, or wanting
nothing. The wise man tells us, the heart of a fool is nothing worth: and why?
Because he wants the best part of his heart; he is hollow-hearted, or rotten at
the Core, unsound in heart; and therefore shall be, one day, ashamed of his
folly, and hypocrisy. But, says David: Let mine heart be sound in thy
Statutes; that I be not ashamed, i e. that I may approve my self a loyal friend
to thee, and so never be ashamed of my profession. It Is true, David was subject
to many imperfections: he had many specks, and defects, as some sound Apples
have: ay but yet he was not rotten at the Core, as Hypocrites are: the inward
frame, and Bent of his heart was sincere and sound. Though the friends of
Christ be subject to many imperfections, yet the inward constitution, and frame
of their hearts is sound and upright; and this keeps them Loyal, and Faithful
to Christ: whereas the rotten-hearted friend of Christ, be his profession never
so golden, and splendid, yet, because rottennes possesses the frame and Bent
of his heart, he shall at last be ashamed and confounded. A rotten, hollow
Heart, although it may seem never so beautiful, and Glorious, always proves
disloyal to Christ. There is no durable friendship, but what springs from a
sound Heart: which implies,

1. 1. A living Heart.
A living Heart. Life, they say, begins at the Heart; so does Amity with
Christ. Art begins with externes; but Nature, and life begin with Internes: The
Heart is the first that lives, and the last that dies: so here, true friendship
with Christ begins with a living Heart. Therefore if thou would really be,
what thou do profess thou art, a friend of Christ, be sure thou mind more
the inward life, and power of Grace in thine Heart, than externe Forms,
Apparences, and Shadows thereof. It is Sage, and great Advice, which the
serious Jansenist gives to young Converts. S. Cy an I. tty. Chrest. Max. 14.
'In the beginning of Conversion, we should not affect to appear devout before
the eyes of the World, by some promt, and exterior change, which comes under
public view; but retain our selves, and the new sentiments of piety, which
Grace inspires, within the secret of our Hearts; that so the Renovation of our
souls be discovered, rather by our Actions, than by our externe mines, gestes,
and behavior.' O that green, and young friends of Christ would observe this;
and more studiously intend the interne Life, and power of Grace in the Heart,
than the externe Form thereof.

2. If thou desire to approve thy self a loyal friend of Christ, 2. A single
Heart which Implice,
then industriously labor after a single Heart. This is another essential
branch, or part of a sound Heart. Now this single Heart implies both a single
Object; and also single Motives, or Ends. 1. The Election of a fingle Christ.
(1.) If thou will have a single Heart toward Christ, thou must let a single
Christ possess thine Heart. For such as the object, under its formal
constitution, is, such will our Hearts be: If thou elect a double Christ, i.e.
add any thing to, or compound any thing with Christ, thou will have a double
Heart: O beware, beware, how thou mix the World, the Law, Sin, or Self with
Christ! Fie, Fie, on that adulterous whorish Heart, which would fain loge
somewhat besides Christ, in the bed of its Affections! Christ must lie his
alone in the Bent of the will, or he will have nothing to do with that soul.
Alas! how many make a commun Strumpet of their Heart; let it lie in commun for
Christ, and for any Idol-lover? Thou must defy right-hands, right-eyes, and al
other Idol-lusts, or Lovers, if thou will be a loyal friend of Christ. Yea,
self in its whole latitude, whether wise, conceited, Religious, moral,
Righteous, or Evangelick self, must stand by, as a mere cipher, that so Christ
may possess the room of self. Thou must die to al other Lovers, if thou will
live to, and with Christ, as thy Friend. We have al too much of an adulterous
love, and whorish Heart; which is inclined to loge something besides Christ in
his Royal Bed; and therefore the Lord is pleased to allure such, as belong unto
the Election of his Grace, into a Wildernes-condition of much spiritual
Bondage, Tentations, Desertions, Deadnesses, Discomfitures, Hurries, and other
Afflictions, not a few, thereby to banish al Idol-lovers from the Heart. Oh
then! Why will not poor awakened souls fall in with the design of their Lord,
and let him have his alone in the Royal bed of their conjugal Affections?
Christ will be Al or None.

(2. 2. Single Motives of our Election.
If thou will have a single Heart toward Christ, then let the Motives of thy
Friendship to him be single. As thou must elect a single Christ for thy friend,
so also the motives of thine Election must be single. Now the motives of any
action are of the same Nature, and have the same Influence with the end: for
the Last end is the supreme motive of every Action. So then, to have single
motives of our friendship with Christ, is to have a single Intention, or
Intuition of right ends, in our election of him. This is called in Scripture a
single eye, Mat. 6.22.
Mat. 6.22. If therefore, thine eye be single, i. e. If thou have a single,
pure Intention; if there be no squint eye, no oblique regards to private ends.
A single heart takes Christ not only for the Loaves, but for himself; not only
as the way to profit, but as the way to life; not only to cool the heats of
Conscience, but also to quench the fire of lust in the heart; not only to
satisfy the Law, and its demands, but also to satisfy the Heart, with the
Fruition of Christ himself. Such are the motives of a single Heart, and such
ought to be the motives of thy friendship with Christ. Thus the Spouse
Characteriseth the friends of Christ, Cant. 1.4.
Cant. 1.4. The upright love thee, i.e. such as have an upright, single
Intention, right ends, or strait motives; they, and they alone have a sound,
sincere love of Friendship for thee: such as have a double heart, or (as the
Psalmist, Psalm. 12.2.) an Heart and an Heart, an Heart for Christ, and an heart
for Idol-lovers, such are false friends.

3. 3. An Entire Heart.
A sound Heart is an Entire Heart: As thou must take Christ with a single
Heart, which refers to the Object and Motives, so also with an Entire, whole
Heart, or thou will never make a loyal friend of Christ. This indeed follows on
the former: for if the Heart be double as to the object, and motives, it can
never be in it self Entire. The Composition, or Duplicitie of the object, ever
breeds a Division in the Faculty, or Subject; which destroys al friendship
with Christ. Integrity of Heart is Essential to al true Amity with men, but
much more with God. Ps. 119.2
So Psalm. 119.2. Blessed are they that seek him with the whole Heart. i.e. (1.)
They who seek nothing but God himself; (...)
or if they seek any thing else but God, it is for himself. Thus God is to be
loved with the whole heart, i. e. he is to be loved alone; or if any thing else
besides God be loved, it must be loved for God, and in God. For he that loves
any thing besides God, which he loves not for God, loves that thing more than
God, and so makes an Idol of it: they that love Christ with the whole heart,
love nothing but Christ for it self. (2.) To seek God in Christ with the whole
heart, is to have the prevalent part of the heart toward him: and they who
have the prevalent Pondus, or Bent of their Hearts toward Christ, they are
indeed sound-hearted, and Loyal friends. In moral estimation, the major,
prevalent part passes for the whole: if Christ has the prevalent part, or
Bent of the will, he was the whole: but if you give him only the lesser part, i.
e. some Velleitie, or conditionate will, some wishings, and wouldings, some
loose desires, you give him nothing. If you give Christ only a faint,
languishing, incomplete will, you are so far from becoming his Friends, as that
you do indeed render your selves more spiritual, cunning, and mortal enemies to
him thereby. For such imperfect Velleities, or conditionate, languid desires,
and will toward Christ, being soon overcome, and born edown by the prevalent
Bent of the Heart toward Idol-lusts, and other Lovers, they serve only to
concele, corroborate, and improve those seeds of enmity, which lie dormant in
the Heart, against Christ. O then take heed, how thou content thy self with
some languid, faint wishes, or conditionate desires after Christ: believe it,
he will have the Bent of the will, or nothing. If thou divide Christ, or divide
thine heart 'twixt Christ and the World, thou will never have him. As thou must
reserve nothing of the Bent of thy heart for any but Christ. Believe it, as a
piece of Christ will not suffice thee; so a piece of thine heart will not suffice
Christ. Beware then, how thou divide thy narrow Heart: remember al is too
little for Christ: it will not serve him and any Idol; he will have al or none.
Give Christ therefore his due, an entire, complete Heart: be wholly for him,
and then expect, that he be wholly for thee: Let al other suitors stand by, and
Christ alone possess the conjugal Bent of thine Heart. Know, that Christ's
Jelousie will not admit a Division of thine Heart: a little love for other
friends may be too much, but much love for Christ, is too little, in a soul
espoused to Christ. If thou will be a loyal friend of Christ, thou must get a
determined, resolute, peremtorie will for him: thou must contend and wrestle,
with an holy violence, for Christ; and resolve not to be put off with any thing
but Christ. Yea, though Christ seems to turn his back on thee, yet follow him
still, even to the Gates of Hell, and then thou shall with the Syrophenician
woman, find a Heaven of Friendship with him. Christ loves such holy
Importunity, and contention: loveviolence, is very pleasing unto Christ: He
that will not be denied, shall be sure to find Christ.

4. 4. Get a flexible Heart.
A sound Heart is a flexible heart. A dead Heart is very stiff, and
inflexible; but a living sound heart is very Flexible, and yielding to Christ.
It Is so in Nature, dead Carcasses are very stiff and unpliable, but a living
body has its parts very pliable. If then thou would have a sound Heart
toward Christ, be sure that thy heart be very flexible toward him.
Flexibilitie, is essential to the constitution of Amity amongst men: If both,
or each be of inflexible, cross, stiff Humors, there will never be a lasting
friendship. Stout-hearted sinners are, in Divine estimation, far from Christ,
and friendship with him, Esa. 46.12. If thou art ambitious of being a loyal
friend of Christ, thine Heart must be flexible, and pliable. (1.) To the Terms
of his Covenant, and his Evangelick offers of Grace. (2.) To his Royal Laws,
especially such as relate to friendship with him. (3.) To the workings and
operations of his spirit of Grace. (4.) To his providential occurrences, in a
way of passive subjection, and submission. Thus thine heart must be flexible
toward Christ; albeit inflexible, and resolute against sin, and al
Idol-friends.

5. 5. Get an Honest sincere Heart.
A sound Heart is an Honest, sincere Heart, such as really intends what it
pretends unto: such an heart is essential to true Amity with Christ. So Luke
8.15. An honest, and good heart, are joined together. This honest heart is
opposed to a guileful, deceitful, lying Heart; which is repugnant to friendship
with Christ. So Esa. 63.8. The friends of Christ are called, Children that will
not lie, i. e. they really Intend, what they pretend unto: there is an
Harmony, and conformity betwixt their Affection, and Profession; they would
really be what they profess they are: there is no guile found in their mouths,
or profession, Rev. 14.5. Such a friend was Nathaniel, Joh. 1.47. An Israelite
indeed in whom is no guile: If thou have any prevalent degree of Hypocrisy, or
guile in thine Heart, thy friendship with Christ will never be good, or sound.
It Is true, the friends of Christ find, and feel too many Relics, and Spices
of Guile, and Hypocrisy in their Hearts: ay but this is their burden; which
they groan under, and hate, and conflict against: neither have these Remains of
Hypocrisy any prevalent Dominion in the soul: neither does the Bent of the
Heart mingle with, Ephesians. 6.24. (...) Vox ad animun relata: legitur and I it 2.7.
In ^lossar^o (...) incortu^tus. Utuntur Plato and Demosthenes. (...) sensu
^odem. Grot. in loc.
or approve of them. Look well then to this, that thine heart be honest and
sincere with Christ, Ephesians. 6.24. Grace he with all them that love our Lord
Jesus Christ in sincerite, (...), i. e. with a pure, virgin, incorrupt love;
such as has no prevailing mixture of Guile, or adulterous Affection; such as,
by no blandissements of this heart-hewitching world, by no solicitations of
sin, and Satan, can be inveigled, or enticed from Christ. O study, labor,
contend, pray, wait, and seek for such an honest sincere heart: such, and such
alone makes a sound-hearted friend of Christ.

CHAP. X. Admonitions, and Advice to the friends of Christ, for the Living up
to the Dignity of this their Relation.
SECT. 1. To Study, and Admire the excellences of Christ's Person, Love, and
Grace.
Use 5. Of Admonition and Advice to the Friends of Christ.
THis Doctrine of Amity with Christ, furnishes us also with much matter of
Admonition, and Advice to such as are indeed the friends of Christ, that they
would make it their main Study, and Endeavor to Act, Walk, and Live up to the
Dignity of their Relation, and State. This use may be branched forth into many
particulars.

1. 1. To Study and Admire Christ's Excellences.
Is Christ so good a friend; so much eligible for himself? O then! how much are
the friends of Christ obliged hereby, to Study, Admire, and Adore the
Superlative, Transcendent excellences of this their friend? What is there more
efficacious to improve friendship amongst men, than familiar, and fresh
contemplations of the excellences, that are loged in our friend? Is not this
ingeniously expressed by the Moralist, (...).
who makes al love to come from contemplation? Who are they that slight
Christ, but those blind sinners who say, Cant. 5.9, 10.
Cant. 5.9. What is thy Beloved, more than another Beloved? They wanted eyes to
contemplate his Beauties, and therefore no wonder, if they wanted hearts to
love and embrace him, as their friend. But as for the Spouse, who well
understood his excellences, Oh! how does she cry him up? What a great friend
was he in her eye, and heart? What an admirable Character does she give of him?
v. 10. My Beloved is white and ruddie, etc. She had well studied the
incomparable excellences of Christ, her friend, and therefore her heart was
inflamed with Affections toward him. Oh! what infinite Attractives are there
in Christ, to draw forth the Attention, Intention, Admiration and Adoration of
his friends? Is there any thing in the World that may be compared with Christ?
Take the most excellent, and glorious pieces of the Creation, and what are they
but mere Vanity, and poor, withered shadows, if compared with Christ? What is
the World's Al, but pure nothing, if compared with the transcendent Glory of
Christ, the great Al? O ponder, muse on the attractive excellences of Christ!
What a soverain Influence have musing, pondering thoughts, or Spiritual, deep,
contemplation of Christ's excellences, on our friendship with him? Is it not
thus amongst men? Do not lively, and fresh Thoughts of our friend, though
absent, mightily inflame the heart with love unto him? What is it that makes
many impotent, effeminate, amorous Lovers, so much to dote on their beloved
Idols; but frequent, eye-pleasing views, and porings on their Skin-deep, fading
Beauty? And can we imagine that the spiritual, fixed contemplation of Christ's
ravishing Beauties, and Glories, by an eye of Faith, will not have a more
efficacious Influence on his friends, to inflame their hearts with friendship
toward him? O! Would men but study, pore on, and admire the incomparable
excellences, and perfections of Christ, what admirable friends would they be?
How would their Hearts be ravished with Love unto him? What infinite
complacence, and satisfaction would they find in communion with him?

(1.) 1. Study the Beauties of Christ's person.
What more Attractive than Amiable Beauty? And is there any thing imaginable
so Beautiful as Christ? What is Beauty, but a connatural Amenitie, or sweet
Amiablenes of form and figure, arising from a natural, wel-tempered
complexion, situation, and proportion of al parts? And are these Ingredients of
Beauty any where to be found, in such a super-eminent degree, as in Christ? Is
he not, in regard of his complexion, styled white and ruddie, Cant. 5.10. which
are estimed colors most predominant, in Beauty? Does not the Spouse give him
this Character? Cant. 1.16. Behold thou art fair, my Beloved, yea pleasant:
(...), i.e. amiable, beautiful, acceptable, every way heart-ravishing, Is there
any thing in the world more Beautiful than the Sun, and its light shining in
its Meridian Glory? And is not Christ's Beauty set forth by that of the Sun,
shining in its strength, Rev. 1.16? Oh! what an Infinite, Glorious Sun of
Righteousness is Christ? How Beautiful are the beams of his Glorious light? O
come, come, al ye friends of Christ, and behold this your King in his Beauty,
as Esa. 33.17. O gaze, gaze for ever, on this your friend! let the eyes of your
understandings spend their vigor, in Heart-affecting contemplations, and views,
of those admirable glories, that shine in the person of this your dearest, and
best friend; and never desist, til your hearts be ravished with, and captivated
to him.

(2.) 2 Study Christ's Goodnature, love, and compassions toward his friends.
Study, admire, and adore greatly the suavities, or sweeinesses of Christ's
Nature; the wonders of his love; and the Tendernesses of his compassions
toward his friends. Oh! What an incomparably Goodnature has Christ? How
admirably sweethumored is he toward his friends? Were any of Christ's friends
ever troubled with causeless cross Humors, and vexatious carriges from
Christ? Is not his Nature made up of unparalled sweetnesses? O study, and dive
deep into Christ's Goodnature, and sweet Humor: What Divine Suavities possess
his Nature? How wel-tempered his spirit is? How free from al morose, sour, il
humors his Nature is? There are many eminent Qualities in Christ, which render
him of an incomparably sweet Nature. (1.) His Nature, as curiously framed by
the spirit of God, is of a surpassing finer make, than al other human yea
Angelick natures. (2.) His Human Nature was Graced in, and from the Womb. It Is
sin that makes our Human Nature, so morose, so sour, so il-conditioned: but
Christ's nature is clothed with pure Grace; and therefore most sweet, most
benign, most wel-tempered.

2. Christ's Love.
Study also, and admire the wonders of Christ's Love to his friends. O that
ever such an Infinite Mass of pure spotless Love, should mingle with Sinful
Dust, and Ashes! Oh! What a free undeserved Love is this? Who could ever have
imagined, that poor, deformed, bankrupt Rebels, should obtain a share in such
love, and that without hire? What? was our Emmanuel content to espouse human
clay, and assume it into such a substantial marriage, or hypostatick union with
the Deity, thereby to reconcile Heaven and Earth? Did he borrow a human Heart,
and Affections to embrace us? Human bowels, and compassions, to Sympathise with
us? human eyes, to weep for us? human breath, to groan for us? a human tongue,
to plead for us? human flesh, to sweat drops of blood for us? a human Head, to
be crowned with thorns for us? human arms and legs, to be pierced for us? a
human body, to bleed for us? a human soul, and life, to die for us? O the
Altitudes, the Profundities, the Latitudes, and Longitudes of this Love! That
the Soverain Lord of Glory, should breath forth such flames of insinite love,
in human flesh and blood! O the Infinite condescensions of this Love! What?
does the Lord of Glory stoop so low, as to embrace poor worms, crawling on
the dunghill of sin? Is the King of Kings content to enter into a league of
Amity with miserable captives? Does the great God woo, and beseech his sinful
ercature, to become his friend? Oh! What a boundless, bottomless love is
here? What vigor, and force, is there in this Love? How heart-charming, and
soul-conquering is it? What delight does it take in gaining, and triumphing
over stout, rebellious hearts? How much does love in Christ outrun sin in us?
Did not Christ begin with love to us, albeit we begin with hatred to him? Was
not our Heaven first framed in the Heart of Christ? Did not his love contrive
the way to Heaven for us, long before we had being, much less love for him?
Does not he love, such as others hate, even Enemies? And does not his love
out-work Devils and Hell? Is there any power so strong, and efficacious as
Christ's love? How Industrious, laborious, and unwearied is it? How ineffable,
how unsearchable is it? O Study, Study, what are the Lengths, Breadths,
Heights, and Depths of this Love! Believe it, this is the sweetest, and best,
yea only study, for the friends of Christ. The more we study this Love of
Christ, the more we may study it: there are fresh veins of excellence, new
Treasures, and riches to be found in it, every day. This will be the wonder of
glorified Saints, and Angels to al Eternity. Alas! why is it that our hearts
sink, and despond under our Discouragements? How comes it to pass, that our
Hearts are no more inflamed with Love to Christ? Is not this one main Reason,
because we do not Study, and Admire this Love of Christ, as we ought to do?
What vigor, and strength does the study of this Love, infuse into all the
Ini^uragements of faith? How much does it raise up the soul under al its
Discouragements? What a veil of Disgrace, and Contemt does it cast on all the
goodlines of the Creature? How greatly is the soul raised to communion with
Christ, by the study of his Love?

3. Christ's compassion and tender nesses.
Study also the Tendernesses of Christ's care, and compassion toward his
friends. Is he not mindful of them, when they are forgetful of him? Does he not
think much good for them, often when they think il of him? Though he may be
sometimes out of sight, yet is not even then his heart with them? Does he not
long for, and bleed over them, when he seems to be departed from them? It Is
true, he sometimes suspends the tokens of his love, and marquis of Divine
favor: ay but, are not these his suspensions wrapped up in many secret
invifible influences, and gracious Assistances? Or, if at times he may suspend
the sensible quickenings, and enlargements of his Grace; yet does he not then
most intend Grace, when he seems to suspend the same? Does he not thereby
humble the soul, and bring it to a life of faith and Dependence? Is not his
withdrawment of himself, often an high act of Grace? Did not Peter receive the
more Grace, in that Grace was suspended for a season? Does Christ upbraid his
friends with old debts, or reckon with them in a legal way for infirmities? Has
he not drunk Hell dry, and left none of that salt, dead Sea for them to drink?
O study the Tendernesses of Christ toward his friends! How much it grieves
him, to see them grieved: what a bleeding sense he has of al their wounds: How
cheerfully he burdens himself with all their burdens, Heb. 4.15. How patiently
he bears with all their froward humors, morose conditions, peevish, pettish, and
murmuring frames, even as a Nurse does with her child, Act. 13.18. How much he
considers, and condescends to their Infirmities, by laying no more upon them,
than he inables them to bear; by upholding them when they fall; by performing al
manner of servile offices for them, even to the making their bed for them, in
their sicknesses, etc. Oh! what delicious, and rich matter is here for the
study, and contemplation of Christ's friends?

(3.) 3. Study the Riches of Grace in Christ.
The Friends of Christ should also much study, admire, and adore the plenitude
and Riches of his Grace. Has he not Infinite Treasures of Grace loged in him,
as Mediator? And was it not for his friends, that he received al these Immense
Treasures of Grace? Does he not also give forth, and impart these his Riches of
Grace, Freely, abundantly, universally, constantly, and unweariedly unto al,
that come unto him? Can the friends of Christ be more willing to have, than he
is to give Grace? Oh! what an increated Sun of Righteousness is here, to
illuminate dark souls? what an eternal fire is here, to heat, and melt frozen
Affections? What an Infinite Ocean is here, to water, refresh, mollify,
fructify, and satisfy dry, parched, hard, withered, and panting souls? What
strange Miracles can, and does his efficacious Grace continually work? Oh! what
a Felicity have the friends of Christ, in that their salvation is not rolled
on the wheels of their own Free will? Happy! O thrice happy are they, who have
such a rich, strong, yea, omnipotent Mediator for their friend! O if I could
yoke in amongst the thick^ of Angels and Seraphims, and now glorified Saints,
and could raise a new love-song of Christ before all the World! I am pained with
wondering at the new opened Treasures in Christ. If every finger, member, bone,
and joint were a torch burning in the hottest fire in Hell, I would they could
al send out Love-praises to that Plant of Renown, etc. Rutherfurd.
Oh! what a compassionate eye; what an healing hand; what a bleeding Heart;
what an Omnipotent Arm has he, who saves to the utmost al his Friends? Paul
tells us, Col. 1.19. For it pleased the Father, that in him should al fulness
dwell. Here is, (1.) Fulness, (2.) Al fulness, Col. 1.19.
(3.) Al fulness dwelling in Christ: which denotes the everlasting permanence of
al Grace in Christ, as in its Fountain. And that which adds a farther
excellence to this Grace, is, that it dwells in Christ, as clothed with our
Nature; and so flowing from him as such, becomes more connatural, and agreeable
to us. So that the Grace we are made partakers of, flows, not immediately from
God, simply considered, but from Christ, as God-man, one that is near akin, and
allied to us. And oh! what an admirable tincture? what an excellent perfume has
this Grace, as it issues from the heart of Christ? As waters that pass through
Minerals, receive some tincture, and relish of the Mines they pass through: so
the Grace of God passing thorough the Golden mine of God-man, receives a
tincture thereof, which renders it mighty sweet, and admirable. O study then
the excellent Qualities of this Grace, as it streams thorough the heart of
Christ God-man. Study also the Infinite Quantities of this Grace. O the
infinitude of Christ's Grace! Who can sufficiently admire the vast treasures of
Grace in Christ? O come and dive into this infinite Abyss, and Ocean of Grace!
what fresh wonders are here to be seen day by day? The more we study this
Grace, the more we shall admire it, the more we shall trust in it, the more we
shall be sensible of our infinite, and essential obligation to it. Come and see,
if there be not boundless Treasures of Grace in Christ? Who ever perished for
want of a sufficience in Christ to save him? O Study, muse on, yea, let your
thoughts be quite swallowed up, and confounded in the Contemplation, and
Admiration of these inexhaustible Treasures of Grace, that are in Christ. O
pry into this curious, Golden Arc, in which the plenitude of the Deity dwells
bodily, or personally! What pen, though dipped in the blood of the Lamb, can
write? What tongue, though bedewed with the water of life, can express? What
Heart, though of never so vast, and Angelick make, can conceive, the ineffable,
incomprehensible Riches of Grace, that are in this incomparable Mediator? O!
What vast, created emanations of Grace have, for almost six thousand years
flowed from Christ, unto his friends? and yet he still is as full of Grace as
ever, Joh. 1.16. What Evangelick matter of contemplation, and Admiration is
here for all Eternity? Is not this the Heaven of Heavens, to employ an
Eternity in the Beatifick Vision, Fruition, and Adoration of this wonder of
Heaven and Earth, the Lord of Glory; to view, and never out-view; to admire,
and never over-admire this wonder of wonders, our dear Lord? And should not the
friends of Christ be much conversant in digging into this golden Mine, in
surveying this Celestial Canaan? Alas! how little do we yet understand of
Emmanuel's Name, and Land? What a shame is it for the friends of Christ, that
there should be such admirable excellences in Christ, and they want eyes to
view them? O that al other vain Beauties, fond Loves, and Idol-friends might
wither, and die away; that so the vigor, intention, and force of our
Meditation, Admiration, and Adoration might be expended on this most Beautiful,
Affectionate, and Gracious Lord! What an Heaven would this be on Earth? What
Life in Death? How far short do they come of living up to that friendship, they
profess toward Christ, who content themselves, with commun, loose, feeble,
cheap, mean, low, and vulgar contemplations, and Estimes of him? How much does
the Claritie, and Spiritualitie of our Light; the fervor and heat of our
Affections; the vigor, Beauty, Growth, perfection, exercice, and Glory of our
Graces, depend on our Studies, Contemplations, Admirations, and Adorations of
Christ?

SECT. 2. The friends of Christ should daily Repete their first conjugal
Election of him, Col. 2.6.
2. 2. Advice to the Friends of Christ, to repete daily their first Election of
Christ.
ANother piece of Admonition, and Advice for the Friends of Christ, in order to
their living up to their professed Amity with him, is, daily to revive, and
repete their first Election of, and closure with Christ. And O that I had
Affections, Expressions; and Opportunity to press home this great piece of
Sacred Advice, on the friends of Christ! What can there be said of greater
moment, for the Preservation, The Benefits of such repeted elections of Christ.
Improvement, and Perfection of our Friendship with Christ, than this, that our
Hearts be frequently, yea, daily, and deeply engaged in this great Fundamental,
and Vital Act of Electing, and closing with Christ?

(1.) 1. As to gradual separation from sin, self, the World and Law.
Did not this solemn Election of Christ, at first, make that happy divorce
between the Heart, and Sin, with all other Christ's Enemies? And is not the
Heart daily more alienated from Sin, and Self, and the World, and the Law, by
such revived closures with Christ? Does not the prevalence, and predominance of
spiritual pride, carnal Confidence, Self-love, Earthly-mindednes, Hypocrisy,
with other spiritual lusts, arise from our defects of such renewed closures
with Christ? Be not discouraged at broken, and spilt Resolutions, but to it,
and to it again. Woo about Christ, 'til ye get your soul espoused, as a chaste
Virgin to him. Rutherf.
Is there any thing that does more effectively quench the flames of violent
passions, or break the impetuous force of unmortified Dispositions, and
irregular Inclinations, than fresh Adherences to, and Recumbences on Christ?
What more efficaciously shuts the door of the Heart, against the
Blandissements, and Inveiglements of an Heart-bewitching world, than to have it
laid open for Christ, and the election of him? Is not the Heart also, by such
fresh espousements of Christ, more powerfully rent from the Law, as a Covenant
of works? This seems to be the import of our Saviors exhortation, Mat. 7.13,
14. Mat. 7.13, 14.
Enter ye in at the strait gate, etc. i. e. Make it your daily work to bid
Adieu to al Beloved Idolfriends, which are enemies to Christ: get your Hearts,
every day more and more, stripped of, and rent from Sin, Self, the World, and the
Law as a Covenant. And how may this be accomplished, but by more continued
Election of, and Adhesion to Christ? The Strait Gate, takes in, not only
Aversion from Idol-friends, but also Conversion to Christ, our best friend: and
the daily Repetition of the latter, gives no sinal perfection to the former.
The Heart is never turned more effectually from sin, self, the world, and Law,
than when it is most firmly, and frequently turned to Christ.

(2.) 2. As to the confirmation or our union with Christ.
This repeted, and daily Election of Christ is that which Corr^borates, and
confirms the Soul's bond of Union, or Covenant of Amity with Christ. For what
is it that first knits the Heart, in a Covenant of Friendship with Christ? Is
it not the Believers Election of Christ, as his friend? And does not the
Repetition of the same Election mightily confirm, and strengthen this bond of
Union? Cant. 2.16.
Thus it was with the Spouse, Cant. 2.16. my Beloved is mine, and I am his.
Here she makes a fresh, and solemn espousement of, or conjugal Covenant with
Christ. As if she had said: He is wholly for me, and shall not I be wholly for
him, and for non other, Hos. 3.3? He has given me a large room in his Heart,
and shall not I give him a Regal Throne in mine heart? Is he content with me,
poor, sinful, unworthy me? and shall not I be content with Him, most excellent,
alsufficient, incomparable Him? Thus, by repeted election of Christ, she
strengthens her union with him. Is not the Heart hereby kept close to Christ;
and thence, Christ kept close to the Heart? Do not such repeted, frequent
Elections of Christ, bring the soul into a more intimate and firm Adhesion
unto Him; so that the Heart cannot be long absent from Christ, nor Christ long
absent from the Heart?

(3.) 3. As to the Radication of Grace.
Such reiterated, and frequent Elections of Christ, do greatly radicate, and
Strengthen the Root of Habitual Grace in the Heart. According to the mesure of
our actual Dependence on Christ, and his Impartment of Grace to us, such is the
Vigor, and Strength of Habitual Grace: Now this reiterated Election of Christ,
is that which brings the soul into the most Absolute Dependence on Christ; and
engages him to give forth the most efficacious influences of his Grace. The
more we Elect Christ, the more we depend on him: and the more we depend on him
the more we receive from him, in point of Grace. So Col 2.6. Col. 2 6, 7.
As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus, so walk ye in him, i. e. keep up
the same frame of spirit toward Christ, wherewith ye first received him: be
much in the repetition of your first election of him. A Christians
coversion-work is never at an End, 'til his life be at an end: His new birth is
never perfectly over, so long as he continues in this imperfect life: He ought
daily to enter in at the strait Gate, that so he may walk in the narrow way,
Mat. 7.13, 14. Peter had a second Conversion, after his great Relapse into that
sin of denying his Lord: And so the friends of Christ have their Second, Third,
Fourth (etc.) Conversions, as to fresh turnings from sin unto God. Can thou
remember with what frame of spirit thou first receivedst Christ? What deep
convictions, and feeling sense of sin thou had? What breaches for, and from
sin, were made on thy soul? What solemn closures with Christ thy soul made?
Why then, as thou at first did receive Christ, so walk in him: keep up the
same frame, and posture of spirit toward sin, and Christ. And what follows, V.
7. Rooted, and built up in him, and stablished in the Faith. The Radication of
Grace, and the establishment of the soul in faith depends on our walking in
Christ, as we first received him; i. e. on the fresh Election of him.

(4.) 4 As to the Enlargement of Affections.
This repeted Espousement of Christ, is that which gives us an huge enlargement
of Affections toward Christ. Oh! What strong, and raised desires after Christ?
What Intimate, and inviolable Embracements of Christ in the Arms of Love? What
Infinite Satisfaction, and Complacence in his Presence? What bitter
Lamentations, and mournings after him in his absence? What Infinite thirsts and
longings for; as also lively Hopes of his Return? And what Implacable zele
against whatever may oppose Christ, would his friends have, were they much in
this repeted Election of Christ? The Love of Espousals, and kindness of youth,
which young Converts give unto Christ, is usually most strong, and vehement, as
Jer. 2.2. I remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine
Espousals, when thou wentest after me in the Wilderness, in a Land that was not
sown. Oh! what pure, virgin, passionate, tenacious, violent, warm, melted,
efficacious Affections had Israel toward Christ, after her
Wildernes-condition, when she first made a solemn contract with, and
espousement of him, at the valley of Achor? Was she not then Holiness to the
Lord, etc. as v. 3. And what more effectually preserves such conjugal
Affections toward Christ, than the frequent Repetition of this first conjugal
contract?

(5.) 5. As to Recoveries out of backsliding.
Nothing is more effectual to recover the friends of Christ, out of their
Spiritual Relapses and Backslidings of Heart, and ways, than such fresh
espousements of Christ. This is the main of Christ's Advice to the backsliding
Church of Ephesus, Revel. 2.4, 5. Rev. 2.4, 5.
Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou have left thy first
love. Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do thy
first works. What were those first works, but the great vital, fundamental Acts
of electing Christ, and recumbence on him? And is there any thing more
effectual, for the Reduction of the backsliding soul to its first-Love, than
this Repeted election of Christ? Was not this the main essential Act, Whereby
the soul was at first implanted into Christ? And can there be any thing more
soverainly efficacious, for the Reducement of the soul, under its Departures
from Christ, than the like revived, repeted choice of him?

(6.) 6. As to communion with Christ.
A main part of our communion with Christ, consists in such frequent
Repetitions of our first choice of him. Certainly, none enjoy more of Christ,
than they who most firmly adhere to him: Now wherein consnis the souls
Adhesion to Christ, if not in such revived Elections of him? Thus in that
forenamed Text, Col. 2.6. As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus, so walk
ye in him. As if he had said: Do'nt you remember, what glorious Ideas; what
lively, and precious thoughts; what firm Adherence of will; what a torrent of
melted Affections, you had for, and toward Christ at first Conversion? Why
then, walk in the same: endeavor to keep up, and maintain the same in daily
communion with Christ.

(7.) 7. As to the life of Faith.
The choicesi part of the life of Faith, and the soul's daily expectation of
its absent Lord, consists in frequent, repeted elections of Christ. The Life of
Faith is the Life of our friendship with Christ. We never are better friends to
him, than when we believe most on him; and are daily under lively expectations
of his second coming: and (...) not this wrought by fresh election of him? No
wonder indeed, that many professed friends of Christ, live so much by sense, on
present sensible goods; seeing their Hearts are so much strangers to these great
vital Acts of Faith. Have not the friends of Christ very frequent, deep, and
lively Apprehensions of, and Affections for Christ's second coming, and coming
Glory, at first conversion? Yea, is not their faith in this particular
sometimes clearer, and stronger at first Conversion, than in some following
parts of their life? Have not many young Converts more contemtible, cheap, and
vile, estime of sensible good; with more raised, and sublime conceptions of
future Enjoyments, at first turning to Christ, than afterward? Are not
visible, present Goods, and Ils, made really invisible, and Absent; as also
Invisible, and Absent Goods, and Ils, made really visible, and present to their
eye of faith? Thus it was with those young Converts, the Thessalonians, in the
beginning of their Friendship with Christ, 1 These. 1.9, 10. where he
comprehends their first conversion under these two Heads: Ye turned to God from
Idols, (1.) To serve the living and true God. (2.) And to wait for his Son from
Heaven. So that this waiting for the second coming of Christ, which is else
where made one of the highest parts of the life of faith, these Thessalonians,
even in their first conversion, arrived unto. And whence came this to pass,
but from the Realitie, ^^^idence, and Efficacy of their Assent; conjunct with
the Force, and Firmitude of their consent, and Adherence to Christ? And O! what
firm, deep Expectations of Christ's second coming? What lively views, yea,
prelilabitions of his Coming, Invisible Glories, might the friends of Christ
arrive unto, were they but much in the exercices of these Vital Acts of Faith?

(8.) 8. As to Assurance.
Reiterated, and daily-fresh Elections of Christ have a mighty soverain
influence for the production, and conservation of Assurance. The Assurance of
our union with Christ, has an efficacious influence for the Improvement of our
friendship with him: For the knowledge of our Interest in the heart of Christ,
gives him a greater Interest in our hearts: we love Christ most, when we are
most assured of his love to us: and this is mostly got by fresh elections of
him. What a vast quantity of sincere Christians are there, who labor under
pannick fears, and vexatious douts touching their eternel state? Oh! what would
they give for a wel-grounded, firm, assurance, of a sincere friendship with
Christ? how welcome would pale-faced Death be to them, the next moment, after
their arrive unto such an Assurance? What irksome toil, and labors do they
undergo in corporal severities? How much do they pore on their hearts, to find
out any glimmering marquis, or signs of their sincerity? All this is good in
its kind, and season: But yet, let me say it, next to the broad Seal, and
actual Inspiration of the Spirit of Adoption, (who is the principal Agent)
there is, as I conceive, nothing more efficacious, either for the procurement,
or preservation of a grounded, Stable, Assurance, than repeted, and frequent
Elections of, and Recumbences on Christ. And, I verily believe, would the
douting friends of Christ, spend but half that time, which they usually spend
in unbelieving complaints, and porings on their Hearts for signs of Grace, in
such fresh and vigorous Elections of, and Adherences unto Christ, they would
far sooner arrive to their desired Haven of Assurance, than otherwise they are
like to do. For, albeit sanctification, be in it self always an Infallible
marque of Justification, yet it is not always such as to our sense: Spiritual
arguing from the Effect, to the Cause, is Orthodoxe, and sound Logic in
Christ's Schole; but yet how often do the Mists, and Clouds of an unbelieving,
scrupulous heart interpose, and hinder the conclusion from following, though
the premises be good? So great a darkness is there often upon gracious signs,
and evidences of our sincerity. But now by repeted elections of, and
Recumbences on Christ, he is engaged to give forth fresh light, and Influences,
for the discovery of our Graces. Direct Acts of Adherence to Christ, make way
for the reflexe Acts of Assurance, touching our Interest in Christ: Repeted
faith of Recumbence, at last brings faith of Assurance. There is no more
effectual course for the discovery of our faith in Christ, than by putting
forth fresh acts of faith on Christ: For as by the vital acts of life, we know
we have life: so by believing, we come to know that we do believe. Yea, faith
is not only in it self the best evidence of Grace; but also it gives light,
life, and spirit to al other evidences of Grace. yea, who are they, to whom
Christ most delights to give the Assurance of his love, but such as most
frequently love, and elect him for himself? All this is confirmed to us, by the
lively, feeling experiences of the best Saints; who usually never find Christ
nearer to them, in the evidence of his love, than when their hearts are nearest
to him, by such fiducial acts of Election, and love. I have known a Christian,
(and indeed the greatest Saint that I ever knew) who was much assaulted with a
violent Tentation, that he was but an Hypocrite; but being brought to this
Resolution, That if he had been an Hypocrite hitherto, yet now he would cast
himself upon the Grace of God in Christ; immediately the tentation vanished.
Thus we see, what a soverain Influence fresh acts of adherence to Christ have
to dispel douts, and strengthen friendship with Christ.

SECT. 3. The friends of Christ should endeavor to grow more Rooted, and Built
up in Christ, Col. 2.7.
3. 3. Advice to the friends of Christ, to grow more rooted and built up in
Christ.
HEnce follows another seasonable Admonition, and Advice for the friends of
Christ, in order to their living up to the Dignity of their Relation, and
Profession; namely, that they would labor after a frame of spirit more rooted,
and built up in Christ. This is a subsequent of the former, and so it is
brought in Col. 2.7. Paul having, Col. 2.7.
in the foregoing verse, exhorted them, to walk in Christ, by frequent election
of him, in the same manner, as they at first received him; he here subjoins:
Rooted, and built up in him, and stablished in the faith. The friends of Christ
may not content themselves in the mere Repetition of their first Acts, and
Works; but they ought to make progress therein; and grow more rooted, and
welgrounded in Christ. As if the Apostle had said; Ye cannot walk in, and with
Christ; as your friend, unless ye are deeply radicated, or rooted, and firmly
superstructed, or built upon Christ. Here is a twofold mecaphor; the one taken
from plants, wel-radicated; the other from Edifices, or Houses welgrounded. He
teaches us therefore, that Christ is our Root, in which we ought to be daily
more firmly radicated: and our Foundation, on which we ought to be continually
more firmly edificated, or built. The first notion (...), is rendered by
Erasmus, So as you may have roots fixed in Christ: as for the other word (...),
it being a participle of the present Tense, it shows that this superstruction
is successive, and gradual, as Ephesians. 2.21. In sum; the Spirit, and mind of
this Advice is, that the Friends of Christ would Endeavor after a Soliditie,
firmitude, depth, and strength in the great fundamental, and vital acts of
Faith. So it follows: and stablished in the faith: Idem absque figura repetit
quod per Translationes dixerat. Calv. in loc.
whereby he nakedly, and without a Figure expresses, what he had before
wrapped up in the two Metaphors, of being rooted, and built up in Christ. Now
the great Fundamental, and vital Acts of Faith in Christ, wherein the Friends
of Christ should endeavor to be more deeply radicated, or rooted, and built up,
are these:

(1.) 1. A solid and firm Assent to, and Estime of Christ.
The Friends of Christ must labor after a greater Soliditie, and depth, as also
Firmitude, and Strength of Assent to, and Estimation of Christ, as their
Friend. The more deeply radicated, solid, and firm our Assent to, and estime
of Christ, as our friend is, the more shall we Live, and Walk, and Act,
according to the Laws of Friendship with him: A superficial, feeble Assent to,
or commun and cheap estime of Christ, argues a very slender, and narrow, if any
degree of sincere Amity with Christ. This proves the ruin of a world of
pretended friendship to Christ, that it wants this due soliditie, Firmitude,
depth, and vigor of Assent, and Estime. And, without al peradventure, the more
the friends of Christ are radicated, and wel-grounded herein, the more they will
grow up to flourishing Trees, and beautiful Structures of Amity with Christ.

(2.) 2. A strong and resolute Adherence to Christ.
Another Radical, Fundamental, and Vital part of Faith, wherein the friends of
Christ should endeavor after more soliditie, depth, and Firmitude, is cordial
Adhesion to Christ, as their friend. The friends of Christ should labor after a
peremtorie, resolute, yea Headstrong Bent of will, in adherence to Christ. The
more tenacious, violent, and strong the will is, in adhering to Christ, the
better, and more durable is its friendship with him. This was the main of
Barnabas's advice to the young Christians at Antioch, Act. 11.23.
Act. 11.23. And he exhorted them al, that with purpose of Heart they would
cleave unto the Lord. Barnabas was much rejoiced to see their young, and green
Amity toward Christ: ay, but he would fain have them more solid, and firm;
more deeply radicated in their Adherence to Christ: (...), with purpose of
Heart, i. e. with a more peremtorie, resolute, determined, fixed will; an heart
more strongly bent, more firmly and inviolably knit to Christ; a will more
firmly determined for Christ, but more undetermined for sin, and self, an
Heart more and more resolved for Christ, but more and more unresolved for other
Lovers; a will more bent for Christ, but more unbent for Idol-friends. So much
also is contained in the following notion, (...), to adhere, or cleave to the
Lord, as the needle to the Loadstone; as the Wife to her Husband; as the Body
to the soul. This firm, solid, and deep Adherence of the will to Christ is well
expressed, Ps. 73.26.
Psalm 73.26. my flesh and mine Heart fails, but God is the strength of mine
Heart: (...), my rock; He to whom mine heart adheres, as a drowning man to his
rock. Or we may read it, with R. Ezra, thus: the firm Adhesion of mine Heart
is to God. Hold fast Christ, contend for him: it is a lawful plea to go to
holding for Christ. Rutherf.
As if he had said; I am well nigh immersed, and quite swallowed up in the Ocean
of Tentations; but yet the firm Adherence, or rational Bent of mine Heart is
to Christ: here I am resolved to adhere, and stick, come what will. And why?
because he is my portion for ever, as it follows. Christ loves a peremtorie,
resolved will; such as cannot part with him for the greatest good, or refuse
him, though attended with the greatest suffering. A Reverend and holy Divine of
this Age, gives us a great experiment of this tenacious, peremtorie Adherence
to Christ. 'Sin, says he, has made us as tender, as if we were made of Paper,
or Glass: I am often thinking, what I would think of Christ, and burning quick
together; of Christ and torturing, and hot melted Lead poured in at mouth, and
navel: Yet I have some weak experience, that suppose Christ, and Hel's torments
were married together, and if therewere no finding of Christ at al, except I
went to Hel's furnace, that there, and in no other place, I could meet with
him. I trow, if I were, as I have been since I was his prisoner, I would beg
loging, for God's sake, in Hel's hottest Furnace, that I might rub souls with
Christ.' Such a determined, peremtorie, and resolute will, and Adherence unto
Christ, is that which gives a mighty Spirit, Vigor, Beauty, Life, Growth,
Exercice, and perfection to our Amity with Christ. And, on the contrary, the
more faint, languid, superficial, and undetermined our will is, in its Adherence
to Christ, the more danger it is in of partial, if not of total, and final,
backsliding from him; especially in times of Tentation. Remember, so far as
your Hearts are undetermined, and unresolved for Christ; so far they are
determined, and resolved against him, for sin, and the world, and any other
Idol-friends.

(3.) 3. Resignation to, and Recumbence on Christ.
The last radical, and fundamental part of Faith consists, in a cheerful, and
complete Resignation of al concerns to Christ; with entire Recumbence, and
Dependence on him, for Influence and Assistance, in order to the performance of
al Duties, and Offices, both Active and Passive, incumbent on the friends of
Christ. And the more soliditie and depth, the more Firmitude and Strength the
friends of Christ gain, in these Fundamental, Radical, and vital Acts of
Resignation to, and Recumbence, or Dependence on Christ, the more will they
live, and walk up to those Laws, and Duties of friendship, they owe to Christ.

What more agreeable to the Notion, Resignation of al to Christ.
and Relation of a friend, than Absolute Resignation of al concerns, into the
hands of our friend? Are any reputed better confidents, or more intimate
friends, than they, who can most absolutely Recumb, and Depend on us for
Advice, Conduct, and Assistance in their most important Affairs? There is such
an intimate, and essential connection betwixt confidence, and Amity, as that
the terms are frequently used interchangably each for other: For a confident,
and Friend are used as terms Equivalent. And assuredly, nothing more directly
conduces to the Strength, Improvement, and Exercice of friendship with Christ,
than confidence in him, both in regard of Resignation to, and Recumbence on
him, in all the momentous Affairs of our Life. Such was the Spirit of Abraham's
Amity with Christ, in the Relinquishment of Chaldea, and Resignation of his
only Son Isaac; which were two Heroic pieces of confidence in, and Friendship
with Christ, James 2.23. What is Friendship, but to make our friends Wisdom,
Will, Interest, and Force ours? O blessed he, that can Sacrifice his own Wit,
Will, Strength and Designs, by a complete Resignation of al to Christ! The Will
of Christ's friend must be as that of a servant; who is then best, when he
retains the least of his own will, and most of his Master's. O! what an happy
thing is it to be quite stripped, and spoiled of every rag of self; that so
Christ may stand in the room of self? The friends of Christ should subscribe a
blank Resignation, and put it into the hands of Christ: They must take al Laws
from him, but give none to him: He must be Absolute King over their Persons,
Wills, Interests, etc.

And so for Dependence on Christ for Assistance, Dependence on Christ for Grace.
and Influence, it must be Absolute, Immediate, Total, and Constant. The
friends of Christ never attain to higher raisures of friendship with Christ,
than when, by faith, they most eye, and depend on that Grace, that dwells in
him. For according to the mesure of our Dependence on Christ for Grace, such is
usually the mesure of his communications to us. Why was it, that Christ
received such an infinite plenitude of Grace? Was it for himself? or, was it
not rather for his friends, that want it most? And who are they, that find
Christ nearest to them, in the quickening, enlarging, fructifying,
corroborating, and supporting Influences of his Grace; but his fainting
friends; such as have the most Actual, Immediate, and Absolute Dependence on
his Grace, as Esa. 40.29, 30, 31? And why is it, that Christ keeps many of his
dear friends, under great spiritual Desertions, Barrennesses, Languishments,
Deadnesses, and Abatements of first love? Is not this the main cause of al,
that hereby they may be taken off more fully, from their own self-dependences,
and so be brought to a more complete Dependence on Christ for all Grace, both
Actual, and Habitual? Yea, are not the most eminent friends of Christ,
sometimes foiled in their most eminent Graces, and that by a small Tentation,
when they depend on their own Graces, and neglect their Dependence on Christ?
And on the contrary, are not fainting, and weak Christians, by virtue of their
Dependence on Christ, often very strong, and impregnable, under the most violent
Tentations? Certainly, the friend of Christ is but a poor passive, dependent
thing; he has no spiritual wings to fly, no legs to go, no, hands to work, no
breath to pray, no food to eat, no fire to warm him, but what he receives from
Christ: his Graces are but creatures, and therefore cannot preserve themselves;
or act, farther than they are acted by Christ. Thus the Friends of Christ must
live wholly in Christ, in a way of Resignation, and Dependence, and then he will
live wholly in them, by gracious Influences, and communications; the more deep,
and rooted their Faith, and confidence in Christ is, the more green, and
flourishing will their Amity with him be. The best bargain they can make, is to
sell themselves, without Reversion, unto Christ: for hereby they come to have,
and enjoy, a more Noble, Laudable, Ample, and Free self in Christ.

SECT. 4. The Friends of Christ should reserve for him their spiritually
conjugal, choicest, and best Affections.
4. 4. Advice for Christ's friends to loge him in their choicest Affections.
ANother Admonition, and Advice to the friends of Christ, is, that they would
entertain, and loge Christ in their choicest and best Affections. Affection
mixed with prudence, and Fidelity, is the Spirit, and Soul of Friendship. And
the more rational, spiritual, pure, and Efficacious our Affections are; the
more solid, refined, permanent, and influential will our Friendship be. Such
therefore as will live up, and fulfill to the Dignity of their professed Amity
with Christ, must labor after the most refined, and elevated Affections, that
may be, for him. Oh! what pity is it, that whorish Lovers, and Idol-friends
should share in that conjugal Affection, which is due to Christ? Alas! what
folly is it, to divide that little narrow piece of Love, which is not enough
for the best beloved Christ, among bastard Lovers; which are so far from giving
satisfaction, as that the more we embrace them, the more they sting us? Christ
expects nothing from us, more than our Love, and nothing less will he accept.
As Christ gives his friends a conjugal pledge, namely the Earnest of his
Spirit; so he expects from them a conjugal Love. Mariage-love is indivisible,
it will not serve for two corrivals: Christ must loge his alone there. He that
enters into a covenant of conjugal Amity with Christ, must bid Adieu to al
other Lovers: Christ will have Integrity, and Honesty or nothing: And
therefore usually he Wooes, and Elects his friends in the furnace of
Affliction; he allures them into a Wilderness of many Difficulties, Tentations,
and Desertions, there to win, and gain their Affections entirely to himself, as
Hos. 2.14, 15. The Friends of Christ are not, neither can they be Masters of
two predominant Loves; and therefore Christ must be their Althings, or he is
nothing to them. Alas! how little do the friends of Christ owe to the
flattering, or frowning World? Is not a good look too much for Idol-friends,
who would take up Christ's room, in our Affections, over his Head? Woe, woe to
him, who has such a friend as Christ is, and yet wants Affection for him! Can
our Affections sleep securely, or find satisfaction any where, but in Christ's
bosom? What gain we by spending our Affection's on this smoking World, but
vapors, and sick dreams, instead of ease, and content? Fie, fie, that whorish
Idols should possess our conjugal Affection, due to so good a friend as Christ
is! Oh! what curs^^ Affection is that, which streameth toward any other Lover
but Christ? How much should the friends of Christ disdain, that any thing but
their Lord, should touch their spiritual conjugal Affections? What an holy
Ambition should they have, of entertaining Christ, and none but Christ, in
their choicest Affections? How greatly should they scorn al secret dalliances,
with an Adulterous World? But to descend to particulars.

(1.) 1. Conjugal Love to Christ.
The first and main Affection, which the Friends of Christ should entertain him
with, is a conjugal love. Love, as it fulfils the Law, so also Amity with
Christ. And the more Discrete, Solid, Spiritual, Virgin, Equal, Intimate,
Passionate, Commensurate, and Transformative our Love to Christ is; the more
Raised, Wel-grounded, Conjugal, Permanent, Noble, and Operative will our
friendship with Christ be. The Friends of Christ ought to cast their choicest
Love into no mould, but Christ's; that so it may be for him, and for none
other. Thus the Spouse, Cant. 2.7. My Love. Pathetically: Cant. 2.7.
as if she had said, him on whom al my conjugal love centers; the delight of
mine eyes, the joy of mine heart, the Ocean, into which al my little love
streams; mine only Love. So much is implied: for Abstracts speak Forms, and
Essences. The friends of Christ must give him their virgin Love; the Elixir,
Essences, and Spirits of their Love. A green, young love may not suffice for
Christ: he must have the flour, and vigor of our Love. That little narrow spark
of Divine Love, which was inspired, and breathed by Christ, into the Hearts of
his Friends, must respire or breath forth, live, and inhabit no where, but in
the bosom of Christ. Alas! where should the stream emtie it self, but in the
Ocean, whence it received its first emanation? Oh! what pity is it, that so
much of our Love should pass by Christ, and terminate on Idol-lovers? Who is
the Proprietor of our Love, but Christ, and Christ alone? where is there an
object adequate to the Saints love, but Christ? where are there such ravishing
Beauties, such delicious Suavities, such surpassing excellences, such
Transcendent glories, to feed our Love with all, as in Christ? Can we then put
our conjugal-love into better hands than Christ's? Is it not natural to love,
to spend its choicest spirits, and vigor on the fairest, and most amiable
object? Is it not sad, that Christ should have so much Beauty, Sweetness,
Excellence for his friends; and yet they should have so little Love for him?
Alas! Alas! that clay-Gods, that Time-Idols, that beautiful shadows, and gilded
Nothings should run away with so much of our love, and so little of it be
reserved for Christ. Oh! what folly is it to have an oblique, and squint-regard
to skin-deep Beauties, and golden dreams, when as there is such substantial
Amiablenes in Christ? O the prodigious madness of those, who find love for
pleasing toys, for beautiful vanities, for fai^ nothings; and yet can find no
love for Christ, the best beloved! Certainly, a little creature-love is enough,
or too much, but much, yea, the most Christ-love is too little for the friends
of Christ, who have espoused him for their Husband. What is Heaven, if this be
not Heaven, to lie under the beatifick vision, Love, and Fruition of Christ?
And who enjoy more of Heaven upon earth, than such whose hearts are most
transformed into, and ravished with the fiducial Contemplation, Admiration, and
Love of Christ? Spiritual, pure, and passionate Love to Christ, gives the
friends of Christ a possession of himself; yea a secret, and efficacious
Transformation into the Image of Christ. For the Heart silently steals into,
and becomes one with, what it strongly loves. Love the world greatly, and thine
heart will soon become worldly: Love Christ greatly, and thine heart will grow
up, and be gradually transformed into the Image of Christ-Such a Soverain, and
Efformative virtue has Love, especially that of Friendship, if it be in any
eminent, predominant degree. O then Love, Love, Love Christ much!

(2.) 2. Desires after Christ.
Another Affection, which the friends of Christ ought to be much in the
exercice of toward Christ, is conjugal desire after him. I^ om^i diligente
causatur desideri^m ut u^iatur suo dilecto ia quantum possib^le est Aquin.
Contra Gent. l. 3. c. 153.
Desire is the firstborn of Love; the feet of the soul, whereby it goes forth
to meet its beloved. And, undoutedly, none live, and aci more as friends of
Christ, than such as are possessed with the strongest desires after him. O! how
pleasing is it to Christ, to see his friends full of lovesick desires, and
longings after himself? Christ cannot be long absent from such as are sick at
heart, and pained with desires after him. Thus it was with the lovesick
Spouse, Can. 2.5, 6.
Cant. 2.5. O what would I give to have a bed made to my wearied soul in
Christ's bosom! I would frist Heaven for many years, to have my fill of Jesus
in this life. I cannot tell you what sweet pain, and delightsome torments are in
Christ's love, etc. Rutherf. L.
For I am sick of love; and what follows? V. 6. His left hand is under mine
Head, and his right hand embraccth me. She no sooner longs for him, but feels
his embracements; yea, he longs for her, as much, or infinitely more, than she
longs for him. Oh! what a pleasing pain is it, to be pained with desires after
Christ? what a sweet, living death is it, to die with longings after him? O!
what monstrous unkindnes is it, that Christ should long after his friends, and
yet they not long after him? O hunger and thirst after Christ! hunger after his
Grace, thirst after Christ's Love, and the sense of it; hunger after his
person; yea, hunger and thirst after Spiritual hunger, and thirst after Christ:
there is a young Heaven in Hunger, and Thirst after Christ. None enjoy more of
Christ, at least of his spiritual and gracious presence, than such as have most
infinite thirsts, and longings of soul after him. Get as near Christ as thou
may, by thy Desires: if they cannot run, let them creep toward Christ:
never leave, 'til thine Heart be chained, and fettered to Christ by desires, if
not by more sensible Fruition. Thus it was with the Spouse, Cant. 3.3. Cant.
3.3. Him.
Saw ye him whom my soul loveth] Saw ye Him? There is a great Emphase, and
Efficace in this manner of speech: Vis max ima est in co dicendi genere: nam
Relativum fine Antecedente est maxim Emphaticum. Sanctius. in loc.
Here is a Relative [Him] without an Antecedent; which argues the force and
Stength of her desires: She thought all the World knew whom she meant, and
desired after: her desires are so ardent, as that they will not permit her to
express his Name: all that she can say, is, Saw ye Him? etc. Him; what Him does
she mean? Must the Watchmen needs understand her broken language? Yes; her
desires were so pressing, as that she had not leisure to say more than this,
saw ye him, whom my soul loves? The like affectionate desires after Christ, we
find in Marie, Joh 20.15. Sir, If thou hastborne him hence, Joh. 20.15.
tell me where thou have laid him, and I will take him away. Here is nothing but
Him, and Him, and Him: her desires after Christ were so vehement, as that she
had not time to express whom she meant: she says, tell me where thou have laid
him, and I will take him away. Alas poor woman, the strength of her desires made
her excede the bounds of rational discourse. Surely, nothing that is duty
seems impossible, or burdensome to affectionate desires after Christ. The
stronger our desires after Christ are, the Stronger, and more invincible will
our Amity with him be.

(3.) 3. Grief for Christ's Absence.
Again, the friends of Christ should labor after a more conjugal grief for, and
bitter sense of Christ's Absence; especially for, and of sin the cause thereof.
The friends of Christ, when they have not the sweet sense of a felt, and
enjoyed Christ, they ought to have the bitter sense of an Absent, displeased
Christ. A true conjugal friend of Christ knows no wounds, no pains, no
torments, like those of an angry, withdrawn Christ: To love Christ and to want
him wants little of Hell. Ruth.
Death, and Hell to him consists in separation, and distance from Christ: The
sense of loss to him is worse than the sense of pain: Yea, it is his greatest
pain, that he has lost his best friend: he sees all the curses, and Plagues of
God wrapped up in the loss of Christ. Cant. 5.6.
So it was with the Spouse, Cant. 5.6. I opened to my beloved, but my beloved
had withdrawn himself, and was gone: my soul failed when he spoke, etc. My soul
failed: Christ's Parting farewell put his Spouse into a fainting, swooning,
dying fit: Her heart was gone, when her Lord was gone: when he left her, she
left her self: her spirits evaporated. Oh! what languishments; what swoonings,
and failures of spirits, should the friends of Christ have, when he bids Adieu
to them; especially, if their sin be the cause of his Departure from them?
Should they not be greatly afflicted in Spirit, that Christ's withdrawment from
them, was occasioned by the withdrawment of their Hearts from Christ? What
should wound, and grieve them, if not this, that they have wounded, and grieved
their best friend, and so made him, at least seemingly, to turn against them
as an enemy? Can there be a worse Hell, on this side Hell, to the friends of
Christ, than this, that their departure from Christ, has made him depart from
them, and leave them under a wildernes-condition of many Tentations,
Desertions, Difficulties, etc? O mourn, mourn, for Christ's Absence, and for
sin, the cause thereof, as the worst Hell.

(4.) 4. Lively Hopes of Christ's Return.
As the friends of Christ should maintain a deep, bitter sense of, and grief
for Christ's Absence, so ought they, no less, to keep up a wel-grounded lively
Hope of his Return. Hope is, according to the Scripture style, the Anchor of
the soul, Heb. 6.19. if this fail, Heb. 6.19.
how soon will the Heart fail, and sink down into the Gulf of despair. In times
of Desertion Satan, and our own unbelieving Hearts make many black lies, and
raise many slanders on Christ; therefore if Hope dies, al dies. Wel-grounded
Hope is a seed of Heaven: it is a good Prophet, which always Prophecies glad
tidings of Christ's Return. Yea, take a friend of Christ in his lowest ebb of
comfort, and darkest mist of Desertion, and Tentation, yet even then he has
some insensible, negative Hopes; so that he dares not say peremtorily, Christ
will never return: or, if he say it, it is but in a fit of Unbelief; and
therefore he soon recollects himself again, and cannot but cherish some secret
hopes; which, though not perceptible, or sensible, yet he will not part with
them for a thousand worlds. Thus it was with Jonah, chapter 2. v. 4. Though I said,
Jonah^ 2.4.
I am cast out of thy sight, yet I will look toward thine holy Temple. Jonah,
in the Whales belly, cast a wist eye of Hope toward the Temple, the Symbol of
Christ, which kept up his soul from sinking, when his body was sunk unto the
bottom of the Sea. Thence says David, Ps. 119.81.
Psalm. 119.81. my soul faints for thy salvation; but I hope in thy word. He
had long expected salvation, and should have given up al for lost, had he not
hoped in God's word of Promise: Christ breathes in a word of Promise into his
Heart, and he breaths forth fresh, and lively hopes every day into Christ's
bosom. The friends of Christ must remember, that the Cable to which the Anchor
of their Hope is fastened, is not their own mutable, ambulatorie will, or the
fallible word of men, but the immutable Oath, and infallible word of the
eternal God; who is Veracitie it self, Heb. 6.17, 18. Oh! what a strong
Foundation, what an immobile Rock is here, for our Hopes to anchor on? How may
our Hopes leap, and dance on this rock, and bid defiance to Hell it self?
Satan's main work is to role the friends of Christ off this their rock; and
their main business is, to cast the Anchor of their Hope daily on Christ, the
Rock of Ages. And this is matter of eternal encouragement to the real friends
of Christ, that albeit their Hopes are faint, feeble, and variable; yet the
Foundation, on which they anchor, is strong and immutable: whereas the false
friend of Christ may have strong hopes, or rather presumtions; yet he has only
a variable, fleeting, sandy foundation, namely, his own foolish heart, and
carnal confidences.

(5.) 5. Joy, and Complacence in Christ.
Another Affection, wherewith the friends of Christ ought to entertain him, is
Joy, complacence, and delight. When Christ infuseth himself into the hearts of
his friends, and gives them any taste of his satisfying sweetnesses, and
excellences; how should they yield up themselves to Christ, yea lose themselves
in him? Est amicitiae proprium, qu^d al^quis in praesentia amici delectetur,
and in eo consolationem contra omnes anxietates inveniat. Aquin. Gent. contra
l. 4. c. 24.
Is it not a propriety of friendship, that a man solace himself in the
presence of his friend; and find consolation in him against al Anxieties?
Hence, is it not the custom, for men under al their griefs, and discomfitures,
to have recourse unto their friends for comfort? Thus the friends of Christ
must make his presence the Spring, and Matter of their Consolation and Joy: As
nothing should be so bitter to them, as Christ's departure; so nothing so
sweet, and joyous as his Return. As Christ's Absence makes up their Hell, so
his presence must make up the Heaven of his friends. Christ will not, cannot
have his abode long in that heart, where any Idol-friend is more prised than
himself. Christ is the Element, wherein his friends ought to live, and breath,
and bath themselves, in soul-satisfying delights. Christ is such a Regal
friend, as that he expects a Throne al alone, in the complacence of his
friends: He allows them to spend some loose Affections on Inferior friends,
provided that they reserve their highest complacence, and delight for himself,
their best beloved. This must be made over, without Reversion and Reserve, to
Christ. Cant. 2.3.
Thus the Spouse, Cant. 2.3. I sat down under his shadow with great delight;
and his fruit was sweet to my taste. She soon tasted the sweetness, and felt the
ravishing delights of a present, embraced Christ. Thence it follows, v. 4. He
brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was love.

(6.) 6. Godly Fear.
The friends of Christ should labor after as great a mesure, as may be, of Holy
Fear toward Christ: their joy in Christ's presence ought to be mixed with
Godly fear, and holy Tremblement of heart, lest Christ should be displeased. We
find these two, seemingly opposite, Affections in conjunction, Psalm. 2.11.
serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling. This is an excellent
combination, when spiritual joy, and Godly fear are joined together. Oh! what a
lively character of sincere friendship is this, when the heart is filled with
Raptures of Joy in Christ's presence, and yet, at the very same time, under an
holy Tremblement, and fear of displeasing Christ, or doing any thing unworthy
of friendship with him? This seems implied in that Evangelick promise touching
backsliding Israel, Hos. 3.5.
Hos. 3.5. And shall fear the Lord and his Goodness, in the latter days. The
false friends of Christ are said to fear the Lord and his Lions, or Judgments;
but to fear the Lord and his goodness, or mercies, this is peculiar to the real
friend of Christ; who has never greater Tremblements of heart, godly fear, and
self-jelousie lest he should displease Christ, than when he lies under the most
warm beams, and Influences of Christ's presence. This is a Mystery that false
friends are not skilled in.

(7.) 7. Zele for Christ.
The Friends of Christ should Endeavor after a burning, flaming zele for
Christ. Zele, in its largest notion, is but the Fermentation, Ebullition, or
boiling up of all the Affections: But in its strict sense, it imports a
Spiritual Fervor, or heat of Affection, against whatever may oppose any desired
Good. As to our present case, conjugal zele for Christ, implies a fervent,
boiling Indignation against whatever may oppose the Name, Honor, Interest,
Glory, and Exaltation of Christ. The friends of Christ ought to burn with a
masculine zele for all the concerns of their Lord. Thus it was with David,
Psalm. 119.139. My zele, Psalm. 119.139, 158.
has consumed me, because mine enemies have forgotten thy words.] Consumed me,
or quite drunk up my spirits, eaten up my bowels, dispirited my Soul. So
flaming was his zele. The like v. 158. I beheld the Transgressors, and was
grieved: because they kept not thy word] and was grieved. (...) tedio afficit.
(...) signifies, was wearied, burdened, or tired out. Nothing was so
burdensome, tiresome, and irksome to David's spirit, as to see profane sinners
live in professed disobedience to God's Word: Such an heroic zele possessed
his Heart. Such a generous Zele should all the friends of Christ labor after.

SECT. 5. The Friends of Christ must endeavor after a greater Latitude of
interne Uniformitie with, and externe Conformity unto Christ.
5. 5. Advice for an Uniformitie with, and Conformity to Christ.
THE friends of Christ should endeavor after the greatst Uniformity with, and
Conformity to Christ, that may be. This is another great Admonition, and
Advice for Christ's friends, in order to their living up to their Dignity, and
Relation. Omnes effectus tunc maxim perfecti suni, quando maxim similantur
Causae. Aquin. contra Gent. l. 2. c. 46.
Wherein consists the perfection of an Intelligent creature, but in Divine
Assimilation to, or Ressemblance of Christ his Creator? Are not al effects then
most perfect, when they most ressemble their First Cause? And surely the more
perfect Christ's friends are, and the more like to him, the better friends they
will approve themselves. Again, al friendship imports some kind of Union, or
Unity in Ends, and designs: Now there can be no real union, or unity in one
commun end, unless there be Union, Unity, or Uniformity of wills, and
actions: Amicorum proprium est iaem Velle and nolle. Aqu. contra Gent. l. 3. c.
151.
It is the proper character of friends, to Will, and Nil, to rejoice and grieve
in the same things. A singularity of Wills, and conformity of Actions, gives
much perfection to friendship. Al friendship requires some degree of interne
Uniformity, as also externe Conformity: and the more Uniform, and Conform
friends are, in what is good, the better will their friendship be. Difformitie,
and dissimilitude in Spirits, or Actions, is that which makes a great breach on
Amity. For all Friendship is founded in similitude or likeness: and the more
like men are in virtuous Qualities, the better friends they make. I interpose
virtuous Qualities, as the foundation of this similitude, and friendship;
because there is no genuine similitude or friendship, but what has its rise
from Virtue. Al vicious persons are difforme, and dissonant, not only from
virtuous men, but also among themselves. Sin is but a Chaos, or mass of
Confusion, difformitie, and disagreement: al lusts are irregular, turbulent,
factious, dissonant, and jarring among themselves, as well as with Virtues.
Therefore vicious men, whatever their pretensions may be, can never attain to
any sincere, solid Amity; because they can never have any virtuous
Uniformity, or Ressemblance. It is the serious, virtuous person only, that may
lay claim to true Uniformity, and friendship, as Plato, and other Philosophers
have, long since, determined. Now then, this being the true Idea of al Amity,
whether Divine or human, that it be founded on some virtuous Uniformity, and
Conformity; hence it necessarily follows, that the more Uniform with, and
Conform to Christ his friends are, the more they live, and walk, and Act up to
the Dignity of their Relation to him, as friends.

(1.) 1. Interne Uniformitie with Christ.
The friends of Christ should labor after the nearest interne Uniformity with
Christ: their Spirits should rise up to the highest Ressemblance of Christ:
They should endeavor to have the Image of Christ drawn in more lively
characters on their hearts. Undoutedly, the more the friends of Christ
participate with him in the Divine Nature, 2 Pet. 1.4. the more lively
Impresses, and Stampes of his Image they receive upon their souls, the better
friends they are. Thus much is contained in that excellent Admonition and
Advice of Paul, Romans 12.1, 2.
Romans 12.1, 2. v. 1. he exhorts them, to present their bodies, (or whole
persons) a living Sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, etc. i e. to approve
themselves, what they professed, real, and loyal friends of Christ. But how
might they attain to this? That he expresses, v. 2. And be not conformed unto
this world [ i. e. Let not your hearts be shaped, molded, or formed according
to the Humors, lusts, fashions, or any other deceitful Ideas of this world] but
be ye transformed by the renewing of your minds [ i. e. Let your minds be
stripped of their old corrupt Form, received from the first Adam, and be clothed
with the new Divine Form, or Image of Christ, the second Adam, as Ephesians. 4.22,
23. whence it follows,] that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable,
and perfect will of God, i. e. that ye may approve your selves Loyal friends of
Christ. The more the friends of Christ are transformed, by the renewing of
their minds, into the Image of Christ, the more they will come to have one and
the same Mind, and Spirit with Christ; the more they will mind, affect, and
delight in, what Christ minds, affects, and delights in most. Does not the poor
Eadem velle ac eadem nolle, ea demum vera Amicitia.
Heathen teach us, that this is true friendship, to will and nil the same
things? What makes men better friends than an Unity, or Similitude of Wills?
Must not then the friends of Christ, Study, and affect a similitude, yea,
Unity of Will with Christ? What makes a greater Schism on friendship with
Christ, than Plurality of Wills? Identitie, or Samenes of Will with Christ,
prevents a world of sin, and is the Life of Grace. A friend of Christ should
have his will broken to pieces, that it may be made one With the Will of Christ;
to mind and intend the same things with Christ. Yea, is not this one of the
highest degrees of true Amity with Christ? Does Christ mind, and intend the
Glory of his Father most? And shall not the friends of Christ endeavor after
the same mind with Christ herein? O what Strong Intention, what pure aims,
should they have at the Glory of God? How should all the concerns of self, be
quite melted into, and swallowed up in the Concerns of God, and his Glory?
Again, does Christ Love and Affect Grace, more than the whole Creation besides?
And shall not the friends of Christ love and affect Grace, more than al things
else? Farther, does Christ delight in nothing so much as in doing, and
suffering his Father's Will? Was it his meat and drink to do, and suffer the
same? O then! how much should the friends of Christ delight in doing, and
suffering God's will? What complacence should they take in Active, and Passive
obedience? Thus the friends of Christ should study, and affect a greater
Latitude of interne Uniformity with Christ, in Mind, Will, and Affection. And,
without al peradventure, the more they partake of one and the same Divine
Nature and heart with Christ, the more faithful, and complete friends are they.

(2.) 2. Externe Conformity to Christ.
The friends of Christ must study and endeavor, not only Interne Uniformity
with, but also externe Conformity to Christ: They must not only mind, and
affect, but also Talk, and Act, and Live as Christ. True friendship, even among
men, requires not only Habitual, and inward Ressemblance in Nature,
dispositions, Principles, and Affections; but also actual, and outward
Conformity in Conversation, and Actions: So here, Divine Amity with Christ,
implies, not only interne, habitual Assimilation to him; but also externe,
actual Imitation of him: and the greater Latitude of degrees the friends of
Christ attain herein, the more real, and visible, yea glorious, will their
Amity appear to be. This was Paul's greatest Ambition to be an Imi^ator of
Christ; which he commends also to the Corinthians, 1 Cor. 11.1.
1 Cor. 11.1. Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ. So Ephesians.
5.1. Be ye therefore followers of God, Ephesians. 5.1.
as dear Children. It is the Ambition of pious Children to imitate their
Parents, in what is good: As they partake with them, in one and the same
Nature, and likeness; so would they fain conform to them, by one and the same
Actions, and Mode of life. Parents Exemples, are usually more forcible and
binding, than their precepts to their Children. And this arises from that
natural friendship or Uniformity of Nature, which is betwixt Parents and
Children. Such should the Exemple of Christ be to his Children, and friends by
Grace: as they have his Divine Nature communicated to them, and thereby an
Uniformity of Spirits; so also should they study, and affect, a conformity
to, or Imitation of him in all their Actions, and Conversation. Did Christ break
through al Tentations and Difficulties, to do, and suffer his Father's Pleasure?
Should not then his friends, arm themselves with the same mind, in doing and
suffering the will of God? Is it not greatly unbecoming a friend of Christ, to
be thrust off from a duty, either by the Frowns, or Smiles of this lower
world? Was David, that Noble friend of Christ, scoffed off from his duty by
Michal? Does he not rather gain courage by all her scoffs; and cry out, if
this be to be vile, I will be more vile yet? True friendship gains force, and
strength by opposition: the more its Conformity to Christ is opposed, the more
zealous and active is it therein. Again, Did Christ take upon him the Form of a
Servant, humble himself, and become obedient even to the Death? O then! how
lowly, how humbly, how self-abasedly should the friends of Christ walk? Phil.
2.5.
This is well improved by Paul, Phil. 2.5, 6, 7, 8. Having v. 3, 4. Exhorted
them to Humility and Self-denial; he brings Christ's Humility, and
Self-denial, as a copy and pattern, v. 5. Let this mind be in you, which was
also in Christ Jesus, etc. As if he had said; was Christ so humble? And is it
not a shame, that Christians, who profess friendship with him, should be so
stately, so proud? It is a good observation of Divines, that Christ's Human
Nature, though clothed with so much Glory, is the humblest Creature that ever
was. O then! what a prodigious thing is it, that our black Natures, which are
clothed with so much Deformity, and stuffed out with so much Malignitie, and
Venom of sin, should be so proud as they are? Think on this, and ever more
abhor pride. So for the other parts of Christian Conversation, the Exemple of
Christ should be the Soverain Motive, as also an Universal Idea, and Copy of
his friends Imitation. Would the friends of Christ, when they are about any
irregular undertakement, consider, Would Christ, if he were on earth, do so,
and so? Is this becoming the Dignity of that Amity I profess toward Christ?
Will this please my Lord? Do I herein imitate that Copy, and pattern, he has
set me? I say, would the friends of Christ, thus reason, and argue themselves
into an Imitation of, and Conformity to Christ; how harmonious, beautiful,
visible, flourishing and efficacious would their friendship be? But ah! alas!
how far short of Conformity to, and Imitation of the Life of Christ, that
Admirable, and most glorious miroir of Sanctity, do many professed friends of
Christ come? Yea, have not the best of Christ's friends great cause to be daily
humbled, and ashamed of their defects, as to this piece of Divine Conformity?

SECT. 6. The friends of Christ should aspire after more intimate Union, and
Communion with Christ, in all Ordinances, Duties, Providential occurrences, and
creature-Injoyments.
6. 6. Advice for Union and Communion with Christ.
THE Friends of Christ should aspire after, and contend for a more intimatt,
deep Union, and Communion with Christ, in all Ordinances, Duties, providential
Occurrences, and Creature-injoyments. This Admonition, and Advice is of grand
moment, in order to the fulfilling, and living up to the Relation and Dignity
of friendship with Christ. For all friendship implies union, and communion: and
by how much the more strict, spiritual, and deep, this union, and communion is;
by so much the more perfect will the friendship be. Where God implants a
gracious Sympathy, and strict Amity betwixt two souls, there is such an
intimate union, and communion, as that no separation, or distance of Place, or
Time, can make a breach thereon; but it is still maintained, in all Absences of
the persons, by means invisible, as much as, or more than, other Unions, and
Communions are by the most potent, and visible means. And thence Moses, Deuteronomy.
13.6. makes the union of friends to be the highest among men, even as that with
thine own soul. But now the union and communion which is between Christ and his
friends is of an higher Nature. We shall speak,

1. 1. The friends of Christ should confirm and improve their union with
Christ.
Of that Union with Christ, which his friends ought daily to aspire after. Al
true friendship, whether Natural, Civil, or Divine, consists in Union, or
rather Unity: And by how much the more intimate, and deep the Union, or Unity
is; by so much the more inviolable, and complete is the Friendship. A Dionysio
dicitur, quod amor est unitiva virtus. Quanto ergo id, unde Amans est un^m cum
amato, est majus; tanto est amor intersior: and rursus, Quanto id ex quo est
unio, est magis intimum amanti, tanto amor est firmior. Aquinas contra Gent. l.
1. c. 91.
In Civil Amity, that between conjugal Relations is most entire, and
inseparable; (til death make a breach:) because the Union, or Unity between
Man and Wife is most intimate: For these are, by the Law of their Creation, one
flesh, Genesis 2.23. Ephesians. 5.28. Hence Christ makes use of this conjugal Amity,
as a symbolick Image, or lively shadow of that conjugal Union, and Friendship
which is between himself and his Church, Ephesians. 5.32. And indeed, al other
Unions in the World, are but Metaphors, and Shadows, if compared with this
Union, between Christ and his friends. Hence therefore it necessarily follows,
that the more the friends of Christ Confirm, and Improve this their conjugal
Union with Christ, the better friends to him will they approve themselves. This
Amicable Union with Christ admits of a great Latitude, both of Kinds and
Degrees, wherein the friends of Christ ought to make daily procedure, in order
to the Improvement of their Amity with Christ.

(1.) 1. Relative Union.
The friends of Christ have a Relative Union with Christ, as he is their
public Representative, Surety, Advocate, commun Head, and Husband. This
Relative Union they ought daily to improve, in order to the Justication of
their Persons, and Sanctification of their Natures. Did Christ, as a public
person make himself a Piaculum, and Anathema, or Curse for his friends? O then!
how should they make themselves blessed in him? Did he, as their Surety, die
for them? Should not they then as poor Bankrupts, Live in, and upon him? Was
not this Paul's Ambition, and life, Phil. 3.9, 10?

(2.) 2. Habitual Union with Christ.
The Friends of Christ have an Absolute, and positive Union with Christ; which
is either Habitual or Actual. 1. Habitual Union with Christ, arises from the
Inhabitation of the Spirit, and those Divine Habits of Grace, infused by him.
Now this Habitual Union is improved, by a singular, indulgent regard to the
Spirit of Christ; with Immediate, Absolute, Total, Incessant Dependence on him,
for all Grace. Does the Spirit of Christ inhabit, and take up his abode in the
Hearts of Christ's friends? O! what a tender regard then should these have, to
such an Inmate? How delicately, and friendly should they treat such a Guest?

2. 2. Actual Union.
As for Actual Union with Christ, it is either Intellectual, or Moral.

(1.) 1. Intellectual.
Intellectual Union with Christ consists in those glorious Ideas, or Notions,
and Images of Christ, whether Contemplative or Active, which are impressed on
the mind. For, look as the eye has an Ideal Union with the Sun, or any other
object, by having its Image impressed on it self: Just so the believing mind
has an Ideal, or Intellectual Union with Christ, by having the glorious Idea,
or Image of Christ impressed on it self, as 2 Cor. 3.18. Now the more real,
spiritual, distinct, evident, deep, affective, and effective Notions of Christ
his friends have, the more prevalent, and efficacious will this their mental
Union, and Friendship with Christ be. Oh! what Admirable, incomparable friends
of Christ might we be, had we but more feeling, clear, lively, particular, and
efformative Notions, or Ideas of Christ in our Understandings?

(2.) 2. Moral Union.
Moral Union with Christ is either Adhesive, or Affective. 1. Adhesive.
1. Adhesive Union consists in the Wills Contract with, and Adhesion to Christ
as its friend. As the Mind is one with its Object, by the Reception of its
Idea, and Image, into it self; so the Will is one with its object, by Egresse,
and Adhesion thereto. And, undoutedly, this moral Adhesion of the Will to
Christ, greatly conduces to the Improvement of friendship with him. For
Friendship, in its formal Notion, implies a kind of Indivisibilitie: Friends
give up themselves entirely each to other, and hence they are to abide and live
out of themselves, each in other: And so Christ expects the Hearts of his
Friends, should be wholly for, and with him; as he is wholly for, and with
them. As Christ abides continually in, and with them by his Spirit; so their
Wills must abide continually in, and with Christ, by firm Adherence, as Hos.
3.3. Thou shall not be for another man, so will I also be for thee. This greatly
improves friendship with Christ.

2. 2. Affective.
Moral Affective Union with Christ, consists in the effluence, or flowing forth
of spiritual and passionate Affections toward Christ, as before Sect. 4. A
nicitia ex duobus facit unum per affectum Aquin.
And O! how much does this conduce to the Improvement of Conjugal Union and
Amity with Christ, as Cant. 8.6, 7. Set me as a seal upon thine heart, etc.

2. 2. The friends of Christ must make daily procedure in communion with Christ.
The friends of Christ should aspire after, and contend for a more Intimate,
deep, spiritual, and sensible communion with Christ; and that in all Ordinances,
Duties, Providence, and Enjoyments. Union with Christ lays the Foundation,
but communion gives the formal Spirit, Reason, and Life to our Amity with
Christ. Perfectio secunda in rebus addit supra primam: Sicut autem esse and
natura rei consideratur secundum primam perfectionem, ita operatio secundum
perfectionem secundam. Oportet igitur in Deum redire non solum secundum
similitudinem Naturae, sed etiam secundum similitudinem Operationis. Aquinat.
contra Gent. l. 2. c. 46.
As in nature, the second Act, or Operation, adds an higher degree of
perfection, to the first Act, Habit, or Principle: So here, Communion with
Christ, which consists in Divine, and gracious Operations, adds much
perfection to the first Act, Habit, or Principle of friendship with Christ. For all first Acts, or Habits, are ordained for, and so perfected in, and by their
second Acts, or Operations: and as God is in himself a pure, simple, eternal
Act; So the more our habitual friendship exerts it self, by gracious Acts of
communion with him, the more Assimilation to God it partakes of. Again, mutual
conversation, and Fruition is the main end, and therefore the most essential
part of friendship. For why do friends confederate, and link themselves
together, by such intimate, inviolable bonds of Amity, but for more complete,
and uninterrupted conversation? And what is more Delectabilissimum est amicis
convivere. Aquin. contr. Gent. l. 3. c. 103.
delectable and pleasing to friends, than to converse together, and enjoy each
other? Thus it is apparent, that communion is the end, and perfection of
friendship among men. Item, hoc videtur esse amicitiae manime proprium, simul
conversari cum amico: conversatio autem hominis cum Deo est per
contemplationem. Aquin. contra. Gent. l. 4. c. 22.
And, we need no way dout, but that according to the mesure of communion with
Christ, such will be the mesure of Friendship with him. As amongst men, frequent
visits, and familiar conversation or communion does mightily confirm, and
improve Friendship: so here, familiar conversation, and communion with Christ,
is very efficacious for the Improvement of Friendship with him. Shinesses,
Distances, and Estrangements are the gangrene of civil, but much more of Divine
friendship. Alas! the friends of Christ neither Think, nor Affect, nor Talk,
nor Act, nor Live as such, longer than they Think, Affect, Converse, and Live
with Christ. Al we mind, say, or do without this, comes to Nothing. Whatever
conduces not to the Enjoyment of Christ, is but lost: The Life, Work, and
Business of a friend of Christ, consists in conversation with Christ. Al we do
without this, even in the highest Duties of Religion, is but a loitering,
dreaming, sleepy Formalitie. Neither may the Friends of Christ expect, that he
will walk with them in ways of Conduct, Grace, Peace, and Comfort; unless they
walk with him, in ways of Communion: Yea, is not this the Suburbs of the
celestial Jerusalem, the entrance into our eternal Rest? And may we expect a
complete Heaven hereafter, if we are unwilling to begin our Heaven here? Is not
communion with Christ the richest, sweetest, noblest, best, and most satisfying
Life? Have the friends of Christ ever more Strength, Warmth, Peace, and
Comfort, than when they are nearest unto Christ? Does not the Health, vigor,
and exercices of the New creature, depend wholly, on the soul's abiding in
Christ, and his abiding in the soul, by daily mutual communion, as Joh. 15.5?
What is it that brings the friends of Christ into a state of Divine Amplitude,
or Liberty; but Intimate communion with Christ, as their friend? Whence
springs the Firmitude, Stabilitie, and Harmony of Grace; but from continual,
uninterrupted Dependence on, and conversation with Christ, the Fountain of al
Grace? Do the Friends of Christ ever shine with a more visible Luster, and
glory? Are their Graces ever more Illustrious, and beautiful, than when they
have been with Christ on the Mount? Was it ever known, that the friends of
Christ came to visit him, and returned emtie-handed? Does not Christ always
follow his friends, with fresh communications of Grace, and Peace, when they
follow him by Acts of Faith, and Love, with other parts of communion? How then
comes it to pass, that the friends of Christ are so much strangers to him?
Alas! what can support you in a day of trouble, but the company of Christ your
friend? And can you expect his Gracious, and comfortable presence in evil
days, if you will not walk and converse with him, in your good days? If Christ
cannot have your hearts, and company in Canaan, may you not justly expect,
that he bring you again into a Wilderness? Believe it, if you are real friends
of Christ, he must, and will have your company, first or last: If he cannot
have your hearts in the fulness, and abundance of al things, he will have them
under the want of althings: if his Gracious, and sweet Visitations will not
allure you, his bitter, and severe Visitations shall drive you to him. O then
follow Christ, while in ways of mercy: draw near to him, walk with him, day
by day, in ways of Communion; Endeavor after communion with Christ.
and then dout not, but he will walk with you, in ways of Grace, and Comfort:
keep close to him in all Times, Conditions, and States, and he will keep close to
you.

(1.) 1. In all Religious Duties and Ordinances.
Maintain daily communion with Christ in all Duties and exercices of Religion.
None live up to their Dignity, and Duty, as friends of Christ, but such as
eye, and enjoy him in their Religious Duties and Exercices, whether private or
public. It Is good to be much in duties; but it is better to be much with
Christ in duties. Religious duties, and Ordinances, they are Christ's Galleries,
wherein he is held, ( Cant. 7.5.) by his friends, that draw nigh to him
therein: but as for mere formal, legal Duties, wherein Christ is not minded,
they are the Devil's Galleries, wherein he is held. O! if ever you would be
found to be real, and faithful friends of Christ, be sure you satisfy not your
selves with duties done, unless you meet, and enjoy Christ therein.

(2) 2. In all Providential occurrences.
If you would fulfill, and walk up to your Relation, and Dignity as friends of
Christ, then maintain communion with him in all Providential Occurrences,
whether Consolative or Afflictive, smiling or frowning. Remember, that God's
Providence are often a good Comment on his Promises: his Works frequently
expound and explain his Word unto us: and therefore his friends, at least such
as are wise, will understand the same; as also the loving kindness of God shining
therein, Psalm. 107.43.
as Psalm. 107.43. Whosoever is wise and will observe those things; even they shall
understand the loving kindness of the Lord. He had discoursed here of the Works
of God's Providence; which his wiser friends would observe. The friends of
Christ, when Providence smiles on them, their hearts should be thereby allured
to him: it suffices not them, to enjoy mercies from Christ, unless they can
enjoy Christ in their mercies. And then for Afflictive, frowning Providence;
if Christ sees it meet to withdraw comforts from them, they must see it their
duty, and endeavor to make it their practice, to withdraw their Hearts from
those comforts: The less they enjoy of the creature, the more they should
enjoy of Christ, in all his afflictive Visitations. A great part of our
communion with Christ, consists in the fellowship of his Cross: and none
usually prove more loyal friends of Christ, than such as have got the Art and
skill of communion with him on the Cross. As Christ was most exalted in Spirit,
when crucified in the flesh; so the friends of Christ should endeavor
conformity to him herein. To live a sublime, high, elevated life of faith, in
their lowest conditions. As an humble, self-abasing Spirit greatly adornes an
high condition; so an exalted, sublime, high Spirit, or life of faith, greatly
adornes a low, afflicted condition in the friends of Christ.

(3.) 3. In creature comforts and Inferior goods.
The Friends of Christ should make it their work to enjoy Christ, in all
creature comforts, Inferior Relations, and Enjoyments. Christ alone must be the
matter of their Fruition and Satisfaction; and al other things matter of use
subservient to Christ. Nothing is good, farther than it comes from Christ's
heart, and draws our hearts to him. O! what rich, and delicious lives, might
the friends of Christ lead, would they but eye, and enjoy Christ in all their
Creature Comforts? I have known one, and indeed a great friend of Christ, who,
I verily believe, enjoyed more of Christ, and his Gracious presence, in his
Civil Employments, and Creature-injoyments, than many (yea, may I not say than
most) Christians do, in their most spiritual duties and Ordinances. O! What
might we enjoy of Christ, in the visible Book of Nature, and Creature Comforts,
had we but spiritual hearts?

SECT. 7. The Friends of Christ must make it their main Study, and Endeavor,
to give all the content, that may be, to Christ.
7. 7. Advice to give Christ all the content that may be.
THe Friends of Christ should make it their main, yea only Study, and Endeavor
to give Christ all the Content that may be. This is another great Admonition,
and Advice for the Friends of Christ, such as affect to live up to their
Relation, and Dignity. Per hoc, quod aliquis Amicus consttuitur, (...) offeasa
removetur: Amicitia enim affensae contrariatur. Aquinas cont. Gent. l. 4. c. 21.
For certainly, none Act, and Live, and deport themselves as the friends of
Christ, but such as study, and endeavor to content, and please him.
Disgustful, and displeasing Carriages, even among equals, are very much
unbecoming, yea, sometimes destructive to Friendship: But how much more
unbeseeming the friends of Christ, who are so far inferior to him, are all
disguiful, or ungrateful deportments toward Christ? Is there any thing more
becoming the friends of Christ, than this, that they studiously endeavor, by all
means possible, to please and content so good a friend? This implies these
particulars.

1. 1. Christ's friends must do nothing that may grieve Christ, or his Spirit.
The friends of Christ must do nothing that may be disgustful, and displeasing
to Christ, or his Spirit, they must not grieve either one or the other: For if
the Spirit of Christ be grieved, he himself is also grieved. So Esa. 63.10. But
they rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit: therefore he was turned to be their
enemy, and he fought against them. So far as men vex the Spirit of Christ, so
far they vex him, and of a friend make him their enemy. Thence Ephesians. 4.30.
And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, etc. If the friends of Christ can be so
unkind, as to grieve his Spirit; they must expect that Christ will be so just,
and faithful, as not to pass by such unkindnesses, without grief from them.
Now Christ and his Spirit are grieved, and displeased.

(1.) 1. Avoid visible Relapses or secret Indulgences.
By Visible Relapses into grosser sins; or secret Indulgences in lesser sins.
For, look as natural grief arises from the presence of any repugnant, or
displeasing object; so, proportionably, Christ, and his Spirit are grieved, at
the presence of any prevalent sin, or lesser sin approved of. Private
Dalliances with any darling lusts; yea, small omissions of known Duties, if
allowed of, and lived in, are great griefs to Christ, and his Spirit. And the
better friend Christ has been to any of us, the more he is grieved at the least
Dalliances with, or Indulgences in sin, either of omission or commission.

(2.) 2. Beware of Backslidings.
By Secret Backslidings of Heart, or Abatements, and Remisnesses of our first
Love are exceeding grievous to Christ and his Spirit. The Physician tells us,
Omnis dolor ex solutione continui. River. Prax. Medic.
That al grief in the body, procedes from the solution of the continuum: If
any bone be out of its place, or any member rent from the body, this cannot
but cause grief in the Head, and whole Body. This holds most true here; the
Backsliding heart is out of joint; it has left it is place; and therefore this
cannot but greatly grieve Christ. Thence we find Christ sadly complaining of
backsliding Israel, Jer. 2.2, 5.
Jer. 2.2. I remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, the Love of thine
espousals -- 5. What Iniquity have your Fathers found in me, that they are gone
far from me, etc? Oh! this grieves Christ to the heart, it makes him fetch many
a deep sigh, and groan, to speak in the Scripture phrase, that those who have
entered into a Covenant of Conjugal Amity with him, should turn aside from him
to Idol-lovers. So Joh 6.67. Then said Jesus to the twelve, John 6.67.
will ye also go away? Christ, having made a sublime Sermon, touching spiritual
Manducation, or the eating his flesh, and drinking his blood, these were but
enigmes, or hard sayings to the carnal Jews; they could not bear such Spiritual
Mysterious Doctrine; and therefore they turned their Backs on Christ, and bid
him Adieu. Yea, some of his true Disciples begin to shrink, and hesitate.
Wherefore Christ turns short upon them, with this sharp rebuke, Will ye also
go away? What? Ye my friends, who have entered into a Covenant of friendship
with me, and have received from me such signal Marquis of Love, Honor, and
Favor; who have had such particular Regards, and Indulgences from me, Will ye
now leave me? Oh! this breaks mine heart, I cannot bear so great unkindnesses:
Who would ever have imagined, that you, my friends, would have dealt so
unkindly with me? True indeed, I never expected other usage from yond crowd of
carnal friends: are they gone? fare well to them: I mind them, as little as they
mind me: they cannot be more weary of me, than I am weary of them, by reason of
their Unbelief. But oh! as for you, my friends, who have professed so much
Friendship to me, and received such high marquis of friendship from me, it will
deeply wound mine heart, if ye go away.

2. 2. Christ's friends must content him, by growing up more into his Image.
If we would give content to Christ, we must endeavor to grow up more and more
into the Ressemblance, and Image of Christ. The more like we are to Christ, the
more content he takes in us. Every one delights in the Reflections of his own
Image. God and Christ take complacence in nothing, but their own Infinite
perfections, and the finite emanations, and Reflections of the same Glorious
Image, in their friends. Christ has a love of Benevolence, and Goodwil for all
the Elect; but his love of Complacence, and delight terminates no where, but on
the Saints, his regenerated friends. And the more any friend of Christ partakes
of his Image, the more delight Christ takes in him. There is nothing in the
world so beautiful, and glorious as Grace; and therefore nothing can give
Christ more content.

3. 3. We must please Christ, by displeasing Self.
Christ is most contented, and pleased, when self is most discontented, and
displeased. As when Self is gratified, Christ is most disgusted; so the more we
disgust, yea, abjure and abandon Self, whether Natural, Moral, or Religious
Self, the more we gratify, and please Christ. And the reason is evident;
because Christ has not any Enemy more diametricly opposite, than Proud Self,
Self-Wisdoms, Self-conceits, Self-humors, Self-wil, Self-interests,
Self-forces, Self-righteousnesses, and other Self-sufficiencies. Wherefore the
Renunciation, and Abnegation of this Monstrous Idol, Self, must needs be most
contentsome, and pleasing to Christ.

4. 4. Flexibilitie toward Christ contents him most.
Flexibilitie toward Christ, his Soverain Will and Grace, gives most content to
him. Amicitiae propri^m est cons^ntire amico^ia his, quae vult. Aquin. contra
Gent. l. 4. c. 22.
It is made a main Propriety of Friendship, to consent to our friend in those
things that he wills. Now the Will of Christ is explicated to us in his Precepts,
Promises, and Providence: the two first express to us his reveled,
legislative Will; which is the rule of our Doing, and Believing: the latter,
namely his Providential Will, declares to us, what God has decreed by his secret
Will; and so gives us matter of submission, and suffering. Now the Hearts of
Christ's friends should be flexible to al these his Wills. That iron sinew which
is in proud will must be broken, that so it may fall in pieces, yea, lie in the
Dust at Christ's feet; as it was with Abraham, Esa. 41.2. Called him to his
foot, etc. His will was so flexible, as that it lay level with the Will and
Providence of God. Our Wills naturally are Adamantine, flintie, and hard: and
Christ has not a prouder enemy out of Hell, than an obdurate inflexible Will.
Grace alone makes the Will flexible. The friends of Christ should be inflexible,
and stiff against all the blandissements, and Allurements of Idol-friends; but
very flexible and pliable toward Christ, his Will, and Spirit of Grace.

(1.) 1. Toward Christ's will of Precept and Providence.
The friends of Christ ought to be exceeding flexible toward the Soverain Will
and Pleasure of Christ either Preceptive or Providential. Open or secret
Repugnances, and Rebellions against Christ's Will of Precept; as also froward
vexatious Humors, or pettish, discontented murmurs against his Will of
Providence, are very disgustful and displeasing unto Christ. Christ's friends
are styled, 1 Pet. 1.14. (...), 1 Pet. 1.14
Children of obedience, or such as have an ear to hear, when ever, or where
ever Christ has a mouth to speak, either by Word, or Providence; an obedient
flexible ear, and heart. Opposite to these are, Colos. 3.6. Children of
Disobedience. (...), i.e. such children as have insuasible, inflexible ears, or
stiff, hard, disobedient hearts, that cannot complie with Christ's Soverain
Will of Precept, and Providence.

(2.) 2. Toward the gracious Movements of Christ's Spirit.
Christ's friends must be very flexible toward his Promises, Terms, and
Spirit of Grace. Christ vouchsafes his friends many secret, sweet
Inspirations, and Gracious Movements of the Spirit; for the reception and
Improvement whereof, they ought to have very flexible Spirits. They ought to be
very obsequious to the Spirit's Motions: As their hearts should be very
flexible to the Words of Christ, so also to the Works of his Spirit. It Is good
striking whiles the Iron is hot, and sailing whiles the Wind blows: the
Spirit, says Christ, blows where he lists. When the Spirit of Grace inspires
or breathes in pious Motions; the heart must respire, or breathe back pious
Affections toward Christ. The friends of Christ should obey the Gracious
Inspirations of the Spirit, as God himself. Fr. de Sales Introduct. a la vie
Devote.
'These Inspirations are (says a devote Papist) those Attractions, Movements,
Reproaches, Interior Remorses, and Illuminations; which God works in us,
preventing our heart by his Benedictions, to the End that he may awaken,
excite, and draw us unto Virtues, and good Resolutions.' Now these the hearts
of Christ's friends must be very flexible unto, if they will content Christ. To
resist Christ's Spirit provokes him much.

5. 5. Fidelity toward Christ.
Such as will content Christ, must study and Endeavor after the greatest
Fidelity, and Loyalty toward him, especially in difficult times. Fidelity
is an essential part, yea the Spirit and soul of Amity. We ought (says the
serious Jansenist) to study fidelity in the least occurrences; S. Cyra^.
Let. Chrest. p. 422.
as a veritable friend, who is more wounded in his own heart, by the least
Infidelity which he commits, than his friend, against home he commits it, is
wounded.' An unfaithful friend gives Christ no better content, than an open
enemy.

6. 6. Frequent Addresses to Christ.
Frequent Addresses, and Applications to Christ for Grace, and Conduct, give
much content to him. As Absences, Distances, and Estrangements from Christ
greatly displease him; so daily Supplications to, Dependences on, and Converses
with him, are hugely pleasing to him. None please him better, than they who are
most humbly confident, and bold with him for Grace. Absenciae enemiga de Amor.
Spanish Prove.
Absence is a great enemy to Amity, and therefore very disgustful to Christ.

7. 7. Civilitie and respects due to Christ.
The Friends of Christ must be very civil, and respective toward him: they
must perform al Acknowlgements, Respects, and Ceremonies of friendship, which
are due to Christ. Civilitie is the performance of those Ceremonies, and
Respects which are due. And certainly, if Rudenes, and Incivilitie be a sin in
any, it is in the friends of Christ, who give not their best Respects to
Christ, who most deserves, and therefore, may well expect them. Without dout,
the best breeding is to be Civil, and Respective to Christ, our best friend.
And the more friendly Christ is to any, the more unkindly he takes al
Incivilities, and disrespects toward himself. And this is, to me, a great
Observation, That the least disrespects or unkindnesses, which Christ receives
from his peculiar Confidents, and friends, especially, such as have received
great marquis of favor from him; are more displeasing to him, than great
provocations of other Professors, who never received so great kindnesses from
Christ. O! Would the friends of Christ but walk in ways wel-pleasing to him,
how pleasing would al his ways be unto them? Would they but make it their
business, to content, and please him, what could discontent, and displease them?
Would not al Duties, Mercies, Afflictions, yea, the whole Creation be pleasing,
and serviceable to them? If our Lord be pleased, what need we care who be
displeased? If he be a friend, what matter is it, who be our enemy? If he
smiles, let the whole world frown, it matters not. Oh! Were our ways but
obedient, and complacential unto Christ, how gracious, how sweet, how
influential, how complacential would his ways toward us be? Could we but keep
close to him in his ways of duty, how close would he keep to us in all our
ways of suffering? But alas! alas! here lies the worm of al our comforts, the
sting of al our sufferings, we give not Christ, our best friend, that content
which is due to him; and therefore it is no wonder, we find no more content in
duties, or sufferings for him.

SECT. 8. The Friends of Christ must take al their content in Christ, both as
the first Spring of Grace, and also as the adequate object of their Beatitude.
8. 8. Advice the friends of Christ must take al content in him. Motives
thereto.
OUr next Admonition, and Advice to the Friends of Christ, in order to their
living up to the Dignity of their Relation, is, That they take al their
content in Christ. This indeed, is the Top of Amity with Christ, and that
which has an essential connection with, yea, seems a main branch of the forgoing
Advice. For, according to the mesure of content we take in Christ, such a
mesure of content we give unto him. The Friends of Christ never give more
contentement to Christ, than when they take al contentement in him: They must
be content with Christ alone, yea, in point of Beatitude, make him their Great
Al, or else they will not give content to him, no nor yet unto themselves. For
this Divine Art, of finding al contentement in Christ, is not more the Duty,
than the Privilege, Dignity, Perfection, and Felicity of the friends of
Christ. It is the Supreme Interest of the friends of Christ, to make him their
alone Wisdom, Forces, Riches, Dignities, Pleasures, Peace, Liberty, Life,
Self, and Al. Yea, May we not say, that Christ is, and ought to be the main of
his friends Heaven? A little weight of Amity, and Confidence, laid upon
creature-friends, will soon break their back, and turn them into Idols, and
broken reeds. None can bear, and therefore none ought to have the main Pondus,
or weight of our Friendship, and Confidence, but Christ. Our main Errand into
this world, is but this in sum, to give al content to Christ, and take al
content in him, as our best friend. If our Affections were more extensive, than
all the Affections of all the Angels, united in one; yet were they al, yea,
infinitely more than al these, due to Christ. Other friends, in themselves
deserving, if compared with Christ, deserve nothing of our spiritually conjugal
Amity. This made the Psalmist cry out, Psalm. 73 25.
Psalm. 73.25. Whom have I in Heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth,
that I desire besides thee. This good man had many friends in Heaven, whom he
loved well: there were his Fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, etc. whom he
could not but greatly estime, and love: yet al these, if compared with Christ,
were nothing: he had some regard for them; yet took not his main content in
them: in this regard he cries out, Whom have I in Heaven but thee? So also for
his friends on Earth; he had without dout many whom he much valued; perhaps
Wife, and Children, and Parents, who were dear to him: ay, but if they come
into compare with Christ, he counts them not worth the naming: he bids Adieu to
al earthly friends, crying out, and there is none upon earth that I desire
besides thee. As if he had said: Lord, I profess, I can take my main content
in none, but thy self: If thou take away al mine other friends from me, and
give thy self to me, I count I lose nothing of mine essential felicity: if I
lose al other friends, and gain thy self, I adjudge it an happy loss. Give
thy self, and take al else, I am content: I may seem miserable, but I cannot be
so; because thou art mine Al; the alone object of my contentement, in whom I
take infinite complacence, and satisfaction. Al things without thee are
nothing; thou thy self without althings, or any thing else, art enough to me.
Thus this great friend of Christ solaced, and contented himself with God in
Christ alone. And Oh! of what infinite moment and concernement is it, to the
Friends of Christ, to content themselves with him alone? What are other
contentements under Heaven, but night-shadows, sick-dreams, childish toys,
pleasing Fables, painted Metaphors, fools Idols, fair nothings, yea, black,
salt, sour, bitter vanities, and vexations, sugared over with vain conceits?
Can the heart therefore find an easy logement or contentement in any thing
below Christ? Ought not he to be the Root, and top, the Flour, and Spirit of al
our delight and Satisfaction? Is not every squint-eye, every oblique Regard to
this adulterous Idol-world, spiritual Fornication, as Jam. 4.4? Does not our
Lord tell us, Mat. 5.28, 29. he that casts a lustful look, or regard on a
Woman, commits Adultery? Must not then every wanton glance, on any Idol
friends, for the satisfaction of our hearts, be reputed spiritual Adultery?
And is it not infinite unkindnes for the friends of Christ, who are his by
conjugal contract, to expect content in any other lovers? Does the World, or
Idol-friends, deserve your hearts, better than Christ your Husband? What can
content you, in a day of visitation, and death (which cannot be far) save this
your friend? Will not contentement in this your Husband, make you find
contentement in every cross and rod? Is there not a time coming, when nothing
will, or can content your hearts, but the favor of this your friend? Yea, is he
not content with you? Does any thing in the world please, and content him so
much, as the hearts, and company of his friends? And will you not be content
with him? Is he wholly, and entirely for you, and will you not be wholly, and
entirely for him? Have you a better friend in the World, more able, and
willing, to support, feed, comfort, and content your hearts, than Christ? Can
you expect to mend your choice, or better your contentement by exchange? You
have long hunted for content among the creatures; but did you ever find it
there? Is there any thing but blood to be drawn from those Breasts? Do you not
feed on Ashes, as Esa. 44.20. Wind, Vapor, Froth, and Smoke, so long as you
feed on creature-contents? Is it not an ignoble, dishonorable thing, to prefer
eye-pleasing contents, before the Infinite sweets, and satisfactions that are
in Christ? Again, does it not argue great Disloyalty, and Disingenuitie
toward Christ, to expect contentement from any thing besides himself? Is it
not disloyal, yea indecent for the Wife to expect content, from any but her
Husband? Does not this provoke Christ, your Husband, to extreme Jelousie? Has
Christ given you any Just cause for such usage? If you grow indifferent toward
Christ, may you not expect that he also grow indifferent toward you? If his
Beauty, Goodness, Amiablenes, and Suavities will not draw your hearts, to take
al your contentment in Christ, What may you expect, but that his rods drive
you, from your Idol-lovers, to himself? Such of Christ's friends, as will not
take up their content in and with Christ, in the Abundance of al things, how
justly, how kindly does Christ deal with them, when he strips them of al other
Lovers, thereby to gain their hearts wholly to himself?

But to speak a little distinctly to the manner, Directions, How the friends of
Christ must content themselves in Christ alone.
how the friends of Christ must content themselves, in, and with Christ alone.

1. The Friends of Christ must content themselves in him alone, as the first
principle of their spiritual Life, the commun Head, and Root of al Grace. Al
veins of carnal confidence, and self-dependence must be abandoned. 1. As the
spring of al Grace.
There must be an Universal, Absolute, Immediate, total, and particular
Dependence on Christ, for all Grace, both Habitual and Actual; Justifying and
Sanctifying; Preventing, Quickening, Confirming, Enlarging, Sin-mortifying,
World-crucifying, and soul-transforming Grace. Christ must be al in all as to
Grace. But of this before, Sect. 3.

2. 2. As the matter of their Happiness.
The friends of Christ, must content themselves in and with him, as the matter
of their Felicity, and Beatitude.

(1.) 1. Christ must he loved for himself. (...)
They must regard, affect, and enjoy Christ for himself. For, whatever we
content our selves in, and with, as the matter of our Happiness, that we eye,
love, and enjoy for it self. If we do not regard, and love it for it self, we
do not make it the matter of our contentement, but that other thing, for which
we regard, and adhere to it. A rational Being, much more the friends of Christ,
may love, and enjoy nothing for it self, but God in Christ, who is the alone
object of their contentement. The friends of Christ should have their hearts
rent from al Reflections on, or Regards to themselves, and althings else, for
themselves; that so they may love, and enjoy nothing but God in Christ for
himself: And hence it will follow, that by how much the more they forget, yea
lose themselves, and enjoy Christ for himself; by so much the more true content
will they find. O! what an admirable piece of Divine contentment is this, to
find al fulness in Christ, by being emtied of our selves; al riches in Christ,
by the relinquishment of al for him; al contentements in Christ, by
discontenting our selves? Christ will have his friends to affect, and rejoice in
nothing but himself, as the object of their supreme content. And certainly, its
the Interest of Christ's friends, to love, and enjoy nothing for itself, but
God in Christ. That is a perverse, crooked, inordinate, adulterous Love; which
takes more content in the Rings, and Love Tokens, than in the Lover. To take
Christ only for some inferior Goods, that flow from him, without regard to
those superior Goods that are in himself, alas! what is it but to make Christ
serve a turn only, and then bid farewell to him? To love God for himself as the
last end; and also for his Benefits as incicements and motives to love him, may
stand well together: as a child loves his Mother, because she is his Mother;
and he loves her also for an Apple. Rutherf.
It Is true, Christ allows his friends to have an eye to, and Affection for his
Benefits: But how? not for themselves, as the only Reason, and bottom of their
Love; but as Motives and Means conducing to the Enjoyment of himself; who is
the adequate object, or matter of al content. Christ's friends may retain some
room in their hearts for his Attendents, and Benefits; provided, that it be in
subordination to himself: they must always love and delight in the Bridegroom
himself, more than in his Gifts. His comforts are sweet, but himself ought to
be sweeter to his friends; who may not d^te upon his love, or any thing below
Himself.

(2.) 2. Christ our most universal Good, and so the chief matter of Fruition.
Hence, if we will take al our content in Christ, as the matter of our Happiness,
we must intend, affect, and enjoy him as the most universal, comprehensive,
choicest, and best Good. This follows on the former: for whatever we eye, and
affect for it self, we look on, and make our supreme, and chiefest Good; and
thence, the alone object of our Fruition. There is no true contentement, but
what springs from Fruition: and there is no regular Fruition, but what is
conversant about the chiefest Good. Fruition is the end of Love, but the
beginning of contentement: none loves any thing as his best good, but what he
would fain enjoy; and none would enjoy any thing, but what he would fain find
contentement in. For, to enjoy any thing, in a proper sense, is, as Augustine
well observes, by love to adhere unto it, for it self. Whence it is evident,
that nothing properly is, or may be the object of our Fruition, but God in
Christ: We may use the Creatures, as means subservient to this higher end, but
we may Enjoy nothing but God in Christ, as the matter of our Happiness.

(3.) 3. Christ the spring of our satisfaction.
To content our selves in, and with Christ, as our objective Felicity, implies
thus much also, that we make him the alone spring of our satisfaction. For
whatever we make the commensurate, formal object of our Happiness, that also we
make the Fountain of our Satisfaction, so Psalm. 17.15. I shall be satisfied,
when I awake with thy likeness. Satisfaction, can be formed out of nothing, but
the chiefest good: and the more intimate, and complete our Fruition thereof is,
the more contentement, and satisfaction we find therein. The more the friends
of Christ are swallowed up, and, as it were, lost in the fruition of Christ,
their chiefest Good; the more contentement they find. O then! how should they
hunger, thirst, long, and breath after, and solace themselves in those Divine
satisfactions that are in Christ?

(4.) 4. Christ to be enjoyed without mesure.
To content our selves with Christ, as the matter of our Happiness, implies, an
Infinite thirst, or boundless desire after the Enjoyment of him. For whatever
we make the Adequate object of our Happiness, that we can never excede in the
Enjoyment of. The only mesure of our love, and fruition of the chiefest Good,
is to love, and enjoy it without al mesure. He that contents himself with
Christ, as his choicest good, thinks he can never enjoy too much, or enough of
him.

(5.) 5. Christ the mesure of other Goods.
He that contents himself with Christ, as his best good, makes him the
Universal Idea and mesure of al other Goods. For our chiefest Good, is always
our Last end: and what we make our Last end, that we ever make the first
mesure, or standard of al other Goods. The first in every kind is the mesure of
all the rest. So that, if Christ be our best Good, he is also our Last end; and
thence the first mesure of al our Goods. Al other inferior Goods, must subserve
the Enjoyment of him, as our supreme, choicest Good.

SECT. 9. The Friends of Christ must live by Faith, in all states and conditions
of suffering, immediately by, or for Christ.
9. OUR last great Advice, in order to the Filling up, and Improving this
Relation of Friendship with Christ, is, In all states and conditions, of
suffering to live by Faith. Faith is the Life and Soul of friendship with
Christ: and the more we live by faith, the more we live as the friends of
Christ. Faith is the master Vein, that conveigheth vital spirits, to all the
laws of friendship. What makes the friends of Christ, more intimately one with
him, that firm Adhesion to him, by lively acts of faith? Does not this keep
their hearts close to Christ, and Christ's heart close to them? What is there
that breeds more self-jelousie, and confidence in Christ, than clear, repeted
acts of faith? Who are they that depend least on themselves, and most on
Christ, but such as live most by Faith? Is not the believing soul, so far as
his faith is predominant, most zealous for, and obedient to Christ; and yet most
poor in Spirit, and Dependent on Christ? Does not Faith make the friends of
Christ so diligent in the use of means, as if there were no Grace to be trusted
in; and yet so absolutely dependent on Christ, as if there were no means, or
diligence to be used? And is not this, (to mention no more) one of the purest
strains of friendship with Christ? But to speak more distinctly to this Head:
The life of Faith has a great latitude; it regards variety, both of Notions,
Persons and Things; and these both present, and future. But we shall, at
present, treat of it only as it regards a suffering condition, and that (1.)
Immediately By Christ. (2.) For Christ.

1. 1. The life of faith as it regards a suffering-condition by Christ.
We shall begin with the life of Faith, as it regards a suffering condition
immediately by Christ. He that will deport, and demean himself as a friend of
Christ, must live by Faith under al sufferings by, or from Christ; namely,
under al Christ's, Absences, Retirements, withdrawments of Gracious, or
Consolative Influences, etc. Christ has many Wise, and Gracious ends, which
induce him often to retire, and withdraw, at least as to al sensible marquis of
favor, Christ has many wise and gracious ends in his spiritual withdrawments.
from his best friends Christ is resolved to be Lord of his own presence, and
love-visits: the most excellent Spirits shall sometimes want the same; that so
they may learn to live by faith, on an absent Christ. Many good friends of
Christ do, too often, dote on the sweet refreshments, and honey-dews of Christ's
presence; and therefore he sees it fit, at times, to suspend the same; that so
they may love him more purely for himself, his own essential excellences. We
are too apt to conceit, that Christ's presence is a matter of debt, that which
is due to us; and therefore he will take a liberty to go and come, as he
pleases, that so his friends may see, that his Manifestations are most free,
and undeserved. Does not Nature take her times to go and come, as it pleases
her; and shall not Christ, the God of Nature, have the same liberty allowed
him? Yea, is there not also much soverain love, and Grace, as well as much
soverain will, in Christ's Absences, and Retirements from his friends? It Is
true, Christ's Absence from his friends, is a kind of temporary Hell: ay but,
does not he bring a young Heaven out of this seeming Hell? Do not Apples of life
spring out of this bitter root of spiritual Defertions? Is there not much
invisible, love, and Grace wrapped up in Christ's visible departure from his
friends? Paul saw much of love and mercy in the pricks of that thornie
Tentation, which Christ left him under, to prevent the Tumur of Pride, 2 Cor.
12.7. lest I should be lifted up, [(...), like a Meteor in the air] above
Mesure. He knew, the Cup was mixed by Christ's own hand, and albeit it was very
bitter, yet there was no poison in it. Does not Christ often hide himself, that
so his friends faith, and Love, may find him out? Are not his delays of
returning, intended, as incentives to make his friends seek more earnestly
after him? True indeed, the friends of Christ, in time of Desertion, think they
are gone many degrees back; ay, but do they not really advance, at least in
several Graces, in the end? Do they not hereby gain more vile, mean, cheap, and
humble estime of themselves; but more large, and deep, and high, and broad
thoughts of Christ? Are not their longings, and lovesicknesses after Christ
more vehement? Do they not arrive to a greater mesure of self-diffidence, and
confidence in Christ? Is not their spiritual poverty, and self-emtines much
augmented? Have they not a more tender deep sense of, with stronger conflicts
against sin? Have they not more Evangelick, and serious purposes of
entertaining Christ more kindly at his return? Such are the sacred Benefits,
which often attend Desertion: and albeit the Lord's Retirement for a while, be
not formally an act of love; yet is it not so intentionally on Christ's part?
Are not the Graces of his friends hereby drawn forth in their most glorious
exercices; namely, to adhere to, love, and confide in an obsent, angry,
frowning Christ? And is not the sincerity, and excellence of Grace hereby
greatly tried, and approved? Does not Christ often intend most Grace, where he
sometimes most suspendeth the sweet refreshing tokens of his Presence?

Now these, How the friends of Christ must live by faith under al his Absences.
with many others, being the gracious fruits of Christ's Absence, and
Retirement from his friends for some time, does it not greatly concern them to
live by Faith, under al such withdrawments of Christ? Are not these some of the
most noble raisures of Friendship with Christ, firmly to adhere to, and follow
after, an absent Christ; yea, although he may seem to turn as an enemy
against the soul. Ought not faith, by fresh election, and recumbence, avouch
Christ to be hers; albeit Christ may seemingly deny the soul to be his? Did
not the Woman of Canaan discover Heroic strains of friendship toward Christ,
in this particular, Mat. 15.
Mat. 15.22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27. (1.) She addresseth her self to him as an
humble supplicant, Mat. 22.
V. 22. But what comfort does he afford her? Gold comfort indeed; Mat. 23.
for V. 23. He answered her not's word. One would think, her faith could pick
little encouragement out of this: What worse Hell can there be to a Believer,
that no answer from Christ? Ay, but does not her faith spy somewhat of Heaven,
in this seeming Hell? Does she not apprehend somewhat of an answer in this
filence of Christ? Thence she continues to cry after him: But yet he repels
her again, Mat. 24.
V. 24. with, I am not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Isracl. What
bottom has she for faith now? Is not the door quite shut against her, by this
repulse? Does not this seem worse than no answer? Is it not as much, as if
Christ had said; Woman, be gone, I have not for thee, I have nothing to do with
thee? Ay, but yet her faith knows how to improve this seeming denial: Though
Christ would not own her for one of his lost Sheep, yet she is resolved to own,
and avouch him for her Lord: Mat. 25.
So V. 25. Lord help me. What answer does Christ make now? Mat. 26.
V. 26. It Is not meet to take childrens bread, and cast it to Dogs. One would
think, her faith was now quite puzzled, and non-plust: but indeed it was never
more Victorious, Mat. 27.
as V. 27. and she said, truth Lord, etc. Was not this also the posture of
Job's Spirit, when he resolved to retain his confidence in Christ, though he
should kill him? And did not David's friendship with Christ greatly discover it
self in this, that he resolved to follow after Christ, though he seemed to fly
from him, Psalm. 63.8? Is it not then a grand duty, incumbent on all the friends
of Christ, to live this generous life of faith, under al spiritual Desertions,
and withdrawments of Christ? Would not this turn their felt, or apprehended
Hell, under Christ's Absence, into a believed, coming Heaven? But to descend to
some particulars of this life of Faith.

1. 1 In keeping up good thoughts of Christ.
The friends of Christ must, in all his Retirements, on spiritual Desertions,
keep up good thoughts, and maintain an high estime of Christ. This is a great
part of the life of faith under spiritual Desertions. For how apt is Unbelief
to strike in, and raise many black lies, and false reports of Christ, in his
Absence? Unbelief is a very cloudie, dark thing; and therefore extreme prone to
cloth Christ, with monstrous frightful shapes of wrath, and severitie,
especially in the dark night of Desertion: and such misjudgements of, and
Prejudices against Christ, are greatly obstructive of a weltempered friendship
with him. The friends of Christ ought to expel al Unbelieving jelousies of
Christ in his withdrawments; and persuade themselves, there is much of love and
kindness, even in Christ's frowns; bowels of Sympathy and pity, under the
cloak of wrath, with which he seems to be covered. A quick-sighted faith may
see something of Christ in all Desertions; which yields matter of Hope, and good
opinion concerning him: and although the cup, that Christ gives his friends to
drink of, be very bitter, and nauseous to flesh and blood; yet faith may taste,
and smell something of Christ therein. Christ's absence from his friends, albeit
it be a kind of temporary Hell, yet it has something of Heaven engraven on it.
For Christ never deserts his friends so much, as not to leave behind him, some
pledge and pawn of his Return. When Christ is gone, al of Christ is not gone:
yea, does he not frequently, in his most salt, and bitter desertions, send now
and then a Messenger, or love-token: at least some invisible supports, and
insensible Inspirations of the Spirit of Grace; which are sufficient
Demonstrations, that he has not totally left such souls, but will ere long
return again? Is it not then a great office of Faith, to banish al these
groundless jelousies, surmises, and misreports of Christ; and to maintain
high, and candid thoughts of him, in all his Retirements? Alas! what is Faith,
but an high, noble, generous, and candid estime of Christ? The friends of
Christ may have as low estime of themselves, as they will, or can; but yet, so
long as they have an high estime of Christ, let his withdrawments be never so
long, or tedious, there is no danger of any breach in their friendship. Though
Christ should cast his friends into a sinlesse Hell of Desertion; yet could they
there but retain high, and great estime of him, it would prove no small Heaven
to them. It is unbelieving misjudgements, and hard censures of Christ, that
make the greatest breaches on Friendship with him, in his Retirements. When
Christ is gone, if our good opinion of him be not gone, al is well. Fear not
Christ's compassionate regard to thee in his absence, if thou find in thine
heart an high, and affectionate regard to, and estime of him. Herein consists
the admirable temper, and good nature of faith, that it mournes deeply, and
longs greatly for an absent Christ; and yet it dares not misjudge him in his
absence. And O! What a Soverain, efficacious influence has such a
sweet-humored, good-natured opinion of Christ on friendship with him?

2. 2. Submission to Christ under desertions.
This life of faith, in times of spiritual defertion, implies a meek, humble,
passive subjection, or submission to Christ's Soverain afflictive Pleasure,
under al spiritual Desertions. Unbelief is full of impatient clamors, and
murmurs, materially blasphemous, against Christ; but faith is a mighty
flexible, and submissive Grace: it can allow Christ his times to go and come:
it remembers, al Christ's love-visits are of Free Grace, and therefore he must
not be quarrelled with for the withdrawment thereof. Faith is mighty
inquisitive after Christ in his absence, yet dares not be querulous, or
clamorous against him: it is greatly sensible of Christ's withdrawments; but
yet dares not repine under them: it is willing Christ should have his will,
though it be with it is own loss: and if Christ may gain by it is private
losses, that is some content to it. Yea, so far as faith prevails in the
friends of Christ, they yield not only passive, but also active submission to
his afflictive Will under desertions: they know how to miss, as well as possess
Christ's smiles.

3. 3. Adherence unto Christ.
This life of Faith imports, a tenacious fixed Resolution, or determined
purpose, of adhering unto Christ, and following after him, notwithstanding al
his departures from the soul. Albeit an absent Christ be a kind of no-Christ,
to spiritual sense; yet such is the Di^ine instinct of Faith, as that it cannot
but adhere to him still. Though Christ may seem to let go his hold-fast of the
deserted soul; yet faith still keeps it is holdfast of Christ: yea, often, the more
Christ seems to shake off the believing soul, that clings about him; the more
strongly does it adhere to him. Christ's seeming repulses, do but work stronger
Impulses of faith and love toward Christ. Thus it was with the Woman of
Canaan, Christ's seeming repulsion, does but work in her a stronger impulsion
of faith and love, Matthew. 15.24, 25, 26, 27. Mat. 15.24 -- 27.
Christ seems to break finally with her, but she cannot break with him: she had
an invisible Instinct of faith, which kept her heart close to him, under al his
Repulses. Yea, what a mighty Sagacitie is there in her faith? What an
ingenious, and quick retortion, does she make to Christ's repulse; by granting,
she was a Dog, and content to be so accounted, on supposition, she might be a
Dog under his feet, and at his Table. Surely her faith was no fool, but very
ripe-witted, and sharp-sighted, in that it could spy out such a forcible
argument to urge Christ with, even from his own Objections. O! What an
admirable Chimist is faith, to extract the Spirit of promises, out of denials?
Her faith traffiqued with Christ, in the dark: his very denials were turned
into Encouragements: He calls her Dog; but she takes that well, provided she
might be but one of his Dogs, and eat of the crumbs of mercy, that fall from his
Table. Christ seems to drive her from him; but she runs not from, but to him,
and clings about him by faith. The more Christ Repetes, and doubles his
denials, the more she repetes, and doubles her faith: her faith was
long-breathed, and could not be tired out by all Christ's repulses: Though
Christ casts her off, again and again; she avoucheth him to be her Lord, and
adores him as such. Yea, how artificial and witty is her faith, to retort an
Argument out of Christ's own mouth, to prove her question? What a good
conclusion does she draw, from hard premises? This is a noble piece of faith,
and an high degree of friendship, which al Christs's friends must aspire after,
even to turn Christ's denials, into arguments of faith and adherence.

4. 4. Desires to please Christ.
Another office of Faith under spiritual Desertion is, to study, and desire to
please Christ, notwithstanding al his displeasing earriages to the soul. Christ
often, under his Retirements, puts on the masque, and vizard of an enemy; and so
gives many severe lashes, especially in case of great backslidings, and
relapses. Now in this case, for the soul to endeavor, al ways possible, to
please Christ, this is an high act of faith, and friendship with Christ. So
David, with other friends of Christ.

5. 5. Longings after Christ.
Again, the deserted soul must make Christ's Absence and delays, an occasion
and ground of stronger longings, and cries after him. As among intimate
confidents and friends, absence does but inflame Affectionate desires after
each other: so here; as in the case of the Spouse, Cant. 3.1, 2.

6. 6. Against faintings.
In all Christ's absences and delays of return, beware of fainting, and
sinking Despondences. Though Providence may seem to cross promises, yet assure
thy soul, Christ can as soon deny himself, as deny his word: yea, were he not
true and faithful to his promise, he were not true and faithful to himself.

7. 7 Make wants food for faith.
Get that Golden Art of converting al Desertions, and deprivements of Grace,
into a Means of Grace. This is the admirable Dexterity of faith; it can pick
up food for a gracious life, even out of the deprivement of gracious
Influences: yea, sometimes it makes Grace, especially humility and the like
Winter-Graces, to thrive most, under the suspension of Christ's sensible
presence.

8. 8. What is wanting in sense make up in faith.
Lastly, What is wanting in spiritual sense make up in Faith. The purest acts
of faith are those, which have least of spiritual sense, to aid and relieve
them. Faith often makes Christ very near, when he seems furthest off as to
spiritual sense.

2. The advantages of faith in suffering for Christ.
Having dispatched the offices of Faith, under al sufferings immediately by, or
from Christ, we now proceed to the life of Faith, as it regards sufferings for
Christ. And indeed the right management hereof, has no small influence on
friendship with Christ: For, usually, none approve themselves, better friends
of Christ, than they who suffer most for him: Neither are there any pieces of
friendship more difficult and rare, than such as are attended with most
sufferings for Christ. Hence it will easily appear, of what a mighty use faith
is, to the friends of Christ, in order to the conserving, and improving their
friendship with him under the cross. What is there that can bring, to the
suffering friends of Christ, Gain out of Lesses, Liberty out of Slaverie,
Glory out of Shame, a centuple, or hundred fold out of al deprivements, yea,
victory and life out of Death it self; but this victorious, efficacious life
of faith? What is it that keeps the suffering friends of Christ, from being
persecuted out of their professed friendship with Christ, but a lively Faith?
Faith assures the soul, it is better to weep with Christ, than to rejoice with
the world; to be poor with Christ, than to be rich with worldlings; to be in
prison with Christ, than to be at liberty with his enemies; to bleed and die
with, and for Christ, than to live and reign with men. Faith knows ful-wel,
that all the sufferings of Christ's friends are transient, and short, but their
joys coming, and eternal: yea, that their Ils work for Good; whereas the
Goods of worldlings work for their il. Faith alters the nature of the Cross,
and makes it a great blessing to the friends of Christ: it takes out the sting
and poison, and infuseth a medicinal virtue into every cross. Such, with many
others, are the advantages of faith in all sufferings for Christ.

But now to get this Divine Art, Directions for a life of faith under the
Cross.
and skill of faith, for the right management of the Cross, take these
following Directions and Rules.

1. 1. Give no way to to hard thoughts of the Cross.
Give not way to unbelieving, hard thoughts of Christ's Cross. Unbelief fills
the mind with many dismal, black, ugly, ghastly, and hard Apprehensions of
Christ's Cross: it looks-upon the Cross, as a bitter, sour, black, fruitless
Crab-tree, and therefore possesses the heart with deep disgusts, and
prejudices against it. Wherefore one main office of Faith is, to remove the
scandal, and il report, that Unbelief brings on the Cross. Now this faith
does, by discovering the admirable Benefits, and sweet fruits of the Cross;
how much liberty of Spirit, is gained by bonds for Christ; how much peace of
conscience, by troubles from men; how much spiritual gain, by temporal losses
for Christ; how much Christian Glory, by the reproaches of men: yea, faith
teaches the friends of Christ, that the worst of temporal Crosses, even death
it self, for Christ, is better than the most flourishing Crown, or treasures of
Egypt, Heb. 11.26
Heb. 11.26. Estiming the reproach of Christ greater riches, than the treasures
of Egypt. Moses's faith preferred the reproach, tears, losses, bonds, sighs,
and banishment of, and for Christ, before the Glory, worme-eating joys,
gains, laughter, and delices of Pharaoh's Court. Farther, faith shows, that
the evils of the Cross are but Imaginary, and transient; that it is alarming
fears, and noises are worse than it self. Lastly, faith shows the blessed
fruits of the Cross; how full of Divine Admonitions and Instructions it is;
What a friend it is to Grace, though an enemy to Nature; what a soverain
Antidote against sin it is; how much it humbles for small sins; how much the
scum of sin is drawn off by this furnace of Christ; what a great mesure of
faith, love, and other Graces grow on this blessed Tree; how much free Grace is
enhanced hereby, etc.

2. 2. Keep under lawless self and soft nature.
Another office of faith, in order to the right management of the Cross, is,
to keep under lawless self, and soft nature, which is very apt to murmur,
despond, or faint under the Cross. Now this faith performs, by discovering,

(1.) What wise, and infinite reasons there are, why Christ's friends should
cheerfully submit unto, and lie level before his Cross.

(2.) What a brutish, blasphemous sin discontent under Christ's Cross is; how
much madness, and folly lies wrapped up herein; in that, it deprives men of
themselves, and turns reason out at doors; whereas Divine contentement keeps
the heart fixed in the greatest storm, and makes men masters of themselves;
which is the greatest security.

(3.) Faith keeps down self, and soft nature, by nailing them to the Cross of
Christ, and thence deriving influence for their Destruction.

3. 3. Faith must espouse the Cross.
Faith must not only submit unto, but cheerfully espouse the Cross of Christ.
There lies an absolute, and essential obligation on al Christ's friends to
espouse his Cross, as well as his Person: This faith alone enables them to
perform, and that by discovering the intimate connection there is between
Christ and his Cross; as also by drawing down influence from Christ, whereby
the heart is enabled, readily to embrace, delight in, and improve his Cross.
Thus are Christ's friends married to the Cross.

4. 4. Faith must triumph over the Cross.
Another main office of faith, consists in it is triumph over the Cross. Though
the Cross be never so broad, and thick, and dark; yet faith can see through it,
and take a Prospect of coming Glory. Be the burden of sufferings for Christ
never so heavy, faith can make it as light as a feather. Yea, faith converts
our Cross into armor of proof, whereby we prove victorious; it makes our
sufferings our garland, and Crown: yea, as Christ, by dying overcame death; so
his friends by faith in him, even in and by death overcome death; in and by
weakness, poverty, disgrace, slaverie, and wants, they overcome al these.

5. 5. Faith must improve every Cross.
The last work of faith, is to make a wise, and sanctified Improvement of al
Crosses, or sufferings for Christ. Faith in the blood of Christ, has an
admirable dexterity, and miraculous Art, for the Improvement of Crosses^ it
can melt a Cross of Lead, into a Golden Cross of Humility: it can suck the
Milk of Medicinal Grace, out of the bloody breasts of persecution: it can, by
the fire of God's furnace, transform an hard iron-heart, into an heart of
flesh. The Cross of Christ, as managed, and improved by faith, becomes a good
Purgatory of sin, and food for Grace. Yea, faith in Christ can, and often does
make an old Cross, long out of date, become as new and green in fruit-bearing,
and use, as at beginning. Such are the admirable virtues of faith, as to the
Management, and Improvement of the Cross; which gives us abundant
demonstration, of what great use this life of Faith is, in order to our
Improvement of friendship with Christ.

I have now finished our Directions, for walking with Christ as our friend. O
that the friends of Christ would resolve, in good earnest to set about this
work! Is it not high time, after the Lord has been so long contending with us,
from Heaven, by Pestilence, Sword, and Fire, for our friendship and choicest
love, to give it to him? I pretend not to a Spirit of Prophecy, but this I
verily believe, and dare avouch, that it will never be well with us, til Christ
has more of our Thoughts, Estime, Dependence, Intention, Friendship, and best
Affections.

FINIS.
