Mankind, William Gibson.

God is Light, and in him is no darkness at all; if we say we have fellowship
with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the Truth; but if we walk in
the Light, as he is in the Light, we have fellowship one with another, and the
Blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanses us from all Sin,

1 John 1.5, 6, 7. I am the Light of the World, says Christ, he that follows
me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the Light of Life,

John 8.12. While you have the Light, believe in the Light, that ye may be
Children of the Light,

John 12.36. All Nations of them that are saved, shall walk in the light of the
Lamb,

Rev. 21.23, 24. Printed in the Year 1667.

The Epistle to the READER.
FRiend, It is in true tenderness desired of thee, in thy read ng of this
following Testimony, to turn thy mind unto that measure of the good Spirit of
God which he has placed in thee to instruct thee, that thou thereby may be
instructed in the reading of it; for it is that only which does give unto man
the knowledge of the things of God; and as man joins unto this in his heart,
this gives unto him the sight of the things of Gods Kingdom, and to taste and
savor the things that are of God, which while his mind is out from this of
God in him, he can never have the true sight of, nor taste, nor savor the
things that be of God; but thou coming to this, it will cool and settle thy
mind inwardly, so that thou may read in coolness and stilness of mind, without
any prejudice, anger, or byassedness in thy mind; and so if thou thus come to
read, thou may come to receive benefit in that which thou do read, and if
thou so do, then my desire is answered, and my soul therein refreshed; and if
it come so to pass, my soul shall give the glory unto God, who has taught me
those things which I have written unto thee; and I do desire that thou also may
give him the glory, if thou do receive any benefit, for unto him it does belong
for ever.

And this I do say unto thee, in the pure fear of my God, that those things
which I have written in this following Testimony, he has taught me by his
Spirit, which he has given me to instruct me, which while my mind was out from
it, and I did not believe in it, those things which I have here written was hid
from me, and in that state of unbelief I was as dark, and spiritually blind as
others.

Although I could talk much of God and Christ, yet I knew them not, nor the
Heavenly things; I did read of God and Christ in the holy Scriptures, but I did
neither know God, Christ, nor the Scriptures, until I came to believe in the
Spirit of God which he has given me to instruct me; and since I came to
believe in him, and to depend on him for teaching, he has revealed great
things unto me as it is written, The secrets of the Lord are with them that
fear him and it is written, That it is the Lord that teaches his people to
profit and I will teach my people my self says God, I will write my Law in
their hearts and minds, and they shall no more need to say one unto another
know the Lord, for they shall all know me from the greatest of them unto the
least of them, and I will be merciful unto their sins: and I will remember
their iniquities no more; he here speaks of those sins which is committed in
time of unbelief, that when any man or woman comes to believe in his Son
Christ Jesus the Light, whom he has given for Salvation to the Ends of the
Earth, and follows his Son the Light, whom he has given for a Leader and
Commander, to command man to forsake the Devils works, (which is sin) and to
lead him out of the Devils work, which is sin; when man yields and submits unto
Christ Gods Power revealed and made manifest in his inward parts, for to lead
out of sin, and to destroy it, and to bind and cast him out who is the Author
of it, then God forgives and forgets those sins and iniquities, for his Son
Christ Jesus his sake, in whom they have believed; and so they have their sins
forgiven them for his Name sake, in whom they have believed, and unto whom they
have submitted, and by whose Wisdom they are led and guided into those things
which is well-pleasing in the sight of the Lord God; and thus he becomes the
way to God the Father unto every sinful man or woman, that comes to believe in
him, and faithfully to follow him, and thus he becomes the Author of Eternal
Salvation unto every one that does believe in, and obey him; and thus he comes
to help man, as it is written, Help is laid on one that is mighty to save; and
certainly, Reader, his Might and great Power has been received in this present
Age wherein we live, unto a little Remnant, whose minds have been turned
within, to wait in the Light wherewith he has enlightened them, the strong man
of sin, the Prince of the power of the air, who in days past kept the house,
kept the heart, kept the mind of men and women, and did exercise them in those
things which was abomination to God, he has been made to bow, and tremble, and
fall before the Son of God in the heart of man, which Son and Power of God is
greater and stronger then he (who was glorified with the Father before the
World began that heth in wickedness, which he is the God of who has blinded
their minds that is given up to serve him, lest the Light of the glorious
Gospel should shine into their hearts, and lest by this Light he should be
discovered, and his works destroyed, he does labor all that he can to keep
people from believing in this true Light, Christ, who has enlightened every
one that is come into the World: But I say there is a Remnant who has believed
in Christ the Light, and they have felt him the great and mighty power of God,
to make this strong Man of Sin to bow, and he is cast down, and out, who once
did sit in the Temple that God did create for himself to dwell in, even above
all that is truly called God: and in a little Remnant the Lord God has
recovered his own Right, and he now does reign whose right it is, and the
Government is upon his shoulders, and under his Government we do sit with great
delight, and his Fruit is sweet unto our taste; and this is the Name which we
can truly, and experimentally call him, The Lord our Righteousness, for he is
truly so, who has redeemed us out of unrighteousness: and thus God the Father
has made his Son Christ Jesus unto us Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification,
and Redemption; and thus we who sometimes were Foreigners and Strangers from
God, are now brought near unto him; and we that were in days past darkness,
are now made light in the Lord; and we who in times past was dead in trespasses
and sins, has he now quickened; and thus God has made his Son Christ Jesus the
Captain of our Salvation, and the Bishop of our Souls; and we that were once
wandered, and gone astray in our imaginations into diverse and sundry Forms of
worship, he has now gathered us out of those various Forms, where we were
scattered in our imaginations; and we have now found that within us, which we
had long been looking for without us, amongst the false Prophets which Christ
said should come, and that they should deceive many; and he said, They shall
say, Lo here is Christ: but Christ said unto his Disciples, Go ye not forth.
Now, Reader, consider, that Christ said unto his Disciples, before he was
crucified at Jerusalem, I am the Vine, ye are the Branches, as the Branches
cannot bring forth fruit, except they abide in the Vine: no more can ye, except
ye abide in me: and without me ye can do nothing: they were in a measure in
him, and he in them, while as he did walk with them in that visible appearance
which he after did suffer in; and so it was good wholesome Doctrine that he did
preach unto them, when he said, They shall say, Lo here is Christ, and lo there
is Christ, believe them not, go not forth; for that of Christ which they were
come to know, and their minds was brought in unto, that was it which was
sufficient to give them the knowledge of those salfe Prophets which Christ
foretold them of, that they should come in his Name: and therefore it was very
necessary that he should exhort them to keep within with it; and this measure
which they were gathered into the belief of, and feeling of, before his
departure, in that only, and in nothing else could they know him, and receive
him in his coming again unto them, who said, I will not leave you comfortless,
I and my Father we will come and make our abode with you: and they waited at
Jerusalem until this blessed promise was fulfilled, in them, who was endued
with Christ, Gods power from on high; so they were Gods Temples and God and
Christ did walk in them according to his promise.

But now we who have our being in this Age wherein the Whore, the false Church
has sitten as a Queen, and has riden upon the scarlet colored Beast, who
has received his Power, and Seat, and great Authority from the Dragon,
darkness has covered the Earth, and thick darkness has covered us the people;
and so we were darkness, in the power of darkness, and so was hurled up and
down with the false Prophets Doctrine, and was deceived by their fained words,
and fair speeches, with which they did lie in wait for that purpose; and so we
were long learning of them, but was never able to come to the knowledge of the
true God, nor of his true worship by all their teachings; and so Physicians of
no value we have found them to be.

But as the Apostle Paul was sent to open the eye of the mind, which the God of
the World had blinded, by turning peoples minds from that dark power that led
them into sin, unto the Light and Power of Christ in them, which did condemn
for sin, by which they did witness redemption from sin.

So the Lord God has raised up some in this present Age, in the same work, to
turn peoples minds in unto the Light, that thereby they may receive the
knowledge of God, and of his pare worship which is in his own Spirit and Truth,
which the Devil and Sin is out of, and the labors and travels of such as he
does send forth, in his own Power and Wisdom, is very effectual and prevalent
in a Remnant, to turn them unto God: so that thousands that walked in darkness
up and down amongst the false Prophets, and knew not whether they went, because
the Prince of darkness had blinded their minds, is now turned unto God who is
Light, and now they are Light in him, as they were darkness in the power of
darkness, so now they are Light in the Power of God, who is Light, and in whom
there is no darkness at all.

So, as I said before, that which we were seeking without us amongst the false
Prophets, who have cried, Lo here, Lo there, that we have found within us,
Glory, yea, glory to the Lord God for evermore; for it is his own work, and let
it glorify him.

And so Gods Promise we do witness fulfilled unto us, Thus says the Lord God,
I will bring the Blind by a way they know not: and certainly God has fulfilled
this Promise unto thousands, and will fulfill it in many thousands more that yet
walks in darkness, in the ignorance of God and his pure worship in his own pure
Spirit: for when we were wandering up and down in our imaginations, amongst the
false Prophets, in their various invented Forms, which they have variously
invented in their fallen earthly wisdom, then we did not look to be brought to
the knowledge of God by a Light or Spirit of God and Christ within us; for the
Hireling Priests, and other high Professors whom we did follow for teaching,
they did generally agree in telling of us that Revelation was ceased, and that
there was no immediate teaching to be looked for, nor received in this Age; and
they have said (and published it in print unto the Nation) that they have not
an infallible Spirit, as the Apostles and Ministers that Christ sent forth had:
And while we did believe these their sleepy Dreams, and lying Divinations,
thereby we were kept in Error; and so by these their Lies they caused us to
err, and they did labor what they could to keep us from believing in the
Light; but Gods love was such unto our poor distressed Souls, which was thus
tossed up and down by their false Doctrines, That he coused his Light to shine
out of darkness in our hearts, and to give us the Light of the knowledge of the
Glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ: and this Treasure have we in our
hearts, and inward parts, even in the earthen vessels; and so the power and the
excellency of it is of him, and not of us, and to him we give the glory and
honor, for to him it is due for ever, who by his Light which he has caused to
shine in our hearts, has given us to see them, and their false Doctrines, and
false Worships and Ways, and now he has given unto us Christ his Son, his
Covenant of Light to be our Teacher; and this is that Way which once we did not
know: And God said unto man, Thy Teacher shall no more be removed into a
Corner, but thine eye shall see thy Teacher, and thou shall hear a voice behind
thee saying, This is the way walk in it: And we can say Experimentally, through
Gods mercy, that that which in times past came behind us to call us out of
Evil, when we were gone into Evil, even than same has led us out of Evil; and
so that which formerly we were turned from, we are now turned to again, so that
which followed us and condemned us, when we did Evil, that is come before us,
and leads us into those things which is well-pleasing to the Lord our God; and
so Christ Jesus the Light in us is become our Shepherd, and we do hear his
Voice in us, and we do follow him, and he does give us Peace in our inward
parts which neither the Devil nor Wicked men can take from us, if we abide
faithful unto him; And so we are set down under him who is the true Vine, and
we are Branches in him, and so we know that the Son of God is come, and has
given us an understanding to know him that is true, and we are in him that is
true, even in the Son of God Christ Jesus, and this is the true God and Life
Eternal; and he is our Teacher, Bishop and High Priest, and Lord, and King, and
we do believe that he shall no more be removed out of our sight, nor hearing,
but we shall for ever see him, and he shall Live and Reign for evermore; and he
said, Because I live ye shall live also, and we know what he said is true; and
he said, I am the Resurrection and the Life, he that believes in me, though he
were dead, yet shall he live, and he that lives and believes shall never die;
and these things we do steadfastly believe. And as for those Priests and
Professors who say Revelation is ceased, and there is no immediate teaching to
be received in this Age, and those that say they have not an infallible Spirit,
as the Apostle had, as for those that hate the Light wherewith Christ Jesus
has enlightened them, and loves darkness, which is of the Devil, that cannot
reveal the things of God and his Kingdom unto them; and we know that those who
hate the Light, and will not hearken to the Light, nor obey the Light, they can
have no immediate testimony to bear for God unto others, and we know that there
is no infallible Spirit, but the Spirit of God and Christ, and so they who do
not believe in that measure of the Spirit of God and Christ which he has
placed in them to instruct them, they have no infallibility, but they fail of
their Duty toward God, and one toward another, and so they are unprofitable
Servants, and wholly useless in the worship of God, For if any man have nor the
Spirit of Christ he is none of his; now it is certain that the Spirit of Christ
is infallible, it did never fail to fulfill the Will of his Father, and the
Apostle said, God had sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, whereby they
called him Father, and we do confess to the Glory of God that he has sent the
same Spirit of his Son into our hearts, by which we can experimentally call him
Father, and in and by this we have the things of God and his Kingdom revealed
unto us, and are immediately taught by this; and this is infallible, and does
not fail to lead us into all truth, if we do in Faithfulness follow it: and so
it is our Comforter who love it and obey it, but it is, and will be, the
Torment and Condemnation of all those that hate it; So the way of the Wicked is
Darkness, they know not at what they stumble, Destruction and Misery is in
their way, and the way of Peace they know not.

The Priests and Professors who cry Revelation is Ceased, and there is no
immediate Teaching to be received in this Age, and say that they have no
Infallible Spirit.

These People say, that the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament is the
Revealed Will of God; unto them I say, the Scriptures was given forth by the
Inspiration of God, which gives understanding, and they do not stand and remain
Open and Revealed unto any man or woman, but unto such who comes into the
Spirit of God and Christ, which is infallible; for when the Son of God opened
his mouth and spoke unto the World, he spoke in Parables, and they could not
understand his words, because their minds was out from that of God in them; for
Christ told the unbelieving Jews, that they did neither know the Scriptures
nor the Power of God: And now all People whose minds are out from that of God
in them, they can no more know the Scriptures then the unbelieving Jews could,
for it is that from which they were at first given forth which must give People
the true understanding of them; for Christ said unto his Disciples, unto you it
is given to know the Mysteries of the Kingdom, but unto others, who were in the
unbelief, he did speak in Parables; even the same words which to unbelievers
seemed Lies and madness, even those words was made plain unto them; And their
hearts did burn within them, when he opened unto them the Scriptures, after his
Resurrection; and I say the Scriptures is a book sealed from all People, who
has the Light, and will not own it to be their Teacher, and they are jangling
and quarrelling about the meaning of the Scriptures, and so are fighting and
striving one with another about the Shadow and Outside of things, and never
comes to Christ the Substance; for said Christ to the unbelieving Jews, Search
the Scriptures, for in them ye think you have Eternal Life, But ye will not
come unto me that you might have Life, He did not say you cannot come unto me,
but he said you will not come unto me that you might have Life; so Reader thou
may see they had a Stubborn will, who would not come unto Christ: God said
unto man in the days of old, I have set Life and Good, before thee, and Death
and Evil; and God did not, nor does not say unto man, Choose Death that thou
may dye, but he did say and does say, choose Life that thou may live:
Paul said, I will that Prayers and Supplications be put up for all men, in as
much as God would have all men to be saved and come to the knowledge of the
Truth; and Christ said, How often would I have gathered thy Children together
as a Hen gathers her Chicken under her wings, but ye would not; and God said,
O Jerusalem, thy destruction is of thy self, but thy Salvation is of me, I
delight not in the death of him that dies, but rather that every one would
turn from his wickedness, and Live, turn you, turn you O house of Israel, why
will you die?

The Priests and the Professors call the Scriptures the Word of God, and the
Gospel, now the Scriptures is words, and they were not in the beginning, but
was given forth by holy men, many generations after God had created the Earth
and all things in it, and upon it; and God spoke words unto Moses, Read Exodus
the 20; and the Apostles spoke words in the Word and Power of the Lord, which
was in the beginning before man was, or words either; and whosoever shall add
unto the words of this Prophesic, said John, in his Revelations, etc. So the
Scriptures is words, and not the Word, In the beginning was the Word and the
Word was with God, and the Word was God; By him was all things made, in him was
Life and that Life was the Light of men; And this is that Eternal and
Ingraffted Word, which is able to save the souls of all that do believe in it;
The Prophet hid it in his heart, lest he should sin against God, and it was as
a Fire shut up in the Prophets bones, and it was and is as a Fire, Hammer, and
Sword, and Ax, to cut down the Devil and his Works in the heart of man where it
is received, and no man or woman need say, who shall ascend into Heaven, to
fetch Christ down from above, or who shall descend into the deep, to fetch
Christ up from vexeath, or who shall go beyond the Sea to fetch Christ unto us:
for, behold, the Word is nigh thee, in thy heart, and in thy mouth, that thou
may hear it, and do it; and the four Books of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John,
which the Priests and Professors calls the Gospel, is not the Gospel; for it is
but about Sixteen hundred years ago since those Books were written: But the
Gospel was Preached unto Abraham many Generations before those Books were
written, and the Gospel is Everlasting; an Angel did flee thorough the midst of
Heaven, having the Everlasting Gospel to Preach; That which is Everlasting is
without beginning and without end; now the Apostle said that the Gospel which
he did Preach it was the Power of God; now the Power of God is Everlasting,
without beginning and without end; but books, and words, and writings, had a
beginning and may have an end, so is not the Everlasting Gospel, and there is
no Gospel of God but one, and that one Gospel Paul Preached, and he received it
not from man, neither was he taught it by man, but by the Revelation of Jesus
Christ, and he said, If any man Preach unto you any other Gospel let him be
accursed, So Reader, that Gospel which we Preach, we have not received it from
man, nor from books, nor from writings, but by the Revelation of Jesus Christ
in us; and what we have felt, and seen, and tasted, and handled of the Word of
Life, Spiritually, Inwardly, these things declare we unto People, that they
might believe in God the Father who is Light, and in Christ his Son who is
Light, and that they in the Father and the Son might have Fellowship with us:
and so Reader, we have Revelation among us, and immediate Teaching by the
infallible Spirit of Christ Jesus in us; and as many as walk according to this
Rule, Peace be unto them; for those are the Children of God, even those who are
led by the Spirit of God, which never did fail to bring forth Righteousness in
those that did Obey it: And so Reader, the Priests and Professors, who deny
Revelation, and immediate Teaching, and an infallible Spirit, they can speak
nothing of certainty concerning God and his Kingdom, and things pertaining to
the Salvation of Mankind, but what they do speak is their imaginations and
dreams; so it is not for People to trust unto them for Teaching, for their
mouths must be stopped, which was never yet opened by the Revelation of Jesus
Christ, the Power of God from Heaven, and they are to come and learn in Silence
of the Light in their own Consciences, until it has taught them the Knowledge
of God, and until they come to know the Light to be infallible, and the only
true Teacher.

And now, Reader, I say keep low in thy mind in the Reading of this following
Testimony, and if thou do find something spoken that thou cannot yet wholly join
withal, labor to keep in the Patience, and keep out of Fretting, and be not
Rash; for thou will find things that are evil sharply reproved, in Persons of
all sorts, without respect of persons; and it was the manner of the true
Prophets, and Ministers, and Apostles of Christ, and of Christ himself, to
reprove the false Prophets sharply, and also to Reprove Wicked, Profane,
Ungodly Men, and Women sharply, to the end that they might Repent, and forsake
the evil of their ways.

But it has been the manner of the false Prophets, whom God never sent, to
Daub and flatter and Prophecy Lies unto People, and to speak Peace unto People
in their sins; and Woe from the Lord God, is coming upon those Teachers, who is
making it their Business to Preach up sin for term of life, and to Promise unto
People Peace in their sins; Your Sins has separated between you and me says
the Lord, Your sins has withholden good things from you, and no man or woman
can be joined to God in their sins, and no unclean thing can enter the Kingdom
of God, and as the Tree falls so it lies, there is no Repentance in the
Grave: So People must either witness Clensing and Freedom from sin, before they
go out of the Body, or else they will never be made clean.

God did give the Apostles Gifts, for the Work of the Ministry, for the
Edifying of the Church, which was Christ's Body, until all come unto the measure
of the Stature of Christ, unto a Perfect man in Christ Jesus and the Apostle
did bid People cast off every weight, and burden, and the sin that did so
easily beset them, that so they might run the Race that was set before them,
and they labored that they might present every man Perfect in Christ Jesus;
and the Ministers which Christ does send forth in this Age, their Labor is to
bring People into Christ Gods Power, that they may sit down in Him, in the
heavenly Peace, in him to Reign over sin, and him that is the Author of sin,
which is the Devil; and this the Lord has already done for a little Remnant,
and he will certainly do it for many Thousands more; To him be all Honor,
Glory; Dominion and Praises both now and for evermore, Amen; even so Amen,
says my Soul.

Written the 18th of the 11th Month 1667. William Gibson.

A Tender True and Faithful Salutation unto all People, who in Words profess
God and Christ, in what Form soever.
Friends,
IN true unfeigned Love I have had you in Remembrance, and a tender Pity and
Compassion has risen in my heart unto you, and tender desires are in my heart
unto the Lord my God for you all, 2 Cor. 4.6, 7.
that your minds might be brought down unto the Eternal true Light, wherewith
Christ Jesus the Son of God has enlightened you all, which shines in your
hearts, Joh. 8.12. and 12.4, 6.
and there convinces you of Sin, and reproves you when you commit sin, that
by it you might all come to be led out of sin which is the Devils work: And
this I say unto you all, in dear Love unto all your Souls, if you believe not
in the Light, wherewith Christ has enlightened you, Joh. 3.19, 20, 21.
which checketh you and troubles you when you do evil; I say if you believe
not that God has placed that in you to lead you out of the evil it Condemns
you for, then you will never be led out of it, but you will dye in your sins,
and then it will be with you as it was with the unbelieving Jews and Pharisees
in their days; for said Christ the Light, unto the Pharisees, If ye believe
not that I am he, ye shall dye in your sins, John 1.9. 1 John 1.5, 6, 7.
and whither I go ye cannot come; Mark, if they did not believe, that he whom
they despised and set at naught, was the Son of God, and the Light of the
World, and the Way, and the Truth, and the Life, and the Door of the Sheepfold,
as he declared himself to be, Joh. 14.6.
then he said they should dye in their sins, and if they dyed in their sins,
whither he went they could not come; these sayings of his are true; so because
of their Unbelief they were shut out of the Kingdom of God: and this I say unto
all People, Joh. 8.21, 22, 23, 24
if you do not believe in that measure of the Spirit or Grace or Light of
Christ, which is but one in its nature, Mat. 11.27, 28, 29, 30.
though the names are diverse, wherewith he has enlightened every one that is
come, into the World, then you will certainly dye in your sins; and out of the
Kingdom of God will you be shut, because of your unbelief, even as the
Pharisees was because of their unbelief; for God is no respecter of persons,
Joh. 10.7, 8, 9.
For God so loved the World that he sent his only begotten Son a Light into the
World, that whosoever believes in him should not perish, but have Everlasting
Life; so all who believe in the Light of the Son of God, wherewith he has
enlightened every one that is come into the World, Joh. 1.4.
and dwells, and walks in that Light, in that Light they have Eternal Life;
as it is written, In him was Life, and that Life was the Light of men: and it
is written, He that has the Son has Life, but he that has not the Son has
not Life, but the Wrath of God abides on him; so he that believes in the
Light and Spirit of Christ, and walks in it, it is his Life, it is his Crown,
it is the true Living Way unto him, Rev. 22.16.
and it leads him up to God; of his nature it is, and it leads all people unto
him, who do believe in it, and in faithfulness follow it; it is the bright and
morning Star unto all those that do believe in it, and it does arise in their
hearts, and as they abide in it, it shines in their hearts more and more,
until it has led them out of the thick Night of Darkness and Blindness which
remained over their hearts while they did not believe in the Light; 2 Pet. 1.19
and so the Day Star which did arise in their hearts, when they did believe in
the Light, and took heed unto the Light, it did lead them out of the thick
Night of Darkness and Blindness, which had been over their hearts, while they
did not believe; and the vail has been taken away off the hearts of all those
who have believed in the Light, 2 Cor. 3.14, 15, 16.
and does walk in it; and so the Light which has enlightened every one that is
come into the World, it is of the Divine Nature of God, Who is Light, and in
whom there is no darkness at all; and so it being of the Divine Nature of God,
it leads all unto God who does follow it; but they that do not believe in it,
nor love, nor obey it, it is their Condemnation, as it is written, This is the
Condemnation, that Light is come into the World, Joh 3.19, 20, 21.
but men love Darkness rather then Light, because their deeds are evil; Mark
that, He that does evil hates the Light, and will not bring his deeds unto the
Light, because he knows the Light will condemn him for his evil deeds which
he has done; But he that does Truth brings his deeds unto the Light, that
they may be made manifest that they are wrought in God: But as it is written,
Pro. 4.19. Psalm. 82.5.
The way of the wicked is darkness, who hate the Light, and because they hate
the Light which would give them the knowledge of God, if they did believe in
it, and love it, therefore are they dark, and blind, and stumbles, and knows
not at what. Friends, these things are of great weight for you to consider,
while you have a little time, and do not content your selves with a bare
profession of God and Christ without you, at a distance from you, and from
thence to draw a vain and dead hope that it will be well with you in the World
to come; for I say, If ye die in your sins, whither he goes ye connot come;
and in dear love I say unto you, those sayings of his will certainly be
fulfilled upon you, as they were fulfilled upon the unbelieving Jews, if you do
not believe in, and obey the Light wherewith he has enlightened you: For, I
say, consider the Jews, they looked for the coming of the Messiah, because they
had the Writings of Moses, and the other Prophets, who prophesied of his
coming, yet when he was come they would not believe that it was he, Christ; but
when he did the Works that no other could do, then they said he had a Devil,
and by Beelzebub the Prince of Devils he cast out Devils: Now consider, how came
they to be thus deceived, and thus to judge of him, seeing they had the
Prophets Writings which foretold of his coming: Well, Friends, this I say, they
were expecting him to come in an other manner then he did come; for they
reading that he should be a King and Prince, etc. they looked for him to come
in great pomp and dignity outwardly; but when he came, Mark 6.3.
he came much contrary to their thoughts, and expectations, and imaginations,
for he was supposed by them to be Joseph the Carpenters son, a man of low
esteem amongst them, and so they despised him because of his low Appearance,
which was so far contrary to what they had imagined concerning his coming, and
so they would not have him to rule over them, but they slew him, so they lost
the benefit of his coming, and so died in their sins, and so was shut out of
the Kingdom of God, because of their unbelief; so here was their Misery, they
would not receive him, because he came not according as they had imagined he
should come: Now, Friends, to come nearer to your condition, I shall write as
the Spirit of the Lord shall move me, which dwells in my heart; Friends,
consider, What is the reason that you will not own the Light wherewith Christ
has enlightened you, and all people, to be a sufficient Teacher, and Ordinance
for Salvation unto you, and all people, and to bring you, and all people unto
God (out of sin) if you and they did believe in it, and obey it? I say
consider, Is it not because you have read the Prophets, Christ and the Apostles
Writings with the same dark minds, in unbelief, that the Jews did read the
Prophets Writings, and in the Darkness which you have loved a great deal more
then the Light, you have imagined that Christ would show himself unto you some
other way then by his Light in your Consciences? It has been a very hateful
thing unto many of you Professors to hear us exhort you to turn unto the Light
within, and because we told you that was the Ordinance of God for Salvation
unto the Ends of the Earth, according to the words of the Prophet, who
prophesied in the Power of his coming, Isa. 49.5.6, 7, 8, 22.
who said, I will give him for a Light unto the Gentiles, and Leader to his
People, to be his Salvation unto the Ends of the Earth; and when we have born
our Testimony amongst you concerning this Light, according to the plain words
of the Prophets, Christ and the Apostles laid down in the holy Scriptures, and
in the brokenness of our hearts have in much love unto you, declared our own
experience of the virtuous opperation of this Light wherewith Christ has
enlightened us, and what Christ the Light had done for our Souls, since we in
his Light believed: and when we thus labored in the Love of God to do you
good, in persuading you to believe in the Light wherewith he has enlightened
you, that so you might have come to have felt the virtue and power of it in
your own hearts, for your own everlasting good: then many of you have rejected
our Testimony, and has shamefully entreated us, and has rewarded us evil for
good, and you have hated this Light, and cried, Away with this Light, and also
with those that have been moved of the Lord God to bear witness unto this
Light, Which is the Trve Light which has Enlightened every one that is come
into the World, as the Jews cried away with Christ, when they imagined he had
been Joseph the Carpenters son, 1 Cor. 2.4, 5, etc. to 16.
and so the Light is judged by your Carnal Wisdom and Reason to be too low a
thing to stoop unto; and the Jews in their Carnal Wisdom and Reason judged
Christ when he was come, not to be worthy or fit to be a King over them,
because they looked upon him to be a Carpenters son, a man inferior unto many
of them as they imagined; and so they hated him, and slew him. And so now all
you Professors, who have been, and yet are haters of the Light, and cries away
with it, and accounts it too low a thing for you to stoop unto, you are
deceived, Christ will not show himself unto you any other way, but by the
measure of his Spirit wherewith he has Enlightened you; it is written, No man
knows the things of God but the Spirit of God; but many of you Professors will
not believe that the Light wherewith Christ has Enlightened you, is of power
and sufficiency to bring you to God, out of sin; and so to this day you have
not the Benefit of Christ's coming, but you are still in your sins, committing
them, and pleading that you must do so while you are in the Earthly Tabernacle:
And so are you not Rebellious Children, who Rebel against the Light, Grace and
Spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ which he has placed in you to Instruct you?
And do not you as plainly Crucify, and do Dispite unto the Opperation of the
Spirit, Light and Grace of Christ in your Inwards Parts, as the Jews did unto
the Vessel which they imagined to be Joseph the Carpenters son? So, consider of
these things soberly, in meekness, in the fear of the Lord God, and be not
angry at me for writing thus in plainness unto you; for know you all,
assuredly, that it is the Love of God in my heart unto you, that constrains me
to write thus in plainness unto you; so while you have a little time prize it,
and while you have a sense and feeling of the Light, Grace and Spirit of Christ
in your inward parts checking and condemning you when you do Evil, believe you
all in it, and in obedience unto it give up; and when it condemns you for Evil,
which you have already done, then own its Judgments, for its Judgments are just
and true; and when it lets you see Temptations unto Sin, before you have
consented unto the Tempter, or done the Evil he tempts you unto, then love
it, and let your minds be closely joined unto it, and then it will preserve you
from doing the Evil that you are tempted unto; and then it will be no sin for
you to be tempted unto Evil, if you do it not, nor give your consent at all
unto the Tempter, Mat. 4.1, 2, to 13.
but love the Light which lets you see his Temptation, and in it you will have
Dominion over the Tempter, and you will be kept out of his Snare; for Christ
was tempted, but sinned not, and Christ, the Light, will not condemn you for
being tempted unto Evil, if you do it not, and if you believe in, and love, and
obey the Light of the Son of God wherewith he has Enlightened you: Though you
may have done much Evil, God will forgive you for Christ the Light his sake, in
whom you do believe; and though you may feel great and strong workings in you
to do Evil, yet if you love the Light within you, that gives you the sense
thereof, it will work mightily in you against that nature which would lead you
to do Evil; and if you keep your minds unto the Light, then you will feel that
nature to die daily in you, which has led you into Evil, and so that which
has led you into Evil will be daily weaker and weaker, but that which will
lead you into Good will grow daily stronger and stronger, until it has wholly
overcome that nature which has led you into Evil: but, mark, as I said before,
it is no sin to be tempted to do Evil, but the sin is to do the Evil that one
is tempted unto; so when Christ, the Light, shall give any one Dominion over
the Tempter, so that he cannot make them do any thing that is Evil, yet he will
tempt them to do Evil at sometimes; so all who comes to be preserved out of
sin, they must keep their minds unto the Light within them, daily, Luk 9.23,
24, 25.
yea, hourly, For, said Christ, he that will be my Disciple must deny himself,
and take up his Cross daily, and follow me: mark, he must deny himself, and
take up that which crosses his own, selfish will, and selfish wisdom, for it
is Self in man and woman which leads unto the Tempter, and so commits sin; and
this made Christ say unto his Disciples, Without me ye can do nothing; he said
unto them, Joh. 15. from verse 1, to 11.
I am the Vine, ye are the Branches, as the Branches cannot bring forth Fruit,
except they abide in the Vine no more can ye except ye abide in me; so read the
thing in the Spirit inwardly, If a man believe in the Light of Christ, within
him, and loves, and obeys it, then he comes to be ingrafted into Christ,
the true Vine, then the Light, in which he has believed, is a daily cross unto
self in him, which if it had its way in him, and were not crossed, and kept
down by the Light, then it would obey the Tempter, and so commit sin; but when
the Light is believed in, loved and obeyed, self is judged and denied, and kept
under the yoke and cross; and then it is no more Self that Reigns in Man,
which while it Reigns will answer the Tempter, and so commit sin; but then it
is the Seed of the Woman which Reigns and Remains in Male and Female, which
has in them bruised the wise, and cunning, and crooked, Genesis 3.15.
and wilful Serpents head; and so the Seed Christ the Light comes to Reign over
Man and Woman in their own hearts, and such are come to be born of God, and so
has overcome the Wicked one, and such does not commit sin, because the Seed
Christ Reigns and Remains in them: and then though the Prince of the World
come and tempt such to do evil, they do not obey him, because they have denied
Self, which did commit sin; and now Christ the true Seed, and in whom the
Tempter, the Prince of the World has no part, Reigns, and he is the Lamb of
God who has taken away the sins of as many as have believed in, and in
faithfulness followed the Light within them, wherewith he has enlightened
them; and in such he has fulfilled, in the Substance, that which he did, in
the Figure, in the outward Temple at Jerusalem; For it is written, That he made
a Whip of small Cords, Joh. 2.15.
and whipped out, of the outward Temple, the Buyers and Sellers; And he said,
My Fathers House has been Called a House of Prayer, but ye have made it a Den
of Thieves; this I say was but a Type or Figure of his coming inwardly, in
Spirit, to cleanse the Temple of man's Heart and Body, which was defiled with
Idolatry, Covetousness, Pride, Envy, Lying, Swearing, Cheating, Dissembling,
vain Talking, foolish Jesting, Whoredoms, Murders, Roberies, and diverse other
Abominations which men and women have been defiled withal: And so, Glory to the
Lord God for evermore, he has sent his Son a Light into our hearts, and since
we have believed in the Light of Christ in our hearts, he has cleansed our
hearts from such of the beforementioned evils as we were in the practice of;
and so we have felt and known a sharp Spiritual Scourge inwardly, in our own
hearts, scourging and afflicting our Souls inwardly, for our sins and
iniquities which we did commit in Rebellion against the Light in our own
hearts; and so we have born the indignation of God inwardly, Micah 7.7, 8, 9.
in our own hearts and consciences, and he ha h sitten as Refiners Fire, and as
Fullers Soap, in our inward parts, purifying our hearts, which was sull of
uncleanness, and we have known great pain inwardly, and we have wept and
mourned over the Right Heir, the Seed, Zech. 12.10 11.
the Light which we had Rebelled against, and done dispite unto; but since we
learned obedience unto the Light the Lord our God has forgiven us our
trespasses which we had trespassed against him, and now he guides us by his
Spirit and Light which dwells in us; yea, now are we become the workmanship
of our God, Created by him (in Christ Jesus the Light within us) unto good
works, Ephesians. 2.1, 2, etc. to the end I hill. 2.13.
which he before ordained that we should walk in them, and so it is our God who
works all our works for us, and in us; and so it is by the Grace, Light and
Spirit of our God in our own hearts, which did convince us of our sins, and did
trouble and condemn us for our sins, Isa. 26.12.
that we are saved from our sins; I mean, Tit. 2.11, 12, 13, 14.
we are led out of the Action and Practice of that which formerly we lived in
the practice of, for which the Light, Spirit and Grace, Isa. 1.16, 17, 18, 19.
(which is but one in its Nature, though its Names be diverse,) did condemn us:
And so as the Apostle Paul said unto the Saints in his time. By Grace are ye
saved through Faith, and not of our selves, for it is the Gift of God; Mark, by
the Grace of God which brings Salvation, which has appeared unto all men,
were they taught to deny and forsake the practice of Evil doing, and Evil
speaking, and to judge and deny the Tempter, when he brought an evil thought
into their hearts to do, speak, or give their consents unto any evil; and thus
did they resist the Devil, in the Grace that let them see the Temptation; and
then, when he could not get them to yield unto him, then he fled from them, as
it is written, Draw near unto the Lord, and he will draw near unto you, Jam.
4.7, 8, 9, 10.
Resist the Devil, and he will flee from you: So when they did believe in the
Grace and Light wherewith Christ Jesus the Son of God had enlightened them, and
did join their minds unto it, and loved it, then it began to lead them out of
Ungodliness, Worldly Lusts, and all wicked Words and Works which before they
bad lived in, and did commit with greediness, as many do now in this our Age
and Generation; and then when they followed the Teachings of the Grace of God
in their own hearts, and was by it led out of their sins, which made them
unlike God, (but like the Devil) then they came into the likeness of God again,
which Adam and Eve lost when they went from the Measure of the Spirit of God
wherewith he had enlightened them, and which he commanded them to obey: Genesis
1.26, 27.
And though Adam's Sons and Daughters be ravined from the Spirit of God within
them, and so are committing Sin with greediness, Gen 3 1, 2. etc. to the end.
and draw-Iniquity with Cords of Vanity, and pulling Sin upon them, as it were
with a Cart Rope, yet this is no argument to any good purpose to persuade
people that all people must do as they do; neither is it an argument to any
good purpose to persuade people that there is no better a State or Condition to
be attained unto while men and women bears the Earthly Body or Tabernacle
about, seeing the Apostle Paul said unto the Saints, (who had been in the fall,
ravined from the Spirit, or Grace, or Light in their hearts (but was then, when
he writ unto them, returned to it again) Ye were sometimes Darkness, Ephesians.
5.8, 9, 13, 14, 15.
but now are ye Light in the Lord; mark his words, Ye were sometimes Darkness,
that was before they had believed in Christ's Light within them, which is the
true Light that has Enlightened every one that is come into the World, that
was before they had believed Paul's Testimony, who was sent of God, Who is
Light, Acts 26.18, 23. and 16, 17, ver.
and in whom there is no Darkness at all, to turn people from Darkness to
Light, and so from Satan's power unto the Power of God; but when they had
believed in the Light wherewith Christ had enlightened them, and had received
Paul's Testimony, who was sent to turn them from the Darkness which was in them,
in which they had committed sin, unto the Light which was in them, which had
condemned and troubled them when they did commit sin, then were they Light in
the Lord; 2 Pet. 1.19.
Mark that, in the Lord, and so they were in him who is Light, in God and
Christ, and so they knew God and Christ in them to save them from their sins;
Romans 6.17, 18, 20, 21, 22.
For said Paul, When ye were the Servants of Sin, ye were free from
Righteousness; Mark, that is, they were not in Righteousness, but out of
Righteousness, and so were in unrighteousness, which is sin, for all
unrighteousness is sin, and all sin is of the Devil; But now, said Paul, 1 Cor.
3.10, 11.
being free from Sin, you are become the Servants of Righteousness, and has
your Fruits unto Holiness, and the End Everlasting Life; Mark then, the Fruit
which they brought forth was Holy, and the End Everlasting Life, so here was a
blessed change witnessed while they were in the Earthly Tabernacle; the same
Paul said to some of the Saints, Some of you were Whoremongers, and Adulterers,
but, said be, you are washed, you are ceansed, ye are sanctified; he did not
say unto them, when they were Saints, that they were Whoremongers, and
Adulterers, as many now adays call themselves Saints, and Christians, and yet
lives in much Wickedness and Uncleanness, both of Flesh and Spirit: But when
they were washed and cleansed from their Filthiness, and so was brought into
the Likeness and Image of God again, which is Purity and Holiness, and so they
came to see and know the Lord; and it is written, Without holiness no man can
see the Lord; and it is written, Blessed are the Pure in heart, for they shall
see God, 2 John 3.4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 24.
and the Apostle John said, He that is born of God sins not, he that sins
is of the Devil; we are of God, said he, and the whole World lies in
Wickedness, (Wickedness is Sin) but we are of God, said he; he that is of God
sins not, said he, he that sins is of the Devil; we know, said he, that
the Son of God is come, 1 John 5.18, 19, 20, 21.
and has given us an understanding to know him that is true, and we are in him
that is true; Mark, they were in him that is true, Even in his Son Jesus
Christ, and this is the true God and Life Eternal; and these are true Saints,
and true Christians which is come to witness Christ in them, and has witnessed
him in them to destroy the Works of the Devil in them, which is Sin, and so to
make them new Creatures, as he had made those Saints in Paul and John's days,
2 Cor. 5.17, 18.
For if any man be in Christ, said the Apostles, be is a new Creature; old
things are passed away, said he, all things are become new; they that are
Christ's, said he, have crucified the Flesh with its Affections and Lusts, and
they bad put off, concerning their former conversation, the old man with his
deeds, which is corrupt, and they had put on the new man Christ Jesus, the true
Light, Col. 1.26, 27, 28.
who is the Lamb of God, who has enlightened every one that is come into the
World, that all men, in his Light wherewith he has enlightened them, might
believe; and the Saints and true Christians in the Apostles day; did believe
in the true Light wherewith Christ Jesus had enlightened them, and God by it
did lead them out of Sin, and so out of the Fall; for before Sin entered there
was no Fall, for Sin was the Fall, from God; so who is come unto the Eternal
true Light within them, and by it is led out of Sin, which was man's I all from
God, they are come out of the state of the first Adam, in whose state men are
dead in Trespasses and Sins, and they are come into the Second Adam, the Lord
from Heaven, the quickening Spirit; 1 Cor 15.20, 19.
and though they did once bear the Image of the First Adam, in whom all are
dead in Trespasses and Sins, yet now they are come to bear the Image of the
Second Adam, the Lord from Heaven, the Light which has redeemed them from
their Sins; and though they were once dead in Adam, who fell, yet now are they
made alive by the Second Adam, who never fell: and though they did commit sin
daily, while they were in the First Adams state, fallen and ravined from the
Spirit of the Second Adam in their hearts, yet now being come unto the Spirit
of the Second Adam, which they had ravined from, and now having learned
obedience unto it, it being the Spirit of Truth, or the True Spirit, it leads
them into all Truth, and so out of all untruth; and so all who has in
faithfulness followed and obeyed the Light wherewith Christ the Second Adam
has enlightened them, (they, and none but they) are made alive in and by
Christ the Second Adam; so, as it is written, it is come to be witnessed by
such, As in the First Adam all die, so in the Second Adam all shall be made
alive: Mark, in Adam all have sinned and died, who have been ravined from the
Spirit within them, as he did from the Spirit within him, and so have fallen, and
sinned, and died, as he did; but now all who comes to witness Redemption from
that Estate, they must come into the Spirit and Light within them, from which
they have ravined; and if they do not come to believe in and obey that, they
will never come to be made alive in and by Christ the Second Adam, though they
may talk of, and profess never so much of God and Christ without them, (at a
distance from them) and though they may have a persuasion in their hearts, and
may really believe all that is written in the Holy Scriptures concerning the
Birth of Christ, and of his Death, and of his Resurrection, yet this believing
will not bring them into acceptance with God, if they do not come to believe
in the Light and Spirit of Christ within them: For, I say, in the fear of the
Lord God, consider, Does not all the profane people in all those Nations
ealled Christendom, generally believe that he was the Son of God who was
crucified without the Gates at Jerusalem, and was born of the Virgin Mary, and
rose again the third day, as they read the Scriptures of Truth which bears
witness of those things; and yet, though they have given credit unto those
words which are written of him, many of them are Proud and Covetous, Drunkards
and Swearers, and Liars, Persecutors, Murderers, and Thieves, and Cheaters,
and Dissemblers? Now, I say, in the Fear of the Lord God, consider, Is this
true Saving Faith which they are in? and though they have been taught by
Tradition to believe, as aforesaid, yet their hearts are very corrupt, and full
of wickedness, and so are far from the Lord God, and they are far from being
accepted with the pure God, in that Estate; now the Apostle says, Faith
purifieth the heart, and the Mystery of the Saints Faith, in the Apostles
days, was held in their Pure Consciences, which was Christ in them the Hope of
Glory; 1 Timothy 3.9
so they were in the True Saving and Living Faith, their Faith stood in the
Power, Spirit and Light of Christ within them, and the Power, Light and Spirit
of Christ within them did purify their hearts, and it made them of a Right
Spirit; and so that which purified their hearts dwelt in them, for it is
written, The Tabernacle of God is with men, Rev. 21.3. Ezekiel. 37.27.
I will walk in them, and dwell in them, said God, I will be their God, and
they shall be my people; and Christ said unto the Saints, I and my Father we
will come and make our abode with you; and Christ said unto his Disciples
before he was offered up, He that is with you shall be in you; and he said,
Joh. 6.63.
It is the Spirit that quickens, the Flesh profits nothing; and though the
Apostle had known Christ once after the Flesh, yet benceforth I know him so no
more, 2 Cor. 4.16.
said he: and he said, I bear in my Body the Dyings of the Lord Jesus, that the
Life also of Jesus may be made manifest in my mortal Flesh: Joh. 14.11, etc. to
25.
and he said, I am crucified unto the World, and the world unto me, and the
Life that I now live is by Faith in the Son of God: I Live, said he, yet not I,
but Christ in me; and so he witnessed Christ in him the Hope of Glory: and the
Apostle said unto the Saints, Try your selves, prove your selves, know you not,
your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except you be Reprobates.

Now I say the people of God, who are in scorn called Quakers, do believe and
certainly know that he who was born of the Virgin Mary was the Son of God, who
was hated by the Jews, and sentenced to die by Pilate, though he could find no
fault in him, we do believe that he was crucified without the Gate of
Jerusalem, and was raised again the third day, by the mighty Power of his
Father, in whose will he suffered, though there was no fault in him; and we
believe, and are sure, that God was greatly honored in his Faithfulness,
Obedience, and Humiliation, who though he was without fault humbled himself
unto the death upon the Cross; and we do believe, and are sure, that all that
did believe in him in that Age in which he suffered outwardly, and did confess
him boldly before his Enemies, and suffered death for his Name sake, or
imprisonment, they are everlastingly well, who continued in faithfulness unto
the end: But, consider, O all ye professors, in that called Christendom, it was
a hard and mighty thing in that Age, in which he suffered, to confess before
his Enemies that he was the Messiah, the Christ the Son of God; for to confess
before his Enemies that he was the Son of God, was cause enough for his Enemies
by their unjust Law by which they had put him to death, to put those to death
that should so confess him; So that in that Age there durst none confess him
before his Enemies to be the Son of God, but those who were come to feel and
know the Measure of the Spirit of God which he had given them to instruct them,
for that gave them to know that he was the Son of God, and it filled their
hearts with zeal and boldness to confess him to be the Son of God, though they
were put to death for their Confession; for Christ said, No man can come unto
me except my Father draw him, Joh. 6.44, 45, 46.
so God drew them by the Measure of his Spirit in them to know that Jesus was
the Son of God, and by the same he drew them to confess him boldly before his
Enemies; And Christ said unto his Disciples, Whom do men say that I am, some
said he was John Baptist, and some Elias, But, he said unto his Disciples, Mat.
16.13, 14, 15, 16, 17.
whom do ye say I am, Peter answered and said, Thou art Christ the Son of the
Living God; Jesus answered and said unto him, Flesh and Blood has not revealed
that unto thee, (but my Father only.) But, oh, you Professors, in what Form
soever, consider, It is many Ages past since Christ suffered without the Gate
of Jerusalem, and people have been ravened from the Life and Power and Spirit
in which the ancient Christians lived, for you may read that the Saints were
called Christians fiest at Antioch, Act. 11.26.
and it is very like, at that time, the name Christian was as hateful a name,
both with the unbelieving Jews and Gentiles, as the name Heathen is hateful
here in England, and other Nations who calls themselves Christians; but Christ
and his Apostles wrought many great and wondrous Works in and by the mighty
Power of God, Acts 20.29, 30.
while they were walking upon the Earth among the Sons and Daughters of men,
and they wrote in the Spirit, and Power, and Wisdom of God words, which they
left behind them; and after their decease Grievous Wolves did arise, who was
ravened from the Spirit, and was gone out from the Apostles; in the Apostle
John's days says he, 1 John 2.18, 19, 20, 26, 27.
They went from us, that they might be made manifest they were not of us; For,
said he, if they had been of us, no doubt they would have continued with us:
and Paul, when he wrote unto Timothy, he said, I know that after my decease
grievous Wolves shall arise, who will not spare the Flock: so before the true
Apostles of the Lamb laid down their heads there was False Apostles, and
Deceitful Workers crept in among the Saints, who spoke perverse things, and
did draw disciples after them; but while the true Apostles remained in the
body, they watched diligently over the Flock, over which the holy Spirit had
made them Overseers, and they were a terror to deceit, and kept back the work
of the Devil in the false Apostles and deceitful Workers; for then they were
already entered into the World, and then it was the Last Time, as John said
Fifteen or sixteen hundred years ago, Brethren, 1 John 4.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
as you have heard that Antichrist shall come, even now are there many
Antichrists, and false Prophets in the World, whereby we know that it is the
Last Time.

So all People take notice that Antichrist and the false Prophets were entered
into the world before the Apostles decease, and they have remained in the world
ever since, and this was before the name Quaker was given unto us by the
Scorners; yea, this was before we were born: so that it is plain, that the
Priests and Professors, in all that called Christendom, who have said that the
false Prophets, and Antichrists, and Deceivers, and Seducers came but when
those people they called Quakers came, have all erred in their Judgments, and
so have judged with evil thoughts, and so they must all bear the Judgments of
the Lord God for their false and unjust Judgment upon those they in scorn call
Quakers; for Antichrist and the false Prophets were entered into the World in
the Apostles days, Rev. 17.2, 6.
and after the true Apostles were put to death, and were taken away from
amongst men, then the false Apostles work went more swiftly on, Rev. 18.3.
and they being ravened from the Life, and Power, and Spirit within, they took
the words of Christ and the Apostles, which they had written in the motion of
the Spirit of God in them, and had left upon Record, and they professed them,
and they being ravened from that measure of the Spirit of God from which the
Scriptures was given forth, then they wrested the Scriptures, and gave meanings
unto them, they having lost the Key of Knowledge, and then they went into the
Liberty of the Flesh, and so drew people after them; and then the Night of
Apostasy grew in fast, and the Beast and the false Prophets made war against
the Lamb and the Saints, and they slew the Lamb, and slew many of the Saints,
and so overcame them; and then Antichrists Kingdom did increase fast, and then
the false Church, which was not in God, but in the Dragons power, who had slain
the Lamb and the Saints, it grew great, and then began the false Christians to
be increased, and the number of them to be many; and so the false Christians,
who have taken upon themselves the bare name, but are out of the Life and
Nature of Christ, they are spread over many Nations, and are become a great and
large people: And so it is easy for people now to take the name Christian upon
them in England, and other Nations, for now the whole Nation of England does
profess Christ in words, and several other Nations; so that if a man will
profess Christ without him, as they do, and live in deceit and ungodliness as
they do, and turn and conform unto one Invention and Tradition of man after
another, as they do, then they will not persecute him for professing of Christ
without him, as they do; but if he be one who has believed in the Light
wherewith Christ has enlightened him, and so is come to know Christ in him, to
destroy Sin in him, and that Christ has already led him out of the Sin, which
they live in, then they will persecute him, and as it was in the Apostles
days, so is it now, He that is born after the Flesh persecutes him that is
born of the Spirit; and they that do live godly in Christ Jesus do suffer
persecution: It is evident that the Apostles and Saints in the Ages past
witnessed Christ in them, and so were made new Creatures by the working of his
mighty Power if them; for it is written, If any man be in Christ Jesus he is a
New Creature: Now consider the thing in the fear of the Lord God who searches
all Hearts, Rev. 21.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
and tries all Reins, who will assuredly reward every one according to their
deeds done in the Body; If any man be in Christ he is a new Creature, Old
things are passed away, behold all things are become New; Mark, Old things are
passed away: Now in the Fear of the Lord God, 2 Cor. 5.17
I say, consider the thing well, for it is weighty, What was the old things
which were passed away from the Saints, Ephesians. 4.22, 23, 24.
in that Age in which they lived upon the Earth, was it not Sin? yea,
assuredly, it was Sin, for Sin was and is the Deeds of the first Adam, and all
who are in his state, are dead in Trespasses and Sins; Joh. 1.29.
but said the Apostle to the Saints, You have put off the Old man with his
deeds which is corrupt, Joh. 8.34.
and you have put on the New man Christ Jesus; and Paul said, That as many as
were Baptized into Christ, Jam. 1.12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.
they had put on Christ, and so they were in him, and he in them had destroyed
the Works of the Devil, and so had led them out of Sin, and so had saved them
from their Sins, Gal. 3.27, 28.
for that is the work which God has given him to do for the Sons and Daughters
of men; and all who comes to believe in his Light in their Consciences, and
obeys it, they come to feel these things wrought within them, and not without
them; for it is a plain Truth, and cannot be denied by any sober, wise, and
truly understanding man or woman, the pure and holy God of Life and Power of
Heaven and Earth, he will not be reconciled to any people, under what Name or
Profession of Religion soever, upon the Face of the whole Earth, while they are
in their Sins, that is, while they are in the practice of Evil-doing, rebelling
against the good Spirit of God in them, Isa. 63.10.
which he has placed in them to instruct them; for said God, I gave them my
good Spirit to instruct them, Neh 9.20.
but they rebelled against me; Isa. 30.1.
and he said, Woe unts the rebellious Children who take counsel, and not at me:
Mark, God is a Spirit, and his Counsel is received within people, and his Voice
which gives Counsel is to be heard within people, and that is it which cries
within people, for them to Repent, and to forsake the evil of their doings; and
all who do refuse to hear and obey that of God in them, which calls upon them
to repent, and forsake the evil of their doings, they all refuse to obey Gods
Voice, and to take counsel at him, and so are rebellious Children, upon whom
the Wrath of God abides, and upon them it will abide for ever, if they do not
come to obey that in them which cries unto them to Repent, and forsake the
evil of their ways; for God said, Rev. 3.20.
Behold, I stand at the Door and knock if any man open unto me, I will come in
unto him, and sup with him, and he with me: Oh, people, how often has the Lord
God, who is Light, and in whom there is no darkness at all, knocked at the door
of your hearts, when your hearts have been exercised with covetous practices,
and stuffed full thereof; but alas, there was no room for him, no, Pro. 1.25,
26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33.
you would not open unto him, nor let him have entertainment in your minds, and
so you have rejected his Counsel, and would not return at his Reproof, who
would have had mercy on you, had you returned at his Reproof, and he would have
mercy on you yet, if you would hearken unto his Voice within you, Col. 3.5, 2
and turn at its Reproof, (from the evil it reproves you for) and if you do not
you will perish, The Mouth of the Lord has spoken it, and none can alter it;
for he is above all, and his Words will stand: Alas, consider, you Earthly
minded men and women, Do you not read, That Covetousness is Idolatry, Luke 14.33
and the Love of Money is the Root of all Evil? Alas, consider, what is all
your Religion worth, Mat. 19.28. and 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, verses.
if you love Gold or Silver, Houses or Land, Wife or Children better then your
Religion; and before you will forsake your Gold and Silver, and lose it, or
your Houses and Land, you will forsake your Religion, and join unto a Religion
contrary to your Consciences? Alas, does not this plainly show unto your own
understandings, that you love the Earthly things, Romans 1.25
which you have in possession, Jam. 5.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
much more then the Lord God who created both you and them? and does it not
plainly appear unto your own understandings, that you worship and love the
Creatures which God has created, more then him who created them? and then
consider, what is your Profession of God and Christ worth? what is all your
Religion worth? now I know what the Serpent will say in man and woman, in whom
he rules, he will tell them, that they are not covetous, nor idolatrous,
though they may love Gold and Silver, and does strive still to get more, though
they have much already, and though they do get it by oppressing of the Poor and
Needy, and by Extortion, and by Grinding the Face of the Poor, and by using
many false and deceitful words in their Buying and Selling of Gods good
Creatures; though they may lay House to House, and Land to Land, and so bring
several of their fellow Creatures into much poverty and misery by their unjust
dealings, yet the cunning Serpent will call this good Husbandry, and will tell
such as are led by him into the before mentioned Abominations, that it shall be
well with them in the World to come; I say, woe will be upon all those that are
led by him into the before mentioned Evils, and that does believe his lying
Promises; for he was a Liar from the beginning, so he is not to be believed,
nor his voice hearkened unto; for whosoever does believe him will be undone by
him, for he is a Liar, and a Murderer: And now such as have been professing
God and Christ in words, but with their hearts has served, loved and obeyed
him, now when times of trial and suffering for Religion is come, he will tell
them, that they need not be so strict, for though they do go to the Worship
contrary. to their Consciences, yet says the Serpent, God knows your heart,
that you do not own that Worship to be the true Worship of God, and you do not
join with them in your hearts, though you do go with them to their Worship; and
so, says the Serpent, you may go and keep your hearts clean in the sight of
God, and you may save your goods from being spoiled; and the Serpent will bring
Scripture, and say, He that will not take care for his Family is worse then an
Infidel; and what, will you undo your Self, your Wife and your Children! God
requires no such strictness as this, and this is but an extreme: this is the
Old Serpents Voice which covetous men and women, and proud and envious men and
women have hearkened unto, and obeyed, who has led them into the before
mentioned Abominations; yet he has given them leave to make a great Profession
of God and Christ, and with their Mouths they have spoken much of God, but he,
the old Serpent, has had the Heart, and so it has been far from the Lord God:
And so now the old Serpent has kept his Seat, and Authority in the heart,
notwithstanding all the Profession that has been made of God and Christ, and
leads his Subjects to submit unto one Form of Religion after another, according
to the Precepts or Commandments given forth by men, and so as men changes
their Commandments or Precepts, for the setting up of a new Form of Religion,
so such in whom the Serpent rules, he leads them to bow down unto it, and so
to receive the Mark, and so to turn any way to save themselves from being
imprisoned, or their Goods spoiled, even to turn as the Windmill to the Wind,
or as the Weathercock with the Weather: So, I say, unto all people that are
turning from one Form of Religion to another, to save themselves from
Persecution, consider, what is all your Religion worth, who will not suffer for
it, if you can help it by Swearing, contrary to the Doctrine of Christ, whom
you have much professed in words, who says, Swear not at all; and contrary to
the Doctrine of the Apostles, who said, Swear not by Heaven, nor by Earth, nor
any other Oath; and Christ, who says Swear not at all, he says, If you love
me, keep my Commandments, and his Commandment is, Swear not at all; so it is
plain to the understanding of every truly wise man and woman, that all that do
Swear, contrary to the command of Christ, and thereby breaks his Command,
does not love him; and the Apostle John says, in his second Epistle, He that
transgresses, and abides not in the Doctrine of Christ, has not God; and
this is Christ's Doctrine, Swear not at all: And so all people, who of late have
Sworn unto that which they did formerly Swear against, the Lord God of Heaven
and Earth, he is grievously dishonored by such, for their Hypocrisy is very
great, and their Sin is very grievous in these particulars, besides many other
grievous Abominations, which they have not yet repented of: And so unto all
that are in the before mentioned Abominations, I say, in Bowels of tender Love,
and true Pity and Compassion to your poor Souls, Awake, Awake, Repent, Repent,
come down unto the Eternal True Light in your own Consciences, which does
condemn you for your Hypocrisy, for being Time-servers and Menpleasers, Haste,
haste, to meet the Lord God, by speedy and unfeigned Repentance, while you have
a little time prize it, for the time hastens to come upon you, and all the rest
of the profane ungodly World which lies in wickedness, that time shall be no
more, then the sayings of John in the last of the Revelations will be
witnessed, Rev. 22.11, 12.
He that is filthy, let him be filthy still, mark that, Let him be filthy
still; And there shall not enter into the Holy City any thing that works
Abomination, or tells a Lie; there shall not enter into the Kingdom of God
any unclean or filthy man or woman, for all the Fearful and Unbelievers, who
fears man more then God, is for ever shut out of the Holy City, except they
repent, and come to the Light of God and Christ in them, and so believe in God
who is Light, and fear him, and not man whose breath is in his Nostrils: and
all Persecutors, Swearers, Liars, Drunkards, Whores and Whoremongers,
Adulterers, Cheaters, Scoffers, Mockers, Proud lofty wild and wanton ones,
Repent, repent with speed, Come down, come down to the Eternal True Light,
wherewith Christ Jesus the Son of God has enlightened you, which in you cries
for Repentance and amendment of life; I say, in Bowels of tender love unto all
your Souls, Make speed, make haste to make your peace with God, by submitting
unto, and obeying his pure Light in all your consciences; for the Spirit,
Light, and Grace of God and Christ in you, which condemns you for your Sins,
must either make your peace for you with the Lord God, or else peace with the
Lord God you shall never witness, neither in this world, nor in that which is
to come; Isa. 48.22.
For there is no Peace to the Wicked says my God; for God said unto the wicked
in the days of old, Your Sins does separate between you and me, Isa. 59.2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
your Sins does withold good things from you; so at this day, it is your Sins
that separates between you and the Lord God, and withholds the good things
from you; Luke 19 27.
so come unto the Eternal true Light within you, and be subject unto it, and it
will judge down all your Babilonish thoughts and imaginations which you have
vainly imagined concerning God and Christ, and his Way of Worship, and out of
all your Sins will God lead you by his Light wherewith he has enlightnened
you, if you be subject to it, and he will bring you unto his Everlasting
Kingdom, where you may inherit Life, Peace and Joy for ever; and if you will
not be subject unto this Light, then you are Enemies both unto the Father and
the Son, and must be bound and cast into utter darkness, where there is weeping
and gnashing of teeth, Joh. 5.39, 40.
where the Werm never dies, nor the Fire is never quenched; for said Christ
the Light, Bring those mine Enemies that will not that I should rule over them,
and slay them before me; Christ the Light said unto the Unbelievers, Search the
Scriptures, for in them ye think to have Eternal Life, but ye will not come
unto me that ye might have Life, read John the Fifth; and Christ said unto the
unbelieving Jews, who said God was their Father, that he was the Light of the
World, Mar. 1^. from verse. 23, to 40.
and all that follwed him should not abide in Darkness, but should have the
Light of Life; but those Jews who called God their Father, told Christ, that he
bore witness of himself, and that his witness was not true; but he told them
that his witness was true, (and so it was) and he told those hard-hearted
unbelievers, Joh. 8. from verse. 12, to 26. and from verse 41, to 53.
who said that God was their Father, that they were of their Father the Devil,
and the works of their Father they did, and those words of his were true, read
John the Eighth; they told him, they knew he had a Devil, but they were Liars,
and so they had the Devil themselves, which they told him he had.

And now all you Priests and Professors, of all sorts, who deny those words of
Christ which he speak unto the Jews, when he said he was the Light of the
World, and whosoever followed him should not abide in Darkness, but they should
have the Light of Life, Joh. 9.24, 28, 29. Joh. 10.20, 21.
you are in the same Error and false Judgment that they were in, you are in the
same blindnss of mind, and hardness of heart that they were in; for when he
first spoke those words, they withstood him to his Face, for they did not
believe that he was the Son of God; and now you do profess that you do believe
that he was the Son of God, and yet you will not believe his words: Oh thick
darkness and blindness, the Jews were condemned because they believed not his
Testimony, and do you think to be Saved for the bare professing that you do
believe that he was the Son of God, seeing you will not believe his words which
he spoke unto the Jews? Oh, consider your own selves, whether were the Sins of
those Jews, or your Sins the greater, in this particular? they did not believe
that he was the Son of God, and so they did not believe his words; for had they
believed that he had been the Son of God, then certainly they would have
believed his words: now you do profess that you do believe that he was the Son
of God, and yet you will not believe his words; remember what Christ said unto
the Jews, Scribes, and Pharisees, Mat. 23.29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35.
Woe unto you Scribes and Pharisees, Hypecrites, because you build the Tombs of
the Prophets, and garnish the Sepulchers of the Righteous, and say, if we had
been in the days of our Fathers, we would not have been pertakers with them in
the blood of the Prophets; wherefore be ye Witnesses unto your selves, that ye
are the Children of them that killed the Prophets: Fill up the measure of your
Fathers: ye Serpents, ye Generation of Vipers, how can ye escape the Damnation
of Hell? Wherefore, behold, I send unto you Prophets, Wise men, and Scribes,
and some of them you shall Kill and Crucify, and some of them you shall
Scourge in your Synagogues, and shall Persecute from City to City; that upon
you may come all the righteous Blood shed upon the Earth, from the Blood of
Righteous Abel, unto the Blood of Zacharias, whom ye slew between the Temple
and the Altar.

And now Oh all ye Professors, of all sorts, who will not believe Christ's words
which he has left upon record in the Holy Scriptures, and yet say you do
believe in him; you are judging and condemning the Jews for slaying Christ and
his Apostles, and you imagine and say, if you had lived in the days of the
Jews, who slew Christ and his Apostles, you would not have been partakers with
them in the Blood of Christ and of his Apostles: Oh consider, if Christ were
now walking up and down in these Nations called Christendom, in such a low and
mean Appearance, as he appeared among the Jews in that Age in which he suffered
death among the Jews, and should pronounce Woes against those who calls
themselves Christians, and say they do believe in him, and love him, would not
they be angry at him, and fret at him, and cry away with him? Oh, consider it,
if he should tell the Proud and Covetous, and Envious Priest and Professors,
who calls him Lord, and calls God their Father, that they were of their Father
the Devil, who was a Liar and a Murderer; and if he should call them Serpents,
and a Generations of Vipers, would they not chase and fret at him? and would
they not cry, Away with him? and would they not desire to have him shut out of
their Country? Oh consider of these things, and lay them to heart, ye
persecuting Priests, People, and Professors of all sorts; if you are
Christians, you are Christ-like, now Christ is meek, and he says, Learn of me,
I am meek and lowly in the heart, and you shall find rest unto your Souls; so
all you persecuting Priests, People, and Professors of all sorts, come to the
Light wherewith Christ has enlightened you all, and believe in it, and obey
it, and it will open your Hearts and Understandings to know and understand that
Christ is the Light of the World, and has enlightened every one that is come
into the World, and that all that believes in that Light wherewith he has
enlightened them shall not die and perish in their Sins, but by Christ the
Light within they will come to be led out of their Sins, and so to have
Everlasting Life in him the Light: For it is written, In him was Life, and the
Life was the Light of men; and the Light will let you see, that Christ
spiritually within men and women is unto them the way to God the Father, and
the Truth, and the Life, and the Door of the Sheepfold; and if you believe in
the Light it will open your hearts to understand, that no man or woman upon the
Earth can come to get any entrance into Gods Everlasting Kingdom, but by Christ
spiritually within; for he says, I am the Light, I am the Way, I am the Truth,
I am the Life, I am the Door of the Sheepfold, he that enters by me (the Door)
shall go in and find Pasture, but he that climeth up another way is a Thief,
and must be cast down; and none can ever enter into Gods Kingdom but by Christ
spiritually within, even the same Christ which the Jews cried away withal, who
was Crucified without the Gate of Jerusalem; yea, I say, the same Christ, and
not another: I say, if ye believe in this Light, it will open your hearts to
understand these things, to your own everlasting comfort and satisfaction, and
it will give you an entrance into Gods Everlasting Kingdom; and if you do not
believe in the Light wherewith Christ has enlightened you, then you will
continue in blindness of mind, and hardness of heart, and will grow worse and
worse, deceiving, and being deceived, and you will continue fighting against
the Lord God who Created you, and you will continue fighting against the Lord
Jesus Christ in his Members, persecuting his tender and dear Servants, who are
as dear unto him as the Aple of his Eye, and if you do, it had been better for
you that you had not been born; for said he, Whosoever shall offend one of
these my little ones that believe in me, Mat 18.5, 6, 7.
it were better for him that a Misstone were hanged about his Neck, and he were
cast into the Sea; 2 Timothy 3.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13.
and if you continue in so doing, then these are the words of Truth unto you
all, you are of the same Seed and Spirit that they were of who slew the
Prophets, and Christ and the Apostles, and if you be found in the same work,
the Holy and Just God will give you the same Reward: So remember you are warned
now in your life time; Mat. 25. from verse. 32, etc. to the end.
so prize your time, and all of you labor to amend your doings; which are evil
in the sight of the Lord God, And believe in the Light, that you may be the
Children of God, who is Light, and in whom is no Darkness at all.

And now unto all people, in all Forms, who profess the Scriptures of Truth to
be your Rule to walk by, and denies the Light, Grace, and Spirit of God (which
is but one) wherewith he has enlightened you, to be a sufficient Rule or Guide
for you to walk by, and calls it a new Way, and calls it False Doctrine to
direct people to the Light within them.

I say in Coolness and true Moderation, in the Fear of the Lord God consider,
and take diligent notice of Peter's Doctrine to the Saints, Know this, said he,
that the Scriptures came not in old time by the will of man, but holy men of
God gave them forth as they were moved by the Holy Spirit, (or Ghost:) So I
say, in the Fear of the Lord God take notice, there were Holy men before there
were Holy Scriptures, and it was the Holy Spirit, or Light of God and Christ in
men that made men holy, and was their Guide and their Rule, by which they were
led and guided to do those things which did please the Lord God, before there
was any outward Writing or Printing. Abel was a Righteous man, and was beloved
of God, and was Guided and Ruled by the Spirit of God within him, before any
part of the Bible was written; and Abel offered unto the Lord, and the Lord
accepted of his Offering; but Cain was a wicked man, and a Vagabond, for he was
wandered and ravened from the Spirit of God within him; and when he was ravened
and wandered from the Spirit of God within him, and his Soul had no habitation
in God, but was a Vagabond, and his Soul delighted in Evil, Genesis 4. from verse.
5, to 17.
then in that state he offered unto the Lord God, but the Lord God did not
accept of his Offering, no, God took no pleasure at all in it, because he was
ravened from the Spirit or Light of God within him, and was wicked; and then
when Cain and his Offering was rejected, then Cain was wroth, and his
countenance fell; and the Lord said unto Cain, Why art thou Wroth? and why is
thy Countenance fallen, if thou do well, shall thou not be accepted? but if
thou do evil, sin lies at thy door: But Cain, who was full of wrath,
because he was reproved, and his Offering not accepted, he in his wrath rose up
against his righteous Brother, whom God loved, and whose Offering God accepted,
and he slew his righteous Brother, because his Brothers works were righteous,
and his own were wicked; and the Lord God cursed Cain for shedding innocent
blood; and Cain when he was ravined from the Spirit of God within him, and had
shed innocent blood, he became great in the Earth, and builded a City; and
although he had a City upon Earth, yet he was a Vagabond, because he was
wandered and ravened from the Spirit of God within him, for his Soul had no
habitation in God, but the Wrath of God did abide upon him. And now all ye
Priests and People, and Professors of all sorts, who have been, or are, or
desire to be Persecutors of those whom the Lord God loves, and takes pleasure
in, take notice of Cain's Reward, that great and first Persecutor about
Religion, and all of you repent, and give over persecuting people for the
exercise of their Consciences toward God, Or else you will undo your selves,
The Mouth of the Lord has spoken it; for whosoever persecutes any man, for the
exercise of his Conscience toward God, they are of the same Spirit with Cain,
and their Reward will be the same with his, if they do not give over
persecuting, and speedily repent; for there ought none to exercise Authority
over the Consciences of men and women but the Lord God, and his Son Jesus
Christ, (who are one,) for it is Gods Right only to Rule in and over the
Consciences of people; and what man or men soever, upon the Face of the whole
Earth, who does take upon him, or them, to lay a yoke upon the Consciences of
people, to limit people from a Worship into which they are already led by the
Spirit of the Lord God, such, who so does, they do and will provoke the Lord
God of Heaven and Earth against them, and he will bring his Wrath upon them,
and it will fall heavy upon them, 1 Cor. 12.7.
and he will bring them down, For God is a Spirit, and he has given the
manifestation of his Spirit to every one to profit withal, and every one that
believes in the measure of the Spirit of God which he has given them to
profit withal, they come by that to be led into a pure Spiritual Worship, in
which the Lord God takes pleasure, and whosoever striveth against them, the
Lord God will visit them with Judgment, and he will deliver his oppressed
people out of their hands: And so, all Persecutors, come to the Light wherewith
Christ Jesus the Son of God has enlightened you, and that will let you see
that all this while you have been perfecting a people whom God has made
harmless, for the exercise of their Conscitnces unto him in a pure Spiritual
Worship, you have been fighting against God who oreased you, as Soul was, who
was as zealous for his Form of Religion, as you are for yours, and in his blind
zeal he persecuted the Church of God, and he thought he had been doing God
service, as many of you zealous Professors have done in your bitter angry zeal,
but both his thoughts and yours have been vain in this particular; and so you
have fulfilled the words of Christ, who said unto the Saints, The time will
come that they will think they do God service that shall kill you; Joh. 16.2, 3.
but Saul was an Enemy of God, and a Fighter against God, and a Voice came unto
him from the Lord God, and the Voice said, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?
Acts 9.5.
and Saul being stricken down, answered the Voice which spoke unto him, and
said, Who art thou Lord? Acts 22.8, 19, 20.
and the Voice answered unto his question, and said, I am Jesus of Nazareth
whom thou persecutest, it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks; take
notice that Saul, (who after his Conversion was called Paul) his Conversion to
the Christian Faith was after Christ had suffered without the Gate of
Jerusalem; for Saul was going to Damascus with Letters from the high Priests,
to bring the Saints which was at Damascus to Jerusalem to be persecuted; for
Jesus Christ, the Light and Life of men he had suffered without the Gate of
Jerusalem, in that Body which his Enemies called Joseph the Carpenters Son,
before the Voice told him; I am Jesus of Nazareth whom thou persecutest: So all
Persecutors take notice, that it was Jesus in those Saints which was at
Damascus, and in other Saints, that Saul persecuted; I say it was Jesus, the
Spirit, Life and Power in those and other Saints that Saul persecuted; for, as
for the Vessel which was supposed by his Enemies to be Joseph the Carpenters
Son, that was offered up before; so Jesus Christ was in the Saints, and he was
their Comforter, the Spirit of Truth, and he did lead them into all Truth; and
the Saints were hated and persecuted both by Jews and Gentiles, who did not
believe in the Spirit and Light of Christ within them; and as it was in their
days, so it is in our days, Joh. 14.16, 17, 18, 26.
He that is born of the Flesh persecutes him that is born of the Spirit, and
they that will live Godlike in Christ Jesus must suffer persecution; Mark, they
that will live in the likeness of God, (in which state man was created) they
must suffer persecution; but if they will continue in the likeness or Image of
the Devil, in Pride, Drunkenness and Hypocrisy, and only profess God and
Christ without them, and wind and turn about unto every new Invention, which
is invented in the thick and dark Night of Apostasy, (which yet remains in, and
over, the hearts of many thousands of those that calls themselves Christians,)
then they may not be persecuted; but if they be Proud men, then they may find
some friendship amongst the Proud; Joh. 15 18, 89, 20, 21.
and if they be Drunkards, they may find some friendship amongst the Drunkards;
and if they be Hypocrites, Time-servers, and Menpleasers, and Dissemblers, then
they may find some friendship amongst the children of the same nature, for the
World loves its own: but if a man be redeemed from these things by Christ the
Light within him, and then Christ, who is Gods Power, speaks in him, and judges
and reproves the Proud for their Pride, the Drunkards for their Drunkenness,
the Covetous for their Covetousness, and the Hypocrites and Dissemblers for
their dissembling hypocrisy, then their wrath and sury rises against the man
in whom the Spirit of God speaks, and their anger is so great against the
Spirit of God, which speaks in and through the man, to reprove them for their
wickedness, that they would even break the Vessel through which the Lord God
speaks to reprove them; for Christ said unto his Disciples, before he was
Crucified, as to the outward, They shall hale you before Rulers and Magistrates
for my Name sake, but take you no thought what you shall speak, nor what you
shall say; for it is not you that speaks, but the Spirit of the Father that
speaks in you; and the Prophet said, Behold the Tabernacle of God is with
men, I will walk in them, and dwell in them, said the Lord God, I will be their
God, and they shall be my people; and Christ said before he was offered up, as
to the outward, I and my Father we will come and make our abode with you; and
the Apostle John witnessed this fulfilled when he wrote his first Epistle, which
was after Christ had suffered without the Gate of Jerusalem; John said unto the
Saints, We know that the Son of God is come, 1 John 5.19, 20.
and he has given us an understanding to know him that is true, and we are in
him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ, this is the true God and Life
Eternal: and Christ said unto his Disciples, while he was outwardly with them,
He that is with you shall be in you; and you may read in the seventeenth of
John, how Jesus prayed for the Saints, and he said unto the Father, I in them,
and thou in me, Righteous Father, that they may be one, even as we are one: O
Righteous Father, keep them in thine own Name: and now, Righteous Father, I
come unto thee, and I am no more in the World, but these are in the World, I
pray not that thou should take them out of the World, but that thou should
keep them from the evil; they are not of the World, even as I am not of the
World.

And now unto all people this we can truly say, that it is a great joy and
comfort to our Souls, that our God, by his holy Spirit in our hearts, has
redeemed us out of our vain conversation, which we for many days walked in,
after our own hearts lusts, and that he has now accounted us worthy to suffer
for his Name sake; and if you cannot love us so much now, as ye could have
done-several years ago, when many of us were walking in the Broad way that
leads unto destruction, then this is an evident token unto you, that you do not
love God who created you; for if you do love God who begets people into a holy
and righteous life and conversation, then you will love those people that are
so begotten by him; for it is written, They that love him that begets, they
love them also that are begotten of him, and we can tell you, of a truth, that
it is God who has begotten us out of that which is evil; into that which is
good, yea, he has wrought a good change in us, Glory to his Name for evermore,
for he has created us anew in Christ Jesus, the Light, in the inner Man, unto
good works, which he before ordained that we should walk in them, and as we
keep our minds stayed in the Light wherewith Christ has enlightened us) and
walks in it, it is God that works all our work in us, and for us, and we
are his Workmanship, and his Husbandry, and we are his Sheep, and he is our
Shepherd, and we do hear his Voice inwardly, in our own hearts, and he teaches
and instructs us by his good Spirit which he has given us; and we can tell
you, of a truth, that he is a good Shepherd, for he does not let us want any
thing that is good for us: And we tell you plainly we cannot forsake our God,
who is the true Shepherd of Israel who never slumbers nor sleeps, Ezekiel. 34.
from verse. 2 to 19.
to follow a stranger or a Hireling, for we have seen it, by large experience,
that when the times of the greatest danger, and the most need is, then Hireling
Shepherds flees from their Flocks; Hos. 4.9.
and if you would have us to leave and forsake the Spirit of God within us, to
follow a Hireling Priest without us, Mat: 7. from verse 15, etc. to the end.
this we cannot do, for the Lord God has let us see their deceit, and has led
us from them; and if we should turn unto them again, it had been a great deal
better for us that we had never been born: Therefore it is in vain for you to
strive to bring us to forsake Christ Jesus the true Shepherd, who lays down his
life for his Sheep, Mat. 15.13, 14.
to follow a Hireling, who loves the Fleece, but cares not for the Sheep; for
we know that they would have our outward things to live upon, and would feed
and cloth themselves therewith, but Physicians of no value we have found, and
proved, them to be; and we did adventure our Souls under their Antichristian
Ministry, for a long time, and we did expect help from them, and some of us
sought it with a great deal of diligence and zeal, and we said in our hearts,
if there be good to be had in these men, we shall have it; but though we sought
diligently in zeal to receive some good, and help, and comfort from them to
have satisfied our poor, hungry and starved Souls, we could not get it; but
when we had, with great diligence, given attention to their Airy Doctrine,
which they speak in their own will, and in their own wisdom, and in their own
time, and thought to get something to have satisfied our longing desires
withal, behold, we were like a man who in his sleep dreameth that he eats,
but when he waketh it is not so, but he is empty, and hungry, and unsatisfied;
and so have we been under the Ministry of the Priests of England, we have been
seeking Living Bread from them, for many years, and thought we should have
gotten it from them; and sometimes we thought we had been eating the true Bread
that would have satisfied our longing desires, but then we were deceived, and
it was but with us, as it is with a man that dreameth in his sleep that he
eats, but when he awaketh he is faint, and hungry, and the Living Bread we
could never get from them, for they never had it to give us, (but that we did
not know certainly until we came to believe in the Light wherewith Christ Jesus
the Son of God has enlightened us:) but now having believed in the Light, it
has opened our understandings, and we do clearly see that they have not the
Living Bread to seed upon themselves, and so has it not to deal unto others,
for we do see and know them to be proud, covetous, and envious men, and we do
see and know that the Lord God never made use of such to feed his Sheep, for
the greedy, earthly, and envious man is of the Wolvish nature, and he is is not
a fit man to be made a keeper of Gods Lambs, for he is more like to devour
them, then feed them with the Bread of Life; but now, Glory to the Lord God for
ever, he has opened an Eye within us, by which we are come to see them, and to
know them, and they cannot do any good to our Souls with their Preaching and
Praying, that we do certainly know; and so we have no need of them, for we have
no need of that which will do us no good, (but hurt;) for we are able to prove
that they do not stand in the Counsel of God, Jer. 23. from verse 21, to 32.
and therefore the people that follow them are not turned from the evil of
their ways; and they have not been sent of the Lord, therefore he has not
blessed them and their Labors; for they have been Preaching and Praying, for
many years; and it has been a frequent practice of theirs to sell their
Sermons, Hosea 6.5.
and their Prayers to those that would give the most Money for them: and when
they had been preaching unto, and praying for a People several years, and has
had from those people, it may be, One hundred pounds by the year, yet when they
have heard of, it may be, an hundred and fifty pounds to be had by the year, at
another place, then they have left their Flocks which had paid them an hundred
pounds by the year for their hire and has gone unto those that would pay them
an hundred and fifty pounds by the year for their hire; Micah 3.9, 10, 11.
and so they have shifted from one place to another to sell their preaching and
their prayers at a dear rate: and those covetous Hirelings have striven one
with another, Isa. 9.13, 14, 15, 16.
who should have that place where there was most Money to be had for their
preaching and praying; Isa 56.10, 11.
and they have gone to Law one with another to get great places (where there is
much hire) one from another: they have been bad Examples to their Flocks, they
have lived in Pride, and in Covetousness, Jer. 5.30, 31.
and in these things they do greatly abound at this time, and they are haters
and persecuters of those that fears God, Jer. 6.13, 14. and verse 10.
and are taught of God, who cannot buy their Merchandise any more: and although
such who are taught of God do deny them, and their preaching, and their
praying, Jer. 14.14, 15.
and does not come to hear them preach and pray, yet they do demand wages of
them for whom they do not work, and because such who are taught of God cannot,
not dare not give them any thing, because they know they are not sent of God,
and therefore does no good unto peoples Souls, with their praying and
preaching, (but hurt;) yet when such, who are taught of God, will not give them
hire, Ezekiel. 13. read it through.
then they Sue them at the Law, and take from them, it may be, three, or four,
or five times as much as they demanded to be their due; and thus they are more
unreasonably wicked and unlike God then any other Tradesmen: so these covetous
Tradesmen, of Great Mystery Babylon, the Mother of all Harlots, they are
altogether unlike the true Ministers of Christ, which he sent forth, who said
unto them, Freely you have received, freely give; Mat. 10.8, 9. etc. to the end
of the Chapter.
and they did as Christ commanded them, and they went into the Towns, and
Cities, and Countries, and Nations, to enquire who had a desire after the
Knowledge of God, and who was willing to receive the Kingdom of God; and they
preached the Gospel freely without Money, and without Price, yea, without the
price of One hundred pounds by the year; yea, the Ministers of Christ in former
Ages, and the Ministers of Christ in this Age, fulfilled, and does fulfill that
which the Spirit of God in Isaiah the Prophet called for, when he said, O come
ye to the Waters, Isa. 55. from verse 1, to 10.
come, buy Milk and Wine without Money, and without Price: why will ye spend
your Money for that which is not Bread, and your labor for that which
satisfies not: I say, the Apostles and Ministers of Christ in their days
preached freely without money, and without price, and they brought people to
the Free Gift of God in themselves, to the anointing which was in them, which
was sufficient to teach them, Rev. 22.17 1 John 22.27, 28, 29. and verse. 26.
and they needed no man to teach them, but as the same anointing did teach
them: and this Testimony which John the Minister of Christ did bear was truth
and no lie; and Paul who was a Minister of Christ, he brought people to the
Free Gift of God in them, he turned their minds from the darkness which was in
them, unto the Light of Christ in them, which was the free gift of God unto
them, given unto them to teach them; and Paul the Minister of Christ, he said,
The Grace of God that brings Salvation has appeared unto all men, Tit. 2.11,
12.
and it taught him, and the rest of the Saints who had believed in it, to deny
and forsake that which was unlike God, and (when they lived in it, made them
unlike God), worldly Lusts; and this free Grace of God taught them to live in
the likeness of God, in which likeness man was created; and Paul when he writ
unto the Saints, he did commit them to God, Act. 26, 18.
and the Word of his Grace which was in their hearts, which he said was able to
build them up, and give them an inheritance; and Paul said, Ephesians. 2. read it
through.
By Grace ye are saved, and not of your selves, for it is the Gift of God, and
we say the same, if people believe in the Grace, and obey it, then it saves
them from their Sins, and so they are saved not by their own works, but by the
free Grace of God which brings Salvation, which has appeared unto all men;
but if they do not believe in the Grace, then they are not saved by it, but it
is their condemnation: and Jude in his Epistle says, the Wicked turn the Grace
of God into Laciviousness, and so denied the only true God, Jude 4.
and our Lord Jesus Christ. Now Professors, of all sorts, consider, they could
not have turned the Grace of God into Laciviousness, if it had not been
manifest in them, and unto them; but it was manifest in them, and they rebelled
against it, and therefore it was their condemnation: though they talked of God
and Christ with their mouths, and profess God and Christ in words, yet in
works they did deny both God and Christ, and so does all in this Age who rebel
against the Grace of God in them: Peter the Minister of Christ, he told the
Saints, 2 Pet. 1.19
that they had a moro sure Word of Prophecy, (then that which was heard in the
Mount) whereunto they did well if they took heed, us unto a Light that shines
in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the Day Star arise in your hearts. Now
People take notice, that the dark place where the Light did shine, which people
was to take heed unto, was within people; for, said he, you do well that you
take heed unto the Light which shines in the dark place, until the day dawn,
and the Day Star arise in your hearts; so when they did believe in the Light,
and take heed unto the Light, then the day did dawn in their hearts; but when
they did not believe in the Light, nor take heed unto it, then the thick night
of darkness was in and over their hearts, For God called the Light Day, 1 Thessalonians. 5.7. and verse. 3, 4, 5, 6, 8.
and the Darkness he called Night; so all who do evil they do it in the Night,
in the Darkness, when they are ravined from the Light, the free Gift of God
within them: but Peter, the Minister of Christ, he brought people to the Light
of the free Gift of God in them; and so we the Servants and Ministers of
Christ, we do direct people to the Light and Grace of God in them, which is
Gods Gift unto them to profit withal; and we the Servants of Christ do speak
that freely unto people, which we have freely and immediately received from the
Lord God to speak unto them, and it does not cost us any Money, for the Gift of
God cannot be bought nor sold for Money; for Simon Magus, the Sorcerer, when he
perceived the Gift and Power of God which was with Peter and the rest of the
Ministers of Christ, he would have given them Money that he might have had the
some Power, but Peter said unto him, Thy Money perish with thee, thou have
neither part nor lot in this matter, because thou have thought that the Gift of
God might be bought for Money; so the Ministers of Christ in former Ages did
not sell the Gift which God had given them for Money, but judged and reproved
Simon, who would have given them Money for the Gift of God: And the Servants or
Ministers, now at this day, who have received a Gift from God, and a Command
from God to speak unto people, they do not sell the Gift which God has given
unto them for Money, nor any other Earthly thing, nor their Words which they do
speak from the Gift or Spirit of God within them, they do not sell for Money,
nor for any Earthly thing; and so in this they are like unto the Ministers of
Christ in the Ages past: and as the Ministers of Christ, in the Ages past, did
direct people to the Light within, the Grace within, Joh. 1.1, 2, etc. to verse
13.
the Spirit within, the Word within, and the Anointing within, which was to
guide them and lead them into all Truth; so the Ministers of Christ in this Age
does direct people to the Light within, Grace within, Spirit within, Anointing
within, and the Word within, Deuteronomy. 30.14.
which was in the Beginning, that they may hear it in their own hearts, and be
obedient unto it: And as the Ministers of Christ in former Ages lived a
Godlike, Sober, and Holy life, and lived in the good they exhorted others to
come into, and also lived out of the evil that they reproved others for; so the
Ministers of Christ at this day, by the same Spirit of God within them, are
kept in a holy Godlike life, and they are in the good they exhort others to
come into, and they live out of the evil that they reprove others for, and in
this they are like unto the Ministers of Christ in the former Age: and the
Ministers of Christ, now in this Age, are good examples unto those people unto
whom they preach the Gospel, and unto all people who sees them, Glory, yea,
glory to the Lord God for ever, for it is his Work, and it glorifies him, and
he is worthy for ever, even so Amen for ever. But the Hirelings, whom God never
sent, nor commanded to preach, who run and intrude themselves to be Teachers
for Hire, for their Belleys, they say unto their Followers, be not proud, and
they themselves are proud; and they say unto their Followers, be not covetous,
and they themselves are the most coveteous men that be upon the Earth, their
Fruits does make them manifest; for they do make it their frequent practice to
force Wages from those they do no work for; and I do not know any Tradesman in
this Nation, of any other Trade, that will demand, or force Wages from those
they do no work for, but only the Hireling Priests, and the Officers of that
bad Trade: And the Hirelings says, be not Envious, and they themselves are
Envious, and so they are out of the good they exhort others to come into, and
they are in the evil that they reprove others for, and so their Doctrine is of
no Authority, and it is not worth heeding; for it has no power in it to kill
Sin, nor to cast him out of people, who is the Power, and Author, and Root of
Sin, which is the Devil; and so they are Hypocrites who judges their Followers
for doing evil, and they themselves are doing the same evil: for Christ said
that he was a Hypocrite who said unto his Brother, Let me pull the Moat one of
thine Eye, and he had not first pulled the Beam out of his own Eye; Mat. 7.3,
4, 5.
and Christ said he was a Hypocrite who judged another, Romans 2.1, 2, 3.
and acted the same things himself: And this I say in the Name and Power of the
Lord God, that there is many thousands of those people who follows the Hireling
Priests, who are more naturally honest, and are of a better understanding to
receive the things of the the Spirit of God, then the Hireling Priests who are
their Teachers; but God will gather them out from them, and will teach them
himself, freely, by his own Spirit in their own hearts: Some of the Hireling
Priests have been heard to say, to their Followers, do not as we do, but do as
we say; now this is clearly contrary to the Doctrine of the Apostle, who said
unto them that followed him, Walk as you have us for an Example, and follow us,
1 Cor. 11.1. Phil. 5.17, 18, 19. 1 Thessalonians. 1.6, 7. 1 Pet. 5.1, 2, 3, 4.
as we follow Christ, (speaking of himsef and the rest of the Ministers of
Christ) he did not bid them do as he said, and not as he did, for he had no
need to say so, for his Conversation and Doctrine was agreeable: The Apostle
Peter, when he writ unto the Elders, he said unto them, Feed the Flock of God
which are amongst you, not taking the Oversight thereof by Constraint, but
willingly; let all people that reads take notice of those words, the Elders
were not to take the Oversight of the Flock, by constraint but willingly; now
the reason why Peter did write these words unto them, was, because there was
not any outward Gift or Reward to be given unto them, for their Feeding and
taking Care for the Flock of God, for it was a Spiritual Work, and it was to
have a Spiritual Reward; so lest any, through the temptation of the Enemy of
their Souls, should have striven to put that from them, that God required of
them, Peter warned them; then the next following words are these, Not for
filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; now filthy lucre, is much Earthly gain ill
gotten, but the Elders were not to take the oversight of the Flock of God for
outward gain, but as being of a ready mind, and a willing mind to serve God in
what he required of them, yea, to feed his Sheep with the Bread of Life, which
God gave unto them; and the Elders were not to be Lords over Gods Flock, which
he had made them Overseers of, but they were to be Examples to the Flock, and
they were good Examples to the Flock, and they did not say as some of the
Hirelings have said, Do as we say, and not as we do, for they had no need to
say so, for their Conversation and Doctrine was agreeable, and so is the
Doctrine and Conversation of the Elders and Ministers of Christ in this Age,
Glory to the Lord God for ever.

Now if there were a young Priest that had learned his Trade at Oxford or
Cambridge, who wanted a place to set up his Trade in, if one should come unto
him, and tell him of three or four places, one of One hundred pounds by the
year, and another of Two, and another of Three, and another of Four, and bid
him choose which of those he would go unto, one may easily know which he would
choose, for he would be where he could get most with his Trade, and he need not
be constrained to go unto a Parish where he might have Four hundred pounds in
the year for his Hire, 1 Thessalonians. 2.9.
but he would make great have to get unto it, lest another of his own Trade
should get it before him; and this is contrary to those Ministers which Christ
sent forth. Paul, who was a Tentmaker, when he was a Minister of the Gospel,
labored with his own hands, and administered unto his own necessities, that he
might make the Gospel without charge; and Peter and John, and the rest of the
Ministers of the Gospel, some were Fishermen, and some of other callings, and
they Labored with their hands, yet they had power to eat and to drink for the
refreshment of their Bodies, when they did travel up and down among the Saints
who were gathered by their Ministry; but they were often in Hunger, and Cold,
and Fastings, and Peril by Sea and Land; and were often whipped, stocked, and
imprisoned; and they had not a Parish, and a hundred pound in the year, and an
outward Law to guard them, as the Hireling Priests have.

And now all ye Magistrates, both high and low, and all people, in what Form of
Religion soever, think it not strange that we cannot come unto the
Steeple-house, and hear your Priest; Preach and Pray, seeing that they are so
far different from the Ministers of Christ, every way; so that they are no more
like the Ministers which Christ sent forth (in nature) then a Wolf is like a
Lamb.

And now all Magistrates and People, of what form of Religion soever, who
profess the Scriptures to be your Rule, and denies the Light, Spirit and Grace
of God within you, which convinces you of Sin, to be a sufficient Guide, of it
self, to lead you out of Sin, whether you be such as own those Priests and
their Practice, which I have written something in short against, or whether you
be such as do deny them, and are gathered into some other Form differing from
them, if you set the Scriptures in the Place of the Spirit of God, which made
men holy before any Scriptures were written, and from which the holy men spoke
forth the holy Scriptures, then with you is my controversy on the behalf of
the Lord my God.

So come to your Trial, and be you tried by that which you call your own Rule,
the Holy Scriptures, which was given forth from and by the Holy Spirit; so the
Holy Spirit of God is the Original of the Holy Scriptures; therefore I, and all
my faithful Brethren and Sisters do know them, and love them, and believe them.

Abel was a Righteous man before the Scriptures were written, and he in the
Spirit of God had his Habitation, and by it he was kept pure before God; and in
the Purity of his heart, and Innocence of his Soul he offered unto God, and God
had respect unto his Offering: And Enoch walked with God in the Spirit, in
Innocence, before the Scriptures were written: And Abraham knew God, who is a
Spirit, and believed in him before Scriptures were written: Isaac and Jacob had
acquaintance with God before the Scriptures were written; for these men were
before Moses was born; and Moses knew God before he did write Scriptures; No
man knows the things of God, but the Spirit of God, and the Spirit searches
all things, even the deep things of God; and these men did know the things that
God did require of them in their Generation, by the Spirit of God, and in the
same they did perform that which was required of them, in which they were
accepted of God in their Generation: And all the Prophets and Apostles, who did
write the holy Scriptures, they did know God before they did write Scriptures,
and it is the same that ever it was, that does give unto man the knowledge of
God, and of his things, (even the Spirit of God.)

But in the Bible, which you call your Rule, there is an express Command of
God, Thou shall Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, Mat. 19.19.
and thy Neighbor as thy self; these words are written in the Bible, which you
call your Rule; now to the Witness of God, Mark 12.29, 30, 31.
the Light of Christ in all your Consciences do I appeal, Whether do you love
the Lord God with all your hearts, and your Neighbors as your selves, yea or
nay? You that persecutes your Neighbors, because they will not be of your
Religion, and come to your Steeple Houses, and hear your Hireling Priests, and
pay them Tithes, which was never demanded by any of Christ's Ministers; no, the
Ministers and Apostles of Christ did never demand nor receive any Tithes at
all, for the Tithes were ordained for the Tribe of Levi, Neh. 10.38
who were to serve in the Outward Temple, who were the Outward Priesthood, who
had not any part in the division of the Land; for the other Tribes had the Land
divided amongst them, Number. 18.20, 22, etc. to the end Chapter.
but the Tribe of Levi had no part of the Land, but, as I said before, the
Tithes was for to relieve them, and not only them, but the Strangers and
Fatherless also, that there might not be a Beggar in Israel; but this was
before Christ, the Everlasting High Priest, was made manifest, as to the
outward; but when he was come, and was offered up, then Stephen, a man full of
Faith, and full of the Power of God, he lift up his voice in the Power of the
Everlasting High Priest, and said, God that made the World dwells not in Temples
made with hands, but the Temple-worshippers they were filled with wrath against
him, for his true Testimony, and they stoned him to death: And Paul in the
Power of the Everlasting High Priest, he said unto the Saints, Heb. 3.1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6.
That their Bodies were the Temple of the Living God; and when Paul writ unto
the Hebrews, he told them, that the Priesthood being changed, Heb. 7.12, to the
end of the chapter.
there was also a necessity of the change of the Law: So the Ministers of
Christ, in the Power of him, the Everlasting High Priest, they preached down
the outward Temple, and its Worship, and its Priests, and all their Sacrifices,
which made nothing perfect, Heb. 10 11, 20, 21, 22.
as pertaining to the Conscience; and so the Priests, and Temple, and Tithes
was but to continue till Christ was offered up; and though they did uphold the
outward Temple worship, and its Priests, and Tithes, for some time after Christ
was offered up, and so slew Stephen and others for crying against it, yet the
Arm of the Lord God was against them, and it brought them down, and the
Foundation of their Temple was pulled up, and they were scattered up and down
in many Nations, and are so scattered unto this day, according unto the
Prophecy of Christ Jesus the Everlasting High Priest, Acts 7.47, 48, 49, 50,
59, 60.

And now unto all people I say, 2 Samuel 7.5, 6, 12, 13. 1 Kings 6.1, 2.
there was never any outward House, or Temple, that Gods Worship was limited
to, but only that at Jerusalem, which David prepared for, and Solomon builded;
neither was there ever any command from God to pay Tithes unto any other
Priests, but only those who belonged to that Worship under the Law, and the
Command was but in force until Christ was Crucified without the Gate of
Jerusalem, Joh. 4.20, etc. to ver. 27.
and that was many hundred years ago, and the Scriptures of Truth, which the
Priests of England do call their Rule, do prove what I have written concerning
this thing.

And O ye Priests of England, you have no command from God to take Tithes, and
therefore you have no right to Tithes; and there is a People of a tender
Conscience in this Nation, whom you in scorn call Quakers, God has opened
their Eyes, and they see and know you have no right to Tithes; and therefore in
obedience unto Christ Jesus the Everlasting High Priest, 1 Cor. 3.16, 17.
who has ended the outward Temple, and outward Priests, and Law, and Tithes,
they have withheld their own from you, 2 Cor. 6.16.
and durst not give you any Tithes; for if they had, then they had provoked the
Lord God unto wrath against them; and for this their tender obedience unto
their God, you have persecuted several of them, your Neighbors unto death; and
thus you have brought innocent blood upon your selves, for which you must drink
deep of the Cup of Gods fierce Indignation; Isa. 49.25, 26.
and you do still continue your Cruelty, in imprisoning the Bodies, and
spoiling the Goods of those your Neighbors, and you have not yet repented of
those your grievous Sins, neither do you seek Repentance for those your
grievous Sins; for if you were sorrowful for what you have done, in those
things which you have done, then you would give over so doing; but the most of
you, who have power given you by men, you continue in your wicked works; Phil.
3 18, 19.
and as the Apostle said, Your Consciences are Seared, as with a hot Iron, and
you have sold your selves Slaves unto Satan to do his work with greediness, for
his Servants your are to whom you obey, and in those things you obey Satan; for
he was a Liar, and a Murderer from the beginning, and his Children and
Servants are like him; and these your wicked works which you have done, it has
been for your Bellies, which you make your god: and though you have been
professing the true God in words, yet you have not known him, for your hearts
have been far from him; and though you have talked of him with your Mouths
(for Money,) yet in works you have denied him, and so you have not loved the
Lord God with all your hearts, and so you could not love your Neighbors, the
People you call Quakers, as you have loved your selves: for if you had loved
the Lord God with all your hearts, then you would have loved your Neighbors as
your selves; for before any man or woman can come to love their Neighbors as
themselves, they must come to love the Lord God with all their hearts; but you
have loved your Bellies more then you have done either God or your Neigbours,
your Fruits do make it plainly manifest, many thousands of Englands Inhabitants
sees it to be so; therefore you are not Ruled by the holy Scriptures without
you, nor by the holy Spirit, which is the Original of the Scriptures, (within
you,) but you are unruly, and the holy Spirit of God in your own Consciences,
and the holy Scriptures without you do bear witness against you, and you stand
judged and condemned before the Lord God, and all just and holy men: And Christ
Jesus spoke words, which was written, and is upon Record in the Holy
Scriptures, which you call your Rule; he said unto the people, Whatsoever ye
would that men should do unto you, do you even so unto them, this is Christ's
Command; and he says, If you love me, keep my Commandments, and if you did
love him you would keep this his Command; He that says he knows, or loves
God, and keeps not his Commandments is a Liar, 1 John 2.4. If any man say he
loves God, and hates his Brother, he is a Liar: for he that loves not his
Brother, whom he has seen, how can he love God, whom he has not seen: And
this Commandment have we from him, that he that loves God, loves his Brother
also, 1 John 4.20.21. By this we know that we love the Children of God, when we
love God, and keep his Commandments: For this is the love of God, that we keep
his Commandments, and his Commandments are not grievous, 1 John 5.2, 3.

And now, Oh ye Magistrates, Priests, and People, who have persecuted, and
imprisoned until death your Neighbors, called Quakers, and spoiled, and made
havoc of their Goods, here you have broken the commands of Christ, which is
upon Record in the holy Scriptures of Truth, which you call your Rule, and
everlasting Woe will come upon you, if you do not speedily repent, and with
speed forsake those evil deeds; for it is written in the Scriptures of Truth,
Woe unto thee that spoilest, and thou wast not spoiled, and I know we have not
spoiled your goods, nor sought your hurt any way, but has, and still does
desire that you might repent, and forsake the evil of your ways, and have your
Sins forgiven you, and obtain mercy from the Lord God; we desire not your
destruction, the Lord God knows, but we desire that you might repent, and
live: But the words of Christ in the holy Scriptures bears witness against you,
that you have not done unto us, as ye would we should have done unto you, if
you had been in our condition, and we in yours, you would not have had us to
have imprisoned you unto death, as you have done many of our dear Brethren,
whose innocent blood lies upon you, and it cries unto God against you for
vengeance, as righteous Abel's did cry unto God against Murdering Cain; and
God does hear, and will avenge the blood of his Elect: And you would not have
had us to have spoiled your goods, as you have done ours; therefore the
Scriptures of Truth without you, and the Light of Christ within you does bear
witness against you: And now you are stripped of all your Coverings, and you
stand judged and condemned before the Lord God of Heaven, before whom all
things are naked and bare, he searches all hearts, Ezekiel. 18 read it through
and tries all reins, and there is not any wicked work that you do, or have
done, but the Lord God sees them all, and they must not go unpunished, for the
Lord God is just and equal in all his ways, and he will deal justly with you,
and with all people upon the Earth, yea, he will certainly reward every one
according to their deeds done in the body, whether they be good or evil: And
Christ's words are upon Record in the holy Scriptures, which you call your Rule,
where he commanded his Disciples to love their Enemies, Mat. 5 43, 44, 45, 46,
47, 48.
and to do good unto those that did dispitefully use them, and persecute them,
and they did as he commanded them, for they loved him with all their hearts,
and his Commandments were not grievous unto them, but to keep his Commandments
was great joy unto them, and so it is unto us, whom you in scorn call Quakers,
endless, infinite, eternal, everlasting praises, honor, dominion and thanks be
unto the Lord our God, who has gathered us out from amongst you, and by his
own everlasting power, working in our hearts, he has made us a willing people,
yea, willing to bear all that you are permitted to do unto us, and also makes
us willing to do you any good that lies in our power, and so to reward you
good for evil, and this shall add to your torment; and our God, for whom we
suffer, he will clear our innocence in the sight of all Nations.

But you are far from fulfilling of this Command, who hates, and persecutes us,
who are your friends, and so these words which Christ spoke, which is in the
holy Scriptures, which you call your Rule, bears witness against you, and the
Light of Christ within you condemns you, and so you are stripped of all your
Coverings, and so you stand judged and condemned by the Lord God, in the
presence of all holy, just and upright men, who sees and behold your wicked
works.

And now all ye Merchant men, Husbandmen, and Tradesmen, of what Trade or
Calling soever, who are Extortioners, who take unlawful gain, and use unjust
Weights and Measures, who cheat and defraud one another in Buying, and Selling,
and Exchanging of Gods good Creatures, some of you lying, and speaking worse of
Gods good Creatures then you know them to be, for your own corrupt ends, that
you may make a prey upon them that has those good Creatures to sell; and
others of you that has Gods Creatures to sell, you speak better of them then
you know them to be, and so you tell lies to get gain, and so to make a prey of
the Buyer; and here you are judged and condemned by the Light of Christ within
you, and by his words which are upon Record in the holy Scriptures of Truth
without you, which you call your Rule, because you do not do unto others, as ye
would they should do unto you, and you do not love the Lord God with all your
hearts, and therefore you cannot love your Neighbor as your self: therefore
those words, with many more, in the holy Scriptures bears witness against you,
and the Light of Christ within you condemns you; so you are neither Ruled by
the Light of Christ within you, nor by the Scriptures of Truth without you, and
so you are unruly.

Therefore I say unto you all, turn in your minds unto the Eternal true Light
wherewith Christ Jesus has enlightened you all, and if you love it, it will
work repentance in your hearts, and if you give up your minds to be led by it,
it will lead you out of all deceit, and double dealing, and if you love it, and
in faithfulness follow and obey it, it will lead you to love your Neighbors as
your selves; and then, I am sure, you neither can, nor will, nor dare cheat nor
defraud them, but then you will do unto them, as you would they should do unto
you; and I am sure, there is no man that would be cheated nor defrauded by any
man that he deals withal, in buying, and selling, and exchanging Gods good
Creatures; and so let every man and woman come to the Light wherewith Christ
has enlightened them, and as they would have none to cheat nor defraud them,
the Light of Christ will not suffer them to cheat, nor deceive, nor defraud any
man, or woman, or child whatsoever, if they love it, and in faithfulness follow
it; for the Light is the Spirit of Truth, which leads into all Truth all
those that believe in it, and in faithfulness follow it; and so if all people
would come unto the Light wherewith Christ has enlightened them, then it would
lead them all to deal justly, plainly, truly and uprightly one with another.

But, alas, this pure Light and Spirit in peoples Consciences is not loved, nor
heeded, nor believed, nor obeyed by many thousands of men and women, who does
profess God and Christ in words, and calls the Scripture their Rule; and that
is the reason that there is so much cheating and defrauding amongst people in
buying, and selling, and exchanging of Gods good Creatures; and that is the
cause that there is so much robbing and stealing Gods good Creatures one from
another; and that is the cause there is so much hanging and killing one another
about Gods good Creatures; and that is the cause that there is so much hanging,
and burning, and killing one another about Religion, even because people do not
believe in, and obey the Light wherewith Christ Jesus the Son of God has
enlightened them; and until the inhabitants of England, and all Nations, come
unto the Light wherewith Christ Jesus the Son of God has enlightened every one
that is come into the World, and believe in, and obey it, they will never come
to be established in Peace, nor to have the Blessing of God, nor to inherit the
Kingdom of God: but while they are Rebellious against the Light of Christ in
them, there will come Judgments and Plagues one after another, and there shall
be no peace to the Wicked, who continue in Rebellion against the Light
wherewith Christ has enlightened them, neither in this World, nor in that
which is to come: and these are the words of Truth from the Lord God, unto all
people, which shall stand a Witness for the Lord God against all who do
continue in Rebellion against the Light; and I do declare, in the Name of the
Lord God, that it is the great Misery of all Nations, both Jews and Gentiles,
Turk and Pope, and all other Nations whatsoever, that they do not believe in
the Light wherewith Christ has enlightened every one that is come into the
World; for if all people, in all Nations, would come to the Light wherewith
Christ has enlightened them, which convinces them of Sin, then the Light
would reconcile all differences amongst them, yea, it would reconcile them all
together, and it would make them of one heart, and of one mind; but they being
out from the Light, they are of many minds, and they are striving one with
another who shall be the greatest; and they are warring one with another, and
killing one another for Earthly Crowns, and Earthly Honor, and Earthly Riches,
and also about their Idolatrous Worship, and their many Babilonish Religions:
Now the Apostle said, Jam. 4.1, etc. to ver. 11.
From whence comes Wars and Fightings, come they not even from your Lusts; so
now if all Nations would come to the Light wherewith Christ has enlightened
them, then they would feel power shed abroad in their hearts, in the light, to
cut down the Lust in them all, Jam. 5.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
from which all Wars does arise, For if we walk in the Light as he is in the
Light, then have we fellowship one with another, and the Blood of Jesus Christ
his Son cleanses us from all sin, 1 John 1.7. And so if the Light were loved,
and followed, it would cut down the Lust from which Wars does arise, and Pride
does arise, and Covetousness, and Envy does arise; for Pride in the heart, and
Covetousness in the heart, and Envy in the heart is the causes which makes
people break forth into Wars and Fightings one against another, and so to kill
and destroy one another; now Christ Jesus the great Prophet, whom Moses said
all was to hear and obey, he said, Love your Enemies, do good unto those that
dispitefully use you, and persecute you, and he said, Put up thy Sword into its
sheath, Mat. 26.51, 52, 53. Rev. 13.10
for he that smites with the Sword, shall perish with the Sword; you
Carnal-weaponed men, who are wrestling with Flesh and Blood, and are killing of
you Fellow Creatures, either for their Religion, or for their Earthly things,
though you may not be slain by a Carnal Sword, as you have slain others, yet if
you do not come to the Light of Christ within you, and repent, and give over
killing about Religion, and about Earthly Honor, and Earthly Crowns, then the
great Sword of the Lord God Almighty, which proceeds out of his Mouth, will cut
you down, and you will perish by it, and be cast into the Lake that burns for
ever: Christ Jesus when he was manifest upon the Earth among the Sons of men,
he said unto them, Think ye that I came to bring Peace upon the Earth, I tell
you nay, but a Sword: now you Carnal-weaponed men, this Sword which he sent
upon the Earth, it was not like your Carnal Sword, which kills the Creatures in
their Sins; but the Sword which Christ sent upon the Earth, it was a Spiritual
Sword, which did enter into the hearts of the wicked, and it did cut down the
Sin, and so redeemed the Creature out of the Bondage of Sin, from under the
Power of him who is the Author of Sin, which is the Devil; and so Christ's
Sword which he brought upon the Earth, it did not kill the Creature, but it
killed the Sin, and so brought the Creature into a glorious Liberty, out of
Bondage to Sin, and so into the glorious Liberty of the Sons of God.

So all you Carnal-weaponed men, come to the Light wherewith Christ Jesus the
Son of God has enlightened you all, that so in the Light you may all come to
know and feel that Spiritual Sword to enter into your hearts, and to take Peace
from the Wicked One within you, and so to kill the Sin in you, and cast him out
of you, who is the Strong Man, even the Man of Sin, who is the Prince of the
Power of the Air, who rules in the hearts of you Children of Disobedience, who
disobeys the Light wherewith Christ has enlightened you, that so the Sword of
the Spirit may have its way through all your unclean hearts, that you may come
to know Cains nature to perish in you, by the Spiritual Sword, even that nature
in you, which slew Righteous Abel, that your Souls may be saved in the day of
the Lord.

Christ never owned Carnal-weaponed men to Fight for his Kingdom, Isa. 2.4.
for though some offered to Fight for him, that he might not have been
delivered unto the Jews, yet he judged and denied them in that thing, and he
said, If my Kingdom were of this World, then would my Servants Fight; but his
Kingdom was not, nor is not of this World, therefore his Servants in former
Ages were forbidden to Fight for him with Carnal weapons; and his Servants in
this Age, who are in scorn called Quakers, they are bound by the Eternal Spirit
of the Lord God Almighty, never to Fight for Christ's Kingdom, with Carnal
weapons; for the Lord God Eternal he will Fight for it with and by the Breath
of his Mouth, by which he slew his Enemies, heaps upon heaps, in the Ages past;
Rev. 19.15, 16. and verse. 13, 14. Acts 12.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 21, 22.
and in this Age the Everlasting God he has made ready his great and strong
Sword, yea, he has made it sharp, and he is laying it upon Leviathan that
crooked Serpent, and he will slay the Dragon that plays in the Sea; yea, he
will dry up the Sea, for he has cursed all her Springs; these are those Waters
which are gathered together, on which the Great Whore does sit; 2 Cor. 10.4, 5.
but the Waters are drying up, and as the Waters dry up, the Whores Torment
increases, and it is increasing more and more, yea, God is casting her upon a
Bed of Torment, and those that have committed Fornication with her; and the
Beast that rose out of the Earth is God judging, with that which rose out of
the Sea also, and the Dragon, Beasts, and False Prophet, and Whore must be cast
into the Lake that burns for ever and ever; he that has an Ear to hear, let
him hear: Babylon the City of Confusion is going to decay daily, and her
Children are dying daily, and her tall and stately Buildings are tumbling down
apace, and her Desolation is coming on swiftly, for strong is the Lord God who
judges her, (the Light) which she and her Children has hated, is gloriously
shining out of Darkness, and as it arises it makes more and more bare her
Skirts, and the Everlasting Day is dawning in the hearts of the Sons and
Daughters of men, and this Everlasting Day will give people a true Spiritual
seeing, feeling, tasting and handling, and they shall be more Heavenly and
Spiritually wise then they have been in the thick Night of Darkness and
Apostasy, in which men have slept, and committed Fornication with the Whore,
and have been made drunk with her Cup of Fornication; in the night while men
sleep their Senses are benumned, and they are dreaming that they have a thing,
or sees a thing, but when they are awakened, then they recover their true
sense, and then they know that they have not the thing that they dreamed they
had; for the Everlasting Day of God it declares all things as they be.

But come to further Trial all wicked people, who profess the Scriptures to be
your Rule, Obad. 3 4. Isa 28.1. Psalm. 10.1, etc. to verse 12. Psalm. 73.6, 7, 8.
Prove. 16.17, 18, 19. Prove. 29.23. Jam. 4.6. Job 26.12. Pro. 16.5. Pro. 15.25
Pro. 21.4. Mal. 4.1.
and denies the Light wherewith Christ has enlightened you.

Come you Proud and Lofty ones, come to your Trial, these words are written in
the Scriptures, as follows: Woe to the Crown of Pride, God resists the Proud,
God beholds the Proud afar off, Pride goes before Destruction; Mark, Pride
goes before, and Destruction follows, and the High-mind before a fall; these
Scriptures without you, and the Light of Christ within you condemns you; you
are not Ruled by the Scriptures without you, nor by the Light within you, and
so you are unruly; your Covering is to narrow, it will not cover you, but you
are stripped: therefore behold your Nakedness, and come to the Light, and
repent, and be humbled by the Judgments of God.

You Covetous, Carnal, and Earthly minded ones, come to your Trial: It is
written in the holy Scriptures, Romans 8.6, 7. 1 Cor. 2.14.
To be Carnal-minded is Death, and the Carnal Mind is Enmity against God, and
the Carnal Mind cannot receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are as
foolishness to the Carnal Mind; Covetousness is Idolatry, and the love of Money
is the Root of all Evil: so these words, with many more, in the holy Scriptures
bears witness against you, and the Light within you is your Condemnation, and
you are left without a Covering; therefore turn unto the Light, and repent.

And you Malicious, Envious and Blood-thirsty ones, come to your Trial: 1 John
3.15.
It is written, He that hates his Brother is a Murderer, and no Murderer
has Eternal Life abiding in him; and Cain was an Envious man, and slew his
Brother, and Haman was a Proud and Envious man, and Gods Wrath and Judgments
came upon them: Mat. 5.44, 45, 46, 47, 48.
and Christ said, Love your Enemies, do as you would that others should do unto
you, Love your Neighbors as your Selves, Render no man Evil for Evil, but
overcome Evil with Good; and remember how you use to pray, (Forgive us our
Trespasses, as we forgive them that Trespass against us,) and Christ said, If
you forgive not men their Trespasses, neither will God forgive you your
Trespasses; and the Lord God said, Vengeance is mine, and I will repay it: and
so you that are envying, and hating, and taking revenge, and will not forgive
one another, all your Prayers are a Stink, and loathsome and abominable unto the
Lord God, and he is grieved at you, that you do presume to pray unto him with
such wicked and envious hearts: Psalm. 66.17, 18, 19.
the Prophet said, If I regard Iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear my
Prayer: so these Scriptures without you, and the Light of Christ within you
bears witness against you, and so you are stripped off all your Coverings, and
nothing shall be able to deliver you from the Wrath of the Lamb, the Light:
therefore while you have a little time prize it, and come to the Light, Mat.
5.14, 15. Pro. 10.7.
and own its Judgments, and turn at its Reproofs, from the Evil it reproves you
for, that so the Lord God may have mercy on you, and forgive your Trespasses
which you have Trespassed against him, and that you may receive Power from him
to forgive one another; and if you do not, you will perish, The Mouth of the
Lord has spoken it.

And now, O ye Drunkards, come to your Trial: It is written in the holy
Scriptures, Isa. 5.22. and verse. 20. Pro. 23.30, 31. Isa. 28.1. Joel 1.5. Lu.
21.34. Romans 13.13, 14. Gal. 5.19, to the end.
That the name of the Wicked shall Rot, and Woe unto them that are strong to
drink Wine, and rise betime to drink Strong Drink, Woe to the Drunkards who is
as a fading Flower, Awake ye Drunkards and weep and howl, The Drunkards and
Glutions shall come to Poverty; these Scriptures, with many more, bears witness
against you, and hear you may read your condemnation in that which you call
your Rule: But oh you Beastly ill-carriaged men and women, you have a Condemner
nearer you then these Scriptures without you, that is the Light wherewith
Christ has enlightened you, if you did love that, it would Rule and Govern you
all, it would not let you take more of Gods Creatures, either to eat or drink,
then what is truly necessary; but you are ravened from that, and so you have no
good Government, but you are more loathsome then common Beasts; for the Ox and
the Horse knows when they have enough, and is satisfied therewith, and they
are better governed then you; therefore come to to the Light wherewith Christ
has enlightened you all, wait in it, and cross, and famish, and starve, and
pine your own ungodly Lusts, and take and use Gods good Creatures in his
Wisdom, with moderation, that God may forgive you your Sins which is past, and
may guide and rule you better for time to come, then you have been in that time
which you have already spent; God does not desire your Destruction, but would
have you to come unto his Light in all your Consciences, that he might govern
and rule you all by that; for without that you cannot govern nor rule your
selves.

And now all ye Liars, Swearers, Mockers, Scoffers, Vain-Talkers, and
Idle-Jesters, Whoremongers, and Adulterers, and all you who delight in
Laughter, which is Madness, and in vain and ungodly Songs, with Music, and
Chambering, and wanton Lusts, come to your Trial: The Devil was, and is a Liar,
Joh 8.44. Rev. 21.8. Rev. 22.15 Hosea 4.2. Jer. 9.3.
and every Lie that any of you tell, the Devil is the Author of it, and he
leads you into it, and all those that loves and makes Lies are shut out of the
Kingdom of God: And all you Mockers and Scoffers, it is written, That Abraham
had two Sons, the one by a Bondwoman, and the other by the Freewoman Sarah,
Genesis 21.9, 10, 11, 12.
the Mother of the Faithful; Sarahs Son was Isaac, and the Son of Hagar, the
Bondwoman, was Ishmael; and Ishmael the Bond-womans Son, he mocked and scoffed
Isaac, the Free-womans Son, and God was angry at him, and he was not an Heir of
the Blessing of God with Isaac whom he scoffed, but he was cast out, but Isaac
was an Heir of Gods Everlasting Blessing; and so you Scoffers and Mockers, who
mocks and scoffs those that fears God, Isa. 28.22.
you are of Ishmael's Seed, and you are not Heirs of the Blessing of God with
those whom you scoff and mock; but you are cast out, as Ishmael was, and has
not the Blessing, but the Curse; it is written, There shall come Mockers in the
Last Time, Jude 18.
who shall walk after their own ungodly Lusts. And you Vain-Talkers,
Foolish-Jesters, it is written in the holy Scriptures, 2 Timothy 3.1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8. Jam. 1.26, 27. Jam. 4.4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
That man's Religion is vain, who has not a Bridle to his Tongue; and so your
Religion is a vain Religion, who has not a Bridle to your Tongue; and all
peoples Religion upon the Earth is vain, who are not come to believe in, and
obey the Light of Christ in them; for none of them have a Bridle to their
Tongue, for they will say one thing, and do another, and many will Lie, and
Swear, and Scoff, and Mock and Dissemble, and speak one thing with their
Mouths, and have a contrary purpose in their Hearts, and whosoever does so
their Religion is a vain Religion, and God abhors it: Christ says, In your
Communication, Let your yea be yea, and your nay nay, Mat. 5.37.
and whatsoever is more then yea and nay comes of Evil; mark, that it comes
of Evil, Evil does not come from God, Ephesians. 4.29.
(but from the Devil,) and every idle word must an Account be given for unto
the Lord God: And all you Whoremongers, and Adulterers, Paul said unto the
Ephesians, That they knew that no Whoremonger, Heb. 13.4.
nor unclean person, nor any covetous man had any part in the Kingdom of God
and Christ: Let no man deceive you with vain words, for because of these things
comes the Wrath of God upon the Children of Disobedience; be not ye therefore
partakers with them, Ephesians. 5.5, 6, 7. And Whoremongers and Adulterers God will
judge: Luke 6.25. Eccl. 2.2. Eccles. 7.3, 4, 5, 6.
and it is written, Woe unto you that Laugh, for you shall Mourn, Sorrow is
better then Laughter, and the Laughter of a Fool is like the crackling of
Thorns under a Pot: Let your Laughter be turned into Heaviness, and your Joy
into Mourning, Humble your selver under the mighty hand of God, and he shall
lift you up: it is written in the Scriptures, That they that live in Sports and
Pleasures, 1 Timothy 5.6
are dead while they live, they are dead in Trespasses and Sins, and so are
dead from God: Sorrow is better then Langhter, the hearts of the Wise are in
the house of Mourning, but the hearts of Fools are in the house of Mirth. And
you Swearers, Christ says, Mat. 5.34. Jam. 5.12.
Swear not at all; and the Apostle says, Swear not by Heaven, nor by the
Earth, nor by any other Oath: And because of Oaths the Land Mourns.

So all ye wicked and ungodly people, those beforementioned words, with many
more, bears witness against you, and the Light of Christ within you, which is a
nearer and greater Witness, it condemns you, and so you are in a very Sad and
Miserable Condition, and you cannot see how to help your selves out of this
your Sad Estate, for you are neither ruled by the holy Scriptures without you,
nor by the Light of Christ within you, and so you are an unruly and
ill-governed people; for you are shut out from God, because you do not believe
in the Light wherewith he has enlightened you, and you are shut out of the
Scriptures also, which you do profess to be your Rule: for if you did believe
in the Light, in would lead you to do those things which God does require of
you, and so to do the good that is spoken of in the Scriptures, and to leave
the evil undone which is spoken against in the Scriptures; but you hating the
Light, and loving the Darkness, you do the evil that is spoken against in the
Scriptures, but you leave the good undone, and so you are not like Gods
Children, but the Children of the wicked One, whose work you are in; and so you
are stripped of all your Coverings, and you stand judged and condemned by the
Lord God, and you have no Cloak for your Sins.

But now I say unto you all, in the Fear of the Lord God, there is Mercy with
the Lord God, that you may yet come to Fear him, if you will come unto his
Light in all your Consciences, which lets you see how wickedly, and vainly you
have, and still do spend your time; I say, if you will believe in the Light
which condemns you for your Sins, and follow it, it will lead you out of your
Sins which it condemns you for; and though it is a condemning Light to you
while you disobey it, and do the evil that it lets you see you should not do;
yet when you obey it, it will keep you from doing any evil; and then you will
find it to be a Saving Light; and when it has Redeemed you out of the evil
which it condemns you for, then it will not condemn you, but it will justify
you, and speak comfortably unto you: But I say unto you all, do not delay, but
come unto the Light, and wait in it to receive power from God against the
Devil, and all his wicked works which he has wrought in you; and when the
Judgments of God does arise in your hearts for your Sins which you have
committed, then do not flee from that which judges you, and fills your
hearts with sorrow and trouble; for if you flee from that, then you will never
be cleansed from your Sins; for by the Spirit that judges Sin in the heart,
and burns against it as a Fire, was, and is the Sons and Daughters of Sion
converted unto God, yea, brought out of their Sins unto God; and whosoever
flees from that of God in them, which condemns them when they do evil; they
flee from that which God has placed in them to lead them out of evil, and so
they cannot come to be redeemed out of evil, until they come to love that which
condemns them for evil: so I say unto you in tender Love, love the Light within
you, and when it brings trouble upon you for your Sins which you have
committed, then own its judgments, for it will not judge you except you have
done wrong, and as you wait in it, it will let you see that its judgments are
very just and true; and so if you keep your minds unto it, it will work true
repentance in your hearts, and a godly sorrow, and it will lead you into the
House of Mourning, and through the Valley of Tears; and as David did, you will
come to water your Bed with your Tears, and to weep until your flesh fail of
fatness, and so you will travel through a short Sorrow, into an Everlasting
Joy; for the Sorrow lasts but for a Night, but Joy comes in the Morning; For
the Lord will give Beauty for Ashes, and the Oil of Joy instead of Mourning;
(but he gives this only unto those that comes into obedience unto his Light
within them;) so when condemnation comes upon you for Sins which you have
committed, do not flee from it; for it is the Rod of God, and you will see it
to be so, as you wait with your minds stayed in the Light, and you will see
that it is not for your hurt, but for your Everlasting good, and then consider
why should you flee from it; Oh, flee not from it, For whom I love I rebuke and
chasten, said God, and he restores every sinful man and woman, whom he
receives to be Sons and Daughters, and through his Judgments in their hearts,
he redeemeth them from Sin, and so receives them into his Everlasting Kingdom
of Life and Glory: So I say unto you, in dear and tender love, flee not from
that of God in you, which condemns you for Sin, and the Light it will be with
you when you are in the Fields, and when you lie in your Beds, and where ever
you go, the Light is in you; and if you love it, and keep your minds unto it,
it will teach you when you are at your Labor, and it will keep you out of all
Evil, if you keep your minds unto it; and when wicked people would tempt you to
that which is Evil, it will not let you consent unto them, but rather to
reprove them: and now people, I say unto you, if you love this same pure, and
holy, and spotless thing in you, which never consented unto any Sin that you
have committed, but has always stood in you a faithful Witness (against you)
when you did commit Sin; I say, if you love it, and obey it, though now it may
but be little in you, even as a Grain of Mustard Seed, which is a small Seed,
yet when your affections are truly set upon it, it will grow speedily, and will
become in you as a strong Tree, and the Fruit of it will ravish and overcome
your heart with heavenly Joy, and then you will see the folly and madness of
those who rejoices in doing of Evil; and you will find that Holy thing in you
to be as Christ said, Mat. 13.31, 32, 33.
Like a little Leaven that a woman took and hid in three Measures of Meal,
until the whole Lump was leavened, so as you wait in this Light within you,
though it lie low in you, because of the sinful nature which lies atop of it
in you, yet it will work in you as the Leaven does work in the Meal; for the
sinful nature which lies atop is of the Devil, and that which lies under is
of God, and as you join in true love and affection to that suffering Seed of
God, you shall come to know, and bear witness, that God is able to bring it out
of the Grave in you, and from under all those Powers of Darkness that has
oppressed it, for God is stronger then the Devil, that you will confess; and so
wait in the Light of Christ to feel more of the strength of God and Christ in
your own hearts (then of the strength of the Devil,) and when this you are come
to witness, (then you will have ceased from Sin, which is the Devils work) for
God who is the stronger in you, he will rule you by his Light and Spirit which
dwells in you; and then the Devil, who was the stronger in you, he will be cast
out, and then the Lamb, the Light, he will have the Victory in you, and will
lead you into all Truth; and so the Light, if you follow it, it will lead you
to be Children of the Lord God, who is Light, and in whom there is no Darkness
at all; and so the Children of the Lord are taught of the Lord, by the Light of
the Lord, and they are in Righteousness established: So put not the day afar
off, linger not away your time, but prize it, thou that is young in years, say
not in thine heart, I have time enough, I may take pleasure in Earthly things
yet for many days, and have time enough to repent and seek God afterward; I
say unto thee, say not so in thy heart, for the Lord God can cut thee down, as
in a moment, Psalm. 9.17.
though thou be in the Flower of thy Youth, but Remember thy Creator in the
days of thy Youth, and seek him while he may be found, for the Spirit of the
Lord will not always strive with man; and as the Tree falls so it lies,
there is no Repentance in the Grave, and there is no unclean thing can enter
into Gods Kingdom; for the wicked must be turned into Hell, and all that forget
God.

So remember you are warned by a Lover of Truth and Righteousness, and a true
Lover of the Souls and Bodies of all men, and desires not the Destruction of
any, but desires that all people might come to Repent while they have time,
and so obtain Mercy from the Lord God. I am known by the Name of

Postscript.
IT is said by many ignorant people, who use to plead for Sin, That the
Righteousest man that is upon the Earth, does Sin seven times a day; now, I
say, they do abuse and wrest the Scriptures, for there is no such word in all
the Bible, called the Old and New Testament: But in Proverbs 24. verse. 15, and
16. thus it is written, Lay not in wait, O wicked Man, against the Dwelling of
the Righteous, spoil not his Resting Place: For a Just Man falls seven times,
and rises again; but the Wicked fall into Mischief: Now [mark] the Just man
falls seven times, and rises again; now, I say, here is neither Sin, nor Day
spoken of; but the Wicked fall into Mischief: now consider, to do Mischief, is
to do Evil, and to do Evil, is Sin; but the Just man did not fall into
Mischief, and so he did not fall into Sin.

Now Hopkins and Sternhold, who was men that did play upon Instruments of
Music, in the same wisdom in which the Poets do make ungodly Ballads, they
made a Song which they called The Humble Complaint of a Sinner, and in that
Song of theirs there is some such like words, as the Just man sins seven
times a day; but those words of theirs are not to be heeded, for they had them
not out of the Holy Scriptures, but they are their own invented Lies.

Many other places of the Holy Scriptures are wrested after this manner by
those who have not believed in the Light, who pleads for Sin; for the Apostle
Paul according unto the wisdom given unto him, in all his Epistles he did write
things hard to be understood, which they that were unlearned and unstable did
wrest, as also they did the other Scriptures, to their own destruction; this is
Peter's Testimony, who was a Fisherman, and knew not Letters, 2 Pet. 3.15, 16.
Acts 4.13. So all people take notice, that it was not because they wanted
Greek, Hebrew, and Latin, that they wrested Paul's Epistles, and the other
Scriptures to their own destruction, but it was because they were not come to
believe in that measure of the Spirit wherewith Christ had enlightened them:
for from the Spirit of God was the holy Scriptures given forth, and there is
none can come to know them, and understand them, until they come to believe in,
and obey that measure of God in themselves, which is one with that from which
the holy Scriptures was given forth; and when people come to believe in that,
and learn of that, then God by that will open their understandings to know and
rightly to understand the holy Scriptures, and until then people can neither
know, nor understand them aright: for while people are out from that of God in
them, they one imagine one thing from the Scriptures, and another imagines
another thing from the same part of the Scripture; and one says it means
thus, and another he says, nay, but it means thus, and so they are
bewildered in their imaginations about the holy Scriptures: one saying, this is
the meaning, and another saying, that is the meaning, and so every one builds
his Religion according to his imagination; and so every one that has not
believed in the Light, they are wresting of the holy Scriptures, and with their
dark meanings are pleading Scripture, and would fain prove by the holy
Scriptures that theirs is the true Religion; and as Christ said it should be,
so it is come to pass, one says, Lo, here is Christ, and another says, Lo,
there is Christ: but Christ said unto the Saints, Go not forth: now the Saints
minds were gathered in unto the Light, and that gave them to know the holy
Scriptures, and also to know the false Prophets who led peoples minds out from
that of God in them; for the Way of God is to be known within, and he that
leads people from that of God in them, into outward observations, he is a
Deceiver and an Antichrist.

Pilate had Greek, Hebrew, and Latin, and he could not open the Scriptures by
it, nor know the Son of God by it, but he judged him to die, and when he was to
be Crucified, he did write a Superscription in Greek, Hebrew, and Latin
Letters, and set it over Christ's head: and the persecuting Jews had Greek,
Hebrew, and Latin, for they came and did read the Superscription which Pilate
had written, but they could not open the Scriptures with their Greek, Hebrew,
and Latin, though they had all the Prophets Writings who prophesied of his
coming, and of the Place where he was to be born, yet they could not understand
the Prophets words with all their Greek, Hebrew, and Latin, all their Earthly
wisdom and Learning was to short, and to shallow to understand those Heavenly
things: and so because they had not believed in the Light of Christ in them,
they were dark and blind Spiritually, and could not know, nor understand the
Scriptures, nor know Christ when he was come, but they said he had a Devil, and
was Mad: but had they come to that of God in them, that would have given them
the knowledge of the Scriptures, and the knowledge that he was the Son of God:
for he told them, that the Kingdom of God did not come with outward
observation, as Lo here, or Lo there, Luke 1^.20, 21.
but that the Kingdom of God was within them; and he told them, that it was
like a Grain of Mustard Seed, and it was like Leaven; and he did direct their
minds unto that in them, but they did not believe his Doctrine, and so would
not turn their minds inwardly to learn of the Father, the Word, and the Spirit;
and so they knew not the Son but Crucified him: and the Son said unto the
Father, I thank thee, O Father, Lord God of Heaven and Earth, that thou have
hid these things from the Wise and Prudent and thou have revealed them unto
Babes: now Pilate and the Jews, the wisest and most prudent men that was in all
that Quarter of the Earth, (in natural Learning, and natural Wisdom,) because
they did not come to that of God in them, therefore did God hide the Heavenly
things from them, and all their Greek, Hebrew, and Latin, and all their
natural Wisdom did not do them any good at all, as to bring them to the
knowledge of God; (but they were hurt by looking at it,) for because of their
great Learning and Wisdom naturally, their hearts were lifted up in Pride, and
they would not believe in Christ, nor receive his Testimony; they judged him an
inferior man unto them, and the Pride of their hearts deceived them; For the
World by Earthly wisdom does not know God, and the Carnal mind is Enmity
against God, and the Natural man receives not the things of God, for they are
Spiritually discerned, and they do appear Foolishness unto all Earthly minded
men and women. But Peter and John, and the rest of the Fishermen, who knew not
Letters, they were men of more humble and low Spirits then the Jews were, who
had Greek, Hebrew, and Latin; for they were proud because of their Tongues and
Natural Learning, as our English Priests and Doctors are; and ours can no more
know Christ, and the holy Scriptures by their Greek, Hebrew, and Latin, and
Earthly Wisdom, then Pilate and the Jews could: but Peter, and John, and the
rest of the Fishermen, they were low mean men, as to the outward, they did not
despise Christ because of his low Appearance outwardly, but they did believe in
him, and loved him, and did forsake their Nets, and followed him, and in them
God did take delight, and he did reveal Great and Mighty things unto them,
which was hid from Pilate and the Jews, who had Greek, Hebrew, and Latin.

And now, I say unto all people, God is rising to confound the Wisdom of all
the Earthly Wise men, who are proud of Greek, Hebrew, and Latin, and who
despise their Neighbors, who have it not, and all their Earthly Wisdom, in
which they have boasted and exalted themselves, will the Lord God make to
appear, as it is, Foolishness, and he will abase proud Haman in this the day of
his Mighty Power; yea, he will bring down the Mighty, and he will exalt them of
a low degree; yea, this is the Lord God doing, that no flesh may glory.

And now unto all people in tender Love I say, turn in your minds unto the
Manifestation of the Spirit and Light of Christ, which is given unto you to
profit withal, that it may give you the Knowledge of God, whom to know is
Eternal Life, and that it may open the holy Scriptures unto your
understandings: For it is written, No man knows the things of God, but by the
Spirit of God. And now, Oh all ye Professors, in all Forms, I charge you in the
Name and Power of the Lord God, do not give your dark meanings unto the holy
Scriptures, for they are of no private interpretation; and remember how you use
to take Paul's words in his Epistles, which are too hard for you to understand,
until you come unto the Light, and learn of it: I say, remember how you use to
take his words to plead for Sin for term of Life; but come to the Light of
Christ in you all, and Learn of it and it will stop your Mouths, and not
suffer you to open them to plead for Sin, which is the work of the Devil: I
charge you, in the Name of the Lord God, do not wrest the holy Scriptures to
plead for your Pride, and Covetousness, and Envy, and other Abominations which
you live in, and delight in; for Woe will come upon all that are covered and not
with the Spirit of the Lord God; and no other covering will stand you in stead
in the day when you must all receive a Reward according to the Deeds done in
the Body, whether they be good or evil. Read Isa. 28. from Verse 1, to 23.

And now I have cleared my Conscience in obedience unto the Lord God, and I
rest in peace; and whether you will hear, or forbear, I am clear.

W. G.
