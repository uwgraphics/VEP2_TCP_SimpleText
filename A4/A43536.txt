TO THE MOST EXCELLENT PRINCE, CHARLES, PRINCE OF WALES, Heire-Apparent to the
Monarchy of Great Britain, etc.
Most Illustrious Sir,
I Doubt not your Closet already abounds* and is daily replenished, with
volumes of English History, as those Mirrours, in whose Reflections your Royal
Ancestors, you may best discover Theirs, and direct your own Actions.

I therefore humbly address this piece to your Highness, not as a Book, but
as an Index, which cannot offer the Pomp of^ a Volume* yet may yield the
profit of a Manual.

The work is Posthumus, bereaved both of the Author and protection; and had it
not desired to live under the Patronage of so clement a Prince, was willing to
dye in the Cradle, rather then be exposed to theadventures of a distempered Age.

I refer its merits to the judgment of the Public (to whose use it affords
it self,) but humbly begges, that being an Orphan, its Fatherless condition
may find succor and countenance from the splendor of your goodness, under
which it has been first brought ^orth into the world.

Vouchsafe ^ therefore (Great Prince) to cast a gracious Eye on this
deserted^Object, and the poor Oblation of

Your most humbly devoted servant and Subject HENRY SEILE.

A GENERAL PREFACE, Touching the use of these three Catalogues or Tables.
HAving a purpose to peruse our English Histories, and those of foreign
Nations which had any intercourse or commerce with the affairs either of this
Realm or Church of England: I found it no small trouble to me, to know the
names of those, whose actions I encountered within the said perusal. For
whereas commonly great persons are not called by the names of their Families,
but of their Dignities: it was a matter of no mean difficulty to find out,
what and who they were, who were presented to us by their Dignities, as well
Ecclesiastical as Temporal. Upon this ground, to save me from that
troublesome inquiry for the time to come; I set my self to draw up a complete
and perfect Catalogue of all the persons of chief rank in this Realm of
England, from Earls inclusively and upwards; so far as any light of story,
and warrantable ascent, would direct and guide me. And having formed it in that
frame and order, as hereafter follows, found manifestly that that pains it
cost me, was not ill bestowed; because of that great ease it did me, being once
composed. For then no sooner did I meet in any story, with any, either Prince
or Prelate, of, or in this Nation; but I could forthwith turn unto him: and by
computing of the times, find out exactly who he was. And yet me thought it was
not perfect, till I had added to the same all those Sovereign Princes, which
have borne rule in all or any part hereof: the names and actions of the which
occur, as well in our own Chronicles, as foreign stories. That done, I
thought it not amiss, to note and add, according as I met it in my course of
reading, what Kings and Prelates of this Nation have been ennobled in the
Church with the style of Saints: as also what great offices any of the
Archbishops, Bishops, Dukes, Marquesses, and Earls, had severally borne in
the Civil State. By doing which, as I received great ease and benefit, as
before is said; so I was easily entreated to let all such partake thereof, who
think it may be either profitable or useful to them: and for that cause have
suffered it to come abroad, that they that will, may take the benefit of my
poor endeavors.

And this I have the rather been entreated to, to satisfy the minds of those
(if any thing will satisfy them) that either are the enemies of Regal or
Episcopal power. For whereas some conc^ive that Kings were instituted by the
people, on ^ight perhaps of such confusions as had been noted and observed in
a popular government: these following Catalogues will make it evident and
apparent, that in this Country there was never any other government then that
of Kings either in any part thereof, or the whole together.

And whereas it is factiously given out by others, that the Episcopal
authority and regiment in and of the Church, is not the proper and peculiar
government of the same, but violently obtruded on it by the power of man: the
Tables of Episcopal succession will make it evident, that the said form of
Government, is of as long a standing as the Church it self; Religion and
Episcopal jurisdiction being brought into this Land together.

Lastly, if any such there be, as have been formerly, that would cry down
Nobility, and that precedencie and power which some men have above the rest,
they may here see, that from the first settling of this Monarchy in the Norman
Race, that Kings of England have advanced to place and dignity, whom they
thought most fit; and did it sans control of inferior people. And so they
did no question in the Saxons times, and those before them: of which if we have
no such clear and evident succession, as in the rest of later ages; it is
because their digties, and honorarie titles were rather personal then
hereditary.

Now in these Catalogues, I shall begin, as reason is, with that of Kings, from
the first entrance of the Romans to this present time: to which I shall adjoyne
the Kings and Princes of Wales, as also the Kings and Lords of Man, and the
Isle of Wight^: assigning unto every one his time, according to the computation
of our best Historians. The Catalogue of the Bishops I shall bring along, from
the first planting of Religion here, amongst the Saxons; since which we have a
clear and undeniable succession in the holy Hierarchy: the former times, under
the Empire of the Britons, having transmitted to our hands only some fragments
of antiquity, by which we may perceive that the Episcopal government was here
received together with the faith it self; but cannot gather from the same a
constant and continued succession of the persons governing. Then for the third
Catalogue that of the Nobility, we have continued that from the first entrance
of the Normans to this present day; that at one view a man may see the quality
and antiquity of those noble families, which are now both an honor and an
ornament to this flourishing Kingdom. I shall not need say more in this
general Preface, having prefixed particular Prefaces to each several
Catalogue, to which I rather shall refer the Reader, then detain him here.

THE FIRST TABLE, OR, A CATALOGVE OF All the Kings which have reigned in
England, since the first entrance of the ROMANS. As Also of the Kings and
Princes of Wales, the Kings and Lord of Man, and the Isle of Wight, together
with the Princes and Lords of Powys.
.Printed at London. 1641.
THE PREFACE TO THE CATALOGVE Of the KINGS of ENGLAND.
THe Realm of England is that Southern and more flourishing part of the Isle
of Britain: that which was civi^ized by the Romans, and made a Province of
their Empire; when as the Northe^ne parts thereof, were ^ither neglected or not
conquered. When it was under the command of the Roman Emperors, it wanted not
its proper and peculiar Kings, over the chiefest and most principal of their
Tribes and Nations: it being the custom of that Empire, as* Tacitus has
truly noted, habere servitutis instrumenta etiam Reges. Of these inferior
tributary Kings, those which were in their several times of more power then
others, may probably be thought to have assumed unto themselves the style and
title of Kings of the Britons: even as in after times, during the heptarchy of
the Saxons, those which gave law unto the rest, did call themselves, and were
accounted the Kings or Monarchs of the English. But those inferior petite
Kings, being, in tract of time worn out, and almost all the South reduced
under the immediate command of the Roman Empire: either the Emperors
themselves, or such of their Lieutenants as did here usurp the regal state,
were styled Kings of Britain, till Constantine the Great united it inseparably
to the Roman Diadem: And in him ended the first line of the Kings of Britain,
according to the British story.

The second line of Kings, bears da^e from the departure of the Romans: who
being called from hence to look unto their Empire in the Continent, le^t their
possessions here unto the ^ury of the Scots and Picts, who dwelling in the
Northern and unconquered parts* attempted to subdue the Southern. For the
repressing of whose rage the Britons chose themselves a King out of Armo^ica,
(now called Bretag^e) being extracted from the old British blood, which had not
long before been planted in that Region, by the Roman Emperors. Whose li4e
continued here not long, till they were dispossessed both of Crown and
Country, by the Saxons, a German people, called in by Vortiger to oppose the
Scots and other Nations of the North. Who having by degrees subdued all that
which formerly had been conquered by the Romans (the Country beyond Severne
excepted only) divided it amongst themselves into seven Kingdoms; which
finally being all brought under by the West Saxon Kings, did at last settle,
and continues in the name of England. A Kingdom, though of small extent,
compared unto the greater Countries of France, Spain* and Germany, yet of so
high esteem abroad* that it may challenge an equality with either of them, and
in some kind has had preced^ncie before them.

For to the honor of this Realm, as well before as since it had the name of
England, we may say thus much. It was the first Kingdom which received the
faith of Christ, which was here planted, as it is affirmed by Gildas upon
certain knowledge, toward the latter end of Tiberius Empire. Tempore ut scimus
summo, Tiberii Cae^aris, as his own words are: which by computing of the
times, will fall to be five years before Saint Peter came to Rome; and but
five years after the death of our Redeemer. It showed unto the world the first
Christian King, whose name was Lucius: and gave unto the Church her first
Christian Emperor, even the famous Constantine here borne; by whose example
and encouragement the says was generally received over all the Empire, and all
the Temples of the Idols, either demolished or forsaken. It also was the first
Christian Kingdom, out of which the Jews, those bitter and most obstinate
enemies of the Cross of Christ, were universally expulsed; and our of which
the insolent and usurped Supremacy of the Popes of Rome, was first ejected,
after they had a long time domineered in the Church of Christ. The one of these
performed by King Edward the first; the other by King Henry the eighth. Not to
say any thing in this place of their wars and victories in France, Spain,
Scotland, the Netherlands, the Isle of Cyprus and the Holy land.

In these regards, the Kings of England, as they are a^ absolute, so they are
as sacred, as of any Country whatsoever What ever things are proper unto
Supreme Majesty, Scepters, and Crowns, ^he Purple Ro^e, the Glo^e, or golden
Ball and Unction, have been as long theirs, as any others. The four first are
by Leland, a ^^^ous Antiquarie, ascribed unto King A^thur, who did begin his
reign Anno 506. which was as soon^ as they were ordinarily in use with the
Roman Emperors. And thi^ does Leland justify, out of an ancient Seal of the
said King Arthurs kept in his time, as an especial monument in the Abbie of
Westminster: As for their Unction, or Anointing, it appears by the old Roman
Pr^vinciall, and the ancient practice, that of all the Kings of Christendom,
there were none anciently anointed but the two Emperors of the East and West;
the Kings of France, England, Sicilie, and Hier^salem. By reason of which
Unction or anointing (besides what is united or annexed to the Crown
Imp^riall of this Realm) it was declared Term. Hilarii. 33. Edward 3. that the
Kings of England were capaces jurisdictionis spiritualis, capable of Spiritual
or Ecclesiastical jurisdiction. As after in the reign of King Henry the
eighth, it was declared rather then enacted, that the Kings highness was the
Supreme head of the Church of England, and that he had authority to reform all
errors, heresies, and abuses in the same. 26. Henry 8. cap. 1. Which title or
Supreme head, though used by King Edward 6. in a^l his ^eigne, and by Queen
Mary for awhile; was changed by Queen Elizabeth into that of Supreme
Governor: and it is now reckoned as a part of the style of the Kings of
England, that they are Supreme Governo^rs in all their Dominions and Countries,
over all persons, in all causes, as well Ecclesiastical as Temporal.

Now as the Kings of England are absolute at home; so are they no less
honored and esteemed abroad: the Emperor being accounted filius major
Ecclesiae, the eldest son of the Church; the King of France, filius minor, or
the second son; and the King of England, filius tertius and adop^ivus, the
third and the adopted son. In general Councels, the King of France took
place at the Emperors right hand; the King of England on his left, and the
King of Scots having precedencie next before Castile. And whereas since the
time of Charles the fifth, the Kings of Spain have challenged the precedencie
of all Christian Princes: yet in the time of King Henry 7. Pope Julius gave it
to the English before the Spaniard. Nay lest the Kings of England might fall
short in any thing wherein their neighbor Princes glory, they also have an
adjunct or peculiar title annexed unto the style Imperial. For where the King
of France is styled Christianissimus, most Christian; and the King of Spain,
Catholi^us, or the Catholic King: the King of England has the title of
Defensor fidei, o^ the defender of the Faith. A title not so much conferred on
King Henry 8. by the Popes of Rome, as confirmed unto him. For in a Charter of
King Richard 2. unto the University of Oxford, the same style occurres: for
which and other proofs hereof consult the Epistle Dedicatory before Doctor
Craca^^horp against the Archbishop of Spalato; and Sir Isa^c Wake, in his Rex
Platonicus. But now we go unto the Kings.

The Kingdom and Kings of Kent.
THe Saxons being called in by Vortiger to resist the Scots, and other people
of the North, did by degrees expulse the Britons: and having totally subdued
the Country, erected in the same seven Kingdoms. Of these the ancientest was
that of Kent, confined within that County only: the Kings these that follow.

The Kingdom and Kings of the SOUTH SAXONS.
THe Kingdom of the South Saxons was begun by Ella, a noble Captain of that
people. It contained the two Counties of Sussex and Survey, which were thence
denominated: the first so called quasi South sex, the Country of the
South Saxons: the second q^asi South rey, as lying on the South of the river
T^amise. This Kingdom lasted but a while, and had only these four Kings that
follow. viz. A. Chapter 488 1 Ella the first King of the So^th-Saxo^s. 514 2 Cissa.
3 Ethelwolf or Edilwach the first Christened King of the South Saxons. 4 Berthun
and Authun two brothers both jointly reigning, and both jointly vanquished by

The Kingdom and Kings of the WEST SAXONS.
THe third in order of these Kingdoms, and that which did in fine prevail
over all the rest, was that of the West Saxons. It contained in it the Counties
of Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Sommerset, Wiltes, Southampton, and Berks: the
Kings these. A. Chapter 522 1 Cerdicus the first King. 17. 539 2 Kinricus. 29. 565

The Kingdom and Kings of the EAST SAXONS.
THe Kingdom of East Saxons is the fourth in order, of the Heptarchie; begun
in Anno 527. some five years after that of the W^st-Saxons. It comprehended
the Counties of Essex, Midlesex, and part of Hertfordshire; the Kings these
that follow. A. Chapter 527 1 Erchenwme. 587 2 Sledda. 596 3 S. Seber, tthe first

The Kingdom and Kings of the EAST ANGLES.
NExt to the Kingdom of the East Saxons, was that of the East Angles;
containing in it the Counties of Norfolk, Suffolk, and Cambridge shire, with
the Isle of Ely: and had these Kings following. A. Chapter 575 1 Uffa, the first
King. 582 2 Titullus. 593 3 Redwald the first christened King. 624 4 Erpenwald.
636 5 S. Sigebert. 638 6 Egric. 642 7 Anna. 654 8 Ethelbe^t. 656 9 Edelwald.

Ethelbert. II. who died Anno 793. 870 15 S. Edmund. After whose slaughter by
the Danes, and that his Kingdom had been long wasted by that people; it was
at last united to the West Saxons, by King Edw the elder.

The Kingdom and Kings of the NORTH-HUMBERS.
THe Kingdom of the North humbers, or Northumberland, was the fifth in course
of time, of the Saxon Hepta^chy; it was divided into two parts or Provinces,
the one of which was called Bernicia; the other D^ira: of which the former
called Bernicia, was founded by one Ida, Anno 547. the other by one Ella, his
fellow and companion in arms, Anno 559. This last contained the whole
Countries from the North of Humber to the Twede, viz. the Counties of York,
Durham, Lancaster, Westmorland, Cumberland, and Northumberland: the other all
that part of Scotland, which lies between the river Twede, and the Frith of
Edenbourg; which was as far as ever the Romans had gone before them. Those
Kings of either, which were more powerful then the other, were honored with
the name of Kings of the North humbers, and are marshalled thus. A. Chapter 547 1
Ella and Ida. 2 Adda and Elappea. 3 Theodwald, 4 Frethulfe. 5 Theodorick. 589 6
Ethelrick. 593 7 Ethel^ride. 617 8 Edwine the first christened King. 633 9

23 Al^wald. 789 24 Osred. II. 794 25 Etheldred. II. After whose death this
Kingdom much molested by the Danes, became a Province of the West-Sax^^s.

The Kingdom and Kings of MERCIA.
THe last and greatest of the seven Kingdoms of the Saxons, was that of
Mercia, so called, for that being seared in the middle of the whole Country,
it was a March or border unto all the rest which abutted on it. It comprehended
the Counties of Gl^^cester, Hereford, Worcester, Warwick, Leicester, Rutland,
Northampton, Lincoln, Bedford, Nottingham, B^ckingham, Oxford, Darby, Stafford,
Shropshire, Cheshire, and that other part of Hertfordshire, which was not under
the Kingdom of the East Saxons. By reason of this great extent of Empire, ^hey
were a long time very powerful, and overawed their neighbor Princes: till at
the last the fatal period being come, it fell into the Arms of the
West Saxons, after it enjoyed these twenty Kings which hereafter follow. A. Chapter
582 1 Cridda the first King of Mercia 593 2 Wibba. 614 3 Cheorl. 626 4 Penda.
656 5 Peada, the first christened King. 659 6 Wulfher^. 675 7 Ethelred. 704 8

Withlafe. 839 19 Berthulf. 85^ 20 Burdred. After whose death this Kingdom
having been shrewdly shaken in a great battle fought near Burford, Commit.
Oxo^. wherein King Ethelbal^ was vanquished, and his whole strength broken by
Cuthbert, or Cuthred, King of the West Saxons, then his tributary: and after no
less shrewdly shaken by the valiant Egbert, became a Province of that Empire.

The Monarchs of the English-SAXONS.
THe Saxons, though they were divided into the seven Kingdoms before named,
were for the most part subject unto one alone; who was entitled R^x Gentis
Anglorum, or King of the English Nation: those which were stronger then the
rest, giving the law unto them in their several turns, till in the end they
all became incorporated into the Empire of the West Saxons. Which Monarchs, who
they were, and of whence entitled, is next in order shown. A. Chapter 455 1
Hengist King of Kent. 481 2 Ella King of the South Saxons. 495 3 Cerdick King
of the West Saxons. 534 4 Kenrick King of the West Saxons. 561 5 Cheuline, or

Egbert the son^e of Al^mond, King of the West Saxons, the first and absolute
Monarch of the whole Heptarchy: who having vanquished all, or most of the Sax^n
Kings, and added their estates unto his own, commanded the whole Country to
be called by the name of ENGLAND. The Kings wh^reof, after the Count^^y was so
named, are these that follow.

preserve.

Kings of WALES.
THe Britons being outed of their Country by the conquering Saxons, retired
themselves beyond the Severn, and therein fortified themselves; which Country
thereupon came to be called Wales, and the people Walsh, or Welsh men. Not
that the word Walsh, signified in the Saxon language, a Foreiner or Alien, as
it is ^conceived (for how could they be called Aliens in their native
Country?) but Wales, and Wallish, for Galls and Gallish, by changing G into
W, according to the custom of the Saxons. The Britons being descended of the
Gauls, kept their old name still; though somewhat altered in the letter, as
before is said: and to this day the French do call the Prince of Wales, by the
name of le Prince de Galls. At first their cheifes were honored with the
title of Kings of Wales, and are these that follow. A. Chapter 690 1 Idwallo. 30.

The Principality and Princes of South Wales.
SOuth- Wa^es, in the division of the Country amongst the sons of Roderick
Mawr, ^ell unto Cadel the second son. It contained all that quantity and
tract of ground, which now we call the Counties of Glamorgan, Pembroke,
Carmarthen, Cardigan, and part of Brecknock: which being the richer and more
fruitful part of Wales, and lying most open to invasion, both by sea and land,
was soonest brought under the command of the Kings of England. The principal
seat of the Princes of it, was Dyn^sar, or Dynevor Castle, not far from
Carmarthen, who thence were called by their subjects, the Kings of Dynevor; and
whilst they stood upon their own legs, were these that follow. A. Chapter 877 1

Country being conquered by the English, and his two sons Meredith and

After which time South Wales was reckoned as a part of the Realm of England.

The Principality and Princes of North Wales.
North Wales in the division of the Kingdom of Wales, fell to the share of
Amarawd, the eldest son of Roderick Mawr, the last King thereof; with a
superior^ty of power over both the rest, who were but homagers to this. It
contained in it all that territory which now does comprehend the Counties of
Merioneth, De^bigh, Flint, Carna^von, and the Is^e of Anglesey, which being the
more mountainous parts; and consequently of more difficult access then the
others were, as they did longest keep their liberties, so do they still
preserve their language from the incursions of the English* Abers^aw in the
Isle of Anglesey was the Princes seat, who were hence sometimes called the
Kings of Abersraw, and were these ensuing. A. Chapter 8077 1 Amarawd eldest son

The Kings and Princes of it, according to the History of Wales.
IN the History of Wales, writ by Humphrey Lloyd, the Kings and Princes of
Wales are reckoned differently from that succession of them before laid down.
The reason of which difference may be that he recites there the Predominant
Princes, such as gave law unto the rest, whether of North Wales, South Wales,
or of Powys-land: even as we see was done before, in summing up the Monarchs
of the English Saxons, out of the several Kingdoms in that Heptarchie. Now for
his Catalogue of the Welsh, both Kings and Princes, he recites them thus. A Chapter

Prince of Wales of the British race, who lost his life and principality to King
Edward the first, Anno 1282. After whose death, the King perceiving that the
Welsh had no affection to be ruled by strangers; sent for his Queen then great
with child, to come unto him to Carnarvon, and hearing that she was delivered
of a son, called the Welsh Lords together, and proffered them a Prince to
bear rule amongst them, of their own nation, one who spoke no word of
English, and such a one whose life no man could tax. To such a Prince when they
had all sworn to yield obedience, he named his newborn son unto them, and
made him their Prince, since when the eldest sons of England have commonly
been created Princes of Wales.

The Princes of it, of the blood Royal of England.
WALES thus brought under the obedience of the Kings of England, has since
been commonly the honourary title and possession of their eldest sons. Not
that they challenge it, as of due belonging to them; but take it from their
Fathers as of special Grace, by solemn creation and investure, tenendum sibi
and Haeredibus suis Regibus Augliae, to hold to them and their heirs Kings of
England: our Kings not being willing to deprive themselves of such a power of
gratifying and obliging their eldest sons, as they saw occasion. Edward 2.
who had been summoned by his Father unto the Parliament by the name of Prince
of Wales, and Earl of Chester: summoned his eldest son (King Edward 3.) by
no other name then Earl of Chester and Flint. Edward 3. first used the
ceremony of creation, by letters Patents, and investiture, which has since
continued: and for the want of which, Edward 6. Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth
however in their several turns, they have been called Princes and Princesses
of Wales, were not truly such. Those which were so created, either by
Parliamentary Writ or especial Charter, are these that follow. A. Chapter 1 Edward

Princes and Lords of Powys-land.
POwys-land is the third part of Wales, but the least of all, containing only
the whole County of Montgomery, and part of Radnor, Brecknock, Denbigh, and
Shropshire. The chief seat hereof was Matravall, in Montgomery shire, from
whence the Princes of it would be called the Kings of Matravall. It was
bestowed by Roderick Mawr, in his division of Wales, on Mervyn his youngest
son* and did continue in his line a long time together: but much afflicted and
dismembered by the Princes of Northwales, who cast a greedy eye upon it. The
first Prince of it was called Mervyn, but we have no good constat of his
successors: the last that held it all entire, was Meredith ap Blethin, who
divided it between his two sons, Madoc, and Gryffith, of the which Madoc
died at Winchester, Anno 1160. and Gryffith was by Henry the first of England
created Lord Powys, the residue of Powys-land which pertained to Madoc,

Kings and Lords of MAN.
THe Isle of MAN is situate so equally between England and Ireland, that once
it was a controversy unto the which it appertained; but was in fine adjudged
to England, in that some venomous worms brought hither, did not furthwith die:
which kind of creatures the nature of the Irish soil will by no means
brook. It was once subject unto the crown and Kingdom of Northumberland, but
from them taken by the Danes, Norwegians, and other people of the North, in
their irruptions on these parts: who having mastered it, ordained therein a
Pe^it King of their own Nation; who thus succeeded one another. A. Chapter Kings

brought this and all the rest of the Western Isles under his obedience. After
this time, it was sometimes dependant on the Crown of Scotland, and sometimes
on England, according as their fortunes varied: till in the end, it was
regained finally from the Scots, by William Montacute Earl of Salisbury (who
was descended from the ancient Kings of Man) and by him after sold to the Lord
Scrope, on whose attainder it fell unto the Crown of England, and changed
Lords as follows. Kings and Lords of MAN, of English blood.

Lords and Kings.
THe Isle of Wight abutting on the coast of Hampshire, was taken from the
English by William Fitz-Osborne, Earl of Hereford, in the time of William Duke
of Normandy, and King of England: who thereupon became the first Lord thereof.
After whose death and the proscription of his son Roger, it fell unto the
Crown, and was by Henry the second bestowed upon the family of the Ryvers,
Earls of Devon. On the extinction of which line, it fell again unto the
Crown, in the time of King Edward the first; and in the same has since
continued: giving the title only of one King, and one Lord to two Potent
subjects. Now for the Lords and King, they are these here following. A. Chapter 1

THE SECOND TABLE, OR, A CATALOGVE OF All the Bishops which have governed in
the Church of England, and Wales, since the conversion of the SAXONS. Together

civil government.

Printed at London. 1641.
THE PREFACE TO THE ENSUING CATALOGUE of Archbishops, and Bishops.
THE ^aith of Christ being here planted as ^aith Gilda^, tempore summo Tiberii
Caesaris, toward the latter end of Tiberius Caesar, was as it seems,
concealed and hidden ^ill the time of Lucius: who publicly making profession
of it, procured three Archiepiscopall seats to be erected at York, Caer-Leon
upon Vsk, and London for the North, West, and Southern parts; and suffragan
Bishops to be allotted and assigned unto each of them. Of these and their
successors we have little Constat, only some footsteps in some places,
whereby we may discern the ruin of religion which had been made here by the
Saxons. But when the Saxons were converted to the Christian faith, they grew
more zealous of the same, then formerly they had been a verse from it: and
gave it suddenly a general and unanimous admittance. Which being done, that
part of England which was then in their possession, was divided into the two
Provinces of Cante^bury and York: the ancient Britons or the Welsh continuing
for a long time after under the rule and government of their own Archbishop;
but in the and were also brought to yield obedience to the Sea of Canterbury.
The Church thus brought into a settled form and order, became forthwith of
such esteem at home, that they have long time been accounted Peers of the
Realm, and are by writ summoned unto all Parliaments, as are the temporal
Barons; and of such reputation and fame abroad, that the Archbishops of both
Provinces were adjudged to be Legatinati: the Archbishop of Canterbury having
a superintendencie over all the Irish Bishops; as he of York, had a direct
primacie over those of the Church of Scotland. And in the Council held at
Constance, what time the Fathers there assembled, were for the better dispatch
of business, divided into several Nations: the English Nation, Anglicana
natio, was reckoned amongst the chiefest. At this time since this Church was
manumitted from the Pope, it may be warrantably said to be the most exact and
perfect of the Reformation: keeping a constant and continued succession in the
holy Hierarchy, and consequently also in all holy Orders; and whatsoever else
is necessary, either in doctrine, government, or ceremony, unto the
constitution of an Apostolical and Orthodax Church.

As for the method which we mean to use in this following Catalogue, it is
briefly this: we will begin first with the Province and See of Canterbury, and
those particular Sufragan Bishops which owe obedience thereunto, which we will
marshall in the order of the Alphabet, those of Wales included. For howsoever
they had once the honor to have an Archbishop of their own, yet being now
reputed members of the Province of Canterbury; we will dispose of them
accordingly. That done, we will proceed unto the Province and See of York, and
those few Bishoprics, which are now remaining of the same: which as the rest
before, we will also take along, according to the order of the Alphabet. And
this we take to be the easiest order for the Reader: that of the Antiquity of
the Sees, being very intricate and perplexed, and that of the Antiquity or
consecration of the men themselves, both changeable and uncertain. For if we
went according to the way of precedencie which is now in use, established by
Act of Parliament 31. H. 8. c. 10. we should dispose them in this manner: viz.
First the two Archbishops of Canterbury and York, next the three Bishops of
London, Dunelm, Winchester, and last of all the residue of the Prelates
according to the Seniority of their consecrations. This is the order of
precedencie which is now in use, which yet is no new order in regard of London
and Winton, who anciently had place before the rest, in all assemblies of the
Clergy: but this being changeable and uncertain, as before was said, we shall
make use rather of the other.

Now in each See and Diocese we will keep this course: First we will show you
the antiquity and ordination of each, together with the foundation of their
Cathedral Churches; what Counties each of them contains, what privileges
anciently they enjoyed, and still claim to have; how many Parishes there be in
every Diocese, by what Archdeacons they are governed, what is the tenth of the
whole Clergy in every Diocese, and how much in the Kings books is every
Bishopric. We shall observe also, what and how many of the Prelates have been
extract from honorable houses, whose names shall be distinguished by a little
Afterisme thus *, as also how many of them have been canonized and accounted
Saints, who and how many of them have been made Cardinals in the Church of
Rome, what honorable Offices have been borne by any of them in the civil
state. In the performance of the which S. shall stand for Saint, and Card for
Cardinal: L. Chapter shall signify L. Chancellor; L. K. Lord Keeper; L. Tr. Lord
Treasurer; L. Pr. Lord President, Chapter J. Chief Justice. M. To. Master of the
Rolls, and Chapter Ox. Chancellor of Oxford, as Chapter Ca. of Cambridge. By which it
will appear most plainly what a perpetual Seminary this our Church has
been, of able and of learned men, not only for discharge of Ecclesiastical,
but even temporal business. Which being premised once for all, we now
proceed unto our Catalogue: beginning with the Province and See of Canterbury,
and following in the order before proposed.

THE FIRST PART OF THE CATALOGVE OF BISHOPS, CONTAINING THE SVCCESSION of the
Archbishops and Bishops of the Province of CANTERBVRY,
Printed at London. 1641*
CANTERBURY and the Archbishops of it.
The Sea of Canter. was first founded with the plantation of religion the
amongst English: Austin the Monk, who first did preach the Gospel to the one*
being the first Archbishop of the other. The Chair hereof originally fixed in
the City of Canterbury; which being once the Regal City of the Kings of Kent,
wa^ by King Ethelbert, on his conversion, bestowed on Austin the Archbishop,
and on his Successors for ever. The Cathedral, having been a Church before in
the Brit^ns time, was by the same Archbishop Austin repaired, and consecrated,
and dedicated to the name of Christ, which it still retains; though a long
time together it was called Saint Thomas, in honor of Saint Thomas Becke^ who
was therein slain. The present fabric was begun by Archbishop Lanfranc, and
William Corboyl; and by degrees made perfect by their Successo^^^^. Take
Canterbury as the seat of the Metropolitan* and it has under it 21. suffragan
Bishops, of the which 17. are in England, and 4. in Wales. But take it as the
seat of a Diocesan, and it contains only some part of Kent to the number of
257. Parishes (the residue being in the Diocese of Rochester;) together with
some few particular Parishes dispersed here and there in several Dioceses: it
being an ancient privilege of this See, that wheresoever the Archbishops had
either Manors or Advowsons, the place forthwith became exempted from the
Ordinary, and was reputed of the Diocese of Canterbury.

The other privileges of this See, are that the Archbishop is accounted
Prima^e and Metropolitan of all England, and is the first Peer of the Realm:
having precedencie of all Dukes, not being of the Royal blood, and all the
great Officers of the State. He has the title of Grace offered him in common
speech* and writes himself divina providentia, where other Bishops only use,
divina permissione. The Coronation of the King has anciently belonged unto
him: it being also formerly resolved that wheresoever the Court was, the King
and Queen were speciales and domestici Parochian^ Domini Archiepiscopi, the
proper and domestical Pariihioners of the Arch Bishop of Canterbury. It also
did belong unto him in former times, to take unto himself the offerings made
at the holy Altar by the King and Queen, wheresoever the Court was, if he were
present at the same; and to appoint the Lent Preachers: but these time has
altered, and the King otherwise disposed of. Abroad in general Councels he had
place at the Popes right foot: at home, this Royal privilege, that those
which held lands of him, were liable for Wardsh^p to him, and to compound with
him for the same, though they hold other lands in Chief of our Lord the King.
And for the more increase of his power and honor, it was enacted 25 H. 8. c.
21. that all licenses and dispensations (not repugnant to the law of God) which
heretofore were sued for in the Court of Rome, should be hereafter granted by
the Archbishop of Canterbury and his successors: As also in the 1. Eliz. c.
2. that by the advice of the Metropolitan, or Ecclesiastical Commissioners,
the Queens Majesty may ordain and publish such ri^es and ceremonies, as may
be most for the advancement of Gods glory, the edifying of his Church, and the
due reveren^e of Christ's holy Sacraments. To come at last to the Archbishops,
this Diocese has only one Archdeacon, which is he of Canterbury* the Clergies
tenth comes to 651. li. 18. s. 2. d. q. and the Archbishopric it self is
valued in the Kings books, at the sum of 2816. li. 17. s. 9. d. q. I only add
in general, that this See has yielded to the Church 16. Saints; to the Church
of Rome 9. Cardinals; to the Civil state of England 11. Lord Chancellours, one
Lord Treasurer, one Lord Chief Justice; and to the University of Oxford 9.

SAINT ASAPH AND the Bishops there.
THe Bishopric of Saint Asaph is exceeding ancient; first founded by one
Kentigern a Scot, and there Bishop of Glasco, about the year 560. The
Cathedral there first built by him, upon the Banks of the river Elwy: whence
it is called by the Welsh, Llan-Elwy; the Bishop in the ancient Latin
Elwensis, or Elguensis; by us Saint Asaph, from Saint Asaph an holy man, whom
Kentigern returning into Scotland, left here his successor. It seems (...)
stood not long, or not long in credit; there being a great hiatus in the
succession of the Bishops: none to be found between this S. Asaph, and Geofrie
of Monmouth, who was here Bishop in the latter end of King Stephens reign. And
which is more, Henry of Huntington in his recital of the Welsh Bishoprics
reckons only three, Saint David's, Bangor, and Landaffe: which may be
probably imputed to the frequent watres in this bordering Country (for it is
^eated in the County of Flint, not far from Chester:) which made it an
unquie^ seat for religious persons. This Bishopric, being at the best, not
very rich, was made much poorer in the time of Bishop Parfew, who lived in the
days of King Edward 6. For where the Bishop had before five Episcopal houses,
there is none now left but Saint Asaphs only, the ^^st together with the lands
to them belonging, by him made away, and aliened from the Church for ev^r:
besides, that keeping an house above his means, he was feign to let the
residue of his lands into tedious leases, not yet expired. This ^^ocese
contains in it no one whole County, but part of Denbigh, Flint, Montgomery,
Merioneth, and some towns in Shropsh: wherein are to the number of 121
Parishes, most of the which are in the immediate Patronage of the Bishop. It
has but one Arch-Deaconry* called of Saint Asaph, which is united to the
Bishopric, for the better susten^ation of it. The tenth of the Clergy comes
to 186. li. 19. s. 7. d. ob q. and for the Bishopric it self, it is valued in
the Kings books, at the sum of 187. li. 11. s. 6. d. Bishops of Saint Asaph.

BANGOR, and the Bishops there.
BAngor, another of the Bishoprics of Wales, is of ancient standing; but by
whom founded, not yet known. The Cathedral there is dedicated by the name of
S. Daniel, who was Bishop here about the year 516. which being cruelly defaced
by that wretched Rebel Owen Glendowr, was afterward repaired by Henry Deane,
who was once here Bishop. The ruin of this Bishopric, came in the time of
Bishop Bulkeley, who not content to alienate and let out the lands; made a sale
also of the Bells: and going to the Sea-shoare to see them shipped, in his
return was smitten with a sudden blindness. This Diocese contains in it the
entire County of Carnarvon, wherein Bangor stands, and the whole Isle of
Anglesey; together with parts of Denbigh, Merioneth, and Mountgomery, and in
them to the number of 107 Parishes, whereof 36. impropriated. It has moreover
in it, three Arch Deaconries, viz. of Bangor, A^glesey, and Merioneth, one of
the which is added to the Bishopric, for support thereof. The Bishopric is
valued in the Kings books, 131. li. 16. s. 4. d. and answers for the
Clergies tenth, 151. li. 14. s. 3. d. q. Bishops of Bangor.

BATH AND WELLS, and the Bishops of it.
THe Diocese of Bath and Wells, although it has a double name, is one single
Bishopric. The Bishops seat originally at Wells, where it still continues,
and in respect whereof this Church is called in some Writers, Fontanensis
Ecclesia. The style of Bath came in but upon the by. The Church of Wells first
built by Ina, King of the West Saxons, Anno 704. and by him dedicated to Saint
Andrew: after endowed by Kenu^^e, an other King of the same people, Anno 766.
and finally made a bishops See in the time of Edward the elder, Anno 905. the
first that bore that title being Adelmus, before Abbat of ^lastenbury. The
present Church, in place where that of Ina had stood before, was built most
part of it by Bishop Robert, the eighteenth Bishop of this See; but finished
and perfected by Bishop Ioceline, surnamed de Wells. Johannes de villula, the
sixteenth Bishop having bought the town of Bath of King Henry the first for
500. marks, transferred his ^eate unto that City, 1088. Hence grew a jarre
between the Monks of Bath and Canons of Wells, about the election of the
Bishop. At last the difference was thus composed by that Bishop Robert, whom
before I spoke of, that from thence forward the Bishop should be denominated
from both places, and that precedencie in the style should be given to Bath;
that in the vacancie of the Sea, a certain number of Delegates from both
Churches should elect their Prelate, who being elected, should be installed in
them both; both of them to be reckoned as the Bishops Chapter, and all his
Grants and Patents confirmed in both. And so it stood until the reign of King
H. 8. what time the Monastery of Bath having been dissolved, there passed an
Act of Parliament for the Deane and ^hapter of Wells, to make one sole Chapter
for the Bishop: Anno 35. H. 8. c. 15.

But to proceed, this Diocese has yielded to the Church of Rome, one Card. and
to the civil state of England, six Lord Chancellours, five Lord Treasurers,
one Lord Privy S^ale, one Lord President of Wales, one principal secretary of
Estate. The Diocese contains in it the whole County of Somerset, and in that
388. Parishes, whereof 160. are impropriate. It has moreover three
Arch-Deaconries of Bath, Wells, and Taunton; is valued in the Kings books, at
533. li. 1. s. 3. d. and answers for the Clergies tenth, 353. li. 18. s. ob.

BRISTOL, and the Bishops thereof.
THe Bishopric of Bristol is of new erection, first ^ounded by King Henry 8.
who having had the spoil of the Monasteries, and religious houses, was pleased
to refund some of it back again upon the Church, for the encouragement of
learning, and increase of piety. For this end he procured an Act of Parliament,
for the erecting of new Bishoprics by his letters Patents, 31. H. 8. c. 9. and
did accordingly erect six new Bishops Sees, viz. at Bristol, Oxford,
Westminster, Gloucester, Peterburgh, and Chester. According to the tenor of
which Act, he did immediately erect six new Bishoprics on the foundations of
such ancient Mo^asteri^s, as (...) ^hought fittest for that purpose, and most
convenient of honor, in regard of their situation: Wherein he failed not any
where so much as in this of Bristol, the Diocese thereof being very much
distant from the Sea; a^que alio sub sole (...)

Now for this Bishopric, the seat thereof is Bristol, as before I said, one
of the fairest Cities in the Realm of England* and a just County in it self.
The Cathedral Church is dedicated by the name of Saint Austins, founded by
Robert Fitz-Harding son to a King of Danemarke, once a Citizen here; and by
him stored with Canons Regular. Anno 1148. But this foundation being dissolved,
King H. 8. made it a Bishops See, and placed therein a Deane, and six
Prebendaries, as it still continues. For 32. years together in Qu* Eliz. time
it had never a Bishop, but all that while was held in Commendam by the Bishops
of Gloucester: the Patrimony of the Church being in the interim much wasted.
The Diocese hereof contains, besides the City of Bristol, the whole County of
Dorset (belonging heretofore to the Sea of Salisbury:) and therein 236.
Parishes, of which 64. impropriated. It has only one Archdeacon, which is he
of Dorset; is valued in the Kings books, 383. li. 8. s. 4. d. and answers
for the tenth of the' Clergy, 353. li. 18. s. ob. q. Bishops of Bristol.

CHICHESTER, and the Bishops thereof.
The Sea of Chichester, was anciently in the Isle of Selsey, not far from
thence: first planted there by Wilfrid Archbishop of York, who being banished
his Country by Egfride King of the Nort^umbers, did preach the Gospel to the
South Saxons. To him did Edilwach, the South-Saxon King assign this Island for
his seat; and after Cedwall King of the West Saxons, having won this
Kingdom, built in the same a Monastery, which he made the Bishops See. Here it
continued till the time of Bishop S^ig^^d, who first* removed the Sea to
Chichester, the principal City of these parts; first built by Cissa the second
King of the South Saxons, and by him called Cissan-Ceaster. The Cathedral
Church was anciently dedicated to Saint Peter; new built by Radulph the third
Bishop here, after the Sea removed by Stigand: which being almost all consumed
by a raging fire, was afterward rebuilt and beautified by Siffridus the second.

But to proceed, this See has yielded to the Church two Saints, to the Realm
three Lord Chancellours, to the Court two Almoners, one Chancellor to the
University of Oxford: and anciently the Bishops here were Confessors to the
Queens of England, (for which they have to show an ancient Charter) and had
allowance for the same. This Diocese contains the County of Sussex, and in
the same 250. Parishes; whereof 112, impropriated. It has moreover two
Archdeacons, viz. of Chichester, and Lewys; is valued in the Kings books, at
677. li. 1. s. 3. d and answers for a tenth of the whole Clergy. 287. li. 2.

COVENTRY AND LICHFEILD, and the Bishops thereof.
THhe Bishopric of Coventry* and Lichfeild is like that of Bath and Wells; a
double name, a single Diocese. The Bishops See originally at Lichfeild, from
thence removed to Chester, and from both ^o Covent^y. Hence is it that the
Bishops are called sometimes Cestre^ses, sometimes Lichfeildenses, sometimes
Coventrienses, and now of late, Bishops of Coventry and Lichfeild. For in the
year 1088. being that very year wherein the Sea of Wells was removed to
Bath; Robert de Limesey did remove this See ^o Coventry* Hugo Novant, the sixth
from him brought it back to Lichfeild, not without great opposition of the
Monks of Coventry: and in the end, the difference finally was composed by
Bishop Savensby, much after the same manner, as before at Wells. For here it
was agreed on that the Bishop should be denominated from both places, and that
precedencie in the style Episcopal, should be given to Coventry: that they
should choose their Bishop ^lternatim, in their several turns; that they
should both make one Chapter unto the Bishop, in which the Prior of Coventry
should be the principal man. And so it stood till that the Priory of Coventry
being dissolved by King Henry 8. (the style or title of the Bishop continuing
as before it did) there passed an Act of Parliament 33. H. 8. c. 29 to make the
Deane and Chapter of Lichfeild the sole Chapter for the Bishop.

The Cathedral Church here first built by Oswy King of the Mercians, about the
year 556. who gave unto the Bishops many fair possessions. But that old
Church being taken down by Roger de Clinton, the 36. Bishop of this Diocese,
that which now stands was built by him in place thereof, Anno 1148. and
dedicated to the Virgin Mary and Saint Chad. In following times, and almost in
the infancy thereof, the revenues of it were so fair, that Lichfeild was
thought fit to be the Sea of an Archbishop. And one it had, no more, his name
Adulfus, Anno 783. the Bishops of Winton, Hereford, Sidnacester, Dorchester,
(which two now make Lincoln) and those of Elmham and of Dunwich (both which now
make Norwich) being appointed to him for his Suffragans. But with him and King
Offa who procured it, this great title died. And now it is content to be a
Bishopric, the Diocese whereof contains the whole Counties of Darby, and
Stafford, together with a good part of Warwickshire and Shropshire. In these
are comprehended 557. Parishes, of which 250. are impropriate: for better
government whereof, it has four Arch-Deaconries, viz. of Stafford, Darby,
Coventry, and Shrewsbury. It is valued in the Kings books, 559. li. 18. s. 2.
d. ob. q. and for the Clergies tenth, it comes unto 590. li. 16. s. 11. d. q.
and finally has yielded to the Church three S. to the Realm one Chancellor,
and three Lord Treasurers; to Wales three Presidents, one Chancellor to the
University of Cambridge, and to the Court one Master of the Wardrobe.

SAINT DAVID'S, and the Archbishops and Bishops of it.
SAint David's now the seat of a Suffragan Bishop, was once a Metropolitans S^e
in the Brit^sh Church, and long time the supreme Ordinary of the Wel^h. In the
first planting of the Gospel in King Lucius time, we showed that there were
three Archbishops seats appointed, viz. at London, York, and of Caer-Leon
upon Vsk. That of Caer-Leon upon Vsk was, in the time of Arthur, King of the
Britons, translat^d further off from the Saxons fury, to a place called Men^w,
(Menevia is the Latin name) but since, in memory of David the Archbishop who
so translated it, by us called Saint David's. From the first name it is, these
Bishops use to style themselves, Menevenses. When Austin the Monk first entered
England, the Metropolitan of Saint David's had th^n remaining under his
jurisdiction seven Suffragan Bishops; all which gave meeting to the said Austin
and his Associates, for the composing of some differences which were between
the old and the new-come Christians: viz. the Bishop of Worces^er (Wicctor^m)
Llandaff, Bang^r, Hereford, Llan-Elwy, or Saint As^p^ Llan-Badern, (called in
Latin Paternensis a place in Card^gan shire, the last is called in Latin
Morganensis, which possibly might have his seat in Margan of Glamorgan shire,
a place still so called. Of these, Llan Badern, and this Morganensis are quite
extinct, and have long so been; Hereford and Worcester a long time reckoned as
English Bishoprics, and so none left unto the Metropolitan of S. David's, but
Llandaff, Bangor, and S. Asaphs

Now for these Bishops of Saint David's, we find that 26. of them retained the
title of Archbishops: The last whereof was Sampson, who in a time of
pestilence transferd the Archiepiscopall Pall, and with the same the
Archiepiscopall dignity to Dole in Bretagne, yet his successors, though they
lost the name, reserved the power of an Archbishop: nor did the residue of the
Welsh Bishops receive their consecration from any other hand then his; till in
the time of H. 1. Bernard the 46. Bishop of this See was forced to submit
himself to the Church of Canterbury. For the Cathedral here, it had been often
spoiled and ruined by the Danes, Norwegians, and other Pirates: as standing
near the Sea, in the extreme corner of Pembroke shire. That which we now see
is the work of Bishop Peter, (he was the 48. Bishop of this Diocese) and by
him dedicated by the name of Saint Andrew, and Saint David; though now Saint
Andrew be left out, and David only bears the name. This See has had the
greatest number of Bishops of any in England, 91. in all: and amongst them the
Church has had one Saint, the Realm of England three Lo^d Treasurers, one
Lord Privy Seal; the Un^versity of Oxford one Chancellor, and the Queen
another. The Dioce^e contains the whole Counties of Pembroke, Cardigan,
Carmarthen, Radnor, Brecknocke, and some small parts of Monmouth Hereford,
Mountgomery, and Glamorganshires. In which great quantity of ground there are
no more then 308. Parishes, whereof 120. are impropriate. For the more easy
government of which here are four Archdeacons, viz. of Cardigan, Carmarthen,
Brecknock, and Saint David's. Finally, it is valued in the Kings books, at 457.

ELY, and the Bishops of it.
THe Church of Ely, anciently was a Monastery: first built by Ethelreda wife to
Egfride, King of the Northumbers, and by her planted with religious Virgins,
whereof she made her self the Abbess. But her plantation being supplanted by
the Danes, and the Church quite ruined, Ethelwold Bishop of Winchester did
again rebuild it, and furnished it with Monks good store: to whom King Edg^r,
and the succeeding Kings gave such ample privileges, and fair possessions,
that it did seem to equal any Church in England. Richard the eleventh Abbat
having a mind to quit himself of the Bishop of Lincoln, within whose Diocese
it stood; dealt with King Henry the first, both with purse and Tater noster, to
turn the Abbey into a Cath^drall. And though the King assented to it, and that
the business was transacted with the Bishop of Lincoln, (who had three Manors
of this Abbey, viz. Spaldwick, Biggleswad, and Bockden, in exchange for his
jurisdiction*) yet Richard lived not to possess it, leaving the benefit of his
industry and ambition to be enjoyed by another man, which was one Hervey,
Bishop of Bang^r. As for the Church now standing, it is the work of several
Bishops: the west parts being with great charge repaired by Bishop Rid^ll or
new built rather; as were the Quire and Lantern by Bishop Norwold, which
afterward were fully finished by Bishop Fordham. The whole Church dedicated to
S. Ethelred.

Ely thus made a Bishopric, however fortified with great privileges, (for in
the Isle of Ely the Bishops had all rights of a County Palatine) and that it
was endowed with so great possessions, as hardly any better in the Realm of
England, has yet been subject to those changes which time has wrought. For
many of the Palatine rights were taken off, or much restrained by the Act of
Parliament, touching restoring to the crown the ancient (...), 27. H. 8. c.
25. in the which Act it was enacted, that (instead thereof) the Bishop of Ely,
and his temporal Steward for the Isle of Ely, should from thence forth be
Justices of the peace in the said Island. However Ely may be still reputed
amongst the first Bishoprics of the second rank* and may rejoice it self in
this* that it yielded to this Realm its many great officers as any other in
the Kingdom. For it has given the (...) no less then (...) Lord
Chancellours, seven Lord Treasurers, one Lord Privy Seal, one Chancellor o^
the University of Oxford, one of the Exchequer, two Masters of the Rolls
subesides two Saints unto the Church, two Cardinals to the Church of Rome, and
to the English Court three Almoners. The Dioce^e hereof contains only
Cambridgeshire, and the Isle of Ely* in which there are 141. Parishes* whereof

EXETER, and the Bishops there.
THe Diocese of Exeter contains that in it, which was once two Bishoprics.
For at the first planting of the Church in these western parts, it was thought
convenient to erect two Bishops Sees, the one for Cornwall at S. Germans; the
other for Devonsh* at Cridington, now Kirton, a small Village. But that of
Cornwall, being annexed to Cridington, about the year 1032. both were, not
long after, removed to Exeter, the most noted City of these parts, where it
still continues. Now for the Church of Exeter it was once a Monastery, founded
by King Athelstane, and by him dedicated unto Saint Peter. Edward the
Confessor, removing all the Monks from hence to Westminster, which he had
newly founded and endowed, made it the Bishops See for Devonsh and Cornwall,
then united. The Church as now it stands does owe it self to several
Patrons; the Quire to Bishop Warlwast, the body of the Church to Bishop Quivil,
the side Isles to Grandison: that which is now our Ladies Chapel, being a
remn^nt of the old fabric. The Patrimony thereof once very large, was wasted
and destroyed by Bishop Voisie: who being made Bishop here by King Henry 8.
^ate out the residue of his reign, and all K. Edwards, and some part of Queen
Mary's also. For whereas at his coming hither, he found the Church possessed
of 22. goodly Manors, and 14. Mansion houses richly furnished: he left not
above seven or eight of the worst Manors, and those let out in long leases* and
charged with pensions; and not above two houses, both bare and naked, of which
see Bishop Godwins Catalogue, and Powels History of Wales.

This Diocefe has yielded to the Realm of England, three Lord Chancellours,
two Lord Treasurers, one Lord President of Wales; and to the University of
Oxford, one Chancellor. It contains in it the two Counties of Devon, and
Cornwall, and in them 604 Parish Churches, whereof 239. are impropriate; for
government whereof it has four Archdeacons, viz. of Cornwall, Exeter,
Barnestable, and Tawton. The Bishopric was once valued at 1566. li. 14. s. 6.
d. But since the diminution, or destruction rather, made by Bishop Voisie; it
is now valued at 500. l. just. The Clergies tenth here very high, or mounting
to the sum of 1240. li. 15. s. 2. d. ob. Now for the mar^halling of the Bishops
of this once divided Diocese, we will present you with those of Devonshire and
Cornwall, columne-wise, one against the other, according to their time and
order, until we mere them both in the Church of Exeter. Bishops of Devonsh.

GLOUCESTER, and the Bishops there.
Gloucester was anciently the seat of a British Bishop, whose style sometimes
occurres in the subscriptions of Synodicall Acts, by the name of Cluviensis;
this town being formerly called Clevid, as Camden notes. And I remember that
I have seen in the Palace of Gloucester, the name of said to be Bishop there
in the Britons time. But whether it were so or not; or whether Gloucester were a
Bishopric in those days of old, is not material to our purpose. For that
which was, was brought to nothing by the Saxons, and when they entertained the
faith of Christ, it was first under the authority of the Bishops of Lichfeild,
as afterward of those of Worcester. But in these later days it was dismembered
from that Diocese, and by King Henry 8. made a Bishops See, what time the rest
of new erection were by him founded, as we have spoke before, when we were in
Bristol. Now for the indowment of this Bishopric by him erected, (besides a
Chapter of a Deane, and six Prebendaries by him so founded) he assigned over
all, or most of the lands, unto the ancient Monasteries here, once belonging:
which being first built by Aldred, Archbishop of York, and Bishop of
Worcester, and afterward repaired by Hanley, Farley, Mo^went, Herton,
Trowcester, and Sebroke, several Abbats here, became in fine to be, what it
still continues, one of the fairest Fabrics in the Realm of England. The
Diocese containing only Gloucester shire, has in it 267. Parishes, whereof 125
are impropriations; and one Archdeacon, being called of Gloucester. Valued it is
in the Kings books, 315. li. 17. s. 2. d. according to the estimate thereof at
the first foundation: though in two vacancies which it had in Queen Eliz.
time, much of the lands were taken from it; (for which see what was said before
in the case of Ely.) And for a tenth of all, the Clergy pay unto the King 358.

HEREFORD, and the Bishops there.
HEreford also was of old one of the Bishoprics erected in the Britons time;
first under the Metropolitan of Caer-Leon upon Vske, of Saint David's
afterward, and when these parts were conquered by the Saxon Kings, it came to
be a member of the Province of Canterbury. The Cathedral Church here founded
first by Milfride, one of the Noblemen of this County in honor of Ethelbert,
King of the East Angles treacherously made away by the Queen of Mercia, his
intended mother in law. That which now stands, owes the most part of it
self to Bishop Reinelm; and what he lived not to perform, was finished by his
successors, as they had either means or opportunity. The Diocese hereof
contains the County of Hereford, and part of Shrop-shire; wherein it has
313. parish Churches, of which 166. are impropriations: and for the government
hereof, has two Archdeacons, viz. of Hereford and Salop. It has afforded to
the Church one Saint, to the state two Chancellours, and three Lord Treasurers,
one Deputy to the Realm of Ireland, two Chancellours to the University of
Oxford, and one unto the Queens of England. Finally, it is valued in the Kings
books, 768. li. 10. s. 6. d. ob. q. the tenth of the Clergy coming unto 340.

LLANDAFF, and the Bishops there.
LLandaff is one of the most ancient Bishops Sees either in England or Wales;
and claims a direct succession from the Archbishops of Caerleon upon Vske,
as unto the Bishopric; though for the Metropolitan dignity it be content to
let S. David's have what is left thereof. The first Bishop here, of whom is any
good record, is S. Dubritius, consecrate Bishop of this places by Lupus and
Germanus, what time they came hither out of France, for the extirpation of the
Pelagian heresy. The Church here dedicated to S. Thelians, the next successor
to S. Dubritius; founded upon the River Taffi, and thence called Llandaff;
Llan, in the Welsh tongue, signifying a Church; a Church very well endowed by
the munificence and piety of great persons in those times: so well, that as it
is affirmed by Bishop Godwin, were it possessed now of the tenth part only of
what once it had, it might be reckoned one of the richest Churches in all
Christendom. The ruin of it came in the time of Bishop Dunstan, alias
Kitchen, who thereupon is called fundi nostri calamitas by Bishop Godwin; The
Diocese contains only part of Glamorganshire, and part of Momnouthshire,
though the most of each: and in those parts, 177. Parishes, whereof 98.
impropriations: and for them one Archdeacon, which is called of Llandaff. The
Bishopric is valued in the Kings books, 154. li. 14. s. 1. d. the Clergy
paying for their tenth, somewhat near that sum, viz. 155. li. 5. s. 4. d. It
is to be observed, or may be if it please the Reader, that neither here, nor at
Saint David's, there is any Deane, nor never was in any of the times before us:
the Bishop being head of the several Chapters; and in his absence the
Archdeacon here, as is the Chanter at S. David's. Bishops of Llandaff.

LINCOLN, and the Bishops there.
THe Bishopric of Lincoln, like that of Exeter, was once two Dioceses: the
Bishops of the which had their several seats, the one at Dorchester now a
private Village, seven miles from Oxford; the other at Sianacester, not far
from Gainsburgh, (as Camden thinks) in the County of Lincoln, the ruins of
the which are now invisible. But Sidnacester being in little time united unto
Dorchester; the Bishops See was not long after removed to Lincoln: and that by
reason of a Canon made about that time, viz. An. 1075. by which all Bishops
were enjoined to live in the most famous and conspicuous place within their
Dioceses. Which was the cause, why many of our Bishops did about this time
remove their Sees; as we have seen already, and shall see hereafter. For the
Cathedral Church here, its of no more standing then the removal of the
Bishops See to this place from Dorchester; that which was once here founded by
Paulinus, Archbishop of York, having been long before this time quite
ruined. But when Remigius translated hither the Episcopal Chair, he also
built this Church for receipt thereof. Which being not long after defaced by
fire, was for the most part repaired and beautified by Bishop Alexander, one of
his successors: but brought unto that state in which now it is, by Hugh of
Burgundy, and certain other of the Bishops the Church is dedicated to the
Virgin Mary, and All Saints.

As for the Diocese, it is the greatest still for jurisdiction, and was once
one of the greatest for revenue in all the Kingdom. But for the jurisdiction,
that has been shortened, though at several times: the Bishopric of Ely being
taken out of it by King Henry the first, as those of Peterburgh, and Oxford, by
King Henry 8. yet still it is the largest Diocese in all the Ki^gdome;
containing the whole Counties of Lincoln, Leicester, Huntingdon, Bedford,
Buckingham, and part of Herefordshire. In which great quantity of ground, there
are 1255. Parishes, whereof 577. are impropriations; for government of which
under the Diocesan there are six Archdeacons, viz. of Lincoln, Leicester,
Bedford, Buckingham, Stow, and Huntingdon. The Clergies tenth is answerable
unto this great extent of jurisdictio^, being no less then 1751. li. 14. s. 6.
d. The Bishopric being valued at 894. li. 10. s. 1. d. ob. in the K. books.
Now for the dignity of this seat, we will add but this, that it has yielded
to the Church three Saints, and to Rome one Cardinal; unto the realm of
England six Lord Chancellours, and one Lord Treasurer, and one Lord Keeper;
four Chancellours to the University of Oxford, two to Cambridge; And that the
Bishops here, were heretofore Vice ^ Chancellours to the Sea of Canterbury.
Which being thus premised, I shall proceed in ordering the Bishops here, as I
did at Exeter. Bishops of Sidnacester.

LONDON, and the Bishops there.
LOndon was heretofore the principal of the three Arch-bishopricks amongst the
Britons, and by Pope Gregory was intended to have been so too amongst the
English: but that Saint Austin whom he sent to convert the Saxons, liking of
Canterbury well, resolved to set his staff up there, without going further.
This had before been prophesied by Merlin, that Dignitas Londoniae adornaret
Doroberniam, and was now accomplished. What, and how many were the Archbishops
here, we have no good Constat. Sixteen are named by Bishop Godwin, but with no
great confidence: but howsoever do not come within my compass, who have
confined my self to the Saxons time, in the first infancy of whose
conversion, this City was designed for a Bishops See. The Cathed, Church built
also in those early days by Ethelbert, the first Christian King of all the
English; but afterward much beautified and enlarged by Er^enwald, the fourth
Bishop. Which Church of theirs being 500. years after destroyed by fire: that
which now stands was built in the place thereof, by Mauritiu^, Richardus his
successor, and certain others of the Bishops; a great part of it at their
own charge, the residue by a general contribution over all the Kingdom. And
when it was defaced by fire in the late Queens time, An. 1561. the Qu.
forthwith directed her letters to the Major of London, willing him (as John
Stowe, the City Chronicler reports it) to take order for speedy repairing of
the same: which was done accordingly. The Bishop of this Diocese has
precedencie before all Bishops of the Realm, next the two Archbishops,
together with the dignity and place of Deane, unto the Metropolitan See of
Canterbu^y. The nature of which office is, not only to preside over the rest
of the Bishops at Synodicall meetings, in case the Metropolitan be absent: but
to receive his mandats, for assembling Synods, and other business of the
Church; and having so received them, to intimate the tenor and effect thereof
to the Suffragan Prelates. Examples of the which see in the Acts and Monuments.
And for this Diocese it self, it contains in it the two Counties of
Middlesex, and Essex, with that part of Hertfordshire, which is not in the
Diocese of Lincoln: wherein are reckoned 623. Parishes, and of them 189.
impropriated: for government whereof there are five Archdeacons, viz. of
London, Middlesex, Essex, Colchester, and Saint Al^ans. Valued it is in the
Kings books 1119. li. 8. s. 4. d. the Clergies tenth amounting to the sum of
821. li 15. s. 1. d. Finally, th^s See has yielded to the Church three Saints,
to the State nine Lord Chancellours, six Lord Treasurers, one Chancellor of
the Exchequer, two Masters of the Rolls, besides four Almoners to the Court,
and two Chancellours to the University of Oxford; whose names occur amongst

NORWICH, and the Bishops there.
THe Diocese of Norwich, like those of Exeter and Lincoln, was once two
Bishoprics: the one of Suffolk, whose seat was Dunwich on the Sea shore; the
other of Norfolk, whose See was at North-Elmham, now a poor Village not far
from Repeham. The Bishop of the first was Felix a Burgundian, who first
converted the East Angles. The third from him was Bisus, who finding himself,
by reason of his age, too weak for so great a burden, divided his Diocese into
two, making North Elmham the Episcopal seat for that part of the whole which
we now call Norfolk. Both of them lay long dead in the times of the Danish
fury: that of North-Elmham after an hundred years desolation, ^eviving only;
the other laid to rest for ever. North Elmham thus possessed of the whole
jurisdiction, could not hold it long: the Bishops See being removed to Thelford
first by Herfastus; as afterward from thence to Norwich by Herebert Losinga.
There it has since continued till these very times, though nothing else
continue of it but the Sea alone. For all the lands thereto belonging were
taken from it by King Henry the 8. those which did formerly appertain unto the
Monastery of Saint Bennets in the Holme (by that King dissolved) being assigned
unto it by exchange. For which consult* the Statute, 32. H. 8. 47. in the which
Statute it is said that the lands given in recompense were of a greater yearly
value then those taken from it. So that the Bishop, as it seems, got in
revenue* then, though he lost in privilege. For whereas the Bishops here had
the first f^uits of all the Benefices within the Diocese, by an ancient
custom: that was united to the Crown by Act of Parliament, 26. H. 8. c. 3.

Now for the Church of Norwich, it was founded first by him who first remo^ed
hither the Bishops See, even by Herebertus Losinga; and by him dedicated to the
blessed Trinity: Which being much defaced by fire, (which was it seems, a
common calamity of all the Churches of those times) was afterward repaired by
John of Oxford, the third after him; and once again being fire-touched, by
Bishop Midleton, who brought it to that state in which now it stands. This See
has yielded to the Church two Saints, to the Realm five Chancellours, one
Lord Treasurer, and one Lord Chief Justice, one Bishop Almoner to the Court,
and to the King one principal Secretary of State. The Diocese contains in
the two Counties of Norfolk and Suffolk, 1121. Parish Churches, whereof 385.
impropriate: for better ordering of the which it has four Archdeacons, viz.
of Norwich, Norfolk, Suffolk, and Sudbury. Finally, this Bishopric is valued
in the Kings books, 899. li. 18. s 7. d. ob. The tenth of the whole Clergy
amounting to the sum of 1117. li. 13. s. ob. Now for the line of Norwich it
is thus drawn down. Bishops of the East Angles.

OXFORD, and the Bishops there.
THe Bishopric of Oxford is of new erection, first founded by King Henry 8.
and by him endowed out of the lands belonging to the late dissolved Monasteries
of Abingdon and Osney. It was before a part of the Dio^ese of Lincoln: and
being now made a Bishopric, had first the Abbey Church of Osney (being some
half a mile from Oxford) for its Cathedral, Anno 1541. from whence it was
removed to Oxford about five years after. That which is now the Cathedral,
was anciently dedicated to Saint Frideswide: but being by King Henry made the
Bishops See, was entitled Christ-Church: the Chapter there consisting of a
Deane and eight Prebendaries by him also founded, part of the lands which had
been purchased or procured by Cardinal Wolsey for the indowment of his
College, being allotted thereunto. This Bishopric was founded then, An. 1541.
and from that time, unto the year, 1603. when Doctor Bridges was made Bishop,
are 63, years only, or there abouts: of which it was kept vacant above 40
years even almost all the long reign of Queen Eliz^beth; to the
impoverishing of the Church, before well endowed. The Diocese contains only
the County of Oxford, and therein 195* Parish Churches, of which 88. are
impropriated. It has but one Archdeacon, which is he of Oxford; is valued in
the Kings books, 354. li. 16. s. 4. d. ob. the Clergies tenth coming unto
255. li. 8. s. Bishops of Oxford.

PETERBURGH, and the Bishops there.
THe Bishopric of Peterburgh is of new erection, and taken also out of
Lincoln, as Oxford was. The Cathedral Church was anciently a Monastery, the
place or town of old called Medeshamstede; but on the building of the
Abby-Church, founded by Wol^her King of the Mercians, Anno 633. and by him
dedicated to Saint Peter, it gained the name of Peterburgh. This Church by him
thus built, was after ruined by the Danes, and again built and beautified by
Ethetwoldus Bishop of Winton, Anno 960* or there abouts: upon whose mediation
it was exceedingly liberally endowed by Edgar then King of England; Adulph then
Chancellor to that King, giving unto it also his whole estate. Thus it
continued in a flourishing and fair estate, until King Henry dissolved it*
and having so dissolved it, did by his Letters Patents make it a Bishops See,
and founded also here a Chapter consisting of a Deane and six Prebendaries.
The Diocese hereto allotted, contains the two Counties of Northhampton, (in
the which Peterburgh stands) and Rutland: and in them both 293. Parishes,
whereof 91. are impropriate. It has but one Archdeacon, which is entitled of
Northhampton: is valued in the Kings books 414. li. 19. s. 11. d. the Clergy
paying for their tenth, 520. li. 16. s. 8. d. Bishops of Peterburgh.

ROCHESTER, and the Bishops there.
THe Bishopric of Rochester, is the most ancient next to Canterbury, of all in
England: a Bishops See being here erected by that S. Austin, who first did
preach the Gospel unto the Saxons, Anno 606. which was about ten years after
his entrance into England. The Cathedral Church here, first ^rected by
Ethelbert King of Kent, when it was first made a Bishops See; and by him
dedicated to Saint Andrew: which growing ruinous and dedicated, was afterward
repaired by Gundulp^us, one of the Bishops of the same, about the year 1080.
This Bishopric was anciently, and a long time together, in the immediate
Patronage of the Archbishop of Cauterbury; who did dispose thereof as to them
seemed best; and so continued, till under the pretense of free and capitular
elections, the Popes had brought all Churches into their own hands. However
after this, the Bishops of Rochester owed more then ordinary obedience to their
Metropolitan: and in all solemn Pompes were commonly their Crosse-bearers. The
Diocese hereof is the least in England, containing only a small part of Kent,
and therein not above 98. Parishes, of which 36. impropriate: for ordering of
which jurisdiction, there needed not but one Archdeacon, which is he of
Rochester. Nor is the valuation much, either of the Bishopric, or of the
Clergy: the one being in the Kings books, 358 li. 3. s. ^. d. q. the other
paying for their tenth, the least of any of the English, viz. 222. li. 14. 6 d.
ob. q. And yet this little See has yielded to this Realm, one Chancellor,
one Lord Keeper of the great Seal, and one Lord* Treasurer, and to the Church
of Rome, one Cardinal. The Bishop of this Church writes himself Roffensis.

SALISBURY, and the Bishops there.
THe Bishopric of Salisbury succeeded in the rights of two several Dioceses,
whereof the one had its Cathedral or chiese See at Sherborn, in the County of
Dorset; the other at Wilton, once the chief town of Wiltshire, but since the
growth of Salisbury very much decayed. Of these the ancienter was Sherborn,
whose Diocese extended once over all those Countries, which are now subject to
the jurisdiction of Sal^^bury, Bristol, Wells, and Exeter. But Wells and
Exeter being made peculiar Dioceses, Anno 905. as we there have showed, another
was erected the same time at Wilton also. Which when it had continued under
nine Bishops, and no more, was then again united unto Sherborne; and both
together presently removed to Salisbury, as being the chief City of these
parts, and consequently more fit for a Bishops See. And yet it stayed not long
there neither, being removed again in little time, unto a more convenient
place. For by Herm^nn^^ it was fixed upon the hill, in that old fortified
town, now called old Salisbury: which being found by soon experience to be no
proper seat for a Bishops dwelling; the Sea was presently brought lower, and
with it the town. Herm^nnus who removed the Sea from Sherborne, did first
begin the Church at old Sarum (for so some Latin writers call it) which
Osmund, his successor finished. Rich. surnamed Poor, the fourth-from Osmund,
removed the Sea into the Valley, and first began that Church which we now see
standing: which being finished in the year* 1258. by Bishop Bridport, was ded
cated to the honor of the blessed Virgin.

Thus was the Sea of Sherborne removed to Salisbury, where it has ever since
continued in great fame and luster. As for the privileges of this Church, the
Bishops anciently did claim to be Praecentors to their Metropolitan, and of
more late dues to be Chancellours of the most noble order of the Ga^ter. Which
office being instituted by King Edward 4. and by him vested in the person of
Rich. Beauchamp of Sarum, and his successors in that See: was after in the new
Starutes made by Henry 8. left solely to the Kings disposing, either to
Clergyman or Layman, as to them seemed best. Nor has it been enjoyed by any
Clergyman since that time, though in the year 16^8. it was much labored for

WESTMINSER Bishops, Deans, and Abbats.
THe Bishopric of Westminster, as it related to the Saxons, was of late
erection; and being so erected was of small continuance: but anciently in the
Britons time, the Church there was the Sea for the Archbishop of London. For
whereas some had found in some Record, that the Archbishops See was planted in
the Church of Saint Peter in Cornhill: certain it is, that that was a mistake
for Saint Peter's in Thorney. Now Thorney is the ancient name of that, which is
since called Westminster: and being an ancient Saxon name, was far more
likely to be meant by the first reporter, then that of Cornehill, which is
merely modern. But this Archbishopric being brought to nothing by the
Saxons, Sebert the first christened King of Essex, erected here a Church, where
the former was, and dedicated it unto Saint Peter, as was that before, which
standing Westward of Saint Paul's, was by the common people commonly called
Westminster. This Temple of King Seberts, being in tract of time grown
ruinous, and almost de^erted, Edward the Confessor again rebuilt, and
liberally endowed, and stored with Monks, by him removed hither from Exeter.
After King Henry 3. taking down the fabric of the Confessor, erected it as
now it stands; save that the Abbats much enlarged it toward the West, and
that King Henry 7. built that most goodly Chapel at the East end thereof. The
Abbats here had Archiepiscopall jurisdiction within their liberties, and had
the keeping of the Regalia, and a chief service in the Coronation of the Kings
of England, and place in Parliament: in all which rights, save that of
Parliament, the Deanes now succeed them For when this Monastery (which at the
suppression was valued at 3977. li.) was dissolved by King Henry 8. first he
erected here a Deanrie, Anno 1539. then added to the Deane a Bishop, Anno 1541.
Thi^leby the Bishop, having delapidated all the Patrimo ny to his See allotted;
and robbed S. Peter to pay Paul, as the saying is, was removed to Norwich, and
so the Bishopric determined; having continued nine years only: and
Middlesex, which was the Diocese thereof, was restored to London. Queen Mary
afterward brought in an Abbat, and her foundation being dissolved by Queen
Elizabeth, the made it a Collegiate Church, consisting of a Deane and 12.
Prebendaries, as it still continues. The Bishop, Deanes, and Abbat of
Westminster.

WINCHESTER, and the Bishops there.
THe Bishopric of Winchester (Wintoniensis in the Latin) is of good
antiquity; and never changed the Sea since the first foundation, as all the
rest have done in the South-West parts. The City once the Regal seat of the
West- Saxon Kings. The Cathedral Church first founded and endowed by Kingil,
or Kinegilsus, the first Christian K. of West-Sax: who gave unto it all the
land within seven miles of Winchester. Kinelwalchin, son unto this Kingil, went
forwards with his fathers fabric, ratified his donation, and added to it
amongst other things, the Manors of Alresford, Downten, and Worthy. The Church
now standing was begun by Bishop Walkelin, the work pursued by his successors,
but yet not finished till the time of William de Wickham, who built the
greatest part of the West end thereof. The Chapels on the East end beyond the
Quire, had their several founders. The whole Church dedicated first unto Saint
Amphibalus, then to Saint Peter, after unto Saint Swithin, once Bishop here;
and last of all unto the blessed Trinity, as it still continues. The Bishops
here are Chancellours to the Sea of Canterbury, and Prelates of the most noble
order of Saint George, called the Garter: which office was first vested in them
by King Edward 3. at the first foundation of that Order, and has continued to
them even since. They were reputed anciently to be Earls of Southampton; and
are so styled in the new Statutes of the Garter, made by Henry 8. but that now
otherwise disposed of. Finally what for privilege, and what for large
possessions it was prized so high, that Henry of Bloys, (he was the brother of
King Stephen) once Bishop here, had got a faculty from the Pope, to make it an
Arch Bishops See* seven of the Suffragans of Cante^bury, being allotted
thereunto. And William de Edington, one of the Bishops of this Church, being
elected unto Cante^bury, re^used it, saying, though Canterbury had the highest
rack, yet Winchester had the deep^st manger.

The Diocese hereof contained of old, the Counties of S^rrey, and Sou^hampton,
and the Isle of Wight: to which was added in Qu. Elizabeth's time, the Islles of
Iarsey, Garnsey, Sack, and Alderney, once members of the Bishopric of
Constance in Normandy. Of these the English Isle and Counties contain 362.
Parishes, of which, 131. impropriate: the Isle of Iarsey, 121. and Garnsey with
the other two, as many more. For government of the English part there are two
Arch-Deachns, the one of Winchester; and the other of Surrey: Iar^^y is
governed by a Deane or Commissary, according to the manner of the English
Church; and Garnsey with the Isles appendant, follow the fashions of Geneva.
The Bishopric was anciently valued in the Kings books, 3885 li. 3. s. 3. d.
ob. q. now at, 2793. li. 4. s. 2. d. qa. q. less by a thousand pounds then
before it was: which plainly shows that there has been a great abatement
of the old revenue; The tenth of the Clergy amounts unto, 846. li. 12. d.
Finally, this See has yielded to the Church seven Saints, and to Rome, two
Cardinals; to England, one Lord Chief Justice, six Lord Chancellours, two
Lord Treasurers, one Lord Privy Seal, one Chancellor of the University of
Oxford, another of the Exchequer, and 21. Prelates of the Garter, whose names

WORCESTER, and the Bishops there.
THe Bishopric of Worcester, (Wigorniensis in the Latin) was founded by
Etheldred, King of the Mercians, Anno 679. and taken out of the Diocese of
Lichfeild, of which first it was. The Cathedral Church here, by him also
built; but afterward repaired, or new built rather by several Bishops of this
See. Oswald the eighteenth Bishop here did first undertake it, and casting out
the married Priests, first brought in the Monks, Anno 96^. but his foundation
being ruined by the Danes, the Church was brought to that perfection wherein
now it stands, by Bishop Wulstan, about the year 1030. Since when it ha^h
enjoyed a flourishing and fair estate: and (which is very rare) can hardly
make complaint of any vacancie: save that on the exauctoration of Bishop Heath,
it was assigned over in Commendam to Master Hooper then Bishop of Gloucester.
But it held not long.

This Diocese contains in it the County of Worce^ter, and part of
Warwickshire: and therein ^41. Parishes, of which 71. impropriate* for these
there is but one Archdeacon, which is called of Worcester. Valued it is in the
Kings books, 1049. li. 17. s. 3. d. ob. q the Clergy paying for their tenth,

times of the Sea of Canterbury, the Bishops here were the peculiar Chaplains
of the Metropolitans: and by their Office to say Mass in all assemblies of the
Clergy, wherein he was present. As also that it has yielded to the Church
four Saints; five Chancellours to the Realm of England, and one to Normandy;
Lord Treasurers three, one Chancellor to the Queen then being; one L.
President of Wales, and one Vice President: whom, with the residue of the
Bishops, take here in order. Bishops of Worcester.

THE SECOND PART OF THE CATALOGVE OF BISHOPS, CONTAINING THE SVCCESSION of the
Archbishops and Bishops of the Province of YORK.
Printed at London. 1641.
YORK, and the Archbishops there.
YORK is the ancientest Metropolitan See at this time in England, so made at
the first general admittance of the Gospel in the time of Luctus; the first
Archbishop by him here established, named Sampson, and he who held out last in
the Britons time, being called Tadiacus. We have a constat only of two more,
viz* Taurinus, and Pyrannus: of all the rest no name, or memory to be found
amongst our writers. On the conversion of the Saxons, this See was by Pope
Gregory designed to its former honor: which not long after took e^^ect, when
as Paulinus was made Archbishop of Yo^ke, Anno 622. In which designment of the
said Pope Gregory, the Metropolitan of York, was to have as many Suffragan
Bishops, as he of London (for there the Sea was to be placed by Pope Gregory's
order) to either of them twelve apeece, which if they ever were erected in this
Northern Province, were certainly of mean estate, not able to support the
honor; and consequently, swallowed up by the greater Churches of York and
Durham: which two were only left here a long time together until Carlisle
first was made a Bishopric by K. Henry the first; as Chester afterward by K.
Henry 8. But that which was the greatest addition to the Province of York, was
the direct and Metropolitan jurisdiction which it claimed and had over all the
Bishops of Scotland, who did from hence receive their con^ecration, and swore
Canonical obedience unto this See.

In this regard, and that it was conceived that by Pope Gregory's institution,
he of the two Archbishops which was first confirmed, should have precedencie
over the other: there grew a great contention there abouts, between them, and
much recourse was made to the Court of Rome. At last it was determined in
favor of the Sea of Canterbury: yet so that still it might he lawful to the
Archbishop of York to write himself Prim^te of England; as the other taking
to himself the style of Primate of all England, as it still continues. The
next misfortune which besell the Sea and Metropolitan of York, was that the
Bishops of Scotland did in fine withdraw themselves from his obedience, and had
Archbishops of their own. This happened whilst George Nevill was Archbishop
here, who was advanced unto this See, An. 1466. not above ninescore years
ago: and then upon pretense, that in consideration of the many and most deadly
wars between both Realms, the Metropolitan of York could bear no fatherly
affection to his sons of Scotland. However the Archbishop still retains
his^wonted place, having precedencie before all Dukes, not being of the royal
blood; as also before all the great Officers of state, except the Lord
Chancellor.

For the Cathedral Church of York, it was first built, or begun rather, by
King Edwyn, King of the North-Humbers, Anno 627. but finished by King Oswald
who succeeded him, and dedicated to Saint Peter. But this of their foundation
being destroyed by fire, and by the fury of the Danes, at the first entrance of
the Normans: that which now stands was erected in the place thereof by
Archbishop Thomas (the 25. of this See;) and after, by degrees, adorned and
beautified by his successors. The Diocese hereto belonging, contains in it
the two Counties of York and Nottingham: and in them both 581 Parishes, of
which 336. are impropriations. For government whereof, it has four
Archdeacons, viz. of York, Cleveland, East Riding, and Nottingham. This
Bishopric was at the first rated in the Kings books, 2035. li. 14. s. 6. d.
but now, since the great diminution made by King Henry 8. 1609. li. 19. s. 2.
d. And for the Clergy of the same, their tenth amounts unto 1113. li. 17. s.
9. d. ob. q. To draw unto an end, this See has yielded to the Church eight
Saints, to the Church of Rome three Ca^dinals, unto the Realm of England
twelve LL. Chancellours, and two LL. Treasurers, and to the North of England
two Lord Presidents. The Bishops write themselves in Latin, Eboraunses, of
Eborum, and are these that follow. Archbishops of York.

CARLISLE, and the Bishops there.
THe most of that which does now make the Diocese of Carl^^e, was in the
infancy of the English Church, as I conceive it, part of the Diocese of Whit
herne, or Casa Candida, in the Province of Galloway: now reckoned as a part of
Scotland, but then a parcel of the Kingdom of the North-Humbers. But when the
Scots had mastred all those countries beyond Tweede and Solway, the town of
Carlisle, with the County of Cumberland, in the which it stands, were severed
from that Diocese: Carlisle, with 15. miles about it being bestowed upon S.
Cutbert, Bishop of Lindisfarne, by Egfride, King of the North-Humbers, Anno
679; the residue of the Countty submitting to the jurisdiction of the
Archdeacon of Richmond, then being subordinate the Sea of York. Thus it
contin^ed till the year 1133. what time a Bishops See was here first
established: and by that means, another Suffragan Bishop ^dded to that
Metropolitan. The Cathedral Church he^e had been founded not long before, by
Walter, Deputy of these parts for King William Rufus; and by him dedicated to
the honor of the blessed Virgin but finished and endowed by King Henry the
first, out of that wealth which the said Walter had amassed for that very
purpose, by the persuasion of Athulphus or Athelwolfus, whom aft^rwards he
made the first Bishop there. The Diocese contains the County of Westmorland,
and most part of Cumberland; and therein only 93. Parishes, but those (as all
the Northern are) exceeding large; and of them 18. are impropriate.
Archdeacon here was never any, the jurisdiction being claimed by him of
Richmo^d, as anciently to him belonging. The Bishopric is valued in the Kings
books 530 li. 4. s. 11. d. ob. the Clergies tenth amounting only unto 161.

Chancellours unto the University of Cambridge. Bishops of Carlisle.

CHESTER, and the Bishops there.
THe Bishopric of Chester, as it is here to be considered, is of new erection,
one of those founded by King Henry 8. whereof we spoke before when we were in
Bristol. Anci^ntly it was in the Diocese of Lichfeild, one of the Bishops of
which Church, removing his See hither, Anno 1075. as to the more remarkable and
noted place; occasioned that his successors many times were called Bishops of
Chester. But being severed from that Diocese by King Henry 8. it was erected
into an Episcopal See, made up of the revenue and jurisdiction of the two
Arch-Deaconries of Richmond and Chester: of which the first had jurisdiction
over Richmondshire, and part of Cumberland; the other over Lanca-shire and
Chest-shire. It was at first ^oundation ordained to be of the Province of
Canterbury; and that in the letters Patents of the ^oundation of the same* 33.
H. 8. But the King taking into mind, as well the long distance of the same
from the Sea of Canterbury, as also that the Arch Bishop of Canterbury had a
sufficient number of Suffragans before, whereas the Archbishop of York had
but only two: did in the January following, by Act of Parliament, annex the
same for ever to the Province of York. 33. H. 8. c. 31. The Cathedral Church
here was once a Monastery, founded by Leofricus, once an Officiary Count, in
these parts; and by him dedicated to Saint Wereberg: but repaired, beautified,
endowed, and stored with Monks by H^gh, surnamed Lupus, the first Earl of
Chester. These Monks being ejected by King Hen^^ 8. he brought into their
place a Deane and Prebendaries: and made it of a Monastery, a See Episcopal:
Whose Diocese contains, in the Counties before remembered, 256* Parishes, of
which 101. are impropriations. The Bishopric is valued in the Kings books,

DURHAM, and the Bishops there.
THe Bishops See now fixed in Durham, was first placed in Lind^^arne, a little
Island on the Seacoast of Northumberland: and there placed by the first Bishops
of this Northern region, because of the primacie and solitude thereof, which
made it thought more fit and proper for devotion. But both the Bishop and his
Monks being driven from thence, by the merciless fury of the Danes, (who
here raged extremely) about the year of Christ, 800. they wandered up and down
from place to place for 200. years, not finding any place where they might
repose themselves in safety, till in the end they sat them down in Durham,
Anno 990. or there abouts, where it has ever since continued. The Church here
dedicated to Saint Cuthbert, the 6. Bishop of Lindisfarne, a man of special
renown for piety; whose relics the said Bishops carried up and down with
them in all their wanderings: till at the last they were deposited in this
Church, as in a place of rest and safety. The founder of it, that Aldwinus, by
whom the Sea was first here settled. But his foundation being taken down by
William de Carileso, about the first entrance of the Nor^ans: that which now
stands was begun by him in the place thereof; and finished by Ranulphus
Flambard, his next successor. Somewhat has since been added to it by Bishop
Fernham, and Thomas Weiscomb Pri^ur h^reof, about the year 1242.

Nor did Saint Cu^hbert only give name unto the Church, but also unto all that
country, which now we call the Bishopric of Durham, and anciently was called
Saint Cuthberts Patrimony. For upon (...), and his successors in that See, was
all the country between Tois and Tine, conferred by Alfred King of England:
which his donation was confirmed, and in part increased by his successors,
Edward, Athelstan, and C^ute the Dane. So fortified it was with privileges,
and royal grants, that at the coming in of the Norman Conqueror, the Bishop
was reputed for a County Palatine: and did engrave upon his Seal an armed
Chivalier, holding a naked sword in one hand, and in the other the Bishops
arms. Nay it was once adjudged in law, that the Bishop was to have all
forfeitures and Escheates within the liberties, ut Rex habet extra, as the King
of England had without. But these immunities and privileges were in part
impaired by the Statute of King Henry 8. 27. H. 8. c. 25. and altogether with
the lands and whole rights thereof, conferred upon the Crown by Act of
Parliament, in the last year of the ^aigne of King Edward 6. But in the second
Parliam. of Qu. Mary's reign, that Act was totally repealed, and a reviver
made of the said late dissolved Bishop^* and all the royalties thereof, 1. Mar.
c. 6.

As for the Ecclesiastical jurisdiction, the Diocese thereof contains the
County of Northumberland, and that which properly and distinctly is entitled
the Bishopric of Durham: each of the which has an Archdeacon of its own;
in both, 135. Parishes, whereof 87. impropriate: the Clergy of the which pay
for their tenth unto the Crown, 385. li. 5. s. 6. d. ob. the Bishopric being
valued in the first fruit Office, 1821. li. 1. s. 5. d. qa. The Bishops of this
Church do write them selves in Latin Dunelmenses; of which five have been
dignified with the name of Saints; one with the Patriarchate of Jerusalem, and
one with the title of a Cardinal in the Church of Rome. There have been also
of them, one Lord Chief Justice, five LL. Chancellours, three LL. Treasurers,
one principal Secretary of Estate, one Chancellor of the University of
Oxford, and two Masters of the Rolls. Which we will now lay down in order,
even the whole succession, beginning with those who had their See and
habitation in the Isle of Lindisfarne. Bishops of Lindisfarne.

HEXAM, and the Bishops there.
THe Bishopric of Hexam, Hagul^^ad, or Hextold, was founded in the infancy of
the Saxon Church. The seat thereof called by the old La^ines Axel^dunum, by
Be^a Hagulstadiensis; by us now Hexam: the first who had the name of Bishop
there being S. Eata, the fifth Bishop of Lindisfarne. Ten Bishops it enjoyed
successively, and then by reason of the spoil and ravin of the Danes, it
discontinued: the jurisdiction of it being added to the Sea of York From this
time forwards, Hexamshire was held to be a fee of that Archbishopric, and had
reputation of a County Palatine: but taken from that See by K. H. 8. (of which
consult the Statute, 37. H. 8. c. 16) and by authority of Parliament united to
the County of Northumb. Now for the Bishops of this Hexam, they are these that
follow. A. Chapter 655 1 S. Eata, Bishop of Lindisfarne. 685 2 S. John of Beverley,

MAN, and the Bishops there.
TOuching the Isle of Man, we have spoke already in our first Table. The
Bishopric here of was first erected by Pope Gregory, of that name the fourth,
and for its Diocese had this Isle, and all the Hebrides, or Western Islands
a^ent Scotland. The Bishop has his seat in Russin, or Casletowne, as now we
call it; and in the Latin is entitled Sodo^ensis But when this Isle was made
a member of the English Empire, the Western Isles withdrew themselves from the
obedience of their Bishop, and had a Bishop of their own, whom they entitle
also Sodorensis, but commonly, Bishop of the Isles. The Patronage of the
Bishopric, was given together with the Island, by K. H. 4. unto the Stanleys,
who still keep it: and on the vacancie thereof they nominate their designed
Bishop unto the King, who having given his Royal assent, dismisseth him to the
Archbishop of York for his consecration. This is perhaps the reason why the
Bish. of Man, is no Lord of Parliament, because not at the Kings disposing:
none having suffrage in that house, but those that hold immediately of the King
himself; nor is it reason that they should. Whether the Bishop of this Isle
was anciently a Su^^ragan to the Sea of York, I can hardly say. I find
ordered in the Act of Parliament, 33. H. 8. c. 31. wherein the Bishopric of
Chester was made a member of that Province; that that of Man should be reputed
of it also: which may perhaps persuade one, that it was otherwise before. The
Diocese hereof contains only 17 Parishes, of the which five are Market
Towns; the rest Villages, the people of them all, being very conformable unto
the rites and ceremonies of the Church of England. Now for the Bishops of this
See, I can meet with few: and therefore. shall desire those who are more
conversant in the business of this Isle, to supply this want, and make a
perfect catalogue of the Bishops of Man, out of the fragments here ensuing.

THE THIRD TABLE, OR, A CATALOGVE OF All the Dukes, Marquesses, and Earls,
which have been in England since the first entrance of the NORMANS. TOGETHER
With the honourary Offices which they, or any of (...) have enjoyed in their
several times.
The Preface to the ensuing Catalogne of Dukes, Marquesses, and Earls.
THe Kings of England as they are the fountain of all authority and
jurisdiction in their own Dominions: so are they the foun^aine also of all
civil honor; which they dispose of and dispense, as to them seems best.
King^ have so much of God in them, whose Deputies they are on earth, as many
times where they find merit and desert, to raise the poor out of the dust,
that they may set them with the Princes, even with the Princes of their people.
Now for their honourary attributes, which by our Kings have been conferred
upon their Subjects; the ancientest are those of Earl and Baron: the Kings of
England, of the Norman race, not giving unto any the style of Duke, until that
Edw. the third, created his son Edward the black Prince, Duke of Cornwall,
Anno 1336. As for the title of Marquess, that was made honourary by King
Richard the second, who first created his great favorite, Robert de Vere, then
Earl of Oxford, Marquess of Dublyn: as afterward he made his Cosen German,
John de Bausort, one of the sons of John of Gaunt, by Katherine Swinfort,
then Earl of Somerset, the first Marquess Dorset. But that of Earls has
been as ancient in this Kingdom, as the line of Normandy. William the
Conqu^r^r advancing many to that honor at his first en^^ance on this State,
both to reward them for their service, and oblige them to him. Of which rank
were the Earls of Arund^ll, Chester, Cornwall, Kent, Oxford, with some others,
Anno 1067. being the next year after he attained the Kingdom. Which with the
other Earls of ancient creation, were commonly endowed de tertio denario
placitorum Comitatus, with the third penny of the pleas of that County whereof
they were Earls the other two parts being accounted by the Sheriff (the
Vice-Comes) into the* Exchequer, for the Kings use. And though we mean to go no
lower in our following Catalogue, then the style of Earl; yet by the way we
may take notice, that Viscount here became an honourary title in the time of K.
H. 6. who in the 18. of his reign advanced Sir John Beaum^nt unto that honor,
and gave him place above all Barons, as Richard 2. gave his new Marquesses
precedencie before all Earls. Now at the ennobling of deserving persons into
these high dignities, it is, and has been of later times the custom of the
Kings of England, to give unto them some set pension for the support of their
estate: which is now generally brought unto this proportion, that Viscounts
have a fee of 20. marks, Earls of 20. li. Marquesses of 40. marks, and Dukes
of 40. li. assigned unto them, out of some part or other of the Kings revenues.
Which bounty I observe not to have been used in the creation of a Ba^on,
excepting only that it pleased his sacred Majesty now being, when he created
the righ^ honorable Montjoy Blount (now Earl of Newport) L. Montjoy of
Thurleston, in the County of Darby, to give unto him and his heirs, a fee of
20. marks per annum* which I note here, by reason of the singularity and
rareness of it.

Nor have the Kings of England been ^^customed to frame new honourary titles,
for the advancement of those men which are dear unto them: but to prefer them
before others of the same honourary rank and order* Henry the sixth bearing
especial affection unto Henry Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, first made him the
prime Earl of England, or Praecomes Angliae. And when he after made him Duke
of Warwick, he ordered him to have precedencie, next after the Duke of
Norfolk, and before the Duke of Buckingham. The ^ame King Henry making his
halfe-brother Edmund of H^dham, Earl of Richmond, gave him the place above all
Earls, and next of all unto the Dukes. Thus did King James of blessed memory
confer upon the Earl of N^^tingham, (on his surrendry of the place and
Office of Lord Admiral) the seniority and precedencie of the Mowbraies, (out
of which house he was extracted) during the life of the said Earl. And thus
his sacred Majesty now being, when he created the right honorable the Vis^ount
Walling ford, Earl of Banbury, gave him precedencie before all Earls, created
since his Majesty's happy coming to the Crown. And in the Patent of creation
of the right honorable the Lord Montjoy, 3. Can there was a clause of
precedencie inserted, before all the Barons of that year, by which he
forthwith had the place both of the Lord Craven, and the Lord Falconbridge,
though created before him. So absolute a power have our English Monarchs in the
dispensing of their honors, and ma^shalling those persons whom they have
advanced to these high dignities.

As for the Female sex, they have no reason to complain that they have been
neglected or omitted in the distributing of these honourary rewards and
dignities: some of them having had the happiness to taste the bounty of the
Prince in the highest honors. For thus the Lady Margaret d^ Brotherton,
daughter of Thomas of Brotherton, Earl of Norfolk, was by King Richard the
second, made Duchess of Norfolk, Anno 1398. And thus the Lady Anne Bullen,
daughter of Thomas Earl of Wil^s, was by King Henry 8 made Marchioness of
Pembroke, Anno 1532* as was the Lady Margaret, daughter of Georg^ D. of
Clarence, created Countess of Salisbury by the same King Henry; Anno 1514*
Thus also the Lady Elizabeth Finch, being by King James created Viscountesse
M^idstone, was by our gracious Sove^a^gne Lord now being, created Countess of
Winchelsey, Anno 1628. the dignity entailed on the heirs males of her body
hegotten. And finally, thus was the Lady Elizabeth Richardson, wife of Sir
Thomas Richardson Lord Chief Justice, created Baroness Cramont, by his
Majesty now re^gning not to say any thing of the Lady Mary Fane Baroness
Despencer, or of the Lady Margaret Lennard, Ba^onesse Dacres of the South;
being restitutions rather then creations.

Now for the method which I am to use in this following Catalogue, it shall be
after the most natural of the Alphabet; as being of most ease and speediest
use in finding what we have a mind to look for. And in the same I shall lay
down the just successions of and in each several title, (premising first a
brief description of the plac^ denominating) together with the year of Christ's
nativity, wherein each several Duke, Earl, or Marquess either succeeded in
the place, or was advanced unto the same. I also shall report in brief, on
what pretext of blood such and such men attained those honors which they have
enjoyed; If any neernesse or descent of blood was pretended by them: and where
a family breaks off, and a new comes in, that I have marked with a few crosses
thus. I have observed also who and how many of each title have managed any of
the great and honourary Offices in the Commonwealth: as those of Lord high
Steward, Lord high Chamberlain, Lord ^^^^table, Lord Admiral, Lord
Chancellor, Lord Treasurer, Lord Chief Justice, or Lord Privy Seal;
together with the Lord Steward, and Lord Chamberlain of hi^ Majesty's
household, and the LL. Presidents of York and Wales, and Chancellours or either
o^ the Universities. Such of them as have had the honor to be admitted into
the Order of the Garter, I have noted with this little ^sterisme *. And all
this I have done (...) much brevity as was possible* (...) nothing in this
place but a Nomenc^^tor* a (...) and naked Catalogue of names and ho^ours, for
the more easy understanding of o^r English History, which was the matter which
first moved me to compose (...) Tables. As for the order of precedencie of the
men themselves, that are thus dignified and advanced, as now they stand; that
is to be accounted from and by the seniority of their creations in their
several series: save that a course was took in Parliament, 31. H. 8. c. 10.
for placing those above the rest, which were entrusted with the greatest
Offices of State and Court. As, viz. that of the Lord Chancellor, or Lord
Keeper, Lord Treasurer, Lord President, Lord Privy Seal, Lord Constable, Lord
high Chamberlain, Lord Admiral, Lord Marshall, together with the Lord
Steward, and Lord Chamberlain of his Majesty's household. Which manner of
precedencie being it is personal, as unto the men, and has no reference to
their place and titl^^, (...) and (...) with the times, according as they (...)
and favor with their (...) and Soveraign^. But for the places which have given
(...) and title to Dukes, Marquesses, or Earls; and for the men that have
been honored with those titles, they are th^se that follow: taking along such
Lords, and Viscounts, as have, ^eene dignified with and by the selfsame
titles, and no more but those.

Saint Albans.
S. Albans is the fairest and the goodliest town in the County of Hertford. It
arose out of the ruins of old Verulamium, a town more strong and ancient
^arre, (as being the strongest Fort of all the Britains, in the time of
Caesar) though not hai^e so beautiful. It took both name, original, and
Grandour, from Alban, once a Citizen of Verulamium: who suffering Martyrdom
for the faith of Christ, during the persecution of Dioc^^^ian; had first a
fair Church built in memorial of him, in that very place: or if you will,
Ecclesia mirandi operis, atque ejus martyrio condigna, in the Authors language.
( Bedae hist. lib. 1. c. 7). But this Church and town of Verulam being both
destroyed, in those fierce wars, which were between the Saxons and the
Britains, Offa the great and puissant K. of the Mercians, built not far off
from the old seat, a Monastery to the honor of Saint Alban; endowed it with a
great revenue, and many goodly privileges, as well Ecclesiastical as
Temporal. This in short time, improved the Monastery into a town: the Abbat
in regard of his great possession^, and jurisdiction correspondent, drawing no
ordinary con^^^ence of all sorts of people, Pope Adrian, borne at
A^bats-Langley, about five miles off, added this honor to the place, that as
Saint Alban was the first Martyr of the Engllsh nation: so should the Abbat
have precedencie of all English Abbats. This house was valued at the
suppression, at 2510. li. 6. s. 1. d. per annum* and was surrendered into the
hands of Sir Thomas Pope, Doctor Petre, and Master Cavendish, for the use of K.
H. 8. December. 5. Anno 1639. The Abbey Church being a stately and magnificent
fabric is le^t standing still* townsmen purchasing the same at the price of
400. li. and turning it into a Parish Church, as it now remains. For the great
battles fought about this town, and in the very streets thereof, between the
two contending houses of York and Lancaster; I leave you to the common
Chronicles. The persons which it has ennobled, are these that follow.

Anglesey.
ANglesey is an Island of North Wales, situate over against Carna^vonshire, from
which it is divided by a narrow straight: called in the Latins Mona, by the
Britains Mon; but being conquered by the English, obtained the name of
Anglesey, as one would say, the Island of the Englishmen. It is exceeding
fruitful both in corn and cattle, from whence the Welsh are liberally stored
with both: And therefore it is said proverbially, Mon mam Cymbri, that Anglesey
is the mother of Wales. It was the ancient seat of the Druides, and brought
with no small difficulty under the command of the Romans, by Julius Agricola*
the people fighting here, ut pro aris and focis, for their religion and their
gods. It contains in it 74. Parishes, the principal whereof is named
Beau^arish, being at this time the head town of ^he shire: and Aberfraw, now
an obscure and ^omely place, but anciently the Royal seat ^f the Kings of
North Wales. The persons which it has given title to are only these. Earls
of Anglesey.

ARundell is the name of an ancient town and Castle in the County of Sussex,
pleasantly seated near the river of Arun: whence it was called Arundale, or
A^untina va^^^^, in some Latin Authors. The Castle of great fame and strength;
but far more famous for the Lords and Earls thereof, then the strength or
beauty. A place in this far different from the rest of England: the title of
the Earl of Arundell, being annexed unto the Castle, honor, and signeurie of
Arundell; and going along with the possession of the same: as was adjudged in
that great controversy, between Sir John Fitz-Alan, being in possession of the
Castle, against Iohn-Mowbray ^. of Norfolk, being the right heir in the
nearest degree. The Earls here of in regard that by ancient Charter they had
had the ^ertium denarium, or the second penny of the Plees of Sussex; and that
they sometimes had their residence and abode in Chichester, as the chief City
of that County: are in some old Charters ^alled Earls of Sussex; and in some
others, Earls of Chichester. That which was theirs most properly, has stayed
longest by them* and is of late increased by the addition of the titles and
dignities of the Baronies of Fitz-Alan, Clun, Oswaldstree, and Mal^raver^ with
diverse other lands, tenements, and here ditaments, annexed unto the title,
name, an^ dignity o^ Earl of Arundell, by special Act (...) Parliam. An. 3.

AVmerle, or A^bemarle, is the name of a small town and territory in the
Dukedom of Normandy. It belonged heretofore to Stephen, the son of Odo,
des^^nded from the Earls of Champagne: whom William the Conqueror made Earl
of Albema^le, as being the son of his half sister by the mothers side; and
gave unto him for the further maintenance of his estate, the territory of
Holder^^sse in Yorkshire. This title he enjoyed, and left the same to his
posterity, who enjoyed it also. And when his issue failed, the Kings of England
honored others with it; though they had long since lost their estate in
Normandy: the Dukes and Earls whereof, take thus in order. Dukes and Earls of
Aumerle.

BAnbury is a town in Oxfordshire, the second both for wealth and beauty in
all that County: Most famous in our common Chronicles, for the great battle
there-by fought between the two great houses of Lancaster and York: in which
the victory fell to the Ear of Warwick, then chie^e of the Lancastrian party,
who forthwith took King Edward prisoner (of that name the fourth) now forlorn
and hopeless. It was not long since much wasted by a devouring fire, but very
well repaired and beautified; and still is as it has been anciently, cas^o
conficiendo notissimum, as Camden notes it, a town much famed for the best and
most delicate sort of Cheeses. It never had but one Earl, and he 1626 1
William, L. Knollys, Visc. Wallingford, created E of Banbury, Aug. 18. and
died, Anno 1631.

BAthe, is the fairest, and the principal City in all Somersetshire, seated in
a very low Plain, and round about environed with hills very high and steep:
from whence come many rivulets and fresh water springs, to the great commodity
of the people. But that which brings most wealth unto the place, are not the
waters from without, but those waters which are within; sending up from them
much thin vapors, and a strong sent withal; which springs are very
medicinable unto many maladies. Three of these springs there are in all, the
waters of the which being received in large and fitting receptacles for the
public use; they call the Kings Bath, the cross Bath, and the hot Bath. From
bathing in these waters, it was called the Bath; and thence Batho^ia in the
Latin: unless perhaps you rather think that bathing took its hint from
hence; and that this place took name from Badon, or mons Bado^icus, not far
off, as certainly Caer Badon, the old Britain^ called it. The Greeks and
Latins gave it names according to the nature and condition of the waters, or
the Baths there being: it being called by Ptolomee, (...), hot waters; by
An^oninus, ^quae solis the waters of the Sun, on ^he self same reason. Of
the ^aire Church here we have spoke already in our description of the
Bishopric: which being ruined amongst other Monasteries in the time of K. H.
8. has of late times been, as it were reedified, but certainly repaired, and
beautified, and made (...) for use, by the great costs of Bishop Montague, a
late Bishop there. Earl it had none until the time of H. 7. since it has had
diverse; whose names and times we now present you. Earls of Bathe.

BEdford is one of those three Counties which anciently were possessed by the
Cattieuc^lani* the Country indifferently well provided of all necessaries,
both for food and fuel. It takes denomination from the chief town thereof,
called Bedford, or in the old Saxon, Bedanford, i.e. Beds, or Innes at the
Ford. A town conveniently seated on both sides of a river which runs
through it; well built, and populous, as having in it no less then five
Churches. But the chief commendations which it has, is for the antiquity and
strength thereof; as being a town of no small note and consequence, Anno 572.
when as Cuthwulf the Saxon vanquished the Britain^ in the open field, and
became Master of the Country. The Castle here being counted very strong, and
almost impregnable, brought no small mischeife to the place, being a piece much
aimed at by all those in the former times, which either pretended to the Crown,
or bate arms against it. But all the fortifications being demolished in the
reign of K. H. 3. the people have since lived in quiet: and the chief
reputation of it now consists in this, that it has given the title of Dukes
and Earls to these persons following, being in their several ages Dukes and
Earls of Bedford.

BErkley is the name of a noble and an ancient family, dispersed in many places
of this Kingdom. They took this name from Berkley Cas^^^* situate near the
Severne banks in the County o^ Gloucester, of which they were made Barons by
King H. 2. Whereas before that time they were called Fitz-Harding; as being
descended from one Robert Fitz-Harding of the blood (...) of the Danes. Which
Robert Fitz-Harding by the name of Robertus f^^ius Ha^dingi (...) Reg^^ Dacae,
is joined as a Co-founder with (...) H 2 of the Cathedral Church of Bristoll,
(but then a Monastery only) as does appear by an inscription over the gate of
the said Church. William L. Berkley of this house, being descended from the
Mowbraies, who amongst other titles were Earls of Nottingham, was in the year
1482. created Visc. Berkley by King Richard 3. afterward Earl of Nottingham,
and Earl Marshall by King H. 7. and finally, created Marqu. Berkley by the
same King H. A^no 1509. But dying without issue all those titles ended with
him: that of the Lord Berkley still continuing in the line collateral. Visc.
and Marqu. Berkley.
1509 1 Will. L. Berkley, created Viscount Berkley, by King R. 3. was created
Marqu. Berkley by K. H. 7. mort sans issue.

BErkshire was anciently in the Saxon times called Berro^schire: which name the
learned Antiquary Master Camden out of Asserius Menevensis deriveth from
Berroc, a certain Forest, where grew good store of Box, to which the people
used in the time of danger to retire themselves. I lies conveniently all along
the banks of the river of Thames, which serves them well for the conveyance of
their corn, fuel, and other commodities to the City of London: and
contains in it 140. Parishes, of the which 12. are Market towns; the chief,
Reading, and Abington. But that which gives most luster to it, is the royal
Palace and Castle of Windsore, the principal seat and residence of the most
honorable order of the Garter: and indeed the most magnificent mansion of the
Kings of England. Camden in his description of this County does conclude it
thus. Thus much of Barksh* which (as yet) has given the title of Earl to no
man. And true it was when he so said it. But since it has bestowed that title
on these: Earls of Berks.
1620 1 Francis L. Morrys, crea. E of Berkshire, Jan. 28. mort sans issue
masle. 1625 2. Tho. Howard, Visc. Andover, created E. of Berksh. Feb. 7. now
living. Anno 1641.

BRIDGEWATER.
BRidgewater, but more properly and in the old records Burgh-Walter, that is,
Walters Burgh, so called of Walter de Duaco, who came in with the Normans, and
had fair lands given him in these parts by the Conqueror; is a town of
Somersetshire. A great and populous town it is, descending by the Chaworths to
the Duchy of Lancaster: and was by Hen. 8. the heir of the Lancastrian
family, adorned with the tlitle of Earldom; which he bestowed on Sir Henry
D^wbeney, son of that Giles Dawbeney, who came in with King Hen. 7. from
Britain in France; and was by him made his L. Chamberlain, and Knight of the
Garter. Which Henry dying without issue, this title lying long a sleep, was
afterward awakened in another family, ordained to be a seminary for the Earls
of Bridgewater. A. Chapter 1538 1 H^nry L. D^wbeney created Earl of Bridgewater.
30. H. 8. 1617 2 John Egerton Visc. Brackly, created ^. of Bridgewater, May 15

BRISTOL.
BRistol the third in rank of the Cities of England, is situate on the rivers
of F^ome and Avon, not far off from the entrance of the Severne into the Oc^an.
In that regard it stands commodiously for trade and trafick, the ships with
full sail coming up into the bosom of the City; and verily the Cityzens
there are wealthy Merchants, and trade into the most part of the world with
good faith and fortune. Part of it stands in Somersetsh. and part in Gloc^ster
shire, though they account themselves of neither: being a County in it self
incorporate, and independent upon any other than its own Officers. A town
exceeding populous, and exceeding cleanly: there being sinks and sewers made
under ground, for the conveyance of all filth and nastinesse, which by them
passes into the rivers. The Castle of it once was a place of strength, and in
it K. Stephen was kept a prisoner by Maud the Empress: but now not able to
defend it self from the ruins of time. Churches it has in it, and thereto
adjoining, to the number of 18, or thereabouts, whereof the fairest and most
memorable, next to the Cathedral (of which we have already spoken in our
description of the Bishopric, is S. Ma^ies of Radcliffe, without the walls,
esteemed to be the fairest Parish Church in England, yet however it has long
been a town of Fame; it is not full an hundred years, since it was made a
Bishops see: But less since it became a title of nobility; viz. not till King
James conferred the honor of Earl of Bristol, on 1622 John L. Digby of
Sherborne, cr. E. of Bristol, Sept. 15. Iac 20. now living 1641.

BVCKINGHAM.
BVckingham is another of the three Counties, which were once the seat of the
Cat^ieuchlani: and is supposed to take that name from Bucken, that is,
Beech-trees, with which the Country is well stored. It is generally a very
rich and plentiful soil, equally good for corn, and grazing, and lies al
along on the bank of the Thames, confronting Bark-shire. It conteines in it,
185 Parishes, eleven of the which are market towns; and amongst them the
chief in name is Buckingham, the head town of the County. A town of no great
note, when it was at the best; but more considerable heretofore, than at the
present; being once fortified with a Castle, now hardly to be found in the
very ruins, as also with a rampire and certain sconces, built for defense
thereof against the Danes, now more invisible than the Castle. The greatest
honor it can challenge, is that it has given titles of the highest honor, to
many a brave and worthy personage, as well of the blood Royal as of other
families: who by the Kings of England have been hence denominated. Dukes, Marq.
and Earls of Buckingham.

BVLLINGBROKE.
BVlling broke is an ancient town in Lincolnshire, heretofore belonging to the
Lacies E. of Lincoln: and by the marriage with Alice daughter and heir of
Hen. Lacy E. of Lincoln, to Thomas E. of Lancaster; this with the residue of
the lands of Lincoln, became united and incorporated with those of Lancaster.
The greatest fame thereof; was for a Castle built there by William of Romara,
E. of Lincoln: but much more famous in succeeding times, in that it was the
birth place of K. H. 4. surnamed (according to the fashion of that age) of
Bullingbroke.) It has been almost eversince his time, one of the honors (as
we call it) of the crown of England: but never made an honorarie title unto any
family, until K James conferred it on Sr. Oliver S. John's who possibly might
affect to be thence denominated, as fetching his descent from the Lad^e
Margaret Beauchamp, grandmother to King Henry the 7. the heir of the
Lancastrian Family. Earl of Bullingbroke.
1624 1 Oliver L. S. John of Bletho, created E. of Bullingbroke, Iac. 22. Dec.
28. Nowliving, 1641.

CAMBRIDGE.
CAmbridge-shire was once part of the pos^essions of the old Iceni, and takes
that name from Cambridge the chief town thereof; and that derived either from
the old town called Camb^ritum, which Antoninus mentions in this tract, or
else, as other have conceived, from a bridge built on the river came, on whose
banks it ^tandeth. A town that has been long since dedicated unto learning:
here being a public School erected An. 630 or thereabouts, by Sebert King of
the East Angles, and that ad morem Cantuariorum, as it is in Beda. But Schools
and studies being overthrown by the Danish fury, it lay long forlorn and
discontinued, till it began to flourish under the calmer times of the Normans
government, that is to say, about the middle of the reign of K. H. the first,
the 3 K* of the Norman Kings. Nor was it long before, that of a famous School,
or Schola illustris, as we phrase it now, it did become as famous an
University: Robert de Remington affirming, that in the reign of Edward the 1
it was made an University such as Oxford is, by the Court of Rome. There are
now 16 Colleges and Hals endowed, replenished with such store of students, that
unless it be in her sister Oxford, the like are not found in all Europe. But
we must leave this speculation of it as an Academy; and look upon it next as a
title of honor: in which consideration we shall find it no less fortunate,
than we did before, in these Earls of Cambridge. 1 William de Meschines, son
to Randolph E of Chester. 1342 2 John de Hainal^ uncle to Qu. Philip, wife of
Edw. 3. 1349 3 William Marq* of Iuliers. 1362 4 Edm. of Langley D. of York.*
1401 5 Edw. Plantagenet D. of York. * 1414 6 Rich. de Conisburgh, 2 son of Edm.

15. Lord Steward. * 1625 8 James Marq. Hamilton, Master of the horse, and now
E. of Cambridge, 1641 *

CARLISLE.
Carlisle is the principal City in the County of Cumb^rland, situate in the
furthest part of the Kingdom toward Scotland, on the Western marches:
fortified with a Citadel and sundry Bulwarks for a defense against the Scots,
as standing in a place of most advantage for the securing of that border. It
flourishedheretofore in the time of the Romans, and was by them called
Lugu-vallum, as standing on the Trench, or Vallum Picticum, the Picts wall, as
our stories call it; made by the Romans to defend their Province from the Picts
and Scots. So that it seems of old to have been the boundary between the
nations: though the Northumbers after, in the Saxon times, enlarged their
Empire to the banks of Dunb^itton Fryth. From whence, or when it first was
called Carl^le, our Authors say not; but by that name, and in the Latin by
Ca^l^olum, it h^th long been known. The Danes consumed it into ashes, and it
lay unrepaired in rubbish, til the time of Willi^m Rufus, who rebuilt it. Since
which by the accession of the Episcopal See, erected there by H. the first,
who succeeded Rufus; it came to be of wealth and cre^it: and has given the
title of an Earldome to two several Families, which being of a different
quality, have in as different times been Earls of Carlisle. Earls of Carlisle.
1321 1 Andrew de Harcla. 1622 2 James Hay, Visc. Doncaster, created E. of
Carlisle, 18. Iac. Sept. 17* 1636 3 James Hay now E. of Carl^le, 1641.

CARNARVON.
CArnarvon is a shire of North Wales, butting upon the Irish seas, and pa^ted
from the Isle of Anglesey by a streit, or Fretum. A mountainous and rocky
Country: but the defects thereof are plentifully supplied by the Isle
adjoining. It took name from Carnarvon, the chief town there of: heretofore
very strongly wailed, and for^ified with a fair Castle. Edward the 2. K. of
England was here borne; and hence according to the custom of those times,
entitled Edward of CARNARVON. For the occasion of it I refer you to the common
Chronicles. The Princes of Wales had in this place their Chancery and Exchequet
for all North Wales: which was no small improvement to it. Earl it had never
any till the present Age, in which our Sovereign Lord now reigning conferred
that title on 1628 1 Rob. L. Dormer of Wing* created E. of Carnarvon 4. Car.
Aug. 2. now living, Anno 164^.

CHESTER.
CHester is the principal City of Cheshire, anciently part of the Cornavii.
The Country not so plentiful in corn, as in fish and cattle; but fruitful
in no one thing more than the production of ancient Gentry; of which it can
still show more ancient Families than any one County in the Kingdom. The City
built in form of a quadrant, fouresquare, is enclosed with a wall that takes
up more than 2 miles in compass, and has 11 Parishes; the houses being very
fair, and well built, and having all along in the chief streets before the
doors, a kind of galleri^; through which a man may walk dry from one end to the
other. Seated it is upon the river of Dee, on which, to show his splendour and
magnificen^e, K. Edgar was once rowed by 7 petie ^ings of the Scots and
Britans, to the great joy of the beholders. The Earls hereof were anciently
accounted Palatines. William the Conqueror giving this Earldome to Hugh Lupus,
a noble Norman; to be holden as fre^ly by his sword, as the King himself held
England by his own. And though it be now, and has long been incorporated into
the Patrimony regal; yet it still holds the rights and privileges of a County
Palatine: and has for the administration thereof, a Chamberlain, a Justice
for the Common^ plees of the Crown, two Barons of the Exchequer, a Sheriff, an
Eschetour and other Officers; to the great case of all the countryin expedition
of their business. The Palatines hereof, before it came into the Crown, are
these here following, Earls of CHESTER.
1067 1 Hugh surnamed Lupus. 1103 2 Richard son of Hugh. 1120 3 Randolph de
Meschines. 1129 4 Randolph de Gernoniis. 1153 5 Hugh Kivilioc, son of Randolph.
1181 6 Randol. Blondeville son of Hugh. 1233 7 John le Scot, son to the Lady
Maud eldest sister of Randolph. 1245 8 Edw. eldest son of K* H. 3. 1255 9 Simon
de Montford, Earl of Leicester, after whose death Chesler was laid unto the
Crown; and has been since united to the Principality of Wales: so that who
list to see the residue of the Earls of Chester, shall find them in the former
Catalogue of the Princes of Wales, which have been of the Royal blood of
England.

CHESTERFEILD.
CHesterfield is a town of Darbysh. commonly called Chester^eild in Scardale. A
town, which by the ruins of it does seem to be of good antiquity; and
therefore likely to have had some more ancient name, which seems to be now
buried in those ruins; or by continuance of time, quite worn out and lost. It
glories much of being made a free Borough, in the time of K. John; and for
the battle fought hard by between K. Henry the 3, and his rebellious Barons,
in which Rob. de Ferrers, Earl of Darby, being taken prisoner, lost his Estate
and Dignity, though not his life. But that in which it has most cause to
glory, is that from an ordinary Market Town, it is become the seat of an
Earldome, the style and title of Earl of Chesterfeild, being conferred by our
dread Sovereign now being, upon 1628 1. Philip Lord Stanhop of Shelford, or
Earl of Chesterfeild. 4 Car. Aug. 4 and is now living, Anno 1640.

CLARE and CLARENCE.
CLare is an ancient Town on the edge of Suffolk, where it joyneth to Essex,
seated not far off from the banks of the river Stoure by which the Counties are
divided. A Town that has not any thing whereof to boast (the Castle and the
Collegiall Church being both in rubbish) but that it gave both name and title
unto that noble Family, si^named De Clare; who in their times were Earls of
Hartford, Clare and Gloucester. But the male issue of these Clares being
failed, Lio^el the 3 son of K. Edw. the 3. (having married the sole daughter
and heir of William de Burgh, E. of Vlster in Ireland, begotten on the body of
Elizabeth, one of the sisters and coheires of Gilbert de Clare, who died Anno
1291, the last E. of Clare and Gloucester of that name) was made Duke of
Clarence; the termination of the title, being only changed, not the place
denominating. And from the change thus made (which I note only by the way) the
second king of Arms is surnamed Clarentieux; as apperteining formerly to the
Dukes of Clarence: whom with the Earls preceding and succeeding, take in order
thus; Dukes and Earls of Clarence.
1139 1 Gilbert E. of Clare. 1152 2 Roger de Clare. 1174 3 Richard de Clare,
after whose death, this title lay long drowned in that of Gloucester. 1362 4
Lionel, D. of Clarence, 2 son to K. Edw. the 3. 1411 5 Tho. D. of Clarence, 2
son to K. H. the 4. L. Admiral. 1461 6 Geo. D. of Clarence, brother to K. Edw.
the 4* L Constable. 1624 7 John Hollys Lord Houghton, cr. E. of Clare, Com.
Suffolk, 22. Iac. Nov. 2. 1638 8 John Hollys now Earl of Clare, 1641.

CLEVELAND.
CLeveland, is a wapon-take or hundred in the northriding of Yorkshire, taking
that name as Camden tells us, of the steep banks which we call Clyffes, which
run all along the side thereof, and at the foot of which the Country spreads
into a plain full of fertile fields. It seems to be a place of a fair
extent, as being one of those 3 Arch-deaconries into which the whole County is
divided; and does give the title of an Earl, to 1625 1 Thomas L. Wentworth
created E. of Cleveland, 1 Car. Feb. 7. who does still enjoy it, An. 1641.

CORNWALL.
COrnwall is the most western part of England, and takes denomination from the
shape and fashion of it, being like an horn; which the old Britans called
Kern, as now the Welsh call the country Kernaw. The people of it are a
remainder generally of the ancient Britans; whose language, for much of it,
they do still retain: although by intermixture of the Saxons, not easy to be
understood by the Welsh themselves. The Country very mountainous, as Wales is
also; and therefore of the less access to the Conquering Saxons: but the
sea-costs well beautified with goodly towns, able to set to Sea, a good Fleet
of ships. And for the mountains, they do recompense their defects without,
by their abundant wealth within; as being very full of mines of tin, which
yields great profit to the Country, and furnishes* most parts of Christendom
with that commodity. The Earls of Cornwall heretofore gave great immunities
and liberties to those that labored in these mines; and when this Earldome
fell again unto the Crown, Edw. the 3 erected a L. Warden of the Stannaries, to
have the government thereof. And at that time of its reverting to the Crown,
the L. K. Edw. gave it to his son, surnamed the black Prince; since the which
time, the eldest sons of the Kings of England, whether it be by birth, or by
the death of their Elder brothers, are ipso facto Dukes of Cornwall, without
any creation, and are at age to sue their livery, how young soever. Whom with
their predecessors we shall marshall thus, Dukes, and Earls of Cornwall.

COVENTRY.
COventry is a fair and goodly City, within the limits of Warw^ck shire, but
now within the County of Warwi^k; heretofore called so from the Convent, by
which and the translating of the Sea Epi^copal^ from Lichf^ild hither, it grew
exceeding rich and wealthy. And though it now has neither Convent, nor
Episcopal See (more than in ruin and in title) it still continues its old
wealth; being the best City of mart and trade in all these parts; commodiously
built and seated, and more than ordinarily frequented for an Inland Town. It
belonged once unto the ^arles of Chester, and afterward by many mean
conveyances to John of Eltham Earl of Cornwall; and so this place became
annexed unto that Earldome. Nor lost it any thing, but rather gained much by
that annexation: Henry the 6. laying unto it certain the adjacent Villages:
and making it with them a County corporate, clearly distinct from that of
Warwick. It is now one of the honourary titles of the Duke of Buckingham,
George Marquess of Buckingham, being created Duke of Bukingham, and Earl of
Coven^y, by letters patents bearing date in May, 21 Iac. and for the remnant of
his life he, and since him, his son enjoyed both the title of Dukes of
Buckingham, and Earls of Coventry.

Duke of Buckingham, and Earl of Coventry, 1641.

CVMBERLAND.
CVmberland is the furthest Country of England, on the Northwest side,
anciently part of the Brigantes. It is called Cumbria in the Latin, and
Cumbrorum ^erra* as being inhabited by the true and natural Britans, (who in
their own language are called Kymri) when as the residue of these Northern parts
had yielded to the conquering Saxon. A Country, for the situation of it,
neither unpleasant nor unprofitable; the Valleis yielding corn sufficiently,
the Mountains breeding great flocks of sheep, the Meeres replenished with all
kind of wild foul, and the adjoining Sea affording a variety of excellent
fish. It contains in it not above 58 Parish Churches, but very many Chapels
of Ease, as big and large as any Parish. Of these there are 9 Market Towns,
whereof the chief (next Carlisle) for dispatch of business, is that of Perith,
wherein they hold their Sessions and Assizes. Late was it ere this County
became an Earldome: viz. when as K. H. the 8. bestowed the style and dignity of
Earl of Cumberland, upon Henry Lord Clyfford, whose issue still continue
Earls of Cumberland.

DANBY.
DAnby is an ancient Castle in the hundred or Wapontake of Cleveland, in the
Northriding of Yorkshire, seated near to a large Park, and a goodly chase of
the same name. It belonged anciently unto the L. Latimer, and was sold with
other lands belonging to that Family unto Ralph Nevill Earl of Westmerland,
who forth with gave the same to his son Sir George Nevil, whom K. H. the 6. not
long after summoned to the Parliament by the name of Lord Latimer. His issue
male failing in Qu Elizabeth's times, and the Estate being divided between his
two daughters and coheires, this Castle with the lands adjoining fell unto the
share of his daughter Mary, who being married to Sir John Danvers of Wil^sh.
was by him mother of S Hen. Danvers, created by K. James L. Danvers of
Dan^eser, and by our Sovereigne now being the first E of Danby. 1629 1 Henry L.
Danvers of Dantesey, cr. E. of Danby, Feb. 7. 10 Car. now living, Anno 1641.

DARBY.
DArbyshire is a part of the Coritani, and took that name of Darby, the chief
town thereof. A Town conveniently seated on the River of Derwent, beautified
with five Parish Churches, a goodly stone Bridge, and a large Marketplace: and
no less famous for Good Ale, than Banbury for Cakes and Che^se. Finally, the
Town is well traded, and of good resort; and is the usual place of holding
Sessions and Assisses for all the County. The Country of the East and South
parts well manured and fruitful; yielding a very spacious and pleasing
prospect, both out of Tutbury Castle, and that of Boulsover. The West part*
which they call the Peak, is not so pleasing to the eye, though possible as
profitable to the purse; being rich in iron, lead, and coals, which it yields
abundantly; and grazing multitudes of sheep on the Mountain tops. It contains
in it 106 Parish Churches, of the which 8 be Market^towns; the chief thereof
being Darby, as before is said: the Catalogue of whose Earls now follows.

DENBIGH.
Denbigh-shire is one of the shires of Northwales, heretofore appertaining to
the Ordevices. The Country very mounteinous, and as barren generally; though
by the pains and industry of the husbandman, it be made in some parts very
fruitful. The chief town Denbigh is well seated on the banks of the river
Istrad, which from thence runs into the Cluyd, the fairest river of this
country. A town well peopled and inhabited, especially since it became the
head of the county; which was not till the 27 of Hen. the 8. what time the five
new shires were added to the rest in Wales, of which this was one. But before
that it was the head town of the Barony of Denbigh, being conceived to be one
of the goodliest territories in all England, as having more Gentlemen holding
thereof in fee, and by service, than any other. Lords it has had good store,
and of several Families; but none of them a Parliamentary Peer (in reference
hereunto) till these later times. Of late it has given title both of Lord and
Earl to two several Families; viz. to these Lords and Earls of Denbigh.

DEVONSHIRE.
DEvonshire is the most Western Country of all England, excepting Cornwall,
together with the which it made up the possession of the old Danmon i. It is
called Devi^an by the Cornish Britans, that is, the country of Low-valleies,
because the people dwell for the most part beneath in vales. From thence the
Saxons had their Devenshire; and the Latin^s borrow their Devonia A country
harborous on either side with commodious Havens, enriched with inexhaustable
mines of tin, beautified with fresh and pleasant meadows, shaded again in
other parts with greater store of woods, and very well replenished with Towns
and Villages; whereof it reckons in the whole 394 Parishes, and therein 37
Market towns of good note and trade. The country of it self not so fit for
corn, but that the toil and travail of the plou^^^an supplies that defect,
and adds unto it both by cost and industry what it wants by Nature. Earls it
has had of several Families; of which the Rivers and the Courtneys held the
title long: as now the Cavendishes may do, who have possession of it in the
third generation. But how long any of them held it, and who they were that
interloped, we shall best see, by looking over the particular Names and
Families of the Earls of Devonshire.

DORSET.
THe County of Dorset, abbutteth upon that of Devonshire, having the Sea up on
the South, and Somersetshire upon the North. It was inhabited hertofore by the
Durotriges, and was all the land they did inhabit. The air good, and of an
healthful constitution; the soil fat and rich in many places, and where in
that it is defective; it yelds good store of woods and pasture. The Country
generally very pleasant in her situation, as being no less beholding to the
inner land Rivers, than the bordering Ocean; the one yielding merchandise from
far, the other the commodity of conveyance to most parts thereof; and both of
them good store of fish. It conteines in it 248 Parishes, and in them 18
Market-Townes, the chief of which in name is Dorcester, as that which does
denominate the whole Country, and took that name it self from the Durotriges,
whom before I spoke of; unless you rather think that it comes from Dur^ium,
which Ptolomy places in this tract. A Town not famous for much else, than that
it has long been, and does still continue the honorary title of these Noble
personages, which have been severally Marquesses and Earls of Dorset.

the Queen 1641.

DOVER.
DOver, is a well known and famous Town, both for the Haven and the Castle,
for the security and renown of which and the convenient si^uation of it over
against France; it has long been accounted one of the Cinque Ports. Seated it
is in the very South-East point of Kent, from whence a man may easily discern
the coast of F^ance as being but 34 miles distant. The ^own stands in the
bottom between the clyffes, very warm and safe; the Castle mounted up aloft,
both to command and to defend it A place indeed of such impregnable strength,
and so great importance, that Philip King of France, when L^wys his son being
called in hither by the factious Barons against their Sovereign L. King John,
had gotten many Towns and Forts, but yet could not get the mastery of this
piece, despised all, saying, verily my son has not one foot of land in
England, if he be not master of Dover Castle. It now gives title of an Earl to
1627 3 Henry Carry, Visc. Rochfort, created E of Dover 3 Car. Mart. 8, and is
now living, 1641.

ESSEX.
ESsex was anciently perteining to the East- Saxons, and made a chief part of
their Kingdom; hence it took the name. Before it did belong to the
Tr^nobantes. A Country large in compass, fruitful of corn and other sorts
of grain, plentiful in saffron well wooded and well watered also; and that not
only by the Sea, and the River of Thams, which washes all one side thereof,
but with fair, and fresh, and fishful Rivers, which do afford no small
commodity unto it. The greatest want it has is of sweet fresh air; those
parts thereof which lie along upon the Thames, (which they call the hundreds)
being very aguish and unhealthy. This County contains in it 415 Parish
Churches, whereof 21 are Market Towns, of which Colchester is far the
richest, fairest and best traded. Yet in regard it stands in the extremity of
all the Country, the Sessions and Assisses are held most commonly at
Chelmesford, which is almost in the middle of it. But it is time to leave the
Country, and come unto The Earls of Essex.

EXETER.
EXeter is now the chief City of Devonshire as heretofore of the Danmonii, by
Ptolomy called Isca, and so by Antonine, but that the Copies are mistaken, in
which, instead of Isca Danmoniorum, we read Isca Dunmoriorum. A fair and
goodly Town it is, seated upon the Eastern bank of the river Ex, from whence
it had the name of Excester. In circuit it conteines within the walls about a
mile and a half, besides the suburbs which every way stretch out to a great
length; and in that circuit there are numbered 15 Parish Churches, besides the
Cathedral. The whole enviro^ed with deep ditches, and very strong walls having
many towrs therein very well disposed, and yet the animosity of the inhabitants
is a greater strength unto it, than the walls or ditch^s; whereof they have
given notable proof, in these later times. But for that I refer you to the
common Chronicles; and now present you with the Dukes, Marq. and Earls of
Exeter.

FLINT.
F^intshire, is one of the old shires of Northwales, and though augmented
somewhat by K. H. the 8. what time the March-ground was appropriated unto
several shires (for which see 37. H. c. 26.) Yet it is still the lest of all,
as not containing above 2^ Parishes, and of them only one market town. The
Country not so mounteinous as the rest of Wales; exceedingly well furnished
both with corn for men, and grass for cattle; of which it has good store
for number, though for bulk but little. It took denomination from the Castle
of Flint, begun by H. 2, but finished by K. Edw 1, for a goodfence against the
Welsh. This Country has been always held to be an appendant on that of
Chester, and does ad gladium Cestriae pertinere, as the old books ^ay: but both
united now unto the principality of Wales. Edward of Windsore eldest son of K.
Edw. 2 was summoned by his father to the Parliament by the name of E. of
Chester, and Flint; since which it has continued as a title in the Princes of
Wales; and there you shall be sure to find who were Earls of Flint.

GLOUCESTER.
GLocester^shire, anciently was part of the possessions of the Dobuni. A
fruitful and a pleasant Country, being honored with a full course of the
river of Severne, and the original or fountain of the River of Thames. That
part thereof which is beyond the Se^erne is overspread with woods; all which
included in one name, make the Forest of Deane. That part that butteth upon
Oxfordshire, is swelled up with hills, called the Cotswold hills; but these even
covered, as it were with sheep, which yields a wool of notable finenes^e,
hardly inferior to the best of England. Between those two is seated a most
fruitful Vale, fruitful to admiration, of all kinds of grain, and
heretofore of Vine^ and Vineyards; the want of which is now supplied by a drink
made of Apples, called Syder, which here they make in great abundance. In this
so fruitful Vale stands the City of Gloucester, denominating all the Country;
and taking name from the old Glevum, herein placed by Antonine; for Gleaucester
the Saxons styled it. A fine and neat city I assure you it is, daintily seated
on the Severne; with a large Keye or wharse on the banks thereof, very
commodious to the Merchandise and trade of the place* The streets are generally
fair, and the town well built. And which adds no small luster to it, Richard
the 3, once Duke hereof, by laying unto it two of the adjacent hundreds made it
a County of it self; calling it the County of the City of Gloucester. A City
finally it is, as worthy to denominate so rich a Country, as is the Country
to give title to those eminent persons, that in their several times and ages,
have been the Dukes and Earls of Gloucester.

HARTFORD.
HArtford-shire is another of those Countries, which formerly were inhabited by
the Cattreuch^ani. A Country, as it is described by Camden, rich in corn
fields pastures, meadows, woods, groves, and clear riverets; and which for
ancient Towns may compare with any of its neighbors; there being no one shire
in England, that can show more places of antiquity, in so small a compass. It
conteines in it but 120 Parishes, and of them 18 are market Towns. The
Shire-towne, which does also give denomination unto all the Country is
Hertford, seated on the bank of the river Lea, by Beda called Herudford, which
some interpret the Red ford, and others some the Ford of herts. A Town not
much frequented, nor greatly inhabited, as overtopped by Ware, which enjoys
the throughfare; and by S. Albans, which enjoys the trade of all the
Country. The greatest commendation of it is in the antiquity; and that it has
been longest ^ title of honor, of any other in this Country: the Family of the
Clares and Seymours having been long enobled with the style of Earls of
Hartford.

HEREFORD.
HEreford-shire, was in times past inhabited by the Silures. A Country, which
besides that it is right pleasant, is for yielding of corn, and feeding of
cattle, in all places most fruitful, and therewith passing well furnished
with all things necessary for man's life; insomuch that it would scorn to come
hehind any one County in England, the people using it for a byword, that for
three W.W.W. that is, Wheat, Wool, and Water, it yields to no shire in all
the Kingdom. The name is takes from Hereford, the chief Town thereof, which
rose out of the ruins of old Ariconium, here placed by Antonine; the tract and
footsteps of which name, it does still retain. The Town is seated very
pleasantly upon the banks of the River Wye, in the middle of most flourishing
Meadows, and no less plentiful corn fields: and for defense thereof, had
once a strong and stately Castle, which now time has ruined. The Normans
became masters of the place, as soon almost as they had made their entrance
into England, and unto them the Castle owes its original; and 2 years after
the said Conquest, it was made an Earldom, and has since given the title of
Dukes, Earls, and Viscounts.

HOLDERNESSE.
HOldernesse is the name of a large Promontory or head-land, in the East Riding
of Yorkshire, lying on the South-east of the river of Hull: P^olomy seems to
call it Ocellum, a certain Monk Cavam Deiram, or the Hollow Country of the
Dei^ians; expressing in those words the new name of Holdernesse. William the
Conqueror gave this territory to Stephen the son of Od^ of Champaig^e Lord of
Aumerie, in Normandy; whose issue did continue Lords hereof, whiles any issue
of that house continued. But that line being extinct in Aveline, first wife of
Edmund Earl of Lancaster, the Earldome of Aub^rmarle, and the honor of
Holdernesse were seized into the Kings hands, for default of heirs. It has
lien dormant since, till these later days; in which K. James* bestowed this
title, on 1620 1 John Ramsey, Visc. Hadi^gton in Scotland, cr. E. of
Holdernesse and Bar. of Kingston upon Thames, 18 Iac. Dec. 30. Mort sans issue.

HOLLAND.
HOlland is one of the 3 parts of Lincol^sh* situate on the South-West co^ner
of it, in the fennes and marshes. The ground surrounded much with waters,
heretofore yielded very small store of grain, but great plenty of grass, and
plentifully furnished ^oth with fish and foul. But now upon the dreyning of
this fenny Country, they begi^ to plough it, and sow the same (...) ploughed
with rape-seed, which yields a very great increase, and is become a rich
^ommo^ity. The Town of most antiq^ity is Crowland, heretofore famous for the
Abbey, valued at the supression at 1217 l. 5 s. 11 d. per Annum. That of most
trade and note is Boston; a fine Town indeed, and very famous for the lan^erne,
which is a very excellent sea-mark, and a landmark too. And this with all, is
to be noted of this Country, that howsoever one can hardly ^^nd a stone in it
(such is the softness of the soil) yet you shall no where find more
beautyfull Churches, all built of square and polished stone. It now gives
title of an E. to 1624 1 Hen. Rich* L. Ke^sington, cr. E. of Holland, 22 Iac.
Apr. 3, now living and Chan. of Came. 1641.

HVNTINGDON.
HVntingdon-shire was heretofore inhabited by the Iceni. A Country generally
good for corn and tillage; and toward the East, where it adjoyneth on the
fennes, as rich in pasturage: elsewhere it is as pleasant, though not so
profitable, by reason of the rising hills, and fine shady groves. It has been
heretofore well beset with Woods, and was indeed a Forest till the time of King
Henry the second, in the beginning of whose reign, disforested. In this
regard, the Forest yielding special opportunity, and delight for Hunters, the
chief Town of it had the name of Hunter down, we now call it Huntingod^, with
very little variation. The Town commodiously seated upon the northern bank of
the River Ouse, rising unto the No^th on the ascent of an hill: adorned with
four parish Churches, and had a little A^bey once, founded by Maud the Emper.
and Eustace Lovelos^: the ruins of the which, and of a far^e more ancient
Castle, built by King Edward the older, Anno 917* are yet to be seen. This
County con^^ineth in it five other market Towns, besides the shire-Towne, and
79 Parishes in the whole: and did become an Earldome presently on the Norman
Conquest, as it has ever since continued in these Earls of Huntingdon.

KENDALL.
KEndall, is the name of a Town in Westm^rland, called also Cand^le, and Kirk
by Candals, as being seated in a dale near the river Can. The Town built in
the manner of a Cross, two long and broad streets crossing one another; a Town
of great resort and trade, especially for woollen clothes, which they make
there in great abundance, and thence vent through all parts of England. This
Town has been an ancient Barony, descending from the Talboyses, to the Breoses
or Bruces; by them unto the Rosses of Wark, some of whose line a^tained the
title of ^. Rosse of Kendal, so to distinguish them from the Lord Roos of
Hamlake; and so at last unto the Parres, to one of which it gave the title of
Baron of Kendall, as it has done before of E. to others, of more note and
eminency; which are these that follow, 1 John D. of Bedford, 3 son unot K. H.
4, Regent of France, and E. of Kendall. 2 John D. of ^omerset, E. of Kend. 1446
3 John de Foix, cr. E. of Kend. by K. H. 6, since which, those of that Family
do write themselves ^^rles of Longueville and Kendall. 1539 4 William Parre
Knight, created Lord Parre of Kendall, 30 Henry the 8. March 9 (created after
Earl of Ex. by King Henry the 8. and Marques^e of Northampton by King Edward
the 6 the rights and interests of which house are now devolved unto the
He^berts, Earls of Pem^roke, descending from the Lady Anne, sister and heir
of the said Lord Parre.

KENT.
KEnt, in Latin Ca^^um, so called as being seated in the Canton or Corner of
the kingdom, is a very rich and pleasant Country, lying between the T^ames
and the narrow Seas. A Country very good for corn, and fit for pasturage,
according to the several plots and parts thereof; and wondrous full of
fruitful and well-ordered Orchards, from whence the City of London is supplied
with most sort of fruit. The Villages and Towns stand exceeding thick, being in
all 398 Parishes, besid^s lesser Hamlets, which make up the two Diocesses of
Canterbury and Rochester. It has also diverse safe Roades, and sure Harbors
for ships; and those exceeding well defended with Forts and Castles. Caesar,
when he arrived in k^nt, found here 4 kings* (for so they called the Chiefes of
the principal Families) and gives this testimony of the people, that they were
the most courteous, and civil of all the Britan^. In the declining of whose
Empire, Vor^iger gave this Country unto the Saxons, who being Heathens, when
the rest of the I^^e were Christians, gave an occasion to the Proverb of Kent
and Christ^ndome. At that time it was made a Kingdom; as in the entrance of
the Normans it was made an Earldom, and so it has continued in the persons of
these Earls of Kent.

KINGSTON.
KIngston, is the name of a well known and eminent Town in the East Riding of
Yorkshire, which standing on the mouth of the river Hull, where it does fall
into the Humber, is better known amongst us by the name of Hull. A town indeed
of no antiquity, being first built by Edward the ^, who liking the situation of
the place, compounded for it with the Abbot of Meaux, (to whom it formerly
belonged) and there built the town, and caused it to be called Kingston. It
rose up in a little time to great reputation; so that for fair and sumptuous
buildi^gs, strong blockhouses, well furnished ships and wealth of trade, it is
become the most remarkable town for merchandise in these parts of Eng. Michael
de la Pole, the first E. of Suffolk of that Family, being son of Will. d^ la
Pole, a rich merchant here* obtained great privileges for the place, which his
successors as they grew in favor, did i^crease and multiply: and in the days
of H. 6 ^il. E. Marq. and D of Suffolk, procured it to be made a County
incorporate, as our Lawyers phrase it. Of late days of a County it became the
Earldome, of 1628 1 Rob. Pierrepont, Visc. Newark, cr. E. of Kingston upon
Hull, 4. Car. July 25, who is now living, Ann^ 1641.

LANCASTER.
LAncashi^e, or the County Palatine of Lancaster, was heretofore a part of the
Brigants; and lies upon the Irish ^ea* to the North of Ch^shire. The ground
accounted not so fert^le as in other places, fitter for oats and such lean
corn, than wheat or barley. And yet it is observed with all, that in t^ose
parts thereof, in which the husbandman is not wanting to it, in cost and
labor, that there it yeldeth corn in a very good measure. The air ther^of
may seem to be very healthful; and one would easily co^jecture so by the
complexion of the people, which ar^ fair and beautiful. And yet the Country
is not much inhabited, as in the n^ighbouring shires* about them: there being
in so large a quantity of ground, as this shire con^aines, not above 36*
Parishes though indeed many Chappel^ of Ease, equal to P^rishes elsewhere for
multitudes of people. It takes name from the Town of Lancas^e^, or more truly
L^ncaster, seated upon the banks of the river L^nc, whence it had the name; the
Saxons adding Ceaster (as in other places) for the ^ermination. The Town not
very well peopled, nor much frequented; and yet of that authority and credit,
that it gives name to all the County, and has obtained this privilege from K.
Edw. the 3, that the Sessions and Assizes should be held in no other place.
What Lords and Governors it had in the former times, we regard not here. The
first time it became an Earldome, was when K. H. 3, conferred that title on his
2 son Edm. and it was destin^te to greatness in the first foundation; there
being laid unto it at the very first, besides this County, the whole
con^iscated estates of the E^rles of Leices^er and Darby, and the B^rony of
Monmouth. And into this by marriages accrewed in time, the great estates of
Will. de Fortibus, E. of A^merl^ and Lord of Holdernesse, (...), and other
goodly lands in Frances; the Earldome of Lincoln, and good part of that of
Salisbury, the Lorships of Ogmore and Kidwelly in Wales, which were once the
Chaworths. John of Ga^nt a d^d hereunto the Castles and Honors of Hertford,
and Thickhill, and his son B^lling broke a moyetie of the lands of ^ohun* being
^ of Here^ord, Essex, and Northampton: so that it was the greatest patrimony
(as I verily think) of any subject Prince in Christendom. Lancaster finally
was made a County Palatine by K* Edward the 3, and has been hounoured with
the^e Dukes and Earls of Lancaster.

whom this County Palatine, and all the lands and honors belonging and
incorporate into the Duchy of Lancaster, were brought unto the Crown of Eng.
though governed as an Estate apart, then by its proper Officers, as it
continued til the time of K. Edw. the 4, who did appropriate it to the Crown,
and dissolved the former government thereof, to which it was restored again by
K. H. 7, and so still remains under the guidance of the Chancellor, and other
Officers of the same.

LEICESTER.
Leichestershire is a part of the Coritani, and ^ooke that name from Leicester
the chief town thereof; a town indifferent large, and of a reasonable handsome
building, and as wel^raded as most inland towns that want (as this) the benefit
of a navigable river. It had once a very fair Collegiate Church within it, and
a fair Abbey close unto (...), and a strong Castle therewithal; but all these
the iniquity and inju^y ^f time has ruined. Only the Hospital, of all the
ancient edifices; stands still undefaced. As for the Country hence
denominated, it bears corn good pl^nty, but is bare of woods; the want of
which is well supplied with pit-coale, with which the North part of the Country
does store all the rest. It co^^eineth in the whole 200 Parishes, and of them 12
are market Towns; the biggest, as in bulk being Leicester, so in title too; as
that which has been honored even before the ^onquest, with the style and
reputation of an Earldome; and has continued it till now in the names and
families of these Earls of Leicester.

LINCOLN.
Lincolnshire anciently belonged to the Core^ani. A very large and spacious
Country, extending almost 60 miles in length, and some 30 in breadth; within
which compass are included 630* Parish Churches, and of them 30 market Towns.
It is accounted very kindly ground for the yield of corn, and feeding of
cattle, and furnished in the lower part thereof with good store of foul,
which from hence are conveied to London in great abundance. It takes name from
the principal City, by Ptolomy and Antonin^, called Lindum; and after by the
Saxons Lind^colline, either because it stands on so high an hill (from the
Latin Collis) or that it had been formerly some Roman Colony. A Town of great
renown and strength in the times of the Britans, and in the Normans time (as
says William of Malmesbury) it was one of the best peopled Cities of England;
a place of merchandise and traffic for all comers, both by sea and land;
insomuch that (...) then Bishop of Dorc^s^er, thought fitting to translate
hither his Episcopal see. From this opinion it then had, first began the
Proverb, that Lincoln was, London is, etc. The Bishops of Lincoln what and how
they were, we have seen already. We will now look a while on the Ea^les of
Lincoln.

LINDSEY.
LIndsey is one of the 3 parts of Lincolnshire, (the other 2 being Holland,
which we spoke of lately, and Kesteven, not yet become an honourary title, as
the others are. It contains all the Northern parts thereof, from the river
Witham unto Humber, and from the Ocean to the Trent. Happy above the rest, not
in bigness only; but that in this part stands the City of Lincoln, the chief
denominator of the County, which being the antienly called Lindum (as before I
said) gave to this part the name of Lindsey, for by that name of Lindsey, it is
now the Earldome of 1626 1 Robert Bertu, Lord Willoughby of Eresby, and Lord
great Chamberlain of England, created E. of Lindsey, 2 Car. November. 29, now
living, 1641,

MANCHESTER.
MAnchester is a good Town of Lancashire, situate on the hithermost part
thereof, where it joyneth to the County of Darby. A Town of very great
antiquity, known to the Emperor Antonine, by the name of Manc^nium; part of
which name it still retains. And still it carries a good account, and far
excels the Towns lying round about it, both for the beautiful show it
carries, and the resort unto it of the neighboring people, and which allures
them thither, the great trade of Clothing, Manchester Co^tons being famous in
all drapers shops. It is remarkable also in those parts for the large Market
place, for a fair Church, and for the College: which last being founded first
by the Lord De la Ware, was afterward refounded or confirmed by Qu. Eliz.
consisting fo a Warden and certain fellows, which notwithstanding, it is yet
more famous, in being made the honorary title of 1625 1 Henry Montague, Vise.
Mandevi cr. E. of Manch. ^ Car. F^^. 7, b^ing then L President of the Council,
now L. Privy Seal, Anno 1641.

MARCH.
March is a name of different nature, from the rest before, as being neither
Town nor County. Under that name of March or of Marches rather, our Ancestors
did comprehend those ba^able grounds between Wales and Eng. for governance
whereof, and the repressing of the insolences of either side, there were
certain Lords and Potent men, whose lands lay nearest to these parts, which
were called Lords Marchers, who had great power and jurisdiction in their
several quarters. Amongst these were the Mortimers of Wigmore, men of great
authority, who after were advanced above the rest, and made Earls of March.
And it continued in that Family, until it fell by marriage to the house of
York; and so by Edw. the 4, to the Crown of Eng. Nor was it long before the
authority of the Lords Marchers was extinguished quite, by the uniting of Wales
to E^. and either making new shires of the said March ground, (such as are
Monmouth, Brecknoch, Radnor, Denbigh and Montgomcry) or laying it unto the old,
for which consult the Act of Parliament 27 H. 8. cap. 26. However the title of
E. of March is revived again; only translated from the house of Mortimer, to
that of Stewart; out of which houses have been successively, these Earls of
March.

MARLEBVRGH.
MArleburgh is a Town in the North-east part of Wilt-shire, seated not far off
from the head of the river Kenet: which runs thence to Hung^rford, and
Newbury, and so by Reading into the Thames. The Town called anciently Cunetio
in Antonino's Itinerarium, as the river was: but by the Normans, in whose time
this Town revived (out of the ruins of the old) it was called Marleburgh, as
being seated in a chaulky soil, which in some places still we call by the name
of Marle. A Town stretched out from East to West, upon the pendant of an hill,
and had a Castle once belonging unto John, surnamed Sans t^rre, who afterward
was K. of England which is still famous in our Law books, for a Parliament
there held, 52. H. 3, in which were made the ^tatutes (from hence called) of
Marleburgh, right necessary for the peace and tranquillity of the people, as is
affirmed in the preamble unto the same. Our Sovereign at his Coronation made
it yet more notable, in making it the honor, as it was the neighbor of 1625 1
James L. Ley, L. Tr. cr. E. of Marleburgh, 1 Car. Feb 7. 1628 2 Henry Ley. 3
James Ley, now E. of Marleburgh, Anno 1641.

MARSHALL.
THe title of E. Ma^shall is different from the rest of England, all of the
which (the title of Earl Rivers excepted only) are local, or denominated from
some place; this only personal: the residue being only honorary, this honorary
and officiary, both together. Anciently they that had this office were only
Marshals of the Kings house, according as the same is now discharged by the
Knights Marshall. But in succeeding times it grew to be a place of great power,
and honor; as it still continues. At first they had the title of L. Marshall
only. Rich. the 2 was the first, who by letters Pa^ents advanced them to the
dignity of Earls Marshals, and with all gave them power to bear a staf^e of
gold, enammeled black at both ends, with the Kings Arms on the upper end, and
their own Arms on the lower; whereas before that time, the Marsh^ls; had no
other than a wooden staff, as other the Great Officers have at Court. Before
this time, they were L. Ma^shals only, as before I said. For howsoever the
title of E. Marshall and Comes Marescallus, does many times occur in our
ancient histories. Yet I conceive that it was only given them then by the
cour^esie or curiality of England, because the Office in those days was vested
in the person of none but Earls; as by the like mistake or courtesy, we find
the title of Comes Seneschallus, and Comes Constabularius in some old Records.
the manor of Hamsted Marshall in the County of Berkshire, was held of old by
Grand Sergianty of the Kings of England; conditioned that the Grantees should
for ever be the K. Marshals, according as the Offices of Steward, Constable,
and Lord High Chamberlain, in those times were granted. What the authority and
jurisdiction is of this great Officer, we regard not here, it being our
undertaking only to lay down the names of those (as many at lest as I have met
with in my reading) which in their several times have borne the title of Lords
and Earls Marshall.

Kent and D. of Surrey, was made E. Marsh, upon the banishment of the D. of
Norfolk. 1399 22 Tho. L. M^wb* E. of Noting. did on his fathers death (at
Venice) assume the title of E* Marsh. but the office was exercised by 23 Ralp.

Commission. 1621 38 Thomas Howard, Earl of Arundell and Surrey, (grand son of
Thomas, Duke of Norfolk, by his son Philip Earl of Arundell) was by King James
created Earl Marshall, as he still continues, Anno 1641.

MIDDLESEX.
MIddlesex is a part of the Trinobantes, lying upon the banks of the river
T^ames. A Coun^y not so large as others, but far more remarkable, for sumptuous
houses, wel-built villages, a fertile soil, and temperate air; and which
adds most unto it, for the great Cities of London and Westminster, which are
seated in it, and for the constant residence of the Court, the Receptacle and
aboade of the Kings of Eng. who have made this County happy above others with
their Royal mansions. Whitehall, and Hampton Court, Somerset house and S.
James, still in the possession of the Crown; Enfeild, and Hanworth, aliened
now, have either been the chief aboades, or retiring places of our Kings and
Princes. In which regard, the Kings of Eng. anciently (as Camden notes it)
vouchsafed the title of Middlesex unto none, neither D. Marq. E. nor B.
although, I know not by what popular error, the Citizens of London reckoned the
L. Major elect, for E. of Middlesex. Which whatsoever ground it had, has none
now to stand on, that title being not long since bestowed on 1622 1 Lionel L.
Cranfeild. L. Tr. of Eng. cr. E. of Middlesex, 20 Iac. Sep. 17. and now alive,
Anno 1641.

MONMOUTH.
MOnmouth-shire is the nearest shire of Wales, though it desires rather to be
accounted a part of England, and is indeed included in the circuit of the
English Judges. It lies upon the North of the river Sev^n, there where it
grows into a Sea; the East parts full of grass and woods, the West somewhat
hilly, and stony withal; yet not unprofitable to the husbandman, if he be not
wanting to himself. It takes name from the chief Town Monmouth, and that from
being seated on the mouth of the River Mu^ow, there where it shootes into the
Wye. It was the Barony once of John L. of Monmouth, on whose attaindure it was
settled in the house of Lancas^er; from whom it after did receive great
privileges and immunities, which they still enjoy. Henry the fifth, son unto
King Henry the fourth (the first of the Lancastrian Family) was in this place
borne, (which shows that noble Family so highly prized it, to make it their
dwelling) and was from hence called Henry of Monmouth. That one particular
enough, to renown the place; and therefore we shall add no more. It is
b^longing still to the house of Lancaster, as to the possession, being
dependant on the Duchy; and not much aliened from it as unto the title: the
Caries, which derive themselves from Lancaster, by the line of Somerset, being
now honored with the title of Earls of Monmouth.
1625 1 Robert Lord Carry of Leppington, created E. of Monmouth, ^ Car* Feb. 7.
1639 2 Robert Carry now Earl of Monmouth, now living, Anno 1641,

MONTACVTE.
MOntacute is the name of a very ancient and illustrious Family, so called from
Montacute, a sharp ^ill in the South parts of Somerset^ shire, between Evil
and Martok. The place called Biscopeston by the Saxons, but by the E. of
Moriton brother by the mothers side to William the Conqueror (who built a
Castle on the top of it) it was called Montacute. It afterward gave name to
that noble Family (as before I said) who being Lords hereof came after to be
Earls of Salisbury* and since in other Families (but descending from them)
has been the honorary style and appellation of these Marq. Lords and Visc.
Montacute.

MONTGOMERY.
MOntgomery-shire is one of the new shires of Wales, taken out of the
March-grounds by K. H. 8. Anno 27; of his reign, so called from the Town and
Castle of Montgomery, and that from Roger de Montgomery a noble Norman, Earl
of Shrewsbury, who winning much ^and herabouts from the Welsh, first built it
to secure his Conqu. It stands not for from the banks of the river Severne,
upon the rising of a rock; from whence it has a very free prospect into a
pleasant plain that lies beneath it. The Family of the Herberts is very much
diffused, and of great authority in this Country* out of which Family 1605
Philip Herbert 2 son of Hen. Earl of Pembrok, was cr E. of Montgomery 3 Iac.
May 4, and is now also E. of Pembrok and L. Cham. An. 1641.

MOVLGRAVE.
MOulgrave is an ancient Castle in the north riding of Yorkshire, situate
near unto the sea, and not far from Whitbay. First built it was by Peter de
Mouley, (or de malo lacu, in the Latin) in the time of Rich. 1, and being in
his eye, a very beautiful pile, was by him called Moult-Grace, but being a
grievous yoke to the neighbor inhabitants, was by them called Moult-grave, by
which name, and no other, now the world takes notice of it. It continued in his
line for seven generations, and all of them called Peter's too: and then the
issue male failing, it passed through several Families by the heirs general,
and now belong^th to the Sheffeilds; out of which house 1625 1 Edm. L.
Sheffeild L. President of the North, was cr. E. of Moulgrave, 1 Car. Feb. 7,
and is still alive, Anno 1641.

NEWCASTLE.
New Castle is the hithermost town of all Northumberland, and the chief of the
North; seated upon the further bank of the river Tine, which is there so deep,
and well fenced withal, that it gives a very safe station to the tallest
ships. It stands on the declining of a very steep hill, adorned with 4
Churches, fortified with strong walls, and beautified with goodly buildings. A
town of very great resort, especially by reason of the trade of Sea cole, which
is conveyed hence to all parts of the Kingdom, and many other parts of
Christendom. It rose out of the ruins of old Gabrosentum: and had this new
name from a Castle built by Robert son of Will. the Conq. And thriving by the
benefit and intercourse of trade, became at length of such reputation, that by
K. H. 6. it was made a County incorporate, as we use to say; and finally
thought worthy to give the honor of an E to 1623 1 Ludowick D. of Lennox and
E. of Richmond, cr. E. of Newcastle, 2 Iac. in May. 1627 2 Will. Cavendish,
Visc. Mansfield, cr E* of Newcastle, 3 Car Mar. 7. Now Gover. and Gent. of the
Bedchamber of the Prince his high. A. 1641,

NEWPORT.
NEwport is the chief Town of the Isle of Wight, called in times past Medena,
afterward Novus burgus de Meden, and by us now, Newport. A Town well seated
and much frequented, and withal populous in it self; which most arises from
the benefit of a little haven capable of vessels of the smaller burden, which
com^ up to the very key. For government within, it has a Major and Burgesses,
being made a Corporation by K. Ia^es, and for a further luster to it, in the
world abroad, it pleased our Sovereign L. K. Charles, to create 162^ Montjoy
Blount, Lord Montjoy, E. of Newport, 3 Car. Aug. 3, who is now Master of the
Ordnance, and of the Counsel for war, Ann^ 1641.

NORFOLK.
NOrfolk is the greatest County of Eng. next to Yorksh. but far (...) populous
than that; as comprehending in the whole 660 Parish Churches, of which 27 are
market towns. It anciently was a part of the Iceni, and next the Northern part
of the Kingdom of the East Angles, from whence it had the name of Northfolk,
as has the Southern people of it, the name of Southfolk. The soil according
to the variety of places is of different nature; in some fat, rank, and full of
moisture; in others very light and sandy: yet so that one contributing unto the
other, and the sea giving help to both, it is very plentiful country for
corn, sheep, and fish. The people notably industrious both for plough and
manufactures; insomuch that one shall hardly see a beggar throughout all the
Country: And yet (which makes the merveile much the greater) they are notable
wranglers, well versed and studied in the quirks of Law, and consequently
create more work for the Assizes, than almost all the circuit else. But then it
is observed withal, that this disposition has brought some reputation with
it, as furnishing the Courts of Ius^ice with many an eminent man in the laws of
Eng. and yielding generally the best breed of Lawyers. It is observed, by a
great antiquary of this Kingd. that in this County are ^oo Families of ancient
Gentry, which never were attainted of high treason, which if it be true, the
Gentry of Norfolk have had better fortune than the Dukes and Earls.

NORTHAMPTON.
THe County of Northampton, is situate almost in the very mid^le and heart of
Eng. A Champion Country for the most part, exceeding populous, and ^o
replenished with Towns and Churches, (being in all 326, whereof 10 are
markets) that in some places there are 20 or 30 steeples to be seen at once.
The soil exceeding fertile both for tillage and pasture, maintaining numerous
flocks of sheep, and herds of cattle; but somewhat destitute of woods. It
takes name from North^^pton, the chief town thereof, seated upon the river
Nen; which anciently called A^fona, but corruptly Antona, bestowed this name
upon the town, being indeed built on the Northern bank. A town which for the
beauty and circuit of it, may be well ranked with many Cities of the Kingdom:
and heretofore so safe and sure by reason of the strong walls, (from whence
there is a goodly prospect into all the County) and a strong Castle, now
demolished; that once the students of Cambridge had a purpose to remove their
University unto it. This strength however made it obnoxious to some
disadvantage, as being a place much aimed at in our Civil wars, and many a
battle fought about it, Yet never were the times so turbulent* or the place
so dangerous, but that there were some persons of superior rank, who did
affect the name, and enjoy the title of Earls and Marq. of Northampton.

NOrthumberland is a more contracted name now, than in former times. Heretofore
it included all the Countries on the North of Humber, possessed of old by the
B^igan^^s, and the Ottadini, now only the extreme and most northern part,
betwixt the rivers of Tine and Twede, all which the Oltadini once inhabited.
The air exceeding sharp and piercing, as being often visited with boystrous
winds, hard frosts, and tedious snows; to remedy which it yields abundance of
sea-coale for fuel, and at very cheap rates. The soil in general neither
fertile for corn or pasturage, as being for the most part exceeding rough and
very hard to be manured, only in some parts toward the sea, by the late
industry of the ploughman, and benefit of sea-weed, wherewith they do improve
their ground, it is become indifferent fruitful. The Country meanly populous,
and but ill inhabited, partly by reason of the barrenness of the Country, as
before is said, and partly for the bad neighborhood of the Scots, as commonly
it is in March-lands or frontier countries. In this regard, it had almost as
many Castles for defense of themselves* as is Parish Churches for the service
of God, there being 26 of the one, and but 46 of the other; but then withal
the P^^^shes were and are exceeding large, and have many Chapels of ease
perteining to the^, which inconvenienc^ of the soil and seat may possibly have
been the reason why the possession of it held not long in any Family (although
the title and possession of it had been given to many) until the Percyes: who
not without some interruption too, have continued long. By reason of which
intermixture of several Families; it has given to those Families the several
titles of Duke, and Earls of Northumberland.

NORWICH.
NOrwich is the chief City of Norfolk, and took that name as did the County,
from the Northern situation of it. It stands upon the river of Yare, which
runs thence to Yarmouth, lying out in length a mile and an half; not above
half so much in breadth, and in that space contains about 30 Parishes; well
walled about with many a turret, and 12 gates for entrance. A City which for
fair buildings, and resort of people, the painful industry of the common
^ort, the great humanity of the richer, and the firm loyalty of all, in
seditious times, may justly be accounted the 3 of England. Amongst the
buildings those of special note (next unto their Churches) are the 2 Palaces
of the D. of Norfolk, and earls of Surrey. And for the wealth and opulence,
which it now enjoys, it stands much indebted to the Net^erlanders, who
flying from the D. of Alva, and the Inquisition, brought with them the making
of baies and says and other manufactures; whereby the poor are set on work,
and the rich grow pursie. A place that has been honored long with a see
Episcopal, but never made a title of Civil honor, till 1626 Edw. L. Denny of
Walthan was cr. E. of Norwich, a Car. Aug. 24. Mort sans issue masle.

NOTTINGHAM.
NOttinghamsh* anciently was a part of the Coritani, well watered with the river
of Trent, and many other pleasant streams. The people generally divide it into
the sand, and the clay; that being the E. part, taking up the forest of
Sherwood, famous for Rob. Hood, and his companions, this being the South, and
Eastern part, more fruitful, and more fit for corn; and throughout well
furnished both with wood and coal. It contains in it 168 Parishes, of which
the chief, and that from whence the shire takes name is Nottingham. A Town
well seated on the Trent, though very high up on an hill which overlookes it:
for buildings, and fair streets, and a spacious market place, not giving way
to many Cities. But that which gave the greatest ornament unto it, was indeed
the Ca^^le, a Royal and magnificent building, which for strength,
stateliness, and command of prospect, may justly challenge the precedence of
the best in Eng. Of Mortime^s hole there, who was hence haled to his execution,
and of the long imprisonment which David K. of Scots here suffered, the people
are as good as a common Chronicle, and intermixe too, not afew Fables with the
truth of story. But that which we have good record for, without fraud or
fiction, is that it has af^orded in successive Ages, these Lords and Earls of
Nottingham.

OXFORD.
Oxfordshire is a part of the Dobuni, situated Northward of the Thames, which
parts it all along from Berkshire. A plentiful and fruitful Country,
wherein the plains are garnished with cornefields and meadows, the hills well
covered with woods and the downs with sheep, and wanting in no kind of
pleasure, which either hawke or hound can afford a Gentleman. It conteines in
it, being no great circuit, 270 Parish Churches, and 10 market towns, the
chief of which in name and beauty, giving denomination to the County, is the
famous City and University of Oxford. A fair and goodly City, both for site
and building; whether one look on the magnificence of the public structures,
or the compacted uniformity of private houses. And sure it may be said without
immodesty and heard without dislike or envy, that for the stateliness of the
Schools and public Library; the bravery and beauty of particular Colleges,
all built of fair and polished stone; the liberal endowments of those houses,
and notable encouragements of industry and learning in the salary of the
Professors in most Arts and Sciences; it is not to be parallelled in the
Christian world: and for the number of her studens, and the well ordering of
those Students by good laws and ordinances, not to be equalled by any but her
sister Cambridge. From whence it had the name of Oxford, is adhuc sub judice:
whether of Vadum Isidos, the ford of Ouse or Isis, on whose banks it stands,
and so called Ousford; or Vada boum, the ford of Oxen (as the Greeks had their
Bosphori in former times) I determine not. Suffice it that this name is very
ancient, and that it anciently has been an University or seat of learning; in
which respect, it has co-evity with that of Paris, if not priority above it,
as being refounded by K. Alf^ed, Anno 806, after it had been overborne a while
by the Danish fury. Colleges it conteine^h in all 18. Hals for students 6, and
about 13 Paris^ Churches. It is moreover a see (...) and it has withal
received no small honor from the noble (...) of the Veres, who now for 20
generations (...) been Earls of Oxford.

PEMBROKE.
PEmbrok-shire was inhabited of old by the Dimetae, a Country quite surrounded
by the Sea, save where it joyneth unto Cardigan and Carmarthen shires: A
Country plentiful in corn and Cattle, not destitute of pitcoale; and which
is far above the rest (as Giraldus tells us) considering that it is so near to
Ireland, of a temperate and wholesome Air. It conteines in it 140 Parish
Churches, and 5 Markets; that which is most of note being Milford, renowned for
its safe and capacious haven. But that from which it takes denomination, is the
town of Pembrok, seated upon a forked arm of Milford haven, and in the best
part of all the Country. A town consisting principally of one long street on a
long narrow point of rock; and has within the walls there of, two Churches. The
Earls hereof in former times were County Palatines, and passed al things that
concerned that County under the seal of the Earldom. And it continued so
until the reign of H. 8. when as Wales was reduced to England, and the
authority of the great Lords there, dissolved by Parliament. Since which the
Earls of Pembrok have been merely titular, as of other places, and of each
sort were these in their several Ages, the Marq. and Earls of Pembrok.

PETERBVRGH.
OF Peterburgh, as it is an Epi^copall see, we have spoke already and have not
much to add of it, as it has the title of an Earldom. It stands in the very
nooke or angle of Northamptonshire, where formerly had been a gulf or whirle
poole of exceeding depth: but made firm ground by Wolpher K. of the Mercians,
when with great pains and diligence, he laid the foundation of the Church. A
Town, but for the Church, of no great note, as standing out of the way for
trade and traffic, and seated in no plausible place, whether one look to
health or pleasure. Yet by occasion of the Abbey in the former times, and now
by reason of the Bishop there; it draws resort of people for dispatch of
business, has a large marketplace, a fair Parish Church, and 2 handsome
streets. Of late unto the Ecclesiastical relation of it is joined an
honourary, it pleasing he Kings Majesty that now is, to create 1627 John L.
Mordant, E. of Peterburgh, 3 Car. March. 9. who now enjoyes that title, Anno
1641.

PORTLAND.
POrtland, was once a little Island, but now adjoyneth to the mainland of
Dorset-shire, lies full against the good town of Weymouth, and seems to take
th^s name from Port, a noble Saxon, who about the year 703 infested and
annoyed these Coasts, and made here his station. It is not above 7 miles in
compass, and very scatteringly inhavited; but plentiful enough of corn, and
good for pastures. On the East side it has a Church on the North a Castle,
which seems to guard the entrance of Weymouth haven. But however it was in
former times, it is now remarkable, it gave and gives the style of Earl, 1632
1 Richard Lord Weston, L. high T^ created Earl of Portland, Feb. 15. 8 Car.
1635 2 Hier. Weston now E. of Portland, Anno 1641.

RICHMOND.
RIchmond-shire is no County of it self, but a part of Yorkshire lying
toward the North-west, with rugged rocks and swelling mountains, whose sides
in some places bear good grass, the bottomes underneath not being
unfruitful; and in the hills themselves are found good mines of lead and
pitcoale. The chief Town of the whole is Richmond, of a small circuit in the
walls, but by reason of the Suburbs lying out in length, very well peopled and
frequented. A Town first built by Alane E. of Bretagne, the first E. here,
after the entrance of the Normans, who fenced it with a wall and a most strong
Castle, the better to assure these parts against the English, and having
finished the same according to his own content, gave it the name of Richmount,
as a place equally participating of strength and beauty. It stands on the
banks of the river of Swale, which with a mighty noise runs underneath it: A
River reputed very sacred by ancient English, for that in it, Paul^nus the
first Archb. of ^orke baptized in one day above 100^0 men, besides women and
children. The Earls of Bretagne for a long time together continued in the
title and possession of this Country: Since it has been bestowed upon other
Families, who in their several times have been adorned with the style of Dukes
and Earls of Richmond.

RIVERS.
THe title of Earl Rivers is of different nature from all the rest of England,
those being local (that of E. Marsh. excepted) and this nominall: those taking
their denomination from some special place, and this from an illustrious
Family. The ancient name was Redve^s, or de Ripariis, thence it came to Rivers.
At first they were but Barons of Plimpton in the County of Devon; after they
came to be Earls of Devonsh. which title 8 of them enjoyed successively, and
then the masculine issue failing, the name and patrimony both were lost amongst
the females or heirs general. From some of these, as I conjecture, came S.
Rich. Woddeville, whom first K. H. 6. advanced unto the honorable title of L
Rivers, and after Edw. 4. marrying his daughter, advanced him higher, and made
him E. Rivers. Which title ending in the 3 E. of this name and Family, was
since again revived in the honorable houses of Darcy and Savage, this last
deriving a descent hereto by the line of Worcester, and Huntington, from one of
the daught. and coheires of the first E. Rivers, whom and his successors take
in order, thus 1466 1 Rich Woodville, L. Tr. and L. Con. father of Qu. Eliz.

virtue of a special entaile in the said creation, succeeded him in the titles
of Earl Rivers, and Visc. Colchester, is now living, 1641.

RVTLAND.
RVtland, for quantity, is the least Country of Eng. for quality not inferior
to the very best, as being a pleasant and fruitful Country, especially about
the vale of Catmosse. The earth thereof is generally very red of color, so red
that even the fleeces of the ^heep are colored with it; in which regard it had
the name of Rudland* the Saxons calling that Rud, which we now call Red, as we
retain the use of Ruddy still, in the selfsame sense. Heretofore it was
reckoned for a part of Northampton-sh. not made a County till of late; and now
again is laid unto Northampton-sh* the better to make up a Diocese for the sea
of Peterburgh. It contineth in it but 48 Parish Churches in the whole; the
chief of which are Vppingham and Oakham, two small market towns, of which the
last is the shire town for the Assizes, Sessions, and all public businesses.
Yet small and little though it be, can show the seats and titles of 4
Parliamentary Barons; and besides that has honored many a noble person with

SALISBVRY.
SAlisbury is the chief City of Wil^sh. anciently called Sorbio^unum, which
name it held until the entrance of the Saxons, who gave new names and laws to
all parts of Eng. ^t was at first seated high upon an hill, as being a place
designed for strength and war, yet honored for a while with a Bishops see, and
a fair Cathedral. But the Bishops and the Clergy finding no good quarter
amongst the Soldiers, which were there in garrison, and being destitute of
water on so dry an hill; about the time of Rich. 1, began to leave it, and
plant themselves down lower by the water side. Being once settled there, and
raising a new Minster for Gods public service, the people also followed after,
and left old Sarum to it self, which in short space became so totally deserted,
that now the ruins of it are hardly visible. But for new Salisbury, that grew
up presently into great renown, plea^antly seated on the river, which watreth
every street thereof, and for the populousness of the place, plenty of
provision, a spacious market place, and a fair Townhall, is esteemed to be the
second City of all this Tract. And which adds no small luster to it, a place
that has been very fortunate in those eminent persons, on whom the Kings of
England have bestowed the title of Earls of Salisbury.

SHREWSBVRY.
SHrewsbury is the principal town in Shropshire, called by our Ancestors the
Saxons Scrobbesbyrig, for that it was of old a very thicket of shrobs. A place
that rose out of the ruins of old Vriconium, seated not far off; but grew not
into any great request till the Norman Conquest. The town stands nea^ly on a
hill, and is almost encompassed round by the river Severn: that part thereof
which is not fenced by the River, being fortified with a very strong Castle
built by Roger de Montgomery, the first E. hereof. A fair and goodly Town it
is, well traded and frequented by all sorts of people both Welsh and Eng. by
reason of the trade of cloth, and other merchandise; this being the common mart
or empory between Wales and Eng. It stands in the very midst or center, as it
were, of the whole County, which generally is inferior unto none about it, for
delight and plenty; and for the number of Towns and Castles' standing
exceeding thick on every side (as having formerly been a frontier-Country) very
far above them. It belonged anciently to the Cornavii, and presently on the
Norman Conquest, was bestowed on Roger de Montgom. whom before I spoke of, who
and his successors, and since them the honorable Family of the Talbots, enjoyed
the style and title of Earls of Shrewsbury.

SOMERSET.
SOmersetsh. anciently was inhabited by the Belga. A Country of a fertile
soil, hoth for corn and pasture, exceeding populous ^as comprehending in the
whole 385 Parish Churches, whereof 33 are market towns) and furnished also with
commodious havens for trade and traffic. A Country howsoever pleasant in the
Summer season; yet in the Winter time so deep and miery, that it is scarce
passable; from whence the people have a proverb, that it is bad for the Rider,
but good for the abider. Yet in some parts the^eof, those specially which are
toward Wiltsh. it is both hilly and stony; but in the bowels of those hills,
particularly in those of Mendip, they find rich veins of lead, to the great
enriching of the Country, and benefit to all the Kingd. It took this name from
Somerton, once the most famous and considerable in all the County, now a small
market Town of no note nor credit, but for a fair of Cattle which is kept
there yearly; in which respect Ass^rius calls it, Comitatum Somertunensem, or
Somertonsh. But by the name of Somerset it is now best known, and by that name
has given the honorary title of Dukes, and Earls to

SOUTHAMPTON.
SOuthampton is the 2 Town of Hamp-shire, in bigness and circuit, but not
inferior to the first for wealth and riches. A Town commodiously seated on an
arm of the sea, and capable of ships of burden to the very Keie; the
opportunity whereof has made it very fair and populous, as having in it 5
Churches for Gods public service, fenced with strong walls and a double ditch,
and to secure the haven with a right strong Castle, which now time has ruined.
It stands on the banks of the river of Anton, (which rising about Andover,
runs here into the Sea) from whence it had the name of Southampton and by that
name has given denomination to the whole Country, though generally it be
called Hamp-shire. A Country rich in all commodities, both of sea and land, and
in the upper parts thereof, those which are farthest from the sea, of a very
pure and excellent air. It conteines in it 253 Parishes, many of which have
Chapels of ease as big as Parish* besides those in the Isle of Wight, which is
reckoned for a part of Hantshire. To return back unto the Town, which though it
be within the County, yet is a County in it self (for which it stands
beholding to K. H. 6.) And both before and since has been counted worthy to be
the highest honourary title of Dukes, and Earls to
1067 1 Beauvois of Hampton, that famous Soldier so much talked of. 1^27 2

STAFFORD.
STaffordsh. apperteined anciently to the Cornubii, a potent people in these
parts, which afterward by Beda, were called Angli mediteranei, or the midland
Englishmen. A Country on the north part full of hills, and woods; on the South,
stored with coals and mines of iron; and in the middle part where it is watered
with the Trent, bravely adorned with meadows, and fair fields of corn. It
contains in it 120 villages with Parish Churches, the City, or Episcopal see
of Lichfeild, and 12 other market Towns, of which the chief is Staff. on the
river of Owe; the head Town of the shire, which from thence takes name. A Town
exceedingly beholding to the Barons of Staf. who were once Lords hereof and
were hence denominated: who both procured it to be made a Borough, with ample
privileges, by K. John, and also fenced it with a wall, save where it was
secured by a large poole of water on the East and North. And on the other side,
the Town by way of thankful retribution, honored that noble Family with the
style of E. who were from hence entitled in their several ages, Earls, and
Lords and Visc. of Stafford.

STAMFORD.
STamford is the hithermost Town of Lincoln-sh. seated upon the river W^lland,
by which it is there parted from Northampton-sh. It stands in that part
thereof, which is called Kesteven, of which it is the principal town A town
well peopled and of great resort, containing about 7 Parish Churches. But that
which gives it most renown, is that upon some quarrel and contention between
the Southern and Northern men in the University of Oxford, the Scholle^s in the
reign of King Edw. 3 removed hither, and here held publiqueschooles of al sorts
of learning. Nor did they leave the place, or return again, until they were
commanded so to do by the Kings Proclamation, and thereupon it was ordained in
the University, that the ^chollers in the taking of their degrees, should make
oath, not to read publicly at Stamford, to the prejudice of Oxford.
Nevertheless the Town still flourished in trade and merchandise, and does now
give the title of an Earl to 1628 Hen. L. Gray of Groby, cr E. of Stamf. 3
Car. March. 26, now living. Anno 1641.

STRAFFORD.
STrafford, or Strasforth is the name of a Wapontake, or hundred, in the
West Riding of Yorkshire, and lies on the South thereof, where it abutteth on
the Counties of Nottingham and Darby. A territory of a large extent, conceived
to be almost as big, as the whole County of Rutland, and in it comprehending
the good towns of Sheafeld, Rotheram, Doncaster, and the honor of Tickhil,
besides many smaller Villages and Hamlets. The ancient Family of the
Wentworths, out of which comes the Earl of Cleveland, have long flourished
here, and have their seat at Wentworth-Wood house, and many a fair and large
possession in this Wapontake. In which consideration, it was selected purposely
for the highest title of 1639 Tho. Visc Wentworth, L. Newmerch and ^versley,
and L. Deputy of Ireland, cr. E. of Stafford and Baron of Raby, with great
solemnity at Whitehall, 15 Car. Ian 12, and shortly after L. Lieut. of Ireland.

SVffolk was anciently part of the Iceni, and afterward together with
Cambridg-sh. and Norfolk, made up the Kingdom of the East Angles, of which
this being the Southern part gave to the Count. and the people both the name
of Southfolk. A very large and spacious country, containing 575 Parish. Chur.
of the which 28 are market towns, with many a safe and capacious haven. Of
those the most remarkable toward the sea, is Ipswich, a very fair and
spacious town, well peopled and well traded too: adorned with 14 Churches for
the service of God, and many a fair* and goodly edifice for private use. That
of most credit in the Island is Bury, or S. Edmundsbury, heretofore famous for
the Abbey, valued at the suppression at 2336l. 16 s. per ann. a fine neat town,
and much inhabited by the Gentry, who resort thither from all parts of the
Country. As for the Coun. it self it shows in every place most rich and
goodly fields of corn, with grounds as battaille and rich for the feeding of
Cattle, whereof there is good plenty out of question, as may appear by the
great store of cheese here made and vented to the great commodity of the
inhabitants, not only into all parts of Eng. but Spain, France and Germany.
Long time it was, before the title of Suffolk was conferred on any. But when
the Gapp was opened once, it has been severally conferred on several Families,
who as they stood in grace and favor with their Princes, attained the titles
of Dukes, Marq. and Earls of Suffolk.

SVNDERLAND.
SVnderland is a demy-Island in the North-East part of the Bishopric of
Durham, over against the mouth of the river of Were; which being pulled a
sunder from the land, by the force of the Sea, has the name of Sunderland A
place of no great note or reputation, till it was made the title of 1627
Emanuel Lord Scrope of Bolton and Lord President of the North, created Earl of
Sunderland, 3 Car. Iun. 19. Mort sans issue.

SVRREY.
SVrrey and Sussex anciently were inhabited by the Regni, and afterward made
up the Kingdom of the South Saxons. This lies on the South of the river
Thames, whence it had the name; the Saxons calling that Rea, which we call a
River: and so from Sutbrea, came the name of Surrey. A Country on the outward
parts thereof very rich and fruitful, especially on that side which is toward
the Thames, where it yields plenty both of corn and grass; but in the middle
part, somewhat hard and barren. From whence the people use to say, that their
Country is like a course piece of cloth, with a fine list. And yet the middle
parts thereof what they want in riches, they supply with pleasures, as being
famous for good air, and well stored with parks; the downs affording
excellent opportunity as well for horseraces, as hunting. A Country finally it
is of no great quantity. and ye^ conteines 140 Parishes (of the which 8 are
market towns) and amongst them the Royal mansions of Richmond, Otelands and
Non^-such. The chief town of the whole is Guilford, a fine neat town, seated
on the declining of an hill toward the river Mole, consisting of 3 Parish
Churches; which notwithstanding never gave title unto any, of Lord, Earl of
higher. But that defect has been supplied by the whole body of the County, in
the name of Surrey, with which our Kings have dignified these Dukes and Earls.

SUSSEX.
Sussex is the other part of the old possessions of the Regnians after that of
the South Saxons, from whom it took the name of Suths^x. A Country that lies
all along the Ocean in a goodly length, extending East and West above 60 miles;
and yet for all so long a Coast has very few havens, the shore being full of
rocks and shelves, and the wind impetuous. The Northern parts toward Kent and
Surrey are well shaded with woods, as was all the Country heretofore, until
the Iron works consumed them. The Souther^e parts which are toward the sea,
lying upon a chalk or marle, yield come abundantly; with a delightful
intermixture of groves and meadows. It conteines in it to the number of 312
Parishes, of which 18 are market towns. And amongst these the chief of note is
Chichester, of which we need say nothing here* having spoke of it its proper
place, amongst the Bishoprics. It now rests only that I giv^ you a compendious
Catalogue of the Earls of Sussex.

THANET.
THanet is a little Island in the North-East of Kent, environed on 3 parts by
the sea, and toward the West, severed from the mainland of Kent, by the river
of Stoure, which is here called Yenlade. An Island by Solinus called Athanatos,
in some copies Thanatos; from whence the Saxons had their Thanet, famous as in
other things, so in these particulars, that it was here the Sax. landed when
they came first for Britani; and that S. Austin the Monk here landed also, when
he brought the Gospel to the Saxons. The whole about 8. m. in. leng. and 4 in
brea. was reckoned then to hold about 600 Families: and is now very populous
for the bigness, and very plentiful withal of all commodities necessary, but
of cor^ especially. The people generally are a kind of Amphibii, and get their
livings both by sea and land, being well skilled according to the year, as well
in stearing of a ship at sea, as holding of the plough at land* and in both
courses notably industrious. Such is the Isle of Tha^et, which was to late
times made the title of an Earldome, in the persons of 1628 1 Nico. L. Tufton.

TOTNES.
TOtnes is a Town in the Southwest of Devonshire, situate on the banks of the
River of Dert, about 6 miles from its influxe into the Sea. An ancient little
Town it is, and stands on the fall of an hill, lying East and West. It has a
Major for the chief Magi^trate, and so has had ever since the time of K.
John; and being a borough town withal, has a vote in Parliament. The
greatest reputation which it had in the former times, was that it gave the
title of an Archdeacon, to one of 4 Archdeacons of the Diocese of Exeter,
who is hence called Archdeacon of Totnes, And by that name George Carew,
D^ctor in Divinity (after Deane of Windsore, etc.) subscribes the Acts of
Convocation, A^^^ 1536. which possibly may be the reason, why 162^ George L.
Carew of Clopton, son of the said George, desired, as he enjoyed, the title of
E. of Totnes, unto the which he was advanced, 1 Car. Feb. Mort ^a^^s issue.

WARWICK.
WArwickshire heretofore was part of the Cornavii, a Country which for air and
soil, wants nothing for the profit or pleasure of man. It is divided into two
parts by the river. Avon, that on the South side being called the Feldon, which
yields good store of corn, and grass, and makes a lovely prospect from the
neighboring hills; that on the North being called the Woodland, from the great
plenty of woods which grew here formerly, but now grown thin enough by the
making of iron. It contains in it 158 Parishes and market towns; of which the
chief (...) one exclude Coventry as a County of it self) is that of Warwick,
called by the Romans anciently Praesidium, from the garrison there, which name
it still retains in a different language. A town adorned with very fair
houses, a strong and well compact stone bridge on the river Avon, and two
goodly Churches: But the chief beauty of it heretofore, as now, is a most
stately and magnificent Castle; which as it was of late repaired at the great
cost and charges of Sir Fulk Grevill, the late L. Broks, who therein dwelt; so
was it anti^ntly the seat and abiding place of the Dukes and Earls of Warwick.

WESTMORLAND.
WEstmorland was a part of the possessions of the old Brigantes, and lies on
the West of York^sh. from whence and from the Mores, as they call them here
(that is, those barren heathy grounds, which are not tractable for corn) it was
named West-more-land. The air accounted sharp and piercing; the soil in most
parts barren and unprofitable; yet in the Vales, which are neither large nor
man^, indifferently fruitful. So that the greatest profit and commodity, which
here the people make unto themselves, is by the benefit and trade of clothing.
It contains in it only 26 Parishes, which plainly shows that either the
Country is not very populous, or that the Parishes are exceeding large, as
ge^erally indeed they are, in these Northern parts; 4 of those 26 are market
towns, the chief of which next Kendale (which we ^pake of formerly) is called
Appleby, and passes for the shire town or head of the County. The Viponts
anciently, and by them the ^lyffords were the hereditary Sherifs hereof; which
notwithstanding* it pleased K. R. 2, to add unto the titles of the Nevils of
Raby, the higher and more eminent style of Earls of Westmorland.

WILTSHIRE.
WIltsh, belonging to the Relgae in the former times, took this new name from
Wilton, once the chief town of it; like as it of the river Willy, on the which
it stands. A region which as it breeds a race of hardy men, who in old time,
with those of Devonsh. and Cornwall, challenged the seconding of the main
battaille in our Eng. armies; so is it very plentiful and fruitful, and
withal very pleasant and delightsome. The middle parts thereof, which they
call the Plains, are most scant of corn; but those plains being large and
spacious, and reaching round about to the horizon, do feed innumerable flocks
of sheep, which bring as great commodity to the inhabitants by their fleece and
wool, and the most gainefull trad of clothing, as other parts that are more
fertile. It contei^eth in it 304 Parish* and is traded in 19 market towns; the
chief and fairest are Salisbury and Marlborough, which before we spoke of.
Wilton was formerly the principal, and here^ofore a Bishops see, honored with
the residence of 9 several Bishops: But by translating of the sea of
Salisbury, and carrying thi^her therewithal the throughfare into the West
country, which before was here, it fell by little and little to decay, and is
now hardly worth the reputation of a poor market town, yet still it gives
denomination to the Country: as that the style and honor to these Earls of
Wiltshire.

WINCHELSEY.
WInchelsey is a sea Town in the East part of Sussex, where it adjoyneth upon
Kent, accounted by a general error to be open of the Cinq Ports; whereas indeed
it is no Cinq port, but a member of them, as ^hi^ and Feversham, and others
are. A Town in former times of great strength and beauty, enclosed with strong
walls, and a well placed Rampire, for the defense thereof against foreign
force: but the sea-shrinking from it by little and little, brought the town by
the like degrees into great decay, though still it bear the show of a handsome
town, and has a Blockhouse for defense raised by H. ^. But what it lost i^
wealth, it has got in honor, being advanced unto the reputation of an Earld.

WINCHESTER.
WInch. is the chief City of H^^psh. and heretofore the seat Royal of the
West Saxon K. By Antonine and P^olomy called Venta Belgarum; and then accounted
the prime City of all the Belgae, out of which Venta, adding ceaster to it,
(according to their wonted manner) the Saxons hammered their Vent-ceaster, and
we our Winchester. In these our days, it is indifferently well peopled, and
frequented, commodiou^ly seated in a Valley between high steep hills, by which
it is de^ended from cold and wind. It lies daintily on the banks of a pleasant
river, str^tching somewhat in length from East to West, and contains about a
mile and a half within the walls, besides* the suburbs; but much within the
walls is desolate and altogether unbuilt. Many things certainly thereare which
may conduce unto the reputation of it, especially a beautiful and large
Cathedral, a goodly and capacious Palace for the Bishops dwelling, which they
call Wolvescy house; a strong and gallant Castle bravely mounted upon an hill,
with brave command on all the Country; a pretty neat College near the walls,
built and endowed by Will. of Wickham, for a seminary to his other in Oxford;
and not far off a very fair Hospital, which they call Saint Crosses. And yet
lest all this might not raise it high enough, our English Monarchs have thought
fit to dignifie these following persons with the style and title of Marq. and
Earls of Winchester.

WOrcestersh. is a part of the Cornavii, once a great nation in these parts. A
Coun. of an air so temperate, and a soil so fortunate, that it gives place to
none about her, for health and plenty. Abundant certainly it is in all kinds of
fruits, and of pears especially; wherewith, besides the use they have of them
for the table, they make a bastard kind of wine, which they here call Pirry,
which they both sell and drink in great abundance. Saltpits it also has in
some parts thereof, and about Powyck, and many places else good store of
Cherries: and every where well watered with delicious rivers, which afford great
variety of fish. A Country of no great extent for length and compass, as not
containing above 152 Parish Churches, and amongst them 10 market towns. Of
these the principal is Worcester, and gives denomination to the whole. A City
delectably seated on the banks of Severne (which runs quite through the
County from North to South) ever which it has a fair bridge with a tower upon
it: and thence arising with a gentle ascent, affords to the upper parts, a
very goodly prospect in the vale beneath. A City every way considerable,
whether you look upon it in the situation, or in the number of its Churches,
or the fair neat houses, or finally on the inhabitants, which are both
numerous and wealthy, by reason of their trade of clothing, which does there
flourish very much. Of the Cathed* here we have spoke before, and of the Castle
we shall now say nothing, as having nothing left of it but the name and ruins.
All we shall add is a brief Nomenclature of The Earls of Worcester.

YORK.
Yorkshire is past all peradventure the greatest County in England, containing
70 miles in length from North to South, and 80 miles in breadth from West to
East; the circuit being above 300. In this great quantity of ground, are not
above 563 Parish Churches, which is no great number, but then withal there are
great plenty of Chapels of Ease, equal for bigness and resort of people, to
any Parish. elsewhere. The soil is generally fruitful in a very good measure.
If that one part thereof by stony and barren ground; another is as fertile and
as richly adorned with corn and pasturage: If here you find it naked and
destitute of woods* in other places you shall find it shadowed with most
spacious forests: If it be somwhere moorish, mirie and unpleasant; elsewhere
it is as beauteous and delightsome as the eye can wish. It is divided
ordinarily into 3 parts, which according to the quarters of the world are
called East Riding, West Riding, and North Riding; Richmondsh. ^omming in to
make up the 4, which is a part of York-sh. as before was said. The whole was
anciently possessed by the Brigantes, who were diffused all over those
Northern parts, beyond the Trent; and for their capital City had Eboracum,
seated upon the river Ure which we now call Ouse) in the Westriding of this
County; and by a later Saxon name is now called York. This is the 2 City of all
Eng. both for fame and greatness; A pleasant large and stately place, well
fortified and beautifully adorned, as well with private as public edifices,
and rich and populous withal; Seated (as e^st was said) on the river Ouse,
which cutteth it, as it were, in twain; both parts being joined together with
a fair stone bridge, consisting of high and mighty Arches. A City of great
fame in the Roman times, and of as eminent reputation in all Ages since; and in
the several turns and changes, which have befallen this Kingdom under the
Saxons, Danes and Normans, has still preserved i^s ancient luster. Adorned it
was with an Archiepiscopall see in the times of the Britans; nor stooped it
lower when the Saxons ^eceived the Faith. Rich. 2. laying unto it a little
territory on the Westside thereof, made it a County of it self, in which the
Archbishops of York enjoy the rights of Palatines. And for a further luster to
it, H. ^. ap. pointed here a Council for the governance of the Northern parts,
consisting of a L. Pre. certain Counselors, a Secretary and other Officers.
And yet in none of these has York been more fortunate, than that it adorned so
many Princes of the Imperial line of Germany and blood Royal of England, with
the style and attribute of Dukes and Earls of York.
