A Spiritual or Heavenly SALUTATION To all the Tenderhearted in CHRISTENDOM,
That are seeking the Kingdom of God and the Righteousness thereof, which I
desire and entreat them to Read over these following Lines, in the love of God,
in which they are sent to them from him that desires the good of all Mankind
here, and their Eternal happiness hereafter.

A SPIRITUAL or HEAVENLY Salutation, etc.
TO all the tender Hearted in Christendom, whose Faces are turned toward
Heavenly Jerusalem, and whose Minds are turned and drawn by the Spirit of God
to Christ, who is the new and living way to God, and the one Mediator betwixt
God and Man; who enlightneth every one that comes into the World, with his
Heavenly Divine Light, which is the life in Christ the Word, by whom all things
were Made and Created; Christ says, Believe in the Light, that ye may become
Children of the Light, so Christ who is not of the World but from above, has
given us his Light to believe in, and to walk in, that we may have the Light of
life, and he that believes is a Child of Light and born of God, and overcomes
the World; and passes from the Death that came by Adam, and is engrafted into
Christ the life, the second Adam, and so are living Stones or Members of him
the living Head; and the Children of this Light that walk in this Light, have
fellowship with the Son, and the Father, and one with another; and all
Christendom that walk not in the Light that Christ has given you, are not in
this Heavenly Divine fellowship. But this Prophecy we do witness fulfilled and
fulfilling concerning Christ; God said, I will give him for a Covenant of the
People, and a Light to the Gentiles, and he shall be my Salvation to the ends
of the Earth, Isa. 49.6, 8. So that they that come to know their Salvation, and
into Covenant with God, they must come into the Light of Christ which gives
the Light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ Jesus,
which Light shines in their Hearts, the Heavenly treasure in the Earthen
Vessels; and if all that is called Christendom, had believed in the Light, the
life in Christ, which Christ gives and teaches to Believe in that which he
gives them, then had they been all Children of the Light, and of the Day of
Christ, in Unity and Fellowship in the Light, and then they had not made so
many Faiths and Beliefs which they have destroyed one another about. And if all
Christendom had observed the Apostles Doctrine to the Church of Christ, who
exhorted them to look to Jesus the Author and finisher of their Faith, then
they would not have made so many Faiths, about which they have Persecuted one
another: Whereas no manner of Men below, can make a Catholic Divine Faith; for
I say, that Christ Jesus is the Beginner and Finisher of our Holy, Divine,
Precious, Catholic or Universal Faith, which he the Holy one, does reveal from
Faith to Faith; and the Mystery of this holy Faith is held in a pure
Conscience, and not in an impure one; and it purifies the Heart and gives
Victory over that which displeases God, and separates from God, in which holy
Faith, which we have from the holy One, we please the holy God which gives us
the Victory over that which displeases him, and separates from him, and have
access to him: In this holy Divine Faith is our Unity; so Christ has the
honor, who is the Author of our Faith, and Finisher of it, and likewise gives
us his Light; the Life in himself; so he is the Author of our Belief to Believe
in. -- And happy had all Christendom been, had they kept to the Apostles
Doctrine, to the Church of Christ, who said, the Grace of God that brings
Salvation, has appeared unto all men, and teaches us, namely Christians, then
and now, to live Godly, Righteously, and Soberly, and deny Vnrighteouness and
Worldly Lusts. Now I say, happy had all Christians been since the Apostles
days, if they had kept to this Grace of God their teacher, which would have
brought their Salvation, and would have brought them into Favor with God; if
they had, then there would not have been so many itching Ears, and have set up
so many Schools and Colleges to make Teachers, which brings Christendom into
confusion one against another. Some may say, is this Grace sufficient? God said
to Paul, it was sufficient, when he was in his Trials and Temptations; and
Thousands can Witness, that the Grace of God is sufficient, and does teach them
what to deny, and how to live, and does bring their Salvation; for as the Law
came by Moses, in the Old Testament, and the Jews were to live under it; and
Grace and Truth is come by Jesus in the New Testament, and this Grace and Truth
is in the Hearts of Gods People, and they are under Grace's teaching, and in
the Covenant of Grace; for Christ by the Grace of God tasted Death for every
man, that they may all come out of the Death in Adam, to the Light and Life in
him; by his Light, Grace, Truth, and Faith in their Hearts; that he is the
Author of; for there is a Prophecy in Joel, That God would pour out his spirit
upon all flesh, which the Apostles, in Acts 2. show the fulfilling of to the
Jews; and now, what is the matter that all the Sons, Daughters, Servants,
Handmaids, and Old-men in Christendom, have not their Heavenly Prophecies,
Visions, and Dreams? Is it not because they have erred from the Spirit of God,
and vex, quench, and grieve it, that he has poured upon them, and become like
the Jews; to whom God gave his good Spirit, but they Rebelled against it?
therefore is not all Christendom on heaps one against another, out of
fellowship? therefore the means by which all Christendom, and all People are to
come into Unity and Fellowship in the Spirit, is, that they must Come all into
the Spirit that God has poured upon them, by which Spirit they must be
Circumcised; and have the Body of Sin and Death cut off, which they came into
by Transgression in Adam, who had none before he fell; and they must be
Baptized with the Spirit, to plunge down Sin by this Spirit; I say, all must be
Baptized into one Body, and so all to Drink into one Spirit; this Spirit of God
brings all into Fellowship and Unity, for the Spirit of God is the bond of
Peace, and in it is the profiting; and it opens the Heavenly Prophecies,
Visions, and Dreams to Gods People now, as it did in the Apostles days. Christ
Jesus set up a Worship above Sixteen hundred Years ago, in the Spirit and in
the Truth, when he put down the Jews Worship at Jerusalem and the Samarinus at
Jacob's- Well, and said; The hour comes, and (...), that they that worship the
Father, must worship him in spirit and in truth, for such he seeks to worship
him; and therefore all must come to the Spirit of God and his Truth in their
Hearts, by which Truth and Spirit in their Hearts, they must know the God of
Truth an infinite Spirit, and in his Truth and in his Spirit, to Worship and
Serve the God of Truth. And if all Christendom had kept to the Truth and Spirit
in their Hearts, they had kept to the Worship that Christ, the Lord from Heaven
had set up (for none can set up a better than he) and then they had not set up
so many Worships, and Persecuted one another about them; but all People must
return to the Spirit of God and the Truth in their Hearts, if they will Serve
and Worship God their Creator; for God is come to teach his People himself, by
his Son; for as the Apostle says, God at sundry times and in diverse manners,
spoke to the Fathers by the Prophets, but now in these last days God has
spoken to us by his Son, who bruises the Serp^^ts head, who has been the head
of all false Speakers and false Religions, Churches, Ways and Worships; but God
is the Speaker now to his People, by his Son, who was the Speaker to Adam in
Paradise, but when Adam forsook Gods Teaching, and followed the Serpents, he
lost his happiness, so have the Jews and the Christians; therefore all must
return by the Spirit, Light, Grace, and Truth of Jesus, to Christ Jesus the
great Prophet, Shepherd, Bishop, Leader, and Counselor, that they may hear God
speak to them by his Son, and he that has the Son has Life, and he that has
not the Son has not Life, though he may make a profession of all the
Scriptures: And none can receive the Son, but by the Light, Grace, and Truth
that comes from him, in their Hearts. Why are not all Christendom the Sons and
Daughters of God, which make a Profession of Christ? Is it not because they do
not receive Christ, in his Grace and Truth in their Hearts, which comes from
him? For Adam and Eve, by eating of that which God forbid, brought Death on
them and their Posterity; and now Christ the second Adam, says, That he is the
Bread from Heaven, and except they eat this Bread from Heaven, etc. that he
gives, they have not Life in him; so by eating came Death, and by eating comes
Life again, it is not by talking. And he gives his Bread from Heaven now, for
he is the Heavenly Bread, Rock, and Foundation, Christ the same to day as
yesterday, and so for ever, to all his People, who was Dead and is alive again,
and Lives for evermore, and Reigns in his People. And now in this Gospel day,
of Christ the new Covenant: God writes his Law in the Hearts of his People, and
puts it in their Minds, that all should know him from the greatest to the
least, and none need say to his Brother, know the Lord, which thousands do
witness this Law of Love, Faith and Life, that all may read what God puts in
their Minds, and writes in their Hearts, and such are heavenly Jerusalem's
Children, who is the Mother of them all; and no Mother can they own below the
heavenly Jerusalem, as the Christians did in the Primitive Times, and such are
the Church of the first Born written in Heaven, clothed with the Sun and the
Moon under her Feet, all changeable Churches, Ways, Worships, Religions and
Teachers, all which change as changeable things, for the Moon changes, but the
Sun does not change but clothes his living Members, who is over his House; the
Royal Priesthood offering up spiritual Sacrifices to God (not Carnal) by Jesus
Christ.

And when Christ sent his Disciples to preach the Gospel to every Creature
under Heaven: It was not with the Penalty of Prisons, Gallows, Fire, and
spoiling of the Goods of them that would not believe and receive them. And
therefore it is time for all that profess Christianity, to put up the Carnal
Sword concerning Religion, and obey Christ's Command, who said he came not to
destroy Men's Lives, but to save them; and therefore love God and Christ, and
one another, and Enemies, for Love and Charity is the most Excellent way above
all tinkling Cymbals, and sounding Brass; for they that dwell in Love dwell in
God.

POSTSCRIPT.
AND all you Teachers that make a Scoff and a Mock at the Motion, or moving of
the Spirit of God; but you had never had the Holy Scriptures which you make a
Trade of, had not the Holy Men of God spoken them forth as they were moved by
the Holy Spirit of God, and this shows that you are erred from the Holy Spirit
of God, that the Apostles were in, and the moving of it, and fellowship in it,
which proceeds from the Father and the Son: And as the Apostle said to the
Church of Christ, That I may know him, and the Power of his Resurrection, and
the Fellowship of his Sufferings, being made conformable unto his Death, Phil.
3.10. This is the right Knowledge of Christ, and the true Conformity.

(...) they that are conformable to Christ, who faith, he is from above and not
of this World, such are not conformable to this World.

And now all you that go under the Name of Christians, Let every one that
names the Name of Christ depart from Iniquity, 2 Timothy 2.19. And if any Man
have not the Spirit of Christ he is none of his, Romans 8.9. And the Apostle
tells the Church of Christ, That no Man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by
the Holy Ghost, 1. Cor. 12.3. And the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father and
the Son, John 15.26. And again the Apostle says to the Corinthians, Examine
your selves whether you be in the Faith, prove your own selves; know ye not
your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except you be Reprobates, 2
Cor. 13.5. And again the Apostle says to the Romans, The Word is nigh thee,
even in thy Mouth, and in thy Heart, and this is the Word of Faith which we
preach, Romans 10.8. And again the Apostle says, The Mystery which has been
from Ages and Generations, but now is manifest unto the Saints; to whom God
would make known what is the Riches of

(...) (...) amabo oscultate: Salemque quo cuncta quae sapiunt dignoscatis in
vobismet retinete; nec minus Oleum in lampadibus vestris semper habete, ut
fatuis virginibus absimiles sitis: Talenta vobis concredita occupantes Pigri
servi censuram evitabitis; declaratio enim Spiritus Dei unicuique ad
proficiendum datur: Nec sitis locutores, aut verbi Dei tantum auditores, verum
illius voluntatis Executores ne vestras seducatis animas semper vosmet
perhibete: Religiosus enim cultus and incontaminatus apud Deum and Patrem hic
est, invisere Orphanos and Viduas in afflictione ipsorum and immaculatum sese
conservare a mundo: Omnes qui Christianam professionem profitentur hunc cultum
Religiosum a mundi maculis immunes reddentem colere oportet; haec enim Religio
omnibus mundi Religionibus maculosis prestantior, suum cultorem mitem,
tenerumque efficit; in quem statum, ut omnes dicti Christiani tandem
perveniant, Deum omnipotentem obnixe rogatum habeo.

Apostolus Christianis veris pronunciavit, vos estis Templum Dei viventis,
sicut dixit Deus, habitabo in eis and inambulabo, and ero illorum Deus and ipsi
erunt mihi Populus. An ignoratis Corpus vestrum esse templum Spiritus Sancti
qui est in ^^bis, quem habetis a Deo, 1 Cor. 6.19. and 2 Cor. 6.16.
Christianitatis Professores ubivis gentium hanc notitiam sibi ratam debent
habere, quod nimirum Corpora earum sint templa Dei viventis: In vetere
testamento Judaei externum teplum habebant, Stephanus vero in novo ait,
Excelsissimus ille in manufactis templis non habitat, Act. 7.46. Sicut ante
dictum, Deus dixit, habitabo in eis and inambulabo, and ero ipsis Deus, and
illi erunt mihi Populus, Corpora enim vestra sunt templa Dei viventis, and
Spiritus Sancti. Hanc itaque notitiam Christiani sibi fide familiarem reddere
debent, Paulus ad hunc modum loquitur, An ignoratis vos esse Templum Dei, and
Spiritum Dei in vobis habitare? siquis Templum Dei violat, hunc perdet Deus,
nam Templum Dei Sanctum est, quod estis vos, 1 Cor. 3.16.17. Omnes itaque qui
Christianitatem profitentur inhabitantem in se Dei Spiritum simulque ipsorum
Corpora esse Dei viventis templa vere cognoscere debent quae ne polluantur
summa cura est adhibenda: Ne Dei manu pereant qui Sanctus est, qui and
sanctitatem ab omnibus suis expectat. Christus Pharisaeis summis veteris
Testamenti Cultoribus dixit, regnum Dei non venire ut observari posset, neque
dicent, ecce hic aut ecce illic, ecce enim regnum Dei intus habetis, Luc.
17.20, 21. Hinc discite, vosmet Explorate an Regnum Dei intus in vobis sitis
experti: Christi sententia est, Regnum Coelorum simile esse fermento, quod
acceptum mulier, indidit in farinae sata tria usquequo fermentaretur tota,
estque simile Regnum Coelorum grano sinapis quod acceptum quispiam sevit in
agro suo: Hoc igitur pacto, vos qui Christiani appellamini vosmet tentate, number
Regnum hoc Margaritam pretiosam in agro vestro abditam offenderitis. Agite
candela accensa, versaque domo, thesaurus hic vasis vestris terrenis
indubitanter a vobis est inveniendus qui eum extra vos hactenus quaesivistis.
Inde fiet ut fermentum Regni ad animas corda and mentes in Massam Coelestem
fermentandum cognoscatis, ut est apud Matt. 13. and Luc. 15. Apostoli quoque
sententia est, neminem nisi Spiritum Dei, quae Dei sunt percipere posse: Nos
vero non Spiritum Mundi accepimus, sed Spiritum qui est ex Deo, ut sciamus quae
Deus nobis gratificatus est, 1 Cor. 2.11.12.

Si modo Christiani Deum, Christum, and quae Deus ipsis gratis absque mercede
aut pretio largitur, rite cognoscere velint, Spiritum Dei in semetipsis
operantem, testari necesse habent. Jescha^us proclamat, Heus, quis uis sitit,
venite ad aquas istas, and vos quibus nulla est Pecunia, venite, comparate
absque Pecunia and absque Pretio, Vinum and Lac: Cur expenditis pecuniam pro
nullo cibo, and laborem vestrum pro re minime satiatura? Auscultate
indesinenter mihi and comedite bonum, atque oblectet se hac pinguedine anima
vestra; inclinate aurem vestram, and venite ad me, audite ut vivat anima
vestra, Jesch. 45.22. Deus enim Spiritum suum in omnem carnem effudit, ut per
eum, Dominum respiciant, salutemque suam adipiscantur. Deus item dicit Omnes
Terrae fines Salutem intuebuntur Dei, quod futurum est per Spiritum, nam Deus
Spiritus est: Inquit Dominus, Justitia mea in saeculum erit and salus mea in
omnes Generationes, Jesch. 51.8. Proclamat Deus per Jeschaiam, fortitudinem
Populi sui in hoc esse, ut maneant, nempe in Spiritu and Potentia Dei, Jesch.
30.7. Huc pertinet and illud expectantes Jehovam, mutant vires, ascendunt
pennis velut aquilae, currunt neque defatigantur, pergunt neque defetiscuntur;
In hoc situm est Solamen expectantium Jehovam, quorum fortitudo in consistendo
sive manendo ponitur, nam hoc pacto Dominum salutem ipsorum intuebuntur; omnes
Filii tui edocti erunt a Jehovah, amplaque erit pax Filic (...) tuorum, in
Justistia stabilientur, Jesch. 54.13. Multa item arma in Filios Dei conficta
non prosperabuntur, omnesque linguas in judicium adversus ipsos insurgentes qui
a Domino edocti erunt, condemnabunt: Nos qui a Domino edocti sumus (quae est
sua erga nos Clementia) arma multa linguasque varias adversum nos in judicium
insurgentes Dominum compressisse testamur: Deus enim suos ad linguas fallaces
judiciaque mendacia confutandum potentia imbuit Filiolos.

De ratione Canendi and Precandi. Pauli Apostoli sententia de ratione Canendi
and Precandi haec fuit, Orabo Spiritu, sed orabo etiam intelligentia, psallam
Spiritu, sed psallam etiam intelligentia: Judae Apostoli ad Ecclesiam Christi
adhortatio fuit, ut Spiritu Sancto orarent, Jud. 20. 1 Cor. 14.15. Libros vero
unde oretur nulli commendabat Apostolus, Spiritu orare and intelligentia,
librorum usum nullo modo implicare videtur: Apostolus dicit, Spiritus sublevat
infirmitates nostras, quid enim oremus ut oportet non novimus, sed ipse
Spiritus intercedit pro nobis suspiriis inenarrabilibus; qui vero scrutatur
corda, novit quid sapiat Spiritus, quia secundum Deum intercedit pro sanctis,
Romans 8.26, 27.

Ut omnes Spiritum Sanctum in cordibus, quo pro seipsis and omnibus aliis Deum
rite orent, percipiant, and Dominum sum^^is prosequantur laudibus pro omni sua
erga se bonitate, quae ^n saecula est, exoptat mihi animus sincerus.

Apostolus, dixit Deus, arcana sua nobis per Spiritum retexit, Spiritus enim
omnia scrutatur, etiam profunditates Dei, 1 Cor. 2.10. Ab eodem quoque Apostolo
dictum est: Justitia Dei per illud revelatur ex fide in fidem, Romans 1.17. Huc
pertinet and illud: Notum vobis facio fratres, Evangelium quod est a me
Evangelizatum, non esse secundum hominem, neque enim ego ab homine id accepi,
neque edoctus sum, sed per revelationem Jesu Christi, Gal. 1.11, 12. Quod hinc
quaerendum venit est hoc: Number quis Justitiam Dei, fidem Christi, Profunditates
Dei, and Evangelium Christi, nisi Spiritu Dei, haec sibi ut olim, diebus nempe
Apostolorum retegantur, praedicare rite valeat? Apostolus dixit: Quando vero
libuit Deo qui separavit me ab utero Matris meae, and vocavit per gratiam suam,
revelare Filium suum, in me ut Evangelizarem ipsum in Gentes, Gal. 1.15, 16.
Christus similiter dicit, nemo novit Filium nisi Pater, neque Patrem quisquam
novit nisi Filius, and cuicunque voluerit Filius ipsum retegere, Matt. 11.27.
An igitur quisquam verus Filii aut Patris Minister aut Praeco esse potest
absque Revelatione Divina? nam Christus aperte asserit, neminem Patrem aut
Filium nisi Spiritu revelante dignoscere posse: Hinc seqitur, neminem nec Deum
nec Christum absque Spiritus Divini revelatione Patrem and Filium retegente
praedicare posse, quam quidem revelationem hominum millia sibi patefactam ad
Dei perpetuum honorem testantur; qui and gratis Patrem Praedicant, qui in luce
illius sicut ipse est in luce ambulant, communitatem cum Patre and Filio and
seinvicem mutuam obtinentes, ob quam Gratiae immortales Deo in saecula
saeculorum hoc nomine debentur and exhibentur.

Testimonium Scripturis consonum, Persecutioni vero Religionis causa maxim
contrarium. Sive consilium de abrogandis legibus Conscientiam teneram Dei,
Proerogativam, constringentibus Christianis propositum and oblatum.
HAMANVS Judaeos stirpitus evellere cupiens, eo quod Cultus eorum Religiosus
Ahasuero Regi contrarius esse videretur, ipse de medio fuit sublatus, hac
pronunciata Sententia Regi in rem non esse ut viverent: Regi vero aliter visum
erat, qui ipsis vitam permisit quod in rem suam cedere liquido cerneret.

Christus increpatis de Coelo ignem advocantibuts ad illos perdendos qui
Christum accipere nolebant, dixit, nescitis cujusnam Spiritus estis: An igitur
Spiritum suum percipiebant qui jam inde ab Apostolorum diebus necandis
hominibus Religionis causa incumbebant, qui non solum ignem de Coelo ad alios
perimendos sunt comprecati, verum etiam rogos in Terris construendos ob id
ipsum curarunt. Annon qui talia perpetrant majore increpatione sunt digni
utpote animis magis coeci quam qui ignem de Coelo advocabant ad illos cremando,
qui Christum recipere nolebant? Legimus Christum flagello e funiculis facto
Emptores and Venditores ex Templo Dei ejecisse, nunquam vero ad intrandum
adegisse: Christus quoque dixit sinite Zizania and triticum una crescere usque
ad messem, qui finis Mundi est, ne triticum eradicetur, and in fine Mundi
Christus Angelos suos, Messores emittet, annon Angeli Spiritus sunt and non
homines? Christus Petrum, Gladium in vaginam recondere jussit, addens, omnes
qui Gladio usi fuerint, Gladio peribunt.

An vero postea Petrus aut Apostolorum quisquam, stricto Gladio Carnali aut
armis Carnalibus, quibus Ecclesiam Christi, Cultum religiosum aut fidem
defenderent, usi sunt? Contra vero Petrus Christi jussu gladium recondidit and
Christus auriculam servi Pontificis amputatam sanavit, quod Evangelium salutare
aperte designabat. Apostoli dicebant, Arma nostrae militiae non sunt carnalia,
sed spiritualia, and quod nec adversus carnem nec sanguinem luctemur. Annon
omnes Christiani (nomine tenus) ab Apostolorum diebus Ecclesias, Cultum
rations, armis Carnalibus utentes, adversus Carnem and Sanguinem colluctati
sunt? Annon arma militiaque eorum Carnalia, non vero spiritualia, cujusmodi
arma Apostolorum, Ecclesiaeque Christi Primaevae, fuere? Qui igitur gladium quo
Cultuuum rations fideique formulas defendant, eduxerunt, non eodem quo
Apostoli spiritu praediti fuerunt, Apollyonis vero spiritum sapiebant.

Annon qui hanc Scripturam producebant ad Persecutionem religionis causa
protegendam eadem abusi sunt, quae sic se habet, omnis anima Potestatibus
supereminentibus subjecta esto; proinde subjecti estote cuivis humanae
ordinationi propter Dominum ad ultionem facinorosorum destinatae, hos etlam
facinorosos nominat nempe Homicidas, Patricidas, Matricidas, Perfidiosos, etc.
non tamen dicit, omnis anima Potestatibus supereminentibus, and cuivis humanae
ordinationi subjecta esto, ut inde occasio arripiatur homines Religionis causa
morte mulctandi, quod hujus vel illius Coetus religiosi communitate non
utantur. Si enim Apostolus ita sensisset: Cur, ipse Judaeorum Caesarisque
Romani Imperatoris Religioni, ut and Dianae Ephesinae semet non submisit?
Apostolus Ecclesiae Christi dicit diserte non esse tangendas aut gustandas
Doctrinas, praescripta and ordinationes hamanas; tantum absuerunt Christiani ut
sese iis aut Ethnicis subjicerent, cum in mandatis haberent talia non esse
tangenda aut gustanda, quae omnia ipso usu sunt corrumpenda: Legimus in
Apocalipsi Johannis Bestiam Draconis Potentia stipatam fuisse, qui omnibus in
unum a summo ad infimum vi compulsis Ipsum, ipsiusque imaginem receptam, suam
and Religionem colere adegit, Bestiam vere ibidem in lacum igne ardentem
detrusam fuisse, non minus observare licet.

Johannes ibidem testatur sanguinem Prophetarum, and Jesu martyrum inventum
fuisse in Babylone Mysterio, Scortationum Ecclesiaeque Adulterinae Matre
sanctorum Sanguine, and Martyrum Jesu inebriata, incolas Terrae suae
scortationis vino infatuante, ebrios fuisse; unde tanta in sanctos rabies
Martyresque Jesu promanavit, quem vero exitum sortita sit Meretrix illa ab
eodem Johanne-literis proditum est.

Durantibus december Persecutionibus, legimus quantum Christianis excidium ab
Ethnicis Regibus and Imperatoribus sit illatum, eo quod religioso eorum cultui
sese adjungere aut conformes esse negarent. Annon plurimi interest
Christianorum, ut se positis armis Carnalibus, Gladiisque materialibus in
vaginas reconditis quibus Cultus religiosi ab interitu, sed frustra hactenus,
vindicarunt, and armis spiritualibus quibus Apostoli usi sunt, uti? nec esse
immemores Veteris Caini in Exemplum propositi, qui errabundus factus, fide vera
posthabita Abelem justum occidebat; nec minus Ishmael memoria est removendus,
qui sobolis legitimae insectator fuit Lethalis: Apostolus testatur, qui ex
Carne natus est, ex spiritu natum persecutus est, ita and nunc est; Nusquam
vero legimus quemquam, secundum Spiritum natum alios persecutum esse: Christi
Consilium fuit: Inimicos diligite; mutuum amorem colite: Hinc innotescet vos
esse Discipulos meos; qui enim Christianitatem profitentur, debent praecepta
Christi observare: Nebuchadonozor, Praeconem clamare jussit, ut si quis
imaginem a se erectam incurvatus non colat, in fornacem igne ardentem
conjicitor: Deus vero frustrato hominis proposito Populum suum incolumem
servavit: Dominus deinde and palam fecit Altissimum in regnis hominum regnare.
Nullus dehinc praeco inter Christianos sub poena concremationis, suspendii,
Incarcerationis, bonorum abripiendorum proclamet recusantibus sese incurvare,
aut abnegantibus Ideam Religionis a sua alienam adorare: Haec enim non potest
esse Religio vera, quia Christus nihil tale uspiam praecepit, qui Discipulos ad
Evangeliz^ndum omnibus Gentibus emisit, sed non sub poena Concremationis,
suspendii, Patibuli, incarcerationis, aut honorum abripiendorum eis denunciata,
qui id aut ipsos recipere respuebant. Pulvis vero Pedum eorum die novissimo
firmum ad id evincendum Testimonium esse voluit.

Pharaoh cum exercitu suo ingenti Persecutor, liberorumque Enecator Crudelis
fuit, quem vero finem ille cum exercitu habuerit, palam est; Annon in mare
divinitus immisso sui Populi suspiriis a Jehovah auditis, peribat?

Nec minus atrox Domini cultorum Persecutor fuit Herodes, qui infantulos
necandos curavit, nec defuit voluntas Christum ipsum mortis supplicio
afficiendi; Deus vero ipsum ex ipsius manu eruit: Tempus nunc postulat ut
seposita Religionis causa Persecutione, utpote Dei voluntate contraria Apostolo
dictanti auscultemus, qui ad hunc modum loquitur: Qui fratrem odio prosequitur,
homicida est, nec habet vitam aeternam in se manentem, qui vero in Charitate
habitat in Deo habitat, nam Deus Charitas est. Davidi olim Templum externum
aedificare nefas fuit, quod sanguinem in bellis externis sub veteri foedere
effudisset: Quomodo ergo vos spiritus pacifici ductum ignorantes, quorum opera
tot caedes personarum, violationes bonorum Religionis causa, direptiones
perpetratae fuere, Templum spirituale sub novo foedere condere potestis? Zion
sub veteri pacto sanguinis dispendio non erat construenda; an igitur versimile
est, Hierosolimam Coelestem sub novo foedere a Christianis, ita dictis
sanguinis effusione, Persecutione, Carceratione, bonorum abreptionibus
aedificatum iri, quum Christus ipse palam eis testatus est, qui ignem de Coelo
ad homines necandos advocabant: Nescitis inquit quem Spiritum sapiatis. Quo
pacto igitur dignoscere potestis quem spiritum vos sapiatis, qui occiditis, ad
necem in carceribus, bonis abripiendis, idque de rebus fidei, Ecclesiae and
Cultus religiosi insectati estis atrociter?

Quam igitur periculosum est illis, vel corporum nedum animarum curam
concredere, qui quem spiritum sapiant, ignorant. Jesus Christus turbam
saepissime allocutus est, qui aures habet ad audiendum, audiat; neminem vero
auditu Orbatum, nec illos qui aures obdurabant, ne audiant, nec Oculos
praecludentes, ne videant and convertantur, persecutus est; nec ullum a Cultu
suo religioso, aut Religione abhorrentem, in Carcerem detrusit: aut quod cultui
ab ipso instituto minime conformes essent, bona abripienda praecepit: Saepius
vero dixit, qui aurem habet, audiat, and ita auribus ipsos commendabat:
Johannes in Apocalypsi septem Ecclesiis dicit, qui aurem habet, audiat quid
Spiritus dicat Ecclesiis, non vero dicit, qui aurem non habet, ad audiendum,
quid Spiritus dicat Ecclesiis, aut conformis esse respuerit; in Carcerem
conjicitor, bona istiusmodi hominis abriniantur, vel in exilium mittatur; neque
enim Christus, neque ab illo Apostoli, nihil tale uspiam praeceperunt: Christi
mandatum sic se habet: Vosmet mutuo amore prosequimini: inimicos diligite, qui
enim in amore habitat in Deo habitat, and qui fratrem odit est homicida, nullus
vero homicida vitam habet aeternam in se manentem: Johannes itidem in
Apocalypsi dicit Bestiam fuisse Draconis potentia munitam, qui omnes a minimis
ad maximos ad se imaginemque suam colendum adegisse: Annon ibidem legere licet
Bestiam, Draconem, eorumque Asseclas and Cultores in Lacum flagrantem
deturbatos fuisse? Annon igitur magni interest Christianorum ut Apostolorum
armis spiritualibus, sibi assumptis, quibus solummodo fides, Ecclesia and
Cultus Divinus propagatur, and resipiscant, and ad frugem meliorem sese
recipiant?

FINIS.
