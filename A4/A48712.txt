THE LITANY OF The D. of B.
FRom a Sensual, Proud, Atheistical Life,
From Arming our Lacqueys with Pistol and Knife,
From Murdering the Husband and Whoring the Wife:
Libera nos.
From going Ambassadors only as Panders,
From Re-killing dead Kings with Monstrous Slanders,
From Betraying the Living in Scotland and Flanders:
Libera nos.
From a Wild Rambling nowhere Abode,
Without Day or Night, nor at Home nor Abroad,
From a Prince to Unhorse us on Dover Road:
Libera nos.
From Crowning the Hearse of our Babe of Adultery,
Interred among Kings by a Lord of the Prelacy,
Whom we got Cashiered for Carnal Arsery:
Libera nos.
From Selling Land twice, ten thousand a year
All Spent, no Mortal can tell how, or where,
And then Reform Kingdoms as a Sanctified Peer:
Libe^^ nos.
From Monstrous Sucking, till both Tongues have Blisters,
From making our Boasts of giving three Glisters,
By giving our Claps to three cheated Sisters:
Libera nos.
From Transposing Nature upon our Bon -- Gers,
On Keniston Acting both Venus and Mars,
From owning twenty other men's Farce:
Libera nos.
From Wretched Pasquills against Shadwel and Dryden,
From Casting Nativities with Learned Heyden,
And Casting of Dollars at Antwerp and Leyden:
Libera nos.
From Trembling at Sea, when not a Gun Roared,
And then Steal Ashore by Breaking our Word.
With Dam me if e're you Catch me Aboard:
Libera nos.
From being still Cheated by the same Undertakers,
By Levellers, Bawds, Saints, Chemists and Quakers,
Who make us Gold-Finders, and themselves Gold Makers:
Libera nos.
From Dam me, whatever we don't Understand,
From Purchasing at Dowgate, and Selling in the Strand,
Calling Streets by our Name, when we have Sold the Land
Libera nos.
From Borrowing our own House to Treat Scholars Ill,
And then be Unchancellor'd against our Will,
Naught left of a College but our own Colledge-hill:
Libera nos.
From Judging the Judges in a Senseless Speech,
From Following S --, that Riggling Leech,
Because by Twins both Sucked the same Bitch:
Libera nos.
From Mortally Hating all those that Love us,
From Mimical Acting all those Above us,
Till our Master at last is forced to Remove us
Libera (...)
From Cringing to those we Scorn to Condemn,
In hopes to be made the Citizens Gem,
Who now Scorn us more than e're we did them:
Libera nos.
From Sneaking 'twixt Castle-yard and Vandeput,
From Telling Tales when we have been at Rutt,
And Ramming three Candles into one Ladies Scut:
Libera nos.
From beginning an Execrable Traitarous Health,
To Destroy this Parliament, King and Himself,
To be made Ducall Peer of a New Commonwealth:
Libera nos.
From Changing Old Friends for Rascally New ones,
From taking Wildman and Marvil for True Ones,
From Wearing Green Ribbons against him gave Blew ones:
Libera nos.
From Lodging at Court before we are Sent for, Sion-hill

From Selling six Palaces for less than they Rent-for, College-(...)

And Buying three Hillocks for the three Kings of Branford: Cliptdon-^

Libera nos.
From Learning new Morals from Bedlam, Sir Peyton,
O^ Truth and Modesty from Ellis Leyton,
From making our Heirs to be Morris and Clayton:
Libera nos.
