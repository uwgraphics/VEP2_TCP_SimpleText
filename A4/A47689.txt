The Speakers Letter of the House of Commons to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty, February the 12. 1641.
SIR,
BEsides my sorrows (which pressed me very sore, and remains still upon me)
the troubles and grief that fell upon me for the lamentable breaches in Church
and State, and for your Sacred Majesty and hopeful offspring, filled up my
sorrows, and in my thoughts J was grieved that those fears and Desolations
fell out in your days, I confess, charity suspects not, and the best minds
thinks the least hurt, and the freer a man is, from vice in himself, the more
charitable he is of others, and this is that which has proved (formerly
prejudicial to your Majesty, but had your Majesty been the first, or the best,
that had bin instead, misinformed, or ill rewarded it would be an hard thing to
command patience, but grief is assuaged either by presiden^s, or examples. It
is true of late days your Majesty being misinformed against some of your best
subjects, your Majesty thought to have dealt with them, as Joseph thought to
have dealt with Marie, and so put them away far from you, but with Marie they
travailing as it were with child, and that that which they travailed withal
might not appear an illegitimate the only wise God, sent as it were an Angel
unto you, to let you see, that like Marie they being contracted unto you in
love, they have not as yet defiled their Marriage Bed, but remain like Marie
faithful to their Head and Sovereign, and your Majesty having been formerly
seduced by false opinions from others against them, J hope you will now be
reduced unto them (and by them) by true persuasions, and that you may be so the
only wise God that gave your Majesty your being, and so knew you better then
your self, has dealt with your Majesty, as he did with Adam in Paradise, and
so has provided you a meet helper, when with Adam you thought no need of it,
now desired it, and your Majesty yielding as Adam did, (in sparing a
superfluous Rib for to make him a meet helper) will become a great gainer, for
your Majesty shall not only loose those who may very well be spared, but you
will gain to your self and your posterity a meet helper, that will endeavor
by all means that may be Lawful to ease you of many burdens that otherwise
might have layne heavy upon you, and this helper is many members of that body,
whereof your Majesty is become the head* and considering their pains and
labor in Love, you should do them injustice if you should suffer any for to
accuse them, J hope there is none (or will be none) near you (if near you,
yet dares not) so ingrosse your favors any more to their own advantage
whereby your good Subject^ may be bereaved of those Benefits that ought to be
common to all, as for your Commons, they go not about to steal your favors,
but to purchase them them legally, and are become unto you as Abraham's Servant
was to his Master, who would not either Eat, or Drink, until he had done his
Masters business, and I dare say if your Commons (as your late Monopolists, and
others) had or did seek themselves, or their own advantages, (more then the
good of King and Kingdom) they would have been wearied after so much labor
before now, but me thinks J hear your Commons say as Adam said, let us be
but one, and that it may be so, they are willing, not only for a time to be
separated from their Domesticke employments, but to forsake all, and run many
hazards, to cleave only to your Majesty in a solemn Contract, wherefore to
make up the contract, you must with Isaacke part with something that was
formerly near unto you, and who would no^ spare a part, to save the rest,
being done it will prove to your Majesty as comfortable and welcome, as Rebecca
was into Isaacks Tent.

This happy match being made, it would not only refresh your people, but make
glad your heart in time of fears and dangers, it is true, there is many that
have brought your Majesty into troubles, and feared dangers (and the more too
blame they, for leaving your Majesty, having brought you into them) it is true,
there are many with Orpha, seeing your troubles, have left you, but your
Commons like Ruth are resolved to stick close unto you, and will endeavor to
help you, if with David you will be advised by them (who blessed God for the
seasonable Council of a woman, when he was upon a desperate design) judge
then of their loves and affections to your Majesty, by yours to them; and then
tell me, whether they do not love you* doubtless, yes; accounting their lives
not dear unto them, so that they may but finish their work with ^oy* and
accomplish their good ends concerning you, and I doubt not, but that J speak
it in the name of many and in truth by your late yielding and free expression;
you have stolen me from my self, yea, and am now wounded within me, and like
Moses, who was wounded within himself, and could hardly endure to look upon
God (...) he descended in mercy. It is true, there is nothing engages a soul
to God, or a Subject to a King, as the appearance of love, this made Moses to
say: How dreadful is thy place O God, and this is that which has stolen me
from my self, so that J am no more mine own, but yours; yea, by this return
of yours to your people, you will win them to obedience with kindness, and
by doing so; you will make good that which you were sent for, whose ears ought
to be employed for the good of your Subjects; knowing that their love is your
greatest safety, and their prosperity your greatest honor and ^elicity; and
this is that which will make your bed easy; when you shall possess the just
Title to the Crown with the love of your people, and the continuance of it
with the willing applause of the Subject, is the ^ighest way to a blessing, and
the hopes of this is that which has brought me to renew and confirm the
Covenant that your Majesty made with me from your first entrance to the Crown,
and because you could not swear by no greater, swore by the eternal God, that
you would defend me, and at the first of our contract we made but one, your
power and all that you had was mine to defend me, and to do me good, but there
have bin some of late, that have set your Majesty against me. (J speak it in
the name of many) and have persuaded you to beat me, and to force me to
obedience, though of my self willing to obey, being of a nature sooner won,
then compelled, and this is that which has sore troubled me, yet this is not
all, but when an Oath, (with an et Coetera) was put upon me, it wounded me* for
by the Oath that I had taken already* I was bound fast enough, but the truth is
when these things befell me, J was afraid that some evil minded men like to
Potiphers wife, seeing mine Innocence, and more faithful to you* my Husband,
then themselves, had complained against me without cause, and this I could
hardly bear, for by this means our great adversaries, the Divill and Pope,
labored to sow contentions, and jealousies between us and this is that which
will be a means to undo us both when your Majesty (which is become my head,
and husband) speaks kindly unto me, and is ruled by those that love us both my
heart is inflamed, with a love unto you, but when your Ministers abuse yo^^
^ajesties kindness, and become tirants to their fellow Ser^^nts, yea when they
shall go about to Justify themselves, and lay all their villainy upon your
Majesty, this J can hardly bear, for by this means J am deprived of my
marriage bed, and of my wonted society, and am troubled within my self, when I
see your Majesty (which is become my head and husband) strange unto me, but I
hope every former breach will unite love the stronger wher^fore being now
reconciled to your Commons, Feast, Live Love, and dye together, and be more
firm in your near union, then ever divided in your hearty unkindnesse, so
shall you meet in the end and never Part, but be like Rachell and Leah, which
two* built up the house of Israel, you are now in the way, and it is said*
Genesis 24, 27. That whilst the Servant of Abraham was in the way, God blessed
him, the same God bless you, and for your comfort, and encouragement* know, by
so much shall you grow to perfection, by how much you draw near to unity, I
confess had the Balaacs and Baalams of our times been so evil as they would
have been, the world had been overrunne with evil, but such is the wisdom
of God, that ofttimes he hides from evil men those times and seasons, that
might prove prejudicial to his people, so when Saul sought for David, it is
true the good God might have destroyed the Baalams and wicked Saul's of our
times, but many times he will not, for God has something more for them to do,
and it is not so much glory to God to take away wicked men, as to use their
evil to his own holy purposes, and gains many times more glory by working
good by evil Instruments, then by destroying of them presently in their wicked
purposes, for it is a true Maxim, that it suffices a good man* that here
resists the evil actions of the wicked, whilst they love their persons. J
confess, our Balaams and our Saul's, had gone very far, but in some things
God permits in indignation, not for that he gives leave to the Act, but that
he gives a man over to the sin in the Act, and yet this sufferance imployes
not favor but judgment, and God is contented the Devil should win himself
credit (sometimes) where he means to judge, I confess our Saul's and our
Baalams like Cisera, trusted in their strength, but like Cisera many of them
run away, yet in spite of them all, the Lord has made a seasonable and
hopeful provision for his people. It is too true by the means of our Saul's,
your Majesty became to your people and Commons, as the Angel was unto Gydeon,
and so made them affrayd, but like the Angel that made Gydeon affrayd, your
Majesty has returned to their comfort, and as God he uses, where he loves* he
imployes, and like Christ himself you are now willing to enjoy them b^ a
willing contract, and not by (...), and by this means you appear now unto
your people like Moses, who had more glory by his Vale, then by his face, and I
do no^ doubt but when all things shall be made manifest, but that one
faithful DAVID will be in more (...) with your Majesty; then either the Saul's
or Baalams (...) is true, by the means of our Saul's the Crown (...) become
full of cares, and your Majesty (...) almost been wearied by them, would feign
now take some rest, and that your Majesty may rest, J will with Jacob give God
no rest until he have blessed you, wherefore being now reconciled unto your
Commons, you will become as sweet and pleasant to the Church, and the three
Kingdoms, as the Tree that God showed to Moses, which when he cast into the
waters, the waters were made sweet (which formerly were bitter) J know that
thankfulness and love, can do more with good men, then merit or necessity,
and me thinks I see you like our Savior who thirsted after the salvation of
Mankind, and J believe it was not so much out of dryness as out of love, go
you and do so likewise, knowing that modest beginnings, and hopeful
proceedings makes happy endings, and for your comfort know, that God whose
Battles you fight, will provide a due reward, and so J commend the saying of
Solomon unto you, Eccles. 9.10. Whatsoever thy hand finds to do, do it with
thy might, for there is no work nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom in the
grave whither thou go.

FINIS.
