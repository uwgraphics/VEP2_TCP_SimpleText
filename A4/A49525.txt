A Warning-piece for all Wicked Livers: OR, A Cavat for all People to remember
their Latter End.
Being very good Instructions for Old and Young, rich and poor, to amend their
lives, and repent before it be too late.

To the Tune of, The rich Merchant Man.


TO you both Old and Young,
these Lines I do indite,
Desiring you them to observe,
and not good Counsel slight:
Take notice well I pray,
what is here penned in this Song,
Unto the General Iudgement-Day,
I think the time's not long:
Then fear God and Repent,
spend not your time in waste,
For old and young, both rich and poor,
must yield to Death at last.
HOw many wicked Sins,
are Reigning in our Land?
Which are by men and women used
against the Lords command:
Hateful Pride is in use,
and also Blasphemy,
Many run on in wickedness,
and think they never shall dye:
Then fear, etc.
O Would men did but think
upon their latter end,
Then they would fly all vanity,
and strive their lives to mend:
O Wretched Mortal Man,
keep still, and bear in mind,
Though thou take pleasure in this Life,
yet thou wilt leave them behind:
Then fear, etc.
MInd not this Worldly Wealth,
on it set not thy heart,
For when that death does stop thy breath,
thy Gold and thee must part,
Man's Life is like a Flower,
that grows fresh and brave,
We are here to day, to morrow we may
be laid within our Grave:
Then fear, etc.
ABhor and also shun,
from Drunkenness always.
'Twill bring thy Soul and body both
to ruin and decay:
Abomination it is,
before the sight of God,
Then use it not, lest that he scourge
thee with his heavy Rod:
Then fear, etc.
SWear thou not by the Lord,
take not his name in Uain,
In Moses Law it is forbid,
as Scripture shows it plain:
Some men now in these days,
will upon their Sins boast,
He is counted the bravest Blade
that can curse and swear most:
Then fear God and Repent,
spend not your time in waste,
For old and young, both rich and poor,
must yield to Death at last.


LEt not thy mind be bent,
to do thy Neighbor wrong,
But see thou give all men their due
which does to them belong:
Pray Love the Fatherless,
to the Widow be a Friend,
Relieve those that are in distress,
then God will thee defend:
Then fear God and Repent,
spend not your time in waste,
For old and young, both rich and poor,
must yield to Death at last.
A Covetous mind don't bear,
if thou art blessed with store,
But spare some part of what thou have,
for the help of the poor:
Although that wealth thou have,
yet it is but lent to thee,
Then comfort and give alms to those
that are in misery.
Then fear, etc.
NOw to Young people likewise,
good counsel I will give,
If thou wilt it take, 'twill do thee good,
so long as thou do live?
Neglect not Gods Holy Word,
but keep his Laws truly,
Mind not the pleasure of this world,
for it is but Vanity.
Then fear, etc.
FOrget not you this rule,
bear it in mind always,
Unto your Parents reverence give,
and duly them obey:
For those Children that do;
their Father and Mother scorn,
The curse of God hangs on their head,
better they would never been born:
Then fear, etc.
IDleness and Sloth shun,
labor as God al^ows;
Strive always for (...)
by the sweat of none (...)
Endeavor and get in Youth,
to keep you when you are old
For if Poverty does come you will find,
that Charity will be cold,
Then fear, etc.
REfuse no good counsel
that is given unto thee;
But show respect unto all men,
and not high-minded be:
Remember that thou keep,
the Sabbath of the Lord,
For that is a day ordained for us,
to meditate on his Word:
Then fear, etc.
EVery one that does
these Verses hear or see
Example take, and learn by them,
for to live righteously:
Enter not into Sin,
repent without delay;
For time and tide does slip along,
it will for no man stay:
Then fear God and repent,
spend not your time in waste,
For old and young, both rich and poor
must yield to Death at last.
FINIS.
