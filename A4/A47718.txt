THE THIRD PART OF THE REPORTS Of Several Excellent CASES OF LAW, Argued and
Adjudged in the COURTS of LAW AT WESTMINSTER.

In the Time of the late QUEEN ELIZABETH; From the First, to the Five and
Thirtieth Year of her Reign.

Collected by a Learned Professor of the LAW, WILLIAM LEONARD, Esquire; Then of
the Honorable Society of GRAY'S INN: Not before Imprinted; And now Published By
William Hughes of Gray's Inn, Esquire

With Alphabetical TABLES of the Names of the CASES, and of the Matters
contained in the BOOK.

LONDON, Printed by the Assigns of Richard and Edward Atkins Esquires; For
Henry Twyford, Thomas Basset, William Rawlins, and John Place. 1686.

TO THE READER.
Courteous Reader,
I Can do no less than acquaint thee, That the First and Second Part of the
REPORTS of that Learned Lawyer, William Leonard, of Gray's Inn, Esquire, were
obtained from me, and Printed by the over-forwardness of those persons that
received it from my hand, who published it with a Design to prejudice the
Learned Author and my self, by false Intimating in the Epistle to the Reader
prefixed before the Second Part, That the First and Second Part, was [All] of
our Learned Authors Works, [that I thought fit to publish.] That I may
Extricate my self out of their intended Abuse, and undeceive thee, I do hereby
assure thee, That although I do Collect the First and Second Part, yet do I
wholly disown the Epistle aforementioned, and also aver it to be a false and
scandalous Assertion. That it is so, I refer thee to the View of this Third
Part, The which is in no wise Inferior to the First and Second Part: But on the
contrary, I may with Modesty say, as to the Worth and Usefulness of it, That it
may Challenge the Precedence of the Other Two; the which I intended, as one
that Feasteth his Guests, preserves the Daintiest Dishes until the last.

My Intention ever was, (if my other occasions would give me leave) To publish
such further CASES as were Collected by him, (not before Imprinted) that might
add something to the Study and Benefit of the Ingenuous Reader: Wherefore I
having lately Collected (out of his Manuscript which only is in my hands) some
other Cases (out of many) which lay scattering therein, not before made
Public, I have reduced them into this Third Part, which I commend to thy
Reading, and leave to thy favorable Construction. And if these Cases now
Printed off in this Third Part, (as the former Cases have done) shall find good
Acceptance of thee, and be useful to thee, I shall willingly (if God give me
life, and it be desired,) put an End to this Work. In the prosecution of the
which, I shall have due regard, as I hitherto have had in this Third Part, as
well as in the Two former Parts, that thou shall be presented with nothihg but
what is Really useful, and not to be had in other Works of the like nature.

Now for as much as no Action or Thing done under Heaven, can be free from
Error, in a greater or lesser proportion, The which, as well as other Arts,
Printing too too frequently demonstrateth; yet the Errors of this Third Part
are so few, and Inconsiderable, that it makes me the more Confident to desire
thy favorable Corection: Therefore I leave it to thee.

From my Study in Gray's Inn, 24 of October, 1662. William Huhges.

THE THIRD PART OF THE REPORTS OF Several Excellent Cases, Argued and Adjudged
in the several COURTS of LAW at Westminster. In the Time of the Late Queen
ELIZ. From the First, to the Five and Thirtieth Year of her Reign.
In the Time of Edw. the Sixth.
I. 6 Edw. 6. In the Common Pleas.
A Man had a Warrren in Fee extending into three Towns, Benlow's Rep. 12. Owen
Rep. 10. 1 And. 26. 13 Co. 57. 1 Inst. 148. a. 7 Co. 23. b. Goldb. 44.
and Leased the same by Deed to another, rendering Rent; And afterward granted
by Deed the Reversion of the whole Warren in one of the said Towns to another,
and the Lessee attorned; It was holden by all the Justices in the Common Pleas,
That neither the Grantor, nor the Grantee, should have any part of the Rent
during the same Term, Because no such Contract can be apportioned.

II. 6 Edw. 6. In the Common Pleas.
A Man by Deed Indented, 1 And. 27.
Bargained and sold Land unto another in Fee; and Covenanted by the same Deed,
to make to him a good and sufficient Estate in the said Land before Christmas
next; And afterward before Christmas, the Bargainor acknowledged the Deed, and
the same is enrolled: It was the Opinion of all the Justices of the Common
Pleas, That by that Act, the Covenant aforesaid was not performed: For the
Bargainor in performance of the same, ought to have levied a Fine, made a
Feoffment, or done other such Acts.

III. 6 Edw. 6. In the Common Pleas.
1 And. 32.
IN Dower, the Tenant made default at the Summons; and now at the Grand Cape, he
came and said, That he could not come, because he was in great infirmity at the
time of the Summons, so as he could not appear. It was the Opinion of the whole
Court, That that matter should not save his Default, because it cannot be
tried, as creit de Eve, and Imprisonment may be.

IV. 6 Edw. 6. In the Common Pleas.
1 And. 32.
DEbt against Executors, who pleaded, Riens enter Maynes; which was found
against them. The Plaintiff sued forth a Writ of Execution: Upon which the
Sheriff returned, Nulla bona Testatoris, within the County: It was the Opinion
of the Court, That the same was a good Retorn, for it may stand with the
Verdict; for it may be that they have Assets in another County. See 3 H. 6. 11.
Where the Retorn is general, Quod non habent Executores aliqua bona Testatoris,
that it was holden insufficient, but here in this Case the Retorn is special;
scil. in the same County.

In the Time of Queen Mary.
V. 1 and 2 Philip and Mary. In the Common Pleas.
1 And. 31.
TEnant in tail had Issue two Sons, and enfeoffed his younger Son, and died: The
younger Son died without Issue, leaving his Wife priviment ensient with a Son;
the elder Brother entered: It was holden in this Case, That he was Remitted; and
although that afterward the Son was born; yet the same should not avoid the
Remitter.

VI. Stapleton and Truelocks Case. Mich. 1 and 2 Phil. and Mary.
More Rep. 11.
WIlliam Stapleton, Executor of John Scardenyll, brought an Action of Debt
against John Truelock, Administrator of the Goods of William Truelock, who died
Intestate, upon a Bill sealed. The Defendant demanded Oyer of the Testament: By
which it appeared, That the said Scardenyll had made the Plaintiff, and the
said William Truelock his Executors: And in the said Will was this Clause; I
Will, That my Friend William Truelock shall pay to my other Executor all such
debts as he owes me, before he shall meddle with any thing of this my Will, or
take any Advantage of this my Will for the discharge of the same debts, for
that I have made him one of my Executors. And upon this matter, It was clearly
Resolved, that the said William Truelock could not Adminster, nor be Executor
before he had paid the debts. And the Defendant said, That the said William
Truelock in his life had paid unto his Co-Executors all such debts which in
vita sua debuit to the said Scardenyll; And also, that the said William
Truelock in his life time had Administered the Goods of Scardenyll, with his
Co-Executors. And in this Case, Judgment was given for the Plaintiff, and that
for default of pleading: For the Defendant ought to have showed Acquittances of
the payment of the debts to his Co-Executors; and also ought to have showed in
Certainty, what debts they were.

VII. Hecks and Tirrell's Case. 3 and 4 Phil. and Mary.
DEbt by Hecks and Harrison against Tirrell as Heir; Who pleaded, Nothing by
Descent. The Plaintiff Replied, 1 And. 28.
Assets at such a place within the Cinque Ports. And so it was found by a Jury
of the County adjoining, and Judgment given of the moiety of his Lands, as well
those by descent, as by purchase: And a Writ awarded to the Constable of Dover,
to extend the Lands within the Cinque Ports. But it was said, That first the
Plaintiff ought to have a Certiorari to send the Record into the Chancery, and
from thence by Mittimus to the Constable of Dover.

VIII. The King and Due and Kirleys Case. 4 and 5 Phil. and Mary.
THe King and Queen brought a Writ of Disceit against Due and Kirley; and
declared, More Rep. 13
That one Colley was seized of certain Lands in Fee, and held the same of the
King and Queen as of their Manor of Westbury; the which Manor is Ancient
Demesne: and so seized, levies a Fine thereof to the said Due, Sur Conusans de
Droit come ceo, etc. Due rendered the Land to Colley for life, the Remainder
over to Kirley in Fee: Colley died; Kirley entered as in his Remainder. Kirley
pleaded, That the Land whereof, etc. is Frank* Fee, etc. Upon which, they are
at Issue: Which Issue depending, and not tried, Due died. It was moved in this
Case, That the Writ might abate. But that was denied by the Court. For this
Action is but Trespass in its nature for to punish this Disceit; and no Land is
to be recovered, but only the Fine Reversed.

IX. Eliot and Nutcombs Case. Mich. 4 and 5 Phil. and Mary. In the Common Pleas.
1 And. 27.
THe Case was, That the Bishop of Exeter leased certain Lands in the County of
Devon for years, rendering Rent payable in Exeter aforesaid, with Clause of
Re-entry; and the Bishop of Exeter had a Palace in Exeter aforesaid: It was the
Opinion of the Justices in this Case, That the Rent ought to be demanded at the
said Palace, and not elsewhere: And if that the Lessee come to the Common Gate
of the said Palace, and there tender the Rent, it is a good tender without
more, be the Gate shut or open, notwithstanding that the Bishop be within the
Palace, and that neither he nor any of his Servants be at the Gate for to
receive it: for the Lessee is not tied to open the Gate of the Palace, if it be
shut; nor to enter into the Palace, if it be open.

X. Mich. 4 and 5 Phil. and Mary. In the Common Pleas.
COpyhold Land was surrendered to the use of the Wife for life, the remainder to
the use of the right Heirs of the Husband and Wife: The Husband entered in the
right of his Wife: It was the Opinion of the Justices in this Case, That the
remainder was executed for a Moiety presently in the Wife, and the Husband of
that was seized in the right his Wife; and, the Wife dying first, that her Heir
should have it: 1 Roll. Lane and Pannel's Case.
But if the Husband had died first, his Heir should have had one Moiety.

XI. Joscelin and Sheltons Case. Mich. 4 and 5 Phil. and Mary. In the Common
Pleas.
More Rep. 13.
IN an Action upon the Case, the Plaintiff declared, That the Defendant in
Consideration that the Son of the Plaintiff would marry the Daughter of the
Defendant, assumed and promised to pay to him 400 Marks in 7 years next
ensuing, by such portions. And upon Non Assumpsit pleaded, It was found for the
Plaintiff. It was Objected in Arrest of Judgment, That one of the said 7 years
was not incurred at the time of the Action brought, etc. and that appeared upon
the Declaration, so as the Plaintiff had not cause of Action for the whole Money
promised. And for that cause, the Writ was abated by the Court by award,
although it was after Verdict. See Br. Title, Action upon the Case, 108.

XII. 2 and 3 Phil. and Mary. In the Common Pleas.
IN an Assise against 4. they were at Issue upon Null Tenant del Franktenement
nosme en le brief. And it was found by the Assise, That two of them were
Disseisors, and two Tenants: And after Verdict, and before Judgment, one of
those who were found Tenants, died; And that was moved in Arrest of Judgment:
But it was not allowed of by the Court, Because the parties had not day in
Court to plead it. But it was said, That after Judgment given, a Writ of Error
lies.

In the Time of Queen Elizabeth.
XIII. Canons Case. 1 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
UPon an Evidence to a Jury in the Common Pleas; 1 Roll. 839.
Upon an Issue there, this Deed was given in Evidence, viz. Sciant praesentes
and futuri, Quod Ego Richardus Canon, filius and haeres Richandi Canon, Dedi,
Concessi, and hac praesenti carta mea Confirmavi Willielmo Compton Militi,
Omnia Terr. Tenementa, etc. ad usum mei praed. Richardi and Joannae uxoris meae
pro termino vitae absque impetitione Vasti, ac etiam rectorum haered. mei
praefat. Richardi, and assignatorum meorum post decessum mei praefat. Richardi
and Joannae uxoris meae; Et si contingat me praefat. Richardum obire sine exitu
de Corpore meo procreato, Tunc Volo, quod omnia dict. Terr. and Tenementa
remaneant Tho. fratri meo and rectis haeredibus de Corpore suo procreatis, and
haeredib. and assignat. eorum. And it was the Opinion of the Justices, That a
good Estate tail was by that Deed limited to the said Richard in use, after the
death of his Wife.

XIV. Holt and Ropers Case. 2 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
IN a Replevin by Holt against Roper, the Case was: J. Abbot of W. Leased to
T.M. Knight, a Close of Land in B. for 44 years, Post. 242. 243.
who thereof possessed, was attainted of misprision of Treason, and so
forfeited to the King, who seized the same: The Abbot and his Covent
surrendered, 31 H. 8. the King Leased the same to Roper for 21 years, and died:
King Ed. 6th in the fourth year of his Reign, Leased the same to one Philips,
To have and to hold, after the Term to T.M. ended, for 21 years: Roper
surrendered to Queen Mary, who Leased the same again to Roper for 30 years. In
this Case, It was adjudged, That the Lease made to Phillips, was utterly void,
for that the King was deceived in his Grant; For the Lease made to F.M. was
long time before determined by extinguishment in the Person of the King, who
had it by forfeiture upon the Attainder of T.M. and the Statute of 1 E. 6. Cap.
8. shall not help that Lease (notwithstanding the Non-recital, or Mis-recital
of Leases made before:) For here is not matter of recital, but matter of Estate
and Interest, which is not well limited for the Commencement of it, i. the
Lease to Phillips; For there is not any certainty of the Commencement of it:
For that Lease cannot begin after the Surrender of Roper, for the words of the
Limitation of the beginning of it, cannot serve to such Construction.

XV. 2 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
A Term for years is devised to A. The Executors of the Devisor entered into the
Land devised to the use of the Devisee; It was the Opinion of the Court, That
the same was a sufficient possession to the Devisee.

XVI. 3 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
TWo Coparceners were of a Reversion, the one of them granted his Interest in
it by Fine to another; It was holden in that Case, That the Conusee should have
a Quid juris clamat for a Moiety of the said Reversion.

XVII. Mich. 4 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
THe Lessor mortgaged his Reversion in Fee, to the Lessee for years, and at the
day of Mortgage for payment of the Money, he paid the Money; It was holden in
this Case, That the Lease for years was not revived, but utterly extinct.

XVIII. Mich. 4 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
J.N. Cestuy que use in tail, 14 H. 8. by Indenture between him on the one
part, and J.S. of the other part, In Consideration of a Marriage between his
Son and Heir apparent, and Joan Daughter of the said J.S. to be had, Covenanted
with the said J.S. That neither he, nor any of the Feoffees seized to his use,
have made, or hereafter shall make any Estate, Release, Grant of Rent, levy any
Fine, or do any other Encumbrance whatsoever of any of his Manors, Lands, etc.
But that all the said Manors, etc. shall immediately descend or remain to his
said Son, and the Heirs of his Body, after the decease of the said J.N. It was
the clear Opinion of all the Justices in this Case, That by the said Indenture,
No use is changed in J N. nor any use raised to the said Son and Heir; but that
it is only a bare Covenant.

XIX. Andrews and Glovers Case. Trin. 4 Eliz. Rott. 1622.
IN Trespass by Andrews against Glover, The Lady Mary Dacres being seized of
the Manor of Cowdam, by her Indenture bargained and sold to the said Andrews,
all those her Woods, More Rep. 15. Post. 29. Winch. Rep. 5.
Underwoods, and Hedge-Rowes, as have been accustomably used to be felled and
sold, standing, growing, being in, upon, and within the Manor of Cowdam, etc.
To have and to hold, etc. from the Feast of S. Michael last past, during the
natural life of the said Lady Mary: And the said Andrews for himself, his Heirs
and Assigns, does Covenant and Grant, to and with the said Lady, her Executors,
etc. to content and pay, or cause to be contented and paid to the said Lady,
her Executors, etc. yearly during the said Term, 10 l. By force of which Grant,
he cuts down all and singular the Trees, Woods, and Underwoods in the aforesaid
Manor growing at the time of the making of the Indenture aforesaid. And
afterward the said Lady by her servants, felled all the other Woods and
Underwoods growing in the same Manor, after the said felling made by the said
Andrews: Whereupon Andrews brings Trespass. And the Opinion of the Court was
clear, That after the Bargainee had once felled, that he should never after
fell in the same place where the first felling was made, by force of the said
Grant, notwithstanding the Rent yearly reserved, and notwithstanding the words
of the Grant, viz. To have and to hold, during the life of the said Dame Mary.
Wherefore the said Andrews durst not Demur, etc.

XX. 6 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
THe Case was; A. is bounden to B. in an Obligation to pay to B. 20 l. at the
Feast of our Lady, without limiting in Certain, what Lady Day, viz. the
Conception, Nativity, or Annunciation; And the Opinion of the whole Court was,
That the Deed should be construed to intend such Lady Day, which should next
happen and follow the date of the said Obligation.

XXI. Scarning and Cryers Case. Mich. 7 Eliz. In the Common Pleas. Rott. 1851.
IN a Second Deliverance by Scarning against Crier, the Defendant makes
Conusans as Bailiff to J.S. and shows, More Rep. 75
That the said J.S. and at the time of the taking, etc. was Lord of the Manor
of A. Within which Manor, there was this Custom time out of mind, etc. That
the Tenants of that Manor and other Resiants and Inhabitants within the said
Manor, or the greater part of them at the Court Baron of the said Manor, at
the Manor aforesaid holden, were used and accustomed to make Laws, and impose
Pains as well upon the Resiants and Inhabitants within that Manor, and the
Tenants of the said Manor there being; as upon every Occupier of any Tenements
within the said Manor, for good government there to be had and kept, and for
the preservation of the Corn and Grass there growing: And that the said J.S.
and all those whose Estate, etc. distringere consueverunt pro omnibus poenis
sic forisfact. and per Juratores Curiae praed. ex assensu dictor. Tenent.
Inhabitant. and residentium ibid. in forma praedict. assessis and impositis;
tam super quibuscunque tenent. Manner. praedict. aut inhabitantibus aut
residentibus infra Manner. illud, quam super occupatoribus aliquor. Tenementor.
infra idem Maner': And further said, That at a Court Baron there holden, That
Coram Sectatoribus ejusdem Curiae, by the Homage of the said Court then charged
to present, with the assent of other Tenants and Inhabitants of the said
Manor, it was Ordained and Established, That no Tenant of the Manor
aforesaid, nor any of the Resiants or Inhabitants within the said Manor, nor
any Occupier of any Tenements within the said Manor from thenceforth, should
keep his Cattle within the several Fields of that Manor by By-herds, nor
should put any of their Oxen, called Draught-Oxen, there before the Feast of
St. Peter, upon pain, Quod quilibet tenens residens, etc. should forfeit 20 s.
And further said, That the Plaintiff, at the time, etc. Occupied and had such a
Tenement within the said Manor; And that at such a Court afterward holden,
viz. such a day, It was presented, that the Plaintiff Custodivit boves suos,
called Draught-Oxen, within the several Fields by By-herds, contrary to the
Order aforesaid, by which, the penalty of 20 s. aforesaid, was forfeited,
Notwithstanding the said pain de gratia Curiae illius per quosd. A. and E.
afferratores Curiae illius ad hoc jurat. assess. and afferrat. fuit ad 6 s. 8
d. And further he said, That the place in which the taking, etc. is within the
Manor aforesaid; And that A. B. Steward of the said Manor extraxit in
scriptis extra Rotulis Curiae praed. the said pain of 6 s. 8 d. and delivered
the same to the Defendant, Bailiff of the said Manor, to Collect and Receive;
by force of which, he required the said 6 s. 8 d. of the Plaintiff, and he
refused to pay it; and so avoweth the taking, etc. And upon this Conusans of
the Defendant, the Plaintiff did Demur in Law: And Judgment was given against
the Conusans, 1. Because he pleaded, That it was presented Coram Sectatoribus,
and does not show their Names. 2. The penalty appointed by the By-Law, was 20
s. and he shows, it was abridged to 6 s. 8 d. and so the penalty demanded,
and for which the Distress was taken, is not maintained by the By-Law; and a
pain certain ought not to be altered. 3. He shows, that it was presented,
that the Plaintiff had kept his Draught-Oxen; and he ought to have alleged the
same in matter in fact, that he did keep, etc.

XXII. Dedicots Case. 7 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
DEdicot seized of certain Customary Lands, Dyer 210, 251. Hob. 285.
surrendered the same into the hands of the Lord, to the intent that the Lord
should grant the same de Novo to the same Dedicot for life, and afterward to
Jane his Wife, during the Nonage of the Son and Heir of Dedicot; and afterward
to the said Son and Heir in tail, etc. Dedicot died before any new Grant:
Afterward, the Lord granted the said Land to the Wife, during the Nonage of
the said Heir, the remainder to the Heir in tail, the Heir at that time being
but of the age of 5 years; so as the said Wife by force of the said Surrender
and Admittance, was to have the said Lands for 16 years: The Wife took another
Husband, and died; And it was the Opinion of Brown and Dyer, Justices, That the
Husband should have the Lands during the Nonage of the Enfant; Hob. Rep. 281.
for the Wife had her said Estate to her own use, and then her Husband
surviving her, should have it, and that without any admittance, for that he is
not in of any new Estate, but in the Estate of his Wife as Assignee. And it was
said by them, That if a Copyholder be for years, and makes his Executors, and
dies, that the Executors should have the Term, Co. Case of Copyholders.
and that without any Admittance: Weston, contrary in that case, as to the
Executors.

XXIII. Tindall and Cobbs Case. 7 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
WAste was brought by Tindall, Knight, against Jeoffery Cobbe Esquire; and the
Plaintiff declared of a Demise of the moiety of the Manor of Wolverton; and of
the moiety of a Wood called Wolverton-Wood. The Defendant pleaded, That Robert
Winckfield before the Waste supposed, was seized of and in tertia part
alterius Medietatis of the said Manor, and of and in tertia part alterius
Medietatis of the aforesaid Wood, and held the same insimul and pro indiviso
with the Plaintiff; and that the said Robert Winckfield, by his Deed, sold to
the Defendant omnes and omnimodas arbores and subboscos suos crescent. in
praedict. tertia part alterius medietatis praedicti bosci ad libitum ipsius
Galfridi succidend. and so justified the cutting down of 300 Oaks, in which the
Waste is assigned; with this, that he will aver, That the aforesaid 300 Oaks
were the third part only in numero and precio medietatis omnium arbor. and
subboscorum at the said time when the Waste is supposed to be done; and
demanded Judgment, if Action: And diverse Exceptions were taken to the Count: 1.
He shows, Vaugh. Rep. 175.
that the Demise of the moiety of the Manor was per nomen, etc. and does not
show, that the demise was by writing; and if not, then he cannot plead it by a
per Nomen. 2. The Waste is assigned in digging of Clay in 100 Acres of Lands,
parcel Medietatis Manner. de Wolverton, and has not showed in what Town the
Land is: For he has showed before, the Demise of the moiety of the Manor of
Wolverton in Wolverton. 3. He shows the Demise of the moiety of the Manor of
Wolverton, and of other Lands, and assigns the Waste in cutting down Oaks in
quodam bosco vocat. Wolverton Wood, parcel praemissorum; and that cannot be:
for this Wood cannot be parcel of the Manor of Wolverton, and of the other
Lands also. And for these Causes, the Count by the whole Court was holden to be
insufficient.

XXIV. Stamfords Case. 7 Eliz. Dyer. In the Common Pleas
HUgh Stamford, seized in Fee, had Issue A. his eldest Son, and B. his younger
Son: A. had Issue George and Elizabeth by diverse Women; Hugh made a Feoffment
in Fee to the use of himself for life, and afterward to the use of George in
tail, and afterward to the use of A. in tail, and afterward to the use of the
right Heirs of Hugh: Hugh dies; A. dies; George levieth a Fine to the use of
himself in tail, the remainder over to B. in Fee, and dies without Issue: It
was holden by Bendloes, Carell, Kelloway, both the Bromleys, and Kingsmill,
That Elizabeth is barred by this Fine, by the Statute of 4 H. 7. and 32 H. 8.

XXV. 7 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
THe Case was this; Grandfather, Father, and Son: Lands are given to the
Grandfather for life, the remainder to the Son in tail; The Grandfather and
Father join in a Feoffment with warranty; The Feoffee makes a Lease for years,
and afterward conveys the Land to the Grandfather for life, the remainder to
the Father in Fee: The Grandfather and Father die; The Son enters, and puts
out the Lessee: Weston was of Opinion, That the Entry of the Son was lawful;
for it was the Feoffment of the Grandfather, and the Confirmation of the
Father, and the Warranty of the Grandfather collateral to the Father and his
Estate: but when the Land is re-assured, as above is said, and afterward the
Son enters after the death of the Grandfather and Father, now he is remitted,
and the warranty gone, by taking back the Estate: and the Son is now seized of
as high an Estate as his Ancestor was at the time that he departed with the
Land, by which the warranty is determined. Dyer, contrary: Here had not been
any discontinuance, if the warranty had not been; for the Father was never
seized by force of the entail; And I conceive, that against a warranty
collateral, one cannot be remitted; for it binds the Right, as a Fine with
Proclamation, after the Statute of 4 H. 7. And I conceive, that during the
possession of the Grandfather, the Warranty is but suspended, and not
determined: and although that by the death of the Grandfather it be determined;
yet having respect to the Lessee, it is in being; for his Estate is derived out
of the Estate which was warranted, and which descends with the Warranty.
Bendloes, One cannot make Title by a Collateral Warranty only, etc.

XXVI. Simonds Case. 8 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
IN a Formedom, the Tenant vouched Rose Simonds as Daughter and Heir of Henry
Simonds, Clerk; and because she was within age, he prayed that the Parol might
demur. Bendloes recited the Case to be this; A Fine was levied of the Lands to
Henry Simonds, upon Condition, etc. who rendered back the Land to the Conusor by
the same Fine; and that the said Henry Simonds never had any possession, or
seisin, but that which he had mean between the Conusans, and the Rendee; of
which possession the Wife should not be endowed: And therefore it is a good
Counter-plea to say, That the said Rose, nor any of her Ancestors, etc. for
that was not such a Seisin upon which Warranty might rise; and so if a
Feoffment in Fee had been made to the said Henry Simonds to the use of another:
And of that Opinion, was Dyer, Justice; for Henry Simonds had not any
possession by force of which he might be vouched. Welsh, contrary; For the Fine
imports in it self, that he has a Fee, and that he has granted and rendered
the same Fee, and this Fine amounts to a Feoffment. Dyer said to Bendloes, The
best way for you, is to plead the Counter-plea generally; and if he estop you
by the Fine, to demur upon it. Afterward, Bendloes moved another matter, viz.
Henry Simonds was a Priest, and therefore Rose is a Bastard; and if so, then
she cannot be vouched as Heir: But I would not trust the Bishop to Certify the
Bastardy, if I should plead it generally, and therefore I will plead the
special matter, and so it shall be tried by the Country. Dyer and Welsh, So you
may do, if you please; and yet if you plead general Bastardy, it shall be tried
by the Country; for Rose is not a party to the Writ; and in such case, Bastardy
shall be tried by the Country.

XXVII. Mich. 8 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
NOte; It was said by Dyer and Brown, Justices, That if a Man devises by his
Will to his Son, a Manor in tail, 2 Cro. 49. Yelv. 210.
and afterward by the same Will he devises a third part of the same Lands to
another of his Sons, they by this are Ioynt-Tenants: And if a Man in one part
of his Will devises his Lands to A. in Fee, and afterward by another Clause
in the same Will, devises the same to another in Fee, they are Ioynt-Tenants.

XXVIII. Drew Barrentines Case. Mich. 8 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
THe Case was; Drew Barrentine and Winifred his Wife, were seized of the Manor
of Barrentine, which is Ancient Demesne, and holden of the Lord Rich, as of his
Manor of Hatfield, levy a Fine thereof Sur Conusans de droit, etc. by which
Fine the Conusee renders the said Manor to the said Drew and Winifred in
special tail, the Remainder to Winifred in tail, the remainder to the Countess
of Huntington in tail, the remainder to the Heirs of the body of Margaret late
Countess of Salisbury, the remainder to the Queen in Fee: It was moved by
Bendloes, Sergeant, If the Lord Rich being Lord of the Manor, might reverse
this Fine by a Writ of Disceit, and so Recontinue his Seignory: and he said,
That he might; and thereby all the Estates which passed by the Fine, should be
defeated, even the remainder which was limited to the Queen, for by it the Fine
shall be avoided to all intents. Welsh, Justice, Such a Writ does not lie; For
by the remainder limited to the Queen by the Fine, all mean Signories are
extinct, Then, if it be so, Disceit does not lie. If the Tenant in Ancient
Demesne levieth a Fine, and afterward the Lord Paramount, who is Lord of the
Manor, does release to the Conusee, and afterward the Lord of the Manor
brings a Writ of Disceit, he gains nothing by it: And if the Tenant in Ancient
Demesne levieth a Fine of it, and dies, and the Heir confirms the Estate of
the Conusee, and afterward the Lord by a Writ of Disceit reverseth the Fine;
yet the Estate of the Conusee shall stand. But all these cases differ from our
case. For in all those cases, another act is done after the Action given to the
Lord; but in our case, the whole matter begins in an instant, and quasi uno
flatu, and then if the principal be reversed, the whole is avoided; For the
whole Estate is bound with the Condition in Law, and that condition shall
extend as well to the Queen and her Estate, as to another. And if Lands is
Ancient Demesne be assured to the King in Fee upon Condition, Now during the
possession of the King, the nature of the Ancient Demesne is gone; but if the
Condition be broken, so as he has his Land again, it is Ancient Demesne as it
was before: and so the Estate of the Queen is bounden by a Condition in Law.

XXIX. Mich. 8 Eliz. In the Dutchy-Chamber.
NOte; It was holden by Welsh in the Duchy Chamber, That whereas King Edw. the
6th, under the Seal of the Duchy, had demised Firmam omnium tenentium at Will
Manerii sui de S. That nothing but the Rent passed, and not the Land; for
Firma, signifies Rent; as in a Cessavit de feodo firmae: But the Clerks of the
Court said, That their course had always been, to make Leases in such manner.
But Welsh continued in his Opinion as aforesaid: And further he said, That this
was not helped by the Statute of Non-recital, or Mis-recital, etc. for that
here is not any certainty; For sometimes (Firma) signifies Land, sometimes Rent.

XXX. Mich. 8 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
THis Case was holden for Law by the whole Court; Two Coparceners are, and one
of them dies, her Heir of full age, she shall not pay a Relief; for if she
should pay any at all, she should pay but the moiety; and that she cannot do,
for a Relief cannot be apportioned, for Coparceners are but one Tenant to the
Lord.

XXXI. 8 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
AN Action upon the Case was brought, for stopping of a Way; The Plaintiff
declared, That the Duke of Suffolk was seized of a House in D. and Leased the
same to the Plaintiff for life; And that the said Duke, and all those whose
Estate, etc. have used time out of mind, etc. to have a Way over the Lands of
the Defendant unto the Park of D. to carry and recarry Wood necessary for the
same House, from the said Park to the same House; and further declared, That
the Defendant Obstupavit the Way. It was moved by Carns, That upon this matter,
no Action upon the Case lies, but an Assise, because that the Freehold of the
House is in the Plaintiff; and also the Freehold of the Land over which, etc.
is in the Defendant: But if the Plaintiff or Defendant had but an Estate for
years, etc. then an Action upon the Case would lie, and not an Assise: All
which was granted by the Court. Post. 263.
It was also holden, That this word* Obstupavit, was sufficient in it self;
scil. without showing the special matter how; as by setting up any Gate, Hedge
or Ditch, etc. for Obstupavit implies a Nusans continued, and not a personal
disturbance, as a Forestaller, or in saying to the Plaintiff upon the Land,
etc. that he should not go there, or use that Way; for in such cases, an Action
upon the Case lies. But as to any local or real disturbance, Obstupavit
amounts to Obstruxit: And although in the Declaration is set down the day and
the year of the Obstruction, yet it shall not be intended, that it continued
but the same day: for the words of the Declaration are further, by which he was
disturbed of his Way, and yet is; and so the continuance of the disturbance is
alleged: And of such Opinion also was the whole Court. Leonard, Prothonotary,
said to the Court, That he had declared of a Prescription, habere viam tam
pedestrem quam equestrem, pro omnibus and omnimodis Cariagiis, and by that
Prescription he could not have a Cart-way, for every Prescription is stricti
juris. Dyer, That is well Observed, and I conceive that the Law is so; and
therefore it is good to prescribe, habere viam pro omnibus Cariagiis,
generally, without speaking of Horse-way or Cart-way, or other Way, etc.

XXXII. Stowell and the Earl of Hertfords Case. Mich. 8 Eliz. In the Common
Pleas.
IN a Formedom in the Remainder by John Stowel and R.R. against the Earl of
Hertford, the Case was; That Lands were given to Giles Lord Daubeney in tail,
the remainder to the right Heirs of J.S. who had Issue two Daughters, Agnes and
Margaret, and died: The Donee died without Issue, and the Demandants as Heirs
of the said Agnes and Margaret, brought a Formedom in the Remainder: And it was
awarded by the Court, That the Writ should abate; For the Writ shall be brought
by the Heir of the Survivor of the said two Daughters, because they have that
remainder as purchasors.

XXXIII. Stuckly and Sir John Thynns Case. Mich: 9 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
THo. Stuckly; Administrator of the Goods and Chattels of one Tho. Curties,
Alderman of London, brought Debt upon an Obligation, against Sir John Thynn,
and demanded of him 1000 l. Et modo ad hunc diem venerunt, Tam praefatus Tho.
Stucklie, quam praedict. Johannes Thynn; Et super hoc, dies datus est usque
Oct. etc. in statu quonunc, etc. salvis, etc. At which day, the Defendant made
default, and thereupon the Plaintiff prayed his Judgment against the Defendant.
But the Opinion of the Court was, That he could not have it; but was put to
process over, because Dies Datus, is not so strong as a Continuance.

XXXIV. Luke and Eves Case. Pasch. 10 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
IN a Replevin by Luke against Eve, The Defendant Avowed, because that the Jury
at such a Leet did present, That the Plaintiff was a Resiant within the
Precinct of the said Leet, etc. and that the Plaintiff was warned to appear
there, and notwithstanding that made default: For which he was Amerced by the
Steward there to 5 s. And so for that Amercement, he avowed the taking, etc.
The Plaintiff in bar of the Avowry, pleaded, That at the time of the said Leet
holden, he was not a Resiant within the Precinct of the said Leet: Upon which
they were at Issue; And it was found for the Avowant. Whereupon Judgment was
given for the Avowant to have a Retorn.

XXXV. Mich. 14 Eliz. Rott. 1120. In the Common Pleas.
THe Abbot and Covent of York, Leased to J.S. certain Lands at Will; and
afterward by Deed Indented under their Covent Seal, reciting, That whereas
J.S. held of them certain Lands at Will, they granted and demised that Land to
the said J.S. to hold for life, rendering the ancient Rent; And by the same
Indenture granted the Reversion of the same Land to a stranger for life: It was
holden by the Court clear, That an Estate for life accrueth unto J.S. by way of
Confirmation, and the remainder unto the stranger depending upon the Estate
created by the Confirmation*

XXXVI. Sir Francis Carews Case. Mich. 14 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
SIr Nicholas Carew, seized of the Manor of A. of which Manor B. held certain
Lands; B. is disseissed by C. C. assures the same to Sir Nicholas Carew, who is
attainted of Treason; by which Attainder, the Manor and Land comes to King
Henry 8th who thereof dies seized, and the same descends to King Edward the
6th, who grants the same Manor to the Lord Darcy, who grants the same to Queen
Mary, who grants the same to Francis Carew, Son of Nicholas Carew, who by Fine
assures the same to the Lord Darcy; the Proclamations pass, and the 5 years
pass; she who has right to the Lands whereof the Desseisin was made, being for
all that time a Feme Covert; And therefore the Fine did not bar her: But
because that the King was entitled to the Land by a double matter of Record,
and by the descent from Hen. the 8th, to Ed. the 6th; And also because a
Seignory is reserved to the King upon the Grant made by King Edward the 6th, to
the Lord Darcy; The Justices were all of Opinion, That the Entry of the Heir of
the Disseisee was not lawful upon the Patentee of the Queen, 2 Len. 122.
but that she ought to be Relieved by way of Petition.

XXXVII. Mich. 14 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
A Man brought an Action of Trespass against another, for chasing of his Ewes
being great with Lambs, so as by such driving of them, he lost his Lambs. The
Defendant justified, because they were in his several Damage-feasans; wherefore
he took them, and drove them to the Pound: And it was holden by the whole
Court, to be no Plea: for, although that he might take; yet, he cannot drive
them with peril, etc.

XXXVIII. Mich. 14 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
More Rep. 16, 23.
THe Case was; A. made a Lease to B. for life, and further grants unto him, That
it shall be lawful for him to take Fuel upon the premises; Proviso, That he
do not cut any great Trees: It was holden by the Court, That if the Lessee
cutteth any great Trees, that he shall be punished in Waste: but in such case,
1 Len. 117.
the Lessor shall not re-enter, because that Proviso is not a Condition, but
only a Declaration and Exposition of the Extent of the Grant of the Lessor in
that behalf. And it was holden also by the Court, That Lessee for life, or for
years, by the Common Law, cannot take Fuel but of Bushes and small wood, and
not of Timber Trees. But if the Lessor in his Lease grants Fireboot expressly,
if the Lessee cannot have sufficient Fuel, as above, etc. he may take great
Trees.

XXXIX. Mich. 14 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
2 Roll. 787.
IN Trespass, upon an Evidence given to the Jury at the Bar, the Case appeared
to be thus; Land was given to A. in tail, the remainder in Fee to his Sisters,
being his Heirs at the Common Law: A. made a Deed in this manner; viz. I the
said A. have given, granted, and confirmed, for a certain piece of Money, etc.
without the words of Bargained, Sold: And the Habendum was to the Feoffee with
warranty against A. and his Heirs; And a Letter of Attorney was to make Livery
and Seisin: And the Deed was in this manner, To all Christian People, etc. And
the Deed was enrolled within one month after the making of it; And the Deed was
Indented, although that the words of the Deed, were in the form of a Deed Poll:
And after 4 months after the delivery of the Deed, the Attorney made Livery of
Seisin. A. died without Issue, and the Sisters entered, and the Feoffee ousted
them of the Land; and thereupon they brought an Action of Trespass: And the
Opinion of the whole Court, was for the Plaintiff; for here is not any
Discontinuance, for the Conveyance is by Bargain and Sale, and not by
Feoffment, because the Livery comes too late after the Inrollment, and then the
Warranty shall not hurt them: And although that in the Deed there be not any
word of Indenture, and also that the words are in the first person; Yet in as
much as the Parchment is Indented, 2 Roll. 787.
and both the parties have put their Seals to it, it is sufficient. Also, It
was clearly agreed by the Court, That the words, Give for Money, Grant for Money,
Confirm for Money, Agree for Money, Covenant for Money, If the Deed be duly
Enrolled, that the Lands pass both by the Statute of Uses, and by the Statute
of Inrollments, as well as upon the words of Bargain and Sale. And by Catline,
Wray, and Whiddon, the party ought to take by way of Bargain and Sale, and he
has not election to take the Land by way of Livery: But when all is in one
Deed, and takes effect equally together, in such case the Grantee has
Election; but here in this Case, the Bargain and Sale (the Deed being Enrolled)
does prevent the Livery, and takes his full effect before. And by Wray and
Catline, If he in the Reversion upon a Lease for years, grants his Reversion to
his Lessee for years by words of Dedi, Concessi, Feoffavi, and a Letter of
Attorney is made to make Livery and Seisin, the Donee cannot take by the Livery,
for that the Lessee has the Reversion presently.

XL. Mich. 14 Eliz.
IN an Ejectione Firmae, the Case upon Evidence appeared to be thus; The Bishop
of Rochester, Anno 4 E. 6. Leased to B. for years rendering Rent; and
afterward, granted the Reversion to C. for 99 years, rendering the ancient
Rent, To have from the day of the Lease without impeachment of Waste; which
Grant was confirmed by the Dean and Chapter: But B. did not Attorn; And for
default of Attornment, It was holden by the whole Court, That the Lease was
void; for it is made by way of grant of a Reversion, and to pass as a
Reversion. But by Catline, If the Bishop had granted the Reversion, and also
demised the Land for 99 years, it should pass as a Lease to begin first after
the former Lease determined. And as to the Attornment, it was given in
Evidence, That B. after the notice of the Grant to C. spoke with C. to have a
new Lease from him, because he had in his Farm but 8 years to come, but they
could not agree upon the price; And the Justices were of Opinion, That that was
an Attornment, because he had admitted the said C. to have power to make a new
Lease unto him. Also the said B. being in Company with one R. seeing the said
C. coming toward him, said to the said R. See my Landlord; meaning the said C.
Bromley, Solicitor, That is no Attornment, being spoken to a stranger. Barham,
contrary, because he was present. And it was held by the whole Court, to be a
good Attornment. But it was holden, That if the Attornment was not before that
the Bishop was translated to Winchester, That the Lease should be void: and
although that the Confirmation of the Dean and Chapter was before the
Attornment, so as no Estate had vested in C. yet it is good enough; for the
assent of the Dean and Chapter is sufficient, whether it be before or after; by
Catline, Southcote, and Whiddon: Wray, contrary.

XLI. Mich. 14 Eliz.
THe King seized of a Manor to which an Advowson is appendant, a Stranger
presents, and his Clerk is in by 6 months; The King grants the Manor, with all
Advowsons appendant to it, to B. The Incumbent dies, The Grantee may present;
For the Advowson was always appendant, and the Inheritance thereof passes to
the Grantee, and is not made disappendant by the usurpation, as in the case of
a common person, for the King cannot be put out of possession. But the Patentee
shall not have a Quare Imped. of the first disturbance, for that presentment
does not pass to him, being a thing in Action, without mention of it in his
Grant. And if the Patentee brings a Quare Impedit of the second Avoydance, he
shall make his Title by the presentment of the King, not making mention of the
usurpation; yet if the Bishop presents for Lapse in the case of a common
person, he ought to make mention of it; for that is his Title to the
Presentment, etc.

XLII. Humfrey and Humfrey's Case. Mich. 14 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
BEtween Humfrey and Humfrey, the Case was, That the Defendant in Debt after
Judgment aliened his Land; and the Plaintiff sued forth Execution upon the new
Statute: And the Court of the Request awarded him to the Fleet, because that he
sued forth Execution. Whereupon the Justices of the Common Pleas awarded a
Habeas Corpus, and discharged the Plaintiff. It was said by Bendloes, Sergeant,
That the Chancery after Judgment could not enjoin the party that he shall not
sue forth Execution; for if they do, the party shall have his remedy as above.

XLIII. Mich. 14 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
A Man seized of Copyhold Lands, Devises a certain parcel of them to his Wife
for life, the remainder to his Brother and his Heirs; And afterward in the
presence of 3 persons of the Court, said to them, I have made my Will, and I
have appointed all things in my Will as I will have it. And afterward he said,
And here, I surrender all my Copyhold Lands into your hands accordingly. And it
was moved, If all his Copyhold Lands should be to his Wife, or by those which
were specified in the Will. And the Opinion of the whole Court was, That the
Surrender is restrained by the Will, so as no more passes to the Wife upon the
whole matter, but that which is mentioned in the Will; and the general words
shall not enlarge the matter.

XLIV. Hill. 14 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
LAnds were devised to the Mayor, Chamberlain, and Governors of the Hospital of
St. Bartholomew in London, whereas in truth, they are Incorporated by another
name, yet the Devise is good, by Weston and Dyer; which Manwood also granted,
because it shall be taken according to the intent of the Devisor: And it was
said by Weston, If Lands be devised to A. eldest Son of B. although that his
name be W. yet the Devise to him is good, because there is sufficient
certainty, etc.

XLV. Pasch. 14 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
THe Case was; A. seized of Lands, devises the same to his Wife for life, the
remainder to his three younger Sons, and to the Heirs of their bodies begotten,
equally to be divided amongst them by even portions; and if one of them die,
then the other two which survive, shall be next Heirs. The Devisor dies, One
of the Sons dies; and, by Dyer and Weston, Justices, The 3 Brothers were
Tenants in Common in remainder. But contrary it is, where such a Devise is made
between them, To be divided by my Executors, etc. there they are Ioynt-Tenants,
until the division is made: but here, although the words are, Equally to be
divided, the same is not intended of a Division in fact and possession, but of
the Interest and Title; For if a Man brings a Praecipe quod reddat, de una
part Manerii de D. in 7 parts to be divided, it is not intended, divided in
Possession, but divided in Interest and Title. And it was said by the said
Justices, That although one of the Brothers dies, the two surviving Brothers
have his part by purchase, and not by descent, and they are Ioynt-Tenants of
it. And this was the Case of one Webster and Katherine his Wife, the late Wife
of John Bradbury.

XLVI. Pasch. 14 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
THe Case was; Lessee for years of the Pawnage of the Park of H. grants all his
Goods and Chattels, movables and immoveables within the said Park; It was
holden by Weston and Dyer, Justices, That the Lease of the Pawnage passes by
these words. And it was said by Dyer, If a Man has a Lease for years of a
House, and grants all his Goods and Chattels being in the same House, that as
well the Lease of the House as the Goods within it, pass by such a Grant.

XLVII. Pasch. 14 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
NOte: It was said by Weston, and Bendloes, That a Retraxit cannot be before a
Declaration; which Leonard and Filmer, Prothonotaries, granted: And Dyer said,
That it being before a Declaration, it is but a Nonsuit; and Wheatley and
Filmer affirmed the same: and therefore, it was adjudged, That such a Retraxit
in the Court of Hustings before the Sheriff, is no Plea in Bar.

XLVIII. Pasch. 14 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
IN Debt brought against Christmas, who showed forth a Protection, Quia
Profecturus with the Lord Hunsdon to Barwick: Dyer doubted, If the Protection
did lie? But said, It should be rather Moraturus, then Profecturus: For a
Protection Quia Profecturus to Calleis, was never good, but super victitation.
Calicii. Harper, contrary; For Barwick is out of the Realm: And he said, That
he was once of Counsel, Where a Bill was exhibited in Parliament, to make
Hexham part of England: and he said, That in the time of the Queen that now is,
One Carre struck a Man, who thereof died at Barwick; and in an Appeal thereof,
brought here by the Wife, Carre was dismissed.

XLIX. Cranmers Case. Hill. 14 Eliz. Rott. 938. In the Common Pleas.
Dyer 309, 310. 2 Len. 5. 1 Len. 196. 1 And. 19. More Rep. 100. Office of
Executors, 118. 119.
TThomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury, having a Reversion in Fee of
certain Lands upon a Lease for years, granted the Reversion to the use of the
Grantor himself for his life; and after his decease, to the use of the
Executors and Assignees of the Grantor for 20 years next after the death of the
Grantor; and after to the use of Thomas his Son in tail, and afterward to the
use of the Grantor in Fee: The Grantor is attainted of Treason, and the Queen
gave the said Term of 20 years to the Wife of the Grantor, who took to Husband
Ed. White-Church, who let the Land to A. Thomas the Son entered, and leased the
same Land to one Kirk, who upon an Ouster, brought Ejectione Firmae. This Case
was Argued by the Justices; Manwood, the puisne Justice, conceived, That the
Plaintiff ought to be barred, and that the Lessee of White-Church, who claimed
by the grant of the Queen the said Term of 20 years, ought to hold the Land
against the Son of the Grantor; For the remainder limited to the Son, is not
yet begun in possession. And he insisted much in his Argument upon this point,
That Uses limited upon any Conveyance, are governed and directed according to
the Rules of the Common Law: As if a Feoffment in Fee be made unto the use of
another for life, the remainder to the use of the Lessee for life, and the
Heirs of his body, etc. now the party has an estate tail executed in
possession, and that is according to the Rule of the Common Law. And he cited
the Case of 40 E. 3. 20. Where Land was given by Fine to A.B. and C. and to the
Heirs of the body of C. and for default of such Issue, the remainder to the
right Heirs of A. C. died without Issue; B. dyed, and afterward A. died; his
Heir brought a Scire facias out of the said Fine: And by Judgment of the Court,
the Scire facias did not lie, for the Fee was vested in the Father of the
Demandant, although that ex vi verbi, the remainder was limited not to the
Father, but to his Heirs: But where Uses are limited in other manner than
according to the Rules of the Common Law, there they shall not be ruled and
governed by the Rules of the Common Law: As if Lands be given to the use of one
for life, and to the use of such Lessees to whom the Tenant for life shall
demise the same for years or life, rendering Rent, the remainder over to a
stranger in tail, and afterward the Tenant for life makes a Lease for years,
or life, and dies; such a Lease shall bind him in the remainder, although that
the Lessor had not but for life, and be now dead: for the Use limited here to
the Lessees, which would be, was limited contrary to the Rules of the Common
Law. For by the Common Law, such Leases made by Tenant for life, are determined
by his death: And in this Case, This Lease for 20 years, after the death of the
Grantor, was limited according to the Rules of the Common Law, and therefore it
shall take effect accordingly, as if it had passed in possession, and not in
use, as if the Conveyance had been of the Land it self, and that Land had been
granted to the Grantor for 20 years after his death, that Interest had been
vested in him to sell, forfeit, or otherwise to dispose at his pleasure, and
shall not accrue to the Executors as a purchase. 19 E. 2. Fitz. Covenant, 25.
Land was Leased to one for life, and after his decease, to his Executors and
Assigns for 10 years; the Lessee assigned the Term; And, by Herle, it is a good
Assignment; For it is in the Election of the Lessee to Devise that Interest, or
to assign it in his lifetime. And see 39 E. 3. 25. A Lease was made to one for
life, and a year over. 17 E. 3. 29. Lessee for life, so as after his death, the
Land remain to his Executors for 8 years; Lessee for life died; He who had the
Freehold of the Land was impleaded, who rendered the Land, and the Executors of
the Lessee for life prayed to be received; scil. (where as Executors do hold
the Term;) which proves, that they had the Term as Executors to the use of the
Testator, and so Assets, therefore the same was before in the Lessee for life.
But by Dyer, in his Argument, That Case does not prove it, and certain^y it is
not Assets; For although the Executor have the same Term by purchase, yet they
have it as Executors, for that is a good name of purchase, which Harper
concessit: And Manwood argued further, and he Cited 19 E. 3. Fitz. Covenant,
24. Land was let for life, and if the Lessee died within 12 years, that his
Executors should hold the same until the end of the 12 years; The Lessee for
life died, and the Executors entered, and the Executors of the Lessee for life
brought Actions of Covenant, which proved, that the Executors had the Term as a
Chatel vested in the Testator, and not in their own Rights as Purchasors, by
the name of Executors. See 22 Ass. 37. Land demised to A. ad totam vitam suam;
Et ulterius concessi^, that if the Lessee obierit infra 20 annos proxime
sequent. the said Lessee potuit legare and dare praedict. tenementa alicui
personae usque ad terminum praedict. 20 annorum, etc. and Dyer cited the Case,
16 E. 3. Quid juris clamat, 22. Land was leased to one for life, and if the
Lessee died within the Term of 20 years, that his Executors or Assigns should
have it until the end of the said 20 years, and a Quid juris clamat was brought
against the Lessee for life without any mention of any other Estate. To which
the Defendant pleaded the special matter, and demanded Judgment upon that Fine,
if he should be driven to Attorn, where he is supposed Tenant for life only;
And it is there said, That that special matter is but a Protestation to save
the Term to his Executors. And upon such a Fine, such Tenant has been driven
to Attorn: And by Dyer, If the Lessee does not make such protestation, yet his
special interest is not impaired by it; yet it is but reason that it be entered
for the more manifestation of it. 32 E. 3. Quid juris clamat, 5. A Lease to W.
for life, and 20 years over, he may grant the same Term or any part of it: And
he cited the Case between Parker and Gravenor, 3. and 4 Mar. Dyer, 150. Where a
Lease for life was made, and by the Indenture of Lease Provisum fuit, That if
the Lessee died within the Term of 60 years, that then his Executors and
Assigns should have and enjoy the said Lands pro termino totidem annorum, which
did amount to the number of 60 years, to be accounted from the date of the
Indenture. And it was the Opinion of the Court, That that was not any Lease:
But they all agreed, That a Lease for years in remainder might be upon a Lease
for life in the same person. See 40 E. 3. A Lease was made for life, and half a
year after; the Lessee died, and Waste is brought against the Executors,
supposing that the Testator held for years; and the Writ was holden good: And
there it is said by Kirton, That the Executors could not have that Term, unless
it were in the Testator; and there the Term is not limited to any person. And
see 11 H. 4. 187. Annuity granted to one for life, and 20 years after. And 50
E. Ass. 1. A Lease for life, and 3 years over to his Executors. And then here
in our Case, This Use being limited in Order, according to the Rules of the
Common Law, shall vest in the Grantor to give or forfeit, and then by the
Attainder it was forfeited to Queen Mary: and if so, then the Plaintiff shall
be barred. Harper, Justice, to the contrary; And that the Interest in the
Remainder for years limited to the Executors and Assigns of the Grantor is in
abeyance, and not in the Grantor, and then it cannot be forfeited: But if this
Use had been limited to the Grantor himself, then all had been in him to give,
etc. But here in our Case, the Remainder for years is limited and appointed to
the Executors, etc. Also, Uses shall not be ruled in such manner as Lands; but
the Law shall rule the possession obtained by use in another manner, than the
possession obtained by the Order of the Common Law: As in the Case of Amy
Townsend, Plow. Com. 111, 112. Where the Husband seized in the right of his
Wife, made a Feoffment in Fee to the use of himself and his Wife for life, with
diverse remainders over; Now is not the Wife remitted, as she should be by
Conveyance at Common La: as if the Husband discontinueth the Land in the right
of his Wife, and the Discontinuee gives the Lands to the Husband and Wife, and
to a third person, she is remitted to the whole, and the third person has not
any thing. Dyer, to the same intent; And here we ought to intend and consider,
That it was the purpose of Cranmer, to advance his Executors with this Term
unto their own use and benefit, and not to leave the same in himself. And I do
conceive, That the use is in abeyance until the Executors are made, or an
Assignee appointed; for he may make an Assignee who shall have the Term: For
Assignee may be made two ways, 1 By grant of an Estate which is in the Grantor
before; 2 A person nominated and appointed by another to take any thing, etc.
And it shall be also intended, That Cranmer was purposed to make other
Provision to leave to his Executors Assets to perform his Will; and not that
that Term should be applied to that purpose, for then he would have showed it
in the Conveyance by words; scil. as to pay his Legacies, and perform his last
Will: And the Cases put by my Brother Manwood, do not go to the Point; For I
agree, Where Lands are given to one for life, the remainder for years, and does
not say to whom, it cannot be intended to any other but to the Lessee for life;
or otherwise it shall be void. And also where Land is given to one for life,
and for two years after to his Executors or Assigns, or Heirs, all is in the
Lessee, for all is as one gift: But where it is given to one for life, and
after his death, the remainder to his Executors, I do not see any reason that
that remainder should be any Assets in the hands of the Executors; Or that if
the Lessee dies Intestate, that his Administrator should have it; and
therefore the Executors shall have the same as a purchase: But Cranmer might
have given the same, or appointed one in the mean time to receive it, and in
the mean time it shall be in abeyance. Also if Lands be Leased to B. for life,
the remainder for years to his Heirs, the same remainder for years is in
abeyance until the death of the Lessee, and then it shall vest in the Heir as a
Purchasor, and as a Chattel, and shall go to the Executor of the Heir, etc. and
the Tenant for life cannot meddle with it, for it is not in him: Also, Uses
shall not be raised as Lands; i.e at the Common Law, but shall be raised by the
Statute, and as Uses were raised in the Chancery before the Statute. And
therefore if this Conveyance had been before the Statute, he could not have
compelled the Feoffees to dispose of that Interest at his pleasure, etc. And
then Cranmer the Son shall have the Land by force of the entail limited unto
him; For the Estate for years is gone, because no assignment of it is made, nor
any Executors who can take it, and the Estate for life is determined by the
death of Cranmer; and the Feoffee to an Use cannot have it, for there is not
any Consideration whereof he should have any Use; for by the Limitation,
nothing was left in the Feoffee: And so I conceive, that the Plaintiff shall
recover. See the Case, 14 Eliz. in Dyer.

L. Mich. 15 Eliz. In the Common Pleas. Tottenham and Bedingfields Case.
Owen Rep. 35, 83.
IN an Account by Tottenham against Bedingfield, who pleaded, That he never was
his Bailiff to render account, the Case was, That the Plaintiff was possessed
of a Parsonage for Term of years, and the Defendant not having any Interest,
nor claiming any Title in them, took the Tithes being set forth, and severed
from the 9 parts, and carried them away, and sold them. Upon which, the
Plaintiff brought an Action of Account: And by Manwood, Justice, the Action
does not lie, for here is not any privity; for wrongs are always done without
privity: And yet I do agree, That if one does receive my Rents, I may implead
him in a Writ of Account, and then by the bringing of my Action there is
privity: and although he has received my Rent, yet he has not done any wrong
to me; for that it is not my Money until it be paid unto me, or unto another for
my use, and by my Commandment: and therefore notwithstanding such his Receipt,
I may resort to the Tenant of the Land, who ought to pay unto me the said Rent,
and compel him to pay it to me again; and so in such case, where no wrong is
done unto me, Hob. 32^.
I may make a privity by my consent to have a Writ of Account: But if one
disseiseth me of my Land, and takes the profits thereof, upon that no Action
of Account lies; for it is merely a wrong. And in the principal case, so soon
as the Tithes were severed by the Parishioners, there they were presently in
the Plaintiff, and therefore the Defendant by the taking of them, was a wrong
doer, and no Action of Account for the same lies against him. And upon the
like reason was the Case of Monox of London lately adjudged; which was, That
one devised Land to another, 1 Len. 266.
and died; and the Devisee entered, and held the Land devised for the space of
20 years; and afterward for a certain cause, the Devise was adjudged void, and
for that he to whom the Land descended, brought an Action of Account against
the Devisee: And it was adjudged, That the Action did not lie. Harper,
contrary; For here the Plaintiff may charge the Defendant as his Proctor, and
it shall be no Plea for the Defendant to say, That he was not his Proctor, no
more than in an Account against one who holds as Guardian in Socage, it is no
plea for him to say, that he is not Prochein Amy to the Plaintiff. Dyer, The
Action does not lie; If an Account be brought against one as Receiver, he ought
to be charged with the Receipt of the Money: and an Account does not lie, where
the party pretends to be Owner, as against an Abater or Disseisor; but if one
claims as Bailiff, he shall be charged, and so it is of Guardian in Socage.
Latch 8.
And it was agreed, That if a Disseisor assign another to receive the Rents,
that the Disseisee cannot have an Account against such a Receivor.

LI. 15 Eliz. In the Court of Wards.
NOte: That this Case was ruled in the Court of Wards; That where Tenant of the
King, of Lands holden by Knights Service in chief, made a Feoffment in Fee of
the same Lands to the use of himself for life, and afterward to the use of his
younger Son in tail, the remainder to the right Heirs of the Feoffor, and died,
his eldest Son within age, That the Queen should have the Wardship of his body,
and of the third part of the Land; and when the eldest Son comes of full age,
that the younger Son should sue Livery, and pay* Primer Seisin according to the
rate and value of the whole Land, viz. of the third part as in possession, and
of the two parts as a Reversioner: For the remainder to the right Heirs of the
Feoffee, is in truth a Reversion; for the Fee simple was never out of him,
because there is not any consideration as to that, nor any Use expressed. And
because Livery shall not be sued by parcels, the younger Son shall not be
suffered to sue Livery of the third part presently, and respite the residue as
to the two parts in Reversion, until the Reversion fall; but he shall sue
Livery presently as well of the two parts in reversion, as of the third part in
possession: and if the eldest Son had been of full age at the time of the death
of his Father, the younger Son should pay Primer Seisin as to the third part,
the whole value of it for one year as in possession; and as to the two parts,
the moiety of the value of a year, as of a Reversion.

LII. Oliver Breers Case. 15 Eliz. In the Court of Wards.
OLiver Breer, who was Tenant in Chief by Knights Service, made a Feoffment in
Fee to the use of himself for life, and afterward to the use of A. his eldest
Son and Heir for life, and after to the use of the first begotten Son of the
said A. in tail; and afterward to the use of the second Son of the said A.
etc. and for default of such issue, to the use of the right Heirs of the
Feoffor; Oliver died, the said A. his Son being of full age; It was holden by
the Council of the Court of Wards, That he should pay for his first Primer
Seisin, a third part as in possession; and two parts as a reversion. See the
Case before.

LIII. Mich. 15 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
NOte: 1 Roll. 626*
This Case was moved to the Justices in the Court of the Kings Bench: A Man had
Issue two Daughters by diverse Women; and being seized of Lands in Fee, he made
his Will, and by the same Devised, That his Wife should have the moiety of his
Lands for years, and that his eldest Daughter at the day of her Marriage,
should enter into the other moiety; his eldest Daughter married and died
without Issue: And the Question was, Whether her Uncle should have that moiety
or the fourth part of the whole Land. Catline conceived, and said, That when
the Devise which was made to the eldest Daughter, that she might enter after
certain years, is not the Inheritance in her presently, and the other words
void? So he said here, That it is not a purchase in the eldest Daughter, but
both the Daughters should enter in Common as one Heir to their Father, until
the Marriage; and then the Inheritance which was once settled in them, should
not be removed. Southcote, Justice, said, There are no words of Limitation of
any Estate that the Daughter should have after the Marriage, and therefore the
Devise was void; and if he had limited, that the Daughter after Marriage should
have it for life, the Fee-simple is vested in her before, and then she cannot
have it for life. And he said, That if a Lease be made to the eldest Daughter
for years by the Father, and afterward the Land descends to her and her
Sister, as unto one moiety of the Land, the Lease is determined, but not as to
the other moiety. Whiddon, Justice, Where a Devise is for the benefit of a
stranger, there the Heir shall take by the Devise, and not by descent. As if a
Lease be made for years, the remainder to the Heir, there the Heir shall take
the Land by the Devise. Catline, She has it be Descent, and not by the Devise.
But if he devises the Land to the Heir in tail, with this, That he shall pay a
certain sum of Money unto another, there the Heir shall take by the Devise, for
the benefit which may accrue to the stranger, and not by descent, for otherwise
the Will should not be performed: But where the Estate of the Heir is altered
by the Will, nor any benefit does accrue unto another after that the Lands come
to the hands of the Heir; in that case he shall have the Land by descent: And
so here in this case for as much as the Devise is, That the Daughter shall
enter, they both being but one Heir to their Father, shall have the Land by
descent; and the words of the Will, That he shall enter into the moiety, shall
be void; as, if the Devise had been to the Heir for life, there the same is
void, because the Fee-simple which descends to her, does drown the particular
estate for life. And therefore in the principal case here, the Uncle shall have
but the moiety of the moiety which is so devised, and the other Sister shall
have the other moiety of the Land; and as to that moiety which is devised to
the Wife for years, the same shall enure according to the Common Law, that the
Uncle shall have the moiety of that; and the other Sister the other moiety.

LIVE. Mich. 15 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
THis Case was moved to the Court by Lovelace, Sergeant; A Man Covenants with
another to make and execute an estate of such Lands as should descend to him
from his Father and Grandfather by a certain day, the same Lands to be of the
clear yearly value of 40 Marks: And the Question which he moved to the
Justices, was, That if the party had more Lands which came to him from his
Grandfather and Father, than did amount to the yearly value of 40 Marks, If he
was to make assurance of all the Lands, or of so much thereof only as amounted
to the value of 40 Marks? And Manwood, Justice, conceived, That he should make
assurance of Lands only which were of the value of 40 Marks per annum: For the
words (such which) do not go so largely as if he had said, All my Lands which
shall descend, or to me be descended; for then the yearly value were but a
demonstration, and all his Lands ought to be assured. But here the Intent of
the Indenture cannot be taken otherwise, than to have but an Assurance of so
much Land; as if he had said, Of such Lands and Tenements as were my
Grandfathers, and Fathers, amounting to 40 Marks by the year: for there by
those words, he shall have but 40 Marks by the year. Lovelace, It has been
taken, That where the Queen made a Lease of all her Lands in such a Town,
amounting to the yearly value of 40 l. that that valuation is not a
demonstration, and shall not abridge the Grant precedent, to have all in the
Town which should be of the value of 40 l. but her Grant shall be taken and
construed according to the words precedent. Manwood, The Common case of
assurance upon a settlement of Marriage is, That he shall stand seized of so
much of his Land as shall be of the clear yearly value of 40 Marks; If the
marriage take effect, The Question has been, If they to whom the assurance is
made, may enter into any part of the Land at their election, and take that
which is the best Land, to the value of 40 Marks per annum, and hold the same
in severalty, or if they shall be only Tenants in Common with the other? And
also it has been a Question, Whether they may choose one Acre in one place,
and another Acre in another place, and so through the whole Land where they
please, because the Grant shall be taken strong against him that grants: But
I conceive, that it should be a hard case to make such Election of Acres. But
it was said by some Sergeant at the Bar, That if a Man grants to another to
take 20 Trees in his Lands, that the Grantee may cut down one Tree in one
place, and another in another place: Manwood agreed that Case: but of the other
Case, the Court doubted of it. The principal case was adjourned.

LV. Vernon and Vernons Case. Mich. 15 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
NOte; That in the Case of Dower between Vernon and Vernon, and the Argument of
it, the Plaintiff would have been Nonsuit. Dyer, Justice, said, It should be an
ill President, if a Nonsuit should be after Demurrer: And therefore he said,
That for his part he would not agree, that any Nonsuit should be upon it; but
he said, he would be advised, and take better Consideration of it, If the
Nonsuit should be awarded, or not. And afterward at another day, Manwood and
Dyer took a difference, where the Nonsuit is the same Term, and where in
another Term; and said, It is like unto the Case, where a Man would Wage his
Law, and is present ready to do it, that there the Plaintiff cannot be Nonsuit,
because it is in the same Term, but he shall be barred: But in another Term
afterward he might be Nonsuit, if the Defendant take day over to wage his Law
until another Term; and so they said it should be in this case.

LVI. Sir Peter Philpots Case. Mich. 15 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
THis Case was moved by Meade, Sergeant to the Justices of the Court of Common
Pleas, viz. That Sir Peter Philpot Knight, seized in Fee of diverse Manors and
Lands, suffered a Recovery, and made a Feoffment thereof unto diverse persons,
To the use of himself for life, the remainder to his right Heirs: And after the
Statute of 32 H. 8. of Wills, He devised all his said Manors and Land to his
Wife for life; and it was expressed in his Will, That he could not devise all
his Lands, by reason of the Statute of 32 H. 8. that his Will was, That his
Wife should have so much which might be devised by the Laws of the Land: And
there was another Clause in the said Will, That his Feoffees should stand
seized of the same Manors and Lands after the death of his Wife, To the use of
one Hurlock and others for years, for the payment of his Debts, and for the
raising of Portions for the preferment of his Daughters in Marriage: And
further by his said Will he willed, That if the Law would not bear it, That
Hurlock and the others should have the Interest, Then he willed that his Son
should have all his Manors and Lands, and should pay his Debts, and should
give certain sums of Moneys for the Marriage Portions of his Daughters; And the
Question which was moved to the Court, was, Whether the first part of his Will,
That is to say, That Hurlock and the others should have his Lands, etc. were
void, or not, by the later words of his Will? Dyer, Justice, said, That the
last words of the Will did well expound the meaning of the first words, and
that the Will should be performed as it might be: And afterward Harper said,
That upon this matter, Hurlock and the others had had a Decree in the Court of
Wards, to have the whole Lands during the years, and not two parts of the Lands
only. Dyer, Justice, said, That the Will of Sir Tho. Umpton, which was made
mean between the Statutes of 32 H. 8. and 34 H. 8. and which is excepted by the
same Statute, that it should not be construed in other form than according to
the first Statute was, Of all his Lands. And upon a Demurrer argued, It was
adjudged, That the Will was good of two parts, although that by the Will it was
not divided: For where a Man has a Warrant to do a thing, and he does it, and
more, so as he exceeds his Warrant, yet it is good for that part for which it
is warranted; and void for the rest: As if a Man makes a Warrant of Attorney to
make Livery and Seisin of the Manor of Dale, and he makes Livery of the
Manors of Dale and Sale; it is good for the Manor of Dale, and void for the
Manor of Sale. The Case was, in a Writ of Partition: And afterward the Record
was removed by a Writ of Error, supposing that this Court had Erred; and the
Judgment was affirmed by three of the Justices of the Kings Bench. But because
there was a Discontinuance in the Record, which was erroneous, for that the
first Judgment was reversed, but not for any other cause. And such was the
meaning and intent of the Statute of 32 H. 8. before the making of the Statute
of 34 H. 8. of Explanation of Wills. And therefore here in the principal Case,
it was holden, That the Will was good for two parts, both to the Wife, and also
to Hurlock and the others. And it was holden, That by the Intent of the Will,
that the Son was to pay such sums of Moneys a Hurlock was to have paid, so as
the Will was not for the advantage of the Heir, but to be construed according
to the meaning of Philpot, That if Hurlock could not have the Lands, etc. that
then the Son should have them, but with such charge as aforesaid; and it was no
Intent to subvert the first part of the Will, if the same might stand with the
Law. And so it was adjudged.

LVII. Mich. 15 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
THe Case was this; A Man makes a Lease for 30 years; More Rep. 94 Post. 55.
Winch. Rep. 5.
and bargains and sells the Woods in and upon the Premises to the Lessee, and
that he might carry them off the Lands during the time of 30 years: The Lessee
cut down all the Woods; and afterward other Wood grew up from the Stocks, and
the Lessee cut them also within the Term; and the Lessor brought an Action of
Waste for cutting of the new Wood. And it was moved by Meade, Hob. Rep. 132.
Sergeant, If the Action of Waste would lie, or not? Harper, Justice, Is the
Bargain, de bosco and subbosco, growing in and upon the Premises? Meade, No;
but all his Woods in and upon the Premises. Harper, The Grant is in the
present tense in praesenti; so as he cannot have that which shall grow there,
after: And if he would grant all his Woods which should grow in time to come,
the Grant should not be good, because it is not of a thing in esse. And if a
Man will grant all his Wood growing upon Black-Acre, and there be then no Wood,
he cannot have any thing, although that afterward, Woods grow there; and if
his meaning had been, That he should have the Wood which should there after
grow, he would have expressed the same in another form. Mounson, If a Man
grants all his Hay growing upon his Land; Hob. 132.
shall he have that which is growing there, after? No truly; And if he grant
all the Wool which is growing upon his Sheep, shall he have more than that
which grows this year? Meade, No truly: But if he had granted all the Wool
growing upon the Sheep for 20 years, then the same is like to our case; for he
has granted, that he may carry the Wool during the 30 years. Harper, The same
is but a Liberty to fell the Trees which where growing at the time of the Sale,
and to carry them when he pleases, and not to give other Trees or Wood, which
should there after grow.

LVIII. Mich. 15 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
LOvelace, Sergeant, moved this Case to the Court, That an Assise was brought
of the Office of Registership in the County of Devon: And he showed, How that
the Bishop of Exeter granted the Office, and showed the name of the Bishop: And
that after William Alley Bishop there, granted the same Office after the death
of the first Grantee to the Plaintiff: And further he showed, That the Bishop
might grant the Office ad Idoneam personam: And because he does not say in his
Plaint, That the person to whom it was granted, is idonea persona, I conceive,
that the Plaint is not good; for if there be no such person which can exercise
the Office, he shall not have it: For that is a Condition which is annexed to
the Office, that he be a fit person who shall take it: And the Prothonotaries
of this place ought to have skill in that which appertains to their Office;
For if such an Office should be given to a Courtier who has not skill in that
which appertains to the Office, nor knowledge how to execute, he shall not
have it. Also he said, That he has not showed, that the first Bishop is dead,
or that he has resigned; or whether that he be deprived; and therefore it
shall be intended, that he continues, unless the contrary be showed: And then
the Grant made by Alley to the Plaintiff, cannot be good. And for these causes,
and for others, he prayed to know the Opinion of the Court. Dyer, Justice, The
matter is not before us; and wherefore should we give our Opinions to serve the
fancy of every person, and to resolve the doubts of every Court? But if the
matter laid come before by Adjournment for difficulty, because the Justices of
Assise are of diverse Opinions, or that they doubted of any thing upon such
difficulty and adjournment, we use to show our Opinions, and to take some pains
to search our Books to Resolve the doubts; but when we have not any thing
before us; but are moved for the pleasure of the parties, What Resolutions
shall we make by speaking at random? Manwood, As to the first Exception, I, nor
my Brother Jeffery, do not doubt of it, but that the Plaint was good,
notwithstanding that it is not showed, that he was idonea persona, for the Law
shall intend him so to be, until the contrary he showed. And so it is of a
grant of an Annuity, as long as he se been gesserit, the Law shall intend that
he carries himself well, until the contrary be showed. But as to the other
Point, That he does not show the death of the first Bishop, my Brother Jeffery
doubted of it, but I make no doubt of it, for that is but a Recital, and the
Plaintiff makes his title but from Bishop Alley, and therefore that is not
material, nor parcel of his Plaint, whether the predecessor of Alley be alive,
or not; for he does not derive any Title from him, but from Alley. Dyer, Can a
Bishop grant an Office in Reversion, without title of Prescription, that they
have used so to do time out of mind? And here no Prescription is laid, that the
Bishop might so do. And then, as I conceive, the Reversion of the Office cannot
be granted, for there is not any Reversion of it: and it is not like unto an
Advowson, which may be granted, that the Grantee may present when it shall be
next void. And as I conceive, No Reversion of any Office can be granted, if not
by the King who has a special Prerogative; For he reciting, how that such an
one has such an Office for life, he may grant that such a person shall have
the same Office after the death of the first Grantee. And so the Queen may
grant the Reversion of such an Office; as if she recite, that such an one is
Keeper of such a Park, there she may grant the Keepership of it after the death
of another: But if a Common person will grant the Stewardship of his Courts
after the death of such a person as is now Steward, or the Reversion of it, the
same is not good: For of Offices, there is not any Fee, or Reversion, But a
Nomination which the party has to name what person he pleases when the same
shall become void. Manwood, It is the Order in the Arches, and in the
Prerogative Court, and of all the Courts of Paul's, to grant the Offices in
Reversion, as in the Case of Doctor Drury and others, who have the Reversion of
every Office which does belong to the Spiritual Courts. Dyer, I do not care,
nor regard what they do, but what they ought to do; and I do not respect the
person of any one in relating the Law; But it may be, that by words of
Covenant, such a Covenant may be good: And of late time here a Case has been
adjudged, That where one prescribed, that such an one might grant an Office,
cuicunque personae idoneae voluerit, and the Grant was made to two, and because
the prescription did not warrant this manner of grant, it was adjudged void;
for when the prescription is to grant alicui personae, and not quibuscunque
personis, by that, he cannot grant it but to one person, and not unto diverse,
because the prescription does not extend so far. Manwood, I conceive there is a
difference betwixt such persons who have Offices for life, as the Admiral of
England, the Lord Treasurer, the Justices of the two Benches, which have
Offices incident to their Courts, they cannot grant any of those Offices in
Reversion; But a Bishop has a Fee, and therefore the Cases are not alike.
Dyer, he has not prescribed in the person of the Bishop here; but he has
said, That the Custom is, That the Bishop may grant the said Office, whereas in
truth, if there were a prescription, he ought to prescribe, That the Bishop for
the time being might grant the said Office in possession or in reversion: And
so as I conceive here, no Office shall be granted in reversion, unless by
prescription; which ought to be alleged. And in the time of this Queen, an
Office of this Court was granted to Fry and his Son by the King; and the Patent
was showed here in Court, and rejected: and it was said, there was no place in
Court for two to sit there, and the Office might be exercised as well by one,
as by two; and therefore the Patent was disallowed. And although that Offices
are granted to two, as now in the Kings Bench of late time, there is not any
President to warrant the same; and therefore, as I conceive, such a Grant is
not good, nor warranted by the Law; for I do not regard in this Case, against
what persons I speak. Mounson, In the Chancery, a Patent was granted to Bagot
and Swirenden, of an Office in the Chancery by King Henry the 6th, and in 9 E.
4. it is is disputed, Whether the Grant were good, or not, etc.

LIX. Mich. Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
THe Case was; A Man Mortgageth his Lands, to pay to the Mortgagee his Heirs,
Executors, or Assigns, a certain sum of Money at a day certain: The Mortgagee
dies, and makes his Heir within age his Executor; and the Mortgagor pays the
Money at the day to the Heir: It was holden, The same shall be Assets in the
hands of the Heir as Executor, and that he has not the Money as Heir, and he
shall be charged with it, within age.

LX. Mich. 15 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
THe Case was this; A Man had made a Lease for 40 years to one by Indenture, if
the Lessee should so long live; and afterward by another Deed he demised the
same Lands and Tenements to the same Lessee, To have to his Executors and
Assigns for 40 years after the expiration of the first Lease. And Lovelace,
Sergeant, demanded the Opinion of the Court, (the Lord Dyer being then in the
Star Chamber) Whether in this Case, the Lessee should have the Interest in the
second Lease, or his Executors; or whether it was a void Lease? Harper,
Justice, said, That in every Lease there are 3 things incident to make it good,
1. That there be a Lessor to make the Lease. 2. That there be a Lessee to take
the Lease. And, 3. That there be a thing which should be which should be let:
And then he said, That here, although that there be a Lessor, and a thing which
should be leased, yet here there was not any Lessee: For Executors are not
until after the death of the Testator: But he said, That if a Lease be made for
years, or for life, and that the Executors shall have the same for certain
years after his death, the same is good; for there is an Interest of the Term.
And if a Man makes a Lease to begin at the month of Easter, his Executors may
have this Term, because the same was an Interest of a Term in the Lessee, and
the Term shall be executed at Easter: But here in this case, there is no person
to take it, and therefore he conceived, That the Lease was void. Mounson,
Justice, The Case is as it is recited: And he said, That the Premises of a
Deed, is to limit the person who shall have the Lease, and the Habendum shall
not declare the person who shall have it, or the Lease, but to declare the
Estate which shall be in the Lease; and it is but a limitation of the Estate:
and if the Premises do not limit the person who shall have it, the Habendum
shall not give any thing to the person, unless it be expressed in the Premises
what person shall have it: and therefore when he says, Habendum to his
Executors and Assigns, these words ( Executors and Assigns) are void: But when
a Man makes a Lease to one, Habendum to his Executors and Assigns, the same is
not void; for if Livery be made, his Heir shall take it after his death.
Harper, By the Lease of the same Land by a new Deed, as the Case is here,
nothing shall pass without an Habendum: And if a Lease be made to the Lessee,
Habendum to his Executors, he himself has no Estate; and when no Estate is
limited, the person in the Premises gains not any thing, and without the
Habendum, he cannot have any thing. Lovelace, If I may declare my Opinion, This
new Lease shall be a Lease in possession as a Confirmation of the first Lease,
and shall be taken to be a Lease for life, and the Habendum shall be void; and
therefore he prayed the Opinion of Manwood, Justice, therein: Who said, That in
every Lease there are 3 Principals, as he had said, of Lessor, Lessee, and
thing Let: And by the Premises, the Lessor and Lessee are expressed; and by
the Habendum, the Interest which the Lessee shall have, ought to be set forth;
and if no Habendum be in the Deed to express any certainty of time, the Lessee
by the same shall be Tenant of your Opinion, Brother Lovelace, That the same
shall be a Lease for life, unless that in the second Deed the words had been,
That he Leased and Granted; by which word, Grant, it might enure and amount to
a Lease for life: but if the Deed had been, Demise and Grant, that cannot be
intended for the life of the Lessee; And as I have said before, by apt words it
might enure to a Confirmation, and make it a Lease for life; but by the
Premises it is not so, and by this Deed it is not expressed, that the Lessee
shall take a Freehold; for by the Habendum, his mind appears to be otherwise
by agreement betwixt the parties, that his Executors and Assigns should have it
for a certain time after his death, and that he himself would not have it, for
he has sufficiently provided for himself, to have if for 40 years, if he
lives so long, although it cannot be intended, that he should live beyond the
Term which he has, so as it cannot be taken to be the meaning of the parties,
that he should have it as a Lease for life: and when by the Premises of the
Deed, the parties are not named, the Habendum shall never bring in a strange
person: As, where a Lease is made to the Husband, Habendum to the Wife, the
Habendum to her is a void, because it shall not introduce one who is a stranger
to the Premises of the Deed. And as my Brother Mounson has said, The Office
of the Premises of a Deed is to limit the persons who shall have it, and the
Office of the Habendum is to limit the Estate of the thing which is granted;
and therefore when the Habendum is to such a person as was not named in the
Premises of the Deed, it is but a Nugation: As if he had Leased to J.S.
Habendum to the Moon for certain years, there the Habendum to that thing is a
Nugation, and void; and therefore then if the words be in the Premises, that
he Leaseth to J.S. for 20 years, and does not say, that he shall have it for 20
years, it shall be intended, that the person named in the Premises shall have
it, for the Habendum waits upon the Grant before; and when he gives an Estate
in the Habendum without limiting of the person in it, then the person named in
the Premises shall have it; and then when he names a strange person who was
not named before in the Premises, or which has no Capacity, as the Moon, or
such like who are not in rerum natura, as his Executors of the Lessee, or his
Assigns, these persons or things named in the Habendum, are but Nugations, and
void; and then it is like unto the Case where no person is limited in the
Habendum: And where apt words are, there the Law shall construe them strong
against the Grantor; and therefore the Law couples the Habendum and the
Premises together, that the intent of the parties may (if by any means it may)
have a reasonable Construction. And therefore if a Man makes a Lease to two,
Habendum to one of them and a third person, there as to the third person he
gets nothing by the Habendum, because he was not named in the Premises, and
therefore the naming him in the Habendum is but a Nugation. And so here, the
naming of the Executors and Assigns by the Habendum, is but a Nugation, and so
there is no person named in it. But I conceive, that the Habendum, when the
years are expressed, and the Estate limited by it, shall have reference to the
person who is named in the Premises of the Deed, and so the Lease shall be
good to him to begin after the first Term expired. Harper, It appears that it
was the meaning of the parties, that he himself would not have any thing, but
that his Will was, That his Executors should have it, and the Law shall frame
his intent and meaning, and shall not subject the Law to his intent; and when
he does not so, but overthwarts the Law and frames such an Instrument, the Law
shall be first served, and not their meanings, when the same does not agree
with the Law. And therefore as to the Case which my Brother Manwood has put,
Where no person is named in the Habendum, by Construction of Law, he who is
named in the Premises shall have it: But when the Habendum makes express
mention of his intent what person shall have it, and another than was named in
the Premises, then if those cannot have it, the Estate limited shall not be
carried over to him who was named in the Premises. And as to the Case put,
where a Lease is made to two, Habendum to one of them, and a third person,
there I well agree, That as to the third person it is but a Nugation; and the
other two who are named with him in the Habendum, and have a Capacity to take
it, shall have it, although the other gets nothing; but that is not like to
the Case at Bar, for no person is named there. Manwood, If a Lease be made made
to J.S. except Green-Close, to J.D. who is a stranger, the Exception is good,
and J.D. shall have it. The Principal Case was Adjourned.

LXI. The Lord Windsors Case. Mich. 15 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
UPon an Evidence given to a Jury in the Kings Bench, in an Ejectione Firmae,
the Case appeared to be thus; That Sir Roger Lewknor, Knight, being seized in
Fee of the Manor of South Myms, made an Indenture, Anno 11. H. 8. by which
Indenture, he Leased the said Manor to 20 persons, to the use of Andrew
Windsor, afterward Lord Windsor, and Henry his Son, and the Survivor of them,
as long as any of the said persons named in the said Indenture should live: And
further Covenanted by the same Indenture, To stand seized of the said Manor,
To the use of the said Andrew and Henry, and the Survivor of them, during the
lives of any of the said Feoffees named in the same Indenture; which Deed was
made without Livery and Seisin; and reserved upon it an yearly Rent: and
afterward the Son died. And in 22 H. 8. A Fine was levied by a stranger upon a
Release to Andrew Lord Windsor; And afterward, 34 of Henry 8 Andrew Lord
Windsor made a Lease to one for years, and died; and made William and Edmond
his Sons his Executors: And afterward William his eldest Son being Lord
Windsor, 2 and 3 Phil. and Mary, made a Lease of the same Land unto another, to
begin after the first Lease ended: Which William died, and the Lord Windsor
that now is, accepted the Rent, and of late time agreed with one Vaughan, who
had married the Heir of Sir Roger Lewknor, for the Reversion in Fee; and
afterward the Lease made by Andrew Lord Windsor, 34 H. 8. ended in the 4th
year of the Reign of the Queen that now is; Whereupon, the second Lessee, that
is to say, the Lessee of William Lord Windsor, entered; and being ousted, he
brought the Ejectione firmae. And then, and yet one of the 20 Feoffees of Sir
Roger Lewknor is alive; so as the Estate of Cestuy que Vie, is not as yet
determined. And now the Question upon the first part of the Evidence is, If
this later Lease made by William Lord Windsor, be a good Lease or not? And who
shall be said Occupant? For when the Lord Andrew died, then the Lessee (as
Catline said) shall not be said in otherwise than according to his Lease, when
his occupation by Lease was lawful before: And he who shall be said Occupant,
shall have a Freehold; and if he should be Occupant, he should be in by a new
title. Then we are to see, If the Executors of the Lord which have the Rent,
and to whom the same is paid by the Lessee, shall be said Occupant? And he
conceived, That they should not, although that they enter, unless they claim
the Freehold at the time of their entry; for if they enter generally, it shall
be intended according to the Will, as Executors; and if he had granted his
Estate to another, there after his death, the Grantee shall be said to be in by
reason of his Grant, and not as Occupant; And so if he would devise his Estate,
the Devisee shall be in by reason of the Devise, and not as Occupant; Which
Case of Devise, Southcote denied, That he should not be in by reason of the
Devise, when his Estate determines with his death: But if the Devisee enters
by force of the Devise: he shall be in as an Occupant. And also Southcote
denied that which had been said, That the Lessee for years who holds the
Lands after the death of Andrew Lord Windsor, should not be an Occupant: For,
as he said, the Lessee being in possession after the death of the Lord Andrew,
should be said Occupant, and no other; for the Executors of the Lord could not
be Occupant by the having of the Rent, because they had not the possession of
the Land; for none shall be Occupant, but he who is in possession. Whiddon
said, That if the first Lease made by Andrew Lord Windsor, was now in esse, and
that an Ejectione Firmae was brought upon that, that the Lessee ought to aver,
That some of the Feoffees for whose lives, etc. were then living. Southcote, If
a Praecipe quod reddat shall be brought, against whom shall it be brought,
against him in the Reversion, or against him in possession? And if it shall be
brought against the Tenant in possession, then he ought to have the Freehold;
for it cannot be brought, but against one who has a Freehold at the least: And
then if the Lord William Windsor had nothing in the Land, then how could he
make this Lease to the Plaintiff that now is, when the first Lessee continues
Occupant after the death of the Lord Andrew, during the life of Cestuy que Vye?
And as to the Fine, the Question did further arise, If the Lord Andrew Windsor
should have a Feesimple by that Fine? For being levied, (as Catline said) It
cannot be to the first Uses, because a Fine upon a Release, cannot be intended
to the use of any other but to him to whom it is levied, unless an use be
expressed in the Fine, or by another Deed: And upon a Fine levied upon a
Release made unto Tenant life by a stranger, the same is not a forfeiture of
his Estate; But if Tenant for life takes a Fine Sur Conusans de droit come
ceo, etc. the same is a forfeiture. And although a Fine levied by those who
have not any thing in the Lands, be void, Yet here it is not so; and it ought
to be pleaded specially, and showed, that he had not anything in the Land at
the time the Fine was levied, as Anderson said. And Catline said, That this
Fine was not without good advice, for the Lord Brook and others who were
learned in the Law, were of Counsel with the Lord Windsor in the levying of
this Fine, so as the intent was to settle the Feesimple in himself by the Fine,
and not that the first Uses should stand after that: And thereupon he put the
Case of Putnam and Duncomb, which has much Resemblance to this Case, which he
argued when he was Sergeant, and held the same Opinion as he holds now; And
therefore he said, That although the Purchase was but of late time of Vaughan
and his Wife, yet the Fee was in the Lord Windsor before, and this manner of
purchase was to no other end, but to discharge the Lands of Encumbrances, as
appears by the small sum which was paid, the Land being of a great yearly
value. And, as Vaughan confessed, he took this sum of Money, because that his
Council informed him, that the Feesimple was in the Lord Windsor before, and
that otherwise he would not have sold it at such a price. And he said, That
before that agreement, the Lord Windsor told him, that he had the Feesimple in
himself. Whereupon Vaughan asked him, Wherefore he paid the Rent? To whom the
Lord Windsor answered, That he paid the same during the lives of the Feoffees,
but after their deaths, he paid nothing; but notwithstanding that payment, that
the Feesimple remained in him, and that his Counsel advised him to pay the Rent
to the Heirs of Lewknor, who was the Wife of the said Vaughan. And Catline
said, That if a Fine be levied upon a Release, in a Scire facias against the
Conusor, he shall not plead, that the Conusor had not any thing in the Land at
time of the Fine levied. And he said further, That if a Disseisor be, and the
Disseisee levieth a Fine upon a Release, that thereby his Right is gone.

And Note; That as to the principal Case, Southcote was of Opinion, That the
Fee was not gained by the Fine levied by a stranger to him who had the Use
before the Statute of 27 H. 8. and that if no Feesimple was in the Lord
Windsor, at the time of the Lease made by him, that the Lease could not be
good, nor the Action maintainable. And because the Court was divided in
Opinions in both Points, Catline commanded the Jury to find a Special Verdict.

LXII. Mich. Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
NOte: That it was said by the whole Court, That if a Man delivers Money to
another Man to buy Cattle, or to Merchandise with, although that the Money be
sealed up in a Bag, yet the property of the Money is to the Bailee, and the
Bailor cannot have an Action for the Money, but only an Account against the
Bailee, although that he never buyeth the Cattle or other things, for the
Auditors upon the Account shall allow him the sum and such other allowances as
they shall think fit. And that a stranger takes away the Money, after the death
of the Bailee, or in his lifetime, the Bailor shall not have an Action against
the stranger, but the Executors of the Bailee, or the Bailee himself during his
life; And yet if the Bailee dies, no Action of Account lies against his
Executors, because the Testator had the property of the Moneys. And therefore
if he, who takes the Money from the Bailee, promises the Bailor, to pay him the
like sum of Money as the Bailee had received of him in his life, and as should
be truly proved by the Bailor; there, upon that Promise, an Action upon the
Case does not lie against him who took away the Money, as Catline said, In an
Action upon the Case brought by the Master of the Rolls, and another, who
supposed, that they delivered 100 l. to one Moore, and that he is dead, and
that the Money came unto the hands of the Defendant, and that thereupon he
promised to pay the like sum which might be proved that Moore had of the
Plaintiffs. It was holden, That the Action upon the Case did not lie.
Southcote, Justice, said, That although the property of the Money be changed as
before, and that no Account lies against a stranger; Yet when he has the
Money, and for that cause promises to pay it as before, it is reason, that an
Action upon the Case should lie upon his promise, although the Law will not
charge him nor the Executors upon an Account.

LXIII. The Lord Cromwells Case. Mich. 15 Eliz.
Dyer 321, 322. 2 Roll. 560, 561.
JEffery recited, That a Replevin was brought by Franklin; The Defendants made
Conusans as Bailiffs of the Lord Cromwell; because, that the said Lord was
seized of the Manor of North-Elmes; and that the Custom of the said Manor is,
That the Homagers have used to make Bylaws (when necessity shall be) within
the same Manor, and upon a pain and forfeiture, and that the Lord of the
Manor for the time being, might distrain in the Land of any for the
Forfeiture. And further says, That in Anno 6 of Ed. the 6th, the Homage then
(whereof Franklin the Plaintiff was one) made By-Law, That none should put his
Sheep to feed in the Pasture or Lands of the Lord upon a pain, etc. And that
the said Franklin, in the 13th year of the Reign of the Lady the Queen that now
is, had put his Sheep into the Pasture and Lands of the Lord to feed; and for
that they avow the taking in the right of the Lord Cromwell, for not payment of
the said Forfeiture: And Jefferies of Council with the Plaintiff, said, That
the Avowry, nor the Conusans were not good; For the Custom is, as they
themselves have showed, That the By-Law shall be made when necessity requires
(and without necessity a By-Law cannot be:) And it is not alleged here, That
there was a necessity at the time of this By-Law made; and then if there be no
necessity, they cannot make the By-Law. Also, it is not alleged, that there
were any Sheep there; And when a Custom is pleaded, it shall be pleaded stricti
juris. And at the Common Law, you may see diverse Cases, That when a Man is to
have one thing for the cause of another, that he must allege the thing for
which he must have it: As in 9 H. 6. Where an Abbot had granted to one, That he
should have Common, wheresoever the Cattle of the Abbot should go; there if the
Commoner will justify or make Avowry for his Common, he must aver that the
Beasts of the Abbot went then in such a place, Field, or Pasture; for if they
did not go there at the time that he justifies or avoweth, his Justification
or Avowry shall not be good: And there it was said by Babbington, Chief
Justice, That if a Man grants Common whenever his Cattle shall go in such a
Pasture, If the Grantor does never put his Cattle into the Pasture, the Grantee
shall not have Common there: and therefore he must say, That he put his Beasts
into the Pasture. And in 15 H. 7. in the Case of an Annuity granted until he be
promoted to a Benefice, in a Writ of Annuity brought, he must say, That he is
not promoted, etc. And if an Obligation be made to you, to you my Lord, for
Money, when J.S. shall return from Rome; you shall not have an Action upon the
Bond for not payment of the Money, without alleging, that J.S. is returned. See
33 H. 6. Hillary 's Case; And before the Statute of Quia Emptores terrarum, If
a Man had made a Feoffment to hold by Fealty, and the Guarding of his Castle,
In an Avowry for the Castle Guard, that there was then War, and so cause of
necessity; for in time of Peace he shall not be bound to Guard it. And so it
appears, 34 H. 8. Where a Feoffment was made before the Statute, to hold by
Fealty, and every year to marry a poor Maiden within the Manor, if he does
avow for not marriage, he ought to allege, that there was a poor Maid that
year within the Manor. So, if the Tenure be to repair a Bridge that is for the
Common wealth, and he and all others are to have advantage of it, yet the Lord
shall not avow for not repairing of it, without alleging, that the Bridge was
in decay. And so when the Tenure is to Cover his Hall, he shall not Avow,
without alleging, that his Hall needed Reparations. And so in the principal
Case, here he ought to allege, that there was a present necessity for making
of the By-Law; for it may be, that there was not any Sheep within the Manor
when the By-Law was made, and then there was no cause that it should be made.
And in the like manner as it has been said of the Common Law, That certainty
ought to be showed, so shall it be by the Statute Laws. As if Tenant for life
makes default, if one prays to be received for the default of the Tenant for
life, he ought to show that he has the Reversion, and that he brings his
Action by reason thereof: And as it has been said of the Common Law, and
Statute Law, so it shall be said of Custom; As in 44 E. 3 where the
Parishioners prescribe to make Bylaws, and that they made such an Ordinance,
That for every Acre of Land, or for every Beast, every one should pay for the
Reparations of the Church, etc. there it may be said in Avowry, that the Church
wanted Reparation. And so where a Tax and Levy is to make a Wall against the Sea; there if the party will justify the levying of the Tax or Levy, he must
say, That there was need of it, otherwise the same cannot be levied: But as to
the ability of a person, he shall be enabled by Intendment. As if an Obligation
be made by a Man or a Woman, in an Action brought upon the Bond, he shall not
be compelled to say, That the Man was of full age, or that the Woman was a
single Woman, for that shall be intended, until the contrary be showed: But by
Statute Law, if a Man pleads a Grant, it shall be otherwise. As upon the
Statute of 1 R. 3. If he plead a Feoffment or a Grant of Cestuy que Use, he
must plead, That he was of full age, out of prison, of sound memory, and within
the 4 Seas. And so where a Pardon was made in the time of King Ed. the 14th, to
all, but to those who were with Queen Margaret; there, if he will take
advantage of the Pardon, he must plead, That he was not with the said Queen.
And if a Man plead a Feoffment of J.S. at the Common Law, it shall be good; and
if he were within age, it shall be showed on the other side: But if a Man
pleads a Feoffment by Custom; and the other says, that the Feoffor was
within, age, and the Plaintiff replyeth, That an Enfant by the Custom may make
a Feoffment; the same is not good, but a Departure: for he ought to have showed
that at the beginning in his Declaration. And in 37 H. 6. Where a Man pleaded a
Devise, and it was showed, that the Devisor was within age; there the Plaintiff
need not say, that the Custom is, That an Enfant may devise; for that is a
Departure. Another matter of the Custom which they have alleged, is, That they
may make Bylaws for the better Ordering; and they have not taken averment,
that this Ordinance was either better or worse: and if it be not better, then
they have no cause to make the By-Law. If a Feoffment be made causa Matrimonii
praeloquuti, it shall not be intended, that the Feoffment was for any other
cause than Marriage: And if a Woman brings a Writ of Dower, and the Defendant
pleads a Lease for life made by the Husband, it shall not be intended that that
Lease was in allowance of her Dower according to the Statute, if it be not
expressly showed. And so, If Cestuy que Use in tail makes a Lease for life, it
shall not be intended that Cestuy que Vie is alive, unless a special Averment
be taken, That he is yet alive: And so here it does not appear; that this is
the better Order, nor that the Lands are several, or lie in Common, so as by no
means or Circumstance it can appear if it be the better or not. Another cause
wherefore the pleading is not sufficient, is, Because he says, Upon a pain of
Forfeiture to the Lord for the time being; and he has not alleged in fact,
that the Lord Cromwell, who was Lord of the Manor in Anno 6 E. 6. was Lord in
the 13th year of the Reign of the Queen that now is; and, without showing, that
shall not be intended. As in 7 H. 7. A Man pleads a Feoffment, and that J.S.
was seized, and did enfeoffe him, that is not good; but he ought to plead, that
he being so seized, made the Feoffment; for it shall not be intended, that his
seisin continued until the time of the Feoffment, without showing of it. And so
where a Man pleads, That J.S. was seized of a Reversion, granted it; he ought
to plead, And that he being so seized, granted it: And so where an Attornment
is pleaded; for if he was not seized at the time of the Attornment, the
Attornment was not good. And so where a Man will plead a Surrender, he shall
show, that he who Surrendreth, and he to whom a Surrender is made, were seized.
Quaere, If the one or the other were not seized, one of the Term, and the other
of the Reversion, whether the Surrender be not good. And 31 H. 6. If a Man will
plead a Lease by Feoffees to use, he shall say, And that so seized, they made
the Lease. And see 6, 7, 10, 11 H. 7. Where Cestuy que Use makes a Feoffment,
averment shall be taken, that at the time of the Lease that the Feoffees were
seized to the use of the Lessor. And because that here it is not showed, nor
alleged, that the Lord Cromwell is now Lord of the Manor, it shall not be so
intended: Also, for diverse other causes, I conceive, that the Avowry is
insufficient: For he has showed, that a By-Law was made, but does not show
when it was made, nor for what time it was to continue; And it is not showed,
Whether the same were made for the better ordering of the Lands which the Lord
held jointly, or in common with others, or which he held in his own Right
alone: And as to the Prescription, I conceive that the same is not good;
because it is against reason, and not ex rationabili causa: For if one Man
keeps the Law, and another Man breaks the Law, yet according as they have
alleged this Custom to be, he may be distrained who has not offended, and his
Cattle taken for the Offense done by the Cattle of another Man; and it is
against reason, that any one should be punished for the default or offense of
another: But the Custom of Borough English is good; and so is the Custom of
Gavelkind, because that every Son is as good a Gentleman as the eldest; and
therefore those Customs stand with Reason. And so in 5 H. 7. Where a Man
prescribes, That for the Pasture which the Beasts of the Tenant have taken in
his Lands in the daytime; that he have the Foldage of them upon his said Lands
in the Night to manure his Lands, is a good prescription, because the party
has for it Quid pro Quo. And so where a Man prescribes to have a Farthing of
every one who passes over his Land, the same is called Toll traverse, and is
good. And so in 7 H. 4. Where a Man prescribes in Common by reason of Vicinage,
it is good; for though it cannot be of Common Right, yet because each has Quid
pro Quo, it is good. And so is the Custom for Fishermen to dry their Nets upon
the Banks of the Lands of other Men lying upon the Sea Coasts, because it is
for the Common wealth; and every Man has an advantage by it, but if a Man
should prescribe to Foul there upon the Lands of another, that were not good.
Meade, contrary, That case is, as it has been put; and diverse Cases of the
Common Law, Custom, and Statute Laws, have been showed: And by common
Intendment, it is intended, that need does require the making of the By-Law;
for otherwise, they would not have made it; and there needs not any averment,
that there was need of it, for that shall be taken by intendment: As 19 E. 4. A
Man counts of the Grant of the next Avoydance, and the Count is good, without
showing, that that was the next Avoydance, but yet it would have been better,
if it had been expressed. And 21 H. 7. In Trespass, the first day of May, the
Defendant pleads the License of the Plaintiff; without showing, that it was for
the same Trespass: and yet it shall be intended, when he pleads a License for
the same day, that it was for the same Trespass. And as to the Case put upon
the Statute of 1 R. 3. it has been ruled otherwise; for it shall be showed on
the other side, that he was within age, as it appears by 10 and 13 H. 7. Also
he said, that the Court here shall intend, that there was a necessity
sufficient, without expressing of it; and if there was not, then it ought to be
alleged on the other side: As 15 H. 7. An Annuity is granted until he was
advanced to a Benefice, the Plaintiff shall not need to show it, but that shall
come on the Defendants part; And the Statute which is, That no Cattle of the
Plough shall be distrained where the party has other Cattle of which a
Distress may be taken, there the party needs not to allege, that he had other
Cattle, or other Goods. And as to that which has been said, That it was the
better Order, that needs not, for the Defendant himself was one of the makers
of the Order; and when Bylaws are made, they shall not extend but to the
Tenants within the Manor where they are made, and to such only as have Lands
there, and not to the Lands of others which are out of the Manor: and the
Defendant in this case shall not be received to say, but that this is a good
Custom and Order, because he is a party to it, and was the maker of it, and
that there was then a necessity for the making of it, for the better ordering
of the Lands; and that especially when as the Defendant himself was a party to
it: And as to that which is said, That Seisin is alleged in the Lord Cromwell
in 6 E. 6. and it is not alleged, that the Seisin did continue in him until
13th of this Queen; It shall be intended, that he continued seized until the
contrary be showed. As in 11 H. 7. A Man prescribed to have Common by reason of
the House, etc. The Avowant does not say, that he was seized of the House at
the time, etc. of the disseisin of the Common, because he once alleged Seisin
of the House, and that Seisin shall be intended to continue unto the time of
the disseisin. And so 10 H. 7. A Prior Domus and Ecclesiae de C. brought Waste,
and supposed, that it was to the disenheresin of the House, and did not say,
praedict. Domus; and yet it was good, and shall be referred to the said Priory:
And so here, when he says, that he was Lord, and that the By-Law was made as
before, and a penalty imposed, and a Distress taken by the Bailiff of the Lord
Cromwell, for not observing the By-Law, and payment of the sum assessed, all
being put together, makes a sufficient certainty, and that the Lord Cromwell
continued his Seisin of the Manor and Land: And as to that which has been
said, That the By-Law made, and the Custom alleged to distrain in the Lands of
any Man for the Offense of another, is not reasonable; and against the Law: To
that he said, That the Tenants here had authority to make Bylaws, and by their
consents have bounden themselves to the observing and performance of them, and
therefore shall not now be received to say, That the By-Law made by themselves
was against the Law. And he said, That the Customs in some places are, Where
there are Waste Lands, that they may make Bylaws, That if any Tenant or person
dig Turfs in the same Waste, that the Lord may distrain for such offense within
any place of the Manor, and the Cattle of any person. Quaere of it. The
Principal Case was Adjourned.

LXIV. Mountford and Catesbys Case. Mich. 15 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
AN Action upon the Case was brought by Mountford against Catesby; Dyer 328.
Vaugh. Rep. 120.
And the Plaintiff declared, That the Defendant covenanted, assumed and
promised in Consideration of a certain sum of Money to him paid; and in
Consideration of the payment of a Rent of certain Lands demised to the Lessee,
That he should peaceably and quietly enjoy the same, without Interruption of
any person, and he was ousted by a stranger; And the matter aforesaid was found
by special Verdict: And it was argued by Lovelace, Sergeant; and he prayed
Judgment for the Plaintiff: And he said, That there is a difference, when it is
said, that a Man shall hold and enjoy peaceably and quietly; As in Case where
one warrants Land, there if he be ousted by a stranger who has not any Title
to the Land, he shall have an Action of Trespass against him: But a Man by
word, or Covenant, may bind himself to that which he is not bound to do by the
Law. As, if the Covenant and Promise be, That he shall leave the Houses in as
good plight as he found them: there, although the Law does not bind the party
to re-edifie the Houses in case they be overthrown by tempest of Wind; or that
they be destroyed by Enemies; yet by his special Covenant he shall be bound to
re-edifie them. Meade, contrary, And that this promise shall not be taken
strictly against the Lessor, Hob. Rep. 35.
that he shall enjoy it against all persons, but only against all persons who
have Title, and not against those who have not any Title, because against them
he may have his remedy. And if a Man makes a Feoffment of his Lands with
Warranty, and covenants, that it is discharged of all Rents, 1 Roll. 434. 1
Inst. 389. a. 1 Len. 29.
there it shall not extend to Rent Services which are incident to the Lands of
Common Right: In 3 H. 7. 4. the Case was, The Condition of an Obligation was,
That the Obligor should make Appropriation of the Church of Dale such a day to
such a House, at his Costs and Charges discharged of Encumbrances; Roll. Tit.
Conditions.
there, although there was a Pension granted thereout to another, it was
holden, That the Obligee was not bounden to discharge it of that Pension; No
more than if a Man be bounden to make a Feoffment of his Land, there, although
that he charge the Land, yet he shall not forfeit his Bond: But if it were,
that he should make a Feoffment of his Land discharged, etc. it is otherwise;
but yet he shall not be bounden to discharge it of such things with which it is
charged by the Law. Barham, The words are precisely, That he shall enjoy it
without interruption of any person, so as be he interrupted by one that has
Title, or no Title, the Plaintiff has cause of Action. Manwood, What if the
words were, That he should enjoy it without Suit in Law? Meade, That shall be
intended of a lawful Suit: And in the principal case, although the Contract be
by words, yet it is upon a good Consideration; that is to say, Of a Fine and
Income, and upon the payment of the Rent: And therefore as Dyer said, When
Catesby the Son leased the Lands to Mountford, the now Plaintiff, and it
appeared that his Father, or a stranger, made claim to it, and thereupon he
made the promise as before, shall it be intended, that he should hold and enjoy
the Lands peaceably without interruption of them only who had Title? And that
he should not have his Remedy against the Defendant upon his promise, if a
stranger who had not Title did interrupt him? Truly, he shall have his remedy
against him: As if the Son had promised that he should enjoy it against his
Father; or else that in truth if it were the Land of the Father, shall it not
be intended, that the Son did presume that his Father should not interrupt his
Lessee? And that he would so deal with his Father, that he should not interrupt
him: and it may be, that upon the presumption of the good will of his Father,
or that he had treated with him, or compounded with him; that for these, or the
like causes, the Son made the promise aforesaid: And if the Father had not any
Right or Title to the Land, should not the Lessee have his Action against the
Defendant, if the Father did interrupt him, for this unlawful Interruption?
Truly, Yes; For by the words it is to be supposed, That the Son would so deal
with his Father, that the Lessee should enjoy and hold the Lands without any
manner of interruption. Mounson, You have well tasted the Opinion of the Court
upon this matter before, and now you hear our Opinions again. Manwood, As I
said the other day, Cannot an Hostler take upon him, that the Goods of his
Guests which are within his Inn, shall be safe, and charge himself further
therewith, than he is chargeable by the Custom of the Realm, and to be
chargeable against every one that takes them away? Truly, I conceive he may.
Harper, The common making of Assurance is, That he shall enjoy them without any
lawful Interruption: 1 Roll. 429.
And if the Law, upon the general words of Enjoying without Interruption,
should be intended but of lawful Interruptions, It were in vain to have this
word ( Lawful) in the Deed, etc.

AN Action of Debt was brought against one upon an Obligation* It was upon an
Apprentice Bond; The Condition of which was, That if such a one did become the
Apprentice of the Obligee, and transport his Merchandises beyond the Seas, and
make a Retorn of them, and makes an Account unto the Obligee, and pays the
Moneys upon his Account within a certain time, that then, etc. And afterward,
the Obligee does release by Deed to the Servant the Apprentice, and not to the
Obligor: And in Debt brought against the Obligor, he pleaded the Release. And
it was said by the Lord Dyer, and by the whole Court, That by the Release to
the Servant, the Obligation was saved, if the Release were made before any
forfeiture; or that the Servant or Apprentice had broken any of the Conditions,
or any point according to the Covenants: but if it was made after any of them
was broken, then such a Release to the Servant, did not dispense with the
Obligation which was made by the stranger, because an Obligation once
forfeited, cannot be saved by any Act or Release made or done to a stranger.

LXVI. Mich. 15 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
IN a Quare Impedit brought by the Patron against the Archbishop of York, and
the Incumbent, Dyer 327.
who was in by the Collation of the Archbishop, after the death of the
Incumbent of the Patron. It was said by the Lord Dyer, That of an Avoydance by
Resignation, or Deprivation, the Patron shall have 6 months time, after notice
thereof given unto him, to present his Clerk, because it may be done secretly,
in the Chamber of the Ordinary; and therefore in such case the Law is, That the
Bishop is to give notice of it to the Patron, before he be bound to that
knowledge of such a Presentment; as it appears by the Case in 1 H. 7. 4. And
Low, the Prothonotary said, That so is the Roll of the same year, where the
Issue was, Whether the Patron had 6 months after the notice? And then the Lord
Dyer said to the Prothonotary, Show me the Roll at another day, that I may
compare it with my Book. But if the Church become void by death of the
Incumbent, there the Patron is to take notice of it at his peril, without any
other notice thereof to be given him by the Ordinary: And he said, That if the
Patron does present his Clerk a Week before the 6 months be ended, and the
Ordinary does refuse the Clerk for Inability, because he is unlearned, and then
the six months pass before he presents another, after the six months after
the death of the Incumbent; in such case, the Bishop shall have the Collation
of the Clerk, because it was the folly of the Patron, that he did not present
his Clerk before, so as the Ordinary might examine him; and that thereupon if
he be found to be unable, that he might present another Clerk to the Ordinary
within convenient time, and for that cause is the 6 months given to the Patron,
that he provide another Clerk in the mean time. And there is a good Case in 14
H. 7. which was long debated. Where the Ordinary commanded the Clerk to come to
him afterward to be examined, because the Ordinary had then other business.
And there the better Opinion of the Book is, That it was a good Plea for the
Ordinary, That he did not refuse the Clerk, but that the Clerk did not return
to him again, and that the 6 months passed, so as he made the Collation, and
that the Patron made his presentation too late, so as he had not convenient
time to examine him. Then in the Case at Bar, It was moved, That when the
Ability and Disability of the Clerk came in Question, by whom the same should
be tried; because in the Case here, the Bishop of York was a party to the Suit,
Whether by the Metropolitan of York, or by the Metropolitan of Canterbury. And
he said, That as he conceived, the Trial of the Ability should be by the
Metropolitan of York, and not of Canterbury: But he said, That if the party in
whom the disability was alleged was dead, so as he could not be examined, the
Trial of his Ability or Disability should be by the Country, as it appears in
the Book of 39 E. 3. Manwood, Justice, The Cure of Souls is to be regarded, and
therefore if an Enfant be to make a Presentation, the same shall not be stayed
for his Nonage; and therefore if in such case he does surcease, and shall not
present his Clerk, the Law which regards more the Cure of Souls than the
Enfancy, will permit that the Ordinary shall collate to the Church, if a
Presentment thereto be not made within the six months. And he said, That if the
Patron should present one but a week before the end of the six months, and the
Ordinary should refuse him for disability: If the Patron should have other six
months then next after, he might then likewise present an Enfant or other
disabled person to the Ordinary, and so detract the time by fraud, and so the
Lapse by such great fraud should never devolve to the Ordinary, and so the Cure
should be unserved; And so the Issue would be and arise upon the convenience of
the time. And as to that which has been said, concerning the Ability and
Disability of the Clerk, I conceive the same shall be tried by the Metropolitan
of Canterbury, and not by the Metropolitan of York. Mounson, to that intent;
and he said, There is a good case in 14 H. 7. 21. which is a short case, and
not the Case which has been vouched; by which it appears, that the
presentment that shall be within 6 months, shall be accounted from the time of
the Avoydance, and not from the time of the presentment, by the whole Court:
And there it is said, That the Ordinary shall give notice to the Patron, if he
be a Layman, of the Disability of the Clerk, but not if he be a Spiritual
person: But if the party Presentee be Criminous, of that the Patron shall take
as well notice as the Ordinary. And afterward, the Lord Dyer caused the Record
to be read, and it did not appear therein, at what day the Presentment was made
to the Ordinary; which ought to have been showed: for the great point of the
Case does rest here upon the time of the Presentment, if it were before a week
that the six months were ended or not. Also the Ordinary says in his Bar, That
the Clerk was insufficient, and that he gave notice to the Plaintiff, and that
Nullam idoneam personam praesentavit: And the Court said, That that was no good
manner of pleading; but it had been better, if it had been Nullam etiam
personam idoneam praesentavit, and the first form would be a Jeosail. Manwood
said That the time of the notice given to the Patron, ought to be alleged,
because if the Patron sends his Clerk within a month after the Avoydance, and
the Ordinary will not give notice to the Patron in the mean time; the same
shall not be any default in the Patron: And as to the notice given to the
Patron, he said the same was well pleaded, and it shall be intended that it was
given to the person of the Patron. And as to the words in the Declaration,
scil. tunc vacantem, they are but void words, because nothing is spoken before
of any time. And the Incumbent pleaded the same Plea, as the Ordinary pleaded.
And Dyer asked, If the Incumbent were Person impersonee, for that none should
plead that Plea, but he who is Parson in fact, and Incumbent.

LXVII. Mich. 15 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
THe Case was, That an Information was exhibited into the Court of Common
Pleas, for the Queen and the party, upon a Penal Law; And a Subpoena issued
forth against two: one of them was served with the Writ, and the other not; and
now, a new Subpoena was prayed against him who was not served: And Dyer,
Justice, conferred with his Companions and the Prothonotary, and demanded of
them, If the Plaintiff might Exhibit an Information in this Court? Who
answered, That he might; for this is a Court of Record, and the Statute Law
limiteth, That it may be exhibited in any of the Queens Courts of Record. Then
he demanded of them, If a Subpoena lay out of this place? And Whetley,
Prothonotary, said, That it did. Dyer said, It is a strange thing to have an
Attachment at the first day. Manwood said, In this Court it is the common
usage, upon an Audita Querela, to award a Venire facias against the Conusee.
Dyer, said to the Prothonotaries, Advise with your selves against the morrow,
What Process has been used to issue forth upon the Presidents of Information
which have been before this time, If a Subpoena shall be awarded. And
afterward it was said by Gaudy, who moved for it, That he might have a
Subpoena upon this matter.

LXVIII. Mich. 15 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
NOte: A special Verdict was found at the Bar, and the Issue was taken upon a
Traverse; And Dyer, Justice, said, That a special Verdict could not be taken
upon a Traverse, but precisely according to the Issue, and so it was agreed by
the whole Court here; but some Sergeants at the Bar did doubt of it.

LXIX. Mich. 15 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
IN an Ejectione firmae, the Case was thus: King Henry the 8th was seized of
certain Lands, and by his Letter Patents granted the same to Thomas Holt for
life, the remainder to John Holt his Son, who in truth was a Bastard; and the
Letters Patents were, Ex certa scientia, and mero motu, etc. And because the
Plaintiff did suppose, that the same was not a good Purchase, he took a Lease
from the Queen, of the Lands, intending to make void the Letters Patents,
because the Defendant was nullius filius. And what difference there was in such
a Case, in Case of the King and a Common Person, was moved to the Court by
Lovelace, Sergeant. Dyer, Justice, I conceive, That it is a good Purchase in
Law as well in the Case of the King, as in the Case of a Common Person. And see
to that purpose, 39 E. 3. and in this Case, If the King had granted the Land to
John Holt without naming him Son, the same had been a good Purchase: But if the
King had called him John, the Son of Thomas, without giving him a surname,
there such a Purchase should not be good, if he were a Bastard; because he has
not Nomen Cognitum, as where he has a surname: and a Man cannot purchase by
the Name of John only; and then if he be called John, the Son of Thomas, when
he is not his Son, it cannot be good. And such Case has here lately been
adjudged, Where the Lord Powis gave certain Lands to Thomas Gray his Son, by
him begotten upon the Body of Jane Orwell; and in truth the said Thomas was a
Bastard of the said Lord Powis, (and the name of Jane was not Orwell, but the
Daughter of one Punt; and the Mother of Jane, who was first married to Punt,
betwixt whom Jane was begotten, married with one Orwell;) and yet
notwithstanding that wrong Name, and that the said Thomas Gray was not the Son
of the Lord Powis, born of Jane Orwell, but of one Jane Punt; yet it was a good
Purchase and Gift to Thomas Gray, because it was his known Name. Manwood, As I
take it, the Letters Patents are Ex certa scientia, and ex mero motu; and then
the Kings Grant shall not be taken in such plight as the Grant of a Common
Person, void for incertainty, because that the King takes notice of the Person,
of what degree he is; and in the Kings Case, where he takes knowledge, by the
words, Ex certa scientia, there all matter of uncertainty shall be avoided and
made good; but not matter which is not true: And for uncertainty, he said,
Where a thing may be taken two ways, there without the words, Ex certa
scientia, etc. the best shall be taken for the King, and strongest against the
Patentee. But by Dyer; by the words, Ex certa scientia, etc. that incertainty
is saved, and shall be taken strong for the Patentee; and if it can any ways be
taken for him, then the Patent shall not be void: and then when in the
principal Case, there is the word (Son,) and the word (Son) may be taken two
ways, either for a base Son, or a true Son; there by the words, Ex certa
scientia, the King takes upon him to know in what manner he is Son; and a base
Son is a Son Quodam modo, so as the Letters Patents shall not be false: But
where the King, in his Letters Patents recites a thing which is false, that
shall not make the Patent good, although the words be, Ex certa scientia, et
mero motu.

NOte; It was agreed by the Court, That if a Man in a Replevin pleads, and
they are at Issue, and the Jury is charged, and gone from the Bar, and returns
to give their verdict, and the Plaintiff be nonsuit, their retorn
irreplevisable shall not be awarded, as in case if a verdict had been given;
But the party may have a Writ of second Deliverance, as well as if he had been
nonsuit before declaration or appearance.

LXXI. Trin. 15 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
THe Case was; The Husband levied a Fine of his Land, and died, and his Wife
within the 5 years after the death of her Husband, brought her Writ of Dower,
but did not pursue her Writ, until 6 years were past, and then she would have
revived her Suit. And Meade, Sergeant, demanded the Opinion of the Justices, If
the Wife should be barred of her Dower, or not? And by Manwood, Justice, it was
moved again, If they at the Bar did agree, That if a Fine be levied by the
Husband, and the Wife does not make her claim within the 5 years, if for that
she shall be barred? And he conceived, That she should not be barred; For he
said, That he who has Title to the Land at the time of the Fine levied, if he
does not sue within 5 years after his Title accrued, should be barred: But
where the Title accrues after the Fine, there he who has Title shall not be
barred by the 5 years; but he may come 30 years after, and make his Title and
Claim. But in the principal case he said, That if the Fine had been levied
after the death of the Husband, there the Wife should be barred, if she did not
pursue her Right and Claim within 5 years: And he agreed, That if the 5 years
be a Bar here, that then by the Wives suffering of her Writ of Dower to be
discontinued till after the 5 years were past, that she should be barred,
because vigilantibus and non dormientibus subveniunt Leges. Harper said, That
the Discontinuance should be no Bar unto her; For he said, That if a gift be
made to one in tail, the Remainder over, and Tenant in tail dies without
Issue, and he in the Remainder brings a Formedon in the Remainder within 5
years, and discontinueth it, yet it is no Bar, but that after the 5 years
ended, he may revive his Suit: Which Manwood denied: And then Dyer came into
the Court, and the Case was moved to him: And he said, That the not prosecuting
of the Action by the Wife, should be a Bar unto her: and that the Marriage
which was before the Fine, was the cause of Dower, although she could not come
to be endowed, until after the death of her Husband: And he said, That the Wife
could make no other to have her Dower, but only by bringing of her Writ of
Dower; and therefore if she did surcease her time until the 5 years were past,
that her new claim by her new Writ, would not revive the Ancient Claim, and
that therefore she should be barred; For she could not enter into the Land to
defeat the Fine: And he said, That as to the principal Case, That it was
adjudged, Anno 4 H. 8. And it was also said by the Court, That an Assignment of
Dower made to the Wife in the Court of Wards, was no sufficient claim of the
Wife; because she cannot have a Writ of Dower there; and there by this
surceasing of her demand of her Dower for the 5 years at the Common Law, that
she should be barred.

LXXII. Trin. 15 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
THe Case was; A Man made a Lease for years, and the Lessee Covenanted to make
Reparations; The Lessor granted the Reversion to another, and the Lessee for
years made his Wife his Executrix, and died: It was holden in this Case by the
Court, That the Grantee of the Reversion should not recover damages, but from
the time of the Grant, and not for any time before: But yet the Wife the
Executrix should be charged for the not Reparations as well in the time of her
Husband, as in her own time* And if she do make the Reparation, depending the
Suit; yet thereby the Suit shall not abate, but it shall be a good cause to
qualify the damages according to that which may be supposed, that the party is
damnified for the not repairing from the time of the purchase of the Reversion,
unto the time of the bringing of the Action. And it was said by Manwood, That
by the Recovery of the damages, that the Lessee should be excused for ever
after, for making of Reparations; so as if he suffer the Houses for want of
Reparations to decay, that no Action shall thereupon after be brought for the
same; but that the Covenant is extinct.

LXXIII. Easter Term. 15 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
LOvelace moved the Court, that in the Kings Bench this case was argued upon a
Demurrer there; A Feoffment was made by one Coxley, who took back an Estate for
life, the remainder to him who should be his Heir at the time of his death, and
to the Heirs males of his body begotten: And afterward, the Tenant for life
after the Statute of 32 H. 8. suffered a Recovery to be had against him, that
that Recovery was good as it was at the Common Law, Because the Statute does
not speak but that it shall not be a bar to him who has the Reversion at the
time of the Recovery, but this remainder was in Abeyance until the death of the
Tenant for life; and that in the same Court it was adjudged accordingly in an
Ejectione firmae; and because the same was a discontinuance, the Plaintiff had
here brought his Formedon in the Remainder; and therefore Lovelace prayed, That
they might proceed without delays, (because the Plaintiffs Title appears)
without Essoigns, and feigned delays: Which Dyer, Justice, conceived to be a
reasonable request, and that it should be well so to do; because, as he said,
This Court is debased and lessened, and the Kings Bench does increase with such
Actions which should be sued here, for the speed which is there: And he said,
That the delays here were a discredit to the Court; so as all Actions, almost,
which do concern the Realty, are determined in the Kings Bench in Writs of
Ejectione firmae, where the Judgment is, Quod recuperet terminum, and by that
they are put into possession; and by such means, no Action is in effect brought
here, but such Actions as cannot be brought there; as Formedons, Writs of
Dower, etc. to the Slander of the Court, and to the Detriment and Loss of the
Sergeants at the Bar. And Lovelace showed, That diverse mean Feoffments were
made, etc.

NOte: This Case was in Court: An Heir Female was in Ward of a common person,
who tendered to her a marriage, viz. his younger Son; and she agreed to the
Tender, and the Guardian died; The Heir married the younger Son according to
the Tender: The Executors of the Guardian brought a Writ de Valor Maritagii,
supposing the Tender by the Lord to be void by his death. But the Court was of
a contrary Opinion, because the Tender of their Testator was executed.

LXXV. Riches Case. Mich. 15 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
ELizabeth Rich brought a Writ of Dower against J.S. who pleaded, and Judgment
given for the Defendant, and afterward the Judgment was reversed. And she
brought a new Writ of Dower, and the Tenant pleaded, That he always was ready,
and yet is, etc. Against which the Demandant pleaded the first Record to estop
the Tenant. To which the Tenant pleaded, Null tiel Record. It was the Opinion of
the Court, That here the Demandant cannot conclude the Tenant by that
Replication, to plead, Null tiel Record; For the Judgment is reversed, and so no
Record, and it cannot be certified a Record. But if the Tenant had taken Issue
upon the plea of the Tenant absque hoc, that he was ready; the same might well
have been given in Evidence against the Tenant.

Note: That the Case was, That the Demandant after the death of her Husband
entered into the Land in Demand, and continued the possession of it 5 years; and
afterward the Heir entered; upon which she brought Dower. It was agreed in that
Case, That the Tenant needed not to plead, Tout temps prist. after his
re-entry; for the time the Demandant had occupied the same, is a sufficient
recompense for the Damages.

LXXVI. Vavasors Case. Mich. 15 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
NIcholas Ellis, seized in Fee of the Manor of Woodhall, Leased the same to
William Vavasor, and E. his Wife, for the life of the Wife, the remainder to
the right Heirs of the Husband; The Husband made a Feoffment in Fee to the use
of himself and his Wife for their lives, the remainder to his right Heirs: The
Husband died, the Wife held the Land, and did Waste in a Park, parcel of the
Manor: It was moved to the Court, If the Writ of Waste should suppose, that
the Wife held ex dimissione Nicholai Ellis, or ex dimissione of her Husband: It
was the Opinion of the Court, That upon this matter, the Writ should be
general, viz. that she held de haereditate J.S. haeredis, etc. without saying
any more, either ex dimissione hujus, vel illius. For she is not in by the
Lessor, nor by the Feoffees, but by the Statute of Uses; and therefore the Writ
shall be ex haereditate: It was also the Opinion of the Justices, That the Wife
here is not remitted, but that she should be in according to the Term of the
Feoffment. Note in this Case, The Waste was assigned in destroying the Deer in
the Park. And Meade, Sergeant, conceived, That Waste could not be assigned in
the Deer, unless the Defendant had destroyed all the Deer: And of that Opinion
also was Dyer. Manwood said, If the Lessee of a Dove-house destroyed all the
old Pigeons, but one or two couple, the same is Waste. And if a Keeper destroy
so many of the Deer, so as the ground is become not Parkable, the same is
Waste; although he does not destroy them all. See 8 R. 2. Fitz. Waste 97. If
there be sufficient left in a Park, Pond, etc. it is enough.

LXXVII. Mich. 15 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
AN Action upon the Case was brought against Executors; They were at Issue,
Upon nothing in their hands: It was given in Evidence on the Plaintiffs part,
That a stranger was bound to the Testator in 100 l. for performance of
covenants; which were broken; For which the Executors brought Debt upon the
Obligation, depending which Suit, both parties submitted themselves to the
Arbitrament of A. and B. who awarded, That the Obligor should pay to the
Executors 70 l. in full satisfaction, etc. and that the Executors should
release, etc. which was done accordingly. And it was agreed by the Court, That
by the Release, it shall be taken in Judgment of Law, That the Executors have
Assets to the value of the whole 100 l. And although the Executors were
compelled by the Award to make the release; yet it was their own act to submit
themselves to the Arbitrament.

LXXVIII. Mich. 15 Eliz. In the Court of Wards.
NOte: It was Ruled by Kellaway and Wilbraham in the Court of Wards, That where
the Kings Tenant of Lands holden by Knight service in Capite, made a Feoffment
of the same Land to the use of himself for life, and after to the use of his
younger Son in tail, the remainder to the right Heirs of the Feoffor, and died,
the eldest Son within age, That the Queen should have the Wardship of his body,
and of the third part of the Land; and when the eldest comes at full age, the
younger shall sue Livery, and pay Primer Seisin according to the rate of the
value of the whole Land, viz. of the third part, as in possession; and of the
two parts as a Reversion: For the remainder to the right Heirs of the Feoffor,
is in truth a Reversion. For the Feesimple was never out of him, because there
was not any Consideration as to that, nor any use expressed. And also because
that Livery shall not be by parcels, the younger Son shall not be suffered to
sue Livery of the third part presently, and respite the residue as to the two
parts in Reversion, until the Reversion fall, but shall sue Livery presently,
as well of the two parts in reversion, as of the third part in possession: And
if the eldest Son had been of full age, at the time of the death of his Father,
the younger Son should pay Primer Seisin as to the third part of the full value
of it for one year as in possession; and as to the two other parts, the moiety
of the value of a year as a Reversion. And at that time Breers Case was
vouched; which was, Oliver Breers, Tenant in Chief by Knights Service, made a
Feoffment in Fee to the use of himself for life, and after to the use of A. his
Son and Heir for life, and after to the use of the first begotten Son of A. in
tail, and after to the use of the second Son of A. etc. and for default of such
Issue, to the right Heirs of the Feoffor: Oliver died, the said A. his Son
being of full age: It was ruled by the said Council of the said Court of Wards,
That he should pay for his Primer Seisin, a third part of the Land in
possession, and two parts as a Reversion.

THe Case was; A Man was seized of a Pasture, in which was two great Groves, and
a Wood, known by the name of a Wood; And also in the same Pasture were certain
Hedge-Rowes and Trees there growing Sparsim, Leased the same by Indenture for
years. And by the same Indenture bargained and sold to the Lessee, all Woods
and Underwoods in and upon the Premises: And further, That it should and might
be lawful to the Lessee to cut down and carry away the same at all times during
the Term. Harper, Justice, The Hedge-Rowes did not pass by these words,
Hedge-Rowes sparsim. Dyer, The Hedge-Rowes shall pass, for the Grant is
general, All Woods. Mounson, contrary; For the words of the Grant may be
supplied by other words. It was moved further, If by these words, the Lessee
may cut them oftener than once? And by Harper, Manwood, and Mounson, He can cut
them but once. Dyer, contrary; And so it should be, if the words had been,
Growing upon the Premises. And this word (Growing,) although it sounds in the
present Tense, yet it shall be also taken in the future Tense, if the word
(tunc) had not been alleged; for it is a word of restraint. The Case which was
argued in the Chancery, 27 H. 8. where I was present, was such, The Prior of
St. John of Jerusalem Leased a Commandry; Provided, That if the said Prior, or
any of his Brethren there being Commanders, will dwell thereupon, then the said
Lease to be void. It was doubted, If that did extend to the Successors, for the
word (Being) is in the present Tense. And yet it was holden by Fitzherbert,
That it should be taken in the future Tense, and so extend to the Successors:
Otherwise, if the words had been (Nunc) Being.

LXXX. Mich. 15 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
A Man seized of Lands in Fee, devised, 1 Len. 101.
That his Wife should take the profits of his Lands, until Mary his Daughter
and Heir came to the age of 16 years; And if the said Mary died, That J.S.
should be her Heir. Manwood, The Daughter after she has attained the age of 16
years, shall have the Land in tail; For Devises ought to be construed according
to the intent of the Devisor, so far forth as any certainty with reason may be
collected, but no intent shall be taken against all reason and certainty. It is
certain, That the Daughter shall not have the Land in Fee; for that shall
descend to her without any Devise: And these words (If she dies) cannot be
intended a Condition; for it is certain she shall die. But if the words had
been, That after the death of Mary, J.S. should be his Heir; in such case, Mary
had had but an Estate for life, for there it is limited what Estate she should
have. And when it is said, J.S. shall be his Heir, it shall be meant his
Collateral Heir, so as the Estate tail remains in the Daughter. Mounson and
Harper, to the contrary, and that she shall have but for life. And by Mounson,
If Mary had been a stranger to the Devise, she should take nothing. And this
Case was put by Barham, Sergeant, A Man devises 100 l. to his youngest
Daughter, 100 l. to his middle Daughter, and another 100 l. to his eldest
Daughter; and that all these sums shall be levied of the profits of his Lands.
It was holden by the better Opinion of the Court in this Case, That the
youngest Daughter should be first paid, and then the middle, and then the
eldest Daughter; and that was said to be Coniers Case.

LXXXI. Mich. 15 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
THe Case was; The King granted to the Bishop of Salisbury, That he should have
Catalla felonum and fugitivor', and Fines and Amercements of all Tenants and
Resiants within the Manor of D. which Manor, the Bishop Leased for years, and
that the Lessee should have all profits and hereditaments within the same
Manor. Manwood, Justice, conceived, That the Lessee should have the Post
Fines: For all things have a being somewhere, although they be not visible; As
Rents, Fines, have their being in the Lands out of which they are issuing, and
that is in the Son, of a Fine levied of the Land within the Manor, which is
due by Land of him who ought to pay the Fine. And this Fine is due be reason of
the Land, therefore it is in the Land, or within the Land; i. e. the Manor.
For the King may distrain for the Fine as well in the same Land, as in the Land
of him who ought to pay it. Dyer doubted of it, and said, That the Bishop could
not distrain in the Land for this Fine, but should have it by allowance in the
Exchequer upon the Estretes; and if the party would not pay it, the Lessee
should have a Subpoena against him out of the Exchequer. And some were of
Opinion, That the Lessee could not have this Fine, 2 Len. 179. 4 Len. 234.
for that they were not Hereditaments within the Manor, but rather in the
Exchequer, or Court where the Record is.

LXXXII. Mich. 15 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
THe Case was; A Man seized of a Pasture, in which are two great Groves, and a
Wood, known by the name of a Wood; And also in the same Pasture there are
certain Hedge-Rowes and Trees there growing Sparsim; Leased the same by
Indenture for years: And by the same Indenture, bargained and sold to the
Lessee, all Woods and Underwoods in and upon the Premises: And further, That
it shall and may be lawful to the Lessee to cut down and carry away all the
same at all times during the Term. Harper, The Hedge-Rowes do not pass by these
words, for they are not known by the name of Woods, 14 H. 8. 2. contrary by
Manwood, For by such words, Hedge-Rowes pass. Mounson, contrary; For the words
of the Grant may be supplied by other Words. Dyer, The Hedge-Rowes shall pass,
for the Grant is general, All Woods. It was moved further, If by those words,
the Lessee might cut them a second time, or but once? Harper, Manwood, and
Mounson, He may cut them but once. Dyer, contrary; And so it should be, if the
words had been, Growing upon the Premises. And this word (Growing,) although
it sounds in the present Tense, yet it shall be also taken in the future Tense,
if not that the word (tunc) had been there; for that is a word of Restraint.
The Case was argued in the Exchequer Chamber, where I was present; which was,
The Prior of St. John's, Leased a Commandry; Provided, That if the said Prior,
or any of his Brethren there being Commanders, will dwell thereupon, then the
said Lease to be void. It was doubted, If that Proviso did extend to the
Successors; for the word, Being, is in the present Tense: And yet by the
Opinion of Fitzherbert, it shall be taken in the future Tense, and so extend to
the Successors: Otherwise, if the words had been, Now being.

LXXXIII. Mich. 15 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
A. Made B. his Executor, and died; Vid. le stat. 43 Eliz. cap. 8. Office of
Executors, 261.
B. to the intent to defraud the Creditors, refused to take upon him the
Executorship, but caused a stranger to take upon him Letters of Administration;
which stranger fraudulently gave the Goods of the Testator to B. Dyer, If the
gift be fraudulent, then by the Statute of 13 Eliz. the gift is void; and then
B. by the Occupation of the Goods, shall be charged as Executor of his own
wrong. Manwood, I conceive there is a difference, If one makes an Executor, and
another takes the Goods, but does no Act which concerns the Office of an
Executor, as paying of Debts; he is not Executor of his own wrong but a
Trespassor to him who is Executor in right: but if he does any Act which
belongs to the Office of an Executor, then he is Executor of his own wrong.
Dyer, That Case has been adjudged against you: and although the Books of 9 E.
4. and 22 H. 6. were vouched; Yet Judgment was given against the Opinion of
Manwood. It was the Case of one Stoke.

LXXXIV. Jackson and Darcyes Case. Mich. 16 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
IN a Writ de Partitione facienda, between Jackson and Darcy, the Case was;
Tenant in tail, the remainder to the King, levied a Fine, had Issue, and died:
In that case, It was adjudged, That the Issue was barred, and yet the remainder
which was in the King was not discontinued; For by that Fine, an Estate in
Feesimple determinable upon the Estate tail, did pass unto the Conusee.

LXXXV. Strowds Case. Hill. 17 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
IN a Replevin, the Case was, That Lands holden of a Subject, came to the
possession of the King by the Statute of 1 E. 6. of Chauntries, and the King
granted the Lands over: In that case, It was holden, That the Grantee shall
hold the Lands of the King according to the Patent, and not of the Ancient
Lord: But the Patentee shall pay the Rent by which the said Land was before
holden, as a Rent seck distrainable of Common Right to the Lord only and his
Heirs; scil. to him of whom the said Lands were before holden.

LXXXVI. Tresham and Robins Case. Mich. 17 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
TResham brought an Action of Debt upon a Recognizance against Robins; The
Condition of which Recognizance was, To stand to the Arbitrament of A. and B.
who made Award, That Robins should have the Land, Yielding and paying 10 l. per
annum; And that Tresham in further assurance, should levy a Fine to Robins of
the same Land, and upon that, Robins should grant and render to Tresham; which
is done accordingly: the Rent is behind, Tresham brought Debt upon the
Recognizance: The Defendant pleaded the special matter, with this per close,
Unde petit Judicium, if the Plaintiff should have Execution against him. And by
the Opinion of the whole Court, the Conclusion of the Plea is not good; For
here is not any Execution of the same Debt, but an Original Action of Debt
brought; in which case, he ought to have concluded Judgment Si actio. It was
further moved, If these words, Yielding and paying, make a Condition? And it
was agreed, That the words do amount to as much as, So as he pay the Rent: And
if a Man makes a Feoffment in Fee, Reddendo and salvendo 10 l. for years, the
same is a Condition. But in the principal Case, It is not a Condition; For it
is not knit to the Land by the Owner it self, but by a stranger; i. e.
Arbitrator: but it is a good Clause to make the same an Article of the
Arbitrament, which the parties are bound to perform, upon pain of forfeiture of
the Recognizance: Which Wray concessit; And that this Rent should not cease by
Eviction of the Land.

LXXXVII. The Earl of Westmerlands Case. Hill. 18. Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
THe Earl of Westmerland seized of a Manor, whereof the Demesnes were usually
let for three Lives by Copy, 2 Len. 152. 2 Brownl. 208.
according to the Custom of the Manor, granted a Rentcharge to Sir William
Cordell, pro consilio impendendo, for the term of his Life, and afterward
conveyed the Manor to Sir William Clifton in tail. The Rent is behind, Sir
William Cordell dies; Sir William Clifton dies, the Manor descended to Sir
John Clifton, who granted a Copyhold to Hempston; The Executors of Sir William
Cordell distrain for the Rent: And it was agreed by the whole Court, That the
Copyholder should hold his Copyhold charged. Vide inde, 10 Eliz. Dyer 270.
Windham, It has been adjudged, That the Wife of the Lord shall not be endowed
against the Copyholder, which Periam granted, and showed a reason thereof; For
the Title of Dower is not consummated before the death of the Husband, so as
the Title of the Copyholder was completed before the Title of Dower; But the
Title of the Grantee of the Rent is consummated before the Dower. Fenner
conceived, That the Executors could not distrain upon the Possession of the
Copyholder; and he argued, That this Case is not within the Statute of 32 H. 8.
For by the Preface of the said Statute, he conceived, That the Statute extended
but to those Cases, for which by the Common Law, no remedy was provided; but in
this Case the Executors by the Common Law might have had an Action of Debt,
Ergo. But Periam and Windham held the contrary; For this Statute intends a
further remedy for that mischief, viz. not only an Action of Debt, but also
Dissress and Avowry. See the words of the Statute, viz. distrain for the
Arrearages, etc. Upon the Lands, etc. which were charged with the payment of
such Rents, and chargeable to the distress of the Testator so long as the said
Lands continue, remain, and be in the seisin or possession of the said Tenant
in Demesne, who ought immediately to have paid the said Rent so being behind to
the said Testator; or in the seisin or possession of any other person or
persons claiming the said Lands only by and from the said Tenant by purchase,
gift, or descent, in like manner and form as their Testator might or ought to
have done in his life time. It was moved by Fenner, That here the Land charged,
does not continue in the seisin or possession of the Tenant; And here Sir J.
Clifton was issue in tail, and therefore he does not claim only by the Father,
but per formam Doni, and therefore he is not liable, Ergo, nor his Heir.
Shuttleworth contrary, Sir J. Clifton was chargeable, and he claims only from
them who immediately ought to have paid the Rent. And the Copyholder claims by
purchase from Sir J. Clifton, so he claims from Sir William Clifton the Tenant,
although he does not claim immediately. For if the Tenant ought to have paid
it, and he dies, and the Land descends to his Heir, and the Heir makes a
Feoffment, the Feoffee shall be charged within this Statute; although he does
not claim immediately: So where Land discharged descends from the Tenant who
ought to have paid it; and so from Heir to Heir. The Statute of 1 R. 2. is,
That all Grants, etc. shall be good against the Donor, etc. his Heirs, etc.
claiming the same only as Heirs to Cestuy que Use; Yet if Cestuy que Use grants
a Rentcharge, and his Feoffees are disseised, the Grant shall be good against
the Disseisor, and yet he does not claim only by Cestuy que Use. And although
Sir J. Clifton be Tenant in tail, and so claims per formam Doni, yet forasmuch
as the Estate tail comes under the Estate of him who grants the Rent, he shall
be subject to the charge: And this Statute extends not only to him who claims
by the Tenant, but also to the Heir of him, etc. And by Windham, and Rhodes,
The Copyholder does not claim only by the Lord, but he claims in also by the
Custom; but the Custom is not any part of his Title, but only appoints the
manner how he shall hold. The possession here is continued in Sir J. Clifton,
for the possession of his Copyholder is his possession; so as if the Copyholder
be ousted, Sir J. Clifton shall have an Assise; And so the strict words of the
Statute are observed, for the seisin and possession continue in Sir J. Clifton,
who claims only by Sir William Clifton, who was the Tenant in Demesne who ought
to pay the Rent. But Fenner said to that, That the seisin and possession
intended in the Statute, was the very actual possession, i. e. pedis
dispositio, and such a possession in which a distress might be taken, and that
could not be taken in a Freehold, without actual possession.

LXXXVIII. Owen and Sadlers Case. Hill. 18 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
10 Co. 96.
A Lease was made to A. for life, the remainder to B. in tail, the remainder to
the right Heirs of B. who bargains and sells all his Estate, or levies a Fine
with Proclamations of it to D. A. commits Waste: It was holden by the Court,
That D. shall not punish him in an Action of Waste, for nothing passes to him
but during the life of the Grantor; scil. as to the remainder in tail, in
respect of which Estate, the Action of Waste is only maintainable: for although
that the Feesimple passes to the Grantee, or Conusee, yet in respect of that,
an Action of Waste is not maintainable, until the Estate tail be spent.

LXXXIX. Mich. 18 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
THe King seized of a Manor, 2 Cro. 53, 123. Yel. 90, 91. 1 Cro. 240. 2 Roll.
371. Hob. Rep. 242.
to which an Advowson is appendant; A stranger presents, and his Clerk is in by
6 months; The King grants the Manor with all Advowsons appendant to it, to B.
The Incumbent dies: In this case, It was holden by the Court, That the Grantee
might present; For the Advowson was always appendant, and the Inheritance of
the same passed to the Grantee; for it was not made disappendant by the
Usurpation: But the Patentee shall not have a Quare Impedit of the first
disturbance, for that presentment did not pass unto him, being a thing in
Action, without mention of it in his Grant: And if the Plaintiff brings a Quare
Impedit of the second Avoydance, he shall make his Title by the presentment of
the King, not making mention of the Usurpation; Yet if the Bishop present by
Lapse in the case of a common person, he ought to make mention of it.

XC. Mich. 18 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
IN an Ejectione firmae, upon an Evidence, the Case was this; The Bishop of
Rochester, 4 E. 6. Leased to B. for years, rendering Rent; and afterward
granted the Reversion to C. for 99 years, rendering the ancient Rent; Habendum
from the day of the Lease, without impeachment of Waste; which Grant was
confirmed by the Dean and Chapter, but B. did not attorn. And in default of
Attornment, It was holden by the whole Court, That the Lease was void: For it
was made by way of grant of the Reversion, and to pass as a Reversion. But by
Catline, If the Bishop had granted the Reversion, and also demised the Land for
99 years, It should pass as a Lease to begin first after the former Lease
determined. And as to the Attornment, it was given in Evidence, That B. after
the notice of the Grant to C. had speech with C. to have a new Lease from him,
because he had in his Term but 8 years to come; but they could not agree upon
the price. And it was the Opinion of the Justices, That the same was an
Attornment, because he had admitted the said C. to have power to make to him a
new Lease. Also the said B. being in Company with one R. and seeing the said C.
coming toward him, said to the said R. See my Landlord, meaning the said C.
Bromley, Solicitor, The same is no Attornment, being spoken to a Stranger.
Barham, contrary; Because that C. was present. And it was holden to be a good
Attornment: But if that Attornment was not before that the Bishop was
translated to Winchester, the Lease should be void. And although the
Confirmation of the Dean and Chapter was before the Attornment, so as no Estate
was vested in C. yet it was good enough; For an assent of the Dean and Chapter
is sufficient, be it before or after; as it was holden by Catline, Southcote,
and Whiddon. But Wray contrary.

XCI. Norwich and Norwich's Case. Trin. 18 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
HEnry Norwich was bound by Obligation to Simon Norwich, upon Condition, To
stand to the Award of J.S. who awarded, That the said Henry should pay to Simon
150 l. at such a day. And that the said Henry should find 3 Sureties to be
bounden with him to the said Simon for the payment of another sum of Money to
the said Simon. In Debt, upon this Obligation, Henry pleaded, As to the 150 l.
payment; and as to the other point, That he was always ready to become bounden,
etc. And as to the finding of Sureties, he demanded Judgment; for that, as to
that, the Arbitrament is void. See 22 H. 6. 45. 17 E. 4. 5. 21 E. 4. 75. It was
holden, That in such a case of such Award to find Sureties, the Defendant is
not to find Sureties, but is only to tender his Obligation. And of that
Opinion, was the whole Court, Because it was an Act to be done by a stranger to
the Award. But if the Award had been of an Act to be done to a stranger, by him
who was party to the Award, then the Award had been good: But if the stranger
will not accept of the Moneys awarded, his Obligation is saved. So if the Award
be, That one of the parties to the Award shall discontinue a Suit, which he
has against another; If the Court where the Action is depending, will not
suffer the discontinuance of it, the Award is performed: And in the principal
Case, It was ruled accordingly.

Note; The same day another Case was in the same Court, Between Dudley and
Mallery: The Condition was, to perform an Award, etc. The Defendant pleaded
performance of the Award. The Plaintiff assigned the breach of the Award in
this, because the Award was, That the Servant of Mallery should pay to the
Servant of Dudley 5 l. which the Defendant had not paid. It was the Opinion of
the Court, That the Bond was not forfeited, for the Servants utriusque are
strangers to the Submission. But if the Award had been, That Mallery should pay
to the Servant of Dudley 5 l. it had been good, for that Mallery is a party to
the Submission, etc.

XCII. Rivers and Pudsey's Case. Hill. 19 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
JOhn Rivers, Alderman of London, brought a Writ of Account against Pudsey; who
said, That at the time, etc. and now, he is the Plaintiffs Apprentice; and
demanded Judgment, etc. And it was holden by Wray, Justice, That it is no Plea:
for although an Apprentice cannot be charged by this Action, for ordinary
Receipts upon his Masters Trade; yet upon collateral Receipts, which do not
concern the ordinary Trade of his Master, he shall be charged as well as
another. See 8 E. 3. tit. Acc. 94. And, F.N.B. 119.

XCIII. Potkins Case. Hill. 19 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
IN Debt upon an Obligation by Potkin; The Defendant pleaded, That he himself
borrowed of one Watson a certain sum of Money, paying for the forbearance
thereof excessive Usury; And that the Plaintiff was bound with the said
Defendant to the said Watson, for the payment thereof; and that he himself by
this Obligation upon which the Action is brought, was bound to the said
Plaintiff to save him harmless against the said Watson, etc. And because that
this Bond was a Counter-Bond for the payment of Excessive Usury, etc. And it
was holden by Manwood, That the same was a good Bar; for here, the Plaintiff
when he was impleaded upon the principal Bond, might have discharged himself
upon this matter, and therefore his Lachess shall turn to his prejudice; and
therefore the Issue was joined upon the excessive Usury.

XCIV. Abrahall and Nurse's Case. Hill. 19 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
JOhn Abrahall brought a Writ of Right-Close against John Nurse, in the Court
of George Earl of Shrewsbury, and made protestation to prosecute that Writ in
the form and nature of the Writ of the Lady the Queen, of Assise of Novel
disseisin, at the Common Law, and made his Plaint accordingly. And afterward
the Assise was taken, who spoke for the Plaintiff; Whereupon Abrahall had
Judgment to recover. After which, Nurse brought a Writ of False Judgment, and
assigned Error in this. That whereas the said Writ of Right-Close was directed
to the Bailiffs of George Earl of Shrewsbury of his Manor, etc. that the said
Bailiffs should do full Right, etc. that it appears by the Record, that the
Plea was holden before the Suitors, and not before the Bailiffs of George Earl
of Shrewsbury. For all the Precepts in the Plea aforesaid, are, Quod sint hic
ad proximam Curiam coram Sectatoribus tenend. An other Error was in this, and
false Judgment was given therein, because that the Roll is, Praeceptum est
Ministro Curiae praedict. that he cause to come 12 Free and lawful Men, etc.
videre illud tenementum, etc. and nomina eorum imbreviare, etc. and the
Minister of the Court returned 12 Recognitors of the Assise aforesaid; whereas
by the Law of the Land, 24 Recognitors in a Plea of Land ought to be returned.
But notwithstanding that these Exceptions were taken; Yet upon due
consideration of the Court, notwithstanding these Exceptions, the Judgment was
affirmed. See the Record, Mich. 17 and 18 Eliz. Rot. 1301.

XCV. The Master and Scholars of Linckfords Case. Hill. 15 Eliz. In the Common
Pleas.
IN an Ejectione firmae, the Case was; That the Master and Scholars of
Linckford were seized of the Manor of Haldesley in the Town of Laberhurst;
which Town extended into the County of Sussex, and also in the County of Kent;
and they made a Lease to one Clifford of all their Lands in the Town of
Laberhurst, except the Manor of Haldesley; whereas in truth they had not any
Lands in the said Town, but the said Manor: And the Ejectione firmae was
brought of that Manor in Kent; and from thence the Visne came, and all the
special matter aforesaid was found by Verdict: And Exception was taken to the
Verdict, because they have found generally, That the Master and Scholars had
not any thing in the said Town of Laberhurst, but the said Manor: Whereas,
they ought to have said, That they had not any thing in the said Town in the
County of Kent: For they could not take notice what Lands the Master and
Scholars had in that part of the Town which was in the County of Sussex. And of
that Opinion the whole Court seemed to be. But Quaere of it; for it was
adjourned.

XCVI. Hind and Lions Case. Mich. 19 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
Post. 70. Dyer 124. 2 Len. 11.
IN Debt by Hind, against one as Son and Heir of Sir John Lion, who pleaded,
Nothing by descent, but the third part of the Manor of D. the Plaintiff
replied, Assets; and showed for Assets, That the Defendant had the whole Manor
of D. by descent: Upon which they were at Issue. And it was given in Evidence
to the Jury, That the said Manor was holden by Knights-Service; And that the
said Sir John the Ancestor of, etc. by his Will in writing, Devised the whole
Manor to his Wife, until the Defendant his Son and Heir should come to the age
of 24 years; And that at the age of his Son of 24 years, his Wife should have
the third part of the said Manor for her life, and his Son should have the
residue: And if that his said Son do die before he come to his said age of 24
years without Heir of his body, that the Land should remain to J.S. the
remainder over: The Devisor died, The Son came to the age of 24 years. The
Question was, If the Son had an Estate in tail, for then for two parts he was
not in by descent. And it seemed to Dyer and Manwood, That here was not any
Estate in tail; for no tail shall rise, if not that the Son die before his said
age, and therefore the tail shall never take effect: and the Fee-simple does
descend, and remain in the Son, unless that he dies before the age of 24
years; and then the Estate vests with the remainder over: but now having
attained to the said age, he has the Fee, and that by descent of the entier
Manor, and then his Plea is false, That but the third part descended. And a
general Judgment shall be given against him as of his own Debt; And an Elegit
shall issue forth of the moiety of all his Lands, as well those which he has
by descent from his Ancestor, as his other Lands; And a Capias also lies
against him. But Manwood, Justice, conceived, That if a general Judgment be
given against the Heir by default, in such cause, a Capias does not lie,
although it lies in case of a false Plea. Dyer, contrary, And the Writ against
the Heir is in the debet and detinet; which proves, That in Law it is his own
Debt. And he said, That he could show a President, where such an Action was
maintainable against the Executors of the Heir.

XCVII. Mich. 19 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
THe Case was; A. seized of Lands in Fee, 2 Len. 154. Hob. 285. Dyer 329.
by his Will in writing, granted a Rentcharge of 5 l. per annum out of the
same to his younger Son, toward his education and bringing up in Learning: The
Question was, If in pleading, the Devisee ought to aver, That he was brought up
in Learning? And it was holden by Dyer, Manwood, and Mounson, Justices, That
there needs no such Averment; for the Devise is not Conditional: and therefore
although he be not brought up in Learning, yet he shall have the Rent: And the
words of the Devise are, Toward his bringing up. And the Devisor well knew,
that 5 l. per annum, would not and could not reach to maintain a Scholar in
Learning* Diet, Apparel, and Books. And this Rent, although it be not
sufficient to such intent, yet the Son shall have it. And by Dyer, Three years
past, such Case was in this Court, scil. Two were bounden to stand to the Award
of certain persons; Who awarded, That the one of them should pay unto the other
20 s. per annum during the Term of 6 years, toward the education and bringing
up of such an Enfant; and within two years of the said Term, the Enfant died,
so as now there needed not any supply toward his Education: Yet it was holden,
That the said yearly sum ought to be paid for the whole Term after: For the
words, Toward his Education, are but to show the intent and consideration of
the payment of that sum; and are not the words of a Condition.

XCVIII. Mich. 19 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
IN a Quare Impedit; The Plaintiff declared, That the Defendant was seized in
Fee of the Manor of Orchard, alias Lydcots-Farm, to which the Advowson is
appendant, and presented such a one, etc. And afterward leased to the
Plaintiff the said Manor per nomen of the Manor of Orchard, alias
Lydcots-Farm, with the appurtenances for 21 years, and the Church became void,
etc. And the truth of the Case was; That there is the Manor of Orchard, and
within the said Manor, the said Farm called Lydcots Farm, parcel of the said
Manor, and the Lease was of the said Farm; and not of the said Manor, and so
the Advowson remained to the Lessor, as appendant to the Manor: In this Case,
It was moved, What thing the Defendant should traverse: Dyer, He shall say;
That the Advowson is appendant to the Manor of Orchard, absque hoc, that it is
appendant to the Farm of Lydcots: But it seemed to Manwood, That the Defendant
shall say; That the Advowson is appendant to the Manor of Orchard, and that
the Farm of Lydcots, is parcel of the said Manor, and that he Leased to the
Plaintiff the said Farm, with the appurtenances, absque hoc, that the Manor of
Orchard, and the said Farm, are all one; For if he traverse the Appendancy to
the Farm of Lydcots, then he confesses, That the Manor and Farm are all one,
etc. But Dyer doubted of it.

XCIX. Kirlee and Lees Case. Mich. 19 and 20 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
IN Action upon the Case upon Assumpsit, the Plaintiff declared, That the
Defendant in Consideration, that the Plaintiff would marry the Daughter of the
Defendant, did promise to find to the Plaintiff and his said Wife convenient
apparel, meat and drink for themselves and two servants, and Pasture also for
two Geldings, by the space of 3 years, when the Plaintiff would require it: And
further showed, That Licet the Plaintiff had married the Defendants Daughter,
and that he had required the Defendant to find, ut supra, etc. the Defendant
refused, etc. The Defendant said, That he promised to find meat, drink, and
apparel for the Plaintiff and his Wife for 3 years, absque hoc, that he
promised to find meat and drink for two servants, and Pasture for two Geldings:
The Plaintiff Replicando, said, That the Defendant did promise to find, etc.
for 3 years next following. Upon which they were at Issue, and found for the
Plaintiff. It was moved in Arrest of Judgment, That here is no Issue joined;
For the Plaintiff has declared upon a promise to find, etc. for 3 years, when
the Plaintiff will that require. The Defendant has pleaded a promise to find
apparel, meat and drink for the Plaintiff and his Wife for 3 years, absque hoc,
that he promised for two servants, and two Geldings; and now the Plaintiff
Replicando, says, That the Defendant assumed for 3 years next following; so
here is another Assumpsit in the Replication, than that whereof the Plaintiff
declared, and so the Plaintiff has not joined Issue upon the Assumpsit
traversed by the Defendant, and so there is no Issue joined, for the Defendant
denies the Assumpsit whereof the Plaintiff has declared. And the Plaintiff in
his Replication has affirmed another Assumpsit than that whereof he has
declared; and that is not helped by the Statute of Jeofails; For it is not a
mis-joyning of Issue, but a not joining of Issues; and that was holden by the
Court, to be a material Exception. And the Lord Dyer conceived, That here is a
Departure; for the Plaintiff in his Replication has alleged another promise,
than that whereof he declared. Another Exception was, Because that the
Plaintiff had not averred in facto, that he had married the Daughter of the
Defendant, but by an Argument Implicative (Licet;) but that Exception was
disallowed; For that the word (Licet) is not a bare Implicative, but it is an
express Averment; And so it was said, Plow. 127.
it had been ruled before. See 2 Mar. Plow. Com. 127, 128. Buckley and Thomas
Case.

That the Lessee should not grant over the Land at Will, or otherwise: He
devised the same to his Executors, who accepted the same only as Executors, and
not as Devisees: And yet it was the Opinion of the Justices, That the Condition

Land. 2 Roll. 684. 1 Roll. 24. 9 Co. 94. Styles Rep. 304, 305, 405. Hutton Rep.

CI. Hodgson and Maynards Case. Hill. 19 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
NOte: It was said by the Justices in this Case, That if an Executor promises
to pay a Debt when he has not Assets, no Action upon the Case lies against
him upon such promise: but contrary, if he has Assets. And so it was holden,
That if the Heir has nothing by descent, an Action upon the Case will not lie
against him upon such a promise made.

CII. Mich. 20 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
Co. 3. Inst. 1. Stat. 5. Eliz. 2 Len. 12.
AN Action upon the Statute of 5 Eliz. of Perjury, was brought by three; and
they declared, That the Defendant being examined upon his Oath before
Commissioners, If a Surrender was made at such a Court of such a Manor of a
Copyhold, to the use of A. and B. Two of the Defendants swore, That no such
Surrender was made, etc. Exception was taken to the Declaration, because that
the certainty of the Copyhold did not appear upon the Declaration: For the
Statute is, That in that case the party grieved shall have remedy; so as it
ought to appear in what thing he is grieved, Quod fuit concessum per totam
Curiam. Another Exception was taken, because that the Action in such case is
given to the party grieved. And it appears upon the Declaration, That the
surrender in the Negative deposing, of which the perjury is assigned, was made
to the use of two of the Plaintiffs only; and then the third person is not a
party grieved; For he claims nothing by the surrender; and therefore, and
because the two parties grieved have joined with the third person not grieved,
It was the Opinion of Wray and Southcote, Justices, That the Writ should abate.

CIII. Mich. 20 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
1 Len. 263.
NOte: It was said by Dyer and Manwood, Justices, If one be condemned in an
Action upon the Case or Trespass, upon Nihil dicit, or Demurrer, etc. And a
Writ issues to enquire of the Damages, and before the Retorn of the Writ, the
Defendant dies; The Writ shall not abate for that; For the Awarding of the
said Writ is a Judgment. And Manwood said; In a Writ of Account, the Defendant
is awarded to Account, And the Defendant does Account, and is found in
arrearages, and dies; The Writ shall not abate, but Judgment shall be given,
That the Plaintiff shall recover, and the Executor shall be charged with the
Arrearages; and yet Account does not lie against them.

CIV. Mich. 20 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
2 Len. 52. 2 Len. 282. Post. 92.
IN an Action upon Escape, the Plaintiff is Nonsuit. It was holden by the
Justices, That the Defendant in that case shall not have Costs, by the Statute
of 23 H. 8. Note, The words in the Statute, upon any Action upon the Statute,
(for any offense or wrong personal supposed to be done immediately to the
Plaintiff) Notwithstanding this Action is, Quodam modo an Action within the
Statute; scil. by equity of the Statute of Westminster. 2. which give expressly
against the Warden of the Fleet; Yet properly it is not an Action upon the
Statute; for that in the Declaration in such Action, no mention is made of the
Statute. Which, see the Book of Entries, 169, 171. And also here there is not
supposed any immediate personal Offense, or Wrong to the Plaintiff: and an
Action upon the Case, it is not, For then the Writ ought to make mention of the
Escape, which it does not here; And yet at the Common Law before the Statute of
Westminster. 2. An Action upon the Case lay upon an Escape; And so by the opinion of
Dyer, Manwood, Mounson, Justices, Costs are not given in this case; and Manwood
said; That upon Nonsuit in an Action upon the Statute of 8 H. 6. The Defendant
shall not have Costs, 1 Len. 282.
For that the same is not a Personal Wrong, For the Writ is Disseisivit, which
is a real tort.

CV. Mich. 20 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
IN Debt upon an Obligation to perform certain Covenants, in a pair of
Indentures; The Plaintiff assigned the breach in one of the Covenants; scil.
That the Defendant should do all reparations of such a House demised to him;
And that he had not repaired, but suffered the same to decay. To which the
Defendant said, That the Plaintiff had acquitted and discharged him of the
Reparations. Upon which the Plaintiff demurred in Law. Manwood, The same is an
Acquittal and Discharge of the Reparations as well for the time past, as for
the time to come, by force of the said Covenant, and amounts to as much as if
he had Released the Covenant. And it was moved, If the Covenant being broken
for want of Reparations, If now that Acquital and Discharge, or Release of the
Covenant, should take away the Action upon the Obligation which was once
forfeited before? And it was the Opinion of Manwood, That it should not; For if
one be bound in an Obligation for the performance of Covenants, and before the
breach of any of them, the Obligee releaseth the Covenants, and afterward one
of the Covenants is broken, the Obligation is not forfeited, for there is not
now any Covenant which may be broken, and therefore the Obligation is
discharged: But if the Release had been after the Covenant broken, otherwise:
all which, Dyer and Mounson Concesserunt.

CVI. Mich. 20. Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
Husband and Wife, seized in the right of his Wife of certain Customary Lands
in Fee, he and his Wife by License of the Lord, make a Lease for years by
Indenture rendering Rent, have Issue two Daughters: The Husband dies; The Wife
takes another Husband, and they have issue a Son and a Daughter: The Husband
and Wife die, The Son is admitted to the Reversion, and dies without Issue. It
was holden by Manwood, That this Reversion shall descend to all the Daughters,
notwithstanding the half-blood; For the Estate for years which is made by
Indenture by License of the Lord, is a Demise and Lease according to the Order
of the Common Law; and according to the nature of the Devise, the possession
shall be adjudged; which possession cannot be said, possession of the
Copyholder; For his possession is Customary, and the other is mere contrary,
therefore the possession of the one shall not be said the possession of the
other; and therefore there is no possessio fratris in this Case: But if he had
been Guardian by the Custom, or this Lease had been made by surrender, There
the Sister of the half-blood should not inherit. And Meade said, That the Case
of the Guardian had been so adjudged. Mounson to the same intent; And if the
Copyhold descend to the Son, he is not Copyholder before admittance; 1 Len.
174, 175.
but he may take the profits, and punish Trepass, etc.

CVII. Hind and Lions Case. Hill. 20 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
2 Len. 11. Dyer. 124. Ante 64.
DEbt by Hind, against one as Son and Heir of Sir John Lion, who pleaded,
Nothing by descent, but the third part of the Manor of D. The Plaintiff
replied, Assets; And showed for Assets, That the Defendant had the entire
Manor of B. by descent; Upon which they were at Issue; And it was given in
Evidence to the Jury, That the Manor was holden by Knights-Service, and that
the said Sir John the Ancestor of the Defendant by his Will in writing devised
the whole Manor to his Wife, until the Defendant his Son and Heir should come
to the age of 24 years; And that at the age of the Son of 24 years, his Wife
should hold the third part of the said Manor for the Term of her life, and his
Son should have the residue: And if his Son do die before he come to the age of
24 years without Heir of his body, that the Land should remain over to J.S. the
Remainder over to another. The Devisor died, the Son came to the age of 24
years: Dyer and Mounson, Justices, conceived, That here was not any Estate
tail, and then for two parts he is not in by descent; For no Estate tail shall
rise unless that the Son dies before his said age, and therefore the Tail
never took effect, and the Feesimple descends and remains in the Son, if not
that he dies before the age of 24 years, and then the whole vests with the
Remainder over; but now having attained the said age, he has a Fee, and that
by descent of the whole Manor; and then his Plea is false, that but the third
part descended. And a general Judgment shall be given against him as of his own
debt; And an Elegit shall issue forth of the moiety of all his Lands, as well
those which he has by descent from the same Ancestor, as of his other Lands;
And a Capias lies also against him. But Manwood, Justice, conceived, That if a
general Judgment be given against the Heir by default, in such case a Capias
does not lie, although in case of a false Plea it lies: But Dyer held the
contrary. And the Writ against the Heir is in the debet and detinet; which
proves, That in Law it is his own Debt. And he said, That he could show a
President where such an Action was maintainable against the Executor of the
Heir.

CVIII. Hill. 20 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
A Seized of Lands in Fee, Devised them to his Wife for life; and after her
decease, she to give the same to whom she will; Latch 9,39.
had issue two Daughters, and died; The Wife granted the Reversion to a
stranger, and committed Waste; And the two Daughters brought an Action of
Waste: It was holden by the Justices, That by that Devise, the Wife had but an
Estate for life, but she had gained authority to give the reversion by his Will
to whom she pleased. And such a Grantee should be in by A. and his Will: For A.
had given expressly to his Wife for life, and therefore by Implication she
should not have any further Estate: But if an express Estate had not been
appointed to the Wife; by the other words, an Estate in Feesimple had passed.

CIX. Hill. 20 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
THe Lessor Covenanted with his Lessee, That the Lessee should enjoy the Lands
demised without any lawful Eviction: And afterward upon a Suit depending in
Chancery by a stranger against the Lessor for the Land demised; The Chancellor
made a Decree against the Lessor, and that the stranger should have the Land.
It was moved, If that Decree were a lawful Eviction by which the Covenant was
broken? It was holden by the Lord Dyer, That the same was not any Eviction; For
although that in Conscience it be aequum, that the said stranger have the
possession; yet the same is not by reason of any right paramount the title of
the Lessor; which was in the party for whom it was decreed.

CX. The Marquess of Northamptons Case. Hill. 20 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
PArre, Marquess of Northampton, took to Wife the Lady Bouchier, the Heir of
the Earl of Essex, 1 Roll. 430.
who levied a Fine of the Land of the said Lady, Sur Conusans de droit, etc.
with a Grant and render to them for life, the Remainder to the right Heirs of
the body of the Lady: And afterward by Act of Parliament, 35 H. 8. it was
Enacted, That the said Lady should hold part of her Inheritance, and dispose of
the same as a Feme sole, and that the Marquess should have the Residue, and
that he might Lease the same by himself without his Wife for 21 years or less,
rendering the ancient Rent, being Land which had been usually demised, etc. The
Marquess Leased for 21 years, and afterward durante Termino praedict. Leased
the same Land to another for 21 years, to begin after the determination of the
first Lease. It was moved in this Case, That this last Lease was void, and that
for 3 Causes; 1. Because the Marquess had but an Estate for life, and then it
could not be intended that the Statute did enable one who had but such an
Estate determinable, to make such a Lease, which peradventure might not
commence in his lifetime. 2. The Letter of the Statute is, 21 years, or under;
and the word (Under) strongly expounded the meaning of the Statute to be, not
to extend to such an Estate; For here upon the matter is a Lease for 40 years.
3. Because the Land demised, is the Inheritance of the Wife: And in this Case
it was said, That in the Case of one Heydon, such a private Act was strictly
construed; which was, That it was Enacted, That all Copies for 3 Lives, granted
by the Lord Admiral of the Lands of his Wife, should be good. The Admiral
granted Leases in Reversion for 3 Lives: And it was holden, That that Grant was
not warranted by the Statute. Dyer said, The words are general, Omnes
dimissiones, and therefore not to be restrained unto special Leases; scil. to
Leases in possession. Manwood said, A Feme Covert by duresse, joins in a Lease
with her Husband, the same shall bind her.

CXI. The Queen and Sir John Constables Case. Hill. 20 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
5 Co. Constables Case.
A Quo Warranto was brought by the Queen against Sir John Constable, who
claimed certain Wreck in the County of York; The Defendant pleaded, That Edward
Duke of Buck. was seized of such a Manor, to which he had Wreck appendant, and
that he was de alta proditione debito modo attinctus, and that found before the
Escheator; And showed further, That the said Manor descended to Queen Mary,
who granted the same to the Earl of Westmerland, who granted the same to the
Defendant: Upon which, It was demurred. And Exception was taken to the Plea,
because the Attainder is not fully and certainly pleaded. It was argued by
Plowden, That the Attainder was certainly pleaded, scil. debito modo attinctus;
And it is showed, That the Wreck is appendant to the Manor, and then if the
Defendant has the Manor, he has the Wreck also; and if he has the Manor,
it is not material as to the Queen how he has it, for the Queen does not claim
the same, but impeacheth the Defendant for using there such a Liberty; But if
the Heir of the said Duke had demanded the Manor there against him, the
Attainder ought to have been pleaded certainly. And it was said by him, That
the Interest of the Queen in the Sea, extends unto the midst of the Sea betwixt
England and Spain; But the Queen has the whole Jurisdiction of the Sea between
England and France, because she is Queen of England, France, etc. And so it is
of Ireland.

CXII. Hill. 20 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
TEnant for life made a Feoffment of White-Acre, of which he was seized for
life, and made a Letter of Attorney to deliver Livery and Seisin secundum formam
Chartae; before Livery, the Tenant purchased the Fee; and afterward Livery was
made: It was resolved by the Court in this Case, That all passed: But if the
Feoffment had been of all his Lands in D. and the Letter of Attorney
accordingly; and before Livery made, the Feoffee had many Lands there; If he
purchased one Acre after, the Livery should not extend to that Acre, because
the Authority was satisfied by the other Acre.

CXIII. Banks and Thwaits Case. Mich. 21 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
IN an Action upon the Case, the Case was, That A. had pawned an Indenture of
Lease for years, of a Message and Lands to Banks; Thwaits, intending to
purchase the same, required Banks to deliver him the said Lease, and he would
give Banks 10 l. whether he bought it or no, at what time he would request the
10 l. Post. 200.
And Banks delivered the same to Thwaits accordingly. Post. 200.
And afterward brought an Action upon the Case, and declared upon the whole
matter; and concluded, Licet saepius requisitus, etc. without alleging a
request express in certain, and the day and place of it. It was said by Cook,
That here the moneys did not grow due before Request, nor is payable before
Request, and therefore a Request ought to be made in facto; And so, he said, It
was ruled in this Court, in an Action upon the Case, betwixt Palmer and
Buroughs; and he said, that the Money was not due by the Promise, but by the
Request. And it was the Opinion of the whole Court, That although it be a duty,
Yet it is not a duty payable before Request; And the Request makes a Title to
the Action: But if A. sells to B. a Horse for 10 l. there is a Contract, and
a Request in facto, need not be laid. And the Opinion of the Court was also,
That upon this matter the Plaintiff could not have an Action of Debt; for there
is not any Contract, for the thing is not sold, but it is a Collateral promise
grounded upon the delivery: And by Clench, Here the Request is traversable: And
afterward Judgment was given against the Plaintiff. And it was said, It was so
ruled in Alderman Pullisons Case, in the Exchequer. Post. 201.


CXIV. Segar and Boyntons Case. Mich. 21 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
2 Len. 156.
IN Trespass, the Case was this; King Henry the 8th, Anno 27 of his Reign, gave
the Manor of D. to Sir Edward Boynton, Knight, and to the Heirs Males of his
body; Sir Edward Boynton had Issue Andrew his eldest Son, and C. the Defendant
his younger Son, and died: Andrew Boynton Covenanted by Indenture with the Lord
Seymore, that the said Andrew Boynton would assure the said Manor to the use
of himself for life, the Remainder to the said Lord and his Heirs: The said
Lord Seymore in recompense thereof, should assure other Lands to the use of
himself for life, the remainder to the use of the said Andrew Boynton in tail;
who 37 H. 8. levied a Fine of the said Manor without proclamations to two
strangers, to the uses according to the said Agreement; and before any
Assurance made by the said Lord, The said Lord was Attainted of Treason, and
all his Lands were forfeited to the King: And afterward the said Andrew
Boynton made a Suggestion to Queen Mary, of the whole matter; and upon his
humble Petition, the said Queen by her Letters Patents reciting the said
Mischief, etc. et praemissa considerans, et annuens Petitioni illius, granted
to him the Manor aforesaid; and further de ampliori gratia sua, Released to
the said Andrew Boynton all her Right, Possession, etc. which came to her
ratione attincturae praedict', vel in manibus nostris existant, vel existere
deberent: After which, viz. 5 Eliz. Andrew Boynton levied a Fine to the
Plaintiff with proclamations, and died without Issue. And, the Defendant as
Issue in tail entered. Puckering, Sergeant; It is to see, 1. If by the words of
the Letters Patents of Queen Mary, viz. de ampliori sua gratia, etc. the
Reversion in Fee which the Queen had, passed or not. 2. Admitting that the
Reversion did not pass, Then if the Fine levied by Andrew Boynton, 5 Eliz. to
the Plaintiff, the Reversion being in the Queen, be a Bar to the Issue; For
when the first Fine was levied 37 H. 8. which was levied without proclamations,
the same shall not bind the Issue in tail, neither as to the Right, nor to the
Entry, for it is not any Discontinuance, because the Reversion is in the King,
as of things which lie in Discontinuance, Rent, Common, etc. For such Fine is a
Fine at the Common Law, and not within the Statute of 4 H. 7. And such a Fine
is void against the Issue: But if such a Fine without proclamations be levied
of a thing which lies in Discontinuance, then such a Fine is not void, but
voidable by a Formedon: And therefore this Fine, in the Case at Bar, being
levied without proclamations of Lands entailed, whereof the Reversion is in the
King at the time of the Fine levied, shall not bind the Issue; And by such Fine
the Conusee has which Fee was forfeited to the Queen by the Attainder of the
Lord Seymore, and that the Queen immediately restored to Andrew Boynton,
because the Lord Seymore had not according to Agreement betwixt them, assured
his Lands to the said Andrew Boynton in Recompense; For the Indentures
themselves were not sufficient to raise any use. See acc. 1 Mar. Dyer, 96. As
to the point he conceived, That nothing passed of the Reversion, For the Grant
has reference to the words, All his Right, Possession, etc. which came to her
ratione attincturae, and all the residue of the Grant, ought to have reference
to that, to the ratione attincturae praedict. which was the foundation of the
whole grant; And here the intent of the Queen was not to other intent, but only
to restore Andrew Boynton to the said Manor, and to his ancient Estate in it;
And nothing appears in the said Letters Patents by which it might appear, that
the Queen was apprised of her Reversion which she had by descent, and therefore
the same cannnot pass by general words: If the King grants the Goods and
Chattels of all those who have done any Trespass for which vitam amittere
debent, The Goods of him who is Attainted of Treason, shall not be forfeited or
granted by such general words: 8 H. 4. 2. Vid. Roll. Tit. Prerogat.
The King grants omnia catalla Tenentium suorum qualitercunque damnatorum, the
same does not extend to the Goods of him who is condemned for Treason. See 22
Ass. 49. So in our Case, the Patent shall not serve to two Intents, and not to
pass two Interests by these general words; and then nothing passes but the Fee
determinable which was conveyed to the Lord Seymore, and forfeited by the
Attainder. Then it is to be considered, How after the said Grant, the said
Andrew Seymore is seized; And he conceived, That he should be in of the said
Fee determinable, and not of an Estate in tail, against his own Fine; and then
if he be not seized by force of the Tail at the time of the Fine levied, 5
Eliz. the same Fine cannot bind the entail: But admitting, That at the time of
the second Fine levied, that he was in of an Estate in tail, yet that Fine
shall not bar the Issue; For first, This Fine cannot make any Discontinuance,
because that the Reversion in Fee is in the King, which is not touched by the
Fine. See the Case of Saunders, Where A. makes a Lease for years, to begin at a
day to come, and afterward levies a Fine to a stranger with proclamations, and
the 5 years pass, and afterward at the day of the beginning of the said Lease,
the Lessee enters; his Entry is lawful, and he shall not be bounden by the
Nonclaim; and so it was adjudged in Saunders and Starkies Case. Vide inde
Saffins Case, 3 Jac. Cook 5 Part, 123, 124. After the making of the Statute of
4 H. 7. of Fines, It was much doubted, If the Issues of Common Tenants in tail
should be bound by a Fine with proclamations, because upon the death of their
Ancestors, they are as new Purchasors per formam Doni. And therefore it was
provided by 32 H. 8. That the said Statute of 4 H. 7. should extend to such
Common entails; but there was no doubt of an Estate tail of the gift of the
King. And see Mich. 15 and 16 Eliz. Rot. 1474. between Jackson and Darcy, in a
Partitione facienda, the Case was, Tenant in tail, the remainder to the King,
after the Statute of 32 H. 8. levied a Fine with proclamations, and it was
adjudged, That the same should bind the Issues; The Act of 32 H. 8. does not
extend but where the Reversion is in the King, but no mention is there of a
Remainder, because that the words of the said Act are general of all Tenants in
tail; The makers of the Act perceiving, That it might be doubted, that the
generality of the words might include all Estates tails of the gift of the
King, they restrained the words in a special manner; as appears by the last
Proviso of the same Act, Nor to any Fines heretofore levied or hereafter to be
levied by any person or persons of any Manors, etc. before the levying of the
said Fine, given, granted or assigned to the person or persons levying the said
Fine, or to any of his or their Ancestors in tail by Letters Patents, or Act of
Parliament, the Reversion whereof at the time of the levying of such Fine was
in the King: And so such Estates are excepted, And that in such Cases, where
such Fines are levied, they shall be of such force as they should be if the
said Act had not been made. And therefore it seemed to the said Parliament,
That such Estate tails of the gift of the King were not bounden by the Statute
of 4 H. 7. for otherwise, the said Proviso or Exception had been frivolous.
Walmesley, Sergeant, to the contrary; And he agreed, That the first Fine was
not any Discontinuance; and yet he conceived it is not altogether void against
the Issues before that they entered; For no right remains in the Conusor against
his Fine: And also he conceived, That this Clause, ex uberiori gratia, did
extend to pass more than passed before; For he conceived, That the Queen
intended more liberally, viz. the Reversion; For this is not any matter of
Prerogative, but the same is a matter of Interest, which might also in the
Kings Case pass out of the King by general words. See 3 H. 7. 6 and 7 Br.
Patents, 48. A Grant of the King ex insinuatione, does not hinder the force of
the words, ex mero motu. And it was the Opinion of the whole Court, That the
Reversion which was in the King did not pass by that Grant; For the whole scope
of the Patent was, as he conceived, to grant only that which the King had then
ratione attincturae. Anderson conceived the Patent insufficient, because the
Petition was not full and certain; Also he said, That ex speciali gratia, etc.
would not help this Case; For the Estate tail is not recited, but only that he
was seized de Statu haereditario, etc. so the Queen was deceived, etc. Periam
contrary, The Queen was advised of the Mischief, and granted such Estate with
which he parted by the Fine. And as to the other Point, Walmesley conceived,
That the Fine with proclamations should bind the tail: And as to the Objection
which has been made, That the Conusor at the time of the Fine levied, was not
seized by force of the entail; The same had been a good matter to have alleged
to avoid a Common Recovery in the Tenant to the Praecipe, but not to this
purpose: For if there be Tenant in tail, and he levieth a Fine, although he was
not seized at the time of the Fine levied by force of the entail, yet such a
Fine shall bind the issue; So if Tenant in tail discontinueth, and disseiseth
the Discontinuee, and so levies a Fine. And he conceived, That the issue in
tail is bound by the Statute of 4 H. 7. even of the Gift of the King. See 19 H.
8. 6 and 7. Where it is holden, That the Issue in tail is bound by the Statute
of 4 H. 7. And where it has been Objected, That it does not extend but to such
Fines which make Discontinuance at the Common Law, The same is not so: For if
Tenant in tail of a Rent, or Common, levieth a Fine with proclamations, it is
clear, that the issues shall be barred by it. And he much relied upon 29 H. 8.
Dyer, 32. Tenant in tail of the Gift of the King levieth a Fine, or suffers a
Common Recovery, although it be not a Discontinuance, because that the
Reversion is in the King; yet it is a bar unto the Issue. But Note, That that
was before the Statute of 34 H. 8. See Wisemans Case, 27 Eliz. Cook 2 Part. And
see the Lord Staffords Case, 7 Jac. Cook 8 Part, 78.

A Man seized of Lands called Hayes, 3 Cro. 674. 2 Cro. 21, 22
which extended into two Towns, A and B. Devised Hayes-Land in A. to his Wife
for life, and after to his Son; and if the Son die without issue, then
Hayes-Land shall remain to his 3 Daughters, etc. The Son died without issue: It
was the Opinion of Anderson and Periam, Justices, That all Hayes-Land should
not pass by the said Devise, but only that which was in A.

CXVI. Henry and Brode's Case. Mich. 21 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
IN an Action of Trespass, the Plaintiff declared, That the Defendant simul cum
J. S. and another Clausum suum fregit; 1 Len. 41.
And Exception was taken to it, because here it appears upon the Plaintiffs
own showing, That the Trespass whereof, etc. was made by the Defendant and
another; and therefore the Writ brought against Broad only, was not good. But
if it had been simul cum aliis ignotis personis, It had been good enough. But
here the Plaintiff has confessed another person trespassor with the Defendant.
See 2 H. 7. 15. 8 H. 5 5. 14 H. 4. 22. Yet afterward in the principal Case,
Judgment was given for the Plaintiff.

THe Case was; A Woman Tenant in tail within the Statute of 11 H. 7. accepted a
Fine Sur Conusans de droit come ceo, etc. and by the same Fine rendered the Land
to the Conusor for 1000 years: It was moved, If this Conveyance and Disposition
was within the penalty of the Statute: For the Statute speaks of
Discontinuances, etc. And it was the clear Opinion of the Court, That the same
is within the Statute, for by such practice, the meaning of the Statute might
be defeated: And if such Render for a 100 years should be good, by the same
reason for 1000 years, which is as great a mischief and as dangerous to those
in Reversion, as Discontinuances. And by Rhodes, Justice, It has been
adjudged, That if a Woman who has title of Dower, if before she be endowed,
she will enter and levy a Fine, the same is within the said Statute, and yet
she is not Tenant in Dower. See 5 Mar. Dyer 148. Penicocks Case. And 36 Eliz.

CXVIII. Mich. 21 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
2 Len. 221. Ante 9.
A By his last Will, willed, That his Lands should descend to his Son; but
willed, That his Wife should take the profits thereof until the full age of
his said Son of 21 years to maintain, and bring him up, and died; The Wife took
Husband, and died, during the nonage of the Son: It was the opinion of Wray and
Southcote, Justice, That the second Husband should not have the profits until,
etc. For nothing is devised to the Wife but a Confidence; and she is as a
Guardian or Bailiff, to aid the Enfant, which by her death is determined, and
cannot accrue to the Husband; But if the Husband had devised the profits of the
Land to the Wife, until the age of the Enfant, for to bring up and educate, Ut
supra. Wray said, The same amounted to a devise of the Land and so a Chattel in
the Wife, which should accrue to the Husband.

CXIX. Stamps Case. Mich. 24 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
THe Case was: John Stamp being possessed of a Term for years granted the same
to Thomas Stamp his Brother 12 May 20 Eliz. And afterward, 8 October. 21 Eliz.
he himself being in possession of it, Mortgaged the same to one P. who suffered
him to continue his possession: Thomas Stamp granted his Estate to John
Stamp, who mortgaged the same to one G. who suffered the said John Stamp to
continue in possession until 10 December, 22 Eliz. G. entered, John Stamp came
to the said P. and requested him, that he would grant all his Estate to B. and
C. to whom the said John Stamp was endebted for security of their Moneys; To
whom the said P. said, That if he would find him any other surety for his Debt,
he is contented so to do. And John Stamp offered to the said P. the said B.
and C. and he accepted the same, and at the request of the said John Stamp,
granted his Interest to them 2 Feb. 22 Eliz. P. having notice of the Grant
before made to the said G. Upon which G. informed against P. upon the Statute
of 32 H. 8. It was holden in this Case by Periam and Meade, Justice, That P.
was not within the penalty of the Statute: For P. granted his Interest to B.
and C. at the suit and at the request of John Stamp, who was the Mortgager,
for assurance of his Debt which he ought to them; And therefore it shall not be
intended, that that Grant was made for any maintenance, or for any unlawful
cause against the Statute. And also John Stamp who granted unto P. had
possession, and received the Issues and Profits of the said Lands for a whole
year before the Grant, notwithstanding that he was not in possession by a whole
year next before the day of the date of the Grant. Godb. 450.
As if a Man be in possession, or has received the Issues and Profits for a
whole year, and afterward a stranger enters upon him, and has the possession
for the space of a Quarter of a year, or half a year; yet he who was in
possession by a year before, may grant his Interest without danger of the
Statute, etc.

CXX. Pasch. 24 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
NOte: Per totam Curiam; 2 Len. 35.
A man made his Will in this manner; scil. I Will and Bequeath my Land to A.
And the name of the Devisor is not in the whole Will; Yet the Devise is good
enough by Averment of the name of the Devisor. And for proof that the same is
his Will, If one lying in extremis, having an intent to devise his Lands by
Word, makes such devise, but does not command the same to be put in writing,
but another without the knowledge or Commandment of the Devisor, puts it in
writing in the lifetime of the Devisor, the same is a good Devise; For it is
sufficient, if the Devise be reduced into writing during the life of the
Devisor.

CXXI. Pepy's Case. Pasch. 25 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
WAste was brought by F. and his Wife against Pepy; and declared, That the said
Pepy was seized, and enfeoffed certain persons to the use of himself for life,
and afterward to the use of the Wife of the Plaintiff, and her Heirs: The
Defendant pleaded, That the said Feoffment was to the use of himself and his
Heirs in Fee, etc. absque hoc, that it was to the uses, as in the Count; Upon
which they were at Issue: And it was found by Verdict, That the said Feoffment
was to the uses contained in the Count; but further found, That the Estate of
the Defendant by the Limitation of the use was privileged with the impunity of
Waste; scil. without Impeachment of Waste. It was moved, If upon that Verdict,
The Plaintiff should have Judgment. Anderson and Rhodes, Justices, conceived,
That he should, for that the matter in Issue is found for the Plaintiff; and
that is, the Feoffment to uses contained in the Count, and this impunity of
Waste is a Foreign matter not within the Charge of the Jury; and therefore the
finding of the same is but matter of surplusage: As if I plead a Feoffment of
J. S. to which the other pleads, That he did not enfeoff, and the Jury find a
Conditional Feoffment, the Court shall not respect the finding of the
Condition, for it was not in Issue, and no advantage shall be ever had of such
a Liberty if it be not pleaded, 30 H. 8. Dyer 41. In Dower, the Tenant pleaded,
Ne unque seisi que Dower, etc. The Tenant pleaded, That before the Coverture of
the Demandant, one A. was seized, and gave the Land whereof Dower is demanded
to the Husband of the Demandant in tail, who made a Feoffment; A stranger took
the Demandant to Wife, took back an Estate in Fee, and died seized, having
Issue inheritable: Now although upon the truth of the matter she is not Dowable
de jure, yet forasmuch as the parties were at Issue upon a point certain, no
foreign, nor strange matter not in Question betwixt the parties shall be
respected in the point of Judgment: But if the Defendant had pleaded it in Bar,
he might have foreclosed the Demandant of her Dower. See 38 Ass. 27. 47 E. 19.
In a Praecipe quod reddat upon the default of the Tenant, came one and showed,
How that the Tenant who made default, was but Tenant for life of the Lands in
demand, the Reversion in Fee to himself, and prayed to be received: The
Demandant counterpleaded the Resceit, Dicendo, That the Tenant had Fee, etc.
Upon which, Issue was taken: And it was found, That neither the Tenant, nor he
who prayed to be received, had any thing in the Land. And in that Case, The
Court did not regard the matter which was superfluous in the Verdict; For they
were at Issue upon a point certain; scil. whether the Tenant was seized in Fee:
For it is confessed of the one side, and of the other, that he had an Estate
for life, and of that matter the Jury was not charged, and they are not to
enquire of that; And so it is found against the Demandant, by which the Resceit
was granted. See 7 H. 6. 20. The parties were at Issue upon a Dying seized;
which is found by Verdict; but the Jury find further, That the other party made
continual Claim: The said continual Claim shall not be respected in point of
Judgment, because it was not pleaded in Avoidance of the Disceit, etc. Windham,
Justice, to the contrary, because it appears to us upon the Verdict, That the
Plaintiff has not cause of Action, and therefore he shall not have Judgment:
As in Detinue, the Plaintiff declares upon a Baylment by his own hands; The
Defendant pleads, Ne Detinue pas, the Jury find the Detinue but upon Baylment
by another hand: In that case notwithstanding that the Detinue be found; yet
the Plaintiff shall not have Judgment. But Anderson, Rhodes, and Periam
conceived, That in the principal Case Judgment should be given for the
Plaintiff: For in no case the party shall have advantage of that liberty of
impunity of Waste, if he does not plead it; And the Jurors are not to meddle
with any matter which is not in issue; and if they do, It is but matter of
surplusage, and to no purpose; and afterward, Judgment was given for the
Plaintiff. See the Number Roll, Pasch. 25 Eliz. Rot. 602.

CXXII. Skipwith's Case. Pasch. 20 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
IN an Action of Trespass: It was found by a special Verdict; Godbolt 14, 143.
Co. of Copy-holds 94.
That the Lands were Copyhold Lands. That the Custom of the Manor was, That
Quaelibet Foemina Viro Co-operta poterit devise Lands, of which she was seized
of an Estate of Inheritance in Fee simple according to the Custom to her
Husband; And also Surrender the same in the presence of the Steward and 6 other
of the Tenants. And it was further found, That one J.S. was seized of the
Copyhold Lands, wherein the Trespass was; And that he had Issue 2 Daughters
and died seized of the said Lands: And that after his Decease his two Daughters
entered into the said Lands, and afterward, they both took Husbands; And that
afterward, one of the said Daughters made a Will in writing, and by her said
Will, in the presence of the Steward, and six of the Tenants, she Devised her
part of the said Copyhold Lands to her Husband and his Heirs; and at the next
Court, surrendered the said Copyhold Lands in the presence of the Steward and
six other of the Tenants, to the uses in her Will expressed, and shortly after
she died; and that after her death, her Husband was admitted to the said part
of her Lands: who continued the possession thereof; And the Husband of the
other Daughter and his Wife entered upon him: Upon whom, he re-entred; And the
Husband brought Trespass. This Case was argued at the Bar, by Rhodes: And he
said, That the Custom was not good; neither for the Devise, nor for the
Surrender. First, for the incertainty of the Estate, what Estate she might
Devise, for that is not expressed in the Custom; but generally that she might
Devise her Copyhold Lands of Inheritance, without expressing for what Estate.
And secondly, the Custom is not good; for that it is against reason, that the
Wife should surrender to the use of her Husband; And that a Custom to devise is
not good where it is uncertain, he vouched many Cases; As 13 E. 3. tit. Dum
fuit infra aetatem. 3. The Tenant said, That the Lands lay in the County of
Dorset, where the Custom is, That an Enfant might make a Grant or a Feoffment
when he could number 12 d. and because it is uncertain when he could do it, It
was holden to be a void Custom. So 19 E. 2. tit. Guard. 127. In a Ravishment of
Ward, It was alleged, that the Custom was, That when an Enfant could measure
an Ell of Cloth, or number 12 d. that he should be out of Ward; And it was
holden to be a void Custom for the incertainty: Also he said, That in the
principal Case, the Custom was void; for that it was against reason, that the
Wife should surrender to her Husband; for every Surrender is a Gift: and a
Woman cannot give unto her Husband; for the Wife has not any disposing Will,
but the Will of her Husband only. And therefore the Case is in 21 E. 3. That if
the Husband be seized of Lands in the right of his Wife; and he makes a
Feoffment in Fee of the Lands, and the Wife being upon the Lands does disagree,
and says, She will not depart with the Land during her life; yet the Feoffment
is a good Feoffment, and shall bind the Wife during the life of the Husband.
And see 3 E. 3. Br. tit. Devise, 43. That a Feme Covert cannot Devise to her
Husband, for that should be the Act of the Husband to convey the Lands to
himself. And whereas the Case in 29 E. 3. was Objected against him, where the
Case was, That a Woman being seized of Land deviseable, took a Husband, and had
Issue by him; and the Wife Devised her Lands to her Husband for his life, and
died; and a Writ of Waste was afterward brought against him: And it was there
holden, That the Writ did lie. He said, That that Case did make rather for him
than against him, for that Case proves, that the Husband did not take the Land
by virtue of the Devise in his own right; but that he held the Lands having
Issue by the Wife as Tenant by the Courtesy, and so under another Title; and
therefore it appears, that the Writ of Waste was there brought against him as
Tenant by the Courtesy. Also he said, That the Devise was void by the Statute
of 34 H. 8. Cap. 5. where it is Enacted, That Wills and Testaments made of any
Lands, Tenements, etc. by Women Coverts shall not be good or effectual in the
Law; and he said, That that Statute did extend to Copyhold Lands: But as to
that, all the Justices did agree, That Copyhold Lands were not within the words
of that Statute. But Anderson said, That the Equity of that Act did extend to
Copyholds: And further Anderson said, That the Prescription, or Custom in the
principal Case was not good; for it is laid to be, That Quaelibet Foemina Viro
Co-operta poterit, and it ought to be potest; and by the Custom have used to
Devise to the Husband: And a Prescription must be in a thing done, and not in
posse. Also he said, That the Custom if it were good, is not well pursued; For
the Custom is, that she may Devise and Surrender in the presence of the Steward
and six Tenants, and that must be intended to be done all at one time; for the
words of a Custom are to be performed, if it may be: but in the principal case,
the Devise is laid to be at one time, and the Surrender at another time, and so
it is not in pursuance of the Custom: But to that it was not answered. But then
it was said, Admit that the Custom to devise, and the Devise were not good; yet
the Action did not lie against the Defendant, because that the Husband was
admitted, and his Entry into the Land was countenanced by a lawful Ceremony;
and also he was Tenant in Common with the other Husband by such Entry. It was
adjourned.

CXXIII. Rosse's Case. Mich. 26 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
IN Trespass brought by Rosse, for breaking of his Close, and beating of his
Servant, and carrying away of his Goods: Post. 94.
Upon Not guilty pleaded, the Jury found this special matter; scil. That Sir
Thomas Bromley, Chancellor of England, was seized of the Land where, etc. and
leased the same to the Plaintiff and one A. which A. assigned his moiety to
Cavendish; by whose Commandment the Defendant entered. It was moved, That that
Tenancy in Common betwixt the Plaintiff, and him in whose right the Defendant
justified, could not be given in Evidence; and so it could not be found by
Verdict, but it ought to have been pleaded at the beginning. But the whole
Court were clear of another Opinion; and that the same might be given in
Evidence well enough. It was further moved against the Verdict, That the same
did not extend to all the points in the Declaration, but only to the breaking
of the Close, without enquiry of the battery, etc. And for that cause, it was
clearly holden by the Court, That the Verdict was void; And a Venire facias de
novo was awarded.

CXXIV. Absolon and Andertons Case. Mich. 25 and 26 Eliz. Rot. 479. In the
Kings Bench.
WIlliam Absolon Master of the Savoy, and the Chaplains there, brought Debt
against Anderton; The Case was, That the said Master and Chaplains leased Lands
to the Defendant for certain years; and afterward he accepted of them an
Indenture of Bargain and Sale to him and his Heirs, by express words of Bargain
and Sale, without other words; And one of the Masters of the Chancery within
the 6 months came unto them into their Chapter House, and before him they
acknowledged the said Indenture to be their Deed, and prayed that it be
enrolled; which was done accordingly. It was moved, If that acknowledgment and
Enrollment were good or not; or if the Master and the Chaplains ought to have
appointed one by their Warrant, to be their Attorney, to acknowledge the said
Deed? And it was also moved, 1 Len. 184.
If there needed any Enrollment at all of it, because Anderton had then an
Interest in the Land for years; in which case it is to be considered, If the
words Barganizavi and Vendidi, shall be of such effect, as the words Dedi and
Concessi? And it was said by the Court, That a Warrant of Attorney to
acknowledge a Deed were a strange thing. And it was agreed, That the Indenture
being once Enrolled, it was not material by what means it was Enrolled; but was
good being done.

CXXV. Savell and Badcocks Case. Mich. 26 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
SAvell brought an Action of Trespass against Badcock, and declared, That Edw.
Savell was seized of the Manor of D. and leased the same for years to Henry
Savell, who died, having made the Plaintiff his Executor, who entered, and was
possessed until the first day of January, at which time the Trespass was done.
The Defendant pleaded, Not guilty. And it was given in Evidence on the
Plaintiffs part, That the said Ed. Savell was seized, and leased to the said
Henry Savell for years, who so possessed, reciting the said Lease, Demised the
said Manor to Sir William Cordell, Master of the Rolls, to have to him
immediately after the decease of the said Henry for so many years of the said
Term which at the time of his death should be unexpired, if Dorothy the Wife of
the said Henry should so long live: Henry died, Sir William Cordell entered;
Dorothy died within the Term; the Plaintiff the Executor of Henry entered, and
was possessed until the first day of Januarii, 23 Eliz. at which day the
Trespass was done. On the Defendants part it was given in Evidence, That after
the Grant to Sir William Cordell, the said Henry and Edward joined in a fine
Sur Conusans de droit, etc. to a stranger, who granted and rendered the Land to
the said Henry and his Heirs, who devised the same to the said Dorothy his Wife
for life, the remainder to Cordell Savell in tail, the remainder over, and
died; Dorothy entered, and died; Cordell Savell, 22 Eliz. conveyed the Manor by
Fine to one Williamson, who entered; and afterward and before the Trespass
aforesaid, viz. 14 January, 23 Eliz. leased to the Defendant for years, by
force of which the Defendant entered. And upon this Evidence, there was a
Demurrer in Law. And it was argued by Shuttleworth, who was made Sergeant the
last Term. And he said, That the Demise made by Henry Savell is not in the
inconveniency of the maxim, that Henry by the said Grant should reserve a
lesser Estate to himself, than he had before; For here by this Grant, no
present interest passes by Sir William Cordell, but the effect of the Grant
rests upon a Contingency; scil. if he himself dies within the Term, etc. until
which time the whole interest of the Term does remain in the said Henry Savell
subject to the Contingency aforesaid, and amounts to so much; as if the said
Henry had granted the same to Sir William Cordell, if he himself should die
within the Term: in which Case, it is a limitation when the said Grant shall
take effect. As if I grant unto you my Lease for so many years as J.S. shall
name, the same is a good Grant to take effect upon the naming of J.S. Then the
Case being so, When Henry Savell the Lessee, and Edward Savell the Lessor join
in a Fine, ut supra, now the possibility of the remnant of the Term which upon
the death of Henry Savell and Dorothy his Wife within the Term might accrue to
the Executors of the said Henry Savell, is not extinct by the Fine, but does
remain Quodam modo in Henry Savell, to vest in his Executors, if it should
happen; And here is not any conclusion by the Fine in this Case; for Henry at
the time of the Fine had not in him any Interest, which is now claimed, and so
cannot be bound by the Fine: For the Interest in respect of which the Plaintiff
has cause of Action, begineth after the death of Henry who levied the Fine;
and first accrueth to his Executors, and so shall not be touched by the Fine:
and therefore if such a Lessee for years grants his Term to J.S. Proviso,
That if J.S. dies within the Term, that he himself shall have it again; and
afterward the Grantor joins with his Lessor in a Fine, and afterward within
the Term J.S. dies, now the Grantor notwithstanding the Fine shall have the
residue of the Term; Then, when the Conusee by the Fine regrants the Land to
Henry in Fee, that possibility to have after the death of the Donor cannot be
drowned in the Fee simple for the reason aforesaid; And then when Henry
devises the same to his Wife, that possibility does pass to Dorothy, because
it was never in the Devisor; and then when Dorothy dies within the Term, the
Residue of the said Term shall accrue to the Plaintiff as Executor of Henry.
Cook, contrary, And he held, The Grant to Sir William Cordell is utterly void;
And he agreed, That Grants although in themselves they be uncertain; yet if
they may be reduced to certain, they are good: but here is no expectance of any
certainty in the life of Henry; for the Term limited to Sir William Cordell, is
not to begin till the death of Henry, and is to end upon the death of Dorothy,
so as here is not any certain beginning, nor certain end; and here this Grant
cannot be reduced to any Certainty during the life of the Grantor, and so for
that cause is void, See Plow. Com. 6 Eliz. Say and Fullers Case, 273. by
Weston, Justice, If A. makes a Lease for so many years as J.S. shall name, if
J.S. in the life of A. name a certain number of years, then the Lease is good;
but if the Lease had been for so many years as my Executors shall name, that
can never be made good in my life; And upon that reason it is, That an
Attornment ought to be made in the life of the Grantor, or else no Reversion
shall pass. So 33 E. 3. Entry, 79. A Bishop aliens, and after his death, the
Dean and Chapter confirms, it is a void Confirmation. And 7 E. 6. Br. Grants,
154. A Man possessed of a Lease for 40 years, grants so many of the said years
which shall be to come at the time of his death, it is a void Grant for the
incertainty. Afterward, Shuttleworth moved another point, viz. The Plaintiff
has declared of a Trespass done, 1 Januarii, 23 Eliz. The Defendant shows in
Evidence, a Lease for years to him made 14 Januarii, the same year, which is 13
days after the Trespass whereof the Plaintiff has declared, and it shall not
be intended that the Plaintiff had another Title than that which he has
alleged; and forasmuch as he has not disclosed in himself any Title Tempore
transgressionis the Plaintiff should punish him in respect of his first
possession without any other Title. And although it may be Objected, That where
the Defendant has given in Evidence, That Williamson leased to the Defendant,
that is not sufficient; and the words subsequent 14 Januarii, are void as a
nugation and matter of surplusage; Truly, the Law is contrary; for rather those
words ante Transgressionem shall be void, because too general, and shall give
way to the subsequent words after the videlicet, because they are special and
certain: As the Case late adjudged; The Archbishop of Canterbury leased three
parcels of Land, rendering Rent of 8 l. per annum; viz. for one parcel, 5 l. for
another, 50 s. and for the third, 40, which amounts to 9 l. 10 s. It was
adjudged, That the videlicet, and the words subsequent concerning the special
reservation of the Rent, was utterly void, because contrary to the premises,
which were certain, viz. 8 l. and that the Fermor should pay but 8 l. according
to the general reservation: but in our case, the words precedent are general,
i. e. ante Transgressionem, and therefore the words subsequent, which are
special and certain, shall be taken, and the general words rejected; As in
Trespass, the Defendant pleads, That A. was seized of the Land where, and held
it of the Defendant; and that the said A. 1 die Maii, 6 Eliz. aliened the said
Land in Mortmain, for which he (within a year after) viz. 4 Maii, Anno 7 Eliz.
entered, now the same is no bar; for upon the evidence it appears, that the
Lord has surceased his time, and the words, (within the year) shall not help
him, for they are too general; and therefore, at the subsequent words (viz.
etc.) Cook on the Defendants part took Exception; For it appears here upon
the Evidence of the Defendant, which is confessed by the Demurrer of the
Plaintiff, That upon this matter the Plaintiff cannot punish the Defendant for
this Trespass; for he was not an immediate Trespassor to the Plaintiff; for the
Plaintiff has declared upon a Trespass done 1 Januarii, 23 Eliz. And it is
given in Evidence on the part of the Defendant, and confessed by the Plaintiff,
etc. That 22 Eliz. Cordell Savell levied a Fine to Williamson, by force of
which the said Williamson entered, and was seized; and so seized, 14 Januarii,
23 Eliz. leased to the Defendant: Now upon this matter the Plaintiff cannot
have Trespass, but the Defendant; for Williamson was the immediate Trespassor
to him; for he entered 22 Eliz. And at length, after deliberation had of the
premises by the Court, The Court moved the Plaintiff to discontinue his suit,
and to bring de novo a new Action, in which the matter in Law might come into
Judgment without any other Exception. But the Plaintiff would not agree to it.
Wherefore it was said by Wray, Chief Justice, with the consent of his
Companions, Begin again at your peril; for we are all agreed, That you cannot
have Judgment upon this Action.

CXXVI. Mich. 26 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
THe Case was; A. made a Feoffment in Fee to the use of his younger Son in
tail; and after to the use of the Heirs of his body in posterum procreand. and
at the time of the Feoffment he had Issue two Sons; and after the Feoffment had
Issue a third Son: The younger Son died without Issue, Upon a Motion at the
Bar, it was said by Wray, Justice, That after the death without Issue of the
second Son, the Land should go to the third Son born after the Feoffment, for
this word (in posterum) is a forcible word to create a special Inheritance;
without that, it had been a general tail.

CXXVII. Smith and Smith's Case. Mich. 26 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
LAmber Smith Executor of Tho. Smith, brought an Action upon the Case against
John Smith, That whereas the Testator having diverse Children Enfants, and lying
sick of a mortal sickness, being careful to provide for his said Children
Enfants; The Defendant in Consideration the Testator would commit the Education
of his Children, and the disposition of his Goods after his death during the
minority of his said Children, for the Education of the said Children to him,
promised to the Testator, to procure the assurance of certain Customary Lands
to one of the Children of the said Testator: And declared further, That the
Testator thereupon Constituted the Defendant Overseer of his Will, and Ordained
and appointed by his Will, That his Goods should be in the disposition of the
Defendant, and that the Testator died, and that by reason of that Will, the
Goods of the Testator to such a value came to the Defendants hands to his great
profit and advantage. And upon Non Assumpsit pleaded, It was found for the
Plaintiff: And upon Exception to the Declaration in Arrest of Judgment for want
of sufficient Consideration, It was said die Wray, Chief Justice, That here is
not any benefit to the Defendant, that should be a Consideration in Law, to
induce him to make this promise; For the Consideration is no other, but to have
the disposition of the Goods of the Testator pro educatione Liberorum: For all
the disposition is for the profit of the Children; and notwithstanding, That
such Overseers commonly make gain of such disposition, yet the same is against
the intendment of the Law, which presumes every Man to be true and faithful if
the contrary be not showed; and therefore the Law shall intend, That the
Defendant has not made any private gain to himself, but that he has disposed
of the Goods of the Testator to the use and benefit of his Children according
to the Trust reposed in him. Which Ayliffe, Justice, granted. Gaudy, Justice,
was of the contrary Opinion. And afterward by Award of the Court, It was, That
the Plaintiff Nihil Capiat per Billam.

CXXVIII. Amner and Luddington's Case. Mich. 26 Eliz. Rot. 495. In the Kings
Bench.
A Writ of Error was brought in the Kings Bench by Amner against Luddington,
Mich. 26 Eliz. Rot. 495. 2 Len. 92. 8 Co. 96.
And the Case was, That one Weldon was seized, and leased to one Peerepoint for
99 years, who devised the same by his Will in this manner: viz. I Bequeath to
my Wife the Lease of my House during her life; and after her death, I will it
go amongst my Children unpreferred. Peerepoint died, his Wife entered, and was
possessed virtute legationis praedictae, And took to Husband one Fulsehurst,
against whom Beswick recovered in an Action of Debt 140 l. Upon which Recovery,
issued a Scire facias; and upon that a Vendit' Exponas; upon which the Sheriff
sold the Term so Devised to one Reynolds: Fulsehurst died; his Executor brought
Error, and reversed the Judgment given against the Testator at the Suit of
Beswick; the Wife re-entred, sold the Term, and died; Alice a Daughter of
Peerepoint, unpreferred, entered: And upon this matter found by Special Verdict
in the Common Pleas; The Entry of Alice was adjudged lawful. Upon which
Judgment, Error was brought in the Kings Bench: And it was argued upon the
words of the Devise, because here the Lease is not Devised, but all his
Interest in the thing Devised: And it is not like to the Case between Welden
and Elkington, 20 Eliz. Plow. Com. 519. where the Case was, that Davies being
Lessee for years, Devised, That his Wife should have and occupy his Land
demised for so many years as she should live. Nor unto the Case betwixt
Paramour and Yardley, 21 Eliz. Plow. Com. 539. For there the Lessee Devised,
That his Wife should have the Occupation and Profits of the Lands, until the
full age of his Son; For in those Cases, the Land it self is quodam modo
devised: But in our Case, all the Estate is Devised; i. e. the Lease it self.
And also in those two Devises, a certain person is named in the Will, who
should take the residue of the Term which should expire after the death of the
Wife; but in the Case at Bar, no person in certain is appointed, etc. but the
Devise as to that is conceived in general words, Children unpreferred; Ergo,
neither any Possibility, nor any Remainder is in any person certain; therefore
all the whole Term is entirely in the Wife, and then she may well dispose the
whole. But the whole Court was to the contrary, and that in this Case the
Possibility should rise well enough upon the death of the Wife, to the Daughter
Alice unpreferred. Another Point was moved; If the said Term being sold in the
possession of the Wife of the Devisor, by force of the Execution aforesaid; If
now the Judgment being reversed, the sale of the Term should be also avoided;
for now the party is to be restored to all that which he had lost. And by Cook
it was argued, That notwithstanding the reversal of the Judgment, the sale
should stand; For the Judgment for the Plaintiff in a Writ of Error is, That he
shall be restored to all that which he lost ratione Judicii praedict. and the
Judgment was, That the Plaintiff should recover 140 l. and therefore by the
Judgment in the Writ of Error, he shall be restored to so much; but the mean
Act, scil. the Sale of the Lease shall stand, and shall not be defeated and
avoided: As 7. H. 6. 42. A Statute Staple is bailed in Owel Mayn, the Conusee
brings Debt against the Bailee, and has Judgment to recover the Statute, and
upon that Suit he had Execution, and the Bailee brought a Writ of Error to
reverse the Judgment in Detinue, yet the Execution shall stand, and an Audita
Querela does not lie for the Conusor. And see 13 E. 3. Fitz. tit. Bar. 253.
Accomptant found in arrearages, committed to the Goal, escaped; and reversed
the Judgment given against him in the Account Ex part talis: yet an Action
upon the Escape did lie. And as to that Point, the whole Court was of the same
Opinion with Cook: But that Point did not come in Judgment: For by the sale,
nothing passed but the Interest in praesenti which was in the Wife of the
Devisor, but the Possibility to the Children unpreferred was not touched by it.
And afterward the Judgment was affirmed.

CXXIX. Bunny and Bunny's Case. Hill. 26 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
IN an Action of Covenant between Bunny and Bunny, the Plaintiff declared, That
the Defendant had Covenanted to find unto the Plaintiff, Meat and Drink at the
House of the Defendant. The Defendant pleaded, That he was always ready to find
the Plaintiff Meat and Drink, if he had come to his House to have taken it, Et
de hoc ponit se super Patriam: And it was found for the Plaintiff; And in this
Case, the Court awarded, That the parties should replead; For in all Cases
where the Defendant pleads matter of excuse not contained in the Declaration as
here, he shall say, Et hoc paratus est verificare, in the perclose of his Plea:
But if the Defendant had pleaded, That he had given the Plaintiff according to
the Covenant, Meat and Drink, then the Conclusion of his Plea had been good, Et
de hoc ponit se super Patriam, etc.

CXXX. Hill. 26 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
IN an Action upon the Case, supposing certain Goods to have come to the hands
of the Defendant, and that he had wasted them, and showed in what manner: The
Defendant pleaded Not guilty; And it was found by Verdict, That the Goods, etc.
came to the Defendants hands, and that he had wasted them, but in another
manner than the Plaintiff had declared: It was the Opinion of the whole Court,
That upon this Verdict, the Plaintiff should not have Judgment. As in an Action
of Trespass, the Plaintiff declared, That the Defendant had distrained his
Horse, and traveled riding upon him; And the Jury found, That the Defendant
did distrain the Horse, and killed him; In that case, it was holden, The
Plaintiff should not have Judgment. So in an Action upon the Case, the
Plaintiff declares upon a Promise upon one Consideration, and the Jury find the
Promise, but that it was upon another Consideration; in such case, the
Plaintiff shall not have Judgment. Adjudged for the Defendant.

CXXXI. Merry and Lewes's Case. Pasch. 26 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
MErry brought an Action upon the Case against William Jews, 2 Len. 53.
Executor of David Jews late Master of St. Katherines juxta London; And
Declared, That the said David, in Consideration, That whereas Quaedam pars
Domus fratrum and sororum Sanctae Katherinae fuit vitiosa and in decasu, the
said Merry ad requisitionem dicti Davidis repararet eandem, promised to pay the
said Merry all such moneys as the said Merry expenderet in such Reparations.
And declared further, That eandem partem Domus praedict. reparavit, etc. And
upon Non Assumpsit, It was found for the Plaintiff. It was Objected in Arrest
of Judgment, That the Declaration is too general, Quaedam pars Domus; For the
Plaintiff ought to have showed especially what part of the House in certainty,
as the Hall, Chamber, or other Rooms: But the Exception was disallowed. Another
Objection was, Because he set forth in the Declaration, That the Plaintiff ad
requisitionem dicti Davidis repararet; And the Plaintiff declares, That
reparavit generally, without saying, 2 Cro. 404.
That ad requisitionem Davidis reparavit: And that is not the Reparation
intended in the Consideration, i. e. reparatio ad requisitionem, etc. but a
Reparation of his own head, and at his pleasure. And for this Cause, the
Judgment was stayed.

CXXXII. Wrennam and Bullman's Case. Pasch. 26 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
2 Len. 52. 1 Len. 282.
WRennam brought an Action upon the Statute of 1 and 2 Phil. and Mar. against
Bullman, for unlawful impounding of Distresses; and was Nonsuit: It was moved
by Shuttleworth, Sergeant, If the Defendant should have Costs upon the Statute
of 23 H. 8. And it was Adjudged, That he should not; And that appears clearly
upon the words of the Statute, etc. for this Action is not conceived upon any
matter which is comprised within the said Statute; and also the Statute upon
which this Action is grounded, was made after the said Statute of 23 H. 8.
which gives Costs; and therefore the said Statute of 23 H. 8. and the remedy of
it cannot extend to any action done by 1 and 2 Phil. and Mary. And Rhodes,
Justice, said, It was so adjudged in 8 Eliz.

CXXXIII. Mich. 26 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
2 Len. 161. Dyer 291.
IN a Formedon of a Manor, The Tenant pleaded Ioynt-Tenancy by Fine with J.S.
The Demandant averred the Tenant sole Tenant as the Writ supposed; and upon
that it was found and tried for the Demandant: Upon which a Writ of Error was
brought; and Error assigned in this, Because where Ioynt-Tenancy is pleaded by
Fine, the Writ ought to have abated, without any Averment by the Demandant
against it, and the Averment had been received against Law, etc. Shuttleworth,
At the Common Law, If the Tenant had pleaded Ioynt-Tenancy by Deed, the Writ
should have abated, without any Averment; but that was remedied by the Statute
of 34 E. 1. But Ioynt-Tenancy by Fine does remain as it was at the Common Law;
For he has satis supplicii, because by his Plea, if it be false, he has by
way of Conclusion given the moiety of the Land in demand to him with whom he
has pleaded Ioynt-Tenancy: And the Law shall never intend that he would so
slightly depart with his Land for the abatement of a Writ. As in a Praecipe
quod reddat, the Tenant confesses himself to be a Villein of a stranger, the
Writ shall abate without any Averment Free, and of Free estate; for the Law
intends, that the Tenant will not inthral himself without cause. Wray, to the
same purpose; But the Demandant may confess and avoid the Fine; as to say, That
he who levied the Fine, was his Disseisor, upon whom he has before entered. And
if Tenant in Feesimple be impleaded, and he says, That he is Tenant for life,
the remainder over to A. in Fee, and prays in Aid of A. the Demandant shall
not take Averment, That the Tenant at the time of the Writ brought was seized
in Fee.

Note: In this Formedon, Ioynt-Tenancy was pleaded but as to parcel; And it was
holden by Wray and Southcote, That the whole Writ should abate, the whole Writ
against all the Defendants. And so where the Demandant enters into parcel of
the Land in demand, if the thing in demand be an entire thing, the Writ shall
abate in all. In this Writ, the Demandant ought to have averred in his Writ an
especial foreprise of the Land parcel of the Land in demand whereof the
Ioynt-Tenancy by the Fine is pleaded: For this dismembring of the Manor and
distraction of the Land of which the Ioynt-Tenancy is pleaded, is paravail and
under the gift whereof the Formedon is conceived; and therefore in respect of
the title of the Demandant, it remains in right parcel of the Manor, and
therefore ought to be demanded accordingly with a foreprise. But if A. gives
unto B. a Manor, except 10 Acres in tail, there, if after upon any
Discontinuance, the issue in tail is to have a Formedon; in such case, there
needs not any foreprise for the said 10 Acres, for they were severed from the
Manor upon the gift: But if Lands in demand be several, as 20 Acres, except 2
Acres, this foreprise is not good. See Temps E. 1. Fitz. Brief, 866. Praecipe,
etc. unam bovatam terrae forprise, one Sellion, and the Writ was abated, for
every demand ought to be certain: but a Sellion is but a parcel of Land
uncertain as to the quantity; in some places an Acre, in some more, in some
less. Another Point was, Because the Tenant has admitted, and accepted this
Averment; scil. sole Tenant as the Writ supposes And the Question was, If the
Court, notwithstanding the Admittance of the Tenant, ought without Exception of
the party Ex Officio, to abate the Writ? And it was the Opinion of Wray, Chief
Justice, That it should: For it is a positive Law, As if a Woman bring an
Appeal of Murder upon the death of her Brother, and the Defendant does admit it
without a Challenge or Exception, yet the Court ought to abate the Appeal, 10
E. 4. 7. See the principal Case there, Non ideo puniatur Dominus, etc. And if
an Action be brought against an Hostler upon the Common Custom of the Realm,
and in the Writ he is not named Common Hostler, yet the Court shall abate the
Writ Ex Officio. See 11 H. 4. and 38 H. 6. 42.

CXXXIV. Mich. 26 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
A. Seized of Lands in the right of his Wife for the Term of the life of the
Wife, made a Feoffment in Fee to the use of his said Wife for her life; It was
holden in that Case, That the Wife was remitted. And it is not like Amy
Townsends Case, Plow. Com. 1 and 2 Phil. and Mar. 111. For in the said Case the
Entry of the Wife was not lawful, for she was Tenant in tail; which Estate was
discontinued by the Feoffment of her Husband. And Periam, Justice, cited a
Case, Sidenham's Case; Bacon seized in the right of his Wife for the Term of
the life of the Wife; They both surrendered, and took back the Lands to them and
a third person: And it was holden, That the Wife was not presently remitted,
but after the death of her Husband she might disagree to the Estate.

CXXXV. Harper and Berrisford's Case. Mich. 26 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
IN a Writ of Partition, The Defendant demanded Judgment of the Writ, because
the Writ is, Quare-cum A. teneat, etc. pro indiviso, etc: 4 mill acras;
whereas it should be, Quatuor Mill acrarum. And many Grammarians were cited;
all which agreed, That it was good both ways; viz. Mill Acras, or Mill
Acrarum. And Rhodes, Justice, said, That Cowper, in Thesauro suo Linguae
Latinae, says, Quod Mill fere jungitur Genitivo, Ergo non semper. Wherefore
Anderson, with the assent of the other Justices, Ruled, That the Defendant
should answer over.

CXXXVI. Hering and Badlock's Case. Trin. 26 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
2 Len. 80.
IN a Replevin, the Defendant avowed for Damage-feasant; and showed, That the
Lady Jermingham was seized of such a Manor whereof the place where, etc. and
leased the same to the Defendant for years: The Plaintiff said, That long time
before, King Henry 8th was seized of the said Manor, and that the place where,
etc. is parcel of the said Manor Demised and Demiseable by Copy, etc. and that
the said King by such a one his Steward, demised and granted the said parcel to
the Ancestor of the Plaintiff, whose Heir he is by Copy in Fee, etc. And upon
that there was a Demurrer, because by this Bar to the Avowry, the Lease set
forth in the Avowry is not answered; for the Plaintiff in Bar to the Avowry,
ought to have concluded; and so was he seized by the Custom, until the Avowant
praetextu of the said Term for years, entered, etc. And so it was adjudged.

CXXXVII. Rosse's Case. Mich. 26 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
Ante 83.
IN Trespass brought by Rosse, for breaking of his Close, and beating of his
Servant, and carrying away of his Goods: Upon Not guilty pleaded, the Jury
found this special matter; scil. That Sir Thomas Bromley, Chancellor of
England, was seized of the Land where, etc. and leased the same to the
Plaintiff and one A. which A. assigned his moiety to Cavendish; by whose
Commandment the Defendant entered. It was moved, That that Tenancy in Common
betwixt the Plaintiff, and him in whose right the Defendant justifies, could
not be given in Evidence; and so it could not be found by Verdict, but it ought
to have been pleaded at the beginning. But the whole Court were clear of
another Opinion; and that the same might be given in Evidence well enough. It
was further moved against the Verdict, That the same did not extend to all the
points in the Declaration, but only to the breaking of the Close, without
enquiry of the battery, etc. And for that cause, it was clearly holden by the
Court, That the Verdict was void; And a Venire facias de novo was awarded.

CXXXVIII. Gurney and Saers Case. Trin. 26 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
AN Ejectione firmae was brought by Gurney against Saer; who pleaded, That
Verney was seized, and leased the same to Baker for 21 years, 8 Eliz. Baker, 14
Eliz. assigned his Interest to Rolls; who, 15 Eliz. leased the same to Topp for
10 years; and afterward Rolls granted the residue of his Term to A. Verney, 16
Eliz. leased the same Land to Stephen Gurney for 21 years, to begin after the
determination, surrender, or forfeiture of the first Lease, rendering Rent, with
Clause of Re-entry; And afterward Verney granted over the Reversion in Fee to
Hampden; To which Grant, A. and Topp attorned; Topp leased to B. at Will; A.
and Topp surrendered; B. held himself in by force of the Tenancy at Will: And
the said Surrender was made privily and secretly, without the notice of the
said Stephen Gurney; The Rent reserved upon the Lease made to Stephen Gurney is
demanded, as now begun by the said Surrender. Hampden entered as for the
Condition broken for the non-payment of the said Rent: And the Lease made to
the said Stephen Gurney was pleaded, Quod praedictus Johannes Verney per
Indenturam suam sigillo ipsius Stephani Gurney sigillat, demisit, etc. And that
was holden a material Exception; For here upon the matter does not appear any
Lease made by Verney. For here upon the pleading it appears, That Verney had
accepted a Deed of Gurney, purporting a Demise by Verney to Gurney, which
Gurney had sealed; but there did not appear any such Deed sealed by Verney, and
therefore no Lease ut supra. And although a Condition may be pleaded by
Indenture sealed with the seal of the other party, yet a Conveyance cannot be
pleaded by Deed as it is here, unless sealed with the seal of the party Agent;
scil. the Feoffor, Grantor, Lessor: And for that cause, Judgment was given for
the Plaintiff. Another Exception was taken, because that after the Grant of the
Reversion by Verney to Hampden, the surrender of A. and Topp is pleaded;
whereas A. ought not to surrender; for his Estate was not a Reversion for
years, but a Lease in Reversion, and a Lease for years to begin at a day to
come, which could not be surrendered. See 4 H. 7. 10. But if A. had granted his
Interest by way of Reversion, where Attornment had been, as one Releaseth to
him the Reversion for years, it is good; contrary to him who has a Lease in
Reversion. But as to that, it was said by the Court, That this surrender by A.
was good enough, for in as much as the Interest which A. had at the time of the
surrender was in Rolls a Reversion after his Grant to Topp, and there it
remained and continued in its nature as to that point; notwithstanding that by
the Grant it passed in another manner, than as a Reversion. Another Exception
was taken, because that in the pleading of the Surrender, it is not alleged,
That at the time of the Surrender, Hampden was seized of the Reversion. 7 E. 3.
3. He who claims by Cestuy que use, ought to allege the Seisin and Continuance
of Seisin to the said use at the time of the Feoffment or Grant,
notwithstanding that Seisin was alleged before. And 10 H. 7. 28. Hewbade's
Avowry, he there pleaded, That A. was seized of a Manor, and thereof levied a
Fine to B. and that C. the Tenant upon whom the Avowry was made, attorned, etc.
And Exception taken, because it is not showed in the Avowry, That B. the
Conusee was seized of the Manor at the time of the Attornment. And it was
holden a good Exception. On the other side it was said, and affirmed by the
Court, That in all Cases where an Inheritance is once alleged in a Man, the
Law shall presume the Continuance of it there, until the contrary be showed.
See 1 Eliz. the Case between Wrotesley and Adams, Plow. Com. 193. And 15 Eliz.
between Smith and Stapleton, Plow. 431. Which Wray and Gaudy, Justices,
granted: Ayliff, Justice, to the contrary. Another point was moved, If upon
this secret Surrender notice ought to have been given to Gurney, who had an
Interest for years to begin upon the said Surrender; For some conceived, That
Gurney, without notice given him of the said Surrender, should not be
prejudiced by the Condition aforesaid. And of that Opinion clearly was Wray,
Chief Justice,

Note, In this Case, That Saer, the Defendant, presently after the Judgment
entered, cast in a Writ of Error into the Court; and assigned an Error in fact;
scil. That Gurney the Plaintiff in the first Action within age, appeared by
Attorney; whereas he ought by Gardein or Prochein Amy. And it was the Opinion of
the Justices upon the first Motion, That that matter could not be assigned for
Error; for it is not within the Record, and we cannot reverse our own Judgment,
but only for matter of Process. See for that, Fitzh. Na. Br. 21. f.

CXXXIX. Partridge and Pooles Case. Pasch. 26 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
TRespass of Battery was brought by Partridge against Poole, 2 Len. 79. 1 Cro.
842.
and supposed the Battery at D. in the County of Middlesex; The Defendant
justified by reason of an Assault at S. in the County of Gloucester, absque
hoc, that he beat the Plaintiff at D. in the County of Middlesex: Upon which
traverse, the Plaintiff did demur in Law. It was argued by Popham the Queens
Attorney General, That the traverse of the County is good: And he put the Case
of 21 H. 6. 8 and 9. In Trespass of Battery at D. in the County of York; the
Defendant justified by an Assault at London in such a place in such a Parish,
etc. absque hoc, that he was guilty de aliqua transgressione in Comitatu
Eborum. Upon which issued a Venire facias into Yorkshire; and, as the Book is,
This traverse as to the County was taken with great deliberation. See also 22
E. 4. 39. And this traverse de jure ought to be allowed; For the Jury in
Middlesex are not bound to find the Assault in the County of Gloucester. See 2
Mar. Br. Jurours, 50. In Actions upon transitory matters, although they be
laid in Foreign Counties, yet the Jurors if they will, may thereof give their
Verdict, but they are not bound to do it. Egerton, Solicitor General, to the
contrary: And he put a difference, where the justification is local, and where
transitory: As in False Imprisonment, the Defendant justifies as Sheriff the
taking of the Plaintiff by force of a Capias directed to him at D. within his
County of G. Where the Plaintiff declares of an Imprisonment in another
County; there the traverse of the County is good, for the Defendant cannot take
the Plaintiff by force of the said Process in any other County than where he is
Sheriff; and so the Justification is local, 11 H. 4. 157. But in our Case, the
matter of the Justification is merely transitory. And at last, after many
Motions, It was adjudged for the Plaintiff. Gaudy, Justice, being of a contrary
Opinion: And by Wray, Chief Justice, clearly, The Jurors upon pain of Attaint,
are to take notice of such a transitory thing done in another County. See 2
Mar. Br. Attaint, 104. 9 H. 6. 63.

CXL. Gerrard's Case. Pasch. 26 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
2 Len. 168. 4 Len. 7.
GErrard, Master of the Rolls, presented Chatterton Bishop of Chester, to the
Church of Bangor; to which Church also, one Chambers presented his Clerk; by
which several Presentiments, the same Church became Litigious: The Archbishop of
York being Ordinary of the place, awarded Jure Patronatus, etc. depending
which, the Archbishop admitted the said Bishop; upon which, the said Chambers
Libelled in the Spiritual Court, against the said Bishop; For that the said
Archbishop praedicto Episcopo plus aequo fidens, admisit dictum Episcopum,
pendente the Jure Patronatus; in which Case by the Law of the Church, the
Admittance is void; For, pendente Lite nihil movetur. And now came the said
Bishop, and upon this matter prayed a Prohibition; and he had it, because that
the right of the Patronage came in debate. After which came the said Chambers,
and prayed a Consultation, because he meddled not with the right of Patronage,
but only with the wrongful admittance. To whom it was said by the Court, That
the awarding of the Jure Patronatus, is not a thing of necessity, but at the
Will of the Ordinary, and for his better Instruction: But if he will at his
peril take notice of the right of the Patronage, he may receive which of them
he will, without a Jure Patronatus awarded. And it may be, in this Case, That
after the Jure Patronatus awarded, and before any Verdict given upon it, the
Archbishop was satisfied of the right of the now Plaintiff in the Prohibition
to the Patronage, and thereupon admitted the Clerk; And by the clear Opinion of
the Court, the Consultation was denied.

CXLI. Rampston and Bowmer's Case. Trin. 26 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
IN an Action upon the Case, the Plaintiff declared, That whereas the Plaintiff
occupied a Brew House; And whereas one Gilbert Bowmer was the Beer-Clark of it,
and had the government and disposition of the Beer brewed there, by reason
whereof he became indebted to the Plaintiff in such a sum; For which the
Plaintiff procured the said Gilbert to be Arrested, and put into the Prison of
the Marshalsey; And whereas the said Gilbert in dicta prisona existente, the
Defendant tunc and ibidem in Consideration that the said Plaintiff would let
the said Gilbert out of Prison, Promised, That if the said Gilbert should not
account with the Plaintiff, and pay him all the Arrearages, which upon such
Account should be found before such a day, That then the Defendant would pay
it: Upon which the said Gilbert was dismissed ad largum: And further declared,
That no Account had been made by Gilbert, or any other satisfaction. And upon
Non Assumsipt, the Jury found, That the said Gilbert so endebted to the
Plaintiff, was arrested at the Suit of the Plaintiff; and that after, the
Defendant came unto the Baily of the Marshal who arrested the said Gilbert, and
took upon him to the said Baily, That the said Gilbert should be at the next
Court holden for the said Marshalsey; by force and reason of which promise, the
Baily suffered the said Gilbert to go at large to his House, etc. and that
after and before such Court, the Defendant promised the Plaintiff modo and
forma, as the Plaintiff had surmised in his Declaration: And upon that Verdict,
the Plaintiff could not have Judgment; For here the Consideration laid in the
Declaration is not found by the Verdict; For Gilbert was discharged of the
Imprisonment before the promise of the Defendant to the Plaintiff: And the
Declaration is, That in Consideration quod dictus Gilbertus ad largum
dimitteretur, etc. And Judgment was given Quod Querens Nihil Capiat per Billam.

CXLII. Mich. 26 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
ONe recovered certain Copyhold Lands in the Court of the Lord of the Manor by
plaint in the nature of a Writ of Right: It was moved in the Common Pleas, If a
Precept might be made and awarded out of that Court for to execute the said
Recovery, and to put him in possession who recovered, with the Posse Manerii,
as in such Cases at the Common Law, with the Posse Comitatus. But it was
clearly Resolved, It could not be done; For force in such cases is not
justifiable, but by Command out of the Kings Courts.

CXLIII. Iplett and Williams's Case. Mich. 26 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
I Plett brought an Action upon the Case against Williams, and declared,
Whereas one J. had affirmed a Plaint of Debt against the Plaintiff in the
Queens Court of her Manor of D. in the County of Cornwall; and demanded
against him 100 l. And whereas the Defendant now Plaintiff sued a Corpus cum
Causa, etc. and delivered the same to the now Defendant, being then
Vnder-Steward of the said Court, That notwithstanding that the now Defendant
proceeded to Judgment, and awarded Execution against the Plaintiff and his
Sureties, by force of which the Goods of the Plaintiff and of his Sureties were
taken in Execution; Upon which Declaration, the Defendant demurred in Law,
because the Judgment was given in a Court Baron, which could not hold plea
above the sum of 40 s. And notwithstanding that Exception, and notwithstanding
also that the Action was brought against the Vnder-Steward, etc. The Plaintiff
had Judgment to Recover.

CXLIV. Denton and Goddard's Case. Pasch. 26 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
DEbt was brought against Denton Administrator of the Goods and Chattels of
James Newton; and the Plaintiff declared upon an Obligation made to the
Intestate bearing date the 4th day of April, 24 Eliz. The Defendant prayed Oyer
of the Deed and Condition; and then pleaded to the Action: For he said, That
the aforesaid James Newton, ante Confectionem praedicti suppositi scripti,
scilicet ultimo die Septembris 23 Eliz. apud N. obiit, and so Non est factum,
etc. The Jury found, That the said Deed was delivered to the Intestate 3 July,
23 Eliz. in the life of the Intestate, bearing date 24 Aprilis, 24 Eliz. before
which day, the Intestate died: And upon the whole matter, Judgment was given
for the Plaintiff.

CXLV. Lichfield and Gage's Case. Pasch. 26 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
2 Len. 167.
IN an Ejectione firmae the parties were at Issue; And by Order of the Court,
the Trial was stayed: And yet the Plaintiff against the Order, obtained privily
a Nisi Prius: Upon which Gaudy, Justice, being informed of it after the Term,
awarded a Supersedeas to the Justices of Assise, before whom, etc. And
notwithstanding that, the Enquest at the Instance of the Plaintiff, was taken,
and found for the Plaintiff. All this matter was showed to the Court, in the
Kings Bench, and there examined and proved; And it was Ordered by the Court,
That the Verdict should not be entered of Record, nor any Judgment upon it: And
so was it put in execution in a Case between Vernon and Fowler. And then the
Counsel moved and took Exception to the Supersedeas, because it was not
subscribed by the hand of Justice Gaudy. But it was not allowed, because his
Seal was sufficient.

CXLVI. Fuller and Cook's Case. Pasch. 26 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
1 Roll. 111.
IN an Action upon the Case, the Plaintiff declared, That the Defendant had
informed one Tho. Colby a Justice of the Peace, That the Plaintiff had stolen
the Defendants Hoggs; By force of which, the said Colby ad Querimoniam
Defendentis, made a Warrant, and directed it to the Constable of H. to
apprehend the Plaintiff, and to bring him before the said Colby; By force of
which, the Plaintiff was Arrested, and brought before the said Colby, and there
was examined upon the said matter, and bound over by Recognizance to appear at
the next Sessions, and there to Answer; at which Sessions he appeared; And
Proclamation was made, That if any one would inform against the Plaintiff, etc.
and none came; For which the Plaintiff was discharged, and so by this matter he
was discredited, etc. And all this matter was found by Special Verdict; And
thereupon Judgment was given for the Plaintiff. And in this Case the Court took
a difference, Where one whose Goods a stolen comes to are Justice of Peace,
and shows him the matter, and prays that the matter be examined and that such a
one is examined upon it; here in this case, No Action lies. But if such a
person in such case will expressly say, That such a one has stolen, etc. Hob.
192.
and procure a Warrant from a Justice of Peace upon such Surmise to arrest the
party; upon such matter, an Action upon the Case will lie.

CXLVII. The Queen and the Lord Lumley's Case. Trin. 26 Eliz. In the Exchequer.
IT was moved in the Exchequer, 2 Len. 80. Hob. 304.
That Queen Mary seized of the Rectory of D. granted Advocationem Ecclesiae de
D. If now by this Grant, the Advowson should pass as now disappropriate; Or
that the Rectory it self should pass as appropriate; Or that nothing at all
should pass? And by Manwood, Chief Baron, the Advowson shall not pass, but
remain appropriate as it was before: For the Church as it was appropriate by a
Judicial act, so without such an Act it cannot be disappropriate. And he said,
That by the Grant of the said Advowson, the Rectory did not pass; For by the
Appropriation, the Advowson was gone, and it was not in esse, and by
consequence, could not be granted: And it is not within the Statute of 4 and 5
Philip and Mary, of Confirmations of Grants of the King; For the said Statute
helps not, but misrecital, misnaming, etc. But here there is not such a thing
in rerum natura, as the Patentee pretends to be passed by the Letters Patents;
And if it were in the Case of a Common person, nothing should pass; As it was
adjudged in Sands Case, 11 Eliz. And he said, That at this time a Parsonage
might be disappropriated; but that ought to be by a Judicial Act; as by
Presentment, and not by any private Act of the Proprietor: And so he said, a
Church was disappropriated by the Lord Dyer, by a Presentment which of late he
made to it.

CXLVIII. Cox's Case. Mich. 26 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
IN Debt upon an Obligation against Cox, the Case was; A Parson made a Lease
for years, and became bounden to the Lessee, to perform the Covenants in the
Lease: The Defendant pleaded, That the Lease is void, by the Statute of 14
Eliz. because he was absent from his Benefice above the space of 80 days; part
of which time encurred depending the Action, and before the Pea was pleaded: It
was the Opinion of the Court, That the Plea was good. But Exception was taken
to the pleading; The Defendant says, That the said Church is a Parochial
Church cum Cura animarum, but does not say. That it was so at the time of the
Lease and Obligation made: For it may be, that at the time of the Lease there
was a Vicar; and then it was not Cura animarum. And afterward upon that
Exception, Judgment was given for the Plaintiff.

CXLIX. Wroth and Capell's Case. Pasch. 26 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
4 Len. 197.
THe Case was; A. was Indicted upon the Statute of 8 H. 6. And Exception was
taken to the Indictment, because no word of Freehold was in it; or to prove,
that the party grieved had any Freehold whereof he might be disseised. But
because the words of the Indictment were, Expulit and disseisivit, which could
not be true, if the party expelled and disseised had not Freehold; the
Exception was disallowed. Another Exception was taken to the Indictment; For
these words, In unum tenementum intravit; and this word Tenementum, is too
general, and an uncertain word; and therefore as to that, the party was
discharged. But the Indictment was further, In unum Tenementum and december acras
terrae eidem pertinent. And therefore as to the 10 Acres, the party was
enforced to Answer.

CL. Pasch. 26 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
A. Granted to B. a Rentcharge out of his Lands, to begin when J.S. died
without Issue of his body; J.S. died, having Issue; which Issue died without
Issue. Dyer said, The Grant shall not take effect; For J.S. at the time of his
death had Issue: and therefore then the Grant shall not begin; and if not then,
then not at all. And by Manwood, If the words had been, To begin when J.S. is
dead without Issue of his body, then such a Grant should take effect when the
Issue of J.S. dies without Issue, etc. Dyer, If the Donee in tail has Issue,
and dies without Issue, The Formedon in Reverter shall suppose that the Donee
himself died without Issue; For there is an Interest, and there is a difference
betwixt an Interest and a Limitation: For if I give Lands to A. and B. for the
Term of their lives, if any of them dies, the Survivor shall have the whole.
But if I give Lands to A. for the life of B. and C. now, if B. or C. die, all
the Estate is determined, because but a Limitation, and B. and C. had not any
Interest. See Cook 5 Part, Bradnell's Case.

CLI. Pasch. 26 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
A. Enfeoffed B. upon Condition, That if he pay 10. l. to the Feoffee, his
Executors or Assigns, 4 Len. 232. 1 Len. 285, 286. Hill. 12. Car. 2 B.R.
Goodyer and Clarks Case.
within 3 years next ensuing, that then it should be lawful for him and his
Heirs to re-enter. The Feoffee has Issue two Sons, whom he makes his
Executors, and dies before the day of payment. The Ordinary commits ^etters of
Administration to J.S. during the minority of the Executors. Manwood conceived,
That it is a most sure way for A. to pay the Moneys to the Executors, for they
remain Executors notwithstanding the Administration committed to another: For
the Administrator in such case is but as Bailiff or Receivor to the Executors,
and shall be accomptable to them; Which Harper and Dyer, Concesserunt: And
Manwood said, If in this Case the Moneys be paid to one of the Executors, it is
sufficient, and the same well paid; but that Conditional Feoffments are as a
Sum in gross, and not in nature of a Debt: Which the rest of the Justices
granted.

CLII. Pasch. 26 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
A. Seized of a Manor seized the same for years, rendering Rent, with Clause of
re-entry; and afterward levied a Fine Sur Conusans de Droit, to the use of
himself and his Heirs; The Rent being demanded, is behind. Dyer, A. cannot
re-enter; for although in right the Rent passes without Attornment, yet he is
without remedy; for it is without Attornment: and it would be hard without
Attornment to re-enter, etc.

It was moved further, If here the Conusor be Assignee within the Statute of 32
H. 8. Manwood, The Reversion of a Termor is granted by Fine, there wants
privity for an Action of Debt, Waste, and Re-entry: But if the Conusee dies
without Heir, although that in right it was in the Conusee; yet the Lord by
Escheat shall make Avowry, and yet the Conusee by whom he claims, could not.
And in the Case at Bar, the Conusee himself could not, but the Conusor being
Cestuy que use, who is in by the Act of Law, 1 Inst. 309.
shall avow, and shall re-enter without Attornment: For the Conusor is in by
the Statute of 27 H. 8. Harper, The Heir of the Conusee shall avow and re-enter
before Attornment. Dyer, 13 H. 4. The Father leaseth for years rendering Rent,
with Clause of re-entry; the Father demands the Rent, which is not paid; the
Father dies, the Son cannot re-enter, For the Rent does not belong unto him:
And therefore in the Case at Bar, the Conusee cannot avow for the Rent before
Attornment; therefore not re-enter.

CLIII. Trin. 26 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
IT is Enacted by the Statute of 5 Eliz. Cap. 8. That no person shall cut down
any Oak Trees but between the first day of April, and the last day of June, but
Timber employed and bestowed in or about Buildings or Reparations of Houses,
etc. And upon an Information upon that Statute, the Defendant pleaded, That he
cut down the said Oak Trees and thereof made Laths to be bestowed in building,
and that he had sold them to J.S. who had employed part of them in building,
and is employing the residue in the same manner. Windham, The intent of the
Defendant in cutting down the Oaks, was not to have them employed in building,
but to sell them: Although it is not necessary for the satisfaction of that
Statute, that the Oaks presently after the cutting be employed about building;
For if the Lessee of a Message, who is to have House-bote, seeing that his
Message will want reparation, cutteth down a Tree for such intent, although
there be not such urgent occasion at present, that it ought to be presently
repaired, the same shall not be said Trespass; for it is good Husbandry to have
such Timber to be seasonable, which cannot be, without some reasonable time
between the cutting down and the employment. Periam, If at the time of the
cutting, the Vendor or Vendee had an intent to employ them about building, it
is good enough: And it is a strong Case here, because the Defendant imploys the
Timber himself in Laths, which is not of any use but for building; and cannot
be made but of Timber.

CLIV. Eve and Finch's Case. Trin. 26 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
PEter Eve and John Finch brought an Action of Trespass against Nathaniel Tracy
and Margaret his Wife: and upon the pleading, the Case was, that John Finch,
Father of J.F. the Plaintiff, seized of the Manor of St. Katherines, held the
same of the Queen by Knight service in Chief, and was also seized of the Land
where the Trespass was done, being holden in Socage; and so seized, 6 Junij, 20
Eliz. for the preferment of the said Margaret then his Wife, enfeoffed of the
said Manor A. and B. unto the use of himself and the said Margaret, and their
Heirs. And that the said John the Father had not any other Land but that before
mentioned; and that the said Manor at the time of the said Feoffment, and at
the death of the said John the Father attingebat ad duas parts of all the
Lands and Tenements of the said John the Father in three parts to be divided.
And afterward, the Father by his Will devised the Lands holden in Socage, unto
his said Wife for life, with diverse Remainders over: It was the Opinion of the
Court in this Case, that the Devise was utterly void by the Statute.

CLV. Brett and Peagrims Case. Pasch. 26 Eliz.
IN an Action upon the Case, the Plaintiff declared, that whereas he himself
and the Defendant submitted themselves to the Award of A.B. and C.D. and
whereas the said Arbitrators upon the hearing of the Causes between them, did
intend, and were resolved, amongst other matters of their Award, to award, that
two Obligations by which the Plaintiff was severally bounden to the Defendant
for the payment of certain sums of Money to the Defendant, should be delivered
by the Defendant to the Plaintiff to be cancelled: The Defendant promised, in
Consideration, that that Article of the delivery of the said two Obligations
should be left out of the Award, that he himself would gratis deliver them to
the Plaintiff without any Coertion or direction of the Award: and further
declared, that the said Article ad specialem instantiam ipsius Querentis was
left out by the said Arbitrators out of their Award; and notwithstanding that,
that the Defendant had not redelivered, ut supra, etc. but had put the same in
suit against the Plaintiff. In this Case, upon the matter, ut supra, etc. it
was adjudged for the Plaintiff.

CLVI. Nich. Lee's Case. Pasch. 26. Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
1 Cro. 26. 1 Len. 285. 1 Inst. 113. Dyer 177. 219. a. 2 Len. 220.
NIch. Lee by his Will devised his Land to W. his second Son; And if he do
depart this World, not having Issue, then I Will my Sons-in-Law shall sell my
Land. The Devisor at the time of the Devise having six Sons-in-Law, died; W.
had Issue John and died; John died without Issue; one of the Sons-in-Law of the
Devisor died; the five surviving Sons-in-Law sold the Land. 1. It was clearly
agreed by the whole Court, that although the words of the Will be, ut supra, If
W. my Son depart this World, not having Issue, etc. And that W. has Issue
which dies without Issue, there although it cannot be said Literally, that
William did depart this World not having Issue; yet the intent of the Devisor
is not to be restrained to the Letter; but Construction shall be made, that
whenever W. dies (in Law upon the matter) without Issue, the same Land shall
be subject to sale according to the Authority committed by the Devisor to his
Sons-in-Law: And now upon the matter W. is dead without Issue. As in a Formedon
in the Reverter or Remainder, although the Donee in tail has Issue, yet if
afterward the Estate tail be spent, the Writ shall suppose, that the Donee
died without Issue: a fortiori in the case of a Devise, such Construction shall
be made.

As to the other point concerning the sale of the Land, Wray demanded, if the
Sons-in-Law were named in the Will? The Clerks answered, they were not. See 30
H. 8. Br. Devise, 31 and 39 Ass. 17. Fitz. title, Executors, 117. Such a sale
is good in case of Executors. See also, 23 Eliz. Dyer, 371. And see 4 and 5
Mar. Dyer, Land devised in tail, and if the Devisee shall die without Issue,
that then the Land shall be sold pro optimo valor by his Executors una cum
assensu of A. if A. dies before sale, the power of the Executors is
determined. And afterward it was clearly resolved by the whole Court, that the
sale, by the manner aforesaid was good; and Judgment given accordingly.

CLVII. Rag and Bowley's Case. Trin. 26 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
ERror was brought upon a Fine, and the Error was assigned in the
Proclamations: Whereupon issued a Certiorari to the Custos Brevium, who
certified the Proclamations; by which Certificate it appeared, that two of the
said Proclamations were made in one day: upon which the Defendant prayed
another Scire facias to the Chirographer; in whose Office it appeared, that all
the Proclamations were well and duly made. It was the Opinion of Wray, Chief
Justice, in this Case, that the Defendant ought to have his preyer; for the
Chirographer makes the Proclamations, and he is the principal Officer as to
them. And the Custos Brevium, has but the abstract of the Proclamations; and
we may in discretion amend them upon the matter appearing. But the other
Justices seemed to be of a contrary Opinion; for that the Proclamations being
once certified by the Custos Brevium, who is the principal Officer, we ought
not afterward to resort to the Chirographer, who is the inferior Officer: And
afterward, the Clerks of the Common Pleas were examined of the matter
aforesaid by the Justices of the Kings Bench; and they answered according to
that which was said by Wray, Chief Justice. Wherefore it was awarded by the
Court, that a new Certiorari be directed to the Chirographer: who Certified the
Proclamations to be well and duly made. And thereupon the Court awarded, that
the Proclamations in the Office of the Custos Brevium, should be amended
according to the Proclamations in the Custody and the Office of the
Chirographer.

Note, In the same Case, before the Writ brought, a stranger had brought a Writ
of Error against the same Defendant upon the same Fine; upon which the
transcript of the Fine and Proclamations are removed in Banco, and after the
Plaintiff is Nonsuit. Now another who has Cause, may have a Writ of Error,
quod coram vobis residet.

CLVIII. Taverner and Cromwell's Case. Trin. 26 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
UPon an Evidence unto a Jury, 3 Cro. 353.
containing difficulty and matter in Law; it was found, viz. that the Bishop of
Norwich, 10 H. 8. was seized of the Manor of Northelman in the right of his
Bishopric; and, at his Court holden within the same Manor, granted parcel of
the Demesnes of the said Manor to one Taverner and his Heirs, where, of the
said Land in truth, there was not any Demise by Copy before: And so the said
Land continued in Copy until 23 H. 8. at which time, Taverner committed a
forfeiture; which being presented, the Bishop seized the Land as forfeited; and
granted the same again by Copy to Taverner in Fee: And so from thence it
continued in Copy until 8 Eliz. (which Interval between 23 H. 8. and 8 Eliz.
amounted to 47 years:) It was the Opinion of the whole Court in this Case, that
the Continuance for 50 years, is requisite to fasten a Customary Condition upon
the Land against the Lord. It was also agreed by the Court, that although the
Original Commencement, and that Customary Interest did commence 10 H. 8. ut
supra, from which time, unto 8 Eliz. 60 years passed; yet the seizure for a
forfeiture which happened 23 H. 8. interrupted utterly the Continuance from the
time which might by the Law have perfected the Customary Interest. So that now,
the time before the forfeiture ought not to be accounted in this Case: But the
Orginal beginning of the Copyhold shall be holden to be 23 H. 8. when the Grant
de Novo by Copy was made; between which time, and 8 Eliz. is an interval but of
47 years; within which time, a Customary Interest cannot be attached upon the
Land: And then before sufficient time encurred, etc. the Lord may well enter
upon such a Tenant at Will: For as yet, there is not any Custom begotten by
sufficient time to bind him. It was also agreed by the Justices, That if the
Lord of a Manor is seized of an ancient Copyhold for forfeiture, or by reason
of Escheat, and Let the same at Will without any Copy for diverse years, one
after the other, that that is not any Interruption of the Customary nature of
the Land; but that the Lord may grant it again by Copy.

As to other parcel of the Land, It was given in Evidence, That at a Court
lately holden at Northelman, It was presented by the Homage there, That
Taverner the Plaintiff being a Copyholder of the said Manor, had forged a
Customary of the said Manor, containing diverse false Customs, pretending them
to be true Customs of the said Manor, and that he had forged, and put a Seal
to it, about which, this word, viz. (Northelman) is engraven; And that he had
procured diverse Copyholders of the said Manor to set their seals to it; and
that he said unto them, That that Customary should be put into the Church of
Northelman amongst the Charters and Evidences of the said Church: And that he
had now made his Copyhold as good as his Freehold. And, If the said Offense
committed by the Plaintiff, ut supra, be a forfeiture of his Copyhold, was the
Question? It was argued by Popham, who was of Counsel with the Plaintiff, That
without further matter, it was not any forfeiture; And yet he confessed, It is
a forgery against the first branch of that Statute of 5 Eliz. cap. 14. And so
he said it was lately adjudged in the Star Chamber: But as to the point of
Forfeiture, he put this difference; If the Lord demand his Services of his
Copyholder, there, If the Copyholder upon debate between the Lord and himself,
shows forth such a forged Customary, and Counterpleads the Demand of the Lord
with it; now it is a forfeiture, for that the Inheritance of the Lord is
thereby hazarded: As, if the Copyholder after the forfeiture keep it himself,
and does not encounter his Lord in his demand with it in his services, the same
is not any forfeiture: As, if the Copyholder, before any Rent be due, says,
That he will not pay any Rent to the Lord hereafter: Or when a Court is to be
holden, That he will not after appear to do any Suit at the Court of his Lord,
etc. But if, his Rent being due, he denies it; Or when the Court is holden, he
says, That he will not do any Suit; the same is a foreiture: As it was lately
adjudged in the Kings Bench, in the Case between Sir Christopher Hatton, and
his Copyholders of his Manor of Wellingborough. So if a Copyholder being with
the other Copyholders charged upon Oath to enquire of the Articles of the
Court Baron, and sufficient matter being given to them in Evidence, to induce
them to find a matter within their Charge, and they or any of them obstinately
refuse to find the same, the same is a forfeiture of his Copyhold; As it was
adjudged in the Case of Sir Rich. Southwell, Knight, and Thurston. Clench,
Justice, conceived, That in the principal Case, the Offense of the Plaintiff,
is not any forfeiture, no more, 1 Roll. 508.
than if a Copyholder makes a Charter of Feoffment of his Customary Land, and
delivers the same as his Deed to the party, but does not execute it by
Livery, the same is not any forfeiture. It was argued by Gaudy, Sergeant, who
was of Counsel with the Defendant, to the contrary: For he said, That if a
Copyholder will forge a Deed of Feoffment, purporting, That the Lord of the
Manor has enfeoffed him of the said Customary Land, notwithstanding that he
keeps such Charter himself, without showing it forth, yet it is a Forfeiture.
At the length, The Court wished the Jury to find the special matter, and to
refer the same to the Court, Whether it was a Forfeiture, or not. In this Case,
another matter was moved, viz. The Auncestor of the Plaintiff had purchased
diverse several Copyholds from several Copyholders by several Copies whereof he
died seized; Or committed several Offenses by which he forfeited to the Lord
all his Copyholds, for which the Lord seized, and grants them again to his
Auncestor wtih the Ancient Rent, and to his Heirs, Tenendum per antiqua
servitia and consueta, etc. And afterward, the same Copyholder commiteth
Waste, whether the same shall now trench to forfeit all the Copyhold Lands
which were granted ut supra, by one entire Copy; Or only that which was before
the seizure holden by the same Rent, Et nihil ultra: For these words, Tenendum
per antiqua servitia, do not trench only to the Quantity of the Services, but
also to the Quality; scil. severally, so as there shall be several Services as
before: As if A. be seized of Copyhold Land on the part of his Father, and of
other Copyhold Land on the part of his Mother, and thereof dies seized, and
his Son and Heir be admitted to it by one Copy, and by one Admittance; Now if
that Son dies without Issue, the Copyholds shall descend severally, the one to
the Heir on the part of his Father, and the other to the Heir on the part of
his Mother, etc. And afterward the Jury found the Special Verdict, and the
special matter, ut supra, etc

CLIX. Vincent Lee's Case. Trin. 26 Eliz. In the Exchequer.
1 Inst. 138. b.
VIncent Lee seized of Lands in Fee, had Issue 3 Sons, F.G. and J: and by his
last Will in writing Devised, That J. his Son should have the Land for the Term
of 31 years, without impeachment of Waste, to the intent that he pay certain
Debts and Legacies set down in his said Will, The remainder after the said Term
expired to the Heirs Males of the Body of the said J. begotten. And further
willed, That if the said J. die within the Term aforesaid, that then G. his Son
shall have such Term, etc. and then also shall be Executor; but made the said
J. his present Executor, and died, J. entered by force of the Devise: F. died
without Issue, by which the Feesimple descended upon J. who had Issue P. and
died within the Term, P. entered; G. as Executor entered upon him; and he
re-entred; upon which re-entry, G. brought Trespass. Pigott said, That the Term
by the descent of the Fee from F. to J. being the second Son of Vincent, and
Heir of F. is not extinct, but only suspended. It has been Objected, that J.
cannot be said to die within the Term, because by the descent of the Fee, the
Term is extinct, or suspended, and so not in esse at the time of the death of
J. therefore nothing did accrue to G. because J. did not die within the Term:
but that is but a Conceit; for the intent of Vincent was, that the Heir should
not meddle with the Land Devised as Heir, until the 31 years be expired: and
words, During, or Within the Term, extend unto the time of the Term, and not
unto the Estate: And although, that the Term as to J. be extinct, yet the right
or possession of G. shall stand, and shall be expectant upon the death of J.
before the expiration of the said 31 years. As, A. leaseth for life to B. and
afterward grants the Reversion with Warranty to C. who releaseth to B. in
Fee, who is impleaded in a Praecipe: although now B. has a Feesimple, yet
during his life he shall not recover in value. And in the principal Case, This
further Interest limited to G. cannot be extinct or prevented. See Plow. Com.
Welden and Elkingtons Case. Beaumont, contrary. And that the Term is extinct,
because he has the said Term in his own right, and not as Executor, but as a
Man trusted with payment of Debts and Legacies; But the same Term which J. had,
G. cannot have, for some of the years are expired; and the words of the Will
are, He shall have such Term; but here the Term is utterly extinct: As where a
Rent, Common, or Way, etc. descends upon the Ter-Tenant; 2 H. 4. A Prior had
an Annuity out of a Parsonage, and afterward he purchases the Advowson, which
is afterward appropriated to his House; now the Annuity is extinct; and
although the Prior afterward presents to the Advowson, yet it is-not
revived; Br. Extinguishment, 54. A Man has a Lease for years as Executor, and
purchases the Inheritance, his Term is extinct, yet it is Assets, etc. And it
is said in Bracebridges Case, Plow. Com. 419. 14 Eliz. that Parson, Patron and
Ordinary, Lease for years the Glebe Lands of the Parsonage; the Parson dies;
the Lessee for years becomes Parson and dies, his Executors shall not have the
residue of the said Term; for the Term is extinct, 1 Inst. 338. b. 2 Roll. 472.
although he had the Term in his own right, and the Freehold in the right of
his Church; and so in several Capacities. And it was holden by some, that if
the Term for years comes to the Lessor as Executor, who dies, the Term is
revived. Manwood, Chief Baron, asked this Case of those who Argued; A Lease is
made for 21 years, Proviso, That the Lessee shall suffer the Lessor to enjoy
the same, or to take the profits thereof during the life of the Lessor, or so
long as the Lessor shall live; if the same were a good Proviso, or not? Pigot
Conceived, that the Devise to G. was a new Devise, and not dependant upon the
first Devise to J. nor any parcel of it; but this second Devise to G. did take
away the absolute Devise to J. before, and qualified it, so as it determined
with his death. The words, Such Estate, shall be intended an Estate to G. to be
granted from the death of the Testator. Land is Devised to A. and his Heirs,
and he if dies without Heir, that it shall remain to another; the same is no
good Devise: But a Devise to one and his Heirs, and if J.S. dies living the
Devisee, B. shall have it; the same is good: for it is a new Devise, and an
Estate created de Novo, and does not depend as a Remainder upon the first
Devise, or upon the first Estate devised; as the Case is, 29 Ass. 17. Br.
Condition, 111. and Devise, 16. So here are several Estates limited, one to J.
and another to G. which Estate of G. cannot be extinct by unity of possession
in J. These words, If he die within the Term, shall be construed for Effluxion
of the time of 31 years, and not for the Termination of the Term. Cooper,
Sergeant, to the contrary; J. took this Term as purchasor, and not as Executor,
for that no Term was in the Testator. See 14 Eliz. Dyer, 309. Granmer's Case;
G. shall have such Term and Interest as before I have willed unto J. Manwood,
Such Term, that is to say, The Residue of the Term.

Now at another day, the Barons delivered their Opinions, that the Plaintiff
should recover, and that was now G. to whom the second Term was devised: And by
Manwood, in Construction of Wills, all the words of the Will are to be compared
together, so as there by not any repugnancy between all the parts of the Will,
or between any of them, so that all may stand: And the Intent of the Testator
was, That his Son J. should have the Lands for 31 years, if he so long lived,
and if he died within the Term, That G. his Son should have such Term. And he
held, That the same was in J. an Estate by Limitation, and he could not sell
it, nor could it be extinct by Act in Law, or of the Law. It was a Lease
determinable by his death, and so shall be the Lease of G. determinable upon
his own death; and G. upon the death of J. within the Term, shall have the
residue of the number of the years limited by the former Devise; scil. so many
in number as were not expired in the life of J. who was first Executor to that
special purpose. Gent, Baron, to the same intent; here he has the same Term as
Executor; and it is not like a-Term devised, which the party has as Legatee;
but in our Case, he has only authority in this Lease as Executor, and the Land
was tied to the time and the Authority; and when the same determines in his
person, then the Land departs from him to G. who was a special Executor to that
purpose, as J. was before. And G. had not the same Term which J. had; but such
a Term. Clerk, Baron, acc. And he said, that the Will was further, that if G.
died before his Debts paid, and his Will performed; and the Jury finding all
the special matter, concluded, that if the Term limited to J. be extinct, then
they find for the Defendant. And he held clearly, that J. had this Term of 21
years as Executor, and that by the descent of the Inheritance to J. the Term as
to himself was gone: But as to Creditors and to the Legatees, it shall be said
in esse, and be Assets in his hands: And because that the Term as to that
purpose shall be said in esse, he died within the Term, within the intent of
the said Will. And this word, Term, is, Vox polysema, Terminus status, Terminus
temporis, Terminus loci. And in our Case, the word, Term, has reference to
time, and not to estate; for the Testator did respect the time in which his
Will might be performed, and that was 31 years; as if I make a Lease during the
Term that J. S. has in the Manor of D. and J. S. has 40 years in it; now
although that J S. surrendreth or forfeiteth it, yet he shall hold over, but he
shall have it for 40 years; for my Lease refers to the time, and not to the
estate. In the like manner here, G. cannot have the same Term which J. had, nor
for 31 years after the death of J. but so much of the said 31 years shall be
cut off in the interrest of it, as J. had enjoyed it; and G. shall have as many
years as J. has left; and G. shall perform so much of my Will as J. at his
death within the Term aforesaid shall not have performed: As if I Lease my Land
to one until he has levied 100 l. and if he dies before that he has levied
it, then J. S. shall have such Term for the levying of it: the first Lessee
levieth 50 l. and dies, J. S. may levy the residue, but not the whole. And
although that the Jury says, that if the Term be extinct, then they find for
the Defendant; although that it be extinct, yet they are not to take Conusance
what the Law is thereupon: but that is the Office of the Judges. As 13 E. 3.
the Jury found, that the Son was born during the Elopement, and so Bastard;
that Conclusion of the Verdict is not to the purpose, but the Court ought to
judge upon the premises of the Verdict, If upon the birth, during the
Elopement, the party be Bastard or not? And afterward, Manwood, with the
assent of his Companions the Barons, Commanded, That Judgment should be entered
for the Plaintiff; Which was done accordingly.

CLX. The Bishop of Bristow's Case. Trin. 26 Eliz. In the Exchequer.
NOte, It was holden by Manwood, Chief Baron, in this Case, That if a Lease be
made for years rendering Rent, 1 Cro. 398. More Rep. 891.
with Clause of Distress; And afterward, the Rent and Reversion are extended
upon a Statute, or seized into the Kings hands for Debt; if the Lessee pays
the Rent according to the Extent, the same is not in any danger of the
Condition, for that now the Lessee is compellable to pay it according to the
Extent.

CLXI. Hill. 26 Eliz. In the Exchequer.
THe Queen by her Letters Patents granted to J. S. catalla Utlagatorum, and
Felonum de se, within such a Precinct; More Rep. 126, 127.
One who was endebted unto the Queen, is felo de se, within the Precinct. It
was the Opinion of all the Barons, and so Ruled, That notwithstanding the Grant
by the said Letters Patents, That the Queen should have the Goods for to
satisfy her Debt.

CLXII. Tuker and Norton's Case. Pasch. 26 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
THe Case was; An Infant being in Execution upon a Condemnation in Debt,
brought a Writ of Error: His Father and his Brother was his Bail: It was the
Opinion of the Justices, That they two only should enter into the Recognizance,
That the Enfant shall appear; and that if the Judgment be affirmed, that they
shall pay the Money, and not that they shall render the Body of the Enfant again
to Prison: for that, when once he is discharged of the Execution, he shall
never be in Execution again.

CLXIII. Marsh and Jones's Case. Mich. 27 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
2 Len. 117.
IN a Replevin, the Case upon the Evidence was, That before the Statute of Quia
emptores terrarum, A Man made a Feoffment in Fee to hold of him by the
services, Solvend. post quamlibet vacationem sive alienationem, the value of
the annual profits of the Lands, etc. It was holden by the Court, That value
shall be intended, which at the time of the Feoffment was the value, and not as
it is now improved by success of time.

CLXIV. Annesley and Johnsons's Case. Mich. 27 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
IN an Ejectione Firm, upon Evidence, the Case was, That Roger Wake was
seized, etc. and before 27 H. 8. enfeoffed certain persons to his use, etc. and
they being so seized to the use aforesaid, The said Roger by his Will willed,
That his Feoffees and Executors should found a Chauntry in perpetuity, and a
Priest there, to say Mass pro anim', etc. and that they procure a License to
alien in Mortmain, and also an Incorporation for such Chauntry Priory; And that
the said Lands should be conveyed to such a Priest, etc. And also that every
such Priest should be Schoolmaster there; And that post dictam Cantariam sic
fundatam and stabilitam, the said Priest should say Mass, etc. Roger Wake died:
The Feoffees and Executors did not procure any Corporation, or License to alien
in Mortmain, nor make any estate to the Chauntry Priest: But the appointing a
Priest who said Mass according to the Will of the said Roger, and was also a
Schoolmaster, and took the profits of the said Lands as owner of them, and
died: After which, one Vere was appointed to be Schoolmaster there, but he was
merely a Lay-person, and so continued until his death, and took the profits of
the Land; And upon part of the Land he built a House, and there dwelt, and kept
a School. And after his death, one Curtis was appointed by the Executors to
teach there, and he was a Layman, and there taught many years; and afterward
he took Orders, and became a Priest, and said Mass, and other Divine Service,
and continued Schoolmaster also: And 26 H. 8. the same was presented for a
Chauntry for First Fruits, and first fruits were paid for it, as appeared by a
Particular which was showed in Evidence. And also, 2 E. 6. it was presented for
a Chauntry, and the possessions of it seized into the Kings hands. And it was
much insisted upon, That Vere being a mere Layman, that the same was a
forcible Interruption of the Reputation of the Chauntry. But it was the Opinion
of the whole Court to the contrary: And that notwithstanding, That no
Corporation was obtained, yet because that the Priest was appointed by color
of the Will, and he said Mass according to the Will, although Vere who
succeeded him was a mere Layman, and not a Priest; yet afterward when Curtis
came being appointed but a Schoolmaster, being also a mere Layman, yet
afterward when he took upon him Orders, and demeaned himself as a Chauntry
Priest there ratione institutionis by the Will of Wake, which is confirmed by
the Certificate, and also by the Presentment; The first Reputation is revived,
and the Law shall not construe, That Curtis took the profits in the Quality of
a Schoolmaster, but as a Priest; for the Law has respect to the Will of the
said Wake, which was the ground of all these proceedings, and that, although he
did not say Mass within 5 years before the Statute of 1 E. 6. And Note, That
the Certificate of 26 H. 8. was, That Rich. Curtis was Cantarista: And it has
always been adjudged, That a Chauntry by Reputation is within the Statute of 1
E. 6.

CLXV. Brian and Cawsen's Case. Trin. 27 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
IN Trespass by Brian and his Wife and others, against Cawsen; It was found by
Special Verdict, 2 Len. 68.
That W. Gardener was seized in Fee according to the Custom of the Manor of C.
of certain Lands, and surrendered them to the use of his last Will, by which he
Devised them in this manner; scil. I Bequeath to Jo. Th. my House and Lands in
M. called Lacks and Stone; To Ste. Th. my House and Lands called Stokes and
Newmans; And to Roger Th. my House and Lands called Lakins and Brox. Moreover,
If the said Jo. Ste. or Roger, live till they be of lawful age, and have Issue
of their bodies lawfully begotten, Then I give the said Houses and Lands to
them and their heirs in manner aforesaid, to give and sell at their pleasure.
But if it fortune one of them to die without Issue of his body lawfully
begotten, Then I will, that the other Brothers or Brother have all the said
Houses and Lands in manner aforesaid; And if it fortune the Three to die
without Issue in like manner; Then I Will, That all the said Houses and Lands
be sold by my Executor or his Assignee, and the Money to be given to the Poor.
The Devisor dies, Jo. Ste. and Roger are admitted according to the intent of
the Will; Roger dies within age without Issue; John and Ste. are admitted to
his part; John comes of full age, and has Issue J. and surrenders his part of
the whole, and his estate therein, to the use of Ste. and his Heirs; who is
admitted accordingly. Ste. comes of full age, John the Father dies; Ste. dies
without Issue; J. the Son as Cosen and Heir of Ste. is admitted according to
the Will, and afterward dies without Issue; The Wives of the Plaintiffs are
Heirs to him, and are admitted to the Lands called Lacks and Stone, and to the
moiety of the Lands called Lakins and Brox, parcel of the place where, etc.
praetextu quorum, they enter into all the Lands where the Trespass is done. And
it was found, that A. the Executor died Intestate; And that Cawsen the
Defendant is Cosen and Heir to the said Devisor, and that he as Heir entered and
did the Trespass.

First, It was agreed by all, That by the first words of the Will, the 3.
Devisees had but an Estate for life: But Fenner and Walmesley who argued for
the Plaintiffs, Conceived, That by force of the later words, scil. If the said
John, Stephen, and Roger, live till they be of lawful age, and have Issue of
their body lawfully begotten, Then I give the said Lands and Houses to them and
their Heirs in manner aforesaid, etc. They have Fee; and the words, In manner
aforesaid, are to be referred not unto the Estate which was given by the first
words which was but for life, but to make them hold in severalty as the first
Devisor willed, and not jointly, as the words of the second Devise purported.
And Fenner said, It has been Resolved by good Opinions, That where a Fine was
levied unto the use of the Conusor and his Wife, and of the Heirs of the body
of the Conusor, with diverse Remainders over; Proviso, That it shall be lawful
to the Survivor of them to make Leases of the said Lands in such manner as
Tenant in tail might do by the Statute of 32 H. 8. although those Lands were
never Demised before the Fine, yet the Survivor might demise them by force of
the Proviso, notwithstanding the words, In manner, etc. So if Lands be given to
A. for life upon Condition, the Remainder to B. in manner aforesaid; these
words, In manner aforesaid, refer unto the Estate for life limited unto A. and
not unto the Condition, nor unto any other Collateral manner.

The words, If they live until they be of full age, and have Issue, are words
of Condition, and shall not be construed to such purpose, to give to them by
Implication an estate tail: For the words subsequent are, That they shall have
them to them and their Heirs, to give and sell at their pleasure. By which it
appears, That his intent was not to make an estate tail; For Tenant in tail
cannot alien or dispose of his estate, etc. And as unto the last words, And if
it fortune they three to die without Issue, etc. these words cannot make an
estate tail, and the express Limitation of the Fee in the first part of the
Will, shall not be controverted by Implication out of the words subsequent. As
if Lessee for 40 years Devises his Lands to his Wife for 20 years, and if she
dies, the remnant of the Term unto another; although, that she survive the 20
years, she shall not hold over: and here the second sale appointed to be made
by the Executor, shall not take away the power of the first sale allowed to the
Devisee's after-Issue. Snagg and Shuttleworth, Sergeants, to the contrary; And
they Conceived, That the Defendant has right to two parts; for no express
Inheritance vests in the Devisees until full age and issue; and because two of
the Devisees died without Issue, they never had any Inheritance in their two
parts, and so those two parts descended to the Defendant as Heir to the
Devisor, no sale being made by the Executor. These words, If John, Stephen, and
Roger, are to be taken distributive; viz. If John live, etc. are to be taken
distributive; If John live until, etc. he shall have the Inheritance in his
part; and so of the rest. As if J. have right unto Land which A. B. and C. hold
in Common, and J. by a Deed release to them all, the same shall enure to them
severally, 19 H. 6. And here, these later words, If these three do die without
Issue, by that they conceived, The same to be but an estate in tail. And see to
that purpose, 35 Ass. 11. 37 Ass. 15. For a Man cannot declare his intent at
once, but in several parts; all which make but one sentence. And so it is said
by Persay, 37 Ass. 15. We ought to have regard upon the whole Deed, and not
upon parcel. And see Clark's Case, 11 Eliz. Dyer, 330, 331. And it was said, If
I give Lands to one and his Heirs so long as he has Heirs of his body, it is a
Feesimple determinable, and not an estate in tail. Quaere of that. Then here
the Feesimple is determined by the death of the Devisees without issue, and
therefore the Land ought to revert to the Heir of the Devisor, especially being
no person in rerum natura, who can sell, for the Executor before sale by him
made, died Intestate; and if he had made an Executor, yet the Executor of the
Executor could not sell. Which see, 19 H. 8, 9 and 10. And afterward Resolved,
That no estate tail is created by this Will, but the Feesimple settled in them,
when they came at their lawful age, and had Issue; so as the residue of the
Devise was void, and Judgment was given accordingly.

CLXVI. Griffith and Agard's Case. Mich. 27 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
IN Disceit by Griffith against Agard and his Wife; 1 Len. 290.
For that a Fine was levied of a Message, being Ancient Demesne, by which it
became Frank-Fee; and the Fine was levied in the life of A. Griffith,
Grandfather of the Plaintiff: Exception was taken to the Writ, because it is
brought by the Plaintiff as Cosen and Heir of A. G. his Grandfather; And in the
beginning of the Writ, the words are, Si Henricus Griffith fecerit te securum;
without saying, Cosen and heir of A. G. fecerit te securum. But the Exception
was not allowed; For afterward in the Writ, these words are, Cujus haeres ipse
est. See the Register, 238. that it is sufficient, if there be in the body of
the Writ, these words, Cujus haeres ipse est.

Another Exception was taken to the Declaration, in that it is alleged, that
the Lands were, De antiquo Dominico Dominae Reginae Angliae; wereas it ought to
have been, De antiquo Dominico Dominae Coronae suae, etc. The Opinion of the
Court was, That it was good both ways. See Book Entries, 100. antiquo Dominco
Coronae, and 58. de antiquo Dominico Domini Regis.

CLXVII. Bashpool's Case. Mich. 27 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
2 Len. 101. Styles Rep. 148.
THe Case was, The Father was seized of Lands in Fee, and bound himself in an
Obligation; and devised his Lands unto his Wife, until his Son should come to
the age of 21 years, the Remainder to his Son in Fee, and died, and no other
Land descended or came to the Son from the Father. It was moved by Godfrey,
That the Heir in this case might elect to waive the Devise, and to take the
Land by Descent. See 9 E. 4. 18. by Needham. But it was the Opinion of Gaudy
and Shute, Justices, That the Son should be adjudged in by Descent; and so
bounden with the Debt.

CLXVIII. Branthwait's Case. Mich. 27 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
DEbt brought by J. D. against Branthwait upon an obligation; the Condition of
which was, That whereas J. F. claimed to have a Lease for years of the Manor
of D. made and granted to him by one W. D. If the said Branthwait keep without
damage the Plaintiff, from all claim and Interest to be challenged by the said
J. F. de tempore in tempus during the years, etc. and also deliver the said
Lease to the Plantiff, that then, etc. The Defendant pleaded, That the said J.
F. had not any such Lease, and that after the making of the said Obligation,
until the Action brought, the Plaintiff was not damnified ratione dimissionis
praedictae. Exception was taken to the same, because, where the words of the
Condition are, Keep without damage the Plaintiff from all Claim and Interest:
And he has pleaded, That the Plaintiff was not damnified ratione dimissionis,
etc. But the Exception was disallowed by the Court; For if he were not
damnified ratione dimissionis, then he was not damnified by reason of any Claim
or Interest. Another Exception was taken, Because he could not now say, there
was no such Lease: For it is recited in the Obligation, That J. F. claimed to
have a Lease: and therefore by this recital he is estopped, etc. And see where
a Recital is an Estoppel, 8 R. 2. Fitz. 2 Len. 11.
tit. Estoppel, 283. 39 E. 3. 3. Fitz. Estoppel, 112. 46 E. 3. 12. It was
holden by the Court, That it was a good Estoppel. And afterward, Judgment was
given for the Plaintiff.

CLXIX. Mich. 27 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
DEbt upon an Obligation; The words of the Obligation were; I am content to
give to W. 10 l. at Michaelmas; and 10 l. at our Lady day. It was holden by the
Court, That it was a good Obligation: And it did amount to as much as, I
promise to pay, etc. It was also holden by the Court, That an Action of
Covenant lay upon it, as well as an Action of Debt, at the Election of the
Plantiff. And it was holden, That although the Action is for 40 l. and the
Declaration is 20 l. and 20 l. at two several days; yet it is good enough, and
the Declaration is well pursuant to it: And afterward, Judgment was given for
the Plaintiff.

CLXX. The Queen and Kettell's Case. Trin. 27 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
THe Queen brought a Writ de Valor Maritagii against Kettell, and Counted of a
Tenure in Chief. The Defendant pleaded, That, pendant the Writ, the Queen had
granted to one Edmund Kettel, Custodiam and Maritagium of the said Defendant,
with whom he had Compounded. It was holden by the whole Court, to be no Plea;
for the Letters Patents were void, because the Queen was deceived in her Grant:
for it appears by the Count, that the Defendant before the Grant of the
Queen, was of full age; And by the Letters Patents, the Queen intended that he
was within age; and, by the same, granted Custodiam, etc.

CLXXI. Mich. 27 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
A. Seized of Land, by his Will Devised, 1 Len. 31.
That his Executors should sell the Lands, and died; the Executors levied a
Fine thereof to one F. taking Money for it of F. The Question was, If in title
made by the Conusee to the said Lands by the Fine, It be a good Plea against
the same to say, Quod parts Finis nihil habuerunt? Anderson conceived, That it
was. But by Windham and Periam, upon Not guilty, the Conusee may help himself,
by giving in Evidence the special matter; in which Case the Conusee shall be
adjudged in, not by the Fine, but by the Devise. And Windham said, That if A.
Devise, That his Executors shall sell a Reversion of certain Lands of which he
dies seized, and they sell the same without Deed, the same is well enough; for
the Vendee is in by the Devise, 1 Just. 113. a.
and not by the Conveyance of the Executors; Quod vide 17 H. 6. 23. And by
Periam, The Conusee may help himself in pleading; As he who is in by the
Feoffment or Grant of Cestuy que use, by the Statute of 1 R. 3.

CLXXII. Lee and Loveday's Case Trin. 27 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
TEnant in tail leased for 60 years, and afterward levied a Fine to Lee and
Loveday, sur Conusans de Droit come ceo, etc. and their Heirs in Fee: And
afterward, the Lord of the Manor of whom the Land was holden, brought a Writ
of Disceit, and upon that, a Scire facias against the Conusees, supposing the
Land to be Ancient Demesne. The Defendants made default, by which the Fine was
annulled, and now the Issue in tail entered upon the Lessee for years; and he
brought an Ejectione firm. And it was found, that the Land was Frank-Fee. And
the sole Question was, If by the Reversal of the Fine by the Writ of Disceit,
without suing a Scire facias against the Ter-Tenant, should bind him? Atkinson,
It shall not bind the Lessee for years; For a Fine may bind in part; and in
part, not: as, bind one of the Conusees, and not the other. As. 7 H. 4. 11. a
Fine levied of Lands part Ancient Demesne, and part at the Common Law, and by a
Writ of Disceit, the Fine was reversed in part; scil. as to the Land in Ancient
Demesne; and stood in force for the Residue. See 8 H. 4. 136. And there by the
Award of the Court, issued a Scire facias against the Ter-Tenant; And the
Justices would not admit of the Fine without Certificate that the Land is
Ancient Demesne, notwithstanding that the Defendant had confessed it. But as to
those which were parties to the Fine, the Fine was become void between the
parties; and he who had the Land before, might enter. See 8 E. 4. 6. And it
would be a great inconvenience, if no Scire facias, or other Process, should be
awarded against the Ter-Tenant; For he should be dispossessed and dis-enherited
without privity or notice of it. Whereas upon a Scire facias he might plead
matter of discharge, in bar of the Writ of Disceit, Release, etc. which see,
Fitzh. Na. Br. 98. and so, although that the Fine be reversed; yet he may
retain the Land. And he resembled the same to the Case of 2 H. 4. 16, 17. In a
Contra formam Collationis against an Abbot; A Scire facias shall issue forth
against the Feoffee: and by the same reason, here in this Case. And for the
principal matter, he conceived, That the Fine should be awarded between the
parties, but not against the Lessee. Kingsmill conceived, That a Scire facias
brought against the parties only, was good enough; For they were parties to the
Disceit, and not the Ter-Tenants, etc. it was Ad^^rned.

CLXXIII. Trin. 27 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
ERror was brought upon a Judgment in a Quid juris clamat: It was assigned for
Error, That the Tenant appeared by Attorney; which Act he ought not to do in his
own proper person, if it be not in case of necessity; where in such case an
Attorney may be received by the King's Writ, and plead matter in bar of the
Attornment. As if he claim Fee, etc. or other peremptory matter, after which
Plea pleaded, he may make an Attorney, 48 E. 3. 24. 7 H. 4. 69. 21 E. 3. 48. 1
H. 7. 27.

Another Error was assigned, Because it is not showed in the Quid juris clamat,
what estate the Tenant has. Another matter was, If the Grantee of the estate
of Tenant in tail after possibility of Issue extinct, should be driven to
Attorn? And conceived, He should not, Because the privilege passes with the
Grant. See 43 E. 3. 1. Tenant in tail after possibility of Issue extinct, Post.
241.
shall not be driven to Attorn, 46 E. 3. 13. 27. therefore neither his Grantee.
Williams, contrary, As to the appearance of the Tenant by Attorney, because the
same is admitted by the Court, and the Plaintiff, the same is not Error. Which
see, 1 H. 7. 27. by Brian and Conisby, 32 H. 6. 22. acc. And he conceived, That
the Grantee should be driven to Attorn; For no other person can have the estate
of the Tenant in tail after possibility of Issue extinct, but the party
himself, therefore not the privilege: And although he himself be dispunishable
of Waste; yet his Grantee shall not have such privilege; As if Tenant in
Dower, or by the Courtesy, grant over their estates, the Heirs shall have an
Action of Waste against the Grantees for Waste done by the Grantees. But if the
Heir grants over the Reversion, then Waste shall be brought against the
Grantees. See Fitzh. Na. Br. 57. And if two Coparceners be, and one takes
Husband, and dies, the Husband being Tenant by the Courtesy, A Writ of
Partitione facienda lies against him; but if he grants over his estate, no
Writ of Partition lies against the Grantee. 27 H. 6. Statham, Aid; Tenant in
tail after possibility, etc. shall not have Aid, but his Grantee shall. Clark
conceived, That the Grantee should not be driven to Attorn: If the Tenant in
tail grant all his estate, the Grantee is dispunishable of Waste: So if the
Grantee grant it over, his Grantee is also dispunishable. It was Adjourned.

CLXXIV. Trin. 27 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
Hob. Rep. 66.
IN Action of Trespass against J.D. for breaking of his Close, etc. The
Defendant pleaded, That the Trespass whereof, etc. was done by the Defendant,
and one J.S. against which J.S. the Plaintiff at another time had brought an
Action of Trespass, and Recovered, etc. and had Execution of the Damages, etc.
Plowden said, It was a good Bar, for that all is but one Trespass; and
satisfaction by one of the Trespassors, is satisfaction for the other: And if
the Plaintiff had Released to the other Trespassors, the Defendant if he had it
in his hand might well plead it. Wray conceived it a good Bar; For it is but
one Trespass and one wrong, although in respect of the several persons of the
Trespassors, there are several Corporeal Acts. Atkinson conceived, That the Bar
was not good; and it is not like the Case of Release, for that takes away the
whole Trespass whosoever does it: And this Action may be sued jointly or
severally against the Trespassors: and when the joint suit is Released, the
several suit is Released. Clench, If an Action of Trespass be brought against
two, and they plead several Pleas, and afterward one of them is found guilty
by a several Jury, That Jury shall assess all the Damages; and if the other be
afterward found guilty, he shall be subject to the said Damages, although he
was not party to the said Jury: and by the same Reason that he shall be charged
with the same Damages, by the same Reason he shall have advantage of the
satisfaction of them made by his Companion. See Br. Trespass, 2.

CLXXV. Hitchcock and Thurland's Case. Trin. 27 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
IN an Action upon the Statute brought for taking of Lands to Farm by a
Spiritual person, 21 H. 8. It was holden, That if any such Lease be made at
this day to any Spiritual person, such a Lease is not void: But such a Lease
extends to such Leases made before the Feast of St. Michael mentioned in the
said Act, and not aliened before the said Feast, etc. And so it was said, It
was lately adjudged in one Underwood's Case.

CLXXVI. Cutter and Dixwell's Case. Trin. 27 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
AN Action upon the Case brought by Cutter against Dixwell: for that the said
Defendant had exhibited a Bill to the Justices of Peace against the Plaintiff,
containing, That the Plaintiff is an Enemy to all Quietness, seeking all means
to disquiet his Neighbors, and has used himself as a Lawless person; and
having Process to serve upon one in the Parish; viz. the Parson, did keep the
Process, and would not serve it but on the Sabbath day in the time of Divine
Service, not having regard to her Majesty's Laws, or the Quiet of his
Neighbors. Upon which Bill, the Justices to whom it was exhibited, awarded
Process against the Plaintiff, to find Sureties for his good behavior. It was
the Opinion of the Justices, That upon this matter, an Action would not lie.

CLXXVII. Mason's Case. Trin. 26 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
MAson Leased certain Lands to one R. for years; and afterward leased the same
Lands to one Tinter for years; Tinter Covenanted with the Defendant, That if
the said R. should sue the said Mason by reason of the later Lease, that then
he would discharge or keep harmless without damage the said Mason, and also
would pay to him all the Charges which he should sustain by reason of any suit
to be brought against the said R. in respect of the said former Lease: And
Mason by the same Indenture Covenanted with Tinter, That the said Land demised,
should continue to the said Tinter discharged of former Charges, Bargains, and
Encumbrances: And now upon the second Covenant, Tinter brought an Action of
Covenant, and showed, That the said R. had sued him in an Action of Ejectione
Firm upon the said first Lease, and had recovered against him, etc. And Mason
pleaded in Bar, the said second Covenant, intending that by that later
Covenant, the Plaintiff had notice of the said former Lease made unto R. so as
the first Lease shall be excepted out of the Covenants of former Grants; for
otherwise, there should be circuity of Action. But the Opinion of the whole
Court was to the contrary: For the Covenant of Mason shall go to the discharge
of the Land; but the Covenant of Tinter only to the possession.

CLXXVIII. Knight and Beeches Case. Pasch. 27 Eliz. Rott. 1127. In the Common
Pleas.
1 And. 173. Coke 5. Rep. 55. 1 Len. 12. 2 Len. 134.
WIlliam Knight brought Ejectione Firm against William Beech. The Case was,
That the Prior of St. John's of Jerusalem, 29. H. 8. with the assent of his
Covent, leased by Indenture diverse Houses in Clarken-well, in the County of
Middlesex, for fifty years, to one Cordel, rendering Rent 5 l. 10 s. and 11 d.
at four Feasts of the year, usual in the City of London, viz. for such a
Message, called The High-House, 14 s. for another House, 3 s. 11 d. for
another House, xx s. etc. Et si contingat dictum annualem redditum, 5 l. 10 s.
11 d. a retro fore, in part vel in toto, ultra aut post aliquem terminum
solutionis, in quo solvi deberet, per spatium trium mensium, etc. quod tunc,
and ad omnia tempora deinceps, ad libitum, etc. liceret dicto Priori, and
Successoribus suis, and omni tali personae and personis, quam vel quas dictus
Prior and Successores sui nominarent and appunctuarent, sine scripto, in omnia
dicta tenementa totaliter re-entrare, etc. And afterward, 32 H. 8. the said
Hospital of St. John's was dissolved, and the possessions of it granted to the
said King; and afterward the said King, 36 H. 8. gave the said House, upon
which the said Rent of 20 s. was reserved, to one Audley, etc. in Fee: And
afterward the now Queen being seized of the residue, a Commission issued out
of the Exchequer bearing Date 8 Maii, 23 Eliz. Ad inquirendum, Utrum the
Defendant to whom the Interest of the said term did appertain, perimple visset
and performasset omnes Provisiones fact. and reservat. in and super praedict.
Indenturam, necne? Office was found before the Grant, and after 25 August
following, the said Queen, by her Letters Patents, gave the said House, called
The High-House, to Fortescue the Lessor of the Plaintiff; and afterward Tres
Mich. the Commission was returned, by which it was found all as aforesaid; Et
quod Termini and Festi Solutionis in London, are Michaelmas, Christmas,
Annunciation, and Mid-summer; and that at the Feast of Michaelmas, such Rent
was behind for the space of three Months, etc. It was argued in this Case by
Gaudy, Sergeant, on the part of the Plaintiff, That here are several Rents; for
the entire Sum by the viz. is distributed into several Portions, which make
several Rents; and to that purpose he cited Winter's Case, 14 Eliz. Dyer, 308.
A Lease for years is made of the Manors of A.B. and C. rendering for the Manor
of A. xx s. and for the Manor of B. x s. and for the Manor of D. x s. with a
Condition for the Non-payment of the said Rents, or any of them, or any part or
parcel of them, within one Month, etc. then a Re-entry; Here are several Rents:
And he conceived, That a Condition in the Case of the King might be
apportioned; For a Rentcharge, and a Condition, are in the King in better
Condition than in a Subject, for the thing may distrain for a Rentcharge in
all the Lands, of him who is seized of the Land out of which such a Rent is
issuing; and if a Rent-seck be due to the King, he may distrain for the same;
and the King shall never demand his Rent which he has reserved with Clause of
Re-entry; and it appears in the Register, That if before the Statute of
Westminster. 3. the King purchases parcel of the Land holden of him, the Rent shall
be apportioned, which was not in the Case of a Common person, and there are in
the Exchequer diverse Presidents to that effect, scil. If A. be bounden in a
Recognizance to B. and afterward enfeoffeth the King of part of his Land, and
C. of the other part: If B. be afterward attainted of Treason, so as the said
Recognizance accrueth to the King; that now, notwithstanding that he has part
of the Land liable to the Recognizance, he shall have Execution of the residue.
And see F. N. B. 266. If, after the Recognizance acknowledged, the Conusor
enfeoffeth of certain parcels of his Lands several persons, and of the Residue
enfeoffeth the King; that Land which is assured to the King is discharged of
the Execution, but the residue shall be charged: So that the possession of the
King does alter the Nature of the Rent, Condition, and Execution. Fenner,
Serjant, Contrary. And he said, That this Grant before Office returned was not
good; for without Office the King cannot enter, multo minus his Patentee; and
that the King by the Grant has interrupted the Relation of the Office, As if a
Man by Indenture bargaineth and sells his Lands, and afterward makes Livery
to the Bargainee, and afterward the Deed is enrolled. Now the party shall not
be said to be in by the Bargain and Sale, but by the Livery; for the Livery
has interrupted the force of the first assurance by way of Bargain, and the
Relation is utterly gone: So in our Case, The Grant of the Queen, mean between
the Award of the Commission, and the Retorn of it, has destroyed the force and
effect of the Commission, so as no appearance shall be had of it: And he
agreed, That here are several Rents, but the Condition is entire; and admit,
that a Condition may be apportioned in some Cases, yet in some Cases it cannot.
And the Statute of 32 H. 8. gives the Condition and the Reversion, to which it
is annexed, to the King, in such sort as it was in the Prior: But the Condition
in the Prior was not capable of Apportionment, and therefore no more it shall
be in the Case of the King. As where a Recognizance is acknowledged, which
comes to the King by the Attainder of the Conusee; Now, if the King will sue
Execution upon it, he shall not have the whole Land of the Conusor in
Execution, but only the moiety by Elegit, etc.

This Case afterward, Trin. 28 Eliz. for Difficulty, was adjourned into the
Exchequer-Chamber, and there argued before all the Justices, and Barons of the
Exchequer. And Shuttleworth, Serjant, argued for the Plaintiff; And first he
said, Here are several Rents, and so several Conditions, especially when all
the things demised are of such a Nature, that they may yield a Distress: but if
any of the things demised cannot yield Distress, then it shall be one entire
Rent, and shall issue out of the Residue, etc. Which see, 17 Ass. 10. An Assise
was brought of 20 s. Rent, and the said Rent was reserved upon a Lease for life
made of 100 Acres of Lands, and 15 Acres of Wood; scil. for the Land 10 s. and
for the Woods 10 s. And by the Assise it was found the Disseisin in the Wood,
but not in the Land. Wherefore it was awarded, That the Plaintiff should
recover seisin of the 10 s. and for the residue, that he should take nothing.
And although these words (reddendo inde) Trench unto all the things demised
entirely, yet this word (viz.) is a distributive, and makes an Apportionment;
And the viz. is not contrary to the premises; scil. to the reddendo inde. As
if I enfeoffe A. and B. of an Acre of Land, Habendum the one moiety thereof to
A. in Fee, and the other moiety to B. in Fee; this is good, for it well stands
with the premises. But if I enfeoffe A. and B. of two Acres of Lands, Habendum
the one Acre to A. and the other to B. the same Habendum is void, because
contrary to the premises, for each of them is excluded out of one Acre which
was given to him in the premises. And in our Case, If the Rent set forth in
the (Viz.) had been greater or less than that which is reserved upon the
Reddendo, then the (Viz.) should be void for the contrariety, and the Reddendo
stand. Walmesley, contrary; And that here is one entire Rent. Which see to be
so, by the close of the Condition, Si Redditus praedict' aut aliqua inde
parcella, etc. And the Lessor may distrain in any part of the Land demised for
the whole Rent, notwithstanding the (Viz.) And it was moved by Shuttleworth,
That admit the Rent and Condition be entire; Yet now when the King grants the
Reversion of one of the things demised in Fee to a stranger, the Condition
remains, and not determined by the destruction of the Reversion, as in the case
of a Subject: For the King has diverse Prerogatives, by which he is exempted
and protected from such Mischiefs and Inconveniences which happen to Subjects
by their own Acts and their Laches and Folly, which shall not be imputed to the
King; And the reason of Extinguishment of a Condition in such case in the case
of a Common person, is his own Folly, that he will distrahere his Reversion;
And Folly shall never be imputed to the King: And as the Case is here, the King
is not bound to take notice of a Condition made by a Common ^erson; For it is
not matter of Record, and by this Grant of the King, the Rent does not pass;
for the Grant is only of the Reversion, without any mention of the Rent. And
the King has diverse Prerogatives in a Condition; As in the creating of a
Condition, 35 H. 6. 38. The Abbot of Sion's Case, Ad effectum, is a good
Condition in the Case of the King, by Prison: And where the King grants Lands
in Fee to one upon Condition, That the Grantee shall not alien, the same is a
good condition. So for a Rent-Seck, the King may distrain; And the King may
reserve a Rent and a Condition to a stranger; and if he does reserve a Rent and
a Condition to himself, he may grant the same over to a Subject, 2 H. 7. 8. And
the Condition in the case of a Common person may be apportioned: As if Lessee
of two Acres upon Condition, alien one of them in Fee, and the Lessor enters
for the forfeiture, or recovereth part in an Action of Waste, etc. but of a
surrender, it is otherwise. Walmesley contrary; The Condition is gone; For a
Condition in the hands of the King is of the same Nature, as in the case of a
common person, impatient of any Division, Partition, or Apportionment: As, if
the King has a Rent out of 3 Acres of Land, and afterward purchases one of
them, the Rent is utterly gone, and shall not be apportioned as well as in the
Case of a common person: So of a Common. And as this Case is, If the Condition
does remain, then, upon the breach of it, the King shall enter into the whole;
for the words of the Condition are, Wholly to re-enter; and so he should defeat
his own grant. And he cited a Case adjudged at the Assizes at York; The King
gave Land in Fee-Farm, rendering Rent, with Clause of re-entry: The King
grants the Rent over to a stranger; And after, the Rent is behind; The King
cannot re-enter, nor the Grantee.

It was also moved, If the Jurors of Middlesex might enquire of the usual Feast
days in London. Shuttleworth, That they might do so. See 5 H. 5. 23. Where a
Commission issued out to enquire in the County of Surrey, of Escheats, words,
etc. who found, that A. held of the King in Chief, and took to Wife one E.
Cosen of A. within the Degrees they then knowing of it, and had Issue betwixt
them; and afterward they were Divorced in the County of Kent, etc. And
Exception was taken to that Office, Because the Enquest of Surry had found a
Divorce in the County of Kent. Another matter was, Because the Jurors have
found the breach of the Condition; And before the Jurors had put their Hands
and Seals to the Inquisition, the Queen granted part of the things demised in
his hands, to Fortescue; After which Grant, the Inquisition was sealed, and
Returned into the Exchequer: If now, the Grant to Fortescue be good, or not?
Vide inde, Dyer, 2 Eliz. 17. Upon a Writ of Mandamus, The Escheator charged the
Enquest, who were agreed of their Verdict, and delivered the same in Paper to
the Escheator; And, before the engrossing, sealing, and delivery of it, came a
Supersedeas: And it was Resolved, by all the Justices, That before the
engrossing, indenting, and sealing, it was no Verdict. See this Case Reported
in Cook 5. Part, 54.

CLXXIX. Nelson's Case. Pasch. 27 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
IN Trespass brought by Nelson, chief Preignothory of the Court of Common
Pleas, the Case was, That the Abbot of D. was seized of a Common out of the
Lands of the Abbey of S. as appendant unto certain Lands of the said Abbey of D.
And afterward the said Houses were dissolved, and the possessions of them
given to the King by Act of Parliament, to have and hold in as large and ample
manner and form as the late Abbots, etc. After which, the King so being seized,
granted the said possessions of the said Abbey of D. to A. and the possessions
of the said Abbey of S. to B. It was argued, That the Common, (notwithstanding
the unity of possession) did continue; For unity of possession is so qualified
and restrained by the Statute, by the words aforesaid, and also by the words
(in the state and condition as they now be,) And the Abbot of D. was seized in
the right of his House, of the said Common; Therefore so also shall be the
King, and his Patentees; and so a special seisin is given to the King. Rhodes,
Windham, and Anderson, Justices, to the contrary. And the said words in the
said Statute are to be construed according to the Law, and no further; And by
the Law, the said Common cannot stand against the Unity of possession.

CLXXX. Leonard's Case. Trin. 28 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
2 Len. 192. 2 Roll. 787.
LEonard, Custos Brevium, brought an Action of Trespass for breaking of his
Close: The Defendant pleaded, That William Heydon was seized and enfeoffed him;
And upon Ne enfeffa pas, they were at Issue. And it was found by Special
Verdict, That the said William Heydon was seized, and leased to the Defendant
for years, and afterward made a Charter of Feoffment to him, by these words,
Dedi and Concessi, with a Warrant of Attorney in it, and delivered the same to
the said Lessee; who delivered the same to him who was made Attorney in the said
Deed, who made Livery accordingly. It was moved by the Plaintiff's Counsel,
That here is not any Feoffment found, but only a Confirmation; For as soon as
the Charter was delivered to the Lessee for years, the Law gave it its
operation to that effect, to vest the Fee in the Lessee by way of Confirmation.
See Litt. 532. But the Opinion of the whole Court was clear to the contrary;
for here the Lessee has liberty, how and by what Conveyance he shall be
adjudged seized of the Land, either by Feoffment, or by Confirmation: And it
appears here, That when the Lessee delivered the Charter to the Attorney; And
also when the Lessee accepted Livery from the Attorney, he declared his meaning
to be, That he would take by the Livery: And the Lord Anderson said, That if
Tenant in tail be disseised, and makes a Charter-Feoffment with a Warranty of
Attorney, and delivers the same to the Disseisor, who delivers the same to the
Attorney, who makes Livery accordingly, the same is a good Feoffment, and so a
Discontinuance. And after many Motions, the Court awarded, That the Plaintiff
should be barred.

CLXXXI. Palmer and Waddington's Case. Trin. 28 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
RIchard Palmer brought an Action upon the Case against Anthony Waddington; And
Declared, That Henry Waddington, Brother of the Defendant, was endebted to the
said Plaintiff in 20 l. Et jacens in extremis, and mortem indies expectans,
vocavit ad se dict. Anthonium quem executorem Testamenti and ultimae voluntatis
Constituisset, eum rogans ut dictas 20 Libras praefato Richardo infra spacium
duorum Mensium mortem suam proxime sequend. numeraret and solveret; Et dictus
Anthonius in Consideratione inde super se assumpsit, etc. And all the matter
aforesaid was found by Verdict, upon Non Assumpsit pleaded. And it was the
Opinion of the whole Court, That the Declaration was insufficient, because
there is not any good Consideration set forth in it; for it is not said, That
in Consideration that the said Henry made the Defendant his Executor. etc.

CLXXXII. Stransham and Collington's Case. Trin. 28 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
THe Plaintiff sued in the Spiritual Court for Tithes against the Defendant
within the Parish of C. The Defendant said, 1 Cro. 128.
That the Tithes are within the Parish of A. and the Parson of A. came in pro
interesse suo, and thereupon they proceeded to sentence, and that was given
against Stransham, who now sued a Prohibition: And the Question was, If within
such a Parish or such a Parish, be tryable by the Law of the Land, or by the
Law of the Church? Wray, Chief Justice, said, It has been taken, That it is
tryable by our Law. Fenner, The Pope has not distinguished Parishes, but has
Ordained, That Tithes shall be paid within the Parish.

CLXXXIII. Higham's Case. Mich. 28 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
2 Len. 226. More Rep. 221. 1 Cro. 15.
IT was found by Special Verdict, That Thomas Higham was seized of 100 Acres of
Lands called Jacks, usually occupied with a House; And that he Leased the said
House, and 40 Acres of the said 100 Acres to J.S. for life, and made his Will;
by which he devised the said House and all his Lands called Jacks, then in the
Occupation of J.S. to his Wife for life: and that after the decease of his
Wife, the Remainder thereof, and of all his other Lands appertaining to Jacks,
to Richard his second Son, etc. It was said by Meade, That the Wife should not
have by Implication the Residue of Jacks, for that she has an express estate
in the House, and 40 Acres of the Land; and her Husband having expressed his
Will as to that, his Will shall not be construed by Implication to pass other
Lands to the Wife. And it was said by him, That it had been adjudged in the
Case between Tracy and Glover, That if Lands be devised to one and to his
Heirs, and if he dies without Heir of his body, 1 Roll. 839.
that then the Land shall remain over; that in such case, the Donee has but an
Estate in tail to him and the Heirs males of his body.

And it was then also said by Anderson, Chief Justice, That in the time of Sir
Anthony Brown, it was holden, That if a Man be seized of two Acres of Land, and
devised one of them to his Wife for life, and that J.S. shall have the other
Acre after the death of his Wife; that the Wife has not any estate in the
later Acre, for the cause aforesaid: Afterward, It was moved, What thing
passed to the second Son by that Devise? And the Lord Anderson conceived, That
the words in the Will, Usually Occupied with it, did amount to as much, as Land
let with it; and then the 60 Acres were not let with it, and therefore did not
pass. Windham, Justice, held the contrary; and he said, Although they do not
pass by the words, Occupied with it; yet it shall pass to the Son by the name
of Jacks, or, the Lands appertaining to Jacks, To which Anderson, mutata
opinione, afterward agreed.

CLXXXIV. Wroth and the Countess of Sussex Case. Pasch. 28 Eliz. In the Kings
Bench.
Co. 6. Rep. 33. 1 Len. 35. 4 Len. 61.
THe Case was this, In Anno 4 and 5 of King Philip and Queen Mary; A private Act
of Parliament was made, by which it was Enacted, That the Manor of Burnham was
assured to the Countess of Sussex for her Ioynture; with a Proviso in the Act,
That it should be lawful for the Earl of Sussex to may a Lease or Leases for 21
years; and afterward, a year before the first Lease was ended, he made another
Lease for 21 years, and this second Lease was to begin and take effect from the
end of the first Lease. And if this second Lease were a good Lease within the
intent and meaning of the Act, was the Question?

Popham, the Queens Attorney General said, That it was not; 1. Because it was a
Lease to begin at a day to come: And, 2. Because it was made before the first
Lease was ended. But he said, It may be Objected, That the Act says (Lease or
Leases,) It is not the sense of the Act, that he might make Leases in the
Reversion: but the sense and meaning of the Makers of the Act, was, That he
might make Leases in possession, and not Leases in futuro; for if it should be
so, then he might make a Lease for 21 years to begin after his death: which
should be a great prejudice to the Countess, and against the meaning of the
Act, which was made for her advantage.

The Lord Treasurer, and Sir Walter Mildmay, Knight, have a Commission from the
Queen to make Leases of the Queens Lands for 21 years, because the Queen would
not be troubled. It was holden, That by virtue of that Commission, they could
not make any Leases, but Leases in possession only: But all other Leases which
did exceed the Term of 21 years, and in Reversion, were to pass by the hands of
the Queen, and her Attorney General, and not by them only by virtue of their
said Commission. And if I grant to one power before the Statute to make Leases
of my Land for 21 years, he cannot make any Lease, but only Leases in
possession; and he cannot Lease upon Lease, for by the same reason, that he
might make one Lease to begin in futuro; by the same reason he might make 20
several Leases to begin in futuro; and so frustrate the Intent of the Act. It
was Marshall's Case upon the Statute of 1 Eliz. of Leases to be made by
Bishops; The Bishop of Canturbury made a Lease to him for one and twenty years;
and afterward he made a Lease unto another for 21 years to begin at the end of
the first Lease. And it was holden, That the second Lease was void. But in the
great Case which was in the Exchequer-Chamber, upon this Point, There the
second Lease was in possession, and to begin presently, and to run on with the
other Lease; and therefore it was adjudged to be good, because the Land was
charged with more than 21 years in the whole. And if the Earl had done so here,
it had been a good Lease. Wray, Justice, said, That if the second Lease had
been made but two or three years before the expiration of the first Lease, that
then it had been utterly void; but being made but 2 or 3 days or months before
the expiration of the first Lease, he doubted, If it should be void, or not.
The Statute of 32 H. 8. makes Leases for 21 years, to be good from the day of
the date thereof: And a Lease was made to begin at a day to come: And yet it
was holden by two of the Justices in the Court of Common Pleas, That it was a
good Lease: And by two other Justices of the same Court, it was holden, the
Lease was not good. And Clench, Justice, said, That there was no difference, If
it be by one Deed, or by two Deeds: And therefore he held, That if the Earl had
made a Lease for 21 years, and within a year another, the same had been void,
if it were by one Deed, or two Deeds, for that he did exceed his authority. And
he said, In the principal Case, If there had not been a Proviso, he could not
have made a Lease; and therefore the Proviso which gave a power to make a Lease
for 21 years, should be taken strictly. There was a Case of the Lord Marquess
of, etc. that it should be lawful for him to make Leases for 21 years by a
Statute; And he made another Lease to begin after the end or expiration of the
first Lease; and it was doubted, Whether it were a good Lease or not, because
he had not made any Lease before: But if both were made by force of the
Statute; all held, That the second Lease was void.

At another day, the Case was argued by Daniel, for the Lease in Reversion to
begin at a day to come. And he said, That in a Statute the words alone are not
to be considered, but also the meaning of the parties, and they are not to be
severed. Also he said, That a Statute Law is to be expounded by the Common Law:
And by the Common Law, If one gives power unto another to make Leases of his
Lands, he might make Leases in Reversion, because an Authority is to be taken
most beneficially for them for whose cause it was given. So that if a Man grant
an authority to another to make Estates of his Lands, by those general words he
may make Leases for years or for life, Gifts in tail, Feoffments, or any
Estates whatsoever; If one gives a Commission to another to make Leases for one
and twenty years of his Lands, he may make a Lease in Reversion; and so it was
holden in the Duchy in the Case between Alcock and Hicks. Also he said, That
this Lease was a good Lease by the Statute Law: For the Statute of Rich. 3.
gives authority to Cestuy que Use, that he may make Estates in Reversion. The
Statute of 27 H. 8. which gives authority to the Chief Officer of the Court of
Surveyors to make Leases, if it had stayed there, he might have made Leases in
Reversion; Therefore the Statute goes further, and says, Proviso, That he
shall not make a Lease in Reversion. See 19 Eliz. Dyer, 357. The Statute of 35
H. 8. of Leases to be made by the Husbands of the Lands of their Wives, By the
general words of the Statute they might have made Leases in Reversion; And
therefore the Case there was, That where the Husband had made a Lease of his
Wives Lands for 21 years; and afterward he made another Lease for 21 years, to
begin after the Lease in esse: It was conceived, That such a Lease was good,
because in the Act there was no restraint of Leases in Reversion, as there is
in the Statute of 32 H. 8.

In all Cases of Statutes which are with Provisoes, the Law upon them shall be
taken generally, but in such Particulars only as are restrained by the Proviso;
and here in this Case, the Proviso went to the Ancient Rent to be reserved, and
that the Countess should have remedy for the said Rent; and therefore it shall
be construed at large as unto all other points which are not restrained by the
Proviso.

As if the Wife be within age, and she and her Husband join in a Lease, yet
such a Lease shall be good, by the Statute of 32 H. 8. because the Law is
general, and does not restrain these imperfections expressly. So if a Feoffment
in Fee be made with warranty, Proviso, That he shall not vouch; yet that
restraint goes to the Voucher only, and he is at large to Rebutt, or to have a
Warrantia Chartae. A Lease is made for life, Proviso, That he shall not do
voluntary Waste; he is at large to do any other Waste: Otherwise it would be,
if there were no Proviso,; and there a Proviso makes the precedent words to be
expounded more liberally. The Stat. of 33 H. 8. Cap. 39. of Surveyors, which
gives authority to the Chief Officer to set, or let for 21 years, he might
have made a Lease for 21 years, if by the Proviso he had not been restrained;
and yet the words are put singularly: But the words of this Act, upon which the
Case in Question does arise, are Lease or Leases; and therefore it shall be
expounded most liberally for the party.

Again, he argued, That as to the intent of the Statute, that this Lease was
within the meaning of it; for the meaning is to be collected out of the words,
and shall not be drawn to any private construction or intent against the words,
which should be here, if this Lease should be avoided: For by such construction
and exposition, the Earl, his Heirs, Executors, etc. should be prejudiced, and
the Countess only should be benefited. Also by this Act remedy is given to the
Countess against such Lessees, that she should have the Rent, by Debt, or
Distress; as if she had been party or privy: therefore it is reason, via versa,
that the Lessees have remedy against her for their Leases. Also he said, That
the same remedy should be for them against the Countess, as they had against
the Earl himself if he had been alive; and therefore they should have such
remedy against the Countess, as they had against the Earl. And further he said,
That the Statute is to be expounded according to the words where such an
Exposition is not rigorous, nor mischievous: And private Laws are to be
expounded by the letter, and strictly, as the Deed of the party shall be. As 14
E 4. 1. Br. Parliament, 61. A Particular Act was made, That the Chancellor
calling unto him one Justice, might award a Subpena between A. and B. and end
the matter betwixt them: And there, by all the Justices, except Littleton, He
shall not award a general Subpena, but a special Subpena, making mention of the
Act; for he shall pursue the particular Act strictly: But an Act which is for
the common profit, shall be expounded largely. Also a Statute shall not be
expounded largely, or by Equity to overthrow an Estate. As the Statute which
gives, That if the Woman does consent to the Ravisher, that the next Heir shall
enter: If the Daughter enters; and after a Son is born; he shall not put out
the Daughter, because the Statute shall not be drawn to a private intent, to
the overthrow of the Estate before lawfully vested in the Daughter: And so in
the principal Case, the Statute shall not be drawn to a private intent for the
benefit of the Countess, to overthrow the Lease for years. And it is not like
to the Case which has been put, That if he makes a Lease for 20 years, and so
for 20 years; that the same is not good by the Statute; For I will agree, That
that is a Lease for 40 years. Egerton, Solicitor, contrary; First, as to the
word ( Demise, or Dimission,) it is nothing else but the letting of the Land,
and so (Lease) comes from (Laiser) a French word; and such a Lease it self, for
he has not left the Land. As if I say to you, I Let you my Lands for 21 years;
When shall you have my Land? Not at a day to come, but presently. If I sell you
Land, and Covenant, that it is discharged of another Lease for 21 years, and
there is a Lease to Commence after the Lease for 21 years, I have broken my
Covenant. If I be bounden to make you a Lease for 21 years, and I say to you, I
make you a Lease to begin 200 years hence, I have forfeited my Bond. If the
Custom of the Manor be, that Dominus pro tempore may make a Lease for 21
years, may he make a Lease to begin at a day to come? Truly no, if there be not
a special Custom so to do. If I give authority to my Steward to make Leases of
my Lands for 21 years, he cannot make a Lease to begin 100 years after. As to
the Case of the Duchy, there the Commission was, That he might make Leases
according to his discretion, therefore there he might make what Lease he
pleases. As to the Statute which enableth Cestuy que Use, of 1 R. 3. that Case
is not like to our Case, for that Act is, All Feoffments, Estates, etc.
therefore he might make such Leases without doubt. And if I devise, That my
Executors shall make Leases of my Lands for 21 years, they cannot make Leases
to begin at a day to come; and if they do not make the Leases within convenient
time, the Heir shall enter, and avoid their authority.

And Statute Law shall have such an Exposition, as that the precise time ought
to be observed; As the Statute of 14 E. 3. Rastal Voucher, 8. If the Tenant
voucheth to warranty a dead Man, and the Demandants will aver, That the Vouchee
is dead, or that there is no such, their Averment shall be received without
more delay. Upon this Statute the Case was, 21 E. 3. Whereone was vouched to
warranty, and the Summoneas ad Warrantizandum issued, and then came the
Demandant and would have averred, That the Vouchee was dead; And the Tenant
said, That he ought to have averred that upon the voucher to warranty, and that
now he had surceased his time: And the Demandant said, That the Statute did not
bind him to that, nor did prescribe any time, but left the same generally. Yet
it was the Opinion of the whole Court, That he should have the Averment at the
time of the Voucher, or not at all. So the Statute of 11 H 7. Cap. 20. If a
Woman who has a Ioynture for life or in tail, suffers a Recovery, and
afterward the Issue in tail releaseth all his Right by Fine, and dies, his
Issue may enter; for the assent ought to be by Voucher in the same Action, or
the like: for if there be a mean instant between the Recovery and the Assent,
then any assent after is nothing to the purpose; for the Recovery being once
void by the Statute, cannot be made good by an assent afterward. See Doctor
and Student, 54. And yet the Statute is, Provided, That the Statute shall not
extend to any such Recovery, etc. if the next Heir be assenting to the same
Recovery, etc. so as the same assent, or agreement be of Record, or enrolled.
And it does not say, That the Assent should be at one time, or at another. But
to come to Leases upon Statutes. Before the Statute of 2 E. 6. Cap. 8. If
Leases had not been found by Offices, the Lessees should have been ousted, and
put to their traverse: But put Case, that after that Statute, a Lease made to
begin at a day to come, were not found by Office, should it be helped by that
Statute? No truly; And so it is holden in the Court of Wards at this day; and
the Lord Chief Justice of England held so in his Reading at Lincoln's Inn.

The Statute of 1 Eliz. of Leases to be made by Bishops, is, That Leases other
than for 21 years from the time that they begin; that is, when they may take
effect as Deeds, and not when they shall take effect to be executed; For so
they might make Leases infinite, etc. It was adjourned, etc.

CLXXXV. Lewen and Mody's Case. Mich. 28 and 29 Eliz. Rot. 2494. In the Common
Pleas.
IN a Replevin brought by Lewen, Doctor of the Civil Law, against Mody; who
made Conusans as Bailiff to one Fowke, and showed, That 14 Elizabeth, the
morrow of the Purification, a Fine was levied between Lovelace and Rutland
Plaintiffs, and the said Fowke and other Deforceants: by which Fine, the said
Deforceants acknowledged the said Manor to be the right of the said Lovelace
and Rutland, come ceo, etc. And the said Lovelace and Rutland, by the same
Fine, granted and rendered to the said Fowke a Rent of 20 l. per annum in Fee
out of the said Manor; And for the Rent arrear, etc. And the Plaintiff in bar
of the Conusans, showed, That the said Fowke being seized of the said Rent,
granted the same to one Horden, etc. Upon which Grant they were at Issue: And
the Jury found, That the said Fowke being seized of the said Rent, by Indenture
reciting, That whereas a Fine was levied between Fowke and 7 others Plaintiffs,
and Lovelace and Rutland Deforceants; as the rest ut supra, granted redditum
praedict. to Horden; and further found, that no other Fine was levied between
the parties aforesaid but the said Fine, and that the parties to the Fine were
seized of the Manor at the time of the Fine levied, and of no other Land: And
if this Rent so described by the said Indenture, should pass or not, was the
Question? And it is to be observed, That the Indenture of Grant between Fowke
and Horden, recited a Fine of the Manor of Coleshall inter alia, where the
Jury have found, That the Fine was levied of the said Manor only. And it was
argued by Shuttleworth, That the said Rent did not pass to Horden by the said
Indenture; for the Rent, bescribed by the Indenture, is not the Rent which was
granted by the Fine: And if I let Lands for years to A. and afterward A.
grants the Land which B. holds of me, the Grantis void; As 13 E. 3. Grants, 63.
Land is given to Husband and Wife for their lives; And the Lessor grants the
Reversion of the Land which the Husband holds for life, nothing passes.
Walmesley, contrary; The variance in the Fine shall not avoid the Grant; For
the Indenture of the Rent agrees with the Fine, in the Term, in the year of the
Reign, and in the name of the parties to the Fine, in the quantity of the Rent,
and in the Land charged; the only difference is in the phrase of Law,
Deforceant for Plaintiff; and it is granted, that that is but a matter of
Circumstance, and not of substance. Snag, Sergeant, contrary. And first he took
Exception to the Verdict; for this, that a special Verdict is given upon a
special Absque hoc. And the Lord Anderson interrupted him, That it was a clear
Case, That such a Verdict upon such an Issue might be found. And so it was
adjudged in the Case between Vavasour and Doleman. Fenner argued, as Walmesley,
The Grant agrees with the Fine in the points of greatest importance, and one
falsity shall not prejudice it where there are so many verities which may
induce the Court to judge, That the Rent granted by the Indenture, is the Rent
created by the Fine: and in a Fine, the substance is not, Who was Deforceant,
who was Plaintiff; but who was party to the Fine? And that some of the parties
to the Fine were seized of the Land of which the Fine is levied: And if the
Indenture had been, Whereas such a Rent was granted by a Fine levied between A.
and B. without showing who was Plaintiff, and who Deforceant, it had been good
enough. And although that in this Case, the Plaintiff and Deforceant are
mis-set down, yet the same shall not make the Grant void; for utile per inutile
non vitiatur. So if I reciting, The Original Grant was made to me by Indenture
Tripartite between A. of the first part; B. of the second part; and my self of
the third part; whereas the Indenture it self is, Between myself of the first
part, the same is not material, etc. For, such a small mistaking shall not
avoid the Grant. So if I by my Deed reciting, That whereas I am possessed of
certain Lands for Term of years of the Demise of Sir Christopher Hatton,
Knight, Treasurer of England; whereas in truth he is Chancellor; that mistaking
of the Dignity shall not prejudice the Grant. And it was Agreed by all the
Justices, If the said Fine had been pleaded at it is recited in the Indenture,
mistaking the Plaintiff and Deforceant; he who had so pleaded it, had failed of
his Record; But in the Case at Bar, the reciting who was Plaintiff, who
Defendant, was matter of surplusage, and therefore it shall not hurt the party.
As 23 Eliz. Dyer, 376. A. seized of a House in D. which he purchased of Tho.
Cotton, he made a Feoffment thereof by these words; A House in D. late Richard
Cotton's. And notwithstanding this variance, it was good enough; for the
variance is in a thing which is matter of surplusage: and so much the rather,
because the said A. had not another House in D. etc.

CLXXXVI. Lucas and Picroft's Case. Pasch. 28 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
THe Case was, That an Assise of Novel Disseisin was brought in the County of
Northampton, of two Acres of Lands; 2 Len. 41.
and as to one Acre, the Tenant pleaded a plea tryable in a Foreign County.
Upon which the Assise was adjourned into the Common Pleas, and from thence into
the foreign County; Where, by Nisi prius, It was found for the Plaintiff; and
now in the Common Pleas, Snag, Sergeant, prayed Judgment for the Plaintiff; and
cited the Book, 16 H. 7. 12. Where an Assise is adjourned into the Common Pleas
for difficulty of the Verdict, they there may give Judgment. But all the Court
held the contrary; For here is another Acre of which the Title is yet to be
tried before the Justices of Assise; before the trial of which, no Judgment
shall be given for the Acre of which the Title is found. And the Assise is
properly depending before the Justices of Assise, before whom the Plaintiff may
discontinue his Assise. And it is not like to the Cases of 6 E. 4. and 8 Ass.
15. Where in an Assise, a Release was pleaded, dated in a foreign County;
which was denied: Wherefore the Assise was adjourned into the Common Pleas, and
there found by Enquest, not the Deed of the Plaintiff's. Now if the Plaintiff
will release his Damages, he shall have Judgment of the Freehold presently. But
in our Case, parcel of the Land put in View, remains not tried; which the
Plaintiff cannot release, as he may his Damages, 2 Len. 199.
and therefore the Court remanded the Verdict, to the Justices of Assise.

CLXXXVII. Hare and Mellers Case. Mich. 28 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
Post. 163.
HUgh Hare of the Inner Temple brought an Action upon the Case against Phillip
Mellers, and declared, That the Defendant had exhibited unto the Queen a
slanderous Bill against the Plaintiff, charging the said Hugh to have recovered
against the Defendant 400 l. by Forgery, Perjury, and Cosening; And also, that
he had published the matter of the said Bill at Westminster. etc. In this Case, it
was said by the Court, That the exhibiting of the Bill to the Queen, is not in
it self any Cause of Action; For the Queen is the Head and Fountain of Justice,
and therefore it is lawful for all her Subjects to resort unto her ad faciendam
Querimoniam: But if a subject after the Bill once exhibited will divulge the
matter therein comprehended to the disgrace and discredit of the person
intended, the same is good cause of Action. And that was the Case of Sir John
Conway, who upon such matter recovered: And as to the words themselves, It was
the Opinion of the Court, That they are not actionable: For it is not expressly
showed, That the Plaintiff has used perjury, forgery, etc. And it may be, that
the Attorney, or Solicitor in the Cause, has used such indirect means not
known to the Plaintiff: And in such case it is true, That the Plaintiff has
recovered by forgery, etc. and yet without reproach: And by perjury he cannot
recover, for he cannot be sworn in his own Cause. It was adjudged against the
Plaintiff.

CLXXXVIII. Moore and the Bishop of Norwich's Case. Mich. 28 Eliz. In the
Common Pleas.
IN a Quare Impedit by Moor against the Bishop of Norwich, etc. It was found
for the Plaintiff; and thereupon issued forth a Writ to the Bishop, which was
not returned; Upon which an Alias issued forth: Upon which the Bishop returned,
That after Judgment given in the Quare Impedit, the same Incumbent against whom
the Action was brought, was Presented, Instituted, and Inducted into the same
Church, and so the Church is full, etc. And if that was a good retorn, It was
oftentimes debated. Windham cited the Case, L. 5 E. 4. 115, 116. A Quare
Impedit against Parson, Patron, and Ordinary, and, pendant the Writ, the Parson
resigned, and the Ordinary gave notice of it to the Patron; and afterward by
Lapse, the Ordinary presented the same Incumbent, who resigned: And afterward,
the Plaintiff in the Quare Impedit had Judgment to recovers, And it was holden,
Because the same Incumbent is now in by a new title; scil. by Lapse, and the
same person against whom the recovery was had; and that appeared to the Court,
he should be removed. See 9 Eliz. Dyer, 260. and 21 Eliz. Dyer, 364. And it was
said by the Lord Anderson, What person soever is presented and admitted after
the Action brought, unless it be that the title of the Patron be paramount the
title of the Plaintiff upon such Recovery he shall be removed: And so in the
principal case, It was adjudged, That the Retorn of the Bishop was not good.
Wherefore, he was fined 10 l. and a Sicut alias awarded upon pain of 100 l.

CLXXXIX. Parret and Doctor Matthews Case. Mich. 28 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
A Praemunire was brought and prosecuted by the Queens Attorney General and
Parret, 1 Len. 292.
against Doctor Matthews Dean of Christ-Church in Oxford, and others, for that
they procured the said Parret to be sued in the City of Oxford before the
Commissary there, in an Action of Trespass, by Libel according to the
Ecclesiastical Law; In which Suit, Parret pleaded his Freehold, and so to the
Jurisdiction of the Court; and yet they proceeded there, and Parret was
Condemned and Imprisoned: And afterward, the said Suit depending, the Queens
Attorney withdrew his Suit for the Queen.

It was now moved to the Court, If, notwithstanding that, the party Informer
might proceed in his suit there? See 7 E. 4. 2. the King shall have Praemunire;
and the party grieved, his Action, See Br. Praemunire, 13. for by Brook, None
can have Praemunire but the King.

Cook, There is a President in the Book of Entries, 427. In a Praemunire, the
words are, Ad respondendum tam Domino Regi quam R F. and that upon the Statute
of 16 R. 2. And see ibid. 429. tam Domino Regi de Contemptu praedict. quam
dicto A.B. de Damnis: But it was holden by the whole Court, That if the Queens
Attorney will not ulterius prosequi, the party grieved cannot maintain that
Suit; For the principal matter in the Praemunire is the Conviction; and the
putting of the party out of the Kings protection; and the damages are but
accessory; and then the Principal being Released, the damages are gone. And it
was also holden, That the Presidents in the Book of Entries, are not to be
regarded; For there is not any Judgment upon any of the pleadings there.

CXC. Archeboll and Borrell's Case. Mich. 28 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
ARcheboll brought an Action upon the Case against Borrell, and declared, That
the Defendant had procured one L. to bring an Appeal of the death of J.S.
against the now Plaintiff. To which Endictment the now Plaintiff peaded, Not
guilty; and upon that he was acquitted. The Defendant pleaded, That the now
Plaintiff was endicted of the said death in the County of S. scil. of the
stroke, and of the death of the dead in the same County. To which the Plaintiff
by Replication said, That the said J.S. was struck in the said County of S. but
died in the County of D. so as this Indictment found in the County of S. is
void by the Common Law: and by the Statute of 2 E. 6. the party ought to be
Indicted in the County where the party died, and not where the stroke was
given. And upon that Replication, the Defendant demurred in Law.

Broughton, The Plaintiff ought to be barred; 1. The Plaintiff was not lawfully
accquitted, for the proceedings are not by due process; For upon the Writ of
Appeal, no Pledges are returned. Which see, 11 H. 4. 160. Then, if the Appeal
was not duly sued, the Plaintiff was not duly acquitted; and then Conspiracy,
or Action upon the Case does not lie: For such suit does not lie, but where, if
the Plaintiff had been found guilty, he should have Judgment of life and
member: Which shall not be, upon an insufficient Appeal, 9 H. 5. 2. 2. Because
it is not showed in the Declaration, If the Defendant did fly, or not. 3. The
Declaration wants these words, Falso and Malitiose, as they are in the Writ of
Conspiracy. And also it is not showed, If the Plaintiff in the Appeal be
sufficient or not; For if he be sufficient, the Abettors shall not be enquired.
See Westminster. 2. And as to the Action it self, he conceived, That it does not lie
by Bill, but by Originial Writ against those who are found Abettors. See 2 E.
2. Fitz. Action upon the Statute, 28. such suit by Writ. But see 25 Eliz. It
was holden, Such suit does not lie by Writ. And see Book of Entries, 43, 44.

Flemming, to the contrary, It needs not to be showed, That the Plaintiff found
Pledges ad prosequendum, For without that, the Writ is good enough; and
although that the Writ be not well executed, yet it is good. For our Action is
not grounded upon the Record of Appeal, but at the Common Law, and the Record
is but Conveyance to our Action: And also there needs not in the Declaration,
falso and malitiose, for they are employed in the words, Abettavit, and
procuravit. And he conceived, That this Action is at the Common Law, and not
only upon the Statute of Westminster. 2. Which see, Stamford, 172. And see 3 E. 3.
Fitz. Conspiracy, 13. Conspiracy lies upon an Endictment of Trespass, as well
as upon an Endictment of Felony; for the Law has provided remedy in every Case
where a Man is damnified. As 43 E. 3. 20. A Writ of Disceit was brought, for
that the Defendant by Fraud and Collusion had procured J.S. to brign a Formedon
against the Plaintiff of such a Manor, by reason whereof the Plaintiff was put
to great charges, and holden maintainable: And the Statute of West. 2. is in
the affirmative, and therefore it does not abridge the Common Law, but the
subject may take the advantage of the Common Law if he pleases; For it may be
that the Course according to the Common Law will more avail him, than that upon
the Statute: For upon the Statute Law, If the Abettors have not any thing, the
party is without remedy; but by the Common Law, the party grieved, shall have
excution upon the body. 13 E. 2. Conspiracy holden maintainable against one who
procured one to sue an Appeal against the Plaintiff. See Fitz. Conspiracy, 25.
Fitzh. Na. Br. 98. If A. procures B. to sue an Action against me, to vex and
molest me, an Action of Disceit lies. And as to the matter of the Endictment,
I conceive, that it is not any bar; For the Endictment is merely void, because
it was found in the County where the stroke was, and not in the County where
the party stricken died, where of right it ought to be, and that by the Statute
of 2 E. 6. Then if the Endictment be insufficient, it is as no Endictment, and
then the Plea cannot excuse the Defendant. Which see, 20 E. 4. 6. If the
Endictment be not sufficient, the Appellee shall wage Battle, and the Abettors
shall be acquitted. Vide inde, 19 E. 3. Coron. 444. 26 H. 8. 2. And by the
Common Law, the Plaintiff might at his pleasure bring an Appeal where the
Plaintiff was stricken, or where he died: but in such case, the trial shall be
by both Counties. And 3 H. 7. 12. Appeal was brought in the County where the
party was stricken; And 44 H. 7. 18. the Appeal was brought in the County where
the party died; and there it is said, That in an Appeal the Plaintiff may
declare, as if the thing were done in both Counties, but the Endictment ought
to be in one County only. And 43 E. 3. 18. A Man stricken in one County, and
dies in another County, the Appeal shall be brought in the County where he
died. In an Action upon the Case brought in the County of Essex, the Plaintiff
Declared, That the Defendant held certain Lands, by reason of which he ought to
repair a Wall in the County of Essex juxta le Thames, and that the Plaintiff
had Land in the County of Middlesex adjoining to the said Wall; and for want of
repairing the said Wall, his Land in the County of Middlesex was drowned; and
the Writ was allowed, being brought in the County of Essex. See 6 H 7. 10.

Clench, I conceive this Action does not lie by the Common Law; For no Writ of
Conspiracy was at the Common Law before the Statute. And vide F. N. B. 114. F.
If the Plaintiff in an Appeal be Nonsuit, Conspiracy lies; but contrary, if he
be acquitted, for he shall have his remedy against the Abettors, etc.

Plowden, This Action lies at the Common Law, and an Endictment is no Plea in
this Action; and it is not grounded upon the Statute as a Conspiracy is, and so
it well lies, although the Abettors be not Enquired.

Gaudy, Sergeant, This is an Action by the Common Law; For in all cases where
one procures damages to another, so as the party is put to charges, an Action
lies, a fortiori where the procurement extends to the danger of life. And see
F. N. B. 116. F. Men conspire to have a false Office found of my Lands, which
Office is found by such procurement, Conspiracy lies: And the Statute of 2 E.
6. does not alter the Law before; for it is in the affirmative. See the
Statute, Cap. 24.

Gaudy, Justice, Conceived, That the Endictment did not excuse the Defendants
in this Action, but against those who are sworn to give Evidence for the King,
and not others; For they may well procure an Appeal maliciously,
notwithstanding the Endictment.

Walmesley, Sergeant, conceived, That the Action does not lie at the Common
Law; For in no case where the party uses but the means of the Law by the Kings
Writ, without any Corruption or Covin of the party, he shall be amerced only
pro falso clamore, and no Action lies against him, because he has not used
but the means of the Law. Which see, 2 R. 3. 9. by all the Justices. But yet in
an Appeal, because it touches the life of a Man, the Defendant shall have his
damages against the Plaintiff, but not in any other Action which is a vexation
by suit, if no Corporation or Covin be in the party who prosecutes such suit.
See such matter justifiable in Conspiracy, 35 H. 6. 13, 14. Afterward, the
principal Case was adjourned.

CXCI. Parker and Howard's Case. Pasch. 28 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
2 Len. 102.
IN Debt upon an Obligation, the Condition was, That whereas the Plaintiff and
Defendant be now jointly seized of the Office of the Register of the Court of
Admiralty, If the Defendant shall permit the Plaintiff to exercise the said
Office, and take the profits of it wholly to his own use during his life,
without let or interruption done by him, That then, etc. The Defendant pleaded,
That the Custom of the Realm of England is, That the Lord Admiral for the time
being, might grant the said Office, and that such Grant should be good but for
the life of the Grantor. And further showed, 1 Len. 103.
That the Lord Clynton, Lord Admiral, granted the said Office to the Plaintiff
and the Defendant, and died; And that the Lord Howard was appointed Lord
Admiral: And that he 27 Eliz. granted the said Office to one Wade, who put him
out, and interrupted him; before which time the Defendant suffered the
Plaintiff to enjoy the said Office, and to take the profits of it: Upon which
the Plaintiff demurred in Law.

Cook argued for the Plaintiff, That the Defendant's Plea was not good, for he
has not entitled the Lord Admiral to grant the Office; For he says, That the
Custom of the Realm of England is; which he has pleaded in such manner, as no
Issue can be taken upon it; for it is pleaded, Quod usitatum est quod Admirals
pro tempore existens, Non potest Concedere Officium praedict, nisi pro termino
vitae suae; and that cannot be, for it cannot be tried; for the Venire facias
cannot be, Of the Realm of England: Also, if it be, Through the whole Realm of
England, then the same is the Common Law, and not Consuetudo. Which see, Br.
Custom, 39. And see 4 and 5 Mar. Dyer, 152, 153. An express case of this
Office; And there he prescribes in Consuetudine in Anglia, etc. And also, that
such Grant is good but during the life of the Admiral who granted it. Also he
does not answer to any time of the Grant of the Admiral Howard; For if he were
lawfully put out by Wade, yet the Defendant against his own Obligation cannot
put us out, or interrupt us. As L. 5 E. 4. 115. In a Quare Impedit against an
Abbot and the Incumbent, who make default upon the distress; upon which a Writ
to the Bishop was awarded for the Plaintiff: Upon which the Bishop returned,
That the Incumbent resigned; of which the Bishop gave notice: And afterward
Lapse encurred, and the Bishop collated the said former Incumbent, and then
that Writ came to him. Now although the Incumbent be in by a new title, yet he
is bound by the Judgment. So here, although the Defendant had another title,
and the former title of the Plaintiff be determined; yet against his own Deed
and Obligation, he shall not put out the Plaintiff. And the Court was clear,
That the Judgment should be given for the Plaintiff. But afterward, the Cause
was Compounded by the Order of the Lord Chancellor.

CXCII. Mannings Case. Mich. 28 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
NOte: It was agreed by the Justices in this Case, That where an Enfant
Executor sold the Goods of his Testator at less undervalue than they were
worth; And afterward brought an Action of Detinue against the Vendee upon it
in retardatione executionis Testamenti; That this sale of the Enfant Executor
was good; and should bind him notwithstanding his Nonage.

CXCIII. Mich. 28 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
THe Case was; A Man made a Feoffment in Fee to the use of himself for life,
and afterward to the use of his eldest Son in tail, and afterward to the use
of his right Heirs, not having at the time of the Feoffment any Son:
Afterward, he suffered a Common Recovery, had Issue a Son, who died in the
life of his Father, having Issue a Son, and afterward he himself dies: It was
holden in this Case, That the Son and Heir of the Son, should not avoid this
Recovery by the Statute of 32 H. 8. For there was not any remainder in him at
the time of the Recovery had, but the remainder then was in abeyance; for then
the Son was not born: And the words of the said Statute are, That such Recovery
shall be void against such person to whom the Reversion or Remainder shall then
appertain; i. e. at the time of the Recovery. And it was said, That if Lands be
given to E. for life, the Remainder to B. in tail, the Remainder to C. in fee;
B. dies, his Wife with Child with a Son; A Recovery is had against E. with the
assent of C. and afterward the Son is born, he shall not be helped by this
Statute, for that the Remainder was not in esse at the time of the Recovery.
But it was holden in the principal Case, That the Heir might avoid this
Recovery by the Common Law: For the Recompense could not extend to such a
Remainder which was not in esse.

CXCIV. The Countess of Sussex and Wroth's Case. Hill. 28 Eliz. In the Common
Pleas.
IT was moved in this Case by Gaudy, Sergeant, If the Disseisee License J.S. to
put his Cattle into the Land whereof he was disseised; If it were a good
License? And, If by the Execution of the said License, the Freehold should be
revested in the Disseisee, so as if the Disseisor distrain the Cattle of J.S.
for Damage-feasant, and in a Replevin avow, the Plaintiff may plead, That the
Freehold was in the Disseisee who so Licensed him? Periam, Justice, The License
is void; For at the time of the grant of it, the Disseisee had but a Right
before he had recontinued the Land by re-entry. Windham, If the Disseisee make
a Lease for years of the Land, whereof he is Disseised, it is a void Lease.
Anderson, If the Disseisee command one to enter into the Land, and he does
accordingly, the same is good. The Case was adjourned.

CXCV. Payn's Case. Mich. 28 Eliz. In the Exchequer.
2 Len. 205.
A Writ of Error was brought by Pain, Treasurer of the Records in the
King's Bench, in the Exchequer-Chamber, upon a Judgment given in the Court of
the Exchequer for the Queen, upon an Assignment of a Lease for years by the
Countess of Oxford to the Queen; One Error was assigned, because whereas the
Issue was joined upon the Intrusion, and the taking of the profits, and so two
matters put in Issue; and the Jury have found Pain guilty of the Intrusion; but
have said nothing of the taking of the profits, and so the Verdict does not
meet fully with the Issue. The great matter of the Case was upon this Point;
The Information is, That the Assignment of the Queen was, 16 Maii, the
Intrusion 17 Maii, the Inrollment of the Deed of Assignment 18 Maii; And so it
appeared upon the Record, that the Intrusion is supposed to be done before that
the Queen had any Interest in the Land in which the Intrusion is supposed, for
nothing was in the Queen before the Enrollment: For the Queen is a Corporation
of State, of such Prerogative and Excellency, That she cannot give or take an
Interest in Land without matter of Record; And this Lease is a Chattel-real,
and an Interest in Land. See as to the Inrollment, 1 H. 7. 30. 31. 5 E. 4. 7. 7
E. 4. 16. But I agree, That if Lessee for years be Outlawed, the Lease shall be
in the King without Office, for the Outlawry it self is a sufficient Record to
entitle the King unto it. If the Queen makes a Lease for years of Lands
rendering Rent, with a Clause, That if the Rent be behind, that the Lease shall
cease, if the Rent be not paid. It was agreed here in Sir Moile Finch's Case,
That the Lessee continuing his possession, shall not be accounted an Intruder
before Office thereof found, but he shall be Accomptant to the Queen for the
profits as Bailiff of his own wrong: but here we are charged with Intrusion.

It has been doubted, If personal things are in the King without Office, 37 H.
6. But now it is clear they are. As 35 E. 3. Br. Prerogat. 113. The Villein of
the King purchases goods, the property thereof is in the King without seizure;
and so it is of all personal Chattels, because they are transitory, 1 H. 7. 17.
4 H. 7. 1. 39 H. 6. 26. And here it appears upon the Record, that this Deed
of Assignment was delivered to Baron Clark, 16 May, at Westminster. and that was
Ascension-day, and so non dies Juridicus, and so no Court there then holden,
and then the said Deed was not delivered in Court of Record, and then not
delivered to him as a Judge, but as a private person, although that it was
delivered to the use of the Queen. But in 37 H. 6. there is some Opinion, That
if such a Deed be delivered in Court to one of the Barons, or be put into the
Kings Coffers, that then it is a Record.

Atkins, to the contrary: And to the first Exception, It is to be known, That
in every Plea where a Contempt is laid to the charge of the Defendant, he ought
first to excuse his Contempt: And therefore here the Exordium of the Plea is,
Quoad venire vi and armis, and quicquid est in Contemptu Dominae Reginae,
necnon de tota ulteriore transgressione and Contemptu per ipsos supposit. Quod
ipse in nullo est inde Culpabilis: And afterward plead over: And so it is in
an Action of Trespass. And also upon the Statute of 8 H. 6. of Forcible Entry;
and here the Issue upon the Contempt does ensue the other Issue; For if the
other Issue is found against the Defendant, so also is this. As to the other
point I agree, That a Corporation cannot take or speak without writing: And the
King being a Corporation, and who only makes Corporations, cannot take but by
writing of as high a nature; scil. by Record: And we have here a Record (as is
granted by the other side) being enrolled 18 May, which was delivered 16 May;
and being once enrolled, it has relation to the time of the delivery; i. e. to
16 May; And then Pain upon the whole matter was an Intrudor 17 May: and an
Intrudor by his Entry does not gain any thing against the Queen; and therefore
the Information of the Intrusion is, diversis diebus and vicibus intrusit;
althought it be but one continued possession; and therefore every Instant
during his possession, he is an Intrudor. As to the delivery of the Deed of
Assignment upon the day of the Ascension, which is not dies Juridicus, that is
not material. As 12 E. 4. 8. by Pigot, If the day of Retorn of a Writ, i. e. 4
to die, falls upon a Sunday, it is good enough, although no Court can then be
holden but the day following, and the Plea is not discontinued; And this
delivery of the Deed of Assignment might be made out of Term there upon any day
in the Term which is not dies Juridicus. Contrary, where the thing is of
necessity to be done in the Term; as in the Case between Fish and Brocket, of
Proclamations made upon a Fine; For a Man may acknowledge a Recognizance or a
Deed to be enrolled in the time of Vacation, etc.

Tanfield, As to the Interest, the Enrollment has relation, not as to the
profits; for Pain cannot be Intrudor 17 May, by any Relation.

Popham, The Queens Attorney, When an Information of Intrusion and taking of the
profits is here exhibited, the Defendant ought to justify his Entry; and if
the Entry be found against him, so as his Entry is an Intrusion, then the
illegal taking of the profits is found also. And he said, That the Deed
acknowledged and delivered to the Baron, is a Record, although not enrolled, be
the acknowledgment thereof in Court, or out of Court. If an Information upon a
penal Law be exhibited to a Baron of the Exchequer out of Court, and afterward
another Informer exhibits another Information upon the same Statute for the
same Offense against the same person, and that is exhibited in the Court before
the first; The first Information shall be preferred, and the Defendant shall
answer to that, and not to the other: and for exhibiting the same in Court, or
out of Court, it is not material. And the Assignment when it is enrolled, has
relation unto the acknowledging of it. A Reversion is granted to one for life,
the Remainder to the King; the particular Tenant attorns to the King, the
Remainder is not in the King by the Attornment; but if the Deed be afterward
enrolled, it shall be said to be in the King from the time of the Attornment:
And the King shall have the benefit of all the mean profits from the time of
the Attornment. A Lease for years is made by the King, reserving Rent, with a
clause, That if the Rent be not paid, that the Lease shall be void: the Rent is
not paid 10 years, after an Office is found, the King shall be answered all the
profits from the time of default in payment of the Rent. And although no
Intrusion can be laid in the Information 17 May, yet it shall be good for the
18th day.

Cook, The Judgment for the Queen upon an Information of Intrusion, is, Quod
defendens, de Intrusione, transgressione, and Contemptu praedict. convincatur,
etc. And afterward, a Commission shall issue forth, for to enquire of the Mean
profits, and there the Defendant may show this matter in taking of the damages:
And if the Intrusion be at any time in the Information, it is sufficient enough
to have Judgment upon it: and in our Case, the Continuance is laid 18 May.

Egerton, Solicitor, The Record warrants the Judgment given upon it; For
possession laid in the Queen, is sufficient to this Information. And here Pain
does not answer the Queens title, but traverseth the Intrusion, And therefore
he being found Intrudor by Verdict, Judgment ought to be given upon it. For the
Jury have found the Intrusion generally, and specially, 17 May. And that cannot
be assigned for Error; for it is part of the Verdict, of which Error does not
lie, but Attaint: For if any Error was, it was in the Jury, and not in the
Court. Which Manwood Concessit.

Tanfield, As to the Case of Continuance of an Intrusion, it is clear, That
every continuance ought to have a beginning; for a thing, which has no
beginning, cannot be continued; and here is not any beginning: for the
beginning which is laid in the Information, is pretended to be 17 May; and that
cannot be, causa qua supra.

Popham, If an Information be brought of an Intrusion, where in truth there is
not any Record to prove it, and the Jury find the Intrusion, shall you have a
Writ of Error upon it? And every continuance of Intrusion, is an Intrusion.
This Matter had been good Evidence to the Jury. Sed non habet locum hic, etc.

CXCVI. Sir John Southwell's Case. Hill. 28 Eliz. In the Exchequer.
SIr John Southwel of the County of Lanc. 7 July, 2 Len. 132.
19 Eliz. made a Conveyance of all his Land to diverse Feoffees and their Heirs,
upon Condition, That they should find him and his Wife, and so many persons in
his House, etc. prefer his Daughters in Marriage, pay his Debts, etc. And if
there fell out at the years end upon Account made by the Feoffees any
surplusage, that then at the end of every such year they should answer such
surplusage as should then remain in their hands unexpended of the Rents and
Profits of his said Lands, with Clause of Revocation, etc. Afterward, the said
Conveyance being in force, came the Statute of 23 Eliz. concerning Recusants:
Upon which Statute, the said Southwel was now Indicted: And afterward, a
Commission issued out of the Exchequer to the Sheriff of Lancast. to enquire of
the Lands of the says Southwel; And although against the said Conveyance it
was given in Evidence, That after that Conveyance, the said Sir John Southwel
had granted Trees out of the said Lands, and had taken Fines and Incomes for
Leases, etc. Yet the Jurors, charged to enquire, would not find, That the said
Sir John had any Lands, etc. And by special Commandment of the Queen, it was
referred out of the Exchequer, to all the Justices of England, If the Lands of
the said Sir John Southwel contained ut supra, were subject to the said
Statute, and the penalties thereof? And upon great deliberation had, It was by
them all Resolved and Agreed, That notwithstanding that Conveyance, the said
Lands were liable to the said Statute. And as to the Jurors which against their
Evidence given unto them for the Qeeen, gav their Verdict, ut supra; process
was awarded against them out of the said Court, for to appear before the Lord
Treasurer, and the Barons of the Exchequer: And for their said Contempt, they
were committed to the Fleet, and each of them fined 20 l.

CXCVII. Hill. 28 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
IN a Writ of Entry Sur Disseisin, The Tenant said, That the House in demand is
within the City of London; and that the said City is antiqua Civitas; And that
King Hen. 3. Concessit civibus Civitatis praedict. quod non implacitentur de
Terris and Tenementis suis, etc. extra muros Civitatis praedict. And further
said, That he himself is Civis London, etc. and demanded Judgment of the Writ:
( Note, in the pleading before, the Tenant said) and illis rectum teneatur
intra Civitatem praedictam secundum Consuetudinem Civitatis praedict. And to
this Plea, Exception was taken, because that the Tenant does not show before
whom by their Custom they ought to be impleaded. It was the Opinion of the
whole Court, That the Tenant ought to have showed, That the Citizens for their
Lands ought to be impleaded in the Hustings, etc. And the general words in the
plea; scil. Sed illis rectum teneatur intra Civitatem praedictam secundum
Consuetudinem Civitatis praedict. did not supply the defect aforesaid. After,
It was awarded by the Court, That the Tenant answer further, etc.

CXCVIII. The Lord Anderson's Case. Mich. 29 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
THe Lord Anderson, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, 1 Roll. 189.
brought an Action of Trespass by Bill, for breaking of his House in the City
of Worcester. against one A. Citizen of the said City: Now came the Mayor and
Communalty of the said City, and showed their Charter granted to them by King
E. 6. and demanded Conusans of Pleas. And by the Award of the whole Court, the
Conusans shall not be granted, because that the Privilege of this Court
whereof the Plaintiff is a principal Member, is more ancient than the Patent,
upon which the Conusans is demanded. For the Justices, Clarks and Attorneys of
this Court, ought to be here attending to do their Offices and Services, as
belongs unto them, and shall not be impleaded, or compelled to implead others
elsewhere than in this Court. And this Privilege was given to this Court upon
the Original Erection of it. And such was the Opinion of the whole Court. And
as for the Conusans, it was denied.

CXCIX. Cocket and Robston's Case. Mich. 29 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
ARthur Cocket, Thomas Andrews, and A. his Wife, 2 Len. 118. Post. 192. 230. 1
Len. 219. 1 Len. 302.
brought an Action of Account against Robston, and Declared, That one Mountford
by the hands of Jo. Wase, had delivered 100l. to the Defendant pro relevamine
of the said Arthur and Anne. The Defendant pleaded, Ne unque Receiver pur
account render: Upon which they were at Issue. And Judgment was given, That the
Defendant should account: Who, before Auditors assigned, alleged, That he had
expended the said 100l. in the Education of the said Arthur and Anne, by the
space of 8 years after the delivery of the said 100l. Upon which they were at
Issue. And upon Evidence it was showed on the Plaintiffs part, That heretofore
the said Arthur brought a Writ of Account against the said Robston, as Guardian
in Socage for the Land of the said Arthur descended; And upon the said Account,
the said Robston demanded allowance of 20 Marks by the year for the said 8
years, for the Education of the said Arthur, which was allowed to him; so as
now he shall not be received to demand allowance for the said 8 years for the
Education of the said Arthur out of the Account of the said 100l. and that was
fully proved to the Jury. It was moved, How the Jury should demean themselves
in their Verdict? For the Issue is, That the Defendant had expended the whole
100l. in the Education of the said Arthur and Anne. And some were of Opinion,
If the Defendant had expended part in the Education of the said Anne only, yet
the Jury ought to find for the Plaintiffs: For the Issue is entire upon the
expending of the said 100l. in the Education of the said Arthur and Anne,
without saying how much for the said Arthur, and how much for the said Anne.
But Periam and Anderson, Justices, were clear to the contrary: Wherefore they
advised the Jury to find specially, if they conceived, that the Defendant had
expended any part of the 100l. and to find it, and how much. And after the Jury
found against the Defendant, That nothing was expended, etc. And gave damages
20l. And the Justices at the first doubted, If damages should be given in an
Account? But at length they received the Verdict, by the manner, de been esse.
See 2 R. 2. Fitz. Account. 45. 2 H. 7. 13. 10 H. 6. 18. 21 H. 6. 26. And the
Book of Entries, 17. in such case damages were given.

CC. Tooley and Preston's Case. Hill. 29 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
1 Len. 397. 1 Cro. 206. 2 Len. 105.
IN an Action upon the Case by Tooley against Preston, (which see, Mich. 29
Eliz. Reported in Leon. 1. Part, fol. 297.) Judgment was given for the
Plaintiff; And now upon the Retorn of the Writ of Enquiry of Damages, It was
moved, That for as much as the Damages are excessive, viz. 200l. that the Court
de Gratia would abridge the Damages: But the whole Court was against it; For
that they as Judges cannot know what prejudice and damage the Plaintiff has
sustained, by the wrongful detaining of the said Recognizance, but the Jury may
well have notice of such matter: And as the Case is here, the damages are but
uncertain upon the Assumpsit: For the Defendant assumed, That if he did not
redeliver the said Recognizance to the Plaintiff to pay him 1000 l. so as the
damages are reduced to certainty by the promise of the Defendant himself. And
by Anderson, If I bail to you an Obligation, to rebail the same to me before
such a day one 10l. now upon not delivery at such a day, I shall have an Action
of Debt for the 10l. contrary, by Windham. And by Anderson, in the principal
Case, If the Defendant had pleaded Non Assumpsit, and the Jury had found the
promise, they might have given 1000l. damages, without danger of an Attaint,
notwithstanding that the Plaintiff could not prove that he was damnified one
penny, and that by reason of the express Assumpsit of the Defendant.

CCI. Bingham and Squire's Case. Hill. 29 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
BIngham brought Debt upon an Obligation against Squire; 4 Len. 61:
The Condition was, That if the said Squire procure a Grant of the next
Avoidance of the Arch-Deaconry of Stafford, to be made to the said Bingham, so
that the said Bingham at such next Avoidance may present, That then, etc. And
the Case was, That afterward by the means and endeavor of Squire, the Grant
of the said next Avoidance was made to Bingham. But before the next Avoidance,
the present Archdeacon was created a Bishop, so as the presentment to that
Avoidance appertained to the Queen: It was adjudged in this Case, That the
Condition was not performed, and that by reason of these words, (So that
Bingham may Present;) And afterward the Plaintiff had Judgment to recover.

CCII. Rolt's Case. Hill. 29 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
THe Case was; A Lease is made to two, durante vita ipsorum and alterius eorum
diutius vivent. absque impetitione Vasti, durante vita ipsorum; The one of them
dies: Now although some conceived there was a difference between the
Limitation of the Estate, and of the Liberty, etc. for the Limitation of the
estate seems to be more liberal; Yet it was agreed by the whole Court, That the
Liberty runs with the Estate, and shall endure as long.

CCIII. Farmer and Dorington's Case. Hill. 29 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
AN Action upon the Case for these words, I will prove Farmer to be a perjured
Knave. It was moved, The words are not Actionable; for it is not a mere
affirmation. But after many motions; It was holden by the whole Court, That
upon those words, an Action did well lie.

CCIV. Allen and Hill's Case. Mich. 29 and 30 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
1 Cro. 238.
IN an Ejection Firm by Allen against Hill of a House in Cornhill in London;
Upon Not guilty pleaded, The Jury found this special matter; viz. That one
Francis Beneson was seized of the said House in Fee; and 4 Eliz. devised the
same to Anne his Wife for life, in full satisfaction of all her Thirds in
London; and after her death, to Tho. Beneson his Brother in Fee: Proviso, That
if Anne clearly (the words of the Verdict are totaliter) depart out of London,
and dwell in the Country, that then she shall have a Rent out of the said
House. And the Jury found further, That Francis died without Issue; and that
afterward Thomas died, Robert being his next Heir; And that 14 Eliz. Anne
clearly departed out of London, and went to Melton in the County of Suffolk:
And that afterward Robert before any Entry, released unto Anne; and afterward
against his Release entered. It was argued for the Defendant, That by this
Proviso, and the departure of Anne out of London, the Freehold was not out of
her, and vested in Robert, before the entry of Robert; For if it were out of
Anne, then is she but Tenant at sufferance, to whom a Release made cannot
enure; And the words of the Will are not, That her Estate shall cease. And here
as the case is, Anne cannot be Tenant at sufferance to him in the Remainder,
betwixt whom and her there is not any privity. See 18 E. 4. 25, 26. Tenant for
the term of the life of another, the Remainder over in Fee, Cestuy que vie
dies; The Tenant remained Tenant until he in the Remainder entered upon him.
And so in our Case, although Anne has clearly departed out of London, etc. yet
the Freehold of the House does continue in her, until the Entry of Robert, and
then the Release made to her is good. Also the Breach of the Condition is not
fully found; For the Proviso is, If she clearly departs out of London, (but it
does not stay there) and dwell in the Country, etc. And here it is found, That
she clearly departed out of London; but they have not found, that she dwelt in
the Country, etc. but only that she went to Melton; but she ought to do does
before her Estate shall cease. It was argued by Towse for the Plaintiff, That
the Defendant ought to be found guilty of the Ejectment; For it is found, That
the Defendant entered before the Commandment of Anne; but they have not found,
that Anne was alive.

Fenner, Justice, the same is well enough: and so it was holden, 18 Eliz. in
this Court; for although her life be not found, yet it shall be intended, that
she was alive: For the Jury did not doubt of it; and the Conclusion of the
Verdict is, That if it shall seem to the Court that his Entry is lawful. Then
the Defendant is not guilty. So as the doubt of the Jury is only upon that
point. Which Wray concessit.

Gaudy, Justice, If one Devises Land to one for life, upon Condition, That his
Estate shall cease (which is all one with the Case at Bar,) and after the
breach of the Condition he continues in possessions, he is not Tenant for
life, but Tenant at sufferance.

Wray, Chief Justice; Tenant for the life of another continues in possession
after the death of Cestuy que vie, he has not any Freehold remaining in him;
for if he dies, nothing descends. And so it was lately adjudged by all the
Justices of England, upon a Conference had between them: And the Book of 18 E.
4. is not Law. Which Gaudy, Justice, concessit. See 35 H. 8. 57. acc. And he
said, That the same shall be as a Limitation by which the Estate shall cease
without an Entry. And here in this Case, because they have not found, That Anne
had dwelt in the Country, here is no breach of the Condition in the Case. And
afterward, by the Advice of the whole Court, Judgment was given for the
Defendant, Quod querens nihil Capiat per Billam.

CCV. Cadee and Oliver's Case. Mich. 29 and 30 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
IN an Ejectione Firmae by Cadee against Oliver, 1 Cro. 152. Roll. Tit. Grant.
48.
of a House in Holborn, etc. The Case was, The Lord Mountjoy, and the Lady
Katherine his Wife, seized of the said House, and of other Lands in Fee in the
right of the Wife; 6 Eliz. acknowledged a Statute-Staple of 1200 l. to Sir
Lyonel Ducket: Afterward, 9 Eliz. the said Lord Mountjoy and his said Wife
Leased the said House to Hoskins for 21 years; And afterward by Indenture, 11
Eliz. they Leased the same to Sir Tho. Cotton for 99 years, to begin at
Michaelmas last past: 12 Eliz. Sir Lyonel Ducket extended his Statute; and the
Land extended was delivered to him at 53 l. 7 s. per annum; who held the same
until 22 Eliz. Anno 23 Eliz. the Lord Mountjoy and his Wife levied a Fine to
Perry, to the use of Perry and his Heirs: 27 Eliz. Sir Thomas Cotton not being
upon the Land, granted omnia tunc bona and catalla sua, to Robert Cotton his
Son: 28 Eliz. the Lady Mountjoy died. Mich. 29 Eliz. the Lease to Hoskins
expired: Perry entered, and Leased the House to Oliver the Defendant for 21
years; And afterward, Robert Cotton entered, and Leased the House, etc. to the
Plaintiff. It was first moved by Brantingham, and argued by him, If this Lease
for 99 years which was made to begin after the Lease made to Hoskins, should
pass to Robert Cotton by the words aforesaid? But the Court eased him from
arguing of that point; for it was holden, That it passed, notwithstanding the
word tunc. 1 Cro. 386.
Another matter argued by him, was, because at the time of the Grant, the Lands
were in extent, and so the said Sir Thomas Cotton had but a possibility, If
therefore the said Grant, made during the Extent, was good? And he argued, That
it was; for it is more than a bare possibility, for it is an Interest vested:
And in some Cases, a possibility may be granted. As 19 H. 6. 2. The King
granted to a Prior, That when any Tenth is granted to the King by the Clergy,
his House shall be discharged of it, etc. And 19 E. 2. Avowry, 224. The Lord
grants to his Tenant, That if he dies, his Heir within age, that such Heir
shall not be in Ward. So 21 E. 4. 44. A Grant unto an Abbot to be discharged of
the Collectorship of Tenths when it shall be granted by the Clergy. It has
been Objected, That the Term for 99 years is suspended, therefore it cannot be
granted during the suspension. But the same is not so; for, a thing suspended
may be granted: As 15 Eliz. Dyer, 319. Husband and Wife Ioynt-Tenants of Lands
in Fee, The Queen having a Rent out of it in Fee, gives the Rent to the
Husband and his Heirs; now the Husband Devises the said Rent, and dies; the
same is good a Devise, notwithstanding the suspension: And he cited the Cases,
16 E. 3. Quid juris clamat, 22. And 20 E. 3. ibid. 31. A Lease is made to one
for life; and if he dies within 20 years, that his Executors and Assigns shall
hold the Land until the expiration of the 20 years, the said Interest may be
granted. Which Wray, Chief Justice, denied. See Gravenors Case, 3 and 4 Ma.
Dyer, 150. such Interest is void. It was further moved by him, and argued, If
the Conusee of the Fine might avoid the Lease made to Sir Thomas Cotton? And he
said, He could not; for he is in under the Lessors. So is 34 E. 1. Recovery in
value, 36. see the Case there. And here, although the Wife after the death of
her Husband may affirm, or disaffirm the Lease at her Election; yet this
Election is not transferred to the Conusee by the Fine; but the Conusee shall
be bound by the Fine. See 33 H. 8. Dyer, 51. As Tenant in tail makes a Lease
for years not warranted by the Statute, and dies, the Issue alieneth the Land
by Fine, before affirmation or disaffirmation of the Lease by acceptance or
Entry, the Conusee cannot avoid this Lease; for the Liberty is not transferred.
Which Gaudy, Justice, concessit. And Election cannot be transferred over to the
prejudice of another person. As if a Rent de novo be granted to the Father in
Fee, who dies before Election, the Heir cannot make it an Annuity to defeat
the Dower of the Wife, quod Curia concessit. It was also moved by Brantingham,
If the Lessee might enter upon the Conusee of the Statute after his Extent
expired, without suing forth a Scire facias: But the Court discharged him from
arguing that Point; for that by the Death of the Lady Mountjoy, the Extent was
void; and therefore the Feoffee or Conusee might avoid it by Entry: And so
Wray, Chief Justice, said, it had been adjudged in the Court of Common Pleas.
At another day, the Case was argued by Stephens on the part of the Plaintiff;
who said, That the Extent by computation of time according to the value to
which it was extended, is not yet satisfied: The Verdict has found, that the
Extent continued until 22 Eliz. hut does not say, that it was then expired and
ended. And I conceive also, that this Extent does not evict the Interest of Sir
Thomas Cotton, or turn it into a possibility; The extent is Quousque leventur
denarii; but yet a Limitation of time is in Law understood, although by a
Casualty such time may be abridged or extended. Which see, 15 H. 7. 16. by
Fairfax, Where a Man is bounden by Statute to pay 40 l. and the Conusee sueth
Execution upon it, and the Land extended is rated at 10 l. per annum: now it
shall be intended, by a common intent, that in 4 years the party may be
satisfied; and therefore after the 4 years the Conusor shall have a Scire
facias: so upon the matter it is a Lease for 4 years. So 7 H. 7. 12. by Keble
to the same purpose. And 15 E. 4. 5. by Brian; for the Law shall not intend a
casualty without alleging of it; for the same shall not be by imagination. And
therefore, If the Conusor will have the Land within the Term, he ought to
allege, That the Conusee has levied the duty by an extraordinary Casualty,
and show it specially. And so where the Conusor sueth a Scire facias, and the
Conusee will hold the Land over, he ought expressly to surmise some
extraordinary occasion wherefore he could not levy the duty upon the Land
within the Term: Which see by Brian, 15 E. 4. 5. and 44 E. 3. The Conusee of a
Statute after extent makes a Lease for 3 years; yet it may be that the duty
shall be levied within one year; but if it be so, then a Scire facias shall
issue forth against the Conusee, and not against the Lessee; for the Law
intends, that the whole estate of the Conusee is not granted, but that he has
a Reversion in him; but if he has granted his whole estate, then a Scire
facias shall issue forth the Grantee. So here, although that this extent in our
Case would continue by computation of time for some of the years of the Term
granted to Sir Thomas Cotton: yet it is intended, that the extent did run out,
and was determined before the expiration of Sir Thomas Cotton's Term; so as,
notwithstanding that, Sir Thomas Cotton has an Interest left in him which he
may grant. It will be Objected, How can it be said an Estate for years, when as
he might hold over the years? As to that, such an Interest may be put off in
diverse Cases; As, 15 H. 7. A Man grants to another the third Avoidance of such
a Church, and dies seized, his Wife is endowed of the Church, she shall have
the third Avoidance, and the Grantee shall have the 4th Avoidance, and so per
talem intervenientem occasionem, the benefit shall be delayed; and so here in
our case: And then the estate by Extent being prima facie certain, so as it
cannot by intendment surmount the Term of Sir Tho. Cotton, as it appears upon
the Extent; the estate shall be taken to continue according to the extent of
the years, and then a certain Interest does remain in Sir Thomas Cotton, which
he may grant over, which is not a possibility, but rather a Reversion: So, and
to such purpose, is the Case of 7 H. 5. 3 and 4. If the eldest Son enters
after the death of his Father, and afterward his Mother recovereth Dower, that
shall take away the possessio fratris; but if the Son makes a Lease for life,
and the Wife recovereth Dower against the Lessee, there shall be possessio
fratris, for the Reversion does remain in the Lessor, notwithstanding the
eviction of the estate for life. And 7 H. 6. 2. there it is holden by Goddard
and Strange, That where the Term of the Wife was extended upon the Statute of
the Husband, who died, the Wife shall have the residue of the Term, and avoid
the extent as to her Term, which proves that all the Term is not drawn to the
Conusee by the Extent, but that an Interest does remain in the Lessee
notwithstanding that. And see by Seton, 29 Ass. 64. If Lessee for life Leaseth
to him in the Reversion for life, yet he has a Reversion in him, And 31 Ass.
6. A. is bound by Statute to B. and his Land extended by force of it: C.
recovers against B. in Debt, and the Land extended by him upon the Statute, 1
Roll. 887.
is now extented by Elegit; A. grants his Estate to the Conusee, it is no
surrender; which proves, that B. has an Interest. And so in our Case, an
Interest does remain in Sir Thomas Cotton, notwithstanding the Extent. A. makes
a Lease for years to begin at a day to come, and before the day, A. is
disseised; The Lessee notwithstanding this Disseisin, may grant his Interest,
for he never was in possession, and therefore it cannot be turned into a Right.

As to the second point, If Robert Cotton may enter within the time of the
Extent, without a Scire facias: and that rests upon this point; If this Lease
shall be subject to the Extent? I conceive clearly, that it shall not. It has
been said, That our Lease is not good: But I conceive it without question, that
our Lease is good enough; For it is made by the Husband and Wife: and the Wife
after the death of her Husband by Acceptance of the Rent, might affirm the
Lease: But the Statute is the act of the Husband alone; therefore the Conusee
of the Fine shall not avoid the Lease, for it is but voidable. So the King
grants Lands durante beneplacito, and afterward grants the Reversion over, the
Patentee shall not avoid the Estate; But if this Lease had been made by the
Husband only, it had been void, and then the Conusee of the Fine should avoid
it; as it was lately adjudged in Harvy and Thomas 's Case. And I conceive, That
if Tenant in tail acknowledges a Statute, and afterward makes a Lease
according to the Statute of 32 H. 8. and dies, the Lessee shall not hold the
Land subject to the Statute, for then the Rent should not be paid to the Issue
in tail during the Statute, which is against the Stat. of 32 H. 8. And see
also, 8 Eliz. Dyer, 252. The Chaplain of a Donative Chapel Leased for 99
years, which was confirmed by the Patron, who was Tenant in tail of the
Patronage which was appendant to a Manor, whereof he was seized in tail; and
afterward he had Issue, and died; The Statute of Chauntries comes; after the
death of the Incumbent, the King shall avoid this Lease. And in our Case, after
the Coverture, the Conusee is in by the Wife, and then he shall avoid the
Statute extended upon it: And if so, then there needs not any Scire facias;
as the Issue in tail may enter upon the Conusee of a Statute acknowledged by
his Father; For if Execution had been sued against the Issue in tail, it had
been a Disseisin. And see 2 R. 3. 7. That in such case, the Wife, or her Heirs,
may enter upon the Conusee; And by Consequence, the Conusee who is in by her,
etc.

Cook, contrary; I conceive, that this Grant of this Lease by Sir Thomas Cotton
to his Son, is not good; 2 Roll. 48; 1 Cro. 15. 1 Inst. 22. b.
for it is but a possibility, and no Interest: I agree all the Cases which have
been put before, for Law, but they cannot be applied to this Case; The Book in
7 H. 6. 2. is, That if the Term of the Wife be extended upon the Statute of the
Husband, that the Wife shall have the residue after the death of the Husband;
but it does not say, that the Wife or her Husband may grant it during the
Extent; which is the matter now in Question. And I conceive, That Sir Thomas
Cotton has but a possibility; For the Conusee upon the Extent has but an
uncertain Interest: And although it may be by some means reduced to a certainty
in the Chancery, where the Costs and Damages shall be assessed; yet until it be
reduced to a certainty, it cannot be granted. And therefore it is clear, That
if I have a Term for 8 years in Land, and grant it unto another until he has
levied 100 l. and all his Costs of suit for it, by this Grant all the Interest
of the Term is in the Grantee, and nothing is in me, but a possibility. 8 Co.
Mannings Case.
And so it was holden in the Common Pleas by the Lord Anderson, the day when he
was made Chief Justice there, At which time, this Case was put; Lands of the
yearly value of 20 l. are Leased to one until he has levied 100 l. And the
matter was, What estate the Grantee has? And it was holden, That if Livery be
not made, that he has but an estate at Will, for the profits of the Lands are
uncertain, the one year more, and the other year less: And Bromley, Lord
Chancellor was then of the same Opinion. Then, if in case of a Lease it be so,
it shall also be so in case of an Extent; and in both the Cases, the whole
Interest is out of the parties. And 19 Eliz. the Case was in this Court, That
the Lessee for years devised his Term to his Executors for the payment of his
Debts and Legacies; and after the payment of them, the residue of the years he
devised to his Son: The Executors enter, which is an assent to the remainder;
he in the remainder grants his Interest: And it was holden void, because it was
but a possibility, and so uncertain: and although it might be reduced to a
Certainty afterward, yet the same is not sufficient; for it ought to be
reduced to a certainty at the time of the grant. And 17 Eliz. in this Court the
Case was, That Land was given to the Husband and Wife, and to the Heirs of the
Husband; the Husband makes a Lease for years, and dies; the Wife enters, and
entermarrieth with the Lessee: And it was moved, If the Interest of the Lessee
by the entermarriage, was extinct? And it was holden, That it was not; for it
was but a possibility, and not an Interest, quod fuit concessum per totam
Curiam. And if a possibility cannot be extinct, then it cannot be granted. And
he denied the Case put by Stephens, Where a Man seized of Lands Leaseth the
same for years to begin at a day to come, and afterward before the day, the
Lessor is disseised; now during that Dissesin, the Grantee cannot enter for his
future Interest; For the Feesimple being turned into a Right, so also shall be
the Interest. And that is proved by Delamere's Case, A Feoffment in Fee was
made to the use of A. for life, and afterward to the use of C. for life, and
afterward to the use of D. in Fee; and afterward A. enfeoffed a stranger, who
had notice of the use; The same does take away all the other uses; and said
Feoffee although he had notice of the use, yet he shall not be seized to the
first use, for the estate out of which the first uses do arise, is taken away;
and then also the uses. And he said also, That the Lease made to Sir Thomas
Cotton is not good; for it was made, 11 Eliz. And it is found by Verdict, That
10 Eliz. a Writ of Extent issued forth upon the Statute, then was the Lands in
the hands of, etc. during which time, the Lord Mount joy and his Wife could not
make the Lease aforesaid to the said Sir Thomas Cotton. And as to that, see 5
E. 3. Retorn of the Sheriff, 99. See the Case of 3 E. 6. Dyer, 67.
Stringfellow's Case. Then admitting the Lease to Sir Thomas Cotton, yet the
Lessee cannot put out the Conusee without a Scire facias; for the Conusee is in
by matter of Record. Also here, this Lease made by the Husband and Wife without
any Rent reserved, is utterly void, and then the Conusee shall take advantage
of it, 9 H. 7. 24 18 E. 4. 2. And so was it ruled in the Case of Seniori puero,
in the case of an Enfant. And see 7 Eliz. Dyer, 239. Where the Provost of Wells
being Parson impersonee of the Patronage of W. Leased the Tithe for 50 years,
rendering Rent, which was confirmed by the Dean and Chapter, but not by the
Patron and Ordinary: And afterward by Act of Parliament, the Provostry was
united to the Deanery cum primo vacare contigerit; The Provost died, the Dean
accepts the Rent; The same shall not bind the Church, for the Lease is void,
as it is of a Parson, or Prebend, etc. And so the Dean shall take advantage of
it, although not privy to it. See 16 Eliz. Dyer, 337. Lands given to a Parson
and his Successors for to find Lights, and he Leaseth the same for life; The
Rent is so employed accordingly: The Incumbent dies, The Successor accepts
the Rent; the King grants it over, The Patentee shall avoid the Lease, as the
Successor might have done before the Statute, if he had not accepted the Rent:
but the acceptance before the Statute shall bind the Successor, for that it was
but a voidable Lease. And the Case between Harvy and Thomas, which has been
put on the other side, serves to our purpose, for there the Conusee shall avoid
a Lease in Law which is void; and here, in the Principal Case, the Lease is
void; for that no Rent is reserved upon it. Wherefore, etc. It was adjourned.

CCVI. Beadle's Case. Mich. 29 and 30 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
THe Case was, That A. Leased to B. certain Lands for 40 l. per annum; 2 Len.
115.
And a stranger Covenanted with A. That B. should pay him 40 l. for the Farm
and Occupation of the said Lands: A. brought an Action of Covenant; The
Defendant pleaded, That before the day of payment, the Plaintiff put the said
B. out of his Farm: It was moved by Godfrey, That the same is no plea; For this
is a Collateral sum, and not for Rent issuing out of the Land: Also, the
Defendant is a stranger to the Contract for the Farm. But the Opinion of the
whole Court was clear to the contrary; For the Defendant has Covenanted, That
the Lessee shall pay for the said Farm and Occupation 40 l. so as it is as a
Conditional Covenant, and here is Quid pro quo, and here the Consideration upon
which the Covenant is conceived, scil. the Farm, and the Occupation of it, is
taken away by the Act of the Plaintiff himself; and therefore the plea is good,
and the Action will not lie.

CCVII. The Archbishop of York, and Morton's Case. Pasch. 29 Eliz. In the
Common Pleas.
THe Archbishop of York recovered in an Assise of Novel Disseisio, against one
Morton, before the Justices of Assise; 1 Len. 55.
upon which Judgment, Morton brought a Writ of Error, retornable before the
Justices of the Common Pleas; And after many Motions at the Bar, it was
adjudged, That a Writ of Error upon such Judgment does not lie in the said
Court. Which see 8 Eliz. Dyer, 250. See also, N. B. 22. e. That upon Erroneous
Judgment given in the King Bench in Ireland, Error shall be in the Kings Bench
in England, 15 E. 3. Error, 72. And Fenner, who was of Counsel with the
Archbishop, demanded of the Court, How, and in what manner the Record shall be
sent back to the Justices of Assise, so as the said Archbishop might have
Execution? To which the Court answered, That the surest way is to have a
Certiorari out of the Chancery into the Common Pleas directed to the Judges
there; and then out of the Chancery by a Mittimus to the Justices of Assise:
But Fenner made a doubt to take such Course for such remanding. Then Anderson,
Chief Justice, said, Sue Execution out of the said Record; for in as much as
the Record came before us by Writ of Error, it shall also be removed and sent
back by Writ. And so it was done.

CCVIII. The Queen and Hurleston's Case. Hill. 29 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
2 Len. 194.
THe Queen brought a Scire facias against Hurleston, to Repeal a Patent made to
him of the Constableship of Chester, and Judgment was given for the Queen; And
now Hurleston brought a Writ of Error against the Queen in the Kings Bench. And
it was moved by Gaudy, Sergeant, That the Writ did not lie for the manner, for
that he ought first to have sued to the Queen by Petition. See 22 E. 3. 3. and
23 E. 3. Fitz. Error, 9. If the King recover by an Erroneous Judgment, a Writ
of Error cannot be granted upon such a Recovery, sine gratia Regis speciali.
And he said, That in Chester, they have Courts of Common Pleas, Kings Bench,
Exchequer, and Chancery; And that if Judgment Erroneous be given in the
Chancery at Westminster, It cannot be reversed, but by Parliament; and so it is
of an Erroneous Judgment given in the Chancery at Chester. Also he said, They
have a Custom in London, That within one month they may reverse their own
Judgment. See 23 Eliz. Dyer 376. Erroneous Judgment given in the 5 Ports,
cannot be reversed in the King Bench; but it is reversable in the Court of the
Guardian of the 5 Ports.

Clench, Here both the parties claim by the Queen, therefore there needs no
Petition; for, valeat quantum valere poterit, it is no prejudice to the Queen.

Cook, There needs no Petition here, for the Attorney General has subscribed
our Writ of Error.

Egerton, Solicitor General, It was the Case of Eliz. Mordant, who was to
reverse a Fine levied during her Nonage; and the proceedings were stayed,
because she had not sued to the Qeen by Petition. See the Case of 24 E. 3. 35.
the Case of William de Ingularby, who sued to reverse a Judgment given against
him in a Writ of Conspiracy in the Air of Derby; and there it was said by
Thorp, Justice, That he must first sue to the King by Petition.

Wray, An Outlawry may be reversed by bringing a Writ of Error, without suing
Petition to the King.

CCIX. Beckwith's Case. Hill. 29 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
5 Co. 19.
ROger Beckwich by Indenture Tripartite, between him of the first part; William
Vavasour, Frances Slingsby, and Elizabeth Sister of Roger, of the second part;
George Harvey, and Frances Wife of the said George, (the said Frances being
another of the Sisters of the said Roger) of the third part; Covenant with the
aforesaid William Vavasour, and Frances Vavasour his Daughter, and with the
aforesaid George and Frances, and cum quolibet and qualibet eorum, That the
said Roger at the sealing and delivery of the said Indenture, was lawfully and
solely seized of the Rectory of Aldingfleet in the County of York, discharged
of all Encumbrances; Francis Vavasour took to Wife Frances Slingsby; And Note,
That by the same Indenture, Roger Beckwith Conveyed the said Rectory to the
said Francis Vavasour; Francis Slingsby and Frances his Wife, brought an Action
of Covenant against the said Roger Beckwith; and assigned the Breach in this,
That the said Roger was not seized of the said Rectory. And Note, That the
Plaintiff declared of an Indenture bearing date at the Castle of York; And upon
the breach of the Covenant, they were at Issue; which was found for the
Plaintiff, and damages assessed, and Judgment given for the Plaintiff. And
Note, That the Venire facias was, de Vicineto Castri de York. And upon that
Judgment, a Writ of Error was brought in the Exchequer upon the new Statute;
and Error was assigned, because all the Covenanters ought to have joined in the
Action of Covenant, notwithstanding those words, cum quolibet, and cum
qualibet; which words do not make the Covenant to be several: And for that
cause, the Judgment was Reversed. Another Error was assigned, because the Issue
is not well and duly tried; For the Issue is upon the seisin of the Rectory of
Aldingfleet; in which case, the Venire facias ought to have been de Vicineto de
Aldingfleet. And of that Opinion was Manwood and Anderson, Justices.

CCX. Young and Ashburnsham's Case. Hill. 29 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
IN an Action of Debt brought by the Administrators of Young against
Ashburnham; The Defendant pleaded, Nihil debet: And the Enquest was taken by
default. And upon the Evidence given for the Plaintiff, the Case appeared to be
this, That the said Young was an Innholder in a great Town in the County of
Sussex where the Sessions used to be holden; And that the Defendant was a
Gentleman of Quality in the Country there; And he, in going to the Sessions,
used to lodge in the house of the said Young, and there took his lodging and
his diet for himself, his servants, and horses: Upon which, the Debt in demand
grew: but the said Young was not at any price in certain with the Defendant,
nor was there ever any agreement made betwixt them for the same. It was said by
Anderson, Chief Justice, That upon that matter, an Action of Debt did not lie.
And therefore afterward, the Jury gave a Verdict for the Defendant.

CCXI. Heidon and Ibgrave's Case. Hill. 29 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
1 And. 148.
A Writ of Right was brought by Heidon against Ibgrave; and he demanded the
third part of 40 Acres of Land in the County of Hertford; and they were at
Issue upon the mere Right. Upon which the Grand Assise appeared; And first the
4 Knights were specially sworn, to say upon their Oath, Whether the Tenant has
better right to hold the Land, than the Demandant to demand it. And afterward,
the rest of the Jurors were sworn generally, as in other Actions. And there was
some doubt made, Whether the Demandant or the Tenant should first begin to give
Evidence? And at the last, it was Ruled by the Court, That the Tenant should
begin, because he is in the affirmative. And it was said by Periam, Justice,
That so it was late adjudged in the Case betwixt Noell and Watts; And upon the
Evidence, the Case was, That King Hen. the 8th by his Letters Patents gave to
the Demandant the Manor of New-Hall, and all the Lands in the Tenure and
Occupation of John Whitton, before demised to Johnson, and in the Parish of
Watford; And the truth was, That the said 40 Acres, whereof now the third part
was in demand, were in the Occupation of the said John Whitton, but were never
demised to Johnson, nor in the Parish of Watford: And by the clear Opinion of
the Court, the said 40 Acres did not pass; for the circumstances of the Deed
are not true, scil. the Demise to Johnson, and the being in the Parish of
Watford; but both were false. But if the said Land had had an especial name in
the Letters Patents, then it had been well enough, notwithstanding the
misprision in the rest. And by Anderson, If upon the particular it had
appeared, that the Demandant had paid his Money for the said 40 Acres,
peradventure they had passed.

CCXII. The Dean of Gloucester's Case. Hill. 29 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
THe Dean and Chapter of Gloucester brough a Writ of Partition, against the
Bishop of Gloucester, upon the Statute of 32 H. 8. of Partition: And it was
moved, That upon the words of the Statute, that the Action did not lie in this
Case; for, the Statute does not extend but to Estates in Ioynt-Tenancy, or in
Common of Lands whereof such Ioynt-Tenants or Tenants in Common are seized in
their own right. And also it is further said, That every such Ioynt-Tenant, or
Tenant in Common, and their Heirs, shall have Aid to deraign the warranty;
without speaking of the word, Successors. And by Periam and Windham, Justices,
The Writ does not lie. But Anderson seemed to be of a contrary Opinion.

CCXIII. Hare and Meller's Case. Hill. 29 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
HUgh Hare of the Inner Temple brought an Action upon the Case against Philip
Meller, and declared, Ante 138.
That the said Defendant had exhibited to the Queen a scandalous Bill against
the Plaintiff, charging the said Hugh to have recovered against the said
Defendant 400 l. by Forgery, Perjury, and Forswearing and Cosenage; And also
that he had published the matter of the said Bill at Westminster. etc. It was said by
the Court, That the exhibiting of the Bill to the Queen, is not in it self any
cause of Action; for the Queen is the Head and Fountain of Justice, and
therefore it is lawful for all her Subjects to resort to her to make their
complaints. But if a Subject after the Bill once exhibited, will divulge the
matter comprised in it, to the disgrace and discredit of the person intended;
the same is a good cause of Action. And so was the Case of Sir John Conway, who
upon such matter did recover. And as to the words themselves, It seems to the
Court, That they are not Actionable; For it is not expressly showed, That the
Plaintiff had used Perjury, Forgery, etc. And it may be, that the Attorney, or
Solicitor in the Cause, has used such indirect means, the Plaintiff not
knowing it; and in such case the Plaintiff has recovered by Forgery, etc. and
yet without reproach: And by perjury he could not recover, for he could not be
sworn in his own Cause. And Stanhops Case was remembered by the Court; which
was, That Edward Stanhop of Gray's Inn brought an Action upon the Case against
one who had Reported, That the said Edward Stanhop had gained his Living by
swearing and forswearing; And by the Opinion of the Court, The Action did not
lie; for those words do not set forth any actual forswearing in the person of
the Plaintiff; but it might be in an Action depending between the Plaintiff and
a stranger, that another stranger produced as a Witness had made a false Oath,
without any procurement or practice of the Plaintiff; in which Case, it might
be, that the Plaintiff had gained by such swearing.

CCXIV. Cheverton's Case. Hill. 29 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
HEnry Cheverton brought a Quare Impedit, and Counted, That he was seized of
the moiety of the Church of D. that is to say, To present qualibet prima vice;
and that J.S. is seized of the other moiety; that is to say, To present
qualibet secunda vice, etc. And Exception was taken to the Count, Because it
was not showed how the special Interest did begin; scil. by Prescription,
Composition, or otherwise; for it is clearly against common Right, and
therefore that ought to be showed. See Dyer, 13 Eliz. 229.

CCXV. Edmond's Case. Mich. 29 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
IN an Action upon the Case against Edmonds, the Case was, That the Defendant
being within age, requested the Plaintiff to be bounden for him to another, for
the payment of 30 l. which he was to borrow for his own use; to which the
Plaintiff agreed, and was bounden, ut supra, Afterward, the Plaintiff was sued
for the said Debt, and paid it; And afterward, when the Defendant came of full
age, the Plaintiff put him in mind of the matter aforesaid, and prayed him that
he might not be damnified so to pay 30 l. it being the Defendant's Debt:
Whereupon the Defendant promised to pay the Debt again to the Plaintiff: Upon
which promise, the Action was brought. And it was holden by the Court, That
although here was no present consideration upon which the Assumpsit could
arise; yet the Court was clear, That upon the whole matter the Action did lie,
and Judgment was given for the Plaintiff.

CCXVI. Farrington and Fleetwood.'s Case. Mich. 29 Eliz. In the Exchequer.
BEtween Farrington and Fleetwood, the Case was, upon the Stat. of 31 H. 8. of
Monasteries, 2 Len. 55. 1 Len. 333.
The Abbot and Covent of D. 29 H. 8. makes a Lease of certain Lands for 3
Lives, to begin after the death of one J.S. if they shall so long live: And
afterward, 30 H. 8. within a year before the Dissolution, they make another
Lease to JS. If the first Lease in the life of J.S. be such an Estate and
Interest, which by virtue of the said Statute shall make the second Lease void,
was the Question; For it was not in esse, but a future Interest.

Manwood, All the reason which has been made for the second Lease is, because
the first Lease is but a possibility; for J.S. by possibility may survive all
the 3 Lives, and so it shall never take effect: But notwithstanding, be it a
possibility, etc. or otherwise, It is such a thing as may be granted or
forfeited, and that during the life of the said J.S. And Note also the words of
the Statute, If any Abbot, etc. within one year next before the first day of
the Parliament, has made, or hereafter shall make any Lease or Grant for
years, life, or lives of any Manors, etc. whereof and in which any Estate or
Interest for life or years at the time of the making of any such Lease or
Grant, then had his being or continuance, or hereafter shall have his being or
continuance, and then was not determined, etc. shall be void, etc. And here is
an Interest, and that not determined at the time of the making of this Lease to
J.S. And of that Opinion was the whole Court, and all the Barons, and diverse
other of the Justices; And therefore a Decree was made against that Lease, etc.

CCXVII. The Master and Chaplains of the Savoy's Case. Mich. 29 Eliz. In the
Exchequer.
THe Master and Chaplains of the Savoy aliened a parcel of their possessions
unto another in Fee, and afterward surrendered their Patents, and a Vacat is
made of the Enrollment of them: It was now moved, How the Alienee should be
adjudged to make title to the said Lands, claiming the same by the Letters
Patents; For the Clerks would not make a Constat of it. For the Patents were
cancelled, and a Vacat made of the Enrolment. And the Case of Sir Robert Sidney
was vouched; in which Case, the Statute of 3 E. 6. was so expounded upon great
advise taken by the Lord Chancellor; who thereupon commanded, That no Constat
be made in such case.

Manwood, If Tenant in tail by Letters Patents of the King, surrendreth his
Patent, and cancelleth it, and a Vacat be made of the Enrollment, by that the
Issue in tail shall be bound; For no other person at the time of the cancelling
has Interest: But in the Case at Bar, a third person, scil. the Alienee has
an Interest; And therefore he was of Opinion, That he should have a Constat,
etc.

CCXVIII. Inchely and Robinson's Case. Hill. 29 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
IN an Ejectione Firmae, It was found by Verdict, That King E. 6. was seized of
the Manor and Hundred of Fremmington; 2 Len. 41. Owen Rep. 88.
and granted the same by his Letters Patents to one Barnard in Fee, rendering
130 l. per annum, and also to be holden by Homage and Fealty; And afterward
Queen Mary reciting the said Grant by King Ed. 6. and the Reservation upon it,
granted unto Gertrude Marchioness of Exeter, the Manor of Fremmington, and the
said Rent and Services, and also the Manor of Camfield, and other Lands and
Tenements, Tenendum per vicesimam partem unius feodi Militis; Gertrude being so
seized, Devised to the Lord Mountjoy the Manor of Fremmington, the Manor of
Camfield, etc. And also bequeathed diverse sums of Moneys to be levied of the
premises. And further found, that the said Rent of 130 l. was the full third
part of the yearly value of all the Lands and Tenements of the Devisor. The
Question was, If by these words of the Devise of the Manor of Fremmington, the
Rent and the Services pass; i.e. the Rent, Homage, and Fealty reserved upon the
Grant made by King Ed. 6. of the Manor and Hundred of Fremmington; And if the
said Rent and Services are issuing out of the Manor: For if the Rent does not
pass, then the same is descended to the Heir of the Marchioness; and then being
found the full third part of the value, the King is fully answered and
satisfied, and then the residue of the Inheritance discharged, and is settled
in the Devisee. And if the Rent does not pass, then is the Heir of the
Marchioness entitled by the Statute to a third of the whole, etc.

And Shuttleworth conceived, That if the Marchioness had Devised by express
words the said Rent and Services, they could not pass; For as to the Services,
they are things entire: as Homage and Fealty, they cannot pass by Devise in
case where Partition is to follow; for such things cannot receive any partition
or division, therefore not divideable: For the Statute enables the Proprietary
to give or devise two parts of his Inheritance in three parts to be divided: As
Catalla Felonum cannot be devised, for the reason aforesaid, Quod fuit
Concessum per totam Curiam. But as to the Rent, the Court was clear, That the
same was deviseable by the said Statute; and in respect of that, the mischief
of many distresses which the Common Law abhors, is dispensed with, and is now
become distrainable of common right. And as to the Devise, he argued much upon
the grounds of Devises; and put a ground put by Fineux, 15 H. 7. 12. Where
every Will ought to be construed and taken according as the words purport, or
as, it may be, intended, or employed by the words, What the intent of the
Devisor was: so as we ought to enquire the meaning of the Testator out of the
words of the Will. And see also a good Case, 19 H 8. 8 and 9. And he much
relied upon the Case of Bret and Rigden, Plow. Com. 343. See there the Case. So
in this Case, for as much as such Intent of the Devisor does not appear upon
the words of the Will, that this Rent shall pass; It shall not pass, for there
is not any mention of any Rent, in the whole Will. Fenner, argued to the
contrary; and he argued much upon the favorable Construction which the Law
gives to Wills. 14 H. 8. by Reversion, for remainder, and e contra. 17 E. 3. 8.
A Man may make a Feoffment in Fee of a Manor, by the name of a Knights Fee, a
multo fortiori, in the Cases of Devises: And in our Case, the Marchioness
conceived, That the Rent and Services reserved out of the Manor of
Fremmington, was the Manor of Fremmington, and that the Law would give
strength to that intent.

Walmesley conceived, That the Rent did not pass by the name of the Manor,
etc. for this Rent noc in veritate nec in reputatione was ever taken for a
Manor. Also the words, Of the Manor of Fremmington and Hundred, are put
amongst others which are Manors in truth. By which he conceived, That the
Devisor did not intend to pass but one Manor, and no other Herediatments, by
this Manor of Fremmington. There is a Rule in Law, That in the Construction of
a Will, a thing employed, shall not control a thing expressed: But here, If by
implication the Rent shall pass, then the Manor of Camfield is not passed,
which was the intent of the Testator to pass, and that by express words. See 16
Eliz. Dyer, 330. Clatches Case. No Implication of any Estate in remainder can
serve when a special Gift and Limitation is made by the Devisor himself. See
also, 16 Eliz. Dyer, 333. Chapman's Case. But in our Case here, there are not
sufficient words to warrant any Implication; for neither in truth, nor in
common reputation was it taken for a Manor. 27 H. 6. 2. Green-Acre may pass by
the name of a Manor, although it be but one Acre of Land, because it is known
by the name of a Manor. See acc. 22 H. 6. 39. And see, Where before the
Statute of Uses, A Man had recoverors to his use, and he wills by his Will,
That his Feoffees sell his Lands; they might sell. And he said, That if a Man
seized of a Manor, parcel in Demesne, and parcel in Service, and he grants
the Demesnes to one and his Heirs, and afterward devises his Manor,
peradventure the Services shall pass; but this Rent has not any resemblance to
a Manor.

Gaudy, This Rent shall pass by the name aforesaid. Favorable Construction is
always given in Wills, according to the meaning of the Devisor, and no part of
his Will shall be holden void, if by any means it may take effect; Then it here
appears, that his intent was, That upon these words, something should pass to
the Devisee concerning the Manor of Fremmington; for otherwise, the words, Of
the Manor of Fremmington, are void and frivolous; which shall not be in a
Will, if any reasonable Construction may be made; For it is found expressly by
the Jury, That neither at the time of the Will made, nor at the time of the
death of the Testator, the Devisor had any thing in the said Manor of
Fremmington, but the said Rent of 130 l. per annum. And it may well be taken,
That the Devisor being ignorant what thing a Manor is, thought that this Rent
was a Manor, because that she had Rents and Services out of the said Manor.
For in Construction of a Will, the words shall serve the intent; And therefore
if a Man Devises, That his Lands shall be sold for the payment of his Debts,
his Executors shall sell them; for the intent of the Devisor, names the sellers
sufficiently. And See Plowden, 20 Eliz. 524. L. after the Statute of 27 H. 8.
devises, that his Executors shall be seized to the use of A. and his Assigns
in Fee; whereas then there was no Feoffees to use: the same was holden a good
devise of the Land to A. But the Justices conceived, That the Devisor was
ignorant of the operation of the Statute in that case, and therefore his
ignorance was supplied. See Br. Devises, 48. 29 H. 8. A. had Feoffees to his
use; and afterward after the Statute of 27 H. 8. and 32 H. 8. he willed, That
his Feoffees should make an Estate to B. and his Heirs; It was holden by
Baldwin, Shelley, and Mountague, Justices, That it was a good Devise. And see,
26 H. 6. Fitz. tit. Feoffments and Faits, 12. A Carue of Land may pass by the
name of a Manor; therefore a fortiori a Rent; for Rents and Services have more
affinity, and more resemble a Manor, than a Carue of Land. And it cannot be
intended, that the meaning of the Testator was, to grant the Manor it self, in
which he had not any thing, especially by his Will; for Covin, Collusion or
indirect dealing, cannot be presumed in a Will. Also, The Marchioness for 4
years together before her death, had the Rent and Services of the said Manor;
and she well knew, that she her self had not any thing in the said Manor but
the said Rent and Services, and therefore it shall be intended, that the same
was her Manor of Fremmington. A. seized of a Capital Message, and great
Demesnes lying to it, Leased the same for years, rendering Rent, and afterward
devised to another all her Farm in such a place: And it was Ruled in that Case,
That by that Devise, the Rent and the Reversion passed. See the Case between
Wrottesley and Adams, Plow. 19. 1 Eliz. by Anthony Brown and Dyer.

Periam Justice, conceived, That this Rent might be divided well enough. But by
Anderson, It is but a Rent-Seck. Periam, It is distrainable of Common right;
Anderson doubted of it. But all the Justices agreed, That the Rent might be
divided; but there should not be two Tenures. The Lord Mountjoy being advised,
that this Rent did not pass, but descended to the Heir, being the full third
part of the Lands, entered into the Residue, and made a Lease of the Manor of
Camfield unto the Plaintiff; upon which the Ejectione firmae is brought: And
afterward, the Plaintiff seeing the Opinion of the Court to be against him,
and for the Devise of the Rent, for the reasons aforesaid Discontinued his
Suit, etc.

CCXIX. Williams and Drew's Case. Mich. 29 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
THe Widow of Williams who was Speaker of the Parliament, brought Dower against
Williams and Drew: upon the Grande Cape, Williams made default; And now came
Drew and surmised to the Court, That he is not Tenant of the Land: But further
he says, That the Husband of the Demandant Leased the said Lands to him for 50
years, and that this Action is brought by Covin to make him lose his Term; and
prayed to be received. And the Opinion of the whole Court, was, That although
he was party to the Writ, yet he should be received, and that by the Statute of
Gloucester, for he is in equal mischief. And the Court was also clear of
Opinion, That upon the default of Williams, the Demandant should not have
Judgment for a moiety, for that the Cause of the receipt trenched to the whole.
And by all the Justices, but Rhodes, If Judgment had been given upon the deault
of both, i. e. Williams and Drew, yet the Term of Drew should stand, but Drew
should be put out of possession, and put to his Action. And Anderson conceived,
That the Resceit upon that Statute did not lie, unless that Covin be alleged
betwixt the Demandant and the Tenant, to make him to lose his Term; and that
Covin is traversable: Which all the other Justices denied; for the Covin ought
to be averred, but ought not to be traversed. And also they all but Anderson,
were clear of Opinion, That in this Case of Receipt, the party shall not plead
upon his Receipt, as upon the Statute of Westminster; but he shall be received,
and have day to plead.

CCXX. Dicksey and Spencer's Case. Mich. 29 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
THe Case between Dicksey and Spencer, see H. 29 Eliz. Notwithstanding the
Opinion of the Court of Common Pleas, The Mayor and Aldermen of London reversed
the Judgment given in an Assise of Freshforce; Upon which, Dicksey sued a
Commission, directed to Anderson, Manwood, and Periam, to examine the said
Judgment, and ad errorem corrigendum. And the Case was often Argued; The
principal matter was, That Lessee for years in an Action of Debt brought
against him for the Rent reserved, claimed Fee by bargain and sale of his
Lessor; the which bargain and sale the Plaintiff traversed. And it was argued,
Because this bargain and sale was traversed, there was not any forfeiture in
the Case; for upon that, both parties are at large. As in a Praecipe quod
reddat, The Tenant disclaims, and the Demandant avers him Tenant, he shall not
enter for that Disclaimer. But all the three Justices were clear of Opinion,
That notwithstanding the Traverse, it is a forfeiture; for the very claim is a
forfeiture, which cannot be saved by matter subsequent. See 9 H. 5. 14. If
Tenant for life be impleaded in a Writ of Right, and joins the Mise upon the
mere Right, it is a forfeiture. Another Error was assigned, Because where it is
found, that both the Defendants Disseisiverunt the Plaintiff, but Spencer only
with force, and the Judgment in the Assise of Freshforce was, that ambo
Capiantur, where no force is found in Clark, one of them; yet such a Judgment
is good enough: For the Assise have found a Joint Disseisin, and that Clark was
present at the said Force; and then he particeps Criminis. And of that Opinion
were all the 3 Justices. And it way Objected, That forasmuch as Clark is
Convicted of force upon the matter, for both ought to be taken, therefore the
Damages ought to be trebled against both; And the Court was in some doubt of
that: But clearly, the Incrementum shall be trebled, as well as the Damages
taxed by the Assise; And after many Arguments, the said Justices moved the
parties to a friendly course, to compound the matter: For if we reverse the
Judgment given in the Hustings, Then Spencer may have his Writ of Error upon
the Judgment in the Assise of Freshforce, and sic infinite. And afterward, the
parties put themselves to the Mediation and Order of the said 3 Justices, who
at length made an end of the matter betwixt the said parties.

CCXXI. The Lady Newman and Shyriff's Case. Mich. 29 Eliz. In the Star Chamber.
4 Len. 25.
THe Lady Newman, Sister of James Wingfield lately deceased, Exhibited a Bill of
Complaint in the Star Chamber, against one Shyriff dwelling in Ireland, and two
others; setting forth, That the said Shyriff had forged a Deed, purporting,
That the said James had by the same given to him all his goods; and also that
the said James had assigned to the said Shyriff a Lease for years of Lands in
Ireland: And also that the said Shyriff had procured the said two other
Defendants to depose upon their Oath before the Town Clerk of London, That the
said Deed was sealed and delivered by the said James as his Deed. It was moved
by the Counsel of the Defendant's, That these matters of Forgery are not within
the Statute of 5 Eliz. nor also the Perjury, or the procurement of it:
Whereupon the Lords of the Council referred the Consideration of the said
Statute, to both the Chief Justices, who the next Court-day declared their
Opinions upon the said Matters; 1. That the said Statute did not extend to
forgery of a Deed conveying a gift of Chattels personals: Which see by the
Statute, which, as to that point, extends but to Obligations, Bills Obligatory,
Acquittance, Release, or other discharge. And also a Deed of an Assignment of a
Lease of Land in Ireland, is not within the said Statute. And also the said
Justices were of Opinion, That this Perjury, and the procurement of it, is not
punishable by the said Statute, because the Oath was taken Coram non Judice.
For the Town Clerk of London cannot minister an Oath in such case, no more than
a private person. But because the Bill in the perclose and Conclusion of it,
was contrary to the Laws and Statutes of this Realm, The said Chief Justices
were of Opinion, That the said Court might punish those offenses as
misdemeanors at the Common Law, but not according to the Statute. And
afterward Shyriff paid for a Fine 3 l. and by Order of the Court, was set in
the Pillory.

CCXXII. Middlemore's Case. Mich. 29 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
MIddlemore brought an Action upon the Case for these words; scil. Middlemore
is a Cosening Knave; for he had me to Coventry, and there cosened me of 40 s.
And afterward had Judgment to recover; And now the Defendant brought a Writ of
Error in the Exchequer-Chamber; and there the Opinion of the whole Court was,
That the said words were not actionable. And the Case of one Egerton was
remembered, Thou art a Cosening Knave Coroner, For thou have Cosened me of my
Land. The Plaintiff in that Case could not have Judgment; For he was not
particularly charged in respect of his Office. And Note; That in this Case of
Error, the Defendant pleaded an Outlawry in the Plaintiff; and being barred in
that, he pleaded now an Excommengement in the Plaintiff, and showed the Letters
of Excommunication: Upon which it appeared, That the Plea was pleaded before
the Outlawry was pleaded: And it was Ruled by the whole Court, That this Plea
lies not for the Defendant; For he cannot have two Pleas to the person of the
Plaintiff, but where his second Plea is matter of later time since the first
Plea: And afterward the said Judgment was reversed.

CCXXIII. Barns Executor of the Bishop of Durham and Smith's Case. Mich. 29
Eliz. In the Exchequer.
EManuel Barns, Executor of Barns late Bishop of Durham, 2 Len. 21.
brought Debt for Arrearages of Rent reserved upon a Lease for years of certain
Mines demised to Smith; scil. Mines called Argill, and Mines called Greenbourn;
and it was against the Executors of Smith. The Defendant pleaded, as to parcel,
Non detinet; and as to other parcel of the Arrears, That in the Indenture of
demise, there is a Covenant, Quod si contigerit, that the said Lessee impeditus
fuerit quominus Mineris praedict. gaudere possit, That then so much of Rent
should be deducted, amounting to the value of the Mines he could not enjoy,
etc. And pleads in facto quod impeditus fuit, quo minus gaudere potuit Mineris
praedictis, etc. And it was found for the Plaintiff. And it was moved by Cook
in arrest of Judgment, That here is not any place showed, where these Mines
were, so as Non constat from what place the Visne shall come: As if in an
Action (as here) the Plaintiff Declares of a Lease made of Land called R. in
such a County, the same is not good, Causa qua supra. The Issue here is Non
potuit fodere in praedicta Minera de Greenbourn, by the space of 7 years and a
half. From whence shall the Visne come for the trial of this? Not from Durham
where the Lease was made, for there is no nearness between the place where the
Lease was made, and this Issue: But if the Issue had been, That the Lessor had
not any thing in the Mines tempore dimissionis, it might have been tried where
the Lease was made.

Another Exception was taken, because the Plea is, Quod non potuit fodere in 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8. dimidio 10 and 11. and that appears to be 7 years and a half;
And the Jury find, Quod non potuit fodere per spatium 7 annorum tantum, without
speaking of the half year, and so they have not given a full Verdict.

As to the first Exception, It was said by Cook, If a thing be alleged in
pleading, which is Issuable, and there is not laid down any place of it,
although that no Issue be joined upon it; yet because he has prevented the
other of his Plea to it, Judgment given in such case shall be reversed: And so
it was Ruled between Matthew and Stransham. So upon the Statute of Usury, the
Informer charged the Defendant, For that by way of corrupt bargain, he had
received so much, and did not show the place, although that no Issue was joined
upon it, but they were at Issue upon another point; yet if Judgment in such
case be given, it shall be reversed.

And in all Actions upon the Case, where request is necessary, and the
Plaintiff ought to allege it, the place of the Request ought to be showed. And
he said, That this Issue ought to be tried where the Mines demised are, and
here no place is alleged where the Mines are, but only in Com. Dunelmens. and
yet a Visne of the City of Durham has tried this Issue, which ought not to be;
but the Visne should come de Corpore Comitatus.

Clark, Baron, If Issue be joined upon taking of the profits, it shall be tried
where the Land is, but non Debet or Detinet where the Lease was made: so, Ne
lessa pas.

By Cook, The Issue is, Non potuit fodere, and that is local, therefore it
shall be tried where the Mines are.

Manwood, Non potuit fodere, non potuit gaudere, are not local; but non fodit,
non gavisus fuit, is local, and shall be tried where the Mines are. And here it
is not showed, how he was hindered to dig, etc. and the Issue is, de potentia
and non de actu.

Tanfield, As to that which Cook has said, That the Visne in this Case shall
come de Corpore Comitatus; It is not so, for such Visne never shall be, but
where the Issue is, No such Town, Hamlet or place known. Tanfield, In another
Case, the Trial shall be de Corpore Comitatus; As in False Imprisonment, The
Defendant justifies, That the common voice and fame was, etc. there the Visne
shall be de Corpore Comitatus, 11 E. 4. 4 and 5. And see also, 21 Eliz. the
Case of Constantine and Gynne, (which see now Reported by the Lord Cook, in
Dowdell's Case) Cook 6. Part, 48. And as to the defect of the Verdict, upon the
half year, the Record is not so, for the Record is, Dimidio anni decimi, and
undecimi, and so two half-years, make one whole year, and so but 7 years in
which the disturbance is supposed to be done. And see as to the Visne de
Corpore Comitatus, 22 E. 4. 4. Fitz. Visne, 27.

Another Exception was taken, because the Declaration is, That the Lease was
made at Durham in Comitatu Dunelm. and does not say also in Setberg, for such
is the name of the County Palatine. But as to that it was said, Every Writ of
Execution which goes into the County Palatine, is directed Episcopo Dunelmens.
and Cancellario suo, Quod det in mandatis Vicecom. suo, etc. And Durham was
called Setberg in Ancient time, and the name of the County Palatine there is
commonly called Dunelm. and Setberg; and their Pleas there are entered, Placita
coram Justiciariis Dunelm. and Setberg, but the same is amongst themselves
only, and all directions from hence to them are, Episcopo Dunelm. without any
mention of Setberg; and a President was showed to the Court to such effect.

Manwood, Levied by Distress, and so nothing arrear, shall be tried where the
Lease is made.

Clark, That is true, For by the (So) the Plea before is waived. And see 8 H.
5. 10. Where an Issue is to be tried in Lincoln, etc. or such a Town which is a
Franchise, The Venire facias shall be of Lincoln, and not de Vicineto Lincoln;
for then the Jury should be as well of the County adjoining, as of Lincoln it
self; which the Visne of Lincoln cannot do: But Venire facias de Suburbiis of
Bristow, was awarded good.

And if in the Case at Bar, the Defendant had pleaded, That the Plaintiff had
entered into part of the Mines, and so suspended his Rent, upon which they are
at Issue, the some by Manwood, shall be tried by a Jury de Corpore Comitatus:
The Issue here is, If the Defendant might enjoy these Mines secundum veram
intentionem dimissionis praedict. and that is referred to the Demise which was
made at Durham, and therefore this Issue may be well tried there. And
afterward at another day, It was holden, That all the Issues are Jeofails. But
as to the want of the place, the same was holden a material Exception. See the
Case of Mines, Plow. Com. 337. Exception was taken to the Information, because
it was not laid down there, in what Town or Hamlet Newlands lay. And it was
holden, The same had been a material Exception, if the Defendant had not
demurred upon the Information; in which case, no Trial by Jury is to be, etc.
And he said, Misnosmer shall be tried, where the Writ is brought, etc. so never
administered as Executors, etc.

Manwood, Here the Lease is laid to be made at Durham in a place certain. If
then there be not any other local thing laid which may draw the Trial
elsewhere, it shall be tried at Durham where the Lease is made. An Enfant makes
a Lease for years, rendering Rent, and afterward reenters, and avoids his
Lease by reason of his Nonage, and title is found against him by that Lease,
upon which he pleads Nonage, it shall be tried where the Lease is made, etc.
And afterward, Judgment was given for the Plaintiff.

CCXXIV. Blunt and Ward's Case. Mich. 29 Eliz. In the Exchequer.
WHere an Order was made, That such a one should have the mean profits and
issues of such Lands; It was holden, The same is not to be intended, That the
party shall have the Crop which grows upon the Land by the manurance of
another, but the value of the Land as it might be Leased. And so it is where
the Sheriff retorns Issues, etc. for the Corn there growing may be of the value
of 40 l. where the Land is but of the value of 10 l.

CCXXV. Weshborn and Mordant's Case. Mich. 29 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
2 Len. 103. 1 Cro. 191.199. 1 Len. 247.
IN an Action upon the Case, the Plaintiff declared, That whereas he was
possessed of a piece of Land containing 2 Acres, called Parsonage, lying
adjoining to a certain River, from the 20th of May, 29 Eliz. usque diem
impetrationis istius Brevis, etc. the Defendant had the said 20th day of May
estopped the said River, with certain Loads of Earth, and so continued estopped
until the 14th of February, by reason of which his Land was drowned, and so he
had lost the profit of it for the said time. It was moved in Arrest of
Judgment, That upon the Declaration it does not appear, that there is any cause
of Action, for the Plaintiff has made title to the Land drowned from the 20th
day, so as that day is excluded, and the Nuisance is laid to be done the said
20th day: and if so, then he cannot complain of any wrong, the Nuisance being
laid to be before any possession of the Plaintiff. To which it was answered,
That although the stopping was made before the possession, yet the Continuance
of it after is a new wrong, for which an Action lies. As 5 H. 7. 4. It was
presented, That an Abbot had not cleansed his Ditch, etc. by reason of which,
the Highway is estopped, The Successor shall be put to Answer to that
Indictment by reason of the Continuance of it. See, that continuance of a
Nuisance, is Quasi a new Nuisance, 14 and 15 Eliz. Dyer, 320. And it may be, that
the Plaintiff was not damnified, until a long time after the 20th of May, scil.
after the Estopping; and the words of the Writ here are satisfied and true.
Afterward, Judgment was given for the Plaintiff.

CCXXVI. The Queen and Scot's Case. Mich. 29 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
THe Queen brought a Quare Impedit against the Bishop of London, and Scot; And
the Case was, 1 Len. 40.
A. seized of an Advowson in gross holden of the Queen in Chief, aliened the
same by Fine without License of the King: The Church became void; The Conusee
presented; the Queen without Office found brought a Quare Impedit: The Question
was, If the Queen without Office found, should present? It was agreed by the
whole Court, That if the alienation had been by Deed only, there the Queen
without Office should not have the presentment; For upon such alienation by
matter in fait without License, no Scire facias shall issue without Office
found of the alienation. But upon Alienation without License by matter of
Record, a Scire facias lies before Office. And in the last Case, the Queen
shall have the Issues from the time of the Scire facias returned; but in the
first Case, from the time of the Office found. See Stam. Prerogat. see 8 E 4.
4. It was then moved, That if the Queen, being entitled to present ut supra,
pardon the Conusee all alienations without License and Intrusions, If the
Estate of the Incumbent thereby be confirmed? But the Court would not argue
that Point.

CCXXVII. Sir Thomas Holland and Bonis's Case. Mich. 29 Eliz. In the Common
Pleas.
IN a Replevin, 1 Len. 183. 2 Len. 12. Owen Rep. 138, 139,
the Defendant made Conusans as Baily to Tho. Lord Howard, and showed, That the
Prioress of the late dissolved Priory of Hallywell was seized of the Manor of
Priors in the County of Hertford, and granted the same by words of Dedi and
concessi pro certa pecuniae summa to the Lord Audley, Chancellor of England,
and his Heirs, who died thereof seized; and that the said Manor (inter alia)
descended to Mary, Daughter and Heir of the said Tho. Lord Audley, who died
thereof seized; by force of which, the said Manor descended to the said Tho.
Lord Howard, etc. And showed, That the Conveyance by the Prioress bore date, 4.
November. 29 H. 8. and then enrolled in the Chancery. The Plaintiff in bar of the
said Conusans, showed, That after the making and inrolling of the said
Conveyance, the said Prioress Leased the Lands to Sir Hen. Parker for 99 years,
and conveyed the said Lands to himself; and further showed, That the said
Conveyance specified in the Conusans, fuit primo deliberatum 4. November, 31 H.
8. without that, that the said Prioress, the said 4. November. 29 H. 8. dedit and
concessit, the said Manor to the said Lord Audley. Upon which it was demurred.
And it was the clear Opinion of the Court, That the Averment de primo
deliberatum against a Deed enrolled, ought not to be received. For by the same
reason, it might be averred, Nunquam deliberatum; and so upon the matter, Non
est factum.

It was further Objected, That a Bargain and Sale by a Corporation is not good;
For a Corporation cannot be seized to another's use; and the nature of such a
Conveyance is to take effect by way of use in the bargain, and afterward the
Statute draws the possession to the use: But the Court utterly rejected the
said Exception as dangerous, for that such were the Conveyances of the greater
part of the possessions of Monasteries. And it was in this Case said by
Shuttleworth, Sergeant, That although such a Corporation could not take an
Estate to another's use; yet they might charge their own possessions with an
use to another.

CCXXVIII. The Queen and the Bishop of Gloucester's Case. Trin. 29 Eliz. In the
Kings Bench.
THe Queen recovered in a Quare Impedit against the Bishop of Gloucester, and
one S. in which Quare Impedit, the Bishop pleaded as Ordinary; scil. Quod ipse
nihil habet nec habere clamat in Ecclesia praedict. neq, in Advocatione ejusdem
nisi Admissionem, Institutionem, etc. And now the Bishop and S. the Incumbent
brought a Writ of Error; And, If this Writ of Error brought jointly by the
Bishop and the Incumbent, was well brought, was the Question? Some held, That
the Bishop had not cause to bring Error, for that he had disclaimed in the
Church, and the Patronage of it: For if in a Praecipe quod reddat the Tenant
disclaims, he shall never have a Writ of Error. 16 E. 3. 7. Fitz. Error, 78.
And Note, That in the Writ of Error at the Bar, the perclose was, Ad grave
damnum Episcopi; whereas the Bishop could not be grieved by the said Judgment,
because he had nothing, nor claimed any thing in the Church, etc.

Wray, The Writ of Error had been the better, if those words, (ad grave damnum
Episcopi) had been left out, for the Bishop has lost nothing.

And it was Objected by some, If the Judgment in this Case be reversed, the
usual Judgment cannot be given; scil. That the Bishop shall be restored to all
which he lost, etc.

Wray, The Bishop shall join for Conformity of Law, and for privity of Record;
and the Plea of the Bishop is not so strong as a Disclaymer: For in case of a
Disclaimer, the Judgment is, That the Plaintiff shall take nothing by his Writ;
but in the case of the Bishop here, the Judgment is, Quod querens recuperet
praesentationem suam versus dictum Episcopum ad Ecclesiam praedictam. See 35 H.
6. 4. Fitz. Error, 35. And afterward in the principal Case, the Writ of Error
was awarded good.

CCXXIX. Williams and Linford's Case. Trin. 29 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
EDward Williams brought an Action upon the Case against Linford, 2 Len. 111.
for slanderous words concerning the Title of the Plaintiff's Lands; viz.
Williams is nothing worth; and do you think that the Manor of D. is his? It is
but a Compact betwixt his Brother Thomas and him. And declared further, That at
the time of the speaking of these words, there was a Communication with one
J.S. to give the said J.S. the said Manor of D. for his Manor of R. and that
by reason of the said slanderous words, 1 Cro. 346.787.
the said J.S. durst not proceed in the said intended exchange. It was
Objected, That upon this matter, an Action upon the Case did not lie, because
the slanderous words were not spoken to him who should be purchasor of the
Lands, but unto a stranger: For in the Case betwixt Smith and Johnson; Johnson
was in speech with one to sell his Land to him, and Smith said to him who
should be the purchasor of them, Will you buy Johnson's Land, Why, it is
troubled with more Charges and Encumbrances then it is worth?

Wray, There is not any difference, be the words spoken to the parties, or unto
a stranger; for in both Cases, the Title of the Plaintiff is slandered, so as
he cannot make sale of it. It was adjudged for the Plaintiff.

CCXXX. Mich. 29 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
A Poor Woman brought an Action of Trespass for breaking of her Close, and
declared of a Continuance by 6 years: And upon Nihil dicit, had Judgment to
recover: Upon which a Writ of Enquiry of Damages issued forth; and now came the
Woman and showed to the Court, That the Jury had found too little Damages;
scil. but 40 s. whereas the Land was worth 5 l. per annum, and that the
Trespass had been continued for 6 years; and prayed, that the said Writ might
not be received, and that the Court would award another Writ to have a better
Enquiry of the Damages. But the whole Court denied it; For so there might be
infinite Enquiries.

But some time at the request of the Defendant, when excessive Damages are
found, or any misdemeanour is alleged in the Plaintiff, in procuring, or using
such a Writ of Enquiry of Damages, We use to relieve the Defendant with a new
Writ, but never the Plaintiff, because it is his own Act.

And by Rhodes, The late Countess of Darby brough a Writ of Dower, and had
Judgment to recover; and she surmised, That her Husband died seized, and prayed
a Writ of Enquiry of Damages, and had it: And because too small Damages were
found, she would have suppressed the said Writ, and procured another; but she
could not have it. And at the last, she was driven to bring in the said Writ.
Which she did accordingly.

CCXXXI. Lawson and Hare's Case. Mich. 29 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
2 Len. 74.
IN a Replevin by Lawson against Hare of the Temple, who Avowed, because he
himself was seized of a Hundred; And that he himself, and all those whose
Estate he has in the said Hundred, have used to hold a Leet within the said
Hundred at such a place every year; And that at every time such Leet should be
holden, The Inhabitants within the said Precinct have used to pay to the Lord
of the Leet, 16 d. for the Leet-Fee; and that they have used to distrain for
the same: And showed, That at a Leet there holden 5 July, 26 Eliz. etc. The
Plaintiff replied, absque hoc, that they used to distrain; And it was found for
the Defendant. And it was moved in arrest of Judgment, Because the Defendant in
making his Title to the Leet by Prescription, Conveys the Hundred to him by a
Que Estate, without showing a Deed of it. See 11 H. 4. 242. Quod fuit concessum
per Anderson and Windham. Periam and Rhodes, contrary; But if the Hundred it
self had been in Question, then the Exception had been material, but here the
Defendant intitles himself to a thing by reason of the Hundred, and then it is
sufficient for him to say, That he is seized of the Hundred, be it by right, or
by wrong. Admit, That by this not showing, the Avowry be vicious and defective,
It is to be considered, if it be not helped by the Statute of Jeofail's, 1 Cro.
217.245.
18 Eliz. And therefore it is to be considered, If an Avowry be within the
meaning of the said Statute.

Anderson, Although that the Avowant be quasi an Actor to have a Retorn of the
Cattle, if the Distress be adjudged lawful; yet in truth he is Defendant, and
not Plaintiff; And if the Defendant will justify the taking, and not avow, he
is merely Defendant: And although that he avow to have a Retorn, yet he cannot
be said Plaintiff, no more than the Tenant who voucheth over another to recover
in value, may be said Plaintiff. And therefore an Avowry cannot be said a
Count, or Declaration, but a Answer to the Count, or Declaration.

Windham and Periam conceived, That an Avowry is within the Statute; For it
comprehends title: And an Answer to an Avowry, is said a Bar to an Avowry; and
an Avowry is in the place of a Declaration. Admitting, That an Avowry is within
the Statute; If the not showing of the Deed be such a defect which may be
helped by the Statute.

Anderson conceived, That it was: But the Plaintiff might have demurred upon
the Avowry, for not showing of the Deed, and have had judgment. But when he
has traversed the Prescription as to the point of the distress, and the same
is found against him, Now it shall be intended that the Avowant has a Deed,
although he has not showed it.

Windham, The Title of the Avowant to the Hundred, is the Foundation and ground
of the Suit; for if the Avowant has not a Deed to make him a sufficient title
to the Hundred, he cannot have the Leet: and if no Leet, then no Leet-Fee; and
then the Avowant has no cause to distrain.

Another Exception was taken to the Avowry, because the Avowant has not showed
any Seisin of the Leet-Fee.

And by Periam, Such a seisin ought to be showed in some person certain. For
although it needs not always to lay a Seisin, in showing by whose hands the
seisin was had, (for the Inhabitants are charged, and no person certain) yet
the seisin ought to be laid in a person in such sort as it may be laid: and
therefore in this Case, forasmuch as the seisin cannot be showed by the hands
of the Inhabitants, it ought to be laid in the Lord. See 4 H. 6. 29. Br.
Avowry, 71. In a Recordare the Defendant avowed, because the King is seized of
the Castle of C. in jure Ducatus sui Cornub. to which he had 20 s. Rent out of
the Town of D. Solvend. annuatim at Michaelmas, of which Rent, the King and all
the Dukes of Cornwall aforesaid had been seized time out of memory, etc. by the
hands of the Inhabitants of the same Town, etc. and the same was holden a good
Avowry. For although that seisin ought to be laid in some person certain by his
hands; yet in that case it is good enough; For the seisin by one of the
Inhabitants, is the seisin of them all.

And in the principal Case by Periam and Walmesley, It was agreed, That the
seisin here was well enough confessed; For when the Plaintiff has taken Issue,
That they have used to distrain, all other matters are holden confessed,
because that the Plaintiff has not saved them to him by protestation. Which
Rhodes granted.

Another Exception was taken to the Avowry, because that the Leet by it is
supposed to be holden in July; therefore void: which see, Magna Charta, 35.

But it was holden by Anderson, Windham, and Rhodes, That by reason of this
Prescription, the Court is well holden in July, notwithstanding the said
Statute of Magna Charta, and it might be holden at what day he pleased; For his
Liberty and Election is not restrained by the said Statute, and such is the
common experience. And note the words of the same Statute, Ita quod quilibet
habeat Libertates suas quas habuit, vel habere consuevit, tempore Regis H. avi
nostri, etc. vel quod postea perquisivit, etc.

And Rhodes conceived, That the said Statute is to be intended of Turns only,
and not of Leets. Which see, 24 H. 8. Br. Leet, 23. in the end of the Case.

But by Periam, A Leet cannot be holden but according to the said Statute, for
to that purpose was the said Statute made: But if a Leet has been time out of
mind, etc. holden at any other day than that which is limited by the Statute,
it is a good prescription, and it is saved by the Statute. The Prescription is,
That he and all. etc. have used to hold a Leet once in a year, and has not
showed when the said year begins; for it may be, that a Leet has been holden
there in this year before July, and then this is a void Leet, and so no
Leet-Fee due; and of that Opinion was Periam, viz. That the Avowant ought to
have showed the beginning and end of the year, viz. That he held the said Leet
pro uno anno finito, such a day: for it may be he has holden two Leets in one
year: But it was said by the other Justices, That that shall come on the other
side; for prima facie it shall be intended that it has been but once holden in
the same year, until the contrary be showed.

And Note, by Anderson and Rhodes, If the King grants to one a Leet to hold
semel quolibet anno, without saying, At the Liberty of the Grantee, the Grant
is good, and the Grantee may hold it at what day he pleases.

CCXXXII. Putnam and Cook's Case. Mich. 29 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
2 Len. 129.193. 1 Cro. 52.
IN Ejectione Firmae, It was found, That one Hawkins was seized of 3 Messuages
in Bury in Fee, and had Issue Robert his Son, and Christien and Joan,
Daughters; And Devised all his said Messuages to his Wife for life, the
remainder of one of the said Messuages to his Son Robert and his Heirs; the
remainder of another of his said Messuages to his Daughter Christien and her
Heirs; the remainder of the third to Joan and her Heirs; And further willed,
That if any of his said Issues died without Issue of his body, that then the
other surviving should have totam illam partem, etc. between them equally to be
divided. The Devisor died; The Wife of the Devisor died; Joan died having
Issue; Robert died without Issue; Christien entered into the whole Message of
Robert, and died; and her Husband held in as Tenant by the Courtesy.

Cook, The surviving Child shall have the whole, and the Issue of Joan shall
have nothing. And he conceived, That by this Devise they have an Estate in
tail; for the Fee is not vested in them, for that it is uncertain which of them
shall survive: but when one does survive, then he shall have the Fee; for these
words, totam illam partem, go to the whole Estate, as well as to the whole
Land. If I Devise my whole Land to J.S. he has a Fee. And he conceived, That
the three had an Estate in tail with a Fee expectant, each severally to the
House limited to him.

Golding, contrary; Each of them has an Estate tail in the House Devised to
him, and but an Estate for life expectant upon the death of the other without
Issue; for there are no words by which it might appear what Estate they shall
have by the Survivor, etc. I grant the Case which Perkins denies, but Littleton
affirms; scil. A Devise of Lands to one in perpetuum; for there the intent
appears: but where there are not words of Inheritance, nor words amounting to
so much, then it shall be but an Estate for life; And as to these words, totam
illam partem, the same is all one, as if he had Devised, totam illam, without
partem. Also he conceived, That where one only survived, no estate further
vested, for there ought to be two to take by the Survivorship; for the words
are, aequaliter inter eos dividend. And then if it cannot accrue by Survivor,
then it shall descend: And if it had accrued by Survivor, they should thereof
have been Tenants in Common, and not Ioynt-Tenants, by reason of these words,
aequaliter dividend.

Clench, Justice, The words, totam illam partam, go to the House, and not to
the Estate in it.

Shute, to the same intent, If both the Daughters had survived; they should
have Fee in the House of Robert, but not by the Will; but by descent in
Coparcenery. Also when two are dead, the Son and one Daughter, then it cannot
be decided; therefore the Will as to that is void, and then the Common Law
shall take place, and put the Message to the Issue of one Daughter, as to the
Sister surviving.

Gaudy, Justice, Here is but an Estate for life in the survivor, It has been
Objected, That then being but an Estate for life, that Estate is drowned by the
descent of the Feesimple, so as now the Estate limited by the Will, is void. To
which it may be answered, That although now upon the matter it be void, yet ab
inition, it was not so, for it became void by matter of later time; scil. by
the descent of the Feesimple; For if one of the Daughters had died without
Issue before the death of Robert, so as the House of such Daughter had come to
Robert and the other Sister; there had been no Coparcener, for the Son had all
the Fee, and the moiety of it is executed, and the moiety expectant, and the
Sister has the moiety for life; and then the Devise is not good. Also here are
two survivors, so as nothing is to be divided, and therefore the Law shall say,
That the House of Robert is descended, scil. the Fee of it to the Daughter of
Christien and Joan. And so Judgment was given against the Husband, who claimed
to be Tenant by the Courtesy of the whole Land and Message.

CCXXXIII. Large's Case. Mich. 29 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
2 Len. 82.
IN an Action upon the Case, the Case was this; A. seized of Lands in Fee,
Devised the same to his Wife, till William his younger Son should come to the
age of 22 years, the remainder when the said William should come to such age,
of his Lands in D. to his two Sons Alexander and John, the remainder of his
Lands in C. to two other of his Sons, upon Condition, Quod si aliquis dictorum
filiorum suorum circumibit vendere terram suam before his said Son William
should attain his said age of 22 years imperpetuum perderet eam. And before
such age, two of his Sons Leased their parts which accrued to them by the Will
of their Father for 60 years; and so from 60 years to 60 years, till 240 years
were expired: It was Argued by Bois, That Alexander and John are Ioynt-Tenants,
and not Tenants in Common; notwithstanding the Opinion of Audley, 30 H. 8. Br.
Devises, 29. And he argued also, That the said Leases from 60 years to 60
years, is not within the Condition of the Devise, for it is not a sale from
which they only are restrained: and so is it of a Ioynture made by any of the
Sons to their Wives.

On the contrary, It was argued, because this remainder does not vest
presently, for it is uncertain if it shall vest or not; For if William should
die before he came to the age aforesaid, it was conceived, that the remainder
was void. 34. E. 3. Fitz. Formedon, 68. A Man devises Land to his Wife for
life, so that if the said Wife be disturbed, that the Land shall remain over in
Fee; scil. to D. here is not any remainder until the Wife be disturbed. So a
Devise unto a Woman so long as she shall remain sole; and that then it shall
remain to B. here this remainder shall not begin till the marriage: And this
Condition of restraint of Alienation is good, for he is not altogether
restrained, but for a time, scil. until his Son shall come to the age of 22
years: As a Feoffment upon Condition, That he shall not alien to J.S. See 29 H.
8. Br. Mortmain, 39. A Lease made for 100 years, and so from 100 years, to 100
years, until 800 years be expired, is Mortmain. And see the Statute de
Religiosis, The words are, emere praesumat, and vendere. A Lease for years is
within such words, emere, and vendere. Also, by this Lease, the Will is
defrauded; and where the Statute of Gloucester, Cap. 3. Wills, That if a Man
aliens Tenements which he holds by the Law of England, with warranty, the Son
shall not be barred; and yet if Tenant by the Courtesy be disseised, to whom he
releaseth with warranty, the same is within the said Statute: and yet a Release
and an Alienation are not the same, because they are in the like mischief; and
if the Sons might make a Lease for 240 years, they might make a Lease for 2000
years. So if the Sons had acknowledged a Statute of such a sum as amounted to
the value of the Land, it had been within the Condition. It was holden, That
where the words are, Circumibit vendere terram imperpetuum perdert, this word
imperpetuum, should be referred to perdere, and not to vendere.

Fenner, This Lease is not within the word (Sell;) For if the Custom be, That
an Enfant of the age of 15 years may sell his Land; yet by that he cannot
devise it.

Note: That afterward the words of the Condition set down in the Will in
English, were read, viz. Shall go about to sell his part, shall for ever lose
the same. And then it is clear, that this word imperpetuum, shall be referred
in Construction to perdere, and not to vendere; for this word (Shall) is
inserted betwixt both.

CCXXXIV. Mich. 29 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
IN a Formedon, The Tenant pleaded a Fine with proclamations: The Demandant
replied, Null tiel Record; And the truth of the Case was, That the Record of the
Fine which remained with the Chirographer did warrant the Plea; but that which
remained with the Custos Brevium did not warrant it; and both these Records
were showed to the Court.

And Rhodes, Justice, cited a President, 26 Eliz. Where, by the advice of all
the Justices of England, where such Records differ; the Record remaining with
the Custos Brevium was amended, and made according to the Record remaining with
the Chirographer. Which Windham concessit.

And afterward, the said President was showed, in which was set down all the
proceedings in the amending of it, and the names of all the Justices, by whose
direction the Record was amended, were set down in it; And that the said
President was written, and the amendment of the said Record recorded, by the
Commandment and appointment of the said Justices in perpetuam rei memoriam.

And the reason which induced the said Justices to make such Order, is here
written, because they took it, That the Note remaining with the Chirographer,
est principale Recordum.

CCXXXV. Sir Gervase Clifton's Case. Mich. 29 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
4 Len. 199.
IN a Quo Warranto against Sir Gervase Clifton, It was showed, That the said Sir
Gervase was seized of a Manor, and of a House, in which he claimed to have a
Court, with View of Frank-Pledge; and that he without any Grant or other
authority usurpavit Libertates praedictas. The Defendant pleaded, Quod non
usurpavit Libertates praedictas infra Messuagium praedict. modo and forma. And
upon that, there was a Demurrer in Law; For the Defendant ought to have said,
Non usurpavit Libertates praedictas, nec eorum aliquam; for he ought to answer,
singulatim: And also he ought to have pleaded as well to the Manor, as to the
House; For if the Defendant has holden Court within any place within the
Manor, it is sufficient. See 33 H. 8. Br. Franc. sans ceo, 364. An Information
was in the Exchequer, That the Defendant had bought Wool of A.B. contra
Statutum. The Defendant pleaded, That he had not bought of A. and B. The Plea
was not allowed; but he shall plead, That he had not bought modo and forma: For
if he has bought of A.B. or J.S. the same is not material nor traversable.
Which Case, Cook denied to be Law. And he also conceived, That the Information
upon the Quo Warranto, is not sufficient; For by the same, the Defendant is
charged to hold a Court, and it is not showed what Court; For it may be a Court
of Pipowders, Turn, etc. See 10 E. 4. 15 and 16. acc.

Shute, Justice, The Quo Warranto contains two things in it self; 1. A Claim.
And, 2. An usurpation; and here, the Defendant has answered but to the
Usurpation, but says nothing to the Claim. And it has been holden in this
Court heretofore, That he ought to answer to both.

And he said, That it has been holden in a Reading upon the Statute of Quo
Warranto, which is supposed to be the Reading of Justice Frowick, That a Quo
Warranto does not lie upon such Liberties which do not lie in Claim; as Felons
goods, etc. which lies only in point of Charter.

CCXXXVI. Venable's Case. Mich. 29 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
THe Case was; 1 Inst. 351. a. Hughs Queries 13.
A Lease was made to A. and B. for their lives, the remainder to Tho. Venables
in tail; who 3 Eliz. was attainted of Felony: 23 Eliz. there was a General
Pardon. Tho. Venables, 24 Eliz. levied a Fine, and suffered a Recovery to the
use of Harris, Sergeant: Office is found, Harris traversed the Office; and
thereupon was a Demurrer: It was argued by Leake, That Traverse did not lie in
this Case; 4 H. 7. 7 Where the King is entitled by double matter of Record,
the party shall not be admitted to his Traverse, nor to his Monstrans de Droit,
but is put to his Petition. Which see, 3 E. 4. 23. in the Case of the Earl of
Northumberland; Where Tenant of the King is Attainted of Treason, and the same
is found by Office. See also 11 H. 4. in the Case of the Duke of Norfolk; And
the same is not helped by the Statute of 2 E. 6. Cap. 8. for the words are,
Untruly found by Office, but here the Office is true: By this Attainder, Tho.
Venables is utterly disabled to do any Act; For by Bracton, a Person attainted
forisfacit Patriam, Regnum, and Haereditatem suam, 13 E. 4. One was attainted
of Felony: And before Office found, the King granted over his Lands. Also he is
not helped by the General Pardon; For before the General Pardon, he had a
special Pardon; therefore the General Pardon nihil operatur as to him: But by
the Justices, the forfeiture does remain until the General Pardon.

Harris, to the contrary. And he put the Case of Sir James Ormond, 4 H. 7. 7.
Where the King is entitled by matter of Record, and the subject confesses the
title of the King, and avoids it by as high matter as that is for the King,
Traverse in that case lies: and if the King be entitled by double matter of
Record, if the party avoids one of the said Records by another Record, he shall
be admitted to his Traverse; And so here we have the Pardon which is a Record,
and that shall avoid the Record for the King: And here the Pardon has purged
the forfeiture in respect of the Offense. And he said, That Tenant in tail
being attainted of Felony, shall not lose his Lands, but the profits only, for
he has his Interest by the Will of the Donor, and it is a Confidence reposed
in him; and as Walsingham's Case is he cannot grant over his Estate. And see,
in Wroth's Case, Annuity granted pro Consilio impendendo, cannot be granted
over, or forfeited, for there is a Confidence. See Empson's Case, Dyer, 2. and,
29 Ass. 60. If the Issue in tail be Outlawed of Felony in the life of his
Father, and gets his Pardon in the life of his Father, after the death of his
Father he may enter. But by Thorp, If the Issue in tail gets his Pardon after
the death of his Father, then the King shall have the profits of the Lands
during the life of the Issue. And the Case of Cardinal Pool was debated in the
Parliament, 27 Eliz. That he being Dean of Exeter, was seized of Lands in the
right of his Church, and was attainted of Treason. It was holden, he should
forfeit the profits of such Lands. But admit, That by this Attainder, the Land
be forfeited; yet the party has the Freehold until Office found. See Nicholls
Case, Plow. Com. And also the Case of the Duchy, in Plow. Com. acc. And here,
the Pardon has dispensed with the forfeiture. A Tenant of the King aliens in
Mortmain before Office found, the King pardons it, it is good. The Lord
Poynings conveyed all his Lands to Sir Adrian Poynings who was an Alien, and
after made a Denizen, and the King pardoned and released to him all his right
in the said Lands without any words of grant; and adjudged, the same did bind
the King: And he said, he had a good president, 14 H. 7. Where a General Pardon
before seizure into the hands of the King, was allowed good; contrary, after a
seizure without words of Grant. See Br. 29 H. 8. Br. Charter of Pardon, 52. If
a Man be attainted of Felony, and the King pardons him all Felonies and
executiones eorundem, and Outlawries, etc. and releases all forfeitures of
Lands and Tenements, and of Goods and Chattels, the same will not serve but for
life of Lands, if no Office be found, but it will not serve for the goods
without words of restitution and grant; for the King is entitled to them by
the Outlawry without office: But the King is not entitled to Land, until
Office be found. See Ibid. 33 H. 8. 71. The Heir intrudes, and before Office
found, the King pardons, now the Heir is discharged as well of the Issues and
profits, as of the Intrusion it self. But a Pardon given after the Office
found, is available for the Offense, but not for the Issues and profits. And he
cited the Case of Cole in Plowden, where a Pardon was granted, mean between the
stroke and the death. See 35 H. 6. 1. 16 E. 4. 1. 8 Eliz. Dyer, 249. Brereton's
Case. 11 Eliz. Dyer, 284, 285.

Egerton, Solicitor, contrary, This Traverse is not good, for he who
traverseth, has not made title to himself as he ought, upon which the Queen
may take Issue; for it is in the Election of the Queen to maintain her own
title, or to traverse the title of the party. At the Common Law, no Traverse
lay but where Livery might be sued; but that is helped by the Statute of 34 E.
3. but where the King is entitled by double matter of Record (as in our Case
he is) no Traverse was allowed until 2 E. 6. Cap. 8. And in such Case, two
things are requisite, 1. That the Office be untruly found. 2. That the party
who is to be admitted to his Traverse, have just title or Interest of Estate of
Freehold, etc. But in our Case, the Office is confessed by the Traverse to be
true, although that the conveyance be not truly found. And also Harris, at the
time of the Office found, had not just title, but his Interest came to him,
long time after the Office found. Also the traverse is not good, for he
traverseth the matter of the Conveyance, which is not traversable; For if the
Queen has title, non refert, quo modo, or by what Conveyance she has it. As
to the matter in Law, Tenant in tail in remainder is Attainted of Felony, If
the King during the life of the Tenant in tail, shall have the Freehold. And he
conceived, she should; For it shall not be in abeyance, and it cannot be in any
other; for when he is attainted, he is dead as unto the King: The chief Lord
cannot have it; For the Tenant for life is alive; and also he in the remainder
in Fee; etc. The Donor shall not have it, for the Tenant is not naturally dead,
but civilly; and the Land cannot revert before the Tenant in tail be naturally
dead without Issue. But if there were any other in whom the Freehold could
vest, then the King should not have the Freehold, but only the profits. So if
the Tenant be attainted, the Lord shall have the Land presently, 3 E. 3. 4 E.
3. The Husband seized in the right of his Wife, is attainted of Felony, the
King shall have but the profits, because that the Freehold rests in the Wife;
and if the Lord enters, the Wife shall have an Assise. And Tenant in tail may
forfeit for his life, as he may grant during his life. See Old N.B. 99. If
Tenant in tail for Life, Dower, or by the Courtesy, be attaint of Felony, the
King shall have the Land during their lives; and after their decease, he in the
Reversion shall sue to the King by Petition, and shall have the Lands out of
the Kings hands: And there it is further said, That the Lord by Escheat cannot
have it; for the party attainted was not his very Tenant, but he in the
Reversion; for the term yet endures: But now is to see, If the Freehold be in
the King without Office; And I conceive that it is, Where the King is entitled
to an Action, there the King ought to have an Office, and a Scire facias upon
it: As where the King is entitled to a Cessavit, Action of Waste, etc. 14 H.
7. 12. Where entry in the Case of a Common person is necessary, there behooves
to be an Office for the King. As where the Kings Villain purchases Lands, or
an Alien born, etc. so is it, for a Condition broken, Mortmain, etc. In some
Cases an Office is only necessary to instruct the King how he shall charge the
Officer for the profits, which may be supplied as well by Survey as by Office:
As if the King be to take by descent, or as the Case is here. And it is true,
That a person attainted of Felony, may during his Attainder purchase Lands, and
yet he cannot keep it against the King. And it is clear, That by the Common Law
in such Cases, the Land was in the King, but not to grant. For the Statute of
18 H. 6. was an Impediment to that; But now that defect is supplied by the
Statute of 33 H. 8. So as now the King may grant without Office. See 26 Eliz.
Cook 3 Part, Dowty's Case. And in our Case, Office is not necessary to entitle
the King, but to explain his Title. See 9 H 7. 2. The Lands of a Man attainted
of High Treason, are in the King without Office; so where the Kings Tenant
dies without Heir; or Tenant in tail of the gift of the King dies without
Issue. See Br. Office before the Escheator, 34. See 13 H. 4. 278. A Man
Attainted of Treason, the King before Office, grants his Lands and Goods;
Things which lie in Grant, as Advowsons, Rents, etc. such things upon Attainder
are in the King without Office. As to the General Pardon of 23 Eliz. He
conceived, That the same did not extend to this Case, and that this Interest of
the Queen by this Attainder did not pass by the Pardon out of the Queen; So if
the Queen had but a Right and title only.

Popham, Attorney General, By this Attainder, the Estate of him in the Remainder
in tail accrued to the Queen for the life of him in the Remainder: For by our
Law, Felony is punished by the death of the Offender, and the loss of his Goods
and Lands for the example of others, therefore nothing is left in him. Tenant
for life is attainted of Felony, The King pardons to him his life, yet he shall
have his Lands during his life; for he himself cannot dispose of them for his
life: And so it is of Tenant in tail, etc. for he may forfeit all that which he
has, and that is an Estate for his life which is the Freehold. If Lands be
given to one and his Heirs for the life of another, and the Donee be attainted
of Felony, the King shall have the Land during the life of Cestuy que vie, for
the Heir cannot have it, because the blood is corrupt, and there is not any
Occupancy in the Case: For 17 E. 3. the Justices would not accept a Fine of
Lands for the life of another, because an Occupant might be in the Case; But
for a Fine of Lands to one and his He is for the life of another, they accepted
a Fine, for there is no mischief of Occupancy. Land is given to A. for life,
the remainder to B. for life, the remainder to the right Heirs of A. who is
attainted of Felony: A. dies; now the King has a Fee executed: And here in
our Case, If this Tenant for life had been dead, no Praecipe would lie against
him in the remainder being in possession, but the party who had right was to
sue to the King by Petition. 4 E. 3. If one seized in the right of his Wife of
Lands for life, be attainted, the King shall have exitus and proficua: But I
conceive that Case is not Law: For see F.N.B. 254. D. The Husband seized in the
right of his Wife in Fee, is Outlawed of Felony; the King seiseth, the Husband
dies; Now shall issue forth a Diem Clausit extremum; the words of which Writ
are in such case, Quia A. cujus terra and Tenement. quae ipse tenuit de jure
and haereditate N. uxoris suae, adhuc superstites occasion cujusdam utlagariae
in ipsum pro quadam felonia inde indictatus fuit, etc. in manu Domini H. Patris
nostri extiterunt, etc. therefore, the King has not exitus tantum, but also
the Land it self. See to the same purpose, the Register, 292. b. And see also
now in the Book of Pleas of the Crown, 186, 187. which affirms, That Tenant
in tail being attainted of Felony, shall forfeit the Land during his life. And
he conceived, That this Estate of Tho. Venables was in the King without Office;
not to grant, for he is restrained by the Statute of 18 H. 8. but it is in him
so before Office, that he who has right ought to sue to the King by Petition,
if he will have the same; Yet he conceived, That before the said Statute of 18
H. 6. the King might grant it before Office; as it appears by Thirning, 13 H.
4. 278. which was before the Statute. So if the Kings Tenant makes a Lease for
years, the remainder over to another in Fee, who dies without Heir, the said
remainder is in the King without Office, because a common person in such case
cannot enter, but a Claim is sufficient; and therefore it shall be in the King
without Office. As to the Pardon, He conceived, That it did not extend to this
Estate; For the same is a Freehold, therefore not within the Pardon: As if the
Kings Tenant be attainted of Felony, and the King pardons him all Offenses, and
all which he may pardon; these words will not go, or extend to Freehold, but
only to personal matters, and such punishments and pains which do concern
Chattels. But it may be Objected, That in this Pardon, title of Quare Impedit,
and Re-entries for Conditions are excepted; and therefore if they had not been
excepted, they had been released by the Pardon; And therefore this Pardon does
extend to Inheritances and Freeholds. As to that, I say, That such Exceptions
were not in use in the time of King Ed. 4. and such Inheritances and Freeholds
were not taken to be within such Pardons; And such Exceptions began 5 Eliz. And
he said, he had been of Counsel in such Cases, where it had been taken, That
such Pardons did not extend to Freeholds. As, an Abbot was disseised, and
during the Disseisin, the Abbey was dissolved; the King made such a Pardon, the
same did not transfer the Kings right. And in this Case, there are diverse
Exceptions of Goods and Chattels in many cases, and therefore it cannot be
intended that this Pardon does extend to Freeholds. And see the said Act of
Pardon; There, the Queen gave and granted all Goods, Chattels, Debts, Fines,
Issues, Profits, Amercements, Forfeitures, and Sums of Money; which word
(Forfeiture) shall be intended personal forfeiture, and not otherwise, for it
is coupled with things of such nature. And as to the Traverse, he conceived,
That it did not lie in this Case; For the Office is not untrue in substance,
although it be void in Circumstances: And also the King here is entitled by
double matter of Record; i. e. the Attainder and the Office. And he said, That
the Statutes of 34 and 36 E. 3. which gave Traverse, are to be meant of Offices
found virtute Officii, and not virtute Brevis; for then Escheators were very
troublesome. And 2 E. 6. does not give traverse, but where the Office is
untruly found. As if the Kings Tenant be disseised, and the Disseisor be
Attainted; The Queen seiseth the Land; Now the Disseisee has no remedy by
traverse upon the Statute of 2 E. 6. but is put to his Monstrans de Droit, for
that the Office is true: But if I be the Kings Tenant, and seized of Lands
accordingly; and it is found that J.S. was seized of my Land, and attainted,
etc. whereas in truth, he had not any thing in my Land, there Traverse lies;
For the Office is false; And so our Case for the Traverse, is at the Common
Law. And it is true, that Venables was seized, etc.

Cook, to the contrary; And he conceived, That by the Attainder, the Queen had
gained but a Chattel; And that notwithstanding this Forfeiture, If Venables had
been in possession, a Praecipe should be brought against him. And whereas it
has been said by Mr. Attorney, That the Writs set down in the Register, are the
best Expositors of our Law; the same is not so: For the Register says, That
Waste lies notwithstanding a mean Remainder, which is not now Law, but it has
been clearly ruled to the contrary. See acc. 50 E. 3. The Register therefore,
and the Writs, are subject to the Judgments of our Law. And the Writ of Diem
clausit extremum, is not to the contrary: For I confess, that in such case,
Hob. Rep. 342.
the Land shall be seized into the Kings hands, but the King shall have but a
Chattel in it. It has been argued, He may grant, therefore he may forfeit.
Nego Consequentiam; For a Man, seized in the right of his Wife, may grant, but
not forfeit. Guardian in Socage may grant, but not forfeit; The Husband may
grant a Term for years which he has in the right of his Wife, but he cannot
forfeit it. A Woman enheritrix takes Husband, and afterward is attainted of
Felony, the King pardons him, they have Issue; the Woman dies, the Husband
shall be Tenant by the Courtesy, which proves, that the King has no Freehold
by this Attainder. Before the Statute of West. 2. Tenant in tail post prolem
suscitatam might forfeit the Land, but now the Statute has so incorporated the
Estate tail to the Tenant in tail, that it cannot be divested: yea, a Fine
levied ipso jure est nullus, although as to the possession it be a
discontinuance: And that is the reason, wherefore Tenant in tail shall not be
seized to another's use. See Stamford, 190. b. The Husband seized in the right
of his Wife, is attainted of Felony, the King shall have the Issues of the Land
of the Wife during the life of the Husband, etc. So if Tenant in tail be
Attainted of Felony, that is but a Chattel in the Lands of the Wife, and also
in the Lands of the Tenant in tail; and if the possessions of a Bishop be
seized into the Kings hands for a Contempt, In such case the King has
possession, and not only the profits: The same Law of Lands of Tenant in tail
or for life, being attainted of Felony. So seizure for alienation without
License, or of the possessions of Poor Aliens. See Br. Reseisure, 10. So where
the seizure is for Idiocy. And he conceived, That nothing is in the King
without Office. And as to the Case of 13 H. 4. 6. I confess it; For all that
time many, and amongst them Lawyers and Justices, were attainted by Parliament;
And so was Sir John Salisbury, whose Case it was, and their Lands by Act of
Parliament given expressly to the King; and therefore I grant, that their Lands
were in the King without Office. Tenant in Fee of a Common Lord is attainted of
Felony, his Lands remain in him during his life, till the entry of the Lord;
and where the King is Lord, until Office be found: but in the case of a Common
person, after the death of the person attainted, it is in the Lord before
Entry; and in the Case of the King, before Office, for the Mischief of
Abeyance. And see the Lord Lovell's Case, 18 Eliz. Plow. Com. 485, 486. Where
it is holden, That upon Attainder of Treason by Act of Parliament, the Lands
were not in the King without Office in the life of the person attainted, upon
the words of the Act, shall forfeit. See Stamford, 54, 55. acc. 3. He
conceived, That this Interest which came to the King by this Attainder, was but
a Chattel, and then it is released by the Pardon; And so he conceived, If it be
a Freehold. For the words of the General Pardon are large and liberal; Pardon
and Release all manner of Treasons, etc. And all other things, causes, etc. and
here forfeitures are pardoned; And also this word (Things) is a transcendent,
etc. And although it be a general word, yet by the direction of the General
Pardon it ought to be beneficially expounded and extended, as if all things had
been especially set down. Also the words are, Pardon them and their Heirs;
therefore the same extends to Inheritances for any Offense not excepted, for
there is the word Heirs; And the third branch does concern only Chattels, and
that is by the word Grant; where the former is, by the words, Release and
Acquit. See Br. Charter of Pardon, 71. 33 H. 8. Tenant of the King dies
seized, the Heir intrudes, Office is found; in that case by Pardons of all
Intrusions, the Offense is pardoned, but not the Issues and Profits. But by the
Pardon aforesaid, all is pardoned. And here in our Case, the Office is void;
For the Statute makes all Precepts, Conditions, void, etc. being awarded upon
such Forfeitures. See also in the second Branch, Vexed and inquieted in Body,
Good, Lands, etc. And see also amongst the Exceptions, That persons standing
endicted of wilful Murder, and forfeiture of Goods, Lands, Tenements, grown by
any Offense committed by such person; By which he conceived, That if that
Exception had not been, the Land of such a person, if he had been attainted
upon such Indictment, should be forfeited. As to the Traverse, he conceived,
That in as much as the Office is true, our plea is a Monstrans de Droit,
although it concludes with a Traverse. We vary from the Office in number of
persons, and in the day of the Feoffment; and every Circumstance in the Kings
Case is to be traversed, and our plea in substance does confess and avoid the
Office.

Although the King here be entitled by double matter of Record; i. e. the
Attainder and the Office; yet one of the said Records is discharged by another
Record; i. e. the Pardon, and then there is but one Record remaining; scil. the
Office, and therefore our Traverse does lie. And he conceived, That at the
Common Law there was a Traverse; as where it was found by Office, That the
Lessee of the King had done Waste, or cessed for two years; and there it is
said, That the Lessee and Tenant in an Action brought against them, may
traverse the Office, Therefore traverse was at the Common Law, where the King
was entitled by single matter of Record. So upon an Office finding an
Alienation without License, Traverse was by the Common Law. See Traverse in
such Case, in the Case of William de Herlington, 43 Ass. 28. See Br. Traverse,
54. Petition is by the Common Law, and Traverse by the Statute; Frowick in his
Reading. See Stamf. Prerogat. 60. That Traverse in the Case of Goods was at the
Common Law, but Traverse for Lands found by Office, by 34 E. 3. Cap. 14.
therefore the remedy was by Petition. See now, Cook 4. Part, the Sadler's Case,
55, 56. Traverse was at the Common Law concerning Freehold and Inheritance, but
that was in special Cases, when by the Office the Land is not in the Kings
hands, nor the King by that is in possession, but only by the Office, and
entitled to the Action, and cannot make seizure without suit there: in a Scire
facias brought by the King in the nature of such an Action to which he is
entitled, the party may appear unto the Scire facias, and traverse the Office
by the Common Law.

CCXXXVII. Mich. 27 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
A Writ was awarded out of the Court of Admiralty, against Sir Tho. Bacon, and
Sir Tho. Heydon, to show cause wherefore, Whereas the Earl of Lincoln late High
Admiral of England, had granted to them by Patent to be Vice Admirals in the
Counties of Norfolk and Suffolk, the said Letters Patents ought not to be
repealed and annulled. And so the said Writ was in the nature of a Scire facias.

It was moved by Cook, That although the Admiral had but an Estate for life;
yet the Patent did continue in force after his death: As the Justices here of
the Common Pleas, although they have their places but for life, may grant
Offices which shall be in force after their death: And because the same matter
is determinable at the Common Law, he prayed a Prohibition; For in the
Admiralty they would judge according to the Civil Law: The Court gave day to
the other side, to show cause, why the Prohibition should not be awarded.

CCXXXVIII. Mich. 29 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
1 Len. 302. Ante 150. Post. 230.
Account was brought by Harris against Baker, and damages were given by the
Jury: It was moved to the Court, That damages ought not to be given by way of
damages, but the damages of the Plaintiff shall be considered of by way of
Arrearges. But see the Case, Hill. 29 Eliz. in C. B. betwixt Collet and
Andrews. And yet, 10 H. 6. 18. in Account, the Plaintiff Counted to his damage,
but did not recover damages, 2 H. 7. 13. 21 H. 6. 26. The Plaintiff shall not
recover damages expressly, but the Court shall given Quoddam incrementum to the
Arrearages.

Cook said, That it had been adjudged, That the Plaintiff should recover
Damages in an Account ratione Implicationis, and non Detentionis.

CCXXXIX. Long's Case. Mich. 29 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
NOte: It was holden in this Case, If a Feoffment in Fee be made of a Manor,
to which an Advowson is appendant, and Livery is made in the Demesnes, but no
Attornment; that in such case the Advowson shall pass, but none of the Services.

CCXL. Barns Case. Mich. 29 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
BArns brought an Action of Trespass, for taking of his sack of Corn; The
Defendants justified in the behalf of the Town of Lawson in the County of
Cornwell; because, That King Phil. and Queen Mary granted to them of the said
Town, a Market to be holden within the said Town; and that the Plaintiff came
to the said Town with a sack of Corn, and the Vendor would not pay Toll, for
which cause, they took the said sack of Corn. And Judgment was given for the
Defendant. Upon which, Error was brought, and assigned for Error, because that
the Defendant pleads the Letters Patents with the date of the place, year, and
day, without saying, Magno sigillo Angliae sigillat. For it was holden, that
(hic in Curia prolat.) is but form. And afterward the Judgment was reversed,
for default of the said matter, Magno sigillo Angliae (sigillat.) And by
Anderson, Justice, Patents are good without Inrollment; and that was adjudged
in Hungate's Case.

CCXLI. Mich. 29 Eliz. In the Exchequer Chamber.
DEbt brought upon an Obligation; Post. 266.
The Defendant pleaded payment apud Lockington, in the Parish of Killmerston:
And the Venire facias was awarded de Lockington. And that was assigned for
Error in the Exchequer Chamber, upon a Judgment given in the Kings Bench, That
the Venire ought to be de Killmerston. See 6 H. 7. 3. 11 H. 7. 23, 24. 9 E. 4.
3. Trespass for Entry in the Manor of D. in S. the Visne shall come de
Vicineto de S. and not from the Manor. Contrary, if it be for the entry into
the Manor of D. only, for there it shall be de Vicineto Manerii.

Cook said, There was a Case very late adjudged in the Kings Bench; A Lease was
pleaded to be made at Ramridge End in Luton; and that he himself was of
Opinion, That the Venire ought to have been of Ramridge End, and not of Luton.
But the Court Overruled the same against him. It was said in the principal
Case, That Lockington shall be intended a Town as this Case is; For a Parish
may contain many Towns. And afterward, the Judgment was affirmed.

CCXLII. Mich. 29 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
IN Trespass, for breaking his Close; The Defendant pleaded That heretofore he
himself brought an Ejectione Firmae against the now Plaintiff of the same Land
in which the Trespass is supposed to be done, and had Judgment to recover, etc.
and demanded Judgment, if against, etc. It was moved, That the Bar was not
good, 1 Len. 313.
because that the Defendant had not averred his title, And the Recovery in one
Action of Trespass, is no Bar in another, etc. Quod Curia concessit. But as to
the matter, the Court was clear, That the Bar was good. And by Periam, Who ever
pleaded it, it was well pleaded: For as by Recovery in an Assise, the Freehold
is bound; so by Recovery in an Ejectione firmae, the possession is bound. And
by Anderson, A Recovery in one Ejectione Firmae, is a Bar in another.
Especially (as Periam said) if the party relyeth upon the Estoppel. And
afterward, Judgment was given, That the Plaintiff should be barred.

CCXLIII. Peter's Case. Mich. 29 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
WIlliam Peter's, being Plaintiff in an Action of Debt in the Common Pleas, came
to London this Term to prosecute his Action; And afterward he was committed to
the Marshalsey by the Lord Hunsdon, Chamberlain of the Queens household, and one
of her Privy Council: And now an Habeas Corpus issued out to the Keeper of the
Marshalsey, to have the body of the said Peter's in Court: And at the day, the
Keeper returned the said Writ, That the said Peter's was committed to the said
Prison, by the said Lord, and showed the Warrant for it, there to remain and to
Answer before the Lords of her Majesty's Council to such matters, etc. Causa
vero detentionis mihi omnino incognita est. The Court examined the said Peter's
upon his Oath, If he came to London to prosecute his said Cause? Who answered,
That he did. And the Court also examined the said Keeper, If he had acquainted
the said Lord with the said Writ? Who said, That he had so done; but he showed
him not any Cause. Wherefore by the Award of the Court, Peter's was discharged
of his Imprisonment.

CCXLIV. Hill. 29 Eliz. In the Common Pleass
Sergeant Fenner demanded the Opinion of the Court in this Case; A. Devised
Lands to his Wife for life, 1 Co. 155.
and afterward to B. his Son, and his Heirs, when he should come to the age of
24 years; and if his Wife died before his said Son should attain his said age
of 24 years, that then J.S. should have the said Land until the said age of the
said Son: A. died; J.S. died; the Wife died, the Son being within the age of 24
years: If the Executors of J.S. should have the Land after the death of J.S.
until the said age of the Son, was the Question.

Anderson and Periam conceived, That he should not; For this Interest limited
to J.S. by the Will, was but a possibility, which was never vested in him, and
therefore could not by any means come to his Executor. Rhodes and Windham
doubted of it.

Fenner put the Case, in 12 E. 2. Fitz. Condition, 9. Where Land is mortgaged
to J.S. upon payment of Money to J.S. such a day, or his Heirs; and before the
said day, J.S. by his Will devises, That if the Mortgagor pay the Money, that
then A. B. should have them; That this Devise of this possibility is good; Quod
omnes Justiciarii negaverunt.

And Windham put the Case between Weldon and Elkington, Plow. Com. 20 Eliz.
519. Where Lessee for years devised his Term to his Wife for so many years of
the said Term as she should live; And if she died within the Term, that then
his Son Francis should have the Residue of the Term not encurred: Francis died
Intestate; the Wife died within the Term; The Administrator of Francis had the
residue of the Term, and yet nothing was in Francis the Intestate, but a
Possibility. A Lease was made to one Hayward, his Wife, and one of his
Children; Habendum to Hayward for 99 years, if he should so long live: and if
he die within the said Term, that then his said Wife should have the said Term
for so many years which should be to come at the time of the death of her
Husband; And if she died also before the said Term, That then the Child party
to the Devise, should have it for so many years of the said Term as should not
be expired at the time of the death of the Wife. And the Case of Cicill was
vouched, 8 Eliz. Dyer, 253. A Lease was made to William Cicill, pro termino 41
annorum, si tam diu vixerit. Et si obierit infra praedictum terminum, extunc
Uxor praedicti William Cicill habebit and tenebit omnia and singula praemissa
pro residuo termini praed. incompleto, si tam diu vixerit. Et si the said Eliz.
obierit, infra praedict. terminum, tunc William Cicill filius, etc. And it was
holden by Catlyn and Dyer, That these remainders were void; For the Term is
determinable upon the death of William Cicill the Father, and the Residue of
the said Term cannot remain.

And by Anderson, The remainders of the Term limited ut supra, are void; For
every remainder ought to be certain, but here is no certainty; for it may be,
that the first possessor of the Term may live longer, or die sooner, so as he
in the remainder does not know what thing he shall have.

And so also conceived Rhodes, Justice; And he put the Case between Gravenor
and Parker, 3 and 4 Mar. Dyer, 150. A Lease was made to A. for life by
Indenture; and by the said Indenture, a Proviso was, That if the Lessee died
within the Term of 60 years then next ensuing, that then his Executors should
have it in right of the Lessee for so many of the years as should amount to the
number of 60 years, to be accounted from the date of the Indenture. And it was
holden, That the secondary Interest to the Executor was void: And that the
words concerning the same went only in Covenant.

CCXLV. The Lord Compton's Case. Trin. 29 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
2 Len. 211. Kellow. 41. 4 Inst. 85.
NOte: It was holden by the Lord Anderson, Chief Justice, in this Case, That if
Cestuy que Use after the Statute of 1 R. 2. Leaseth for years, and afterward
the Feoffees Release to the Lessee and his Heirs, having notice of the Use;
that that Release is to the first Use: But where the Feoffees are disseised,
and they Release to the Disseisor, although that they have notice of the use,
yet the same is to the use of the Disseisor: And no Subpoena lies against the
Disseisor. See 11 E. 4. 8.

CCXLVI. Sir Thomas Gorge and Dalton's Case. Trin. 29 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
SIr Thomas Gorge and the Lady Helene his Wife, brought a Quare Impedit against
Francis Dalton; Who pleaded, That the Queen was seized of the Manor of D. to
which the Advowson, etc. was appendant; and so seized, the Church became void:
And that afterward the Queen granted the said Manor with the Advowson to J.S.
who presented the Defendant. It was the clear Opinion of the Court, That by
that Grant of the Queen the Advowson did not pass; although that the King by
his Prerogative, may grant a thing in Action. Quod vide Dyer, 13 Eliz. 300.
against F.N.B. 33 and 16 H 7.

CCXLVII. Hill. 29 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
A Copyholder with the leave of the Lord Leased for years, 1 Len. 297. Hob.
Rep. 177.
and afterward surrendered the Reversion with the Rent, to the use of a
stranger; who was admitted accordingly. It was moved, If in this case there
needed any Attornment, either to settle the Reversion, or to create a privity?

It was holden in this Case by- Rhodes and Periam, Justices, That the surrender
and admittance, ut supra, are in the nature of an Inrollment, and so amount to
an Attornment; or at the least, do supply the want of it.

CCXLVIII. Carter and Marten's Case. Mich. 29 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
TWo Men made an Obligation jointly for Debt. The principal in the Obligation
made him who was surety only for him in the said Obligation for payment of the
Money, his Executor, who paid the Money generally; And, whether it shall be
said, that he paid it as Executor, or as an Obligor, was a Quaere, not resolved
by the Court.

CCXLIX. Mich. 29 Eliz. In the Exchequer.
A. Was endebted to B. who was endebted to the Queen; B. assigned his Debt unto
the Queen: By all the Barons, Process shall be awarded out of the Exchequer, to
enquire what Goods A. had at the time of the Assignment; and not what he had
tempore Scripti praedict. facti, etc.

CCL. Hill. 30 Eliz. In the Exchequer.
A. Was accomptable to J.S. and afterward J.S. was Outlawed in an Action
personal: A. died; The Queen by her Letters Patents granted unto B. omnia bona
and catalla, exitus, proficua, forisfactur. and advantagia quaecunque which
came to her, or accrued by reason of the Outlawry of the said J.S. And now B.
brought an Action of Account against the Executors of the said A. as Executors
of their own wrong. The Defendants pleaded, That they had Letters of
Administration committed to them by the Ordinary, and demanded Judgment of the
Writ. The Plaintiff in maintenance of his Writ, Replied, That the Defendants
did Administer of their own wrong, before that Administration was granted unto
them. Upon which the Defendants did demur in Law. It was the Opinion of some of
the Justices, That the wrong is urged by taking of Letters of Administration;
and now they are to be charged as Administrators only, and not otherwise. See
50 E. 3. 9. 20 H. 6. 1. And see the Case of the Cardinal of Canterbury, 9 E. 4.
33. If one Administreth of his own wrong, and afterward takes Letters of
Administration, he shall be sued not as Executor, but as Administrator. See 21
H. 6. 8.

But Gaudy, Justice, conceived, That the Defendants might be charged as
Executors. As to the Grant of the Queen of this Action of Account. See Br. Pat.
98. 32 H. 8. that the King may grant a thing in action which is personal, as
debt and damages, or the like; Or a thing mixed, as the Wardship of the body;
but not a thing real, as an Action concerning Lands, Rights, Entries. But it
was agreed on all sides, That if this Action had been granted specially, it had
been clearly good. And it was Observed, That in the principal Case the
Accomptant was dead before the Grant; so that his Executors were chargeable to
the Queen, to render an Account, and the Queen was entitled to it. It has
been Objected, That this Action of Account came to the King by reason of his
Prerogative Royal, and in virtue thereof the Executors are accomptable to her,
and therefore the Queen cannot grant the same over to a Subject: Certainly the
same is not an Incident inseparable from the Crown, nor a Flower of the Crown;
as the King cannot grant over to a Subject power to pardon Felons, for that is
proper and peculiar to the person of the King; nor that a Subject may have a
Court of Chancery: And although this matter of Account is at the first, i. e.
at the time of the Grant, uncertain; yet by matter ex post facto, it may be
reduced to certainty, i.e. by the Account; and although the Account be not
expressly named in the Letters Patents, yet the words of the Grant, ut supra, do
amount to as much. And Gaudy, Justice, conceived, That this Account ought to be
brought in the name of the Queen: And all the Justices were of Opinion, That if
the said A. had been living at the time of the said Grant of the Queen, the
Grant had not been good; for then the Action against the Executors, which is
the matter of Prerogative, had not been vested in the Queen.

CCLI. Specot's Case. Mich. 30 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
5 Co. 57.
HUmphry Specot, and Elizabeth his Wife, brought a Quare Impedit against the
Bishop of Exceter, etc. of the Church of Tedcole in the County of Devon: The
Bishop pleaded, That the Plaintiffs presented to him one John Holmes, quem
super Examinationem invenit Scismaticum inveterat', and so non habilem to be
instituted, vel ad acceptandum aliquod Beneficium cum Cura Animarum, for which
he refused him, and of such Refusal gave notice to the Plaintiffs, and of the
cause of it; upon which the Plaintiffs did demur in Law. It was argued by
Fleetwood, Sergeant, for the Bishop, but to little purpose, therefore I will
report but certain passages of his Argument: He conceived, That that general
Pleading of Schismaticus inveteratus was good enough; as, if the Bishop
certifieth Bastardy, It is sufficient to say, Bastardus, sive Spurius, without
other Circumstances, as to say, On the body of such a Woman begotten: Lollard
derivatur a Lollio. i. e. Anglice, Tares. Sampson was Dean of Christ Church in
Oxford, and was convented before the Ordinary for Schism, because he would not
use a Surplice; and for that he was condemned for a Schismatic, and deprived
of his Deanery, in the time of the Queen that now is. Shuttleworth, Sergeant,
for the Plaintiffs, That the Bishop in his Plea ought to have showed specially,
how and in what point the Presentee of the Plaintiffs was Schismaticus: There
are diverse manners of Schisms. 1. In Doctrine. 2. In manners; and of each kind
there are many, etc. And therefore, for doubt of enveigling the Metropolitan,
who is to try that Issue, the Defendant ought to have showed the Schism in
certain, in which the Metropolitan was to examine the Clerk readily. See 38 E.
3. 2. the Case of the Countess of Arundel, where in a Quare Impedit the
Ordinary pleaded, That the Presentee was Criminosus and Perjurus, and showed
the Cause in what and when he was Perjured. And although this Issue is to be
tried by the Metropolitan, yet it ought to be formally pleaded in the Temporal
Court, and with certainty: As where a Divorce is pleaded, It is not sufficient
to say, That a Divorce was had; but the party ought to show for what cause, and
before what Judge the Divorce was had, which see 18 E. 4. 29. where the Divorce
is specially pleaded for cause of Consanguinity; for by one Divorce the Issues
are bastardized, by others not. See as to the Pleading of a Divorce 11 H. 7. 9.
Profession, although it be a Spiritual thing, yet the general Pleading of it,
is not good; but he who pleads it, ought to show, of what Order, and under
whose Obedience, 40 E. 3. 37. which see the Book of Entries 444. Intravit
Religionem, viz. in Domo Carmelitarum de London, and ibi fuit professus sub
Obedientia R. Prioris Domus illius. So Deprivation shall not be generally
pleaded, which see Book of Entries 458. Ecclesia vacavit per Privationem, etc.
per J.S. Legum Doctor. Delegat. etc. so of Resignation, 7 E. 4. 16. Resignavit
in manus I.L. Bishop of London, Ordinary of the said place. Now, It is to see,
If by this general Demurrer the matter in Fact be confessed, scil. That the
Presentee was Schismaticus inveteratus; and as to that, the Rule is, That all
matters in Fait, which are well and duly pleaded, by a general Demurrer be
confessed; but that which is not well alleged, by no Demurrer shall be holden
confessed: Which Learning see in the Commentaries, in Partridge and Stranges
Case. And here for as much as Scismaticus is not not well pleaded, for the
cause aforesaid, it shall not be holden confessed. Now, It is to see, If upon
the Statute of 27 Eliz. this defect be helped; and he conceived it was not, for
here the defect is in matter, and not in form: As if, in Trespass of his Close
breaking, the Defendant justifies by a Lease for years, and does not show the
place where the Lease was made, and the Plaintiff demurrs generally upon it;
the said defect is not helped by the said Statute, for that it is Matter. So in
a Formedon in Discender, The Defendant pleads a Warranty with Assets, without
showing the place where the Assets is, and the Demandant demurrs upon it
generally, the same defect is not helped by the said Statute: See a good Case
adjudged upon the Statute, Mich. 28 and 29 Eliz. between Henly and Broad.
Periam and Windham, Justices, conceived, That the Plea of the Bishop is not
good, because it is not showed in what point the Presentee was Schismaticus;
for by this genral Pleading, if it should be allowed, the Metropolitan, to whom
the Trial of the Cause belongs, shall be driven to peruse all Schisms, in the
Examination of the Presentee, which is a thing infinite and inconvenient.
Rhodes, and the Lord Anderson, to the Contrary: And Rhodes vouched an Old Book,
30 E. 1. out of a written Book of the Lord Catline. In a Quare non admisit, the
Defendant pleaded, That the Clerk presented was Schismaticus and Adulter, and
the Court commanded, that he hold himself to one of them, for which he said,
Adulter; so as the Court did not mislike the Plea for the generality, but for
the doubleness. And by Anderson, Our Case is not like the Cases put by
Shuttleworth; for they concern things tryable by our Law, in which Case, to
have convenient trial, all matters issuable ought to be specially alleged; but
here the Case is otherwise, and no peril of Trial. And by the said Statute of
27 Eliz. we ought to judge according to the right of the Cause, and matter in
Law. See this Case adjudged upon a Writ of Error brought in the Kings Bench.
Hill. 32 Eliz. in Cook 5 Part, 57. Specot's Case.

CCLII. Estrigge and Owles's Case. Trin. 30 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
IN an Action upon the Case by Estrigge against Owls, It was holden by the
Justices, Ante 73.
That forbearance per paululum tempus, is a good Consideration. Then it was
moved, That in the Action, the Request was not sufficiently laid in respect of
the place and time.

And Cook said, That the difference had always been agreed, That where the
promise is to do a Collateral thing upon Request, there in the Declaration, the
place and the time ought to be certainly set down; As it was holden in the Case
of Alderman Pulison; where he promised to give a Cun of Wine upon request, Ante
73.
in such case the request is traversable, and therefore it ought to be
certainly showed, for the request is parcel of the Issue: But if such Action be
brought, and the Plaintiff declares upon an Indebitatus, then if the Plaintiff
prove the Debt, it is not material to prove the promise; for every Contract
executory implies a promise: and in such case, the request is not traversable.
And the truth of the Case was, That one Tickil was endebted to the Plaintiff in
30 l. and died Intestate; B. his Wife took Letters of Administration, and took
to Husband the Defendant; And he, for the Consideration aforesaid, and that the
Plaintiff would forbear his Debt for a little time, promised to pay it: And
further declared, That he had forborne, etc. from such a day, until such a day;
but yet the Defendant would not pay it, licet saepius requisitus: And upon this
Declaration, the Plaintiff had Judgment: And now a Writ of Error was brought,
and it was assigned for Error because that in the Declaration it is alleged,
That the Wife Administered the Goods of the Intestate, and did not show, that
she was Administratrix, etc. and took Letters of Administration. 2. It is not
alleged, That the Wife had Goods of the Testator at the time of the promise,
for otherwise she shall not be bound. For it is but Nudum pactum; for Executors
or Administrators, not having Assets, shall not be charged. And it was holden
here, That Request is not necessary, for the debt was before the promise, so as
the Request is not any cause of the Action.

CCLIII. Matthews's Case. Pasch. 30 Eliz. In the King Bench.
NOte; That a Bill of Perjury, upon the Statute of 5 Eliz. was sued by the
Queen and the party, because that the Defendant being one of the Homage, etc.
did present with the rest of the Homagers, That the Plaintiff had cut down
certain Trees, etc. Whereas in truth he had not cut down any. And it was holden
by all the Justices, That for this matter, the Bill did not lie upon this
Statute; For this branch of the Statute is to be intended of Perjury in
Depositions only.

And by Tanfield, A Bill does not lie upon the Statute upon Perjury committed
in an Answer to a Bill in Chancery. See 41 Eliz. Flower's Case.

CCLIV. Trin. 30 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
Co. Rep. Gatewards Case.
IN a Replevin, The Defendant avowed for Damage Feasant; The Plaintiff in bar of
the Avowry, showed, That every Inhabitant in every Message in the said Town
had used to have Common in the place where, etc.

Glanvile argued, That the prescription was not good, for want of Capacity in
the party who pretends Interest, for it is not certain, but applied to a
Multitude: and he put diverse Cases in proof of it: 22 H. 6. 21 H. 7. 1. Mar.
Dyer, 100. The King grants a Rent probis hominibus of Islington; the same is
void, for they are not capable.

Harris, I conceive, That the Prescription is good; And he granted, That a
confused Multitude cannot prescribe in a matter of Interest, but in an
Easement, or discharge; As in a Way to the Church, and that by reason of Custom
in the Land, and not in the persons. See 7 E. 4. 26. Where it is pleaded, That
all the Inhabitants within such a Town time out of mind, etc. have used to have
Common there, etc. And for a Township to have a Way to the Church; And good, by
Danby. And, by Littleton, it ought to be pleaded by way of usage. And, 18 E. 4.
3. All the Inhabitants of such a Town, may well prescribe. And he cited
Bracton, 222, 223. Communia quandocunque ex longo usu sive constitutione cum
pacifica possessione continue and non intermixta, ex scientia, negligentia, and
patientia Dominor', ita etiam amitti potest per negligentiam, and non usum. And
he vouched Britton, fol. 144. Common is obtained by long sufferance; and also
it may be lost by long negligence, etc.

CCLV. Pie and Grunway's Case. Mich. 30 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
IN Trespass brought by Pie against Grunway, and one B. The Plaintiff declared
against Grunway only, who pleaded not guilty: And it was found for the
Plaintiff. And in Arrest of Judgment, it was moved, That the Plaintiff in
declaring against one only, had falsified his own Writ. To that it was said,
That at the uttermost it is but a discontinuance, so but matter of form, and so
relieved by the Statute of 18 Eliz. But it was said by the Court, that it may
be, That B. was outlawed at the Plaintiffs suit, and then the proceedings is
determined as against him. And the Court demanded of the Clerks, If the use of
the Court be not so in such case to declare, That Grunway simul cum B. utlagat.
ad sectam Querentis did the Trespass? Who answered, Not in this Action: but in
an Action of Debt, it is otherwise: And afterward, notwithstanding that
Exception, Judgment was given against the Plaintiff.

CCLVI. Thorp and Wingfield's Case. Trim. 30 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
IN Waste, the Plaintiff declared upon a Lease for years generally; and the
truth of the Case was, That the Plaintiff had made a Lease for years to one A.
which Lease being in force for two years, he Leased the same Lands for years,
as he has declared, to begin presently; and the Waste which is assigned in the
Declaration, was done during the first Lease: And now, If the Defendant upon
this matter might plead, No waste done, was the Question. And it was said by
the Court, That such a plea should be perilous for the Defendant, for it shall
be found against him; and if he pleads the special matter aforesaid, scil.
The former Lease in esse at the time of the Waste committed; after the
expiration of which Lease, no Waste was done: If the second Lease be not by
Indenture, it should be a good Plea; but if by Indenture, then the Plaintiff
would estop him by the Indenture, to show, that the second Lease has another
beginning than the Indenture purports, and then the Waste shall charge the
Defendant; And although the Plaintiff had not declared upon a Lease by
Indenture, yet if the Defendant pleaded the special matter aforesaid, he by way
of Replication shall estop the Defendant to plead any other beginning of the
Term than the Letter of the Indenture does purport; and the same shall be no
Departure, for it is matter which strengthens the Declaration.

CCLVII. Botham and the Lady Gresham's Case. Pasch. 30 Eliz. In the Common
Pleas.
IN a Prohibition by Botham and Couper, 1 Len. 94. 1 Cro. 71. 1 Len. 128. Post.
265.
against the Lady Gresham who had impleaded them in the Spiritual Court for
Tythe-Hay, and made their Suggestion, That time out of mind, etc. they had paid
to the Vicar of the said Parish 4 d. for the Tithe of Hay of every Acre; It was
moved, That upon that surmise a Prohibition ought not to be granted, for that a
Modus Decimandi shall never come in Question: But the party ought to have
pleaded the same matter in the Spiritual Court, scil. That the same does
appertain to the Vicar, and not to the Parson: and then if the Vicar sueth for
the Tithe of the Hay, the Modus Decimandi will come in Question; and although
that he has averred in his surmise, that the Tythe-Hay belongs to the Vicar,
yet that is not material: And afterward a Consultation was awarded.

CCLVIII. Rush and Heighgate's Case. 30 Eliz. In the Exchequer.
2 Len. 121. Co. 4. Rep. Palmers Case
PRocess was awarded out of the Exchequer, against Rush, for the levying of the
sum of 200 l. which he owed to the Queen; Upon which, It was found by Office,
That Rush, 22 Junii, 22 Eliz. was possessed of Lands for the Term of diverse
years then and yet to come; And the Debt of the Queen began 12 Feb. 17 Eliz.
And upon the Retorn of this Office, came one Heighgate, and showed, That the
said Rush, 16 Eliz. was possessed of the said Lease, and the same year assigned
the same to the said Heighgate, and traversed the Office.

Exception was taken to the Inquisition, Because that the Lease is not
certainly set forth; scil. the number of the years in certainty.

Cook, The Office is sufficient enough, notwithstanding this Exception, for the
Queen is a stranger to the Lease, and therefore she shall not be driven to set
forth the certainty. See 7 E. 6. Plowden, 85. Partridge's Case, upon the
Statute of 32 H. 8. concerning pretended Titles, etc. there the Informer
declared, That ihe Defendant had Leased Lands for years against the said
Statute, etc. without showing the number of the years; and the Information was
holden good enough: for it is impossible, that a stranger have notice of every
certainty, etc. and it is dangerous to meddle with such a particular certainty
of the Lease, and to miss it: And in this Case, for as much as Heighgate comes
to this Lease not by voluntary Contract, but by compulsory means; scil. by
Execution upon the Statute, he cannot by common Intendment have notice of every
particular Circumstance and Article of the Lease, as he may in case of a
voluntary Contract. And also, although in pleading, the number of the years
ought to be expressed, yet in an Inquisition such precise pleading is not
requisite. See 15 H. 7. 7. An estate tail, and dying seized of it, was found by
Office, without showing of whose gift it was; and good enough.

CCLIX. Trin. 30 Eliz. In the Exchequer.
ONe exhibited a Bill in the Exchequer Chamber, upon the Statute of 2 E 6. Cap.
13. to have the treble value, for not setting forth his Tithes according to the
said Statute. But it was clearly holden by the Court, That the Bill did not lie
upon that matter; for the Plaintiff has his remedy for the same in the Court
of Pleas in the Exchequer: And also for that there shall be no suit or
proceedings according to the Order of the Exchequer Chamber in Cases of
Conscience, upon any penal Statute.

CCLX. Body and Tassell's Case. Trin. 30 Eliz. In the Exchequer.
NOte: That in the Case between Body and Tassell, It was holden by Baron Clark,
That if a Man lends Money, and for the forbearing of it, contracts for more
than 10 l. in the 100 l. That the Bond made for it, is void presently; and that
if he does receive excessive Interest, that he shall forfeit treble the value.

CCLXI. Markham and Pitts's Case. Trin. 30 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
IN an Action upon the Case upon a Trover by Markham against Pitts; the
Defendant after an Imparlance, pleaded an Outlawry of the Plaintiff: And it was
holden by some, to be a good Bar, and therefore it may be pleaded after
Imparlance; As 16 E. 4. 4. in Debt upon a Specialty: But not in Debt upon a
Contract, Trespass, Battery, Imprisonment, etc. for, such matters the King
shall not have by Outlawry.

CCLXII. Crane and Juniper's Case. Trin. 30 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
THomas Crane brought an Action upon the Case against Juniper, and one John
Matthew, upon an Assumpsit; and declared, That in Consideration that the
Plaintiff took upon him, That whereas William Matthew was endebted unto him in
diverse sums of Money at the time of the death of the said William, that he would
not molest the said Defendants being Executors of the said William Matthew
before the 10th day of May next following, the Defendants promised to pay to
the Plaintiff debitum praedict. at the said 10th day of May; And declared
further, Quod non molestavit: and yet, although saepius requisite. the
Defendants had not paid him, etc. And upon Non Assumpsit pleaded, It was found
for the Plaintiff. And it was Objected, That the Plaintiff had not maintained
nor averred his Assumpsit; for the words of it are, Non molestavit nominatos
Executores Testamenti and ultimae Voluntatis William Matthew; but he ought to
have averred more specially, quod non molestavit Juniper and Matthew, named
Executors of William Matthew, nor any of them, by their names: Also he ought to
have pleaded, Quod non molestavit, before the said 10th day of May, according
to his promise. And also he ought to have showed in his Declaration, how that
he did not trouble them for the Debt of the Testator, etc.

CCLXIII. Walcot and Powell's Case. Pasch. 30 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
THe Case was, That in an Action of Debt brought against the Husband and Wife,
The Plaintiff declared upon an Obligation made by the Wife dum sola fuit; and
the Writ was in the Detinet tantum: And upon Judgment given in that Action, a
Writ of Error was brought in the Kings Bench; And that matter was assigned for
Error; And by Cook, The Writ ought to be in the Debet and Detinet; for the
Husband has the Goods of the Wife in his own right; and so is the Register,
140.

CCLXIV. Wigmore and Wells's Case. Pasch. 30 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
THree were bound in a Bond by these words, Obligamus nos and quemlibet nostrum
Conjunctim. And it was holden by the Court to be a joint Bond, and not several;
for the word Quemlibet is expounded by the word Conjunctim.

CCLXV. Pasch. 30 Eliz. In the Exchequer.
IT was holden by the Court in this Case, That if a stranger enters upon the
Farmor of the Queen, that by such Entry, he has gained the Estate for years:
and if he does make a Lease unto another, his Lessee may maintain an Ejectione
Firmae.

CCLXVI. Abbot's Case. Pasch. 30 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
ALice Abbot brought an Action upon the Case upon 5 several Assumpsits, and in
the close of her Declaration, it was Et praedict. J.S. licet saepius
requisitus, etc. and so there was but one licet saepius requisitus to all the 5
Assumpsits; whereas every several Assumpsit ought to have his several demand;
for one general Request for all is not sufficient: For it has been adjudged,
Where one is endebted to me severally in several sums of Money, made upon
request, or demand made; And I go to him, and say to him, Pay me what you owe
me; the same is not a sufficient demand or request. Wray, If one lends me
Money, to repay it when he shall be required; Licet saepius requisitus is not
sufficient: but if the Plaintiff declares upon a Cum indebitatus fuisset, the
Defendant assumed to pay; there Licet saepius requisitus is sufficient.

CCLXVII. Stackford's Case. Pasch. 30 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
STackford, was endicted for disclosing the Counsel of the Queen, and of his
Companions, being sworn upon the Grand Enquest for the County of Middlesex in
this manner: It was intended by the Jury to endict the Brother of the said
Stackford as a common Barrettor, and he disclosed the same to his Brother, and
upon that matter he was endicted, and exception was taken to the Endictment,
because it is not showed in what thing he had disclosed their Counsel; 2. It is
said, in Trinity Term, 29 Eliz. he disclosed; but it is not said what day of
the month it was done; 3. The Endictment is that he being sworn coram
Justiciariis Dominae Reginae, etc. and it is not showed in what Court he was
sworn, but generally at Westminster. The Justices were all of Opinion, that it
was a lewd part, and that he should be fined for it; but he was discharged from
the Endictment.

CCLXVIII. The Town of Green in Sussex's Case. Pasch. 30 Eliz. In the Kings
Bench.
THe Town of Green in Sussex was amerced for the escape of a Felon, and that
Amercement was grounded upon an Inquisition taken before the Coroner by whom
the Escape was found; and it was moved for the Town, that there is not any such
Escape found, for which the Town ought to be amerced: For it is found that he
who escaped 10 Die Januarij. 30 Eliz. circa horam quartam post meridiem, with a
Pitchfork mortally struck one A. which A. of the said stroke died 8 hours in
the Evening of the same day, and that then the other escaped; For which Escape
being done in the night, the Town by the Law ought not to be amerced, for it is
not Felony until the party dies. Which see 11 H. 4. and in Cole's Case 13
Eliz. Plow. Com. 401. And therefore the Town nor any other was charged with the
offender before the party wag dead. Wray, It should be a hard thing that the
Town should be amerced upon this matter; for, although the Town in discretion
might have stayed the party, yet it is not bounden to do it, etc.

CCLXIX. Bland and Riccard's Case. Mich. 30 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
1 Cro. 225.
THe Case was, that process of Attachment issued out of the Chancery against the
Defendant, by force of which he was taken by the Plaintiff being Under Sheriff;
who took Bond of him, upon which Bond Debt was brought; the Bond being for his
appearance at the day contained in the Attachment. It was the clear Opinion of
the whole Court, That the Bond was void; for that the Defendant was not
bailable upon the Attachment: See the Case of Dive and Manningham, 4 E. 6.
Plowden, 61, 62.

CCLXX. Fetherstone and Huttchinson's Case. Trin. 30 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
IN an Action upon the Case, the Plaintiff declared, That whereas one Hill had
recovered in an Action of Debt against J.S. 10 l. upon which a Capias was
awarded against J.S. that by force thereof he was Arrested, and being under
Arrest, the Defendant in consideration that the Plaintiff would suffer the said
J.S. to go at large circa negotia sua, and to go to his own House, and also in
consideration of 2 d. paid to the Defendant, he promised to pay to the
Plaintiff the said 10 l. It was holden by the Court, a void promise within the
Statute of 23 H. 6. For, the consideration to let a Prisoner go at large is not
lawful or good; and if part of the Consideration be not good, the whole is
naught, and so it was adjudged.

CCLXXI. Stretton and Brown's Case. Trin. 30 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
IN a false Imprisonment brought, the Defendant justified, because at the time
he was Constable of D. and appointed the Plaintiff to watch, and he refused, by
reason of which he set him in the Stocks; upon which the Plaintiff did demur in
Law, because the Defendant had not alleged, that the Plaintiff was an
Inhabitant within the Town; For the Constable cannot compel strangers which
pass, to watch: And it was moved, If for such a Cause the Constable might set
one in the Stocks; for it was said, he ought to complain of his refusal to a
Justice of the Peace. Also the Constable cannot appoint any to watch at his
pleasure, but only in his turn, for otherwise the Constable might upon a
private revenge vex his Neighbors. See 22 E 4. 35. Wray, Chief, Justice, The
Defendant ought to show, That the Plaintiff was Inhabitant in the Town, and
that it was his Turn to Watch: and if such Inhabitant refuse to Watch in his
Turn, the Constable may set him in the Stocks.

CCLXXII. Paramour and Tho. Robinson's Case. Trin. 30 Eliz. In the Exchequer.
THe Case was, George Robinson Lessee for years of the Manor of
Drayton-Basset, the Reversion to the King, devised his Term to his Wife, as
long as she should keep her self a Widow, the remainder over, if she married;
and died, and made his Wife and William his Son his Executors, the said William
being within age; And therefore Administration was committed to the Wife alone,
and she only proved the Will: And afterward the Wife granted all her Interest
to the said William, and died.

Cook, Nothing passes by the Grant, for William had the Term before; for every
Executor has an entire Interest.

Popham, Contrary; for at the time of that Grant, the Son was within age, and
had not administered, nor proved the Will; therefore in effect the Wife was sole
Executrix.

Egerton, Solicitor, If during the sole Executorship of the Wife, one
commits a Trespass upon the Land, the Wife alone shall have the Action of
Trespass without naming her Co-executor: Which Cook denied. And he cited the
Case, 16 H. 7. 4. If two Executors be, and one of them only is possessed of the
Goods of the Testator, and a stranger takes them out of his possession, to whom
the other Executor does release; and afterward the Executor out of whose
possession the Goods were taken, brings an Action of Trespass against the
Trespassor, who pleads the Release of the other Executor; It was holden a good
Plea; for the possession of the one, was the possession of the other. The Case
was further, That Tho. Robinson the Defendant in pleading had showed, That
George Robinson was possessed, and devised the same to his Wife, who granted
the same to William, who devised the same to the Defendant. On the other side,
it was showed, That Tho. Robinson the Defendant granted the said Term to
Paramour the Plaintiff; upon which they were at Issue. And the Question now
was, If Tho. against his own pleading might give in Evidence, That Thomas did
not grant; For if the gift by the Wife to William was void, and he had the Term
as Executor, Then he could not Devise it. And it was showed also, That Thomas
granted it by Indenture to Paramour: And now, If against that Indenture, he
might give in Evidence such special matter, was the doubt. And, If the party
shall be concluded if the Jury shall be concluded ad dicendum veritatem?

And by Popham and Egerton, As well the Jurors as the parties are concluded by
the confession of the parties in the Record. For here, Thomas confesses, That
William devised to him; virtute cujus, 2 Co. 4.
he was possessed.

To that the Queens Attorney said, That it is true, that Thomas Robinson was
possessed; but it is further said, That Thomas granted it to Paramour, and so
the Interest of Thomas is confessed on both sides, and therefore the Jury shall
not be received to say the contrary.

But the Opinion of Manwood, Chief Baron, was, That if the parties do admit a
thing per nient dedire, the Jury is not bound by it; but where, upon the
pleading a special matter is confessed, there the Jury shall be bound by it.
And afterward, the Issue was found against Robinson the Defendant.

CCLXXIII. Trin. 30 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
IN an Action of Debt by A. against B. upon an Obligation, the Defendant
pleaded tender of the Money according to the Condition; upon which the parties
were at Issue. And after the Defendant pleaded, That after the Darrein
Continuance, the Debt now in demand was Attached in the Defendants hands
according to the Custom of London, for the debt of C. to whom the Plaintiff was
endebted. It was the Opinion of the Court, That the Plea was insufficient, for
it is altogether contrary to the first Plea. And also the Court held, That, in
an Action for the debt depending here in this Court, the debt cannot be
attached; and the Court would not suffer a Demurrer to be joined upon it, but
overruled the Case without any Argument; For it was said by Wray, Chief
Justice, That it was against the Jurisdiction of the Court, and the Privilege
of it.

CCLXXIV. Trin. 30 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
NOte: It was holden by the Court, That if a Copyholder in Fee dies seized,
and the Lord admits a stranger to the Land who enters, that he is but a Tenant
at Will, and not a Disseisor to the Copyholder who has the Land by descent,
because he comes in by the assent of the Lord, etc.

CCLXXV. Trin. 30 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
AN Ejectione firmae was brought de uno Cubiculo; and Exception was taken to
it: But the Exception was disallowed. The Declaration was special, viz, and
Leas unius Cubiculi, per nomen unius Cubiculi, being in such a House, in the
middle story of the said House. And the Declaration was holden good enough; and
the word Cubiculum, is a more apt word, than the word Camera: And such was the
Opinion of Wray, Chief Justice. And it was said, That Ejectione firmae brought
de una rooma, had been adjudged good in this Court.

CCLXXVI. Johnson and Bellamy's Case. Rot. 824. Mich. 30 and 31 Eliz. In the
Common Pleas.
IN an Ejectione firmae, It was holden by Special Verdict, 1 Cro. 122.
That W. Grant was seized of certain Lands, and by his Will devised the same
to Joan his Wife for life: And further he willed, That when Rich. his Brother
should come to the age of 25 years, that he should have the Land to him and the
Heirs of his body lawfully begotten. W. Grant died, having Issue of his body
who was his Heir. Rich. before he attained the age of 25 years, levied a Fine
of the said Lands with proclamations in the life and during the seisin of Joan
to A. sic ut parts finis nihil habuerunt: And, If this Fine should bar the
Estate in tail, was the Question? And the Justices cited the Case of the Lord
Zouch, which was adjudged, Mich. 29 Eliz. Where the Case was, Tenant in tail
discontinued to E. and afterward levied a Fine to B. That although that parts
finis nihil habuerunt, yet the said Fine did bind the Estate tail. But the
Sergeants at the Bar argued, That there was a difference between the Case
cited, and the Case at Bar: For in the Case cited, the Fine was pleaded in Bar;
but here it was not pleaded, but found by Special Verdict. To which it was said
by the Court, That the same is not any difference; For the Fine by the Statute
is not any matter of Estoppel or Conclusion, but by the Statute binds and
extincts the entail, and the right of it. And Fines are as sufficient to bind
the right of the entail when they are found by Special Verdict, as when they
are pleaded in Bar.

And Periam, Justice, said, A Collateral Warranty found by Special Verdict, is
of as great force, as pleaded in Bar. And afterward Judgment was given, That
the Estate tail by that Fine was utterly barred and extinct.

CCLXXVII. Mich. 30 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
THe Case was, A Man made a Lease for life, rendering Rent at Michaelmas; and
further Leased the same to the Executors of the Lessee until Michaelmas, after
the death of the Lessee. It was affirmed by Cook, That in that Case, it was
adjudged, That the word (Until) shall be construed to extend to the Term unto
the end of the Feast of St. Michael, and so the Rent then due payable by the
Executors; for without such Construction, no Rent should be then due, because
the Term ended before Michaelmas.

CCLXXVIII. Pasch. 30 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
ONe was bounden to stand to the Award of two Arbitrators, who awarded, That
the party should pay to a stranger or his Assigns 200 l. before such a day: The
stranger before the day died; B. took Letters of Administration. The Question
was, If the Obligee should pay the Money to the Administrator, or if the
Obligation was discharged. It was the Opinion of the whole Court, That the Money
should be paid to the Administrator, for he is an Assignee. And by Gaudy, If
the word (Assigns) had been left out, yet the payment ought to be made to the
Administrator; Which Cook granted.

CCLXXIX. Pasch. 30 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
THe Defendant in Debt, being ready at the Bar to wage his Law, was examined by
the Court, upon the points of the Declaration, and the cause of the Debt; upon
which it appeared, that the Plaintiff and Defendant were reciprocally endebted
the one to the other: And accompting together, they were agreed, That each of
them should be quit of the other. It was the Opinion of Periam and Anderson,
Justices, That upon that matter, the Defendant could not safely wage his Law;
For it is but an agreement, which cannot be executed, but by Release or
Acquittance.

CCLXXX. Pasch. 30 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
TEnant in tail Covenanted with his Son to stand seized to the use of himself
for life, and afterward to the use of his Son in tail, the remainder to the
right Heirs of the Father: The Father levied a Fine with proclamations, and
died. It was moved by Fenner, If any Estate passed to the Son by that Covenant?
for it is not any discontinuance, and so nothing passed but during his life;
and all the Estates which are to begin after his death, are void.

Anderson, Justice, The Estate passes until, etc. And he cited the Case of one
Pitts, where it was adjudged, That if Tenant in tail of an Advowson in gross,
grants the same in Fee, and a Collateral Ancestor releaseth with warranty, and
dies, that the same is a good bar for ever.

CCLXXXI. Ognell's Case. Pasch. 30 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
IN a Replevin against Ognel, who avowed for Rent; Clayton Rep. 91.
the Plaintiff was Nonsuit; the Question was, Whether the Court might assess
Damages, without a Writ of Enquiry of Damages? It was the Opinion, That they
might; for they are not in respect of any local matter, but they accrue to the
Avowant, for the delay in the non-payment of the Rent: Contrary, where Judgment
is given for the Plaintiff, there, the Court shall not assess the Damages, for
he ought to recover for the taking of his Cattle, of which the Judges cannot
take notice; and the Damages may be greater or less according to the value of
the Cattle, and the Circumstances of the taking and delaying of them.

CCLXXXII. Hitchcock and Harvy's Case. Mich. 30 and 31 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
HItchcock brought an Action of Trespass for breaking of his Close, and
spoiling of his Grass, against Harvey: and the Case was, That A. was seized of
the Land in which, etc. and granted to the Plaintiff proficuum of such a Mead
called Tentry Mead, post falcationem inde; scil. the Ear-grass. And it was
found by Verdict, That Ear-grass is such Grass, which is upon the Land after
the mowing, until the Feast of the Annunciation after. It was moved, If such a
Grantee might have Trespass, Quare Clausum fregit? And it was the Opinion of
the Court, 1 Cro. 421.
That he could not; but for spoiling the Grass he might

Clench, Justice, If a Man be Outlawed in an Action personal, The Queen has
the profits of the Land, and lets the same to another, He shall have an Action
of Trespass, Quare Clausum fregit; Which Shute granted: And afterward because
the Jury had given Damages entire, as well for the breaking of the Close, as
for the spoiling of the Grass, the Plaintiff could not recover the Damages.

CCLXXXIII. Chard and Tuck's Case. Hill. 30 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
1 Cro. 41. 1 Cro. 15, 16 114, 170.130. Shep. Touch. 94. Bro. Tit. Judgment 83.
IN an Ejectione firmae by Chard against Tuck, It was found by special Verdict,
That A. was seized of a Message, and of a Curtilage, and of a Garden to the
same belonging in Fee; and that the Curtilage was on the back side of the said
House, and the Garden next beyond the said Curtilage, the Garden being divided
from the Curtilage by a Wall, and a Door through the Wall into the Garden from
the said Curtilage, and no Way to either of them, but through the House. And it
was further found, That the said A. by his Will devised the said Message to B.
The Question was, If by that Devise, the Curtilage and Garden did pass. Vide
inde Br. 23 H. 8. Feoffments, 53. Where a Feoffment is made of such a Message
cum pertinentiis, they shall pass. Curtilage, is a member, at the least an
Appendix of a Message. And by the clear Opinion of the whole Court in the Case
at Bar, It was Resolved, That by this Devise, the Curtilage and Garden did pass.

And it was said by Wray, Chief Justice, It matters not, Whether the Curtilage
and Garden be before the House, or behind it; for in both Cases they shall pass.

CCLXXXIV. Baxter's Case. Mich. 30 Eliz. In the Exchequer.
AN Information in the Exchequer, was exhibited against Baxter of Cambridge,
upon the Statute of 7 E. 6. Cap. 5. of Wines, and the selling of them against
the purview of the said Statute. To which the Defendant pleaded, That King
Rich. the second in the 5th year of his Reign, Granted unto the Chancellor and
his Deputy, and the Scholars of the University of Cambridge, Custodiam assisae
panis, vini, and Cervisiae, and correctionem and punitionem eorundum; 4 Inst.
229.
And that the Queen that now is, confirmed the said Grant in the third year of
her Reign by her Letters Patents; which were after confirmed by Act of
Parliament, 13 Eliz. And so pleaded to the Jurisdiction of the Court. Upon
which, It was demurred in Law.

Harris argued for the Queen; and said, That the Defendant could not plead that
matter to the Jurisdiction of the Court at that time, for it is now too late,
for that he has oftentimes imparled, and that generally: In which case, the
Court having general and ordinary Jurisdiction and Authority to hold plea of
such matters, shall have Conusans of them, notwithstanding the matter which
has been showed, and set forth. On the other side, It has been said, Quod
Assisa venit de assidendo; that is, to have the Assise, as well in respect of
the price, as of the measure: Which although it be admitted, yet the same shall
not help them; For they of Cambridge have not Assisam ipsam; but only,
Custodiam assisae, i.e. that the Assise, set down by the Queen and her Council,
be well kept; And that no other price, or measure be used in the uttering of
Wines.

Popham, The Queens Attorney, to the same intent. The Statute of 51 H. 1.
Ordains, That when Wheat is at such a price in the Market, then every penny
Loaf is to weigh so much; and so when Barley is at such a price, then so much
Beer shall be sold for a penny: And that was the general Assize limited by the
said Statute: In these Cases, the University cannot appoint another Assize,
than that which is set down by the said Statute; but to take care, that the
said Statute be well executed in such Assise. See the Statute of 31 E. 1. of
Wines, scil. That Wines shall be sold according to the Assize of the King; i.
e. 12 d. the Gallon: And in that matter, the University has Custodiam only;
i.e. the survey of the Assize, and the execution of it, and authority to punish
the Offenses against the said Statutes, as well in the price, as in the measure
according to the said Statutes, and not otherwise, etc. And as to the Statute
of 7 E. 6. Cap. 5. By which it is provided, That the said Statute shall not be
prejudicial to any of the Inhabitants of Oxford, or Cambridge, or unto the
Chancellor, or Scholars there to impair their Liberties, etc. The same ought to
be intended, that the Liberties and Franchises which the Universities had
before by the Grant, ut supra, etc. i. e. to punish such Offenses against the
Assise, according to the old Statutes. For the said Statute of 7 E. 6. Cap. 5.
being in the Affirmative, does not take away the punishment appointed by any
other Statute; but does continue the same. And a further penalty is appointed,
propter ulteriorem poenam.

And as to that which has been said, That by the said Grant of Rich. the 2d, 3
Cro. 52, 62
they have granted to them Cognitionem omnium Actionum personalium inter partem
and partem, That will not help the University in this Case: For the Informer by
the Statute, has Liberty to sue in what Court he will in any of the Kings
Courts of Record. And in this Case, the Queen is quodam modo a party; For she
is to have the moiety; And so this cause is not merely betwixt party and party,
etc.

CCLXXXV. Willoughby's Case. Trin. 30 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
2 Len. 117.
WIlliam Willoughby, and two other were Endicted, That where the Parson of the
Church of D. and all his predecessors have used to have Common in such a place;
The said Defendants, Willoughby and others, had enclosed the same, and that
enclosure was upon their own Land.

It was moved, That upon this matter they ought not to have been endicted; but
the party grieved was put to his Action; As, where a presentment is made of a
Disseisin. See 27 Ass. 20. And it was the Case of one Marden, 29 Eliz. upon the
stopping of a Highway upon his own Land; and if it were upon other Land, it
were not material; for it is but an Impeachment to take Common, which cannot be
Vi et armis, etc. Also this Endictment is Recorded and Certified as found
before Justices of Assize and Jail-deliver, and they cannot take such
presentment. And although the Justices of Assize and Jail-deliver were in rei
veritate also Justices of Peace; yet the Endictment being recorded and
certified to be taken before them in quality of Justices of Peace, shall not
help it; for the Court shall not respect any Authority but that which appears
upon the Record. And for these Causes, the parties were discharged.

CCLXXXVI. Gates and Hollywell's Case. Pasch. 30 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
A Man having Issue two Sons, devised, That his eldest Son with his Executors
should take the profits of the Lands, until his younger Son should come to the
age of 22 years; and then the younger Son should have the Lands to him and his
Heirs of his body: It was the clear Opinion of all the Justices, That the
eldest Son should have a Feesimple in the Lands, until the younger Son came to
the said age of 22 years.

CCLXXXVII. Cony and Beveridge's Case. Mich. 30 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
2 Len. 146.
IN Debt upon an Obligation, the Case was, That the Plaintiff Leased to the
Defendant certain Lands in the County of Cambridge, rendering rent; And
afterward, the Defendant became bounden to the Plaintiff in an Obligation for
the payment of the said Rent: upon which Bond, the Plaintiff brought an Action
of Debt in the County of Northampton. To which the Defendant pleaded payment of
the Rent, without showing the place of payment, and upon that they were at
Issue. And it was found by Nisi prius, in the County of Northampton for the
Plaintiff; It was moved in Arrest of Judgment, That the Issue is mis-tryed; for
here the payment of the Rent being pleaded, without showing the place of
payment, it shall be intended, that the Rent was paid upon the Land, which is
in the County of Cambridge, and there the Issue ought to be tried. See 44 E. 3.
42.

And it was the Opinion of Anderson Chief Justice, That no Judgment should be
given for the Plaintiff, for the Cause aforesaid.

But Rhodes and Windam Justices, were of a contrary Opinion; For it does not
appear, That the Issue is mis-tryed, because that no place of payment is
pleaded, and it may be, for any thing that is showed, That the Rent was not
paid in the County of Northampton.

CCLXXXVIII. The Blacksmith's Case. Mich. 30 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
A Blacksmith of South Mimmes, in the County of Middlesex, took an Obligation
of another Blacksmith of the same Town, upon Condition that he should not
exercise the Trade or Art of a Blacksmith within the same Town, nor within a
certain precinct of the same. And upon that Obligation, the Obligee brought an
Action of Debt in the Common Pleas; depending which Suit, the Obligor
complained to the Justices of Peace of the County against the Obligee, upon
which the matter being found against him by Examination, the Justices committed
the Obligee to Prison; and now, upon the whole matter, Puckering Sergeant
prayed a Habeas Corpus for the said Obligee to the Sheriff of Middlesex, and
hat it. And Fleetwood Recorder of London being at the Bar, the Court openly
admonished him of that matter; For by the Law, Justices of Peace have not
Conusans of such Offenses, nor can entermeddle with them; for their power is
limited by the Commission, and the Statutes. And the Recorder relied much upon
the Opinion of Hull. in 2 H. 5. 5. But it was said by the Court, Although that
this Court be a high Court to punish such Offenses appearing before them of
Record; yet it does not follow, That the Justices of Peace may also do so: But
as to the Obligation it self, the Court was clear of Opinion, That the same was
void, and against the Law.

CCLXXXIX. Russell and Broker's Case. Mich. 30 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
2 Len. 209.
IN Trespass, for cutting down of 4 Oaks; The Defendant pleaded, That the place
where, etc. And that he is seized of a Message in D. and that he, and all
those whose Estate he has, etc. habere Consueverant rationabile estoverium
suum for fuel, ad Libitum suum Capiendum in boscis, subboscis and arboribus
ibidem crescentibus, and that in Quolibet tempore anni, unless in Fawning time.
The Plaintiff by Replication said, That the place where is in the Forest of D.
etc. And that the Defendant, and all those whose Estate, etc. habere
Consueverunt rationabile estoverium suum de Boscis, etc. per Liberationem
Forestarii, aut ejus Deputati, prout Boscus pati potuit, and non ad exigentiam
petentis, And upon that Replication, the Defendant demurred in Law. And it was
the clear Opinion of the Court, That Judgment should be given against the
Plaintiff: For if he would have ousted the Defendant of his Prescription by the
Law of the Forest, he ought to have showed the Law of the Forest in such
Case: Lex forestae talis est; For the Law of the Forest, is not the Common Law
of the Land; and we are not bounden to take notice of it, but it ought to be
pleaded; Or else the Plaintiff ought to have traversed the Prescription of the
Defendant; For here are two Prescriptions, one pleaded by the Defendant by way
of Bar; The other set forth by the Plaintiff in his Replication, without any
traverse of that which is set forth in the Bar, which cannot be good. But if
the Plaintiff had showed in his Replication, Lex forestae talis est, then the
Prescription of the Defendant had been answered without any more; for none can
prescribe against a Statute.

Exception was taken to the Bar, because the Defendant has justified the
cutting down of Oaks, without alleging, That there was not any Underwoods: But
that Exception was not allowed, for he has his Choice, ad libitum suum.

Another Exception was taken to the Bar, because he has not showed, that at
that time of the cutting, it was not Fawning time; Poph. 158. 2 Cro. 637, 679.
for at the Fawning time his prescription does not extend to it, and that was
holden to be a material Exception: but because that the Plaintiff had replied,
and upon his Replication, the Defendant had demurred; the Court would not
resort to the Bar, but gave Judgment upon the Replication, and therefore Nihil
Capiat per breve.

CCXC. Brocas's Case. Mich. 30 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
BRocas, Lord of a Manor, Covenanted with his Copyholder, to assure to him and
his Heirs, the Freehold and Inheritance of his Copyhold; And the said
Copyholder in Consideration of the same performed, Covenanted to pay such a
sum: It was the Opinion of the whole Court, That the said Copyholder is not
tied to pay the said sum, before the assurance made, 1 Roll. 415.
and the Covenant performed: But if the words had been, In Consideration of the
said Covenant to be performed, then he is bounden to pay the money presently;
and to have his remedy over by Covenant.

CCXCI. Ireland and Higgius's Case. Trin. 30 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
IN an Action upon the Case, the Plaintiff declared, Owen Rep. 93.
That he was possessed of a Greyhound ut de bonis suis propriis; and that such
a day he lost it, and that it came to the hands of the Defendant by Trover; and
that the Defendant afterward in Consideration thereof, promised the Plaintiff
to deliver the said Greyhound to the Plaintiff: and showed his request.

Ley, The Action does not lie; For of those things which are ferae naturae, the
Plaintiff has not any property, but ratione fundi, as of Deer, etc. And in
Trespass for them, he cannot say (suos,) but only Quare claufum fregit, and
lepores cepit, without saying (suos.) And to that purpose were cited, 3 H. 6.
56. 18 E. 4. 14. 10 H. 7. 19. 22 H. 6. 12. 14 Eliz. Dyer, 106. Sir John
Spencer's Case. And it was holden, That the Action did not lie; And if not for
a Hawk, much less for a Hound.

CCXCII. Ognell and Trussell's Case. Mich. 30 Eliz. In the Star Chamber.
A Bill was Exhibited in the Star Chamber, by Ognell of London, against one
Trussell of Warwickshire; setting forth such matter, That whereas the said
Trussell had for good Consideration sold and assured unto the said Ognell a
Manor: Now, to gratify a great person who earnestly desired the said Manor,
he for effecting thereof, practiced by fraudulent means to avoid the said
assurance; and practiced by other persons to be Indicted of a Robbery supposed
to be committed before the said Assurance; and compounded with the Lord of the
Fee, that if he be attainted, so that by such Attainder, the said Manor should
escheat to the said Lord, That he upon request should reassure to the said
Trussell the said Manor in Fee after Pardon obtained, which was promised to
him by the said great Parsonage: Upon which Indictment, Trussell was Arraigned,
and Convicted upon Evidence; which he himself procured to be falsely given
against him; And all that was, to extort the Land which was lawfully sold
before. And upon the Bill, Trussell demurred in Law, because he is a person
attainted of Felony, and so dead in Law, and therefore shall not be put to
answer.

Hatton, Lord Chancellor, It is not reason that he be put to Answer, for Nemo
tenetur seipsum prodere: And thereupon the Bill was referred to Anderson and
Periam, Justices, to Consider, If the Defendant should be put to answer, or
not? Who certified unto the Court, That although the Defendant be attainted, ut
supra, and so, quodam modo, dead in Law to all intents; yet in Criminal Causes,
he shall answer, Wherefore it was ordered, That he answer accordingly.

CCXCIII. Cardinal and Arnold's Case. Mich. 30 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
CArdinal brought an Action upon the Case against Arnold, and declared, That
the Dean and Chapter Ecclesiae Cathedralis Cantuar. per nomen Decani and
Capituli Ecclesiae Cathedral. and Metropolitan. Christian. Cantuar. Leased unto
Seckford for years the Manor of Hadley, by force of which he was possessed;
And so possessed, granted to the Plaintiff the Office of Stewardship of the
said Manor, and the Defendant disturbed him. The Defendant pleaded a Lease,
absque hoc, that the said Seckford granted. And it was found for the Plaintiff.

And it was moved in Arrest of Judgment, That that Lease being made in the
manner aforesaid, was void: For, the Declaration is, That the Dean and Chapter
Ecclesiae Cathedralis Cantuar. where the Lease is made by the name, ut supra.
Here are two several Names; therefore two several Corporations, therefore
Decanus and Capituli Ecclesiae Cathedralis Cantuariensis did not Lease; But
Decanus and Capituli Ecclesiae Cathedralis and Metrapolitan. Christi, did Lease.

CCXCIV. Anderson and Hayward's Case. Pasch. 30 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
A Copyholder of Inheritance of a Manor in the hands of the King, is ousted.
It was holden in such case, That he has not gained any Estate, so as he may
make a Lease for years, upon which his Lessee may maintain an Ejectione firmae;
but he has but a possession against all strangers. And also in that Case, It
was holden, That if a Copyholder dies, his Heir within age, he is not bound to
come at any Court during his Nonage, to pray Admittance; Or to tender his
Fine. Also, that if the death of his Ancessor be not presented, nor
proclamation made, he is not at any Mischief, although he be of full age.

CCXCV. Brightman's Case. Pasch. 30 Eliz. In the Exchequer Chamber.
UPon a Writ of Error brought upon a Judgment given in the King Bench; The
matter was, A. Leased for 20 years to B. two Acres of Land, rendering Rent, with
Condition of Re-entry, who Leased one of the said Acres to C. for 10 years; And
afterward, granted the Reversion of the said Term in the said Acre to A. It
was holden by the Justices, That the same was no present suspension of the said
Condition, because there was not any possession.

CCXCVI. Fitzhugh's Case. Hill. 30 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
IN Dower against Fitzhugh who pleaded in bar a Fine with proclamations, and 5
years passed after the death of the Husband, of whose seisin she demanded
Dower. To which the Demandant said, That within the 5 years after the death of
her Husband, she brought a Writ of Dower against the now Tenant, and delivered
the same to the Sheriff, etc. but did not show, that the Writ was Returned;
upon which, the Tenant did demur in Law.

It was holden by Periam, Justice, That the Fine is not avoided by such manner
of Claim; For the words of the Statute are, ( So that they pursue their Claim
or Title by way of Action, or lawful Entry within the 5 years,) but here the
Demandant has not pursued, etc. therefore she shall not be Retained by the
said Statute.

CCXCVII. Mounson and West's Case Mich. 30 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
1 Len. 88.
IN the Case of Mounson and West; which see, in Leon. 1 Part, 88. Where the Case
was in Trespass, the parties were at Issue; and at the Return of the Panel,
the Defendant challenged the Array, because it was made by B.A. who took to
Wife the Cosen German of the Plaintiff, et ex ea had Issue living, the Mother
being dead: Upon which it was demurred in Law. Now this Term came the
Plaintiff, and offered to relinquish his Demurrer, and confess the Cosenage,
and prayed a Writ to the Coroners. It was the Opinion of the Court, That he
might so well do by the Law, because the Demurrer is not made up: Which matter
the Prothonotaries excused, because the Demurrer was not subscribed with a
Sergeants hand.

To which it was said by the Court, That a Demurrer upon a Challenge, is not
like to a Demurrer upon a Plea; For in case of a Demurrer upon a Challenge, as
soon as the Demurrer is agreed upon at the Bar, it is good enough without other
Circumstance, and the Prothonotaries of right ought to enter such Demurrer.

CCXCVIII. Fetherstone and Hutchins's Case. Trin. 30 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
IN an Action upon the Case upon Assumpsit, the Plaintiff declared, That
whereas one Hill had recovered in an Action of Debt against J.S. 10 l. upon
which a Capias was awarded against the said J.S. by force of which the
Plaintiff Arrested him: and so being under his Arrest, the Defendant in
Consideration that the Plaintiff would suffer the said J.S. to go at large,
circa negotia sua, and to go to his own House: And also in Consideration of 2
d. paid to the Defendant, he promised to pay to the Plaintiff the said 10 l.

It was holden by the Court, That the same was a void promise within the
Statute of 23 H. 6. for the Consideration to let the Prisoner go at large, is
not lawful; and if part of the Consideration is naught, so is the whole: And
Adjudged accordingly.

CCXCIX. Gore and Wingfield's Case. Hill. 30 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
IN Debt upon an Obligation; 4 Len. 208
The Obligation was written in this form; Know all by these presents, That I H.
Wingfield, am bound to William Gore, etc. in the sum of, etc. For the payment
of which sum, I give full power and authority to the said Gore, to levy the
said sum upon the profits of the Bailiwick of Swinsted from year to year, until
the same be paid. To which the Defendant pleaded, That the Plaintiff had levied
parcel of the said sum, etc. and did not show how; And therefore the pleading
was found vicious: And it was clearly agreed by the whole Court in this Case,
That the Plaintiff at his Liberty might bring his Action upon the said
Obligation; or levy the said money according to the Clause aforesaid.

CCC. Seckford's Case. Hill. 30 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
HEnry Seckford was impleaded in the Court of Common Pleas at the suit of a
Widow in an Action of Debt, and now came an Injunction or Writ of Privilege
out of the Exchequer, reciting the said Seckford to be one of the Grooms of the
Queens Privy-Chamber, and Keeper of the Privy-Purse, and so Accomptable to the
Queen; and that they do not hold plea of the said Action; But that the
Plaintiff sequitur poenas Scaccar. But the Writ was utterly disallowed by the
Court. See 16 Eliz. Dyer, 328. Hunt's Case.

CCCI. The Queen and Littleton's Case. Trin. 30 Eliz. In the Exchequer.
INstruction by the Queen against Littleton, and upon the general Issue, As to
the House, The Defendant pleaded, Not guilty; and as to the Land and Park made
Title, That Anne Talbot leased the same to him for years, etc. and the Jury
found this special matter, scil. That Anne Talbot was seized, and leased the
said House, Land and Park, to the Defendant for years, rendering Rent, with
clause of Re-entry; And that after the said Lease so made, The said Anne said
to the Lessee, Although I have not excepted it in my Lease, yet I mean to have
the Chamber over the Kitchen to lay my Stuff in, until my Son come of years. To
whom the Lessee answered, That he was well contented with that: Upon which the
said Anne put in her Household Stuff there, and afterward she took to Husband
Sir Robert Stapleton Knight; After which, all the Household Stuff is removed out
of the said Chamber by the said Sir Robert Stapleton and his Wife; who
afterward by their Warrant authorized J.S. to demand the Rent due at
Michaelmas, who at the last day, limited for the payment of the Rent, went to
the Premises, and demanded the Rent; to whom the Lessee said, That if the said
J.S. would show to the Lessee his Name, and make an Acquittance, and also show
his Warrant, he would pay him the Rent, otherwise not; but the said J.S.
utterly refused, etc. wherefore the Lessee would not pay any Rent: And as to
the other Rent (for several Rents were reserved,) The Lessee said to J.S. upon
demand of the same, I here say, That there is already a forfeiture committed
upon the last demand, and therefore it is to no purpose to pay the Rent; and
further said, he had not any moneys. Shep. Touch. 387.
It was moved by Popham Attorney General, That these demands made in manner,
etc. were good; and that he who made the demand, is not bound to show his
Warrant; For he may be sufficiently authorized to make such demand without any
Warrant in writing, no more than to tell his Name, or make an Acquittance; but
the Lessee ought to pay his Rent at his peril, sub conditionis periculo, as in
Case of an Obligation: And as to the Speech of Anne Talbot, concerning the
Chamber over the Kitchen, and the answer of Littleton to that; The same does
not amount unto a Surrender, nor was it their intent, but only a permission, or
sufferance for the said Anne Talbot to lay her Stuff there for a time as
appears; for after the Stuff removed, the Lessee entered into the Chamber, and
occupied the same as he did the rest. And afterward exception was taken to
this Verdict, because that here are two Issues, and but one Verdict, scil. as
to the Land and Park, of Not guilty; and as to the House, he makes a Title by
Lease; and the Jury have found the Lease, the Condition and the Re-entry for
the breach of the same: If the special matter aforesaid does amount to the
same, and if, etc. then they say, that the Defendant is guilty of the whole: It
was moved, That here is but one Verdict for the Lease; and the other Issue is
not enquired of, and then all is discontinued. See 5 H. 5. 3. in Dower, the
Tenant pleaded as to one part, Non tenure, and as to the Residue, Ne unque
seisie; and afterward the Seisin was found by the Verdict, but nothing found
of the Non tenure, and therefore a Venire facias de novo was awarded, etc. But
it was answered by the Court, That this Verdict had determined both the Issues;
for, the Changeableness of the Entry, as the Court conceived upon the special
matter aforesaid, did determine both the Issues.

CCCII. Scot and Scot's Case. Pasch. 31 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
THE Case of Scot and Scot in a Replevin, 1 Cro. 73. 2 Len. 128. 4 Len. 70.
the which see Mich. 29 Eliz. Leon. 2 Part, 129. was argued again by Egerton,
Solicitor General; And he said, In some Case, This word (Proviso) is not a
Condition, but only an Explanation of the Sentence precedent: If it be in the
Negative, and makes restraint of the Common Law, then it is a Condition: As a
Lease for years, Proviso, That he shall not alien, or do Waste. And if the
Proviso be in the Affirmative, and by that the party be bound to do a thing,
which of common Right he is not bound to do, it is a Condition. A Lease for
years, or for life, Proviso, That he shall pay such a sum. Lessee for years,
Proviso, That the Lessee shall pay his Rent generally, without limitation of
any day; it is on Condition. And he held by way of Argument in the principal
Case, That Cestuy que use should take adgantage of conditions, which are knit
to Estates, as for payment of Rent, but not concerning collateral things; And
such exposition of the Statute of 32 H. 8. has been made there before. And
admit it be a Condition, Yet the Lessor cannot re-enter, for the Rent was not
well demanded; For 20 l. Rent is reserved yearly, payable at four Feasts, and
here the Lessor has demanded 10 l. scil. The Rent of two several Quarters,
whereas only Rent was demandable in point of the Condition. Cook conceived,
That it was a Condition; but every Proviso did not make a Condition: The Lessor
Covenants, That the Lessee shall take sufficient Wood, Proviso, that he shall
not take great Timber; that Proviso does not make the Covenant Conditional, but
only explains the same: A Lease without Impeachment of Waste, Proviso, that the
Lessee shall not do voluntary Waste, is not any Proviso, but a restraint of the
Liberty given before, and does but qualify the Liberty: As Littletons Case,
Grant of a Rentcharge, Proviso, that it shall not extend to charge the person
of the Grantor, that Proviso does not make the Grant Conditional, so that, if
the Grantee bring a Writ of Annuity against the Grantor, the Grant be
determined, etc. A Lease for years, Proviso, that if the Lessee shall be
disposed to Alien, that the Lessor shall have the first offer, etc. The same is
not a Condition, which see by Fitzherbert and Baldwin, 28 H. 8. Dyer 13. A
Lease for years upon Condition, That if the Lessee will hold over his Term,
That then he shall pay so much Rent, the same is not Condition, for it is at
the pleasure of the Lessee, etc. and it is not compulsory. A Feoffment in Fee
with warranty, Proviso, that the Feoffee shall not vouch; the same does not
make the warranty Conditional, but only abridgeth the warranty. Sir Richard
Pecksall leased certain Lands for years, and Covenanted, That the Lessee should
take at his pleasure the Trees there growing; Proviso, That he should not take
Trees of such a bigness: It was holden in that Case to be no Condition. So in
the Covenant for further assurance, Proviso, That the Bargainor shall not be
compelled to travail for the making of the assurance above ten miles, etc. But
admit that it be a Condition, yet the Lessor upon the matter cannot take
advantage of it; For he has not demeaned himself in the demand of the Rent as
he ought. For he has demanded Rents due to him at several Quarters; and that
he cannot demand in point of forfeiture, for then the Lessor may leave his Rent
in the Hands of the Lessee until it amount to a great sum of 200 or 300 l. and
then upon a sudden demand of the Rent, when the Lessee is not so well
furnished, nor can be at so short warning, to pay the same. And it may be
likened to the Case in 27 H. 6. A. grants to B. ten Loads of Hay percipiend.
annuatim, out of his Meadows in C. for 21 years: there the Grantee cannot stay
and take all his Hay, and the Arrears of it in the later year; but he ought to
take his Hay every year according to his Grant, Causa qua supra. And although
the Lessor here has demanded more Rent than he ought, yet the Law shall
construe the demand good for so much of the Rent, which by the Law is
demandable in point of forfeiture; as where a Man is bound to perform the Award
of such an one; who awards, That he and another shall be bound to another party
for the payment of, etc. Although that the same Award be void as to the
Stranger, yet it is good as to the party himself, and he ought to be bound by
it. Dr. Mollins Case, A Lease for years rendering Rent to be paid at two days in
the year; Proviso, That if the said Lessee do not pay the said yearly Rent,
that then a Re-entry; that Rent is not demandable upon pain of forfeiture, but
the last day of every year only, and not every year according to the
Reservation of it. The words of our Condition are; Provided, That if the Lessee
do grant his Term to his eldest Son, that he shall pay but so must Rent, the
same without doubt is not any Condition; yet [he shall pay so much Rent] does
amount to so much. Note, In the Argument of this, this Case was put, A. is
bound to make such an assurance to B. of such Land as C. shall devise; C.
devises, That A. and his Wife shall make such assurance, A. is bounden upon
the peril of his Obligation to do it. See as to this point of the Proviso, 5
Eliz. Dyer 222. The Archbishop of Yorks Case: It was adjourned.

CCCIII. Mich. 31 Eliz. In C. B.
THis Case was put to the Court, a Copyholder did allege the Custom of the
Manor to be, That the Lord of the Manor might grant Copies in the remainder,
only with the assent of the Tenants, and not otherwise, and that Copies in
Remainder otherwise granted should be void: It was demanded of the Court, If
this were a good Custom or not; The Justices did forbear to deliver any Opinion
in the Case: Walmesley Sergeant, That it was a void Custom; for that the Law
does not take notice of Copyholders Estate, they being but Tenants at Will, in
the Judgment of the Common Law; and therefore it was not reasonable, that their
Wills and Pleasures should limit the Lord of the Manor in granting of Estates
by Copy, and therefore he said, such a Custom was void; and he compared it to
the Case in 2 H. 4. 27. That a Custom, That a Commoner shall not use his Common
before that the Lord has put in his Cattle, was holden to be a void Custom; On
the other side, It was said, That this Custom might have a lawful beginning,
and that it might be grounded upon the reason of the Common Law, That a
Remainder should not be without the assent of the particular Tenant, and
therefore that the Custom might be good; And it was said, That Wife should not
have her Dower, unless she claimed it within a year and a day; that the same
was adjudged to be a good Custom: The Court delivered no Opinion in the Case;
but the Case was adjourned to another time.

CCCIV. Mich. 31 Eliz. In C. B.
THE Case was, a Man devised Socage Lands to his Brothers Son in tail, to have
the same at his age of 25 years, and died, having Issue a Daughter: The Nephew
after 21 years entered, and levied a Fine, and afterward accomplished his age
of twenty five years. It was the Opinion of the whole Court, That the Issue of
the Devisee was barred by this Fine. For the Heir in Tail, and the Heir in Fee,
are all one by the Statute of 4 H. 7. And it was holden, That this was not a
Fine which does enure by way of Estoppel; but that it passes the very right:
It was said to be the same Law, If one who has but a condition levyeth a Fine,
and afterward enters for the condition broken, etc.

CCCV. Palmer and Smalbrook's Case. Hill. 31 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
IN an Action upon the Case, The Plaintiff declared, 1 Len. 132. Owen 97. 1
Cro. 178.
That the Defendant had recovered a certain Debt against one A. and thereupon
took forth a Capias against the said A. to Arrest his Body, and delivered the
said Capias to the Plaintiff, being then Sheriff, and prayed a Warrant for the
serving of the Capias, and that he would name to him one B. for a special
Bailiff, and promised the Plaintiff, That if B. Arrested A. by force of the
said Capias, and suffered him to escape, that he would not sue him for the said
escape; and further declared, That he made a Warrant according to the said
Capias, and therein named and appointed the said B. his special Bailiff, who
Arrested A. accordingly, and afterward suffered him to escape; and that the
Defendant notwithstanding his Promise aforesaid, sued the Plaintiff for the
said escape, and it was found for the Plaintiff: And it was moved in stay of
Judgment, That that Promise was against the Law, to prevent the punishment
inflicted by the Statute of 23 H. 8. upon the Sheriff, and that it is merely
within the said Statute, and so the Promise void. Cook, This is not any Bond or
Promise taken of the Prisoner, nor of any for him; and therefore it is not
within the Statute, and it was Davies Case: Wray, A Promise is within the
Statute as well as a Bond. But the Statute does not extend, but where the Bond
or Promise is made by the Prisoner, or by some for him; And afterward,
Judgment was given for the Plaintiff.

CCCVI. Wood and Payn's Case. Trin. 31 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
IN an Ejectione firmae, for. Entry into a Message sive Tenementum, and 4
Acres of Lands to the same belonging: Upon not guilty pleaded, it was found for
the Plaintiff. It was moved by Cowper, Sergeant, That the Declaration is
uncertain, Messuagium sive Tenementum, quod fuit Concessum. Cook, We will
release our damages. Kemp, Then your Costs are gone also. Cowper, You cannot
have Judgment of the 4 Acres; For the Declaration is 4 Acres to the said
Message or Tenement belonging, and for the incertainty to which thing
belonging. But to that it was said, That as to the 4 Acres, it is certain
enough; For the words, To the same belonging, are merely void. And afterward
the Plaintiff released damages, and had Judgment.

CCCVII. Bennington and Bennington's Case. Trin. 31 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
BEnnington brought an Action of Trespass against Bennington, for breaking of
his Close, etc. The Defendant pleaded, That long time before the Trespass
supposed, That it was the Freehold of one Joan Bennington, and that he as her
servant, and by her Commandment entered; upon which they were at Issue. And it
was found, That for two parts of the Land where, etc. in three parts to be
divided, it was the Freehold of the Plaintiff; and for the other part, that it
was the Freehold of the Defendant: and by the clear Opinion of the whole Court,
The Plaintiff could not have Judgment, for now it appears, That the Plaintiff
and Defendant are Tenants in Common, betwixt whom an Action of Trespass does
not lie; and although this Tenancy in Common be not pleaded, but found by
Verdict; yet it was the Opinion of the Court, That it is all one.

CCCVIII. Brereton and Auser's Case. Hill. 31 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
JOhn Brereton of the Inner Temple, brought a Writ of Error against Auser, to
Reverse an Outlawry; And the Case was, That the said Auser had caused the said
Brereton to be endicted, upon the Statute of Magna Charta, and diverse other
Statutes; For that, Whereas the said Auser had sued the said Brereton in a Bill
of Debt in the Court of Request against the said Brereton; and by the said Suit
procured the said Brereton to be imprisoned; Upon which Endictment, Brereton
was Outlawed; And Error was assigned in the Outlawry, because whereas the
Endictment was taken in Middlesex, the Exigent upon it was in London; whereas
it ought to issue out of Middlesex; but the proclamations issued in the County
whereof he was named Nuper; and that was peremptory, for if he make default
upon that Process, he shall encur the danger of a Praemunire: And for that
cause, the Outlawry was reversed. Also, the party was discharged of the
Endictment; for this Suit in the Court of Requests, as it appears upon the
Endictment, was before Judgment in the Bill of Debt.

CCCIX. Constable and Farrer's Case. Hill. 31 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
IN an Action upon the Case upon an Assumpsit, the Plaintiff declared, That
whereas the Defendant had brought an Action against him, the Issue in which
ought to be tried at the next Assizes at N. the Defendant in Consideration that
the now Plaintiff should confess the Action aforesaid at the Assizes holden the
4th of August, promised that he would stand to the Arbitrament of J.S. for the
said matter: And upon Non Assumpsit, the Jury found That the Defendant made
such a Promise the 5th of August, but not the 4th of August.

Cook, I conceive, That upon this Verdict the Plaintiff shall have Judgment;
for in truth the Assizes began the 4th of August; and the Consideration was,
That the now Plaintiff should confess the Action at the same Assizes; which
although they continue diverse days, yet in Law, all is but one day; And all the
Assizes shall be said to be holden the 4th of August: so as of necessity, we
must lay the promise accordingly. And it is a clear case, That the Plaintiff in
an Action upon the Case, shall declare upon a Promise the first day of May; And
if it be found, that it was made at another day, yet the Plaintiff shall
recover.

CCCX. Hamper's Case. Mich. 31 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
2 Len. 211. 1 Cro. 147.
HAmper was Endicted upon the Statute of 5 Eliz. of Perjury; And in the body of
the Endictment, the Record was, that he falso and deceptive deposuit: Whereas
the Statute speaks (Wilfully;) And although in the perclose of the Endictment,
the Conclusion is, Et sic commisit voluntarium perjurium: Yet the Opinion of
the Court was, That the same did not help the matter; and for that cause the
party was discharged: For contra formam Statuti, will not help the matter; and
yet it was moved and urged, that contra formam Statuti did supply such defect.
And in this case, It was holden by the Court, That if a Witness deposes
falsely, but the Jury do not give credit to his Oath, but give their Verdict
against his Oath, although the party grieved cannot sue him for the Perjury;
yet at the Suit of the King, he shall be punished.

CCCXI. Collet and Robston's Case. Trin. 31 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
Ante 149.192. 2 Len. 118.
ARthur Collet and Thomas Andrews recovered against Robston in a Writ of
Account, Hill. 29 Eliz. And now Robston brought a Writ of Error, and assigned
for Error, That whereas the said Writ of Account was brought against the
Defendant as Receivor of moneys to render Account quando ad hoc requisitus
fuerit, the said Writ ought to have been more special: But the Writ in its
generalty was holden good enough without any special matter. And so it was
adjudged in the Case of one Gomersell; scil. Quod reddat ei rationabilem
Computum suum de tempore quo fuit Receptor Denariorum ipsius A. Another Error
was assigned; For that the Jury had assessed damages, which ought not to be
done in an Action of Account. Which see, 2 Ric. 2. Fitz. Account, 45. and 2 H.
7. 13. But see the Book of Entries, 22. In a Writ of Account against one as
Receivor, for to render Account, damages were given by the Jury for the
Plaintiff: And in the Case of an Account against one as Bailiff, damages shall
be given: For if my Bailiff by the employment of my moneys whereof he was
Receivor, might have procured profit and gain unto me, but he neglects the
same, he shall be chargeable to me to answer the same. And here in our Case,
damages shall be given ratione implacitationis. And afterward, notwithstanding
the Exceptions, the Judgment was affirmed.

CCCXII. Yates's Case. Trin. 31 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
YAtes and another brought a Writ of Error upon a Judgment given in a Writ of
Partition; and assigned for Error, 2 Len. 118.
That the Partition was not sufficient; For it is there set forth, That the
Plaintiffs insimul and pro indiviso tenent cum defendente, etc. and does not
say what Estate. See F.N.B. 61 and 62. Insimul et pro indiviso tenent de
haereditate, which was of A. matris of the Plaintiff and Defendant. And yet see
F. N. B. 62. A Writ of Partition betwixt strangers, without naming de
haereditate in the Writ. 1 Cro. 759, 760.
And see also, that Partitions of Lands in London, without showing of what
Estate. See Register, 67. 6 Eliz. in Partitione facienda by Courtney against
Polyweel, no Estate showed in the Writ. 26 Eliz. Between the Lord Cheney and
Bell. So between Finch and Tirrell; And so between Fry and Drake, 14 Eliz. And
4 and 5 Phil. and Mary, It was holden, That it is not necessary in such Writ to
show the Estate: But Tenants in Common ought to show the same in their
Declaration.

CCCXIII. Hill. 31 Eliz. In the King Bench.
AN Action upon the Case was brought for these words, scil. Thou have forged my
hand: It was holden by Gaudy and Wray, Justices, That such words are not
actionable, because too general, without showing to what writing: And by Wray,
these words, scil. Thou art a forger, are not actionable, because it is not to
what thing he was a forger.

Godfery, Between Warner and Cropwell; scil. She went about to kill me; An
Action lies for them: for if they were true, she should be bounden to the good
behavior.

And by Gaudy, for these words, scil. Thou have forged a Writing; They are not
Actionable, because they are uncertain words: Which Wray, concessit: But if the
Declaration had been more certain, as (innuendo) such a deed, then it had been
good enough.

Fuller, A Case was betwixt Brook and Doughty; scil. He has Counterfeited my
Lord of Leicester's hand unto a Letter against the Bishop of London; for the
which he was committed to the Marshalsey for it. And it was holden, Not
Actionable. And afterward, in the principal Case, Judgment was, Nihil Capiat
per Billam.

CCCXIV. Delabroche and Barney's Case. Mich. 31 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
DElabroche was sued in the Admiral Court, upon an Obligation supposed to be
made and delivered in France; and now he prayed a Prohibition. It was holden by
the whole Court, That such a Bond might be sued here: but being begun in the
Court of Admiralty, we cannot prohibit them; for that perhaps, the Witnesses of
the Plaintiff are beyond Sea; which may be examined there, but not here.

CCCXV. Moulton's Case. Mich. 31 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
THis Case was moved to the Court by Cook, That one Robert Moulton Tenant in
tail, having Issue two Sons, Robert and John, died seized; And that Robert his
Son and Heir, levied a Fine thereof; and afterward levied another Fine, and
died without Issue. And John brought two several Writs of Error, to reverse
both Fines: And the Tenant to the Writ of Error brought upon the first Fine,
pleaded the second Fine in bar of it: And in her of a Writ of Error brought
upon the second Fine, he pleaded the first Fine. The Court advised him to
Reply, That the Fine pleaded in bar, was erroneous. See 7 H. 4. 107. Where a
Man is to annul an Outlawry, his person shall not be disabled by any other
Outlawry.

CCCXVI. Babington and Babington's Case. Mich. 31 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
IN Debt brought, The Defendant pleaded an Attachment made in London after
imparlance. It was adjudged, That it was not any plea. And Wray said, That the
same should be observed for a Rule in other Cases. After that plea was
disallowed; The Defendant pleaded Variance betwixt the Obligation and the
Declaration; For the Obligation was Randal Bab. And the Declaration was ad
respondend. Randulpho B. alias Randal B.

Cook said, That Randulphus, is Latin for Randal. Owen, Sergeant, showed
diverse Presidents, where Randulphus was taken for Randal. But the Court did not
agree upon it.

Wray advised the Plaintiff for his more speed to bring a new Writ. But Gaudy
said, That the Writ brought was good enough.

CCCXVII. Pike and Hassen's Case. Mich. 31 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
AN Action upon the Statute of 32 H. 8. touching buying of Titles; And the
Bargain was laid in Norfolk; but the Land, etc. was in Suffolk; And the Issue
was tried in Norfolk, and the value of the Land also: And as to the 5 Acres
they found the Defendant guilty; and found also the value of them: And for the
Residue, a Special Verdict was given; and for the 5 Acres, the Plaintiff had
Judgment presently: And by the special Verdict it was found, That the Defendant
had occupied the Residue of the Land for two years before, etc. as Tenant at
sufferance; and afterward sold the Inheritance.

Wray, Chief Justice, Tenant at sufferance is in truth a Tort feasor, by which
his taking of the profits is not such as is intended by the Statute: But yet he
afterward looking into the words of the Verdict, which were, That the
Defendant tenuit the Lands for two years ex permissione of another; thereupon
it ought to be intended, That he was Tenant at will.

CCCXVIII. Sparry and Warfield's Case. Mich. 31 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
IN False Imprisonment against the Defendant and others; they pleaded, The
Charter of Bridewell; and that the Plaintiff was mali nominis and famae, and
that certain Goods were stolen from J.S. and upon search, the Plaintiff was
found suspitiously, etc. And that thereupon they put him into Bridewell. It was
the Opinion of the Justices, That the Plea was not good.

CCCXIX. Bragg's Case. Pasch. 32 Eliz. Rot. 318. In the Kings Bench.
IN an Action of Trespass by Strait against Bragg, Quare Clausum fregit,
containing one Acre in C. in the County of H. and for the taking of a Horse.
The Defendant pleaded, That long time before the Trespass, The Dean and Chapter
of Paul's were seized of the Manor of C. in the said County, in Fee in the
right of their Church, whereof the place where is parcel, etc. And so seized,
King E. 4th by his Letters Patents dated Anno 1 of his Reign, granted to them
all the Fines pro Licentia Concordandi of all their Homagers and Tenants
resiants, or not resiants, within their Fee; And showed, That for all that time
they have used to have such Fines of their Tenants: And showed further, That,
29 Eliz. A Fine was levied in the Common Pleas between the Plaintiff and one A.
of 11 Acres of Land, whereof the place where the Trespass was done was parcel,
and the Post-Fine assessed to 15 s. And afterward Scambler the foreign
Opposer allowed to them the said 15 s. because the said Land was within their
Fee; and afterward in the behalf of the said Dean and Chapter, he demanded of
the Plaintiff the said 15 s. who refused to pay it, for which he, by the
Commandment, and in the right of the Dean and Chapter, entered and took the said
Horse in the name of a Distress as Bailiff to the said Dean and Chapter for the
said 15 s. and afterward sold it, etc. upon which the Plaintiff did demur in
Law; And it was moved, That here it is not averred, That the Land whereof the
Fine was levied was within their Fee; but they say, That Scambler allowed it
because it was within their Fee. And that is not a sufficient averment quod
curia concessit: And also the opinion of the Court was, Ante 56. 2 Len. 179.
That the Dean and Chapter cannot distrain for this matter, but they ought to
sue for the same in the Exchequer, as it appears, 9 H. 6. 27. in the Duchess
of Summersets Case.

Gaudy Justice, The Grant does not extend to the Post-Fine; for the Fine pro
licentia Concordandi, is the Kings Silver, and not the Post-Fine.

Wray Justice, All passes by it; for it is about one and the same matter; And
they in Opinion, to have given Judgment for the Plaintiff. Quaere of it.

CCCXX. South and Marsh's Case. Mich. 32 Eliz. In the Exchequer.
NOte: It was holden by the Court, That where Marsh was endebted unto South,
without any Obligation for it, but only by a Note in writing signed with the
Hand of Marsh; scil. By me, W. Marsh; but not sealed, that such a debt might be
assigned to the Queen; although that before the Assignment against a Creditor
he might have waged his Law; for, in as much as by these Notes and Bills the
certainty of the debt appears, and being true debts, they may well be
assigned. See 21 H. 7. 9. An Obligation may be assigned to the Queel. without
Deed enrolled; and where the Obligee is not endebted to the Queen: But it
cannot be assigned to a subject, Noy 52.
if not for a debt due by the Assignor to the Assignee; for otherwise it is
Maintenance. And in this Case it was holden, That where the King sues for a
debt assigned to him, the Obligor cannot plead Nihil debet; for now by the
Assignment it is become matter of Record.

CCCXXI. Trapp's Case. Mich. 32 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
RObert Trapps, 1 Eliz. seized of 15 Messuages in Clarkenwell, in the
Occupation of 15 several persons; viz. A.B.C. etc. and named them certain,
demised them to one Cox; And afterward, conveyed the Inheritance of them to
one Brian Trapps, in Fee; who afterward demised to J.S. all those 15 Messuages
in Clarken-well, which Robert Trapps did demise inter alia to Cox by Indenture
dated 1 Eliz. now in the Occupation of A.B.C. etc. And one of the Occupiers
names was left out in the recital: And it was holden by the whole Court, That
notwithstanding the said Omission, the said Message did pass; for there was
sufficient certainty before; and the falsity came after the verity.

CCCXXII. Brewin and Mansfield's Case. Mich. 32 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
IN an Action upon the Case, the Plaintiff declared, That A. was endebted to
him in 10 l. and made the Defendant his Executor, and died; And that the
Defendant in Consideration, that the Plaintiff would forbear the Defendant for
a certain time, promised to pay it at two several days, and showed which in
certain. And it was found for the Plaintiff. It was moved in Arrest of
Judgment, That it is not set down in the Declaration, by what portions the 10
l. shall be paid.

Clench, Justice, conceived, That the Defendant had liberty to pay it in what
portions he pleased.

Gaudy, He ought to pay it by equal portions, as a Rent reserved payable at two
Feasts, without saying by what portions it shall be paid. And he said, That if
the plea for the cause aforesaid had been defective; yet now after Verdict all
is helped, for it is but form. And afterward, the Opinion of the whole Court
was, That the matter showed was not good to stay Judgment. Wherefore the
Plaintiff had Judgment to recover.

CCCXXIII. Mich. 32 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
THe Case was; The Plaintiff in a Second Deliverance is Nonsuit, and a Writ
awarded to enquire of the damages, and returned; And the Defendant had a Writ
de Retorno habendo; upon which the Sheriff returned Quae averia elongata: upon
which, a Withernam is awarded; By which all the other Cattle of the Plaintiffs
were delivered to the Defendant: And after a years time, the Plaintiff came
into Court, and paid the damages and Costs recovered against him. And the
Opinion of the Court was, That he should have a special Writ to the Sheriff,
reciting the whole matter, to restore the Plaintiff his Goods taken in
Withernam, without any allowance for the keeping in the mean time; For it is
intended, that their labor, or other profits by them, does countervail such
charge. 1 Len. 220.
And Brooker, Prothonotary, said, That he had a President to that purpose, of
12 Eliz.

CCCXXIV. Dalton and Selby's Case. Mich. 32 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
UPon an Attachment removed out of London, a Procedendo was prayed; And the
Case was, That one Brooks was endebted to Dalton, and Selby was endebted as
much unto Brooks: Dalton attached the Debt in the hands of Selby, and the Debt
of Brooks was not yet due. And it was said, That that Debt not being yet due,
was not Attachable by the Custom; For Dalton could not affirm a Plaint of Debt
against Brooks, before that the Debt was due; But if the principal Debt had
been due, Dalton might have attached the said Debt that Selby owed to the said
Brooks, although that Debt was not due. And such was the Opinion of the whole
Court. See 21 E. 4. 67. 22 E. 4. 30, 31. 22 H. 6. 47.

CCCXXV. Mead and Bigott's Case. Mich. 32 and 33 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
IN an Action upon the Case by Mead against Bigott, the Plaintiff declared,
That W. Arnold had levied a Plaint of Debt in the Court of the Manor of
Stepney against Stokes; And whereas the said Arnold had procured a Warrant
directed to the Plaintiff being Bailiff of the Manor, and Minister of the said
Court, to attach the said Stokes by his Goods to answer to the said Arnold at
such a Court, etc. And whereas by virtue of the said Warrant, the Plaintiff had
attached the said Stokes by two Quarters of Wheat, being the Goods of the said
Stokes, to answer the said Arnold in the said Plaint: And whereas the Plaintiff
had delivered the said Wheat to Jane, Wife of the said Arnold, to keep until
the next Court: The Defendant in Consideration thereof, promised to save the
Plaintiff harmless concerning the said Corn. And it was holden, That here is
not any Consideration: For it is against Law, for such an Officer in such a
Case to deliver a thing attached, ut supra, to the Plaintiff or to his Wife.
Also the Consideration was a thing executed before the promise: Also a Man
cannot be attached by Corn. And afterward Judgment was given against the
Plaintiff.

CCCXXVI. Broughton and Prince's Case. Mich. 32 and 33 Eliz. In the Exchquer.
BRoughton, an Apprentice of the Inner Temple, 1 Cro. 728. Trial per pays 175
Owen Rep. 128, 227.
being Farmor to the Queen, exhibited a Bill in the Exchequer, Quo minus, etc.
against Prince, a Practicer of the Law in the Marches of Wales, for maintaining
one J.S. in a Suit, against the Statute of Maintenance.

To which the Defendant pleaded, That he was Consiliarius and in lege eruditus,
etc. and so justified. And now it was moved by Atkinson, on the part of the
Defendant, That by the Statute of 18 Eliz. Cap. 5. That no Informer shall sue
any person upon any Penal Statute, but by way of Information, or Original
Action, and not otherwise, And here the suit is by Bill, which cannot be
warranted by the Statute. And he conceived, That this suit is brought upon the
Statute of 1 R. 2. cap. 4. upon which Statute, no prosecution shall be in the
name of the subject only, but it may be in the name of the King only. See the
Book of Entries, 393. Where the suit is, tam pro Domino Rege, quam pro seipso:
And there by the King only, and there by the party only. And as to the Statute
of 32 H. 8. cap. 9. suit upon the same ought to be, tam pro Domina Regina, quam
pro seipso: Which see in the Book of Entries, 395. Also by the Statute of 31
Eliz. cap. 5. The suit brought, ought to begin within one year after the
offense committed: And in our Case, the offense upon which the suit is
conceived, was committed 3 years before the Information brought; and it cannot
be added, because that the Plaintiff is the party grieved; For every Statute
made against Maintenance is Popular.

Broughton said, We have Replied to the Defendant, That he is a Lay Man, et non
in Lege Eruditus; and prayed, that the same might be enquired of by the
Country: And the Defendant Prince likewise, and so Issue is joined: And because
you have such Objections, they shall be saved to you to move in Arrest of
Judgment.

Atkinson, I may offer them as well now to the Jury, as well as in Arrest of
Judgment. And afterward it was moved, That the Defendant might demur upon the
Replication, if he would; and if not, the Issue should be tried: And if then it
pass against the Defendant, that then he show the matter in Arrest of Judgment;
for no Exception shall be allowed for staying of the Enquest, if it be not an
apparent fault, and not only a doubt.

At another day the matter was moved; and then it seemed to the Barons, That
the Plaintiff here being Pars gravata, was not restrained to any year after the
offense committed, but that restraint did extend only to Common Informers. The
Defendant pleaded, That he was admitted in Societatem interioris Templi, and
there remained a Student for so many years; And that he was homo eruditus in
Lege, and a Counselor, and took his Fee; etc. The Plaintiff by Replication,
said of his own wrong without that, that the Defendant is homo Conciliarius and
in lege eruditus, and hoc petit quod, etc. ut supra. And Atkinson took
Exception to the Traverse and Conclusion of it, Et hoc petit quod inquiratur
per Patriam; for that cannot be tried by the Country, but by the Judges: For
here is a Question of the Learning of the Defendant, and that is to be tried:
and his sufficiency in this Learning is to be discerned by those who are
skilful in the Laws of the Land; For if a matter in Law is to be tried by the
Judges, a multo fortiori, the Learning of the Law is to be tried by them; for
that is more difficult to be judged. As, where the Ordinary refuses a Clerk
for insufficiency in learning, upon which they are at Issue, the same shall not
be tried by the Country, but by the Bishop: Which see Articuli Cleri, cap. 13.
de Idonietate praesentata ad Beneficium Ecclesiasticum pertinet Examinatio ad
Judicium Ecclesiasticum, 40 E. 3. 25. And see the Statute of 18 Eliz. that Pars
gravata in the Case of Maintenance, is not tied to a year. And this suit is
conceived to be in such Quality, being a private grievance to the party
himself; the King not being party, but only the party grieved: But where the
penalty is expressly given to the King, and him that shall sue, there all the
proceedings ought to be in both their names.

And Manwood, Chief Baron, said, That this Issue shall be tried by the Country.
Which see in the Book of Entries, 396.

CCCXXVII. Owen Morgan's Case. Mich. 32 and 33 Eliz. In the Exchequer.
OWen Morgan Exhibited an Information upon the Statute of Usury, for an
usurious Mortgage made; and charged the Defendant, That Cepit ultra 10 l. in
Cl. for the forbearance for one year, and that was out of the Issues, Rents,
and Profits which he took in Middlesex, of Lands in Glamorganshire in Wales
Mortgaged to the Defendant.

Manwood, Chief Baron said, That one might take the Rents of Lands in Wales in
the County of Middlesex, but a Man cannot take the Issues and Profits of the
Lands, but where the Lands are: And Leak 's Case was cited, Where an
Information was brought for cutting down of Wood, and converting it into Coals:
And Leak the Informer laid the cutting to be in the County where the Wood grew,
but the Conversion of it into Coals in the County of Middlesex.

And Manwood said in the principal case, That the taking of the Issues and
Profits ought to have been laid where the Land was. And such was the Opinion
of the whole Court.

CCCXXVIII. Curson's Case. Mich. 32 and 33 Eliz. In the Exchequer.
CUrson acknowledged a Statute to Starkey, 4 Len. 10. Ante 239.
Alderman of London; and afterward he acknowledged another Statute to one
Hampden, who assigned the same to Fitton, who assigned the same to the Queen:
Starkey sued forth Execution upon his Statute; and thereupon the Land is
extended of Curson; and he has a Liberate of it. It was agreed by all the
Barons, That if Starkey had execution upon the Statute before the Queen, his
Execution should stand against the Queen, and the Queen should not put him out.
And it was further agreed by them, That if A. recovers a Debt in the Common
Pleas, so as he has title to sue forth Execution by Elegit, and the Defendant
sells his Lands, and afterward A. assigns his Execution to the Queen, That the
Queen should not have prerogative against the Feoffee to have execution of the
whole Land.

And it was also holden by Manwood, Chief Baron, That if Execution be had upon
a puisne Statute, and the same is afterward avoided by more ancient Statute;
and afterward, the ancient Statute is satisfied, That now the puisne
Recognisee may re-enter without suing forth any new Execution.

CCCXXIX. Butler and Lightfoot's Case. Mich. 32 and 33 Eliz. In the Exchquer.
IN this Case, It was holden by the Barons, 4 Len. 9.
That if Tenant for life be of a Copyhold, the Remainder over in Fee to
another, he in the Remainder may surrender his Estate, if there be not any
particular Custom to the contrary; for, the Estate of Tenant for life and him
in the remainder, are but one Estate; and the admittance of the particular
Tenant, is the admittance also of him in the Remainder.

CCCXXX. Knight and Norton's Case. Mich. 32 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
IT was holden in this Case, That duress of Imprisonment is not intended but
where the party is wrongfully imprisoned until he make the Bond; and not where
a Man is lawfully imprisoned for another cause, and for his delivery he makes a
Bond; for that is not per duritiam imprisonamenti; And if in such Case duresse
be pleaded, the other may say of his own accord sine duritia imprisonamenti,
without saying absque hoc, that it was per duritiam imprisonamenti. And so it
was also holden in the Kings Bench. See 4 E. 4. 17. 12 E. 4. 7.

CCCXXXI. Hungate and Hall's Case. Trin. 32 Eliz. In the Exchequer.
Ante 239. 4 Len. 10.
THe Case was, Curson acknowledged a Statute to Alderman Starkey, and afterward
acknowledged another to Hampdem, which was assigned to the Queen; Afterward,
the Lands of Curson were extended for Starkey, and a Liberate thereof. It was
holden by the Court, That the same was a good Execution, and that the Queen
should not avoid it: But if the Land had been extended at the suit of the
Queen, then the Execution of the Queen should hold place, although it were a
Statute of a puisne date.

And by Clark, Baron, If a Recognizance acknowledged by a Subject be assigned
to the Queen, It has been a Question, If all the Lands of the Conusor shall be
extended, or but the moiety, as it shall be at the suit of the Conusee himself?
It was holden, That all the Lands should be extended.

CCCXXXII. The Lord Gray's Case. Trin. 32 Eliz. In the Exchequer.
THe Lord Gray, Tenant of the King of Lands holden in Capite by License of the
King, made a Feoffment of the Lands in Fee, and afterward levied a Fine for
further assurance: And upon Process, the party came into the Court, and showed
this matter: And the party was advised by the Court to aver, That the said Fine
was for further assurance: And then upon such averment, he should be discharged
without any Pardon sued forth for the Fine, etc.

CCCXXXIII. Sir Walter Waller's Case. Trin. 32 Eliz. In the Exchequer.
IN Sir Walter Waller's Case, It was holden in the Court of Exchequer, That a
Debt of Record, as upon a Judgment, etc. could not be attached by the Custom of
London. 1 Len. 29.
And so it was holden in the Case of Sir John Perrot, in the Common Pleas.

4 Len. 44.
And it was said by Cook, That such a debt could not be assigned upon the
Statute of Bankrupts.

CCCXXXIV. Sir Brian Tucke's Case. Mich. 32 Eliz. In the Exchequer.
IN this Case, It was holden by all the Barons clearly, Office of Executors,
232. Roll. 920. Savile 40.
That the Executor of an Executor should not be charged with a Devastavit made
by the Executor of the first Testator, no not in the Case of the King, because
it is a personal wrong only.

CCCXXXV. Fines and the Lord Dacre's Case. Mich. 32 Eliz. In the Exchequer.
THe Case was; Tenant in tail, Post. 261. 4 Len. 97.
the Remainder of Lands in chief, levied a Fine of them without License of the
King; and, if the Tenants of the Lord Dacres should be charged for the Fine,
was argued: For the Case was, That the Lord Dacres was Tenant in tail, the
Remainder in tail to Philip Fines. And it was holden by all the Barons, That
the Tenants Lands should be discharged: But it was holden, That if the Conusor
had any other Lands within England, the Fine might be levied thereupon; But
then the Question was, If the Tenants should be put to plead the same in
discharge, or that the same should be discharged without pleading; because it
appears upon Record, That he who aliened was but Tenant in tail, in
Remainder: For there was an Office found of that which was pleaded by another
in another Cause. The Opinion of the Court was, Where such matter appears of
Record; as by Office, Livery, etc. there the party needs not to plead such
matter in discharge; for the pleading of it is to no other purpose, but to
satisfy the Court by the Record, that the matter is so as the party has
alleged; and therefore the Barons gave Order, That the Process against the
Tenants of the Lord Dacres should be stayed.

CCCXXXVI. George Ap-Rice's Case. Trin. 32 Eliz. In the Exchequer.
IN the Case of one George Ap-Rice, The matter was, Ante 121.
That Tenant in tail after possibility of issue extinct, assigned over his
Estate unto A. against whom he in the Reversion brought a Quid juris clamat;
and Judgment was given, that he should attorn; and upon his refusal, he was
committed to Prison, and diverse Fines set upon him, and estreated in the
Exchequer; It was moved, That these Fines were imposed upon the party against
Law. And the Opinion of the Court was, That when Judgment is given in a Quid
juris clamat for the Plaintiff, Distress infinite shall be against the
Defendant to bring him in to attorn; and when he comes in, if he refuse, he
shall be imprisoned, until he attorn. It was also holden by the Court, That the
Fines were not lawfully assessed and imposed upon him; And it was said, That it
had been adjudged in a Court of Wales, That the Assignee of Tenant in tail
after possibility of issue, should attorn; upon which Judgment, a Writ of Error
was brought in the Kings Bench; and there, upon good advise, the said Judgment
was affirmed. For although it be true, That Tenant in tail after possibility
shall not be compelled to attorn; yet that is a privilege which is annexed to
his person, and not to the Estate; and, by the assignment of the Estate, the
privilege is destroyed.

CCCXXXVII. Harris and Wing's Case. Mich. 32 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
More Rep. 4. 5.
IN the Case between Harris and Wing, The first point was, That the Lease made
by Queen Mary was void. 1. Because a former Lease of Record was not recited in
the Letters Patents of it: The reason wherefore such recital ought to be, is
not, as has been alleged by Cook, Quia circa solium Regis subsistunt justitia
and veritas; and then when there is a former Lease in Esse, the King makes a
Lease in possession, the same cannot stand together, so as there is not
Justitia and Veritas; but the very reason thereof is so high, that he cannot
take, etc. but by matter of Record; and if that he mistaken, it makes all void:
and therefore, In Petitions of Right, Ante 5, 6.
and Monstrans de Droit; If the King be not informed of all the Titles, all is
void. And therefore in the Case between Sir Moyle Finch and Throgmorton, which
now depends in the Exchequer; which was this, The Queen made a Lease for years
rendering Rent, with a Proviso, That if the Rent be behind, That the Estate
shall cease: the Rent is behind, the King granted the same over to Sir Tho. H.
It was first moved, If the same Lease should cease without Office. And it was
holden by Popham, and many other grave and learned Men, upon a Conference, That
the said Lease should cease without Office; for the Contract which is upon
Record is determined and ceased, by which the Estate which was created by the
said Contract shall also cease without Office. But yet the Lessee continued in
possession notwithstanding that, and took the Profits; but thereof after office
found, he rendered recompense to the Queen: And it was holden there, upon the
said Conference, That the Queen in her Grant to Sir T.H. of the said Estate
which was now ceased, ought to recite that Lease; For the Tenant is in
possession, and could not be punished for his occupation before Office. So in
the Case of the Vicarage of Yatton, 17 Eliz. Dyer 339. The presentment being
devolved to the Queen by Lapse, the Ordinary collated A. and afterward the
Queen presented B. who brought a Quare impedit; depending which, A. proved
another Presentment of the Queen, without mention or recital of the first
Presentment, and the same was holden void; For, in that, the first Presentment
is not recited, nor the pleasure of the Queen to revoke it; and therefore it
was in disceit of the Queen. So the Case 18 Eliz. Dyer 352. An Abbot leased for
60 years; the Lessee made a Lease for 80 years, the Reversion came to the King;
the 60 years expired, the second Less surrendered to the King ea intention,
that the King would re-grant the same to him for 20 years remaining. The King
reciting the Indenture and Surrender, ex certa scientia granted for 20 years:
It was holden by the Court, That the Grant was void, because the King was
misenformed, etc. It has been Objected, That here needs no recital; for that
the Lease to be recited is ended, eo instante that the new Lease begins. Sed
distinguenda sunt tempora; aliud est facere, aliud perficere; the first Lease
is ended, when the new is perfected, and the Great Seal put to it. The second
reason wherefore the Lease shall be void, is, because otherwise the Grant of
the Queen shall enure to two Intents. 1. To make a Lease. 2. To accept a
Surrender; and how can the Queen accept a Surrender of an Estate, of which she
has not notice? for She is not informed of it by any Record, without which She
cannot take notice of any thing. See 7 E. 4. 30, 31. Baggotts Assise, The King
granted an Office to an Alien, the same shall not enure to make him a Denizen,
for then it shall enure to two intents, etc. The words of the Grant of Queen
Mary, are, Omnia tenementa nostra; and, If by that a Reversion shall pass, was
the Question: Certainly, In verbis ambiguis Intentio sumenda est; Then here in
our Case, by this Patent, is other Land which should pass, and the Reversion is
nostra; but in property, not possession: Wherefore here (Nostra) shall be
restrained to that which is in possession. Where there are general words in
Grant of the King, they ought to be served; but if they can be served, they
shall be taken in a common and general sense; but the words shall not be
stretched. But if they cannot be served, then they shall not be void, but the
King shall be rather prejudiced; and always the Grant of the King either may be
served or taken to a common intent, 2 H. 3. 4. Quaelibet Concessio Domini Regis
capi debet stricte contra Dominum Regem, quando potest intelligi duabus viis:
As if two be jointly endebted to the King, and the King pardons to one of them
Omnia debita, the same shall not extend to joynt-Debts, but to those Debts of
which he is only Debtor, 40 E. 3. The King granted to a Subject the Fines and
Amercements hominum suorum; All which hold of him by Homage, may be said
homines suos; and also his Villeins are, homines suos; but because the general
words may be served, the said Grant shall be taken to extend to his Villeins
only. So in our Case the general words may be served with Lands in possession,
and shall not extend to Lands in Reversion. At another day the Case was argued
by Popham Attorney General, and he conceived, That by the Lease made 2 Mar. both
the former Leases, as well that which was made by Henry the eighth, as that
which was made in Reversion by the Bishop of Bath and Wells, are gone. Lessee
form term of years to begin at a day to come, accepts a new Lease in
possession, which is to continue until the future Interest shall commence, the
future Interest is gone; and in Barkings Case, 2 Eliz. It was holden by Dyer
and Brown, that where Lessee for two years accepts a new Lease to begin two
years after, this new Interest of a term determines the present Interest. For
as the Lessor cannot contract with a Stranger for the Interest of a Term, which
is to have continuance during a former Term; by the same reason, when the first
Termor will accept an Interest of a Term from his Lessor to begin at any time
during his former Estate, this new Interest determines the first. So, if one
has an Interest of a Term to begin at a day to come, and he before the
beginning of that Interest accepts a Lease for life, his first Interest is
gone. The words of the Patent are, All her Interest, Lands and Tenements, in
the Parish of St. Cutbert in Wells, and parcel of the possession of the late
Priory of R. and if these general words will carry Lands in Reversion, where
other Lands in possession pass, etc. was the Question. General words shall have
a special understanding, if the special Construction may agree with the proper
signification and sense of the general words, as the Case, 2 H. 3 4. before
cited; and yet in the Case of a common person, all manner of Debts were
released thereby, for that it shall be taken strongest against the party: Also
he conceived, That the Lands in Reversion should pass as well as the Lands in
possession. And he said, All former Leases of Record needed not to be recited.
etc. but such Leases only which are made by the King; For Subjects may have
Leases of Record, as by Fine, Deed enrolled, etc. but such Leases need not to
be recited; For such Leases may determine without matter of Record, as
Surrender, Re-entry, etc. and then to compel the King or the party to search
for such Leases which might be so determined by any Act in pais, should be as
absurd, as to compel him to search by what means, and for what matter in pais
such Leases are determined. And he conceived, That this Lease needed not to be
recited (which was made by King Henry the 8th) For after the said Lease made,
the King granted the Reversion to the Bishop of Bath and Wells, and his
Successors, and during the time that the said Land was to the Bishop; It might
be, that the Lease was determined by matter in suit in pais, by Surrender,
Forfeiture, etc. and then, notwithstanding that the King obtained the Reversion
after, and will make a new Lease; if he should be driven to recite the former
Lease, whereas perhaps it is determined by an Act in pais, it should be very
inconvenient. Also here, if any recital should be in the Case, how might the
party interested know such former Leases, but by search? and how long ought the
party search? for his search ought to have an end, Non excrescere in infinitum
tempus. And in our Case, the most equal time for search is the beginning of the
last Title of the King, and no further; that is, from the present time till the
time of the Title of the King begins; and in this Case the Title of the King
does begin from his repurchase from the Bishop; and if the Law be such, then
here nothing is to be recited; for no Lease is mean between the re-purchase and
the new Lease: For no Lease made before the re-purchase, need to be recited.
For admit, That King Henry the 3d had made a Lease of a Manor for 500 years,
and afterward granted the Reversion to an Abbot, and afterward the Manor by
suppression came again to the King; and he will Grant a new Lease of the same,
such Lease shall be good without any recital of the Lease made by King Henry
the 3d for such Lease might have been determined in the hands of the Abbot by
Surrender, or other matter in fact. So King Edw. the 2d made a Gift in Tail,
and afterward granted the Reversion to another, the Grantee disseised the
Tenant in Tail: One who was Heir to the Grantee, was attainted of Treason, the
Grantee died, by which the Land came again to the King, who made a new Patent
of the same, without recital of the Gift in Tail, and the Patent holden good
for the Cause aforesaid. And in some Cases there needs no recital of Leases. As
if the King makes a Lease for years, rendering Rent to his Receivor, and for
default of payment, that his Estate shall cease. Now if at the day the Lessee
tendreth the Rent, and the Receivor will not accept of it; and afterward it is
found by Office, that the Rent was not paid, by which the Lease should be void
(yet he may traverse the Office;) and afterward the King Grants this Rent to a
Stranger, there he needs not to recite the Lease; for it appears by the
Office, That the same is void, and yet in truth the Lease was in Esse, etc. and
so a Lease of Record in Esse in some Case needs not to be recited. So if the
King Lease for years to J.S. and he assigns his Interest over, and afterward
Surrenders the same to the King; Now if the King will make a new Grant of it,
he need not recite that Lease; for the Surrender of it appears of Record, and
the Assignment of it is but matter in fait, which cannot be known by any
search. So on the other side, void Leases which are not in Esse, shall be cited
until it appear, as in the Case of Throgmorton cited before by Egerton; And in
such Case where the Queen granted the same to Sir T.H. the Grant ought to be in
possession, and not in Reversion, because then void, for the King had not a
Reversion. Also this Lease ought not to be recited, for the second Patent is
granted to the first Lessee; and so by acceptance of this new Lease, the first
Lease is determined. And now we are to see, if the things in the former Grant
are necessary to be recited, the Estate in the Land and the Tenant, not
necessary; The Reservation, Condition, Covenant, and the Date. The reason
wherefore the Estate ought to be recited, is to this purpose, that the King
might know, and be informed how far the Land is encumbred with other Estates,
etc. but that reason is of no effect in our Case, when the second Patent is
made to the first Lessee; for by the acceptance of the new Estate, the first
Interest is gone, wherefore of that there needs no recital. The second reason,
wherefore such former Lease ought to be recited, is to the intent, That the new
Patentee may not have color or countenance by reason of his Patent to do wrong
to the first Patentee who has the present possession by disturbing of him by
Entry, or Suit; for all the truth of the matter appears in his own Letters
Patents, and the true Estate of the Tenant in possession: But that reason has
not any force in our Case; for the second Estate is made to him, who has the
former Estate. The reason wherefore the present Tenant ought to be mentioned in
the second Letters Patents, is, so as the Queen may be ascertained what manner
of person he is, who is the present possessor; for it may be, he is such to
whom the Queen has given such Estate upon special favor for his good Service,
and in recompense thereof; and that she will not disgrace the party so much, as
to give his Farm to another over his head, which might be much to the
discomfort and prejudice of him in possession: which the Queen peradventure
would not do, if she had full intelligence of it; but rather advantage him with
it, and not let it to any other person. But in our Case here, there is not any
such matter of mischief; But it is good to consider what Tenant ought to be
specified in the Recital: Assuredly, the most sure way is, the Patentee himself
to whom the Lease was originally made; although he be dead, or has assigned
his Interest over. For it may be dangerous to rely upon the Tenant, who has
the possession; for it may be, that another has the Interest, although he has
the possession, and then the recital is false; wherefore it is best to say by
way of recital, Cum dimisimus, etc. And as to the Land, the same also ought to
be recited by the same name in such form, and by the same words as it was
granted before in the former Grant; and yet if the name was mis-recited in the
former Grant, it ought not to be so in the second. As if the King Grant the
Manor of Little-Court by the name of the Manor of Litt-cote, or the Manor of
Wellington, by the name of the Manor of Welton, the same is good by the
Statute. But if a new Grant is to be made of the same, in which the first Grant
is to be recited; now the former mis-recital shall not be put in ure, but the
very name; but in this special manner, that is, where the King has demised the
Manor of Little-cote, by the name of the Manor of Litt-cote, etc. So where a
Manor is known by two names, and the Queen leaseth the same by one of the said
Names, and afterward Grants the same by the other name; The Recital ought to
be, That whereas the Queen has demised the Manor of D. by the name of the
Manor of S. etc. And as to the recital of the Estate, the Habendum in the
first Patent ought to be recited, and all that which preceeds the Reddendum;
for, in that, the Estate is fully contained. But here, in our Case, such
recitals are not necessary; for it is impertinent to make recital of the same,
which is determined eo instante, that the new Patent is made, and that by
reason of a matter precedent, although that all be done eodem instanti; and as
to an Instant, the same is not to be considered in Law, as it is in Logic, as
a point of time, and no parcel of time. But in our Law, things which are to be
done in an instant, have in consideration of law a priority of time in them: As
Lessee for life makes a Lease for years, they both Surrender to him in the
Reversion; the same Surrender which is made in an instant, shall in Law be
understood to have degrees. The Surrender of Lessee for years to the Tenant for
life, and then the Surrender of Tenant for life; So in our Case, the
determination of the first Lease shall be first, 1 E. 3. 6. The Tenant took the
Seignioresse to Wife, had Issue, the Wife died; the Husband shall not be Tenant
by the Courtesy; for, although the Seigniory was in him at the time of the
Marriage, yet by priority in Law it ceased, so as no seisin of the Seigniory
was during the Coverture. So in our Case, eo instante that this new Patent is
made, the first Estate is determined; yet in construction of Law, the Surrender
shall be said precedent, and then the said Estate needs not to be recited. For
if there had been an express Surrender in fact, there had not been any doubt,
that recital was not necessary; Ergo, neither in the Case of a Surrender in
Law. As to that which has been Objected, That the Grant of the Queen cannot
enure to two Intents; scil. to make a Surrender, and also to make a new Lease,
The same Rule is true, where both Intents enure, and work against the King; But
whereas the one Intent serves and works for the benefit of the King, it is
otherwise: As in our Case, This Surrender is for the benefit of the King;
therefore it shall be taken, etc. as 6 H. 8. The King Grants Land to another,
durante beneplacito, and afterward the same Patentee purchases a new Estate
from the King; here needs not any recital of the former, for the second Estate
is made to the first Patentee, and the first Estate is determined by the
acceptance of the second, 3 Eliz. The Case of the Earl of Arrundel was this,
The Lord John Gray being Lessee for years of a House called Hull-rake, of the
Lease of the Queen, afterward took a Grant from the Queen of the Custody of
the same Message, with a Fee for it, and that was without recital of the
former Lease, and the Grant holden good, and yet it did enure to two Intents;
to a Surrender of the Lease, and a Grant of the Custody, but both the Intents
were not against the Queen, for the Surrender was for Her benefit. As to the
Lease made 13 Eliz. it is utterly void, for mis-reciting of the date of the
former Lease made 2 Mar. for the very date of the said Lease was the 11th of
May, and in the Recital it is the 21 of May. For although the date is not
necessary to be recited, yet here, as this Case is, the same ought to be truly
recited. For the Surrender of the said Estate which passes by it, is the
Consideration of the new Grant; then, if the same be false, the Patent is void,
for it was made by reason of that: for there is a more ample Lease recited,
than in truth it is by ten days. And so the Consideration, scil. the Surrender,
not so beneficial as the Queen expected; also this new Patent does contain in
it self a Grant of such Lands as were demised formerly by Letters Patents,
dated 21 of May, scil. Omnia praemissa, in forma praedict. dimissa, and nothing
was demised in forma praedict. scil. by Patent bearing such date; Ergo, nothing
passed by the later Patent. For the Patent of 13 Eliz. is in consideration of a
Surrender of a Lease made and bearing date 21 of May, whereas no such Lease
was, and then no Surrender, and then no Consideration. Also here the
Consideration is false; for the Lessee who is supposed to have surrendered his
Lease, before the same Surrender assigned parcel of his Term to one Hagget, and
afterward purchased a new Lease in consideration of the Surrender of the
former, and of his full Interest in it, whereas he had not the whole Interest;
and so this false consideration destroys the whole Grant. For in all Cases,
where the considerations are real, and savor of the Land, or extend to such a
real thing; if it be false, it destroys the Patent: But where the consideration
is personal; as in consideration of Money paid, or for Service done, although it
be false; yet the Patent may be good. So here, forasmuch as the consideration
is real, in respect of this Surrender, and is false as appears before, the
Patent is void: And as to this point, there is not any difference between
Consideration and Suggestion; for if it be real and false, the Patent is void;
contrary, where personal. But in some Cases where the Letters Patents are, Ex
certa scientia, etc. such falsity in the reality shall not hurt. Which see 18
Eliz. Dyer 352. So the Case between Manxel and Turvil, where Lessee for years,
his Lease being expired, supposing that he had twenty years of his Lease not
entered; in consideration of such Interest, took a Patent de novo, the same was
void. So Owens Case: Terril being Lessee for years of the Parsonage of P. in
the County of Sommerset, of the Grant of the King for certain years; In
consideration of his said Interest, obtained a Grant of the Queen of Lands in
Wales, whereas in truth he had before assigned his Interest in the said
Parsonage to another; and it was adjudged, That the said Grant of Lands in
Wales was void, for the Consideration was void; and so the Consideration being
real, was false. And in some Cases, a Consideration personal, if it be false,
shall destroy the Patent, if it be future and executory; as if the King Grants
Lands to J.S. ea intention, that he shall pay to J.D. 10 l. Now if he do not
pay it, the Patent is void, and the Estate given by it void also. It has been
Objected by Godfrey, That by this Surrender, the Patent was cancelled, and so
the parcel of the Term which was assigned to Hagget, was defeated and avoided,
forasmuch as the Original Letters Patents out of which the Estate of Hagget was
derived, are cancelled, and so there is a good Surrender, and then the
Consideration is true; especially, forasmuch as Hagget being Assignee but of
parcel of the Term, cannot have a Constat by the Statute of 4 E. 6. As to that
I conceive, That the Assignee of part of the Interest may have a Constat by
that Statute, notwithstanding the Surrender of the Letters Patents, and the
cancelling of them; and for that matter the difference is, If the Roll remains
a Constat may be, although that the Patent be cancelled. See Brook, Patents 89.
32 H. 8. If a Vacat be entered upon the Roll, then no Constat can be afterward;
and therefore in Sydnies Case, the Assignee could not have a Constat, because
there was a Vacat entered upon the Roll. But a Constat had before any Vacat
entered upon the Roll; such a Constat is good, notwithstanding the Vacat
afterward: And it does not appear, that any Vacat is entered upon the Roll; so
for any thing that appears, Hagget may have a Constat, and then his Interest is
saved to him, and then the Surrender is void, and the Consideration false; and
although there be other Considerations in the Letters Patents, which are true
and good, yet that shall not help the matter. For if any part of the
Consideration be false, the Patent is void in all; and so it was holden in
Manxell's Case, cited before, and so be prayed Judgment for the Plaintiff.
Egerton Solicitor, to the contrary. Where the words ex certa scientia, are not
put in Letters Patents; they shall be intended to be made at the suggestion of
the Patentee, and so the Grant shall be taken beneficially for the King, and
strictly against the Patentee: But where such words are put in the Letters
Patents, there the Grant shall be taken beneficially for the Subject; These
words, Ex speciali gratia, imply the bounty of the King, certa scientia
excludes all ignorance, and mero motu show the voluntary and liberal
benevolence of the King, without suit of the party; and where the words in such
Letters Patents are general, they shall be construed liberally for the Subject,
but with limits and bounds, that nothing pass in such case, but such things
which are aptly signified by such special words; as to pass two things, where
the meaning of the King was to pass but one. And if the Patent be conceived
utroque modo tam ex certa scientia, etc. as upon the suggestion of the party;
If the Suggestion be in any part false, the whole Patent is void, for the
Suggestion extenuates the force of the other words, Juris forensis est, si quid
falsis precibus obtentum acquirenti non proderit; and to that purpose he cited
the Case, 18 Eliz. Dyer 352. before cited. And he conceived. That the Lease
made by Queen Mary is utterly void. 1. Because the first Lease of Record is not
recited. 2. If the same shall be good, the Queen should accept a Surrender,
where she knew not of it; and so the Patent should enure to diverse Intents. 3.
This Lease is made by general words; that is, Of all the Lands in the Parish of
St. Cuthberts: For these general words may be well satisfied with the Lands
which the King has in possession; and therefore they shall not extend to the
Lands which are now in Question, of which the Queen at the time of the Grant
had but a Reversion; and first I conceive, That general words without any
restraint or limitation, will pass nothing: As, if the King pardons all
Demands, or Grants Omnia terras and tenementa sua; But, general words qualified
with a restraint, where the Limitations are effectual; As, if the King Grants
Omnia terras and tenementa sua in D. which he has by the Attainder of J.S. or
which were the possessions of such dissolved Monasteries, such Grants are good;
And where the Case is, That Queen Mary has the Lands in possession, of the
annual value of 19 l. and other Land there in Reversion of the annual value of
6 l. and then she Grants Omnia terras and tenementa nostra, rendering 19 l. per
annum. I conceive, That upon these words the Land in possession only passes,
because that the said general words may be aptly served and satisfied with the
Lands in possession, if no other Lands pass. And I agree, That this word
(Nostra) extends as well to the Lands in Reversion, as to Lands in possession;
but most properly to Lands in possession: for Land in Reversion cannot dici
simpliciter Nostra, but quodam modo tanquam terra revertens, and not to take
the natural profits of it; for the Termor has such properly, that he shall
have an Action of Trespass, Quare clausum fregit: But the intent and meaning of
the Queen is to be regarded, and that is the surest way to have right
intelligence of the Grants of the King; For here the Queen has reserved but 19
l. Rent, which is the proper and ancient Rent of the Lands in possession; and
if Lands in Reversion should also pass, the Rent of which was 6 l. per annum,
then upon the whole Grant but 19 l. being reserved, the Queen should lose 6 l.
per annum of her ancient Rent; which should be contrary to the intent and
meaning of the Queen; and the intent of the Grantor, even in the Case of a
Subject, shall direct the construction of Grants. As 9 H. 6. Br. Grants 5 by
Babington. A Man grants Common in his whole Lands, he shall not have Common in
his Orchards, Gardens, or Meadows, for such was the meaning of the Grantor, a
fortiori in the Case of the King. It has been argued, That the former Lease
ought not to be recited, because that after the first Lease made by King Henry
the 8th, the Inheritance has been in a Subject, that is, the Bishop of Bath
and Wells; but the same is not so: For if the King makes a Lease for years, and
afterward Grants the Reversion upon Condition, which after is broken, and so
found by Office, by which the Reversion is reduced to the King; If now the King
will make a new Lease, he ought to recite the former Estate, notwithstanding
the mean grant of the Reversion, or else such second Lease is void. Another
matter has been Objected, wherefore the former Lease ought not to be recited;
and that is, because it is determined by surrender in Law, before that the new
Lease takes effect; Sir, the same is not so, for the former Lease is in being,
as the Case betwixt Fulmerston and Steward, 1 Mar. Plow. Com. 106. upon the
Statute of Monasteries, 31 H. 8. See the words of the Statute, whereof and
wherein any Estate or Interest for years at the time of the making of any such
Lease had his being or continuance. And an Abbot made such a Lease to one, who
had a term for years of a former Grant; although here be a Surrender, yet this
Case is within the said Statute, and the said former Lease shall be said to
have his being at the time of the making of the later Lease; and the Surrender
shall not be said so to preceed the making of the Lease, but that the former
Lease shall be said in Esse at the time of the making of the later Lease. And
in our Case, it shall not be taken for any Surrender, for then the Queen shall
lose 6 l. of her ancient Rent and Revenue; and always when the Title of the
King and of the Subject concur, the Title of the King shall be preferred; as 43
E. 3. The King Lord, Mesne, and Tenant; The Tenant pays his Rent at the day to
the Mesne before Noon, and then the same day before Night the Mesne dies, his
Heir within age, the King shall be paid the Rent again; for here the Title of
the King and the Subject concur together at one time, and in that the King
shall be preferred; and so he prayed Judgment for the Defendant. And afterward
at another day the Justices declared their Opinions, and by Wray, Chief
Justice, We all agree, That the first Lease ought to be recited; and the reason
which has been urged against that point, has reduced us to be of that
Opinion, scil. That the second Lease was made to the first Patentee, and the
King does not make the recital; but the party ought to inform the King of all
former Estates of the said Lands; and that he might well do, for he is well
knowing of them; and although that the Reversion after the first Lease made
has been conveyed to a Subject, the same is not material here, forasmuch as
the second Estate is made to him who had the first Estate, and might know
whether the first Estate were determined or not; Also by the re-purchase, the
King is in Statu quo prius. Gaudy Justice, although that the former Term be
drowned by the taking of the second Lease; yet it was in being at the time of
the taking of it, as it is holden by Bromley, in the Case of Fulmerston and
Steward. It is determined by the second Lease, and yet it was in being at the
time of the making of it. Fenner Justice, to the same intent. Clench Justice,
If the Grant of the Queen shall enure to two intents, then the Queen should
lose 6 l. per annum of her ancient Revenue. It was agreed by all the Justices,
That the general words in as much as they are restrained to a certainty would
pass the thing si caetera essent paria; contrary, if they had remained in the
generalty; and afterward Judgment was given: Quod querens nihil Capiat per
Billam.

CCCXXXVIII. Trin. 32 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
4 Len. 233.
A Man 30 Eliz. made a Feoffment in Fee to the use of himself for life, and
afterward to the use of his Son and his Heirs; The Father and the Feoffees
before issue for Money by Deed, granted and enfeoffed J.S. and his Heirs, who
has not notice of the first use; The Tenant for life has issue, and dies,
the issue enters. Glanvil, the use limited to the first Son is destroyed; for
without regress of the Feoffees it cannot rise, and it is gone by their Livery.
See the Case in Plowden 349. and also he vouched the Case of the Earl of Kent,
where by the Release of the surviving Feoffee, 2 Roll. 797. Plow. 347.
a Sleeping-Vse was destroyed, and could not after be revived. Harris, the use
may rise, without entries of the Feoffees; and he put a difference between an
use created before the Statute, and a use created afterward; for in the first
Case they ought to enter; and if they be disabled by any Act, as in the Case
between Gascoign and the Earl of Kent, it shall never rise; but in the later
Case, the whole authority and confidence is by the Statute taken out of the
Feoffee, and the contingent use shall rise without aid of the Feoffees, by the
operation of the Law; for there the Land is bound to the Uses, and charged with
them: As upon a Judgment in a Warrantia Chartae, the Land of the Defendant is
bounden pro loco, and tempore; and according to the Common experience in
Conveyances for payment of the Kings Debts; as in the Case between Proctor and
Dennis, The Debtor of the King makes a Feoffment in Fee unto the use of himself
and his Heirs, until he makes default of such a payment to the Queen at such a
day, and upon default to the use of the Queen and her Heirs. Cowper, There
needs no Entry of the Feoffees; and he put the difference put before by Harris,
betwixt a Use created before, and a Use created after the Statute; and now the
Feoffees have not any power to revive or to stand seized to such Uses, but are
only as Instruments to convey the Uses. For the Use is created upon the Livery,
and is transferred by the Statute, if the person to whom the Use is limited be
capable of it at the time of the limitation; but if not, the Law preserves it
until, and it cannot be by any means prevented; and he cited the Case, 30 H. 8.
Br. Feoffments to Uses 50 and there is a great difference betwixt a Use limited
before and after the Statute: For now after the Statute, the Feoffees by reason
of their seisin cannot be vouched; for they have not such a Seisin, whereof
they may make a Feoffment, and he put the Case between Cheny and Oxenbridge;
Cheny leased to Oxenbridge for 50 years, and afterward enfeoffed Oxenbridge to
the use of Cheny himself, and his Wife for their lives, with diverse remainders
over; And it was adjudged in the Court of Wards, That by the Feoffment the Term
is not extinct; and he put the Case of the Lord Pagett, adjudged in the Kings
Bench. A Feoffment was made to the use of the Feoffee for life, the Remainder
to him whom the Feoffor should name at his death in Fee, and the Feoffor and
Feoffees for good Consideration levy a Fine to a Stranger, and afterward the
Feoffor names, and dies: The party named by the Feoffor shall have the Land,
notwithstanding the Fine, etc. Beamount, the contingent use is here utterly
destroyed by the Feoffment aforesaid; and it appears by the preamble of the
Statute of 27 H. 8. of Uses, That the motives of that Act did not favor Uses;
but it was their meaning utterly to root them out: And if contingent Uses,
which are not, nor can be executed by the Statute, should stand in force; the
mischief should be, that no Purchasor should be secure of his Purchase, but
should be in danger of a new born Use not known before. And he grounded his
further Argument upon the reason of Manwood and Dyer, Where a Man makes a
Feoffment in Fee to the Use of himself and his Wife which shall be, and
afterward he and his Feoffees, and those in Remainder make a Feoffment to
diverse other new Feoffees, and to new Uses, and afterward he takes another
Wife, and dies: The said Justices were of Opinion, That by the said Feoffment,
the contingent Uses were destroyed; For when the Estates which the Feoffees
take, is taken away, which was the root and foundation of the Uses, and the
branch and fruit of the said Tree; it necessarily follows, that they also be
taken away; and also because the Feoffees by their Livery, are barred for to
enter, for to re-continue the Estate would continue these Uses, they also are
gone and extinguished. Yelverton, I conceive, that notwithstanding the
Feoffment, that the Use shall rise in his due time according to the limitation
of it, etc.

CCCXXXIX. The Serjeant's Case. Mich. 32 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
TEnant in tail, and he in the Remainder in Fee join in a Grant of a
Rentcharge in Fee, to the issue of Tenant in tail a year before the Statute of
27 Eliz. of fraudulent Conveyances; and afterward the Tenant in tail, and he
in the Remainder sell the Land; and afterward a Praecipe is brought against
Tenant in tail, who voucheth him in the Remainder, who voucheth the Common
Vouchee, and so a Recovery is had, and seisin accordingly; The issue in tail
dies without issue, Tenant in tail dies, the Uncle distraineth for the Rent.
Glanvil Sergeant argued, That this grant of the Rent is altogether the grant of
the Tenant in tail, and that nothing passed from him in the Remainder; and that
it does enure as one entire Grant, and not as several Grants: As where Tenant
for life, and he in the Reversion join in a Lease; it is one entire Lease, and
the Lease of them both; and they shall both join in an Action of Waste. But
admit that here are several Grants, yet the Estate out of which the Rent was
granted, continuing the Rent, shall continue also: And now the Recoveror comes
in the Post, and in the affirmation of the Estate of Tenant in tail; and the
Remainder is utterly defeated and destroyed by the Recovery, and the Rent
always issues out of the particular Estate, and he cited, Littl. 125. If a
Rentcharge be issuing out of Land, and the Tenant of the Land leaseth the same
for life, and afterward the Rent is granted over; now he who has the
Freehold, ought to attorn, scil. the Tenant for life, for a Rentcharge lies
always upon the possession; and if Tenant for life grants a Rentcharge, and
afterward makes a Feoffment in Fee, the Rent shall continue until the
possession be recontinued, etc. Harris Sergeant contrary, This Grant is the
Grant of them both, scil. of the Tenant as long he has issue of his Body, and
afterward it is the grant of him in the Remainder: Where a Man derives his
Interest from two, the one being a particular Tenant, the other a Recoveror, or
a Remainder in Fee; the Donee takes of each of them that which he may lawfully
give, and no more; and the particular Estate being then ended, the Donee shall
be then accounted in by him in the Reversion, etc. See 2 E. 4. 1. And he
vouched the Case of the Lord Mountjoy, The Lord Mountjoy took to Wife a Woman
Enheretrix, she had issue, and so he was entitled to be Tenant by the
Courtesy, and acknowledged a Statute, and afterward he and his Wife levied a
Fine, and died; Now the Conusee shall hold the Land discharged of the Statute;
for after the death of the Husband, the Conusee is in by the Wife only: and so
paramount the charge. Also he said, That this Grant of the Rent by the Father
to the Son, is fraudulent, and so shall be intended, if the contrary be not
showed and averred. And so it was of late adjudged in the Court of Wards, Where
a Man alieneth to his Son and Heir for Money, (and Money in truth is paid) yet
notwithstanding it shall be intended fraudulent, unless the contrary be showed
and averred.

Hanham Sergeant, This Grant shall enure first as the Grant of Tenant in tail;
and after the death of the Tenant in tail without Issue, it shall be the Grant
of him in the Remainder. And to this purpose, he put Newdegate's Case, 7 Eliz.
Dyer 234. Lessee for life, and he in the Reversion, Lease for years by
Indenture, That during the life of Lessee for life, is his Demise only, and the
Confirmation of him in the Reversion; but after the death of the Lessee for
life, it is the Lease and Demise of him in the Reversion, and he shall have an
Action of Waste ex dimissione sua propria, without showing the special matter
in the Count. And if Tenant in tail grants a Rent in Fee, and he in the
Reversion confirm the Grant, it is good. See Litt. 121. And he said, That the
Recoveror is in the Per; for it was holden in Winter's Case, That if a Man
makes a Lease for years, rendering Rent, with clause of Re-entry, and afterward
suffers a Common Recovery, That such a Recoveror is an Assignee within the
Statute of 32 H. 8. to take benefit of a Condition; and Recoveries are now
common Conveyances. And if Tenant for life be, the Remainder over in Fee, and
Tenant for life grants a Rentcharge, and afterward cease, and the Lord
recovereth in a Cessavit, he shall hold the Land charged. And as to the
Collusion, it is not showed in the pleading, That the Grant was made by
Collusion: for if the Collusion be not apparent, the Justices, without averment
of it, are not bounden to take Notice of it.

Cowper, Sergeant, Here are two several Grants, and one Grant entire in the
Letter, may enure as several Grants, as if two Tenants in Common grant a Rent
of 10 s. here are several Grants, and he shall have several Rents of 10 s. And
if A. disseiseth B. of Black-Acre, and C. disseiseth B. of White-Acre, and
afterward by one Deed releaseth to A. and C. the same shall enure as several
releases upon their several possessions. And he in his Argument relied much
upon the Collusion, and this Grant shall be taken by the Justices to be
fraudulent; for it was made 20 Eliz. and the Recovery was 21 Eliz. and in 27
Eliz. came the Statute.

Beamount Sergeant, This Grant shall enure as several Grants; i.e. as a Grant
of Tenant in tail, and afterward as of him in the Reversion: Two Ioynt-Tenants
Enfants make a Feoffment, They shall have several Writs of Dum fuit infra
aetatem, as upon several Feoffments. 19 H. 6. 43. Two Coparceners take
Husbands, who discontinue, and die; their Wives shall have several Writs of Cui
in vita: and yet the Discontinuance was joint. And 15 H. 7. 14. If 3
Coparceners be, and upon partition one of them grants to the two others Rent
of 20 s. per annum for equality of partition, that Rent shall be in the nature
of Coparceners, and so shall descend; and shall not go to the Survivour but by
descent. See 21 E. 3. 50. Also admit that it is the Confirmation of him in the
Remainder, yet after the death of the Tenant in tail without Issue, now it is
become the Grant of him in the Remainder. And to that purpose, he cited
Newdegate's Case, 7 Eliz. Dyer, before cited. But posito, that it be the sole
Grant of the Tenant in tail, yet here is not any Covin apparent; for Covin
apparent ought to be averred and proved; otherwise the Judges of our Law cannot
adjudge upon it: for they cannot judge upon probabilities, as the Judges of the
Civil Law do; for so they should many times minister Injustice in the place of
Justice: And, that the same is not Covin apparent, although it be made to his
Son, he vouched 19 H. 6. 30. and 47 E. 3. 16. Where such a Feoffment to
re-enfeoff the Heir of the Feoffor when he comes of full age, is not in it
self Covin apparent, but it ought to be expressly averred. And he cited also
Warnford's Case, 3 Eliz. Dyer 193. And also he cited 17 Eliz. Dyer 341. upon
the Statute of 27 H. 8. of Monasteries, Where there is a Proviso, Forasmuch as
some of the Chief Governors of such Religious Houses have lately fraudulently
and craftily made Leases, etc. to the great decay and diminution of their
Houses, That all such Leases, etc. made within one year before the making of
this Act, shall be void, etc. And also there is a Proviso, That such persons as
have Leases whereupon the old Rent is reserved, shall enjoy their Leases, etc.
The Case was, That an Abbot made a Lease for 60 years, 47 days before the
making of the said Act, upon which the ancient Rent was not reserved: It was
holden there, That although the Lease was within the words of the Statute,
(because made within a year) yet it shall not be intended Covinous, without an
express averment of it; for it may be it was made bona fide. See Librum.

Yelverton Sergeant, This is a joint Grant; but yet it shall charge the several
Estates when they come into possession. Also he put this Case, Cestuy que Use,
and the Feoffees after the Statute of 1 R. 3. and before 27 H. 8. join in a
grant of a Rent; It shall enure as several Grants in respect of their several
authorities; scil. one by the Statute of 1 R. 3. and the other by the
Common Law. And as to the Covin, he conceived, Tat it is Covin apparent, and
needed not to be averred: and that appears by the suffering of the Common
Recovery.

CCCXL. Brokesby and Wickham's Case. Hill. 32 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
1 Len. 167. 3 Cro. 173. Owen Rep. 85, 86.
A Quare Impedit was brought by Bartholomew Brokesby, against the Bishop of
Lincoln and Wickham, Pasch. 30 Eliz. Rot. 1815. The Case was, That Robert
Brokesby was seized of the Manor of Sholby in Fee, to which the Advowson was
appendant; and, the Church being full, granted to Humphrey Brokesby and the
Plaintiff his two Sons, the next Avoidance of the said Church; Afterward the
Church became void; Humphrey by Deed released all his right, estate, and
interest which then he had of and in the Advowson of the Church aforesaid for
the said Avoidance. Bartholomew sole presented, and the Defendants did disturb
him. The Bishop pleaded, That he claimed nothing but as Ordinary. Wickham
pleaded a Lease made of the Manor with the appurtenances, by the said
Bartholomew, to one Starkey for years, before the Grant made, ut supra, to
Humphrey and Bartholomew; which Starkey presented him: Upon which they were at
Issue, and found for the Plaintiff, That the Grant was before the Lease. It was
holden by the Court, That this Release was merely void, for here was not any
Interest to be released; but a power to present, and an Authority annexed to
the person. And afterward by the Award of the Court, the Writ was abated. See
11 Eliz. Dyer 253.

CCCXLI. Woodward and Bagg's Case. Hill. 32 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
WOodward Libelled in the Spiritual Court against Bagg and Nelson, for Tithes
of certain Lands called Christen Hill. Roll. 63. 2 Len. 29. 3 Cro. 188. Owen
Rep. 103.
The Defendant sued a Prohibition, and surmised, That one Pretiman was seized
of the said Land; and in Consideration of 5 l. by him paid to the said Parson,
It was agreed betwixt them, That the said Pretiman and his Assigns should be
discharged of Tithes of the Land, during his life, and afterward the said
Pretiman leased the same to the Defendants: upon which, a Prohibition was
granted.

And it was holden, That the party need not to make proof thereof within 6
Months, for it is not within the Statute, because a Composition with the same
Parson: But now a Consultation was granted, because the Agreement is showed,
but no Deed of it, which cannot be any discharge: But if it had been for a
time; scil. unica vice, it had been good; but for life, not. Also it is not an
express grant of the Tithes, but only a Covenant and Agreement, that he shall
be discharged; upon which he may have an Action of Covenant, but not a
Prohibition.

It was said on the other side, That although without Deed, Tithes cannot pass
in point of Interest; yet by way of discharge they might.

Cook, It was holden betwixt Pendleton and Green, That upon such words of
Covenant and Agreement, the party should hold the Land discharged of Tithes;
which was denied. For if the Grantee of a Rent Charge will grant it to the
Tenant of the Land, the same without Deed is not good. And there was very
lately a Case between Westbede and Pepper, Where it was agreed betwixt the
Parson and one of his Parish, That for 20 s. Rent by the year, the Parishioner
should be discharged of Tithes for 20 years, if he so long lived. And it was
holden, That no Prohibition should lie upon it; a fortiori, where the Estate is
for life.

Gaudy, In the Case of grant of Tithes for life, a Deed is requisite, but here
it is no^, but a Contract for Money, etc. See 21 H 6. 43.

Wray, If it had been for years, it had been good enough; but here is not any
Contract, but only a discharge for life; which cannot be during his life,
without Deed. And afterward, the Record was read; which was, That Concordatum
and aggreatum fuit between the parties pro omnibus decimis during the time,
that the one should be Parson, and the other Occupier of the said Land, That in
Consideration of 5 l. the said Pretiman and his Assigns should hold the said
Land discharged of Tithes.

Wray, The same is no Contract, but a Promise, for he does not grant any
Tithes. Afterward a Consultation was awarded.

CCCXLII. Sanderson and Ekins's Case. Mich. 32 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
IN Debt upon a Loan by Sanderson against Ekins, who waged his Law; and at the
day being ready to wage his Law, the Court examined him: And upon examination
it appeared, That the Plaintiff and Defendant were reciprocally endebted the
one to the other; And upon Conference betwixt them before the Action brought,
there was an Accord betwixt them, That the Plaintiff should give to the
Defendant such a sum, (which he had done) and that the one should go quit
against the other. And it was the clear Opinion of the whole Court, That upon
the matter the Defendant could not wage his Law; for a Debt cannot be
extinguished by word.

CCCXLIII. The Dean and Chapter of Windsors Case. Mich. 32 Eliz. In the
Exchequer.
IN this Case, It was moved, If he, who has a Rectory impropriate, 1 Len. 146.
and by the Statute of 26 H. 8. is to pay an Annual Rent for the same in the
name of a Tenth, and thereby is discharged of all First Fruits and Tenths,
shall have the Privilege of the Exchequer; for he is to pay the same sum
yearly.

And it was the Opinion of the Barons, That he should not; For so every one who
is to pay any Tenths or First Fruits, should draw other who have sued him into
the Exchequer: And so all Controversies concerning Tithes and Parsonages should
be drawn thither; which should be a great prejudice to the Spiritual Courts.

But Egerton, Solicitor, vouched a Case, viz. Coniers's Case The King gave a
Parsonage to a Priory in Frankalmoign, and the Tithes thereof being withdrawn,
The Prior impleaded him who withdrew the Tithes in the Exchequer; And it was
holden, That the Prior should have the Privilege, for the King is endangered
to lose his Patronage, or rather his Foundership, if the Rectory be evicted.

Gent, Baron, The Kings Tenant in Chief, or he who pays First Fruits, or he who
holds of the Queen in Fee-Farm, shall not have in such respect the Privilege
here.

CCCXLIV. Sledd's Case. Mich. 32 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
SLedd of Great Melton in the County of Oxon, 2 Len. 146.
was assessed to 7 s. for a Fifteenth: And upon refual to pay the same, the
Collector distrained the Beasts of Sledd, and sold them. Thereupon Sledd
brought Trespass against him the in the Kings Bench. And the Collector
exhibited a Bill against Sledd; Who showed by his Counsel, That the Statute of
29 Eliz. which enacted this Fifteenth, Provides, That the said Fifteenth shall
be levied of the moveable Goods, Chattels, and other things usual to such
Fifteenths and Tenths, to be Contributory and chargeable. And showed further,
That his Beasts distrained fuerunt tempore districtionis, upon the Glebe-Land
of a Parsonage presentative, which he had in Lease; which Glebe-Land is not
chargeable usually to Fifteenths granted by the Temporalty, nor the Cattle upon
it. It was the Opinion of the Justices, That although the Parson himself shall
pay Tenths to the King, yet the Lay-Farmor shall pay Fifteenths, and his Cattle
are distrainable for the same upon the Glebe-Lands of the Parsonage. And
therefore it was awarded, That the Distress and the Sale were lawful.

CCCXLV. Sir Walter Water's Case. Pasch. 32 Eliz. In the Exchequer.
IT was moved in this Case, 2 Len. 77. 4 Len. 44.
That if one has a Judgment in Debt, and upon the same within the year sueth
forth a Capias ad satisfaciendum, although that he does not prosecute it by the
space of 2 or 3 years; yet when he pleases he may proceed upon it, and shall
not be put to a Scire facias. And of that Opinion was Philips.

Manwood, I grant, That if one has sued forth a Writ of Execution, and the
same be continued by, Vicecomes non misit Breve for 2 or 3 years; yet the
Plaintiff may proceed upon it, and shall not be put to a Scire facias: but if
such a Writ be sued forth, and not continued, but discontinued by a year and a
day, he shall be put to a Scire facias; for it is the negligence of the
Plaintiff of not continuing it; which within the year and day he may do without
Order of the Court; but not after the year by any Order of the Court, etc.

CCCXLVI. Evans, Godfrey, and Arnold's Case. Mich. 32 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
THe Case was, Evans and Godfrey were bail for one Kemp, at the suit of Alice
Arnold. Kemp was condemned, and a Capias ad satisfaciend. awarded against the
Sureties: By which process, Godfrey was taken; and he suggested to the
Plaintiff, That Evans the other bail was sufficient to satisfy him, but that
he himself was not sufficient, but utterly unable to do it. Upon which surmise,
the Plaintiff was content, that Godfrey should go at liberty, so as he did
procure Evans to be arrested; who did it accordingly. And now Evans, being
arrested, sued an Audita Querela upon that Escape of Godfrey; and they were at
Issue upon the Escape. And afterward, It was espied, That the Venire facias
was to summon 12 in Action Transgressionis super Casum; whereas it should be,
in Audita Querela. It was said by Kemp, Secondary, That the Venire facias upon
every Original Writ in this Court (as this Audita Querela is) ought to contain
in it the Issue: But when the suit is upon a Bill, then the words are, ad
recognoscend. in Action Transgressionis super Casum. And afterward, by the
Advice of the Court, a Iuror was withdrawn by Assent, and so the matter was
stayed.

CCCXLVII. Cheney's Case. Mich. 32 Eliz. In the Exchequer.
NOte, by the Barons in this Case, If Rent-Corn be reserved upon a Lease for
years, Roll. 591.
and it is behind for 2 or 3 years, That the Lessor may have Debt for the Corn,
and shall make his Declaration of so much Corn, and the same shall be in the
Detinet; but yet he shall not have Judgment to have Corn, but so much Money as
the Corn was worth every several year being accounted.

Clark, Baron, doubted, If he should recover the price of the Corn, as Corn was
at the time of the Contract, or according to the price which it was at the time
when it was payable; or as it was at the time of the Action brought.

Manwood, The Law is clear, That the Lessee shall pay according to the price
which was at the time of the payment and delivery limited by the Lease.

Clark, A. is bound to deliver to the Obligee 10 Bushells of Wheat, and no
place is limited where the payment shall be made; the Obligor is not bounden to
seek the other party wheresoever, as in case of paymene of Money; For the
importableness of it shall excuse him. Which Manwood granted.

CCCXLVIII. Philip Fines and the Lord Dacre's Case. Mich. 32 Eliz. In the
Exchequer.
THe Case was, Tenant in tail of Lands, 4 Len. 97. Ante 241.
the Remainder in Chief, levied a Fine without the Kings License: And, If the
Tenants of the Lord Dacres should be chargeable by the Fine, (For the Case was,
that the Lord Dacres was Tenant in tail, the Remainder in tail to Philip
Fines,) was the Question? It was holden by the Barons, That the Tenants should
be discharged: But it was holden, That if the Conusor had any other Land within
England, the Fine might be levied thereof. But the Question was, If the Tenants
shall be put to plead in discharge of that which would be a great charge; or
should be discharged without plea, because it appears by Record, that he who
aliened, was but Tenant in tail in Remainder; For there was an Office of it
which was pleaded by another in another cause. It was said, Where such matter
appears of Record, as by Office, Livery, etc. there he need not to plead such
matter in discharge, because the pleading of the same is to no other purpose
but to satisfy the Court by a Record, that the matter is so as the party in
his discharge has alleged. And therefore, In this Case, the Barons gave
Order, That the Process against the Tenants of the Lord Dacres should be
discharged.

CCCXLIX. Hill. 32 Eliz. In the Court of Wards.
THe Case was, A. gave Land to B. in tail, rendering Rent; B. suffered a Common
Recovery with voucher unto the use of a stranger and his Heirs; It was the
Opinion of some, That the Rent remained. And it was resembled to Littleton's
Case, 231, 232. Lord, Mesne, and Tenant; The Lord purchases the Tenancy, now
the Mesnalty is extinct; yet he who was the Mesne shall have the surplusage of
the Rent of the Lord now Tenant of the Land as a Rent distrainable of common
right.

And it was said by Heskith, late Attorney of the Court of Wards, That it was
lately the Case of the Lord De la Ware, That in such case, notwithstanding such
Common Recovery, the Donor should have the Rent, although that his Reversion
was gone

But Cook was of Opinion, That the Rent was gone; For the Rent was incident to
the Reversion, and there is not any question but that the Reversion is gone.

CCCL. Gardener and the Hundred of Reading's Case. Mich. 32 Eliz. In the Common
Pleas.
ANdrew Gardener brought an Action upon the Statute of Winton of Hue and Cry,
against the Inhabitants of the Hundred of Reading in the County of Berks; and
declared of a Robbery committed by persons unknown on his House: It was the
clear Opinion of the whole Court, That the Action would not lie; For that this
Offense is not properly a Robbery intended by the said Statute to be pursued,
but rather a Burglary: And Robberies, committed in the Highway only, are
relieved within this Statute. And by Anderson, Every Man is bounden to guard
his House at his peril for his own safety.

CCCLI. Mich. 32 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
IN a Replevin, The Defendant made Conusans as Bailiff to Greves and Rockwood,
and said, That one A. was seized; and 6 Eliz. enfeoffed certain persons in Fee,
to the use of his last Will: By which he willed, That his Feoffees should stand
seized of the said Lands, until Greves had levied of the profits thereof 100 l.
And against this Conusans, It was Objected, That here is no Devise; For A. at
the time of the Devise had not any Feoffees. But the Exception was disallowed
by the Court. And they cited the Case, 15 Eliz. Dyer 323. Lingen's Case, A.
made a Feoffment in Fee to his use; and afterward devised, That his Feoffees
should be seized to the use of his Daughter; that the same was a good Devise of
the Land. See 29 H. 8. Br. tit. Devise 48.

CCCLII. Hambleden and Hambleden's Case. Mich. 32 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
1 Len. 166. 3 Cro. 163. 1 And. 38.
NOte, The Case of Hambleden and Hambleden, (For the principal Case, see Mich.
31 Eliz. Leon. 166. Lib. 1.) was this Term adjudged, upon the Devise, That the
Survivour shall be each others Heir. It was holden, That all the surviving
Brothers are Ioynt-Tenants, and although this word (Survivour) be in the
singular number; yet in sense, upon the whole matter it shall be taken, and
construed, as for the plural number; (Survivour shall be each others Heir) i.e
each Survivour, i.e. every Survivour; i.e. All the Survivours: and then, in
this case, The Plaintiff and the Defendant being Ioynt-Tenants, cannot maintain
an Action of Trespass one against the other.

CCCLIII. Mich. 32 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
BY the Statute of 32 H. 8. cap. 37. The Executors of a Grantee of a
Rentcharge, may distrain for the Arrearages of the said Rent in the life of
the Testator, so long as the Land charged does continue in the seisin, or
possession of the Tenant in Demesne, who ought immediately to have paid the
said Rent; or in the seisin of any other person or persons claiming the said
Lands only by and from the said Tenant by purchase, gift, or descent, in like
manner as the Testator might or ought to have done in his lifetime.

It was now moved, If A. grant a Rentcharge to B. the Rent is behind: B.
dies; A. enfeoffeth C. in Fee, who diverse years after enfeoffeth D. who diverse
years after enfeoffeth E. It was holden in this Case by Walmesley, Periam, and
Windham, Justices, That E. should be chargeable with the Arrearages to the
Executors.

Anderson, Chief Justice, held the contrary. But they all agreed, That the Lord
by Escheat, Tenant in Dower or by the Courtesy, should not be chargeable; for
they did not claim by the Party only, but also by the Law.

CCCLIV. Leverett and Townsend's Case. Trin. 32 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
IN an Action upon the Case, for disturbing him of hs Common; 3 Cro. 198. 2
Len. 184.
The Plaintiff declared, That he was seized in Fee of a Message and certain
Lands; And that he and all those whose Estate he has, have Common of Pasture
in 16 Acres of Lands called D. from the time that the Corn is reaped, until it
be sown again: And also Common of Pasture in Land called R. omni tempore anni,
as appendant to the said Message and Land; and that the Defendant had plowed
the said Lands and so disturbed him of his Common.

It was moved in stay of Judgment, That it appears here, that the Plaintiff
was seized in Fee, and so he ought to have an Assise, and not an Action upon
the Case.

But the Exception was disallowed by the Court. Vide inde, Ante 13.

CCCLV. The Chamberlain of London's Case. Mich. 33 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
THE Chamberlain of London brought an Action of Debt in the Mayors Court in
Guild Hall, 5 Co.
grounded upon an Act of Common Council. See C. 5 Part, The matter was removed
into the Kings Bench by Corpus cum causa: Fleetwood, Recorder of London, prayed
a Procedendo. It was Objected, That they of London could not make Ordinances to
bind the Subjects, as an Act of Parliament. To which, It was said by Fleetwood,
That the Custom of the City is, That the Mayor and Aldermen, and four persons
chosen out of each Ward by the Communalty, may make Ordinances, which they call
Acts of Common Council, and they shall bind every Citizen and Freeman, and all
their Customs are confirmed by Act of Parliament, and by Magna Charta, which
has been confirmed 52 times; and also by the Statute of 7 R. 2. For that King
seized their Liberties, and drove them to pay for the Redemption of them 100000
Marks, and then the said King confirmed them unto them for ever; and therefore
this Ordinance being made according to our Custom, ought not to be impeached:
As in Case of matters of the Forest, If one be punished for offending against
an Ordinance made for the governing of the Affairs of the Forest; you cannot
remove the matter before you. So is the Law called Lex Idumaea, concerning
Rivers and Fishing, in which are diverse Ordinances, That none shall kill
Salmons at certain Seasons of the year, and so of other Fishes: If one be
punished by force of such Law, he shall not be relieved here; for the Law of
the Land has always allowed such particular Customs. And see F. B. If two
Merchants put their Stocks together, and so Traffic together, and the one
dies, The Survivor shall not have the whole Stock, as the Common Law is, but
the Executor of him that dies shall have an Account against the other; and
that is per Legem mercatoriam. Cook, to the same intent. This Act of Common
Council is good, and according to the Law, that is, of Common Right. There are
diverse Statutes made for the true making of Cloth, and to take away the abuses
and deceit in the making of it, and this Act of Common Council is for the well
executing of the said Statutes; and I conceive, there is a difference in making
of Laws by a Corporation; A Corporation may make an Act for the better
executing of any Law established at the Common Law, but new Laws they cannot
make; As those of a Town, who have used to have Common in certain Lands, they
cannot make a By-Law, That such a one in such a Town shall not have Common
there; but that none shall use his Common, but at such a time; such a By-Law
made, is good. See 15 H. 7. 21 H. 7. 40. See 8 E. 2. tit. Assise 413. A Town
had Common of Turbary in a Marsh, and diverse of the Inhabitants of the Town had
made Trenches in the said Marsh; and some had not a full Foot of Land in the
Town, and such persons by their Trenches which they had made there, used to
carry Turffs out of the said Marsh by Boats, and sell them, unto the value of
20 Marks per annum, to their great private profit, and to the great grievance
of the others. For which cause, It was provided by common assent of the
Freeholders of the Lord of the said Town, That all the Trenches in the said
Marsh should be stopped, so as from thenceforth no Turffs be carried in Boats
by the Trenches. And there it was holden, That if the greater part of the
Commoners assent, the same shall bind the others who have not assented; for ubi
major pars, ibi totum: And then, if such Towns may make Laws; a fortiori, The
City of London. Secondly, This Law is good by Custom; for they have used to
make such Acts and Ordinances time out of mind, etc. and these Customs are
confirmed by Act of Parliament; and also they may appoint a penalty, for to
what purpose otherwise should they make an Act, Oderunt peccare mali formidine
poenae. Also this Action is maintainable; for an Amercement in a Court Baron,
an Action of Debt lies. Gaudy Justice, 44 E. 3. 19. 1 And. 234.
every one ought to assent. Wray, There the Ordinance made was to charge the
Inheritance but here it is only to charge their Goods; wherefore the assent of
the greater part is sufficient. And afterward, a Procedendo was granted.

CCCLV. Pendleton and Green's Case. Mich. 33 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
PEndleton sued Green in the Spiritual Court for Tithes, Ante 203. 1 Len. 94.
who pleaded, That Pendleton was not lawful Incumbent, but one Tailor; and that
plea, those of the Spiritual Court would not allow to the Parishioner to plead
to the right of the Incumbency; and thereupon he prayed a Prohibition, for
otherwise he should be twice charged for Tithes; and therefore a Prohibition
was granted.

CCCLVII. Knevytt and Cope's Case. Mich. 33 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
KNevytt brought Ejectione firmae against Cope, and declared, Quod, 4 Len. 59.
cum John Hopkins by his Indenture bearing date the 20 of May, 32 Eliz. had let
to him his House and two Yard-Lands containing 40 Acres of Land, Meadow and
Pasture, apud Tythingham de Forecomb. in parochia de S. etc. upon Not guilty
pleaded, The Venire facias was de Tythingham de Forecomb. Exception was taken
by Cook, That the Declaration had not any certainty; for it is not showed in
certain, How much there was of Meadow, how much of Land, and how much of
Pasture, there was contained in the said two Yard-Lands; and the Jury may find
the Defendant guilty as to the Land only, but not to the residue. Also, he has
not showed in the Declaration, When the Lease was made; but only says, That by
Indenture bearing date the 20 of May, etc. but does not show any day of
delivery of the Indenture, for then the Lease takes effect.

To which Exception, It was said by the Court, That the Declaration as to that
was good enough, for it shall be intended to have been delivered at the day of
the date.

Ante 193.
Another Exception was taken to the Visne, Because that the Visne ought to be of
the Parish, and not of Tythingham, etc. See 11 H. 7. 23, 24. Forcible Entry in
the Manor of B. in B. the Visne shall not be [of the Manor of B.] but [of B.]

Gaudy, Justice, You shall never have a Visne of the Parish; for diverse Towns
may be in one Parish: but here the Visne is good of Tythingham, etc. for it may
be that it is a Town.

Cook, It is but a Ville Conus, from which a Visne cannot come.

CCCLVIII. Tailor and Fisher's Case. Mich. 33 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
Tailor brought an Action of Trespass against Fisher, for entering into his
House, and taking and carrying away of his Goods. To which the Defendant
pleaded, That, before the Trespass supposed, one A. was possessed of the said
Goods; and the said Goods being in the House of the said Plaintiff, the said A.
sold them to the Defendant; by force whereof he was possessed: And, so
possessed, came to the Plaintiffs House where, etc. And by assent and license
of the Plaintiffs Wife, he entered into the said House, and carried away the
said Goods, etc. Upon which, there was a Demurrer. It was holden, That the same
is no plea; for there is no Color given to the Plaintiff; and the license
given by the Wife, is not any matter for the justifying of the Entry. And as to
the Goods, the plea was holden good: For, if A. might sell them being in the
House of another, and not in his own possession, is scrupulous to the
Lay People.

Wray, If the Goods of the Defendant were in the House of the Plaintiff with
the knowledge of the Defendant, it had perhaps been a good plea; but that is
not alleged here.

Cook, 30 E. 3. 23. In Trespass for breaking of his Pound, the Defendant said,
That he came to the place where the Cattle were impounded, and there found the
Plaintiffs Wife, to whom he offered Pledges for the Cattle impounded, to make
Amends according to reason, and prayed to have deliverance of the Cattle; and
the Plaintiffs Wife delivered them; without that, that he brake the Pound, etc.
And it was said, That this want of Color is but matter of form, which he ought
to have alleged upon his Demurrer; or otherwise he shall not have advantage of
it

Wray Justice, The Defendant in his plea does not meet with the Plaintiff;
Therefore the plea is not good in substance. It was Adjourned.

CCCLIX. Downhall and Catesby's Case. Pasch. 33 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
IN a Formedon by Downhall against Catesby, 4 Len. 113.
the parties were at Issue; And it was tried by Nisi prius. It was moved in
Banco, because that some of the Jurors did eat and drink before that they gave
their Verdict, That the Court would not receive the Postea.

The Court said, That we cannot do here; for we do not know if your Information
be false or not; and that matter ought to have been examined by the Justices of
Nisi prius, and they ought to certify us of it, and then we shall have good
cause to stay it.

And it was then said there, That if any of the Jurors eat and drink before the
Verdict at their own Costs, that the same does not make the Verdict void: but
otherwise, if it be of the Costs of the Plaintiff, or the Defendant.

CCCLX. Withrington and Delabar's Case. Mich. 33 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
IN an Appeal of Murder by Withrington against Delabar, of the death of her
Husband; The Defendant pleaded, never accoupled in lawful Matrimony: And
pleaded over, Not guilty. The Plaintiff replied, Lawfully accoupled, but did
not reply over to the Felony. It way moved, as a discontinuance of the whole.

Wray, If the Defendant pleads matter tryable at the Common Law, and over to
the Felony, there the Plaintiff ought to reply to both; but where the first
matter is not tryable by the Common Law, there the same is not needful. Quod
caeteri Justiciarii concesserunt.

CCCLXI. Lake's Case. Mich. 33 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
STephen Lake, Commissary of the Bishop of Canterbury, Fr. Alredge, Register;
and R. Hunt Apparitor, were endicted of Extortion, that they, color officiorum
suorum, had malitiose, accepted and received 11 s. 6 d. for the Absolution of
one B. who was excommunicated; where they ought to have but 2 s. 6 d.

And Exception was taken to this Indictment, because that all their Offenses
are put together, scil. color Officiorum suorum; whereas the particular
Offense of every Offender ought to be specially set down, but here they are
confounded. Which see, by the Statute of 25 E. 3. 9. That Ordinaries shall not
be impeached by such general Indictments, unless they say, and put in certain,
In what thing, and of what, and in what manner the said Ordinaries have
committed Extortion.

But that Exception was not allowed; for of that the party grieved cannot have
notice, for they took in gross, and afterward parted it betwixt them.

Another Exception was, Because it is not showed, What is their due Fee: And
that was conceived to be a good cause of Exception: And if no Fee be due, the
same ought to appear in the Indictment. And afterward the Opinion of the Court
was, That they should be discharged.

CCCLXII. Doughty and Prideaux's Case. Hill. 33 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
Action upon the Case by Doughty against Prideaux, 4 Len. 101
for these words, Thou art a Wicked and perjured Fellow, and art forsworn in
the Court of Star Chamber, as appears by an Exemplification here under the
Seal of this Court. The Defendant justified because of a Bill exhibited in the
same Court, by one Brooks, against the now Plaintiff, for conspiring with
another to endict the said Brooks of certain Felonies. And the Defendant now
Plaintiff, in his Answer to the said Bill, denied upon Oath the said
Conspiracy: And sentence was given in the said Court against the now Plaintiff,
ubi revera such a Conspiracy was. The Plaintiff Replicando, said, That the said
Brooks was Arraigned and Convicted upon the said Indictment, and prayed his
Clergy. Whereupon it appeared, because the said Brooks was not Legitimo modo
acquietatus, that the same could not be any Conspiracy in the now Plaintiff, to
procure the said Brooks to be Indicted.

Walmesley and Periam, Justices, This Replication is not good; For it may be
that Brooks was acquitted, and yet the Plaintiff did Conspire, upon which a
Writ of Conspiracy perhaps would not lie, but an Action upon the Case without
doubt: For the Replication does not prove, That the Plaintiff did not Conspire,
but that the Plaintiff was not punishable for such Conspiracy, etc.

CCCLXIII. Pasch. 33 Eliz. In the Common Pleas.
THe Case was; An Abbot leased Lands to three Men for 80 years; and in the end
of the said Lease was a Clause, That if they died within the said Term, that
then the Lessor might enter. The possessions of the Abbey came unto the King,
who granted the Reversion to J.S. who made a new Lease thereof to J.D. for 21
years to begin after the expiration, determination, or surrender of the said
former Lease.

The 3 Lessees died within the Term; If J.D. might now enter before J.S. has
entered, was the Question?

And it was the Opinion of all the Justices, That he could not; For it is in
the Election of J.S. if he will take advantage of the Condition, and defeat the
Lease; but that ought to be by Entry: and none can make such Entry but the
Lessor himself, or by his express direction, etc.

CCCLXIV. Bond and Bayle's Case. Pasch. 33 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
1 Len. 328. 1 Roll. 926.
BOnd brought a Scire facias against Bayle's Administrator of one T.B. upon a
Recovery against the Intestate in an Action of Debt. The Defendant pleaded
before the said Judgment given, The Testator acknowledged a Statute-Staple to
one B. and that the same was not paid in the lifetime of the Intestate, nor
ever after, and that they had not Goods of the Intestate in their hands above
to pay the said Statute. Upon which, it was Demurred in Law.

Crook argued, That the Bar was not good; for here no execution upon the
Statute is pleaded; and then the Judgment and the Statute being things of as
high nature, that of which Execution is first sued, shall be first satisfied:
And if this Action had been brought upon the Obligation, the Plea had not been
good: For although that Brian says, 21 E. 4. That Recognizances shall be paid
by Executors before Obligations; yet that is to be intended, when a Scire
facias is to be sued upon it: otherwise not. See 12 E. 3. Fitz. tit. Execution
73. In a Scire facias upon a Judgment in Debt given against the Testator;
Enquiry was, What Goods the Executors had at the day of the Garnishment. And he
said, It was moved, 20 Eliz. by Anderson, in this Court, In Debt upon an
Obligation against an Executor, The Defendants pleaded, That the Testator was
endebted to one A. and that they had not more than to satisfy the same; And it
was holden no plea; unless they had pleaded further, That a Scire facias was
sued forth upon the same.

But Wray said, That was not Law: And there is a difference when the Judgment
is given against the Testator himself, and where against the Executors: For
where Judgment is given against the Executors, the Judgment which was first
given, shall be first executed: But if two Judgments be given against the
Testator, he who first sueth Execution against the Executors, shall he first
satisfied, because they are things of an equal nature; and before suit, it is
in the Election of the Executor to pay which of them he pleases. See 9 E. 4.
12. As if two Men have Tallies out of the Exchequer, he who first offers his to
the Officer, shall be first satisfied; for before that, it is in the Election
of the Officer which of them he will pay. And a Judgment is a higher Record,
than a Statute; for the Statute is not a Record, but Debitum recordatum
recognitum And therefore, 19 H. 6. If the Release enrolled be lost, the
Enrollment of it is not of any effect.

And, Pasch. 20 Eliz. Our very case was moved in the Court of Common Pleas, In
a Sire facias upon a Judgment given against the Testator, the Executor pleaded,
That the Testator had acknowledged a Statute before, not satisfied, ultra
which, etc. And it was holden no Plea; For a Statute is but a private and
poquet-Record, as they then called it.

And, 32 Eliz. Between Coney and Barkham, the same Plea was pleaded, and holden
to be no plea. Also, if this Plea should be allowed, great Mischief would
follow; for then no Debts should be satisfied by Executors; For it might be,
that the Statute was made for performance of Covenants; which Covenants
peradventure shall never be broken. And afterward, Judgment was given for the
Plaintiff.

CCCLXV. Butler and Baker's Case. Mich. 33 and 34 Eliz. In the Kings Bench.
SEe the principal Case Reported in Cook, 3 Part, 25. Poph. 87. 1 And. 348. 3
Co. 25.
The Argument of Egerton, Solicitor General, in the said Case, under his own
hand, was as follows; viz. The disagreement by the Wife in pais, is good by
the Common Law. An Agreement may be by word, Ergo, a Disagreement. If Husband
and Wife Lease for years, rendering Rent, the Husband dies, the Wife accepts
of the Rent, that Acceptance shall bind her, 15 E. 4. 17. 3 H. 6. 48. 48 E. 3.
13. 16 E. 4. 8. 11 H. 7. 13. 9 H. 6. 44. 10 H. 6. 24.

Tenant in tail makes a Lease for years not warranted by the Statute, rendering
Rent, and dies, and afterward the Issue accepts the Rent, the same shall
bind him; 21 H. 7. 38. 21 H. 6. 25. 14 H. 6. 26. 19 H. 6. 43. An Enfant Leaseth
for years, rendering Rent, and at his full age accepts the Rent, 11 H. 7. 13. 21
H. 6. 24. 14 H. 8. 35. So where the Successor accepts of a Rent upon a Lease
made by the Predecessor, 37 H. 6. 4. 8 H. 5. 10. 4 E. 4. 14. The same Law in
Exchanges and Partitions, If the Wife accepts of Dower of the Land which her
Husband has taken in Exchange, she shall be barred of that Land which her
Husband gave in Exchange, 6 E. 3. 50. 15 E. 3. tit. Bar. 125. 12 H. 4. 12. etc.
And in all these Cases where there is an Agreement; and therein an Agreement
employed, scil. An Agreement to the Lease, and a Disagreement to have the
Possession, etc. And so Agreement to the Land received in Exchange, and
Disagreement to the Land given in Exchange; and all that by word and act in
pais.

And so here in these Cases, Estates are affirmed, and entered, and benefit of
the possession waived and refused. So it is also of a Right and Title of
Action, 21 H. 6. 25. The Lord entitled to have a Writ of Right upon
Disclaimer, accepts a Rent of the Tenant; Now he is barred of his Action. 13
Ass. 3. The Disseisee accepts homage of the Disseisor, it is a good bar in an
Assise. 21 Ass. 6. Pendant a Cessavit, the Tenant aliened, the Lord accepted
the Services of the Alienee, his Action is gone, 11 E. 3. tit. Dower, 63. A
Woman entitled to Dower, accepts Homage of the Ter-Tenant, the same is a Bar
of her Dower: And as it has been said of Entries and Actions, of which a Man
may refuse the benefit by word and Acceptance in pais: So is the Law also in
Cases of Estates vested, if the party does not Enter.

Husband and Wife Tenants in special tail; the Husband levyeth a Fine to his
own use, and afterward Devises the Land to his Wife for life, the Remainder
over, rendering Rent; the Husband dies: The Wife Enters and pays the Rent; now
she has waived her Remitter, 18 Eliz. Dyer, 351. 10 E. 4. 12. The Tenant
enfeoffed the Lord and a stranger, and made Livery to the stranger, although
the Freehold vested in them both, yet if the Lord disagreeth to the Feoffment
in futuro, he cannot enter and occupy the Land, and he may distrain for the
services, etc. If a Disseisin be made to the use of the Husband and Wife, and
the Husband agrees to it; the Freehold vests in the Husband and Wife; but the
Wife is not a Disseisor, and after the death of the Husband, she may disagree
unto the Estate by word. 12 E. 4. 7. And also an Agreement shall make her a
Dissessisor. See to the same intent, 7 E. 4. 7. and Litt. 129. Although that in
such and the like Cases, the Estate vests in some manner, yet it shall never
vest to the prejudice of the party without an express and actual agreement.
And, that disagreement to an Estate in such manner vested, may be in pais and
by word, seems by a Clause in the Statute of 27 H. 8. cap. 1. Where a Ioynture
is made after Marriage, there the Wife after the death of her Husband may at
her pleasure refuse her Ioynture, and have and demand, and take her Dower, her
Writ of Dower, or otherwise; scil. by word, and Acceptance in pais. And if in a
Writ of Dower, the Tenant will bar the Demandant, by Ioynture made during the
Coverture, he ought to say, Quod intrando agreeavit. See Litt. in Dower ad
Ostium Ecclesiae; If the Wife enters and agrees, the same is a good Bar in
Dower, Littl. 8.

Now in the principal Case, When the Wife agrees to the Devise of Thoby, and
the same is executed by entry; now the same is a full Disagreement to Hinton.

It was afterward Objected, That although it be clear, That the Wife may waive
her Ioynture in Hinton, by word and act in pais, without matter of Record; Yet
some conceived, That this manner of Devise of Thoby is void by the Statute of
32 and 34 H. 8. The Statute enables to Devise two parts, or so much as amounts
to two parts in value at the time of the death of the Devisor, for then the
Will takes effect; which cannot be here in this Case; for at the time of his
death the Ioynture of Hinton was in force, and so continued, until the
disagreement afterward.

Also the words of the Statute are, Having a sole Estate in Feesimple; but here
the Devisor had but a Reversion in Fee expectant upon an Estate tail, etc.

As to the first Point, it was answered, That the Disagreement does relate to
the death of the Husband, and is now, as if no Ioynture had been made ab
initio. And here the Heir shall have Hinton by descent, and he shall be Tenant
to every Praecipe; and if it be brought against him the same day that the
Husband dies, the Writ shall be good by the Disagreement after, and the Heir
shall have his age, etc. And if the Father had been a Disseisor, and had
Conveyed the Land, ut supra; now by this argeement of the Wife, the Heir shall
be accounted in by descent, and thereby the Entry of the Disseisee taken away.

And if the Heir in such case takes a Wife, and dies, by this disagreement
after, the Wife shall have Dower of Hinton; and has such a possession, quod
faciet sororem esse haeredem.

And if that the same day that the Husband dies, the Heir levyeth a Fine, or
acknowledge a Statute; or makes by Indenture enrolled a Bargain and Sale of
it; by the said agreement, Hinton shall be subject to such Acts of the Heir.
All which Cases prove, That the Devisor upon this matter at the time of his
death, had a sole Estate in Feesimple in the Manor of Hinton; and that the
third part in value descended to the Heir: and so the Devise of Thoby good.

It has been Objected, That here is not an immediate descent of which the
Statute of 34 H. 8. speaks; And here the Manor of Hinton does not descend
immediately; for there was a mean time between the Death, and the Disagreement;
and so the Will void for Thoby.

To that it was answered, That this word, [immediate] sumitur dupliciter, re,
and tempore, and shall be taken here immediate re and statu, scil. That a
Reversion, or a Remainder dependant upon a particular Estate in possession
which is mean, shall not be allowed for the third part descended; For a Descent
which takes away an Entry, ought to be immediate; for a mediate descent does
not take away an Entry, Litt. 92. as the descent of a Reversion or Remainder.

And if this word [Immediate] had not been in the Statute, Then the Statute
might have been construed, That it should be sufficient to leave the third part
to descend in Reversion or Remainder; but this word [Immediate] makes it clear.
And therefore the third part which descends, ought to descend immediate in re,
and Statu. Yet a Reversion upon a Lease for years, or for life, with the
ancient Rent reserved, is sufficient, and is a good and immediate descent of
the third part.

And this word here [immmediate] to be construed ratione temporis, is a
frivolous Construction; for the wore, Descent, implys that; For there cannot be
an expectant and future descent; For descent is clearly immediate without mean
time. But here in this case, the word, immediate, is to be taken in both
senses, et re, et tempore; For by the Relation of the Waiver, it is, as if no
Ioynture had been made, and the Heir is to have the profits of the Land from
the death of his Ancestor: And so the descent of Hinton immediate, et re, et
tempore; And, that the same time has had such reasonable Construction, is now
to see: The Statute of 18 H. 6 Cap. 1. is, That the Chancellor shall make
Patents to bear date the same day that the Warrant was made, and not before.

It has been taken, That if the Patents bear date after the Warrant entered,
they are good. Which see, 19 Eliz. Plow. Com. 492. in Ludford and Gretton's
Case.

The Statute of Acton Burnel is, That if the Extendors extend the Land too
high, statim respondeant illi qui fecerunt extent. This word of time (statim)
shall not be construed, that the Extendors shall pay presently, but that they
shall pay without delay; i.e. at the day limited in the Statute. See 2 H. 4.
17, 18.

It has been Objected, That it is a great inconvenience, that the King for his
third part should attend the pleasure of the Wife, the time of her Election;
and therefore the Will shall be void.

But the same is no inconvenience, for the Ioynture never was actually in the
Wife, to her prejudice, until she entered into the Land, etc. And now by the
Waiver, the Ioynture is avoided ab initio to all intents, as if it never had
been made: So as the King shall be answered of the entire profits after the
time of the death of the Husband; and may seize the whole Land presently,
without staying the Election of the Wife, or taking notice of her Ioynture.

And so are the words of the Diem clausit Extremum; Tibi praecipimus quod omnia
Terras and Tenementa, of which, etc. et ea salvo Custodias donec aliud tibi
praeceperimus; And that may be before any Office found: And those who have any
Interest in the Land, or otherwise may show the same upon the Traverse of the
Office, or in the Court of Wards, and have allowance of it; And so there is not
any prejudice to the King: No more, than when Tenant in Knight Service Devises
all his Lands, There Division is to be made, and the King has not any
prejudice by it.

In the true Construction of this Statute, it is very necessary to consider the
intention and meaning of both Statutes. And it is certain, That the said
Statutes were made for the benefit of the Subjects, to enable them to dispose
of their Lands for the preferment of their Wives, advancement of their
Children, and payment of their Debts, whereof they were restrained by the
Statute of 27 H. 8. of Uses.

The Savings in the said Statute are for the benefit of the King and the Lords;
So as Provision is made not only for the benefit of the Subjects, but also for
the profit of the King and other Lords.

The disability of the subjects to dispose of their Lands, to the intents
aforesaid, appears in the Preface of the Statute of 32 H. 8.

And the favor and grace of the said King toward his Subjects, to supply the
necessity of Subjects, appears by the Prefaces of both Statutes.

The later Statute, is an Explanation of the former in diverse Points.

The first Statute to persons, Having Manors, etc. Ex vi termini, includes
Tenants in tail, Ioynt-Tenants, Enfants, Idiots, Feme-Coverts; but the same is
explained by the later Act, to be of Feesimple only, and of sole Estates, and
to persons of sound memory, not of Coverture. And so, If the Kings Tenant
Devises all his Land, the same is good for two parts of it; so if he Devise
all which he has in Feesimple, and leaves the third part to descend in tail.

This Statute shall be taken strict against the Heir: For the whole Scope and
Intent of the Parliament was, to bind the Heirs, and to enable their Fathers to
dispose, so as the third part be saved to the King and the Lords. And that is
manifest, For the Estates made by Collusion are preserved, and by an express
Clause in the Statute kept in force against the Heir; but void as to the Lords.

As to certain Readers Cases, which have been put to prove, That these Statutes
ought to have a strict Construction, I conceive, Nihil operatur. A Man seized
of one Acre by Disseisin, and of two Acres by good Title, all holden in chief
by Knight Service, Devises the two Acres which he has by good Title, and
dies, so as the Acre which he has by Disseisin descends to the Heir being
within age; the King seiseth, the third Acre is divested by Eigne Title; the
Devise of the other two Acres is good against the Heir; for it is within the
express words of the Statute, Having a sole Estate in Fee-simple. And yet by
another Branch of 34 H. 8. the King for his time, shall have recompense out of
the other two Acres; and he agreed the Law to be so: but the same does not
conclude our Case.

A Man seized of two Acres in Socage, and of one Acre holden by Knight Service
in Chief of equal value, is disseised of the Acre holden in Chief, and Devises
the other two Acres in Fee, the same is a good devise; for it is within the
first branch expressly, Having a sole Estate in Feesimple, and not having any
Lands holden by Knight Service; for during the disseisin, he has not the Land
whereof he was disseised, and therefore the devise is good for the benefit of
the Devisee, and the Lord is not at any Mischief: For the Disseisee
notwithstanding the Disseisin, remains Tenant of the Lord as to the Avowry, and
the Lord shall have the Wardship of such Heir, and may enter upon the
Disseisor, and so have a third part. And that Case was put out of Gilbert's
Reading.

A Man seized in Fee of two Manors of equal value holden by Knights-service in
Capite; and a third Manor of the same value is conveyed to him by Deed of
Bargain and Sale acknowledged; and before Enrollment, he devises the two first
Manors to J.S. in Fee, and dies; and afterward the Indenture is enrolled;
yet the devise is not good for the said two Manors by any Relation of the
Bargain and Sale enrolled. That Case may well be agreed to be Law; For the
Estate does not vest in the Vendee before Enrollment, and so the Estate was not
perfectly in the Devisor at the time of the Will; For although that the
Enrollment shall relate to prevent all acts and charges made mean by the
Vendor; yet it shall not relate to vest the Estate, from the time of the
delivery of the Deed, For the Vendee cannot punish a Trespass Mean; And if the
Vendee has a Wife, and the Vendee dies before Enrollment, and afterward the
Deed is enrolled, she shall not be endowed: but here shall be some descent to
take away an Entry, yet the Heir shall have his age. But in our Case, it is
otherwise; for by the Waiver, the Ioynture was waived ab initio.

And he cited Carrs Case, 29 Eliz. in the Court of Wards, The King granted the
Manor of C. to George Owen in Fee, tenend. in Socage, and rendering 94 l. per
annum; And afterward granted 54 l. parcel of the said Rent, to the Earl of
Huntington in Fee to be holden by Knight Service in Capite; and afterward
purchased the said Rent in Fee; And afterward of the same Manor enfeoffed
William Carr, who devised the same for the payment of his Debts; And it was
holden, That the devise was good against the Heir. And the King was not
entitled to Livery or Primer Seisin: And therefore the Defendant was
dismissed. But peradventure the Queen shall have benefit of the Act. See Cook 3
Part, 30, 31. Butler and Baker's Case.

The King gives Lands unto A. in Fee, to hold by Knights-service during his
life, and afterward to hold in Socage; He may devise the whole: For at the
time when the devise took effect, he was Tenant in Socage.

Lands holden in Knight Service, are given to J.S. in tail, scil. to the Heirs
Males of his Body, the Remainder to the right Heirs of J.S. J.S. devises these
Lands, and afterward dies without Issue Male, the same is good for two parts;
yet during his life, he had not an Estate in Fee in possession.

The Father disseiseth his Son and Heir apparent of an Acre of Land holden in
Chief by Knight Service in Capite; and afterward purchases a Manor holden in
Socage, and devises the said Manor, and dies, his Heir within age, the
Devise is good for the whole, and the King shall not have Wardship of any part,
and that in respect of the Remitter, and yet it is within the words, Having
sole Estate in Fee of Lands holden; and within the Saving.

Tenant in tail of an Acre of Land holden of the King in Chief by
Knight Service, seized of two Acres in Fee, holden, ut supra, makes a Lease for
three Lives of the Acre entailed, reserving the accustomed Rent, and afterward
devises the other two Acres in Fee; and afterward dies seized of the
Reversion and Rent; The same is a good devise of all the two Acres: And here is
an immediate descent of the third part, for the same is within the words, In
Possession, Reversion or Remainder, or any Rent or Service incident to any
Reversion, or any Remainder. See the Statute of 34 H. 8.

A Man seized of three Acres of equal value holden by Knight Service in Capite,
assures one to his Wife for her Ioynture by Act executed; and devises another
to a stranger, And the third to his Wife also; The King in this case shall have
the third part of every Acre: But if the stranger waiveth the devise, the King
shall have the Acre to him devised, and the Wife shall retain the other two
Acres, and it shall not go in advantage of the Heir. So if he devises the said
three Arces severally to three several persons, to each of them one Acre, and
the one Waives the devise in one Acre, The devise of the other two is good; Or
otherwise, the King shall have the third part of every Acre, etc.

5 Co. 29.
THe Case was, An Enfant was made Executor; And Admimistration was committed to
another; viz. A. durante minori aetate, who brought an Action of Debt against
the Debtor, and recovered, and had him in Execution; and now the Executor came
of full age.

It was moved, What should be done in this Case, and how the party should be
discharged of the Execution; for the authority of the Administrator is now
determined, and he cannot acknowledge satisfaction, or make an acquittance.

Windham, Although the authority of the Administrator be determined; yet the
Record and the Judgment remain in force. But peradventure you may have an
Audita Querela. But he conceived, That an Administrator could not have such
Action; for that he is rather a Bailiff to the Enfant, than an Administrator:
(See Prince's Case, 42 Eliz. Cook 5 Part, 29.) Which Rhodes concessit.

A. was bounden unto B. in an Obligation of 100 l. upon Condition, to pay a
lesser sum: The Obligee made an Enfant his Executor, and died: Administration
was committed durante minori aetate to C. to whom A. paid the Money; It was
doubted, If that payment was rightful: or, If the Money ought to have been paid
to both?

Windham, Does it appear within the Record, That the Enfant was made Executor,
and that Administration was committed, ut supra? To which it was answered, No.

Then Windham said, You may upon this matter have an Audita Querela.

In this Case, It was said to be the Case of one Gore, 33 Eliz. in the
Exchequer, in a Scire facias, by an Assignee of a Bond against an Enfant
Executor: He pleaded, That the Administration was committed to A. and his Wife
during her minority. And it was adjudged no Plea.

NOte: It was the Opinion of all the Justices, Jones Rep. 243.
That if Lessee for 20 years, makes a Lease for 10 years, that he may grant the
Reversion without Deed: but in such case if there be a Rent reserved, there
ought to be a Deed, and also an Attornment, if the Rent will be had.

And it was agreed by them all, That if there be Lessee for years, and the
Lessor grants the Land to the Lessee and a stranger, that the Reversion shall
pass without Livery or Attornment; and that by the Acceptance of the Deed by
him who ought to Attorn: But whether he shall take jointly or in Common, or
whether in a moiety or in the whole, the Justices were of diverse Opinions. Ideo
Quaere, for it was not Resolved.
