ON THE DEATH OF MY Much Honored Friend, Colonel Richard Lovelace.
AN ELEGY.
MEthinks when Kings, Prophets, and Poets dye,
We should not bid men weep, nor ask them why,
But the great loss should by instinct impair
The Nations like a pestilentiall air,
And in a moment Men should feel the Cramp,
Of grief like persons poisoned with a damp;
All things in nature should their death deplore,
And the Sun look less lovely then before,
The fixed Stars should change their constant spaces,
And Comets cast abroad their flagrant faces,
Yet still we see Princes and Poets fall
Without their proper pomp of Funeral,
Men look about as if they nere had known
The Poets Laurel, or the Princes Crown;
LOVELACE has long been dead, and we can be
Obliged to no man for an Eligie.
Are you all turned to silence, or did he
Retain the only sap of Poetry,
That kept all branches living, must his fall
Set an eternal Period upon all:
So when a Springtide does begin to fly,
From the green shore, each neighboring Creek grows dry.
But why do I so pettishly detract,
An age that is so perfect, so exact,
In all things excellent, it is no Fame,
Or glory to deceased Lovelace Name,
For he is weak in wit who does deprave
Another worth to make his own seem brave,
And this was not his aim, nor is it mine,
I now conceive the scope of their design,
Which is with one consent to bring, and burn
Contributary Incense on his Vrne,
Where each Man's Love and Fancy shall be tried,
As when great Johnson, or brave Shakespeare died.
Wits must unite, for Ignorance we see,
Has got a great train of Artillery,
Yet neither shall, nor can it blast the Fame
And honor of deceased LOVELACE Name,
Whose own LUCASTA can support his cred^t,
Amongst all such who knowingly have read it,
But who that Praise can by desert discuss
Due to those Poems that are Posthumous,
And if the last conceptions are the best,
Those by degrees do much transcend the rest,
So full, so fluent, that they richly suite
With Orpheus Lyre, or with Anacreons Lute,
And he shall melt his wings that shall aspire
To reach a Fancy or one accent higher.
Holland and France have known his nobler parts,
And found him excellent in Arms, and Arts,
To sum up all, few Men of Fame but know
He was Tam Marti, quam Mercurio.
Samuel Holland.
