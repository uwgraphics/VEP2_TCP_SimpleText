To the Candid and Courteous Reader.
OBserving that dangerous Tenent of the Anabaptists to spread like a Gangrene,
over most parts of the land, Samuel How, the preaching Cobbler, or the cobling
preacher, is full of such tatchings, viz. that the seven liberal Sciences are
but profane, vain bablings. How Is sufficiency of the spirits teaching.
viz. That Arts, Sciences, Languages, etc. are Idols, Antichristian, the smoke
of the bottomless Pit, filth, froth, dung, needless and useless for the
right understanding of the Scripture: the spirit alone (say they) is sufficient
without these humane helps, Some ignorant people would have all men as
ignorant as themselves, that so their own ignorance might not be discovered.
Like those whom St Ierom taxes, who accounted rusticity and lack of learning,
to be sanctity. Crassam illi rusticitatem solum pro sanctitate habent. Hieron.
Epist. 84. and 102. ad Marcellum. To the understanding of the formale externum,
or letter of Scripturo, Arts and Tongues are necessary, as the assistance of
the holy Ghost is to the formale internum, or genuine sense of it. Waterhouse
Apol. page 7.
and therefore the Taylor-King of Leyden, burnt all books save the Bible. I
shall therefore take some pains to discover the vanity of this erroneous
Tenent, that I may prevent (if possible) the sad consequences of it; to this
end I shall show, 1. What we grant them, and how far we go. 2. Where we part.

1. We willingly grant that the assistance and direction of Gods holy spirit,
is absolutely necessary for the sound and saving understanding of the
Scripture. It Is it that must inlighten, enliven, sanctify, and fit us for the
work, for without him we can do nothing, John 15.5.

2. As we acknowledge that this gift comes from the spirit of God, so we
likewise acknowledge, that he bestows it now in the use of means; by Prayer,
Reading, Study, skill in Arts, Sciences, Languages, etc. True, in the
Apostolical times, God poured out an extraordinary measure of his spirit on
many, who had Learning and Languages by immediate infusion, we now by
acquisition; they had it Given, we Gotten; they by Revelation and Inspiration,
we now by Industry and Study: and yet even then we read that Paul had his Books
and Parchments, Libros vocat vetustiores ab aliis scriptos; membranas
recentiores a se conscriptas* a Lap. Apparet Apostolum jam morti vicinum non
tamen a lectione destitisse; hinc r^f^llitur fanaticorum ^uror, qui libris
contemptis damnataque omni lectione selos suos (...) joctant. Calvin Noverat
Timothy diligent-^am, and tamen illi commendat assi duam lectionem. Idem.
2 Timothy 4.13, 15. which some conceive to be Note books of his own making; and
in the person of Timothy he commands all Ministers to give attendance to
Reading, Meditation, etc. and to give up themselves wholly to them, (...), be
in them. (1) Be intent and industrious in studying, sis totus in illis 1. He
must read, and then exhort, that like a good scribe he may bring out of his
treasury, things both new and old. 2. He must meditate on these things, and so
digest them, turning them in succum and sanguinem, that so he may be able to
speak non ex ore, sed e pectore, experimentally, powerfully. God has ordained
means for the attaining of every thing, and he that contemns the means,
contemns the blessing; it is Gods blessing on the diligent hand, which as in all
other things, so in this, does make men rich; as nemo casu fit bonus, so nemo
casu fit doctus, virtus discenda est, Divina summ^ indigent diligentia^*
thesaurus no^ in superficie, sed profundo reconditur. Chrysostom.
says Seneca: We must therefore, so Read, Study, Search, etc. as if we were to
do all our selves, and yet when we have done all, so rest upon God for aid, as
if we had done nothing. Truth like Treasure, lies deep and hidden, and cannot
be found without search, and study; we must therefore serve providence in the
use of means, else we tempt God, Pro. 2.3, 4, 5. Admota manu invocand^ est
Minerva. We come now to understand Scripture by ordinary means of study,
learning, prayer, etc. not by extraordinary revelation. See Doctor Hammond in
his Preface to his Annotat. on the New Test.
If thou criest after knowledge, there is Prayer, and seek her as silver,
there is endeavor in the diligent use of means; then shall thou understand
the fear of the Lord, there is success; and therefore it was a good Prayer of
Sir Thomas Moor, Domine Deus fac me in iis conseque^dis operam collocare pro
quibus obtinendis soleo ad te orare. 3. We grant that the abuse of Philosophy,
when it is preferred before Divinity, or puffs men up with pride, or is used to
adulterate and corrupt the truth and simplicity of the Gospel, that then it is
odious and abominable. But this is not our question, whether the abuse of
Philosophy be unlawful, this is granted on all hands: But the question between
us and the Anabaptists, is, whether the right and sober use of Philosophy, See
the necessity and excellency of humane learning Dr Reynolds Preface to the
Passions.
and other humane Learning be requisite for a Divine. This we affirm, the
Anabaptists, etc. deny. I shall therefore set down this Antithesis to their
Thesis, and will confirm it by Arguments, viz. That the knowledge of Arts,
Sciences, History, Languages, etc. are very useful and needful qualifications
for a Minister of the Gospel.

CHAPTER I.
I Come now to the Arguments, for the clea^e^ convincing of our judgments, in
the truth of this point. The first is drawn from the necessity of humane
Learning: Thus,

That which is necessary for a Divine, may not be contemned, [whether the
necessity be absolute, or only of expediency.]

But humane Learning is necessary for a Divine, Ergo, It may not be contemned.

The Major no sober man will deny: The Minor I will prove by its parts. 1. The
Languages, Latin, Greek and Hebrew, are some part of humane learning, Et si
sine illa quidam non inutiles Ecclesiis fuerunt, cum tamen lingua illa totius
Christianismi quasi quoddam commune sit vinculum, and omnes pene ingenio^um
faetus in hac lingua sint editi, mutilam oportet esse cognitionen quae sine
hujus linguae notitia habetur. Walaeus
and these are necessary for a Divine 1. For Latin, many learned Commentaries
are written in that language, which a man cannot enjoy without some knowledge
of this Tongue; besides, many English words of much use in Divinity, are
borrowed of the Latin, which no man can well understand without some insight
in this Language.

2. The Greek tongue is necessary, because the New Testament was written in it;
besides, many Latin words are derived from it, which we cannot fully
understand without some knowledge here: also many terms of Art (in Grammar,
Rhetoric, Logic, Physics, Metaphysics, etc.) are borrowed from hence. What
gross errors did many of the Ancients run into, and what lame interpretations,
do they often make, for want of insight in the Original Languages; yea we had
never enjoyed the translation of the Bible, if some men had not attained this
part of humane Learning, the Bible would have been as a sealed book; for how
could men, women, and children be able to read the Scripture, had there not
been learned men, who by great pains and study obtained the knowledge of the
Originals?

3. Some insight in the Hebrew is necessary, because it is that sacred Language
in which the Old Testament was written, Habet omnis linguae sua propria
locuti^num genera, quae cum in aliam linguam transferuntur, videntur absurda.
Hyperiu^ l. 2. obs. 6. p. 117.
besides it has a certain Idiome, and peculiar form of speaking, which cannot
well be expressed in a translation, without some loss; all Authors being best
and purest in that Language, in which themselves writ. 2. The emphasis and
force of the word is more clearly seen in the Original Text, Propter
interpretum diversitat^s cognitio Hebrae^ and Graecae linguae est necessaria.
Augustine.
then in a translation. 3. There are great differences amongst Interpreters,
which cannot well be reconcil^d without some insight in the originals. Thus, in
points of controversy, when one says it is thus, and another thus, Cognitio
fonti^um necessaria est. 1. quando (...) explicare volumus. 2. ut plures sensus
inveniamus. 3. ut idi^mata, phrases, and prover^ialinguae sanctae cognoscamus.
4. ut menda corrigamus. 5. ut quaedam loca melius intelligamus. 6. ut Latini
sermonis ambiguitatem vitemus. Mel. Can. l. 2. c. 15.
we must then of necessity have recourse to the fountains. 1. Because they are
immediately sent from God to us by the Prophets and Apostles. 2. The Apostles
themselves did sometimes correct the translation of the 70 e. g. the 70 say I
have called my sons; but Man. 2.15. says, I have called my son out of Egypt.
3. He that understands the Original, sees with his own eyes, when he that
peruseth translations, sees with the eyes of others. Scit^ and sane claris.

2. The necessity of Arts and Sciences, will appear if we look into the body of
the Scripture. 1 There are physics in Genesis, Job, Ecclesiastes; how often do
we read in Scripture, of the Sun, Moon, Stars, Fire, Hail, Snow, Winds,
Thunder, Lightnings; and also of Fowls, Fishes, Beasts, Plants, Trees, Seas,
Fountains, Minerals; besides, many diseases, as the Leprosy, Palsi^, Fever,
Pestilence, etc. Without some insight in natural Philosophy, we cannon so
exactly know the nature of all these* yea we shall find Ethics in the
Proverbs, and Oeconomicks in Paul's Epistles; Politics in Sam. Kin. Geometry in

2. Grammar is requisite to explain the words, terms, and phrases of
Scripture. 3. The Scripture also is full of Rhetoric, Troporum cognitio

many Tropes and Figures are there, what abundance of Metonymies, Ironies,

gold: for the Penmen of Scripture, See more fully Perkins on Heb. 11.12. page
9^.94.
were not simply men, but men inspired with the Holy Ghost.

4. Logic is necessary for anal^sing defining* dividing, and more orderly
resolution of a Text; also for Argumentation and defense of the truth against
an adversary. The Apostle would have a Minister (...)* 2 Timothy 2.15. to divide
the word aright. Now, without some skill in Arts, he will rather tear it with
his teeth, and pull it a sunder with his nails, then rightly divide it; and
although it be the spirit of God that helps us to the sense of Scripture, in
a spiritual saving way, for we are not able by our will to believe it, to
apply it, to conform to it; yet as it is a Text consisting of words, and a
coherence to make up the sense; See more fully Perkins on Heb. 11.12. p. 93.94.
so the isntrumental way to discover that, is by the help of Arts, and
therefore* those that are unlearned, are said to (...), set them on the rack to
make them speak what they never meant.

destruction; as a (...), set them on the rack to make them speak what they

reverend Divine has well observed* neither is Logic a profane thing, (as some
profane ones imagine) for the Scripture it self uses many Logical Arguments,
from the cause, the effect, the consequent, from mercies, judgments, and from
the Old Testament, its written, etc. e. g. God is a spirit, Ergo he will be
worshipped in spirit. So, he that commits sin is the servant of sin, but ye
commit sin, Ergo. A good Shepherd lays down his life for his sheep: but I
(says Christ) am that good shepherd, Ergo, See a clear syllogism in the
second figure, John 8.47. Whosoever is of God, hears Gods word, but ye hear
not his word, Ergo, ye are not of God. This may stop the mouths o^ some that
say Christ never used Logic, nor had any humane learning.

5. Ecclesiastical History is necessary; many things in Scripture receive
light from Josephus, Historia plurimum nos adjuvat ad sanctos libros intelligen
dos. Aug. de Doct. Christ l. 2. cap. 28. Hyperius l 4. c. 2.

Bowls Pastor Evangel. l. 1. c. 19. p. 119.


Eusebius, Q. Curtius, Xenophon, besides, they will furnish a man with examples
of Gods judgments on his enemies, and his blessings on his people; being
rightly used, they will much enrich a man. They may be read at succisive hours
for recreation, after strong labor. With what cautions and conditions they are
to be read, I shall for brevity sake, refer you to two learned Authors. Now
as humane learning is necessary for the better understanding of the Scripture,
^o without it we cannot understand many classical Authors, as Lactantius,
Ierom, Austin, Ambrose, Basil, etc. who borrowed much of Cicero, Quintilian,
Virgil: And thus we see the usefulness and ornament of learning every way; to
which I shall add the testimony of a sweet Divine, ^^rough^, ^.6.3.
whose judgment may peradventure take with some men, more then another man's.
He that is learned in something, (says he) covets after more still, and
certainly none but ignorant people are enemies to learning; those that never
knew the worth of it, these are they that cry it down: therefore those that are
contented with little, nay and think their little too much sometimes, are of
poor, mean, and base spirits, far from following on to know the Lord.

Yea, Sam: How Is sufficiency of the spirits teaching. Ob. 5. and Ob. 6.
How himself confes^eth. That humane learning being sanctified is an excellent
help to the right understanding of Scripture, and that in it self it is a
good thing, and good in its proper place, which is for the repairing of that
decay which came upon man for sin, and so it is fit for Statesmen,
Physicians, Lawyers and Gentlemen, yea and all men so far as they can attain
to it, are as men beyond and above others that are without it, yea and beyond
all other excellencies that this world can afford. Well said and well sowed
Sam: these stitches will hold; yet see how like a ^ight sectary he plays fast
and loose, like the cursed Cow, that having given a good mess of milk, knocks
down all with her heels again: for mark his following words: But bring it once
to be a help to understand the mind of God in holy Scriptures, and there its
detestable ^^lth* dross and dung, good for nothing but to destroy, and cause
men to err. etc.

Quo teneam vultus mu^antem Protea nodo.

The second ARGUMENT.
That which is commanded by God, and commended to us by the example of his
servants, ought still to be practiced by us, [unles^e any one can show a
counter-mand and prohibition, which in this case none ever yet could do.]

But reading, study, meditation and humane industry is commanded by God, and
commended to us by the example of his servants, Ergo. The Major is undeniable,
the Minor I prove by its parts. 1. Humane industry and learning is commanded, 1 Timothy 4.13, 15. give attendance to reading meditation, etc. yea, he must give up
himself wholly to them, that so like a good scribe, he may be able to bring
out of his treasury, things both new and old, Mat. 13*^52. Now look what Paul
enjoynes Timothy, concerns all the Ministers of the Gospel successively to the
end of the world; but to what end is all this diligence required, if the
spirit's teaching were solely sufficient.

2. It is commended to us by the example of Gods servants, they are often
commended in Scripture for their skill and dexterity in humane learning. Thus
Moses is said to be learned [(...), Moses eruditus fuit in omni, in omni
sapientia, in omni sapientia Aegyptiorum* Pride.
he was instructed therein from a child] in all the wisdom of the Egyptians,
[amongst whom in those days learning flourished much] and was mighty in words
and deeds, Acts 7.22. Now the learning of the Egyptians is said to be
fourfold, viz. Mathematics, Physics, Ethics and Divinity; their wisdom
(what ever it was) appears to be very great, for when the Lord would set forth
the wisdom and great abilities of Solomon, he tells us that it excelled all the
wisdom of Egypt, 1 Kin. 4.3.

2. Solomon was a very great Philosopher, so that he could discourse from the
Cedar to the Shrub, Tractat Theologica, Ethica, O^^onomica, idque verbis tam
^ppositis and significantibus, sententiis tam gravibus, figuri^ adeo lepidis
and site picturatis tropis, ut ^um non solum Philosophum summum, and summum
Theologum, sed and summum orato^rem ac poetam necessario sint agnituri qui in
ejus lectione cum judicio versab^^tur. Rivet.
he had great insight in the nature and qualities of Foul, Fish, Beasts,
Herbs, Trees, insosomuch, as they came from all the parts of the earth to hear
his wisdom, 1 Kin. 4. 32, 33, 34. As he was most wise, so he was most
eloquent, an absolute Orator, one that found out acceptable words, [ Eccle.
12.10.] adorned with many Tropes and Figures, far surpassing all the
eloquence of Cicero, Demosthenes, etc. Cum divina fuerit in eo eloquentia, in
eum confluxisse par est credere, quicquid in variis olim oratoribus seorsim

3. Christ himself honored learning so far, (though he be not tied to
Schools or means) as to sit amongst the Doctors, both hearing them, and asking
them questions* and in his disputations he used Logical consequences and
reasonings from the Old Testament to the New. The Apostles also had excellent
abilities, insomuch, as the Pharisees wondered that unlearned and ignorant men
should have such gifts, but by this they knew they had been with Jesus. [ Acts
4.13.] and were trained up in his school, which is far beyond all the schools
of the Scribes and Pharisees; they were not therefore simply unlearned, but
only in the Pharisees esteem, and in respect of the ordinary means of
attaining learning.

4. Apollos is commended for his eloquence, Acts 18.24. Ingenio valebat
Dialectico, Mathematico, and Oratorio. Dr Prideaux concio. 3.

5. Daniel and his three associates, had knowledge and skill in all the
learning and wisdom of the Caldaeans, Dan. 1.4, 17. and though Daniel had a
great measure of the spirit, yet it is worth observing, that he gave himself
to study, and reading books for all this, Dan. 9.2. I Daniel understood by
books the number of years, etc. Yea so exquisite was he in all natural,
acquired, and spiritual perfections, that it was then a Proverb: Art thou
wiser then Daniel? Ezekiel. 28.3.

6. Paul was bred up at the feet of learned Gamaliel, and could speak languages
more then they all, 1 Cor. 14.18. He was so eloquent, that at Lystra he was
taken for Mercury, the God of Eloquence, Acts 14.11. he was an exlellent
Orator, as appears, Acts 26. and an excellent disputant; he disputes
Philosophically at Athens, with the Philosophers: he was well versed in the
writings of the Heathens; hence he cites Epimenides the Poet, to convince the
Cretians, Veritas ^st veritas a quocunque dicatur.
Tit. 1.12. and Aratus to convince the Athenians, Acts 17.28. and Menander to
silence the Corinthians, 1 Cor. 15.33. yea it is said of all the Prophets, that
they used means by inquiring and searching into the Gospel, 1 Pet. 1.10. By
all this it appears, that Gods dearest servants formerly, made use of humane
learning in carrying on the work of the Lord, and therefore we conclude it is
lawful and useful still.

The third ARGUMENT.
Humane learning is necessary for the convincing and confuting of a learned
adversary, how shall we be able to preserve the truth in its purity, to stop
the mouth of a subtle Jesuit, or learned Heretic, without learning? This
sanctified and rightly improved, is an excellent means to bring down
Antichrists Kingdom; and therefore it is well observed, that errors were never
higher, and truth lower, then when ignorance prevailed, and learning was
suppressed and contemned, when 'twas suspicious for a man to have Greek, and
heresy it self to have Hebrew. Popery never fell, till learning rose; it is a
dark Religion, it grows and spreads it self by ignorance and Barbarism, no
way so speedy to bring down these walls of Jericho, as the promoting of all kind
of good literature and learning.

2. If we would convince an Heathen, it is necessary that we have some knowledge
of their Authors, that we may wound them with their own quils: this made
Theodoret Triparttit. Hist. l. 6. c. 17. V plura apud Davenant in Col. 2.8. p.
183.
Julian complain, [ Propriis configimur pennis e nostris eni^ libris arma
capiunt, quibus in bello adversus no^ utun^ur.] And thereupon he made a Law,
tha^ children should not read Philosophers or Poets. Ab ^thnicis si quid been
dictum, ab iis tanquam ab injustis possessoribu^ in usum nostrum est
vindicandum. Nonne aspicimus quanto auro and argentosuffarc^natus exierit de
Aegypto Cyprianus Dr. sua^^ssimus, and Martyr beatissimus? quanto Lactantius?
Victorinus, Optatus, Hilarius^ Aug. de doct. Christ. l. 2. c. 40.
The Israelites furnished themselves with the spoils of the Egyptians; David
helps himself with Goliath's sword; Paul strikes the Heathen with their own
writings, and makes their books like handmaids to wait upon Divinity:
therefore when he came to Athens amongst Philosophers, he disputes with them*
from their own principles, Acts 17.28.

3. If we would convince a Christian of his ingratitude, unrighteous dealing,
stupidity, private-spiritednesse, etc. it may be useful sometimes to quicken
our Auditors, by setting before them what excellent things very Heathens by the
light of nature have done. Thus the Lord sends the revolting Jews to learn
better things of Heathens, Ier. 2.10. and sometimes sends us to the teaching of
nature, Been dicta Philosophorum sunt peculia Christianorum. Just. Martyr.
1 Cor. 11.14. All that has been said, may be summed up in this Argument, thus
That which is necessary for the convincing of a learned adversary, an Heathen
and a deboist Christian may in no wise be contemned.

But humane learning is necessary for the convincing of a learned adversary, an
Heathen and deboist Christian, Ergo.

A fourth ARGUMENT.
A min^ri ad majas. Quomodo quis institueretur ad prudentiam humanam* vel ad
quemcunque actum sine literis, cum instrumentum sit ad omnem vitam literatura?
Tert. de idol.
If humane learning be requisite for Lawyers, Politicians, Physicians, etc.
then ( a fortiori) it is much more requisite for a Divine, [whose calling is
more weighty, being about the soul, and therefore calls for the best
accomplishments.]

But humane learning is necessary for Lawyers, Politicians* Physicians, etc.
(according to Sam: Hows own confession) Ergo, I conclude it is much more
necessary for a Minister.

A fifth ARGUMENT.
Holy men thus accomplished are fittest for Gods use; Apud G^acos n^mosatis
inst^uctus habitus est ad docendam religionem nostram nisi ver^atus in
Philosophicis discipn^s. Arctius.
this appears in all ages. God sends a lea^ned Moses and Aaron to oppose the
learned Egyptians; he sends a learned Isaiah, Jeremy, Ezekiel, to oppose the
false Prophets: he raised up a learned Athanasius, to oppose Arrius: a learned
Austin, to oppose Pelagius: a learned Jewel, Whitaker, Fulke, Perkins, etc. to
oppose the subtle Jesuits: a lear- Camero, Moulin, Ames, Twisse, etc. to
oppose Arminius, etc. True* God can extraordinarily work by weak unlearned
instruments, and out of the mouths of babes, and sucklings, can confound his
foes; but ordinarily he fits and qualifies such as he appoints for high and
noble implovment, with accomplishments answerable to their work. God never
sends any, but he first fits and prepares them; all idle ignorant sots* he
rejects, as none of his sending. Hosea 4.6. Dyers when they would color
Scarlet or Purple, do first prepare the Cloth for it, by laying some ground
color: So those whom God intends for choice service, he first pr^pares them
and sharpens their wit by humane learning, that they may be ves^els of honor
fit for the Masters use. To make this plain by an instance; Nec dubitamus,
^aeteris paribus, maj^rem and ple^^rem mensuram communi^ari publicis ^ccl^siae
administris, ^ive in una aliqua particulari, Ecclesi^a munn^ suum ^heant; sive
in caet is aliquo leg^time, and in Christi nomine congregato, de ve^^
Scripturae sensu inter se c^^serant, quam singulis and privat^s, qui neque tot
don^s instructi sunt, neque ^ot ocul ^v^dent, ^^que privata and si^plic^
medita^^one, aequare p^ssunt muliaum collectionem and d^squis^^^onem. Rivet.
take two godly men of equal natural abilities, they both have the spirit of
God, we will suppose the one to be a private Christian, bred up to a Trade,
wanting humane learning; but the other is bred up to learning, accomplished with
Arts, Sciences, Languages, etc. give them both one Text, and equal time for
preparation; though the good man that want^ learning-may deliver honest things*
yet for want of the languages, and other endowments, he is like a Pigmy to a
Gian^, etc. The like may be said of their ^^^putations with a ^^arned
adversary* A Carpenter may as well build a house without Axes, Hammers, and
other instruments, as a man make Sermons the^ has no learning. And that all
the world may see the folly of those S^cta^ies, which want humane learning; I
shall here present you with a wes^e of Sam: How Is nonsquiturs the bare
rehearsal of them is confutation sufficient, and thus he begins his cobling
Logic. Moses forsook the treasures of Egypt. Ergo, he forsook his learning
too, which was a part of that treasure; Paul counted all but loss for Christ,
Ergo, he cast off his learning for him. The Ephesian converts burnt their
Magic books, [ Act^ 19.18, 19.] Ergo, we must burn our Logic books. Believers
shall all be taught of God, Ergo, they need no humane learning: humane learning
puffs men up, Ergo, we must throw it away: the spiritual man discernes all
things, Ergo, he has no need of humane learning: God forbids us to add any
thing to his word, Ergo, away with humane learning: humane learning is attained
by our own industry and pains, Ergo, away with humane learning, as being
fitter for Egypt and Babylon, the^^for the Church of Christ: Simon Magus must
repent of his wickedness, Ergo he must repent of his humane learning: God
respects no man's person, Ergo, unlearned men are fitter for the Ministry, then
learned: God chooses the foolish to salvation, Ergo, he chooses the foolish
for administration: since the Gospel is foolishness, Ergo, it must have
foolish Teachers. If there be any thing here that needs an answer, you shall
have it in the answers ^he Objc^
Contraries must not be put together, but the Gospel and hu^ane learning are
contraries. That which is cursed, and we must beware of being spoiled by it,
that must be abhorred, but such is Philosophy, Col ^.8. There Is a great woe
falls on the world. Rev. 9* 1. to 11. Now, part of this woe is humane learning,
the very smoke of the bottomless pit, E^go. Thus we see what it is to want
humane learning, and how this man's illogicall consequences do agree, like Harp
and Harrow, and come as near together, as St Germans lips, which were nine
miles asunder.

A sixth ARGUMENT.
That which is the badge and practice of wicked men* may not be practiced of
the people of God; [they ^ust not conform themselves to the wicked of the
world.]* But to seek the destruction of humane learni^g, is the badge and
practi^e of w^cke^ men* I never read in any History, ^acred or Divine, of any
but wicked men that ever did oppose it; Julian the Apostate was one, he sought
to destroy ^chools of learning, that with their down^all, he might the better
destro^ the Christian Faith. V. Nazianz. Orat. 3. Socrat. l. 3. c. ^.10.
Fidel^bus prohebu^t ^^tam Philosophiam liberales ar^es, lectionem E^hnico^um
scriptorum, fieri non potest quin vehementer prosit* quod Hostis prohibuit.
Aretius.

Humanitatis studia ita oderat and contemnebat, ut ejus studiosos uno nomine
Haereticos appellaret, etc. Platina in vit. Pauli 2. page 793.
2. The next that I read of, was that wicked Pope Paul the second, who so hated
humane learning, that he called al scholars Heretics, or such as should but
^ame an University in jest or earnest, persuading the Romans not to bring up
their children in learning, saying, that 'twas sufficient if they could but
write and read: Sure Sam: How, Tom: Coll^er, and this Pope, were kinsmen, they
speak all one Dialect.

3. The last are the tumultuous Anabaptists, Familists, Antinomians. and
Li^ertines in Germany, they cried down humane learning, and burnt all books
save the Bible* etc. but we know their end.

The seventh ARGUMENT.
If humane learning be needless, then the erection of Universities and Schools
of Learning would be vain; [for to what end were it to set up Schools of
Philosophy, Arts, Sciences, etc. if none might learn the^^.]

But the erection of Universities and Schools of learning, is not vain: for we
read in Scripture of Schools and Colleges, where the sons of the Prophets
were trained up in learning, and studied the Law of God, that they might be fit
to teach others. Hic erat caetu^ and collegium Prophetarum.
Thus Samuel kept a School a N^ioth in Ramah, 1 Samuel 19.19, 20. Elisha erects a
School at Gilgal, and there like a Regens, docens dirigen^, quasi dux and
Magister, ^ Lap. Hinc colligimus quasdam fuisse Prophetarum scholas, in quibus
sormarentur, qui deinde ver am religionem docerent, purilate ^que doctrinae
retinerent, Calvin.
Tutour or Master instructs those young men, called the sons of the Prophets,
2 Kings 4.38. We read of another School at Bethel, 2 Kings 2.3. and another at
Jericho, ver. 5. and another at Mount Ephra^m, 2 Kings 5.22. Paul was brought
up at the feet of a learned Gamaliel, Acts 22 3. with ^ 1.39. By him it is like
he was informed in humane learning, wherein he did excel ^s appears by his
writings: And therefore all zealous Constantines have in their several
generations, been careful to erect and encourage Schools and Nurseries of good
literature and learning, with all their might. True, the place can do little
if the spirit be wanting; [as Si desit SS. non adjuvat. locus; idem enim Let
q^i in Sodomi^ sanctus ex^^tit, in monte peccavit, primus nuster pareus, in
Paradisa concidit, and si locus servare po^uisset, Satan de c^lo non
cecidisset, Greg.
Gregory super Ez^k 9 in another ca^e ^aies] but yet the spirit works by mean^,
and it is good to ^it in the winds way, we shall ^ail the sooner and the better
for it.

Ob. There is no such express command in scripture, for any such Schools of
learning.

An. Yet there is that which is equivalent to it, for we read of the Schools of
the Prophets, and of a College, 2 Kings 22.14* Huldah the Prophetess dwel^ in
the Quo loco d^batur opera eruditio^^ and doctrinae; in eo enim habitabant
prophitae and doctores, ^ Lap. Among the ^^ralites 48 Cities were appointed ^or
the Levites, which were as the common Schools and Universities for the ^hole
Kingdom. Pu^ h^^ Pilg. lib. 1. cap. 11.
College (i) in the place where the Prophets, and such as were children of the
Prophets, had their usual abode. [as the late learned Annota^. well observe]
We read also that the sons and pupils of the Prophets, had a peculiar place
to dwell together in, which upon their increase, was too little for them, and
therefore they desire it may be enlarged, 2 Kin. 6.1.2, etc. A School to teach
children to write and read, is no where in expre^s tear^s commanded; yet Sam:
How and Collier (as ^lack as he is) acknowledge tha^ children ought to be
taught to wri^e and read. He that would see all the objections made against
Universities more fully answered, let him peru^e that lea^ned, modest,
elaborate Treatise o^ Mt ^lake, Vindiciae foederit. chap. 18. (...) Ca^v^nus
Scho^as aperir^ and doctores constitu^ nec^sse est: nam si haec ordinaria media
neglexerimus, and librorum aliarumque ^erum ad studia necessariarum curam
abjecerimus, qu^bus erudiantur and praeparentur futari ol^m divinae voluntatis
testes, and qui ecclesiam aliq^o ordine regant, horrenda^ sane confusionem in
e^clesiam, and in nostra capita derivabimus.

The eighth ARGUMENT.
If the quilders of Babylon have been, and still are at great cost and charges
to promote learning, that they may the better destroy the truth, surely then
the builders of Zion (who have far better work, and shall have better wages)
ought to be more active this way; but the builders of Babylon have been, and
still are at great cost and charges to promote learning, that they may the
better destroy the truth; [hence they have set up eighteen Universities in
Spain, eleven in Italy* many in France, and shall England have none to oppose
them?] Some have pictured the world with its feet upwards, to note unto us,
that all things in it are turned upsidedown; surely if Universities and Schools
of good learning, which our pious ancestors have been at such cost to erect,
should now be destroyed, this picture of the world would soon be ours* and a
flood-gate would be opened to all errors, heresies, blasphemies, profaneness
and barbarism it self, as we see amongst the savage Indians. Hence this
present Parliament acknowledge, that for the propagation of the Gospel in New
England, Universities* Schools and Nurseries of literature must be settled
there, for instructing and civilizing them. See the Act for promoting the
Gospel in New England.

The ninth ARGUMENT.
That which in it self considered, is an excellent gift of God, and is
ordained by him for excellent ends and uses, may in no wise be contemned by us:

But humane learning in it self considered, is an excellent gift of God, and
is ordained by him for excellent ends and uses.

Ergo, it may in no wise be contemned by us.

The Major is clear. S. How con^es^eth that humane learning in it sel^* is a
good thing, and good in its proper place, for the repair^ng of that dec^y which
came upon man for sin. N^w i^ humane learning be to good, then the more of it
the better, there can be no ^xc^^^e of what is good in it self.

P^rit philosophia ingenuitatem, qua redduntur ingenia liberalia, atque it^
p^aepara^tu^ ad mu^us vitae recte ob u^^ae Alst. Non (...) sed persi^^ not^^^as
naturales; persicit intellectu^ q* parit cognitione^ De^ and Creaturatum,
Alsted.


The Minor I prove by its parts.

1. Humane learning is an exc^llent gift of God, far surpassing all the
rich^s and treasures of the world; those adorn but the outward ^an, this helps
to enrich and enoble the soul, which is the better part; and therefore the
holy Ghost commends the godly for their excellency in this particular, as we
have seen in the second Argument.

2. God has ordained it for excellent ends and uses: It Is an excellent means
to prepare us for the true Religion, it helps to civilize us, and to mollify
the harshnesse, and mitigate the fierceness of our natures, it roots up
barbarism, bea^tlinesse, cruelty, etc. on^ of their own could say,

-- Ingenuas didicisse fideliter arts. Emollit mores, nec sinit esse feros*
Ovid. it helps to preserve humane societies in peace; its also a means to
improve and perfect our natural gifts and abilities. It fits us for noble
achievements, and excellent employments, both in Church and State.

The tenth ARGUMENT.
That which ha^n ^e^n commended to us by the unanimous consent of the A^c^ent
Fathers, and by the Church of God ever since in its ^uceeding generations,
ought not to be lightly rejected of us; but the so^er and modest use of humane
learning, has been commended to us by the Ancient Fathers, and by the Church
of God ever since in its succeeding generations, Ergo, it ought nor to be
lightly rejected of us.

The Major no ^ober ^an will deny. The ^^nor I prove. 1. See Austin de Doct
Christiana l. 2. total. (and Epist. 13^.) where he pleads for ^ra^mar,
Rhetoric, Logic, etc. 2. See Ierom Epist 84. ad Magnum, and 102. ad Marcellam
and Praef. in Job. So Clemens Al^xandr^nus, l 1 and ^. Stromat. I^a B^si^ us

Diluuntur Sophismata. CHAP. II.
I Come now to answer all the Cav^ls and Objections which Anabaptists, Antino^
ians, Familists and Libe^^ines. etc. have fiamed against humane learning. When
one had made a long O^ation in the praise of Hercules, ne asked hi^, Quis illum
vi^u^e^avit? who ever di^praised him? implying that 'twas a needless thing to
pra^se that which n^ne ever yet dispraised: but if any should ask me who ever
dispraised humane learning* I think ther^ is no part of the Land but can tell
him. Yet I wish there were not some that have been trained up to learning, that
do despise and dispraise it; if wisdom must be beaten, Oportet sapientiam ab
insipientibus feriri, Diogen.
let it be by her foes, not friends* by fools, not wise men, by Barbary and not
by Athens: what their great Bulwarks, and strong ^olds are, I come now to
examine.

1. Ob, Their Achilles and chief Argument is, Colos. 2.8. Beware lest any man
spoil you through Philosophy, and vain deceit, after the traditions of men,
after the rudiments of the world* and not after Christ; from hence they argue
thus;

Whatsoever the Scripture condemns, that must not be practiced:

But the Scripture condemns Philosophy, Ergo.

Ans. The Major must be limited thus, whatsoever the Scripture really and
absolutely condemns, that may not be practiced by us; [for there be many
things in Scripture, which are comparatively and seemingly condemned, which yet
are not absolutely condemned, nor unlawful, as See more, Appendix, Rule 32
Hos. 6.6. John 6.7, etc. I will have mercy and not sacrifice (1) comparatively
mercy rather then sacrifice.] and then the Minor is false. But all Philosophy
is really and absolutely condemned in Scripture. For the Apostle does not in
this place condemn all P^ilosophy, but only abusive Philosophy, such as
spoils and corrupts the soul with its delusions; and is Philosophia falsa and
fut^lis, Philosophia no^e est uisi (...) Camerarius.

Sub philosophiae nomine tantum damnat omnes adulterina^ doctrinas quae
nascuntur ex humano c^pi^e, qualemcunque habeant ^^tionis colorem. Calvin in
lo.


falsely so called. The words are plain, beware lest any man spoil you [or
make a prey of you, by causing you to err from the faith] through Philosophy:
So then it is not all Philosophy, but spoiling Philosophy, vain Philosophy,
such as the false Apostles used; whom he compares to Thieves, who labor
secretly and subtly to make a prey of the flock, when they cannot do it
violently. [So much the Original will bear (...). Qui depraedetur vos, verbum
militare, quod significat praedam eligere.] This will further appear.

1. From the Context. 2. By the Exegesis. 3. By the Apostles practice.
1. From the Context, ver 4. Let no man beguile you with intising words. See,
it is not simply and absolutely words, but beguiling entising words which the
Apostle condemns: (...), qui ^also ra^^^cinando* fallit.*
So it is not simply and absolutely Philosophy, but deceitful beguiling
Philosophy, which draw^ the heart away from Christ, and the simplicity of the
Gospel. Non verum usum syncer^ Philosophiae, sed abusum, qui est confu^io
Philosophiae cum Evangelio, prohibet; vel potius sop^^sticen illam rejicit,
quam falsi aliqui Philosophiae titulo venditant* cum sit tantum inanis quaedam
deceptio, P^zel. 2. By the Exegesis, the latter part of the verse (as it is
us^all in Scripture) does expound the former. Cavete a Philosophia quae nihil
aliud est quam inanis deceptio. Calvin.
Beware lest any man spoil you through Philosophy; but what Philosophy does
the Apostle mean? why he tells you, such as brings forth (...), vana ^ec^ptione.
V^r^ Philosophia est partus rectae rationis, and ae^erna veri^^^i^ (...). (1)
^vul^^ particula, C^em. Alex. Sirom. 1.
vain deceit* and is full of sophistry, and captious subtilty. Now not all
Philosophy is such; for true Philosophy is the truth of God, and the fruit of
right reason, Romans 1.18.19. it is (...) ipsius, much of God may be seen in the
nature of the Creatures, Acts. 14.17. 2. The Philosophy which Paul condemns is
such as is according to the Traditions of men, not according to the mind of
Christ, but such as is pleasing to flesh and blood 3. It is founded in the
rudiments of the world, and withdraws men from Christ; and then the best
Ethicall Philosophy in ^lato, Aristotle, etc. when it in is put the name of
Christ, must be rejected.

3. The Apostles practice shows that he does not condemn all Philosophy, for
himself often used it, in disputing Philosophically, with the Philosophers at
Athens, and confounding them out of their own writings. Acts 17.28 29. Romans 1.
and was well ver^ed in humane Authors, as appears by his prompt quotations of
them Now see what a Paralogism here is [ fallacia a dicto secundum quid, N^que
s^mplici^e^ damnatur ab Apostolo philosopia, sed (...) (1) quatenus sese intra
fines sues non continet, nec ad gloriam Dei f^rtur, nec verbo Dei regi s^
sinit. Beza.
ad dictum simplicite^] because the Apostle condemns spoiling Philosophy, vain
Philosophy, beguiling, false, frivolous Philosophy, Ergo, he condemns true
Philosophy, which is a gift of God, and a great help to the knowledge of
Divinity It Is plain, that the Apostle condemns the abuse, and not the true use
of Philosophy. Now if the abuse of a thing must take away the use of it; away
then with the Sun, which some Idolaters worshipped by day, and with the M^on,
which they worshipped by night, and so were Atheists by day and night; yea away
them with bread, drink, clothes, fire, air, water, etc. for all these are
abused by men, Fallacia Aridentis.
Ergo, by this Anabaptisticall Logic, they must be all cast away. We must
therefore know, that when the Scripture or Fathers condemn Philosophy, it is the
vanity, errors, figments, and abuse of Philosophy, which they speak against,
Si Philosophiam damnare^ Apostolus, damna^et utique lum^n rationis, and Deum
ejus authorem summa of ^^ceret injura^a. Davenant in Col. 2.8. ubi plura.
and not that knowledge of the truth found out by the light of natural reason,
whereby we come to know much of God, this being an excellent gift of his,
granted to man for his good, being no way repugnant, but subservient to
Divinity. Ad rem and apposite Tilenus, [ Syntag. P. 1. p. 59.] Quae a^versus
Philosophiam, vel P^ulus, vel prijc^ Pa^res paulo inclementius dixisse
videntur, abusum ipsi^s, non ipsam, sed (...) q^and^m and insan^entem
sapient^am, Philosophiae nomine (...) in. e dignam, perstring^n^. The (...) me
of the Apostles words is this q. d. Have a special care, lest any false
Teachers make a prey of you, and beguile you with their vain Philosophy and
worldly wisdom, mixing Divine things with humane, and measuring heavenly
m^steries by their natural reason, drawing you from the truth of Christ, and
from the simplicity of the Gospel, to the traditions of men, and beggarly
rudiments of the world.

The second OBJECTION.
Romans 1.21, 22. The Apostle condemns the Gentiles (say they) that had but mere
natural knowledge, because they did not glorify God, but became unthankful,
vain in their imaginations, foolish and dark, etc.

So 1 Cor. 1.20. The wisdom of this world (i) Philosophy (say they) is
condemned as foolishness: From hence they argue thus;

That which breeds idle speculations, vain deceits, aerie nothings, but fills
men full of foolishness and darkness, that must be avoided;

But Philosophy does so, Ergo.

An. I answer to the Minor by distinguishing of Philosophy, which is twofold.
1. Philosophia proprie sic dicta, Philosophy truly so called, which is an
excellent gift of God, and a part of divine wisdom, Res Dei ratio. Tertullian.
whereby we come to know much both in Divine and humane things, so far as by
the light of nature they may be known. This the Scripture never condemns; but
rather condemns men for not walking up to such knowledge, and answerable to
such light Romans 1.

2. There is Phil^so^hia (...), improprie and ^busive sic dict^, Philosoph
false^y ^o called, Secuti sunt non veritatem cordibus impressam and in operibus
Dei ^lucen^e^, sed vanissi^^^ suos (...), and disq^^si ^ ^es. Pareus De
mundanae sapienti^ vanitate lequitur. Calvin.
when men follow the idle dreams* vain speculations, and a^r^ nothings of
their own brain, besides, and contrary to the word of God. This, and this
alone is that which the Scripture so often condemns, it is not true Philosophy,
but va^^e Philosophy, not the right use, but the vain* and foolish abuse of it,
as appears, Ephesians. 4.14. and 5.6. 1 Cor 2 4. 1 ^im. 1 4. and 6.20. and 2. ^ 16.
Tit. 3.9 It Is that Science falsely (not truly) so called, which exalts it ^el^^
against Go^. and co^^upts the simplicity of the Gospe^l which the holy Ghost in
Scripture ^o o^t blames No ^ this is mere fallaci^us arguing ((...) former
from Col. 8) to (...) the abuse of a thing (...) ^ll the true use of it; and
would ^ve^^hrow all things qui^kly. Ad rem and apposi^e Partus. Deus
Philosophiam per se non rejicit, quae alioqui inter eximia Dei dona censetur;
sed quia absque vera illa sapientia, quae in agnitione and timore Dei consisti^
mera est vanitas omnis humana prudentia and eruditio. Pareus.

The like answer serves for 1 Cor. 1.20. The Apostle there condemns not the
use, but another abuse of Philosophy, in that they set it above Divinity, when
like a handmaid, it should only have waited on it. Qui vult sapiens fieri in
Aristotele, stul^i ficetur in Christo, ut Catechismus regat Philosophiam, non
regatur ab ca* Luther.
This appears from the circumstances in the Text, they preferred their own
wisdom, and made it the Rule of their lives, contemning the Cross of Christ,
and its doctrine as foolishness, ver. 18 22, 23. they preferred their humane
reason, and philosophical conceits before the plain preaching of Christ
Crucified, which they accounted foolishness* all that these Gentiles sought
for, was wisdom, wisdom (1) a wisdom con^ormable to natural reason,
believing no more in Religion, then they can see natural reason for. This is
that the Apostle blames them for, as Calvin well observes. Non simpliciter
damnat ^postolus aut naturalem perspicaciam, aut prudentia^ usu and experientia
collecta^, aut cultum ingeui^ literis comparatum, sed hoc totum ad
perspiciendam spiritualem sapientiam nullius esse momenti affirmat.

The third OBJECTION,
The Ancient Fathers do of^ condemn Philosophers; Irenaeus confutes many of
their vain opinions; Irenaeus adversus Haereses, l. 2. c. ^9. So Lactantius
institut. l. 3. c. 2. Haereticorum Patriarchae Philosophi. Tertul. l. de anima
c. ^. Plato nem omnium haereticorum condimentum vocat.
Tertullian declaims against them very much, he calls Philosophers the Heretics
Patriarks, because many of the Heretics drew their errors out of their
writings, as the Valentinians, Arrians, Marcionites. etc.

Ans. They speak not against Philosophy, but against some vain Philosophers,
who abused Philosophy, to the maintaining of errors and Heresies. Now a persona
ad rem non valet consequentia, because some men abuse wine, or a sword, it does
not therefore follow that wine is naught, or a sword evil; the fault is in the
person, who abuses the wine to Drunkenness, and the sword to violence.

2. It Is one thing to reject the errors and vanities of Philosophers, Errata
artificum non sunt imputanda ips^ arti, nec Philosopha^^umerr^res ipsi
Philosophiae.
and another thing to reject Philosophy it self; the Fathers condemned the
one, but not the other. Sane and soli^e claris. ille Theolog. Professor; Patres
abusum, non usum legitimum rationis exagitant, nec de vera Philosophia, sed
perperam Philos^phantium fucis, frauae, subtili^ate, aut ignorantia, eorum
dicta sunt intelligenda, etc. Dr ^rideaux. Lect. 14. S. 14 page 227. ubi plura.

The fourth OBJECTION.
The Saints are all taught of God, they have the inward teaching of the spirit,
which is sufficient in it self (^aith Sam: How) Ergo, they need no outward
teaching by men brought up in humane learning

An. Subordinata non pugnant. The outward teaching is subordinate, but not
opposite to the inward; nor does Gods inward teach^ng by his spirit, any way
exclude, but rather include the outward teaching; for whom God teaches now, he
teaches not immediately a^ formerly, but mediately, by means; and therefore
he that promised to teach them by his spirit, promised also to give them
Prophets, Pastors, Teachers, accomplished with all needful abilities for the
better edifying of his Church, Ephesians. 4.11, 12.

2. I answer, a Pari: if humane learning be needless because the spirits
teaching is sufficient, then by the same Argument, natural reason should be
needless; for such as condemn Arts, may as well condemn Reason, for what are
Arts, but Reason brought into rule and order?

The fifth OBJECTION.
Paul counted all but Dung for Christ [ Phil. 3.7, 8.]

But his humane learning was a part of this All; [for he was a Pharisee, and
they excelled in knowledge, and were the chief teachers of it in Christ's time.]

Ergo, he counted it but dung for Christ.

(...) (i) res omnes, eloquentiam, opes, delicias, gloria^, etc pro. Christo
damna, imo ster^^ra existimo. ^ Lap.
Ans. This is a Dunghill-Argument, and is easily answered by limiting the
Major; Paul counted all but dung for Christ comparatively, not simply; and so
when Riches, Pleasures, Honors, etc. come in competition with Christ, they
must be esteemed in comparison of him, as dross and dung: if a man have
riches, he must not cast them away, but he must cast away his confidence in
them; so if he have learning, and skill in Arts, he must not cast it away, (for
in it self it is a good gift of God, Exodus 31.2, 3, 4, 5.) but he must cast
away his pride and glorying in it, Spoliavit se Paulus non opibus. sed perversa
fiducia operum. Calvin.
he must glory in none but Christ; thus Paul cared not to know any thing in
comparison of the excellent knowledge of Christ Crucified, In oratione prima.
1 Cor. 2.2. Thus Nazianzen, a very learned man, accomplished with much Athenian
Eloquence, rejoiced that he had any thing of worth, to esteem as nothing in
comparison of Christ.

The sixth OBJECTION.
From Romans 8.7. The wisdom of the flesh is enmity against God, and 2 Cor.
10.4. The weapons of our warfare are not carnal.

Ans. Learning sanctified is no carnal thing, but the good gift of God, and so
is not enmity to God, but pleasing to him; nor does the Apostle by the wisdom
of the flesh mean Philosophy, but the corruption and depravation of our
natures; and therefore he does not simply condemn wisdom, but fleshly
wisdom, such as proceeds from the pravity of the flesh, and makes us rebel
against God.

2. Though Logic* Philosophy, Rhetoric etc in themse^ves considered are not
able to convert a soul, ^et being spiritualliz'd and improved to the right
opening and expounding of the Scripture* they may be a means the better to
convince our judgments, and work upon our affections, and so help forward our
conversion. Plowing, Sowing, and breaking the clods etc. of it self cannot
make the corn to grow, yet it is a means which God has ordained for that end,
and we must use it if we expect his blessing.

The seventh OBJECTION.
1 Cor 1.17. Paul would not preach the Gospel with the wisdom of words,
Ergo. we may not do it.

Ans. It is one thing to preach in the wisdom of man's words, Taxat Pseuda
postolos quod rhetoricati sint in Christo praedicando neglect a Evangelii
simplicitate. Musculus.
and another thing to make use of learning in our preparations for preaching.
The Apostle therefore does not simply condemn learning, eloquence, freedom of
speech, etc. (which in themselves are the good gift of God) for Paul used much
of it himself, and was able to speak more tongues then they all; but that
which he condemns is vain, affected strains of eloquence, and pompous words,
whereby the simplicity of the Gospel was corrupted, Eloquentia ipsa non est
culpabilis, sed ea male utentium perversitas. Aug.
and souls kept thereby from Christ: Now this is the abuse and not the right
use of learning, which Paul condemns. The Scripture it self is full of Divine
eloquence and Rhetoric See more fully, Mr Perkins on Heb. 11.12. p. 93. Qui
dedit Petrum piscatorem, dedit and Cyprianum rhetorem. Aug.
and it may lawfully be used by a Minister of the Gospel, not for ostentation,
but edification, for being sanctified, it is a furtherance and not a hinderance
to the hearers. Non laudatur ruditas, sed simplicitas; nec vituperatur
eruditio, sed oftentatio; improbat Apostolus non omnem, sed affectatam
eloquentiam, and mixturam sapientiae humanae cum doctrina Evangelii, ut quam
scitissime acutissimus Pareus in locum.

The eighth OBJECTION.
Philosophy is contrary to Divinity^ now contraries (says Sam: How) must not
be put together, but the Gospel and humane learning are contraries, Ergo.

Verum vero contrariari non potest, a^ vera philosophia est veritas Dei, Roma.
18. Deus non est sibi contrarius in lumine naturae and gratiae. Philosophia
sana non pugnat cum Theologia, sed ipsi ancillatur. Alsted.
Ans. Nogatur Minor. Philosophy and humane learning is not contrary, but
subservient; not opposite, but subordinate to the Gospel. [ raetionem
supponit, non opponit, instruit non destruit sacra Theologia] Hence the Lord
often commands us to make use of our Reason* to judge* examine, try al things,
that we may discern truth from falsehood, and light from darkness, Ephesians. 5.9.
and 4.14. 1 Cor. 14.20. See this more fully handled in the first caution
following, etc.

The ninth OBJECTION.
Christ was destitute of humane learning, (says How the Cobbler) yea it is
blasphemy (says he) to affirm he had humane learning; since the Jews admiring,
said, how knows this man letters or learning, having never learned, John
7.15. Its therefore enough (says How) for the Disciple to be as his Lord, he
being destitute of humane learning, his Disciples may well be without it also,
as it appears they were, Acts 4.13.

Ans. Here Is a Cobblers End indeed, had it appeared at another season, it might
have had a fire instead of an Answer. 1. Then I utterly deny that Christ had no
humane learning; Christ and his Apostles made use of tongues and Logic for
opening of the Scripture, some times they make use of the Hebrew Text, and
translate it into Greek, and sometimes they draw logical consequences from the
Old Test. to prove the principles of the New, as Exodus 3.6. compared with Man.
22.32.
for Isaiah 11.2, 3. and 50.4. tells us expressly, that he had the tongue of the
learned given him, and that the spirit of wisdom* understanding, counsel,
might and knowledge should rest upon him, and make him quick of understanding,
and therefore there are said to be hid in him treasures of wisdom and
knowledge, Col. 2.3. Now, how he came by it, whether by infusion from Heaven,
or the personal union, or education at Schools, it is not material* since it is
apparent by Scripture, that he was full of wisdom; insomuch, as the Pharisees
wondered that Christ a Carpenters son, never taught at Schools and Universities,
should be able to speak so learnedly, promptly and fully: now had they not been
grossly blinded by unbelief, they might easily have seen, that since Christ had
not his learning by ordinary and usual means, therefore he had it
extraordinarily, and immediately from God, and so have acknowledged the
evidence of Gods spirit therein.

2. It Is true, the Apostles were unlearned in respect of education. Indoctos
elegit Christus sed oculavit in prudentes; simulque dona dedit and ministeriae.
they were never brought up at Unive^sities, but in respect of inspiration they
were not unlearned; for Christ made them learned, and fitted them before he
sent them; (as I have proved at large in another Treatise) insomuch as the
Scribes wondered at their boldness and abilities, Pulpit Guarded, Ob. 3. p. 53
Acts 4.13. and how, they being unlearned, should come by such learning. In a
word, they were (...), illiterate men, or men without letters, not simply, (for
they had spent some time in studying the Scriptures, and were al (...), taught
of God, Ioh. 45. and 14.26 1 These. 4.9. 2 Pet. 1.21.) but (...), in the
Pharisees esteem they were unlearned, (who conceited that the empire of
learning was within their own dominion) 2. Because they were not brought up in
ordinary Schools of learning, though they were brought up in the School of
Christ, which was incomparably better. The learning is still the same, Nunc cum
confirmatum habeamus Evangelium and ecclesia constable tutam expectare ulterius
Enthusiasmos, neglectis ^ mediis, vertiginosi est cerebelli ad Anticyras potius
quam ad Aegypttos relegandi. D. Pride. conci^. 1.
only the way of attaining it, is different now from what it was in the
Primitive times; Christ, the Prophets and Apostles had it by supernatural and
immediate revelation and infusion, we now by Reading, Teaching, Education,
Study, and Pains, in Schools and Universities.

The tenth OBJECTION.
But there are many errors amongst Philosophers, Poets, Heathens, etc. what
shall we do in such a case?

Ans. The Apostle tells you, 1 These. 5.21. Try all things, and what upon try all
you find to be sound and good, hold that fast. We must therefore read with
judgment, and not like children, swallow all that is put into our mouths; and
this brings me to the cautions, which are ten.

CHAP. III. Ten Cautions.
FIrst, Beware of the two extremes, set not Philosophy, and Arts too high, nor
yet too low; Medio tutissimus ibis. The Anabaptists offend in the Defect, and
totally cry down all humane learning. Others offend in the Excess, preferring
it before Divinity; they set Hagar the servant in the chair, and make Dame
Sarah wait. This is to abuse it, and not to use it: then a thing is abused,
when it is not used in that manner, and for that end to which God has ordained
it; when we set it higher then God would have us, Idolizing it, resting in it.
Philosophy is ordained by God to be an help and furtherance in the study of
Divinity; now when men make it an hinderance to the prejudice of the Scripture,
hurt of the hearers, vainglory in the Teachers, etc. This is to abuse,
Philosophia tanquam famula sit Theologiae subdita; ancilletur, non Dominetur.
not use Philosophy; which ought always to be subservient, but never superior
to Divinity; and therefore when Hagar begins thus to u^urp over her Mistress,
it is time to cast her out till she submit her self. Philosophy is a good
servant, but an ill Mistress to Divinity, and therefore Luther wittily compares
it to the Ass on which Christ rode, which must be subject, not superior to
Christ and his Gospel. It is the folly of many young wits, that they prefer
Aristotle before Paul, and are so wedded to the opinion of the one* that they
scarce ever affect the truth taught by the other, in sincerity: these like
Penelopes suitors, leave the Mistress, and fall in love with the maids. Hear
what the learned a Lapide says in this case; a Lap. com. in Genesis p. 5.
Ancillantur Theologiae quasi Dominae and Reginae omnes liberales disciplinae,
omnes scientiae atque arts, quae certis singulae terminis continentur. Sacra
autem haec scientia ambit omnia, complectitur universa, omniumque usum suo jure
sibi assumit; ut proi^de quasi omnium perfect^ssima, omnium finis and scopus,
ultimo loco veniat addiscenda. Cui suffragatur claris. Walaeus. Arts and
scientiae ancillentur veritati Theologicae, Orat. 1. p. 303.
non praesint; leges ab ea accipiant, nullas praescribant. ^mp^um est humana
inventa caelest^ veritati praeferre aut divina mysteria angustis humant ingenii
mensuris circumscribere; ex hoc vitio pleraeque haereses ortae sunt, etc. Sane
and sci^e ^ic Aquinas. Theologia accipere potest aliquid a Philosophicis
disciplinis, non quod ex necessitate ^is indigeat, sed ad majorem
manifestationem eorum, quae in hac scientia traduntur Non enim accipit sua
principia ab aliis scientiis, sed immediate a De^ per revelationem, and ideo
non accipi^ a^ aliis scientiis tanquam a ^uperioribus, sed ut ^^ur eis tanquam
inferioribus and ancillis, Aquinas 1 par. Q. 1. Art. ^,5. ubi plura Ex
Philosophorum ingeniis omnis haeresis onimatur. Tertullian.
etc.

The second Caution; Beware of mixing and confounding Philosophy with Divinity;
this has brought many Heresies into the Church. This was the fault of the
false Apostles, whom Paul blames, for mixing the works of the Law with Faith,
and bringing Philosophical Tenants into Divinity, and in this kind the
Schoolmen were grossly guilty, Hipotius superstitionibus and subtilitatibus
litant, quam textus simplicitati. Al^ing. Nihil odiosius nimio acumine.
who made Divinity stoop to Philosopy, and went about to prove its deepest
supernatural mysteries, by natural reason out of Aristotle, and so are become
a Dunghill of errors; and are compared by some, to one having bread and good
wine hanging ^on both sides them, yet himself hungrily gnawing a flint stone.
V Bowls Pastor Evangel. l. 1. c. 19. p. 125.
[ Theologiam in mataeologiam converterunt, eorum doctrina Philosophica magis
fuit qua^ Theologica, quique magis ratiunculis humanis* quam testimoniis
divinis nituntur and disputant] We must not bring down the mysteries of
Religion to be scanned by Philosophy, but we must make Philosophy wait and
submit to Divinity. Deceptoria est Philosophia cum sertur extra proprios
limits (i) cumstatuere conatur de illis rebus quae non possunt dijudicari,
etc. Divenant in Col. 2.8. ubi plura.
Every Science must keep its proper bounds, for many things which are true in
Philosophy, yet are not so when applied to Divinity; and e contra. e. g. Ex
nihilo nihil fit, of nothing, nothing is made, this is true in Philosophy, yet
in Divinity we know that God created all things of nothing. So, A privatione
ad haebitum non datur regressus. This is true in Philosophy, and according to
the course of nature; but not in Divinity, since God by his omnipotency works
above nature, and can raise the dead. So the righteousness by which a man is
just and righteous, is inherent in himself, and not in another. So, Virgo non
est matter, nec homo Deus. Philosophice haec sunt vera, non Theologice; Physice,
non hyperphysice. Abusus itaque est cum rerum physicarum propria transferuntur
ad res hyperphysicas. Intra terminos oportet (...), nec licet temere cantare
canticum Domini in terra aliena, ne fiat (...). (i) transitus in aliud genus.

3. Beware of abusing these particular Arts and Sciences. 1. Grammar God has
ordained it as a means to explain phrases and terms in Scripture: now when men
play upon the words, and look more at them, then at the matter, this is an
abuse of the Art: so when men fall to Logomachies, and contending about words,
which Paul condemned, 1 Timothy 6.4. and 2.2, 14.

2. Rhetoric is, a^used when men coin figures, and change the literal into an
Allegorical sense, as Origin did, this is a corrupting of this go^d Art, and
is condemned, Col. 2 4.

3. It Is an abuse of Logic, when by Sophistry and false reasoning, we labor
to draw men into errors. Dialectica ad omnia pexetranda and dissolvenda
plurimum valet; tantum cavenda est libido rixandi, and puerilis quaedam
ostentatio decipiendi adversarium. August. de Doct. Christiana. lib. 2. cap.
31, 32, 33, 34.

4. It Is an abuse of Mathematics, See more fully Mr G^ree against judicial
Astrology. And Mr Waterhouse in that excellent Treatise of his in Defense of
humane learning, p. 30, 31.
(which includes Arithmeticke, Astronomy, and Geometry) when men take upon them
to cast a Figure, or from the Stars, to calculate men's nativities, or to
foretell the states of Kingdoms and Commonwealths; a sin which Gods word often
condemns, and therefore rancks Astrologers with Sorcerers, to whom they are
near allied, Isaiah 47.11, 12, 13, 14*

5. It Is an abuse of Physics, when we pore so much on the Creatures, that we
forget their Creator, and look so much after second causes, that we forget the
first.

6. It Is an abuse of Metaphysics, when men labor by dark terms, Metaphysica
in utramque partem disputat omnia, vix quicquam certi habet, distinctiuncul^s
f^volis and ineptis omnia elidit and eladit, m^^er omnis sophistica and
dec^ptionis. Al^ingius.
improper phrases, idle questions, and vain subtleties, to corrupt the truth,
draw men to Atheism, and make them mere Scepticks in Religion. Sic Scholastici
Doctores in Papa^u Metaphysicis terminis res Theologicas contaminarunt, Pareus
in Col. 2*8. ubi plura. We must therefore bring humane learning home to
Divinity, to be pruned and pared with spiri^uall wised^me, and then it may
lawfully and profitably be used; as the Israelites might not marry with a
Micianite whom they had taken in War, Termini Philoso^hici i^ rebus
Theologicis applicandi, antequa^ (...), ab omni imperfectione liberentur.
Dithmar.
till she was purified. (i) they must shave her head, pare her nails, and put
off the Garment she was taken in, and then they might marry with her, Numb.
31.18, ^9. and Deuteronomy. 21.1^, 12, 13.

4. Beware of Pride in humane learning, let it not so puff you up, that you
cannot submit to the simplicity of the Gospel, 1 Cor. 8.1. for as learning is
the ornament of the mind, so humility is the ornament of learning: many insult
over their brethren, and contemn the people of God that want these
qualifications, like the Pharisees, Ioh. 7.48, 49 Whereas the having of t^o^e
should make us more humble, considering the great account such have to make,
for according to men's gifts, helps and talents, must their account be; they
that have received great abilities, and have either idly buried them, or
basely abused them by drawing ignorant persons into error of life or doctrine,
such shall receive the greater condemnation.

5. We may not stuff our Sermons with Philosophy, though we may use it in our
preparations, yet we must sparingly mention it in public. Peccatur a mu^tis
quod conciones populares mag^s exornen^ poetarum versibus quam Scripturae
testimoniis. Areti. The less color is in the glass, the lighter and better
it is. Pulchre perversa doctrina paleae comparatur quae medullam non habet, nec
potest credentes nutrire. Hieron.
Artis est celare artem. It Is not Aristotle, Tully, Horace, etc. but the holy
Scripture that can convince the judgment, and make it yield: we must therefore
do by our humane learning, as Abraham did by his Ass and his servant. Genesis
22.5. it may go with us, to the foot of the hill, but not ascend into the
Sanctuary. God will have no plowing with an Ox and an Ass, Deuteronomy. 22.9. but if
any man speak, it must be with that fear and reverence, with that preparation
and discretion, as becomes the Oracles of ^od, 1 Pe^. 4.11. for what is the
chafe to the wheat says the Lord? Ier. ^3.28. Quid facit cum Psalterio
Horatius? cum Evangelio Maro? cum Apostolis Cicero? nonne scandalizatur frater
si te viderit in idolioracumbentem? Hieron. Eustachio. Vain Rhetorical,
Tropos ignaris tra^ere non decet, ne artem Grammaticae docere ^id^amur. Aug.
Philosophical florishes do savor of ostentation, wast the time which might
be better spent, and hinders the Edification of the hearers; for as in all
things, so especially in Preaching, all things should be done to edifying, and
therefore it is observed that Gods servants, Moses, Christ Paul etc. though they
were singularly learned, and well accomplished with all kind of learning, yet
they concealed it, and seldom or never showed it in their public preaching,
but came with holy simplicity, and in the demonstration of the spirit; and thus
in our age did holy Perkins, Greenham, Baine, B^field, Sibs, Preston, etc.
Minime probi illorum affectatam vanitatem, qui undique corr^gatis sententiolis
infarciunt suas conciones, scrip^urarum interim prorsus immemores, etc. ut
apposite acutissimus Davenant in Col. 2.8. v. plura Ames. CC. lib. 4. cap. 26.
Q. 6. and Zep. de art concion. l. 2. c. 6.

6. Spend not too much time in them, rest not here; many study Heathens so
long, till they become almost heathenish, like the man that studied
School Divinity so long, that at last he had forgot the Lords Prayer. Many of
Origens errors, came from an over-w^ening love of Philosophy. -- In
Philosophiae indagatione ^^m^um tempo^is ne insumatur, nec speculationibus
^^u^malibus aetas* quae se^i^s impendi deb^t, te^atur. Walae.
(...), Hippocrat. Omne nimium vertisur in vitium. I have known some in my time
in the University, that doted so long on Philosophy, that they proved errant
drones, and could never relish Divinity: what we say of a mere Logician, is
also true of a mere Philosopher, Merus Philosophus, merus Asinus. These studies
are but the elements and preparations only to Divinity, Rudimenta sunt non
opera. Sen.
they are but the way, not our mark and chief end, and therefore our learning
of these Sciences (as Austin well observes) must be modesta and succincta, else
it may prove vinum inebrians, implens non nutriens, infla^s non aed^ficans,
says Bernard. These prepare the wit for higher studies, Praparent ingenium,
non detineant. Sen.
but we must not rest here. Nam si exotica illa cum Scripturae thesauris
comparentur; nihil nisi (...), nugae erunt and quisquiliae, Tilenus. Has itaqu^
disciplinas, paucis* and velut ad majora utilioraque properan^ percurre.
Hyperius de rat. stud. Theolog. l. 1. c. 7. p. 6. ubi plura.

7. I speak not this to discourage any young beginners, (as if I would have
none to be Ministers* but such as can read a Lecture in Philosophy) who strive
and study for competent abilities, in Arts and Languages, nor any who have
real abilities, and shall be judged sit by a Presbytery, and so called to the
Ministry, Philosophia Theologo est necess^ria non (...) sed (...), non quoad
(...), sed (...), (i) non quoad notitiam simpli cem and absolutam, s^d quoad
no^itiam pleniorem and solidiorem. Dithma^.
though for the present they be defective this way: for humane learning does
not empower, but fits us to preach; it does not make us Ministers, but it
makes us able Ministers of the Gospel: it is necessary, not simply ad esse, to
the being, but ad b^ne esse to the well being of a Preacher: it is requisite
necessitate expedientiae and (...)* non necessitate absoluta, as if a man could
know nothing in Divinity without it. ^he wan^ of it is a blemish and defect,
which by all good means we should labor to remove; for though a man may be a
Preacher and a Disputant without it, yet he shall never be so complete a
Preacher, not dexterous a Disputant, as he that has it: and therefore I would
advise all such, (I have known some that having strong natural part^, in a
short time have gained good insight in the Arts and Languages) though they
cannot attain that perfection which others have, yet to get such a competent
measure of knowledge herein, as to be able to help themselves, and to see with
their own eyes, and when doubts arise, not to be quite to seek, else the
profane of the world will soon di^cover their weakness, and they shall be sure
to hear of it to their sorrow, unless they be very humble, gracious, and wise
to prevent it* etc. v. plura apud Claris. Hyperium. l. 1 c. 7. p 60.

8 Get your learning sanctified; a learned head and an unsanctified heart is a
fit instrument for the Devil to do much mischief withal: such often prove the
^o^est enemies to Religion; who more learned then the Egyptians, yet who more
gross Idolateis, and greater enemies to Gods people? Who more learned then the
Scribes and Pharisees, yet who more graceless in their lives ^ Paul meets with
most opposition at Athens, amongst the learned Philosophers, Acts 17. So true
is the Proverb, the learned Clerks, are not always the wisest men, they are
like an Ass deck^ with costly ornaments. Literatus stultus, phaleratus Asinus.
All the humane learning in the world cannot bring a man to salvation, it may
help to curb corruption civilize a man, and prepare him for better things, but
it is the saving knowledge of the word, which gives more grace, James 4 6.
there only true comfort is to be found; hence it is called by way of exclusion,
The word of life, and the word of comfort, excluding all true comfort from any
other word or writings, E^si illa naturalis cognitio usum suum insignem habet,
sine Theologiae tamen supervent^ salutaris esse non potest. Qumtum ergo corpus
ani^ae, terrena coelestih^s, externa and fragili^ ae^^ni^ and spi^itualibus
^edunt; tantum caeterae omnes scientiae hu^^ c^dere libe^^er debent. Wall.
which has made the Godly to prefer it before all the treasures in the
world. We should therefore moderate our delight in other studies, and make
them all subservient to this; for this is not the end of our lives to get
humane learning* nor must it be preferred, much lest be equallized to the
knowledge of God in his word, but always kept in subordination to it; else
what will it profit us to be good Grammarians, and have skill in tongues, to
have our he^^s full of knowledge, and our hearts empty of all goodness; or to
be good Logicians, and ^ki^^ull in answering fallacies, yet suffer the Devil
to delude us with his sophistry, or to be good Historians, and know what is done
abroad, yet be ignorant of the state of our souls at home, etc. Consider that
humane learning is but a common gift of the spirit, which is often bestowed on
Reprobates and Heathens, as well as on Gods people; and therefore the Lord in
his wisdom often passes by the learned, proud, selfe-conceited Rabbis of the
time, and chooses the poor, the simple, and meek of the earth, to set forth his
praise, 1 Cor. 1.26, 27.

9. Yet beware of offending in the defect: Maneat usus, tollatur abusus.
Let not the abuse of any thing, take away the lawful and sober use of it. God
would have us to use all helps, (for now we have nothing by Inspiration,
Revelation, or any such extraordinary way, but all by study, pains and
industry) he would have us make use of our Reading and Reason, and not be like
Horse and Mule, which have no understanding, Psalm. 32.9. nor like children
tossed to and fro with the delusions of men. Ephesians. 4.1^. The worship which he
calls for, must be (...), rationalis (i) agreeable to right reason.

Away then with those Fanatics, Enthusiasts, Anabaptists etc. who boast of the
spirit, and of their revelations (the common (...), and refuge, when they are
at a stand for Scripture to prove their errors, then they fly to Revelations,
as the Papists when nonplust, fly to traditions) and under this pretense, they
cry down Languages, Arts, Sciences, Universities, etc. But let their pretenses
be never so specious, they are but back friends to Religion, that decry humane
learning. Iulians Edict forbidding Christians the use of Schools, and exercises
of Learning, was esteemed a more dangerous engine to overthrow the Christian
Faith, then all the bloody persecutions of his predecessors, etc.

Certainly much respect is to be given to the learning and godliness of men.
There is a great delusion in many men's hearts, that makes them think it to be
half Popery, to give any respect to learning; although the abuse of learning
has done much evil, against that much has bin* and may be said: but I dare
avow this, that never since the beginning of the world could a man be found to
speak against learning, but an ignorant ^an; neither is it like; nay I may aver
it it is impossible, that any but such will be found to the end of the world;
learning has so much of God in it, that it never had, nor will have any enemy
but ignorance, etc.

When we see grace added to learning, it should add much to our esteem of such
a man, it is the orient pearl in the gold ring, etc. Buroughs Irenicum, chap.

Sam: How the Preaching Cobbler, or the Cobling Preachers Epitaph, by R. O.
WHat How? how now: has How such learning found,
To shrow Arts curious Image to the ground?
Cambridge and Oxford may their glory now,
Veil to a Cobbler, if they knew but How:
Though big with Arts, they cannot overtop,
The Spirits Teaching in a Cobblers shop.
Reader, if thou an humane Artist be,
Let humane learning be no judge for thee:
Lay down thy Arts, then try this Cobblers End,
And see, if it be by the Spirit penned.
Mean time adue, ye Arts and A^^ists all,
The Spirits teaching may attend the Aull;
And thou brave Cobbler blow another blast
Upon their learning, though thou blow thy Last.
R. O.

An Answer to R. O. his Verses made in commendation of a Book of Samuel How, a
Cobbler.
Who Is this, R. O. a Psychopannychist,
Rather the la^e Pamphleting Mortalist?
If it be He, no wonder that he so
Admire the Cobbler* and even kiss his Toe;
And nothing make of ^' University,
Compared with his Awll-suffic^ency.
It Is just with God, ^ha^ he that vilifies
The glorious Sun should ^lowwormes Idolize;
And he that smells no sweetness in a Rose,
Should judge a Dunghill fittest for the nose,
And he that Mortal ma^^s the Soul* should call
This Samuel H^w, Doctor Angelical,
Yea think this Sa^u^ll Prophesies as well,
As ever did the Prophet Samuel.
Indeed for Mortal Souls he is as fit
As lasts can be for sho^es or sho^es for feet:
And fitter then the noble ^ Muses Sonn^s,
All whose brave blood, a course Immortal runs;
Except this one degenerate, R. O.
Who may unto his learned Cobbler go,
And to his cure with his old sh^oes commend
His deca^d Soul, since Sam: can both amend.
Doubtless he will do thus; and perhaps too,
He will at last be taught to patch a shoe;
And to his end prof^ss a Cobbler be,
Imagining some rare D^vinity
Lies in that Art, where men have every hour,
Fresh charge of soles, and over them such power.
I wish he may wax wiser. But if he,
For Sam: How Is sake, will needs a Cobbler be,
Let him be one in grain Sam: has set forth
A k^ocking p^^ce of wo^ke, of lasting worth;
Which ought to be dispe^sed by Transl^tions,
For Englands honor and the good of Nations.
T^is let R. O. Latinis^e: then all
May him Translatour ^f Translatours call.

On Samuel How the Cobbler, lately turned Preacher, etc.
WHo is sufficient for the M^nistry?
Cried once the Gentiles Doctor. That am I,
Thinks every Tradesman in these dregs of Time.
Even How the Cobbler dares the Pulpit climb.
Belike he thinks the difference is but small
Between the sword of the Spirit and the Awle.
And that he can as dexterously divide
The word of truth, as he can cut an Hide:
And that the souls of people cannot choose,
But be as tractable as the soles of Shoes.
In time perhaps he may his error see,
And say, none ever was more deceived then He.
The faults of shoes he does no sooner spy,
But he knows how to cure them presently.
The faults of men he may his spirits spend
Upon, and irritate, but not amend.
It Is not so easy in the Ministry,
To set men Upright that do tread awry,
As in the Gentle Craft. The holiest Hearts
Ioin'd with the greatest prudence, pains and parts,
Have, often complained that they could do no good,
On this and that and the other piece of wood.
Our shoes are soon prevailed with, to quit
Their ancient soles, and new ones to admit.
Men will not be so soon persuaded to
Put off the old Man, and put on the New.
But we may fear, that How* and such as He,
Mechanics, that invade the Ministry,
Have no such end* as sinners to convert,
But (O mischievous madnesse^) to pervert
Such as are converts, or are coming on
In a fair way toward Conversion.
They press not the New Man, but such New Ways,
As lead men from the Ancient of Days.
Whether we New Creatures be or not, we see
They do not care, so we their Creatures be.
Against our Reverend Clergy they inveigh,
Because it is a Mountain in their way.
Could they remove that once, all would be theirs;
The Fathers outed* they should be brave Heirs.
Just such as Absalom, had he overthrown
His Father David, and p^ss^ss'd his Thr^ne.
The l^berall Arts they likewise do decry,
Those needful Hand-ma^ds to Divinity.
This high bo^n Lady, they would leave as bare
As new shorn Sheep, or naked Indians are.
The Spirit they say sufficient is They might
Say too, the Mo^n affords sufficient light,
Without this Train of Stars; ye Stars be gone;
We Will be contented with the Moon alone.
But against learning would they blaterate,
Unless themselves were so illiterate?
The Ape much fault with Foxes tail does find,
Because himself can nothing show behind.
The Fox those Grapes does greatly vilify,
Though never so precious that do hang too high.
Could tails he had, they would well enough please Apes;
And Foxes could they reach them would praise grapes.
These Animals too, had they the Arts they want,
They would them prize, and scorn the ignorant.
To strike all dead, those Pillars of our Land,
Jachin and Boaz may no longer stand
Tabor and Hermon, mountains that maintain
The gowned Nation they would make a Plain.
What need, say they, of the two fold Athens now,
Or Mothers Breasts, when we past children grow?
Our Land can now well spare those two great Eyes.
Yes, so it can, if it will Heathenize.
I Am sure it may well spare such Mouths. If God
Permit them long, we may cry^ Ichabod.
For such wild Preachers, whatsoever they say,
Will Preach true Preaching, and even Christ away.

To the Candid and Courteous Reader.
Reader,
WHen I had perused the Theological Rules of Mr* Wilson, which came but lately
to my hands by reason of their scarcity, they being Printed 1615. I conceived
it might be an acceptable service to the Public, to Reprint them with some
additionall Rules; Ignorantia scripturarum peperit haereses. Chrysostom.
especially now, when errors abound so much through ignorance of such Rules.
But when I perceived by the Printers, that the Press at this time (when
Trading is so dead) would not bear the volume, I was constrained to take
another course, and to set forth my own Rules single by themselves; yet have I
given the succum and sanguinem, the Marrow of Mr Wilson's Rules, there is not a
rule of his, that is very material, but thou have it virtually, though not
literally here. These Rules I have been gathering many years for my own
private use; here thou have them enlarged with references (for brevities sake)
to such as handle any Rule more fully. To them is added an Alphabeticall Table,
which will be very useful for the finding out of any thing that is material.
I have also added many Tropes and Figures, with explanations of the quotations
where need required, etc. Now the blessing of God go with it, and give it
favor in the eyes of his people, the Lord make it mighty and succesfull for
the destruction of sin and Satan's Kingdom, and for the advancement of the

Rules to be observed for the right Interpretation of Scripture.
FIrst, They that would understand the meaning of Gods spirit, must be men of
spiritual minds, Sit men's nostra terrena faece perpurgata, passionum discussis
nebuli^, sancta and sublimis e^^ecta, ut apta* habilisque reddatur ad coeles^ia
haec dogmata ba^ri^da. a Lap. Deus amicis suis arcana animi sui communicate.
John 15.15.
1 Cor. 2.15. the spiritual man (i) the regenerate man judges all things (i)
he is not only certain of the truth which himself holds, but he can also
judge and clearly discern the errors that are held by others. They have
received an Unction from the holy one (1) they have the holy spirit of God, and
this benefit they have by him, that they know all things, [1 John 2, 26, 27.]
not simply all things that are knowable, but all things that are necessary to
salvation; and herein the poorest Idiot (being a sound Christian) goes beyond
the profoundest Clerks that are not sanctified; for he has his own heart
instead of a Commentary, ^o help him in the understanding of the most needful
points in Scripture. He then that would interpret Scripture, Sine pur^ m^nte
and Sanctorum imitation^, nemo compre^enderit Sanctorum verba. Athanas. D^us se
puris videndum praebet in verb^ suo in ^ac vita, and visione gloriosa ^n sutura
Mat* 5 8. Rive. Nunquam Pauli sen^um ingreduris, nisi Pauli spiritum im^ib^ris.
Be^.
must come with a Scripture-frame of Spirit; he must have a holy and heavenly
heart, suitable to the holiness and Heavenlinesse that is in the word. The
Scriptures spiritualnesse, calls for a heart filled with Scripture
spiritualnesse, to set forth its excellencies: for as no man can rightly sing
David's Psalms, without David's spirit; so no man can rightly expound the Word
of God without the spirit of God. Carnal, sensual hearts, and such divine,
spiritual work, will never agree. A vessel that is full of poison, cannot
receive pure wa^er; or if it could, yet the Vessel would ^aint it.

Sincerum est nisi vas, quodcunque insundis acessi^. Hor.

It Is the nature of the Word to be facile and comfortable to such as are of a
semblable disposition to it, [ Micah 2.7.] but dark, Luce^ Scriptura, sed fi^is
lucis. Tilen. Pium and prudentem requirit lectorem.
harsh, and hard to the wicked, unregenerate, unmortified men. Sin in the
affection, will quickly breed error and darkness in the understanding; Pride,
Covetousness, etc. blind the judgment, John 5.44. Luke 16.14. We must be
renewed in the spirit of our minds, before ever we can prove what is that good
and perfect will of God, Romans 12.2. for the secrets of the Lord are revealed to
none but such as fear him. Psalm. 25.12, 14. Pro. 1.7. and 9.10.

2 Rule. He that would know the mind of God in Scripture, must earnestly beg
for the direction and assistance of the spirit of God, Been orasse est been
studuisse. Luther. Vbi Deus Magister est, quam ci^o discitur, quod docetur.
Leo. V. Bowls Pastor Evangel. page 117.
that so he may be taught of God, to know and do his will. Nature is blind
here, 1 Cor. 2.14. the natural man perceives not the things of God: he may
peradventure know the History, but not the Mystery; he may read the words, but
shall never savingly know the mind of Christ without his spirit: it is this
Eye Salve which must make us see, and lead us into all truth. We must therefore
take David's course, go unto God by Prayer, Hanc veram sapientiam non lectio
docet, sed unctio; non litera, sed spiritus; non eruditio, sed exercitatio in
mandatis Domini. Ber. in Canto Ser. 37. Sine s^iritu arcana spirit^s quaerere,
nihil est aliud quam fine luce videre velle. Rive.
and beseech him to inlighten thy understanding, that thou may see into
those deep mysteries, and wonders of his Law, [ Psalm. 119.18.] He that would
have this wisdom, must ask it of God; for the Scripture can never be rightly
interpreted without the assistance and teaching of that spirit, by whom they
were inspired that wrote them. No Scripture is of private interpretation, [2
Pet. 1.20*] that is private which is merely of man, as ver. 21. private is not
here opposed to public, but to divine, or to the holy Ghost: Now our
interpretations coming from the spirit, are falsely called private, because
it is that spirit teaches us, which teaches all the faithful. This is the
chiefest work, and as it were the foundation of all the rest, without which all
other means are vain, O^ationi lectio, l^ctioni succedat^o^ati^, Hie. od
I^aetam. Ad mentis puri^at^m industria and ex^rcitati^ diligen^ ^st ad^ungenda.
Rive. ^sagog ad script. cap. 18 p. ^59.
therefore begin and end with Prayer.

Now though a man be Godly, and have the spirit, yet he must use the means
which God has ordained for the right understanding of Scripture, for God will
be found only in his own way.

3. The Original languages must be studied, Non est in lege vel una litera ^
qua non montes magni dependeant. Rabbin.
they have many special Ididioms, proprieties, phrases and elegancies, which
cannot be fully expressed in our own o^ any other language, and therefore it is
necessary that we understand them in some competent measure; that so in our
doubts we may have recourse to the fountain it self, Hebraei sontes hibunt,
Graeci (1.) Sept. rivo^, Latini paludes. Sphinx.
from whence the waters drink most sweetly. The ignorance of Greek and Hebrew
has been the cause of many errors in the Ancients, and especially amongst
Monks and Friars. Bonus Grammati^us, bonus Theologus.
Till we understand the words; we can never find out the sense; nor without
them shall we be able to defend our selves, or offend an enemy. To give an
instance or two, Bell. lib. 2 c. 12. de verbo Dei See more, D^ Prideaux*
fascicul. Q 5. p. 36.
Genesis 3.15. the Vulgar Latin, Bellarmine, and the School-boyes of D^way, say,
[ ipsa] she shall break; we say ipse, he shall break. Now by having recourse
to the Original, the doubt is e^sily answered. The pronoun is Masculine [
^His] he, Evincit hoc Do^tis. P^rcus R^^. 8. in locum.
or it, (i) the seed, Zera, which in the Hebrew is of the Masculine Gender:
it is not [ H^] she, in the Feminine Gender: the promise is confined to Christ,
the promised seed, this glory must not be given to his Mother, who ingenuously
confesses him to be a Savior to her self, as well as unto others, Luke 1.47.
Thus the Rhemists would prove free will from that Text, Luke 2.14. Peace on
earth, to men of good will; but what says the Original? the word is (...),
which signifies Gods free love to us, but never our free will to good. So
Ephesians. 2.10. the Vulgar Latin says we are Gods workmanship created in Christ,
in operibus bonis, in good works; but our Translation says, to good works; and
so says the Original, (...), ad, non in.

Besides the tongues, a sound and solid interpreter had need of Rhetoric to
understand Tropes and figures which are frequent in Scripture: also Logic to
Analyze a Text, Philosophy, natural moral, oeconomicall, with some knowledge
in ecclesiastical Histories; all which rightly improved will give us great
light into the Scripture.

4. Ever observe very carefully the circumstances in a Text; Quis, cui, causa,
locus, quo tempo^c, prima. Sequela.
as who speaks, when, to whom, the scope, the end, the matter, especially
observe the context what goes before, and what follows. The Rule of the
Lawyers hold well here, Iudicandum non est de jure ex sola line a. We must not
judge of the Law by one line, Vt absque fundamento imbecilla est aedificatio,
ita nisi invento scopo Scriptura est mutilis. Chrysostom. Ex antecedentibus and
consequentibus colligitur verus Scripturae sensus. Aug. Vide Hyperiu^ de
ratione studii Theolog. lib. 2. cap. 11. and Illyricum Tract. 1. page. 20, etc.
See m^^^ fully Master Roberts Preface to the Key of the Bible. page 43. and
Bernards Faithful Shepherd lib. 4 cap. 2. page 188.
but observe the drift and scope of the place; this gives great light to a
Text, and helps to overthrow many errors. One sound Reason thus drawn from
Scripture, is of more worth and strength then the opinions of a thousand
Chrysostoms, Origens, Austins, etc. Remember this distich of Glassius, Quis,
scopus, impellens, seeds, tempusque, locusque, and modus; haec soptem,
scripturae attendito loctor. The Author, Scope, occasion, Theme, Time, Place;
and next, the Form, these seven let him attend that reads the Text.

The Scripture lies not in the naked words, Ne putemus in verbis Scripturarum
esse Evangelium, sed in sensu; non in superficie, sed in medulla, no^ in
sermonum foliis, sed in radice rationis. Hieron. in Gal. 2.
or letters, but in the true senic and scope of the words, there lies the life
and soul of the Scripture. Men's legis est lex: not the bare words, but the
meaning of the law is the Law.

5. Dark and hard places are to be expounded by plain ones* for the Scripture
is both Text and glos^e, Vnus locus per pl^ra intelligi debet, obscura per
apertiora. Aquinas pars 1. q. 1. aut 9. Scriptura est catenae similis, quae
tota si^i ^o^s^et Chrysostom. Magnifice and salubriter SS^a Scriptu^as modifi^avit,
ut locis ap^rtioribus fami occurreret, obscuri^ribus autem ^astidia deterge^et
nihil ^nim ^ere de illis obscuritatibus eruit quod non plam^ssime dictum alibi
reperiatur. Aug lib. ^. cap. 6. de doctr. Christiana. Moris est Scripturarum
obs^uris manifesta Sub^ict^re. Scriptura est oration una copulativa, qu^r^^ ^na
pars confirmat, clucidat. exponit alieram. (...)
and ever has light in some place, to clear the darknes^e of others: one
Scripture often expounds, but never contradicts another. Amicae semper
Scripturarum lites. In Scripture there are places where the Lamb may wade, and
the Elephant may swim; some places are clear and plain to instruct our
ignorance, others are dark and difficult, [2 Pet. 3.16.] to quicken our
diligence, to make us dig and N^n dixit ligite Script^ras, sed s^rutamini (i)
cum labor and diligentia ^ffodite arcanos Scriptura^am ^hes^ur^s, (...) qu^m
v^a^ metall^^^ aurum and argentum studiose scrutantu^. Chrysostom.
search, [ John. 5.39.] to make us fervent in Prayer, humble in meditation, to
make us prize his word, which contains in it such high and heavenly mysteries,
and to work in us a love to the Ministry, which God has set apart for the
opening of these mysteries. If ever we would be good Interpreters, we must often
compare one place with another, and dark places with plain; for what is
obscure in one place, is made plain in another, so that the Scripture is the
best expounder of it self. thus Isa 51.1. look to the rock from whence you
were hewne; what is that? ver. 2. to Abraham your Father, and Sarah your Mother.
So Ioh. 6. Christ having spoken of eating his flesh, presently adds, that he
spoke of a spiritual, not a corporal eating. Thus the Lord in his wisdom
has left some things dark to exercise us, that by search and comparing it with
other Scriptures, we might be at last acquainted with the whole Scripture, and
not rest contented with the knowledge of some part of it, but might have it
richly dwelling in us. Hence he makes the Prophets to expound Moses, See more
Bernards Fai^hfull Shepherd. l. 4. c. 2. p. 192.
and the Old Testament is explained in the New. e. g. Exodus 3. I am that I am;
what is that? the Prophet Isaiah will tell you, Isa. 48. I am the first and the
last, (i) the eternal Jehovah. Thus Christ confutes the Devil by comparing
one place with another, Mat. 4.7. Those holy Levit^s, Mephorac^ exponendo
sensum dabant intelligentiam per scripturam* (...) collatis testimoniis
demonstrans; C^rti facti ex collatione Scripturarum. See more fully Roberts
Key. p. 59. Rule 8.
Nehemiah 8.7, 8 and Paul in the Acts 9.22. and 16.10. They gave the sense,
comparing Scripture with Scripture. Parallel Texts (like glasses) set one
against another, cast a mutual light, and as the Lapidary brightneth his hard
Diamond with the dust shaved from it self: so must we clear hard Scriptures by
others that are plain and perspicuous, as an Trap. com. on Mat. 4.7.
acute and pious Divine has well observed.

6. We must beware of taking those words literally, which are to be understood
figuratively, or of taking things figuratively, In Scriptura explicanda
manifesta est haeresis sicut figurata proprie accipere, ita quae sunt proprie
dicta ad Tropicam locutionem detorquere. Aug. de Doct, christ. l. 3. See more,
Weemse 1 Vol. p. 231, 232, etc. Vbi male nemo pejus.

Fas est interpreti ex duabus interpretationibus cum utraque textui congruit,
alter utram absque vitio sequi. Ravenel.


when they should be interpreted literally; we may not make figures where the
Scripture makes none, nor make it bleed with straining it too hard. This was
Origens fault, sometimes he would take that literally, which was to be
understood mystically; thus mistaking that place, Matthew 19.12. He gelt
himself; and many times he allegorizeth even plain Scripture, and therefore
often misseth the true sense. Now if a word admit of many significations, by
the scope and circumstances of the place we may find, which is the most proper
signification; and where the Text will bear it, we may make use of both.

7. All all our expositions must agree with the Analogy of Faith, Romans 12. 6.
We must Prophecy according to the proportion or analogy, 2 Timothy 1.13. Heb.
6.1. Per analogiam intelligimus non tanti^m quod totidem verbis express in
SSreporitur, sed etiam quicquid ex iis (...). per consequentiam necessariam
deducitur D. Morton, Apolog. Analogia est cum veritas unius Scripturae
ostenditur veritati alterius non repugnare. Aq^ p. 1. q 1. art. 10. See more,
Bernards Faithful Shepherd. l. 4. c. 2. p. 184.
[(...)] of Faith; which is nothing else but the constant tenor of the
Scripture, in the plain points of Religion, as the Articles of our Faith, the
Lords Prayer, the Creed, and the fundamentals in our Catechi^e, all which are
proved by clear Scripture. Now in expounding, still have an eye to this, and
know, that what ever interpretation contradicts this Analogy of Faith, is
always false. e. g. this is my body, it cannot be true literally, because it
is contrary to the Analogy of Faith, which tells us that Christ's humane nature
is ascended into Heaven, and the heavens must contain him till his second
coming, Acts 3.21. it must therefore be understood figuratively. So Romans
12.20. to feed our enemy, and give him drink, are to be taken literally;
because they are agreeable to the Analogy of Faith; but to heap coals of fire
on his head, must be taken figuratively, because in the letter it is contrary
to the sixth Co mandement, So Mat. 5. 29. We should therefore take special
care to be well grounded in the fundamentals and principles of Religion; for
ignorance is virtually every error. Mat. 22.29, ye err not knowing the
Scripture: and seminally it is every sin, this made Paul a persecutor, 1 Timothy
1.13. and the Jews to crucify Christ, Acts 3.17.

8. You must come to this work, with an humble heart. S. licet per se
clarissima, suverbis tamen est abscura ob little caecitatem and pravum af^ectum.
Luth.
Purge out all pride, selfe-conceitednesse, and prejudicate opinions, lay aside
all by-ends and aims, become a fool in thy self, that thou may be wise in
God, submit thy judgments, will and affections to his his will, and then he
will teach thee, Ps. 25.9 Isay, 28 9. Mat. 11.25. God will not vouchsafe to
show us so much as the form of his house, till we are humbled, Ezekiel. 43.11.
Matter omnium Haereticorum superbia. Aug. SS. Vult in ^imore and humilitate
tractari, and magis studio piae orationis penetrari, quam acumine ingenii. L^
de scrip. Sicut Demost in eloquentia, pronunciationi primas, secundas, tertias
de dit: ita ego in Christi sapientia primas, secundas tertias, dabo humilitati,
quam Dominus noster ut doceret* humiliatus est nascens, vivens, mor^ens. Aug.
A proud person is fit to make an heretic, he does not take the sense which
Scripture yields, but impo^eth his sense upon it; he is ready to interpret that
for Gods will, which is most suitable to his own, Psalm. 50.21. these like the
spider, turn all to poison. Get an humble heart, and then thou will look on
every truth of God, as infinitely above thee, and so wilt willingly receive it
from any; even a child with Scripture-Reasons may lead thee, Veniat, venias
verbum Domini, and submittemus ei, sexcenta si nobis essent colla. Mel. Ada.
Isa. 11.6 then, and never till then, will thou say with Baldassar, a Germane
Divine, let the word of the Lord come, let it come, had we six hundred necks,
they should all submit to it. We must not do (as many do in our days) who
bring the Scripture in subjection to their opinions, conceits and practices, Is
optimus interpres qui sensum e scriptura potius retulerit, quam attulerit,
Hilar.
when they should humbly and readily conform their opinions and practices to
the scripture.

9. Ignorant persons that cannot use these means, must go to such as are
godly, and have skill, as the blind man that cannot see himself, will seek out
for a guide. Man. 2.7. the Priests lips must preserve knowledge, and the people
must seek Gods Law at his mouth. They must read good books, get sound
Commentators, confer much, humbly suing to God for direction, who first or
last will resolve our doubts. To the diligent hand that makes rich in
spirituals as well as temporals, and if we be active for knowledge, and in
despite of all oppositions, can follow on to know the Lord, he has then
promised that we shall Cognitione approbationis, no^ apprehensionis
experimentali and affectiva, non discursiv^
know him, Hos. 6.3. If we be diligent in searching, God will be faithful in
revealing; and if we sincerely do our duty, we shall quickly find the blessing.

Bonum est scire and sequi.
10. Practice the truth, when the Lord shall make known any truth to you,
presently obey it, and submit to it, so shall you know more of Gods mind, John
7.17. Via recte judi candi de doctrina est, si praepa^etur animus ^^udio
placendi Deo and faciendi ipsius volunta tem. Rolloc. in Job.
when our workings and walkings be Scripture-explications. God then delights
to reveal himself unto us: if David will but keep the precepts of the Lord, he
shall be wiser then the Ancient, wiser then his Teachers, [ Psalm. 119.98.99,
100.] and wiser then his subil^ enemies. Oh then let our practice come up to
our light, and our Gospell-principles be answered with Gospell-conversations,
and our Gospell-light, with Gospel lives; for then the Lord finding us
faithful in a little, will show us yet greater things, Phil. 3.15. and if we
be careful to obey his truth, he has then promised to give us his spirit, [
Acts 5.32.] which shall be in us a spring of illumination, sanctification,
consolation, etc.

11. Words of knowledge imply affection and practice, Recordatio Dei notat
cu^um Dei: ut impii oblivisci Deo dicu^tur. Sibel.
Ec^l. 12.1. Remember (i) know, fear, love and obey God. So 1 Cor. 11.24. do
it in remembrance of me; (i) with care, fear, love, delight; for it is not a
bare Historical remembrance, but a sin crucifying, soul-affecting remembrance.
So Deuteronomy. 8 11, 18. Psalm. 1.9, 17. and 106. 21. and 1.6. 2 Timothy 2 19.

12. The Hebrews instead of an Epithet, Vanitas vanitatum, est Hebr. (i) summa,
vanissima vanitas. v. a Lap. in Eccles. 1.2. ubi plura.

Homo ille merum scelus: haec enim est vis idiotismi Hebraeici. Beza.

Col. ^.13. filius dilectionis (i) dilectus and 3.12. viscera misecordiae (i)
visceralem misericordiam.


do put the substantive in the genitive case; as men of mercy, for merciful
men a land of desolation (i) a very desolate land, a man of desires, (i) a man
very desirable and lovely, Dan. 9.23. the son of perdition (i) one ordained for
damnation, John 17.12. The man of sin, 2 These. 2.3. there is an emphasis in it
(i) a very sinful man, a man made up of wickedness, being as it were sin it
self in the abstract. So Benmavoth, a son of death, 1 Samuel 20.31. (i) one that
shall surely dye; a son of Belial (i) one notoriously wicked, 1 Samuel 2.12. so
Ephesians. 2.3. children of wrath. (i) by nature we are all poor, damned, undone
creatures' It Is an Hebraifme very frequent in Scripture: hence Christ is called
a man of sorrows, Isaiah. 53.3. (i) a man even compacted and compounded of all
kinds and degrees of sorrows. Vir dolorum (i) undique doloribus obsi^us, ex
doloribus conflatus, and non nisi dolor, imo pelagus dolorum esse videretur. ^
Lap.
So Jeremy (15.10.) was counted a man of contentions (i) an exceeding
contentious man: thus Genitives are put for Adjectives, and do increase the
signification.

13. One proper name is often given in Scripture to several persons: as the name
of Pharaoh, Pharaonis vocabulum non persona^, sed dignitatem notat.
was a common Title to all the Kings of Egypt; Joseph stands before one
Pharaoh, Moses is sent to another, etc. V. Ravanel. in verbo Pharao.
Writers observe ten of that name in Scripture, as the Philistines called their
Kings Abimelech, and the Romans called their Emperors, Caesar; so the
Egyptians called their Kings by the name of Pharaoh. Thus we read of three
Herod's. 1. Herod the Ascalonite, in whose reign Christ was born. Mat. 2.1. 2.
Herod the Tetrarch, who beheaded John. 3. Herod Agrippa, who killed James, Acts
12.

14. When a Text admits of several interpretations, which must I choose? 1.
Observe the Context, the scope and drift of the place, and see which exposition
agrees best with that, and cleave to that; its stronger then the sayings of a
thousand Origens, Austins, etc. 2. Observe which agrees best with the Analogy
of faith, and other places of Scripture. e. g. Pro. 25.21, 22. Romans 12.20. If
thy enemy hunger, feed him, etc. by so doing thou shall heap coals of fire on
his head: Some by coals here understand, coals of confusion; Intellige
carbones ignis esse urentes poenitent ae gemitus, quibus superbia sanatur ejus
qui dolet se inimicum f^isse hominis a quo ejus m^s^ri^e seri^ subvem^ur. Aug.
de Doct. Christ. l. 3. cap. 16.
others coals of conversion; though both may stand, yet the last is far more
safe and genuine 1. Because it agrees best with the Context, which forbids
private revenge, and commands us to love our enemies, as ver, 19. before the
Text, and ver. 21. after plainly show, be not overcome with evil, but overcome
evil with good, (i) by thy goodness, and unexpected kindness, thou shall so
melt and humble him, (as a great fire makes the hardest Iron and Steel to melt)
that of a foe he shall become a friend. 2. This exposition is most agreeable to
the Analogy of faith, which commands us to love our neighbor, yea though he be
our enemy, and to seek his good, but never his ruin: now that sense which calls
us from malice to charity, is ever best. Thus that act of Naaman, [2 Kings
5.17, 18.] in going to the house of Rimmon, is very much controverted; some say
he sinned in so doing, others as godly and as learned, say no: what shall we
here do? scan the Text, and we shall find it probable, that he did not sin:
For 1. It Is concluded by all, that Naaman was a true convert, and the Text
clears it. 1. He will do nothing without the Prophets direction and
approbation. 2. Whereas before he was an Idolater, and sacrificed to
false-gods, now he resolves to worship only the true God. ver. 17. and if so,
is it likely that he would desire a toleration to sin? or does he not rather
beg pardon for his former Idolatry; for the words may be read in the Preter
Tense, as well as in the Future. q. d. the Lord pardon thy servant, that when
my Master went to the house of Rimmon to worship there, and leaned on my hand,
and I bowed my self, Fuit curvatio Politica and civilis, non ^eligiesa. ^ Lap.
Obsequium suit Domino debitum a ser^ o, id^o null a ^ege prob^itum. Sanctius*
etc. 3. Naamans bowing, was not a Religious worship given to the Idol, (for he
had openly disclaimed all Idolatry before) but his bowing was only in a civil
respect, that the King might lean on his shoulders, and this he did, (as Mr
Perkins well observes) with open and public protestation, that he would
worship none but the true God, and therefore to him he resolves to build an
Altar in his own Country. Haee verba sunt ejus, qui postulata concedit. San.
4. The Prophet would never have bid him go in peace, had he begged for a
toleration in Idolatry; for what peace can there be to the wicked?

Ob. He begs for pardon, therefore he sinned in what he did.

Ans. He being tender conscienc'd, Consule G. Abbat Praelect. 42 p. 160, etc.
and scrupulous (as most young converts are) craves pardon for this his bowing,
though but in a civil respect, as fearing it might be interpreted a Religious
worshipping of the Idol, etc. This is a charitative interpretation, and they
say it is best offending on this hand: love takes doubtful things in the best
sense. Dubia in part meliori sunt interpretanda. See more Weemse. 2. vol. l.
1. Chapter 3. p. 100* Wendelin Theolog. l. 1.6.24. p. 601.


Take but one more perplexed Text, and I have done, Eccl. 7.16. Be not
righteous overmuch, etc. 1. Say some, these are not the words of Solomon, but
of the Atheist, and carnal Politician, who hearing ver. 15. of the righteous
man's perishing in his righteousness, and the wicked man's prolonging his days,
presently the carnal man with his corrupt reason concludes, Be not then
righteous over much. q. d. seeing righteous men fare so ill, Dum furor in cursu
est, cur^enti cede furori, say Politicians.
carry things with indifferency, and be not too precise and too holy, and more
wise then other men; be discreet and wary lest thou bring thy self into danger
and trouble.

Loquitur de justitia illa severa qua saepe proximos judicamus. Scarpius.
2. Say others, here is condemned all rigor in Justic^, whether vindictive,
distributive, or commutative. Magistrates must not be too severe in executing
extreme justice on every slight occasion and sin of infirmity; Est Iustitia
absoluta, sic nemo justus; Iustitia inchoata* sic justus p^rit, justitia
aequivoca* sic ne sis justus nimis. v. con^i^. Dr Halli coram Synod. Dordreit.
p. 41*
but they must use a discreet moderation and equity, not being too severe on
the one hand, nor yet too remiss in sparing or favoring wickedness on the
other hand: So private persons must not stand too much upon their own right,
nor yet suffer their innocence to be too much wronged* but in charity and wise
integrity we should yield sometimes to others, considering our humane frailty.

3. Some conceive that here is condemned curiosity and carelessnesse. q.d. do
not curiously search into those mysteries which are not revealed; lest by thy
pride and curiosity, thou bring Gods judgments on thy self; nor yet be so
wicked and careless as to neglect the truth that is revealed.

4. Say others, Proprie nullus est nimis justus, temperaus, etc. quia quo major
est justitia vel virtus, ^o est perfectior. ^ L^p.
here is condemned, not true righteousness, or true wisdom, (for so we can
never be too righteous, too wise, or too religious and forward; in justice, as
it is justice, we cannot exceed, though in respect of the circumstances, as
the persons to whom, when, and where we do justice, we may exceed or come
short, as Pro. 17.17. to condemn the just is the excess, and to spare the
wicked, is the defect of justice) but Solomon here condemns phari^aicall
righteousness; when men are not content with the righteousness which Gods
word reveals, but out of their pride and selfe-conceitednesse, they will have
a righteousness of their own beyond the word; thus the Pharisces trusted so
much to their own righteousness, traditions and works, that they contemned
Christ. These, these are the men that are over-righteous: such are Papists and
all will-worshippers with their merits, works of supererogation, Quisquis plus
justo non sapit, ille sapit. Ma^^.
etc. Thus the Anabaptists are over-righteous and rigid, they boast of their
perfection; when he that has but half an eye, may plainly see their gross
imperfections; they tell us that the Church must not be a mixed society, they ^
ust all be Saints, real Saints say some, etc. What is this but to be
over-wise; even wise above that which is written? Vanitas ^ic notatu^
hypocritarum osten^antium non suas vir utes, sed virtutum umbras quibus prae
aliis semper apparere student. R gidi s^l^nt esse viriutis satellites and
praecones, neque satis est i^^is si sint re^iquis similes, qui n^scio quia
peculiare semper affectant. ^ayus in locum. See more fully Mr Baxters CC.
Direction 26.
Though I shall condemn none of these opinions, yet the second and the last in
my judgment are most sound, agreeing best with the context and analogy of
faith.

V. Pagnin l. 3. inst^^. cap. 12.
15. The Hebrews often use the Imperative Mood for the Future Tense, to show the
certainty of a thing, as Amos 5.6 Seek the Lord, and live ye (i) ye shall
certainly live. So Deuteronomy. 32.49.50. The Lord bids Moses go up to M^unt Neoo and
dye there (i) thou shall certainly dye there* and on the contrary, they
sometimes put the Future Tense for the Imperative Mood, as Exodus 20. thou
[shalt] not kill, steal etc. for do not kill, steal, etc. So Mal. 2.7 shall
preserve knowledge (i) let them preserve knowledge.

16. Then a thing is said to be done in Scripture phrase, Res tum demum
dicuntur fieri, cum incipia^ manifestari. Reg. Patrum.
when it begins to be done; Thus Jeremy tells the people that after 70 years
captivity in Babylon, they should return from thence, yet many were left in
Babylon after that time; but because the return from thence began that year,
therefore its said to be done then. To crucifixerunt actum inchoatum
significat, non perfectum. ^ Lap. in John. 19.14.
Thus Christ is said to be crucified at the third hour. Mark 15.25. because
the Jews then cried, crucify him, crucify him, and Pilate consented to them,
commanding that he should be scou^ged, and as it were prepared for the Cross,
but at the end of the third hour, the sixth beginning, Pilate juridically
condemned him, and presently they crucified him. Mark then declares the
original and beginning of Christ's Crucifying at the third hour, but Matthew
[27, 46] with the rest, set forth the execution and complement of it at the
sixth hour; or dividing the day into four quarters (3 hours to each quarter)
it was in the third of them, that Christ was Crucified.

In illis quae Metaphorice dicuntur, non oportet accipere similitudinens
secundum omnia. Reg. Schola.
17. In Parables we must always look more to the sense and scope, then to the
letter. Now in a Parable there are three things considerable.

1. Cortex, the words and terms. 2. Radix, the scope it aims at. 3. Fructus,
the fruit which may be gathered from thence.
Theologia symbolica, sive parabolica, non est argumentativa. Aquinas.
Hence we say, that borrowed speeches make no grounded Arguments; they
illustrate, but they prove nothing; they are comparisons, but not foundations.
Thus Mat. 13.24, 25, etc. The Parable of the Tares mixed with the Wheat, does
not argue a toleration of all ^ects, but the scope of it is to show that there
will be a mixture of good and bad in the Church to the end of the world.

Meiosis.
18. In Scripture many times less is spoken then is ^ ea^r as Psalm. 51.17. a
broken heart God will not despise (i) he highly prizeth a broken heart. So 1
These. 5.20. despise not prophesying (i) see that you highly prize the preaching
of the word. Job 5.17. 1 Timothy 4.12. and Tit. 2.15. 1 Samuel 12, 21. which cannot
profit (i) which will greatly hurt you. Ier. 32.35. which I have not commanded
(i) I have seveerly forbidden.
So Heb. 10 38. if any apostatise, Gods soul will take no pleasure in them (i)
he detests and abhors them 1 Cor. 10.5. but with many of them, God was not well
pleased (i) he was highly displeased. Psalm. 22.6. Pro. 24.23. it is not good (i)
it is very evil, Exodus 20.7. not hold him guiltless (i) he will certainly
punish him, Mat. 12.32. never remitted (i) certainly punished.

19. In Scripture there are also many hyperbolicall speeches, by way of
amplification; as, thy seed shall be as the sand of the Sea. Genesis 32.12. 1 Samuel
13.5. Psalm. 78.27. as the stars of Heaven. Heb. 11.12. as the dust of the
earth, Genesis 13.16. Numb. 23.10. a land flowing with milk and honey, Exodus 3.17.
I will make your Heavens Iron, and your earth brass, Levit. 26.19. Swifter
then Eagles, stronger then Lions, 2 Samuel 1.23. Judges 20.16. Rivers of tears
run down mine eyes, Psalm 119.136. not a tear or two, but abundance of tears.
So Psalm. 46.2, 3. and John 21. ult, by these instances 't will be easy to
observe more.

Scriptores sacri in ^itandis. V. T. testimoniis non tam verba sequuntur aut
numerant, quam expendunt sententias, quae si serventur de verborum qualitate ac
numero non laborant. Sanctius. Christ and his Apostles did follow the
Septuagint, which gives the sense and not the words See more fully Weemsee
Jewish Synag. c. 4. p. 61, etc. D. Pride. fascicul. cont. Q. 3 page. 24. 1
Aeternum pro diuturno. Hyperbole. 2. Typice aeternum. So Canaan was a type of
Heaven an eternal inheritance. 3. Catachrest^e aeternum, that which endured a
long time, was said to be eternal, thus circumcision was a covenant for ever
(i) till Christ came, Weemse. 1 Vol. p. 259.
20. Christ and his Apostles citing testimonies out of the Old Testament, do
often follow the Septuagint, rendering the sense but not the words, because the
Scripture lies not in the bare words and syllables, but in the sense and
meaning. Hence sometimes they change something for illustration. Thus Michah
5.1. compared with Mat. 2.6. Micah calls Bethlehem little, in respect of outward
pomp and riches; Matthew calls it famous and great, because Christ should be
born there. Thus Mal. 3.1. with Mat. 11.10. and Hos. 1.6. with Romans 9.25.
sometimes they omit a word, sometimes they add something for explication sake,
as Mat. 2.15, 23. and 26.31. Romans 10.15, 18, 19, 20, 21. 1 Cor. 2.9.

21. These words [for ever, and from Generation to Generation, etc.] do often
signify in Scripture phrase, not eternity, but only that which shall endure a
long time, for some ages and Generations of men, as Genesis 13.15. and 17.8. Exodus
28.29. Levit. 25.46. Deuteronomy. 15, 17. 1 Chro. 15.2. Psalm. 132.14. and so the word
[no more] does not totally deny, but only signifies many times some delaying
of time, as 1 Samuel 7.13. the Philistines came [no more] into the Coast of
Israel: how can this be, when it is apparent they came diverse times after, both
in the days of Samuel, Saul and David? See Mr Leigh Heb. Crit. in verbo
G^olam. p. 374. fol.
the answer is easy, q. d. The Philistines were so shattered and broken by the
immediate hand of God, that they durst [no more] at this time, adventure to set
upon Israel. So Isaiah 23.12. V. plura apud S^lmeron. Prolegomen. 13. formul.
29.
Ezekiel. 26.13, 14. Tire shall sing [no more] nor be built [any more] yet after
some time she was rebuilt and returned to her former mirth and Merchandise.

22. False, unprofitable, useless things, in Scripture-dialect, are accounted
as no things: thus a wicked graceless, unrighteous man, is accounted as no
man, Jeremy 5.1. run to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see if
you can find [a man] why? the streets were full of men, yea, but because they
were not good men, God accounts them as no men. Thus the wicked are said to
have [no heart] Hos 7.11. i. no heart to goodness, and then as good have no
heart at all. Thus the wicked are said [not to hear] the law, because they do
not hear it rightly, obediently. Thus the Priests are said [not to know] the
Lord, Ier. 2.8. they were Priests, and so could not be totally ignorant, but
because their knowledge was merely notionall and speculative, without obedience
and practice, God esteems it as no knowledge.

23. By an Euphemismus or Anti-phrasis, the Scriptures sometimes put a fair
name on a foul vice. Thus, I Kin. 21.13. Naboth is said [to bless God and the
King] (i) to curse them. So Job 1.5. it may be my sons have sinned; and [
Baruch, have blessed God] (i) have ^ursed him. See more Weemse. 1. Vol. l. 2.
c. 3. p. 247, etc.
Thus the vessel wherein Nature does ease it self, is veiled with the
periphrasis, a vessel wherein is no pleasure, Ier. 22.28. Hos. 8.8. So Deuteronomy.
23.15. Judges 3.24. and 14.18. Job 31.10. Psalm. 51. Title. David went in to
Bathshebah. So Romans 1.24, 26, 27.

24. It Is a safe way, where a Text admits of many (but not contrary) senses to
take in all, lest we miss the meaning: where no reason does constrain, we are
not to restrain the words, but may take them in the largest sense, if there be
nothing to hinder us, neither matter, phrase, context, or scope; nothing
contrary to other Scriptures, nor the analogy of faith; then may you take all;
for in a Scripture which may without impeachment of any truth, admit diverse
senses, I may not be so positive in one, as to reject all others. e. g. Pro.
23.23. buy the truth, what truth? why truth in judgment, truth in affection,
truth in doctrine, truth in discipline, truth in words, and truth in works: all
these must we labor for, but the two first being most genuine, and the
foundation of all the rest, are principally to be sought after. So Ephesians. 5.16.
Redeem the time, why but the word is (...), opportunitas temporis; yet because
the word is taken promiscuously in the New Testament, we may make use of both,
and say, redeem time, and especially the seasons of time. Thus in that much
tortured Text, 1 Cor. 12.7. There was given me a thorn in the flesh, the
messenger of Satan to buffet me. Interpreters vary here very much: so many men,
so many opinions, so that as one says in a like case, Nescio an hic locus
^acilior suisset si nemo cum exposuisset. Maldonat. Caro hic meo judicio non
corpus, sed partem animae nondum regeneratam significat; q. d. mihi da^us est
stimulus* quo caro mea pungeretur: neque enim adhuc sum ad o spiritualis cum
obnxious sim tentationibus s^cundum carnem. Calvin in locum.
I think this Text had been clearer, if some had never meddled with it,
especially the Ancients are much mistaken about this thorn in the flesh, etc.
1. Some of them think it to be some bodily sickness, some say 'twas a
perpetual headache, others, the gout, or a pain in the small guts, or
weakness of stomach, or fleshly lusts, or at least some disease laid on him by
the Devil: these are most of them ridiculous. -- Would the magnanimous Apostle
(think we) that had gone thorough so many difficulties and dangers, have
begged so often and earnestly to be delivered from a poor disease? nor is it
probable that so mortified, so laborious, so temperate a man, should be
troubled with lust, or if it had been so, no doubt but he would have used that
remedy, which he prescribed to others in that case, 1 Cor. 7 9. besides, the
remedy being spiritual, v 9. it is not probable that the malady was corporal:
others think this thorn to be some cruel persecutor, such as Alexander the
Copper-Smith, of whom he often complains, 2 Timothy 4.14. he by his persecution and
reproaches, seemed to be the Devils agent to buffet him, but this sense is still
too narrow, for these were but external thorns, of which the Apostle used to
glory, and not complain.

3. Others more genuinely take it metaphorically, for internal temptations,
which are fitly called Hoc in meditato habeant qui praestant eximiis
virtutibus: si qua habeant admissa vitia, si quibus odiis impetantur, si quibus
sugill^entur maledictis, non tantum ^erulas ess^cael^stis m^gistri, s^d
colaphos, qui verecundtam incutiant, and retund^^ omne su^erb^^ and seraciam.
Calv. in locum.
buffetings, because they come so thick upon a man, that he can hardly take
breath; the Devil dogs good hearts with foulest lusts, sometimes with Atheism,
Idolatry, blasphemy, etc. in all or any of which, if the soul be merely
passive, (as the word buffeting here implies) they are Satan's sins, and our
crosses only; and therefore the most pious and judicious, do conceive this
thorn in the flesh, and By the messsenger of Satan, some conceive i^ meant,
some sin whereunto Paul was tempted, as a means to keep him humble, for nothing
is matter of so great humiliation to a gracious hear^, as the feeling of the
power and strength of sin within it.
messenger of Satan, to be some inward corruption edged with a temptation,
which Satan stirred up in his heart to vex him; or original corruption set on
by the Devil; others conceive it to be a wound in the spirit, the sting of
conscience pressing him down to the lowest hell, (in his own sense) who before
was taken up to the highest heavens; and this seems best to agree with the
scope of the place, for ver. 7. he tells us, that he had abundance of
Revelations ias at his first conversion, Acts 9.5. 2. When he was called to
Macedonia, Acts 16.9. 3. When he went to Corinth, Acts 18.9. 4. When he was
sent to the Gentiles. Acts 22.17. 5. When he was in danger of shipwreck, Acts
27.23. and here when he was caught up into the third Heaven, (...), est aculeus
corpor^ ^nhaer^ns, vel spin^ pedem pungens. Ego sub hoc vocabulo comp^^hendi
arbitror omne genus tenta^^o^nis quo Paul^, exer^^batur. Calvin*
v. 2.] Now lest the Apostle should be exalted above measure [he doubles that
saying] God in his wisdom lets Satan loose upon him, to humble him, to buffet
and vex him, and keep him low: now because this somewhat hindered him for a
while in the cheerful discharge of his calling; it is fitly compared to a
thorn in the foot, with which a man cannot go but lamely, and with very great
pain, etc. Briefly, the Paraphrase may be this, q. d. God has vouchsafed me
many glorious Revelations, with the number of which lest I should be exalted,
and too much puffed up (as our frail nature is easily transported) there was
through the holy permission, and wise ordination of God, Attendant omnes pii
quantum sit superb^ae venenum, quod non po^^^^ nisi veneno cura^i. Aug.
way given to some strong and violent corruption, edged with a temptation from
Satan, to humble and afflict me, lest I should be exalted above measure;
whereupon I often and earnestly besought God, that he would be pleased to rebuke
the ^empter, and to free me from those violent injections, which Satan darted
in upon me, and from those troublesome suggestions of the fiend: But he said
unto me, content thy self to wrestle a while with this temptation, knowing
that it is sufficient that I do by my power defend thee, and by my grace uphold
thee from the prevailing power thereof; besides, the glory of my power will be
the more seen in thy weakness, Conside^emus diligenter quis hic loquatur,
vicerat tot p^ricula, tormenta and alia mala; triumphum de omnibus Christi
hostibus egerat, expulerat mortis timorem, mundum renuntiaverat, necdum tamen
subegerat penitus su^erbiam; imo ad^o anceps illi certamen restabat, ut vincere
non posset nisi colaphis caesus Calv* in locum.
etc. Now when Paul saw that God gained glory, and himself humility by it, he
was contented to bear it, yea he resolves to glory in it, since he saw it was
a medicine to cure him of pride, and not a poison to destroy him: So that here
as in a glass, we may see why the Lord suffers his choicest servants to be vexed
by Satan, and afflicted with variety of temptations. viz. to hide pride from
their eyes, and to keep their graces in exercise; I shall shut up all with that
excellent counsel of Musculus on the place. Cogitandum est hic prohomini, quam
proclive sit carni ut propter qualemcunque praerogativam infletur ac superbiat:
etenim si hoc erat Apostolo tot laboribus ac periculis depresso usque adeo
timendum, ut singulari quadam antidoto opus haberet, per quod contra
tentationem superbiae in humilitate ac modestia contineretur; quid nobis non
est multo timendum amplius qui et si parem revelationum excellentiam consequuti
ron sumus* multo tamen minus habenius roboris ad resistendum tentationibus
superbiae, quantumcunque levibus ac minutis, quam habuerit ille contra tam
graves superbiendi occasiones. Quare admo^um desipiunt qui studio dignitates ac
honores in hoc saeculo ambiunt, non considerantes quantis seipsi periculis
obnoxios reddant.

Now in this variety of opinions, I shall leave the judicious Reader to his
choice. Ego enim facile patior unumquemque abundare suo sensu. Luther.

25. Some numbers in Scripture have a kind of eminency and excellency in them;
especially these three: Three, Six and Seven. Numerus Ternarius symbolum est
multitudinis and universitatis tria enim sum o^nia. scilicet, p^^ma. Aris.
Hence the Scripture when they would enlarge or multiply the sense, they use
one of these numbers. Thus Ier. 7.4. They cry the Temple of the Lord, the
Temple, the Temple (i) they did often repeat that word. So Ier. 22.29. O earth,
earth, earth, hear the word of the Lord; that threefold repetition makes the
speech more emphaticall and vigorous. So Ezekiel. 21.27. I will overturne,
overturne, overturne it, (i) I will mightily and surely overturn it. So when
the Angel would show the greatness of Gods plagues, he cries, woe, woe, woe,
Rev. 8.13. Thus Eccl. 4.12. a threefold cord (i) a cord of many folds. So the
most holy God, is proclaimed the thrice Holy God, Isaiah 6.3. Thus even Heathen
Authors have used the word, -- O terque quanterque beati. Virg.
and when we would express the greatness of a man's happiness or honor, we
style him thrice happy, thrice honorable, etc. Thus the number three implies
compleatnesse and excellency, as Exodus 23 14, 17. and 25.32. and 27.1. Deuteronomy.
17.6. and 19.7, 9. 2. The number six, notes perfection, as may be seen in the
work of Creation, the Lord could as easily have made the world in a moment, as
in six days; but the Lord saw it good to take a complete number of days, for
so complete a work, Genesis 1. u^t. Thus when the Lord would bring a full and
complete judgment on wicked Gog, Agit de pleno Gog inter^^u and excidio. a Lap
Numerus sep tenarius significat in scripturis. 1. Multitudinem. 2.
Perfectionem. Percu^am vos plena, perfecta and multiplici plaga. a Lap.
Ezekiel. 39.2. sextabo te. I will smite thee with six plagues (as in the Margin
of our Bibles) (i) I will punish thee full sorely. 3. Seven is a famous number,
implying, 1. multitude. 2* perfection, Levit. 26.18, 21, 24, 28. I will plague
you yet seven times more (i) many times more, or more extrea^ely. Deuteronomy. 28.7.
they shall flee before thee seven ways (i) many ways, a certain number for an
uncertain Genesis 4.15. vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold (i) he shall
have manifold punishment. V. Se^^enarii numeri vim apud Anl. Gell. l. 3* c. 10.
Ruth 4.15. better to thee then seven sons (i) then many sons. So Psalm. 12.6.
and 119.164. Pro. 24.16. and 26.25. falls seven times (i) he falls often into
trouble, yet rises again. 1 Samuel 2 5. the barren has borne seven* (i) many,
she is a complete mother, and has a flourishing family. So Micah 5.5. Zech.
3.9. Mat. 12.45. seven unclean spirits (i) a multitude of Devils, etc.

26. Ordinary examples of the Saints approved in Scripture, being against no
general precept, have the force of a general rule, and are to be followed,
yet in following examples we must observe. 1. How they did a thing. 2. When
they did it. 3. Where they did it. 4. Why they did it, as the learned Weemse
has well observed, Weemse Jewish synag l 2 chapter 5. p. 265.
to whom I shall refer you for full satisfaction in this point. See more, Rule
50.

27. The order of time is not always kept in Scripture, but sometimes that is
placed first which was done last; In scriptura non est prius and posterius.
the Saints looked more at the s^^stance, then at small circumstances in their
writings; and therefore the placing of things must not be strictly urged in
Scripture; for it is usual by a prolepsis or anticipation of time to relate
that first which is last, as John 11.2. it is said Mary anointed the Lord, To
unxit accipitur non de unctione praeterita, sed futura, per anticipationem. a
Lap.
yet it is mentioned in the next Chapter per (...), and est una de regulis ad
intellig^ndam scripturam sanctam necessariis. Luth. loci com. p 75.

28. Arguments drawn from silent authority, Argumentum ab authoritate ^eg^nte,
sed non ab authoritate negativa, v^let in Theologicis.
in matters of fact, conclude nothing. e. g. there is no mention made of Adams
repentance of his sacrificing or performing any pious exercise whilst he lived
on earth* yet it does not follow therefore, he did none of these things. We
read of no parents Melchisedech had, yet we cannot therefore conclude that he
had none: if all should be written, the world it self could not contain the
books, John 21. ult. and therefore it will not follow, There are five kinds of
questions in Scripture. 1. Q. Dubitans, a doubting question, as Psalm 77.7, 8.
2. Q. Docens, ^ teachi^g Q. Is. 60.8. it teaches us the multitude of those
that shall ^l^ck after the means of grace 3. Qu Disc^ns, Ma^k 10 16. he desi^es
to learn the way to Heaven. So Acts 2.37. 4. Q. A^^irmans, 2 Kin. 12 19. and
14.18. Ier. 23.29. 5. Q. Negans, as Psa. 19.12. who can understand his errors
(i) no man can understand the full depth of them. Abbot.
because the Scripture does not mention such a thing, therefore it was not done.

29. He that will understand the Proverbs, must mark their opposition, if
Parables, their scope, if other places, their dependence.

30. Interrogations (often times) are emphaticall and strong affirmations or
negations, as Genesis 4.7. if thou do well, shall thou not be accepted? this
interrogative is in sense a vehement assertive or affirmative. q. d. thou shall
surely be accepted both thou and thy sacrifice, if thou do well. Thus Genesis
13.9. and 37.13. Joshua 1.9, 10, 13. have not I commanded the? (i) I have
without all question assuredly commanded thee, for this interrogation with the
Hebrews, is a strong affirmation. So Genesis 37.13. 2 Samuel 13.28. 2 Kings 6.32.
John 4.35. Mark 12.24. and Ier. 23.23, 24. 2. Sometimes they are strong
denials, as Genesis 18.14. is any thing too hard for God? Mat. 12.26. Rom 3.3. and
10.14, 15.3. Sometimes questions do diminish and abate the sense, Zech. 4.7.
Who art thou O great mountain? thou look very big and great, See more fully
^ Hyric. Cla. de Tropis. p. 211.
but who art thou? I will tell thee O proud oppress^r, and opposer of my
people, though in thy own conceit thou art a Mountain invisible, unmovable,
yet in my peoples eyes thou art but a molehill, and shall shortly be made a
nothing, even as a plain before them. Thus when David would abate himself, he
cries, who am I? what is my house? 2 Samuel 7.18. 4. Sometimes they intend,
raise, and heighten the sense, by way of admiration, Ps. 8.10. Exodus 15.11. Who
is a God like unto thee? let all the world if they can, show such a God as thou
art. So M^. 7.18. the question puts the brightest glory upon God, in pardoning
sin; there is no sin-pardoning God, but our God only. 5. Sometimes they are
expostulatory, and complain, Ps. 22.1. Why have thou forsaken me? Ier. 12.1.
Wherefore does the way of the wicked prosper? Epitasis sive auxesis est non
vulgaris cum affirmatur aliquid, and contrarii ipsius adjungitur negatio. Sanct.
Is. 1.21.

31. When the Scripture would strongly affirm, it does it often times by denying
the contrary. So Isaiah 38.1. thou shall dye, and not live, Ezekiel. 18. 21. (i)
thou shall certainly die. Deuteronomy. 28.13. he shall make thee the head, and not the
tail. John 1.20. he confessed and denied not. Isaiah 39.4. Ier. 42.4. (i) Deus
est lux purissima.
1 John 1.5. it is very familiar with the Hebrews, by affirming and denying to
express the same thing for stronger confirmation of it. Negatio contrarii
auget vim affirma^ionis. Deuteronomy. 33.6. Pro. 30.11. 1 Samuel 1.11. John. 20.27.

32. The Scripture speaks many things negatively, which are to be understood
only comparatively, as Hos. 6.6. Mat. 9.13. I will have mercy, and not
sacrifice. (i) comparatively, I desire mercy [rather] than sacrifice. So So
John 6.4^. and Heb. 8 11. 1 Cor. 3.^. and 15 10. So Genesis 32.28. (i) he shall
rather be called Israel, then Jacob. Pr. 8 10 (i) buy wisdom rather then
gold. Luke 14.12, 13. (i) rather the ^o^r then the rich* Ephesians. 6.12. Luke 9.56.
Ioh. 3.17.
Ier. 31.34. they shall no more teach every man his neighbor. The words must
not be taken simply, and negative, for a pure negation (as some Libertines
would construe them) but comparatively, (i) there shall be far greater
knowledge and clearer light under the new Testament, then was under the Old,
Isa. 11.9. not that there shall be no teaching at all, (for Christ has given
some to be Pastors and Teachers, Ephesians. 4.11, 12.) but in Gospel times they
shall not only be taught by men, but they shall be taught inwardly and
experimentally by God himself, q. d. they shall not every man teach his
neighbor, so obscu^ely by Ceremonies, Types and Figures.
Isa. 54.13. his spirit shall lead them not only unto, but into truth, Ioh.
16.13. So 1 Cor. 1.17. not to baptize. (i) comparatively, Christ sent me
rather to preach then to baptize, 1 John 3.18. love not in word [onely] but
[rather] indeed and in truth, So Psalm. 51.16.17. the words must not be taken
(...) and absolute, sed comparate. q.d. it is not so much the outward, as the
Inward sacrifice which God requires. In co^parationibus saepe negatur illud
quod no^ est excludendum, sed tantum alteri postponendum. Dav.
Mark 9.37. he receives not me, but him that sent me (i) he [rather] receives
the father sending, then me sent, because he receives me for his sake, Col.
3.23. do it as to the Lord, and not ^o men (i) rather to the Lord then to men,
because ye serve them for the Lord Christ's sake.

33. When the Hebrews would express any excellent, great, or glorious thing,
they often join the name of God with it, it is a frequent Hebraisme: Thus Abraham
is called a Prince of God, Genesis 23.6 (i) a mighty Prince, the mountains of God
(i) high and excellent mountains, (...), and est epitheton omnis rei
admirandae and magnae. Wemsee. (...).
Exodus 3.1. and 4.27. Psalm. 46.4. the City of God (i) a glorious City. Psalm.
36.6. So Cedars of God (i) tall Cedars, Psalm. 80.11. a river of God, Psalm.
65.10. wrastlings of God, Genesis 30.5. Harps of God, Rev. 15.2. (i) excellent
Harps. Res Dei Hebraeis dicuntur eximiae, Deo Opt. Max. dignae. Paraeus. Thus
great hail is called Gods hail, El-gabbish. So a strong Lion is called the
Lion of God, ariel. 2 Samuel 23.20. Moses is said to be fair to God (i)
exceeding fair, Acts 7.20. So Nineveh was great to God (i) very great, Jonah
3.3.

Si videtur flagitium jubere, aut beneficentiam vitare, ^igurata est locutio.
Aug.

When the literal sense is against modesty, piety, or good manners, it must be
left. Weemse 1 Vol. l. 2. c. 1. p. 232. Aug. de Doct. Christ. l. 3. c. 16.


34. When the literal sense is against any commandment of the Law, then the
words must not be taken properly; else the Grammatical and most immediate
sense, is ever soundest, unless some apparent error in doctrine, or mischief
in manners follow: for when a sense crosses any truth taught in other Texts of
Scripture, it is always a false sense; but if it agree with the Original, the
scope of the place, and the analogy of faith, it is good. Austins counsel is
good, there are four things (says he) to be observed in ex^ounding Scripture.

1. Phrasis Sc^ip^urae. 2. Circumst^^^iae. 3. Collat^^ ^^orum locorum. 4.
Analogia ^^dei.
35. Words of fact, are often put for words of speech, as Exodus 13.2. Sanctify
the first born (i) command them to be sanctified. Ier. 1.10. I have sent thee
to destroy, etc. (i) to preach, and thereby to declare, that I the Lord will
do it. John 4.1. Christ is said to baptize (i) he commanded his Disciples to
do it.

36. It Is usual in Scripture, to put the abstract for the concret, to set
forth the excellency of a thing. Erit B^racha benedictio (i) ita plene per
omnia benedictus, ut videatur esse ipsa benedictio* a Lap.
Thus God tells Abraham that he shall not only be blessed, sed erit ipsissima
benedictio, Genesis 12.2. (i) affluens omni benedictione, and non tam benedictus,
quam ipsa benedictio dicitur. So the Sanctum Sanctorum, dicitur ab Heb^aeis
sanctitas sanctitaetum (i) eximie sanctum. So Christ is called, 1 Cor. 1.30.
not righteous, but Righteousness, Romans 1.25. veritas pro vero cultu, mendacium
pro falso. Talis Hebraismus plerumque est significantior, ut scelus pro
scelesto, ste^ quui ^inium pro curpi.
Sanctification, etc. (i) summus and saptentissimus justificator and
sanctificator noster. So 1 Cor. 15.50. and circumcision for the persons
circumcised. Romans 4.9. Phil. 3.3. So abomination often put for abominable, Pro.
3.32. and 11.1. and 15 8.9.

37 The conjunctive particle [And] does not always di^tinguish ^ivers things,
but is often used by way of explanation, Conjunctio [and] non semper diversa
distinguit, sed expositivae particulae saepe vicem gerit perfiguram quam vocant
Hendiadis. And is often taken comparatively, for much more as Psalm. 125.2. And
the Lord is about his people. q. d. as the Mountains are about Jerusalem [ ^o
for^ifie and d^f^nd it] so much more is the Lord about his people [to fortify
and defend them] So Amos 1.3. for three transgressions, And, (i) much more for
a fourth I will punish, etc. Sola express dicta in probando fundamentali
dogmate admittunt Sociniani: Hos refellit doctis. Horn beck contra Socinian.
l. 1. c. 9. p. 211, 212. etc.
as Mat. 3.11. he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire (i) with
the Holy Ghost, which shall be like fire to purge out your dross. John 3.5.
except a man be born again of water and the spirit (i) with spiritual water,
or the spirit which is like water to cleanse, cool, and refresh us. Spiritum
and aquam pro eodem posuit, frequens loquendi mos est in Scriptura, cum de
spiritu fit mentio, ad exprimendam ejus vim, aquae vel ignis nomen adjungi.
Calvin.

38. Where one and the same word is used in diverse senses, in diverse places of
Scripture, the circumstances of the Text, must judge and declare in what sense
it is to be taken there.

39. Whatsoever is truly and soundly collected from Scripture (by good
consequence) is Scripture, as though it were expressly written. e. g. the word
Trinity, Sacrament, Thou shall baptize Infants, are not literally and
syllabically in Scripture, yet since by good consequence they may be gathered
from thence, it is equivalent as if in so many letters they were written there,
Mat. 22.32, 33. else disputations, Sermons, and books consonant to Scripture
should not be credited. See this more fully cleared in my Font-Guarded. p 34,
35. and Mr Sidenham against Anabapt. p. 6, 7, etc.

40. Contemn not the judgment of those learned, Godly, Orthodox lights which
God has raised up in this latter age of the world, whose names are precious in
the Church of God, for their Piety and Fidelity in his work; as Calvin, Beza,
Bucer, Bullinger, Peter Martyr, Wolphius, Marlorate, Musculus, Zanchy, Perkins,
Paraeus, Piscator, Rivet, etc. many green heads (out of pride and
selfe-conceitednesse) contemn these famous lights, and trust to their own wit,
and so run themselves on many rocks: it is good for young men, especially at
their first setting forth, to make use of the labors of godly and Orthodox
Divines; not that I would have any to pin their faith on any man's sleeve, be he
never so godly, or learned; only I would not have men rashly, without good
ground and strong reason, to dissent from the common judgment, and received
opinion of those whom the Church of God has found faithful in expounding
Scripture.

Amen est vox non jurantis, sed affirm m^s and graviter asseverantis and
^apissime opta^ is. Adverbio^um geminatio vel emphasin, vel dist^ibutionem
notat, ut Lev 6.12. mane, mane, (i) quolibet man tutino tempore; ita Eze. 13.10.
41. When the Scripture affirms a thing earnestly, as being a matter of great
concernment, it uses to double the asseveration, as John 1.51. and 3.3, etc.
no Evangelist but John, uses this double affirmation, and he uses it nineteen
times in his Gospel, this he did the rather to strengthen our belief, and to
show how sparing he was of an oath; and for the greater certainety of the
thing. As Pharaoh's dream was doubled, to show the certainty of it, Gen 41.32.
In Scripture there is a threefold Amen. 1. Assenting, Deuteronomy. 27.26. and 1 Cor.
14.16. 2. Assuring, Mat. 5.18. 3. Assevering, so here, Amen, when prefixed, is
a certain and earnest asseveration, when affixed at the end of our Prayers,
etc. it notes our assent and assurance. q. d. Quae ego dic^ sunt Amen Amen (i)
vera vera, hoc est, verissima certissima, and omni alia veritate veriora, omni
alia certitudine certiora. a Lap. in John 3.3.

Suppositio nihil ponit in esse.
42. Suppositions in Scripture, are no Positions, when the speech is only
Hypotheticall, it concludes nothing; for a conditional proposition does not
simply affirm, and therefore conclusions gathered from it, as if it were
affirmative, will not hold, e. g. Ezekiel. 18.24. If a righteous man turn from
his righteousness. Hence the Arminians conclude, that a righteous man may fall
from grace: but 1. This is but a supposition, and so concludes not. 2. The Text
does not speak of Evangelicall righteousness, but of a legal, civil, moral
righteousness, which may be lost. So Ezekiel. 14.14 [i^] Noah, Job and Daniel
should pray for them, etc. it does not therefore follow, that the Saints
departed, do pray for living Saints. Mat. 11.21, 22. [if] ^he mighty works
which were wrought in thee, had been done in Tire and Sidon, they had repented,
etc. it does not therefore follow, that there was some inclination in Tire and
Sidon to repentance, as Luke 19.37. if these should hold their peace, the
stones would speak; it will not follow that therefore there was some
inclination in the stones to speak.

43. When the Scripture doubles any thing. 1. In denouncing judgments, it
notes the certainty, V. Greenhill on Ezekiel. 5.8. See more fully Illyric. de
Tropis. p. 28 4.
celerity, and frequency of them, as Genesis 2.17. dying thou shall dye (i) thou
shall surely dye. So Multiplicando multiplicabo (i) valde multiplicabo dolorem
tuum.
Genesis 3.16. 2. In promising mercies, it notes reality and earnestness. Isaiah
40.1. Ezekiel. 37.5, 6. Isaiah 55.1. come, come, come. Hab. 2.3. Hos. 2.19. thrice
I will betroth thee: the iteration implies affection, intention, and reality.
3. In prophesies it notes the speediness and certainty of them, Genesis 41.32.
Exodus 3.7. Heb. 10.37. 4. In Prayer it notes the servency, and earnest desire
of him that prays. (...). precibus precatus est (i) ferventer precatus est.
James 5.17. he prayed in prayer (i) he prayed earnestly: many pray, but they
do not pray in prayer, Mat. 7.21. 5. In Narrations and Repetitions, they serve
either for confirmation to assure us that the matter is true, and worthy to be
noted, or else for explication, the latter clause exegetically expounding the
former, as Deuteronomy. 11.22. usually it is emphatically, as Ier. 18.18. come let us
devise devises (i) let us be earnest and active to plot Ieremie's ruin. So
John 9.4. I must work the works of him that sent me; there is an emphasis in
the expression, and it notes Christ's strong intention on the work of God. So
Isa. 6.3. Ier. 22 29.
Ita conduplicat Paulus quaedam ad majorem emphasin, maxim in gradibus
comparationis, idque ut plurimum excessum significet, ut ad Phil. 1.23 multo
magis melius (i) long melius; Geminatio Idiomate H^b^aico nomina aliquando
distribu^^. Sanctius in Ezekiel. 14 4: vir. vir. He^. (i) quicunque vir.
a Lap. So Eccl. 1.2. 6. Sometimes it signifies distribution. 1 Chro. 16. a
gate and a gate (i) every gate, and 2 Chro. 19 5. Levit. 17.3. a City and a
City (i) every City. Ezekiel. 14.4. man, man (i) every man. Levit. 18.6. Psalm.
122.4. 7. It notes variety or diversity, as Pro. 20.20. a weight and a weight
(i) diverse waights, an heart and an heart (i) a diverse and a double heart. 8.
It notes excellency, as Cant. 1.1. song of songs, God of Gods. Psalm. 116.2.
King of Kings (i) most high and excellent. 9. An adverbe double, does increase
the denial, as Mat. 5.20* (...), ye shall not, not (i) in no wise enter. So
Rev. 21.27. and Heb. 13.5. there are five negatives, I will not, no I will not,
I will not leave thee nor forsake thee.

44. Of Scripture Weights and Measures.
Of the Line. 2. Reed. 3. Palm, etc. See Godwins Jewish Antiq. l. 6. c. 9.
FIrst, there was the common Cubit, from the point of the Elbow to the top of
the middle Finger. 2. There was the Cubit of the Sanctuary, which was more then
the common Cubit. Deuteronomy 3.11. the Cubit of a man was ordinarily a foot and a
half, or half a yard; this was the common Cubit; but the holy Cubit, or the
Cubit of the Sanctuary was a full yard containing two of the common Cubits: by
this Moses measured the Tabernacle, and Solomon the Temple. 3. There was a
Geometrical Cubit, which contained six common Cubits, and according to these
(its thought) that Noah's Arc was built, Genesis 6.15, 16.

2. The Hebrews had measures of capacity, and those were of two sorts.

1. Some were for dry things, as corn, seed etc.

2. Some for liquid things, as Wine, Oil, etc.

1. The measures of dry things, were 5 especially.

1. A Kab. 2. An Omer. 3. Modius, a measure. 4. The Ephah. 5. The Homer.
2. The measures of liquid or moist things, were three especially.

1. The Log. 2. The Hin. 3. The Bath.
1. The Kab was the first and the least measure, In aridis fuit, quod Cad erat
in liquidis.
which the Hebrews had, they used it in the measuring of dry things; 'twas the
eighteenth part of an Ephah (say some) the sixth part of a Satum, it contained
the quantity of 24 egg shells; it was equal to our Quart. The famine in Samaria
was so great, that a fourth part of a Kab of Doves dung, was sold for five
pieces of silver, 2 Kings 6.25. an Asses head (though it could have but little
meat on it, Cum Hannibal Casilinum obsideret, Mus unus vend^batur ducentis
denariis. Val. Max. l. 7. c. 6.
yet in that extremity) was sold for ten pounds, (say some) and the fourth part
of a Kab of Doves dung, which is conceived to be about a pound and one ounce
(i) 13 Reckoning 12 ounces to the pound, and not 16, as we usually do.
ounces, was sold at 12. s. 6. d. This was Gods just judgment on them for
their Idolatry and sin, that they who set at naught the word of God, that
heavenly Manna, and most precious food of the soul, should now be enforced
thorough necessity to pay most dea^e for base things, and at other times
contemptible, and all to satisfy their hunger.

2. An Omer was the tenth part of an Ephah, Exo. 16.36. some call it Gomer,
because Y is pronounced by H or G. it contained about three pints and an half.
3. Modius a measure, or satum was a Gallon and half, we translate the word in
general, a measure, 2 Ki^g^ 7.1. to morrow a measure (i) a Satum of fine
flower shall be sold for a shekell.

4. The Ephah was the tenth part of an Homer, equal with the [Bath] in liquid
things: about an English bushel, it contained three Pecks and ten Gomers,
Levit. 19.36. 1 Samuel 1.24. and 17.17. Isaiah 5.10. Amos 8.5.

5. The Homer as the Talent, was the greatest weight; so the Homer was the
greatest measure, it contained (say some) as much as a Camel could well bear
at once: about ten bushels (say others) about five bushels others say. Ezekiel.
45.11. it contained ten Ephahs (i) 45 Gallons, or 5 Bushels and 5 Gallons.

2. The measures of liquid things were, 1. The Log, it was the least measure of
liquids, 'twas the twelfth part of an Hin, containing in quantity six egg
shells, about half a pint, Levit. 14.10, 12, 15, 21, 24.

2. The Hin contained about three Quarts, Exo. 29.40. and 30.24. Numb. 5.4, 5.
Ezekiel. 4.11.

3. The Bath, the tenth part of an Homer, equal with the Ephah, the same which
in Greek is called Hydria, in Latin Cadus; it contained four Gallons and an
half, Ezekiel. 45.10, 11, 14. Isaiah 4.10.

45. Concerning the Coins that were among the Hebrews, as the Mite, the
Quadrans, the Gerah, Didrachmum, Stater, Denarius, a Shekell, a Talent, etc.
Interpreters vary much about them: those that have done best both on Weights
and Coins, are a Lapide in the end of the Pentateuch. Weemse, 1 Vol. in the
end p. 129, See more, Wilkins Ecclesiast. p. 42. ult. Edit.
etc. Godwin Jewish Antiq l. 6. c. 10. Breerwoods little Tract, de Ponder. and
pretiis vet. nummorum cum rec^ntioribus collatione; and above all, our last
large and learned Annotations on the whole Bible, are so.

46. The Imperative Mood commanding, is often put for the Optative, wishing, as
Cant. 1.2. Let him kiss me, for, oh that he would kiss me. So Mat. 6.9, 10.
let thy name be hallowed, let thy Kingdom come. q. d. oh that thy name might
be hallowed, and thy Kingdom come.

Mos est Scripturae, ut optare videatur malum, cum non optet, sed praevideat.
Aug.
47. Many imprecations are not so much Prayers, as Prophesies; foretelling what
shall be, rather then desiring they should be.

48. There is a singular variety, but no contrariety in the Scriptures; there
is a sweet Harmony and consent in them, the Old Testament agreeing with the
New, Quae pugnare videntur nostra culpa ac ignorantia talia esse existimantur,
q^res non intelligimus, velcircumstantias non expendimus: Illyricus.
Moses with the Prophets, and the Apostles with them both, if any place seem to
contradict another, the fault lies in our own blindness, and not in the
Scripture, which is always at peace with it self. e. g. Christ is called
David's Lord, Psa. 110.1. and elsewhere he is called David's son, Mat. 22.42,
43, 44, 45. The answer is easy, Christ was David's Lord in respect of his
Divinity, and David's son, in respect of his humanity. So, as he was God, the
Father and he were one; but as he was man, so the Father was greater then he.
Christus qui per se and proprie est pacis author; per accidens, ^rop^er hominum
malitiam turbarum est occasio. Call. Non veni mittere pacem (i) terrenam and
mundanam; non pacem spiritua^em mentis, and pacem unionis fidelium inter se, ac
cum Deo and Angelis eju^ Christum allaturum praedixit Isaias 9.6, 7. and 65.25.
(...) 14. a L^p.
Thus Christ and the Gospel simply considered in themselves, bring inward
peace. John. 14.27. my peace I give you; but accidentally meeting with the
corruptions of men and the malice of Satan. So Mat. 10.34. I came not to send
[outward, worldly] peace, but a sword. Satan and his Agents being enraged at
the publication of the Gospel, will raise up stirs and oppositions against
it. Thus Mat. 10 10. a staff is forbidden the Apostles, yet Mark 6.8, 9. a
staff is allowed them. Ans. We must distinguish of staves 1. There are
striking defensive staves, which cumber those that carry them, and are a
burden to them, these are forbidden. 2. There are itinerary staves, Whereon.
Travelers do ease themselves, Genesis 32.10. these walking staves Mark means.
Duplex tum fuit in usu baculus. s^^l. defensiorius and portatorius, itinerarius
seu sustentatorius: See most seeming contradictions reconciled very
satisfactorily, in Sharpius his Symphony.
loquun^ur Evangelistae de defensorio and portatorio qui oneri fuit
portantibus: Christus vero apud Marcum, itinerarium and sustentatorium baculum
adjumenti loco permittit. Sharpius.

49. Whatsoever is said in Scripture, for the comfort of one, must be applied
by all in the like case and condition. Deus erga similes similiter se gerit.
That promise which God ^ade to Joshua [ Joshua 1.5] is by the Apostle applied
to all the fai^^full, Quod convenit tali, qua^ talis, connveit omni tali.
Heb. 13.5. that promise which belongs to one believer, as a believer, belongs
to every believer; what he promises to one he promises to all that a^e in
that state: for though some may have mo^e grace, yet none have more (...). Look
what promise God made to Abraham, David, Paul, etc. as believers* we (...) and
must apply them as ours* for all the promises are our heritage* and belong to
us, as well as our forefathers; to us Gentiles, as well as to the Jews. Acts
2.39. the promise is to you and to your children, and to such as are afar
off. Romans 4.16. Ephesians. 3.6.

50. Examples may be followed where there are the like causes. circumstances
and conditions; V^i similes causae and circumstantiae, ibi locum habet exemplum.
when the equity of the thing is universal and the cause common; else
extraordinary cases will not make an ordinary Rule. e. g. Ehud killed Eglon [
Judge. 3.20, 21.] therefore a Friar may kill a King. Ans. Non sequitur, Fecit
hoc Ehud Dei instinctu, eoque hostem potius interemit, quam populi rectorem
tyrantium. a Lap:
for Ehud had a special commission from God, to do what he did, he raised him
up to be a deliverer of his people, ver. 15. and therefore this can be no
president to any, to murder Princes, though they be Heretics and Tyrants.
Samson (singulari inflinctu) direct intendebat Philistaeos occidere, indirecte
seipsum* Ames.
So Samsons killing himself, is no ground for selfe-murther [ Judge. 16.30.]
for what he did, was done by an extraordinary motion, and instinct of Gods
spirit, nor did he directly and primarily intend his own destruction, but the
ruin of Gods enemies. Elijah by extraordinary calling, called for fire from
Heaven, and burnt the Captains, therefore the Disciples may call for fire from
Heaven to burn the Samaritans [ Luke 9.55.] this will not follow, because they
acted not by the same spirit; Elijah was led by a spirit of zeal, but these by
a fiery, furious, rash spirit. Thus the act of Phinehas was extraordinary,
Numb. 25.8, 11. Nor will it follow, because the Apostles anointed the sick with
oil, and cured them [ Iam. 5 14.] therefore we may do so to; for that gift
was miraculous and peculiar to those Apostolical times, and is now ceased;
besides, that oil was ad sanationem, for health and recovery; but the Papists
is ad viaticum, for a journey, when men are dying and past recovery. Thus
because in the Apostolical times, there was an extraordinary gift of
Prophesying and interpreting Scripture by Revelation without any study, it does
not follow that therefore the same gift abides still, and All may Prophecy.

E^ si [donec] aliquando terminum significat, tamen ple^umque infinitum tempus
significat. Paraeus.
51. The word [untill] in Scripture, is often taken for never; it imports not
always, any definite space of time, but signifies an infinite time, or to
eternity. Thus Mat. 1.25. until she had brought forth, etc. (i) never. So
Mat. 5.26. until thou have paid the utmost ^arthing (i) never. So Genesis 8.7. and
28.15. 1 Samuel 15.35. and 2 Samuel 6.23. Psalm. 110.1. Mat. 28.20. 1 Cor. 15.25.

52. The word [none] is often put for few, as Ier. 8.6. no man repented (i) none
comparatively, they were very few. So 1 Cor. 2.8. none of the Princes of this
world (i) few, Isaiah 64.7.

53. The Present Tense being put for the Future Tense, does signify the
certainty of a thing, as Isaiah 21.9. Rev. 18.2. Anadiplosis propl^^^c^, pro
cadet, (...) est ce^^o, brevi, peni^us. Pareus. So Jude 14 the Lord comes (i)
he will as surely come, as if he were now coming.
Babylon the great fallen, is falled (i) it shall as certainly fall, as if it
were already done, the doubling of it also implies the greatness, neetnesse,
and certainty of it^ downfall. Cecidit significat actum instantem and quasi
inch^antem. 2. cecidit (i) j^m cadere incipit, ac brevi prono casu c^det
Babylon. a Lapids.

54. The word [Rather] is not always put comparatively, when two persons or
things are compared, as like and unlike: but sometimes negatively, as a denying
particle, Impropria est comparatio, neque enim quasi (...) ambobus sit
justitia, publicanum Christus gradie tant^^^ aliquo praesert, sed intelligit
cum suisse grat^m Deo: quum Pharisaeus in totum rejectus fuerit. Calvin.
instead of [not] as Luke 18.14. this man went away, [rather] justified then
the other. q.d. not the other, but he went away justified; for the Pharisee was
not at all justified, Mat. 5.^0. neither is there more or less in
justification; but our Savior here uses a popular kind of expression. So John
3.19. men loved darkness [rather] then light. q.d. they loved not light, but
darkness.

Propositio indefinita aequipollet universal^. Keckerm.
55. An indefinite speech in Scripture, is equivalent to an universal, as Job
14.1. Man that is born of a woman (i) every man. So Pro. 28.14. blessed is [the
man] that fears always (i) blessed is [every man] that truly fears God. So he
that believes shall be saved (i) whosoever he be. So, blessed are they that
mourn, etc. (i) all they inclusively, and only they exclusively, etc. The
Scripture abounds in such kind of speeches.

56. The Scripture often puts a thing in the Participle of the Present Tense, to
note a continued act. Fuit aedificans. Montanus.
Thus Cain is said to be building [ Genesis 4.17.] to denote his earthly
affection, and that he made it, as 'twere, his only work to build Cities; he
did not only build, but he was [building] as if he meant to live here for
ever. Thus to encourage us to pray, Audi^ns orationem. Mont.
it is Gods prerogative Royal to be a God [Hearing] Prayer, Psalm. 65.2. he not
once or twice hears, but is continually [hearing] he makes it (as I may say)
his great work to be still hearing, observing, and answering the Prayers of his
people. So Pro. 13.20. he that walks [ ambulans Heb.] with wise men shall be
wiser (i) he who is continually amongst them, and trades (as 'twere) with them,
shall in time learn wisdom from them. So Mat. 24.38. the sin of the old word
is thus described, they were eating, drinking, marrying; not that it is a sin
in it self, to eat, drink, marry; but when men eat and drink excessively, so
much the Participles imply Significat brutorum instar fors ventri deditos.
Beza. Edere and bibere non est peccatum, his vero negotiis immori, vel deditum
esse cum Dei contemptu, scelus exitiosum est. Pareus.
(...) (i) edentes, like brute Beasts, they did not only eat, but they were
always eating, it was their Trade and work; they passed without intermission
from eating to drinking, from drinking to marrying, etc. they followed it
close, as if it had been their only work, and they born for no other end. So 1 Timothy 5.17. Ministers must be (...), laborantes; still laboring for God, and
spending themselves in his service. So Ephesians. 5.20. (...), gratias agentes, we
must not give thanks for a day or two but always, on all occasions we must be
giving thanks.

57. The Scripture sometimes denounces judgments, and promises blessings to
the Parents, which yet were fulfilled to their children only. Thus Noah
cursing Ha^s. Genesis 9.25, 26. a servant of servants shall he be to his
Brethren, etc. this was fulfilled in his posterity, the Canaanites, who served
the Israelites under the conduct of Joshua. God promised the Land of Canaan to
Abraham, Canaan datur Abrahamo in praesentia, de jure: Posteris vero
poss^ssione. Parcus.
Gen 13.15. yet not he, but his posterity enjoyed it four hundred years
after, in Joshua's time. Thus Isaac said to Jacob, Genesis 27.29. be Lord over
thy Brethren, and let thy mothers sons bow down to thee. This was not
fulfilled in Esau, who instead of serving, did rather Lord it over Jacob, but
this Prophecy was fulfilled in Esau's posterity, when the Idumaeans and
Moabites were brought under the subjection of David. So Genesis 49 7. I will divide
them in Jacob, etc. where by Jacob and Israel, is not meant the person, but the
posterity of Jacob or Israel.

Exact, clear, and satisfactory in this kind, that I shall only refer the
Reader to them, for full satisfaction in his doubts.

16. Rules to direct us in the right expounding of the Law.
THE knowledge of the Law in its utmost extent and spirituality, is very
necessary for every Christian. We are all by nature, Pharisees, and have high
conceits of our selves; and though many will confess themselves to be sinne^s
in gross, Psalm. 119.96. Gods Law is exceeding broad, and reaches further then
duties or vice^ expressly there named. Blake on the Covenant. p. 19.
yet descend to particulars, and then I have had many that could keep all the
Commandments: Now when such shall be made to see the spiritual nature of the
Law, and how it condemns, not only the gross act, but also the secret
corruption of our hearts; heart-murther, heart-pride, heart-theft,
heart-adultery, etc. they will us, humble make us poor in spirit, sensible of
our own impotency, and inability to any goodness; when in this glass we shall
see the numberless number of our sins, and those Seas of wrath due unto us for
them; this will make us fly to Christ, as to our City of refuge, and prize a
Savior above all the Kingdoms of the world, etc.

2. As the Law is a glass for detection, so it is a Rule for direction, by
which all believers must frame their lives, serving him who has redeemed them,
in Righteousness and Holiness all their days: and therefore it is very
necessary for all Gods people, to know what vices are forbidden, that they may
shun them; and what duties he enjoines us, that we may practice them. To this
end I have taken some pains to collect all the Rules (which in my little
reading I have met with) that give any light into the Commandments, that
having a compendium of them at hand* we might have recourse to them on all
occasions: as for the particular opening of every commandment, I shall refer
the Reader to Mr Brinslyes Watch, Mr Whately, and Dr Downhams Expositions of
the Commandments.

1 Rule. Every Precept of the Moral Law, is both Affirmative and Negative,
it is not sufficient that we fly evil, but we must do good, Psalm. 34.14. Mat.
3.10. and 25* 42. Isaiah 1.16, 17. for every Commandment has two parts, the
first, Affirmative, commanding a duty, the neglect whereof is called a sin of
Omission. 2. The Negative, forbidding vice, the doing whereof, is called a sin
of Commission.

2. Under the Negative, the Affirmative is always comprehended: when a sin
is forbidden, Omnia praecepta synecdochic (...) concepta sunt, ideoque ex
vitiorum interdictis contraria virtutum mandata sunt intell^genda. Tilen.
the contrary Grace is commanded; he that says we shall not kill, commands us
also to preserve the life of our Neighbor. Occidisti si non fovisti. Aug. Qui
prohibet impedimentum praecipit adjumentum.

3. When a sin is forbidden in any Commandment under it, (by a synecdoche)
all the sins of the same kind, A principaliori crimine caetera quoque minora e^
assi^^a intellige. a Lap.
are forbidden also. e. g. under adultery is condemned fornication, incest,
^apes, Sodomy, etc. Under murder, is forbidden malice, ra^h anger, ^ighting,
etc. with all kind of murder, M^mento plus ^esse semper in praeceptis ac
interdict^s quam verbis ^x^rimitur.
mental, verbal, real, 1 John. 3.13. and thus Christ himself expounds the
Law, Mat. 5.21, 22. and the reason why God puts the name of the great sin
upon the lesser, is to make us see the heinous nature of it to hate a man, or
give way to rash anger, ^any think it a small matter; but when the Lord tells us
it is murder, then we see the greatness of it: Thus Rebellion is called
Witchcraft, 1 Samuel 15.23.

4. Every Precept is spiritual, Romans 7.14. the Law is spiritual. In omnibus
mandatis ^am interna quam externa (...) p^aec^p^^r.
Man's Law binds the hands and tongue; but Gods Law binds the heart and soul,
John 4.24 it requires not only outward obedience in words and works, but also
inward in the heart and mind; God sees, and punishes as well for inward sins,
as for outward, Mat. 5, 28. it takes notice of heart-adultery; and herein this
Royal, excellent Law of God [ Iam. 2.28.] excels all humane Laws. 1. Men's
^awes take no notice of every small offense, De minutis n^n cu^a^ lex. Reg.
Iuris.
but Gods Law observes and condemns even the least sins, even Gnats as well
as Camels; the Nazarite must not only forbear the wine, but he must not so
much as eat the kernel of the Raisin [ Numb. 6.4] nor the husk. 2. Men's
Laws take no notice of thoughts, Cogitationis poenam in nostro ^o^o nemo luat.
^uriscons.

Praeceptum ultimum per superiora omnia deducendum, ut intelligatur non
exteri^res tantum actus, sed interiores etiam pr^vos motus in illis, prohiberi.
Ge^hard.

I^a Sabba^hum externo ore and interna devotione sanctificandum* prohibet Deus
non externam tan^um opus homicidii, su^ti, adulterii, sed internas etiam
cogitationes occidendi, etc. Wendel.

Quando mand^tur aliquid, mandatur and omne per quod pervenitur ad illud.
Regula.


they cannot punish for them; but Gods Law reaches the heart, and binds the
most secret cogitations. Genesis 6.5. God takes notice of the evil of the
imaginations and thoughts of our heart, he sees our wrath, and observes our
very countenance. Genesis 4 6. why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance
fallen? and the g^ashing of the teeth. Acts 7 54. making mouths, Isaiah 57.4.
pointing with the finger, Isaiah 58.9. those small things which men think
nothing, yet Gods Law condemns.

5. The Law is perfect, requiring perfect obedience, both inward and outward,
both of parts and degrees: therefore when any duty is commanded, there the
highest degree of it is commanded, Mat. 22.37, 38. and where a vice is
forbidden, there the least degree of it is forbidden, and bears the name of a
gross sin, that we might esteem no sin small.

6. When a duty is commanded, the means to attain it are commanded also, and
when a vice is forbidden, the allurements thereto are forbidden* e. g. when the
Lord commands us to worship him alone, this includes Praying, Reading, Hearing
the word, watching over our hearts and ways, and frequenting good company;
hence David bids the wicked depart, that so he might keep the Commandments of
the Lord, Psalm. 119.115.

7. Where any virtue is commanded, a vice forbidden, there also the signs are
commanded and forbidden, as well as the things themselves. e. g. he that
commands us to be gracious, commands us also to show forth the fruits of him
that has called us, and that our light should shine before men, and our
moderation be known to all, etc. 2. For vices, we must not only shun the sin,
but the shows also and appearances of sin* Quando aliquid prohibetur,
prohibetur and illud per quod p^rvenitur ad illud. Reg. Iuriscons.
1 These. 5.22. Jude 23. lofty looks and strange apparel, etc. which are signs
of pride, must be avoided. Isaiah 3.16. Zeph. 1.8. 1 Timothy 2.9. we must shun
lewd company, suspected places, lewd speeches, and all the signs of
incontinency: we must not only abhor the Devils Beef, but his Broth too.
Isaiah 65.4. Jacob must bury the earrings, lest they make an Idol. Genesis 35.4.
The men of Ephesus repenting, burn their books of Sorcery: the Lord condemns
the dregs of sin, as well as the sin it self* he that says we shall not
kill, says also we shall not revenge, no nor once remember the wrong. Le.
19.18.

8. All men are bound to a religious observation of Gods Commandments, none
are exempted, God has not made one commandment for the rich, and another for
the poor; but high and low, rich and poor, Jew and Gentile, bond and free, of
what Nation Sex or condition soever they be, they must observe Gods righteous
commands; Futuro utuntur Hebraei pro imperativo. Non occides (i) ne occidito,
etc.
as God is Lord of all the world, so he expects obedience to his commands, from
all. Hence the Commandments are published in the second person singular [Thou]
speaking particularly to all, etc. thou Lord, thou beggar, etc.

9. The Law must not only be observed, Lex non solum observanda, sed etiam
conservanda.
but also preserved by us. e. g. it is not sufficient that the Master keep the
Sabbath himself, but he is bound to see that all his family observe it also;
and so in every other Commandment; it is not, sufficient that I do not kill,
but I must do what in me lies, to preserve others from killing. We must
therefore in our places and callings, by instruction, direction, correction,
etc. labor to prevent sin, in all about us, else we may become accessaries to
other men's sins, and that seven ways.

1. Mandando. 2. Comm^nda^do. 3. Permi^tendo. 4. Provoca^do. 5. Consentiendo.
6. Difendendo. 7. Consociando.
1. Mandando, by commanding and giving direction. David did not kill Uriah with
his own hands, but giving directions to Ioab, Quod quis per alium f^cit, id per
se fac^re videtur. Reg. ^^ris.
and writing to him how it should be done, 'twas his murder. 2 Samuel 11.15.
Saul killed the Priest, ^e patratis s^^leribus gl^^^ari, patrantibus
abbland^ri, id de plora^ae est improbitat^s. Parcus.
in commanding Doeg to do it, 1 Kings 21.10.

2. Laudando, by commending men for their pride, drunkenness and profaneness;
it is in a manner all one, to commit a sin, and to commend it. To. 1.32. nihil
interest faveasne sceleri an illud facias. Seneca.

3. Permittendo, by conniving at the sins of others, and not restraining them
when it is in their power. Qui non vetat peccare, cum possit, jubet.
Thus Eli became accessory to the sin of his sons, 1 Samuel 3.13. and Pilate to
Christ's death, John 19.16. and Ahab is said to kill, when he suffered Letters
to be written in his name, to have Naboth killed. 1 King. 21.19.

4. Provocando, by incitation, stirring men up, and provoking them to do
wickedly. Thus did Jobs wife, Job. 2.9. and Iesabel, 1 King. 21.25. a sin
forbidden, Gal. 5.26.

5. Consentiendo, by consenting. Thus Saul was accessory to Stevens death, Acts
7.58. and 8.1. The Hypocrite consents with Thieves, and partakes with
Adulterers, Psalm. 50.18.

6. Defendendo, by justifying the wicked, and condemning the just, Pro. 17.15.
calling evil good, Isaiah. 5.20.

7. Consociando, by being familiar with men in their sin. God has ordained our
non-communion and withdrawing of our selves from them to be a means of their
reclaiming. 2 These. 3.14. have no company with such, Romans 16.17. 2 John 10. 1
Cor. 5.9.

Obligant semper and ad semper, in omni loco and tempore.
10. The Negative Commandments bind most strongly, they bind us always, and to
all times, it is unlawful at any time to sin, I may never blaspheme, curse,
Affi^mativa non obligant ad semper licet semper spectanda sunt pro loco, sed
pro tempore varias accipiunt limitationes and interpretationes.
lie, etc. In the Negative, the acts of vice are always forbidden, but in the
Affirmative, the acts of virtue are commanded, with due consideration of
circumstances; for although they bind us always, yet they bind us not to all
times; we must admonish our brother, read, pray, hear, give alms, etc. yet are
we not bound to these at all times: hence all the Commandments almost, are
Negative. 1. Because Negative Commandments bind more strongly. 2. They work
on our minds, and more then Affirmative ones, 3. Because our nature is
exceeding prone to evi^l. 4. This is the true order of repentance, first to
cease from evil, and then to do good.

11. We must apply the curse particularly, to the breach of every commandment;
if we have profaned the Sabbath, taken Gods Name in vain, etc. the curse is
due to every one of these sins, Deu. 27. ul. Gal. 3.10. and so the blessings,
though they be not particularly expressed, yet must be applied by every one
that yields sincer^ obedience to the Law.

12. Remember, that the first and last condemn the very motions of the heart,
against God, or our Neighbor, though we never yield consent unto them: this
humbled Paul so exceedingly, Romans 7.

13. Sins against the first Table, are greater then sins against the second
(caeteris paribus) comparing thoughts with thoughts, words with words, and
works, the comparison must be equal, as blasphemy, and the highest degree of
sin against God, is greater then theft, or murder: but if the comparison be
not equal, it will not hold, for Adultery is a greater sin, then the least
breach of the Sabbath; and murder is a greater sin then the least abuse of
Gods Name.

14. The second Table must give place to the first; Obedientia primae tabulae
derogat secundae, quando utraque simul locum habere nequit. ut Luc. 14.16.
Gerhard.
hence Mat. 22.38. Christ calls it the first in order and Nature, because the
love of our Neighbor flows from the love of God. 2. The great Commandment in
excellency and dignity, because it more immediately commands things concerning
God. Our Neighbor must be loved but only in and for the Lord, so far as may
stand with his glory: it is no dishonor to our Fathers on earth, to see their
heavenly Father served before them, Ephesians. 6.1. Acts 4.19. and 5.29. Lex
ceremonialis cedit mo^ali. Reg.
This Rule holds in Morals, but not in Ceremonials, for God would rather have a
Ceremony omitted, then our Neighbors safety endangered, Hos. 6.6. Mat. 12.3,
4, to chap. 15.3, 4.

15. We must obey Gods commands, purely for the commands sake, many will seem
to observe them for self ends, to merit, get praise, andc. but we must have
respect to them all, simply, because our God commands them.

16. Precepts presuppose faith* e.g. Do this, and thou shall live (i) do it
in Christ. So Eccl. 12.13. Keep the commandments (i) in Christ or by faith in
him. So, thou shall love the Lord, with all thy heart (i) Evangelically.

17. God who made the Law, can dispense with his own Law in things that touch
not upon his nature, justice, purity, etc. God cannot sin, because purity is
natural to him, he cannot lie, because truth is essentially and intrinsically
in him; but for things which are out of him, and belong to his sovereignty, he
is an absolute Lord, he is Lord of days, and Lord of goods and life; here he
may dispense, and command Abraham to sacrifice Isaac, and the Israelites to
spoil the Egyptians, Exodus 3.22. and Solomon to make Pictures and Cherubins
(which we may not) For, 1. He had Gods express command to make them. 2. They
were Types of Christ, they foreshewed his glory, whom the Angels worship. 3.
They were placed in the holy of holies, where the people could not see them,
much less worship them.

FINIS.
RHETORICA SACRA: OR, A Synopsis of the most material Tropes and Figures
contained in the Sacred Scriptures; by the knowing of which, we may of our
selves observe many more like unto them.

Many Texts of Scripture are here expounded, many errors confuted, and the
Marrow of most Rhetoricians (in reference to Divinity) collected.

All the Tropes and Figures are set in an Alphabeticall Order, for the more
easy finding of them, and illustrated with variety of instances for the better
understanding of them.

Christus Iudaeos ad Scripturarum non simplicem and nudam lectionem, sed ad

To the Christian Reader.
SInce the Sacred Scripture abounds with Tropes and Figures of all sorts, and
is like a pleasant Garden bedeckt with flowers, or a rich Garment beset with
Pearls, or a fruitful field, full of precious Treasures; I conceived it might
be time well spent, to dig into those Sacred Minerals, for the better finding
out of those Metaphors, Metonymies, Synecdoches, etc. which lie hid there: for
the bare reading of the Scriptures, without searching into its heavenly
mysteries and meaning, is like the coming into a Treasury, wherein we see
many costly things folded up, and some ends appearing out, but when they be
all uncovered, then does their glory more affect us for the present, and leave
in us a deep impression of their excellency. Besides, the ignorance of
Rhetoric is one ground of many errors amongst us, as will appear in the
opening of the Tropes, where you have not only bare instances, but many Texts
cleared and expounded, etc. If it may any way be serviceable to thee, give God
the glory, and let the weak instrument have thy Prayers.

ANadiplosis, when a word that is used in the end of one sentence, is repeated
in the beginning of the next, as Psalm. 122.2, 3. our feet shall stand in thy
gates O Jerusalem, Jerusalem is builded, etc. So v. 5. there are the thrones of
judgment, the thrones of, etc. Psa. 145.18. the Lord is nigh to all that call
upon him, See more fully Glassius his Philologia, Edit. 3. p. 1423.
to all that call upon him in truth. So Deuteronomy. 8.7. the Lord brings thee into a
good Land, a Land of brooks. So Isaiah 30.9. Jeremy 2.13. and 12.11. Luke 7.31,
32.

Anaphora, when the same word is repeated in the beginning of sentences, as
Psalm. 29.3. to 10. the voice of the Lord is upon the waters, the voice of the
Lord, etc. So Psalm. 27.1. and 118.2, 3, 4. and 124.1, 2. and 148.1, 2, 3, 4,
and 1^0 1, 2, 3, 4* 5. So Ier. 50.35, 36, 37. a sword is upon the Caldeans, a
sword is upon the liars. Ier. 51.21, 22, 23. Ezekiel. 27.12, 15, 16, 17, 18. Romans
1.21, 22, 23. thou, thou, thou, 2 Cor. 11.20 and 1 Cor. 1.20. Phil 4.8. Amos
1.3* 6, 9.

Antimetabole, is an inversion or change of words, as 1 Cor. 11.8. Man is not
of the woman, but the woman of the man. So 2 Cor. 12.14. children ought not to
lay up for their parents, but Parents for their children.

Antitheton, is the illustration of a thing by its opposite, as Isaiah 5.47. I
looked for grapes, and behold wild grapes, for judgment, and behold
oppression; we looked for light, but behold obscurity; for brightness, but we
walk in darkness.

Anthropopathia, is a figure very frequent in Scripture, as when it speaks of
God after the manner of men, and by bodily things sets forth his divine
excellencies. Thus passions, as Joy, Anger, grief, etc. are attributed to God.
Thus he is said to have eyes, signifying his omniscience, a hand, signifying
his power, wings, to show his care and protection of his people, nostrils,
noting his indignation* etc.

Ar^siopesis, Plena effectu^ reticentia. Bucer. See Glossius. p. 1437.
when out of an holy anger or vehemence, we cut off some word or part of a
sentence, which yet is understood, as Psalm. 6 3. but thou O Lord, how long? q.
d. how long will thou delay to send me help and soccour. So Luke 19.42 O if
thou had known! q d. how happy had it been for thee, if thou had known. So
1 K^n 21.7. do thou now govern the Kingdom of Israel -- Arise. q.d. art not
thou a King? then may thou do what plea^eth thy self, therefore arise
speedily and be doing. Remember this was the counsel of a Iesabel. So Psalm*
95.11. and Heb. 3*11. to whom I swear in my wrath Si, apud Hebraeos ^st nota
jurantis, ut 1 Samuel 14*45.
if they enter into my rest* q.d. they shall never enter into my rest, if they
come there, let me not be God, or let me not be true. So Psalm. 89 35. So 2 Cor.
12 6. I will say the truth -- ^ut now I forbear. So Ver^a abrupta ad
sestinationem re^ notan^^m, and ad ^rep^da^ionem m^^^^dam. Pa^^us.
Hosea 8 1. Trumpet to mouth. Heb q.d. ^et the trumpet to thy mouth, as an
Eagle. Heb q.d. the enemy shall fly swif^ly, as an Eagle, Isaiah 1.13. I cannot
bear your sin. Vehemen issimam indignationem repraesentat.

Apostrop^e, is the turning of a speech from one person to another, many times
abruptly. Thus Psalm. 2.9. the Prophet sets forth Gods judgments against the
enemies of Christ: then ver. 10. he presently turns his speech to the great
ones: Be wise now therefore, O ye Kings. So Isaiah 1.2. the Prophet finding
the people to be rebellious, turns his speech to the inanimate creatures, Hear
O ye Heavens, and harken O earth. So Genesis 49.18. Judge. 5.21, Psalm. 109.21.

Asyndeton, or Dialyton, has no copulative, as 1 Cor. 13.4, 5, 6. charity
suffers long, charity envyeth not, etc. So 1 These. 5.16. to 22. Romans 3.11. to
16. Psalm 66.1 2, 3 Romans 1.29. 2 Timothy 3.2.

Catachresis, an improper kind of speech, as Exodus 20.22. ye have Quasi sensu
percepistis.
seen that I have talked with you (i) ye have heard the Lord speak. So Exodus
23.19. thou shall not sees a Kid in her Mothers milk, mother is not so proper
a term with us, for a dumb creature. So Isaiah 64.1. O that thou would
^end the Heavens and come down! He speaks of God after the manner of men: if
a man were in Heaven, and should descend, he having a body, which is a gross
substance, must needs divide and rend the Heavens, but God being a most pure
spirit, passes through all things, with out any dviding or rending; yet is
there in these divine condescentions of speech, a singular excellency; the Lord
in his goodness, considering our weakness, does even stammer with us, the
better to instruct us. Thus Teachers are said to have a voice, Psalm 6.8. and
39.12. the Lord has heard the voice of my weeping.

Climax, or gradation is frequent in Scripture, when the succeeding clauses
transcend each other, as Mat. 7.7, 8. Ask, Seek, Knock; it is not a simple
repetition, but a gradation. So Romans 5.3, 4, 5. Tribulation works patience,
patitience, experience; and experience hope. So Romans 8.30. Whom he did
predestinate, them he also called; whom he called, them he justified, and whom
he justified, them he glorified. So Hos. 2. 21, 22. I will hear the Heavens,
and they shall hear the earth, etc. So Romans 10.14, 15. How shall they call on
him, on whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom
they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a Preacher, etc. So Iam.
1.2, 3, 4. Temptations prove us, probation brings forth patience, and patience
help^ on toward perfection. So 2 Pet. 1.5, 6, 7. add to your faith, virtue*
and to virtue, knowledge; and to knowledge, temperance; and to temperance,
patience, etc. So Judges 5.30. A work of diverse colors is excellent. 2. A work
of diverse colors of the Needle, is more. 3. Wrought on both sides, that is most
of all. So 1 Cor. 11.3. The head of every man is Christ, and the head of the
woman is the man, and the head of Christ is God. So John 1.1, 2, 3 4, 5.

Ellipsis, the defect or wanting of a word, as Exodus 4.25. Z^pporah took a
sharp [stone or knife] is understood. So Isaiah 1.13. I cannot iniquity (i) I
cannot bear iniquity. So Hos. 8.1. [see before, Aposio^esis.]

Enallage or Heteresis is, 1. Of the Gender, so^etime the Feminine Gender is
put for the Masculine, thus effeminate men are called women, Isaiah 3.12. 2. Of
the person, thus one person is often put for another, as the second for the
third, and the third for the first. 3. Of the number, thus the singular number
is often put for the plural, and so on the contrary.

Epanalepsis, when the same word is put in the beginning, and the ending of a
sentence, as Phil. 4.4. Rejoice in the Lord always, and again I say, Rejoice.
So Psalm. 8.1, 9. and 46.1. ult. the same sentence is put in the beginning and
ending of the Psalm. So 1 Cor. 3.21, 22. All things are yours, whether things
present, or things to come, All is yours. So Romans 15.4. whatsoever things were
written aforetime, were written for our learning. So 1 Cor. 14.15. I will pray
with the Spirit, and with the Understanding also. I will sing with the Spirit,
and with the Understanding also. 2 Cor. 4.3. If our Gospel be hid, to them
that perish it is hid. So it runs in the Original.

Epanodos, when the same word is repeated in the beginning and middle; or in
the middle and end, as Psalm. 114.3, 4, 5, 6. Ezekiel. 32.16. this is the
lamentation, where with they shall lament her, the daughters of the Nations
shall lament her, they shall lament for her, etc. John 8.47. He that is of God,
hears Gods word, ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God,
Romans 7.19. the good that I would, I do not; but the evil that I would not,
that I do, Gal. 2.20. I live, yet not I, but Christ lives in me, and the life
which I now live, I live by faith. So 2 Cor. 2.10, 15, 16.

Epanorikosis, or correction, is the reinforcement of the clause last uttered,
by the subsequent. So Gal. 3.4. and 2.20, have ye suffered so many things in
vain? if it be yet in vain. So Luke 11.27. When the woman cried, blessed is
the womb that bare thee, Christ converts he. verse 8. yea rather blessed are
they that hear the word of God, and do it. Corre^tio, q.d. quid dico
suscitabit? imo ^am constitutus est, and in regno versatur. Iunius.
Commiserationis ergo.
So 1 Kings 14.14. the Lord shall raise up a King, who shall cut off the house
of Jeroboam that day; but what, even now? So Romans 8.34. and 1 Cor. 15.10. I
have labored more abundantly then they all, yet not I, but the grace of God
which was in me.

Epistrophe, when there is the like ending in sentences, as Psa. 136. per
totum. for his mercy endures for ever. Ezekiel. 33.25, 26. and shall ye possess
the Land? ye stand upon your sword, etc. and shall ye possess the Land? So
Joel 2.26, 27. and my people shall never be ashamed, and ye shall eat in
plenty, etc. and my people shall never be ashamed. So Amos 4.6, 8, 9, 10, 11.
yet have ye not returned to me says the Lord, etc. So Haggai 2.8, 9. and 1
Cor. 13.11. when I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I
thought as a child. So a Cor. 11.22. are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they
Israelites? so am I.

Epizeuxis, when the same word is doubled by way of emphasis, as Isaiah 40.1.
comfort ye, comfort ye my people. Isaiah 51.12. I, even I am he that comforts
you. Isaiah 38.19. the living the living, he shall praise thee. Mat. 23.37. O
Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the Prophets. The name is doubled, to
express the great affection of the speaker So 2 Sa. 18.33. Commiserationis
ergo, etc.
O my son Absalom, my son, my son, etc. Thus Deborah quickens her self. Judge.
5.12. awake, awake, Deborah, etc. So Isaiah 51.9. and Ezekiel. 21.9.27. I will
overturne, overturne, overturn it (i) I will certainly overturn it.

And this is done sometimes by way of amplification, as Psalm. 145.18. the Lord
is nigh to all that call upon him, even to all that call upon him in truth. So
Psalm. 68.13. the Kings of Armies do fly, do fly [ fugiunt, fugiu^^] q.d. they
fled amain. ^o Joel 3.14. multitudes, multitudes (i) great multitudes.

3. By way of transition, as Hosea 2.21. I will hear the Heavens, and the
Heavens shall hear the Earth, and the Earth shall hear the Corn, etc.

E^phenismus, is a fair kind of speech, as Genesis 4.1. Adam knew Eve. See the
like mo^est expression, Numb. 31.17. Mat. 1.25. Luke 1.34. Thus Incest and
Adu^^ery is sometimes expressed by a modest term of uncovering the nakedness.
Levit. 18.6. and 20.11, 17. Ezekiel. 22.10. T^us to sanctify, is put for to
defile. D^ut. 22.9. So an Harlot is called Kedesuh, a holy woman. Genesis 38.21.
by a contrary meaning, as being most unholy and unclean. Thus words sometimes
have contrary significations, See more Rule 23.
as Barac signifies to bless or curse. Chesed signifies piety or impiety,
Levit. 20.17. but Psalm. 106.1. it signifies goodness.

Exclamatio is that whereby we express our affection. It is sometimes used per
modum optationis, when we earnestly desire a thing, as 1 Chro. 11.17. Oh that
one would give me of the water of the Well of Bethleem! Isaiah 64.1. O that
thou would^t rend the Heavens, and come down! Psalm. 84.1.

2. Per modum admirationis, by way of admiration, as Romans 11.33. O the depth of
the riches, both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!

3. Per modum objurgationis, by way of reproof, as Gal. 3.1. O foolish
Galathians, who has bewitched you? So Acts 7 51, 52.

4. Per modum Dolentis, by way of lamentation, Romans 7.24. Oh wretched man that
I am, etc.

Exegesis, it is usual with the Scripture, having said a thing in one member
of a sentence, H^c Schema Ecclesiastae frequenter usu^ erit, quoties res poscit
affectum n^si enim i^er^s quod docere vis, praetervolat oration nec acule^s in
animis audientium relinquit. Dress^r.
to repeat the same again, by way of explication or confirmation in the later
part as Psalm 6.8 9. and 33. 10. 2 Kings 20.3. Remember O Lord, how I have
walked before thee, in truth; what is that? an^ with a perfect heart, and have
done that which is right in thy sight. So Isaiah 3.4, 9. and 14.13, 14. John
1.3. Romans 11.7 8. God has given them the spirit of slumber, what is that? eyes
that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear. So 2 Timothy 3.1.
he tells us in general, that the last days shall be perilous, then verse 2,
3, 4, 5. he tells what particular vices should reign, and make the times so
perilous. Yea, such is the goodness of God to his people, that when the
Scripture has spoken any thing darkly, it uses often times to join some plain
thing to give light to it, as Isaiah 51.1. what is somewhat dark in that verse,
is presently explained in the second. So Deuteronomy. 7.3. they must not match with
Idolaters, why so? v^. 4 6. First, because by this means, they will draw you
to worship their gods. 2. This will provoke God to anger. 3. You are an holy
people, sequestered for Gods special service, etc. Thus often, not always, we
have the sense at hand: yet sometimes we must search and go farther off to
find out the sense of some places, which we read.

Hendyadys, when one thing is divided into two, as Mat. 4.16. in the region and
shadow of death, for, the shady region of death. So Mat. 20.20. Worshipping and
desiring (i) desiring by worshipping.

Hypallage, when the order of the words is changed, as Job 17.4. thou have hid
their heart from understanding (i) thou have hid understanding from their
heart. Dominum praesepis (i) cognovit Dominum in praesepio se alentem. a Lap.
So Isaiah 1.3. the Ass knows his Masters crib, or, he knows the Master who
feeds him in his crib. So Heb. 3.13. through the deceitfulness of sin (i) by
deceitful sin.

Hysterologia, or Hysteron-Proteron, is a placing of that before, Crebra
Hysterologia utitur Ieremia.
which should be after, and somethings after, which should be before. The Pen
men of Scripture, do not always observe the just order of things, but the
truth of the History; they set them down, in that order, in which they came to
their minds, and not in that order, which they fell out in. Psalm 7.14. he
travelleth with iniquity, and has conceived mischief. Here the birth is set
before the conception. [See more in Rule 27]

Hyperbole, is twofold. 1 Vel Epitasis (^) intentio, cum verbi vires
intenditur.
Auxesis, when we increase the signification of a speech. So Genesis 29.31. Jacob
is said to hate Leah, when he only neglected her, and loved her less. So Mat.
10.37. compared with Luke 14.26. and John 12.25. We must not simply hate
father, mother, life, etc. but comparatively, when they come in competition
with Christ. So Pro. 13.24. he that spares the rod, hates his son (i) he does
not truly love him, that lets him go astray to his own destruction, and so
acts the part of one that hates him. Thus Genesis 13.16. Abraham's seed shall be as
the dust of the earth, and stars of Heaven (i) his posterity shall be very
many. So Psalm. 51.7. whiter then snow. Lam. 4.7. whiter then milk, more ruddy
then Rubies. So 2 Samuel 1.23. swifter then Eagles, stronger then Lions. 2 Samuel
2.18. swift as a Roe. Isaiah 49.2. I have labored in vain yet not altogether
in vain, though for little good. So Genesis 11.4. and 13.10. Isaiah 7.15, 25.
Joel. 3.18. the hills shall flow with milk, and the mountains with wine. So
Canaan was styled a Land flowing with milk and honey, Numb. 13.27, 32, 33.
Cities fenced up to Heaven, Deuteronomy. 9.1. So Psalm. 107.26. they mount up to
Heaven, and go down to the depths (i) they are sorely tossed up and down.
Gal. 4 15. ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them me;
it is a proverbial speech, q.d. you would have parted with your dearest things,
to have done me good. John 21.25. the whole world would not contain the books
(i) they would be very many. John 12.19. the whole world goes after him (i)
many follow him. Luke 18.1. Pray To semper, idem est quod sedulo perseveranter,
assidue. a Lap.
always (i) be constant and persevere in the duty. Mat. 6.3. Acts 2.5. Mat.
19.24. it is easier for a Camel to go through the eye of a needle. [See more,
Rule 19.]

2. Me^osis, Litote, Tapinosis; when less is spoken, and more is meant. Pro.
3.11. despise not the Lords correction (i) highly esteem it. Rom 2.4. despise
not the riches of his goodness (i) prize it highly. Mal. 2.14. she is thy
companion (i) thy chiefest and choicest companion. Heb. 13.4. whoremongers and
adulterers God will judge, (i) he will plague them here, and condemn them
hereafter. Heb. 10.38. my soul shall take no pleasure in him (i) I greatly
abhor him. Psalm. 105.15. Touch not mine anointed (i) hurt them not. 1 Samuel
24.14. whom do thou pursue, a dead dog, a ^^ea? (i) a poor, weak,
contemptible person. Mat. 7.23. depart from me, I know you not (i) I detest
you, and will for ever punish you. Mark 3.29. shall never be forgiven (i)
shall be eternally punished. Mat. 12.20. a bruised reed he will not break (i)
he will cherish and preserve it. Psalm. 5.4, 5. thou art a God that take no
pleasure in wickedness (i) thou greatly hate it. John 11.11. Lazarus sleeps
(i) is dead. Levit. 26.36. thou shall fly at the shaking of a leaf. Romans 4.19.
not weak in faith (i) very strong in faith. Revel. 12.11. they loved not their
lives unto the death (i) they exposed their lives to all danger, for the cause
of Christ. 1 Cor. 10.5. with many of them, God was not well pleased (i) he was
highly displeased. [See more, Rule 18.]

Insinuation, is a holy Rheroricall winding our selves into men's affections;
sometimes by loving and sweet compellations, as Romans 12.1. I beseech you
brethren. Sometimes by appeal, as 1 Cor. 11.13. Judge in your selves is it
comely. Sometimes by Anticipation, as Acts 26.27. beleevest thou the Prophets?
Est in hac Apostrophe acer stimulus quo pungit Agrip pam, ut creda^ in
Christum. a Lap.
I know thou beleevest: he would even persuade him, that he believed, and verse
29. I would to God that not only thou, but that all that hear me this day, were
both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds; they yet knew not
that bonds and suffering for Christ, was a great honor, and therefore he puts
in this exception.

Ironia, Ironicall, taunting speeches may lawfully be used, as occasion serves.

1. God himself used them. Genesis 3.22. the man is become as one of us (i) as one
of the Trinity, Voluit Adam nobis per esum pomi sieri similis, en quam factus
est dissimilis! voluit scire bonum and malum, en in quale ignorantiae barathrum
corruit. a Lap.
whereby God declares his great disdain of their affectation of an impossible
pre-eminence in being like to God. q. d. by his sin he is become most unlike to
us. See how well Satan has performed his promise to man, is not he become like
one of us? and has not he gained a goodly measure of knowledge, both of good
and evil? So Judge. 10.14. Go, cry to the gods which ye have chosen. It Is an
Ironicall upbraiding them for their Idolatry, which they found so comfortless,
in their greatest need, their Idols being no way able to deliver them. So
Isaiah 14.4 8, 9. God himself teaches his people to de^ide the proud King of
Babylon.

2. Christ used it, Mat. 26.45. sleep on. q.d. go to now, sleep on, take your
rest if ye can, behold a perilous time is at hand, wherein ye shall have
little list or leisure to sleep.

3. Elijah used it to the Worshippers of Baal. 1 Kings 18.27. he mocks them,
and bids them cry aloud to their drowsy or busy god, peradventure their Baal
was asleep, or in a journey, etc. So Mica ah bids Ahab go up and prosper (i) go
up and perish, 1 Kings 22.15. So Io^ [17.2.] taunts at his fal^e friends, in an
ironicall expression: No doubt but ye are the people, and wisdom shall dye
with you. q. d. in your own conce^t, there are no men in the world but you. No
doubt but reason has left us, and is given wholly unto you; yea wisdom is so
tied to your persons, that her conservation and mine depends on yours. So Amos
4.4, 5. come to Bethel, and transgress at Gilgal, Si sapis, metu mortis and
divini judicu resiaena tuas voluptat^s, resist tuis cupid^tatibus, amores
va^^s ^uri si^a, ut jud^i qui concissi^ earum usum. ^ed v^^u it abusum
con^ruonired^las rationem. ^ Lap.
multiply transgressions, etc. q. d. since by no means ye will be reclaimed,
but are desperately set on sin; go on, and fill up the measure of your sin.
Thus Solomon, without any breach of charity, or stain of holiness, checks the
young man's ^olly, with an nony, Eccl. 11.9. Rejoice O young man, etc. but know,
etc. by an ironicall concession, he bids him (...) joyce and take his pleasure,
etc. and then mary's all wi^h a s^inging but, in the end. So Paul with an holy
scoff, derides the Corinthians, 1 Cor. 4.8, 10 ye are full, ye are rich, you
reign as Kings, etc. we are fools, ye are wise, etc. we are nothing, you are
all. etc. [ ironica est concessio, exprimens Corinthiorum de seipsis corruptam
opinionem. Aretius.]

A Sarcasme, which is a biting taunt, is near to an Irony, but that it is
somewhat more bitter, as Genesis 37.19. behold the Dreamer comes! Thus Michal
spits out bitter reproaches against David, 2 Samuel 6.20. How glorious was the
King to day? (i) how contemptible and inglorious? Thus Shimet reviled him, 2 Samuel 16.7. Thus the people taunt at Moses, Exodus 14.11. because there were no
graves in Egypt, have thou brought us to dye in the wilderness? Thus the Jews
reviled Christ, Mat. 27.29, 42. In gestu magis quam verbis ostenditur, fitque,
cum naso suspenso quippiam fastidimus (...) enim est nasus. See Mr Leigh on the
word (...)
Luke 4.23. they mocked him, saying, Hail King of the Jews. Nah. 3.14.

Mycterismus, is a kind of scoff, near to the former. Thus the Pharisees
derided Christ, Luke 16.14. they did not simply contemn him, but they showed
their contempt of him by their gestures; they blow their noses at him, as the
original imports, [(...), deridebant eum, vel sannis eum excipiebant. Beza.

Metalepsis, when there are many Tropes in one word, as Mat. 21.10. all the
City was moved; the City put for Jerusalem, by a synecdoche generis, and
Jerusalem put for its inhabitants, by a Meton. subj. So Mal. 4 2. wings put for
beams, by a catachresticall Metaphor, and beams for comfort and refreshing, by
a metaphor.

Mimesis, is an imitation of the words of others. Thus David uses the words of
rebellious Rulers, Psalm. 2.3. let us break their bonds asunder, etc. So Paul
uses the words of the Epicures. 1 Cor. 15.3^. and the Prophet speaks in the
language of the Profane Jews, who made a mock at Gods word and threatenings.
Irrident verbum Dei, habentque pro balbutie inepta. Musculus.
Isaiah 28.13. Manda, remanda, expecta, reexpecta, Tsulazu, Kaw, lakau, Kau
lakau, Micah 3.1^.

Metaphors are frequent in Scripture, for our apprehension sake. Thus Christ is
called a Rock, a Vine, a Lamb, a Lion, a Shepherd, a Door, a Wav, an
Husbandman. So man is called a shadow, a flower, grass, a Woolfe, Bear, Dog,
Isaiah 11.6. Thus we read of Metaphors from Leaven, Salt, Trees, Seed, Bread,
etc. besides many hyperbolicall Metaphors, as Psalm. 65.13. the fields sing.
Hab. 2.11. the stone out of the walls shall cry. Lam. 1.4. the ways mourn.
Genesis 4.10. thy brothers blood cries. [Hee that would see more Scripture
Metaphors, from seeing, hearing, smelling, touching, tasting, etc. let him
peruse Peachams Rhetoric.

Metonymia, 1. Of the efficient cause, thus Moses is often put for the writings
of Moses. Luke 16.29, 31, and 24.27. John 5.45, 46. N^x^ caput sequitur and
paena culpam individua^, uti lictor ^eum, conitatur
Thus sin is put for the punishment of sin, Genesis 4.7. sin lies at the door
(i) the punishment of sin. So Numb. 32.23. your sin will find you out (i)
the punishment of your sin. Thus John 7.39. the holy Ghost was not yet given
(i) the miraculous and sanctifying gifts of the Holy Ghost, were not to fully
given, as they were after Christ's ascension. So Gal. 3.27. ye have put on
Christ (i) ye are made partakers of his benefits. Psa. 128.2. lab^ur, put for
the food gained by the labor of the hands.

2. A Metonymy of the Subject. Thus by a Sacramental Metonymy the Scripture often
gives to the Sacraments, the names of the things signified by them. Thus
Circumcision is called the Covenant, Genesis 17.10. when 'twas only a Seal of
the Covenant, and the Paschall Lamb is called the Fuit s^gnum illius
transitus. Met. sub.
Passover, Exodus 12.11. and Baptism is called the Newbirth, Titus 3.5. and
the bread Christ's body, of which it is a sign, Mat. 26.26. So the cup is put
for the wine in the cup, Luke 22.20. (i) vinum poculo contentum, continens pro
re contenta] Thus the earth is put for the men in the earth, Genesis 6.11. the
earth was corrupt. So Jerusalem, Iudaea, Samaria, are put for their
inhabitants. So the house for the people in the house. Luke 19.9. Salvation is
come to thy house, Act. 26.31. Pr. 11.29. Hebraei per M^tonymiam, qua continens
pro contento ponitur, Deum vo^can^ Scamaim (i) ^oelum. a Lap.
Thus Hell is put for the Devils in Hell and Heaven, for God who dwells in
Heaven. Luke 15.18. I have sinned against Heaven (i) against God who dwells in
Heaven. So Mat. 21.25. Thus the days are put for the men that live in those
days. Ephesians. 5.16. and the nest, for the young ones in the nest. Deuteronomy. 32.11.
as an Eagle stirs up her nest (i) provokes her young ones to fly. So the
heart is put for all in the heart, the will, affections, and the whole soul,
because the soul keeps its chief residence there, though it be in the whole
body, and every part of it. Ier. 17.9. the heart is deceitful (i) the soul
with all its faculties and affections. So Deuteronomy. 30.6. Psalm. 4.4. commune with
your heart (i) with your soul. Ier. 4.14. wash thy heart (i) thy whole soul.

Thus the gate is often put for the Judges, who (among the Jews) sat in the
gate, Mat. 16.18. 1 Samuel 4.18. and 9.18. Psalm. 69.12. So the tongue is put for
the speech. Pro. 10.20. the tongue of the just, is as choice silver. So Pro.

this world (i) of the wicked who live in the world. So 1 Cor. 11.10. the woman
has power on her head (i) she has a veil or cover, which is a sign of her
husbands power and superiority over her.

has slain his thousand. So Christ is put for his members. Mat. 25.35. I was
hungry, and ye gave me meat (i) my faithful members. So Acts 9.4, 5. I am
Jesus whom thou persecutest (i) whose Disciples thou persecutest. Psalm. 16.6.
the lines are fallen (i) the portion divided to me, by cords o^ lines. Isaiah
34.17. Psalm. 78.55.

Thus the Abstract, is often put for the Concrete. Iustitia est adjunctum hominis.
Psalm. 11.7. the righteous Lord loves righteousness (i) righteous men. Jacob
swear by the fear of his father Isaac, Genesis 31.53. (i) by the Lord, whom
Isaac feared. So Ephesians. 3.10. Col. 1.16. 1 Cor. 12.28. Helps, Governments, for
Helpers, Governors. So circumcision, for the persons circumcised. Gal. 2.12.
So Paul is called (...), Acts 24.5. Sic scelus pro scelesto, and exi^^iale
vocant (...) (i) exitium, per Autonomasiam. a Lap.
not only a pestilent fellow, but the very pestilence and plague it self.

abominable. So the belly is put for a Belly-god. Tit. 1.12. and wickedness for
wicked men, Genesis 19.15. [See more, Rule 36.]

Kingdom, Genesis 49.10. the sword for authority, it being a sign of it. Romans
13.4. the keys, for Ecclesiastical* power. Mat. 16.19. Thus the Name is often

the truth. Pro. 18.10. the name of the Lord (i) the Lord himself. Phil. 2.10.
Ephe. 5.20. Acts. 1.15.

Thus the time it self is put for the thing done in time. 1 Cor. 4.3. q. d. I
expect another day, beside man's day; now man carries all before him, he has
all the doings now, he may judge and censure as he pleases, it is but his day,
and I regard it no^.
man's day (i) ^ans judgment; save me from this hour (i) from this danger.
John 12.27. So Job 32.7. days should speak (i) the aged who have seen many
days.

4. A Metonymy of the effect. 2 Kin. 4.10. death is in the pot (i) poison or
some deadly thing, which causes death. So Mar. 9 17, 25. a dumb spirit (i)
making men dumb. Romans 8.6. to be carnally minded is death, (i) tends to
death, or brings death. So Romans 6. ult. and 7.7. is the Law sin? (i) is it
the cause of sin? Heb. 11.39. they received not the promises (i) the fruit of
the promises, for they had the promises, but the accomplishment was in the time

of the dust. Psalm. 105.18. he was laid in Iron (i) in setters. Psalm. 115.4.
their Idols are silver and gold (i) made of such metal.

Paranomasia, is a pleasant sound of words, as Psalm. 21.7. In te confisi,
nunqua^ confusi. So Isa. 5.7. in the Original, is an excellent Paranomasia.
Mispal Mispach, Zadaca Zeaca. So Romans 2.1. in quae al^um damnas, teipsum
condemnas* (...). So in the Greek there is an exc^llent Paranomasy. 2 Cor. 4.8,
9. (...), etc. haesitamus, at non prorsus haeremus. So Mat. 8.22. let the dead

24.7. Phil. 3.2.3.19. [See the Originall] 2 Cor. 6.10. as poor, yet making many
rich, as having nothing, and yet possessing all things. So Bethel shall be
Beth-aven* Amos 5.5. Psalm. 25.16. Gna^ any, af^flictus ego etc. Hosea 4.18.
a^abu hebu am^nt ^ona.

Periphrasis, is the using many words for one thing. Thus John 21.20 the
Disciple whom Jesus loved (i) John. The fruit of the vine (i) wine. To lay down
this Tabernacle (i) to dye. The Doctor of the Gentiles (i) Paul. The Father of
lying and murder (i) the Devil. So death is called the going the way of all
the earth* because none can escape it: and Solomon calls it our long home, etc.

Pleonasmus, the most wise God condescending to our rude and weak capacity, often
uses sacred P^eonasmes, ^or the better clearing of things to our
understanding, and beating them into our dull apprehensions. So Deuteronomy. 13.4.
those inculcations are not vain, but serve to work things the better upon our
hard hearts. So Deuteronomy. 32.6. O foolish people and unwise. 1 John 1.1. we have
seen with our eyes, etc. John 1.3. and 6.33, 34, 35. Mat. 5.2, etc. Christ calls
himself seven times there the bread of life. The Psalms are full of such
pleonasticall inculcations. The Scripture is o^t exegetical, what it speaks
darkly in one place, it explains in another.

Polyptoton, is a variation of cases, as Romans 11.36. of him, from him, to him,
etc. John 17.25. 2 Cor. 12.14 Luke 8.5.

Polysyndeton, when words and sentences are knit together, with many
copulatives, as 1 Cor. 13.1, 2, 3. and though I have the gift of prophecy, and
understand all mysteries, and all knowledge, etc. So Gal. 4.10. To. 8.38, 39.

Prolepsis, or Hypophora, is the prevention of an objection, as Pro. 3.9.
Honor the Lord with thy riches. Ob. So I may beggar my self: he prevents this
objection, so shall thy barnes be filled. So Mat. 6.33. first seek spirituals,
above and before temporals. Ob. So I may impair my wealth, health, etc. He
prevents this, all these things shall be cast as an overplus into the
bargain. So John 11.2. [See more, Rule 27.]

Prosopopaeia, the faining of a person, as when we bring in the inanimate
creatures, speaking or hearing, etc. So 1 Kings 13.2. O Altar, Altar, thus
says the Lord: he speaks to the Altar, as if it were a person that heard him.
Psalm. 98.7.8. let the sea roar, and the floods clap their hands, and the hills
rejoice. Romans 8.19, 20, 21. The Apostle brings in the creature waiting,
groaning, traveling. So Isaiah 35.1, 2. he attributes joy and singing to the
wilderness. See a most lively, rhetorical, prosopopeical description of the
terrible Army of the Babylonians, Joel 2.1.10 12. So Joshua 24.27. this stone
shall be a witness, for it has heard all the words of the Lord. Isaiah 1.2.
Hear O Heavens etc. Judges 9.8. Iotham brings in the trees, speaking like men.
The Olive will not leave his fatness, nor the Figtree his sweetness, nor the
Vine his wine, to reign over others; Stultitiae est, ab^ect ^ liberate,
spresis piis Magistratibus, omnem potestatem impio, improbo, crudeli nebuloni
committere. Wolphius in locum.
but it is the bramble, that affects sovereignty and dominion, a base,
scratching, worthless, fruitless shrub, good for nothing but to stop gaps,
and keep out beasts, from spoiling the pleasant fields, and afterward to be
burnt. [ Rhamnus exilis est, unde vix umbram jacit quae protegar, ac sub se
delitescentes pungit and stimulat. a Lap.

Synecdoche generis, when a general word comprehends the particular. Mar.
16.15. Go preach the Gospel to every creature (i) to every rational
creature. Psalm. 1.6. the Lord knows the way of the righteous. viz. with a
knowledge of favor and approbation. So Amos 8.14. they swear by the sin of
Samaria (i) by the Idol that is placed there (i) the golden Calves. Thus
wickedness is put for Idolatry, Zach. 5.8. and for Incest, Levit. 20.19. Thus
the Philistine is put for Goliath, the Apostle for Paul, our Savior for
Christ. Mat. 11.18. John came neither eating nor drinking. viz. after the
common manner. Gen 31.21. Jacob fled over the River (i) Euphrates. Psalm. 19.7.
the Law of the Lord (i) the whole word of God. 1 Cor. 6.12. all things are
lawful (i) all adiaphorous things. Ier. 8.6. no man (i) very few.

Thus the whole is often put for a part, as Mat. 3.5. all Iudaea went forth (i) a
great part. So 1 Kings 10.24. all the earth went to hear the wisdom of
Solomon. Mat. 4.23. he healed all diseases (i) all sorts of diseases presented
to his cure. Luke 2.1. all the world was taxed (i) all the Provinces belonging
to Augustus. 1 Timothy 2.3. who will have all men to be saved, etc. (i) all the
Elect, of what Nation or Degree soever. Romans 10.12 God is rich to all (i) to
all that truly call upon him. Heb. 2.9. he tasted death for every man (i) for
every sanctified man. ver. 10. All in Scripture, is often taken distributively,
for some of all sorts, not collectively for the whole mass of mankind. The
ignorance of this distinction is the ground of many errors amongst us.

Thus the plural number is put for the singular, as Mat. 27.44. the thieves
(i) one of the thieves upbraided him.

2. Synecdoche speciei, when a particular implies the general, Mat. 4.4. and
Per panem, ^ntellige o^nia hujus vitae admi nicula, ut cibum, potum, vestimenta.
6.11. bread (i) all kind of food. So Genesis 3.19. Thus peace is often put for all
temporal blessings. So a brother is put for a Kinsman, Mat. 12.47. thy
brethren are without (i) thy kinsmen Caesar for the chief Magistrate. Mat.
22.21.

Thus a part is put for the whole, Romans 13.1. let every soul (i) let every man
be subject. So the roof is put for the house, Mat. 8 8. So Genesis 46.26. all the
souls that came out of Egypt. Eze. 18. the soul that sins. So the body is
put for the whole man. Romans 12.1. Thus prayer is often put synecdochically for
the whole worship of God. Luke 18.20. two men went up to the Temple to pray (i)
to worship God. So Rom 10.12, 13. Joel 2.32. Acts 2.21. Genesis 4.26. and 12.8.
first, because it is a special part of Gods worship, very pleasing to him. 2.
Because prayer must accompany every Ordinance, Luke 18.12. I fast twice in the
Sabbath (i) in the week. A potiori die hepdomas vocatur Sabbathum. a Lap.
Thus often the denomination is given from the better part; as Sion for all
Jerusalem, and Jerusalem for all Judah.

Thus the fear of the Lord is often put for the worship of God. Pro. 14.26.
Psalm. 130.4. Deuteronomy. 6.13. Acts 10.35. Psalm. 128.1 and 112.1.

Thus the hand is put for the whole man, Pro. 10.4. and the head for the whole
man, Pro. 11.26. blessing shall be upon the head of, etc. Pro. 3.22. grace to
thy neck (i) to thy whole man.

Thus the singular number is put for the plural. Ier. 8.7. the stroke knows
her time (i) the strokes. Numb. 6.24* 22. the Kenite (i) the Kenites shall be
wasted. Job 14.1. man (i) all men have but a short time.

Thus a certain number is put for an uncertain. Zach. 3.9. Christ is said to
have seven eyes (i) many, to signify his singular care over his Church. So
Rev. 1.20. and 5.6. Deuteronomy. 28.7.25. ^^y seven ways (i) many ways. Psalm. 12.6.
Job 5.19. Psalm. 119.164. seven times a day. Pro. 24.16. the righteous falls
seven times a day (i) often. Eccl. 11, 2, 9. Mat. 12.45. seven other spirits,
etc. If any desire to see these Tropes and Figures more fully explained, let

subversion of Universities, Philosophers, Physicians, Magistrates, Ministers)

Pen.

The Preface to the Reader.
Courteous Reader,
AFter I had finished my Vindiciae Literaru^, or Schools Guarded, my Stationer
sent me down one Webster, an enemy to Arts and Artists, desiring me to send
some brief Answer to it; upon this I fell to examine Websters Examen and found
him so soul false and bitter against Humane Learning, and Universities (both
which I defended in my Vindiciae) that I thought it convenient to vindicate
what I had asserted, and to leave the Logical and Philosophical part to be
examined by those whom it more especially concerned: which since I penned my
discourse, I find to be done so elaborately and accuratly, by Dr Wilkins, and
Dr Ward.
two very learned pens (in their Vindiciae Academiarum) that I was resolved to
lay my own Answer by, and had done so, but that I received a very learned
defense, of Aristotelian Logic, which I judged worthy of the public view. If
thou reap any benefit by this Tract, let God have the praise, and the Reverend
^cute Logician thy thanks, whose elaborate Animadversions, have drawn this,
from thy

Friend and Servant in the Lord, THOMAS HALL.
Kingsnorton S^p^e^b. 4. 1654.
Examen Examinis: OR, A word to Mr Webster, concerning his examination of
ACADEMIES.
SIR Hercules, (for in that Title I perceive you glory) in your Epistle to the
Universities, you tell us that you never feared any Adversary, for his supposed
strength and if any one inquire Who, or What you are, you tell him, that you
are neither Prelaticall, Presbyterian, nor Independent. But what shall we then
call you? if any one ask, tell him (say you) that Hercules is easily known by
his foot, and the Lion by his paw, etc. We see then who you are, viz. an
Herculean-Leveller, a Famalisticall Lion, Iesuita est omnis homo. Our Webster
is some kin to them, for he can change with every time, etc.
a dissembling Friar, a Profane Stage Player, and professed friend to Judicial
Astrology and A^^rologers, such as lying Ly-ly, Booker, Culpepper, etc. A great
stickler for the fire and Furnace of Chymestry, for Magic and Physiognomy,
etc. I must confess I never ^et saw your person; but let me tell you, I have
seen your Lions paw, and Levelling club, wherewith you think to beat down
Universities, Humane Learning, etc. and in their stead, to set up your own
Idle and Addle conceits. What spirit leads you, appears [ page 8 of your book]
where you tell us, Arrius is called a Heretic, but you question how justly [a
tender conscienced n^an indeed] but as for the Orthodox, Woe to them! for you
tell us they all wrest the Scriptures to make good their Tenants [a heavy
charge, could you make it good]

The Proverb says, Ne Hercules contra duos sed t^^ contra ducentos, imo (...).
If Hercules may not ^ight against two, what an Hercules are you, that dare
oppose more then two thousand, and Goliath-like, bid defiance to all the
Academies and Armies of the living God: you tell us plainly, that in your ^igh
flowne conceit, Homo is a common name to all men. All those viri Dei, those
holy-learned men of God, which are in the Land, if they be not of your
Familisticall-Levelling-Magicall temper; they are all in your eye, but h^mines,
plebeian, low and common men, etc. How much better had it become you, like
Hercules, to have endeavored the cleansing of that Augaean stable of errors,
Heresies and blasphemies, which like a Morphew, have overspread the face of
the Church; to have cut off those Hydra's heads, and helped our Atlasses to hold
up the Heaven of the Church. It had been more for your credit and comfort to
have employed your time and Talent in defense of Languages, Arts and Sciences,
(especially in such a season as this, when so many decry them) then thus to
weave the Spiders Web, which may peradventure catch some feeble flies, when
stronger ones break thorough.

Bibitur auro venenum.
It Is true, sometimes you gild over your errors with golden words, and set a
gloss upon your false wares: but poison is never the better for being drunk
out of a golden cup, the whore of Babylon deals so with her guests, Rev. 17.4.
and the Apostle tells us, that false Teachers, with fair words and fine
speeches, do deceive the simple, with plaistred words, they parget over the
matter. Romans 16.18. 2 Pet. 2.3. Alludit ad Mercatores qui verb^s fictis and
art compositis, supra veritatem laudant and extollunt suas merces, ut faci^ us
cas extrudant, and carius vendant. Sic Haeretici ut suam haeresim divendant,
and spargant, ^am blandis and elegantibus v^^bis adornant, and quasimeretricem
sermonis lenocinio fucant, ut videatur pulchra and elegans inslar Helenae.
(...) Lapide in locum.
(...), fictitiis verbis quia more plastis ac figuli multa confingunt, ut
haeresis suae idolum velent, vestiant and ornent.

But that you may see your folly the better. 1. I shall begin with your
contradictions. Sometimes you plead for Academicall learning, and anon you cry
it down; like a Thief, we sometimes find you in the way, and presently you
are crossing it again. Thus [ page 3.] you cry up Humane Learning as good,
excellent, and of manifold transcendent use; whilst moving in its own Orb,
it enables men for all kind of undertakings, Military and Civil, without
which, men do not differ much from beasts, etc. [So page 8, 9.] yet as if you
had forgot what you had said, in the same page you tell us (how truly let the
world judge) that this humane learning, disables men for the Ministry, is a
vain Tradition, and makes men incapable of Gospel mysteries, etc.

Quo teneam vultus mutantem protea nodo?

So, one while you plead for teaching children without the Grammar Rules [ page
22] yet page 24. you cry up Mr Brinslyes way of teaching, which every one
knows (who knows the Method of that Godly man) has reference to Rules.

2. Your sophistry, and fallacious arguing is very frequent, to give you a
taste only, I find it done already, very acurately, by Dr Ward in his
Vindiciae Academiarum.
(for as you desire to stir up some to plead your cause, so I doubt not but
some of the Lords Worthies, who have more time and Talents for such work, will
arise and plead his cause more fully.)

1. He Is against Learning.
You tell us, that humane learning puffs men up, makes men selfe-confident and
proud; that it is but a carnal thing, a fleshly power, (just so say your
brethren, the Familists, and Anabaptists) that the I have proved the contrary
in my Vindiciae Literarum*
Apostles never taught or practiced any such matter, but bad us beware of
Philosophy, Col. 2.8. for it is a fleshly weapon, earthly, sensual, divelish,
an Idol of man's inventing, spiritual sorcery or enchantment, yea Reason is a
Monster, and the very root and ground of all Infidelity, etc.

Answ. Behold here that Damask-Web, (as his verifying friend calls it) which Mr
Webster weaves. 1. He Argues from the abuse of a thing, to the taking away its
use; because some men abuse humane learning to pride, and selfe-conceitednesse,
therefore away with humane learning, Non sequitur; for then, because some men
abuse, meat, drink, clothes and riches; we must throw away meat, drink,
clothes and riches.

2. It is not Philosophy simply, that the Apostle condemns, Col. 2.8. but
vain, V. Vindiciae Literarum. c. 2. page 30.
spoiling, abusive Philosophy; as you may see more fully in my vindication of
that place.

3. Neither is humane learning a carnal, fleshly, sensual Idol of man's
inventing; but the good gift of God, coming from the Father of lights, who is
purity it self: As I have proved at large, in my Vindiciae Literarum.

4. Neither is Reason a Monster* (as you Monster-like affirm) but being
rightly improved, is a great help in Religion; as is excellently proved, by
the learned Culverwell in his profound discourse, of the light of Nature: fit
it is fit we should give unto Reason, the things which are Reasons, and to
Faith, the things which are Faiths.

Ob. But it is the spirit (says Master Webster) that must teach us, and the
spirit that must unlock the Scriptures, and the spirit that must inlighten us,
etc.

Answ. True, but yet the spirit of God works by means (as I have proved before
in my Vindiciae.) Who ever expects help from God, V. Vindiciae Literarum,
Prefu.
must not sit still and dream the spirit will help him; but he must arise, and
serve Providence in the use of means; for the spirits Teaching does not
exclude, but include the use of all good means, etc.

Yet that you see Mr Webster's Herculean strength, he comes now to grapple even
with Aristotle himself [ c. 6.] this Chapter he spends wholly, He Is against
Aristotle.
in combating with him; no less Adversary then the Prince of Philosophers can
try his strength. 1. He tells us, that Aristotle was but a man, and so might
err; and is not Mr Webster a man? and does he not err with a witness? 2 He
tells us, that what Aristotle has written, was rather by a Diabolical, then a
Divine instinct [I rather suspect that he is led by a Diabolical instinct,
that speaks it.] 3 His Principles are false, his Manners corrupt, many of his
books spurious; besides, he is ambiguous, brief, ^ame intricate, erroneous
etc. In a word, a blind Pagan, the proud Stag^rite. I wish he were not more
blind, corrupt and proud that speaks it]

Qu. But since Aristotelicall Philosophy will not down with Mr Webster, what
new-light shorter cut, and easier way has this Hercules found out: for like
another Caesar, Viam aut invenie^* aut faciet. He Will ^ither find a way, or
fra^^e you one out of his empty sconce?

Ans. Why, it is Magic [ page 68, etc.] that noble, No^e, it is Diabolical
Magic, which Webster pleads for, as appea^s by his commending Lilly the Wizard.
and almost divine science (as he calls it) of natural Magic. This key (if you
will believe him) will better unlock natures Cabinet, then syllogismes; yet he
co^plaines, that this is neglected by the Schools, yea hated and abhorred, and
the very name seems nauseous and execrable to them. [and that very justly
considering whether your Magic leads men] But O Magic, Magic, where have
thou ^ame hid so long, that Mr Webster is feign to conjure thee up again, and
none but he and his associates, could find out this short cut before? It Is
true, there is Astronomy, which is an Art that considers the diverse aspects,
and natural properties of the Stars, and this is lawful. But then there is
See Perkins 1 Vol. p. 39* and 43, 44.
Magia Diabolica, a Divelish Magic, when men take upon them, to foretell
things contingent, by the Stars, those are called judicial Astrologers, and in
Scripture they are often joined with Witches, wizards, and Sorcerers, Deu. 18 10,
11. Dan. 2.2, etc. yet this Devilish Art, does Mr Webster plead for [ page 51]
and spends welnigh a page, in the commendation of Astrology and Astrologers,
such as Lilly, Booker, Culpepper, andc. 1. He calls it a Science or Art. The
learned Weemse 4. Tom. on the Magitian. page 62.
Weemse has proved the contrary; yea, the Lord Verulam (whom he cites so often)
is here against him. Lord Verulam's Advancement of Learning. p. 147.
Astrology (says he) is corrupted with so much superstition, that there is
hardly to be found, any sound part in it. Aug. de doct. Christian l. 2. chap.
21.
S. Austin that had studied this way, yet concludes, Astrologia est magnus
error, and magna dementia, etc. it is a great error, a great madness, and
superstition easily refelled.

2. Yet he calls this a high, a noble, an excellent Astrologia judiciaria non
est Scientia. These. Cantab. 1654.
Science, and useful to all mankind; a study, not unbeseeming the best wits,
and greatest Scholars, no way offensive to God or true Religion, etc.

A dangerous and false assertion, the contrary whereof, is most true in the
judgment and experience, See Wendelius Physic. c. 27, 28. page 620.630. and
Weems Magitian. sect. 7.
of all godly learned men such as Calvin Beza, Perkins, Weemes, Gataker, Geree
Vicars etc. they all condemn it, as a most ignoble, dangerous study,
unbesee^ing choice wits, offensive both to God, and all good men. Hence these
judicial Astrologers were formerly excommunicated, and cast out of the Church;
and by the Decrees of Emperors, banished out of the Commonwealth. Never more
need of punishing such offenders, when they are grown so bold, and
brazen-faced, as to publish their lies and abominations in Print to the world,
and so provoke God to forsake us, Isaiah 2.6. Therefore thou have forsaken thy
people, because they be replenished from the East, and are Southsayers, like
the Philistines. It Is an Art that leads men to the Devil, I have conferred with
some, and read as much of others, who have gone about to study this Art (as
Webster calls it) they have been feign to throw away their books, for fear of
Satan's appearing; so ready is he to step in, when once he finds us out of Gods
way Usuallie, such are Wisards, and therefore I cannot but wonder how Mr
Webster durst be so impudent, as to commend the worth, virtue, and learning,
not only of these lying, deluding Prognosticators, Booker and Culpepper, but
he also extols that lying, railing, ignorant Wizard, Ly-ly, who has not only
reviled the most learned and Reverend Mr Gataker, with the Orthodox Ministry of
the Land; but with his lies, has abused both Church and State, to the great
dishonor of the Nation: as appears by the pious and judicious Mr Gataker's
Vindication of his Annotations, on Ier. 10.2.

And since Mr Webster talks so much of this noble Science, and what sufficient
Reasons he could give in defense of Mr Lillie's Astrology, he may do well in
his next Pamphlet, to prove it a science, and to bring forth his strong
Reasons. In the mean time I shall love humane learning the better, whilst I
live, because it is opposed by Star-gazers, and judicial Astrologers: as David
loved Gods Law the more, because wicked men sought to destroy it, Psalm.
119.126, 127. the Father tells us, Nil nisi grande aliquod bonum quod a Nerone
damnat^m, It must needs be good, which wicked Nero hates. So humane learning
must needs be good, which Astrologers and Wizards hate and oppose. And that
you may see the same spirit which breaths in Lilly, dwells in Webster, he uses
the lying, railing language of Lilly. Shall the thundering Pulpit-men (says
Lillian Webster) who would have all men's faith pinned upon their sleeves [this
is as true as all the rest] and usually condemn all things they understand not
[it seems Mr Webster knows more in this Art, then honester men do,] make me
silent in so just a cause? [Oh no, it is a ^ime of liberty, and you think you may
be bold, but such as you must know, that though you may for a time, escape the
punishment of men, yet you cannot escape the revenging hand of the Almighty,
but as you have sinned against the Lord, so be sure first or last, your sin
will find you out. And yet that all the world may see what spirit leads this
man, it is worth observing, whom he commends, not only Lilly and Booker, but also
Friar Bacon [ sic mulus mulum, it becomes one Friar to claw another] and
Paracelsus, a Libertine, a Drunkard, a man of little learning, and less
Latin; he was not only skilled in natural Magic, (the utmost bounds whereof,
bordered on the suburbs of Hell) but is charged to converse constantly with
Familiars, See more, Fullers Ho^y state, lib. 2. cap. 3.
and to have the Devil for his Pursebearer, yet this is one of Mr Websters
society. Noscitur ex comite, etc. Like Lettice, like Lips; such as his company
is, such is he.

Add to this, his praising the study of Physiognomy, as an excellent, laudable,
and profitable Science; [which yet the Learned judge vain and foolish] also
his extolling of Chemistry, and preferring it before Aristotelian Philosophy,
and advising scholars to leave their Libraries, and fall to Laboratories,
putting their hands to the coals and Furnace. [So they may quickly find pro
thesauro carbones, beggary instead of Learning, and walking thus in the sparks
of their own fire, lie down in sorrow, Isaiah 50.^^.] this is Mr Webster's
short cut, a quick way to bring men to the Devil or the Devil to them.

2. Mr Webster having sufficiently railed on Aristotle, the Prince of
Philosophers, next he falls foul on Galen, 3. He Is against Galen, and
Physicians.
the Father of Physicians, only for building on Aristotle's Principles; out of
his ignorance, he calls him an ignorant Pagan, an Idol, a blind guide, etc.
and at last falls foully on the Physicians themselves [ page 107.]

4. He'^ against Ministers.
3. He comes now to Ministers, and railes on them, for suffering themselves to
be styled by that blasphemous title of Divines; this the Priests (that Title to
show his contempt of the Ministry, he puts on the Ministers of the Gospel,
though that Title be never given them, qua Ministers in all the New Testament)
blasphemously assume to themselves.

Ans. 1. It Is false, the Title is not blasphemous, for it is given to S. John,
who is called by way of eminency, and distinction, (...), The Divine. As
Theology and Divinity are terms convertible in our language, so is a Theologue
and a Divine, the same in sense, though it differ in sound: and therefore if
the Scots do well (as you say they do) in calling their Ministers Theologues;
then ours do not ill, in speaking plain English, and calling them only for
distinction sake, Divines (i) men set apart for the study of Theology or
Divinity. Now see the wit, or if you will the malice of this Magus, this
Magitian (for he pleads for the lawfulness of such Titles.) The Scots (says
he) may call their Ministers Theologues; but our people, may not call their
Ministers Divines. This distinction is like the man's, that said, Pepper was hot
in operation, but cold in working.

2. It Is false that we assume it, much more that we blasphemouslie assume it to
our selves* if people will give us that Title, only for distinction sake, who
can hinder him?

3. The ground he builds on, is rotten. viz. 1. Because holiness is
essentiallie proper to God. 2. Be cause we are Holy and Divine by
participation only, therefore we may not be called Holy and Divine.

Ans. The answer is easy. Though to be holy and Divine, be essentially proper
unto God, yet by way of Analogy and resemblance, it is also given to Angels
and men. Hence the godly in this life, are called Saints, holy, and in the very
letter, partakers of the Divine Nature, [2 Pet. 1.4.] not essentiallie, but
Analogicallie, partaking of those graces whereby we resemble God.

He Is against Magistrates
4. He falls foul on Magistrates, and te^s them plain^ie [ page 98.] that they
must not at all intermeddle with the things of God, lest miser^e and
destruction follow them to the grave, etc.

Ans. What is this but to destroy the Magistracy? to rob them of their
coercive power, and make them like Saint George, that sits with a drawn sword,
but never strikes (a sit emblem of Mr Websters Magistrates.)

Ob. But Mr Webster would have them punish Thieves, Murderers, Adulterers and
Drunkards, only they must not punish the Saints, lest God require the blood of
his Saints at their hands. [ page 98.]

Ans. 1. If the Magistrate must punish Thieves, Murderers, etc. then a
fortiori he must much more punish spiritual Murderers, Thieves, etc. for as
it is a greater sin to kill the soul, then to kill the body, so they deserve
severer punishment. It Is no Policy, but cruelty, to suffer Woolves and Foxes to
destroy the flock: neither is the coercive power of the Magistracy, under the
Law, abolished by the Gospel, as is excellently cleared by Mr Prin, in a
Treatise called the Sword of the Magistrate; and since by Mr Cobbet on the same
subject.

2. The Saints must be considered under a double notion. 1. As Saints walking
up to their principles and living in the fear of God, and he that abuses and
kills such Saints simply on this account, must look to answer for their blood.

But 2. Consider the Saints, as erring and wandering from their Principles, by
Adultery, Murder, Drunkenness, Heresy, etc. and so they may and must be
punished, though not as Saints, yet as sinning and transgressing Saints: yea
though they should plead conscience for what they do, and say, as Mr Buroughs
in his Irenicum* c. 6. p. 34 proves.

Thus you see, how Mr Webster is against learning, against Aristotle, against
Magistracy, against Ministry, against Physicians, and against all that is
truly good: like Ismael, his hand is against every man, and therefore it is just
that every man's hand should be against him.

Q. But what is the sum of Mr Websters desires, and what would he have us to
study?

A. He tells you. 1. That you must lay aside al your paper Idols, and slight
Aristotle, who has in him, many things frivolous, vain, false and needless.

2. He tells you, that you give up your self to Mathematics, Optics,
Geometry, Geography, Astrology, Arithmetic, Physiognomie, Magic, Protechny,
Chemistry, Pneumatithmy, Stratarithmetry, Dactylogy, Stenography, Architecture;
and to the soul ravishing study of Salt, Sulphur and Mercury [a medicine for
a Hor^e] These, these, if you will believe Mr Webster, are the only excellent
studies for Academians.

But Sir, if these inferior Arts (the alwfulnesse of some of them being
justly questionable) be so useful and excellent as you affirm, then a
fortior^ Logique (which you slight as prejudicial to Theology) and Physics,
Ethics, etc. with the superior Arts and Sciences, must needs be much more
excellent, and therefore Mr Webster is much to be blamed, for crying up those
low, inferior, empty things; and crying down those choice, ingenious,
useful Arts and Sciences, which do so much fit and further men in their
preparation to Divine studies.

To conclude, the world may here see, what stuff still comes from Lame Giles
Calvers shop, that forge of the Devil, from whence so many blasphemous, lying,
scandalous Pamphlets, for many years past, have spread over the Land, to the
great dishonor of the Nation, in the sight of the Nations round about us, and
to the provocation of Gods wrath against us, which will certainly break forth,
both upon the actors and tolerators of such intolerable errors, without
speedy reformation and amendment.

Since I framed this discourse, there came to my hands, a very accurate and
learned Examen, of Mr Websters illogicall Logic, which now follows in it is
order.

Examen Examinis. An Examination of Mr WEBSTERS Illogicall Logic, and
Reasoning even against Reason.
THis Mr Webster (as I suppose) is that Poet, whose Glory was once to be the
Author of As the D^vils Law-Case.
Stage-plaies, but now the Tutor of Universities. But because his Stage Players
have been discountenanced by one of the late Parliaments; does he^ therefore
address himself to the Army* for the like force, and as little favor in
behalf of all Humane Learning? for advancement whereof, Reperto quod est
optimum, qui aliud quaerit, pejus vult. Quintil.
the best way being already found, he that seeks for another, desires worse
(and so none at all) though he pretend to a Reformation. For my own part, I
could wish that his Poetry still had flourished upon Mr Iohnson's account, in
his Epistle before one of his Plays (the Fox) to the two most equal Sisters;
the Unniversities (a far better address, then this here) but it is odious to be
like the Fox in the Fable, who having lost his own Orna^ent, envied his
fellows theirs, by pretending burden or inconvenience. I have neither leisure
nor lust, to examine all his Examen; but yet to know Hercules by his foot, I
cannot but observe* how in his Chapter of Logic, he Reasons against Reason:
and as Diogenes accused Plato, with a worse pride of his own; so he prosecutes
Aristotle, under the name of Arch-Sophister, indeed with his own sophisms;
which what may we call but envy and pride, those two Mothers (says Aquinas) of
discord: whilst one through envy, recedes from the way and will of another,
through pride, to prefer his own As Quintilian (if that Dialogue de Oratoribus
be his) condemns the Oratory of his time, as abused to incense the people in
Principes viros, ut est natura invidiae: not sparing (not only Sy^la and
Pompey, but) even Scipio himself; or as Livy: Et ante alios in Caemillum.

But what if Oratory be thus abused to calumniating, should there be therefore
no Oratory at all? or if Logic to cavilling, no right reason at all? as indeed
there is none such without the orderly use of it, for rationis est ordinare
(says Aquinas) and that is best done, not by the Web which is here woven, to
unravell all Humane Sciences, but by the Art of Logic. Such a Master whereof,
was Aristotle* that of him we may say for knowledge, as for virtue, Valerius
Maximus of the said Scipio, Quem Deus immortalis nasci voluit, ut asset in quo
se virtus per omnes numeros hominibus efficaciter ostenderet.

But let us see, what against so gloria light, and to falsify the sight or
sense of all ages hitherto, is here produced by him, who hoc tantum rectum quod
sap^t ipse pu^at.

Chap. 4.. 1. What here he says, is no more then may be objected against any
Science or Art (though never so much by himself approved) e. g. his own late
Poetry, and now beloved Astrology (yea the Gospel of Peace it self may be
abused for war and discord:) but whatsoever Finis operantis
the aim of the Logitian is, the Finis operis.
end of the Art is truth.

As to that of Aristotle, for which so vehemently he inveighs against, or
rather proudly insults over him; the more strongly the opponent maintains his
part (for which purpose in his Topics, he supplies him with store of
Arguments) the respondent his, the more effectual is their disputation, for
the end thereof, viz. the di^covery of truth: as Scaliger says, ut ex silice
and ferro elicitur ignis, it^ conflictu ingeniorum veritas. And besides, in his
Politics also, he observes the rules to be kept for upholding Tyranny: but
will Mr Webster therefore conclude, that he allows of that way of Government?

Sect. 2. Or is truth his own end, in accusing whole Universities of most
rational men, and even Logic it self, as proceeding very preposterously,
whereas, Logic is indeed the Mistress of all due method to all Sciences, and
to himself if methodicall. As if the Prince in whom as supreme consists the
Order of the whole community, should be accused himself for breaking it, which
as such, whether good or evil, he keeps, though if evil, not so well as he
might; and by keeping his subjects in it, preserves them by it: for all things
consist in order, which confounded, they come to naught. Logic, as such,
proceeds orderly, directing the mind in the knowledge of truth, as first in
the apprehension of simple Terms, and then in the composition and division of
the same, and last of all in Discourse, without confusion, falsehood, or
fallacy. In which last, it proceeds as well a posteriori, by induction, to find
out the truth, or to know that such an affection is the true property of such a
subject: as a priori, by demonstration, to perfect the knowledge of it: for
then is the knowledge distinct and perfect, when the thing is known as it is,
as the effect by the cause, as it is by its cause, which is the order of
Nature: and not the cause by its effect, which is our Method, through the
imperfection of our Intellect, deriving its notions from sense, and so
beginning a posteriori, but a part rei, indeed preposterous. First, then does
Logic proceed preposterously, because to advance our Reason as near as may
be, to the Angelical manner of understanding, by knowing things (as they are
distinctly and perfectly) it teaches us to proceed in the order of Nature, or
to begin a priori? 2. As to say that induction has altogether been laid
aside, is most false, and against sense: So Reason requires that syllogismes
(wherein we prove and demonstrate the effect by the cause) be preferred before
it. So that whilst he extols (and for a new method of his own, against all
established and approved order) so highly cries up induction before syllogismes,
his own is the error which he condemns, and therein he proceeds
preposterously.

Sect. 3. Here also the defect pretended, is his own; in not acknowledging,
both how fit are the denominations of Genus, Sp^cies, etc. to the Notions
thereby expressed, and these Notions adequate to the things we conceive by them.
For gathering of which Notions, the certain Rules which he seems to desire,
but indeed rejects them, are these two. Comparison of things, as to that
wherein all agree, for the community, and abstraction thereof, from
differences, whether essential or accidental, for the unity of the simple
essence, which has thus the general denomination of an universal, and is
either of one kind comprehending infinite singulars, accidentally only
different, as Homo, and so is fitly expressed by the word species: or generally
comprehensive of diverse kinds, both constituted in themselves, and distinct one
from another, by their proper essential differences, as Animal, Animatum,
Compositum, Corpus, Substantia, and so as fitly is called Genus; which is
either summum, and so is not at all; as a species it self subordinate, as
substantia, or subalternum, which in re^pect of a superior, Genus it self is
a Species, and to alterno respectu both, as Corpus, compositum, Animatum,
Animal.

The Genus then is divided into several species, which are either subalternae,
as having under them other Species, in respect whereof they are also Genera: or
infimae, as superior to no species at all, but only to its own singulars; in
which the division rests, as in so many Individuals.

Now, have we not here, both notions adequate to the things, and words as fit
to express these Notions? or in all this excellent order, can Mr Webster
invent confusion?

But he would show, that he has read, and seems to understand the Lord Bacon,
in his Novum Organon, though his testimony be nothing for him, Sin^tiones ipsae
confusae sin^, etc.
as Hypotheticall, and so not Propositio hypothetica nibil ponit in esse.
Positiv^ly true, till the condition be first proved: but without any proof
thereof Mr Websters Thesis is absolute, and so false.

Sect. 4. The said Notions, and determinations, concerning which, there, are
given a few, plain, ca^e, necessary and usefu^l Precepts, are some of the
hardest passages wherein are exercised the unski^full and tender wits of young
men: and so far are the Questions and Disputes, which are agitated by riper
judgments, from derogating from their Art, that rather they add to it, etc.

Ans. Whereas here he objects that they do not see that they act as foolishly
(even those of the best judgments) while they dispute of the very Art of
Disputing, as he that endeavors to see the proper vision of his own eye: his
own is indeed the blindness, in not seeing the difference of Understanding
and sense.

Turpe est doctori, cum culpa redarguit ipsum. For the eye, or the outward
sense, apprehends not its own Act, being neither color, nor light, nor the
difference of its own, from the proper objects of other senses. e. g. that
which pronounces White to differ from sweet, is neither the sight nor taste,
whereof each apprehend but one of them, and so cannot judge of both 3. but the
inward or common sense, as judge of the Acts and Objects of all the outward:
whereas the Understanding, whose object is universal, or all things knowable,
is re^flexive to know it self, its own Acts and Objects* and then* as the
soul of man is both the Object, Subject, and Author of its own disputes,
while by reflection, it knows it self. So the Logician reflecting upon his own
faculty, may dispute of what sort it is, whether Science or Art, which, as
directing the mind by its denominations, propositions, syllogismes, where the
end is to act accordingly, is an Art; and yet as reflecting upon it self, its
own Acts and Objects, where the end is knowledge, may be called a Science too.

Sect. 5. How can he blame the Stagirite, for not defining or disputing, what
Logic is, what a Category is, what substance or quantity is; if herein he
should act as foolishly, as he that endeavors to see the proper vision of his
own eye. But ad rem. Neither is he indeed, nor his Interpreters, guilty of
such defects, as here he fancies, and fastens on him, whose end is contention,
to make the contention endless. But for the proposition and distribution, two
of his subjects.

Magnus Aristoteles trutinando cacumina rerum*

In duo divisit quicquid in orb fuit.

The members of which two heads, he handles in their order: Nor is therefore
his Organon, so organized, a confused headless piece.

But such is his own objection against his book de Interpretatione, where the
Moods of Propositions, are made neither more nor fewer then four, viz.
necessary, impossible, possible, and contingent. For what is so plain, as that
the matter of all discourse, is either necessary, or impossible, or possible,
or contingent; and so may well be reduced to these four. Manners or Moods, so
called, because they specify, how the predicate belongs, or not, to the
subject of the proposition; For all that we can conceive or express, is either
necessary, if it cannot but be, or impossible if it cannot be, or possible,
if it may be, though it be not yet, nor ever shall be; or contingent, if it be
or shall be, though it might not have been, or may never be.

But see here, how Mr Webster, so subtle and quick-sighted in seeing the
Defects of Aristotle, is blind in his own. See it in his own instances.
Having pr^mised the definition of a Mood, that it does modificate the
proposition (i) indicate how the predicate is in the subject, he infers, and
insults, may not all Adjectives by the like right be Moods? No, because they
are all reduced to those four before mentioned: but he says, if this be a
Modall proposition, it is a necessary thing, that man is a living Creature,
these also are Modall; it is an honest thing, that a man should be studious of
virtue; it is a just thing, a son should obey his Father; it is a gallant thing
to dye for ones Country. Where, if his propositions be these, man is studious
of virtue, the son obedient to his Father, one dies for his Country, their
matter is all contingent. Or if these; man to be studious of virtue, is an
honest thing, a son to obey his Father, a just thing, one to dye for his
Country, a gallant thing; so his Adjectives are no Moods at all (to show how
the Predicate is in the subject) but themselves the Predicates, and in all his
propositions, the matter is only necessary.

So that his error is, as if Aristotle had designed to assign the Modall, as
a distinct species of proposition, and not only to give one general Rule, for
all the species before enumerated, as that their matter is either necessary, or
impossible, or possible, or contingent.

Sect. 6. Nor is he more Orthodox or busy, to better purpose, in the matter of
definition, where the office of Logic is, only to give the Precept or Rule,
how it ought to be made, which to explain by example, it takes the instance
from other Sciences: Nor is Logic to define what Homo or Animal is, this being
the part of Natural Philosophy, as to treat of it is proper subject. Now the
precept which Logic gives for the definition of things in actu signato, as
that it ought to consist of the next Genus, and a constitutive difference, is
^ost true, exact, and infallible: and therefore i^ in actu exercito, animal
rationale, be not indeed the true definition of man, the error is the
Philosophers, who must find out for his own subject, the next Genus, and
constitutive difference (as religiosum, or the like, i^ not rational^)
according to the Rules and Precepts, which in Logic he has for both; to make
(by the Rules for that too) the definition exact and perfect: So that the same
which Mr Webster before objected against Logicians, as that they seem to make
Logic a part of Physics, he is guilty of here himself.

But because as an open enemy to our Physics, as well as our Logic, he would
equally glory in the defects and errors of both; the truth is that the error
is all his own: for that bruit beasts are irrational creatures, and so
rational the proper difference of man, it appears. 1. By comparing, as man
with Angels, so the said bruits with man: For Angels are intuitive, mere or
simple intelligences, as seeing both in the sight of the subject, what is
attributed or denied to it without composition or division: and in the sight of
the Principle, what flows from it without discourse^ and so we men also are
intelligent creatures, but not as Angels, the operation of whose Intellect, is
only the apprehension of simple terms, and not liable to falsehood; for
besides that we have two other, to compound or divide, and to discourse, and so
are rational too; which being thus our essential difference, little lower
then the Angels, is yet common to us with bruit beasts.

2. That Rationale is not a graduall only, but our essential difference, it
is evident at least by this, that whereas Gradus ^on variat speciem, in us
specifically distinct, is the principle of reason, from any in bruit beasts, as
appears As Mr Webster says, that we know nothing in nature, but a
posteriore, and from the affections and properties of things must seek for
their causes.
a posteriori, by the properties of it, as aptitude to speak, etc. which we
have as rational.

And whereas further he says, that irrational is negative, and so can
positively prove nothing. This his sequel were true, if it were negative
secundum rem and not only se^undum ^ocem. e.g. immortal is also negative, and
yet if St Paul's Argument from the word mortal, be of force, when he says,
(...) not sin raign^ in your mortal bodi^s; how much more is that of St
Peter* abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against your [immortall] souls.

Now as immortal (applied to God, Angels, and the reasonable souls of men)
implies more then a mere negation of dying, for otherwise, all things but
living creatures, should be imortall. So irrational, speaks the positive and
specificall nature of a bruit beast, as rational, that of man, though in so
great a scarcity and inequality of words to things we be destitute of a better
way to express the same: for why do we say, that the Ox^ is irrational, and
not as well that the stone is so, since the negative of reason in both is
alike, and the habit undue to both; but that irrational* implies* that
positive Nature, whereof the one is partaker, and not the other.

2. I should wonder that one who is so contentious, seeking all occasions to
cavil, should omit division; were it not hereby evident, that he has nothing
to say against it.

But why does he make such have in his wrath against Reason, to come to
Argumentation? or what can be made more absolute (without addition or
alteration by some curious wits, in so many ages of men) or so exact as our Art
of syllogizing. But Novelists moved with the spirit of pride and envy, are out
of love as with all that others have invented, and not themselves, so even most
with the best, for the greater glory of reformation. Yea whereas other
inventions are concerning such outward things* as we use more seldom, we have
continual use of our own Reason* and yet still is our Art of syllogizing, so
imperfect a thing, that now one should presume to abrogate it? He mislikes,
that so many sorts of our syllogismes conclude negatively, since it is
sufficiently known, that de negativis non da^^r scientia* but does he not know
as well, that por negativa datur? yea, himself says, and alleges his Author
for it, that humane Science does consist in a certain negation of falsity,
rather then in the affirmation of verity.

It is undenyably true (says he) that the knowledge of the premises is more
certain, then the knowledge of the conclusion, and therefore undoubtedly
certain, that the knowledge of the conformity, betwixt the premises and the
conclusion, does praeexist in us; where both the consequent may be true, and
the antecedent; but how do they hang together? Grammatically indeed in the
Copulative words, and therefore: but he defies all Logical ways of Arguing.
Or how is it that the said knowledge before, and without the syllogism, may
be said to be, or praeexist in us? not in Act, but only in aptitude (as Alex.
Alens^ Metaphys.
one says, that aptitudo ad rem est aliquid ipsius rei;) which aptitude is
reduced to Act (without which it should be in vain) or the knowledge (says
Mr Webster himself) excited by syllogizing; and yet is syllogizing also in
vain? or in procuring that act, useless? else why does he say, and therefore
why do thou torment and macerate thy self in that question, which is more
subtle to despise then to dissolve? which (since nothing can be inferred from
a thing wherein it is not contained) is another therefore without inference*
subtilty beyond sense, and a sleighting or despising (not of some vain
question, but) of so useful a thing, as the best of Logic it self, against
reason.

Ob. And so is that which here he objects, saying, that sometimes from false
premises, there does follow a true conclusion, as in this syllogism, Nullum
adorabile est Creator,
Omne simulacrum est adcrabile, Ergo,
Nullum simulacrum est Creator.


Nor can it therefore be judged, that the conclusion of syllogismes, does of
necessity compel Assent, or that the conclusion does necessarily depend upon
the premises, as the truth is not contained in a lie, nor the knowledge of it.

Ans. 1. We say not that that in syllogisms, which of necessity compels, assent
is the conclusion it self, but the premises, when out of them it is rightly
proved (i) when the premises both are true and well ordered in Mood and figure,
Assent to the conclusion is made necessary; for ex veris nil nisi verum, and
that by virtue of the right order and disposition in Mood and Figure, for
otherwise out of true premises, there may follow a false conclusion: as Omnis
asinus est animal,
Omnis homo est animal, Ergo,
Omnis homo est asinus.


So then we are taught in the first and second part of our Logic, to make the
premises true, and in the third, so to dispose and order them, as to
necessitate Assent to that, which we make our conclusion from; and yet is all
this so despicable, that Mr Webster extolling his own subtlety, and the force
of his Understanding, should not only, not seek, but reject it is true helps?

2. The conclusion indeed does necessarily depend upon the premises, in respect
of the form at least, as the conclusion of a true syllogism, and so does that
of his syllogism before mentioned: or in respect of the matter too, as a true
conclusion* and so not.

3. Whereas it is objected, that as the truth is not contained in a lie, so no
more is that true conclusion in the false premises.

The premises both are true (i) they are true propositions for the substance,
categoricall, for the quantity universal, for the quality, vocis; the one
Negative, the other Affirmative; and re^, both false; yea even because false,
they are therefore true propositions. For in simple terms, and in speeches not
enuntiative, there is neither ^alshood nor Truth; but if you make Homo, or homo
albus, either true or false, you make a true proposition of it; and if to one
such, you add another in Mood, and Figure, there is true disposition too, for a
true syllogism. So that even the true conclusion of false premises is
contained in and deduced out of them, in respect of the form, for so are they
also true* though not in respect of the matter, since that is false.

Lastly, To all that in the residue of the Chapter, he objects or cavils
against Logic, may that serve, which before was answered? as that by direction
thereof we do defend the truth, as the true definitions of things, and infer
out of true premises, rightly ordered, undeniable conclusions, whereby we have
not only bare Opinations, Putations, or probable Conjectures; but infallible
Science, and Apodicticall to inform and satisfy the Intellect, by evidentiall
demonstration.

Whereas Mr Webster cavilling against all reason, contradicts and confounds his
own. As first, when he says [ Numb. 4.] a Chemist when he shows me the
preparation of the Sulphur of Acrimony, the Salt of Tartar, the Spirit of
Vitrioll and the uses of them, he teaches me that knowledge, which I was
ignorant of before, the like of which no Logic ever performed: having said
immediately before, that demonstration, and the knowledge of it, is in the
Teacher, in whom it serves to demonstrate and to show it others, who learn it
of him. Again [ Number. 5.] he condemns all Logic, as conducing to no other
knowledge, then such as is duly probable and conjecturall; as if that were not
more then such, which is acquired by demonstration.

Besides, he most highly extols Astrology, and the now Professors thereof, his
friends, as common enemies with him, as well even to Divinity it self, as to
Logic and humane learning; who presume by their Art, to foretell As the fall
of Law and Divinity.
such future contingencies, as depending on man's free will, are not known to
Angels themselves, unless by Durand and others.
conjecture only, or revelation. And have any the best Astrologers, so clear
a Light, as to see by the Heavens more, then these Heavenly lights themselves,
or as Mr Webster, then all wise men? Yea how grossly have they failed in
things even merely natural, conjecturing at As Mr Sanders, one of the most
learned of them.
rain and showers, during all the late winter drought; but not at all of the
later rain, as if God had provided both to discover their grand Imposturage and
presumption, if not impiety, in taking men off from himself the first, to
ascribe all or too much to Nature, and second causes.

All which is to me, a sufficient evidence, that this great Examiner,
notwithstanding his fair pretenses of Reformation and truth, might, if
thoroughly examined himself, be found not steering his course indeed by right
zeal to these, In his Epistle Dedie.
but by that which he also seems to disclaim, even selfe-interest.

However, certain it is, that truth or reformation, cannot be truly sought in
a way against Nature as is here Mr Websters in preferring himself, before all
the wisest and best in all Ages, to inform and Reform his Mothers, the
Universities; for Quicquid exprimitur in natura, imprimitur ab intelligentia,
scil* explicante, mediante nature. Alex. Alcus^ etc:

Opus naturae est opus intelligentiae.


Nunquam aliud Natura, aliud sapientia dicit.
Nature Gods own true wisdom is, and then,
Is never tharted by the truth of men.
