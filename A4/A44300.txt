ABINGTONS AND ALISBVRIES Present Miseries.
THe cruelty of those insatiate vultures the Cavaliers has been so abundantly
testified through most part of this kingdom, that many hundred of poor
wretches with daily execrations curse their violence, which has in no place
been extended with more rigor then at the two good Towns of Abington and
Alisbury, sisters in calamity, only Alisbury appears the elder, having
preceded Abington some days in her misfortune. Alisbury a very Signal Town
in Buckingham shire, still loyal to the Commonwealth, whither about some five
days since, a thousand of the Cavaliers, all Troopers, came Commissary Wilmot
being their Commander in chief under Count Robert, who was not there in
person. Well, thither they came, and billetted themselves for that night in the
best Innes, and other houses of quality about the town, being indeed
indifferent courteously entertained by the Inhabitants of Alisbury, more for
fear then love, they hoping by their friendly usage to mollify their savage
disposition of their unwelcome guests, who they knew were apt for all
mischiefs men durst attempt, caring neither for God nor the Devil, But, as
says the Poet: Quo semel est imbuta recens servabit odorem
testa Diu. --


It was impossible to alter the customary proceedings of the Cavaliers, which
is resulted into a second nature, their rapine and theft, seeming as
individual to them, as if it were their inseparable essence.

In the morning therefore these violaters of all divine and humane Laws, began
to put in act all their determined purposes, and every one to fall upon the
house that he was harbored in, which in most outrageous and inhumane manner
was exposed a prey to their ravenous appetites, neither the entreaties of men,
the tears and prayers of women and children, being sufficient to persuade
remorse into these demidivells; in an instant you might have seen all that
good town in a confusion and uproare; the money, plate, pewter, brass, and
all things that were of worth or portable, being snapt up by their violence,
and all other household stuff which was not for it is weight or bigness fit to
be carried away, being spoiled and made useless; some you might have seen
cutting Bedsteads in pieces, some unripping the Beds, and casting abroad and
trampling on the feathers that the night before gave ease to their ungracious
bodies, diverse hewing Tables, and pulling down the very wanescot which they
cast into the Chimney, making that which before was an ornament to the room, a
fire to warm the naked walls: hangings which were not of much worth, running
the same destiny, those of Arras they packed up, intending to make sale of them
with the next opportunity; nor did their barbarous cruelty end here, the very
cattle in the stalls and adjoining yards, as Cowes, and the like, they
hough'd, or shot to death with their Carabines and Petronels: diverse of them in
their beastly and libidinous fury, offering violence to the honest Matrons and
beautiful Virgins, but therein they met stout resistance, diverse of the women
courageously resisting their attemps, and some sheathing their Knives and Spits
in the bowels of these miscreants, more savage then the Turks themselves: the
townsmen seeing all things go thus to ruin, their houses, goods and cattle,
nay, their wives and children undone before their faces, and of the trained
bands coming into them from the neighboring towns and Hamlets, began to pull
up their courages and resist the Cavaliers, who busy about their prey, had no
thought of being surprised or assaulted, but they had reckoned, it seems,
without their Hosts, who resolved to make them pay part of the reckoning with
their lives, falling therefore upon by parties in the several houses where
they were acting their villainies with Muskets, Pikes, Pitchforkes, and what
weapons they could possibly get, the Cavaliers amazed, and finding it no
business to be slighted, began to draw together into one body for the defense
of themselves and their unlawfull-gotten purchase of Money and Plate, leaving
all the rest, as Brass, Pewter, and the like; diverse also minding their prey
they were possessed of, more then the safty of their companions, got out to
their horses, and rid away as fast as they could; so that of a thousand of them
not above four hundred got together into the Marketplace, where the townsmen
and villagers with their Pikes and Muskets assaulted them so hotly, that they
tumbled above a score of them from their horses, their Commanders seeing the
service grow hot, and that the Country still came in upon them, were cautious
of staying any longer in that place, and therefore turned faces about, and
putting spurs to their horses, fled out of the town as fast they could, all
of them not scaping befitting punishment (if death can be a sufficient
punishment for such Monsters) for the men of the town following them as fast
as they could through the streets, discharged their Muskets with so good aim,
that they slew near fifty more; thus God in his great mercy delivered that
good town from the fury of those desperate Malignants, and turned their
mischief upon their own heads; the greatest damage the townsmen received,
being in the loss of their Money and Plate, which indeed was no great nor
considerable sum: the wealthy men of that town, ever since the arrival of
the Cavaliers into the parts thereabouts keeping no Plate at all, or very
little in their houses, and no more Money then what served for their domestique
expenses; so that the Cavaliers, considering the men they lost, had no great
reason to boast of their purchase. While these mischievous Malignants were
acting this cruel outrage at Alisbury, other birds of the same feather,
children of Belial, under the command of Count Robert, were performing the like
abominable outrages in and about the good town of Abington, where Prince
Robert coming with his Cavaliers, to a Gentleman's house of good quality and
much wealth, if I mistake not, the Gentleman was called Master Ashcombe,
plundered it without all mercy, using the good old Gentleman very despiteously,
taking away at least two thousand pounds in money, part of which, as it is
reported, Prince Robert restored back to the Gentleman's daughters, for
portions, perhaps that bounty being but the hand to some sinister ends he had
upon their chastities. From hence they came into the town of Abington, six
miles from Oxford and there billetted themseves, where they had most mind to
take up their lodgings, forcing their Landlords to provide them what dainties
their luxuries had most mind to, or that the town could yield them. The poor
townsmen willing to please them, as they of Alisbury* in hope their courtesy
might provoke them to courteous usage, had the same destiny which Alisbury had,
the next morning the greedy and insatiate Cavaliers, by the permission at
least, if not commission from their General, began their accustomed work of
plundring by degrees, that so the misery of the townsmen might the longer
last, taking from them at first only their Money all that they could possible
lay hands on, pretending that they wanted their pay from the King, who had no
Money, and that it was fit they should be satisfied of some body, none fitter
then they, who, as they termed them, were Malignants and Roundheads. The poor
townsmen being unable to make resistance, seemed willing enough to part with
their moneys, thinking they would not offer to deprive them of their goods; but
when they had rioted away their coin, losing one to another at Dice, then they
fell to rifling the houses, all the best furniture and ornaments, either of
Pewter, Brass, or the like being straight seized on by those that had
debauched away their money, and carried to Oxford, and there made sale of:
diverse of the townsmen stand to compound for their goods, giving them a
considerable sum of Money in lieu of them, which they took with a thousand
dammees, swearing not to meddle with them, but their money was no sooner spent
(and it always burned in their pockets bottomes, according to the Proverb)
but presently, not regarding their oaths and hideous protestations, fell
presently a rifling again, some of the owners ransoming their goods twice or
thrice from th^se thieves, at last were forced to part with them in spite of
their teeths; the Pewter, Brass, and such portable metal commodities being
all gone, they proceeded to other household stuff, as Beds and Curtains, rugs
and hangings, and the like: they made spoil also of Tables, Chayres and
Stools, not leaving any Inhabitant any thing of value in their houses but the
houses themselves, which if they could have made sale of or carried away, would
not have escaped their all-devouring fingers; so that the town of Abington is
in a most distressed estate, plundered by these insatiate Cavaliers, who like a
consuming fire destroy all before them wheresoever they come; being indeed, as
it was anciently said by the Italians of Attila and his Huns, the very scourges
of God for our offenses. Heaven deliver all good people from the hands of such
prodigies, and send them their deserved reward the Gallows, which, according
to the Proverb, groans for them, and then we should, no doubt, have a fair
accord between his Majesty and his high Court of Parliament, which God
preserve.

FINIS.
