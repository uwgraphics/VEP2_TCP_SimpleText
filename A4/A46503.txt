His Majesty's MOST GRACIOUS SPEECH To both Houses of PARLIAMENT, On Saturday
the 16th. of March, 1688.
My Lords and Gentlemen,
NOw I have the Occasion of coming hither to Pass this Bill, which I hope will
be for all Our Safeties, I shall put you in mind of one thing, which will
conduce much to Our Settlement, as a Settlement will to the Disappointment of
Our Enemies.

I am with all the Expedition I can, filling up the Vacancies that are in
Offices and Places of Trust by this late Revolution.

I know you are sensible there is a Necessity of some Law to Settle the Oaths
to be taken by all Persons to be Admitted to such Places; I Recommend it to
your Care, to make a speedy Provision for it: And as I doubt not, but you will
sufficiently Provide against Papists, so I hope you will leave Room for the
Admission of all Protestants that are willing and able to Serve.

This Conjunction in My Service will tend to the better Uniting you amongst
your Selves, and the Strengthening you against your common Adversaries.

FINIS.
