The Female Warrior.
Relating how a Woman in Man's attire, got an Ensigns place: and so continued
till the necessity of making use of a Midwife discovered her.

This valiant Amazon with courage filled,
For to Display her Colors was well skilled,
Till pregnant nature did her Sex discover,
She fell a pieces, and was made a Mother.
Tune of, I am a jovial Bachelor. With Allowance.


COme all you jovial buxome Girls
attend me here a while,
Here is a pleasant Story that
perhaps will make you smile:
It Is of a valiant Amazon,
whose Courage was most free,
To take up Arms, and march along
out of the North Country.
The Company to London came,
to quarter there a space,
And all the while this noble Girl,
supplied the Ensigns place:
And when that she did march along,
there is none did her suspect,
Although she lay upon the Guard,
and never did neglect.
Her mild behavior and sweet face,
much favor did her gain,
She acted nothing that was base,
whilst she did there remain:
But for the love of a dear friend,
disguised she would go:
To try her Fortune to the end,
against the daring Foe.
You know what strange effects this love
in many a one has wrought,
To dangers, and to perrils great,
it often has them brought;
But yet they valued not the same,
no more did this brave Lass,
Who though she was a jovial Dame,
did for an Ensign pass.


HEr colors bravely to display,
she often had the luck,
And was at push of Pike some say,
as good as ever struck:
To fold her Arms, and furl the Flag
she was expert and quick,
And never was a bungler found
at any pretty trick.
To play a game at Cards or Dice,
to pass the time away,
Or any Gentile exercise,
she never would say nay:
But for a Bottle of the best,
her little heart to cheer,
She smiling, often would protest
she loved it most dear.
When she amongst young gallants came,
she often was afraid,
Least in their wanton talk she should
by blushes be betrayed;
But custom made her at the length
so confident and free,
She did presume upon her strength,
she could not daunted be.
Unto the wars she was inclined,
being of courage bold,
And always bore a stately mind,
The scorned to be controlled.
When Mars and Venus conjuct were,
it is thought that she was born,
Which is an evidence most clear,
that some must wear the Horn.


Thus cunningly the time she past,
and none did her detect,
Until the Soldiers at the last
began for to suspect:
And by some certain signs in short,
they plainly did perceive
Their Ensign Metamorphosed,
and did them all deceive.
To make the case more evident,
and cause it to be known,
Her growing belly forced her
to lay the Colors down:
Unhappy chance it was alas,
and sore it did her vex,
Because that she, was found to be,
one of the Female Sex.
And now her groaning time being come,
A Midwife was prepared,
She could not march by beat of Drum,
nor mount the Court of Guard:
For why she did in pieces fall,
here one part, there another,
Did ever any know the like,
an Ensign made a Mother.
Thus have you heard, as I conceive,
a Story strange and true,
And verify I do believe,
the like you seldom knew:
Now all that ever can be said,
she was a jovial Lass,
(Had not her Belly, her betrayed)
as ever any was.
Printed for C. Pass^nger, at the sign of the Seven-Stars on London Bridge.
