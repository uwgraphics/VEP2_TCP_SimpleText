THE GROANS AND PANGUES OF TIBVRNE, To be delivered of her long expected
burden: That bloody, monstrous, cruel, and mischievous Parliament, now at
Westminster, dissembling with God, the King, the Country and City.

Sad is the time to all those who be
Actors and Friends to our iniquity;
Dismal and woeful are the time to those
Who join with Traitors, Rebels, and oppose
Their lawful King, the Prince, and Laws,
Death and shame take them their cause:
And now you standers by shall see
Them take their turns upon my tree;
In order have I set my house, and these
Which do their God, their King, the truth oppose,
Some in one place as their degree has been
Abettors and maintainers of this sin
Rebellion, Treason, Theft, and Blasphemy,
Gentle Spectators, rejoice to see them die.
Printed at the Mayors Banqueting house near Tyburne, in the year of the
Saints fear, 1648.

The groans and pangs of Tyburne, etc.
I Tyburne the ancient and metropolitan^ of all England, having a long time
weeped and mourned for my due, the Parliament, but now finding (by reason of
the Stars under which they sit) that their Glass is run, and their thread is
cut; I have put my house in order, and my self in mourning, to entertain my
long expected Guests, upon whom I do intend to bestow much cost at their
funeral; and for their security that I take care of them, let them but enquire
whether I have not provided great long pieces of horsedownes biscuit, which is
made of the best hemp those Confectioners could provide, many of them having
kept it by them this 7 years for my use, knowing well what a banquet I should
have need of when it pleased their Father Pluto to send them to me.

And now I shall give you a note of the names of all my attendants, and
Officers which are to wait upon me that day, and a brief description of their
abilities, and Offices in my Palace of Tyborne, or my City Court at
Tower Hill.

First I do appoint my new-come gallant Mr. upstart Skippon with his large
Legs porter at my hall door at Tyborne, because I know he can keep a door
very well for the cause, so long as they have money to make a key with, though
it be against his Lawful King, Country, and Conscience, and truly he is very
ingenious; that I do intend to send him (when my work and service is ended) to
Serberus to be his Deputy Jailer, to keep an accoumpt, and receive money of
all his old acquaintance and fellow Rebels here, which I am sure will not be
long after him, many of which will be so forward to overtake him that they will
take water and drown themselves rather then take my pass here at Tyborne
under my son Gregoryes hands: the man is of known fidelity to me ever since
he caused works to be made about me to destroy those which never must nor will
be mine, though he has plundered them of all they had; yet were they so honest
that for one Cavalier that came to me this seven years there has 20
Roundheads, and poor men I was glad to satisfy their stomachs, and stop their
hungers when he would not give them a penny of their pay which he received, but
sent their moneys to maintain his wife, and her Leaguer Lads in the
Low Countries: and truly my son Gregory has cause to thank my cozen Glyn
for sending him so many Parliament Saints to feast with me at several times,
upon whom they bestowed many good suites of clothes, with shirts which had been
Surpleses, and borrowed of Sir John the parish Priest, to keep the skin of
the Saints from woollen, besides Ladys smocks, aprons, and handkerchers, which
they borrowed without the consent of the owner, and translated them into bands,
cuffes, and boote-hose-tops, and if you will not believe me go and search his
wardrope.

Next I do appoint that well willer to murder, and son of Sedition and
treason John Warner Usher of my hall to walk before my guests at the funeral,
in his Gown of Crimson color, because I know he loves a garment dyed in blood
better then a white Surples, and since his employment will be great, I do
appoint him three Deputyes, men of his own temper and Religion, whose names I
shall give you, Foulkes, Wollaston, and Andrews, pretty men, serviceable, and
well seen in such employment, and because they may do it with more safety, I
do appoint all the braud headed Citizens (but especially those which have the
spirit, and can unfold the Scripture for three hours together) to attend upon
me that day with their mouths full of the spirit, their hearts full of
revelation, and their hands full of blood, to slat all opposers in the face
with either spirit, revelation or blood, that so Justice may be done on their
favors, as that she divine Mrs. Lamb, very methodically called them, when
she was in her two handed revelation at Dukes place, upon the first day of the
week, some three weeks since at a meal man's house.

Next I do appoint that justler of the Peace, who lives at the Bear by the
Bridge foot, the Yeoman of my Wineseller, whose drawing and spiritual
administration of it, will infuse such holiness into the cup, that if a Saul
be drunk with it, he may lie with his neighbors wife, or his own mayds, or
his own daughter, as Lot did with his, and commit no sin: and if a child
should chance to be begot by this means, it is no great matter, it is but a
babe of grace, and came of the seed of the faithful, and God sees no sin in
Israel, nor no transgression in Jacob, as was very spiritually held out by that
two handed preacher of the gospel Mr. Nonsense Kiffin, upon the Lords day in
Coleman street.

Next I do appoint my old seasoned son of sedition Col. Pride, to be Yeoman
of my beer seller; a man well seen in beer and ale if the Welsh do not
cheat me of his service, but I fear me if they do they will take him for
some Hog fed very high with grains, he smells so strongly on them; if he comes
home he will not be a grain too light for my son Gregory.

Next I do appoint that Butcher Rainsborow Yeoman of my pantry, because he was
always bred in a Scullery at Hull, or at Sea, and knows very well how to
cubberd up victuals very well, and now should the House but turn Cook as they
have been Butchers for this seven years, he would be sure to cheat the broken
bread and meat-men, of who the Houses in their little charity could afford the
poor prisoners; therefore I do not much care if I offer a challenge betwixt
Mariot of Grays-Inne and him, being both men of tall stomachs.

Next I do appoint that vessel of dreeping hogs head of tallow, that bundle
of grease, Whaley, to be the Yeoman of my scullery, for his wife and he very
well know how to sell and cry Kitchingstuffe, and truly it fears me you will
see him and his wife at their old trade again; the wife with a tub, and he
with a club or goad driving swine to the markets; but my son Gregory swears
hele whip him about the pig market ere long.

Next I do appoint that hell-hound of Pluto, that child of the Devil, that
bundle of Rebellion, that parcel of perfidiousnesse, that Canniball for
cruelty, Hammon, Steward of my house, who does not care to sell his God, poison
his King, devour Kingdoms, break trusts, disregard promises, and spit in the
face of a good conscience.

Next I do appoint John Brown and Henry Elsinge Clearks of my Kitchen, which
all the Kingdom knows are very well practiced in the rules of addition,
having studied it this seven years, being very confident they will keep
accounts as well to please me, as they have for the now diseased Parliament; I
am so well conceited on them, that had the Parliament but voted they themselves
had never been borne of a woman, they would have believed them, and set their
hands to it.

Next I do appoint that lump of lewdness, that scum of covetousness, that
list of a Tailor, whose yard was too short for his neighbors wife, Mrs. what
shall I call her, he knows who I mean, the Haberdashers wife on Snow hill;
you Mr. Coxe, you I say shall be Yeoman of my Roabes, being you have been my
son Gregory's chapman for many clothes shifted at my Palace at Tyburne,
before you were Treasurer of Haberdashers hall.

Next I do appoint my long Attendant Gregory my Cook, and do leave him to
his discretion to dress, lanch, carve, or set out head, bowels, heart, liver,
arms, shoulders, back, breast, loins, thighs, legs and feet, to be safe
powdered, pickled, stewed, roasted, sodden, broyled, or hanged up of all my
Parliament men, but especially of Manchester, Say, Wharton, Lenthall, Mildmay,
Corbet, Scot, Martin, Perpoint, Weaver, Eveling. Seldom; but for Haslerigge I
need make no great provision for or with him, since Jockey will provide him a
Cook in Edenburrough very shortly, will dress him up with Woodcock sauce; but
I pray thee have a care and see these well dressed that the Kingdom may say they
have not parted with their wealth and blood, but have seen something for it.

Next I do appoint that murder King, that impudent arch Traitor, that stall
bird Cobbler, that quintessence of hellishnes that child of perdition, that
son of Belial, that sinner against the holy Ghost, that Antitrinitarian,
Rolfe, who is mine without mercy, and the Devils decreed of old, before the
creation, and is to go to hell without bail or mainprize, to be my Messenger
to go betwixt hell and my hall to see how the Parliaments adherents do the
Devils work, and what store of them do intend repentance, and to carry
letters for the Devils in hell to all his dear sons upon earth, and when all
the Rebel Faction are either gone to the Devil, or repented and are gone to
God Almighty; I do assign him the labor of Sisiphus, the torment of
Tantalus, and no other comfort but what a wounded conscience can administer
unto such a wretch, nor no other company but the infernal spirits; who will
watch that black soul, which is more black then any soul which he put upon
shoe in his life?

Next I do appoint Patience, Kifen, Lamb, Goodwine, and Dell, my Chaplains
at ordinary to preach to all the congregation that belong to me, being very
sure that the whole Army is mine, and will come to me in spite of Loyalty and
true obedience: Therefore to confirm them the Devils and mine, I charge all
who belong to the Pope, the Devil, Antichrist, and me, to hear and practice
their doctrine, as they will answer it to me and my son Gregory; and for all
my Chaplains extraordinary, as Peeters, Love, Burges, Sedgwicke, and Case; I
hope they will not be backward in doing me duty, since they have such good
quarter already provided from them with my Cosen Pluto; and for Peeters he is
made Pims Chaplain, whenever he will but call to me for a pass, I have
promised my son Gregory shall set both his hands that he may go without let
or hinderance, and for Patience my Lord Brooks wants him, and is very angry
that his coach man does not come after him to hell, since he has a full
congregation of Parliament Saints there ready, and for Hambden and Stroud they
cannot choose but stand in need of them, I fear they cannot get an Independent
Priest in all their Country of hell; but I believe great Henderson of Scotland
serves them sometime with spunfuls of Presbytery, Burton and Burrowse being
really sworn Pluto's Chaplains cannot be spared from his Table.

Tyburnes speech to the standers by at the Funeral of the Parliament, as
follows.
GEntlemen,
I have a word or two to say to you standers by, by the way of admonition,
which is, that you take heed of false Prophets, who will lead you into blind
zeal, which when you are so, it is like mettle in a blind horse, you rush
upon all manner of sin as a horse does into the battle, not regarding what
sin you commit, and the Devil goes about like a roaring Lion, seeking whom
he may devour, and cares not which way he has you, so he have you by
hypocritical profession of Religion, as well as by drunkenness, swearing,
whoring, and Murdering; and I must say to you, the Devil does never more
deceive, then when he appears like an Angel of light: Take heed lest Religion
eat up your Loyalty as it has done all those which you are come to see
interred, it is many of the Priests have brought them to this. God the Son
commands to put up the sword when it was drawn in passion, and they command to
draw the word when there is neither Religion, Law, nor reason to defend them in
this their hellish designs; they are the Devils children whose work they do,
and now I admonish you to take warning by these. Rebel not against your God,
your King, your Country, upon any pretense whatsoever, lest ye likewise
perish, which the God of mercy keep you from, so prays Tyburne.

All you Loyal Subjects which do see
The ruins of Rebellion, treason, perjury,
Laugh, rejoice, praise God and sing,
When these are hanged, you will have your King
To govern you with Peace, plenty, joy,
When no Domesticke, neither foraigne Enemy
Shall hurt your selves, your Wife or barnes,
God will you keep from all such harms.
FINIS.
