FRIAR AND THE BOY.
THere dwelt a man in my Country,
Who in his life had wives three,
A blessing full of joy:
^y his first wife a child he had,
Which was a pretty sturdy Lad,
A good unhappy Boy.
^is father loved him very well,
But his stepmother never a deal;
I tell you as I think.
^ll things she thought lost, by the Rood,
Which might the boy do any good,
As either meat or drink.
and yet, I wis, it was but bad,
^or half enough thereof he had,
But ever more the worst,
and therefore evil might she fare,
That wrought the little boy such care,
So far-forth as she durst.
Into the man the wife began say,
^ would ye put this boy away,
And that right soon in haste:
Truly he is a wicked Lad,
^ would some other man him had
That would him better chaste.
Then said the good man: Dame, not so,
^ will not let the young boy go,
He Is but of tender age:
^e shall with me this year abide,
Till he be grown more strong and tried,
For to win better wage.
We have a man, a sturdy Lout,
Who keeps our Neat the fields about,
And sleeps all the day:
He shall bide home, as God me shield,
And Jack shall pass into the field,
To keep them, if he may.
^en said the wife: In veriment,
Husband, thereto I give consent.
For that I think it need,
On the morrow when it was day,
The little boy went on his way,
Toward the fields with speed:
Of no man took he any cure.
But sung, Hay ho, away the mure,
With mirth he did pursue.
Forward he drew with wight and main
Until he came amidst the plain,
And then his dinner drew.
But when he saw it was so bad,
Full little list thereto he had,
And put it up from sight,
Saying: He had no will to taste,
And that his hunger still should last,
Till he came home at night,
Now as the boy sat on an hill,
There came an old man him until,
Was walking by the way:
Who said: My son, now God thee see
Full welcome Father, may ye be,
The little boy did say.
The old man said: I hunger sore,
^ack, have thou any meat in store,
Which thou may give to me.
The boy replied: So God me save,
To such poor victuals as I have;
Right welcome you shall be.
Of this the old man was full glad,
The boy drew forth such as he had,
And said: Go to gladly.
The old man easy was to please,
He ate, and made himself at ease,
Saying, Son, gramercy:
And for the meat thou gave to me,
I will give three things unto thee,
what e're thou will entreat.
Then said the boy: The best I know,
That ye give to me a bow,
With which I birds may get,
A bow, my son, I shall thee give,
which shall last while thou do live,
Yea, never bow nor break:
^or if thou shoot therein all day,
Talking or winking any way,
The mark still shall thou hit.
^ow when the bow in hand he felt,
and had arrows under his belt,
He merry was, I wish:
and said: Had I a pype withal,
though never so little, nor so small,
I had all that I wish.
pype, Son, shall thou have also,
which in true Music so shall go,
I put thee out of doubt:
that whosoever shall it hear,
^hal have no power to forbear:
But laugh and leap about.
^ow tell me what the third shall be,
^or three things will I give to thee,
As I have said before.
^he boy then smiling, answer made
(...) have enough for my poor trade,
And will desire no more.
^he old man said: My troath is p^^ght,
^hou shall have all I thee be height:
Say on now, let me see.
At home I have, the boy replied,
^ cruel step-dame full of pride,
Who is most cursed to me:
When meat my father gives to me,
^he wishes poison it might be,
And stareth in my face.
^ow when she gazeth on me so,
(...) would she might a far^ let go,
That might ring through the place.
The old man answered then anon:
When that she looks thy face upon,
Her tail shall wynd the horn,
So lowdly, that who shall it hear,
^hal not be able to forbear,
But laugh her unto scorn.
^o farewell, son, the old man cried,
God keep you, Sir, the boy replied.
I take my leave of thee,
And he that best of all things may
Protect thee safe both night and day.
Gramercy, son said he:
When it drew near unto the night.
Jack well advised, hy'd home full right,
It was his ordinance;
And as he went his pype did blow,
The whilst his cattle on a row,
About him fast did dance.
Thus to the town h^pypsful trim
His skipping beasts do follow him,
Into his fathers close.
He went and put them up each one,
Then went into the house anon,
Into the hall he goes.
His father at his supper sat,
And little Jack espied well that,
And said to him anon:
Father, all day I kept your Neat,
At night, I pray you, give me meat,
I Am hungry, by Saint John.
Meatless I have been all the day,
And kept your beasts they did not stray
My dinner was but ill.
His father took a capons wing,
And at his son he did it fling,
Bidding him eat his fill.
This grieves his step-dames heart full sore
Who loathes the lad still more and more
And stares him in the face.
With that she let go such a blast,
As made the people all aghast,
And sounded through the place:
Each one did laugh and make good game;
But the cursed wife grew red for shame
And wished she had been gone.
Pardie, the boy said, well I wot.
That gun was well charged and shot,
And might have broken a stone.
Full curstly she looked on him tho,
And then another fart let go,
Which gart the thunder rise.
Quoth Jack Sir, did you never see,
A woman let her pellets flee,
More thick and more are ease:
Fie, said the boy unto his Dame,
Temper thy tell-tale lo^n for shame,
Which made her full of sorrow.
Dame, said the good maid, go thyway,
For why? I swear by night and day,
Thy gear is not to borrow.
Now afterward, as you shall hear,
Unto the house there came a Friar,
And lay there all the night:
This wife did love him as a Saint,
And to him made a great complaint,
Of Iack's most vile despice.
We have, quoth she, within, I wis,
A wicked boy, none shrewder is,
Which does me mighty care.
I dar not look upon his face.
Nor hardly show my shameful case,
So filthily I fare,
For my sake, meet him to morrow,
Beat him well, and give him sorrow
Yea, make him blind and lame.
The Friar swore, he would him beat,
She prayed him, not to forget,
The boy did her much shame.
He is a witch, quoth she, I smell.
But quoth the Friar, I Will beat him well
Of that take you no care,
I Will teach him witch craft, if I may.
O, quoth the wife, do so, I pray,
Lay on, and do not spare.
Early next morning the boy arose,
And to the field full soon he goes,
His cattle for to drive.
The Friar up as early gat,
He was afraid he came to late,
And ran full fast and blyth.
But when he came upon the land,
He found where little Jack did stand,
Keeping his beasts alone.
Now boy, he said, God give thee shame,
What have thou done to thy step da^^,
Tell me forthwith (...)
And if thou can no^ quite thee well
I Will beat thee till thy body swel,
I will no longer bide.
The boy replied: What aileth thee?
My step-dame is as well as ye,
What need you thus to chyde?
Sir, will you see mine arrows flee,
And hit yon small bird on the eye,
And other things withal.
Good Sir, if I have little wit,
Yet yonder bird I mean to hit,
And give her you I shall.
There sat a small bird on a brier.
Shoot, shoot, thou wag, then said the Friar,
For that fain would I see.
Jack hit the bird upon the head,
So right that she fell down for dead,
No further could she flee.
Fast to the bush the Friar then went,
And up the bird in hands he hint,
Much wondering at the chance.
Mean time Jack took his pipe and played
So loud, the Friar grew mad appay'd,
And began to skip and dance:
No sooner he the pipe sound heard;
But madman like he bound and fard,
Leaping the bush about.
The sharp briers scratcht him by the face,
And by the breech and other place,
That fast the blood ran out.
He tare his coat down the skirt,
His cap, his cool, his linen shirt,
And every other weed:
The thorns the while were rough a thick,
And did his privy member prick,
That fast they g^n to bleed.
Jack as he piped laugh^ among,
The Friar with b^^ers was vivel slung,
He hopped wondrous hie.
At last the Friar held up his hand,
And said I can no longer stand
Oh, I shall dancing die.
Gentle Jack thy pip^ (...)
And here I vow, for good not ill,
To do thee any woe.
Jack laughing to him this replied:
Friar, skip out at the other side,
Thou have free leave to go:
Out of the bush the Friar then went,
All marty'rd, ragged, scratcht and rent
And torn on every side:
Hardly on him was left a clout,
To wrap his belly round about,
His harlotry to hide,
The thorns had scracht him by the face
On hands and thighs, and every place
He was all bathed in blood:
So much that who the Friar did see,
For fear of him were fain to flee,
Thinking he had been wood.
When to the good-wife home he came
He made no brags for very shame,
To see his clothes rent all:
Much sorrow in his heart he had,
And every man did guess him mad,
When he was in the hall.
The good-wife said where have thou been,
Sure in some evil place I ween,
By sight of thine array.
Dame (said he) I came from thy son,
The devil and he has me undone,
No man him conquer may.
With that the good man he came in,
The wife set on her madding pl^
Cried here is foul array:
Thy son that is thy life and dear,
Has almost slain the holy Friar,
Alas and well away.
The good man said benedicite,
What has the vile boy done to thee,
Now tell me without let?
The devil take him, the Friar then said
He made me dance despite mine head
Among the thorns the hey go heat,
The good man said unto him tho,
Father had thou been murdered so,
It had been deadly sin.
The Friar to him made this reply
The pype did sound so merrily,
That I could never blin.
Now when it grew to almost night,
Jack the boy came home full right,
As he was wont to do
But when he came unto the hall,
Full soon his Father did him call,
And bid him come him to.
Boy he said, come let me hear,
What have thou done unto this Friar,
Lie not in any thing
Father he said, now by my birth,
I playde him but a fit of Mirth,
and pyped him a spring:
That pype said his father, I would hear,
Now God forbid cried out the Friar,
His hands then did he wring.
You shall the Boy said by Gods grace
The Friar replyde woe and alas,
Making his sorrows ring.
For Gods love said the wretched Friar,
And if ye will that strange pype hear,
Bind me fast to a post;
For sure my fortune this I read,
If dance I do, I am but dead,
My woeful life is lost.
Strong rops they took both sharp and round,
And to the post the friar they bound,
In the middle of the hall.
And they that at the table sat,
Laughed and made good sport thereat,
Saying, Friar thou can not fall.
Then said the good man to the Boy
Jack pype me up a merry toy,
Pype freely when thou will.
Father the Boy said verily,
You shall have mirth enough and glee
Till you bide me be still
With hat this pype h^ quickly hint.
And pyped whilst in vecament,
Each creature began to dance:
Lightly they skipt and leapt abo^t,
^earking there legs, now in now out
Striving aloft to prince,
The good man as in sad despair,
Leapt out, and through, and over his chair
No man could caper hier.
^ome others leapt quite over the stocks,
Some start at stra^^, and fell ore blocks,
Some wallowed in the fire.
The good man made himself good spor^,
To see the dance in this mad sort:
The good-wife sat not still,
But dancing still she looked on ^ack,
And fast her tail did double each crack,
Loud as a water mill,
The Friar this while was almost lost,
^e knocked his p^te against the post.
It was his dancing grace:
The rope rubde him under his chin,
That the blood ran from his ta^ed skin,
In many a naked place,
^ack pyping ran into the street
They followed him with nimble feet.
Having no power to stay
And in their haste the door did crak:
Each tumbling over his fellows back.
Unmindful of their way.
The neighbors that were dwelling by,
Hearing the pype so Merrily,
Came dancing to the gate.
Some leapt ore doors some o^^ the hatch
No man would stay to draw the larch
But though he earne to late:
Some sick or sleeping in their bed,
As they by chance lift up their head:
Were with the pype awaked,
Straight out they start through door and locks,
Some in their s^iers, some to their smo^
And some stark ^^lly (...).
When all were gathered round about,
There was a vile unruly rout:
That danced in the street,
Of which some lame and could not go,
Striving to leap did tumble so:
They daunst on hands and feet.
Jack ty'rd with sport, said now I Will rest,
Do, quoth his father, I hold it best,
Thou cloyst me with cheer.
I pray thee Boy thou quiet sit,
In truth this was the merriest fit,
I heard this seven year.
All these that dancing thither came,
Laughed heartily, and made good game
Yet some got many a fall,
Thou cursed Boy cried out the Friar,
Here I do summon thee appear,
Before the Official.
Look thou be there on fryda^ next,
I Will meet thee then though now perplexed,
For to ordain thy sorrow.
The Boy replied, I make a vow,
Friar I Will appear as soon as thou,
If friday were to morrow.
But friday came as you shall hear,
Iacks step-dame and the dancing Friar
Together they were met.
And other people a great pace,
Flock to the Court to hear each case.
The Official was set.
Much civil matters were to do,
More Libels read then one or two
Both against Priest and Clark.
Some there had testaments to prove,
Some women were through wanton love
Which got strokes in the dark.
Each Proctor there did plead his case
When forth did step Friar Tobias,
And Iacks step dame also:
Sir Official aloud said he
I have brought a wicked ^ad to thee,
Has done me mighty w^
He is a witch as I do fear,
In Orleance he can find no pe^r
This of my ruth I know,
He is a devil (quoth the wife)
And almost berav'd me of my life,
At that her tail did blow;
So loud, the assembly laughed thereat,
And said her pistols crack was flat,
The charge was all amiss.
Dame (quoth gentle Official)
Proceed and tell me forth thy tale,
And do no let for this:
The wife that feared another crak,
Stood mute and nere a word she spoke
Shame put her in such dread.
H^ (said the Friar) right angerly,
^ave this is all still long of thee,
Now evil mot thou speed;
The Friar said, Official,
This wicked Boy will vex us all
Unless you do him chaste;
S^r, he has yet a pype truly,
Will make you dance and leap ful^le
And break your heart at last.
The Offisial replied perdi^,
Such a pype I fain would see,
And what mirth it can make:
^ow God forbid replied the Friar
that ere we should that vile pipe hear
Ere I my way hence take:
^ypt on Jack said the Official,
and let me hear thy cunning all
Jack blew his pype full loud,
that every man start up and daunst,
^octors and Priests, and Sommors pranst,
And all in that great crowd:
Ever the dask the Official ran,
and hope upon the Table than,
Straight jumpt into the door.
^he Friar that daunst as fast as he,
^^t him midway dangerously,
Brake others face full sore;
(...) Register leapt from his pen,
And hopt into the throng of men,
His Irkhorn in his hand.
With swinging round about his head,
Some he struck blind, some almost dead
Some they could hardly stand:
The Proctors thing the bills about,
The good-wives tail gave many a shout
Perfuming all the mirth:
The Somoners as they had been wood,
Leap over the forms and seats a good,
And wallowed on the earth.
Wenches that for their penance came
And other ^eeds of worldly shame
Daunst every one as fast.
Each sat upon a merry ^in,
Some brok their heads and some their s^i^
And some their noses brast.
The Official thus sore turmoylde,
Half swelt with sweat almost spoild,
Cried to the wanto^ ^^ld
To pype no more within that place
But stay the sound even for Gods grace,
And love of Mary mild.
Jack said as you will it shall be,
Provided I may hence go free:
And no man do me wrong:
Neither this woman, nor this Friar
Nor any other creature here,
He answered him anon.
Jack I to thee my promise plight,
In thy defense I mean to fight,
And will oppose thy fond,
Jack cast his ^yp, then all still stood,
Some laughing into, some raging wood,
So p^rted at that tide.
The Official and the Somner,
The step-dame and the wicked Friar;
With much Joy mirth and pride,
FINIS.
