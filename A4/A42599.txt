The General ASSOCIATION, Of the Gentlemen of Devon, to his Highness THE Prince
of Orange.
We whose Names are here unto Subscribed, who have now joined with the Prince
of Orange, for the Defense of the Protestant Religion; and for maintaining the
Ancient Government, Laws and Liberties of England, Scotland, and Ireland; do
engage in Almighty God, to his Highness the Prince of Orange; and to one
another, to stick firm to this Cause, and to one another, in the Defense of it;
and never to depart from it, until our Religion, Laws and Liberties, are so far
secured to us, in our Free Parliament; that we shall be no more in danger of
falling under Popery and Slavery: And as we are Engaged in this common Cause,
under the Protection of the Prince of Orange; by which means his Person may be
Exposed to Dangers, and Desperate, and Cursed Attempts of Papists, and other
Bloody Men; we do therefore solemnly Engage both to God and one another; that
if any such Attempts are made upon him, we will pursue not only those who make
them, but all their Adherents, and all that we find in Arms against us, with
the utmost Severity, of a just Revenge to their Ruin and Destruction; and that
Execution of such Attempts, which God of his Mercy forbid; shall not prevent us
from Prosecuting this Cause, which we now under take, but that it shall engage
us to carry it on, with all the vigor that so Barbarous a Practice shall
deserve.
