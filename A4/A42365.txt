The Longing Shepherdess: OR, LADY lie near me.
To the Tune of, Lady lie near me, Or, the green garter.


ALL in the Month of May,
when all things blossom,
As in my bed I lay
sleep it grew loathsome:
Up I rose and did walk
over yon Mountains,
Through Mountains and through Dales
over Rocks and Fountains,
I heard a voice to say
Sweetheart come cheer me,
Thou have been long away
Lady lie near me.
Down by yon River side
and surgins billows,
A pleasant Grove I spide
well set with willows;
In it a Shepherdess
singing most clearly,
And still her note it was,
Lady lie near me.
Come away do not stay, etc.
Sweetheart thou stayst too lon^
Phoebus is watching,
Aurora with her steed,
is fast approaching:
She does her chariot mount
which much do fear me,
Each hour a year I count
till you lie near me:
Come away do not stay
sweetheart and cheer me,
Thou have been long away
Lady lie near me.
Hymen keeps holy day
Love take thy pleasure,
Cupid has thrown away
his Bow and Quiver;
Boreas does gently blow
least I should fear him,
Yet dare I not to stay
alone to hear him.
Come away, etc.


DId not Adonis like
sweetheart fly from me
For careful I will be
as does become me,
Both of my flock and thine
whilst they are feeding
Dear is my love to thee
as is exceeding.
Come away, etc.
I may sing welladay
my joys are ended,
The hour of my approach
is almost spended:
My Parents will me miss,
and Swains will ieer me,
Thus still her note it was,
Lady lie near me:
Come away, etc.
She had no sooner spoke
but her true Lover,
Near to her did approach
her grief to smother:
Hearing thy moan my sweet,
I came to cheer thee,
And will before I part,
dearest lie near me:
Be not sad, I am glad
that I did hear thee,
And what as can be had
thouse have to cheer thee.
No cost that I will spare,
for to content thee,
Iunkets the best that are,
they shall be sent thee:
The chiefest I can get,
and best Canary,
Then do not sweetheart sit
so solitary.
Be not sad, etc.
I hate to bear the mind
of a base peasant,
Thou still shall find me kind
Partridge and Phesant,
Butchers meat is but gross
fair that is dainty,
For thee my loving Lass
we will have plenty,
Be not sad, etc.
Adonis like to prove
that were so cruel,
To one so dear I love
the richest jewel;
I do not estimate
like thee my sweeting,
I in my heart will hate
for to be fleeting.
Be not sad, etc.
The time we will pass away,
Histories reading,
Whilst our flock day by day,
gently are feeding:
And on my Oaten-Reed
Love to requite thee,
Care away I will play
for to delight thee.
Be not sad, etc.
The birds with their sweet notes
cheerfully singing,
Also will thee delight,
contentment bringing:
Whose pleasant Harmony
from them resounding,
Still will delightful be,
most sweetly sounding.
Be not sad, etc.
Though I my self am absent,
and sometimes leave thee,
To work thy discontent
let nothing grieve thee,
But merry be sweetheart
till my returning.
Alone my dear thou art
then cease thy mourning;
For I will still be kind
always to cheer thee.
And so to cease thy mind,
I will be near thee.
