A short general Judgment upon this Nativity. The first House.
AT the Birth of this great and victorious Prince, the second Decanale of
ascends the Horoscope, and Lord thereof in in to in: and, who is in Reception
with Lord of the Horoscope, is in to the, and in a Regal commanding Sign; this
gives him a great undertaking Spirit, desirous to do great things, as well by
Peace as War.

ascends which is cold, and inclining to Melancholy, the Sun is in an earthy
melancholy Sign; and the Moon, who is a general Significator of the actions of
a man's life, is in to and to; Lord of the Horoscope is in a fiery chollerick
Sign, in to in a melancholy Sign: Hence his temperature is generally
Chollerick-Melancholly, Choler being the Parent of Passion and Patron of
Courage, and Melancholy the Author of study, gravity, and discretion.

ascending and in gives him something more than a middle stature, fat and
fleshy, which is the more increased by the aspect to, and he being also in so
great a Reception with Mars, all his Significators strong, and in active parts
of Heaven, gives a strong able body, not easily tired, especially in the
hardship of War.

Of the Qualities of the Mind.
BY the Qualities of the Mind I mean the effluviums of the sensitive Appetite
and rational Soul, from the first of which are produced those two natural
Principles of Lust and Anger, Love and Hate, and all other sensible Effects of
the sensitive Appetite, to which is joined the Rational Soul, the very ipsa
hominis forma Informans, by which we are distinguished from bruits, and is
thought by some to have an intrinsic Plastic virtue to nourish the Embrio in
the Womb.

From this rational Soul proceeds two Properties; first the Intellect, which is
the eye of the soul, and has the senses for its Organs, according to the old
Adage, nihil intellectu quod non prius fuit in sensu: but it differs from the
senses in this; the sense is employed about materials and singulars, the other
about immaterials and universals; all the species of things it reserves to it
self, and that is called memory, whose twin-brother is judgment, which is
either speculative or practical: the first considers things as they are things,
the other as they are good or evil. Secondly, the Will, which is neither merely
passive nor merely active, but is agitated either by Object or Thought; and it
has also a kind of a blind power, for it desires nothing unless it be proposed
to it by the Intellect; hence that saying; Ignoti nulla cupido. The Operations
and Essluviums of this sensitive and rational Soul, with its Faculties and
Properties, is called in English the Mind, and is a perfect Comprisal of the
whole Man, or rather the thesaurus animae, collecting beams and rays from all
parts of the sense and soul, and does either improve them by Virtue, or
mis-improve them by Vice, according to the Position of the Luminaries with the
benefick or malesick Stars in the Radix or Nativity, and is our next business
to consider.

Mercury in in to gives him a sharp piercing understanding, yet something rash
sometimes in his undertakings; it inclines him to all manner of practical
ingenuity and politic designs, especially in War: the Sun casting a to his
Horoscope, makes him perform all his Actions with Greatness and Princely Glory,
suitable to the Qualities of his Birth; the in Conjunction with, and the within
orbs of the of, affords him diverse admirable Qualifications, and so lofty a
spirit, that he scorns to trample upon a Conquered Enemy.

Of the Giver of Life.
THE Sun must be admitted Giver of Life in this Nativity, as being in the only
Aphetical place proper to him, the Birth being Diurnal, and Mercury by the same
Rule must be the Alchocodon, or Giver of Years, which in this Nativity and
Natives life will be about forty eight: though he will live longer, as you may
read hereafter.

The second House.
JVpiter Lord of the second, in so forcible a Reception with Mars in the
second, is able of it self to give the Native a most admirable Fortune; but
besides this, he has the ^ in Conjunction with, and both casting their to the
part of Fortune, and the Sun in the tenth in to, all which are great Arguments
of advancement in Riches; and as Mars the Lord of the Ascendant is in the
second, so it shows the Native shall procure it by his own endeavor; yet as
the Moon is in to and of, and Saturn also in square to, and in to in the
second, so he will have at some times occasion to be sensible of the want of
Money, though his Birth has provided him security from the long continuance of
such a want.

Of the third House.
SAturn in the third House, and Lord of the same also, shows the Native has
not many Brethren and Sisters, however Saturn may show a Brother or two, he
being strong there in a Masculine Sign, and he a Masculine Planet; but for
Sisters I cannot judge any.

Of the Fourth House.
SAturn, Lord of the Fourth House, must be the signification of the Natives
Fathers, who being in to and to the and, shows the troubles that he under-went
both public and private, in Body and Mind, so long before he dyed, which was
in April, 1643. Saturn in to from fixed signs, may very well denote long
Chronical Diseases, and the of Lady of the Eighth from the Fourth, shows the
expiration thereby; the truth is, he dyed after he had lingered five years under
those misfortunes, according to this distance of Saturn from the to the Moon
and Venus.

Of the Fifth House.
THis House takes notice of the Native; Children in Marriage; and they are
personated by Aries upon the Fifth, and Mars Lord thereof in in Reception with
Jupiter in, a fruitful sign, which shows the possibility of his having
Children; yet because Venus, the Lady of the Eleventh, the Fifth from the
Seventh, and the Moon are in Leo, a barren Sign, and both in square to Jupiter,
and opposition to Saturn, so it shows him to have but few, and of those some
shall dye also, because Mars, Lord of the fifth, is in to Lord of the fourth
from the fifth, and Venus, Lady of the fifth from the seventh, is in to Saturn.

The Judgment belonging to the Sixth house.
MArs Lord of the sixth House, in a fiery sign in square to Mercury, who is
strong in, seems to threaten him with hot Chollerick Distempers, which tend to
a Frenzy, a Delirium, or depravation of sense: but these Diseases will be of
no long continuance, because Mars and Mercury are both in common Signs, and in
good Houses of Heaven: But what Diseases come from the Moon and Saturn will be
durable and hard to be cured, and such are the Stone, Gravel in the Kidneys,
crude Humors, and perhaps the Gout; and these will happen under bad
Directions, and bad Revolutions, etc. But Mars Lord of the Ascendant strong,
and the Ascendant it self free from all malignant Rays, will give him a strong
vigorous body, by which means he will baffle Diseases by strength, exercise and
courage, until age and ill Directions impair Nature, which will happen before
he expires, and not long neither, according to Bonal. 755. at si planeta qui
habet significare Infirmitates fuerit occidentalis, erunt in ultima medietate
vitae ejus, that if the Planet which signifies Diseases were Occidental, they
shall happen in the last part of his life.

The Judgment belonging to the Seventh House.
WHen I considered Venus Lady of the seventh in Conjunction with the Moon in
Leo, a barren Sign, in to who always forbids Marriage, and in a barren Sign in
to Lord of the Ascendant, I did wonder that this Native should marry so soon,
and with so little difficulty as he did: yet when I observed Jupiter in a
fruitful Sign, in reception with Mars Lord of the Horoscope, and in Aspect with
the Moon and although a square, it was a rational argument for the soon
performance of this matter; and the Moon also who has Dignities in the seventh
is in Conjunction with Venus Lady of the same, and a general significator of
Marriage also; hence this is sufficient to prove that he should marry once, and
that early too: according to the falling of those marrying Directions, the
truth is, this Native did marry Maria Tiresia d' Austria, the Infanta of Spain,
in the year 1660.

The Natives Enemies are signified by Venus in Conjunction with the Moon near
the praesepe and Aselli, in Opposition of Saturn and to Jupiter, and therefore
for his public Enemies abroad, the Opposition of infatuates them, and
possesses them with many and strange fears, so that they are but like a Lamb
in a Lions skin, having the Name, but not the real Nature of Enemies.

Of the Judgment of the Eighth House.
I Shall omit to Elect the Lord of death Cabalistically, and endeavor to
satisfy my Reader with this, that when the Moon comes to the Body of and
square of Mars, that is about 1681, or 1682, ut videas, he will be in danger of
Poison and Treachery; but because his Alchocoden does not so soon expire, I am
of the opinion he will live gloriously till the Sun, who is Hilea or Giver of
life, comes by direction to the square of Saturn in Libra, at which time he
will have many troubles; and that will be when he is fifty years complete, and
two hundred and seventeen days, when it begins to work; and at that time he
has upon his Radical Horoscope, and Mars upon the Radical place of the Moon,
which will be about March and April in the year 1689, and also threaten some
danger to his life.

That his death will be attended with violence, seems to appear from Mars in a
violent Sign in square to Mercury, Lord of the eighth, and to the Sun also
applying; and the Moon according to her Longitude is with violent Stars in
Opposition to Saturn; and lastly, the Moon and Jupiter in square from violent
parts of Heaven, and therefore God preserve this great Prince from poison,
falls, or wounds.

Of the Ninth House.
IT will be needless to take notice of the Religion of this Illustrious Prince,
but leave that as an exercise to the internal actions of Faith.

The Judgment proper to the Tenth House.
MArs Lord of the Ascendant in a Regal Sign, in Reception with Jupiter, gives
him a Spirit inspired with a desire of Greatness and Glory, to which we may add
the in Conjunction with Venus in a Regal fiery Sign; and Lord of the tenth
partly, in square with Mars, will make him studious about the advancement of
his Honor, and stirs up and excites his Intellectuals to contrive and project
the same.

But above all is the Sun in the tenth, which gives wonderful and durable
Honor, Sol in dome decima faelix: magnam potestatem etiam in juventute
significat, Origa. de Effec. fol. 699 that the Sun well placed in the tenth
House gives great power, especially in the younger years; to which we may add
the Sextile of Jupiter to the Sun, and to the Cusp of the MC almost, with the
Cor Leonis a Regal fixed Star Culminant, all which are great arguments of
honor and splendor, and that this honor will not be momentany and decaying,
but durable, even to his life's end.

The Judgment belonging to the Eleventh House.
SPica in the Eleventh and the also, gives him rich and powerful Friends. Venus
Lady of the Eleventh in Leo with the Moon shows them to be honorable active
persons, having as great Spirits as himself; yet Venus in Opposition of Saturn,
and square to makes them unable to serve him according to their desires, and
that there shall distastes happen, although not designed: and as Mars Lord of
the Ascendant is in square to Mercury upon the Cusp of the eleventh, so the
Native will be suspicious enough of such Friends.

Judgment belonging to the Twelfth House.
THE twelfth House gives Judgment of private Enemies, and Captivity, both which
the Native is exempted from by the force of Starry Influence; for Venus Lady of
the twelfth House is afflicted by the Opposition of Saturn and Jupiter, and
Jupiter in the twelfth is afflicted by them both, so that the Natives private
Enemies shall be afraid to trust each other in Confederacy, and there is no
injury so dangerous as a confederated design is: -- yet here the Reader must
understand, that this Judgment is meant only in his life, for at his death he
is likely to suffer by treachery, and the cruel designs of unjust men: and yet
I mention this not evasively, with a reservation, that whenever he dies it is
fulfilled, but that it will take place only at the time mentioned, that is, at
the Age of 42, or 49, or both.

Thus we may see the ineffable wisdom of a Deity, in disposing all into a
regular course of Nature, all things agreeing in order to the main design for
which they were appointed; and also the great Treasury of nature how it
combines and contrives the Transactions of our lives, as to Time, Quality, and
Effects, therefore it is not Antichristianism nor Atheism, to own and believe a
regular Fate, [for it is indeed (...) divinitus decretum, so called from (...)
divido, quia suum cuique divisum est,] all things acting and working having
respect to their central cause; to which purpose one learnedly says, Centrum
unum omnium deus est. And immediately after he tells us, that there are four
Circles continually rolling about it, i. e. the Mind, the Soul, nature and
matter. Hence you see the Intellectuals give their attendance to that great
Being, in order to the performance of their duty in nature; and by how much the
more glorious the mind of man is, than his body, so is the mind of Angels more
glorious than they, and is indeed the perfect Rays of a Deity; and Marsilius
Ficinus, after a long discourse in his Commentary upon Plato de Convivio,
speaking of the qualification of the mind, and how the passions of some are
communicated to some, he makes use of no other cause but starry Influence, when
he says, ita ut si nascente aliquo Mars in Veneris domo, Libra vel tauro
fuerit; propter Martis praesentiam qui tunc Natus est, acerrimis uritur
amoribus, orat. quinta. cap. 8. In the Nativity of any one, if Mars should be
in either of the Houses of Venus, i. e. Libra or Taurus, because of Mars his
presence, he that is then born will be subject to the torments of Love, which
in some Nativities I have taken notice of, especially when the is in good
Aspect of Venus: and indeed it would not be hard to prove, or yet to believe
Saturn, Mars and Venus to be the only Authors of all the Witchcraft in the
World; yet not according to the Popular Opinion by fascination, but by a
Magnetical Sympathy and Antipathy in the Actives and Passives of nature: So
they are also the cause of depraved minds and vicious Actions, and that with a
witness, if the picture of the Soul is not in good aspect with the Moon and
Saturn, by which means Reason gains the Conquest of Lust and Passion -- but of
this enough --

Some few remarkable Revolutions belonging to this Nativity.
AND first, of the Revolution for the Suns return, Anno 1671. to his radical
place, under the Influence of which he performed those great Undertakings
against Flanders and Germany.



This Revolution is as prodigious as the Effects, which were the then actions
at that time of this Great Prince, for here the Figure is almost the same with
that of the Radix, and all the Planets above the Earth (except Saturn) and he
is as strong as any of them, being angular and in Reception with: here is the
Sun gloriously placed in the Tenth House with Mercury in his Dignities, and the
Moon and Venus in the Eleventh in Libra, and Mars Lord of the Ascendant in
Conjunction with Jupiter near the Cusp of the Tenth House; and it is such a
Position as is not commonly seen: I shall forbear to enlarge upon the Effects
of this Figure, because the actions are so long past: and therefore let those
that understand it draw a Judgment for their own use, I will proceed to the
Figure of the Revolution, pro Anno 1678.



^ The Moon in Taurus, her Exaltation in trine to the Sun in the Ascendant, and
Mars who has Dignities in the Fifth, in Sextile to the Sun there, and in Trine
to Jupiter Lord of the Seventh, show great inclination to a pacification, and a
general peace; yet Lord of the Horoscope in to Jupiter, shows some impediment
and hindrance in those Affairs, but in the end it will be perfectly effected:
and so I come to the Revolution for the year 1680.



This is the Revolution to operate with the Moon to the body of Mercury without
Latitude, but the Figure being no ways violent, I shall forbear all further
mention hereof; and proceed to the Revolution for 1681.



This is like to be an unhappy Revolution, to work with so ill a Direction; for
here is Lord of his Radical Horoscope in square to Saturn, and Lord of this
Horoscope is combust, and both in to the Moon, and besides Saturn is upon the
Radical place of the Moon, and Mars upon his Radical Horoscope in square to
him, hence it is like to prove an ill Revolution, but yet not mortal, although
he will be in danger this year: And so I come to consider his Revolution for
the Fiftieth year of his age, beginning 1688. from Argol's Ephem.

MC ad dom. 12.

These are the Directions that will influence the Fate of this Revolution,
which I am of opinion will not prove fatal, and that for these Reasons: First
Saturn is Lord of no malignant House: and secondly, his square falls within the
Rays of Jupiter, and he strong: Thirdly, the is within the good Beams of Venus,
that is her just coming up: Hence I am induced to believe, that Saturn has not
force and ill will enough to kill at this time. But in the Revolutional Figure
I confess that, Lord of the Radical Horoscope, and partly of this, is combust
in the Eighth House; and the Sun, who is Fons Vitae, is also afflicted of Mars
in the same House; but the is in Conjunction with, and hastening to a of Venus
and the Sun; yet as the Moon is in Conjunction with in the Twelfth House, and
they both weak in a Melancholy Sign, and the Sun, Mars, and Venus are
afflicted in the Eighth in an earthy Sign, so he shall be subject to
Melancholy Distempers, passions, and discontents; yet as the Lord of the
Horoscope is in exaltation, he will indubitably survive all; for although the
of Saturn is a malignant direction, yet according to that Aphorism of Hermes,
his malignity is meliorated by the good Beams of Jupiter, which is able to
save, although he were Lord of the Eighth House: solvit Saturnum, and solvit
Martem, Herm. Apho. 27. And Argol speaking of the Moon in a Revolution, says,
Venus and Jupiter juncti cum Luna corporis sanitatem demonstrant, Pto. Par.
fol. 194. Jupiter and Venus joined to the Moon show health and soundness of
body. And that those Planets afflicted in the Eighth House does rather show
some vexation and trouble to happen to the Native about his Conquest in
Flanders, or his Children, or his Wifes Dowry, or perhaps all; and not to touch
his life, as some I am sure would judge from such a Position and Direction: and
this is the rather confirmed to me, because is strong in the Seventh, he the
only Planet angular and in Reception with the Sun.

But perhaps some may say he has a bad profectional Figure for this year, he
now having in his Horoscope (and therefore the Radical place of) and the
Radical place of culminant, in his Medium Coeli, which I own to be an unhappy
Position, and to carry a sufficient tendency of ill, were there other sequel
Causes for the same; but Profections are rather Demonstrations of the Effects
of Directions, than particular Causes of any such things themselves; but I
leave those things to those who are more curious.

I do think this Native may in a course of Nature live till the Sun, who is
Giver of life, comes to the of Venus, who is Lady of the seventh House in the
Radix and to the square of the Moon, who has Dignities in that House also, and
at the same time the Ascendant comes to the square of Mercury, Lord of his
Eighth House, and to the body of Mars also, without latitude, as may be seen by
the Table of Directions preceding; and this will happen about the fifty fourth
or fifty fifth year of his age. And thus much for this Nativity.

Nihil sine fine.
AN APPENDIX.
BY way of Appendix I will here add the Nativity of that Illustrious Prince
Lewis the Daulphin of France, eldest Son to Lewis the Fourteenth, the present
King of France.

This Valiant young Prince was born at Fountainblean, November the first, S. N.
but October the twenty second, S. V. Min. 9. P. M. 1661. to which time the
right Ascension of the Sun is, Rect. Ascen. 217 4 Tempor. 2 15 Rect. Ascen. MC.
219 19 ad 90 Ascen. Obli. Ascen. 309 19

The Figure without further Operation is as follows, to the Latitude of 49
Degrees, the Planets places not being reduced, but taken from Vincent Wing
without Reduction.



LATITUDO PLANETARUM.
1 52 N. 1 6 N. 1 25 N. 1 9 So. 0 32 So. 3 7 N.

This young Prince having had so few Accidents, that we have not many to prove
the Nativity by; and therefore the main accident that I do principally trust
to, is the Horoscope to the square of Jupiter in Capricorn, a place which
Jupiter perfectly hates: and about the same time the Sun to the body of Saturn
in Scorpio, which Directions may very well suit to the-Accident of 1678, which
was a Quartan Ague, at which time the Worshipful Sir Robert Talbot, Knight, and
Doctor of Physic, was sent for by his Majesty of France to cure him, which he
accordingly did immediately after his arrival there: how these Directions suit
to the time, you may observe by the following Operations.

Ascen. Obli. Ascend. 309 19 Ascen. Obli. 325 45 Directio quaesita. 16 26
Descen. Obli. 216 1 Descen. Obli. CL. 232 54 Arcus directi. 16 53

There have been more Directions in force, but because I cannot be so happy as
to hear of the Accident attending them, I shall forbear their Operations, and
give the Reader an account when they happened, that others when they know them
may apply them to their proper Causes and Effects; aged about seven years, he
had the Sun directed to the body of Mercury, which Direction could not choose
but be dangerous to his life.

Aged about 12 or 13, he had his Horoscope to the of Mars cum Lat. this could
give no durable disease, because it was within the Rays of the of Saturn, and
and were in at his birth, yet it would give some slight Fever, etc.

But when he shall be aged 21 years, his Sun comes by Direction to the square
of the Moon in Sagitary; this will be a dangerous Direction, and will give
either the small Pox, or a Fever, or both.

Aged near 25, his Horoscope comes to the of the Sun in, a place the Sun hates,
this is usually a troublesome dangerous direction, and does as well concern the
honor as the life of the Native, and his Father.

But seeing Directions work according to the Quality of the persons passive in
their Effects, and because I am not sure that this Horoscope is certainly true
(although I dare be confident it is not far off from the true one) I will omit
all other particulars of this nature, and come to speak to things more general.

In this Nativity the Sun is Giver of Life, and Mars Giver of Years, from
whence we may judge that this Native may live to a considerable age: and as
Mars casts his Trine to Saturn, Lord of the Ascendant, and the Sun casts
his to the Degree ascending, he may be generally very healthful; to which we
may add the of the Sun and Moon, Saturn, Lord of his second, in to Mars in the
seventh, and the Sun, Lord of the eighth, in Trine to the Moon in the second,
and who has Dignities in the eighth, is likewise in the tenth House, show him
to advance his Fortune by Marriage, and that he may probably marry thrice, if
not four times, because the Moon, Lady of the seventh, is in, the Dignities of
Venus a fruitful Sign, and in the seventh in, a fruitful Sign, and the Sun and
Saturn Lord of the Ascendant in in the tenth House, the prime angle of the
Figure, and a fruitful Sign also. It is generally reported, that this Native is
of a very morose nature, which is well signified by, who has Dignities in the
Horoscope in to, the Author of Clemency and good Nature, and the Moon in to
Saturn, Lord of the Ascendant, may very aptly signify the same, especially if
we consider the fixed Stars that the Sun is with, and the general significator
of the mind is with the like fixed Stars, and combust of the Sun, and in Aspect
neither to nor.

That his death will be natural, is visible by the Moons to the Sun and, and
his to Lord of the Ascendant, and that he will dye of a Dropsical or a
Hypochondriacal Distemper, because Lord of the sixth and eighth is in Scorpio
combust, and Saturn Lord of the Ascendant, and the Moon in watery Signs.

The Sun in the tenth shows he will be famous and honorable at sometimes, and
that in his own Country too, for his Conquests will not be eminent abroad,
although he will have an aspiring undertaking spirit, and aiming at great
things.

But Saturn in the tenth (although Lord of the Horoscope) in to the Moon in the
second, will in the latter part of his life give him some unhappy Accident and
Catastrophe to his Honor; and this is confirmed by Lord of the tenth in the
seventh, in to in the ninth: why may not the Clergy oppose his honor and
greatness, or some Religious War begin again in France, for Venus Lady of the
ninth is in Reception with, and he his real Enemy.

POSTSCRIPT.
WHereas in Page the 20th, line the 14th, there is mention made of 42 or 49,
this is to advertise those Readers who do not understand Astrology, that it is
expressed there after the method of writing in the Speculum of Directions, which
is in complete years, so that the Effects of the Moon to the Body of Mercury
and square of Mars, will continue in force from the beginning of 1681 to the
beginning of 1683. and the other Direction, that is of the Sun to Saturn, is
mentioned 49, the Reason is, because it is the complete number of Degrees
between the Significator and the Promittor, but being turned into time, shows
it will not appear in Effect before he is fifty years and a half old -- but let
him get well over the two former Directions, I fear he will find them dangerous
enough. God preserve him from poison, and the treachery of a near Kinsman of
his own Name, in 1682. -- This I thought good to acquaint the Reader with, to
prevent mistakes and clamours against the Author.
