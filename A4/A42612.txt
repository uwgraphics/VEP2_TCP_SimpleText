A General sale of Rebellious Household Stuff.
To the Tune of, Old Simon the King.
REbellion has broken up House,
and has left me old lumbar to sell,
Come hither and take your choice,
I Will promise to use you well.
Will you buy the Old Speakers Chair,
which is warm and easy to sit in,
And oftentimes has been made clean
when as it was fouler than fitting.
Says old Simon the King,
says old Simon the King,
With his threadbare clothes, and his mamsey nose,
sing hey ding, ding, a ding, ding.
Will you buy any Bacon-Flitches,
they are the fattest that ever was spent,
They Are the sides of the old Committees
fed up with the long Parliament.
Here Is a pair of Bellows and Tongs,
and for a small Matter I Will sell 'em,
They Are made of the Presbyters Lungs,
to blow up the Coals of Rebellion.
Says old etc.
I had thought to have given them once
to some Blacksmith for his Forge,
But now I have considered on it,
they are consecrated to the Church:
For i will give them to some Choir,
to make the Organs to roar,
And the little Pipes squeak higher
than ever they did before.
Says old etc.
Here Is a couple of Stools for sale,
the one square, and the other is round,
Betwixt them both the Tail
of the RUMP fell unto the ground,
Will you buy the States-Council-table,
which was made of the good Wain- Scot,
The Frame was a tottering Babble,
to uphold the Independent Plot,
Says old etc.
Here Is the Beesom of Reformation,
which should have made clean the floor
But it swept the wealth out of the Nation,
and left us Dirt good store.
Will you buy the States spinning-wheel,
which spun for the Ropers trade?
But better it had stood still,
for now it has spun a fair thread.
says old etc.
Here Is a very good Clyster-Pipe,
which was made of a Butchers stump,
And oft-times it has been used
to cure the Colds of the RUMP.
Here Is a Lump of Pilgrim-Salve,
which once was a Justice of Peace,
Who Nol and the Devil did serve,
but now it is come to this.
says old etc.
Here Is a Roll of States Tobacco,
if any good fellow will take it,
Its neither Virginia nor spanish,
but I Will tell you how they do make it:
It Is Covenant mixed with Engagement,
with an Abjuration Oath;
And many of those that do take it,
complain it is foul in the Mouth.
says old etc.
Yet the Ashes may Happily serve
to cure the scab of the Nation,
When they have an Itch to serve
Rebellion by Innovation.
A Lanthorn here is to be bought,
the like was scarce e're begotten.
For many a Plot't has found out
before they ever were thought on.
says old etc.
Will you buy the RUMP's great saddle,
which once did carry the Nation,
And Here Is the Bit and the Bridle,
and Curb of Dissimulation,
Here Is the Breeches of the RUMP,
with a fair dissembling Cloak,
And a Presbyterian Jump,
and an Independent smock.
says old etc.
Here Is Olivers Brewing Vessels,
and here is his Dray and his Slings;
Here Is Hewsons Aul and his Bristles,
with diverse other odd things.
And what does the price belong
to all these Matters before ye,
I Will sell them all for an old song,
and so I do end my story.
Says old Simon the King,
says old Simon the King,
With his threadbare clothes and his mamsey Nose,
sing hey ding, ding, a ding, ding.
London, Printed for Allen Banks, 1688.
