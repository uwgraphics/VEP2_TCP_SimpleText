THE DECLARATION OF THE Most Christian King of France and Navarre: Against the
most horr^d proceedings of a rebellio^s party of Parliament Men and Soldiers
in England, against their KING and Country.
Translated out of French, By P.B.
Louis the fourteenth by the grace of God, the most Christian King of France
and Navarre,
to all Christian Kings, Princes, States and People, sends greeting.
WHereas we are informed by our Dear Aunt the Queen of England, of the
distressed estate of the King her Husband, forced upon him by a rebellious
party of his meanest Subjects under the command of the Baron of FAIRFAX, who is
likewise countenanced by a small handful of the basest of the people crept
into the lower House of Parliament, but not being a tenth part thereof, the
worthiest being either imprisoned, or banished by the tyranny of the Army, have
design to proceed against the person and life of their King, which is an
action so detestable, and so destructive to the National Rights of Princes and
people, who are like to be inslaved thereby, and to know no law but that of the
Sword; that we conceive our self obliged by the laws of God and man, in the
duty of a Christian, as well as the rights of a King, either to redeem from
bondage the injured person of our neighbor King and Uncle, or to revenge all
outrages already done, or hereafter which may happen to be done thereupon.

Therefore with the advice of our dear Mother the Queen Regent, and Counsel,
we do publish and declare our detestation of all such proceedings, and vow in
the presence of God and his holy Angels, a full revenge upon all actors or
abettors of this odious design, to the utter extirpation of them, their wives
and children, out of all parts of Christendom wherein our power or interest
can prevail, if they proceed to this damnable fact, we conceiving it fit, to
root out from humane society such a spurious and viperous generation of men.
And we do therefore prohibit all such persons, their wives and children to come
into any of our Dominions, unless they will be proceeded against as traitors
to God and Nations.

And we do likewise invite all our neighbor Kings, Princes and States in amity
with Us, or with whom we have any difference, to an honorable peace* that we
may all join in Gods Cause and our own, to revenge these hypocritical
proceedings of enraged Villains, who (we hear) take the cause of God for their
pretense to destroy his ordinance.

And we desire all our neighbor Kings, Princes and States to make the same
Proclamation we have done, against any of these or their adherents, from coming
into their Territories; that when by Gods justice, and ours and others
endeavors, they shall be chased out of their native country, they may wander
like vagabonds in heathenish places, with the odious brands of Regicides upon
them: and further to consider, whether that if the like madness took any of
their armies, they would not implore our helps, as now this afflicted Queen and
Aunt of ours has occasion to do theirs, against persons who are now twice
Rebels: First, against their lawful Sovereign, upon pretense of reformation
of Government; and now against the very men and authority which raised them for
that pretended occasion; wherein Gods justice is so apparent, that we are
confident he will bless this work intended by us, and which we hope will be
seconded by all persons of honor and Justice both at home and abroad, to help
to suppress these rebels against their raisers; who yet presume upon the
success of their arms to erect their own base thoughts and fortunes, above
the limits of Religion or reason, to suppress that Authority which God has
set over them.

Signed, Louis.
And below, Bryan, Secretary of State.
