THE Beauty of Magistracy, IN AN Exposition of the 82 Psalm, Where is set forth
the Necessity, Vtility, Dignity, Duty, and Mortality of MAGISTRATES. Here many
other Texts of Scripture occasionally are cleared, many Quaeries and Cases of
Conscience about the Magistrates Power, are resolved; many Anabaptistical
Cavils are Confuted; and many seasonable Observations containing many other
Heads of Divinity, are raised. Together with References to such Authors as
clear any Point more fully. By Thomas Hall, B. D. and Pastor of Kingsnorton.

Rickmersworth.

TO All the Pious, Prudent, Zealous and Magnanimous Magistrates, Judges,
Justices, and Gentry, in England, Scotland, and Ireland: Grace and Peace;
Preservation here, and Happiness for ever.
My Lords and Gentlemen,
THE Dedication of this Treatise was intended for the Parliament; but that
being Dissolved, it most properly falls to You, who are under God the Pillars
of the State. Such is the corruption of the Times we live in, that we are put
to dispute every inch of Ground with the Enemies of Truth: Magistracy,
Ministry, Sabbaths, Sacraments, Trinity, Scriptures, etc. all things are now
questioned, nothing believed or practiced by many. Formerly I have vindicated
Baptism, Learning, and the Ministry; now I am come to a Vindication of the
Magistracy. Satan planteth his strongeft Batteries against the Royal Forts of
Magistracy and Ministry; who ever are spared, David and Peter shall be sifted,
knowing that he gains a double advantage by their miscarriage, viz. Example and
scandal: by which two wings it will soar higher, and fly much further.
Swinnock.
Many are the affronts and discouragements which faithful Magistrates meet
with from an ungrateful world, as well as Ministers: you are now cried down
(by those Leveling Libertines, the fifth Monarch-men) as Antichristian and
Beasts (by those brutish men, Jude 10) as well as we. These are their V.
Standard of the Fifth Monarch-men p. 20.
words: The Beast and false Prophet are the wicked bloody, Antichristian
Magistracy, Ministry and Lawyers. We are all here shipped together in the same
bottom, and must sink or swim together, when these Monsters of Munster Reign.
One while we are troubled with Church-Levellers, and anon with State-Levellers;
but God has, and will level all such as go about to level his Ordinances, and
to destroy that Order, which he has, set up in the World, as you may see in
the Treatise, it self.

The sons of Belial may as soon pull the Stars out of the Firmament, as totally
root up Magistracy and Ministry. They are the two great standing Ordinances of
god, which must stand so long as the world stands ( Matthew. 28 ult. 1 Cor. 15.
24. Nec Hesperum nec Luciferum formosiorem esse (...) dixit Aristoteles, Non
est major thesaurus, non elcemosyna opulentior, non bonum excellentius, non res
hominibus utilior (post ipsum verbi Ministerium) quam. M^gistratus suum
facientes officium* Luther*
They are the Pillars of Church and State, they are like the two Pillars in the
Porch of Solomon's Temple, called Jachin and Boaz, i. e. straitnes and strength
(1 Kin. 7. 21) These are two special properties of a good Pillar, it must be
strait and strong; and when Superiors are such, then are they supporters indeed
Psalm. 75. 3. Gal. 2. 9) The Hebrews have a saying, that the world is upheld by
three things, viz. by Justice, Religion and Gratitude; and when these three
fail, world the (say they) decays. But a better then they has told us,
N^cessariae res sunt in rep. been munitae arces, muri, turres and arma; at
nihil sunt haec praesidia prae uno pio Principe, publicae pacis studioso,
Luther.
that when the Judge and the Prophet are taken away, then comes Confusion and
Ruin, Isa. 3, 2, 5. When Sampson would destroy the Philistims, he took hold on
the two Pillars, and brought the house upon their heads, Judge 16. 25, 26, 27.
Take away these two Pillars of Magistracy and Ministry, and you destroy both
Church and State.

The Devil bears an inveterate hatred against these; Pius and magnanimus
Magistratus est vere Gygas, qui co^^tibus improborum se audet opponere; ^ic
enim non Hectorem, non Achillem, sed ipsum prosternit Satanam. Luther in Psalm
82.
they are the two Butts that he specially shoots at; because by them God does
more especially batter his Kingdom: Where Moses and Aaron, the Word and the
Sword go hand in hand together, there Satan's Kingdom falls like lightning from
heaven, suddenly, universally, and irresistibly. I have experimentally found a
greater Visible Reformation in one year (when we had an Col. Greavis.
active, prudent, pious Justice in the Parish) then in twenty before,
notwithstanding all my preaching and assisting of the Officers.

There should therefore be a sweet Harmony and mutual assistance between
Magistrates and Ministers, since the one helps to uphold the other, and they
are ordained by G^d for the mutual aid of each other. The Minister wants the
aid of the Magistrate in Temporals; and the Magistrate wants the Ministers aid
in Spiritual and eternal blessings. The Minister has need of the Magistrates
sword to defend him against unreasonable men; and the Magistrate has need of
the Ministers aid to maintain his authority in the consciences of men, ( Titus
3. 1.) This made a Learned Magistrate to say, Were it but for our felves (viz.
for the upholding of Magistracy) we had need to uphold the Ministry. It Is
State Policy and Church-Policy so to do; for without Ministers men may live
commodiously, but not Piously; and without Magistrates men may live Piously,
but not peaceably and commodiously; like stones in an Arch these two help to
uphold each other. Hence good Jehoshaphat joined Princes and Levites together,
the better to promote and countenance Religion in the Land, (2 Chronicles. 17. 8.)
It Is a great mercy to Magistrates when they have good Ministers to assist and
instruct them, it makes them prosper as King Uzziah did when he had a good
Zachariah, who had understanding in the Visions of God, to counsel him, (2 Chronicles. 26. 3, 4, 5, 7, 8. Hence it is that David had his Seers, Asa his Azariah,
Jehoshaphat his Jehu, Hezekiah his Esaias, Josiah his Huldah, and Zerobabel his
Joshua. These are (or at leastwise ought to be) the Magistrates best Friends,
by their praying preaching and example they help to keep off sin and judgment
from a Land: Hence it is that the Prophet Nathan is called the Friend of David (1
Kings 4. 5.) and Jehoshaphat calls the Levites his Sons, 2 Chronicles. 29. 11. and
King Joash calls Elisha His Father, as King Joram had done before him (2 Kings
6. 22. and 13. 14.) Such reverence did the great ones of the World of Old she^
to Gods Ambassadors. In the late troubles we see hiw those places that had
faithful Ministers to instruct them, were ready to venture their lives and
estates for the public good; when the ignorant Welsh and Irish, and those dark
corners of the earth were habitations of cruelty. An untaught people, are
always an untoward people. Let there be no dissension then between us, for we
are Brethren. Si collidimur, frangimur: if we dash one against another, we
destroy one another. Let there be no interfering or incroaching on each others
Offices; but let each keep within the bounds of that sphere and station,
wherein his God has set him. Magistracy and Ministry are (...) distinct
Callings, Magistratus est ordinatio Dei Creatoris, and ad omne genus hominum
spectat; sed Ministerium Ecclesiasticum est donum and ordinatio Christi.
Mediatoris, ideoque non prorie and jure ordinario spectat nisi ad illos qui de
Ecclesia Christi, Ames. Medul. l. 2. c. 17. 48.
as I have showed in the Treatise it self.

And since the discouragements are many which Magistrates meet withal in the
faithful discharge of their duty: I have therefore set before you the Dignity
of your Calling, and showed how sensible God is of my indignities that are done
unto you. Yet lest any should be pufft up with his Honors, the Holy Ghost
presently adds the Morrality of Magistrates, and tells them, though they be
earthly Gods, yet they must die like men; and though they have been Judges of
the World; yet at last they must be judged themselves: and lest any should
pretend ignorance of their duty, in this Psalm, which I may fitly call, The
Magistrates Directory, is set forth, 1. Nagatively, what Magistrates must not
do. 2. Affirmatively, what they ought to do; with many Reasons dispersed through
the Psalm to quicken them to their duty. So that I do not know a more lively
Psalm for this purpose (all things considered) in the whole Book of Psalms; so
sharp and searching it is, that the bare singing of it at Westminster, the
Sabbath before the Judges were to Vote concerning Ship Money, brought the man
into question that caused it to be sung: and yet the Psalm was composed (as the
Learned conceive) that it might be sung either at the Creation of new
Magistrates, or else before the old Ones, before they went to the Judgment
Seat.

I have the rather been induced to this work, because I have observed that such
as Rulers are, Quales in rep. Principes, tales reliquos solere esse cives,
dixit Cicero.
such usually are the people: if they be erroneous, the people will quickly
follow them, Isa. 3. 12. O my people, Malorum principium sunt mali Principes,
Emman. Thesaurus.
they which lead thee, cause thee to err. One sinner (especially in authority)
destroys much good, Ecceles. 9. 18. Though virtue be more amiable, yet vice is
more imitable, especially in a Prince.
One Rehoboam, Ahab, Jeroboam falling from God, and setting up Idolatry, will
quickly draw all Israel with them, 1 Kings 12. 28, 30. 2 Chronicles. 12. 1. The
wicked walk on every side in great numbers and swarms, when the vilest men are
exalted, Psalm. 12. 9. M^gnorum ^ominum mediocria non sunt peccata. Luther.
The more potent the sinner, the more mischief he does; they have greater power
and more able Instruments at hand to promote their projects and wicked designs.
The great red Dragon that has seven heads, and ten horns, and seven Crowns, i.
e. that has great Potentates to act for him, draws the third part of the
Stars down, and casts them to the earth (Rev. 12. 4.) i. e. Teachers, and
such as by Profession did shine like Stars, yet by the Tyrannical persecution
of those great Ones were drawn to Idolatry. Great men's lives are poor men's
Laws; they are the Looking glasses by which inferiors of times dress
themselves. All their Actions are Examples, and their Examples have a kind of
compulsive power: Hence Peter is said to compel them whom by his Example he
drew to Judaism, Gal. 2. 24. What we see, sinks deeper into us then what we
hear. Segnius irritant animos demissa per aures, Quam qu^e sunt oculis
commissa. Horat.
On the contrary, when great men are good men, they do much good; if Asa and
Hezekiah be forward in reforming, so are the people, ^ Chron. 15. 9, 10, 11,
12. and 31. 1. When certain Ambassadors praised the Lacedemonian Soldiers for
their good Order, who before were mutinous, one of them ingenuously answered,
Nos iidem sumus ut nuper, sed alius nunc nobis est Dux. We are the same men
still, but now we have another General. This is the very end why God advances
any to honor, that so they might honor him, Hest. 4. 14.

It Was Vespatians Honor that his greatness Nec quicq^am in te mutavit ^ortunae
ampl^tudo, nisi ut prodesse t^atundem posses and velles. Plin. Epis. ad Vespat.
became more advantageous to him in the promoting of goodness. To encourage
you, know, that if you build Gods House, he will build your houses (Exodus 1.
20, 21.) if you advance his name, he will advance your names; and if you honor
him, you shall be honored by him. We see in all Ages how Reforming Princes
have prospered as Moses, Joshua, Jehoshaphat, Hezekiah* Asa, 2 Chronicles. 14 2, to
8. See Mr. Woodwards Chronicle of the Good Kings of Judah. Princeps religionem

What made Q. El^zabeth flourish? Why, she was happy in her Counselors (by
whom she was for the most part ruled) and so grew amiable to her Friends, and
terrible to her Foes. Wisdom is better then strength, or weapons of War,
Eccels. 9. 18. Romani cedendo vincunt. The welfare of a State is preserved, not
so much by a multitude of Warriors, It Was a foul blot upon Chilperick a King of
France, that he was Titularis non Tutelaris Rex; de^uit non praefuit Reip.
as of Wi^e and Pious Counselors. Many Soldiers think it needless to Guard
th^se who have the long-sword to Guard themselves; but let such know, that he
is but sorrily Guarded who has himself only, and a few Fellow Creatures for
his Guardians. Optim^m munimentum est m^nimento ca^^re.
If God be against you, what good can your long Sword do you? Ezekiel. 3. 3. 26.
Piety and Integrity are the b^st Guardians.

2. Encourage a Learned, Pious and Laborious Ministry. To this end improve your
Interest for the buying in of Impropriations, that so every Congregation may
have an able Pastor; for we see by daily experience that scandalous means
breeds scandalous Ministers. Tithes are no burden to any but such as esteem the
faithful dispensing of the Gospel a burden; but for men to Plow and Sow for
such as are truly Impropriators, is a great grievance through the Land. How many
steal the Goose and s^ick down a feather? swallow an hundred pound per annum?
and allow the Minister four pound per annum, the blood of souls cries against
such men: and if the blood of Abels body cried so loud against Cain, how loud
will the blood of so many souls cry against these Sacrilegious Cainites? The
abolishing also of that Clause in 31. Henry 8. 13. which exempts many great
Livings from paying of Tithes, because they paid none in the times of Abbots
and Friars, were a very Noble Work, and well beseeming a Parliament; for by
this means a great part of many Parishes pay nothing toward the maintenance of
the Gospel, and the burden lies upon a few Tenants and inferior persons, who
sometimes pay fifty shillings, whilst the Lord of the Manor pays not five
pence. How many Patrons of Churehes are Latrons, robbing their Ministers whom
they are bound to defend?

3. If ever the Lord shall call you to Parliament again, labor to find out
some expedient for an Accommodation and the reconciling of Gods people amongst
themselves. See Motives and Directions for an Accommodation in D. Boltons
Arraignment of Error, p. 340. ad finem, libr^.
Unity and Unanimity in Gods Worship (which some look upon as a misery) is
indeed a great mercy, and is enjoined by the Apostle as a special duty, 2. Cor.
13. 11. Be of one mind, q. d. Though there have been divisions and dissentions
amongst you, yet now be Unanimous, and live in Peace together. It Is of greater
consequence then many imagine. See the danger of Divisions, in Mr Clarks Tract
against Toleration. p. 35* and 40. etc.
Division in the Church breeds dissension in the State, and a State divided
cannot long stand. The Apostle would never so earnestly have beso^ght, and so
strongly adjured Gods people to Unanimity, had it not been a special duty, Romans
15. 5. 1. Cor. 2. 20. Philip. 2. 1, 2. The Aut^ors and Fautors of those sad
Divisions and sub-divisions which abound amongst us, have much to answer for
before the Lord. It Is easily seen at what do^r they come in upon us. The best
means that I know to suppress exorbitances in the State, is Parliaments; and to
suppress disorders in the Church, is Synods. That Synods are Gods Ordinance,
and have been blessed with success from God, is confessed by all sober men on all
hands; and why an V Cottons Keys, chap. 5 p. 25. and Buroughs Irnicum, chapter 7.
p. 43, 44. Boltons Arraignment of er. for p. 266. etc.
Ordinance of Christ should lie so long unpractised I know not? How long shall
the Church of God lie as a Field without a Fence, and a Vineyard without a
Hedge, so that every wild Beast breaks in upon it? For want of Discipline,
what corruption in manners, and Errors in Doctrine like a Flood have broken in
upon us, and there is none to restrain them! for want of it young Ministers
begin to degenerate both in their Life and Doctrine, since they find the reins
to lie so loose upon their own necks. The Presbyterian Government is that
Government which by Covenant we are bound to promote: it being that Government
which all the Reformed Churches of Christ do practice; and the only Platform
of Government which carries a Ius Divinum in the forehead of it. S^e my
Comment. on 2 Timothy 3. 8* p. 174, 175. etc.
Let those that can, produce a better Platform; that model of our late
dissenting Anonymus (I shall not say Anomalous) Brethren has made the Breach
wider then ever; yea, V. Declaration of the Faith, and Order of the
Congregational Churches, 1658.
some that wavered in that point, are now convinced of the weakness and
insufficiency of their grounds for that way of Independency. We have some
Government in the State; yet Church Government and Reformation ought to be
preferred before that of the State, is* proved to my hand by a Learned Pen. Mr.
Anthony Burgess his Fast Sermon. on Judge 6. 27. Preached 1645.
The Politicians of the World abuse Rulers when they go about to prepossess
them with prejudice against the Kingdom and Discipline of Christ, as if twere
distructive to the Civil Government; whereas if they would but look abroad into
the world they should find that the Rulers of the world have not more free,
faithful, loyal Subjects then those that are truly Religious, and willing to
submit their necks to Christ's sweet and easy yoke.

4. Restrain that Spirit of Error and Delusion, which like Wildfire has
spread over all the land. That men should be tolerated to worship the Devil (as
it is easy to prove the Quakers do, if we consider the men, the matter, and the
manner of their speaking) is very sad.
Nothing will please some men, but a boundless Toleration of all sorts and
Sects; no Magistrate nor Minister must control them, all Government to such
ungoverned ones is Tyranny and persecution. How well this Toleration agrees
with our National Covenant, wherein we vowed the extirpation of Heresies, and
whatsoever is contrary to sound Doctrine, let the world judge. It Was the great
sin of Julian the Apostate, that he granted Liberty to Pagans and Heretics,
that by letting such weeds grow, he might the better destroy Gods Harvest. It Is
charged as a sin upon the Church of Thyatira, Against Toleration, see an
elaborate Treatise of Mr. Clerk, called, Apples of Gold.
that she tolerated Jezabel to seduce Christ's people, Rev. 2. 14, 20.

5. It were to be wished that some effectual course were taken for the
enjoining of all Governors under a penalty to send in their children and
servants, both publicly and privately to be Ca^echized. The gross Ignorance
which still abounds in the body of our people is lamentable. Religion makes the
best children, the best servants, and the best Subjects* as we see in Abraham's
Catechized Family, how promptly does every one there perform his duty? It Is just
with God to suffer Inferiors to rebel against their Superiors, when they suffer
them to Rebel against God.

6. It were to be wished that some course might be taken for the better
Regulating of Parishes; it is sad to see how unequally they are divided. In many
places one Parish comes to another Parish Church-walls, and yet these people
belong to another charge, it may be three or four miles off. Parochial
Assemblies (if they were made more Uniform and compact) are best both for
Pastor and people. V. Mr. Firmin against Schism, chap. 2. p. 39. etc.


7. Free-Schools are very much wanting in many parts of the Nation. Children
are the Seminary of the Church; and if the seed be naught* the crop cannot be
good.

Quest. But where is the means to maintain those Schools?

Answ. Since all is devoured, I know but one way that is left, and that is by
the Improvement of Commons and Wast-lands; they might (if wisely managed by
Commissioners from Parliament; for the Cormudgeans of the world will never
consent to part with a Turff for Christ, if they can help it) be improved to
ten times the value that now they are at, to the benefit of the Parishioners,
and the advancement of many pious Uses.

8. It were to be wished that all Market To^ns that are very populous, and have
men fit for Government in them, were freely made Corporations; and that
Inferior Market Towns had a Justice of Peace, either in them, or planted very
near them, that the people might not run seven miles to have a Swearer,
Drunkard, or Sabbath-Profaner punished. This would prevent abundance of sin
which is committed in these places, at Markets and Fairs especially, for want
of Justices.

The Lord, the Righteous Judge of all, direct you by his Spirit, preserve you
from sin and error, he fasten you as a nail in a sure place, crown your
endeavors with success for the settling of Truth and Peace upon firm
foundations in this distracted, distressed Church and State; he make all
Mountains a (...) before you, that you may be the Repaires of our Breaches, and
the raisers of the Foundations for many Generations, that the children unborn
(in their Generations) may Rise up, and call you blessed. This is, and shall be
the Prayer of

Your devoted Servant in the work of the Lord, Tho. Hall.

Christian Reader,
MUch might be said, and that deservedly; concerning the beauty of this
Exposition of the 82 Psalm, called by the worthy Author, The Beauty of
Magistracy; it discovering that Ordinance of God, Magistracy, in its genuine
Beauty and Luster. As my many occasions would permit, I have perused several
parts thereof, and can assure the Reader, that I find the Exposition solid and
judicious, the method clear and perspi^uous, the style terss and clean, yet
grave and Theological; the application warm, holy, and proper, the whole
learned, gracious, and worthy the eye, love, and practice of a judicious
Reader, who has the encourag^ment to peruse it, and also that he may do it
with profit, the prayers in his perusing it, of

The Beauty of Magistracy. AN EXPOSITION Of the 82. PSALM, A Psalm of Asaph, OR
A Psalm for Asaph.
VER. 1.
God stands in the Congregation of the mighty, he judges among the Gods.
TO speak any thing in Commendation of the Book of Psalms, were to pour water
into the Sea, or to set up a Light to the Sun; it is so fully done already by
others, that I shall only refer you to V. Piscators Preface in his Comment on
the Psalms. And Mr. Roberts Key to the Bible, before the Psalms.
them, and so pass on.

We read of diverse Psalms in the Book of Psalms, Psalterium est quaedam
Coelestis sphaera, stellis densa micantibus; est Paradisus animarum, poma^
continens innumera, quibus men's humana suaviter saginata pinguescit.
Cassiodorus.
which bear the Title of Asaph; as Psalm. 50, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81,
82, 83. The Question is, whether these Psalms were written By Asaph, or For
Asaph, Duodecim sunt Psalmi qui Asaph inscribuntur; ^ Lap. 13. says Weemse. Le
Asaph i. e. Asaphi vel Asapho, nam Le inservit tum Genitivo, tum (...)
since the Original will bear both. Some conceive that Asaph was the Author and
Inditer of the Psalm, for Asaph was a Seer and a Prophet and made Psalms as
well as David, as appears, 2 Chronicles. 29. 30. (...), Psalmus ipsi Asapho, Sept.
V^rsio Arabica. ^ontan* Scultetus, Piscator.
The Levites praised God with the words of David and Asaph the Seer; Yet the
best and most Interpreters do conceive that this Psalm was made by David, and
committed to Asaph as chief Singer, or to his Sons who were singers in Israel,
( 1 Chronicles. 25. 2.) It Is usual in Scripture to put the Head of a Family for the
Family it self, as Aaron for his Sons, 1 Chronicles. 12. 27. Canticum ipsi Asaph,
tradi^um ut decantaretur. Vatabl.
to be sung for the use of the Church of God. Hence the Geneva Translation
renders it, A Psalm committed to Asaph. That some of those twelve or thirteen
Psalms which bear Asaph's Title, yet were David's Psalms, appears by the style
of them, Who were the several Penmen of the Psalms, you may see in the
Exercitations of Weems, Exercit. 18. page 166.
and is almost confessed on all hands: whether this eighty second Psalm be one of
these, let the Reader judge. But since David. and Asaph were both holy Prophets
of God and divinely inspired; and specially since our Savior himself has
confirmed the Divine Authority of this Psalm, In re tam parvi momenti liberum
sit cuique judicium.
by referring us to it ( John 10 36.) it is needless to enquire which of them
wrote it, since we are assured that it is Canonical Scripture.

This Psalm may fitly be called the Magistrates Psalm, or the Magistrates
Directory; the matter of it is Didactical and Doctrinal, setting forth the
Dignity, Duty, and Mortality of Magistrates and Judges; whom the Psalmist
exhorts to a faithful discharge of their places, by an impartial
administration of Justice, in punishing the wicked, and defending the good; and
this he backs with many weighty Arguments.

The first is drawn from the Presence of God: he is said in a more especial
manner to be Present and President with these his Vicegerents and Deputies.
Verse 1.

2. From the Dignity of their place and calling: They represent the Person of
God, they bear his Name, and are called his Sons, and therefore they ought more
especially Patrizare, to resemble their Father in doing Justice and Judgment.

3. In respect of their Mortality; they must die as other men, and come to
judgment, and give an account for all that they have done.

4. That his words might bave the greater weight he brings in God himself
expostulating and reasoning the case with those unjust Judges, for their abuse
of that Power which he had given them* Verse 2.

5. He exhorts them to a Right performance of their Duty, by an impartial
dispensing of justice unto all. Verse 3, 4.

6. He aggravates their sin by their sottish ignorance and wilful negligence.
They were Lucifugae, haters of the light. Verse 5. They know not, neither will
they understand, yea they walk on in darkness, albeit the very foundations of
the earth be moved. q. d. though all things be in confusion and disorder, and
the very Pillars of the State shake under them by reason of their Oppression
and Tyranny, Bribery, and Partiality, yet they would not see it to amend it,
but made their Lusts their Law to their own confusion.

7. He concludes with Prayer, and by an Apostrophe turns his speech to God,
Verse 8. Arise O God, judge thou the earth, q. d. O Lord, I see it is in vain to
expect justice from these unjust ones; Do thou therefore O thou just Judge of
all the world, Arise, and take the matter into thine own hands, execute justice
for those that are oppressed; for all the Nations of the world are thy proper
Possession.

VER. 1.
God stands in the Congregation of the mighty, he judges among the Gods.
THEY are the words of the Prophet, who like an Herald proclaims the Presence
of God amongst the Gods and Judges of the earth. This Preface the Prophet
makes; the better to excite the Attention of those great ones, whose
corruption, licentiousness and pride is such, that they think they may act and
speak, they may absolve or condemn at their own bar who please themselves
without control: God does not see (say they) nor will he take notice of our
actings: stay there (says the Prophet) for he sees you, and stands by you too,
though you see not him; God stands in the Congregation of the mighty, he
judges among the Gods.

In these words we may observe, 1. The Person Ruling, God. 2. His Posture, He
stands. 3. The Place where; In the Congregation of the mighty. (...), in
intimo. Aquila.
4. An Exegesis or illustration of what he had said before, He judges *
amongst the Gods.


1. The Person Ruling is God, the supreme Ruler of the world, Eloa^ is the
singular Number.
Elohim, the word is Plural, yet the word that answers it is singular; this
notes (say some) a Plurality of persons in Unity of Essence. See this Point
fully cleared in those elaborate Annotations of Mr. Ley on Genesis 1. 1.
The Holy Ghost begins the Bible with this plural name of God, joined with a
Verb singular, Geh. 1. 1. Elohim Bara, Dii creavit i. e. the mighty Gods, or
all the three Persons in the Godhead, created. Verbum singular simplicissimam
Dei essentiam; nomen autem plurale designat tres personas. Bucan. loc. 1. page
7. ubi plura. Consule a Lapide in Genesis 1. 1.
This is one of the most ancient names of God, and the first that is given him
in Scripture, Genesis 1. 1. and 1. 26. and 3. 1. and 19. 24. The word is very
significant and notes unto us, that as God is the Creator, Governor and
Upholder of the world; so he is also the Judge and Punisher of such as do evil,
and the rewarder of such as do well.

2. Here is his Posture, He stands, he does not ^it; standing is a posture of

Participle of the Present Tense implies, it notes a continued Act, signifying
that God is present at all the Assizes, Sessions, and Sittings of Magistrates.
The same word is used, Isa. 3. 13. the Lord stands up (or is standing up) to
plead, yea he stands up to Judge the people.

3. Here is the place where he stands. In Coetu Dei fortis. Hieron. Calvin.
Tremel. i. e. in medio judicum quibus Deus praeect, id^oque eorum coetus coetus
Dei hic appellatur. Mu^s.
It Is in the Congregation of the mighty. Some read in thus, God stands in the
Assembly of God; had they said in the Assembly of God, the Original would bear
it, for the word is El, not Elohim; and therefore is rendered by the Learned, In
the Assembly of God. El est nomen Dei qu^ sig^ificatur Deum esse sua ^ssenti^
fortissimum, imm^ ipsam fortitudinem, a quo omnis fortitudo emanat. Polanus.
Both Translations are right for sense, but the words in the Letter run thus;
God stands in the Congregation of God. q. d. God stands in his own Assembly
i. e. he is present in the Assembly of those Judges who are constituted and
ordained by him to execute Justice and Judgment for his people. Gnedah,
Coetus, conventus, Congregatio; significat ordinatam Congregationem qualis est
populi qui regitur justis l^gibus. Moller. u^cun* refulgeat Dei gloria in
singulis mundi partibus, praecipuum tame^ lumen hac in part emittit, dum
legitima gub^rnatio inter mortales viget. Calv.
God delights not in Tumultuary routs, or seditious heaps, where there is no
Law, no Rule, no Order; but he being the God of Order, delights to dwell
amongst his people who delight in Order; and especially amongst the Rulers of
his people, who are deputed by him to Rule in Righteousness.

He judges (as he will judge) amongst the Gods.

These words are Exegetical and help to illustrate what he had said before.
Ishpot. judicabit. Heb. i. e. Sicut ab initio judicavit, ita and nunc judicat,
and semper judicabit.
God stands in the Congregation of God. What Is that? Why he judges as Supreme
amongst the Judges of the world; he stands not as a Cipher, or a bare
Spectator, but he himself makes one amongst them.

1. He judges Actively amongst them, we look upon men and think the judgment
is theirs, Shaphat, judicavit, punivit, animadvertit, vindicavit, bonus
defendendo, and malos puni^ndo. Leigh.
but it is God that exercises judgment amongst them; he knows the Causes,
directs the Judges, and executes the Sentence. Judges are but Deputies under
God; the work of judging properly and principally belongs unto him, and
therefore he is said, not only to be amongst them, but in the very Kereb,
medium, significat quicquid est propinquissimum and intimum. Genesis 48 16. Psalm.
5. 9. and 49. 11. Pagnin.
midst of them, to let them know that none of their consultations or actings
are hid from him.

2. Passively, he is so in the midst of these earthly Gods, that if they do
unjustly, Elohim judicat, Elohim i. e. summus and coelesti^; Elohim judicat
inf^riores and terrestres Elohim, quibus divinam suan potestatem regendi and
judicandi communicavit. a Lapide. Regum timendorum in proprios gr^ges; Reges in
ipsos imperium est Iovis. Seneca Tragoed.
he will execute Justice on them, and judge the Judges of the world; for though
they be great, yet there is a greater then they, to whom they must shortly give
an account.

Quest. Some may demand Who are meant by Gods here?

Answ. By Gods here is meant Judges and Magistrates (as our Savior interprets
it, John 10. 34. who are Gods Lieutenants and Vicegerents, appointed in his
stead to administer Justice to his people.

This Title in Scripture is taken 3. ways.
1. Primarily and Properly. 2. Secundarily and Metaphorically. 3.
Catachrestically and Abusively.
1. This Title of God (Elohim) is given Primarily, Properly and most Truly to
God, who is the Creator and Governor of the world, and in this sense there is
but one God. (1 Cor. 8. 6.) and besides him there is no Lord, Isa. 44. 6. and
45, 22.

2. Metaphorically and All^sively, and so there are Gods many, 1 Cor. 8. 5.
Thus the holy Angels are called Elohim, Gods. (2 Samuel 28. 13. Zach. 1 2. 8.
Psalm. 8. 5. thou have made him little lower then Elohim, which the Apostle
calls Angels, Heb. 2. 6. and 27. So Psalm. 97. 7. Worship him all ye Gods, i. e.
all ye Angels of God. Now they are called Gods because of all creatures they
are the most excellent, and the fairest representations of his Majesty, Wisdom,
and Power, being always ready to do his will in defending the Godly, and
Punishing the Ungodly.

Some read the Text thus, God stands in the Congregation of Angels: this is a
truth, but not from this Text; for the Context clearly confutes it, ver. 2. How
long will ye judge Unjustly? So that it is plain he speaks not of Angels who are
perfect, but of men who may and do err and act unjustly.

2. The Title is applied to Magistrates and Judges, Exodus 21. 6. and 22. 28.
Deuteronomy. 19. 7. Psalm. 82. 6. and 138. 1. And least any should think that this is
an Old Testament Title only, we find Christ himself making mention of it in the
new, Gubernatio est divina quaedam virtus, ideoque vocat Deus Magistratus
omnes, Deos, non propter creationem sed propter administrationem quae est
solius Dei: Qui igitur est in regimine, est quasi incarnarus Deus. Luther.
John 10* 34, 35. Neither is the Title given only to one or two, but it is
given generally to all Magistrates, be they good or bad. Ver. 6. I have said ye
are Gods; i. e. ye are all Gods and Sons of the most High; not by Regeneration
and Adoption; but in respect of your Profession and the Office which you bear.

Now they are called Gods, 1. Not Essentially or by Nature, for we see they die
as other men, but by Participation, Representation and Office; because they do
in a sort participate of Gods Dignity, Dii dicuntur Partitipative, nuncupative
and Analogice, non essentialiter and natura.
Authority and Power; as Stars borrow their light from the Sun, so do Rulers
their power from God. He has set them in his place, and therefore he gives
them his Title, because they are Deputies under him to execute justice in the
world. Dii vocantur homines admiratione dignf, praesertim qui al^is praesunt,
ideoque Metaphoric^s propter communicatam a Deo potentiam atque officium aliis
ope^^ ferendi, eosque defendendi, sustentandi, fovendi, mundum, regna Urbesque
regendi. Polanus. Humani Jove's. Plautus.
There is (...), a sparkle of divine Majesty appearing in Magistracy, yea God
has engraven a special note of his own glory and Image on them. So that by
Analogy they may well be called Gods, as resembling God, in having the Power of
life and death in their hand; hence the Apostle puts an Emphasis on this, That
they are the Ministers of God, and rule for him, Romans 13. 4.

2. This Title is given them, because God is pleased to bestow many excellent
and Divine-Gifts of the spirit on them; hence it is that Moses is called Pharaohs
God, (Exodus 7. 1.) because God had given him power to speak unto Pharaoh in his
name, and to execute Vengeance on him. Though all Magistrates are not
Regenerate, yet they may have many excellent, Heroic, Moral Virtues and common
gifts of the Spirit, as Justice, Prudence, Patience, Temperance, Fortitude,
Liberality, and to fit them for Government, Numb 6. 11. 17. 1 Samuel 10. 6, 9,
10. and 16. 13, 14. Acts 14. 11.

3. By Deputation from God whose Lieutenants they are, and to whom they must
give an account for the male administration of their office. They derive their
power from him as his Delegates by Commission, and so bear his Title.

3. The Title is used Catechrestically and Abusively, and so is attributed 1.
(...) and nomine tenus.
To Idols, Genesis 31. 32. and 35. 2 Exodus, 12. 12. Judge. 17. 5. 1 Cor. 8. 5.
because Idolaters give divine worship to them, though by nature they are no
Gods ( Gal. 4. 8.) and therefore the Apostle calls them Nothing, 1 Cor. 8. 4.
an Idol is nothing; though Materially it is Wood and Stone, yet formally it is
nothing, i. e. it is not that which the Idolater conceives it is, it is not God,
and there is no holiness in it; though (...) in the conceit and corrupt
imagination of the Idolater it is a God, yet (...) and in truth it is nothing.
Diabolus non est simpliciter Deus, sed illis est Deu^ qui illum anteponunt
Christo. Eramus.


2. To the Devil; he is called the God of this world; (2 Cor. 4. 4.) because
the wicked of the world obey the Devils will before Gods will, and delight to
do his works, Diabolus dicitur Deus respectu hominum, tum rati^nn perversae
opinionis, tum ratione vitiosae and inordinatae subjectionis. Gerhard.
( John 8, 44.) and so make him their God, he Rules in them, and they readily
obey him as their God.

3. Any thing that a man adores or esteems more then God, that is his God. Thus
some men make Mammon and Riches their God, Job 32. 24. others make their Belly
their God, Amor tuus Deus tuus; illud est cuique Deus quod maxim colit, cuique
totus servit, and sese suaque, omnia impendit.
( P^il. 3. 19. Romans 16. 18.) they are slaves to their Epicurean pleasures and
lusts, serving them in stead of God.

Observations.
1. It Is requisite sometimes to Preface before we speak: especially when the
matter is weighty, it is good to quicken attention by some serious, grave,
Agumentative and nervous Preface. The Psalmist does so here, ver. 1. there are
almost as many Arguments as there are words in the verse, proclaiming the
Majesty, Omniscience and all seeing eye of God; Quot verba, tot argumenta; quot
dictiones, tot stimuli.
the better to prepare us for that which follows in the Psalm, wherein are
matters of the greatest moment. Thus when the Lord published the Ten
Commandments, the better to prepare us for the hearing and obeying of them, he
sets a short, but pithy Preface before them. (Exodus 20. 2) I am the Lord thy
God which brought thee out of the Land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
Every word has its weight. 1. I am Jehovah by whom you live, move and have
your being. 2. Thy God by Creation and by Covenant. 3. That brought Israel out
of Egyptian bondage, and have delivered thee from a far viler slavery and
bondage, even from the slavery of sin and Satan, from the Curse of the Law, the
guilt of sin, from Death, Hell and Wrath to come. So Christ himself set a
Preface before the Lords Prayer, the better to prepare our hearts for the duty,
according to that of Solomon Eccles. 5. 2.

Observation 2.
That there is a Trinity of Persons in the Unity of Essence. V. Rive^ in Genesis
1. 1. P. 5, 6.
The Persons or Subsistences are three, yet the Divine Essence is but one,
being equally communicated to all; hence these three are said to be one. 1 John
5. 7. Mat. 28. 19. 1 Cor. 12. 4, 5, 6, 11. and 2. 13. 13.

Now let all the world dispute and wrangle their hearts out; yet these three or
four Texts (if there were no more) are sufficient to settle any gracious soul
in the truth of this point.

As for those Photinian, Arrian, Antitrinitarian, Socinian Heretics, which are
of late so rife amongst us, who list may see them fully and learnedly confuted
in Dr. Owens Treatise against Blasphemous Biddle. Chap. 7. page 138. Dr.
Cheynell in defense of the Trinity. D. Arnoldus contra Socin. cap. 1. q. 32.
page 136. D. Prideaux Lect. 17. page 261. fol. Mr. Nortons Orthodox Evangelist,
Chap. 2. and 21.

Observation 3.
Our God is the most mighty and powerful God. He is not only El, strong, but
Elohim, Almighties or All-powers. All the weight and power that is in the
Creature, it is in him Originally, Operatively, Elohim est unum e nominibus Dei,
a potentia, robore and fortitudine Dei; Deus enim omnia potest. Ravanel. See
more, Hieroms Ser. on Exodus 34. 6. on the word, El, Strong.
Eminently. His Power is like himself infinite and Unspeakable, beyond the
Tongues expression, or the hearts imagination. This may comfort us in
adversity, God is able to raise us and deliver us, Psalm. 34. 19. Though our
enemies be great, yet our comfort is that there is a greater then they. Job 32.
14. Eccles. 5. 8. Ephesians. 6. 9. though we be weak, yet our Redeemer is strong,
Ier, 50. 33, 34. this upheld those three Caldean Worthies, The God whom we
serve is able to deliver us, Dan. 3. 16, 17. God is not only faithful, but
Almighty and powerful to fulfill all his promises to his people. 2. It must
keep us Humble in Prosperity; for as God has power to give, so he has power
to take all from us if we abuse it to his dishonor. Hosea 2. 8. to 13. In his
hand is our Life, Health, Wealth and all that we possess. Whom will we fear, if
we fear not him?

Observation 4.
Magistrates must not desire to be solitary and Independent. As Affectation of
Independency is an error in the Church, so also in the State; hence the Lord
tells us here of a Senate and Assembly of Judges. God has not committed this
power to one Magistrate, for that would be a burden too heavy even for a Moses
alone, Deuteronomy. 1. 19. But which is a great mercy, it is committed to many. One man
(we say) is no man. Woe to him that is alone and has none to counsel him.
That which ruined Julius Caesar, Julius Caesar Nec in dictatura, nec in
consula^u cohsilio Senatus usus est, unde se and Remp. perditit. Idem fecit
Nero qui Senatum capitaliter oderat. Suetorm.
was self-conceitedness and refusing to consult with the Senate. What a sad
condition would Nations soon be in if they were subject to the Will, Lust, and
Tyranny of one, single man? It Is in the multitude of Counselors that there is
safety. Prove. 11. 14. Hence Moses appointed many Judges over the people, Exodus
18. 21, 22. Number. 6. 11, 16, 17. and we read of a Senate of seventy Elders and
Senators which were appointed by God himself to rule the people, and he ordered
Appeals from inferior Courts, to which all cases of difficulty were re^erred
both in Ecclesiastical and Civil affairs. Ne unus duntaxat judex a^ forum sit,
qui statim de quovis negotio ferat ultima^ sententiam; a qua provscare non
liceat: sed in unaquaque Rep. plures judiciorum gradus esse oportet, ut sit
locus provocationi, Plato de Legibus. Lib. 6.
Deuteronomy. 17, 8, 9, 10, 11. 2 Chronicles. 19. 8. to 11. Appeals are de jure naturae,
they are founded in nature; even Reason tells us that it is unfit that any man
should be a Judge, witness and accuser in his own cause; no wise or sober man
will desire such Independency; Solitary Birds are usually Birds of prey; but
Sheep, Bees, and Doves which are Congregative creatures, are most harmless and
innocent.

Observation 5.
Magistracy is Gods Ordinance. It Is no humane device or Politic invention to
keep men in awe; but its Original is from heaven; it is a Plant of Gods own
Planting, which shall never be rooted up so long as the world endures, maugre
the malice of all fanatic seditious Levellers whatsoever. Indeed when Christ
comes to judgment at the end of the world, then and not till then he will put
down all Rule and all Authority and Power; for in Heaven there will be no need
of them, 1 Cor. 15. 24. God is the Author, Approver and Defender of Magistracy,
from him they have their Mission and Commission; all that rule and reign, are
either Missi, or Permissi: either sent by him (1 Pes. 2. 14.) or suffered by
him. Usurpers by Permission and lawful Governors by Comm^ssion from him; the
one by his Providence and some kind of approbation, the other by his Ordinance
and appointment; for there is no Power but it is of God; the Power is his,
however men come by it, or however they abuse it; though many have not only
acquired it by wicked means, but administered it in a wicked manner: yet still
the Magistrates Authority not only Abstractly considered in it self, but
Concretly in the person administering it is of God, Da^. 2. 21. and 4 32. John
9. 11. Romans 13. 1. the powers that are, they are of God; Permissio not at
aliquod indultum, ordinatio vero mandatum; 2. Permissio est eorum quae
displicent and improbantur; ordinatio vero est eorum quae cum voluntate and
approbatione fiunt. Baldwin. Oc.
whether the persons be good or bad, yet the Office is from him, and that not
only Permissive, Ordinative, Directive for so sin, sickness, are of God by way
of permission, ordering and directing; but Magistracy is of God approbative and
mandativ^ by way of approbation and command. They bear his name, they wear his
Livery, they are employed in his work, he takes their account and rewards them.
Hence it is that in the Text their Assembly is called Gods Assembly; and their
Throne Gods Throne. (1 Chronicles. 29. 23.) and their judgment Gods Judgment, (
Deuteronomy. 1. 17. 2 Chronicles. 19. 6. The Judgment is Gods, i. e. it is of God and for
God; it is of God in respect of Ordination, and for God in respect of
Administration. Hence the Apostle calls the Magistrate three times together in
express terms, The Miniter of God, to defend the good, and punish the bad (
Romans 13. 4, 5, 6.) This he could not be, had he not his* Power and Authority
from God. This made the Psalmist to counsel Kings and Judges not to cast away
their office, but to submit to Christ and serve him in their places of Dignity,
( Psalm. 2. 10.) he does not condemn them for being Kings and Rulers, nor does
he bid them leave their places, but he minds them of their duties; and yet it
appears that this Psalm was penned for Gospel Times, when Christ should have
the Heathen for his Inheritance, and the utmost parts of the earth for his
possession: So that the Regulating of Magistracy being here enjoined, the
establishing hereof is also plainly employed.

Magistracy is very ancient. Murderers and Adulterers were to die by Law long
ago, Genesis 9. 6. and 38. 24. and we read of Magistrates all along, as Joseph,
Moses, Joshua, The Judges, the seventy Elders, Eli, Samuel, David, Solomen,
Josiah, Iehosaphat, Hez^kiah etc. these Godly men would never have born Rule if
they had ever conceived that the Office had been sinful. And least any should
Object that these are Old Testament Examples, we read also in the New Testament
of a Noble man or (...) quidam, Beza.
Viceroy that believed, ( John 4. 46. 50.) and Joseph of A^imathea a Senator
and honorable Conncellors, Mark 15. 43. and of a Deputy* Procon^ul, or
Propraetor that was converted to the faith, Acts 13. 7. 12. and Cornelius a
Centurion, Acts 10. 1 2 yet did they not leave their Office. The Eunuch that
was Treasurer to the Queen of Candace, when he became a Christian, yet we do
not read that he left his place, Acts 8. 38. Erastus the Chamberlain of
Corinth, did not, V. Plura apud Suecanum de Magistratu Pars quinta. p. 594.
because he was a Christian, cast off his government, Romans 16. 23. So
Constantine, Theodosius and other good men, kept their Magistracy still, which
they would not have done, had it been unlawful.

2. In Scripture we find Rules for Rulers ( Exodus 18. 21. Deuteronomy. 1. 16, 17. and
25. 1. Psalm. 2. 10. Romans 13. 3, 4.) Now these would be in vain if there were no
Rulers to observe them.

3. God oftsends men to the Magistrate for help in their distress, Exodus 22. 9.
Deuteronomy. 17. 8. This God would not do if the Office were unlawful.

Object. These are Old Testament proofs. Answ. Christ sends us to the
Magistrate in the New, Mat. 5. 25. Luke 12. 58. Paul when in danger of his
life, appeals to the Magistrate, which he would not have done, had it been a
sin.

4. We are commanded to Pray for Magistrates ( Genesis 20. 17 and 47. 10. Ier. 29.
7. 1 Timothy 2. 2) but if their Office were evil, we should rather pray against
them; Now we are to pray for nothing but what is good and pleasing unto God.

5. Christ who is the eternal Wisdom of his Father, tells us that it is by him
that Kings reign and Princes decree Justice, yea Nobles and all Judges of the
earth, Prove. 8. 15, 16 not only Superior, but also Inferior Rules are
appointed by Christ; he sets up not only Kings, but Princes and Nobles also;
from him they have their Ordination, Conservation and Qualifications; it is he
that gifts them with wisdom to make good and just Laws for the benefit and
peace of their people. It Is he that pulls down one and sets up another in the
Throne, and none may say unto him, What do thou? Job 9. 12 and 12. 18. and
34. 24.

6. The Lord commands Subjects to obey Magistrates and give Honor, and pay
Tribute to them; this certainly implies (by the Rule of Relatives) that there
must be Magistrates to whom this Honor and Tribute is due: And if every soul
must be subject to the Higher Powers, then there must be Higher Powers; to
which men must be subject. This enjoining the duty of the Subject, does
establish the authority of the Magistrate; for they are Correlatives and
Individuals.

7. That awe and dread which is in the hearts of men toward Magistracy, See 8.
Arguments more to prove the lawfulness of the Civil Magistrate, in Dr. Featly
against the Anabaptist. Article 6. p. 153, 154.
argues that there is much of God in it. To see so many thousands of men of
contrary dispositions, and perverse tempers, yet to live peaceably together
under the Government of one man, shows plainly that the hand of God is here.

Object. But some may Object, that if God be the Author of Magistracy, how is
it said (Hosea 8. 4.) They set up Kings, but not by me; they made Princes, and
I knew it not.

Answ. The Answer is easy, Multa dicuntur non esse ^ Deo i. e. co jubente vel
approbante, quae tamen non sunt sine Deo permittente and permittere volente.
River.
They set up Kings by Gods permission, but not by his Approbation. I knew it
not (says God) viz. so as to approve of it. It Is true, I let them go on in
their own way, but I neither did, nor will take cognizance of what they do so
as to bless them in it. Many a man Rules by Providence, not by promise. So then
God does not here disclaim the Ordinance of Magistracy, but the manner of
choosing him, viz. in a mutiny, and without any respect to Gods will. Thus
Jeroboam (of whom it is conceived the Prophet Hosea speaks) was chosen King by
God, 1 Kings 11. 31. 35. 37. and 12. 15. 24. but the seditious and disorderly
manner of choosing him is attributed to the people.

Use.
IS Magistracy Gods Ordinance? This then first of all shows the vileness of
Papists who exalt the Pope above the Civil Magistrate, and give him power over
Princes, even to Deposition if they please not him. These must hold his basin,
Papa regibus tanqum suis vassallis suae^ potestati subjectis imperat, ut etiam
possit eos instituere and destituere. August. de Ancona de Ecclesiast. Potest..

bring in his meat, hold his stirrup, lead his Horse, yea be his Horses (I
might say his Asses) to carry him on their shoulders; and yet you must think he
is still Servus Servorum, or rather Diabolus Diabolorum, the Devil in his
Pontificalibus. He takes upon him to transfer Kingdoms, to excommunicate Kings,
to depose one, and set up another in his stead, and to loose subjects from
their Oath of Allegiance and Fidelity. They look upon Princes as mere Laics
and Seculars; year, V. Bell^rm. de exempt. Cler. cap. 2.
Bellarmine sticks not to call them Mundanos and Profanos homines, Primum locum

aliique Ministri Ecclesiastici; ultimum Laici, inter quos ^taim reges and
Principes numerantur. Bellarm. de Laicis lib. cap. 3. 17.
profane men, preferr^ng the Pope and his Shavelings before them. The
Magistrate must not Reform the Church, suppress errors, call Synods, nor
intermeddle with Religion. He may indeed defend it, but he must not See this
confuted in Gerhard de Magistrate. Tom 6. p. 305. Rivet. in Exodus p. 1038.
Judge of it, says Bell^rmine. Besides, he exempts his Clergy from the Civil
yoke, when Aaron the High Priest was obedient to Moses the Magistrate, Exodus 4.
15 and 32. 21. and Christ himself paid Tribute to Caesar, and yielded obedience
to him in Civil things; besides, the Injunction is universal; Romans 13. 1. Let
every soul be subject to the ^igher powers; i. e. every man, Siquis tentat
excipere, conatur decipere; si omnis, quis vos excepit ab Universitate? Bernard.
even all that have rational souls must obey. And it is worth observing, that the
more holy any have been, the more ^espectfull they have been to Magistrates, as
we see in Joseph, Nehemiah, David, Jeremy, Daniel, Christ himself, Mat. 17. 27.
John 19. 11. Paul, Acts 23. 5. 1 Timothy 2. 1, 2. yea and Peter himself, 1 Pet. 2.
13. It Is ture, the Papists do not in words deny the Office of the Civil
Magistrate (as some fanatics do) Yet in their works they do very much abuse
and abase him; by their distinctions of Spiritual and Secular, as if none were
holy and had the spirit of God but the Clergy, when the Scripture calls all
believers spiritual, 1 Cor. 2. 15. Gal. 6. 1. besides their setting the Clergy
above them, their exempting them from Civil Tributes and Taxes, their Against
Sanctuaries, see Pet. Mar^yr co^^ra Asyla, Loc. Commun. Classes 4. cap. 15.
Sect. 33. and G^rhard. de Mag^strat. p. 336.
Sanctuaries to preserve murderers from the sword of Justice, together with
their doctrine and practice of King-killing, does abundantly prove that Popery
is no friend to Magistracy; and that the Pope is Antichrist, that man of sin,
who exalts himself above all that is called. God, and carries himself as God, 2

years. The better an Ordinance, the more are its enemies; and though some of
these in words may speak honorably of Magistracy, confessing that God ordained
it in the Old Testament, and that ^its useful now to keep men in order, and
therefore we ought to pay Tribute to them: Yet what they build with one hand,
they presently pull down with the other, affirming that Magistracy is an Office
displeasing unto God, and unlawful for any Christian to bear; they would have
a parity and equality amongst Christians, they would have no Superiors, nor
Inferiors, but all fellow creatures well met; as that house is like to be well
governed where all are Governors, so that State is like to be well Ruled where
all are Rulers. As that body is a Monster which is all Head, so is that which
has no Head. Where all govern there is no Government, and where all are Head
there is Order.

These cry down the Coercive punishing power of the Magistrate, and so make him
a Mawkin or man of straw, or like a Wooden Head and Golden Neptune fixed on the
stern only for a show, but not at all concerned in the steering of the Ship.

2. They cry down all swearing before the Magistrate.

3. They cry down all going to Law before him.

4. They cry down all going to War under him.

5. So long as Magistrates please them, they will extol them (as the Arminians
did in ( Germany) but let Rulers once restrain them in their wicked practices,
and then they load them which reproachful Titles, as V. The seditious Standard
of the Fifth Monarch-men.
as Tyrants, Persecutors, the Powers of darkness, incroachers upon peoples
liberties, the Antichristian Beast, twill never be peace till it be down, yea
and they rise against them as the * V. Sleidans Commentar. lib. 10.
Anabaptists in Germany did against their Princes. These Anarchical ones are
men of loose lives, and this brings them to loose opinions, 2 Pet. 2. 10. These
lawless ones cannot endure that any should be Lords over them, Psalm. 12. 4.
They vote down Laws, Magistracy, and Ministry, Seductores isti non Dominos sed
Dominatum and ipsum munus a Deo con^titutum convitiis incessunt. Sibelius in
Iudam.
that they may the more freely enjoy their lusts. These are those Dreamers that
despi^e Government, 2 Pet. 2. 10. and speak evil of Dignities, Jude 8, 9, 10.
It Is not the Person so much as the Office it self that displea^eth these
Libertines. V. Mr. Oenkyn on Jude 8. p. 301, 302. folio.
These overthrow foundations ( Psalm. 11. 3.) and do what in them lies to ruin
States and Kingdoms. No Commonwealth can long subsist without Government, Ubi
non est gubernator, corruit populus* Vulg.
Prove. 11. 14. Where there is no Pilot, the Ship miscarrieth: and where there
is no counsel, the people fall; (...). A^istot. Polit. l. 4. c. 4.
even the wiser sort of Heathens have extolled Government and Order as an
excellent and divine thing; So that these Bruits sin even against natural
light. Ordo quid aliud est qu^m series quaedam superiorum and inferiorum?
There is a great necessity of Order and Government for the Preservation of
humane Societies. And no man fitter to Govern (all things considered) then a
Christian; he that has the knowledge and fear of God before his eyes, is
fitter to govern the people of God then he that wants it.

Woe then to those Seditious Quakers and profane Libertines of our time, the
vilest generation of See Mr. Baxters sheet against the Quakers, p. 4.
Railers and Revilers of Magistracy and Ministry that ever the Sun beheld. They
pretend to extraordinary sancitity, when they have not ordinary manners nor
common civility. If ever there were despisers of Dignity and Dominion, these
are they. In their words and gestures what Impudence, insolence and irreverence
do they show? These in Gods Dictionary are called Blasphemers, 2 Pet. 2. 10.
blaspheming Dignities, i. e. (...), blasphemantes cos.
they make it their work and Trade to go up and down libelling, muttering and
murmuring against those in authority. If God spirit calls Rulers Gods, As
Caligula was composed of Impudency, so are these of turbulency. Se nihil magis

Sueton.
we may easily guess what spirit leads those that call them Devils. It Is
dangerous to speak against any of Gods servants, and specially against his
servant Moses, Numb. 12. 8. Reviling of Judges is expressly forbidden, Exodus 22.
28. and therefore Paul takes up himself with an I wift not Brethren that he was
the High Priest, Acts 23. 5. And if the Angel would not revile the Devil, much
less may we revile Magistrates, Jude 8, 9. It Was a good faying of Memnon (a
commander under the King of Pers^a) when he had hired a Soldier to fight
against Alexander, the man began to revile Alexander; E^o te posco ut pugnes
contra Alexandrum, non ut illi maledicas. Plutarch in Apotheg.
friend (said Memnon) I hired you to fight against Alexander, and not to rail
on him. These like Beasts bite the hand that feeds them, and crop the Tree that
shelters them. They cannot escape the Revenging hand of God. Miriam for
speaking against Moses became a Leper, See Gods Judgments on such, in the
Theater of Gods Judgments, l. 2. c. 2. page 158 folio. V. Mr. Ienky^ on Jude

Numb. 12. 10. Corah and his company that rose against Moses, the earth

and Zimri had no peace that slew his Master. The opposers of lawful Magistracy
shall find their calamities to arise suddenly, prove. 24. 22. he that breaks
this hedge, a Serpent shall bite him, See the Large Annot. on Eccles. 10. 8.
Eccles. 10. 8. As God is the Author, so he is the Lover, Preserver and
Vindicator of his own Ordinance, and he will not suffer the Violators of
Government to escape ^npunisht, as we see by the experience of so many thousand
years; how many have still been heaving at it, and yet this Rock abides! they
thought to have overthrown it, but they have overthrown themselves. The calling
is Gods Ordinance, the person are designed by his providence, and the work
concerns his glory, and therefore God looks upon himself as deeply concerned in
their quarrel, and takes the despite that is done to them as done to himself,
Ex. 16. 8. 1 Samuel 8. 7. He will resist those that resist his Ordinance, and
rise against those that rise against his Vicegerents. Never yet any hardened
himself against God, and prospered. Let the Potsheards strive with the
Potsheards of the earth, but woe to him that striveth with his Maker, Isa. 45.
11. Though the Sons of Zerviah may be too strong for David, yet they are not
too strong for the God of David; though they be mighty, yet God is Almighty,
and will reward such evll doers according to their wickedness, 2 Samuel 3. 39.

An Answer to the Cavils of Anabaptists, Libertines, etc.
Objection I.
IT IS against Christian Liberty for Christians to be under the power of any but
Christ who is our only King and has made us free, John 8. 32. Gal. 5. 1. It Is a
sore slavery to have Magistrates and Laws to Rule over us, since in Christ all
are equal ( Gal. 3. 28.) and there is no Distinction of Superiors and
Inferiors, is of Rulers and Ruled.

Answer.
This is the grand Objection, the great Goliath, their darling; liberty,
liberty; liberty; overthrow this, and you overthrow all.

1. I answer. Civil subjection to Superiors may well stand with spiritual
liberty; for spiritual Privileges do not abrogate but rather confirm our
obedience to them. Paul that had so fully discoursed of Christian liberty, yet
often enjoins obedience to Magistracy, Romans 13. 1, etc. 1 Timothy 2. 1. 2. So does
Peter, (1 Pet. 2. 13, 16*) Had this subjection been opposite to our Christian
liberty, Sunt tumultuo si spiritus qui regnum Christi non been extolli credunt,
nisi a^oleantur omnes terrenae potestates; nec liberate per se data frui; nisi
quodvis humanae servitutis j^gum excusserint. Galvin in Romans 13. 1.
Christ would never have paid Tribute to Caesar, nor have commanded us to give
unto Caesar what is Caesar's. Gospel-liberty is a liberty from sin. (2 Cor. 3.
17.) not to sin; a liberty to serve God and not to despise the Ministers of
God; Christ never purchased a liberty for us to live as we lift, and hold what
we list, to be Arrians, Arminians, Socinians, etc. This is Libertinism, and not
spiritual Liberty.

2. Though believers as they are in Christ, are all one and equal, yet
considered as they are members of a Politic body and in civil respects, so
there is an inequality; and though Christ has freed us from the curse of the
Law, from the Traditions of men (1 Cor 7. 23) and from the Tyranny of sin and
Satan: yet he has not freed us from Subjection to men according to those ranks
and callings he has set us in: and therefore even in Gospel times we read of
Superiors and Inferiors, of Masters and Servants, with directions how they
should walk, and promises of Reward to such as faithfully perform the duties of
their places, 1 Cor. 7. 21, 22. Ephesians. 6. 5. to 9. So that Magistracy is so far
from hindering true Christian liberty, that it helps to suppress sin, and so
makes us free indeed. Neither is a Politic inequality against a spiritual
equality; Onesimus was as good a man as Philemon, yet for all that Onesimus was
Philemons Servant.

3. The Scripture speaks of Magistracy as a great mercy, and not as a misery or
burden to a people; it calls them nursing Fathers, Shields, Shepherds, etc. and
the loss of them is reckoned as a sore judgment, Isa. 3. 1. to 5. and the
restoring of them as a great mercy, Isa. 1. 26. I will restore thy Judges as at
the first. 2 Chronicles. 9. 8. it is made a sign of Gods love to a people. Let wicked
men and Sons of Belial call Government bonds and burdens. ( Psalm. 2. 3.) yet
believers of all men should be the most obedient to Magistrates (whether they
be good or bad) in all lawful things, of any people in the world, that so they
may stop the mouths of gainsayers, and all the world may see that Rulers have
no better friends then such as make conscience of their ways; See more in my
Comment. on 2 Timothy 3. 2. Page 31, 32.
for none can be truly loyal, but such as are truly Religious.

4. Though Christ be the sole King of his Church, yet is he not the sole Kng in
his Church; for Christ's Kingdom does not oppose but confirm the Magistrates:
they are not contrary, Subordinata non pugnant; nam in Ecclesia Reges Christo
su^mo Regi inserviunt, proinde Christus D^um and Caearem non opponit sed
conjungit. Mat. 22. 21. Dithmar. See more in Dr. Tailor on Tit. 3. 1. p 544.
but may well subsist together. The Gospel does not abolish, but establish the
Civil Government of the world and makes it better. Neither is our civil
subjection to earthly Kings any hinderance of our obedience to our Heavenly
King, but does rather evidence and confirm it. Christ was King of his Church in
the Old Testament (he was the same yesterday, that he is to day) and yet he had
Magistrates under him then, and why not now? yea he promises Magistracy as a
blessing in Gospel Times, Isa. 49. 22, 23. Revel. 21. 24.

Objection 2.
Gods people are an holy, obedient, willing people, and a Law to themselves.
But the Law is made for unholy and disordered ones, 1 Timothy 1. 9.

Answ.
Be you never so holy, you must obey; God will have every soul, be they never
so holy or righteous in their own eyes, Ius divinum quod est ex gratia, non
tollit jus humanum quod est ex jure naturali. Aquinas 22 ae. q. 10. art. 10.
to be subject to the higher Powers. In the Church of Rome there were many
Saints, and yet the Apostle commands them all to submit (in civil things) to
the Magistrates of those times who were professed Heathens and Tyrants.

2. The best are flesh as well as spirit, as we see in Noah, Lot, David; and if
there were not a Law without to restrain, as well as a light within, we know
not how far the best may fall; for though the just be a Law to themselves, yet
they have lusts still within themselves which many times call for coertion and
correction from the Magistrate. A good man says, as the Martyr said once at
the stake, when they went to bind him to the stake, That needs not (said the
Martyr) yet since I am flesh as well as spirit, you may bind me if you please:
So a good man though he has Gods Law within his heart, and he delights to do
his will, and so need the less binding; yet since he knows the rebellion of the
flesh and the deceit of his own heart, he desires as many restraints as may be,
to hedge up his way and keep him from sinning against God.

3. Though Gods people be holy and obedient, yet they are mixed amongst the
wicked, and so have great need of the Magistrates sword to defend them from the
violence of unreasonable men, 1 Timothy 2. 2. So that albeit good men should do no
evil themselves (though we see Doves many times and sheep fight one with
another, and have need of some to part them) yet they may quickly suffer evil,
if the Magistrate and his Laws do not protect them.

4. Though the Law be not made for the condemnation of the Righteous, yet it is
ordained for a Rule to direct and guide him. This Law he cheerfully obeys,
because it confines him to live in that element where he would live, as if one
should be confined to Paradise where he would be, though there were no Law to
confine him to it. So then the Magistrate is not a terror to him because he
does well, and does spontaneously obey his Laws.

Objection 3.
God forbids the killing of men, and says, he that takes the sword shall
perish by the sword, Mat. 26. 52. and has promised that in Gospel Times they
shall not hurt or destroy in all his holy Mountain. Isa. 11. 9. and 60. 18.
Hence the Socinians and gross Anabaptists gather, that offenders now must not
be put to^ death*

Answer.
2. God forbids any Private person to kill, Occidere hominem non semper est
criminosum, sed matitia non legibus occidere criminosum. Danaeus. Magistratus
non sunt ^^omicidae, sed malicidae, Bernard.
or to take up the sword by way of private revenge, without a call; but what is
this to the Magistrate who is a public person, and executes the judgment of
God on sinners, as his Vicegerent and commissionated from his so to do? for he
is the Minister of God for wrath to them that do ill. It Is his glory to cut off
the wicked from Gods City, and he has many commands so to do, Genesis 9. 6. Exodus
21. 14. Numb. 35. 30. to 34. Mat. 5. 21, 22. Romans 13. 4. Rev. 13. 10. So that
those who would have guilty persons spared, they dispute not against us, but
God, who has commanded that blasphemous and notorious sinners should be cut
off.

2. That Text speaks of Gospel-converts, not of Magistrates, and shows the
sweet peace and amity that in those days shall be amongst believers.

Objection 4.
The Lord was angry with the Israelites because they asked for a King, (1 Samuel
8. 6, 7.) Ergo Kingly Government is unlawful.

Answer.
Non sequitur; Est fallacia a dicto s^cundum quid ad dictum simpliciter.
for the Lord was not angry with them simply and absolutely for asking a King
(for Monarchy is not in it self displeasing to God, as we see in David,
Hezekia^, Josiah, etc. but for desiring to have a King out of an affectation of
Novelty, being weary of that Government which God had estalisht, Peccaverunt
quia petunt regem inconsulto, immo invito Deo; Deus enim instituerat Iudicum
Aristocratiam; hanc ergo ipsi in Mo^archiam mu^^re non debebant, nisi Volente
and. m^tante Deo, a Lapide.
and desirous to be in fashion like the Egyptians, Medes, Persians, Caldeans
and other Heathenish Idolaters round about them, ver. 5. and 20. and out of
ambition and confidence in a King as able to protect them, and diffidence in
God as unable to defend them in his own way. He was also angry with them for
their Ingratitude toward holy and industrious See more in the large
Annotations; and Weems 3. Vol. c. 3. P. 2. p. 12, etc.
Samu^l who had deserved so well of them, having spent himself wholly in their
service.

2. The Lord himself elected Saul to be King over his people, and qualified him
for his office, and expressly commanded Samuel to anoint him King over Israel;
which he would not have done, had that office in it self been displeasing to
him.

3. We may Retort this place on the Anabaptist themselves; seeing the
Israelites here in rejecting Samuel, are said to reject God, it hence appears
that Magistracy is Gods Ordinance, which whosoever opposes, that man opposes
not men but God.

Objection 5.
We may not Resist nor render evil for evil, Mat. 5. 39. Romans 12. 17.

Answer.
These places condemn not Ordinate and public revenge, which God has
committed to the Magistrate, who for good ends and without any hatred to the
person of any, is to do justice on them. So that albeit I may not offend
others, yet I may defend my self, and crave the Magistrates help who by office
is bound to execute justice on evil doers.

2. If they stick to the letter of the Text, this will take away the power of
Parents, and Masters; for they in their places do resist evils, and punish
offenders.

Objection 6.
We are forbidden to Judge, Mat. 7. 1. Romans 14. 4. 1 Cor. 4. 5.

Answer.
These places condemn rash, Est sall^cia a dicto secundum quid.
private, uncharitable and unseasonable Judging; they do not condemn Public,
Political or Ecclesiastical Judging.

Objection 7.
Magistracy belonged to the Jews who were Children (Gal. 4. 1.) and not to
Christians who are grown to perfection.

Answer.
1. Magistracy belonged to the Gentiles as well as to the Jews, as appears by
Nebuchadnezar, Cyrus, Alexander, Augustus, etc.

2. Christ himself approved of Magistracy in Gospel Times; and the Prophesies
of Gospel Times show that Kings should be servants to Christ and his Church,
Psalm. 2. 10, 11. and 72. 11. Isa. 49. 22, 23. and 60. 3. 10, 11, 16. Rev. 21.
24. even the holy City that comes from heaven, yet shall have Kings to Rule in
it and defend it.

3. The world is now fuller of people, and more wicked (all circumstances of
Light and Privileges considered) then in the Jewish times; and therefore if
they had need of Magistrates to suppress sin, and preserve Gods people in
peace, much more have we. The Devil is as busy, yea more busy now then ever,
and his agents as active to seduce us as ever they were amongst the Jews.

4. If man in the state of innocence should have had a Paternal and lovely, V.
River. in Genes. 1. Exercit. 10. in fine.
not Lordly subordination and order; surely we have more need of it in this
state of Apostasy; and those that talk so much of perfection, show no such
perfection, but that Magistrates are needful to make them better. Men are more
perfect sinners now, sinning against greater light and greater love then ever.
These under pretense of perfection bring in confusion; Dum fanatici A^^baptist^
perfectionem jactant, r^rum omnium confusion^m indu^unt, and perfectio^is
color totum Christianum orbem nituntur ^v^rtere. Zepper de legib, Mos. l. 2.
c. 5.
and if the Apostolical Churches (that had such an extraordinary measure of the
spirit) had yet need of Magistrates, and are often commanded to obey them, Romans
13. Titus 3. 1, 2. then it ^avours strongly of Pride and self-conceitedness for
any in our days to think themselves more perfect then those Primitive
Christians.

Objection 8.
There is but one Lord, Ephesians. 4. 5. and no man can serve two Masters.

Answer.
Though there be but one Primary, Principal, absolute Lord and judge, yet there
are many subordinate ones.

2. Our Savior does not simply say that no man can serve two Masters, but (as
the context shows) he speaks of serving two ^ontrary Masters, such as God and
Mammon, which command contrary things, and have contrary ways, ends and
principles; no man can serve two such contrary Masters. But Christ and
Magistracy are not contrary, but subordinate, and therefore the Magistrate is
called His Min^ster for our good.

Objection 9.
Most Magistrates are corrupt and wicked, of all the Kings of Israel t^ere were
not past f^ur that were good. They are most of them Tyrants and Oppress^rs,
they are briars and brambles, not Olives and Vines that seek for Kingdoms.
Judges 9. Ergo down with them all.

Answer.
This is like Anaptistical Logic, Est fall^cia Accidentis.
Because some abuse meat, drink, light, money, clothes, etc. Ergo away with
them all. Who knows not that the abuse of a thing must not take away the use of
it? Though the person may be bad, M^gistratus Esse^tialiter, intri^sic^, and
pe^ se (...) est;per acciden^, abusive and viti^ personae m^l^s.
yet the office is good. Judas was bad, yet the Apo^tolical Office was good. A
person^ ad rem non valet argum^ntum. Vitium personae non vitiat officium.

2. As for that Place, Judges 9. 1. It Is Allegorical, and so but a sorry
foundation to build an Argument upon. 2. It speaks not against Magistracy in
general, but against Abimelech who usurped* the Kingdom, ver. 1.

Objection 10.
2. C^r. 10. 4. The weapons our warfare are not carnal. Ergo the sword of the
Magistrate i^ useless.

Answer.
Non sequitur; for the Apostle does not speak there of Magistracy, b^t of the
Ministry, q. d. the weapons of our warfare who are in the Ministry, are
spiritual, not carnal; we do not look to prevail b^eloquence and fine speeches,
by ^lattery and dissimulation, or by worldly force and power; but by the mighty
power of the Gospel which is able (through the help of God) to pull down the
strongest hold of flesh and blood.

Objection 11.
John 8. Our Savior would not punish the woman taken in adul^ery. Ergo, the
Magistrate must not punish offenders.

Answer.
Non sequitur. It Was the Magistrates duty to punish such; See my Commentary o^
2. Tim. 3. 3. p. 103. 104. where this Text is fully vindicated.
but Christ having no Commission to meddle with the sword, let her go. But of
this elsewhere.

Objection 12.
The Magistrate is called an Humane Ordinance Ergo it may be pulled down by
man, (...) na creatio.
1 Pet. 2. 13.

Answer.
Non sequitur; (...) app^ll^tio ad De^n primum author^m nos r^vocat; ^^si enim
Magis^ratus crea^i. i. e. ordinari etiam ab ^ominibus dicuntur; primus tamen
coru^ creator proprie ^st solus Deus cui primitus omnis creatio competit.
Sibelius.
for Magistracy is called the Ordinance of man, or an Human creation, not
because it was invented by man, or has its Original from him; for all power is
from God; though men may choose the man, yet it is God that confers the power, and
commands us to obey him for his sake, i. e. because it is his will to govern us
by such. But it is called the Ordinance of man, 1. Subjective, because it is
seated in man, The substance of the Power is of God, but the specification of
the circumstances in respect of Place, Person, Title, continuance, customs,
etc. is of man. D. Sanderson ad Magistrate. p. 183.
and is managed by him* and the choice of the kinds of Magistrates is (for the
most part) left unto men, to choose what form of Government is most commodious
for them; that so they might more willingly yield obedience to them; hence some
have Kings, some Consuls, some Protectors, some Emperors. Now second causes do
not exclude but include the first; Regimen ipsum ^st juris divini; at
determin^tio ejus ad certar^ formam M^narchiae vel Aristocratiae pertinet ad
jus Ge^tium.
though men choose mediately, yet God orders and disposes all by his overruling
power to his own praise; so that in respect of their Original, appointment, and
Institution, See more, Lex Rex. p. 8. 9.
they are an Ordinance of God. 2. Objective, because it handles humane
affairs. 3. Finaliter, in respect of its end, it was ordained for the benefit of
man, and for the preservation of humane Society.

Objection 13.
Revel. 4. 10, 11. The twenty four Elders cast their Crowns before the Throne.
Ergo Magistrates (when they are converted to Christianity). must cast away
their Crowns.

Answer.
Anabaptistick Logic still!

1. The Text is a Vision, and Arguments grounded on Visions are very weak and
seldom demonstrative. Theologia Symbolica non est argumentativa.


2. The Text does not speak of Magistrates, but of the whole Church Triumphant,
Ad literam loquitur de primariis (immo de omnibus) Sanctis utrius^ Testamenti,
qui jam bea^i in Caelo vident, adorant and c^l^brant Deum. a Lapide. Coronas
suas ante thronum mitt^re, est certaminum suorum Victorias non sibi tribu^re,
sed Dco, ut ad illum referant gloriam laudis, a quo se sciunt vires accepisse
cer^aminis. Greg. Moral. l. 22.
represented here by the twenty four Elders, (for as the twelve Patriarcks in
the Old Testament were as it were the root of the Israelitish Church; so the
twelve Apostles by their doctrine were as it were the foundation and Original
of the Christian Church) who cast their Crowns before the Throne, acknowledging
all they have to be of free grace and mercy, not merit.

3. Suppose it did speak of the Christian Magistrate, yet the sense of the
place would amount but to this. That since Magistrates have received their
honor and dignity from Christ, therefore they lay all at his feet again, He
that would see all Cavils more fully answered, may peruse D. Featly, Dippers
dipped. p. 161. edit. 6.
giving all the praise of what they are and have, to him who was the donour of
them.

Use 2.
IS Magistracy Gods Ordinance? Then it will necessarily follow that a Christi^n
may with a safe conscience undertake that office when called to it; that Order
which is just, holy and good, must needs be pleasing unto God, and so may
safely be undertaken by good men; but Magistracy being Gods Ordinance must
needs be so: for all Gods works and Ordinances are honorable and glorious, and
do ennoble, not debase the creature, Psalm, 111. 3. As the Ministry is Gods
Ordinance, and Marriage is Gods Ordinance; so they are pure and good, and a man
may live in those conditions with a pure conscience, pleasing to God; so a
Pari, for the same Reason, since Magistracy is Gods Ordinance, a Christian may
lead a life pleasing to God in that Office. And the Examples of all those good
men that in the Old and New Testament have born that Office (as I have showed
before) and have been high in Gods favor, shows plainly that the office may be
undertaken by Pious men.

2. That which God has promised as a choice mercy to his people in
Gospel Times, the Administration of that cannot be unlawful; but such is
Magistracy, as has been fully proved before.

3. Is Magistracy Gods Ordinance? then none may usurp it, or en^er upon it
without a Call from him. As in (...) Ministry no man may take that honor to
himself but he that is called; C^^ gubern^tio ordo divinitus i^stitut^s, it ^
ad^o Deus ipse prasi gub^rnatio^i Politic^e, n^^ ^st (...) sibi arrog^re ill^d
imp^rium divinum, ant se ^udicem loco D^i co^s^i^uere Molerus in Psalm. 82. 1.
It Is not every man's work to Rule, but only such as are appointed (2 C^ron. 19.
5) and have commission.
so in the Magistracy none may assume this office to himself, but he that is
called of God, either mediately or immediately. ordinarily or extraordinarily.
As no man can preach ure and authoritatively but he that is sent: so no man can
execu^e Justice juridically and authoritatively but he that is sent. It Is true,
it may be some private persons may have abler gifts for Magistracy* then some
that are in office, yet may he in no wise exercise those gifts without a call;
and if he should condemn and execute a man, it is murder in him, because God
never commissioned him to such a work. As God was angry with Cora^, Dat^an and
Abiram for opposing Moses as well as ^aron; So he is the same God to the same
sinners still. As two things must concur to make a Gospel Minister, viz. 1.
Gifts. 2. A Power to execute those gifts. So these two must concur to make a
Magistrate.

1. Gifts and Qualifications sit for his place.

2. A Commission and Call to execute those gifts. Skill to govern, Power to
manage that skill, and will to actuate both, make a complete Magistrate.
(...), resistit ( Romans 13. 2) est verbum emphaticum, q. d. qui Magistratibus
resistit, contra ordinem divinum se quasi ordinat. Dithmar* Polit.
Let a man be never so well gifted or graced, were he as holy as Job, as wise
as Solomon, as learned as Moses and Daniel, yet without a call and solemn
designation to this work, he may not act as a Magistrate; or if he do, he can
look for no success or blessing from God in what he does. These fight against
God and cannot prosper; they break that rank and order which God has set up
in the world. It Is per me and not per se that Kings reign, Prove. 8. 15. it is God
that has made them Magistrates as well as men, and not they themselves, Psalm.
100. 3. Judging and Preaching are not mere acts of Gifts, but Office. Let every
man therefore abide in that calling wherein he is called; Tu supplex ora, tu
protege, tu^ l^bora. Let Ministers preach and pray; Magistrates defend,
Husbandmen till, and others do the duties of their place^, Luther.
for they are o^^times most insufficient, who think themselves most sufficient
for this weighty calling. Ambition is an argument of unworthiness; Ne sit qui
ambit, let not him speed that sues; let not those be preferred that would have
places, but such as places would have. It Is rebellious Absalom (2 Samuel 15. 4.)
and Tyrannical Abimelech that sue for rule. The fat Olive, the fruitful Vine,
and pleasant Fig tree refuse preferment; but it is the scratching Bramble, the
tearing Briar, an empty Keck, a worthless and fruitless shrub, that has no
shadow to refresh, but is full of prickles, good for nothing but to stop gaps,
and after to be burnt, which desires to Tyrannize over people, Judges 9. 8 to
16. Good men are modest, they know Honors are Burdens, and they will not
meddle with them till they be called to them. They that are worthy, must be
sued to; they are sooner found in retirement then in Popularity; as Moses
following I^thro's Flock, Gideon in the Barn, David at the Fold, V. Floru^ de
Gest. Romans l. 1. cap. 11.
Saul hid amongst the Stuff, ^ Sam. 10. 22. and ^ Lucius Quintius Cincinnatus
was called from the Plough to be Dictator.

4. This is matter of singular Consolation to Magistrates, that since their
Office is Gods Ordinance, he will defend it against all the rage of men and
Devils; he is the God of Order, and he will preserve it in despite of all its
enemies. As he calls his to Dignity, so he will keep them in it, V. Mr. Woodwards
Kings Chronicle of the good Kings of Judah. A Treatise wo^thy the serious
perusal of all Magistrates*
Psalm. 132. 17, 18. Isa. 42. 6.and 45. 13. as the Judgment is not yours but
Gods, so he will assist you in it against all Opposers, be they never so great;
Joshua 1. 5. 2 Chronicles. 19. 6. He that has set the Crown upon your heads, will
keep it there; if you uphold his Kingdom, he will uphold yours; if you be mind^ull
of Gods work, he will not be unmindfull of your reward, Nehem. 13. 22. Isa. 38.
3. Keep Gods way, and he will keep you, as he did Moses, Joshua, Hezek ah, ^^i^h,
David, Constantin^, (...) and others. Though you meet with many troubles, O^^is

run many hazards, and pass through many dangers and d^fficulties by reason of
Atheists, Idolaters, Libertines and all the rabble of Hell, yet in six troubles
the Lord will be with you, and in the seventh he will not leave you; he will be
your assistant in your labors, your comforter in tentations, your director in
straits, and your Oedipus in doubts; he will subdue your people under you, and
incline their hearts to obedience, Psalm. 47. 3.and 144. 10. he will give you Peace
of Conscience in the faithful discharge of your duty, and a Crown of glory
hereafter.

It Is very necessary in these Tumultuous times for Magistrates to be well
assured that their calling is from God, it will wonderfully uphold their
spirits in a time of trial. When Luther had writ a Book in defense of the Civil
Magistrate, and proved it to be Gods Ordinance, and very pleasing to him; when
Freder^ck Duke of Saxo^y had read it, it is said that for joy he lifted up his
hands to Heaven and gave thanks to God that now he knew out of the Holy
Scriptures that his calling was ordained of God, and that with a good
conscience he might now perform the duties of it. It Is an act of Dignation and
not of Indigence that God makes use of any to be Instruments of conveying his
blessing to others; ho^ agens liberrimum, he can do his own work without us, he
needs us not. It Is a great honor that he is pleased to employ us either in
Magi^tra^y or Ministry; when he has once invested us in those offices, and we
discharge them faithfully, he takes the despite that is done to us, as done to
himself, ^ Thessalonians. 4. 8. When the Israelites rejected Samuel, God comforts him
with this, they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, who set thee
as a Judge over them, and have gifted thee with graces for the faithful
discharge of thy office, ^ Sam. 8. 7. You are Gods more immediate Servants,
Ier. 27. 6. Romans 13. 2. the dishonor that is done to you, reflects upon your
Master: and if David so sharply revenged the abuse that was done to his
Ambassadors by the Amonites, ( ^ Sam. 10. 45.) let not the Levelling Ammonites
of our time who vilify both Magistracy and Ministry, think to escape
unpunished. ^ Sam. 26. 9. Prove. 17. 11.and24. 21, 22. Romans 13. 2. Magistrates
are called Fathers: and he that cursed his Father was to die for it, Lev. 20. 9.

5. Bless God for Magistracy. Every day we should be praising him for this
Ordinance; that we can rise in Peace, and rest in Peace; Travail in Peace, and
come to Gods house in Peace, and sit every man under his own Vine and Fig Tree
in Peace; all this and a thousand times more we enjoy by the means of
Magistracy, ^ Kings 4. 25* Micah4. 4. It Is these Mordecays that bring Wealth and
Peace to a People, Hester. 10. 3. Magistrates are the greatest Servants in the
world; they wake that we may sleep, they labor that we may rest in Peace;
Om^ium somnos illius Vigilantia defendit, omnium o^ium illius labor, omnium
delltias illius in^ustria, omn^um vacatio^^m illius occupati^. Seneca.
by them violence is suppressed, Justice executed, Religion maintained, and
humane Societies preserved, ( Psa. 72. per^otum. and85. 10, 11, 12, 13.) These
are (or should be) eyes to the blind, legs to the lame, terrors to the wicked,
Towers to the Righteous, Fathers to the Fatherless, Widows and oppressed.

Take away Government, and what would Nations be but Dens of Devils, Re^o^a
justitia quid sunt regna nisi magna Latrocinia? August. de Civita^, Del. 1. 4.
c. 4.
and Cages of unclean Birds? We see how wickedness abounds though we have
Magistrates to restrain it; but Oh the abominations that would be in the world
if there were no Government! What Idolatry, Nisirectores civitatum essent,
f^riorem f^ris viveremus vitam, no^ mordentes tantum, sed and vorantes alio^

Witchcraft, Blasphemy, Heresy, Murder, Theft, Atheism, Barbarism, Routs and
Riots, Cruelty and Villainy would overflow in all places? When there was no King
in Israel, then every man's lust was a Law, and they fell to Idolatry,
uncleanness and much wickedness, as appears, Judges 17. 6. and 18. ult. and 19.
1. hence the taking away of the Judge and the Prophet is reckoned as a sore
judgment, and the very inlet to Oppression and Confusion, Isa. 3. 1. 2, 5.and
24. 1, 2. Amos 2. 3. Hosea 10. 3. and 13. 11. Amongst all those heavy curses
which David calls for against his malicious enemies, this is the first, Let a
wicked man Rule over him, Sine imperio nec domus ulla, nec civitas, nec gens,
nec hominum universum genus stare, ^ec ipse mundus durare potest. Cicero lib.
3. de Legib.
Psalm. 109. 6. What Is an Army without a General, a School without a Master, a
Family without a Governor, or a Nation without Rulers? they need no foreign
force to destroy them, they would soon destroy themselves, Hab. 1. 13. 14.

S^obaeus tells us of a Persian Law, Persis lex erat, ut a morte regis, legum
and juris intermissio per quin^ dies fieret, ut intellig^rent subditi in quanto
pretio regem ac legem haberi deceat. Stobaeus Sermon. 42. p. 294.
that after the death of their King every man had five days liberty to do what
he pleased, that by beholding the wickedness and disorder of those few days,
they might prize Government the better all their days after. When Moses was
absent but forty days in the Mount, the Israelites presently worship a Calf.
In the Book of Judges we read of the death of Ehud, Gideon and their Governor,
and presently the people change their Gods, and did evil in the sight of the
Lord to their own destruction, Judges 2. 19, 20. and 4. 2. and 8. 33. Take
Government out of the world, and then take the Sun out of the Firmament, and
leave it no more a (...), a beautiful structure, but a (...), a confused heap;
without this men would be like Ismael, wild men; every man's hand would be
against his Brother, Genesis 26. 12.

It Is reported of Maxinilian the Emperor that as often as he passed by the Gallows
he would put off his Hat and salute it, with a Salve Sancta justitia! All hail
Holy Justice. Of all people Christians have most cause to bless God for it, for
they are exposed more to the malice of wicked men by reason of their profession
and principles which are so opposite to the ways of the world; so that they
are as Lambs amongst Lions, as Sheep amongst Wolves, as a Lilly amongst Thorns,
which would soon be devoured, did not the great Shepherd of the flock raise up
Shepherds, under him to defend it. These are the Ministers of God for our good;
1. For our natural good, for our lives. 2. Civil good, for our Estate. 3.
Mortal, for defense of us in goodness. 4. Spiritual, to protect the Gospel; and
this good is reduced by the Apostle to three heads, (1 Timothy 2. 2) Peace, Piety
and Honesty. They are a means under God to preserve the lives of us and ours,
our Goods, Sabbaths, Ordinances, and all that is near and dear to us: So that
when Government fails, 1. Order fails, 2. Religion fails, 3. Justice fails, 4.
Strength fails, 5. Wealth fails, Mr. Nath. Ward in his Fast Sermon. on Ezekiel. 19.
14. p. 9, 10, 11, etc.
6. Honor fails, 7. Peace fails: all this is abundartly proved by a learned
Pen. As where there is no Ministry, the people perish; so where there is no
Magistracy, the people come to ruin, Prove. 11. 14. These are Shields to defend
us, Fathers to tender us, Magistratus est illud vinculum per quod resp.
cohaeret est spiritus ille vitalis quem haec tot milliatrahunt, nihil ipsa per
se futura nisi onus and praeda, simens illa imperii subtrahatur. Seneca. de
clement. l. 1. c. 4.
yea nursing Fathers to carry us in their bosoms, Pillars that under God uphold
the world that it fall not into confusion, and the very life of the State, Lam.
4. 20.

How great then is the sin of those ungrateful men who vilify Magistracy, and
by consequence do contemn the goodness and providence of God to the Sons of
men! yea they contemn that which is the greatest glory and choice privilege of
a Nation. When David would set forth the glory of Jerusalem, he tells us, there
sit the Thrones of Judgment, i. e. there sit the Judges who administer justice
to all, and keep all in Peace, Quis cogitando, nedum dicendo consequi potest,
quam beata sit res sub bono and salutari principe vivere, qui and gloriam Dei
and salu^em reipublicae quaeral, augeat and conserve^? Dona sunt haec, and ut
Scriptura loquitur, benedictiones Dei opulentissimae. Luther in Praef. ad
Principes.
. Psalm. 122. 5. hence it is promised as a great blessing to an obedient people,
that they shall have Governors to rule them; and their eyes shall see the King
in his glory, Isa. 33. 17. Ier. 17. 24, 25. as it is reckoned for a choice mercy
to have our own Sons for Prophets (Amos 2. 11.) To be taught by strangers who
are called to the work, is a mercy; but to be taught by our own sons raised and
fitted for the work of the Ministry, that heightens the mercy; I raised up your
Sons for Prophets, of your young men for Nazarites; and as good Ministers are
promised as a special blessing ( Isa. 30. 20. Ier. 3. 15. Romans 15. 29.) so it is
promised as a special blessing that our Nobles shall be of our selves, and our
Governors shall proceed from the midst of us, Ier. 30. 21. Strangers shall not
rule over them, nor keep them in slavery, but they should have Governors of
their own, that would be tender over them. It Is a sign of Gods love to a people
when he gives them Rulers that will execute justice amongst them. 1 Kings 10.
9. 2 Chronicles. 2. 11 and 9. 8. when a people is but willing to obey, Violence
shall no more be heard in the land, nor wasting and destruction in their
borders, but he will restore their Judges as at the first, and their Counselors
as at the beginning, (Isa. 1. 25. and 60. 18.) and under them, shall all humane
abilities be improved to the highest apex and utmost excellency; all callings,
Laws, Learning, Valor, Religion, Arts and Faculties thrive and flourish with
much happiness and success under the wings and warmth of a Godly Government. Oh
then let us bless the God of Heaven who is pleased to Govern man by men; as it is
a mercy in the church that he teaches us by men like our selves, See more
Caryl on Job 29. 7. p. 476. 477.
so it is a mercy in the State that he rules us by men who are (or at least wise
ought to be) sensible of our Infirmities, and to whom we may have familiar
recourse in our necessities; if the Lord himself, or an Angel should appear, we
could not endure the sight; it is a great mercy and argues his tender love unto
mankind that he has set his own name upon our Governors, and adorned them
with the gifts of his Spirit, fitting them for such noble employment.

6. Since Magistrates are set up by God, it is our duty to Reverence them as his
Vicars and Deputies, Fear is of a Preservative nature, and makes men keep
within compass. (...). Aristot.
and that not only for fear of his wrath (which yet must not be slighted, Prove.
16. 14. and 19, 20.) but out of Obedience to Gods command, who bids us honor
them, Romans 13. 5. and joins them with himself, Prove. 24. 21. Sub honorandi
verbo sinceram ac ca^didam existimationem complectitur, and regem cum D^o
conjungens, sanctae cu^^sdam Venerationis ac dignitatis plenum esse ostendit.
Calvin Instit. l. 4. c. 20.. 22.
1 Pet. 2. 17. This Reverence must be
Cord, Ore, Opere.


1. It must not be complemental but Cordial; we must not once harbor an evil
thought against them; (...) God will find out a way to reveal and revenge it,
Eccles. 10. 8. 20. But we must pray for them. What if they be Heathens and
Persecutors, and neglect their duty? yet we must not neglect ours, Numb. 27.
16. Dan. 6. 21. Nero, Decius, Dioclesian, were Heathenish Tyrants, yet he bids
us pray for them, 1 Timothy 2. 2. and the V. Tertul. in Apolog. c. 30. Miremur
charitatem Pauli, qui pro tali rege vel po^ius tam impio Tyranno tamen
Christianos omnes Deum vult orare, nec pro solo Nerone, sed pro omnibus illi
similibus. Soto.
Primitive Christians prayed for such. Magistrates are encompassed with many
cares, fears, dangers and difficulties; we should therefore by Prayer hold up
Moses his hands that he faint not, and beseech the Lord to enrich them with all
graces fit for their places, as Knowledge, Zeal, Sincerity, etc. As every one
receives benefit by the Magistrate, so every one should pray for him, and bear
his part in this service; as those busy Idolaters did in their blind way, Ier.
7. 18. the Children gather wood, the Fathers kindle a fire, and the women knead
the dough, every one does something. Magistrates and Ministers of all men have
most need of our Prayers; Quo magis est abies procera, evertitur Eu is. Culmina
non valles fulmimina torta petunt. Verinus.
they are the common Buts against which Satan and his agents shoot all their
arrows; he overlooks small and great, and discharges principally at the Kings
of Israel. Many can Si tam prompti essemus ad preces pro Magistratibus
fundendas, quam para^i su. mus ad detrahendum ac maledicendum ipsis; nae res
nostrae melius haberen^. Bugenhad. See more Caryl Sermon. on Psalm. 72. 2. p. 30.

rail, but few pray for them, which makes things go so ill with us. Besides, in
Praying for them we Pray for our selves; in their Peace lies our Peace and the
Peace of the Churches; hence Gods people when they were Captives in Babylon,
yet must pray for its Peace on this very account, Ier. 29. 7. Besides, Kings
hearts are in the hand of God, and at the Prayers of his People he turns them,
Nehmiah 2. 4. Hest. 4. 16. and 5. 2. Job. 12. 24. Prove. 21. 1. Yea we must not
only Pray but Preach for them too. Titus 3. 1. men must often be put in mind of
their duty to Superiors; many look upon themselves as fellow creatures with
Magistrates, but God will have men know their places, and learn subjection.

2. We must give them Reverent and respectfull Titles. Aaron calls Moses, my
Lord, Exodus 23. 22. The woman of Teko^ calls David an Angel, 2 Samuel 14, 17. and
so does Mephibosheth, 2 Samuel 19. 27. They are the Fathers of our Country; and
he that curses Father or Mother, must die for it, Exodus 20. 12. and 21. 15.
17. Reviling speeches do rather exasperate then mend men. It Is our duty to make
the best construction of their actions, interpreting nothing Sinisterly, but
concealing their infirmities, and with Shem and Iaphet go backward and cover
them; we must not suffer them in their persons or actions to be traduced or
dishonored; but if we must (as occasion requires) lay down our lives for our
Brethren, then much more for the Fathers and defenders of the Nation, 1 John 3.
16. It Is therefore made the brand of Libertines and profane persons to despise
Government and to speak evil of dignities, 2 Pet. 2. 10. Jude 8.

3. By Reverent Gestures, uncovering the Head, bowing knee and making obeisance
to them, Imaginem Dei rex gestat, idique colendus and amandus est, si non
propter se, saltem Vocatioius and sunctionis suae causa. Aug. de Vet and N.
Test.
as Nathan and Araunah did to David, 1 Kings 1. 23. 2 Samuel 24. 20. So when
Joseph was made Viceroy and Governor of Egypt, they cry before him Abrech,
bow the Knee, Genesis 41. 43. Our deportment before them must favor of Humility
and not of Insolency, Levit. 19. 32. Job. 29. 7, 8. Eccles. 8. 3. Next to the
honor which we owe to God himself, we owe respect and ought to honor
Magistrates, by a prompt obeying their just and lawful commands, in The Laws
of men properly bind the outward man, the Conscience God reserves for himself.
Byfield on 1 Pet. 2. 13. p. 430, 431.
Civil and Political affairs, (1 Samuel 22. 14.) As our obedience to God, so our
obedience to the Ministers of God should be made known to all men, Romans 16. 19.
It Is reported of the Kings of Pe^u that they were wont to use a Tassel, or
Fringe made of red Wool which they wore upon their heads, and when they sent
any Governor to Rule as Viceroy in any part of the Realm, they delivered him
one of the threads of their Tassel, and for one of those simple threads he was
as much obeyed as if he had been the King himself. Yet the Laws of men do not
simply and per se bind the conscience, L^ges regum tum demum obligant
conscientiam, cum promulgant ea quae Deus praecipit.
but only derivative so far as they are grounded on Gods Law, and are agreeable
thereto We must so give to Caesar his dues that we rob not God of his See Mr.
Hieron on that Text, after Psalm. 52. p. 446.
, Luke 20. 25. for the Subject is not bound to obey in all things, but only so
far as Gods glory is untoucht. Hence the Lord punished Ephraim for obeying the
sinful commands of wicked men, Hosea 5. 11. and the Israelites smarted for
obeying Ieroboams wicked command in worshipping the Golden Calves, V. Woodwards
Kings Chronicle of the bad Kings of Judah. p. 87.
1 Kings 12. 29, 30. In this sense we may not be the servants of men, 1 Cor. 7.
23. It Is true we may and must obey their hard commands, Malo in malo non est

but never their Etsi pareadum in omnibus patri, in eo non parendum quo

sinful. We must so honor the King, that withal we fear God, ( Prove. 24. 21.
1 Pet. 2. 17.) and obey them in, but not against the Lord, Ep^es. 6. 1. Such
flatterers as obey their wicked commands, are great enemies to them, and help
to bring Gods Judgments on them. In such cases we should answer as they did.
(Acts 5. 29.) whether it be better to obey God or man, Contemn potestatem
timendo majorem potestatem; ille co^pus, hic animam p^rdere pot^st; ille
gladium, hic minatur Geh^^^am, Aug. Hom 6. de verbis Domini.
judge ye. It Is no dishonor to an earthly King to see the King of Kings served
before him; the Midwives are commended and rewarded by God for disobeying the
wicked command of Pharaoh, Exodus 1. Heb. 11. 23. We must yield Passive
obedience where we cannot yieild Active, as the three Chaldean worthies
submitted to the fire when they could not actively obey the Kings command, Dan.
3 18. We desire to give as much to the Magistrate as the word of God gives him;
and if any give him more, the more shame for them; there is more of flattery
then honesty in it.

render it as willingly, and pay it as cheerfully as if twere a free gift, Luke

wicked man, yet Christ's commands that Tribute be paid to him. Mat. 22. 21. The
state cannot subsist, nor Peace be maintained without great cost and charges.

Yet Magistrates must take heed of increasing the Taxes and burdens of their
people, when no necessity compells, but only to please their own Lusts and
Luxury; God threatens such, Ezekiel. 45. 9. Micah 3. 2, 3. Nothing raises
Sedition and Rebellion sooner in a Nation then such overreaching practices;
this cruelty lost Rehoboam ten Tribes at a clap, 1 Kings 12. 14, 16, 19.

and so far from sedition, that they quietly bear even the cruellest Tortures

Twere easy to show that none can be truly Loyal but such as are truly
Religious. Those that are unfaithful to God, how can they be true to their
Sovereign? He that fears not God, will never honor the King. Religion takes
away that ferity and brutishness of spirit which is in men, and makes them obey
out of conscience to Gods command.

Objection.
Were they good men, I could willingly obey them: but our Rulers are wicked men
and cruel Tyrants; they care not what burdens and Taxes they lay upon us; they
do not only fleece but ^^ay us, they tear our flesh and suck our blood, and
must we obey such?

Answ.
As Servants must obey not only good and gentle Masters, but also the froward
and perverse Heathenish ones, 1 Pet. 2. 18. so far as their commands cross not
Gods commands; so subjects must obey not only pious and mild Governors, but
also harsh and cruel ones, in external and civil things, usque ad aras, so far
as may consist with a good conscience. The Power is his, Potestas est a Deo,
sed non abusus potestatis Res ipsa saepe est a Deo, licet modus quo quis eam
assequitur no^ sit a Deo; sic divitiae sunt donum Dei, li^et modus quo avari
eas sibi comparant non sit a Deo. Gehard.
whatever they persons be; the office is his, however they came by it, and so
calls for our respect and observance. Even Tyrants are ordained of ^od for the
punishment of an ungrateful and rebellious people; when men grow weary of
Christ's easy yoke, it is just with God to put the Iron yoke of Tyrants on them.

commanded to be subject to Heathen Magistrates, to pray for them, to pay to
them, and to yield them either active or passive obedience, Mat. 22. 21. Romans
13. 1. 1 Timothy 2. 2. Titus 3. 1. 1 Pet 2. 13, 17. and if Tyrants were not
ordained by God, we must exclude his providence from the greatest part of the
world. But the Psalmist tells us that the Kingdom of his providence and power
reaches over all, Psalm. 33. 19. the Lord has prepared his throne, and his
Kingdom rules over all. All creatures are his servants; even the Devils in
Hell do Gods will, though against their own; and so do Tyrants and wicked men;
they often break the will of Gods command, and yet they fulfill the will of his
Decree. They serve his purpose and providence Materially, when formally and
intentionally they seek and serve their own, Acts 4. 27, 28.

We are apt to complain of Covernours; but who complains of his sins which
provoke the Lord to set up such Governors over us? Judges 3. 8. and 4. 2.
Peccatum populi Tyrannorum vires.
Job 34. 30. Psalm. 107. 40. Prove. 28. 2 Eccles 3. 16. Esa. 10. 5, 6. Ezekiel. 7.
11. Hosea 5. 7 and 13. 11. Let us therefore repent of them, and Judge our
selves; then will God make Medicines of these Poisons, and either turn or
overturn such as molest his people. Tollenda est culpa, ut cesset Tyrannorum
plaga. Aug.
As in nature, so in Government, nothing is permanent that is violent; so that
it is hard to see and Old Tyrant; although for a time they may uphold their
state by force and fraud, yet in the end divine justice confounds their
practices, and infatuates their counsels to their own ruin. Though they be
great, yet there is a greater then they, who will break them with a rod of
Iron, and dash them in pieces like a Potters Vessel, V. Mr. Hoodwards Kings
Chronicle of the wicked Kings of Judah, per totum.
(Psalm. 2. 9.) easily, suddenly, irrecoverably. Though men cannot or dare not
punish them, yet God will; if King Zacha^iah be wicked and draw Israel to sin,
Ad generum Cereris sine si^e caede and vulnere pauci Descend^nt veges, and
sicca morte Tyranni. Juven. Satyr. 10.
God will soon cut him off, so that he shall Reign but six months, ( 2 Kings
15. 6.) and Shallum that killed him (following his Idolatry) reigned but one
month after him, verse 13. and Pekahiah his Son, continuing that Idolatry,
Il^ed usu venit ut scel^rat^ssimum sequatur optimas Princeps; quorum enim
exitus perhorrescunt, eorum vitam imitori turpe and periculosum ducunt. Sic
Ne^onem Galba sequutus est; Ne^va, Domitianum; Alexander Severus Princeps
eruditus and temperatissimus, Hel^ogabalum non solum bip^dum, sed and
quadrupedum spurcissimum. V. Herodian. c. 1. and Bodin. Method, Histor. P 301.
reigned but two years, ver. 23. The persecuting V. August. de Civit. Dei. l.
3. c 15.
Roman Emperors were sixty three, yet only six of them died a natural death.
Usually God cuts off Tyrants suddenly, and raises up Pious and Peaceable
Rulers in their stead; after a wicked Ahaz comes a good Hezekiah, after
Idolatrous Am^n a zealous Josiah. After harsh King Henry comes mild King
Edward; and after furious Queen Mary, peaceable Queen Elizabeth. Thus after a
storm usually comes a calm, and after a sharp Winter a pleasant Summer.

2. As for Taxes, though they be great and grievous, yet the best remedy is
Prayer and Patience. Things that cannot be remedied with Patience, See more to
this Point in my Comment on 2 Timothy 3. 2. page 31.
must be endured. In 1 Samuel 8. 11 the Lord tells them what will be practice of
their King, not as approving or allowing of what he should do; for it is the
threatening of a judgment, not the Imposition of a duty q. d. This people shall
dearly rue the casting off that form of Government, which I had given them. Yet
under all their pressures there must be no rising, but only in prayer; They
shall cry unto the Lord, and acknowledge their sin, which is the meritorious
cause of all their sufferings* yet it is the wisdom of Governors to fleece and
not to flay the flock for fear of Insurrection. It Was good counsel which King
Henry the fourth upon his deathbed gave to his Son; Imperantis felicitas in
felicitate subditorum consistit.
He admonisht him to be moderate in his Taxes; for so long as English men
(says he) have money and riches, so long shall you have obeisance from them;
but when they be poor and in want, they be always ready to make Insurrections
at every turn.

Objection.
Magistrates are not only cruel, but careless; they neglect their duty, and
therefore I may well omit may pay.

Answer.
Yet this cannot excuse thee from doing thy duty; another man's sin will not
excuse mine; Recrimination is no Purgation.

2. If they are bad, yet better have a bad one then none at all; it is better
living under a Nero then a Nerva; where nothing is lawful then where all
things are lawful; Tyranny is better then Anarchy; (...).
the one keeps things in some order, when Anarchy puts all into confusion, and
makes every man's lust his Law, Ea quae vera sunt secundum tres, gradus,
(...)nullam admittunt disputation^m.
and set up as many Tyrants as there are slaves to sin, Government is de jure
natura; no Nation so barbarous, no time so dark but some footsteps of
Government might have been seen. The very Bees by the instinct of nature have
their King whom they acknowledge and follow, and the Cranes have a Leader.
Though the Nature of man being proud, loves not the Superiority of others; and
being licentious; loves not to be straightened by others; yet it teaches
subordination, and chooses Tyranny rather then Anarchy. The most unruly know
not how to subsist without a Ruler: even Thieves have a Leader amongst them;
yea and those Monsters of Munster that at first decryed Magistracy, yet when
they were once got into the Saddle, they quickly set up (such a one as he was)
a Tailor King of their own. Yea in Hell amongst the Devils there is a
Government, there is a Beelzebub, a Prince of Devils, ( Mat. 12. 24.) the Devils
who are the Authors of all disorder amongst others, yet have an order amongst
themselves. It Is ill with that state where men are left like the Fishes of the
Sea which have no Ruler, but the greater devour the less, Hab 1. 14. Where all
will rule, there is no rule; and where there is none to rule, there is all
manner of misrule, as Idolatry, Murder, Plunder, Thefts, Rapes, Riots and all
uncleanness, Judges 17. 4, 5. 6. and 18. 30 and 19. 1, 2. So that it is a very
bad Government that is worse then none at all; where there is Magistracy, some
may be oppressed and wronged; but none can be righted where there is none at all.
Better poor people should sit under a scratching bramble, then have no hedge at
all to shelter them from the storms of popular fury. Nebuchadnezar was none of
the best Governors, yet he was a Cedar under which the beasts of the field
found shadow; and the fowls of the Heaven dwelt in the bows thereof, ( Dan. 4.
9, 10, 11, 12.) And if a Heathen Magistrate be so useful, what is a Christian
one?

A sixth Observation.
We may lawfully give Titles of Honor to Magistrates. If God himself calls
them Gods, Shields, Saviors, etc. and lay upon them Majesty, Glory and Honor,
(Psalm. 21. 5.) why should any man scruple the giving of them such Titles? Away
then with those sottish Quakers who are afraid of being too respective (such is
their breeding) to Gods Deputies; and therefore they call them Thou Richard,
Thou Thomass, Thou John, as if they were talking to some Bearwards rather then
Magistrates. But the Holy Ghost has taught them better manners, and give
Titles of Honor to men in Authority; as King Agrippa, Most Noble Festus, Acts
26. 25. Most excellent Theophilus, Luke ^. 3 See my Commentary on 2 Timothy 3. 17.
Obj. 2. p. 296.
But of this at large in another place.

Caution, Prestat in (...) quam (...) incidere, q. corvi non saeviunt nisi in
mortuos, adulatores v^ro viventes devora^t, dixit Dio genes
yet Rulers must take heed of suffering Flatterers to give them Titles which
belong not to them, as Most Holy, Most Unconquerable, Omnipotent, Omniscient,
our Lord God, as Domitian and the V. Plura apud Laurentium in 1 Pet. 2. 17.
Obs. 4.
Popes of Rome are called by their Parasites. Thus James Naylor had blasphemous
Titles given him his Adherents, ar Everlasting Son of Righteousness, and Prince
of Peace; they sung before him Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of Sabbath; no more
James but Jesus, the Lamb of God a perfect man, etc. Against flatterers, see
Plutarchs Morals. p 69. Engl. and Aretius Problem. Chap. 2. p. 50. Greenhill on
Ezekiel. 22. 28. p. 296. Clerks Mirror. cap. 53. Ienbin on Jude 8. Obs. 6.
Death is Lot of such blasphemers, Lev. 24. 16. Dan. 3. 29. It Was the ^in of the
Persians that they honored their Kings with Divine Honor, as Gods. Let such
remember Herod, who for his Pride in suffering Divine Honor to be given to
him, V. Neyl^rs Examination.
was eaten up of worms or lice, Acts 12. 22, 23. God is very tender of his own
glory; what ever he parts withal he will not part with that, V. Q. Curtius
lib. 8.
Isa. 42. 8. when Satan began to call for divine honor, Christ would bear no
longer, but bids him Be gone Satan.

Observation 7.
The calling of the Magistrate is an honorable calling. God puts his own name
on them, they are earthly Gods, they judge for him, they bear his Image in
their Office, (...). Imago De^rex est animata. Menander.
they sit on his Throne, and he sits with them there. Though they be subject to
Infirmites, sickness and death as other men are, yet their calling is
Honorable; for the Dignity of Magistracy lies not so much in the persons who
are mortal, but in their Office, in that they are Gods Lieutenants on earth,
they sit in his place and exercise his power by Deputation; by him they are
appointed to execute Justice and preserve the Nations in Peace and Purity. Now
the Dignity of Magistracy will the better appear if we consider those Titles of
Honor which the Scripture graceth them withal; for whereas Libertines call
them Pests and Plagues, Persecutors, Burdens and Abusers of the world by
tyranny and oppression, etc.

Yet the word of God calls them
1. Gods. 2. Sons of the Most High. 3. Saviors. 4. Fathers. 5. Nursing
Fathers. 6. Heads of the Body. 7. Eyes of a State. 8. Servants of God. 9.
Shepherds of the people. 10. Healers. 11. Pillars. 12. The Lords anointed. 13.
Dignities. 14. Nails in the building. 15. Corner-stones. 16. Shields of the
earth. 17. Angels. 18. Foundations. 19. Signets. 20. Captains. 21. Rocks and
Hiding places.
1. The Holy Ghost calls them Gods, as we have seen at large before.

2. Sons of God, by Nature or Adoption, but by Office, of which see more on
ver. 6

3. The Saviors of the people, Judges 2. 16. and 3. 9. Neh. 9. 27. The Lord
saved Israel by the hand of Jeroboam, 2, Kings 14. 27. and of David, 2 Samuel 8.
3. Such a one was Iehosaphat, 2 Chronicles, 20. These God has ordained for Saviors
and shelters to his people against the rage and Violence of a wicked world;
hence it is that in their straits and exigencies they Appeal to Caesar for
succor ( Acts 25. 11, 12.) though many times the Remedy is worse then the
disease; and those that should be Saviors become D^vou^ers and destroyers of
Gods people; See D. Gouge his Arrows on Exodus 17. 9.. 40.^. 203.
but this is the abuse of their power. God erected them to defend and save his
people, that under them they migh lead Quiet, Honest and Godly lives, 1 Timothy 2.
2.

4. Fathers of the people, So Joseph who was a Prince in Egypt, is called a
Father, Genesis 45. 8. and Deborah is called a Mother in Israel, Judges 5. 7. The
Philistines called their Kings Abimelec^, Abimelech i. e Pater-rex, est nomen
Pictatis, Potestatis Charitatis.
i. e. the King my Father, Genesis 20. 2. and 26. 1. Psalm. 34. Title Saul was a
wicked King, Bonus Princeps non differt a bon^ patre. Xenoph. Cyrop^ed lib. 8.
yet David calls him, my Father, 1 Samuel 24. 11 and Job who was a Magistrate, (a
Judge at least) as appears, Job 29. 7, 8. and as some conceive a King, (though
his dominions might not be so large as ours now are) yet possibly such as in
those ancient times, and in those Eastern parts of the world were called Kings,
being a Supreme Governor within his own Territories, though perhaps but of one
single City and its Subburbs with some few neighboring Villages; hence he is
called the greatest man of all the East, Job. 1. 3. and when he came in
presence, the Princes and Nobles held their Tongues, he sat as chief, and
dwelt as a King in the Army, Job. 29. 9. 25. yet though he were thus great, he
styles himself a Father to the poor, Job 29. 16. and it was an high commendation
of Valentinian the Emperor, that his people knew not whether they had of him
Dominum an Patrem, -- Sed Roma parentem, Roma patrem Patriae Ciceronem libera
dixi^. Juven. Sat. 8. Homerus nihil aliud in rege desiderabat nisi ut esset
fortis in hosts, bonus in cives.
a Father or a Lord. In Rome of old the Senators were called Fathers, and it was
afterward counted among the Romans the greatest title of honor that could be
bestowed upon their Consuls, Generals, Emperors or who ever had deserved best
of the Commonwealth, to have this addition to the rest of his style, -- Cum
Patriae rector dicare Paterque Utere more Dei nomen habentis idem. Ovid.
Pater Patriae, the Father of his Country. This Title implayes not only Power
and Authority, but also tenderness, care and pity; they should carry fatherly
affections toward their people: as a good Father loves, defends and cherishes
his children, so will a good Prince his Subjects; he will not N^faria fuit ista
Neronis vo^, Me mortuo terraigne misceatur. Et illud Caligulae, Utinam Pop.
Romans unam haberet cer^icem quam semel truncare possem.
grind them by cruel exactions, nor drink their blood to satisfy his own lust,
nor suffer them to be poisoned with Heresy; when they cry for bread, he will not
give them a Scorpion; but he is more tender of his people then of himself, and
more sensible of their miseries then his own. Tarde sibi pa^er membra sua
abscindit, and cum absci^^rit reponere cupit, and in abscindendo gemit,
cunctatus multum diuque: Prope enim est ut libenter damnet, qui cito; prope est
ut in^ que puniat, qui nimis. Ser. de Clement. cap. 14.
In all their sufferings he suffers with them, he condoles their miseries,
redresseth their wrongs, relieves their wants, reforms their errors, prevents
their dangers, procures their welfare and happiness by all good means. Thus men
of public Places should be men of Paternal and Public Spirits: Such men need
no Guard; when King Agasicles demanded how he might be safe without a Guard?
it was answered, Praesint ut presint.
by behaving himself toward his Subjects as a Father to his children. Hence
Rulers are called the Arms of a people to bear them up and tenderly to lead
them, Job 22. 8 Psalm. 77. 10. Ier. 48. 25 Ezekiel. 31. 17.

5. Nursing Fathers, Varium multiplex studium denotat, quod liberali manu ab
omni illustrium hominum genere impenditur in Ecclesiam Dei. Glassius
and Nursing Mothers, Isa. 49. 23. Kings shall be thy Nursing Fathers, and
Queens thy Nursing Mothers. A most sweet description of the loveliness of
Magistracy, showing what tender care should be in them, toward the Church of
God; no Father or Mother shall be more tender over their children, to provide
for them, and to guard them and secure them from annoyance, then Governors in
Gospel Times shall be over Gods poor, helpless, Fatherless people. q. d.
Whereas Kings and Rulers of the world are now opposite to the Church; Though
they be not Fathers to beget thee, yet they shall be Fathers to nurse thee;
they shall carry thy Sons and Daughters in their arms, i. e. they shall
contribute their aid and assistance for the upholding and increasing of the
Church. Leyford.
yet in Gospel times Kings and Queens shall gladly take upon them thy Patron^ge
and Protection both in Temporals and Spiritu^ls; no Nurse shall be so tender
over their little ones, as they shall be over thee. Thy Queens shall be Saraes
(so it is in the fountain,) i. e. they shall be as tender over thee as Sarah was
over Isaac, who gave him suck; and as the Nurse out of love spares no cost nor
pains; but gives even her own blood to her babe; so the Churches Rulers shall
spare no cost nor care, Patet hinc, omnem potestatem Ecclesiae esse
cumulativam, non privativam in libertatibus quas Christus tradidit Ecclesiae,
etc. Apollon. Jus Mag. circa sacra. p. 30.
but will venture their lives for the Churches good. As God made several of the
Persian Kings Nursing Fathers and defenders of his ancient people the Jews at
the time of their return from Babylonish Captivity, as we read in Ezra and
Nehemiah; so we read of the Roman Emperors, as Constantine, Theodosius, etc.
that were Guardians to the Christians in their dominions. God would have
Governors to carry his people in their bosoms lovingly, carefully, mildly and
gently, Number. 11. 12. Hence it is that they are called Benefactors or gracious
Lords, (Luke 22. 15.) because of that bounty and beneficence which they do,
Principes v^cantur Nedebim, i. e. benefici, ( Job. 12. 21. Prove. 8. 15.) quia
eos decet clementia and beneficentia.
or at leastwise ought to show to their people, and are compared to a lofty
tree which yields shade for beasts, nests and habitations for birds, and meat
for all; Dan. 4. 20, 21, 22.

6. The Heads of the body Polick, and the Principalities of a Nation, Numb. 1.
16. and 14. 4. and 17. 2. Judges 11. 8. Titus 3. 1. and that 1. In respect of
sublimity, as the Head is the highest and most Honorable member in man's body,
so in the State the Magistrate excels others in dignity and sublimity; hence
he is also compared to a Mountain which stands above and overlooks the rest of
the earth, Mica 6. 2.

2. In respect of power and profit. As the Head commands the rest of the
members and directs their actions for the good of the whole; so the Magistrate
is set over his people to direct and rule them for the benefit of the whole
body; hence it is that Jeremy laments the loss of Zedekiah (the last King of
David's line, but none of the best) with that Pathetical expression, The breath
of our nostrils is gone, Magistratus est velut ^otius populi communis anima,
qua corpus ipsum reipublicae sustentatur and defenditur. Danaeus.
Lam. 4. 20. As a man cannot live without breath, so a Commonwealth cannot
long subsist without Government.

3. As all the members of the body will hazard themselves for the good of the
Head, so should subjects for the good of their Rulers.

7. The Eyes of a State. As the eye of the wicked watches his opportunities to
do mischief; so should the Magistrates eye watch to catch them in their
wickedness; to this end God has set up Magistrates to oversee the manners of
the people, and calls them eyes, Job 29. 15. Isa. 29. 10. The Lord has poured
on them the spirit of deep sleep, and has closed their eyes; but who are
those? the next words tell you. The Prophets and Rulers has he covered. The
Hebrew word which we render Rulers, is Heads, because Rulers are the Heads of a
people; and what is a Head without eyes, or having its eyes covered? Rulers
especially when good, are the light of Israel, and the beauty thereof, 2 Samuel
1. 19. and 21. 17. and 23. 4. 1 Kings 3. 28. As Ministers are called Seers, and
the eyes of the Church, 1 Samuel 9. 9. 1 Cor. 12. 16, 17. so Magistrates are
appointed by God to be the Eyes of the Commonwealth, to foresee dangers and
prevent them, Oculus in sceptro was the Egyptian Hieroglyphick of a Princes
Vigilance.
and to oversee the manners of people to amend them. Now as they should not
wear the sword in vain; so they should not bear these Titles in vain; they
should not be glass-eyes or wooden-legs; as those artificial limbs stand the
Body Natural in little stead, so do these the body Politic -- Stat magni
nominis umbra.

8. The Servants of God, Ier. 27. 6. Ezekiel. 29. 19, 20. Hag. 2. ult. yea though
they be Heathens, yet their power is Gods, and therefore he calls them his
Servants and Ministers, Rom 13. 4. 6. Neither is this Title any diminution to
them, but it is the honor of their Honors that they are Servants to so great a
Master, who is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords. The Angels those glorious
spirits count it their honor to be Ministering Spirits to such a Lord, Heb. 1.
14. and Christ by way of Honor is called Gods Servant, lsa. 42. 1. and 53. 11.
These are the great Servants of the Commonwealth, endowed with gifts of
prudence, fortitude, clemency, etc. for the good of others. Neither are they
only his Servants by right of Creation, for so all creatures are his Servants,
Psalm. 119. 91. Nor Secondly by Right of Redemption; for so the elect only are
his. But by special Delegation and Commission from God, by way of Eminency they
are called his Servants, because they are set to serve him in a more excellent
place. Now the more Eminent the Master, the more Noble is the service. No
Master like God, his work is wages, and such employment is high preferment. Quo
sublimior est ^loria, (...) major cura. Cyprian.
Yet this Dignity calls for Duty; for a Servant how great so ever he be, is but
a living Organ (as the Philosopher calls him) to serve his Master with all his
might; he works for him, he gets for him, he lives to him and dies to him, he is
wholly at his beck and service; so must Magistrates who have received their
power from God, spend themselves and all they have for his honor: for albeit
they are Gods amongst men, yet they are but men with God; the greatest Emperor
is but his Minister; They are Rulers over the persons, yet are but servants for
the good of their people. People must serve them, Qui imperat, ser^us servorum
est. Luther.
and yet they are the greatest servants. As it is the duty of all to serve them,
so it is their Office to serve all.

2. As Magistrates and Ministers are both (...), Servants, and have the same
Title given them; so it should mind us of that Harmony which ought to be
between us: we both have one name, drive at one design, and serve one Master,
though in different Spheres, and therefore we should as^ist each other in the
promoting of Gods glory in our places. Its a comely thing when the word and the
sword go together.

9. Shepherds of the people, Numb. 27. 17. Isa. 44. 23. Psalm. 77. 20. Ier. 6.
3. and 12. 10. and 49. 19. Ezekiel. 34. 23. Micah 5. 4. Zach. 10. 2.

They must resemble good Shepherds, I. In Industry and fortitude, as they are
exposed to wind and weather, enduring Summers heat and Winters Frost for the
good of their flocks, and venture their lives in their defense (Genesis 31. 38,
39, 40. Isa. 31. 4.) against Dogs, Wolves, Lions, and Bears that would worry
the flock: (...) Homer-lliad. b*
so must Rulers be industrious in watching over the flock, defending it from
the Violence of Wild beasts; he must not Tolerate seducers who are called Dogs,
Wolves, Foxes to destroy the flock of Christ, but he must drive them from the
Fold, and keep his sheep from the Poisonous Pastures of Heretics. The weak
Lambs of Christ he must carry in his b^som, and the strong he must preserve
from going astray; this is the meaning of that in Numb 27. 17. where M^ses
prays that the Lords people be not as sheep without a Shepherd, but may have a
Ruler to go in and out before them, i. e. one that may guide and govern them
both at home and abroad, in time of War and Peace* Thus did Moses himself; what
indefatigable pains did he take for the good of Gods people! he even consumed
himself till he had assistants provided for him, Ex^d. 18. 18. It Is said of
Agesilaus, that so great was his care of the public good that he could scarce
get time to be sick. God has set up Rulers for this very end, by good Laws to
guard his people, and by arms valiantly to defend them in their bodies, souls,
goods and good name from the Violence of unreasonable men. They are principally
ordained for the good of the Church; All is theirs finaliter (i. e.) the end
why God created all things was specially for the good of his Church; as
Ministers, so Caesar's are set up by God for the benefit of his people, who are
exposed to more dangers then other men. Shepherds are set for the safety of the
Sheep and not of the Wolves; and as for the punishment of wicked men, it is
principally reserved for the judgment of the great day, 2 Pet. 2. 9. the
defense of the godly is the Magistrates great work; This office will take up
the whole man. It Was the sin of the Bishops, that they would be Bishops in the
Church, and Lord-Keepers, Lord Treasurers, Privy Counselors and Justices of
the Peace too: and so between both, they were neither good Magistrates, nor
good Ministers, but deceived the Church, misled the King, and wronged the
State; of such Latimer complains, Since Lording and loytering has come up,
Preaching has gone down, contrary to the Apostles times; for they Preached and
Lorded not; but now they Lord and Preach not. They that be Lords, will ill go
to plough; it is no meet office for them, it be seems not their State, and thus
came up Lording Loyterers: and if the Plowman in the Country were as
negligent in his Office as Prelates be in theirs, we should not live long for
want of food. Latimers Sermon on the Plough. p. 19, 20.
Let such consider, 1. That Magistracy and Ministry are two distinct offices,
to be executed by distinct persons, V. Tilenum in Syntag. p. 2. Disp. 32. These.
33. and Amefi^ Medul. l. 2. c. 17.. 48.
(2 Chronicles. 19. 11.) in different administrations, having different objects and
ends; and therefore ought not to be confounded by us; hence the domination of
the Priests is reckoned as a horrid thing, Jeremiah 5. 30, 31. Ezekiel. 34. 4.

2. Christ himself tells us that his Kingdom is spiritual, it is not of this
world; and when they sought to make him a King he fled from them, John 6. 15.
and refused to divide inheritances ( Luke 12. 14.) or to sentence the woman
taken in adultery which belonged to the Magistrates office, John 8. 11. yea he
forbad his Disciples and their Successors the exercising of any Lordly or
Political dominion, Stetisse lego Apostol^s judicandos, non sedisse judicantes.
Bern. I. 1. de consid.
Mat. 20. 25. and Luke 22. 25. And if they might not serve Tables and see to
the Poor, because it hindered their studies, ( Acts 6. 2.) much less may they
attend Seats of Judicature which are greater impediments; Council. Eliber. Can.
19. Carthag. 1. Can. 6. 9. Calcedon. Can. 3. Constant. 6. Can 9. Mogunti^. C^n.
10. 12. Rhemens. Can. 29, etc.
besides they are expressly commanded not to entangle themselves in the things
of this world, 2 Timothy 2. 4. and this drownig themselves in secular offices is
condemned by many Councels.

2. In Tenderness over the flock. A good Shepherd does fleece but not flay his
Sheep; so a good Magistrate is moderate in his Taxes and Impositions on his
people. Many Rulers are Tyrannical Beasts, not Shepherds; hence those four
persecuting Monarchs are compared to Beasts for their cruelty, ( Dan. 7. 3. 7.)
when they should be Angels an^ Guardians to defend, they are devouring beasts
that have Teeth, great Teeth, great Iron Teeth (so is that beast in Daniel
described) to show what spoil and havoc he would make amongst the people. Of
such unnatural Shepherds the Lord complains, Micah 3. 3. Zach. 11. 5. such must
know that the flock is the Lords, not theirs; the people are the Sheep of his
Pasture, and therefore they are called His, by a special propriety, John 21.
15, 16. my Lambs, my Sheep; not Thy Lambs or thy Sheep. When Solomon prayed for
an understanding heart, it was that he might Judge Thy people (1 Kings 3. 9.) Not
my people to flay, Reipublicea salus suprema lex est^, and praecipuus scopus
quem sibi quilib^t Magistratus proponat. Plato de Rep. l. 1.
slay and destroy, but Thy people to be loved, fed, and defended by me Princes
are not set up to seek themselves, but their peoples good.

3. In Excellency. As the Shepherd excells his Sheep, Magistratu dignum non
esse qu^nquam qui non sit m^li^r subdi^is, dixi^ Cyrus.
so should Rulers excel their people. As Sanl was taller by the head and
shoulders then other men, so ought these to excel in Wisdom, Temperance,
Righteousness and Religion, that by their good Example they might lead their
people after them. ^gesilaus said well, A Prince must out-goe his Subjects, no^
in Lust and Pleasure, but in Temp^rance and ^agnanimity. So said Cyrus, He is
not worthy to govern, that is no better nor more virtuous then they over whom
be is to com^and.

10. Healers and Binders and Chirurgians, which bind up the wounds of their
people, and labor to heal ^he divisions which are amongst them; Chobesh,
liga^or vuln^rum, from Chabash to tie fast, because it is the part of a good
Prince to bind up the wounds of his subjects, the light of his countenance
should be as life to his people, and his favor as the latter rain, Prove. 16.
15.
hence it is that Job 34. 17. Isa. 3. 7. Rulers are called Hea^ers or binders up,
a Metaphor taken from Surgery, and the binding up of wounds and fores for
the cure of them. And Oh that the Rulers of our Nation would labor to make
good this blessed Title by using all good means for the healing of all these
sad Divisions both in Doctrine and Discipline, both in Principles and Practice.
Parliaments for the State, and Synods for the Church, are excellent Remedies
against exhorbitances both in the one and the other.

11. Pillars of a State, it cannot stand long without them. The world would
soon fall into confusion and shatter all to pieces (as to its civil capacity)
if the Lord had not founded it on the Pillars of Government, Psalm. 75. 3. I
bear up ^he Pillars of the earth, David a King was a Pillar that by his wisdom
and faithfulness did bear up the inferior Magistrates, whom he calls the
Pillars of the earth in a Political sense. These are the stakes in the hedge of
the State, which keep up the sense that the wild beast enter not* yea the Lord
looks at any one of them as able to make up a breach against him, Exodus 32. 10.
Ezekiel. 22. 30 31. Ier. 5. 1. If the Lord could have found but a man that
executed judgment i. e. but one faithful Magistrate in Jerusalem, he had
spared it for his sake. One Phineas executing judgment staid the Plague, Psalm.
106. 30.

12. Christ's or the Lords anointed, So Saul was called, 1 Samuel 12. 3. 5. and
24. 6. and David 2 Samuel 19. 21. Psalm. 84. 9. and 132. 10. and Cyrus though a
Heathen and one that had not received the external unction of Oil which the
Kings of Israel received at their Inauguration, yet being appointed of God to
do him service, this call of God was beyond all the external unction in the
world. Isa. 45. 1. It Is true the Kings whose choice had somewhat extraordinary
in it, were installed into their office by pouring of Oil upon them, 1 Samuel 10.
1. and 16. 12, 13. 1 King 19. 15, 16. and 2. 9. 3. See more fully our Large
Annot. o^ 1 Samuel 10. 1.
Now this Ceremony of Anointing signified that they were called by God to their
office, Ungere aliquem est eum tum mu^^eri alicui praeficere, t^m dous ad ill^m
obeundum necessariis inst^u^re; ita ut unct^o^^is (...) duo complectatur. 1.
Destinationem seu Vocationem ^d aliquod mu^ns. 2. Donorum ad munus illud
exequendum necessariorum collationem. Ravanellus.
and should receive from him all gifts and graces needful for their places.
Yet this Title is given to all believers, Psalm, 105. 15. 1 Cor. 1 22. 1 John 2.
20. 27.

13. Dignities, Glo^ies and Majesty's, Dominions, Principalities and Powers,
Rom 8 38 2 (...) gloriae.
Pet. 2. 10. Jude 8 all in the Abstract, put for men that are set in Power and
Dignity, and because of that glory and excellency wherewith God is pleased
eminently to adorn them. Though Libertines reproach them as Inglorious and
fools in Israel; yet the Holy Ghost for-seeing what spirits would arise in
Gospel Times, calls them Dignities and Higher Powers in respect of their
Superiority and pre-eminence above others, and in respect of those glorious
gifts and endowments which God adorns them withal, whereby they are fitted for
an honorable, fruitful and faithful discharge of their office, as wisdom to
discern between good and evil, clear apprehension, Magnanimity and Zeal. Thus
even Saul when he was made a King, was said to be another man i. e. he was
adorned with Prudence, Clemency, Magnanity and other Princely virtues fit for
his place, 1 Samuel 10. 9. and so was David, 1 Samuel 16. 13. These are the light
and glory of a land, of whom we may say as the people did of David, that he was
worth ten thousand of them. 2 Samuel 18. 3. and 21. 17.

14. Nails and Pins upon which all the burden hangs, and therefore they have
need to be fastened in a sure place, keeping close to the Rule of the word;
never till then will they be a glorious Throne to their Fathers house, Isa. 22.
23. Now the Magistrate is compared to a Nail fastened in a Wall.

1. For Stability and firmness; as a Nail driven into a Wall sticks fast, so
God will establish and confirm the power of Magistracy, that it shall be no
more removed then a Nail that is driven up to the head, which may be matter of
singular comfort to all faithful Magistrates, who must look to encounter with
many difficulties and indignities from an ungrateful world. But he that has
called them to their honor, will keep them there, and fix them with his own
hand, whilst they walk in his fear, doing justice and judgment, Prove. 29. 14.

2. In respect of Vtility; as a Nail that is fastened in a Wall is fit for many
uses; so a faithful Magistrate is many ways benefical to the people where God
has fixed him; and as Pins do fasten Tents, so these help to fix us in our
places in peace, in despite of Oppressors, Zach. 10. 4. and as the beams of a
building are fastened and united by nails one to another; So Magistracy is a
means to unite people together in Society and Amity.

3. In respect of the weighty labors that lie upon him. We know every one is
apt to clap somewhat upon a Nail or Pin. Arms, Utensils, Vessels, great and
small we use to hang upon the wall. So the Magistrate is usually loaded with
employment; every one comes to him for support, defense and succor. They lay
and leave their loads with him, all the necessary Utensils of the house hang on
this Nail. Upon it hang Vessels small as well as great; their Justice is or
ought to be as large as Solomon's wisdom which extended to the Hyssop, as well
as to the Cedar; Isa. 22. 24. They shall hang upon him all the glory of his
Fathers house, and all the Vessels of such quantity, even little Cups as well
as great Flaggons: all affairs, great and small, and all the weight of the
Commonwealth shall hang on him from the highest to the lowest. The glory of a
Nation hangs on the Nail of Government.

15. Corner stones, which laid in the ^oundation do uphold the building. The
man stress lies on the Corner-stones; Zach. 10. 4. out of him shall come the
Corner; What Is that? why the word is a Metaphor commonly used for Governors and
Magistrates, Phinah, angulus exterior aedificii, and per M^taph. Princeps qui
est ^obur po^ pali. Leigh.
1 Samuel 14. 38. Judge. 20. 2. where the chief of the people (in the fountain)
are called the Corners of the people. As Christ is the Cornerstone on which
the Church stands, ( Isa. 28. 16. 1 Pet. 2. 6.) So the Magistrate under God
helps to uphold the Commonwealth.

2. These help to Unite the building and keep it together that it fall not
asunder. As stones laid in the corner of a building where two Walls meet, are
thereby united, strengthened and supported; so Magistrates are the stay and
strength of a place, ( Esa 19. 13.) they are the strong Towers and Bulwarks of
a State. It Is true, all the stones in the building do conduce to the upholding
of it; Angul^s Metaphorice voca^^^ Pr^^ceps qui ^mpubI came continct, stringit,
prospicit and r^b^rat, ut angulas utrum^ pariet^m in dom^. Hie^om.
but the main weight of all lies on the Corner-stones; draw out these and the
building cannot stand. As Sampsons strength lay in his locks, so does the
strength of a State in these.

3. As it is an Uniting, so it is also an Adorning stone, it is an Ornament to the
building, because there is more labor spent in Polishing the Cornerstone,
then in the ordinary stones of the building, Psalm. 144. 12. Magistrates are
usually endowed with more choice parts and gifts then others, as I have showed
before.

16. Shields of the earth, Psalm. 47. ult. Isa. 21. 5. Ier. 51. 11. those which
we call Rulers, the Original calls Shields and Bucklers, Sit Princeps Clypeus,
non malleus.
Hos. 4. 18. Magistrates like Shields should protect Gods Sabbots, Ordinances
and people in their lives and estates from the violence of those Sons of Belial
which labor to bring all into confusion that they may the better enjoy their
own lusts. A Shield is for Preservation, it is a kind of Partition Wall between a
man and danger, See more in Dr. Reynolds Assize Sermon on Psalm. 47. ult.
it bears all the darts that are thrown at us. When judgments are abroad, they
should with Moses, Joshua and David by prayer wrestle with God, and lie in the
breach to turn away Gods anger from them: then God will be scutorum scutum, a
Shield of defense to such Shields of the earth.

Government is that Staff of Beauty with which God protects his people, Zach.
11. 7. it is called a Beautiful Staff for the profit and comfort which comes to
us by it. As the Shepherds staff is for direction, correction, defense and
support, even so is Government. 1. It directs a man that is willing to live in
Order, what to do, and what to shun. 2. It corrects him that will not be ruled.
3. It defends the poor and oppressed, and is a support to him who is wearied
out with hard dealing from men.

17. Angels, for Wisdom, Purity, Righteousness and Majesty. As the Angels are
Gods Messengers always ready to execute his will; So Magistrates must be
prompt and ready to defend the good, and punish the wicked according to Gods
Commandment, 2 Samuel 4. 17. 20. and 19. 27.

18. The Foundations of the earth, Psalm. 11. 3. and 82. 5. Micah 6. 2. If the
foundations be destroyed what can the righteous do? When there is no Law for
lewd and loose men, what can the Righteous do but glorify God by mourning for
the things which they cannot mend, and yet comforting themselves with this,
verse 5. that the Lord is still in his holy Temple and has his Throne in
Heaven, q. d though all be in confusion and we can see no help on earth, yet we
will look unto God for aid, who sees and considers the sorrows of his people,
and who can and will help them, when men will not. Magistrates under God are a
special means to uphold the world and keep it from running into confusion;
(...), fulcrum and fundamentum populi.
hence they are called Adonai, from Eden, basis (Genesis 45. 8. Isa. 22. 18.)
because like a foundation they uphold the building; hence Rulers and Valiant
men are called B^rrs (Hosea 11. 6. we read it Branches, Badim proprie rami sunt
arborum densiores and crassiores, parandis vectibus idonei, ^nde quidam vertunt
Vectes ^jus. Rivet.
the Original will bear both) which help to fasten our gates, and as the Ark
was carried with Bars, so the weight of the Commonwealth lies on these.

19. Signets or Sealing Rings which are near and dear to us, being continually
worn by us, Ier. 22. 24. Hag. 2. ult. With these we seal our cho^cest secrets
and ratify what we would keep safe, wearing them as an ornament on our right
hand, and giving them as Monuments to our intimate friends. Thus ^haraoh gives
Joseph his Ring, Gen 41. 42. and Ahasuerus gives Haman his darling a Ring,
Hest. 3. 10. So the Prodigal when he was restored to honor and freedom from
his swinish kind of life, had a Ring given him by his Father as a Testimony of
his intimate love to him, Luke 15. 22. In these also the Jews did inscribe some
name or character of that which they held most precious: hence the Spouse
desires of Christ, that he would set her as a Seal on his heart, i. e. that he
would further assure her of his love and confirm it to her, Pone^e aliquem ut
sig^ttum brachio vel cordi suo, est eum summo in pr^tio habere, vehementissime
amare, arctissime sib^ adjungere, studiosissime curare, ^overe, custodire ac
tueri. Ravanellus.
that she might be kept safe from her enemies, and never be forgotten by him,
Cant. 8. 6. By all this we see Gods tender care over Magistrates, and how he
accounts himself honored by them; they are as a Signet on his right hand to
him when they build his House, promote his Worship and defend his people.
Though they may be contemptible in the eyes of the Sons of Belial, yet they are
precious and lovely in Gods eye.

20. Captains, Guides, Overseers and Watchmen, 1 Samuel 9. 17. Psalm. 127. 1.
Prove. 6. 7. Mat. 10. 18. Acts 7. 10. 1 Pet. 2. 14. (...), duces and praesides.
As Ministers are guides and Bishops in an Ecclesiastical sense, because they
must see to the flock that is committed to their charge, ( Acts 20. 28. Heb.
13. 7. 17.) and lead them both by their light and lives: Vos estis Episcopi in
Ecclesia; (...) extra Ecclesiam sum constitutus, dixit Constantinus Imper.
So Magistrates are Bishops and Overseers of the people in a Political sense,
and must use all means that their people under them may live in Peace and Piety.

21. A Rock, a Covert and hiding place from storms and Tempests, Isa. 32. 2.
Ezekiel 28. 16. Nahum 2. 5. A man, i. e. a King, shall reign in righteousness, and
Princes shall rule in judgment. ver. 1. viz. Hezekiah and his Princes,
Hezekias ^rit ut latebra, rivus, Umbra.
yea all employed under any of these; for the meanest in places of authority
participate (according to their measure) of that which is here said of the
highest; every one that is set above others, may and must some way be a shelter
and refreshing to the afflicted. This the four ensuing Metaphors do excellently
imply setting forth the Beauty and benefit of Government. 1. Rulers shall be a
Hiding place and covert; these are words of Latitude, Rex pius est murus a
vento, Portus in tempestate, Rivus in siti, Umbraculum in aestu; heac multo
abundantins praestitit Christus, cujus Typus erat Hezekias populo suo graviter
afficto atque jactato a vento vehementiori, a graviori siti^, ab ardentiori
aestu Sanctius in locum.
implying any kind of shelter; by the fist we may understand a Wall, a high
bank, a thick hedge or great Tree, to any of which we creep in a windy day. By
the latter may be meant a house or haven to save us from storms either upon
Land or Sea; Wind imports lesser evil, annoying us; Tempests, greater mischiefs
quite overwhelming us: Both these Metaphors show that protection is part of
good Government. In the other two there is a further thing. 1. Refreshment in
inward drought, by Rivers of Waters which are very precious in deserts. 2. In
outward scorching heat, by the shadow of a great Rock, both most comfortable
and reviving to the languishing and tired traveller, almost ready to die for
thirst, or melted with the burning heat of the Sun, in those spacious plains
and uninhabitable deserts. This Text alludes to Gospel Times, Heac Historice de
Hezekia, Allegorice de Christo dicuntur. Aquinas.
and is fitly applied to Christ, but in the Letter it relates to Rulers and
Magistrates, as Hezekiah and his Underofficers.

NOW all these Titles of honor God has given to Magistrates to encourage them
against those discouragements which they are sure to meet withal in the
faithful discharge of their duty.

2. It should teach us to lament the loss of good Magistrates. If he that has
lost a good Father, Friend, Guardian, etc. cannot but mourn; how great then
should our mourning be for the loss of a gracious Prince in whom all those
Titles of love and respect do concenter and meet! When good Josiah was dead,
what bitter lamentation did the people make, (2 Chronicles. 35. 24, 25.) First All
Judah and Jerusalem mourn for him. 2. It Is with a great mourning; the
lamentation for him is put as the the highest President of mourning, Zach. 12.
11. Great losses call for great lamentation. The loss of godly Magistrates and
godly Ministers, are great losses, and therefore the Saints lay them deeply to
heart. When Moses was dead, the people mourned for him thirty days, Deuteronomy. 34.
8. when Samuel died, all Israel mourned for him, 1 Samuel 25. 1. yea when Saul a
wicked King and David's enemy too, was dead, yet see how he laments his fall,
and makes a Panegyric or Funeral Oration in his praise, 2 Samuel 1. 17, etc. So
good Ministers are spiritual Fathers, the Chariots and Horsemen of Israel, and
therefore we should lay to heart their deaths, Number. 20. 19. 2 Kings 13. 14.
Acts 8. 2. and the rather because it is the sins of a people that provoke the
Lord in wrath many times to remove godly Magistrates and Ministers from amongst
us.

3. Those Titles of Dignity do show Magistrates their duty. Let no man glory in
Empty Titles, but labor to answer them in obedience. ^t inveniantar in opere,
^nod signantur in nomine. Non sunt hic inanium figmentorum, sed rerum
verissimarum tituli. Musculus.
Let your lives and your names answer each other. Remember that God has given
you Magistratical gifts not for your selves, but for the good of others, and to
him you must shortly give an account of all the Talents which he has entrusted
you withal. Hearken not then to flatterers who would puff you up by telling
you that you are Gods, and Sons of the most High, and therefore you may do what
you please, you are to account to none but God; Where the word of a King is
there is Power, and none may say unto him What do th^^? Eecles. 8. 4. and
Samuel tells the people (say these Court-Parasites) that Kings have absolute
power over the lives and estates of their Subjects, 1 Samuel 8. 11. to 18. Thus
they make Kings glad with their ^yes, Hos. 7. 3. and are the worst sort of
Beasts; for whereas other beasts pray upon dead carcasses, those devour men
alive.

As for that Text, Eccles. 8. 4. the meaning is, that where the word of a King
is, there is power, viz. to punish such as do evil, and none can call him to an
account for so doing; and in this sense none may say unto him What do thou?
else the wicked actions of Kings may be, yea and have been reproved. Nathan
reproved David, saying, What have thou done? Elijah reproved Aha^ for his
murder, saying, What have thou done? It Is only Gods Prerogative Royal to do
whatsoever pleases him and to be accountable to none; none may say unto him
What do thou? Nulla potentia ^ida est, ^isit nimia. Sen.
Dan. 4. 35. The greatest men in the world are, or should be under Law. It Is not
for any man to say, Tyrannus dicitur (...) ^uvos, i. e. liber and immunis a
reddendis rationibus. Arist. Polit. l. 4.
( Sic vol^, sic jubeo, stat pro ratione voluntas.) My will's my Law; no Kings
themselves must read and rule by Law, Deuteronomy. 17.

2. As for that Text in Samuel, It Is the threatening of a Judgment, and not the
Imposition of a Duty. q. d. Deus h^c jus nec sancit, nec approbat, sed tantum
praedicit, ejusque acerbitalem graphi^e depingit, ut eos a Petitione Regis
qvellat. a Lapide.
This people shall dearly rue the casting off that Form of Government which I
have given them; for I will give them a King in my wrath that shall deal like a
Tyrant with them, taking away their goods and Cattle from them by violence, and
making slaves of them and theirs, as the Kings of the Nations whom they desire
to be like, have done to their subjects, ver. 9, 11. Samuel tells them, this
will be the manner of your King. The Court-Bishops render it Ius Reg^, Ius
Regis dicitur quod a r^ge non pro suo officio, sed per su^ arbitrio; non pro
aequitate, sed pro Voluntate institutum est. Mendoza in locum.
the Right of the King, and thereupon inferred that all the Subject had was in
the Power of the King and lay at his mercy. But Misphat Hammelech does not here
signify Right, Non h^c depingitur quod Reges jure possint, sed quid audeant,
and pro suprema potestate quam habere se p^tant, contra naturae leges and omnem
humanit atem Tyrannice decer^^nt. Sanctius.
or what Kings de jure ought to do, but what de facto they would do to satisfy
their Lusts of ambition and covetousness. This will be (their custom for so the
word is rendered, Genesis 40. 23. Exodus 21 9. 1 Samuel 2. 13. yet that did not
justify the wickedness of the Priests) not Right; for if Kings might lawfully
do all that is here set down, Cum leges praescripsisti aliu, praescripsisti and
tibi; siquidem naturalis aequitas postulat ut idem ius omnibus ex aequo
reddatur; ut Ambrosius ad Valentin. Epist. 32.
then Ahab had not sinned in taking away Naboths Vineyard by violence from him:
but this is expressly forbidden, Ezekiel 46. 18. and God punished Ahab for it, 2
Kings 21. 18. but the Lord commands the King to study his Law, and to rule
according to it, ( Deuteronomy. 17. 16, 17, 18. and 22. 37.) which is directly
contrary to this Ius Regu; Princeps dependet a lege naturae, divina and
fundamentali; quatenus homo est, dicitur observare legem naturae; quatenus
Christianus, legem divinam; quatenus princeps, legem fundamentalem. Maccovius.
for there the Lord commands the King not to multiply Horses. Ver. 16. but here
it is sad he will do it, Ver. 11. The Lord commands that he should not covet
riches, Deuteronomy. 17. 17. but here it is said ver. 14. that he will get their Fields and
Vineyards from them, and take their Cattle and Children from them, v^r. 14, 15,
16, 17.

Caution. Yet this does not debar Rulers from a Legal right over the persons
and estates of men both in times of War and Peace; Distinguendum est i^ter
temerariam regis cupiditatem and Reipublicae utilitatem ac necessitatem. Si Rex
privata libidine and habendi cupidi^ate impulsus talia fibi vendicet, injuste
ac Tyrannice agit; sed si Reipublicae salute and utilitate id exigente, talia
postulat, regia sua potestate merito utitur. 2. Distinguendum inter rem and rei
modum. Si Rex in hisce exigendis modum justum ac legitimum servet, and absque
violentia operas, decimas and tributa pro regni sui statu ac necessitate
exigat, non potest dici Tyrannus; si ver^ modum necessarium and legitimum
fuerit ^gressus, and ex subditorum incommodo suum duntaxat quaerat commodum,
potestate sua abutitur. Gerhard de Magistr.
provided they exercise it in a lawful manner, viz. for the promoting of the
public good, and the defense of the Laws, Religion and Peace of the Land.

Now as the Magistrates must take heed of Anabaptists on the one hand who
offend in Defect, and give him too little; so he must take heed of
Court-Clawbacks who offend in Excess and give him too much; Dum vitant stulti
vitia, in contraria currunt. Horat.
they make a God and an Idol of him for their own ends, Domitianus juberet de
se scribi; Dominus and Deus noster sic fieri ju^et. Sue^oniu^.
obeying his commands against Gods commands, and preferring great men's wills
before Gods holy word. Those cry up Kings as Gods, calling them Omnipotent,
Unlimited, Independent, not to be questioned by any Authority, etc. Thus the
Arminians (to curry favor with great ones, Errores Arminii qui coram suprema
curia dete^ti essent, ne Ecclesiis patifierent, omnibus modis allaboravit.
Pezel. Melif. Hist. page 1196. 1203. Walaeus Loc. Com. Tom. 2. p. 17.
and the better to supress Synods) supersuperlatively extolled the Power of the
Magistrate in Ecclesiastical affars; and this is the policy of many Sectaries
in our days to cry up Magistracy, that they may the better cry down
Presbytery, which they know would curb their errors and profaneness. Thus
Erastus a Physician, but a rotten Divine, puts all Church Censures into the
hand of the Magistrate, and so confounds Magistracy and Ministry together,
which are too distinct offices, having distinct bounds and duties belonging to
them, which they may not trangress upon pain of Gods displeasure: If Vzziah the
King will be so bold as to offer Sacrifice which belonged to the Priest, let
him expect a Leprosy for his pains, 2 Chronicles. 26. 18. to 22.

[See the Erastian Tenants fully confuted by the Learned Rutherford his Divine
Right of Chrurchgovernment. Chap. 6. Q. 2. p. 257. to 647. and in his Due Right
of Presbytery in fine, chap. 6. p. 387, etc. Gelaspy Aarons Rod blossoming per

L^ndon, p. 8, 9, etc. Walaeus Loc. com. P. 2. p. 3. ad page 73. Apollonius, Ius
Magistratus circa Sacra.]

4. Magistrates must take heed of dishonouring their Honourabse calling by
profane practices. Their lives should be an Epitome of their Laws. They are apt
to call for Duty and Reverence, but let them do their duty to God and honor
him, and then he has promised to honor them; but if they suffer Gods name to
be blasphemed, and his Worship, How men abuse their authority, See
Downamswarfar^ l. 2. c. 11. p. 486, 487.
Day, and Servants to be despised, he will cause them to be despised, he will
pour contempt on such Princes; Job 12. 21. Psalm. 76. ult. if El^es Sons be
vile, it is because they made themselves so by their wickedness, 1 Samuel 3. 13.
The loose lives of Rulers does detract from their authority. As a wicked
Minister cannot with comfort and confidence reprove another for those crimes of
which himself is notoriously guilty; So a wicked, swearing, drunken Magistrate
cannot with comfort punish another for those sins, whick riegn in himself. We
Princes (said Queen Elizabeth) are set as t ^ere upon Stages in the sight and
view of all the world; the least spot is soon spied in our garments, V.
Cambdens Qu. Eliza^. English, p. 325.
a blemish quickly noted in our doings; it behooves us therefore to be careful
that our proceedings be just and honorable. As Ministers in their calling, so
Magistrates in theirs are Gods Ambassadors, and represent his person; and
therefore they must do nothing unbeseeming their great Lord and Master. Since
God condescends so far as to Gift them, and grace them with his own name, they
must walk like Gods on earth. As Alexander said to one of his name, Nome^ inane
crimen in^mane. An empty name is a great shame.
Aut fortiter pugna, aut nomen depone. Either fight like Alexander or never
^ear his name. Loco ignominiae est dignitas in indigno, tanquam simia in te^to.
Seneca.
So say I, either act like God or never bear his name. Rule as God would rule,
Judge as God would judge, Punish as God would punish, and reward as he would
reward. As he has given you more Power and Opportunities of honoring him then
he has done to others, so he expects more from you then he has done from
others; for men to be called Gods and yet fight against God, Qu^ fiduci^
iniquitatem in tribunal su^ admittent quod Dei viventis thronum esse audiunt?
qua audacia injustam sententiam eo ore pronuntiabunt quod divinae veritati
designatum esse organum intellig^nt? Qua conscientia in impia decreta
subscribent ea manu qua^ ad perscribenda Dei acta sciun ordinatam? Calvin.
Instit. l* 4. c. 20.. 6.
to make Laws against his Laws, to use or rather to abuse their Power against
that God that gave it, this is to be Gods in name, but Devils indeed. What?
Gods and be Drunken? Gods and take bribes? Gods and be cruel and covetous, etc.
Hell is full of such gods. To such we may say as Naomi said sometimes in
another case, ( Ruth. 1. 20.) call me no more Naomi, i. e. beautiful, but call
me Mara^, bitter: so say I, call those no more Gods and Governors, but call
them Beasts and Devils.

Quest. But what must Magistrates do that they may resemble God whose name they
bear?

Answer. They must labor to resemble him. In nine Particulars,
1. In Wisdom. 2. Simplicity. 3. Impartiality. 4. Clemency. 5. Patience. 6.
Tenderness to the Poor. Gods name and Worship. Gods Ministers.
7. In searching into causes. 8. Judging justly. 9. Doing good to all.


1. They must get Wisdom and dexterity in their calling. As Ministers, Mal. 2.
7. so Magistrates should be men of Knowledge, Deuteronomy. 1. 13. Superiores sint qui
superiores esse sciunt. Bern.

time and circumstantiate their actions, See Dr. Seamans Ser* on 1 King. 3. 9.
Preached 1644. page 22.
( Eccles. 8. 5.) and thereby uphold the State, Prove. 29. 2. David was wise as
an Angel of the Lord, 2 Samuel 14. 17. Ezra must appoint none for Judges but such
as know the Law, Ezra 7. 25. It Is an art of arts, Ars est difficilli^a recte
gubernare rempublicam nullum enim animal homine morosius.
and a science of sciences, even one of the hardest works in the worlds rightly
to rule men. He had need be an Argus, or like the Ring in Ezekiels wheels,

full of eyes, Ezekiel. 1. 18. another Ianus to look forward and backward that he
be not surprised. Men are witty in wickedness, and subtle to smooth over bad
causes with fair pretenses; Psalm. 58. 2. and 94. 20. Job 13. 4. Jer. 5. 26.
Sinners are Impudent, and Innocence is modest and ofttimes uneloquent
So that if the Magistrate be not a very wise, judicious, experimental man,
they will easily escape the sword of Justice; hence Solomon is commended for
asking Wisdom, 1 Kings 3. 9. Qu^ honestior conscientia, iis plerumque frons
imbeci^^ior. Hieron.
It Is well observed that Rome saw her best days under her most learned Kings
and Emperors, as Numa, Augustus, Titus Constantine, Theodosius, etc. Plato
could say, Felices fore respublicas, si vel studia sapientiae consectentur
reges, vel sapientes imperent. Illasresp beatas fore in qua juvenum hastae,
senum concilia pollent, dixit Putarch.
An ignorant Ruler is like a blind Pilot that lets the Vessel be ruined on
Rocks and Sands. Hence it is set down as a sore judgment when Princes are
children, and Babes rule over men ( Isa. 3. 4, 5.) not children in years, but
children in discretion; then men fall to oppressing and wronging one another.
As bodily Physicians, Iustit a sit coeca in exequendo, oculata in dijudicando.
so State Physicians should have an Eagles eye, a Lions heart, and a Ladies
hand. Such as Rule others, had need to be well instructed themselves, that so
they may see with their own eyes. It Is dangerous for Church and State when the
Governors of it are ignorantly led by others, Debet Magistratus summus
religionem quam defendendam susci^it, etiam cognoscere, in eam inquirere, de ea
judicare, eamque prius judicio su^ non tantum apprehensivo, sed etiam
discretivc comprobare, etc. Hommus Disput. 30. 156. Ubiplura.
and cannot Judge of the things which are propounded to them. Hence it is that
the Lord would have them to Write, Read and Study his Word, that they might be
able to Rule according to it, Deuteronomy. 17. 18. which made Iehoia^a the High Priest
at the inauguration of King Ioash to deliver the Testimony or Book of the Law
unto him, (2 Kings 11. 12.) that by observing the Preceps and Presidents there
recorded he might Rule accordingly. He must know Gods Law, and he had need to
know the Laws of the Land too; else how will he be able to determine according
to Law, if he do not know the Law? The Scripture is the best Counselor for the
greatest Stateseman in the world. This is the way to make him See Mr. Strong.
31. Ser. page 617.
prosper, Josh. 1. 8. To this end they should get Godly and Learned Counselors
about them, that they may be able to resolve their doubts, and direct them in
Gods paths. It Is of great Consequence for Princes to have a Joseph, a Nehemiah,
a Nathan, a Daniel about them. Whilst Iehoia^a the Priest lived who was a pious
and a learned man, it went well with King Ioash and all his Kingdom, 2 Kings
12. 2. but when that good man was dead, all went to ruin. As a Minister must
not be a Novice left he fall into Temptations; so a Magistrate had need to be
an experimental, well-seasoned piece that he fall not into snares: and as a
Minister should have somewhat in him more then an ordinary man ( ex quovis
ligno non fi Mercurius) See more on Ver. 5.
ignorant logs become not Thrones and Pulpits; so a Magistrate should have
something in him that is eminent and exemplary, and something of an V. Langii

chap. 2.
and exhort men to Virtue. Julius Caesar got the Empire and held it by Arms and
Letters; hence he is painted standing upon the Globe of the world, holding in
his left hand a Book, and in his right a Sword, with this Motto, Ex utroque
Caesar, Emperor by both.

2. In Simplicity. God mingles with nothing; Nec timidi, nec tumidi. Male irato
fcrrum committitur; debet omni perturbatione liber accedere ad re^^ summa
diligentia tractandam, pote^tatem vitae necisque Seneca l. de. Ira cap. 16.
he is free from the mixture of a private or passionate spirit. So should Rulers
be pure gold without any dross (as much as in them lies) of sinful anger,
malice, fear, or hatred, Isa. 1. 25, 26. he that cannot rule himself, is unfit
to rule others.

3. Impartially. As God is no respecter of persons, but punishes sin where
ever he finds it, be it in rich or poor, ( 2 Chronicles. 19. 7. Job 34. 19. Acts 10.
34. Romans 2. 11. Gal. 2. 6.) so Rulers must imitate and follow him in their
measure and degree. Thus ^ maziah did justice on those that killed his Father;
he did not protect them by his Prerogative, 2 Kings 14. 5. and Asa deposed his
own Mother for her Idolatry. Of this see more in ver. 2.


4. In Clemency, Pity and Mercy. God is pitiful even to the Rebellious, and
loath (if by any means it might be prevented) to destroy them, Psalm. 68. 18.
Hosea 11. 8. He is not extreme to mark what we do amiss, but is slow to anger,
though he be great in power.

In this the Gods on earth must imitate the God of Heaven; Sit piger ad poenas
princeps, ad praemia vclox, N^m virtus magnos haec facit una D^os.
they must not oppress their brethren, Ezekiel 45. 8. nor rule over them with
rigor, L^v. 25. 43. they must not be like roaring Lions and evening Wolves
which leave not the bones till the morning, (...) Scipio laudatur, qui malle se
unum servare civem, quam mill occid^re dixit.
Zeph. 3. 3. but they must consider that they rule over men and not beasts, and
therefore they must deal tenderly and mercifully with them, ^enevolentia populi
erga Principem est tutissimum illius munimentum. Gerhard. V. Taffyn of
Amendment, l 3.. 51. p. 378. Diligi Princeps nisi ipse di ligat, non potest.
Pliny.
that they may get the affections of their people which is the best upholder of
the throne, Prove. 20. 28. David by loving compeliations wins the peoples
hearts, 2 Chronicles. 10. 7. Hear my Brethren and my people. So Theodosius by his
loveliness and clemency gained many Kingdoms: Joshua 7. 19.
The Goths (after the death of their own King) beholding his Temperance, V.

Patience and Virtue, gave themselves up to his Government. When Cicero would
claw Caesar, he tells him that his Valor and Victories were common with the
rest of his Soldiers, but his Clemency and goodness were wholly his own. V.

^ulti timent. Sen.
Nero in the beginning of his reign, when he was to set his hand to the
sentence of condemnation, would say Vtinam nescirem literas! I wish my hand
could not now write!

Rigor breeds rebellion. Rehoboam by his cruelty lost ten Tribes in one day,
Prima principis dos clementia. Calvin.
1 Kings 12. 16. Choose then rather to offend on the merciful hand, since (...)
much safer to account for mercy then for cruelty. Let the sword of Justice be
furbisht with the oil of mercy, Rex apum aculeum ^on habet, vel certi eo no^
utitur; exemplar hoc magnisregibus ingens. Plin. Not. Hist. c. 17. Caveat
Magistratus ne aut nimia severitat^ vulneret magis quam medeatur, aut
superstitios a clementiae affectatione incrudelissimam incidat humanita^em.
Calvin. Maxima peccandi est illecebra impunitatis spes. Cicero.
though there be cases wherein severity must be used; for we must beware of
foolish Pity which oft-times is mere cruelty both to thy self (it may cost
thee thy life to spare the lives of those whom God has sentenced unto death,
we must not be more merciful then the Rule which God sets us, 1 Samuel 15. 9.
and 1 Kings 21. 19.)

And Secondly to the party offending; impunity breeds Impenitency, it hardens
men in their sin, and oft-times brings them to a second murder, which the
indulgent Magistrate becomes accessory too. When one told the King of France
that such a one had committed a third murder; No, said one; he has committed
but one Murder, the other two are the Kings; for if he had not pardoned him, he
had killed but one.

Thirdly, it is injurious to the State to spare Murderers, Witches, and
Blasphemers; the guilt of those crimes lies on the whole land, and cannot be
set off but by doing justice on the offenders, Numb. 35. 33.

5. In Patience. God bears long with the Vessels of wrath fitted for
destruction. Romans 9. 22. he does not presently cut of rebellious sinners, but
waits long for their amendment.

So Magistrates had need to be men of much Patience, to undego those burdens,
affronts and injuries which they must expect (if they be faithful) from an
ungrateful world; as we see in Moses, though a holy, meek, wise man, and one
that had brought the people through many straits, yet when any new trouble came
they were ready to murmur and fly upon him. It Was a good saying of Theodosius,
If any man speak evil of the Emperor, Magni est animi in^ summa potentia
injurias pati, nec quicquam est gloriosius principe inpune laeso. Seneca de
Clement. l. 1.
if it be of lightness, it is to be contemned; if of madness, to be pitied: if
of injury, to be remitted. As he must in Aut f^r aut seri;ne feriare feri.
some cases use the sword, so in some cases, (especially in his own) it is his
glory to bear and forbear, Prove. 19. 11.

6. In Tenderness, 1. To the Poor. As God takes care of the Poor, the
Fatherless and the Widow, who have none to take care for them. Psalm. 68. 5. So
the Magistrate who has power, must be a defense to those who have no power to
defend themselves, But of this more. Ver. 3, 4.

2. God is very tender over his people; they are the Apple of his eye, which is
oculus oculi, tender, and the glory of the eye: the Signet on his right hand,
his Jewels, his Portion, his pleasant Portion, and^. So Magistrates must be
very tender over them; the world is apt to wrong them, and trample upon them by
reason of the Churches weakness; and therefore she is compared to a Vine, a
Dove, a Widow, as Sheep, which cannot subsist long without a defense and
support; and if Magistrates neglect their duty, yet God will never fail his
people, but will reprove Kings for their sakes; and though his Church be weak,
yet her enemies shall know that her Redeemer is strong. Ier. 50. 34.

3. God is very tender over his own Name, Day, Worship, Ordinances and
Ministers, etc.

So Magistrates as they are Gods Deputies, Prima Magistratus cura debet esse
religionem veram promovere, and impietat^m prohibere. Ames. C. Cons. l. 5. cap.
25. Q. 2.
must especially look to the things of God. As God has exalted them, so he
expects they should exalt his Name and Worship; Twill be the honor of their
honors so to do. This was the glory of those godly Kings of Israel, that they
made it their chief care to promote Gods worship, and to abolish all the
monuments of Idolatry. David saw to the ordering of Gods worship, that it might
be kept from confusion, 1 Chronicles. 23, 24, 25, 29. Iehosaphat sent his Princes
with the Priests to see Idolatry abolisht, and the Truth settled, 2 Chronicles. 17.
7, 8, 9. Hezekiah purges the Temple, 2 Kings 18. Josiah and Asa cast down
Idols, and restored the worship of God, 2 Kings 34.

Many would have the Magistrate to defend men in their Temporals, and see to
the backs and bellies of people, as if he were some Butcher or Oxherd, some
Turk and Tartar that never heard of God; but as for Religion (says the revived
Donatist of these times) that concerns not the Magistrate, Nec Prniceps corpora
tantum hominum curabit, and negliget animos; non enim a^mentarium aut subulcum
Principem fingimus, cui tantummodo Venture, caro and cutis subditorum cur^ sint,
Apollon. Jus* Mag. circa Sacra. p. 106.
he must not once meddle with that; Quid Imperatori cum Ecclesia? dixit Donatus.
whereas this should be his chiefest care. That which we must chiefly pray for,
that should be his chiefest care; but the great request of Gods people is, See
seven Reasons why Magistrates should more especially promote Religion, in Mr.
A^^. Burgess his Ser. on Judge 6. 27, 28. p. 5. etc. preached 1645.
that they may lead godly as well as peaceable lives under Magistrates, 1 Timothy
2. 2. hence it is that they are commanded to kiss the Son, obey his Commands,
advance his Kingdom and promote his Worship. Even Aristotle could say that
among other things the Magistrate ought to see to the worship of the Gods, See
five Reasons for this in Mr. Ienly^s Ser. on Psalm. 2 12. p. 6, 7 preached 1656.
and on Jude 8. Obs. 4. p. 3^0 sol o.
and that their holy things be kept from Violation. Mr. Perkius speaks well to
this point. The Magistrates (says he) look to Peace and civil order; it is V.
Ari^t. Po^^^. ^. 6. c. 8.
well done; and it is their duty; yet not the Principal; and they do commonly
fail in this, that they use not the sword for this end, to urge men to the
keeping of the comma^dments of the first T^ble, to a practice of pure religion,
and to the kee^ing of the Sabbath day. This is the main duty of the Magistrate,
who bears the sword especially for the good of men's souls. Thus that worthy and
eminent light of England.

2. If men be obstinate, the Magistrate may and must compel them to keep the
Sabbath, and to frequent the Worship of God; See Mr. Rutherfords Due Rights of
Presbyt. p. 352. in sine libri.
though he cannot make them believe, yet he may make them hear. Parents may and
ought to do thus much, and why not Magistrates then? Formido (...) licet non
reddat justos, utilis tamen est and servit tranqaillitati publicae, dum
co^^itus reproborum per ill^m coerce ^ur. Musculus*
( Exodus 2, 0. 10.) though they cannot compel them to grace yet they may to
the means of grace. The Magistrate is Ensifer Dei, Gods Sword Bearer, he must
not bear or wear it for a a show, (Romans 13. 4.) but draw it out and use it
according as God directs him in his word, bringing the wheel of justice over
the heads of the wicked; Prove. 20. 8, 26. He must not be like a Cipher, of no
use but to fill a place; like St. George on Horseback who sits with a drawn
Sword, but never stirs nor strikes; nor like that Log of Wood which Jupiter
threw amongst the Frogs to be their King, which they soon trampled on with
contempt. A Magistrate couchant makes offenders rampant; sin and error loose
nothing by Indulgence; such ill weeds (if tolerated) grow apace.

3. If they be Seducing Heretics, he must punish them according to their
demerits. Evil doers are to be punished (that is confessed on all hands) but
seducing Heretics are evil doers ( Phil. 3. 2. and 2 Pet. 2. 14.) 2. Murder,
Adultery, Theft, and such like works of the flesh must be punished; but Heresy
is spiritual murder, adultery, theft, and expressly called a work of the flesh,
Gal 5. 19, 20, 21. and least any should think that this was Legal, it is plain
that such ought tbe punished even in Gospel Times. Zach. 13. 3. The prophet
there speaking of Gospel Times, tells us that he who speaks lies in in the name
of the Lord, shall die for it. 2. If they be Idolaters or blasphemers, then it is
de jure naturae, agreeable even to natural light, and founded on Reasons of
immutable equity, as the glory of God, the good of his people, etc. that they
should be punished, and so binds for ever. Job tells us that Idolatry is a sin
to be punished by the Judges, Job 31. 27, 28. The V. Pezelii Harmon. Remonstr.
and Socinian* art* 21. p. 252.
Arminians and Socinians would have no Heretics punished or once molested by
the Magistrate (that so themselves might escape in that crowd.) But what
mischief and confusion this would bring to Church and State, I have See my
Commentary on ^ Tim. 3. 8. p. 168, 169.
elsewhere showed at Large. Indulgence breeds Insolence and Impudence (as we
have seen by sad experience) When Judgment is not speedily executed on evil
doers, Impunitas incuriae soboles, insole^tiae matter, radix impudentiae,
trangressionum nutrix. Bern. de consid. lib. 4.
they are hardened and heightened in sin, Eccles. 8. 11. Execution is the life of
the Law: it is the same in Policy, which Elocution is in Oratory, the first,
second, third thing, it is all in all. When the woman came to Philip King of
Macedon for justice, he answered Nolo, I will not; but she well replied, Noli
ergo regnare, Lay aside your king-ship then. So say I, will you not punish
Blasphemers and Soulmurderers? then never bear the sword of justice. Either act
like Magistrates, or never bear the office; either discharge the duties of your
place, or leave it to such as will; for shame let not blasphemy escape better
then Felony, let not a Cutpurse die and a blasphemer live. Do not punish him
that speaks a word against you, and let him escape scot-free that speaks two
against Christ. It Is a Sin to be calm and cold when God is blasphemed. When
Servetus that blasphemous Heretic charged Melancthon with harshness in a
dispute against him, he answered, In aliis mitis sum; cum blasphematur nomen
Christi, non ita. I can be calm (said Melancthon in other cases, but not in
blasphemy. And whereas many plead conscience for what they hold, it is against
their conscience to renounce such errors, and such Heresies; Mr. Buroughs
shall answer them; V. Buroughs Irenicum Chap. 6. p. 34.


1. An erroneous conscience does not bind; you sin notwithstanding your
conscience bids you do it. V. D. Bolton Arraignement of error, p. 337, etc.


2. Whatsoever you hold, though conscience be never so much taken with it, if
it destroy the power of godliness, if this man be in Christian Society, after
all means used to reduce him, if he still persevere in it, he is
(notwithstanding his conscience) to be cast out; if poison be got into a glass,
and you cannot wash it out, the poison and glass too is be thrown into the sink.

3. If the error with the profession of it be destructive to the State, and he
cannot be reclaimed; he may likewise be cut off from it, or at least be
deprived of the privileges of it, and benefits by it, notwithstanding his plea
of conscience. Thus he, who yet allows too much liberty in some cases.

Objection, This is persecution.

Answer. Not at all; It Is justice, not persecution to punish Thieves and
Murderers. These spiritual Thieves and Murderers are the worst of sinners;
others destroy but the estate or body, these kill souls.

2 Its Christian wisdom to kill Serpents, Wolves, Foxes, Bears, Cant. 2. 15.

3. It Is love and compassion to the souls of the wicked, Nemo pcreat, ni^^ quem
perire ctiam pereuntis int^rsit. Seneca. H^ereticis obstinatis b^^eficium est
morte multari; n^m quo diutius vivunt, co plures errores excogitant, plures
pervertuat, and majorem sioi damnationem acquirunt. Musculus.
and may be a means to convert, or at least to restrain them, and so they may
be the Ministers of God for their good, not only civil but spiritual; hence the
Magistrate is called an heir of restraint, (Judges 18. 7.) there was no
Magistrate (or as it is in the fountain, Ior^sh gnetzer) there was no heir of
restraint to repress sin, and restrain men from wickedness. Haeres interdicti
vel prohibitio^is* Piscat.
Thus Saul's reigning was called restraining ( 1 Samuel 9. 17.) because by his
authority he restrained men from their licentious practices. He must restrain
1. Idolaters. 2. Seducing Sectmakers. 3. Vicious livers. V. Mr. Lysords Scr^on
Dan. 3. 14. p 7, 8, etc.
When these Curbs are gone, horses run wild, and people are like Sons of Beli^l
without a yoke.

4. It Is an act of mercy to others to keep them from infection; it is cruelty to
the good to spare the bad.

5. Had these Seducers and their followers power, they would be the greatest
Tyrants and Persecutors in the world; witness John a Leyden and his fraternity.

6. I would have all mild and gentle means used before men proceed to
Judgment. Cuncta prius tentand^, etc. V. Dr. Boltons Arraignment of error, p.
334, etc.
Care should be taken to inform their judgments and convince them of their
evil ways. The Apostle is for two admonitions before Church censure, ( Titus
3. 10.) and the censure of the Magistrate should not precede that of the
Church. And if they be Heathens and Infidels, the gentler we must deal with
them to win them to the Faith, Ad fiden nullus infidelis cogendus est; nam ea
suadend^, non imperanda; dectores non tortores adhibendi: mon^ndo plus
proficitur quam minando, docendo quam caedendo. Tilenus Syntag. p. 634.
Titus 3. 2, 3. Abominable then is that cruelty of the Papists, who by inhumane
tortures would force the poor Indians to baptize their Infants, and say as they
say, and hold what they hold. All this is but a nullity; for as a forced
marriage is no marriage, a forced profession is no profession. Quod cor
nonfacit, non fit.


7. We must distinguish of Persons and their errors: 1. Some are Seaucers See
this question largely debated by Gerhard de Magist. p. 385, etc. Mr. Cobbet of
Magistracy. Mr. Leigh in his Prolegomena to his Body of Divinity, in fine. The
Author of the Blo^dy Tenent would have none punished. See him confuted by Mr.
Bedford against Antinom. p. 78. and Mr. Cotton against Williams. Davenant de
Iudice, p. 72. and Tactica Sacra lib. 2. cap. 2.. 11. p. 123, etc.
and offend through wilfulness; though they be convinced, yet they will not be
convinced, but walk turbulently and disorderly, disquieting both Church and
State; these must be most sharply dealt withal.

2. Others are Seduced and misled through weakness; these would be pitied.

Next we must distinguish of errors. 1. Some are about Circumstantials and
lesser matters, making no rent in Church or State, and here the strong must
bear with the weak, Romans 15. 1. Ephesians. 4. 2. Galat. 6. 1. That friends might
differ about the same things without breach of friendship, a very Heathens
affirms.

2. Some errors are fundamental and overthrow the very substantials and
foundation of religion, Non eadem sentire d^os de rebus iisdem, Incolumi licuit
semper amicitia.
directly or indirectly, M^gistratus propter solum baerescos crimen non
quenquam occidat, nisi forte horendae atque intolerandae in Deum blasphemiae,
vel manifestae seditionis crimen accedat Hommius Disp 31.. 4. p. 163.
mediatealy or immediately; Thus Arrians, Socinians, Antinomians, Papists
publishing blasphemy to the disturbance of Church and State; such Poe^^^
capitali puniri potest non qua erro, sed qua Turbo. Prideaux.
^urbulent Idolaters, and gross Heretics (as well as other gross offenders)
may be punished with death as appears, Exodus 22. 20. Lev. 24. 16. Numb. 15. 30,
31. Deuteronomy. 13. 1. to 10. 1 Kings 18. 40. 2 Kings 23. 20. Ezra 6. 11. and 7. 26.
Dan 3. 29. So says Mr. Perkins, Haereticos, blasphemos and seductores capite
mulctandos esse, multis argumentis probat doctis. Altingius, Problem 19, 20.
and Zepper. de Lege Mosaica. lib. 4. cap. 3. p. 244.
The Magistrate who is the Vicegerent of the Lord, is the Keeper of both
Table^, and therefore is to maintain Religion with the sw^rd; and so may put to
death Atheists, which hold there is no God, of which sort there are many in
these days: and Heretics which maliciously maintain and hold any thing that
overthrows the foundation of religion in the Churches whereof they are members.

all the Anabaptistick cavils are answered.
Had this good man lived in our days, he would have been censured by some for
Perkins the Persecutor; but wisdom is justified of her own children.

4. God is very tender over his Min^sters. None must Neque tactu oris, neque
tactu cordis.
touch his Prophets to hurt them; he takes the injuries done to them as done to
himself; as they are subject to greater tentations, so they are under more
special protection; he holds these Stars in his right hand, Rev. 2. 1.

So Magistrates should be very tender over the Messengers of Christ, who are
the best friends (if they be faithful) that Princes have in the world.
Magistracy and Ministry, the Word and the Sword should go together. The Pulpit
guards the throne; hence Nathan is called the friend of David, 1 Kings 4, 5.
King Ioram calls Elijah his Father, 2 Kings 6 21. and I^^osaph^t calls the
Levites his Sons, 2 Chronicles. 29. 11. and Hez^kiah spoke comfortable, delightful,
pleasing words to the hearts of the Levites, 2 Chronicles. 30. 22. The Magistrate
must protect their persons from Violence, and their maintenance from the
incroachment of cruel cormorants; least by famishing them he bring a famine of
the word upon the people. He must plant the word where it is wanting, and
continue it where it is planted. It Was well observed by Queen Elizabeth when the
Justices of Peace in the County of Suffolk met her Majesty in progress, O^
beatum popu^um in quo uno ore and uno animo utraque administratio ad Sa^ctam
communionem cum civili societate continendam and augendam conspiraverit! Non
min^^it illam haec administratio, sed altera alteram stantem confirmat,
labantem statuminat, collapsam ^rigit. Junius Eccles. l. 3. ^ 5.
every one of them having a Minister by him; I see the Reason (now says the
Queen) why the County of S^ffolk is better governed then other Counties; it is
because the word and the sword go together. Then Church and State are like to
flourish, when Moses and Aaron, Zerubbabel and Ios^ua, Zach. 4. 14. go hand in
hand together. When the Minister reproves sin, and the Magistrate punishes it;
When the Magistrate makes use of the Ministers direction, and the Minister
enjoyes the Magistrates protection; when Joshua joins with Eleazer, and David
consults with Nathan and Gad the Prophets of the Lord; and Josiah with Huldah,
and Vzziah with Zachariah the Priest, then and never till then can we look to
prosper, 2 Chronicles. 26 5. It Is Aarons office to speak, but it is Moses his Rod that
works the wonders. Ministers must Preach, and Magistrates must punish offenders.

7. As God searches and inquireth in^o men's causes before he punish; and
though he be the supreme and absolute Judge of all the world, yet we find that
he first cited Adam, and gave him a fair Trial before ever he turned him out
of Paradise, Genesis 3. 9. to 20. He never proceeds to judgment till the fact be
clear; though he had a cry come up to him concerning the blood of Abel, Li^^t
Deo omnia siat aperta, non tamen p^^^vit audita sed visa.
and the wickedness of Sodom, yet he searches and examines the matter to see
if it be according to the report, Gen 4. 9, 10, 11. and 18. 21. So the
Magistrate must be well advised what he does, and ponder all circumstances
before he pass sentence. So did Job (Chap. 29. 16.) The cause that I knew not,
I searched out. Oyer must go before Terminer. First Hear, and then Determine.
Nothing must be done rashly and unadvisedly, but upon serious and mature
deliberation must they proceed to judgment; else the Judges temerity will
prove the innocent persons calamity. As the Physician before he prescribes a
receipt or diet to his Patient, will first feel the pulse, veiw the Urine,
observe the temper and changes in the body, and inquire into the causes of the
disease, that so he may apply a fit remedy suitable to the malady: so ought
every Magistrate in causes of justice to hear both parties with equal patience,
fully and fairly; to examine witnesses thoroughly, Qui ^^tatuit aliquid part
i^audita altera, aequum licet statuerit, baud aequus erit. Seneca in Medea.
and to lay together all allegations, and give judgment accordingly. Reports
and probabilities are no sufficient ground; there must be a proof, and that by
men approved; else a I^z^bel may get false witnesses to accuse an innocent
Naboth.

Judges must not first hang a man and try him after; the Law condemns no man
till it have first heard what he can say for himself, John 7^ 5. Acts 25. 16.
It Is worth observing what a heap of words the Holy Ghost uses to make
Magistrates cautious in this kind. 1. They must search, 2. Inquire, 3.
di^^gently. 4. they must see that it be true and certain that such an
abomination is wrought. 5. ^hen and not till then must they proceed to
Judgment, Deuteronomy. 13. 14. and 17. 2, 4. and 19. 18. Judges 19. 30. many cases
are dark and difficult, and so cunningly contrived that it is the Kings honor to
search it out, Prove. 25. 2. as we see in Solomen in that difficult case of the
two Mothers, 1^ King^ 3. 16. 28. And if in lesser matters it be folly to answer
a matter before it be heard; how much more in such weighty cas^s? Prove. 18. 13.
Judges especially must take heed what they do. (2. Chr. 19. 6.) and therefore
it was a great oversight in D^vid to give away good Miph bosheths land before he
had heard him speak for himself, 2 Samuel 19. 29.

8. As God judges by Law, though he be Lord Paramount of all the world,
Iubetur Rex legum compendium propria manu describere, quo magis ea praecepta
i^haereant animo; ^am legentibus clabuntur sententiae, quod lectio moras non
patitur; qui autem scribit per ocium imprimit and infigit menti fingula
fideliter. Philo de creat. Princip. Non aliud potest Rex quam quod de jure
potest. See Lex Rex, p. 179. to 255. an excellent piece to this purpose, by Mr.
Rutherford.
and being absolute in himself might make his will his Law, and none may say
unto him What do thou? yet he judges according to the Law of nature. 2. By
the Moral Law, 3. By the Gospel. So Rulers must rule by Law, and not by Lust. (
Deuteronomy. 17. 11.) then their words have power with them, ( Eccles. 8. 4.) then
they are the higher powers indeed whom none may resist but at his own peril, (
Romans 13. 2.) whereas a Ruler and his will or lust is the Higher Weakness rather
then the Higher Power. The strength of Princes lies in the Law, as Sampsons
strength lay in his locks, and these are the peoples security. V. Plura apud
Gerhard. de Magistrate. p. 325, etc. Tom. 6.
Laws are the best walls of a City; Rex est Lex animal a. Philo
without them, even walled Cities want defense; they are as Physic to the
body, both for preventing and removing of diseases: yea they are as the soul to
the body; Iustum ^st Principem legibus obtemperare suis; tun^ enim jura ab
omnibus custodienda existinet, quando and ipse illis reverentiam praebet.
Isidor.
without them the Commonwealth would neither have beauty nor being. Where the
Magistrate obeyes the Laws, and the people obey the Magistrate, there is both
beauty, strength and safety. Such Magistrates as Practice their own Laws, may
the more boldly punish the Transgressors of them. Lycurgus nihil lege ull^
sanxit in a^os, cujus non ipse primus in se documenta daret. Justin. Hist. 1.
3.. 2.
David that went before his people in an holy Example, threatens judgment
against the workers of iniquity, Psalm. 101. It Was Lycurgus his honor that he
never made a ^aw which himself did not practice.

9. God does communicate his Goodness to all; he causes his Sun to shine upon
the just and unjust. So public persons should have public Spirits; their
gifts and goodness should diffuse themselves for the good of the whole. V. Mr.
Ant. Burges Ser. on Numb. 11, 12. p. 34. Preached 1645.
Their great care should be to promote the publich Interest more then their
own. So did Moses, Ex^d. 32. 10, 11, 32. Nehemiah, (Chap. 5. 6. to 19.) and
David (Psalm. 137. 5, 6. See Mr. Iacombs Seron Acts 13. 36.
Acts 13. 36) who served God and not himself in his generation. Ipse se non
hab^it, postquam mundus cum principem habere coepit.
It Was Caesar's high Commendation, that he never had himself, Non prees ut de
subditis cresas, sed ut ipse de te. Bern.
after the world had him for a Governor; his mind was so set on the public
that he forgot his own private affairs. The Stars have their brightness not for
themselves but for the use of others. Tyranaus suum spectat commodum, Rex vero
subd^orum. Arist. Polit. 1. 8. c. 10. and Philo li 2. Allegor. p. 108, 109.

Exodus 18. 22. he must not only be an Able, Wise, Religious, Just man, but he

Partiality, Symony, Perjury, Sacrilege and Pusillanimity. A Magistrate should
be a Magnanimous, Valiant man, but this sin dispirits a man, and makes him cold
and cowardly in the cause of God.

Now all those Governors Nihil est tam angusti animi, tamque parvi quam amare
divitias. Cicero lib. 1. Offic.
that are thus Qualified and do resemble God in the Particulars mentioned,
shall have Gods protection, the blessing of their people, the comfort of a good
conscience when they come to die (as Moses, Samuel, Hezekiah, Nehemiah;) and at
the day of Judgment (when the wicked shall cry to be hid) they shall appear
with comfort and confidence before Christ's Tribunal.

Quest. Will not this discourage inferior people when they hear great ones
called Gods, and see them exalted; when they are made to serve in inferior
callings?

Answ. Not at all; for there is much of God may be seen even in their callings.
The Husbandmans calling is looked upon as a mean employment, yet the Lord tells
us that it is he who teaches him to Plow, Sow, and Harrow, (Isa. 28. 24, 25,
26.) As he teaches the Warrier to fight, Psalm. 18. 34. and the Ruler how to
sway the Scepter, and Bezaliel his curious works, Exodus 35. 22. so he gives
Wisdom to the Husbandman how to order his affairs with discretion. It Is reported
of Heracli^us that when his Scholars had found him in a Tradesmans shop,
whither they were ashamed to enter, he encouraged them saying, Quod neque tali
loco dii desunt immortales, That the Gods were as well present in such places
as in others; intimating that a divine power and wisdom might be discerned even
in those common Arts which are so much despised. Hence Tarentinu^ persuaded his
friends to go with him to a Forge, and he would show them Gods handy work there
(Introite, inquit, Nihil in natura rerum tam ^ninutum, tamque vile and
abjectum, quod non aliquid admirationis hominibus adferat. Aristot. de anima.
1. ^. c. 5.
sunt his etiam Dii) so may we say of other Artificers, Come in and see Gods
handy work here. There Is no calling so mean but some footsteps of a Deity may
be seen there; and though thou be not the Head (thou have the less to account
for) yet the hands, feet and toes are useful in their places: and if thou walk
humbly with thy God in them, thou may come to heaven before Princes who
oft-times are Gods in name, but Devils indeed. It Is the glory of a land when
Ministers preach, Magistrates protect, People obey, and each in their places
help to preserve humane Society.

Observation 8.
God is not only present, but President and chief Ruler amongst the Rulers of
the world; he is King of Kings and Lord of Lords, (1 Timothy 6. 15. Rev. 17. 14.)
his eye is with them on the throne (Job 36. 7.) he sits on the bench amongst
them and is in their Assemblies; hence their Seat is called The holy place,
(Eccles. 8. 10.) God is Lord-chief-Justice on the Bench with them. He does not
only look on them, but he stands in the midst of them, and erects his Throne in
their Thrones, he eyes their Affections, takes notice of their actions, attends
their charges, and passes a censure upon their censures. As he has a more
especial interest in them, so he has a more especial eye upon them. Sen^ca
would have men to do all Tanquam spectet Cato: but Judges should do all Tanquam
spectet Deus, remembering Gods Al-seeing eye is still upon them. Iehosaphat
could not ride Circuit with his Judges, but God does. He is with them not only
by way of assistance and protection, but also by way of Observation; he takes
notice of every sentence that passes and will bring it again to Judgment: for
one special end of that great day, is, Iudicare non judicata, and male
judicata. To punish those sinners which have escaped unpunisht here, and to
rectify the unrighteous judgments of the world. This made a wicked Judge on
his deathbed to weep, Nuper cram judex, jam judicis a^te Tribunal Subsistens
pav^o, judicor ipse modo.
and being asked why? To think (said he) that I who have Judged others am going
now to be judged my self. As Masters on earth must remember that they have a
Master in Heaven (Co^os. 4. 1.) so Judges on earth must remember that they also
have a Judge in Heaven to whom they must shortly give an account. Let Judges
then remember that excellent counsel of I^hosoph (...) to his Judges, See this

Ser. on the same Text, Preached 1644. and also Mr. Case. Preached 1644.
2. Ch^^. 19. 6, 7 Take heed what ye do, for ye judge not for men but for the
Lord wh^ is with you in the judgem^ent.

1. Here is a duty enjoined, and that is See ten Reasons for this, in Mr.
Levi^y his Ser. on this Text. p. 93.
Circum. spection and accurate walking, take heed what you do, which is again
repeated; here is caution upon caution, (ver. 7.) to make the deeper impression
in them. Officium geritis magni momenti; multum potestis prodesse and ^besse;
considerate igitur diligenter, etc. Lavater in locum.
q. d. the execution of Justice is curious work, you had need therefore of open
eyes, steady hands and upright hearts.

2. Here is the Means to attain this, let the fear of God be upon you, ver. 7.
He that fears not God, will little regard the distresses of men, (Luke 18. 4.)
and will make but a sorry defender of such as do fear him; whereas he that
truly fears God, dares not wrong man, (Genesis 42. 18. Nebem. 5. 15.) Piety
advances Magistracy, it is the V. Beauty of Holiness, p. 152.
Honor of their Honors; as we see in V. Aug. de. Civit. Dei l. 5. cap. 25.
Constantine the Great; and therefore it is made a chief Qualification of a
Magistrate, that he be one that fears God, V. Frosts Ser. on Magistr. p. 288.
folio. Decorum est ut qui dignitate, probitate emineat. Decet id quod optimum
est, ab optimo coli, Stobaeus.

10, 11, 12. The lives of Rulers are the Lookingglass by which Inferiors dress
themselves, Qualis Rex, talis grex.
and the Rule by which they walk; Vbi Praeses Philosophus (Pius) ibi felix
civitas. Aristor. V. Plura apud Langium in Polyanth, de Magist^at. Q. 12. p.
1670. edit. ult.
they had need therefore to see how they walk; for, such Magistrates, usually
such people. This fear of the Lord is the foundation of all other Graces; and
where this is wanting, all is wanting; all virtues without this are but empty
shells, shows, shadows.

2. They must not respect persons in judgment, (Prove. 18. 5.) be they old or
young, Rich or Poor, Citizens or Strangers, Christians or Heathens, friends or
foes, he must not look at the Greatness of their persons, but the Goodness of
their cause. As God respects not any outward thing in man to move him to do so
and so; so Rulers must resemble him. Partiality staineth Justice, and cuts in
pieces the very Nerves of a State.

3. Take no Gifts. See my Comment. on 2 Timothy 3. 2. p. 27.
Bribes blind the eyes of the wise, and make them to pervert judgment. Judges
anciently were pictured without hands, Judges are called Gods, and God is known
by giving, not by receiving.
and without eyes. 1. Without hands, to note that Judges must not take gifts.
2. Without eyes, because they were to administer justice according to every
man's cause, without respect to any man's Relation, whether friend or foe; as
Christ, so those that rule under him must not judge by outward appearance, but
they must judge righteous judgment, Isa. 11. 3. There are four great
perverters of judgment, viz. fear, favor, hatred, Bribery; Quatuor ista,
timor, odium, dilectio, census, Saepe sol^nt hominum rectos pervertere sensus.
this last is not the least of the four, and therefore is so frequently
condemned in Scripture, Exodus 23. 8. Deuteronomy. 16. 17. and 16. 19. and 27. 26. Job
15. 34. Prove. 15. 27. and 17. 23. and 28. 21. and 29. 4. Psalm 26. 10. Isa. 5.
23. Amos 5. 12. Micah 3. 10. Acts 24. 26. They must imitate Moses and Samuel
who cleared themselves from this sin, ( Numb. 16. 15. 1. Sam. 12. 3.) For he
that takes a gift sells himself; and is bound to do somewhat for the bribe
he has received. It Is therefore made one note of a Citizen of Heaven that he
despises bribes, and takes no rewards to condemn the innocent, Psalm. 15. 5.
Isa. 33. 15. There is no difference in Gods Dictionary between Bribery and
Theevery, Isa. 1. 23. There is little difference between Give ye, and Deliver
ye; unless it be this, that the one goes in chain of Gold, when others lie in
Fetters of Iron. If any would see the Question stated how and when a man may
take a gift, let him peruse Rivet on Hosea 4. 19. p. 617. folio. Brochmand. C.
Consc. 2. Vol. p. 5061.

4. Since we are backward to the best things, Iehusaphat uses Motives to
encourage and excite Judges to a careful and conscientious discharge of their
duty. 1. They Judge not for man, i. e. not simply in the name and authority of
men, but for the Lord, who is the Supreme Ruler, to whom they must account: and
therefore it greatly concerns them to take heed what they do. Kings causes call
for great care and consideration: be that will manage them well, must take ^eed
what he does.

2. They must consider that God is with them, which serves first for Caution;
if they do ill, he is with them to punish them: for though they be mighty, yet
God is Almighty, and there is a greater then they, (Job 33. 12.) who stands in
their Assemblies, not as a bare Spectator, but as a Witness, Judge and Avenger
of such as act unrighteously, Job 12. 18, 19, 21. 2. It serves for comfort; he
is with them to defend them if they do well. The Devil throws his darts
principally at them: they destroy his Kingdom; and therefore he uses all means
to destroy them; he says to his Agents as Aram the King of Syria said to his
followers (1 Kings 22. 32.) Fight neither with small nor great, but against the
King of Israel; for when the Commander is conquered, the Soldiers fly.

3. There is no iniquity in the Lord; there is no injustice in him, and
therefore let there be none in you. But of this see more Verse 2, 3. of this
Psalm.

How great then is the sin of those who are not afraid in the very eye of the
Al-seeing God to favor wickedness and act unrighteously. It Is true they will
formally and in words confess that they reign Dei gratia, and providentia Dei;
yet they are so blinded with their Pomp, and infatuated with their Greatness,
that God is not in all their thoughts, nor must He, his Laws, or People have
any room amongst them. These the Psalmist ^acitely reproves, See four good
Lessons from Gods-al-seeing eye in my Commentary on 2 Timothy 4. 1. Obs. 3. p. 306.
by telling them that God stands in their Assemblies, and takes notice of all
their ways.

Observation 9.
The judgment of Judges is the Lords judgment, Deuteronomy. 1. 17. 2 Chronicles. 19. 6.
they have their power from him, Iudicium est ipsius Dei Originaliter,
authoritative and principaliter; at Magistratus Minis^^rialiter and instrument
al^er.
John 19. 11. and therefore such as stand before Judges, are said to stand
before the Lord, because the judgment is his, Deuteronomy. 19, 17. yea though they be
wicked men, yet he judges amongst them; Iudicium Dei est; proinde Iudex in
tribus D^o debet conforma^i, in Po^estate, Bonitate and Veritate.
though not always by consenting and approving of what they do (for they often
err and do unjustly) yet always by observing and overruling their Counsels to
his own praise; and though they have Self Ends and Plots, yet God has a Plot
above their Plots, which they effect when they mind nothing less, as we see in
Pilate, Judas, Satan in putting Christ to death, Acts 2. 23. and 4. 28.

Be patient therefore and silent under the unrighteous censures and judgments
of men: for God can and will turn them to his peoples good, as we see in
Joseph's selling and imprisonment, in the three young men that were cast into
the fiery Furnace, and Daniel into the Lions D^n, yet all advanced to honor by
their sufferings.

Observation 10.
Going to Law (when just occasion requires) is lawful: To what end has God
ordained Judges (Deuteronomy. 16. 18.) and commanded men to bring their causes and
controversies before them (Deuteronomy. 19. 17. and 25. 1.) it they might not hear
them? Would God (think we) stand in their Assemblies and judge amongst them, if
such judgments were unlawful? or would Christ have approved (or not rather
reproved men) for going before the Magistrate? Luke 12. 58. and 18. 3.

It Is true indeed, 1. A man should not go to Law for every trifle: for every
vain, hasty word, or petty trespass to disquiet a man's self, and molest his
neighbor, argues a turbulent unmortified spirit. It Is the glory of a man to
pass by such petty offenses. Men should not for a six penny damage spend six
pound; It Is a shame that our Law is not rectified in this particular.

2. He must not go to Law in malice, or with a revengeful mind to destroy his
neighbor, but he must do all in a spirit of love and meekness, Sic certent
causae, ut non cer^^nt pect^ra.
defending himself from wrong by Law, and seeking Peace, Truth and
Righteousness.

3. A man must make Law (as men do war) their last Refuge. He must use all wife
means to prevent it, by offering Peace and Reconciliation, referring it,
Sapi^^^lem omnia prius experiri, quam armis d^cet. Terent.
and putting it off as long as may be: and when nothing will do, we may safely
fly to the Law.

The Anabaptists hold it unlawful (what ever the injury or abuse be) to go to
Law, or seek to the Magistrate for aid. But their folly will easily appear, if
we consider, 1. That God has ordained Magistracy for this very end, to succor
us in our distress. 2. We have Examples of those who have pleaded their cause,
and that before Heathen Judges) as Christ before Pilate, John 18. 23. and Paul
(when he was in danger) did plead the Law, and appeal to Caesar, Acts 23. 3.
and 25. 10, 12.

Objection.
Mat. 5. 39. 40. Christ forbids us any resisting of evil etc.

Answ.
Christ speaks there against private and inordinate revenge, See this Text more
fully vindicated from all Socinian Cavils, by Gerhard de Magistrate. p. 360.
proceeding from Wrath and Passion; and not against lawful, ordinate public
defense before a Magistrate.

2. The words are not Positive, but comparative. q. d. rather then thou
should be provokt to reward evil for evil, suffer a double injury; and if by
thy bearing and forbearing Peace may be preserved, the Gospel honored thy
profession adorned, and thy Brother bettered, then thou must suffer two
injuries rather then revenge one.

Objection 2.
1 Corin. 6. 1. to 8. Here (say the Anabaptists) the Apostle speaks against
men's going to Law.

Answ.
There is no such thing in the Text, as will easily appear to such as read it
at large.

1. The Apostle does not simply condemn men's going to Law, Est fallacia a dicto
secundum quid ad dictum simpliciter^am simpliciter non reprehendit judicia, sed
temeritatem in litigando, quod nihil privatim transigere voluerunt, sed in
resaepe levicula alter alterum ad tribunal Ethnici judicis pro trahebat, non
sine injuria and contemptu Christianitatis. Baldwin in locum.
but he condemns their bitterness and cruelty in Lawing, not bearing one with
another, but vexing one another for trifles, when Christians should be patient,
ready to forgive injuries, according to that of our Savior, Forgive, and it
shall be forgiven you, Luke 6. 37.

2. He blames them, for that they being Christians yet went to Law before
Heathenish Judges, to the reproach of Christianity; for they being Christians
should have had Christians to have heard and ended their controversies. So that
he does not condemn their going to Law, but tells them how they should do it.

See what Anabaptistick Logic here is, because Christ forbids Lawing before
Heathens therefore we may not go to Law before Christians. The Argument is
Cogent thus; The Apostle condemns Christians for going to Law before Heathen
Judges, therefore he allows of it before Christian Judges.

3. If the Apostle should absolutely condemn all suing to the Magistrate in
case of wrong, then he should contradict his own Practice; for he being in
distress, did more then once Appeal to Caesar.

See this Case fully cleared by Mr. John Downam on the Sacrament, chap. 12.

Christian equity. p. 446, 447. Vol. 2. and Zepper de Legibus Mosaic. l. 5. c.
6. p. 693.

VERSE 2.
How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons ^f the wicked? Selah.
THese words are a Prosopope^cal speech, where the Lord is brought in
Reasoning, Reproving and Expostulating the case with the unrighteous Judges of
those times. Such is the Pride of great ones, Ut majorem efficaciam habeat
objurgatio, inducitur Deus summ^s Iudex in^repans judices mino^es. Bellarm.
that they cannot bear a reproof from men: and therefore the Prophet to procure
the more Authority to what should be spoken, brings in God himself reproving
them: hence some Interpreters conceive that for explanation sake the word
[saying] may fitly be added to the end of this first Verse: God stands in the
Congregation of the mighty, he judges amongst the Gods, Saying, How long will
ye judge unjustly? q. d. Since I am present and President amongst you, how long
will ye favor the wicked, and plead their cause against the innocent?

In this Verse we have 1. The sin reproved in general, and that is Unjust
judgment; a sin most proper and peculiar to Judges. To be covetous, envious,
passionate and proud, is evil; but to judge Unjustly, to justify the wicked,
and condemn the just, is not only abominable, but an abomination in the How

it implies that they had for a long time persevered in this Practice; Usque qu^

3. Here is the Generality of the sinners employed in the word, Ye; how long
w^lye, i. e. all of ye judge unjustly? There might be some few, some gleanings,

very corrupt.

4. Here is an Exegesis, an Illustration, or (if you will) an Aggravation of
what went before. Ye judge unjustly; See this phrase more fully explained in

ye plead their causes; but the cause of the Poor and the Righteous man cannot
be heard. In the Original it is, ye accept the face of the wicked. Now to accept
the face of a man, is an Hebrew phrase, Non dicit impios suscipitis, sed facies
impiorum suscipitis; at intelligas eum non de quibusvis impiis, sed de iis
loqui qui spectabiles sunt vel propter generis praerogativam, vel proper opum
splendorem, Musculus.
and signifies a showing favor and respect to a man. Genesis 19. 22. The Angel
tells Lot, that he had respected his face. q. d. I have showed favor to thee,
and have given thee thy request. The words seem to be an Aggravation of their
sin; they did not sin through weakness, but through wilfulness; not through
simple ignorance, but presumptuously; they sought the faces and favor, not of
poor men, or of friends; that might favor of some humanity (though it may not
be practiced in judgment) yea they sought the faces not simply of sinners, but
of wicked, potent, Reshagnaim, Improbi, inquieti, turbulenti.
tur bulent, notorious sinners. To get the favor of these who could bribe
them, or some way gratify them, they perverted judgment, and instead of
punishing the wicked they acquitted them; and instead of defending the poor,
they contemned them, and trampled on them.

Selah.
Where we find this word (sometimes) there is in that Verse some remarkable
thing; as in this Verse it signifies as much in English, Selah hic adscriptum
monet malum hoc quo nihil magis execrandum, passim and apud eos quoque qui
admodum justi videntur, plane regnare. Ut Scultetus e Bucero.
as if David had said, O how great and grievous an offense is it before God,
for favor and affection, for gifts and greatness, to pervert Justice and
Judgment! It comes from Salal, which signifies to raise or elevate; and so it
may signify the elevation of the mind in marking, or of the voice in singing.
It sometimes signifies an Asseveration of a thing so to be, Cantor ubi ad ^anc
vocem pervenerat, a^toll b^t vocem suam; and hoc signum erat gravem ibi
sententiam contineri, in quam a^im^s intendendus erat; redditur a doctis per
plane, sum, vehementer. Ravanellus. See more in such as Comment on Psalm. 3.
2. and Rivet. in Psalm. 24. 6. p. 170. folio
and an admiration at it. It is used seventy four times in Scripture.

Observation 1.
Even great men when they go astray, must be sharply reproved. God does not
here barely say, Do not unjustly, do not respect persons, etc. but as one that
is angry with them, he sharply and severely expostulates the case with them,
saying, How long will ye judge unjustly, and respect the persons of the mighty?
And as God, so his Ambassadors according to their places must not fear the face
of man: but as occasion requires, they must tell the greatest of their sins:
yet with a See Mr. Reyners Government of the Tongue. p. 178.
Prudential consideration of all Circumstances; for if we must respect Elders
for their age ( 1 Timothy 5. 1.) then much more Rulers who are set in public
place of dignity: and therefore as in the reprooving of all men, so especially
of great men, great Wisdom and Prudence is required; as we see in Nathan who
wisely catches David in a Parable, (2 Samuel 12. 1, etc.) and that Prophet which
caught Ahab in his own words, and made him pass sentence upon himself, 1 Kings
20. 39, 40. It Is not for every one to say unto Kings, Ye are wicked, Job 34. 18.
It Is Ministers and such as are called to the work, that may with Elijah tell
Ahab of his wickedness It Is a Samuel that must reprove a Saul, (1 Samuel 15. 19.)
Isaiah reproves H^z^kiah, (Isa. 39. 6.) Jeremy King Zedekiah (Ier. 32. 4.) and
John Bap^ist Herod: If great men do amiss we must not stick to say to Kings and
Queens, Humble your selves, Ier. 13. 19. We are set to watch not only for poor
men's souls, but also for the souls of Rulers; yea rather for them then for
others, because by their Example they do much hurt or good. Many think it no
sin to do, what they see great one do. As like Priest, like people, (Ier. 50.
6. Hos. 4. 9.) so usually like Mastrate, like people; if they be good, the
people will be the better, Judges 2. 7. Josh. 24. 24. David's bounty in building
the Temple encouraged the people to follow him, 1 Chronicles. 29. 6, 7. If the King
of Niniveh humble himself, Great men should be good men. V Buroughs Gracious
Spirit. p. 204.
so will the people, Jonah 3. 6. Rulers are like Looking-glasses, by which most
men dress themselves; if they be bad, like great Cedars when they fall they
bring many branches down with them, and crush the shrubs that are under them.
If Jeroboam sin, he will quickly draw all Israel to sin with him, 1 Kings 14. 16.
If a Ruler hearken to lies, his servants will be like him, Mobile m^tatur
semper cum Principe Vulgus. Claudian.
Prove. 29. 12. This made the Pharisees to reject Christ because none of the
Rulers believed in him, John 7. 48. which made Luther to say, Principum delicta
sunt plane Diabolica. Great men's sins are the greatest sins, because they sin
against great means of grace, and by their example do much mischief. When the
Head is unsou^d, A capite primum co^putrescunt Pisces. Prove.
the body must needs miscarry: no error so dangerous as that which proceeds
from the Ruler, Eccles. 10. 5. Jerusalem was full of abominations; what is the
cause? why the Prophets were profane, and the Princes were as roaring Lions,
and the Judges Wolves, Zeph. 3. 3. Subjects study the lives of their Princes
more then their Laws; they should therefore be great Reformers (as Asa, Josiah,
and Hezekiah were, who drew the people with them,) 2 Chronicles. 15. and 31. 1, etc.
Greatness accompanied with goodness is like a Ring with a rich Diamond which
inhaunceth the price. Now the Prophets seeing that the public enormities of
Rulers have such an influence on people, have enveighed sharply against their
sins, (Isa. 1. 23. and 10. 1, 2, 3. Hosea 5. 1. Micah 3. 1, 2.) and the command
is general without any limitation to high or low (1 Timothy 5. 20.) such as sin
before all, rebuke before all that others may fear; Indeed if their sins be
Private and mere Infirmities, we must with the mantle of love cover them, least
we exasperate instead of healing them.

Objection.
Such plain Preachers are counted the Troublers of Israel, Ier. 37. 13. 15.
Amos 7. 12.

Answer.
It Is true, they have been so accounted, but it has been by wicked men who have
themselves been the Troublers of Israel, as Elijah told Ahab, 1 Kings 18. 18.

2. If great men would but hearken to the pious counsel of Gods faithful
Messengers, it would prevent Seditiors, Tumults and Troublers in their
Territories.

Observation 2.
That continuance in evil is a great evil. How long (says God) will ye judge
unjustly? and when will you make an end of your unrighteous practices? To do an
unjust act is ill, but to persevere for many years in acting Unrighteousness is
the height of evil. As perseverance in goodness is the Crown of goodness, Job
2. 3. so perseverance in sin is sin in grain, Humanum est errare, at Diabolicum
perseverare in errore. Gerson.
it is of a deep dye, it is hardly if ever set out again.

Observation 3.
It Is no wonder to see Judges judge Unjustly. They did so here, and God
complains of such elsewhere, Isa. 1. 23. Ier. 5. 1. Mic. 3. 9. there are some
such now, and there will be such to the end of the world, even till he who is
Judge of Judges shall come to Judgment, and shall abolish all Rule and
Dominion. Wicked men in all ages have the same corrupt Natures and Principles
within them, and when Temptations come they discover themselves. Besides, the
world ever did and ever will love her own; wicked Magistrates will favor
wicked men; yea if there were no Bribery nor flattery in the world, yet wicked
great ones would favor such as are like themselves.

Observation 4.
Few great men are good men. Some there are but they are thin sown. Not many
wise men, not many mighty, not many Noble; i. e. some few are cal^ed; See Mr.
Rob. Bolton on that Text, and Mr. Fran. Tayl^r.
1 Cor. 1. 26. They are subject to great Temptations, and so to great
Corruptions. Such rank ground is fertile in weeds; hence wicked men are put in
the Text for Rich men. How long will ye accept the persons of the wicked? That
is, the persons of rich and potent men; that is the meaning; for Judges would
never accept the persons of the wicked men if they were Poor and equal in
respect of outward things. This the opposition implies, Defend the poor and
fatherless, implying that the rich were defended by them, but the Poor had no
Helper.

Observation 5.
That perverting of judgment is a great sin. It Is a crying sin, it cries for
Vengeance on such as practice it. This was one of those sins which caused the
day of Ierusalems misery to draw nearer, Ezekiel. 22. 6, 7. and for which the Lord
threatens to visit, Isa. 5. 6, 7. Ier. 5. 28, 29. Amos 2. 6. and 5, 6, 7, 11.
M^l. 3. 5. If he be cursed that shall remove the Landmark, what shall be done
to him who takes away house, land and all? Deuteronomy 27. 17. Solomon tell us, he
that justifies the wicked, him shall the people curse, Prove. 24. 24. for
Judges to turn aside in Judgment to the right hand or the left, is to abuse
their Deputatior, and as much as in them lies to UnGod themselves and God too.
An Unjust Judge (as one well observes) is a cold fire, a dark Sun, Quaenam
potest perniciosior esse perversi^as quam si apud medicum invenias mortem, apud
doctorem mendacium, apud Iudicem injustitiam? Musculus.
a dry Sea, a mare mortuum, an Vn-good God, contradictio in adjecto, Monsters
not men, much less Gods A false Teacher that poisons souls, and a corrupt Judge
that pervers justice, are two pestilent evils: the one destroys the fountain of
Piety, and the other the fountain of Righteousness. If a man be oppr^st, V.
Comforts against Oppression. Mr. Ash his Ser. on Psalm. 9. 9. preached 1642. and
Mr. Caryll S^r. on Psalm. 119. 134. preached 1651.
he flies to the Law for refuge; but if the Law be wrested and abused where
shall we find a remedy? It Is sad with the flock when the Shepherd is a Wolf.
Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?

Observation 6.
Magistrates must Judge impartially. They must not respect persons but causes.
They must look more on the face of the cause, then the face of the man. This
respecting of persons is not good, Meiosis. V. Schools-Guard, on that figure.
(says Solomon) that is, it is very bad, Prove. 24. 23. It Is a fin often forbidden,
Deuteronomy. 1. 17. and 16. 19. Job 13. 8. 10. 2 Chronicles 19. 6, 7. Prove. 18. 5. and 28.
21. James 2. 9. Jude 16. Men must not judge according to any outward appearance
or quality of the person that appears before them, but according to the equity
of the cause, (John 7, 24.) As God respects not persons (Deuteronomy. 10. 17. Job 34.
19. Acts 10. 34. Gal. 2. 6. Ephesians. 6. 9. Colos. 3. ult. 1 Pet. 1. 17.) So
Judges who are earthly Gods must imitate their Lord and Master whose person
they represent, in whose seat they sit, and by whose command they act. So that
if they will do any thing in favor of the mighty, let them do it in favor of
the mighty God; and this they do, when they execute Justice and Judgment in
the gate. As they must not respect the rich for his riches, so neither the poor
for his poverty, Pressa est pauperlas, opulentia spl^ndida regnat; Dives ubique
valet, pauper ubique jacet.
so as in pity to him to wrong the rich, nor out of fear or honor to the rich
comply with them to oppress the poor, Exodus 23. 3. Lev. 19. 15. In charity we
must have respect to a poor man's necessity; but in point of Justice neither the
power of the rich, nor the Penury of the poor, but Right only must be regarded
(Psalm. 72. 7.) if a man might strain the Law for any, it is for the poor; and yet
the Lord himself who is most tender over the poor, will not have their persons
but their causes looked upon. A respector of person is a kind of Idolater,
Prosopolatria est Idololatria.
the respect which he owes to God and Right, he gives to Riches. Petty Thieves
shall wear chains of Iron, when grand Robbers and Murderers sit on the Bench
with chains of Gold. As God knows no Honor, Royalty or Greatness in the matter
of sin, so neither must his Deputies. I see no Reason (said the woman) why I
should be punished for breaking one commandment, when King Richard breaks all
Ten and yet goes Unpunisht. The Judges in Egypt were painted without hands and
blind; and the Areopagites who were Judges in Athens passed their sentence in
the night, and had their Judicatories in dark rooms that they might not be
biased by prejudice or affection to pass wrong Judgment upon the person. Out
of Judgment to show favor to our friends is not Unlawful; but in point of
Judgment they must be blind not knowing friend or foe, but look soberly on the
cause which is before them. When public right is in Question, the Poor person
m^s^ be said aside, and we must eye his cause; for th^u^h it be seldom seen
that a poor man is preferred before a Rich man in his cause, yet sometimes it
may so fall out that at the tears and cries of the Poor, and to get a Name for
a merciful man amongst men, there may be offending on that hand. It Is true, we
must show mercy, but yet with Judgment and discretion. In other cases we may
show respect to men for their age, gifts, graces, affinity, dignity, calling,
etc. but not in Judgment. The Court must know no Kinsmen. Judges must with
David do justice to All the people without distinction of rich or poor (2 Samuel
8. 15.) they must dispense Justice with an equal hand and an even balance. As
the Law it self is equal to all, so should the Judge who is a living Law, be
the same to all that fly unto him for succor. So that this makes nothing for
the Sottish, Uncivil Quakers who cry down all outward respect and reverence to
men in authority under pretense of respect to no man person: Whereas the
Scripture does not condemn civil but sinful respect of persons, See more on
this Point in my Comment. on 2 Timothy 4. 19. p. 468.
The Servant must reverence his Master, and the Child his Father, and the
Subject his Sovereign. Besides there is a sacred respect of persons used both
by God and man. Thus God had respect to Abel and his offernig, but not to Cain.
He had respect to Lot and saved him out of Sodom, Genesis 19. 21. Thus the Saints
may and must love the Saints with a spiritual and more intimate love, Psalm. 16.
3.

Observation 7.
Wicked men are Turbulent men. They are the great Reshagnims of the world. They
disquiet and trouble themselves; like the troubled Sea they are always casting
up the dirt and filth of sin, ( Prove. 11. 17. Isa. 57. 20, 21.) They trouble
their own houses, Prove. 15. 27. yea these Achans and Ahabs trouble all Israel;
they are the Pests and Plagues, the Ulcers and Botches of the places where they
live. As good men are a public good, and make the places where they live the
better for them. (Genesis 12. 2.) so wicked men are public evils and make the
places where they dwell the worse for them. As grace meekens men and makes them
quiet, ( Isa. 11. 6.) so sin where it raigns and is not subdued, disquiets men
and makes them turbulent.

V^RSE 3.
Defend the Poor and Fatherless, do Justice to the afflicted and needy.
V^RSE 4.
Deliver the Poor and needy, rid them out of the hand of the wicked.
HAving finished the Reprehension, and showed Negatively what Judges must not
do, viz. they must not Judge unjustly, nor respect persons: Now we come to the
Direction, where the Lord teaches them and tells them Affirmatively what they
must do. viz. they must defend the poor and fatherless, and succor such as are
in distress: So that having dehorted them from the Vices which are more
especially incident to Rulers, he now exhorts them to the contrary Virtues. So
that here we have a clear description of the Magistrates duty which consists
princicipally of two parts. 1. To defend the good. 2. To punish the bad; both
which are also mentioned by the Apostle, Rom 13. 3.

This counsel of God (says Luther) is worthy to be written in Letters of gold
on the walls of all Judicatories. It may fitly be termed Gods Charge to
Magistrates. They give charges to men, and here God gives four things in charge
to them.

viz.
1. To defend. 2. To do Justice. 3. To Deliver. 4. To Rescue.
2. The Object or the Persons whom they must thus Protect
1. The Poor. 2. The Fatherless. 3. The afflicted. 4. The needy.
As if the Lord had said, This is your main business, and therefore let it be
your great care, to defend the poor, succor the afflicted, and support the
fatherless, and to help him who has no Helper. As the proper work of the
Physician is to cure the sick, and of a Minister to comfort the weak, so of a
Magistrate to defend the Poor, and vindicate the Oppressed from the violence of
the Oppressor.

Question.
Must not the Magistrate defend the rich man in a righteous cause as well as
the Poor? must he not execute Justice for him as well as for the needy? Why
then does the Lord here only mention the poor?

Answer.
It Is true, Magistrates must execute Justice for rich men as well as for the
poor: yet since the poor are most subject to injury, therefore the Magistrate
must be more careful to defend them. The poor are low in condition, and are
often laid lower by Oppression: now God has raised up Magistrates for this
very end, to protect them in their low condition, and to lift them up when they
are laid lower by oppression.

2. As for Rich men, the world loves her own, especially her White Sons, her
Great and Prosperous Children, so that their causes are sure to be heard, and
their right improved to the utmost who have so many Auro loquente quis tace^it?
Angels to appear for them. Rich men have many friends, Prove. 14. 20. Where
money is stirring, let the cause be never so unjust, yet oft-times might
overcomes right, so great an influence has riches upon the Rulers of this
world. So that it is needless to bid Rulers plead for Rich and Mighty men.
Besides, men are afraid of wronging great ones, because they have great power
and many friends to Vindicate them against the wrongs of any.

3. There Is an aversness and backwardness in our Natures to help the Poor, who
have no gifts nor friends to side with them, who have nothing to plead but only
the justness of their cause. Men that are in Poverty and Adversity find few
friends; Hence it is that the poor is often hated even of his own neighbors,
(Prove. 14. 20. and 197.) but the lovers of the rich are many. The poor Procigal
is called This thy Son, not this my Brother, Luke 15. 30.

4. Where the hedge is low, men are apt to get over. When men are poor, then
great menespecially are apt to trample on them, Dente timentur ^pri, defendunt
cornua cervos; Imbelles damae, quid nis^ praeda sumus? Martial Epigr. l. 13.
ep. 95.
1 Samuel 18. 23. hence it is that God lays such special Injunctions on the
Magistrate to see to them. The Birds of prey can shift for themselves, selves,
but it is the poor Dove that is made a prey. Hence the Fatherless, the Widow, the
Poor, the Stranger and the Oppressed are ^oked together in Scripture, because
in respect of their weakness they they are more liable to wrong, (Deuteronomy. 14. 29.
Psalm. 10. 18. Mal ^3* 5. James 1. 27.) It Is not the Ass of the rich, or the Ox
of the mighty, but it is the Ass of the Fatherless, and the Ox of the widow that
is taken away, Job 6. 27. and 24. 3.

5. The Lord speaks here to unrighteous Judges, who sided with the rich and
turbulent oppressors of the poor; and to make his Exhortation take the deeper
impression, he multiplies words, and does as twere bid them Defend, Defend,
Defend. Whom? The Poor, the Poor, the Poor. As the Lord said of Jerusalem, I
will overturn, overturn, overturn it; i. e. I will speedily and certainly
overturn it, Ezekiel 21. 27. So the V. Schools-Guard, Rule 43.
doubling and trebling of the duty and persons here is very Emphatical, and
notes Gods earnest affection and desire to have the poor and fatherless
speedily and certainly defended against the oppressions of the mighty.

Defend the poor, i. e. defend the cause of the poor, since he cannot defend
himself. Or, Judge for the poor and fatherless (as it is in the fountain) i. e.
in your judgment vindicate them and their just causes from the Sons of
violence. Shiptu dal. judicate pro tenui. Mont.
They are Gods Clyents, and therefore they should be the Judges care: for this
end God has set them in his stead, that they might defend those who cannot
defend themselves, and use their Power for the good of those who have no power,
Job 26. 2. The Hebrew word Dal which we render Poor, The word Poor, is a
comprehensive word, including in it all sorts of Poor*
comes from Dalal to spend or consume; and is applied to the weak and sickly,
whose health is spent (Genesis 41. 19. 2 Samuel 13. 4.) and to the poor whose wealth
is wasted, (Psalm. 41. 1. and 72. 12, 13. ^ and 113. 7.) and they fallen into
decay, Lev. 25. 35. The word is opposed to rich men, who in Scripture are
called great men, full and fa^, Psalm. 78. 31. and only men of wealth, Ruth 2.
1. Ier. 49. 32. Now it is not these full and fat ones who have many friends, but
it is the lean and weak man, that is poor in purse, sickly in person, and many
other ways brought low; it is these poor hopeless, helpless ones that Rulers
must have a care of. It Is not only their duty but their Glory so to do, Job 29.
11. to 18.

And Fatherless.] or the Orphan, that has no father or friend to help him,
Ia^om, Pupillus Orphan^^^. Lam. 5* 3.
but is forsaken of all. The word signifies one that has lost his sight,
because he that has lost his parents is deprived of the light of counsel and
direction how to carry himself in the world; (...) ab (...) tenebrosus, quod
liberi quodammodo amittunt lucem and pupilla^ oculo^um, amiss^s parentibus.
Minshew.
as God delights to help those who cannot help themselves, (Prove 23. 10, 11.)
So must earthly Gods. The word is rendered by the Septuagint, Poor; indeed the
poor and fatherless are often joined in Scripture, and are Synonyma's, being put
for one and the same person.; as Psalm. 10. 14. The poor commits himself to
thee; thou art a Father to the fatherless. He that is called Poor in the
beginning of the Verse, is called fatherless in the end. The word is taken
sometimes properly, for one that has lost his Father. 2. Metaphorically, for
such as are in deep distress and have no helper. Now we are not to restrain the
sense here only to Orphans; for he that is a Father, may be called fatherless;
and the child that has a Father, yet may be called fatherless; when he
extremely needs the help either of God, or man, Hos. 14. 3.

Do justice to the afflicted and the needy.] or as the Original runs, Justify
the afflicted. q. d. if his cause be just, fear not to Justify him, and
pronounce him Judicially just and innocent. Many unjust Judges will hear the
causes of the poor; but when they have heard them and found them to be right,
Hitsd^ku, justificate, absolvite, and justum pronunciate,
yet they do not justify them, but the wicked. The Afflicted and the poor are
joined in Scripture, (Zeph. 3. 12.) because poverty is usually accompanied with
many afflictions. The word Gnani which we render afflicted, Humile^^ and (...)
ju^^ificate. Vulg Lat.
signifies also to be Humble and Meek (Zach. 9. 9) for as Riches make men cruel
and proud; so affliction makes men humble and lowly.

And needy.] Properly the word signifies a poor man that has lo^t his goods,
Rash paupe, from Rush, depau^erdri, to be impo^risht or made poor.
and so is brought to poverty and misery, whether by oppression or otherwise.
These are called the Poor of this world James 2. 5. and the poor of the earth,
Job 24. 4. Amos 8. 4.

Verse 4.
Deliver the poor and needy, from the violence of the mighty; the same is again
repeated to make the deeper impression, Eb^on, (...), a poor, indigent, needy
creat^re, from Abab (...), because the poor that have nothing, desire food,
raiment, money and such things as they want.
and to show how earnest God is to have Judges put it in execution. God drives
this nail to the Head with one exhortation upon the neck of another, to fas^en
it the better in our hearts and memories.

Rid them out of the hand of the wicked. i. e. free and rescue him from the
paws and power of turbulent men, who like their father the Devil, delight in
vexing others. The words seem to be a Gradation, and not a bare repetition. 1.
Judges must hear the cause of the poor. 1. (...), 2. Iustificate. 3. Eripite.
2. Having found them innocent, they must justify them and declare their
innocence. 3. They must not rest there, Eripere pauperem de (...) potentis est
senten^am adversus potentem pro paupere just pronuntiatam executi^^ ma^dare,
and reipsa efficere ut pauper (...) trimenti a potentiore inimico patiatur.
Bellarm.
but they must rescue and deliver them as Lambs out of the Paws and Jaws of the
Lion. By this variety of words and multiplication of expressions the Holy Ghost
denotes unto us all kind of misery which we are exposed to in this world by
reason of potent and politic enemies. What ever the misery be, whether in
body, goods, or name, (such is Gods goodness) that he would have Magistrates
who are his Vicegerents to take notice of it, and deliver his people out of it.

Observation 1.
Magistrates must be a Defense to the poor and fatherless, to the afflicted and
the needy. They are that great Tree which must shelter such as are under them
from storms Dan. 4* 20, 21, 22. They are called Gods, and in this they must act
like him whose name they bear. Now 1. Sometimes the poor lie in deep distress,
and then the Lord is a Refuge to them, Isa. 25. 4. He hears their cry, (Psalm.
34. 6. and 69. 33.) whether it be vocal or virtual; for sometimes the poor man's
afflicted condition cries though he say nothing, and God hears this cry, Psalm
12. 5. for the oppression of the poor will I arise: though the oppressed should
not Vocally cry, yet their very oppression Virtually cries for help, James 5. 4.

2. Sometimes they lie in the dust, and then he raises them (Psalm. 113. 7.)
they lie amongst the pots and are sullied with affliction, yet then he makes
them beautiful like a Dove, Psalm. 68. 13.

3. Sometimes they are environed with mighty enemies, and then he rescues them,
Job 5. 15, 16.) by cutting off their oppressors, and comforting the oppressed,
Job 36. 6, 15.

4. But specially the godly poor, God is very tender over these: he that
to^cheth them to hurt them, ^oucheth the apple of his eye. These are his
Jewels, his Glory, his Portion, his Pleasant Portion, his Inheritance, his
Dove, his Spouse, his anointed ones: and if Kings wrong them, he will rebuke
even Kings for their sakes, saying, Touch not mine anointed, Psalm. 105. 15.
Amos 2. 6. God visits for such sins.

5. As for the fatherless who are exposed to much sorrow (and therefore Christ
promises his Disciples that he will not leave them Orphans or fatherless, John
14. 18.) God has styled himself a Father to them, Psalm. 68. 5. Hos. 14. 3. 2.
He has made many Laws for them, Exodus 22. 22 De^t. 16. 11, 14. and 24. 17. and
26. 12, 13. and curses those that wrong them, Deuteronomy. 27. 19. 3. He charge
Magistrates in the Text to be tender over them So Isa. 1. 17. Job 29. 12. and
31. 17, 18, 21. 4. When Magistrates are negligent in defending them, he hears
their cry, and threatens to visit for that sin, Isa. 1. 23, 24. Ier. 5. 28, 29.
and 21. 12. Mal. 3. 5. 5 If Magistrates will not plead their cause, yet God
will, D^ut. 10. 18. Psalm. 10 ult. and 146. 9. Prove. 23. 11.

6. S. Iames^ sums up all religion (as twere) into this one duty. It Is not
enough that we Hear, Pray, and Worship God, but we must also love our
Neighbors, and show pity to the poor and fatherless, without which all our
profession is vain, James 1. 27. Now Magistrates in their capacity and calling
must resemble God, they must be a Refuge to the poor, a Father to the
fatherless, and a comfort to the comfortless. Job who was an eminent Magistrate
in his time, how tender was he over the poor and fatherless! Men's necessities
are many, but most of them spring from Ignorance and want of Skill, or
Impotency and want of power, both noted here by blindness and lameness. Job was
a guide to the blind, and a staff to the lame, leading the one, and supporting
the other. D. Sanderson 1. ser. ad Magistr. p. 162*
he was eyes to the blind, feet to the lame, a father to the poor; and the
blessing of him who was ready to perish came upon him, and he made the widows
heart to sing for joy. Job. 29. 12. etc. 30. 15. and 31. 17, 21. especially he
must defend the Godly Poor, who are often contemned by the high and haughty of
the world for their poverty, and hated for their piety. These commit themselves
and their cause to God ( Psalm. 10. 14.) and therefore they are called His poor,
by a ^pecial propriety, ( Psalm. 72. 2.) He, speaking of Solomon, shall judge
thy people with equity. Gods Deputies must be tender over those whom God so
tenders, that he prizeth them above all the world besides.

Do justice.
Observation 2.
As Magistrates m^st administer Justice unto all, so especially to the
afflicted and distressed. These are most liable to injury; and therefore if
Justice incline to any side with favor, it should be toward the poor. This is
the very end why Rulers are set up. viz. to execute judgment, and do Justice
amongst the people, Isa. 56. 1. Hos. 12. 6. Amos 5. 24. Zach. 7. 9. Therefore
it is that David prayed for his Son Solomon, that God would give him a clear
understanding and right judgment to discern between good and evil; and an
upright heart to walk answerable to light received, that so he might Judge the
people with righteousness, and the poor with judgment, Psalm. 72. 1, 2. and
Solomon himself makes the like prayer, 1 Kings 3. 9. and the Queen of sheba
tells him that God had raised him for this end, 1 Kings 10. 9. It was the
honor of the Kings of Egypt, that they bound their Judges by Oath, not to act
unjustly, no though they themselves should command them so to do. Clothing is
an Ornament, and Diadem is a glory; The first thing we do in a morning, is to
put on our clothes; before we eat or drink, we do this: So should every good
Magistrate prefer public Justice before his own private affairs, much more
before his Jades, his kites, his Curs and pleasures. D. Sanderson 1. Ser. ad
Magistratum. p. 155.
all Magistrates like Job should put on righteousness as a robe, and judgment
as a Diadem. Job 29. 14. So did Christ, Isa. 11. 5. This was David's honor,
that he executed Justice and Judgment to all his people, 2 Chronicles. 18. 14. This
is so lovely a thing, that Absclom when he would entice the people from David,
tells them, that if he were made Judge in the Land (though David did not) Yet
he would do them justice, 2 samuel 15. 4. As Injustice is all Vice, so Justice
comprehends (...). A is it. Etbick. l. 5.
all Virtue, so excellent a thing is Justice. This is our duty, Micah 6. 8. as
every man in his place must do justly, so specially the Magistrate.

Amos 5. 15. There is no one thing (religion excepted) that does more secure

it is a Prop to make it subsist firm in it self, and as a Crown to render it
glorious in the eyes of others. It Is as the Cement in the building, which holds
all together. Take this away, and Nations will quickly run to ruin, E^ resp ad
interitum inclinant in quibuss bo^i a malis ^hil disferunt. Antisthenes.
Ier. 5. 1. and 21. 12. Gall is bitter, and Hemlock is poisonous; now when
Judgment is turned into Gall, and righteousness into Hemlock, judgment is not
far from that people, Hos. 10. 4. Amos 6. 12. The Law thunders out curses
against such as pervert judgment, specially the judgment of the fatherless
and the widow, Deuteronomy 27. 19. Prove. 24. 24.

3. It Is our Glory. Righteousness exalts a Nation, Prove. 14. 34. and brings a
blessing on it. Tlse Lord bless thee O habitation of justice, Ier. 31. 33. So
that what Solomon says of Wisdom is most true of Justice, Exalt her and she
shall exalt thee to honor, she shall be to thee an Ornament of grace, and a
Crown of glory shall she deliver to thee, Prove. Pinguior (...) mactari Deo noil

Magistrates to do Justice, in Mr. Taffy ^ on Amendment, p. 122. 354. and ten

74, 75.
Isa. 1. 15. Amos 5. 21, 24. and our prayers in vain, Josh. 7. 20.

A Heathen could say, that the choicest gift that ever God gave to man
(considering what miseries he is subject to) was government by justice, Plat^
de Repub. lib. 4.
which bridleth and reftraineth the presumption of the furious, preserves the
innocent in his honesty, and yields equally to every man his due.

Now that Justice may be rightly dispensed to all, seven rules must be observed.

Do Justice
1. Discreetly. 2. Speedily. 3. Impartially and Universally. 4. Resolutely and
Courageously. 5. Righteously and Exactly. 6. Soberly. 7. Diligently.
1. A good Magistrate will execute justice Discreetly; he is not rash nor
heady, but he ponders all Circumstances of person, time, and place, and judges
accordingly. Now as a word spoken in season, (or as it is in the fountain) a word
set upon its wheels, having a due concurrence of all Circumstances, (...) super
rotis su^.
is like Apples of Gold in pictures of Silver, not only ly delightful to the
eye, but profitable to the possessor; ( Prove. 25. 11.) so an act of Justice
rightly circumstantiated is both pleasant and profitable. He must not regard
bare accusations, In capital causes especially del^beration must be used. V
Godwi^ I^^wish An^iq. lib. 5. cap. 6. p. 195.
for who then should be innocent? Christ himself was accused for a Blasphemer
and an Enemy to Caesar, and the Apostles were called Deceivers, and yet they
were true men, (2 Cor. 6. 8.) Besides wicked men are very subtle in
concealing, forging and wrapping up their sinful practices,( Micah 7. 3.) but
a Prudent Magistrate will sift and search out the truth of a matter. ( De^t.
17. 4. Job 29. 16.) For want of this, wise David was overseen, and gave away
good Mephib^sheths estate unheard, upon the bare accusation of a self-seeking
Ziba,(2 S^^. 19. 29.) and it was hard to censure Queen Vash^i before she was
heard speak for her self, Hester 1. 19. It Was good counsel (and he did practice
it himself) which Al^xander gave to his Judges, that when they had heard one
party speak, they should stop one ear to hear what the other party could say
for himself. See more Directions in Mr. Lawson his Body of Divinity, on the
ninth Commandment. p. 221, etc.
It Is folly to speak before we know the depth of the matter before us, Prove. 18.
13. God will have both parties heard, Exodus 22. 9.

2. Speedily. He must expedite causes, and not make a long harvest of a little
crop. Delay often makes the remedy worse then the disease. To tire out the poor,
the fatherless and the widow with redious suits and dilatory courses till they
have no means left to prosecute their righteous cause, is an act of great
unrighteousness. Christ is described (and a Magistrate cannot follow a better
copy) to be one that seeks judgment, and executes justice speedily, Isa.
16. 5. So did David, Psalm 101. ult.. As it is ill to do right rashly, so it is a
wrong to do it delayingly; and as they do a double courtesy who do it
speed^ly, so they do double right who do it (though discreetly and
deliberately) yet quickly. When the Poor woman petitioned Philip King of
Macedon to hear her cause; he answered, that he was not at leisure; then (said
she) Be ^ut King: The King laying to heart her speech, gave speedy audience,
not only to her, but to all men from that day forward: and the Emperor Tr^ jan
on horseback ready to go to battle, alighted to hear the complaint of a poor
woman.

Impartially and Universally to All* without fear of foes, or favor to
friends. As Gods justice knows no Relations, Exuit personam iud^cis, quisquis
amici (...). Ci^ero
( Isa. 27. 11. Ier. 22. 4, 24.) So Magistrates in point of Justice must know
none. Levi (in this case) did know neither Father nor Mother, Brethren nor
Children, (Deuteronomy 33. 9.) David punished his Abs^lom with a three years banishment
for his sratricide, 1 Kings 13. 38. King Asa deposed his own Mother for her
Idolatry, 1 Kings 15. 13. and that resolution of Saul was Heroic (if it had
been well grounded) Though the fault be found in Jonathan my Son, he shall
surely dye, (1 Samuel 14. 39.) It Is excellent, but hard, to censure those we love.
It Is the causes Equit^* and not the persons Intimacy that must sway us; if the
person be wicked, though he be never so nearly rela^ed to thee, Punish him; as
that Noble Roman did his Son for siding with Cataline Te Patri^ genui, non
Catalinae; and as that man who pleaded kindred, My Lord I am your Kinsman (said
the prisoner) Are you so? said the Judge; why then you shall have a higher
Gibber erected, (...)
that all the world may see that I will do Justice to a Kinsman. When Zaleucus
had made a Law against Adulterers, that whosoever should be found guilty
thereof, Exocularetur, he should have his eyes put out: It so fell out, that
his Son was the first offender: whereupon sentence was pronounced, and
execution ready to be done; The people entreating the Judge his Father to
pardon the fault, upon deliberation he put out one of his own eyes, and one of
his Sons, and so showed himself Pium Patrem, and justum Iudicem; a good Father,
and a just Judge. As Aristotle said sometimes, Amicus Secrates, etc. S^cr^^tes
I love, and Plato I love, but I love the truth above them all: So say you, My
friends I love, my kindred I love, my children I love, but Justice and
Judgment I love above them all. Justice is pictured blind with a Sword in one
hand, V. Plutarch de Iside.
and a balance in the other; it cannot see a Rich man from a poor, nor a
friend from a foe. It makes not the Law like a Spiders Web, which catcherh
little Flies, whilst the great ones break through. It knows that one sinner
(one Achan, one S^ul, one Ahab unpunisht destroys much good, Eccles, 9. ult.

4. Resolutely and Courageously. Judges must not fear the faces or the frowns
of any: for the Judgment is the Lords which they execute, who will defend them
in it, Magistrates must be Anschci Cha^^l, Viri vir^^tis, Valiant men.
Exodus 18. 21. Deuteronomy. 1. 17. Nehem^ah (Chap. 6. 11.) will not fear not fly, but
stands it out against all the Plots and Power of Sanballat and his
confederates. Gods Joshua's and Zerubbabels must be strong and of good courage,
^udex neminem ti^e at nis^ se^psum.
Joshua 1. 9. Hag. 2. 4. Hence Constantine is styled a man-child for his
courage, See many Reasons why Magistrates should be courageous in Dr.
Sandersons 1 ^er. ad Magistratum. p. 176, etc.
in venturing for the Churches Weal. The Lord himself is a Shield and Sanctuary
to the Shields of the earth: he is on their side, and therefore they should not
fear what man can do unto them ( Psalm. 56. 5. and 118. 6.) Inferior creatures
when backed by a Superior, are full of spirit. A little Dog will venture on a
creature far stronger then himself, Fiat justitia, and ^uat mu^dus.
when his Master stands by to back him. Do Justice faithfully, and then let the
world fall on thee, it shall never hurt thee; if any dare to do injustice, do
not thou fear to do Justice on him. Solomon's Throne was upheld by See how
Magistrates must be like Lions in seven particulars, in M. John Carters Ser. at
No^wich on Revel. 5. 5. p. 120. Styled the Lion.
not by fearful Hearts and Hares (2 Kings 10. 20. 2 Chronicles. 9. 18, 19.)
intimating that Magistrates should be such for magnanimity and courage. The
Pillars of an house had need to be heart of Oak; Magistrates are the Pillars of
a land, and therefore had need to be solid, seasoned, resolute, undaunted men,
that will not warp for fear or favor, for Threats or Gifts. These Shields of
the earth must look for Darts sometimes from Superiors, anon from Inferiors,
and if they be not well steeled, to flatter the one, or please the other, they
will fail in duty. None but noble raised spirits can hold out in doing well,
Been ^acere, and (...) audire, regium est. Seneca.
though they hear ill for their pains. There are three dogs which Luther would
not have Ministers to bring into the Pulpit with them. Viz.
Envy. Pride. Coverousness.
And there are three sins which no Magistrate should bring to the Seat of
Justice with him. Viz.
Pufillanimity. Malice and Anger. Covetuousness.


1. A Pusillanimous man dares not say nay to an unrighteous motion for fear of
the displeasure of the people, or of some great man. It was their sin that
condemned Naboth for fear of displeasing Ieztbel; It is a good clause which I
have read in Minshew, that in the Oaths of the Kings Justices, They shall swear
to do right, notwithstanding the Kings Letters. An. 18. ^dw. 3. 4.
and Pilate for fear of Caesar condemned Christ, though he found him innocent,
and knew that he was delivered to him of envy. Paul's cause was good, yet Felix
will not free him, because of the people. Darius to please his Princes, sends
Daniel to the Lions Den, though with some regret. So King Zedekiah overawed by
his Princes, delivers Jeremy into their hands, Ier. 38. 5. Inordinate fears are
very prejudicial to men in Public places: such fear slaies a man whilst he
lives, and buries him before he is dead, Isa. 22. 2. it enfeebles and dispirits
a man, so that he cannot act so freely as becomes him. The fear of man is a
snare, (...). Aris^ot.
( Prove. 29. 25.) and every coward (says Aristotle) is a murderer. As all
Christians, so Magistrates then especially had need to be men of good courage;
See Mr. Ash his Ser. on Psalm. 31. 24 preached 1642.
and the rather, because they must oppose the Torrent and current of the sins
of the times they live in.

2. Malice and Anger become not a Judge. Spite will never do right. Malice puts
men upon revenge. Micaiah must to prison though he prophecy nothing but truth:
and why so? for I hate him, Affectus u^i judicat, ibi ratio claudicat; and ubi
est fervid^ vindicta, ibi no^ temperata ^ustitia.
said Ahab. Aristides (though a Heathen) said well; when sitting as Judge
between two persons, the one charged his adversary with great wrongs done to
Aristides; he answered, Friend, tell me only what he has done to thee, for I
sit here to do right to thee, and not to my self.

3. Covetousness. A Magistrate must not only be free from it, but he must h^te
it, Exodus 18. 21. a man that is greedy of gain, will Transgress for a morsel of
bread. (Prove. 28. 21.) a poor reward will put him out of his way. This sin is
the root of all evil, Bribery, Symonie, Sacrilege, Partiality, Tyranny,
Time-serving and turning of Judgment backward; ( Isa. 5914.) these are some of
those fruits of this bitter root. Such will sell their Wit, Parts, Power,
Conscience, Religion and all for money. I have read of many Sa^es, as
Sale-winds by V. Heylings Geogra. in Lapland.
Witches, Salechurches by Patrons or rather Latrons, Sale-hands by Mercenary
Soldiers; but Sale-Justice and a Salesentence is one of the worst Sales, for it
makes the just man a sinner, and takes away the righteousness of the righteous
from him. This Solomon looked upon as a Non in homines debent imperium hab re,
sedin belluas qui publ^co^um Officiorum Functionibus, non quid ex us^ sit
publico, sed quid rei private serviat, quaerunt. Luther.
great evil, Eccles. 3. 16 he saw the place of Judgment, and lo wickedness was
there. To find wickedness in Taverns, Theaters, or Mountains of prey, is no
wonder; but for Seats of Justice to be full of Injustice, this is gall and
hemlock indeed, Amos 6. 12. These love Diclectum Doricam, They love (...), dona.
the Dorick Dialect (as one phraseth it) they are all for gif^s, like those in
Hosea's time, ( Hos. 4. 18.) her Rulers with shame love Give ye, i. e. in a
shameful sordid manner they call for Gifts and Presents, Siquis honorem verum
amet, ab omni suspicione captandorum munerum sedulo ca^^bit, praesertim in ^o
constitutus loco, in quo maxim cavendum ne iniquitas venalis fiat. Rivet.

Hab, Hab; Give, Give, Prove. 30. 15. but will you see the end of such bribers?
why fire shall consume their Tabernacles, Job 15. 34.

5. Righteously and exactly. A Magistrate must not only be Iustus, but he must
do Iusta, yea and he must do them Just. He must hear both parties speak, and
then judge righteously between them. They must not wrest nor wrack the Law, to
make it speak what it never meant, but with just judgment must they judge the
people, L^v. 19. 15. Z^ch. 8. 16. He must dispense justice carefully,
constantly, and conscientiously. Justice, Justice he must do, i. e. pure
justice ( Iustitiam, Iustitiam i. e. justissimam and puram justtiam. Piscator.
See SchoolsGuard, Rule 43
Deuteronomy. 16. 20.) not seeming, but real justice; not Justice in part, but entire
Justice in measure and degree, without passion, corruption or delay. He must
not do an act or two of justice, but it must be his constant work; Iudex ni^il
aliud est qua^ (...) i. e. Ius quoddam a^imat^m. Arist.
it is his clothing which he must put on every day. His head, and heart and
hands must be covered with it, Job 28. 14. Rulers must not free Ravens, and
censure Doves; Distinguendum es^ inter poenam sceleram ^ure divino definitam,
and arbitrio Magistratus relictam. Quoad illam servanda est aequalitas
Arithmetica, quoad hanc Geo^etrica. Gerhard.
nor loose Barrabas, and bind Christ. This is not execution of justice, but
persecuting of the just. They must proportion the punishment according to the
offense, and not barely shave the Head, which for its enormities ought be (...)
off. There must be an Accurate, Arithmetical, and Geometrical proportion
observed, i. e. the fact with all its circumstances must be considered, and
there must be a Retaliation rendered accordingly. Great sins must have great
punishment, and lesser sins lesser punishment. Life must for Life, and Eye for
Eye, Genesis 9. 6. Exodus 21. 24.

6. Soberly. He must be a Temperate man, else how will he govern others, that
cannot govern himself; or reform others, who is unreformed himself? What the
Apostle says of Ministers, is true of Magistrates; if a man cannot rule
himself and his own house, how shall he govern the house of God? 1 Timothy 3. 5.
He is not like to help another who has lost himself. Wine and Strong drink
make men forget the Law, In sicco habitat sapientia, non in humid^; fundame^tum
ejus est temperantia. Socrates.
and pervert judgment. It Is not for Princes to be eating in the morning when
they should be judging the people, Eccles. 10. 16, 17. Ier. 21. 12. Judges must
be wise and prudent: but when Temperance is gone, where is the Prudence? He
that is luxurious and riotous, is not wise, says the wisest of men, Prove. 20.
1. and therefore Scl^n made a Law, that whatever Ruler was found drunk, should
be put to death.

7. Diligently. It Is Gods work, Sudandum est^iis qui Magistratum gerunt; adeunde
inimicitiae, subeundae saepe p^o Republica tempestates, cum mul^s audacibus,
improbis, non^unquam etiam p^t^ntibus dimicandum est. Cicero pro Sestert.
and he is cursed that does it negligently. Justice must diffuse it self: it
must run down as a mighty stream fully, freely, commonly and universally, (
A^os 5. 24.) Rivers run by the Poor man's door as well as the rich. It must be
their delight to do judgment, Prove. 21. 15. Rulers were not made for pleasure
but for labor. They were not born for themselves, but for the peoples good;
hence those Titles of Nursing Fathers, Shepherds, Stewards, etc. all which
imply a great deal of care and pains.

Observation 3.
Good duties need much pressing. Such is the dullness and indisposition of our
natures to the best things, that without much pressing they take little or no
Impression upon us: hence, it is that the Lord here calls on Judges again and
again to defend the poor and fatherless, and to deliver the needy out of
trouble. So Rev. 2. and 3. Christ calls again and again to hose that have ears
to hear what the Spirit says to the Churches. We ^ust have line upon line, and
precep^ upon precept, and all little enough to make the word effectual. ^is
not sufficient to say, I know this and that, but you must love to hear it pressed
upon you again and again, for your more sp^ritual improvement of it. Verit^s
quo notior, ^o cha^or.
He that loves the truth in truth, the more he hears it, the more he loves it
still. It Is but an Adulterous love to Virgin truth, to be weary of her when you
are best acquainted with her, and to cast her off with contempt (as Amnon did
Tamar) when you have had your fill of her.

Observation 4.
Magistrates must administer justice orderly. They must not go preposterously
to work, and condemn a man before he is heard. But 1. They must fully, freely,
patiently, with a sedate, quiet, composed spirit, free from Passion, prejudice
and precipitancy, hear both parties speak for themselves: for the Law does not
use to condemn men till their cause be heard, John 7. 51. Acts 25. 15, 16. 2.
When upon hearing he has found out the depth and truth of the cause, then he
must justisie and absolve the innocent, and rescue him out of the jaws of the
wicked, by executing Justice on him according to his demerits.

Observation 5.
God is very tender over his poor afflicted people. This makes him here once
and again to charge his Vicegerents to have a special care over them. None must
touch them to hurt them: or if they do, the Magistrate must rescue them; and if
they will not, yet God himself will, Psalm. 12. 5. he takes the wrongs that are
done to them as done to himself. Prove. 14. 31. and 17. 5. he that oppresses
the poor, reproacheth his maker, and contemns the wise dispensation of God who
will have poor intermingled with the rich, as the Vallyes are amongst the
Hills, for his own praise. God would have no man oppressed, be he never so rich:
but specially he hates the oppres^ing of the poor, because low and weak, and
cannot help themselves as rich men can. The more unable they are to help
themselves, the sooner will God arise to help them: though they be weak, yet
their Red^emer is strong, Prove. 23. 10, 11. Gobel, (...). Redemptor. A Lapide
in locum.
Though they be little, yet their Protector is mighty: you may be able to
contend with the Poor, but can you contend with the Allmighty who is their
Guardian? No wise man will contend with a mightier then himself, See more on
this point in Mr. Gatakers ^er. on Psalm. 82. 7. P. 103, 104* 2 Parl, folio.
nor oppress the Servants and Sons of a Prince that can easily suppress and
crush him. The poor and fatherless (when believers) are the Sons and Servants
of God, and they cannot escape that wrong them: he has more then once
proclaimed himself their Patron and Protector, Psalm. 10. 14. and 68. 5. Hosea
14. 3. Deuteronomy. 10. 17, 18. and has denounced woes against those that hurt them,
Isa. 10. 1, 2, 3. Mal. 3. 5. and punished Jerusalem amongst other sins for this,
Ez^k. 22. 7. Many think they may abuse the poor, because they are impotent and
cannot help themselves: but see how Solomon counsels these men most excellently
Prove. 22. 22, 23. Rob not the poor because he is poor, neither oppress the
afflicted in the gate: for the Lord will plead their cause, and spoil the soul
of those that spoiled them; q. d. let not his poverty and inability to
with-stand thee, encourage thee to abuse him; yea though thou be one of the
Magistra^es, a man of power that sit in the gate, yet know, that there is a
greater then thou, who will help the helpless, will plead their cause, and
spoil the soul of those that spoiled them, i. e. he will take away the life of
those that take away the estate of the afflicted.

Observation 6.
Oppressors of the poor are cruel Beasts. They get the poor in their clutches,
and as the Woolffeeds on his prey, so do they on them, ( Psalm. 17. 12.) till
the Magistrate by his power do rescue them. Hence for their ferity they are
compared to Lions, Job 4. 10. W^lves, Hab. 7. 8. Bears, Prove. 17. 12. Dogs,
Math. 7. 6. Wild Boars, Psalm. 80. 13. To Milners, that grind the poor by their
cruelty, Isa. 3. 15. To Threshers, which bruise and oppress the people. Amos 1.
3. To Butchers, that do not fleece but flay the Sheep, Micah. 3. 2, 2. hence
their teeth are called Swords, and their jaw-teeth knives; that they may at
once devour the poor from off the earth, Prove. 30. 14. Psalm. 57. 4. The fourth
Beast in Daniels Vision had great Iron teeth, (Dan. 7. 7.) he had teeth, great
teeth, Iron teeth, and all to note what ^poil that Beast should make amongst
the Nations.

Observation 7.
Magistrates must improve their power in rescuing the poor out of the Paws of
the Oppressor. To this end they have their power given them, not to oppress the
oppressed, or to add affliction to the afflictions of the afflicted; but that
they might resemble God, who is a Father to the Fatherless, and the poor Man's
Resuge. Hence they are called Shepherds; As the Shepherd defends the flock, and
rescues his Lambs from Lions and Wolves; so must the Magistrate by his power
defend the Lambs of Christ from the Sons of Violence. So did Job, Chap. 29. 17.
he brake the Jaws of the wicked, and pulled the spoil out of his teeth.

Observation 8.
Merciless men are wicked men. Those that oppress the poor have this brand set
upon them, that they are Reshagnanim, wicked men. As Tenderness, Pity and
Mercifulness are signs of Election, ( Col. 3. 12.) so ferity, cruelty and
harshness are signs of Reprobation, as we see in Nabal, and Dives. See how Job
describes the wicked, by enumerating their unmercifull practices, Job 24. 2. to
12.

Observation 9.
Rich men (oft-times) are oppressive men. These wicked men that the Prophet
speaks of, were not poor men, for they have not the power that rich men have to
oppress their Brethren; neither do Judges use to respect the persons of the
poor, as they did these, Verse 2. Riches accidentally make men cruel and
insolent. The Rich (says Solomon) rules over the poor, viz. with Insolence and
Violence, Prove. 22. 7. It were rich men that oppressed the poor, and drew them
(violently) before Judgment Seats, James 2. 6. so as when these wicked ones
arise, (especially to be Rulers) the poor, especially the Godly poor, hide
themselves, Proverbs 28. 28.

VERSE 5.
They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in the darkness; All
the foundations of the earth are out of course.
THis Verse is a kind of Parenthesis, and contains the Lords Pathetical
complaint of that ignorance, stupidity and obstinacy which he found in the
Judges of those times; together with the sad effects of it in the
Commonwealth; The foundations of the earth were out of course.

In this Verse the person is changed; God speaks not here to the Magistrates
themselves, as he did Verse 2. He says not, Ye do not know, ye do not
understand; but as one troubled in mind, and mourning within himself to see
their desperate malice, and the confusions that attended it, he cries out, Lo
Jadegnu, N^n cognoverunt. Praeterit in Kal.
They have not known, they have no understanding, i. e. they do not know nor
understand. It is frequent in that language to put the Praeterperfect Tense for
the Present Tense; as Psalm 1. 1. Blessed is the man who has not walked, i. e.
who does not walk in the counsel of the ungodly. It notes a continued act, and
implies their perseverance in ignorance; Prae^erita (...) propraesen^e and not
ant actum (...). Piscator.
q. d. But what do I mean? Why go I about to make a blackmore white? It Is in
vain to reprove this kind of men, or to exhort them to the study of
righteousness; for they grow worse and worse; they are so blinded, stupefied
and hardened in their sin, that they will go on in their dark and sinful
courses, though they ruin themselves, and the Commonwealth to boot.

In the words we have all the Degrees of Comparison, and in them the character
of evil Judges: 1. These corrupt Judges were blind: They know not, that is bad.
2. They will not understand, that is worse. 3. They will walk on in their own
dark courses, that is worst of all. 4. Though the whole world be in confusion,
and the very foundations of the earth shake under them, partly through their
own mis-government, and partly by the just judgment of God, yet they were
stupid and senseless, they took no notice of it, so as to amend what was amiss,
but went on still in their perverse Practices, till all came to confusion. And
this is Super-superlative wickedness.

1. Their first Degree of evil is Ignorance, they know not. They were wise
enough to do evil, but to do good they had no knowledge.

Question.
But here a Question may arise; Since these men were Judges in Israel, and had
Parts, with answerable breeding (no doubt) to fit them for such weighty
employment, how then is it said, They know not, neither do they understand?

Answer.
The answer is easy. Knowledge is twofold, Speculative, or Practical. These
Judges were not fools and ignorant of their duty, they had a Theoretical,
Notional, Speculative knowledge of it; they knew that they were Gods
Vicegerents and Deputies appointed by him to execute Justice and Judgment
amongst his people impartially, and that they ought to have a tender respect to
the poor and the afflicted; and if they did not thus, they knew that God would
punish them. All this no doubt and much more they had in the Theory, having so
many Prophets as the people of Israel had to instruct them.

2. But if we look upon their Practice, Verba nolitiae apud Hebraeo^, a^fectus
comprehendunt. See Schools G^rd. Rule 11.
so it may be said they have no knowledge, viz. so as to love, affect and
practice what they know. In Scripture, Knowledge without Practice is counted no
Knowledge; and Hypocritical false things are esteemed as no things. The word
Iadang (in the Text) implies both knowledge with the mind, and acknowledging
and regarding with the Affections.
Thus graceless men are accounted as no men, Ier. 5. 1. Run to and fro through
the streets of Jerusalem, and see if ye can find a man. Why, the streets were
full of men: yea but because they were not good men, God accounts them as no
men. Thus the wicked are said to have no Heart, Hos. 7. 11. i. e. no heart to
goodness, and then as good have no heart at all. Thus the wicked are said not
to hear the Law, because they do not hear it rightly, and obedientially. Thus
Saul is said to reign but two years over Israel, when he reigned many years:
but because in his two first years he reigned well, and after did degenerate,
therefore his last reigning was accounted as no reigning. So these Judges,
though they knew they should judge righteously, without respect of persons; yet
they did judge unrighteously, with respect to persons; and therefore God
accounted their Knowledge as no Knowledge: They Know not.

Neither do they Understand. They were stupid and incapable of good counsel.
Iabinu, from Binah inteltexit, consideravit, Pagnin.
They did not Understand or consider (so much the word imports in the Original)
the duties of their places, so as to practice them for the good of Gods poor,
afflicted, oppressed people. The word is frequently used for consideration, as
1 King. 3. 21. when I had considered it in the morning. So Isa. 14. 16. and 43.
18. Consider the things of old, Ier. 2. 10. 23. 20. In the latter days ye
shall consider it perfectly. So Job 23. 15. and 37. 14. Consider the wondrous
works of God, so as to be affected with them.

They walk on in darkness. The words in the Fountain are very Emphatical. It Is
not halla^u, ambularunt, but Iithhallacu, ambalabu^t indesinenter. Nam verbain
con^ugatione Hithpael significationem intendunt, immo habitum, vehementiam and
frequentiam denotant. Pagnin.
They will walk on continually in darkness. They take not a turn or two in this
dark Alley, but indesinenter ambulant, they are always at it, it is their
work, their way, their Trade, and no man nor means can put them out of it. They
will walk on and continue in their wilful ignorance and sinful perverting of
Judgment in despite of God and man. Now to walk in darkness, in Scripture
phrase notes, O^^endit ignorantiam istoram judicum fuisse voluntar^am, ut qui
noluerint ex lege Dei discere quid sui ess^t officu: Piscator.
1. A living in Ignorance, (Eccles. 2. 14.) when men care not to know the will
of God, but say as those wicked in Job 21. 14. Depart from us, for we desire
not the knowledge of thy ways. These corrupt Judges walked in ways of
darkness, and therefore they loved darkness more then light. This made them err
in judgment, as blind men stumble at every thing that lies in their way; and
hence came that sedition, tumult and confusion in the State. 2. To walk in
darkness, is to lie in a natural condition, and live in a state of sin and
ignorance, without any saving knowledge of God, John 8. 12. and 12. 46. 1 John
1. 6. and 2. 11. Prove. 2. 13. 1 John 1. 6. and 2. 11. By nature these men were
blind, but being drunken with pleasures, and besotted with the lusts of
covetousness, bribery, private affection, and pust up with the greatness of
their power, they had contracted an habitual blindedness, so that they could
not diseern right from wrong, darkness from light, nor truth from error. Their
lusts had blinded them, and put out their eyes, so that they could not see the
duties of their places, nor remember the great account which they must one day
give unto God of their Stewardship: but as Sampson when he had lost his eyes
was abused and put to grind in a Mill; so these being blinded by Satan, were
made to grind in the Mill of every sin and error.

All the Foundations of the earth are out of course. These words have almost as
many Interpretations as there be Interpreters. 1. Some add the word (albeit or
although) to the Text, They walk on in darkness, albeit the foundations of the
earth be moved: and so they make these words an Aggravation of that prodigious
stupidity which had possessed those great ones of the world. q. d. Such is their
sottishness and senselesness, that though all the world be in confusion, and
heaven and earth be ready to come together, yet do they snort in their
security, and will by no means be quickened to the execution of justice, that
they might prevent destruction.

This sense is good, but with submission to better judgments, I conceive the
words may be taken as they are in themselves, without any Addition, for the sad
effect and consequent of that ignorance, unrighteousness, cruelty and stupidity
which reigned in their Rulers, Iimm^^u (a Mot.) nutabunt, declinabunt omnia
fundamenta terrae, Mercer. apud Pagnin.
viz. that by reason of it all the foundations of the earth were out of course,
i. e. all Laws were broken, all Orders violated, the wicked were encouraged,
Fundamenta terre videtur nominare ea quibus salus publica nititur; ea ver o
sunt recta administratio juris, conservatio disciplinae and pacis, defensio
innocentum, and poen^ sc^ler^m. Moller.
the godly discountenanced, the public Peace disturbed, and the state of all
things turned upside down: nothing but murder, rapes, rapine, violence and all
outrage to be found: no man knows where to have right, or by whom to be
protected from wrong. Yet they know not, neither will they understand, they
will walk on in darkness; and what is the issue of all this? why, the very
foundations of the earth will move. (So it is in the Original) i. e. all things
will run into confusion and disorder by reason of the stupidity and wilful
disobedience of the Rulers of this people, ( Psalm. 60. 2. Isa. 24. 19, 20.)
Others make the words a Commination of some destruction at hand, Manisesle
dicitur de Principibus a justitia and pietate declinantibus, qui moveri, i. e.
non consistere in vera via, and statione dicun^ur; ideo ill^^ graves minatur
poenas. Illyricus.
the foundations of the earth shall be moved, (they read the word Passively) q.
d. God will destroy that Nation where such ill Magistrates bear sway: as a
house whose foundation is taken away cannot stand; so since the Rulers of my
people who should be the Upholders of the Land by executing justice, are become
the destroyers of it, I will destroy them altogether. But the former sense is
most genuine: for although the Septuagint do frequently render the Verb
Passively, yet why we should forsake the Original (as the Vulgar Latin
frequently does, to follow the Septuagint) I see no Reason; especially if we
consider the corruptness of the Septuagint which now we have. Take but one
place for instance, Isa. 9. 6. speaking of Christ, the Septuagint put (...),
for Deus, and leave out many of Christ's Titles there, which prove his Deity. I
speak not in the least to disparage that Pincely work of that Reverend and
Learned man whose labors praise him in the gates, Dr. walton.
and for which I desire to bless the God of heaven, and have long since
received it with a (...). But I speak it to this end to caution young men not
to lay too much stress upon the Septuagint, considering what the Learned have
said of it. Ista Graeca Versio quam nunc habemus, in plurimis loc is dissentit

But this point is so excellently cleared by the Learned Dr. Walton in his
Apparatus, See Mr. Leigh his Body of Divinity. l. 1. 6. 7. p. 72.
Prolegom. 9. that I shall only refer you thither for better satisfaction.

IN the words is set forth to us, 1. What it is that is out of course? The
Earth, i. e. Met. S^bjecti.
The Inhabitants of the earth.

2. What part of the earth? not the Superficies or Surface, but the very
foundation of the earth, It Is an Hyperbolical P^overbial Metaphor.
by which Metaphorically is meant the due administration of Justice in
punishing the wicked and defending the good. These be the Pillars that uphold
the world, and upon these Commonwealths are chiefly founded.

3. Here is the extent of this confusion; not some but all the foundations of
the earth are out of course. Those that should be the Pillars of the earth,
they are rotten Posts that deceive the building and let all run to ruin.

Observation 1.
All reprehensions and admonitions that are bestowed on wilfully blind and
obstinate sinners, are lost, and in vain (as to the parties reproved, though
our labor be not vain in the Lord; See Mr. Lysords Ser on 2 Cor. 2. 15.
Isa. 49. 4. 2. Cor. 2. 15.) we do but wash a Black-more, or wash a Tile; the
more rain is poured on it, Laterem lavarc. Proverb.
the blacker it grows. When men are set, given up and wedded to their sins, it
is time to let them alone, Hos. 4. 14, 17. This made the Lord here leave
off-complaing to these Judges, and to turn his complaint to himself and to his
people. They know not, they will not understand. God will not honor them now
so far as to reprove them. Thus did the Prophets when men were obstinate, past
Counsel and Instruction, they turned to the earth and called upon the inanimate
creatures to hear, Isa. 1. 2. Hear O Heavens, and give ear O earth! So Micah 6.
2. Hear O Mountains the Lords controversy, So Deuteronomy. 4. 26. and 32. 1. Ier. 6.
19, and 22. 29. That Preacher thinks his people very bad indeed, who directs
his speech to the seats they sit on, and the Pillars they lean too; q. d. Hear
O ye Seats, and hearken O ye Pillars what the Lord has done for an Ungrateful
and Rebellious people. These are scorners that do but jeer at such as call on
them to live Soberly, Righteously and Religiously. Solomon bids not reprove
such lest they hate us, Prove. 9. 8. These are Dogs that fly in the face of such
as go about to stop them in their sinful practices, Mat. 7. 6.

Question.
But is not this a sufficient excuse to make us cease from reproving sinners?

Answer.
No; for the Holy Ghost before in this Psalm though he knew those he spoke to
were incorrigible and incurable, yet reproves them first and admonishes them
to do their duty, verse 2. 3. 4. for though such wicked men be not amended, yet
we have discharged our duty, and they will be left without excuse in the day of
the Lord, when they shall see and say they had a Prophet amongst them to warn
them, Ezekiel. 2. 9.

2. We must be very cautious that we do not presently cast off every wicked man
as a Dog, See this Point fully stated by Mr. Reyner in his Government of the
Tongue, p. 170, etc.
that frets at reproof; (for a good Asa may do so, 2 Chronicles. 16. 9, 10.) The
Lord himself is patient and bears long, and loath he is to cast off his people,
And Mr. Chudworth on Galat. 6. 1. p. 351, etc.
Hos. 6. 4. Now when the Lord bears, we may well bear; but he bears with much
long-suffering the vessels of wrath who are fitted to destruction, Romans 9. 22.

Observation 2.
Ignorance is the Mother of mischief. These Judges judge Unjustly, respect
persons, neglect their duties, oppress the poor, etc. but what was the cause of
all this? he tells you, They know not, neither will they under stand. This in
Scripture is often set forth as the Root of all sin, Hosea 4. 1, 2. there is no
mercy, no truth; nothing but killing, lying, stealing, and outrage; and why so?
why there is no knowledge of God in the Land. So Isa. 1. 3, 4. 1 Pet. 1. 14.
Revel. 3. 17. one great cause of the Church of Laodiceas misery was this, that
she knew not her misery. Ignorance and working uncleaness with greediness, are
joined together, Ephesians. 4. 18, 19. This made the Jews to crucify Christ, Acts
3. 17. I wot Brethren that through Ignorance ye did it: and Pa^l to blaspheme,
and persecute Gods people, 1 Timothy 1. 13. I did it ignorantly. When the Gentiles
knew not God, then they served Idols, Gal. 4. 8. Why is not God loved, feared,
obeyed? why because he is not known; for as incognitum non amatur, so non
timetur. Children that know not the strength and terror of a Lion, fear him
not. This made the Saduces to err, Mat. 22. 29. Ye err not knowing the
Scriptures. All sins and errors are Radically, Omnis malus coecus and ignor^ns.
Aristot.
Seminally, and Fundamentally in Ignorance. When the Apostle had said, There Is
none that understands, see what a black Guard of sins do follow, See more in
Mr. Pembles Ser. on Hos. 4. 6 The mischief of Ignorance, and Mr. Clerks Mirror.
Chap. 54.
Romans 1. 28. to 32. and 3. 11. to 19. when the eyes of the Jews were blinded,
then all wickedness like a stood broke in upon them, and there abides even to
this day, Romans 11. 8.

Ignorance is evil in any, but specially in such as are designed for public
service. A Magistrate that is ignorant of the Law, and a Minister of the
Gospel, are two sore judgments: the one destroys many a soul, and the other
mars many a good cause. A Prince that wants understanding is a great
Oppressor (says Solomon,) Prove. 28. 16. Its a great misery to a Nation when
the Rulers are children in understanding, Eccles. 10. 16. Isa. 3. 4.
Magistrates had need of abundance of Wisdom and Prudence; Sinners are subtle
to contrive wickedness, and Magistrates had need of Serpentine Wisdom to search
it out: For as Truth, so wickedness lies in profundo, its buried deep, Isa.
29. 15.

It Is not for Kings (say flatterers) to Read, Pray, Study; they must Hawk and
Hunt, and Game and take their pleasure; as if God had made them for no other
end in the world, but as he has done the Leviathan in the Sea, to take his
pleasure therein, Psalm. 104. 26. No, God commands Kings to Write, Read and
Study his Law, Deuteronomy. 17. 18, 19. It must be their Vade mecum, their constant
companion, which they must study as well as the Laws of the Land. It Is necessary
that Rulers should see with their own eyes, that they be not seduced by
flatterers and Parasites. We read how Moses the chief Magistrate was instructed
in all the wisdom of the Egyptians before he was called to Government. Tongues,
Arts, Sciences, Philosophy, History, Law, Divinity, are all requisite to make a
complete Magistrate. How necessary all kind of knowledge is, See a Lapide,
Encomium Sapientiae Ethices, Naturalis, and Divinae. In Prefat. ad
Ecclesiasticum. p. 1, 2. etc.
They must not only be Honest men, but Able men, (Exodus 18. 21.) men of Parts,
Gifts and Understanding, (Deuteronomy. 1. 13.) Men (as we say) cut out for the work;
for as every one that is Godly is not fit to teach others; so every one that
has Grace is not fit to Rule others. They must be men dextrous in the Law,
else how shall they direct others according to Law? When Rulers are children in
gifts, though men in years, and babes for Understanding, being weak as women,
then follows oppression and confusion, Isa. 3. 4, 5, 12. As no wise man will go
to an unskilful Physician for Physic; nor venture himself in that Ship that
has an unskilful Pilot; So no man that is well in his wits will venture his
cause in the hands of an ignorant Judge. As unsavory salt is good for nothing;
so raw and rude Rulers are the Pests of their places.

Oservation 3.
Knowledge without Practice is no Knowledge in Gods esteem. (...) scimus,
quantum operamur.
In Divinity we know no more then we practice. To the Jews were committed the
Oracles of God, and they had great skill in the Letter of the Law; but because
they did not practice it, God complains of them as ignorant, Isa. 5. 13. Hos.
4. 6. Yea the Priests are said not to know the Law, 1. Sam: 2. 12. Ier. 2. 8.
and 4. 22. they were Priests and so could not be totally ignorant* M^lti habent
cognitionem salutis, sed non cog^itionem salutarem.
but because their knowledge was merely notional and speculative without
obedience and practice, therefore God accounted it as no knowledge. Thus cruel,
oppressing Rulers though they had some speculative knowledge, yet because they
hated the good, and loved the evil, they are said not to know judgment, viz.
so as to practice it, Ier. 10. 21. Micah 3. 1, 2. Prove. 29. 7.

Rest not then content with shows and shadows; Cognitio veritatis est duplex;
Pure Speculativa, vel Affectiva. Aquinas. V. Dyke on the Sacrament, chap. 4.
ushers Medications, p. 1.
let not Satan cozen thee with the leaves of speculation and external
profession; but let thy knowledge be an Affective, Practical, Obediential
knowledge; else knowledge without practice will but double your stripes, and
increase your condemnation, Luke 12. 47. John 9. ult. James 4. ult. Where the
Spirit of Regeneration comes, it brings a Light with it, (Ephesians. 1. 17, 18. and
5. 14.) not a natural, but a divine, supernatural Light; not a cold light, like
that of the Moon: but a burning light, like that of the Sun, See the Difference
between common and saing knowledge. Dr. Preston, Saints Infirmities, mi^i. p.
159, 160.
John 5. 35. it is not a sading, vanishing light, but it is an abiding, enduring
light, which all the Devils in Hell shall never extinguish. As the Joy, so the
Light of Gods elect (though it may be for a time ecclipsed, yet) shall never be
totally taken from them. A natural man may have a little glimmering twilight;
but this is a Soul-awaking, Sinconquering, Soul-convincing, Soul-commanding
light; it is effectual in the hearts of believers, and makes them grow in
grace, 2 Pet. 3. 18. There may be knowledge without grace, but there can be no
grace without knowledge. Knowledge is the oil in which the flame of the Spirit
lives. 1. It Is the saving knowledge of the truth that sanctifies us, and
delivers from the bondage of sin in which by nature we are entangled, John 8.
31, 32. and 17. 17. 2. It increases faith, Psalm. 9. 10. Quantum cog^^scimus,
tantum diligimus; qui^ dilectio sequitur cognitionem, cum ignoti nulla s^^
cupido.
they that know thee will trust in thee. 3. Twill make us love him more
intensively; the more experimentally we know God the more we shall love him.
Cant. 1. 4. 4. Twill make us patient under all afflictions, when we know and
see that the Lord corrects us for our profit, Heb. 12. 10. 5. Twill make us
slight these transitory things, when we are truly convinced of the Vanity of
them, Eccles. 1. 2. Heb. 11. 24, 25, 26.

Observation 4.
Want of consideration makes men n^glect the Duties of their c^llings. These
Judges did not consider that God sat amongst them, and considered their
sentences, ends and aims; this made them pass such unrighteous sentences.
Inconsiderateness makes sin a bound, L^m. 1. 9. They are sinners and fools that
consider not what they do, Eccles. 5. 1. This ruins Kings and Kingdoms, Isa.
1. 3, 4. and 5. 12. Ier. 12. 11. Hos. 7. 2. This ruined Eve; she no sooner saw
the fruit, but she presently eats of it without any consideration of the misery
that attended it, Genesis 3. 6. Did the Drunkard but consider the many woes that
attend that sin, See more in my Comment, on 2. Tim. 3. 4. p. 117, 118.
he would not rush into sin as the Horse into the Battle with such desperate
violence. So we may say of all other sinners, Ier. 8. 6.

Observation 5.
Wicked men are wilful men. They are obstinate in sin, and will walk on what
ever come on it. Had these Rulers sinned of mere simple Ignorance, it might
have excused them a tanto, though not a toto; it might have extenuated their
sin: Ignorantia crassa and affeetata ^us scire sper^it, ut liberius peccet;
haec aggravat peccatum, 1. Quia fit ex socordia, ut in otiofis. 2. Quia fit ex
philantia, ut in superbis. 3. Quia sit ex malitia ut in desperatis, quorum vox
est, Scientiam tuarum viarum ^olumus. Breerwood, Ethic. l. 3. p. 121.
but their Ignorance being a gross, wilful, affected and contracted ignorance,
rejecting instruction, that they might sin more freely, could neither excuse
them a tanto, nec a toto, not in the least, but it did highly aggravate their
wickedness. This is made a frequent Character of wicked men, that they are
wilful sinners; they have necks of Iron, and brows of Brass; though they are
persuaded, yet they are unperswadable. They will not hearken to the voice of
the Charmer, charm he never so wisely. They say to God as those wicked in Job
21. 14. Depart from us, for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways; their
ignorance is a spontaneous willing ignorance, (2. Pet. 3. 5.) they might know,
but they will not. Like those rebellious Jews, when God commanded them to walk
in his paths, they peremptorily answer, we will not walk in them, Ier, 6. 16.
and 44. 16, 17. let favor be showed to the wicked, yet he will not learn
righteousness: in a land of uprightness they will do unjustly, and will not
behold the Majesty of the Lord: yea though his hand be lifted up (in judgment)
yet they will not see. See Fenners Wilful Impenitency.
Here are four will-nots that aggravate their sin, Isa. 26. 10, 11. Let
strangers devour their strength, and gray hairs (the symptoms of feebleness,
old age and death approaching) be upon them, yet so stupid are they, that they
perceive it not. Hos. 7. 9. let God be a tender Nurse to lead and love them,
yet so sottish are they that they neither know nor acknowledgeit, Hos. 11. 1,
3, 4. Zeph. 3. 7. See the danger of Obstinacy in A^tersoll on Nu^b. p. 622.
etc. foli^.
These are wedded to their lusts and there is no parting of them, Hos. 4. 14,
17.

Observation 6.
To persevere in wickedness is the height of wickedness None so wicked as the
resolvedly wicked. They will walk on in darkness and that continually, it is
their Trade and they will not leave it. The best may fall through weakness, but
these are wilful. As resolution and perseverance in goodness is the height of
goodness, as we see in Job, (Chap. 2. 3.) who kept his integrity in despite of
all that Devil could do; and Noah (though he lived in a corrupt age, yet) in
despite of them all he sets his heart on God, and resolvedly walked with him all
his days, Genesis 6. 9. and Hez^kiah when he came to die, comforts himself with
this, Remember O Lord, how I walked before thee (continually or without ceasing,
so it is in the fountain) with an upright heart, Isa. 38. 3. so perseverance in
wickedness is the hight of wickedness, 2 Chronicles. 28. 22.

Observation 7.
Wicked men lead miserable lives. They walk in darkness: we pity such
Prisoners as lie and live in deep, dark dungeons all their days: why this is
the state of every wicked man, though they think themselves the only wise men,
and that none see but themselves, (as the Pharisees did, John 7. 49. and 9 ult)
yet there is no Prisoner that lies in the darkest dungeon especially (if he be
godly) but is in a better condition then the greatest wicked man that is
spiritually blind, though he live in pompous Palaces. These Rulers in the Text,
no doubt but they thought themselves very wise men (and probably they were so
in respect of natural and worldy accomplishments) yet because they abused their
parts, and did not improve them for Gods glory, he tell us here, They walk in
darkness. The Princes of Zoan are called fools, i. e. Pharaohs Counselors,
(which were worldly wise men) yet for want of saving knowledge are called fools
in Gods Dictionary, Isa. 19. 11.

This will yet better appear if we consider the allusions between inward and
outward darkness. 1. Darkness hinders us from seeing our way. A man tha^ walks
in darkness knows not whether he goes, (John 12. 35.) he may go into Ditches,
Boggs, Rivers, and miscarry many ways. So he that walks in spiritual darkness,
knows not which way to go, nor what to do: he is in perpetual danger of falling
into this ditch of error, and that bogg of Heresy, and to plung himself into a
world of sin and sorrow. Blind men cannot judge of colors, nor can these
distinguish between truth and falsehood.

2. Such catch many falls* and stumble at every thing: so when men's ways are
dark and slippery they are apt to fall every way into Satan's snares, ( Job 5.
14. and 12. 17. 25.) and to stumble and take offense even at Christ himself.

3. Darkness is a dismal thing, it fills men with fear and horror, ( Genesis 15.
12.) So that a man has no joy of himself, nor of the creature: so a man that
lies in spiritual darkness being destitute of saving knowledge, when conscience
is awakened, he is filled horror and Desperation, which imbitters all creature
comforts to him. Let us therefore labor for saving knowledge, and above all
getting, get true Understanding. Solomon prefers it before Silver, Gold and
Pearls, ( Prove. 2. 2, 3, 4.) because it brings grace, life and salvation with
it. Multiplicity of this knowledge will multiply grace, 2 Pet. 1. 2. This will
be a light unto our feet, and a Lamp to our paths. See the Excellency of Light.
Culverwell Light of Nature. Chap. 17. p. 173, 175, etc.
This Light is a pleasant thing, by it we see whence we came, whither we go,
how to order our steps, what dangers to shun, what enemies lie in our way that
we may resist them. Such are wise whose eyes are in their heads, but it is the
fool that walks on in darkness; (Eccles. 2. 14.) q. d. a wise man is well
advised and goes prudently to work; but a foolish man is imprudent and
unadvised in all his ways.

Observation 8.
Justice and Judgment are the foundations of a land, Psalm. 11. 6. A house may
as soon stand without a foundation as a Commonwealth without Government. When
the righteous are encouraged, and the wicked, punished, this upholds a Throne,
and establishes a Land, Prove. 16. 12. and 29. 4. Good Laws are the foundation
of a Nation; but the iniquity of Judges moves these foundations out of place,
and makes the state like a bowing wall that belcheth out, or a tottering fence,
Psalm. 62. 3. Isa. 30. 13. It Was therefore a notable piece of policy in Absalom
when he would steal away the hearts of the people from David, he went about to
persuade them that the King his Father had no Justice for them: but Oh that he
were made judge in the Land that every one that had any cause might come to him
and he would do them justice, 2. Sam. 15. 3, 4.

Let us therefore pray for those in authority that God would give them wise and
understanding hearts to know their duty, and knowing it to practice it, that
under them we may lead Pious, Peacable and honest lives: for if these
foundations once fail, and we have either no Magistrate, or corrupt ones, all
will run into confusion. When once wickedness comes to be established by a Law,
the sin becomes National, and National sins bring National Judgments: and
therefore you may observe in Scripture, and in all Histories, that when the
Rulers of a people have been wicked, ruin suddenly followed, Isa. 1. 23. 24.
Ier. 5. 28. 29. Micah 3. 11, 12. What potent and flourishing Nations have been
laid in the dust by Popish, Tyrannical, cruel Governors!

Observation 9.
Wicked men are stupid men. Let foundations be moved, and all things run into
confusion by their means, yet they are senseless, sit still and take their
ease, never regarding the afflictions of Gods people. Hester. 3. Ult. Let all
move, yet they will not move. Let the Lord bind them and beat them, yet they
cry not, Job 36. 13. though they lie amidst a Sea of troubles, and themselves
be as one that is on the top of Mast, yet there can they sleep fearlesly in the
midst of the greatest dangers: though they be stricken yet they stir no^, so
great is their Lethargy, Prove. 23. 35, 36. Pharaoh had plague upon plague, yet
nothing mended him, but he was Pharaoh still. Hence wicked men are called
brutish, Ier. 10. 21. and De^d, lay all the world on a dead man and he feels it
not. Rob them, ransack them, and let the fire of Gods displeasure seize on
them, yet they lay it not to heart, Isa. 42. 24, 25. It Is only good men that are
tender, sensible men and mourn for the afflions of Joseph.

VERSE 6, 7.
I have said ye are Gods, and all of you are Children of the Most High.
But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the Princes.
THese words are a kind of Prolepsis, where the Lord meets with the Pride of
Rulers who are puffed up with a high conceit of themselves, because these are by
place exalted above others. We (say they) are styled Gods, yea God himself has
styled ^s so, His Verbis usus est, non (...), aut ^antum (...) and concessive,
sed magis, (...) and reprehensive; ut potentiorum auth^^itate sud
abutentiuminiquitatem ^^plius ostenderet, ^vinceretque Dei ipsius verbis.
Juni^^ Parallel. 17.
and has made us Deputies immediately under himself. To this the Spirit of God
answers, 1* By way of a reprehensory Concession: It is true, I have said ye are
Gods, and I have appointed you for my Vicars and Deputies on earth to judge for
me amongst men, and to keep my people in Peace; but you have abused your power,
and ungratefully sinned against the God of your mercies, who has exalted you
from amongst your Brethren to Rule for him. 2. By way of Correction: yet I must
tell you, you shall die like other men and come to judgment, and therefore you
have little reason to be proud of that power which is delegated to you; Or,
here is, 1. Their Dignity and Majesty by reason of the eminency of their
Office, ye are Gods. 2. Their Frailty and Mortality, common to them with other
Sons of Adam in respect of their humane condition, ye shall die lik^ men; Or,
if you please, Here is 1. The Root of their unrighteous and exorbitant
Practices, viz. the pride that reigned in them by reason of that Dignity which
God had honored them withal, in communicating his own name unto them, and
calling them his ^ons. 2. Here is the Remedy, drawn from the consideration of
their dying and fading condition. 1. They must die like other ordinary men. 2.
They must fall from their dignity to the dust, as other great ones had done
before them. So that in the words we have the Excellency of Magistracy set
forth by two Titles, 1. They are Gods. 2. Sons of the Most High.


1. They are Gods, Non Par^icipatione divinae ^ss^ntiae, sed similitudine
di^^nae poten^iae. Non nat^ra, sed condition and dignitate muneris. Muis in
locum.
not by Nature (for we see they Die) but by similitude and in respect of their
Office, because they represent Gods Majesty in Governing of men, and have a
special character of his glory stamped upon them. But of this see more at large
on Verse 1.

2. Children of the Most High, or Sons of the most high God. This Title is
homonymous and has many significations in Scripture. Gnelion, filii excelsi,
viz. Dei, qu^a Deus est excelsus super om^^m terram, and vald e exaltatus super
omnes Deos.
1. It is sometimes taken for the Natural Son of God, and in this sense Christ
is the only natural and proper Son of God, John 1. 14. and 5. 18. Mat. 3. 17.
Romans 8. 32.

2. For the Sons of God by Creation. So God is called the Father of Angels, Job
1. 6. and 38. 7. Cant. 2. 3. and of wicked men, Mal. 2. 10.

3. Others are called his Sons by Adoption: thus all true believers are the
Sons of God. John 1. 12. Romans 8. 14. 16. Gal. 4. 5. 1. John 3. 2.

4. Others are called the Sons of God in respect of that Power, Majesty,
Authority and Eminency which God has conferred upon them above the ordinary
sort of men: and in this respect it is that Magistrates are called the Sons of
God; for as Parents give some part of their Inheritance to their children: so
the Almighty has invested Magistrates with part of his power and Sovereignty,
and entrusted them with the administration of his Earthly Kingdoms, by the
exercise of Vindictive and Remunerative Justice.

Now some conceive that Magistrates are called the Sons of God, because they
are more dear to God, and more acceptable to him then other men; but that will
not hold; for in this very Psalm where he calls them Gods, yet he sharply
reproves them for their unrighteous practices; and if Rulers be wicked, they
bring more dishonor to God, and do more mischief then inferior persons can
do, and so their persons are more displeasing to God then inferior persons
are; and God looks upon them as Beasts rather then men, Prove. 28. 15. But if
Magistrates be truly Godly, then they are the Sons of God in a double sense. 1.
As Believers. 2. As Magistrates; and so they are nearer and dearer to God then
ordinary men: they are as the Signet on his right hand, ever in his eye; he
looks upon them as his ornaments; Quaerit abs te ^rnari Diaabolus, as Austin
said of a learned man.
as the Devil uses all means to get men of Power and Parts on his side, that
he may the better advance his Kingdom; so God delights in gracious Magistrates
as the Pillars and Upholders of his Kingdom in the world. The more of God
dwells in any, the more he loves them; If Magistrates who are Gods in name, do
resemble God indeed, in Wisdom, Justice, Purity, Clemency, etc. then are they
the children of the most High in a Spiritual sense, and God has a Paternal
care over such, even as Parents have over their obedient children.

2. This implies Participation, and tells us that Magistrates derive all their
power from God, as a son has his from his father; and therefore it is but
Equity that they should employ that power which they have received from His
goodness, to the praise of him that gave it.

3. Here is the Extent of this Dignity, it is not given only to Superior
Magistrates, but to Inferior ones also; Ye are All the children of the most
High; yea wicked ones when placed in authority, are called Gods and Sons of the
most High. Those in the Psalm were none of the best, yea they were almost as
bad as bad could be. Verse 2. 5. And yet it is said here, I have said ye (in
respect of your office) are Gods, and children of God.

4. Here is their Commission; Ego dixi, est vox po^estatis ^^nstituentis.
I have said, It is not your that can make your selves Magistrates, but it is I
that say ye are Gods; all the power that ye have, it is from me; and therefore
our Savior expounding this of the Psalmist ( John 10. 34, 35, 36.) tells us,
that to Magistrates the Word of the Lord came, or was made. q. d. they have
their Command, Commission and Power from God to discharge the duties of their
places. When the Prophets were sent to preach, The Word of the Lord was said to
come to them. Luke 3. 2. The Word of God came to John, and then Verse 3. he
preaches and puts his Commission in execution: So when God has given
Magistrates a word of command, then, and not till then they may act with
comfort and with confidence. Our Savior in John 10. 34. refers us hither, when
the Pharisees reproacht him for blasphemy, because he made himself equal to
God, by saying, My Father and I are one, he clears himself from that aspersion,
by an Argument from the less to the greater, Thus; If the Title of God may be
given to Princes, who are but men, and many times the worst of men; then much
more may that Title be given to me, in whom the Majesty of God does more
especially appear, and the fullness of his Godhead dwell. The Antecedent I have
proved to you (says Christ) out of your Law which you cannot deny, and
therefore you must grant the consequent.

Verse 7. In this verse we have the Mortality of Magistrates asserted In two
words
1. Ye shall die. 2. Ye shall fall.


2. The Manner How; as other ordinary men, and as all other Princes have done
before you.

3. The certainty of this is confirmed by an Asseverative Particle, Verily or
certainly as ye live like Gods, so certainly ye shall die like men.

The words have some difficulty and Various Readings; I shall briefly explain
them, and then proceed to the Observations.

But ye shall die like men. Some read Surely or truly ye shall die; Achen,
certe, vere, prosecto, sane, est adverbium affirmandi. Pagnin, Montan^s, Calvin.
and this comes nearest the Original, for so the word (achen) is used in
Scripture; as Genesis 28. 16. Surely (achen) the Lord is in the place; so Isai.
40. 7. Surely the people is grass. And Isai. 53. 4. Surely he has born our
griefs. It is true, the Vulgar Latin that so often leaves the Fountain to follow
the Septuagint, do with them render it, But. But the most genuine signification
of the word is, Surely. The sense is good either way. But, i. e. for all your
pomp and power you must at last lie in the dust, and say to corruption, Thou
art my father, and to the worm, Thou art my Brother and Sister, Job 17. 14. or,
Surely, i. e. though you regard it not, nor make any provision for it, but
flatter your selves because you are Gods, and so dream that ye shall live on
earth for ever; yet know assuredly that ye are but men, and must die as well as
others. All Gods words are true and sure; but on some there is Affixed a
special note of certainty, because of man's (especially great men's)
extraordinary sottishness and infidelity.

Ye shall die like men.] Che Adam temutun, sicut Adam i. e. homo terrenus,
vilis, abjectus, Moriemini. Adam i. e. homo pleb^ius, opponituy (...) Ish, i e.
vero nobili, nt vid^re est, Psalm. 4. 3. and 49 2* and 62. 9.
That is, like other ordinary men; as ye came from the earth, so to earth you
must return. Death fears not you more then other men. Ish and Adam, the Noble
and Ignoble are alike to that grim Sergeant Death. Though men have lived like
Gods, yet they must die like Adam, or any other base, contemptible man; yea (if
wicked) ye shall die like beasts, for all your honor; (Psalm. 49. ult.) though
in respect of your Dignity you have been like Saul, taller by the head and
shoulders then the rest of the people, yet in your death there shall be no
difference; you must to the grave as other men, and then to judgment, for that
is included in the word Death. Heb. 9. 27. It is appointed for all men once to
die, and after death comes judgment.

And fall like one of the Princes. These words have many Glosses put upon them.
1. Some understand them of a fall by a Natural death. q. d. Ye Rulers of the
people for all your state and pomp, shall fall by death like others of your
rank, that have been before you, that were as high in honor and great in power
as your selves, and yet they dyed, Alioyum funera sint vobis specula, in quibus
vestra, citius fortasse quam putatis, affutura spectetis. Mendoza.
and so must you. Their graves amongst you, read a Lecture of Mortality to you;
they are gone off the stage of the world, and you are come on; it is not long
but you also must die and make room for your successors; and thus the word fall
is put for dying in Scripture, Genesis 14. 10. Psalm. 91. 7.

2. Others take this fall to be by a Violent Death. He had before said they
should die as other men; but now he rises higher, and tells them of a more
especial Judgment which should befall them rather then others, and that is, ye
shall fall; how is that? Why for your Tyranny and abuse of your power against
God and his people, Non tantum minatur Deus ipsos morituros, sed it a
morituros, ut et^am casuri sint de sedibus snis. Scultetus.
ye shall be cast out of your Seats; your pride shall have a fall, and that by
a Violent Death; for so I find the word fall taken very frequently in
Scripture, for Perishing by a Violent death; as falling by the sword, Exodus 32.
28. Hos. 5. 5. and 7. 7. or by the Pestilence, 1 Chronicles. 21. 14. 1 Cor. 10. 8.
Tyrants seldom go to their graves in Peace. Most of the Caesar's fell by the
hands of the people; q. d. If you be like Notanter dicit Hassarim, illorum
Principum. Muscul. Sar est Princeps, and Sarim Principes, Jer. 4. 9. and 17. 25.
Tyrants in sin, expect to be like them in Punishment; as I cast them out of
their Thrones for their Insolence and Violence; Sicut unus Principum i. e.
Profanarum gentium. Synech. Genesis Piscat.
so will I cast you out, and you shall fall like one of these Tyrannical
Princes.

3. Others take it for the falling as the Princes of other Nations; Ye shall
fall like one of the Tyrants. Tyndal.
q d. though you are the Princes of Gods people, yet are you not thereby
Privileged from the Arrest of death: for the most gracious Saint dies as well
as the most notorious sinner. Grace is an Antidote against the poison of death,
but not a Preservative against undergoing death.

4. Others take it for a falling from an high and flourishing condition, De
summo gradu ad imum, de magna gloria ad extremam miseriam praecipitabimini.
Bellarmin.
so as they shall be had in contempt of all. This is a truth, and the word fall
is often so used in Scripture. Isai. 3. 8. Psalm. 118. 13. Ier. 51. 8. But this
sense is too strait for this place. The Exegesis implies a greater falling then
from their estates.

5. Other learned men render the words thus, And ye shall fall like others, or
ye shall fall like one of the Vulgar. Unus quemlibet e vulg^ significat.
Calvin. Some there are that follow him against the Letter of the Text, which
runs thus, Sicut unus Principum cadetis: It is not sicut Unus Vulgi, vel e
Vulgo. I honor that eminent Instrument of God, but the Text and Truth I must
honor above all.
But this Version will not hold, and that for two Reasons. 1. It has no
foundation in the Original, nor in the Septuagint, nor in any of the Oriental
Versions. 2. It is a pure Tautology; ye shall die like Adam, i. e. like
ordinary men, and shall fall like one of the Vulgar, i. e. like ordinary men.
The three first senses are most genuine, as agreeing best with the Original,
the sense of the Text, and the like Scripture phrase. The sum and substance of
all is this, The Metaphrase.
q. d. It is true, I have said, and I say so still, that ye are by office,
Gods; and by Commission ye are all the sons of the most high God, whom he has
entrusted with some part of his Judiciary power; but yet this does not exempt
you from Mortality; for though in Dignity you are above others, yet Death will
level you, and you must to the grave as well as others who are ordinary men,
and as others of your own rank have have done before you: and then you who have
Judged others, shall be judged with others; for after death comes judgment.

Observation 1.
The Scriptures of the Old Testament are the Word of God. Christ cites this
very Text in the New Testament, ( John 10. 34, 35.) against the calumniating
Pharisees; yea Christ and his Apostles (to show the divine authority of the Old
Testament even in Gospel times) did fetch Arguments ofttimes out of the Old
Testament to confirm their Doctrine and practice. About 400 places are cited
out of the Old Testament in the New. See my Commentary on 2 Timothy 3. 15. p. 262.
But of this I have spoken elsewhere at large.

Observation 2.
Magistrates have their power and commission from God. It is he that said, and
it is his Word that comes to them which makes them Gods on earth. Magistracy is
no fancy of man's inventing, nor plant of his planting, for then it had long
since been rooted up by those sons of Be^ial that have so often opposed it, yet
could never prevail against it. If God had not been in this Bush (so often set on
fire) it had been consumed long ere this; it could never have stood so many
thousand years against the rage and fury of men and Devils. We may use the same
Argument to prove the Divinity of Magistracy, which sometimes we do to prove
the Divinity of the Scriptures, viz. the strange preservation of it in all
revolutions and changes, amidst those wars and confusions which have been in
the world. Some indeed have thrown off their Governors, but never yet could
throw off a Government. As soon as one is off, another is in the saddle; yea so
connatural it is to the Principles and notions of man's mind, that a Government
is found even amongst Heathens, where no Scripture is found to teach it. But of
this see more on Verse 1.

Observation 3.
It is lawful to give Titles of honor even to wicked Magistrates. Those in
this Psalm were none of the best, yea (all things considered) they were as vile
as the vilest; yet you see the Holy Ghost gives them their Titles of honor
still, I have said ye are Gods: and as if that were not sufficient, he
presently adds, and ye are All, mark that, not good Magistrates only, but also
the bad, even All (in respect of their place and office) are the children of
the most High; which may for ever silence those sots, which say, we may give
Titles of honor to Godly Magistates, but not to the Ungodly. But of this see
more Verse 1.

Observation 4.
Even wicked Magistrates have their power from God. Romans 13. 1. All power is
from God qua efficiens, and Unjust Power qua non impediens. Distinguendum est
inter potestatem in se, and Potestate^^ in subiecto. Po^est as in se est a Deo
instiluta, sed non semper in subjecto est just ^ and leg^tima propter
Usarpationem and abusum, River.
All power is of God; and yet the Rulers at that time were Heathenish
Persecutors. It is true, the abuse of the power is not from God, but the Power
it self is; as the abuse of the Ministry and marriage are not of God, though
the Ministry and marriage it self be. Be the Magistrates superior or
inferior, wise men or fools, good or bad, there is no power but it is of God.
The Apostle speaks not Indefinitly, The higher powers are of God, but he speaks
Universally and Exclusively, there is no power, be it what it will, but is of
God. Though the manner of getting into power by fraud and force may be
unlawful, and of man; yet the power and office it self is of God; and that not
only by permission (for so is sin and the Devils power) but by special
ordination; Emphasi non ca^et cum non dicit, Omnis potestas est a Deo, sed Non
est potestas nisi a Deo. q. d. nulla uspiam possit inter homines esse potestas
quae sit aliunde quam a Deo. 2. Non simpliciter dicit A Deo sunt, sed Ordinatae
sunt a Deo; alia est eorum condi^io quae permittuntur, alia eorum quae
ordinantur ac disponuntur, Musculus in Romans 13. 1, 2.
The Powers that be are ordained of God* Solent plerique nimis scrupulose
inquirere quo quisque jure adeptus sit imperium; sed hoc solo contentos esse
decet, quod videmus eos praesidere. Calvin. in 1 Pet. 2. 13.
for the greater manifestation of his Wisdom, Power, Justice and Goodness. We
must therefore show all due respect and reverence to Magistrates as
Magistrates* be they never so Vile; for though in respect of their wickedness
their persons may deserve contempt, yet their calling is Honorable. There is a
ray and sparkle of Gods Sovereignty and Image in Authority; and in that respect
(whatever the persons are) they must be Honored. We should not be too
scrupulous in enquiring how men come to their power, but rather study how we
may walk wisely, winningly, and Religiously toward such as are in power.

Observation 5.
God is the most High. He is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, the most High
over all the earth, and to be exalted above all Gods. ( Psalm. 86. 8. and 96. 4.
and 113. 4. This Title of most High is often given to God ( Genesis 14. 18, 22.
Psalm. 7. 17. and 46. 4. Luke 1. 32, 35. and 6. 35. and 8. 28. Acts 16. 17. Heb.
7. 1.) and is one of those V. D. Gouge his Arrows, p. 317.
ten Names which are attributed to God, Ad denotandam summam Dei gloriam,
potentiam and Majestatem, Deus dicitur altissimus.
to set forth his transcendent and surpassing Excellency, Majesty, Power and
Authority over and above all. Though others be High, yet there is an Higher
then they ( Eccles. 5. 8.) even the High and lofty one, who dwells in the
high and holy place, and judges those that are high, Job 21. 22. Psalm. 113. 5.
Isa. 33. 5. No Towers, See more in Mr. Gatakers Ser. on Psalm, 82, 7. p. 98, 99,
100.
Pillars, Places or Persons so high, but he can bring them down. It is this
most High that rules the Kingdoms of men, and gives them to whom he pleases.
Dan. 4. 32. and 5. 18. He is the great Jehovah, the Lord Paramount of Heaven
and Earth, there is none to be compared to him, Psalm. 135. 15. I know that the
Lord is great, and our Lord is above all Gods; whether they be so Deputed as
Magistrates, or Reputed as Idols. He is not only great, but Greatness it self;
not only high, but the most High, beyond the Tongues expression, or the hearts
imagination. It is infinite and so unspeakable; we may as soon measure the Sea
with a spoon, or put it in a bushel, as comprehend with our shallow
understandings his excellent Greatness; it is therefore called Unsearchable,
Psalm. 145. 3. Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised, his Greatness is
Unsearchable. All the power, perfection, beauty and excellency that is
dispersed through the whole world, that and ten thousand times more is in the
Lord by way of Eminency and Transcendency. All the glory that is in Angels,
men, and all creatures, compared to his, is but as a drop to the Sea, a shadow
to the Substance, or one little sand to a great Mountain; Heaven, Earth and Sea
compared to him are parum nihil, mere Nothing. In Isa. 40. 12, 15, 16, 17. we
have a most lively expression of the power of God, Who has measured the water
in the hollow of of his hand, and meeted out the Heavens with a span, and
comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the Mountains in
scales, and the Hills in a balance, etc. He does these great things with ease,
as if it were but Spanning, Measuring, Weighing, etc. Hence it is that
Greatness is truly and properly ascribed to God alone. Nihil magnum nisi Deus
magnus.
He only is great, Deuteronomy. 32. 3. 2 Samuel 7. 22. Psalm. 96. 4. and 99. 2, 3. and
145. 3. Titus 2. 13. Excellent is that Doxology of David, 1 Chronicles. 29. 11, 12.
Thine O Lord is the Greatness, and the Power, and the Glory, and the Victory,
and the Majesty; for all that is in Heaven and Earth, is thine; thine is the
Kingdom O Lord, and thou art exalted above all; both riches and honor come of
thee, etc. He is mighty in power; there is no opposing him, Psalm. 147. 5.
mighty in counsel; there is no out-witting him, Ier. 32. 13. mighty in working;
there is no out-doing him, Deuteronomy. 32. 4. and great in judgment; Exodus 7. 4.
there is no withstanding him, Exodus 7. 4.

1. Then Trust in this Great God; what though thou have great enemies, great
Tentations within and without? yet remember thou have the great God to assist
thee. A weak creature when backed by a stronger, will venture on a stronger then
it self. When the Prophet Micaiah saw two Kings sitting on their Thrones, he
was not afraid, because he saw a greater then they. 1 Kings 22. 10, 19. Moses
by an eye of faith beheld him who was invisible, and therefore did not fear the
wrath of the King, In ^e stas and non stas. Aug.
Heb. 11. 27. Did we stand by our own strength, we might well fear; but our
help stands in the Name of the Lord, Psalm. 124. ult. This upheld Abraham in
his straits; he doubted not, because God who had promised was able to perform,
Romans 4. 18. and this upheld Paul; I know whom I have believed, and that he is
faithful and able to keep what I have committed to him, 2 Timothy 1. 12. Get an
holy Magnanimity of Spirit; God loves to do great things for those that greatly
trust in him, as we see in those three Worthies, who were Giants rather then
children, Animo magno nihil est magnum.
Dan. 3. Oppose this mighty God to all the might that comes against thee.
Whilst others boast of their friends, Navies; Confederates, Strongholds, etc.
do thou make thy boast of God, and say, The Lord is my Light, and my salvation;
whom should I fear? there is none amongst the Gods to be compared to him, Psalm.
27. 1, 2, 3, and 86. 8. When Charles the fifth in a challenge to the King of
France, commanded his Herald to proclaim all his Titles, Charles Emperor of
such a place, King of such a place, Duke of such a place, and^. bids defiance
to the King of France. The King of France on the other side bids his Herald
proclaim no more but this, The King of France, the King of France, the King of
France, bids defiance to Charles the Emperor of Germany: Intimating that one
Kingdom of France was of more worth then all those empty Titles of the
Emperor. So when men cry Riches, Pleasures, Friends, Promotion, etc. Do thou
^ry, The Lord most High is my Portion, (...)
The Lord is my Portion; he that has him has all, he has the Fountain, the
Mine, the Ocean, and he cannot want, Psalm. 23. 1. Get therefore propriety and
interest in him; for what comfort is it to hear of so high and great a God, if
he be not ours? That word My is a little word, but there is abundance of
Divinity and sweetness in it, when with Thomas we can truly say, My Lord, and
my God. Let us by faith hide our selves under the wings of this most High
Protector, and abide under the shadow of this Almighty Shaddai, and there sing
care and fear away, Psalm. 91. 1. In all our distresses let us cry unto God most
High, and he will hear and help us, Psalm. 57. 2.

2. In the Churches distr^sses let us comfort our selves in the most High God.
The Church whilst it is in this world meets with Mountains of opposition; but
the comfort is, they shall all become a plain before Gods Zeruba^^ls; Zach. 4.
7. The Churches enemies in their own conceits are as great Mountains
Unpassable, Unaccessible, they proudly overlook the people of God. But God
contemns these contemners of his people, ( Psalm. 2. 1. to 6. Isai. 8. 9, 10.)
and though they think themselves Mountains, and their flatterers call them so,
and Gods own people looking upon them through the Spectacles of Fear and
Unbelief, think them such; yet God here by way of contempt, asks them, Who
art thou? q. d. Thou look high and haughty like a Mountain, but thou shall
become a Molehill, a nothing before me and my people; I will overthrow those
Mountains in my wrath, (Job 9. 5.) I will but touch them and they shall vanish,
Psalm. 144. 5. Isai. 2. 11, 12, 14. and though my people be but as so many
despicable worms, yet I will make them to thresh Mountains, Isai. 41. 44. Let
us not then fear, nor be despondent; that God which has brought us over the
Mountains of Popery, and the Mountains of Prelacy, that God will in his due
time bring us over the Mountains of Heresy, Libertinism, and Independency, etc.

Objection.
But how can this be? we see no Visible means to effect this.

Answer.
God is a free agent; and though he has tied us to means, yet himself is tied
to none; he has promised to create deliverance for his people, (Isai. 4. 5.
and 65. 18.) now Creatio fit
1. Exnihilo. 2. In instanti. 3. Irresistibiliter.


1. When the Lord created the world, he made it out of no prae-existing matter;
So though we see no means how he should deliver his people, yet he being
Almighty, can without means, by weak means, yea, by contrary means deliver
them. 2. He can do it instantly, when the hearts of his people are prepared,
for Reformation and deliverance, the work shall be done suddenly, 2 Chronicles. 29,
ult. 3. It shall be done Irresisti^ly. The work of Reformation it is the Lords,
and it shall prosper in despite of all its enemies, Hag. 2. 4. It is of God,
and it shall stand, Acts 5. 38, 39. Let us therefore encourage our selves in
the Lord our God. What though Giants, Sons of Anak, the great Zanzummims, the
High and mighty of the earth rise against the Church! yet there is a Higher
then they, who will break them with a Rod of Iron; yea if the Nations, All
Na^ions should comr against it, yet all their power compared with Gods Power is
parum nihil, an empty nothing, as the Prophet excellently, Isai. 40 15. Behold
the Nations are counted of him as a drop that hangs on the side of a full
bucket, or that stays behind when the water is poured out, yet does not
diminish the measure: or like the small dust of the balance, which remains in
the balance when powder or beaten spice has been weighed in it, which is
easily blown away with a little puff of wind. All the men in the world compared
with this High and Holy One, are Vanity, lighter then Vanity, Nothing, yea less
then nothing, Psalm. 62. 20. Many are afraid of displeasing Great men; let the
Great ones of the world take heed of offending this Great God, or of injuring
his people; for God is not only Absolutely and Essentially great in himself,
but he is also Relative^^ and Declaratively so to his people. The great God
loves to show his greatness on their behalf. As his greatness, is superlative
to all other greatness, whether they be humane powers, or ^maginary Deities; So
of his Goodness he will extend it to the protection and preservation of his
people, and for the confusion of their enemies.

3. Admire the great condescension of this great God toward man. Though he be
the most High, yet he dwells in the lowest hearts, Isai. 57. 15. he has but
two Thrones, the highest Heavens, and the lowest heart. He over-looks the frame
of heaven and earth to look on such, (Isai. 66. 1, 2.) nor does he look upon
them with a bare look of Intuition, but with a look of approbation and delight.
Barely to look on man is a condescension, Psalm. 113. 6 He humbles himself to
behold the things on earth: But to take up his dwelling with man, that is no
less an act of mercy then of wonder.

4. Serve this Great God with fear and Reverence. The greater the person, the
greater must our fear be, M^l. 1. ult. We cannot worship him rightly, unless we
worship him Reverently, Psalm 2. 12. Heb. 12. 29. he looks to be greatly feared
in the Assemby of his Saints. We should always come with self-abhorrency into
his presence, out of a sense of Gods exceeding greatness, and our own exceeding
baseness, Job 42. 5, 6. Eccles. 5. 1, 2. And if the Angels stand before him
with Reverence covering their faces; and Moses quaked and feared exceedingly
when he was with God in the Mount, (Heb. 12. 21) yea and the very inanimate
creatures tremble before him, the Mountains melt, the Hills quake, and the
Rocks rend, (Nahum 1. 3. to 7.) with what soul-abasement ought we to come into
his presence who have so many ways provoked him?

5. Turn serv^nts to him; you cannot serve a better Master; The ^reater the
Prince, the more Noble the service. Prefer His service before all the Crowns
and Kingdoms of the world. Spend thy self and all thou have for his honor.
There is none gives better wages then he.

6. Admire and Adore him for his Excellent greatness. The Holy Ghost often calls
on us to this duty, Psalm. 95. 2, 3 and 96. 4. Praise must wait for him in Sion,
Tibi Dominc (...)
(Psalm. 65. 1.) or Praise is silent for thee. A silent admiration of his
greatness, and an humble confessing of our inability to express his praise, is
the greatest praise we can give him.

7. Bew^re of offeuding this High and Holy One. Better have all the world
against thee, then God against thee. He is the best friend, and the saddest
foe. As he is great, and grea^ly to be praised, so he is great, and greatly to
be feared. He is a consuming fire; There is no abiding when he is angry. The
Lord most High is Terrible, and it is dangerous provoking him, Psalm. 47. 2. and
78. 56.

Observation 6.
Magistrates are the Sons of the most High. If they are true believers, then
they are his Adopted Sons; but if wicked, yet in respect of their office they
are Nuncupative and Nominal Sons. Thus God is pleased to style them.

1. To mind them of their Duty to him. 2. To mind us of our Duty to them.
1. He calls them Sons, (...) Things exempli^ied ought to resemble their
Samplar according to the reality of the form. Aq^inas P. 1. Q 18. (...) 4.
to the end they might walk worthy of such a Father, by loving, fearing,
serving, and obeying him, (M* l. 1* 6) A son honors his Father, and a servant
his Master; but God is not only a Father and a Master, but he is a King, a
Creator, a Counselor, a Protector and Assister of Magistrates; and if one of
these Relations call for respect and love; what Reve^^nce and respect is due to
that God in whom all these Relations coucenter and meet? Let such then improve
the Power which they have received from God, See Reasons why Magistrates should
honor God m^^e then others, in Mr. Gatakers Ser. on Psalm. 82. 6. p. 76, 77.
unto his praise. Uphold his Worship, advance his Scepter, promote his
Interest, defend his people, pity h^s poor, do justice to all; if you thus
Honor God, who has honored and exalted ^ou; he will be a Father and a Friend
to you; he will be a Sun for Consolation, and a Shield for Protection; he will
be your God and Guide unto death.

2. Does God call you Sons? then woe them that call you Satan's, and Revile the
Rulers of Gods people. It becomes us to honor those whom God honors. This
shows what spirit leads the fifth Monarchy men, and their adherents, who have
so grossly, and that in Print, reviled the Rulers of Gods people.

Objection.
But they are wicked men.

Answer.
Be it so; yet if a wicked man be set in Power by God for the sins of a people,
even that wicked man must be honored for his place; but if a godly man rule,
he is to be honored for his person. Some kind of honor is due to a Magistrate
as a Magistrate and Gods Vicegerent; but all kind of honor and subjection is
due from all sorts of men to good Rulers.

3. As Magistrates are Sons by Office; so all believers are Sons by Adoption,
which is a choycer Privilege, John 1. 12. Gal. 3. 26. and 4. 5, 6. So that now
every true believer may say with David, The Lord is my Shepherd, yea the Lord
is my Father, and I shall not want, Psalm. 23. 2.

Thou art now sure of
1. Dilection. 2. Direction. 3. Correction. 4. Protection. 5. Provision.
1. All the children of God are sure of Dilection and love. Fathers have a
natural affection to their children, and love them with a Paternal love. How
tender was David over Absalom, Touch not the young man Absalom; and when dead,
how does he take on? Oh Absalom my son, my son, that I had dyed for thee O
Absalom my son! If David were thus tender over a rebellious Absalom, how tender
is God over his obedient children? and though thou have many Infirmities, yet
God will pity thee, and spare thee as a man that spares his son that serves
him, Psalm. 103. 13. Mal. 3. 16, 17.

2. Direction. Fathers will teach their children the way which they should go;
so will the Lord do his, Psalm. 25. 9. It is a part of the New Covenant, That
all believers shall be taught of God. In all their doubts his Spirit shall be
as a Voice behind them, saying, This is the way.

3. Correction. Fathers that love their children will correct them. God loves
his, and therefore he chastises them for their profit, Heb. 12. 10. Revel. 3.
19.

4. Protection. Fathers will defend their children, and God will defend his; He
is their shield and bu^kler, Psalm. 84. 11. Prove. 2. 7. In six troubles he will
be with them, and in the seventh he will not leave them, Job 5. 19, 20, 21, 22.

5. Provision. Fathers will provide for their children; and if earthly parents
who have but a drop of goodness, will give good things to their children; how
much more will God give his Spirit to them that ask it? the Lions natural, the
Lions Metaphorical may lack and suffer hunger; but such as fea^ the Lord shall
lack nothing that may be for their good. God has prepared an Inheritance for
them, Luke 12. 32. he has given them his Son, and with him he has given them
all things, Romans 8. 32.

Verse 7.
Observation 1.
Men in high places are apt to have high conceits of themselves. It is an hard
thing to be in Honor without Tumor and swelling thoughts. The Lord who knows
our frame better then we our selves, foresaw this; and therefore in the
precedent Verse having told them of their Dignity, in this Verse he tells them
of their mise^y and mortality; that they might not have the least ^ime to be
puffed up with Pride and high conceits of their high places, he presently adds an
Humbling and abasing But, But ye shall die; what is that? Why, Synecdochically
it includes all those miseries with are Antecedent to Death, as Sickness,
Weakness, Pains, Aches, Old age, and Death; and also Subsequent miseries after
death; then must great ones as well as others be brought to Judgment, stand at
Gods bar, and give an account as well as the poorest Son of Adam. Those that
now judge others, must shortly be judged themselves.

Observation 2.
Magistrates are mortal as well as others; or, those who live like Gods, yet
must die like men. The most Potent Emperor must take his leave of this life as
well as the poorest beggar. No Titles of honor, nor Places of honor can
Privilege men from the grave. Their divine constitution cannot free them from
their native condition; Princes and great men must fall, See Mr. Le^isy his
Ser. on that Text, p. 207, etc.
and that in Israe^* 2 Samuel 3. 38. The truth of this is seen by daily
experience. It is so decreed in the High Court of Heaven; the Statute is
Universal, and admits of no exception; It is appointed for men, for all men
(the indefinite is equivalent to an Universal) once to die, Heb. 9. 27. Mors
scep^ra (...) aequat. Horat.
Death is the great Leveller of all the world, it makel all equal. Irus and
Croesus, Dives and L^zarus, Princes and Peasants cannot be known asunder in the
grave. As at a game at Chess, Aequales omnes (...) and Imperatores and
Pauperes, aequaliter morimur. Hieron.
when it is ended, not only Pawns, but Kings, Queens, Knights, are tumbled into
the bag together, so when the race of this life is finished, Noble as well as
^gnoble are tumbled into their graves together: hence death is called the way
of all the earth, because all flesh on earth must go that way, Josh. 23. 14. It
is the greatest road in all the world, it is never without many Travelers of
all sorts, ranks and Degrees. The grave is the house appointed for all the
living, (Job 30. 23. Eccles. 88.) both the small and the great are there, even
Kings and Counselors. I^b. 3. 13, 14, 19. Death is Pambasileus, a truly
Catholic Universal King; it is not only Rex terrerum, the King of fears, but
Rex terrarum, an Ecumenical King, that spares no age, Sex, Nation or
condition. In G^lgotha are sc^lls of all sorts and sizes: hence it is that ^he
Prophet Isaiah must not only say, but Cry, so as all may hear (for most men are
deaf on this ear) that not only some, but all flesh is grass (Isa. 40. 6, 7.)
i. e. i^ is a feeble, empty, fading thing; it withers while we touch it, yea
and the glory of it, i. e. such as have more glory bestowed on them then
others, are but as fading flowers; The sithe of death knows no difference, but
mowes down both alike, Psalm. 102. 11. and 103. 15, 16. Job 14. 2. 1 Pet 1. 24.
Ia^es 1. 10. 11. It P^ss^th upon all men, (Romans 5. 12.) he does not say, Death
may pass, or shall pass, but it has passed over all men; for though it has
not ipso facto as yet slain all, yet death is as certain as if it were already
executed upon all.

2. All are sinners, even great men as well as Poor, and therefore all must
die; for sin brought death into the world, Romans 5. 12. and 6. 22, 23.

3. We are all made of fading Materials. As there is terra (...) ^erimus, terra
quam quae^^mus, and te^ra quam ge^^mus; So there (...) is (...) quae (...).
Great men dwell in hous^s of clay and their foundation is dust as well as
others, Job 4. 19. Genesis 3. 19 and 18. 27. We are Dust Originally and Finally;
even Kings that are Gods on earth, are but Gods of earth, or rather clods of
earth: hence the earth is called His by a special propriety, Psalm. 146. 4. man,
i. e. Princely men, (for of such he there speaks) returns unto his dust; he
does not say, they go to their Cities, Castles, Kingdoms, these are now
another; but he goes to his Tomb, to his D^st and Ashes, that is the proper
possession of Kings.

4. They are subject to the like or greater diseases, calamities and judgments
of poisoning, Nulla aconita bibuntur ^^ctilibus. Juven.
stabbing, stifeling, surfeiting, etc. then other men.

5. As inferior persons must die and so make way for the arising of others, so
also must Superiors. God has others to arise and succeed them in their
places, that his power and glory may be seen in them also. Hence Saul dies that
David may succeed him. Moses dies that Joshua may appear. Daniel dies, and then
Haggai and Zecheriah arise; and when John Baptist, died then Christ appeared.

6. None of those Prerogatives and Privileges which great men enjoy can
Privilege them from the Arrest of Death.

It Is not
1. Riches. 2. Strength. 3. Parts, Policy. 4. Dignity. 5. Friends. 6. Piety.
1. Their Riches cannot save them from the grave they avail not in the day of
wrath, Prove. 11. 4. Ez^k. 7. 19. Zeph. 1. ult. the rich man died as well
Lazarus, Luke 12. 20. and 16* 22.) those that spend their days in wealth, yet
in a moment go down to the grave Job. 21. 13. 32. Rich men are apt to sing a
Requiem to their souls, and dream of living here many years: this is called
folly, Luke 12. 19, 20. and is notably confuted, Psalm. 49. 6. to 20. Princes
that had gold, and filled their houses with silver, yet must to their graves,
as well as the poor, Job 3. 15. Death will not be bribed, we gave a notable
instance for this in the King of Tyrus who abounded with all Riches, Jewels,
Merchandise, and lived in Eden, the garden of God; he lived as twere in
Paradise, insomuch that in his own conceit he was a God for Power, Wisdom and
Majesty; but God made him quickly to know, that he was a weak man, and
therefore he cut him off by a violent death in his own City, Ez^k. 28. 2. to 14.

2. Not Strength. Sampson was strong, yet death was too strong for him.
Alexander and Caesar which conquered Kingdoms, yet could not conquer death.
Nero, Caligula, Domitian, Titus, etc. the Terrors of their Time, yet were all
conquered by the King of Terrors. Men of power have no power over death,
(Eccles. 8. 8.) the Captain, the mighty man, and the man of War, are all in the
grave, Isa. 3. 2, 3.

3. Parts, Policy, Learning, Wisdom cannot preserve any from the grave. Solom^n
the wisest of men is dead, and daily experience shows that wise men die as well
as fools, Psalm 49. 10. Eccles. 2. 16. the Judge, the Prudent, the Prophet, the
Consellor and the eloquent Orator, are all swept away by death, Isa. 3. 2, 3.
Death is Nomen indeclinabile, the greatest Clerks have not been able to decline
it.

4. No Dignity nor honor can stave off death. Herod in the midst of his Pomp
was smitten dead, and devoured by Vermin. Let a man be never so high in honor,
yet he must die and perish, See Instances for this in that elaborate Tract of
^oly Love by Fonseca, chap. 37.
Psalm. 49. ult. Job 21. 28. 32. such as are the staff and stay of a State, even
the Ancient and the Honorable, yet are taken away by death, Isa. 3. 2, 3.

5. Friends cannot save or shelter you from this Arrest, be they never so great
or good, in them is no help; they cannot help themselves, much less others,
Psalm. 146. 3.

6. Not Piety. If any thing in the world could save a man from the grave, it is
this: and yet we see Moses a Pious, Meek, Learned, Self-d^nying Servant of God,
dies, Deuteronomy. 34. 5. Moses the Servant of the Lord died. David a wise man and
excellent Musician, a valiant Soldier, a man after Gods own heart, and one
that fulfilled all his will, and yet after he had served the will of God in his
generation he fell asl^ep, Acts 13. 22. 36. the holy Proph^s do not live for
ever, Zach. 1. 5. but even the Righteous themselves do perish, ^ollitur mors,
non ne sit, sed ^e obsit.
Isa 57. 1. Christ does not free his from death, but from the (...) of de^^h;
that which is Poenal is taken away; he has made that which in it self is a
curse, to become a blessing, of a Poison he has made a Medicine; and of a
Punishment an advantage. So that what Agag spoke vauntingly, we may speak
truly, The bitterness of death is p^st, Hos. 13. 14.

Use.
1. Fear not great men when they are great Oppressors; for there is a greater
then they who will bring them to judgment; how often does the Lord blame his
people for fearing such as must die, and then all their fury cease! Isa. 51.
12, 13.

2. Trust not in them. Though they be never so great, yet they must die, and
then all thy projects perish. If a man might trust in any man, it is in
Princes, for they can do more for us then ordinary men; and yet we are expressly
forbidden trusting in them, Psalm. 146. 3, 4. Trust not in Princes, nor in the
Son of man in whom there is no help; his breath goes forth, he returns to
his earth, in that very day his thoughts perish. Where you may see, 1. They
cannot help you. 2. If they could, yet they must die, and then all their
projects and purposes for themselves or for thee, perish and come to naught:
and therefore trust not in them, nor in any of the Sons of men; for they are
Vain, yea Vanity, yea lighter then Vanity: Nothing, yea if it be possible, less
then Nothing, Psalm. 62. 9. If you will trust in any, trust in the Almighty, for
he never dies, (Psalm. 18. 16*) The Prophets they die, and our Fathers, do not
live for ever. I, but the God of the Prophets, and the God of our Fathers lives
for ever, Psalm. 90. 1. When Father and Mother forsake thee, he will take thee
up; when all thy friends are dead, yet he is an everliving and an ever-loving
friend, who will guide thee with his Counsel till he bring thee to glory.

3. This must teach great men who are in high places, often to think on death and
judgment. God no sooner tells us of their Majesty, but he p^esently adds their
Mortality, to keep them humble in the midst of all their creature comforts. The
sight of this deaths head will damp all carnal delights; and this Verse well
thought on would make us look with a mortified eye on all earthly enjoyments.
Mortality is a very fit Meditation for Magistrates. Francis Borgia a Spanish
Courtier having been at the Funeral of the Empress, and considering how little
a grave had devoured all earthly greatness, Totus mutatus est in melius; V.
(...)
He began to reform his life, and became another man: whereupon he told his
friends, Augustae mors mihi vitam attulir The death of the Empress has brought
me to life. A serious consideration of Death will take off the scales from our
eyes, and make us see the vanity of all earthly glory, how short and transitory
it is; and therefore when you find your hearts begin to be lifted up with the
gay feathers of Honor, Wit, Wealth, Beauty or any other fading excellency;
then cast your eyes upon the black feet of your mortality, and it will humble
you. It is said of Hoshea the King of Sam^ria, that he should vanish like a
bubble, the foam and froth of water, (Hos. 10. 7.) we know bubble; do soon
arise, and as soon vanish; and as one bubble arises after another till all are
gone, so it is here. How many Popes enjoyed not their Pomp a year! V Me^dozain
1. Reg. 4. (...) 22. s^ct. 3. and 1 Reg. 10. n^m 27. Annot. 6. (...). P. 135.
ubi plura.
Some were cut off at eleven months. Some are at ten, others at nine, eight,
seven, six, five, four, three, two, one month. Yea some enjoyed the Chair not
months but days. Leo the eleventh sat Pope but twenty seven days. Pius the
third twenty six days, another twenty three, another twenty, yea Pope Vrbana
the seventh was Pope but seven days, and Pope Steven the second but four
days. Oh the madness of these Popes, many of which gave their souls to the
Devil for fading, flying, lying Vanities! As Philip King of Macedon commanded
his Page every morning when he arose to cry, Philippe, momento te esse
mortalem. Remember O King thou art but a mortal man. So say I, Memento te esse
bullam. Remember O ye great ones of the world, that you are but bubbles, which
soon vanish. I have read of Saint Austin that when he was at Rome, Aug. Sermon.
48* al fr^tr^s in eremo.
and saw the rotten Carcass of Caesar in his Sepulcher, he brake forth into
this Pathetical exclamation, Where, O where is the famous body of Caesar? where
are his riches and delights? where are his Troops of Lords and Barons? where
are his numerous Armies, his Horses and his Hounds, his Ivory Bed, his Arras
Hangings, his Imperial Throne, his change of Rayments, his curious Hair, his
comely Face? Where, Oh where is He with all his Pomp, that was once the Terror
of the world? The Answer was, All these left him, when his Breath left him;
they left him Captive in the Grave, etc. Commendable therefore was the practice
of Maximilian the Emperor, who some years before his death, commanded his
Coffin to be carried about with him, that by the sight of it he might be put in
mind of his mortality, and of the account he must shortly give of the Empire,
Tu mortem ut nunquam timeas, s^mper cogita.
and might be quickened in the mean time to a more diligent discharge of his
duty. This will be a corrosive to sin, and a curb to keep you from exorbitant
courses. Great men many times are great Tyrants; they make their lusts their
Law, and as the Donatists conceited that they could not err (though few erred
more.) So there are State-Donatists that cry, Quod statuimus justum est, Quod
volumus sanctum ^st.
stat per ratione Voluntas. What ever they decree must pass for just, though it
be never so unjust These forget their last ends, Nihil sic revocat homines a
pecca^o sicut imminentis mortis cogitatio. Aug.
as Jerusalem did before her ruin, Lam. 1. 9. They remember not that they who
sit on the Bench now, must shortly come to the Bar.

2. Let it be a Spur to duty; our time is short, our work is great, our Reward
unspeakable, Be active for God, do much in a short time: serve not, nor seek
your selves, but serve God in your generation, as David did, Acts 13. 36. as
you have your Places, your Power, your Gifts, your Time and Talents from God,
so improve them all unto his praise. Live the life of the righteous, and you
shall die their deaths. Walk in their way, Non potest male mori qui been vixit.
Aug.
and you shall attain their end. Be Israelites indeed in whom there is no
reigning guile, and then when you come to die, you may comforably say with
Nehemiah and Hezekiah, Remember me O my God for good, and remember how I have
walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which
was good in thy sight, Isa. 38. 3. Make it your daily exercise to keep a
Conscience void of offense toward God and man, See the singular comfort of a
good conscience at Death and judgment in Dyke on Conscience, cap. 11. p. 190,
etc.
and then when you come to die, this will be your rejoicing, even the testimony
of your consciences, that in simplicity an godly sincerity you have had your
conversation in the world.

Observation 3.
Great men must certainly die as well as other ordinary men. But does any one
question this? it would seem so, and therefore the Lord who knows our hearts
better then we know our selves, has set a Verily on it. The Pomp, Prosperity,
Peace and Pleasures of great men do so blind and harden them, that they cannot
awhile to think on death, or if they do, it is only slightly and notionally;
they do not realize death and look on it as ready to arrest them; if they did,
they would lead other lives then ^ow they do. They are apt to put the evil day
far from their soul, and (...) it that they draw near to the fea^ of (...),
Amos 6. 3. They have made a (...) death and a bargain with hell* hence (...)
man, (...).
every man; not only some of In^eriour rank, but ^uperiors also; Col Adam,
every Son of A^am, and that not only in his low condition, but in the best and
most prosperous condi^ion, when in the height of his beauty and bravery, having
all creature comforts about him; yet even then he is but vain, yea Vanity, and
not only in some measure Vain, but altogether Vanity. Col Adam col hebel. (...).
Man at his best is the very Universe of Vanity; and to put this further out of
doubt, the Holy Ghost pu^s a double seal to it, one at the beginning of the
sentence, and another at the End. Verily lets it in, and Selah shuts it up.
Implying that it is no doubtful or probable thing, but a most certain truth.

Observation 4.
Death is a fall. It is so to all, they fall from the society of men to the
company of worms; at death we fall from every thing save God and godliness; our
good works will follow us to Heaven; the comfort of them will endure for ever,
Rev. 14. 13. 1 John 2. 17.

2. Yet some shall fall more stairs and stories then othe^s, as ^r^nces, Rulers
and the Grandees of the world. The higher your standing is whilst you live,
the lower ye ^all when ye die; and therefore when Abner was slain, it is said,
a Prince and a great man was f^llen in Israel, 2 Samuel 3. 38. 39. Such fall from
their richest Treasures, delightfullest Pleasures, stately Mansions, dear
Relations, yea from whatsoever is called the good of this world, Job 7. 7. Your
eyes shall no more see good; you must now bid farewell to all your creature
delights: as you brought nothing into the world, so you shall carry nothing out.

3. Some yet fall lower then others, as Tyrants and wicked men who fall from
earth to hell, Psalm. 9. 17. The wicked shall be turned into Hell, and all the
people that forget God: he casts down the mighty from their Seats in fury. Few
Tyrants but come to violent deaths, See more before on Verse 1. Ob^ervation ^.
and miserable ends, as we see in Zachariah, Shallum, Pekahiah, and Pekah, who
in a short time were cut off by violent deaths, Hos. 7. 7. and 10. If the
Rulers of God people will be like the Rulers of the world in Pride and
Oppression, they must expect to be like them in punishment, and to fall as
those Tyrannical Heathen Princes have done before them; for God is no respecter
of persons or privileges, but is the same in all ages to the same sinners.

VERSE 8.
Arise O God, judge thou the earth, for thou shall inherit all Nations.
IN the first Verse we had the Psalmists Preface; in this last Verse we have
his Petitory Conclusion. The Psalmist seeing the gross stupidity of the Judges
of those times, how no warnings would work upon them, no complaints stir them,
no sense of their mortality affect them: by a sudden Apostrophe he turns
himself to God, and betakes himself to his prayers. Arise O God, Judge thou the
earth. Before he spoke in the person of God to those Rulers; he leaves them now
as desperate and past cure, and betakes himself to God. Arise O God. Where we
have, 1. The Substance of his Suit or matter of his Prayer. viz. that God would
arise and judge the earth. Addit (...) a proprio (...). Moller.
2. A Reason drawn from the Dominion and Universal Sovereignty of God over all
the world. For thou inheritest all Nations.

Arise, q. d. (...).
hitherto O Lord, thou have sat still and concealed thy power, though Justice
has been turned into Wormwood, and Righteousness into Hemlock; now the^e^ore
arise O Lord, and take the the Thro^e, rel^eve the oppressed, right the
wrong^d, and set all things in order which have been so long in coufusion.
Kumah, surge i. e. ad (...).
Th^s word arise, by an Anthropopathy is given to God, when he exerts and puts
forth his power (which seemed to sleep and lie dormant for a time, suffering
his people to be afflicted, whilst the wicked flourish) in punishing the
wicked, and delivering his people out of trouble. So the word is used, Numb.
10. 35. Job 31. 14. Psalm. 44. 23, 24, and 59. 5. and 68. 1. and 76. 8, 9. Zach.
2. ult.

O God, Elohim, i. e. O thou Creator, Governor, Prince and Judge of all the
world (so much the word implies) O thou Absolute, Universal, Supreme and
Righteous Judge, do thou now arise and Judge these unrighteous Judges of the
world.

Judge thou the earth, i. e. M^ton. Subjecti.
the men of the earth. q. d. since Justice is perished from the earth, and men
are so corrupt and careless that they will not do Justice, V^ndica p^ooos ^u^us
terrae i^colas ab oppressione judicum. Piscator.
but abuse their power; do thou therefore O Lord take the power into thine own
hand, and excute Justice ^or the oppressed and the needy: For thou do inherit
or, thou do possess all Nations. q, d. All Nations of the world, and amongst
the rest these oppressed ones, Haereditare est dominium i^ gentes jure (...).
are thine by a true Right and Inheritance; it concerns thee therefore to take
notice of them, and to right them in their wrongs, and not to suffer
unrighteous Judges to oppress and slay them at their pleasure, Tinchal,
possidebis, haereditabis.
Psalm. 74. 21. Or, Thou shall inherit, or thou shall possess all Nations. q. d.
Thou* whether they will or no, Goiim saepe dicitur de gent^bus i^^pdelibus and
incred^l^^.
shall have power over Jews and Gentiles; for thou art Lord Paramount, and the
true Possessor of all Nations; they are all within thy Jurisdiction add
Dominio; and therefore seeing that office belongs to thee, ^^ke it into thine
own hand, and do Justice for thy people: Let no Tyrant take thy right and
authority from thee; for thou do, and for ever shall possess as thy proper
peculiar, all Nations whatsoever.

Question.
But how comes the world to be c^lled Gods Inheritance, when the Church of God
is frequently calle^ his Portion and his Inheritance? Deuteronomy. 32. 9. Psalm. 135.
4. Isai. 19. ult. Mal. 3. 17.

Answer.
The answer is ea^^e. 1. All the world is Gods Inheritance by right of Creation
and perpetual preservation. But his Church is his by right of Redemption and
peculiar appropriation to himself. Eccl^sia vo^atur haereditas Dei and
possessio e^us, quia De^ dulcis and grata est, sicut unicu^^* solet esse
d^^lc^s and ^ucund^ ^^reditas quam possidet. Ravanella.
It is his portion and peculiar Treasure above all people: he looks upon all
the world but as lumber, dross and refuse in comparison of his people, Psalm.
119. 119. They are his Jewels, his * Segullah, See more of the word (...) in
Mr. B^ll on the Covenant. p. 103.
his s^lect portion, and rich treasure which he values at the highest rate.

Some would make this Verse a Prophecy of the Kingdom of Christ, when all
Nations shall be subdued to him, and be given him for his Inheritance*
according to that Psalm. 2. 8. Heb. 1. 2. Rev. 11. 15. But the Prophet speaks
not here of Christ, or of the last Judgment, but of the General providence of
God, whereby he governs the Kingdoms of the world with the Scepter of
righteousness (Genesis 18. 25. Eccles. 3. 17.) defending the good, punishing the
bad; preserving Laws, public Peace, Justice and Order: and though he has
committed the custody of these to Magistrates who are his Deputies, yet he
himself is the chief Judge; and when they neglect their duty, then he appears.
The sum of all is this: O Lord, since the iniquity of ung^dly M^gistrates is so
exceeding great, not only amongst thy own people, but even through the whole
world; righteousness is fled, and justice cannot be found, the righteous are
debased, the Unrighteous exalted, the nocent are countenanced, and the innocent
condemned; the ri^h are favored, and the afflicted trod under foot: therefore
do thou Lord arise, bring down the proud, punish the nocent, set free the
innocent, rescue the poor and fatherless from the jaws of Tyrannic^l ones; that
all the earth may know that thou only art Lord and Supreme Judge of all the
world.

Observation 1.
God sometimes seems to sleep when his people are in trouble. He seems to be
careless, and let all run into confusion, as we have seen in this Psalm. Not
that God does indeed sleep or disregard the affictions of his people, for he
that keeps his Israel, does not so much as slumber, much less sleep, Psalm.
121. 4, 5. He has a special eye upon his people for good, he protects them so,
that the Sun shall not hurt them by day, ^or the Moon by night, i. e. no time,
no thing shall hurt them, neither Sun nor Moon, neither heat nor cold. 2. No
part of them shall be hurt, thy soul shall be preserved; thy going out and
coming in shall be guided and guarded: these include the whole person of man
with all his just undertakings and affairs. Thus are they kept who have the
Lord for their keeper; and as if this were not sufficient, he adds Verse 3. He
will not suffer thy foot to be moved, i. e. he will not suffer thee or thine to
be moved or violently cast down; the power of oppressors shall not prevail
over thee; for the power of God sustains thee. Lest any should hurt his
Vineyard, he keeps it night and day, i. e. at all times, Isai. 27. 3. So that
to speak properly, there is no passion in God, there is neither rest nor motion
in him, but the Scripture speaks of him by an Anthropopathy, according to our
apprehension. Thus the Lord is said sometimes to be slack, slow, and delay his
coming; and then by our Prayers we must quicken him, Psalm. 40. 17. Make no long
tarrying O my God, Psalm. 74. 1. How long Lord, how long will thou forget thy
people! Sometimes he seems to forget his Church, and then his people must put
him in remembrance, Isai. 62. 7. Ye that are the Lords remembrancers give him
no rest. Sometimes he seems to sleep, and then he expects that his people by
their prayers should awaken him, as in the Text, Arise Lord. The Lord is a God
of great patience, and long suffering; he bears long with the vessels of wrath
fitted for destruction, Romans 9. 22. He bears so long with the wicked till they
rage again, and insult, thinking that God approves of their wickedness, Psalm.
50. 21. He seemed to sleep at Isreal's troubles 430 years; but at last Pharach
and his followers paid for all together in the Sea. The Amorites one would
think had been wicked enough to have been destroyed, for they were gross
Idolaters, grand oppressors, and notorious for lust; yet God bare some hundred
of years with them, tell they were ripe for ruin, Genesis 15. 16. Woe then to all
the insulting, blasphemous enemies of Gods people, though God seem for a time
to sit still and sleep, letting the wicked oppress the righteous who is better
then he, (Hab. 1. 13.) Yet as a man after sleep is refresht; so God will arise
like a Giant refresht with wine, and then his enemies shall be scattered, and
those that hate him shall flee before him. As smoke is driven away by a mighty
wind, though it seem black and formidable at first; yet it soon vanishes; and
the higher it ascends, the sooner it is scattered; and as wax melts before
the fire, so shall the wicked perish at the presence of God, ( Psalm. 68. 1, 2.)
If the Lord do once arise, though his enemies be never so many or mighty, yet
they are soon scattered. Let the Lord but look upon the Host of the Egyptians
through the Pillar of fire, and it troubles and torments them, Exodus 14. 24.
Let not then Gods people be despondent, though the Lord make them wait, yea and
wait long; though the Vision be yet for an appointed time, yet at the end it
shall speak comfort to those that Patiently wait Gods appointed time; and to
assure you of this, the promise is doubled and trebled; It shall speak, it will
come, it will surely come, it shall not lie, it will not tarry, Hab. 2. 3.

Question.
But when will the Lord Arise for his people? the harv^st is past, and the
Summer is ended, and yet we are not saved?

Answer.
Though God seldom comes at our time; See Ten seasons wherein God will arise
for to help his people. Mr. Case his ^ast Sermon on Psalm. 68 1, 2. p. 21.
Preached 1644.
yet he never fails of his own time; in his due time he will arise and save his
people; only do not ^imit the Holy One of Israel to your time: for when he sees
it is most for his own glory, and his peoples good, he will certainly Arise. He
only waits for a fit time to be gracious, Isa. 30. 18. Yet for your better
satisfaction, know, That there are two seasons more especially wherein the Lord
loves appear to for his people. 1. When the enemy is most high, begins to
insult and blaspheme, crying, Where is now their God? he is asleep and cannot
save; then their fall is near, Job. 20 5. Psalm. 94. 2, 6. to 23. See more in my
Comment. on 2. Tim. 3. 9. p. 182.
Violent things last not long. 2. When Gods people are most low, and all seems
to make against them; when the enemy seems to carry all before him, and his
peoples strength is gone. Now, Now, Now will I arise says God, Isai. 33. 9,
10. Deuteronomy. 32. 36. Cum duplicantur lateres, venit Moses. God lets things come to
the Mount, and then he appears, Genesis 22. 14. When his people lie as dry, dead
bones, in an hopeless, helpless, fatherless, forlorn condition; then God loves
to appear for their help and succor, Ezekiel. 37. 11. Exodus 3. 9. Psalm. 12. 5. and
10. 12. and 102. 13. Hos. 14. 3.

Observation 2.
When Gods people are in distr^ss, they must awaken God by their Prayers. So
does the Psalmist here, Arise Lord and Judge the Earth. When they can have no
help on Earth, they must go to Heaven. When the Gods on earth will not right
us, R^stat i^er (...)
we must appeal to the God of heaven. It is matter of singular comfort, that
when Tyrants cruelly oppress us, and we can have no relief below, yet we have a
God to go to who will Vindicate our wrongs, and plead our cause against our
enemies: But then we must Awaken the Lord by fervent and importunate Prayer. He
seems to rest till he be disquieted by our Prayers. Though he will help us, yet
he will be sought of us to do it for us; hence his people so often cry, Arise
Lord and save thy people; and Awake, why sleep thou? Psalm. 3. 7. and 7. 6.
and 9. 19. and 17. 13. and 68. 1. Hab. 1. 2, 3. per totum.

Only remember it is not every kind of Prayer that will awaken God; but it must
be, 1. The Prayer of a right^oous man, such as Moses, Job, Samuel, Daniel; who
have both imputed and imparted righteousness. He must come in the raiment of
Christ his elder Brother; there is no seeing Gods face unle^s we bring him with
us. Christ only is the way; there is no coming to the Father but by him. It was
death under the Law for any man to offer a Sacrifice himself, though it were
never so good; it must be put into the Priests hand, and he must offer it:
Every Sacrifi^e must be seasoned with salt (Lev. 2. 13.) Christ is that true
salt which seasons both our persons and pe^formances, and makes them acceptable
to his Father. What ever we ask it must be in Christ's Name, and not in our own,
John 14. 13, 14. The person must please, before the Prayer can please. God had
first respect to Abel, and then to his offering. The man must be good, or his
Prayer will never be heard. God hears not sinners, i. e. Impenitent sinners
which make a Trade of sin, (Psalm. 66. 18. John 9. 31.) there is no standing
before God in our sins, Ezra 9. ult. And earthly Prince will not traffic with
rebels to his Crown and Dignity; to such God says, What have thou to do to
take my Name into thy mouth? Psalm. 50. 16, 17. the Prayers of a Prou^, profane
Libertine are an abomination to God, Prove. 15. 8. and 28. 9. he esteems them as
Swines blood, or the offering a Dogs neck in sacrifice, Isai. 66. 3. as the
howling of a Dog, Hos. 7. 14. or as lying and dissembling, Hos. 11. 12. The
wicked compass me with lies when they cry, My Father, my Father. And therefore
when ever we draw nigh to God in Prayer, we must wash our hearts and our hands
in innocence, lifting up pure hearts and pure ^ands. All that call on the Name
of the Lord must depart from iniquity, 2 Timothy 2. 19. If we be such as do his
Commandments, then whatsoever we ask we shall receive, 1 John 3. 22. Hence the
promises run to the righteous, Prove. 10. 24. The desire of the righteous shall
be granted. Psalm. 145. 19. He will fulfill the desires of them that fear him, 1
Pet. 3. 12. Prayer is not a work of the wit, voice, memory, but of the heart,
Psalm. 25. 1. Let the words be never so excellent, if they come not from the
heart, it is but lip-labor and lost labor, Isa. 29. 30. To pray against
Pride, Covetousness, Passion, Hypocrisy, etc. when the heart does not hate
those sins, nor will they part with them at any rate, but are angry with such
as would separate between them and their lusts, what is this but to mock God to
his face, and to give him occasion out of our own mouths to condemn us? If ever
we desire that God should hear our Prayers, we must first put iniquity far from
our Tabernacles, Job 22. 23, 27. Our Prayers must not come from feigned lips,
Psalm. 17. 1. God is nigh to all that call upon him; but then they must call
upon him in truth, Psalm. 145. 18. It is the Prayers of the Upright that are
Gods delights, Prove. 15. 8. And as all sin, so three especially there are that
mar men's Prayers. The first is Ignorance, when men have no sense of their own
misery, nor of the Majesty of that God they pray to: such cannot pray, Romans 10.
14. How shall they call on him of whom they have not heard? or if they do, yet
there prayers are abominable, Prove. 28. 9. 2. Pride, when men are full of
self-confidence, and think to be heard for their own merits and righteousness.
God resists such proud Pharisees; but it is the prayer of the destitute and the
humble which he regards, Psalm. 10. 17. and 102. 16, 17. 3. Oppression and
cruelty; the cry of these sins outcries their prayers so as they cannot be
heard. Though such should pray, yea and make many Prayers, yet God will not
hear, Isai. 1. 15. how can he expect mercy from God, who shows none to his
Brother? Prove. 22. 13. He that stops his ears at the cry of the poor, shall cry
himself, and shall not be heard.

The Question then will be. Whether a wicked man may pray?

Answ. The first Commandment of the Moral Law requiring Prayer, it obliges
Uinversally; besides, all men have need to pray always, in all things, even
for the continuance of being, because they depend on this Supreme being* Lawson.
Prayer considered as a Duty, binds all men; for though wicked men cannot pay
to God as to a Father, yet they may as to a Creator. Prayer is good in it self,
though by accident the wicked turn it into sin; now though for want of faith
such prayers cannot please God; yet being good for matter, giving glory to God
in sundry of his Attributes, they may procure temporal ^essings, or divert
(for a time at least) some temporal judgments. The cry and m^an of the
creature often move^h compassion in the Creator; he hears the cry of Ra^e^s and
feeds them: and when the Isra^lites cried, (though but hypo^ritically and in
their trouble) yet he delivered them out of their distress, Psalm 78. So Ahab
and the Ninivites.

2. The Prayer must be fervent; both these Qualifications we have in one verse,
James 5. 16 The eff^ctu^l ^ fervent Prayer of a rightecus man avail^th much. We
must awaken our selves and cry aloud, if ever we would awaken God. So did the
Prophets, Isa. 51. 9. Aw^k O arm of the Lord, awake, awake and put on strength.
There is no getting the blessing without striving; hence we are commanded to
strive in Prayer, Romans 15. 30. Luke 18. 4, 7. Romans 8. 26. Colos. 4* 2. It is
only weeping, wrestling Jacobs that become prevailing Isreal's, (Hos. 12. 4.) It
is this seed of Jacob that never seek Gods face in vain, Isai. 65. 9. We must
stir up our selves that we may lay hold on God, and use Argumentative Prayer as
Moses did, Exodus 32. 11, 12, 13. and get an holy (...), impude^ia, importun^tas.
* Impudence as that widow did, See Mr. Love on that Text.
* Luke 11. 8. God loves to see us fervent when it is for his own glory and his
Churches good. Haec vis grata Deo est. Tertul* lib. de orat.
Tell him the cause is his; had it been our own cause we had been silent, but
the cause is his; and the people that are oppressed are his, and the enemies are
his; they blaspheme his Name daily; it is their daily practice to vent
blasphemies against him and his Truth; and therefore beseech him to Arise. When
things be out of order in Church and State, Prayers and Tears are our best
weapons. It is not for private persons in such cases to rise tumultuously and
revile their Rulers, (this will but exasperate, and not heal our distresses)
God does not say here, O ye afflicted and wronged, Arise and slay your
unrighteous Rulers; No, but rather slay your sins, which provoke God to set
them over you; and by Prayer cry to him that he would Arise and help you. Thus
did the Primitive Christians in Tertullians time; So the people in S^uls time,
when the Lord told them how cruelly he would deal with them, he tells them what
they must do, (2 Samuel 8. 18.) ye shall cry in that day, because of your King.
They must not rise in rebellion against him, but they must cry unto God for
aid. We must spread our case and our cause before him who is the Judge of all
the world, and who has promised that the rod of the wicked shall not for ever
lie on the lot of the righteous, Psalm. 125. 3.

Caut. This is spoken against Private persons taking up arms, and not against
the inferior Magistrates defending Religion and the godly, when the Superior
is an enemy to both; o^ this Judgment was the learned B Bilson, V. Bilson his
Philander, Part 3. page 279* etc.
(a man free enough from Sedition or Faction) I will not rashly pronounce
(says he) all that resist to be Rebels; c^ses may f^ll out even in Christian
Kingdoms, where the people may plead their right against the Prince, and yet
not be charged with rebellion E. G. If a Prince go about to subject his Kingdom
to a forr^in Realm; or change the form of the Common-w^^lth from I^p^ry to
Tyranny; or neglect the Laws ^stablisht by common consent of Prince and People
to execu^e his own pleasure. In these and other cases which might (...) n^^ed,
If the Nobles and the Commens join togeth^r to defend their anci^nt and
accustomed Liberty, Regiment and Laws, they may not w^ll be accounted Reb^ls.
This and more you may see in the place quoted, which excellently clears the
justness of the late Parliament Wars. If any desire further satisfaction, he
may see 44 Questiors learnedly debated by Mr. Rutherford in his Lex Rex, V.
S^arpi^s C^rsus Theolog. Loc. de ^agist. Q. 2 p. 246. P. 2.
where he strongly asserts the Lawfulness of Defensive Wars, and takes off all
Cavils that are brought to the contrary. But what ever means be used, yet
Prayer may in no wise be neglected. It is it that blesses all means, obtains
all Grace, and brings comfort to us in all our distress. So that

A Prayerless man is a
Graceless man. Useless man. Cursed man. Comfortless man.
1. A Prayerless man is a Graceless man. Grace is obtained by Prayer; Ask and
have, Ezekiel 36. 37. A man of much Prayer is usually a man of much Grace, as we
see in Daniel, and David who was a man composed as it were of Prayer, Vaani
tephilla, Ego a^t^m oration. i. e. Vir orationis, and orationi deditus.
Psalm. 109. 4. But I Prayer, or I give my self to prayer, as being much in that
work, and making it his only fence and refuge. When Paul was converted, then he
Prays, ( Acts 9. 11.) No doubt but he being a strict Pharisee prayed before;
Ficta pro infectis sun^.
I but says the Lord, go to him now; for behold he prays, i. e. feeling^y,
fervently and effectually; and not coldly, cursorily, and formally as the
Pharisees did, which was no praying in Gods esteem. Hence the Spirit of Grace
and the Spirit of Supplication are joined together, Zach. 12. 10. and they are
branded for Irreligious Atheists, that call not upon God, Psalm. 14. 4. Let thy
outside be never so civil, or smooth, yet if thou be a Prayerless man,
certainly thou art a Graceless man.

2. An Useless man Unfit for any service of God, a burden to the place he lives
in; like Ieremiahs girdle, good for nothing, Ier. 13. 7. As a Praying Saint is
a public good, even the Chariots and the Horsemen of Israel; so a Prayerless
sot is a wen, a blemish and burden to the Church and State he lives in.

3. A c^rsed man. As food, rest, riches, labor, and all other things are
sanctified to us by Prayer; so on the contrary without prayer all is cursed;
you may rise early, and yet labor in vain, ( Psalm. 127. 1, 2.) and get riches,
but they will prove snares unto you.

4. A comfortless man. He has no God to make his moan to in his troubles; and
thence it is that wicked men though in prosperity they be very high, yet in
adversity none so despondent and amort as they.

But a man of Prayer is still the same; in all his distresses he has a God to
go to, he has hidden Mannah which the world knows not off. By this he gets
strength from God either to overcome the Tentaton, or to undergo it patiently;
it either removes the affliction, or else gets it sanctified. Prayer has
Virtutem pacativam, a settling and composing power; it stills the distempers of
the soul, as sleep composeth the distempers of the body. Christ by Prayer
overcame his agony, and cheerfully goes forth to meet even those that sought to
crucify him, Mat. 26. 44. 46. Hannah that before was in bitterness of spirit,
Egressa fuit e Tabernacul^ spei plena, and animo ad omnia perferenda alacri ac
prompto; qui orationis ^ructus fuit praecipuus. Sanctius in 1 Samuel
yet after she had been at prayer, her countenance was no more sad, 1 Samuel 1.
18. This made Luther call Prayer the Leeches of his cares, and Christ bids his
Pray that their joy may be full, John 16. 24. As Moses when he came from the
Mount, the people discerned that he had been with God; so a gracious soul never
comes from God but he carries away somewhat of God with him. Nunquam abs te
absque te rec^do. Bern.
Prayer is a Catholicon, it is a Panacea, an universal remedy for every malady;
if any be afflicted internally or externally, let him pray, James 5. 13. It is
a special and eminent part of Gods Worship, in which we draw nigh to God, and
he to us. By it we glorify him in all his Attributes, in his Truth, Wisdom,
Mercy, Omnipotence, Omniscience, Omnipresence, etc. Hence it is often put for the
who^e Worship of God Synecdochically, or Virtually containing much of Gods
Worship in it. So Mat. 21. 13. My House shall be c^ll^d the House of Prayer.
Do^us orationis i. e. divini cultus, cujus praecipua pars ^st ^ratio; a pr^c
bus en^m omn^s ^ul us in^ipiendus and conclud^^^^s Paraevs.
Not that Prayer should justle out other Ordinanc^s (as some would have had it)
but it is spoken by way of Eminency, because Prayer must accompany every
Ordinance. So often in Script^re calling on Gods name, is put for tht whole
Worship of God, Genesis 4. 26. Psalm. 50. 15. Romans 10. 12. This se^s all our Graces
on work, as Knowledge, Faith, Love, Patience. Th^s sets the Crown on Gods head;
as Ioab when he had taken R^bbah sent for David to take the glory of it: so
Prayer gives all the glory of what it has or does to God, and therefore it is
that God loves to do such great things for his praying people; hence their
Prayers are called Incense: there is no incense so pleasing to our smell, as
the Prayers of the faithful are to God, Psalm. 141. 2. and Swe^t od^urs, Rev.
5. 8. Insomuch that God even begs their Prayers, Cant. 2. 14. Let me hear thy
voice, for it is sweet. This is a special preservative, 1. Against sin: we live
in an in^ectious world, and we had need to Antidote our selves against sin by
Prayer before we go forth of our doors, Watching and Prayer is a special
preservative against the power of temptations, Mat. 26. 41. 2. It is a special
help against the c^ncomitants of sin. Many are the miseries that attend on sin,
as Sword, Plague, Famine: Prayer he^ps against them all, 1 Kings 8. 33. to 38.
The Psalmist tells us of Travelers, Seamen, Sick men and Captives that cried
to the Lord on their trouble, and he delivered them, Psalm. 107.

This is
1. A Sure Helper. 2. A Secret Helper. 3. A Speedy Helper. 4. A Strong Helper.
1. Prayer is a sure helper; a right qu^lified Prayer for Man, Matter, Manner,
never misseth; but ever obtains either the blessing prayed for, or some better
thing. God always answers his, ad Vtilitatem, si n^n ad V^luntatem. e. g.
David prays for the life of his child; God denies him in that thing, but gives
him a S^lomon, which was legitimate, and every way better for him. So Paul, he
prays for deliverance from the messenger of Satan; God suffers the trial to
abide, but gives him grace to improve it for good, which was better for him
then if it had been removed. Though God be the principal Actor, yet Prayer is
causa adjuvans, (2 Cor. 1. 11.) y^u also helping me with your pr^yers, q. d. if
you will but help me with your prayers, I doubt not of deliverance.

2. Its a secret helper. It secretly undetermines the plots, and reveals the
projects of wicked men, and they know not who does it. One while they curse
such a man, and anon they curse such counsel, and such instruments, when it is
the Prayers of Gods people that do them all the mischief. David's prayers turn
Achitophels policy into folly, 1 Samuel 15. 31.

3. A speedy helper, It brings sudden deliverance. Hester does but pray, and
suddenly Haman comes down. This pierces the Clouds and brings us present aid.
Nehemiah, (chap. 2. 4.) he darts a prayer to heaven, and has present help; God
gave him favor in the sight of the King.

4. It Is a strong helper. See how Prayer is an eightfold helper. In Mr. Green
his Fast Sermon on Nehemiah 1 3. p. 26, etc. Preached 1644.
Nothing like prayer for strength. As David said of Goliahs sword, there is
none like that. Luther was wont to say, Est quaedam precum omnipotentia; Prayer
has a kind of omnipotent power. Like the Sword of Saul and the Bow of Jonathan
which never returned empty from the battle, ( 2 Samuel 1. 22.) It binds God and
holds his hands that he cannot destroy a people; Feriendi licen^iam petit a
Mose qui fecit Mosen.
hence the Lord entreats Moses to let him alone, Exodus 32. 10. and when the
Lord would destroy a people, he forbids his servants praying for them, Ier. 7.
16. This commands the Commander of all things, (Isa. 45. 11.) it is stronger
then any charm, Labash, (...), ^roprie sign^fic^t (...), and p^ssim accipitur
p^o incantatione. Piscator.
(Isa. 26. 16.) in their trouble they poured out a prayer, or made a soft
muttering to thee; you need not go to charms in your troubles; prayer can do
that which they cannot do. It is stronger then Iron: at the Prayers of the
Church the Iron gates fly open, and Peter's fetters fall off, Acts 12. 5, 6. The
prayer of one Jacob is too strong for four hundred men that come against him,
Genesis 32. 6. 9. and 33. 4. One Moses in the Mount praying is too strong for all
the Armies in the Valley fighting. Iehosophat when surrounded with enemies, by
prayer overcomes them. By this Hezekiah overthrew the great Army of Senacherib.
By Prayer Asa with a few in comparison of those that came against him, overcame
an army of a thousand thousand men, and three hundred Charets, 2 Chronicles. 14. 9,
10, 11. By this Theodosius robustissimum exercitum m^g^s orando quam feriendo
vicit. Milites qui nobis aderant, retulerunt, extorta sibi esse de manibus
quaecunque jaculabantur, cum a Theodosii partibus in adversarios vehemens
ventus iret, and non solum quaecunque in eos jaculabantur concitatissime
raperet, verum etiam ipsorum tela in eorum corpo^a retorqueret. Unde
Claudianus, quamvis a Christi nomine alienus, in ejus tamen laud^bus dixi^; O
nimium dilecte Dco, cui militat ether,
Et conj^rati veniunt ad classica ven^i;
August. de Civit. Dei. lib. 5. cap. 26.

Theodosius overcame the potent Armies of his adversaries, and turned their
darts upon their own heads.

The Queen of Scotland affirmed that she did more fear the prayers of Mr.
Prayers are Christian^rum bombardae The Christians best Artillery. Luther.
Oration justi clavis caeli. Aug.
Knox and his Assistants then an Army of ten thousand men. There are five Keys
in the hand of God, and Prayer turns them all.

There is
1. The Key of the Heart. 2. The Key of the Womb. 3. The Key of the Grave. 4.
The Key of Heaven. 5. The Key of Hell.
1. There is the Key of the Heart, and Prayer turns this Key. Esau came against
Jacob with an intent to kill him, but God so changed his heart at the prayer of
Jacob, that he fell upon his neck and kissed him.

2. The Key of the Womb. Hannah that was barren, prayed, and the Lord gave her
a Sam^el; and Manoah prayed, and had a Sampson.

3. The Key of the Grave. Hezekiah prays and has his life prolonged. The
Prophet by Prayer raised the dead child, 2 Kings 4. 32. Jonah by prayer is
raised out of the Whales belly, and Christ by prayer raises Lazarus.

4. The Key of Heaven. Elias prayed and it rained; and again he prayed that it
might not rain, and it did not rain; he could turn this Key which way he
pleased by his prayers, James 5. 17, 18. So it is said of Luther the Elias of
his time, Vir iste potuit quod voluit. He could but ask and have.

5. The Key of Hell. By prayer and fasting the Devil is cast out, Ni^il est
homine probo orante potentius. Chrysosto^.
Mat. 17. 21. By Luthers prayers one was recovered who had given his soul to
the Devil.

Thus we have seen what great encouragement we have to Pray, and in all our
straits to cry, Arise O Lord and help us.

Judge the earth.
Observation.
God is Judge of all the earth. All other Judges are but Substitutes and
Surrogates to this Judge of Judges. They are confined to their Circuits, but
all the world is his Circuit. Hence he is called the Judge of all the earth,
Genesis 18. 25. Psalm. 94. 2. Heb. 12. 23. A man may appeal from other Judges; Paul
appealed from Felix to Caesar: but God is the Supre^m Judge, there is none
higher then he, and so no appeals can be made from him, but all must end in
him; and therefore the Saints when they could have no Justice on earth, have
made their final Appeals to him who Judges righteously. So did David, 1 Samuel
24. 13, 14. and Jeremiah (Chap. 18. 19. and 20. 12.) and Christ, 1 Pet. 2. 23.
Take heed then of displeasing him who is King of Kings, and Judge of Judges.
Men are careful to get the favor of great men, (Pr^v: 29. 26.) but what will
it avail us to have all the great ones of the world for us, if the great God be
against us? choose rather to displease all the world, then to displease him; and
this concerns great ones; they must remember still that there is a greater then
they to whom they must shortly give an account of their Stewardship, and at
whose Bar they must stand to be judged themselves, See more in my Comment. on 2 Timothy 4. 1. p. 313. and 321.
who here have judged others, Rev. 6. 15. and 20. 12.

Thou shall inherit all Nat^o^s.
Observation.
All Nations are the Lord Inheritance, or, The Lord is the sole poss^ssor of
all the world, Deuteronomy. 10. 14. Job* 1. 11. Psalm. 24. 1, 2. the earth is the Lords
and the fullness thereof, he alone is the true Proprietary of it. This is his
universal Kingdom by right of Creation and Preservation. God has a special
interest in all people. The rich and the poor meet together, and the Lord is
the ma^er and great Protector of both, Job 34. 19. Prove. 22. 2.

1. Let us then adore and reverence the Transcendent Majesty of the great God;
if a man be King of one Kingdom, we stand in awe of him and reverence him as
some great man; and shall not we reverence the great God who is the King of the
Kingdoms of the world? whom will we fear if we do not fear him?

2. Let great ones remember from whom they have their power, riches, Kingdoms
and greatness, even from this great Possessor of heaven and earth. Let them
improve their power to his pra^se; else he that raised them can ruin them, and
he that gives them Kingdoms can take them away, Job 12. 17, 18. and 34. 24.
Dan. 2. 21. Let them not abuse the^r power in oppressing the poor, since as
good hands have made the one as the other. All Nations are Gods Inheritance and
the poor are a part of it as well as ^he rich. Let them assure th^mselves that
God will not suffer wrongs that are done to them to pass unpunisht, because
such as wrong them, wrong a part of his Inheritance.

3. It may comfort such as are banished from their habitations for the Testimony
of Christ and the profession of his truth: you cannot want though you have lost
all: ior the earth is the Lords and the fullness thereof. He is the possessor of
all the world, he has so rich a Mine can never want, Psalm. 23. 1. The Lions
natural and the Lions Metaphorical may want, but such as fear the Lord shall
lack nothing that may be for their good, Psalm. 34. 9, 10. Such meek ones shall
inherit the earth, Mat. 5. 5. In Christ their head all is theirs, the world is
theirs, and all that is in it was made more especially for their service, 1
Cor. 3. 21, 22.

To his Reverend Friend Mr. Thomas Hall, B. D. Pastor of Kings-Norton in

Esteemed Sir,
I Have now at last, in answer to your desires, and in pursuance of my promise,
sent you my Meditations on the 6th verse of the 82. Psalm. Indeed soon after
the Sermon was preached, I was sought to, that it might be printed; But I was
then scarce flegd (not having in years equald the days of the shortest month)
and so unwilling to ventur^ a flight into the world, lest I should fall. And
truly my Apology still must be with the good Father (when the fruits of his
youth were stolen to the Press) Infans eram, Hiero. in proae. ad Obad.
nec dum scribere noveram; Nunc, ut nihil aliud profecerim, saltem Socraticum
illud habeo, Scio quod nes^io. Such as it is, I commend it to you; and the more
cheerfully, because its younger brother, which two or three years since,
supplanted it, and got away the birthright, did meet with a blessing. The good
Lord make it instrumental (in these unhappy and unholy days, wherein Moses and
Aaron, Magistracy and Ministry are trampled under foot) for the glory of his
Name, and the good of his people. So prays he who never saw you, yet loves
and honors you, and desires to be frequently and fervently remembered by you
at the throne of grace,

George Swinnocke.


TO THE READER.
IN my Exposition of the 82. Psalm, when I came to the 7th Verse, I perused a
Sermon of my Brother Swinnocks (which he preached before the Judges) on that
Verse. I found it so full and satisfactory, that I must freely confess I
received more Light from that single Sermon, then from all the Commentators
which I had by me. Whereupon (perceiving by his Epistle Dedicatory that he had
preached an Assise Sermon on Verse the sixth, which lay by him Unprinted) I
requested him to publish it with my Commentary on this Psalm; and thou have it
here annexed to it. The Author and his Labors are above my praise; If thou
please to accept of these our fraternal first fruits (if the Lord bless us with
life and health together) thou may expect ere long from us a Commentary on
Psalm 73. a Psalm very seasonable for us in these times, who are exercised with
such variety of Providence. It were to be wished that the Ministers of the
Gospel would join their strength in the promoting the truth: Jesuits can do so
to destroy it, why should not we in defending it? That it may be so, is the
desire, and shall be the endeavor of

THE Dignity of MAGISTRACY, AND THE Duty of the MAGISTRATE.
PSALM. 82. 6, 7. I have said ye are Gods, and all of you are Children of the
Most High.

But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the Princes.


THE Book of Psalms may not unfitly be called The Analogy of Faith, the
Directory for Practice, the Epitome of Scripture, the Platform for Prayer: It
is abbreviated in two words, Hosanna signifies Save I pray thee, or preserve I
beseech thee.
Hosanna, Allelujah, Praise ye the Lord.
Allelujah. Prayer and Praise being the sum and Substance of the whole Book.

It is a throng of holy affections (says one) each passion acting a part,
wound up to the highest strain by the Spirit of God, breathing Poetical
eloquence into the heavenly Prophet.

This 82. Psalm contains a reprehension of Princes, for their oppression of
the people, and it is propounded partly by way of Objurgation, partly by way of
Affirmation.

The Text presents us with a Concession of the Magistrates Allegation for
their illegal proceedings. They argued that because they were Gods, they might
tyrannize over men; That the stamp of a Deity on them would make them current
com, though they were never so light. The Holy Ghost grants them to be Gods,
but denies the consequence, that therefore they may live as they list, and
rule according to their lusts, or do the work of the Devil: For though they are
Gods in respect of their Places, and Power, yet they are Men in respect of
their frailty, and nature. They must die like men, and fall like one of the
Princes.

The 6. verse cloatheth men with Majesty; I have said ye are Gods, etc.

The 7. verse cloatheth Gods with Mortality: But ye shall die like men; They
are Gods, (...), that is, in their Politic capacity in regard of their power
and rule; but they are not so (...), in their Physical capacity, and in regard
of their nature and essence.

Though ye are now above others, go Dixi Concessio est, qua tamen ostendit
Propheta, nihil perversis Iudicibus praesidii fore in facta persona quam illis
Deus imposuit. Calv. in loc.
yet shortly ye shall be laid as low as others; and then ye shall both answer,
and suffer for wronging of others: The height of your places will not excuse
the wickedness of your practices: for though ye are high, yet there is one
higher then the highest of you, to whom you must give an account of all your
injustice and oppression.

We see then that the sixth verse contains a Concession of the Magistrates
power, how it is by divine appointment and institution.

In it we may take notice, First, of the Magistrates Honor; Ye are Gods, and
children of the most High.

Secondly, The Author of it. I have said it.

Or the Text presents us, ^* With the Magistrates Commission; Ye are Gods,
and children of the most High. 2. Its Seal or Confirmation; I have said. The
Commission for Magistracy is here confirmed under the broad Seal of Heaven.

I, i. e. I that am the Lord of Lords, and King of Kings, The Meaning of the
words.
the mighty possessor of Heaven and Earth; I that am Commander in Chief of the
whole world, and have power to appoint whom I please to be my Vicegerents, do
call and constitute you to be my Deputy Lieutenants on earth. I whose word is
sufficient warrant for any Office, or Ordinance; I have said ye are Gods.

Have said. How God speaks, is a point almost unspeakable. God speaks or
^aith as well as man, but not after the same manner; he does not form a voice
by such organs or instruments of speech. But when God speaks, He does either
create a voice in the air, as Matthew. 3. 17. or declare and make known his mind,
sometimes secretly and immediately to the spirits of the Prophets; so that
phrase The word of the Lord came unto me, so frequently used in Scripture, is
to be understood; sometimes publicly and mediately by the Prophets to the
people.

So then, I have said, that is, I have in my Word manifested this to be my
will; That ye sho^^ (...) Gods amongst men, Exodus 21. 28. I that speak (...)
none may (or who dares) disannul it: I who said (...) there be light, and
there was light; I who appoin^^ (...) the Sun to rule the day, the Moon and the
Stars (...) rule the night; I have said, Be ye Gods, and (...) shall be Gods. I
have appointed you in power an^ dignity to excel others, and to rule over them
on earth, as the greater Luminaries do the lesser in the Heavens.

Ye are Gods. That is, in my place and stead amongst men. To receive honor
from them both of reverence and obedience; To distribute justice amongst them
both zealously and impartially. To be terrors to evil doers, and
encouragements to them that do well; To govern from love to my Name, according
to the rule of my Law, for my honor and praise, as likewise the good and
profit of the people.

The word God is taken diversely in Scripture,

1. Properly, and so it is given only to him who is Essentially and by Nature
God. Who is an Infinite being of himself, and from whom all others have their
being. And in this sense it is mentioned sometimes Generally without any
Limitation, to a certain person, as Heb. 12. ult. John 4. 24. sometimes
Singularly with a Determination to one person, as to the Father, John 3. 16. to
the Son, Romans 9. 5. 1 Timothy 3. 16. to the Holy Ghost, 1 Cor. 3. 16, 17.

2. Improperly, and so it is given to them, who by nature are not Gods. As*

1. To the Devil in regard of his unjust usurpation, and wicked men's
corruption, 2 Cor. 4. 4. He is called, The God of this world: He usurpeth the
honor and Sovereignty of God, Matthew. 4. 9. and the wicked world obeys him,
as if he were a God, John 8. 44. The God he is, not of the world simply, but of
this world, of this sinful world that lies in wickedness, 1 John 5. 19.

2. To Idols in regard of the false persuasion of degenerate man, Caelestes,
Aerii, Terres^res, Marini dii. As many Gods as creatures almost amongst the
Heathen.
1 Cor. 8. 4, 5. There are Gods many, and Lords many; that is, in their
concelts, who were Heathen (They worshipped stocks and stones, any thing, yea
almost all things) though an Idol be nothing, in the judgment of a Christian;
It is nothing says the Apostle, i. e. formally, the thing signified is
nothing, yet materially it is something, as made of wood, or brass, or the like.

3. To Magistrates, Exodus 4. 16. who have their Commission from God, Romans 13.
who do the work of God, 2 Cor. 13. Romans 3. 4. who ought to do all for God, 2 Chronicles. 19. 6.

And all of you are children of the most High. It was no wonder that they were
called Gods: for here they are the children of the most High: Now children are
called after their Fathers Name.

This term Son of God, And ye all sons of the most High. Ain^w. leg.
or child of the most High is attributed

1. To Christ, because of his Eternal Generation, Psalm. 2. 7. He is the only
begotten of the Father, John 3. 16.

2. To Angels, both Because of their practice; they serve God, not as slaves a
Master; but as children a Father, cheerfully, heartily, with fisial alacrity
and delight. And because of their privilege; God uses them not as slaves, but
sons. They are near him always, beholding the face of their Father, Matthew. 18.
10.

3. To men, and that in regard of the purity and holiness in them, they
resemble God as a child his Father; or in regard of the grace and favor God
bestows on them; in these respects all believers are the children of God: Or
in regard of their power and greatness, they are privileged to be higher then
others in place, as sons are before and above servants. And they are like him
in their Dignity and Authority; Ainsw. in (...)
so Magistrates. The Chaldee paraphraseth, As the Angels of the high God;
because Magistrates should be like Angels for wisdom, 2 Samuel 14. 24.

The words being thus opened, will yield us this Doctrine.

Doctrine.
That the God of Heaven has appointed Magistrates to be Gods on earth.

He is God by Nature, and he has given them to be Gods by Name. The Deity was
by Incarnation clothed with the Humane Nature; and Humanity is here by Gods
designation clothed with the divine name, I will praise thee before the Gods,
says David; Psalm. 83. 1. that is, The tune of my heart shall be high in
singing thy praise, even before them that are by thy command highest in place.

The Sun in the higher world shines most gloriously, yet he communicates some
of his light to the Moon, whereby she surpasses (and is as Queen among) the
glittering Stars: So God the true Sun is infinitely above all; he shines
eminently with his own native light and luster; yet he bestows of his beauty
and brightness on some men, whereby they excel and are above others in this
lower world.

For the Explication of this truth, I shall only show in what respects
Magistrates are called Gods, and then proceed to Application.

Magistrates are in a twofold respect called Gods.

1. In respect of their honorable dignity. 2. In respect of their answerable
Duty.
It speaks that their privilege is high, and that their practices should be
holy.

1. In respect of their Dignity, Ceterum hic nomen sicuti paulo post, and aliis
locis pro judicibus sumitur, quibus specialem gloriae notam insculpsit Deus,
Calv. in Psalm. 82. 1.
God speaks the nature of Magistracy to be honorable by the names which he
gives to the Magistrate. Government is not a mean employment, but a great
preserment. Magistracy is here by God himself invested with Majesty.

It is observable that God ascribes to Magistrates the most honorable names
among men. Great men, 2 Samuel 3. 38. Nobles, 2 Chronicles. 23. and 30. Princes, Psalm.
83. 11. Kings, his Kings, Psalm. 18. ult. Fathers, Magnifica existimatio, Honor,
Gloria. Eras.
1 Samuel 29. 11. Chief of the people, Judge. 20. 2. Heads over the people, Exodus
18. 25. Dignities, Glories, Jude v. 8. The Ancients of the people, Isai. 3. 12.
not only because aged persons were ordinarily elected; for with the ancient is
wisdom, and in length of days understanding, Job 12. 12. but also because
Maxima d^betur capiti, etc.
aged persons are honorable persons. Men are commanded to bow down before the
hoary head, and reverence the Ancient, Levit. 19. 32.

Nay, God gives Magistrates not only those names which are in most esteem
amongst men; but the names of Angels.

Angels are the perfection, as it were, of the Creation, the top-stone of this
glorious building. When the Spirit of God would speak a thing, or person to be
excellent, it does resemble them to Angels. My Lord is wise as an Angel of God,
2 Samuel 14. 20. And Acts 6. 15. They beheld his face as if it had been the face
of an Angel. Farther the great happiness of holy ones in heaven is set forth by
their likeness to Angels; They shall be as Angels, Matthew. 22. and 30. Now what
glorious persons then are Magistrates, that have the names of Angels given
them; Angels are called Dominions, Principalities, Powers, Col. 1. 16. Ephesians.
1. 21. So are Magistrates, Jude v. 8. Titus 3. 1. Be subject to Principalities
and Powers; But the Text speaks more of their dignity. Magistrates have not
only the highest names of the most honorable visible creatures, Men; and of
the most honorable invisible creatures, Angels; but of the Creator, of God
himself, the Fountain and Standard of all Dignity and Honor; I have said ye
are Gods. When Jacob would manifest to Joseph's children the extraordinary
respect he had for their father, he does it thus; My Name be named on them, and
the Names of my Father Abraham and Isaac, Genesis 48. 16. It is a great honor to
be called the servant of God. Paul gloried in this, Titus 1. 1. So did David,
more in being a subject to God, then a King over men, Psalm. 36. Ti^e. It is a
greater honor and favor to be called Gods son, Ioh. 1. 12. 1 Ioh. 3. 1. Is it
a mean thing, says David, to be the Kings Son in law? 1 Samuel 18. 23.
Magistrates are children of the most High, they are ^ons to the King of Kings.
But the greatest honor of all is to be called Gods; for God to say My name be
named on them, This is the highest name that can be given; Here is a ne^^plus
ultra. This is the highest Name which is above all names, and as the Diamond to
the Ring, adds both virtue and value to whatsoever it is affixed.

As because Gold is the most precious excellent metal, therefore we lay gold
over other things; we guild peuter, brass, yea silver it self. So because God
is the most excellent name, it is laid to other things, that thereby their
worth may be set forth: As the Sons of God, Job 1. 6. The City of God, Psalm.
46. 4. The River of God, Psalm. 65. 9. The Kingdom of God It is ordinary in the
Hebrew to add the name of God to a thing to heighten the excellency of it. A
man of God is as much as an extraordinary man, an excellent man. It is said of
the Church compared to a Vine, She sent forth her branches as goodly Cedars,
Psalm. 80. 10. so we read it; But in Hebr. As the Cedars of God, that is, tall,
and excellent Cedars; and so in many other places, because all the creature
excellencies are derived from him, and are but a drop, a beam, a print of that
Glory and Majesty which is in him.
.

Now in their dignity Magistrates resemble God in these two or three
particulars, Dii per analogiam tanquam Deum imitantes. Theodor.
and therefore are fitly called Gods.

First in receiving honor from others. This is a godlike prerogative. God is
clothed with Mijesty and honor, Psalm. 104. 1. The blessed and only Potentate,
to whom all people must pay this tribute. In this the Gods on earth resemble
him.
Honor accompanyeth power as the shadow the body. There is naturally in man an
aw and respect toward those that are Magistrates: They are the Fathers of
their Country, and their subjects like children owe them both obedience and
reverence. Divine worship is to be given only to God in heaven, but civil
worship may be given to Gods on earth. David speaks of himself being a King,
His glory is great in thy salvation, Honor and Majesty have thou put upon him,
Psalm. 21. 5.

Joseph when advanced to be a Ruler in Egypt, rides in the second Chariot, and
has one crying before him, Genesis 41. 42, 43.
Bow the knee. The most high God that gives them Kingdoms, does also give them
Glory and Majesty, and honor, Dan. 5. 28, 29. God indeed has the greatest
honor as the Supreme Governor and Lawgiver, but Magistrates receive it upon
his account, as they are his Representatives and Vicegerents. Job 29. 7, 8. Job
fuit Rex.
When I went out to the gate, says Job, (that is, to the place of administering
justice, for that work was done in the gates, as Ruth 4. 1. Job 5. 4. Psalm.
127. 5.) the young men saw me, and hid themselves, and the aged arose and stood
up, the Princes refrained talking, and they laid their hands on their mouths,
Job 29. 8, 9.

My son, says Solomon, fear thou the Lord and the King, Prove. 24. 21. God is
the proper object of fear; (...)
hence the Greeks call him fear; but the Gods because invested with his
authority, and entrusted with the administration of his Kingdom upon earth, are
also to be feared as Superior to us, though inferior to God.

Secondly, their dignity appears (and in this they resemble God also) in
giving Laws to others. Magistrates have power to enact laws for the encouraging
of virtue, This is a Godlike privilege, Isa 33. 21. to make laws for men, to
prescribe what creatures shall do; and what they shall forbear* Zanch* d^
Magistrate.
and discouraging of vice, for the preservation of peace among their people.
Zanchy says There are three offices of the Magistrate, whereof one is to
ordain laws for the worship of God, and the welfare of men.

There is indeed one Supreme and absolute Lawgiver, James 4. 12. whose will and
word must be the rule of others laws. Besides in spirituals, none can give laws
to bind the conscience but God, Isa. 33. 21. In that sense, The Lord is our
Judge, the Lord is our Lawgiver; but in external policy the Laws of men are to
be observed. And they have power to make such laws as are suitable unto, and
convenient for the wealth and safety of their Dominions.

The end of Magistracy shows their legislative authority; for neither will
piety be promoted, nor the public good procured, or peace preserved without
it. And questionless God would never have enjoined Subjects to obey, if
Magistrates had not power to command.

Laws are the walls and Bulwarks of a Nation, That Commonwealth only can be
safe where the people obey the Magistrate, and the Magistrate the Law. Solo ^*
which in a great part may secure it against invasions from abroad, and
insurrections at home. The s^a^ding Militia which protecteth the lives of the
people. The hed^e which keeps men in from oppressing their neighbors. The
deeds and evidences which give us a right and title to our estates. They are
the nerves and sinews of the Body Politic, or as Physic to the natural body,
to prevent diseases and purge out ill humors.

Man is by nature an untamed Heifer, loathing the yoke of subjection, prone to
rage and rebel; so that he needs all means imaginable to rule and restrain
him. The wise Governor of all things has therefore thought fit not only to
give Christians a natural law and moral law from himself, but also positive
laws from men, that this threefold cord which is not easily broken may bind him
fast. And this surely speaks Magistrates to be like God; for even the Heathen
themselves would ascribe their laws to some one of their Gods. Zorastres who
gave laws to the Persians, ascribed them to Oromazen. Trismegistus among the
Aegyptia is ascribed his Laws to Mercurius; Lycurgus, who gave laws to the
Lacedaemonians, would make Apollo the Author of them. S^lon and Draco among the
Aehenians, said that Minerva was their Lawgiver. So almost in every Nation
they who had the Legislative Power, ascribed the invention of their laws to
their false gods. But the Word of God which is a perfect rule for all men, does
empower Magistrates to make^^aws (not according to their lusts, but) agreeable
to his revealed will.

Thirdly, Three uses of the civil sword. 1. Ad vind ctam. 2. Ad protection^m
b^ner^m. 3. Ad executionem justitiae. Willet. in Rom 13.
The dignity of Magistracy (wherein they likewise are like to God) consists
in their executing the Law. In punishing the nocent and acquitting the
innocent. Execution is the life of the Law; the luster and glory of the Prince,
the security of the good people. A Law unexecuted is like a sword without an
edge for no use or service. And a Magistrate that neglects his duty herein,
is like a Winters Sun, glorious for Majesty, but yielding no warming or
refreshing influences to them that are under him; or like the Kings head on a
signpost only for show.

The God of heaven does not cast away the perfect man, nor help the evil doer,
Job 8. 20. He beholds the righteous with favor, he wounds the heads of
sinners, Psalm. 68. 21. He cutteth off the workers of iniquity: He kills and
makes alive, with him is the fountain of life, Psalm. 39. 9. as waters flow
from a Fountain, so does life from God. And he can easily slay men, Job 4. 9.
By the blast of God they perish. To save and kill is a God-like privilege: The
power of life and death is in the hands of these earthly Gods: they enliven
with their smiles; their favor or the light of a Kings countenance is life;
they kill with their frowns; The wrath of a King is the messenger of death,
Prove. 16. 14, 15. Herein their dignity and civil God-ship appears that they
can give (by reprieve or pardon) or take away a life which is forfeited to the
Law. Plut. in vit. Caes.
Caesar's speech was high (when he was opposed by Metellus in his taking away
the money out of the Roman Treasury) Let me alone, or I will kill thee
presently; and then to qualify his threat, and magnify his strength, he told
him, Young man, thou know it is harder for me to speak it, then to do it.
But this is certain, Rulers are not for nothing called Powers, Tit. 3. 1. It is
in their power (though not to Tyrannize at their pleasure, yet) to execute the
Laws even to the death of the offender.

2. (...) dii vocantur (...) sunt vicarii dei in administ ando jure, exequenda
justitia, tucndo bono; puniendo m^l^s Polan. syntag lib. 7. cap. 19
Magistrates are called Gods not only in regard of there dignity, but also in
regard of their duty. They ought to resemble God in their execution of Justice
amongst men: God administreth Justice impartially, and so should the Gods.

The Judge of all the earth does right, and the Judges that are on the earth
should do right. God does judge the world in righteousness, and ministers
judgment to the poor in uprightness, Psalm. 9. 8. And they who rule over men,
must be just, ruling in the fear of God, 2 Samuel 23. 3.

Justice and Judgment are the habitation of Gods Throne, Propheta ad regum
insignia vel pomp as alludens, dicit judicium and justitiam effe ^alturam solii
e^us, acsi deceret loco sceptri, vel purpurae vil diadematis, his iasignibus
ornari deum quo justus, and aequus in indi judex.
Psalm. 89. 14. The holy Ghost alludeth to the Thrones of earthly Princes, which
were underpropped with Pillars (as Solomon's Throne with Lions, 1 Kings 19, 20.)
that were both a support and an ornament to it. Now says the Psalmist, Justice
and Judgment are the Pillars upon which Gods Throne stande^h, or (as Calvin
expounds it) the Robe and Diadem, the Purple and Scepter, the Regalia with
which Gods Throne is adorned. Thus Magistrates ought to make good their
pattern, and to take heed what they do, because they judge not for man, but for
the Lord who is with them in the Judgment, Calvin in loc.
2 Chronicles. 19. 6. Magistrates are therefore called Gods, because they should (as
God does) do impartial justice without respect of persons, Large Annot. in
Exodus 22. 28.
protecting the godly, as being the Ministers of God for their good, Romans 13.
4. and punishing the wicked which are malignant enemies to God and them.

Now the impartiality of the Gods (as of God) in executing justice appears in
these three particulars.

First in not favoring any for their neerness: Magistrates must imitate God in
this, who is no respecter of persons, but judges every man according to his
works, 1 Pet. 1. 17. Though Coniah be to me, says God as the Signet on my
right hand, yet I will pluck him thence, Ier. 22. 24. Etiamsi suisset Jeconia^
mihi charissimus, quem s^mper in ocul^s fcrrem* Jun. in loc.
That is, though he were as near and dear to me as a Kings sealing-ring which
is most carefully kept and tenderly preserved, worn commonly, yea continually
on some finger, yet I would do justice in plucking him off and casting him from
me. Nay when Gods own Son (who was the Son of his infinite love and choicest
delight) became liable to the lash of the Law, as being a sinner by imputation,
God would not spare him in the least, but made him bear the curse of the Law,
Romans 8. 32. Zaleucus the Lawgiver having enacted that every person guilty of
adultery should lose both his eyes, did yet when his own Son was found guilty
of that fault, put out one of his own eyes and one of his Sons. But the great
God was more just when his Son was a Surety for sinners; he caused him to pay
the utmost farthing, he suffered the law to have its full stroke at him. O how
just was God that rather then violate the least Tittle of his Law, would sign a
warrant with his own hand and confirm the Commission with his own Seal for his
dearest Sons execution!

Thus should Magistrates hear and determine without any respect to friends or
relations, Prosopol^psis dici^ur, si q^us paribus imparia, vel imparibus paria
tribuat. Coc.
Prove. 24. 23. To have respect of persons is not good, yea it is very evil.
Magistrates must hear the cause, not the person; and mind, not the man, but the
matter which is brought before them.

David was faulty (and he smarted sharply for it) iu sparing Amnon guilty of
Incest, and Absalom guilty of Murder, because they were his Sons. But Levi did
nobly who said to his Father and to his Mother, I have not seen him, neither
did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own children, Deuteronomy. 33. 9.

Pompey aspiring to the Roman Empire, Plutarch, in Vit. cat. (...)
and perceiving that Cato was against him, sent his friend Minucius to Cato to
demand his two Nieces; One for himself, the other for his Son. But when the
Messenger had delivered his errand, Cato gave him this Answer; Go tell Pompey,
Cato is not to be won by women; as long as Pompey shall deal uprightly, I shall
be his friend, and in a greater degree then any marriage can ever make me.
Surely this Moralist will condemn many Christian Rulers, of whom it is said,
that the Sun might as soon be hindered from running his race as he from doing
what was just and upright.

God will not upon any pretense whatsoever have his own person accepted, Job
13. 8. much less the persons of men.

Secondly, In not sparing or fearing any for their greatness. Rulers ought to
be men of courage, Exodus 18. 21. The fear of man brings a snare, Prove. 29. 25.
and is often the cause why justice is perverted: Pilate feared Caesar, John 19.
12, 13. and therefore against his conscience condemned Christ. The great God of
heaven fears none, spares none for their glory or greatness. He puts the
mighty out of their Seats, Luke 1. 52. He binds Kings in chains, and Princes
in Fetters of Iron, Psalm. 149. 8. The day of the Lord shall be upon all the
Cedars of Lebanon that are high and lifted up, and upon all the Oaks of Bashan,
and upon all the high Mountains, and upon every high Tower, and upou every
fenced Wall, Isa. 2. 12, 13, 14. He is the Almighty, Alpowerfull God, and
therefore cares not for any might or power of man.

Thus the Gods on earth should do justice on all, great as well as small,
fearing none but the God of heaven, Deuteronomy. 1. 17. you shall not be afraid of the
face of man, for the judgment is Gods. Papinianus is worthy of eternal memory,
who chose rather to die then to justify or excuse the fratricide of B ssianus
the Emperor. Holy Job as he was eminent for fearing God, so likewise for not
fearing men, Job 29. 17. I brake the jaw of the wicked and pulled the spoil out
of his teeth. Great men oftentimes are like Lions, or ravenous Beasts, that
prey on others without fear or pity. Now the care of this pious Magistrate was
to secure his people against such oppressors.

When David kept his Fathers sheep, and there came a Lion and a Bear, and took
a Lamb out of the stock, David rose after the Lion and smote him, and took the
Lamb out of his mouth, 1 Samuel 17. 34. Every Magistrate is or should be a
Shepherd. God says of Cyrus, He is my Shepherd, Isa. 44. ult. The man after
Gods own heart was called to seed his people Israel, Psalm. 78. 70, 71. Homer
calls Agamemnon (...), the shepherd or the feeder of the people. And when
Lions or Bears (men that are great and strong) come to devour their flock, they
ought to protect or defend them. He is a base hireling that hides his head when
the Wolf comes in the night, though he endeavor to preserve his sheep from
injury by the flies in the day. For one Wolf will do more mischief in a night
then a thousand flies in a year. As the day of judgment will make no
difference between great and small, rich and poor, noble and ignoble; for then
the Kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief
Captains and the mighty men will hide themselves in the dens, and in the rocks
of the Mountains, and will say to the Mountains and rocks, Fall on us and hide
us from the wrath of the Lamb, Rev. 6. 15, 16. so should not the day of
executing justice in this world Of Trajan the Emperor it is said that he
neither feared nor hated any man, but that he heard the causes of his subjects
witho^t prejudicate impiety, examined them without finister obliquity, and
judged them without unjust partiality.


The impartiality of God, and also of the Gods, consists in not taking gifts.
God is no taker of gifts, 2 Chronicles. 19. 7. Riches prevail not in the day of
wrath, Prove. 11. 4. Neither silver nor gold can deliver them from his
indignation, Zeph. 1. 18.

Thus should Magistrates resemble his Majesty, not perverting justice either
for having, or for hope of a reward. A bribe received or expected clogs or
obscures the course of Justice. A golden pen must not write the discharge: when
the hand of a Judge is greased with gold, it cannot hold the sword of justice,
but will let it slip, at least strike very partially.

Thou shall not wrest judgment, thou shall not respect persons, neither take a
gift; for a gift does blind the eyes of the wise, and pervert the words of the
righteous, Deuteronomy. 16. 19.

The Roman story tells us of two persons that were Competitors for some place
of preserment, and that a Senator being asked, for which of the two he would
give his voice; answered, For neither; because says he, One has nothing, and
the other has never enough. He knew that poverty and covetousness are both
unmeet qualifications for a Ruler. The former makes Magistracy obnoxious to
contempt and derision, and the latter prompteth the Magistrate on to injustice
and oppression.

A Ruler that is a bribe-taker is a Thief in Robes, Privati fur^s in compedibus
aeta'em agu^t, publici vero in auro and purpura visuntur. Cat.
and is only differenced from those that are in rags, by this, that the height
of his place does increase his sin and aggravate his condemnation.

I come now from the Explication to the Application of the doctrine.

This truth will be useful, First by way of Information. If the God of heaven
has appointed Magistrates to be Gods on earth: it informs us that Magistracy
is of divine Authority: Government is not an invention of some men, who desire
to Lord it over others; but it it the Institution of God. I have said ye are
Gods. Omnis p^t^st^^ a summa p^testate.
The Scholars of Pythagoras counted his Ipse dixit to be sufficient. Surely
then Gods saying it must be an establishing it to us. If where the word of a
King is, there be power, Eccl. 8. 4* then questionless where the word of a God
is, there is warrant enough for any Office. Non de quolibetiverbo Dei^ sed de
speciali dominandi mandato. Calv.
Now this is the Word of God which comes to the Magistrate, as Christ says,
John 10. 35. authorizing him and appointing him to that Ordinance. The
Magistrate is therefore called the Minister of God, Romans 13. 4. As Justices are
called the Kings Justices, because they act by Commission from him: so
Magistrates are called the Lords Ministers, because they rule by authority
derived from the Lord. Coin is carried to the Mint, and there stamped with the
Superscription and Image of the chief Magistrate, and then called his Coin,
because current by his authority.

Governors are not of the Devil, as Satanical spirits have affirmed, nor of
men, as others have asserted; but of God, Romans 13. 1.

As in the waters there be some greater, some smaller fish; and in the earth
there be Mountains and Hills as well as Plains and Valleys; and in the Heavens
there are Stars differing from each other in glory; so amongst men there are
some greater then others in power, higher in place, and excelling them in
authority and glory.

As the natural body is distinguished by God himself into comely and uncomely
parts, 1 Cor. 12. 23, 24. so is the Political body into members. Noble and
Ignoble.

The Bees in their Commonwealth (as is reported) have a Commander in chief, a
Master Be. The Lion claims a command and superiority among the Beasts of the
field. The Angels in heaven have a chief, Michael the Archangel, Jude 9. 1
These. 4. 16. The Schoolmen indeed being more bold then they ought, do divide
the Angels into three Hierarchies, and each Hierarchy into three several
orders. The first Hierarchy they say comprehends Cherubims, Seraphims, and
Thrones: The second, Dominions, Principalities, and Powers. The third, Mights,
Archangels, and Angels: As also they assert the reason of these several names.
But the more modest and learned Expositors who join not in the aforesaid
presumptuous division, do yet generally conclude an order, distinction, and
pre-eminence amongst Angels, from Ephesians. 1. 21. Col. 1. 16. Dan. 10. 13. Nay,
there is a government amongst the very Devils; there is not only a Prince of
Angels, Dan. 10. but Beelzebub a Prince amongst Devils, Matthew. 12. 24. They
that cause so much disorder amongst others, yet have some order among
themselves. We read of the Devil and his Angels, Matthew. 25. 41. There is a kind
of government in Hell, though some would turn all out of the earth.

The Apostle Peter indeed calls Magistracy an ordinance of man, 1 Pet. 2. 13.
though Paul assures us it is of God; The Powers that be are ordained of God,
Romans 13. 1. And the Magistrate is the Minister of God, verse. 4.

Magistracy is an ordinance of man in a fourfold respect.

1. Subjective. As man is the subject thereof, by them it is executed. Our
Princes as well as our Prophets are men of like passions with us.

2. Objective. As man is the object thereof, about them it is exercised. It is
for the punishment of bad men, and encouragement of good men, for the deciding
differences between man and man.

3. (...), Finaliter. As man is the end thereof. He is the Minister of God for
man's good.

But these things will not prove Magistracy to be a mere humane Ordinance; for
in these three respects the Ministry as well as the Magistracy may be said to
be an humane Ordinance; Man being both the subject, object, and end thereof;
yet what sober man ever denied the ministry to be an Ordinance of God?

4. It is Ordinance of man in regard of the kind of it: Each Nation having a
liberty to choose what form of Government they apprehend most commodious for
them. Magistracy is Ordained by God, though this particular Magistrate, or this
form of Government be appointed by man. The Genus of Magistracy is from God;
yet the Species; whether Monarchy, Democracy, or Aristocracy may be at the
choice of men.

Further, though the Magistrate should be of the Devil, a wicked ungodly
person; yet the Magistracy is of God.

There is a difference between the Office or Power it self, and the manner of
exercising it, and the means of attaining it: The first is always of God, but
not always the second and third. The power of Nero was of God, (as the Holy
Ghost speakethl fully, Romans 13.) though he exercised it in a Devilish manner,
oppressing and killing the good, encourageing and acquitting such as were evil.
The power of our Richard the third was of God, though he attained it by ungodly
and devilish means, the murdering his own Sovereign and Nephew.

There are four particulars which will clearly demonstrate the truth of this
assertion, namely, That Magistracy is of Divine Authority.

First, (...) Hes.
Their Commission is from God. By me Kings Rule, says God, Prove. 8. 15.
Subordinate Magistrates may have their Commission from men; but Supreme
Magistrates have their Commissions from God only.

The Powers that be, are ordained of God, Rom^ 13. 1. not simply ordained of
God as other things, Willet in locum.
says a learned Interpreter; but specially by precept and command from God.
Cujus jussu homi^es, ejus jussu reges. Ireneus lib. 5. cap. 24.
There are other things of God (says he) as Famine, War, Sickness, Poverty,
but they are not ordained by Precept.

Daniel tells Nebuchadnezzar, that God had commissionated him to rule over
men, Dan. 2. 37, 38. Thou O King art a King of Kings; for the God of Heaven
has g^ven thee a Kingdom, power, and strength, and glory. And wheresoever the
children of men dwell, the beasts of the field, and the fowls of heaven has he
given into thy hand, and has made thee Ruler over them all; thou art this head
of Gold. These higher Powers are so clearly from the highest Power, that their
Throne is called Gods Throne, 1 Chronicles. 29. 23. Then Solomon sat on the Throne
of the Lord as King instead of David; their Scepter is called Gods Scepter, and
their judgment Gods judgment; Deuteronomy. 1. 17. Ye shall not respect persons; for
the judgment is Gods.

Besides, we find that several persons received their Regal Investiture from
God himself; as Saul, David, Iehu, Cyrus, which last was by God named and
ordained to the government of the Persian Monarchy above sixty years before he
was born, Isai. 44. 28. Isai. 45. 1

2. Their command to govern is from God; the several Precepts from God to men
in high places, does fully speak their power to be of God. Why should God
command them to rule according to his laws, who have no authority to rule at
all? Ier. 22. 2, 3. Hear the word of the Lord O King of Judah, execute
judgment and righteousness, and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the
oppressed, etc. If the matter or substance of their rnle were unlawful, surely
God would not own it so far as to prescribe rules for the manner of executing
it. Now God through the whole Scriptures scatters many precepts for
directions to Princes how they should govern, and what they should practice,
Deuteronomy. 17.

3. Their protection is from God. As a King defends his inferior officers in
the execution of their offices; so the King of Kings defends Magistrates in
the discharge of their trusts; God stands in the Congregation among the Gods,
Psalm. 82. 1. not only to observe whether they offer injuries to others, but
also to take care, that they receive no injuries from others. God is a stronger
guard to the Judge then any Sheriff. And were not he a wall of fire about some
worthy zealous Justices, many beastly persons (who have been curbed by them,
and hindered from leaping over the hedges of divine commands) would have
trampled them under feet, if not torn them in pieces.

It is worthy our observation how exceedingly God manifests his power and
zeal for the help of Magistrates against all opposition. Korah and his company
conspire against Moses and Aaron; Magistracy and Ministry, Numb. 16. and would
have brought in Anarchy. (Indeed both those Ordinances have the same
adversaries, Those that would level the Ministry, making Preachers
Ieroboam-like, of the lowest of the people, and filling the Pulpit as Noah's
Ark, with creatures clean and unclean, will at last level the Magistracy too,
and make the Throne as low and as common as the Pulpit.) But observe what God
says of these opposers of Magistracy and Ministry, and what God does to them:
for his saying; That they are gathered together against the Lord, verse. 11.
They wounded God through the sides of Moses and Aaron. They that murmur and
conspire against Gods Delegated servants, murmur and conspire against God
himself. And surely God will first or last be too hard for those that thus
harden themselves against him: For see what he does to them; The Earth opened
her mouth and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that
appertained unto Korah, and all their goods; they and all that belonged to them
went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed upon them, verse. 32. 33. God
has strange punishments for such strange principles and practices; He will
work miraculously, but that he will make such as are against Magistrate and
Minister exemplary.

Psa. 18. ult. Great deliverance gives God to the King. The Supreme Magistrate
is in great dangers; therefore God gives him great deliverances; as he is
liable to more harm then others, by reason of his place, so he may expect (if
he be godly especially) more help then others, by reason of the divine promise;
Be strong, and of a good courage, be not afraid; for the the Lord thy God is
with thee whither soever thou go, De bell^ Iudaic. lib. 62.
Josh. 9. Josephus from the extraordinary escape of Titus, at the view of the
walls of Jerusalem, observes, Imperatorum pericula Deum curare, That God is
the Magistrates guard.

4. Every one has in him the mind of a King. Calv. on 1 Pet. 5. 5.
The subjection of their people to them is from God. Every man is by nature a
Quaker, a Leveller, like a Colt unwilling to be bridled; like an untamed
Heifer, which cannot endure the yoke of subjection. It is therefore through the
wonderful working of God, that a few persons, or sometimes one man as head
should rule such a monstrous body as the multitude. If he that rules the
boisterous waves of the Sea, and shuteth them up with bars and doors, Psalm. 65.
7. did not put forth the same Almighty power in quieting the spirits, and
stilling the tumults of the people it could never be done. (...),
subjectingthem to me. Septuagint. leg.
Well might David say, It is God that subdueth my people under me, Psalm. 144.
12.

The multitude is an unruly monster. It was a true saying of that brutish
Emperor Tiberius, to one that applauded his felicity in attaining the power of
so large an Empire; Sueton.
O said he, you know not what a Beast the Empire is, how unruly and untoward,
how headstrong and hard to be tamed. The multitude is a Beast with many heads
says another: cut off one, nay many, yet there will millions remain still. Now
that one should keep millions in awe, how could it be, if there were not a
divine constitution in an humane person. The Devil is such an enemy to man's
peace and welfare; and every man's nature so opposite to rule and restraint,
that if there were not somewhat more then humane in Magistracy, one man would
be a Beast, nay a Devil to another, and be no whit kept under by the higher
Powers. But we see clearly God has put such a Majesty on Princes, that their
people are afraid of their fury; reverence their persons, and submit to their
authority. He that reads the wonderful strength of the Horse, how his neck is
clothed with thunder; how the glory of his nosthrils is terrible; how he
paweth in the Valley, and goes out to meet the armed men; how he mocketh at
fear, and is not affrighted, nor turns back from the sword, Job 39. 19. to
26. He that considers the power of the Elephant, how he moves his tail like
a Cedar; how his bones are like strong pieces of brass, and like bars of Iron.
etc Job 40. 15. to 24. when he observes how these strong fierce creatures are
ridden and ruled by weak man, and turned about at his pleasure, will presently
conclude the reason to be this, because God has put the fear and dread of man
upon every beast of the field, Genesis 6. 2. So truly he that beholds many
millions of men subject to the word, to the command of one, when they have
strength enough to overthrow thousands, must needs acknowledge that it is the
Lords doing, and it ought to be mavelous in their eyes.

Secondly, The second use by way of Information.
If Magistrates be Gods, and that by the appointment of the living God; (I have
said ye Gods) It informs us, ^That they are guilty of great impiety that
contemn and diisesteem Magistracy; they vi^ifie those whom God does dignifie,
and fight against God, in endeavoring to pull down that order and that
ordinance which he himself has set up. Such men by denying rule and authority,
s^em to be beasts, and to put off all humanity. For places without some in
power would be rather wildernesses then Cities, and the Inhabitants rather
herds of Beasts then Societies of men.

There are two sorts of men guilty of this sin.

First, those that in their Principles deny Magistracy to be from God. There
have in several ages been some, that because they themselves were subjects and
inferiors, would therefore deny all Sovereignty and Superiority. The Donatists
whom Augustine undertaketh, were of that opinion. And so were the Anabaptists
and Libertines in Germany, who (armed the rude multitude against their
Magistrates, and) were opposed by Luther. And truly in our days there are some
who against the light both of Nature and Scripture, affirm Government to be a
work of darkness. Though it be written in the fleshly tables of their hearts,
and in the tables of stone by the finger of God; That Fathers and Mothers civil
as well as natural must be honored, yet they are so wicked and blind, that
they will not fee or read it. In the Apostles days there were ungodly men that
turned the grace of God into lasciviousness, despisers of Dominions, Jude verse.
8. such as aimed at Anarchy (according to Calvin's Comment) and the overthrow
of all Authority; being proud they scorned rule; and being licentious, they
were impatient of restraint.

First, Order is needful to them that are in a state of innocence. Angels who
continue in their estate of integrity differ in point of Superiority; Michael
the Archangel, Jude v. 4. Michael speaks the name of his person, and
Archangel the nature of his office. There are Thrones, Dominions,
Principalities, Powers, different degrees among those Angelical spirits. Surely
if such order be conducible to the happiness of perfect Angels, it is the more
desirable for the happiness of imperfect man. And if there be such order in
heaven, it is no part of our bondage to have some order on earth; and therefore
the Grecians do upon good ground use the word (...) to signify Superiority, or
Government: which in its proper and native acception, signifies principium, to
set forth the antiquity of government, which had a being as soon as the world
had a beginning. Politic Government was probably then instituted, when man was
first created under the Old Covenant of works; for it is a natural blessing,
and grounded upon the fifth Command of the Moral Law, which commenced upon man's
first Creation before Adams fall, and the rather may we thus judge, because it
is a law of Nature, which was binding in man's estate of innocence; besides,
Christ himself who knew no sin, yet minded this duty of subjection, Luke 2 ^1.
1 Col. 16. 22. M^tth. 22. 23.


2. Order and Superiority are needful to them that are in a state of Apostasy;
the more wild man is, the more need he has of a yoke; the more heady our
Horses are, the more we curb them: Unruly persons for their own good as well as
for others, require restraint.

The hearts of wicked men are like the Sea which cannot rest, Augustine
thinks that all civil subjection of one man to another came in by sin, though
not all natural subjection of children to pa ents. De civit. Dei, lib. 19.
but is ever casting up mire and dirt; Now what a deluge would the boisterous
waves of their unsanctified wills and affections cause, if there were no banks
of Magistracy to bound them and keep them in. If some men were not Gods to
others, most men would be Devils to others.

Sin must be discouraged; evil doers must be punished; humane Society must be
preserved; the good must be protected; our liberties and properties must be
defended; justice must be executed; the poor must be relieved; wholesome laws
must be maintained; and how can either of these be done without Magistrates:
Many fear not sin, nor the God of Heaven; and if it were not for suffering from
the Gods on earth, their lusts should be their law, and they would deprive the
innocent of their liberties, estates, and lives, and turn the places where they
live into Acheldema's fields of blood; nay make the earth worse in some
respects then hell; for in hell there is no ^ppression, as no injustice; no
guilty person freed, and no guiltless person punished; but had these men their
wills, it should be so upon earth.

3. Again, Order or Magistracy is not only necessary to those that are in a
state of nature, but to those also that are in a state of grace, Titus 3. 1, 2.
Romans 13. 1, 2. When they begin to be servants to God, they do not cease to be
subjects to the Gods. Christianity does not consume but confirm Magistracy: As
a man I obey and honor the Magistrate for fear; as a Christian, for conscience
sake: so that Religion adds a stronger tie and obligation. The Scepter in
Christ's hand does not strike the Crown of the Mastrates head: No, it makes it
sit the faster, especially where their person is crowned with grace, and the
power improved for the glory of Christ. One Ordinance of God does not weaken
but strengthen another.

I shall inquire a little, and very briefly, into the reasons which some urge
against Magistracy and Order.

1. Say some, We are the Lords Freemen, and and therefore should not be
servants of men, 1 Cor. 7. 23. Ye are bought with a price, be not the servants
of men.

Answer.
That place indeed forbids sinful subjection to men, but not civil
subjection to men. I may serve a Prince, but I may not sin at his precept and
command; If men command what God forbids, I must disobey men to obey God. Or
that Text may import, that I must give no man liberty to give my conscience
laws; No, my absolute dependence for soul-direction must be only on Christ and
his Word.

Those whom Christ makes free are free indeed, but it is from bondage to their
own and others lusts, not from obedience to others righteous laws.

Objection 2.
Some tell us, They are just and need no law; for they are a law to themselves:
Now laws say they, are for them that are wicked. 1 Timothy 1. 9. The law is not
made for the righteous, but for the wicked.

Answer.
They that are so good that they need no laws for their correction, live among
the wicked, and therefore need laws for their protection.

That forecited place in Timothy is meant of the Moral Law, of which the
Apostle testifies, that believers are free from its curse or malediction; but
surely not from it as a rule for their conversations.

The hearts of the best are bad enough, and apt to wander, therefore they need
all means; the hedge of man's laws as well as of Gods laws to keep them in. Laws
are hedges both to fence them in from others violence, and to prevent their
their wandering out.

Objection 3.
Paul forbids going to law, 1 Cor. 6. 1, 2. therefore no use of a Magistrate.

Answer.
The Apostle does not absolutely forbid going to law; But 1. before Heathen
Judges, when godly Christians might have decided their differences and ended
their controversies. They that deny to refer their lighter causes to honest
understanding persons, give occasion to others to suspect both their causes and
Christianity, v. 1, 3, 4, 5. 2. Among brethren, the very name of brethren
should allay heats and charm discords, v. 8. The nearer their relation (though
spiritual) was, the dearer their affection should have been, and therefore the
sinfuller their division. 3. About trivial and small matters. If Mahometans go
to law for mean toys, they are punished. 4. With vindictive spirits: whereas a
Christian should go to law with a meek, mild, Gospel spirit, without either
hate or heat, as Tilters break their spears on each others breast, yet without
wrath or intention of hurt. So then it is not simply unlawful to go to law
before Heathen, if right cannot be had elsewhere, and the matter be weighty,
and we do it not out of spleen or malice, but with meekness and quietness of
spirit.

Objection 4.
They tell us, God is their Keeper; therefore they need neither Law nor
Magistrate for their defense.

Answer.
God is the good man's Keeper; but how? not immediately (in an ordinary way) but
mediately. As trust in God does not consist with trust in mea^s, neither
without use of means where God does afford them: for then Christ might have
taken the Devils Counsel, and have thrown himself down from the Pinnacle of the
Temple when God had afforded him stairs for his safe going down. Saints are
under the shadow of Gods wings principally. He is their chief Sun and Shield,
Genesis 17. 1. but they are under the shadow of the Gods wings subordinately, they
are the isntrumental shields of the earth, Psalm. 47. 9.

God can in regard of his absolute power protect his people without the shields
of the earth, against all the opposition from men: as he can defend immediately
from all the fiery darts of the Devil without the shield of faith, or the sword
of the spirit. He needs not the agency either of Magistrates in civil things,
nor Ministers in spiritual things but he has ordained both. It is his pleasure
that both should in subordination to him be used, and therefore neither can
without sinning against him be neglected.

Objection 5.
Say they, we may not avenge our selves; we must not render evil for evil, but
overcome evil with good, Romans 13.

Answer.
Though a Christian must rather suffer then offer injuries; yet he may, nay
must mind his own safety. He may not unjustly offend his Brother, but he may
justly defend himself.

All private revenge is forbidden, R. Willet in Romans 13.
but the Magistrate is Gods Minister; therefore as venge^n^e belongs unto
God, so the Magistrate may in Gods place take revenge, and one may implore his
help, as he may commit his cause to God, so it be not done with a revengefull
mind.

The meaning of the holy Scriptures is far different from the sense which the
Apostate Julian put on them. When he had taken away their estates, he put them
off with a mock, Your Master said, Blessed are the poor: and when he had sorely
beaten them with his hands, he would wound them with his tongue saying, Your
Master said If one beat you on one cheek turn to him the other. The Gospel
certainly was never intended for a cross, but a comfort to a Christian, and
though its principal aim be to further him spiritually, yet it never designed
to hinder him corporally by any of those commands. Magistratus necessarius
ecclesiae, quia a D^o ordinuus est ad defensionem Ecclesiae. Polan. Syntag lib.
7. c. 19*
Christ is more tender of his people, then to thrust them into the world like
sheep among ravenous Wolves, and to deny them leave of calling to those civil
shepherds to take care of them. God has for that end appointed Magistrates to
be nursing-Fathers, and nursing-Mothers to the children of God, to be as tender
of them, as provident for them, as helpful to them as Parents to their
children, as Nurses to their Babes. They are set up by God himself to be a wall
upon which the weak Ivy of the Church may lean, and by which it may be
supported.

Thus we see that piety is not opposite to authority; (...) accused (though
falsely) Luther to have animated Muncer the rebel-preacher in Thuringia.
though that faIse surmise that Christians were enemies to the policy and
government of Kingdoms, was the cause of several of the Persecutions in the
Primitive times. And indeed the Devil and his agents suggest to Princes to much
to alienate their affections from religious persons. But though some monstrous
bodies have brought forth such an hideous birth* That Religion denies all
Rule; yet you see how far the Gospel is from being the Father of such a Child,
when it commands lawful obedience to Infidel Magistrates. It establishes the
first Table, and surely does not abol^sh the second. Calvin in Romans
And Calvin thinks that least believers should think themselves free from that
yoke, Paul wrote the Epistle to the Romans, to inform them of the contrary. For
it is very strange to corjecture that that God which is the God of order in the
Churches, should be a God of confusion in the Commonwealth. No, but the
Original of this error is man's corrupt nature, which hates enclosures and
banks, and would have all common and level, that he might run to excess of riot
without any rubs or hindrances. And thence it is that like waters stopped at a
Bridge, he roareth and makes such a noise. As the mad dog is enraged because
of the chain that tieth him; and the unruly Horse foameth and fretteth, because
of the Bridle that curbeth him: So these men mad upon lust, cannot endure to be
chained by laws; these furious Horses would have the reins on their own necks.

Secondly, Those that in their practices, contemn Magistracy, sin against this
ttruth discovered in the Text; for they despise an Ordinance of God, Romans 13. 2.

Some sin in their words by uncivil disrespectfull language; The corruption of
their hearts breaks out of their lips; These filthy dreamers defile the flesh,
despise dominions, (...), they opposed not so much the Officers as the Office,
not so much the Magistrate as Magistracy,) (...), idem valet quod* (...),
alterius faman laedere maledicti.
speak evil of dignities, Jude ver. 8. they blaspheme glories. It is blasphemy
against the second Table. Our wicked times are a woeful Comment on that Text.
Those persons and places which are honored by the Spirit of God with glorious
Titles, are bespattered by them with dirty, disgraceful language. Because they
could not by the power of their hands displace the Magistrate* therefore with
the poison of their tongues they did disgrace Magistracy.

These men begin to speak evil of the Gods, and ordinarily end in speaking evil
of God himself. As Aretine by libellous and contumelious speaking against
Princes, came at length to disesteem God himself.

Observe how express the command of God is, Thou shall not revile the Gods, nor
speak evil of the Rulers of thy people, Exodus 22. 28. This text is quoted by
Paul, Acts 23. 2, 3. 5 where he called the High Priest whited wall, and
afterward said, he wist not that he was the High Priest: which words are very
much controverted by Expositors. So D^odat. in loc. Calvin.
Some think he spoke Ironically, because he saw nothing in him worthy of that
office, and because the Priesthood was now determined in Christ, Vide Joseph.
Antiq. lib. 20. cop. 3. 5.
he did usurp that Office which did not belong to him; and probably he was
some Surrogate brought in (through the disorder of the times) by some sinister
practices. Others (and that to me more likely) expound it thus, I wist not, I
considered not, I heeded not, in my haste, in heat I took not sufficient
notice, but termed him whited wall, which words I acknowledge might well have
been spared. Iun. in Parall.
The opinion of Iunius is that Paul did not know him to be the High Priest; and
therefore pleads his ignorance as (at least) an extenuation of his offense.
Seneca says of Egypt that it was lo quax and i^geniosa in contumeliam
praefectorum provincia: in qua q^i vitav^rit culpam, non effi^s git infamiam.
But whatever the sense of the words is, this is clear that such as revile
Princes, disobey Gods precept. Thou shall not revile the Gods, nor speak evil
of the Rulers of thy people, that is thou shall not speak evil of them by
reproach or calumny, nor wish any evil to them by imprecation or curses.

Nay, the Holy Ghost speaks the persons guilty of this sin to be impudent
audacious sinners, 2 Pet. 2. 10. They are not afraid to speak evil of
dignities; as if he had said, If they had feared either God or man, Lu^her
cried Henry the eighth mercy for his uncivil language, such as that Audi Domine
Rex, ed^cebo te.
they would not have dared to commit this sin. They were bold sinners indeed
that durst spit their venom in the faces of the Gods, and with the sword of
their mouths adventure upon the mouth of the sword. O to what an height of
unholiness are they arrived that bring railing accusations against the Gods,
when the Archangel durst not bring one against the Devil! Jude ver. 9. The
mother of Artaxerxes in Plutarch was wont to say, that they who addressed
themselves to Princes, should use silken words.
But their tongues are set fire on hell, James 3. 6. therefore no wonder if
they are set against heaven, Psalm. 73. 9. Is it fit to say to a King Thou art
wicked, and to Princes Ye are ungodly! Job 34. 18. The interrogation is a
strong negation. Kings must be courted with soft and silken language. If Elias
and Isaiah do otherwise, they being moved extraordinarily, are no copies for us
to write after.

As some sin in their words by uncivil language, so others in their works, by
their unseemly carriage toward the Magistrate. Surely the world is near its
end, that there are so many dregs appearing, such brutish persons in it that
have not only banished piety but humanity. They neither reverence the rulers
nor honor the ancient. How many are in their principles antiministerial, and
in their practices antimagistratical. As Nazianzen observes of the Arrians,
they began in blasphemous language against the Deity of Christ, but ended in
tumultuous carriage against the peace and tranquillity of the Commonwealth.
They plead for a Christain liberty with their mouths, but the vote of their
hearts carries it for an Antichristian licentiousness.

The time was when a Magistrate came by, the young men that saw him hid
themselves (either for reverence of Jobs person, or least they should fail in
their respectfull behavior toward him, or least he should spy somewhat amiss
in them) and the aged arose and stood up (in token of honor and to show
respect to him,) Job 29. 8. but now the tide is turned. We are fellow creatures
say some, and therefore we must be fellow-beasts, taking no notice of, nor
showing any respect to one more then another. But now says Job, they that are
younger then I, have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to
have set with the dogs of my flock, and now I am their Song, yea their byword:
they abhor me, they flee from me, they spit in my face, Job 30. 1, 9, 10. So
low indeed are they whom God has set on high, through the pride and
profaneness of men's hearts. Xenoph. Hellen, lib. 11*
One observes of the Persians, that when they came into the presence of their
Prince they drew their hands into their sleeves in token of reverence and
loyalty. But how many Christians come short of heathen, and that which is
saddest of all, under the pretense of religion? But such must know that by
contemning such men they contemn God. They have not rejected thee, says God to
Samuel, but they have rejected me, I Sam. 8. 7. not so much thee who art but my
Minister as my self, who being their Supreme Lord do rule by thee as my Deputy.
As Magistracy is Gods Ordinance, by despising this order which is by divine
appointment, they despise its author; as Magistrates are the resemblance of his
glory, Gods, Glories, by contemning the picture they contemn the person; and
they that thus dishonor God, shall be lightly esteemed by him. They thae
resist the Magistrate, shall receive to themselves damnation, Romans 13. 2.

My second use will be by way of Exhortation; First to Inferiors: If the God
of Heaven has appointed Magistrates to be as Gods on earth, it exhorts, us
to honor them. Honor the King, 1 Pet. 2. 17. Magistrates are palres pat^iae.
faith the Holy Ghost. Honor to whom honor belongs, Romans 13. 7. There is
honor due to our civil as well as to our natural Parents; so much is expressed
in that standing Law of God the fifth Commandment, Prohibiti sunt maledici,
no^ jussi sunt sacr^^^ honorari, Aug. in Exodus,
Exodus 20. Though they are to be honored as Gods, yet not as the true God;
civil respect is due to them, not divine. Yet some Roman Emperors out of
intolerable pride, have affected to be called Gods, and commanded others to
sacrifice to them. This civil honor is to be visible, 1. In giving reverence
to their persons. 2. In y^elding obedience to their righteous precepts.


First in reverencing their persons. Magistrates are honored by God, and
therefore may well be honored by us.

Those who are dignified by God, must not be debased by men.

We ought to honor them in our hearts, Ho^or est agnitio dignitatis vel
excellen^iae illius quae est in alio cum ejusdem debita testificatione. Agni^io
simul dicitur and testificatio, quia neque in externa observantia sola neque in
interna consistit, sed in Htroque. Ames. Med.
by standing in aw of them, by esteeming them as they resemble God, Prove. 24.
21. and are in his place to be higher and worthy then others; Thou art worth
ten thousand of us, say they to David, 2 Samuel 18. 3. The godly people counted
King Josiah The breath of their nostrils, Lament. 4. 20. And the Holy Ghost
brandeth them for sons of Belial that despised Saul in their hearts, though he
were a wicked King, 1 Samuel 10. 27. In our carrihage we must honor them by
rising up to them, Ioh 28. 9. by bowing the body to them, 2 Samuel 24. 20. by
silence when they speak, Job 29. 9, 10.

Honor is an outward signification of that inward reverend opinion which we
have of them for their dignity and greatness.

They are honored in our speeches. The Patriarchs call Joseph their Lord, Genesis
42. 10. and themselves his servants, verse. 19. Paul calloth, Act. 26. ^5. Most
Noble Festus. Hester 5. 8. If I have found favor in the sight of the King, and
if it please the King to grant my Petition, and to perform my request, says
holy Hester to the Heathen King.

It is reported of the great Grandfather of Fabius Maximus, (...)
that though he had been five times Consul, and had obtained many triumphs for
diverse honorable victories, yet when his own son was Consul, he willingly
submitted him self to him, served under him as his ^ientenant, and followed on
Horseback his son in his triumphing Chariot But such Heathen will rise up in
judgment against many Christians.

Secondly, M^llem obedire quam miracula facere. Luth.
your honoring them must appear by your yielding obedience to their lawful
ptecepts. In the Kingdom of Christ this is wonderfu, says Zanchy, Zanch.
Miscel. epi. ded.
That he wills and comman death all Princes and Potentares to be subject to
his Kingdom, and yet he wills and commands that his Kingdom be subject to
Princes and Potentates, Tit. 3. 1. Put them in mind to be subject to
Principalities and Powers, and to obey Magistr^tes. Subjection notes their
acknowledgment of obedience to be due, and obedience notes the act it self of
obeying, or the practice answerable to the forementioned principle. By
Principalities are meant those that have the Supreme power, as Kings or chief
Magistrates* Powers signify such as exerci^e delegated authori^y, and hold
from those higher Powers as Presidents of Provinces, Lieutena^ts of Counties,
Judges, Justices, Majors, etc. Now put them in remembrance* Men are apt to be
forgetful both of obedience to God and the Gods; Naturally we are so proud and
high, that we are unwilling to stoop to those that are higher; and therefore we
had need to be put in mind of our duties, to submit our selves to every
Ordinance of man for the Lords sake, whether to the King as Supreme, or unto
Governors as unto them that sent by him, 1 Pet. 2. 14. Good Rulers we must
obey, says one, as God; bad, for God.

But take notice, Magis obtemperandum est diis apud quos diutius manendum est
quam homi^ibus quibuscum admodum brevi tempore vivendum est. Antigon, in Sophoc.
I say, Magistrates must be obeyed in their lawful commands. If a King (says
our Civil Law) gives laws out of his own Territories, he is not to be obeyed.
And if Magistrates command what God forbids, they give laws out of their own
Dominions, and therefore says the Divine law, they are not to be obeyed. God
indeed is to be obeyed universally and unlimitedly, intuitu voluntatis, upon
the bare sight of his will; but I must examine the laws of men by the laws of
God, and if they are dissonant and disagreeing to Gods laws, I must be
disobedient to their laws. No mere man's Ipse dixit is sufficient, Acts 6. 29.
We ought to obey God rather then men. The men of Calicot say some, will do
whatsoever their Emperors command, though it he to worship the Devil, as some
write they do; but we must observe the order of commands, Fear God, is before
Honor the King, 1 Pet. 2. 17. And again, My son, fear the Lord and the King,
Prove. 24. 21. And Eccles. 8. 2. My son keep the Kings command, and that because
of the Oath of God; Vide Large Annotat. in loc.
which latter words, And that because of the oath of God, are not only a
reason, but as is excellently observed, a limitation to the precedent
Exhortation; They are a reason or enforcement: It is neccessary to give
obedience to Magistrates, not only out of fear toward them, because of their
sword; but out of conscience toward God, because of his vows that are upon us,
Romans 13. 5. and so it seems to relate to some Covenant and Oath of fidelity,
which was taken by the people toward their Princes, 1 Chronicles. 11. 3. Isai. 19.
18. And surely Oaths to Magistrates are to be kept, though some slip Oaths as
easily as the Monkies do their collars; and like the man possessed with the
Devil, break all those bonds asunder. God will have a time to make inquisition
for perjury, when his roll of curses ten yards long, and five yards broad,
shall rest in the house of him that forsweareth himself, and destroy it, Zach.
5. 2.

But the words may be considered as a limitation; Keep the Kings command; but
so, that thou do not violate thine Oath and obedience due to God. Thy fealty to
the Gods must be such as will consist with thy fidelity to God; for we are
bound to God and his service by Oath and Covenant, 1 Pet. 3. 21. Psalm. 119.
106. And no subordinate obedience must make us forget our obedience to him who
is Supreme. We must obey Rulers usque ad aras, as far as Religion will suffer
us, and no farther. My obedience to man must be regulated by a good conscience
toward God, Dan. 3. 16, 17, 18. 1 Samuel 22. 17. Act. 5. 29. As a subordinate
Officer is not to be obeyed when he uses his power against his Prince, which
he received from his Prince, and should have improved for his Prince: So
neither is a Prince to be obeyed when he uses his power against God, which he
received from God, and should have improved for God. As we must give unto
Caesar the things that are Caesar's, so we must give unto God the things that
are Gods, Matthew. 22. 21, 22. (...)
One observes that the Greek Article is twice repeated when be speaks of
God, more then when he speaks of Caesar, to show that our special care should
be to give God his due. To pay to the King that tribure which is due to God
only, is not tributum Caesaris, sed servitium Diaboli. Chrysostom.
It was a noble speech of those Worthies (mentioned, Dan. 3. 16, 17, 18. who
were commanded by the King to worship the Image which he had set up) O
Nebuchadnezar we are not careful to answer thee in this matter. Our God whom we
serve is able to deliver us from the ^urning fiery furnace, and he will deliver
us out of thine hand, O King. But if not, be it known unto thee O King, that we
will not worship thy God, nor fall down to the golden Image which thou have set
up. Hist. G^ll.
And it was a gallant answer of the Prince of Condee, who being taken Prisoner
by Charles the ninth of France, and put to his choice, Whether he would go to
Mass, or be put to death, or suffer perpetual imprisonment? The former (said
he) by Gods grace I will never do; and for the two latter let the King do with
me what he pleases; God I hope, will turn all to the best.

We are also to honor Magistrates both by praying for them, and paying tribute
to them; the former is our duty, and the latter is their due; I will, says the
Apostle, that prayers and supplications be made for all men, for Kings, and all
in authority, 1 Timothy 2. 1, 2. The burden which lies on them is weighty, we had
need therefore to beg of God to strengthen their backs, otherwise they can
never bear it. Moses was a pious patient man, yet he tells us notwithstanding
all his strength of grace, Non possum portare, I am not able to bear all this
people. Numb. 11. 14.
There is a truth in that saying, Did men but know the weight of a Crown, they
would not stoop to take it up. Pride indeed is so prevalent with many persons,
that they will venture their lives to satisfy their ambition; these men's great
care is to get the Sword, the Scepter, not how to use them for God and his
people; but certainly they who mind a faithful discharge of their trusts, find
the Magistrates Throne to be a place of little ease. They are shepherds, Isai.
44. 28. and we know the life of a shepherd is a laborious life, they endure the
scorching heat of Summer, and the nipping ^old of the Winter to keep their
flocks safe. Cares and Fears about public concernments molest them night and
day, as weights hang on a clock, and will ^ot suffer them to sleep. If they
watch to protect us, should not we watch unto prayer for them? B. Halls
contemplation.
The e^bleme of King Henry the seventh in all the windows of his house was
still a Crown in a bush of thorns; surely to tell us that great places are not
free from great cares; that no man knows the weight of a Scepter, but he that
swayeth it.

We are bound likewise to pay tribute to them ^s well as pray for them; (...)
capitat^o, Poll money which men pay by the poll, or according to their estates;
(...), vectigal, due for merchandise. Beza.
Render to all their dues, tribute to whom tribute belongs, custom to whom
custom, Romans 13. 7.

It is observable, The Holy Ghost calls it their due. To pay tribute or
custom is not an act of courtesy, but a duty which must be done out of
conscience; God commands it from us in lieu of the Magistrates care of us;
Pompcy first converted the capitation or head silver to the City of Rome. Par.
in Romans
as v. 6. For this cause pay ye tribute (praestatis, n^n datis, you pay; not,
you give) for they are Gods Ministers, etc. Your paying tribute and custom, is
a sign of your subjection to them, and a thankful acknowledgement of your
protection from them, and v. 5. For this cause ought you to be subject, not
only for wrath, but for conscience sake. God takes care for the maintenance of
the Magistrate as well as of the Minister, and does strictly enjoin us, that
both they who watch for our souls, and they which watch for our bodies should
have an honorable subsistence. Did such as are private, but seriously consider
this word conscience (for conscience sake) they durst not as they do, cozen the
public. The same mighty Possessor of Heaven and Earth, who gives me a right
to the whole, gives them a right to a part of my estate, and therefore to
cozen them of their dues in tribute or custom, is to cozen and defile my
conscience by the violation of Gods righteous command. Tiberius did not approve
that shepherd that flayed his sheep instead of clipping; Nor T^lly him who cut
the wings, so that they could never grow after. Magistrates are set for the
good of the people; and therefore should be moderate in demanding their goods.
.

I shall in the next place lay down two or three thoughts to enforce the duty
of honoring Magistrates.

First, Consider the necessity of Magistracy; without Magistracy one man would
be but bread for another; and the world which is like the Sea for storms and
tempests, would also resemble it in this, that the Inhabitants of it would be
as the fishes of the Sea, the great would devour the small. Men are like the
fishes of the Sea (says the Prophet) that have no ruler over them, Hab. 1. 14.
No man could call any thing his own, were it not for these Gods. Did not they
defend us by their power, every one would rob and wrong us at his pleasure. Our
liberties, estates and lives would quickly be a prey to the covetousness and
cruelty of vicious persons. Liberty and property are quite banish'^ where
authority is not established. Who can express the malice, and murders, the
rapine and robberies, the mischie^s and miseries that reign where the
Magistrate does not reign. In those days there was no King in Israel, every man
did that which was right (not in Gods, but) in his own eyes, Judge. 17. 6. Judge.
19. 1. And what evil is not good in his eye who has the Devil for his guide
and leader, and corrupt nature for his law and rules? When the gate of
Magistracy is shut, the floodgates for all manner of enormities are open. When
these that bear up the pillars of the house are removed, how soon will the
building be ruined? When God intended the destruction of the Jewish
Commonwealth, he took away their Sanedrim. And in the glass of our times it is
too too visible what a sad desormed face things have, when Magistrates are
overturned. Constantinople will witness to this truth, where upon the grand
Signiors death, till his Successor be on his Throne, all things are in a
confusion, and the Janissaries have the rule and Dominion. Some write that the
Persian law commands, that upon the decease of their Kings, there should be a
susspension of the Laws for certain (five) days that Subjects might know the
necessity of Government, and learn to value it more by being berest of the
benefit of it for a time. Nay when God is exceedingly provoked by sin, how
sharply does he make men suffer by taking away their stay and their staff. The
mighty man, the Judge, the Prophet and the Prudent, Isa. 3. 1, 2, 3, 4. The
taking away the civil stay and staff, the Prince; and the spiritual stay and
staff, the Prophet, will quickly cause the fall, yea the utter downfall of the
people. Men often murmur at the Magistrate, and tell us (many times falsely) He
is a Tyrant, if he were gone all wonld be well; but when he is out of the way,
do they not find many Tyran^s for one? Every man would be an oppressor, were
there no man to be a restrainer.

What would a Nation without government be but a desert of savage beasts? what
would Towns be but dens of Thieves, and what would families be but stages of
unclean birds? yea what would most men be, but like dogs trying all right and
title by their teeth and strength?

Men naturally are more afraid of the noise of the Musket then of the Bullet; I
mean of the frowns of the Rulers, then of the fire of Hell: and therefore were
they once free from them, they would do that which would soon undo boch
themselves and others.

Now the necessity of Magistrates calls for reverence and obedience to their
authority. The more needful things are, the more grateful they should, be.
Things that are superfluous may be slighted, things that are only convenient
may be the less valued: but things that are absolutely necessary must be highly
esteemed. I tell thee, the Ministry is not more necessary to the well-being of
the Church, then the Magistracy to the well-being of the State. You may as soon
see a Tree thrive without a root, as a Commonwealth flourish without a Ruler.
Magistrates are in Scripture called the heads of the people, Exodus 18. 25.
because they are as necessary to the body Politic, to direct and govern it, as
the head is to the body natural; therefore as the members yield respect and are
subject unto the head (if the head do but ache, all the humors of the arm (as
some observe) run to the head, and therefore the arms are thin and slender,
because they want their proper nurture; yea if the head be in danger how do the
other parts hazard themselves for its shelter? many an hand and arm has been
wounded, that the head might be saved) thus should subjects show their respect
to, and tenderness of their superiors, for if a member or some of the
inferior parts be cut off, the body may live; but if the head be taken off, if
Governors be set aside, Actum est de republica, that Kingdom, that
Commonwealth cannot stand long.

Secondly, Consider the severity of God against the contemners of Magistrates.
There are several in the word of God that stand up like the Mast of a Ship cast
away by Sands, to warn us that we steer not their course, least we be sunk
also. Those who opposed the preservers of our civil lives, have not seldom been
punished with violent deaths: Corah and his company, Abimelech, Athaliah,
Adonijah, Absalom, Zimri, Ioab, Sheba, with several others will confirm this
truth. And humane as well as divine writings speak to the same purpose.

James the first King of Scots was murdered in Speed Chron.
Perth by Walter Earl of Athol, in hope to attain the Crown: for so had his
Sorcerers prophesied, and crowned he was with a Crown of red hot Iron clapped
upon his head, being one of the tortures wherewith he ended at once his wicked
days and desires. Becket, Mortimer, Tyler, Warbeck, Sanders, Story, Campian,
the Piercies, the Powder-Plotters, Rhodulphus Duke of Suevia, Richard the third
of England, and mauy others have been marked with divine vengeance for
contemning this divine Ordinance.

My Son, says Solomon, fear thou the Lord and the King, and meddle not with
them that are given to change. For their calamity shall arise suddenly, and who
knows the ruin of them both? Prove. 21. 22. i. e. of them that fear not God,
and of them that fear not the King. And Eccles. 10. 8, 9. He that diggeth a
pit, shall fall into it; and whosoever breaks an hedge, a Serpent shall bite him.
Whosoever removes stones, shall be hurt therewith; and he that cleaves wood,
shall be endangered thereby. These four proverbial expressions speak the danger
of them that go about to supplant their Rulers. Whilst they are digging pits
to catch others, the earth falls on them, and murdereth themselves. When they
are breaking up the old hedge of Government, Serpents and Adders which use to
harbor in old walls and hedges will sting them. God will make men know that it
is a dangerous thing to confound rule and subjection, and to break down the
partition wall which he has set up between Magistrates and people. When these
sharp instruments which they run against, wound them deep, they will believe
that it is bad meddling with edged tools; and that there is a truth in those
words of the Apostle, They that resist procure to themselves damnation, Romans
13. 2. that is, both corporal punishment and eternal torment, says Peter
Martyr.

If thou would not therefore suffer with others, take heed of sinning with
others. Depart I pray you from the Tents of these wicked persons, (says Moses
to the Congregation upon the conspiracy of Corah, Dathan, etc. against their
rulers) and touch nothing of theirs, leaft ye be consumed in all their sins,
Numb. 16. 26. They that join in common rebellions, must expect to be joined in
common destructions. Be not imparient of rule, as thou desire to avoid that
ruin, which Gods mouth does threaten, and his hand will execute on such
rebellious ones. Let those many examples (which are in Scripture and other
Authors mentioned) of them that are hung on Gibbets as monuments of Gods sury,
fright thee from their acts least thou partake of their ends. Believe it, no
King can possibly be so tender of his own honor, as God is of his own
Officers. Do not therefore shoot-off thy guns of opposition against the Gods,
least they reco^ and kill thy self. Reviling of natural parents was banishment
by Plato's Law, death by Gods Law, Exodus 21. 17. Those then that revile civil
parents, shall not always go unpunished.

Thirdly, Martial Policy, true Religion, and civil Justice, are the three
Pillars which uphold all, says Sr. Walter Rawlcigh.
Consider, thy felicity and welfare does under God depend much on the Gods. The
Apostle enforces this use by this very Argument. For he is the Minister of God
for thy good, Romans 13. If he labor to do thee good why should thou imagine
evil against him? To render (...) for (...) is God-like, Mat. 5. ult. but to
render evil for good, is devilish.

Magistrates are shields, Psalm. 47. 9. they defend their subjects from the
darts and bullets with which the sons of violence would wound them.

Shepherds, Numb. 27. 17. to defend them from the devouring mouths of ravenous
creatures. They are called the foundations of the earth, because they support
the building from ruin, and sinking, Prove. 10. 25. (...) quasi (...).
Coverings, Ezekiel. 28. 16. which imports that Engine, under which Soldiers
used to be protected in assaulting the walls of an enemy against the stones and
darts which were thrown down upon them. Guides, Prove. 6. 7. because they lead
and direct the people. Angels, 2 Samuel 14, 15. in that they defend and protect
the people. (...) medel. ^.
The Fathers and Mothers of the Country. Gen, 41. 43. Judges 5. 7. because
they take care of, and provide for their people. Healers, Job 34. 17. because
they cure their wounds, and make up their breaches. They deliver the poor that
cries, and the fatherless, and him that has none to help. They are eyes to
the blind, and feet to the lame, Fathers to the poor, and helpers to the needy,
Non sibi sed multorum utilititati se esse natum.
Job 29. 11, 15. They are born not for themselves, but for the good of many, as
Bucers Physician told him. And they govern not seeking their own wealth, but
the Commonwealth, as Aelius Adrianus Emperor of Rome would say. Non mihi sed
populo, signifying that which he was often heard to say, Ita se rempublicam
ge^turum, ut sciret rem populi esse, non suam.
They are as Trees whose leaves are fair, whose fruit much, and in them is meat
for all; in their shadow the beasts of the field dwell, and in them the fowls
of the heaven have their habitation, Dan. 4. 12. 21.

They are the keepers of our liberties, the preservers of our lives, the safety
of our persons, the security of our possessions, the terrors of sinners, the
defense of Saints, the Nerves and Sinews, yea the Vital spirits of the body
Politic, without whom all things would run to ruin, and quickly fall to
confusion. How much then do they for us, and how much then should we be subject
to them! Surely as little as many value them, they will find much cause to
celebrate the funerals of these civil Fathers with many tears. Our comforts as
well as our consciences call upon us to be subject. To wish them harm that
watch to be our helps, is horrid ingratitude. Cicero says, he that kills his
Father commits many sins in one, because he sins against many
obligations. His Father begat him, nourished him, brought him up. Magistrates
are the Fathers of their Country; he that resists them, or does violence to
them, commits several sins in one, because he sins against so many
engagements to subjection. We owe all the comforts we enjoy for this world nay
somewhat of them that relate to a better world under God to the Magistrate. We
could not sleep quie^ly in our beds one night; we could not eat one meal
peaceably in the day without them, we could not call either children, or
estates, or lives our own without them: we could not enjoy such liberties for
our souls, such frequent communion of Saints without them. How great then is
our obligation, and how great should our subjection be to them! These many
cords of kindness should bind us to them. He was possessed with a Devil whom no
cords would hold, Mark 5. 3. and surely they are little better that against the
Law of God and this protecting love of the Gods will not learn to be loyal.

Trees receive moisture from the earth, and within a while pay it back in those
leaves that fall to the earth again: the Rivers receive their waters from the
Ocean, and they acknowledge it in emptying themselves into it: Sheep that are
fed by us acknowledge it in serving us with their flesh and fleeces. And shall
man be more brutish then the beast? I s^all end this exhortation with the words
of the Holy Ghost a little varied; Obey them that have the rule ^ver you, and
submit your selves; for they watch for your bodies (as Ministers for your soul)
as they that must give an account, Heb. 13. 17.

My second Exhortation will be to the Gods. If the God of heaven have appointed
you to be Gods on earth, then it may exhort you to walk as Gods, and to work as
Gods amongst men.

First, Walk as Gods among men; your calling is high, and therefore your
carriage should be holy. Every calling has a peculiar comeliness belonging to
it. A Courtier has another manner of behavior then a Country man, a Scholar
then a Scullion, a Prince then a Peasant. The greater your privileges are, the
more gracious your practices should be. Remember whose livery your wear, whose
image you bear, whose person you represent, whose place you stand in, and walk
worthy of that calling whereunto you are called, Ephesians. 4. 1. Some would have us
give no names to children, but such as should mind them of their duty. The
spirit of God has given you a divine name which should mind you of the divine
nature. Since your compellations are according to God, surely your
conversations should be according to the Gospel.

The several Titles given to you, call for sanctity and strictness from you.

The spirit of God calls you Kings, 1 Samuel 8. 9. and Princes, Josh. 8. 33.
Now is it seemly or suitable, to see Kings or Princes padling in the mire, or
playing in the dirt with every beggars brat? Does not every one expect that
their Linen should be in print, their clothes clean without the least spot of
dirt? And is it comely or consonant to see Magistrates (honored with a
commission from heaven) wallowing in the mire of sin and pollution with every
heir of hell? Do not all expect that as your places are god-like and
honorable, so your practice should be godly and answerable, that your linen
should be white, your garments undefiled, and your persons higher then others
not only in place but piety?

When King Porus was taken prisoner, and demanded by the Conqueror how he
would be used? he answered, Like a King: and being three times asked the same
question, he as often returned the same answer. And if you ask me how you
should demean your selves, I would answer Like Kings, Every one resembling the
behavior of a King. Prove. 31, 3, 4. It is not for Kings, O Lemuel, it is not
for Kings to drink wine, Of ^onosus the Empero^r it was said, He was born non
ut vivat, sed ut bibat. And when being overcome by Probus, he hanged himself it
was commonly jested, That a tankard hung there, not a man.
nor Princes strong drink, least they drink and forget the Law. Give not thy
strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which destroys Kings. Drunkenness
and Uncleanness are sinful and unwarrantable in Subjects, but they are most
sordid and a bominable in a Sovereign. They are so much worsethen others, by
how much they ought to be better then others. A disease that surprizeth the
head or heart, is more dangerous then those that infect the exterior members:
A spot in silk is far worse then one in sackcloth. A Fly in a barrel of pitch
does not the harm which it does in a box of Ointments.

When Scipio was offered an Harlot, he said, Vellem si non essem Imperator, I
would if I were not a General, an Emperor. Should such a man as I fly! said
Nehemiah. So should a Ruler consider, Should such a man as I be unclean! I that
punish such sin in others, should I commit it my self! Should such a man as I
swear, be lascivious in my language, or unsavory in my speeches! A divine
sentence is in the mouth of a King, Prove. 16. 10. I whose words are Laws and
Oracles, should speak as the Oracles of God, 1 Pet. 4. 11. Should such a man as
I profane the Sabbath, associate with sinners, be prayerless in my family, or
venture upon any iniquity! It is an abomination for Kings to commit wickedness,
Id^o deteriores sumus quia meliores esse debemus. Salv.
Prove. 16. 12. Peter Martyr told Queen Elizabeth, that Princes were doubly
bound to God, as Men, and as Princes or chief men. Their sins are sins against
more obligations, and therefore are sins of more aggravations then others. A
great man cannot commit a small sin; yet a great man is seldom a good man.
Godliness in a Ruler is like a Diamond in a golden Ring, which shines
radiantly; but there are few Jewels so set. Among all the Kings of Israel, not
one godly man: Among the Kings of Judah very few. Pope urban wrote to a Prelate
in his time scoffingly, Monacho fervido, Abbati calido, Episcopo tepido and
Archiepiscopo frigido; still the higher in means, the worse in manners.
Men in high places are apt to have their heads giddy, and thereby are in great
danger of falling. Of one only Roman Emperor (Titus) it is said that he was
the better for his honor; most are worse.

The Spirit of God calls you the children of God, And all of you are children
of the most High. Now how exactly, how circumspectly should the children of God
walk! Much obedience may be expected from servants, but more from sons; their
pre-eminence is more, and therefore their obedience should be more. The fathers
of the ^lesh look for much dutifulness from their children; but surely the
Father of Spirits may look for more from his children. Phil. 2. 15. That ye may
be blameless and harmless, the sons of God without reb^ke in the midst of a
crooked and perverse generation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world. Ye
that are Gods sons, are appointed to blame others that do evil, and therefore
it behooves you to be blameless your selves; Qui alterum accusat probri, etc.
but blameless and harmless, the sons of God without rebuke. The sons of great
men should be without riotousness or rebellion; but the sons of God should be
without suspicion or rebuke; that is, walk so strictly, as that they should do
nothing blameworthy. If God be your Father, where is his honor? Mal. 1. 6. Do
you honor him in your hearts by giving him your superlative love, and fear,
and trust, and esteem? Do you honor him in your houses, by causing all within
your charges to worship him according to his Word? Are your houses houses of
holiness? praying, reading, singing, catechizing houses? are they examples of
Religion to your neighbors? Is holiness to the Lord written upon your selves,
your children, your servants, your estates, and upon all that belong to you? Do
you honor God in your lives by walking as he walked? Are ye followers of him
as dear children? Ephesians. 5. 1. Do you resemble him as children their Father?
Are you holy as he was holy in all manner of conversation? Was your everlasting
Father (when he walked in your flesh upon earth) ever guilty of c^rsing, or
swearing, or lying? Did any rotten communication ever drivel out of his lips?
Was he ever guilty of oppressing the poor, or despising the needy? of seeking
himself, or of doing his own will? Did he ever neglect praying, and instructing
his Family of the Apostles, or supplication by himself? Was not he at prayer
early in the morning a great while before day, and was not he up at it all
night? Was it not his meat and drink to do the will of his Father, and to
finish his work? Did not he go about doing good, glorifying God upon Earth, and
doing what was well pleasing in his sight? Surely ye that are the sons of God
by (...) and office, should resemble the Son of God by nature.

O Sirs, Think of it; ye that are the sons of God by deputation, should
resemble this Son of God by generation. Be not as Eli's, and Samuel's, and
David's children, Eus^b.
a disgrace to your Father: But as Constantines sons resembled their Father in
his good parts and practices, so be ye perfect as your Father in heaven is
perfect, Mat. 5. ult. David's daughters were known to be his children by their
garments, 2 Samuel 13. 18. Do you make it known to others that you are the
children of God, by not defiling your garments; by keeping your selves
unspotted from the world; by looking to your cloath^s that they be not defiled,
though ye walk in dirty streets; be as the children of God, without rebuke in
the midst of a crooked and perverse generation.

Consider, the Devil is ever watching for your halting, and like some unkind
servant, he blabs presently to the Father what a dirty pickle his children are
in. Suppose he sees the dirt of drunkenness, of uncleanness, of squeezing
tenants, of profaning the Sabbath, of scoffing at godliness, of irreligion and
atheism in your houses, and immediately carries your clothes to God, as the
Patriarchs did Ioseths coat (For he accuses men before God day and night,
Revel. 12. 10.) Saying, Lord, is this thy sons coat? Know now whether it be thy
sons coat or no. Genesis 37. 32. Do thy children use to carry themselves as my
children! Surely these are of their father the Devil. Can you imagine that God
should own you? No certainly, (as the Pope disowned the Bishop, when the
Emperor had sent the Buffe-coat in which he was taken prisoner, and deliver^d
him up to justice) he will not dishonor himself by owning you. Nay, how can
you expect but that Jesus Christ, who sits by, and hears the indictment
against you (who uses to appear as an Advocate for others, when the Accuser of
the Brethren pleads against them) should even second the Bill against you,
and say to God, as Moses, Deuteronomy. 32. 5. They have corrupted themselves, their
spot is not the spot of Gods children, they are perverse and crooked persons!
Father, these are sins not of weakness but wickedness; they are not
infirmities, but enormities; they are not the spots of thy children. Those that
cast thee out of their hearts, and let the flesh have the Supremacy there; that
cast thee out of their houses, and let the world have the Superiority there;
Those that make no conscience of thy day and their duties; whose whole care is
to be honored and enriched; whose heat and fervor is for credit and profit,
and put thee off with a few fragments of time, and a few scraps of their
estate, which they can spare from the world and flesh; those sin like wretches,
like rebels, not like Saints, like sons; Their spots are not the spots of thy
children.

There are spots which may be, and spots which cannot be the spots of Gods
children. All sins are unsuitable to, but some sins are inconsistent with
sonship; yea the pre-eminence of Adoption does absolutely deny the predominancy
of any corruption.

When Antigonus was to go to a place that might probably prove a temptation to
sin, he asked counsel of Menedemus what he should do; He bade him only remember
he was a Kings son: So say I to you, that walk every day in the midst of many
snares of temptations (and therefore should have the greater care and
circumspection) Remember that ye are the sons of the King of Kings, and do
nothing unworthy of the name by which he calls you, or the place to which he
has called you.

It might have been a cutting word to the heart of Brutus, (whose hand was then
stabbing Caesar) What thou my son Brutus! I could not have expected better from
a slave; but little looked for this from a son. How think you, can the Lord
take it, that you who are his children, should wound the Body of his Son with
oaths and curses, his sacred laws by wickedness and wilful disobedience! I
beseech you, be exceeding holy that ye may show your selves to be children of
the most High. In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of
the Devil; He that does not righteonsness, is not of God, I John 3. 10. If ye
therefore call on the Father, who without respect of persons will judge every
man according to his works, pass the time of your sojurning here in fear, 1
Pet. 1. 17. forasmuch as ye know ye were not redeemed with corruptible things,
as silver or gold, from your vain conversations received by tradition from your
fathers; but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a Lamb without spot and
blemish, verse. 18, 19. It is written of Boleslaus, one of the Kings of Poland,
that he still carried about with him the picture of his Father, and when he was
to do any great work, he would look on the picture, and pray that he might do
nothing unworthy of such a Fathers name: So when you set about any business,
desire and labor that you may do nothing (while on earth) unworthy your Father
who is in heaven.

Nay further, the Holy Ghost calls you Gods. How godly then should you be!
how unsuitable are the works of the Devil to them that have the name of God! God
is light, and in him is no darkness at all; and should not the Gods shine
brightly with the light of holiness, and abhor all deeds of darkness? The Gods
of the Heathen were taxed with several crimes; Jupiter with uncleanness, Juno
with passion, etc. Hence says Austin, the Heathen took liberty to sin, because
their Gods were represented to them as patterns or approvers of such actions:
As Charaea in Terence, Non ego facerem quae Jupiter fecit? Should I be backward
to what the God himself was forward? But the God of Heaven is far from such
things; He is the holy One of Israel, holy in all his ways, and righteous in
all his works; His Nature is the pattern of holiness; his Law is the rule of
holiness: Holiness is his Essence, his glory, himself, Psalm. 89. 13. A God of
truth without jniquity, just and right is he, Deuteronomy. 32. 4. There are many spots
in our Moons; but not the least spot in this Sun of Righteousness. Now
therefore you that have his Name, should get his Nature, and be pure as he is
pure: The Name of God is an honor to yon, O be not you a dishonor to it,
James 2. 8. Do not, O do not blaspheme that worthy name by which ye are called.
How holy should you be in your hearts; how watchful over your words; how wary
in your works; how faithful in your families; how conscientious in all
companies? for the most High has said, Ye are Gods Lactantus tells us that
the very Heathen thought that their only way to honor their Gods was to be
like them, to do as they did.
.

Alexander having a soldier of his name that was a coward, bid him either
learn to be valiant, or be no more called Alexander: So say I to you that have
the Livery and Name of God, and do the drudgery of Satan; either learn to be
holy, to be good, or be no more called Gods.

Sir, observe it, is it comely for a God to swear; for a God to wrong his
neighbors; for a God to profane Gods day; for a God to despise godliness, and
godly men; for a God to keep company with those that are of their father the
Devil; for a God to live without God in his affections, house, and
conversation! Blush O guilty Justice, or Ruler, and be ashamed, and either
amend thy life and nature, or disown this name of God.

I have sometime read of Luther, that he used to repel the darts of temptations
with this shield, I am a Christian. I cannot do it: O would you but think when
your hearts, or lives are swerving from God, I am called a God, and cannot, may
not do the work of the Devil. I may not do any thing unworthy the name of God,
it might be helpful to you against the assaults of Hell.

Besides, Nemo errat sivi ipsi, sed dementiam spargit in proximos. Sen. Ep. 94.
you had the more need to walk in the way of Gods Commandments, because you
have many following your steps: They that have many at their heels, had need to
be holy, least they cause the souls of others as well as their own to miscarry
for ever. Sin (especially in great men) is like leven which soureth the whole
lump, 1 Cor. 5. 6.

The bodies of men do not sooner take infection then their souls. If the great
trees fall, they usually brush and beat down smaller ones with them. When two
or three men of renown, famous in the Congregation, begin a mutiny against God
they shall not want company to ioyn with them, Numb. 16. If the Princes of the
people be guilty of Rebellion, ^how soon is the whole Congregation in the same
transgression? Numb. 13. 28, 29. Numb. 14. init. When a disease has once taken
the head, how often does it thence diffuse it self into other parts of the
body? When Charles the fifth went into Italy to be Crowned The whole Army of
soldiers will follow their Leader.
Emperor, being troubled with the Headache, he cut his hair short, the great
Courtiers followed his example; so as long hair so much in fashion before, grew
quite out of fashion in his time, Strabo. Alexander used to carry his head on
one side, Hisp. Exem.
whereupon his Courtlers to imitate him did the like. Before Vespasians time
the Romans were grown to great excess in clothes and furniture for their
houses; and though many laws were made against it, they could not be restra^ed:
but when he came to the Crown, being a temperate and moderate Prince, all their
former vanity grew out of use. So true is that saying of King Alphonsus, That
as certain flowers move after the Sun, so the people follow the manners of
their Princes: And certain it is, that the common sort, like a flock of sheep,
which way the first goes, all the rest follow. The actions of Rulers are often
the rulers of the peoples actions. The vulgar are like soft wax, taking any and
easy impression from the seals of great men. When men of q^ality sweat, roar,
deride Religion, dwell without God in their houses, etc. how quickly do their
neighbors take after them, and justify their practices by such patterns,
thinking they sin cum privilegio, if they sin cum Principe! But now, if a great
man walk with God, condemn and reprove sin by his works as well as by words,
(being as the chief Magistrate of Israel was, mighty in word and deed, Act. 7.
22.) if he pray with his family, keep the Lords day strictly, work out his
salvation diligently, how prevalent will such an example be to the inferior
people! surely as when the Mountains overflow with water, the valleys are much
the better; so when these Mountains (as Rulers are called, Micah 6. 7.)
overflow with the water of grace, the plains will abound the more in fruit.

Think therefore how comfortable it will be for thee by thy holy life to direct
others in the way to heaven; and how lamentable will it one day be to thee,
should thou lead others in the road to Hell? How deep will thou sink into
hell, that shall be pressed down under the weight of thy own and thine other
men's sins? Hain. in vit. Lutheri.
I remember Luther mentions this to be one of the Papists tenants, That if
the Pope be so neglectful of his own and his Brethrens salvation, and so
unprofitable and remiss in his place, that he carries a long with himself
innumerable people to be eternally tormented, no mor^al man ought to reprove
him for this sin. But sure I am, the Immortal God will reprove both him and you
for such crimes, when ye shall meet in the other world, where the weight of sin
will be sufficiently felt, and the worth of the soul (which is destroyed by it)
shall be fully known.

Further, It behooves you the rather to walk as Gods, because others do not
only sin with you, but suffer for you. When King David numbered the people out
of pride, how did God number the people to the Pestilence! 2 Samuel What bitter
fruits does God make Israel to feed on, Ier. 15. 2. Such as are for death to
death, such as are for famine to famine, such as are for the sword to the
sword! But if you would know the root from which those sour fruits spring,
Because of Manasseh the King of Judah, for that which he did in Jerusalem, v. 4.

Whether, says one, a Gangreen begin at the head or the heel, it will kill;
but a Gangreen in the head will kill sooner then one in the heel; Even so will
the sins of great ones overthrow a state sooner then the sins of small ones;
therefore the advice of Sigismund the Emperor, when a motion was made for
Reformation, was, Let us begin at the Minorities, says one; No, rather says
he, Let us begin at the Majorities; for if the great ones be good, the meaner
cannot easily be evil.

Secondly, It exhorts you to work as Gods.

I shall branch this Use into three Partic^lars.

1. Execute Justice impartially. 2. Excel in showing Mercy. 3. Promote Piety
to the utmost of your power.
First, Execute justice impartially. God is a God of Justice and judgment,
Isa. 30. 18. The most just, Job 34. 17. Others may do justly, he cannot but do
justly: Justice which is an accident in others (and therefore may be separated
from them) is his very Essence, his Being. Be ye therefore like God. Let
Justice run down like water, and Righteousness like a mighty stream. Wear the
same garments which he does, Isa. 59. 17. He puts on Righteousness for a
Breastplate, and the Helmet of Salvation upon his head. Such garments did holy
Job wear, I put on Righteousness, and it clothed me, my Judgment was as a
Robe and a Diadem, Job 29. 14. Kings and Princes wear Crowns and Diadems,
Judges and other Officers wear Robes and other Ornaments. Now says Job, others
place much of their glory and state in their Robes, in their Purple vestments
which strike a reverence in the Subject toward his Superior, adding in the
estimation of men Majesty to the person, and solemnity to the action of the
wearer: but I place my honor in Justice and Judgment; I think my self better
clothed with these real virtues, then others with their empty marks and
ensigns of dignity.

I say, It was a strange yet true saying, There was more justice in hell then
in France; there the guilty are punished, be they never so great, they do not
escape; but in France it is otherwise; may it not be said so of England?
Execute Justice impartially, that is, without fear or favor; Ye shall do no
unrighteousness in judgment; thou shall not respect the person of the poor,
nor honor the person of the mighty, Lev. 19. 15. as if he had said, ye cannot
deal righteously, if ye spare any, because he is poor, or because he is rich.
It is a principle in Moral Policy, That an ill executor of the Laws is worse in
a State then a great breaker of them. And the Egyptian Kings presented the Oath
to their Judges, not to swerve from their consciences, though they received a
command from themselves to the contrary. Neither fear of greatness (It is a
mercy to have Judges, says Cicero, modo audeant quae sentiunt) nor favor of
nearness should make Magistrates deviate from the Rule. When Caricles the son
in law of Phocion was accused for taking bribes, he desired his Father to
defend his cause; but he answered him, I took thee for my son in law in all
honest matters only. A Magistrate should be an heart without affection; an eye
without lust; a mind without passion; or otherwise his hand will do unrighteous
actions. He that goes to the Seat of Judicature, must leave his affections (as
Abram his servants when he went to the Mount) behind him. A Justice must like
the earth, cherish and nourish the low Violet as well as the tall Cedar. The
Graecians placed Justice betwixt Leo and Libra, thereby signifying, that there
ought to be both magnanimity in executing, and indifferency in determining. But
the impartiality of a Ruler is notably set out by the Throne of the house of
David, which was placed in the gate of the City, Psalm. 122. 5.
toward the Sun rising, as some observe. In the gate, to tell us that all who
went in and came out at the gate, might indifferently be heard, and have free
access to the Judgment Seat; but rowards the rising of the Sun, to show that
their judgment should be as clear from corruption, as the Sun is clear in his
chiefest brightness.

It would be an ornament unto, and tend to the settlement of Magistracy ( for
the Throne is established by righteousness, Prove. 16. 12.) if those two Verses
which some say are written in letters of gold over the Tribunal in Zant, were
practiced by every Court of Justice.

Hic locus odit, amat, punit, conservat, honor at,
Nequitiam, pacem, crimina, jura, bonos.
In the executing of Justice there are two things mainly to be minded.

1. That you be terrors to evil doers; this is expressed as one of your chief
duties, Romans 13. 3. If men be fearless in sinning, surely you should not be
fearful in sentencing them for their sins. God hates iniquity; He is of purer
eyes then to behold it, the evil of sin never got a good look from God, and
why should it from the Gods? Dan. Hist.
Edward the Confessor was held a bad Prince, not by doing but enduring evil.
God was angry with Eli, and tells him that he would judge his house for ever
for the iniquity which he knew, because his Sons made themselves vile, and he
restrained them not, 1 Samuel 3. 13. Eli was a Magistrate, and should have put
forth his authority and punished those ungodly children, but because he did
not, God punished both him and them. O it is dangerous to do the work of the
Lord negligently. Sir, Do not you (or might you not upon inquiry) know of them
that profane Gods day, blaspheme his name, frequent Alehouses and the like?
do you restrain them? Do you fright such offenders with your frowns, and show
your love to their souls by executing Justice on them for their sins? If you do
not, look to your self; for God has Iron hands for Justices that have leaden
heels, and will one day strike them home, for forswearing themselves to spare
others. He will be a terror to thee, and make thee a terror to thy self who
wilt not at his command be a terror to evil doers. Thou sinnest in others, Our
old word Koning and by contraction King, comes of Con, says Becanus, and
comprehends 3. things, Possum, ^Scio, Audeo.
whilst thou suffer them to sin, and thou shall one day suffer with them,
Rev. 18. 4. Thou art afraid to offend thy Neighbors, I tell thee, God will
make thee know twere better offending all the world, then one God. I beseech
you, make it appear that you are Magistrates by being men of courage; be as
bold in executing as others are in transgressing the law. Shall iniquity be
brazenfaced, and authority hide it self? If the offender be in robes, be not
afraid of him, but make him afraid of you. I have read that the Athenian
Judges sat in Mars-street, to show that Rulers should be men of valor; Cowards
are more fit to be slaves then rulers. A Magistrate should be like Moses, in
his own cause as meek as a Lamb, in Gods cause as stiff as an Oak, as bold as a
Lion. All dare disparage him who dares discourage none. How punctually does
Scripture tell you, that this ought to be your practice! Magistrates, says
Peter, are sent for the punishment of evil doers, 1 Pet. 2. 14. And Paul says,
If thou do evil, be afraid; for he bears not the sword in vain. For he is
the Minister of God, an avenger to execute wrath on them that doevil, Romans 13.
4. The sword which is carried before him, as an Ensign of his power, is not for
show or for fashion, but for the wounding disorderly persons. A wise King says
Solomon, Prove. 20. 26. scatters the wicked and brings the wheel over them,
a kind of punishment then in use, and now in many places. Especially be severe
to them that profane the Sabbath, that Queen of days, that golden season of
grace. Nehemiah would not spare the chief men that profaned this chiefest of
days, Nehem. 13. 17. This is one of the chief precepts which the Lord of
Sabbath commands you, Exodus 20. Exodus 23. 12. Englands disturbing Gods rest,
has raised God to disturb Englands rest.

He that spares the bad, hurts the good. The Surgeon must cut off
incurable members, and the Physician of the State must purge out the peccant
humors of the body Politic, least they infect and injure the whole. The
execution of Justice is like a clap of thunder which strikes few, but
frighteth many. Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware, Prove. 19. 25. P^na
ad unum, timor ad omnes.
Thus by not punishing the evil, both the good and bad are (though unjustly)
punished; yet the greatest injury is to the Ruler, by the offenders impunity;
for besides the guilt which he contracts on his soul, and thereby Gods eternal
wrath, he is oftentimes punished in his body, and made an example of Gods
Justice to others. When the French King was persuaded by the Duke of Sully,
Henry the fourth.
to banish that generation of Vipers, the Jesuits, he would not, saying, Give
me security then for my life. But he was shortly after stabbed to death by
their instigation. God does not seldom make them examples of his Judgments,
that will not make others examples of Justice.

Secondly, That you be Protectors of them that do well. The Holy Ghost tells
you that you should be for the praise of them that do well. Courts of Justice
should be Cities of refuge to them that are unjustly and causlesly pursued;
like Noah's Ark, to take in and give rest to those weary Doves; like the horns
of the Altar, to which innocence should fly for protection. Mineeyes says
David, shall be upon the faithful in the Land, Psalm. 101. 6. Hide the godly
especially under the shadow of your wings. Piety has too much been bespattered
with obloquy, and holiness suffered under the name of baseness. Mali esse
coguntur ne viles habeantur; Salvian,
Men have been necessitated to be vicious, lest they should be accounted vile.
Be you not only patterns, but Patrons of purity. Let the world know that
greatness can own and countenance goodness. The Kings of Gerar were called
Abimelech, which signifies My Father, Genesis 30. 2. noting that a King should be
as careful and mindful, as tender and chary of his Subjects (especially good
ones) as Fathers of their children. Alas, if the Magistrates will not own them,
what what shall the godly do! The Devil raises all the the Train-bands of hell
against them that march to heaven. The world loves its own, but because they
are not of the world, therefore the world hates them; their neighbors malign
them, and rage because they dare not run to the same excess of riot. The whole
Parish if occasion be, will be gathered together against those that are pious,
especially if they be zealous (for Gods glory) against others impieties. Now
since God has set you up for their shelter, surely you are concerned to secure
them in times of danger. Sure I am that it is a privilege and honor to you,
that you may be serviceable to the people of God. God carries them upon Eagles
wings, Exodus 19. 4. as tenderly as the Eagle her young ones, of which some
observe, she carries her prey between her Talons, but her young under her
wings; and if a Fowler shoot at her, she will first have her own body shot
through, before they shall be hurt. God is therefore called their shield, Genesis
17. 1. Now a shield is between the body and the weapon. Look therefore that you
imitate God in this. Remember that men were not made for you, but you were made
for them; God took David from the sheepfold to feed Jacob his people and Israel
his inheritance, Psalm. 78. 70, 71.

It was said by Nazianzen of Athanasius, that he was Magnes and Adamas: an
Adamant in his stout resolute carriage against vice, and a Lodestone to
encourage and draw virtue to him. And the wise man tells us, The Kings favor
is toward a wise servant, but his wrath is toward him that causes shame,
Prove. 14. ult. As the wind hurts not the reeds and corn which yield to it,
but rooteth up the sturdy stubborn Oak which will not bow; so the Ruler should
deal sharply with the obstinate, but gently with the mild and flexible.

Augustus Caesar in whose time Christ was born, was so tender of his people,
Sueton.
that when he died they wept saying, Would he had never been born, or never
died!

Secondly, As you should work like Gods amongst men in executing Justice
impartially, so likewese in showing mercy: God is the Father of mercies, 1 Cor.
1. 3. Rich in mercy, Ephesians. 2. 4. He has multitudes of tender mercies, Psalm.
51. 1. He is abundant in mercy, 1 Pet. 1. 3. His mercy is free, Romans 9. 15.
Great, Psalm. 57. 10. Matchless, Jer. 3. 1. Sure, Isa. 55. 1. Mr. Calamy on
Ezekiel. 36. 32. p 30. before the Parliament.
Mercy as one observes, is the chief of all Gods attributes, though in
themselves they are all equal; but in regard of our necessities, as Oil swims
above all other liquors, as the Eagle is the chief of Birds, the Lion of
Beasts, Gold of metals; so mercy is the chief of all Gods attributes. He has a
Mercy-seat, to note that he sits at ease when he is showing mercy. Whereas
judgment is his strange work, Isa. 28. 21. we read likewise that mercy
pleases him, Mica. 7. 18. Thus the Gods should be merciful men, your hearts
should be full of mercy, and pity to the sinner, when your hands are executing
justice against the sin.

The Be does not sting till provoked: God does not afflict willingly, nor
grieve the children of men, Lam. 3. 33. There should be bowels of compassion in
him that pronounces sentence of condemnacion. Ille dolet quoties cogitur esse
ferox. Augustus never pronounced a deadly sentence without deep sorrow.

Our Laws forbid Butchers to be Jurors, because it is supposed they will be
hard-hearted. Godwin. Antiq.
Among several qualifications which the Jews required in their Judges, these
were two; 1. That they should be Fathers, of children, hoping that their
paternal affection would incline them to commiseration. 2. That they should not
be Eunuchs, for they conceived such very cruel. It is a bestial cruelty to
delight in blood.

The Laws of Draco are generally condemned, for they were written in blood,
Ferina rabics est sanguine and vulneribus gaudere. Senec. de^cle. lib. 1. cap.
24.
and the offender was sure to die of what nature soever his offense was. A.
Gell.

Our English Deborah, Queen Elizabeth did not without cause exceedingly prize
Seneca's first book of Clemency, ^iero in the beginning of his Empire being
requested to set his hand to a warrant for the execution of an offender, would
say, Utinam nescirem literas.
because it treated of that which is so needful to a Prince.

It is the Devils work to be Abaddon, a destroyer. It is Christ work to be Goel
a Redeemer. Mercy and truth preserve the King, his Throne is established by
mercy, Prove. 20. 28. Mercy sometime to them that sin through weakness, may be
as profitable, as severity to them that sin through wil^ulness.

It was certainly a cursed speech of that man or rather Monster, Siles.
(whom the Italian Orator mentions) that being a Judge said, To hang many is
my Jubilee, and a great execution is my great recreation. The expression of the
Roman Emperor is worthy of imitation, Plut. in vi^. Iul. Caes.
That he had rather save the life of one of his Subjects, then take away the
lives of a thousand of his enemies. Life is a precious jewel, more worth then
all this world. Skin for skin and all that a man has will he give for his
life, Job 1. It is not therefore to be taken away for every trifle. I do not
now dispute the question, Whether any Theft may lawfully be punished with
death, but I am sure, every Theft ought not. The Romans had their Axes and Rods
carried before their Consuls, to show that if the lesser punishments, as of the
rods, would serve, the greater of the Axe should not be used. And they did
justly lament the cruelty of those tribunals where the cheap prescription of
lives made the Judgment Seat differ little from a Shambles.

3. Work as Gods among men in promoting piety to your power. The great design
and work of God is to promote holiness in the world. This was his aim in his
internal work of his decree, Ephesians. 1. 4. This is the great end he drives at,
in his external works. As in the work of redemption, Tit. 2. 14. Luke 1. 92. In
bestowing his word. (The precepts in it are the perfect rule of godliness, Gal.
6. 16. the promises are precious encouragements to godliness, 2 Cor. 7. 1. the
threatenings are like the Angel with a drawn sword in his hand to deter men from
the way of ungodliness, Romans 1. 18.) And his works of providence are to the
same purpose. Afflictions are like the fire to consume the dross, and purify
the gold, Heb. 12. 6. Mercies are like the warm influences of the vernal Sun to
draw forth the Sap of grace, and hasten men's growth in holiness.

Thus should the Gods promote godliness as the chief business which the most
high God has given them to do. Prima Magistratus cura debet esse, religionem
veram promovere, and impietatem probibere. Ames. de consc lib. 5. cap. 25.
Other things of what nature soever which come within the reach of their care,
are questionless much inferior to this. And this they should do, Ia boc reges
Deo serviunt in quantum reges. Aug.
Partly by their patterns in being examples of godliness to their people; Their
lives should be so exact that they should be able to say as Gideon, Judges. 7.
17. Lock on us and do likewise, or as Paul, Walk as ye have us for an example.

Partly by your precepts; your edicts and commands should be like those of Asa,
2 Chronicles. 14. 2. 4. Asa did that which was right in the sight of the Lord. He
commanded Judah to seek the Lord God of their Fathers, and to do the Law and
the Commandment. Mark, upright Asa did not leave men to choose their religions,
nor to live as they listed, but be commanded them to obey Gods Law. He did not
strictly enjoin the payment of Taxes or Customs, and such civil things, and
leave it as a matter of indifferency whether men would mind religion or no, but
his Laws did enforce and confirm the Laws of God, as far as he was able.

Partly by countenancing, maintaining and providing able Ministers, 2 Chronicles.
19. 8. 1 Cor. 9. 13. for the Church; as also by taking care that they discharge
their trusts faithfully, 2 Chronicles. 29. 3, 4, 5. 1 Chronicles. 16. It is observed of
Julian the Apostate, that to root up Christianity he disgraced the Orthodox
Ministry, took away Church maintenance and forbad Christian Schools and places
of learning; so Sozomen lib. 5. cap. 5. This very course is now cried up, the
Lord prevent it. The Prince indeed is not called to be a public Preacher, but
he has a call to see that none abuse that calling to the hurt or poison of his
people.

Partly by suppressing and discountenancing them whose doctrines or lives
hinder godliness. Plato would not permit in his Commonwealth any such person
as asserted God the Author of sin.
Suppressing evil is necessary for the promoting good. Holy Asa removed his
Mother from being Queen upon this very account, 1 Kings 15. 12, 13. The
toleration of any in such sins is an intolerable sin. And the jealous God will
one day make Magistrates know, that they shall bear his anger for bearing such
evil doers as blasphemers and Heretics are. I speak not against a true
Christian liberty in things that are indifferent, Christinus nulla ^ re magis
dignosci potest quam si D^o factas contumelias and blasphemias severissime u^c
scatur, suas obliviscatur. Gnevara in ep. ad Car. 5.
or in things that are not fundamental; but I cannot but speak against this
Antichristian licentiousness, which is (though under other terms) so much
pleaded for; It may well make a dumb child speak when his Father is so deeply
wounded in his Word, Honor, People, and Ordinances, as he is in our days. If
State-reason compel men to suffer it, they must know that it will prove
State-ruine. Shall it be treason and death to speak thus and thus against men
that are mor^al, weak Gods? and shall it not at all be penal to blaspheme the
Almighty and Everliving God, in denying his Truths, which are more worth then
the whole world? Surely Blasphemies, Idolatry and Heresies, sins against the
first Table, are greater (as being more directly and immediately against God)
then sins against the second Table, and therefore deserve punishments; vide 1
Kings 18. 18. Exodus 21. 17. Levit. 24. 10. to the 17. v. Job 31. 25, 26, 27.
Deuteronomy. 13. per totum; though care should be first had, and means used for the
informing and reforming such offenders.

Suffer me (as Elihu said, Job 30. 2, 3.) a little, and I will show you what I
have to speak on Gods behalf; I will fetch my knowledge from Scripture, and
will ascribe righteousness to my Maker. Because in our unholy, and therefore
unhappy days, the very duty which I am urging the Magistrate to, is questioned
as many other truths are; I shall speak a little to it. Princ^ps nibil statuat
de religione, says Mariana the Jesuit. Marian. cap. 10.
This Popish doctrine is now almost generally entertained, That Magistrates
have nothing to do in matters of Religion (as some others Jesuitical tenants
are now on foot.) Parsons the English Jesuit in his memorial for Reformation,
advises that all the Colleges in the Universities with their Revenues, should
(not be employed as now they are, for the e^couragement of godliness and
learning but) be settled on six men, and also what ever Manor or Parsonage
belonged to the Church; that no man's conscience be pressed for matters in
Religion: That there should be no fixed Ministers, only some Itinerary
Preachers: This is the way says he, for Popery to flourish in England, though
he names more ways. But that Magistrates ought to meddle in matters of
Religion, and promote it to their power, may appear clearly to them that are
not wilfully blind.

First, from the practices of godly Rulers; What Asa did, has been already
mentioned. Hezekiah was a Prince that did also promote Piety, 2 Chronicles. 29. 2.
3, 4, 5. 25. 30. and in 2 Cbron. 30. and 5. which places are large (therefore
not here recited) but full to our purpose, wherein Hezekiah commanded the
Levites to sanctify themselves, to praise the Lord with the words of David,
and both Priests and People to keep the Passover.

So Josiah, 2 Chronicles. 34. 3. ult. And the King stood in his place, and made a
Covenant before the Lord, to walk after the Lord, and to keep his
Commandments. And (mark) he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and
Benjamin to stand to it. And the Inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the
Covenant of God. And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the
Countries that pertained to the children of Israel. (Observe) And made all that
were present in Israel to serve, even to serve the Lord their God. And all his
days they departed not from following the Lord. He made them to serve the Lord
both by his precepts, and by the punishments he inflicted on them that would
not. This text can never be answered. All the subtle evasions which Jesuitical
heads have used to make it invalid, could never do it. For if as some affirm,
it is not binding to us under the New, because it is delivered in the Old
Testament, then Faith in Christ and Repentance, which are the sum and substance
of the Old Testament are void also; and so they may rob us, if we will believe
them, both of our Savior and Salvation It is observable that in the Kings and
Chronicles, when Henry the sixth mentions the lives of the Kings of Israel, he
does in the first place take notice how they de^lt in matters of Religion,
whether they brake down the graven Images, or cut down the groves, or took
away the high places, or the like.
.

Nay an Heathen King enacted a law, that whosoever would not obey the Law of
God, as well as the Law of the King, that judgment should be executed speedily
upon him, whether it be unto death, or to banishment or confiscation of goods,
or imprisoment, Ezra 7. 26. And for this Law holy Ezra blesses God, v. 27. so
Ezra 6. 11. Dan. 3. 29.

Besides these patterns in Scripture, Eusebius. lib. 2. de vit. Constantini, cap.
44.
we have the like in Ecclesiastical Writers. Constantine a godly Emperor,
Theodoret. lib. 5. cap. 20.
purged the Church of Idolatry, and established the worship of God by his own
Imperial commands. Iovinian also and Theodosius, by their Royal Edicts set up
and restored the true Religion, which Julian and Valens had put down and
discountenanced.

Secondly, The precepts given by God to Rulers, speak this to be their duty.
God commands him to write him a copy of the Law, Deuteronomy. 17. 18. For what end,
but that he might keep it himself, as he is a man, and take care that others
should not break it, as he is a Magistrate. It was an ancient Ceremony in
Israel at the Kings Coronation, that when the Crown was set on his head, the
Book of God should be given into his hand, 2 Kings 11. 12. to show that God
committed the care of Religion principally to him, that by his power and
authority it might be established in his Dominions.

God commands Magistrates to be for the good Par. on Romans
of their subjects, Romans 13. 4. For good, that is, for thy natural good in
preserving thy life in safety; for thy civil good in securing thine estate; for
thy spiritual good in establishing the true worship of God, as a keeper of the
first Table; Nay, the way to promote the civil good of a people, is, by
promoting their spiritual good. That Commonwealth will certainly stand
longest, which has not State Policy, but State-Piety for its foundation. How
many Nations have confirmed this truth, Vbi non est sanctitas, pietas, fides,
instabile regnum est! A Nation without Religion, is like a City without walls,
naked and open to all enemies; like a building without a foundation, which will
quickly be overthrown. Religion to a people is as the Palladium to the Trojans,
as the Ancile to the Romans which kept them safe. The want of this overthrew
the great Monarchies of the world. What besides this, has turned so Kingdoms
into ruined heaps, and Cities into solitary Deferts? If a fruitful land be
turned into barrenness, is it not for the iniquity of them that dwell therein!
Psalm. 107. 34. Tully Cicero de legib.
observed, that the glory of Greece quickly decayed when the people were given
to evil opinions, and evil manners. Those Rulers that tolerate heretical
persons, do but nourish a Snake in their bosoms, and cherish a worm that in
time will eat out their own bowels.

Besides, God promises that Magistrates shall in the days of the Gospel be
nursing Fathers and nursing Mothers to his Church, Isai. 49. 23. which surely
was never meant of procuring only their corporal, but chiefly of promoting
their spiritual good.

O consider, Vide Zanch. de Magistrate. Gerh. loc. com. Wallaeum de eodem sub.
Willet. in Romans 13. controver. 4.
is it not reasonable as well as religious, that you who rule by God, should
rule for God? that that power which you have received from him, should be
improved mostly for him? Remember your time is short, your opportunities are
many, your work is great, and your account will be heavy; therefore work the
work of him that sent you into the world. It was a saying of Becket, sometime
Archbishop of Canterbury, when he was persuaded to deal moderately with the
King, Clavum teneo and ad somnum me vocas, Do I sit at the stern, and would you
have me sleep? Sirs, you steer the rudder of the State, you ^it at the Helm of
the Commonwealth; should you be sleepy or ^lothful? I beseech you to be doing
for the furthering Piety, and the Lord will be with you.

Now that Magistrates may be enabled and incited to walk, and to work, as Gods
among men; I shall deliver a few directions, and two or three motives, and then
conclude.

First, If you would walk and work as Gods, then get divine principles.
According to your principles, such will your practices be; water rises no
higher then its Fountain: If therefore you would walk as God, and work for God,
you must both walk and work from God. If ever the hand of the dial point, and
go right without, the wheels and poises must be right within. It is noted of
true and sincere Saints, that acted for God in the Regal Office, That their
hearts were perfect with the Lord, 1 King. 15. 14. Isai. 38. 3. This spiritnal
life in their souls made them warm and zealous for their Savior. Caleb that
followed the Lord fully, had another spirit, a different principle from the ten
carnal Princes, Numb. 14. 24. Men's actions will then (...) sacred, when their
affections are sanctified. He that follows God he knows not why, will
forsake God he knows not how. A Magristrate that is zealous for God only
because the times favor such, may soon be brought to be as zealous against
God. He that is not knit to his service with the heart strings of love, spun
out of a renewed nature, will easily be parted from his service. Such slavish
spirits will serve God no longer then they can serve themselves of God. When
Iehu's interest and Gods are conjoined, as in rooting out the idolatry of Baal,
how fiery is Iehu? how furiously does he drive? He slays all the false
Prophets, he breaks down the Images of Baal, and the house of Baal, and
makes it a draugh-house, 2 King. 10. 25, 27. But when Gods Interest and Iehus
are divided, as in the Calves at Dan and Bethel, there Iehu must be excused, he
will uphold them (as some do by that Monster of Toleration) out of State
policy, expecting that they should uphold him, 2 King. 10. 27, 28. But what was
the reason of this? Surely the want of this divine principle; the fire of
Iehu's zeal was (not lighted at the Altar, for then it would have continued
burning, but) kitchen fire kindled at a common hearth, and therefore would burn
no longer then it had such grols matter as his own credit or profit to feed it*
when this suel was taken away, his fire went out; look in verse. 31. Iehu walked
not in the law of the Lord with all his heart; his heart was not perfect, it
was not cast into the fire of the Word, and new-moulded by the Spirit of God.
The want of this foundation over-turned all that beautiful building which Iehu
had set up.

It is a question in Politics, Whether a wicked man may be a good Magistrate?
It is I suppose possible for a wicked man when he is in authority to do some
good; but I conceive he will hardly do the good he ought; or like C^leb, stand
for God when the times are against God, when the people talked of stoning him;
but like the King of Navarre, he will launch* no further into the Ocean then he
can be sure to get back safe. Such a man is like an Horse with a thorn in his
foot, which may go fairly on in good ways, but if he come to hard ways, he
will halt, and discover himself. He that has not gone through the pangs of the
new birth, and heartily taken God in Christ for his All, and thereby secured
his eternal estate, will scarce hazard his name or estate, much less his limbs
or life for God, as he must do that will be faithful unto the death: For with
what heart can he look that danger in the face, which for ought he knows may
kill both body and soul?

Or if he be very bold and venturous for God, yet being an evil man, he can
never do good (by all his activeness as a Ruler) to his own soul. God may give
him parts, and gifts, and courage, (as a Noble man gives dainty fare to his
Nurse) not out of love to him, but for his childrens sake. He may like a ship,
be instrumental, to land others at some happy Port whereon it never enters it
self; He may be very helpful to others temporal; nay and eternal salvation, and
yet miss himself: Iehu by acting for God, got a lease of an earthly Kingdom for
three or four lives, but he lost the heavenly one for ever. The most that I
know, that a civil yet unsanctified Magistrate gets by his forwardness and heat
for God, is only a cooler hell; though your names are divine, yet if ye be not
partakers of the divine nature, ye are lost for ever. Now what advantage will
it be to you, like Noah's Carpenters, to build an Ark for the saving of others,
and to perish your selves!

Believe it Sirs, If ye would have good fruits in your lives, there must be
this root of holiness in your hearts; A good man out of the good treasure of
his heart brings forth good things. What water is in the Well, such will be
in the bucket; and what ware is in the shop, such will be on the stall;
therefore when God promises that men shall walk in his ways, and keep his
judgments, and do them; he promises also to put his Spirit, or a new spirit
into them, which should enable them thereunto. Ezekiel. 11. 19. Ezekiel 36. 26, 27.
The flesh will serve to enable a man to walk after the flesh; but the Spirit of
God alone can enable man to walk after the spirit. Natural light is not
sufficient to mortify natural lusts: It may cover for some time, but can never
kill sin. Some men may be like the Lions in Daniels den, chained up, or
restrained, and yet have their ravenous dispositions, their old carnal hearts
still. Civility though commendable, yet without inward sanctity, is not
sufficient to prove one interested in a Savior, or in a state of salvation.
There is as much difference between a Moral man and a real Christian, as
between a liveless picture and a living person: A Lion and a Lamb, a Raven and
a Dove, darkness and light, death and life do not differ more then a sinner and
a Saint, then a man only civilized and a sanctified Christian.

O Sirs, The smoke of a great man's sacrifice smells never the s^e^ter before
God, because he is perfumed wit^ Musk, or clothed in Silk.
think of it seriously, the terms upon which salvation may be had, are the same
to you and the meanest beggar, John 3. 3. If heaven be not in you by the
indwelling of Gods Spirit renewing you in the Spirit of your mind, it is
impossible that ever you should be in heaven. The tide of your natures, and the
wind of your affections must be turned the clean contrary way to what they are
by your birth, if ever you ^ail to the Haven of Heaven. Labor therefore as for
life, for this principle of spiritual life, without which you cannot escape the
second death.

Secondly, If ye would walk and work as Gods among men, then your rule must be
divine as well as your principle. Every calling has some rule to go by, in
conformity to which, their excellency consists. The Lawyer has his Littleton
and Coke* the Physician has his Galen and Hippocrates; the Philosopher has
his Aristotle; the Christian has the Word of God, a sure and a perfect rule to
walk by, Gal. 6. 16. And this Word of God is in a special manner commanded and
committed to the Magistrate as his Directory, Josh. 1. 8. This Bo^k of the Law
shall not depart out of thy mouth, (says God to the chief Governor of Israel)
but thou shall meditate therein day and night, that thou may observe to do
according to all that is written therein: for then thou shall make thy way
prosperous, and then thou shall have good success. And Deuteronomy. 17. 18, 19. The
King that sits upon the Throne, shall write him a copy of the Law: And it
shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life, that he
may learn to fear the Lord, and to keep all the words of this Law.

It is a Maxim of the Law of England, that the Law it self ought to be the rule
by which all Judges must be regulated, all controversies tried, and all cases
decided. It is good to keep close to the laws of men (that are warrantable by
Scriture) but it is best to keep close to the Word of God; There are the best
precepts for justice, the best patterns of just men; nay, and of the Infinitely
righteous God. You have the example of God himself, how just, how holy he is in
all his doings, how he walks, how he works. Caesar's ambition was to imitate
Alexander; Themistocles endeavored to resemble Miltiades. Do you labor to be
like God, to hate sin, to love holiness, to discourage the profane, to
countenance the pious, to be active and zealous both by your patterns and
precepts for the glory of God.

In all your difficulties make the Word of God your Counselor; in all your
doubts let Scripture resolve you: You may look too much to the light within
you, which is imperfect and (1 Tit.) defiled (as Q^akers make a Christ of it)
but you can never look too much to this light without you, which is perfect and
pure, without the least blemish or defect.

The Jews say, that if Printing had been fonnd out in the time of Moses, yet
was the King bound to write out two copies of the Law with his own hand; one to
keep in the Treasury, and the other to carry about with him as his Vade Mecum.
Theodosius the second, wrote the New Testament out with his own hand.
Alphonsus King of Arragon (as some say) read over the Bible fourteen times
with Lyra's Notes upon it. And that renowned Maiden Queen Elizabeth, when she
passed in triumphal state through the City of London, Speed Chronic,
after her Coronation, when the Bible was presented to her at the little
Conduit in Cheapside, she received it with both her hands, and kissing it, laid
it to her breasts, saying, that it had ever been her chiefest delight, and
should be the rule whereby she would frame her Government. This was the
delight, the joy, the counselor of that Magistrate that was after Gods own
heart, Psalm. 119. 70. 111, 24. And this made him wiser then his Teachers, then
his Elders, Psalm. 119. 97. to 100. And indeed this Book of Books only can make
a wise and good Christian, Captain, Counselor, and Ruler. Let therefore the
balance of the Sanctuary weigh all, the Oracles of God decide all, the rule of
the Word square all, and then nothing will be amiss. Let the Bible be to you as
the pillar of fire by night, and the cloud by day to the Israelites, directing
you through the Wilderness of this world, till ye come to the true Canaan.

It was a memorable saying of King Edward the fixth, Baldae. de Script. Brit^
cen^. 2.
when he was crowned, and had three Swords put into his hands, (signifying his
power over three Nations, England, France, and Ireland) Deest adhuc unus
gladius, viz. Sacrorum Bibliorum volumen; Ille liber gladius spiritus est, and
gladi is his omnibus long anteferendus; There is one Sword wanting, namely the
Sword of the Spirit, the Word of God, which excels them all.

Thirdly, let your end be divine as well as your rule, if ye would walk and
work as Gods among men. Actiones sp^cificant^r ^ ab objec^o, fin^, and
circumsta^^^is. Eustath.
The Moralists tell us that actions are much specified from their ends. If your
actions are materially good, yet if finally evil, they are denominated wicked.
If they are according to Gods Word for the matter, yet if ye make not Gods
glory your end, they are evil. Therefore if ye would have the arrows of your
actions to fl^e right, let your eyes take right aim at this mark. Do all for
God. Om^ibus op^rationibus nostris, c^^lestis inten^io adjungi debet.
Quicquid agas, p^opter Deum agas, says Luther. As ye are men, ye were created
to serve him; as Magistrates, doubly bound to honor your great Master. Gods
free grace is the fountain of your power, and therefore Gods glory must be the
end. It is reported of Tamerlane, that warlike S^ythian, that having overcome
Bajazet the great Turk, he asked him, Whether he had ever given God thanks for
making him so great an Emperor? The great Turk confessed ingenuously that he
never thought of it; to whom Tamerlane replied, That it was no wonder so
ungrateful a wretch was made a spectacle of misery; For you says he, being
b^ind of one eye, and I ^ame of one leg, was there any worth in us, why God
should set us over two great Empires of Turks and Tartars? So truly may you
think, It was mere mercy which advanced you more then others, and therefore it
is your duty to advance God more then others. If ye love your souls, take heed
of self. O how many millions by seeking themselves have lost themselves! by
seeking their own glory, pleasure, and profit for a time, have brought
themselves to shame, pain, and loss to all eternity! O Beware of this root of
bitterness, Self. Do not like Demetrius, pretend to be zealous for the Goddess,
when in truth it was for his gain. Or like watermen, row one way toward God
and Christ, and Heaven, and look another way, toward the world, and the flesh;
but give up thy self wholly to him; Lay out thy talents altogether for him;
esteem it thy felicity and privilege that thou have more advantages then
others, whereby thou may exceed others in serviceableness to thy Maker,
Preserver, and Redeemer.

Let that Peerless Prince be thy pattern, even the Lord Jesus Christ; I seek
not my own glory, John 8. 50. And when he came to die; Father, says he, I have
glorified thee on earth. I have finished the work which thou gave me to do,
John 17.

This was the Fathers end in your creation, Prove. 16. 4. Revel. 4. ult. The
Sons end in your Redemption, Luke 1. 71. 1 Cor. 6. 20. The Spirits end in your
Sanctification, Ephesians. 2. 10. John 17. 10. Therefore let this be your end;
Pray, and read, and hear, and watch over your own souls; walk inoffensively
before God; work industriously for God, and do all that God may be glorified,
1. Cor. 10. 31.

We call not those Kings happy, A^g. de ^^vit. De^ (...). 3. cap. 24.
says Austin, who reigned long, but those who have reigned most for God; Qui
potestatem suam divinae Majestati famulam faciunt; That have made their
authority serviceable to the divine Majesty. God can easily throw those Crowns
from men's heads, which are not laid at his feet. And he will assuredly lay them
low that do not set him high; for those that honor him, he will honor; but
those that despise him, shall be lightly esteemed.

I come now to the Motives, to stir you up both to walk and work as Gods among
men.

1. Consider, God beholds you this day; He takes notice, and observes how
ye walk, and how ye work. All the ways of man (Prove. 5. 21.) are before the
Lord, and he pondereth all his paths. Be your works what they will be, God
sees them, and he weighs them in the balance of the Sanctuary, and that beam
will discover it, if they be never so little too light.

He beholds not only your practices, but your principles; he knows what is
the wind which causes the Mill to go; he knows by what rule, and for what
end, and from what principle ye act; all things are, (...), naked and open in
the eyes of him with whom we have to do, Heb. 4. 13. The words are very
Emphatical, and signify thus much, That as the Lineaments and outside of the
Body is very visible when it is naked and uncloathed; and as the bowels and
inside are discovered when the body is dissected and anatomized; So are both
your outward and inwards, your actions and affections manifest, naked and open
to God.

Nay, he beholds what ye do in the dark; you may work so cunningly as to hide
your designs and works from men, but not from God; there is no darkness, nor
shadow of death where the workers of iniquity can hide themselves, Job 34. 22.
This Sun knows no night, no darkness; where ever he is (and he is infinite
and omnipresent) it is light, and day; therefore the eyes of Christ, Rev. 1.
14. are said to be as a flame of fire, implying his omniscience, and that he is
able to disperse all darkness. For Philosophy and experience teach us, that
those Creatures which have fiery eyes can see in the dark; and the reason is
clear, because they do not see as we do (Recipendo species ab objecto, sed
extra-mittendo species) by receiving species from the Object, but by sending
out species or rays, which do both inlighten the medium, the air, and apprehend
the Object. Thus Christ sees in the dark ye see: yea the darkness hides not
from him, but the night shines as the day; to him the darkness and the light
are both alike, Psalm. 139. 12.

Ponder then this omnipresence and omniscience of God, and walk before him, and
be upright, Genesis 17. 1. The Moralist would have his Scholars to live always as
in the eye of Cato: O do you live ever as in the eye of God. Beware what thou
do; for God sees thee: God stands in the Congregation, he judges among
the Gods, Psalm. 82. 1. He judges among you, he is present with you; not always
in regard of approbation; for your deeds may be evil; but always in regard of
observation.

This was Iehosaphats Argument to incite his Judges to care and caution, 2 Chronicles. 19. 6, 7. Take heed what ye do; for ye judge not for man, but for the
Lord, who is with you in the Judgment. He is with you in the judgment; With
you to commend and praise you if ye do well; to condemn and punish you if you
do ill; to observe and take notice whether ye do well or ill. As if Iehosaphat
had said, I cannot ride circuit with you, nor be present with you in all your
Councils, but the Lord a greater then I, can and does; he is with you in the
Judgment: Wherefore now let the fear of the Lord be upon you, take heed, and
do it; for there is no iniquity with the Lord our God, nor respect of persons,
nor taking of Gifts, ver. 7.

When the Ethiopian Judges were set in their seats of Judicature, Quintus Pius
in 2 Chro. 19.
certain empty Chairs were placed about them (some say twelve) into which they
imagined the holy Angels came. And this they hoped would work in their
Magistrates circumspection and fear of doing any thing unworthy the Angels
eyeobservation: I must tell you a greater then Angels is here, even the God of
Angels; therefore be wary and watchful, take heed what ye do.

Among the Egyptians it is reported, Diodor. Sicul. lib. 1.
When their Rulers were set, they caused the Image of a Divine Numen to be hung
about his neck who sat next to the Judges. The Deity is ever near you, with
you, among you: Let the consideration thereof quicken you to zeal and
faithfulness in all your transactions.

This made David, the King of Israel, so upright and holy in his Conversation:
I have kept thy prec^pts; for all my ways are before thee, Psalm. 119. 68.
Observe his holy carriage, I have kept thy precepts; and its heavenly cause,
for all my ways are before thee; or as in another place, I have set the Lord
always before me, Psalm. 16. 8. As if he had spoken, I have not done what seemed
good in my own eyes, I have not walked according to my own will, but my race
has been according to the Rule which thou have prescribed me: I have kept thy
precepts; for I considered thou wast an ear-witness to my words; therefore I
did set a watch before my lips, that I might not offend with my tongue: that
thou wast an eyewitness to my works; therefore I endeavored that my feet
might not decline thy paths: That thou wast an heart-witness to my thoughts;
therefore ^ durst not ^et vain thoughts lodge within me; I have kept thy
precepts, for all my ways are before, etc.

Surely, If Alexanders empty Chair, which his Captains when they met in
Council, sat before them, did cause them to be kept in such good order: what
behavior should the presence of God cause among the Gods!

The Jews covered Christ's face, and then they bussetted him: Men hide God from
their e^es, and think to hide themselves from Gods eyes, and then make bold to
provoke him.

Believe it Reader, God sees thee what ever thou do; he is present with thee
wherever thou art; when thou art in thy Closet, in thy Family, among thy
Neighbors, when thou art punishing Drunkards, or Swearers in the Parish where
thou live; when thou art sitting on the bench at the Sessions or Ass^ze, he
observes in what manner thou actest, whether coldly and carelessly, as one
indifferent about the discouraging of sin, though sin deal not so mildly with
men when it turns them into intolerable and eternal flames; or whether
diligently and fervently as one fired with love to his Majesty, and zeal for
his glory, and hatred of iniquity. He observes from what principle thou
actest, whether from nature or grace; and for what end thou actest, whether thy
own or his glory; whether it be to please such a man, or the blessed God;
whether to get thy self a name, or to make his name great.

Job has a notable expression, I wish it were written on every Magistrates
heart; He withdraws not his eyes from the righteous, but with Kings are they
on the throne, Job 36. 7. He is totus oculus, all eye, he sees you through and
through; his eyes are with Kings on the throne, to observe what the King does
there, to see whether Justice and Judgment are the habitation of his throne;
whether the Scepter of his Kingdom be a righteous Scepter; whether he be
clothed with grace as with a garment, and arrayed with purity as well as
purple; to see whether the zeal of Gods house do eat him up, Psalm 69. 9. and he
prefer the Spiritual before the Temporal good of his people; to see whether he
will suffer them to be lawless in Religion, and allow out of hellish policy,
that which is destructive to Piety, even a cursed Toleration.

Gods eye, Sirs, may well make you look well to your wa^king, to your hands and
hearts: Are uncleanness, injustice, oppression, lukewarmness, atheism, bribery
fit objects for Gods eye? It was ordered in the Law of Moses, that when any
went forth of the Camp to ease Nature, they should dig an hole with a Paddle,
and cover it; and the reason is given; For the Lord thy God walks in the
midst of thy Camp; therefore shall it be holy, that he see no unclean thing in
thee, and turn away from thee, Deuteronomy. 23. 13, 14. This Law notes how the
presence of God should keep us from polluting our selves; Sin is the souls
execrement; Gods walking among us should work in us an hatred of such
defilements.

Gods eye may make you work as gods among men. Cesars Soldiers were prodigal
of their blood, when he beheld them: How bold should ye be in the discouraging
the sturdiest, stateliest Offenders? How forward in the countenancing the
poorest, pious Christian, considering that God beholds you!

Epaminondas rejoiced much that he had done noble exploits, his Parents being
alive to take notice of them. What noble acts soever are done for the promoting
Godliness, for the stopping the mouth of wickedness by the children of the most
High, are all known to the everliving Father, who records them faithfully,
and will reward them bountifully; be therefore exact in your walkings, and
zealous in your working, since your labor shall not be in vain for the Lord, 1
Cor. 15. ult.

Secondly, Consider the day of your dissolutions is hastening. While ye are
creeping only in Gods way, or doing negligently Gods Work, death is posting
with speed toward you. Consider the verse following the Text; though he has
said, Ye ars Gods, and called you children of the most High, yet ye must die
like men: Your honors, and your worships, your Majesty's, and your Highness,
must shortly lie in the dust, and be as low as the meanest. Diseases spare none
for their fine Clothes, high Places, or great Estates. And the Cannon of death
does as soon hit the great Commanders as the Common Soldier, it makes no
difference. Charles the great, Pompey the great, and Alexander the great, were
all little in Deaths hands: Men in places of greatest power, are not persons
privileged from the Arrest of this surly Sergeant.

Ye that are Divine in name, have human mortal natures; and as ye are Shields
of the earth, so ye are earthen Shields. What is said of the Duke of Parma's
Sword, is true of Death; it makes no difference between Robes and Rags,
between Prince and Peasant: It is the way of all the Earth, Josh. 25. 14. The
great Road in which all Travel, and the end of all the living, Job 30. 23. The
great Inn to which all travel. There is no man, says Solomon, that has power
of his Spirit, to retain it, neither has he power in the day of death; there
is no discharge in that war, Eccles. 8. 8.

It is storied of Alexander, Quint. C^rt.
that having heard of Paradise, he was very eager of seeking it out, and for
that end came into the East part of the Earth; where an old man meeting some of
his Soldiers, bad them tell Alexander that he sought Paradise in vain; For the
way to Paradise was the way of Hu^^ility which he did not take: but faith he,
Take this stone and carry it to Alexander, and tell him that from this stone he
shall know what he is. Now the stone was a precious stone, and of such a
quality, that whatsoever thing was weighed with it, that was still the heavier;
only if it were covered with dust, then it was as light as straw; thereby
signifying that though Alexander, and men in Authority outweigh others in
life, yet when they are covered with dust, when death comes, they are as light
as others; all their greatness comes to nothing. O how little Earth contains
Great Men when they die, who will not be contented with much while they live!

If then ye must die shortly, does it not behove you to live strictly? If your
time be little, should not your work be great for God and your souls? Whether
thou will think of it, or no, death is approaching thee; the Sun does not move
faster in the Heavens, then thou art moving to the earth. The glass of thy Life
for ought thou know is nigh its last sand. Sure I am thou art now nearer
thine unchangeable estate, then ever thou were: and does it not concern thee to
walk exactly among men, and to work industriously for God! O how much will thou
wish at an hour of death, that thou had walked humbly with God, and wrought
hard for the Lord all the time of thy life!

It Is observed among the Papists, that the Cardinals, who think their Cowle and
other Rel^gious Habits ill becoming them in their health, yet are very
ambitious to die and be buried in them. And I have taken notice in several
Churches, where are the Monuments of great persons, that their Effigies must be
erected kneeling, with a Bible in their hands, holding their hands up to
heaven, and looking very devoutly with their eyes up to the same place; when I
have heard of some of them, how Profane and Athe^s^ical they were in their
Lives; that they used the name of God often in swearing, but seldom in praying,
and prized a Romance or a Play Book above, and read them oftener then the Bible.
Truly thus it is, Piety that is trampled under feet by you now in your health
and life (believe it) will be a pearl of great price with you in your sickness
and death; then ^ou will think the holiest man the happiest man; the Precisest
Christian in the most blessed condition; then you would willingly change states
with them which are now Objects of your scorn; then you will wish that you had
denied your selves, crucified the flesh, glorified God, and walked after the
Spirit; that you had spent that time in Praying and Reading, which you have
spent in Carding or Dicing, or vain Recreations; that you had improved that
wealth and strength in the Service of your Savior, for the honor of God, and
welfare of your soul, which have been laid about the World and your lusts. O
Sirs, when this time comes, you will have other thoughts of sin and holiness,
then now ye have; Sin will not be so pleasant and lovely, nor holiness so mean
and unworthy as now it is in your eyes.

Probably you can hear of death by the reports of others, As birds build in
steeples, and are never troubled at the noise of Bells, being used to it; nor
ye at the sight of graves or coffins.
and be little troubled; ye can stand it out stiffly against such false fire,
with We must all die, and Nothing so sure; God knows who shall go next, and
the like: all this while, the heart not with seriousness considering of it, so
as to be preparing for it: The soul as much neglected, God as little regarded,
and the affections as much inslaved to fleshly lusts as before. But when Death
That King of terrors and terror of Kings.
climbs up to your own windows, and enters into your Chamber and comely with
its pale face to your bed side, and boldly arresteth you with a warrant from
Heaven, assuring you by its symptoms on your body, that you must in good
earnest into the other world, and there have all your walkings and workings
interpreted and examined by the infinitely pure and righteous God, and your
souls (according to your deeds) sentenced impartially, and sent immediately to
Heaven or Hell, then surely your apprehensions of a new Nature, and strict
Conversation, will change, and you will wish with all your souls for a little
of others oil; for your Lamps will go out. The stourest unregenerate heart
alive will droop at last, when God comes to take away his soul, then his
crest-falls, and his plumes flag.

Now possibly thy Cup overfloweth, thou have a large portion of the good things
of this world, and they have so much of thy heart, that thou art little
troubled about the things of the other world; the Table of thy life now is
richly spread with honors, pleasures, relations, possessions, and these have
the largest share in thy heart; in these thou solacest thy self, desiring no
other Heaven* But what will thou do when Death shall come with a Voider, and
take all away, even all thy treasure on earth? then thou will wish thou could
find a treasure in Heaven, that thou might die the death of the Righteous,
and have thy latter end like his: But oh Friend, thou should then have lived
their lives, and have had thy conversation like theirs: as the Crab in the
Fable told the Serpent (who when she had received her deaths wound for her
crooked conditions, stretched out her self straigh^) At oportuit si^ Vixisse;
that she should have been straight in her life time. The way to make thy death
comfortable, is to make thy life serviceable to God, and thy soul. He that
would enjoy true rest when he dies, must labor faithfully and diligently
whilst he lives. It will be like a dagger at the heart in an hour of death to
reflect upon the talents misimployed, and opportunities misimproved, which free
grace afforded you for the honoring of God, and furthering of your own
salvations. Sins of omission will wound deeper at a dying hour then most are
aware of. God has committed a great trust to you, and the day of your lives is
the only time of discharging it; besides, ye know not how few hours ye may have
to your day, whether it shall be a Winter or a Summer day; the shadows of the
evening may suddenly stretch themselves upon you, and then it will be no longer
day; therefore work the work of him that sent you into the world, while it is
day, for the night comes wherein no man can work, John 9. 4. Is it not sad,
that our common observation should be so much verified in the practices of
great men, That Bells strike thick while they are rising, but stand still and
give no sound at all when they are at full pitch! That Magistrates should like
the Sun, the higher in the Zodiac, move the slower!

The more noble creatures are, the more active they are, Men more active then
Beasts, Angels then men. One I remember observes, that God would not accept
the firstborn of an Ass, because it was a a dull ^lothful creature. The Spirit
of God (which is in all that are sanctified) is compared to fire, Acts 2.
therefore they that would not grieve it, must not be ^lothful in business, but
fiery, fervent (seething hot, as the word signifies) in spirit, serving the
Lord, Romans 12. 11. Hence it was that the Church of Ephesus got letters
testimonial from Heaven, Revel. 2. 2. I know thy works and thy labor, how thou
can not bear them that are evil. And indeed the more good a Justice has in
himself, the less he will bear with evil in others.

Augustine has a true saying, Qui non zelat, non amat, He that is not zealous
for God, has no true love to God. For though love be a passion, yet it
delights to show it self in acting for the party beloved.

When Calvin grew sickly, some friends dissuaded him from hard studying, but he
gave them this answer, Vultisne Christum me invenire otiosum, would you have
Christ when he comes (to me by death) to find me idle? So do ye think, that
when sinners Iehu-like drive furiously, ye should not like Egyptians, go
heavily, least death find you idle? Observe what became of the idle servant,
that hid his talent in a napkin, Matthew 25. 30. He was punished with an eternal
long night, who would not work in his short day.

3. Consider the day of Judgment, God will then search and sentence you,
discover and reward you according to your works. Ye that examine and try
others, shall then be examined and tried your selves, and ye that acquit or
condemn others, shall then be acquitted or condemned your selves.

How should this thought move you to walk exactly, since your hearts shall be
anatomized, and your lives manifested before God, Angels and men! Could ye but
as Ierom, hear the sound of the last trump always in your ears, Arise ye dead;
and come to judgment, surely ye would be holy Judges and Justices indeed.
Peter makes this argument a strong enforcement to holiness, 2 Pet. 3. 10, 11.
The day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which the Heavens
shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent
heat; the earth also and the works therein shall be burnt^p; seeing then that
all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought we to be in
all holy conversation and godliness? Observe, the certainty of it, The day of
the Lord will come; If it were doubtful, it would not be so dreadful; but it
will come surely, though it come slowly, therefore men had need to be holy.
Tertullian observed of all those that professed Christianity in his time, none
lived so loosely as those that did not believe the certainty of the day of
judgment; But observe 2. the suddenness of it, The day of the Lord will come
as a theif in the night; when men at midnight are securely sleeping, they dream
not of, nor prepare for a theif. It is sometimes called a day, Matthew. 25. 13.
propter revelationem secretorum; things that are now dark and secret, shall be
then as clear and apparent as at noon day; the fire of that day will make
things legible which are written with the juice of Lemons. In that Spring time
both wholesome roots and poisonous will be discovered, which all the winter of
this life were hid. The books of Gods Omniscience and man's Conscience, says
one, shall be then opened, and secret sins shall be then as legible as if it
were written with the brightest star, or the most glittering Sunbeams upon a
wall of Crystal, Eccles. 12. ult. And it is said to be at night, propter
improvisionem, etc. because of most men's unpreparedness for it. The destruction
of this new world by fire will find men generally in the same careless, carnal,
secure, sensual condition, as did the destruction of the old world by water,
Luke 21. 35. as the snare on a sudden catches the bird, so will that day of
the Lord seize on such beasts. Observe 3. the dreadfulness of it, The Heavens
shall pass away with a great noise, and the Elements shall melt With fervent
heat, and the earth and the works thereof shall be burnt up. Well may it be
called the great and terrible day of the Lord, when the Judge will be a
consuming fire, Heb. 12. 29. and shall come in flaming fire, 1 These. 1. 6, 7.
try them by a fiery law, Deuteronomy. 33. 2. before a tribunal of fire, Ezekiel. 1. 27.
plead with them in flames of fire, Isa. 60. 15. and condemn ungodly ones to
eternal fire. O how dreadful is the voice and noise of Fire! Fire in the night!
how fearful and frightful then will such fires at the day of Judgment be!
Qu^ti^s di^n ill^m considero, ^oto corpore contremisco H^erom.
As often as I think of that day, my whole body trembles, says Hierom.
Observe 4. the Apostles inference from it, What manner of persons ought we to
be in all holy conversation and godliness! as if he had said, We had need to
have grace in truth, that must undergo such a trial. We that must meet with so
strict and dreadful an examination had need to be holy to admiration; What
manner of persons ought we to be in all holy conversation and godliness?

Surely if any argument imaginable can persuade to purity, this terrible day
can do it. The sound of the last Trump may well cause a retreat, and call us
off from an eager persuit of the flesh and world, Eccles. 11. 9. and it may
also stir you up to purity, if ye would meet Christ at that day in peace. The
Throne of Christ is a white Throne, Rev. 20. 11. and O with what trembling
heart will thou O black sinner stand before this white Throne, 1 Pet. 4. 18. If
the righteous be scarcely saved (not in regard of the uncertainty, but
difficulty) Where shall the sinner and ungodly appear? Surely the drunkards cup
then will be Wormwood, not Wine; The sentence on the swearer then will be of
cursing, not blessing; as he loved cursing now, so then will it come to him;
the Adulterers pleasure now will then prove poison; and the prayerless man now,
will then pray hard, work in prayer for some ease, some end, if not a pardon,
yet a reprieve, for one hour, at least one drop of water to cool his tongue;
but he shall work at the Labor in vain, and be eternally denied.

O look therefore, and make sure of true holiness, of the power of godliness;
for the fire of that day will discover whether you are dross or gold: look that
the rule by which you walk be right, even the Word of God, for by that you
shall be judged for your eternal life or death, John 12. 36.

Ah how exactly should thou live, that must be tried for thine endless estate
by so strict a law!

How diligently should thou keep thy heart, knowing that God will judge the
secrets of thy heart! Romans 2. 16. How carefully should thou keep the door of
thy lips, considering that of every (not only swearing or cursing, but) idle
word which thou shall speak, thou shall give an account at the day of Christ!
Matthew. 12. 35. How wary should thou be in all thy deeds, believing that thou
shall appear at the Judgment Seat of Christ to give an account of every thing
done in the body of flesh, whether it be good, or whether it be evil! 2 Cor. 5.
10. So think, so speak, so act, as one that must be judged for all at the great
day of Christ.

This may likewise incite you to work as Gods amongst men, because at that day
Christ will come, and his reward will be with him to give to every one
according to his works, Rev. 22. 12. Your actions now are seed; if ye would
reap liberally on that great harvest day, ye must sow liberally in this
see-time. Christ will then demand, how ye improved the many advantages, and
opportunities which he put into your hands for the magnifying his Name,
countenancing his people, propagating his Gospel, punishing his enemies, and
discouraging the workers of iniquity. He will ask you why at such a time, when
you knew his Name was blasphemed, his Day was profaned, his Ministers and
Ordinances were trampled upon; you never stirred, or were zealous for their
vindication; you thought it was good sleeping in a whole skin; you were loath to
offend your neighbors, or you were unwilling to get the ill will of great
ones, that under pretense of love to all the people of God, would have his
blasphemous adversaries spared, nay encouraged. See whether that Jesuitical
tenent, That Magistrates must only be second-table men, that they have nothing
do in matters of Religion, will hold water at that day. O how exceedingly will
such be ashamed of it then, who now own it in their principles and practices!
possibly thou art one of that Heathen Gallio's Disciples, that would meddle in
matters of wrong, but ^it still in matters of Religion, Acts 18. 14, 17. Gallio
cared for none of those things. I must tell thee, thou art like then to find
Hell hot, for thy being so cold in the cause of the blessed and glorious God.

O think of that day, and let it move thee to a faithful zealous discharge of
thy duty. Hoc inculcatum sit esse Deos, and venturum esse summum and fatalem
illum diem.
Zaleucus Locrensis in his proeme to his laws has these words, Let this be
often pressed upon men, that there are Gods, and that an account must be given
to them of men's actions. Consider the day of the Lord is coming, and who may
abide it! In a word, Hear the conclusion of the whole matter; Fear God, and
keep his commandments; for this is the whole duty of man: For God shall bring
every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or
whether it be e^il, Eccles. 12. 13, 14.
