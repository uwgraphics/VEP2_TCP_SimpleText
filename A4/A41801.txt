THE PREFACE.
AMong the many and various Dispensations of Blessings which God has always
conferred on his Church-Militant here on earth, This of revealing his holy Will
to the sons of Men, upon a due and serious reflection, seems to be none of the
meanest: for if the gradual conveyance of the S. Scriptures be considered in
all its circumstances, it will not only exhibit unto us matter of Astonishment
and Wonder; but it will also be an invinsible Argument to prove their Divine
extraction.

To omit the many and wonderful preservations of the Law under the Jewish
Economy, and to proceed to the Gospel Dispensation: When Christianity began so
mightily to prevail, and to extend it self over the whole World; then it was
that the Enemies of those Sacred Writings began to appear: the Devil (who has
never omitted any Arts or Stratagems that would any way conduce to the eternal
ruin of mankind) rallies up all his forces in opposition to them; well
knowing how greatly they would tend to the diminution of his Kingdom; for as
long as those Sacred Oracles stood as the Basis and Foundation on which
Christianity was built, his other attempts must necessarily prove vain and
unsuccessful; wherefore like a subtle Enemy, and cunning Politician, he levies
all his Forces to destroy the Foundation: rightly concluding, that if that were
once shattered, the whole Fabric must consequently come to ruin and
desolation. And in prosecution of this Design, he and his Agents have
endeavored to invalidate those Writings; though as to their matter of Fact,
not a Julian, nor a Celsus did ever assume impudence enough to deny: and that
they might the more amuse the minds of men, they imposed spurious writings,
under the Names of the venerable Penmen of the Sacred Scriptures: but this
fallacy was soon discovered; for the Majesty of those Holy Writings eminently
appearing above the others, soon put a period to this Controversy. All
pretended Revelations have visibly discovered their nakedness, and soon
betrayed their own mean descent. But as it is commonly observed, that after a
Defeat, there is a general Rendezvous of all Forces, to make the last assault,
which is usually very formidable; so these infernal Powers having been
disappointed in their first enterprise, could not rest satisfied, until they
had changed the Scene, and appeared in more hostile shape than ever: Defamation
now was not sufficient, but the total Destruction of the Word of God was
designed.

And now to the amazement of the World (after many other mighty Enemies to the
Christian Cause) up starts Dioclesian, an Enemy no less potent than formidable,
who set forth an Edict that all Christians should deliver up their Scriptures,
and that the Writings of the Church should be burnt, which was prosecuted with
great rigor and fierceness; and he was so confident of the success of it, that
on a Column which was erected to him, as a Trophy of his extinguishing the
Christian faith, he had this in the inscription. -- Superstitione Christi
ubique deleta, Grut^ inscript. page 280.

And what could now be expected, but that the whole Christian Name should have
been extirpate? for Persecutions began again to look with a most terrible
aspect; and now it was that such a multitude of Christians offered themselves
as Victims to appease the rage of their cruel Adversaries with their
Martyr-flames, rather than deliver up what was most dear to them in the World,
viz. their Bibles: and those who by fear or any other inducements were
persuaded to the contrary, were approbriously called Traditores.

And who could imagine that this stratagem should have been defeated? Who could
have thought that these inquisitive and inveterate Enemies should have their
designs and intentions thus frustrated? But God, who at all times has given us
signal Demonstrations of their Divinity, by his miraculous and wonderful
preservation of them, was not wanting at this time, but mightily rescued them
from the flames of these wicked Persecutors. What was here but the special
Providence, the Finger of God, to be seen in this great Deliverance? Who but an
Omnipotent Power could now sustain the Christian faith, when all humane and
infernal Power were bent against it? But thus did the sacred Oracles triumph
over its Adversaries, baffled all assaults and Enemies, and stood unmoved like
a mighty Rock in the midst of the Sea, outbraving all Storms and Tempests.

But although the Sacred Scriptures have been thus conveyed down to us, having
their Divine Authority confirmed by the suffrages of all Ages; and although
they answer the ends and purposes of their Author, viz. That they should be the
Rule of our Faith, the infallible Standard by which all Actions should be
measured; That in them are contained the whole Essentials of Religion, the
words of Eternal Life, etc. Yet it is thought (and not without just grounds) a
Design that may not be altogether unuseful to the Public, for the more
exquisite use upon any emergent occasion, that those Scriptures which lie here
and there dispersed throughout the whole Sacred Repository, belonging to one
place or Subject, be reduced to their proper Heads, that so the use of the
whole may be rendered more obvious to the diligent Enquirer. This is the Design
of the ensuing Tract; a Work of no small pains and labor: For it is possible a
man may be a good Textuary, and yet upon many occasions may want that full
satisfaction which those sacred Treasures afford: To obviate which difficulty,
no Concordance (that I know of will very much contribute.

And indeed, the Reduction of the Sacred Scriptures to this Method must needs
be very grateful to any that have time and leisure for a serious perusal of
them, especially to Divines, who cannot choose but frequently have recourse to a
Work of this nature.

As to the whole Composure, or selecting the Texts of Scripture to their
several Heads or Subjects, or the pertinency of them to the place they belong
to, either for probation, illustration, or the like: The Author has consulted
several Eminent and learned Men, who have fufficiently given their Approbation
of it, and greatly encouraged its Publication.

The Epistle to the Reader will give a particular account of the usefulness of
the Work.

The PREFACE to the Reader.
THat the Holy Scriptures are one of the greatest blessings which God bestows
upon the sons of men, is generally acknowledged by all who know any thing of
the value and worth of them. To show their Use and Excellency, is beyond the
Authors present design or intendment; it is already done by one or other to good
purpose every day. In them the Lord has dilucidly displayed that Counsel of
his Will, that is of infinite concernment to us to understand, in order to our
present being accepted of him here, and at last brought to the fullest
enjoyment of himself in glory. It Is wonderful to behold, how full and perfect
this Word is, with respect to this end; What can man desire to know, which is
necessary hereunto, that the light thereof discovers not? What direction can he
expect, by which he may be fortified against all enemies of his good, either
within or without him, that is not there given? What encouragements would he
have which are not therein displayed before him? And what Cavils can be brought
against any part of Truth contained therein, to which they themselves yield not
a full resolve? (one place of Scripture so exactly clearing, expounding, and
illustrating another) yet (to amazement) its observed, That man (who is so
highly and principally concerned in it) does too too little value it; he can
weary himself in any secular affair, but diligently to search the Scriptures
(according to our Lords advice) is to him tedious and burdensome. Few covet to
be mighty in the Scriptures; though convinced, their great concern is inveloped
in them: A spirit of self-fulness, pride, spiritual sloth, drowsiness and
deadness, lies at the bottom of this sinful neglect. To encourage, awaken
persons to a more diligent through search of the mind of God herein, is a
service no less profitable than seasonable at this day. And what greater
external encouragement, than to make that facile and easy, which seemed
inconquerably arduous and difficult?

This is the design of the ensuing Treatise: nor is the Author altogether
without hopes (wherein he has the concurring-judgment of several eminently
learned and judicious Divines who have perused it) but, by the blessing of God,
it may have a singular tendency to the enlightening of some, and establishing of
others in divine Tuths (when uno intuitu they see the Scriptures, upon which
they are built), and enabling them with ease to confute gainsayers. This has
prevailed upon him, to give leave for the publishing of it fot the Common good,
having found it to be of great use to himself to the ends beforementioned. For
here the several Texts of Holy Scripture (which lie scattered in the book of
God, are collected together, transcribed and placed (in the order as they lie
in the Bible) under several and particular Heads (a fruit of many years labor
in frequent reading through the whole Old and New Testament, with serious
thoughts upon it, and prayer to God, to the end the scope and meaning of the
Holy Ghost in each Text might be found out). And where any Subject is fallen
on, and mentioned in the general head, (and sometimes also in a particular
head) there (for the most part) is to be found all that relate to that matter,
immediately following under particular heads, or subdivisions, to the end that
the whole thereof may be met with together: or, at least, there are references
to some other general or particular head, where it is placed more properly.

And here note, Christian Reader, That thou have not only the places positive
to the Subject there, but also such which are any ways argumentative, or
enforcing (whether by Examples, the equity of the things, the nature of God,
his approbation of Promises to, or threatenings against it) or any way
illustrating or expounding of it, by whatsoever terms they are expressed:
whereof a little use of this Treatise will soon give thee a full evidence.

But, to prevent prejudice and mistakes, and give thee some light in the way
and method the Author has taken, He proposes to thy observation these few
things following.

First, To prevent prejudice, do the Author and thy self this right, Not to
make a judgment by the reading of one or two Texts at the beginning of any
head: for possibly they may not at the first blush seem to thee so pertinent to
the matter, as others do which follow; they may be only argumentative, and not
positive: For the Author so placed them on purpose, that they might run in
order, as they lie in the Bible, that the Reader might go to any Text of either
Testament, without turning backward and forward, and for other advantages; and
thence it happens sometimes, That the Scriptures less to the purpose, first
occur to thy View.

Likewise, pass not sentence upon any Text thou shall find under any head, as
impertinent to the Subject there, until thou have seriously weighed the same:
for possibly in so doing, thou may discern something in that Scripture, which
thou never did observe before, nor might have taken notice of, had not the
Head or Subject there, turned thy thoughts upon it.

And then, the Author doubts not, but that the Composure it self (when
judiciously considered) will prevent this Censure, That it is a needless Work,
as having been done already by others: This being a thing of another nature
than any yet extant, and will be helpful at another rate. For, (notwithstanding
any other helps) the finding out of apt Scriptures for illustrating,
confirming, and making use of any Truth which may be upon the thoughts of any,
have been, as it is, a difficult and laborious Work; and thence men oft-times
use Scriptures, either not Apt, according to the intent of the Holy Ghost
there; or such, the genuine sense of which is doubted. And for the use of
Concordances herein, each man's memory must record the Scriptures: for they must
first occur to his thoughts, then his judgment must fix upon some word therein,
under which the Text is placed: and it is possible not hit the right term under
which it is; and oft-times look a long time ere he come to it, because of the
multitude of words there used: and happily miss at last too, and be put upon
searching under another term. But here thou may only turn to the Subject thou
inquire after, and (without any such steps) find Scriptures full and apt
thereto (by whatsoever Terms or Phrases they are expressed) occur to your Eye
at an instant; and almost (if not altogether) all the Scripture affords to that
Subject; and present thee with matter of Enlargement, which possibly thou
thoughtest not of.

Secondly, To give thee some light in the Method, and to help thee in the use
of this.

First, Take notice, that in Chap. 13. [of Saints failings] The first Texts are
to prove each person his Saintship; then the next following, their failings:
and this is done on purpose, that it might appear they are the failings of
Saints: and so proper to the Head.

2dly, Note also, That the words within a Parenthesis beginning with [or] are
the Marginal Readings.

3dly, Some general Heads have no particulars following, but the whole placed
under that general Head. This is so done, either because the Texts which the
Scripture affords to that Subject, are but few in the whole, and so easily run
through; or that the matters are so various, that almost every verse carries a
distinct thing in it, yet still relating to the general Head; as that [of the
Saints Priviledges] each Text almost a distinct Privilege: so that [of the
Character of Saints] and some others of like nature: And here to have descended
to particular Heads, would have been tedious and unnecessary; for the words
being there transcribed, the Reader may presently inform himself, in the whole,
and in every particular.

Lastly, A little pains in observing the Contents or Table in the front of the
Book, which does contain the General and particular Heads therein, and also the
References thereto, and directs to Chapter and Page where each lies, will
enable thee to discern more of the Method and usefulness of this Work, than can
be well expressed in a short Epistle.

Therefore this shall suffice, supposing the Work it self will show its own
usefulness and advantage to Meditation about Divine matters: holding a man to
one Subject, and yielding variety of matter to enforce it upon the mind, and
leave impression there: when bare reading a Chapter or two (as foam use to do
as a task) proves not effectual for that end; and searching proves laborious:
and to many (by reason of the difficulty of finding) discouraging also.

eyes. And you shall teach them your children speaking of them when thou sit

hope, etc Thy word has quickened me, etc. Unless thy law had been my delight,
I had perished in my affliction, etc. Thou through thy commandments have made
me wiser than mine enemies, etc. I have more understanding than all my
teachers; for thy Testimonies are my meditation. I understand more than the
ancients, etc. How sweet are thy words to my taste! thy word is a lamp to my
feet, etc. I hope in thy word, the entrance of thy words gives light, it

it. Therefore I am full of the fury of the Lord, etc. Jer. 6. 10, 11.

him speak my word faithfully: what is the chaff to the wheat, says the Lord?
Is not my word like as fire, says the Lord, and like a hammer which breaks
the rock in pieces? Jer. 23. 28, 29.

unto us by them who heard, God also bearing witness both with signs, etc. Heb.
2. 1, 2, 3, 4.

Wherefore as the holy Ghost says, To day if ye will hear his voice, Heb. 3. 7.

prophecy, whereunto ye do well that ye take heed as unto a light which shines
in a dark place, etc. Knowing this, first, that no prophecy of the Scripture
is of any private (or proper) interpretation: for the Prophecy came not in old

by the holy Ghost, 2 Pet. 1. 12, 13, 15, 16, 19, 20, 21.

This second Epistle I write unto you, in both which I stir up your pure minds
by way of remembrance, That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken of
before by the holy Prophets, and of the commandment of us the Apostles of the
Lord and Savior, etc. Paul also according unto the wisdom given unto him, has

CHAP. VI. The Case the Law concludes men under.
Under sin and guilt.
DO not think that I will accuse you to the father: there is one who accuses
you, even Moses, in whom ye trust, John 5. 45.

We have before proved (or, charged) both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all
under sin; as it is written, there is none righteous, etc. Whatsoever the law
says, it says unto them who are under the law: that every mouth may be
stopped, and all the world may become guilty (or, subject to the judgment of
God) before God, etc. There is no difference, for all have sinned, and come
short of the glory of God, Romans 3. 9, 19, 23.

Where no law is, is no transgression, Romans 4. 15.

Until the law, sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed, when there is no
law, etc. The law entered, that the offense might abound, etc. Romans 5. 13, 20.

I had not known sin but by the law: etc. Without the law, sin was dead, I was
alive without the law once, but when the commandment came, sin revived and I
dyed, etc. That sin might appear sin, etc. And by the commandment might become
exceeding sinful, Romans 7. 7, 8, 9, 13.

For God has concluded them all (or, shut them up together) in unbelief, etc.
Romans 11. 32.

The strength of sin is the law, 1 Cor. 15. 56.

The scripture has concluded all men under sin, Gal. 3. 22.

Under the curse thereof.
Cursed be he, who confirms not all the words of this law to do them; And,
etc. Deuteronomy. 27. 26.

If thou will not, etc. To do all his commandments and his statutes, which I
command thee, etc. All these curses shall come upon thee. Cursed thou, etc.
Deuteronomy. 28. 15, 16, 17, 18. etc.

Thus says the Lord God of Israel, cursed the man who obeys not, etc. Jer.
11. 3, 4.

For as many as are of the works of the law, are under the curse, for it is
written, cursed is every one who continues not in all things which are written
in the book of the law to do them, Gal. 3. 10.

The Deeds of the Law, or sacrifices under it, cannot justify, o^ (...) (...)
but still leave sinners under guilt, condemnation and wrath.
How should man be just with God (or, before God)? if he will (...) with him,
he cannot answer one of a thousand, Job 9. 2, 3.

Enter not into judgment, etc. For in thy sight shall no flesh be justified,
Psalm. 143. 2.

When ye have done all that is commanded you, say, we are unprofitable
servants, etc. Luke 17. 10.

The parable, to such who trusted in themselves, that they were righteous, etc.
Two men went into the temple, etc. The Publican went away justified, rather
than the Pharisee, who had much to boast of his doings, Luke 18. 9, 10, 11, 12,
13, 14. Matt. 3. 9.

There is one, who accuses you, even Moses in whom ye trust, Joh. 5. 45.

By him, all who believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not
be justified by the law of Moses; Act. 13. 39.

By the deeds of the Law, there shall no flesh be justified in his sight, Romans
3. 20.

For if they who are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise
is made of none effect. Because the law works wrath, Romans 4. 14, 15.

For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ dyed, etc. Romans 5.
6, 10.

What the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, etc. Romans 8.
3.

Israel who followed after the law of righteousness, has not attained to the
law of righteousness. Wherefore? because not by faith, but as it were, by the
works of the law: for they stumbled at that stumbling stone, Romans 9. 31, 32.

Christ is the end of the law, for righteousness to every one who believe, Romans
10. 3, 4.

I know nothing by my self: yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judges
me is the Lord, 1 Cor. 4. 4.

The strength of sin is the law, 1 Cor. 15. 56.

A man is not justified by the works of the law, etc. For by the works of the
law shall no flesh be justified, etc. If righteousness come by the law, then
Christ is dead in v^in, Gal. 2. 16, 21.

That no man is justified by the law, in the sight of God it is evident: for
the just shall live by faith, and the law is not of faith; but the man who does
them, shall live in them, etc. Wherefore then serves the law? it was added
because of transgression, till the seed should come, etc. If there had been a
law given, which could have given life, verily, righteousness should have been
by the law, etc. Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster unto Christ, Gal. 3.
11, 12, 19, 21, 24.

Christ is become of none effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by
the law, ye are fallen from grace, Gal. 5. 4.

By grace ye are saved, etc. Not of works, lest any man should boast, Ephesians. 2.
8, 9.

Paul was very zealous of the law, and if any man had whereof to boast in that
respect, he more; yet he accounted all but loss and dung for Christ, and that
he might be found in him, not having his own righteousness, which is of the
law, Phil. 3. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

The law is good, if a man use it lawfully, knowing that the law is not made
for the righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, etc. 1 Timothy 1. 8, 9.

Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy
he has saved us, Titus 3. 5.

If therefore perfection were by the Levitical Priesthood, etc. What further
need was there that another priest should rise, etc? For the law made nothing
perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope, Heb. 7. 11, 19. chap. 8. 5, 6, 8.

In which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, which could not make him who
did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience, Heb. 9. 9.

For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of
the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year
continually, make the comers thereunto perfect: For then would they not have
ceased to be offered, because that the worshippers once purged, should have had
no more conscience of sins: But in those sacrifices a remembrance of sin again
every year: For it is not possible that the blood of Bulls and Goats should
take away sins, etc. Sacrifice and offerings thou would not, etc. In burned
offerings, etc. Thou had no pleasure, etc. Sacrifices which can never take
away sin, Heb. 10. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 11. chap. 13. 9, 10.

Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty
of all. For he who said, etc. James 2. 10.

We are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy
rags, Isa. 64. 6.

When ye have done all these things which are commanded you, say, we are
unprofitable servants, we have done that which was our duty to do, Luke 17. 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

If the ministration of death written and engraven in stones was glorious, so
that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses, for
the glory of his countenance, which was to be done away, etc. How shall not the
ministration of the spirit be rather glorious? For if the ministration of
condemnation be glory, much more does the ministration of righteousness exceed
in glory; for even that which was made glorious, had no glory in this respect,
by reason of the glory which excels: For if that which is done away was
glorious, much more that which remains is glorious, 2 Cor. 3. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

etc. Isa. 40. 5. Luke 3. 4, 5, 6.

put my spirit upon him, he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles, etc. I

CHAP. VIII. How Christ wrought this Salvation for sinners, and what he was
made, and is; what he undertook, and did, in order to it.
First, He is Mediator.
THere is one God, one Mediator between God and man, the man Jesus Christ, 1 Timothy 2. 5.

By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament, Heb. 7. 22.

He is made the Mediator of a better Testament, which was established upon
better promises, Heb. 8. 6.

And for this cause he is the mediator of the New Testament, that, etc. Heb.

And to Jesus the Mediator of the new Covenant, or Testament, Heb. 12. 24.

God said to the serpent, etc. I will put enmity between thee and the woman,
and between thy seed and her seed, it shall bruise thy head, and thou shall
bruise his heel, Genesis 3. 15.

Behold, a Virgin shall conceive and bear a Son, and shall call his name
Immanuel, Isa. 7. 14.

And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a branch shall
grow out of his roots: And the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, etc.
Isa. 11. 1, 2. Act. 13. 22, 23.

His visage was so marred, more than any man, and his form more than the sons
of men, Isa. 52. 14.

He has no form nor comeliness: and when we shall see him, there is no beauty
that we should desire him, he is despised and rejected of men, a man of
sorrows, etc. We hid, as it were, our faces from him, he was despised, and we
esteemed him not, Isa. 53. 2, 3.

The Lord has created a new thing in the earth: a woman shall compass a man,
Jer. 31. 22.

They shall smite the Judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek, Micha. 5. 1.

The birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise, etc. Mary was found with child of
the holy Ghost, etc. She had brought forth her firstborn son, and he called
his name Jesus, Matt. 1. 18, 20, 23, 25.

Thou shall conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shall call his
name Jesus, the holy thing which shall be born of thee, shall be called the son
of God, Luke 1. 31, 35.

He was tempted of the Devil, Matt. 4. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

And Jesus said unto them, the foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have
nests: but the son of man has not where to lay his head, Matt. 8. 20.

Is not this the Carpenters son? Is not his mother called Mary? And his
brethren James, etc? And they were offended in him, Matt. 13. 55, 56, 57.

He rode upon an Ass into the City of Jerusalem, Matt. 21. 2, 4, 7.

She brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swadling-clothes, and
laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the Inn, etc. He

David, etc. Knowing that God had sworn with an Oath to him, that of the fruit
of his loins according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ, etc. Act. 2. 29,
30.

Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, who was made of the seed of David,
according to the flesh, Romans 1. 3. 2 Timothy 2. 8.

God sending his Son, in the likeness of sinful flesh, Romans 8. 3.

Of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, Romans 9. 5.

Ye know the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for
your sakes he became poor, etc. 2 Cor. 8. 9.

Though he was Crucified through weakness, yet he lived, 2 Cor. 13. 4.

God sent forth his Son made of a woman made under the Law, Gal. 4. 4.

But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the sorm of a Servant,
and was made in the likeness of men; and being found in fashion as a man, he
humbled himself, and became obedient, etc. Phil. 2. 7, 8.

Has he reconciled in the body of his flesh through Death, etc. Col. 1. 21, 22.

Great is the mystery of godliness, God was manifested in the flesh, 1 Timothy 3.
16.

Jesus who was made a little lower than the angels, for the suffering of death,
etc. He who sanctifies, and they who are sanctified are all of one, for which
cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren, etc. As the children are
partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same,
that through death, etc. Verily he took not on him the nature of Angels, but he
took on him the seed of Abraham, wherefore in all things it behooved him to be
made like unto his brethren, Heb. 2. 9, 11, 14, 16, 17.

Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers, etc. Though he
were a son, yet learned he obedience, etc. Heb. 5. 7, 8.

Sacrifice, etc. thou would not, but a body have thou prepared me, etc. A
new and living way which he has consecrated (or, made) for us, through the
vail, that is to say, his flesh, Heb. 10. 5, 20.

Every spirit who confesses that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is of God,
and every spirit which confesses not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh,
is not of God, 1 John 4. 2, 3.

Many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ
is come in the flesh, 2 John v. 7.

3dly, He is made an high Priest.
And I will raise me up a faithful Priest, who shall do according to that which
is in mine heart, and in my mind, and I will build him a sure house, and he
shall walk before mine anointed for ever, 1 Samuel 2. 35.

The Lord has sworn and will not repent, thou a Priest for ever, after the
order of Melchisedeck, Psalm. 110. 4. Heb. 5. 5, 6.

Thus says the Lord, David shall never want a man, etc. Neither shall the
Priest, the Levites want a man before me to offer, etc. Jer. 33. 17, 18.

The man whose name is the branch, etc. he shall be a Priest upon his Throne,
and, etc. Zech. 6. 13.

It behooveth him in all things to be made like his brethren, that he might be
a merciful and faithful high Priest in things pertaining to God, to make
reconciliation for sins: for in that he himself has suffered being tempted, he
is able to succor them who are tempted, Heb. 2. 17, 18.

Consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession Christ Jesus, who was
faithful to him who appointed him, as also Moses was, etc. Heb. 3. 1, 2.

Seeing then, that we have a great High Priest, who is passed into the heavens,
Jesus the son of God, let us hold fast, etc. For we have not an High Priest,
which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities: but was in all
points tempted like as we are, yet without sin, Heb. 4. 14, 15.

For every High Priest taken from among men, is ordained for men in things
pertaining unto God, that he may offer, etc. Who can have compassion on (or,
can reasonably bear with) the ignorant and them who are out of the way, etc.
And no man takes this honor to himself, but he who is called of God, as
Aaron. So also Christ glorified not himself, to be made an High Priest: but he
who said unto him, thou art my son, etc. Thou a Priest, etc. Heb. 5. 1, 2, 3,
4, 5.

Hope which we have as an anchor of the soul, sure and steadfast, and which
enters within the vail; whither the forerunner is for us entered; Jesus made
an High Priest for ever after the order of Melchisedeck, Heb. 6. 19, 20.

For this Melchisedeck king of Salem, Priest of the most high God, etc. having
neither beginning of days, nor end of life: but made like unto the son of God,
abides a Priest continually, etc. After the similitude of Melchisedeck, there
arises another Priest, who is made not after the law of a carnal commandment,
but after the power of an endless life: for he testifies thou art a Priest for
ever after the order of Melchisedeck, etc. Not without an oath, for those were
made without an oath, but this with an oath, by him who said unto him, the Lord
swear and will not repent, thou art a Priest, etc. And they truly were many
priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death: but
this man because he continues for ever, has an unchangeable Priesthood (or
which passes not from one to another, wherefore he is able to save them to the
uttermost (or, for evermore) who come unto God by him, seeing he ever lives to
make intercession for them. For such an High Priest became us, who was holy,
etc. Who needs not daily as those high priests offer, etc. For this he did
once when he offered up himself. For the law makes men Highpriests who have
infirmities, but the word of the Oath which was since the law, makes the son
who is consecrated (or, perfected) for evermore, Heb. 7. 1, 3, 15, 16, 17, 21,
23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28.

But Christ being come an High Priest of good things to come, by a greater and
more perfect tabernacle, etc. Heb. 9. 11.

Now of the things which we have spoken, this is the sum. We have such an
High Priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the
heavens. A minister of the sanctuary (or, holy things) which the Lord pitched
and not man; for every High Priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices,
wherefore it is of necessity that this man should have somewhat also to offer,
Heb. 8. 1, 2, 3.

4thly, He offered himself as a sacrifice to God, suffered for the sins of
mankind, and so made peace through the shedding of his own blood, by which he
entered into the Holiest for us.
The Assembly of the wicked have enclosed me; they pierced my hands and my
feet, etc. they part my garment amongst them, and cast lots for my vesture.
Psalm. 22. 16, 18.

For thy sake I have born reproach, shame has covered my face: I am become a
stranger to my brethren, an alien unto my mothers children: for the zeal of
thine house has eaten me up; and the reproaches of them who reproach thee, are
fallen upon me, etc. reproach has broken my heart, and I am full of heaviness,
etc. they gave me also gall for my meat, and in my thirst they gave me vinegar
to drink, Psalm. 69. 7, 8, 9, 20, 21.

I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them who plucked off the hair:
I hid not my face from shame and spitting. Isa. 50. 6.

He is despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows, and acquainted with
grief, etc. Surely he has born our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did
esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted: he was wounded for our
transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities, the chastisement of our
peace was upon him, and with his stripes (or, bruise) we are healed, etc. We
have turned every one to his own way, and the Lord has laid the iniquity of us
all upon him (or, he has made the iniquity of us all to meet on him). He was
oppressed, he was afflicted, etc. He was taken from prison and from judgment,
etc. He was cut off out of the land of the living, for the transgression of my
people was he stricken (or, was the stroke upon him). He made his grave with
the wicked, etc. It pleased the Lord to bruise him, he has put him to grief;
when thou shall make his soul an offering (or, when his soul shall make an
offering) for sin, etc. he shall bear their iniquities, etc. He has poured out

one new man, so making pea^. That he might reconcile both unto God in one body
by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby, (or, in himself) and came and

therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the
saints, and of the household of God, Ephesians. 2. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 8, 19.

And having made (or, making) peace through the blood of his cross, by him to

Justification and Sanctification before God.
Let not them who wait on thee, O Lord God of Hosts, be ashamed for my sake;
let not those who seek thee, be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel;
because for thy sake I have born reproach, shame has covered my face; I am
become a stranger to my brethren, etc. for the zeal of thine house, etc. and
the reproaches of them who reproached thee, have fallen upon me, etc. Psalm. 69.
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, etc.

Surely shall one say, In the Lord have I righteousness and strength, etc. in
the Lord shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory, Isa. 45.
24, 25.

By his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear
their iniquities, Isa. 53. 11.

I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean from all your
filthiness, and from all your idols will I cleanse you, etc. I will also save
you from all your uncleanness, etc. Not for your sakes do I this, says the
Lord God, be it known unto you: Be ashamed and confounded for your own ways, O
house of Israel. Thus says the Lord God, in the day that I shall have cleansed
you from all your iniquities, etc. Ezekiel. 36. 22, 25, 29, 32, 33.

The Lord whom ye seek, shall suddenly come, etc. for he is like a refiners
fire, etc. He shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and
silver, etc. then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto
the Lord, Mal. 3. 1, 2, 3, 4.

The Pharisee prayed thus: God, I thank thee that I am not as other men are,
extortioners, etc. I fast twice a week, etc. And the Publican standing afar
off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, etc. saying, God be
merciful unto me a sinner. I tell you, This man went down unto his house
justified, rather than the other, Luke 18. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

And by him all who believe are justified from all things, from which ye could
not be justified by the law of Moses, Acts 13. 39.

Therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith; as it is
written, The just shall live by faith, Romans 1. 17.

The righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the
law and the prophets, even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus
Christ, unto all, and upon all them who believe, etc. Being justified freely by
his grace, through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ, whom God has set
forth, etc. to declare his righteousness, etc. to declare, I say, his
righteousness; that he might be just, and the justifier of them who believe in
Jesus: where is boasting then, etc? Wherefore we conclude, That a man is
justified by faith without the deeds of the law, Romans 3. 21, 22, 24, 25, 26,
27, 28.

Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness. Now to
him who works, is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt. But to him
who works not, but believes on him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is
counted unto him for righteousness, even as David describes the blessedness of
the man unto whom God imputes righteousness without works, etc. He received
the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith, etc. that
he might be the father of them who believe, though they be not circumcised,
that righteousness might be imputed unto them also, etc. for the promise, etc.
not to Abraham, or to his seed through the law; but through the righteousness
of faith, etc. It was imputed to him for righteousness: now it was not written
for his sake alone, that it was imputed unto him; but for us also, to whom it
shall be imputed, if we believe on him who raised up Jesus, etc. who was
delivered for our offenses, and was raised again for our justification, Genesis
15. 6. Romans 4. 3, 4, 5, 6, 11, 13, 22, 23, 24, 25.

Being justified by faith, etc. much more then being now justified by his
blood, we shall be saved, etc. The free gift of many offenses unto
justification, etc. As by one offense judgment came upon all to condemnation;
even so by the righteousness of one (or, by one righteousness) the free gift
came upon all men to justification of life, etc. By the obedience of one shall
many be made righteous, Romans 5. 1, 9, 16, 17, 18, 19.

There is therefore now no condemnation to them who are in Christ Jesus, etc.
Whom he did foreknow, etc. them he also justified, etc. Who shall lay any thing
to the charge of Gods elect? it is God who justifies: Who is he who
condemns? it is Christ who died, yea rather that is risen again, etc. Romans 8.
(...). 29, 30, 33, 34.

The Gentiles who followed not after righteousness, have attained unto
righteousness, etc. which is of faith. But Israel who followed after the law of
righteousness, has not attained unto the law of righteousness. Wherefore?
because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law,
Romans 9. 30, 31, 32.

They being ignorant of Gods righteousness, and going about to establish their
own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God:
for Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one who believes,
etc. The righteousness which is of faith says on this wise, etc. for with the
heart man believes unto righteousness, Romans 10. 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and
sanctification, etc. 1 Cor. 1. 30.

But ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of
the Lord Jesus, 1 Cor. 6. 11.

God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not imputing their
trespasses to them. He has made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin, that we
might be made the righteousness of God in him, 2 Cor. 5. 19, 21.

A man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus
Christ. Even we believe, etc. that we may be justified by the faith of Christ,
and not, etc. Gal. 2. 19.

Paul to the Galatians does argue this at large, Gal. 3.

We through the spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith, etc. Gal.
5. 5.

Christ gave himself, etc. that he might sanctify and cleanse it, etc. that he
might present it to himself a glorious Church, not having spot or wrinkle, or
any such thing; but that it should be holy, and without blemish, Ephesians. 5. 25,
26, 27.

When Paul above any others had whereof to boast for his exactness in keeping
the Law, he said, But what things were gain to me, them (or, those) I counted
loss for Christ, etc. that I may win Christ, and be found in him, not having
mine own righteousness which is of the law, but that which is through the faith
of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith, Phil. 3. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
9.

And you, etc. has he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death, to
present you holy, and unblameable, and unreprovable in his sight, Colos. 1. 21,
22.

And ye are complete in him, who is the head of all principalities, etc. Col.
2. 10.

Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all
iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, Tit. 2. 14.

After that the loving kindness of God appeared, etc. not by works of
righteousness which we have done, etc. that being justified by his grace, we
should be made heirs, etc. Tit. 3. 4, 5, 7.

Who, etc. when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down, etc. Heb. 1. 3.

If the blood of bulls, etc. sanctifies to the purifying of the flesh: how
much more shall the blood of Christ, who, etc. purge your consciences from dead
works, etc. Heb. 9. 13, 14.

By the which will we are sanctified, through the offering of the body of Jesus
Christ once for all, etc. by one offering he has for ever perfected them who
are sanctified, etc. Heb. 10. 10, 14.

Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood,
suffered without the gate, etc. Heb. 13. 12.

Who his own self bare our sins, etc. by whose stripes we were healed, 1 Pet.
2. 24. Isa. 53. 5.

Jesus, etc. who has loved us, and washed us with his own blood, etc. Rev. 1.
5.

These were redeemed (or, bought) from among men, etc. they were without fault
before the throne of God, Rev. 14. 4, 5.

Eternal life and Salvation.
The just shall live by his faith, Hab. 2. 4.

Christ said unto Zacheus, This day is salvation come to this house, etc. for
the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost, Luke 19. 9, 10.

So must the Son of man be lifted up, that whosoever believes in him, should
not perish, but have eternal life. For God so loved the world, that he gave his
only begotten Son, that whosoever believed in him, should not perish, but have
everlasting life, etc. He who believes on the Son, has everlasting life, etc.
John 3. 14, 15, 16, 36.

Ye will not come unto me, that ye may have life, John 5. 40.

The bread of God is he who comes down from heaven, and gives life unto the
world, etc, I am the bread of life, etc. This is the will of him who sent me,
that every one who sees the Son, and believes on him, may have everlasting
life; and I will raise him up at the last day, etc. This is the bread which
came down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof and not dye. I am the living
bread which came down from heaven; if any man eat of this bread, he shall live
for ever: and the bread that I will give, is my flesh, which I will give for
the life of the world, etc. Whosoever eats my flesh, etc. has eternal life, etc.
As, etc. I live by the Father: so he who eats me, even he shall live by me,
etc. Lord, to whom shall we go? thou have the words of eternal life, John 6.
33, 35, 40, 50, 51, 54, 57, 58, 68. John 5. 24.

I am the door; by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, etc. I am come,
that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly. My
sheep hear my voice, etc. and I give unto them eternal life, and they shall
never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand, John 10. 9, 10,
27, 28.

Because I live, ye shall live also, John 14. 19.

As thou have given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life
to as many as thou have given him, John 17. 2.

These things are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the
Son of God, and that believing ye might have life through his name, John 20. 31.

Why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of his disciples, etc. But we
believe, that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved even
as they, Acts 15. 10, 11.

I send thee (said Christ to Paul) to open their eyes, etc. that they might
receive forgiveness of sins, and an inheritance among them who are sanctified
through faith that is in me, Acts 26. 17, 18.

Being justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him, etc.
much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life, etc. If by one
offense death reigned by one; much more they who receive abundance of grace,
etc. shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ, etc. that as sin has reigned
unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life,
by Jesus Christ our Lord, Romans 5. 9, 10, 17, 21.

The gift of God is eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord, Romans 6. 23.

Whom he justifies, them also he glorifies. What shall we say? etc. Romans 8. 30,
31.

I declare unto you the Gospel, etc. by which also ye are saved, if, etc. 1
Cor. 15. 1, 2, 3.

In Christ, etc. in whom also we have obtained an inheritance, Ephesians. 1. 11.

God who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he has loved us, even
when we were dead in sins, has quickened us together with Christ. By grace are
ye saved, that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his
grace, etc. for by grace are ye saved through faith, etc. not by works, lest
any man should boast, Ephesians. 2. 4, 5, 7, 8, 9.

am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal, and though I have the gift
of prophecy, and understood all mysteries, and all knowledge, and though I have
all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am
nothing: And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give
my body to be burned and have not charity, it profits nothing to me, 1 Cor.
13. 1, 2, 3.

We beholding, etc. the glory of the Lord, etc. are changed into the same
image, etc. by the spirit, 2 Cor. 3. 17, 18.

We having the same spirit of faith according as it is written, I believed, and
therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak, 2 Cor. 4. 13.

In this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house from
heaven, etc. that mortallity might be swallowed up of life. We are willing to
be absent from the body, that we may be present with the Lord, wherefore we
labor, that whether present, etc. we may be accepted of him, etc. knowing
therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men, etc. The love of Christ
constrains us, etc. If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature; old things
are past away, behold all things as become new, 2 Cor. 5. 2, 4, 8, 9, 11, 14,
17.

Jesus Christ is in you, except you be reprobates, etc. We can do nothing
against the truth, but for the truth, 2 Cor. 13. 5, 8.

When it pleased God, etc. to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him,
etc. immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood, Gal. 1. 15, 16.

I am crucified with Christ; nevertheless I live, yet not I, but Christ lives
in me, Gal. 2. 20.

The works of the flesh are manifest, which are adultery, etc. but the fruit of
the spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,
meekness, temperance: and they who are Christ's, have crucified the flesh, with
the affections (or passions) and lusts, Gal. 5. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24.

God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by
whom (or, whereby) the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world: for in
Jesus Christ circumcision avails nothing, etc. but a new creature, Gal. 6.
14, 15.

This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, That ye henceforth walk not as
other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their minds, etc. But ye have not so
learned Christ. If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him as
the truth is in Jesus, Ephesians. 4. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21.

For the fruit of the spirit is in all, goodness, righteousness, and truth,
Ephesians. 5. 9.

Some preach Christ out of envy and strife, etc. what then? notwithstanding in
every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is preached; and therein do
I rejoice, yea and I will rejoice, Phil. 1. 15, 16, 17, 18.

We are the circumcision, who worship God in the spirit, rejoice in Christ
Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh, etc. What things were gain to me,
those I count loss for Christ; yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss
for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, etc. that I might
know him, and the power of his resurrection, etc. and be made conformable unto
his death, if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead;
not as though I had already attained, or were already perfect; but I follow
after, etc. but this one thing, forgetting those things which are behind, and
reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark,
etc. let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded, etc. Our
conversation is in heaven, from whence we look for the Savior, etc. Phil. 3.
3. 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20.

I have learned in whatsoever estate I am, therewith to be content. I know how
to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where, and in all things I am
instructed both to be full, and to be hungry; both to abound, and to suffer
need: I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me, Phil. 4. 11, 12,
13.

And brings forth fruits, as it does also in you since the day ye heard and
knew the grace of God in truth, Col. 1. 6.

If ye be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, etc. Set your
affections on things above, not on things on the earth, etc. seeing that ye
have put off the old man with his deeds, and have put on the new man, which is
renewed in knowledge after the image of him who created him, Colos. 3. 1, 2, 9,
10.

Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labor of love, etc.
knowing, beloved, your election of God. For our Gospel came not unto you in
word only, but also in power, etc. and ye became followers of us, and of the
Lord, having received the word in much affliction, etc. ye turned to God, etc.
to serve the living and true God, and to wait for his Son, 1 These. 1. 3, 4, 5,
6, 9, 10.

The word of God which effectually works also in you who believe: for ye
brethren became followers of the Churches of God, which in Judea are in Christ
Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your own Contrymen, 1. These.
2. 13, 14.

Ye brethren are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief:
ye are the children of the light, etc. 1 These. 5. 4, 5.

I thank Jesus Christ our Lord, who has enabled me, etc. who was before, a
blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious; but I obtained mercy, etc. Jesus
Christ came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the chief, 1 Timothy 1.
12, 13, 15.

Let every one who names the name of Christ, depart from iniquity, 2 Timothy 2.
19.

He who is entered into his rest, has ceased from his own works, Hebr. 4. 10.

They who believe, desire a better country, that is an heavenly, etc. Moses,
etc. choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy
the pleasures of sin for a season; esteeming the reproach of Christ greater
riches than the treasures of Egypt, etc. Heb. 11. 16, 24, 25, 26.

Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the
Lord, Heb. 12. 14.

If any among you seem to be religious, and bridle not his tongue, but
deceives his own heart, this man's religion is vain. Pure religion and
undefiled before God and the Father, is this, To visit the fatherless and
widows in their affliction; to keep himself unspotted from the world, James 1.
26, 27.

What does it profit, my brethren, though a man say he has faith, and have not
works? etc. faith, if it has not works, is dead, etc. I will show thee my
faith by my works, etc. Faith without works is dead also, James 2. 14, 18, 26.

Who is a wise man, and endued with knowledge amongst you? let him show out of a
good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom. But if ye have bitter
envying, etc. this wisdom descends not from above, etc. but the wisdom which
is from above, is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be
entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without
hypocrisy; and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace, etc. James 3. 13,
14 15, 16, 17, 18.

Jesus Christ, whom having not seen, ye love, etc. seeing that you have
purified your souls in obeying the truth, etc. unto unfeigned love of the
brethren, 1 Pet. 1. 8, 22.

As newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word of God, that ye may grow
thereby, if so be ye have tasted, etc. Ye are a chosen generation, etc. that ye
should show forth the virtues (or, praises) of him who has called you, etc. 1
Pet. 2. 2, 9.

The time of our life may suffice, etc. when we walked in lasciviousness, etc.
wherein they think it strange that you run not with them to the same excess of
riot, 1 Pet. 4. 3, 4.

Having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. Add to your
faith virtue, and to virtue knowledge, etc. for if these things be in you, and
abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren and unfruitful in the
knowledge of our Lord Jesus; but he who lacks these things, is blind and
cannot see afar off, etc. 2 Pet. 1. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Just Lot vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked; for that righteous
man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from
day to day with unlawful deeds, 2 Pet. 2. 7, 8.

God is light, etc. if we say we have fellowship with him, and walk in
darkness, we lie, etc. but if we walk in the light, etc. If we say that we have
no sin, we deceive our selves, 1 John 1. 6, 7, 8,

Hereby we know that we know him, if we keep his commandments. He who faith, I
know him, and keeps not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in
him, etc. he who abides in him, ought himself also so to walk, even as he
walked, etc. He who faith he is in the light, and hates his brother, is in
darkness even until now: He who loves his brother, abides in the light, etc.
if any man loves the world, the love of the father is not in him, etc. if ye
know that he is righteous, ye know (or, know ye) that every one who does
righteousness, is born of God, 1 John 2. 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 11, 15, 29.

We shall see him as he is: and every man who has this hope in him, purifieth
himself as he is pure, etc. Whosoever abides in him, sins not, etc. he who
commits sin (or, gives his labor to sin) is of the devil, etc. whosoever
is born of God, does not commit sin, for his seed remains in him, and he
cannot sin because he is born of God. In this the children of God are manifest,
and the children of the devil; whosoever does not righteousness, is not of God;
neither is he who loves not his brother, etc. We know that we have passed from
death to life, because we love the brethren, etc. Whosoever hates his brother,
is a murderer: and ye know, that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him,
etc. Whosoever has this worlds goods, and sees his brother has need, and
shuts up the bowels of his compassion from him, how dwells the love of God
in him? etc. Let us not love in word, neither in tongue, but in deed and in
truth. And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts
before God, etc. And hereby we know that he abides in us by the spirit which
he has given us, 1 John 3. 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 24. Chap.
4. 12.

Love is God; and every one who loves, is born of God, and knows God. If a
man say, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar: for he who loves
not his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen? 1
John 4. 7, 16, 20. chap. 5. 1.

Whosoever is born of God, overcomes the world; and this is the victory that,
etc. Whosoever is born of God, sins not: but he who is begotten of God,
keeps himself, and that wicked one touches him not, 1 John 5. 4, 18.

He who does good, is of God; but he who does evil, has not seen God, 3 John
v. 11.

How should man be just with God (or, before God) If he will contend with him,
he cannot answer him one of a thousand, etc. Whom though I were righteous, yet
would I not answer, I would make supplication to my judge, etc. If I justify
my self, my own mouth shall condemn me. If I say I am perfect, it shall also
prove me perverse, Job 9. 1, 2, 3, 15, 20.

Who can understand his errors? Cleanse thou me from secret faults, keep back

are Jesus Christ's, Phil. 2. 20, 21.

Paul says, I count not my self to have apprehended but this one thing, etc. I
press toward the mark, etc. Let us therefore as many as be perfect, be thus
minded, Phil. 3. 13, 14, 15.

For in many things we offend all: if any man offend not in word, the same is a
perfect man, James 3. 2.

If we say we have no sin, we deceive our selves, and the truth is not in us.

we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us,
John 1. 1, 8, 9, 10.

If any man see his brother sin a sin not unto death, he shall ask, and he
shall give him life for them who sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death:
I do not say that he shall pray for it, 1 John. 5. 16.

Israel is an empty vine, he brings forth fruit unto himself, Hosea 10. 1.

Is it time for you, O ye, to dwell in your ceiled houses, and this house lie

of hosts? because of mine house that is waste; and ye run every man to his own
house, therefore, etc. Haggai 1. 4, 6, 9, 10.

drunkenness, etc. But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision
for the flesh, to fulfill the lusts thereof, Romans 13. 11, 12, 13, 14.

not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him who dyed for them, 2 Cor. 5.
9, 14, 15.

sight of men, 2 Cor. 8. 20.

have not so learned Christ, etc. That ye put off concerning the former
conversation, the old man which is corrupt according to deceitful lusts: And be
renewed in the spirit of your minds; and that ye put on that new man, which
after God, is created in righteousness, and true holiness, Ephesians. 4. 1, 17, 20,
22, 23, 24. Col. 3. 9, 10.

Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children, etc. Ye were sometimes
darkness, but now light in the Lord: Walk as children of the light, etc. Have
no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them,
etc. See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, redeeming the time,
Ephesians. 5. 1, 8, 11, 15, 16.

That ye may approve things which differ (or try things which are excellent)
that ye be sincere, and without offense, till the day of Christ, etc. Being
filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the
glory and praise of God, etc. According to my earnest expection, etc. Christ

conversation be as becomes the Gospel of Christ, Phil. 1. 10, 11, 20, 27.

indifferent to have respect to the meek; to avoid offenoes.
The Pharisees would have accused the disciples for plucking corn, and Christ
for healing a withered hand on the Sabbath day, till he said unto them, Which
of you having one sheep, etc. fall into a pit on the Sabbath day, will he not

day, Matthew. 12. 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 11, 12. Luke 6. 1, 2, etc.

Whosoever shall offend one of these little ones who believe in me, it were

6, 7. Luke 17. 1, 2.

His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is
not good to marry: But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying,

to receive it, let him, Matthew. 19. 10, 11, 12.

Jesus said, I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them
now: howbeit when he, the spirit of truth is come, he will guide, John 16. 12,
13.

Him who is weak receive, but not with doubtful disputations (or, not to judge
his doubtful thoughts): for one believes that he may eat all things; another
who is weak eats herbs: let not him who eats, despise him who eats not;
and let not him who eats not, judge him who eats; for God has received him,
etc. One man esteems one day above another: another esteems every day
alike; let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind; he who observes a
day, observes it to the Lord, etc. Why do thou judge thy brother? why do
thou set at naught thy brother, etc? Let us not therefore judge one another any
more, but judge this rather, that no man put a stumbling block, or an occasion
to fall, in his brothers way. I know, etc. that there is nothing unclean of it
self; but to him who esteems any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean.
And if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walk thou not charitably,
etc. Let us therefore follow after things which make for peace, etc. All things
indeed are pure, but it is evil for that man who eats with offense; it is
good neither to eat flesh, etc. whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended,
or made weak, etc. he who doubts is damned if he eat, etc. for whatsoever is
not of faith, is sin, Romans 14. 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20, 21, 23.

We then who are strong, ought to bear with the infirmities of the weak, and
not to please our selves: let every one of us please his neighbor for his good
to edification, Romans 15. 1, 2, 3.

I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to
^ear it, neither yet now are ye able to bear it, 1 Cor. 3. 1, 2.

All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient (or,
profitable): all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the
power of any, etc. 1 Cor. 6. 12. chap. 10. 23.

I would that all men were even as I my self: but every man has his proper
gift of God; one after this manner, etc. Is any man called being circumcised?
let him not become uncircumcised; and is any called in uncircumcision? let him
not be circumcised; Circumcision is nothing, etc. 1 Cor. 7. 7, 18, 19.

We know that an Idol is nothing in the world, etc. howbeit, there is not in
every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the Idol unto this hour,
eat it as a thing offered to Idols, and their conscience being weak, is
defiled. But meat commends us not to God, etc. Take heed lest by any means
this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to them who are weak: for if any
man see thee who have knowledge sit at meat in the Idols temple, shall not the
conscience of him which is weak, be emboldned to eat those things which are
offered to Idols, and through thy knowledge shall thy weak brother perish for
whom Christ died? but when ye sin so against the weak brethren, and wound their
weak conscience, ye sin against Christ; wherefore, if meat make my brother to
offend, I will eat no flesh while the world stands, lest I make my brother to
offend, 1 Cor. 8. 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.

For though I be free from all men, yet have I made my self a servant unto all,
that I might gain the more: and unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might
gain the Jew, etc. To the weak became I as weak, etc. I am made all things unto
all men, that I might by all means save some, etc. 1 Cor. 9. 19, 20, 21, 22.

All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient, etc. all
things edify not: let no man seek his own, but every man another wealth:
whatsoever is sold in the shambles, that eat, asking no question for conscience
sake, for the earth is the Lords, etc. If any of them who believe not, bid you,
and ye be disposed to go, whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question
for conscience sake. But if any man say unto thee, this is offered in sacrifice
unto Idols: eat not for his sake who showed it, and for conscience sake, etc.
conscience, I say; not thine own, but of the others, etc. Give none offense,
neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the Church of God; even as I
please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of
many that they may be saved, 1 Cor. 10. 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31, 32, 33.
chap. 11. 1.

Charity seeks not her own, 1 Cor. 13. 4, 5.

Let all your things be done with charity, 1 Cor. 16. 14.

Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of
others: let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus, Phil. 2. 4, 5.

Let us therefore as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye
be otherwise-minded, God shall reveal even this unto you. Nevertheless,
whereunto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind
the same thing, Phil. 3. 15, 16.

Let no man therefore judge you, in meat or in drink (or, in eating or in
drinking) or in respect of an holy day, or of the new moon, or of the Sabbath,
which are a shadow of things to come: but the body is of Christ, Col. 2. 16, 17.

We exhort you brethren, etc. comfort the feeble minded, support the weak, be
patient toward all men, 1 These. 5. 14.

Neither give heed to fables, etc. which minister questions rather than godly
edifying, which is in faith: now the end of the commandment is charity, etc. 1 Timothy 1. 4, 5.

Some shall depart from the faith, etc. forbidding to marry, and commanding to
abstain from meats, which God has created to be received, etc. 1 Timothy 4. 3, 4,
5.

Unto the pure all things are pure, Tit. 1. 15.

When Paul was writing many things concerning Christ, he said, Of whom we have
many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye are dull of hearing, etc.
ye are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat, etc. strong
meat belongs unto them who are of full age, Heb. 5. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

It is a good thing that the heart be established with grace, not with meats
which have not profited them who have been occupied therein, Heb. 13. 9.

till I come, Rev. 2. 24, 25.

When ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shall not wholly reap the corners
of thy fields, neither shall thou gather the gleanings of thy harvest. And thou
shall not glean thy vineyard, etc. Thou shall leave them for the poor and the
stranger. I am the Lord your God, Lev. 19. 9, 10.

If there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethen, within any of thy
gates, etc. thou shall not harden thine heart, nor shut thine hand against thy
poor brother: but thou shall open thine hand wide unto him, and shall surely
lend him sufficient for his need, in that which he wants. Beware that there
be not a thought (or, word) in thy wicked heart, saying, The seventh year, the
year of release, is at hand, and thine eye be evil against thy brother, and
thou give him naught, and he cry unto the Lord against thee, and it be sin
unto thee: thou shall surely give him, and thine heart shall not be grieved
when thou give unto him: because that for this thing the Lord thy God shall
bless thee in all thy work, etc. for the poor shall never cease out of the
land: therefore I command thee, etc. Deuteronomy. 15. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

alone, and the fatherless have not eaten thereof, etc. If I have seen any

the poor, Prove. 22. 9.

portion to seven, and also to eight, etc. Eccles. 11. 1, 2, 3.

Is not this the fast that I have chosen, etc? Is it not to deal thy bread to

do, etc. that they may have glory of men, etc. But when thou do thine alms,
let not thy left hand know what thy right hand does, Mat. 6. 1, 2, 3.

Ask, and it shall be given you, Mat. 7. 7.

water only, in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, He shall in no
wise lose his reward, Mat. 10. 42. Mark 9. 41.

Christ shall say, I was an hungry, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye

stand related one to another in the flesh.

AND the Lord said, It is not good that the man should be alone: I will make
him a help meet for him, etc. Adam said, This is now bone of my bone, and flesh

causes her to commit adultery; and whosoever shall marry her who is divorced,
commits adultery, Mat. 5. 31, 32. chapter 19. 9.

The Pharisees said, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every
cause? And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he who made
them at the beginning, made them male and female, etc. Wherefore they are no

So then, if while her husband lives, she be married to another man, she shall
be called an adultress: but if her husband be dead, etc. Romans 7. 2, 3.

It is good for a man not to touch a woman: nevertheless to avoid fornication,
let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband. Let
the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife
unto the husband. The wife has not power over her own body, but the husband:
and likewise also the husband has not power of his, but the wife. Defraud you
not one the other, except with consent for a time; that you may give your
selves to fasting and to prayer, and come together again, that Satan tempt you
not, for your incontinency, etc.. I say to the unmarried and widows, it is good
for them, if they abide even as I. But if they cannot contain, let them marry:
for it is better to marry than to burn. And unto the married, I command, not I,
but the Lord; Let not the wife depart from the husband: but if she depart, let
her remain unmarried, etc. Let not the husband depart from his wife, etc. And
if any brother has a wife who believes not, and she be pleased to dwell with
him, let him not put her away, etc. for the unbelieving husband is sanctified

Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other Apostles,
and the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas? 1 Cor. 9. 5.

The head of the woman is the man, etc. The man is not of the woman, but the
woman of the man. Neither was the man created for the woman: but the woman for
the man, etc. Nevertheless, neither is the man without the woman, neither is
the woman without the man, in the Lord: for as the woman is of the man, even so
is the man also by the woman, etc. 1 Cor. 11. 3, 8, 9, 11, 12.

Let your women keep silence in the Churches: for it is not permitted to them
to speak, but to be under obedience, as also says the law. And if they will

Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship has
righteousness with unrighteousness? 2 Cor. 6. 14.

Wives, submit your selves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord: For the
husband is the head of the wife, etc. therefore as the Church is subject to
Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing. Husbands,
love your wives, even as Christ also Ioved the Church, etc. So ought men to
love their wives as their own bodies: he who loves his wife, loves himself:
for no man ever yet hated his own flesh, etc. Let every one of you in
particular so love his wife, even as himself: and the wife see that she
reverence her husband, Ephesians. 5. 22, 23, 24, 25, 28, 33.

Wives submit your selves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.
Husbands love your wives, and be not bitter against them, Col. 3. 18, 19.

the women learn in silence with all subjection: But I suffer not a woman to
teach, or usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence. For Adam was
first formed, then Eve: and Adam was not deceived, etc. 1 Timothy, 2. 9, 10, 11,
12, 13, 14.

I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house,
give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully, 1 Timothy 5. 14.

and as being heirs together of the grace of life, that your prayers be not
hindered, 1 Pet. 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

2dly, More especially, the Saints, Believers, such as are born of the Spirit.

etc. The desciple is not above his master, etc. It is enough for the disciple

If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you. If ye

world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.
Remember the word I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his Lord: if
they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you, etc. These things they
will do unto you for my names sake, because they know not him who sent me, John
15. 18, 19, 20, 21. 1 John 3. 13.

These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended: But they

12.

Whom the Lord loves, he chasteneth, etc. for what son is he whom the father
chasteneth not? but if ye be without chastisements, whereof all are partakers,
then are ye bastards, and not sons, Heb. 12. 6, 7, 8.

Think it not strange concerning the fiery trial, etc. as though some strange
thing happened to you: but rejoice, in as much as ye are made partakers of
Christ's sufferings: judgment must begin at the house of God, 1 Pet. 4. 12, 13,
17.

against me, Job 6. 1, 2, 3, 4.

the floods overflow me: I am weary of my crying: my throat is dry: mine eyes
fail, while I wait for my God, Psalm. 69. 1, 2, 3.

In the day of my trouble, I sought the Lord; my sore ran in the night, and
ceased not! my soul refused to be comforted: I remembered God, and was
troubled; I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed, Selah. Thou hold mine
eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak, etc. Will the Lord cast off
for ever? will he be favorable no more? Is his mercy clean gone for ever? does
his promise fail? Psalm. 77. 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8.

My soul is full of troubles, etc. Thou have laid me in the lowest pit, in

wisely with them, lest they multiply: and it come to pass, when there fall out

lives bitter with hard bondage, etc. ordered the Midwives to kill the

Not rendering evil for evil, or railing, etc. 1 Pet. 3. 9.

but exhorting one another, Heb. 10. 24, 25.

My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory,
with respect of persons: for if there come into your assembly (or, Synagogue) a
man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel; and there come in also a poor man in
vile raiment, and ye have respect unto him who wears the gay clothing, and
say unto him, sit thou here in a good place: and say unto the poor, stand thou
there; or, sit here under my footstool; are you not then partial, etc? has not
God chosen the poor of this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom,
etc? If ye fulfill the royal law, etc. thou shall love thy neighbor as thy
self, ye do well: but if ye respect persons, ye commit sin, James 2. 1, 2, 3,

28, 29.

who is not against us, is on our part, Mark 9. 38, 39, 40.

The Jews used to have such speak in their Synagogue, who were not either
Priests, or other officers, as appears in these instances, Luke 4. 16, 17, 18,
19, 20, 21. Acts 13. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. chap. 17. 1, 2, 3.

There was a great persecution against the Church which was at Jerusalem: and
they were all scattered abroad, etc. except the Apostles, etc. therefore they
who were scattered abroad, went everywhere preaching the word, Acts 8. 1, 4.

the Grecians, preaching the Lord Jesus, and the hand of the Lord was with them:
and a great number believed, and turned unto the Lord, Acts 11. 19, 20, 21.

Apollos, an eloquent man, and mighty in the Scriptures, etc. he taught
diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John, etc. who
when Aquilla and Priscilla had taught the way of God more perfectly, did
mightily convince the Jews, and that publicly, showing by the Scriptures, that
Jesus was Christ, Acts 18. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28.

Think soberly, according as God has dealt to every man the measure of faith.

office: So we being many, etc. Having then gifts differing, according to the
grace which is given to us, whether prophecy let us prophecy, according to the
proportion of faith, etc. Or he that teaches, on teaching: or he who
exhorts, on exhortation, etc. he who rules, with diligence, Romans 12. 3, 4,

goodness, filled with knowledge, able also to admonish one another, Romans 15. 14.

I thank my God, etc. that in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all
utterance, and in all knowledge, 1 Cor. 1. 4, 5.

Now there are diversity of gifts, but the same spirit, etc. But the
manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit withal. For to one
is given by the spirit the word of wisdom, to another the word of knowledge,
etc. To another faith, etc. to another prophecy, etc. But all these works
that one and the self-same spirit, dividing to every man severally, as he will,
etc. If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body,
etc. God has set the members every one of them in the body, as it has pleased
him, etc. Are all Apostles, etc? Have all the gift of healing? do all speak
with tongues, etc? But covet earnestly the best gifts, 1 Cor. 12. 4, 7, 8, 9,
11, 15, 18, 28, 29, 30, 31.

Desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophecy, etc. He who
prophesies, speaks unto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort,
etc. He edifieth the Church, etc. Forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual
gifts, seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the Church, etc. If all
prophecy, and there come in one that believes not, etc. he is convinced of
all, etc. will report that God is in you of a truth. How is it, brethren, that
when ye come together, every one of you has a psalm, etc. let all things be
done to edifying, etc. Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other
judge. If any thing be revealed to another who sits by, let the first hold
his peace. For ye may all prophecy one by one, that all may learn, and all may
be comforted. And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets. For
God, etc. Let your women keep silence in the Churches, etc. Wherefore brethren,
covet to prophecy, etc. Let all things be done decently, and in order, 1 Cor.
14. 1, 3, 4, 5, 12, 23, 24, 25, 26, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 39, 40.

We also believe, therefore speak, 2 Cor. 4. 13.

As ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, 2 Cor. 8.
7.

Many of the brethren of the Lord waxing confident by my bonds, are much more
bold to speak the word, etc. Some preach Christ out of envy, etc. What then,
etc? Christ is preached, and I therein do rejoice, etc. Phil. 1. 14, 15, 16,
17, 18.

Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, in all wisdom, teaching and
admonishing one another, Col. 3. 16.

Comfort (or, exhort) one another, with these words, 1 Thessalonians. 4. 18.

Wherefore comfort your selves together, and edify one another, even as also
ye do, 1 Thessalonians. 5. 11.

Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief,
etc. But exhort one another daily, etc. lest any of you be hardened through the
deceitfulness of sin, Heb. 3. 12, 13.

For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you
again, which be the first principles of the oracles of God, Heb. 5. 12.

Let us consider one another, etc. not forsaking the assembling of our selves
together, as-the manner of some is, but exhorting one another; and so much the,
etc. Heb. 10. 24, 25.

As every man has received the gift, even so minister the same one to another,
as good stewards of the manifold grace of God. If any man speak, let him speak
as the oracles of God: if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability
which God gives, that God in all things may be glorified, 1 Pet. 4. 10, 11.

Church which was in Jerusalem: they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as

were received by the Church, and of the Apostles, etc. All the multitude kept
silence, and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, etc. Then James spoke, etc.
Then pleased it the Apostles and elders, with the whole Church, to send chosen
men of their own company to Antioch, etc. and wrote letters by them after this
manner: The Apostles, Elders, and Brethren, send greeting unto the brethren
which are, etc. It seems good to us, being assembled with one accord, to send
chosen men unto you, etc. it seems good to the holy Ghost, and to us, etc. They
came to Antioch, and when they had gathered the multitude together, they

country, and charges each Church with its own guilt, and commends each Church

Of the ending of controversies arising between the members of the Churches, to
avoid going to law before others.
Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust,
and not before the Saints? do ye not know, that the Saints shall judge the
world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the
smallest matters? know ye not, that we shall judge Angels? how much more, things
which pertain to this life, etc? Set them to judge who are least esteemed in the
Church. I speak to your shame, Is it so that there is not a wise man among you?
no, not one who shall be able to judge between his brethren; but brother goes
to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers? Now therefore, there is
utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another: why do ye not
rather take wrong? etc. 1 Cor. 6. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

Lord, that thou fulfill it, Col. 4. 17.

must be blameless, the husband of one wife: vigilant, sober, of good behavior
(or, modest); given to hospitality, apt to teach; not given to wine, no
striker, nor greedy of filthy lucre, but patient: not a brawler, not covetous:
one who rules well his own house, having his children in subjection with all
gravity: for if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take
care of the Church of God? not a novice, (or, one newly come to the faith),
lest being lifted up with pride, he fall into the condemnation of the Devil.
Likewise must the Deacons be grave, not double-tongued, not given to much wine,
not greedy of filthy lucre, holding the mystery of faith in a pure conscience;
let these also first be proved, then let them use the office, etc. husband of
one wife, ruling their children well, and their own house, 1 Timothy 3. 1, 2, 3,

lucre, but a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy,
temperate; holding fast the faithful word, as he has been taught: that he may

flock, 1 Pet. 5. 4, 2, 3, 4.

Complaints of, and threatenings against evil Officers, or Ministers of the
Church.
His watchmen are blind, they are all ignorant, they are all dumb dogs: they
cannot bark, sleeping, ly^ng down, loving to slumber: yea, they are greedy dogs
who can never have enough, and they are shepherds who cannot understand: they

to morrow shall be as to day, Isa. 56. 10, 11, 12.

then, faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God, Romans 10. 14, 15,
17.

you shall be circumcised, etc. and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt

when he was circumcised, Genesis 17. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 23, 24, 25.

etc. they went down into the water, and he baptized him, Acts 8. 12, 13, 36,
37, 38.

Saul arose, and was baptized, Acts 9. 18.

Can any man forbid water that these should not be baptized, who have received

etc. Acts 10. 47, 48.

Leaving the principles, etc. of the doctrine of Baptisms, Heb. 6. 1, 2.

The ark wherein few, etc. were saved by water: the like figure whereunto even
baptism does also now save us: not the putting away of the filth of the flesh,
but the answer of a good conscience toward God, by the resurrection of Jesus
Christ, 1 Pet. 3. 20, 21.

4thly, Breaking of bread, or the Lords Supper.
The Passover instituted: and all the directions about it, Exodus 12.

The people not prepared, yet did eat: Hezekiah prayed for them, 2 Chr. 30. 18,
19.

As they were eating, Jesus took bread and blessed it, and brake it, and gave
it to his disciples, and said, Take, eat, this is my body: and he took the cup
and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it, for this is
my blood of the new Testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins:
but he said unto them, I will not drink it henceforth, etc. and when they had
sung, etc. Matthew. 26. 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.

They all drank of the cup, Mark 14. 23.

He sat down, and the twelve Apostles with him, etc. He took the cup and gave
thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among your selves, etc. And he took
bread and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my
body which is given for you, this do in remembrance of me. Likewise also the
cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new Testament in my blood, which is
shed for you, Luke 22. 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.

When Judas had received the sop at supper, he went immediately out, John 13.
26, 30.

And they continued steadfastly, etc. in breaking of bread, Acts 2. 42.

Upon the first day of the week when the disciples came together to break
bread, etc. Paul preached to them, etc. in the upper chamber where they were
gathered together, etc. When he therefore was come up again, and had broken
bread, etc. Acts 20. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, etc. let us
keep the feast, not with old leaven, etc. but with the unleavened bread of
sincerity, 1 Cor. 5. 7, 8.

The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the comunion of the blood of
Christ? the bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of
Christ? for we being many, are one bread and one body: for we are all partakers
of that one bread, etc. ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of
devils: ye cannot, etc. 1 Cor. 10. 16, 17, 21, 22.

When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lords
supper (or, ye cannot eat): for in eating, every one takes before other his
own supper; and one is hungry, and another is drunken: what, have ye not houses
to eat and to drink in? or despise you the Church of God, and shame them that
have not (or, are poor)? for I have received of the Lord that which also I
delivered unto you, that the the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was
betrayed, took bread, and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said,
Take, eat, this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in (or, for a)
remembrance of me. After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had
supped, saying, This cup is thenew Testament in my blood, this do ye, as often
as ye drink it, in remembrance of me: for as often as ye eat this bread, and
drink this cup, ye do show (or, show ye) the Lords death till he come:
wherefore, whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord
unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord, etc. he who
eats, etc. unworthily, eats and drinks damnation to himself, not
discerning the Lords body, etc. When ye come together to eat, tarry one for
another: and if any man hunger, let him eat at home, 1 Cor. 11. 17, 20, 21, 22,
23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29, 33, 34.

5thly, Discipline, Church Censures, or removing of Scandals.
If a soul fin, and hear the voice of swearing, and is a witness whether he
has seen or known of it: if he do not utter it, then shall he bear his
iniquity, Levit. 5. 1.

If there were a leper in the camp of Israel, he was to be pronounced unclean,
and his habitation without the camp alone, Levit. 13. 44, 46.

When he was to be brought into the camp again, he was first to be pronounced
clean by the Priest, after he had viewed him and offered sacrifices for him,
and performed other things: so for other uncleanness, they were to be
separated from the congregation, etc. and so brought in again, Levit. 14. 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, etc. chap. 15. Matthew. 8. 4.

gives of his seed unto Molech, and kill him not: then I will set my face

The Priests or people who were unclean, etc. by any uncleanness, were not to
eat or touch the holy things, that they might not profane the holy name of the
Lord; if they did before they were cleansed, they were to be cut off from the
presence of God: no stranger was to eat of the holy thing, Levit. 22. 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14, 15.

Put out of the camp every leper, and every one who has an issue, etc. both
male and female shall ye put out, etc. that they defile not their camp in the
midst whereof I dwell: and the children of Israel did so, etc. Numb. 5. 1, 2,
3, 4. Deuteronomy. 23. 14.

out from thence, etc. he dwelt in a several house, being a leper: for he was
cut off from the house of the Lord, 2 Chronicles. 26. 19, 20, 21.

The people of Israel, the Priests and the Levites, have not separated
themselves from the people of the land, etc. for they have taken of their
daughters, etc. so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people,
etc. yea, the hand of the princes and rulers has been chief in this trespass,
etc. Ezra 9. 1, 2.

They read in the book of Moses, etc. that the Ammonite, etc. should not come
into the congregation of God for ever, etc. Now it came to pass, when they had
heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude, Nehem.

He who spares his rod, hates his son: but he who loves him, etc. Prove. 13.
24.

Debate thy cause with thy neighbor himself: and discover not a secret to
another (or, the secret of another), Prove. 25. 9.

Open rebuke is better than secret love, Prove. 27. 5.

If thou take forth the precious from the vile: thou shall be as my mouth, Jer.
15. 19.

Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy things: they
have put no difference between the holy and profane: neither have they showed
difference between the unclean and the clean, Ezekiel. 22. 26.

They shall teach my people the difference between the holy and profane, and
cause men to discern between the unclean and the clean, Ezekiel. 44. 23.

Ephraim has mixed himself among the people, etc. a cake not turned, Hosea 7.
8.

Jesus said unto Peter, etc. I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of
heaven: and whatsoever thou shall bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven:
whatsoever thou shall loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven, Matthew. 16. 18,
19.

If thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between
him and thee: if he will hear thee, thou shall gain thy brother: but if he will
not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or
three witnesses every word may be established: and if he shall neglect to hear
them, tell it to the Church: but if he neglect to hear the Church, let him be
unto thee as an heathen man and a publican; verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever
ye shall bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever ye shall loose
on earth, etc. Matthew. 18. 15, 16, 17, 18. John 20. 21, 22, 23.

if seven times a day, Luke 17. 3, 4.

I beseech you brethren, mark them who cause divisions and offenses contrary to
the doctrine which ye bave learned, and avoid them: for they are such who serve
not our Lord Jesus, but their own bellies, etc. Romans 16. 17, 18.

It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such, etc.
and ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he who has done this
deed, might have been taken away from among you, etc. In the name of our Lord
Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of
our Lord Jesus, to deliver such a one unto Satan for the destruction of the
flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus, etc. know ye
not that a little leaven leavens the whole lump, etc? I wrote to you in an
Epistle, not to keep company with fornicators, yet not altogether with the
fornicators of this world, etc. But if any man that is called a brother, be a
fornicator, or covetous, or an idolator, etc. with such a one, no not to eat:
for what have I to do with them who are without? do not ye judge them who are
within, etc? therefore put away from among your selves that wicked person, 1
Cor. 5.

Sufficient to such a man was this punishment (or, censure) which was inflicted
of many: so that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him,

whom ye forgive any thing, I also forgive, 2 Cor. 2. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

14, 15, 16, 17, 18.

When Paul had written to the Galatians about some who troubled them, and would
pervert the Gospel of Christ, etc. had preached the circumcision, etc. he said
to them, Ye did run well, who did hinder you that that ye should not obey the
truth? this persuasion comes not from him who calls you: a little leaven
leaveneth the whole lump: I have confidence in you through the Lord, that you
will be none otherwise minded: but he who troubles you shall bear his
judgment, whosoever he be, etc. I would they were even cut off who trouble you:
for brethren, ye have been called to liberty, Gal. 1. 6, 7, 8. Gal. 5. 7, 8, 9,
10, 11, 12, 13.

14.

Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus, that ye withdraw
your selves from every brother who walks disorderly, and not after the
traditions which he received of us: for your selves know how ye ought to follow
us, etc. If any man obey not our word by this Epistle, note (or, signify) that

an enemy, but admonish him as a brother, 2 Thessalonians. 3. 6, 7, 14, 15.

Rebuke not an Elder, but entreat him as a father, and the younger men as
brethren: the elder women as mothers, the younger as sisters, with all purity,
etc. Against an Elder receive not an accusation, but before (or, under) two or
three witnesses: them who sin, rebuke before all, that others also may fear, 1 Timothy 5. 1, 2, 19, 20.

Men of corrupt minds, etc. from such withdraw thy self, 1 Timothy 6. 5. 2 Timothy 3.
5.

A man who is an heretic, after the first and second admonition reject,
knowing, that he who is such, is subverted and sins, being condemned of
himself, Tit. 3. 10, 11.

fail (or, fall from) the grace of God: lest any root of bitterness springing
up, trouble you, and thereby many be defiled: lest there be any fornicator or
profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel, etc. Heb. 12. 14, 15, 16.

have tried them who say they are Apostles, and are not, and thou have found
them liars, etc. The Church in Pergamus, etc. I have a few things against thee,
because thou have there them who hold the doctrine of Balaam, etc. So also have
thou them who hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate, etc.

suffer that woman Jezebel, who calls her self a prophetess, to teach and
to seduce my servants, to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed to
idols, etc. All the Churches shall know that I am he who searches the heart,
etc. Revel. 2. 2, 14, 15, 20, 23.

See Rebuke and Reproof, Chap. 17.

CHAP. XXVIII. Of Hypocrites and Hypocrisy: The spirits and practices of such
who are very formal and earnest in the external part of worship and profession,
and in a show for God, yet high in their opposition of Christ, the truth of the
Gospel, and power of Godliness in others.
THE hour comes, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the
father in spirit and in truth: for the father seeks such to worship him. God
is a spirit, and they who worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth,

They are not all Israel who are of Israel: neither because they are the seed
of Abraham, are all children, etc. Romans 9. 6, 7.

and another were consumed with fire, yet he sent again, 2 Kings 1. 3, 4, 8, 9,
10, 11, 12, 13.

Jehu met Jehonadab, and said unto him, Is thine heart right as my heart, etc?

heed to walk in the law of the Lord God of Israel with all his heart: he
departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, etc. 2 Kings 10. 15, 16, 25, 26, 27,
29, 31.

Almighty? will he always call upon God? Job 27. 8, 10.

The hypocrites in heart, etc. they cry not when he binds them, Job 36. 13.

They speak vanity every one with his neighbor: with flattering lips, and with
a double heart do they speak, Psalm. 12. 2.

When he slew them, then they sought him early: and they returned and enquired
early after God, and they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God
their redeemer; nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they
lied unto him with their tongue: for their heart was not right with him,
neither were they steadfast in his covenant, Psalm. 78,. 34, 35, 36, 37.

The way of a fool is right in his own eyes, Prove. 12. 15.

Show my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins: yet

righteousness, and forsook not the ordinances of their God; they ask of me the
ordinances of justice; they take delight in approaching to God: Wherefore have
we fasted, say they, and thou see it not? have we afflicted our soul, and

and exact all your labors, etc. ye fast for strife, etc. Isa. 58. 1. 2, 3, 4.

the beam that is in thine own eye? or, how will thou say to thy brother, Let me
pull out the mote out of thine eye, and behold a beam in thine own eye? thou
hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye, etc. Not every one who

transgress the commandment by your traditions? for God commanded, saying,
Honor thy father, etc. but ye say, etc. thus have ye made the commandment of
God of none effect by your tradition: ye hypocrites, well did Isaias prophecy
of you, saying, This people draw nigh to me with their mouth, etc. but their
heart is far from me, Matthew. 15. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Priests and the Elders, etc. came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By

heard this parable, they perceived that he spoke of them: but when they sought
to lay hands on him, etc. Matthew. 21. 15, 23, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 45, 46.

talk, etc. asked him, Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not, etc? Jesus

The Scribes and Pharisees, etc. they say, and do not: for they bind heavy

move them with one of their fingers: but all their works they do for to be seen
of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their
garments, and love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the
Synagogues, and greetings in the markets, and to be called of men Rabbi, Rabbi,

of heaven against men: for ye neither go in your selves, neither suffer ye them
who are entering, to go in, etc. Ye devour widows houses, and for a pretense
make long prayers, etc. Ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when
he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell, etc. Blind guides! who

released Jesus); they said, Let his blood be upon us and our children, etc.
They mocked him, and said, He trusted in God, let him deliver him now, etc. and

said, etc. That deceiver said, etc. desired, and set a watch upon the
sepulcher, Matthew. 27. 3, 4, 17, 18, 19, 20, 24, 25, 41, 42, 43, 53, 54, 62, 63,

like this man; then answered them the pharisees, Are ye also deceived? have any
of the rulers or pharisees believed on him? but this people who knows not the
law, are accursed. Nicodemus said, etc. Does our law judge any man before it

have a devil, John 8. 33, 34, 40, 41, 48.

The Pharisees said, This man is not of God, because he keeps not the

he was Christ, he should be put out of the Synagogue, etc. They say of Christ,
he is a sinner, we are Moses disciples: as for this fellow we know not whence
he is, etc. When they were convinced by the man who had been blind, that Christ

counsel together to put him to death, John 11. 44, 46, 47, 48, 53, 57.

Judas said, Why was not this ointment sold, etc. and given to the poor? this
he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief and had the
bag, etc. The chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to
death, because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away and believed on
Jesus, etc. The pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye
prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him, etc. Among the chief
rulers also many believed on him: but because of the pharisees they did not
confess him, lest they should be put out of the Synagogue: for they loved the
praise of men more than the praise of God, John 12. 5, 6, 10, 11, 19, 42, 43.

name do ye this, etc? They said, What shall we do with these men? for that
indeed a notable miracle has been done by them, is manifest to all, etc. and

straightly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name; and
they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all, etc. Acts 4. 1, 2, 3,

common prison, etc. they doubted whither these things would grow, etc. said to
the Apostles, Ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring
this man's blood upon us, etc. When the Apostles had said, That God had exalted
that Jesus whom they slew, they were cut to the heart, and took counsel to slay
them, Acts 5. 1, 2, 3, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 24, 28, 30, 31, 33. chap. 7. 54, 55.

of the City, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled
them, etc. Acts 13. 44, 45, 49, 50.

The unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds evilly
affected against the brethren, etc. persuaded the people to stone them, Acts
14. 2, 19.

When Paul had preached, and many believed; the Jews who believed not, moved
with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered
a company, and set all the City in an uproar, etc. they drew Jason and certain
brethren unto the rulers of the City, crying, These have turned the world
upside down, etc. these do all contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying, That

the people, Acts 17. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 13.

and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a
ringleader of the sect of the Nazarens: who also has gone about to profane
the temple, etc. When Paul reasoned of righteousness, etc. Felix trembled, and
answered, Go thy way for this time: when I have a convenient time I will call
for thee, etc. Acts 24. 1, 2, 5, 6, 15.

Paul said, I verily thought with my self, that I ought to do many things
contrary to the name of Jesus, etc. which thing I also did, etc. exceeding mad,

against, Acts 28. 21.

Behold, thou art called a Jew and restest in the law, and make thy boast of
God, and know his will, etc. and art confident that thou thy self art a
guide to the blind, etc. Thou therefore who teach another, teach thou not
thy self? Thou who preachest a man shall not steal, do thou steal, etc? He is
not a Jew who is one outwardly: neither is that circumcision which is outward
in the flesh, etc. Romans 2. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 28.

When Josiah had heard the words of the book of the law, that he rent his
clothes, etc. and he commanded, etc. Go and enquire of the Lord for me, and for
the people, etc. for great is the wrath of the Lord, etc. Tell the man that
sent you to me, etc. I will bring evil upon this place, etc. But to the king,
etc. because thine heart was tender, and thou have humbled thy self, etc. thine
eyes shall not see all the evil, etc. 2 Kings 22. 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19,
20.

I will not remove mine integrity, etc. my heart shall not reproach me so long
as I live, Job 27. 5, 6.

Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said, etc.
what shall we do? Acts 2. 37.

Paul said, etc. I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day,
Acts 23. 1.

And herein do I exercise my self, to have always a conscience void of offense
toward God and toward man, Acts 24. 16.

Which show the work of the law written in their hearts: their conscience also
bearing them witness (or, the conscience witnessing with them): and their
thoughts the mean while (or, between themselves) accusing or else excusing one
another, Romans 2. 15, 16.

I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in
the holy Ghost, Romans 9. 1.

Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but for conscience
sake, Romans 13. 5.

Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, eat, asking no question for
conscience sake: for the earth is the Lords, etc. If any of them who believe
not, bid you, etc. whatsoever is before you, eat, asking no queston for
conscience sake; but if any man say unto thee, this is offered to idols; eat
not for his sake, etc. and for conscience sake, etc. Conscience, I say, not
thine own, but of the others: for why is my liberty judged of another man's
conscience, etc? Give none offense, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles,
nor to the Church of God, 1 Cor. 10. 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 32. chap. 8. 7.

Our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and
godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, etc. 2 Cor. 1. 12.

in the sight of God, 2 Cor. 4. 2.

We are made manifest unto God; and I trust also, are made manifest in your
consciences, 2 Cor. 5. 11.

Now the end of the commandment is charity, out of a pure heart, and of a good
conscience, etc. holding faith and a good conscience: which some having put
away, concerning faith have made shipwreck, 1 Timothy 1. 5. 19.

Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience, 1 Timothy 3. 9.

The Spirit speaks expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from
the faith, etc. speaking lies in hypocrisy: having their conscience feared
with a hot iron, forbidding to marry, etc. 1 Timothy 4. 1, 2, 3.

I thank God, whom I serve, etc. with pure conscience, 2 Timothy 1, 3.

Unto them who are defiled and unbelieving, is nothing pure: but even their
mind and conscience is defiled, Titus 1. 15.

In which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, which could not make him who
did the service, perfect as pertaining to the conscience, etc. If the blood of
bulls and goats, sanctifies to the purifying of the flesh: how much more shall
the blood of Christ, etc. purge your conscience from dead works to serve the
living God? Heb. 9. 9, 13, 14.

The law having a shadow of good things, etc. can never with those sacrifices
they offered year by year continually, make the comers thereunto perfect: then
would they not have ceased to be offered, because that the worshippers once
purged, should have had no more conscience of sins; but in those sacrifices
there is a remembrance, etc. Let us draw-near, etc. having our hearts sprinkled
from an evil conscience, etc. Heb. 10. 1, 2, 3, 22.

We trust we have a good conscience in all things, willing to live honestly,
Heb. 13. 18.

This is thank-worthy, if a man for conscience toward God, endure grief,
suffering wrongfully, 1 Pet. 2. 19.

Having a good conscience, that whereas they speak evil of you, etc. Baptism
does also now save us: not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the
answer of a good conscience toward God, by the resurrection of Jesus, 1 Pet.
3. 16, 21.

Let us not love in word, etc. Hereby we know, etc. for if our heart condemn
us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things: beloved, if our
heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God, 1 John 3. 13, 19,
20, 21.

CHAP. XXX. Of the Devil, of his subtilty, wiles and ways, by himself, and in
and by his instruments, wicked men, false-teachers, deceivers and seducers. The
description of them, and what concerns the Saints therein.
First, Of Satan, the Devil himself.
NOW the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field, which the Lord
God had made: and he said unto the woman, yea, because (or, has) God said, Ye
shall not eat of every tree of the garden? the woman said, etc. We may eat,
etc. but of the fruit of the tree in the midst of the garden, God has said, Ye
shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, left ye die. And the serpent
said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die; for God does know, that in the
day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be open, and ye shall be as gods
knowing good and evil: and the woman saw that the tree was good, Genesis 3. 1. 2,
3, 4, 5, 6.

And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel, 1 Chronicles. 21. 1.

Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the
Lord: and Satan (or, the adversary) came also among (or, in the midst) of them,
etc. The Lord said to Satan, From whence come thou? then said he, etc. from
going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it, etc. He
said, Does Job serve God for naught? have thou not made a hedge about him, etc?
put forth thine hand, and touch that which he has, and he will curse thee to
thy face, etc. then Satan having leave given him, destroyed all he had, Job. 1.
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, to the end. chap. 2. 1, 2, 3.

Have thou considered my servant Job, etc? still he holds fast his integrity,
although thou movedst me against him to destroy him without a cause. And Satan
answered the Lord, and said, Skin for skin, yea, and all that a man has, will
he give for his life: but put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his
flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face; and the Lord said, He is in thine
hand, but (or, only) save his life. So went Satan, etc. and smote Job, Job 2.
3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

And he showed me Joshua the High Priest standing before the Angel of the Lord,
and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him. And the Lord said unto
Satan, The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan: even the Lord who has chosen, etc.
Zechar. 3. 1, 2.

Jesus, etc. in the wilderness to be tempted of the devil: when he had fasted,
etc. the tempter came to him; he said, If thou be the son of God, command that
these stones be made bread? But he answered and said, It is written, etc. Then
the devil takes him, etc. and sets him on a pinnacle of the temple, and
says unto him, If thou be the son of God, cast thy self down; for it is
written, He shall give his Angels charge, etc. Jesus said, It is written again,
etc. The devil, etc. shows him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of
them, and says unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou will fall
down and worship me, etc. Get thee hence, Satan, for it is written, Thou shall
worship the Lord thy God, and him only shall thou serve, Matthew. 4. 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

When Jesus was come on the other side, etc. there met him two possessed w^h
devils, etc. they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou
son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before our time, etc? so the
devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer us (...) go away into
the herd of swine: and he said unto them, Go, etc. The whole City came out and
besought him, that he would depart out of their coasts, Matthew. 8. 28, 29, 30,
31, 32, 33, 34. Matthew. 5. 2, 3, 4. 5, etc.

When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walks through dry places,
seeking rest and finding none: then he says, I will return to my house from
whence I came out: and when he is come, he finds it empty, swept and
garnished: then goes he and takes with him seven other spirits, more wicked
than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man
is worse, etc. Matthew. 12. 43, 44, 45.

The tares are the children of the wicked one: the Enemy who sowed them, is the
devil, Matthew. 13. 38, 39.

Jesus rebuked the devil, and he departed out of him, and the child was cured,
etc. howbeit, this kind goes not out but by prayer and fasting, Matthew. 17. 18,
21.

Lord, Even the devils are subject unto us through thy name; and he said unto
them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven, Luke 10. 17, 18.

And he was casting out a devil, etc. Some of them said, He casts out devils
by Beelzebub the chief of the devils, etc. If Satan also be divided against
himself, how shall his kingdom stand, etc? If I by Beelzebub cast out devils,
by whom do your children cast them out? Luke 11. 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20.

Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has desired you, that he may sift you as wheat:
but I have prayed for thee, that ^hy faith fail not, Luke 22. 31, 32.

Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do: he
was a Murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is
no truth in him: when he speaks of a lie, he speaks of his own: for he is a
liar, and the father of it, John 8. 44.

After Jesus had given the sop to Judas, Satan entered into him, John 13. 2, 26,
27. Luke 22. 12.

The Prince of this world comes, and has nothing in me, John 14. 30.

When the Spirit is come, etc. he will reprove (or, convince) the world of,
etc. of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged, John 16. 8, 9, 11.

I pray, etc. that thou should keep them from the evil one, John 17. 15.

Peter said, Ananias, Why has Satan filled thine heart to lie to the holy
Ghost? Acts 5. 3.

And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly, Romans 16. 20.

Confirm your love toward him, etc. lest Satan should get an advantage of us:
for we are not ignorant of his devices, 2 Cor. 2. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

If our Gospel be hid, it is hid to them who are lost: in whom the god of this
world has blinded the minds of them who believe not, lest the light of the
glorious Gospel, etc. 2 Cor. 4. 3, 4.

But I fear lest by any means, as the Serpent beguiled Eve through his
subtilty, so your mind should be corrupted, etc. No marvel, for Satan himself
is transformed into an Angel of light, 2 Cor. 11. 3, 14.

There was given me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan, to buffet me,
2 Cor. 12. 7.

Ye walked, etc. according to the Prince of the power of the air, the spirit
that now works in the children of disobedience, Ephesians. 2. 2.

Let not the sun go down upon your wrath, neither give place to the Devil,
Ephesians. 4. 26, 27.

Put on the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles
of the devil: for we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against
principalities and powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world,
against spiritual wickednesses (or, wicked spirits) in high places: wherefore
take unto you the whole armor, etc. above all things, the shield of faith,
whereby ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one,
Ephesians. 6. 10, 11, 12, 13, 16.

We would have come unto you (even I Paul) once, and again: but Satan hindered
us, 1 Thessalonians. 2. 18.

I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, 1 Thessalonians. 5. 3.

-- That wicked, etc. whose coming is after the working of Satan, with all
power, and signs, and lying wonders, 2 Thessalonians. 2. 8, 9.

In meekness instruct, etc. that they may recover themselves out of the snare
of the devil, who are taken captive (or, alive) by him at his will, 2 Timothy 2.

the devil, Heb. 2. 14.

Resist the devil, and he will flee from you, James 4. 7.

Be sober, be vigilant: because your adversary the devil, as a roaring Lion,
walks about, seeking whom he may devour: whom resist steadfast in the faith,
knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished, etc. 1 Pet. 5. 8, 9.

I write unto you young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one, 1 John 2.
13, 14. chap. 5. 18.

He who commits sin, is of the Devil: for the devil sins from the
beginning: for this purpose the Son of God was manifest, that he might destroy
the works of the devil: not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his
brother, 1 John 3. 8, 12.

The Archangel, when contending with the devil about the body of Moses, durst
not bring against him a railing accusation; but said, The Lord rebuke thee,
Jude, verse 9.

The devil shall cast some of you into prison, etc. Thou dwell where Satan's
seat is, Rev. 2. 10, 13.

-- Them of the Synagogue of Satan, etc. Rev. 3. 9.

There was war in heaven, Michael and his Angels fought against the Dragon,
etc. and the great Dragon was cast out, that old serpent called the Devil and
Satan, who deceives the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his
Angels, etc. with him, etc. The accuser of the brethren is cast down, who
accused them before our God day and night, etc. Woe unto the inhabiters of the
earth, etc. for the devil is come down unto you, having, etc. Rev. 12. 7, 8, 9,
10, 11, 12.

Satan laid hold on, bound, cast into the pit, and sealed up from deceiving,
etc. let loose again, Rev. 20.

2dly, The instruments of Satan, Seducers, Deceivers, etc. Saints Duty.
The Prophets prophecy lies in my name, I sent them not, neither have I
commanded them, neither spoke unto them: they prophecy unto you a false vision
and divination, and a thing of naught, and the deceit of their heart, Jer. 14.
14, 15.

Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheeps clothing, but inwardly
they are ravening wolves; ye shall know them by their fruits, etc. Matthew. 7.
15, 16.

Take heed that no man deceive you: for many shall come in my name, and say, I
am Christ, and shall deceive many, etc. many false prophets shall arise and
deceive many, etc. Then if any shall say unto you, Lo here is Christ, or there
is Christ, believe it not: for there shall arise false Christ's, and false
Prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders, insomuch that (if it were
possible) they shall deceive the very elect. Behold, I have told you before:
wherefore if they shall say unto you, behold, He is in the desert, etc. go not
forth, etc. for as the lightning comes out of the east, etc. so shall also the
coming of the Son of man, etc. Matthew. 24. 4, 5, 11, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27.

-- Ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will
receive, John 5. 43.

Elymas, etc. seeking to turn away the Deputy from the faith, etc. Paul, etc.
said, O full of subtilty and all mischief! thou child of the Devil, thou enemy
of all righteousness: will thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the
Lord, etc? Acts 13. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

After my departure shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the
flock: also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse' things to
draw away disciples after them; therefore watch, Acts 20. 28, 29, 30, 31.

Mark them who cause divisions, etc. contrary to the doctrine, etc. and avoid
them: for they who are such, serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own
belly: and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple,
Romans 16. 17, 18.

There must be also heresies among you, that they who are approved might be
made, etc. 1 Cor. 11. 19.

How say some among you, That there is no resurrection from the dead? 1 Cor.
15. 12.

Them who desire occasion, etc. for such are false Apostles, deceitful workers:
transforming themselves into the Apostles of Christ, etc. Satan himself is
transformed into an Angel of light: therefore it is no great thing if his
ministers be transformed into the ministers of righteousness, whose ends shall
be according to their works, etc. Ye suffer fools gladly, etc. Ye suffer if a
man bring you into bondage: if a man devour, if a man take, if a man exalt
himself, etc. smite you on the face, 2 Cor. 11. 12, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20.

There be some who trouble you, and would pervert the Gospel of Christ: though
we, or an Angel from heaven preach any other Gospel unto you, than that we have
preached unto you, let him be accursed: as we have before, so say I now again,
If any man preach any other Gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him
be accursed, Gal. 1. 7, 8, 9.

False brethren, who came in privily to spy out our liberty, etc. that they
might bring us into bondage: to whom we gave place by subjection, no not for an
hour, that the truth of the Gospel may continue with you: but of these who seem
to be, etc. Gal. 2. 3, 4, 5, 6.

They zealously affect you, but not well: yea, they would exclude you, that you
might affect them, Gal. 4. 17.

As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh, they constrain you to be
circumcised, only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ;
for neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law, but desire to
have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh, Gal. 6. 12, 13.

Be no more children tossed, etc. with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive, Ephesians. 4.
14.

This I say, lest any should beguile you with enticing words, etc. Beware, lest
any one spoil you through philosophy and vain deceits, after the traditions of
men, after the rudiments of this world, and not after Christ, etc. Let no man
judge you in meat, etc (or, for eating), etc. intruding into those things which
he has not seen, etc. and not holding the head, etc. Why are ye subject to
ordinances, etc? touch not, etc. Col. 2. 4, 8, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23.

Let no man deceive you by any means, etc. that man of sin, etc. who opposes
and exalts himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped: so
that he as God sits in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God,
etc. then shall that wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the
spirit of his mouth, and destroy with the brightness of his coming; whose
coming is after the working of Satan, with all power, and signs, and lying
wonders, and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them who perish:
because they received not the love of the truth, etc. for this cause God shall
send them strong delusions, that they should believe a lie, that they all might
be damned, etc. 2 Thessalonians. 2. 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

Charge some, that they teach no other doctrine, neither give heed to Jewish
fables, etc. some have swerved, having turned aside to vain janglings, desiring
to be teachers of the law, understanding neither what they say, nor whereof
they affirm, 1 Timothy 1. 3, 4, 6, 7, 8.

Now the Spirit speaks expressly, that in the latter days some shall depart
from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils:
speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their consciences feared with a hot iron:
forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, etc. 1 Timothy 4. 1, 2,
3.

If any man teach otherwise, etc. he is proud, knowing nothing: but doting (or,
sick) about questions and strifes of words, whereof comes envy, etc. perverse
disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth: supposing that
gain is godliness: from such withdraw thy self: Some, etc. have erred, 1 Timothy
6. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 20, 21.

Strive not about words to no profit, to the subverting of the hearers, etc.
shun profane and vain babbling, for they will increase to more ungodliness, and
their word will eat as does a canker (or, gangrene): of whom is Hymeneus, etc.
who concerning the truth have erred, saying, That the resurrection is past
already, and overthrow the faith of some: nevertheless, the foundation of God
stands sure, etc. 2 Timothy 2. 14, 16, 17, 18, 19.

Perilous times shall come: for men shall be lovers of their own selves:
covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful,
unholy, without natural affection, truce breakers, false accusers, incontinent,
fierce, despisers of those who are good: traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers
of pleasures more than lovers of God: having a form of godliness, but denying
the power thereof: from such turn away: for of this sort are they who creep
into houses, and lead captive silly women, laden with sins, led away with
diverse lusts, ever learning, and never come to the knowledge of the truth. Now
as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men
of corrupt minds, reprobate (or, of no judgment) concerning the faith, etc. but
evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived:
but continue thou in the things, etc. 2 Timothy 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 13, 14.

The time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but after their
own lusts shall they heap up to themselves teachers, having itching ears: and
they shall turn away their ears from truth, and shall be turned unto fables:
but watch thou, etc. 2 Timothy 4. 3, 4, 5.

A Bishop must be blameless, etc. holding fast the faithful word as he has
been taught (or, in teaching) that he may be able by sound doctrine, both to
exhort and convince the gainsayers: for there are many unruly and vain talkers
and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision: whose mouths must be
stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for
filthy lucres sake, etc. Rebuke them sharply, etc. not giving heed to Jewish
fables and commandments of men, who turn from the truth, etc. They profess that
they know God, but in works they deny him, being, etc. Titus 1. 7, 9, 10, 11,
13, 14, 16.

Be not carried about with diverse and strange doctrines: for it is a good thing
that the heart, etc. Heb. 13. 9.

But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be
false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even
denying the Lord who bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction:
and many shall follow their pernicious ways, by reason of whom the way of truth
shall be evil spoken of: and through covetousness shall they with feigned words
make merchandise of you, whose judgment now of a long time lingreth not, etc.
chiefly them who walk after the flesh, etc. and despise government (or,
dominions), presumptuous, self-willed: they are not afraid to speak evil of
dignities, etc. these as natural bruit beasts, etc. speak evil of the things
they understand not, etc. sporting themselves with their own deceivings, while
they feast with you; having eyes full of adultery, who cannot cease from sin:
beguiling unstable souls: an heart which is exercised with covetous practices,
etc. who have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, etc. These are wells
without water, clouds which are carried with a tempest, to whom the midst of
darkness is reserved for ever: for when they speak great swelling words of
vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, etc. those who were clean
escaped from them, who live in error, while they promise them, etc. 2 Pet. 2.
1, 2, 3, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19.

There shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts, and
saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep,
all things continue as they were from the beginning, etc. Some things are hard
to be understood, which they who are unlearned and unstable, wrest, as they do
also the other Scriptures, unto their own destruction: ye therefore, beloved,
seeing ye know before, beware, lest ye also being led away with the error of
the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness, 2 Pet. 3. 3, 4, 15, 16, 17.

Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard Antichrist shall
come, even now are there many Antichrists, whereby we know that it is the last
time: they went out from us, but they were not of us, etc. Who is a liar, but
he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? he is Antichrist who denies the
father and the Son, etc. These things have I written unto you concerning them
who deceive you, 1 John 2. 18, 19, 22, 26.

Believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God, because
many false prophets are gone out into the world: hereby know ye the spirit of
God; every spirit who confesses Jesus Christ to have been come in the flesh,
is of God; and every spirit who confesses not that Jesus Christ is come in the
flesh, is not of God: and this is that spirit of Antichrist, whereof you have
heard that it should come, and even now already it is in the world, etc. they
are of the world, therefore speak they of the world, and the world hears
them, etc. He who is of God hears us: he who is not of God hears not us:
hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error, etc. 1 John 4. 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

Many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is
come in the flesh: this is a deceiver and an Antichrist: look to your selves
that we lose not those things which we have wrought, etc. Whosoever
transgresses and abides not in the doctrine of Christ, has not God, etc. If
there come any to you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your
house, neither bid him God-speed: for he who bids him God-speed, is partaker of
his evil deeds, 2 John, verse 7. 8, 9, 10, 11.

Earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints: for
there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to
this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of God into lasciviousness,
and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ, etc. These filthy
dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominions, and speak evil of dignities: yet
Michael, etc. contending with the devil, etc. durst not bring against him a
railing accusation, etc. These speak evil of those things which they know not,
etc. Clouds they are without water, etc. These are murmurers, complainers,
walking after their own lusts, and their mouth speaks great swelling-words,
having men's persons in admiration because of advantage, etc. These be they who
separate themselves, sensual, having not the spirit, Jude, ver. 3. 4, 8, 9, 10,
12, 13, 16, 18, 19.

heart, Psalm. 44. 20, 21.

Confounded be all they who serve graven-images, who boast themselves of Idols:
worship him all ye gods, Psalm. 97. 7.

Our God is in the heavens, he has done whatsoever he pleased: their Idols are
silver and gold, the works of men's hands: they have mouths, but they speak not:

every one who trusts in them, Psalm. 115. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Psalm. 135. 15, 16,
etc.

Their land also is full of Idols: they worship the work of their own hands,
that which their own fingers have made: and the mean man boweth down, and the
great man humbles himself, etc. The Idols shall utterly pass away, and they

day, a man shall cast his Idols of silver, and his Idols of gold which they
made each one for himself to worship, to the moles and to the bats, etc. Isa.

my praise to graven-images, etc. they shall be turned back: they shall be
greatly ashamed who trust in graven-images: who say to the molten-images, Ye
are our gods, Isa. 42. 8, 17.

They who make graven-images, are all of them vanity, etc. they see not, nor
know, that they may be ashamed: Who has formed a god, or molten a
graven-image, which is profitable for nothing? behold, all his fellows shall be
ashamed, and the workmen, etc. they shall be ashamed together, etc. The
Carpenter, etc. heweth down Cedars, etc. he will take thereof and warm himself:
yea, he kindles it, and baketh bread: yea, he makes a god and worshippeth it:
he makes it a graven-image, and falls down thereto: he burns part thereof
in fire, etc. and the residue thereof he makes a god; his graven-image, he
falls down and worshippeth it, and prays unto it, and says, Deliver me,
for thou art my God, etc. None considers in his heart, neither is there
knowledge or understanding to say, I have burnt part of it in the fire, etc. and
shall I make the residue thereof an abomination? shall I fall down to the stock
of (or, that which comes from) a tree? Isa. 44. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,
17, 18, 19.

They shall be ashamed, and also confounded all of them: they shall go to
confusions together, who are makers of Idols, etc. they have no knowledge who
set up the wood of their graven-image, and pray unto a god who cannot save,
Isa. 45. 16, 20.

To whom will ye liken me, etc? they lavish gold out of the bag, etc. hire a
Goldsmith, and he makes it a god: and they fall down, yea, they worship: they
bear him upon the shoulder, they carry him and set him in his place: and he
stands, etc. yea, one shall cry to him, yet can he not answer, nor save him
out of his trouble, Isa. 46. 5, 6, 7.

gardens, and burns incense upon altars of brick, etc. Isa. 65. 3, 4. Jer. 1.
16.

Has a nation changed their gods, which are yet no gods? but my people have
changed their glory for that which does not profit, etc. The house of Israel
ashamed, etc. saying to a stock, Thou art my father; and to a stone, thou have

the number of thy Cities, are thy gods, O Judah, Jer. 2. 10, 11, 26, 27, 28.
chap. 11. 12, 13.

Israel is gone up upon every high mountain, and under every green tree: and
there plays the harlot, etc. her treacherous sister Judah feared not, but
went and played the harlot also, etc. committed adultery with stones and with
stocks, Jer. 3. 6, 8, 9.

See thou what they do in the Cities of Judah, and in the streets of
Jerusalem? the children gather wood, and the fathers kindle a fire: and the
women knead their dough to make cakes to the Queen of heaven, and to pour out
drink offerings unto other gods, that they may provoke me to anger, Jer. 7. 17,
18.

They are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock is a doctrine of vanities:
silver spread into plate, etc. but the Lord is the true God, etc. The gods who
have not made the heavens and the earth, they shall perish from the earth, and
from under these heavens, etc. every founder is confounded by the graven-image:
for his molten-image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them: they are
vanity, and the work of errors, Jer. 10. 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15.

Are there any among the vanities of the Gentiles that can cause rain? Jer. 14.
22.

vanity, and things wherein is no profit: shall a man make gods unto himself,

Then all the men who knew that their wives had burnt incense unto other gods:
and all the women who stood by, etc. answered Jeremy, saying, etc. We will

unto the Queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, as we have
done, we and our fathers, our kings and our princes, in the Cities of Judah,
and in the streets of Jerusalem: for then had we plenty, etc. so the Lord could
no longer bear, etc. Jer. 44. 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21.

I am broken with their whorish heart which have departed from me, and with
their eyes which go a whoring after their Idols, etc. Ezekiel. 6. 9.

These men have set up their Idols in their hearts, and put the stumbling block
of their iniquity before their face: should I be enquired of at all by them,
etc? I the Lord will answer him according to the multitude of his Idols, etc. I
the Lord will answer him by my self, Ezekiel. 14. 1, 4, 5, 6, 7. Hosea 2. 2, 3, 4.

The unsatiable idolatry of Jerusalem, with all nations, Ezekiel. 16. 15, 16, etc.

they should offer any more unto him, Ezekiel. 44. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

The Image of Nebuchadnezzar set up, Dan. 3.

My people ask counsel at their stock, and their staff declares unto them: for
the spirit of whoredoms have caused them to err, and they have gone a whoring
from under their God; they sacrifice upon the top of mountains, and burn
incense upon the hills, under Oaks, etc. Ephraim is joined to Idols, let him
alone, Hosea 4. 12, 13, 17.

Of their silver and their gold have they made them Idols, that they may be cut
off: thy calf, O Samaria, has cast thee off: mine anger is kindled, etc. The
workman made it, therefore it is not God: but the calf of Samaria shall be
broken in pieces, for they have sown the wind, Hosea 8. 4, 5, 6, 7.

According to the multitude of his fruit, he has increased the altars:
according unto the goodness of his land, they have made goodly Images: their
heart is divided: now they shall be found faulty; he shall break down their
altars: he shall spoil their Images, Hosea 10. 1, 2.

And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten-images of their
silver, and Idols according to their own understanding; all of it the work of
the crafts-men: they say of them, Let the men who sacrifice, kiss the calves:
therefore they shall be as the morning-cloud, etc. Hosea 13. 2, 3.

For their Idols have spoken vanity, and the Diviners have seen a lie, and have
told false dreams, etc. Zechar. 10. 2.

and they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius; because he was the
chief speaker: Then the priest of Jupiter, etc. brought oxen and garlands unto
the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the people: which when the
Apostles, Barnabas and Paul heard of, they rent their clothes, and ran in among
the people, crying out, and saying, Sirs, What do ye in these things? We are
also men of like passions with you, and preach unto you, that ye should turn
from these vanities unto the living God who made heaven and earth, etc. Acts
14. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18.

29

Paul, etc. at Athens, his spirit was stirred within him, when he saw the City
wholly given to Idolatry (or, full of Idols): therefore disputed he in the
Synagogue, etc. Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too
superstitious: for, as I past by and beheld your devotions (or, gods whom ye
worship), I found an altar with this inscription, To the unknown God: Whom
therefore ye ignorantly worship, etc. Forasmuch then as we are the offspring
of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or
stone, graven by art, or man's device, Acts 17. 16, 17, 22, 23, 29.

Demetrius said, This Paul has persuaded and turned away much people, saying,
That they be no gods which are made with hands: so that not only this our craft
is in danger, etc. but also, that the temple of the great goddess Diana should
be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the
world worshippeth, etc. Great is Diana of the Ephesians, etc. the Image which
fell down from Jupiter, Acts 19. 26, 27, 28, 34, 35.

their imaginations, etc. and changed the glory of the invisible God, into an
image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, etc. who changed the truth of
God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator,
Romans 1. 21, 23, 25. chap. 2. 22.

Thou who abhorrest Idols, do thou commit sacriledg? Romans 2. 22.

We know that an Idol is nothing in the World, and that there is none other God
but one: for though there be that are called gods (whether in heaven or earth),
as there be gods many, and lords many: but to us there is but one God, etc. 1
Cor. 8. 4, 5, 6.

Neither be ye Idolaters, as were some of them: as it is written, The people
sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play, etc. My dearly beloved, flee
from Idolatry, etc. What say I then, that the Idol is any thing? or that which
is offered in sacrifice, is any thing? but I say, That the things which the
Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not
that ye should have fellowship with devils, 1 Cor. 10. 7, 14, 19, 20.

Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb Idols, 1 Cor. 12.

CHAP. XLIV. Of the Kings of Israel and Judah: How they came to their Power and
Office.
GIdeon had judged Israel: he had seventy sons. Abimelech one of the sons of
Gideon by his servant (by subtilty with the men of Shechem, that it was better
one should reign than all the seventy sons), procures money, hires vain and
light persons, and kills all his brethren (except Jotham the youngest, who hid
himself). Abimelech by the men of Shechem and the house of Millo, made King.
After a few years he was slain by a piece of millstone a woman threw down on
him: after whom Judges governed a long time, till Samuel, Judges 9.

Israel by the Elders came to Samuel, and said, Make us a King to judge us, like
all the nations: and though God was displeased at it, and said, They had
rejected not Samuel, but God himself, that he should not reign over them: yet
he bids Samuel hearken unto them, and make them a King, 1 Samuel 8.

Samuel, before Saul came, was told of God of his coming: and that he should be
the man whom he should ano^nt king. Samuel anoints him king accordingly, 1 Samuel
9. chap. 10.

According to this afterward, all the people went to Gilgal: and there they
made Saul king before the Lord, 1 Samuel 11. 14, 15.

Samuel said to Saul, When thou wast little in thine own sight, wast thou not
made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the Lord anointed thee king over
Israel, etc? Because thou have rejected the word of the Lord, he has rejected
thee from being king, 1 Samuel 15. 17, 23.

Samuel, by Gods special direction, anointed David the son of Jesse to be king
(although Saul was yet living): and the spirit left Saul, and came upon David,
1 Samuel 16. 1, 12, 13, 14.

And after Saul's death, the men of Judah came to Hebron, and there they
anointed David king over Judah: but Abner made Ishbosheth the son of Saul king
over all Israel, 2 Samuel 2. 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9.

After the death of Ishbosheth (being slain), came all the tribes of Israel to
David unto Hebron, etc. And all the Elders of Israel came, etc. and king David
made a league with them: and they anointed David king over Israel, 2 Samuel 5. 1,
2, 3.

out of the hands of Solomon's son, and give ten tribes unto him: Solomon died,

All Israel came to Shechem to make Rehoboam king; the people proposing ease,
and Rehoboam refusing to grant it, (the cause was from the Lord, that he might
perform what he had said), ten tribes fell off from him. And when all Israel
had heard that Jeroboam was come again, they sent and called him to the
congregation, and made him king over all Israel. When Rehoboam intended by
sorce to reduce them, God forbid it, and said, This thing is from me: only
Judah subjected to Rehoboam, 1 Kings 12. 1, 2, 3, 4, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20,
21, 22, 23, 24.

Go tell Jeroboam, thus says the Lord God of Israel, Forasmuch as I exalted
thee from among the people, and made thee Prince over my people Israel, and

Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust, and made thee Prince over my
people Israel, and thou have walked in the way of Jeroboam: Behold, I will take
away the posterity of Baasha, etc. Baasha died, Elah his son reigned in his
stead. Zimri, one of Elah his servants, conspired against him, and smote him,
and killed him, and reigned in his stead over Israel. But when Israel being in
the Camp, heard of it, they made Omri the Captain of the Host, king that day in

living in Jezreel, and wounded): when the young man anointed him, he said, Thus
says the Lord God of Israel, I have anointed thee king over the people of the
Lord, even over Israel: and thou shall smite the house of Ahab thy master, that
I may avenge, etc. Then the army proclaimed him king: then Jehu killed Jehoram
king of Israel, etc. and also Ahaziah the king of Judah was slain by Jehu, 2
Kings 9. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 13, 14, 24, 27.

And the Lord said unto Jehu, Because thou have done well in executing that
which was right in mine eyes: and have done unto the house of Ahab according
unto all which was in my heart, thy children of the fourth generaration shall
sit on the throne of Israel. Jehu died, and Jehoahaz his son reigned in his
stead, over Israel, 2 Kings 10. 30, 35.
