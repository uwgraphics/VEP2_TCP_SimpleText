THE CHARACTER Of an old ENGLISH PVRITAN, OR, NONCONFORMIST,
THE Old English Puritan was such an one, that honored God Mat. ^2.37, 38,
39. 1 Pet. 2.17
above all, and under God gave Romans 13.7.
every one his due. His Mat. 6.33.
first care was to serve God, and therein he did not what was good in his Deuteronomy.
12.8.32
own, but in Gods sight, making the word of God the rule of his worship. He
highly esteemed Col. 2.5.
order in the House of God; but would not under color of that, submit to
superstitious rites, which are superfluous, and Ver. 21, 22
perish in their use. He reverenced Romans 13.1.
Authority, keeping within its sphere; but durst not under pretense of
subjection to the higher powers Mat. 15.9 Col. 2 8.
, worship God after the traditions of men. He made conscience of Acts. 2.42.
all Gods Ordinances, though 1 Cor. 1.17
some he esteemed of more consequence. He was much in Col. 4 2.
prayer; with it he Psalm. 92.2.
began, and closed the day. In it he was exercised in his Psalm. 55.17 Mat. 6.6
closet, 2 Samuel 6.20
family, 1 Timothy 2.1, 2
and public assembly. He esteemed that manner of prayer best, where by the 1 Samuel 1.15 Romans 8 26
gift of God, expressions were varied according to present wants and occasions;
yet did he not account Numb. 10.35, 36
set-forms unlawful. Therefore in that circumstance of the Church he did not
wholly 1 Co. 9.20, 21.22, 23.
reject the Liturgy, but the corruption of it. He esteemed Acts 13.15 Psalm. 1.2
reading of the word an ordinance of God both in private and public; but did
not account reading to be preaching. The Word 2 Timothy 3.13, 1^
read the esteemed of more authority, but the 1 Cor. 1.2^. Romans 1 16
word preached of more efficacy. Mat 28 20
He accounted preaching as necessary now as in the Primitive Church: Gods 1
Cor. 1 21
pleasure being still by the foolishness of preaching to save those that
believe. He esteemed that preaching best 1 Cor 14 24, 25. 1 Cor. 2 1, 3, 4, 5 2
Cor 4 5.
wherein was most of God, least of man, when vain flourishes of wit and words
were declined, and the demonstration of Gods Spirit and Power studied: yet
could he distinguish between 2. Cor. 2.17 1 Timothy 4 13 2 Timothy 2 15 Eccl. 12.9, 10
studied plainness, and negligent rudeness. He accounted 1 Cor 14.1, 2, 3, 4 5
6, 9
perspicuity the best grace of a Preacher; And that 1 Cor 14.25
method best which was most helpful to understanding, affection, and memory. To
which ordinarily he esteemed none so conducible as that by Doctrine, Reason and
Use. He esteemed those 1 Timothy 5.1
Sermons best that came closest to the conscience; yet would he have men's
consciences awakened, not their persons disgraced. He was a man of good
spiritual 1 Pet. 2 2.
appetite, and could not be contented with Iam. 1.19 2 Timothy 4 1 2
one meal a day. An Afternoon-Sermon did relish as well to him as one in the
morning. He was not satisfied with Prove 28.9
prayers without preaching: which if it were wanting at Amos 8 ^1.12 Mat 3.5.
home, he would seek abroad; yet would he not by 1 Cor. 3.21, 22. 1 Cor. 4.6
absence discourage his Minister, if faithful, though another might have
quicker gifts. A 2 Timothy 4.1, 2
Lecture he esteemed, though not necessary, yet a blessing, and would redeem
Ephesians. 5.16
such an opportunity with some pains and loss. The 1 Cor. 16.2 Acts 20 7.
Revel. 1.10.
Lords day he esteemed a divine ordinance, and Exodus: ^^
rest on it necessary, so far as it conduced to holiness He was Exodus 20.8.
very conscientious in observance of that day as the Mart day of the Soul He
was very careful to 2 Chronicles. 2 2 2^. Psalm 91.
remember it, to get house and heart in order for it: and when it came, he was
studious to improve it. He Isa 58 13, 14
redeemed the morning from superfluous sleep, Exodus 20 8 Acts 20.7
and watched the whole day over his thoughts and words not only to restrain
them from wickedness, but worldlynesse. Deuteronomy. 6, 7
All parts of the day were alike holy to him, and his care was continued in it
in variety of holy duties: what he heard in public, he repeated in private, to
Isa: 58.13, 14
whet it upon himself and family. Lawful Exodus: 3 2 6
recreations he thought this day unseasonable, and M^^ 12.1^7
unlawful ones much more abominable: yet he knew 8 (...) ^.12, 13 1 C^r 7.14.
(...) 16.15
the liberty God gave him for needful refreshing, which he did neither refuse
nor abuse. The Sacrament of 1 Cor* 10: 6
Baptism he received in Infancy, which he looked back to in age to answer his
engagements, and claim his privileges; b The Lords Supper he accounted part of
his souls food: 5 John 7.37. John 6 48
to which he labored to keep an appetite. 1 Cor: 10, 16
He esteemed it an ordinance of nearest communion with Christ, and so requiring
most 1 Cor. 11: 28
exact preparation. His first care was in the 1 Cor. 5: 2.13
examination of himself: yet as an act of Revel. 2, 2
office or charity, he had an eye on others.

He endeavored to have the scandalous Revel. 2 25.
cast out of Communion: but he Mat. 16.6
cast not out himself, because the scandalous were suffered by the negligence
of others He condemned that Acts 13.12 1 Cor. 7 5
superstition and vanity of Popish mock-fasts: yet neglected not one occasion
to humble his soul by right fasting: Mat. 15 8
He abhorred the Popish doctrine of opus operatum in the notion. And in
practice rested in Ioh. 4.23, 24
no performance, but what was done in spirit and truth. He thought God had left
a rule in his word for Heb. 3.2.5, 6.
discipline, and that 1 Timothy 5.17. 1 Timothy 4: 14 Act. 20.17.28. Act. 21.18.
Aristocratical by Elders, not Monarchichal by Bishops, nor Democraticall by
the people. Right Ioh. 11.51
Discpline he judged pertaining not to the being, but well-being of a Church.
Therefore he esteemed those Churches most pure where the Government is by
Elders, yet unchurched not those where it was otherwise. Perfection 1 Cor.
11.17, 18, 19. Rev. 2.14.20.
in Churches he thought a thing rather to be desired then hoped for. And so he
expected not a Church state without all defects. The 1 Cor. 5.2. Rev 2.5. Ezekiel.
^ 4.
corruptions that were in Churches he thought his duty to bewail, with
endeavors of amendment: yet would he not Heb. 10.25 John 4.11.
separate, where he might partake in the worship, and not in the coruption. He
put not 1 Timothy 2.8
holiness in Churches, as in the Temple of the Jews; but only counted them
convenient like their Synagogues. He would have them kept 1 Cor. 14.40
decent, not magnificent, knowing that the Gospel requires not outward pomp.
His chiefest music was Iam. 5.^3.
singing of Psalm^: wherein though he neglected not the melody of the voice,
yet he chiefly looked after that of the Col. 3.16.
heart. He disliked such 1 Cor. 14.26.
Church music as moved sensual delight, and was an hindrance to spiritual
inlargements. He accounted Romans 13 1. Iam. 1.27.
subjection to the Higher Powers to be part of pure religion, as well as to
visit the fatherless and widows: yet did he distinguish between authority and
lusts of Magistrates, to that he submitted, 1 Cor. 7.23
but in these he durst not be a servant of men, being bought with a price. Romans
13.5
Just Laws and commands he willingly obeyed not only for fear but for
conscience also; but such as were unjust he refused to observe, choosing Acts 4
19
rather to obey God then man: yet his refusal was Ier. 26.14 15.
modest and with submission to penalties, unless he could procure indulgence
from Authority. He was careful in all relations to know and do duty, and that
with Ephesians 5.21.22, etc.
singleness of heart as unto Christ. He accounted Col. 3.22
religion an engagement to duty, that the best Christians should be best
husbands, best wives, best parents, best children, best masters, best servants,
best magistrates, best subjects, that the 1 Timothy 6.1 Titus 2 9, 10
doctrine of God might be adorned Colos. 4 15
not blasphemed. His family he endeavored to make a Church, both in regard of
Ps. 1.1 2, 6 7
persons and exercises, admitting none into it but such as feared God, and
laboring that those that were born in it, might be born again to God. He 1
Chr. 16.43.
blessed his family morning and evening by the Word and Prayer, and took care
to perform those Ordinances in the best season. He Ephesians. 6 4
brought up his children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, and
commanded his Genesis 18 19
servants to keep the way of the Lord. He set up Psalm. 101
discipline in his Family, as he desired it in the Church, not only reproving,
1 Samuel 3.13
but restraining vileness in his. Tit 2.21, 12
He was conscientious Prove. 11.1
of equity as well as piety: Ezekiel. 36 26
knowing that 2 Cor. 1.17.
unrighteousness is abomination as well as ungodliness. He was cautelous in
promising, Psalm. 15.4
but careful in performing, counting his word no less engagement then his bond.
He was a man of a tender heart, not only in regard of his own sin, but others

misery not counting mercy Mat. 25.34, 35
arbitrary, but a necessary duty, wherein as he prayed for Psalm 112.5
Wisdom to direct him, so he studied for Romans 12.8
cheerfulness and 2 Cor. 9.5, 6 7
bounty to act. He was sober in the use of the things of this life, rather 1
Pet. 5.8
beating down the body, then pampering it; yet Eccles. 2.14
he denied, not himself the use of Gods blessing, lest he should be Deuteronomy. 8 10
11
unthankful; but avoided excess lest he should be forgetful of the Doner In his
habit he avoided 1 Timothy 2: ^ 1 Pet. 3.3, 4
costliness and vanity, neither exceeding his degree in civility, nor declining
what suited with Christianity, desiring in all things to express Phil 4 8
gravity. His whole life he accounted Ephesians. 6.10, 11 12
a warfare, wherein Christ was his Captain, his arms, Ephesians. 6.18 Hosea 12.4
prayers and tears. The Heb 2.9, 10
Cross his Banner, and his Luke 8 15
word Vincit qui patitur.

He was (...) immovable in all times, so that they who in the midst of many
opinions have lost the view of true Religion, may return to him and there find
it. Mat. 16 24


REader, Seeing a passage in Mr. Tombs his Book against Paedobaptism; wherein
he compares the Non conformists in England, to the Anabaptists in Germany, in
regard of their miscarriages and ill success in their endeavors, till of late
years, I was moved for the vindication of those Faithful and Reverend Witnesses
of Christ, to publish this Character; whereof if any shall desire proof in
matter of fact, as in matter of right the Margent contains evidence, let him
either consult their Writings, or those who are fit Witnesses by reason of age,
fidelity and acquaintance, having fully known their Doctrine, manner of li^e,
purpose, faith, long-suffering, love, patience, persecution and affliction,
etc. 2 Timothy 3.10, 11. And I doubt not but full testimony will be given that
their aim and general course was according to the Rule: Some extravagants there
be in all professions, but we are to judge of a profession by the rule they
hold forth, and that carriage of the professors which is general and ordinary.

FINIS.
