Angliae, etc. decimo nono.
IT is thought fit and ordered by this Court, That in the Appointment of
Appraisers, regard be had to the Honesty and Integrity of the Persons, and
their Judgment, Skill, and Experience in the Goods to be Appraised; and that no
Appraisement shall be made, nor accepted, of the Goods of any Freeman of this
City, deceasing and leaving Orphans, unless Mr. Common-Cryer or his Deputy be
present at the same Appraisement, according to ancient Usage, and sundry Acts
of Common Council, and Orders of this Court, from Time to Time made in this
Behalf. And that Mr. Common-Cryer may the better and more certainly attend this
Affair, he is to receive from the Executors therein concerned, a Day's Notice
at least beforehand, of the Time and Place when and where such Appraisement
shall be made.

STRACEY.
Mr. Elderton, the Common-Cryer, dwells in Aldersgate-House, or in Little
Tower-street.

You are to have Four Freemen to be Appraisers, who are first to be Sworn
before the Lord Mayor, or some Alderman, of which you may choose Two Your Self.
