A Letter from Feversham, Giving a True ACCOUNT Of several Persons who were
Taken, being Embarked with His MAJESTY In a Vessel which lay in a Creek near
Feversham in Kent.
Dated the 12 th. of December, 1688.
HIS Majesty having of late (to the great dissatisfaction of the whole Kingdom)
thought it convenient, at this juncture, to withdraw Himself from White Hall,
in order, (as is supposed) to Transport Himself for some time beyond Sea, being
Attended with several Gentlemen, of whom we shall proceed to give you an exact
Account.

His MAJESTY, in order to Prosecute His Intention, on the Eleventh of December
Embarked Himself in a small Vessel, which lay in a Creek near Feversham, with
these following Persons to Attend Him: Sir Edward Hales, Mr. Shelton, and some
other Gentlemen, whose Names, as yet, we have no certain information off: But
being on Board, lying for a fair Wind, to Convey them to the Place intended,
were discovered, and the above Named Gentlemen, who waited on His MAJESTY, were
Seized by a Party in behalf of the Prince of Orange; upon which His MAJESTY
thought it Convenient to omit his Passage, and countermand His Resolution to
return to Town.

We have likewise an Account that Baron Jenner, Graham, and others were
likewise taken at Feversham.

The Earl of Salisbury, and Mr. Hales, at Ashford.

And also, old Obediah Walker, and other Jesuits at Sittingborn; who are now
under the County Guards, in Order to the bringing of them with all convenient
Speed to London.

Printed for I. H. 1688.
