Comitatu Essexiae.
UT Causae quare Protestants hi non possent in publicis conventionibus
Ecclesiae Anglicanae audire, and sic cum eodem Ministerio adorare.

CVm in secundo Articulo solennis Confaederationis et Compacti per nos accepti
ad Gloriam DEI et exaltationem regni Domini nostri et salvatoris Jesu Christi,
et alias intentiones pias in eo expressas; Invenimus Nos jurare Quod absque
respectu Personarum, tentabimus extirpationem Papatiae, Praelatiae, id est,
Ecclesiasticanae gubernationis per Archi-Epis-chopos, Cancellarios suos,
Commissarios, Decanos, Decanos-et-Capitulos, Archi-Decanos, et omnes alios
Ecclesiasticos Ministros sub eandem Hierarchiam dependentes;

Nos metipsos tenemus obligatos mundo universo declarare, Protestationemque
facere, Quod non audemus ultra communicare cum, aut saltem appropinquare (sed
renunciamus et abhorremus) Ministerium Ecclesiae Anglicanae ut adhuc manet
stabilitum, and nominatum Parsonae, Vicarii et Curati; vt qui sunt
Anti-christiani, et in ordinatione eorum dependent super Hierarchiam,
sacerdotium accepti, unum ejusdem Hierarchiae ordinem: Et ordinati per
Pontifices, vt Pontifices, vt simiae deridentes Christum, imitatione vana
simulantes dare iis Spiritum Sanctum: Et per juramentum Canonicae obedientiae
exaltantes Pontifices super Christum, qui declaravit Canones Ecclesiae suae
immutabiliter in verbo ipsius. Isto tamen juramento stant obligati obedire
Canonibus nunc factis vel postea facturis.

Ut patrocinantes in praxi praeterita Cultum Idolatricum ac voluntarium,
Leiturgiae et Ceremoniarum ex diametro contrarium Libertati sanguine Christi
acquisitae, et Plurimi adversus cognitionem Conscientiamque

Vt magni profanatores Sacro Sancta Dei, non distinguentes inter pretiosos et
viles.

Vt rei sanguinum multorum, magnam concelantes partem conciliorum Dei.

Vt viventes judaico, papistico, et extortionali stipendio Decimarum,
Oblationumque

Vt ij qui si non primam institutionem suam renunciant, grandes divisores inter
nos et Scotiam, sunt: Vt qui sunt tam Anti-presbyteriales quam Anti-Christiani.

Vt ij qui secundum primitiva et Apostolica exemplaria, suffragiis Ecclesiarum,
nunquam vocabantur.

In visceribus Domini nostri Jesus itaque rogamus and quaesumus omnes illos
Ministros Ecclesiae Anglicanae, qui spiritum Christi habent, ut primam
vocationem vitamque eorum renunciantes; a Deo expectarent vocationem rectam a
se et populo ipsius secundum Christi Testamentum: vt sic iis communicemus in
societate Christiana.

Dominusque ita benedicat et Ministrum, Populumque. Subscripta eodem die, per
Robertum Fagium juniorem, et Thomam Reignoldum, in presentia Anthonii Luther
Armigeri.
Idem etiam Protestants tunc appellationem faciebant Domo Honorabilissimo
Communium Curiae Altissimi Parlementi; An compelli debent ad Conventiones
Ecclesiae Anglicanae contra Conscientiam ire.

Super quo, Iusticiarius dedit eis libertatem frui conscientiis, et
Appellationem prosequi.



A PROTESTATION
ATTESTED Before Anthony Luther Esquire, one of the Justices of the Peace, for
the County of Essex, upon June 10. 1644.
As the causes why the Protesters could not hear in the public Assemblies of
the Church of England, and so join in worship with that Ministry.

Whereas in the second Article of the Solemn League and Covenant, taken by us
for the glory of GOD, and the advancement of the Kingdom of our LORD and
SAVIOVR JESUS CHRIST, and other the godly Ends therein expressed; We find that
we swear, That we shall without respect of persons, endeavor the extirpation
of Popery, Prelacy; that is, Church Government by Archbishops, Bishops, their
Chancellours, Commissaries, Deans, Deans and Chapters, Archdeacons, and all
other Ecclesiastical Officers depending on that Hierarchy;

We hold our selves bound to declare, and protest, unto the whole World, That
we dare noe longer join unto, and communicate with, (but do renounce and
abhor) the Ministry of the Church of England, as it remains yet established,
and named Parsons, Vicars, and Curates.

As being Antichristian, and in their Ordination depending upon the Hierarchy,
having taken priesthood one of the Orders thereof, and having been ordained by
Bishops, as they were Bishops, by their apish mockery of Christ, as it were
giving unto them the Holy Ghost. And by their Oath of Canonical obedience;
setting up Bishops above CHRIST, who has declared the Canons of his Church,
unalterably in his Word: Yet by that Oath they stand bound to obey all Canons
now made, or hereafter to be made.

As maintaining in their former practice, an Idolatrous will worship of the
Service and Ceremonies, directly contrary to the liberty purchased by the blood
of Christ, and many fem against knowledge and conscience.

As great Profaners of the holy things of God, putting no difference between
the precious and the vile.

As guilty of the blood of many, concealing a great part of the council of God.

As living by a Jewish, Popish, and extortionous maintenance of tithes and
offerings.

As they, who if they renounce not their former Call, are great dividers
between us and Scotland, being Anti-Presbyteriall, as well as Antichristian.

As they, who were never called, according to the Primitive and Apostolic
examples, by the Churches election.

We do therefore in the Bowels of the Lord Jesus, earnestly entreat, and
beseech all those Ministers of the Church of England, that have the Spirit of
Christ, that, renouncing their former calling and life, they would wait upon
GOD, for a right call from him, and his people, according to Christ's Testament;
that so we may communicate with them in Christian Society.

And the LORD so bless both Minister and people. Subscribed the same day by
ROBERT FAGE, junior, and THOMAS REIGNOLDS: In the presence of ANTHONY LVTHER,
Esquire.
And the same PROTESTERS did likewise then appeal to the Honorable House of
COMMONS, the High Court of Parliament; whether they ought to be compelled to
go to the Assemblies of England against their Consciences.

Whereupon the Justice gave them liberty to enjoy their Consciences, and to
prosecute their Appeal.
