For I have five brethren, that he may testify unto ^^em, lest they also come

And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one ^ent unto them from the dead,

OR, FAIR WARNINGS TO A Careless World.
Showing,
THat all sorts of men that have gone before us, into an eternal state, of all
conditions, as Emperors, Kings, Philosophers, Statesmen, etc. of all
Religions, as Heathens, Jews, Mahometans, Christians; of all Opinions among
Christians, and of all Tempers under those Opinions, whether strict and
serious, or loose and debauched, in all ages of the world from the Creation,
have left this great observation behind them, that upon experience they have
found^ that what vain thoughts soever men may in the heat of their youth and
lust, entertain of Religion, they will sooner or later feel a testimony God
has given it in every man's breast, which will one day make them serious,
either by the inexpressible fears, terrors and Agonies of a troubled mind, or
the unconceivable peace, comfort and joy of a good Conscience. A small part
whereof was Printed 1665. both at London and at York, ad obturandum os
Atheorum, (to use the words of the Reverend Doctor Digle, Chaplain to the Lord
Archbishop of York, in his earnest and particular Recommendation of it to the
Press there) to awaken us out of our Prodigious Atheism and Infidelity, a
little before the late Dreadful judgments, that made us feel the power of that
God whom we wouldnot believe; and the whole is now published upon a pious
Persons importunate request, Dr. T. Th.
that we may take example by others, to be serious in the matter of our eternal
concernments, before we be made examples our selves.

A CARELESS WORLD.
Letter from the Right Hon James Earl of Marleburgh, a little before his death
in the Battle at Sea, on the Coast of Holland, 1665.
the Right Honorable Sir Hugh Pollard, Comptroler of his Majesty's Household.
Sir,
I Believe the goodness of your nature, and the freindship you have always
born me, will re^^ive with kindness the last of^^e of your friend. I am in
health enough of body, and (through the mercy of God in Jesus Christ) well
disposed in mind. This I premise, that you may be satisfied that what I write
proceeds not from any fantastic terror of mind, but from a sober resolution
of what concerns my self, and earnest desire to do you more good after my
death, then mine example (God of his mercy pardon the badness of it) in my
lifetime may do you harm. I will not speak ought of the vanity of this world;
your own age and experience will save that labor: But there is a certain thing
that goes up and down the world, called Religion, dressed and pretended
phantastically, and to purposes bad enough, which yet by such evil dealing
loses not its being: The great goo^ God has not left it without ^ witness,
more or less, sooner o^ later, in every man's bosom, t^ direct us in the
pursuit of it; and for the avoiding of those inextricable disquisitions and
entanglements our own frail reasons would perplex us withal, God in his
infinite mercy has given us his Holy Word; in which as there are many things
hard to be understood, so there is enough plain and easy, to quiet our minds,
and direct us concerning our future being. I confess to God and you, I have
been a great neglecter, and (I fear) despiser of it: (God of his infinite mercy
pardon me the dreadful fault.) But when I retired my self from the noise and
deceitful vanity of the world, I found no true comfort in any other resolution,
then what I had from thence: I commend from the bottom of my heart the same to
your (I hope) happy use. Dear Sir Hugh, let us be more generous then to believe
we die as the beast that perish; but with a Christian, manly, brave resolution,
look to what is eternal. I will not trouble you farther. The only great God,
and holy God, Father, Son and holy Ghost, direct you to an happy end of your
life, and send us a joyful resurrection. So prays

Your true friend, Marleburgh.
Old James, near the coast of Holland. April 24. 1665. I beseech you commend my
love to all mine acquaintance; particularly, I pray you that my cousin Glascock
may have a sight of this Letter, and as many friends besides as you will, or
any else that desire it.

I pray grant this my request.




THis Letter, though very weighty in the matter of it, very serious in the
phrase and expression, yet is most observable for the time it was written in; a
few days before this honorable persons Soul went we hope to be happy into
another world, did he in this solemn manner of a Will and Testament, rather
than a Letter, leave his mind about the necessity of being religious in this:
It was after he had made trial of most of the great variety of opinions which
were in this licentious age broached, and had experience of most of the
vanities which have been in these loose times practiced, that recollecting
himself, and, as it becomes every rational man, (who only of all the creatures
in the world has therefore power to reflect) communing with his own heart
about his passed life which he knew was but a state of trial in order to a
future; upon serious consideration (or putting together of and dwelling upon
rational thoughts, for want whereof the thousands that perish are cast away) of
the account he saw by the frame of things made for men, men must give to the
first being that made them for them. 2. Of the invisible things of God that
were seen by the things that are made. 3. Of an immortal Soul he felt within
him, and an eternal estate expected by him. 4. Of the consent of Nations, and
the dictates of every man's own conscience attesting religion. 5. Of the
providence of God sealing it by miracles in the former ages, and owning it by
extraordinary dispensations both of mercies and judgments in the latter ages
of the world. 6. Of the experience all men have of religion on their hearts in
the comfort it affords in doing well, and the terrors it sends upon doing ill,
together with the strange success it has had by bare persuasion against the
learning, the lusts, the Laws, the Customs, and Interests of the world, and
that in the hands of men that could do no more for the propagation of it than
live up to it; and (to show they had no design) in different Countries, times,
interests, professions, Languages, and abilities, die for it. 7. Of the wisdom
of being serious and religious, considering there is no inconvenience in being
so (nay to be sober, temperate, just, loving, humble, faithful, which is to be
religious, etc. are things that carry along with them a great deal of
convenience) in this world; and a great necessity of being so, if here be, as
no man is sure there is not, another world; I say, upon serious considerations
of this and the like nature, our noble Lord looking through and beyond all that
is in this world, and of all that makes up this frame and scene of things
finding nothing likely to stay with him during his everlasting state but grace,
virtue, and true goodness, came up to these noble thoughts, which (as true
goodness is communicative) he thought the great interest of a Careless world to
know and ponder, the rather because all men arrive at these sentiments at last,
why will they not brace them at first? Ah why will any rational man live in
those things wherein no rational man dares dye? if irreligious courses be bad,
why do you, why does any ingenious person rashly enter upon them? If good, why
do all men sooner or later soberly renounce them. What is the reason that men
of understanding buy repentance so dear, when there is not a man who does not
in his latter years sadly reflect upon those things which in his younger days
he so much pleased himself in? No other can be imagined than this, that we
embrace evil courses and neglect good by fancy, opinion, and lust, the worst
judges of things for many years, the first whereof we loath, and the second we
love at last, by experience the best; and but that sin is folly, and does
infatuate as well as defile, would any thing endued with reason make that
matter of pleasure, which every body for these 6000 years has upon trial [the
best ground of knowledge] found matter of grief? or that a matter of scorn,
which all the world has experirienced the only matter of comfort? Its sad,
that after Eusebius his learned demonstrations, Justin Martyrs stout and
successeful Apologies, Tertullians pressing and close Discourses, Clemens
Alexandrinus his various Learning, his Scholar Origens sweet and powerful
reasonings, Minutius and Arnobius nervous (...) acute Tractates; and Lactantius
that Christian Cicero's flowing arguments, the School-mens convincing reasons,
besides the satisfactory and useful labors of Ludovicus Vives, the Lord Du
Plessis, Grotius, Amyrald, Ficinus, Stilling fleet, etc. of the reasonableness
of religion; any should hazard their reason, and interest so far as to make
trial whether is better, a religious or an irreligious life; but it is much
sadder that after a trial of so many thousand years as have been since the
Creation, and every man (that had the use of his reason) either while he lived
in the world, or when he departed from the world, leaving behind him this
testimony, that nothing repented him but the evil he had committed, and nothing
pleased him but the good he had done (Of the thousands whose death we have seen
or heard, what one person, though never so much besotted, ever recommended a
debauched life (to those that stood about him ready to gather his last breath)
as desirable, nay earnestly as they loved him or themselves by his own sad
example warned them not from it as mischievous? What one man in the world
repented of a good life, yea with tears for his own miscarriages did not with
all the arguments imaginable exhort to it?) I say it is much sadder that after
the experience of all men that went before us, any man should be able so far to
suppress his reason as to fall into that snare and pit of licenciousness that
all men before him warn him of: What advantage have we of living after others
and observing in their History, that however they lived they died piously, if
we become Histories our selves and g^ve others occasion to say the same things
of us that we did of our fore fathers? all the miscarriages in Arts and
Sciences, in War, peace, in Laws and Government, found by experience
inconvenient, we have cast off, retaining only those of life and manners? What
is more an argument against or for any thing than experience? And what
experience can be in this world more than that of men's whole lives? And what
declaration can there be more solemn than that of dying men; Souls even almost
separate, just freeing themselves from the burden of the body, and enlightened
with the approaches of God. An holy desire of a religious death, is not the
pang, the humor, the fancy, the fear of some men, but the serious wish of all;
many having lived wickedly, very few, in their senses died so.

Sect. 1.
. 1. For upon this occasion having recollected the ends of most men, of whom
either the Scripture of profane History has made mention, I find, besides the
many Scripture instances as 1. of Adams being ashamed and affrighted with the
guilt of sin, Genesis 3. 4, 5. as soon as he had enjoyed the pleasure of it, and
leaving to his posterity, besides seven rules of a serious religion, this
caution as the Jews There is a Book talked of amongst the Jews called
Poenitentia Adami.
report it that no man would sin if he saw from the beginning to the end of
things

2. Cain who though he is said by the Talmudist ( Ruzzia) to challenge his
brother to the field upon this assertion, that there was no other world, and no
everlasting reward to those that did well, or punishment to them that did ill,
yet overcoming his brother he was overcome of that great truth of an
everlasting state, owned by him, for fear of which he trembled, being (as the
most jolly sinners are) all his life time in bondage for fear of death: He that
stabbed half the world^ at a blow could not command the dictates of conscience
(which make them who are without Law a Law to themselves) so far as to kill the
Worm that shall never die.

3. Lamech had no sooner committed the sin of Cain (whether upon Cain's own
person, or upon some other, cannot and need not be decided) but he lived all
his days under the fear of his punishment; for Genesis 4. 23, 24. Lamech said to
his Wives (when in all probability there were none he needed to fear but them
and God) Adah and Zillah, hear my voice ye Wives of Lamech, hearken to my
speech, for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt: if
Cain shall be avenged seven fold, truly Lamech shall be avenged seveny times
seavenfold. Insomuch that men convinced by these instances of the power of a
natural conscience began then, as it follows in the text, to call on the Name
of the Lord, verse 36. (So I understand the word with Josephus Archaio the best
Antiquary in this case.) R. Eliezer in Maase-Beresithe c. 22. Cyril. orat ad
Iul. Epiph. 1. against the Targum of Jonathan: The account given of Idolatry by
Maimonid l. de cultu Stellarum and Proseld. 3. ad synt. de diis Syris.

And as appears in the instances of Enoch and Noah, men who walked with God,
and God took them.

Sect. 2.
1. And besides that sin sooner or later makes all men as well as David and
Heman have their Souls sore vexed, become weary of their groaning, while all
the night long they make their bed to swim, and water their Couch with their
tears, their eyes being consumed because of grief; and they saying how long
shall we take counsel in our Souls, having sorrow in our hearts daily; my God,
my God, why have thou forsaken me, why art thou so far from helping me and from
the words of my roaring? Remember not the sins of my youth: look upon my
affliction, and my pain, and forgive all my sins. I had fainted unless I had
believed the goodness of the Lord in the Land of the living. My life is spent
with grief and my years with sighing, my strength failed because of mine
iniquity, and my bones are consumed; when I kept silence my bones waxed old
through my roaring all the day long: for Day and Night thy hand lay heavy upon
me; I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid: I said I
will con^ess my transgressions to the Lord. For this shall every one that is
godly pray unto thee. Be not ye as the Horse and mule that have no
understanding. Many sor^ows shall be to the wicked. What man is he that desires
life, and ^oveth many days that he may see good? depart from evil and do good.
Thy arrows stick fast in me, thy ^and presses me sore: Neither is ^here any
rest in my bones by reason of my sin. I have roared for the very disquietness
of my heart. When thou with rebukes do chasten man for iniquity, thou make
his beauty to consume away. Surely every man is vanity. My sin is ever before
me: make me to hear of joy and gladness that the bones which thou have broken
may rejoice. A broken and a contrite heart, O Lord, thou will not despise.
There were they in great fear where no fear was. Fearfullness and trembling are
come upon me, and horror has overwhelmed me; and I said, O that I had wings
like a dove, for then would I flee away and be at rest. Mine eyes fai^ while I
wait upon my God. My Soul refused to be comforted. ^ remembered God and was
troubled^ I complained and my spirit was overwhelmed. My Soul is full o^
trouble, and my life draws nig^ to the grave. I am afflicted an^ ready to die
from my youth up^ while I suffer thy terrors I am di^stracted. All men, I say,
as well a^ these in the Psalms, out of which I made this collectio^, find first
or last, that sin as it has short pleasures, so it has a long sting; that
though men seem not to be able to live without the commission of it, yet are
they not able to live with the thoughts of it when committed: that as when they
have done well, the pain is short, but the pleasure lasting, so when they have
done ill, the pleasure is short, and the pain lasting. (Sin and sorrow are so
tied together by an Adamantine Chain; and the Temptation to Evil tickleth not
more than the re^lection upon it torments, when all ^he enjoyment being spent
in the acting of sin, there is now nothing ^eft but naked sin and conscience.)

Tacita sudant praecordia culpa
^ur tamen hos tu
^vasisse putes quos diri conscia ^acti
^ens habet attonitos and surdo verbere coedit;
^^cultum quatiente animo tortore flagellum,
^oena autem vehemens and multo gravior illis.
Quas and caeditius gravis invenit, ^ut Rhadamanthus,
Nocte dieque ^^um ge^^ are in pectore testem.
Not to discourse to men out of books, what they feel in their hearts, that the
things they eagerly pursue, they shall sadly lament; that evil it self, to a
rational Soul carries with it so much shame and horror, that as many Poe^s,
I^ven. etc. believed there were no Furia, Al^^tores, Eumenides, or whatever
Names were given of old to those daughters of Nemes^s or the results of men's
thought^ after sin, concerning the proceedings of the Divine justice against
it) like the conscience of having done evil, so many wise men (a^ Cicero ad
Pisonem) thought there were none besides it, and that hel^ is no other than
conscience, where^fore Judas and others ventured in^to that to avoid this;
whose wor^ that dyed not was more insupportable than the other fire that is not
quenched. Although this were enough to reclaim men from their frolicks, that
they are sure they shall be sad, although there need not more be said to a man
in his wits then this; Sir, a quiet mind is all the happiness, and a troubled
one is all the misery of this world; you cannot enjoy the pleasure, honor or
profit you imagine follows your evils with a troubled mind, and yet no man ever
followed those courses, without it: all the calamities you meet with in doing
well, are eased much by the comforts of a good conscience, And the Spirit of a
good man bears his infirmities: but all the pleasures we have in doing ^ll,
will have no relish or satisfaction, when we lie under the ^errours of a bad
one, A wo^nded spirit who can bear? But to show that a strict and a serious
life is not the humor of some conceited and singular persons, but the opinion
of all men, when they are most impartial and serious. Observe 1. The wisest
men that have been in the world, and among them. 2. Instances out of Scripture.

1. The one Nu. 23. 9, 10. The most knowing man in the East, Balaa^ the
Prophet, so much courted by Balak the Prince, reckoned the same in Mesopotamia,
that Trismegistu^ was in Egypt, or Zoroaster in Persia^ who against his own
interest the^ and his opinion, with that whol^ Countries at all times from the
high place wherein he was to de^fie all the religion that was the^ in ^the
world to please Bala^ owned it, though he displease^ him, and he took up this
pa^rable and said Balak the Kin^ of M^ab has brought me from (...) out of the
Mountains of the East, saying, curse me Jacob, an^ come defy Israel: how shall
I curse whom God has not cursed? or how shall I defy whom the Lord has not
defied: For from the top of the Rocks I see him; who can count the dust of
Jacob, and the number of the fourth part of Israel? let me dye the death of the
righteous, and my last end be like his. 2. The second 1 Kings 4. 29. ^o 34. The
most knowing man in ^he world, Solomon, to whom God gave wisdom and
understanding ^xceeding much, and largeness of ^eart, even as the sand that is
on ^he Sea^shore. And Solomon's wis^om excelled the wisdom of all the ^hildren
of the East-countrey, and ^ll the wisdom of Egypt, for he was ^iser than all
men; than Ethan the ^zrahite, and Heman, and Chal^ol, and Darda the Son of
Mahol, and his fame was in all Nations ^ound about, and he spoke three thousand
Proverbs, and his songs were a thousand and five; and he spoke of the Trees
from the Cedar Trees that are in Lebanon^ even to the Hysop that springs ou^
of the wall; he spoke also of fowle^^ of beasts, of creeping things, and o^
fi^hes. And there came of all Pe^^ple of the earth to hear the wisdom of
Solomon, from all the Kings o^ the earth which had heard of h^^ wisdom. Who
being the most e^^perienced for enquiry, the mo^^ wise for contrivance, the
mo^^ wealthy for compassing all the s^^tisfaction that can be had in t^^ things
of this world, after man^ years sifting (for says he in Eccl^^ that his Book
of repentance, Cha^^ 2. verse. 1. I said in my heart, g^ to now, I will prove
thee wi^ mirth, therefore enjoy pleasur^ therefore Chap. 1. verse. 17. gave my
heart to know wisdom and to know madness and folly^ that there was in Learning,
Ho^^our, Pleasure, Peace, Plenty mag^ificent, entertainments, For^eign
supplies, Royal visits, Noble ^onfederacies, variety and abun^ance of sumptuous
provisions, and ^elicate Diet, 1 King 4. 91. 10.
stately ^difices, and rich Vine^ards, Orchards, Fish Ponds, and ^oods,
numerous attendants, vast ^reasures, of which he had the ^ost free,
undisturbed, and una^ted enjoyment, for he says, he ^^th-held not his heart
from any ^^y: after several years, not only ^^^suall, but Critical fruition, to
^^d out as he says, that good ^^ich God has given men under ^^e Sun, after he
had tortured Na^^re to extract the most exquisite ^^irits, and pure
quintescence, ^^ich the varieties of the Crea^^^e, the all that is in the
world, ^^e lust of the ^^esh, the lust of the ^^e, and the pride of Life, at
last pronounces them all vanity, and vexation of Spirit, and leaves thi^
instruction behind, for late Poste^rities, Let us hear the conclusion of the
whole matter, fear God an^ keep his commandments, For this is the whole duty
of man; for God will bring every work in^ judgment, with every secret thin^
whether it be good, or whether it evil, Eccles. 12. 13, 14. Is it n^^ cheaper
believing this, than (...) loose a brave Life, wherein a m^^ cannot err twice
in the sad trya^ and at last with tears and groa^ own this conclusion?
II. These following out such other records as we ha^^ next the Scripture;
waving the u^^certain Cabala, and the Fabul^ Talmud of the Jews, who bring men
seriously to confess at (...) that it had been their interest be good at first.
In the famo^^ words of the wise Son of Sira^^ (...) man who profited in the
Jewish ^earning above his fellows, Wisd. 5. ^, 5, 6, 7. We fools counted their
^^fe madness, and their end to be without honor; how are they ^umbred among
the children of ^od, and their lot among the ^aints? We wearied our selves in
the way of wickedness and destruction? What has pride profited us, or what
good has riches with our vaunting brought us; all these are past away as the
shadow, and as a post that hastes by, but the Souls of the righteous are in
the hand of God; in the sight of the unwise they seem to dye; and their
departure is taken for misery, and their going from us to be utter destruction,
but they are in Peace: for though they be punished in the sight of men, yet is
their hope full of immortality, and having been a little chasti^ed, they are
greatly rewarded^ ^or God proved them and found them worthy of him self. I say
these following exam^ples, we will take out of the^^ Histories, viz.

1. The Phenician history (...) Sanconiathon, as it is translated b^
Philo-biblius, and quoted by Po^phyry, Hist. Phaen. p. 112.
where Mast^^ Kircher out of Ierub^a^^ the Priest of the God Ia^, that Jehovah,
and other public r^^cords and inscriptions, speaking (...) the religious end
of the wise m^^ of those times, brings in two d^^^coursing to this effect.

Quest. Is there another wo^^ or state?

Answ. I am willing there shou^ not, but I am not sure there not.

Quest. Why, are you willi^^ there should not?

Answ. Because I have not liv^ in this state, so well as to have hope to be
happy in another.

Quest. Rememb. the end, and thou shall never do amiss. Ecclus.
What a madness was it in you when your reason dictated to ^ou, that there
might be another world, to live as if you had ^een sure there were none.

Answ. If men could look to their ^eginning or ending, they would ^ever fail in
the middle.

Quest. Then it is the safest way ^o be good.

Answ. It can do no harm, it ^ay do good.

2. The supposed Egyptian writers, ^uch as, first, Hermes Trismegistus, ^ho in
his old age is brought in ^ith a serious Dialogue of Religi^^, to make amend
for the vain ^^eces of history he had writ in his ^outh, and among many other
^^ings, Mantho pretends to, from (...) inscriptions, this is very consi^^^^^le.

1. That there was some great reason, not yet well understood why men enjoyed
their pleasure^ with fear; why most men's death is a repentance of life; why n^
man is contented in this life; wh^ men have infinite wishes, and wh^^ther those
that dream when the^ are asleep, shall not live when the^ are dead.

3. The Caldeans, such as Zor^aster and the Zabij, by the visibl^ things that
are seen, the Sun, the Moon, the Stars, (which as Ma^^monides speaks of them,
we^^ their books) saw so much into t^^ invisible things of God, his wi^^dom and
power, that their o^^ men, as Kircher speaks somewher^ durst not dye before
they h^^ been by sacrifices reconciled (...) him by whom they lived.

4. And besides that Tertullia^ l. de. Prescript. Cont. Her. I. Mart^ Apol. II^
Clem. Alex. Strom. 5. ^^f^ Prep. Evan. 10. of old, and Vossius de orig. Idol.
Grotius de verit. Christ. Rel. Bochart Geog. Sacra of late have taught us, that
the fables of the Greek Heathenism, are but the depraved and corrupted truth of
Jewish Religion; there is not an eminent man among the Grecians that dies a
heathen or an infidel, though he lived so. Heraclides, Ponticus, Antisthenes,
Democritus, and his Scholar Pithagoras, a little before their deaths writ
books, (...) about them that lived in the invisible state, which they profess
they thought not of in their lives.

1. Socrates, whom we set here now, as the Oracle placed him formerly, by
himself, reckoned therefore the wisest man of his time, Diog. Laert. p. 42. Ed.
Romans Zan.
because he brought Philosophy from the obscure and uncertain Speculations of
nature to useful conderations of virtue; in all hi^ discourses recommended
goodness, Plutarch.
as the trues^ wisdom; although he confesse^ (...), etc. that h^ had no perfect
knowledge of thos^ who were in the invisible state yet among other great
di^course he made between his condemna^tion and death, (collected by Plat^ in
his Phaedone, that is, a discours^ of the immortality of the soul, an^ Apology
for Socrates p. 31. Edi^^ Franc.) This was very consid^^rable, (...) etc.
certainly says he, death mu^^ be one of these two, either a being utterly
insensible, or a passag^ into some other place. If the first, then it is a
pleasant rest, lik^ an undisturbed sleep; but dying Souls go into other
h^^bitations as its certain they wi^^ then I shall go from before the^ Judges
to higher, and there co^^verse with Orpheus, Musaeus, Hesiod, Homer; how often
would I have died to see how they liv^^ how pleasantly shall I dwell with
Palamedes and Ajax equal in the enjoyments of another World; as we have been in
the injuries of this^ both happy in that we shall be everlastingly so. Death
differs nothing from life; and he may be sure to live well that lived justly,
approving himself not to giddy men, but to that one wise God who is truth (his
choice words are (...) concluding his life with these expressions (after he had
been accused for being one who did (...) too curi^usly enquire into the state
of things above the Heavens and ^elow the earth, Apol. 2. p. 8. Clem. Alex.

and for bearing to the truth of one God; (for which Justin Martyr and other^

act^d according to his own reason) It is time for me to go and die, and you to
live (...) which is best, Plut. Apol. Soc. 31.
is known to God.

2. Xenophon who in his life time did nothing without Socrates advise was at
his death of his opinion^ for after several years spent in Cyrus his Court and
Camp and reflecting on the manly pleasures, as Hunting, Riding, etc. which he
practiced as well as writ of, he left this^ Memento among his friends, that in
the midst of his delights he had this grief, Genesis Bib. p. 564.
that he doubted the^^ was no place for these dive^tisements in the upper
world, and that wise Souls should begin^ betimes those exercises which shall
last ever, Cause. de ^l. l. ^. c. 35.
exercises pure and eternal as spirits, words to be as much esteemed by us as
his Cyropaedia was by Scipio Affricanus; the graces as appears by these
sentences dwelling in his mouth as they said the Muses did.

3. Eschines a fluent and stately Orator ( Quint. Inst. 10. c. 1.) being
questioned for dispersing Socrates his books, Degrees. where me^h. Leg. Hist. Pho.
Bibl. p. 1463.
made Socrates his answer, that he was not afraid to dye for scattering
instructions among men to teach them to live, Being ashamed of nothing more
than that he advised Socrates to fly, when no man should be afraid to dye but
he that might be ashamed to live; adding that life was a thing which none
almost understood but those that were ready ^o leave it.

4. Thales the first of the seven wise men, before whom none taught ^he motions
of the Heavens so clearly, says Eudemus, and none proved the immortality of
the soul so evidently, Dio^. La^^. p. c.
says Chaerilus though he showed by his foresight of a dear year, and the
provision he brought in against it, that a Philosopher might be rich; yet he
convinced men by his foresight of another world, that they need not, blessing
God that he was a knowing Grecian, not an ignorant Barbarian, and a rational
man, not a beast; he professed at his death that he had studied all his life
for the ancientest thing in the world, and he found it was God; What was the
most lasting thing about him, and it was his Soul? What wa^ best, and he found
it was tha^ which was eternal; what was hardest, and he found it was to know
himself; What was wisest, he found it was time; and as the Epitaph says of him
(...), etc. The Stars which for age he could not see on the earth, he was taken
up nearer to see them in Heaven.

5. Solon having done the greatest services to, and received the greatest
injuries from his native Country, Plut. Apoth.
said that man had the hardest measure of any Creature, if he lived but
threescore; and admonished Craesus swimming in the greatest affluence of
enjoyments and pleasures imagi^able, that he should not be happy ^ill he ceased
to be, who esteemed ^is words as little as he under^^ood them, till deprived of
all things, but his reason^ and conside^ation, he cried, O Solon, Solon, thou
^^rt in the right.

6. Chilon trusted in the sixty fifth Olympiad with the extraordinary power of
Ephorus, or Lord High Constable in Sparta, and so jovial a man, that I think he
dyed with excessive joy, being asked what the difference was between the
learned, and the unlearned, at last? Answered ((...)) good hope, -- (...), etc.
He being of opinion that a foresight of things to come, was all a man's virtue
for the present; and that an honest loss was to be preferred before a dishonest
gain, for this reason, because the sadness that follows the first, is but for
once; but that which follows the other perpetual: to which I may add Pittacus
his sentence much used by him, who being demanded what was the best thing in
the world, replied (...)^ to perform well a man^ present duty; (...), Know thy
opportunity, being his Apoththegm.

7. Bias, (who going with some wicked men that prayed in a storm, entreated
them to be silent least the gods should hear them; and being asked by one of
them, what that piety he talked of meant, he held his peace, saying, it was to
no purpose to speak to a man of those things that he never purposed to
practice) bequeathed this instruction to those tha^ survived him ((...)) that
we should measure life, so as ^f we were to live a very little, and a very
great while; from which principle his friend Clebu^^s on his death bed inferred
this ^onclusion, Athen deip. 106.

that those ^^en only lived to any ^urpose, who did (...), etc. overcome
^leasure, make virtue ^^mil^ar, and vice a stranger; the great rule of life,
being as he^ said (...) and the great work of it medi^ation, according to that
of hi^ contemporary P^riander (who hated pleasures which were not immortal)
(...), Meditation is all.

8. Anacharsis the ^e^thian to de^er young men from tasting pleasures, by the
ill effects of them he felt, when old, ^^me^ He^. Subse^.
left this saying behind him, (...) etc. that the vin^ bore three branches, or
clusters^ on the first^ whereof grew pleasure, on the second sottishness, on
the third sadness: yea Pherecides himself, otherwise no very seriou^ man,
hearing one saying, that he had lived well, answered (...) I wish you may dye
well; an^ being asked, why he said so, be ca^^^e, returned he, we Live to Dy^
and Dye to Live.

9. Those Ionick Philosophers the hearers of Thales (who as Diod. sic. l. 1.
affirms, went into Egypt and the other knowing parts of the world, to be
acquainted with all the Learning and Laws then in being, conveyed by a
genuine Cabbala and tradition from the Founders of mankind) among other useful
considerations that they had at the close of their lives (when as Ar aeus
affirms in Hie ron^ Mercurialis his Variae lectiones, (...) etc. Those that
are sick at heart have their senses more quick, their thoughts more free, their
minds more enlightened, their hearts more pure, their reason better settled,
their imaginations more divine) these were most remarkable 1. Anaxi^anders
saying on his death bed (...) that infinity he found, after much study, was the
beginn^ng of all things, and thence concluding it must be the end, wishing when
he had studied the Sphere much, that he might dwell in it, and comforting
himself when he saw time passing away on the Dyall he made (for he was thought
the first inventor of Dialls) that he was born for eternity. 2. his Scholar
Anaximenes being asked how he could study confined to a Prison and expecting
death, answered that his soul was not confined, having as large a walk as the
heavens he studied, nor frighted, having as great a hope as immortality which
he looked for.

3. His hearer Anaxagoras (as I have it from simplic: his comment upon
Aristotle, Cicero's Tuscalan^ 1. Et Not. Deor.) who first (to use Aristotle's
words l. 8^ (...)) observed tha^ there was an eternal mind movin^ the material
world, whence h^ himself was called Mind, being seriously expostulated with for
retyring as he did a little before his death, and neglecting the care of his
Country rejoyed (...) I have now the greatest care of all of my Country,
pointing at Heaven, of which he said to one that was sorry he must dye in a
foreign Country, you may go from any place to Heaven; and being demanded when
he was dying, what he was born for, he answered, to contemplate the Sun, the
Moon, and Heaven while I live, and to dwell ^here when I am dead; Diog. La^r. 4.
at the thoughts of which he was so raised that when he was informed in one
hour that he himself was condemned and his ^on dead, he said no more him, 1.
That Nature had con^emned his judges. 2. And that (...) knew when he begot his
son that he had begotten one that should dye. And when he was to dye he
required of the Citizens (who desired to know what he would have them do for
him) that the boys should play every year on the day of his death.

4. The Droll and great actor Aristippus, who for his flattery and luxury was
called the Kings dog, being asked before his death what wa^ the difference
between; a Philosopher, and another man, answered, (...), etc. though there were
no Laws, we should live a^ we do; Idem. Ibid.
and another tim^ he said it was a brave thing to use no pleasures at all, but
to overcome them: as when in a discourse about Socrates his way o^ dying, he
said that that man dye^ as he desired; and that it would never be well in the
world unti^ ^oys learned those things which they were to use when men, an^ men
learned those things which they were to practice when happy, in the attainment
of the end of good men, which he said was (...) i. e. (if I understand him
right, though with the help of Cicero's translation. Tusc. quaest. l. 1.) A
sweet motion toward an immutable fruition. Athen. 13. c. 28. 5. 5.
Nay mad Theod. himself, wh^ writ no contemptible books, if we may believe the
above cited Author, against the gods, and a while believed himself a God, yet
at last comes to this conclusion, viz. That the end of good men was joy, and of
bad men sorrow, the first the effect of prudence, and the other of folly. And
that most solid man Euclid. of Megara, who reduced Phyloso^hy from loose
discourses, to ^lose and cohaerent reasonings, ^itched after much enquiry upon
this conclusion, which is to be ^een in Tully Arcad. Quest. l. 2. That there
was but one good, which some called Prudence, others Mind, others ^od; see
Ramus his Pref. to Schol. Math^ G. Neander Geog. p. 1. Blan^ Disert. de Not.
Math. Sa^il. Lect. 1. Eucl. Not to mention a discourse to the same purpose
which may be seen at large in his contemporary Cebes, to whom of the
Socratiques I shall add only Menedemus, who being told on hi^ death bed that
he was a happ^ man that attained to what h^ designed, answered, (...) that he
was happi^ who desired not more than he ough^ which puts me in mind of an
o^servation (much to our purpos^^ which those which will hard^^ believe should
seriously conside^ gathered by Dr. M. Cas^ab. En^ p. 60. out of the Author of
t^^ History of the Counsel of Tre^^ Solenne in Confinio mortir positis ^
humanas ex ignota quadam and sup^^ naturali causa fastidere, that it is an
usual thing for men however ensnared in the world all their lives, at their
deaths to loath the things of it, from an unknown and supernatural cause,
meaning no doubt depth of prudence and height of religion.

10. The founder of the Academy Plato, who was surnamed (...), vid. Plat.
Timaeu. Plut. l. 8. (...). Aug. 8. ^. D. c. 11. c^rsigon. de temp. Ather. Xen.
l. 3. (...). Pha vor. l. 1. comment. Plato died crying (...).
though the accutest and smoothest writer of his time himself ( Quint. inst.
orat. l. 10. c. 1.) yet when sick was more taken with this plain verse of
Epicharmus (...), etc. The Gods always were, and always will be, their being
never beginning and never ceasing, than with all his own composition; of all
which, he ^poke of none with ^ver after, th^^ he could not get (...) ^ho^ght (
that he should (...) a beast, and wa^ (...) ^e should have (...) longer to live
a man) (...) of his mind; wherefore Crate^ (...) away all his estate that he

other than a contemplation of death: And Cranto^ ga^e himself so much to the
stu^dy^ of good and evil with their consequence, that his book of tha^ subject
bequeathed by him t^ po^^erity, is by Cicero and Panaeti^us^ Master or Friend
to Tubero^ ^^lled non magnus, at aureolus (...) ^ui ad verbum, ediscendus. A^
^^e reading of which Carneade (who disputed many years against the motion of
good and evil and Che^ilaus, (who prote^ted h^ knew for many years nothin^
that was good, but what w^^ pleasant; and nothing that was evil, but what was
unpleasant) both durst not die sober without a great draught of Wine, because
they said no voluptuous man could go in his wits to an invisible state. And to
mention no more Platonists: Athen. l. 13. c. 23.
^ion, a Cynech indeed rather than an Academick. said, that the torments of
evil men in the other life were greater than any man imagined in ^his, and
though he had defied ^he Gods a while, deriding their worshippers and never
^ouchsafing to look into their Temples, yet when he fell sick he ^ormented his
body with exquisite ^enance, as thorns, thonges, etc, (...) that he might
repent of what ^e had done against the Gods, those Altars he filled, when dy^g,
with sacrifices, and their ears with petitions and confessions ((...))
Laerti^^ feared in vain^ then wise when he was just r^^dy to say. (...) good
morrow P^utus.

11. Aristotle, when he came to the end of his walk and life, (however he was
for the eternity of the world, thinking it inconceivable that things should be
any otherwise than they are; Elian l. 2^ va. Hist. c. 9. ^l. 1^ Curt. l. ^
and that there can be no production but in a ordinary way of ou^ generation,
measuring the origin^ of the world by the present stat^ of it) thought God was
a separate^ being, the cause o^ all motion, (...) Phy. l. 8.
himse^^ one^ immovable an^ therefore only eternal, that ther^ was a
providence which Craca^^thorp proves at the sam^ time that the book Mundo is
his, Providen^ia^ E^a^^. ep. l^ 28. ep. mono Ludov vives de Cause. Corr^pt. vid.
Arist. Dorj. Evesta. p. 111,
and with ^ that reason which he reduced into the exactest method and rules of
any man, he could not pitch upon a greater comfort in a dying hour, than that
of Ens entium^ mei miserere, thou being of beings, have mercy upon me. Yea
Ocellus Lucanus himself (to whose book (...), Aristotle was so much beholding,
though he acknowledges not by whom he profited,) says that though he could not
see how the world had a beginning, yet could not he dye without fear and
reverence of one by whom all things had a beginning.

2. His Scholar Theoph^a stus, in Laertius, Suidas in voci Theophrastus, Athen
(...) vid. Causab. in Theoph. Char Proleg.
having bewailed the expense of time, gave this reason for it, viz. That we are
so foolishly senual, that we begin not to live, until we begin to dye. Cicero,
who called him always his delight, in his Tusc. quest. l. 4. says, that
Theophrastus dying complained of nature, that it gave long life to creatures
whom it little concerned to be long-lived, and so short a life to men, who are
so much concerned, weeping that he no sooner saw this by much study and
experience, but he must dye, saying, (...) That the vanity of life was more
than the profit of it; I have no time to consider what I should do^ ^ speaking
to those that were about him at his death) you have -- which words, stuck so
close to hi^ Scholar and successor Strato^ that he studied himself to a
Skel^^ton about the nature o^ spirits, Dequil^ accu^i^^me scriptsit.
the glory ^^ heaven, the chief goo^ and the blessed life, which be^cause he
could not comprehen^ he desired it should comprehend him. Cic. in Lucullus
Plut. lib. (...) Eusebius. in Chron.) and to his successor Lycon, who said on his
death bed, that it was the most foolish thing in the world to repent, and wish
for, Videt Athens l. 12. c. 270. 171.
as most men do, that time which cannot be recalled; to whom I may add out of
Cael. Rhodiginus, l. 29. c. 5. Demetrius, who said, that when he was a child at
home, he reverenced his Parents; Vid. I har. var. his^. 12. c. 43.
when a man abroad, the people and the Magistrates; and when an old man and
retired, himself: which advise being followed by Heraclide^, when he felt
himself sick put him upon writing his books of the Heavens, of those who are in
hell, of temperance, piety, and the chief good.

12. Among the Cynicks, 1. Antisthc^e^, who though in jest ^he bid the man who
was discoursing of the happy (...) of then in another^ world, dye himself, yet
afterward he used to assert (...) (...) he had rather be punished^ with madnes^
than enjoy pleasure, adding, when sick, this ^^^^ence (...), Laertius 130.
that those who would be hereafter immortal, must be here godly and just.

2. Diogenes grounded all his Cynical and an^tere re^gards of this world up^on
this pleasant con^templation (...) etc. that all things were the gods; Vid.
Vocebus ^^^^^sthenes, (...) et^ ^^ian var^ hist. ^. 10. c. (...) Diogenes
(...). l. 6. (...) 6. 147^ etc.
an^ that wise^men we^ the gods friends, and therefore that all things belonged
to wi^^ and good men, whom he though the image of the Gods. To a man on a sick
^ed complaining the life was a sad thing, he answered, Yes a bad one is so,
because it is but a tampering of the body, when it should be the exercise of
the mind, which he inculcated so much to his Auditors, that his disciple
Monimus counterfeited himself mad, that he might be at Liberty from his master,
to study truth and virtue (abhorring luxury and drunkenness, as madness
indeed.) with Crates, who comforted a mocked but good man with these words,
(...), etc. those that make themselves so merry with thee, thou shall see one
day sadly calling thee, the blessed man for thy virtue, and themselves wretched
for their sloth, thou being one of those good men who want few things, because
they are like the gods that want nothing^

Indeed Religion had such a power over these Cynicks, that one of them by name
Menedemus, as Laertius calls him, and Menippus as Snid^s (in verbo (...)) out
of a zeal against the looseness of his time, walked up and down in the habit of
a fury, declaring himself a spectator of men's exorbitances on earth, sent on
purpose to be a witness against them in hell.

13. The Stoics among whom Zeno was looked upon as the chieftain, ^uid. in
vo^. ^estrot
came after a world of reasonings (which you will find in ^ully, Seneca,
Autoninus, Lipsi^s, ^lutarch, de com. notion. ad stoicos de placitis Phil.
Epictetus, Hiero^le^) and subtlety (which you may observe in Diog. Laertius his
Zeno, l. 7. p. 185. and ed. Rom.) To these great conclusions, 1. That the great
end of man was to have the pleasure of living according to right reason, the
daughter of Jove, the great mode^rator of all things, to whose will it is good
men's pleasure and all men's necessity to submit. 2. That virtue is the
regulating of passions and affections, by reason: for indeed I think the
Stoics did no more aim at the destruction of natural affections, by their
discourses of apathy, than Saint Paul, Lumb. to l. 3. did. 15. Aq. p. 3. q.
15. art. 4. Lad l. 6. c. 14.
by his exhortation, to mortify the flesh with the affections and lust, both
aiming at the reducing of the disorder, and the raising of the nature of our
faculties, that the wisdom of virtue should so compose and consolidate the
mind, and settle it in such stability and resolution, that it should not at all
be bended from the right, by any sensitive perturbations or impul^ions. 3. That
the consequence of goodness, was calmness and serenity; and of evil, fear,
bondage, grief, Aul. C. l. 19. c. 1. Cic. Tu^. 4. l. 4. Sen. ep. 85. de. ^ra^
l. 9. c. Cic. de ^in. l. 4. Aq. 22. de q. 24. Art. 2. 3. Clem. Alex. Padag 2.
13. L^ert. Zeno l. 7.
stupidity. 4. That that was only good, which was honest, desirable for it
self, satisfactory, and lasting. ^. That nothing base was truly pleasant. 6.
That all disorders of the soul proceed from misapprehensions of the
understanding, and con^inue by disturbing and clouding ^^^son, which they say
is in them, (...) of God, whom it represent^^, they say, so as he is wicked,
(...) dares displease him, and he a mad man that dares doubt of him^ 7. That
the good man is free and happy in the worst condition, Vi^. Phi^^ (...)
and the bad a slave in the best; virtue being sufficient in it self to render
happy, and vice so to make men miserable, and that all things are unalterably
ordered by the eternal mind: In testimony whereof a man need only go over the
several Titles of Chrysippus his sober and good books mentioned by Laertius in
his ninth book, which I will not transcribe, ne Chrysippi, Sarinia compilasse
videar, being contented with that of Horace concerning Homer and himself, Quid
sit pulchrum, quid turpe, quid utile, quid non Before and melius Chrysippo aut
Grantore dicit.


14. Pythagoras, (who traveld into Egypt for learning; and if we believe
Origin. Clem. of Alex. Porph. and others to be seen in Seldons book de jur.
Not. el. gentium apud Hebraeos. l. 1. c. 2. converse with the Jews in Chaldea,
yea, and if we listen to Vossius, c. 6.. 5. de sectis Philosoph. with Elisha
^^n: Mount Carmel.) Summed up ^is observation into this con^lusion.

1. That there were two principles of all things (...), etc. An active and a
forming principle, Vid. Jamb. Sect. Pyth. comment. S^mp. ut et. ^^rianin epict.
^alch. vit. Pythag. aldro^^^d^^ 9. de lib. D. Laert.
which is the Mind or God by all to be worshipped.

2. The other (...), etc. the passive principle, which was not to be regarded.
2. That he himself came from the infernal Mansions some years past, and must
return (see Horace Carm. l. ^. od. de Archita Tarenti^o. 3. That he had found
one to be the beginning and end o^ all things, which he said were man aged by
fate as men we^^ by providence. 4. That ther^ should be a separation of Souls,
their pure immortal Souls being carried up to the highest feat^ and the impure
to the lowest i^ the World, never t^ approach the other, La^r. 2. p. 21. Herod.

al^wayes to be tormented with furies and chains, among themselves; and and
Plutarch brings in Pythagoras asserting the immortality of the Soul, and giving
this quaint reason for it, (...), because it must return to the Soul of the
World as to first and most perfect of its kind.

5. That the greatest good or evil amongst men, was opinion or persuasion.
Empedo cles one of his followers, hearing a discourse of the immortality of the
Soul, ^n his old age threw himself into ^he flames of AEtna to enjoy it. S^idas
in voce (...) ep. de (...) poet.)

15. When Heraclitus ^^d all his lifetime wept ^t the folly of makind, Suidas
Plin. c. 19.
he was at last asked this question, wherein consisted true wisdom? to which he
gave this answer, (...) that it was the only wisdom in the World to know that
mind that governed all things and (to use his friend Xenophon's words, Laer.
p. 24. 1.) is all eye, Vid. Sta. ^ el. and sont. Gr. el. Lat.
and all ear, all things at once, Omniscient, Omnipotent and Eternal; and as
Melissus thought (in Simplic. his Comment on the first of Aristotl^^ Physic)
not to be rashly spoken of, because not fully known.

16. And when Democritus had all his life time laughed at the folly of mankind,
he at last stated the happiness of man, to lie in the se^enity of the mind; and
being to dye, he prolonged his life b^ many applications for three days that he
might live to pay h^^ d^^votion to the great goddess, an^ depart upon her
solemnity: Ye^ when he and Epicurus loathing the absurd notions men had by
poetry, etc. Entertained of the heathen Gods, (for they with Dyonisius,
Diagoras, Theodorus, and others, then called (...) Atheists, got that name
rather by jeering the ridiculous Polutheism of those times than by denying that
Religion which is supported by the consent of all times) set their
Philosophical wits on work to salve the appearances of nature, without the true
God, by asserting the beginning of the world, from a lucky conflu^nce of
infinite little particles, called Atoms, and that so confidently that
Lucretius, who put those Atoms into the best order, and ^^n^est poem of any I
know, in hi^ shrewd book de nature a rerum (but be it remembered, that that
great and witty Epicurean lived and dyed a mad man, (and I think with
Mirandula, there is no Aheist in the world in his wits) Ge^eh. Chron. l. 2.
Pet. Crinit. de Poeti^ latinis, l. 2. c. 19.) affirms Epicu^rus to be the first
Giant that tollere contra est oculos ausus, tha^ d^rst encounter, and did
overthrow that notion of the Gods, that had for so many years opp^^ssed, and
kept under the free t^oughts of men; Yet Catta in Cic. d^ ^^t. deorum l. 1. c.
86. report that they were so far from gainin^ their beloved ease, pleasure, and
the carnal security of the beast which perisheth^ that never was a School b^y
more afraid of a r^d than on^ of them, Epicurus by name was o^ the thoughts of
a God and Death ^^c quenquam vidi, (they are C^tta^ ^ords) ^ui magis ea quae
ti^en^^ ^sse ^egaret, timeret, mort^^ di^ and deos. So hard it is (says Maste^
S^illing fleet upon these words, e^^cellently, as he does in all his
di^^course^ (whose life God long pr^^serve for the good and service of his
Church) for an Epicurean, even after he has prostituted his conscience, to
silence, it but (whatever there be in the air) there is an elastical power in
the conscience, that will bear its self up notwithstanding the weight that is
laid upon it. Yea Epicurus his followers confess that it is to no purpose to
endeavor the ^ooting out wholly of the belief of ^ deity out of the World,
because of the unanimous consent of the World in it; and there he admits ^his
as a principle quod in omni^^ animis deorum notionem im^resset ipsa Natura,
that Nature ^ts self had stamped an Idea upon ^h^ minds of men, and that upon
this ground, cum enim non in^tituto aliquo, aut more, aut lege ^it opino
constituta, manet atque ^na omnium consensio, intelligi ^ecesse est Deos esse,
quoniam insitas eorum^ vel potuis in nata^ cogitationes habemus; de quo au^em
omnium natura consentit id verum esse necesse est; i. e. (The^ are an
Epic^reans own words) Since the belief of a deity neithe^ rose from Custom,
nor was enacted by Law, yet is unanimously assented to by all mankind, i^
necessarily follows, that there must be a deity, because the Ide^ of it is so
natural to us, that thoug^ it be very troublesome to man^ men, yet could it be
laid aside b^ none as it might, if there had be^ no God. For as the stoics
urg^ very well, if there were no Go^ considering the wishes of some and the
abilities of others, (...) overthrow such a false notio^ non tam stabilis
opinio permaner^ nec confirmaretur diuturnita^ temporis, nec una cum seculis
aet a^^bu^que hominum inveterare potuiss^^ ^^e. Not. deor. l. 2. vid. Gass^^
Tom. 2. l. 3.

17. Although Protagoras the Sceptick begins his book of the gods in this
doubtful manner (...), etc. Luer. 150. and 153.
As for the gods, I know not whether they be or be not; yet he and Pyrrhon the
Master of the Scepticks being asked why they walked alone so much? answered,
that it was to meditate how they might be good; and being urged again, what
necessity there was of being good, since it was not certain that there was a
God? they used ^o reply, it cannot be certain ^here is not, and it being an
even ^ay between the serious and good, and the vain and bad man, that ^here is
a God, though upon wo^ull odds, the good man hazzard^ng only the loss of his
lusts (which ^t is his interest to be without) or ^t furthest, some little
advantage, ^eing in this world at more rest and inward serenity, more
healthful, re^pected, befriended, secure and free; and in the other, if there
be not a God, as happy as the bad^ but if there be, Dr. Till^s^on, etc. A man
born to add Perspicuity to the strength of Religion.
infinitely as much happier, as an unspeak^able and eternal blessedness is
beyond extreme and endles^ Torments.

So that (as an excellent person says) if the Arguments for an^ against a God
were equal, and (...) were an even Question whethe^ there were one or not; yet
the hazard and danger is so infinite^ly unequal, that in point of pru^dence
every man is bound to stic^ to the safest side of the Question and make that
his Hypothesis (...) to live by. For he that acts wis^^ly, and is a
thorowly-prude^ man, will be provided in omne^ ^^^^tum, and will take care to
s^^cure the main chance, whatev^^ happens: But the Atheist, in case things
should fall out contrary to his belief and expectation, he has made no
provision in this case. If, contrary to his confidence, it should prove in the
issue that there is a God, the man is lost and undone for ever. If the Atheist,
when he dies, finds that his soul has only quitted its lodging, and remains
after the body; that a sad surprise will it be, to find himself among a world
of spirits ^ntred on an everlasting and an ^nchangeable state!

Yea, Pyrrhon himself would ^ften repeat that of Euripides, (...), etc. who
knows ^ut to dye is to live, and to live ^s to dye? and therefore Epicurus
himself in his letter to Meneceus, ^aith, he observes him a fool who ^s vain
at death, wherein because of ^he consequence ((...), ^aith he) there is no
jesting, it being (...) infinite concernment to be serious; in fine, it appears
from (...), Berg^^ius, Theol^gen^ium^ ^^ym. de s^bud. Theol. Nat^ (...),
E^gusb. Perenni. Philos. and others, that all the learned men in the world
found, as Ci^^ d^ Not. deor. l. 1. et de leg. 2. that th^^ notion of God and
Religion i^ the first notion that is engraven in^ and the last that is defaced
out o^ the minds of men; and that, tak^ away the being and providence (...)
God^ out of the World, you take ^^way all reason, faith, virtue, peac^ y^a and
humane society; yea all men though never so barbarous an^ (...), have been
Religious; an^ though they had neither Art^ nor Laws, nor Letters, yet h^^
Gods. See Benzon Hist. de^ occi^ Indi a Acostas, both Eman. an^ Joseph Hist.

many have odd imaginations of ^he diety from ill habits, but all ^ind there is
a Divine power, by ^ure reason, etc. Thinking it un^easonable, as the same
Heathen ^oeth on, that all m^n should be^ieve there is a mind and reason ^n

quoting Orpheus, the Sybils, Sophocles, Hom. etc. to this very purpose. So that
we see there was never any man, that to enjoy his pleasures stifled his
Religion, but at last after thoughts of Religion, stifled his pleasures, this
being one argument of the Divinity of the Soul which is another argument of the
being of God, that it can and does correct sooner or later, loose men's
imaginations concerning this world, and the next; And that reason does at last
form apprehen^ions of things quite different from those conveyed at first by
sense. But how can any man live securely upon the principles of Atheism^ when

look for in another World, though never so secure, and the rewards good men may
expect, though never so much discouraged, were so inwoven into the first
thoughts of men, and looked upon as of so great concernment to common life, and
society, that the Jews who have kept the tradition of religion the best of any,

World. See Talmud. Tract. Nedarim. and Pesae^him and Pirt. R. Eleas. c. 3.

Jonah ben. Levi in his Tikune Sockar fol. 63. Col. 1. et. 2. affirms that
most of the Rabbis said, they were to go when dying, as do most of the
Talmudists as we may find in Constant L. Emperor, who made a key to them; yea,
and Mahomet himself in his Alcoran, that Oglio Iudaisme, Groecism and
Neorianism, surat 2. ver. 22. as in his Dialogue with Sinan discourses of a
blessed state of good men begun in the inward pleasures of good men here, and
perfected in their everlasting pleasures hereafter. It is a great argument to
all men to live as if they believed a future state, that these men who had so
little knowledge of it, by reason of their corrupt reason, as to describe it
foolishly, yet had so much knowledge of it by natural reason, as to own it, and
that so far as to believe tha^ all the poetical descriptions of Paradise, and
Elysium, in the Hebrew and Arabian Authors in the Greek and Latin Poets are
Allegories of a more Spiritual state, and so the Persian Ali, and his faction
understands Mahomet; and divine Plat^ in many places understands the Hellenists
expressing (in Phaedro) the feast of the Soul in contemplating the first and
real being, as divinely as the Jews do, the happiness of it in the beholding
the Shecinah, or the light of the countenance of the King of life, or the
Christians in the beatifick vision: and concluding that all good men have a

Israelite has a part in the world to come; all men with Socrates expect a

monuments and examples, that Common sentence of the Rabbines being the common
sense of mankind (...), and^. there is no place after death for repentance: so
much there was of the sense of Religion upon these men, otherwise ignorant
enough, that a learned Arabian, when dying considering the contradiction of the
Practices of men in this worl^ with the notion all me have of another World,
breathed out his ^oul in this wish, Sit anima mea cum Philosophis, Be my soul
with the Philosophers: The same man being pleased much with the Egyptian
Hierogliphyck of the Soul which was a Pyramid and the correspondence thus, As a
Pyramid (if it be turned about its Axis, the Axis continuing still the same is

In a discourse concerning the resurrection had before Iuli^^ Caesar the
Emperor, at which (...) Gamaliel was present, Cleopat^^ the Queen asked R.
Meir a^^ said, we know that they that lie down shall live because it is
written, see Came Hist. med^r c. 73. Sym, Groular. Hist. mem. 2.
and they shall spring out of the City like the herb of the ground, but when
they stand up from the dead shall they rise up naked or clothed? he said unto
her, Valmechonier ( i. e. argumentum a minori ad Majus, aut e contra) from the
Wheat; the Wheat is buried naked, and yet rises up very well Clad, how much
more the just men who are buried in their Clothes; Caesar said to R. Gamaliel,
etc. Talm. in sanded. c. 11. fol. 90. 6. apud. Greg. Not. p. 128. I will
conclude this part with a remarkable saying of an Arabicke Commentator upon the
Turkish Alcoran; he that desires to escape Hell fire and go to Paradise, let
him believe in God, and the day of judgment, and do to every man as he would
be done by; What says the careless and debauched man to this? does he think to
be without those thoughts that all mankind has? if he thinks he shall be
possessed with them as men are, when dying, will it not be a torment to him
that he thought not of them sooner? and that he can only think of them then
when it is too late: I^ there greater torment in the World then for a man on
hi^ death bed to be racked wit^ the consideration of his eternal state, and to
reflect how often h^ was told it would come to that and that all men sooner or
lat^ have those thoughts; how poss^^ble, yea how easy it had been t^ prevent
them, how serious^ God and men warned them (...) them. Good God! that men w^^^
not embrace Religion, when the^ see they cannot avoid it; the men will not come
under the yoke of it, when all men do so, or else at last come under the
torments of it: what think you? will you stifle religious reflections then as
you do now, you cannot do it, because your fond imaginations and conceits,
your foolish hopes, all that ill grounded peace within, all your carnal mirths
and recreations, all your sensual delights and contentment which assisted in
the diverting of these thoughts will fail you, and you will be left alone to
dwell with your pain and conscience.

Sect. 3.
You see the wisest in all ages at their death, when they were freest from
design, owning that Religion which they did not consider as they ought in their
lives and they were too many, and too wise to be imposed upon; see the greatest
doing the like, though too great to be otherwise over^ awed or frighted.

1. Nimrod the founder of the Ass^^rian Monarchy, who from his do^minion
overbeasts whereof he wa^ a mighty Hunter, (...). Epith.
advan^ced the first to a govern^ment over men ( Abar^^nel in par. Noach;)
acknowledg^ed in his later days Gods power over him as great as his over h^^
subjects, wherefore he Institute the worship of the Sun and Sta^^ the greatest
instruments of Go^ government, (and many are ^^ opinion that the He^ thens

What you are born to do, do while you live; as who should say with Solomon,
whatever thine hand finds thee to do, do it with all thy might, for there

2. Ninus the next from Nimrod save Belus, the time, place, manner of whose
death is uncertain, Vid. 2. Eusebius. chron. and Scal. Isa. 9. see Gregory.
Assimon. 232. 23.
has this History (in Colophonius in Phoenix in Atheneus his twelfth Book)
viz. Ninus the great Emperor who never saw the Stars, nor desired it,
worshipped neither Sun, Moon, nor Stars, never spoke to his people, nor
reckoned them strong in eating and drinking, and skillful in mingling wines,
yet when dead left this testimony among all men, viz. Looking o^ this Tomb,
hear where Ninus is whether thou art an Assyrian, ^ Mede, or an Indian, I speak
to thee no frivolous or vain matters formerly I was Ninus, and lived a^ thou

I^ proudly possessed my self ^ failed, and when I went into the invisible
state, I had neith^^ Gold, nor Horse, nor Chario^ I that wore the rich Crown of
f^^ver, am now poor dust.

Nay, There is a tradition ^ mong the Jews, (in the bo^^ Maase Toral. quoted by
Muns^^^ upon Genesis) that Abraham being brought before Amraphel King of
Assyria, for burning his Father Terahs Idols, though but three years old,
discoursed before the Tyrant concerning the Creator of Heaven and Earth; Amra.
phel. quasi dixsit descend.
Am^aphel proudly replied, that it was he that made ^he Heaven and the ^ost of
Heaven; if so, said Abraham, ^ay thou to thy Sun, that he should ^^se in the
West, and set in the ^ast, and I will believe thee: Am^aphel being exasperated
with the ^hilds boldness and discretion, ^ommandeth that he should be ^ast into
the fire, out of which God ^elivering the child (whence the lord is said to
bring him from Vr^ ^ the Chaldees) convinced the ^an, so far as to make him
worship ^od in the fire.

Sardanapalus, that prodigy of ^^faeminacy, as wanton as Cicero observed his
name is, who (as Justin writes) did nothing like a man but that he Died as he
did; yet had a Tomb at Anchialus, which with Tarsus he built in one Day, upon
which he ordered this inscription (...) Eat, drink, Play^ etc. All is not worth
this; his Statue being drawn ^illiping the World.

Phul. in Herodotus his Euterp^ hearing that the Oracle should pronounce
against him that he should live but six years and dye the seventh, the King
hearing this, commanded that certain Lamps should be made for the Night time,
which he intended to spend in Jovialty whilst other ^lept, that so he might
delude the Oracle, and live twice the lon^ger by taking so much more no^tice of
his Day, but when he w^^ called to Dye, Oh said he if ^ had thought I had thus
dye^ I had not so lived.

3. Senacherib going forth with his Army against Egypt, Herodotus.
it came to pass one Night that a plague of mice came upon him and disarmed his
soldiers by devouring their harness of leather, in memory whereof there was
erected a statue like this Prince in stone, holding a mouse in his hand with
this inscription (...) etc. who ere beholds me let him learn to be religious.
How Nebuchadnezzar was taken down from the pride of a great King to the
despicable condition of a poor Beast till he ^ift up his eyes unto Heaven and
his understanding returned unto ^im, and he blessed the most high, and praised,
and honored him that lives for ever, whose dominion is an everlasting
dominion, and his Kingdom is from everlasting to everlasting, that is till he
acknowledged the most high to have ruled in the Kingdoms of men; is worthy all
men's most serious consideration, as it is set down in Dan. 4. compared with the
fragments of Berosus in Josephus 1. Affricanus, Eusebius, Scaliger, and Sedar
olam Rabba^ As is the sad instance of Belshazzar, the last Assyrian Monarch
being greatly troubled, his countenance changed in him, his Lord astonished, his
thoughts perplexed, so that the joints of his loins wen^ loosed, and his knees
smote on^ against another amidst the mos^ Joviall entertainments of his mos^
solemn Feastivals called (...) upon the Caldee decree upon the wall, as in
Athen.
Mean, Tekel, Perez God has numbered the Kingdom, and finished it thou art
weighed in the ballanc^ and found wanting; thy Kingdom is divided and given to
the M^^des and Persians. In the sam^ night was Belshazzar King of the Chaldeans
slain, Dan. 5. compared with Scaligers notes upon the Greek fragments.

4. Cyrus the Persian left this ^emento behind him to all mankind ( Plutarch:
Paral 703 ^edti. Par.) (...) etc. Whosoever thou art man, and whencesoever thou
come (for I know ^hou wilt come to the same condition that I am in) I am
Cyrus, ^ho brought the Empire to the ^ersian, do not I be^eech thee en^ie me
this little piece of ground which covers my Body.

5. Alexander the Founder of ^he Grecian Monarchy, though ^e allowed himself
all the exces^es that a man was capable of, upon an imagination that he was
God, yet after he had had expe^^ence of all things in the World, ^^d his Master
Aristotle had by his command studied the ground and bottom of all things in
Nature, Plutarch and Curtius both testify of him, Vid. Alex.
that in his latter days he called the Gymnosophists to resolve him whether
the dead or the living were most: How a man might become a God: How a man might
live s^^ as to dye well. And at last wa^ so possessed with the sense of
Re^ligion, as to lie under so much trouble and disturbance of Spi^rit, as to
look upon every little matter as portentous and ominou^ and to fill his Palace
with Sacri^ficers, Expiators, and Diviner^ (...) etc. So dreadf^^ a thing
(says Plutarch^ is unbeleif and contemp^ of the Gods, vid. Alex.
which sooner o^ later fills all men's minds (as (...) did Alexanders, who
thereby a^^knowledged one greater then hi^^self) with fears and terrors.

6. Julius Caesar conquered the Roman Empire, but not his own Conscience which
troubled him with dreams and terrified him with visions, putting him upon
Sacrificing, divining, and consulting all sorts of Priests and Augures, though
he found com^^^g from none, insomuch that a ^^^le before he died he was as
^^artless as the ominous Sacrifice (...) that he offered, professing to ^^s
friends, that since he had made (...) end of the Wars abroad, he ^^d no peace
at home, for having ^^spised as well all the Gods particularly in his
expedition ^^inst Iuba,) as all men, The Romans believed a providence; in that
Caesar's murderers fell upon those very weapons they killed him with.
although (...) Religious ^^^s were not (...) great as his ^^^the rer Bru^^^^
in whose (...) Caesar's blood cried so (...) that he could not sleep for the
noise he thought he h^ard at his doors, and an apparition he thought he saw in
his chamber, which told him it was his evil Genius, which he should see at
Philippi, where he no sooner saw it, than in the Career of his Victory he
drooped, and retired to fall upon his own sword, that he might not fall by the
Enemies; as in o^^ own Chronicles, the young chi^^dren of Edward the fourth,
who^ he is reported to have murthere^ troubled Richard the third ov^^ night
more then Henry the ^^venths Army did the next da^ for he started ever and anon
in h^^ sleep, Crying out take away the^^ Children from me. Religion c^^ torment
those whom it cannot ^^ claim.

7. It were worth our while (...) consider; why, so wise and gre^^ a Prince as
Philip of Macedon (...) one every morning to call upon him to remember that he
was a man; why he was so afraid to be charmed with the sweets of life, as to be
roused every day from sleep with the news of death; and why so puissant an
Emperor as Saladine would have these words proclaimed to his Army, and
communicated to posterity, viz. Great ^^ladine, Magnificent Conqueror (...)
As^a, and Monarch of the whole ^ast, carries away nothing with ^im to the
grave, for fruit of his ^ictories, but only a shirt which ^overeth the mould
of his body, and even this rag of linen too ^ortune gives him only to give
^he worms: Fui, and nihil amplius, ^ have been, and that is all.

To see the Emperor Adrian ^elebrating his own Funerals, and ^^rrying before
him his Coffin in ^riumph, when he lived; and ^hen he was a dying, to hear him
^y, animula, vagula, blandula, etc. Ah poor Soul, whither will thou go? is an
Argument to all sobe^ men, that though Riches, Honor, and Pleasures possess
the imagination, yet Religion dwells in ou^ ^^ason; those things staying with
us only, during the age of fancy and this lasting, during the tim^ of our
being; a consideration tha^ may bring all men of Gueva^^ mind, Who was both a
Courtier, and a Recluse.
that the m^^^ Courtly and ple^^sant lives are pu^^lick Pennances, a^^ that a
serious life is the only ple^^sure.

8. Nero having run up a^^ down to all the pleasures in t^^ world, to divert
and suppress a^^ thoughts of the deity, found impossible, the apprehensions
God, in the midst of Theaters, fea^^ and sports, stinging his heart; if (...)
slept on roses, or down, the de^^ men he had killed troubled hi^ he scosfed at
Religion, and feared: one while he despised sacred things, and at another time
they made him tremble with horror, in vain seeking all ways imaginable for
expiation, his Soul being torn with exquisite torments; wild as a stung beast
a great while, and at last sottish as a tame one, beseeching the Senate to have
so much ^ercy on him as to kill him, to ^ave him the labor and horror of doing
it himself; who had not a more tormenting thought than this, that he was an
Athiest, notwithstanding the warning given him by the burning of Diagoras, the
lice of Pherecides, the dogs of Lucian, the thunderstruck Olympius, and the
fearful death of others that led Atheistial lives; ( vid. Dion. Prusaeus Orat.)

9. Tiberius Caesar in Tacitus had his sins so turned into punishments, Ann 6.
that he thought nothing would confirm men more in virtue than to see wicked
men's breasts opened with their inward wounds and gashes, where their minds are
tormented with guilt, lust, and evil thoughts, as much as the body is vexed
with stripes; neither the greatness of his fortune, nor the pleasure of his
diversions and solitudes, being able to remove the punishment^ he carried about
him, insomuch that he does profess his anguish to the Senate in these words;
Qui^ vobis scribam patres cons^ripti, a^^ quomodo scribam, aut quid omnin^ non
scribam hoc tempore^ Suet Tiber. c. 61.
Dij deaeque pejus perdant^ quam quotidie me perire sentio. An^ Dion Cassius in
Tib. does profes^ to the world his acknowlegment o^ the (...), etc. The first,
and great God, that made an^ governs all things.

10. Otho having killed Galba could not kill his ghost, which though in vain,
by all ways of expiation attoned, gave his conscience as great a wound as he
had done his body; so that in his distress he came to that serious conclusion,
which Livy, l. 3. says all men come to in distress, prose quisque deos esse,
and non negligere humana fremunt, every man then believes a God; De van. idol.
whence that smart saying of Saint Cyprian [ haec est summa delicti] etc. this
is the highest, both folly and impiety, not to have those lawful sentiments of
a God, which a man cannot be without.

11. Neque enim post id Iugurtha, etc. neither had Iugurtha [writes Salust. of
him] after his many villainies a quiet day or night, nor could he trust any
place, time, or man, fearing both Friends and Foes, looking about, and pale, at
every noise, tumbling from one Room to another, several times in the night, in
a way unseemly for a Prince; and so mad with fears, as sometimes to get up in
his sleep in arms, disturbing the whole house: whence the Author concludes
that there is a God within men, who sees and hears all that they do: and I
may infer with Tertullian ex an^^ ^pol. 9. mae ipsius testimonio probamus deum
quae licet corporis car^ere pressa, etc. We may see and feel a God in our
Souls, which though kept close in the prison of the body, though depraved by
il^ principles, though weakened by lusts and concupiscence, though enslaved to
false gods; yet when it awakes and recovers, as out o^ a drunkenness, a sleep,
or sickness, it owns, fears, and appeale^ to a God, and repenting look^ up to
the heaven, from whence i^ came.

12. Julian the Apostate (o^ whom Crakanthorpe de provid. ^^ej has this
character, quo tetrius, magisque deo simul, and hominibus exosum animal orbis
vix vidit.) Yet gave this testimony toward the latter end of his life to
Religion in general (...), etc. We all by nature without any instruction have
engraven in us strong persuasions of a Divine being, to whom we must look up;
and I believe, says he, that our minds are to God, as our eyes are to light;
and at his death to Christian Religion, in particular when having two plots for
the honor of his Government, and Idols, the rooting out of the Galileans (so
he called the Christians) and the subduing of the Persians, he was prevented in
the former by being overthrown in the latter; and being shot or thrust in the
belly, he threw up his blood toward heaven, saying, ^icisti Galilee, thou have
overcome. O Galilean, meaning Christ Ita simul et victoriam fassus est, and
Blasphemiam evomuit (see Naz. or. 4. in Julian) Socrates Sezom: Theodoret in
Iul. collected in Pez. mellific. Histor p. 2. p. 273. Indeed St. Basil gave the
right reason why he and all other Apostates slight Religion, even because they
understand it not. (...), I read, I understood, I condemned, said Julian;
(...), thou have read but not understood; for if thou had understood, thou
had not condemned, said Basil.

13. Seneca, a man of great parts prudence and experience, after a serious
study of all the Philosophy then the World, Tacit. l. 13.
was almost a Christian in his severe reproofs of vice, and excellent
discourses of virtue, ( Lips^^s epist. ad Paul. Quintum.) and a Saint as Jerome
( de Script. eccles.) reckons him for his supposed Epistle to St Paul, Ab^^t
ut epis^. olas illas legitimas. put^tis. Lyl Greg. Cyr. de poel. hist. dial. l.
8. vid. Scrivel. Annot. in Martial 10.
and St. Paul's to him, to be read says Mr Gataker in his preloquium to
Antonius by those that study Divinity, as well as those that study other in
learning. And Came to this excellent temper by this consideration in hi^
reduced years (which is to be seen in his excellent preface to his natural
questions) O quam contemptares est homo, Miraris homines ad deos ^ire deus in
hominem venit. nulla fine deomens bona sen. ep. 73. p. 673.
nisi supra ^umana se erex erit, what a pitiful thing is man, were it not that
his Soul soared above these earthly things. Yea, and when he was somewhat
dubious as to the future condition of the Soul, yet he could tell his dear
Lucilius with what pleasure he could think of it: and at last that he was
settled in his opinion of an eternal state with this thought, and hoc habet
argumentum divinitatis suae, quod illam divina delectant, nec ut alienis
interest sed ut suis; the Soul had that mark of divinity in it, that it was
most pleased with divine speculations, and conver^ed with them as with matters
that did nearly concern it; and when it had on^e viewed the dimensions of the
Heavens contemnit domicilii prioris augustias, it was ashamed of the Cottage it
dwelt in; nay were it not for these contemplations, non fuerat operae pretium
nas^i, it had not been worth while for the Soul to have been in the body, and
as he goes on in detrahe ^o^ maestimabile bonum, non est vi^a tanti ut sudem
aut aestuem. Whence come such amazing fears, such dreadful apprehensions, such
sinking thoughts of their future condition, in minds that would fain ease
themselves by beleiving that death would put a period both to Soul and body?
whence on the other side comes such encouraging hopes, such confident
expectations, such comfortable prepossessions of their future state in the
souls of good men, when their bodies are nearest to the grave, An dubium est
habitare deum sub pectore nostro, an caelumque redire animas, coeloque venire.
And while the Soul is here in its cage it is continually fluttering up and
down, and delights to look out now at this part, and then at another, to take
a view by degrees of the whole universe, as Manilius, Seneca's contemporary,
expresses ^t, Quid mirum noscere mundum, ^i possunt homines quibus est and
mun^us in ips^s. To these notions of ^he future state it was, that Caesar owed
that his opinion of death, that it was better to dye once than to lose his life
in continual expectations: Being troubled with that unhappiness of men,
mentioned in Atheneus (...), etc. That he had done his work as if it had been
his play; and his play as if it had been his work.

14. Aug. Caesar consulting the Oracle about his successor, received thi^ answer
((...)) An Hebrew child has bid me leave these shrin, which Oracle Augustus
having received, erected an Altar with this inscription, Ara primogeniti dei,
the Altar of the first born of God: Holling p^ 35.
and when Tiberius by Pilates Letters, qui pr^^ conscientia Christanus himself
heard of the wonderful death of Christ (at which there was a voice hear^
saying, that the great God Pa^^ is dead, and at the eclipse it wa^ said, that
either nature was dead, or the God of Nature) and his more wonderful
resurrection he would have had him made a God. (See Phlegon. de temp. in orig.
cont. Celsum. l. 2. Fol. 21. Pliny l. 2. c. 25.

15. That Deity which Tiberius owned he feared, securing his head with Laurel
against the Thunderer; and running to his grave, as Ca^igula did afterward
under his ^ed, for fear of a God. That God which the great Scipio had at last
^uch a reverence for, that before ^e went about any business into ^he Senate he
went to prayers in^o the Capitol, looking for no good success from the
Counsels and endeavors of men, without ^he blessing of God, who he ^hought
made, and was sure ^overned the World; and indeed ^here was no man ever went
^eriously about any great matter but at last he was glad to take in the
assistance of a God, as Numa consult with Egeria, Zamolcus the Thracia^ with
AEgis, Lucurgus, Solon and Min^ with Jove, Mahomet with the Angel Gabriel, Gods
messenger, Ca^ligula with Castor and Pol^ux.

16. And as we have made ^ clear, that all men have near their latter end a
sense of Religion So Plutarch in his Book of Liv^ concludes most of his Hero^
Histories with discourse of Relig^^on, Vit. Romans ulj in p. 34. Ed. Par.
how divine does he treat ^ Immortality, an^ the happiness of a future stat^
(...), etc. when the body lies under pale death the Soul remains carrying upon
the image of eternity, for that is t^^ only thing that came from the God and
must return thither, not with, b^ without the body altogether pu^ and
spiritual, nothing followin^ it but virtues, which place it among the Heroes
and the Gods. How rationally does he discourse of the Divine Nature, and the
being of a God, toward the close of Pericles his life? how seriously does he
bring in Fabius Maximus that great commander in the emminent danger of the
Commonwealth, not training his men, but ^^rching in the Sybills books, and
^^lling his Contrymen that they ^ere overthrown, not by the ^eakness or
rashness of the Soldiers, but by their neglect and contempt of the Gods,
(...), beginning his great enterprise for the saving of ^is Country bravely,
with the ^ervice of the Gods; (...), ^s Plutarch goes on p. 176. not ^esigning
to ensnare men's minds with superstition, but to confirm their valor with
piety, and to ease their fears with the hope of Divine assistance, raising the
desponding peoples minds by Religion to better hopes, (...), because it was a
common principle amongst them, that the Gods gave success to virtue, and
prudence: upon which Fabius advised them, not to fear their enemies, but to
worship the Gods; and speakin^ of his successes, he has these words, (...),
But these you must ascribe t^ the goodness of the Gods: It wa^ the same man,
who when he wa^ asked what he should do with the Gods of Tarentum, answered
(...) Let us leave to the Tarentines the Gods that are angry with them.

How easily does the same A^^ther dispute of the influence Go^ has upon the
will of man by ve^^tue, and on the frame of nature b^ miracles and prodigies,
in Coriolanus, Camillus, and Dion: how gravely does he assert in Marius, that
the neglecting of the study of true wisdom will revenge it self, the despisers
of it [as he saith] not being able to do well in their greatest prosperity, and
the lovers of it not doing ill in their lowest adversities. How seriously does
Themistocles promise the Persian King ((...)) to honor the ^ing, and to
worship the God that ^reserveth all things. How de^outly does Camillus, p. 131.
ap^eal to the Gods as Judges of ^ight, and Wrong, Confessing after all his
great exploits, that ^e owed his greatness, not to his ^wn actions, but the
Gods favor, (...)] ^ho was upon all occasions pre^^t with him by many and
great ^^nifestations of himself, p. 132.
of which Plutarch has this grave discourse, To believe these manifestations
or disbelieve them is a matter of great uncertainty, some by too easy a Faith
falling to superstition, and vanity, others by too obstinate an unbelief into ^
neglect of the Gods, and loosnes^ (...), wa^^ness, and a mean are best. 132.
Ho^ resolvedly does Cato minor, wh^^ he would not yield to Caesar, 75^.
^^ whom the world submitte^ choosing rather that Caesar shou^^ envy his
death, than save h^^ life;) First read over Plato discourse of the Soul, which
w^^ found over his beds head, an^ then he dispatched himself wi^^ assurance of
enjoying what h^^ read: As Empedocles having p^^ ^^sed a discourse of the
etern^^ state of Souls, threw himself in^ AEtna, and Pliny into Ves^vius t^^
emblem^ if not the real s^at that state. And there was nothing made Artaxarxes
so afraid of death when the Assassines broke unto his Chamber, as the
uncertain^y of his state after he was dead, ^he reason why he wept when he
^ooked upon his vast Army to ^onsider that of 300000 men there ^ould not in
sixty years be two ^en in the land of the Living. ^he vanity, indeed and
shortness ^^ life was so much upon Augustus ^^sars spirit, that when he was
^^ying he spoke to his friends about him to clap their ^^nds, Suet.
intimating to them that ^^s life was only a short stage, and ^^ dying a going
off from it. Of ^is, Titus Vespasian, the delight of ^ankind, that dismissed
from him ^^ne sad, was so sensible, that if ^^ remembered at night that he ^^d
done no good that day, he should cry out Amici diem perdidi^ ^^ends, I have
lost a day. And that Prince was so sensible of a deity in the government of the
World, that when Crowns were sent him upon his conquest of Jerusalem, he
refused them, saying that he did it not himself, but God to show his wrath upon
the child^en of disobedience (if I man so translate Pezel. p. 35.) made u^ of
him as an instrument and the rod of his anger. And so serio^^ was he and Nerva
upon the thoughts, that Apollonius Thyan^us in Phylostratus says, neither ^
them was ever seen to smile ^ play. And Trajan entering upon his government
said, I enter into this palace in the same temp^ that I wish I were of when I
g^ out of it. These persons no dou^ finding the vanity of the Wor^ as^
feelingly as septimus Sever^ did, who left this testimony of ^^ life^ I have
been all things, and profits me nothing. And Alexander severus allowed
Christianity out of love to that one precept, do not that to another which thou
would not have done to thy self, a precept, upon consideration of the
excellency of it, he had engraven on his Plate, and Rooms, and proclaimed at
the punishment of all malefactors. And indeed Religion was so amiable in the
eyes of most of the greatest men ^n the World, that Charles the ^reat said of
it as another Em^erour had done before him, that ^e gloried more in being a Son
of ^he Church, then in being an Em^erour of Rome; and when an Affrican King
ready to be Bap^^zed in his house, saw twelve Christian beggars, and asked
those servants they were, was ^ld they were Christ's, thereupon ^^fused Baptism,
because the ser^ants of Christ were so poor, the Emperor replied, that if he
went to prayer three times a day as he did he would ^ind such inward
excellencies in Religion as would recompense all the outward inconveniences
that might attend it.

Dan. Heinsius, a Master (as Seld^n expresses it, tam severiorum quam
amoeniorum Literarum, History-professor at Leyden, Secretary and Bibliothecary
of the same University, and appointed Notary of the Synod of Dort, said at
last, Alas, as to humane Learning, I may use Solomon's expressions, That which
is crooked cannot be made strait.

Methinks (says Hensius, and Master Baxter out of him) I could bid the world
farewell, and immure my self among my Books, and look forth no more, (were it a
lawful course) but shut the doors upon me, and (as in the lap of Eternity)
among those Divine Souls employ my self with sweet content, and pity the rich
and great ones that know not this happiness. Sure then it is a high delight
indeed, which in the true lap of Eternity is enjoyed!

Cardinal Mazarine, having made Religion wholly subservient to the Secular
interest, amassed to his own interest and person all ^he Treasure and Intere^t
of Eu^ope, and managed the Crown of ^rance for several years together;
^iscoursed one day with a Sorbon Doctor concerning the immortali^y of the soul,
and a man's eternal ^state; and then wept, repeating that Emperors saying,
Animula ^agula blandula, quae abibis in lo^^? O my poor Soul, whither mil^ ^hou
go? Immediately calling for ^^s Confessor, and requiring him (...) deal freely
with him, and vow^^g ten hours of the day for Devotion, seven for Rest, four
for Repasts, and but three for business: saying one day to the Queen Mother,
Madam, your favors undid me: were I to live again, I would be a Capuchin
rather then a Courtier.

Cardinal Richlie^, after he had given law to all Europe many years together,
confessed to P. du Moulin, that being forced upon many irregularities in his
life^time by that which they call Reason of State, he could not tell how to
satisfy his Conscience for several things and therefore had many tempta^tions
to doubt and disbeleive (...) God, another World, and the immortality of the
soul; and b^ that distrust, to relieve his akin^ heart: But in vain; so strong
(h^ said) was the notion of God o^ his soul, so clear the impressio^ of him
upon the frame of the World, so unanimous the conse^^ of mankind, so powerful
the convictions of his conscience, that he could not but taste the power of the
world to come; and so live as one that must die, and so die as one that must
live for ever. And being asked one day why he was so sad: he answered,
Monsieur, Monsieur, the soul is a serious thing; it must be either sad here for
moment, or be sad for ever.

Sir Christopher Hatton, A little before his Death, advised his Relations to be
serious in the search after the will of God in the holy Word: For (said he) it
is deservedly accounted a piece of excellent Knowledge, to understand the Law
of the Land, and the Customs of a man's Country; how much more to know the
Statutes of Heaven, and the Laws of Eternity, those immutable and eternal Laws
of Justice and Righteousness! to know the will and pleasure of the Great
Monarch and Universal King of the World! I have seen an end of all Perfection;
bu^ thy Commandments, O God, are exceeding broad.

Whatever other Knowledge a man may be endued withal, could he by a vast and
imperious Mind^ and a Heart as large as the San^ upon the Sea-shoar, command
^l^ the Knowledge of Art and Nature^ of Words and Things; could h^ attain a
Mastery in all Languages and sound the depth of all Art and Sciences; could he
discours^ the Interest of all States, the Intrigues of all Courts, the Rea^son
of all Civil Laws and Constitu^tions, and give an Account of a^ Histories; and
yet not know t^^ Author of his Being, and the Pr^^server of his Life, his
Soveraig^ and his Judge; his surest Refug^ in trouble; his best Friend, (...)
worst Enemy; the Support of h^^ Life, and the Hope of his Death; his future
Happiness, and his Portion for ever; he does but sapienter descendere in
infernum, with a great deal of wisdom go down to Hell.

Francis Iunius, Hi^ ( speaking of a Country m^ns-house, into which he retired
by chance for food.) (O sapientiam dei admirabilem) ( says he) optimam scholam
Christianitatis dominus mihi paraverat, sic effecit deus admirabilite^ ut bonus
rustic^s sanctissimum ^^lum quem habebat operante domino mihi quasi
instillaret. Ego vero malus Christianus, si quidem Christianus ei scientia

a Gentile and an Ingenious Person, who has written his own Life, as he was
reading Tully de Legibus, fell into a persuasion nihil curare Deum, nec sui,
nec alieni; till in a Tumult in Lions, the the Lord wonderfully delivered him
from imminent death, so that he was compelled to acknowledge a Divine Providence
therein: And his Father hearing the dangerous ways that his Son was misled
into, sent for him home, where he carefully and holily instructed him, and
caused him to read over the New Testament; of which himself writ thus: Novum
Testamentumaperio, ex. hibet se mihi adspicienti primo augustissimum illud
caput, In principio erat Verbum, etc. When I opened the New Testament, I first
lighted upon John's first Chapter, In the beginning was the word, etc. (...)
read part of the Chapter, and wa^ suddenly convinced that the Divinity of the
Argument, and the Majesty and Authority of the Writing, did exceedingly exce^
all the Eloquence of Human^ Writings: My Body trembled, m^ Mind was astonished,
and was s^ affected all that day, that I kne^ not where and what I was. The
wast mindful of me, O my God, a^^cording to the multitude of t^^ Mercies; and
calledst home thy lost Sheep into thy Fold. And as Justin Martyr of old, so he
of late professed, that the power of godliness in a plain simple Christian
wrought so upon him, that he could not but take up a strict and a serious Life.

The Earl of Leicester, in Queen Elizabeth's days, though allowing himself in
some things very inconsistent with Religion, came at ^ast to this Resolution;
that Man differed not from Beasts so much ^n Reason, as in Religion: and that
Religion was the highest Reason; nothing being more Rational, than ^or the
supreme Truth to be be^ieved, the highest good to be em^raced, the first Cause
and Almighty Maker of all things to be ^wned and feared; and for those who were
made by God, and live ^holly upon him, to improve al for ^im, and live wholly
to him: Agree^ble to the Apostle, give up your Souls and Bodies unto him, whieh
is your reasonable Service.

Galeacius Caracciolus, Marques^ of Vico, a Noble Personage of ^ great estate,
powerful Relations^ both in the Emperours^ See his life writ first in Italian,

notwithstanding the great Overtures of his Master, Pathetick lette^ of his
Uncle, bitte^ Cries and Tears of hi^ Parents, his Wife and Children the loss
both of his Honor and Estate, forsook his Country and all that was dear to
him, t^ come to Geneva, and embrace^ reproached, despised and perse^cuted
truth, with Moses, to who^ he is compared, choosing ^ather ^ suffer afflicti^n
with the people (...) God, than to enjoy the pleasur^ of sin for a s^as^n;
esteeming the reproach of Christ, greater riches than the treasures of the
world, because he had a respect to the recompense of reward, And endured as
seeing him who is invisibe: where he used to say, Valdeso, the Author of a good
book of considrations is an instance o^ the same nature, leaving the Emperors
service, for the stricter profession of Religion; ^he particulars I have not
now by me
that he would not look upon himself as worthy to see the Face of God, if he
prefered not one hours communion with Christ, before all the riches, and
pleasures of the world. -- (Says a great man speaking of this Marquess) Non
celandum est hominem primaria familia natum, honor and opibus florentem,
nobilissima and castissima ^uxore, numerosa prole, domestica quiet and
concordia totoque vitae statu beatum, ultro ut in Christi Castra migraret
patria cessisse: ^ditionem fertilem, and am^nam lautum patrimonium, commoda^
non minus, quam voluptuosam habitationem neglexisse splendorem domesticum,
patre, conjuge, liberis, cognatis ex affinibus sese privasse, etc.

Galen, (who should have been mentioned before) in his excellent book de usu
partium, which Gassendus supposes he writ with a kind of enthusiasm upon him (
adeo totum opus videtur conscriptum (...),) and so that [to use the words of a
learned man] all those seventeen books of his upon that subject, are a kind of
119^ Psalm in Philosophy, or a perpetual Hymn upon the praise of the great
Creator, a just commentary upon those words of the Psalmist^ Psalm. 139. 14. I
am fearfully, an^ wonderfully made: mavelous ar^ thy works, and that my Soul
knows right well.

I say, Galen observing the beautiful and useful contexture o^ man's body, which
Lactantius calls Commentum Mirabile, could not choose but break out into the
praise of him that made it, handling this argument for the Divine providence
and wisdom, Lact. de opis. dej^ ex ipsis membrorum officiis and ufibus partium
singularum quanta^vi providentiae quisque factus sit intelligere nobis licet.
See Arist. de partibus Animal.
in ordering the several parts of animals, and adapting them to their several
uses against Epicurus then, with as much zeal and exactness as any Christian
can do now against Atheists; So that, that whole book contains in it a most
full and pregnant Demonstration of a deity, which every man carries about him,
in the ^rame of his body, on which ac^ount men need not go out of themselves
to find proof of a deity, ^hether they consider their minds ^r their bodies,
those Domesticos ^stes, of which all men that have ^^nsidered them, have said
as Heraclitus said in another case, etiam hu dii sunt.

This instance makes good a^ learned man's observation, that however men may for
a time offer violence to their reason, and conscience, subduing their
understanding to their wills and appetites; yet when these facultie^ get but a
little Liberty to examine themselves, or view the world; or are alarumed with
Thunder, Earth^quake, or violent sickness, the^ feel a sense of a deity brough^
back upon them, with greate^ force and power than before the^ shook it off
with. These and some other considerations of this natu^^ wrought upon Funcius
the learne^ Chronologer, that reflecting upon his deserting the calling of a
D^^vine to advance to the honor (...) a Privi-counsellor, he left the warning
to posterity.

Disce mei exemplo mandato m^ nere fungi, and fuge ceu pestem (...), which you
may understand by the admonition, Iustus Jonas, Son of a Divine of that name,
bequeathed next year to all that came after him: Quid juvat inn^meros scire
atque evolvere casus, si facienda fugis, si fugienda facis.

9. Sir Philip Sidney (a Subject indeed of England, but they say chosen King of
Poland, whom the Queen of England called her Philip, the Prince of Orange his
Master, whose friendship the Lord Brooks was so proud of, that he would have it
to be part of his Epitaph, here lies Sir Philip Sid^eys friend; whose death
was la^ented in verse by the then ^ings of France, and Scotland, and ^he two
Universities of England, ^epented so much at his death, of that innocent vanity
of his life, his ^rcadia, that to prevent the unlawful kindling of heats in
others, he would have committed it to the flames himself; and left this farewell
among his friends, Love my memory, cherish my friends, their faith to me may
assure you that they are honest, Se my Lord Brooks his Book.

10. The late famous Frenc^ Philosopher, De Carts (who should have been
thought on sooner) though no Atheist, because s^ zealously asserting the
existenc^ of God, and the immortality o^ the Soul, yet because he is much in
vogue with men Atheistical disposed, as if his Hypothe^^^ ascribing so much to
the power o^ matter, served theirs that thin^ there is nothing left to do for
the providence of a God; and as he thought he could clear up the account of the
worlds beginning without a God; is a great evidence of the power of Religion,
when after his long De prin^ip. p. 2. art. 54. 55. Nay Doctor ^^rvy having

discourse of the power and notion of matter, this great improver, and
discoverer of the Mechanical power of matter does ingeniously confess the
necessity, not only of Gods giving motion in order to the Orgine of ^he
universe but of his conserving motion in it, for the uphold^ng of it: considero
Materiam (they are his own words in his ^nswer to the third letter of H. M. p.
104) Sibi libere permissam, and nullum aliunde impulsum susci^ientem, ut plane
quiescentem, illa autem impellitur a deo, tantunde^ motus sive translationis in
ea co^^servante quantuw ab initio posui^^ And therefore its no wonder tha^ it
is reported of one of the greates^ unbelievers now among us; tha^ he trembles
at the thought o^ death, because though in an h^^mour, he speaks strangely
(...) God, yet in his study, a^^ thoughts, he cannot but tremb^^ before him;
and whatever his pe^^vishness has spoken of the ete^^^ Spirit, his Philosophy
owns, a^^ fears him, without whom he m^^ wrangle, but he cannot sleep; ye^^ he
that talks so peremptory ^ of the great God in public^ looks not so in
private: The^ may be some Atheists in comp^pany, but there is none alone;
a^certainly he would not be so ^ fraid in the night to put out t^^ light on the
beds head, but that confesses it impossible to ext^^guish the candle of the
Lord in his bosom, for we may say of those that are commonly called Athiests,
as Plato [ de rep. l. 9.] does of Ty^ants [(...)] etc. If any ^erson could but
see ^hroughly into their Souls, Vid. (...) Hom. Virg. Sen. Luc. Statis.
he should find them all their lives ^ull of fear, grief and torments; ^ectus

And I do not wonder at it since ^trabo reckons this among the ^pophthegms of
the Indians (...), there are judgments in ^he invisible state, and that the

Gauls, and the Britains were in C^esars time so confident, that he says, [1
de bell. Gal.] that the reason why they fought so obstinately was because they
were taught by the Druids not to fea^ death, because they knew it wa^ but
passage to a better life, the Soul in their opinion not perishing^ but passing
from one to another ^ which Lucan has expressed in hi^ ranting way, thus

Gregentius Archbishop of T^^phra, in the Kingdom of the Ho^^rites, in the
Empire of AEthiopi^ many hundred years ago, up^ the request of the Godly King
that place, undertook a Disputa^^^on with the Jews about the truth of Christian
Religion, (the dispu^ation is at large Printed out of an ^ncient M. S. procured
by Abbat Noall, his Christian Majesty's Envoy to Constantinople, and the East:
in the first volume of the Bibliotheca patrum, p. 194. pub^ished at Paris,
1624.)

Lent being over, and the Jews ^omming to give an account of themselves before
the King, and ^ll the Nobility of the Kingdom. ^oly Gregentius the Archbishop
^ndertook for the Christians, and ^erbanus a learned man in the ^ewish Laws and
Prophets under^ook for the Jews in a solemn ^isputation before the most ^^lemn
assembly in the world, ^^veral days until Herbanus be^^^g astonished to hear
so many pla^^s of the Law and Prophets al^^dged for Christ, was so ingeni^s as
to confess, that since Mos^s came from God, the Jews should hear him; and since
Christ came from God the Christians should hear him, and to offer, that if
Christ were come already as he believed he was to come in Person, and end the
controversy with mankind an offer which all the Jews asse^^ted to, with a loud
voice to God^ the King and the Archbishop say^ing, show us Christ, and we wi^^
believe in him, whereupon the Archbishop leaving the assembl^ went aside to
pray, and as the King and the assembly said Ame^ to the close of his prayers,
there w^ an Earthquake about them; an^ in the East, the heaven opene with a
great brightness abo^^ them, from whence the Lo^^ Jesus appears in glory before
them: and after each side wa^ little recovered of its Ecstasies, t^ the one of
joy, the other of fe^ bespeaks them thus, with a Io^ voice upon the prayer of
the Archbishop and the Faithful; I ^ppear before your eyes, who was ^^^cifyed
by your Fathers; at which voice the astonished Jews ^ere struck blind, and upon
en^^uiry, finding that the Christians ^ere not so, Herbanus being led ^the
Archbishop, desired that he ^ould pray Christ to open their ^^es, as he had
shut them, and ^^ey would believe when they (...) that he could do good as well
^evil; adding that if he did (...), he should answer it in the (...) of
Judgment.

The Archbishop answered, that ^^on condition they would be ^^ptized, they
should receive ^^eir sight: what if we should Baptized and continue blind (...)
Herbanus; let one of you be ^^ptized, answered the Arch^^^hop; they consented,
and the man no sooner had his head sprinkled, but he had his eyes opened, and
cried out (...), Christ is true God, and I believe in him, whereupon all the
rest were Christened, to the number of 505000. men^ Moses appearing likewise to

as most certain and i^^fallible Truth to P^^sterity.

That Leontius Apiamens^ a most faithful and Religious man that lived many
years at Cyrene, assured them that Synesius (who of a Philosopher became a
Bishop) found at Cyrene one Evagrius a Philosopher, who had been his old
acquaintance, fellow-student, and intimate friend, but ^n obstinate Heathen,
with whom ^ynesius was earnest, but in vain, to become a Christian, following
with arguments for Christian Reli^ion so close, that the Heathen, though he
persisted a great while ^n discourses to this purpose; that to him it seemed
but a mere fable and deceit, that the Christian Religion teaches men, that
this world shall have an end, and that all men shall rise again in these
bodies, and their flesh be made immortal, and incorruptible, and that they
shall so live for ever, and shall receive the reward of all that they have done
in the body; and that he that has pity on the poor, lends to the Lord, and
he that gives to the poor and needy shall have treasure in Heaven, and shall
receive an hundred fold from Christ, together with eternal life.

Yet being convinced by Synesi^^ his close arguments, that they were certain
truths he and his famil^ was Baptized, and not long afte^ brought Synesius
three hundre^ pounds in Gold, to be distribute among the poor, upon condition
he would give him a bill under h^^ hand that Christ should repay hi^ in another
world, which he did not long after, Evagrius being ne^ death, ordered his Sons
^^ his burial to put Synesius his b^ in his hand; they did so, and t^^ third
day after, the Philosoph^ seemed to appear to Synesius the night, and say unto
him [co^^ to my Sepulcher where I lie, and take thy bill, for I have received
the debt, and am satisfied: which for thy assurance I have written with my own
hand] whereat the Bishop informed his Sons what he had seen, when he knew not
what they had done, who going with him to the grave, found this bill ^n the
dead man's hand, thus sub^cribed [ Ego Evagrius Philosophus etc. i. e. I
Evagrius the Philoso^her, to the most holy Lord Bishop ^ynesius greeting: I
have received ^he debt which in this paper is written with thy hand, I am
satis^yed, and have no action against thee or the gold which I gave thee, and
by thee to Christ our Saviour] ^hey that saw the thing admired, ^^d glorified
God that gave such ^onderful evidences of his pro^ises to his servants: and
says ^^ontius, this bill subscribed thus (...) Philosopher is kept at Cyrene
most carefully in the Church to this day, to be seen of as many as desire it,
though (to use Master Baxters words, who recites this very passage before his
book of Crucifying the world) we have a sure word of promise sufficient for us
to build our hopes on; yet I thought not it wholly improfitable, to cite this
one History^ from so credible Antiquity, that the Works of God may be had i^
remembrance.

King Charles the first had that sense of Reli^gion upon his Spirit, Whose
(...) argues him so possessed with a serious Religion, that he there hazards
all for (...) squares his interest by it, raises all his Prin^^^ples of
Government upon it, advises his S^^ to be serious in it, comfort himself
under ^ the Calamities that befell him and his Peop^^ with considerations taken
from it, framed (...) Soul into the power of it, at last sealed it as (...)
first King that dyed a Martyr for it.
(...) that the one act of passing the (...) for the Earl of Strafford's death
and the other to the prejudice of the Churches of England and Scotland,
troubled him as long as he lived, and brought him not only to vow as he did
before the most Reverend Father in God G. Lord Archbishop of Canterbur^, to do
Penance for them; but also to a resolution never to allow the least thing,
though it was but the little Assemblies Catechism, against his conscience. And
when it was ^old him his death was resolved ^on, he said, I have done what I
^ould to save my life, without losing ^y Soul, and sinning against my
^onscience. Gods will be done.

Sir Walter Rawleigh, See the excellent preface to his History of the ^orld,
wherein he does from great instances of ^^e Providence of God, finding out the
sins of ^^e greatest men, Kings of France, Spain and Eng^^nd, conclude what
fear and reverence of God should be upon the hearts of all men.
^t the meeting usually ^eld with the Virtuosi in the Tower, discoursing of
Happiness, urged, that it was not only a freedom from Diseases and pains of the
body, but from anxiety and vexation of Spirit; not only ^o enjoy the pleasures
of Sense, but peace of Conscience, and inward tranquillity; to be so, not for
(...) little while, but as long as may be and, if it be possible, for ever^ And
this happiness, so suitable f^^ the immortality of our Souls, an^ the eternal
state we must live i^ is only to be met with in Reli^gion.

Master Howard, afterward the Learned Earl of Northampton, b^^ing troubled
with Atheistical sug^gestions, put them all off this wa^ viz. If I could give
any accou^^ how my self, or any thing else, h^ a being without God; how the^
came so uniform and so constan^ cansent of mankind, of all ag^^ tempers and
educations, (otherwi^^ differing so much in their apprehensions) about the
being of God, the immortality of the Soul, and Religion; in which they could
not likely either deceive so many, or being so many, could not be deceived; I
could be an Atheist. And when it was urged that Religion was a State policy to
keep men in awe; ^he replied, that he would believe ^t, but that the greatest
Politici^^s have sooner or later felt the ^ower of Religion in the grievous
ashes of their consciences, and dreadfulness of their apprehension about that
state wherein they must live for ever.

Bishop Usher, that most learned and knowing Prelate, after his in^efatigable
pains as a Christian, a^ ^cholar, a Prelate, and a Preacher^ ^^ent out of the
World with this ^rayer, Lord, forgive me my sins ^f Omission; and desired to
die as Master Perkins did, imploring the Mercy and Favor of God.

Sir John Mason, Privy Councellor to King Henry the eighth, and King Edward the
sixth, whom some make Secretary of State, setting him a little too high; others
Master of the Requests^ placing him as much too low, upon his deathbed called
for hi^ Clerk and Steward, and delivered himself to them to this purpose: ^
have seen five Princes, and bee^ Privy-Councellor to four; I have seen the most
remarkable ob^servables in foreign parts, an^ been present at most
State-tran^^actions for thirty years together and I have learned this after
(...) many years experience, that Se^^ousness is the greatest Wisdom Temperance
the best Physic, ^ good Conscience is the best (...) state; and were I to live
again, would change the Court for Cloister, my Privy Cousellers bustles for an
Hermits retirement, and the whole life I lived in the Palace, for one hours
enjoyment of God in the Chapel: all things else forsake me, besides my God, my
duty, and my prayer.

Sir Henry Wotton, after his many years study, with great proficiency and
applause at the University; his near relation to the great favorite Robert Earl
of Essex, his ^ntimacy with the Duke of Tus^any, and James the sixth King of
Scotland, his Embassies to Holland, Germany, and Venice; desired to re^ire,
with this Motto, Tandem didi^it animas sapientiores fieri quiescendo; being
very ambitious of of the Provostship of Eaton, that ^e might there enjoy his
beloved Study and devotion, saying often, that the day he put his Surplice on,
was the happiest day of his ^ife: That being the utmost happiness a man could
attain to (he said) to be at leisure to be, and to do good; never reflecting on
his former years, but with tears he would say, How much time have I to repent
of! and how little to do i^ in!

Having held a private conference awhile with his brothers Ambassador, he took
the candle to light him down, which the Ambas^ador endeavoring to hinder by
taking the candle into his own hand the Emperor refused, saying, Sir Remember
that you saw Charles the fifth, who has been attended by (...) many Armies,
and waited on by so many Lord and Gentlemen, Now has not a Servant at ha^^ in
his Chamber to wait upon him.
Charles the fifth, Emperor of Germany, King of Spain, and Lord of the
Netherlands, after three and twenty pitched Fields, six Triumphs, four Kingdom^
won, and eight Principalities added to hi^ Dominions, fourtee^ Wars managed,
resigned all these, retired to his Devotion in a Mo^nastery, had his ow^
Funeral celebrated be^fore his face; and left this testimony of Christian
Religion, That the sincere profession of it had in it sweets and joys that
Courts were strangers to.

Sir Francis Walsingham, toward the latter end of his life grew very
melancholy, and writ to the Lord Chancellor Burleigh to this purpose: We have
lived enough to our Country, to our Fortunes, and to our Sovereign: it is high
time we began to live to our selves, and to our God. In the multitude of
affairs that passed through our hands, there must be some miscarriages, for
which a whole Kingdom cannot make our peace.

Whereupon some Court-humo^i^ts being sent to divert Sir Fran^is, Ah, said he,
while we laugh, all things are serious round about us: God is serious, when he
preserves ^s, and has patience toward us; Christ is serious, when he di^th
for us; the holy Ghost is serious, when he striveth with us; the holy Scripture
is serious, when it is read before us; Sacraments are serious, when they are
administerd to us; the whole Creation is serious, in serving God and us: they
are serious in hell and heaven; and shall a man who has one foot in his grav^
jest and laugh?

Don Lewis de Haro, after he had lived a great while the grand Favorite and
States man of Spain, but with too little regard of Religion, growing
melancholy, was taken up by a Wit of Spain for being Priest-ridden, and
troubling his head with those notions of the immortality of the Soul, and the
state of the other world; he answered him with Tertullian'^ words, Quaedam and
Natura not^ sunt, ut mortalitas animoe pene^ plures, ut Deus noster penes
omnes^ Vtar ergo and sententia Platoni^ alicujus pronunciantis, Omnis anima est

Philip the third of Spain lying on his death bed the last of March. 1621. Sent
thrice at midnight for Florentius his Confessor and Court-preacher, who with
the Provincial of Castile discoursed to ^im of approaching death, ex^orting him
to submit to Gods ^ill so gravely that Majesty its self could not choose but
weep^ and after some intermission from his tears, Pezel. Mellit. His^or. 1283.
Anno 1621. Synch. Hispan.
and thanks for his wholesome Admonition, the King spoke to him, thus, do you
not remember that in your Sermon on Ash Wednesday, you said that one of your
Auditors might dye that Lent that touches me, and lo now my Fatal hour is at
hand; but shall I obtain eternal felicity? at which words great grief and
trouble of mind seizing the poor Prince, he said to the Confessor, you have not
hit upon the right way of healing, is there no other remedy; which words when
the Confessor understood of his body, the King subjoyne^ Ah! Ah! I am not
sollicitious o^ my body, and my temporary disease, but of my Soul; and the
Confessor sadly answered, I have done what I could, I must commit the rest to
Gods providence.

Upon this occasion Florentius discourses at large of Gods mercy, remembering
his Majesty what he had done for the honor and worship of that God: to which
the King replied, Ah, how happy were I, had I spent these twenty three years
that I held my Kingdom in a retirement; and the Confessor rejoyned, that it
would be very acceptable to God, if he would lay his Kingdom, his Majesty, his
Life, and his Salvation at the feet of his crucified Savior Jesus Christ, and
submit himself ^o his will: willingly, willingly, said the heart-sick King,
will I do ^his, and from this moment, do I ^ay all that God gave me, my
Do^inions, Power and my Life at ^he feet of Jesus Christ my Savi^ur, who was
crucified for me, those image he then kissed with ^ingular affection, sayi^g,
moreover to Florentius (and it was some of the last words he spoke) now really
you have suggested to me very great comfort.

Count G^ndamar, was as great a Wit and Statesman as ever Europe knew, and
took as much liberty in point of Religion; till declining in years, he would
say, as they say of Anselm, I fear nothing in the World more then Sin: often
professing, that if he saw corporally the horror of sin on the one hand, and
the Pains of Hell on the other, and must necessarily be plunged into the one,
he would choose Hell rather than Sin; yea^ That what liberty soever he ha^
taken, he had rather be torn in pieces by wild Horses, than wittingly and
willingly commit an^ Sin.

Should we now turn over the Lives of the Fathers, and the Saints in all ages,
we shall find that they had so much comfort from Religion since they professed
it, [for he that believes has the witness in himself] that they can join with
Saint Polycarp. who when persuaded to swear by the ^ortune of Caesar, and
blaspheme or renounce his Savior, said, Fourscore and six years have I served
Christ; I have found him (...) good master, neither has he ever offended me in
any thing: I have lived by him, I will live to him.

Salm^sius, that excellent French Scholar, whom the Learned men of his time
never mention without such expressions as these, Vir nunquam sat is laudatus,
nec temere sine laud nominandus, Gu^. Riv. Pref. ad Vindic. Evang. ^otius
Reipub. Literariae decus, went out of this World with these words in his mouth,
Oh I have lost a world of Time! Time, that most precious thing in the World,
whereof had I but one year longer, it should be spent in David's Psalms, and
Paul's Epistles: Oh Sirs! (said he to those about him) mind the World less, and
God more; all the Learning in the World without Piety, and the true fear of
God, is nothing ^^rth: The Fear of the Lord, that is ^^sdom; and to depart from
evil, that is Understanding.

Innocence of Iean Vrick, who was a devout poor man, that spent ^ight hours of

Necessaries: and ^his complaint to another that ad^^red his astonishing
industry; This great man coming over as I take it from Sweden, or returning
thither, after he had been Ambassador ^or that Crown in France, where his wife
by his direction joined in Communion with the English Church, lay by his own
distem^er, and the violence of a storm he met with in his passage on his death
bed, where sending for ^he Minister of the Place, I think he desired him to
perform the last office for him, Professing himself the poor Publican, and
saying he had nothing to trust to but the mercy of God in Christ, and wishing
that all the World saw as much reason for Religion as he did. See his life in
the Dutch Eicones, Illustrum virorum, the Athenae, Batavica Elogia, Doctor
Hamonds defenses of Gro^ius and the particular manner of his death, in Doctor
Merick Casaubons little tract, the verborum usu: see Gro^us his Epist.

The Earl of Strafford, He charged his Heir upon his blessing to have nothing
to do with the Patrimony of the Church.
O trust not i^ man that shall die, nor in the Son of man that shall be made a^

is the blood of Christ, and the testimony of a good Conscience.

Sir Spencer Compton, Brother to ^he Right Honorable the Earl of Northampton,
calling to him such Reverend persons as Bishop Mor^ey, and Doctor Earls, when
he was on his deathbed at Bruges, he ^aised himself upon his pillow, and held
out his arms as if he were to embrace one, saying, O my jesus! Intimating the
comforts that then flowed in from the holy jesus into his Soul. After which
^oly ecstasie, composing himself ^o a calm and serious discourse, ^e said to

Religion; for that ^ill bring peace at the l^st.

An Excellent person havi^^ writ exquisitely for Christian R^^ligion, has this
discourse of t^^ Nature of it, viz. Does now the conquest of Passions,
forgiving (...) Injuries, doing Good, Self-deni^^ Humility, Patience under
cross which are the real expressions (...) Piety, speak nothing more No^^ and
Generous then a luxurio^^ malicious, proud, and impati^^ Spirit? Is there
nothing more b^^ coming and agreeable to the So^ of man in exemplary Piety, and
a holy well-ordered conversation, then in the lightness and vanity (not to ^ay
rudeness and debau^hery) of those whom the World accounts the greatest
Gallants? Is there nothing more graceful and pleasing in the sweetness,
^^andour, and ingenuity of a truly Christian temper and disposition, ^hen in
the revengeful, implacable Spirit of such, whose Honor lives and is fed by the
blood of their ^nemies? Is it not more truly ho^ourable and glorious, to serve
that God who commands the World, then to be a slave to those ^assions and
Lusts which put men upon contiuual hard service, and ^orment them for it when
they ^ave done it? Were there nothing else to commend Religion ^o the minds of
men, besides that ^ranquillity and calmness of Spirit, that serene and
peaceable temper which follows a good Conscience, wheresoever it dwells, it
were enough to make men welcome that guest which brings such good entertainment
with it. Whereas the amazements, horrors and anxieties of mind, which at one
time or other haunt such who prostitute their Consciences to a violation of the
Laws of God, an^ the Rules of rectified Reason, man be enough to persuade any
rational person, that Impiety is the greatest folly, and Irreligion mad^ness.

Sir Thomas Smith, after he ha^ many years served Queen Eliz^beth as Secretary
of State, an^ done many good services to the Kingdom, particularly to the
se^ling of the Corn-rate for the U^^^versities, dis^harged all affairs a^
attendants a quarter of a year b^^fore he dyed, sent to his singul^ good
Friends, the Bishops of Wi^chester and Worc. entreating them to draw him out of

toward the ^^tter end of his life, that a little smattering ^^ Philosophy
would ^^ad a man to Atheism, ^^t a through insight ^^to it will lead a man ^^ck
again to a first ^^use; and that the first ^^inciple of right rea^^n, is
Religion; in reference to which, it was the wisest way to live strictly and
severely: for i^ the opinion of another world be not true, yet the ^weet^st
life in this world is Piety, Virtue and Honesty; If it be, there are none so
miserable as the loose, the carnal and profane Persons, who lived a
dishonorable and a bas^ life in this world, and were lik^ to fall to a most
woeful state in the next.

Prince H^nry used to s^y that he knew no sport worth an oath, and with Judge

Master Seldon, who had comprehended all the learning and knowledge that is
either among the Jews, Heathens; nor Christians; and suspected by many of too
little a regard to Religion: one after^noon before he dye^ sent for Bishop
Usher and Doctor Langbar^^ and discoursed to the^ to this purpose: T^^^ he had
surveyed mo^^ part of the Learn^^^ that was among the (...) of Men; that he
(...) his Study full o^ Boo^ and Papers of most subjects in (...) World; yet
that at that time ^ could not recollect any passa^^ o^^ of those infinite Books
a^^ Manuscripts he was Master wherein he could rest his So^^ save of the holy
Scriptures; wherein the most remarkable passage that lay most upon his Spirit,
was Tit. 2. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. For the Grace of God that brings salvation,
has appeared to all men; teaching us, that de^^ing ungodliness and worldly
lust, ^e should live soberly, and righte^^sly and godly, in this present ^orld;
looking for that blessed ^^pe, and glorious appearing of the ^reat God, and our
Savior Jesus christ; who gave himself for us, ^^at he might redeem us from all
^^iquity, and purify unto himself ^peculiar People, zealous of good ^orks:
these things speak, and ^xhort and rebuke with all Autho^^ty.

Sir Thomas Coventry, once hear^^g some Gallants jesting with ^eligion, said,
that there was no ^reater argument of a foolish and ^^considerate person, than
profanely to droll at Religion. It Is a sign he has no regard of himself, and
that he is not touched with a sense of his own interest, who plays with life
and death, and makes nothing of his Soul. To examine severely, and debate
seriously the principles of Religion, is a thing worthy of a wise man:
whoso^^ver turn^ Religion into Railler^^ and abuses it with two or three ^old
jests, renders not Religion but himself ridiculous, in the opinion of all
considerate men, because he sports with his o^^ ^^fe, for a good man says, If
the principles of Religion were doubtful, yet they concern us (...) nearly,
that we ought to be serious in the examination o^ them.

I shall never forget a tradition of the Jews related by Masi^^ upon Joshua,
viz. that Noah i^ ^he universal deluge, instead o^ Gold, Silver, and all sorts
of treasure carried the bones of Adam into the Ark, and distributing them among
his Sons, said, take ^hildren, behold the most pre^ious inheritance your Father
^an leave you; you shall share ^ands and Seas of God shall ap^oint, but suffer
not your selves to ^e entangled in these Vanities, my ^hildren all glideth away
here ^elow, and there is nothing which ^ernally subsisteth; learn this ^esson
from these dumb Doctors, ^he relics of your Grandfather, which will serve you
for a refuge ^n your adversities, a bridle in ^our prosperity, and a Mirror at
^ll times; provide for your Souls. ^he opinion of whose immortali^y you will
find got every where, ^here you sind men, so true is that ^f Plotinus, that
never was there a man of understanding that strove not for the immortality of
the Soul, Animam inde venire unde rerum omnium authorem parentem, spiritum
ducimus. Quint. That which we call death being in Max. Tyrius, but the
beginning of immortality: Therefore Philostratus mentions a young man much
troubled about the state of Souls in the other life, to whom Apollonius
appeared, assuring him [(...)] that it was immortal, and bidding him not be
troubled at it, since it was the Divine providence it should be so: Nay,
Phlegon a Heathen has written of a Maid in Trayls of Phrygia, Philenion by
Name, who burned both with lust and a feavour to death, appeared to her Father
and Mother, to tell them if they took not that course of life the gods designed
men for, and which they are to blame they did not instruct her in, they would
find another state they little thought of where there was grief, and no
re^medy: and he adds moreover that he sent this history, whereof he was an
eye witness, by a particular messenger to the Emperor Adrian.

Curopalates relates how the excellent Painter Methodius, drawing the last day
heaven black, the Earth on fire, the Sea in blood, the Throne of God environed
with Angels in the clouds, wrought upon Bogoris the Barbarous King of Bulgaria,
so as that in a short ^ime he yielded himself to God by a happy conversion, for
he dreaming on the whole proceedings of that day, among other things saw the
sins he had made so light of, bespeaking him thus: I am the pleasure thou have
obeyed, I am the ambition whose slave thou wast, I am the avarice which was the
aim of all thy actions; behold so many sins, which are thy children, thou
begatst them, thou ^ovedst them so much as to prefer them before thy Savior.

These con^iderations made weeping Heraclitus wipe his eyes, and look
cheerfully, saying, that his eyes were never dry till he had settled his
thoughts about his eternal state, and had a dry Soul, not steeped in lust,
capable of the notions of immortality, the only support of Bellisarius, when
having been the Thunderbolt of War, made the East, West and South to tremble,
the mighty Powers of the Earth crawling in dust before him; he that drew the
whole world in throngs after him was forsaken, and walked through the streets
of Constantinople with two or three servants, as a man that had outlived his
Funerals, to serve as a spectacle of pity, at last loosing his eyes, and crying
in the Streets dateabolum Bellisario.

This example, and others, of the sad uncertainty of humane affairs, and the
necessity of yielding to religious thoughts, sooner or later, made Charlemain
at the Coronation of his Son, utter these serious words; My dear Son, it is to
day that I die in the Empires of the world, and that Heaven makes me born again
in your person, if you will reign happy, fear God, who is the force of Empires,
and Sovereign Father of all Dominions, keep his commandments, and cause them
to be observed with unviolable fidelity, serve first of all for an example to
all the world, and lead before God and man a life irreproachable.

What Steph. Gardener said of justification by Faith, a branch of our Religion,
is true of all of it, viz. that though it be not looked upon as a good
breakfast for men to live up to in the heat of their youth, yet is it a good
supper for men to live upon in their reduced years. The Persian messenger in
AEschiles the Tragedian, could not but observe the worth of Piety, in time of
extremity: when the Grecian Forces hotly pursued us [said he] and we must
venture over the great wat^r Strymon, frozen then, but beginning to thaw, when
a hundred to one we had all dyed for it, with mine eyes I saw many of those
Gallants, whom I heard before so boldly maintain there was no God, every one
upon their knees, with eyes and hands lifted up, begging hard for help and
mercy, and entreating that the Ice might hold till they got over. Those
Gallants [saith a good man in the application of this story] who now proscribe
godliness out of their hearts and houses [as if it were only an humor taken up
by some precise person] and Galba like, scorn at them who fe^r and think of
death, when they themselves come to enter the lists with the King of terrors,
and perceive in earnest, that away they must into another world, and be saved
or tormented in flames for ever, as they have walked after the flesh, or after
the spirit, here without question they will say as dying Theophilus did of
devout Arsenius, thou art blessed O Arsenius, Who had always this hour
before thine eyes; or as the young Gallant, that visited St. Ambrose lying on
his death bed, and said to his comrade, O that I might live with thee, and dye
with Saint Ambrose: And it is observed among the Papists, that many Cardinals,
and other great ^nes, who would think their ^owle, and Religious habit ill
^^came them in their health, yet ^^e very ambitious to dye, and be ^uried in
them, as commonly they ^re. They who live wickedly and loosly, yet like a
Religious habit very well, when they go into another world.

Cardinal Woolsey, one of the greatest Ministers of State that ever was, who
gave Law for many years to England, and for some to all Europe, poured forth
his Soul in those sad words [a sufficient argument that Politicians know
nothing of that Secret whispered up and down, that Religion is a mere
Court-cheat, an arcanum imperij, a secret of Government] had I been as diligent
to serve my God, as I have been to please my King, he would not have forsaken
me now in my gray hairs.

Its an observation common and useful, that as there is no man of quality
hardly goes out of the world now, without the instructi^on, prayers, and
ministry of a Chap^lain; however they have lived i^ it owning the comforts of
Religion^ though they disowned the practice of it. So there is no King or
Statesman, from the beginning of our history to H. 8. times, that left not
legacies more or less to pray for his Soul, though it might be said of some of
them, as the tart Historian says, they never prayed heartily for it
themselves; those Masses that they laughed at, ^hen living, they craved and
^ayed dearly for, when dying.

A^postacy, and split in pieces, as i^ were by so grievous a bruise, fainted
fearfully, failed him quite, and fell a sunder in his breast like drop^ of
water, hear some ruful expressions of his desperate state from his own mouth. O
that I were gone from hence, that some body would let out this weary Soul! I
tell you ^here was never such a monster as I am; never was man alive, a
spectacle of such exceeding misery; I now feel Gods heavy wrath, that burns
like the torments of Hell within me, and afflicts my Soul with pains
unutterable.Verily desperation ^s hell it self, -- the gnawing ^orms of
unquenchable fire, hor^our, confusion, and which is worst ^f all, desperation
it self continu^lly tortureth me. And now I ^ount my present state worse than
(...) my soul separated from my ^ody, were with Judas; the truth (...) never
had mortal man such ex^erience of Gods anger, and ^^tred against him; as I
have, the ^amned in hell, I think endure not ^^e like misery; If I could
conceive but the least spark of hope in my heart of a better state hereafter I
would not refuse to endure the most heavy wrath of the great God, ye^, for
2000. years, so that at length I might get out of misery. -- O that God would
let loose his hand from me, and that it were with me now as in times past; I
would scorn the threats of the most cruel Tyrants, bear torments with most
invincible resolution, and glory in the outward profession of Christ, till I
were choked with the flame, and my body turned into ashes.

Gribaldus adds in the forecited letter, that being sound in his mind, and
memory; he would in sober-sadness, wish that he we^^ either in Cain ^ or Judas
his cas^ the worm had so eaten into hi^ conscience, and the fire into hi^ Soul.

4. Long before this (though remembered it not till now) viz. about the year
1160. diverse of ^he best of the City of Lions, ^alking and walking in a
certain ^lace after their old accustomed ^anner, especially in the summer ^^e,
conferred together upon ^atters; among whom it chanced ^e (the rest looking on)
to fall ^own by sudden death, Waldus ^^e Father of the Waldenses, a ^^^h man of
that City, being one ^^ them, and beholding the matter ^^re earnestly than the
other, and ^^^^ified with so heavy an exam^^e, Gods holy Spirit working
^^^hall, was stricken with a deep ^^d inward repentance, where^^on followed a
new alteration ^^^h a careful study to reform his ^^^mer life; he admonished
others ^o to repent, and ministered large ^^es of his goods to such as ^^ded;
many people therefore ^^ly resorting to him, and he seeing them ready and
diligent to learn, he began to give out to them certain rudiments of the
Scripture, which he translated himself into the French tongue.

5. And fourscore years before this [ viz.] about the year 1060. there was at
Paris a Funeral of a grave Doctor, at the interring of whom, when the Priest
came to the then used form Responde mihi^ or, answer me, the Corpse sat
up^right in the Beer, and to the a^mazement of all that were there cried out
justo dei judicio accusat^^^ sum^ at the just Tribunal of Go^ I am accused,
lying immediatel^ down in its first posture; the asto^nished company deferring
the B^^rial to see the issue of this stran^^ accident, till next day, a vast
mu^^titude gather together from a^ parts of the City, to consumma^^ these
strangly interrupted obs^ quie^, when at the same words the disturbed body
rises again, and with the like hideous noise, cried out Iusto dei judicio
judicatus sum, by the just judgment of God I am judged; whereupon the
solemnity was deferred a day longer, when the whole City thronging to the
strange Burial, in the presence of them all, at the reciting of the same words,
he rose up the third time, and cried Iusto dei judicio ^ondemnatus sum, by the
just judgment of God I am condem^ed; whereat, as the whole mul^itude was sadly
affrighted, so ^runo was seriously affected, insomuch that being then an
eminent ^octor in the same University, he ^^lled his Scholars together, and
^^ld them that as they had for^erly heard, so they now saw that ^he judgments
of the Lord are ^^searchable, and his ways past ^^^ding out; for said he, this
Person whom we honored, for the strictness of his life, the virtues and
discretion of his converse, cries now that he is damned by the jus^ judgment
of God. Just are al^wayes the judgments of God though sometime hidden (I a^
says the poor man damned b^ the just judgment of God)^ dreadful speech, which
I would to God always sounded in o^^ ears, till it get into our heart^ that
since we cannot by an^ means avoid judgment, a^^ the wrath to come, we may
wi^^ fear prepare for it, and in t^^ our day seek the things that b^^long to
our peace: Let us co^^sider my Brethren (goes (...) good man on) I beseech you
w^^^ profit has this poor wretch^ (...) Hell, of all his Light and kno^^ledge,
now he is for ever in da^^^ness? what advantage of all (...) estate, when he
has not a (...) of water to cool his tongue^ What of honors and delights, now
he must undergo as many torments, as formerly he enjoyed pleasures? we have
seen his body thrown without honor into a dunghill; and we may imagine his
Soul to be thrown without mercy into Hell, to suffer with the damned, the
gnawing of the worm that shall never dye, and the scorching flame, that shall
be extinguished, where there is burning unimaginable, a stink intolerable, and
grief interminable, where men may seek death, and shall not find it; death
being there immortal, and feeding on the miserable, not that they might have
the great mercy of dying, but suffer the extreme punishment of living. What
shall we do? Whose advise shall we ^etake our selves to? For all we ^ike sheep
have gone astray, every one has turned to his own way; There is none that does
good, no not one; we have all sinned, and done amiss, we are all the children
of wrath, and deserving the same condemnation unless the mercy of Christ
deliver us. What shall we do, shall we not all likewise perish? I^ God spared
not this man, nor the Angels that sinned, nor the natu^ral branches that were
cut off how shall he spare us? and ye^ do we think that his hand (...)
shortened, that it cannot save? (...) that he will shut up his lovin^ kindness
in displeasure? Wh^^ shall we do? Oh my brethren (...) so entangled, so
difficult, and (...) w^ighty a matter, Let us not (...) in our own strength,
let us (...) Counsel, not of the Jews, (...) trust to be justified in the La^^
nor of the Philosophers, who ^^^ly o^ their own virtues, no^ (...) the wi^emen
of this world, i^ (...) savor not the things of God, but of those that fear
the Lord, and walk in his ways: Let us ^ear the great propitiation for ^^ur
sins, the Lord Jesus, who says (as the forerunner John Baptist, than whom
there was not greater born of a woman, did before him (repent ye, for the
Kingdom of heaven is at hand:) bring forth fruit worthy of re^entance: if ye
repent not, ye shall all likewise Perish. Let us ^ear Saint Peter p^eaching
ear^estly that men should repent, that there sins may be blotted ^ut; and when
his hearers were ^ricked at the heart, and asked that they should do to be
saved, ^e repeats that exhortation, re^ent. Repentance brethren (so ^runo goes
on) is the only ^lank left us, after shipwreck; (...) us turn to ^^e Lord, and
he will have mercy upon us; for he des^reth not the death of a sin^e^ but that
he may return from (...) sin and live; neither le^ ^^s de^^^^^ for he that
pro^i^eth pa^^^^^ upon repentance, promi^eth (...) so much time as we promise
o^^ selves to repent; there are tho^^sands^ whose ca^e is like theirs (...) the
proverbs, to whom God speak^^^^ I have called, and ye would (...) answer, I
have stretched ^o^^ my hands, and ye have refuse^^ Ye have despised all my co^^
se^s, and set a^ naugh^^ all (...) reproves. I will also laugh (...) yo^^
Calamity, and moc^ ^^ll your fear comes, when your (...) as desolation, and
you^ des^^^ on comes a^ a whi^le wil^^ when distress and anguish ^^^meth upon
you, then shall (...) call, but I will not answer^ (...) shall seek me early,
and shall (...) find me. The Lo^d now call^^ us, for this voice is not for
(...) ^^ke that is dead, and past repen^^^nce, but ours who live, and whom the
patience and long-^^ffering of God leads to repen^^^nce] Let us not delay from
^ay to day to answer him, for we ^now not at what hour the Lord ^ay come.

At these words one of the ^cholars Landvinus by Name, a ^^scan of Luca, in the
Name of (...) rest, declared they were all ^^^vinced of the truth of what (...)
said, Dr. M. D. E.
but added with^^, that the whole world ^eth in wickedness, and it was al^ost
impossible to be seriously Re^^gious amidst so many strifes and ^^tentions, so
many tumults and ^mmotions, so much malice and ^^vy, so much fraud and
in^^stice, so much lying, blasphe^^^g and swearing, so much ^^^ptation and
vanity, so much ^emperance and debaucheries. A good man must separate himself
to intermedle with tru^ wisdom, take the wings of a Dov^^ and fly and be at
rest, and with ^^noch and Noah walk with God and therefore said he, Brethren^

choosing rather to serve at Gods Altar, than to seek the honor of State
employments: to testify his independency upon all others, and to quicken his
diligence in Christ's service, he used in his ordinary speech, when he made
mention of the blessed Name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, to add my
Master: next God he loved that which God has magnified above all things, his

do) that he would not part with one leaf thereof for the whole world, if it

The Pearl, Math. 13.
I Know the ways of learning, both the head
And Pipes that feed the press, and make it run,
What Reason has from Nature borrowed,
Or of it is self like a good hous^wife spun.
In Laws and Policy, what the Stars Conspire,
What willing Nature speaks, what forced by fire,
Both the old discoveries, and the new found Seas,
The Stock and Surplus, Cause, and History;
All these stand open, or I have the Keys.
Yet I love thee.
I know the ways of Honor, what Maintains
The quick returns of Courtesy, and Wit,
Invies of favors, whether party gains,
When glory swells the heart, and wounds it.
To all expressions, both of Hand and Eye,
Which on the World a true Loves knot may tie;
And bear the bundle, whereso'ere it goes,
How many drams of Spirit there must be
To sell my Life unto my friends, and foes.
Yet I love thee.
I know the ways of pleasure, the sweet streams,
The Lullings, and the Rellishes of it,
The propositions of hot blood and brain,
What mirth, and music means, what love and wit.
Have done these twenty hundred years and more,
I know the projects of unbridled store.
My stuff is flesh, not brass, my senses live,
And grumble often, that they have more in me,
Than he that curbes them, being but one to free.
Yet I love thee.
I know all these, and have them in my hand,
Therefore not sealed, but with open Eyes,
I ^lie to thee, and fully understand,
Both the main sale, and the commodities,
And at what rate and price I have thy love,
With all the Circumstances that may move.
Yet through the Labirinth, not my grovling wit,
But thy silk twist, let down from heaven to me,
Did both conduct, and teach me, how by it
To Climb to thee.
We will conclude with Master Herberts Motto, with which he used to conclude
all things that might seem to make any thing for his own honor.

Less than the least of Gods mercies. And his saying was, when he heard any of
his own good works mentioned; Ah it is a good work if it be washed in the blood
of Christ.

Reader,
When you have read thus far, I must entreat you to do as I did when I had
writ so, and that is to consider, (the reason why Religion so excellent in its
self, and so exquisitely set forth in the discourses of learned men in all
ages, has so little influence on the minds, and manners of men, is because men
do not think as well as read; do not by Meditation, let^ those great things
sink into the heart, to warm the affections into holy Resolutions, which float
in the brain to perplex the head with ineffectual notions. Inconsideration
undoeth the world, consideration must recover it) consider all these serious
sayings, spoken not an random, but upon experience, and that not of any small
time (for here every man speaks upon the experience of his whole Life at the
close of it) and these speeches not of anyone party or sect, or of any one age,
but of all men, of all persuasions, and of all times; spoken when they were so
disintere^^ed and disingaged from the world, as neither to be deceived or
abused by any, the most fair, and promising; nor to deceive, upon any the most
profitable and gainful consideration in the world; I say, take time to reflect
seriously on all these warnings of dying men (and they, many of them, the
greatest, the most learned, and wisest in the world) and add to them many
more, that in the lives, and deaths of worthy men, you have met with in your
^eading, but especially remember the last words of all your Friend^ and
acquaintance, about whose beds you have stood in a dying hour, when the
Physician taking his leave of them, entreated them to send for the Divine, to
whom with sad hearts and weeping eyes they confessed the folly of their former
courses, begging his comfort and his prayers; and when the good man examining
them about their repentance, told them that they should try the sincerity of
their contrition for what was past, by the resolutions they had to live well if
it pleased God to give them any longer time, or if it were possible to live
over their lives again, the pall and sick men answered, ah, if we had an
hundred lives we would live them at another rate than we have done: Remember
when the good discourse on both sides was over, how the children, friends or
relations came about the bed, to take their last farewell, and how the dying
person hardly now able to speak, yet gathered all their Spirits to leave with
their posterity, their blessing, with these serious words, Serve and fear God;
and if the Companions of their now repented sins came to them, recollect how
sadly they warned them against their former courses, beseeching them as they
loved them, to take example by them: and speech failing them at last, how their
hands and eyes were fixed upon that heaven and God which we think not of.
Remember and consider that i^ is but a little while, and you must be in the
same condition, and entertain the same thoughts, for you are as sure to dye as
they did, as you ^ive as they wish they had not; and show your selves men in a
manly and rational resol^^ion ^o live in no other course than that you dare dye
in: to lead betimes that life, which you see all men wish they had led: Let
none of those temptations have power to beguile you to the Commission of those
evils, which will have no relish in the evil day, when they should comfort you
under the guilt of them. Remem^er the end, other men's which you have seen, and
your own which you expect, and you will not do amiss. The Lord Capel of blessed
memory told his Son R. H. the Earl of Essex, upon the day of his Death, that he
would leave him a Legacy out of David's Psalms, Lord, lead me into a plain path:
For Boy (said he) I would have you a plain honest man, to which I may add that
excellent saying of the same Noble Lord, the 276th of his choice daily
observations, Divine and Moral, viz. The wisdom of those young men is most
excellent, who by providence and discourse of reason, do so order their
affairs, that they ^tay not till necessity or experience force them to use that
o^der, which wise foresight would much sooner have taken.

I will close these living sayings of dying men, And in the preface to h^^ Book
^alled Knowledge and ^^^^tise.
with the remarkable expressions of a Reverend Person^ Consideration of our
ways is a matter of so exceeding great use, that scarce any thing undoeth
mankind more than the neglect of it. O that I might prevai^ with you to a
conscientious practice of it. I have heard of ^ Gentleman that upon his Death
bed, laid this one comman^ upon this wild Son, and engaged him to the
performance of it by a solemn promise; that he should every day of his life, be
half an hour alone; which this young man constantly observing, and spending his
half-hours retirement (at first) in any kind of vain thoughts; at last he began
to ponder with himself, why his Father should enjoin him this penance; and the
spirit of God suggesting to him, that his intent therein could be no other, but
to bring him to consider of his ways, and whether they tended, and what would
become of him hereafter, if he went on: it pleased the Lord so to set those
thoughts home upon his heart, that he became a new man. Which one instance may
teach us how advantageous a duty, serious consideration is, and how much it
does concern men to retire frequently from the Cares, and ^usinesses of this
Life, and examine how the case stands between God, and their Souls.

FINIS.
