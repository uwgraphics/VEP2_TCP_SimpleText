To my much Honored Friend, Mr. Robert Coleman, a true Lover of MUSIC.
SIR:
AS Music sits Queen Regent in the Center of Arts, whereby she preserves an
Harmonious Sympathy amongst them; so her studious Care, to continue that Unity,
has qualified her servants in several degrees; some like Seraphins, sing
Hosanna in the highest; others like Angels, charoll the Nativity of Emanuel.
The Ayry Quire in their kind, warble Praises to their Creator, and Man in
various Tunes, sets forth the Glory of his Maker: I could speak of the
Spherique Harmony, and the general Music of the Creature, both sensitive and
vegetative, whose tacit Voices glorify the Lord of their beings. But your
better Knowledge (Worthy Sir) needs no illustration of her Excellencies from
me, you having so long been Rector Chori. Knowing therefore not only your
perfection in this Art, but your Zeal to defend it; I have presumed to present
you with some of her Servants Endeavors, not snatched up at random, nor caught
at with an uncivil and rude hand, but gathered with a reverend and careful
collection, to avoid offense and scandal. And if that General Good I aim at
therein shall acce^d my wishes, (being the Mutual Society of Friends in a
Modest Recreation) I have caught the happiness of my Desires; so being
enricht by That, and your courteous patronizing of These, You and I Will sing.

tu-o da Glo-ri-am. Non no-bis, etc.

Yours, John Hilton.

In Praise of MUSIC.
(...)! Miraculous Rhethorick! that speak sense
(...) a Tongue! Excellent Eloquence!
(...) thee, in wild Beasts have been known,
(...) have liked thy Notes above their own:
How easy might thy Errors be excused,
Were thou as much beloved, as thou art abused?
Yet although dull souls, thy Harmony disprove,
Mine, shall be fixed, in what the Angels love.
W. D.
To all Lovers of Music.
I Hold it needless to boast the Approbations that have been formerly given by
Great Persons, both to testify and augment, the Life and Honor of this
liberal Science, the earthly solace of man's soul; and in particular, to
delights of this Nature, such as you shall find in this small Volumne, which I
dare style Musical, and in themselves sweet and harmonious, and full of
harmless Recreation, and to all that love and understand Music, the true
sense and value of them will so appear; of which I boast not, further then you
shall please to judge. As for the Rounds, they have, and may shift for
themselves; so might the Catches too (...) these Times, when Catches and
Catchers were never so much in request; all kind of Catches are abroad; Catch
that Catch may, Catch that Catch can, Catch upon Catch, (...) Caych it, and
mine Catch it; And these Catches also, which I have now published by
importunity of Friends, to be free for all men's catching; only my wishes are,
that they who are true Catchers indeed, may catch them for their delight; and
may they that desire to learn, catch them for their Instruction: But let those
that catch at them with detraction (as that is a catching disease) catch only
the fruits of their own Envy. I am (...), they that cannot make better, cannot
injure these, which your favorable Acceptance may make good to him that is
your Friend,

JOHN HILTON.

Ad Lectorem.
CAtches are Catches, be they better or worse,
And these may prove hopeful if not spoiled at Nurse:
It Is therefore desired if any do halt,
That the Judicious may set right the Fault,
In time by this means, they may walk without Crutches,
And merrily please you for your Charge, which not much is.
