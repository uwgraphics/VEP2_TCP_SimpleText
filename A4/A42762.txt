THE HUMBLE REPRESENTATION OF THE COMMISSION OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY
To the Honorable Estates of Parliament, upon their Declaration lately
communicate to us.

Edinburgh, 28 Aprile 1648.

Seeing your Lordships have been pleased in your Answer to us of the twenty of
this Month to remit us to your Declaration to the Kingdom, for satisfaction
to our eight desires formerly presented to your Lordships, as likewise to our
other desire concerning applications to be made to the King as well as to the
Parliament of England; And seeing your Lordships in the same Paper answering
our desire to be satisfied in the whole matter, were pleased again to remit us
to the Declaration, as containing the grounds and resolutions of the Parliament
on the whole matter. We have therefore taken to our serious consideration your
Lordships Declaration, to look after satisfactorie answers to these our
desires, and to be satisfied on the whole matter: But instead thereof, our
fears and dissatisfactions are not a little increased by your Lordships
Declaration. We shall not search into some particulars in matter of fact,
mentioned in the narrative part, neither shall we be curious after the reason,
why in so large a Declaration concerning publict dangers, duties, and remedies,
There is no expression for preservation of Monarchical, Government in his
Majesty's Posterity as well as in his own Person.

To the Preface we shall only say this much, that we could have wished your
Lordships had been pleased to express your selves more plainly, who are those
obstructers and traducers of your Lordships proceedings: those deceivers and
abusers of the people, which your Lordships (we suppose) point at in reference
to this Kingdom, the Declaration being intended for the Subjects of this
Kingdom, whom your Lordships call the abused People; If your Lordships meaning
be, that the People are abused by the lies and calumnies of Malignants, how
comes it that so much favor and forbearance is granted to such men? if any
others then the Malignant party in the Kingdom be meant, we should be glade
they were made known.

In the first part of the narrative, concerning the necessity occasion and
consequence of the conjunction of both Kingdoms, We cannot but take notice of
that which your Lordships say of those common enemies, by whose counsels and
practices the composing of differences in the beginning was hindered, and what
evils this Kingdom might have expected, if these counsels and advices which
gave first life and motion to these dissentions, should have been still
prevalent, We desire it may not be forgotten who were these common enemies, and
whose counsel it was that did prevail about his Majesty in the beginning of
these troubles, and whether there ought not to be a jealous and watchful eye
over any such, if even after their joining in the Covenant they be found in a
way of compliance with known Malignants, and in a way of opposition to such as
have been most active and zealous in the Cause from the beginning.

Your Lordships add, that in pursuance of the Covenant this Kingdom joined in
Arms with their Brethren of England, and did prosecute these ends till their
common enemies were subdued, and most of them brought to such condign
punishment, as the respective Parliaments thought fit. We shall here pass your
Lordships omitting of the Treaty between the Kingdoms, which may be thought to
have had a near and immediate influence in reference to the conjunction of
these Kingdoms in Arms, although the Covenant was the chief foundation
thereof: But whereas your Lordships seem to intimate that the cloud of
Malignancie was then sufficiently dissipat, or at least that the Covenant was
sufficiently performed in bringing Delinquents to such condign punishment as
the respective Parliaments thought fit; We are sorry that we have cause to
remember what sorbearance, yea, favor and friendship has been granted to many
such: and we are so far from thinking the danger from these former common
enemies past and gone, that we still see Malignancie upon the one hand, as
Sectarisine upon the other springing up like roots of bitterness to trouble,
yea, to desile many in these Kingdoms. these are the horns which yet push
Judah and Jerusalem on both sides, the Lord prepare such carpenters as may cut
off both the one and the other.

As for the breaches of Covenant which your Lordships insist upon in the
following part of your narrative, we wish your Lordships to remember a passage
in the Declaration of the General Assembly, and how cautiously they speak of
the breach of Covenant in England* the words are these, We would not be
understood as if we meant either to justify this Nation, or to charge such a
sin upon all in that Nation; We know the Covenant has been in diverse
particulars broken by many in both Kingdoms, (The Lord pardon it and accept a
sacrifice) and we do not doubt but there are many seven thousands in England
who have not only kept themselves unspotted and retained their integrity in
that bussinesse, etc. That the Covenant has been foully and shamefully broken
by as many of the prevalent party of Sectaries and their adherents, as ever
took the Covenant; is clear and undeniable, and by their means has come the
resisting and hindering of Reformation, connivance at Heresy and Schism, and
other things contrary to the Covenant; But it can as little be doubted of, that
there are dangerous breaches of Covenant by Malignants, both at home and
abroad; And your Lordships know, true zeal against breach of Covenant should
strike equally on both hands, beginning to reform at home. Your Lordships say
well, that the not takers of the Covenant are by the joint Declaration of both
Kingdoms declared to be publict enemies to Religion and Country, and are to
be punished as professed Adversaries and Malignants: but we wish your Lordships
may not forget to apply that passage of the said Declaration to those who have
not to this day taken the Covenant in England, and that therefore, they may be
looks upon by your Lordships as common enemies which ought to be suppressed and
punished.

The laying aside of the Covenant out of the new Propositions sent to his
Majesty to the Isle of Wight we utterly disapprove, and are heartily sorry for
it: but we wish there had not been some guiltiness of this same kind at home,
when it was carried in the Committee of Estates, that there should be no
mention of the Covenant in the public desires sent up in August last to his
Majesty. And whereas your Lordships do enumerate amongst these breaches of
Covenant that they who ought to be brought to try all and condign punishment
for hindering the Reformation of Religion, dividing the King from his People,
or one of the Kingdoms from another, or making any faction or party among the
People, contrary to the League and Covenant, have been protected and assisted;
We shall here only desire your Lordships to remember, that all this is true of
Malignants, as well as of Sectaries: and for our part, (whatsoever liberty
there be in the manner or circumstances) we do not doubt, but the thing itself
is necessary, both by the Word of God, and Solemn Covenant, viz. That justice
be done and condign punishments inflicted on all hinderers of Reformation and
Peace, and all who make factions contrary to the Covenant, whether they be
Sectaries or Malignants: But if it was sufficient that the most part of the
Malignants were brought to such condign punishment, as the respective
Parliaments thought fit, which your Lordships gave us a touch of in the
precedent part of your narrative, we leave it to your Lordships consideration,
whether you do not hereby furnish such a retortion to those that favor the
Sectaries in England, as that they may plead from that principle in your
Lordships Declaration, that the punishment of Sectaries is to be referred
simply to the Parliament of England as they think fit, and that your Lordships
must allow them the same latitude of favor toward the Sectaries, as before you
have allowed both to your selves and them toward the Malignants. Your
Lordships add as another breach of Covenant, that instead of a firm Union and
Peace between the Kingdoms, a breach has been endeavored, which can not be
denied to be a breach of Covenant, and therefore a rock to be the more
carefully avoided; It is our grief that there is also cause to complain of the
Malignant party at home, as no less guilty of endeavoring a breach between
the Kingdoms.

The attemps, injuries, and violences of that party of Sectaries against his
Majesty's Royal Person, and the hard condition he is reduced unto by their
means, we are very sensible of: And, as we have often before professed, our
prayers and endeavors according to our place and calling, have not been
neither shall be wanting for the preservation of his Majesty's Person and
Authority, in the preservation of the true Religion, and liberties of the
Kingdoms: And we leave it to be pondered by your Lordships, whether they that
obstruct and hinder the requiring of satisfaction and security from his
Majesty, in point of Religion, before his restitution to the exercise of his
Royal Power, do not upon the matter, and by consequence obstruct and hinder
his Majesty's deliverance and restitution, whereof such security and assurance
had from his Majesty, might be a powerful and effectual means.

As we know not whom your Lordships mean when you speak of such, as had warrant
from the Parliament of this Kingdom, for access to his Majesty, and yet were
debarred, and as no violence nor injury offered to a public Minister of
another Kingdom can be excused, so we are informed, that the soldiers Act in
removing once the Earl of Lauderdale from Wooburn, was not only disclamed, but
his Lordship often thereafter permitted free access to his Majesty.

Your Lordships insist upon three instances of the breach of Treaties, one of
the large Treaty, and two other breaches of the Treaty, 1643. As to the first,
(which for orders sake we begin at) We cannot say that it holds forth any
convincing clearnes to us; Yea so far as we understand, the thing whereunto the
Kingdom of England was bound by the Treaty, was not insisted upon by the
Commissioners of this Kingdom at London, but ane alternative, for assistance
against the Rebels by Forces or Moneys; After which the Parliament of this
Kingdom made a desire of assistance by Moneys, which the Parliament of England
promised to take into their consideration; And seeing your Lordships in this
same Declaration wave breaches of Treaty in Money-matters, even where the Money
was due by Treaty, We hope your Lordships will find it the more inexpedient to
insist upon the not obtaining of that assistance by Moneys against the rebels,
being a way not provided by the Treaty.

Concerning the other two breaches which pitch upon the Treaty, 1643. First,
your Lordships say, that according to the first article of that Treaty, the
Covenant should have been taken by both Kingdoms, but that now by the
prevalent party of Sectaries and their adherents, it is not only laid aside in
the new Propositions, and no execution of public Orders for taking it
throughout the Country, but many in places of trust have never taken it,
neither are urged to take it. Certainly such slighting of the Covenant is a
great sin against GOD, and a high contempt of the Covenant; And it is very fit
that this Kingdom should desire the Parliament of England to press it, not
only upon persons of trust, but universally on all the Subjects of that
Kingdom: yet we are not convinced of any just ground of War against that
Kingdom, in that which has been instanced by your Lordships, especially
considering that the Covenant was taken by the Representatives, and other chief
corporations in England, whereupon both the General Assembly, and the
Parliament of this Kingdom have frequently mentioned in their Acts, Letters,
and Declarations, the Union and conjunction of both Kingdoms by Solemn
Covenant: neither are we without hopes, if things be carried on in a fair and
right way that the Kingdom of England may be brought a further length in the
performance of this duty; Whereof we are the more confident, because of the
famous and frequent testimonies given to the Covenant, and against the errors
of the time, by the Ministry in diverse Provinces in England. As for the last
breach, which your Lordships conceive to be against the eighth Article of the
same Treaty, 1643. We heartily wish, that the joint way of applications to the
King by both Kingdoms once begun, had been continued, and do conceive very
much prejudice to the Cause by the divided way: only we offer it to your
Lordships further consideration, whither this breach be not at least
disputable, there being no mention at all in that Article of Proposals,
Propositions, or Bills, but only of Cessation, Pacification and agreement for
Peace; So that it may justly be doubted whether the sending of those Proposalls
and Bills to the King without the consent of this Kingdom, has in it that
certainty and clearness of a breach of Treaty between the Kingdoms, as may be
a ground of War: And if it be a breach of the Treaty for either Kingdom singly
and dividedly to send Propositions to his Majesty. We shall crave leave that
we may desire to be informed, how this consists with that latitude which your
Lordships leave afterward in this same Declaration in the manner of presenting
Bills or Acts of Parliament to the King, for your Lordships desire assurance of
his Majesty to agree to such Acts or Bills as shall be presented to him by his
Parliaments of both or either Kingdoms, respective. We might also insist upon
some Papers and Propositions presented to his Majesty from this Kingdom at
Newcastle, and much more upon the Pacification concluded there, with his
Majesty, in reference to the disbanding and removing of the Rebels in this
Kingdom, and that in a single way (as we conceive) without the knowledge, and
concurrance of the Parliament of England.

But we shall come to that which your Lordships make the result upon all these
breaches of Covenant and Treaties, viz. That they call upon your Lordships to a
duty to GOD, your King and Country, and to your oppressed Brethren in England,
which your Lordships speak more plainly in the next Clause, giving us to
understand, that those differences or breaches are such, as if not repared by
amicable endeavors, may otherwise necessitat this Kingdom to engadge in a
War, but that first your Lordships intend to send the three desires (next
mentioned in the Declaration) to the Parliament of England: And this is all the
satisfaction we find to our second desire, which was, that according to the
Treaties it may be condescended upon, and declared by the Parliament, what are
those breaches of Peace which they take to be ae ground of War, and that
reparation thereof may be sought. But as we see no breach of Peace instanced in
the Declaration, and as the three breaches of Treaties insisted upon by your
Lordships, seem to be at least debatable; So we hear nothing of any resolution
of Parliament, that such breaches as are, or shall be condescended upon by your
Lordships, shall be made known and sent to the Parliament of England, as we
expected and they have desired by their Commissioners here: Only we hear of
three desires to be sent to the Parliament of England for Religion, his
Majesty and the Good and Peace of these Kingdoms: We conceive it is the best
and most justifiable way of proceeding, that public, as well as private
injuries be declared and made known to these whom it concerns to give
satisfaction therein. Besides all this we fear your Lordships will hardly avoid
a National quarrel against the Parliament of England, if the three instances
before mentioned be insisted upon as breaches of Treaty to infer a War;
Because when the Houses were most free, and when there was no such overawing
influence of the Sectaries party, even then they did not suppress the Irishes
in this Kingdom, they did not enforce the Covenant on all their Officers, much
less on all English Subjects, neither would they then admit that they were
obliged by Treaty not to send Propositions or Bills to the King, without the
concurrance of this Kingdom.

In all this that we have said, it is far from our meaning to assume any
judgment of the Treaties between the Kingdoms; Only because your Lordships
have remitted us to the Declaration, for satisfaction to our consciences, as in
other particulars, so in this of the breaches, We have humbly represented to
your Lordships, wherein we are not clear and satisfied in our consciences, to
consent and concur for our part upon such grounds. And withal, seeing it is
not only our desire as Messengers of Peace, but your Lordships prosessed
resolution in this Declaration that you will assay all Brotherly and amicable
ways, for reparing differences and making up breaches, We recommend it to
your Lordships serious thoughts, whether it will not be most agreeable to that
Brotherly way of proceeding between two Kingdoms in Covenant together, to
desire a Treaty with the Parliament of England, concerning the breaches and
demands mentioned in this your Declaration, Especially seeing the way of Treaty
was the way thought fit to be used in the years 1639. and 1640. before the
Kingdoms were joined in Covenant; How much more now, being so conjoined, are
all possible and lawful ways to be tried for preventing the effusion of more
blood.

In your Lordships first demand which concerns Religion, there are some
things where with we can not in our consciences be satisfied, as namely, 1.
Because the first two particulars therein contained, viz. concerning the taking
of the Covenant, and practicing of the Directory of Worship are pressed only
upon Subjects, which may be interpreted as tending to exempt the Kings
Majesty, not only from taking the Covenant, (which yet was laudably desired in
the Propositions of both Kingdoms) but from having the Directory of Worship
practiced in his Family, which was a liberty that his Majesty reserved to
himself in his late Concessions sent to us, and in diverse messages before sent
to the Houses of Parliament at Westminster. 2. We find nothing in this demand
of any application to be made at, or about the same time to the King for
obtaining assurance from his Majesty for his Royal consent; But of this we
have expressed our selves more fully in answer to your Lordships Paper of the
twentiethof this Month. 3 Although this is the second time your Lordships cite
in this Declaration a passage of the joint Declaration of both Kingdoms, by
which all that would not take the Covenant were declared to be public enemies
to their Religion and Country, and that they are to be censured and punished
as professed Adversaries and Malignants; yet we find no such thing declared or
resolved by your Lordships in this Declaration, in reference to those who have
not to this day taken the Covenant, as that you will hold them all for
professed Adversaries and Malignants. We hope your Lordships will not think it
just nor equal to press such a rule upon the Parliament of England, except
your Lordships be pleased to walk according to that rule your selves. 4. Your
Lordships do simply and absolutely desire, that the Confession of Faith
transmitted from the Assembly of Divines at Westminster, to the Houses, be
approven; Whereas the Act of the last General Assembly, approving that
Confession of Faith, has in it some necessary cautions, provisoes, and
explanations, which as the General Assembly judged necessary to be added in
their Act, so we do not think that part of your Lordships demand as itstands
without any such caution to be safe enough: which among other things shows the
danger and inconvenience of your Lordships taking resolutions in things
concerning Religion without our advice and consent, 5. As we desire that,
Reformation of, and Uniformity in Religion, may be endeavored by your
Lordships in all fair, lawful, and brotherly ways according to the Covenant,
and heartily approve any such desire as your Lordships shall send to the
Parliament of England, by the advice and consent of this Kirk, for enjoying the
Covenant, and for bringing the Churches of CHRIST in the three Kingdoms to the
nearest Conjunction and Uniformity in one Confession of Faith, Directory of
Worship, and Presbyteriall Government; So we would be very cautious, and tender
when such desires are turned into causes of War, if not obtained, which is the
present case, as we understand by your Lordships expression in the precedent
paragraphe.

Your Lordships second demand is. That the Kings Majesty may come to some of
his Houses in, or near London, with Honor, Freedom, and Safety, that
applications may be made to him by Parliamonts of both Kingdoms, for attaining
his Royal assent to such desires as shall be by them presented to him for
establishing Religion as is above expressed, and settling a well grounded Peace.

This demand we conceive to be of dangerous consequence to Religion and the
Covenant for the reasons and considerations following, which we humbly offer to
be considered by your Lordships, 1. All applications and desires to his Majesty
for Religion are suspended till he come with Honor, Freedom, and Safety to
some of his Houses, in, or near London; We know not what length of time this
may draw to, or how much danger there may be in the delay. 2. The establishing
of Religion here mentioned, as that which your Lordships intend to desire of
his Majesty, is according to that which is above expressed, where we doubt not
your Lordships refer to your first demand which went before; Whereas the
establishing of Religion in such a manner as is there expressed, we do not
think safe, for the reasons before given. 3. We conceive that this second
demand amounts to no less then the restitution of his Majesty to the exercise
of his Royal Power before Applications made, and desires presented to him,
much more before assurance and security had from him, for the settling of
Religion in the right manner, and according to the Covenant. For besides what
we have expressed in our last Paper presented to your Lordships, that this
honor, freedom, and safety is conceived by your Lordships to be such, as may
enable his Majesty to effectuat his Concessions concerning Religion; And what
is that less then the exercise of his Royal power restored? This we further
add, that we humbly conceive his Majesty's Honor may comprehend, or may be
made use of as comprehending, not only the possession of his Revenews, but also
the exercise of his Royal Government: Next, being in freedom, he may repare
to any part of his Dominions in Scotland, England or Ireland; And lastly, being
restored to be in a condition of safety, he may provide Forces for guarding
Himself against all apprehended dangers, for if Guards should be set about him
by his Parliament, it will be said to be contrary to the condition of freedom:
So that being restored to some of his Houses, in, or near London, with Honor,
Freedom, and Safety, We do not conceive what he shall want of the exercise of
his Royal Power; Considering withal, that neither Himself, nor any others
will conceive the Honor, Freedom, and Safety to be Kingly, and such as
becomes his Royal Person, if he shall want the exercise of his Royal Power:
Yet this restitution of his Majesty to the exercise of his Royal Power,
before security had from him for settling Religion, Your Lordships know by our
eight Desires, and otherwise, is conceived by us to be inconsistent with the
safety and security of Religion. 4. If his Majesty were once come with Honor,
Freedom, and Safety to some of his Houses, in, or near London, We know not
what influences he may have upon the Houses of Parliament to obstruct and
hinder their presenting of Bills to Him, for enjoining the Covenant, abolishing
Prelacy, and the Book of Common Prayer, Establishing the Confession of Faith,
Directory of Worship, and Presbyteriall Government; Or what strength his
Majesty so restored may again attain by the assistance of the Popish,
Prelaticall, and Malignant party, for a new and bloody War, to the devastation
of these Kingdoms, and the ruin of our Religion and Liberties. Which things
we have the more cause to fear and apprehend, his Majesty having declared and
professed, that he is obliged in conscience to improve all the power which GOD
shall put in his hands, for the establishment of Episcopacy. 5. To insist upon
the bringing of his Majesty to some of his Houses, in, or near London, before
satisfaction and security had from him in point of Religion, and in such other
things as are necessary for the safety of the Kingdoms, could not as we
conceive but be an exceeding great discouragement and offense to the
Presbyterians in England, who will conceive (if such a thing be pressed upon
them) that the remedy propounded in your demand is worse then the disease. And
we have also heard, that the Parliament of England, when they were as free as
ever they were, would never agree to his Majesty's coming to London, with
honor, freedom, and safety, without security first had from him in such
things as are necessary for Religion, and the safety of the Kingdom. 6. Seeing
your Lordships are obliged by the third Article of the Covenant, to defend his
Majesty's Person and Authority, in the perservation and defense of the true
Religion, and Liberties of the Kingdoms; We conceive your Lordships should not
demand from, nor press upon the Kingdom of England, His Majesty's restitution
with Honor, Freedom, and Safety, except with that qualification in the
Covenant, and with a subordination to Religion and the Liberties of the
Kingdoms. And how can this subordination according to the Covenant be said to
be observed in your Lordships demand as it stands; for, if His Majesty be
brought to some of His Houses, in or near London, with Honor, Freedom, and
Safety, before so much as applications be made to Him for establishing Religion
and Peace, we then leave it to your Lordships consciences, whether His Majesty
shall not be restored to His Honor, before JESUS CHRIST be restored to His
Honor, and set upon His Throne of Government in His Church: Whether His
Majesty shall not be in a condition of Liberty before the Ordinances of CHRIST
have a free course, and whether His Majesty's safety shall not be provided for
and secured, before either Church, or Kingdom can say they are in a condition
of safety. And is this to endeavor the settling of Religion before all worldly
interests, or rather to make it come after the Kings interest? 7. We fear that
if after so many instructions from the Parliament, Convention, and Committee of
Estates to their Commissioners at London, from time to time, for endeavoring
in the first place, the setlement of Religion, and then to endeavor the
removing of the Civil differences, and the restitution of the King, upon His
first giving satisfaction in Religion and the grounds of a solid Peace; And if
after it was declared by this Kingdom, (during His Majesty's being at
Newcastle) that they could not admit of His Majesty's coming to Scotland in
freedom, unless His Majesty granted the Proposition concerning the Covenant
and Religion, and gave a satisfactory Answer to the rest of the Propositions;
Likewise, if after such a Declaration of the Parliament of this Kingdom,
January 16. 1647. for His Majesty's being in some of His Houses, with such
attendance as the two Houses should think fit, until He give satisfaction in
the Propositions; If after all this it be now insisted upon, that His Majesty
may be restored with Honor, Freedom, and Safety, before such satisfaction had
from Him, we fear it shall lie as a great scandale upon this Kingdom, and as
too sensible and apparent a change of their former principales and professions
in a point so much concerning the security of Religion. 8. We are very
apprehensive, that your Lordships urging the disposal of the Kings Person in
England, in such a way as that he may come to London with Honor, Freedom, and
Safety, without his Majesty's giving, or Your Lordships desiring his Majesty
to give satisfaction and security in Religion, and in such things as belong to
the safety of the Kingdom (without which there can be no lasting security
expected to Religion) As it is a far different point from the urging of a
joint interest in the disposing of the Kings Person by both Kingdoms for the
good of both, So it will be judged by most of all parties in England, that ever
concurred in this Cause, to be so prejudicial to their National Rights and
Liberties, and such an encroachment thereupon (though your eLordships declare
you have no such intention) as that it will unite them all in opposition to
this Kingdom, and consequently alienate them from the intended Uniformity in
Religion, according to the Covenant. As these reasons make us conceive your
Lordships second demand to import no small danger to Religion, So we would not
be understood as if we had any thoughts to decline the restoring of his
Majesty to the same condition he was in, by the agreement of both Kingdoms,
when he was taken away by a party of the Army under the command of Sir Thomas
Fairfax, That both Kingdoms may freely make their applications to Him.

Concerning your Lordships third demand, That the present Army of Sectaries may
be disbanded, for the ends expressed in the demand, As we think no persons
whatsoever fit to be employed or entrusted in the Armies of either Kingdom, we
have not taken the Covenant, And that all Sectaries in England that are in
Arms should be disbanded and disarmed, So we conceive there is also reason for
your Lordships to foresee, and provide against the danger of the rising again
of the Popish Prelaticall and Malignant party in Arms, and the rather, because
of the late commotions begun by some of them both in England and Ireland; These
being also some both in Wales and Ireland actually in arms, who have
discovered and declared their principles and ends to be very Malignant; Wherein
we are informed they are the more animated and encouraged upon confidence of
some agreement between his Majesty and this Kingdom. It is further to be
considered, that this Demand being joined with the second, the present Army in
England disbanded, and his Majesty brought to London with Honor, Freedom,
and Safety, how easily may all the Malignant, Popish and Prelaticall party in
his Majesty's Dominions flock unto him? Which how prejudicial it may be, his
Majesty keeping still his principles, is easy to be judged.

As for the exceptions added in your Lordships demand, to pass the ambiguity
thereof, your Lordships except from the said disbanding, the Garrisons necessary
to be kept in England and desire that these Garrisons may be commanded by such,
as have or shall take the Covenant, and are well affected to Religion and
Government, but do not desire any such thing concerning the Garrisons
themselves; Which may be understood as a tacit Confession on your part that
all the Garrisons to be kept in England, may be of such as have not taken nor
shall take the Covenant, nor are well affected to Religion and Government,
provided that those Garrisons be commanded by such as your Lordships describe.

We have but one point more to add, concerning this third and last demand. For
we cannot conceal our fears and apprehensions, that your present resolutions
and proceedings, and the entertainment of English Soldiers, whereof many are
Papists and Malignants, and some eminent in Malignancy, is not the way to
further, but to retard and hinder the disbanding of the present Army in
England, and to frustrate the en^ your Lordships propose in your Declaration
for the disbanding of that army.

And whereas your Lordships declare, that it is not your intention at all to
make a National engadgement against the Parliament and Kingdom of England,
but for them; As we shall not presume to speak of the Nation (...) Rights and
Privileges of another Kingdom, So we cannot see how the principles of your
Lordships Declaration can consist with the first part of our third desire,
which was; That there may be no such quarrel or ground of the War as may break
the Union between the Kingdoms; For we conceive there are diverse such
quarrels in the Declaration as fall directly and necessarly upon the votes and
proceedings of the Houses of Parliament, even when they were most free.

Concerning that which your Lordships add in reference to the latter part of
our third desire, and to our whole fourth desire. We humbly conceive, it is
very far short of that which is no less your Lordships du^^y then our desire;
for, (...) Your Lordships only declare against Association and Conjunction of
Forces with those who shall refuse to swear and subscribe the Covenant, which
does not exclude Association of Forces with such as neither have taken, nor
shall take the Covenant, so that they be not urged to (...), and so not
reckoned amongst refusers. This we have the more reason to take notice of,
because your Lordships have before in this same Declaration complained that
there is no urging of the Covenant in England, nor no execution of Publict
Orders for taking of the same. Which being so; How shall your Lordships find
the Malignants in England to be refusers of the Covenant, except your Lordships
enforce it upon them, Which we suppose your Lordships intend not to do? 2.
YourLordships do not declare, that if any who have not taken, and shall not
take the Covenant, may not so much as they that shall refuse the Covenant; if
they rise in Arms, your Lordships will oppose them, and endeavor to suppress
them, only your Lordships say, you will not associat nor join Forces with
them. 3. Whereas your Lordships say, That you will be so far from joining, or
associating with the Popish. Prelaticall, or Malignant party, if they shall
again rise in Arms; either to oppose or obstruct! all or any one of the Ends
of the Covenant, that you will oppose and endeavor to suppress them as;
enemies to the Cause and Covenant; We beseech your Lordships to consider,
whether this part of your Declaration does not reserve a latitude, that if the
Popish, Prelaticall, or Malignant party shall rise in Arms for the Kings
restitution; and can but have so much cunning (which is more nor probable) as
to conceal their intentions of obstructing or opposing all, or any one of the
Ends of the Covenant, in such a case it may be free to your Lordships in stead
of opposing or endeavoring to suppress them, that you shall both protect
their persons and estates, and also join or associate Forces with them. In all
which we have the more cause to be full of fears and apprehensions, because of
so many English Malignants, even now protected and entertained in this
Kingdom, in hopes of military employments, yea diverse of them (as we are
informed) such as have served against this Cause and Covenant.

As to that which follows relating to our seventh desire, concerning such as
are to be entrusted in Armies and Committies, we shall need to say no more then
was expressed in our humble Representation, March 29. Namely, that your
Lordships omit in your Answer some of the qualifications expressed in our
desire, viz. such as have given constant proof of their integrity and
faithfulness in this Cause, and against whom there is no just cause of
jealousy, that so we may the more confidently encourage our Flocks to follow
the Cause of GOD in their hands, and not to doubt of their fidelity; Which
qualifications being contained in our desire, and omitted in your Lordships
Answer, we are not without fears, that this omission may be made use of by
some, as if your Lordships had not meant to agree fully to that desire, and so
take occasion to deal for employing and entrusting such in the Committees and
Armies, as may be justly excluded by the qualifications contained in our said
desire.

These things having been before represented to your Lordships, and there
being nothing in your Lordships Declaration to satisfy or take off these our
fears, but such expressions insisted upon as keep aloof from the qualifications
desired by us, all that are unbyased may easily judge whether we have not
herein some real ground to be unsatisfied.

That which follows in the Declaration concerning the rescuing of His
Majesty's Person, that He may come with Honor, Freedom, and Safety so, or
near London, where both Kingdoms may make their applications to Him, for
settling Religion and Peace, we have before spoken fully to it. And whereas your
Lordships add a kind of Salvo in satisfaction to our fifth and sixth desires,
it will plainly appear that these desires are not satisfied by any thing here
expressed in your Lordships Declaration. Your Lordships say, You resolve not to
put in His Majesty's Hands or in any others whatsoever, any such power whereby
any of the ends of the Covenant may be obstructed or opposed: But may it
please your Lordships to give us leave to put you in mind. 1. That your
Lordships words may be understood, either in this sense, that you are not
resolved to put any such Power in His Majesty's Hands, And if so, your
Lordships know, what you resolve not now, you may resolve afterward; Or in
this sense, that your Lordships are resolved that you shall put no such power
in His Majesty's Hands, and if so, then their remains some doubt how far that
power extends, which yourLordships conceive shall not be able to obstruct or
oppose any of the ends of the Covenant, or endanger Religion and Presbyteriall
Government; Or whether it be meant to be extended to His Majesty's negative
voice. 2. When your Lordships say, that you are not resolved to put any such
power in His Majesty's Hands, This needs not hinder your Lordships yielding
and acquiescing if others put such power in His Majesty's Hands; For
resolutions not to do a thing, may stand with resolutions not to hinder it. 3.
When your Lordships have resolved to oppose the putting of any such power in
His Majesty's Hands, as may be destructive to Religion; Yet upon supposition,
that His Majesty is come to London with Honor, Freedom and Safety, we
doubt, whether it may not prove impossible to your Lordships to hinder the
putting of such a power in His Majesty's Hands.

Your Lordships add what assurance you intend to crave from His Majesty for
satisfaction in point of Religion; But withal, we observe three limitations or
qualifications joined therewith, which (so far as we are able to judge) leave
this great point in a very dangerous uncertaintie. 1. Your Lordships resolve,
that His Majesty give this assurance for Religion, before any agreement or
condition to be made with His Majesty, which is the expression chosen by your
Lordships in Head of that clause in our sixth desire, Before his restitution to
the exercise of his Royill Power. If your Lordships expression were only a
more smooth one, with the like security to Religion, (such as your Lordships
Answer March 27. did put us in hopes of) we should have chearefully
acquiesced: but we are so far from perceiving the like security to Religion,
that we rather fear your Lordships qualification may make void and frustrate
the security that we desired. For first, It clearly supposes, that His
Majesty shall come with Honor, Freedom and Safety to London, before any
agreement or condition to be made with Him; For such agreement or condition to
be made with His Majesty being posterior to the assurance to be had from Him
for Religion, must be much more posterior to His Majesty's coming to, or near
London with Honor, Freedom, and Safety, according to the method of
proceedings proposed in the Declaration; Now being once at London, with Honor,
Freedom, and Safety, and that without any agreement or condition made with
Him, it is not probable to us, that His Majesty will then desire any agreement,
or condition, unless it be for some Concessions on His Parliaments part, and
among other Concessions probably somewhat for Episcopacy too, for establishing
whereof, He conceives Himself obliged in conscience to make use of His Power
as was before observed. The result of this point that we humbly conceive is,
that notwithstanding of that clause, before any agreement or condition to be
made with His Majesty, or any thing else in the Declaration, His Majesty may be
restored to the exercise of His Royal Power before security had from Him for
Religion as we desired.

The next qualification added by your Lordships, immediately is in these words,
having found His late Concessions and offers concerning Religion not
satisfactory; where first, the words having found, may be variously understood,
either, when His Majesty shall have found, or, when your Lordships shall have
found, or, because His Majesty has found, or, because your Lordships have
found.

Next, the words, not satisfactory, are as doubtful, and may e interpreted in
several senses, either that His Majesty's late Concessions and Offers
concerning Religion, are not satisfactory in themselves, or, that they are
neither satisfactory to your Lordships, nor to us, or the meaning may be only,
that they are not satisfactory to us. Which doubtfulnesse in the sense of the
words we have more cause to observe, because your Lordships have not hitherto
returned us any clear or positive answer to our fifth desire: That His
Majesty's late Concessions and Offers concerning Religion, as they have been by
the Church, so may be by the Parliament declared unsatisfactorie, Only your
Lordships are pleased here to make a light transition over that which we
conceived to be unto us a grave subject of a Solemn Declaration.

The third qualification in the assurance to be required from his Majesty, is,
that he shall agree to such Act or Acts of Parliament, and Bills, as shall be
presented unto Him by His Parliaments of both or either Kingdoms respectively
for enjoining the Covenant, and establishing the Presbyteriall Government,
Directory of Worship and Confession of Faith in all His Majesty's Dominions.
But we humbly conceive, it were more for the glory of GOD, good of Religion,
and his Majesty's own happiness, that his Majesty should after the example of
the Godly reforming Kings of Judah, and of the best Christian Emperors of old
in the Christian Church, declare his own zeal and forwardness for the
Reformation, and settling Religion, and that your Lordships should do well to
solicit and incite his Majesty hereunto, rather then to seem to yield so
far, as that his Majesty shall be free for his part, till his Parliaments of
both or either Kingdoms respectively agree what Acts or Bills to present to
him; The preparing and presenting whereof, how much it may be retarded and
obstructed by the prevalency both of Malignants and Secretaries, we know not:
Seeing therefore His Majesty owes a duty both to God and to his people for
the Reformation and setlement of Religion, your Lordships may do better to
solicit his Majesty, and to desire that he will positively declare himself
willing and ready for his part and for that duty which is incumbent to his
Majesty, and that he give assurance for the same in the particulars. Your
Lordships further declare in reference to our eighth and last desire, that you
are willing to subjoine to the ground of your undertaking an Oath, wherein both
in the framing thereof and otherwise your Lordships are willing the Church
shall have their due interest is formerly in the like cases; Where, as we know
not how far your Lordships meaning does reach in the word, otherwise, and in
the word, due; So we know not why your Lordships did not think fit to agree to
our desire as it was conceived, and as the words stood, viz. That there may be
na engagement without a Solemn Oath, Wherein the Kirk may have the same:
interest which they had in the Solemn League and Covenant, which define is so
far unsatisfied, that for our interest in the matter of the Oath, and in the
grounds of the undertaking, we do not see it allowed or preserved to us, But
rather that the Declaration holds forth the grounds of the undertaking
already resolved upon by your Lordships; Only leaving us an interest inthe
form of an Oath to be subjoined, and that not without some uncertain and
dubious qualifications, as has been touched. Mean while we see only a
Declaration without an Oath; And as Declarations are alterable by Parliaments,
and their proceedings sometimes not agreeable to their Declarations (which the
experience of these times has taught us:) so it there were an Oath subjoined
to the grounds of undertaking expressed in this Declaration, we could not
account it a lawful Oath, but that it would make the bussinesse worse.

Your Lordships add somewhat further, relating to the matter of our first and
second desires, namely, That your Lordships are resolved not to engage in any
War before the necessity and lamfulnesse thereof be cleared, so as all who are
well affected may be satisfied therewith, and that reparation to such breaches
and injuries as are, or shall be condescended upon, shall be demanded in such a
just and sit way as shall be found most lawful and expedient. This clause, as
likewise that which follows, that many of the dangers with the grounds and
resolutions, are by this Declaration of your Lordships made known to this
Kingdom, seems to hold us in suspense, till all the dangers grounds and
resolutions be made known, and till the lawfulness and necessity of the War
be cleared, and the way of seeking reparation resolved upon; Yet your
Lordships may be pleased to remember, that in that part of your Answer to us
of the twentieth, which is a return to our desire of knowing fully your
Lordships resolutions, and being satisfied on the whole matter, we were
remitted to the Declaration, is containing the grounds and resolutions of the
Parliament on the whole matter.

As to that which follows, concerning a present putting of the Country in a
posture of defense as in Anno, 1643. we should be glad it were made to appear
really that the grounds, principles and ends were the same now, they were in
the year 1643. Otherwise the like Act upon different grounds, and for different
ends make it not the same cause. Your Lordships do indeed speak of the
principles expressed in the Declaration, as the same with the first principles
contained in our National Covenant, and in the Solemn League and Covenant.
But what reason we have to conceive they are new and different principles, may
appear by the several particulars before mentioned. We cannot here pass a new
interpretation which the Declaration puts upon the Solemn League and Covenant,
viz. That we did Solemnly swear and promise before God and his Angels, to
endeavor Reformation of, and Uniformitie in Religion and Church Government in
all his Majesty's Dominions according to the Word of GOD, and the Example of
the best reformed Churches; Where we pass your Lordships limiting and
restricting of Uniformity more then the Covenant does: which may infer that
Uniformity in Church Government between the Churches of CHRIST in these three
Covenanted Kingdoms, is not to be urged in any other manner or measure then we
have a precedent of in other reformed Kirks; but that which here we chiefly
aim at, is the following clause of the Declaration; viz. And not only to the
utmost of our power, with our means and lives to stand to the defense of our
dread Sovereign, his Person and Authority in the preservation of the true
Religion and Liberties of the Kingdom, but also in every cause which may
concern His Majesty's Honor, to concur according to the Laws of this Kingdom
and duty of good subjects. Yet your Lordships know that no such interpretation
has been made by the Assemblies of the Kirk of the Solemn League and
Covenant, as your Lordships are pleased here to make of it. If it be said, that
your Lordships meaning was only of our National Covenant, yet it may be
observed withal, that the plain and grammatical construction of the words
will carry that interpretation either upon the Solemn League and Covenant
only, or both upon it and upon our National Covenant. How ever, although our
National Covenant only were here fixed upon, concerning which there is such an
expression in the supplication of the General Assembly, Anno 1639. to his
Majesty's Commissioner and the Lords of Secret Counsel, yet there are some
weighty considerations which we humbly offer against the application of that
Supplication of the Assembly, to the present business; for, 1. His Majesty
was at that time giving satisfaction to the public desires of this Kirk
concerning Religion; We heartily wish we might say the like now. 2. We do not
see the Cause stated in the Declaration to be for his Majesty's Honor, and so
to fall within that duty expressed in the Declaration of the General
Assembly. And as one of the ends of the Covenant was His Majesty's Honor and
Happiness, and your Lordships also have acknowledged in your Oath of
Parliament, that the Honor, Happiness, and Greatness of the Kings Majesty,
does depend on the Purity of Religion as it is now established in this
Kingdom, So whatsoever crosses or prejudiceth the grounds of the Covenant, or
any of the ends thereof, cannot with us find any such commendation as to be a
cause which concerns his Majesty's Honor. 3. Whatsoever we owe to the King
in civil matters distinct from the Cause of Religion, sure all these other
duties are with a subordination to the glory of God, and good of Religion, and
we are very confident it was, and will be far from the thoughts of the General
Assembly, under color of his Majesty's Honor to concur with Him, or any in
His Name, in a cause which is hurtful and prejudicial to the good of
Religion, and to the other ends of the Solemn League and Covenant, yet the
cause stated in the Declaration, we humbly conceive to be such. 4. It may be
remembered that the Crosse-petition having cited the same clause of the said
Petition of the General Assembly, and making use thereof in order to an
engadgement in War in his Majesty's quarrel against the Parliament of England,
was declared against by the Commission of the General Assembly, Anno 1643. And
among other particulars it was then declared, that the limitations expressly
mentioned in the words cited out of the Assemblies Supplication, viz. according
to the Laws of this Kingdom, and duty of good Subjects were interpreted by
some that spoke at the time in the General Assembly to be all one, as if it
had been said, within this Kingdom, we not knowing of any Laws of this
Kingdom or further extent. It was also then observed and may now be applied
and remembered, that the National Covenant having been subscribed in the Years
1581. and 1590. before King James was King of England, and being qualified in
the particular Heads and Articles by express limitations and restrictions to
this Kirk and Kingdom, to the Religion, Laws and Liberties of Sotland, can no
more be extended to municipall debates, and to the Laws and Liberties of
England, unto which we are strangers, then the Kingdom of England can judge of
our Laws, and determine our differences, the two Kingdoms being still
independent each on other, and not subordinate one to another, as the first
Article of the large Treaty fully declares.

As to that we find in the close of the Declaration, that this Kingdom of
Scotland will now make it evident, as they have often declared, that their
quietness, stability, and happiness does depend upon the safety of the Kings
Majesty's Person and maintenance of His Greatness, and Royal Authority, who
is Gods Vicegerent set over us, for Maintenance of Religion, and Ministration
of Justice, we shall only put your Lordships in mind, that your National
Covenant joineth with his Majesty's Safety, his good behavior in his Office:
and says, That the quietness and stability of our Religion and Kirk does
depend upon the safety, and good behavior of his Majesty, as upon a
comfortable Instrument of GODS Mercy granted to this Country for the
Maintenance of his Kirk, and Ministration of Justice. Otherwise, if a King do
not his duty for the Maintenance of the true Religion, and Ministration of
Justice, It is not His safety alone, that make His People to be in quietness
and happiness; Withal, as our quietness and happiness depends on his
Majesty, and his doing of his duty as an Instrument and Minister of God for
good; So the Honor, Greatness, and Happiness of the Kings Royal Majesty,
and the welfare of the Subjects, depend upon the purity of Religion, as is well
expressed in your Lordships Oath of Parliament.

And now we shall with your Lordships favor and permission make this
conclusion upon the whole matter, That as we neither were nor are against an
engadgement with this Kingdom in War, but have been and shall be willing to
consent thereto, If once satisfied in our conscience concerning the clearnes,
lawfulness, and necessity of the Cause, and quatrell, and concerning our
calling, manner of proceeding, Instruments to be entrusted, security to be had
for Religion, and other particulars contained in our former Papers not yet
satisfied by your Lordships. So we are necessitate to profess and declare to
your Lordships, that we cannot, we dare not in our consciences agree to an
engagement upon such grounds, and in such a way as is stated in your Lordships
Declaration: And therefore, for our exoneration do dissent from the whole
complex business in the said Declaration, as not containing clear and
convincing grounds of undertaking of a War, not providing for the security of
Religion, nor clearly disclaiming his Majesty's late Concessions and offers as
unsatisfactory, not tending to the suppression of the Malignant party, but
rather to compliance with them, as we humbly conceive, nor preserving the
Liberties and known interest of the Kirk nor proposing the way of Treaties, and
all other possible ways of Peace to be sought and assayed before a War. For
which reasons, and others before mentioned, upon the particular heads of the
Declaration, we plainly declare our dissent from the complex circumstantiat
state of the present business contained in the said Declaration, And take to
witness, GOD, Angels, and Men, that your Lordships have not wanted warning
from the Watchmen, And that we shall be free of all the distractions,
confusions, miseries and blood, which may follow upon your Lordships proceeding
to an engadgement in War, upon the grounds of the Declaration. We further call
to record, the Searcher of all hearts, and the righteous Judge of all the
World. That our not concurring proceeds not from want of zeal against
Sectaries, nor from any remissenes in that which may concern his Majesty's true
Honor, and Happiness, and the preservation of Monarchical Government in Him
and His Posterity, nor from any want of tenderness of the Privileges of
Parliament, nor from any want of Sympathy with our afflicted and oppressed
Brethren in England, In reference to all which our proceedings have been, and
shall be (we trust) real Testimonies of our affection and sincerity; But our
not concurring proceeds merely from tenderness in the point of security of
Religion, and Union between the Kingdoms, and from the unsatisfactorinesse of
the grounds of your Lordships Declaration as has been expressed in the
particulars. Wherefore we humbly beseech your Lordships to interpret favorably
and charitably any liberty which we have used, (the matter being such as lies
sad and weighty, upon our Consciences.) And that your Lordships would also be
pleased to be mindful of making good that passage of your Declaration, where
you say that you unresolved not to engadge in any War, before the necessity
and, lawfulness thereof be cleared, so (...) all who are well affected may be
satisfied therewith; Which (...) your Lordships shall be pleased to do there is
a door of Hope yet open, and we shall not cease to pray unto the Lord (as he
shall assist us) that a Spirit of Counsel and Understanding and of the fear of
the LORD may be upon you, and that GOD would graciously rid both your Lordships
and us out of all hid and lurking snares, and so guide your Lordships, as that
there may be yet a sweet and harmonious joining of hearts and hands upon right
Principles Grounds and motives, in a right way, and for the right Ends.

FINIS.
