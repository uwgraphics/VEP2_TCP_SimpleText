Moses's Song, on Exodus 15.
1
I To the Lord, will sing,
Triumph in him also;
The Horses and the Riders he
Into the Sea did throw.
2
Jehovah is my Song,
And my Salvation;
My God, for whom I will prepare
An Habitation:
3
My Father's God was he,
Whose Glory I Will proclaim,
Jehovah is a Man of War,
Jehovah is his Name.
4
Proud Pharaoh, and his Host,
Into the Sea are cast,
And his great Captains drowned be,
As through the Sea they past.
5
They down to the bottom sank,
Even like unto a Stone;
Jehovah thy Right Hand in Power,
Most Glorious is become:
6
Thy Right Hand has destroyed
Those that against thee rose;
And in thy Glorious Excellency,
Thou have overthrown thy Foes.
The second Part.
1
Thou did send forth thy Wrath,
Like stubble them to waste,
Lord, thou did blow, and the proud Waves,
Overwhelmed them with a Blast.
2
The Sea stood up in heaps
For Israel, (on each side)
The Enemy said, I will pursue,
I will the Spoil divide?
3
My Lust I will fulfill,
My Sword draw out will I?
My Hand shall now cut them all off,
And Ruin utterly?
4
Thou with thy Wind did blow,
And they were covered,
They in the Mighty Waters sunk,
As if they had been Lead.
5
Lord, who is like to Thee,
In Holiness Glor'us,
Fearful in Praise, and also does
Things that are mavelous.
A Prophetical Part of Moses's Song, Deuteronomy. 32.
1
GIve Ear, O Heavens, I will speak,
and let also the Earth,
Hear the good Words of my own Mouth,
which now I shall bring forth,
2
My Doctrine like the Rain shall drop,
my Speech distill shall as
The Dew does on the tender Herbs,
and showers on the Grass.
3
Because that I Jehovahs Name
will publish and make known;
I will ascribe greatness to God,
yea, and to him alone.
4
He is the Rock, and Perfect too
his Ways and Judgments be;
A God of Truth, and without Sin,
both Just and Right is he.
3
Because their Rock unto our Rock
is not to be compared;
Yea, though our Enemies themselves,
as Judges should be heard:
5
Vengeance is mine, I will repay,
in time their Feet shall slide,
Their dreadful Day it does draw near,
and Woe shall them betide.
6
Because the Lord his Saints shall judge,
and for them he will Repent,
When none shut up, or lift he sees,
when all their Powers's spent.
7
Then sing ye Nations with his Saints,
revenge their Blood will he,
And render Vengeance to his Foes,
but kind to his Saints be.
The Song of the Prophet Isaiah. chap. 5.
1
I To my Well-beloved, now,
and of his Vineyard (will
Sing a sweet Song) which he has set,
upon a fruitful Hill;
2
He Fenced it, and gathered out
the Stones that did offend,
He Planted it with choicest Vine,
and it he did defend:
3
A Tower in the midst he built,
and made a Wine Press too,
And looked that it should bring forth Fruit,
his Glory great to show;
4
But it brought forth Wild Grapes: Alas!
to thee, Jerusalem,
And Judah also I Will appeal,
and to all thinking Men;
5
'Twixt Me and my Vineyard to Judge;
what further do could I
Unto my Vineyard? when I loo'kt,
no Fruit could I espy:
6
Instead of Grapes, it did bring forth
Wild Grapes: O then go to,
Unto my Vineyard, I Will declare
what it is that I will do.
7
I Will take away the Hedge thereof,
my Anger shall be shown,
Eat up it shall, and it is strong Wall
shall quite be overthrown;
8
And I will lay it Waste, and it
not Dig, nor Prune again;
But there shall come Briars and Thorns,
and on it fall no Rain.
9
For the House of Israel, and
the Men of Judah be
The pleasant Vineyard of the Lord;
but when he looked to see
10
Judgment and true Justice done,
Oppression did espy;
And when he looked for Righteousness,
behold! a bitter Cry.
Isaiah's Joyful Song. Isa. 12.
1
JEhovah I will give thee Praise,
this is the very Day,
For thou do sweetly Comfort me,
thine Anger's turned away:
2
Behold thou my Salvation art,
I will not be afraid,
Jehovah is my Strength and Song,
my Trust and saving Aid:
3
Therefore with Gladness I will draw
Water out of the Wells
Of Salvation (for they be
thy People Isreal's.
4
And in that Day shall ye all say,
praise the Lord, on his Name
Not only call, but for his Acts
lift up his glor'us Fame.
5
Sing ye unto the Lord, for he
most excellent things has done;
And this throughout the Earth also,
is now most fully known.
6
Cry out, and shout, and joyful be,
all that in Sion dwell;
For great the Holy One's in Thee,
O happy Israel!
The Song of Zacharias.
1
LEt Israel's great God and King
eternally be Blessed,
Whose come from Heaven to visit us,
and see our bonds, released.
2
In David's House a Savior's raised,
to sit upon his throne;
This ever since the World began,
his Prophets have foreshown.
3
That he would save us from the Power
and Malice of our Foes;
The Mercy to perform to them,
which he of old had chose.
4
He called to mind how he engaged
his truth, by Covenant,
His Solemn Oath to Abraham sworn,
that he his Grace would grant
5
To serve him without fear; from all
our Adversaries freed;
And to continue all our days,
a Holy Life to lead.
6
By the Remission of our Sins,
to make Salvation known,
To all his People every where,
his tender Mercy's shown.
7
The Day Star from on high is rose,
and those who also sit
In Darkness, he in the right way
of Peace will guide their Feet.
The Song of the Blessed Virgin. Luke. 1.
1
MY Soul does magnify the Lord,
my Spirit does rejoice
In God, my Savior, who deserve
the Praise of Heart and Voice.
2
For his poor Handmaid he regards,
whose Mind was sore deprest;
And all Ages from hence forth shall
call me most truly Blessed.
3
He that is great has Wonders done,
and holy is his Name;
His Mercies has for ever been
to his Saints, still the same.
4
He with his Strength has pulled down
the Mighty from their Seat;
And them of Low and Base Degree,
are raised to Honor great.
5
He filled the Hungry Soul, with Good,
the Rich Empty remained;
His Mercy he has called to mind,
his People help have gained.
9
The Promise to our Fathers made,
in the which he long stood,
Engaged to Abraham and his Seed,
he has at last made good.
The Song of Simeon, Luke, 2. 29.
1
NOw let thy Servant, Lord, depart
in Peace, to quiet Rest,
Since I have thy Salvation seen,
and with the same am blessed:
2
The Prophecies are now fulfilled,
thy Promises are true;
And thy Mysterious Love's disclosed,
in all thy Peoples view.
3
A Light to lighten the Dark Earth,
now this bright Sun appears,
The Gentiles shall enlightened be,
sweet Comforts shall them cheer.
4
Well may the long expected Sight,
make Israel's Joy abound;
Before with special Favors Graced,
but now with Glory Crowned.

In thy Salvation joy will I.

No, no, there is none beside thee
Of other Rocks, there is not one;
That to our God compared may be.

Let not Arrogance once proceed
Out of your Mouth, for God does know,
And it is by him Actions are weighed.

He raises up and pulls down;
Thee Poor he up from Dust does take,
And Beggars from the Dunghill Crown.

In Glorious Power and Dignity;
The Pillars of the Earth's the Lords,
The World is his, him Glorifies.

Preserves them so they shall not fail,
The Vile in darkness shall be still,
For no man shall by strength prevail.

The Adversaries of the Lord,
Shall broken be both great and small;
The Lord from Heaven Thunder will,
And in his Wrath destroy them all,
8
The Lord shall Reign most Gloriously,
Unto the ends of all the Earth:
And his Anointed Horn exalt,
Therefore his highest Praise sing forth.

A Song of Praise for the Mavelous Deliverance of our Sovereign King,
WILLIAM, with the Church, and whole Kingdom, from the Hellish Plot, Discovered,
Feb. 1695/6
1
NO change of Time shall ever shock
Our firm Affections, Lord to Thee;
For thou have always been a Rock,
A Fortress and Defense to me.
2
Our KING Preserved is, O God,
By thy own hand and mighty Power;
Thou Shield'st him when he is Abroad,
At home to him a lasting Tower.
3
The Chariot of the King of kings,
Or Troops of mighty Angels round,
Encompass him with Rapid Wings,
And all his Foes with Shame Confound.
4
Black Thundering Clouds most thick conspired,
With Threatening Rage our Face to Veil,
But at thy brightness soon retired:
Upon our foes falls Fire and Hail.
5
The Lord does on our Side engage,
From Heaven his Throne Our Cause upheld,
And snatched us from the Furious Rage
Of Threatening Waves that Proudly Swelled;
6
God his resistless Power employed,
Our cruel Foes attempts to break;
Or else they might have soon destroyed
The best Defense that we could make.
7
And Gods Designs shall still Succeed;
Romes Bloody Sons cannot stand the TEST,
He Is a Strong Shield to all that need,
And on his sure Protection rest.

Or who, except the mighty Lord,
Can with resistless Power defend.

The Rock, on whose Defense we rest
Over highest Heavens his Name be raised,
Who with Salvation us has bless'd'
10
Therefore to celebrate his Fame,
Our greatfull Voices to Heaven we'll raise,
Let Nations round dread his great Name,
And all be Taught to Sing his Praise.
11
God to our King and Nation sends
(Though Vile we be) Salvation sweet,
Deliverance to his Saints extends,
To Praise his Name therefore it is meet.
12
Hosannahs we to thee do owe,
Let all the Nations Worship thee,
And thee adore, yea thee alone,
The Father of Eternity.
13
Thy Name in Songs we will adore
Protect thy Saints, and Keep them Pure;
To thee lets live for Evermore,
Since from Cursed Plots we are secure.
A FEAST OF Fat Things etc. Containing, One Hundred Sacred Hymns, etc.
CENTURY 1.
HYMN 1.
The Eternity of the Great GOD.
IN the Regions of Eternal Light,
thou have most Holy God;
From everlasting in thy Self,
had thy own blessed abode:
Before this World by thee was framed,
or, Earth's Foundations laid;
Or, the vast Heavens were spread forth
or any Creature made.
3
Thou did in Glory, Lord, abide;
thy being had alone,
In thy own Self, and none beside,
was with the Holy One.
4
The Eternity of thy great Name,
help us, Lord, to Adore:
From everlasting thy dread Fame
shone, and shall Evermore.
5
Thou Happy wast in thy own Self,
and that in the highest degree;
To thy essential Glory, Lord,
nothing can added be,
6
Thou need'st not us; What can thou have
from any Creatures hand?
Yet to ascribe all Praise to Thee,
is thy most just Command.
HYMN 2.
The Immensity of GOD,
THe Praise of the dread Majesty
of the great God above,
With trembling Heart I would sing forth,
O with him fall in Love!
2
But what am I? poor sorry Dust
that I should God admire!
Be silent then, and let us give place
unto the Heavenly Quire!
3
Thousands, and ten Thousands more
of glorious Angels, stand
'Round thy high Throne, and Thee adore
in Songs at thy Command.
4
Hosannahs they sing unto Thee,
O Lord, continually.
They worship and most perfect be;
but, Ah! what, Lord, am I?
5
A Person of polluted Lips!
how shall I then express
The depth of thy Immensity?
or thy Infiniteness?
6
I from thy Presence cannot go;
what place, alas! is there
To hide from Thee? for I do know,
Lord, thou art every where!
HYMN 3.
On the Immensity and Omniscience of GOD.
THy Knowledge, Lord, is infinite,
there is nothing hid from Thee;
Thou see in the Dark as in the Light,
our Thoughts before thee be.
2
From sight of thy All-seeing Eye,
O whither can we go!
In all dark Places thou do pry,
thine Eyes walk to and fro.
3
Through the whole Earth, where can we hide?
O! whither can we fly?
Lord, from thy Presence; for thou art
far off, and also nigh!
4
Shall we to Heaven mount alost,
lo, Thou art present there?
Or, if we should go down to Hell,
even there thou do appear?
5
Yea, should we take us morning Wings
and dwell beyond the Sea,
There would thy Hand have hold on us,
and quickly with us be?
6
Nay, if we say, The Darkness shall
shroud us, Lord, from thy Sight,
Alas! the thickest Darkness is
to Thee, like to the Light?
7
Yea, Darkness hides not from Thee,
but Night does shine as Day:
Let Us Praise Thee then both Day and Night,
and sing to Thee always!
HYMN 4.
The Wisdom of GOD great.
1
WE of thy Wisdom will, O Lord,
not only speak but sing;
For it is from hence that all true Good
to us, O Lord, does spring.
2
Thy Wisdom and most Sovereign Grace
most gloriously do shine;
Let us see it with open Face,
and Praise that Name of thine.
3
In thy own Wisdom let us be Wise;
thy Wisdom let us Adore,
And trust in it, so shall we, Lord,
sing Praise for Evermore.
4
Thy Wisdom is a mighty deep,
which Angels do admire;
Creation-Work demonstrates it,
Redemption rises higher.
5
The wonder of thy Wisdom, Lord,
and sublime Rule likewise,
It Is over all Things, and Persons here,
and marv'lous in our Eyes.
6
All Wisdom Saints and Angels have,
from Thee it does proceed;
And from thy Wisdom we receive
all good things we do need.
7
Of thy amazing Wisdom then
we'll sing continually;
And unto Thee, let Foolish Men
for Wisdom daily cry!
HYMN 5.
GOD's piercing Eyes.
1
YE Saints remember God always,
remember he is nigh;
Nay, with us all in every place,
and on us sets his Eye.
2
O Lord, out of thy piercing Sight
there is none of us can go;
Thou see in Darkness as in Light,
and know all things we do.
3
It Is thy most great and glorious Name
we should for ever Fear;
And unto thee loud Praise proclaim,
when to thee we draw near.
4
Always let us, O Lord, we pray,
set Thee before our eyes,
And never grieve thy Spirit, Lord,
by our Iniquities.
5
Let Us have a reverent awe of Thee,
and always Thee adore
And worship in Sincerity;
so sing for Evermore.
HYMN 6.
The Power of GOD.
1
WHo knows, Lord, what thy Power is,
thou Glorious art in Might;
Can ought be hard for Thee to do,
whose Power's Infinite.
2
Thine Arm of Strength, most mighty King,
both Rocks and Hearts does break;
O God thou can do every thing
which thou do undertake.
3
Over Men and Angels thou do Reign,
all things thou do uphold;
Thou art the strength of all thy Saints,
thy Power's manifold.
4
Thou power have for to Create,
redeeming Pow'r's in Thee;
Thou soon can too annihilate
all things which we de see.
5
None can before thy Power stand,
nor thy dread Strength resist;
Thy Pleasure thou will do we Know,

HYMN 9.
A Sacred Hymn on GOD's Sovereignty.
1
THou Lord who did all Creatures make,
have Power to dispose
Of them, as seems good to thee:
some therefore thou did Choose
2
Unto Eternal Life and Bliss;
and others did Pass-by:
Or did them leave to their Hearts Lusts,
and vile Iniquity.
3
If thou had left all Adams Race
Unto their evil Way,
And not have given one Soul thy Grace,
O who dur'st Thee gainsay!
4
Or have charged thee to be Unjust,
since all deserved to Die,
It Is Infinite Grace that any be
saved Eternally.
5
Thou sendest thy Sweet Gospel Light
to this, and to that Place,
But do to many Lands deny
the word of thine own Grace:
6
And some that hear it never feel
its Power on their heart;
All is as thou art pleased to act,
and sovereign Grace impart.
7
We therefore Lord exalt thy Name,
that with our eyes do see,
Since thou have made the difference,
all Praise belongs to thee.
HYMN 10.
GOD's glorious Bounty: Or, Grace shining.
1
THy Love, O Lord, is very great
to such vile Ones as we;
Such who lay Dead in Trespasses,
are quickened by thee:
2
Thy Bounty to these Souls of ours;
who can of it conceive:
And those thou do Regenerate
this Bounty do receive.
3
It Is they who are delivered
from that Forelorn Estate,
They once were in, when they lay Dead;
whose souls, Lord, did thee Hate.
4
It Is they whose Souls united be
unto thy self, O Lord,
And have Communion too with thee,
thou do this Grace afford.
5
Death cannot dissolve this blessed Knot,
this union does remain;
At Death such do to Jesus go,
Death unto them is gain.
6
Well may such say unto their Souls,
Return unto your rest!
For they at Death to Glory go,
and ly in thy Sweet Breast.
7
Their they do join with Seraphims,
in blessed Harmony,
To Sing and Celebrate thy Praise
unto Eternity.
HYMN II.
Abounding Mercy of God in Christ.
1
IS there no Mercy in the Lord?
sinners! can you say so?
Of Mercy sing with one accord,
Mercy does overflow!
2
The Waters which are in the Sea,
and Light that is in the Sun,
Are fewer than thy Mercies are,
to sinners quite undone.
3
Thy Bowels yearn in thee to those
who in their Blood do ly;
If they Believe thou will forgive
all their Iniquity:
4
But some will not thy Mercy have,
they it do not desire;
In the right Way, do it not crave;
nor after it enquire!
5
But you that see the Chanel, where
Mercy does sweetly run,
Exalt God's Name, and sing his Praise,
until your Lives are done.
6
At Death and in the Judgment-day,
God's mercy you shall find,
If you do leave your evil Ways
and have a changed Mind.
7
Redeeming Mercy that is sweet,
and Pardoning Mercy sure;
In Christ all Mercies join and meet,
and evermore endure.
HYMN 12.
The Patience of God.
1
WHat Wrongs, great God, have thou long born?
(conceived they cannot be!)
By daring Rebels, who provoke
Thee unto Jealousy!
2
All Evils done in every place,
before thine Eyes they are
Throughout the World; And yet dostthou
these Foes protect, and spare.
3
Though for Man's Treason down he fell,
by thy revenging Hand;
Yet he lifts up his bruised Bones
his Maker to withstand;
4
And, though a feeble Foe he be,
whom thou like Moths can crush,
Yet still against the Bosses of
thy Bucklar he does rush.
5
O what vile Monsters are Mankind!
thus given to Rebel!
Strange thou do not, Lord, smite the Earth,
and send them quick to Hell!
6
Man's sin for Vengeance loudly cries,
yet Patience does abound;
Though Justice cries, Cut these Trees down!
Why Cumber they the Ground?
7
Thy Patience still sorbears, we see,
O it is Infinite!
Therefore of it, we, Lord, will sing,
and Praise Thee Day and Night.
HYMN 13.
Another on God's Patience.
1
WOuld Man forbear to seek revenge
on such a cursed Foe,
Who strives to Murder him each Day,
and work his Overthrow?
2
But God waves all advantages
of wrath, and vengeance too;
And, by amazing Patience,
does daring Man outdo?
3
The Creature does disdain his God,
by whom he is clothed and fed,
Yet God still spares this rebel Worm,
who by the Devil's led
4
To fight against his Sovereign
with cruel spite and rage;
Yet God does still forbear with him,
even from Age to Age.
5
Fools ask not where the Almighty is,
but Glory to him give:
Is not his Being most fully proved
in suffering thee to Live?
6
Was he not GOD, he could not bear
such Weights as on him ly;
Weak Mortals soon are set on fire,
and for revenge do cry!!
7
Why should not Patience make us sing,
and God's great Glory raise?
Lord, let thy Patience join with Love
toward me all my Days!
HYMN 14.

And bear thy dreadful Wrath, O God,
unto Eternity.
3
And therefore Jesus thou did send,
no Friend had we to bring;
All good from hence, we may perceive,
does from thy Bowels spring,
4
'Twas from the Worth and Dignity
which in Christ's Person lay,
He did God's Justice satisfy,
and all our Debts defray.
5
O let Men dread how they despise
such sovereign Grace and Love,
Because Mysterious in their Eyes,
and also far above
6
Depraved Reason to conceive,
that such who guilty be,
Should, by another's Righteousness,
from Sin and Guilt be free.

And to the Holy Ghost likewise,
be Praise for Evermore.

It Is Jesus Praise that we will raise,
and set his Glory forth;

to Die upon the Tree!
Therefore, O Lord, with one accord
we will sing Praise to thee.

Thou have a Salve for every sore;
did Dye that we might Live
Therefore to thee continually
all Praises we will give.
HYMN 37.
The voice of the Turtle heard in our Land.

Which purchased Grace my soul to change,
when shall this work begin:
2
In sinners hearts, O now impart,
that Grace that they may sing:
O own thy word, most holy Lord,
our God, and gracious King!
3
The harmless Turtle's pleasant voice
is heard, Lord, in this place;
Let Fig Trees put forth their green Figs,
young Converts deck with Grace.
4
Arouse! the Summer will soon pass,
your day of grace will end;
O come to Christ, whilst he does call,
and does his love commend!
5
See how the Saints do bud in Grace,
what gracious fruits abound,
Upon this liberty for all
to hear the joyful sound:
6
Arise, you who yet sleep in Sin,
make have to come and live;
So shall you sing and joyful be,
and honor to Christ give.
HYMN 38.
-- Buy of me.
1
COme buy of thee? Lord let us see
what it is that thou do sell!
The Pearl of Price and Paradise,
O Lord what Tongue can tell
2
What their worth are! what Fool is there
who does refuse to buy?
A bargain's here! and 'twill appear
so to Eternity.
3
This Pearl excells the rich Beryl,
the Onyx and the Sapphire;
Rubies so rare cannot with it compare,
no, nor the gold of Ophir!
4
Begone vile Lusts as things accursed,
let every Soul then say,
This Pearl will I purchase and buy
without further delay?
5
Let Us look about, our Glass runs out,
and take such good Advice;
What ever you see the terms to be,
to come unto the Price.

who this rich Pearl have;
What would you be, what more can ye
ask, seek, desire, or crave?

For you shall live for evermore,
yea, live and never die.
3
Behold a bleeding Christ! O see
his side, how did it run
With purple Gore? Can ye forbear
to grieve, shed tears, and mourn!
4
But did he die, and in our stead,
that we might never die?
O love this Lord, and sing his Praise;
and on him all rely!
5
The fruits of Christ's most blessed Death
in bleeding Hearts appear;
Their sins, they see, have wounded him,
and pierced him like a spear.
6
They look to him, therefore they mourn,
and yet by Faith rejoice;
They cannot but grieve, nor yet forbear
to sing with cheerful Voice.
HYMN 40.

The King with joy does them behold,
and loves to look upon.
6
How may we then continually
in Jesus Christ rejoice,
And sing to him melodiously,
with Heart and cheerful Voice?

But Woe to them who do oppose
his Grace, his Grace so free!
3
Lord not to us, not unto us,
but to thy Glorious Name,
Let all the Glory be ascribed,
the Honor and the Fame.

to Jesus we must fly,
His Righteousness, and his alone
is comely in thine Eye.

free Pardon of our Sin;

that Glorious work within:

But Faith, which does us Justify,
most Precious Fruit does bear,
True Faith, O Lord, does Purify
the Heart, if it be there.
7
Ye Righteous sing unto the Lord,
his Praise do you set forth
And let all People look to him,
to the ends of the Earth.

BEhold, and Wonder now,
in a most sacred Song;
O let us Exalt the Name of Christ,
to him does Praise belong.
2
A Wonder sure it was,
and that in every part;
Eor while he lay in the Virgins Womb
he lay in her own Heart.
3
That Son the Mother bore,
the Mother did Create;
Both perfect God, and perfect Man,
a Wonder to Relate.
4
Lord Christ, thou art the Priest,
and yet the Sacrifice:
The Altar too art thou likewise,
and Gift that Sanctifies.
5
Thou God-Man, King, and Priest,
Almighty art yet Meek;
Thou art most Just yet Merciful,
the guilty came to seek.
6
Thou never any failed,
that sought thee in their need;
Thou never quenched the smoking Flax,
nor broke the bruised Reed.
7
Thy Life a wonder was;
but here is a wonder more,
That thou that did all Kingdoms make,
should make thy self so Poor.
8
And wonderful it is,
[that we this thing do see,]
That thou, who art all Life and Love,
yet few, alas! Love Thee.

By thy Atonement, Lord, thou have
our Pardon brought about:

Our Surety for us did Die,
O blessed be thy Name!
Let Saints Praise Thee with one accord,
yea, highest Praise proclaim.
5
Sinners, your Pardon ready is,
O fall at Jesus's feet;

That makes thy Saints with joy to run,
and thy sweet Lips to Kiss?
2
How heavy and how dull are they,
(how dead and carnal too;)
Who in the Old Nature do abide,
they nothing freely do.
3
Thy Saints are fired with thy Love,
they in thy ways rejoice;
And upwards they to thee do move,
and sing with cheerful Voice.
4
Thy acceptance, Lord, of us,
thy Love and Favor kind,
Is Wages now enough for us;
this Blessing let us find.

And we will Praise thy Holy Name,
and sing continually;
And of thy Ways never weary be,
until we come to Die.

In Unity, so will we sing
thy Praises, now and ever.

The Fountain's opened,
From whence thy Love and Goodness flows,
And all things we do need:

Let sinners then believe,
And know assuredly,

Their great Iniquity.

And never more Depart.

THy ways, O Lord, most pleasant be,
and all thy Paths are Peace;
The joys of all that cleave to Thee,
shall never, never, cease.
2
What are all sinful Pleasures here,
which are sinners delight?
Will they not hateful all appear
when sin is in their sight?
3
More joy is there in leaving it,
and in Repenting Tears;
Then they do find who it commit,
who filled are with fears.

O Young Men, Young Men, will you then
Christ's gracious Call Obey?

our Lord, who once did Die;

what have thou now to show?
We do to thee present the Blood
that from Christ's sides did flow:
O blessed Wisdom infinite,
it is thou have done the thing;
Justice and Mercy now are joined,
by our most blessed King!
5
But woe to such who slight this Grace,
Salvation to neglect;

because they are set free;
Their Crowns they throw, Lord, at thy feet,
and will give Praise to Thee.

And thy Foot never shall slide!

Saints happy at Death. Sung at the Funeral of Mr. JOHN LOINS, June the 26th.
1692. Who (to the great Grief of his Godly Friends) was accidentally Drowned in
the River of Thames.
1
THe Length of all our Life and Age,
O Lord, is in thy hand;
And we must go when thou do call,
and yield to thy Command.
2
Our days are few, and pass away,
like as a shadow flys;
Let Us ready be, O Lord we pray,
and shun all Vanities.
3
When we go out of our own Doors,
none knows what may befall,
Or come on us, ever we return;
Life's uncertain to all.
4
O call to Mind, remember then,
our Time consumes fast;
Why have thou made the Sons of Men,
as things in vain to waste?
5
What Man is he that Lives here,
and Death shall never see?
Or, from the hand of the dark Grave,
can, Lord, delivered be?
6
But blessed are they, who die in Christ,
their Death to them is Gain,
Their Souls do go to Paradise;
the Wicked go to Pain.
7
Praised be God for Jesus Christ,
who gives such Victory
Unto thy Saints, over Sin and Death;
sing Praise continually.

The Godly ly in a sweet Sleep,
they sleep in Jesus do;
And no more Pain, nor Sorrow shall
for ever undergo.

Some Savoury Souls who do Proclaim
thy Grace, which does abound.
3
But O the want of Salt, O Lord,
how few are Salted well;
How few are like to Salt indeed,
Salt thou thy Israel!
4
Now sing ye Saints who are this Salt,
and let all Seasoned be
With your most Holy Gracious Lives;
great need of it we see.
5
The Earth will else Corrupt and Stink
O Salt it well therefore,
And Live to him that Salted you,
and sing for evermore.

From Christ's sweet Mouth so free,

To whom my Soul does move!

Of Stars till there is none?

And all things else in sight;
Hyperbolize Immensity,
And run to Infinite?
6
This my Beloved is,
He is the total sum
Of all Perfections, and the Bliss
Of all that to him come.

Thou do excel all Men;
Thou fairer art than ten Thousand;
Hallelujah. Amen.

2
Could never produce so sweet a Rose
as I will be to Thee.
So fair a Lilly never grew,
Sharon must stoop to Me.
3
O Blessed Jesus, do thou say,
who will have a Rose so sweet!
Who will refuse our Sharons Rose,
that knows its fragrant scent?
4
Upon the Cross thou was Distilled,
we taste in Distillation,
The sweetness of the absent Rose,
by Faith and Acceptance.
5
Thou art a Rose, my Soul's repose,
O let me never be,
My Dearest Lord, a Thorn to thee,
who art so sweet to me.
6
Thou art the Lilly of the Vale,
a matchless Purity.
And I will sing thy Praise since thou
do in my Bosom ly.
HYMN 93.
Cant. 5. 12. -- His Eyes are like the Eyes of Doves.
1
I Will tell you farther, that if such
A Person you shall see,
Whose Eyes like Doves are washed with Milk
and Water this is he?
2
He has a killing Eye, 'twill Pierce
through Adamantine Ears;
And wound a Rock but with a look,
and melt it into Tears.
3
Eyes that are clear and fitly set,
that can see all things past,
And all things present and to come,
as long as Time shall last:
4
Whose Eyes are Pure, Holy and Chaste,
never defiled with Sin;
That never was in the least Promp't
to take foul Objects in.
If such a One you meet, whose Eyes
like Flames, and Lamps of Fire
Strikes Dead, and yet gives Life thereby,
it is he that I desire?
6
This is the Man I seek, and praise,
All-seeing, and All-Eye:
Tell him, if such a one you meet,
it is for his Love, I Die!

Beautiful on the Mountains: Or, A Ransom found.
1
HOw beautiful upon the Mount,
are they that Peace proclaim,
That unto Rebels offer Grace,
in their great Masters Name.

glad Tidings; and do tell
To Sinners, there is a Ransom found,
to save their Souls from Hell. Mr. D.

3
Who say to Saints, who interest have
in Thee, their dearest Lord,
Thou will them all for ever Save,
such Grace thou do afford:
4
Mount Sinai's fiery Law cannot break
a Heart that is like a stone;
The Creature's Arrows at the Walls
of Brass, in vain are thrown.
5
It Is only Pardon that does melt,
and Love does sinners draw:
We therefore, Lord, will sing thy Praise;
grace does exceed the Law.

thy self, in Faith and Love,

shall also sing above.

And sing Sweet Psalms Triumphantly,
Before him let us bow.

HYMN 100.
A Sacred Hymn on Sanctification.
1
THe Fountain of true Holiness
Jehovah is most high;
His Name it is that we will bless
and Praise continually.
2
Thou perfect art, in Holiness,
thy Glory let us see,
O shine upon us more or less,
and make us all like thee,
3
Amongst the Fruitful Lillies thou
do love Lord Christ to feed,
O let my Soul a Lilly be,
no more a stinking Weed.
4
Until the Glorious Morn shall break,
and shadows flee away,
O let the Glorious Lord be mine,
and I never from him stray!
5
O perfect, Lord, thy handiwork,
begun upon my Heart;
Make up thy Jewels; unto me,
thy Image, Lord, impart!
6
Turn, my Beloved, to my Soul,
be like a pleasant Roe;
And I will sing thy Praises forth,
whilst in thy Paths I go.
7
A glorious Day is coming on,
when all shall sing thy Praise;
It Is Holiness thou will Perfect,
in those longed for Days.
The End of the first Century.
