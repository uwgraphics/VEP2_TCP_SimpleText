THE Lancashire Sham-Plot.
To the Tune of, A. SMITH.
PRojecting and Plotting for the Public Good,
Is now a good Trade if well understood,
As appears in a late Inquisition for Blood,
Which no body can deny. Which, etc.
I have read of a Brewer a great Undertaker,
And of Perjured T. O. that famous Plot-maker,
But he and the Brewer's outdone by a Baker,
Which, etc.
This Baker by some is called honest Harry,
Yet in London some think he will not long tarry,
'Cause something of late in his hands did miscarry,
Which, etc.
His Friend Aaron Smith the Story can tell,
And what bad Misfortune to them both befell
In Manchester Town, which is known very well,
Which, etc.
You cannot but have heard of a damned Horrid Plot,
To bring in the King and the Lord God knows what,
Lately Baked in an Oven, and came out piping hot,
Which, etc.
This Plot was well guarded by Men of Renown,
And safely brought up to be tried here in Town;
But by Judge H -- ts Advice 'twas again carried down,
Which, etc.
For something was whispered to him in his Ear,
That he plainly refused in the Cause to appear,
And that was the Reason it was not tried hear,
Which, etc.
But yet tried it was, and that for good Reason,
Thirty Thousand a Year may be guilty of Treason,
And Plots in this Reign are always in Season,
Which, etc.
To prove this damned Sham one, there is some did Swear purely,
That had it not been for a good honest Jury,
No Man of Estate had been safe I Will assure ye,
Which, etc.
For Honest Men's Fears did daily increase,
(...) use the Witnesses they were all of a Piece,
Who, like Thieves, would kill the poor Sheep for the Fleece,
Which, etc.
But the Innocent Prisoners in their own defense,
Foul horrid Things proved against the King's Evidence,
Which some was committed to Prison for since,
Which, etc.
Such a black piece of Villainy never was detected
Since his Highness P. O. our King was Elected,
But Providence brought both to pass unexpected,
Which, etc.
In short, when the Matter on both sides were heard,
Against Aaron's Tribe such damned things appeared,
That with loud Acclamations the Prisoners were Cleared,
Which, etc.
Yet it will not be amiss to give you a Hint
Of this Cursed Sham-Plot, and what by it was meant,
And of those of great Note that had a hand in it,
Which, etc.
This Serpentine Monster was first hatched in Hell,
And nourished by some that I know very well;
But I dare not speak out, nor all the Truth tell,
Which, etc.
But this I Will affirm, and if need I can Swear
We Have had a Sham-Plot at the least once a Year,
And tell one does take, they will go on still I fear,
Which, etc.
Yet no Man can say but the last was well laid,
And Breerton, Wilson, and Lunt were well paid,
And encouraged with Gold to set up their Trade,
Which, etc.
Whose Trade was to Swear, Cheat, Lie, and Deceive,
All Honest Men Hang, and others Inslave,
And God, Truth and Justice, defy and out brave,
Which, etc.
And being all Artests of their Profession,
In spite to Religion they made this Confession,
That all Men has Right that gets into Possession,
Which, etc.
In order to that the Estates of some Men
Were designed to be Seized, but failing, they then
Swore Treason against 'em, the place where and when,
Which, etc.
But before that was done they met and agreed
To make all the Rank Rich Jacobites bleed,
And Warrants were signed to that purpose with speed,
Which, etc.
Those that were to Act in this mad Bloody Freek,
That they might be perfect and not be to seek,
Did practice their Parts and Rehearse twice a Week,
Which, etc.
At the Sign of the Trencher in Plot Office-Court,
Where Blackhead, Young, Fuller, and Lunt did resort,
A Plot was Trumpt up to make 'em some Sport,
Which, etc.
And then like a Hare, by a Pack of Bloodhounds,
She was hunted and chass'd through Cities and Towns,
Yet she did get off clear without Blood or wounds,
which, etc.
Give the Devil his due they did give her Law,
Not doubting she could ever escape the Tyke's Paw;
But they were all dull whelps, not one worth a straw,
which, etc.
The Curs having lost both the Sight and the Scent
Of the Game they pursued, and being quite spent,
They hung down their Ears all along as they went,
which, etc.
Being quite disappointed of seizing their Prey,
The Hunts-men and Hounds, as I have heard say,
Like the Dutchmen at Landen, did all run away,
which, etc.
Thus happily ended that Bloody Contest,
And by what is hear said you may guess at the rest,
For a Word to the Wise was always thought best,
Which no body can deny. Which, etc.
FINIS.
