TO THE READER.
Dear Friends,
Remembering the good Householder that brought forth out of his Treasury, Things
both New and Old; I am made willing to Communicate this following Salutation,
which was written some Time since, chiefly to my Elder Faithful Brethren and
Sisters: But meeting with various Exercises, in which Time the Enemy was not
wanting to discourage me, I laid it by. But now feeling the Renewings of the
Love of God toward you, and a fresh Stream of Love and Life from the same
Fountain, running in my Soul, and opening my Heart toward my Younger Convinced
Friends, I now after this Salutation to you, commit what follows to their
serious Reading and Consideration; who am, and trust in God, shall Remain in
true Love, your Friend, and their Fellow-Traveller, till I may arrive at my
desired Rest, which is to lay down my Head in Peace with the Lord.

A. F.

A SALUTATION OF TRUE LOVE
TO you my Dear and Well-beloved Friends, Faithful Brethren and Sisters, whom
my Soul feels a Uniting to, in the Spirit of the Living God, which has
quickened and made you a living People, who once were Dead as well as others;
but through the Riches of the Love of God in the Revelation of his Son Christ
Jesus, are made alive to Praise him; whose gathering Arm has been made bare
for our Salvation, and Preservation from under Satan's Thraldom, in which we
were held by his dark Power, which did bear Rule, and Captivate our Minds,
insomuch, that many were Slaves, till the Lord was pleased to reach forth the
Hand of his Divine Love, and make known the Right Arm of his Heavenly Power to
gather us, who with his Shepherds Crook did reach unto us, and found us out; by
which, he has brought many near unto himself, and they are his Elect, and
Precious in his Sight, to whom he has and will Reveal his blessed Mind and
Will; and for whom, he has, and will yet arise to plead with all that shall
Combine against him, or those whom he has called for a Purpose of his own
Glory, by whom he has, and does yet intend through the work of his Spirit, to
show forth his excellent Name, which is as Precious Ointment to them, who
through the Virtue thereof, have smelt the good Savor which many shall yet
greatly desire: For the Lord that has begun a Work of Reformation, will yet go
on to a further perfecting the same in this our Age; and many have been the
Visitations of the Long-suffering God, who has, and will yet come in, and with
the Sanctified, to Judge and Condemn the Unsanctified, and especially those
that have professed his worthy Name, but have lived in that which has
dishonored, and caused it to be Evil spoken of by those who know it not; but
lamentable is their Case, except they Repent and Turn to the Lord with their
whole Hearts, that have been Convinced of the Truth, and in some Measure know
the working of that Power, which is alone sufficient to Convert and work a
Change, as it is yielded to, through the Lively Operation thereof, which works
by Love in the Hearts of all that sincerely desire to be Translated from Death
to Life, that they may be as Living Monuments of the Mercies of God, which to
the Praise of his Name be it spoken, many are.

And these are they to whom the Lord has, and is spreading his Table with many
Delicates, and they know the Mansion House where their Bread is sure, and their
Water never fails; Come Eat with me this day my well beloved, and drink of the
Wine of the Kingdom, for it is new and newly poured forth, through the Flagons
of God's Love to you who are indwellers where his mercy Seat you have beheld,
and where you can approach, before the Throne of his heavenly Grace, and where
his honorable Presence you do behold when the Light of his Countenance is
lifted up upon you: O then, his Love you feel as a strong Cord which draws you
to love him again, and you are the espoused to Christ, who can say, in truth he
is my Beloved, and I am his; you feel his blessing to light upon you, as the
Dew which causes you to grow, and you are as the Garden of God which he
delights to dress and prune, and much Labor has the Lord bestowed on you,
whose love is felt at this time as the small Rain descending on every Plant,
that his Right hand has planted, that they may grow in their Season as the
Summer Fruits which are beautiful to behold. Friends, my Soul is greatly
affected with what the Lord has done* and is doing for a People that are
willing to be the Workmanship of his hands, whose sincere Cry is to the Lord,
not only to know his Will which is the Sanctification of his People, but also
to know the word of his Power, which is as a Hammer and as a fire to beat down
and burn up all the Combustible matter; and you are they that have and are
coming thus to know the Travel of your Souls through an holy Subjection to the
Mind and Will of God, that he will and does stand by, and secretly make way for
through all outward and inward Opposition; but to such who may not be so nearly
gathered, this Exhortation springs from the Root of true Love; Retire to the
Lord and draw near to him who has promised he will draw near to you; and
Christ said, They that come unto me I will in no ways cast off; Blessed be the
Lord there are many witnesses, therefore let all be encouraged, he is faithful
who has promised; many can seal to the Testimony whom he has made partakers
of the Benefit thereof, and they have reapt great Advantage by coming unto him;
yea when they were wearied and heavy laden with diverse sins, then was his hand
stretched out to undo the heavy Burden, and that was a sign of Love, the
remembrance of which bows my Soul before the great God, whose Love I feel, and
the large extending thereof, reaching to all, and many shall be visited who
have not yet felt God's quickening Power, to raise their Souls from that Sleep
of Death, which Satan has lulled them into through harkning unto him, and
disobeying the Command of the great God; but my Friends, I know the dealing of
the Lord to you, who are awakened and raised from Death to Life is as a strong
Obligation on your Spirits to walk in the Light of the Lord, where the Morning
of God's Day was known to dawn, and the Sun to rise, that has shined unto the
Noon* day, by which your hearts have been warmed, and your Spirits sweetly
comforted, in the sense of which my Soul does bless the Lord, that he has
opened mine Eyes to behold the appearance of this day, in which the glorious
Splendor and Beams of the Sun of Righteousness has so greatly shined, and
shall yet to many who yet set under the Region and shadow of Death;
notwithstanding the secret and open workings of the Enemy of man's Soul, whose
work is to darken the Mind, and bring a Cloud as a Veil over the Understandings
of People, that they may not see the Light of the glorious Gospel, that has
and shall shine through them, who faithfully walk in the Light of this
everlasting day in which the Sun shall never set; for as the Lord has been at
work, so he will work, and none shall be able to hinder his determined Will,
which is to exalt his Son; who said of himself, I am the Way, the Truth, the
Life and the Light; he also said, he that believes in me shall not abide in
darkness, but shall have the Light of Life; and you are they that do witness
the Truth of that saying, whom the Lord has made partaker of such like
precious Faith, which he has bestowed upon you, and it is not in vain must my
Soul with yours acknowledge being made a partaker in some degree of the saving
Virtue that is in it, to the Praise of the Lord's worthy Name, be it spoken,
who has bestowed it on us, for my heart is filled, and with the abounding
thereof does my Cup overflow, and run as a Salutation to you my well beloved
Friends, faithful Brethren and Sisters, in that relation which the Spirit of
God has brought us into through the indwelling Power thereof; even all you
that were born of that Royal Seed which is the Off spring of David, to you the
Root of Jesse is sprung up in this our day: High praises to the Honorable
worthy Name of the great God, I know is given by all you who do know the
branches of it overspreading the Earth in your hearts; you are of that Number
of whom it was spoken, they that touch the Elect, touch the Apple of God's Eye,
what can be nearer or sooner felt? O the Love of God as the Bowels of a tender
Father, you have known to succor and relieve, to save and deliver; he is the
same this day as ever, and changes not: I know you have had large Experience,
even you that have walked the heavenly Progress, and run in the Race with
Patience which was set before you, and are coming toward an End of your
Travels, which has been through many Difficulties, for many Troubles have been
the Portion of of the Righteous; may I not say as on your behalf, whom the Lord
did call in the breaking forth of this glorious Day, the Light of which now
shines in the hearts of many, to whom you have been publishers to proclaim the
sound of the Everlasting Gospel, to which the Ears of many have been opened,
and their hearts ready to receive the glad Tidings of Peace, for which my Soul
is greatly engaged to bless the Lord, that I was one of that Number to which
the sound has reached: Therefore dear Friends for a farther Confirmation,
believing you have had many, that your faithful Labors and Travels in the Work
of the Gospel of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, has not been in vain; for
I am obliged to acknowledge to the benefit, that I with many more whom I know,
have with me been made partakers of the same consolating, refreshing,
strengthening Virtue which the Lord has through you communicated unto us, who
as good Stewards of the manifold Grace of God have distributed to the poor in
Spirit; who through believing and receiving the Grace of God are made rich in
Faith, and Heirs of that Kingdom that shall never have an End: O the Joy of
God's Salvation, the Comfort and Consolation you know who have traveled
through, and are gone before by the Assistance of the heavenly Power, and
blessed Spirit of the living God, which is one in all the faithful, who truly
come to know their Minds and Wills rightly subjected to it, and that come to be
led and guided by it; such know the Efficacy and Virtue of it, to lead and
guide them into Truth, and from all Untruth, and such are they that adorn the
Gospel, and these alone are Preachers of Truth and Righteousness, who are
taught and learned of him, who never guile was found in his Mouth. O the
Righteous holy Principle of Life, what a Beauty does mine Eyes behold in it,
how comely are you who have kept your first Love to it, and have not made
shipwreck of Faith, but have this day the Answer of a good Conscience toward
God and all Men! Friends, the sense of your everlasting Joy and endless
Felicity, when the Lord shall remove you out of these earthly Tabernacles and
Houses of Clay, begets a fervent desire in me, that we who are as the younger
begotten, but brought forth by the same Arm and mighty Power of God, and have
hitherto been brought up, and nourished by the same Milk of the Word, may grow
thereby from strength to strength, till we come to the Stature and fullness of a
Man in Christ, and that the hindermost of the Flock may come up, and follow in
the Footsteps of you that are gone before in that straight and narrow Way
which leads to Life, that hereby we may come to be enriched with the same
heavenly Treasure; and though younger begotten yet as right Heirs may come to
have a part and share in that Joy, which is unspeakable, and full of Glory: Now
my honorable esteemed Fathers, and Elders, faithful Brethren and Sisters in
that Life, that shall outlive Death, and the Power of it; and in true Love do I
salute you all whom the Lord has called, and made choice of to promote Truth,
and Righteousness in the Earth; though many are your Gainsayers, the Truth is
that which the Lord will secretly make way for through all Opposition: Blessed
and magnified over and through all be his Almighty Power, which is at work this
day for the furtherance of it; for which Cause the faithful have great Cause to
be encouraged to go on, in the strength of the Lord, who will turn and overturn
till he come to Reign, whose Right it is, in the Hearts of the Children of Men,

From a younger Sister, but one that desires to be a faithful Follower of the
Flock of God, A. F.

A Visitation of Tender Love, as I felt it Running in a fresh Stream of Life to
you my Friends, who are younger convinced in and about London.
DEar Friends, Brethren and Sisters, whom I love in the Lord; and desire well
for, as for my own Soul, that you may all grow in Grace, and in the Knowledge
of God; whom to rightly know is Life Eternal; the Testimony of which, has been
often sounded in your Ears through many worthy Ancients, whom the Lord by his
immediate Power has fitted for the Publishing his Truth, and Informing you of
the blessed Way of Life and Salvation in this our Age: Blessed be his Name, his
Fame has spread, and shall to the Ends of the Earth; He is the same God this
Day, as ever, his Power is not lessened, neither is his Arm shortened, but his
Voice is still uttered, and his Call is, Come look unto me all ye Ends of the
Earth, and be ye saved, who saves his People from Sin, that they may be Workers
of Righteousness; He says, I am God, and there is no other; He is a jealous
God, and jealous of his Glory; therefore see to it all you who have heard his
Call, which I doubt not but many must acknowledge too; therefore this is with
me in the Love of God, to you who have heard, but not yet obeyed the Call of
the Lord, which is, Come and be saved; a worthy Call indeed, and worthy of all
Acceptance for your Encouragement, that thereby you may come to forsake and
deny those things which the Call has been to you, to come out of, or depart
from either, immediately, by his Spirit in your Hearts, or Instrumentally,
through any faithful Servant, by the Conducts of it; for his Call has gone
long forth, and his Alarming Trumpet has been long sounded, and is this Day;
Arise thou that sleep, and come to Judgment; for SION must be Redeemed
through Judgment, and all her Converts, with and by that Righteous Principle of
Light and Life, by and through which, the Spirit of God's Love and Free Grace
has been, and yet is so largely Extended to and amongst you, that now you may
not only hear, but believe and obey the Gospel of our Lord, and come to know
him to be your Savior, and to have your Spiritual Eyes so opened, as to behold
your Teacher, which you have often heard, cannot be removed into a Corner; for
that is the good End of the Lord, in visiting you who have had a large Day in
this City; therefore, now that you may come to know the Work of Salvation, by a
thorough Separation from all that which draws the Mind into Vanity from God,
that thereby you may be the saved of the Lord, and of that number which may
come to Mount SION with Songs of Deliverance, and enter into that Joy which all
the faithful (who hide not their Talent in that Earthly Mind, which leads to a
Carnal Liberty and Fleshly Ease,) shall enter into; therefore, whilst the Day
of God's tender Visitation, in the Riches of his long forbearing Love does
last, and whilst he is yet striving by his Spirit, harken and give Ear what the
Spirit says, which has and does say, Come, and all that will come may come;
therefore, what Excuses will any make, who have had so much, or many
Invitations of the Love of God? who has also said, My Spirit shall not always
strive with Man: Therefore, let none harden their Hearts, or stiffen their
Necks against the Way of the Lord, which is as sure this Day, as ever, as
Righteous and Holy, as ever, and they that walk in it, must deny themselves of
all the contrary, as much as ever; and blessed be the Lord, this is not the Day
in which the Lord will say to such, My People perish for want of Knowledge;
therefore, let all take heed of the greater Condemnation: He that knows his
Masters Will, and does it not, shall be beaten with many Stripes.

Dear Friends, In the tendering begetting Love of our God, is my Heart opened
to you who are the Younger convinced amongst us, for whom my Spirit, with many
more, has been, and is truly concerned with many Desires to the Lord on your
behalf, that as you have heard the Truth, and been Educated in the Truth, you
may also receive the Truth in the Love of it, and come to be led and guided by
it, into the Self denying Way of it, to take up the Cross, and bear the Yoke in
your Youth, that thereby you may come to wear the Crown of Faithfulness in your
Riper Years: For it is the same this Day as ever. If you die not the Death of
the Righteous, you cannot expect to be made Heirs of Everlasting Life;
therefore it behooves all to be concerned, and consider what Spirit they are
sowing to; if to the Flesh and carnal Desires, of that you will certainly reap
Corruption; but if to the Spirit, Life Everlasting; for to be spiritually
minded is Life and Peace: Blessed be the Lord, there are many Witnesses of it,
and now that there may be many more of those who have heard it born Witness to;
for the Lord has caused many to rise early, and go forth late to Preach the
Everlasting Gospel amongst you, which is glad Tidings of Peace to all that
believe and obey the Gospel; but to such who do not obey, what Tidings does it
bring to your Houses? O! Harken and again hear what the Spirit says, you have
been often directed to it, and it is the Inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God
must give you a right Understanding of these things that differ from it,
whatever you may hear by those who have had large Experience of the Way and
Work of the Lord, which will be your great Condemnation if you walk not in it;
but blessed be the Lord, there is a living Hope in that Faith which stands in
the Power of God, that many will yet be awakened unto Righteousness, and
stirred up to walk in that blessed Way and Path of the Just, which is a shining
Light, and will shine in them more and more, till the perfect Day; for the Sun
of Righteousness is risen, and his splendorous Beams are seen, yea, many have,
and yet shall behold the Glory and Beauty that is in him, and be made Partakers
of that healing Virtue which proceeds from him; therefore, all press forward
through the Throng of all that which you find to oppose in your Hearts, that by
Faith you may come to touch the Hem of his Garment, by which the Precious
Virtue of his Life you may know conveyed to your immortal Souls. Dear Friends,
the Lord is on his way, therefore be ye followers of him; why should any stay
behind, and miss such great Salvation as is offered in this our Day? Friends,
be concerned and seek the Lord, that you may be found of him, and find find him
to be your exceeding great Reward, for he is a rewarder of all them that
diligently seek after him, and blessed be the Lord there is a Remnant that have
sought, but not in vain; yea, many faithful and living Testimonies have you
heard of the same, therefore is my Heart still in the Love of God drawn to
remind you, that you come to be experimental Witnesses; the Lord many of you
know, and the Truth you know, therefore travel on and go forward in the
Footsteps of the Flock of God who are gone before, and many are entered into
that Holy City, the Gates of which stand open to receive all who are truly poor
in spirit, for they shall inherit the Kingdom of Heaven,

Which is a Place of great Felicity.
Believe it you, and then come all and see,
Where Joy and Comfort endless does abound,
To all unfeigned hearts whose Love is sound;
And travel on as Caleb, Joshua did,
Men of excellent Spirits, as you all may read.
And this I also do you farther tell,
There is great Happiness in doing well.
The benefit of which you will surely find,
If cross you do all vain things in your mind;
The Principle of Light and Truth is set
In thy Heart, Man, and does it often check.
But this is a great Misery in our day;
Some hate Counsel, and thrust Truths check away.
But I desire that none of you so do,
To whom these following Lines do yet ensue.
You who are the Children and Offspring, yea, I may say, the natural Branches
of such who have been grafted into the true Vine; to many of you the Love of
God still reaches, that you may come to know a being grafted in also, and that
you may receive Sap and Nourishment from the Root Christ Jesus, that thereby
you may come to grow fresh and green, remembering the Willows by the
Watercourse, you having been often watered as with the Dew from Heaven, that
now you may not be as fruitless Branches, that the Lord may not have cause to
cut off any natural Branch; but as you are Children, and Heirs of these Earthly
things, which the Lord has blessed many of your Parents with; that now you may
not only therewith be content, but fervently desire to be made Heirs, and
Possessors of that heavenly Treasure, and durable Riches which the Lord has
also enriched them with, that you may not be only Children of the Flesh, but
come to know a being born of the Spirit, or that spiritual Birth brought forth
in you, which is Heir of everlasting Life; that when your Parents shall be
called to leave these earthly Tabernacles, or Houses of Clay, to possess an
House not made with hands but Eternal in the Heavens, which many are already
called to then, as you come to possess and enjoy their Substance; here you may
also be following them in that straight and narrow way, which will lead and
bring you to that same purchased Possession, and everlasting Inheritance when
Time in this World shall be no more; that as the Lord has been honored, his
Power magnified, and Truth exalted by many who have been as a kind of first
Fruits, to the Praise of the Lord be it spoken, that now you who are as a
following Generation, may be as a second Spring on the same Ground, whose
freshness and greenness may so appear, as that you may be Inviters and
Encouragers of others to come and feed on the same Pasture; the Lord being your
Shepherd, you may be able to say, we shall not want, having your Faith in him,
and Hearts fixed upon him, that in all things your Eyes may be to him, and to
the Honor of his great Name, which has been as precious Ointment often poured
forth amongst you; the Savor of which has caused many to love the Lord, and
not only to love him, but an increase of Love to him has been known, and this
is that Love which thinks no Evil; the Lord still increase it; this bears all
things, endures and suffers all things; this Love also edifies and will build
you up as an holy House, as you see the Increase of it; this is that Love which
the Apostle makes mention of, when he said, All things are as Dross and Dung in
comparison of the Riches of the Love of God, which has been revealed and
partaken of in this our Day, through Christ Jesus our Lord: And now Dear
Friends; my desire to the Lord on your behalf, is, that you may have the
Benefit of those precious Promises; which are Yea, and Amen, unto the one Seed
Christ Jesus, which will be as you find him raising that Birth in you, which
hungers and thirsts after Righteousness: For such the Lord has, and will fill
with the Treasure of Wisdom, and they shall know the Mysteries of his Kingdom,
and be fed with that Bread which comes down from Heaven; and here you will feed
together as harmless Sheep of one Pasture, and be nourished up in that innocent
Life in which the Plant will grow, that the Lord's Right hand has planted; and
here you will not only answer the good End of the Lord, but also the Care of
your tender Parents; which has not only been concerned for you their Children,
but also for the Honor of God and the Glory of his Power, which I have often
heard many publicly desire, that this young Generation may come to witness the
operating Virtue of it, to soften, tender, and mollify their Heart; that by
the effectual working thereof, they may know that Contrition of Spirit, which
the Lord never did, nor will despise: Friends, slight not the Love of God,
because you have often and many frequent Tokens of it, but embrace it, and
remember it is said, Whilst it is called to Day, harden not your Hearts, lest a
Night of Deprivation of these Mercies you now enjoy, should approach any of
you; Dear Friends, the Love of God enlarges my Heart to you, the which I desire
you may feel, to make room in you to receive; it will be your own Advantage,
and a Cause of Joy and Comfort, to those whom the Lord has made instrumental
in his hand, to the begetting of you to himself, and here you will be in a
living Capacity, to glorify God your Maker; and much might be said for your
Encouragement, but the Lord will not be wanting unto you, for his immediate
Power will be present with you; as also many Instruments in his hand, whom he
has, and may make helpful to you: And thus dear Friends, the God of all our
Mercies will be honored, the Knowledge of his Truth still increased, and we
together mutually comforted, which is the hearty Desire of your Friend and
Sister,

ABIGAL FISHER.

FINIS.
