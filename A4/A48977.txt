May 11. 1644.
THE Committee of the Militia of the City of London, and parts adjacent, within
the Lines of Communication, and Parishes within the weekly Bills of Mortality,
having taken knowledge that many persons within the Limits aforesaid (out of a
pious zeal and good affection to the Public Cause) have of late freely and
voluntarily subscribed diverse sums of money, toward the maintaining of
Forces to be sent forth by the said Committee, in pursuit of the late
success Almighty God has given us against our Enemies) have thought fit for
the better promoting of so good a work, to direct the further recommendation
thereof to the Minister, and Churchwardens of the several Parishes within the
Limits aforesaid, effectually to move and incite all persons interessed in this
Cause, cheerfully and freely to subscribe in some good measure, toward the
maintenance of the said Forces, which in pursuit of the Enemy, may (by Gods
blessing) put a happy end unto this unnatural War, now raging within this
Kingdom.

And the said Committee do earnestly desire and require you respectively
forthwith to examine diligently what Subscriptions of money have already been
made by any person or persons within your said Parish, for the purpose
aforesaid; and effectually to move all others (that have not as yet done any
thing in this behalf) freely to subscribe in some considerable manner toward
this most necessary Service; and to let such well-affected persons know, as
shall forthwith advance and pay unto the Treasurers for Money and Plate at the
Guild Hall any sums of money for the purpose aforesaid; that for their
encouragement they shall have the security expressed in an Ordinance of
Parliament, made the third of April last; by which it is ordained that all
such moneys so advanced and lent as aforesaid, and paid to the said Treasurers;
shall be employed only to maintain the said forces, and not otherwise; and
shall be repaid with interest after the rate of eight pounds per. centum, out
of the Receipts of the Excise and New-Impost, granted by a late Ordinance of
Parliament: That is to say, the first half years Interest at six months
after the Loan of the said moneys, and the last half years Interest,
together with the principal, at the end of the next six months following. And
also to let such Parishes know, as shall desire rather to lend their Money for
this Cause; to be repaid upon the Public Faith; and to choose Collectors and
Treasurers among themselves to receive and issue out the same to any of the
said Forces, according to the direction of the said Committee of the Militia,
that the said Committee upon knowledge thereof, will forthwith indeavonr to
procure an Ordinance of Parliament for the same purpose.

And the said Committee do further desire you to certify them in writing under
your hands, upon Wednesday next, the names and sirnames of all such within your
Parish, as have subscribed to this most necessary work, together with the
sums of Money, underwritten by them, As also the names and sirnames of all
such persons of ability within the said Parish, that shall refuse to subscribe
for the use and purpose aforesaid.

Dated this (...)th of May, 1644. I (...)d Committee.
