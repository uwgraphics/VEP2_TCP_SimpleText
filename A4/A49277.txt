LAte in the morning as I abroad was walking,
All in a Meadow green, I heard two Lovers talking
With kisses sweet the young man her Saluted,
Then I drew near to hear what they disputed:
Then I drew near to hear what they disputed.
Young Man. Fair Maid, quoth he, this merry morning,
Present one smile to me, and be no longer ^ro^ni^g,
Him who has vowed to be thine own ^or^ve^,
O say but to me, Our Loves shall never s^^^^
O say but to me, etc.

Maid Indeed Sir, quoth she, it is a misty morning,
But I would have you to know I always h^^^d ^^orn^ng,
And as for love, as yet I mean to smother,
I know not one as yet I love better than another
I know not one, etc.

Young Man. True love, sweetheart, quoth. he, if e're you chance to know it,
It cannot smothered be, but at last you will show it;
The first time I beheld thy sweet and comely carriage,
I ever since desired that we were joined in marriage:
I ever since desired, etc.

Maid. Love Sir, quoth she, is like a Fishers Angle,
Which often has golden baits silly Maidens so entangle,
Are cunningly cast out by young men's less inventions,
Then marriage they will pretend where it is not their intentions,
then marriage they will pretend, etc.

Young Man. O it is so, my Dear, true love is like a fountain
That casts out water clear out of a Rocky Mountain,
Whose stream for to stop you will say it is a wonder,
Likewise it is as strange to cleave the Rocks in sunder:

Young Man. Fie, fie, Sweetheart, your wi^deth over-ma^ch me,
No words I can impart but presently you catch me:
You Maidens now each day do grow so (...) and witty,
Let young men beg and pra^ ^ou'll take of them (...) try.
Let young men beg, etc.

Maid Fie, away for shame^ you young men can dissemble,
Your wits are ripe, your tongues are qu^ck and nimble,
Indeed you will beg and pray sometimes to (...) your pleasure,
Then leave us in the lurch, and we may repent at (...):
then leave us in the lurch, etc.

Young Man. Confessed it is, there is many are so minded,
Bue if thou would prove my Constancy thou wilt find it,
Do thou but command, through danger I will enter,
And for to gain thy love, through an army I would venter^
And for to gain thy love, etc.

She ^^uck the (...) of May in Time, and did pre^ent it
Unto this (...) which was soon discontented;
Here Sir, quoth (...) that you will be eased,
Read but this Riddle, Sir, perhaps you may be pleased.
Read but, etc.

^^^^g-man. He (...) it from ^er ^and and deceived it as a token^
The^ in a dump did st^^d^ ^ never a word was spoken;
Blus^ing, then at last (...) modestly repired,

He took her by ^he ha^^ and lovingly they walked,
But tied in Cupids bands most amorously they talked,
Then on each other (...) with interchanging kisses,
O it is pity time beguiled such Lovers o^ their blisses.
O it is pity, etc.
Perhaps, sweet Sir, you by this Riddle reading^
May think you ga^ned me b^ little or no persuading,
Which if you did, it is yet a^ my pleasure,
I am not bound to you yet, but you must stay my leisure.
I am not, etc.
Then let this heart within this he c^st lies panting,
No happiness e're see, but let (...) be ever wanting,
If e're I think an Evil thought upon thee,
Let mirth be banished quite, and sorrow wait upon me.

(...), quoth she, thou bear such true affection^
(...) I Will agree to be ruled by thy direction;
(...) shall sever or break our loves asunder,
For loyal loving hearts will be the worlds wonder.

All that I have is thine, then rest thy self contented,
Thy (...) wit, thy Modesty and Carriage,
Has won my heart, we will be joined in marriage.

Young Man. He took her at her word, and modestly replied,
Short time I will afford, long time shall be denied;
This being the first of May, our hearts being joined and wedded
Before the fifth day in wedlock we'll be bedded.

Nine hundred pound with this maiden he obtained,
On marriage day was paid, which by his wit he gained;
Although no means he had, she never a whit repented,
He was a gallant Lad, and she was well contented.
he was, etc.
Now all you prity Maids that live in Town or City,
The Author you persuades to learn from this his ditty,
If a young man you love, look not then for his treasure,
For if he honest prove in him is wealth and pleasure:
for if, etc.
You Young Men I Will persuade to hear my motion,
For if you affect a maid, regard not then her portion;
Hang ten pounds, give me the Lass that loves me,
If a good wife thou'st found, no Joy on Earth's above thee
if a good, etc.
Young Men and maids that lately went a Maying,
Mack the Nightingale, one tune he is always playing,
Iug, jug, jug, sweet, is all the note she sings,
As when loyal Lovers meet, no double tongues they bring e^^
as when, etc.
All you pretty Maids that are civil in your carriage,
This Song is sent to you to be wary in your marriage
Try before you trust, be careful in consenting,
That when the knot is tied, there may be no repenting
that when the knot is tied, there may be no repenting.
