THE STATIONER TO THE READER.
Courteous Reader!

BE pleased to take notice, that this Loyal Treatise was penned many years ago,
and sent over from the Hague to be Printed here, for his Majesty's service; but
was hindered hitherto upon this occasion. The Printer, to whose care it was
commended, fell into some trouble, for some Acts of Loyalty, which were then
called Treason; such as were the Printing the late King's incomparable Book,
entitled IKN ASILIKH, in English, Latin, French and Italick: Salmasii Defensio
Regia: Elenchus Motuum nuperorum in Anglia, by Dr. Bates; and some other things
of the like nature; He was committed to Newgate; his Press and other Materials
seized upon and carried away by Hunscott; his Wife and six Children turned out
of doors; and threatened to be tried by an high Court of In-justice. Under which
time of Tyranny and Persequution this Notable (...), arraigning and condemning
the Traitorous and Rebellious actions of bloody-minded men, has been forced
silently to keep within doors. But since God, in his infinite mercy to this
languishing Nation, has been pleased to dispell these black clouds, and to
restore the sunshine of his favor by the glorious presence of his Gracious
Majesty, I presume it may boldly com abroad, and tell these Miscreants to their
faces, their horrid wickedness in the barbarous Murder of the most pious Prince
that ever swayed the English Scepter, their designing the destruction of Church
and State, and sacrificing both to their own lusts of Ambition and
Covetousness, the Original (as of all, so) of this cursed Rebellion against
their lawful Sovereign.

But I shall no longer detein thee in the Porch, be pleased to walk into the
House, which ^ill entertain thee (...) to thy Desire.



CROMWELL's Bloody Slaughterhouse Discovered.
HAve you killed our King, and also taken possession of his Goods Lands and
Kingdoms? O ye bloodthirsty and deceitful men! Is this your Sion, that must be
built with Royal blood, and your Jerusalem, that must be raised with such
detestabl^ iniquity? O ye painted Sepulchers, w^ll no bones serve to fill you,
but those of your King?

You ravening Wolves, (whom God has suffered to uncase your selves of your
Sheeps Clothing) can nothing satiate your cruel Appetites and Hydropick thirst,
but only the flesh and blood of our King? whom with merciless hands and
hearts, in an impudent Triumph you have murdered before the face of God and
his Subjects; whose Royal Posterities, and peoples Lives and Estates you now
hope to devour without any opposition or gainsaying. (So cruelly heavy and
barbarous is that Iron Scepter, with which you think to rule this Nation; not
allowing any fair and legal plea for either Kings or p^oples Lives, Liberties,
Estates or Religion: but beyond all Papal and Mahume^ane Tyranny you usurp
over our Souls, no less than our bodies; and seek (now) by slavish fears, and
sinful agreements to make us all as much the Children of the Devil as your
selves: whose Consciences (no doubt) like ^ai^'s tell you, your desperate and
damnable Estate: having sinned against the light of God, and his holy Spirit,
(some of you) so impudently and maliciously, as justly excludes all hope of
pity or pardon from God and Man: having first treacherously betrayed, then
barbarously murdered, both your and our King.

Go on you Apollions, you Abaddons, in the Spirit of Antichrist, to fill up
the measure of your Abominations, till you are drunk with blood, and stumble
and fall together: O you Locusts, the black^st smoke, and noysomest vapor that
ever the breath of the bottomless pit exhaled or sent forth into the Christian
worl^, your Maiden faces, in your first seemingly modest and fair pretentions
to the King and Kingdom, have now brought on the poisonous Scorpions of your
Tails, after many cunning windings of flattery, perjury and hypocrisi^.

B^hold the fruits of your Oaths, Prayers, Fastings, your Illuminations,
Raptures, and the Sacred madnesses of your Prophets; are they not as the Gr^pes
of Sodom, sour and unsavory, setting on edge the teeth of all men that have
any taste or relish of true piety?

Are these the practices of Saints of spiritual and seraphick minds; of men
living in God and in Christ by the Spirit? We call Heav^n and E^r^h, and your
selves (who are to us as Hell and Devils) to witness against you; What can
the most carnal, loose and profane A^^^ists do^ more abominable, then you
have done? What have the fal^est Jews, the fierc^st Turks, the most brutish
Heathens, the Renegado Chr^stians, the s^bt^lest Jesuits, or the m^st Fanatic
Anabaptists, and Sc^^^maticks, or any other, that are wholly without God in
this world, ever done comparable to your immense Villainies? Yea what could
Devils do more, if they had t^eir w^lls, bu^ by such Instruments as you are,
extend their malice to the utmost latitude of their power?

Have you not by Treachery and Tyranny usurped upon all just power, and exalted
your selves (such despicable worms) above a^l that is cal^e^ God? Neither King,
nor Parliament, nor Laws, nor your own Engagemen^s to all, nor your many
Proposals, Promises and D^clarations have any rever^nce with you, or we^ght
upon you^ but like riotou^ and enrag^d Beasts, you have overborn and trampled
under your feet all that is either Sacred or Civil; in the Laws of God,
Nature, Nation^, or this Kingdom, of which you are Members, though the most
ulcerous and pestilent that ever the Earth can bring forth, or bear.

Happily your stupid pride and bruit^sh insolency will not suffer you to consider
how odious, abominable and accursed you now are to all men, but such as are
Cockatrices of the same Egg and brood with your selves; that is, seared
Saints, honest Hypocrites, and Enlightened Satan's.

We assure you, you are now looked upon by all sober and honest minds, as the
heaviest and filthyest Incubus's that ever oppressed Church or State; as the
Legions of unclean spirits, which by Diabolical Arts and Magic of Hypocrisy,
have got possession of this Church and Kingdom, (till Christ by his power cast
you out of, and suffer you like the Demoniack swine, through the just judgment
of God to be hurried headlong by your own terrors and despairs into the Lake
that burns with fire and brimstone.

You are l^ke cursed Cams, not mockers only, but murderers of the Father of
your Country; impudent Ravishers both of Church and State, to satisfy your
most abominable lusts of Tyranny, Covetousness, and all licentious
profaneness.

Monsters of men, putid Apostates, execrable Saints, shameless sinners,
traiterous Tyrants, what have you to plead for, or palliate with, your late
horrid outrages and unparalled villainies, by which you have obstructed the
Fountain of Justice, altered the Channel, broken the Cistern, turned the clear
and wholesome waters of our Laws into blood, Wormwood, and deadly poison; while
you have with unheard of tyranny and treachery, set up your p ivate wills, by
that publ ke power (wherewith you were in^^usted only for some limited uses)
above the Majesty and lives of our K ng and his Ch^ldren; above the Dignity of
our Parliaments, the honor of our Laws, the reverence of your C^untrey, and
the regard due to your fellow Subjects, and Con^ederate Nations; and all this
without the least color of any call or Authority from God or Man; Reason or
Religion, against all Obligations both Sacred and Civil, that might possibly
lie on men's souls to God or man, against many your particular pretentions and
former p^om^ses of such due observance as became you^ both as Men, Subjects,
Soldiers and Christians.

You who are not the thousand part of his M^jesties Subject, how durst you
knowingly act as in the name of all, and yet indeed against the duty, desi^es
and consciences of all, but such children of Belial as your selves.

You that are for the most part such sons of the Earth of so base extraction,
of meaner education, strang^rs to all good Literature, Honor, or Civility;
heirs of beggary and contempt; whom most of the Subjects in England might for
your rudeness and b^rbarity justly have disdain^d to have set with the Dogs of
their Flocks: How are you become the Creators of a new Heaven, and a new Earth,
who are such sons of Tohu and Bohu, of Chaos, obscurity and confusion?

You that at best are but Gods Bu^chers, the unjust Ex^cutioners of his just
vengeance; as the evil and destroying Angels sent among us for a time; (though
your exorbita^^ malice and lusts disdain to be limited by your Military
Commission, yet God, we hope, will restrain your fury who has manifested your
impious folly.) With what forehead could you thus lift up your hand against,
and set your selves above all those who are confessed your betters, masters and
superiors: As if in a Giantly impuden^^ ^^d Cyclop^ck cruelty you could never
be famous enough but by Infamy; nor fierce and wick^^ enough, unless you
^ought against Heaven, against the express word of God, and his Vicegerents on
earth. Thus heaping up mountains of lies, perjuries, hypocrisies and cru^l^ies,
upon those vast and enormous lusts of rapine, sacrilege, covetousness, rev^nge
and tyranny in your hea^^s, which nothing has ^v^r equalled or can exceed.

You have indeed finished the Masterpiece of your Father the Devil, whom as
his firstborn he has filled with a double portion of malice, subtilty and
cruelty beyond any, whose hearts like Elymas the Sorcerer, or Simon Magus he
has possessed. You have nothing left you but Impenitence and Hell, (which you
neither believe nor fear) by which to make farther progress in your most
flagitious and ever accursed Villainies.

What step have you more to advance to the blaspheming of the Majesty of the
most high God, both in himself and his Deputies, lawful Kings and Sovereign
Magistrates? what more can you do or invent to the scandal of the Gospel, to
the exposing the Name of Christ to open shame, to the trampling his blood under
feet, through the hat^ed and de^estation of all Nations, that are without the
Church? How could you devise more to adorn the Triumphs of Pope and Pap^sts? to
whose tayls you are tied, though your fac^s seem contrary: and whose b^si^esse
you have done, while you pretend to abhor their Names, as much as D^vils do
pot^n^ Ch^rms.

What Sea could ever wash away from the face of the Christian Reformed
Religion, the stain of that blood of our King, which you have (in a Page^nt o^
Justice) most unjustly, inhumanely and barbarously ^hed, to color your malice,
to sa^iate your revenge and to make way for your tyranny, if we the people of
England should b^ our silence adopt, and by our assistance nourish those
prod^gies of Rebellion, Treason and Confusion, which your libidi^ous Mars, by
the h^lp of your p osti^ute and officious Venus, your Unparliamentary Junto
has lately brought forth and astonished the world withal. Was it ever so
done, since the Name of Christ was planted on the earth, save only by the spawn
of those furies, from whom you are descended, who made such havoc first in
Africa, after in other Western Churches, and lately in Germany? whose
principles and practices you have as much surpassed, in Hypocrisic, Anarchy,
cruelty, and blasphemy, as B^elzebub (your Prince) may be thought to exceed the
lesser fry of damned Sp^rits.

Those impure Catharists exercised (indeed) their Donat^sticall and
Anabaptisticall frauds and furi^s, chiefly upon the vulgar, to the ruin of
many thous^n^s of the Coun^rey people and Citizens; But you like so many
Ravilliacks, are not content to have spoiled so many Noble and flourishing
Families, to have exhausted so many plentiful Estates, to have made so many
mourning Widows, and Fatherless Children, to have destroyed the lives, and
sucked the blood of so many Christians, your fellowSubjects, but you must in
one day swallow up the two Houses of Parliament, in another murder the King,
in a third cut off the right and inheritance of the Crown from the Undoubted
Heir, and all the Kings Children. At last you conspire to tempt us all by your
simple and foolish Paperfalsly called, The Agreement of the people, to join
with you in the utter overthrowing of our Laws, Liberties, and the whole frame
of this ancient and renowned Kingdom, whose weight you will find too heavy
for such weak Atlasses as you will shortly appear, both in Counsel and in
Power, who are only wise to doc wickedly, and strong to shed or drink the blood
of your King and Contrymen. Your cruelty has fulfilled the wish of
Caligula, at one blow to cut off the head of three Kingdoms, and with him all
M^narchy; to make way for your Lole^ocracy, a Military Tyranny, or
Schismatichal Anarchy.

Thus have you been profound to deceive, skillful to destroy; our souls ^aint
within us, because of such treacherous dealers, such hideous Murderers, into
whose snares the breath of our nostrils is fallen, and in whose deep
dissembling pits the Anointed of the Lord, our meek patient and most Christian
King is swallowed up; under the shadow of whose just Authority, Princely
wisdom, and judicious piety w^ hoped to have been safe.

How does this sometime famous and flourishing Kingdom, now sit as a Widow,
oppressed, desolate, ^espised; full of unexpressible lamentations^ The
bitterness and gall of your cruel Hypocrisy has entered into, filled and
overwhelmed our souls.

How is she that was the joy, Crown and Queen of all Nations, the Envy or
Emulation of all Christian Churches, now become the horror and astonishment of
her Neighbors round about, the pity and calamity of all her friends, the
^corn, reproach, hissing and triumph of all her Enemies? Nor is there any
helper, comforter, or Deliverer left, till God take the matter into his own
hands, and pl^ad the cause of the King and Kingdom against these proud
Goliahs, whose uncircumcised hearts and lips, out of a ^iot and supe^fluity of
wickedness, have blasphemed our God, destroyed our King, laid waste and
exhausted the Ki^gdome, and turned this Church into a Den of Thieves.

O Lord arise, O Lord consider, O Lord hear the v^yce of our sig^s, tears and
prayers; let the cry of the blood of ^ur King and our people come up to Heaven;
have mercy on us for we are brought very low.

Our gracious King, the Husband of the Kingdom, the Father of his Subjects,
the preserver of our Laws, the Patron of Religion, the Protector of the Church,
you have treacherously and barbarously murdered; the two Houses of Parliament,
(whose weakness, perverseness, unevenness, inconstancy and cowardice God has
seen, disliked, judged, and punished) you have forcibly invaded, scattered and
oppressed; notwithstanding all your special Engagements to them both of duty
and promise, commission and trust. The ^oyalty and love of the people, you
every where either with terror and cruelty seek to suppress and smother, so
that they shall not dare to petition for redress, or complain of those
endless calamities which they suffer under your tyranny; or ^lse making lies
your hope and refuge, with forged semblances of complyant Petitions, and
counterfeit Gratulations, you falsely and impudently pretend the concurrent
Votes of the Countries, and the Communities ^pprobation to your most abominated
practices: When God knows and even your selves in your bloody di^^imulation
cannot be ignorant, that the generality of all men in all places, of all
degrees, do from their souls utterly abhor, deprecate and detest, your
execrable counsels, and accursed actions, which have thus brought upon us the
abomination of desolation, through the damnable deceiveablenesse of your
unrighteousness: Nor do we believe that your pride and tyrannous hypocrisy
either finds any comfort in them, or much con^iders those papers, which seem
to own you or applaud your wicked deeds, further then they may carry on your
strong delusions with the vulgar, whom you know to be neither very wary of
evil, nor very steady in what is good. If you had the general consent of the
Vulgar (which you know you have in no sort) yet neither is their judgment any
good rule to measure the morality of your actions; nor their inconstant
pleasure any test of honor, virtue or piety: But indeed you (as well as we)
are sadly conscious, that all those clamorous Petitions for Justice, by which
you would seem (as by Oracles of your own inspiring to be fatally directed and
divinely encouraged in your Cruelties and Treasons) were nothing else but the
strokes of the Lions own tail, the more to enrage himself; the very froth and
scum, which arose only from the zealous activity and boylings of your own
bloody Faction; who restless as Devils, continually go about seeking whom they
may deceive and destroy, we are well assured that your Schismatic crew of
Regicides are no more to be compared to the people of England, then the
Gleanings may be to the Harvest; or Canters, Thi^ves, Beggars and Juglers to
the sober and settled Dwellers in this Kingdom.

No, every honest man, who has any sense of piety, loyalty, modesty, pity or
humanity left in his soul, (as you have none) takes up Jacobs words against
you, Cursed be your wrath for it is fierce and your anger for it is cruel: into
the secrets of these men let not our souls enter; Lord lay not the guilt of the
sins of these men to the Charge of the people of this Kingdom.

No, let the blood of our pious, patient and most Christian King be upon you
and your Abettors for ever; who, as without any sense of loyalty, pity or
charity, so without any shadow as well as substance of Justice, having neither
Law, Rule, nor any due Authority, first by fraud and unheard of Insolency
seized upon his Majesty's person, afterward by flatteries, lies, and terrors
sought to deceive him; At last by mere force and b^^stl^ke cruelty have
massacred and as so many horrid Assa^sinates utterly destroyed him.

And all this after many fawnings, and shows of loyal and tender regard
toward his Majesty and his Royal Family, as both your first Proposals, and
your after Agitations, (honestly and very providentially discovered by Major
Huntington) do declare; In which all men now plainly see, that you did but make
way by the Fox, to let in the Wolf, and by your Dalilah to bring the Philistims
upon our Sampson: Yea, after his Majesty was not only entered into and advanced
in a Treaty with the two Houses, agreeable to their Votes, and the general
desires of all his Subjects; under the most solemn National security and
Public Faith, which could be given or pass between a King and his Subjects,
or indeed any honest men: But even when his Majesty's great wisdom and
goodness had so far brought all things to a fair closure and happy
Agreement, that the two Houses were satisfied and resolved to proceed upon his
Majestyes Conce^ions, as a firm ground of Peace to the Kingdom.

Yet after all these public, civil and Sacred Obligations, which lay upon the
two Houses and the Kingdom, on your selves as well as any and all of us; for
you to seize again upon his Majesty's person, without any pretended Authority,
and with your Iron hands, and Adamantine hearts to ravish and pull him out of
the arms and embraces of his Subjects, violently to hale and tear him from the
reviving love and loyalty of the two Houses and his people; thence to hurry and
toss him to and fro, to what inhospitable places, and desolate Prisons you
listed, there to deprive him, not only of all things proportionable to his
quality as a King, but even of those civil accommodations, which ought to be
allowed to any Gentleman, though an ^nemy and a Captive of War; which the King
never was, not being taken by force, but rendering himself to the professed love
and sworn loyalty of his Subjects. After this, with a sacrilegious mo^kery of
Justice, in the highest affronting of God, the King, the Parliament, and the
three Kingdoms, by an unheard of and most horrid Outrage, and riotous force to
oppress and utterly destroy the remaining honor, freedom and power of the
two Houses; and in despite of them to erect a new Court of Justice (as you most
unjustly term it) for which you have no color of Law from God or Man, no
precedent in this or any other Christian Kingdom, no ground or pretense of
Parliamentary consent or Autho^ity, of either Houses (whose M^mbers, three
parts of ^our at least, you forcibly detayned and deterred from sitting in the
House of Commons, the Lords being unanimously against you; by all which methods
of cunning and violence you seek like Absalo^ (the co^tradiction be^tween whose
name and actions, very well fits your affected but undeserved title of Saints)
to intrude your selves into a Judicative as well as a Military power, (as if
Hangmen and Executioners should u^urp the seats of Judges, who are not fit to
be of a Jury; since their interest and advantage (like yours) lying in the
destruction of others, will ^asily tempt them to condemn any man.)

At length you make a shift to pack, not a high Court of Justice, as you
shamelessely style it, but the basest Conventic^e of Injustice that ever was in
the world; In which all Cards of honor being shuffled out, you turn up such
Knaves only for Trumps as will best play your game: A very Medly and R^psody of
the most ignorant, shallow, cowardly, cruel, weak, debaucht and insolent fools
or Athiests; Hypocrites, Traitors and Tyrants, that ever usurped power over any
honest and innocent man: Your President Bradshaw and your Clark Cook are
commonly known and branded to be men of as corrupt souls as any lived in their
profession; their most traiterous and covetous villainies not allowing the least
pretense of ignorance in the Laws, which are in no case more clearly,
expressly, and se^verely contrary, then in this, of taking away the Kings
life, wherein they, against all law, du^y and conscience, were as Judas^s
^hiefly employed.

At last upon the wicked, most unjust, and cruel sentence of these mercenary,
unauthorised^ and Tyrannous Sycophants, and Hucksters of Justice, (who must
needs have their Comm^ssion from him that is the Father of lies, the false
Accuser, the Old Murderer, the deceiving Serpent, the R^aring Lion, the Red
Dragon, the Dead Sea of cruelty and the sink of all Confusion, the Damned and
Damning Devil, and not from God (the Fountain of Justice, the Father of Mercy,
the Institutor of Order, the Author of Peace, and the Commander of ^^bjection
to Law^ull Kings) in any ^^tion imaginable; further then the Devil may have
Commission from God, permitting and limiting the activity but not approving the
activity but not approving the iniquity of his rage and malice,) to compel
such a King, so Great a Monarch of three Kingdoms, their Undoubted Sovereign
Lord, to submit to the^r Arraignment, Accusations^, and Sentence (who were most
of them his declared and desperate Enemies) without allowing him the l^be^ty of
prot^sting against their confessed Usurpation and Non-authority, or of pleading
for his own both Innocence, and well known Privilege, Sovereignty, and
unquestionable Immunity, according to the Laws of God and of this Kingdom;
which are expr^ssely against their traiterous and tyrannous proceedings, as
well as the nullity of their Authority.

After this, without an^ remorse or pity to their and our King, to force a
person of so excellent worth, wisdom, virtue, honor, and Majesty to bow down
at the feet of so vile persons, and then to Chop off h^s Head which was Sacred,
Crowned and Anointed, as rightful King over them and all his Subjects in his
Dominions. (A Butchery so barbarous, that the common Headsman abhorred to do
it; nor may we think those bloody Zealots were willing he should d^prive them
of the pleasure of cutting the throat of such a Sacrifice, to inaugurate them
in their Royal Priesthood; by which their Schismatic fury p^etends a title
against, or above all Lawful Kings and Governors.

What Words, what Tera^, what Sihgs, what oppressive Thoughts, what secret and
unutterable Reflect^ons of most stupifi^d and aston^^hed Sou^s, are sufficient
to measure the Immensity, to weigh the burden, to express or conceive the
h^rror of this outrag^ous sin, and most flagitious villainy.

Poor Prince, after so many delusions, so many lying Addresses, made by the
chief Engines and movers of the Army; after so much patience, so great
demonstrations of excellent wisdom, meekn^sse, calmnesse and Christian
gentleness to his very Enemies and Jaylours; under infinite reproaches,
injuries and indignities, even to the very spitting in his face; after all
those gracious condescendings, by which he had reduced himself almost to the
v^ry shadow and bare name of a King (saving that he had gained the highest and
most absolute Empire in the renewed love and loyalty of the most and best of
his Subjects) that he might please all, secure and satis^ie all, purchase Peace
for all at any rate but the price of his Conscience: Yet after all these
infinite demonstrations of goodness, capable to have softened even Devils
themselves, to be thus butcher^d by a Soldie^y and Schismatic cruelty, to be
brought to public execution without any help or redemption from Parliament or
people (who generally abominated so horrid, inhumane, unseen, and unheard of a
Spectacle; whose Public Faith, besides their Personal Al^egiance was engaged
for his Majest^es honor and safety,) what ^^art can be large enough to equal
the sorrow, what ^yes can be Fountains sufficient to d^plore so unmerited a
Fate, befalling so excellent a Prince, by the malice, ambition, cruelty and
treason of so base and execrable villainies.

And all this Tragedy of Tragedies c^rried on to such bloody conclusions, under
color of Safety and Reformation at first; afterward of satisfaction and
Indemp^ity to the Army; in both which the Good King deny^d nothing, that m^n of
an^ mod^st^, worth or ingenuity, could exp^ct or would desire. Yet a^t^r
^^fi^ite delusions, and mutinous Insolences committed against King, Pa^l^am^nt
and People, some impotent and amb^t^ous Tyrants, (who have the marks of Blood
and Cruelty in their faces and on their Foreheads, in the Army and Commons
House bethink themselves of a Scene of Justice, which must speedily be acted by
them least the closure of a Peace with the King and the two Houses should
render their employment useless, as it has long been burdensome; and forceing
their Buffe Grandees and proud Officers to return to their Needles, their
Hammers, their Lasts, their Sl^ngs, their Carts and their Flails, should qui^e
defeat those designs of power, estate and all licentious profaneness both in
Opinions and Practices; which their Chief Officers and Levelling sticklers have
all this while designed for themselves and their false, giddy, cruel, covetous
and unreasonable Faction; through that power and influence, which by their
lies, forceries and hypocrisies, they with the help of that mungrel Minister,
that Military Priest, that modern Simon Magus, that disguised Executioner, that
bloody Butcher of the King H -- P -- they have gained upon the Common
Soldiery. Upon whose simpl^city and val^ur they have presumed tyrannously and
trayterou^^y to advance the mere will and pleasure of some Officers in the
Army, and those rotten and ever infamous Members of the Commons, over all the
Laws and Liberties, the Lives, Estates and Inheritances both of King, Prince
and People.

Yet after all these Scenes of various Villainies, they have the impudence to
glory, as if they had done God good service, and so extremely pleased God and
the People, that they expect all should agree to their Pla^dite, as if might
and right were well met in the Army.

O you most seared Consci^nces, you most R^bellious Souls against God, the
King, and your own light; you most accursed Doers^ you deaf Adders, whether you
will hear or w^^ther you will forbear, know this, That we the Christ^an people
and l^yall Subjects of England, do in the bittern sse of our Souls declare (^s
in the ^ight of God, to whose just Tribunal we appeal, and summon your stupid
and cruel hypocrisy) to all the world, our to all detestation, and utter
ab^orring of your Counsels, Actions and future Designs. You glory, as if you
were now Masters of our Estates, Liberties and Lives: But we shall by Gods
grace keep our Souls unspotted from those great Offenses and presumptuous
wickedness, wherewith you are infected beyond all cure or recovery.

No we would have your impeni^ent hardness, as well as the softer world to
know, That we look back wi^h extreme sorrow, shame and repentance, upon our
former Delusions and forwardness to this Unhappy War; wherein though they
were most to blame who were the Deceive^s and Instigators of us; yet we cannot
excuse our selves further then thus, That we did it out of credulo^^
inconsiderateness, and not out of malicious wickednesse^ The God of Heaven,
whose mer^ie^ exceed our sins and your cruel ies, forgive the Errors and ^reat
sins of this Nation in this Unnatura^l War; which have deservedly as from the
Divine vengeance, though most perfidiously, as from your multiplied Tre^sons
and wilful R^bellions, b ought upon these Kin^doms such a sore plague and
intolerable opp ession as you are.

Whose detected hypocrisy has now made it clearly appear, That both King,
Parliament and People ^ere merely cheated and abused, by the Fra^d first, after
by the Force of those Factiouss, Schismatic, bloody and implacable spirits,
your chief Genius's; who de^paired to carry on their wicked D^signs of Ambition
and Tyranny, but by the means of Anarchy, P^ofanen^sse, Disloyalty, and public
ruin of Church and State.

All which Rottenness and Villainy must be masked awhile under the Names of
Reformation, Laws and Liberties, King and Parliament, which we see too
evidently (though too late) after infinite miseries, Oppressions, Bloodshed,
and Delusions, amount to no more but a slavish Submission to the will and
Arbitrary Tyranny of a few sanguinary Schismatics, cruel Hypocrites, and
desperate usurpers over all; who, like deep Ditches, and open Sepulchers,
having swallowed up, our King, our Parliament, our Estates, our Liberties, and
many of our Brethrens Lives, now like impudent Strumpets, in the wantonness
and security, to which success have hardened their hearts and Foreheads, wipe
their mouths as if they had done no evil; and now lying in wait for our
precious Souls, dress their whorish Faces with the Harlotry and temptation of a
New fashioned Representative, and that both silly and ridiculous Babble called
the Agre^ment of the People.

Then which never any poison was presented in a sordider and less suspected
Cup; nor foolish Devil never used less inviting baits for his snares: Their
gross and brutish unp^liticknesse offering nothing in that Beggars dish to the
miserably abused, and justly discontented Kingdom, but only such general dull
and confused notions, as might become the soberer sort of ^icts or Highlanders,
or the less savage Ind^ans, when from their Acorns, nakedness, and barbarity
they began to form some conceptions of casting themselves into more orderly and
civil Societies, for their better Government and Common welfare; so vastly
short their m^tly Agreement comes of those most tried, wise, noble, rational,
just, and indeed Divine Principles and Foundations of True Government, Order
and Polity, on which this famous Monarchy has for many hundred of years been
raised to so stately a Fabric; having flourished to so perfect a beauty, to so
ancient and venerable a glory, as became the Wisdom^, Piety and Gravity of our
former Kings, Parliaments and Ancestors; men of Renown for true Wisdom and
Heroic Greatness; to whom these late Ov^rturners and Innovators of all
Government would scarce have served for their Dwarfs, Zanies, and Bussoons.

But least these Cursed M^vers of the Ancient Boundaries and Landmarks should
lose both themselves and us in the Wood and Wilderness of their poor, rude,
barbarous and novell projections they bring forth their Ignes Fatui, lights of
private Inspirations, Fan^tick Delusions, False and Falsified Interpretations
of wrested and corrupted Scriptures, to make some show to their seduced
Pr^selytes (whom they would rebaptize in the blood of the King with themselves)
as if they were the little stone cut without hands which must become a great
Mountain, etc. They the Saints which must bind Kings in Chains, and Nobles in
Links of Iron, etc. They the people of the most High, to which the Kingdoms of
the Earth must be given, etc. Whereas true Saints, which had the power, not
show only of godliness, would not take all the Kingdoms of the world upon such
D^v^l^sh Co^d^tions, and by such d^mnable practis^s, as yours are, most
apparent, and by your selves confessed to be unjustifi^ble. Such Scripture
paintings upon the f^ce of your Jezeb^ll would have served the turn of John of
Leyden, Knipp^rdoling, Muncer, and those other Impostors your infamous
pred^cessors, as well as you and indeed they were by them no less pretended;
but with how blessed success you are loath to own or remember, as presaging
your like destinyes in Gods due time.

It is a strange and unwonted way of any sound and true Christians, apparently
to violate and wholly decline from the obedience of clear moral precepts of
justice and other both Religious and Civil Duties to God and man, under a
pretense of Zeal and a Call to fulfill prophetic Obscurities; which darkly
foretell what shall be done but do not precisely command us to do this or that;
In which eve^^s even the wickedest men and Antichrists (such as these are) may,
as the Vials of the wrath of God, pour out themselves, and have a great part
to act, and yet receive no comfort or reward, other then that of Hypocrites;
who may (as Joseph's Brethren, and N^buchadnezzar did) then most serve Gods
P^ophetick and Providentiall disposings, when they act most contrary to h^s
Revealed will, and only seek to se^ve their own envy, covetousness and
unsatiable Tyranny, however they may as the Devil bait their Temptations with
Scripture Allegations.

But know O ye hard-^earted Bels^azzars (whom no ^and-writing out of Gods
Words, clearly setting forth your sin, curse, woe and damnation can yet scan or
deterr from your frolic villainies) That, if you were Angels from Heaven, as
you are Luciferan brats from Hell, (transforming your selves at first into
Angels of light: but now fully uncased; so that now your fiery eyes, your black
and wide mouths, your blasting and sulphurious breath, your proud horns, and
your cloven feet appear to all but your own besotted ^mps and familiars^ if (we
say) you yet appeared as Angels, yet you should give us leave to believe the
express will and Word of God, rather then your juggling fancies, to which that
is diametrically contrary, both in the Precept and all practices of Christ and
his true Saints. H^ar how the voice of God disagrees with your apparent folly
and madness. He bids honor and obey the King and our lawful Governors; you
cry cr^cifie, destroy, and scatter them. Christ commands to give unto Caesar's
that which is Caesar's, no less then to God what is Gods: But you take away as
from God and his Church what is his; so from our Caesar, his Empire, Liberty,
life, posterity and all.

The voice of God bids us se^k peace and ensue it, branding with the reprobate
marks of Hypocrites, those that as Traitors, heady, highminded, and fierce
despisers of what is good, break all Truce or Treaties, which you have done,
beyond what ever the falsest miscreants ever did.

The Word of God is a clear constant, uniform light as to the rules of an holy
life in Piety, Equity and Charity; ^ut your opinions, practices and pious
pretentions, Centaure-like are various and deformed Changlings, many-shapen and
misshapen Monsters, shifting Proteusses, slippery and virtiginou^ Serpents,
folded and hidden in the winding labarinths and intr^cate circulations of your
many subtle, ^ly, and perplexed designs.

The truth is, there is as wide a difference between your clamors, h^wlings,
and hideous yellings (which sound nothing but war, blood, Rebellion, Famine,
Death, Desolation and Damnation) and that soft^ sweet gracious and most
glorious v^yce of God in the holy Scriptures, (which you use for a Net not a
Garment) as there is between the most bright beautiful Soul savi^g-Truths, and
most black deformed Souldamning-lies. Your selves cannot think us uncharitable,
if we do believe and tell you, That you have more blasphemed the Spirit, Name,
Grace, Word, Saints, and Servants of God, by intitling these as Inspirers,
Authors, and Approvers of your most graceless and devilish practices; then
ever those hard-hearted and impudent Hypocrites the Pharisees did, by imputing
the saving miracles of our Lord Jesus Christ to your Beelzebub the Prince of
Devils; whose servants you are, whose work you do, and whose wages you must
exspect.

Nor do we doubt but all the curses written in the Book of God (which like that
of Meroz, have been causlesly, factiously and falsely by some of you^
double^faced Janus's formerly imprecated upon the King and his loya^^^st
Subjects) will certainly overtake and fall upon both you and your viperous
generation.

We hope God will in his infinite goodn^sse not suffer this dying Church and
desolated Nation, to be further partakers of your Babylonish sins and open
Sorceries least we be partakers of your plagues and torments; which are laid up
in the treasures of the wrath both of God and all good men against you and your
desperate faction.

We tell you, we are so far from counting you Saints and Saviors, that we look
upon you as the Tophet which God has indeed prepared for the King and these
Kingdoms, to try and torment them a while; but we doubt not, but God will at
last cast you (who are our sin, our death, and our Hell) into the lake that
burns with fire and brimstone for ever.

Unless you repent; so many of you Officers and Soldiers as are capable of
Repentance, not being so deeply and maliciously engaged in the desperate sins
of those men your chief leaders and seducers, who being past feeling, of a most
r^probate sense, greedy and unreas^nable sinners, make no conscience to damn
your souls, for the perf^cting their ambitious and covetous designs, for which
they have hitherto made use of the hands of so many valiant men worthy of a
better work and a nobler war, whereby to destroy your and our King, subvert our
Parliaments, Laws, Government, and Religion; and all this, against all your and
our Protestations, Vows, Oaths, Promises and Covenants to God and man.

O you that have followed these Theudasses, as the seduced people sometime did
Absalom in the simplicity of your hearts, not aware of their devilish
stratagems, devises, and designs; you that have any touch of Gods Spirit, or
his grace in your hearts; any fear of God or dread of sin left in you; you that
have any sense of your souls eternal welfare (which those either qu^stion or
deny) any terror of the wrath of God, or hope of his love and mercy; you that
are afraid to degenerate into unreasonable Beasts, or incarnate Devils, (That
you may enjoy the benefit of the Kings last charitable Prayers for your pardon
and repentance) make have to depart from the tents of these A chans, these
Korahs, these sinners who know themselves accursed of God and men. Come out of
their Babylon, which is become the habitation of Devils, and the hold of every
foul spirit, a cage of every unclean and hateful Bird, by a penit^nt and pious
withdrawing from such filthy Harpies, such cunning, yet cruel Hyena's, such
weeping yet devouring Crocodiles; such Banners as bear not the Kings Arms, but
his head cut from his body; such Banners as are dyed in the blood of their
King, murdered by them, while they pretended to fight for him, and preserve
him.

O drink no more of the wine of the wrath of their Fornications, which they
hold forth in that poisonous and filthy cup of their Agreement of the People;
with which they hope to make drunk this whole Nation; that as Lots incestuous
Daughters; their lusts may be fully impregnated b^ the conjunction of the
strength, riches and counsel of these Kingdoms: Know you for certain (O you
Soldiers) that no place of Repentance can be found among those Esaus and
Judas's who have been the chief and mal^cious actors and contrivers of these
wicked and cruel confusions; whose names as we well know; so we are sure the
hand of God will find them out; making them (who have been the terror and
torture of men of all degrees,) to become as Pashur, Magorncissabis; terror
round about, as a wheel, in past revolutions from prosperous wickedness to
miserable punishments; as chafe tossed to and fro by the breath of Gods
displeasure, and the execration or abhorrence of all people in all Nations,
Christian and Heathen; where ever they are driven to be Vagab^nds and
Runnagates: carrying with them in their fester'd conscienc^s the forked arrow,
of their deceiving and then cruelly destroying both their King, and their
Country.

And this, till they are cast into the chains of utter da^kness, who have
quenched the light of Israel; and to everlasting flames, whose wrath kindled
with the fire of Hell, has burned to the very foundations of so happy a Nation.

No person of worth, Honor or Piety, but will ever loath to eat, dri^k, or
converse with them, looking upon them as unlucky prodigies: much more will
every ingenuous man or woman abhor ever to marry or make any affinity with
them, or their families polluted with the blood of their King; but most of all
abominated will they be as to any Communion with them in Prayer or other
religious duties; who having turned the grace of God into wantonness; cannot
but already hear Judasses si ent clamors, deep despairings and
self-condemnings; like Julian the Apostate, they cannot but feel the secret and
sma^t strokes of God in their consciences, for betraying, persecuting and
destroying the innocent blood of our King. O E^rth cover it not, O Tim^ forget
it not, O Heaven fail not to reveng^ their prodigal and cruel wast of so royal
and precio^s blood! Sur^ly without any uncharitab^e ra^^n^sse, they may be
suspected to be past all grace and recovery by any Prayers. There remaining for
such sinners of the sin to death, such relapsing Swine and reso^bing Dogs, who
pre^ending to have escaped the poll tions of the world, are returned to their
mire and vomit; feigning to be illuminated Saints; yet have wrought such works
of thick darkness, nothing but a fearful expectation of vengeance, and fiery
indignation to consume them.

They have impudently and traitorously judged, condemned, and murdered the
King upon the pretense of his raising War against the Parliament; of which
fact themselves are doubly and most unquestionably guilty before all the world,
twice menacing, invading, and forcibly assaulting their Masters in the two
Houses of Parliament. Nor if their charge had been true against the King (which
upon his death he both denied, and most evid^ntly proved by the legal right he
had to the Militia, and the date of their Commissions for raising war, before
his Majesty's were out) yet were not these Usurpers any competent Judges by God
or man appointed; nor was indeed that calumny the real motive of their sudden,
bloody, and resumed cruelty; but only that extreme fear, hatred and terror
their hypocrisy and villainy had conceived against the Kings excellent wisdom,
constant piety, and immovable goodness; which they had so often, and so
unmeasurably abused; and which they saw was the chiefest obstacle in the way of
their Sacrilegious Ambition.

And now like desperate Empyricks upon whose c^uel tamperings we have sp^nt our
Blood, our Estates, our Lives; the honor of our Nation^ and the credit of our
Reformed Religion: You (now) pr^^end to stop that bloody Issue (which by tumult
and treason you have made) by destroying the whole Royal Family, and le^ting
out all the ancient blood of our Kings out of the veins of these Kingdoms; to
ext rpate Kings, Peers, and Parliaments; and by ^^dle fi^tions of your weak and
c^n^used brains to obtrude the fri^p^ry and gull^ry of ^our Agreement of the
People.

As if all rules of Justice, all true Policy and Reason of State, and good
grounds of Government (no less then all wickedness, cruelty, hypocrisy and
treason) only dwelt in your shallow brains and narrow ^earts: Who for the most
part are not guilty of any Learning or Civil Improvements; are open and
declared Authors of Ignorance, Con^usion and Tyranny; Enemies to all sober
manners and good Order, both in Church and State.

Nor do those great things (as you call them) which you have hitherto with most
inf^mous treachery and cruelty peracted and attained, any way render you
considerable with sober, godly and truly wi^e men: For what may not Frontlesse
Hypo^rites do, who have forsaken God, and given themselves over to the Devils
Captivity, when empowered with Arms and might, they resolve barbarously to
break through, and cast off, all bonds of right, trust, duty, credit and
conscience to God and Man, as you h^ve done.

But O you hardened and infatuated Regicides, c^n you in good earnest flatter
your selves, that this foolish Toy, this shameless Imposture, your Bastard
Brat, your headl^sse Chymera, your many-headed Hydra, called The Agreement of
the people, (but by as ^ull an Antiphrasis, as the Fiends and ^uries of Hell
were called Eumenides) will be a salve sufficient to heal, or Plaster to cover
the wide deep and festered wounds, which your treacherous cruelty has made
upon this Kingdom in all Estates, both jointly, as in Parliament, and
severally, as in the interests of the Crown, the Nobility, the Clergy and the
Comm^ns.

No, your selves know, that very Ti^le, which you shameles^y impose upon your
mad and deformed Model is nothing but a Lie and F^lsity; b^ing in no sense The
A^r^ement of the people, nor we hope ever like to be. Neither in their
Representatives the Commons, whom you have disbanded and cashiered in the
Majority; leaving ^nly some few Members left^ whose A^inine p^tience and
stupidity suffers th Bala^ms of the Army, as mad and false Prophets to ride
upon them for the price of blood, and wages of Iniquity: To which Vassallage,
we hope no Gentlemen of any Honor or Conscience, will ever betray themselves
or their Country by returning to that House again, or sitting and voting
there, while it is under such insolent Tyrants.

Nor will you find it more agreeable to the generality of the people
throughout the Kingdom both Ministers and others, who in their souls disagree
as much from what you have done and by that further design, ^s li^ht does from
darkness, liberty from Oppression, and G^d from your Dictator the Devil.

No, the People of England, will o^e day (if God please to cast his Net upon
you, and put his hook into the all d^vouring jaws of your Leviathan) make you
and your Dawbers with the untempered mortar of a mouldred and dissolved
Parliament, to unde^stand; that they abominate ^ou and your deeds, as much as
Hell it self; for your monstrous sins are their own Hell and Horror, more to be
detested then all the sinl^sse sufferings of He^l.

The ancient and most Honorable H^^se of Peers, whom sometimes you flattered
into a Fools Paradise, (while the poor shreds and remnants of that Court might
serve your ^urn to face your affairs by any s^^w of their Authority) as if you
had designed nothing to their dim^^^tion: Yet you have wholly laid t^em aside,
as useless and dangerous Idols of honor, fit to be cast out to the Bats and
Moles, to be levelled unto or abased beneath, the meanest Animals, and vilest
beasts of the People; for though they should, any of them, so dishonor
themselves as to descend into the Hell of your infected walls; yet c^uld ^hey
never there ascend to any degree of public influence either for Counsel or
Action, being sure to be always overlay^d, smothered and oppressed by your
over voting crew of Mechanic Idols; who saving that they have mouths to speak
a Treasonable Y^a or Not; in other points, have Eyes and see not, Noses but
smell not, Hearts but consider not, the blood, cruor, carkases, skulls and dead
bo^es of their King and their Brethren of all degrees, with which they have
inhuman^ly filled that Charn^ll-house, that Golgotha of that quondam H^use of
Comm^ns.

Sure the numerous, and once both famous and flourishing Nobility of England,
besides those of Ireland and Scotland, cannot but infinitely abhor and detest
your arrogant despising of them, and trampling upon them; if they have but any
drops of their Ancestors noble blood running in their veins, or any sparks of
true Honor left in their Breasts: It will at length kindle such a fire of just
indignation and revenge in those Cedars as shall consume such base shrubs, such
offensive thistles, and such domineering Briars: But if their ignoble
despondency have so debased them to Luxury and Cowardice, that they dare not
vindicate the Honor of their Nation, Name and Order, together with the rights
of the Crown, the Fountain of their Honor, but are content to be either bowed,
or hewed down, or overdripped, or exsuccated by such Aspiring Ivyes as you are;
our Counsel is, that the ancient Barons of England, sometimes Peers and chief
Counselors in Parliament, would solemnly Degrade themselves, lay aside their
vain and ridiculous Titles, reverse their Escocheons, sell their Scarlet Robes
to the Brokers in Long-lane, rather then keep them, either to feed Moths, or to
be Monuments to all Posterity, What Capons, Poultroons and degenerous Buzzards
they are, descended from such Eagl^s, as many of their Ancestors were.

But if the Nobility should so far betray and desert themselves, their
Posterity, their King and their Country (who though their number be not great,
yet their interest is; and so might their influence on the Public yet be,
both great and good, if their spirits and gallantry were such, yet, how can you
the greater buggs of the Army; or you the lesser Vermin and Maggots of the
Commons (who survive and crawl after the dissolution of your Parliament; bred
of, and feeding upon, the putrefaction of that House) How can you think, that
the People of England, who are generally and highly concerned in the Honor,
Credit and Religion of the Nation, can ever with a good Con^cience, or any face
of common honesty agree to your Juggling and Sophistry; as if you or your
Western Mahomet and new Antichrist (Hugh Peter's) had any Pap^l power to absolve
their souls from those Protestations, Covenants, O^ths of Allegiance and
Supremacy, by all which they were and are both lawfully and ^eligiously bound,
under the greatest curses of God both to the Kingdom in general, and specially
to the Parliaments Privileges, and the Rights of the King and his lawful
Successors: of which gross and manifold perjuries they must make themselves
guilty, only to make way to the Dictatorship and Empire of some of your greater
Brambl^s; That (forsooth) the People of England might enjoy that Liberty, Peace
and Plenty under your unavoidable Tyranny, unsatiable Rapine, and cruel
Oppression; o^ such Beggars as most of you are, and were, which formerly they
c^uld never have under the gracious Kings wi^e and Loyal Parliaments, the
ingenuous Laws, and excellent Government of this sometime flourishing Kingdom.

Sure you are not yet so much beasts as to think, that the Community of this
great people can all govern themselves, or mutually one another: Government
must necessarily be settled and centred somewhere: Nor is it likely, that your
Leaders and Bashaes, whose hands are embrued in the blood of their King, will
ever be so modest, as to lay themselves aside; and denying their own most
ambitious and cov^tous desires, to let any others but themselves and their
creatures reap the fruit of their projects and labors; for which they have
pawned their souls to the Devil, and sold themselves as Ahab to do wickedly.

But, if you dare venture it upon so ingenuous a Trial, let the people of
England without your terror, cunning, injurious restraints and exceptions be
their own Umpires, and Choosers, whether they will bear the light and easy
yoke of the ^aws, and the gentle as well as just chastisements of their
penalties under a lawful King, or the iron-yoke of your Tyranny, and the
Scorpions of your wills, being so many Evening Wolves, bloody Traitors, and
unlimitted Tyrants, (whose little fingers in these last three years have been
infinitely heavyer then the loins of all the Kings, that ever were in this
Kingdom) let the people have free suffrages, you will soon find, That the true
Agreement of the People (a hundred voices to one) is this, to shake off your
cruel Tyranny, to bring to condign punishment such unheard of Traitors; and to
invest in his Throne our lawful King Charles the Second; the Eldest Son of that
good King you lately murdered. But how can the people of England ever hope to
have any other Civil Agreement of theirs bin^ing to you and your pragmat^ck
faction; further then your own fancies, lusts, and pleasures think fit; since
they find you to have so lately broken through all Laws of God and Man; all
Ancient and Fundamental Agreemen's in this Nation, on which the Honor and
Safety of our Kings, the Privileges of our Pa^liaments, the Liberties of the
People, the Order and Purity of our Church, and the happiness of our Nation
were settled? What Cautions can you give that you will hereafter submit to any
Public Agreement; who are such sh^fters, juglers and dissemblers, that no
Laws, Leagues, Covenants, Protestations or Promises you freely make can bind
^ou; No faith to King, Parliament, People, neighbor Nations, or God A^mighty
can hold you; but like the man possessed with the unclean spirit, you break all
ties and bonds, casting Church and State into fire or water, as the rash
motions of your Frantic humors carry you, etc.

Conscience you can have none; since your lights are so Lunatic, and your
principles vary every month.

Credit you have none, who have made bankrupt of the Publiq^e Faith, and
forfeited so many solemn and Sacred Obligations to God and Man.

Sense of Honor or Duty you can have none, since you have neither fear of God,
nor reverence of man.

Estates you have little or none to hazard or loose upon any forfeiture of your
Faith or Agreement: And for your Heads and Lives they are now so vile and
cheap, that although you are not fit to live, yet they are scarce worth the
taking.

Sure you cannot but appear to your selves as well as to all men, the most
outlawed, notorious and Stigmatized Re^els, the most perfidious Traitors that
ever any King, or Senate, State or People employed or trusted: Having utterly
blotted out all your former promeritings and good service so much boasted of;
Since the Event proclaims you served not King, Parliament, or Co^ntrey, but
your own lusts and villainous designs, which by the advantages of mutinous power
you now seek to accomplish under the now void and forfeited Commission of that
stupid Saint, that stain of Honor, that dumb show of your silent, extatick and
seduced General the poor and Unexcellent Lord

So that the darkning of your most wicked designs by this title of The
Agreement of the People, amounts to no more in the true and last sense of it,
but this, That you would have the People of England, and the other two united
Kingdoms, willingly to bow down to your Hoddy dody; your all Breech-Idol, as
your own Prophet so variously and falsely inspired, justly calls your unlickt
and monstrous projects, not of Government, but of Anarchy and Tyranny.

You would have us all to pledge you in that horrible draught of the Kings
blood, which you have greedily drank; to approve and ab^^ your execrable
villainies; and to submit for ever to the intolerable Tyranny of such Goths,
Vandals, and Saracens as you are.

Who are but the Devils Leiutenants; Factors for the God of this impure world;
signal Antichrists, accurate fulfillers of all the characters foretold, and
brands set upon you in the last and perilous times; in which true glass you and
all men may clearly see the ugly lineaments of your most deformed faces and
manners.

It is hoped, that God has yet so much mercy left in store for these sinful
(and by you most miserable) Kingdoms; as he gives us grace utterly to abhor
your desperate sins^^ So that we trust he will never suffer us by a Devilish
Apostasy to fall from all Vows, Oaths, and Covenants to God and man, by which
we and our posterity are bound to God, the Crown, and our Countrie^; only to
have yours and the D^vils absolution, to m^ke a Cove^^nt and Agreement with
Hell and Death; with your most irreligious and damnable designs and practices.

No, the sin and horror of your ways are now like Absaloms incestuous and
noonday Rapes, discovered in the sight of the Sun and all the world; Nor will
the s^btilty of your soft and fained voices like Sirens any more charm, and
enchant the honest people of England, into such Beasts and Monsters, ^s your
selves are; to whose hell^sh deformities you would have a^l others to conform:
They have seen and felt too much already of your cruel Hypocr^sies; your
devilish and strong delusions.

Have not your words been always Soloecisms to your purposes and your
practices contradictions to your pretenses?

Have you not as much as lies in your power and mal^ce cast us into the dead
Sea of disloyalty, perjury, cruelty, barbarity, irreligion, and confusion, that
is possible for any Nation suddenly to relapse and fall into, after so many
Sacred and Solemn Professions of Loyalty, and Reformation to God and the world,
whom we called to w^tness upon our souls?

Agreeable to all which, and to fill up the measure of our sins, as if our
Rebellion against God and the King were hitherto but a light and small matter,
by which we have most unhappily occasioned his death, by the hands of cruel
Edomites and cursed Amal^kites as you are; which most deplorable calamity to us
and this Na^ion we penitently look upon as the severest temporal st^oke which
the wrath of God, gone out against us, can infl^ct upon us. Yet your impudent
Hypocrisy now seeks to obtrude upon us your wretched and abhorred Agreement;
The sum of which is to leave the Kingdom without a King; Government without
Authority; Magistrates without Power; a People without Laws; a body without an
head; Sheep without a Shepherd; Christians without Christ; Churches without
Ministers; Ministers without Maintenance; a Nation without Faith: In a word,
you would have us live as men without souls, without God; wilfully degenerating
to beasts, without sense of virtue or vice, shame or honor; without fear of
Hell, hopes of Heaven, or thoughts of Eternity; and all this to maintain a few
Tyrannous Hypocrites, and Sodomitick Saints, the cry of whose sins like Sodom
is gone up to Heaven, and are a burden too heavy for the Earth to bear; Have
you not already made the Name of these Pretestant and Reform^d Churches to
stinck among ^ll Na^ions both Christian and Heathen, through the dead flies,
and ^ot en^^ss of your principles and ma^^^rs.

Have you not ^urp (...) the cunning and c^uelt^ o^ t^^ most ^^su^tick h^a^s
and (...) ^s ^^ch as you (...) o^ (...) an^ (...) to adv^^ce (...) above that
of Kings: But you upon baser principles seek to subject the Regal Sovereignty
to that of the People, as you call it; nor that you mean so in good earnest,
further then to delude the people, and to raise the heads of your desperate
Faction above all, both King, Prince, Peers and People.

We appeal to all sober Christians, whether your Treasons have not far
surpassed the Powder Conspiracy; Inasmuch, as they plotted secretly, but you
have peracted openly, the murder of the King, the ruin of all the Royal
Issue; the overthrow of all our Laws; the blowing up of all Parliaments; the
subverting of the whole State and Government; the devastation of your Country;
the abolition of all true Religion; the extirpation of all Liberty, Peace,
Order, and Humanity.

Your Elder Brother Faux himself might seem a Saint compared to you: whose New
Light, and Dark Lanthorn you have so long made use of to hide and disguise your
desperate intentions: Nor were the rest of those Powder Tray^ors so criminal as
you, if they had effected what they designed; since they neither pr^tended to
that Saintsh^p, or that smooth precisen^sse which you have done; nor had they
upon them such signal ties of Public and special Trust (besides your many
voluntary Obligations) The total violation of all which, renders your sins out
of measure sinful, and your Treasons incomparably traitorous: beyond what any
Ca^elines but your selves, ever had the desperate boldness to have conceived
or committed.

Had you been our Open Enemies, or self-raising Rebels in a declared r^valry
and enmity against King, Parliament and Country, we could either have
prevented and opposed you; or have born with less shame and disdain your
insolent and prevayling Cruelties against them all.

But when we consider what ostentation and show you made of exact obedience and
plenary a^quiescence in their Votes, Results, and Orders, from whom you had
your unhappy Commission; also of loyal regard to his Majesty's safety, Rights,
Honor and Posterity, (to whom some of your chief Commanders (as they well
know) engaged their souls, as much as was possible for any mortal men to do,
devoting themselves to all the Curses of God, t^mporall and etern^ll upon the
breach and failer of their words to his Majesty.

Add to these the fair gloseings you made at your first meeting, of speedy and
impartial endeavou^s to settle all things in Peace, Justice, due L^berty and
Piety; which how faithfully you have effected, the present Deplored state of
this Church and State may witness; whose face is now miserably squalled and
hideously besmeared with the blood of the King, and those most indelible
Reproaches wherewith you have blasphemed our God, our King, and our Religion.

We the people of England, of all sorts, Lords, Gentry, Clergy and Commons, do
again and again declare to God and all the world, the present Age and Posterity
so long as the world shall endure, our infinite abhorrence, utter detestation,
and to^all d^sagre^ment from what you the Officers of the Army; and your most
slavish, ever infamous and Unparliamentary Juncto have already done, or shall
further do, (through Gods vengeance upon this Nation) in prosecution of your
never sufficiently abominated Villainies.

Nor do we desire any thing more of the just and Alm^ghty God, (not in order to
the sati^faction of our private ma^^ce, or desire of revenge on any of you
(though our par^icular injuries have been many from you) but o^^y in order to
the publiqu^ Vindication of Go^s glory, the Ho^our of the Reform^d Religion,
the Loyalty, Faith and Credit of this Nat^on, the wiping away those foul sins
of Tr^^s^n, Perjury, Truce-breaking and Regal Parricide, (in all which
Villainies your execrable Faction, wallowing in the blood of your King and
fellowSubjects now seek impenitently and irreparably to implunge this whole
Nation;) That we might (as some solace under our immense sorrows, and
tyrannizing miseri^s infl^cted by you) but live to see Gods temporal
judgments so far upon you, as may pull down your Lucif^rian pride, and make
your obstinate minds to see the horror of your Villainies; That like Cain, you
may be afraid of all men; like Judas, accursed to all Posterity; given over to
Sa^an, and excommunicated by all good Chris^^ans, as Murderers of your Father,
Killers of your King; That you may ever be ha^ted with the r^full Ghost, and
hideous Phantasme of the King, whom you have trayterousl^ butchered: That the
exemplary vengeance of God may be upon you and your Adherents so rema^kably,
and in such a proportion to your Villainies, that if there be any place left for
Repentance, you may find it; and yet all the world may see, your destruction
is the Lords doing, and say, Doubtless, there is a God that judges the Earth.

Nor do we despair, but God will upon our true Repentance for our great sins
and sup^ne folly (which gave you advantages to fulfill your most odious
Villainies) so far remember his mercies to this most deplorable Kingdom, and
by you (as so many wild Bores) desolated Churches, as to stir up some
powerful Avenger of the Kings blood; and all that other innocent blood, which
the depths and dece^ts at first, the force and violence afterward, o^ your
bloody Faction has occasioned and caused to be shed; by your tumultuating the
people; your instigating the spirits of the two Houses with false and pannick
fears; your calumniating the King, and perverting his gracious purposes; your
enflaming the enmities, and heightning the Animosities on both sides; your
fraudulently voting, No Addresses, and publishing that lying and most infamous
Libell for your pretended grounds; your widening the differences, and hindering
all fair equable closings, both formerly, and in that last memorable Treaty at
Newport; of which you were the most rude, savage and perfidious Violators, that
ever History recorded.

We know, that you can now only trust in your Arm of Flesh, in the Devils aid
and Council, having in your works denied the Living God; instead of whom, your
Belly and the present World, are become your God and your glory: for the
satisfaction of which, and the attaining places of profit and power (agreeable
to your lusts, which are enlarged like Hell) you have dared to advance thus far
to the destroying of King, Parliament and Laws; which were the only boundaries
and conservers of our Peace, Properti^s, Liv^s and Liberties; yet after all
this, you inscribe on your Bloody Banners, and impudent foreheads, The
Agreement of the People; and the Restorers of our Liberties.

Which Plots, although you think them your Masterpieces for artifice, juggling
and policy (that so you might by fair words and flattering lies, allure the
many and meaner People to maintain those Monsters which you have brought forth)
yet you must know, That the People of Engl^nds eyes are not so bloodshotten,
nor their Consciences so seared, nor their Hearts so disloyal, nor their
senses so bewitched by your Magic and Charms, as not to see through, and fully
both discover and detest your devilish designs of Tyranny, Anarchy and
Profanen^sse, whereto you drive, through all these cloudings of immethodicall
Nonsense, and indigested scriblings; which like your late damnable Remonstrance
and your other illiterate and irrational Papers discover; that where there is
so much want of grace and common honesty as in you, it is impossible not to
want ^ven those shows of common sense and vulgar Reason, which are n^cessary
(not to justify (which no tongue, pen or wit of Devils can do) but so far as
to palliate your filth, and cover your nakednesse^ or to render your wicked
projects but tole^^bly plausible to those, that have the grossest perception of
things.

The better to temper this your Cup of deadly poison, to please the vulgar
relish (which you think is gross and undecerning) you tempt them with the name
of Liberty; first in Civil things; which all men see is but a mere Cheat,
while they are l^ke to be held under your Iron hands, and squeezed under your
tyrannous wills, and int^lerable Exactions; instead of in^o^ing the benefit of
our ancient and famous Laws (the best that any subjects in the world enjoyed,
the ju^t and only bo^^ds of our Liberti^s, and Conserver^ of our both Pe^ce and
P^osperities; to which all ^^n^st men (who have no jo^n^ stock with you in
k^^very, Pov^rty and baseness) desire most humbly and ^arnestly ^o return;
D^^pairing (an^ w^t^ good cause^ that ^v^r their L^b^rties and P^ope^ties can
be either a^vanced or def^^ded b^ y^u, who have been so insol^nt u^u^pe^s over
King, Parliament, and all our la^s and liberties; which o^r fore-fa^hers indeed
^njoyed many years, through God^ ^l^ssing and ^h^ Fatherly care of their
P^^nc^s, to a g^ea^e^ measure of peace, plen^y and Pie^y, ^hen ever can be
hoped for under such bloody L^eches, such n^merous and unsatiable Caterpillars,
as we have felt you to be: N^y, we tell you, we so far disdain, your
Hypocrisy, Treachery and Tyranny, that we had rather be under the Tyranny of
our rightful King (of whose justice and clemency we nothing doubt) then owe
our Liberty, as you call it, to such vile Mushrooms and detested Traitors as
you are; who boast of Liberty, yet are indeed slaves to your damned and
desperate lusts; studying nothing but how to delude the people with the name
and fancy of Liberty; as if you would persuade us rather to be the Devils
Freemen, as you are, (led Captaive by his will) then to be Loyal Subjects to
our lawful and most hopeful King; or hum^le servants to God, whose sacred ties
are many w^yes upon our souls, binding us to fear God, and to honor the King;
and no less to abhor you; and have no fellowship with such as are given to
seditious or perjurious changes: forbidding us to use our Liberty, as men and
Christians, for a cloak off maliciousness, perjury, tyranny, hypocrisy, and
all licentious villainies, as you have done.

The next pretense wherewith you bait the Mousetrap, and temper the Ratsbane of
your Agreement, is that of Liber^y in Religion; your meaning is; That men may
be free to profess no Religion; or any which they call such, so it be not the
true one; which you know is most opposite to your seditious, traitorous,
merciless, uncharitable and bloody Superstitions: The very truth is; you aim
at such an Intolerable toleration in Religion, as you think is most agreeable
to the profane hearts, and licentious manners of the most debauched lives and
Atheistical Spirits, with which you have already pestered this English world.

In order to this Truth-darkning, and Soul-damning design, we know you follow
your Leader the Devil, and his Lieutenant General, to the utter dissolving of
all Government, Order, and Discipline in the Church, to discourage all learned,
godly and painful Ministers; to rob and spoil them of all settled maintenance;
to reduce them and the work of the Ministry to that contempt, which in the
pride and luxury of these times follows poverty and beggary; That they
depending on the peoples good will and charity, (which in many you have made
bad and cold enough toward the best and ablest preachers) or upon your insolent
and niggardly stipends, they and their families may either eat their own dung,
and drink their own piss; or be forced by necessities of life to desert their
Function and places; so as to leave their Congregations destitute of all holy
public duties; or expose them to those Military Wolves and Mechanic Foxes,
which you have in great store provided for the supply of all places, in Church
as well as State.

Thus does your rage reach as high as Heaven, and as low as Hell: But we hope
the God of Heaven will look down upon us, and our children in mercy, and by
some speedy rebuke of such Satan's not suffer your folly and fury to proceed any
further, it being manifest to all moral and sober men, that you are Factors not
only for your selves, to devour our Estates, Houses, Lands, Liberties, Peace,
and Lives; but like the great Dragon, you pour forth a Sea off blood and
poison, ignorance, and profaneness, such as may for ever drown both our and our
childrens souls in Heathenish Barbarism, Superstition, Atheism, and Eternal
destruction.

But know O you neither Milstones, you poisonous Aspes, you
King-killing-Basilisks, you desperate deceivers and damnably deceived: That
although you have against all Faith of Turks, Jews, or any Heathens, by fraud
and force usurped upon our secular and civil liberties; so that at present we
have not any formed power to oppose you, and call your Ringleaders to a sev^re
account for your unheard of crimes and injuries against our King and our
Coun^rey. Yet shall our constancy in, and our suffe^ing for our Religion, and
our encouragement of godly, learned and faithful Mi^isters, to our best
abilities, make the world to see, that there is no Agreement between Christ in
us, and Belial in you; our God, and your Mammon.

We hope the Triumphing of such Hypocrites as you are, is but short; nor shall
you long insult over the dead and divided Corpse of our late Lord and Sovereign
King; whose Wisdom, Piety, Faith, and Patience God (we doubt not) has crowned
with Glory and Immortality; having perfected those many Princely gifts and
Divine graces in him (as God often does in his dearest Saints and Martyrs,
after the example of his crucified Son Jesus Christ) by his sufferings and your
cruelties; whose Memory and Posterity will be ever dear, precious, and honored,
to us and our succeeding generations as a King; who now appears, beyond the
Errors and Jealousies of former surmi^es ^chiefly raised and fomented by your
false and envious Faction) to have been the most constant Pil^ar, the Noblest
Patron, the resolutest Protector, and he most patient Martyr for our Laws,
Liberties, Lives, and Religion: yea and of our Parliaments true Privileges;
which his Majesty best saw, and fullest declare^ at first to have been
shamefully invaded and out-raged by your Tumults, after by your Armies, next by
your new modellings, at last by actual mutinings, impudent menaces, violent and
warlike impressions upon their safety, liberty, faith, loyalty and honor, with
which purposes you sometime falsely aspersed, and afterward accused the King:
and for which calumnies you most unjustly condemned and traitorously murdered
him; your selves being most truly and notoriously guilty of that, for which you
wickedly, cruelly and injustly destroyed your and our King. Shall you escape
the righteous judgment of God? Will not God visit you for these things? shall
he not be avenged of such (...) Hypocrites?

^or is it without a special Providence, that you should be left wholly naked
and d^stitute of all pretended du^ Authority in the fulfilling your ex^crable
vill^nies, to which you would now fain invite the people of England, not having
any show or color of any Parliamentary Votes, Authority, ^r Commands to
countenance ^our mischiefs, murthe^s, and tyran^^^s, not any concurrence of
either Lords or Commons; whom now under force, and without all freedom
(becoming either Gentlemen or Christians) we must tell you, we look upon as no
House; and their enforced or enslaved Votes as null; their after sittings and
complyings with you, being nothing but infamous and base prostitutings of the
Honor of that House, and Vassallatings of the Dignity and Liberty both of the
Parliament and People of England, to the Tyranny of a few Mutinous Cutthroats,
Traiterous Rebels, and bloody Schismatics; who are in no sense to be counted
the People of England; any more then Scabs, or Plague-sores, or Leprosy, or
putid Ulcers, and noisome Excrements are to be ^^puted any part of the Body,
whose grief, burden and annoyance they are.

So that unless you can flatter your selves to have done well and worthily in
all you have cru^lly, insolently and traiterou^ly acted against King, Lo^ds,
Commons, Gentry, Clergy and all honest men.

Unless you can propound something to recompense the inestimable Injuries you
have done to all Estates in these three Kingdoms, as in other acts of your
Tyranny and Treason, so chiefly in that unparalled Villainy of Murdering such
a King, and depriving us of so Incomparable a Prince, for Wisdom, Piety,
Gravity, Patience, Magnanimity, Courage, Constancy, Charity, and all other
Virtues most adorning a Man a King and a Christian (the loss of whom all (...)
lives of you and your Approvers cannot countervayl or expiate, being but as so
many Dogs heads to such a Boon.)

Unless you can stop the Mouths of all men, or cut their Throats, or sea^
their Consciences, or persuade them to damn their Souls, for your sakes to
gratify a few C^uterised Consciences, bloody and ambitious spirits among you.

You cannot but hear the sound of much Vengeance coming upon you, to which your
own black Souls summon you, and which your own Consciences will in the first
place silently, but yet severely execute upon you.

Nor will your Seeming Smiles, and forced confidences, nor yet the Applauses of
your sordid Flatterers, and desperate Confederates, nor yet the assistance of
your numerous and deluded Soldiers, be able to exempt you from that storm of
fire and Brimstone, that pit, s^are, Curse and Hell, which pursues you, and is
ready to overtake you.

How can such Zimri's, who have so traitorously slain such a King, their Lord
and Master, ever hope to have peace or impunity in this or the other World?
Since the Justice of Divine Providence (in a Case where his Name was not
blasphemed, and so his glory not so concerned as in this, (of your murdering
so lawful and so Christian a King) suffered not any of the Murderers of
Julius Caesar, who was but an Usurper, to die other then a violent and immature
death. Nor will (we hope) our Solomon by Gods blessing and his Subjects
assistance, suffer the Hairy Scalps of those who were the chief Counselors and
Actors in destroying his dear Father, and our Dread Sovereign, to go down to
the Grave in peace, or to dye a dry death; who have shed the blood of War,
in a time when all Differences were by a Treaty drawn to a Peace and Union.

We can never think, that a Babell of so confused a fashion, of such a headlong
height, as yours is; such a Toads-stool suddenly grown out of the Earth of
Beggary and Ignorance, by Fraud and Cruelty, lately watered with the blood of
the King and his Subjects, can long thrive or stand; having no foundation in
the world, or any show of reason, equity, honor, peace, liberty or piety to
support it. Not any seeming Authority (for due and legal you could have none
upon Earth.) Not any general desire, delight, consent or Agreement, in what
you have done, or propound further to do; but rather a general detestation,
an utter abhorrence, and a perfect hatred of you and your deeds; which honest
men will then agree to, and subscribe, when they can be content to love Death
and Hell, or to hate God and their own Souls.

Nor doubt we, but many of those Soldiers, whose valor and simplicity you have
thus far grossly abused by engaging them in such desperate assistances
(whose profit will redound to but few or none of them,) when their Christian,
penitent and smiteing hearts shall come to see (as no doub^ many of them
already do, who are not thoroughly poisoned with your desperate Principles) to
what horrid Villainies they are made Gossips and accessory by your Fraud and
Hypocrisy, they will speedily return from you, dead Dogs, desperate Sheba's,
and cursing Shimei's; whose mouths and hearts are full of the gall of
bitterness, whose hands and feet are swift to shed blood, who know not the way
of Peace, nor have any fear of God before your eyes; whose Curse is to boast
your selves in your iniquity; to fall from one wickedness to another, till
eternal vengeance seize upon you.

Penitently smiting their breasts, as those that came from crucifying Christ
Jesus, (a work proportionate to the malice and cruelty of you our Kings
Murderers, our Barabbasses) whose barbarity has at once deprived the King of
what is wont to be dearest to men, his Life and his Kingdoms; robbing his
Subjects, the Christian World, and all Mankind, of the greatest glory, and
most Illustrious example of Virtue and Piety that ever sat upon a Christian
Throne; the most unspotted person, the wisest ^rince, the most Charitable
Christian, the most imitable pattern for moderation in Prosperity, for patience
in Adversity, for devout humility toward God, f^r judicious zeal to true
Religion, for constant love to the Church, for winning Majesty upon all men,
that ever swayed the Scepter of this or any other Kingdom; Accessible in his
brightest splendour, Magnanimous in his greatest Diminutions; of a thriving and
victorious virtue under the heavyest pressures and Crosses; w^ose excellent
skill was never so much discovered as in the late storms; whose darknings
rendered him not less formidable to his Enemies, or less venerable to his
Friends^ nor was he ever more terrible to those, that are perfect haters of
God, of Him, and of all Goodness than when they saw, that the eminency of his
Virtues was not to be smothered by their Calumnious Expressions; but the beams
and luster of Divine Majesty in him daily conquered all Eclipsings that either
his own misfortunes or your malice cast upon him.

This was the Man, this the Christian, this the King, this the Saint, this the
Martyr, whom these Judas's have betrayed, these ^ewes destroyed, these
Canniballs devoured.

A sin questionless exceeding in many respects that of Christ's Crucifiers,
(not as to the dignity of the person, wherein Christ infinitely surpassed the
Majesty as well as merit of all Earthly Kings) but as to that eminency of Civil
Dignity and Sovereignty, wherewith the King from God was invested; which Christ
Jesus never assumed, contenting himself with the form of a servant, and
subjecting h^mself to Civil Magistracy. Also in regard of that malice,
hypocrisy and pretenslesse Cruelty, which these Monsters showed against the
King, destitue of any show of Due Authority; which the Crucifiers of our
Savior wanted not; urging also a Law they had, by which they said, (though
falsely) he ought to dye: What Law the Kings Murderers either produced or
pretended to justify their Authority, their Accusations, or their Sentence
against, and Execution upon the King, we and they are yet to learn; nor is it
possible they ever should; since all^ our Laws do most fully and cleary
declare the person of the King, as Supreme, Sacred, Unaccountable, Inviolable
by any Person, Process, Judgment or Punishment on Earth.

When the Soldiery by Sea and Land shall once seriously reflect upon and
consider the infinite odious aggravations, wherewith this horrid Murder of
such a Man, such a Prince, and their lawful King, is laden (to which Villainy,
their Valor was abused, to be only as Bloodhounds, Butchers, and Hang-men) no
doubt they will conceive so just and generous a disdain, that no men's hands
will be more ready to avenge their own dishonor, the shame of their
Profession, the wound and stayn of their Consciences, the Blood of their King,
the Dignity of Parliaments, and the Loyalty of their Nation, (never so branded
in any fo^mer age) than those Soldiers, whose Valor you the Achitophels,
Jeroboams, Hamans and Ma^hiavels of our times have basely abused, only to serve
you in accomplishing your Execrable Villainies, and to preserve you from just
and speedy Vengeance; which (as Severus said to those Villanes and Traitors,
who had murdered their Emperor Pertinax) can neither be invented for you, nor
executed upon you, proportionable to the many and Outrageous Villainies
committed by you.

We the People of England, cannot but appeal to God, your own Consciences,
(such as they are, cauterised and polluted with the Blood of our King) also to
the judgment of all men, that have but common sober sense, Whether any Age, any
Monuments of former times, any History of humane Affairs, have ever recorded
any excess of Riot, any superfluity of Wickedness to have ever flowed from
the hearts of any men, or have been f^lfilled parallel to yours? Whether any
Combination of desperate men, filled with the Quintessence of all wickedness,
fraught with flattery, cruelty, hypocrisy, tyranny, and all degrees of
malicious Villainy, incident to humane nature, have since the world began, and
Mankind has been planted upon the Earth, ever committed the like Villainies
(which exceed all names of Vice and Infamy) or ever more deserved to be made a
public Curse, and universal Execration to all Mankind, to have their persons
cut off from the face of the Earth, and buried with the burial of an Ass; to
have their Posterity, as a pes^ilent Progeny spewed out of the Land, (unless
they fully declare their unfeigned and utter abhorrence of their Fathers
Villainies, who have defiled the Land with the blood of the King;) That their
Houses ^which are neither great nor many) may be rased; that their memories may
be blotted out from under Heaven, or only remembered with perpetual scorn,
cursing and infamy.

Since they have besides many other preparatory mischiefs, by murdering the
King, disinheriting his Posterity, and dissolving this ancient and flourishing
Monarchy, (as far as lies in their power and malice) put us upon this
miserable choice; Either cowardly, basely and shamefully to submit to their
detestable and unsatiable Tyranny; or to be ever oppressed with a War in our
own bowels; in which we must either expose our Lives and Fortunes to these men's
covetous Cruelty, or help to enslave and destroy our selves by assisting these
Usurpers; or compel the Rightful Heir of these Kingdoms, our hopeful King
CHARLES the Second, to plead and assert his Right by a Forain Sword; being
denied that just assistance, which as his Subjects we ought to afford him
against the Murderers of his and our Countries Father; his own Enemies, and
indeed of all Kingly Majesty, and Mankind; the Dissolvers of our ^arliaments,
the Oppressors of our Liberties, the Exhausters of our Estates, the Suckers of
our Blood, the Blasphemers of our Religion, the Damners of our Souls (unless
God preserve us,) the Crucifiers afresh of the Lord of Glory, and putting him
to open shame.

The Cry of the blood of our King, the Voice of the Genius of this Nation, and
the Alarm of Gods Justice, call aloud to all honest men of Foreign Nations
round about; to all loyal Subjects in these three Kingdoms, to all men of any
common honesty or sober profession of Religion in all the world; summoning them
to san^^ifie themselves, and lustrate and expiate not only this English Nation
and these three Kingdoms, but all Mankind, and Civil Societies, by taking
speedy vengeance, and executing Gods and Man's severest Justice on these
per^idious Truce Breakers, proud Usurpers, cruel Hypocrites, traiterous
Apostates, and barbarous King-killers.

We cannot but send the divided parts of our dead but endeared King, now a
glorious Saint, (whom these men have with subtilty and cruelty lately
murdered) to all the Tribes of this our Israel, to desire the advice of all
good men, to see and consider, whether this hideous Villainy were committed with
their consent, or deserve to be patronized with their Agreement; whether it was
ever thus done in any Christian Nation or Kingdom, by any Army of pretending
Saints, or any men, we say not of Common Honesty, but of the most exquisite and
studied Villainy: Whether any thing can be produced out of Common Principles of
sound Reason, out of the Laws of God, out of Christ's Holy Precepts, out of the
Actions and Examples of any holy and good men; or lastly, out of any letter,
sense or meaning of our Laws, whereby in the least degree to countenance,
cover or excuse the Actions of these men; or to satisfy any man's Conscience,
that does not utterly abhor and seriously endeavor to expiate the sin and
guilt of such Detestable Villainies.

According to the heaped and overrunning measure of their open sins, and
abominable Villainies, so let every good man, that fears God, knows the Memory
and Virtues of so good a King, loves his Country, will keep a good Conscience,
and desires to save his own Soul, not only withdraw all voluntary assistance
from them, least they seem approvers of their wicked Deeds, and be partakers of
their Guilt and Judgments; but heartily pray, and constantly endeavor the
Restoring of the Crowns and Kingdoms to the only Lawful Heir, the late Kings
Eldest Son, upon whom are many happy Presages, and great Expectations of
Glorious Achievements; whom God has in Mercy, we hope, to these Churches and
Kingdoms, preserved out of the hands of these bloody Villains, who Declared in
their Devilish Remonstrance, their purpose to destroy him, with his Brother the
Duke of York, and mingle their tender bloods with that of their Father; whom
special Providence has prepared for great and excellent Designs, by the
maturity of his years, by the procerity of his person, by the gallantry of his
Spirit, by the excellency of his Understanding, by the gravity of his Manners,
and severity of his Example, far beyond what is wonted or expected in young
Men, or young Princes in point of Piety and Virtue.

This is that Person, this that Prince, worthy of his high Descent, worthy of
such a Father, whose worth already promises to exceed all you can desire or
hope for from a Good and Gracious King; upon him God, and our Laws, and our
Oaths, commands all Loyal and Religious Subjects to fix their Eyes, to unite
their Hearts and Hands to the Love and Assistance of him, to expiate the sin
and shame of their former Errors and Defaults, which have produced such sad and
abhorred Effects; to break the Strength, to extirpate the Persons, to oppose
the Designs, and to revenge the Villainies, which have been with an high hand
committed against God, the King, the Parliament, the Laws, and the Kingdoms,
by these Miscreants, men always of Desperate Fortunes, but now of so Desperate
Minds and Manners, that all their paths lead to the Chambers of Death, and
their steps are descending to the pit of Hell.

From which the Lord in Mercy deliver the people of this Nation, by prospering
our Rightful (...) and by his Valor and Virtues, r^deeming us speedily from
the sins, sufferings and tyrannies of these blood-thirsty and deceitful men;
with whom no Agreement can be made by any man, who does not desperately resolve
to sin against the Holy Ghost, and eternally damn his own Soul.
