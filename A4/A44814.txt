To Thee OLIVER CROMWELL.
WHen thou wast a Soldier for the Lord, thou wast low, and little in thine own
eyes; then thou remembredst the Lord, and stood in his fear, and he was thy
strength; but now thou art in thy own strength, and have forgot that time: I
say, thou have denied the Lord God, and thy own law with the pride of thy own
heart; and the pride of thy heart is now acting all manner of cruelty against
them who are in the fear of the Lord.

When thou wast low, the Lord was thy strength, but now thou have departed from
him, and thy strength is in man; thou have trusted in the arm of flesh, and not
in God; thou have chosen the glory of this world, and art as a stinking dunghill
in the sight of God; thou have shut thy self out of the kingdom, and them who
are in the kingdom, all manner of evil is done and acted to them in thy name;
and so thou have strengthened all the wicked, and in stead of serving the Lord,
thou have served thy own glory, and thy own pleasures, and thou art going on in
all thy power; but verily him whom thou once served, which thou now art turned
from, he will overtake thee, for thou have almost filled up thy measure; many
fair things have thou promised to them whom the Lord is their strength, but
they see thee, and all thy subtilty: For verily, have not thou suffered in thy
name (whose name is Oliver Lord Protector) many bloody actions to be done in
thy name? And he that protects thee now is unrighteous Mammon, and so him that
is our Protector will rule thee, to him must thou bow, for verily the law of
God shall overturn thee: And when thou have filled up thy measure in thy cruel
bloody actions, who have suffered the innocent to be persecuted, yea unto
death; and some has suffered stoning and sore bruising.

Therefore in the name of the Lord God, whom we serve, and whom once thou
trustedst in, verily, I say unto thee, thy condition above all men is most
lamentable; for them who are born again, and witness a new birth in him, whom
we receive tribute from; we are all soldiers against all sin and deceit, and
have overcome death, hell, and the grave; and being of them who partake of the
Resurrection of Christ, the second death has no power over. And so in the
power of God we all stand to follow the Lamb wherever he goes, and so we
follow the Lord in the new generation. But I say unto thee, thou have forgot
thy promise, and what the Lord did for thee, when he gave thee victory over
unreasonable men.

Woe is me for thee, that ever thou should depart from that of God that was
once in thee, and have trusted in the arm of flesh, and so thou art one with
them whom once thou foughtest against! For there is that in thy conscience will
let thee see thou art one with a proud man, one with a drunken man, one with a
covetous man, and one with all them that are in the evil, the light in thy
conscience will let thee see all these things; for verily, that in thee which
should have brought forth fruit unto God, has brought forth nothing but wild
grapes, brambles, briers, and thorns; and Crown (...) which thou have now is
nothing but thorns.

Oh! thou had better had the Angels to have guarded thee, and the Lord to
have protected thee, then to have trusted in the arm of flesh.

For verily his Son is brought forth in them who have believed in his name, and
all the Angels shall worship him: But thou have crucified the Son of God, and
have chosen thy own way, and thy own strength, and thou art one with all them
who are set against Christ; for verily I say unto thee, he will overtake thee
when thou have filled up thy measure; for he who is Lord of heaven and earth,
is ready to deliver thee into the hands of thy enemies within and without; for
I say unto thee, thy way is now darkness, and thou have turned thy back on him
who is all our strength and light, in whose strength, I tell thee, thou have
even owned him who is the god of this world, and the glory of the world is thy
portion and delight, and that which is of another world is crucified by thee.

Oh! my heart is sad for thee, that ever thou should be found where thou
art; many true messengers the Lord has sent to thee for the good of thy soul;
but thou would not lend thy ears to them, and so thou must have no peace
with them; for them who would have loved thy soul, thou would not hear, and
the soul is more worth then the glory of this world. But verily thou must have
thy portion amongst them who are in their own glory; for we who know the Lord,
and have found him whom our souls loved, our glory is not of this world, nor in
our own glory, nor in our own strength, but in the Lord our God, who is our
glory, and has crowned us with his everlasting glory, and we stand in his
glory, and in his power, and so we stand in the righteousness of God, who has
brought us into the innocence, and in that we know our being and our
habitation with the Lord, and with him to reign for evermore; for them who
suffer with him shall reign with him. But thou, where thou stand, thy reign
shall be but for a time, for misery and great condemnation shall be thy
portion, and all them who have forgotten the Lord our God; for we have the Lord
to be our strength, and thou who acts against him, the time is come that we are
justified, and with him that justifies us shall thou be condemned, and thou
shall know that thou had better that thy tongue had been cloven to the roof
of thy mouth, ere these things had been acted in thy name (we are kept in
perfect peace) And them who have suffered to death in prison, their blood, yea
the blood of the innocent sha^^ be required of thee, whom the Lord set in the
place, but thou have departed from that place; and so thou do not, nor can
not bear rule for God, but against him; but he is coming upon thee, whom thou
have acted against, which thou shall know, and all thy gallant glory will he
bring down; for no flesh shall glory in his presence, for dreadful will he be
to thy glory, even him whom thou have crucified, the Lamb slain from the
foundation of the world: I say unto thee in the name of the Lord, whom we all
know, and for whom we are a witness against thee, this shall witness for us;
for thou must have condemnation with the light which thou have turned from,
which witness is in thy conscience, which thou once wast in, and heard speak,
and breathed after the Lord, and many dear servants of God have warned thee of
thy earthly glory; the Lord did send me once before now to thee, for the good
of thy soul, and I could have done any thing once for thee, for the seeds sake,
that thou might have known the way of truth; but thou have counted us all of
small worth.

Woe is me for thee, that thou can not see him whom thou have pierced, nor
can lay it to heart what thou have done.

I told thee once before, that thou had crucified the Lamb of God, and
trodden the blood of the new Covenant under thy feet, and counted it a vain
thing: Thou askedst me once what it was; and I told thee the blood of Christ
cleansed from all sin, and his water washed, and his Spirit made alive; but
thou could not receive these things, for all the cry that thou could hear
which was in thee; for verily I say, thou could not hear, but have hardened
thy heart; for the righteous has cried to thee for righteousness sake but it
could not be heard, neither in thy self, nor in others; and all that ever thou
did do for God is now in vain, for thou have now chosen thy own way, and so
the cry could never be heard, how the righteous has cried for righteousness
sake, that they might have had Justice in the Land, that many a one might have
worshipped God without any disturbance.

Thou have suffered thy soldiers, which are in the abomination with thy self,
to disturb peaceable meetings, and to hale men to prison: Thou have many
colors for thy deceit, but thou have none for these men which were met
peaceably together; for violently they came amongst them with their horses, and
acted violently, by treading amongst simple and harmless people.

Oh! what shameless things are done in thy name, and by thy authority? yea
verily the righteous spirit of God is grieved with thee: And all these things
shall thou know; for all the cunning and subtilties of thy heart is seen and
known by them who are come into the everlasting spirit: And when thou give
account or all those actions which have been acted by thee, and in thy name,
and by thy power, oh what a day will it be with thee! For as my soul lives,
these things shall be laid all to thy charge: And for us, whom the Lord has
redeemed from the vainglory of the world, and has graffed us into himself, he
will plead our cause, yea the righteous cause of himself, and he will make thee
an example to all great ones in the world; and when that day comes upon thee,
thou shall me remember, that thou wast warned of all thy evil

By a Lover of thy soul, whose name in the flesh is MARY HOWGILL
This in one of its first Copies was delivered to Oliver Cromwels own hands by
the Author her self, at or about the eighth day of the fourth month 1656.
about ten a clock at night, with whom thereupon she had much discourse.



TO all you Disputers at Dover, and all other Towns in the County of Kent, who,
some of you, would have a threefold Light, and you are disputing with that
which is darkness; neither can you come to the true Light which is in God,
because you are shut up in darkness, and cannot understand the things of God,
but by your darkness and disputings calls good evil, and evil good: How is it
that you refrain in darkness, but because you hate the Light which should bring
you out of darkness. And you Anabaptists, who have another color, a finer
color for deceit then the Priests of England have, a greater abomination to
the Lord* in the Light of the Lord you are seen and discovered; you who have
^^^sed your selves up in that great abomination, which is fornication, you are
found in Idolatry, and the mother of that Idolatry is a whore; You who are
contending about Water Baptism, I say, in the Lords Light you and your Baptism
is seen by them who are baptized with the true spiritual Baptism, which is, to
be baptized with Fire and the Holy Ghost, by one death into one body, which
joins to the Lord; and they are not they which joins to the Harlot, nor to the
Whore, but they are joined through the death by the Word of God, which baptized
into the death, and that Baptism takes sin away: But see what your outward
elementary Water Baptism has done for you, or what it will, or is able to do
for you; you who live in pride and envy, persecuting them who are born again by
the word of God, which leads into the Spirit of God; your gay and glorious
clothing, its of your selves, and of the whorish woman, which has the cup of
abomination in her hand, and you are found in an ill smell, stinking in the
nostrils of God: Some of you, I say, are digging and pruning; some of you with
your Water Baptism, and some of you eating bread and drinking wine, and say it
is a command of God; but the time is come that your outward Water Baptism, and
Eating and Drinking is seen, and in the light of the Lord you are weighed and
tried in the even balance, and you are all found too light, and with the Light
are to be condemned; a day of terror will overtake you; a day of sorrow, and
all your gallant flesh shall come down, and you shall be laid waste, all you who
have exalted your selves by your own works; it is your own works, and your own
ordinances, which has shut you of the Kingdom of God, and the fear of God you
have lost, and are out of the cross of Christ, which you do not know, but have
it left behind you, and so the Lord God is coming to make waste all you
builders of this County of Kent, the Lord God is coming to reckon with you, a
day of thunder shall come upon you, and that speedily, which will make your
works abomination, for I say you of all people are most lamentable, the
righteous Spirit of God is grieved with you, the seed of God is slain by you,
which is the seed of the Son, yea the righteous blood is trodden down by you,
and that blood are we cleansed by, which is the blood of the Lamb, and them who
drink of it, it takes away all guilt of sin, and there is no sin remaining
where guilt is taken away; the Son of God has redeemed us from all evil, and
there is no evil in them who are in the Son; the Angel is flying through heaven
with the everlasting Gospel, and you who will be washed by outward water see
now your blindness; and you who are raking in the Scriptures to find the way to
God out, I say you shall not find it there, nor the word of God is not there,
for the word of God, which was in the beginning, we who have found it, by it we
were led into the way; God and his Word is one, and by his Word we were
wounded, and it laid desolate all our own buildings, and by the word of God the
Son of God was redeemed, and the true faith in God was witnessed, and that
which gave victory over the world is God, and the Word and he (...) and so we
witness the Scripture fulfilled in us: And some of you asks questions,
whether the reading of the Scripture is of none effect to them who are in the
fall? I answer, you have made them of none effect by your (...) fallen wisdom,
with your pride, who live in all manner of evil, and in the earthly nature, who
with the earthly nature crucifies him who gave the Scripture forth; for he gave
it forth for a true declaration of the Light, Life, and Way to the Father,
which Light, Life, and Way, are the true way to walk by; and you live in all
manner of evil, you do not walk according to it, but contrary to it, and so to
you it is of none effect; for it is theirs who are learned of the Lord, and are
in his fear, they are the Lords, and the Scripture is theirs as they witness
them; and the Lord God is ^^^^ming to take vengeance upon you, who will not be
warned; yea, I say, he will make you all afraid at his coming, and he will
silence all you vain d^sputers; a day of vengeance is coming upon you, the
fierce indignation (...) the Lord shall overtake you, because of your
abominations; for your a^^^minations are so great, that the innocence of God
is lost by them, and ^he Lord God is coming to take hold of you all, yea all of
you filthy and ^roud Sodomites, who are found in the evil, your gold rings, and
counterfit jewels shall be pulled off, for your jewels are not the true jewels
of God: And you who say the Lord will have a willing people, you are ^^ling to
the God you serve, even the Prince of the Air; your jewels, (...) your
willingness, and your filthy garments inwardly and outwardly, the Lord God will
destroy, the Lord God will have his own in you, he is appearing, which is
stronger then the man of sin in you; a warning to all sorts of Profession which
has no possession, but has lost the fear of God; he who is the Possession,
and the Substance, and Life, and Light, with it you shall be condemed, and then
you shall remember your abominations; the Land shall mourn no longer by you;
the Lord God with h^s pure righteous Law shall take hold of you, and he shall
ease the creation of you; you who have cumbred the ground so long, and have
been unfruitful, you have dishonored your Head, but he who is Head over heaven
and earth, I te^l you, will (...) down all fruitless trees, and throw them into
the fire, and so he will have his own: And you are all hereby warned of your
evil, and all your profession will be in vain to you at that day; for the Lord
God is righteous, and you unrighteous ones shall me remember that you were
warned of all your evil, that you may return while you have time to return; the
Law of God shall take hold on you, and the coming of the Son of man shall be
like the roaring of a lion; the lions and the bears shall roar, and the earth
shall pass away with a great noise; he shall come upon you suddenly, and the
end of your work shall be destruction, the power of the Son of God shall all
your works destroy.

Given forth by the Spirit of the Lord against all deceit 7. day the 5. month,
1656. By a true lover of all your souls, who has a new name given from above,
which is not earthly nor carnal as yours are, though (...) the outward called
MARY HOUGHIL.
