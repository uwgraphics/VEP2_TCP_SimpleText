By the Lord Lieutenant AND COUNCIL.
J. ROBERTS.

WHereas several Rolls Inquisitions and other matters of Record which concern
His Majesty's Lordships, Manors, Lands, Tenements and Hereditaments within
this Kingdom and the Royalties and Revenues belonging to His Crown, and several
other Records relating to the Subjects of this Kingdom have been imbezelled,
and taken out of the Tower called Berminghams Tower in His Majesty's Castle of
Dublin, to the great prejudice of His Majesty and His good Subjects, whose
quiet and Settlement are much concerned therein,

We have therefore thought fit by this Proclamation in His Majesty's name
strictly to charge and command all manner of persons who have any of the said
Rolls, Inquisitions or Records in their custody, or can come by any of them
that they do bring the same in, and deliver them into the hands of Sir William
Domvile Knight His Majesty's Attorney General within the space of three months
from and after the date of this Proclamation; And in case any person or persons
do know where, or in whose hands; custody or possession, any of the said
Rolls, Inquisitions or Records are, that they give notice thereof to His
Majesty's said Attorney General, within one month after the date hereof; And
of this our Proclamation we require all persons concerned to take notice and
duly observe the same, as they will answer the contrary at their utmost perils.

Given at the Council Chamber in Dublin the first day of October 1669. Ja.
