the West End of St. Paul's. 1685.

THE Preface.
THe Courtiers Manual Oracle, which is here presented to the Reader, as it is
an abridgment of all the works of that judicious and learned Spaniard Baltazar
Gracian; so it carries in its own Title an abridgment of it self, as not only
pointing at the subject it treats of, but also the persons for whose use it is
designed.

Oracles are the glimmerings of a supernatural light, which do rather dazzle
than illuminate those who are not both attentive, and sharp sighted: And
therefore the Maxims which here bear that name, are not calculated for all
degrees of Men, nor for all sorts of Understandings. There is an art of short
speaking, no less than that of short handwriting, and both are obscure, but to
the intelligent and thinking, who may draw considerable advantage from both.
It Is an old saying; A word's enough to the Wise; and he that cannot crack the
shell, and taste the kernel of a sentence, though he may be wise in his own
Eyes, will never be reckoned so in the judgment of Sages. A Proverb patly
applied and well understood, makes a deeper impression upon the minds of
understanding men, than a lank declamation adorned with all the Posies and
Flowers of Rhetoric. This made the learned and discerning Author affect a
certain vigorous laconicism in all his writings, that made him highly esteemed
by the greatest men of his own Country, and of Strangers also who understood
his language, though the French Author Des Entretiens d' Ariste and Eugene, a
leading Critic accounts him unintelligible, and by consequent untranslateable;
but whether he be so or not in this translation, it is left to the judgment of
the Reader.

It may be made a Problem, perhaps, by some, whether The Art of Prudence, be
at this time seasonably or not translated and published in English; seeing to
instruct and not to instruct, has great affinity with the answering and not
answering a fool in his folly, according to Solomon, and all the World are
satisfied, that there is a vast number of more than ordinary fools, and mad men
amongst us at present. The title and design of the Book, I think, may salve the
doubt; for it is the Courtiers Manual Oracle, not of him only who has the
honor to be actually in that station; but of others also, who by knowing, and
reflecting upon the transactions of the world, may be capable, if not to serve
the Public, yet to live like men in their generation, and to such it cannot be
unseasonable, if they have the ingenuity to act according to its maxims,
seeing in so doing they will find by experience, that when once the ground is
well known, one may hit the Jack with a Boul that runs straight, if it be their
custom to bowl so, as well as with that which fetches the greatest compass by
its biass; and that a man may be a Politician successfully, and with applause,
without forsaking the rational Rules of Morality and Religion, for the
deceitful Sophistry of Cunning and Artisice, which commonly soon or too late
shows its own perniciousness by the fatal disappointments of those that
practice it. For the unintelligent and headstrong Mobile, that makes the
greatest part of Mankind, they have nothing to do with this Book; Odi profanum
vulgus and arceo: The Author wrote not for them, well knowing that their
inveterate folly is not to be cured but restrained; and that as it is very
easy by force of words and long-winded Cant, to preach them out of their
senses, so it is as impossible by short documents to sentence them into their
Wits and good Manners again, as to cure a Chronical Hypochondriarcy by an
Aphorism of Hippocrates, or a spell of Seneca's or Plutarch's Morals. To these
Animals then for whom the Bit and Bridle is designed, the Discipline of the
Whip is the best Doctrine, and nothing of this nature can be seasonable or
unseasonable, but as it may influence those of the smaller number, who are
their Riders, and spur them at their pleasure; Now if these be so mad as to run
upon precipices, and ride over Rocks, those Maxims can in this only be
unseasonable; that they seasonably taught them, what too late, and unseasonably
they were convinced of.

Every thing is now at the point of its perfection, and an able Man at the
highest pitch thereof.
THERE goes more to the making up of one Wise Man now a days, than in Ancient
Times of seven: And at present there is more sense required for treating with
one single Person, than heretofore with a whole Nation.

MAXIM II.
Wit and a Genius
Are two Qualities wherein the Capacity of a Man consists. To have one without
the other, is to be happy but by halves. It is not enough to have a good
understanding, there must be a Genius also to accompany it. It is commonly the
ill luck of weak or awkward People to be mistaken in the choice of their
Profession, of their Friends, and of the place of their Residence.

MAXIM III.
Not to be too free, nor open.
It is the Admiration of Novelty that makes events to be valued. There is
neither pleasure nor profit in playing ones Game too openly. Not to declare
immediately, is the way to hold minds in suspense, especially in matters of
importance, which are the object of universal expectation. That makes every
thing to be thought a mystery, and the secret of that raises veneration. In the
manner of expression one ought to have a care not to be too plain: and to speak
with open heart is not always convenient in conversation. Silence is the
Sanctuary of Prudence. A resolution made manifest was never esteemed. He that
declares himself, is obnoxious to Censure: and if he succeeds not, he is doubly
miserable. We ought then to imitate the method of God Almighty, who always
holds men in suspense.

MAXIM IV.
Knowledge and Valor club to the making of great Men.
These are two qualities which render Men immortal, because they themselves are
so. No man is great but in so far as he knows: and when he knows, he can do
all things. Man that knows nothing, is the World in darkness. Prudence and
Strength are his Eyes and Hands. Knowledge is barren, if Valor do'nt accompany
it.

MAXIM V.
To be always useful.
It is not the Guilder but the Adorer that makes the God. A Man of Parts had
rather meet with those who depend upon him, than that are thankful to him. To
keep People in hope, is Civility; to trust to their Gratitude, Simplicity. For
it is as common for Gratitude to be forgetful, as for Hope to be mindful. You
get always more by this, than by the other. When one has once drank, he turns
his back upon the Well: so soon as the Orange is squeezed, it is thrown upon the
ground, When Dependence cease, there is an end of Correspondence, and of
Esteem also. It is therefore a lesson of Experience, that a Man ought to
endeavor always to render himself useful, nay even to his Prince; though he
must not affect an excess of silence, to make others overshoot themselves, nor
for his own interest render another man's evil incurable.

MAXIM VI.
Man at the height of his perfection.
He is not born complete; but daily improves in his Manners and Employment,
until at length he arrive at the point of Consummation. Now these are the
marks by which we may know an accomplished Man: a quaint perception, readiness
in discerning, solidity of judgment, tractableness of will, and circumspection
in words and actions. Some never attain to that pitch, there is somewhat always
wanting: and others arrive at it, but late.

MAXIM VII.
To have a care not to outdoe ones Master.
All Superiority is odious, but in a Subject over his Prince, it is ever
foolish, or fatal. An accomplished man conceals vulgar advantages, as a modest
Woman hides her Beauty under a negligent dress. There are many who will yield
in good fortune, or in good humor; but no body will yield in Wit, and least of
all a Sovereign. Wit is the King of Attributes, and by consequent, every
Offense against it, is no less a Crime than Treason. Sovereigns would be witty
in all things that are most eminent. Princes are willing to be assisted, but
not surpassed. Those who advise them, ought to speak, as if they put them in
mind of what they forgot, and not as teaching them what they knew not. This is
a lesson that the Stars read to us, which though they be the sparkling
Children of the Sun, yet never appear in his presence.

MAXIM VIII.
A Man never taken in passion
Is a mark of the sublimest reach of wit, seeing thereby a man puts himself
above all vulgar impressions. It is the greatest of Dominions to rule ones self
and passions. That is the triumph of free will.) If passion ever seize the
mind, let it be without prejudice to our employment, especially if it be
considerable. That Is the way to prevent much vexation, and to gain a high
reputation.

MAXIM IX.
To falsify the defects of ones Nation.
Water imbibes the good or bad qualities of the Minerals through which it
passes, and Man those of the Climates where he is born. Some are more obliged
than others to their Country, in that they have met with a more favorable
constellation in it. There is no Nation how Polite soever, but has some
original failing, which their Neighbors, either out of caution or emulation
censure. It is the victory of an able man to correct, or at least belly the
censure of these failings. Thereby one acquires the glorious renown of being
singular, and that exemption from a common fault is the more esteemed, that no
body expects it. There are also Family-defects, defects of Profession,
Employment and Age, which concurring all together in one and the same subject,
render it an unsupportable Monster, if they be not timely prevented.

MAXIM X.
Fortune and Renown.
The one is as fickle, as the other firm and constant. The first serves during
life, and the other after death. The one resists Envy, and the other Oblivion.
Fortune is courted, and sometimes obtained by the help of Friends. Renown is
gained by Industry. The desire of Reputation springs from Virtue. Renown has
been and is the Sister of Giants: it is always upon the extremes either of
Applause or Execration.

MAXIM XI.
To converse with those from whom one may learn.
Familiar Conversation ought to be the School of Learning and breeding. A man
is to make his Masters of his Friends, seasoning the pleasure of conversing
with the profit of instruction. Betwixt Men of Wit the advantage is
reciprocal.) They who speak are rewarded with the applause that is given to
what they say; and those who hear, with the profit they receive from it. Our
own interest inclines us to conversation. A man of sense frequents the company
of good Courtiers, whose Houses are rather the Theaters of Heroism, than the
Palaces of vanity. There are some men who besides their being Oracles
themselves, that instruct others by their Example, are also so happy, that
their Retinue is an Academy of Prudence and Breeding.

MAXIM XII.
Nature and Art: Matter and the Artist.
There is no Beauty without help, nor perfection that is not apt to fall into
barbarity, if Art lend not an helping hand. Art corrects what is bad, and
perfects what is good. Nature commonly denies us the best, to the end we may
have recourse to Art. The best Nature without Art is but a Wilderness: and how
great soever a Man's Talents may be, unless they be cultivated, they are but
half-talents. Without Art a man knows nothing as he ought to do, and is
Clownish in every thing he sets about.)

MAXIM XIII.
To proceed sometimes cunningly, sometimes heartily.
Man's life is a conflict with the malice of man himself. An expert man for
Weapons uses the strategems of intention. He never does what he seems to have a
mind to do. He takes an aim, but that is to deceive the Eyes that look upon
him. He blurts out a word in the air, and then does a thing that no body dreamt
of. If he come out with a saying, it is to amuse the attention of his Rivals,
and whilst that is taken up in considering what he drives at, he presently acts
what never came into their thoughts. He then, that takes heed not to be imposed
upon, prevents the cunning of his Companion by good reflections. He always
understands the contrary of what one would have him to understand, and thereby
he immediately discovers the falsify. He lets the first pass go, and expects
the second or third with a good guard. And when afterward his Artifice is
known, he refines his dissimulation, making use of truth it self to deceive by.
To change his cunning, he changes his ground and battery. His Artifice is to
have no more Art, and all his subtilty is to pass from Dissimulation to
Candor. He, who observes it with a piercing Eye, knowing the Arts of his
Rival, stands upon his guard, and discovers darkness under a veil of light. He
un^^ddles a procedure the more mysterious, that every thing in it is sincere.
And thus the wiles of Pytho engage the candor of Apollo.

MAXIM XIV.
The thing and the manner of the thing.
The substance is not enough, unless it be clothed with its circumstances. An
ill way spoils all, it even disfigures Justice and Reason. On the contrary, a
graceful way supplies all defects, it guilds a denial, sweetens the sharpness
that is in truth, and smooths the wrinkles of old age. The How does much in all
things. A free and disengaged way charms the minds of men, and makes the
complete Ornament of life.

This Maxim is taken out of the third Chapter of the Authors Discreet, Del
modo y Agrado. And seeing that Chapter is very instructive, the Reader, I hope,
will not take it ill to have here an abstract of it.

For this great Precept, says he, Cleobulus got the Reputation of the chief of
the Wise Men. And, indeed, it is the chief of Precepts. But if to teach it was
sufficient for procuring the name of a Wise Man, nay, and of the chief of the
Sages, what rem^ins for him that shall put it in practice? For to know things,
and not to practice them, is not to be a Philosopher but a Grammarian.

In all things the circumstance is as necessary as the substance, nay, and
more. The thing that first presents to us, is not the essence, but the
appearance. By the outside we come to the knowledge of what is within. By the
bark of the manner we discern the fruit of the substance: insomuch that we
judge of Persons whom we know not by their deportment.

The way and manner is that part of merit which most affects the attention. And
seeing it is to be acquired, he that is without it is inexcusable.

Truth has force; Reason authority; and Justice power: but they are without
luster if the graceful way be wanting; as with it every thing is set off with
more advantage. It makes amends for all things, even for the defects of reason;
it guilds slights, paints deformities, hides imperfections, and in a word,
disguises every thing.

Great Zeal in a Minister; Valor in a Commander; learning in a Scholar; Power
in a Prince; are not enough, unless these qualities be accompanied with that
important formality. But it is in no employment more necessary, than in
Sovereign Command. To be humane rather than despotick is in Superiors a
singular way to engage. To see a Prince make Superiority yield to Humanity,
obliges Subjects upon a double account to love him. He must reign in the first
place over the wills of men, and then over the rest. Conciliate to thy self the
good will, and even the applause of all men, if not out of inclination, at
least by art. For they who admire, mind not whether thy way be natural or
adventitious.

There are many things which are worth but little in themselves, and yet are
esteemed for their manner. By the help of that old things become new, and
return into fashion. If the circumstances be of common use, they palliate the
uncouthness of Antiquity. The relish of men advances always, and never recoils.
What is past takes not, and nothing but what is new pleases it. Nevertheless, a
little change may beguile it. Circumstances make things grow young again, they
cure them of the musty scent, and the mouldiness of Too often, which is always
intolerable, and especially in imitations, which can never rise neither to the
height, nor Novelty of the Original.

This is still more obvious to be seen in the functions of the mind. For though
things be very well known, yet they never fail to raise the Appetite, if the
Orator and Historian hit upon a new way of saying or writing them.

When things are exquisite, they cloy not, though they be even seven times
repeated. But though they be not tedious, yet they are not admired. And
therefore it is necessary to season them, otherwise to the end they may excite
attention. Novelty caresses and charms the Palate. And objects are renewed
merely by changing the Ragoe, which is the true art of pleasing.

Two men shall say the very same things, and yet the one shall please, and the
other by the same means offend. So important it is to know the way how! So
useful is a graceful manner, and so hurtful an unseemly! Now if the want of
a manner be so remarkable, what must that be which is actually bad, and
designedly offensive, and especially in those that hold a public Post? Thy
Clownish Air is but a small defect, said a Wise Man, and yet it is enough to
make all people disgust thee. On the contrary, an external agreeableness
promises a suitableness of mind; and beauty vouches for good humor.

The graceful manner so guilds and sets off a No, as to make it more esteemed
than an ill seasoned Yea. It so skilfully sugar's over truths, that they pass
for blandishments: and sometimes when it seems to flatter, it undeceives, by
telling People not what they are, but what they ought to be.

MAXIM XV.
To make use of Auxiliary-wits.
The happiness of great men consists in having witty men about them, who clear
them from the difficulties of ignorance, by disentangling their affairs. To
entertain Wise Men, is a grandeur surpassing the barbarous haughtiness of that
same Tigranes, who prided himself in being served by Kings, whom he had
conquered. It is a new kind of Dominion to make those our Servants by Art, whom
Nature has made our Masters. Man has much to know, and but a short while to
live; and he lives not at all, if he know nothing at all. It is therefore a
singular piece of skill to study without pains, and to learn much, by learning
of all. When that is once done, you shall see a man speak in a public Assembly
with the wit of many; or rather, you hear as many Sages speaking by his mouth,
as have before instructed him. Thus, the labors of others make him pass for an
Oracle, seeing these Sages fit his Lesson for him, and distill into him the
quintessence of their knowledge. After all, let him who cannot have Wisdom for
a Servant, endeavor at least to have it for a Companion.

MAXIM XVI.
Knowledge and a right intention.
Both these together are the source of good successes. A good Understanding
with a bad Will, make a monstrous Marriage. An ill intention is the poison of
Humane life, and is the more mischievous when backed by knowledge. That Is an
unlucky Wit which is employed to do evil. Learning destitute of true judgment
is double folly.)

MAXIM XVII.
Not to follow always one and the same Conduct.
It is good to vary, that you may frustrate the Curiosity, especially of those
who envy you. For if they come to observe an uniformity in your actions, they
will prevent your enterprises, and by consequent make them miscarry.) It is
easy to shoot a Fowl that flies outright, but not a Bird which is irregular
in its flight. Yet it is not good to be always upon the intrigue neither; for
at second bound the cunning will be discovered. Jealousy is upon the watch;
there is much skill required to guard against it. (A cunning Gamester never
plays the Card which his Adversary expects, and far less that which he desires.)

MAXIM XVIII.
Application and Genius.
No body can be eminent without both these. When those two parts concur, they
make a great man. An ordinary Wit that applies it self, goes farther than a
sublime mind without application. Reputation is got by indefatigable labor.
What costs but little, is good for nothing. Some have wanted application even
in the highest employments; so rare a thing it is to force ones Genius. To have
rather be indifferent in a sublime employment, than excellent in an
indifferent, is a desire rendered excusable by Generosity. But he is not to be
pardoned who rests satisfied to be indifferent good in a small employment, when
he might excel in a great. One must have Art and a Genius then, which he is to
complete by application.

MAXIM XIX.
Not to be too much blazed abroad by the noise of Fame.
It is the usual misfortune of every thing that has been much talked of,
always to come short of the perfection that men have imagined to themselves.)
Reality can never equal imagination, seeing it is as difficult to have all
perfections, as it is easy to entertain a notion of them. Since desire is the
Husband of imagination, it always conceives much more of things than they are
in effect. How great soever perfections may be, they never match the Idea of
them. And as men find themselves frustrated of their expectation, so they
undeceive themselves in stead of admiring. Hope always lessens the truth. And
therefore Prudence ought to correct it, by qualifying it so, that the enjoyment
may surpass the desire. Some beginnings of Credit serve to awaken the
Curiosity, but not to endear the object of it. It is most honorable when the
effect exceeds the notion and expectation. This rule holds not good in evil,
wherein exaggeration serves to belie, calumny, and detraction with the greater
applause, by making that appear tolerable which was thought to be abominable.

MAXIM XX.
Every man in his time.
People of extraordinary and eminent merit depend on the Times. All have not
had the Age they deserved, and many who have met with that, have not had the
happiness to make the best of it. Others have been worthy of a better Age;
which is an argument, that every thing that is good, does not always triumph.
Things of this world have their seasons, and that which is most eminent, is
obnoxious to the freakishness of Custom. But it is always the comfort of a
Wise Man, that he is Eternal. For if his own age be ungreatefull to him, those
that come after do him Justice.

MAXIM XXI.
The Art of being happy.
There are rules of good Fortune; and Happiness in regard of a Wise Man is not
always fortuitous. His industry can help it forwards. Some think it enough to
stand at the Gate of Fortune in a good posture, and expect till she open it.
Others do better, and trusting to their confidence or merit advance farther
on, so that by cajoling of Fortune, soon or late they gain her. However,
according to right Philosophy, virtue and application are the only Arbiters of
a man's lot. For as imprudence is the source of all the crosses of life, so
Prudence is the cause of all its happiness.

MAXIM XXII.
The Man that takes.
A gentile Education is the portion of Men of Breeding. The knowledge of the
Affairs of the Time, good sayings spoken to purpose, pleasant ways of doing
things, make the man of fashion: and the more he excells in these things, the
less he holds of the vulgar. Sometimes a sign or gesture makes deeper
impression than all the documents of a severe Master. The art of conversing
has stood in greater stead to some, than the seven liberal Arts all together.

MAXIM XXIII.
To have no blemish.
There is no perfection without an If, or a But. There are but very few that
want faults, either in manners or body. But there are a great many who are vain
of the faults, which it would be easy for them to amend. When we see the
smallest defect in an accomplished man, we say it is pity, because one Cloud is
enough to eclipse all the Sun. These defects are blemishes at which envy
levels. It would be a notable piece of skill to change them into persections,
as Julius Caesar did, who being bald, covered that defect under the shadow of
his Laurels.

MAXIM XXIV.
To moderate ones own imagination.
The true means of living happy, and of being always esteemed Wise, is either
to correct it, or confine it. Otherwise it takes a Tyrannical Empire over us,
and transgressing the limits of speculation, becomes so very absolute, that
life is happy, or miserable, according to the different fancies that it
imprints upon us. For to some it represents nothing but pains and trouble, and
through their folly becomes their Domestic Executioner. Others there are
again, to whom it proposes only pleasures and grandeurs, delighting to divert
them in dreams. And these are the effects of imagination, when not curbed by
reason.

MAXIM XXV.
A good Pryer.
To understand the art of reasoning and discourse, was heretofore the Science
of Sciences: but that alone will not do now adays, we must guess and divine,
and especially if we would undeceive our selves. He that is not a good Pryer
can never be a good Judge. There are Spies over the heart and intentions. The
truths which import us most, are never told us but by halves. A man of Wit must
dive into the meaning of them, checking his credulity in what appears
advantageous, and giving the reins to believe as to that which is odious!

MAXIM XXVI.
To find out the weak side of every one.
That is the art of managing humors, and of gaining our ends upon men. It
depends more upon skill than resolution to know how to win upon the minds of
People. There is no will that has not its predominant passion, and these
passions are different according to the diversity of tempers. All men are
Idolaters: some of honor, others of interest, and most part of their
pleasures. The skill is then, to know aright these Idols, if we would hit the
weak side of those who adore them. He that can do so, has the key of another
man's will.) We must move with the first mover; and that is not always the
higher, but most commonly the lower faculty. For in this world the number of
those who are irregular, is far greater than of those who are not. (We are
first to know the Character of the Person, next feel his Pulse, and then attack
him by his strongest passion, which is his weaker side. That is a sure way to
gain the Party.)

MAXIM XXVII.
To prefer intention before extention.
Perfection consists not in quantity, but in quality. Of all that is very good,
there is always but very little. That whereof there is much, is little
esteemed. And even amongst men Giants pass commonly for real Dwarfs, (some
value Books for their bulk, as if they were made rather to load the Arms than
to exercise the mind.) Extention alone could never exceed mediocrity. And it is
the unhappiness of men that offer at every thing, to excel in nothing, because
they would excel in all. Intention gives an eminent rank, and makes a Hero,
if the matter be sublime.

MAXIM XXVIII.
To have nothing that is vulgar.
He was a man of an excellent discerning, whom it displeased to please many:
Wise Men are never fond of vulgar Applause. There are Camelions of so popular a
palate, that they take more pleasure to suck in a gross air, than to smell the
sweet Zephyres of Apollo. Be not dazzled at the sight of the miracles of the
vulgar. Ignorants are always in a maze. That which makes the folly of the
mobile admire, undeceives the discerning of the Wise.

MAXIM. XXIX.
The upright Man.
One ought always to be on the side of Reason, and that so constantly, that
neither vulgar passion, nor any tyrannical violence may be able to make him
abandon the party. But where is that Phoenix of equity to be found? Sure, she
has not many Adherents. There are many who publish her praises, but will not
admit her into their Houses. Others follow her as far as danger will permit;
but when they come to that, some like salse Friends deny her; and the rest,
like Politicians, pretend they know her not. She, on the contrary, scruples not
to fall out with Friends, with Powers, nay, and with her own interest: and
there lies the danger of mistaking her. The cunning stand neuter, and by a
plausible and metaphysical subtilty, endeavor to reconcile their Conscience
with reason of state. But an upright man looks upon that way of trimming as a
kind of Treason, thinking it more honor to be constant, than to be a
Statesman. He is always where truth is: and if he sometimes leave people, it is
not that he is fickle, but because they have first forsaken reason.

MAXIM XXX.
Not to affect extraordinary, nor yet Chimerical Employments.
That affectation serves only to attract contempt. Whimsey has hatched many
Sects: but a Wise Man ought to espouse none of them. There are some strange
palates, that like nothing of what others love. Every thing that is singular
pleases them. It is true, that makes them to be taken notice of, but rather to
be laughed at than esteemed. Nay, (those who would be wise, ought to have a
special care not to affect to be so.) Upon far better ground ought they, who
are of a profession, that renders the professors ridiculous. We name not here
the Employments, seeing the contempt that every one has of them, makes them
sufficiently known.

MAXIM XXXI.
To know happy People, to make use of them, and the unhappy to avoid them.
Misfortune commonly is an effect of folly: and there is not a more dangerous
contagion than that of the unfortunate. We must not open the door to the least
evil, for others, and those greater too, which lie in ambush come always after.
The true skill at play, is to know how to discard. The lowest Card that turns
up, is better than the highest of the former dealing. In doubts, there is no
better expedient than to consult the wise: soon or late that will answer our
expectation.

MAXIM XXXII.
To have the reputation of contenting every body.
That gives Credit to those who Govern. By that means Sovereigns gain the good
will of the public. The only advantage they have, is, that they can do more
good than other men. Those are the truest Friends who are made by reiterated
Amities. But there are some of a humor of contenting no body, not so much
because that would be chargeable to them, as that their Nature is averse from
showing kindness. In all things contrary to Divine Bounty, which communicates
it self incessantly.

MAXIM XXXIII.
To know how to be a denied Man.
If it be a great art to know how to refuse favors, it is a far greater to be
able to deny ones self in business and visits. There are some troublesome
employments that corrode the most precious time. It is better to do nothing at
all, than to be busy to no purpose. It is not enough to be a prudent man, to
make no intrigues, but he must also avoid to meddle in them. We must not be so
much at the devotion of others, as not to be more at our own. We are not to
abuse Friends, nor to require more of them than they are willing to grant.
Every thing that is excessive is vicious, especially in conversation: and
without that moderation there is no preserving of the good will and esteem of
others, on which Civil Decency depends. One should use all his liberty in
choosing what is most excellent, but so, as he never offend against judgment and
discretion.

MAXIM XXXIV.
To know ones own strength.
That knowledge serves to cultivate the excellent and improve common
endowments. Many would have become great men, had they known their true Talent.
Strive then to know thine own, and join to it application. In some judgment has
the advantage, and in others courage: most part lay a constraint upon their
Genius: whence it is that they never excel in any thing. One is late in
forsaking what passion made him early espouse.

MAXIM XXXV.
To weigh things according to their just value.
It is the only ruin of Fools, that they never consider. Seeing they do not
comprehend things, they neither see the damage, nor profit, and by consequent
trouble themselves not about them. Some set a great value upon that which is
but of little worth, because they take all things the backward way. Many for
want of sense, feel not their distemper. There are some things on which one
cannot think too much. The wise man reflects on all, but not on all alike. For
he dives where there is any ground, and sometimes he thinks there is more in
the thing than he thinks of: So that his reflection goes as far as his
apprehension went.

MAXIM XXXVI.
Not to engage in any enterprise before one has examined his own fortune and
ability.
This experience is far more necessary than the knowledge of our constitution.
If it be the mark of a Fool to begin at forty years of age, to consult
Hipocrates about his health: He is a far greater Fool, who begins at that age,
to go to the School of Seneca, to learn how to live. It is no small point to
know how to govern ones fortune, whether it be in waiting till she be in the
good humor: (for she loves to be waited on) or in taking her such as she
offers. For she has an ebbing and flowing, and it is impossible to fix her,
being so irregular and variable as she is. Let him who has often found her
favorable, not desist from importuning her, because it is usual with her to
declare for the bold, and being courtly, to love the young. Let him who is
unhappy withdraw, that he may not meet with the affront of a double repulse, in
presence of a happy rival.

MAXIM XXXVII.
To guess at the meaning of the little hints that are given us by the bye, and
to know how to make the best of them.
This is the delicatest part in humane conversation; it is the finest probe of
the recesses of the heart of man. There are some malicious and angry jirks dipped
in the gall of passion: and these are imperceptible Thunderbolts, that strike
down those whom they smite. Many times a word has thrown down headlong from
the pinnacle of favor, those whom the murmurings of a whole people combined
against them could not so much as shake. There are other words or hints which
produce an effect quite contrary, that is to say, which support and increase the
reputation of those to whom they are addressed. But seeing they are cunningly
glanced, so also are they to be cautiously received. For the security consists
in smelling out the intention, and the blow foreseen is always warded.

MAXIM XXXVIII.
To be moderate in good fortune
Is the part of a good Gamester, when Reputation lies at stake. A brave Retreat
is as great as a brave Enterprise. When one has acted great exploits, he ought
to secure the glory of them, by drawing off in time. A continued Prosperity is
always suspected. That which has its interruptions is the surer. A little
sharp with the sweet makes it relish better. The more Prosperities crowd one
upon another, the more slippery they are, and subject to a reverse. The quality
of the pleasure makes sometimes amends for the shortness of the enjoyment.
Fortune is weary to carry one and the same man always upon her shoulders.

MAXIM XXXIX.
To know the nature and season of things, and to be able to make use of them.
The works of Nature commonly attain to the point of their perfection. They
increase always by degrees, until they arrive at it; and so soon as they are
come to that, decline again as fast. On the contrary, the works of art are
never so perfect, but that they still may be more. It is the sign of a quaint
discerning to observe what is excellent in every thing: but few are capable of
that, and those who may, do not always do it. There is a point of maturity
even in the fruits of the mind: and it is good to know that point, that we may
make our best of it.

MAXIM XL.
To gain the love of all.
It is much to be admired, but it is far more to be beloved. The fortunate
Planet contributes somewhat to that, but Industry all the rest. This perfects
what the other did but begin. An eminent merit is not enough, though, in
reality, it be easy to gain the affection, when one has once gained the
esteem. He that would be beloved, must love, be beneficent, give good words,
and still show better effects. Courtesy is the politic magic of great
Persons. One must first set his hand to great affairs, and then open it
liberally to good Pens: alternately employ the Sword and the Paper. For the
favor of Writers who perpetuate great Exploits is to be courted.

MAXIM XLI.
Never to Exaggerate.
Never to speak in Superlatives, is a sign of a Wise Man. For that way of
speaking always wounds either Truth or Prudence. Exaggerations are so many
prostitutions of Reputation, in that they discover the weakness of
understanding, and the bad discerning of him that speaks. Excessive Praises
excite Curiosity, and incite to Envy. So that if merit answer not the value
that is set upon it, as it commonly happens; general opinion revolts against
the imposture, and makes the flatterer and flattered both ridiculous. And
therefore a prudent man proceeds with a close rein, and chooses rather to offend
by giving too little, than too much. Excellence is rare, and by consequent the
value of it is to be well weighed. Exaggeration is a kind of lying: by
Exaggeration one gets himself the reputation of a man of bad discerning, and
which is worse, of little judgment.

MAXIM XLII.
Of the Ascendant.
This is a certain unaccountable force of Superiority that springs from the
Nature, and not from the Artifice, nor affectation of him that has it. Every
one submits thereto without knowing how, unless it be that one yields to the
insinuating power of the natural authority of another. These Paramount Genies
are Kings by merit, and Lions by a privilege that is born with them. They
command the Heart and Tongues of others by a secret Charm, that makes them be
respected. When such men have the other requisite qualities, they are cut out
for the chief movers of the Government Politic, in respect they can do more
with a hint, than others with all their efforts and reasons.

This Empire, says the Author, in the Chapter Del senorio en el dezir, etc.
is skotched out by nature, and finished by art. All who have that advantage,
find things ready done to their hands. Nay, Superiority it self facilitates all
things to them, insomuch that nothing puzles them, but in every thing they come
off with Honor. Their sayings and actions seem as great again as they are. An
ordinary thing has even appeared excellent, when seconded by that Empire. They
who want that Superiority, enter diffidently upon affairs: which takes from
them much of their gracefulness, especially if it be observed. From diffidence
immediately springs fear, which shamefully banishes assurance; and by
consequent action and reason loose all their luster. That fear so absolutely
Tyrannizes over the mind, that it deprives it of all liberty. Insomuch that
reason is at a stand, words are frozen, and activity remains under an interdict.

The Ascendant of him that speaks, gains him at first the respect of him who
hears. It makes the greatest Critic give attention, and Sovereignly sways the
consent of a whole Company. It furnishes expressions, nay, and sentences to the
person that speaks: whereas fear choaks the words. Timidity is sufficient to
chill reasoning: and though it could overflow with a Torrent of Eloquence, yet
the great cold of fear will put a stop to its course.

He that with Native Authority enters into Conversation, has respect at his
Devotion before hand: But he who comes to it with fear, accuses himself of
weakness, and confesses he is overcome: for which diffidence of mind he is
despised, or at best not much esteemed of others. The truth is, a wise man
ought to be reserved, and particularly when he is not acquainted with his
company. He first tries the foard, but especially if he foresee that it is deep.

Though it be both Civility and Duty to qualify this imperious boldness, in
speaking to Princes and great men; yet one must have a care of falling into the
extremity of discomposing bashfulness. There it is that a man ought to keep a
mean betwixt boldness and confusion, that he may neither be disagreeable nor
ridiculous. Let neither thy fear be so great, as to make thee lose assurance;
nor thy boldness so saucy, as to forget respect.

That Superiority glisters in all sorts of people, but much more in great men.
In an Orator it is more than one circumstance: It Is essential to a Lawyer; In
an Ambassador it is a glorious Quality; and a victorious Attribute in a
Commander: but in a Prince it is the Ornament of perfection. It raises the
price of all humane actions; and reaches even the countenance, which is the
throne of comeliness; and the gate also in such a manner, that the steps of a
man are the signatures of the character of his heart; and judicious persons
delineate theirs by a noble way of acting and speaking. For sublime actions are
of double value, when they are accompanied with majesty.

Some are born with an universal power in all that they say and do. One would
say that nature had made them the elder brothers of mankind. They are designed
to be Superiors in all things, if not in Dignity, at least in Merit. A spirit
of Dominion exerts it self in them, even in their most common actions. All obey
them, because in every thing they excel. They rob the hearts, and so at first
become the masters of others; for their capacity is large enough for all
things. And though there may be others sometimes that have more learning,
nobility, nay, and vrtue; yet still they get the better on it by an Ascendant,
that gives them the Superiority; so that if they be not in the right, yet at
least they make good their title by possession.

MAXIM XLIII.
To speak with the Vulgar, but to think with the Wise.
To go against the stream, is a thing wherein it is as impossible to succeed,
as it is easy to be exposed to danger. Socrates was the only man that could
undertake it. Contradiction passes for an affront, because it is a condemning
of the Judgment of another. Malcontents multiply, sometimes because of the
thing that is censured; and sometimes because of the Party that it had. Truth
is known but of a very few, and false Opinions go current with the rest of the
world. One must not judge of a wise man by what he says, seeing sometimes he
speaks at second hand, that is to say, according to the common voice, though his
judgment give the lie to the vulgar error. A wise man shuns as much to be
contradicted, as to contradict. The more his judgment enclines him to censure,
the more he has a care not to publish it. Opinion is free; it neither can nor
ought to be forced. The wise man retires within the Sanctuary of his silence,
and if sometimes he be communicative, it is but to a few, and those the Wise.

MAXIM XLIV.
To sympathize with great men.
It is the quality of a Hero to love a Hero; it is a secret instinct that
nature bestows upon those whom she intends to conduct to Heroism. There is a
kindred of hearts and inclinations, and the effects of it are by the vulgar
attributed to enchantment. That sympathy rests not at esteem, it proceeds to
good will, and at length arrives at affection: it persuades without speaking,
and obtains without recommendation. There is an active and a passive, and the
more sublime, the more happy they are. The skill lies in knowing,
distinguishing, and understanding how to make the best use of them. Without
that inclination the rest is good for nothing.

MAXIM XLV.
To use Reflection without abusing it.
Reflection ought neither to be affected nor known. Artifice is to be hid, in as
much as it is suspicious, and all caution more, because it is odious. If
Cheating be in vogue; double your vigilance, but without making it known, lest
that make people distrustful. Suspicion provokes to revenge, and sets men upon
thoughts of doing the hurt, that they never thought on before. Reflection upon
the state of affairs, is a great help in acting. There is not a better proof of
a man of sense, than to be reflexive. The greatest perfection of actions
depends on the full knowledge with which they have been executed.

MAXIM XLVI.
To correct ones Antipathy.
It is our custom to hate right or wrong, that is to say, even before we know
what he is, whom we hat: and sometimes that vulgar aversion, has the boldness
to attack great persons. Prudence ought to keep it under. For nothing
discredits us more, than to hate those who deserve to be beloved. As it is
noble to sympathize with Heroes, so is it disgraceful to have antipathy
against them.

MAXIM XLVII.
To shun Engagements
Is one of the chief Maxims of Prudence. In large places there is always great
distance from one end to the other. It is the same in great affairs. We must
jog on a good way before we come to see the end of them. And therefore the wise
engage not willingly therein. They come to a rupture as late as possibly they
can, seeing it is easier to wave the occasion, than to get off, if engaged with
honor. There are temptations of judgment, which it is safer to avoid, than to
overcome. One Engagement draws a greater after it, and commonly there is a
precipice hard by. Some men naturally, and sometimes through a national fault,
meddle in every thing, and engage inconsiderately. But he that takes reason for
his Guide, proceeds always with circumspection. He finds greater advantage in
not engaging, than in overcoming: and though some rash blockhead may be ready
to begin, yet he has a care not to make a second.

MAXIM XLVIII.
The man of a good Stock.
The more depth one has, the more man he is. The inside ought to be worth as
much again as what appears outwardly. Some men have no more but a front, just
like Houses, which for want of a good foundation, have not been finished. The
entry speaks the Palace, and the Cottage the Lodging. These men have nothing
that one can fix upon, or rather every thing is fixed with them. For after the
first salutation the conversation is at an end. They make their complement of
entry, as the Sicilian Horses their Caracols, and then all of a sudden are
dumb. For words are soon drained when the Understanding is shallow. It is easy
for them to deceive others, who like themselves have nothing but a show; but
they are fops to men of discerning, who presently discover that they are empty
within.

MAXIM XLIX.
The judicious and penetrating man
Masters objects, and is never mastered by them. He presently sounds the bottom
of the profoundest depth. He knows very well how to make the Anatomy of men's
capacities. Let him but look upon a man, and he will dive into the depth of him,
and know him thoroughly. He deciphers all the secrets of the closest heart. He
is quick in conceiving, severe in censuring, and judicious in drawing his
consequences. He discovers all, observes all, and comprehends all.

That and the preceding Maxim have their Commentary in the Authors Discreet,
chapter Hombre Juizioso y notante, where thus he speaks.

Momus reasoned but very dully, when he would have had a little Window to be
made in the heart of Man. It would be of very little use to some men, who look
through perspective glasses. A good judgment is the principal key of another
man's heart. It is to no purpose for ignorance to retreat into the Sanctuary of
silence, and Hypocrisy into a whited Sepulcher, a judicious man discovers all,
guesses at all, and penetrates into all. He at first distinguishes appearance
from reality. He looks into the inside, and rests not on the vulgar surface. He
deciphers the intentions and ends; for the key of Criticizing is in his
possession. Seldom has deceit, and far less ignorance bragged of being too
hard for him. That pre-eminence has rendered Tacitus so famous in the
particular, and Seneca so esteemed in the common. There is no quality more
opposite to vulgar ignorance than this: it is sufficient alone to gain a man
the reputation of discreet. The vulgar has always been malicious, but never
judicious: And though it says any thing, yet it understands not every thing. It
seldom distinguishes truth from probability. Seeing it never bites but the
bark, it swallows down all, without nauseating a lie. And about two pages
after. A yea from those judges of merit and capacity, is worth more than all
the acclamations of a people. And it was not without ground, that Plato called
Aristotle his whole School; and Antigonus the Philosopher Zeno, the whole sum
of his Renown. But it is to be observed that there is great difference betwixt
censure and backbiting For the one is grounded upon indifference, and the other
upon malice. Our Aphorism enjoins not a discreet man to be satirical, but to be
intelligent: it prescribes not the condemning of every thing, which would be an
insupportable extravagance of mind; but far less the approving all things,
which is the silliest piece of Pedantry.

MAXIM L.
Never to lose the respect which is due to ones self.
One ought to be such, as to have no cause of blushing in private. His own
Conscience ought to be a sufficient rule of his Actions. A good man is more
obliged to his own severity, than to all Precepts. He refrains to do what is
indifferent, for fear of wounding his own modesty, rather than offending
against the Authority of his Superiors. When one stands in awe of himself, he
stands in no need of Seneca's imaginary Tutor.

MAXIM LI.
The man of a good choice.
A good choice supposes a good discerning and good sense. Wit and Study are not
sufficient to make a happy life. There is no perfection, where there is nothing
to be chosen. To be able to choose, and to choose well, are the two advantages of
a good discerning. Many who have a pregnant and fertile wit, a strong judgment,
and much knowledge acquired by study, are at a loss when they are to make a
choice: it is fatal to them to hit upon the worst, and one would say, that they
loved to deceive themselves. It is then one of the greatest gifts of Heaven, to
be a man of a good choice.

MAXIM LII.
Never to be disordered.
It is a great point always to be master of ones self. A man thereby becomes
excellent, and has the heart of a King, seeing it is very difficult to shake a
great Soul. Passions are the Elementary humors of the mind: so soon as these
humors exceed, the mind becomes sick; and if the distemper rise to the mouth,
Reputation is much in danger. One ought therefore so to get the mastery over
himself, that he may never be accused of transport, neither in the height of
prosperity, nor in the worst of adversity; but on the contrary make himself be
admired as invincible.

MAXIM LIII.
Diligent and intelligent.
Diligence executes speedily what intelligence projects slowly. Precipitancy is
the passion of fools, who not being able to discover the danger, act at
hap-hazard. On the contrary, the wise trespass in slowness, the common effect
of reflection. Sometimes delay makes a well concerted enterprise to miscarry.
Speedy execution is the mother of good Fortune. He has done much, who has
left nothing to be done till to morrow. It Is a saying worthy of Augustus:
Festina lent, make haste slowly.

MAXIM LIVE.
To be a man of metal.
When the Lion is dead, the Beasts are not afraid. Brave men are not to be
jeasted with. If one resist not the first time, he will far less resist the
second, and it grows still worse and worse. For the same difficulty that in the
beginning might have been surmounted, is greater in the end. The vigor of mind
surpasses that of the body, it must always be in a readiness, as well as the
Sword, to be made use of when occasion serves. By that means we gain respect.
Many men have had eminent qualities, who for want of a good heart, have been
looked upon as dead, seeing they have been buried alive in the obscurity of
contempt. It is not without reason that Nature has given Bees both honey and a
sting, and the body of man also both nerves and bones. The mind then, must also
have some mixture of sweetness and resolution.

MAXIM LV.
The man that can wait with patience.
Never to be too forward nor passionate, is the sign of a free and unconfined
heart. He that is master of himself, will soon be of others. We must traverse
the large carriere of time, before we come to the center of occasion. A
rational temporizing ripens secrets and resolutions. The crutch of time does
more business than the Club of Hercules. God himself when he punishes us, makes
not use of the rod, but of the season. It was a good saying of Philip the
second of Spain: Time and I are good enough for other two. Nay, Fortune rewards
with interest those who have the patience to wait for her.

The Author in the third Chapter of his Discreet, having given an allegorical
description of the triumphant Chariot of Expectation, drawn by Remora's, and of
her Throne made of the shell of a Tortoise; and having told, how that Chariot
was on a day attacked by a Squadron of Monsters, which were blind passion,
undiscreet engagement, imprudent haste, fool-hardiness, inconsideration,
precipitation and confusion: Expectation, says he, knowing the greatness of the
danger, commanded Retention to make hault; and Dissimulation to amuse the
Enemies, whilst she should consult what was best to be done.

The wise Bias, chief Servant to that great Mistress of her self, advised her
to imitate Jupiter, whose Thunderbolts would have already been all spent, if he
had not had patience. Louis XI. King of France, was of the Opinion that she
should dissemble as he had done, who never taught his Son any other Grammar,
nor other Politics. Don John II. King of Aragon, represented to her, that till
then the Spanish delaying had wrought more than the French haste. The great
Augustus recommended above all things, and instead of all, his Festina Lent.
The Catholic King Don Ferdinand, as a Prince of Politics, wherein expectation
is well versed, spoke more largely. One must, said he, be master of ones self,
and then he will quickly be of others. Temporizing seasons resolutions, and
ripens secrets: whereas precipitation always begets untimely births that never
attain to the life of immortality. One must think leisurely, and execute
speedily. All diligence that is not directed by staidness runs great risk.
Things escape from it, as easily as they fall in its way: and sometimes the
resounding of the fall is the first signal of their being laid hold on.
Expectation is the fruit of great hearts; and abounds in good successes. Men of
little courage can neither keep time nor secrets. And then he concludes with
that Catalan Oracle: God makes not use of the rod but of the season.

MAXIM LVI.
To find out good expedients.
Is the effect of a happy quickness which is no more puzzled at any thing, than
as if nothing happened fortuitously: Some after long plodding, are still
mistaken in every thing; and others hit upon expedients for all things, without
thinking on them before. There are characters of Antiperistasis, that never
succeed better than in a plunge. These are Prodigies that do every thing well
upon the spot, and all things ill which they have premeditated. What they hit
not upon at first, they never hit upon. Such people have great Reputation,
because by the quickness of their thoughts, and the success of their
enterprises, men judge their capacity to be Prodigious.

Promptitude, says the Author, in his Discreet, Chap. Tener buevos repentes,
is the Mother of good Fortune. Unpremeditated hits proceed always from a
highflown mind. And some lines after. If esteem be due to all that is
pertinently done or said, a pat expedient found out at the nick, deserves
applause. Readiness and success give a double value to things. Some think much,
and nevertheless still fail; and others succeed in all things, without thinking
on them before. The quickness of wit supplies the defect of a deep judgment.
What offers at first anticipates consultation. There is nothing casual for such
men, inasmuch as the presence of mind stands them in stead of forecast.
Extemporaries are the gentile feats of a good discerning, and the loadstone of
admiration. Ordinary actions unpremeditated, make a greater show than high
designs that have been concerted. And a page after. One single extemporary hit
was enough to procure Solomon the renown of being the wisest of men. By one
word he rendered himself more redoubtable, than by all his power. Alexander and
Caesar deserved to be the elder Sons of Fame, the one by bethinking himself to
cut the Gordian Knot; and the other by saying when he fell, It is a good sign
that Africa is under me. Two Extemporaries were as good to both, as the
Conquest of two parts of the world. That essay gave a specimen, if they were
capable of ruling the Universe.

If a sudden repartee has always been plausible, a prompt resolution deserves
well to be applauded. A happy promptitude in the effects, shows an eminent
activity in the cause. Promptitude in conceiving, is a sign of subtilty, and a
readiness in finding out good expedients, is a proof of Wisdom so much the
more to be esteemed, that there is a great distance betwixt vivacity and
prudence, and betwixt wit and judgment.

It is a perfection no less necessary than sublime in Generals of Armies, and
brave men, inasmuch as their actions and executions are for most part all
sudden and transitory, by reason of the many fortuitous cases that have neither
been foreseen, nor consulted; and so must be ordered according as occasion
offers: wherein consists the triumph of their presence of mind, and by
consequent the whole assurance of their Victories.

But it becomes Kings better to think, because all their actions are eternal.
They are to consider for many, and consequently have need of much Auxiliary
Prudence, that they may secure the public repose. They have time, and their
Beds, where they let their resolutions ripen. They spend whole nights in
thinking, that they may spend the days in safety. In a word, they labor more
with the head than with the hands.

And in the third Chapter of a Hero. He thus speaks.

The sayings of Alexander are the Flamboes of his deeds. Caesar was equally
prompt in thinking and in acting. The promptitude of the mind is as happy as
that of the will is dangerous. It furnishes wings for soaring to the height of
grandeur. With these wings many have raised themselves from the center of
obscurity to the orb of the Sun.

If subtilty reign not, it deserves, at least to accompany those who reign. The
ordinary sayings of a King are Crowned points of Wit. The treasures of Princes
often fail; but their witty sayings are everlastingly preserved in the
repository of Fame. Brave men have gone farther sometimes with one word, than
with the force of their Arms, Victory being the ordinary reward of a shot of
wit. The King of Sages, and the wisest of Kings, acquired that reputation by
the ready expedient, which he found out in the greatest of all differences,
which was to plead for an Infant. And this shows that wit is useful to give
credit to Justice.

MAXIM LVII.
The surest men are men of Reflection.
What is well, comes always in good time. What is incontinently done, is as
soon undone. That which is to last to eternity, ought to be an eternity a
making. Perfection is the only thing that is minded, and nothing lasts but
what is perfect. All that proceeds from a profound Understanding, endures for
ever. What is worth much costs much. The most precious Metal is the latest in
coming to perfection, and the heaviest.

Soon enough, if well enough, said a Wise Man. We examine not how long one has
been a doing of a work, but if it be well done. That only makes it valuable.
Fast and slow, are accidents which are unknown or forgotten: whereas Well is
permanent. What is done in a trice, will be undone all of a sudden. It soon
ends, because it was soon finished. The more the Children of Saturn come before
the time, the faster he devours them. That which is to last for eternity, ought
to be an eternity in coming. Gratian in his Discreet, Chap. Tener buevos
repentes.

Apelles said to a Painter, who bragged that he spent but little time in making
his Pictures: That is easily believed, because it is seen. The famous Michael
Angelo, who was very long about his Works, said, that in arts haste was good
for nothing, and that as Nature takes much time in forming Animals, that are to
last long: so Art that strives to imitate Nature, ought to work leisurely, it
being impossible for man to do any thing that is excellent in haste.

MAXIM LVIII.
To shape ones self according to people.
One must not strive to show his parts alike with all people, nor employ
greater force than the occasion requires. There must be no profusion neither of
knowledge nor power. The skillful Fowler throws no more meat to the Birds than
what is necessary to catch them. Have a special care not to make ostentation of
every thing, for you will soon come to want admirers. Some new thing is to be
kept in store, that we may appear with to morrow: every day a fresh proof, is
the way still to keep in credit, and to be the more admired, that so one never
shows the bounds of his capacity.

MAXIM LIX.
The man that makes himself to be desired and regretted.
If a man enter the house of Fortune by the gate of pleasure, he comes out
commonly by the door of vexation. It is greater art to get out happily, than to
enter it with popular applause. It is the ordinary lot of fortunate people to
have most favorable beginnings, and then a tragical end. Felicity consists not
in having the applause of the people at ones entry: for that is an advantage
which all that enter have. The difficult matter is to have the same applause at
ones exit. You see but very few who are regrated. It seldom happens that they
who go out, are accompanied with good fortune. For it is her pleasure to be as
surly to those that go, as she is civil and caressing to those who come.

The same applause, says he in his Discreet, Chap. Hombre de buen dexo, that
one has had in the beginning, makes the murmuring the greater at the end. The
fronts of Offices are all magnificent, but never the back parts, entries into
Dignities are Crowned like Victories, but the goings off are attended with
curses.

What strange applauses to an Authority that begins, whether because of the
pleasure that people take in changes, or of the hopes that every one has to
obtain particular favors! but when it expires, alas, what silence! nay, and
silence would stand in stead of a favorable acclamation too.

Prudence applies it self wholly to end things well. It is far more attentive
how to come out, than in listening to the applauses of an entry. A vigilant
Palinurus governed not his Vessel by the head, but by the stern. There he keeps
himself, that he may conduct her through the voyage of this life: all the
disgrace, (and as he says in the beginning of that Chapter) all the race of
misfortune remains for the end, as all the bitterness is at the ground of the
potion. The precept of that Roman for beginning and ending was excellent, who
said that he had obtained all Dignities before he desired them, and had left
them all, before they were desired by others. Misfortune is sometimes the
punishment of immoderation. It is the comfort of the Wise, that they have
retired before Fortune withdrew. Heaven it self has employed that remedy in
favors of some Heroes. Moses disappeared, and Elias was taken up, that so they
might end in triumph.

MAXIM LX.
Good sense.
Some are born Prudent, by a natural inclination they enter into the way of
wisdom, and they are got almost half way at first. Their reason ripens with
age and experience, and at length they attain to the highest degree of
judgment. They startle at capriciousness, as a temptation of their prudence,
but especially in matters of State; which by reason of their extreme
importance, require the strictest circumspection. Such men deserve to sit at
the helm of Government, or at least to be Counselors to those who hold it.

MAXIM LXI.
To excel in the excellent
Is a thing very singular in the plurality of perfections. There can be no
Hero without some extreme sublimity. Mediocrity is not an object big enough
for applause. Eminence in a high employment distinguishes from the vulgar, and
raises one to the category of rare men. To be eminent in a low profession, is
to be great in little, and something in nothing. What is most delectable is
least sublime. Eminence in high matters is as a character of Sovereignty, which
excites admiration, and conciliates good will.

MAXIM LXII.
To make use of good Instruments.
Some make the quaintness of their wit to consist in employing bad instruments.
A dangerous point of honor, and worthy of an unhappy issue. The excellence of
the Minister has never lessened the glory of the Master: on the contrary, all
the honor of the success rebounds upon the principal cause; and in like manner
all the blame. Fame sounds always the praises of the first Authors. It never
says: That Man has had good or bad Servants; but, That he has been a good or
bad Workman. One must therefore endeavor to choose his Ministers well, since on
them depends the immortality of Reputation.

MAXIM LXIII.
The excellence of Primacy.
If Primacy be backed by Eminence, it is on a double account excellent. It is a
great advantage to have the hand at play, for that gives the better on it, if
the Cards be equal. Several had been the Phoenix of their Profession, if others
had not gone before them. The first have the birthright in the inheritance of
reputation, and there remains but a scanty portion of the Juniors, nay and that
too contested. It Is to no purpose for those to fret, they cannot baffle the
opinion which the world has, that they do no more but imitate. Great spirits
have always affected a new way for attaining to excellence: yet so, that
Prudence has always been employed for their guide. The Wise by the novelty of
their enterprises get themselves to be listed in the Catalogue of Heroes. Some
had rather be the Captains of the second form, than the seconds of the first.

MAXIM LXIV.
To vex as little as may be.
Is a most useful Science. It Is as the Midwife to all the happiness of life.
It is good for nothing either to give or receive bad tidings. We are only to
give entry to those that assuage trouble. There are some who employ their Ear
only in hearing flatteries; others please themselves to listen to false
reports; and some cannot live so much as one day without some vexation, no more
than Mithridates could without poison. Nay, it is a far greater absurdity for
one to be willing to disturb himself as long as he lives, that he may once give
satisfaction to another, how closely soever he may be linked to him. We must
never offend against our selves, to comply with him, who advises, and keeps off
at a distance. It is therefore a rational and useful lesson, that as often as
it is put to thy option to please another or displease thy self, thou wilt do
better to let another be discontented, than to become so thy self, and that
without remedy.

MAXIM LXV.
The quaint and critical Judgment.
The judgment is cultivated as well as the wit. The excellence of understanding
refines the desire, and then the pleasure of enjoyment. The extent of the
capacity is measured by the niceness of the judgment. A great capacity stands
in need of a great object to give it content, as a large stomach requires
proportionable food, so high minds demand elevated matters. The noblest objects
are afraid of a delicate judgment, perfections that are generally esteemed,
dare not hope to please it. Seeing there is but very little without defect, one
ought to be very sparing of esteem. Judgments are formed in conversation, and
we make another man's judgment our own by frequenting his company. It is then a
great happiness to have commerce with persons of an excellent judgment. Yet we
must not make profession of esteeming nothing at all. For that is an extreme
folly, and an affectation more odious than a depraved palate. Some would have
God to make another world, and other beauties to satisfy their extravagant and
whimsical fancies.

MAXIM LXVI.
To take good measures before one undertakes.
Some eye the project more than the event: and nevertheless direction is not a
sufficient surety to save one from the dishonor that attends an unfortunate
issue. The Conqueror has no account to give. There are but a few who are
capable to examine the reasons and circumstances, but every one judges by the
event. And therefore a successful man never loses his reputation. A happy end
crowns all, though wrong means may have been used for attaining to it. For it
is art to go contrary to art, when otherwise one cannot compass what he intends.

MAXIM LXVII.
To prefer plausible Employments.
Most things depend upon the satisfaction of others. Esteem is to perfections,
what the Zephyres are to flowers; that is to say, nourishment and life. There
are some employments generally applauded, and others, which though they be
high, yet are not courted. The former gain the good will of all, because they
are managed in sight of all people. The other are more majestuous, and as such,
attract more veneration: but because they are undiscernable, they are the less
applauded to. Amongst Princes, the victorious are the more celebrated: and
hence it is that the Kings of Aragon have been so famous, by their titles of
Warriors, Conquerours, Magnanimous. Let a man of merit, if he would eternise
his memory by general applause, choose then such employments, wherein every one
has some knowledge, and all have a share.

Some, says the Author in the eighth Chapter of his Hero, prefer difficult
employments before others that are more plausible, the admiration of some
choice men being more charming to them, than the applause of a great many in
the crowd. They call plausible enterprises the miracles of the ignorant. The
truth is, few men know the difficulty and excellence of a great undertaking;
but seeing these are sublime spirits, for all they are so few, they fail not to
put them in vogue. What is plausible is easily known, it familiarizes it self
to the senses; but then the applause it receives, is so much the more vulgar,
that it is universal. The daintiness of the small number carries it over the
multitude of the vulgar. Nevertheless, it is the character of a fine wit, to
bribe common attention by the charm of plausibility: since eminence dazzling the
Eyes of all, settles Reputation by common consent. We must esteem what most
esteem. The excellence of plausible actions is conspicuous: whereas those which
are above the ordinary reach, are never so evident, but that they are still
very metaphysical, being no ways illustrious but by the Idea's that men
conceive of them. I call that plausible which is acted in view, and to the
satisfaction of all people, and has always reputation for a basis. Whereby I
exclude some employments that are as void of credit, as they are full of
ostentation. A Comedian is rich in applauses, but poor in esteem. In the
functions of the mind the plausible has ever had the honor. A polite and
smooth running discourse tickles the ears, and charms the understanding: on the
contrary, a dry, bombast, metaphysical expression offends or cloys the hearers.
And in his Discreet, Chap. Hombre de buena election: There are, says he,
employments, the chief exercise whereof consists in choosing, and which depend
more upon others, than upon the practiser: as are all such whose end is to
teach and please. Let the Orator then prefer plausible arguments. The
Historian mingle the pleasant with the useful: and the Philosopher the
specious with the sententious. Let them all study to fit the universal relish
of others; which is the true method of choosing. For it is the same as in a
Feast, where the Dishes are not dressed for the palate of the Cooks, but of the
Guests. What signifies it, that the matters exceedingly please the Orator, if
they be not relished by the hearers, for whom they are prepared?

-- Nam coenae fercula nostrae,
Malim convivis, quam placuisse cocis.
Says Martial.

MAXIM LXVIII.
To inform, is far better than to put in mind.
Sometimes we are to rememorate, sometimes advise. There are many who fail to
do things which would be excellent, because they thought not of them. Then it
is that a good advice is in season, to make them conceive what is important to
be done. It is one of the greatest Talents of a man to have a present mind to
think on what he has to do, for want whereof many affairs miscarry. He then
that comprehends, is to carry the light; and he that needs to be lighted, ought
to make application to the other. The first ought to be sparing, and the other
diligent. It Is enough for the former to clear the way for the latter. This is a
very important maxim, and profitable for him that instructs: and in case his
first lesson be not sufficient, he ought with pleasure to proceed. Having once
conquered the Nay, he must dexterously catch hold of a Yea. For it often
happens, that nothing is obtained, because nothing attempted.

MAXIM LXIX.
Not to be of the humor of the vulgar.
He is a great man that gives no admission to popular impressions. It is a
lesson of Prudence to reflect upon ones self, to know ones own inclination, to
prevent it, and even to go to the other extremity, that one may find the poise
of reason betwixt nature and art. The knowledge of ones self is the beginning
of amendment. There are some Monsters of impertinence, who are now of one
humor, and by and by of another; and change their opinions as their humors.
They engage in quite contrary affairs, being always hurried away by the
impetuosity of that civil torrent, which not only corrupts the will, but also
the knowledge and judgment.

A great Capacity (says the Author in the Chapter, No rendirse al humor of
his Discreet) is never carried with the flux and reflux neither of humors, nor
of passions. It is always above that clownish immoderation. Many shamefully
suffer themselves to be tyrannized over by the predominant humor. They
maintain to day what they contradicted yesterday. Sometime they stand for
reason, and sometimes they trample it under foot. There is no rest for their
judgments, which is the height of extravagance. You cannot take them in a good
sense, because they have none. Yesterday and to day they differ as much as
black and white: and then having been the first to contradict themselves, they
contradict all others. When once we understand their depraved mind, it is best
to let them alone in their own confusion. For the more they do, the more they
undo.

It is the sign of a rich stock of sense, to know how to prevent and correct
ones humor, since it is a disease of mind, wherein a wise man ought to govern
himself as in a distemper of body.

There are such far gone impertinents, that they are always in some humor;
always galled with some passion; insupportable to those who have to do with
them, perpetual Enemies of conversation and civility, who have no relish of the
best things; more incurable than stark fools. For with a little compliance
these are wheedled, and those grow worse by it. There is nothing to be got of
them by reason, for having none themselves, they will receive none from others.

But if a man sometimes fall into a passion, and that but rarely, and for a
great cause, that will be no ground to accuse him of a vulgar humor. For never
to be angry, is to be always a Beast. But a constant bad humor, and toward
all people, is insupportable Clownishness. Anger, which makes the slave, may
still be a sauce for a free state. But he that is not capable of knowing
himself, will be still less of correcting himself.

MAXIM LXX.
To know how to refuse.
All is not to be granted, nor to all. To know how to refuse, is as important
as to know how to bestow; and it is a very necessary qualification in those who
command. All consists in the manner. A Nay of some is better received than a
Yea of others, because a Nay seasoned with civility, gives greater content than
a Yea with bad grace. There are some who have always a Nay in their mouth. No,
is always their first answer, and though they chance afterward to grant all
that is desired, they have no thanks for it, because of the unsavory No that
went before. We must not refuse point blanck, but make our denial be taken down
by little sips, if I may say so. Nor must we refuse all things neither, lest we
put people into despair: but on the contrary, leave always a remnant of hope to
sweeten the bitterness of the denial. Let Courtesy fill up the vacuity of
favor, and good words supply the defect of good deeds. Yea and No are soon
said, but before we say them, we should think on them long first.

MAXIM LXXI.
Not to be unequal, and irregular in ones proceeding.
A prudent man never falls into that fault neither through humor nor
affectation. He is still the same in relation to that which is perfect; which
is the mark of a sound judgment. If sometimes he change, it is because the
countenance of occasions and affairs is changed. All inequality mis-becomes
Prudence. There are some who daily differ from themselves. Their understanding
is even journal, and much more their will and conduct. What was yesterday their
pleasant Yea, is to day their unpleasant No. They always falsify their
proceeding, and the opinion that men have of them, because they are never
themselves.

MAXIM LXXII.
The man of resolution.
Irresolution is worse than bad execution. Waters corrupt not so long as they
run, but when they are standing. There are some men so irresolute, that they
never do any thing but when they are pusht on to it by others: and that
sometimes proceeds not so much from the puzle of their judgment, which is often
quick and subtle, as from a natural laziness. It is a sign of a great mind to
raise to it self difficulties, but of a greater to know how to clear them.
There are also men who are puzzled at nothing, and these are born for great
employments, inasmuch as the quickness of their conception, and steadiness of
their judgment, facilitate to them the understanding and dispatch of affairs.
Whatever falls into their hands is as good as done. One of that character
having given the Law to one whole world, had time enough over and above to
think of another. Such men undertake with assurance, under the protection of
their good fortune.

MAXIM LXXIII.
To find out Evasions
Is the knack of men of wit. With a touch of gallantry they extricate
themselves out of the greatest labyrinth. A graceful smile will make them
avoid the most dangerous quarrel. The greatest of Captains founded all his
Reputation upon that. A word of a double meaning agreeably palliates a
negative. There is nothing better, than never to be too well understood.

MAXIM LXXIII.
Not to be inaccessible.
The true wild Beasts are where most people are. A difficult access is the vice
of those whose manners honor has changed. To begin by rejecting of others, is
not the way to get credit. How pleasant is it to see one of those untractable
monsters strut it in the garb of haughtiness! They, who are so unhappy as to
have business with them, go to their Audience, as if they were going to fight
with Tigers, that is to say, armed as much with fear as circumspection. To mount
up to that post they cringed to all people; but so soon as they are in it, it
seems they would take their revenge by huffing every body. Their employment
requires that they should be free to all men: but their pride and surly humor
makes them accessible to no man. So that the true way to be revenged on them,
is to let them alone by themselves, to the end, that wanting all conversation,
they may never become wise.

MAXIM LXXV.
To propose to ones self some Hero, not so much to be imitated, as to be
surpassed.
There are models of grandeur, and living books of reputation. Let every one
propose to themselves those who have excelled in their Profession, not so much
to follow as to outstrip them. Alexander wept, not that he saw Achilles in the
Tomb, but to see himself so little known in the world, in comparison of
Achilles. Nothing inspires more Ambition than the fame of another's Reputation.
That which stisles envy, gives breath to courage.

MAXIM LXXVI.
Not to be always in the jocose humor.
Prudence appears in seriousness; and the serious are more esteemed than the
jocose. He that drolls always, is never a thorough-pac'd man. We use these men,
as we do liars, not believing what one nor the other says, jeasting being no
less suspected than lying. It is never known when they speak with judgment,
which is the same as if they had none at all. There is nothing more unpleasant
than a continual pleasantness. By endeavoring to purchase the Reputation of
being pleasant, one loses the advantage of being thought wise. Some minutes are
to be allowed to mirth, and the rest to seriousness.

MAXIM LXXVII.
To be company for all sorts of men.
He is a wise Proteus that is holy with the holy, learned with the learned,
serious with the serious, and jovial with the merry. That is the way to gain
all hearts, similitude being the bond of good will. To discern tempers, and by
a politic transformation to suit the humor and character of every one, is a
secret absolutely necessary for those who depend on others. But that requires a
great stock. A man who is universal in knowledge and experience, has less
trouble in doing it.

MAXIM LXXVIII.
The art of undertaking to purpose.
Folly enters always at random: for all fools are bold. The same ignorance
which hinders them at first from considering what is necessary, hides from them
afterward the knowledge of the faults which they commit. But Wisdom enters
with great circumspection. Her Forerunners are reflection and discretion, that
scour the road for her, that so she may advance without any danger. Discretion
condemns all kinds of temerity to a precipice, though good fortune sometime
justify them. One ought to go step by step where he suspects there is any
depth. It is the part of judgment to try, and of Prudence to pursue. There are
at present great shelves in the commerce of the world. We ought therefore to
have a care of our soundings.

MAXIM LXXIX.
The jovial humor
Is rather an accomplishment than a defect, when there is no excess in it. A
grain of mirth seasons all. The greatest men, as well as others play their
frolicks, for conciliating the good will of every body: but with this
difference that they always retain the preference for wisdom, and respect to
decency. Others come off when they are gone too far by a spell of good humor.
For some things are to be taken laughing, and the very same sometimes that
others take in good earnest. Such a humor is the loadstone of hearts.

MAXIM LXXX.
To be careful to be informed.
The life of man is almost wholly spent in taking information. What we see is
the least essential. We live upon the credit of others. The ear is the second
door to truth, and the first to lies. Commonly truth is seen, but it is
extraordinary to hear it. It seldom comes pure to our ears, especially when it
come from a far. For then it takes some tincture of the passions that it meets
by the way. It pleases or displeases, according to the colors that passion or
interest give it, which aim always at prepossessing. Have a care of him that
praises; but much more of him that blames. There it is that one has need of a
sharp sight, to discover the intention of him that makes his pass, and to know
before hand where he has a mind to hit. Make use of reflection in discerning the
slight or counterfeit from the good stuff.

MAXIM LXXXI.
To revive ones Reputation from time to time
Is the privilege of the Phoenix. Excellence is subject to grow old, and with
it in like manner fame. Custom lessens admiration. An ordinary novelty
commonly carries it from the highest excellence, that begins to grow old. One
had need then to revive in valor, wit, fortune, in all things, and to show
always new beauties, as the Sun does, which so often changes Horizons and
Theaters, that so privation may make him desirable when he sets; and novelty
admirable, when he rises.

MAXIM LXXXII.
Not to pry too much neither into good nor evil.
A wise man comprehended all his wisdom in this Precept, ne quid nimis,
nothing too much. Too strict a justice degenerates into injustice. The Orange
that is too much squeezed, yields a bitter juice. Nay in enjoyment, we ought
never to go to either of the two extremes. Wit it self is exhausted by too much
straining. By endeavoring to draw down too much milk, blood is often fetched.

MAXIM LXXXIII.
To commit some small faults on design.
A little negligence sometimes sets off good qualities. Envy has its
Ostracism, and that Ostracism is the more in fashion. That it is unjust. It
accuses that which is perfect of the fault of being without a fault: and the
perfecter the thing is, the more it condemns it. It is an Argus in discovering
faults in that which is most excellent, and perhaps out of spite of coming
short of it. Censure is like the Thunderbolt that commonly falls upon the
highest Mountains. It is convenient then to sleep sometimes, as the good Homer
did, and to affect certain failings whether in wit or courage, (but without
annoying reason) to appease ill will, and to hinder the imposture of bad humor
from breaking. That is the throwing of ones cloak before the Eyes of Envy, to
save reputation for ever after.

MAXIM LXXXIV.
To know how to draw advantage from Enemies.
All things are to be taken, not by the blade, which may hurt; but by the
handle, which is the way for defense. And upon better reason envy. The wise man
draws more advantage from his Enemies, than the fool does from his Friends. The
envious are as a spur to the wise man to make him surmount a thousand
difficulties: whereas flatterers many times divert him. Many owe their fortune
to their enviers. Flattery is more cruel than hatred, in as much as it
palliates the faults, which the other makes us remedy. The wise man makes the
hatred of his Enviers his looking-glass, wherein he sees himself far better
than in that of kindness. That looking-glass shows him the faults which he
corrects, and thereby prevents backbiting. For men keep upon their close guard,
when they have rivals, or Enemies for Neighbors.

MAXIM LXXXV.
Not to be lavish of ones self.
It is the misfortune of all that is excellent to degenerate into abuse; when
it is too much made use of. What all men passionately covet, comes at length to
displease all men. It Is a great unhappiness to be good at nothing; as also to
desire to be good at every thing. These always lose, through a desire of
gaining too much; and at long run they are as much hated, as they were favored
before. All perfections are obnoxious to this lot: so soon as they lose the
reputation of being rare, they get that of being common. The only remedy for
every thing that excells, is to be moderate in show. The excess ought to be in
the perfection, and the mean in the manner of showing it. The more light a
Torch gives, the shorter while it lasts. What is cut off from appearance and
ostentation, is fully made up in esteem.

MAXIM LXXXVI.
To arm against Calumny.
The vulgar has many Heads and Tongues, and by consequent more eyes also. Let
a bad rumor slip amongst these Tongues, that alone is enough to blemish the
highest Reputation: and if that rumor turn into a nickname, farewell all the
esteem that a man has acquired. These scoffs hit commonly upon certain obvious
defects, which, if they be singular, furnish ample matter of derision. And as
there are imperfections which private envy exposes to the eyes of public
malice: there are also sharp edged Tongues, which with a word blurted in the
air, destroy more suddenly a great Reputation, than others do with all their
impudence. It is very easy to have an ill name, because evil is soon believed,
and sinistrous impressions are very difficult to be obliterated. A wise man
therefore ought to be upon his Guard. For it is easier to prevent Calumny, than
to remedy it.

MAXIM LXXXVII.
To cultivate and embellish.
Man is born barbarous. He is ransomed from the condition of Beasts, only by
being cultivated. The more he is cultivated, the more he becomes man. In
respect of Education, Greece had reason to call all the rest of the world
barbarous. There is nothing so rude as ignorance; nor nothing that polishes
more than knowledge. But (knowledge it self is rude, if it be without art. It
is not enough that the understanding is cleared, the will must also be
regulated, and the manner of conversing more.) There are some men naturally
polished, whether as to conceiving, or speaking; as to the advantages of the
body, which are but as the bark; or of the mind, which are the fruit. There are
others again so clownish, that all their actions, and sometimes even the rich
Talents which they have, are disfigured by the ruggedness of their humor.

MAXIM LXXXIII.
To study to have a gentile Carriage in Actions.
A great man ought never to be punctilious in his proceedings. One must never
nibble too much at things, especially at those which are not agreeable. For
though it be useful to observe every thing by the bye, yet it is not so to
dive into them purposely. We ought commonly to carry with a gentile
indifference, which makes a part of Gallantry. To dissemble is the chief means
to govern. It is good to pass by a great many things that occur in the commerce
of life, but particularly amongst Enemies. The too much is always irksome, and
in humor it is unsupportable. It is a kind of madness to hunt after vexations.
And ordinarily such is the way of carriage, as the humor is in which one acts.
Our actions take the character of the humor we are in when we do them.

MAXIM LXXXIX.
Exactly to know ones Genius, Mind, Heart and Passions.
One cannot be master of himself, unless he know himself to the bottom. There
are looking-glasses for the face, but none for the mind. That then must be
supplied by a serious reflection upon ones self. When the external image is
gone, let the internal retain and correct it. Measure thy strength and skill
before thou undertake any thing. Know thy activity that thou may engage,
fathom thy depth, and examine how far thy capacity may reach in all things.

MAXIM XC.
The way to live long
Is to live well. There are two things which shorten the life, solly and
wickedness. Some have lost it, because they knew not how to keep it; others
because they would not. As virtue is its own reward, so is vice its own
executioner. Whoever lives fast in vice, dies soon, and that two ways: whereas
they who live fast in virtue never die. The integrity of mind is communicated
to the body: and a good life is always long, not only in the intension, but in
the extension also.

MAXIM XCI.
To act without fear of failing.
The fear of not succeeding, discovers the weakness of him that acts to his
Rival. If, even in the heat of passion, the mind is in suspense, so soon as
that first flash is over, he will upbraid himself with his own imprudence. All
actions that are done with doubting are dangerous, it were better to let them
alone. Prudence is not satisfied with probabilities, it goes always on sure
grounds. How can that enterprise succeed which fear damns, so soon as the mind
has conceived it? And if a resolution that has been unanimously taken in the
council of Reason, has often a bad issue, what is to be expected from that
which has wavered from the beginning in reason and prognostication.

MAXIM XCII.
A transcendent Wit in all things
Is the principal rule, whether for acting or speaking. The more sublime
employments are, the more that Wit is necessary. A grain of Prudence is worth
more than a barn full of subtilty. It is a way that leads to infallibility,
although it touches not so much upon plausibility. Though the fame of Wisdom
be the triumph of Renown, yet it will suffice to content the wise, whose
approbation is the touchstone of enterprises.

MAXIM XCIII.
The universal Man.
The man who possesses all sorts of perfections, is alone worth a great many
others. He renders life happy by communicating to others. Variety joined to
perfection is the recreation of life. It is great skill to know how to furnish
ones self with all that is good. And since nature has in man, as in the most
excellent of her works, made an abridgment of the whole Universe, Art ought
also to make of the mind of man an universe of knowledge and virtue.

MAXIM XCIV.
An inexhaustible Capacity.
Let a man of parts have a special care that no man sound the depth of his
knowledge and skill, if he would be reverenced by all. Let him suffer himself
to be known, but not to be comprehended. Let no man have that advantage over
him as to find out the bounds of his capacity, lest he may come to be
undeceived. Let him husband himself so well, that no body may see him entirely.
Opinion and doubting procures more veneration to him of whose wit and parts the
reach is not known, than when he is fully known to be what he is, let him be
never so accomplished and great.

The Author Comments excellently upon this Aphorism in the first Chapter of
his Hero.

As no man, says he, dares to cross a River on foot, until he has found out
the foard, even so a man is reverenced so long as one sees not the bottom of
his capacity, inasmuch as an unknown depth, and by consequent presumed to be
great, is respected out of fear. If he, who discovers, becomes the master of
him that is discovered, as the Proverb says: he that stands upon his guard is
never surprised. Let the address of a witty man way-lay the curiosity of him
that attempts to find it out. For it is in the beginnings of an essay that
curiosity employs all its cunning. If one cannot be infinite, he ought at least
endeavor to appear so. The wise man of Mitilene had reason to say, that the
half was more than the whole, seeing one half in show, and the other in
reserve, is better than a whole made manifest. Thou then who aspirest to
greatness, and art a candidate of Renown observe well this Precept. Let all men
know thee, but no man know thee thoroughly. By that industry thy little will
appear great; thy great more, and thy more infinite.

MAXIM XCV.
To know how to entertain another's expectation.
The way to feed it is always to give it fresh nourishment. Much ought to
promise more; a great action ought to serve for a spur to others greater. All
must not be shown at first time. It Is a piece of skill to know how to measure
ones strength according to necessity and time, and daily to discharge what is
daily expected by the public.

MAXIM XCVI.
Conscience.
Is the Throne of Reason, and the basis of Prudence. When that is consulted, it
is easy not to miscarry. It is a gift of Heaven, and being so important as it
is, cannot be too much desired. It is the chief piece of the Armor of Man, and
is so necessary to him, that it would be sufficient, though all the rest were
wanting. All the actions of life depend upon its influence, and are esteemed
good or bad, according as it judges of them, since every thing ought to be done
with reason. It consists in a natural inclination, which tends to equity, and
takes always the surer side.

MAXIM XCVII.
To acquire and preserve Reputation,
Is to have and to hold Fame. Reputation costs much in the purchase, because it
requires for that end eminent qualities, which are as rare as the indifferent
are common. Being once purchased, it is easy to preserve it. It animates much,
and acts still more. It is a kind of majesty, when it commands veneration, by
virtue of the sublimity of its cause and sphere. But that Reputation is the
most substantial, which always has been well supported.

MAXIM XCVIII.
To dissemble.
Passions are the breaches of the mind. The most useful knowledge is the art
to dissemble. He that shows his Game, runs the risque of losing it. Let
circumspection combat against Curiosity. Cover thine heart with a hedge of
diffidence and reserve, from those who nibble too nicely at words. Let them
never know thy disposition, lest they prevent thee either by contradiction or
flattery.

He who yields to his passions, says the Author, Chap. 2. of his Hero,
stoops from the state of a Man, to the condition of a Beast; whereas he that
disguises them, preserves his Credit, at least in appearance. Our passions are
the swoonings of our Reputation. He that can make a sacrifice of his will, is
Lord over himself. (To dive into the will of another, is a mark of a sublime
wit: to be able to hide ones own, is to get the superiority over another. To
discover ones thought, is to open the gate of the fort of the mind. Here it is
that politic Enemies give the assault, and most frequently with success too.
When once the passions are known, all the avenues and Sally-ports of the will
are known, and by consequent it may be commanded upon any occasion.) A complete
man must then in the first place apply himself to the subduing of his passions,
and then to the dissembling of them so artfully, that no spy can ever be able
to unmask his thought. This Maxim teaches one to become an able man, when he
is not; and so cunningly to hide all his imperfections, that all the
sharp-sighted spies of another man's road, lose their way in seeking it. That
Catholic Amazon of Sapin, (he speaks of Queen Isabelle, Wife to Ferdinand) may
serve as a pattern in that art. When she was to be brought to bed, she shut her
self up in the darkest and most secret place of her Palace; that by a veil of
darkness she might cover the sower faces and distorted looks that might be
forced from her in the agony of her labor, and hinder the shrieks and
complainings that might escape her in the extremity of pain, from coming to
peoples ears. If she observed so great measures of decency and majesty on such
occasions wherein every thing is excusable, how careful must she have been in
those where her Reputation was to be maintained?

MAXIM XCIX.
Reality and appearance.
Things are not taken for what they are, but for what they appear to be. There
is scarcely any one that sees into the inside, most part of men content
themselves with shows. It is not enough to have a good intention, if the action
look ill.

MAXIM C.
The Man undeceived. The Christian Sage. The Courtly Philosopher.
It is fit to be so, but not to appear to be so, and far less to affect to be
thought so. Though to Philosophize be the most worthy exercise of the wise, yet
it is now adays out of fashion. The learning of able men is despised. Seneca
having introduced it into Rome, it was sometime in vogue at Court, and at
present it passes there for folly. But Prudence and a good mind are not fed
with prejudice.

MAXIM CI.
One part of the World laughs at the other, and both laugh at their common
folly.
Every thing is good or bad, according to the whimsey of People. That Fool is
insupportable, who would have all things go according to his fancy. Perfections
depend not upon one single approbation. There are as many Opinions as Faces,
and as great difference amongst the one as the other. There is no fault without
an adherent, and thou ought not to be discouraged, if what thou do,
pleases not some, seeing there will always be others who will value it. But be
not proud of the approbation of these, since you will be still exposed to the
censure of others. The rule whereby to know what deserves esteem, is the
approbation of men of worth, and of such as are acknowledegdly capable of being
good judges of the thing. The civil life moves not upon one single opinion, nor
upon one single custom.

MAXIM CII.
A stomach that can well receive the large mouth-fulls of Fortune.
A great stomach is not the least part of the body of Prudence. A large
capacity has need of great parts. Prosperities cumber not him who deserves
greater. What cloys some raises an appetite in others. There are many who
receive prejudice from all juicy food, because they are of a weak Constitution,
and are neither born, nor bred up for so high employments. The commerce of the
world is bitter to their taste, and the steams of their vainglory, which mount
up to their brain, occasion dangerous giddinesses: high places make their heads
to swim, they cannot hold themselves, because their fortune cannot hold within
them. Let a man of Brains then show, that he has still a place left to lodge a
greater fortune in: and use all his industry to avoid every thing that may give
the least sign of a low courage.

MAXIM CIII.
Every one is to keep the grandeur that is proper for his state.
Let all thy actions proportionably to thy condition, be the actions if not of
a King, at least worthy of a King. That Is to say, carry Royally, as much as thy
fortune can allow. Let there be grandeur in thine actions, elevation in thy
thoughts, to the end, that if thou be not a King in reality, thou may be one
in merit.) For true Royalty consists in Virtue. He has no reason to envy the
grandeur, who may be the model thereof. But it concerns those chiefly who are
upon the Throne, or who approach near to it, to make some provision of true
superiority, that is to say, of the qualities of majesty, rather than to please
themselves with the Ceremonies, which vanity and luxury have introduced. They
ought to prefer the solidity of substance before the emptiness of Ostentation.)

MAXIM CIV.
To examine the nature of businesses.
Every employment has its way, he must be an essay-master that can judge the
difference of them. Some employments require valor, others quickness: some
demand only probity, and others again Artifice. The first are more easy, and
the others more difficult to be discharged. For performing the first, good
natural ability is sufficient, whereas for the others, all application and
vigilance is too little. It is a very painful office to have the government of
men, but much more to have the conduct of Fools and Beasts. A double portion of
sense is needful for ordering of those that have none. That is an
insupportable employment which requires a man's whole labor, is stinted to
hours, and has always the same thing to do. Those are much better wherein
variety concurs with importance, seeing change delights the mind. But the best
of all are such, which are least dependant, or whose dependence is most remote:
and that is the worst, which, when we come out of it, obliges us to render an
account to rigorous Judges, and especially when it is to God.

MAXIM CV.
Not to be tedious.
A man that has but one business, or he that has always the same thing to
say, is commonly tedious. Brevity is fitter for negotiation. It gains by
delighting what it loses by sparing. What is good, is doubly good, if it be
short: and in like manner what is bad, is less so, if there be little of it.)
Spirits operate better than mingled Potions. It is a known truth that a great
talker is seldom a man of parts. There are some men that give more trouble than
honor to the Universe. They are clouts thrown out into the Streets, which
every one kicks out of his way. A discreet man ought to have special care not
to be troublesome, especially to men of much business. For it were better to be
uneasy to all the rest of the world, than to one of those. What is well said,
is said in short.

MAXIM CVI.
Not to be proud of ones Fortune.
Ostentation of Dignity offends more than ostentation of person. To carry high,
is to become odious; it is enough to be envied. The more we hunt after
Reputation, the less we find it. Seeing it depends on the judgment of others,
no body can give it: and by consequent it must be merited and expected. Great
employments require an authority suitable to their Functions, and without that,
they cannot be worthily discharged. We ought to preserve all the authority that
is necessary for acquitting our selves of the main of our obligations: not to
make too much of it, but second it. All who pretend to be overcharged with
business, show themselves to be unworthy of their employments, as loaded with a
burden they are not able to bear. If any man would set himself off, let him
do it rather by a great personal worth, than by a borrowed character. Nay, a
King ought to gain himself more veneration by his own worth, than by his
Sovereignty, which is but an external thing.

MAXIM CVII.
Not to appear pleased with ones self.
To be dissatisfied with ones self, is weakness, and to be pleased, folly.) In
most men that satisfaction proceeds from ignorance, and ends in a blind
felicity, which, indeed, entertains pleasure, but preserves not the Reputation.
As it is rare to judge well of the eminent qualities of others, so men applaud
to themselves in those they have, how vulgar and ordinary soever they be.
Diffidence has always been useful to the wise, whether for taking such good
measures, that affairs did succeed; or for comforting themselves when they
succeeded not. For he that has foreseen the evil, is the less troubled at it,
when it happens. Sometimes Homer himself is asleep, and Alexander descends from
the Throne of his Majesty, and acknowledges his weakness. Affairs depend on
many circumstances, and what has succeeded at one time, has been unfortunate
at another. But it is the incorrigibility of fools, that they turn their
vainest thoughts into flowers, and that their weeds are always sprouting.

MAXIM CVIII.
The shortest way to become a great man, is to be able to choose his company.
Conversation is of great weight. Manners, humors, opinions, nay, and wit, are
insensibly communicated. So a hasty man should frequent the company of one that
is patient, and every one his contrary. By this means they will without any
labor attain to a fit temper. It is no small matter to be able to moderate
ones self. The alternate variety of seasons causes the beauty and duration of
the Universe. As contrariety makes the harmony of natural things, so the
harmony of civil society becomes more lovely by the difference of manners.
Prudence ought to make use of this policy in the choice of Friends and
Servants, and from that communication of contraries a most delightful temper
will arise.

MAXIM CIX.
Not to be Reprehensive.
There are some rough men that make a crime of every thing, not so much out of
passion, as of a natural disposition. In some they condemn all that they have
done; in others all that they would do: they so exaggerate every thing, that
they make of motes, beams in the eye. Their worse than cruel humor, would be
enough to turn the Elysian field into a Galley. But if passion mingle with it,
their rigor passes all bounds. On the contrary, Candor interprets every thing
favorably, if not the intention, at least the inadvertency.

MAXIM CX.
Not to wait, till one be a setting Sun.
It is a Maxim of Prudence to leave things, before they leave us. It is the
part of a wise man to make a triumph of his own defeat, in imitation of the
Sun, which, though still glorious in light, is accustomed to retire into a
Cloud, that he may not be seen to decline; and by that means leave it in doubt,
whether he be set, or not. He ought to draw out of the way of accidents, that
he may not pine away with fretting. Let him not stay till fortune turn her back
upon him, lest she should bury him alive, in regard of the affliction that it
would give him; and dead in respect of his Reputation. A good Horseman gives
his Horse sometimes the Reins, that he may keep him from rearing up, and
himself from derision, if he should chance to fall in the middle of the
carriere. A beauty ought to prevent her glass by breaking it, before it come to
show her that her charms are fading. See the Maxim 38.

MAXIM CXI.
To make Friends.
To have Friends, is a second being. Every Friend is good to his Friend.
Amongst Friends all things are pleasant. A man can be worth no more than what
others are pleased to value him at. To incline them then to that, we must seize
their mouth by their heart. There is no better charm than good Offices. The
best way to have Friends, is to make Friends. All the good we have in this
life, depends on others. We are to live with our Friends or Enemies. Every day
we ought to gain one, and if we make him not our confident, render him at least
well affected. For some of these will become intimates when they are thoroughly
known.

MAXIM CXII.
To gain the Heart.
The chief and sovereign cause of all things disdains not to prevent and
dispose it, when he has a mind to work the greatest works. By affection men
enter into esteem. Some trust so much to their merit, that they take no care to
make themselves be beloved. But the wise man knows well, that merit has a
great compass to fetch, when it is not assisted by favor. Good will
facilitates all things. It supposes not always that there is wisdom,
discretion, goodness, and capacity in the object; but it gives them. It never
sees faults, because it avoids seeing of them. Commonly it springs from a
material Correspondence, as being of the same Nation, Country, Profession or
Family. There is another kind of affection more formal and elevated: for it is
founded on obligations, reputation or merit. The difficulty is in gaining it;
for it is easy to preserve it. By our care we may acquire it, and then make
good use thereof.

MAXIM CXIII.
In Prosperity to prepare for Adversity.
Summer is the time when we can most commodiously make provisions for Winter.
In prosperity men have many Friends, and all things at a cheap rate. It is good
to lay up somewhat for bad weather. For there is want of every thing in
adversity. Thou Wilt do well not to neglect thy Friends, a day may come when
thou will think thy self happy to have some, whom thou carest not for at
present. Clownish people never have Friends, neither in prosperity, because
they know no body; nor in adversity, because then no body knows them.

MAXIM CXIV.
Never to stand in competition.
Every pretension that is contested, ruins the credit. Competition never fails
to blacken that it may darken. It is a rare thing to play fair play. Emulation
discovers faults, which civility concealed before. Many have lived in great
esteem so long as they had no Competitours. The heat of contradiction animates
or raises to life infamies which were dead: it digs up again the filth, which
time had almost consumed. Competition begins with a manifesto of invectives,
calling to its assistence all that it can, and ought not. And though sometimes,
nay, most times reproaches be arms of no great value, yet it makes use of them
for the satisfaction of a base revenge: and it runs upon that so impetuously,
that it covers the faults of the Rival with the dust of Oblivion. Good will
has always been peaceable, and Reputation indulgent.

MAXIM CXV.
To comply with the humors of those with whom one is to live.
Men are very well accustomed to look on ugly faces: they may then accustom
themselves to bad humors. There are some churlish Spirits, with whom, nor
without whom, one cannot live. It is Prudence then to be accustomed to them, as
to ugliness, if one would not be surprised, nor frighted on some occasions. At
first they terrify, but by little and little we grow acquainted with them,
reflection preventing what is rude in them, or at least helping us to bear with
it.

MAXIM CXVI.
To deal always with men who are careful of their duty.
One may both engage with them, and engage them. Their duty is their best
surety, even then when one is at variance with them. For they always act like
themselves: and besides, it is better to fight with honest men, than to triumph
over the naughty. There is no safety in dealing with wicked men, because they
never stand to what is just and reasonable. And therefore there is no true
Friendship ever to be found amongst them. How great soever their affection may
seem to be, it is always of base allay, because it has not any principle of
honor. Avoid always the man that has none; for honor is the throne of
honesty. Whoever esteems not honor, esteems not virtue.

MAXIM CXVII.
Never to speak of ones self.
To praise ones self is vanity; to blame, meanness. And what is a defect of
wisdom in him that speaks, is a trouble to those that hear him. If that be to
be shunned in familiar or domestic conversation, it is more to be avoided in
public, when one speaks and holds some great post, for then the least folly
passes for downright simplicity. It is the same error in Prudence to speak of
those who are present. For there is danger of splitting upon one of two rocks,
either of flattery or censure.

MAXIM CXVIII.
To affect the name of being obliging.
There needs no more but that, to become plausible. Civility is a chief part of
the knowledge how to live, it is a kind of charm that attracts the love of all
men: whereas Clownishness makes one hated and despised. For if incivility
proceed from pride, it deserves to be hated; if from brutishness, it is
contemptible. Too much does better in civility, than too little. But it ought
not to be alike to all; for then it would degenerate into injustice. It is even
a duty, and in use amongst Enemies, which shows the power of it. Whoever
honors is honored. Gallantry and Civility have that advantage, that all the
glory of them rests upon their Authors.

MAXIM CXIX.
Not to affect to be Churlish.
We ought never to provoke aversion, it comes fast enough without being sought
after. There are a great many people who hate at a venture, and know neither
how nor why. Hatred is readier than good will. Humor is more inclined to hurt,
than to do service. Some affect to be at odds with every body, either through
a spirit of contradiction, or because they are out of humor. When once hatred
has got possession of their heart, it is as hard to root it out again, as to
undeceive them. Men of wit are feared; backbiters are hated; the presumptuous
are despised; scoffers are abhorred; and the singular are forsaken of all men.
To be esteemed then, we must esteem. He that would make his Fortune, sets a
value upon every thing.

MAXIM CXX.
To comply with the Times.
Knowledge it self ought to be according to the mode, and it is no small piece
of wit to counterfeit the ignorant, where there is no knowledge. The relish and
language change according to times. We must not speak in the old fashion; the
relish must take with the new. The relish of good heads serves for a rule to
others in every profession, and by consequent we are to conform to it, and
endeavor to improve our selves. Let a prudent man accommodate himself to the
present, whether as to body, or mind, though the past may even seem better unto
him. In manners only that rule is not to be observed, seeing virtue is at all
times to be practiced. It is not known now adays, what it is to speak truth,
to keep ones word. If any do so, they pass for old-fashioned people. So that
no body imitates them, though all love them. Unhappy age, wherein virtue passes
for a stranger, and vice for a current mode! Let a wise man then live as he
can, if he cannot as he would. Let him be content with what lot has given him,
as if it were better than what it has denied him.

MAXIM CXXI.
Not to make much of nothing.
As there are some that perplex themselves about nothing, so there are others
who puzle themselves about every thing. They speak always like Ministers of
State. They take all things either literally or mystically. Few of those things
that occasion trouble, are to be minded: else we shall torment our selves much
in vain. It Is to act the clean contrary way, to lay that to heart, which we
should throw behind our backs. Many things that were of some consequence, have
signified nothing at all, because men troubled not themselves about them; and
others which signified nothing, have become matters of importance, because of
the value that was put upon them. In the beginning, it is easy to master all;
but not so afterward. Most commonly the remedy increases the evil. It is not
then the worst rule of living, to let things go as they come.

MAXIM CXXII.
Authority in Words and Actions.
That quality takes place every where, it presently commands respect. It shows
it self over all, in the Conversation, in Harangues, in the carriage, in the
look, and in the mien. To take hearts is a great conquest. That is not attained
to by a foolish bravery, nor by an imperious way of speaking, but by a certain
Ascendant that springs from the greatness of the Genius, and is supported by an
extraordinary merit.

MAXIM CXXIII.
The Man without Affectation.
The more there is of perfection, the less there is of affectation. For it is
that commonly which spoils the finest things. Affectation is as insupportable
to others, as it is painful to him that uses it, who lives in a continual
martyrdom of constraint, that he may be punctual in all things. The most
eminent qualities lose their value, if affectation be discovered in them,
because they are attributed rather to an artificious constraint, than to the
true character of the person. And what is natural, has always been more
agreeable than what is artificial. A man is looked upon to be a stranger to all
that he affects. The better one does a thing, the more he ought to hide the
care he takes in doing of it, to the end that all may take it to be natural.
But in avoiding of affectation, have a special care you fall not into it, by
affecting not to be affected. An accomplished man ought never to give the least
sign that he is persuaded of his own merit: the less he appears solicitous to
make it known, the more all will mind it. He is doubly excellent, who confines
all his perfections within himself, without bragging of any; he arrives at the
height of plausibility, by a way not much frequented.

MAXIM CXXIV.
How to be Regrated.
Few have that happiness, and yet it is an extraordinary one to be regrated by
good men. Commonly people are indifferent as to those who have finished their
time. There are diverse means of meriting the honor to be regrated. Visibly
eminent qualities in discharging ones office is a very sure one; and to please
all people is one effectual. Eminence begets dependence; so soon as it appears
that the office stood in need of the man that discharges it; and not the man of
the office. Some do honor to their places, and others are honored for them.
It is not an advantage to seem good, because one has a bad successor. For
that is not to be truly regrated, but only to be less hated.

MAXIM CXXV.
Not to be a book of Accounts.
It Is a sign of a bad Reputation, to take pleasure in blasting the Reputation
of another. Some are willing to wash out, or at least to cover their stains, by
exposing those of others. They ease the sense of their own defects, by
considering that others have faults also: which is the consolation of fools.
These have always a stinking breath, their mouth being the sink of civil
uncleanness. The more one digs into such matters, the more he bemires and
defiles himself. There is no man but has some original failing, whether to the
right or to the left. The faults of those who are not much known, are unknown.
Let a prudent man take good heed that he be not a register of Calumnies. That Is
the way to set up for a very unpleasant pattern, and to be without a Soul,
though one be alive.

MAXIM CXXVI.
To commit a folly makes not a fool; but not to know how to hide it, does.
If one ought to hide his passions, much more he ought his faults. All men
fail, but with this difference, that men of sense palliate the faults
committed, and fools show those they are about to commit. Reputation consists
more in the manner of acting, than in what is done. If thou be not Chaste, says
the Proverb, be cautious at least. The faults of great men are the more
remarkable, that they are the eclipses of great luminaries. How great soever
thy Friendship be, never trust it with thy failings. Nay, hide them even from
thy self, if it be possible. At least thou may make use of that other rule of
living, which is to know how to forget.

MAXIM CXXVII.
The secret charm, or the unexpressible somewhat; which the French call Le
Je-nesai-quoi. And the Spaniards El despejo.
Is the life of great qualities, the breath of words, the soul of actions, and
the luster of all beauties. Other perfections are the ornament of nature; the
unexpressible somewhat, that of perfections. It is observable even in the way
of reasoning. It holds much more of privilege than of study; for it is even
above all discipline. It is not limited to facility, but reaches the finest
Gallantry. It supposes a free and unstinted mind, and to that unstintedness it
adds the last strokes of perfection. Without it all beauty is dead, all
gracefulness ungracefull. It has the pre-eminence over valor, discretion,
prudence, nay, and majesty it self. It is a politic high way wherein affairs
are soon dispatched; and, in fine, the art of coming off gallantly when one is
hampered.

Here it will not be amiss for a Commentary, to give the translation of the
whole thirteenth Chapter of the Hero, where he gives a notion a little more
distinct of what he calls the Despejo.

The unexpressible somewhat, says he, is the soul of all qualities, the life of
all perfections, the vigor of actions, the gracefulness of language, and the
charm of all that takes. It agreeably amuses the conceit and imagination, but
it is inexplicable. It is something that enhaunces the luster of all beauties,
it is a metaphysical and formal beauty. Other perfections adorn nature, but the
somewhat adorns the ornaments themselves. So that it is the perfection even of
perfection, accompanied with a transcendent beauty, and universal gracefulness.
It consists in a certain taking air, in an agreeableness that has no name, but
which is seen in speaking, in the ways of acting, and in reasoning. What is
most lovely in it comes from nature, and the rest depends on reflection. For it
has never been subjected to any imperious precept, but always to the best of
every kind. It is called a charm, because it inchants hearts; a fine air,
because it is imperceptible; a brisk air, because of its activity; a taking
air, because of its politeness; jollity and good humor, for its facility and
complaisance. For the desire and yet impossibility of defining it, have got it
all these names. It Is to do it wrong, to confound it with facility; for that
comes but at a great distance after it. It advances as far as the finest
Gallantry. Though it suppose an entire disengagedness, yet it is devoted to
perfection. Actions have their Midwife, and they are obliged to this
unexpressible somewhat when they are well delivered. Without it they are
still-born, without it the best things are unsavory. Nay, it is not so much
the accessory neither, but that it is sometime the principal. It serves not
only for ornament, but also for support and direction in affairs. For as it is
the soul of beauty, so is it the spirit of Prudence, as it is the principle of
gracefulness, so is it the life of valor. In a Captain, it goes hand in hand
with bravery; and in a King with Prudence. In the shock of a battle, it is no
less conspicuous in its assured and undaunted air, than in the skill of
handling arms, and in resolution. It renders a General master of himself, and
then of all others. It is as impetuous on Horseback, as it is majestic under
the Canopy. In the Pulpit it gives a grace to words. By its golden thread,
Henry IV. The Theseus of France dexterously guided his way through the Labyrinth
of so many obstacles and affairs.

For a gloss to this description of the Despejo, which is very metaphysical
what Father Bonhours says in the fifth Conference of Aristus and Eugenius, may
serve.

It is far easier to perceive it, than to know it, says Aristus. It would be
no longer I know not what, if one knew what it were; its nature is to be
incomprehensible and inexplicable. And a page after. To take it right, it is
neither beauty, nor good mien, nor good grace, nor briskness of humor, nor
sparkling wit, seeing we daily see men, who have all these qualities, and yet
want that which pleases: and others, on the contrary, who please much, without
any thing that is agreeable, except this unaccountable luck. So that the
certainest thing that can be said of it, is that the greatest merit signifies
nothing without it, and that it needs no more but it self to work a very
great effect. It is to no purpose to be handsome, witty, blithe, etc. if the
unexpressible somewhat be wanting, all these fair qualities are, as it were,
dead: but also what imperfections soever one may have in body or mind, with
that sole advantage he is sure to please. This somewhat sets all to rights.
From thence it follows, says Eugenius, that it is an agreeableness which
animates beauty, and the other natural perfections, which corrects ugliness and
other natural defects; that it is a charm and an air that insinuates into all
actions and words; that enters into the gate, laughing, tone of the voice, and
into the least gesture of the person that pleases. And four or five pages
after. He says that the Spaniards have also their No so que, which they bring
in at every turn, besides their Donayre, their Brio, and their Despejo, which
Gracian calls, Alma de toda prenda, realce de los mesmos realces, perfeccion de
la misma perfeccion, and which according to the same Author, is above the
reach of our thoughts and words. Lisongea la intelligencia, y estrana la
explicacion. This I mention here, to show, that the Despejo, is an I know not
what, which has no name: and that all those that are given to it, are pretty
words, which the learned have invented to flatter their ignorance. These are
the terms of Father Bonhours.

MAXIM CXXVIII.
The high Courage.
Is one of the principal conditions required in a Hero, inasmuch as such a
courage spurs him on to all that is great, refines his discerning, raises his
heart, elevates his thoughts and actions, and disposes him to majesty. It makes
its way through, wherever it is: and when hard luck is cross to it, it essays
all ways to come off with honor. The more it is confined within the bounds of
possibility, the more it labors its enlargement. Magnanimity, Generosity, and
all Heroic Qualities, own it for their original.

The strong head, says Gracian, chap. 4. of his Hero, is for Philosophers;
the good Tongue for Orators; the Breast for Wrestlers, the Arms for Soldiers,
the Feet for Runners, the Shoulders for Porters, and the great Heart for Kings.
The Heart of Alexander was an Arch-heart, seeing a whole world lodged easily in
a corner of it, and that six more could have found room therein. That of Julius
Caesar was very great; seeing it found no mean betwixt all and nothing. The
heart is the stomach of Fortune. It digests alike her favors and disgraces. A
great stomach is not loaded with much food. A Giant is starved with that which
surfeits a Dwarf.

That Prodigy of Valor, Charles, Dauphin of France, and afterward King, the
seventh of that name, being informed that his Father, and the King of England
his Competitour, had got him declared in Parliament incapable of succeeding,
answered boldly, That he appealed from it. And when he was asked with
admiration, To whom? To my Courage, and the point of my Sword, Replied he. The
effect followed it. Charles Emanuel, the Achilles of Savoy, defeated four
hundred Cuirassiers, having but four men to stand by him: and perceiving that
all were surprised at it, he said, that in the greatest dangers, there was no
company so good as a great heart. The sufficiency of the heart supplies what is
otherwise wanting. The King of Arabia showing his Courtiers a Damask Cutlass
that had been presented to him, it was the opinion of them all, that the only
fault they found in it, was, that it was too short. But the Kings Son said,
That there was no Weapon too short for a brave Cavalier, seeing there needed no
more but to advance one step, to make it long enough.

MAXIM CXXIX.
Never to Complain.
Complaints always ruin Credit. They rather excite a passion to offend us,
than compassion to comfort us. They make way for those that hear them, to do
the same to us, that those have done, of whom we complain, and the knowledge of
the injury done by the first, serves the second for an excuse. Some by
complaining of past offenses, give occasion for future; and instead of the
remedy and consolation which they pretend, they give pleasure to others, and
even attract their contempt. It Is far better policy to publish the obligations
that one has to people, thereby to stir up others to oblige also. To speak
often of favors received from Persons absent, is to court the like from those
who are present; it is a selling the credit of the one to the other. Thus a
prudent man ought never to publish disgraces and failings, but always favors
and honors. And this serves to preserve the esteem of Friends, and to contain
Enemies in their duty.

MAXIM CXXX.
To do, and make it appear.
Things go not for what they are, but for what they appear to be. To know how
to do, and to know how to show it, is a double knowledge. What is not seen, is
as if it had no being. Reason it self loses its Authority, when it appears not
to be so. There are more mistaken men, than knowing men. Deceit carries it
cleverly, in regard that things are only considered by the outside. Many
things appear quite different from what they are. A good outside is the best
recommendation of internal perfection.

MAXIM CXXXI.
The procedure of a gallant Man.
Souls have their gallantry and gentility, from which arises a great heart.
That is a perfection not to be found in all sorts of men, because it supposes a
stock of generosity. Its first care is to speak well of Enemies, and still to
serve them better. In occasions of revenge it appears most conspicuously. It
neglects not these occasions, but it is only to make a good use of them, by
preferring the glory of pardoning, before the pleasure of a victorious revenge.
That is even a politic procedure, seeing the quaintest reason of state never
affects these advantages, because it affects nothing: and when right obtains
them, modesty dissembles them.

MAXIM CXXXII.
To advise and revise.
To revise is the surest way, especially when the advantage is certain: It is
always good to take time, whether it be for granting a thing, or for better
deliberating. New thoughts come into ones mind, which confirm and fortify
resolution. If the matter be to give, the gift is more esteemed, because of the
discerning of him that gives it, than for the pleasure of not having expected
it. What has been desired, has always been most esteemed. If it be a thing to
be refused, time facilitates the manner of it, by letting the No ripen, until
the season be come. Besides, most commonly so soon as the first heat of desire
is over, the rigor of a denial is taken with indifference. They who demand
with speed, are to be heard at leisure. That Is the true way to avoid being
surprised.

MAXIM CXXXIII.
Rather to be a Fool with all Men, than Wise all alone.
For if all be such, there is nothing to be lost, cry Politicians: whereas if
Wisdom be singular, it will pass for folly. Custom then is to be followed.
Sometimes to know nothing, or at least to seem so, is the greatest knowledge.
We must of necessity live with others, and the ignorant are most numerous. To
live alone, one must hold much of the Nature of God, or to be altogether of
that of Beasts. But for qualifying the Aphorism, I would say, Rather Wise with
others, than a Fool without Company. Some affect to be singular in Chimera's.

MAXIM CXXXIV.
To have a double portion of the things that are necessary for life.
Is to live doubly. We must not restrict our selves to one thing only, even
though it be excellent. All things ought to be double, and especially that
which is useful and delightful. The Moon that changes so often, is not so
variable as the will of man, so fickle is that same will. We ought therefore to
put a barriere to our inconstancy. Take it then for a chief rule of the art of
living, to have in a double portion all that serves for convenience. As Nature
has given us pairs of the Members which are most necessary and most exposed to
danger, so ought Art to double the things, whereon the happiness of life
depends.

MAXIM CXXXV.
Not to have a spirit of Contradiction.
For that is the way to become ridiculous, nay, and insupportable. Wisdom will
never fail to conspire against that Spirit. It Is to be ingenious to find
difficulties in all things; but it is foolish to be an Opiniatour. Such men
turn the sweetest conversation into a skirmish, and are by consequent greater
Enemies to their Friends, than to those that frequent not their company. The
more savoury the piece of fish is that we put into our mouth, the more we find
the bone that gets betwixt our teeth. Contradiction has the same effect in
pleasant Conversation. They are Fools and fantastical ones, that are not
satisfied to be Beasts, unless they be wild Beasts.

MAXIM CXXXVI.
To take things aright, and presently to nick the point.
Many fetch a tedious compass of words, without ever coming to the knot of the
business: they make a thousand turnings and windings, that tire themselves and
others, without ever arriving at the point of importance. And that proceeds
from the confusion of their understanding, which cannot clear it self. They
lose time and patience in what ought to be let alone, and then they have no
more to bestow upon what they have omitted.

MAXIM CXXXVII.
The Wise Man is sufficient for himself.
A Grecian Sage was to himself in stead of all things; and all that he had was
always with him. If it be true, that an universal Friend is sufficient to
render one as contented, as if he possessed Rome, and all the rest of the
Universe: be thine own Friend, and thou may live all alone. What more can be
wanting to thee, if thou have no sweeter conversation, nor greater pleasure
than with thy self? thou will only depend upon thy self, for it is a sovereign
bliss to be like the Sovereign Being. He that can so live all alone, will hold
nothing of the Beast, but much of the Wise Man, and all of God.

MAXIM CXXXVIII.
The Art to let things go as they can go, especially when the Sea is
tempestuous.
There are Tempests and Hurricanes in the life of man. It is Prudence to put
into a Haven, to let them blow over. Most commonly the Remedies increase the
Evil. When the Sea of humors is in agitation, let Nature work; if it be the
Sea of Manners, leave it to Morality. There is as much skill required in a
Physician, in not prescribing, as in prescribing: and sometimes the excellency
of the Art consists in applying no Remedy. The way then to calm popular gusts,
is to be quiet. Then to yield to the times, will get the victory afterward. A
Well will be troubled if it be in the least stirred, and its water becomes
clear again, by ceasing to dabble in it. There is no better remedy for some
disorders, than to let them alone. For at long run they stop of themselves.

MAXIM CXXXIX.
To know unlucky days.
For there are some, wherein nothing will succeed. It is to no purpose to
change the Game, the luck will still be the same. At the second bout, we are to
take heed, if luck be for us or against us. Understanding has its days. For no
man was ever alike able at all hours. There is good luck in reasoning truly, as
there is in writing a Letter well. All perfections have their season, and
beauty is not always in its quarter. Discretion sometimes belies it self, now
in ceding, and by and by in exceeding. In fine, to succeed well, one must have
his day. As all things succeed ill to some, so every thing prospers with
others, and that too with less pains and care: and some find their business
ready done to their hand. Wit has its days; Genius its Character; and all
things their star. When it is your day, you are not to lose a minute. But a
prudent man ought not positively to pronounce, that one day is happy, because
of his good success; nor that another is unlucky, because of his bad; the one
being, perhaps, but the effect of chance; and the other of mistimeing.

MAXIM CXL.
To hit at first upon the best of every thing.
Is the best mark of a good discerning. The Be goes immediately to the sweet,
that it may have whereof to make honey; and the Waspe to the bitter, to suck in
poison. It is so in discernings; the one sticks to the best, and the other to
the worst. In all things there is somewhat that is good, and especially in a
book, which commonly is made with study. Some are of so awkward a mind, that
amongst a thousand perfections, they will hit upon the only fault that is to be
found, and speak of nothing else, as if they were only cut out for common
sewers of the filth of the will and wit of others: and for keeping a Register
of all the faults which they see. That is rather the punishment of their bad
discerning, than the exercise of their subtilty. They spend their life ill,
because they only feed on naughty things. Happier are they, who amongst a
thousand faults at first discover a perfection that happened to be there by
chance.

MAXIM CXLI.
Not to listen to ones self.
It Is worth little to be satisfied with one self, if one content not others.
Commonly self-esteem is punished by universal contempt. He that pays himself,
remains a debtor to all others. It is misbecoming for one to speak, that he may
hear himself. If it be folly to speak to ones self, it is doubly so to listen
to himself before others. It is a fault in great men to speak with an imperious
tone: and that which stuns those who hear them; at every word they say, their
ears importunately beg applause or flattery. The presumptuous speak also by
echo: and since the conversation moves upon the stilts of Pride, every word
comes guarded with this impertinent exclamation: Rarely well said! Ah that is a
sweet saying.

MAXIM CXLII.
Never to espouse a bad party in spite to an Adversary, who has taken the
better.
He that does it, is half overcome, and at length will be constrained wholly to
yield. That is never a good way to be revenged. If thine Adversary has had the
skill to take the better, take good heed not to commit the folly of opposing
him, by espousing the worse. Obstinacy in actions engages so much the more than
that in words, that there is far more risque in doing, than in saying. It is
the custom of the head strong to regard neither truth in contradicting; nor
profit in disputing. A wise man has always reason on his side, and never falls
into passion. He either prevents or retreats. So that if his Rival be a Fool,
his folly makes him change his course, and go to the other extreme: whereby the
condition of his Adversary becomes worse. The only means then to make him
forsake the good party, is to strike in with it, seeing that will move him to
embrace the bad.

MAXIM CXLIII.
To take heed not to run into Paradoxes, by shunning to be vulgar.
Both extremes equally discredit. Every project that thwarts gravity, is a kind
of folly. A Paradox is a certain plausible Cheat, that at sirst surprises by
its novelty and its edge; but afterward loses its vogue, when the falsity of
it is once known in practice. It is a kind of quacking, which in matter of
Politics, is the ruin of States. They who cannot attain to Heroism, or who
have not the courage to advance toward it by the way of virtue, run into the
Paradox; which makes them to be admired by fools, but serves to manifest the
Prudence of others. The Paradox is a proof of an ill-tempered mind, and by
consequent, most opposite to Prudence. And if sometimes it be not founded on
what is false, it is founded at least on what is uncertain, to the great
prejudice of affairs.

MAXIM CXLIV.
Under the veil of another man's interest, to find ones own.
Is a most proper strategeme for obtaining what one intends. The Confessors
themselves teach this pious Craft as to what concerns salvation. It is a most
important dissimulation, seeing the profit that is pretended, serves as a bait
to attract the will. It seems to another that his interest goes first, when it
is only to make way for thy pretension. One must never enter hap hazard, but
especially where there is danger at the bottom. And when one has to do with
those, whose first word is always No, he must not show them what he aims at,
lest they may see Reasons for not condescending to it: and chiefly if he
foresee that they have an aversion thereto. This advice is for those that can
turn their wits to any thing; which is the quintessence of subtilty.

MAXIM CXLV.
Not to show the sore place.
For every one will have a hit at it. Have a care also not to complain of it,
seeing malice always attacks on the weaker side.) Resentment serves only to
divert it. Nothing pleases malice better than to put one off of the hinges. It
lets fall tart words, and sets all Engines at work, until it has found out
the quick. A man of parts then ought never to discover his evil, whether it be
personal or hereditary: seeing Fortune her self takes pleasure sometimes to
wound in that place, where she knows the pain will be sharper. It mortifies
always to the quick: and by consequent, one must never let it be known either
what mortifies, or what quickens; that he may make the one to cease, and the
other continue.

MAXIM CXLVI.
To look into the inside.
It is commonly found that things are far different from what they appear to
be; and ignorance that only looked on the bark, is undeceived so soon as it
goes in. The lie is always the first in every thing, it draws in Fools by a
vulgar They say, which runs from mouth to mouth; truth arrives always last, and
very late, because it has a lame Guide, which is time. The Wise keep for it
always one half of that faculty which nature has purposely made double. Deceit
is wholly superficial: and those who are so themselves, are presently catched.
Discerning retires inward, that so it may be the more esteemed by the wise.

MAXIM CXLVII.
Not to be inaccessible.
Let a man be never so perfect, he sometimes stands in need of Council. He that
will take none is an incurable fool. The most intelligent man ought to make
room for good advice. Sovereignty it self ought not to exclude docility. Some
men are incurable, because they are inaccessible. They precipitate themselves,
because no body dares come near them to hinder them from it. A door must then
be left open to Friendship, and by it relief will enter. A Friend ought to have
full liberty to speak, nay, and to reprove. The Opinion that is conceived of
his Fidelity and Prudence ought to give him that Authority. But withal, that
familiarity is not to be common to all. It is enough to have one secret
confident, whose correction is valued, and who is to be made use of as a
looking-glass for undeceiving.

MAXIM CXLVIII.
To have the Art of Conversing.
Is the means whereby a man shows his own value. Of all humane actions there is
none that requires greater circumspection, seeing it is the most usual exercise
of life. There is much Reputation to be gained or lost in it. If judgment be
necessary for writing a letter, which is a premeditated conversation by paper:
far more it is required in ordinary conversation, which brings the merit of
people under a sudden Test. The Masters of the Art feel the pulse of the Wit by
the Tongue, according to the saying of a Sage, Speak, if thou would have me
to know thee. Some maintain, that the true Art of conversing, is to do it
without Art: and that conversation, if it be betwixt good Friends, ought to be
as easy as ones clothes. For when it is a conference of Ceremony and Respect,
it is to be performed with more reserve, to show, that one has much of the
skill of living. The way to succeed well in that, is to follow the character of
those men's wit, who are as the judges of conversation. Take heed not to be vain
in censuring of words, which will make thee pass for a Grammarian; nor in
controlling and chopping reasons, for then all will avoid thee. To speak to the
purpose is more necessary than to speak eloquently.

MAXIM CXLIX.
To be able to cast the blame and misfortunes upon others.
It is a thing of great use amongst those who govern, to have Bucklers against
hatred, that is to say, men upon whom the censure, and public grievances may
light: and that is not the effect of inability, as malice imagines; but of an
industry elevated above the understanding of the people. Every thing cannot
succeed, nor all men be contented. There ought to be in that case then a strong
head, that may serve as a But to all the shot, and bear the reproaches of all
faults and miscarriages, at the cost of his own Ambition.

MAXIM CL.
To be able to put a value upon what one does.
It is not enough that things are good in themselves, because all men see not
to the bottom, nor are able to discern. Most part follow the multitude, and
stop not but where the greatest concourse is. It Is a great point to be able to
set an esteem upon ones Commodity, either by praising it; (for praise is the
spur to desire) or by giving it a pretty name, which is a good way to exalt:
but all this must be done without affectation. Not to write but for able men,
is an universal hook, because every one thinks himself to be so; and for those
who are not, privation will serve as a spur to desire. Ones projects must never
be called common, nor easy, for that is the way to make them be thought
trivial. All men are pleased with singularities, as being most desirable both
to the humor and mind.

MAXIM CLI.
To think to day what may happen to morrow, and a long time after.
The greatest foresight, is to have hours for it. There is nothing fortuitous
for those who forecast; nor any dangerous case for such as expect it. We must
not put off the thoughts of danger till we be sinking; we must be beforehand,
and by mature consideration prevent the worst that might happen. The Pillow is
a dumb Sibylle. To sleep upon a thing that is to be done, is better than to be
awaked by a thing already done. Some do first, and afterward think: which is
rather to look for excuses than expedients. Others neither think before nor
after. A man's whole life should be employed in thinking that he may not
mistake his way. Reflection and foresight give us the advantage of anticipating
life.

MAXIM CLII.
Never to keep company that may eclipse ones luster.
What excells in perfection, excells in esteem. The most accomplished will
always have the first rank. If his Companion have any part in the praise, it
will be but his leavings. The Moon shines, whilst she is alone amongst the
stars: but so soon as the Sun begins to appear, she either shines no more, or
disappears. Never approach him that may eclipse thee, but him that may set off
thy luster. In this manner Martial's cunning Fabulla found the way of appearing
beautiful, by the ugliness or agedness of her Companions. One must never run
the risque of being incommoded side-ways, nor do honor to others at the
expense of ones own Reputation. It is good to frequent the society of eminent
persons for shaping ones self: but when one is completed, to strike in with
those of inferior size. To model thy self, choose the most complete; and when
thou art fashioned, frequent the inferior.

MAXIM CLIII.
To shun being obliged to fill the place of a great Man.
If one engage in that, he ought to be sure to exceed him. For to equal a
Predecessor, one must have double his worth. As it requires Prudence and skill
in him that succeeds, to be such, as that he may be regrated: so likewise does
it Art, that he may have a care not to be eclipsed by him that went before him.
It is very difficult to fill up a great vacancy, seeing commonly the first
appears the best: and by consequent equality is not enough, because the former
is in possession. It is therefore necessary to surpass him, to dispossess him
of the advantage he has of being most esteemed.

MAXIM CLIV.
Not to be easy neither to believe, nor to love.
It Is an argument of maturity of judgment, to be hard to believe. Nothing is
more common than to lie, to believe then, ought to be extraordinary. He who is
apt to move, finds himself often put out of countenance. But special care is to
be had not to seem to doubt the credit of another: for that passes from
incivility to an offense, seeing it is to reckon him either a deceiver, or
deceived: nor is all the hurt there neither. For, besides that, not to believe
is the sign of a liar, the liar being subject to two misfortunes, not to
believe, and not to be believed. A suspension of judgment in him that hears, is
laudable: but he that speaks may refer to his Author. It is also a kind of
imprudence to be easy to love. For if one lie in speech, one may also lie in
fact: and that cheat is more pernicious than the other.

MAXIM CLV.
The Art of restraining Passions.
Let a prudent reflection prevent, if it be possible, the usual transports of
the vulgar. That will be no difficult thing to a prudent man. The first step to
moderation, is to perceive that we are falling into passion. By that means we
enter the lists with a full power over our selves, and may examine how far it
is necessary to give way to our resentment. With that swaying reflection, we may
be angry, and put a stop to it as we please. Strive to know where and when it
is fit to stop. For it is the hardest thing in running to stop upon the spot.
It is a great mark of judgment to stand firm and undisturbed amidst the Sallies
of passion. Every excess of passion degenerates from reason. But with this
magisterial circumspection, Reason will never be disordered, nor transgress the
bounds of its duty. To be able to devour a passion, we must always hold the
reins fast. He who governs himself in this manner, will be reckoned the wisest
man; as the foolishest if he do otherwise.

MAXIM CLVI.
Friends by Election.
Friends ought to abide the test of discretion, and the trial of fortune. It is
not enough that they have had the suffrage of the will, if they have not also
that of the understanding. Though that be the most important point of life, yet
there is least care taken about it. Some make their Friends by the intervention
of others, and most part by chance. We judge of men by the Friends he has. A
knowing man never chose ignorants. But though a man may please, we must not
therefore say that he is an intimate Friend. For that may proceed rather from
the pleasantness of his humor and ways, than from any assurance that one has
of his capacity. There are lawful Friendships, and bastard Friendships. These
are for pleasure; but the others for more security in acting. There are few
friends of the person, but many of the fortune. The good wit of a Friend is
better than all the good will of others. Take thy Friends then by choice, and
not by lot. A prudent Friend eases many troubles: whereas one who is not so,
multiplies and increases them. If thou would not lose thy Friends, never
wish them a great Fortune.

MAXIM CLVII.
Not to be mistaken in People.
That is the worst, and yet most ordinary mistake. It is better to be deceived
in the Price, than in the Commodity: And there is nothing that one ought more
narrowly to look into. There is a great deal of difference betwixt knowing of
things, and knowing of persons: and it is quaint Philosophy, to discern the
minds and humors of men. It is as necessary to study them, as to study Books.

MAXIM CLVIII.
To know how to use Friends.
That Is a thing that requires great skill. Some are good to be made use of at a
distance; and others to be near us. One that has not been fit for
Conversation, may be good for Correspondence. Distance effaces some certain
defects, which presence rendered unsupportable. In Friends we are not only to
look for pleasure, but for profit also. A Friend ought to have the three
qualities of a Being, or as the Schools say of an Ens: Unity, Goodness, and
Truth: in respect that a Friend stands in stead of all things. There are but
very few that can be given for good: and by not knowing how to choose them, the
number becomes less. To know how to preserve them, is more than to have been
able to make them. Look out for such as may continue long: and though in the
beginning they may be new, it is enough to content thee, that they may become
old. To take things aright, those are the best, which are not acquired, till we
have eat a bushel of Salt with them. There is no such horrid a Desert, as to
live without Friends. Friendship multiplies blessings, and divides crosses. It
is the only remedy against bad Fortune. It is the vent by which the Soul
discharges it self.

MAXIM CLIX.
To know how to bear with Fools.
Wise Men have always been bad-sufferers. Impatience grows with knowledge. A
vast reach is hard to be contented. In the judgment of Epictetus, the best
Maxim of life is to Suffer. He has placed one half of Wisdom in that. If all
impertinences are to be born with, without doubt there is need of much
patience. Sometimes we suffer most from those on whom we depend most; and that
serves to exercise us to patience. From suffering, springs that inestimable
peace, which makes the happiness of this world. Let him that finds not himself
in a humor to suffer, withdraw, if he be able to bear with himself.

MAXIM CLX.
To speak sparingly to our Competitours for Caution sake, and to others for
Civility.
One has always time to let slip his words, but not to retain them. We ought
to speak as men do in their last Wills, seeing the fewer the words are, the
less will be the Law suits. We are to accustom our selves to that, in matters
of no importance, that we may not fail in it, when it is important. Silence
holds much of Divinity. Whosoever is ready to speak, is always upon the point
of being cast and Convicted.

MAXIM CLXI.
To know the failings wherein one takes pleasure.
The most accomplished man has always some, whereof he is either the Husband
or Gallant. They are to be found in the wit, and the greater that is, the
greater, and more remarkable are they: not but that he who has them, knows
them; but because he loves them. To be passionate, and to be passionate for
vices, are two evils. These faults are the blemishes of perfection. They as
much offend those who see them as they please those who have them. Here is the
fair occasion for one to overcome himself, and to put the cap-stone upon his
other perfections. Every one levels at that work, and in stead of praising all
that is to be admired, stop short to Censure a fault, which, as they say,
disfigures all the rest.

MAXIM CLXII.
To be able to triumph over Jealousy and Envy.
Though it be Prudence to slight Envy, yet that contempt is a small matter now
adays: Gallantry works a far better effect. He cannot be sufficiently praised,
who speaks well of him, that speaks ill. There is not any revenge more Heroic,
than that which torments Envy, by doing good. Every good success is a strapado
for the envious man, and the glory of his Corrival is a Hell to him. To make
ones happiness to be a poison to his Enviers, is held to be the most rigorous
punishment that they can endure. Enviers die as often as they hear the praises
of the Envied revive. Both contend for immortality, but the one to live always
in glory, and the other always in misery. The Trumpet of Fame, which sounds to
immortalize the one, pronounces death to the other, by condemning him to the
punishment of expecting in vain that the cause of his pains should cease.

MAXIM CLXIII.
One must never lose the favor of him that is happy, to take compassion on a
Wretch.
Commonly that which makes the happiness of some, makes the misery of others:
and you may see one that could not be happy, if many others were not miserable.
It is the property of wretches to gain peoples good will. For all take pleasure
to gratify with an unprofitable favor, those who are persecuted by Fortune.
Nay it has sometimes happened that a man hated of all the world in his
prosperity, has been pitied by all people in his misfortune; the fall having
changed into compassion the desire of revenge. Let a man of wit then take heed
of the turns of Fortune. There are some that never associate but with the
unfortunate. He, whom they shunned yesterday because of his prosperity, has
them for Companions to day, because of his adversity. That Conduct is sometimes
the mark of a good nature, but never of a good wit.

MAXIM CLXIV.
To let fly some shot in the Air.
Is the way to know how that which is intended to be done, will be received,
especially, when they are matters, the issue and approbation whereof is
doubtful. By that means we are sure to hit our mark, and always at liberty to
retreat or advance. Thus we pump out men's minds, and know where it is best to
set our foot. That prevention is most necessary, for asking pertinently,
placing Friendship aright, and for governing well.

MAXIM CLXV.
To wage War fairly.
A brave man may, indeed, be induced to make War, but not to make it otherwise
than he ought. All men ought to act according to what they themselves are, and
not to what others are. Gallantry is most plausible, when it is used toward an
Enemy. We are not only to overcome by force, but also by the manner. To
Conquer basely is not to overcome, but to be Conquered rather. Generosity has
always had the advantage. A worthy man never makes use of forbidden Weapons. To
employ the wrack of an old Friendship, in framing a new hatred, is to use such
arms. For it is not lawful to take the advantage of a trust and confidence in
revenge. Whatever looks like treachery infects the good name. The least atome
of baseness is inconsistent with the generosity of great Souls. A brave man
ought to make it his glory to be such, that if gallantry, generosity and
fidelity, were lost in the world, they might be found in his heart.

MAXIM CLXVI.
To distinguish betwixt the man of Words, and the man of Deeds.
This distinction is as absolutely necessary as that of the friend of the
person, and the friend of the employment. For they are very different friends.
He is out of the way, who doing no bad Deeds, gives no good Words: And he again
more, who giving no bad Words, does no good Deeds. Now adays men feed not upon
words, seeing they are but wind; nor do they live on Civilities, these being
only a formal juggle. To go a birding with a light, is the true way to dazzle
the birds eyes. The vain and fools are content with wind. Words ought to be the
pledges of actions, and by consequent have their value. Trees that bear no
fruit, and have only leaves, have commonly no heart. It is necessary to know
them all; the one, to make profit of them; and the other, to stand under their
shade.

MAXIM CLXVII.
To be able to help ones self.
In troublesome encounters, there is no better company than a great heart: and
if this come to fail, it ought to be assisted by the parts that are about it.
Crosses are not so great for those who can tell how to assist themselves. Yield
not to Fortune. For she will become insupportable to thee. Some give themselves
so little help in their troubles, that they increase them, because they know
not how to bear them with courage. He that understands himself well, finds in
reslexion relief to his weakness. A man of judgment comes off in all things
advantageously, were it even to come down from the stars.

MAXIM CLXVIII.
Not to be Monstrous.
All the Hair-brained, Vain, Opinionative, Capricious, Self-conceited,
Extravagant, Fawners, Buffoons, News-mongers, Authors of Paradoxes,
Phanaticks, and in a word, all sorts of irregular persons: all these, I say,
are so many Monsters of impertinence. The ugliness of the Soul is always more
monstrous, than the deformity of body, seeing it more dishonours the beauty of
its original. But who shall correct so great and general a disorder? where
reason is wanting, direction has nothing to do: inasmuch as that which ought
to be the cause of a serious reflection upon that which gives occasion to
public laughter, makes men fall into the vanity of believing, they are admired.

MAXIM CLXIX.
To take more heed not to miss once, than to hit an hundred times.
When the Sun shines no body minds him; but when he is eclipsed, all consider
him. The vulgar will keep no account of your hits, but of your misses. The bad
are more known by murmurings, than the good by applauses: and many have not
been known until they fell. All good successes put together are not enough to
obliterate one bad one. Undeceive thy self then, and take it for a certain
truth, that Envy will observe all thy faults, but not one of thy good actions.

MAXIM CLXX.
To be sparing in all things.
That Is the way to succeed in matters of importance. One must not at every turn
employ all his Capacity, nor show all his strength. One must be sparing even in
knowledge: for that serves to double the value of it. There is a necessity of
having always something to trust to, when the question is how to get out of the
mire. The relief is more considerable than the fight, because it is always
accompanied with the reputation of valor. Prudence keeps always to the surer
side. And in that sense the ingenious Paradox is true: That the half is more
than the whole.

MAXIM CLXXI.
Not to abuse Favor.
Great Friends are for great occasions. Much favor is not to be employed in
matters of small importance: that is scattering of it. The sheet Anchor is
always reserved for the last extremity. If we squander away the much for the
little, what will remain for the next need? There is nothing now adays better
than Protectours, nor more precious than favor. It does and undoes, even so
far as to give wit, and take it. Fortune has always been as much a Stepmother
to the Wise, as Nature and Fame have been favorable unto them. It Is better to
know how to preserve our Friends, than our Estates.

MAXIM CLXXII.
Never to engage with him that has nothing to lose.
To do otherwise, is to fight at a disadvantage. For the other enters the
lists unconcernedly. Seeing he has lost all shame, he has no more to lose,
nor to husband; and so he runs hand over head into all extravagances.
Reputation, which is an inestimable value, ought never to be exposed to so
great risques. Having cost a great many years in purchasing, it comes to be
lost in a moment. A small breeze of wind is enough to freeze a great deal of
sweat. A Prudent Man is withheld by the consideration that he has much to
lose. When he thinks of his Reputation, he presently considers the danger of
losing it. And by means of that reflection he proceeds with so great reserve,
that Prudence has time to retire in time, and to secure his Credit. One can
never be able to recover by a Victory what he has already lost in exposing
himself to lose.

MAXIM CLXXIII.
Not to be a Glass in Conversation, and much less in Friendship.
Some are easy to break, and thereby discover their insolidity. They fill
themselves with discontent, and others with distate. They show themselves to be
tenderer than the Eyes, because they are not to be touched neither in jest nor
earnest. Motes even offend them; (for they have no need of Apparitions.) They
who keep them company, ought to put an extreme constraint upon themselves, and
study to observe all their nicities. There is no stirring before them, for the
least gesture disturbs them. Commonly they are a self-abounding kind of people,
slaves to their humor, and Idolatours of their silly point of honor, for
which they would turn the world topsie-turvey. He that truly loves, is of the
nature of a Diamond, both as to its lastingness, and its being hard to break.

MAXIM CLXXIV.
Not to live too fast.
To know how to distribute time, is to know how to enjoy life. To many there is
much of life remaining, but they want the felicity of it. They lavish away
pleasures: (for they enjoy them not,) and when they are gone on a great way,
they would be willing, if they could, to come back again. These are the
Postillions of life, who to the swift motion of time, add the rapidity of their
own minds. They would devour in one day what hardly they could be able to
digest in all their life time. They live in pleasures as men that would taste
of them all before hand. They eat up future years, and seeing they do all
things in haste, they have soon done with all. The desire of knowledge it self
ought to be moderated, that we may not know things imperfectly. There are more
days than prosperities. Make haste to do, and enjoy at leisure. It is better
to have affairs done than to do, and the contentment which lasts, is to be
preferred before that which ends.

MAXIM CLXXV.
The substantial Man.
He that is so, is not satisfied with those who are not so. Unhappy is that
eminence that has nothing substantial in it. All who appear to be men, are not
all so. There are some artificial men, that conceive Chimera's, and are brought
to bed of mistakes. There are others that resemble them, and set a value upon
them, being better satisfied with the uncertainty that a false show promises,
because the much is there; than with the certainty that offers truth, because
that appears little: but at long run their Caprices come to an unlucky end,
inasmuch as they have no solid foundation. Nothing but truth can give a true
Reputation; and nothing but substance turns to account. One cheat stands in
need of a great many others, and by consequent, the whole building is but
imaginary: and seeing it is founded in the air, it must of necessity fall to
the ground. An ill conceived design never comes to maturity. The much which it
promises, is enough to render it suspected: just so as the argument which
proves too much, proves nothing.

MAXIM CLXXVI.
To know, or to hearken to those who know.
There is no living without understanding, it must be had, either by nature, or
at second hand. Yet there are some, who are ignorant that they know nothing;
and others, who think they know, though they know nothing at all. The faults
that proceed from the want of wit, are incurable. For as ignorants know not
themselves, so they take no care to search for that they want. Some would be
wise, if they did think themselves so. Hence it is that the Oracles of Wisdom
be so rare, yet they have nothing to do, seeing no body consults them. It is
neither a diminution of Grandeur, nor a sign of incapacity to take Counsel: on
the contrary, one puts himself in the state of a knowing man by advising well.
Debate with thy Reason, that thou may not be beaten by ill fortune.

MAXIM CLXXVII.
To avoid too much familiarity in Conversation.
It is neither pertinent to practice it, nor to suffer it. He that familiarizes
himself, presently loses the Superiority that his serious air gave him, and by
consequent his Credit. The stars retain their splendor, because they mingle
not with us. By Divinizing, one gets Respect, by Humanizing, Contempt. The more
common humane things are, the less they are esteemed. For communication
discovers imperfections, that reservedness concealed. We must not be too
familiar with any body;) not with Superiors, because of danger; nor with
inferiors, by reason of Indecency: and far less with mean people whom
ignorance renders insolent, inasmuch that being unsensible of the honor that
is done them, they presume it is their due. Facility is a branch of a low mind.

MAXIM CLXXVIII.
To believe the Heart, and especially if it be a presaging Heart.
It is never to be contradicted: for it is accustomed to prognosticate what
most concern us. It is a Domestic Oracle. Many have perished, because they
were too diffident of themselves. But to what end should one distrust himself,
if he look not out for the remedy? Some have a heart that tells them every
thing: a certain mark of a rich stock. For that heart always prevents them, and
rings the allarum Bell upon the approach of evils, to make them fly to the
remedy. It is not the part of a wise man to go out and receive evils, but to be
beforehand with them and disperse them.

MAXIM CLXXIX.
To be reserved in speaking, is the Seal of the Capacity.
A Heart without secrecy is an open letter. Where there is depth, the secrets
are deep. For there must be much room and large spaces, where all that is
thrown in may be easily kept. Reservation proceeds from the great command that
one has over himself, and that is, indeed, a real triumph. We pay tribute to
as many as we discover our selves to. The security of Prudence consists in
internal moderation. The snares that are laid for discretion, are to
contradict, to draw out an explanation; and to glance biting words, to set one
in a flame. Then it is that a Wise Man ought to keep the closer! Things that
are to be done, are not to be told; nor are those that are fit to be told, good
to be done.) See the Maxim 279.

MAXIM CLXXX.
Not to take the design of an Enemy for the rule of our Measures.
A Blockhead will never do what a man of Wit thinks he should, because he is
not able to discern what is to the purpose. And if he be a prudent man, less
still; because he may go contrary to an advice that has been blowed upon, and
perhaps even prevented by his adversary. Matters ought to be examined on both
sides, and prepared for pro and con: so that one may be ready for the yea and
the no. Judgments are different. Indifference ought always to be attentive, not
so much for what shall happen, as for what may happen.

MAXIM CLXXXI.
Not to tell a lie, and yet not to speak all the truth neither.
Nothing requires more circumspection than truth. For to tell it, is to draw
the hearts blood. There needs as much skill to know when to tell it, as to know
when to conceal it. By on single lie, a man loses all his good name. Deceit
goes for false Coin, and the Deceiver for a Coiner, which is worse still. All
truths cannot be told: some, because they concern my self; and others, because
they concern a third person.

MAXIM CLXXXII.
A grain of boldness is worth a pound weight of skill.
It is good not to conceive such a high notion of people, as to become bashful
in their presence. Let never the imagination debase the heart. Some appear to
be men of importance, till others treat with them; but communication soon
undeceives the Credulous. No body goes beyond the narrow bounds of man. Every
one has his if, some as to their Wit; and others as to their Genius. Dignity
gives an apparent Authority; but it is rare, when the personal qualities answer
it. For fortune is wont to clog the Superiority of the employment, by the
inferiority of merits. Imagination is always upon the wing, and represents
things greater than they are: It conceives not only what there is, but what
there may be also: Reason having been undeceived by so many experiences, ought
to undeceive it. In a word, it neither becomes ignorance to be bold, nor
capacity to be bashful. And if Confidence be useful to them who have but a
small stock, upon stronger reason it ought to be useful to those who have a
great deal.

MAXIM CLXXXIII.
Not to be Headstrong.
All Fools are Opiniatours, and all Opiniatours are Fools. The more Erroneous
their Opinions are, the more they hug them. It is civil to yield, even in those
things wherein we have greatest reason and certainty: for then all know, who
had reason on their side: and besides the reason, Gallantry is also discovered
in the procedure. There is more esteem lost, by a wilful resistance, then
there is got by carrying it by open force. For that is not so much a defending
of truth, as a demonstration of Clownishness. There are knotty heads very
difficult to be cleft, and which always run upon some incurable extremity: and
when once whimsey joins to their head-strongness, they contract an indissoluble
league with extravagance. Inflexibility ought to be in the will, and not in the
judgment: though there be excepted cases too, wherein one is not to suffer
himself to be gained, nor doubly overcome; that is to say, both in the reason,
and in the execution.

MAXIM CLXXXIV.
Not to be Ceremonious.
The affectation of being so was heretofore censured as a piece of vicious
singularity, and that in a King too. Punctiliousness is tiresome. There are
whole Nations sick of that Nicety. The robe of silliness is wrought with small
stitch. These Idolatours of the point of honor give a demonstration, that
their honor is founded on a small matter, seeing they fancy every thing may
wound it. It is good so to carry, as to gain Respect, but it is ridiculous to
pass for a great Master of Compliments. It is very true, that a Man without
Ceremony has need of a great Merit in place of it. Courtesy ought neither to
be affected nor slighted. He shall never gain the esteem of an able man, who
sticks too much upon Formalities.

MAXIM CLXXXV.
Never to expose ones Credit to the risque of one single interview.
For if one come not well of, it is an irreparable loss. To fail once happens
often, and especially the first time. One is not always in the kue; whence
comes the Proverb: It is not my day. One must therefore endeavor; that if he
has failed the first time, the second may make amends for all: or that the
first may vouch for the second, that succeeded not. One ought always to have
his recourse to better, and to appeal from much to more. Affairs depend on
certain fortuitous cases, and on many too: and by consequence good success is a
rare good fortune.

MAXIM CLXXXVI.
To discern faults, though they be in fashion.
Though Vice be clothed in cloth of gold, yet a good man will still know it.
It is to no purpose for it to be apparelled in gold, it can never so well
disguise it self but that it will be perceived to be of iron. It would cloak it
self with the nobility of its Adherents, but it is never stripped of its
baseness, nor the misery of its slavery. Vices may very well be exalted, but
not exalt. Some observe, that such a Hero has had such a Vice, but they
consider not, that it was not that Vice which made him a Hero. The example of
great men is so good an Orator, that it persuades one to infamous matters.
Sometimes flattery has affected even bodily defects, without observing, that
though they be born with in great men, they are insupportable in the mean.

MAXIM CLXXXVII.
To act all that is agreeable to ones self, and all that is odious by others.
The one conciliates good will, and the other banishes hatred. There is more
pleasure in doing good, than in receiving it. It Is in that, that generous Souls
place their felicity. It seldom happens that one vexes another without being
troubled himself, either through compassion or retaliation. Superior causes
never operate, without reaping praise or reward. Let the good come immediately
from thee; and the evil by another. Take some body, upon whom the blows of
discontent may fall, that is to say the hatred and the murmurings. The anger of
the Rabble is like that of Dogs; not knowing the cause of its evil, it falls
upon the Instrument. So that the instrument bears the punishment of the evil
whereof it is not the principal cause.

MAXIM CLXXXVIII.
To bring always into company something to be praised.
That Is a means to make one esteemed a man of good discerning, and upon whose
judgment one may be assured of the goodness of things. He that has known the
perfection before, will be sure to esteem it afterward. He furnishes matter to
conversation and imitation, by unfolding plausible knowledges. It is a politic
way of selling Courtesy to those that are present, who have the same
perfections. Others on the contrary bring always with them something to be
blamed, and flatter the present, by despising the absent. This succeeds with
them, when they are in the company of those who only look on the outside:
seeing such observe not the cunning of speaking ill of some in presence of
others. Some think it a piece of Policy to esteem more the ordinary perfections
of to day, than the wonders of yesterday. A Prudent Man then is to have a care
of all these Artifices, (whereby these blades endeavor to attain to their
ends) that he may not be discouraged by the exaggeration of the one, nor puffed
up by the flattery of the others. Let him know, that both proceed the same way
with both parties, and only give them the alternative, by adjusting their
sentiments to the place where they are.

MAXIM CLXXXIX.
To make use of the needs of others.
If privation come the length of desire, it is the most efficacious constraint.
Philosophers have said, that privation was nothing, and the Politicians say,
that it is all in all. And without doubt these have best understood it. There
are some who to obtain their ends, make their way by the desire of others. They
lay hold of occasion, and stir up the desire by the difficulty of obtaining.
They promise themselves more from the heat of passion, than from the
lukewarmness of possession. Insomuch that the desire enflames the more as the
resistance grows greater. The true secret of attaining to ones ends is, to keep
people always in dependence.

MAXIM CXC.
To be satisfied in all conditions.
Even they who are useless, have the consolation that they are eternal. There
is no trouble but has its satisfaction. Luck for the fools, and chance for the
ugly, says the Proverb. To live long, there needs no more but to be of little
worth. The cracked pot seldom breaks, it lasts commonly till people be weary of
using it. It would seem that fortune envies men of importance, seeing it joins
duration with incapacity in some, and short life to much merit in others. All
they who by right ought to live, always fail in good fortune: and such as are
good for nothing, you will find to be eternal, whether because they appear to be
so, or because in effect they are so. It seems that destiny and death are
agreed to forget the unfortunate.

MAXIM CXCI.
Not to be gulled with excessive Courtesy.
For it is a kind of Cheat. There are some who stand not in need of the herbs of
Thessaly to bewitch with, for they charm fools and vain people merely with a
low Bow. They make a Traffic of Honor, and pay for it with the wind of some
fair words. He that promises all promises nothing, and promises are so many
slippery steps for fools. True Courtesy is a debt, that which is affected and
uncommon, is a Cheat. It is not a civility, but a dependence. They make not the
Bow to the Person, but to the Fortune. Their flattery is not an acknowledgment
of merit, but a bait to the profit, which they hope for. See the Maxim 118.

MAXIM CXCII.
The peaceable man is the long lived man.
Live, and let live. Peaceful men not only live but reign. We must hear and
see, but withal, hold our peace. The day spent without contention, makes us
spend the night in sleep. To live much, and to live with pleasure, is the life
of two: and it is the fruit of internal peace. That man has all, who does not
at all care for what concerns him not. There is nothing more impertinent, than
to lay to heart that which touches us not, or not to be affected with that
which concerns us.

MAXIM CXCIII.
Watch strictly over him that engages in thy interests, to come off with his
own.
There is no better preservative against Cunning, than Caution. A word to the
wise. Some do their own business by seeming to do another man's. So that if
one have not the key of intentions, he is forced at every turn to burn his own
fingers, to save other men's goods from the fire.

MAXIM CXCIV.
To have a modest Opinion of ones self, and of his affairs, especially when he
does but begin the world.
All People have high Conceits of themselves, and especially they who signify
least. Every one fancies to himself a brave Fortune, and imagines himself to be
a Prodigy. Hope engages rashly, and then experience seconds it in nothing.
Reality is the executioner of a vain imagination by undeceiving it. Prudence
then ought to correct such extravagances: and though it be allowable to desire
the best, yet we ought always to expect the worst, that so we may take all that
happens patiently. It is dexterity to take ones aim a little higher, that he
may hit the juster, but he ought not to shoot so high, as to fail at the first
shot. That reformation of imagination is necessary, for vanity without
experiences makes men only to dote. A good understanding is the most universal
remedy against all impertinences. Let every one know the sphere of his own
activity, and condition. That will teach a man to square the opinion of himself
according to reality.

MAXIM CXCV.
To be able to judge.
There is no man but may be another's Master in some thing. He that exceeds,
finds always some body that exceeds him. To know how to pick out the best of
every thing, is a useful knowledge. The Wise Man esteems all men, because he
knows what is good in every one, and what things cost in doing of them well. The
Fool despises all, in respect that he is ignorant of what is good, and always
chooses the worst.

MAXIM CXCVI.
To know ones Planet.
There is no man so miserable, but that he has his Planet: and if he be
unfortunate, it is because he knows it not. Some have access to Princes, and
great Men, and know neither how, nor why; unless it be that their luck has
made way for them. So that they need only a little industry to preserve
favor. There are others born as it were to please the Wise. One man has been
more acceptable in one Country than another, and better received in this City
than in that. One man happens also to be more fortunate in one employment, than
in all others, though he be neither more nor less capable of all. Destiny makes
and unmakes how and when it pleases. Every one then ought to labor to know his
Destiny, and to try his Minerva; on which depends all the loss and all the
gain. Let him know how to comply with his fate, and take good heed he attempt
not to change it. For that would be to forsake the North-star in his course.

MAXIM CXCVII.
Never to be hampered with Fools.
It is a perplexity not to know them, and much more for him that knows them not
to rid his hands of them. It is dangerous to keep them Company, and pernicious
to admit them to our Confidence. For though their own timerousness, and the Eye
of another may for some time keep them in awe, yet their extravagance will
break out at long-run, seeing they have only deferred the showing of it, that
they might do it with more solemnity. It is very difficult for him that cannot
keep his own Credit, to maintain another Man's. Besides, Fools are extremely
unhappy. For misery is fastened to impertinence, as the skin to the bone. They
have only one thing that is not so very bad. And that is, that as the Wisdom
of others signifies nothing to them, so on the contrary, they are very useful
to the Wise, whom they instruct and caution at their own proper cost.

MAXIM CXCVIII.
To know how to transplant ones self.
There are some, who, to set off their own value, are obliged to change
Countries, especially if they aspire to great places. Ones Country is the
Stepmother to eminent Qualities. Envy reigns there as in its Native Land. Men
remember better the imperfections that one had in the beginning, than the
merit, whereby he is advanced to grandeur. A Pin has been esteemed a thing of
value, when carried from one world into another: and sometimes a glass brought
from a-far, has made a Diamond to be undervalued. Every thing that is foreign,
is esteemed, whether because it comes from a far Country; or because it is
found to be complete, and in its perfection. We have seen men who have been the
refuse of a little Canton, and are now the honor of the World, being equally
reverenced by their Contrymen and Strangers; by the one, because they are
far off, and by the others, because they are come from a-far. He will never
have great veneration for a Statue, who has seen it the stump of a Tree in a
Garden.

MAXIM CXCIX.
To be a Wise Man, and not an intrieguing Man.
The shortest way to attain to Reputation, is the way of merit. If industry be
founded on merit, it is the true way of obtaining it. Integrity alone is not
sufficient; and the only Intrieguer deserves it not: inasmuch that matters are
then so defective, that they infect the Reputation. It is then requisite both
to have merit, and to know how to bring ones self into play.

MAXIM CC.
To have always something still to desire, that one may not be unhappy in his
happiness.
The body breaths, and the mind aspires. If one enjoyed all things, he would be
disgusted with every thing. Nay, it is even necessary for the satisfaction of
the understanding, that there remain always something to be known, for feeding
Curiosity. Hope gives life, and the glut of pleasure makes the life a burden.
In matter of reward, it is prudent not to give it all at once. When there is no
more to be desired, every thing is to be feared: and that is an unhappy
felicity. Fear begins where desire ends.

MAXIM CCI.
All who appear Fools, are so, and one half also of those who appear not to be.
Folly has taken possession of this World, and if there be the least wisdom
in it, it is more folly in respect of the wisdom from above. But the greatest
Fool is he that thinks himself wise, and accuses all others of folly. To be
wise, it is not sufficient to seem so, and far less to seem so to ones self. He
is so, that thinks not himself to be so: and he who perceives not, that others
see, sees not himself. Though the world be so full of Fools and Blockheads, yet
no body believes himself to be one, nor so much as suspects it.

MAXIM CCII.
Sayings and Actions render a Man accomplished.
We must speak well, and act well. The one shows a good head, and the other a
good heart: and both spring from a superiority of mind. (Words are the shadow
of actions. Saying is the Female, and doing the Male. It is better to be the
subject of a Panegyric, than the Panegyrist. It is better to receive praises,
than to give them. To say is easy; but to do, difficult. Brave actions are
the substance of life, and good sayings the ornament of it. The excellence of
actions is permanent, that of words transient.) Actions are the fruit of
reslexions. Some are wise, others valiant.

MAXIM CCIII.
To know the Excellencies of ones Age.
They are not very numerous. There is but one Phoenix in the world. Hardly is
there to be found in an age a great General, a perfect Orator, a Sage. And an
excellent King is to be looked for in many ages. Mediocrities are common, both
for number, and for esteem: but Excellencies are every way rare, because they
require an accomplished perfection: and the higher the form, the harder it is
to get to be Captain of it. Many have usurped the Surname of Great from Caesar
and Alexander, but all in vain. For without the actions, the voice of the
people is but a little air. There have been but few Seneca's, and Fame has
celebrated but one Apelles.

MAXIM CCIV.
What is easy ought to be set about, as if it were difficult; and what is
difficult as if it were easy.
The one for fear of slackening through too much confidence; and the other for
fear of losing courage through too much apprehensiveness. The way to fail in
doing of a thing, is to reckon it already done: on the contrary, diligence
surmounts impossibility. As to great enterptizes, we must not stand reasoning,
it is enough that we embrace them when they present, lest the consideration of
their difficulty make us abandon the attempt.

MAXIM CCV.
To know how to make use of Contempt.
The true secret for obtaining the things which one desires, is to undervalue
them. Commonly they are not to be found when they are sought: whereas they
offer themselves, when one cares not for them. As the things of this World are
the shadow of those in Heaven, so have they that property of a shadow, that
they fly from him that follows them, and pursue him who flies from them.
Contempt also is the most politic revenge. It Is the general Maxim of the
wise, never to defend themselves with the Pen, because it leaves tracts, that
turn more to the glory of their Enemies, than to their humiliation. Besides
that, that kind of defense gives more honor to envy, than mortification to
insolence. It Is cunning in inconsiderable persons to vie with great men, that
they may get themselves Credit by an indirect way, when they cannot have it by
right. (Many men had never been known, if excellent Adversaries had not taken
notice of them.) There is no higher revenge, than Oblivion. For it is the
burying of these men under the dust of their own nullity. Rash blades imagine
to purchase to themselves an eternal fame, by setting fire to the Wonders of
the world, and ages. The art of repressing Calumny, is, not to mind it. To
answer it, is, to do prejudice to ones self. To be offended thereat, is, to
discredit ones self, and to give envy ground of satisfaction. For there needs
no more but that shadow of defect, if not for obscuring a perfect beauty
entirely, at least for depriving it of its liveliest luster.

MAXIM CCVI.
We must know that the vulgar humor is every where.
Even at Corinth, and in the most accomplished Family. Every one has the
experience of it in his own house. There is not only a vulgar, but a doubly
vulgar humor, which is worse. This has the same properties with the Rabble,
just so as the pieces of a broken Looking-glass have all the same transparency:
but it is far more dangerous. It speaks foolishly, and censures impertinently.
It is the great Disciple of ignorance, the Godfather of silliness, and the near
Cousin of quacking. (We must not mind what it says, and far less what it thinks.
It is convenient to know it, that we may get rid of it, so that we be neither
it is companion nor object. For all silliness is of the nature of the Rabble,
and the vulgar is only made up of Fools.

MAXIM CCVII.
To use Retention.
We ought to mind what we do, especially on unexpected occasions. The
eruptions of Passions are so many slippery places that make Prudence to slide.
There lies the danger of being undone. A man engages farther in a minute of
rage or pleasure, than in many hours of indifference. Sometimes a little
pelting fret costs a repentance, that lasts as long as life. Other men's Malice
lays ambushes for Prudence, that it may discover footing. It makes use of that
kind of rack, for extorting the most hidden secret of the heart. Retention then
must raise the counter-battery, and particularly on hot occasions. There
needs much reflection to keep a Passion in order. He is a wise man that leads
it by the Bridle. Who knows there is danger, counts his steps. A word seems as
offensive to him that catches at it, and weighs it, as it appears of little
consequence to him that spoke it.

MAXIM CCVIII.
Not to die the death of a Fool.
Wise Men die commonly poor in Wisdom: on the contrary, Fools die rich in
Council. To die like a Fool, is to die of too much Logic. Some die, because
they feel, and others live because they feel not. So that the one are Fools,
because they die not of feeling, and the others because they die of it. That
man is a fool, who dies of too much understanding. So that some die to be
Understanding Men, and other's live, not to be understood. But though many die
like Fools, yet very few Fools die.

MAXIM CCIX.
Not to imitate the folly of others.
Is an effect of rare wisdom; for whatever is introduced by example and
custom, is of great force. Some who have guarded against particular ignorance,
have not been able to avoid the general. It Is a common saying, that no man is
content with his own condition, though it be the best: nor dissatisfied with
his wit, though it be the worst. Every one envies the happiness of another,
because he is not content with his own. Modern men praise ancient things, and
those that are here, things that are there. All that is past seems best, and all
that is remote is most esteemed. He is as great a Fool that laughs at all
things, as he that vexes at every thing.

MAXIM CCX.
To know how to make use of truth.
Truth is dangerous, but yet a good man cannot forbear to speak it. And in that
there is need of art. The skillful Physicians of the Soul have essayed all
means to sweeten it. For when it touches to the quick, it is the quintessence
of bitterness. Discretion in that particular unfolds all its address: with the
same truth it flatters one, and kills another. We ought to speak to those that
are present, under the name of the absent or dead. To the understanding, a sign
is enough: and if that be not sufficient, the best expedient is to hold ones
peace. Princes are not cured by bitter Medicines. It requires art to guild
their Pill.

In the third Critic of the third part of the Authors Criticon, he says,
That after many consultations about the means of recalling Truth into the
world, from whence men had banished it, to put falsehood in its place, it was
resolved to make it up in a great quantity of Sugar, for qualifying the
bitterness of it, and then to do it over with the Powder of Amber, to take
from it its strong and unpleasant smell. After that it should be given to men
to drink in a Golden Cup, and not in a Glass, least it might be seen through
it: telling them that it was an excellent liquour, brought from a-far, and more
precious than Chocolate, Coffee or Sarbet. Then he adds. They began with
Princes, to the end that in imitation of them all men might drink of it. But
seeing they have a very delicate smelling, they smelt the bitterness of that
drink at a Leagues distance, which began to turn their stomach, and force them
to vomit, etc. And in his Discreet, in the Dialogue entitled, El Buen
entendedor, he brings in a Doctor, saying; to speak truth now adays, is
called brutishness and folly. And he makes answer. And therefore no body will
speak it to those who are not accustomed to hear it. There remain only now
some scraps of it in the world, nor do these neither appear, but with mystery,
ceremony, and circumspection. With Princes, (replies the Doctor) men always
fetch a compass. It concerns them then to take good heed to that, (answers
Gracian) inasmuch as the losing or gaining of all lies thereby at stake.
(Verity, adds the Doctor, is a Maid no less modest than beautiful: and that is
the reason why she goes always veiled. But Princes then, (replied Gracian,)
ought gallantly to uncover her.) It concerns them much to be good Diviners, and
sharpsighted Linxes, that they may dive in truth, and discern falsehood. The
more every one studies to mutter only the truth to them between their teeth,
the more they give it them ready chewed, and easy to be digested, to the end
it may do them the more good. At present undeception is politic, it goes
commonly betwixt two lights, either that it may get out of the darkness of
flattery, if it meet a Fop; or that it may advance to the light of truth, if it
meet with a Man of wit.

MAXIM CCXI.
In Heaven all is pleasure; in Hell all pain. The world being in the middle,
has a share of both.
We are betwixt two extremes, and so we participate of both. There is an
alternative of destiny, neither can all be happiness, nor all unhappiness. This
world is a cipher, all alone it is of no value, joined to Heaven it is worth a
great deal. It is wisdom to be indifferent as to all its changes, for Novelty
moves not the wise. Our life is acted like a Play. The Catastrophy is in the
last Act. The chief part then is, to end it well.

MAXIM CCXII.
Not to discover the mystery of ones Art.
Great Masters use this Cunning, even when they teach their Trade. One must
always preserve a Superiority, and continue to be Master. There is need of Art
in communicating ones Art, the source of teaching, and that of giving must
never be drained. That Is the means of preserving Reputation and Authority. To
have always somewhat that may feed admiration, by advancing things still to
greater perfection, is a great precept to be observed in the matter of pleasing
and teaching. In all sorts of Professions, and particularly in the most sublime
employments, not to be lavish of ones self, has been a great rule for living
and prevailing.

MAXIM CCXIII.
To know how to contradict.
It is an excellent stratagem, when one can do it, not to be engaged, but to
engage. It is the only Rack that can extort Passions. Slowness in believing is
a Vomitive that brings up secrets, and a Key that can open the best locked
heart. To sound both the will and judgment, requires great dexterity. A sly
contempt of some mysterious words of another's, hunts out the most impenetrable
secrets, and pleasantly wheadles them to the point of the Tongue, that they may
so be caught in the toils of artifice.) The reservedness of him who stands upon
his guard, makes his spy draw off to a distence: and so he discovers the
thought of another, which otherwise was impenetrable. An affected Doubt is a
false Key of a cunning contrivance, whereby Curiosity unlocks all that it has
a mind to know.) In matter of learning it is a cunning fetch in the Scholar to
contradict his Master, inasmuch as it lays an obligation upon him, to labor to
explain the truth with greater perspicuity and solidity.) So that moderate
contradiction gives him that teaches occasion to teach thoroughly.

MAXIM CCXIV.
Of one Folly not to make two.
Nothing more ordinary than after one has committed one piece of foppery, to
do three or four more in making amends for it. One impertinence is excused by
another greater. Foppishness is of the race of Lying, or this of the race of
that: to make good one, there is need of a great many others. The defense of a
bad Cause, has always been worse than the Cause it self. Not to know how to
cover the evil, is a greater evil than the evil it self. The revenue of
imperfections is, to let out a great many others to Rent. The wisest man may
very well fail once, but not twice; transiently, and by inadvertency, but not
deliberately. See the Maxim 261.

MAXIM CCXV.
To have an eye over him that looks one way, and rows another.
It Is the stratagem of a man of business to amuse the will that he may attack
it. For so soon as it is convinced it is overcome. He dissembles his
intention, that he may attain to it: he puts himself in the second rank, that
he may be the first in execution. He makes sure of his blow through the
inadventency of his Adversary. Let not then thy attention sleep, since the
intention of thine adversary is so vigilant. And if the intention be the second
in dissimulation, the discerning ought to be the first in knowledge. It is an
act of circumspection to find out the artifice that one makes use of, and to
observe the aims he takes for hitting the ends of his intentions. Seeing he
proposes one thing, and pretends another, and that he turns and winds, that he
may slily reach his ends, we are to look well about us what we grant to such an
one; and sometimes it will not even be amiss to let him know that we have
discovered his designs.

MAXIM CCXVI.
To speak clearly.
That shows not only a disengagedness, but also a vivacity of wit. Some
conceive well, and bring forth ill. For without light the Children of the Soul,
that is to say, thoughts and expressions, cannot come into the World. There are
some, much like to those pots, which hold much, and let little out: On the
contraray, others say more than they know. What resolution is in the will,
expression is in the understanding. They are too great perfections. Clear Wits
are plausible; confused heads have been admired, because not understood.
Sometime obscurity is graceful, to distinguish one from the Rabble. But how
can others judge of what they hear, if those who speak, conceive not themselves
what they say?

MAXIM CCXVII.
We must neither love, nor hate for ever.
Live to day with thy Friends, as with those who to morrow may be thy worst
Enemies.) Seeing that is found by experience, it is very reasonable to be upon
ones guard. Have a care not to give Arms to the deserters of Friendship,
inasmuch as they will fight with them more cruelly against thy self. On the
contrary, in regard of thine Enemies, leave always a door open to
reconciliation, to wit, that of Gallantry, which is the surest. Sometimes
former revenge has been the cause of future repentance, and the pleasure of
doing evil, turns into the displeasure of having done it.

MAXIM CCXVIII.
To do nothing whimsically, but every thing with circumspection.
Every whimsey is an imposthume. It is the eldest son of passion, that does all
things the backward way. There are some who turn every thing into a kind of
skirmishing. They are Ruffians in Conversation; and would make a triumph of
every thing they do. They know not what it is to be peaceful. In commanding
and governing they are pernicious, because they turn Government into a league
offensive, and form a party of Enemies of those whom they ought to look upon as
Children. They Will have all things go in their way, and carry every thing as the
result of their Conduct. But so soon as men discover their paradoxical humor,
they stand upon their guard against them; their Chimera's are flung back to
them again: and by consequent they are so far from gaining their point, that
they heap up to themselves vexations, every one lending a hand to their
mortification. These silly people have a cracked brain, and sometimes also an
unsound heart. The way to get rid of such Monsters, is to fly to the
Antipodes, the barbarity whereof will be more supportable than the fierce and
haughty humor of these men.

MAXIM CCXIX.
Not to pass for a Crafty Man.
The truth is, there is no living now adays without using it. But it is better
to choose to be prudent than cunning. An open humor is agreeable to all men,
but a great many love not to have it. Sincerity ought not to degenerate into
simplicity, nor Wisdom into Artifice. Better it is to be respected as Wise,
than feared as Crafty. Sincere People are loved, but deceived. It is the
greatest cunning to hide that which passes for cheating. Candor flourished in
the golden Age, Malice has its turn in this age of Iron. The reputation of
knowing what one has to do, is honorable, and procures confidence; but that
of being artificious, is sophistical, and begets distrust.

MAXIM CCXX.
To cover our selves with the Foxe's skin, when we cannot do it with the
Lyon's.
[To yield to the times, is to exceed. He that compasses his design, never
loses his Reputation.] Art ought to supply strength. If we cannot proceed in
the King's highway of open force, we must take the bypath of Artifice. Wiles
are far more expeditious than strength. The wise have oftener got the better of
the brave, than the brave of the wise. When an enterprise fails, the door is
open to contempt.

MAXIM CCXXI.
Not to be too ready to engage, nor to engage another.
There are some men cut out for blundering, and making others stumble against
decency. They are always at the point of doing some foppery. They are very apt
to jostle rudely, but they unhappily break to pieces. They don't come off for
an hundred quarrels a day. Their humor being cross-grained, they contradict
all men in all things. Having their judgment set the wrong way, they disapprove
every thing. It belongs only to these great free-booters of prudence to do
nothing right, and to censure every thing as wrong. What Monsters are there in
the large Country of impertinence!

MAXIM CCXXII.
A reserved man is apparently a prudent man.
The Tongue is a wild Beast, very hard to be chained again, when once it is let
loose. It is the pulse, whereby the wise know the disposition of the Soul. By
that, intelligent men feel the motion of the heart. The mischief is, that he
who ought to be the most discreet, is the least. The wise man avoids fretting
and engaging, and thereby shows how much he is master of himself. He acts with
circumspection. He is a Janus in counterpoising, and an Argus in discerning.
Momus might have said with better reason, that the hands wanted eyes, than that
the heart needed a little window.

MAXIM CCXXIII.
Not to be too singular, neither through affectation, nor inadvertency.
Some make themselves remarkable by their singularity, that is to say, by
foolish actions, which are rather faults than differences: and as some are
known to all men, by some deformity in the face; so are these by I know not
what excess, that appears in their countenance. To be singular is good for
nothing, unless it be to make one pass for an original impertinent: which
alternately provokes the scorn of some, and the bad humor of others.

This Maxim being taken out of the Chapter of the Author's Discreet,
entitled, La Figureria, I have thought it pertinent to insert an extract of it
here as a Commentary.

There are, says he, many people, that serve as an object to be laughed at by
others, and those are purposely so, who to distinguish themselves from other
men, affect an extravagant singularity, which they observe in all their
actions. You shall see a man that would give any thing he could speak from his
poll, that he might not speak by the mouth, as others do. But since that is
impossible, they transform their voice, affect a little accent, invent idiomes,
and lisp it sweetingly, that they may be rare in every thing. They torture
their palate, in depriving it of all that naturally it loves. Seeing it is
common to them with the rest of Mankind and other Animals, they would change it
by an excess of singularity, which is rather the punishment of their
affectation, than the elevation of their grandeur. Sometimes they will be pleased
to drink dregs, and say it is Nectar. They leave the generous King of Liquours
for Waters, which are only precious in their fancies; they smell of Physic,
and they call them Ambrosia. Every day they invent Novelties, that they may
always improve in singularity; and the truth is, they succeed in it, since no
body else finds either the goodness or relish in the Ragoes, which they so
magnify. So that they remain all alone in their extravagancy, or as others call
it, impertinence. And some lives after. In Heroic actions, singularity is
becoming, and nothing gains more veneration to great employments. Grandeur
consists in the sublimity of wit, and in elevated thoughts. There is no
nobility like to that of the Heart. For it never stops to Artifice. Virtue is
the Character of Heroism. Difference is becoming there: Princes ought to live
with so great luster and splendor, by means of their good qualities, and
virtues, that, if the Stars descended from their Celestial Sphere, to come and
dwell with us, they should not be more luminous than they. There are others who
are not men; they affect to distinguish themselves by modes, and to singularize
themselves by an extraordinary air. They abhor all that is in practice. They
show an antipathy against custom. They affect Antiquity, and to revive old
fashions. Others in Spain wear the French habit, and in France the Spanish.
Nay, there are some that go into the Country with a Gorget, and to court with
a Band, playing so the Puppits, as if Derision needed a Ragoe. Men ought never
to give occasion of laughter to People of sense; nay, not so much as to
Children; and nevertheless there are a great many who seem to place their whole
study and care in making themselves ridiculous, and to be talked of by others.
They Would think the day ill spent, if they signalized it not by some ridiculous
singularity. But how could the mirth of some be entertained without the
extravagance of others? Some Vices serve as matter for others. And thus
Foppishness is the food of Calumny. But if frivolous singularity in the bark,
that is to say, in the outside, be a subject of laughter, what will the
internal, I mean, that of the mind be? There are some men, in whom, one would
say, that Nature had placed all things, Wit, Judgment and all, the wrong way.
They affect to appear so, for fear of conforming to Custom. Unintelligible in
their Reasoning, depraved in their Opinion, and irregular in all. For the
greatest singularity, without doubt, is that of the Understanding. Others
cloth their capriciousness with a vain Pride, lined with foppishness and
folly. With that they affect in all things and all places, a starched gravity.
They would seem to do honor with a look, and favor with a word of their
mouth.

MAXIM CCXXIV.
Never to take things against the hair, though they come that way.
Every thing has a right side and a wrong: The best thing hurts, if we take it
the wrong way. On the contrary the most unfitting fits, if it be taken by the
handle. Many things have given trouble that would have been pleasant, if one
had known the good of them. In all things there is good and bad. The skill lies
in knowing how to find out the good. One and the same thing, has its good day,
and its bad. Examine it on the fairest side. We must not give the contrary
reins to good and evil. Hence it is that some take pleasure in all things, and
others in nothing. A good expedient against the reverse of fortune, and for
living in any time, and in any employment that happens to men.

MAXIM CCXXV.
To know ones prevailing fault.
Every one has one, that makes a counterpoise to his predominant perfection.
And if it be backed by inclination, it rules like a Tyrant. Let one begin to to
make War against it then, by declaring it: and let that be by a manifesto. For
if it be known, it will be overcome; and especially if he that has it, judge
it to be as great, as it appears to others. To be master of ones self, there is
need of reflecting upon ones self. If once that root of imperfections be plucked
out, we'll soon be able to master the rest.

MAXIM CCXXVI.
Attention to engage.
Most part of men neither speak nor act according to what themselves are, but
according to the impression of others. There is no body, but is more than
sufficient for persuading evil, because evil is most easily believed, even
sometimes when it is incredible. The best thing we can pretend to, depends on
the fancy of others. Some are satisfied to have reason on their side: but that
is not enough, and by consequent, it needs to be pursued. Sometime the care of
engaging costs but very little, and is worth a great deal. With words we
purchase good deeds. In this great Inn of the World, there is no utencil so
small, but that it may happen to be useful once in a year: and, for all it is
of so little worth, it will be very inconvenient to be without it. Every one
speaks of the object according to his passion.

MAXIM CCXXVII.
Not to be a man of the first impression.
Some espouse the first information, so that all others are but Concubines. And
as falsehood goes always first, so truth finds no place after. Neither the mind,
nor the will, ought ever to be filled neither with the first proposition, nor
the first object: which is the sign of a poor stock. Some resemble a new pot
that retains always the smell of the first liquour good or bad, that has been
put into it. When that weakness comes to be known it is pernicious, because it
gives advantage to the artifices of malice. They who have bad intentions,
hasten to give their tincture to credulity. A void space must be left then for
revision. Let Alexander keep the other ear for the adverse party. Let a door be
open for a second and third information. It Is a sign of incapacity to stick to
the first, nay, and a fault that borders upon head-strongness.

MAXIM CCXXVIII.
To have neither the report, nor reputation of being a bad Tongue.
For that is to be reckoned a general scourge. Be not ingenious at the cost of
another: which is more odious than painful. All men revenge themselves of an
evil Speaker, by speaking evil of him: and seeing he is alone, he will be sooner
overcome than the others, who are numerous, can be convicted. Evil ought never
to be the subject of contentment nor commentary. A detractor is eternally
hated, and if sometimes great men converse with him, it is more out os pleasure
to hear his Satyrs, than for any esteem they have of him. He that speaks ill,
causes always more to be said of himself.

MAXIM CCXXIX.
To know how to divide ones life, like a man of Parts.
Not according as occasions present, but by foresight and choice. A life that
has no intermission, is painful, like a long way, where there is no Inn.
Variety well understood makes it happy. The first period ought to be spent in
speaking with the dead. We are born to know, and to know our selves: and it is
by Books that we truly learn that, and become complete men. The second station
is to be allotted for the living, that is to say, that we ought to see what is
best in the World, and keep a register of it. [All is not to be found in one
place. The universal Father has distributed his gifts, and sometimes it has
pleased him to give a largess to the most miserable Country. The third pause
ought to be all for our selves.] The chief happiness is to Philosophize.

This Maxim is taken out of the last Chapter of his Discreet, an abstract
whereof it is fit to subjoin as a Commentary to it.

The Wise Man, says he, measures his life, as one that has little and much to
live. A life without rests is a long way without Inns. Nature has proportioned
the life of man according to the course of the Sun; and the four ages of life
according to the four seasons of the year. The Spring of man begins in his
Infancy. The flowers of it are tender, and the hopes frail. It is followed by
the hot and excessive Summer of Youth, every way dangerous, because of the
boiling blood, and the frequent eruptions of passions. The Autumn of Manly Age
comes next, crowned with the ripe fruits of mind and will: and then at length
the Winter of old Age, wherein the leaves of vigor fall; when the rivulets of
the veins freeze; Snow covers the Head, when the Hair and Teeth are gone; and
when life trembles at the approaches of death. And a page after. It was a piece
of celebrated wit in that gallant Person, who divided the Comedy into three
days, and the voyage of life into three stations. The first he employed in
speaking with the dead; the second in conversing with the living; and the third
in entertaining ones self. Let us explain the riddle. I say, he gave the first
term of life to Books. He read them, and that was rather a pleasure than a
toil. For if one be the more a man, the more he knows, the noblest employment
will be to learn. He devoured Books, which are the food of the Soul, and the
delights of the mind. It Is great happiness to meet with the best on every
subject. He learned the two universal Languages, Latin and Spanish, which are
now adays the Keys of the World; and the five particular, to wit, the Greek,
the Italian, the French, the English, and the Dutch; that he might make his
profit of all the good that is celebrated in them. After that, he bequeathed
himself to that Grandmother of life, the Wife of the Mind, and the Daughter of
Experience, plausible History, I mean that which delights and instructs most.
He began with the Ancients, and ended with the Modern, though others take the
contrary course, choosing his Authors, and distinguishing the Times, the Dates,
Centuries, and Ages; searching into the causes of the growth, fall, and
revolution of Monarchies, and Re-publicks; the number, order, and qualities of
their Princes, their Actions in Peace and War. He walked in the delicious
Gardens of Poetry, not so much to exercise himself as to play there. Yet he was
not so ignorant, but that he knew how to make a verse; nor so unadvised, as to
make two. Amongst all the Poets he gave his heart to sententious Horace, and
his hand to subtle Martial: which was to give him the Laurel. To Poesy he
joined savoury Humanity. Then he proceeded to Philosophy, and beginning with
Natural, he acquired the structure of the Universe, of the mavelous being of
Man, of the properties of Animals, and Plants, and in fine, of the qualities of
precious Stones. But he took more pleasure in Moral Philosophy, which is the
food of real men, as that which gives life to Prudence: and he studied it in
the Books of the Wise and Philosophers, who have compiled it to us in
Sentences, Apophthegms, Emblems and Apologues. He knew both Cosmographies, the
material and formal, measuring the Earth and the Sea; distinguishing the
Elevations and Climates, the four parts of the world, and in them, Provinces
and Nations: that he might not be one of those Ignorants and half Beasts, who
have never known what it is they tread upon. Of Astrology he knew as much as
Wisdom suffers to be known, etc. In fine, he crowned his Studies by a long and
serious application to the reading of Holy Scriptures, which is the most
useful, universal and pleasant study for men of judgment. So that Moral
Philosophy rendered him Prudent; Natural, Knowing; History, Discreet; Poetry,
Ingenious; Rhetoric, Eloquent; Humanity, Polite; Cosmography, Intelligent; and
the study of Holy Scripture, Pious and Devote.

He employed the second part of his life in Traveling, which is the second
happiness of a man that is curious, and capable of making good use of it. He
sought and found all that was best in the world. For when we see not things, we
enjoy them not fully. There is a great deal to be said betwixt what one
imagines, and what he sees. He takes more pleasure in objects who sees them but
once, than he that sees them often. The first time one is contented, at all
others he is tired. The first day, a pretty thing is the pleasure of him who is
the master of it; but after that, it affects him no more than that of a
stranger. He saw the Courts of greatest Princes, and by consequent the
Prodigies of Nature and Art in Picture, Sculpture, Tapestry, Jewels, etc. He
conversed with the excellentest men of the World, either in learning, or any
thing else, whereby he had the means of observing, censuring, confronting, and
putting the just value upon all things.

He spent the third part of so fine a life in meditating upon the much which he
had read; and the more which he had seen. All that enters by the door of the
senses into this Haven of the Soul, is unloaded at the Custom-house of the
mind, where every thing is Registered. There it is that things are weighed,
judged, examined, and the quintessences of truths drawn. Ripe age is designed
for contemplation. For the more strength the Body loses, the more the Soul
acquires. The balance of the superior part rises as much, as that of the
inferior falls. At that time men judge of things in a far different manner.
Maturity of age seasons Reason, and tempers the Passions. From seeing, one
becomes intelligent; from contemplating wise. The Crown of a Prudent Man is to
be a Philosopher, by drawing from all things, in imitation of the laborious
Be, either the honey of pleasant profit, or the wax that may serve to make a
Torch to undeceive him. Philosophy is nothing else but a meditation on death.
It is good to think on it many times before, that one may succeed in it at the
last.

MAXIM CCXXX.
To open ones Eyes when it is time.
All who see, have not their Eyes open; nor do all that look see. To reflect
too late, is not a remedy, but a vexation. Some begin to see when there is no
more to be seen. They have undone their houses, and squandered away their
fortunes, before they made any thing of themselves. It Is hard to give
understanding to him that has no mind to have it; and harder still to give the
will to him that has no understanding. They who are about them, play with them,
as with blind men, and they are a diversion for all the company. And seeing
they are deaf to hear, they never open their Eyes to see. Nevertheless there
are some who foment that insensibility, because their well-being consists in
procuring others to be nothing. Unhappy the Horse, whose Master has no Eyes! He
will hardly ever be fat.

MAXIM CCXXXI.
Never to show things before they be finished.
All beginnings are defective, and the imagination is always prejudiced. The
remembering to have seen a thing imperfect, takes from one the liberty of
thinking it pretty when it is finished. To have a full view at once of a great
object, is a hindrance to judge of every part of it; but it is also a pleasure
that fills the whole imagination. A thing is nothing, till it be all: and when
a thing begins to be, it is farther from being any thing. To see the most
exquisite Dishes dressed, provokes more disgust than Appetite. Let every skillful
Master then, have a care not to let his works be seen in embrio. Let him learn
of Nature not to expose them, till they be in a condition of appearing.

MAXIM CCXXXII.
To understand the Commerce of life a little.
All must not be Theory, let there be some Practice also. The wisest are easily
deceived. For though they understand the extraordinary, yet they are ignorant
of the ordinary way of living; which is the most necessary. The contemplation
of high things, suffers them not to think of those which are common: and seeing
they are ignorant of what they ought first to know, that is to say, of what
every one does, they are looked upon with wonder, or esteemed ignorant by the
vulgar, who consider only the surface. Let a wise man then take care to know
as much of the Commerce of life, as may serve to keep him from being the fop,
or laughing stock of others. Let him be a man of management. For though that be
not the highest point of life, it is nevertheless the most useful. What is
knowledge good for, if it be not put into practice? To know how to live, is now
a days the true knowledge.

MAXIM CCXXXIII.
To find out the palate of others.
Else you will displease, instead of pleasing. Some for want of understanding the
tempers of people, vex when they thought to oblige. There are actions that are
flattery for some, and an offense for others: and many times that which was
believed to be a good Office, has proved a disservice. It has sometimes cost
more to do a displeasure, than to do a pleasure. How can we please other men,
if we know not their humor? Hence it is that some have censured, thinking they
praised: a punishment which they well deserved. Others think to divert by their
Eloquence, and cloy the mindby their babbling.

MAXIM CCXXXIV.
Never to engage ones Reputation without good assurances of the honor and
integrity of others.
To follow the way of silence, is the way to profit: but to lose, facility will
do the work. As to the concerns of Honor, it is good always to make one in
company: so that ones own Reputation be obliged to take care of the Reputation
of another. One must never be surety: but if that sometimes happen, let it be
done so discreetly, that Prudence may yield to Circumspection. Let the risque
be common, and the Cause reciprocal, to the end that he who is the Accomplice,
may not set up for an Evidence.

MAXIM CCXXXV.
To know how to ask.
There is nothing easier for some, nor more difficult for others. Some there
are, who cannot refuse, and by consequent there is no need of a hook to draw
from them what one would have. There are others again, whose first word is
always no: with those there is need of cunning. But of whomsoever we have any
thing to ask, we ought to nick our time; as, for instance, at the conclusion of
a good Meal, or of some other refreshment, that has put them in a good humor:
in case the Prudence of him that is addressed to, prevent not the Artifice of
him who desires. Days of rejoicing are the days of favor, because the joy
within spreads it self abroad. We are not to present our selves, when we see
another denied, seeing then the fear of saying no, is surmounted. When there is
melancholy within doors, nothing is to be done. To oblige before hand, is a
bill of Exchange, when the Correspondent is a civil man.

MAXIM CCXXXVI.
To make that a favor, which would have been afterward but a reward.
That Is the art of greatest Politicians. Favors, which go before Merits, are
the touchstone of Gentlemen. An anticipated favor has two perfections: one
is, the promptitude, which obliges the receiver to greater gratitude: and the
other, because the same gift, which coming later would be a debt, by
anticipation is a pure favor. A cunning way of transforming obligations, since
he, who would have deserved to be rewarded, is obliged to a thankful
acknowledgment. I speak of men of honor. For, as to others, it would rather be
a curb than a spur, to give them an honourary before hand.

MAXIM CCXXXVII.
Never to be privy to the secrets of Superiors.
You may think to share in the Plums, but it is only in the Stones. To have
been confidents, has been the undoing of many. It is with confidents, as with
the crust of bread, that is used instead of a spoon, which runs the risque of
being swallowed down with the broth. Confidence is not the favor, but the
impost of the Prince. Many break their Looking-glass, because it shows them
their ugliness. A Prince cannot abide to see the man, who may have seen him:
and the witness of an ill act, is always ill looked upon. One ought never to be
too much obliged to any body, and far less to great men. Services rendered,
stand better with them than favors received. But above all things, the
confidences of Friendship are dangerous. He that has entrusted his secret to
another, has made himself his slave: and in Sovereigns, it is a violence that
cannot last long. For they are impatient to redeem their lost liberty: and for
succeeding in that, they will overturn every thing, nay, and reason it self. It Is
a Maxim for secrets, Neither to hear them, nor tell them.

MAXIM CCXXXVIII.
To know the piece that we want.
Several men would be great, if they wanted not a somewhat, without which they
never attain to the height of perfection. It Is to be observed in some, that
they might be worth much, if they would supply a little defect. To some,
seriousness is wanting, for fault of which great qualities have no luster in
them. To others, sweetness of carriage: a defect, which those that frequent
their company, soon discover, and especially in dignified persons. In some more
briskness is desired; and in others more reservedness. It were easy to supply
all these defects, if one minded them. For reflection may turn Custom into a
second Nature.

MAXIM CCXXXIX.
Not to be too-quaint.
It Is better to be reserved. To know more than is needful, is to blunt the
edge of wit, seeing subtilties, commonly, are easily cracked. Truth well
authorized is surer. It is good to have understanding, but not a flux at the
mouth. Too much reasoning looks like jangling. A solid judgment that reasons no
more than what is fit, is much better.

MAXIM CCXL.
To know how to play the Ignorant.
The ablest man sometimes acts this part: and there are occasions, when the
best knowledge is to pretend not to know. One must not be ignorant, but only
pretend to be so. It signifies little to be knowing with Fops, and Prudent with
Fools. We are to speak to every man according to his Character. He is not the
ignorant who pretends to be such, but he that is caught by such. Not he that
counterfeits, but he that really is so. The only way to be beloved, is to put
on the skin of the silliest of Animals.

MAXIM CCXLI.
To suffer raissery, but not to use it.
The one is a kind of Gallantry; the other a sort of Engagement. He that is off
of the hinges when people are rejoicing, has much, and shows still more of the
nature of a Beast. Jocoseness is diverting. He that can suffer it, passes for a
man of great stock: whereas he that is netled at it, provokes others to nettle
him the more. The best way is to let it pass without making too much on it. The
greatest truths have always come from raillery. There is nothing that demands
more circumspection nor skill. Before one begin, he ought to know the reach of
him, with whom he intends to make himself merry.

MAXIM CCXLII.
To pursue ones point.
There are some only good for beginning, who never bring any thing to an end.
They invent, but they prosecute not, so inconstant is their mind. They never
acquire Reputation, because they never proceed to a period. These always end by
stopping short. In others, that comes from impatience, and it is the fault of
the Spaniards, as patience is the virtue of the Flemings. These see the end of
affairs, and affairs see the end of those. They sweat till they have overcome
the difficulty, and then rest content that they have weathered it. They know
not how to make the best of their victory. They show that they can, but that
they will not. But after all, it is still a fault either of inability, or
levity. If the design be good, why should it not be accomplished? if it be bad,
why begun? let a man of parts then, kill his game, and let him not stop at
starting of it.

MAXIM CCXLIII.
Not to be a Dove in all things.
Let the cunning of the Serpent go in course with the simplicity of the Dove.
There is nothing easier than to deceive a good man. He that neverlies, easily
believes; and he that never deceives, confides much. To be deceived is not
always a sign of brutishness: For goodness is sometimes the cause of it. There
are two sorts of people that well knew how to prevent a mischief, the one,
because they have learnt what it is at their own cost; and the others, because
they have learnt it at the expense of others. Prudence ought then to be as
careful to caution it self, as cunning is to cheat. Have a care not to be so
good a man, that others may take occasion from it of being bad. Be a
composition of the Dove and Serpent; not a Monster, but a Prodigy.

MAXIM CCXLIV.
To know how to oblige.
Some so well metamorphose favors, that it seems they do them, even when they
receive them. There are men of such parts, that they oblige by asking, because
they transform their own interest into another honor.) They so adjust
matters, that one would say, others discharged their duty, when they grant them
what they ask, so dextrous they are in inverting the order of obligations by a
singular knack of Policy. At least they make it doubtful who it is that
obliges. They buy the best thing with praises: and when they insinuate a desire
to have it, it is thought an honor to bestow it. For they engage Civility by
making that a debt, which ought to be the cause of their thankfulness. Thus
they change the obligation from passive to active, being better Politicians
than Grammarians. That, in reality, is a great dexterity: but it would be a
greater still to see into it, and to baulk such a foolish bargain, by giving
them back their Civilities, and every one re-taking his own.

MAXIM CCXLV.
To reason sometimes quite contrary to the mobile.
That shows a high mind. A great Genius ought not to esteem those who never
contradict him. For that is no mark of their affection to him, but of their love
to themselves. Let him have a care of being the fop to flattery by answering it
any otherwise, than with the contempt which it deserves. Let him even take it
for an honor to be censured by some people, and particularly by those, who
speak ill of all good men. Let it vex him, if his actions please all sorts of
men, seeing that is a sign that they are not such as they ought to be: what is
perfect being observed but of a very few.

MAXIM CCXLVI.
Never to give satisfaction to those who demand none.
To give even too much to those who demand it, is a blameable action. To make
an excuse before it be time, is to accuse ones self. To be let blood, when one
is in health, is a signal for a sickness to come. An anticipated excuse awakens
a discontent that slept. A Prudent Man ought not to seem sensible of another's
suspicion, because that is to court his resentment. He ought only endeavor to
cure that suspicion by a sincere and civil deportment.

MAXIM CCXLVII.
To know a little more, and to live a little less.
Others on the contrary say, that honest leisure is better than much business.
Nothing is ours, but time, which even they, who have no fixed habitation enjoy.
It is an equal misfortune to employ the precious time of life in mechanical
exercises, or in the hurry of great affairs. One is not to load himself neither
with business, nor envy. That Is to live, and yet be choked in a Crowd. Some
extend this precept even to Sciences. But not to know, is not to live. See
Maxim 4.

MAXIM CCXLVIII.
Not to put off to the last.
There are men of a last impression, (for impertinence runs always upon
extremes.) They have a mind and a will of wax. The last applies the Seal, and
effaces all the others. These men are never gained, because with the same
facility they are lost. Every body gives them a tincture. They are the worst
confidents in the world. They are Children as long as they live: and as such,
they only flote in the ebb and flood of their opinions and passions, always
lame both in will and judgment, because they toss themselves now to one side,
and by and by again to the other.

MAXIM CCXLIX.
Not to begin to live, where we should leave off.
Some take their ease in the beginning, and leave the pains to the latter end.
What is substantial ought to go first, and the accessory after, if there be
place for that. Others would triumph, before they fight. Some again begin their
knowledge by what least concerns them, delaying the study of things that might
prove useful and honorable unto them, till life is like to fail. Hardly has
such a man begun to make his fortune, but he is gone, or going. The method is
equally necessary both for knowing and living.

MAXIM CCL.
When must one reason the contrary way.
When men speak to us with a design to surprise us. With some people every
thing ought to be taken in a contrary sense. The yea is the no, and the no the
yea. To undervalue a thing is a sign one esteems it: seeing he that would have
it for himself, depretiates it to others. To praise is not always to speak
good: for some, that they may not praise the good, affect to commend the bad.
He that thinks no body bad, will think no man good.

MAXIM CCLI.
We are to use Humane means, as if there were none Divine; and Divine means, as
if there were none Humane.
It is the precept of a great Master, and needs no Commentary.

MAXIM CCLII.
Not altogether for thy self, nor altogether for others neither.
Both the one and the other is an insupportable Tyranny. To be altogether for
ones self, infers necessarily, that one would have all to himself. These men
cannot part with an ace of any thing that is convenient for them. They oblige
little, they trust to their Fortune, but commonly that support fails them. It
is good sometimes to forsake our selves for the sake of others, to the end
others may do so for us. Whoever is in public place, is by duty a public
Servant. Otherwise it will be said to him, what the old Woman said once to
Adrian the Emperor: Renounce then thy place, as thou do thy duty. On the
contrary, others are altogether for others. For folly runs always to excess,
and is very unlucky in that particular. They have not a day, nor so much as an
hour for themselves, and they are so little their own men, that there was one
who was called Every bodies man. They are not themselves even in the
understanding. For they know for all, and are ignorant for themselves. Let a
man of sense consider, that it is not he who is courted, but an interest that
is in him, or depends upon him.

MAXIM CCLIII.
Not to be too intelligible.
Most part do not esteem what they conceive, but admire what they understand
not. Things must cost somewhat, that they may be valued. One will pass for an
able man, when he is not understood. He is to appear always more prudent, and
intelligent than is needful, with him to whom he speaks; but with proportion
rather than excess. And though good sense be of great weight amongst knowing
men, yet sublimity is necessary to please the most part. We must take from them
the means of censuring, by busying their minds in conceiving. Many praise that
which they can give no reason for, when it is asked them: because they
reverence as a mystery all that is hard to be comprehended, and extol it, by
reason they hear it extolled.

MAXIM CCLIV.
Not to slight the evil, because it is little.
For an evil never comes all alone. Evils, as well as blessings hang together
as by links. Happiness and misery attend those commonly who have most of
either: and thence it is, that all avoid the unhappy, and court the fortunate.
Doves themselves, for all their simplicity, rest on the fairest Pidgeon House.
Every thing goes wrong with the unfortunate man, he is wanting to himself, in
losing the favorable gale. Misfortune, when asleep, is not to be awakened. A
slippery step is no great matter, and yet it has occasioned a fatal fall, from
which one could not tell how to recover. For as no good is perfect, so is there
no evil neither at its highest pitch. That which proceeds from Heaven above,
requires patience; and that which arises from the world below, Prudence.

MAXIM CCLV.
To do small kindnesses at a time, but often.
Engagement should never exceed Ability. Whoever gives much, does not give but
sell. Gratitude is not to be overloaded* For he that finds himself in an
impossibility to make satisfaction, will break off the Correspondence. The way
to lose many Friends, is excessively to oblige them. Being unable to re-pay,
they withdraw, and from being obliged, turn Enemies. A statue would be willing
never to see its maker, nor the obliged his benefactour. The best method in
giving, is to order things so, that it cost but little, and that that little be
earnestly desired, to the end it may be the more esteemed.

MAXIM CCLVI.
To be always in a readiness to ward the blows of Clowns, Opiniatours, proud
Persons, and of all other Impertinents.
There are a great many such to be met with, and it is Prudence never to come
to a brush with them: Let a wise man daily look in the glass of reflection, that
he may see the need he has of arming himself with resolution, and by that
means he will disappoint all the jirks of folly. If he think seriously on that,
he will never expose himself to the ordinary risques that men run into, by
engaging with Fools. A man armed with Prudence, will never be baffled by
impertinence. The Navigation of civil life is dangerous, because it is full of
Rocks, on which Reputation splits. The surest way is to turn aside, taking
lessons of cunning from Ulysses. Here an artificious defeat does great service.
But above all, save thy self by thy wit. For that is the shortest way of making
the best of a bad bargain.

MAXIM CCLVII.
Never to come to a Rupture.
For Reputation by so doing comes always off shattered. Any man is sufficient
to be an Enemy, but not a Friend. Few are in a condition of doing good, but all
almost can do mischief. The Eagle is not secure in the arms of Jupiter
himself, if it offend the Beetle. Secret Enemies that lie upon the watch, blow
the fire, when they see the War declared. Friends that quarrel, become the
worst Enemies. They reckon their own choice amongst other men's faults.
Spectatours of the rupture speak severally of it, as they think, and think what
they desire. They condemn both parties either for want of foresight in the
beginning, or of patience in the end, but always of Prudence. If the rupture be
inevitable, it ought at least to be excusable. An indifference would do better
than a violent declaration. On this occasion, a handsome retreat is honorable.

MAXIM CCLVIII.
To look out for one that may help to carry the burden of adversity.
Be never alone, especially in dangers. Else thou will charge thy self with all
the hatred. Some think to raise themselves by taking upon them the whole
oversight of businesses, and they attract to themselves all the envy: whereas
with a companion one secures himself against the evil, or at least bears but
part of it. Neither fortune nor the whimsey of the people can play so easily
upon two. The skillful Physician, who has not succeeded in the cure of his
Patient, never fails to take the assistence of another, who under the name of
consultation, helps him to bear up the Pall. Divide then the office and trouble
of it: for it is intolerable to suffer alone.

MAXIM CCLIX.
To prevent offenses, and turn them into favors.
There is more dexterity in shunning, than in revenging them. It is great
address to make a confident of him, who might have been an Adversary; and to
transform those into butteresses of Reputation, who threatened to ruin the
same. It is of great use to know how to oblige. To prevent an injury by a
favor, is to intercept its course: and it is great skill in living, to change
that which was like to cause nothing but discontent into pleasure. Place then
thy confidence in malevolence it self.

MAXIM CCLX.
Thou shall never be wholly at the devotion of any one, nor any one at thine.
Neither is blood, friendship, nor the strictest obligation sufficient for
that. For it must be another-guess interest that can oblige one to abandon his
heart and will. The greatest union admits of exception, and without prejudice
too to the laws of most intimate Friendship. The Friend always reserves some
secret, and the Son conceals somewhat even from the Father. Some things are
made mysteries to some, and yet communicated to others; and contrariwise: so
that a man resigns or refuses himself wholly, according to the distinction he
makes of those of his Correspondence.

MAXIM CCLXI.
Not to continue a Foppery.
Some make an engagement of their mistakes: when they have once begun to fail,
they think they are concerned in honor to continue. Their heart accuses their
fault, and their mouth defends it. Whence it happens, that if they have been
taxed for inadvertency, when they began the foppery, they pass for fools, when
they continue it. An imprudent proneness, and a rash resolution, impose no
obligation. Thus, some continue their first foolery, and make their silliness
the more remarkable, by a vanity in appearing constant impertinents. See the
Maxim 214.

MAXIM CCLXII.
To know how to forget.
That Is a happiness rather than an art. Those things are best remembered which
ought most to be forgotten. The memory has not only the incivility to fail
one in time of need, but also the impertinence, to be unseasonably officious.
In all that is like to be troublesome, it is prodigal; and barren in every thing
that might give pleasure. Sometimes the remedy of the evil consists in
forgetting it, and we forget the remedy. Memory then must be accustomed to take
another course, because it is it that can give us either a Paradise or a Hell.
I except those who live contentedly. For in their state of Innocence they enjoy
the felicity of Idiots.

MAXIM CCLXIII.
Many things that serve for pleasure, ought not to be peculiar.
One enjoys more of what is another's, than of what belongs to himself. The
first day is for the Master, and all the rest for Strangers. One doubly enjoys
what belongs to others, that is to say, not only without fear of loss, but also
with the pleasure of Novelty. Privation makes every thing better. The water of
another man's Well is as delicious as Nectar. Besides that possession lessens
the pleasure of enjoyment, it augments the trouble, whether in lending, or in
not lending. It serves only to preserve things for another: and over and
above, the number of the discontented is always greater, than of the thankful.

MAXIM CCLXIV.
To be at no time careless.
Lot takes pleasure in surprise. It will let slip a thousand occasions to take
its men one day napping. Wit, Prudence and Courage ought to be upon the guard,
and in like manner beauty, inasmuch as the day of its confidence, will be that
of the loss of its credit. The Who thought on it is the trip that turns up the
heels. Besides, it is an ordinary trick of others malice to lay a snare for
good qualities, that they may be more rigorously sifted. The days of
ostentation are well known, and cunning pretends not to mind it: but it chooses
the day when one least expects, to make a trial of what one is able to do.

MAXIM CCLXV.
To know how to engage ones Dependents.
A pat engagement has put a great many men in credit, just as a ship wreck
makes good swimmers. By that, many have displayed their industry and ability,
which would have lain buried in their retirement, if occasion had not
presented. Difficulties and dangers are the causes and spurs of Reputation. A
great courage, in the occasions of honor, does as much service as a thousand
others. Queen Isabelle of Castile, knew eminently that lesson of engaging, as
well as all others: and the great Captain Gonsalvo owed all his Reputation to
that politic Address, which was the cause also, that many others became great
men.

MAXIM CCLXVI.
To be too good, is to be naught.
He is so, who is never angry. Insensible men are scarcely men. That quality
proceeds not always from indolency, but often from incapacity. To resent when
it is proper, is the action of a complete man. Birds at first sight scorn your
carved figures. To mingle the sharp with the sweet, is the sign of a good
relish. Sweetness alone is only for Children and Idiots. It Is a great
misfortune to fall into that insensibility, by being too good natured.

That man, says he, in the seventh Critic of the third part of his Criticon,
is one of those who are called insensible; of those people, whom nothing can
alter, and who are not concerned at any thing; not so much as at the greatest
reverse of fortune, nor the imperfection of their own nature, nor yet the
home-thrusts of malice. The whole world may conspire against them, it is all one
to them; it will neither spoil their Appetite, nor break their sleep. And that
they call indolence, nay, great courage too.

MAXIM CCLXVII.
Silken words.
Arrows pierce the body, and bad words the soul. A good humor makes a good
tongue. It Is a great art in life to know how to sell air. Words answer almost
every thing, and nothing is impossible for them. Men negotiate in the air, and
with the air: and a strong breath lasts long. The mouth must always be full of
sugar to sweeten the words. For Enemies themselves can then relish them. The
only way to be amiable is to be affable. See the end of the Commentary of the
Maxim 14.

MAXIM CCLXVIII.
The Wise Man ought to do in the beginning, what the Fool does in the end.
Both do the same thing: the difference is that the one does it in season, and
the other out of season. He, who in the beginning has his mind wrong set,
continues to be so in all the rest. He draws with his foot what he should carry
on his head; he makes his right hand his left: so that he is left handed in all
his Conduct. After all, it always happens, that they do by force what they
might have done of their own accord: whereas the wise man sees what is to be
done timely and at leisure, and puts it in execution with pleasure and
Reputation.

MAXIM CCLXIX.
To make the best of ones being new.
So long as it lasts, one will be esteemed. It generally takes because of
variety, which pleases the palate. An ordinary thing, but spick and span new,
is more valued, than a rarity that is seen often. Excellences wear out and soon
grow old. That glory of Novelty will not last long, it is but a nine days
wonder. Make use then of the first fruits of Esteem, by gaining speedily all
that thou can pretend to from a transient complaisance. For if once the
fresh gloss be gone, the passion will cool, and that which pleased as being
new, will cloy as being common. Every thing has had its time, and then been
slighted.

MAXIM CCLXX.
Not to condemn singly what pleases many.
For there must be some good in it, when so many are content with it: and
though it be not told what it is, yet it is known and enjoyed. Singularity is
always odious, and when ill grounded, ridiculous. It disgraces rather the
person than the object. So that one will be left alone with his whimsical
palate. Let him that is not able to discern the good conceal the weakness of
his judgment, and not meddle in condemning at random. For a bad discerning
springs from ignorance. What all men say, is, or would be so.

MAXIM CCLXXI.
Let him that knows but little in his profession, stick to what he knows best.
For if he be not reckoned quaint, at least he will be reckoned solid. He that
knows, may engage, and do at his pleasure: but to know little, and to run a
risque, is a voluntary precipice. Hold always to the surer side. What is
authorized cannot fail. For a weak knowledge a beaten path: and besides,
security is better than singularity, not only for the knowing, but also for
the ignorant.

MAXIM CCLXXII.
To sell things as Courtesy thinks fit to value them.
That Is the way to oblige the more. The selfish demand of the interested man
will never equal the good grace of a generous obliged heart in giving.
Courtesy does not give, but engage; and the gallant way of it renders the
obligation the greater. Nothing costs an honest man dearer, than what is
frankly given him. It is to sell it to him twice, and at two different rates,
the one at the worth of the thing, and the other at the value of the
Generosity. It Is true, however, that Gallantry is not a Commodity for the use
of sneaking beggarly fellows, because they know not what it is to live like men.

MAXIM CCLXXIII.
Thoroughly to know the temper of those with whom we have to do.
The effect is soon known, when once the cause is known. It is known first in
it self, and then its motive. The melancholy person always, presages
misfortunes, and the back-biter faults. The worst runs always in their heads;
and as they see not the present good, so they denounce future evils that may or
may not happen. A man prepossessed with passion, speaks always in a style
different to what things are. Passion and not reason speaks in him; every one
judges according to his caprice or humor, and no body according to truth.
Learn then to unmask a counterfeit show, and to spell out the characters of the
heart. Study with thy self to know him that always laughs without reason; and
him that never laughs but when he should. Distrust an asker of many questions
as an impertinent, or a spy. Seldom expect good from those who have any natural
deformity in body. For it is usual with them to be revenged of Nature in doing
her as little honor as she has done to them. Commonly silliness bears
proportion to beauty.

MAXIM CCLXXIV.
To have the gift of pleasing.
Civility is a strong political magic. It is a gentile hook, to be used rather
for attracting hearts, than drawing in of profit; or rather, indeed, for all
things. Merit will not do the work, if it be not seconded by agreeableness, on
which depends all the plausibility of actions. This agreeableness is the most
efficacious instrument of Sovereignty. There is a luck in it to put others into
appetite: yet Artifice contributes to that also. In all things where there is
much of Nature, Art always succeeds best. From thence springs that
unaccountable somewhat, which gains universal favor.

MAXIM CCLXXV.
To conform to common Custom, but not to common Folly.
Be not always starched in thy gravity, it is part of Gallantry to dispense with
a little decorum for gaining the common good will. Sometimes we may do as
others have done, and still without indecency. He that is taken for a fool in
public, will never be reckoned a Wise Man in private. There is more lost in
one day of liberty, than gained by a long course of seriousness. But one must
not always be for exception neither. To be singular is to condemn others. And
it is worse still to affect sanctified looks. That Is to be left to the Women.
Nay, sometimes your Godly render themselves ridiculous. It is the best of a man
to appear like a man. A Woman may with gracefullness affect a manly air, but a
Man cannot without disparagement take upon him that of a Woman.

MAXIM CCLXXVI.
To be able to retrieve ones Genius by Nature and by Art.
Man, they say, changes his temper once in seven years. In a good time, if it
be for the better. In the first seven years reason comes to him. Let him so
order things, that at every change he may acquire some new perfection. He ought
to observe that natural revolution, that he may second it, and advance still
farther and farther in the sequel. Thus many have changed their Conduct, as
well in their condition, as employment. And sometimes it is not perceived, till
the greatness of the alteration be observed. At twenty years of age a Peacock;
at thirty a Lion; at forty a Camel; at fifty a Serpent; at sixty a Dog; at
seventy an Ape; at fourscore nothing at all.

This Allegory is explained in the discourse 56 of the Author's Agudeza, in
these terms.

Man, because of the dignity of his Nature, thinking that he ought to be
immortal, ask't Jupiter, how long he was to live, Jupiter made answer, That
when he resolved to create all Animals, and then man, he had proposed to allow
every one of them thirty years of life. Man was surprised to hear that so
wonderful a piece of Workmanship, as he was, had been made to last so short a
time, and that his life must pass like a slower. He thought it strange, that
being scarcely come out of his Mother's Womb, he was to enter into that of the
Earth, without enjoying the pleasant state, wherein he was created. I beseech
thee then, said he, O Jupiter, (if it be so that my desire be not contrary to
thy Decrees) that since all the Animals unworthy of thy favors, have refused
twenty years of the term of life, which thou have given them, being ignorant of
the good thou did them, as being destitute of reason: it would please thee to
grant them to me, that I may live them in their stead, and that thou may be
better served by me. Jupiter finding the desire reasonable, allowed it: so that
having lived his own thirty years, he should begin to live, first, the twenty
years, that the Ass yielded, on condition that he should perform all its
duties, in laboring, carting, drawing, and carrying to the House all that was
necessary for Husbandry. That from fifty to seventy years of age he should live
the twenty years of the Dog, barking, and growling, as having many troubles,
and no pleasure in any thing. And that at length from seventy to ninety he
should accomplish the years of the Ape, in imitating the defects of Nature. So
we see that they who come to that age, are accustomed, as old as they are, to
affect to seem young, to dress and spruce up themselves, and to use the
exercises of Youth, that they may seem to be what they are not; as also to play
with Children, as Apes do.

He says the very same thing almost in the last Chapter of his Discreet. Thirty
years, says he, were given to man for enjoyment and rejoicing; twenty were lent
him upon his word, for laboring; twenty more of the Dog for barking; and the
last twenty to play and fool with little Children, like Apes.

MAXIM CCLXXVII.
The man of true Ostentation.
That Talent gives luster to all others, every thing has its time, and that
time is to be watched. For every day is not a day of triumph. There are some
men of a particular Character, in whom little appears to be much, and the much
makes them admired. When excellence concurs with stallage, it passes for a
Prodigy. There are ostentative Nations, and the Spanish with the first. The
show stands in stead of much, and particularly, if reality vouch for it.
Heaven, which gives perfection, bespeaks ostentation; for without it all
perfection would be under constraint. Art must go along with Ostentation. The
excellentest things depend on circumstances, and by consequent are not always
in season. Whenever Ostentation comes unseasonably, it succeeds ill. Nothing
admits less of affectation, and that is the rock that Ostentation always splits
upon, because it borders near upon vanity, and vanity is very subject to
contempt. It has need of great moderation, that it may not be offensive. For
the too much of it has already discredited it amongst men of parts. Sometimes
it consists in a dumb Eloquence, and in showing perfection without design. For
a wise dissimulation makes a plausible Parade; the same privation exciting
curiosity the more. Its greatest art is, not to show all its perfection at
once, but by degrees, and as if one were a-painting of it, to discover it the
more. A lovely pattern ought to oblige men to show somewhat still more lovely,
and the applause given to the first piece, makes the Spectatours impatient to
see the rest.

This Maxim is taken from the Author's Apologue, entitled, Hombre de
Ostentation, the Abstract whereof shall serve for a Commentary.

What is not seen, says he, is as if it were not in being. All knowledge is
nothing, if others are ignorant of that thou know, said a great Satyrist.

Scire tuum nihil est, nisi te scire hoc sciat alter. Pers. Things go not for
what they are, but for what they appear to be. There are many more fops than
men of wit. Those are satisfied with appearance; and though these stick to the
substance, yet deceit prevails, and makes all things to be valued according to
the outside. And a page after. Know, said the Ambassadors of the other Birds,
to the Peacock, that all our Re-publick is offended at thy insupportable Pride.
For it is an odious piece of singularity in thee, that thou alone must spread
thy vain tail before the Sun, which no other Bird dares to do, though there be
many that have better right to do it than thou have. And therefore thou art
commanded by an irrevocable sentence, to abstain for the future from
signalizing thy self, etc. To which the Peacock made answer: Why do you condemn
in me the Ostentation, and not the Beauty? Heaven that has bestowed this upon
me, has in like manner complemented me with the other. What would reality
signify to me without show? Politicians now adays moot nothing else, but that
the greatest Wisdom consists in making it appear. To know, and to know how to
set it off, is doubly to know. For my own part, I would say of Ostentation,
what others say of good fortune, that an ounce of Ostentation is better than
pounds of capacity without it. What signifies it, though a thing be excellent,
if it appear not? And two pages after. It is a politic Problem, whether or
not reality be better than appearance. There are things great in themselves,
which appear not, and others that are inconsiderable, which appear much. So
great effect produces the having or wanting Ostentation. There are men in whom
the little makes a great show, and whose much is a subject of admiration. These
are men of Parade; for when excellence and appearance concur, they form a
Prodigy. On the contrary, we have seen eminent persons, who have not appeared
to be one half of what they were, for want of the dexterity of Ostentation. It
is not long since, that a great Man, who in the field drove all before him,
being called to a Council of War, was afraid of every body. He, that was so
proper for action, was not at all for speaking. Ostentation gives a true luster
to Heroic Qualities, and, as it were, a second being to all things: that is to
say, if reality vouch for it. For without merit, it is but a vulgar cheat: it
serves only to manifest defects, and by consequent to beget contempt instead
of applause. Some make a great bustle to get out and appear upon the Theater of
the World, and all they do is to publish the ignorance, which retirement
civily concealed. But that is not to make Ostentation of Talents, but foppishly
to declare ones faults.

MAXIM CCLXXVIII.
In all things to avoid being remarkable.
By being so too much, perfections themselves will be defects. This comes of
singularity, and singularity has always been censured,. Whoever affects to be
singular, must live by himself. Politeness it self is ridiculous, if it be
excessive; it offends, when it glares too much to the Eye. Upon much stronger
reason ought extravagant singularities to be nauseous. Nevertheless some would
be known even by their vices to that degree, that they seek out Novelty in
wickedness, and glory in having so bad a Reputation. Nay, in the matter of
ability it self, the too much degenerates into quacking.

MAXIM CCLXXIX.
To suffer Contradiction without Gainsaying.
It is to be distinguished when Contradiction proceeds from Cunning or
Clownishness. For it is not always an Opinionativeness, sometimes it is
Artifice. Take heed then not to engage into the one, nor to stumble into the
other. There is no pains better bestowed than in spying: nor no better
counter-battery against those, who would pick the lock of the heart, than to
put the key of reserve in the inside. See the Maxim 179.

MAXIM CCLXXX.
The man of good stuff.
Honesty and integrity are gone: obligations are forgotten. There are but few
good Correspondences. The best service has the worst reward. This is the guise
of the World now a days. There are whole Nations inclined to evil. Of the one,
the treachery is always to be feared; of others the inconstancy; and of some
the cheating. Make use then of the bad Correspondence of others, not as an
example to be imitated; but as a warning to be upon thy guard. Integrity runs a
risque of being warped at the sight of a dishonest procedure; but a good man
never forgets what he himself is, because of what others are.

MAXIM CCLXXXI.
The approbation of knowing Men.
An indifferent yea of a great man is more to be valued than the applause of a
multitude. When there is a bone in the windpipe, to snuffle is not to breath.
The wise speak with judgment, and by consequent, their approbation gives
complete satisfaction. Prudent Antigonus placed his whole Renown in the single
testimony of Zeno. And Plato called Aristotle his whole School. Some mind only
the filling of their Bellies, without minding that the Commons are but
ordinary. Sovereigns themselves stand in need of good Writers, whose Pens are
more to be feared by them, than a Picture to the life, by the ugly.

MAXIM CCLXXXII.
To make absence an expedient, for being respected, or esteemed.
If presence lessen Reputation, absence increases it. He who being absent is
taken for a Lion, appears but a Mouse, when present. Perfections lose their
luster, if they be looked upon at too near distance: because men look more upon
the back of the outside, than the substance and inside of the mind. Imagination
goes much farther than the sight: and the mistake that commonly enters by the
Ears, goes out by the Eyes. He that rests in the center of the good Opinion,
that People have of him, preserves his Reputation. The Phoenix it self makes
use of retirement and desire, to make it self to be the more esteemed and
regrated.

MAXIM CCLXXXIII.
The Man of good invention.
Invention marks a fruitfulness of wit. But where is it to be found without a
grain of folly? Invention is the share of quick wits, and the good choice that
of solid judgments. The former is rarer, and more esteemed, inasmuch as many
have succeeded in choosing well, and very few in inventing well, and in having
the precedence of excellence, as well as that of time. Novelty is insinuant,
and if it be happy, it sets a double value upon what is good. In matters that
concern judgment, it is dangerous, because it runs upon Paradoxes; in knacks of
subtilty it is laudable: and if Novelty and invention jump well together, they
are plaufible.

MAXIM CCLXXXIV.
Meddle not in other men's business, and thine own will go well.
Esteem thy self, if thou would be esteemed. Be rather covetous than prodigal
of thy self. Make thy self to be desired, and thou shall be well received.
Never come till thou be called, and never go till thou be sent. He that engages
of his own head, incurs all the hatred, if he succeed not; and though he
succeed, he is not liked the better for it. A man that is too intrigueing, is
the But of contempt: and as he introduces himself without shame, he is repulsed
with confusion.

MAXIM CCLXXXV.
Not to lose ones self with another.
Know, that he who is in the mire, calls thee not, but to comfort himself at
thy cost, when thou art bemired with him. The unfortunate look out for some
body, to help them to bear their affliction. He who in prosperity turned his
back, will in adversity stretch forth his hand. Consider well that thou may
not be drowned, by endeavoring to help those who are a-drowning.

MAXIM CCLXXXVI.
Suffer not thy self to be obliged, nor by all sorts of People.
For that would be to become a common slave. Some are born to be more happy
than others; the first for doing of good, and the others for receiving it.
Liberty is more precious than all gifts: and to receive, is to lose it. It is
better to keep others in dependence, than to depend upon one alone. The only
advantage of Sovereignty is, that it can do more good. Above all, have a care
not to reckon any obligation as a favor. Be persuaded, that men most commonly
seek to oblige, that they may engage.

MAXIM CCLXXXVII.
Never to act in passion.
Otherwise, all will be spoiled. Let him that is not himself, have a care not
to do any thing by himself. For passion always banishes reason. Let him then
substitute a prudent Mediator, who will be so, if he be without passion.
Standersby judge better than the Gamesters, because they fall not into passion.
When one finds himself moved, retentiveness should beat the retreat, lest the
choler may be more heated. For then every thing would be done violently, and by
some minutes of fury, one would prepare to himself a subject of long
repentance, and great repining.

MAXIM CCLXXXVIII.
To live according to occasion.
Whether it be action, or discourse, all ought to be squared according to the
time. We must resolve; when we can, for Time and Tide stays for no man.
Regulate not thy life by general Maxims, unless it be in favor of Virtue.
Prescribe no positive laws to thy will: for thou will be forced next day to
drink of the same water which thou despisest to day. Some men's impertinence is
so whimsical, that they would have all the circumstances of a project quadrate
to their madness, instead of accommodating themselves to circumstances. But a
Wise Man knows that to conform to the times, is the North Star of Prudence.

MAXIM CCLXXXIX.
What most discredits a Man, is to show that he is man.
He is no longer reckoned Divine, so soon as he is known to have much in him of
man. Levity is the greatest counterpoise of Reputation. As a grave man passes
for more than man, so a light shittlecock is hardly reckoned a man. No vice
discredits so much as levity, inasmuch as it is diametrically opposed to
gravity. A light man cannot be substantial, and especially if he be old, seeing
his age requires more Prudence. And though this fault be very common, yet it is
strangely derived in every particular person that has it.

MAXIM CCXC.
It Is a happiness to join esteem with affection.
To be respected, there is no need to be too much beloved. Love is bolder than
hatred. (Affection and veneration seldom agree together. And though it is not
fit to be too much feared, yet neither is it good to be too much beloved. Love
begets familiarity, and as fast as this comes in, esteem goes out. It is better
to be loved with respect, than with tenderness. That is the love which great
men require.

MAXIM CCXCI.
To know how to make an essay.
Let the address of a Judicious man counterbalance the reservedness of a
cunning man. A great judgment is required to measure the capacity of another.
It Is far better to know the character of minds, than the virtue of herbs and
stones. That is one of the greatest secrets of life. Metals are known by their
sound, and Men by their talk. Integrity is known by words, but much more ^y
deeds. In this, much penetration, circumspection and caution is required.

MAXIM CCXCII.
To be above, and not below ones Employment.
How great soever the station be, he who holds it, should show himself still to
be greater. A man that has wherewith, is still growing, and signalizes himself
more and more in his employments: whereas he that has a narrow heart, is soon
at a stand, and is at length reduced to an inability of performing his
obligations, and maintaining his Reputation. Augustus made it his honor to be
a greater Man than Prince. A great heart, and a reasonable confidence in ones
self are of great use here.

MAXIM CCXCIII.
Of Maturity.
It Is conspicuous in the garb, but much more in the manners. Material gravity
makes Gold precious, and Moral the Man. That gravity is the ornament of
Qualities, through the veneration that it attracts to them. The outside of Man
is the frontispiece of the Soul. Maturity is not a dull look, nor an
affectation of demure gestures, as Dunces say; but a well weighed Authority. It
speaks by sentences, and acts always to the purpose. It supposes a complete
man, that is to say, who is as much a great person, as a mature man. So soon as
a man ceases to be a Child, he begins to be grave, and to show his value.

MAXIM CCXCIV.
To be moderate in ones Opinions.
All judge according to their interests, and abound in their own sense. Most
men make reason give way to passion. Let two be of a contradictory Opinion, yet
each presumes to have reason on his side. But reason that has always been
faithful, has never had two faces. A Wise Man is to reflect upon so nice a
point: and thereby, his doubting will correct the head-strongness of others.
Let him sometimes go to his adversaries side, that he may examine what he
grounds upon, and that will hinder him from condemning him, and so easily
arrogating to himself the victory.

MAXIM CCXCV.
To be, and not seem to be a man of business.
Those who have least to do, would appear to be loaded with affairs. They make
a mystery of every thing, and that with the greatest silliness imaginable.
These are Cameleons of applause, but are heartily laughed at by every body.
Vanity is insupportable every where, but here it is flouted at. These little
Pismires of honor go a-begging the glory of great exploits. Show as little as
thou can thy most eminent qualities. Rest satisfied to do, and leave it to
others to talk of it. Give thy good actions, but sell them not. Golden Pens
must never be hired to write upon dirt; which is an Eyesore to all men of
sense. Strive rather to be a Hero, than to show it.

Those, (says he in the Chapter of his Discreet, entitled Hazasleria) pretend
to most business, who have least, because they go a-hunting after occasions,
and magnify them. They set a great value upon things that are worth less than
nothing. They make a mystery of every thing, and the smallest matter is to them
a Prodigy. All their affairs are the prime transactions of the world, and all
their actions exploits. Their whole life is a train of Miracles, to be
published by the Trumpet of Fame. They have nothing that is common, every thing
is singular in them, whether it be Valor, Knowledge, or Fortune. All vanity is
justly reckoned foppish, but bragging is intolerable. Wise Men make it more
their honor to be great, than to appear so. But these men rest satisfied with
the bare appearance. To love to appear is so far from being a mark of sublimity
in them, that on the contrary it is a demonstration of a low mind, since the
least thing appears as much to them as the greatest. Pride is offensive every
where, but chiefly here. They meet with contempt where they look for esteem.
When they fancy to themselves that they will be admired, they find themselves
exposed to the derision of all men. Their vanity proceeds not at all from the
greatness of Soul, but from the lowness of Heart, seeing they aspire not to
true honor, but only to shows; not to real exploits, but to brag of them,
without doing them. There are others, who would seem to be mighty Ministers,
great men for magnifying objects, there is no business small as to them, of
Atoms they make a great dust, and of a little a great noise. They give
themselves out for men overwhelmed in business, and by consequent, desirous of
repose and leisure. They speak only by mystery, their least gesture is a
subject of Divination. They make great exclamations, and then, that they may
the more surprise, stop short, like to the Machines of Gianello della Torre, of
as great noise, and as little profit. There is a great deal of difference, nay,
and contrariety betwixt great Doers, and great Talkers. For the more brave
actions the former do, the less they affect to speak of them. They are
satisfied to do, and leave it to others to tell what they have done; and
though others should be silent, yet the things themselves would sufficiently
speak. The second sell at a dear rate, what others give gratis. They publish it
with sound of Trumpet: and for want of Pens enough amongst those of Fame, they
hire golden Pens, (that is to say mercenary Pens) to make them write dirty
Characters. And then he concludes in these terms. The Pens of Fame are not of
Gold, because they are neither to be sold nor hired: but they have a better
sound than the finest Silver; they are of no value; but they bestow it upon
merit.

To this may be added what Diogenes said one day to a young bragadocio, who
alleged to him the multitude of his business: That it became him well to ape
the Woman.

MAXIM CCXCVI.
The man of value, and majestic qualities.
The great qualities make the great men. One of these alone is equivalent to
all the indifferent put together. Heretofore a man made it his honor to have
nothing but what was great in his house, even to the most common utensils. By
much stronger reason ought a great man to endeavor that all the qualities of
his mind be great. As every thing is immense and infinite in God, so ought all
things to be great and majestic in a Hero. So that all his actions, nay, and
all his words should be clothed with a transcendent majesty.

MAXIM CCXCVII.
To do all things, as in the presence of witnesses.
That is a man worthy of consideration, who considers that men behold him, or
will behold him. He knows that the walls hear, and that wicked actions would
rather burst than not get out. Even then when he is alone, he acts as if he
were in the presence of all men, because he knows that all things will be
known. He looks upon these as present witnesses, who by their discovery will be
so afterward. That man was not afraid that his Neighbors should keep a
Register of all he did in his house, who desired that all men might see it.

MAXIM CCXCVIII.
The ready Wit, the profound Judgment, and the quaint Discerning.
These three things make a Prodigy, and are the greatest gift of Divine bounty.
It is a great advantage to conceive well, a greater to reason well, and above
all to have a good understanding. Wit ought not to be in the backbone, which
would render it more painful than sharp. To think well is the fruit of being
rational. At twenty years of age the Will reigns; at thirty the Wit; at forty,
the Judgment. There are Wits, which, like the eyes of the Lynx, of themselves
send forth light, and are most intelligent, when the obscurity is greatest.
There are others, who are extemporary, and hit always upon that which is
pattest to the purpose. They are always ready furnished, and with what is good
too. A most happy fecundity. But a discerning judgment seasons the whole life.

MAXIM CCXCIX.
To leave with an Appetite.
Men are to be left with the Nectar upon their lips. Desire is the standard of
esteem. Even in bodily thirst, it is a skillful management to provoke it, and
not to satisfy it wholly. The good is doubly good, when there is but little of
it. The abatement is great at the second bout. Too full an enjoyment is
dangerous. For it causes the highest perfection to be despised. The only rule
to please is to find an appetite left with a desire. If it be to be provoked,
let it rather be by the impatience of longing, than the glut of enjoyment. A
felicity that costs pains, gives double contentment.

MAXIM CCC.
In a word, to be Holy.
That is to say all at once. Virtue is the chain of all perfections, and the
center of all felicity. It renders a man prudent, attentive, circumspect, wise,
valiant, reserved, sincere, fortunate, plausible, true, and a Hero in all
things. Three things make him happy, Health, Wisdom, and Holiness. Virtue is
the Sun of the Microcosme, and a good Conscience is its Hemisphere. It is so
lovely, that it gains the favor both of Heaven and Earth. Nothing but it is
amiable, and nothing hateful but Vice. Virtue is a thing in good earnest,
every thing else is but mockery. Capacity and Grandeur are to be measured by
Virtue, and not by fortune. Virtue stands in need of nothing but it self. It
renders man amiable in this life, and memorable after death.
