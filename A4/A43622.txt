The History of Whiggism, From their Rise, to their late horrid and
Unparalled CONSPIRACY.
To the Tune of, When the Stormy Winds do Blow:
YOu Calvinists of England,
Who surfeit with your Ease,
^^d strive to make us Whigland,
To breed a foul Disease:
^^arken you painted Saints,
For we will let you know,
^h, the Cares and the Fears
That by you Whigs do grow!
^he first of your Pretensions
When that you did begin,
Were gloss'd with good Intentions,
But false at Heart within:
^o Faith in you was ever found,
That Truth we plainly know,
and the Cares and the Fears
That by you Whigs do grow.
Queen Elizabeth she did descry,
And soon found what you were;
^he made fit Laws against you
By Parliament appear;
Which late you would have Repealed,
But Just CHARLES too well did know,
^ll the Cares and the Fears
That by you Whigs do grow!
^uch Locusts in the Nation
King JAMES could never love;
Wherefore he thought discretion
T'advise his Son t'disprove
Of all your false pretended Zeal;
For wisely he did know,
Oh; the Cares and the Fears
That by you Whigs do grow!
When best of Kings and Princes
Did give your hearts desire,
Yet you were not contented,
To the Crown you did aspire;
You said you would make Him Great,
Indeed you did do so;
But oh, the Cares and the Fears
Attends such Winds that blow!
On the Mitre you did trample,
To make your selves more high,
With greater force to give the stroke
Against His Majesty:
Ah! false and traiterous Tekelites,
Such ways to let us know
The great Cares and the Fears
That by you Whigs to grow!
The Whig he then stood rampant,
To us he gave his Laws;
Yet such he dare not vaunt on it,
So sharp we felt his Claws:
You then laid open what you were,
And smartly made us know
Oh, the Cares and the Fears
That by you Whigs do grow!
The Blessed Martyr's Royal Son,
Whom Heaven guarded sure,
And made us happy by's Return,
Him you could not endure:
Against His Life you did conspire,
And Mighty JAMES also;
Oh, the Cares and the Fears
That by you Whigs do grow!
Peace, Plenty, and all that is good,
Through His Conduct we have:
Ungrateful Souls! to seek his Blood
Who seeks us for to save;
And by your late Rebellious ways
Again to make us know,
Oh, the Cares and the Fears
That by you Whigs do grow!
With furious Zeal you do inflame,
And cause our Countries burn:
You work Confusion, but the blame
On Innocents you turn.
Your holy Masque is dropping off,
God grant it may do so,
And stop the Cares and the Fears
That by you Whigs do grow.
May College, Rouse, and Hone, their Fate
On Traitors all attend;
What though it seems a little late?
Yet still we know your end.
Just Vengeance does not sleep,
Though you do think it so;
You Will have your shares of the Cares
That by you Whigs do grow.
Long live Great CHARLES, our Pious King,
Who cares when we do sleep,
To keep still safe under his Wing
From Ravenous Wolves his Sheep;
He us preserves from Bears Clutch,
The Lions Jaw also,
And from all Cares and all Fears
That by you Whigs do grow.
