Three General Epistles, etc.
Amsterdam the 15 th. of the 11th. Month 1662.
MY dear Brethren and Beloved Sisters in the pure, holy and heavenly Relation,
who are sons and daughters of one Father, and heirs of one Kingdom, begotten
through the one Eternal Word of Life, which lives and abides for ever; With the
salutation of my dearest love do I greet you all, and with strong and vehement
desires to the Lord, do I wish, that love and life, joy and peace, grace and
mercy may be multiplied among you all, to the filling of every of your earthen
Vessels, to the refreshing of every weary soul, and to the making glad of every
sorrowful heart among you.

I hope (my dearly beloved) you are not forgetful of the wonderful kind Love of
our God, which he manifested to us in the day of our visitation, how he sought
us out that were as lost sheep going astray, that he might bring us unto
himself, who is the chief Shepherd and Bishop of our souls, how he took us as
perforce from our Lovers, that our hearts and affections might be set upon him,
and that our souls might love him above all; how he broke us, that he might
bind us up; how he blinded us, that he might make us see; how he wounded us,
that he might heal us; how he impoverished us, that he might make us rich; how
he weakened us, that he might make us strong: and how he proved and cried us as
gold that is seven times tried in the fire; that we might finally become his
Jewels; though then we knew not whether that we should become Vessels of honor
or dishonor: And since that day of blessed Visitation, how has his endless
love abounded toward us! how plentifully has his Wisdom and Power been
manifested amongst us! And what wonderful things have we seen him since bring
to pass by the Arm of his Power, not only to our admiration, but also to the
astonishment of his Enemies: And oh! how has he brought down Principalities,
and shaken powers inwardly and outwardly! how has he overturned, overturned
that which has been exalted inwardly and outwardly that that which has been
abased, might be exalted! how has he confounded the wisdom of the wise, and
brought the understanding of the Prudent to nothing! how has he scattered them
that were gathered, and not by him, that he might gather that which was
scattered from him! Oh the Wonders that he has wrought in the Earth, they are
innumerable! And the noble acts that he has done in the Earth, who can declare
them to the utmost? Nevertheless, we will be speaking of them (when thereunto
moved by his spirit) that we thereby may show forth his praise, who through his
making us Witnesses of them, has made truly glad our hearts and souls, which
have cause to rejoice in him, notwithstanding his trying of us with many
trials, and his proving of us through many temptations and tribulations, which
many have been exercised in; and that diverse manner of vvays. Yet let us not
faint, nor let slip the confidence that we have in him; for as certain as we
have seen his Wonders in the Earth, so certainly has he wrought several of
them for good toward us; and as certainly as he has dealt gently and
favorably with us, so assuredly has he loved us: And as certainly as his
glorious Work is begun in the Earth, so assuredly will he make known his Name
and Power even unto the ends of the Earth: And as certainly as his adversaries
oppose him and his Truth, so assuredly shall they be broken as the potsherds of
the Earth; and as certainly as his lambs and babes now mourn and are aff^cted,
so assuredly shall they rejoice and be comforted: And as certainly as the
Wicked are now set up, so assuredly shall they fall: And as certainly as
iniquity abounds, so assuredly shall it have an end: And as certainly as the
name of the Lord is blasphemed and dishonored, so assuredly shall it be
glorified and exalted in the earth: And as certainly as Gods Truth is now
trampled upon, and rejected by thousands, so assuredly shall it be advanced and
received by ten thousands; and though my eye should not see the fulfilling of
these things, yet I will rejoice, and do rejoice in the Testimony that J have,
that these things shall come to pass. And my soul inviteth you (my dear
brethren and sisters) to come and rejoice with me in the assurance which God
gives us of the certainty of these things, which shall as certainly be
fulfilled, as it is certain that the things before mentioned are come to pass
since the Lord omnipotent first visited us.

Wherefore (my dearly beloved) look not out at the present blackness and
darkness which represents it self upon the face of the Earth, by reason of the
many clouds which hang over the Earth: But look at the Day Star which is a
risen in your hearts, which precedes the sons of righteousness, which though he
yet seem to be darkened, yet as certainly as the Lord Jehovah is in the highest
Heavens, so assuredly shall this Sun of Righteousness arise, and shine
gloriously in the hearts of the sons of men; and then shall just Judgment be
set up in the Earth, and the Inhabitants thereof they shall learn
righteousness; then shall Wickedness and Oppression have an end, Cruelty and
Tyranny shall have no place, and Deceit and Unrighteousness shall wither, and
the Works and Workers of iniquity shall go to decay: And then shall the joyful
song of deliverance be sung by the ransomed ones of the Lord; then shall the
voice of joy and gladness be heard in our Land; then shall babes and sucklings
learn the song of Zion, and the sons and daughters of the Most High shall make
a heavenly pleasant melody, and great will be the joy and delight of the Lords
chosen, even such, as that their present sufferings shall not be worthy to be
compared to the same.

Therefore O ye my suffering Friends, be ye comforted, be ye comforted of the
Lord, and comfort ye one another with the assurance which God has given unto
some of his servants, of the certainty of these things coming to pass, of which
I believe some of you will be eyewitnesses, and partakers with the Saints in
Light; and my confidence is, That neither principalities nor powers shall be
able to deprive you thereof, though they should be permitted to deprive you of
your liberty, of your estates, and of the society of Friends: And if your
Heavenly Father should suffer such things to come to pass for the trial of your
precious Faith, be not ye therefore dejected, as if you were altogether left
comfortless, and should so perpetually remain; For I testify unto you, That
our Heavenly Father has re^erved enough in store, not only to comfort you
withal in this life, but also in the life to come.

And now therefore as a servant of the Lord God to you all (who writes these
things with tears unto you) do I in his Name beseech you to be faithful and
obedient, quiet and peaceable children, behaving your selves as Lambs, or as
newborn babes in his sight in this generation, lest you should provoke him
through your disobedience, by being unfaithful and unquiet in his house; and
they that are, or become so, they must be excluded and shut out too, among them
that are without, -- without love, faith, hope, peace, comfort and refreshment,
in the reprobate state, where the rents, schisms, strivings, divisions,
envyings and hatings are, which are the fruits which they produce that go out
from the Spirit, in which love, joy, and everlasting peace is. Therefore I
exhort and beseech you all, to walk together in this one Spirit, to meet
together to serve the Lord in this one Spirit, that you may be like-minded, and
that the fruits of it may abound in and among you plenteously, to the glory of
him that has visited you with the dayspring from on high, and has opened a
Fountain for you, and has prepared a Feast of fat things for you, and withal a
rest for your weary souls.

Wherefore faint not in the day of your adversity, lest your Enemies vaunt
themselves, as if your God would not preserve you in unity, love, peace and
patience, in which you had need to continue, lest that the Enemy within or
without, should get an advantage against you, which might easily be, if
prejudice should be permitted to have place in any of you one against another;
and thereby might the Lord be provoked to jealousy against you. And therefore
above all things, let brotherly love continue, that through your love to the
Father, one to another, and to all men, it may evidently appear that you are of
your Father the Lord Jehovah, who is love, and who delights in love and mercy,
both which I ^ear him record he has richly vouchsafed unto you, my dearly
beloved, unto whom in his love I have writ this in brief, which to that end I
received from him, and which J have now finally communicated to you, or rather
the Spirit of the Lord through me his servant, and your dear and faithful
brother in the one truth,

William Caton.

Greetings of strength in the holy life; and salutations of endeared love, to
the rising seed of the invisible God, every where as this may come.
A Salutation of Love from the motion of the Spirit of Life and Love, sent to
all that are of the Royal birth, and are of the Seed immortal, and of the Flock
of God, who in this his blessed and glorious day, his Fold of Rest are come to
know; and are waiting to feel the same more and more, to be read in the fear
and wisdom of God.

All you tender Lambs who are gathered out of the World and its evil ways and
customs, by the powerful Arm of the living God, in that which is pure dwell, low
in the pure holy fear, and your good Shepherds Fold you will feel; and therein
do you abide, and you will be safe in the storms, and from the terrors and
affrightments of the wild Beasts of the field, and the Wolves of the night will
not be able to come near your dwellings, to enter your holy habitation, nor to
touch your Life, for from them it will be hid in God; And Friends, therein watch
and wait, and the good Shepherds voice you will come to hear, who speaks peace
to all his Lambs and little ones, that are of an upright heart, who wait upon,
fear and trust in him; and in so doing you will also feel his Eternal Arm made
bare for your salvation, deliverance and defense: And all you children of the
Day of God which has sprung from on High, by which he has visited and called
unto you even by the good Word of his Grace, by which he has begotten you
again, and chosen you to be his Inheritance and generation, which has sprung
up from the Seed of Life, which the Father and Fountain of Love and Life has
shed abroad in this the day of his large kindness and rich mercy, which in your
hearts in measure you have felt: Oh dear friends, let the eye of your minds be
always fixed and fastened upon the same, even upon that in which the God and
Father of Mercies has so exceeding largely extended himself unto you, and in
which he has abundantly appeared in the manifestation of his loving kindness
toward you, in begetting you again which were strayed, and in gathering you
that were scattered afar off, and lost from him, and in raising you up to be a
people to himself, that were not his people, and in begetting you to be his
children, that were sometimes strangers, and in the alienation; and all this
has he done for you of his own good will, in the riches of his free grace, when
there was no worthiness at all in you, even when you were wallowing in your
filth, when you were in your blood, and no eye pitied you, even that was the
time of his Love. Oh my dear Friends! I say, prize this his large Love, and
forget not those his benefits, but dwell in the sense and feeling thereof; so
that from the virtue of his Love felt in your hearts, you may receive daily
strength and growth in the Heavenly Life of Righteousness and true Holiness,
that so the Image of your Heavenly Father you may come to bear more and more
every day, and may live, walk, and abide therein to his praise, a chaste,
peculiar people, a chosen generation, zealous of good works, and hating the
very appearance of evil, that so you may be manifest unto all men, that you are
of the Household of Faith, children of Truth, and of the Family of the living
God, who are sitting in the Heavenly places in Christ, and know and feel the
Table of the Lord, and are feeding together on the Bread of Life which comes
down from above, which the World are ignorant of; and drinking of the Cup of
Blessing, in which you may feel and taste of the salvation of God, to the
comforting of your souls, and gladding of your hearts, by which you may be
strengthened and enabled to do the Will and Requirings of the Lord, either in
doing or in suffering. Oh you dear Babes and tender Plants, you that have felt
of the sweetness of the Milk of the Breast of Consolation, when you were ready
to pine for want, and have been watered with that which came from the
everlasting Spring and Well of salvation, in a time of great drought. Oh dear
hearts! I say again, abide in the feeling of the same, that so you may always
see and behold the hand of God's mighty power, that he has reached out unto
you, and watch thereto, and wait therein to receive more and more of the
Heavenly Virtue and dew from above, that so you may grow as the Lillies, and
spread forth as the Trees that are planted by the Rivers side, bringing forth
fruits of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, bringing forth fruit in due
season, wherein you will be lovely to the Father, and one unto another; and so
in the Love and Life abiding, and keeping in the unity, you will be known to be
the planting of the Lord, to the glory of his most holy Name. And tender
Friends, and little ones, I exhort you in the Name and fear of the Lord, to
watch against, and to be aware of suffering any root of bitterness to spring up
amongst you, or of harboring any prejudice one against another; but in that
Spirit of Love dwell, which thinks no evil, nor is not easily provoked; for that
which gives offense, and that which takes the offense, is one, and comes from
the same old root of bitterness, and proceeds from him that watches to divide
and devour, and to break the unity amongst the Lambs, and to make a prey, a
rent, a division, and a spoil; and if any are overtaken in these things for
want of a diligent watch to their thoughts, words and actions, in it the Enemy
will have a great advantage to hurt your peace, and to weaken you. And
therefore dear friends, be tender one to another; let the strong bear with the
weak, and be you pitiful and tender-heatted toward the bruised Reeds, that
have been hurt by the subtilty of the Enemy, and let your bowels earn over any
in whom there is yet remaining a little Love or Zeal, though it be but as a
smoking Flax; or of any that are wounded by reason of their fall which they
have taken in the Evening-tide. I say again in God's fear, Be very tender to
any such that in the spirit of love and meekness such may be restored, if so it
may be: For Friends, you your selves may be tempted, snared and overtaken by
the subtle Enemies bait; and therefore let all that think they stand, fear
continually, and take heed lest they also fall. And Friends, beware of watching
over one another with an evil eye; for that watches for the evil, and does not
see the good; and by that the good manners is, and has been corrupted, and
they that watch with that eye, they provoke to evil, and not to good. And
Friends, it lies upon me to warn you to take heed of looking back to Egypt, or
to any thing that you have left behind; but pass on, and let your eye be to
that which is before, and abide in the way in which you have begun to walk, and
in the patience dwell, and keep to the good Word thereof, that in the Faith you
may be found, that so the old Enemy may not beguile you, and so you come to be
dispossessed of the blessing through disobedience; therefore to your Guide
keep, and faithfully follow him, and take heed of staying behind, and beware of
being too forward in going before; for there is danger in both, of being
overcome with the Enemy: In staying behind, you will be guilty of disobedience,
and so not only lose your reward, and the blessing of rest and peace; but you
will have that Talent taken away which you do possess, and you will have your
portion where will be weeping and gnashing of teeth: And he that goes before,
will be puffed up above his measure, and so forget the Lord, and he will have his
portion also with the wicked. Therefore I do exhort and warn you all to take
heed of an evil heart of unbelief, and of departing from the living God: Be you
all therefore steadfastly grounded, settled and staid in your minds, unmovable,
upon the everlasting Foundation of God that stands sure, that so you may not
be tossed, turned aside, nor easily shaken in your minds, from that which you
have believed, nor weakened in your confidence, but that you may hold out unto
the end, and then you will assuredly receive your reward, if you faint not: So
you that have believed in the Truth, take heed of fainting, and beware of
hunting abroad; for my Friends, there may be erring on the right hand, as well
as on the left; therefore to your Leader keep, and dwell low in the pure fear,
and so the Cross you will be led into, and then you will feel that which will slay
your Enemies on every hand; for of a truth friends, there is no safety out of
the fear, nor prosperity out of the Cross; therefore let your resolution be for
ever therein to dwell, and then you will obtain the Crown, and reap the Blessing
that is everlasting. So remember, it was he that hunted abroad, that fainted,
and sold his Birthright for a little of the earthly enjoyment, to satisfy his
earthly desire, and so he lost the blessing: Therefore all dear Lambs and
little ones keep at home, and dwell in your own habitation, in the Light, the
House of the living God, and be you faithful unto him in all things that he
does require, that so none might deprive you of your blessed Inheritance, nor
take away your Crown of glory, joy, rest and peace.

And Friends, Brethren and Sisters, children of God, think it not strange that
we have trial upon trial; and if the Furnace of affliction comes to be heat
more hotter, yet look not out thereat, be valiant for the Lord, and for his
Truth upon the Earth, and in that stand which is immovable; for this I have
seen in the eternal Light, that there will be a day of dividing and separating
between the precious and the vile, the good metal and the dross, between the
weighty Wheat, and the light airy chaff; between the meek, gentle, patient
sheep, and the rough rugged Goats; the vile in nature shall no longer be hid
under a false, outside form of likeness, without the Power and Life, that dross
shall no longer abide among the good Metal, to darken the brightness thereof;
for the day is come that burns as an Oven; the Furnace is already kindled, and
the Refiners fire is lighted, which will try each matter, metal and work, of
what sort it is, neither shall the chaff any longer cover the good Wheat, but by
the Arm of Gods Eternal Power will be threshed off, and blown away with the wind
of his wrath; for he is come whose Fan is in his hand, by which he will scatter
the chaff, and the wheat he will gather into his Garner, therein to be
preserved; and he will also purge his Floor in this his notable day, and all the
gentle, meek and patient sheep on his right hand he will set, where the fullness
of joy, mercy, peace and pleasures are for ever, and for evermore; when as the
rough and brutish Goat^ shall be separated on the left hand, to receive the
curse, having walked out of the way of righteousness, which is the way of
peace; in that therefore (dear Friends) all abide, which will make you fruitful,
and to abound in every good word and work; for this is the day wherein he is
come to seek for fruit, and blessed will all they be that are found in the
Faith, for its they that are in the Vine, and therein abide, which will yield
unto the Lord living fruit of obedience, and every Tree will be clearly known of
what sort they are, by their fruit; for no man can gather grapes of Thorns, or
figs of thistles: Therefore all to the Vine come, that the nature thereof you
may feel, that so fruitful unto the Lord you may all be in this his glorious
day, to the praise and glory of his most holy Name; for I have also seen in the
Spirit of the living God, that there will be a mighty fierce storm, a very great
tempest, and a shaking time, such as has not yet been upon the Earth, by which
those trees that are fruitless, dead and dry, which has stood for a time, and
made a show, yet do but cumber the ground, and are rotten at the root, are not
well settled and fastened upon the true Foundation, in the good ground, they will
be turned up, and laid low, as without it has been seen, in which the Lord
has shown his mighty Power, though the blind do not see nor regard the
operation of his hand. And after that great and notable day of the Lord in
which many of the lofty Hills and high Mountains will be overturned and levelled
thereby, and the tall Cedars and the sturdy Oaks will be made to bend and bow,
and many great old buildings will be thrown off its rotten Foundation; then I
say, in that day those that do stand and abide firm and well fastened, they will
be exceeding faithful, to the praise and glory of the Lord, and such his good
Trees that are bringing forth fruit unto him in this his day, them he will
purge, prune, dress, prop and preserve; and the wild Bores of the Forest,
(whose nature is to root, rend and tear) shall never be able to root them up,
neither shall the subtle Foxes of the Wood have power to crop and spoil their
tender branches, that abide in the living Vine; neither shall they ever be able
to hinder them from clustering, for the Lord God will guard them by his Power,
and uphold them by his Eternal Arm, as hitherto he has done; neither will he
suffer the Swine to destroy his young Plants that are newly coming up; but by
his power they shall be fenced, nourished and kept. And so all my dear Friends,
be not at all discouraged, although the Furnace may yet be hot; for the Lord
will not suffer his Gold to come to loss therein, but he will save and bring it
forth, all that the good Metal shall lose therein, shall be but its dross, that
it may shine the better in luster, to the honor of the Lord; and also his good
sheep he will not suffer to be devoured by those old black Bloodhounds that
thirst for blood: Oh! no, no, my Friends, he will preserve them, because they
are his own gathered by his own hand, and are profitable unto him: Therefore I
say, he will take care of them; and though he do suffer the dogs (which are
without the fear) loose a little to course them, and drive them up in holes and
pines for a season, it is but that they may be driven from those rotten bogs of
this Worlds enjoyments and delights, which might otherwise be hurtful for them
to feed upon, that they might be driven nearer to himself, and one unto
another, to wait upon the Lord, and to feed together upon the Life that is
Immortal, and to lie down in his Fold of rest, peace and joy, which will last
for ever. And so my dear Friends* Brethren and Sisters, Lambs and Babes, what
ever the Lord our good Shepherd suffers to come to pass, or to be acted against
us in the Heathens wrath and Enemies rage, he will turn it to his own praise,
and for our good, and the remainder of the wrath and rage of the wicked he will
restrain. Therefore blessed are all you of the Lord, that can say of a truth,
he is your good Shepherd. So dear Lambs and Babes, Plants and Children of the
Lord, in the Light live, walk, and for ever abide, and you will have unity and
fellowship with the Father, and one with another; and so in the holy awe, and
pure dread of the Lord God Almighty, stand continually, and the peace and
blessing of the Lord will be felt by you, and multiplied in and amongst you, to
the glory of his most holy Name, to whom be all glory given, honor and praise
rendered, with living obedience and thanksgiving for ever and for evermore,
Amen says my soul.

So dear Friends, take this as a testimony of my love to you all who are of my
Fathers Flock, from one that is of the same Fold with you, and your Friend and
Brother in the Kingdom, suffering and patience of the Lord Jesus, who am called
and known to many by

Richard Greenway.
Written the sixth day of the ninth Month, 1662. in the County-Gaol, called the
High Gaol at Exon, where I suffer outward Bonds (for my obedience to the
Command of God, and for abiding in the Doctrine of the Lord Jesus christ) by
the wills of unreasonable men; and I in patience wait therein, until the Lord
God arise in his Power, and plead my innocent cause in the hearts of my
persecutors, or in his own way and time work my deliverance.
A Second Salutation to the flock of God every where in outward Bonds and at
liberty, who are born of the immortal Seed, and redeemed from the Earth, and
separated from the evil that is in this World, and called to be Saints, and
quickened by the power and operation of the Spirit of Life, and sanctified by
the Word of Truth, and are (in this day of trial) found faithful to the Lord in
doing or suffering for that precious Truth which makes free from sin and death,
and keeps us above all the fears, threatenings, and terrors of man, whose power
is from beneath, and soon passes away. Oh! unto you my heart is opened, and
streams of unfeigned Love from the incomings of the Fountain of Life, runs
forth unto you all abundantly, who am the least among many Brethren, but not
the least in love to you: Oh my dearly beloved Brethren and Sisters, as you
suffer for God's living Truth upon the Earth in any measure, I suffer with you,
and am one with you, and am afflicted with you: Oh my dear Friends, apply your
hearts, and give up your selves to, and for the service of the living God, and
diligently wait upon him in whom all our strength is, that you may be
strengthened and encouraged, enabled and furnished with power and might in the
Lord of Hosts, that you may not faint, nor be weary in your minds, but stay
your minds upon the God of Truth, that his blessing of peace may for ever
increase in all your habitations. And you dear Friends, you upon whom the ends
of the Earth is come, and in your hearts the day star is arisen, walk in the
Light thereof, that you may be wise, bold, strong and valiant, to follow the
Captain of our salvation, who is born King of the Jews; for its given to him to
rule all Nations, and to subdue the Kingdom of this World, but not by carnal
Weapons, but by his invisible Arm of Power, and Sword which proceeds out of his
mouth, whereby he will utterly confound, destroy and lay wast all that rebel and
stand up against him. Therefore my dear Friends, let your Faith stand in the
invisible Arm and Power of God, and be you all of a sound mind; be ye steadfast,
unmovable, rooted, grounded and established in the living Truth and
Righteousness of the God of all the Families of the Earth, that you may not be
moved, shaken, nor troubled in your minds at all these rumors of Wars, and
distress of Nations, and perplexity and wrath which must come to pass upon this
generation; but lift up your heads and rejoice, and let your eye be single,
always looking to, and following the Prince of Peace; and be not of a doubtful
mind, for the Lord of Hosts is with us, and the shout of a King is amongst us;
and although we have no helper in the earth, neither can make use of any carnal
weapons to defend or deliver our selves, yet in the faith and patient suffering
in, and for the Lamb of God that was slain, but now is alive, and lives for
evermore; in him we shall reign in victory, life and dominion, over all our
Enemies within and without. And my dear Friends, you are called to a glorious
freedom and liberty in the Spirit of Truth, stand fast in it, that you may keep
your consciences void of offense in the sight of God in all things; and if God
requires one thing, and man another, obey God, and fear not man, who can but
kill the body, that your souls may live in the dominion of Gods truth, and in it
meet and wait, and worship him, and go not with the uncircumcised in hearts and
ears; for the uncurable stroke of the Lord is near to be executed upon them;
neither return back again into Egypt, for the plagues, pestilence and famine
will be multiplied amongst them, til the Egyptians be confounded. Therefore dear
Friends, keep your constant watch in the true Light of the Son of the living
God, that you may receive counsel, wisdom, and discerning in every motion and
command, whether it be of flesh or spirit; for that which moves in the fleshly
part in your own particulars, you must take up the Cross of Christ to, in its
first motion and appearance, and let true judgment pass upon it; for if it
proceed forth either in act or word, it will wound your Consciences, and abuse
the power of God, and lead you into bondage again; and that which commands to
observe and do the thing conceived in the lust of the flesh, from the fleshly
birth either within or without, you are not to obey, for that will lead to the
second death; but the motion and command in the Spirit of Life you must in all
things do and follow, and in it you will live, and have perfect peace; and
therefore because we are born of the Spirit, and led by it, the world will
persecute us; therefore let every Soldier of Jesus Christ be contented with
his portion, which is tribulation in this World; but be of good cheer, the
Captain of our salvation has overcome the World: Therefore I say again in the
Name, fear and power of the Lord, be you faithful unto death, for he that shall
come, will come, and crown you with everlasting Life. And my dear Friends, if it
seems good in the sight of our God, that all the days of our appointed ^ime
in this life, may be days of trouble, persecution and affliction, yet be of
good comfort, this will be but for a moment, and will soon come to an end; but
the joy, rest, peace and glory which our God has prepared for us (as we love
him, and are faithful to him) shall never have an end. And so my dear Friends,
in the ^ear, love, obedience, worship and service of the God and Father of our
Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, for ever dwell and abide; in it I am firmly
united to you; and in that Love, Life and Truth of the living God, I dearly
salute and embrace you all and am as full of love with you, as I was when I
began to write; and whatsoever you suffer for your obedience to our God; and
keeping the commands of Christ, whether spoiling of Goods, imprisonment,
banishment, or death it self, I am resolved in the strength and power of God to
partake with you.

From your faithful Friend in the patient suffering for the Testimony of a good
Conscience, in the high Gaol at Exon, the 24 th. of the tenth Month 1662.
Christopher Bacon.

THE END.
