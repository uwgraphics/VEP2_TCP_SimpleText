THE HUE-and-SONG AFTER PATIENCE.
Have but a little PATIENCE, and you shall hear,
How PATIENCE had the Gift to Lie and Swear;
How PATIENCE could with PATIENCE stand a Lie;
(But PATIENCE wants to stand the PILLORY.)
Out of all PATIENCE, to the Hague He steers:
To stay He had not PATIENCE, for his EARS.
To the Tune of, Hail to the Myrtle Sbades.
I.
HAil to London fair Town
All hail to the Mayor and the Shrievs;
Hail to the Scarlet Gown,
Whose Sentence our Patience grieves:
Justice and Law have prevailed,
With PATIENCE a Verdict to find,
Against Patience, whose conscience failed;
Oh Patience! why art so blind?
II.
PATIENCE, the joy of the Town,
The comfort and hope of the Crowd;
PATIENCE, who got Renown,
By Perjury, Lies and Fraud:
PATIENCE who never had the Heart
His Sovereign's Rights to maintain;
But Patience he had the Art
To Swear and Forswear again.
III.
PATIENCE for Church and for State,
And Patience for Meetings by stealth;
PATIENCE, who would translate
The State to a Commonwealth:
Whose Zeal has his Patience betrayed,
To lie for the Saints in distress;
Nay, though he is Forsworn, ('it is said,)
He Swore he could do no less.
IV.
PATIENCE, whose Zeal did contrive
The Monument Figures and Spire,
That while there is a Papist alive
We may not forget the Fire:
The Pillory now is his Lot,
He has raised such a flame with his Crew,
That London is now too hot;
Oh Patience! where art thou now?
V.
PATIENCE for Zeal to the Cause,
Did preach to the Captives in Goal;
Patience, with great applause,
Gave large to an Hospital:
To USE now his Money may lend,
For Pomfret he will never more stand,
Nor Warrants for Tories send,
T'please Titus of the Perjured Band.
VI.
PATIENCE with Collar of Brass,
To woeful Disasters did fall;
Patience with Copper Face,
And a Conscience worse than all;
To Holland, to Holland he goes;
For plainly now it appears,
(That in spite of all Whiggish Laws,)
Ignoramus cannot save his Ears.
VII.
Some say that the Saints may not Swear,
But Lie even as much as they can;
Yet Patience in spite on's Ears,
Will Swear and Forswear again:
That Patience should be so far lost,
Alas! who with Patience can hear?
That a Saint should be Knight of the Post,
And an Elder without an Ear.
VIII.
Let every good Subject with Me,
Who Patience a Virtue does praise,
Lest he fall into Perjury,
With Patience pray for Grace.
But now I with Patience have done,
Lest with Patience I keep such a Rout,
That astray more with Patience run,
And weary your Patience out.
Printed in the Year of the Saints Tribulation, 1683.
