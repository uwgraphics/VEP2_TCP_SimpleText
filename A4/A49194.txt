EDINBURGH: Printed by Evan Tyler, Printer to the Kings most Excellent Majesty.
1646.

Good Reader,
I Understand that the right Honorable the Lord Chancellor of Scotland had
not right done him by the printed Copy of his Speech to the Kings Majesty at
New Castle, concerning the Propositions of Peace, there being in that Copy
Errors and Omissions, and both material; which has moved me to resolve, as to
print the former according to the true Copy, so for preventing the like
mistakes and mis-representations, first to procure to my self, and now to
communicate to the public view, the true transcrips of these last three
Speeches: In which thou shall find the merit of an excellent subject to speak
for it self, for thou have here a most solid, judicious, candid, and plain
debate, concerning the best and most hopeful means of attaining a speedy and
happy Peace, which may put a period to the lasting miseries of these three
Kingdoms: Read and consider, and beware thou do not receive with the left hand
what is reached forth with the right; This Noble Lord has dealt freely and
faithfully both with King and Parliament; and, as Truth and plain dealing did
appear in his Speeches, so what he spoke is here faithfully imparted; and thou
may be confident, that in this it holds true, (...)

Thine to serve thee for the Public good, G. A.

The Lord Chancellor of Scotland his first Speech: At a Conference in the
Painted Chamber with a Commit of both Houses, October. 1. 1646.
My Lords and Gentlemen,
THe end of this Conference is to advise what is fit to be done for the Peace
and Security of the Kingdoms in relation to the King, and how to dispose of
his Majesty's Person, which is a matter very ticklish, and of most high
concernment; and they who would build very high, must dig very low for a firm
foundation: And therefore I shall make bold to desire, That what ever we
resolve upon concerning the Kings Majesty, it may be done by joint advice and
consent of both Kingdoms, and that the Unity between the Kingdoms may be
inviolably preserved, as that wherein (next to Gods protection) the chief
strength of both lies, which would be laid as a ground of our future debates.
And because the purpose we are to speak of is very grave and serious, I shall
speak of it with that sincerity, as I wish my words were written with the beams
of the Sun, and registered to posterity, that all the world might see the candor
and integrity of our proceedings toward the King and our Brethren of England.
And (is I had occasion once to express in this place) so do I now say, That no
man has conscience nor honor who will not remember our solemn League and
Covenant, as the strongest bond under heaven between God and man, between man
and man, and between Nation and Nation, in which our Unity is founded upon
Verity in a threefold relation; to God, to the King, and amongst our selves.
The first is the greatest, and ascends as high as heaven: for Religion, which
has its name a religando, unites us to God himself: and so long as he is in
League with us, we need not fear who be against us. Let us therefore hold fast
our Unity in Religion, and beware of Toleration of all Religions, which is the
ready way to have none; for there is nothing more divine in God then Unity,
and nothing more Diabolical in the Devil then Division, who therefore is
known to the vulgar by his cloven foot to be the spirit of Division.

The next ground and relation of our Unity, is with the King, to whom we are
bound (in the strictest bonds of loyal Subjection) by our Allegiance and
Covenant, as to one Head and Monarch: and therefore the faithful endeavors of
both Kingdoms should (without wearying) be constantly contributed, That we may
be united to him by a happy and just Peace: For if one of the Kingdoms shall
cast off the King, and the other have a King; if the one shall make Peace with
the King, and the other not make Peace, but be still at variance with him, it
is to be feared, that no humane wit nor policy will be able to keep the two
Kingdoms long without a rupture; And if it please God so to incline the Kings
heart, and direct the wisdom of the Parliaments, as that the King and we
could make a happy agreement, no power or policy can be able to divide us;
for, Qui convenient uni tertio, convenient inter se.

The third ground and relation of our Unity, is the conjunction of the two
Kingdoms, which has been acknowledged to be so necessary and useful to both,
That they have often declared, they would stand and fall, and (like Hippocrates
twins) live and dye together. And therefore, as we regard our solemn Covenant
with God Almighty, and tender the standing and safety of the Kingdoms, let us
(with one heart and mind) join our Counsels and Actions, That whatsoever we
resolve upon for our common Peace and Security in relation to the King, and of
each Kingdom to other, that it be done in zeal to Religion, in loyalty to the
King, and with unanimity amongst our selves. And as the Pythagoreans did note
the number of Two with the mark of Infamy, ^erus ^ius ^is est pri^ausus disce^
ab u^e.
as being the first number that durst part from Unity; so, which soever of the
Kingdoms shall first violate the Unity which is bound up in our Covenant, may
apply it to themselves: But if we shall adhere to that Unity which is builded
upon the firm foundation of Verity, in our relations to Religion, the King, and
amongst our selves, it will be a threefold cord which is not easily broken;
and our Unity, I hope, shall be turned into an Identity, both Kingdoms may be
perfectly one.

Having thus in the first place laid a ground for Unity of Counsels and
Resolutions, I shall in the next place humbly desire and protest, That
whatever may be our Propositions or Debates concerning the King, it be not
mis-construed, as if one of the Kingdoms were imposing conditions upon the
other, or that we are absolutely wedded to any one desire more then to another;
but that (all several ways being amicably debated and rightly pondered,) That
which may serve most for the safety, security and happiness of the King and
both Kingdoms, may be gravely resolved upon. And now I come to the Question it
self, concerning the disposing of His Majesty's Person; first Negatively, and
then Positively. Negatively, the Question is not of the power and authority of
the Houses of Parliament in disposing of any person, or judging of any case
which is of single concernment to England: Nor is the Question how the Kings
Person may be disposed of de facto by any one of the Kingdoms; neither is the
Question properly de jure and posse, but de esse, and been esse: And as it is
neither good Logic nor good Divinity to argue a posse ad esse; so sure I am,
in this case it is far worse policy for either Kingdom to dispute what they
may do in the height of their power, when both are consulting what is sit
to be done for the Peace and Security of both. And the relation of both
Kingdoms to his Majesty, and of each Kingdom to other being rightly
considered, as he is King to both, as both are Subjects to him, as both are
engaged in the same Cause, and have been in the same War, and are laboring
under the same Danger, are seeking the same Remedies, and should have the same
Security; we do hold, that the disposing of the Kings Person does not properly
belong to any one of the Kingdoms, but jointly to both. And after Scotland
has suffered the heat of the day and winters cold, have forsaken their own
peace for love of their Brethren, have set their own house on fire to quench
theirs: After so much expense of their blood in all the three Kingdoms, after
we have gone along with you in all the hardship of this War, and (without
vanity be it spoken) have been so useful in this Cause: And that the King has
cast himself into the hands of the Scottish Army, and that by the blessing of
God upon the joint endeavor of both Kingdoms we are come to the harbor of a
peace; We cannot expect, that the honorable Houses will think it agreeable
with conscience or honor, or with the justice of the Houses, that the Person
of the King should be disposed of by them as they shall think fit, or by any
one of the kingdoms alone; but that what ever shall be resolved in this, may be
done by joint advice of both, as may serve most for the peace, security, and
happiness of both Kingdoms.

The Lord Charcellour of Scotland his second Speech: At a Conference in the
Painted Chamber, with a Committee of both Houses, October. 6. 1646.
AT our last meeting in this conference, your Lordships did assert the Vote of
the Houses, That the Person of the King should be disposed on as the two Houses
shall think fit: And we did hold, that the King, who is the Head and Monarch of
both Kingdoms, ought not to be disposed of by any one of the Kingdoms, but by
joint advice of both, as might serve most for the peace, happiness, and
security of his Majesty and both kingdoms, which we fortified with several
arguments from the interests and relations which both Kingdoms have equally to
the King, and from the covenant and treaty between the Kingdoms, as the best
way to preserve our Unity. But since your Lordships do adhere to the Vote of
the Houses, as that which you cannot part from, We do humbly desire, that your
Lordships may be pleased (in time convenient, at the close of this conference)
to report the difference of our judgment to the honorable Houses, who upon
better reasons both may, and (we hope) will take their Vote into further
consideration: And so with reservation of our judgment, that the disposing of
his Majesty's person does belong to both; and not to any one of the Kingdoms,
especially in such a juncture of affairs, as both Kingdoms stand engaged in
this cause; I shall descend particularly how the Kings Person should be
disposed of to the best advantage of both Kingdoms, and for attaining such a
happy peace as all good men should desire. But lest we should walk in the dark
upon obscurity of ambiguous words, I shall desire that the word of disposing of
the Kings person may be rightly understood, and the true sense of it may be
clearly known: For, Dolus versatur in universalibus. For, To dispose of the
Kings person, as both Houses, or both Kingdoms shall think fit, may in some
sense be to depose, or worse: But because the word [Dispose] may admit a more
benign interpretation, as when men commit their estates and children, or that
which is dearest to them to be disposed of, (which is but to be advised) by
these who have nearest relation to them, and in whom they repose most trust: I
shall speak of the disposing of his Majesty's royal person in that sense,
(which I hope) is also the sense of the Houses. Nor do I know any other way how
his Majesty's person can be disposed of, but that he be put either under
restraint, or be at freedom with honor and safety. As for the way of
restraint, I look upon it as it looks upon us, as a remedy more dangerous then
the disease, and as a mean to draw the war of forain Kings upon us (especially
the Prince being in other Kingdoms) rather then to quiet our troubles at home.
And therefore supposing that none of the Kingdoms will take any way concerning
his Majesty's person, but such as may consist with duty and honor, and which
may lessen, and not increase our troubles, I shall lay aside the way of
restraint, and speak of the way which may be with freedom, honor and safety,
which can be no other, but that his Majesty shall go into Scotland, or come to
his Parliament here, or some of his houses near-abouts.

His going into Scotland is full of dangers and inconveniences to both
Kingdoms: The Amalekites are not yet driven out of that I and. The bloody
barbarous Irish, banded with a wicked crew of Malignants, possess the
mountains and highlands, which are the strong holds, and never conquered parts
of that Kingdom. They have not laid down arms, but keep in a body together, and
they are so near Ireland, as the Forces of the Rebels there may in two or three
hours space come over and join with them: and (Scotland) not being able to
keep and entertain Armies long, the King being there, may raise such forces in
Scotland, as may make way quickly into England. And therefore his Majesty's
going into Scotland (before our peace be settled) being of most dangerous
consequence to both Kingdoms, I shall humbly offer to your Lordships
consideration his Majesty's coming to London, or some of his houses
hereabouts, as the most probable way to procure a speedy and happy agreement,
which is also his Majesty's own desire in his Answer to the Propositions. And
although no persuasion of ours could prevail to procure a more satisfactory
answer for the time, then what is returned to the Houses of Parliament, yet (I
assure your Lordships) that the Committee of Estates of the Parliament of
Scotland, and the Noblemen, who were at Newcastle, did faithfully contribute
their best endeavors, that his Majesty might have given his assent to the
Propositions: And, as we did then deliver our minds with that plainness and
freedom which was fit for faithful and loyal Subjects, with no less regard to
this Kingdom, then our own Nation; so are we now (with the same candor and
tenderness of affection) willing and ready to concur with the honorable
Houses in every thing which may promote the great work of Reformation; and
settle Religion according to the Covenant with a well grounded peace. And for
these ends, we desire, that his Majesty's answer may be improved to the best
advantage of the public.

For albeit the King has not given a present assent to the Propositions, yet
he has not in his answer refused them; but does promise, That he will
cheerfully grant and give his assent unto all such Bills (at the desire of the
two Houses) and reasonable demands for Scotland, which shall be really for the
good and peace of his people: To which end he desires and proposes that he
may come to London (or any of his houses thereabouts) upon security, That he
shall be there with honor, freedom, and safety, as the best expedient to
procure a happy agreement between his Majesty and his Parliament, which we
desire may be weighed in the balance of righteous judgment, as a business of
the greatest consequence which can fall within humane consideration, and
wherein the glory of God is most concerned of any business under heaven. For
upon a blessed agreement between the King and his Parliament, Religion and
Righteousness, Truth and Peace, which are the compend and height of all
happiness will be established, to the eternal fame and glory of great
Britain, and the great comfort of all the Protestant churches: And upon our
disagreement, all the calamities of a bloody and unnatural war, will be
continued, and nothing heard nor seen in church nor State but confusion. God
has brought both Kingdoms through the surges and waves of a boisterous
tempest, into the harbor of a peace, and has scattered most part of our
Enemies, and now our work is how to come a-shoare, and establish a right peace.
I hope it is as far from our desires and intentions as it is against our
Covenent and Professions, to change fundamental government. We have need to
take heed that we run not from one extreme into another; Dum stulti vitant
vitia, in contraria currunt: Therefore our study would be how to cure the wound
which our sins and the evil counsels of others have made between the King and
his Parliament to make up the breach, and not make it wider.

It has been universally acknowledged, That the Kings removal from his
Parliament is the immediate and chief cause of all the war, mischief, and
calamities of the kingdoms: Then his Majesty's presence in joining with his
Parliament must be the best, if not the only remedy to remove our traubles,
for it is a maxim no less true then common, that Contraries have Contrary
consequents. Contrari^rum cont^tia sunt c^sequentia


The King desires to come to his Parliament, not only to have his doubts
clecred, and have these difficulties explained which hinder his consent to the
Propositions as they now stand: But likewise that his coming may raise a
mutual confidence between him and his Parliament: If the last were done, the
first would soon be performed, and all those mountains of difficulties would
easily be removed, and become valleys.

Your Commissioners had no power to give any reasons, no not so much as tell
what is the meaning of any of your demands, nor hearken to any desire of the
Kings, And certainly some things might be justly moved by his Majesty, which
are necessary for the Crown and a well grounded Peace, as, That he may have
his Revenues, That he may return with honor and safety to his crown and
government; And if the King were with his Parliament, where he might both give
and receive satisfaction, he might with reason be convinced, to assent to what
he now conceives to be unreasonable.

The making of a peace, is so great and glorious a work, and so acceptable to
all good men, and to the whole people, that it would (after so great trouble)
be like rain to the new mowne grass, or like a resurrection from the dead,
and is a work worthy of a Kings presence: And the King may without arrogance
desire that glory to himself, the more to reingratiate him to his people, and
not devolve that honor wholly to any other, wherein he himself ought to be
the prime Actor. And therefore the Kings presence with his Parliament is the
most probable way to attain to a speedy and blessed peace, which certainly
will be the more durable, if it be with the good liking of both sides.

I know there is one common objection (and I know not another) wherewith many
are possessed and prejudiced against the Kings coming to his Parliament, That his
presence may breed division, and that he may thereafter withdraw and continue
our troubles. Unity and Concord (I confess) is that by which Kingdoms and
Commonwealths do flourish, and there is nothing more dangerous then division,
Concordia enim res parvae cresunt, discordia vero maximae dilabuntur. But is
there any greater or more dangerous division, then to have the Head divided
from the body, go have the King divided from his Parliament, the representative
body of the kingdom, whereof he is the Head? Has not this division divided
brother against brother, the father against the son, and the son against the
father, and Country against country? This division is the cause of all our
other divisions; Take this away and all cur other divisions are at an end.
Ablata causa tollitur effectus. The King does (with all earnestness) desire to
be joined with you, and stands more in need of rec^^ciliation, and I hope will
(according to his profession) endeavor it rather then division; And (I trust)
the wisdom of the honorable Houses is such as they will do so too, and rather
be reconciled to the King, then divide amongst our selves. And that argument,
not to admit of the Kings coming to his Parliament, because his presence may
breed division, is an argument to debar him perpetually from his Parliement
And now the case is altered from what it was, when it was thought unfit, that
the King should come to his Parliament, because then he had forces in the
fields, garrisons and strong holds to return to: Now he has none of these
against you, And his desire of coming to his Parliament, cannot be but with
resolution to agree and stay with you, for if he were once with you, where can
he go from you? And if they were esteemed enemies to the Parliament and the
peace of the kingdoms, who advised the King to withdraw from his Parliament,
what estimation will the world have of them, who will not suffer him to return
to his Parliament, when he offers to cast himself in your arms? Nor can there
be a more real testimony of our respect and affection to England, then that we
desire he may be with you, and be advised by you, neither can you have any
greater honor, then that (after you have dissipated your Enemies) his Majesty
is willing to return to you, And if so kind an offer shall be refused, and the
King driven to despair, it is to be feared, these kingdoms will be involved
in greater difficulties then ever, and we shall be driven out of the harbor and
entrance of a peace, into the tempest of new and bloody wars.

For although Scotland be most willing and desirous that the King should return
to his Parliament with honor, safety, and freedom, and that he may remain
where his personal presence may serve most for the security and happiness of
his people; yet if any such course shall be taken, or any demand made for
rendering of his person, which cannot stand with his honor and safety, or which
cannot consist with our duty, allegiance and Covenant, nor with the honor of
that Army, to whom (in time of his extreme danger) he had his recourse for
safety; it cannot be expected that we can be capable of so base an Act. And if
(to shun this, and avoid occasion of quarrelling between the Kingdoms) he
shall go to Scotland, and resent his expulsion out of England, and crave the
assistance of that kingdom, for recovery of his right to his crown; He may in
a short time raise such Forces in Scotland and Ireland, as with the assistance
of Foraine Princes, these kingdoms may be made a field of blood, and the
youngest amongst us not live to see the end of these unnatural wars. But if
the present opportunity be wisely managed, and that we maintain the just
privileges of Parliament and liberty of the Subject in both kingdoms, with
that wisdom and discretion, as that may be given to God which is Gods, and to
Coesar what is Goesars, if we fear God and the King, and do not meddle with
them who are given to change, That same divine providence and wisdom which
has brought us through many difficulties, will also teach us how to establish
these kingdoms in peace, and the Kings Throne in righteousness, That the
great blessing of a constant and friendly conjunction of the two kingdoms (now
united by allegiance and loyal subjection to one Sovereign and Head) may be
firmly observed and continued to all posterity.

The Lord Chancellor of Scotland his last speech, at a conference in the
Painted chamber, with a Committee of both Houses, October 10.1646.
My Lords and Gentlemen,
THis day I hope will bring our conference to some results to be reported to
the Houses, and therefore I shall frame my Discourse and Arguments with that
succinctnesse as may bring us soonest to a close.

At our first meeting, the subject of our debate was, Whether the Right and
Power of disposing the person of the King, is solely in the two Houses, as they
shall think fit, or in the two Kingdoms; and at our last meeting, we had some
arguing about the same question, but your Lordships did still assert the Vote
of the Houses; and we say (in respect of the interest and relations which both
Kingdoms have equally to the King, especially in the present juncture of
affairs, when both Kingdoms are entered in the same league and covenant, have
jeoparded their lives in the same war, are laboring under the same danger, are
seeking the same remedies, and stand in need of the same peace and security;
and both Kingdoms are bound by our Covenant to preserve Unity, and are obliged
by Treaty that none of us shall make any peace, cessation, or ^greement
whatsoever, without mutual advice and consent of both) That the person ^f the
King cannot be disposed of without the joint advice and consent of both
Kingdoms. But as we do acknowledge that England has parity of interest with
Scotland, so do we still offer that they shall have parity of power in
disposing of the King: and we do affirm, that the person of the King, who is
King of Scotland as well as of England, and is Head and Monarch of both
kingdoms, cannot be disposed of by any one of the kingdoms alone: but what ever
is to be done concerning the dis^osing of his Majesty's person, ought to be
done by joint advice and common consent of both, as may serve most for the
Peace, security, and happiness of the King and Kingdoms, which we did prove
by several Arguments: To which there was nothing answered in effect, but, that
the King being within England, his person was to be disposed of as the two
Houses shall think fit, and that the King being with the Scottish Army, and
they being paid by the Parliament of England, he is in effect in the power of
the Houses, and ought to be at their disposing, in the same way as if he had
come to the army of Sir Thomas Fairfax, or any other of the Parliaments armies.
To which we shall not need to make any reply other then we have made already, I
hat the Kings present residence in England, nor no locality, can take away the
reality of our relations formerly mentioned by us, far less can it take away
the engagements and stipulations between the kingdoms; and though the Scottish
a my be paid by the Parliament of England, yet they are the Army of Scotland,
raised for pursuance of the ends of the Covenant, and are to be ordered and
directed by the Parliaments or committees of both kingdoms: and therefore they
cannot with conscience, duty, nor honor, deliver the person of the King
without his own consent, to be disposed of as the two Houses shall think fit:
but we have declared, and do still declare, that we are content that the person
of the King be disposed of (the word Disposed being taken in a right sense) as
may serve most for the peace, safety, security, honor and happiness of the
King and both kingdoms: and did offer to your Lordships consideration his
Majesty's coming to or near London, as the most probable means to procure a
speedy and well-grounded peace. And seeing your Lordships have done us the
honor to meet with us in this free and brotherly conference, we do expect that
you will concur and assent to this proposition, or propound a better expedient
for the good of both kingdoms. But if the honorable houses will not admit of
this proposition, our next desire is (that it may appear, no lawful and
possible means are left unassayed which may procure a happy agreement betwixt
the King and his Pa^liaments, and for our further exoneration) that
Commissioners may yet once more be sent from both Kingdoms to his Majesty, to
show the meaning of our Propositions and to assert them, and to hear the Kings
doubts, and difficulties, and desires, who may further intimate, that (if his
Majesty shall not give a satisfactory answer to the propositions) then both
Kingdoms will without making any such further application to him, take such
course as they shall judge fittest for the peace and security of the kingdoms.

And as at the opening of this conference, I did begin with an humble, lawful
and laudable desire for unity in relation to Religion, the King, and amongst
our selves; so shall I close in the same dialect. For the first of Religion, if
we do remember our vows to God to perform them, and shall endeavor really,
constantly, and sincerely, the reformation of religion, and uniformity
according to our Covenant, we may certainly expect that God will crown this
great work, wherein he has honored us to be actors with his blessing; but if
in place of uniformity, which we are obliged to endeavor there shall be a
toleration of all sects and sorts of religion, and if we neglect to build the
house of God, and become insolent upon our successes; although we could mount
up with Eagles wings, and build our nests as high as the startes, and had an
army who for valor and strength could march to Constantinople, God shall lay
our glory low in the dust, and suffer the work to fall in our hands, like the
confusion of Babel, And whatever has been moved by us concerning the King, we
desire it may be rightly constructed, as proceeding from such as have not
wavered from their first principles; for when the King was in the height of his
power, we did not, and (I hope) never shall flatter him; and when the enemy was
in the height of their pride and strength, Scotland did fear no colors: and
now when the King is at his lowest ebb, and has cast himself into our army
for safety, we hope your Lordships will pardon us from our sense of honor and
duty to be very tender of the person and posterity of the King, to whom we have
so many near relations, and not like the worse of us: that we cannot so far
forget our allegiance and duty, as not to have an antipathy against the change
of Monarchical government, in which we have lived through the descent of so
many Kings, and under which both kingdoms have been governed so many ages, and
flourished In all happiness. And now my last word shall be for constant unity
between the kingdoms, which as it has been the chief means to promote the
great work wherein both kingdoms are so deeply engaged, so there is nothing can
make us so formidable to our enemies, nor so much aiding one to another, as the
cherishing and continuing thereof; and I dare say that no man would divide the
one from the other, but such as desire to fish in troubled waters, and are
real enemies to both. God has blessed the joint endeavors of both Nations,
both are in one ship, and are come through a very great storm; and now when we
are come into the harbor, it would be great shame to both to split upon the
rocks of division ( and devorato bove deficere in causa) and your Lordships may
be confident that Scotland, who have esteemed no hazard too great for settling
of Religion and love to their Brethren, will stick so fast and firmly to you
(so long as you hold the principles of your Covenant) as no fear nor favor
will ever be able to divide them from you, and we do expect that reciprocal
amity which may perpetuate our unity.

The Lord Chancellor of Scotland his Speech, to the Kings Majesty at Newcastle.
YOur Majesty was pleased on Monday last to call the Lords of your Privy counsel
of Scotland and the Committee, to acquaint them with the Propositions, and
told, that before the delivery of your answer you would make the same known to
them. The time assigned for the stay of the commissioners is so short, and the
conse^uence of your Majesty's answer is of so great importance, either for the
preservation, (...) ruin of your Crown and Kingdoms as we could not be
answerable to God, nor to ^ut trust reposed in us, unless we represent to your
Majesty how necessary it is (as the ^ondition of affairs now stand, and in so
great an extremity) that your Majesty should ^ssent to the Propositions, and
that the danger and loss of your refusal will be re^edilesse, and bring on
sudden ruin and destruction.

I shall begin first with the last, which is the danger, and shall next speak a
word of ^e remedy: The differences between your Majesty and your Parliament
(which no ^an knows better then your Majesty's self) are grown to such a
height, that after any bloody battles, there is no cure but a present peace,
otherwise nothing can be ^pected but certain destruction. The Parliamsent is
possessed of your Navy and of all (...) Forts, garrisons and strong holds of the
kingdom: they have the Excise, assessements, (...) sequestrations at their
disposal, and have authority to raise all the men and money in the ^ingdom, and
(after many victories and great successes) they have a strong Army on ^ot, and
are now in such a posture for strength and power, as they are in a capacity do
what they will, both in Church and State: and some are so afraid, others so
unwil^g to submit themselves to your Majesty's government, as they desire not
you, nor ^y of your race longer to reign over them: Yet the people are so
wearied of the wars, (...) great burdens they groan under, are so desirous of
peace, and loath to have Monar^al government (under which they have lived so
long in peace and plenty) changed; a such as are unwearied of your Majesty's
government, dare not attempt to cast it ^lly off, till once they send
Propositions of peace to your Majesty, lest the people without whose
concurrence they are not able to carry on their design) should fall ^m them.
And therefore all the people being desirous that (after so great wars and
^ubles) they may have a perfect security from oppression and arbitrary power,
the ^uses of Parliament have resolved upon the Propositions which are tendered
to your ^jesty, as that without which the Kingdom and your people cannot be in
safety, (...) most part of the people think, that there cannot be a firm peace
upon any other ^mes. Your Majesty's friends, and the commissioners from
Scotland, (after all the ^stling we could,) were forced to consent to the
sending those Propositions, or to ^ated as the hinderers of peace, and to send
no Propositions at all. And now Sir, if (...) Majesty (which God forbid) shall
refuse to assent to the Propositions, you will ^all your friends, lose the
City, and all the country, and all England will join ^nst you as one man, and
(when al hope of reconciliation is past) it is to be feared will process and
depose you, and set up another Government; they will charge (...) deliver your
Majesty to them, and to render the Northern garrisons, and to re^e our Army out
of England: and upon your Majesty's refusing of the Propositions, (...)
Kingdoms will be constrained for their mutual safety, to agree and settle
Religi^ (...)nd Peace without you, which (to our unspeakable grief) will ruin
your Majesty your posterity: and if your Majesty reject our faithful advice,
(who desire no^g on earth more then the establishmrnt of your Majesty's
throne,) and lose Eng(...) by your wilfulnes, your Majesty will not be permitted
to come and ruin Scotland. (...), We have laid our hand upon our hearts, we
have asked counsel and direction (...) God, and have had our most serious
thoughts about the Remedy, but can find ^her (as affairs stand for the present)
to save your Crown and Kingdoms, then Majesty's assenting to the Propositions.
We dare not say, but they are higher in some things (if it were in our power
and option to remedy it) then we do approve of; but when we see no other means
for curing the distempers of the Kingdoms, and closing the breaches between
your Majesty and your Parliament: Our most humble and faithful advice is, that
your Majesty would be graciously pleased to assen^ to them, as the only best
way to procure a speedy and happy peace; because your Majesty shall thereby
have many great advantages, You will be received again in you^ Parliament with
the applause and acclamations of your People; by your Royal presence your
friends will be strengthened, Your enemies (who fears nothing so much as the
granting the Propositions) will be weakened, your Majesty will have a fit
opportunity to offer such Propositions as you shall in your wisdom judg^ fit
for the Crown and Kingdom; all Armies will be disbanded, and you^ people
finding the sweet fruits of your peaceable Government, your Majesty will gain
their hearts and affections, which will be your strength and glory, and will
recover all that your Majesty has lost in this time of tempest and trouble.

And if it please God so to incline your Royal heart to this advice of your
humb^ and faithful servants, who (next to the honor of God) esteem nothing
more prec^ous then the safety of your person and crown, Our actions shall
quickly make appear to all the world, That we esteem no hazard too great for
your Majesty's sa^^ty, and that we are willing to sacrifice our lives and
fortunes for establishing your Throne.

And now, Sir, we prostrate our selves at your Majesty's feet, and in the
lowest p^sture of humility do beg, That your Majesty may (in end) grant the
suit of your (...) humble servants and faithful subjects who have no private
aims, but only the g^ry of God, and safety of your Majesty's person,
posterity, and crown before (...) eyes. And the granting of our desires will
revive our fainting spirits: refresh our hearts, which are overwhelmed, and
like to break with sorrow, and will turn prayers and tears of the many
thousands of your people, in praises to God and m^ them embrace your Majesty
with acclamations of joy.

FINIS.
