To the Right Honorable EDWARD, Earl of Clarendon, and Lord High Chancellar of
ENGLAND, etc.
MY LORD,
THere is no man read's Your great name in the Front of this book, but will be
ready to enquire in himself, what interest Your Lordship can have in it; I
could satisfy them with the common language of Dedications, and say, that
those noble and high Favors, I have received by Your Lordships kindness, make
me endeavor, what I can, to acknowledge them, with all humility and gratitude;
but these are particular duties, the obligation of them always does, and will
lie upon me, to the utmost of my power. This Treatise is of public
concernment; it handle's the highest and greatest business of Church and State
that, since the plantation of Christian Religion in England, ever any man had
need to write of, and by that Title it is Yours.

My Lord, I know, and whosoever shall have the happiness to write the story of
these times, as he ought, must record it, to Your perpetual honor that those
most glorious and blessed alterations, which this present age enjoy's, both in
Ecclesiastic and Politic concernments, have, in a great part, resulted out of
Your presence, and assistance, to our sacred Sovereign, in those intricacies of
affairs, with which He, and, in Him, We were all involved; My Lord, I know
that most addresses to him, in his accursed exile, were by Your hands
transferred to His; the returns again were, for the most part through the same
conduct; so that, if there had been flaw or chink in Your Lordship's secrecy,
to let out what was committed to Your trust; or defect of prudence in directing
what was returned, I have often thought with my self, there would scarce have
been a subject faithful and trusted by the King, who could have supervived his
Restoration, to congratulate this blessed morning of happiness, which we now
enjoy; and therefore most of those gallant persons may acknowledge the
preservation of their lives to those great and Counsellour-vertues, (as I may
term them, such as most highly adorn a Counselor of state) with which Your
Lordship was endued, I am sure (though unworthy those Epithetes) I can affirm
it of my self and mine own being.

This is the reason why this Treatise creep's under, and expect's Your
Lordships protection; It handle's the Fundamental articles of all those things
which hitherto you, and all virtuous men, have endeavored to preserve, and for
which you and they have suffered so much hardship: for when this unhappy Author
slight's those reasons, which have been brought, to defend the eternal
infinite being of a God, this Book has justified it against him; O my Lord; it
is that God which has untwisted and unravelled those many misfortunes with
which you were lately entangled, and has exalted you to a high place of
Dignity, wherein you may serve him; as then you have always kept your
integrity to him, through many dangers for defense of his glory; ^o, I am
confident, the memory and honor of him must always be precious in your sight
hereafter.

When he has most unworthily disgraced our hope of Heaven, this Treatise has
labored to vindicate that by reason: my Lord, I know, you have always thought
those eternal joys are of an unmeasurable condition, excelling these temporal,
and therefore your duty and thankfulness to that God, who has provided such
blessings for you, w^ll assist me to suppress all wicked thoughts and
suggestions of false reasons, which may any way disturb the blessed assurance
of that glorious expectation.

When this Author has spoken very dangerously of the blessed Trinity, this
Treatise has, by reason, as well as Scripture, endeavored to justify it. My
Lord does know how, without the divinity of our Savior, there can be no
salvation for man; the arm of man only could not compass it; our thought of a
God, our hope of heaven, were in vain, without it: the blessed Trinity joyn's
in the productions of these divine effects, which we enjoy; Your Lordship
therefore will perfect these noble duties toward God, which in such a high
measure you have already expressed in protecting such a sacred truth from the
blasting of malicious wits.

These things (my Lord) I dedicate to Your Lordship as to a person of great,
and eminent, honor, and worth; besides these there are in this book the
vindication of diverse truths, which reflect upon you, as the highest dispenser
of justice in our Nation, under our Sovereign; He has abused the nature of
justice, of meum and tuum, and let the world out to a dissolute confusion; of
which, although I have much more to say hereafter, yet here are delivered many
things which may vindicate the anciently-received conclusions from those
violences which he has offered to them; so then, as to a great Patron of
Virtue, of Religion, of Justice, these Papers are submitted to your protection;
how the particulars are handled by the Author, will be your wisdom to judge;
howsoever, since it is the child of my brain, the fruit of my studies, and so
one of the dearest things in the world to me, I most humbly beseech you accept
this present from him who would make you a nobler, if he could, and acknowledge
me to be,

MY LORD, Your Lordships most real honourer, and hearty Servant WILL. St.
David's

TO THE CHRISTIAN READER.
REader, I entreat you, take notice, that long since, in a sullen retirement,
being amazed at the transactions of businesses in the Church, so well as State.
I not only grieved to observe the ruins of that glorious hedge, with which God
had fenced his Vineyard, (that hedge of thorns, which formerly no man could
have kicked against, but it would have hurt his foot) broken down; but likewise
how the foxes had been in the Vineyard; how they had eaten up and devoured most
of those desirable fruits of piety, humility, obedience, and fidelity, which
had only a name of honor left them by former writers, but no existence in the
practice of men amongst us; Considering these sad misfortunes, and studying
what would become of them, I found many gallant men, with noble and heroique
spirits, repairing the hedge, by showing the necessity of that discipline whose
decay introduced all those mischiefs to the Church; others, with as high a
virtue, and as effectual pens, pruning the Vines, and cherishing those decayed
fruits; I honored their endeavors, but considered cui bono, to what purpose
all this learning bestowed; not only the foxes have been nibling the fruits and
branches, but the wild Bore has been in the Vineyard, and has so far dug
at the roots of Religion, that the principal Vines hang by little strings, and
do only live, yea would die if not succored. (These were my reflections on
those times) I therefore thought it necessary for some body, and applied my
particular endeavors to cast fresh Earth about those roots of Religion; to
chase, if I could, that wild Bore out of the Vineyard into his former Forest of
heathenish principles; and surely if any one man, for some hundreds of years,
might be called that Bore, it is Mr. Hobbes, no one man ever writing so
destructively to the principles of Christianity as he has done; Upon this
reason I bent my study against him and his Books, and did heretofore publish
two pieces in an unknown name, being willing to have the business done, but
not caring if my name were lost in the World; the first was merely
Philosophical, against the two first Chapters of his Leviathan, which yet,
because he made that the Introduction and Foundation of his Divinity, I thought
it necessarily conducing to my intentions against the other, to begin with;
Since my writing that I have found some men, of great worth, and deserved
reputation in Letters, that have opined with some things in that piece, upon
which I thought to have suspended my putting it out again, until I had
enlarged my Discourse with them; but, upon perusal, supposing they could not
prophecy, nor had foreseen by reason what I urged, I resolved to publish it as
it is, and take some other leisure to censure them, if God give me life. The
other piece was against the 12th. 13th. and 14th. Chapter; both so falsely
printed, that, when I saw them, I could scarce know them for mine own. I have
writ against most part of his great errors, but my condition in those times
was such that I was forced, upon frequent and sudain searches of inquisitive
soldiers, to huddle up my papers, and throw them I know not where, nor can yet
find diverse of them; those which I can find at this present, I now print,
considering how lamely such duties are performed by Executors, and my self
grown to that Age as I must commit most things to them shortly, how soon I know
not; the rest, God willing, shall come out as I shall discover them, or else
can repair what is defective by my memory, at such snatches of time as I can
recover from my necessary duties, who love not my life, nor any piece of it,
but as it shall conduce to the glory of God, and the good of Christian men,
that they may lead a peaceable and godly life in unity and charity, which is
the whole endeavor of

Your brother and servant in and for Jesus Christ, Will: Lucy Bishop of St.
David's.

I. Whether the subject, wherein color is, be the object of sight. Color and
Image not the same, nor in the same. 8 II. His instance of the Sun's appearance
by reflection censured. ibid. III. Whence it is, that we see the same object
double. ibid. Color is in the Object; Image or species not; 9
IV. Where it is by reflection. Mr. Hobbes's fallacy between that and color.
10
CHAP. III.
I. His tedious proposition. ibid. II. Image what. 11 The apparition of the
Object, not of the Brain, much less of Motion. ibid.
III. As is also Color. 12 IV. Mr. Hobbes's inconstancy in the production and
seat of sense. ibid. V. Sparks, appearing after a stroke upon the eye, not
from any concussion of the brain; 13 Not from the optic nerve, but rather from
the White or Crystalline humor. ibid. The like from a white Cat or white
Napkin struck in the dark. ibid. Which may be only the strong emission of
species. 14 The great Axiom upon which Philosophy, if not Divinity, is
founded. ibid.
VI. Mr. Hobbes illogicall in his proofs; ibid. He playe's the Mahomet in
arguing. 15
VII. No Image of Light, 16 VIII. But as incorporated into some body. 17 IX.
The apparition of Light, such as Mr. Hobbes's would make, prove's not Image and
Color to be the apparitions of Motion. 18 X. Fire move's rather upward, then
equally every way; ibid. XI. Not presently extinguished, when enclosed, and
how, when it is. 19 XII. The motion of Fire what; It has no positive
contraction; 20 XIII. No rejection of the contiguous Medium. 21 An Instance in
two fired Beacons. ibid.
XIV. The apparition of Fire, after a stroke, is not by any rebound from the

VII. Heat is neither pleasure, nor pain, but a cause of both. 46 VIII. The
same cause works different effects, according to the subject or object about
which it is busied. 47 Some danger in asserting sensible qualities to be
nothing but mere apparitions. 48

according to God's method, with an innate appetite to accompl^sh his end,
though without knowledge how they tend to it. 61
CHAP. IX.
I. How standing Water put in motion recovereth rest; 63 II. How improperly
Dreams are assimilated to it when ceasing. 64 III. Imagination something more
then decaying sense; ibid. IV. Memory no decaying sense, the act of Sensation

The opinion of Ghosts could not introduce the assurance that There is a God.
ibid. III. Ignorance of second causes apter to produce Atheism then Religion.
86 IV. Devotion to what we fear rather a fruit then seed of Religion. 87 V. A
taking things casual for Prognostics, no seed of the false Religions. 8^ There
have been Sibylls that prophesied of our Savior. 90

CHAP. XIV.
I. The sole immediate seed of Religion an innate principle. 91 II. To be
proved from the chain of Causes. 92 An eternity of the World, with an infinity
of causations, why not to be admitted. ibid.
III. Somewhat of God, though infinite, may be known; 94 IV. And that from
Phantasms. 95 V. The conceit of finite and infinite explained; 96 What conceit
may be had of infinite. 98
VI. An Eternity acknowledged by all of different opinions. 99 VII. Mr.
Hobbes's indifference be the world finite or infinite. 101 VIII. His
contradiction touching the first mover. ibid. The first mover proved

applicable. 108 XIII. The doctrine of Eternity most agreeable to H. Scripture.

in the creatures, as all ignorance is inexcusa^le; ibid. The Bishop's character
of Mr. Hobbes; 117 And censure of his Dispute here touching the eternity of the
world; ibid. And of the apology he is likely to make, out of such principles,
at the last day. 118 His Lordship's seasonable and salutary advice to him. 119
Mr. Hobbes pretend's to be content with the doctrine of holy Scripture, the
fame of Miracles, Country-custome and Laws, yet wrangle's against all. ibid.

CHAP. XV.
I. Mr. Hobbes contradict's himself, as touching the seeds of Religion; 121

the end of every Psalm, etc. 127 Invocation Genesis 4.26. not improbably taken for
some peculiar Devotion introduced in Enos's time. 128
III. The second argument for idolatry before the Flood answered. ibid. The
punishment in this world many times disproportionate to the sin. ibid. Of what
sort their sins were, who perished in the Flood. 129
IV. Revelation, not Reason, did dictate the first Religion. ibid. V. The
difference betwixt the occasion and foundation of Religion. 130 Which
prevails according to the congruity it has to the will of God; ibid.
Whatsoever men's opinion be of the Person that introduces it. 131
VI. How this difference is consistent with the other of assurance that there
is a God. 132 Why the promised discourse of the Jewish and Christian Religion
is omitted. ibid.

CHAP. XVII.
I. Mr. Hobbes abstruse in making out his Conclusion of suspected Governors
and their Religion. 133 II. Christian Religion depend's not upon the integrity
and sufficiency of Church governors. 134 III. Religion, formed by divine
Revelations, may oblige to a belief of seeming contradictions. 135 IV. The
singular excellency of Faith, to be as well against, as above, Reason. 136 V.

Men universally no such opiniatours of their own prudence, as Mr. Hobbes
pretends. 141

Fears work upon us. 144 Not Ahab's, but Jezebel's malice destroyed Naboth. 145
Objection answered. ibid. The title of Occupancy sacred, etc. ibid. Reason
secureth men from fears; ibid. Who apprehend no danger from any bare
possibility of injury, 146 Which is generally restrained by the thoughts of
God's punitive Justice. ibid. How Reason or Arms decide the controversy before
occupancy. 147

oblige to mutual friendship. ibid. Objection about St. Paul's entertainment in
Malita answered. 149
III. Time being no essential, constitute's no war. ibid. IV. Mr. Hobbes's
instance in foul weather, to illustrate, erroneous. 150 V. A disposition to

families not at war with the Kings and Nations among whom they live. ibid. The
concord of which has a better dependence then upon lust. ibid.
V. The exorbitances of a Civil war prove not men to be in a polemical state by
nature. ibid. VI. The mutual jealousies of Sovereigns render them not like
Gladiatours, in a direct posture of war. 157 VII. Conscience dictate's to men
what is right and wrong: what Law and common Power they must submit to. 158
VIII. Military Valor and Prudence, degenerated into Force and Fraud, lose the
nature, and deserve not the name, of the two Cardinal Virtues in war. 159 IX.
Justice and Injustice no faculties, but habits, and may be in a military
person. 160 X. Nations have propriety in Dominions. 161 Persons in their wives.

XI. Their title to which may be various. 163 That of Occupancy most evident.
ibid.

CHAP. XXII.
I. The right of Nature extend's farther then to the preservation of life. 164
II. Several acceptions of Necessity, and the different effects of it
accordingly; 165 Nothing Necessary that God has not provided for by some Law.

his life; 166 IV. It being not in nature the principal of man's happiness.
ibid. V. Nor the power lost with it considerable in respect of the spiritual
activity and perfection gained by Death; 167 VI. Which is not so terrible, and
painful, as pretended. 168 Ancient instances; 169 The most signal that of Otho
and his soldiers. ibid. Cato's double attempt to dispatch himself. 170 Arria's
magnanimity in being a like precedent to her husband Paetus. 171 A modern
instance in a young child. 172

and Sister. ibid. A young child mistook one for the other. 173
Mis-representations make it otherwise apprehended. ibid.

CHAP. XXIII.
I. He that has right to the end, has not right to all means whatsoever in
the attaining that end; 176 The ultimate end excepted. ibid.
II. He that judges by the right of Nature has a Law of Nature to limit and
regulate him in that judgment. 177 To which he is obliged by Reason. ibid.
III. When the Law of Nature for preservation may be dispensed with; 178 As the
right for a man's preserving some piece of his estate. ibid.
IV. Mr. Hobbes mistaken in his definition of Right, and division of it from
Law. 179 V. What right is properly, and what wrong. 180 Whence is proved the
consistence of Right with Law. ibid.

CHAP. XXIV.
I. What is the Law, what the Right of Nature. 181 Man, in his most peculiar
dominion, subject and tributary to God. ibid.
II. Man in his first Charter had dominion given him over the creatures, but
not over other men. 182 Man's will not to be the rule of his judgment, nor the
reason of of his actions. 183
III. Why men are exempt from God's general Charter of dominion at Man's
creation; ibid. To put a restraint on any Vice which had no positive Law
against it; ibid. As the sin of Sodom, it may reasonably be supposed, had none.
184 How Mr. Hobbes would have out- Cained Cain in the justification of
Fratricide. ibid. The contradiction in mutual dominion, every man over every
man. 185
IV. No new Patent made to Noah, but that to Adam re-enforced. ibid. Noah's
Sons like co-heires or in^er-commoners in their right. 186 They had not the
world divided among them by consent, but by casual occupancy, or choice, as
every of them thought fit. 187
V. An Objection answered. ibid. The Children of Israel d^spossessed the
Canaanites by God's prerogative which he had revealed. ibid. The first
generation of men understood their titles of propriety without God's peremptory
command. 188
VI. Jus and Utile not the same thing. ibid. Places, etc. not appropriated,
become duly his that first seizes. 189 How Tully understood Utile far
otherwise then Mr. Hobbes. ibid. Mr. Hobbes's Argument ex non concessis. ibid.

CHAP. XXV.
I. The right of nature not such as Mr. Hobbes define's it; 190 II. Not
liberty, as he describe's it. 191 External impediments may hinder, but not
take away, natural power. ibid.
III. Exceptions against Mr. Hobbes's definition of the Law of Nature. 192 A
vein of errors that run through his Book. 193
IV. Mr. Hobbes may be allowed to say, he declare's, when he prove's nothing;
but not to suppose a multitude of falsehoods to make the horridness of one
Conclusion. ibid. A term wanting to Mr. Hobbes's just engagement in a War; 194
V. And to him a remembrance of his own principles. 195 War not the only
preservative of Man's right or Nature's; ibid. The discourse of Man's laying
down his right to all things, etc. unnecessary. ibid.
VI. That is not always really good for which a man part's with his right. 196
A man may lay down his right to resistance, and preservation of his life for a
greater good. 197 Objection answered. ibid. Tertullian's signal instance in the
Christians of his time. ibid.
VII. He may suffer imprisonment, etc. without reluctance, for the same reason;

somewhat from all eternity, or being idle, which could not be. 401
VII. Vasques charge Lully with a mistake of a formal cause for an efficient;
who is mistaken by him. 402 And the cause proved no less efficient then formal.

plurality of persons by production. 404 The Objection, urging that Angels
cannot produce the like effect, answered. 405

Observations, Censures and Confutations, Of diverse Errors in MR. HOBBES HIS
LEVIATHAN: Chap. 1. and Chap. 2. Of Humane Nature.
CHAP. I
Of Sense, its cause, etc. particularly of Sight.

Sect. 1.
I Let pass his Introduction, although very obnoxious to censure, and, first
encounter his first Chapter, which seems to be the foundation of what follows,
but how unfit to support such a heavy building, will appear in the examining.
The Title of this Chapter is Of Sense, and he begins with a definition of the
thoughts of Man single, which he says ( are, every one, representation, or
appearance, of some quality, or other accident, of a body without us called an
Object. A man's thought something more then representation.
) In this observe his first mistake, that he makes a man's thought nothing but a
representation, and he brings no proof for what he affirms, nor answers such
obj^ctions as are brought by Philosophers against it; but, as if his Book were
writ by him for the Novices of Pythagoras, and his authority were enough, he
would have it swallowed without chewing; but that this is true in no thoughts
of men, whether intellectual, or sensual, is most apparent to him who shall
consider, that when a man sleeps, or indeed is attent upon other business
waking, although both visible and audible objects are presented to him, yet he
thinks not of them, nor discerns them; so that a man's thought is more then a
representation. And to him who shall answer, that this is for lack of
attention, I object, he confutes himself, for then thought is not only a
representation, but something more, a cogitation of that man, which is an act
of the soul; and certainly, as he himself phraseth it, the thought of man is an
act of man's, but this representation is an act merely of the object, and
therefore cannot be the thought of man: It is true, that in every thought of
man there is something appearing, but man's thought is not that apparition, but
the apprehension of that appearance, and some way or other some judgment of it;
the original or first thought is sense, concerning which, he consents with the
stream of Philosophers, that nihil in intellectu quod non prius fuit in sensu,
one way or other. But here he cites another Book, where he has written more at
large of this matter; I shall apply my self to both, that is named Humane
Nature, or the Fundamental Elements of Policy, chap. 2. But because I find some
things in one, which are not in the other, errors enough in both, I shall
treat of them apart, and first of this piece of Leviathan.

Sect. 2.
Here first he undertakes to set down the cause of Sense, as if it had but one
(as indeed, by his Philosophy, Pressure of the heart, or brain, made by the
external object, not the true cause of sense.
it might seem to have) this cause he makes to be the external object, which
presses the Organ, proper to each sense, etc. this pressure he follows to the
brain and heart, (I wonder which way from the eye, or ear, it gets to the
heart,) there this pressure caused a resistance, or counter-passion, or
endeavor of the heart to deliver it self, (mark now, the brain, which
doubtless is the fountain of sense, is left out) which endeavor, because
outward, seems to be some matter without; consider the strange uncouthness of
this language; if there be such an endeavor which universally cannot be true,
yet this endeavor is inward, although that which presses it be put out; like
a man who thrusts another out of doors, that endeavor to thrust him out is
within, although the man be thrust out, all his endeavor must be within,
unless he follow him out of doors, which I think he will not affirm of the
brain, or heart. Secondly, consider that it is impossible that the heart, or
brain, should be so displeased with all apparitions, although they press them,
as to endeavor to be delivered of them; for there are some things of this
nature, as sweet Music, Taste, Beauties in visible objects, in all senses some
objects so grateful to the Organ, yea, heart, or brain, yea all, that they
cannot choose but delight in them, yea hug and embrace them with all kindness;
if so, why should they endeavor to expel them? yes, (he may say) because they
press them: I ask, how do the brain or heart discern that pressure? All
discerning is either by sense or understanding, no understanding before sense,
it must therefore be discerned by sense, and then sense must be before there be
any sense, for he makes sense not to be, until that which pressed be thrown
out: These are unheard of discourses amongst Philosophers; but his opinions do
confute that saying, Nihil dictum quod non fuit dictum prius; and therefore I
must be excused for producing new objections to such opinions; consider then
that last clause of the former sentence, ( which endeavor, being outward,
seems to be some matter without) First, I have showed the endeavor must be
inward; next, let us consider how this endeavor can appear to be somewhat
without; according to him, this endeavor expelled that which pressed the brain
or heart, but which way can this endeavor look like some matter without? I am
confident that neither any other, nor he himself understands what he writ, but
he would write somewhat to amuse a Reader; if he had said, the expelled
Species, or I know not what he calls it, that which pressed did seem to be some
matter without, it had looked like reason, although but like it; but to say, the
endeavor did seem to be some matter without, was a strange kind of
unreasonable speech; but he goes on, and I mean to follow him close.

Sect. 3.
Not seeming, but some action, must be sense.
( And (says he) this seeming or fancy is that which we call sense, and
consists, as to the eye, in light or color, etc.) this seeming, to what does
it seem? that which seems, seems to somewhat, either the soul, or the powers of
the soul, the organs, or heart, or brain; now if it seem so to any Agent
whatsoever, that act on which apprehends this seeming, must be the sense, not
the seeming it self: ( This seeming (says he) to the eye, Sight consists not
in light or color figured.
consists in light or color figured,) if so, then, say I, it is true, that
light or color, figured, is sight; for when we say, a thing consists in any
thing, we mean to express its nature; but to say, that sight is light, or
color figured; or that light and color figured, is sight, is as much as ^o
say, the understanding is a horse; or a horse the understanding; or
understanding consists in a horse, because it is busied about it: It is true,
understanding of a horse, does require the being of a horse, or else it could
not understand it; and sight does require light, or color figured, but it
cannot be said to consist in it, but as an object. He proceeds [ All qualities,
called sensible, are in the object, that causes them, but so many several
motions of the matter by which it presses our Organs diversely.] I will let
pass this, because I shall have full occasion to speak of it in the second
part, concerning his Element of Policy: He goes on, ( neither in us are they
any thing but diverse motions (for motion produces nothing but motion) but
their appearance to us is fancy, the same waking or dreaming.)

Here is an Aphorism (as if it were undeniable) but without any proof or
reason of it to be received by the Reader, without examining for his authority;
Motion begets somewhat beside motion.
the Axiom is; That motion begets nothing but motion; a speech far from all
truth in Philosophy; for were it not that there is an aim at quiet, there would
scarce be any motion, Finis belli Pax, the end to which, and the end for which
it is; but to say, it produces nothing but motion, is against all the
experience in the world; for although in some, and most motions, it may be
said, that the effect is not produced by the power of the motion, but the
virtue of that Agent which operates by motion, and whose instrument that motion
is; yet that way that motion does produce any thing, all things are produced by
motion, Substances, Men, Beasts, Trees, Accidents, Colors, Quantities, Places,
all whatsoever; but all these things are not motions, yea, this last, which is
Place, and in which motions, and the effects of motions, are most sensibly
discovered, is so far from being motion, that in our sublunary places there can
be no motion in them, but only motions to them; nor can they themselves be
locally moved, for the place of every thing is the Ambient Superficies: Now
that, with us, is either of Air or Water, and if a man stir in any place, he
acquires a new place, and alters the old, so that in that place he stirs not,
and you cannot remove the Ambient Air or Water, but it alters his condition;
so that unless he conceive that all things are motion, it cannot be true, that
motion begets nothing but motion, for motion produces all sublunary things.
When he writ his Leviathan, there was motion, but this Leviathan, I hope, is
not motion; it may, perhaps, in needless Readers, cause motion and commotion,
but certainly it lies still under my paper at this time, and will do all this
night. This is the strangest Proposition that ever was obtruded upon men, but I
desist from it at this instant, perhaps to enlarge hereafter, although I think
this abundantly enough. Where he adds, that their appearance to us is fancy, I
deny it, but that act which discerns the appearance, may in some sense be
called fancy, I grant. What he adds afterward, Philosophy Schools, and
Universities, how necessary to Christendom.
concerning the pressure of the eye, etc. I refer to another place, but mean
not to lose it. At the latter end he censures all the Philosophy Schools
throughout Christendom, but he is not so severe against them, as to wish them
an utter extirpation; he will hereafter reserve a room and office for them in
the Commonwealth; but he lets us see, by the way, what things (when he is made
Visitor General of all Christendom) would be amended. In the mean time I shall
show this use of Universities, that there may be always a certain company of
learned men in all Professions, by whom, as by a Standard, all dangerous
Doctrines may be tried, whether they be Orthodox, or useful to the
Commonwealth, or no; which censure I am confident his Leviathan will never
abide. And now I will examine this same business of Sense, as it is set down
more at large in the second Chapter of his Humane Nature; Chapter 2. censures
the 2. Chapter of Humane Nature.

CHAP. II.
Concerning the object of Sight, Color, Image or Species, etc.

Sect. 1.
UPon which my first observation is, that although in the head, or contents, of
this Chapter, there is put the definition of sense to the 2. number; yet in
that 2. number, nor elsewhere in that Chapter, is there any definition of
Sense; but in that number, only some little discourse of the outward cause of
Sense wrought by the object; which is most illogically done, and, for lack of
defining, he disputes most perplexedly every where. I will not trouble the
Reader with censuring every line, but because that which is material in this
Chapter consists in four propositions, which he undertakes to prove, I will
content my self with an enquiry into them.

Whether the subject, wherein color is, be to be the object.
1. The first is, that the subject wherein color and Image are inherent, is not
the object of things seen. This he proves, because numb. 5. ( every man has so
much experience, as to have seen the Sun, or other visible objects, by
reflection in the water, and the Glasses; and this alone is sufficient for this
conclusion, that color and Image may be there where the thing seen is not.) I
stop here, and will first examine the proposition it self, which is proposed
with much deceit, for he says, The subject wherein color and Image are
inherent, is not the object. He should have proved first, that color and Image
are the same, which he knows is denied by all his adversaries; color is in the
object of Sight, but there is no need of the Image, where the substance is, nor
can the Image of color be in the same subject with the color.

Sect. 2.
This uniting such things, as are in their nature distinct, breeds a mighty
confusion in the discourse, and so dazzles a weak sight, that it can hardly
discern betwixt them. Color is in the object.
I say then, that color is in the object, but Image is not. Next I come to his
proof, the appearance of the Sun by reflection, by which he would have proved,
that color and Image are not in the object: but it does not prove that the
color is not in the object, but only the Image, for the color remains in the
object, when the Image and likeness is gone abroad.

Sect. 3.
But he urges again, that diverse times men see the same object double, Whence
it is that we s^e the same ^bject d^uble.
as two candles for one, which may happen by distemper, or otherwise without
distemper, if a man will, the organs being either in their right temper, or
equally distempered. Not to trouble the Reader with my transcribing all, I
answer to this, that this double sight may be two ways, either by a distemper
of the Organ, or by a false reflection in the medium. The first I have had, and
have been cured by Physic; The second is easy, for there may be multiplying
glasses, and many such instruments, which many deliver the species double, and
then the color, or object, must appear such: but here is no reason to prove,
that the color is not in the object, because Quicquid recipitur, recipitur ad
modum recipientis; if the eye be indisposed, it must needs follow, that the
species shall be qualified accordingly; And for the medium, or middle place, or
mean, which transports the species ^o the eye, it must needs be, that the
liquor will taste of that tap out of which it runs; that every story is
enlarged or lessened, multiplied or diminished, according to the affection or
disposition of the deliverer, and so the indisposition of the medium varying
the species, it must needs be, that the color must appear such, although it be
other; but he proves his conclusion thus [ one of these Images therefore is not
inherent in the object] See here the fallacy put in his proposition at the
first, The Image or Species not in the object.
Confounding color, and the Image of it: It is true, the Image, or species
(for I will maintain that word) is not in the object, but the color is; and
where he says, one is not in the object, I say neither is, but the color of
which that is an Image, which he in this place does labor to infringe; and
therefore as his Proposition was fallacious, so his proof is vain. And I think
I have said enough to this Proposition.

Sect. 4.
His second is, That there is nothing without us (really) which we call an
Image, or color. Where it is by reflection.
This Proposition is short, and his proof as short, thus numb. 6 Secondly, that
the Image of any thing by reflection in glass, or water, or the like, is not
any thing in or behind the Glass, or in or under the water, every man may grant
to himself, which is the second Proposition. Here you may observe how the
former fallacy runs through the whole discourse. His Proposition was, that
there was nothing without us, which we call Image or color: In his proof he
disputes only of Images by reflection, not at all of colors; so that, were his
argument true, yet it proved not his conclusion, because it proves not, Mr.
Hobbs's fallacy.
that colors are not without us; but his argument is false, his antecedent as
well as consequence; the Image is in the Glass, as appears, for else from the
Glass it could not be multiplied to the eye; the Image is there, but the color
is the object; the Image is first in the glass, and from the glass, by removing
or multiplying it self, it comes to the eye; and what he says will be granted,
is impossible for him that has eyes, and sees the Image there.

CHAP. III.
Image and Color what: The effect of violent strokes upon the eye: The
apparition of Light, motion of Fire, working of the Sun, etc.

Sect. 1.
HIs third proposition is, (that the said image or color is but an apparition
unto us of the motion, agitation, or alteration, which the object works in
the brain or spirit, or some internal substance of the head.) Here is a tedious
Proposition, and there is a tedious proof of it; to avoid confusion therefore,
I will take this proposition into some pieces, and examine them apart, and then
overthrow his proof.

Sect. 2.
First, I observe the old fallacy, Image or color, Image what.
both put as one, and the same, but it is false in both, to say that either of
them is but an apparition unto us of the motion, which the object works in
the brain. First for Image, etc. All Images certainly are the apparitions of
those things whose Images they are, the Image of a horse, is the apparition of
a horse, for they are the apparitions of such things as they make appear, and
they make these things, and these things only appear, whose Images they are:
Now these visible species make red and green colored things appear, to wit,
the object, not the motion of the brain; which without doubt can have none of
these colors.

For although it is possible to be conceived, The apparition of the object, not
of the motion.
that from these Images, conveyed to the brain, the brain may receive some
likeness of the object, yet that likeness represents, and is the apparition
of the object, not the brain. But then to say, it is the apparition of this
motion, is ridiculous; it is true, motion, because a thing known, has it is
apparitions, it could not be known else, but that is a distinct apparition; as
the nature of motion is distinct from other things, so must its apparition be;
but to say that all these Images are apparitions of motions, is as much as if
he should say, that the apparition of any thing which is quiet, and does not
move, were the apparition of a motion; yea the conceit which a man has of
rest it self, which is incompetible with motion, should be the apparition of
it is clean contrary, which is motion, and the conceit of the brain being
quiet should be the conceit of the brains motion, then which nothing can be
more abhorring both to sense and reason.

Sect. 3.
As is also Color.
And then in the next place, color is not an apparition of the motion, etc.
which the object works in the brain, etc. His very phrase confutes it, for
color is the object, now if it be the object, it is not an apparition of the
mo^ion which the object works. Again, color is a permanent thing, an
apparition of a motion is transient, as the motion is, and that motion he names
is of little or no stay at all, most sudden. Again, if it be an apparition of
such a motion, how came that motion to be green, yellow, blew? etc. either it
has it originally from it self, and then that motion has color in it; or
else it has it from the mover, which is the object, then how could the object
make it of any color, when by this Gentleman, it has none? It cannot be
therefore as he says, that either color or Image can be the apparition unto
us of the motion which the object works.

Sect. 4.
Mr. Hobbes's Philosophy unconstant.
Secondly, observe how unconstant this gentleman's Philosophy is to himself. I
noted before in his Leviathan, how he joined the heart with the brain in his
production of sense, and presently after the heart alone: but here, clean
contrary, he puts the seat of sense to be the brain, spirits, or some internal
substance of the head; which contradictions seem to me most extremely strange
in a man so cried up for learning, in a book so labored, unless a man could
think that, conceiving himself infallible, he should write Quicquid in Buccam
venerit, what came next. I come now to his proof of his conclusion, which is
Numb. 7.

Sect. 5.
[ For the 3. we are to consider, first, that every great agitation, Sparks
appearing upon a str^ke on the eye not from any concussion of the brain.
or concussion of the b^aine (as it happens from a stroke, especially if the
stroke be upon the eye) where the Optic Nerve suffers any great violence,
there appears before the eye a certain light] I w^ll stop here, and examine
it piecemeal. Could a man imagine such a perturbed discourse to come from so
learned a man? He begins with a high language of a great concussion in the
brain, which I wondered how he could fetch about, and exemplifies only, as it
happens from a stroke, especially if the stroke be upon the eye. What
proportion has a stroke upon the eye to a concussion of the brain? though some
sparks (as I remember in my childhood, for I will not try those experiments
now) though such sparks, I say, may appear after a stroke upon the eye, yet I
cannot conceive why any such thing proportionable should happen from a
concussion of the brain. From the crystalline humor* not the optic nerve.
He proceeds [ which light is nothing without but an apparition only, all that
is real, being the concussion or motion of that Nerve] For this instance,
although it be not necessary, as you will see anon, yet, for satisfaction of
the reader, I will set down my conceit of it, as I can remember the
experiment of this great rule, Nosce teipsum, thus; That fire, light or sparks
(for such it seemed to me) which after a great blow flasheth out of the eye, I
conceive not to be any issue of the Optic Nerve, which is no way capable, in
my judgment, of producing such an effect; but proceeds either from the white or
crystalline humor, either of which may have a disposition to it, the
crystalline humor, like such a light substance agitated in the dark, may
chance to make a little flaring. For the white, as I have seen a very white Cat
in the dark, or a very white Napkin, firm and stiff, struck in the dark, send
out visible sparks, like those of fire, being, as I think, nothing but strong
emission of species. Now the eye is utterly in the dark, for the present, upon
such a blow, and therefore these little irruptions of its own light, quickly
stopped by some opposition, may return themselves a spectacle to that eye out of
which they came; what he says, That this light is nothing without, I deny it,
it is, as I expressed, the sparkling, not from the Nerve, but either the white
or crystall^ne humor, or both; This is my conceit, and has for its proof
some Illustrations from other experiments, when his device of the optic Nerve
has no color for what he affirms, nor can he show me any thing like it
besides; but if he could, let him know, that it is a poor arguing for such a
man, who despises Universitie learning, to argue an universal conclusion
concerning Sense, from a particular Inst^nce, from a disturbed organ; we poor
people, that have been only used to University learning, have a conceit
amongst us, that that great Axiom, upon which all Philosophy, and perhaps
Divinity too is founded, That sense is not deceived, when it is conversant
about its proper object, must be understood of a right Medium, a well disposed
organ, or else it may, yea, will be deceived, when either of these fail. For
him therefore to draw an Aphorism from an experiment of sense, where the Organ
is indisposed, must be so far from a good deduction, as a man would argue the
contrary.

Sect. 6.
Let us consider next his Inference, which is this [ from which Experience we
may conclude, Mr. Hobbes illogical in hi^ proo^s.
that apparition of light is really nothing but motion within] Now suppose th^s
to be granted him, it proves not his conclusion, which is, that color or image
is but an Apparition of motion, etc. There is much difference between these two
propositions, first in their subjects, a great deal of difference betwixt
color and Image, which make the subject of his proposition to be proved, and
light, which is the subject of this conclusion which he deduceth, for light is
neither color not image, but an illustration of both. 2ly. In the predicate,
for an apparition of Motion is one thing, and Motion its self is another. Thus
here is poor Logic in this argument, where there is no semblance, how this
conclusion, set down here, is deduced out of the premises: first, it is
absolutely naught (as I have showed) to prove an Universal conclusion,
concerning sense, from a particular instance, and that instance from an
indisposed Organ, and that instance it self no where offered to be proved; for
where does he prove, that that light is nothing without? where does he prove,
that all that is real in that light, is the concussion or motion, of the Optic
Nerve? Now for a man to enforce a conclusion against all the Universities of
Christendom, and all the reason of Philosophy out of Christendom, the
Arabians and ancient Grecians, and not show any proof, or evidence, of his
premises, was, as if, like another Mahomet, he would maintain his opinion by
his sword, without which he has no one argument.

Sect. 7.
But he makes another inference as impertinent as the former [If therefore
(says he) from lucide bodies there can be derived motion, so as to affect the
Optic Nerve in such manner as is proper thereunto, there will follow an Image
of light somewhere in that line, by which the motion was last derived to the
eye] He has one phrase here, which, His inference amiss.
leaving it, as he does, unexplained, gives a great trouble to the
understanding of this proposition, and that is [ In such manner as is proper
thereunto] what is this proper manner, he should have cleared, I am sure he
making it an Inference, with a Therefore, out of the premises, we ought to
conceive nothing but a violent stroke, which a lucide body at a distance cannot
give, as will, I think, And so likewise his conclusion.
appear hereafter. But as his inference is amiss, so is his conclusion, there
is no Image of light made by its shining, but of the light body the light it
self is the medium, through which the Image of the lucide, or colored body, is
conveyed to the eye, but its self has not an Image, nor is seen, as is
evident; let light shine upon the water, Light shining upon the water.
if it come obliquely, or by the interposition of clouds, the body of the Sun
or Moon, or any other lucide body, is not reflected, we see nothing but the
bare water; and indeed if light in it self could terminate our sight, it could
not be the proper means to convey colors to us, but would rather stop their
progress, or else colored pellucid-things, would deliver all things colored
like them selves, as colored glasses; it is not true therefore that there
would follow an Image of light, and, if it would, for the reasons before, that
argues nothing for color; and if there be an Image in the line spoke of, yet
that is so far from proving that it is an Image of the motion, as it proves
the clear contrary, it is an Image of light, and not of motion: for although,
perhaps, he may say, it is an Image of light in motion, yet it is an Image of
the light, not of the motion, which was his proposition to prove.

Sect. 8.
But he proceeds to explain himself, [ That is to say, in the object, if we
look directly on it, and in the glass or water, when we look upon it in the
time of reflection, which in effect is the third proposition] consider first
the coherence, he said before, that the Image was in the line, Mr. Hobbes's
incoherence.
by which the object was last, etc. (mark now) that is to say, in the object or
glass; you cannot say, that the object or glass were in the line, but one of
the extreme terms of the line, and indeed not Terminus Initians, beginning,
which, in some sense, may be said in the line; but Terminus a quo, the term
from which the line takes its motion, which can in no sense be said to be in
it: Then conceive that he says, the Image is in the object, when we look
directly upon it; which is most unreasonable, that the Image, and the thing
imagined, should be in the same subject: Then conceive it to be affirmed of the
Image of light, of which he spoke, the Image of that is no where, The image of
light where.
as I have showed; it self indeed, as it is propagated, is Imago lucis, an
Image of that light, which is inherent in some lucide bodies, as I have
conceived, and if not, because I love not to multiply controversies, yet it is
such a thing, which neither is, nor can be represented by any image, but only
as it is incorporated into some body; so that a light body may be seen in a
glass or water, but not light its self, neither in its self, or Image
terminating our sight: Now (says he) this in effect is the third proposition;
but let a man put them together, and see which way these can prove, that Image
and color is but an apparition of motion, there is no appearance of proof. But
he seems to proceed in proof of this cause, numb. 8. This number is very long,
I will therefore take it in pieces.

Sect. 9.
But (says he) that from all lucide shining, illuminate bodies, there is a
motion produced to the eye, and through the eye to the optic Nerve, and so
into the brain, by which that apparition of light and color is affected (I
think it should be effected, is not hard to prove) This Proposition, if proved,
conduces not to the confirmation of the conclusion which he intends; the
conclusion which he aims at is, that image and color are an apparition of
motion: Now here he says, he will prove that by this motion, Mr. Hobbes's
illogical way of discoursing.
which he speaks of, the apparition of light and color is effected; his
Proposition is, that image and color are apparitions of motion; he sets down
to be proved, that by this motion there is an apparition of light and color;
Image and color are the subject in one of the Propositions, and motion the
predicate; motion the subject in the latter, and light and color the
predicate; in nothing the same, which is a most illogical way of discoursing,
and extremely fallacious to any Reader, who, by this means, when he finds any
thing proved, mistrusts that all is so, although he know not why: So it seems,
if this were granted, it were not material; but let us see his proof.

Sect. 10.
And first (says he) it is evident that the fire, the only lucide body upon
earth, works by motion equally every way, insomuch as the motion of it stopped
or enclosed, it is presently extinguished, and no more fire: He is not to be
trusted, no not for that which he says he sees, for that which he says is
evident, I am confident, to him that has eyes, appears otherwise, that fire
does not work equally every way; for a candle, any fire that you ever looked
on, consider whether it move not by its flame upwards; for although in a candle
it necessarily creep downward for its sustenance, yet the motion of the fire is
upward more then any other way, whether the endeavor it has to propagate its
like, which is innate in every thing, makes it follow the smoke, as a fit
matter to be ignified and made fire* or a desire to ascend to the place of
motion, as heavy things downward (which I am likely to vindicate from his scorn
hereafter) whatsoever it is, that it is done, is evident, against that which he
says is evident, that it moves equally every way.

Sect. 11.
Why he should say what follows I understand not, that is [ in so much as the
motion of it stopped, or enclosed, it is presently extinguished, and no more
fire] for this no way proves or illustrates the equal motion of the fire; for
first the hindering of the operation of the second acts, How fire is
extinguished by enclosure.
does not destroy the first, and essence of any thing; the stoping of the
streams, does not presently destroy the Fountain, but the taking away the
Fountain dries the stream; and so it is betwixt the first act, which is the
form of any thing, and the second, which are the operations. Now the hindering
a man from discourse, which is a second act, does not destroy his being and
nature; to hinder or stop the motion of fire is such: And that which he says,
that it is presently extinguished, and no more fire, he must take that term (
presently) in a very large sense, for a little time, for we see fire, raked up
in embers, keeps its being many hours, yea days, without motion, but feeding
upon its own bowels, and consuming away; but it is then ruined by enclosure,
when no air is suffered to come to nourish it, or else some fumes, distilled
down upon it, do suffocate it, as I say then, so I may add therefore, not
because its motions are stopped or enclosed, for which he gives no reason, but
because it lacks air to nourish it, or is suffocated, as before; yet suppose it
were, this is done when the motion principally aims upward, no whit the more
for its distending its self about: In my life I never read a reasonable man
talk so unreasonably of sense.

Sect. 12.
He goes on [ And further, that that motion, whereby the fire works is
dilation and contraction of it self alternately, commonly called Scintillation,
or glowing, is manifest also by experience. That it has no positive
contraction.
] There was never heard the like; did ever any man experimentally find such a
motion? or was ever contraction called glowing or sparkling? the motion of fire
is either that which is natural to inflame or ignifie the neighboring body,
or, what is in way to it, to heat and warm what is about it, and by that, and
that, effect out of it exsiccation to prepare a matter for a form of fire,
other motion I acknowledge none in fire; that which he calls contraction, I
conceive to be nothing but when the smoke or ambient air supplies it not with a
fit matter for a flame, then negatively it cannot break forth in that inflaming
act, so far as it did before; but for a positive contraction, and withdrawing
it self, I absolutely deny, for every natural Agent does always work, quoad
posse, as much, and as far as it can, with all its force, and therefore the
fire always dilates, but never contracts, for lack of matter it cannot dilate
as far as it did before, but it never contracts: Consider here how little
credit is to be given to his words, who cries, it is evident, it is manifest,
to those things which have no semblance of truth, nor does he give them any
probable proof, but only his authority to induce an assent.

Sect. 13.
He proceeds [ From such a motion of the fire must needs a^ise a rejection, or
casting from it self of that part of the medium, which is contiguous to it,
whereby that part also rejects the next, and so successively] until at last
he brings it through the Optic Nerve to the brain; No rejection of the
contiguous m^dium.
I deny that fire has this local motion (b^t if any be, it is upward only) the
motion proper to fire is ignifying, and, in order to that, calefaction and
exsiccation, that rejection or casting away of the air, and so driving the air
before it to the eye, as he would make us conceive, is impossible, which I will
thus demonstrate; Suppose two Beacons, twenty miles distant each from other,
the Beacons both set on fire together, the watchman of either Beacon sees
either fire; now if the motion by which the fire of each Beacon has access to
the eye of the watchmen, should be this rejection of the air he speaks of,
these two ayrs, thus rejected, must needs meet in the medium, and in that local
motion, being aerial bodies, encounter, and either stop each other, or one
drive the other backward, and so it is impossible that both Beacons should be
seen, because the rejection of the air to the watchers eye is either stopped in
both, or at the least in one; so likewise should you put a body of glass
betwixt the fire and your eye, that glass would hinder the motion of the air
to your eye, but yet perhaps would enlarge the visibility of the fire, or, at
least, the glass being transparent, the eye would see the fire, although the
air came not at it. Thus you see an impossibility of this action in its first
setting out, and his fancy of sense stifled in its birth, therefore there can
no good be expected from it in the progress. But, lest I boast more then do, I
will likewise examine that piece.

Sect. 14.
Having brought the stroke of the fire, as he conceives to the brain, No
rebound from the brain to the Optic nerve.
he then says (that the brain, by resistance or reaction, makes that motion
rebound to the Optic Nerve, which we not conceiving as motion, or rebound from
within, do think it is without, and call is light, as has been already showed
by a str^ak) Why he should so insist upon this strange, and, until by him,
unheard of rebound, I cannot imagine; he gives no reason for it, nor do I
think the subject is capable of any; certainly the eye it self is a most tender
part, and apprehensive of a stroke from abroad, as well as from a rebound, and
certainly the stroke is stronger coming from the fire immediately, then
rebounding from the brain, neither is the brain a fit object to make a rebound,
rebounds are made by hard and solid bodies, the strokes made upon beds,
cushions, and the like, sink, and are lost in them; the rebound is scarce any
thing, if any thing, but the brain is such. Now, as I have said before, there
is no reason why the brain should expel every object; and again, it may be
urged, that either the brain or the eye is the organ of this sense, (no man
knows by his discourse what he will say) If the brain, why should it only then
perceive the object when it rebounds to the Optic Nerve, and not whilst the
stroke is within it self? If the eye be the organ, as certainly it is, why does
it not perceive the object before the rebound, as well as after; as it passes
to the brain, as well as when it comes from it? I am persuaded he can answer
nothing to this Dilemma; what he says, that ( we not conceiving as motion, or
rebound from within, do think it is without) is true, if he affirm it of light
or color, as he does, for we can learn from him no reason to the contrary, and
all sense shows us the thing without, and therefore we conceive it such; what
he speaks of his instance of a stroke, I have spoke to it before, but here add,
that there is a mighty difference betwixt that violent motion, which he
expresses from a stroke upon the eye, which flasheth fire out of the eye, and
this natural motion, which proceeding from the visible object, creeps into the
eye by the sight of it: I can conceive the first may happen to a blind eye;
such sparks, with a violent blow, may be beat out of it; I am confident, if his
Philosophy were true, that it comes from the Optic Nerve, it may be done upon
an eye that is blind, but this other passage of the object to the eye, is only
by the sight, and cannot be where the eye is not fitted for vision.

Sect. 15.
His further Philosophy about the Sun, is as strange (methinks) when he says,
( we have no reason to doubt, that the Fountain of light, the Sun, works any
other ways then the fire, at least in this matter.) This matter is in vision I
conceive, The Sun works not as Mr. Hobbes fancieth.
and that he would have the Sun work as he describes fire: but that will be
hard to prove: For first, he must show that the Sun moves by dilation, and
contraction: Secondly, that it has ambient air, or some such easily moved
body to be rejected by it: Thirdly, he must prove, that the Sun must so reject
that body, as to make it pass through the inferior Orbs; or else he must deny
that there are any Orbs, from all these things, which will be very difficult,
and those things which I have objected against that motion of fire, the Sun
must be vindicated from their opposition, before that conclusion will appear
probable, that the Sun works, in this act of vision, according to his method
before described; not but that I think the Sun and fire do both the same way
make themselves appear to our eyes; but as it appeared untrue when it was
affirmed of fire before, so that untruth appears more repugnant to reason,
when applied to the Sun.

Sect. 16.
He proceeds [ And thus all vision has its original from such motion as is
here described, for where there is no light, there is no sight, and therefore
color must be the same with light, as being the effect of the lucide bodies.]
Thus he; but there were never read such ( therefores) writ by a Scholar: How
does this Proposition, All vision has its original from such motion, His
independent inferences.
as is here described, arise out of this, where there is no light, there is no
sight? There is no dependence of one of these upon the other, and as little in
that which follows, and therefore color also must be the same with light, as
being the effect of the lucide body: do these things follow any of them? By
this logic a man may argue, because heat and light are the effects of fire,
therefore heat is light; when it is evident they are diverse, and affect diverse
senses.

Sect. 17.
But I will bestow a little business about the conclusion, Light and color two
things.
as well as the deduction, and show that light and color are two things, in
which I mean first to prove his conclusion false, that color or image are
nothing but the apparition of that motion he speaks of. Secondly, that color
is a real thing in the object. And lastly, that it is a distinct thing from
light.

CHAP. IV.
The apparition of color, its reality, and difference from light.

Sect. 1.
ANd first, that color or Image is not the Apparition of that Motion, I thus
prove; Color, or Image, not the apparition of motion, but of the object.
That which is the apparition of any thing, makes it appear in his own
colors, as we speak.

But this image or color (I take them as he puts them down together) makes not
that motion appear in its colors; ergo: 2 Argument.


The major is evident, for if a thing appear truly as it is, it appears in its
own likeness, and with such colors as it has, and unless it be a color,
this Image or color, he speaks of, makes nothing appear.

The minor I thus prove, If this image or color make the motion appear in its
colors, then that motion had color before; but that he denies, for he makes
color to be nothing but the apparition of motion, and if color or image be
the apparition of that motion, that motion must have color; because it makes
the motion appear in nothing but color, either it must have color, or it
cannot appear by color, or the image of color.

Again, I can confute this his conclusion, thus; 2 Argument.
That which is the apparition of any other thing, when that other is the same,
then that is the same, and when that other varies or changes, that does so
likewise; but when the stroke or motion from the object is the same, the color
or image varies, and when that is diverse, the image is the same, therefore it
cannot be the apparition of that motion: The major is evident, for the
apparition of any thing, is nothing but the showing of it as it is: The minor
will be thus illustrated; Suppose two walls equally big, the one black, the
other green, these equally strike the brain, the one as the other, but the
image or color represented is black or green, diverse; but if any man shall
object, that these do not equally strike the brain, I will let him make them
equal in all things but the color, and then they must equally strike, or if,
not, the color of the wall, not the motion in the brain, is that which only
appears and makes the difference. Again, when the stroke is diverse, sometimes
the color or image is the same; so if we should conceive the strength and
difference of motions, we must needs think that solid and strong bodies should
move and strike the eye harder then soft and gentle, yet they may easily appear
of one color; as we may see a Downe-bed, and a stone; either of these
instances is enough to show, that color or image is not the apparition of that
motion, but of the object which makes that motion.

Sect. 2.
Color a real thing in the object.
This I conceive, with what went before, may be abundantly enough for the
confutation of his conclusion. And next I come, to my second Proposition, which
is, That color is a real thing in the object; to prove this, I shall use this
medium; That which produces real effects, is a real thing; but color in the
object produces real effects; therefore, etc.

The major has its evidence from hence, that nothing can cause an effect
nobler, 1 Argument.
or more excellent then it self, which if color, that is in the object, be not
a real thing, it should do, when it produces real effects. The minor may be
demonstrated by many experiences, because some colors dissipate the Sunbeams,
some congregate them, which are real effects: As for instance, take one of your
ordinary Burning glasses, use all the art you can, it will not burn white paper
or linen, they scatter the beams; but black, or color the paper or linen,
it will inflame it, and so much the easier, the nearer any color comes to
black, which will collect these beams; this is a sign undeniable, that there is
some color in that linen or paper which has these effects. Again, some
colors hurt the sight of the eye, as red, white, and light colors; some are
grateful to it, as black or green, these are real effects, and every man's daily
experience shows them to be so.

Secondly, 2 Argument.
This may be proved from that operation it has upon a man's eye; for since the
stroke, which he conceives is made upon the eye, must needs be the same made by
a white or black wall, as I have showed, or more close, the same wall now
white, and anon souted or blacked, it cannot be that the diverse species or
Image, which is wrought in the eye, can proceed from any thing but that very
Color which is in the wall, because the diversity of the Image must needs
argue some diversity of cause, which can be none but the color of the object,
upon examination of all other pretended causes, for that varying, the image
alters; and that remaining the same, the image does so likewise, and this so
constant, that to all eyes, well disposed, it appears such, whatsoever they
are, so the medium be not some way or other clouded; which must needs argue a
certainty of causation to him, who in this very Proposition allows the object a
causing virtue; because it is a motion from the object, which is by this image
made appear; now the motion is the same from black or green, but the color
only differs.

3 Argument, or instance of A. B. in the book.
Thirdly, let the Gentleman consider what he did mean to do, when he writ this
book; did he mean to color the paper with real letters, or fancy only? if not
with real letters, how could he expect that one word should not be taken for
another? he could never think that A. should force the eye or brain, otherwise
then B. does, and so cause another Image, but out of this, that he colored the
paper in another figure, when he made A. then when he made B. Let a man again
conceive, that in the same feather of a Cock, he discernes one speck of white,
another of red, another of black, and those are all discerned by another man's
eye; let a man think what can so distinguish these colors in this, and not in
another feather, but that these colors are there, and not in another. It is a
strange thing that his wit should think to persuade a man, not only against
his own eyes, but all the eyes in the world, and all the reason too, but his
own. Well, I conceive this is enough for these two Propositions, That color
is not the Apparition of that motion, and that color is a real thing in this
object: These two passed Propositions are such, wherein I have disputed with
Master Hobbes, no man that I ever read of opposing my conclusions, but himself.

Sect. 3.
In the next I find various opinions among Scholars, which if he would have
studied, Color and light not the same thing.
although not for truth, but to maintain his own opinion only, although
against truth (which I doubt he unluckily affects) he might have found much
more probable reasons for what he affirms, then any produced by him. The
conclusion defended by him, and denied by me, is, That color and light are the
same thing; this he demonstrates thus, toward the later end of the 8. number.
where before [ Their difference being only this, that when the light comes
directly from the fountain to the eye, or indirectly by reflection from clean
and polite bodies, and such as have not inward particular motion internal to
alter it, we call it light; but when it comes to the eye by refl^ction, from
uneven, rough, and course bodies, or such as are affected with internal motion
of their own to alter it, then we call it color, color and light differing
only in this, that the one is pure, the other perturbed light] Although to
deny is answer sufficient enough for all is said, there being no proof, but as
if he were another Moses, he delivers his Philosophy as authentic, coming
from his mouth without any arguments, although against the opinions of the
whole world; yet I will in little lay open some weaknesses in these
expressions: First, think what he means by inward particular motion internal
to alter light; certainly unless he means the causes of color, which must be
against himself, I know not what it can be; and then inward motion internal,
which should have power to alter light which is external, to that body, was an
uneven and course kind of expression, if it express any thing; but the
weakness of the whole appears to any man that has eyes; for whereas he
says, when it comes to the eye by reflection, from uneven, rough, and course
bodies, or such, etc. there we call it color (speaking of light) I say let it
come from the most even, most clean and polite bodies that can be imagined,
that Nature or Art have made, as Brass, Silver, Gold, yea, heaven it self, we
call it color, as one Star is red, another more white; and therefore this
Gentleman is either mistaken, or would deceive in the usage of speech.

His conclusion it self may be thus overthrown.

Sect. 4.
1 A^gument.
That which exists when there is no light, that cannot be the same thing with
light: But color exists where there is no light, ergo, color is not the same
with light.

The major is evident, because the same cannot be, and not be, at the same
time, which would be true, if at the same time color and light being the same,
color should be, and light not.

The minor will be proved thus; Colors are in the dark where light is not,
that will be proved, because at night, when light leaves our Horizon, yet the
colors remain the same they were before; and that is proved, because when
light (although another light) is brought to them, yet they are, and they
apppear the same they were before: Now we have an Axiom in nature, and to be
over-master'd and checked by nothing but divine power, a privatione ad habitum
non datur regressus, there is no recalling a word that is spoke, no making that
not done, which is once done; not making that up individually and completely
the same which is destroyed; no restoring a form, and being once lost; now
this being the same it was, and appearing so at the coming of the second light,
which it was at the manifestation of the first, it is evident that the light
did not give this color its being, but only the manifestation of its being,
and this color was something besides light, which was made appear by light; I
know not what can be answered to this any further.

2 Argument.
Again, I can dispute thus, That which opposes light cannot be the same with
light; but some colors oppose light; Ergo:

The major appears, because nothing opposes it self; the minor is thus
illustrated, because black opposes light, for light has an affinity with
white, and black with darkness, so that such Stars, which have not something
to vary their representation, to us appear white, and so do candles, and these
white things, amongst us, have something of light in them, and great affinity
to it, and therefore are better discerned with a weak and evening light, then
darker Clouds are. So likewise black has an affinity with darkness, which is
the total privation of light, insomuch as a shadow, which is a partial
privation of light in a particular place, is black, intentionally black, as I
shall discourse hereafter: It is true, that neither black, nor any color, can
be seen without light, no more can a shadow; but dark, and black colors and
shadows, do oppose light, which is a kind of white, when in reality it is in
its own subject, as the Sun, or Star, or Candle. This certainly, joined to what
went before, may serve for my last Proposition. But because there are other
Opposers of this conclusion besides himself, now I am in, I will speak
something to their arguments.

CHAP. V.
The reality of color vindicated by intentional colors and species.

Sect. 1.
THe first and chiefest I find is, because colors without light are visible
only Potentia, Arguments against the reality of colors answered.
only indeed visible but reduced into act, and seen by being enlightened; so
that then by this light they are reduced into act, and therefore light is their
form. 1 Argument.


For answer to this argument, we must know that the being and nature of things
consists not in their second acts as they are called, Wherein the being and
nature of things consists, and how they are distinguished.
which are their operations, but in their first acts, which give them their
abilities to work, and they are distinguished by their abilities to operate,
when time, and other opportunities, and accommodations are offered; not by
their operations themselves. Thus vegetative creatures are distinguished from
things inanimate, not by their operations of growth or generation, for then
they should not be vegetable creatures in Winter, but by their abilities to
grow or generate when their season is offered; and as their abilities
distinguish them from others, so amongst themselves their several species,
natures, or kinds are distinguished by their abilities to produce several sorts
of things by those operations, not by the operations themselves: so it is in
all things, the abilities to sense, not the act of sensation, make an Animal;
the ability to discourse, not the act, makes the man; for else a beast should
not be a beast when he is asleep, nor a man a man, when he is either asleep, or
a child. I could instance in all things, quantities, qualities whatsoever: This
explains and answers this argument, although color cannot actually be seen in
the dark, yet that concerns not the nature, but the operation of colors, their
second act, not their first; they have in them a power of being seen upon
occasions and opportunities, even when they are in the dark; darkness to them
is like Winter to vegetals, like sleep to beasts, like infancy to man; and as
well may they say, that the springing weather, which reduces the tree to grow,
is the tree; that the stroke or blow which wakened the sleepy Lion, is the
Lion; that act which enabled the child first to discourse, is the man, as this
light the color; because of its awaking it to an actual emission of species,
or being seen.

Sect. 2.
Another main argument, 2 Argument.
which is urged against the distinction betwixt light and color, is thus
formed; There is the same reason of all colors, as colors, as of any; but we
know that some colors are nothing but light reflected, therefore we may
conclude the same of all.

The major it self stands upon its own strength, by that word (as colors) for
where there is the same being, there is the same reason or cause of that being.
The minor is exemplified in the colors of Pigeons necks, in those colors
made by a glass of Red-wine, set upon a white cloth, when a great light, or
the Sun shines upon the Wine, it will give an eye of red to the white cloth
which is under it, as likewise the Sun shining through the colored glass;
these are real colors, but are nothing but light variously reflected;
therefore there are colors which are nothing but light.

Sect. 3.
For answer to this, we may say to the major, Answ. Colors real and
intentional not the same.
that there is the same reason of all colors, as colors, which are real
colors and material; but that there should be the same reason and nature with
them, and intentionall, apparent or spiritual colors (for by these names they
are called) there being but a nominal, and some outward circumstantive
convenience only, is very illogically spoken; as if one should say, that a
living, and painted, or dead horse were the same, and had the same nature. To
show the convenience and difference of these from real colors, observe that
they both are the object of the sight; that when the eye sees that broken light
through the red glass, it sees a thing, for what is not, cannot be the object
of sense, and because it is seen, it is not unjustly called a color, for
color is the object of sight, and in that actual relation to the sight, they
have both one common nature; but here is the difference, that to the one light
gives its being, to the other, only its being seen, for the light falling
thick in with that species and images sent forth in their first and strongest
emission, when they come immediately from the object, it mingles with them, and
gives them a luster from it self, which is a shining color; but in all real
colors the light adds nothing but a making of them fit to be actually seen;
and that they are one real, the other intentional colors, appears by this,
that the real are inherent in the object, which is their subject, and so the
white of this paper I write upon is inherent in it, and is moved with the
motion of this paper, which is the object of my sight at this time; but red,
which falls from the glass of wine upon a white cloth, or these colors on
Pigeons necks, move not with the cloth or the Pidgeon, for take the Pidgeon
out of the flaring light, and you shall see only his real colors; and remove
the white cloth, and it retains only its whiteness, which is the inherent
color, and the intentionall color follows the glass and light, not its
subject; so that here we find the perfect nature of a real, absolute, inherent
accident in the one, and but of an intentional relative adherent accident in
the other. And here appears a diverse nature in these two sorts of colors,
they differ in their real nature, although they agree in the relative; and you
may see it further illustrated thus: The same thing cannot at the same time
have two real colors, red and white, but the white cloth, though shadowed with
red from the wine, is white at that time it is so shadowed, which appears,
because remove the shadowing body only, which is the glass, and there is the
same whiteness, without any alteration or motion in the cloth; and therefore it
was the same before, but only received an eye of red from the glass. This may
serve for the major, that there is the same reason of all colors, I say all
real, not intentionall and real.

Secondly, to the minor, that must prove that these intentional colors do not
differ from the light, Intentional colors not the same with light*
which I deny; for although light is an ingredient in the constitution of them,
yet it is not the total, no not refracted light, but as it mixeth with diverse
colors, so it appears diversely, and then, as you cannot say a book is nothing
but paper, or paper inked, but a paper written or printed; as a medicine cannot
be said to be Rubarb, although Rubarb be in it, when there are many other
ingredients, and perhaps others more predominant. So is it with this matter,
although these intentional colors have light in them, yet they are something
else besides light. And thus superabundantly; this latter part concerns not his
book, nor indeed, had he erred in this conclusion only, that light is color,
would I have censured him, he had learned men in the same cause engaged with
him; but when he thought this should countenance these other Propositions, that
there was nothing but an apparition of motion: Secondly, that color was no
real thing in the object, which was abhorring to all sense and teason that was
ever bestowed upon these things; finding it in the lump, and thinking it a
mistake, have wasted this paper about it.

Sect. 4.
But I have not yet finished this business; in the latter end of his first
chapter of his Leviathan, he says, ( That the Philosophy Schools throughout
christendom, grounded upon some Texts of Aristotle, teach another doctrine
from him, and say, for the cause of vision, the thing seen sends forth a
visible species, (in English) a visible show, apparition, or aspect, the
receiving whereof is sight, etc.)

Sight more then a bare reception of spe^^ies.
This I must censure, and say, that I think that scarce any Philosophie-School
teaches this conclusion, that the receiving the species is sight, but the
judgment of the soul upon the receipt, for receipt is a mere passive thing, but
all the language in the world makes to see an active verb; if receipt of the
species should make sight, then a Looking-glass would see, for that receives
the species, and truly the eye is a kind of animate Looking-glass, as a
Looking-glass an inanimate eye; but the difference lies in the activity of the
soul, which animates the eye, but not the Looking-glass.

The conceit of species not founded only upon Aristotle's Texts.
But he is angry with the conceit of species, and would have men believe, that
that opinion, so universally held, is founded only upon some Texts of
Aristotle; but I will tell him, it is not so founded upon Texts, as if his
only authority had gained the general esteem, which that truth has obtained
upon men's judgments, but the reasons of him and his followers, which this
Gentleman should have endeavored to have answered, and not have thought that
his bare credit, with scorning it, should prevail against Christendom. But
that a Reader may take notice of some of these reasons, and not trouble himself
to peruse other books, I will set down one or two, which may suffice.

Sect. 5.
The first reason of Aristotle is drawn from our experience thus; We all
observe, Aristotle's first reason for them.
that when we have discerned things by our senses, and the act of sensing
(pardon that word sensing, it is unusual, yet significant) is done, yet there
remains in the sensative memory, that image, which represented the object at
the first; now it is impossible that that should be any material corporeal
thing, for then how could so many huge Towers, Castles, Towns, Kingdoms, yea
heaven it self, if a material heaven, remain crowded in so narrow a compass?
how could such contraries, as black and white, hot and cold, fire and water,
high and low, remain in that little Ark of man's memory? if they were material
and real things, they could not, but being spiritual, intentional, and things,
as Philosophers speak, diminutae entitatis, they make a shift, with their
little entities, to creep into such a corner: And this confounds likewise
another Proposition of his, that the reception of these species makes sense;
for these entities are received and retained, and kept fast in that box which
received them, the memory, but are not sense any longer then they are hot, and
fresh from the object; well, then there must be such things as these species,
or else there could be no memory of the object, which, in a material condition,
could not exist in the memory.

A second argument may be drawn from another experiment; suppose Aristotle
looks upon Plato, A second argument from Aristotle's image in Plato's eye.
Aristotle cannot see his own face, but in Plato's eyes he can; how can that
come about, but that some intentional, species and image of him crept into
Plato's eye? a material thing could not, it must be an intentionall, for any
material thing would be offensive to Plato's eye, nor could it be that Gamboll
he talks of so much, a stroke from the object, for then it must have made Plato
see Aristotle, not Aristotle himself, according to his Philosophy.

3 Argument.
A third argument I can frame thus; Every object, which is distant from the
organ, must some way or other make it self reach the organ with its own
likeness; but for a real passage of colors, or such like objects, there can
be no imagination, there are but two ways, either by the propagation of this
image, intentionally, through the whole medium, which therefore is not
discerned in its passage through the air, because the motion is extremely
swift, like the passage of light, instantaneal; and because until it meets
with an eye, or glass, or something proper to give it a receipt, it has no
pause for a consideration: The species why so called.
This is the most common way of Philosophers; or else it must be by some
seminal virtue which it sends abroad, which, when it finds a womb fit to
entertain it, there is prolifical, and produces this image, and therefore in
that regard may be called species, because it is such in semine: Obj^ction
answered.
Now if it should be objected, that if it were the seed of colors, like the
seed of plants, it would produce a thing of the same nature, a real color,
not an intentionall; It is answered, that second qualities are like equivocal
agents, they cannot produce their own nature, like Mules, and the Monsters of
Nile, the furthest they go is their image; a color does not get a color of
its own nature, as heat does heat; nor can you make one thing white, by putting
another white thing to it, unless you add some of that white body to the
other: This conceit has much pleased me, and I think would meet with all
objections, but I am not peremptory in it, because I cannot afford my self
leisure to spend so much time about such a youthful study; but, howsoever, one
of these ways, I conjecture, whosoever shall think that the object works upon
the sense, (...) conceive it, and therefore these species. There are many other
arguments used by Philosophers, the least of which he has not touched, but
controuleth them, with only, It is otherwise. I will now leave this, and come
to his fourth and last Proposition, in his Humane Nature, where before, numb. 9.

CHAP. VI.
Concerning Echoes, production of sounds, and external objects, etc.

HIs Proposition is, [That as in conception of Vision, so also in conceptions
that arise from the other senses, the subject of their inherence is not the
subject (I think it false printed, he means sure the object) but the Sentient.

Sect. 1.
This Proposition is delivered in a strange fallacious way; Mr. Hobb^s
fallacious in his discourse.
for whereas his whole discourse and intent is to prove, that sound, as well as
color, is not in the object, but in the sentient; as with color he joined
images; So in this Proposition, which concerns other senses, he leaves out the
object, and only names the conception: It is undoubtedly true, that the
conception is in that part which conceives, not the conceived; but the business
which he labors to prove, and is in quest^o^ betwixt him and me is, Whether
there be any thing conceived out of the Sentient in the object; he says no,
and labors to prove it, Nu. 9.

Sect. 2.
The first argument he proves this by, is drawn from sounds, and, in them, from
echoes, (A man (says he) may hear double, or treble, by multiplication of
ec^^^es, which echoes (says he) are sounds, as well as the o^^ginal, and, not
being in one and the same place, cannot be inherent in the body that makes
them.)

This argument receives its answer variously from Philosophers, The
Philosophers first opinion concerning echoes.
according to their diverse conceits of the nature of sounds; for such as
conceive sounds to be carried in their real nature, by the motion of the air,
to the organ of sense, these conclude an echo to be a new sound propagated by
the former, differing from the first individually, not naturally, we may call
it, if you will, another of the same, as some Psalms of Hopkins and Sternholds
Translation; So that as we see musical instruments, two in the same room, one
Violl touched, the other, out of harmony of parts, being fitted and prepared
for such a motion and sound, receives the same, and that sound is the first,
but a little softer, which in a whispering place, as I have observed at
Gloucester Church, it would be stronger: Now this is another motion, a derived
motion, and a derived sound from the same first cause; but as the motion was
the immediate cause of the first sound; so the first sound was parent and
immediate cause of the second sound. Now here is a diverse sound and a diverse
subject, the ecchoing place, or the air dissipated and expulsed the subject of
that echo, but the bodies moved, or the air forced by these bodies, the
subject of the first. This is one way of Philosophers, and does abundantly
satisfy his objection, and show there are outward subjects to these two
sounds, each has his own.

But others make this echo a kind of rebound of that sound, not only stopping
the air, A second opinion of theirs concerning Echoes.
which carried the sound from going farther; but retorting it again from
whence it came, like a Ball, which moves at the first by the hand that banded
it out, but, when it is stopped by a wall, returns toward the place it moved
from first, if it meet with the wall in a right line to its motion, or, if
oblique, moves obliquely, and may in that motion be retorted by two or three
walls; and this answer shows the outward subject of this sound to be the air,
which carries it about with it, and is retorted.

A third way is, Their third opinion concerning echoes.
of such who conceive the subject of this sound to be air, in which at the
first it was propagated; and that sound, from that place and subject of its
birth, emitts, as colors do, its species and likeness which by ecchoing
places are entertained, as the images of colors are in looking-glasses, and
there show themselves, and from them multiply themselves to the ear, or perhaps
to other ecchoing places, as glasses transmit their species; and this likewise
fully answers his objection, and shows how there may be one subject, and diverse
echoes of the same sound; if the sound be double, it has a diverse subject;
if it be a rebound, the same ball is diversely retorted from the power of the
same stroke by diverse walls; if it be a species or likeness, the same color
with diverse images of it. Let no man expect my opinion, be it any of these; it
serves my turn to invalid his argument; and these opinions, and some
expressions like these, might he have observed in Philosophers, and ought to
have confuted.

Sect. 3.
But he proceeds with a Philosophical Axiom, Nothing can make any thing, Their
axiom cleard by the distinction of formally and ver^ually applied to instances,
which is not in it self. There are some rules given by Philosophers which are
something like this, as [ Nihil dat quod non habet] Nothing can give that to
another which it self has not. But not to trouble a Reader with other
distinctions, this is sufficient for our business, nothing can give another
what it self has not, either formaliter, formally inhering in it, or
virtualiter, that is, it has power of producing it. A man, who has not a penny
in his purse formally, yet having it vertually, can give another a thousand
pounds by his Bond or command to his Steward. The heavens, which, according to
Aristotle's Philosophy, have no heat in them formally, yet vertually, by their
Philosophy, produce heat in sublunary bodies: The steel and flint, which are
cold, and have no fire in them, no formal fire, yet knocked together, having it
vertually, produce fire enough to burn a world. Instances might fill this
sheet, but this last is very pat to this business: The two bodies, which make a
noise or sound, have not the noise or sound in them formally, but like fire in
a flint, so does sound lie asleep in them, and by their collision, and knocking
together, this fire is produced. I have discoursed of this Proposition before,
as it was applied to sight, under those terms (as I remember) that motion
produces, nothing but motion:

Sect. 4.
Mr. Hobbes's absurdities in the production of sounds.
I go on with him (he says the Clapper, the Bell, the air have motions, but not
sounds; then he brings this motion to the brain, and there he says is motion,
and not sound; last of all, he gives this motion a rebound from the brain to
the nerves outward, and thence it becomes an apparition without, which we call
sound.) What I have delivered before concerning the object of sight, I guess,
may be applied to this of sound; but in particular, here are some peculiar
absurdities, which I will examine, as that he says, the rebound to the nerves
outward, nerves in the plural number, not naming what; so that, by this
Philosophy, for all I see, a man may hear with his eyes or nose, for the
rebound may be made to them, and he names not any nerve of the ear; and truly,
for all I see by his rebounds, a man may see with his ears, and hear with his
eyes, for either of these are capable of such motions as he speaks of. But then
let me ask this Philosopher, how this motion becomes an apparition? Had that
motion that apparition before, or not? If not, how came it by if afterward?
neither could that motion give it that nature of a sound, or apparition, which
it had not, according to his Philosophy, nor any thing else that had it not. If
the motion had it before, then either in the brain, the air, the bell, or
clapper, which he denied. If any thing else had it before, and then produced
it, then there was sound before, and this was not the production of sound; but
he does not say that it is sound, but that the apparition is called sound; but
as before concerning light, of what was that an apparition? was is not an
apparition of sound? Then sound was somewhere else; and then how was it made an
apparition? was it made by that which had an apparition in it, or not, as
before?

Sect. 5.
This is all he has written there concerning sounds; he runs over all the
senses [ And (says he) to proceed to the rest of the senses, it is apparent
enough, that the some and taste of the same-thing are not the same to every
man, and therefore are not in the thing smelt or tasted, but in the men] short
and sweet, and he shall have as short an answer, nay, I shall make his argument
stronger, and then refute it: Smell and taste of the same thing, are not the
same to the same man at diverse times, Smell and Taste where.
and yet it does not follow that these qualities smelt are not in the object,
for the defects and ill qualifications of the Organ do disrelish and alter the
thing tasted; and yet, upon consideration of his terms, I grant his
Proposition, and his inference, but say, that neither prove the conclusion he
proposed. His Proposition is true, for he says, Smell and taste are in the
men, not in the thing smelt and tasted; it is true, these are immanent acts,
and are in the Organ, produced by the power of the sensitive soul, and are not
in the object; but this concludes not against the Universities, that as there
is no color in the object, so there should be no odor or savor, but produced
according to his bounds and rebounds; for although the immanent acts are in the
agents, yet the things smelt and tasted are elsewhere.

Sect. 6.
What difference between the heat in the fire, and transmitted to the hands,
and how it proves no nullity of an external object.
Last of all, he comes to the lowest sense of touch or feeling, and of this
sense, he says [ So likewise the heat, we feel from the fire, is manifestly
in us, and is quite different from the heat in the fire] I believe that he
speaks truth in this, that the heat in my hand is not that particular heat
which is in the fire, but yet that word quite different, was a large Phrase;
the difference is individual, not specifical; it is a stream of that Fountain,
and differs like a stream from the fountain, it loses by the course, it
walks in some degrees of those perfections which it enjoyed at its first
seting out: but, that it is another, appears, because take away the fire, and
the heat does not instantly follow the fire, but by degrees wears out of my
hand, just like a stream fed and supplied by a fountain, stop the fountain,
the streams will in little leisure decay, but not instantly be dried; as light
follows the Candle, or as a shadow the man whose shadow it is; This proves
it to be another heat from that of the fire; why do we read nothing of
apparitions, of bounds and rebounds? this is nothing to his purpose, that heat,
which is in my hand, is the Object of my feeling, and it is discerned by some
species which expresses its likeness, as other objects, and presents it to the
sensitive soul, which officiates this duty of judging of Touches in every part
of a man, which is animated by it, as it discernes colors by the eye, sounds
by the Ear, etc. But which way does this prove, because heat is in my hand,
which is felt, therefore there is nothing in the Object discerned. The nature
of those Prime qualities, Heat, Cold, Drought, Moisture, is such, that it
multiplies their nature even to the Organ, and thus only, immediately, sends
out its likeness; (whether this Organ be a nerve, or something else, I question
not,) but second Qualities, as light or heavy, hard or soft, touch but the
outward skins only, and there, and thence transmit their Species, which is so
apparent, as nothing can be more; for take the weight of Lead, and the
lightness of a feather, when discerned by a man's hand, can any man say these
are in the hand, or Lead, or feather? So likewise when I feel a down pillow,
and a hard stone, what is it I feel? a softness or hardness in my self? or a
gamboll of a bound or rebound? these things cannot be imagined, these are real
things in that pillow, in that stone, but send forth intentional, not real
Images into my hand; of their natures Real they cannot be, for if real, then my
hand should be light or heavy, hard or soft, when it discerns those Objects to
be such, for whatsoever has these real Qualities in it, is denominated by
them; and then some image there must be, because whatsoever is known, must be
known by reception into that faculty which knows it, if not in its self, yet
in its Species or Image; and so these, who in their realities cannot come at
the Organ, must do it by their Species. But this was much more then needed for
a refutation of what he said; but I have not done yet with him, for although
his Argument drawn from heat in my hand, to prove the nullitie of an external
Object, is vain, as I have showed, for this heat is external to the Organ of
that Sense; and although it be true, that the heat in my hand differs from that
in the fire, which did produce it; yet his Argument is most Illogical, with
which he endeavors to prove it thus.

Sect. 7.
[ For (says he) our heat is pleasure or pain, according as it is great or
moderate; Heat is neither pleasure nor pain, but a cause of both.
but in the coal there is no such thing] First consider the Proposition, then
the inference. In the Proposition, he affirms, that our heat is a pleasure or
pain, which is a most strange speech in a Philosophical discourse, where
propriety of speech is expected; and from that man, in that discourse, where,
like another Adam, he would impose Names upon every thing, and strives for
nothing more then to give things convenient expressions. To the business, heat
is neither pleasure, nor pain in us, it may produce both, according to the
convenience, or inconvenience it has with us, but is neither; heat is a cause
of sense, but sense is neither pleasure nor pain, but they are results out of
sense, as things agreeing or disagreeing to it; so that heat is a cause of
both, a remote cause, but formally it cannot be said to be either.

Sect. 8.
But suppose it be spoken figuratively (which, in these cases of Philosophical
punctual discourses, The same cause works different effects according to the
subject or object about which it is busied.
is not proper) the cause for the effect, does it follow, that therefore
because it is so in a man, and produces not that effect in the fire, therefore
it is not the same heat? certainly causes always work the same effect, where
the Subject is the same, but not else: heat hardens clay, which is a common
Instance, but softens wax; if fire had sense, as a man has, it would find
pain or pleasure, as a man does; or if a man had no sense like fire, he would
have no pain, or pleasure, as the fire has not; the same thing works diversely,
according to the Subject or Object it is busied about. This conceit of his, I
make no question, but meeting with his understanding, which was the Mother of
it, mightily pleased him, or else he would never have printed it in two Books,
and in one have cited the other; but certainly, meeting with my dull brain,
infected with contemptible Universitie learning, it displeases me exceedingly,
and therefore there is no arguing for the diversity of an Agent, from the
diversity of operation, when the Object is diverse, it works upon. And here he
concludes this business, saying, by this the fourth Proposition is proved,
etc. But how, let any man consider. Now I thought to have concluded with him,
but number 10. he crowds together such a heap of Solecismes, as must not pass
without a consideration of them. His number begins thus, [ And from hence also
it follows, that whatsoever accidents or qualities our sense makes us think
there be in the world, Sensible qualities more then mere apparitions.
they be not there, but are seeming, and apparitions onely] I never thought to
have read such a Proposition from a reasonable man: The Thief, who is to be
arraigned at the Bar, would be glad he could make the Judge to be of this
mind, when the evidence shall swear he saw him break up a house, or cut a
purse; if he could persuade the Judge that it were but an Apparition, there
were no such thing, it were well for him. But suppose this Gentleman's hand were
put into the fire, and when he cries out for pain, a man should tell him,
there is no such thing but only an apparition of it, do you think he would
believe him? But by this Doctrine he has one evasion, which I know not what to
say to, that is, when I shall charge him with it, he can reply, it was only an
apparition of such an opinion or discourse, but no such discourse; I can prove
it no other way, but that these eyes of mine showed it me in a book under his
name called Humane Nature, or another called Leviathan.

Sect. 9.
But, this being only a negative conclusion, he proceeds further to a positive
thus [ The things that really are in the world without us, are those motions by
which these seemings are caused] Surely there was never heard, or read, so much
nonsense, and yet it tastes not of folly, but a kind of madness, or else he
thinks the world is mad to receive such incredible fancies without color of
reason. Is all without us nothing but motion? Is the standing still of the
earth nothing but motion? Is the thing that moves nothing but motion, motion
moves somewhat that is not motion; if so, what does it move? A universe of
motion madly fancied by Mr. Hobbes.
whatsoever moves, moves something, and if that were motion, the question goes
on infinitely, unless we find something to be moved which is not motion;
substances, bodies, etc. are not motion; rest is not motion, much less are they
these motions by which these seemings are caused. I discern a stone hard, cold,
heavy, by sense; are these things, yea the stone it self, (for so they term the
things that really involves it) nothing but those motions by which they
appear? These things confute themselves; and yet I may go further; many of
these representations, apparitions, seemings, are without motion in the object;
the house, standing still unmoved, sends forth its image to my eye, without
motion; for all motion is but of six kinds, generation and corruption about
substances; augmentation and diminution about quantities; alteration about
qualities; lation, or local motion, about place; he can find none of these in
this house, neither in its substance, quantity, quality, place; but the motion
is in mine eye; no such thing neither; mine eye is changed none of these ways;
only an image brought to it, which is undiscernable by any sense but it self;
neither is the power of the soul moved, which then proceeds to discern the
object; for it is the same power it was before, without any real alteration or
change; for it has the same abilities it had, neither more nor less; but it
is true, there is an internal immament act, which results out of that power,
without any motion; or if it may, in an improper and forced way, be halled into
the notion of motion, in some unused acceptance, yet this must be an internal
motion within its self, none of those things he speaks of a motion.

Much of this is needless; that which suffices to show the weakness of his
reasoning, is to show, that there are hundreds of things discerned by us, which
are not motions, and that is most apparent. He proceeds [ And this is the great
deception of sense, which also is by sense to be corrected] If it were true,
that this were a deception, I should think it a great one, yea the most
universal deception that ever was in the world; but how it shall be corrected
by sense, that were worth the observing: He has showed it thus [ For as sense
tells me when I see directly, the color seems to be in the object, so also
sense tells me, when I see by reflection, that color is not in the object.]

Sect. 10.
Color in the object, when seen by reflection.
First of all observe, that if this were true, yet, being but a particular
instance, he cannot deduce that general conclusion out of it, concerning all
sights, much less concerning all other senses; then observe upon a direct
sight, he puts only a seeming to be in the object, but upon a reflex,
peremptorily, that it is not in the object; when, certainly, a direct sight
shows its object more clearly then any reflex. But now to his instance; why
does a reflex show it not to be in the object, he sets not down, but perhaps he
may say, in a glass the image may seem to be in the glass, and not in the
object; I say, the image, that which represents the object, is there, and I
have known a Robin Red-breast fighting with his own shadow in a glass. To this
I answer, that the sight judges of colors, Sight, when, and when not,
deceived.
and therein is not deceived, when the distance is not too great, nor the
organ, or medium, ill disposed; for that is its proper object, over which it
has power to judge; but in such things as are a common object to it, and other
senses, it is easily mistaken, of which kind are figures, greatness, or
littleness, distance of place, and many the like. Thus it mistakes the distance
of the Moon from the earth, the bigness of the stars; but then, besides these
common objects, there are other which are objectum per accidens, as Logicians,
an object not out of its own nature affecting that act or faculty in its self,
but by reason of some other thing to which it is annexed, or happens to be
joined; so we may say, we see Socrates or Plato, when we see them not, but
their color, and that color, of theirs, is the only thing by which they are
discerned by sight. Now there are mighty mistakes in our senses concerning
these; so when we see one man's clothes worn by another, we think him, at the
first, to be the man whose clothes he wears; so when we see that man to have a
red, who had a pale face, we think him not the same man. My opinion of this
mistake is, because although the vision of the color is an act of sight, yet
the applying that color to the person seems to be an act of reason, a work
out of the reach of pure sense. Sense judges not of color, but Reason by
collection from it.
This by the way of explication, to make all plain, that the Reader may the
fuller apprehend my answer to this objection; punctually then I answer, first,
that there is no such judgment of sense as to say, that color is not in the
object; for although sense, perhaps, can only discern the color in the glass;
yet sense meddles not with that question, whether the same color, can be in
two subjects; much less, whether this be a real color in the glass, or
whether an intentional, or whether it be in the glass or not; but if it do
meddle with this last, yet in that speech, which says it is in the glass,
sense meddles beyond its sphere, it judges in a cause which belongs not to its
Judicature, that may be disputed by reason between him and me, and sense may
give in evidence concerning what it knows circumstantially conducing to the
truth, but cannot judge of it, it is not its proper object; so then to say,
sense sees it in a glass, therefore there is no color in the object, is vain
to reason, which can discern that every accident follows its subject; remove
the glass from the face which got that image, and there is no such image in the
glass; and contrariwise, remove the man whither you will, the color is with
him, sticks in him, therefore color is inherent in him, but only from him
represented in the glass: The business of inhesion or adhesion belongs not to
sense to meddle with; the eye sees diverse colors in a Rainbow, it belongs not
to sense to judge whether they inhere there or no; so likewise in the Pigeons
neck, and wheresoever it finds them, Reason may dispute and collect from
sense, but Sense judges not. So that first, as I said, sense when it sees an
image in a Looking-glass, collects no negative Proposition, that it is not in
the object, no more then the sense of that man, who thinks he sees a man in the
Moon, should collect that, therefore there are none upon earth. Secondly, if it
judge at all of the subject of inherence, whether the glass or object be the
subject, yet this is so extrajudicial an act, so out of the reach of sense, as
therefore there is no strong building upon it; thus have I known horses
mistaken, and sheep, when the colouts have been the same, and the mistake has
seized upon reason guided by sense, so that men have sworn clean contrary; so
weak is Sense in judging of any thing but its proper object; when other things
are accidentally joined with the object, they pass an accidental and uncertain
judgment upon them; and his first conclusion is true, Sense tells me, or
rather, by the information of sense, I collect, that color is in the object,
when I see it directly; but his second can no way be true, that Sense tells
me, when I see by reflection, that color is not in the Object; for Sense makes
no such Judgment, and Reason with Sense makes a clean contrary collection.

Thus have I gone through these two Chapters, the first of Leviathan, the
second of Humane Nature, which be the Foundation of his whole Book; if the rest
prove of the same nature, my labor will be much lost to meddle with it; but I
will try some other pieces.

NOTES UPON THE Second Chapter of Leviathan.
CHAP. VII.
How all creatures affect rest or motion, as most convenient for them.

I Have traveled the first Chapter from the beginning to the end; I shall not
trouble the Reader, or my self, so with others, nor can I expect they should
deserve it; but if they should, I will let pass many things, and only touch
some remarkable passages, which may, in my judgment, be principally worth the
censuring.

Sect. 1.
He begins this Chapter with a sentence, which he calls an undoubted truth, and
I am confident is most absolute, and not to be doubted falsehood; that is, That
when a thing lies still, unless somewhat else stir it, it will lie still for
ever. This proposition is apparently false in all Animals, Animals will move
themselves after rest.
for every sensitive creature moves its self, and has the Principles of its
own motion in its self, unless the motion be violent; long rest is as unquiet
and tedious to such Beasts as long labor, and therefore they will rise, and
they will move themselves; rise, if for nothing else, yet out of a lassitude
they have of that lazy condition they were in; and likewise they arise and
move to their food and sustenance; so that the case put in that latitude and
indefinite term, A thing (without any limitation lies still, cannot look like a
truth, but that it coming from so learned a man, Every thing will move toward
its proper place.
men are amazed at the reading of it. But then go further, and let us view the
meanest things, even inanimate bodies; every thing is unquiet out of its proper
place, and presses and endeavors to get to it; and when it is out of its
place, will move toward it: Suppose a Plummet of lead hung in the Air by a
thread, in time the thread wears, the Plummet changes its place by falling down
to the earth, the Plummet moves its self downward; the breaking of the thread
cannot move it, for indeed the pressing of the weight of the Lead, which is out
of its place, breaks the thread, and moves both the thread and its self down; so
that let any thing lie still, yet it will move its self, if it be out of its
place. So likewise in motion upward, Take a Bladder full of Air, lay something
upon it which may keep it under Water, and let it rest there, then remove the
Obstacle which kept it down, it will ascend to its proper place above the
Water; and surely nothing but its self moves it, as is most apparent: so far is
this indefinite Axiom from an undoubted truth, that it is most evidently false
in all Animal motions, and in all natural motions, which are of things out of
their places.

Sect. 2.
His second Proposition is as bad, That when a thing is in motion, All animals,
being subject to ^assitude, req^ire rest.
it will eternally be in motion unless something else stop it; This is equally
false with the other: First, Animal Motions he grants presently after, Men
measuring other things by themselves, judge they are weary, and so go to rest.
This instance granted in a Man, confutes that indefinite term, when a thing is
in motion; and what he speaks of Men, there is the same reason of all sensitive
creatures, which abide a lassitude or weariness, as well as man, and must have
their Sabbath, their alternam requiem to refresh them, or they cannot subsist;
and therefore, when they are in long motions, go to rest themselves; and
certainly a man may justly say, that all the local motions of other things, as
well as Animals, Inanimates, by local motion, tend toward rest.
is to rest; the bladder, which moved it self before from under the Water,
rests it self upon the Water; the Plummet of Lead upon the earth; every thing,
when it gets its own place, rests in that: So in violent motions, when you
shoot an Arrow upward, it makes have downward of it self, against the violence,
and gets to the earth, where it may, and does rest; so that the nature of every
thing is so composed, that as it is unquiet out of its fit and natural place,
so it is quiet and rests in it: But he seems to give a reason for both
Propositions, namely, that nothing can change it self.

This may have some resemblance of truth, All things, able to overcome the ill
they are affected with, change themselves.
in respect of the essence of things, because every change seems to imply a
corruption and destruct^on of what it was changed from into that it was changed
into, and nothing can affect, or endeavors its own destruction, or ruin; but
yet when any body is aff^cted with hurtful accidents, it does change them for
its own advantage; the Water, when it has that destructive accident, heat in
it, by its own force and principles which are in it, works out that hurtful
heat, and reduces its self to its own temper of coldness, when the Violence,
which the fire offers to it, is removed. Thus heavy things move downwards,
light upwards, when they can remove, or when those Obstacles are removed, which
before kept them from their natural places. And thus natural bodies of Animals,
expel those hurtful poisonous things, which the strength of their natural
constitution can master; and thus all things, when they are beset with any ill
which they can overcome, change themselves. Thus it appears, that as his
Conclusions were erroneous, so his Reasons and Foundations, upon which he built
them, were weak, that nothing can change its self: What he adds of men's
measuring other things by themselves, must be affirmed of Fools, for I dare say
he never read Philosopher write so.

CHAP. VIII.
Of Appetite and Knowledge: how wisely methoded by God in all creatures, to the
effecting his ends.

ENough, I think, is said to that; but in the latter end of this Introduction,
I conceive it such, he seems to scorn that received Opinion, That heavy things
move downward out of an appetite to rest, and to conserve their nature, etc.
ascribing (says he) appetite and knowledge of what is good for their
preservaion (which is more then man has) to things inanimate, absurdly: Thus he.

Sect. 1.
This Proposition I censure, and shall show first, that there is such a thing;
then answer his objection. The distinction of Appetite into Natural and
rational, their conflicts, etc.
Appetite may be distinguished into Natural and Rational; Natural is the bent,
the disposition every thing has to the preservation of its self, as it is a
particular body; or the generality of the Universe, as it is a part of the
whole. Rational appetite is that which a thing has out of the knowledge it
has of the goodness and fitness which a thing has for him who does desire
it. Now that there is such an appetite, which we call natural, in every thing
which has not reason, is apparent in every such thing; so that no man can give
any account of such actions but by the appetite; As, Why should the Foxes have
holes, and the Fowls of the Air have nests, wherein they may lay up and
preserve their young, but this, that they have an appetite to preserve them; so
likewise, to come lower to his instance, Why do heavy things fall downward,
after they have been forced upwards, but that they would preserve themselves;
nay, to see these two appetites in the same man, will make it more evident.
Every man finds in himself, besides those politic designs which he has upon
study, and arise out of reason, natural desires, and appetites of Meat and
Drink, and this against his reasonable appetite; for when his Reason, upon
grounds of Physic, directs him not to eat, and, upon the control of Reason,
he denies himself Meat, yet he cannot choose but, by his natural appetite,
desire Meat; so likewise he has a natural appetite to live, even when Reason
shows him it is fit for him to dye, and to fall downwards, even when he would
mount upward. Thus we see there are appetites in irrational things, and the
irrational part in man, which is not rational; and these cross appetites make
great contestation in man about his actions; and sometimes the subject, natural
Appetite, does so powerf^lly take up Arms against its supreme, the reasonable
Appetite, that it conquers the reasonable Appetite, according to that famous
Speech of Medea, so much honored, both amongst Schools, Divines, and
Philosophers: -- Video meliora proboque
Deteriora sequor. --
I see what is good, and in my reason approve it, but act what in reason I
detest. This invincibly shows this Appetite, and that there is even in Natural
things, which have not the use of reason, an appetite to satisfy themselves in
what, some way or other, is good for them. Now then I will come to the Answer
of that Objection, of his, which he makes with scorn, that (says he) they
ascribe appetite and knowledge to things inanimate, which is more then man has.

Sect. 2.
The negative piece which says, which is more then man has, Appetite and
knowledge is no^ more then man has.
is very false; for although, by reason of his corrupt will, Man sometimes
mistakes ill for Good, Good for ill, and prosecutes these things accordingly;
yet he does not this as a Man, but as a depraved man, and either in things
which belong to his Election, having an indifferent nature; or else out of some
predominant passion within him, which as it draws his Will, so it blinds
oftentimes his Understanding; or else when there is a disguise put upon the
Obj^ct, which makes it appear other then it is; but Man, as Man, has abilities
both to know, and prosecute what is Good, and he always does desire what is
Good, at the least apparent, nor can he do otherwise.

Sect. 3.
For the affirmative part, that they ascribe to inanimate things appetite, and
Knowledge, etc. What appeti^e and knowledge ^in in^eriour ^^eat^res, and ho^
excellent^y disposed by providence.
I could answer out of my former distinction, that they do not ascribe a
rational, but a natural appetite, which many times is against reason, as I have
showed; but because we see, in unreasonable Animals, Swallows not only
building, but fortifying, their nests with such choice and selected Materials,
and those so artificially plastered together, as although Man may imitate, yet
he cannot equal the ingenuity of the work; because we observe Bees with such
Wonderful industry gathering, and, in such a constant method, contriving the
disposure of that harvest they lay up against the hard time of Winter, with
multitudes of such things which may amaze, and draw the wit of man to
admiration, rather then to contention to compare; because in the inferior
things we find such a consent and cooperation to the general good of the
Universe, as can be paralleled by no heroic virtue of any Roman or Romance;
that constantly the very Plebeians of the world, the meanest creatures do
expose themselves to a certain ru^n for the public good, as water ascends, air
descends to its own destruction, to avoid vacuity; when we shall consider, how,
as in Noah's a^k, for the preservation of their species, the wolf and lamb, the
lion and the bull, the horse and the bear, the hawke and the Partridge, live
in peace; so, for the same intention, fire and water, heat and cold, the
greatest enemies in the World meet, and inhabit, and live quietly and
harmoniously together, in the same body; I cannot choose but add that there is
the same hand and providence disposing one, as did the other, and so will
enlarge my answer to an exposition of this business.

Sect. 4.
First then consider, that when God, the Great Natura naturans (as the
Philosopher calls him) at the first made all the creatures in the world, Gods
wisdom, not Art, in the natures of all he made, and disposing the principles of
their several operations.
he gave each of them their several beings and natures, which were the
principles of all their operations, which according to those beings they
produced; not as he, in his Introduction to his Leviathan, began with somewhat
too high a line, ( Nature, the Art whereby God has made and governs the world)
certainly if it were lawful to call that infinite wise counsel of Gods Will,
whereby he works all things, and made and governs the World, an Art; yet we
could not call that Art, Nature, for Nature is a thing made by God, and
therefore not that thing, or Art, by which God did make the World, and in, or
with it Nature her self. Again, Nature works necessarily that which it works,
insomuch, as even in man, what he does naturally, is necessarily done; and what
by reason, liberally, or freely: so that here was a great boldness in him with
God, whilst he commended himself by a high and great phrase, to make that
phrase speak diminishingly of God, in these transcendent works of his: But to
return whence this observation distracted me; when God gave these natures to
every thing, he disposed them to advance his Great Design of the beauteous
World, and by that Nature, which he gave them, ingrafted in them dispositions
to move thus, or thus, as his infinite wisdom knew fittest, either for the
particular effect of each nature, or their combined effects to the whole,
according to which dispositions they cannot choose but work; and this is called
appetite, the natural inclination, and bent of each thing to produce those
effects, which either are agreeing to its self, or the public good.

Sect. 5.
Now these things are acted by them without their knowledge, only his who
directs them to this end. All things act according to Gods method, with an
innate appetite to accomplish his end, though without knowledge how they tend
to it.
As Scotus speaks, a great States-M^n gives diverse Officers dispatches of
Letters about his public ends; they carry the Letters, and, b^ing diligent in
their several charges, bring about the Design, and it may be said, their
diligence effected the Project: So here these things do, as it were, carry Gods
Letters, go on his Errands, and although they know not what they do, yet they,
by their acting according to that method he disposes them in, bringing those
mighty works of wisdom to pass, which we observe are done by them; or as you
discern in a Clock, which being made artificially, and kept in motion,
distinguishes the hours of the day to us; the hand moves to one or two a
Clock, and, when it comes thither, it makes such a noise, which speaks the hour
of the day; the Clock moves, and moves to this end, to strike and tell the time
of the day, but yet the Clock thinks not of the hour, but moves to that
purpose; so is it in these inferior things, they move like a Clock in their
order, and the Maker of them aimed them at such or such an effect, they move to
it themselves, not knowing what they do, and move to that end is designed them,
and certainly as when we see a Clock move in such a Method, and produce such
effects, as are beyond the reach of such dull things as Iron and Brass, which
are the Materials, we are sure that there was some wiser head in the
contrivance and ordering of it: so certainly, when we discern in these
creatures acts of a higher and more excellent condition then their nature can
produce, constantly acted by them, we cannot choose but perceive that great and
powerful wisdom and providence of God in their operations, which we should
not forget to consider punctually; therefore to his Argument we say, that these
things have an appetite to actions, or such objects, not a knowledge of them;
an appetite they have, for nothing moves but by its appetite, unless forced,
this appetite is the bent of its Nature to this or that; this is not out of
knowledge in its self, but in God who so disposed it; in its fall it is barely
that natural inclination which God has given to each thing, and, in some
cases, may be called instinct, and is d^scerned both in averseness and
inclinations, so that heavy bodies, out of this regard, move downwards, and
light upwards, having such inclinations naturally in them; but being disposed
by a greater wisdom, and if they have any contrary motion, that is forced,
which appears because these, upon the remove of obstacles, when they come to
themselves, retreat, like rivers into their own channels, by natural motions
into their own places, as has been showed; so then both, that all natural
bodies have appetite, appears; and likewise how this in the wisest and the most
excellent method, which may be, is in them, although their own Reason guide
them not to it, but that infinitely wise Reason of their Maker.

This, as I conceive, he writes as an introduction to this Chap. of
Imagination; but how it conduces to his design I see not; what follows, comes
a little closer.

CHAP. IX.
Of motion ceasing, dreams, decaying sense, imagination, memo^y, experience,
etc.

Sect. 1
HE begins with that refuted axiom, when a body is once in motion, it moves
(unless something else hinder it) eternally, and whatsoever hinders it, cannot
in an instant, but by degrees, extinguish it. The rule he gives in his first
part has been already overthrown, and his instance, which he u^geth for
illustration from perturbed water, being but a particular instance in one only
example, cannot be of force to draw a general conclusion from it, according to
any rules of logic; but if it could be, it is so far from proving his
conclusion, that it clearly ovetthrows it; for let it be inqu^red, why the
water, after that the winds cease at any time, gives over rolling, or, as his
instance is in the 3. Chap. of Humane Nature, why, after it is put into motion,
the standing water gives over motion; How standing water, put in motion,
recover^th rest.
The Answer cannot be made from any external thing, but only from its self,
that standing water, being a heavy body, works out his enemy motion, and by
degrees gets its rest, so that the water, its own self, produces its own rest
after motion; and for that other piece, that this stop is not in an instant,
although in that instance he gives, the phrase he uses is proper enough to
say, the ^i^derance is by d^grees, because nature has to do with an enemy, a
violent motion, which cannot be forced away, but by degrees; yet in natural
motions we may find it, either when a heavy body falls down, the further it
goes, the swifter it moves, and yet stops upon the sudden, when it comes to the
place of its rest; So likewise in that other instance, when the Bladder
ascends, the stop is in that instant it gets upon the top of the water; For
although all motion is in time, unless generation and corruption, (say the
Philosophers) yet the terms of motions are in instant, like those times by
which they are measured, as must needs appear evident.

Sect. 2.
Then he comes to apply this illustration of his rule to the business in hand,
page 5. I must now reckon by pages, so also (says he) it happens in the
motion, which is made in the internal parts of a man, How dreams a^e imp^operly
assimilated to it when ceasing.
then when he sees dreams, etc. for after the object is removed, or the eye
shut, we still retain an image of the thing seen, though more obscure then when
we see it.) Here observe how strangely he joins together seeing and dreaming,
as if seeing were a relick of sense, not sense, or a result out of it, as
dreaming is; but wherein can we find the convenience betwixt the motion of the
water, which stays a little while after the stone is stopped, and this remaining
of the Image? that motion of sense is nulled, and therein a quiescence of that
act; but as in all other Causes, which are not necessary to the preservation as
well as the producing their effects, so here, when the cause is gone, the
effect remains, the Image apprehended in sense, and then it has no other
convenience with that Motion, then any other Cause.

Sect. 3.
I r^j^ct not his Etymology, but deny his Deduction, Therefore (says he)
Imagination is nothing but decaying Sense; Im^gin^tion som^hing more t^en
dec^y^ng sense.
For although Imagination may be derived from Image, yet it is something
besides sense in its full notion, for sense is the mere judgment upon a present
Object, but Imagination works upon an absent; every Sense judges of a
particular sensative Object; so sight of Colors, hearing of Sounds, etc. and
no other but Fancy, (so here I involve the common sense with it, because he
excludes it, and I will multiply no controversy) judges of all senses, and
distinguishes them: This is visible, this Audible; yea, conjoynes them
together, and makes a Composure, sometimes for pleasure, sometimes for grief of
diverse of them, which sense cannot do, sight cannot judge, or act any way upon
sounds, or the ear upon colors, as is evident, a deaf man (though seeing)
cannot hear, yet, if ever he did hear, his fancy can imagine sounds.

So that imagination must needs be something besides decaying sense, which
operates where, and when Sense cannot, and is an act upon that which is the
relick of Sense; when Sense has done its work, there remains the Species which
the Object sent forth, and upon this Species the power of imagination works its
proper operations. Decaying Sense supposes Sense to be, but imagination works
when Sense is not, as upon Colors; when the man, that has seen, is blind
afterward, there is not the sense of seeing, but there is in that man an
imagination of colors, which he has, but cannot now see: So, in the dark, men
imagine colors, but can see none. I conclude therefore, that imagination is
something beside sense, which exists when sense fails.

Sect. 4.
He goes on. Memory no decaying sense, the act of Sensation being wholly p^st.
[ The decay of sense in man (says he) waking, is not the decay of the motion
made in sense, but an obscuring of it:] This I apprehend most untrue; for when
the Organ cease to judge, that motion which he calls sense, cease, and is
no longer; but those Species lie locked up in the Memory, and there is no act of
sensation concerning them, no not a decayed one. That Philosophy, His
illustration from the Suns light, obscuring that of the Stars, inc^ng^uous.
which he delivers concerning the Sun and the Stars, to illustrate this by, I
grant, that the Stars do emit and send forth their Light when the Sun shines,
but the excess of the Suns Light obscures that of the Stars; yet his
Application of it to this purpose is utterly vain; for there both the Objects
work, like Natural Agents, according to their utmost, and the greater by its
force masters the less; but here, in our business, the Object is removed, or
the Organ, and there is no operation of one upon the other at all, the species
being crept within the Organ, the eye cannot judge of it; and the object or
Organ, being diverted, or indisposed* cannot produce such an act any longer; it
is as if the Stars were removed out of the Heaven, not shining with the Sun; so
that we fancy colors in the dark, when no strength of another Object, more
powerful, does work upon our sense; and sometimes in the dark we do not employ
our Imaginations about colors, and yet in that dark we have no vehement Object
to obscure our fancy; so that it is not the suppression or weakening of sense,
by another Object, which makes us not see, but the cessation of sense, by the
removal of either Organ, or Object, one from another. And again we may observe,
that although the Sun shine, and the Objects external move never so powerfully,
yet the fancy is busied about some internal conceit, or other things absent,
which could not be, if only the vehement strokes from the object did produce
this act; for then that being, the fancy should likewise be.

Sect. 5.
After this weak Discourse he draws a conclusion thus: [ From whence it
follows, that the longer the time is, after the sight or sense of any object,
the weaker is the imagination.] This has some Truth in it, but is not
absolutely true; for many instantly upon sight, Extent of time does not always
weaken the imagination.
or hearing of a thing, have no apprehension of it, as we say, it comes in at
one ear, and goes out at another; men carelessly taking notice of it, like a
thing not heeded, or cared for, lose it presently; we conceiving the memory,
like a Box which keeps these Images, may apprehend attention like a Key to it,
which locks them up in that Box. Or, apprehending the memory like wax, we may
imagine attention like that force which presses these Images into it; but,
without attention, any sensitive object, though discerned, is lost immediately,
and does not stay for time to weaken or wear it out; when, contrariwise, it
often happens, that a thing long time forgot, and not thought on, may be
revived and quickened again, and remain more lively in the fancy then things of
a much later birth: as I remember Seneca speaks of himself, and I think most
men may find in themselves to be true; that the things, which he learned when
he was a child, did stick faster and fresher in his memory then those things
which he learned but a little before; so that although there may be some truth
in this; that often it happens out, that time wears out the sense or conceit of
a thing; yet, because there are many other things conducing to the preservation
and destruction of conceptions besides time, therefore this is not universally
true, as he proposes it, yet should not have been censured by me, but because
it seems to conduce to the illustration of what went before, which was an
Error not to be swallowed down.

Sect. 6.
I let pass what is between, and come to the upshot; [ This decaying sense
(says he) when we would express the thing it self, (I mean fancy its self)
we call Imagination.]

This that he calls decaying sense, I confess we call Imagination, but I have
showed it not to be sense, therefore not decaying sense. [But (says he) when
we would express the decay, and signify that the Sense is fading, old and
past, we call it Memory.]

His language confuse.
Here are d^vers words, of most distinct nature, hudled together, to confound
the Reader, ( old and past) many things are now past, yet not old; and those
past things, although but just now, are remembered, although not old. Then,
says he, [ Imagination and Memory are one thing, which for diverse
considerations has diverse Names: Imagination and Memory not one and the same
thing
] I deny that they are the same thing, and prove it thus:

Sect. 7.
They who have diverse acts which cannot be performed by each other, are not the
same thing, (for powers are distinguished by their Acts and Objects) but
imagination and memory are such; therefore they are not the same.

The major has its proof and illustration already; the minor shall be thus
confirmed; first imagination is busied about, and acts things which come not
into the reach of memory, as ^oyning two things together, a horse and a man, it
makes a centaure; this presently after he applies to imagination, which he
calls compounded imagination; now these two, although in their parts they were
discerned by sense before, and wrapped up in the memory, yet conjoined together,
having been never in the sense, cannot be in the memory; unless after they
were framed by the fancy the sensitive memory, but are the fruits of
imagination only; so likewise we may say, that there are many things in the
memory, which are not imagined when they are in the memory, as thus: The memory
is like a Book, in which those things, which are attentively perceived by
sense, are by that attention ingraved or locked up, as was before expressed, or
written in it; imagination is that internal eye which reads this book, and
sometimes reads one word, sometimes another: Now as it happens out, that there
are many things in the book which the eye sees not, yea, it cannot see all
things at once; so it is in the memory, it is impossible that the Fancy should
read half those things which are writ in the Memory; many things are there
which cannot be looked upon all at once, and, perhaps, sometimes will never be
fancied again or imagined, yet are in the Memory; and therefore certainly,
where there are so distinct acts and Objects, the things themselves are
distinguished; for we never say a man imagines any thing, of which he has not
an actual conception; nor that he remembers any thing by a sensative Memory,
of which he has formerly had no sense; so that those are as much
distinguished, in and by their Acts and Objects, as any two Faculties can be.

Sect. 8.
What he says presently after, [ That much memory, or memory of many things,
is called Experience, What memory it is that makes Experience.
] is not true in those general terms which he proposes; for Memory of many
things makes not Experience, but Memory of many things alike; so that he that
shall remember that fire burnt his hand, water washed it; that this lump of lead
felt heavy; teat Bladder of Air Light, makes not an Experimental conclusion,
from such remembrances, of either heat, or weight, or lightness; but when he
shall find that this Air, and all he meets with, this Lead, and many others are
such, then he has Experience, and by Experience he knows, that it is so with
all other; if he shall reply and produce common language, that we usually say,
that we had once Experience of such or such a passage; and therefore one trial
and sense, with remembrance of it, makes an experience. I answer: That
experience in a late way of acceptance is so used, for a particular
apprehension with remembrance; but because experience is the mother of
knowledge, and one Swallow assures us not of a Summer, nor does one Conception
give us the certainty of any Science; therefore the proper way of taking
experience is from the particular knowledge of many individuums of the same
nature; and in that sense he must take it, because else in vain he defined it
the Memory of many things, and should have rather said, It is the remembrance
of any thing: And yet give me leave to interpose my conceit, which is, that
Experience is not rightly termed Memory of one thing, or many, for Memory
contains many things at quiet in it, which yet are not experiments, until
applied to something else, either in speculation or practice; so that when we
call precedent examples for rules of future practice, we rub up our memories to
see what provision is in that Storehouse, to furnish us with directions in our
business at hand; and when we find things of like nature, these are called
Experiments. But this being, but a nominal discourse (as much of that which
follow*) I might have saved (as I shall do such things) and have suffered him
to beguile any man with it; for it is not material, whether true or false; only
I have hinted out the commonest way of speaking concerning experiments, and the
usefullest; I skip now to the 6 page of the 2. Chap.

CHAP. X.
The origin of Dreams, their variety, etc.

WHerein, impertinently I think to his maine purpose in that Chap. he enters
into a long discourse of Dreams, which, because it seems to squint at other
matters besides this in hand, I shall with brevity censure as most
unsatisfactory, and very erroneous; First, then he says there, [ That because
the Brain and Nerves are so benumbed in the sleep, as not easily to be moved by
the action of external Objects, there can happen in sleep no imagination and
therefore no dreams but what proceed from agitation of the inward parts of a
man's body.]

Sect. 1.
This I conceive erroneous, There have been prognostic dreams, and such cannot
be said to arise from the agitation of the inward parts.
in that latitude of terms which he uses; for, no doubt, there are many
Prophetic Dreams, concerning which the Scripture, both the Old and New
Testament, are full of Instance, as Genesis 40. the Butler and Baker had
Prophetic Dreams, so likewise Genesis 41. Pharaoh had a Prophetic Dream; such
another you may find Dan. 2. of Nebuchadnezzer. In the New Testament we may
observe in the 1. Chap. of S. Mat. v. 20. How an Angel appeared to Joseph in a
dream: so likewise S. Paul, Acts 16.9. Now these, and many more, which the
Scripture and story furnish us withal, and we are bound to believe, do show
us, that there are dreams which arise not from the agitation of the inward
parts, there being nothing in them that could prognostic any such thing; and
therefore this Universal Proposition, ( Th^re can be no dream but such) was a
fault not to be pardoned: He spoke much better in his Humane Nature, Cap. 3.
Number. 3. where he says, [ That the Causes of Dreams (if they be natural) are
the Actions or Violence of the inward Parts.] That Parenthesis ( if they be
natural) stopped a great gap, for these instances were not natural: It was much
he should correct the first Copy, making it more erroneous; error it had
before, but the rent in his Leviathan was made wider then in his first piece of
Humane Nature.

Sect. 2.
Error it had before, it was not true to say, that all natural dreams come from
the agitation of the inward parts; Solomon's opinion of dreams different from
Mr. Hobbes's.
for as the greatest Philosopher that was mere man, Solomon, expresses it,
Eccles. 5.3. A Dream comes through the multitude of business, not only when
the inward parts of a man are unquiet and violent, but even then when they are
in the best Composure; if a Man have his Fancy disturbed with earnestness of
thoughts about any business in the day, in the Night, when he takes his rest,
and both the Outward and Inward Senses are locked up by Sleep, his Fancy, being
opp^est with the Negotiations of the day, will busy its self about them in the
Night, as is most apparent; so that I remember, that the first Latin verses,
which I made, were made in my sleep, my thoughts, having run upon nothing else
in the day, busied themselves about them in the night; and you shall observe,
that a dog, used to hunting, barks in his sleep, with the like, earnestness and
uses actions of that nature; so that all natural dreams spring not from the
inward parts.

Sect. 3.
But in his 3. Chap. of Humane Nature, he offers at some reasons to prove his
conclusion, His reasons invalide.
and they are delivered at numb. 3. under the name of a Sign, thus: [ The
signs by which this appears to be so, are the differences of dreams (old men
commonly dream oftener, and have their dreams more painful then the young)
proceeding from the different accidents of man's body] Thus he; Old men's dreams.
I conceive this Instance mistaken; God be praised, I have lived to the age of
an old man, and I find it other, because I think my thoughts are more composed,
and by practice have made my passions less violent, and trouble my self w^^ h
less eagerness of business; but he says only, Old men commonly; and then I
say, this may be a sign, but not a certain one; yea, in natural things very
weak, for the course of Nature is constant, and is a sign that that proposition
of his, which is universally proposed, is not universally true; That many times
natural Dreams may arise from such inward causes, may be granted, because they
cooperate with the business, or thoughts, or passions, to which that man is
inclined; but most often they fail, when it is otherwise. What he further
disputes there to show, Constitutional dreams:
that such and such Constitutions do produce alike effects in the dreams of
those persons, I deny not, so it be not universally affirmed; for we read of
some men, who never dreamed; but in the same Numb. page 23. he proceeds to
another sign thus, [ Another sign that Dreams are caused by the Actions of the
inward parts, is the disorder and casual consequence of one conception, or
image to another. Fantastic dreams.
] I grant the conclusion that may be deduced hence, that is, that some Dreams
may arise hence, but deny the universality; for fancy not guided by reason, but
taking things as, by chance, they offer themselves out of that book of the
memory, may be as confused and disorderly, as any disturbance that comes from
the inward parts; yea, that confusion can hardly be conceived to come from the
inward parts; for suppose the predominant humor be Melancholy or choler; these
can suggest only such fancies, when, on a sudden, we may observe that Dreams
alter their conditions, and, sometimes in an instant, change from one fancy to
another, which that constant condition of the humor cannot promote; his
instance which he immediately gives, is not persuasive; thus: For when we are
waking, the antecedent thought or conception introduces and is cause of the
consequent (as the water follows a man's finger upon a dry and level Table) but
in Dreams there is commonly no coherence. Whence coherent, and incoherent,
dreams.
This Example seems to me most incongruous to this purpose; for the
understanding of man waking, and his fancy, are employed and set at work by his
will, which often interrupts and crosses the Chain of Consequences, and
imployes the Reason sometimes to seek out new reasons; other fingers to draw
water to its end; sometimes commands that finger to stop in the midst of its
progress; and so the finger, employed other where, is not followed by the
water; but in a Dream, if it arise from such a Physical cause, as many times it
does, a man may conceive rather why things, as they are linked together in the
Memory, should follow one another, when one is moved or raised up, because
there is no Superior Power to control that Consequence.

Sensitive creatures not intelligent; Their specific differences; Their
Sagacity.

Sect. 1
WEll, that we may part with a Gingle, the rest of his Fancies of dreams, and
his dreams of Fancies, I let pass for the present, guessing that what is
material in that Discourse, will conveniently be met with hereafter, and now
skip to the latter end of the Chap. 2. page 8. where he defines understanding
to be that imagination which is raised in every creature by word or voluntary
signs. I should have let this pass with the rest; Sensitive creatures become
acquainted with words, and signs, by custom or the suggestions of appetite, not
by understanding.
but that I am unwilling to betray that noble faculty of man's soul, his
Understanding (by which he is severed from, and exalted above all other
sublunary creatures) to that sordid condition of being only a sensual quality.
That we may the better apprehend this, we will first observe, that these words,
and other such signs which are apprehended by things merely sensual, although
the signs are voluntary, such as are imposed by any sign-maker, yet they are
perceived to have such signification by those Beasts or Dogs, and the like, not
in a rational or intellectual manner, but a natural; for custom merely, which
is another nature, and does the same way facilitate any thing to us as Nature
does, is the only cause of their apprehension of these; and this custom works
only by these two Principles, of a love to that which is profitable for them,
and a detestation of that is hurtful, which is nothing but that natural
appetite before spoken of; for when any of these find that by coming at such a
word he is rewarded; by disobeying such a menace, he provokes his own
punishment; he by custom being sensible of this, does accordingly: Nor do any
of those words signify any more to thar Beast but his pleasure or pain; he
understands not any simple term what it signifies, but only these two things;
and from these Principles they do not only listen to the words, but speak them,
as Parrots, without any understanding more then their belly, and by that you
may have Corvos Poetas. Now here is no understanding in these Acts, but almost
like a Tree, which if you use to keep bent, it will grow such; so these, being
used to the reward or punishment, upon such words, do apprehend them such, and
naturally follow or avoid them. But because there are some acts in these beasts
which have a nearer affinity with Reason then these he specifies, although I
have already written somewhat to this purpose, I will, for the further
satisfaction of the Reader, enlarge my self a little, and so pass on to other
things.

Sect. 2.
(...) specific souls, and signal differences distinguishing them each from
other.
As it is with man, who is one kind or species of Animals, that he has, besides
that general nature of a sensitive soul, another soul which distinguishes him
from other Animals; so likewise it is with the other species or kinds of
Animals, they must have some particular soul, or degree of a sensitive soul,
which may distinguish them from man, and one from each other; as the Canine or
doggish soul distinguishes a dog from a lion, a bear, a cat, a man. And each
of these (besides that general nature of a sensitve soul, in which they all
agree) must have some particular soul, or substantial difference in that soul,
by which each of these is distinguished from the rest: Now this, whatsoever it
is, (which I find not named by Philosophers) but whatsoever this is, it must be
the Author of those actions which belong to each; and these peculiar fancies,
which do appear in some with a great resemblance of wit, of ingenuity; of
docibility, of stupidity and blockishnesse in others; and this quality, as
natural, is propagated throughout the whole kind or species, failing in very
few particulars, in some degrees only. And when the peculiar property of any
Animal advances the condition of it to act like those of men, this in them is
called by Philosophers (as I remember) Sagacity, and will appear in diverse
actions of Elephants, Their Sagacity.
Dogs, Birds, which fill the stories of those who write their lives; but all
these are wrought not by reason, but by that principle of Nature, which
dictates, Eschew evil, and get good, and is directed by the several kinds of
Sagacity, which in every kind of Animals has some addition to the general
condition of a sensitive creature, but attains not the height of understanding;
but because it may be objected here, how can we discern understanding in man,
concerning these simple terms, from that of a beast? I will answer this by
experience; for man understands these simple terms in their proper notion, but
a beast only in general; I have seen a dog running fiercely at a horse, a
woman rebuke him by this Word (Out) which, in its genuine signification,
imports Go abroad; and if that Word (Out) had been used to a man, he would have
answered, I am out; but the Dog, knowing it only in general to be a phrase of
Rebuke, ceased from his barking, and went his way, although other more menacing
words, by other men which were present, prevailed not with him, they being, as
it is likely, such words which had not been used in his ordinary correction,
did not, yet this which, likely, was the Word which had brought him smart, did
prevail, to the appeasing him. Perhaps some man, not satisfied in this, may
instance in some of those famous Stories of Beasts, which seem to express an
apprehension more particular; but I believe, if they were examined, there can
be no other further knowledge of simple terms, then this of pleasure and pain
to his particular, which may be easily conceived to arise out of that Sagacity
which is in every kind of Animals, in several and distinct ways. What he adds,
that, understanding which is peculiar to man, is the understanding not only his
will, (this should be a Parenthesis, and a most unnecessary one) but his
conceptions and thoughts, by the Sequel and Contexture of the names of things
into Affirmations and Negations. I can agree with him, that this is peculiar to
man, and yet as much may be cavil'd against this, as that went before; and the
sagacious actions of many Beasts would persuade us as soon, that they make
Propositions and syllogise, as that they apprehend, understanding the simple
terms.

NOTES UPON THE Twelfth Chapter of Leviathan.
CHAP. 12.
Of Religion, the feigned Gods, Ghosts, and the soul of Man.

HAving done with his Two first Chapters, for this present, I will pass over
his Third, concerning the consequence and train of Imaginations, in which are
many things very obnoxious to Censure; his fourth of Speech likewise I pass
over for the present, and his Fifth with his Sixth, which is nothing but an
Exposition of easy terms, which have been better discoursed upon by a hundred
several persons; and I skip to his Twelfth, --

Which begins Page, 52. and is entitled, Of Religion, wherein, as in many other
places, he is to blame not to express what Religion is, that so it might
appear how pertinent and reasonable his D^scourse is, which if he had done, he
might have spared much which he has written, or otherwise disposed it. That I
may proceed therefore the more confidently, take the definition of Religion
which is most received, which is: --

Sect. 1.
That Religion is a virtue, by which Men give God the worship and honor due to
him: Religion defined.
And this is the reason why Divines do make Religion a part of Justice, and
handle it as a Species or part of it, though an imperfect one; because Justice
gives to every one as much as is his due exactly; Why reckoned among the duties
of justice.
but that cannot be done by man to God; and therefore it is imperfectly a part
of Justice; but yet because in Religion we, after our weak and imperfect
manner, do it, therefore it is reckoned among the duties of Justice: we do by
it give God worship and honor; Worship, as the supreme; Honor, as the most
excellent; Those, who are over us, we worship as our Governors, although they
have not Excellencies to be honored for; Those which are our Inferiors, or
equals, if they have Excellencies in them, and extraordinary parts, we honor,
although not worship them. But these two Excellencies of perfection, and
supremacy of Authority over us, being acknowledged by every religious person to
be in God, he renders him both those duties in the highest measure, as in
Justice is due to him for them. Thus we briefly discern what is the Subject he
writes of; let us now consider what he writes of it.

2. First, he says rightly, that [ there is no cause to doubt that the seed of
Religion is only in man] for certainly, The seed of Re^igion in man only,
because rational.
the Seed of Religion is the assurance that God is infinitely excellent, and
has the highest, and most unquestionable authority over us by the right of
Governing us. This apprehension I conceive to be the seed of Religion, and this
can be in no Creature which has not reason and understanding, as Man has:
for, certainly, if they have not understanding to apprehend those divine
excellencies, they cannot have Religion: and unless they have liberum
arbitrium (which without understanding they cannot have) their actions can be
no more pleasing to God then the fire pleases him when it burns.

3. He labors to give reasons for his Conclusion, others then that I have set
down with this Phrase, First, Mr. Hobbes's reasons invalid and his discourse
impertinent.
Second; but look upon them, they are so incomposed and disjoynted, that none
of them can produce this Conclusion, That only Man has the Seed of Religion;
But in Page 53. in the beginning he urges an Argument from the Chain and
Origination of Causes, acknowledged to be of an absolute force for the
Causation of a God, and so of the apprehension of the Object to which our
Religion is directed. But in all that discourse, let a man consider, whether it
be any way pertinent to Religion any otherwise, then to show, there is a God,
and to illustrate that saying of his, that fear made the heathen Gods.

Sect. 4. His opinion of the feigned God, invisible Agents, Ghosts etc.

4. He says [That fear gives occasion to feign as many Gods, as there are
Men that feign them: And for the matter or substance of the invisible Agents
so fancied, they could not, by natural cogitation, fall upon any other conceit,
but that it was the same with the Soul of man, and that the soul of man, was of
the same substance with that which appears in a Dream to a man that
sleeps, or in a Looking-glass to one that is awake: which men not knowing
that such Apparitions are nothing else but Creatures of the fancy, think to be
real, and external substances, and therefore call them Ghosts, as the Latins
call them Imagines and umbrae, and thought them Spirits, that is, thin aeriall
bodies; and those invisible Agents, which they fear, to be like them, save
that they appear, and vanish, when they please. Thus far he. In which Period
are many strange and forced Expressions without any proof, or illustration.
Invisible Agents what.
I will touch them briefly, but first I must expound that Phrase used twice by
him, Invisible Agents; by that he must understand the false Gods of the
Gentiles, for the first Clause, that they conceited those false Gods to be of
the same nature with the soul of man, I yield, only more excellent; so was
every Demon esteemed, and so even those Heroes, which were from humanity, in
the esteem of Idolatrous men, exalted to a celestial excellency, thought of a
greater perfection then themselves had in their earthly condition; and that
they had influence, and power over these earthly things, and therefore had
Prayers and sacrifice offered to them. But then let us consider his Philosophy
concerning man's soul, he says, That these Idolaters, Mr. Hobbes sticks an
absurd opinion of man's soul undeservedly upon Idolaters.
who thought their Gods like man's soul, thought a man's soul was of the same
substance with that which appears in a Dream, or in a Looking-glasse] I am
persuaded he dreamt when he writ this, he did not so much as see it in any
glass in this world; and although it is too much to say, he never read it in
any book, (for his Book will witness, that many unexpected things are in Books)
yet I can say, that I never heard or read of any Idolater that ever had that
absurd opinion concerning the Soul. These two things are things of a very
little Entity, the meanest of Accidents, the one a Dream, the work of a
sleeping fancy; the other the apparition of a Looking-glass, the weak effect
of a poor Accident, Color, in which it produced it self in a most feeble and
weak condition. Contrariwise, the soul of man is the most excellent and
substantial part in the most excellent Creature man, the Author of all those
noble effects which the wit or industry of man can attain unto; and all this
affirmed by these Idolaters in their Philosophical Books.

Sect. 5.
But he seems to give a reason for it thus [ which men not knowing that such
apparitions are nothing else but Creatures of the fancy, think to be real and
external substances; and therefore call them Ghosts, as the Latins call them
Imagines and Umbrae] I cannot conceive to what this Relative (Which) looks, His
discourse of Spirits and Ghosts etc. too perplexed.
by the preceding words it should be referred to the Dreams or Image in a
Looking-glass, but by the consequent words it seems to look further, to the
Invisible Agents, for no man was ever so foolish to think that Dreams, or the
Image in a Looking-glass, are real substances; nor yet is it true of one piece
of them, which is the Image in the Looking-glass, to say it is a Creature of
the fancy; for the Image is there, whether the fancy conceit it so, or no. But
then to take this word, Which, as it relates to the invisible Agents, which the
words following implie [ and therefore call them Ghosts] no man ever called the
image in a Looking-glass a Ghost: now then in this Sense, although a strange
perturbed one, he says, that men not knowing these Gods of theirs, those
invisible Agents to be nothing but Creatures of the fancy called them Ghosts; I
believe, if they had known them to be Creatures of the fancy, they would not
have so called them Ghosts, as the Latins call them Imagines and Umbrae:
Certainly I am persuaded, that the Latins did never call their Gods Imagines
or Umbrae. This is a most perplexed discourse, I know not how to make sense of
it, nor I believe he himself, for mark he goes on, [ and thought them Spirits;
that is, thin aerial bodies.] Consider the relative Them, what does he mean by
it? Their Gods, those Invisible Agents? That cannot be for the following words
[ and these Invisible Agents, which they feared to be like them.] Now if by
them before he meant these Invisible Agents, he could not say that they thought
them like themselves; but for the other mentioned before, the Dreams or Images
in a Glass, no man ever thought to be Spirits or aerial bodies. But he puts a
difference betwixt Spirits and Ghosts, or Imagines, or Umbrae, or I know not
what [ how that they apaear and vanish when they please] and it seems the
Ghosts did not: this I believe is not delivered by any, I am confident by none
of his enemies, that are studied in School and Vniversity-Learning; but thus
he builds Castles in the air, and I was about to say, fights against them; but
he leaves them upon these weak foundations, and never casts a Trench, or plants
a Battery against them, with any solid Argument; it may be he throws a stone,
an ill word sometimes, but not the least attempt to prove what he says, that
ever I read. He proceeds with a discourse, from which I withhold my hand till
I come to his Treatise of Angels, which will administer occasion of fuller
censure, and here I will leap over to Page 52.

CHAP. XIII.
The opinion of Ghosts, Ignorance of second causes, Devotion to what we fear,
taking things casual for Prognostiques, mistaken for seeds of Religion. Of the
Sybils, and their Oracles.

IN which he sets down four things, wherein consists the natural seed of
Religion, Opinion of Ghosts, Ignorance of second Causes, Devotion toward what
we fear, and taking things Casual for Prognostiques.] Certainly here is a
foundation laid for Atheism,

Sect. 1.
It is impossible that so goodly a tree, as Religion, should grow out of such
rotten and contemptible seeds as these. First, I observe here, that these, he
calls seeds, Mr. Hobbes sowes ambiguous seeds to produce false and true Religion.
he puts not for the immediate, but remote causes of Religion: the immediate
Cause (to consent what I can with his Phrase) or the body of the tree, which
supports these glorious Acts, is the assurance that there is a GOD; these four
Seeds (as he calls them) do but produce that belief in us, and that very
weakly, not able to make a man forsake all for God, which Religion must do.
Another observation may be, that he does not make these conceits of his to be
the seeds of false Religion only, but even of true; for so presently he
discourses, that these seeds produced either true or false Religion, according
to their culture; so that the culture of Abraham, Moses, our blessed Savior,
was but a husbanding of these seeds; and therefore these words must needs be
taken in that Indefinite sense they are expressed, that these are the seeds of
all Religion. I will consider them apart, and first the Opinion of Ghosts is a
seed of Religion.

Sect. 2.
All the Opinion of Ghosts, The opinion of Ghosts could not introduce the
assurance that there is a God.
which he expresses in the former part of this Chapter, he makes to be an
Error; now for Error to be a s^ed of Truth, was never heard of before; an ill
tree cannot bring forth good fruit, nor ill seed a good tree; Error the
greater growth it has, the greater is the Error, but it never grows into
Truth. Again, in the seventh Chapter he makes Opinion to be a very weak
assurance, as indeed it is, although his description of it is weak in that
place, but the assurance that there is a God, is the greatest that may be; and
therefore not to grow out of such a seed. Thirdly, consider, that although
there can be no assurance of God without an assurance of a Ghost or Spirit,
because God is expressed in Scripture to be a Spirit, yet the belief and
assurance of God cannot grow out of the Opinion of Ghosts; for although the
Opinion of Ghosts has many reasonable and probable arguments in Nature to
induce it, which prevailed with many Philosophers to persuade them, that there
were such things; yet the Arguments for them are not of like force with those
which evince, there is a God; and therefore the assurance of God may introduce
and be a seed of the Opinion of Ghosts; but the opinion of Ghosts, which is
less certain, and less evident, cannot introduce it. He brings no manner of
proof for what he speaks, and in his Catalogue of those Deities which this
opinion should produce, Page 55. He names Chaos, Ocean, Planets, Men, Women,
and other things which have no likeness with Ghosts or Spirits, although his
Demons and some others have. Now although the opinion of Spirits may persuade
a Religion toward those things which were thought Spirits; yet it could never
invite, but would cross and oppose those, Religions which were paid to
corporeal things; for by all men, who have writ of Spirits, both Christian,
and others, Spirits are thought to have a more God like power in them then
Bodies; and therefore the opinion of them could not introduce the other.

Sect. 3.
Ignorance of second causes apter to produce Atheism then Religion.
His second seed is ignorance of second Causes, a most unhappy and unreasonable
speech. Ignorance the Mother of Religion; Ignorance of second Causes cannot
make a man acknowledge the first, Romans 1.20. S. Paul says, The Invisible
things of Him (that is, of God) from the Creation of the world, are clearly
seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal Power and
Godhead. This understanding of eternal Power and Godhead is the foundation and
ground of Religion, and this was visible, although not in its self, yet in the
things that are made, the second Causes; so that not the ignorance, but the
knowledge of the second Causes, like Jacobs ladder, leads, us from one to
another, step by step, until we ascend to the highest and first Cause. This he
himself acknowledges before; but as he often does, so he now forgot what he
had said. Ignorance of second Causes that they are second, and mistaking them
for first may make a man think them Gods, and so turn a Religion to them; but,
as may appear at the bottom of the preceding Page 53. he understands the
Ignorance of the Causation of second Causes, which, without doubt, is so far
from bringing in Religion, that it is apt to produce Atheism, and an opinion,
that the world is governed by chance* not by Providence: So that, as for his
first, I deny it to be a Seed of Religion, that is, the opinion of Ghosts; so
for this Second, the Ignorance of second Causes, I affirm that is an enemy to
Religion, stopping the Soul from ascending up to Heaven, by breaking the lowest
step of that Ladder which is fixed on Earth.

Sect. 4.
His third Seed is Devotion toward what we fear. Devotion to what we fear
rather a fruit, then seed, of Religion.
That fear, Timor Reverentialis, may be a seed, the fomenter and cherisher of
Religion, yea an act of Religion, I do not doubt: but that that ugly sordid
fear, which he speaks of, as appears in the bottom of Page 52. is not to be
imagined; for the first fear arises out of the knowledge and apprehension we
have of the Excellency of God; but this second fear, he speaks of, out of
Ignorance of Causes. (Because men know there are Causes (says he) of every
thing, but know not those causes, therefore they impute their good or evil
fortune to some invisible Agent,) This ignorance o^ Causes must needs be
understood of second Causes; for ignorance of the first Cause can never make a
man worship the first, nor impute the production of things to him; It is true,
the ignorance of some Attributes, as his goodness, may make a Maniche think
there is an ill God; and the same ignorance may produce almost as ill an
opinion in others, that God is the Author of the evil of sin; the one, not
apprehending his internal goodness, conceives God evil in himself: the other,
not apprehending his Goodness in operation, his Benignity makes him do and
produce that is ill; but the ignorance of him, as a first Cause, can never
introduce a Religion to him; But then take this ignorance of causes to be the
ignorance of the Causation of second Causes, we cannot conceive how that should
breed a fear of an invisible Agent, as he terms it, unless it be that god
Fortune, which the Poet derideth: Te facimus Fortuna Deum; coeloque locamus.
And worthily; for there can be nothing more contradictory then the Providence
of God, and the Blindness of Fortune: Now when men cannot find the Chain of
Causes, which produce the effects they discerned, and cannot perceive how they
depend upon the first Cause, as they cannot who discern not the second, they
must needs have that doubt or fear, that they are acted by Fortune, and all
things fall alike to all, without either being rewards or punishments, Rods or
Scourges, etc. And therefore is so far from introducing of Religion, as it
leads to Atheism. But it is not said, that this fear, but the Devotion to what
we fear, is the Seed of Religion; I could have wished that among other his
expositions of words, he had put down what he means by Devotion, but he has
not: Consider then, the sense of it is, Voto decernere, to decree a thing to
another, by a vow; so that when one devotes a thing to another, he then decrees
it in a sacred manner to be his. Now then Devotion to what we fear, is
decreeing some thing to it by way of Vow; Devotion then to what we fear, if
that we fear be God, is not a seed, but a fruit and act of Religion; for
Religion is not only, as he, not vainly only, but wickedly, and profanely,
defines Chap. 6. page 26. ( Fear of Power invisible feigned by the mind, or
imagined from tales publicly allowed,) but it is the worship due to God, and
this worship is, when it is, as it ought to be, accompanied and attended with
reverential fear and awe of that Infinite Excellency; and this makes us devote
our selves in all holy ways to his service; but if these things, we fear, be
less then God, although we may devote our selves, or any thing is ours, to
them, it is not Religion, nor in any way does it introduce Religion. So that if
the thing, we fear, have in it the estimation of Divine Excellency, Devotion
to it is an Act of Religion, not a Seed; if it have not that estimation, it is
an act of some Reverence, or other habit, but no way a Seed of Religion, for a
Seed precedes the fruit, and introduces it, which this does not.

Sect. 5.
His fourth and last Seed is taking things casual for Prognostiques. In all
these, A taking things casual for Prognostiqu^s, no seed of the ta^^e Religions.
according to his scornful derision, rather then definition of Religion, he
makes ^he Seeds of it nothing but Error and Folly; no wonder that the Tree
should be so weak and rotten, when the very Seeds are corrupted.

This Seed he applies Page 56. only to the Religion of the Gentiles, although
in general, with the rest, it was uttered of all Religion, and so expressed as I
have showed: Indeed if he should speak it of the true Religion, it were most
impiously wicked, and would imply, that the very Prophecies in the old and new
Testament (which were a true and real Seed of Religion) were but casual
things, and not foreseen by God, and revealed to his Prophets; But I will take
him in the best sense that he can be taken, that the taking things casual for
Prognostiques, were a seed of those false Religions, and then I say first for
the Oracles, men did not therefore believe that there were Gods, and so worship
them, because of their oraculous sentences; but because of their belief, that
these were Gods, they were confident that they spoke truth, and so expounded
them according to the event, whatsoever it was. There have been Sibyls that
prophesied of our Savior.
For the Sibyls I might say the like (if they were such as the other) and
although he imagined these but feigned, whose Copies we have, yet, that there
were such, is evident in Story, and that they prophesied such things as could
be applied to none but our Savior, which were not to be interpreted Casual
events, but Prognostiques real; and although the belief in them, for a great
while, was a fruit of Religion, for because men believed they were
Prophetesses, and inspired by God, therefore they believed what they said; yet
afterward, as it haps in Trees, so did it with their Prophesies, that, which
was the fruit of one, was the seed of another; so these Prophesies, which were
a fruit of Religion, before were a seed of Religion in planting the Christian
Church, and often made use of by the Fathers an Argument against the Idolatrous
world, to persuade them to Christianity; but it was not, as he speaks, a
taking Casual things for Prognostiques. For the other things, he there reckons
up, I guess them, for the most part, unhappy illusions, and the fruit of
Superstition, not the seeds of Religion; or else mistakes of second Causes,
which in no sense conduce to Religion, as Horoscopy, Presages, and the like.

CHAP. XIV.
What the seed of Religion. Concerning the chain of causes. What of God to be
known. Of finite and infinite. The first mover. The sound doctrine of Eternity,
etc.

Sect. 1.
CErtainly the sole immediate seed of Religion, is the assurance that there is
a God of an infinite excellency governing all the world; for therefore men
perform Religion to him; The sole immediate seed of Religion an innate
principle.
but that which propagates this naturally, is first without doubt an innate
principle, born in, and with a man, which naturally every man has as soon as
he has reason; and there never was Nation, or society of men, found in the
world, which denied it. It is true, there may be now and then, by the
suggestions of the Devil, a man found, that with malicious reason has
labored to diswade this Principle; but that is not material; There are Errors
and Monsters in the moral part of man, as well as in his natural: This
Gentleman, who has by nature the sight of Colors, and ability to discern
them, yet has studied reasons to make men believe he sees none. There is
nothing so abhorring to Reason that malicious Reason does not oppose; but such
a truth as this, Quod ubique semper, et ab omnibus, has been held, cannot be
other then natural; and whereas he can show one man breaking this rule, I can
show him a hundred that have no use of reason at all, and a thousand that have
lost it; so that as such a man, as he, is a rarer sight then those; so he may
well be reckoned amongst the worst of fools and madmen; and therefore the
Psalmist, Psalm. 14.1. says, The fool has said in his heart, there is no God;
and he himself in this Chapter, page 58. affirms, That an opinion of a Diety
and Powers invisible, and supernatural, can never be abolished out of humane
nature, but that new Religions may be made to spring out of them: So that this
Seed is so naturally and firmly rooted in man's heart, that it cannot be
extirpated by any thing, that does not likewise with it extirpate reason.

Sect. 2.
To be proved from the chain of causes.
But because although this is natural, yet some men, by the wickedness of
malicious reason, have endeavored to wither it, therefore other Children of
Nature have endeavored to cherish this root by watering it with the strength
of invincible reasons, drawn from the chain of Causes, which suppose a seed
or a tree first, and that first to be created, not generated; for if generated,
then it requires a preceding tree, or seed, and then that was not first; and so
in all the effects in the world. But these men pretend an Eternity in the
world, An eternity of the world, with an infinity of causations, why not to be
admitted.
and so, in the propagation and causation of Natural things, that there may be
an infinity of these causations from one to another, which is almost impossible
to be conceived; for then there should be an Infinite number of Causes, which
cannot be, for then Robert, who is now born, should have no more Paternities or
Precedings in causes then Adam had; for if there should be an infinite Number
of Causes preceding Adam, then there can be no addition to it; for what can
receive addition, is not Infinite, it has a bound to it, and then all the
Causations from Adam to Robert are nothing; for if you should imagine in these
five or six Thousand years there may have been so many hundred generations
more then were before, I can answer no, the other was infinite; for should you
fill this sheet with Ciphers, and head them with the figure of one, I can make
all these Ciphers nines, and the figure of one Nine, and make nine Millions of
such sheets; and yet all this, in respect of Eternity, will be not so much as
one unite to all this; and six or seven hundred thousand were nothing being
added; because whatsoever you add to Roberts number of Fathers, I can add a
thousand times as many to Adams; and therefore Nature, that abhors
impossibilities, abhors likewise infinites of Numbers, and, by consequence, of
Causations eternally; for a man to say, this Eternity is a part ante, and not
a part post, is a contradiction; for although there may be some imagination of
a thing, which, having a beginning, may have no end, but exist eternally,
because it may be created with eternal Principles, and the Number infinite is
not presently existing, nor ever shall be; for whenever you reckon, you shall
have a finite time to reckon from, although it were ten thousand Millions of
years hence, or whenever; yet there can be nothing, without a beginning,
eternal a part ante, but must needs have eternal Principles, which no time can
corrupt, for if time could corrupt it, as suppose ten thousand years, or a
thousand times so many, fix any time, it had been corrupted before this, or
else it was not eternal a part ante. And then to the second part, such a
person, he has actually an Infinite number of Causes, which cannot be; and
therefore these things must be created in some certain time: These, and many
more arguments, out of Metaphysiques, as that which the Philosophers call
Essential Subordination of Causes, as likewise many others, are such as of
which I may say, that they render the Proposition, There is a God, evidently to
be discerned by the Creatures, but, as Aegidius Romanus excellently speaks,
Sapientibus, this evidence is perceiveable only by wise men; from the
disquisition whereof they are not to be scared by the infinity of Gods essence,
because inaccessible to a finite Inquirer, A transition to Mr. Hobbes's Element
of Philosophy, etc.
as he plainly asserts it in his Element of Philosophy, etc. whither I will
make a transition, to enlarge this discourse, and clear what I have writ from
somewhat I find there opposite to my purpose.

Sect. 3.
In his said book of Philosophy de Corpore, Cap. 26. Page 236. having proposed
diverse questions about the World, he concludes at the bottom of that page and
the beginning of the next, Et haec omnia ab eo qui Philosophiam complecti
profiteretur universam determinanda essent, Somewhat of God, though infinite,
may be known.
si quantum quaerit, tantum sciri potest, est autem infiniti scientia finito
quaesitori inaccessibilis. Thus far he; And not without reason, no finite
understanding can grasp that which is infinite; yet, although we cannot
perfectly know that which is Infinite, we may know many things of it. Mr.
Hobbes himself, I dare say, does not know the essence of the Sun, yet there is
not the meanest person, which follows the Plough, but knows there is a Sun,
and many effects of the Sun, that he does send forth light, and heat, by which
the poor man is comforted. Mr. Hobbes his Argument, Therefore, because finite
things cannot know God as he is, we must know nothing of him, is weak. He
proceeds.

Sect. 4.
Whatsoever we men know, we have learned from our Phantasm; but there is no
Phantasm of that which is either Infinite in magnitude, or time, Neque enim
homo, says he, neiiher man, nor any thing that is not infinite, can have any
conceit of that which is infinite.) He said true in affirming, that what we
know, And that from Phantasms.
we have learned from our Phantasm; so although the soul of man have many
things in it which have no being in the world, as Chimera's, Utopia's,
Leviathans, and our Phantasmes are properly of things in the world; yet those
things which are in the understanding, and not in the world, are learned from
those Phantasmes, which are of things in the world; as thus, That man who
cannot behold the Sun in his own glory, and luster, yet seeing him behind a
thin Cloud, can learn from thence, that the Sun, who shines so glorious,
veiled, and hid from eyes by such a dark body, would have a strange high degree
of resplendent luster, if we could see him as he is: So we learn from
Phantasmes apparent, as the Apostle speaks, from visible things, to collect
many apprehensions of that which is of its self invisible, and not to be
perceived; and, having reduced one Conclusion, may collect from thence many
more; and men desirous to know God (as he, who desires knowledge, does) will
make such collections. The Prophet David there, in a most heavenly invective,
calls them not only fools, but beastly people, who do not so collect, Psalm.
94.8. Understand ye brutish among the People: and ye fools, when will ye be
wise? Mark; they were foolish, and brutish, because they did not make such
Collections. He that planted the Ear, shall he not hear, and he that formed the
Eye, shall he not see? Thus from one truth men may, and ought to enlarge their
talent to another, and learn, as Mr. Hobbes expresses, from Phantasmes. But I
like not so well what Mr. Hobbes adds; that there is no Phantasme of that whch
is Infinite; nor, what he further expresses; Neither man, nor any thing, that
is not Infinite, can have any conceit of that which is Infinite: To understand
which I shall take a little pains to explain the conceit of Finite and
Infinite,

Sect. 5.
Finite is the same to have bounds or limits, beyond which it cannot pass; The
conceit of fi^ite and infinite explained.
Infinite is that which has no bounds nor limits; and although, concerning
these terms, in the first sounding, a man would think that Infinite should
express a mere negation, as finite an affirmation; yet upon judgment of these
things, expressed by these terms, we shall find the clean contrary; for by
finite we understand non ultra, as much as hitherto, and no farther; but by
Infinite we apprehend such a vastness, to which we can always say ultra, that
there is further, there is somewhat beyond, and there must be something more.
And out of this regard, finite things must have a cause of their finite nature,
because whatsoever is bounded, is bounded by somewhat, but infinite can have no
cause, because unbounded or limited. These bounds or limits we may consider in
three things; in the essence of things, in their quantities, and in their
qualities: In their Essence, and so we consider all finite things to be this,
and no other; as a Tree is a tree, and not a Beast or Bird, nor another tree;
the being of it is bounded, and limited by that difference which constituted it
either in its specifical, or particular being; and whatsoever is the Cause of
that being, is that which limits that thing, and makes it thus finite in being.
But that which is infinite in essence has no bounds, no limits of that being;
it is all essence, without limitation, and, in a most eminent manner,
comprehends all being, without any negation. It is true, it is not finite, and
therefore it is not a Man, a horse, a dog, a tree, all which names do import a
restraint and confinement; but is the perfection of all these, so that no
perfection of any thing can be denied of that which is infinite essentially, to
say that this infinite is not that; Let us conceive a line infinite; imagine
such a thing; This line you cannot say it is a span, a foot, a yard, or mile
long, yet it contains in it all these measures, without their limitation; so
does an infinite being contain all beings without confinement, in a more
excellent and eminent manner. What I have spoken concerning that which is
infinite in essence, or being, may be applied to all other infinites in
immensity, in quantity; what is immense must be beyond all bounds of quantity;
it must have no limits, but contains eminently all quantities in it: so must
number be likewise, if there be any such, which I shall disprove (God willing)
hereafter: so must, in respect of duration, Eternity be; It must comprehend all
durations, and its self be without beginning and end; so must all Infinites, in
respect of quality, be, in regard of wisdom, of mercy, of power, comprehend
all those Acts of those qualities, which are in that which is finite, and
themselves be without all bounds and limits. H^v^ng thus explained what is
meant by infinity, let us return to that which occasioned this discourse [
neither man nor any thing which is not infinite (says he) can have any
conceit of that which is infinite] (conceptionem ullam) is his phrase.

Sect. 5.
What conceit may be had of infinite.
This I disprove; for although a man's understanding is finite, and cannot grasp,
or fully comprehend that which is infinite; yet it can lay hold on it, and
apprehend, though not comprehend it; although it cannot enclose the whole being
of that is infinite; yet he can discover that it is incomprehensible, and that
discovery will give him some conceit of that infiniteness; yea the very
knowledge of finite things will yield him some conceit of that is infinite: so
he, who travelleth in an enclosed Country, can sever those hedges from his
fancy, and can conceit what that Country would be, if those hedges and bounds
were removed; although he do not see them so removed; yet he can conceive what
manner of Country that would be, if they were removed. Men may conceive that
which neither is, nor ever was in the world, as an empty place, against which
he has disputed in his natural Philosophy (although many learned are of
opinion against him) and therefore had a conceit of it. Men may, and learned
men have expressed their opinions to be of an infinite thing which is not, that
is, of an infinite vacuity beyond the heavens, which give bounds to this
visible world, and therefore have a conceit of that infinite which they
dispute for; men have had a conceit, and, methinks, he is not far from it, that
this world has had an eternal being; and therefore they had a conceit of this
we call Eternity, which is an infinite duration; men have a conceit of infinity
of number; and therefore somewhere, in his Book of Philosophy (I have forgot
where) he most ingeniously expresses it, that if a man's hand were as active as
his head (or to this purpose) he might divide any quantity into infinite parts:
his head then is able to do it, and then he must needs have a conceit of his
own work; He spoke therefore too much when he said, no finite thing could have
any conceit of that is infinite; a conceit it may have, but an imperfect one;
and so I go on with him.

Sect. 6.
[ Neque si quis ab effectu quocunque] Neither (says he) if a man from any
effect to its immediate cause, and from thence to his more remote, and so
continually, shall ascend by a most right reasoning; yet he cannot proceed to
that which is Eternal, but, being tired, shall flag, at the last, and be
ignorant whether he can go further or no] Thus far he, an ingenuous and
handsome expression, I confess; but how true, will be examined.

And first, I hope Mr. Hobbes will not say, he is the wisest man that ever was
in the world; or that he only found out right reasoning (and yet he speaks
somewhat like this now and then) but, howsoever, because I write not only to
him, but to other men, and, I hope, he harh not gained an universal esteem of
such with the generality, I thus answer; There was never any sort of reasoning
men who denied an Eternity; An Eternity acknowledged by all of different
opinions.
for whether they held the world had a beginning, or no beginning, which all
did, and must do; those which held it had no beginning (as Aristotle, in my
judgment) held the world eternal; those which held it had a beginning from
Water, as Thales; or Air, as Anaximenes; or Fire, as Heraclitus; or from
Atoms, as Democritus, by chance meeting together in the great and infinite
Vacuum; not to lose time in confuting all, or any of these, which are most
absurd, (yet all these, that held it was principiated by these means, held
likewise that that Principle was eternal; so likewise Plato his Ideas and
Chaos were eternal.) Let us from the fact consider the manner in one or two
instances. If, with Democritus, we make the world constituted by Atoms, when
we resolve these mixed bodies into their principles, we come to their Elements,
then, with Democritus, those Elements may be resolved into their Atoms; by
Aristotle into their Principles, matter, form and privation; these Atoms,
according to Democritus, are Eternal; that matter, according to Aristotle; so
here is an eternity found; So likewise may be said of Air, Water, which are by
some imagined to be the Principles; or Chaos, and Ideas; If any man can imagine
any thing further, that these had a beginning, and were not eternal, his
judgment can fly to none but an eternal God; So that still there is, by the
ratiocination of man, found out something that is Eternal. When he said [that
by the ascending from the immediate cause to the more remote, a man would lose
himself] it was most ingenious, and had a truth with it (which perhaps will be
farther examined hereafter) if it had been applied to efficient causes; as out
of what Egg this Hen was hatched, and what Hen laid this egg, etc. But when
we resolve things into their constitutive causes, which make their natures that
which they are, then the work will be short as is showed, and the result easy;
man need not lose himself in the inquest. What he says, [ that a man tired in
the search will be ignorant whether he can go further or no] is not so boldly,
as finely affirmed by him; for certainly, although a man be weary in his
journey; yet he can discern whether he can go further or no.

Sect. 7.
He proceeds, and I [ N^que absurdi sequitur quicquam] neither, says he, would
any absurdity follow, Mr. Hobbes's indiff^rence, be the world finite or
infinite.
whether the world be finite or infinite, since, whatsoever the workman should
determine, all those things which we now see, would be seen.] I will not
meddle with what concerns not my present business, but remit the madness of
the worlds infinity in magnitude, as not pertinent to my purpose, and apply my
self to that which is in his following words about Eternity.

Sect. 8.
[ Preterea etsi ex eo quod nihil potest movere seipsum. [Moreover (says he)
although out of this, that nothing can move it self, may be right enough
inferred, that there is some first moving thing, which shall be Eternal; yet
that cannot be inferred thence which men do use to infer, to wit, an eternal
immovable, but, contrariwise, an eternal thing moved; for, as it is true,
that nothing is moved of its self, so it is true likewise, that nothing is
moved but from a thing moved.) He is a most unhappy man in his way of
reasoning, this contradicts what went before; for, His contrad^ction of himself
by inadvertence.
if from that conclusion, which he holds true, nothing can move its self, may
be deduced a first mover which is Eternal, it necessarily follows, that men,
ascending from effects to immediate causes, thence to others, may arrive at
that which is eternal, which was denied not six lines before, and has been
confuted by me. Again, observe that that inference, which he censures, must be
true, and his inference false; For, if there be a first mover, and every thing
moved is moved by another, The first mover proved immovable.
then that which moves must it self be unmoved; for if it move, then that was
not the first mover, but rather that other thing which moved, that he said was
the first moveable; for a first can have nothing before it; but that moveable,
according to his Philosophy, must have another moved thing which moves it; And
for the two Propositions, out of which he draws his inference, he says they
are alike true; I, that they are a like false; that which says, nothing moves
its self; For the nature of every thing, as Aristotle defines it, is the
Principle of motion and rest of each natural body, that is, the natural motion
and rest, and therefore moves every natural body naturally. And therefore the
other Proposition is like false, which says, that every thing which is moved,
is moved by something which is moved it self, which can be affirmed of none but
violent motions, they are forced by something without, but neither natural, nor
animal motions. And this Philosophy he might have known to have been delivered
by many of his friends, the Schoolmen, who disavow Aristotle in that Argument.
I will leave his discourse in the middle, which is a proud contempt of such as
labor to prove the beginning of the World, and close with him again toward
the latter end of 237. Page where he endeavors to answer an Argument somewhat
like that which I urge, but how weakly, let the Reader judge. The Argument it
self is not so strong as mine, and shall together be both examined.

Sect. 9.
He begins thus, [ Quis enim hoc modo demonstrantem laudet.] Who, says he,
will praise a man after this manner demonstrating: if the world be Eternal,
then the number of days (or any other measure of time) infinite has preceded
the birth of Abraham; but the nativity of Abraham preceded the nativity of
Isaac; therefore one infinite, or one eternity, should be greater then another,
which is absurd,] thus far he. Mr Hobb^s's paralogisme.
Consider first the affinity this Argument has with mine in the place to which
this should be inserted; his Argument is drawn from the number of Days, mine
of paternity, which overthrows one of his Answers at the first view, as will
appear in its place. But that which he seems to apply his strength against is
that Axiom, one Infinite cannot be greater then another; This is used
concerning infinite in number; the reason of this is, because whatsoever is
infinite, is boundless, it cannot be out-gone, but its self out-goes every
thing of its kind; now what is greater then another contains that, and exceeds
it; so four exceeds three, and therefore gives it bounds; a hundred, and every
number is bounded, it is not 100. and one, it is bounded in its self; and
therefore every number has its internal bounds, and, if it be exceeded, it
has external bounds, Minimum quod non, as his friends the Schools speak, so
well as maximum quod sic; it has the least term of that it cannot extend to,
as the greatest it can exist in.

Sect. 10.
Well, let us consider his answer [ Similis demonstratio est,] It is a like
Demonstration (says he) as if he from thence, that there is an infinite number
of equal numbers; therefore he should conclude that that there were so many
equal numbers as there are numbers equal and unequal together taken.] I find a
mighty error run through his whole work, which does not become a
Mathematician, and is evident in this Answer, His disputing ex non concessis.
that he disputes Ex non concessis, his Answer is drawn from a supposal, that
there is an infinite number of equal numbers, which is false; there is no
infinite of either equal or unequal numbers; for suppose the world made of
Atoms with Democritus (although they are called Infinite, because man's eye
cannot discern them, No infinity at all of numbers
nor his wit apprehend them) yet they, being bodies that have dimensions, must
have a finite nature; and therefore a certain number of them must go to the
constituting another bigger body, suppose a Million to make a barley corn, what
number you will, yet it is a number, and that number may be reckoned by
unities, every one for a Million, and so every million of Millions may
afterward be reckoned by unities, as one may go for a Million or Millions,
and a million of sheets, or papers, may be filled by these, or more greater
numbers may be united; yet they are, and will be a certain number of them, and
the things of this world are made in number by GOD Almighty, as well as measure
and weight, as the Son of Sirak, Wisdom, 11.20. Well then: there is no infinite
number; he answers from an impossible supposal; but now hence does he infer.
If I should grant there were an infinite number of equal numbers, then that
should be equal to all numbers, even equal and unequal; yes, it must, for
there cannot be an infinite number of unities but must be equal to infinite
twoes, threes, twenties, hundreds; for (...) which is infinite has no bounds,
if it had not infinite twenties, infinite Millions, indeed infinite infinites,
it had some bounds, it is not infinite, whatsoever by any reckonings, even by
myriads, can be bounded, is not infinite, can be exceeded; therefore it is
absurd to say, the world was infinite in duration, for if we conceive it
infinite, Why the world cannot be conceived infinite in duration.
as I argue, there must be as many paternities of Adam, as of Robert, and all
that number of paternities betwixt Adam and Robert are no addition. A drop in
the Sea is an addition, because the Sea is bounded and finite, but if it were
infinite, there could be no addition to it. The greatest number, that is, may
have addition, because it is finite, but what is infinite can have none. Nature
therefore, which abhorres these impossibilities, allows no infinite being in
the world, or to this world; But now consider his answer once again, you shall
find the similitude, he answers, clean contrary to my Argument, and the
Argument opposed by himself. He says, because there is an infinite number of
even numbers, therefore that should be equal. I dispute clean contrary,
because an infinite number of even numbers cannot be equal to even and odd,
which it must if it be infinite; therefore there is no infinite number of even
numbers, twenty must be more then three, and infinite threes, if there were any
such, must be infinite twenties. Likewise, I think I have said enough to this
answer, I will now examine his other.

Sect. 11.
He proceeds in the last line of that page, and the beginning of Page 288. [
Nonne qui Eternitatem mundi sic tollant. Do not (says he) Who so take away
the Eternity of the world, with ^he same work, take eternity from the builder
of this World.] No, say I, by my Argument drawn from the certain number of
paternities, And yet God the Creator, may, and must.
there is no color for that mistake; for I, with St. Luke, 3. and the last,
fix all paternities in God, and make him the father of Adam, beyond which there
is no reckoning. But howsoever my Argument is quit of his Answer, yet he,
although he argue weakly against himself, answers as weakly, for the Argument
no way can be applied to God the maker of the world, not his own Argument. I
will therefore, as near as I can, draw out the force of his Argument; for at
the first blush it appears not. The maker of the world is Eternal, that is,
infinite in duration, and therefore infinite of days may be attributed to him;
therefore he cannot have more days added to him, for if no infinite can be
longer then another, then he, that had an infinite duration in the days of
Abraham, could have no addition in the life of Isaac; so that the denial of an
imparity of infinite numbers, denies likewise, by consequence, the infinite of
God. For satisfaction to this, Conceive that God is Eternal, which is to be
without beginning or end, No before or after in Eternity; and yet how these
terms are applicable to Gods duration or coexistenc^, not to his simple or
absolute existence.
the beginning and end of all Creatures, but he is without either; that in
Eternity there is neither Prius nor Posterius, before or after; for where there
is no alteration, but the thing exists the same for ever, there can be nothing
before or after, for these terms require two things to be applied to, either
this and another, or this differing from its self; but in that Eternity, before
the making of the world, there was nothing besides God, and he without change,
so that there could be no use of those relatives before or after; And this
Philosophy must be true of whatsoever is eternally existing alone. So Plato
concerning his eternal Ideas, before they were incorporated with Chaos; So
Democritus must think of his eternal Atoms, before that good luck, which
brought them together had, compacted them into those bodies which they made.
Now although this, which is eternal, have no before, or after appliable to him
existing in himself; yet when he has made Creatures, then coexisting with
them, and in relation to them, these phrases may be applied, as before this
man, this thing; before a day, a year, or the like; for such relations may
then be had to other things, though none in himself, or to himself; Now,
because of this, no duration of time, no Era, no computation can be applied to
God, before the world, to say he was a day or year, or so, by such time as we
make our Computations, or can tell how to make any; but it is true to say, he
was before the world, which signifies no more but to say, he was, and the world
was not; but to say, he was a Day, a month, or year, or the like, is not
true, nor to be imagined; for time its self (and therefore the parts of it) is
the measure of duration, in regard of its priority or posteriority; so a year
has diverse months, weeks; those, days; and they, hours, distinguished by
the first, second, etc. Now where is not this priority or posteriority, there
can be no imagination of time; so that, for my part, I am of opinion that
these, who hold the whole world to be Eternal, must not, cannot reckon the
duration of the world (because the whole being must be altogether) to say that
it lasts years, days, or so forth, for it must be immutable in its self,
although the parts of it are mutable and subject to change, and they may be
reckoned by these times, or part of them, according to which they exist; and
this world, in the bulk coexisting with its mutable parts, may, in relation to
them, be said to be before or after them; But now the case is otherwise with
God, who was when there was no world, nor any mutable thing, and then could
have none of those relations, which concern them, attributed to him; for when
there is no year, day, hour, how can he be said, to endure and last those
times? nay, although we should fancy such a thing which is not, as a day, or
hour, before this mutable world, yet we cannot apply it to him who has no
succession in him, when he has no successive thing coexisting with him; as
concerning his immensity, he having no quantity, we can say he coexists with
these quantitative things that are in the world; but he being such that neither
the Heaven, nor heaven of heavens can contain, he must exist without them, and
there he cannot be said to exist with any quantity or measure; and to say, Gods
being was a day a year, etc. before the world, when there was no time, were as
improper as to say, he were a yard long, or a mile, where there was no
continued quantity, or body for him to subsist with.

Sect. 12.
Our double conceit of Gods eternity, to which no computation of time is
applicable
By Eternity we conceive either the internal duration of God, or an external
measure of that duration, as time is to the duration of successive things; In
the first, he being subject to no change nor alteration, no composition or
commixtion, we can make no division in it of hours, or days, in his Eternity,
because there is no parts of it subject to any change; For the second, if you
conceive Eternity to be an outward measure, a real measure you cannot, (for
there was no real thing without him) you must make it then only imaginary, in
the apprehension of men, what can that be! First then, there was no man to
imagine it; secondly, if a man's present imagination work upon it, it must make
the measure even to the thing measured, without beginning, without end,
altogether without succession, and then th^nk if there can be day, year,
Olympiad, Eclipse, Era, Epoch, any thing that is used for Computation of
time, found in it; certainly no man's imagination, I think, can apply any such
thing to an eternal being, and therefore not days.

Sect. 13.
This doctrine is most agreeing to the Scriptures (which teaches the truest
Philosophy) for the Scripture makes him to be the Creator of the world; if so,
The doctrine of eternity most agreeable to H. Scripture.
then before the world; then Eternal; then these durations, which are measures
of our worldly things, cannot be affirmed of him, nor time, nor parts of it,
which are only measures proportioned to those things of this world, which are
successive. I need not name the places, but there are many of Scripture which
express this eternal being of God, so Psalm. 90.2. Before the mountains were
brought forth, or ever thou had formed the Earth and the World, even from
everlasting to everlasting thou art GOD; Here, in this one place, is all the
Philosophy I have delivered of Gods eternity; here is contained his Eternal
being, when the world was not, in that is said before. etc. when they were not,
he was. Secondly, here is expressed the total being of the Eternal together,
in that is said, Thou art God from everlasting to everlasting, not thou were,
or wilt be, only, but before them thou art; and here is expressed likewise,
that, in respect of other things, the Creatures, he may be said to have these
relations before and after, though not in relation to himself; but yet no set
term, as to say, a day, or two days, or years, before. I am confident there
is no one place of Scripture which expresses any certain measures of duration
belonging to him. I know it may be objected to this, that in the Epistle to the
Hebrews, Chap. 1. verse. 10, 11, 12. The Apostle, speaking of the Eternity of
our Savior, according to his Divinity, says; Thou Lord in the beginning have
laid the foundation of the Earth, and the Heavens are the works of thy hands.
Verse. 11. They shall perish, but thou remainest, and they all shall wax old as
does a garment. Verse 12. And like a vesture shall thou fold them up, and they
shall be changed; but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail. In
this place the eternity of Christ's divinity is called years; and therefore
those measures of our times must be applied to that Eternity, and then days
may, of which years are composed. To this we may most reasonably answer, that
the Apostle accommodates his manner of language to the capacity of the vulgar,
and the language of men, concerning durations, so well as actions; so before he
said, the Heavens were the works of Gods hands, as if he had said, because all
great works are wrought by hands amongst men, God had hands, by which he
wrought those heavens, So, thy years shall not fail; that is, thou art
Eternal, because men reckon their duration by years; and yet observe the
language, it is said, they are indeficient years, years which fail not, all
our years, fail, the last year is gone, this far in going, and until the
end of the world, man's years, the worlds years, and their durations will
fail; but Gods years, no part of his duration, reckon it what you will, shall
fail. This is the sense of the Scriptures, and men cannot, without a
contradiction, expound it of our time, every part of which is deficient; Thus
the Philosophy I have delivered being framed according to Scripture, I shall
answer his Argument. The days, which may be attributed to God, and the
measures of our time, can only be in regard of his coexisting with time in
this world, and therefore he does not, nor can be said to be of more days,
then the world has; for he, who affirms he has more days, or any such
Computation, affirms a falsehood; there were not more days, therefore not a
coexisting with them; and therefore he had more days when Isaac was born, then
when Abraham; but in neither of them had he an infinite number, but finite
numbers of days; nor does the world yield more; his durance is without number
of weeks, or days, what successive thing soever we account by; and therefore
that Argument, against the worlds eternity, has no force, applied to God.

Sect. 14.
I proceed with him, Ita ab hoc absurdo, etc. [Therefore (says he) from this
absurd thing they fall into another, being constrained to say, that Eternity is
a standing instant and an infinite number of numbers is an Unity, which is much
more absurd.] There are two parts in this Objection, the first concerns the
nunc stans, or permanent instant; the second of innumerable numbers, etc. for
perspicuity I take them apart, and handle them distinctly. And first for his
absurdity that he conceives to be in a standing instant; if it do not stand
still, No absurdity in asserting Eternity to be a standing instant.
and when it does not, it is no longer nunc, or an instant, but time, or at the
least two parts of time, but instant it is not; now, certainly, that which has
no mutation cannot choose but perpetually, eternally, stand still; and that,
which to mutable things would be time, to him must be instant. I can show him
one instant that stood still near two thousand years of time; and therefore,
if time could be infinite, would last eternally, which is John 8.58. When the
Jews wondered that our Savior should have seen Abraham, he answered, before
Abraham was (not I was, but) I am. There is a difference in exposition, some
say that this speech is understood of his Humanity, that his humanity was in
the thoughts of God, and his Decree, before Abraham; but this cannot be the
sense; for Christ being the son and posterity of Abraham, even in the knowledge
and decree of God, as well as in his birth in the world, therefore it could not
be spoke of his humanity, that it was in the Decree of God before Abraham, for
Abraham, in the same Decree, must be before Christ's humanity, as the father of
him: But suppose it were, let me enquire, was that being, which Christ had then
in the knowledge or being of God before Abraham, was that being existing when
he spoke these words, or no? If no, then he could not say I am, but I was; if
so, it proves my Conclusion, that there was a nunc stans, a standing instant
near two thousand years. But I am well satisfied, that that speech, of his,
was meant of his Divinity which is eternally the same, and was before Abraham,
when Abraham was; and after him, he being that which is, which was, and is to
come, Revelation 1.4. And certainly there must needs be the same reason, that
that instant must be Eternal, as that it should stand still so long as before
Abraham to our Savior. But his words, presently after, seem to make another
reason of the absurdity in nunc stans, thus.

Sect. 15.
[ Cur enim Eternitas] Why (says he) should Eternity be called nunc stans, now
standing, rather then tunc, then standing; there must therefore be either many
Eternities, or now and then must signify the same) Thus he for answer; this
term stans or standing, is indifferent to time passed or to come, when applied
to either positively; but if either does imply a Negative of that is present,
in that second consideration it no way agrees to eternity which is always
present; but in the first sense, because eternity comprehends all time, when it
is spoke of any thing done or being in time, as that Isaac was borne, or
Antichrist shall be, this was, or shall be done, may be in Eternity, which
coexists with these times; so, before Abraham was, I am; and who is, was, and
shall be, are spoke of him; and then, when Abraham was, he was, without the
Negative of was, that is, denying it to be now; then when Antichrist will be,
he will be, without any employed Neg. that he is not now; And so comes in the
second part of this Objection, that now and then are all one; For answer;
although now standing and then standing, The difference of nunc stans and tunc
stans as applied to Eternity.
if applied to Eternity, signify the same thing, and we conceive, by both of
them, an eternal immutable being; yet now, and then, alone do signify diverse
things; old Abraham, and young Abraham, signify the same person, but old and
young are diverse. Or thus, Socrates laughing, and Socrates discoursing, are the
same, this is false Logic, and he either considered not what he writ, or did
it with an intention to deceive; this same term [ standing] makes them both be
applied to Eternity, for no duration is standing, or lasting, but that which is
eternal; all others are successive; that eternal thing, which stands now,
without succession, stands then, in passed and future times, whenever they
exist, they changed, but he remaining the same. Expect not a simile to agree in
all things, then it must be that very thing which it assimulates: but thus: As
you may conceive a firm and strong rock made of some Adamantine, or heavenly,
immutable substance; this rock stands still, without change of the least
particle; cut a sluice of the Sea into it, whose waves dash upon it, so long as
these waves batter upon it, that rock is before one, and behind another, none
of which relations it had before; they are in a perpetual flux and change, the
rock stands, as it were, u^concern'd in them; return that Sea into its own
Channel, it has no respect to any wave again, no more then it had before the
coming in of those waters: so that eternal, immutable, unwashable rock of
beings, exists of its self, until these turbulent waves of unconstant time are
let into it, then, all that while, it has these relations to it, of past,
present, and to come; but when things are retreated again, when time cease,
there is no more any of these differences of past, or present, which are
applied to time, and it had in relation only to time and temporary things, but
is purely nunc stans, or tunc stans, I care not which, if it be stans, if it be
standing and permanent, it expresses the notion of eternity. Well, and yet
nunc and tunc, now and then differ in themselves, and are united only in this
which we call Eternity. Revel. 1.8. I am Alpha and Omega, there the time that
was passed, and the time that was to come, every kind of them was applied to
this nunc; the present being, I am, in it comprehended the beginning and the
end of others: it might be said of others, they were the beginning, and should
be the end; but of him, he is the beginning, and the end, the first and the
last, as it is added in the 22. of the same Revelations the 13. He is this in
himself; but then take him coexisting with time, he is he who is, who was, and
who shall be; so that it is evident his duration taken in its self, is the same
time and nunc, now and then; so either of them be considered standing, or
permanent; but, in respect of the Creature, he may be said that was or shall
be. Thus I hope that Argument is answered; nunc and tunc stans, now and then,
so they have that addition of permanent, are the same, which differ without
that addition. Now to the second Argument

Sect. 16.
[ And (says he) they make an infinite number of numbers an unity.] I deny
this Consequence, Eternity coex^sts, with no infinite number of days.
it can be enforced no otherwise then that eternal exists an infinite number of
days, which I deny; Eternity does not exist an infinite number of any measures
of time, nor any time, when time does not exist, as is before expressed: but,
if there should be an infinite time lasting, it would exist with it; but, the
first failing, coexisting with it cannot be.

Thus the Reader may, in a weak manner, conceive this Eternal Now, how it may
be the same with Eternal Then, and how there are not contained an infinite
number of numbers in it.

Sect. 17.
As to those other Arguments drawn from the government of the Creatures, to
prove the main proposition, God so manifest in the Creatures, as all ignorance
is inexcusable.
that there is a God; I could delight to spend whole sheets in discourse upon
them, but that I must not lose my self in this intendment I am about; they are
so evident, that, as St. Paul, where before cited, Romans 1.20. it renders men
without excuse; For the Heavens declare the glory of God, and the Firmament
shows his handy work, Psalm. 19.1. There is no speech nor language where their
voice is not heard, Verse. 3. So that the manifestation is universal, no man can
be excused from the observation of these things, verse 4. Their line, or
direction, is gone throughout all the earth, and their words to the end of the
world: I must not be long in this Theme; As when a man sees a brave house
gloriously built, he cannot choose but think him an excellent workman that
wrought it: so does the beauty of this great building of the World make us
admire the workman; As he, who should hear excellent Music, must needs think
it the work of some eminent Musician; As a man, when he sees a Great man's
house governed with regularity, and ordered in an exact discipline, must needs
think there is a discreet Steward or Master, who disposes and orders that
family: so when the Method, in which the world is contrived, and disciplined,
is considered, a man must needs think that there is an infinite wisdom which
governs all: And therefore the son of Sirach, Wisd. 13.5. By the greatness
and beauty of Creatures, proportionably, the Maker of them is seen; that is,
the maker of this house, the Artist, who composed the Harmony, the Contriver of
this discipline is discerned by the effects of it, which, because they require
a vast and immense power and wisdom, we must attribute to God; for if a man
would think with himself how innumerable accidents, that is, external things,
conduce to the producing of the least effect, a man cannot conceive how less
then an Infinite wisdom and power could, in such a Method, concenter them to
the least business. But I lose my self with delight in this admiration of my
God, and I desist. These, and the like reasons do cherish that innate Axiom,
That there is a God, even in natural Man; And this leaves all the world without
excuse, for not knowing, there is a God, or knowing there is one, but not
worshipping him as God, or, knowing him thus, as Nature teaches him, for
worshipping Idols, or Images, which they must needs know not to be the Author of
these great effects.

A PARAENETICAL digression to Mr. HOBBES.
NOw Mr. Hobbes, if this Treatise come to your hand, as, it is likely, it may,
give me leave to advise you a little with words that may lie by you, and so not
pass slightly away. You are a man, as I observe, in this Philosophy-treatise,
of more then ordinary conceit; you have spent much time in the search of
Nature, although you are full of Paradoxes, and those not strengthened with any
greater reason then your own Authority; yet they taste of a mighty Acumen
ingenii, as likewise of a most industrious and working head, to contrive and
bring those apparent Errors to such ends as you have brought them; but, good
Sir, consider why do you so constantly in your Leviathan, and upon all
occasions, so unnecessarily, take advantages to speak against the known, and
most received Truths in Divinity? What need had you in this place to dispute
the case of the Eternity of the World, and to say, that the question of the
origin of the world should be left to those which are lawfully over us in
ordering Divine worship, Page 237. Sir, we know who you mean by that from your
Leviathan, to wit, the Supreme Magistrate; suppose he should be an Atheist, and
deny the Creation; would you do so likewise? you seem to be ready, and invite
others to it, in scorning those reasons are brought for it, and laboring to
weary the faith of a Christian man in it; It is true, Faith is able to support
a fainting Soul against the distractions which wicked Reason can object; but it
is a wicked Reason that troubles and distracts it. John 20.20. It is said of
the Disciples, that they were glad when they saw the Lord after his
Resurrection; not that they doubted of it before, they were not all Didymusses;
but Faith her self is comforted by Reason and visible experiments, as it is
tired and wearied in struggling against Reason. Consider with your self what you
will answer Almighty God at the last day, when he shall say, I have assisted
thee in the purchase of so much Learning, how have thou used it to my honor?
why did thou abuse it to my dishonor, in disputing against, and disturbing
my poor servants from their assents to those Divine truths I prescribed in my
word? It will not serve your turn to say, You did it by Fate; for the same Fate
will fatalize you to a worse condition then that brought you to this, if you do
not repent; it is not in this one point, but twenty more, you are guilty of
this fault, studying to countenance Atheistical Wits with shows of Reason to
abet their wickednesses. For God's sake (if you think there is one) and his Son
Jesus Christ's sake, without whom you cannot be saved (if you think there is a
Jesus Christ, and that there will be a Salvation) with your own hand blot out
these hand-writings of your own, which will lie against you, and condemn you;
it were better done by you, with pardon from God for them, then by others
reasons confuted to nothing, and the guilt remain with you. I am persuaded you
can object little against this I have writ; and although, after these Arguments
I have discussed, Page 238. You say concerning the Worlds magnitude and
beginning, you are content with that doctrine which the Scriptures persuade,
and the fame of those Miracles which confirm them, the Country-custome, and
the due reverence of the Laws; this you say, you are content with, but, like a
discontented man, you wrangle against all; can any thing be more clearly
delivered in Scripture then the Creation of the world? has not the constant
custom of your Nation, ever since Christianity was planted, acknowledged it?
yea, I could tell you the custom of this Nation before Christianity was
settled, even the Druids acknowledged it; is it not an act anciently confirmed
by our Laws, and yet unrepealed? you then did but speak this, and not do it,
but snarle, under a color of reason, against that which you profess and
certainly ought to repent for doing; and though you say, this reasoning
contemned by learned men; yet I can show you somewhat like this even in one
which you your self commend in your Epistle, and I am persuaded, you cannot
satisfactorily answer this I have said (laying aside the Scripture) but with
scorns, as you use to do, or with other as weak blasphemies, I pray God
forgive you, and work a repentance in you.

And now, Reader, do thou forgive the tediousness of this digression; in
general, let me advise this, that if thou meetest with any of these
muddy-souled Writers, which, with Thomas, will believe nothing but what they
see, do then consider our Saviors answer, Jo. 20.29. Blessed are they that do
not see, and yet believe. Does God reveal in his Sacred and blessed Word any
thing that seems incongruous to thy Reason? know it is most agreeing, although
thou discoverest it not; and believe what he requires, against thine own
reason, so shall thou be blessed by God, and thy Faith shall be crowned with
happiness, which is my prayer, and shall be my endeavor in this, and all I
write.

CHAP. XV.
Concerning the opinion of a Deity; Formed Religion, what, and wherein founded.

Sect. 1.
THus, having past a few Observations upon his Seeds of Religion, I skip many
impertinent discourses of his in the way, and come to his Notes upon the
dissolution of Religion, which are entered upon by him, Page 58. thus [ From the
propagation of Religion it is not hard to understand the Causes of the
resolution of the same into its first Seeds or Principles: which are only an
opinion of a Diety, and Powers invisible, and supernatural. Mr. Hobbes
contradict's himself, as touching the seeds of Religion.
] Let the Reader at first consider the inconstancy of this Writer, how
immediately he not only deserts what he had writ in this very Chapter, but
opposes it. He just before made those four fancies to be the Seeds of
Religion, now he makes it only One, and that not the same with any of the
other; nay, he opposes himself in this very Sentence, for he speaks of the
resolution of it into its first Seeds and Principles, in the Plural number,
and yet says, which are only an opinion of a Diety. Thus inconstant is Error,
Which are more then only an opinion of a Deity, etc.
but then that is an intolerable Phrase for him to use, to term the Seeds of
Religion, an Opinion of a Diety; for although this word Opinion may have a
large Sense, and be taken for whatsoever knowledge any man has of any thing,
whether by Faith or Demonstration; yet, since he has formerly defined it in a
weak manner to be be a poor and faint assurance, Page 31. it was unworthily,
and disgracefully done of him, to call this inbred principle, this which
abides so much demonstration a Posteriori to the learned, so much persuasive
illustration to the meanest capacity, to call this barely Opinion; but he
labors throughout the Book covertly to insinuate, as much as he can, a
disgraceful conceit of Religion, which I mean to Observe in my travailes
through it.

Sect. 2.
He proceeds, and affirms that [ that can never be abolished out of humane
nature, but that new Religions may again be made to spring out of them by the
culture of such men as for such purpose are in reputation.] This Proposition is
delivered in such universal terms as makes it exceeding difficult to
understand what he means by it, Mr. Hobbes more perplexed in his writing then
the Schoolmen.
He talks of, and censures the Schoolmen for a mystical way of writing, but,
certainly, their language is Significant, Logical, Gramatical, which his is
not; for first, what does he mean by humane nature, the Species or kind of
man, as we call it Mankind? I am confident then it is true; but if he mean
that particular nature of Socrates or Plato, How far the foresaid opinion may
be abolished out of humane nature.
although it cannot be so extirpated out of it, as that it cannot be introduced
again; yet it is many times so abol^shed, as it is not introduced by those he
names. But then mark what follows [ but that new Religions may be made to
spring out of them.] Consider at the beginning he spoke of Seeds in the Plural
number, then he made those many Seeds but one, now again in this Term ( Them)
he makes many again; For the Term ( Them) can relate to nothing but the
former Seeds or Seed specified. He writes most perplexedly, and because not
clear expressions to the understanding, therefore not perspicuous to have
Observations made upon any thing in his writing but the confusedness, yet I
will proceed with him.

Sest. 3.
[ For (says he) seeing all formed Religion is founded at first upon the Faith
which a multitude has in some one person whom they believe, not only to be a
wise man, and to labor to procure their happiness, but also to be a holy man,
to whom God himself vouchsafes to declare his will supernaturally.] Consider
how this Gentleman's language contradicts himself: first he made the Seed of
Religion only an Opinion of a Diety, that was for taking Opinion in a large
Sense; now he makes it to be the belief men have of some man: But yet I can
answer for him somewhat: that in the first place he spoke of Religion, now he
speaks of it as a formed Religion, by which, I think, and only think (for that
Phrase, formed Religion, What may be supposed Mr. Hobbes mean's by a Formed
Religion.
is an unusual Phrase) yet I think he means some set form of worship, by which,
in such or such a manner, men express their duties to God; now as Averroes
said, to sacrifice to God was dictated by nature, but whether to Venus, or
Diana, was the direction of man; so, it may be, he means, by this word Formed,
some particular restraint of Religion to this or that particular way; and the
Seed of this is the Belief, etc. I have made out the sense as well as I can, to
make it hold together: Well then, I will take Formed Religion for such which,
in a several sort of men, is allotted to Divine worship. Seeing then (says he)
all formed Religion is founded, etc. How he imposes upon his Reader.
This Phrase seeing then should relate to some former proof or illustration of
this Proposition, but I can find no such thing attempted, nor this Proposition
any where else delivered by him: This is a strange kind of juggling, to make the
Reader believe, that he has proved that which he never spoke of before. Well:
we will examine the Conclusion, [ All formed Religion is founded at first upon
the faith,] we will first examine this Term ( founded, Formed Religion not
founded upon his phantastike Faith.
at first) that may be understood, that Religion is bottomed upon this belief,
as a building, which is raised upon a rock, is said to be founded upon it which
is the last and lowest support of it. Now this belief, which he speaks of,
cannot be such, for the foundation of Religion, as he spoke before, is the
assurance of a God, which is either had by nature, or by those demonstrations,
and illustrations spoke of before; but perhaps, he will say, this is the
foundation of Religion, in general, as Religion, but not as a formed Religion,
as this particular, that is only that Belief which he speaks of; I will
therefore examine it in those two most remarkable Religions, The Jewish and
Christian principally to be examined.
and evidently to be discerned, the Jews Religion, and Christian, in both
which we may observe two principal things in the forming them; for Religion,
and a most reverential worship due to God is apparent out of nature, and the
demonstrations before spoke of; but then the forming it consists in these two
things, who this GOD is, whether Jehovah or Baal, Christ or Jupiter; and then
what manner of worship is to be performed to these; and both these formings, I
affirm, are formed, bottomed, supported by something much more firm then that
belief he speaks of. First then for the form of the Jewish Religion, in the
first motion, whether Jehovah or Baal, any heathen god be the God to whom
Religion is to be paid, this was not founded upon the faith which the multitude
had in some one Person, as he fancieth.

CHAP. XVI.
What Religion before the Flood. What meant by that Invocation, Genesis 4.26. The
sins and punishment of them that perished in the Flood. The prevalence of
Religion, whence.

Sect. 1.
THe Conditions of Religion before the Flood, No prob^li^y of Idolatry before
the flood.
has so little spoke of it in Scripture, as it has bred dispute amongst
Divines whether there were any Idolatry, either Worship of Idols or false Gods
in that long tract of time; that which persuades me to think there was none,
is, that although the time was long, yet the Ages of men were so vast, that
there must needs be a Memorial of the Creation, for there was little more then
half a man's life, not above five or six hundred years betwixt Adam and Noah,
which must needs be continued in that long-living age by such as were
Contemporaries with them both; and then, besides this, there is no mention of
any false God worshipped, or any Idolatry in that whole Story. Wherefore in the
silence of Scripture, which records other faults of that Age, but not this, we
may collect from the former reason justly, that there was no probability of any
such forgetting of God, whose great work of making them was so fresh amongst
them.

Sect. 2.
Some Arguments are objected against this Conclusion; 1. Argument.
that in the last verse of the 4th. Chapter of Genesis it is said, that Adams
son Seth begot Enos and then men began to call upon the Lord; so that,
because men are never without some Religion, and it seems the Religion to the
true God was forgot so quickly, it seems necessary that then they should have
some Religion to a false God.

Answ.
For the understanding of this place, conceive with me, that it cannot be
understood in that down right sense which the words seem at first to bear, and
they who object it, would infer: For Invocation or calling upon the name of
the Lord, Invocation taken for the whole worship of God.
as it is many times (it being a principal piece of it) is taken for the whole
worship of God, it cannot be that men should now begin to do that which,
without doubt, Adam, Abel, Seth, and all such as were godly must needs have
done long before; Practiced by Adam Abel, Seth, etc.
Nay, although this Story of the Fathers is delivered by Moses in exceeding
short notes, yet in the 3. and 4. verse. of this 4. Chap. it is recorded, that
both Cain and Abel brought Oblations to the Lord, which was an Act of Religion;
so that Religion did not now begin. There are many witty Expositions given, Or
for some peculiar additional Devotion.
and some in their Expositions destroy the Text; but what seems most probable
to me is, that, as in every age men, desirous of Gods honor, studied which way
to act it most laudably, and give any addition to it; so now they might, at
this time, add something to their natural worship by prostration on the
ground, and Oblaeions and sacrifices, as Hymmes and Invocations of God, which
were not used before: Men began to call upon the name of the Lord in such a
way, which afterward improving it self to a general Devotion amongst the
sons of God (as I think pious men were called in those days) it gained that
name in a peculiar manner to be attributed to it, so that men began that
worship which was known by the name of calling upon God: As you may see in
Confession, A like instance in Confession
every acknowledgement of a man's sins, or God's goodness, is Confession; yet
if you ask, have you been at Confession? It is understood of Confessing to a
Priest, and accounting your sins to him. Instances might be very many in this
kind; take one more, perhaps a little closer; The Church Service.
We know that every pious act is a service to God, yet, for the eminence and
excellence of it, The Common Prayer, used in the Church, has so appropriated
that name, that if a man asked were you at Service to day? it will be
understood of Common Prayer. If the Question be, at what time did service
begin? The answer will be, Nine, Ten, Two, Three a clock, and be applied only
to the beginning of serving God with it: yea, I have heard many answer, I was
at Sermon, not at Service; so distinctly is the word applied to that of Common
Prayer. I can add one Instance more, almost in the very words before
specified; Gloria Patri.
that Doxologie which is used in the Church at the end of every Psalm, and some
other times in the Common Prayers, used in divine Service (Glory be to the
Father, etc.) did so gain the approbation of that name Gloria Patri, that
although all religious devotions paid to God, are honoring and glorifying of
him; yet when we hear men speak of Gloria Patri, we know they mean this
Doxologie, and we can say of it, that Gloria Patri began with Flavianus, as
Theodoret (assisted by St. Chrysostom) and Nicephorus; so that although, in the
end of this Doxologie, it is said, As it was in the beginning, is now, etc.
that is, that in all ages men did give Glory to the Father, etc. Yet we can
say, that at that time began Glory to the Father, etc. So was it in this
occasion, then began the Name of God to be glorified with some particular
service, although men did in all ages before glorify him. So that we may well
believe that in that time of the birth of Enos, or some years after, began that
piece of worship, That peculiar devotion introduced in Enos's time.
which, for some eminency, had that name of calling upon God, by the use of
speech, appropriated to it. Whether this addition was by the Institution of God
immediately; or Divine men, as Seth or Enos, introduced it in the Public
Religion, I determine not, being not revealed, but conceive this the most
reasonable way of expounding that place, which cannot be understood in that
gross way it is urged.

Sect. 3
2. Argument.
A second Argument to prove, that there was an Idolatrous worship before the
Flood is thus framed. The punishment of Sins is proportioned to the Sins
which are punished; now the Flood being the greatest punishment that ever God
afflicted the world with, it is necessary that it should be for the worship of
false Gods, or Idolatry, which are the greatest Sins.

Answ. The punishm^nt disproportionate to sin in this world.
To this is rightly answered, that the punishment of Sins in this world is not
always proportioned to the sins; All the temporal punishment, that men have,
is less then they deserve, and therefore may in justice be moderated according
to Gods equitable kindness; what punishment God laid upon these men, who
perished in the Flood, after death, was not revealed, but the judgment was
most right, because they held the truth of God in unrighteousness, as St. Paul,
Romans 1.18. and, as it is in the 21. verse of the same, Because they, knowing
GOD, glorified him not as God, neither were thankful, but became vain in their
imaginations. So that the Condemnation upon the Gentiles was not always for
Errors in judgment, but Errors in practice, that although they did know God
aright, yet they did not worship him as God. And therefore we may be satisfied,
concerning their sins, with what the Scripture reveals, Of what sort were
their sins who perished in the Flood.
and need not make them worse then they were described there, which says, That
the wickedness of man was great in the Earth, and that every Imagination of
the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually, Genesis 6.5. and it is the
same which S. Paul before, they became vain in their Imaginations, that is,
their desires, and affections (as was described before) they were given to all
Luxury and sensuality. So that here was a large scope for Gods justice to
punish, and the temporal punishment of this world, Death by drowning, was
vehemently called for by the sins of those men, who lived in that Age, without
any addition of false worship. I therefore conclude for that first age, in the
first sense, in respect of the God they worshipped, there was none but the
right God worshipped in the world; but in regard of the second sense, the manner
of worship in their Religion to him, unless these Oblations before spoke of,
we find nothing recorded before the Flood, that is necessary to be assented to.

Sect. 4.
For both these we cannot conceive, that this Religion, so formed, was founded
upon the Faith, etc. Revelation, not reason, did dictate the first Religion.
For although we may justly think that men, who have either by an Innate
principle, or else by reason, knowledge that there is a GOD of an infinite
excellency, to whom, out of duty, they owe this divine Worship which is called
Religion; we may likewise think, that it is impossible for their capacities to
find out what worship would be pleasing to him, unless he reveal it; and
therefore did act all they did, in that worship, by his direction; yet, because
there is no mention of such direction given by God before the Flood, some men
may conceive that Seth, or such pious men, might Inventis addere, and make some
additions, now and then, according to the Principles of pious reason, to those
received Duties which were acted before, and then that form, or at the least,
that piece of the form of Religion was founded upon the Faith, etc. I will
therefore explain one distinction which may serve our turn, perhaps often,
hereafter in our Controversy, and I think will make this appear easy.

Sect. 5.
That is, there is a difference betwixt an occasion of a Religion, The
difference betwixt the occasion and foundation of a Religion.
and the foundation of it, the occasion may be this Faith he speaks of, but the
foundation is the Revelation of the will of God, that he will be so worshipped,
as thus; Suppose Seth, or Noah, a man in whom they have such a Faith, that is,
an opinion of his wisdom or kindness to them, his esteem with God; suppose
such a man should direct such or such a Duty; they listen to it for the
estimation they have of his ability; Which prevai^eth according to the
congruity it has to the will of God.
afterward, upon experience, or examination, they find it congruent to the will
of God; then they practice it accordingly with confidence: But if it be
received barely upon the credulity of such a person, and found incongruous to
the will of God, afterward it will be rejected; which shows that, not the
faith, in the man, is the foundation of this form of Religion, but the
Congruence it has with the will of God. And this is the foundation of all
Religion, the Revelation of Gods will to be pleased with such service. As it
happens in a foundation, that Rock, upon which a Castle is built, is the
foundation, and the sole foundation, there may perhaps be other things
necessary, to dig the earth before we come to the Rock, or else to remove the
rubbidge, which may hinder the settling the house upon it, but only the Rock is
the foundation; so it may be, that such a man, of whom he speaks, may be
useful to the building of Religion, to the manifestation of this Rock, to the
removing many impediments, which would hinder men from settling themselves and
their Faith, upon it; but only that is the Rock. There is one clause in this
Conclusion which may amuse the Reader, that is, that the person, on whom they
believe, they believe to be such [ to whom God himself vouchsafes to declare
his will supernaturally.] Now it is true, this for the most part is necessary
to the plantation of Religion, Whatsoever men's opinion be of the Person that
introduces it.
as I said, to remove the Obstacles, that this direction, which I receive, is
not the word of God, or not pleasing to him, and the like; but the foundation
is, that God reveals this to be his will. Suppose Seth preached the duties of
Religion, we have this faith, or opinion of Seth (for divine Faith it is not,
unless God declare Seth is such) we may have some weak belief that this is
the will of God, because honest Seth, to whom God, as we apprehend, makes many
revelations, delivers it for such to us; but we believe the duty because God
requires it, and upon that we build our Religion, the other is removing the
rubbige. Or thus, an Act of Parliament is made, we submit to the Authority, are
confident of our security accordingly; yet I, who was not at the making of that
Act, know only that that, which I read in the Book, was an Act of Parliament,
by the Printer that printed it, and that such an Act is tolerated by the
Magistrate to pass for an Act. Now the foundation of the safety of my practice
is the Act of Parliament, not the Printer, these are assistants to let me know
this is an Act of Parliament, not the foundation; so it is with this case in
hand, honest Seth is like the Printer, he delivers it so to me for the will of
God, I ought, in discretion, to believe it such; but I build my practice, and
found it upon this reason, because it is the will of God. Many may be the
Arguments which induce a persuasion that this is the will of God, but because
this is the will of God, is the sole foundation of my Religion.

Sect. 6.
But it may be O^j^cted, that both he, and I, have said before, that the
foundation of Religion was the assurance that there is a God, How this
difference is consistent with the other of assurance that there is a God
now I make it the revealed will of God, which are not the same: I answer, that
it is true, the foundation of Religion, as Religion, is, that there is a God;
for therefore we know that we must give him Divine worship, because we know he
is such; but the foundation of formed Religion, that we must worship him this
or that way, is, because he has revealed that he likes this or that manner of
service. And thus, I think, that Proposition is cleared, that not the Faith in
the man, but in the revealed will of God, is the foundation of all formed
Religion. At the first I projected a long discourse concerning the forming the
Jewish Religion and the Christian from that, Why the promised discourse of the
Jewish and Christian Religion is omitted.
before I was aware, I stepped into the forming of Religion before the Flood,
which might have been spared, but being writ I let pass as it is, and omit
what should follow about my design at the first, concerning those two most
eminent formed Religions, for by this which has been delivered, and by the
continued stories both of the Old and New Testament, it appears, that by
Miracles and other Revelations GOD manifested his will to these people in those
Ages wheresoever Religion was planted. And indeed this was the sole occasion of
publishing the Scriptures; I will not insist therefore at this time upon this
Conclusion.

CHAP. XVII.
Of suspected Governors, and th^^r forming or adding to Religion. Its
independence. ^^^iefe of seeming contradictions, etc.

Sect. 1.
HE proceeds [ It follows necessarily, when they that have the government of
Religion shall come to have either the wisdom of those men, their sincerity,
Mr. Hobbes abstruse in making out his conclusion of suspected Governors and
their Religion.
or their love suspected.] Let us pause a little upon this Phrase ( those men)
it is a most ambiguous Relative, if it relate to the man on whom they believed,
as before, as it seems to do, thus it must be, that the Governors of the
Church suspect those men whose credit was an Argument to form the Religion; but
that cannot be, for the suspicion of the Governor, and his lack of assurance,
does not necessarily introduce a doubt in the Religion; because few Governors
dare discover their own doubts, and their suspicion is seldom an infectious
evil, or, if so, yet not Epedemicall, unless countenanced and assisted by the
Sword; but although the words do import a suspicion in those Governors, yet
h^s meaning is, that the Governors own wisdom, integrity, etc. are suspected,
as it is evident by the following words [ Or that they shall be unable to show
any probable token of divine Revelation] this cannot be spoken of the first
instruments in the forming Religion, because God confirmed their Doctrine with
Miracles every where; it must therefore be understood of the Governors to whom
this Religion is committed, but how harshly, in Common language, that Relative
( those men) will be applied to these Governors, may easily appear to any man
who reads it; well: his Conclusion is, that they, the Governors being
suspected, the Religion, which they desire to uphold, must be suspected
likewise, and (without the fear of the Civil Sword) contradicted, and rejec^^d.

Sect. 2.
I conceive if his premises had been true, the Conclusion would not be deduced
out of them; Christian Religion depends not upon the integrity and sufficiency
of Church Governors.
for Religion formed is like the statute Lsw, as before is expressed, the
Governors may be thought as Judges, whose ability or integrity may be
suspected in expounding the sense of it, yet the Law is still as true, and
remains as unsuspected as if they were virtuous; the folly and corrupt manage
of the Judges may let in a loosnesse of living, and a neglect of the Law; but
it lessens not the Obligation of it, nor the estimation, but amongst slight
and trivial persons. So if Bishops, or the Governors in Religion, cease to
have Apostolical integrity or sufficiencies, or that degree of it which should
be expected from such persons, they open a gap to the Countenancing of
wickedness and profaneness; but the Religion of Christians, which is built and
founded upon the revealed will of God in the Statute Book the Bible, is not
tainted by it, nor the duty to it in the Opinion of any but men of Fancy; for
they neither being the foundation, nor the evidence of the foundation, only
preservers of it, out of Office, not of nature, they may do much harm to the
building, but not corrupt the foundation, nor destroy the evidence of it, which
was set out by those who were instruments in the first forming that Religion,
not them which were Governors afterward.

Sect. 3.
He goes on, indeed in some Method and ingenuity, to show how Governors may
fall under this suspicion; and first he says, [ That which takes away the
reputation of wisdom in him, who forms or adds to Religion, when it is
already formed, is the enjoining a belief of contradictories] I here stop, and
tell you, there is a difference betwixt the formers of a Religion, and the
Governors, as I have showed; and for this word Contradiction, I say, that in
the forming of Religion, Religion formed by divine revelations may o^l^ge to a
belee^e of seeming contradictions.
which is to be done by the revealed will of God immediately, the wit of man is
not to dispute contradictions; but whatsoever it shall please God to reveal,
we are to believe, though it appear to us Contradictory; I dare say, I can
demonstrate some things, which a weak and silly man would think contradictions,
and a man exceeding me in learning, as much as I do him, may serve me so, and
much rather that infinite perfection, and not to be fathomed abyss of Gods
most unsearchable wisdom, may say a thousand things apparent to it, feasible by
that infinite power, which the wisest man may be at a loss to find possible;
and therefore whatsoever is delivered by the first agents in forming a
Religion, by the immediate revelation of God, must be believed, although it
appear to us full of contradictions; but what he speaks to us concerning the
Governors, if they should add any thing to the former credenda, things to be
believed, which to humane judgment appears contradictory, their wisdom will
be disparaged by it, may be allowed. But at the latter end of that sentence he
says,

Sect. 4.
[ A man may have a revelation of many things above, but of nothing against
natural reason.] This seems to be flat against the excellency of that Faith,
The singular excellency of Faith to be as well against as above Reason.
for which the Father and pattern of the faithful is commended by St. Paul,
Romans 4.18. who, speaking of Abraham, says, Who against (not only above) hope,
believed in hope; where in express terms the Apostle overthrows his
distinction; for against hope (must be against that hope, which natural Reason
could give him) he believed in the promise which God made; in Faith as it was
with him, so it must be with us. It is said in the following verse, that he
considered not his own body now dead, nor the deadness of Sarahs womb; so must
we not consider our impossibility in things delivered by God, how they oppose
our reason, but believe, without thought of nature or reason for it, yea though
it be against our reason; and therefore it is most appositly phrased by St.
Paul in the first and last Chapters to the Romans, Obedience unto faith; men
must captivate their Reason to the revelations of God, and, not considering
what Reason says against it, submit to it. Thus I think, in those cases where
the instruments of forming a Religion do propose any thing though contrary to
our reason, or contradictory in our apprehension, we ought to submit to it,
although not, in those cases, to these who have the government in Religion,
when it is once formed.

Sect. 5.
I will add one note more, pertinent to this business, that although in the
following 59. page he puts down examples which illustrate his other grounds of
suspicion, yet, as a man guilty, he sets down none for this, Mr. Hobbes's
subtlety in his citation and praetermission of examples.
but having (as I have reason to mistrust) some ill design, puts it down in a
language, and manner fit enough to steal a belief of what he speaks into an
inconsiderate Reader, although he gives no proof of what he writes to a
judicious Reader. And now I have finished what I intended concerning this
Chapter, for the other things which, he says, bring these persons into
suspicion, by reason of the deficience of those qualities, I grant to him, and
cannot choose but say, Which, though pertinent, are dangerous to weak
capacities.
they were handsome and ingenious expressions, and likewise fitted with very
pertinent examples; but they accidentally only, when unluckily they happen to
be observed by weak capacities, do distract the vivacity and quickness of
their Faith, and so, perhaps, may in tract of time quench and extinguish the
flame of it to its first Principles, as I have showed. And here I will settle
my self to what follows in the next Chapter.

CHAP. XVIII.
Concerning the equality or inequality of men by nature; Their prudence, and
self-opinion of it, not universal.

Sect. 1.
THis Chapter is entitled Of the natural Condition of Mankind, as concerning
their felicity or misery: Mr. Hobbes's scandalous description of man.
and is the prettiest great nothing that ever I read; it makes a brave and
gallant show of ingenious Paradoxes, but is only a show, where truths and
falsehoods are so ingeniously mixed as the one sets off the other with a great
semblance of reality, although it be but a semblance; He describes a man by his
worst pieces only, many of which are truly in him; but delivering them only,
without his good, he makes him little better then an incarnate Devil, yea,
what is worser, makes him seem to act those things justly which we abominate
in them; so that he should be the hatefullest creature in the world; I will
therefore, for the honor of Mankind, endeavor to rescue it from such foul
scandals and aspersions, not catching at every word, but driving at the maine
sense of what he delivers.

Sect. 2.
The equality of men by nature not universal.
He lays the foundation of this Chapter upon equality of men, which are (says
he) made so equal by nature, that there is an inconsiderable difference. I put
not down his own words, but the sense, to avoid tediousness. This Conclusion,
for the most part, is true, but, in general false; for, if we look to the
bodies of some men, we see them so decrepid, that their strength is not
considerable alone; and what he talks of confederacy, by that account he may
bring a Fly in competition, for a Fly, with company enough, can effect any
thing; and for the Soul, there are some men so sottish, and incapable of
design, or contrivance, that, certainly, there are many Beasts which exceed
them in fitness for such business as he allot's them; but, allow this phrase,
as he utter's it, to be understood of the greater sort and number of men, not
of all.

Sect. 3.
Then let us consider that Phrase, ( Nature has made men) what shall we
understand by Nature, The estate in which Adam and Ev^h were made.
Natura naturans, the God of Nature, who, at the first, made men? then we must
affirm this of Adam and Evah, which were made, without question, in no state
of enmity, nor in an absolute equality, but such a difference as was necessary
for two friends which might assist one another, wishing each other good, and
the good of each other was the good of both; the hopes of each, the hopes of
both; so that those could not be the works of Nature which he means, being
such as were made for peace and amity, and where was impossibility of hostility
betwixt them, the hurt of either being the hurt of both, because which soever
was destroyed, the other lost much of assistance. We will therefore see how
other sons of Nature are made; in what condition whatsoever Man else was made,
by nature he was made a poor helpless Child, That wherein others.
in the greatest disproportion, both of Soul and body, to his Parents, that
possibly can be; and, in this state, there are none of those things which he
fancieth, nor hopes of attaining ends, nor fears of others assistance; but the
poor Infant confides and trusts in h^s Parents, and submits to them. Methinks,
he discourses of Men as if they were Terrigenae, born out of the earth, come up
like Seeds, without any relation one to the other. I let alone his secret vaunt
of Knowledge, in the latter end of this 60. Page

Sect. 4.
But in the bottom of that page, Memory, Experience, and Prudence
distinguished.
he says [ Prudence is but Experience, which equal time bestows equally upon
all men, in those things they equally apply themselves to.] See here the
unconstancy of this Author; Chap. the 2. Of which I have discoursed, he says,
Experience is memory of many things, Chap. 8. page 34. (he says) Prudence
depends upon Experience; now it is but Experience: These two are impossible to
be true both; for nothing does depend upon it self; that, which it depend's
upon, must be distinct from what depend's upon it; now we may distinguish th^se
three thus; Memory retains the actions done and past; Experience collects from
thence the practices of men in such cases; but Prudence, according to both
Memory, Experience, and the rules of right reason, drawn from all the guidance
of History, or Natural reason, or what else can supply any assistance to the
intended end, directs a man in his actions; and therefore he spoke very weakly
of Prudence, when he said, it was but Experience; and contrarily, there is a
mighty difference in men's Prudence; for Prudence is a thing acquired by
industry and pains, in which, as men differ in the industry, so they do in
Prudence, yea all men have not the like advantages of conversing with able men
and Books, which are great helps for the getting Prudence; though they may
have the same industry.

Sect. 5.
Page 61. He says, that [ that which may make such equality (that is, of
Prudence, concerning which he had spoken before) incredible, is but a vain
conceit of our own wisdom, etc. for such is the nature of men, that howsoever
they may acknowledge many others to be more witty, or more El^quent, or more
Learned, yet they will hardly believe there are many so wise as themselves; for
they see their own wit at hand, Mr Hobbes confuse, ^f not contradict^^y to
himself, in arguing.
and others at a distance.] This is a strange contradictory passage to its
self; for first consider that what was conceited by this to be opposed, was the
equality of Prudence; to oppose this he introduces men's conceits of their own
wisdom; he that reflects upon his Exposition of names in Cap. 5. page 22.
shall find Prudence and Wisdom two things; Therefore a high esteem of a man's
own wisdom may be without the like imagination of his own Prudence. Then
consider, that he says, Men will allow others more witty, learned, eloquent,
but not more wise; he proves this, because men see their own wit at hand, mark
how he said, just before, that they would allow others more wit, but not more
wisdom the reason, says he, because they see their wit at hand; would not
this, if it prove any thing, prove the contrary to what he uses it? That,
because their wit, not their wisdom, is discerned at hand, others at a
distance, therefore their wit must appear great, though not their wisdom. This
manner of false reasoning, unreasonable arguing, is frequent with him
throughout the whole Book.

Sect. 6.
But to the Conclusion; Men, universally, no such opiniatours of their own
prudence as Mr. Hobbes pretends.
this estimation of a man's own eminence in Prudence is least discerned of any
thing in that universality which he expresses; for first, if Prudence, as he
just before defined it, be but Experience, it is impossible that young men
should think they have as much Experience as old; then if Prudence be (as it
is) the guide of a man's actions to their designed ends, then consider that
there are none but Fools who do not take advise of men more excellent in their
several ways then themselves. Do not men, that would get health, advise with
Physicians? for the settling their estates, advise with Lawyers? for the
managing of a business at Court, or Country, advise with others more prudent
in these practices? In this particular business, although, I am confident, I
speak more rationally then he, or perhaps then some others would do with whom
I consult; yet I advise with those less scient, but I think more prudent then
my self (whether it be discretion to publish this or not) what is the reason of
this? but that I, and all others, do acknowledge our selves to be less
prudent, though we find our selves more learned then some others; well then:
that doubt, he raises, was but a fancy of his own, and had no foundation upon
any ground of reason, or experience, and therefore what he builds upon it must
needs fall of its self; where I leave it, and step to the consideration of
other inferences which he introduces, the first of which is thus framed.

CHAP. XIX.
Of enmity pretended from equality of our desires. How Reason and Religion
restrain men upon mutual injuries, and moderate their fears. The title of
Occupancy, etc.

Sect. 1.
Equality of hopes does not render men enemies.
FRom this equality of ability arises equality of hope in the attaining our
ends, and therefore if any two men desire the same thing, which nevertheless
they cannot both enjoy, they become Enemies.] To understand this, let us look
back to what I have said before, and consider men in their Infancy, borne of
Parents, and having a necessity to be bred up by them, or else they could never
come to be men, with these equalities of abilities, and these hopes he speaks
of; all this while they are under their Parents tuition, and parts of their
dominion; but, perhaps, when they come to the age of discretion, they grow
entire bodies, and set up for themselves, with hopes of their own, I believe,
they have; but what then? two of them may have desires, and then hopes of the
same things; yea, perhaps, one of them the same desires and hopes with his
Father; must he then become an enemy to that other, or to his Parent? this
would make Men to be beasts, or if they have more wit then beasts, to be by
that only enabled to be more barbarous and beastly then Beasts themselves.

Sect. 2.
In the 13. of Genesis, we may observe, how, when by the contention betwixt the
Heardsmen of Abraham and Lot, Nor of desires, as appears by the agreement
between Abraham and Lot.
Abraham saw it would not be convenient for two persons of their opulency to
cohabite together, he therefore gave Lot his choice to take the right or left
hand Country, which he pleased. There can be no doubt but that Abraham was
more potent then Lot, and could have compelled him to have gone whither he
pleased; and there can be no doubt, but, in his choice, he must needs approve
that Plain of Jordan, which Lot had taken, as most commodious for the feeding
their Cattle, in the which their wealth principally consisted; but yet he gave
him his choice, which, if he had been of Mr. Hobbes his mind, or a man of his
forming, he would not have done; a Beast would not have done it, a man, of base
disposition would not, but a man of a noble and generous heart did^ Certainly
men will not be enemies for every thing they desire or hope for, but give way
to others in many things, much less do, as he speaks presently after [ and in
the way to the end which is principally their own conservation, and sometimes
their delectation only.]

Sect. 3.
That such Monsters have been in morality, is as apparent as other Monsters in
nature; but that it should be universally true, in the sons of Nature, Nor
self-conservation, much less delectation.
were to make Nature her self a Monster; that which he speaks, of
Self-preservation, will be discussed more pertinently hereafter; but to say,
that men universally deal so maliciously for delectation, is a most unhappie
assertion; It is true, the passions of men are extremely unruly things, when
they get the dominion, and carry men to all manner of wickedness; but Men are
better then Beasts, and have reason and reasonable wills, by which they can,
and do govern their Passions to act what is fit, not what is delightful
only. From this passion of Hope, he proceeds to another of Fear; thus [ And
from hence it comes to pass that where an Invader has no more to fear then
another man's single power] this is an imperfect sentence (but I will collect
the meaning of it) If one plant, sow, build, others may probably be expected to
come prepared with forces united to dispossess, or deprive him, not only of
the fruit of his labor, but also of his life, or liberty; and the Invader is
in the like danger again of another] Here now have we two passions, Hope and
Fear assaulting every man, and provoking him to do mischief, and how
probable to prevail, I will now examine.

Sect. 4.
It is very evident that hopes and fears are great guides and rulers of humane
actions; and their force and power over us consists principally in the
condition and qualities of the Object of hopes and fears; How, and by what,
Hopes and Fears work upon us.
so that by how much the Object is more desirable or terrible, by so much the
Object works more efficaciously, as a greater good more then a less, a
greater danger more then a less; so only, but the probability of its falling
upon us gives it a great degree of power; for although the falling down of our
houses upon us would be a certain and inevitable destruction; yet, because not
probable, we fear not. What I speak of fear may be applied to hopes, and yet
once again, the powers, that these Objects have, are by Moral persuasions not
by Physical or natural operations, which must certainly do their effects, when
those do not work with more certainty then moral, which may, or may not be.
To come to the business therefore in hand when two men design the same thing,
Not Ahab's, but Jezabels malice destroyed Naboth.
suppose the same commodious seat, if one be possessor of it, and the planter
there may have such a desire of it, being furious, and wicked, as not to be
contented without it, such was the case of Ahab to Naboths vineyard; but yet
this Passi^n of his was not so violent as by sinister means, and the
destruction of Naboth, he would get it, that was an act of malice beyond his,
of Jezabell, as you may read 1 Kings 21. and yet he as wicked a man as almost
ever was. Lo that although men may like, and approve, what another has; yet
the violence of few men's affections runs to such a height in malice, as to do
mischief in so high a nature, for their content, as to destroy a man. I know
to my instance of Ahab it may be objected, Obj.
that he lived in a civil State, in which were Laws, and Ahab durst not act
against them; but in these Cases men suppose no coercive power, but their own
will and force to Govern. To this I answer, Ans.

The title of Occupancy sacred etc.


that first the title of Occupancy is a most sacred and just title, and gives
dominion to the possessor, such as all men, in all Ages, have reverenced; and
although there is no coercive nor punishing power, for such injuries as are
done in that kind, but Conscience; yet that is enough to keep men in awe, as I
shall show you anon. And Ahab, being King over Israel, had no other awe; and
therefore there is seldom such violent desires of another good as does
produce such horrid effects. What I have said of Hopes, Reason secureth men
from fears.
may be applied to Fears; Fears urge men to a thousand desperate actions;
and, certainly, if men were nothing but Beasts, without reason, they could not
be secured from fears, without either destruction of other men, or subduing
them; nay, subduing them were not enough; For as it happens with beasts, that
that Bull, or that Stagge, which is subdued this day, finds a time of revenge
upon the other a little after; so may it be with men, yea it is more dangerous
by so much as men have more wit to effect revenges with. But let us look back,
and we shall find, Who apprehend no danger from any bare possibility of injury.
that Fear is not where is no probability that the feared thing should happen;
not the possibility, but the probability, causes fear; now then when a man is
possessed of any thing, if the new commer to plant by him offer him no
disturbance, what probability is there that he should be disturbed by him? men
are reasonable Creatures, and sociable, without society they can have no
happiness in this world; they know that, if they should have such fear, there
could be no peace to men; and therefore, without injustice done, or violence
offered or menaced, men do not fear, but rejoice at such vicinity; if the
possibility of injury should provoke men to such violence, as he speaks of, men
might fear their servants, their Children, and must by anticipation (as he
speaks presently) take them away, and no man can live secure so long as there
is another man, for there is a poss^bility of destruction to come to any man,
from any man, although not a probability. Which is generally restrained by the
thought of Gods punitive justice.
Let us look back therefore and see that there is in the heart of every man, a
thought of a GOD, who amongst other infinite excellency has punitive justice;
to whom vengeance belongs; and there is a secret consent to that great Axiom,
such measure as you mete shall be meted to you again; this keeps the universal
kind of man in some awe from perpetuating such barbarous acts as he entitles
them unto; and, unless now and then, by some prodigious monster, we see them
not violate these laws in those high kinds which he surmiseth they do; How
Reason or Arms decide the controversy before occupancy
All that he writes now I suppose to be but like rubbidge, cast in the Reader's
way, to hinder his assault upon his Castle of mischief which follows; I
lightly remove them now, but will place my Battery strongly presently; but
because I have spoke only of such cases where one is poss^ssor, and the other
come's with a desire to what he possesses; the case may be otherwise where two
persons shall come with equal desire to enjoy the same place, and equal title,
that is, neither has occupancy; and to this I say, they will either debate it
by reason, or else fight it out, and the strongest arm will get possession,
and, with that, right, not by Conquest, for that gives no title, but by
occupancie, and it will be unjust for any to meddle with it whilst it is in
his possession. Thus much slightly to these things, premised by him to usher
in his unhappy Conclusions. The rest which he says, in order to them, may be
looked upon through the glass of what I have already writ, and will appear of
no force; I shall therefore, to avoid tediousness, step to Page 62. where he
delivers this unheard of Doctrine, until by him uttered.

CHAP. XX.
The Condition of War what, or what sort of men not in it, etc.

[ HEreby it is manifest, that, during the time men live without a common
Power, to keep them all in awe, they are in that condition is called War,
and such a war as is of every man against every man.] First, I will examine
that Phrase ( whilst men live without a common Power to heep them in awe) if
this be understood, as he phraseth it, Three sorts of men, although without a
common humane power to awe them, not in the condition called War.
of all kind of power, then there is no such time; for there is a power Divine,
which always has an invisible rod, which keeps all men in awe from
perpetrating things against that law which is written in their hearts; but if
it be understood, as his discourse seems to intimate, of such a Power as is
humane; we must then p^sse over all men in their Infancy, whom, although they
may have discontents, and fears, and hopes, concerning their Parents, and
their Parents concerning them; yet their natures are framed in such necessities
of their Parents, and their Parents look down upon them with hearts so filled
with kindness and sweetness, and this so settled by nature, that although that
disposition may be hindered in its operation sometimes from working its proper
effects; yet it is seldom, or never, destroyed from its being; and therefore
men in that estate are most peaceable and free from war. We must likewise
leave men linked in that domestique bond of Matrimony, betwixt whom, although
there may be discontents, yet there cannot properly be said hostility; And we
will take men, as is hardly ever known, diverse single persons without any
relation one to the other, but that of humanity, by several wrecks cast upon
the same uninhabited coast; and let us think of these men whether they are all
at a war one with another, before they have done, or received any injury one
from another.

Sect. 2.
How a common interest in humanity may oblige to mutual ^^iendship.
In this Condition, I am confident that these men would be in a state of peace
rather then war, and if one by chance should see another in misery, out of
that common interest they both have in humanity, he would relieve and help the
distressed like a friend, not destroy him as an enemy; and, by that obligation
of another, would strengthen, and secure his own condition more against
misfortunes, then he could by destroying him; and this humanity is writ in
every man's heart, in whom such wicked principles, as his, have not blotted it
out; from this principle it came, that ( Acts 28.) the barbarous people of
Malita entertained St. Paul with such humanity; if they had been of Mr. Hobbes
his mind, they would have killed him, but humanity provoked them to kindness,
and malicious Axioms had not abused their judgments; and therefore man was to
man strange man, such as they had no interest in a friend. I know it may be
objected here, Ob.
that those of Malita were men united in a Commonwealth, and that might cause
them to be so civil. He has taught me to answer this afterward, showing how
all Commonwealths, being independent bodies, are to one another in the state
of war; and therefore other people are to them like other men to each other.
If he should again reply, that they should have neither hopes nor fears from
this; I answer, Repl. Ans.
they might have bor^ hopes to get what they had, and fears that they might
spy out their weaknesses, and many other the like, which Covetousness and
Desire of safety might have suggested to them, but such as, in them, and
ingenious spirits, might easily be controlled by humanity.

Sect. 3.
But he goe's on to prove, that these men are at war one with another (for
says he) [ War consists not in battle only] true, Time being no
essential constitutes no war.
for the School distinguish betwixt Bellum and pugna, fight or battle, and
war, or the act of fighting [but in a tract of time, wherein the will to
contend by battle is sufficiently known: and therefore the notion of time is
to be considered in the nature of war.] He is the most unhappie man in his
manner of defining that ever writ; can any man think that war consists in a
tract of time? It is true, time is necessary to war, it is the measure of all
rest or actions in the world, it is the measure of their existence, how long
they stay and tarry in the world, and so may be reckoned amongst those outward
accommodations with which all natural things are fitted; but it is no essential
part of any: To say, that the nature of war or peace, a Horse, or Tree, or
Men consists in time, were foolish; they are in time measured by time; but time
is not essential constitutively, as his friends the Schoolmen, and University
learning teaches, but consecutively; they do not make these things follow
them; and therefore it was weakly explained by him, when he said, that the
notion of time is to be considered in the nature of wars.

Sect. 4.
But he illustrates this by foul weather (says he) [ the nature of foul
weather lies not in a shower or two of rain, but in an inclination thereto of
many days together: So the nature of war consists not in actual fighting,
but in the known disposition thereto, His instance in foul weather, to
illustrate, erroneous.
during all the time there is no assurance to the contrary.] His instance, by
which he illustrates this Conclusion, is erroneous; for foul weather is not an
inclination of time (as he seems to speak, or else he prove's not, that the
notion of time is to be considered in the nature of war) but of the heavens
in that time; nor is the weather foul if there be only an inclination to
foulness, as hap's in lowering cloudy weather, where is no rain; yet it is
fair, as weather is fair effectively in making the ways fair; and this
distinction is often observed by our writers of Almanacks; when they will be
exact in their Prognostiques of weather, they say, now it is inclinable to
rain, then it will be rain, and when it does rain, or in such a time as
rain has such a predominance to make the ways foul, we call it a foul day
or week; but if there be only a disposition to rain, or so little as allayes
the dust only, we say, for all that, it is fair weather not foul.

Sect. 5.
As his Illustration is to blame, so is his Conclusion; A disposition to war,
before any act of hostility, makes no war.
the disposition to war, no not the known disposition to it, is war, for
that disposition is nothing but an inclination to war; but an actual, or
habitual hostility, not enmity only, makes war; a man may hate another, one
King another, and yet not make war upon him; yet that hatred is a disposition
to war. So that a disposition to war makes not war, and then the knowledge of
it cannot make it other then it is; but then is war, when two Nations endeavor
the subjugation or assaulting one another, or one does it alone; for although
true friendship requires a mutual consent of both parties; yet a war does not,
for war may be, and is commonly, begun by one party, before the other
undertakes it; and we say often, that one Nation makes war, and invade's the
other unprovided. But because he vaunts often of the propriety of speech, His
impropriety of speech.
I may tell him, that war is not properly spoke of single men but Kings or
Nations; for single men hate one another, cantend one with another, fight one
with another, are at enmity one with the other, but not at war, that is proper
to public persons, or Nations, only.

Sect. 6.
What he writes afterward, of the incommodities of war, Men unassured of their
security make not presently provision for a defensive War.
is ingenious, but the application is not rightly made to those men (of which
he speaks) who live without other security then what their own strength, and
their own invention, shall furnish them withal; For let us consider these men
either planting near other men, or alone, we shall still, unless war disturb
them, find them adopting and fitting their habitations for their own profit and
content; if a man should, in an Hermeticall way, live alone, he would fit his
habitation for such a solitary life; if he should live amongst neighbors, he
would accommodate his affairs, the best way he could, to have a neighbourly
friendship with them. The application I cannot see how it can be forced unless
his conclusion, that all men are at war, were granted, for instance we can have
none but of Hermites; but for the plantation of families upon the same
territories with others, we see Abraham and Lot planting amongst the
Canaanites, who, having ground sufficient, lived peaceably with them, and they
fitted themselves with all useful things, for a good time having no war. I
go on with him therefore on the last particle of the 62. Page; he there begins.

CHAP. XXI.
The conceit of an universal war by nature vain. Of the passions and their
objects. The great Lawmakers and his Laws. Justice done among the Americans.
The law of Nature and dictate of Conscience. Of military valor and prudence.
The habits of Justice and Injustice. Of propriety, occupancy, etc.

Sect. 1.
[ IT may seem strange to some man, who has not well weighed these things,
that nature should thus dissociate and render men apt to invade and destroy one
another; and he may therefore not wresting to this inference made from the
passions, desire, perhaps, to have the same confirmed by Experience.] It is
true, An universal war between all individuals of mankind never yet
experimented.
the inference from those passions being too weak to prove his conclusion,
that every man is at war with every man, we can hardly assent to such an
universal proposition concerning a war with all, by all men, the practice of
which was never experimented by any. Let us see his instance briefly: it
consist's in three things [that men travel armed, Nor is it proved by Mr.
Hobbes's instances.
they keep their doors locked (these two might be spared in my particular, who
do neither) and that in his house he lock's his chests; by these, says he,
this man accuses mankind as much by his deeds as he does by his words; he
saye's so, but I say no. For he accuses not mankind of this wickedness, that
all the world, and each man naturally is at war one with another, but these
mistrust that there are some evil and wicked men in the world; these know men
may be ill; by these actions, they express it; but he conclude's they are so;
for, certainly, as Love and Friendship are mighty excellencies in the
conversation of man with man, so hatred and wars the greatest evil which he
affirme's to be in every man toward every man.

Sect. 2.
[ But, says he, neither of us accuse nature in it, the desires, and other
passions of man are in themselves no sins, no more are the actions which
proceed from those desires, till they know a Law that forbids them, which, till
laws be made, they cannot know: nor can any Law be made till they have agreed
upon the person that shall make it.] Thus he; we agree both, What in the
passions mak^^ Sins, which are not such in themelves.
that the passions are not sins, nor the acts proceeding out of them; men may
love, hate, fear, hope, etc. but the misapplication of the act to the wrong
objects, to love that we should hate, or hate what we should love; or to
mistake the degrees, over-love that which is less lovely, or less love that
which is more lovely, and the like, this is it make's a sin; now the frame and
constitution of the Objects of our passions is either such by Divine
Institution, The several constitutions in the objects of our passions what and
whence.
or humane; by divine, that is, the amiableness and fitness things have to man
by that gift of God in nature, or else in the positive law of God, in the book
of God: That which is by Humane institution, is that which humane laws make
desirable or hateful; of the first sort are these combinations of Parents and
Children, of Brethren one amongst another; yea of men in general as men, for
men are all made with natural abilities to do one another good; of the second
sort are Sacraments, and all such rites, which, having no force in their
natural constitution, receive a great loveliness and sweetness, from the
Covenants of God to us in them; of the last sort are all our proprieties, as
goods, and such things, which by neither God in nature, not his written book,
are appropriated to us, but are only given us by the law of the Land wherein we
live.

Sect. 3.
What is said of Desire, may be applied to any other passion which, affecting
any thing contrary to these rules, Affected ignorance of the law a sin.
is a sin; now what he adde's [ until they know a Law] is not universally
material, for Ignorantia juris non excusat, such as he are so far from
knowing, that they will have contradictoriam ignorantiam, they will deny, and
oppose the very bond of Nature, and teach what is cross to it; not knowledge
in such cases is a sin, and the mother of such a sin as leade's to Perdition,
when men hide their eyes, and will not see the Sun, but draw vailes betwixt
them and it [ which, says he, until Laws be made, cannot be known] but there
is no man made without a law to guide him. [ Nor, says he, can any Law be made
until they have agreed upon the person that shall make it] As men, who are
borne in a Commonwealth, Every man borne under a Law maker and a Law.
do not choose their lawmaker, but submit to him, whose government they were
under; so every man is borne a Citizen of the world, and he must submit to that
great Governor and Lawmakers of the world, God, and that law he has made for
him to do; so that, whether a man agree upon a Lawmakers, or no, there is a
lawmakers, and a Law, under which he is borne, and to which he ought to submit.
Page 63. he undertake's to satisfy another question thus.

Sect. 4.
[ It may peradventure be thought, there was never such a time or condition of
men as this is, and I believe it was never generally so over all the world; but
there are many places where they live so now, for the savage people in many
places of America, except the government of small families, the concord whereof
depends on natural lust, have no government at all, and live at this day in
that brutish manner as I said before.) Thus far he; His instances in the
Americans is false, The Americans have Kings and justice exeeuted amongst them.
for they had diverse Kings and Kingdoms, and have Justice executed amongst
them for misdemeanors, as may appear to any who reade's their stories; but
howsoever, although they had but private families, yet it does not follow, that
they should be at war with all other; Private families not at war with the
Kings and Nations among whom they live.
we see Abraham's, Lot's, private families, lived peaceably in that land, where
were two Nations, the Canaanites and the Perizites cohabiting that Country with
them, Genesis 13. Nay, not so only, but little families may live at peace with
mighty Kings, so you may see Judges the 4. and 17. That there was peace betwixt
Iabin a mighty King, who brought a puissant Army into the field, and the house
of Heber the Kenite; it was a most unworthy expression, when he said, that the
concord of these families depends on natural lust; The concord of which has
a better dependence then upon lust.
no, it depend's upon the natural authority of Parents, the natural duty of
Children, the reciprocal returns of obedience and protection betwixt Master
and Servant. I hasten to his, and my maine design.

Sect. 5.
[ Howsoever, says he, it may be perceived what manner of life there would be
where there were no common Power to fear, by the manner of life, which men,
that have formerly lived under a peaceable Government, use to degenerate into a
civil war.] This instance nothing illustrate's his conclusion, The
exorbitances of a Civil War prove not men to be in a polemical state by
nature.
to prove that men of themselves are at war by an instance drawn from a civil
war, or indeed from any other war; for the conditions of war must needs be
with those that are at war; but he should prove that they are such before any
warlike act, or menaces, has passed betwixt them, and that he seeme's to do
in what fallows.

Sect. 6.
[ But (says he) though there had never been any time wherein particular men
were in a conditirn of war one against another: yet in all time Kings and
persons of sovereign Authority, because of their independency, are in continual
jealousies, and in the state and posture of Gladiators, having their weapons
pointing, and their eyes fixed one on another.] This was so handsomely
expressed, The mutual jealousies of Sovereigns render them not like Gladiatours
in a direct posture of war.
that I could willingly have let it alone; but least it should, by the
ingenuity of it, steal a credit of his opinion into a Reader, I must censure
it as nothing to the purpose; for all this can prove no war, but that these
Sovereigns imagine each other may be wicked, and Faith-breakers, just as
before, because there may be Thieves in his family, he lock's his Chest. This
prove's only that they are in a posture of war, but not in war it self; or,
indeed, this is not absolutely a posture of war, for that require's men
pressed, drawn into the field. And by this reckoning all Nations should be at
war one with another; and indeed there is the same condition betwixt them and
particular persons, who have no supreme coercive power amongst them to
restrain them; but to say, that all Nations are at war one with another, even
those who are in peace, were to say, as he did before, that all things are
motion, even rest its self. But now I come to the upshot which he aimed at, and
I think most wicked, for which cause it was necessary for me lightly to s^eep
away the rubbige, which being done, I come to his following discourse.

Sect. 7.
[ To this war of every man against every man this also is consequent that
nothing can be unjust.] He must understand this of such men who are not joined
in a politic society; now I deny, that there is nothing unjust to such men,
he affirme's it; let us consider his proofs: he prove's it thus [ the actions
of right or wrong, justice and injustice, have there no place] this is the same
in other words, but his proof lye's in what followe's [ where there is no
common Power, there is no Law, where no law, no injustice] thus he. Conscience
dictate's to men what is right and wrong; what law and common power they must
submit to.
To this I answer, that there is no man born in this world without a Law and a
common Power over him and others; the Law is that writ in their hearts, and
this is it which St. Paul speake's, Romans 2.15. Which shewe's the law written in
their hearts, that law of Nature that practique law which is writ in the heart
of every man, and this common Power is GOD; and therefore, as St. Paul speaks
there, their Conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts, the mean
while, accusing or excusing one another; where there is evidence accusing,
excusing, there is supposed a common Power, so that there is a Common Power,
and this secretly acknowledged by men; and that he has given them certain
laws for the breach of which there is a horror and dread, insomuch as a man
cannot live, or it is a prodigy to see a man without all Conscience of the
principal and fundamental rules of reason; although men may do and act
against those Laws, yet until a long custom of living have hardened their
hearts, or some such wicked principles, as his, have, by degrees, stolen an
approbation in their their understandings (by degrees, I say, for I think it
not possible to be done in an instant) until then it is not pospossible for
men to sin against these without an accusation of their Consciences. He
proceed's.

Sect. 8.
[ Force and fraud are in war the two cardinal vertues] In a war actually waged
force is of great use, Military Va^our and Prudence, degenerated into Force
and fraud, lose the nature, and deserve not the name of the the two Cardinal
virtues in war.
and may well be called one of the best hinges upon which war is moved; yea, if
we take force not for strength but violence, as I think he does, but in the
posture of war, or in war only in expectation, violence is the chief support
of all injustice; but certainly it is most improperly called a virtue in any
but a most forced and violent way; for virtues are those things which perfect
the soul, which make the work and worker good; but no force does that, neither
does it assist in doing, but it is indifferent to good or bad; then again,
force, even in war, may be a help to increase the wickedness of it; if the war
be unjust, it is doubly evil, which is fortified with force; If the acts of
that war be cruel, it is doubly bloody, which is effected by force: And then
for fraud, although stratagems are lawful, yet falsehood in war is wicked,
which is comprehended under that notion of fraud, as to promise one thing, and
do another; all Stratagems have a double sense, by which the enemy deceive's
himself, taking the visard from the true face; but they, having a true face
discernable, are not all visards and forces; where there is no war engaged in,
but only some private end or design of one man against another, they are in
themselves wicked, and provoke the just vengeance of a war from the injured
party upon them. He should have said valor and prudence were cardinal virtues
in war, but force and fraud are these degenerated, and when they get these
names of force and fraud, they never retain that excellent nature of being
Virtues.

Sect. 9.
He urges further; Justice and Injustice (says he) are none of the faculties
neither of the body, Justice and Injustice, no faculties but habits, and may be
in a military person.
nor the mind.] I think if he take Faculty, as he seems to do, for an innate
quality, no man ever said they were; therefore his proof is needless, when he
come's on [ if they were, they might be in a man that were alone in the world,
as well as his Senses and Passions] although they are not innate faculties, but
acquisite habits, I mean the virtue justice, or the vice injustice; yet the
habits may be, when they are acquired with that man who is alone, and when he
is alone, though, to act accordingly, require's a present Object; now
denominations are given from the habits, not the acts. He proceed's [ They are
qualities that relate to men in society, not in solitude] our dispute is of a
third sort of men, neither in such Society as a civil policy, nor a Solitude,
but men without all relations, of being under one common sublunary governance,
and yet men cohabiting in the same neighborhood, where may be perpetrated
those horrid and unjust actions of Murder and Theevery, etc. And again,
although the acts of Justice do suppose other men to do justice upon; yet it
is other men, not other men in the same City, or polities; and when, by the use
of those acts, a habit is got, it remaine's in Solitude.

Sect. 10.
He draw's another Conclusion [ Hence thus it is consequent also to the same
Condition, that there be no propriety, no dominion, no mine and thine distinct,
but only that to be every man's that he can get, and for so long as he can keep
it.] The wickedness of this Proposition will best appear betwixt two States,
two neighbor Nations, Nations have propriety in Dominions.
they certainly have distinct Dominions, and it is injustice for one to take by
force from the other, or detain by force what he has gotten ill, which is
against all the consent of men from the beginning of the world; now these two
Nations are without any other coercive power in this world, and from that
reason are justly paralleld by him to such men as he formerly spoke of; and
therefore these Nations should have no propriety (as he explaines himself) not
in any thing: Consider therefore Genesis 12. and the 20. Chap. How in two places
Abraham's wife Sarah was like to have been taken from him by the Kings of those
Nations where he lived; Persons in their wives.
but God punished them for it; and they acknowledged it would have been a great
sin to have layne with another man's wife. Mr. Hobbes would have pleaded with
God, there is no propriety in any thing; All men have title to all things;
where is no coercive power upon earth, there is no injustice: the woman is any
man's who can get her by fraud or force, so long as he can keep her; they who
have no common power above them (as these had not) to make Laws, which might
appropriate interests to particular persons, these are bound to no law, nor
have any propriety but such as force gives them; and then both Abimelek and
Pharaoh, or other of them, might lawfully have kept Sarah, Abraham's wife from
him; but the Principles of the law of Nature say it was unjust, and they did
not do it. Thus it fared concerning the propriety of Wives; now we will
examine what propriety men had in Estates, where was no such humane authority:
And estates.
without doubt the first that ever gave outward Laws, to govern a Nation by,
was Moses; and I conceive the Decalogue to be like our Magna Charta, which was
not a new law, but a brief and pithy expression of what was the old law, by
which this people was governed; so were the Ten Commandments not a new law,
but an expression in tables of that moral law of nature, which was writ in the
heart of men before, and practiced before his time; in particular this of
Stealing, which injured the possessor of Meum and tuum, mine and thine; you may
read a most excellent passage in the 23. of Genesis with what civility of
discourse, and reciprocal courtesies, Abraham bought the field in Machpelah of
Ephron the Hittite. First I collect thence, that Abraham judged there was a
legal interest in Ephron, for else he would not have paid such a round price
for it as four hundred shekels of Silver; and then you may observe how sacred
amongst all people the preservation of interest was, for in the last of Genesis
you shall find, that Jacob, when he died in Egypt, a great way off, in another
Nation, having, both he and his, left the Land, near two hundred years after
the purchase, when he and his, without doubt, were not known, scarce remembered,
Jacob gave order for the burying of his body there, and it was performed
without any disturbance; so sacred did those people without any positive law,
but the principles of nature, observe the particular interest of particular
men, even such who at the time of the Purchase were but sojourners among them,
and at the time of the last usage were not so much as cohabitants, but
strangers in another Country and Nation; so that we see as men have had always
Consciences which directed them in their actions; so those Consciences have had
a sense of intruding upon another's interest, and Abraham was assured that it
was such amongst them; for, upon that presumption, he paid so great a price for
that field.

Sect. 11.
If it should be asked, how men should come to get these interests? I will not
here scan all ways; Their title to which may be various.

That of Occupancy most evident.


one is evident, that is, Occupancy, taking possession of it first, for all the
things in this world being but Bona utilia, and the profit they have is their
service to man, he who first gets possession of them is Lord of them; thus
Fowls and Fishes, even in planted Nations, which are no man's possessions being
caught by any man, are his to make profit, and when one man has caught them,
that they are his possession, it is thievery to rob him of them. I speak not
here of Dear, Conyes, Hares, nor Fishes in ponds, etc. which are impaled, and
so for their habitation, by our laws, are made to pay their host with their
lives; nor such things which our laws indulging the pleasures of Gent. and men
of quality, have appropriated to certain persons and places, as Pheasants, and
Partridges, and the like, but whatsoever no national particular Law has given
to another, that the law of Nature gives to the first possessor: and this law
men find before any positive law of Nations in the practice of the world; so
that then it is apparent, that, without positive laws, or an outward humane
coercive power, the law of Nations has always given a propriety in this
world's goods to the sons of men.

Thus I have passed my opinion upon his 13. Chapter, and I think have given
reasons for what I spoke; but if this be not enough, let the Reader consider
what I shall speak to the next Chapter, and that will the more fully discribe
the mist of his opinions, and confirm mine more stronger.

Censures upon the 14th Chapter of LEVIATHAN, which is entitled, The first and
second natural Laws and of Contracts, which thus begin's.
CHAP. XXII.
Concerning the pretended necessity in Nature for the preservation of life. The
prospect of an happiness beyond it; Death represented more terrible than it is,
etc.

Sect. 1.
[ THE right of Nature, which Writers commonly call jus Natural, is the
liberty each man has to use his own power, as he will himself, for the
preservation of his own nature; that is to say, his own life, and consequently
of doing any thing which in his own judgment and reason he shall conceive to
be the aptest means thereunto.]

Here is a description of the right of Nature, which is that he says, The
right of Nature extends farther then to the preservation of life.
Writers call Jus Natural: I believe this Gentleman never in his life read Jus
Natural so described in any Author. It is true, to preserve a man's own life is
a branch of the right of nature, but it does not contain the whole nature of
it, as if the right of nature extended to nothing else but the preservation of
a man's own life; there are many other things which the right of nature enables
us to do; but because I find this question in my opinion more methodically and
Schollarly delivered in his Book entitled De Copore Politico, Cap. 1. I shall
therefore consider that first; and, having cleared that discourse, apply my
self to this description, and I will begin with his 6. Number.

That number begins thus.

Sect. 2.
[ Forasmuch as necessity of nature makes men to will and desire that which is
good for themselves, and to avoid that which is hurtful, but most of all the
terrible enemy of nature, Death, from whom men expect the loss of all power,
and also the greatest of bodily pain in the loosing. Several acceptions of
Necessity and the different effects of it accordingly.
] The phrase, which I here censure first, is that necessity makes us do this: I
know this word Necessity is often used for what we term want or poverty,
because such a man need's somewhat, therefore we say he is in necessity; and in
this sense there may be some truth in that Proposition; for because men's lives
have lack of supplies; and, according to this Gentleman, all the world are his
enemies, or, what is the truth, no man will have so much care to supply him as
himself, therefore he must do it; but then take necessity as it opposes
contingency, which is the common logical sense, it is absolutely false, for
many men throw and take away their own lives; now that which is necessarily
done, cannot be otherwise; men cannot choose but do what they do out of
necessity; the phrase were much more proper to say, that the law of nature
enjoyne's them to provide for themselves; for the great Natura naturans, God,
as I said before, Nothing necessary that God has not provided for by some Law.
know's our necessities, and like a wise lawmakers, makes laws to provide for
them, and so infinitely wise are those laws that what he has not, by some law
or other, provided for, it is not necessary for any man whatsoever; and
certainly therefore where is no lawful and honest way to preserve it, life its
self is not necessary; he seems therefore to express himself better in
Corpore politico then in Leviathan, because in Leviathan he restrain's this
right of Nature only to the preservation of his own life, but in this, I now
write against, he says not only but [most of all his own life] other things he
may have a right unto, but most of all, or chiefly the preservation of his own
life, or rather the avoiding of death.

Sect. 3.
Necessity of nature makes not every particular man desirous to preserve his
life.
What he says, that ( necessity of nature makes us desire our own good, and
avoid that which is hurtful) is true in that generality, but applied to any
particular, is false; for there is no particular but may appear to some men
good, and to others hurtful: even these things, life or death, are such; some
men have thought this temporal life a misery clothed with these circumstances
they possess it with, like a rotten house, which, when the winds and rain
drives in, is worse then the open fields; like a Prison, it were better have no
house then that; such is the body to the soul; and therefore men may, and have
often wished to be delivered out of it, and death to some men is as desired as
a freedom from a Jail. This Gentleman talks up and down in these books, not
only like a natural man, but like the worst of them, and the wickedest; for
wise men among them have written much in contempt of these sensual temporal
things, in which he places the only aim and happiness of man.

Sect. 4.
It being (...) in nature the principal of man's happiness.
Certainly, even in Nature the life of man is not the principal thing of man's
happiness, and then not of man's intention and care; for Life is a thing which
a man enjoyes in common with Beasts and Trees, and therefore if man's
happiness should be in that, he were no better, yea much worse then they whose
excellency consists in a relation to man; to live only, is to be a Beast, a
Plant only; but to live virtuously and reasonably, to glorify that God who
gave him those abilities by which his life is happy, that is the end of man,
and of man's life, which he is to leave then when he cannot enjoy it upon these
conditions; and to a Christian man, as to the best of Philosophers who had
thoughts and assurance of Eternity, this life has been reputed of little
value; and to die no misery; because it is but the passage to a better and more
spiritual life, although perhaps there may be some difficulties in opening the
gate; yet it is not to be compared with the happiness it admits into, nay, it
has been of such esteem amongst men of honor always, that they would choose
to die virtuously, rather then live dishonourably; Instances would be numerous
out of the Roman story; so that it is impossible, in that absolute sense,
without limitation, in which he speaks it, to be true, that this is the whole
right of Nature, as his Leviathan or his chief or principal as his Corpus
politicum, to preserve this life, or to avoid this enemy, death, which, for
multitudes, may, and, for not a few reasons, ought to be despised: These
phrases which he uses,

Sect. 5.
From whom we expect the less of power] he meane's, Nor the power lost with it
considerable in respect of the spiritual activity and perfection gaind by Death.
Death [ and the greatest of bodily pains in the loosing] must be censured
next; and first of the first. By death we do not loose all power; yea without
doubt, like a man out of prison, he is more active and able then he was within;
so is the soul, when it is broke out of this jail or dunghill, its natural
corruptible body; nor can he say that he meant bodily power, for then he would
not have left out that word Bodily in this which he joined with Pain in his
following sentence; men, without question, who have hopes of that better life
hereafter, do not expect the loss of all power by this death, but rather the
increase of it; and therefore, suppose he should say he meant bodily power,
which indeed must needs be lost by death, yet who is troubled to loose a bag of
Silver, when in its room shall be left a bag of Gold; to loose bodily power,
and gain spiritual? It was said of our Druids in England, who taught the
Immortality of the soul, Ignavi est rediturae parcere vitae, it was a poor
dull thing, to spare that life which would return again; but then if they had
pryed into, and could have considered, the glorious immortal existence, which
men shall have hereafter for the mortal and contemptible being here, it might
have been said that it were not only a dull, but a beastly thing for a man so
much to affect the sensual pleasures of this fleshly life, as to be unwilling
for the loss of them to gain Spiritual perfections; we cannot then say that
we expect to loose by death all our power; and if we do leave bodily powers, we
are not loosers, but gainers by it.

Sect. 6.
Which is not so terrible, and painful, as pretended.
His next phrase is [ That by death we expect in the losing these Powers, the
greatest bodily pain.] This Gentleman I guess has only looked upon Death in
those horrid vizards, and disguises which fearful men masque it with, he has
not been so often in the house of mourning as I have, and there made this
observation, that Death is not so horrid as many men conceit it, nor the pains
so great, that Death is not so fearful, is apparent, not only in experience of
those Martyrs who have dyed for the glory of CHRIST, and so by their blessed
sufferings for him have had an assurance that they shall reign with him; but
even in those who with heroic spirits have confronted Death in politic
concernments, yea sought it, which showed, that there is not a necessity of
nature to preserve Life, or that they expected the greatest pain in the losing
it. I could fill diverse sheets with instances both ancient and modern, these I
let pass, lest they kick me in the teeth whilst I follow them in the Chase;
for the former; consider how many wicked men have killed themselves for fear
of worse pains alive, so Sardanapalus, so Cleopatra, so Nero, Ancient
instances.
multitudes esteeming the pains of Death deliverance from the pains of
unhappie life, and themselves made choice of death upon such Conditions; but
take one instance, where men were not concerned in the benefit of death
themselves, but took it in relation to others good; we may read in the life of
Otho, or rather in his death, that when after his loss in that great and fatal
battle betwixt his forces and those of Vitellius, he being retreated, and
discontented, The most signal that of Otho and his soldiers
his Soldiers flocked to him, beseeching him to head them again, and regaine
the loss of that day, promising how that they were all ready to dye in that
cause, with, and for him, if there should be necessity; and, to give him
assurance of what they said, one of the most obscure and meanest sort of
Soldiers drew his sword and killing himself told him, know O Caesar, that we
are all provided thus to die for thee! this man had no end for himself, but
only to encourage Otho, either for his Countries good, or his own, to engage
again; yet go on, and we shall find that Otho, unmoved with this or any thing
else killed himself likewise, and his soldiers carrying him to his funeral
Pile, many more slew themselves there to dye with him; so that as love of his
Country, or Otho's imagined virtues provoked the first, so a bare love to his
person inflamed the rest to dye with him; now certainly there could not be a
necessity of Nature in these men to expect the greatest pains in death, nor
indeed can I think there is such pain; Old men wear out questionless like a
Candle; those deaths which this Gent. speaks of, are by the assaults of
enemies, or condemnation of superiors; these are sudden, and, although there
should be great pain, yet, finishing their work quickly, are to be less
valued; but I do not think that there is such pain, and therefore, as it is
reported of Cato, so it happens to many, that when they have wounded themselves
and are somewhat helped, Cato's double attempt to dispatch himself.
they yet kill themselves again; for so it was with Cato, as Plutarch describes
him, after his wounding himself and fall from his Bed, that his bowels gushed
out, and his Physician, having found them unhurt, had put them up into their
own place again, he returning to himself (sure he was in the porch of death,
and had viewed it thoroughly) thrust his Physician away, tare his wound wider,
let out his bowels, and with them his life; this is familiar in Common
experience; now if there were so much pains in death, although they who were
ignorant of it might easily adventure upon it, yet not they who knew it, as
Cato and those other; for, without doubt, the pains of death were passed by
Cato, when his Physician came to him, and he had lost his senses; so likewise
the death of Arria, Paelus his wife, which is Celebrated by Martials excellent
Epigram.

Cas^a suo gladium cum traderet Arria Paeto,
Quem de visceribus traxerat ipsa suis:
Creed mihi vulnus quod feci non dolet inquit, Arria'^ magnanimity in being a
like precedent to her husband Paetus.

Sed quod tu facies, hoc mihi Paete dolet.
The story goes thus, she stole to her Husband in prison, bring's him a sword
under her Coat, invite's him to kill himself with it, he was fearful, she to
encourage him, draws her sword, runne's it into her own body first, gives her
self a deadly wound, then give's it him with this high expression of kindness.

Believe me, Paetus, this wound grieves not me,
That wound's my grief which must be made by thee.
Now although we may allow the manner, the sweetness, the elegancy of this
kindness, to be the Poets, yet the ground of the expression we may conceive to
be real, that she desired to have her Husband dye (as some thought)
honorably, which he, having received some of Mr. Hobbes his Principles, was
fearful to do; she encouraged him to it by her own example, and then told
him, it was no hard matter to dye. Now if it had been so full of pain, as Mr.
Hobbes would have it, that pain would not have given her leave to have
attended his good in the midst of it. To the same purpose I can tell a story
of a Child of mine own, somewhat above four years old, who being sickly, I put
out to a neighbors house, in whose care I confided, to attend her; she grew
weaker and weaker unto death, and almost immediately before her death the man
of the house coming home from his business, she called the woman, whom she
usually called, old Mother: old Mother, said she, go give the old man his
breakfast, he will be angry else; and leave such a boy to rock me in my Cradle,
and so straightway dyed. A modern i^stance in a young child.
This is my Collection, if death had been so painful, this Child could not
have had so much leisure from the anguish of it, as to have attended that ease
of her own rocking, or that kindness to the old man*

Sect. 7.
I have (I thank God) seen diverse dye without any apprehension of any great
pains in them, Death seiseth upon men like sleep.
yea like a sleep, so has Death seized upon them, so like sleep, as by the
bystanders it could not be discerned from it, and has made me often think
that Death is to a dying man, as sleep to a sleepie, and as much desired; when
the body has been tired out with long labor it has so gone to his long rest,
which to us who have assurance of the Resurrection, is no other; and to this
purpose, I remember a Story related by Plutarch, that when Diogenes was toward
his death, Diogenes takes them for brother and Sister*
having taken his Cicuta which was the sleepie medicine that he, and Socrates,
and diverse others used, his Physician raising him up even as he was about to
die, and asking him whether he felt any trouble, Diogenes answered, no; for,
says he, the brother ushers in the sister, meaning he was asleep, as men seem
to us many times before their death. And I can second this Story with another,
out of mine own family, of a Son of mine who was but two years old; and when
death laid hands upon him, he still cried out to go to sleep; now he would
sleep in this man's arms, then on the Bed; sleep is often called an Image of
Death, but death came to him in the image of sleep; he had been often acquainted
with sleep, had never heard Death abused by those invectives which sensual men
use against it; and when Death came, A young child mistook one for the other.
he took it for sleep; nay, so like (to many) is that repose of death to that
of sleep, that when they are forced from it by the importunate clamours,
Misrepresentations make it otherwise apprehended.
or halings and pullings of friends, it is just as a man awaked from sleep, and
many men have complained of it as of an unjust violence. It is therefore the
ugly Sceletons and pictures of death which men see, and the abusive language
and Rhetorique which has been used toward it, which makes death so fearful,
as it is, amongst men; and therefore I could tell of some who having heard
death in the common manner calumniated, when upon their deathbed they have
been told of its approach, have wondered that that was death which had so little
anguish and grief in it; I do not here say that no men have pain in death,
there are three periods of time into which death may be divided.

Sect. 8.
There is that tract of time when first a sickness gets such a head as it is
deadly; The three periods of death.
there is secondly that interim in which man grows insensible; and there is,
thirdly, that instant in which the soul of man is separated from the body: in
regard of which last it was truly spoke of Seneca, when he said, Death should
not be fearful, which, when it comes, is not discerned; for Death taken in
this last acceptance cannot be perceived, no not in the second, but taking
Death in the first way, it is many times more, many times less painful, of
which I would dilate Physically, but avoid tediousness; It is a thing as
apparent, as almost death its self, that sometimes in that tract of time there
may be pain, and most often is; but there are greater pains, I believe, to many
people that outlive their sicknesses, then those when diseases grow deadly; and
I am persuaded that the same disease, unless by wounds (and many times in them
too) I say the same disease is most often more painful when it is curable before
it be deadly, In which of them, and when otherwise pain most affects the sick.
then afterward, because the spirits are quicker, and the man more sensible;
and therefore I conclude, that it is not true, that there is a necessity of
nature which makes men in general avoid death in general, as the thing by
which he must needs expect the greatest pain; for it often happens that there
is little pain; and people that have dyed with a sense of deaths ugliness, and
so, with some impatience, I have found complaining of common accidents, and
such which had no participation of death in them, and no cooperation to the
dissolution of soul and body by death, as Aches in particular parts, sometimes
they were galled, and that troubled them; sometimes that there were clods or
hardness in the Bed, etc. All which showed that these pains, not those of
Death, were more sensible then even death its self.

Sect. 9.
In what cases life should not ^e pre^er'd to Death.
[He proceeds, It is not against reason that a man does all he can to preserve
his own body and limbs both from death and paine] had he put in that little
word and esteemed a little thing by him, ( justly and honestly) he had said
truth; but alas else how unreasonable a thing it is, that a man, to save
himself from a little pain, should act things prejudicial to the glory of God,
the public good, or else some greater good of his own; any man, who has
sense of any thing but sense, and unworthy ease, cannot choose but apprehend
that the greater good should be chosen before the less, such are those before
specified. Therefore in such Cases that they, for pain or death its self, are
relinquished is against reason. What he adde's [ And that which is not against
reason we call right, etc.] I agree to; for certainly there is no wrong which
is not against reason; but his deduction [ It is therefore a right of Nature,
that every man may preserve his own life and limbs with all the power he hath]
This deduction, by what is already said, cannot be true, but when his life and
limbs are not opposed by some greater good.

CHAP. XXIII.
Of using or misusing means in order to their end. The regulation of man's
judgment in it. The preservation of life and estate when necessary. Of right
and wrong, Law, etc.

Sect. 1.
1. I Come now to Number 7. which begins thus [ And because where a man has
right to the end, and the end cannot be attained without the means, that is,
without such things as are necessary to the end, it is consequent that it is
not against reason, and therefore right, for a man to use all means, and do
whatsoever action is necessary for the preservation of his body.] How vile and
illogicall is this; had he proved that the body were the end of man: or,
instead of body, had he said, for the preservation of that end, his axiom,
explained thus, might have borne him out in it; but, as it is pu^, there is no
connection; for suppose a man has right to the end, his own happiness, and by
that right likewise to all means which conduce to it; yet unless this body
can be proved to be that end, his application of it to the body is of no force.
Well; I will examine his Aphorism. First he, who has right to the end, has
not right to all means of getting it, is apparent; He that has right to the
end, has not right to all means whatsoever in the attaining that end.
for he who has right to an estate, or an house, has not right to take it by
force, he must only use legal means for the obtaining and preserving it, and
so, though a man have right to his body or life, yet he has no right to
preserve it by unlawful actions; It is a most just rule of law, that a man
must so use his own, as he must not hurt another; a man has right to water
and a Meadow, but he must not so use his water and his meadow, as by
overflowing his meadow he should drown his neighbors Corn. So although a man
have right to his life, yet this right is not of such a transcendent power as
to enable him, for the preservation of that life, to hurt others and destroy
their lives.

But once again, for further and clearer explication of that rule he gives
concerning an end let us observe, The ultimate end excepted.
that it has no truth but concerning the last end, and in that it has; for
since all men's actions are for an end, that is, his summum bonum, his
happiness, every man, out of necessity of nature, does, what he does, for it,
and the utmost he can for it; but this life or body is not man's happiness, and
for any second end, there being no necessity of the end it self, there is much
less of any means which conduce to it; and therefore of such ends, of which
nature man's temporal life and body are, there is no manner of truth in it, no
more then if we should say, it were right for a man to do what he can, any
thing to obtain pleasure, or profit, upon which he sets his heart.

Sect. 2.
His 8. Numb. must be likewise examined which says [ Also every man by right
of nature is judge himself of the necessity of the means, and of the greatness
of the danger. This has some truth in it, and yet not to be so understood, He
that judges by the right of Nature has a law of Nature to limit and regulate
him in that judgment.
that by right of nature a man may judge what he will, and accordingly act, and
what he acts is right, as he seems to imply here, and from hence enforces
afterward; for as in our judicatures there must use be made of Judges, and the
decrees of those Judges will regulate and govern our possessions; yet those
Judges have rules by which their judicatures should be regulated, and what they
act contrary to those rules, or Laws, although it may be effected, yet it is
wicked; so it is in those, no doubt; but every man will (in such an impossible
state as he supposes man) judge of the means and necessity, but yet there is
a law of nature in every man, by which his judgment should be guided, and what
he judges, though never so congruent to his will, contrary to this law, is not
right; so that, as a Judge, though what he judges must be performed, and he
has power to judge what he thinks fit; yet he has right to judge only
according to the law of that Nation which gave him the power of being a Judge,
all other judgment is by power, but not by right; so is it with this man, he
may act against the law of nature for the preservation of his life or Limb,
but if not right, it is wicked to do so. The Argument he brings for proof of
this Conclusion convinces not me. [ For, says he, if it be against reason
that I be Judge of mine own danger my self, To which he is obliged by Reason.
then it is reason that another may be Judge, etc.] It is reason, say I, that
in such a Case I am Judge, but it is reason likewise, that I judge according to
Law, and make my will be guided by reason, not my reason regulated by my will;
because it is mine, it is not therefore right; but because mine according to
the law of nature and right reason; of which he himself afterward grants,
there are diverse laws both of men in society, to men single, and to men that
live together, although not united in a policy.

Sect. 3.
In his 9. Number he affirms [ As a man's judgment in right of nature is to be
employed for his own benefit, When the law of Nature for preservation may be
dispensed with etc.
so also the strength, etc. of every man is then rightly employed when he uses
it for himself.] To use the Phrase of the time, this Gent. is very selfish, and
indeed there is some reason in what he writes; for as his judgment, so his
strength, etc. but his judgment is to be employed according to the law of
nature only for himself, and so his strength; when some greater good shall be
proposed to him, the good of his family, his Nation, the glory of God in his
virtuous death, then this life is to be neglected and contemned; as a limb is
to be lost rather then a life, the less good rather then the greater, so a
private life rather then that of a Nation. But his Argument is feeble and of no
force, when he says [ Else a man has no right to preserve himself, As the
right for a man's preserving some piece of his estate.
] for although it be right for a man to preserve himself, yet not with those
other greater losses; it is right for a man to preserve each piece of his
estate, yet to preserve it by force, or loss of a Sons life or his own, when
that piece of his estate shall be inconsiderable, it is not right for him to
do it; In a word, a man's understanding, strength, or whatsoever a man has, he
has right to bestow upon the preservation of this life; but then when they are
not called for by some more excellent and more desirable good then this life,
then they are to be bestowed upon that better employment, not this.

Sect. 4.
Now I am arrived at his 10. and last Number, which I mean to handle in this
Chapter, which begins thus [ Every man by nature has right to all things, that
is to say, to do whatsoever he lists, to whom he lists, to possess, use
and enjoy all things he will and can.] A good large Commission: I will examine
it, and, to the understanding it, I will return to his Leviathan, where I left
Page 64. and discussing the beginning of that 14. Chap. lay a foundation for
that truth which this Number occasions me to deliver. First then, let me
observe, that as in the beginning of this Chap. he define's right by equity,
liberty; Mr. Hobbes mistaken in his definition of Right, and division of it
from Law.
so immediately after he define's liberty to be the absence of external
impediments; and again a little after, putting a distinction betwixt right and
law, he says, that Law and Right differ as much as Obligation and Liberty,
which in one and the same matter are inconsistent; in which proposition he
discovers a mighty weakness; for in his definition of right he make's it
nothing but the power and ability to do what he will, as indeed he make's it
afterward, when right implies an equitable title to what he does; and a man
may have right, when he has not power to do accordingly, but is hindered by
external impediments from acting according to his right; that definition of
his is therefore very weak; for what he speaks, that Law and Right are
inconsistent, I am so directly in my judgment against it, that I think there
is no right to any thing but by law, which I will thus confirm by what
follows.

Sect. 5.
Right and wrong, or injury, are opposite terms; so that right is the
convenience or agreement which one thing has with another; What right is
properly, and what wrong.
and wrong is the disagreement; as it is a right line which agree's with the
rule of streightness; a crooked line or a wrong one, which deviates from those
rules; a right shot that which hit's the white, and a wrong which misseth. So
it is a right action which is according to the rules of Actions, and a wrong
which differ's from them. These rules are that we call law, which regulate's
our actions; and when they are done, accordingly they are right, and we have
right to do them; and to this purpose, he said in the preceding Chap. Whence
is proved the consistence of Right with Law.
Where no law, no injustice; and I may say, where can be no injustice, there
can be no justice; contraries appertain to the same subject, and expel each
other out of it. So then, if right be an agreeing with some rule or law, it is
so far from being inconsistent with it, that it cannot be without it. As in a
Commonwealth, a man has only such a right to use or act any thing as the law
of that Commonwealth gives him; so in the generality of this world, a man can
only have right to do or act such things which the universal law of nature
direct's or impowers him to do. Thus his Leviathan being touched, concerning
this point, I will return to his De Corpore politico, where I left, and show
what manner of right the law of Nature gives a man; and whether there be such a
large Charter as he expresses, or no.

CHAP. XXIV.
Of the law and right of nature. Man's subjection to God, and dominion over the
Creatures; The rules of his actions. Man exempted out of Adam's charter; why.
Noah's Patent; And his Sons p^ss^ssing themselves of the world. The titles of
propriety discussd. Jus and Vtile, etc.

Sect. 1.
TO understand which, let us conceive, that the law of Nature belonging to
every thing is that law which was given it at the Creation; and the right of
nature, What is the law, what the Right of Nature.
or jus Natural, must be that authority or title is granted by that law to use
or do any thing; which title can be nothing but that jus or right which God
gave him, Genesis 1.28, 29. Which we find to extend to the Earth, the Foul, the
fishes, Man in his most peculiar dominion* subject and tributary to God.
the living things that move upon the earth, the herbs and trees; This is his
Jus Natural, but yet this is not to be used as he will, although he be Lord of
them, there are laws for Lords as well as servants, Kings as well as subjects;
and they must be subject to the King of heaven, as their subjects to them; yea,
in these things which they are made Lords over; We may see in the 4. of
Genesis, that Cain and Abel brought Oblations to GOD of those things over which
they had a most peculiar dominion; they paid God, as it were, a tribute out of
those things he gave them a right to by that law of nature which he gave them
at their creation; from whence it appeare's that man has not such right to any
thing, much less to all things, to do what he pleases with or to them, for
then they had had no right to have neglected that duty of Oblation, and then
they could have done nothing by which God should have put a difference betwixt
Cain and his Oblation; and Abel and his Oblation, as he did:

Sect. 2.
Man in his first Charter had dominion given him over the creatures, but not
over other men.
Then secondly, let us consider that here is not in this Charter expressed any
right a man has over other men, but this right is equally granted to Man over
those creatures there specified, but none to any man over another; Therefore
all right that any man has to do any thing to another must either be by
nature, as Parents, in regard of whose origination of their Children's lives
and educa^^^^ of them, they have naturally a right to govern and (...) any
things concerning them; or else it must be by (...) Covenant, concession or
yielding, expressed or (...) of one to the other; but in the original Charter
(...) is not any grant or privilege given to one over (...); and therefore
barbarous acts of inhumanity, (...) it is to be supposed that no man would
yield (...) should act upon him, no man can have right to (...); Upon these
Considerations his proposition must (...) perish, when he says, every man has
right to any (...); but he seems to prove it thus. [ For seeing all (...) he
wills must therefore be good to him, in his own ^^dgement, because he
wills them, and may tend to his pre^^^vation some way or other, or he may
judge so, and we have ^ade him judge thereof, Sect. 8. If he had said, I have
^ade him judge thereof, the force of the Argument would quickly have been
shat^ered, because his authority is weak to constitute a Judge in so weighty
affairs; but when he said we, I wonder who he means. I am sure I was none of
them, nor do I remember to have read any other, but himself, of that mind,
That every man must be judge of his own Cause: I know every man will judge and
act according to his judgment, who is an honest and virtuous man; but to be a
Judge Authoritative, which that phrase ( we have made him judge thereof) does
imply, Man's will not to b^ the rule of his judgment, nor the reason of his
actions.
is that which no man says but himself; how he is a Judge, I have showed
before, by what right to judge, by the law of Nature, not by his making him;
his will has not right with it to act any thing because he wills it, but
because it is regulated by the laws of nature, and acts according to those
rules, therefore only he has right to do what he does by them; and therefore
his Conclusion, which (he says) fallows out of his premises, is vain, which
is, that all things may be rightly done by him.

Sect. 3.
He goe's on with another, [ for says he, for this cause it is rightly said,
Natura dedit omnia omnibus, Why men a^e exempt from Gods general charter of
dom^nion at man^ creation^
that nature has given all things to all men] the truth of this must next be
examined. Nature may be said to have given all things to all men, those things
before expressed in Gods charter at man's Creation; but nature has not given
men right over one another, which is mainly importuned by him in both these
Treatises, and must be understood in the latitude of that universal term all
things; for unless other men, all things cannot be given to him; now that other
men are not given to each other will appear out of this, that then God should
not be offended with those acts which were done one to another where is no
positive law; To put a restraint on any v^ce which had no positive law against
it.
for where there is no positive law of God's, or man's prohibiting them, only
the law of nature is of force to restrain men's actions, and to give right to
every thing; and, without doubt God can be displeased with nothing that is
right; well then, let us cast our eyes upon the 19. Chap. of Genesis; we shall
find there the Sodomites attempting a most wicked and unjust act upon two
strangers wayfaring men, As the sin of Sodom^, it may be reasonably supposed,
had none.
as they thought, because the assault was so universal by the old and young, of
the City, it is reasonable to think, there was no positive law against that
sin, for men universally would not confront a positive law; and again, if
there had been any positive law, it is probable, Lot would have urged it to
them; but there being none, and these men by the height of their lust (which is
one of Mr. Hobbes his titles) having smothered the light of nature, pursued the
design, and had the wrath of God falling on them by Fire; why was God so angry?
Mr. Hobbes would have told him, there is no positive law forbidding it, and
thou have given all things to all men by Nature, and it is lawful for any man
to do any thing to any man. Let us ascend higher, and consider, in the 4. of
Genesis, that Cain kills Abel; in the 9 verse. God questions Cain about him,
Where is thy brother Abel? His answer was somewhat like Mr. Hobbes's, I know
not, am I my brothers keeper? and yet this was but like him, it was very short
of Mr. Hobbes's his impiety; he only pleaded that he was not accomptable for
him, he was not to be charged with his condition, be it what it will; Mr.
Hobbes he would have told God, thou have given him to me, and I had right to
do what I would with him, by thy Commission; this villain wan thy favor from
me, and now I have taken him away by that natural right which thou have given
me; Mr. Hobbes he would have out-Cained Cain himself, How Mr Hobbes would have
out-Cained Cain in the justification of fratricide.
in his justification of these horrid acts, by his Principles; but because God,
whose anger is never but most just, did express himself so severely against
him, and could not be just, unless these Sodomites and Cain had transgressed
some Law (which could be none but the law of Nature) it must needs show that
these men had no right to do what they would with any thing, that is, with
other persons; but had their right confined in many acts by the law of nature*
again, The contradiction in mutual domi^ion, every man over every man.
if every man had right over every other person, then those men have mutually
right over one an^^her, and the same persons, in the same cause, in respect of
the same persons, should be both superiors and infe^^ours, which is a
contradiction, and impossible to be. I let this pass therefore without further
trouble, and come to examine how Nature has given all those other things, the
Earth, the Fowls, the beasts, to all men.

Sect. 4.
To understand this we must have recourse to the Charter before mentioned in
the first of Genesis, No new Patent made to Noah but thae to Adam re-enforced.
as likewise Psalm. 115.16. The earth has he given to the Children of men,
which gift was made by the law of nature at the first Creation, for else we
find no other Grant, unless some men may think it a new Patent which was made
to Noah and his sons, Genesis 9. Which yet upon examination will appear no other
but a renewing of the former Charter, which being given to man in his
integrity, he might justly suspect to be lost by his sin; God therefore, in
this replanting the world, repeats the former privileges, almost word for
word, after the Flood; and therefore if it were a gift of God by nature at the
first, or with nature in the Creation, it is now either a positive law, or else
a renewing of the former Charter. Let us now examine it, and begin with Noah,
for wh^tsoever the other Charter to Adam was, if it differ from that to Noah,
as sure it does not, in any material thing, yet it would advance the knowledge
of this truth but little, because all that was passed was so washed with the
flood, as there was utterly a new beginning; now we may observe then in the 9.
Chap. of Genesis verse. 1. That God blessed Noah and his sons, and gave the
possession of all sublunary things to them indifferently; for although there
was a principality in Noah, without doubt, over his Sons; yet it seems by that
term ( ye) in the plural number, that a right to all these Creatures was
granted to them all, and by that universal phrase over every beast, etc. I^
seems that every one had a right to all these, though Noah had his paternall
dominion over his sons only; Noah's sons like coheires or entercommoners
in their right.
and this general right is described by some Casuists to be like that of
Coheires to the same inheritance when their father is dead, each of which has
his right to the whole until they come to a partition; and this is called Non
plenum dominium; they have a right to the whole, but not a full right; there is
no grass upon that inheritance which you can say any of these Coheirs have not
a right unto until the partition, yet no one has a full dominion of the
whole, they cannot sell, or alien the whole. Or, methinkes, it was like
entercommoners in the same pasture; every entercommoner has right to the whole
Common, and his Cattle has right to feed in any place, and eat what they
will, and can get, and so has every man's Cattle that entercommunes with him,
they have all the same right; yet that which any man's Cattle has seized on, is
proper only to those Cattle, and when he has mouthed any grass, it is an
injustice in another entercommoner to take that away out of his mouth, which
his Cattle had seized upon; So was it with those sons of Noah, they were
entercommoners of the world, they might, de jure, any one, seize upon any
thing, any part of it, and being seized of it, it was then his, and he had a
propriety in that which before he was only a Commoner of; this was the donation
of God, and they were all put out into their Common; and you shall find, not
long after, how they took their shares and several possessions, and from
thence forward it was unlawful to dispossess any of what they were seized.
For my part I cannot believe, as some men, that are over-wise, do think, that
the world was divided by consent amongst such a handful of men, none of all
which, I can guess, knew half the world; but, as I expressed before, They had
not the world divided among them by consent, but by casual occupancy, or
choice, as every of them thought fit.
being entercommoners thrust into the same Common, as they found places fit for
them, and not possessed of others, they entered upon them, and enjoyed them, and
those places they enjoyed in common before; and every one had a title to them
before that entrance; but afterward the possessed enjoyed by their private
title; and it were injustice to defraud them of those possessions.

Sect. 5.
I know it may be objected, Obj. Ans.
how that the Children of Israel dispossessed the Canaanites; and it is clearly
answered, that God, who gave men their titles, The Children of Israel
dispossessed the Canaanites by Gods prerogative which he had received
never gave them so absolutely, no not in any Commission by the law of Nature
its self, but he reserved a prerogarive to dispose of any thing otherwise, when
it should please him; and that God, by that prerogative, did give to the
Children of Israel their title to that land, to the Egyptians goods, to many
other things; which gift of Gods if any man can show to any thing which is
another, it cease to be that others, and becomes his; for the earth is the
Lords, he is the absolute Proprietor, our propriety is but usu-fructuary, and
that dum Domino placuerit; yet until his will is revealed to dispose otherwise
of it, it is injustice to take any man's estate from him. For these proprieties,
although no man can show an universal peremptory command of Gods, that thus or
thus these or those worldly goods shall be appropriated to th^se or those men,
yet men in the very first plantation of the world did apprehend God that
granted this power of ^ppropriating some parts peculiar to themselves in the
Charter of entercommoning. So it appears, that Noah, The first generation of
men underst^od their titles of prop^iety without Gods peremptory command.
understood it in the 9. Chap of Genesis, presently upon the sin of Cham verse
27. God shall enlarge Iaephet, and he shall dwell in the Tents of Shem, and
Canaan shall be his servant; which could not be, but that there must be a
propriety in Shem. So that then it seems evident to me, that both the rights
of Common and propriety were passed in the same deed, because as the other was
expressed in the beginning of the Chapter; so this employed or supposed in the
latter end; I think I have said enough of this Conclusion, how Nature gave all
things to all men. If you will have a Law-phrase, they had juc ad rem, not in
re, they had a title to the thing, to any thing, a remote title, every man is
capable to have any thing; and if the true Proprietor desert it, it may be his;
but they have only a title in re, which have lawful possession of it, to enjoy
and make use of it: He proceeds.

Sect. 6.
[ So that jus and utile, right and profit, is the same thing.] I am sure such
a right is the greatest wrong in the world; Jus and Utile not the same thing.
to pretend right to what another is rightfully seized of, is most unjust; the
world, until it was possessed, and each piece of it, was indifferent to any
man, and so is still; but when possessed, it is injustice to deprive the
possessor of what he enjoye's. He again [ But that right of all, as to all
things, is in effect no better then if no man had right to any thing] thi^ were
true of his manner of right he delivered, but not of that I have expressed; for
by that right I spoke of, all the first planters of the world had right to what
they planted, and yet at this day, Places etc not (...) that first s^iseth.
when any land is found inhabited only by beasts, whether such as was never
before discovered, or deserted by the former inhabiters, it becomes the right
of him that enters upon it; so likewise all such Fowl^, Be^sts, fishes,
precious stones, which by no Civil law of particular Nations are appropriated,
are his who seiseth first upon them; and it is an injustice, by force, or
fraud, to deprive them of what they have so seized.

I remember Tullie has an excellent discourse, How Tul^ie underst^o^ Utile far
oth^^wise then M^ Hobbes.
in one Paradox, to show, That Honestum and utile is the same; but then in that
he takes Utile not, as Mr. Hobbes, for gain, or what conduces to the saving
this life; these things he utterly contemnes, and shewe's they are not
profitable, but unprofitable, or many times hurtful to man; but he understands
this word profitable for that which conduces to man's happiness; and ^his he
affi^ms to be only such things as are honest, I think no man ever justified his
Conclusion, as he understands these terms of profit and right.

He ends this Sect. with an endeavor to prove his Conclusion [ For says he,
Mr. Hobbes's A^gument ex non concessis.
there is little use and ben^fit of that right a man has, when another, as
strong or st^engt^ then himself has right to the same.] This Argument would
have some force if his foundation had been well laid, which was, that every man
had right to every thing even in another possession; but that appears to be a
mistake in him, and therefore this Argument is weak which is drawn ex non
concessis.

CHAP. XXV.
Concerning nature's right, liberty, power; Of war and self-preservation by
it. For what ends and advantages a man may renounce his right to life liberty,
etc.

Sect. 1.
THus having finished my discourse upon this subject, as much as concerns his
Corpus Politicum, I return to examine his handling the same in his Leviathan,
to see if the diversity of expression in this from the other does add any
thing to the confirmation of his design, Cap. 14. page 64. He defines the
right of nature to be, the liberty every man has to use his own power, as he
will himself, for the preservation of his own nature.

The right of nature not such as Mr. Hobbs defines it.
This definition I except against, as not cut out even to the thing defined.
First, it is too narrow, for this right of nature concerns not himself alone,
but a man by right of nature has right to many things which relate not to his
own life: Yea, if it have such a liberty which consists in, to do, or, not
to do (as he expound's it presently after) then it is a right of nature, to
forbear to use his own power, for the preservation of his life, as well as to
use it; so that out of this regard his definition agree's not to every
particular contained in the right of nature. Secondly, like an ill made
garment, as it is too straight in one place, so it is too wide in another, the
liberty a man has to use his power, as he will himself, for the preservation
of his own life, is not a right of nature; for the right of nature, as I have
showed, is a result out of the law of Nature, which impower's him for that
action; but the law of nature gives not a man leave to do what he will for the
preservation, etc. (as I have showed before) but only such things as are just,
and according to right reason and the most public and greatest intendments of
Nature, to which every particular man's nature and life is aimed by that Nature
which gives him his nature, are to be preferred before his life.

Sect. 2.
The next thing I blame is his description of Liberty, thus, [ By liberty is
understood, according to the proper signification of the word, the absence of
external impediments.] This is a most improper exposition of that liberty he
immediately before put in the definition of right, Nor liberty, as he
describe's it.
for external impediments have nothing to do with the liberty of right; nor
does the taking away the ability to recover his estate by strength of
opposition, take away the right to have it, especially this natural right; for
other rights, by civil institution, and donation, do in some manner, depend
upon outward things, because those National laws, which give them these
rights, are outward, although right and title be an inward thing, the issue of
that outward law; but in natural right the very law which give's a man this
right is an internal law, a law writ in man's heart; and therefore the liberty
which attend's this right, and which, he says, this right is, can in no sense
be understood to be the absence of external impediments; he adds [ Which
impediments may often take away part of a man's power to do what he would.] This
is weakly said, External impediments may hinder, but not take away natural
power.
or most impertinently, or both; for external impediments can take away no part
of natural power (which alone is necessary to natural right) this may hinder
nature in its operations, but this cannot take away the power of operating; and
in oecconomicks the disobedience of a Son may hinder the acts of a Parents
exercising his jus natural, his natural right over his son but it cannot take
away his natural right over him: These rights are internal things, which are
not much concerned in what is outward but remain and keep their being,
whatsoever outward things happen.

Sect. 3.
His third thing to be censured in this Chap. and Page is his definition of a
Law of nature which is this [ A law of nature (Lex naturalis) is a precept, or
general Rule found out by reason, by which a man is forbidden to do that which
is destructive of his life or takes away the means of preserving the same,
and to omit that by which it may be best preserved. Exceptions against Mr.
Hobbes definition of the law of nature.
] He is a most unhappie man in his definitions, which are foundations upon
which he build's his discourse, yet are so weak as they cannot themselves
withstand the least opposition which many Reasons may assault them with. First
for this, we may observe, that if he had said, such a Precept, as he se^s down,
had been a law of nature, or a conclusion deduced out of a law of nature, he
had spoke truth; but saying, a law of Nature is such a precept, he makes this
precepe to be the Predicate, as we University-men, abused with
University^learning, term it, and then it must be as large as the subject. A
law of nature is what this is not; for, first, he makes this precept to be only
a prohibition, To a negative law. A precept (says he) by which a man is
forbidden etc. when certainly, although there are negative precepts; yet they
are founded upon affirmative precepts; no negative which is not supported by an
affirmative, and this law forbidding, must be founded upon this affirmative
duty enjoined by the law of nature that a man must love his own life. Certainly
had not Mr. Hobbes proudly contemned University learning, he would have writ
more properly, and have seduced himself into fewer errors; next, A vein of
erours that run through his book.
observe with me that general error which runne's through his whole discourse;
that he makes Nature aiming, in all her intendments, at the benefit only of
particulars in those provident laws which she has made for the universal,
when, indeed, the nature of all laws is to look to the public, and
particulars only as they are parts of the public. The latter part of that
Section I have showed erroneous already, which affirms law and right
inconsistent.

Sect. 4.
His next Sect. in the same page and Chap. begins thus [ And because the
condition of man (as has been declared in the precedent Chap.) is a condition
of war of every one against every one, in which case every one is governed by
his own reason.] He said somewhat like truth, Mr. Hobbes may be allowd to say,
he declares, when he proves nothing.

But not to suppose a multitude of falsehoods to make up the horridness of one
conclusion.


when he said it was declared in the precedent Chapter; for certainly there was
a bare declaration of such a thing, no m^nner of proof that had show of reason.

Posito quolibet, sequitur quidlibet; if men suppose impossible things, they
may from thence-argue impossibilities, Uno absurdo concesso, mill sequuntur,
an error in the foundation, in the first drawing a line, multiplie's its self
all the way, thus in this instance he goes on [ And there is nothing he can
make use of that may not be a help unto him in preserving his life against his
enemies, it follows that in such a condition every man has right to every
thing even to one another bodies,] see how many falsehoods are supposed to make
up this horrid conclusion. First, that unreasonable definition of the right of
Nature. Secondly, that, as bad, of the law of Nature. Thirdly, That not to be
imagined thesis that every man is at war with every man, without all which this
cannot follow, that every man has right to one another bodies; for certainly
that Nature which gave a right in common to the universal world, besides that,
gave every man a propriety in his own body, and none had interest in it but by
jus naturae, as Parents, or by some concession expressed or employed, as in
polities; yea in war (says he) certainly not so, neither; for by the law of
Arms men have not right to butcher one another without there be martial
opposition; there are inhumanities in wars, which men have no right to use,
as perhaps will be showed hereafter; so that then all these Propositions (which
are all app^rently false) must be granted, or else the Conclusion which is
drawn out of these denied premises is void and of no cleerness; yet take his
Conclusion altogether, it has some likeness of truth with it, [ That in such a
Condition every man has right, etc.] In such a condition, which was never
known, which is impossible, in such a condition a man may have such a right;
he proceeds in the same place [ And consequently it is a Precept, A term
wanting to Mr. Hobbes's just engagement in a war.
or general rule of reason, that every man ought to endeavor peace as far as
he has hope of obtaining it: and when he cannot obtain it, that he may seek
and use all helps and advantages of war.] This conclusion might have been
granted without these unjust means of obtaining it, only one term added to
the last clause, which is, when he has used sufficient means to obtain peace
and cannot get it, then he may make use of the advantages of war; for without
this term sufficient a man may attempt a peace, and upon any denial or pause,
at the first, he might with justice engage in a war which were most unjust.

Sect. 5.
That which followe's is against his own Principles, the first branch of which
rule (says he) contains the first and fundamental law of nature (which is to
seek peace, and follow it) this, according to his principles, can be but a
deduction out of the law of nature; for if the law of nature be, as he defined
it, just before in this page, a Precept by which a man is forbidden to do that
which is destructive to his life, And to him a remembrance of his own
principles.
this can be no other but a deduction out of that.

[ The second (says he) is the sum of the right of nature, which is, by all
means we can to defend our selves. War not the only preservative of man's
right or Nature's.
] The second branch is not the sum of this right, etc. but a branch of it;
for there are many other means to preserve our selves besides war, although in
a desperate case war may be one. What followe's in that Chap. concerning the
second law of nature, deduced out of this, that a man should lay down his
right to all things, etc. I think it needless to speak of; for first there is
no man has, The discourse of man's laying down his right to all things, etc.
unnecessary.
by nature, right to any person but his own; secondly, a man need's lay down
his right to nothing; for his right to any thing returns to him, if any thing
lack an owner, which is not disposed of by such powers, which by deduction from
the law of nature, are authorized to sett^e them otherwise; and therefore all
those needless definitions and descriptions of what it is to lay down a right,
what renouncing, what transferring, what obligation, duty, injustice, are;
which are touched in the 65. Page, I let go at present and for altogether,
unless some just occasion hereafter may make me look back upon them; only that
require's a censure, which he deliver's in the bottom of that Page, and the
beginning of the next, which discourse as I conceive it wicked in its self, so
it render's all which he spoke before exceeding malicious.

Sect. 6.
This discourse begin's thus [ Whenever a man transferreth his right, or
renounceth it, it is either in consideration of some right reciprocally
transferred to himself, or for some other good he hops for thereby.] This I
grant so far as the words express it; That is not always really good for
which a man pa^ts with (...) right.
but there is something he implies which will render it fit for censure anon;
his reason likewise I allow, which followe's [ for it is a voluntary act, and
of the voluntary acts of every man the object is some good to himself] as for
his deduct on which is laid therefore there be some rights which no man can be
understood, by any words, or other signs, to have abandoned or transferred]
this in general has some truth; for since the end of man is his happiness,
which he must needs love, happiness and goodness being as proper an object of
the will, as colors to the sight, or any other, yet this applied to any
particular thing will be found erroneous; for although good and happiness must
needs, by the law of nature, be desired; yet because what is that good and
happiness is not so universally apparent, when that good and happiness shall
be instanced in any particular, it will not be universally received; Now I will
consider his examples [ As first (says he) a man cannot lay down the right of
resisting them that assault him by force to take away his life] This is a
mistake in him, a man can, and many men have done it; a man can, for a man can
prefer other things before his life, and therefore can exchange h^s life for
that; men ought to prefer their Countries good before their own, both being
in its self a greater good, and of greater durance; men may prefer their
souls eternal good beyond this life, the hope of which give's the greatest
comfort this life is capable of; A man may lay down his right to resistance,
and preservation of his life for a greater good.
one may and ought to prefer the glory of God before his own life; by which
that eternal good of his own soul shall be assured to him; these men may, and
ought to prefer, who are Christians; and as Reason guide's to these actions,
so Experience of them who have done it, for these ends, shewe's it may be done;
but there are a hundred little by-ends for which men have done it; those of
honor in several kinds, for riches, for present pleasures; and there is
almost no worldly contentment, for which some men have not adventured, and lost
their lives; but it may justly be objected, Obj. Ans.
that those did not virtuously do it. I answer; that is not material to his
proposition, which uses not the word, ought not, but cannot lay down, etc.
yet in the first conditions, before named, which are virtuous, take one eminent
Story, besides a multitude, told by Tertullian in his Apologeticus adversus
Gentes, Cap. 37. the story is thus; Tertullian lived in the time of Severus,
who persecuted the Christians most barbarously: Tertullian, being converted to
Christianity, takes courage, and writes this Book in defense of them, against
that cruel manner of persecuting, which was to destroy them unheard, only upon
confessing Christianity, like Wolves or beasts odious to the Commonwealth;
amongst other slanders, by which this Injustice was colored to the world, this
was one, which they were accused of, that they were ill affected to the
Imperial government, Tertullian's signal instance in the Christians of his
time.
and were enemies to it. Tertullian, in answer to this, says in 37. Cap. If we
were maliciously affected to revenge the injuries done us; Vel una nox pauculis
faculis largitatem ultionis possit operari si malum malo dispungi penes nos
liceret. The meaning of which is, that they were strong enough to set the City
on fire, in one night, when they would. Now says he, if we would declare our
selves enemies, we are strong enough to make it good, the Mauri, or Marcomauri,
or Parthi are not so numerous, they inhabit one Country, we the world; what war
are we not fit for, even with unequal forces, who can suffer our selves tam
libenter trucidari, so willingly to be slain? but, says he, in this
discipline we have learned to be killed, rather then kill; yea, if we would not
fight against you, we could, without rebellion, by a mere desertion, destroy
you, by the loss of so many Citizens, this very divorse would astonish you,
you would lack men whom to govern. Let him that will, read that Chap. and the
rest about it, he shall find the Christians killed, tortured, yea persecuted,
dead, so that the sanctuary of the grave, as he speaks was not a refuge for
them; he shall find that they could easily vindicate themselves from these
evils; yet they chose to suffer them, rather then do the least evil, having
implicitly covenanted with that government, by being born under it, to obey
it; nay this shewe's, that they, and such a world of men, were of this opinion;
and it was apparently known, or else he durst not have published this
discourse to be read by the Emperor, and to dissuade him from his persecution
by such an Argument, which, for matter of fact, might so easily have been
confuted. Had these men been of Mr. Hobbes his mind, they would have said, what
do you talk of Obedience, give us life, in defense of which a man may kill any
man, or men? yea all the world rightfully; nor can any Covenant, by words, or
otherwise, divest us of this right; but they were not of his opinion, and their
practice is enough to confute Mr. Hobbes, that a man can lay down that right,
etc. and it was virtuous so to do.

Sect. 7.
What he farther instances in, concerning Wounds, Chains, and Imprisonment, He
may suffer imprisonment etc. without reluctance for the same reason..
how that the same may be said of them as of a man's life; that no covenant can
pass away a man's right of rescuing himself from them, may seem answered in
what was applied to those of Life; because if we may pass away our right to
our own life, much rather to these lesser things; but I will examine his reason
[ both (says he) because there is no benefit consequent to such patience, as
there is to the patience of suffering another to be Wounded or Imprisoned] no
benefit? Yes surely, great every way, when these afflictions are laid upon us
by lawful Magistrates, Obedience being better then sacrifice.
then there is the benefit of obedience then which no sacrifice is more
grateful to Almighty God; it is that which is the foundation of polity, and
without which no Commonwealth can subsist; for if men should not subject for
Conscience, and think that obedience to punishments a virtuous duty, which
carrie's its reward in its self, no man would ever submit, so long as he could
find any means to struggle; the innumerable instances might be made of this,
might of themselves fill a volumne; take but that one of Marcus Regulus, how he
rather then he would violate a little promise, and that with an Enemy, did
expose and thrust himself unto such vengeance, and tortures, as the greatest
malice could impose upon him; how much rather upon those weighty, though
implicit Covenants, which every man make's with that Commonwealth wherein he
live's, to obey the Laws made for the good of it, how much rather may they
exact a submission to them, though with our own loss and injury?

Sect. 8.
He goes on [ And lastly, the motive and end, for which this renouncing and
transferring of Rights is introduced, is nothing else but the security of a
man's person in his life, and in the means ^f so preserving life as not to be
weary of it.]

I will not discourse over again these terms, renouncing and transferring of
right, the nature of which I have before debated, A man may renounce h^s right
pro ^ris et foci^.
but here only touch upon what the end of men's submission to the laws of
Politic society is, and wherein it consists, which is that he means by th^se
phrases Renouncing, etc. and, surely, to say, it is nothing else but the
security, etc. is much too bold an assertion; for certainly Pro aris and focis,
was wont to be the Argument why men did engage themselves in any dangerous or
hard adventure, and Pro aris first. I may say the same for the good of their
Posterity, For the good of his posterity.
for which we have read the famous story of the Children of Israel, drawing our
that painful and laborious journey through so many hazards and perils, forty
years together, that their Posterity might live contentedly and blessedly in
Canaan; and we daily find multitudes of men amongst us who spend as long time
without any comfort in their own lives. (I speak of these sensual comforts
and eases which he intimate's*) only out of this regard, that they have an
expectation, that their Posterity after them may live plentifully.

Again, as I instanced before, the good of the Commonwealth in which they
live has not only here a sufficient Argument to persuade a hard, but even to
cast off all life for their Countries good; I need not speak of the monastic
retreats, which in God's cause many yea multitudes of men, make, Monastic
retreats.
and no doubt many honestly and piously, in truth and reality, even to be
Anchorites, and renounce all contentment in this world; all which makes it
apparent, that this life, and the contentments of it, are not the sole and
only end for which men renounce their rights and interests; and therefore men
may enter into such Covenants, where even the subjection of their life's, and
all the accommodation of it may justly be engaged, without any misconstruction
or fraud, as he seems to imply immediately after, and therefore that must fall
of it self, and I need speak no more to it. What follows in the same Page;
concerning Contracts, Covenants, etc. I let pass, unless, by misapplication
of them, I find hereafter that they are abused to the prejudice of some cause,
which will deserve vindication, and I will now come to what he speaks of
Merit, at the bottom of page 67. and the beginning of 68.

CHAP. XXVI.
Of merit by contrast and otherwise. The distinction ex congruo and condigno
expounded according to the schools.

Sect. 1.
HE that performs first (says the Author) in the case of Contract, is said
to merit that which he is to receive by the performance of the other, and he
has it as due.] This is true which he writes, this is Merit, but this
expression comprehend's not all merit, this is a legal merit; a man in this
case may implead the party he conracted with, and gain his reward by right of
law; but there may be merit without a legal title, as thus; A soldier takes a
Prisoner, uses him civilly, dismisseth him, afterward that soldier,
Diversity of Merit.
who was so treated, takes his taker prisoner, he, without question, deserved
to be civilly used again by him; Titius finds Sempronius a poor necessitou^
Child, takes him into his house, breeds him up carefully; without question
Titius deserves from Sempronius all dutiful observances, but he cannot implead
him for it, but in humanity it is due to both these from whom they have
received these obliging kindnesses, although there was no Contract preceding.
The Catchers title so sca^terd money.
What he adds presently after, of a man who scatter's money, to be his who
catches it, is no differing case from the other, for it is by way of Contract,
and the title to that money is as legal in him who first snatcheth up the
money, as in him who should get that money by any other Contract. In the bottom
of that page he adds [ But there is between those two sorts of merit this
difference, that in Contract I merit by virtue of mine own power and the
Contractors need but in this case of free gift (so he call's that scattering
of Money) I am enabled to merit only by the benignity of the giver.]

Sect. 2.
This distinction I conceive manifestly weak; for first, what he says of that
he call's Contract is as true of the other, that in contract I merit by virtue
of my power and the Contractors need; so is it in that contract, as I call it,
where money is scattered for him who can first catch it; he who catches it
first has it by his own power of catching, and the Contractors need of that
pleasure to see men, scramble for the Money; and he deserves it, as well as a
Musician does his hire, or any other of these men which are contracted with for
any of our pleasures or recreations So likewise in the second part of his
distinction what he ^ffi^mes of this other, which he calls Free gift may as
truly be spoken of the first which he calls Contract, thus [ but in this of Free
gift I am enabled to merit only by the benignity of the giver.] What is it,
Benignity to a Musician varieth not the, nature of this or that Donors contract.
I would ask, that enables ^ Musician to merit that angel, or what else the
liberal Gentleman gives him for his houre's delight he had from him, but the
benignity of the donor; if he play a day together to a man who has a clunched
hand or no affection to the music (as it often happen's) they spend their time
in vain at an unwelcome window, they then merit no more then such boys that
should catch up loose Moneys without the right owners disposing of it to them
by some Contract preceding; but that which he speake's of the benignity of the
giver, that, that enabled the receiver to merit; that has nothing to do in
the varying the nature of a contract; for in Contracts not the affection of the
Contractor, which is not possible to be t^uly known, but the words or signs by
which the Contract is made, are able to make a difference in it, for else
contracts might be differenced according to all humane affections or vices,
hopeful, fearful, voluptuous, covetous, ambitious, etc. but these do not
vary the natures of Contracts, no more then should the benignity of the donor.

Sect. 3.
But he proceeds with another difference [ In Contracts (says he) I merit at
the Contractors hand that he should depart with his right; in this case of
gift I merit not that the giver should part with his right, but that then when
he has pasted with it, it should be mine. How the owner keeps his ptoderty,
who intended to renounce it.
] Here is a show of something, but indeed it is exceeding vain and empty; for
if that money be cast about for such as take it by scrambling, or the like, if
no body come to scramble, the right owner keeps his property, and does not
out himself of that property until a scrambler come and get it; I have seen
money taken up again, so the case is evident. A piece of Plate is provided as
the reward of him who has the swiftest horse to run, at such a time, or such
a place; if any horses come and run, the swiftest horse gets the Plate; but
if there come none, the Plate is where it was, and the other part of runners
being not performed, neither does the contractor lose his first interest; but
if it shall happen that the right owner throw away his interest, and forsake
it, without a Condition of any other side, those goods taken up will be like a
thing found, and perhaps fall into the hand of the Lord, not the taker; all
thi^ shows, that, in these instances of his, the giver does not depart with
his Right, until the Condition of his gift be performed, and by the
performance of that condition a man merits his deserting his right.

Sect. 4.
4. But at the last, in the beginning of Page 68. he undertakes to expound by
this (which he has delivered) a School distinction, thus; [ This is the
meaning of that Distinction of the schools between Meritum congrui and Meritum
condigni; for, God Almighty having promised Paradise to those men (hood winkt
with carnal desires) that can walk through the world according to the Precepts
and limits prescribed by him, they say, he that shall so walk shall merit
Paradise ex Congruo; but because no man can demand a right to it by his own
righteousness or any other power within himself but by the grace of God only,
The distinction ex congruo and ex condigno misund^^stood by Mr. Hobbes.
they say no man merits Paradise ex Condigno] thus far he.

I cannot blame this Gentleman to be offended with the Schoolmen, since it
seeme's to be a learning strange to him, and in appearance is the fate of it, as
well as other Learning, to be scorned by them who understands it not, which
this gentleman does not, or else he maliciously write's, and offer's to expound
this easy distinction. First, the Conclusion (as he expresses it,) is no
where delivered in the Schools; for with one consent, unless some passages in
Gregorius Ariminensis, and Durand, expounded otherwise, The Schools, both old
and later agree to deliver, that Heaven or Glory (which he calls Paradise) is
merited ex Condigno; because that righteous men, acting such things by the
assistance of God's grace, in the mystical union with Christ their head, to
which God has promised heaven, heaven is due to them, as a reward of such
actions, not for their owne' excellency in an Arithmeticall proportion, as
some; How otherwise expounded by the Schools.
but a Geometrieal; or as others, by their Arithmetical proportion taken
vertually, as a seed is vertually a Tree, and has abilities vertually, as a
tree has actually; so these gracious acts have glory vertually in them, as
being the seed of glory; and then, although God can be no debtor to any man's
Merits; yet, he having put such a prise upon them in his Gospel, these have
such a blessing due to them, not out of Congruity only, but Condignity, at
which rate God does value them, by his standard; but then as they say; Heaven
is merited by the righteous ex Condigno, so they say that these Graces, which
enable a man to merit heaven ex Condigno, by Gods Covenant those graces are
merited, ex Congruo, by that man before he is justified or righteous; so that
then to understand the distinction better, lest a Reader should be misguided by
him who is no way acquainted with School Divinity, know that Merit ex Condigno
necessarily requires a Covenant but ex Congruo none. The first can never fail,
because founded upon justice and title; the other may, because built only upon
Grace, as thus; a man promises that he who fights this day well shall be made
a Captain; or a King promises that he who plead's such a cause ably shall be
made a Judge; these places are due to him who does it; there is another, who by
industry in the Law has greater abilities then he, and has pleaded a hundred
causes better; another man who has fought in twenty battles better, yet not
being employed in these services to which the promise was made, they deserve
those places ex Congruo, but the other ex Condigno; the one is truly, and as
truly merit as the other, but he deserves it not legally out of a law or
Covenant, but his own virtue, and the gallantry of his Commander in chief who
rewards virtue; or thus, he who meeting a poor man in necessity shall bargain
with him to pay him doubly for those Clothes he supplies him with when he comes
to a better fortune, which he then adventures upon: when he does come to such a
Condition the other merits that ex Condigno, he must and ought to have it paid,
it is his due; the who seeing that or such another in that sad case should,
without any compact, supply him, when he came to a happier estate, ex Congruo
merits a return from him; although he cannot claim any thing upon debt or
due, yet out of Congruity it is fit he should be satisfied. I do not here
justify the distinction in its application by the Schoolmen, but only set
down my observation of his unjust dealing with them, and how unlike their
meaning is to his; for the Prise he speaks of, which is proposed to him who
wins it out of Covenant, that man who gains it has it out of right of
Condignity, not out of the equality his work has to the reward in its self
intrinsecally, but out of that extrinsecall value which is added to it by the
owners Covenant; and therefore what he adds may have some truth, that [ Because
writers are not agreed upon the signification of the terms of Art, he will
determine nothing in it.] I believe all circumstances will hardly be agreed
upon; yet thus much as I have delivered, which is contrary to what he writes,
is universally consented unto by them; and there is none of them but says,
that what God has Covenanted for, is merited ex Condigno by them who act their
part.

Sect. 1.
CAp. 15. Page 71. In the beginning of this Chap. will appear the unhappiness
of his former discourse, concerning men's natural right, over one another, Mr.
Hobbes's vain supposition of transferring right, etc.
here, in his first words, he supposes [That law of nature by which men are
obliged to transfer their right one to another] The vanity of which I have
discussed before; from this he draws a third [ That men must keep their
Covenants made one to another.] The conclusion is good, His justiying most
horrid sins, where no Covenant had been made against them.
and of the highest consequence, in all commerce betwixt men that possibly can
be; but his Commendation of it is not so commendable as his conclusion, but
most dangerous; his words are these [ And in this Law of nature consists the
fountain and original of justice] This Law is of keeping of Covenants. Let the
Reader look back upon Cap. 14. Sect. 4. and he shall find the wicked Sins of
the Sodomites, of Cain, in which no man can say, that there was any Covenant
betwixt those parties preceded, concerning such actions; and then, upon that
score, they were just, because not unjust; now if the fountain of Justice were
Covenant, then those actions (being where was no Covenant preceding) could not
be unjust. His reason, by which he confirm's this, His reason frustrate.
is not so solid asmight be expected from such a learned man, which is this; [
for where no Covenant has preceded, there has no right been transferred; and
every man has right to every thing; and, consequently, no action can be
unjust.] See here, Reader, how necessary it is timely to stop an Error; it is
a Sickness in a man's soul, and ought to be nipt in its growth; it is an ill
Guest, which is easier kep't out, then thrust out, especially when it come's
with force of a Law, or Axiom, as this did. Had he proved before, that every
man has right to every thing, even in the possession of another's person, yea
to another's person, as he pretended to do, then this Conclusion would have
justly been deduced thence: but I think, that being confuted, this Conclusion
must likewise fall with it. An instance of two persons meeting in some place
not before inhabited.
Let us consider two or more men of diverse nations met together in some, before
not inhabited, place; were it not unjust, against the law of nature, that one
should murder, or maime the other, without any injury from him? were it not
just, that they should help one another in distress, by the Law of humanity?
If he say, not, consider his own saying (for a man so learned, as he is,
cannot but, in many things, acknowledge the universal rules which govern the
world, although he may misapply them) see therefore page 65. Cap. 14. This
(says he) is that law of the Gospel; Whatsoever ye require that others should
do to you, that do you to them: and that law of all men; Quod tibi fieri non
vis, alteri ne f^ceris] apply this law to these men, without any Covenant,
expressed, or implied, but only that; would any of these think it just, that
the other should do him violence or Injury? It is unjust then by this law,
that he should do it to the other.

His imperfect definition of injustice.
He again labor's to confirm his Conclusion from the definition of injustice,
which, says he, is [ The not performance of Covenant] this definition was
never (I think) writ before; although a thousand have treated of injustice, yet
never any defined it so; It is true, every breach of Covenant is Injustice: but
Injustice is what is not a breach of Covenant, as I have showed, and therefore
will insist no further upon it.

Sect. 2.
He goe's on [ But because Covenants of mutual trust where there is a fear on
either part (as has been said in the former chap.) are invalid] The place he
mentioned is page 68* where he deliver's that [ If a Covenant be made wherein
neither of the p^^^les perform presently, but trust one another; in the
condition of mere nature (which is a condition of war of every man against
every man) upon any reasonable suspicion it is void. but if there be a common
power set over them both, with right and force sufficient to compel
performance, Suspicion makes not Covenants void.
it is not void.]

This proposition, although it make a fair show, upon a superficial view; yet
we shall find it, upon diligent examination, to be full of unhappy errors. Had
he said, such Covenants are dangerous to be kept: and that men with wicked
principles will not keep them, he had said somewhat that might have borne him
out in it; but to say, they are void, is to affirm, they have no obliging
nature, or Tie with them, which is not to be endured by Justice.

I will first put him the Case betwixt two neighboring nations; they enter
Leagues of Confederacy; The case put between two nations entering League of
Confederacy.
they covenant upon Articles; these two are just like such particular men,
unbodied in a commonwealth: can any man think, that when any of these are
afraid of the other's breach of Articles, it shall therefore be fit for him to
break? can his fear dissolve his Covenant? yes, perhaps, as in his 14. Chap.
to which this related [ If this suspicion be reasonable] A suspicion, though
reasonable, is but a suspicion; and it is possible for any man to find reasons
for suspicions; by this all bargains, and Contracts of nations one with another
will be made nothing; The evil consequences of his opinion.
for no doubt but all nations may, and will suspect one another, and yet dare
not break their promises and Covenants which they make; If this doctrine of
his were received, it would make all Commerce betwixt nations void, yea, I will
tell him, betwixt men in private, so that those sacred Sponsalia betwixt man
and woman were void, if no Witnesses to them; all those promises, yea Oaths
(for they are but a stronger bond of the same Covenant) should be void, if no
Witnesses to testify the Covenant; If men's Covenants cannot bind them, before
they make a Leviathan, why should that Covenant bind them? for the Covenant
concerning their superior must be before he is who is an effect of it. Plato's
ingenious Fable.
Plato in his Protagoras tell's a most ingenious fable, the result of which is
this, that the world being uninhabited, Jupiter appointed Epimetheus to make
all sorts of beasts; but Prometheus he appointed to make men, and endued them
with Wisdom; these men built Cities; fenced themselves from beasts, but by
their wisdom were more wicked then beasts, and injured one another most
impiously; upon that he sent Mercury amongst them; who brought the men two
Sisters, Justice and Modesty, which regulated them in all virtue, and Civility
one toward another; These are universally given to men, and are with them,
where evil principles, and wicked customs, h^ve not extirpated them; So that
that which the School, from the Philosophers, call's Synder^sis, dictate^s to
men those great Axioms of practice: do to others as ye would be done unto;
and keep your faith, and promise, with the like: and no man does violate these,
but with an Injury to the rest and quiet of his mind. I could tell stories of
moral men, innumerable, who would keep Covenant, even with their ruin, and
death; but they are obvious: It is apparent, that although men may, and do
break Covenants; yet they are not void; they have a Tie upon man in his
Conscience* which makes them afraid to offend in Scandalous and great Injuries.

Sect. 3.
He proceed's, [ Though the original of Justice be the making of Covenants; yet
injustice there can be none, till the cause of such fear be taken away, which,
while men are in the condition of war, cannot be done.] Thus far he: This
phrase, such fear, must be understood of that fear a man has of another's
violation of Covenant; I think all this is satisfied: that there may be
injustice before Covenant; injustice against the practicke law of nature;
injustice after Covenant, in the violation of it; and although he imagine's
fear to secure a man from violating Covenant, it must certainly be such as the
Casuists speak of, metus cadens, The Casuists metus ^adens.
such as would shake a valiant or constant man, as some certain argument of
Death, or ruin, not suspicion's, that another will not keep his Covenant which
must excuse. Again, I have already showed, that men are not naturally in a
condition of war; so that he build's upon very false foundations. I will not
trouble the Reader with nine or ten lines together, which are nothing but
repetitions of formerly refuted conclusions: but in the next page 72. near the
beginning, he bring's something like a new Argument, from the usual definition
of justice among the Schoolmen, thus:

Sect. 4.
And this is also to be gathered out of the ordinary definition of Justice in
the Schools; for they say, that Justice is the constant rule of giving to
every man his own: And therefore where there is no own, that is, no propriety,
there is no Injustice, and where there is no coercive Power erected, that is,
where there is no Commonwealth, there is no propriety, all men having Right to
all things: Therefore where there is no Commonwealth, there nothing is unjust.]
I am glad to find him speaking something in the Schools, although not fully
approving it: the definition shall pass without any further trouble; although
I think it not perfect yet it will prove much better then any thing he has
produced. Let us examine his inference, which is drawn into some Syllogistical
form, and therefore will abide a juster answer.

His Major is undeniable; where is no propriety, A propriety, where is no
Coercive Power.
there is no injustice; but his minor is mightily to blame, unproved any where,
which is, where is no coercive Power erected, that is, no Commonwealth, there
is no propriety; This Proposition I have showed often to be erroneous; men have
right to their own persons, their Wives, their possessions, without this Power
coercive of a Commonwealth; and therefore this Conclusion is not rightly
deduced out of the premises.

But now, good Reader, pause with me a while, and consider with me, The
foundations wherein Mr. Hobbes builds a Common wealth and the justice of it.
how contrary these me^nes will work to his intention's; he int^^ds to build ^
Common wealth, and the justice of i^, upon ^hese foundations. That there can be
no justice or injus^^^e until then* no not in Covenants which ^^l^ven* and
(...) Justice a being; then is the terror of the coercive power (...); if it
were true, I am persuaded, there were no suc^ (...) as Justice or injustice,
for then there would not be [ a constant rule] or, which is a b^tter word, a
habit of virtue of giving every one his own; but ^ fear of the Magistrate, if
he do not; and the Supr^^e Magistrate, who principally has both the sword and
purse of Justice (reward and punishment) in his power, could not do justice or
injustice, because he has no coercive power above him; and he make's no
Covenant (as he discourses) and I mean to con^ute hereafter: but further,
whatsoever wickedness, oppression, murder, man can do secretly, secure from
the eye and sword of men, had no injustice in it; for if the coercive power of
the civil Magistrate, operating upon the fear of men, be that which gives the
name of justice (as he affirme's) then, without it, no action deserve's that
name. What fallows immediately, is but a repetition of what went before.

In the margent of the same page is written, Justice not contrary to Reason,]
what he write's of this head must be next examined.

Sect. 5.
He begin's thus [ The fool has said in his heart there is no such thing as
Justice; and sometimes also with his tongue seriously alleging that every man's
conservation and contentment being committed to his care, there could be no
reason why every man might not do what he thought conduced thereunto; and
therefore also to make, or not make, keep, or not keep, Covenants, was not
against Reason, when it conduced to ones benefit] Thus he make's the fool to
confirm his wicked Conclusion; and, for my part, The Foole's argument
unanswerable out of Mr. Hobbes's principles.
I think the fools' argument is unanswerable, out of Mr. Hobbes his
principles: for if it be true, as he has supposed, that every man has a
natural right to every thing, and every man's conservation and contentment is
committed to his own charge; and that no man can renounce by any Covenant his
right to defend himself from death, wounds, imprisonment, which he delivered in
his 66 page (and, without doubt, much more may be said for other contentments,
then for some of these) then he can by no Covenant be obliged to forsake any
thing, but only such little things as are scarcely considerable in justice.

He goes on [ He does not therein deny that there be Covenants; and that they
are sometimes broken, sometimes kept* and that such breach of them may be
called Injustice, and the observance of them; His doctrine more honest then Mr.
Hobbes
Iustice] In this the fool's doctrine, if he understand Covenants of such as
are made before there is incorporation in a Commonwealth, is more honest than
Mr. Hobbes's: for Mr. Hobbes deliver's, that such Covenants are invalid,
because there must be a fear of breach on the other side, and so the Covenant
is dull, and a man cannot commit injustice in the breach of them, which this
fool acknowledges. His next words are [ But he questioneth, whether
Injustice, taking away the fear of God (for the same fool has said in his
heart there is no God) may not sometimes stand with that Reason which dictateth
to every man his own good, and particularly then, when it conduces to such a
benefit, as shall put a man in a condition to neglect not only the dispraise,
and revilings, but also the power of other men] taking away the fear of God)
It a man take from any act, or habit, those circums^^nces which make it evil,
Taking away the fear of God, an unreasonable supposition.
it will be good; but I am persuaded that a fear of God is so rooted in the
hearts of men, that although men may darken the light, and clear sight of it,
with wicked reasoning; although men may hinder the vivacity in the opposition
of it, by customary inhabiting, reigning sins: yet it cannot be so extirpated,
but that it will appear, and break out sometimes into action: and although a
fool, or wicked man may sometimes say so; yet other times he will not believe
his own words, and must often fear he is in the wrong. U^certain whether taugh
or learned of the other the Fool or Mr. Hobbes.
This kind of reasoning either Mr Hobbes taught, or learned from him; for I am
persuaded never man disputed so high Conclusions out of such impossible
supposalls, as he has; such is this, if there were no fear of God. Let us see
the force of the fool's Argument; he seems to affirm, that Injustice, taking
away the fear of God, will stand with that Reason which dictateth to every man
his own good; I am persuaded it is good when Injustice may be committed where
is no Common wealth, when men commit injustice so secretly that no Magistrate
may take notice of it; for if no God, no heaven, or hell, praemium or poena,
for good or ill actions; and then a man's considerations are chiefly about his
own ease, pleasure, and contentment in his bodily and sensitive life; but yet
I must add one restraint to the fool's proposition: Injustice may stand with
that Reason which prescribe's his own good, that is, his pleasure, or
contentment; but not with right Reason, for right Reason preferrs the public
good before the private, which cannot subsist without Justice.

Sect. 6.
He goes on with the fools argument most unhappily; he was a witty fool, who
disputed so [ The Kingdom of God is gotten by violence; but what if it could
be gotten by unjust violence? were it against Reason so to get it, when it is
impossible to receive hurt by it? and if it be not against Reason, it is not
against Justice, or else Justice is not to be approved for good] what another
horrid impossible supposall is here brought to confirm the precedent? Mr.
Hobbes's horrid supposal, of getting Heaven by unjust violence.
that heaven should be got by unjust violence; the Kingdom of God, which is
Gods gift only, should be forced out of his hands, by wicked actions, against
his will; but yet there is a different condition in this with the other,
because the Kingdom of God comprehend's in it all happiness which belong's to
any, and without which, at the last departure of his Soul, a man must be
miserable; and therefore it is that the Philosophers call that summum bonum,
which, when revealed, men cannot choose but desire: and therefore if a man
could either by fraud, or force, get it, God, who has so framed a man's
desires, that there is a necessity for him to desire it, could never be
offended at such endeavors; nor can it be unjust for men so to do.

Sect. 7.
He proceed's, [ From such reasoning as this, Successeful wickedn^ss has
obtained the name of vertue]. He pretends to confute the Fool.
Here begin's to confute that conclusion of the fool; that there is no such
thing as Justice: this sentence is his foundation, and he thus argue's; If
there be no injustice, but all men are to do what is most reasonable, that is,
most conducing to their own good, that is, worldly pleasure, or profit, then
succesfull wickedness may be called Virtue, which is abominable, and most
odious; for certainly virtue is not measured by the event, but the nature of
the act, and the natural tendence of it to that is good.

But by inadvertense fights against himself.
This argument of his, against the fool, is strong, but let us examine it; does
not this, and all he speaks against the fool, fight against himself in the 13.
Chap. of his Leviathan? concerning which I have discoursed before. He deliver's
that [men naturally have a right to all things; and any one may rightly do any
thing to any man for the securing of his life or contentment; and that men are
in a state of war (before they are incorporated into a Commonwealth) with all
the world; that in that state, fraud and force are the Cardinal vertues]; so
then, in this state, any successful wickedness must needs be called Virtue
because a man, in such means (according to his doctrine) act's nothing but
what he has right to do, and therefore was just, and acted according to
reason, and by such means obtain's his end's which are his own preservation
and contentment.

Again, he has delivered Chap. 14. [ that no man can renounce his right of
delivering himself from wounds, and chains, and imprisonment, or indeed of any
such thing as may make his life wearisome to him]; well then: let it be
considered, if a man have naturally right to all those things which may secure
and preserve them; then let his Compacts, or Covenants, be whatsoever, yet they
are invalid, which infringe this right which a man has no power to alien from
himself; then, in order to these, whatsoever a man act's after he has
covenanted* himself into a commonwealth, be it never so wicked, must be
clothed with the specious name of virtue; because according to reason and
right; so that (let him say what he will) this unlucky fool disputed most
unanswerably against his principles, and the main hinges upon which his policy
move's, though nothing against mine.

Sest. 8.
He goe's on [ And some that in all other things have disallowed the violation
of faith, yet have allowed it when it is for the getting of a Kingdom. The
violation of faith not ^llowed, for a Kingdom.
] I do not remember that I have read the violation of faith for the getting a
Kingdom justified by any man but Machiavell, who indeed approve's any means to
bring a man to what he aime's at; but, certainly, no man esteemed for
Christianity, or morality: It is said of Julius Caesar, that he would often
repeat out of Euripides that Sentence, which he rendered, Quod si violandum est
jus, regnandi gratia
Violandum est, aliis rebus pietatem colas.
But let the Reader consider, that it is here with (if) if right be to be
violated; and what Tully saye's of him, that he was captus Imperii
consuetudine, ensnared with the custom or habit of commanding, which in his
infancy he had coveted, and from thence would use that speech, and did practice
it as unluckily as other usurpers; but, sure, every man, who is mastered with
any habit of wicked^^sse the fruition of which he viciously covet's, will say
as much for that, as Caesar for governing; but none, as I know of, has
delivered it for a practique conclusion but only Machiavel; therefore that
word [ some] might have been spared by Mr. Hobbes,

Sect. 9.
Page 73. He comes to make particular answers, which are not satisfactory to
the foole's argument, Mr. Hobbes mistake's the question.
and therefore must be examined; in the second line he state's the question,
certainly, not punctually to the purpose; for whereas the fool's conclusion
was, that there was no such thing as injustice, he says lin. 2. (that [ The
Question is not of promises mutual, where there is no security of performance
on the other side; as when there is no civil power erected over the parties
promising; for such promises are no Covenants.] This is a most hateful
parenthesis, (as I have showed) he goe's on [ but either where one of the
parties has performed already; or where there is a power to make him performe]
so that here is a great restraint to the fool's conclusion, and a limitation of
the fool's argument, which I am persuaded, if he had disputed with Mr. Hobbes,
he would not have allowed, for he was bred up in Mr. Hobbes his principles, and
dispute's shrewdly out of them; but although this be not pertinent to the
fool, yet let the fool grant that this shall be the question as Mr. Hobbes
put's it Whither it be against reason, that is, against the benefit of the
other, to perform, or not] Here the poor fool is abused mightily, for the
fool's conclusion was about justice; Mr. Hobbes put's the question concerning
benefit only: certainly many high Injustices have been beneficial, as he
call's benefit, that is, profitable for this life's advantages; but yet see by
what fraudulent steps he steale's into the change of these Terms: first he
has said, that Justice is not against Reason; Reason is not against the Law,
And changes (...) terms fraudulently h^re and otherwhere.
which looks only at the happiness of this life to that particular man;
therefore justice is whatsoever any man act's for his own good; all which
expressions have been before showed not to be depending one upon the other;
but let us examine his argument [ I say (says he) it is not against reason]
from Justice he went to reason; from reason to benefit; and now from benefit to
reason again, for the manifestation of which he has a long discourse to show,
that the wisdom of actions is not to be measured by the events, but the
for^sight and d^sign (which shall be granted him,) Secondly* in that refuted
imagination of [every man's being at war with every man for want of a common
power to keep them in awe, no man can hope to defend himself by his own power,
strength, and wit etc. Therefore he who declare's he think's it reason to
deceive those that h^lp him, can in reason expect no other means of safety
then what can be had from his own single power] This is the force of what he
there write's: But consider, Reader, with me, that this is not to the purpose;
for the foole's Conclusion was concerning the justice and honesty of a thing;
he only out-wit's the fool, and discourses of cunning, or craft, or worldly
profit of those actions, what is most profitable for the advance of the Agent'^
ease and pleasure: but then consider further, and see if this answer of his
satisfy that doubt; The Question, according to his own framing, is, whether it
be profitable to deceive or not; his answer is drawn from a declaration that
that man should make, that he think's i^ fit to deceive, which no man but a
verier fool then he, who objected it, did ever do; He that means to deceive
will not declare his intent.
there is no power to act any great wickedness, but under the show of Piety,
not by professing to deceive, but by professing not to deceive; oaths,
covenants, protestations, cursings of themselves, are the horrid maskes of
Impiety, which wicked men use to deceive with, the Devil can no way so
efficaciously deceive, as by putting on the shape or likeness of an Angel,
sometimes by putting a false gloss upon the Text, as with Adam; sometimes
urging the Scripture its self, as with our Savior. That child of the Devil's,
who will prosper in this world, must not protest and declare that he will
deceive, but protest against it, and utterly defy it; so excellently the Poet
makes Sinon, in that high fraud of his, Cozen by the denying of Cozenage, nec
si miserum fortuna Sinonem Finxit, vanum etiam mendacemque improba finget^ Mr.
Hobbes, I am confident, well knowe's, that he, who is premonished of his
danger, will avoid it; even birds do avoid the net openly laid before them; so
that certainly this come's not close to Mr. Hobbes his purpose which should
prove, that it were not wisely done according to his wisdom, to deceive, when
he speak's only of such who manifest and declare they will deceive; and it is
a maine fault which runne's throughout his whole book, that he attempt's one
proposition, and, by shuffling and changing the Terms, prove's another.

The Bishops Conclusion.
Now my conclusion is, that all deceit is injustice, all injustice unprofitable,
because against the most sacred Lawmakers, who will avenge it here, or
hereafter, whether men take notice of it, or no; evil and injustice will hunt
the wicked person; only honesty and justice will bring a man peace and
prosperity at the last.

Sect. 10.
Afterward he bring's another Answer, concerning the getting of heaven by
violence, Mr. Hobbes's illogical An^wer.
which is not logical; for although he says truth, that there is but one way
of getting heaven, which is, not breaking, but keeping of Covenant; yet, the
Fool supposing the impossibility that men might get heaven by unjust violence,
he was to answer logically out of the premises, and not to deny the
supposition.

Then he comes to answer that argument which amused me, Another like it
concerning the getting sovereignty by rebellion: for let a man read his manner
of writing and judge whether in that he did not seem to make this an argument
against the fool (as indeed it was) when, says he, from such reasoning as this
succes^ful wickedness is called Virtue: now from the hatefulness of this
Conclusion he overthrow's the fools Conclusion. I allow his answer, but think
he had had more reason to have confirmed the argument then overthrown it,
because, as I have showed, it was a doctrine corroborated by the main
principles of his book; then he raises a new discourse about another opinion [
There be some (says he) that proceed farther, and will not have the Law of
Nature to be those Rules which conduce to the preservation of man's life upon
earth, but to the attaining of an eternal felicity after death.] I am of that
mind, The Law of Nature give's rules for the attaining eternal felicity afrte
death.
that the Law of Nature does give rules for the attaining eternal felicity
after death; for it is a most undoubted rule of the Law of Nature, as to the
general, that bonum est appetibile, so to the particular, that according to the
degrees of goodness, that which is majus bonum, is magis appetibile, and ought
to be more desired then what is minus; and this is so universally delivered by
Nature, that no reasonable man heare's the tearme's, and understand's them, but
he assent's to them; here is a major, one rule delivered concerning eternal
life hereafter; if we can find a Minor corresponding, it will be (I think) one
of the clearest delivered truths that can result out of that habit called by
Philosophers intellectus or habitus principiorum; but here, in these Terms he
puts it, there can be no doubt of it: for if it be an eternal felicity (as he
call's it) and all Christians believe, the very Terms render it clear, that
an Eternal is more to be desired then a Temporary, and therefore more to be
endeavored for. I insist no further upon this at this instant; I come to that
he applye's this to.

Sect. 11.
[ To which (says he) they think the breach of Covenant may conduce, and
consequently to be just and reasonable] I think he never read in any Author
this Conclusion delivered, The breach of Covenant though a wicked one conduces
not to eternal felicity yet such Covenants ought to be broken.
that the breach of Covenant does conduce to eternal felicity; for he put's it
in unlimited Terms: It is true, if any man, or men, make a Covenant to do any
wicked thing, although they bind it by an oath, they are bound, and, in order
to heaven, they ought, to repent of that Covenant, and not keep it; but it is
not the breach of Covenant, as a Covenant, which disposes them to heaven, but
the acting of that holy thing which that wicked Covenant forbid's them to do:
As that enterd into by Thieves.
Suppose a Combination of Thieves should covenant with each other to act
whatsoever such a person, whom they make their supreme, should command; one of
this College should have a sense of that wicked life he live's in, knowing that
it lead's to hell and perdition, can any man think he is not bound to leave
that Society, and disobey whatsoever command is imposed upon him of Robbery or
Murder? Suppose an Adulteress married woman should, by her oath, The other by
an Adulteress.
covenant with her Adulterer to appropriate her body to him, do not you think
she was bound, in order to heaven, to break that wicked Covenant? So is it with
all Covenants to do evil, they ought to violate them; but it is not the
violation of Covenant, but the doing of righteousness, which is acceptably
pleasing to God; but he instance's in his following words:

Sect. 12.
[ Such are they (says he) who think it a work of merit, to kill, or depose,
or rebel against the sovereign power constituted over them by their own
consent] This instance he give's because he hoped that writing against such a
horrid diabolical doctrine would usher in the rest of his wicked opinions
plausibly; Mr Hobbes's subtilty in writing against Rebelion.
I am not intended to defend their opinions who think so; but yet I will say
this for them, that I think they that write for killing of kings, which are the
Papists, and some others, as destructive of civil Society as they, will
pretend that those Sovereignes are not constituted over them by their own
consent: they will say, they never consented to his Coronation; to his
acception; never took the Oath of Allegiance and Supremacy: And I will say,
that if this be all the ground of this sin in rebellion, which cannot be by
his doctrine.
there is no such thing as rebellion by Mr. Hobbes his doctrine; for Mr. Hobbes
(as will be seen hereafter) make's no Sovereign, or Leviathan, but such as is
consented unto by every particular, of which kind there is none in the world:
and therefore, where men have not made such a consent, and are bound by that
Covenant which is not to be seen in the whole world, there can be no sin in
rebellion; but this was only an instance to lead on his future scorn of
religion, being in it is self impertinent

CHAP. XXVIII.
Concerning the extent of natural knowledge; Our hopes of eternal happiness;
and our advantages in the prosecution of it; Whereof; as to its certainty de
futuro, we may be more secure then we can be of any thing, from Tradition and
Reason; How unsatisfied man's Understanding and Will is in all things else but
it and God. Concerning the last Article of our faith.

Sect. 1.
BUt (says he) because there is no natural knowledge of man's estate after
death; much less of the reward that is then to be given to the breach of
Faith] Had he stayed there, Mr. Hobbes unkind to Religion in the disparagement
he puts upon natural knowledge.
although this squint's at mischief, yet this might have been sl^pt over, and
might have been somewhat excused, and a man might have said, that he only
denied a natural knowledge of this reward, not a divine faith; and we
Christians may be content with this, although it is an unkind act to Religion,
to hinder it from any assistance, especially in so high a point as this, which
move's the first foot toward heaven, He that comes to God, must believe that
he is, and that he is a rewarder of them who seek him; So that these two acts
of faith are those which leads a man out of this world toward heaven, to
believe there is a God; and that he is a rewarder of them who seek him; both
which the Author has sl^ighted; Of the first I have spoken: Of the second I
shall now treat. But I say, had he given it only this slurre, I would have
passed it over; but as he denye's the assist^nce of Nature to the knowledge of
future happiness; so be most disgracefully adde's [ but only a belief
ground^d upon ^th^r men's saying, that they know it supernaturally, or that they
know those, that knew them, that knew others, that knew it supernaturally]
Could any thing be spoke more sleightingly, or unworthily, of the hope of
heaven? of all the expectation of Christianity? I curb in my self, who could be
angry in bitter Language, and do think it would be comely to do so; but let
others do it that will, I only mean to discourse soberly against it, in no
passion.

Sect. 2.
First, then, suppose all, he says here were true; What a persuasive the
natural knowledge, or belief we have of eternal happiness, is to withdraw us
from our opinion of temporal felicity.
that our knowledge of heaven were nothing but a belief etc. yet it ought to
persuade more then any motive can be brought to regulate our actions with;
which will appear, first, out of the nature of the happiness compared with
others; next out of the evidence it has from the nature of happiness; for it
is an eternal happin^sse, a spiritual bappin^sse; an eternal happiness,
therefore more to be desired then any temporal felicity whatsoever: the content
that a man has in this life is but for this life, and this life is so
momentary, that there is no man has assurance of one daye's delay in it; and
let him who has lead a life in an affluence of all this world's goods, think
what he is the better for them on his deathbed; what will it profit a man to
gain the whole world, and lose his own Soul? yea all his felicity past add's
but to his misery; he may say, fuimus Troes, etc. but has with it a miserum
fuisse; he cannot choose but sit down by the waters of Babylon, and weep, when
he remembers the Sion of happiness, which he has lost, but cannot now enjoy.
I will not drench my self in this common place of the frailnesse, weakness,
and vanity of this world's pleasure: It is evident, in respect of eternity, it
is as nothing, so that then, upon the proposal of such a question, whether had
you rather enjoy this world's felicity, whilst you live, or eternal happiness
hereafter? the answer must needs be, as if it were proposed, whether had you
rather have the possession of an estate for a day, or an Inheritance for ever?
and as a man would say to that, I care not for this possession a day, it is of
no moment; so must a man's judgment conclude; this life is nothing; it is but
a day, not that certain; I am not made happy by any thing which can be added
to me this day, but for hereafter; and the notion of eternity does so fill the
appetite of man, and has such a convenience with it, as he cannot choose, if
he ponder in his Soul the excellency of it, but desire and embrace it.

Sect. 3.
The transcendent delight here in our hopes of eternal happiness.
Then let a man go further, and see, that those thoughts we have of this
eternal felicity, do not represent it to us as of a bodily felicity only, but
a spiritual, an intellectual felicity, proper for man, such felicity as only
can make man happy, and such as can make man happy alone. Conceive a man with a
troubled Spirit, thoughts perplexed, a wounded conscience, to speak in the
Scripture language, For which we loath worldly pleasures.
bring all the riches of this world's pleasure, meats, drinks, music,
delightful sights; make up a body composed of sensual contentments, he
abhorre's them; they vex him, they rather trouble him, then ease him, or
content him; because the intellectual disturbance, which he has, savour's not
those things of these poor bodily delights; they are as much below the
contentments of his mind, as childish Toys to the contemplations of some grave
and serious Philosopher. Again, fill a Soul with those speculations which, at
this distance from it, he can have of heaven, and let him have to that an
assurance, that he is in the way to it; bring fires, fagots, gridirons,
pincers, what you will, And welcome tortures.
he will have blessed, and charitable, and comfortable thoughts at that time;
so that, with St. Stephen, he can thank them for their tortures, and bless
them, and, like a man that has received a benefit, pray to God to bless his
benefactors; so can such a man be happy, when he has spiritual happiness, in
the midst of all worldly miseries. This therefore must be most desirable,
without which no man is happy, and with which no man miserable; with all
worldly, sensual goods a man may be miserable, who has them; but not so with
those; which fortify a man against all the fiery darts of Satan in this world,
and hereafter give him eternal felicity, without any disturbance. So that then
these worldly goods, and this eternal, admit no comparison to him that
apprehend's the one and the other; that eternal felicity must needs be more
desirable then the other. Men may object, had we such assurance of one as the
other, this were true; Obj.
but we have weak assurance of this, and great of worldly; therefore we let
this go, and content our selves with the other.

Sect. 4.
For answer to this, conceive with me, first, Ans.
that although the assurance of the Testimony which is given to these Divine
happinesses were much short of that is given to the other, yet in prudence men
ought to prosecute it; First because we can be no losers of worldly happiness
by the prosecution of this; there is no action, The worldly advantages in
prosecuting divine happin^sse.
which a man does in order to eternal felicity, which hinder's, but rather
adde's to temporal felicity; the governing and regulating our passions, without
which no man can have any happiness, faith, hope, and charity, with all their
proper operations; that man is happier here in this world who has these
habits, and operates accordingly, then he who has the greatest excess of all
worldly things; but, contrariwise, the luxurious enjoying these temporary
things rob's a man of those eternal joys; these actions, in which is most
safety, being prejudicial to no rational felicity; a man acting by the rules
of prudence ought rather to do, such actions then those which are hazardous of
his safety, though seemingly more evident because they appear of no other
profit then for temporal, for sensual contents, and may hurt the other; but
these will be profitable for eternal, spiritual good, and cannot hurt temporal;
Merchant adventurer.
We find Merchants venturing their estates, their lives to the East Indies, per
tot discrimina rerum, although a Journey full of hazard, rather then piddle at
nearer and more secure trades, because the return of the first is of a higher
value; If men then reasonably take such pains, with so much hazard of life,
for such a little difference of advantage as is betwixt these two, only
because there is a possibility of a better return here; much rather should men
engage in this great adventure for eternity, where upon weaker premises (if
they were so) men must expect such an invaluable gain, and are assured of no
possible loss: but I let this pass. Suppose the evidence of it were none but
such as Mr. Hobbes report's, A belief grounded upon others sayings etc. yet
these other men are such, and these from whom they received it, as may give a
better assurance then we can have of any worldly things.

Sect. 5.
Let us, to this purpose, consider what assurance Mr. Hobbes has of his
worldly felicity, Mr. Hobbes can render himself more s^cure of temporal then he
seems to be (with little satisfaction) of eternal felicity
The felicity he places in the enjoyment of this life, and the accommodations
of it; the security of this is by a Covenant made by every man in a
Commonwealth with every man, to submit themselves to a Leviathan, or supreme
Governor, and make him their representative in all his actions, as will
hereafter more fully be discoursed upon; Now I shall show, and it is evident,
there is no such thing, then no security* But suppose there were, he will allow
his Leviathan to covenant nothing with his subjects, then they have not so much
as a promise for their security, not so much as is here spoken by him
concerning man's felicity: a belief grounded upon other men's sayings, and here
is no manner of promise; but because I labor to advance the security men have
of this unicum nec^ssarium, I will not only compare it with Mr. Hobbes his
security, but all that can be had in any politic Society.

Sect. 6.
What security can any man have for the enjoying his studied worldly
happiness? all the security, The promises, and oaths of men, which he make's
his greatest assurance being very fallible.
he can have is from the promises, or oaths of men, that they will do this, or
that; this is the greatest safety that any man can have; but, alas, how
inconsiderable are promises, yea oaths of men, unless honest men, I would our
experience did not teach us; and who can have more then a weak probable
assurance of another's integrity, unless he have sealed it with his blood?
which cannot be showed in any politic concernment de futuro, that it shall
be, and if any man would do such an act, as to dye for confirmation of it, he
might be reckoned a mad man. But, contrariwise, let us examine the assurance
that we have of this.

Sect. 7.
His scornful scale of knowledge.
[ It is grounded (says he) upon other men's saying that they know it
supernaturally, or that they know those, that knew them, that kn^w others, that
knew it supernaturally.] This is a most scornful speech; but had he set down
what men these were who first said they received it supernaturally, the case
had been clear; they were the Apostles, men of a known and assured integrity,
men that sealed this Truth with their blood, and dyed in and for the
justification of it; this no man would do for that he were not assured of.
This, at their deaths, was a comfort in the midst of a thousand agonies. Now,
as Aristotle speak's, it is a probable Topicke what a learned and honest man
delivers in matter of opinion; so for matter of fact, without doubt, what
virtuous men dare and did die for, is truth. It is the strongest assurance that
can be given to man of it. These men therefore, who affirmed, that they did
receive this most divine Truth supernaturally, ought to have a strong assent
given to what they say: Our evidence greater of future felicity then that ever
there was such a man as Julus Caesar.
I would ask him, what assurance he has that there was a Julius Caesar;
nothing but this, that it was a belief grounded upon, etc. (as he speak's of
this) yet I dare say, he is more assured that there was a Julius Caesar, then
he can be of any future worldly felicity although the evidence which is given
for that truth, is not to be compared with the evidence, given for this of our
future felicity; for he can never show me a man who durst dye for the defense
of that, as multitudes for the justification of this. This then, although it be
handed to us from man to man, as the other, yet it being delivered by such men
must needs have a persuasive force with it, more then other, which have a like
Tradition, but not by such undoubtable means.

Sect. 8.
But I will not leave him so; this Truth, that there is an eternal felicity
provided for men hereafter, Being not only delivered to us by Tradition, but
most consonant ^o Reason,
is not only by Tradition del^vered unto us, from such as had it
supernaturally revealed; bus is also most consonant to reason, and may most
reasonably be deduced out of its principles, and therefore ought most
seriously, and most faithfully to be confided in; that it is so, I will require
but one supposal, which I think I have cleared in my former Treatise, that
there is a God; this being granted, we must needs apprehend him provident over
those works of his, and, in particular, more eminently over man, which is the
most excellent piece of this fabric, and indeed the only piece which
actively honor's and dishonour's him; here now we find it not always true,
that men, who honor him, who forsake all, even their very lives for him here,
are blessed by him in this world, I mean with worldly blessings; yea, because
they forsake all, and their lives, they cannot be blessed here. Is it possible
to think that God will desert those which hold him so dear to them, and value
him at so high a rate? It is true, I read of Job and many others, that have had
a restitution of worldly comforts; but that is not so with all; and those that
dye for him leave the world, can have no reward in this world; Again, is it
possible that this God of an infinite excellency, wisdom, power, justice etc.
should suffer so many villains to eat up his Children and Servants, as it were
bread? to commit Sacrilege in all kinds? perjury, blasphemy and the like?
persevering in those sins, to pass without any punishment? which some do in
this world, (although but a few) supposing a God, men cannot think so; and
therefore, supposing a God, it is not to be imagined, but that there is an
eternal happiness provided for such as serve God, which is all I contend for.

Sect. 9.
Again, let us consider man in himself, as he is a fellow creature wi^h
beasts, In Man's fell^wship with other Creatures, and his excellency above them.
plants, stones, etc. we shall, upon consideration of all the Creatures in the
world, find that every Creature has an object fitted to any power it has, and
some matter or other fit to fill every empty room in it, and satisfy every
natural desire in it; to see this clear, let us first view the lowest sort of
things, stones, earth, water, air, etc. which have no life in them, if they
have power to operate by their quality, to heat or cool, there are objects in
the world fit for such actions; if they have appetites of this place or that,
high or low, there are room's in the world to receive them; if the matter (as
Aristotle) desire's forms, there are forms to fit it; you may find this truly
applied to any thing, according to that sacred Axiom, so often urged by both
Divines and Philosophers, Deus et Natura nihil faciunt frustra; whereas if
there were nothing to satisfy those powers and appetites, they were in vain;
if we climb higher to plants and Trees, which have life and no sense, it is
evident in them, that their powers and desires of nutrition, generation,
augment^tion, by which they exceed these inferior things, have, whilst they
are in this world, enough plentifully in this world to satisfy these appetites,
as well as those which they have in common with those other inferior things,
Then come to that other degree higher, to beasts and such things which do not
live only, but have a power of moving themselves, of apprehending by Sense, of
delighting themselves in sensual things; these appetites have that which can
satisfy, yea fill their desires, so that more cannot be desired; yea there is
to be had in this world not only a Satisfaction but a satiety of sensual
pleasure; not a belly full only, but enough to surfeit; so that, for all those
things below man, whatsoever they are, there is something which can
sufficiently sat^sfy all the powers and appetites they have. Can we think God
is so liberal to these things, and less to man? As the Apostle dispute's does
God take care of Oxen? that is, in comparison of us men; As our Savior, if he
so clothe the grass of the field shall he not much rather take care for us? if
he has so provided for them, in these mean faculties and appetites, which have
here (as the Schoolmen speak) vestigium Dei, only a footstep of God in them,
shall he not much rather for these noble powers and appetite of Reason and Will
in man, which are made after his image? certainly it were a high ingratitude to
think so; well then, let us inquire what satisfaction there can be found for
these humane powers of Reason and Will, by which he excells all other things,
that must be it which a man desire's, for every thing endeavour's the
perfecting of its powers, and the satisfaction of its appetite, which is truly
the good of that thing to which it belong's.

Sect. 10.
It is an undoubted conclusion, a Principle, if not the Principle, which the
inbred Law of nature, which governe's man, has taught every Child of man, and
so powerfully imprinted it in him, A very chi^d requires he satisfaction of his
Will.
that no Child, which has reason, will deny but that he would be happy; and in
particular, if he underst^nd the Terms, that that is his happiness, to have
all his desires, to have his Will satisfied; for, until that be, he has some
deficiency; there is something farther to be enquired after; he is not at h^s
journey's end; ^hus it is with all things, there is enough for any thing below
man to fulfill its appetite to ^urfeit; but not so, for man's appetite; this
will appear ou^ of the consideration of the things in this world which are
reputed good, A man's Will satisfied wi^h no wo^ldly goods, whether b^d^ly,
sensual, or intellectual.
those that are bodily, sensual, intellectual; bodily, strength, beauty,
health, these cannot satisfy a man's soul, though altogether; join to these
all sensual delights, meats, drinks, luxuriousness in any kind, for
hearing, seeing, smelling; let a man have all, those are but things which
beasts may enjoy as well as he, and in these he cannot excel them; yea they
excel him in a fuller fruition of them then he can have; then they are apt to
have many casualties to deprive us of them, and a certainty that one day they
must be lost, which to a man that has a forecast with him (which other
inferior Creatures have not) must needs disturb the content he might take in
enjoying them: consider those humane intellectual things, which have pretended
a title to man's felicity either the Stoick's Apathy, freedom from passion, or
the Aristotelian way of governing Passions by Reason, although those were
handsome and ingenious, and those men trod some steps toward felicity, yet
they were but the first Steps only, and those the lowest; for if the Subjects
be tumultuous, the King cannot be in safety. The Stoicke instead of ruling,
would kill his Subjects; take away all Passions, and then the King in man will
lack fitting instruments to effect his business; the Aristotelian governed, or
at the le^st prescribed rules to govern the Passions, but left the Palace of
Reason unrect^fied; and although he freed it from the rebellion of Passions,
yet satisfied it no^ with plenty at home; to conclude, that which make's a man
happy, and satisfie's his Soul, must be something in him, by which he excell's
beasts, that must be his Reason, and reasonable Will; this Will is not
satisfied but by knowledge; no satisfaction of it, but the enjoying that it
love's; no love without knowledge, and therefore though the Will be the seat of
happiness, yet the Understanding is the Conduit by which th^s happiness is
brought to the Will.

Sect. 11.
Now let us then examine what there can be in the Will, brought by the
Understanding, H^s knowledge ^s defective, and cannot do it.
which can satisfy it, and make it happy in this life; certainly all the
things in the world cannot do it; for although a man desire's to know any
thing, every thing, yet he cannot be happy in knowing all the things in the
world. I will not dispute concerning those things which men do know, for alas
it is mighty short of what men may know; the business of men's lives take them
so up, that he is a wise man who know's any thing in any one Art; many things
we know, quod sunt, yet we know not the things, nor the manner of them; in the
Mathematiques there is such a thing as quadratura circuli, but the work of it
is not found out; there is a certain number of the stars, but men do not
know it: there is a certain influence, but the most cunning Astrologer is
deceived in h^s prognostiques; this might be endless; but did any one man know
all these; did he know all the contrivance of Policies; were he expert in all
Mechanics, in natural knowle^ge, in Moral, in any of which never man was
perfect, yet his soul would not be full with all this, nor his appetite of
knowledge; for he must needs desire (when he knowe's all these) to know the
cause of all, which is God; as in Trismegistus his Poemander, when he asked
this Philosophic and knowing man, what he d^sired? he answered, I desire to
know things and their causes; the knowledge of any thing without their causes,
is not satisfactory to a man's soul; and although men are proud of little
Sciences, yet satisfied they cannot be without the knowledge of God, and his
causation of things; the world cannot fill the vastness of man's soul or
desire; they can, and do think of other worlds, and of him who is the cause of
all, and desire to know him; I speak not of the baser sort of men, who live
little otherwise then beasts; and then whom beasts are more happy; but of them
who live like men, excelling beasts by these divine faculties of reason and
will; these cannot choose but desire to know God: for knowledge is of Truth,
God is the fountain of all truth, from whence it came, yea Truth its self; and
therefore that Understanding, Nor ought else which is not infinite, and that
infinite is God.
which is carried to Truth; cannot be at rest until it come to know him
again; God is infinite, nothing can fill the understanding but what is
infinite. Let a Mathematician make the greatest number he can, another, yea
himself, in his understanding can make a greater; the Understanding of man can
grasp and contain any finite thing, and therefore is greater. Let him imagine
a world as great, a line as long as he can, yet the understanding of another,
yea his own, at a second act, can enlarge that, and make it greater; so that
whatsoever is finite cannot fill a man's Soul, but only what is infinite; and
therefore only God, who is infinite, can be satisfactory to man's
understanding. What I say for the Understanding, I say likewise for the Will;
what is less then infinite cannot satisfy it; I speak not of these beastly
sensual affections, they may be surfeited upon, yea the very enjoying them
make's men loath them: but of his humane Will, his intellectual, nothing can
satisfy that but what is infinitely good; Riches do it not, which bring with
them an impatient covetousness of getting more, when men have most.
let us look upon riches, and things of that nature, although they are thirsted
after most eagerly by man's ^easonable Will (no beast covet's Wealth) yet the
Soul of man is never satisfied with them, but they prove like fuel to the
fire, the more a man has the more he desire's they, who have so much as their
riches is a burden to them, are feign to lay the load upon other men's
Shoulders, their Servants to manage for them; yet these men desire more; he,
who is in mean estate, require's little additions to content him; when he has
gotten that, he has larger desires; when a Kingdom, another; a world; and
then grieve's he can have no more. I never read the desire of riches satisfied
in any man but him in the Parable, who cried, Soul take thine ease, for thou
have Treasures laid up for many ages; such fl^shes, and little inconsiderable
ej^culations of Content, men sometimes have, upon the enjoyment of worldly
wealth; but had that man been asked a little after, would you have another
Ba^ne full of Corn? he would have been of another mind, and have said, let me
have that, and tha^, and a thousand more; and had he all the wealth in the
world, unless this should be secured to him, that neither rust nor Moth shall
corrupt it, nor Thieves break through and steal it, yea that that great
Thief, death, shall not take him from it, his Will cannot be contented; which
yet was never granted to men in this world. I will not stay upon this; riches
are not things absolutely good, but relatively only, as they are referred to
other things, they are only bona vtilia, profitable goods, and that word
profit intimate's some other things that they are profitable for; and therefore
they who desire riches, desire some other thing for which these riches are
desired, and therefore they cannot satisfy that man's desire who covet's them,
but he must go further; in one word, to conclude this discourse, goodness,
happiness absolute, is the object of man's will; there is nothing good, but
God; all other things are partial goods, they have some good, but they lack
more then they have; and where there is a deficiency, that is not absolutely
good; therefore not any thing, not all things, can satisfy man's will, but he
only; for still there will be a further desire in the Covetous soul of man,
until they have him who is all good; Now then, if the Understanding can be
filled with nothing but God; if the Will can be satisfied with nothing but him;
it is most reasonable that there should be some such Condition, where these two
highest powers, which are given under the Sun, should be satisfied.

Sect. 12.
I will next enquire, whether this satisfaction can be in this life; if not,
sure there must be such a thing hereafter; and for this, it is first evident
that man has some knowledge of God in this life; Man has some imperfect
knowledge of God in this life.
he can by examining causes find that there must be a first; yea, he can from
thence affirm that he must be free from all imperfections, incorporeall,
immense, and the like, because Corporiety, Mensurability, finitenesse, argue
imperfection. Thus have men Philosophiz'd by reason: but the understanding is
not filled with this; as you may observe a Countryman, when he see's another
write, walk, speak, and the like, he can tell you, these are the effects of
some excellent principles in that man who does them; ask him, what it is? he
can, with all the world, tell you, it is his Soul; but ask, what that Soul
is? he is at a stand, he knowe's nothing of it; such are our thoughts of God,
from whose works of his we know there is a cause which bringe's these mighty
things to pass, which we call God; but what that God is, who does them, we are
at a loss, by all the reason man can find out; for as a dog can apprehend his
master's kindness to him, or his anger, yet cannot know the excellency of his
Master's Wisdom, power, etc. because he is in a lower rank of things then man
is; much less is man able to reach at that infinite excellency of God, being
many degrees much lower then God, than any Creature is below man. This is the
knowledge a man may have of God; if there be any thing else, it must be that
other way, in which many Divines have trod, besides these negatives of
imperfections, to conceive these things we call perfections to be in a much
more infinitely excellent manner in him who is God: So a husbandman may know
that a learned man exceed's him in knowledge, and that this knowledge is in
divine, natural, and moral things; but what that knowledge of his is, he
cannot tell, unless that learned man reveal it to him; so it is in respect of
God, None positively of his eminencies, but by revelation.
we know he has excellencies beyond us, that these consist in these or these
eminencies; but what is the nature of these eminencies, no man can know, but he
to whom God reveale's them; yet he cannot choose but desire to know them; But
it may here be said, that God has revealed these excellencies of his in his
holy book; he has revealed something of himself in Scripture, enough for a
viaticum, for a rep^st by the way, in a Riddle, darkely, behind a Cloud; by
which he believe's there are such things; yet faith cannot make men absolutely
perfect; it is the support, What Faith do^'s towa^d it.
the foundation of things hoped for; but Peregrinamur fide, we must be
strangers from happiness, whilst we live in faith; it is of things absent;
happiness consists in the fruition, the possession of what is present, which
cannot be so long as we are believing; Faith give's a man a nearer approach to
happiness, then any thing else in this world; and therefore a faithful man
can pass better through all the affronts of this world, then any other;
because he knowe's there is a happiness for him elsewhere; that he is
approaching to it; his conversation is in heaven, as S. Paul speaks; his
thoughts are there, his business and negotiation; this world belong's not to
him; but yet he is going to his happiness; only, he is not there, until he
put off his flesh and blood. There are other revelations to prophetique
persons, What dreams, visions, ecstasies etc.
by dreams, visions, and other apparitions, by which God is pleased to reveal
himself to some especial Servants of his; but these are of some particular
things, which cannot fill the vast understanding of man; there are likewise
ecstasies in some men, which (I guess) have had by them fuller and greater
manifestations of God; of that kind was that Saint Paul speake's of, in which
were unutterable mysteries; but these are very short, enough to give a man a
taste of heaven, not satisfy him; enough to make him long for more of the
same, and desire to be dissolved, and be with Christ; enough to give him an
eagerness of desire, mixed with the Comfort of assurance. He who has
happiness, as it must be full, so it must be ^onstant, without loss, or fear
of losing: for although beasts are happy in the present enjoyment of their
happy objects, because they have no forecast of any future evil, unless such
little Sagacities, and instincts of nature as dispose them to these, or these
provisions for the future; yet man, having foreseeing eyes, always looking at
what will become of him hereafter, cannot be happy in the present without
forecast of the future, what he shall be; and therefore these temporary
felicities cannot make him blessed.

Sect. 13.
What I have said of the Understanding, The several parts acted by the
Understanding and the Will, both which faculties are imperfect in this world.
may be applied to the Will; for the Understanding give's light to all the
Will's actions; and the reasonable Will cannot possibly enjoy any thing without
it: Therefore as the Understanding cannot in this world fully apprehend the
infinite good, neither can the Will enjoy it; the Will joye's in nothing which
is not present; and the Understanding is that only arm which embraces this
infinite good, and the only hand which lays hold of it to convey it to the
Will; and therefore, because the Understanding cannot fully, and clearly,
receive this infinite Goodness, neither Understanding, nor Will, neither of
these most excellent faculties, can be perfected in this World.

Sect. 14.
And now after this tedious discourse, The certainty of felicity after death
resumed and proved.
from which I can yet hardly withdraw my Pen, consider my Argument, and see if
in reason it may not yield a man as strong assurance as almost any natural
Truth, that there is a felicity after death: Consider the most apparent truths
which thy Reason can perswad^ thee to of things unseen; thou art ^ssured that
all men in all the world are mortal, and must dye: ask the reason; thou see,
or ^earest, that all here do so where thou live, and from thence can
collect that death belong's to all mankind: thou know that the fire burn's
in the Indies, because it has a power of burning, and an appetite to it
wheresoever it is: so I w^ll argue not from one Species, or sort of things, but
from all the things in this world: there is nothing in the world which has an
appetite not satisfiable, a power without an adequate subject, as Logicians
speak, therefore it must be in man, in whom certainly there can be nothing in
vain or imperfect; so that the certainty of this is drawn from the most
universal Principle that is in Nature, and such a Principle which is as
universally touched upon by Philosophers and Schoolmen, as any one whatsoever,
that Deus and natura nihil faciunt frustra; that frustra est potentia quae
nunquam reducitur in actum; which these powers should be, if there were no
felicity after this life, because there can be none absolutely here.

Sect. 15.
I know of but two things which can be objected here against this Conclusion,
and I will endeavor to satisfy them in order, severally.

Object. 1.
The first is, that although man cannot enjoy the complete full satisfaction of
these powers in this life, yet he may be happy in those little parcels of
knowledge of God, and his delight in that, by confining his desire and curbing
it in, sapere ad sobrietatem, as S. Paul speaks: and thus he will be happy
here in this life.

I answer, this may breed a moderate content, Ans. The Objection answered,
to^ching man's felic^ty in the knowledge etc. he has, though ^mperfect.
but not a happiness: Happiness is, th^n which no more can be desired; but
there is no man know's so much of God in this life, that he ought not to desire
more, because more is knowable; for although in the fullness of happiness the
whole blessed Vision is manifest in a glorious manner, at one act, and that
enjoyed; yet here we get it by piecemeal, now one, then another apprehension,
by parts, and pieces; and the Infiniteness of Divine perfections is such, that
no man's life, applied to nothing else, can compass a full apprehension of it;
yea, the further he goe's in this Journey, the further he finde's himself at a
loss, and behind with knowledge; therefore a man must not be content, but
strive for more knowledge; or if he have some content, yet this cannot be
satisfaction of the powers, but a curbing them, which yield's but a half
enjoyment, such as may be proper for a Viator, a Traveller to it, not a
possessor of happiness in hope, as the Prophet David say'th; but God is our
portion in the land of the living: we are here in the land of the dying, where
others and we die daily, and our happiness here is God, but God in hope; when
we come to the land of the living, God will be our portion and possession: to
conclude, men may have a begun happiness here, but no^ perfect until
hereafter: man perhaps may have content here, but felicity only in heaven
after life. A Traveller joye's his heart to see at a distance that happy Palace
where he hope's for comfort, but he is not satisfied until he come there: so
it is with us in our Journey to heaven; the happiness we have here is our hope
of it, but hereafter our possession.

The next Objection may be, Objection 2.
That this future Felicity is an Article of our Faith, the Conclusion of all
the Twelve, The resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting: Now if it
were demonstrable thus by reason, an act of Faith is not necessary to it.

Answer. A second Obj^ction answered, about Eternal felicity, being the last
Article of our Faith.
I can here bring the first and last Articles of our Faith together, that which
concern's God's creation, and this which concern's man's salvation, man's
beginning and end, which are both from God, and say, That for both of them
there is abundance of reason, but those Reasons cannot be easily argued by
every man; and yet though every man cannot Philosophize in high points of
learning, every man can believe these Conclusions which are proved by learned
men, and that belief is requ^red of every man; and surely belief has great
force to fasten men to that which they, upon good grounds, believe; no man
know's who is his Mother, but by his belief of very easy people to deceive,
and to be deceived; and yet this belief is constantly adhered unto by all sorts
of men, so that men dare depose, that such a one was this man's Mother, and
such this man's; none of us, that are not traveled in those parts, know that
there is a Constantinople, yet we are assured by hearsay, and are most
confident there is such a City: and stronger than all these may our Faith be of
this Truth, as I have showed; Faith and Reason do not destroy, but help, one
the other; for it is with our way to heaven, as to other places; when a man
has showed us one way, we can by that guess at another, which has proportion
and convenience to that; like lights, when you have kindled one Candle, you may
easily light others at that: when the Soul of man is enlightened by Faith, it
can with much more ease afterward inlighten Reason, which perhaps else it
would never have thought upon, and Reason sometimes assist's Faith; for when
the persons, we believe, deliver to be believed nothing but that is reasonable,
it is with comfort swallowed down and entertained, and the work of Faith has
less labor when it imposes no unreasonable thing. Thus you see the same
Conclusion may be the result of Faith and Reason, The same Conclusion may be
the result of Faith and Reason.
and therefore although proved in one, yet exalted as an Article in the other.

I could now insist upon the Article of Faith, how confirmed by Scripture, but
that is done by an hundred men before, and is evident too to every one that
looke's upon the New Testament: I could further enlarge upon that I have
already touched, concerning the Credibility and Fitness to believe those men
which delivered it to us, that certainly, as Festus said to S. Paul, An
Argument to confirm this, drawn from the H. Martyrs constancy in their
sufferings.
not he only, but all the rest were mad with learning, or something else, who
did endure so many afflictions, yea death, for Religion, if there were no
reward hereafter; and the Story of their sufferings was sealed to us by the
blood of thousands in diverse immediate Centuryes, and continued by the most
universally consented Story in the world: so that, for certainty we, have not
so much reason to believe any Article of the Faith (I speak of reason) nor any
Conclusion delivered by relation, as this one, That there is a Blessedness
hereafter for God's servants* because this is the reason, and chief reason, why
these men durst dye for Religion; this made Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,
Dan. 3. despise the fire for Gods cause; the Heroic Sons, 2 Mac. 7. contemn
Tortures with a most noble Constancy, because they looked for a better and
happier life; so, as it is phrased Hebr. 12.1. We are compassed about with a
mighty cloud of Witnesses, or indeed a cloud of mighty Witnesses, to evidence
the Truth: Mr. Hobbes therefore did not do this noble heavenly Conclusion
right, Mr. Hobbes suspected of a design, to disparage the foresaid Article of
our ^aith.
when he said, [ It is received only upon a belief, grounded upon other men's
saying, that know it supernaturally, or that they know those that knew them,
that knew others, that knew it supernaturally] which was a disgraceful
expression, and, I can justly fear, intended to that purpose, to disparage this
Article; for let a man consider his Conclusion which follows, [ Breach of Faith
cannot be called a Precept of Reason, or Nature*] This, he says, was opposed
by some who held killing of Sovereigns lawful: this seemed out of his
premises to be argued; for thus, That which conduces to future felicity ought
to be done; but the breach of faith in killing of Sovereigns conduces to
future felicity, therefore etc. what need had he any way to have disgraced our
hope of heaven; it might have served his turn much better to have showed how
the God of Truth love's Truth, and hate's Falsehood; how unpossible it is that
Error and Falsehood should be the way to Truth, how inconsistent they are: these
things would abundantly have served his turn, and have contented the Reader;
but to leave that, and fall foul, without occasion, upon our hope of heaven,
was very ill done of him.

Sect. 1.
I Leave this now, and on with him [ Others (says he) that allow, for a Law of
Nature, the keeping of Faith, do nevertheless make exception of certain
persons, as heretics etc.] I condemn this with him, but do not approve his
reason for it, which is [ If any fault of a man be sufficient to discharge our
Covenant made, the same ought in reason to have been sufficient to have hindered
the making of it.] I allow not this answer, Several qualific^tions, good and
bad, in the making and breaking Covenants.
because it destroye's that supposition, upon which it was grounded, which is
that men have made a Covenant; now the question is, whether that Covenant may
lawfully be broke; this is no satisfaction, to say, that there was the same
reason not to make the Covenant, as to break it, for both may be amiss, to
make it rashly, and to break it rashly; and one may be well, another ill; as to
covenant to do any honest thing, the Covenant was good, the breach ill; So
likewise the Covenant may be ill, and the breach good, as in those examples
before instanced in; not as it is a (...) of ^aith but of that wicked bond;
nay* I can show made a Covenant with another, may do it with an orthodox man,
or with one not apparent to be other, and yet the man afterward turn
heretic, or discover his heresy; in that case it is not possible for the
Covenanter to find the same reason in making, as was in breaking his Covenants;
so that, although his Conclusion be true, that faith is to be kept with all
men, yet his foundation and ground, upon which he built it, was faulty: Indeed
the ground upon which his conclusion is established is, that God is the God of
truth, that Religion destroye's not, but perfects moral virtues, amongst
which, veracity Truth-speaking, is a principal one, and therefore cannot teach
to break faith with any one: I would have these men who taught that doctrine,
consider, how it had been possible for the Apostle to have enlarged Christian
Religion amongst the Gentiles, if they had broached such a doctrine, so odious
to humanity: but they taught the quite contrary, as is evident; I let it pass,
and proceed.

Sect. 2.
His application of Justice and Injustice to men, and actions, is ingenuous,
but at the bottom of the page 74. he endeavors to show that sometimes damage
is done to one, when the Injury is done to another [As when the Master commands
his Servant to give money to a Stranger; if it be not done, the Injury is done
to the Master, whom he had before Covenanted to obey: but that damage
redoundeth to the stranger to whom he had no obligation] this is handsome, No
damage without inju^y.
but a little too fine: for I am persuaded that no damage can be where is no
loss; loss cannot be where a thing is not had; he that has nothing can lose
nothing; for his instance, the Stranger had right to his Master's kindness;
and the same bond, which tied the Servant to obey his Master in that command,
obliged him likewise to give it to the stranger; and that bounty of the Master
so justly entitled the stranger to it* as that Servant, who defrauded him of
it, is bound in Conscience to make him restitution afterward for that injury.
He has another instance, by which he endeavour's to illustrate this
proposition, at the top of 75 page [ In commonwealths private men may remit to
one another their debts; but not robberyes, or other violences, whereby they
are endammaged] how does this prove that injury may be done to one, and the
damage to another? any man may forgive, or remit any damage, or injury (no
damage without Injury) so far as it concerne's himself, but not wherein it
concerne's another; nor does his following reason speak any more; Because
(says he) the detayning of debt is an Injury to themselves; but Robbery and
violence are injuries to the Person of the Common-wealth] So then it seem^s, by
him, that damage is not without Injury; when the Commonwealth is dammaged, it
is injured; where a private man is dammaged, he is injured; and either of these
may remit those damages or Injuries are done to them, and their parts in the
same act, when one and the same act does often endammage and injure both; but
neither can justly intermeddle with the other's interest.

Sest. 3.
He proceed's, [ Justice of actions is by writers divided into Commutative and
Distributive] This distinction he censure's; I shall censure him for it, The
explication of Commutative and Dist^ibutive justice.
but before I do that, that my judgment may appear more clear, when it is
applied to the several particulars, I will permit an explication of that
division, how it is understood by the consent of those he call's writers, which
are Schoolmen, Casuists and Moral Philosophers.

To which is premised that of common or legal justice*
Thus they discourse of Justice: Justice of actions is either in the act^ons of
a particular, relating to the whole body of the Commonwealth; or of the body
or whole to par^iculars; or of particulars one to another, The first ^hey call
Communis Iusti^ia* or legalis, common or legal Justice; Common, because it
concerne's the community, and legal, because it has the same intent with all
Laws, which is the public benefit: or else because it is required by the law
of that nation, or some Aphorism of the law of nature, which dict^te's that
the whole should be preserved rather then any particular; of this sort are the
performance of those duties and services which are required by ^he laws of the
Land, as the repaires of Highways, paying public Taxes in to the Exchequer;
yea, to expose a man's life to danger for the public good, and preservation of
either Church, or State. The second sort, of the whole to particulars, is that
they call Distributive justice, which is apparent in the rewarding and
punishing of men; and in this is required a Geometrical proportion, which
require's four terms, as thus; such a proportion as two has to four, has
three to six, it is just half; or such as six has to eight, fifteen has to
twenty, it is three parts of four; thus when a Parish relieve's the poor with
the public Stock, such a family as has three bedridden people in it must have
treble the relief of that which has but one, out of the public Stock: So in
disposing Offices, it is justice that he who merit's accordingly, should be
exalted to dignity, and rewards proportionable; he, who h^th merit for a
Captain, a Captain's place; a Colonel, a Colonel's; and so in all professions;
and it is not justly done in him who has the dispensation of these Dignities,
to give the less worthy the place of more worth, and the more worthy the place
of less worth.

The third kind is of particular men one with another, and this they term
Commutative Justice, which consist's in exchanges and the trade and negotiation
one man has with another; to this they assign the measure Arithmetical, which
is so much as the other, five for five: he, who has right to five shillings,
must have five shillings, and no more; he, who has so much damage, must* in
justice, have so much satisfaction, and no more, without any consideration of
merit or demerit; virtue or vice; a shilling's worth of work must be paid with
a shilling: this is the general Doctrine which is delivered by Writers
concerning Justice. Let us see what he except's. What he writ is not true;
Justice of Actions is not by Writers divided into Commutative and Distributive;
when he says, Justice of Actions, he must understand Justice in its general
notion, which, by the consent of all Writers, is first divided into legal or
common Justice, and particular; Many acts of Justice being not comprehended
under the other two.
there are many acts of Justice which are not compr^hended under these two; I
mean not only the acts of those that are called Theological Virtues, Faith,
Hope, and Charity, which are just acts, but are not contained in this Division;
but there are many acts of Moral Justice which are none of these; as thus, It
is a gallant and heroic act of justice, for a man to adventure his life for
the Safety of his Country; justice it is, because due to his Country, that
any one part should perish rather than the whole; but neither Commutative, nor
Distributive Justice, as may appear. It is a just action, in the danger of the
Commonwealth running to hazard, for a wise man to interpose his advise, to
rescue it from that menacing ruin; yet it is neither of these two; it is a
just act (I think) for me to write these notes upon his Book; to admonish men
to avoid the danger it threaten's, if not prevented; but not distributive or
Commutative Justice, but that which is called Common or legal justice, which
looke's to the public good; so that you see, there are many acts of justice
legal not comprehended under these heads, and this commonly delivered by
Writers; but his exceptions are against the other two. His first quarrel is
against the doctrine of Commutative; and it is thus;

Sect. 4.
[ Commutative therefore they place in the equality of the value of the things
contracted for, as if it were injustice to sell dearer then we buy; or to give
more to a man than he merit's,] so here are two arguments against an
Arithmetical proportion in Commutative Justice, Argument 1. against an
Arithmeticall proportion in Commutative Just^ce examined.
I will examine them both [ as if it were injustice to sell dearer then we buy]
That Is the first: This is not a good consequence, for the value of every thing
is not to be considered only from its own intrinsecall virtue and excellency;
but, as he speak's handsomely afterward, from [ the appetite of the buyer] yea
from many external accommodations which a thing has, By what the price of any
thing may ^e enhaunsed.
as from that pains and industry the owner took in getting these goods; from
the hazard he made in getting them; from the necessity or pleasure he has of
those things; all which may justly raise the price of any commodity, and are,
in themselves, things valuable: I could instance in every particular; but it is
obvious, and it is delivered by all Casuists, that these things are honestly to
be priced, and valued, by the Seller; he speake's ingenuously, when he says, a
little after, that [ The value of all things contracted for is measured by the
appetite of the Contractors] so tha^ where there is a certain contract, the
Arithmetical proportion, in Commutative Justice, is to be reckoned from the
words of the Contract, not from the inward value of the thing contracted for;
the first is certain, the other will always be dubious: you may observe in the
second Book of the Kings, The Asse's head and kab of Pigeons dung in the Siege
of Samaria.
6.25. that, in the Siege of Samaria, an Asse's head was sold for fourscore
pieces of silver, and a kab of Pigeons dung for five pieces of silver: this
had no Arithmetical proportion to the internal worth of the things, but as they
were priced by the Seller's necessity, which is a valuable addition to any
thing which is sold: So that, in express contracts, the sense of the Contract
is always to be considered in Commutative justice; but Commutative justice
has to do in many things where there are not verbal and certain Terms
exp^essed, and, in such Dealings, the Arithmetical proportion must, in some
rule, When the Arithmeticall proportion must be applied to the value of the
thing.
be applied to the value of the thing, as thus, in a clear Instance; A man has
hired many to reap in his field, he finde's another idle; bid's him go to work
with the rest; he does his Days work with them; he ought to be paid,
according as he paid the other men, because although there was not a punctual
Contract, yet, it is evident, he valued a man's Dayes-work at such a rate: So
likewise, as I have known a Master and a Servant-man contract oft-times in
private, at the quarter* Day they Differ about the Wages; the Master says so
much, the Servant, more; it is just the Servant should be paid; in those
Countries where there are Statute-Wages determined, which ought to be in all,
they have a recourse to that Standard, and there it shall be valued how much.
Thus, where Contracts are expressed, the Terms of them expound the
Arithmetical proportion; but where not, the value must some other way be
examined, and that applied. And this may suffice, for answer to his first
Argument, which said, we might not then sell dearer than we buy: for, upon many
occasions we may, and it is just to do so: As to his Confirmation, That the
Contractors appetites values all things: it is true, that the Arithmetical
proportion is considered according to the Contract; but where there is no such
Contract, there the inte^n^l value of the thing is only considered; but in
both an Arithmetical proportion is considered, which he seemed to be displeased
with.

Sect. 5.
2. Argument against it answered.
His second Argument is, That [ if this proportion should be observed, then it
were injustice to give more than a man deserves.] This Argument may be blown
away with saying, that giving, or not giving, have nothing to do with justice;
giving belong's to another virtue, called Liberality; acts of Justice are acts
of Du^ty; acts of Giving are acts of Bounty: but this I may tell him, that it
were an act of Injustice for that Judge or Umpire, A Judge or Umpire (...) by
the rule of justice.
in a Case of Commutative Justice, betwixt John A-stiles and John An-oakes, who
should make John A-stiles to give John An-oakes but a little more than the
Arithmetical proportion was due to him; he may give him out of his own purse
what he pleases; but, out of justice, he can compel John A-stiles to give no
more, or rather pay no more, than a shilling-worth of money for a
shilling-worth of work, unless for costs, or cause of (...): So that* here* his
second Argument against (...) another man has merited, but he cannot justly be
forced to pay more.

Sect. 6.
Now what followe's, I think, reflect's upon Distributive justice: [Merit
(says he) (besides that which is by Covenant, where the performance on one
part meriteth the performance of the other part, and falls under Justice
Commutative, not Distributive) is not due by Justice, but is rewarded of Grace
only.] This Proposition is not sense, which is, Merit is not due by Justice,
but Grace only; the rest is a Parenthesis: no merit can properly be said to be
due, but the thing merited; or else, it may be, that merit, such as he meane's,
has nothing due to it by justice, but by grace; as much as if he should say,
that where is no Covenant, nothing is due out of justice, but grace.

This I take to be very erroneous; As first, What may be due, by both kinds of
Justice, without Covenant.
in Commutative then Distributive justice; in Commutative, restitution of fame,
health, estate, when a man has secretly injured another, is due, out of
Commutative justice; he ought to make reparations, for injuries done in those
things; but it is not possible to conceive that such a man, who injured
another, should contract with him to make him satisfaction for that injury. The
like we may find in Distributive justice; take the Instance before; Every
Parish is to relieve the poor which belong's to it; suppose three poor; one,
weak with old age, can do somewhat for his living; another so decrepid, that
he is able to do nothing; a third beyond the former, both himself, and his
wife, perhaps a child, all disabled to help themselves; those several persons
never contracted with the Overseers of the poor of that place for any alms;
they never, upon Covenant, acted any thing which fore-merited th^s relief; ye^,
of justice Distributive, those several miserable people ought, by the Ove^see^s
of the poor, in a Geometrical proportion, to be so relieved: So, in Colleges,
there are diverse degrees of Places, and in many with this Clause, Let the most
worthy be preferred; suppose now two Places void, and two unworthy, or not so
worthy as some other two, should be preferred; were not thi^ injustice, that
the less worthy of the two most eminent should be preferred to the best Place,
and the more worthy to the worst? this is injustice in Distributive justice;
yet neither of these made a Covenant to oblige the other Fellows: I am
persuaded Mr. Hobbes, when he wrote this, thought to have merited so much of
all the Leviathans in Christendom, (or, at the least, from the Protector) that
they ought to have preferred him to some great Office in their State: but yet,
I am confident, he never contracted with any for the reward: for merit arises
not only from grace or favor, but duty and justice; although Commutative
justice only consider's the case, yet Distributive casts an eye principally
upon the person, and his qualifications. He conclude's, [ therefore this
distinction, in the sense wherein it uses to be expounded, is not right] The
sense, in which it uses to be expounded, is that sense I have delivered, and,
by what I have delivered, it appeare's right. F^^st, in Commutative justice an
Arithmetical proportion must be considered: and secondly, in Distributive a
Geometrical.

Sect. 7.
He goe's on, [ To speak properly, Commutative Justice is the Justice of a
Contractor, that is, a Performance of Covenant in Buying and Selling, etc.]
Thi^ I have showed erroneous: see him again, [ And Distributive Justice, the
Justice of an Arbitrator, that is to say, the act of defining what is Just;
Wherein (beinst trusted by them who made him Arbitrator,) if he perform his
Trust, he is said to distribute to every man his own: The justice of an
Arbitrator different, according to the Case.
] Here is one c^se put for twenty of a diverse nature: It is is true, in such a
case, an Arbitrator may do an act of Distributive justice, as in dividing of
an estate betwixt Wife and Children, and many other of such condition, when
there ought to be a regard of differing relation, and necessity; but many
times, in a Reference to an Arbitrator, the case may be clearly an act of
Commutative justice; and, according to that justice, all the goods, contended
for, must, to a penny, be assigned, according to an Arithmetical proportion,
without any consideration of several merits; and, in such a case, there is no
distribution, to diverse their own: So that the justice of an Arbitrator may be,
according to the Case in which he is to arbitrate, either Commutative, or
Distributive; what he adde's, that [ This, which he had delivered before,) is
Just Distribution; and may be called (though improperly) Distributive Justice]
is hard to be apprehended; Mr. Hobbes (...) nice and singular in his language.
and how it should be, indeed, just distribution, yet improperly Distributive
justice, poseth me, and (I think) will him, to explain, unless he understand
the first to be an act, the second a virtue or habit of justice, which is
countenanced with no one phrase used by him; [ but (says he) more properly
equity] why should he undertake not to cross the language received amongst the
common people only, but the community of learned men, with a bare affirmation?
he must use it otherwise than all Authors before; Equity is a rule, by which
men must walk in the acts of all justice; but the virtue is Justice, by which
men deal equally, whether Arbitrator or private person. His mistake in the
division of justice.
In this Treatise of Justice, you may discern him to blame, in saying that [
Writers divide Justice, into Commutative and Distributive,] in which he was
mistaken; for Justice is first divided into legal or Common justice, and
particular; it is particular justice only which is divided into Commutative and
Distributive; Secondly, he was to blame to deny, that Commutative justice is to
be acted according to an arithmetical proportion, In his measure of commutative.
measuring it only by the things commuted; when he knowe's, that all Casuists
allow twenty Circumstances, which may enhanse the price. Thirdly, he was
mistaken, when he said, [ then it were lawful to give more to a man then he
merits;] Fourthly, he did not deliver the truth, when he said, there is no
merit from justice, but grace only, where the distribution is made; Fifthly, he
said too much, when he said [ Distributive justice is the act of an Arbitrator;
and Commutative of a Contractor.] And here let the Reader consider, whether it
be not a bold undertaking of Mr Hobbes, His boldness in confronting all the
learned men before him.
to confront all the learned men in the world; Schoolmen, Philosophers,
ancient and latter, Casuists, Politicians, (all which with one Consent, honor
and approve this distinction,) upon so weak grounds as are put down here; I
remember no one Author that opposes it; I am confident, I have looked upon an
hundred; only Bodin in his sixth book de Republica, cap. 6. where he cavill's
at this distinction, Bod^n's cavil.
methinkes, as if he thought that Aristotle would have had a Commonwealth
governed by these distinctly, one, or the other; but not have used them both at
the same time, in his Commonwealth; and then the necessities of both in their
several opportunities would have made one, alone, improper, and therefore he
adds a third and new proportion, unheard of before, which he imagine's would
complete the work, which he call's harmonica proportio; His aie^y conceit of an
harmonical proportion.
but I can guess it a mere airy conceit, not clearly expressed by him, nor
intelligible by any; for he can never show how the proportions in Music should
correspond to the Offices in a Commonwealth, which must be done, if he make
that proportion the only rule for it; and therefore it has gained no ground
upon the judgment of learned men; and I believe Mr. Hobbes his opinion will
gain as little. But, to have my Judgment, Mr. Hobbes was angry with it,
because the Schoolmen use it, and would not allow himself patience to examine
their Grounds.

Sect. 8.
I pass over the rest of that Chapter, in which are some things most
ingenious, as his discourse of Complacencie, in the 76 page, and in some other
things: but that most of all he crowde's in that abominable Aphorism before
refuted: that all men are naturally at war one with another, until I come to
the last Clause, where he falls foul again upon all manner of writers, page
80. where he says, Mr. Hobbes's restraint of Moral Philosophy.
that [ the Science of Virtue and Vice is Moral Philosophy.] This so far is
true, that it is a good piece of moral Philosophy, to treat of the Law of
Nature, and to show how all virtuous actions are deduced out of it, and agree
with it; but this is not all the Office of a moral Philosopher; he is first to
teach the end, which is man's Summum bonum, his chief good; his felicity,
happiness, then to teach the means, which are those virtues deduced out of
the Law of nature, and to show how they conduce to the end; so that he confined
moral Philosophy in too narrow bounds, when he restrained it to Virtue and
Vice, which are only the means, and are handled by a moral Philosopher only
in order to his end. Now he come's to his high strain again, censuring the
world.

Sect. 9.
But (says he) the writers of moral Philosophy, though they acknowledge the
same Virtues and Vices; yet, not seeing wherein consists their Goodness, nor
that they come to be praised, as the means of peaceable, sociable, and
comfortable living, place them in a mediocrity of passions, as if not the
cause, but the Degree of daring, made Fortitude; or not the Cause, but the
quantity of a gift made liberality.] There are many things in this Period to be
cen^ured, First, His censure of all Philosophers.
I blame him for accusing the whole Company of the Philosophers of ignorance,
in so weighty a business, not so much as pardoning any one; when, for my part,
who have turned over hundreds of books in this business, I know no one so
blind as himself in this particular point, I say no one, either Christian, or
other; for first he commits a mighty fault in forgetting that famous
distinction, He forget's the distinction of a good man and a good Citizen.
betwixt a good man, and a good Citizen, acknowledged by multitudes of
Philosophers, and must needs be by any man, who consider's that a man may be
discoursed of, either concerning himself in his own nature, and the ways of
perfecting it; or else in relation to others; in the first consideration, that
Science which perfect's him is called Ethicke or Moral Philosophy: The
foundation of Ethikes, Oeconomikes Politikes.
for the second, which referre's him to others, it is either to a family, then
it is Oeconomick; or else to a State or City, and then it is Politic. Now the
writers of moral Philosophy discourse which way a man should perfect himself;
so that they give Ru^es, which way he should be happy in a desert; in the midst
of the most unhappy state in the world; in the midst of worldly plenties,
miseries: such surely are perfect in this world; and such only; and this is
the foundation of all Oeconomicks and Politics: no man can be either
O^conomically or Politickly virtuous, who is not so in himself; and being so
in himself, having neither family nor City to dispose himself to, he may not be
such to other men. Mr. Hobbes dedicate's a m^n wholly to others in this place,
as in others he make's a man dispose all things to himself, and consider's not
the diverse sh^res which his Parents, his friends (I may add) his Children*
and, above all, his God, is to have out of him, as well as his Country. Now Mr.
Hobbes places the whole relation of man to be toward others, when in this
period he says in effect, That,

Sect. 10.
[ The Philosophers did not know that humane virtues came to be praised as the
means of peaceable, sociable, and comfortable living] which are things only
in respect of others: but I may tell Mr. Hobbes, that, in their politics and
O^conomicks, Personal and relative perfect^on how taught by Philosophers.
they teach this relative perfection as fully, and much truer, then hd, as will
appear; but in Ethics they teach how these virtues are excellent in
themselves, and do perfect the owner; this is done by all sorts of
Philosophers; to begin with the Epicureans, whose Philosophy does, in many
things, Mr. Hobbes's Philosophy compared with that of Epicurus.
agree with his, although, in some things, he consent's with the Stoics; in
mine opinion he chooses the worst pieces in both; first Epicurus agree's with
him in this, that he makes pleasure the happiness, the chief good of man, as
Mr. Hobbes does in many places; and I know Lactantius favour's Epicurus so
much, as to say, he meant the pleasures of the soul; yet surely it seems to
be the sensual part of the Soul only; for, in that Epistle he writes to
Menoeceus, which is the chief we have of his moral Philosophy, he seeme's to
me to do otherwise; and places man's happiness, as Mr. Hobbes does elsewhere,
in the enjoying sensual Contentments: now Mr. Hobbes, in those other places,
did better then in this, where he placed man's happiness within himself, and
the use of his virtues conducing to himself; but here in relation to others,
which is so extrinsecall a thing, as it is impossible for a man (...) be happy
in; for it is possible a man may lack these accommodations of other men, to
converse, and be sociable, and affable with; and then he is not happy, who can
be miserable, which Epicurus himself denied to be possible to a virtuous and
prudent man; so that, in respect of the end, although Epicurus make the same
happiness, as Mr. Hobbes in other places, yet Epicurus, and Mr. Hobbes in
other places, speak righter then Mr. Hobbes in this. Then, consider the means
of obtaining this end: Epicurus first writes against the fear of the Gods, as
he call's them; a thing, which Mr. Hobbes countenanceth, although he let us fall
in one place (as Mr. Hobbes now and then will) that God does punish wicked men,
and bless the honest and virtuous; yet he after speake's against man's fear
of any such thing; because (says he) nothing must be spoken of the Gods, but
eternal felicity, which they could not have if they were concerned in humane
affairs, and therefore denies, prayers, or any religious duty, to have any
power with the deities, as I remember, Mr. H^bs, out of his Stoical principles
of the fate or necessity which belong's to all things, and actions. Cross
principles produce the same wicked conclusion in both, like as Herod and Pilate
join together in nothing but crucifying Truth; To the same purpose Lucretius
(a follower of Epicurus) speak's in his first, fifth and sixth books; With that
of Lucretius.
and diverse times make's it the greatest piece of happiness, to abhor
Religion and contemn it; and make's man, by that act, to be the greatest
Conqueror. Quare religio pedibus subjecta vicissim
Obteritur, nos exaequat victoria Caelo.
And one of Mr, Hobbes his Principles of religion is made by him to be the
chief, the ignorance of second causes. Thus do men, who conspire against
Religion, meet likewise in the means: But Epicurus and Lucretius spoke out
fully, Mr. Hobbes darkely; thus they join in one Principle, by which
happiness may be acquired; but, in another, Epicurus far exceed's him; for
placing happiness, as he does, in the enjoyment of this world's contentments,
Epicurus's excellent discourse concerning Death.
Epicurus contemne's and despises death, and will not allow it to be any
evil, and dispute's most excellently, to prove it is not to be feared, for
(says he) that is not to be feared which hurt's not (a true rule, for those
things are only to be feared being absent, which, when they are present, will
hurt us). Now (says he, death hurt's no man, for when death come's, man is
not, therefore not hurt by it; It hurt's neither the living, nor the dead,
says he; not the living, for, whilst men live, death is not; not the dead, for
where death is, man is not: The force of this Argument is necessary, because in
all Injuries or hurts, that come, there must be these two Terms, the thing
hurting and that hurted, but these can never be together, death and man: now
herein he excell's Mr. Hobbes, for whether Mr. Hobbes make's man's happiness
to consist in the enjoying the world, or in a Complacencie or contentment with
other men; yet, when he make's death so fearful a thing, as he does, it is in
vain for that man to look for happiness, who knowe's he must die, when he
shall lose this happiness, and he may die this day, and suddenly lose it, by
that which he, and such men, make their greatest evil, death: so that
Epicurus, and his Sect, went beyond Mr. Hobbes, and spoke more justifiably, out
of these Principles, then he did. But Epicurus goe's on, and deliver's, how
these sensual pleasures are to be preserved, Frugality and Temporance.
by Frugality, and temperance; two virtues which I cannot find in Mr. Hobbes
his whole book, which yet necessarily conduce to the preservation of this
felicity; Frugality, that so the stock may be supported, which must maintain
his pleasures; Temperance, which [ is a moderate use of them, that so he may
enjoy them the fuller; Frugality preserve's the fuel, Temperance the fire; and
(as he speake's) the enjoyment of a man's pleasure does not consist in the use
of luxurious superfluities, but in the proportion the object has to the
appetite, or the necessity of the man who enjoye's it. So a hungry, needy, and
necessitous man find's as great pleasure in a Crust of bread, and a draught of
water, as any riotous person does in his greatest excess of dainties. Now I
read, in Mr. Hobbes, nothing of these two, which are as necessary as any, for
the happiness which sensual pleasures can bring to a man; and therefore,
although I think, this Sect erred as much as any in his moralls; yet, I think
likewise, that these writers did think more truly then he, wherein the
goodness of these virtues (of which he speake's) consists, that is, making,
men happy; and gave better reasons, for what they said, then he. I have dwelt
longer upon this Sect, both because few men have described it aright, which I
have read; and likewise because it containing as ill, or worse, opinions, then
any other, has suffered most justly, under the general Censure of Writers.
And, although it being a doctrine which flattered our flesh and blood, and
thereby, for a while, got a great applause amongst men, and the readers of this
Philosophy, like Ranters in divinity, were much followed for a while; yet in
the passages of an age or two, it was cried down; and I know not of any late
writers, Mr. Hobbes approaches nearer the worst of the Epicureans then do the
Mahumetans.
who has so nearly insinuated his worst opinions, as this Author, with whom I
have to do, unless it be the Mahumetans, who agree with the Epicureans in
this, that sensual pleasure is the happiness of man; but here they differ;
the Mahumetans make that happiness ete^nall hereafter: but Epicurus (with whom
Mr. Hobbes seeme's to shake hands) in this world only.

Sect. 11.
To discourse of the Stoicke Philosophy, were needles, Wherein the Stoics
placed hum^ne happiness.
because the common Authors, which are read by the generality of men, as Tully,
Seneca, Epictetus, do manifestly show how they placed humane happiness in his
own breast, and in his power, which is the enjoyment of himself, without the
disturbance of passions. And, to this end, they imposed that impossible means
of rooting out passions, as living only by reason; which certainly, if it
could be done, would make man's life like that of the Angels; or his bodily
life like his spiritual, And these Cardinal virtues, Prudence, Justice,
Fortitude, Temperance, to be the supports of all this work; and that man's
happiness has no dependence upon any thing without him; these certainly
carried with them much more persuasive reason to induce the end, which these
virtues aimed at, then any thing Mr. Hobbes has delivered. Wherein Aristotle.
Then, for Aristotle, who, as appeare's, in the tenth of his Ethickes, Cap. 7.
make's, first, the happiness of man to consist in action, and that in the
noblest action of man, which is of man's Understanding; then in the
excellentest Act of his Understanding, which is Contemplation; and last of all,
in the perfectest act of Contemplation, which is the Contemplation of God. I
will not discourse his reasons, which were worthy his writing this way. A man
may be happy alone without any reference to a Commonwealth, yea the business
of public affairs would but hinder and distract this; and throughout that
book, these virtues are taught in relation of this chief Good of man, his
happiness, in which he may well rest, and seek no further; but, in his
Politiques, he shewe's how the same virtues conduce to the public; Mr. Hobbes,
therefore, was much to blame, when he, in general, passed so weak (though
cruel) a Censure upon the universality of moral Philosophers, as to say, they
did not see wherein the goodness of these Virtues, they wrote of, consisted:
and his instance is as much to blame, which is, that

Sect. 12.
[ Those Writers place them in the mediocrity of passions, as if not the Cause,
but the Degrees of daring, made Fortitude; Mr Hobbes m^stake's the Philosophers
discou^se of moderating assions.
or not the Cause, but quantity of a gift, made liberality; He is mistaken,
almost in every word he writ. First that moral virtue, called Justice, is not
in the passions, nor in any thing that has not reason; So I may say by
prudence, nor do Philosophers say it is; nor are many of the laws of nature
(as he calle's them) written in these inferior faculties, but in the
superior; nor do these men, who write of these things, so foolishly discourse
of those virtues, whose nature is busied about the moderating of passions, as
if there were no more to do but to bridle a man's passions; but then finding it
necessary for the attayning man's happiness in this World, that men's passions
must be curbed, without which, like an unruly horse, these passions will
transport a man to a thousand inconveniences, and not be governed by Reason,
but run away with it; these virtuous habits subdue those passions, that they
act so far, and no farther, then prudence, and right Reason shall direct them;
so that men's passions facilitated by Custom, to the yoke, are made to stop,
turn or move, according to time, place, persons, manner of working, quantity
of working, all Circumstances, as Prudence and right Reason shall prescribe:
And this Philosophy St. Paul taught, Gal. 5.24. and tearme's it crucifying the
flesh and the passions of it, 1 Cor 9. ult. I keep under, St. Paul's Philosophy.
or beat down my body (that is) keep it in subjection, lest* while I preach to
others, I my self should be a cast away: he that keepe's not under his body,
his flesh, and the passions of it, can never regulate them according to Reason;
and therefore this Philosophy of theirs was most excellent, according to true
grounds of Reason; but his Censure is much mistaken, where he seeme's to make
those Philosophers only terminate the moderation of these passions in
themselves, and not reflect them upon that is most desirable, the subjecting
them to Reason, which all I meet with do. And the mistake runne's in the
instance given.

Sect. 13.
[ As if not the Cause, but the degrees of daring made Fortitude; or not the
Cause, but the quantity of a gift made liberality.] I wonder, when he read any
writer of note so absurd, Of Fortitude and liberality.
as he make's all Philosophers in general: for Fortitude, they make it (as all
other) to consist in mediocrity; it is excelled by temerity, or rashness; it
is defective in Cowardlinesse; and these are both degenerations from the virtue
Fortitude; which Fortitude is to dare do that (what danger soever be in it)
which Reason prescribe's; and to forbear to do that (what advantage soever
shall accrue) which just Reason shall forbid. Take an Instance in that man of
God, David, in Sam. 17. we may read that he durst encounter with a Lion and a
Bear, to rescue an innocent Lamb out of their mouths: he dare's fight with
Goliath in complete armor, with nothing but a sling and a stone, to rescue his
Country; yet a little after we shall read of him flying out of his Wifes Window
for safety: yea, in the 26. of the same book, we shall find David, and only
Abishai with him, entering the whole army of Saul: an Act than which nothing
could be more bold or hazardous; and taking his Spear, and bottle from his
holster, and yet, he durst not touch his person, for committing of treason;
each an act of true Fortitude, to dare so much, when it was fit, and dare do
no more, when it was fit; no not for a Kingdom: the Rules of Fortitude, are,
not to fear, or hope for any thing, but upon the guidance of right Reason; So
that the daring to say, or do unjust actions, is opposite to fortitude: I may
say the like of liberality, it has two vices nigardlinesse and prodigality; It
is prodigality, profusely to throw away man's estate, or loosely to wast it,
upon idle and vain persons and occasions; but it is nigardlinesse, to grudge
his own, or other men's necessi^ies, that which he can spare from his
Conveniences. Fortitude, Liberality, all virtues have their Times, places,
persons, with other Circumstances, to be considered in their practices, without
which they are not esteemed ver^ues amongst Philosophers. This made some
Philosophers think Prudence the only virtue, varyed according to the diversity
of the objects, it was busied about, because that consider's these
Circumstances; others make it the chief, having an Interest in the acts of
every other virtue; so that he was utterly mistaken, in that expression; nor
are all virtues only by Philosophers assigned, to moderate passions, but
actions, as Aristotle discourses; as is apparent in that Cardinal virtue of
Justice. To conclude, a virtuous man make's passions Servants to Reason, and
governe's them, a vicious man let us them be his Masters which hinder's him from
true felicity. I have done with this, and had not touched upon it, but, through
this weak discourse, Mr. Hobbes thought to have obtruded upon an heedlesse
Reader, or such as is not versed in Moral Philosophy, a Contempt of so much
excellent doctrine, delivered by so many learned men; and to have (unjustly)
usurped the name of the only excellent Philosopher, which I (who acknowledge
my self a Novice to the others) ought not to subscribe to.

CENSURES UPON THE Sixteenth Chapter of Leviathan. ENTITLED, Of Persons,
Authors, and Things personated.
CHAP. XXX.
A Person what, and what to personate. Boethius's definition explained and
asserted. Of keeping and breaking Covenants. The true God personated neither by
Moses, nor any else. The Israelites, whose people.

Sect. 1.
THIS Chapter I should wholly have let pass, but that, by a few weak
Grammatical Notes, the plot of it seeme's to be aimed at most profane and
wicked purposes: for that reason I must censure it, as not befitting a
Christian Writer, and in its self containing many dangerous falsities; he
begin's it thus:

Mr. Hobbes's definition of a Person too circumstantial.
[ A person is he, whose words or actions are considered, either as his own, or
as representing the words or actions of another man, or any other thing, to
whom they are attributed, whether truly or by fiction.] Reader, here is a
strange Definition; Definitions should be short, without unnecessary
Circumstances, of which this is composed: I will make it shorter for him, in
his own sense; A person is he who does or speake's any thing; and this is as
full as his; for whosoever does or speake's, his words or deeds are considered
either as his own, or another; or he might have said, it is a particular man,
for actions or speeches of every particular man are either considered as his
own, or representing another man, or thing; so that his tedious description
might, without such circumstances, have been cut shorter, and have had the full
expression of his intendment. But because Mr. Hobbes will speak pertinently,
and be clearly understood what he meane's, he proceede's with a distinction.

Sect. 2.
[ When they are considered as his own (that is, those actions or words) then
is he called a Natural Person: and when they are considered as representing the
words and actions of another, then is he a feigned or artificial person.] Thus
may a man be distinguished into a true and counterfeit man; No less applicable
to a feigned than a true person.
and no more than the picture or the image of a man is a true man, no more is a
feigned or artificial person, a true person; and yet this feigned or artificial
person does as fully agree to his definition, as the true person; which shewe's
the Definition to be to blame: The Metaphysicians have an undoubted Axiom, that
ens and verum convertuntur; what is not truly such, is not such. If then such a
man, whom he name's, be but a feigned person, he is not a person truly, and
then not a person; yet we shall find him endeavoring to set him out, as the
only true person, presently afterward with his Grammar Rules.

Sect. 3.
[ The word person (says he) is Latin. Person not Latin.
] Sir persona is Latin, person is English; if he had said, person had been
derived from the Latin, it had been Truth; but to say, person is Latin, is
false; persona in no case is person, (...).
[ instead whereof the Greeks have (...),] it is true they have, and those two
in Greek and Latin are, by the use of speaking, most strictly in these two
Languages appropriated, to signify this which we call person in English; there
were other words often used to the same purpose. The Grecians used (...), and
the Latins Suppositum, (...). Suppositum.
which in time (for words, -- juvenum ritu florent modo n^ta vigentque) grew
out of esteem, and now signify other subsisting substances, and those two
former have gained, in the language of Divines, the expression of that which we
in English call person; and there was reason for it, because the latter have
been frequently used, by Divines and Philosophers in ancient times, for other
things besides persons; and so now, to avoid equivocations or tedious
Descriptions, both Divines and Philosophers speak both of suppositum and
hypostasis, in a general nature, as belonging to all other substances; but
persona and (...), as peculiar to reasonable substances, so that (...) is a
reasonable (...), and persona a reasonable suppositum. He goe's on with [ which
((...),) signifie's the face, as persona in Latin signifie's the disguise.
Person differently used in several arts and faculties.
] This is true, consented unto by all Grammarians; but use of words in diverse
matters, and diverse arts, is diverse: First in the Art of Grammar, we find but
three persons, I, thou, and he. Secondly, in Civil Law, we sometimes find it
the quality of a man, as rich, or poor; In Canon Law a Dignity, Bishop called
person, etc. in Metaphysics and Divinity, a reasonable subsistence; which is
totally neglected by Mr. Hobbes, as some other acceptations: so that, when he
had so debated, in such a large Discourse, upon the sense of the word, he was
to blame, in dwelling only among the Players, to have omitted the use of this
Word in so many Sciences. Consider the result of this horrid Criticism.

Sect. 4.
[ So (says he) that a Person is the same that an Actor is, both on the Stage
and in common Conversation; and, Misplaced by Mr. Hobbes.
to personate, is to act or represent himself or another:] This is it I
foretold you of, that although a feigned thing cannot be a true thing, yet he
make's the feigned only the true, and the representor only to be the true
person, not to be, who is represented; and although in his Definition he said,
That [ a Person is he whose words or actions are considered as his own, etc.]
and in his following division there was a natural and a feigned person; yet
here he make's all persons feigned, and their words and actions to be others:
If he answer, that his words were [ represent himself or another] then if he
act himself, it is enough to constitute him a person. No man personate's
himself.
] I reply, that what it is to act himself, he has expressed in the words
immediately preceding, [ a Person is the same that an Actor is, both on the
Stage and in common conversation:] Now no man can properly be said to act
himself, or represent himself; for the Actor and the acted, the Representor and
the represented, are two. He proceed's, [ and he that acts another is said
to bear his Person, or act in his name:] very true, but if he beare's another's
person, the other is the person, not he that beare's it: The Constable beare's,
represent's the person of a King, but is not his person; so does a Player; this
make's all against himself, and so does that which followe's, [ In which sense
Cicero uses it, where he says, Cicero mis-interpreted.
Unus sustineo tres personas; Mei, Adversarii, and Judicis: I bear three
persons; Mine own, my Adversaries, and the Judges:] and it is likely he might
say so truly, but he does not say, I am three persons, but I bear three, or act
them; they were the persons, whose parts he acted, at that time; not he who
acted them; the persons which he bare, and he who bare them, are diverse; thus
he overthrowes himself, when he labor's to show, that the Representor is the
person; but his Argument prove's only the represented to be the person; and
this we shall find in the ancient Tragedyes and Comedyes put out. Person how
taken by the Critics.
The Critic, which put^s them out, calle's the persons those which were
represented, not the Actors, as is to be seen in Seneca and Terence, etc. not
that I deny, this word has sometimes been used by Writers, as Mr. Hobbes
expresses it: but I deny that that is the universal acception of that word; or
that Mr. Hobbes his Argument does show, that it was ever so accepted: but
rather clean contrary; the person is he who is represented, not the
Representor. But now it will become me to show the right use of the word, and
how it may and must be used otherwise than Mr. Hobbes direct's.

Sect. 5.
Boethius's definition of a person.
A person then, taken in the most received conceit, that Divines and
Philosophers acknowledge, is defined by Boethius, de duabus naturis, to be
rationalis naturae individua substantia: An individual substance of a rational
nature: This Definition is most generally received, and I doubt not, but it
will abide the Test, when it is clearly explained, which I shall endeavor to
do; only Richardus de Sancto Victore gave it a rub, Rich. de Sancto V^ctore,
object's against it.
and make's men pause a while to explain it; for he, in his fourth book de
Trinitate, cap. 21. object's against this, that it is too large, because it
agree's to that which is not a Person, as the Divine Essence; for, says he,
this Divine Essence is the Trinity, which is not one Person. In ^is 24 cap. he
give's another Definition: Persona est per se existens, His other Definition of
it.
solum juxta singularem quendam rationalis existentiae modum: A person is a
thing existing by its self only, according to a single manner of a reasonable
existence: if he had expounded, More d^fficult.
what this singular manner of a reasonable existence is, by which we might have
discerned how the manner of existing had been diverse from others, he had acted
somewhat that we might have understood his meaning; but, as it is, will be very
hard: and this learned man (I see) but little followed; only his Countryman
Scotus in 1 mum senten. distinc. 23. quaest. unica, Scotus's Objections against
the former.
with his Sect make other Objections against this Definition, because (says
he) by this Definition, the Soul of man, separated from the body, should be a
person, for it agree's to that Soul; but that the Soul separated is a person,
is denied by him, as indeed by most, although affirmed by some very learned, as
the Master of the Sentences himself, and others: again, says Scotus, by this
Definition, there would be no Person in God, because individuale cannot be
where is no Dividuum, a dividible thing, which cannot be affirmed of God.
Again, this phrase, rationalis naturae, only agree's to man, not to God, or
Angels, whose knowledge is after a more excellent way, than by ratiocination
and discourse. These are the main Objections of Scotus, and his followers,
which I would answer immediately in their order, but that I think the bare
explication of Boethius his Definition will do it, without more business,
which thus I do.

Sect. 6.
The Definition explained and vindicated by the Bishop.
First a person is a substance; by that Term it is opposed to all accidents, and
things only imaginary; it is an individual substance, by that Term it is
opposed to those are called second substances, the general or sp^cial natures
of substances, which are dividual into many of the same nature, as a Man, a
Lion; there are many of the same kind under each of these notions, but there
are no more the same as one person; yet if perhaps that Term of Richardus de
Sancto Victore might seem more fully expressing this business, The Distinction
of Communicable ut quod and ut qu^.
which is (it is incommunicable) he may use it, and by that may be denied, that
the Soul of man separated is a person; because, although it is incommunicable,
ut quod (as the Scotists speak) yet it is not absolutely, for it is
communicable ut quo; which distinction may be thus explained; that thing is
communicable ut quod, which communicate's its self wholly, and in recto, as
they speak, so that it communicate's in such a manner, as a man can say another
is this; so do general or special, any universal natures, as we can say,
Socrates is a man, a sensitive thing, and the like: but there are other things
communicate themselves ut quo, when by them a thing receive's an addition of
some nature, yet not such, as that we may say another thing is this, but that
it has this, or is made such, or such, by it: so whiteness, heat, coldness, or
any form, the Soul of man, the form of any thing, these communicate themselves
ut quo, by which that thing, to which they are communicated, may be said to be
white, or have whiteness; to be hot, or have heat; not to be whiteness or heat;
to be animated or have a Soul; but not to be that soul, and the like: thus they
say that the Soul of man, separated, is communicable ut quo, though
incommunicable ut quod; it has in its self an aptitude to inform the body
again, though it be now separated; but, a person is absolutely incommunicable.
The last Term in this Definition is, Reasonable, of what extent.
that it is rationalis, of a reasonable nature: this word reasonable, must be
understood, of any intellectual nature, whether by discourse or else, and so it
comprehend's all, Divine, Angelical, or whatsoever; and, if I am not deceived,
this mere exposition will satisfy all the Objections which have been made:
that of Richardus who says, this agree's to the Divine Nature, which is the
Trinity: No, says my Definition, that Divine Nature is Dividual; communicable,
to three persons; Scotus his first Argument, that it agree's with a Soul
separated: No, say I, that is communicable ut quo. His second, which says,
that individuum must be of that is divisible: I think, I might deny that
Proposition; howsoever to that which followe's, that God cannot be divided, I
say, not into Beings or Natures; but, he is into Persons, and that without all
Composition. His third, that this phrase Rational cannot be understood of God,
is true in a gross sense, as no words we use, can, yet reason may, be affirmed
of God in a superexcellent manner, which excell's our knowledge or Discourse;
and Angels, although they discourse not, as most think; yet they have an
Angelical reason, which discern's, in a finer manner, those things without
Discourse, which we do by Discourse; nor is it necessary, The Philosophers and
Schoolmen could have r^ctified Mr, H^bbes's mistake of a person.
that rationality should be bound up only in the notion of Discourse, but may
well be extended to all manner of knowledge, beyond beasts. Thus you may
discern, what a person is esteemed to be, amongst such as know how to define;
and Mr. Hobbes, if his hatred to the School and common Philosophy be not such
as will not suffer him to read their Books, might easily have discovered this
amongst them, and have not suffered himself to be transported with the
imagination of how this word is used upon the Stage; only (for which Valla and
some such are called Pedagogues and Players, The Etymology and common
a^ception of Persona.
rather than Philosophers) in words, we are not always to consider their
Etymology, but how they are used; yet if we should go to the Etymology of
this word, the most commonly received amongst the Schools is significant of the
true use, which is per se una, a person, because it is by its self one; nor are
we to consider only how words have been used, but how they are now in our
English; formerly a Knave signified a servant, now a dishonest man; Bawdery
signified only bravery, now obscenity, with hundreds of the same nature: So
that since the Exposition, which I have given of this word Person, is that
which you shall find always to be the meaning of it when it is used amongst
Philosophers, when he give's another sense of it, he ought to have showed more
reason for it, then he has. But he has a Design in it: I will therefore
consider that.

Sest. 7.
Page 81. about the top of the leaf he says [ Of persons artificial some have
their words and actions owned by those whom they represent; and then the Person
is the Actor; and he that owneth his words or actions, is the Author] I am of
another mind, Not the Actor, but the acted is the person.
not the Actor, but the acted is the person, as will appear manifestly: A
Constable has his actions, and his words, legally spoke in the King's name,
owned as the King's; yet he is not the person of the King, but the King, in his
own person, act's by him; he beare's the person, represent's the person of the
King: but the King is the person, he the Actor or Representer: the Author,
according to his phrase, is the person, not the actor. I commend his
observations, upon Authority, and what followe's in that page, only I can by
no means approve what he says, in the middle of that page.

Sect. 8.
When the actor does any thing against the law of Nature by command of the
Author, if he be obliged by former Covenant to obey him, not he, but the Author
breaks the Law of Nature.] This is very erroneous, No Covenant obliging to
act against the Law of Nature
or else it make's an impossible supposition, for this supposition [ if he be
obliged by a former Covenant] must either be understood, that some former
Covenant had power to bind him to do this act against the Law of Nature, and
that is impossible: for no Authority, but that of the God of nature, can have
right to cross the Law of Nature; and then it is most consonant to the Law of
Nature, to obey him contrary to all Covenants, made to any other, by any
authority, yea even of God himself; and upon this ground the obedience of
Abraham to sacrifice his only Son (which was as cross to Nature as any thing
could be) was most honorable; or else must be understood, that some Covenant,
With whomsoever any such is made, it must not be kept.
of one man to another, of general obedience, in all things should have power
to oblige him to break the Law of Nature, upon such a man's command; and then
it is most wicked; First, it is sinful to make such a Covenant; and it is
doubly wicked, to keep it: for when a man make's such a bargain, it is
supposed to be in licitis et honestis, in lawful and honest things, not
against the Law of Nature; yea, should a man, in express terms, Covenant or
bargain, in particular, to do this individual thing which is unlawful, he
were bound to repent, and not to do it: his reason, he give's for the
Conclusion, is not strong enough to enforce it, which is.

Sect. 9.
For though the Action be against the Law of Nature; yet it is not his: but
contrarily, to refuse to do it, is against the Law of Nature, that forbids
breach of Covenant] This answer consist's of two parts, The first part of Mr.
Hobbes's answer destroye's the second*
I shall examine them distinctly: First he says [ it is not his] that is, his
that does it; he put's these relative terms very doubtfully; to this I reply,
if it be not his, he is not responsible for not doing of it: for no m^n can be
responsible for that which belong's not to him, for any act, but what is his
own; that which he has not power and Authority to do, his doing is not
virtuous, nor his not doing viticus; so that the first part of his answer
destroye's the second, which make's the Law of Nature to act against the Law of
Nature, when he has covenanted to do it; but certainly those actions are the
actors own acts, and he shall answer for them, be blessed or cursed for them;
God to be obey^d before man.
and because a man owe's obedience to God only, and to men, only for God's
sake, therefore whatsoever any man shall command, contrary to Gods Law written
in the Bible, or the nature of man, is a sin against God: and disobedience to
men commanding against the Law of God, is true obedience with God. An instance
in the Hebrew Midwives.
See one Instance in the first of Exodus, begin the Story, at the fifteenth
verse you shall find Pharaoh commanding the Hebrew Midwives, that they should
destroy ^he Male Children of the Hebrews: it is said in the 17 verse, the
Midwives feared God and did not as the King of Egypt commanded, and in the 21.
verse it is said, because the Midwives feared God, that God made them houses,
that is, blessed them: here it is evident, that when a Command was given, to
act that horrid sin of murder, which is against the Law of Nature, God blessed
those persons who feared God more then men, and would not be actors in that
which was against the Law of Nature, to destroy innocent Children: nor can Mr.
Hobbes have any evasion, to say, Who probably had covenanted.
they had not covenanted to do this act, for it is exceeding probable that
when Pharaoh commanded them to do it, he would not have dismissed them without
a promise; as it is reasonable to think, when he convented them, and charged
them with their fault, they would have excused themselves with saying, they did
not promise; but besides this Mr. Hobbes a little after this (which I intend to
treat) teaches, that every Subject make's a Covenant with Leviathan, to own
his actions and obey him; now then although there were no other Covenant, these
Midwives living under that Government, where Leviathan Pharaoh commanded it,
they had covenanted to obey him, yet God blessed them, because they did not; So
that, it seeme's their actions were their own, for which God blessed them,
though contrary to the command of Pharaoh.

Sect. 10.
The second part of his answer is this [ But contrarily to refuse to do it
(that is, what is commanded.) is against the Law of Nature that forbids
breach of Covenant] It is true, that the breach of Covenant considered, in its
self, is against the Law of Nature; for a man by Covenant give's away his
liberty of using, No breach of Covenant which had not a right to bi^d.
or acting that thing for which he covenanted, otherwise then by his Covenant:
but consider now, if a man, that has alienated away formerly his right to an
estate, or had no right to it, should make a deed of that estate to another
man, such an act could be of no benefit to that other: This is that man's case
who shall Covenant to act against the Law of God, written in books or hearts;
he cannot covenant to do it, it is void ipso facto, it is God's due, and he
cannot alien it, and what he shall act, according to such a Covenant, is
wicked, the very pretense to have power to do it, is a Conspiracy against God
and his right of Dominion over us: so that there can be no breach of such a
Covenant, which had no right to tie or bind any man; that Conclusion therefore
was a great mistake of Mr. Hobbes, and is justly censured here, because
conducing to other ill Consequences hereafter.

Sect. 11.
In the 82. page, having discoursed of many things which may and may not be
personated, toward the midst of that page, he says that [ the true God may be
personated] This phrase gave me an amazement: for I cannot call to mind any
such expression made either in Scripture, The true God improperly and
over-boldly said to be personated.
or Orthodox ecclesiastical writers, and, understanding personating in that
sense that Mr. Hobbes does, to say, the Actor is the person, it was too boldly
affirmed by him (I think) without any ground; had he spoke of the true God, as
he did before of Idols, to say, man might be trusted for those Gods, in things
which are dedicated to pious uses, and so, in the place of God, receive and
dispose such Legacies, and, in that sense, say, they personate God, quoad haec;
thus far there might have been some excuse; but to say, that the true God may
be personated by any thing which is not God, was too great an exaltation of the
Creature, and diminution of his excellency; but yet thus he does, as appears
by his Instance [ as he was; first by Moses, who governed the Israelites (that
were not his, but Gods people) not in his own name with hoc dicit Moses, but in
Gods name with hoc dicit Dominus] first by Moses. I am persuaded, Moses, though
instead of God, did not personate him.
he can never show me, that the true God was ever personated by Moses, A man
may be instead of God, in diverse Offices; to the poor are in the room of God,
instead of his hands, receive in God's stead those Alms which, for Gods sake,
are given them; Kings, Nor do Kings.
and those which are in Authority, are in God's stead, to govern and rule us,
and therefore we make conscience of obedience to them, because for this purpose
they are ordained of God: Priests are loco Dei, in the place of God, in Sacris,
holy Duties; Nor Priests.
so that they open or shut the gates of heaven, absolve and bind m^n, and he
that despises them, in those holy dispensations, despises Christ himself;
but, none of these can be said to personate God, nor can any Creature do it;
he who personate's God, must represent an infinite Excellency, infinite in
Power, infinite in Wisdom, etc. yea must represent an unspeakable, an
incommunicable, unexpressible, an unrepresentable excellency, which is
impossible: If Mr. Hobbes had said, that some men, as Moses, were Messengers
of God, as the Apostles; Ambassadors of God, to deliver or act his will amongst
us, he had said aright; but to make them personate him, sound's too high for a
finite Creature in his sense.

Sect. 12.
I know Exodus 4.36. it is said by God to Moses, That Aaron should be his
Spokes-man to the people; he should be to him instead of a mouth; and Moses
should be to him instead of God. And again, Exodus 7.1. See I have made thee a
God to Pharaoh, and Aaron thy Brother shall be thy Prophet. By the
understanding these two places, I think may be cleared whatsoever can be said,
How Moses was instead of God to Aaron.
for Moses his personating God; for that which concern's h^s being a God to
Aaron, we may observe, that he could be no otherwise a God to Aaron, then Aaron
was a Mouth to Moses; the same words are used to both: How was he a mouth, but
by speaking, and delivering those things which Moses directed? the same way was
he a God to Aaron, by directing Aaron, such things as God directed: so as the
people need not doubt, but what Aaron spoke was by the Direction of Moses; so
Aaron need not doubt, but what Moses appointed him to do, or speak, was the
will of God; and it is remarkable, that in both these places, the word used for
God is ELOHIM, ELOHIM.
which is a name given often to Kings and Princes, to men in Authority, so in
particular; not to multiply the places, in the 22 of Exodus, 28. Thou shall not
revile the Gods, that is the Princes, so thou shall be to him as God, or a
Prince; howsoever, the place enforces no more, but that Moses should be so a
God, as Aaron was his mouth, that was, to deliver his will; this is not to
personate or represent him as a person. The second place is as clear, How
Moses was made a God to Pharaoh.
where Moses is said in the 7 Chap. 1. to be made a God to Pharaoh. The story
is thus; Moses had something of man in him, and was afraid to go to Pharaoh:
be not afraid of him, says God to him, as he is above thee without me, so thou
shall be above him with me; I can rule him, thou shall be a God to him: thou
shall terrify him with signs and wonders, and Aaron thy brother shall be thy
Prophet, that is, deliver thy words, as it is expounded in the following verse;
or else we may take Elohim, in the other sense, for a Prince or King; so, I
have made thee a King or Prince over Pharaoh, thou shall have power over him,
as he over his subjects; but, which way soever, he is but enabled by God, for
certain works; and we may take another observation; in neither of these
places, is he called God or a Representment of God, but God to Aaron, God to
Pharaoh, that is, to those particular persons, in those particular businesses:
but this come's not up close to Mr. Hobbes who says, the true God may be
personated; concerning which there is no such expression in these Texts: but
that Moses was made an Instrument of God's, to act some things toward these
two persons, Pharaoh and Aaron. Nay, I will add one note more, Ho^ fully
soever Moses had represented God, he could not personate him.
that from these Texts, had Moses represented God never so fully, yet could he
not be said to personate God, according to Mr. Hobbes his understanding a
person, for a person, by Mr. Hobbes, is such a man as is a Li^utenant, a
representer, an Attorney etc. according to all these phrases he expresses him
in the preceding page; but none of these could Moses be, because all those must
be notified that they are such to the parties with whom they negotiated; but
this certainly was only expressed to Moses, he was made acquainted with this
power, not Aaron, not Pharaoh; and therefore he was not made one of Mr. Hobbes
his persons: but if he were, which no where appears, yet, it is most evident,
not in that sense, which he express^th, that is, in respect of the people,
which is his expression [ who governed the people] now he is never said to be a
God to the people, which yet he might have been by the same word, which is used
in those places, signifiing a R^ler, or Prince: he adde's an unadvised
Parenthesis [ that were not his, but Gods People.]

Sect. 13.
They were God's by adopting them into a more peculiar favor then any other
nation in the world, The Israelites how the people of G^d, and how of M^ses.
guarding them with eminent Miracles of his providence; they were Moses his
people, by being under God the Dispenser of those acts of providence, and
therefore Exodus 32.7. God called them his people; Get thee down, for thy
people, which thou broughtest out of the Land of Egypt, have corrupted
themselves; and Moses repeating, in a long Discourse, the mercyes of Gods
providence toward them, rehearses the same words, Deuteronomy. 9.12. so that they
were the people of God, by his especial grace; and they were Moses his people,
by his being, under God, their Governor; the same act is attributed to the
first and supreme Cause, in a most high and eminent way; to the second, as an
Instrument, cooperating with it. In the 20 of Genesis, it is said, that God
brought them out of the Land of Egypt; in this place it is said, that Moses
brought them; both in their several ways, God, as the first, Moses as the
second Cause: but let us consider, perhaps he gives, a reason for what he
s^ith; he affirme's that Moses govern's the people, not in his own name, with
hoc dicit Moses: but in God's, with hoc dicit Dominus.

Sect. 14.
If this would serve to make him personate another, then he and I should
personate God; for when we urge Scripture, we say God, or the Spirit of God
says it; nay, Moses's phrase shewe's he personated not God.
I may say for Moses (whose humility was far from usu^ping that excellency
which Mr. Hobbes ascribe's unto him) if he had personated God, in Mr. Hobbe^
his sense, he would not have used that phrase, hoc dicit Dominus, but Ego hoc
dico; let a man consider a Player upon the Stage, when he personates and act's
a King, he does not say, the King says this, or the Lord, but I command, as if
he were a King; and this is, by Mr. Hobbes the original of this word person, to
which he applie's all.

Sect. 15.
One word more: I am of Opinion, as Mr. Hobbes in another place speake's
rightly (and others, God was King of the Israelites, Moses but their Judge and
General.
before him, say a much) that in the time of Moses, Josua, and the Judges, God
was the sole King of the Israelites; he gave them Laws; they by Covenant bound
themselves to obey those Laws; he to protect them; and Moses was so far from
being their King, that he gave them no Laws; so that he was but, as it were, a
Judge, and a General to lead them in their battails, as God directed, and to
judge their Causes according to God's Laws which he had given them; and we
shall find that Moses used that Authority but sparingly, for, he had recourse
to God still, in any weighty matter of that nature, and would not judge any
thing besides the letter of the Law: So you may find Leviticus 24.11, 12, 13,
14. that the Lord himself gave sentence upon him who had blasphemed his name;
he was in the 12. verse put in ward, that the mind of the Lord might be known,
in the 13. verse the Lord spoke un^o Moses, not his person, but his Officer,
bring forth, etc. verse 14. See likewise Numbers 15.35. The Lord declared to
Moses what should be done to the man who gathered sticks on the Sabbath day;
and the like you may find in the Case of Zelophehad Numbers 27. verse 1. and
Moses brought their cause before the Lord, verse 5. and verse 6. the Lord spoke
unto Moses saying, etc. so that Moses was so far from personating God, that he
did nothing but as a Messenger, A messenger and Mediator betwixt God and them
and Mediator betwixt God and them, delivering God's will to them, their
requests, and many times his own, for them, to God; and therefore though God
in 32. of Exodus, when he was angry with the abominations of the Israelites,
would disown them, and his peculiar interest in them; he, as it were, threw
them off to Moses, and called them his people; yet Moses pleading for them
verse 11. etc. returne's them to God again, and calle's them his people, which
he brought forth of the Land of Egypt; he owned none of those glorious works
to be his, of which he was but an Instrument, but attributed all to God. Well,
then we see Moses was but an instrument, a Judge, a General, and those Offices
in a weak manner performed, not without a perpetual direction from God; but
in nothing did he personate him; so that I think Mr. Hobbes was deceived in
using this unheard of phrase, concerning Moses; but I would he had rested in
this, and had gone no further; me thinke's, I could have forgiven this,
(although somewhat too bold a language) taking personating in a very large
sense, that Moses, and all Kings, might be said, in a little weak manner, to
personate God (although I did distaste it) but what followe's is worse.

CHAP. XXXI.
Christ personated not God, being really God himself. His Divinity asserted

Sect. 1.
[ SEcondly, by the Son of man, his own Son, our Savior Jesus Christ] I will
stop here, Uncomely to say, our Savior personated God.
and leave the intent of our Savior's coming, to another place; he make's here
our Savior to personate God, he call's him truly the Son of man, and the Son
of God; but in saying, he personated God, he used a phrase no whit comely to
express such a sacred Mystery by; no man can properly be said to personate
another, who is that other; now this son of man is the son of God, and he is
God, and thought it no robbery to be equal with God; if he be God, he cannot
be said, in any propriety of speech, to personate God; for he, who personate's
another, is not really that other, but counterfeitly only; Now our blessed
Savior is really God, which he would have him personate, Who was really God.
and therefore cannot personate God. This truth, not long since, had had no
need to have been spoken of, amongst Christians; whosoever, heretofore,
professed the name of Christ, did readily assent to it; but of late it has
been denied by many, in Polonia, and the infection has come into our nation,
and that infection has Antidotes prepared for it, which are able to remove it
from the heart of those who would cordially apply it to them; so that there
need no more to be said to it; yet because they, who read this little treatise,
may perhaps not have opportunity, or leisure, to look upon other writers, I
shall add a word or two to satisfy the Reader concerning this business, and
show, that Mr. Hobbes has very unhandsomely expressed himself in it, and
de^ogatorily from the eternal deity of our most blessed Savior; and first in
saying [he does personate God,] for although he say, he is the Son of God,
his own Son, which in its self were enough to satisfy a Reader, that he must be
of the same nature with his father (for every Son is such) yet, since the
waywardness of men has studied so many foolish distinctions, to beguile the
simple, amongst which that is one of a natural and adopted Son, of an
eternally, and a temporary begotten Son; to which sense are expounded, that
Christ is his Son, but an adopted; Christ is his own, but a Temporary begotten
Son, either when the holy Ghost overshadowed the blessed Virgin, as soon, or
before the world was made, as others; ^his phrase of his cannot shelter him
from many peevish and perverse doctrines, when he make's him not to be, but to
personate God: I shall first show that he is God, and then, how it is not
incongruous to reason to say it, laboring in all to make my Reason ascend up
to my Faith, not my Faith descend to my Reason; cross to which I have thought
(since first I was acqu^inted with their writings) that the Socinians first
laid a plot for Religion by Reason, then labored to wrest Scriptures to that
plot.

Sect. 2.
P^^ved to be (...), from Acts 20.17, and 28.
In proving our blessed Savior to be God, I shall not use many places of
Scripture, one or two will be enough, so they be clear and evident; the first
shall be Acts 20. where you shall find that St. Paul verse 17. did at Miletum
s^nd to Ephesus, for the elders of the Church which were there; and verse 28.
he gave them a charge in these words: Take heed therefore to your selves and to
all the flock over which the holy Ghost has made you overseeers, to feed the
Church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood. I observe that the
Church is called the Church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood;
this Article ( he) can relate to none but God, he therefore, who has purchas^d
this Church with his blood, is God: I will spare nothing that I find brought by
any in the way of answer, but do hope this place will vindicate its self,
and this cause very clearly. Against Bernard. Ochinus*
First then Bernardinus Ochinus in his second book of his Dialogues, Dialogue
19. but the first of that book page 100. in mine edition, bring's this place
and answeares it thus: First, that [ this is not spoke of the blood of God, but
of Christ, of whom a little before Saint Paul spake] but this is so fa^re from
all reason, as nothing can be more; for the Apostle did not name ou^ Savior
nearer then four verses before, in the 24. verse which could abide no
construction to this; and here, in this period of Scripture, which is entire in
its self ( the Church of God which he has purchased with his blood) is no one
word which can receive this person, he, but God; that therefore was mighty
vain. He adde's another answer, that is, that [ God may be said to have
acquired this Church with his blood, that is, with the blood of Christ, who was
his, and whose blood was shed by his will] this answer of his when Smiglecius
had overthrown with that reply, that, Refuted by Smigl^cius.
[ by the same reason the blood of Bullockes and Calves might be called the
blood of God which were shed by the will of God] which Argument is of force
against that exception o^ Ochinus; for if it were therefore called Gods blood
because shed by his will, then all blood, that is shed by his will, may be
called the blood of God; for where is the reason of any thing, there that thing
is also; Therefore Valentinus Smalcius, a great Socinian, To whom Sm^lcius
replies having either not read or not aright understood Ochinus.
in his answer to Smiglecius, de divina verbi incarnatione, Cap. 24. although
he will not undertake to defend Ochinus, and indeed seeme's not to have read
him (although he might as well have owned the Title of these Opinions, as
Socinus) yet he endeavour's to refute Smiglecius thus; [ For (says he) Ochinus
may say, that he did no^ say, that Christ's blood was called God's, only
because it was shed by the will of God, but for the redemption of us, by the
will of God, which the blood of Bullocks and Calves could not be said to do;]
thus he; bu^, first, he was mistaken in Ochinus, for he writ nothing but the
words I have set down, and therefore could not say, he said so, whatsoever he
meant. Secondly, if he had said so, as it seeme's Smalcius does, it had not
been material, for which way could the offering that blood, for our redemption,
appropriate it to God? it might by that reason have been called our blood,
because offered for us; but there is no Color why the offering for us should
entitle God to it, by any particular interest. But Ochinus give's a third
answer [ I can also say, (says he) that Christ was God by participation, and
that in a more excellent manner, then any other of the Elect] This answer of
his I find deserted by all the Socinians, O^hinus deser^^d by the Socinians.
who allow Christ to be God, but not the great God the Creator, but a man
deified, and a God by office, for which those qualifications enabled him; but
here the Church, which they were to feed, being acknowledged to be the Church
of the great God, they must not fly to a God by participation, but get some
other shift. Valentinus Smalcius, where before, Smalcius attempt's in vain to
evacuate the divinity of Christ.
therefore bestowe's that Chap. to expound this place, so as the Divinity of
Christ may be avoided; first then he says that [ it is agreed on, who is meant
by God in this text, we, the true and chief God, he and his part, the father,
because he only is the true and chief God] thus far he speake's true, of
both our opinions; but now he is mistaken, when he says [ we agree both, that
God the father may be said to have acquired his Church with his blood, only by
a figurative speech] first he is mistaken in this, when he says, that
Smiglecius (against whom he write's) should say, that God the father acquired
this Church with his blood; for although it were true, that God, who was the
father, yet not in the person of the Father, but of the Son, they being both
one and the same God. Secondly, he is mistaken in saying, that this was
figuratively understood, when indeed it is, as the Text speake's most properly,
affirmed of the Son, in whose person the humanity of Christ was taken: that it
was acquired or purchased with his own proper blood. He goe's on, because
(says he) the whole blood of Christ was, by a singular reason, God's; as
Christ himself is called the lamb of God, so the blood of this Lamb may be
called rightly the blood of God; and although this manner of speech is not
familiar and common in the Scriptures; yet is it not absurd or false] I reply:
this manner of speaking is not only unusual, but not found in Scripture, nor
(I think) in any other Author of reputation, and is absurd and false; for,
certainly, that manner of speaking is absurd and false, which expresses
another thing then what was intended, which this must, if it should mean by
the blood of God, the blood of one who was not God, although belonging to God,
and, as I may spe^k^, Gods, and not Gods; resemble the case in any other thing;
I have a Dog (and, because I will make the instance without exception) I set
this Dog at a Sheep; the Dog with his Teeth kill's this Sheep; I may truly say,
my Dog killed this Sheep; nay, I can say, because I was the Author of it, that
I killed the Sheep, but I cannot say I killed the Sheep with my Teeth, unl^sse
I had worried the Sheep with mine own Teeth, but I did it with my Dog's, for
although the Dog was mine, and his Teeth were mine out of the same interest;
yet they were not mine, but my Dog's Teeth; so in all Sacrifices, the beast
which was Sacrificed was his beast, for whom it was offered; and the blood was
his, as a part of that beast; but yet neither was it in its self, nor was it
ever called the man's blood, but the Calve's the Goate's, etc. nor should any
man hear these words, purchased by a man's blood, but he would conceive, that
that man spilt his blood for that thing; the reason of that is, that whatsoever
is a part of another, whether essential, as soul and body, form and matter;
or integrall, as eye, hand, foot, root, branch, or the like, these have all of
them a relation to their whole in themselves and in the usage of their names,
and therefore these applications of them cannot be made to any other but their
own correlative, without some addition to expound it, as thus; my servant is
mine, his Soul and body, bound to serve me; yet, when ^e dye's, I cannot say,
my Soul left me, for this word Soul intimate's a relation to that body which it
animated or ensouled (as I may speak) nor, what that Soul desi^e's, or hate's,
that my Soul desire's or hate's, or the like. So when my horse is blind, I
cannot say, that my eyes have lost their sight, because this phrase, mine eyes,
relate's to mine own body, of which they are an integrall part, and this other
not so; the same may be said of my blood; and therefore this learned man,
seeing his answer weak, out of the usage of speeches (although perhaps he did
not discern the reason) ^all's into passion, and crye's out, [ It is better to
use this figurative manner of speech, most easy to understand, then to
introduce a thing not only absurd, but blasphemous, unto Christian religion,
to say, that that one and chief God should have blood, etc.] I forgive his
passion, but grieve, to see so much zeal, if not fury, bestowed upon so ill a
Cause; for we do not say, that God had blood, as God, but as manhood was united
to the divinity in the same person; that he, taking our nature, had it with all
its Conditions, body and blood. I shall insist no farther upon this at this
time.

Sect. 3.
Valentinus Smalcius urges out of Smiglecius a little further [ this language
is unheard of in Scripture, Christ^s blood not to be called the blood of the
Father, according to Smiglecius.
that Christ's blood should be called the blood of the Father, or that we
should be redeemed by the blood of God the Father, nay, if at any time our
redemption be attributed to God the Father, then it is added, by Christ, or by
his blood, but not by the blood of God the Father,] thus far Smiglecius; now
let us observe Smalcius his answer, Smalcius that argue's how it may.
thus [ this argue's only that the Language is unusual and rare, not that it
is impossible and false; that which is rare and unusual may be most true, if
it agree with the Analogy of Christian Religion, and may be excused (which,
says he, I have done above) neither does any thing hinde^, but that that which
is commonly properly used, that God by Christ, and his blood, acquired us, may,
in one place, be improperly used that God the Father has acquired us by his
own blood] First, that which he affirme's, he has done above, I conceive to
be no more then that refuted exception he made to Smiglecius, that these
Speeches might be affirmed of God, by reason that Christ was the Lamb of God,
and therefore his blood, God's blood; or else what he spoke in the preceding
Chapter, that it must be understood metaphorically, as Zachary 2.8. he, that
touches you, touches the Apple of mine eye; as likewise Math. 25.45. where
our Savior says, in that ye did, or did not, these things to his little ones,
ye did, or not did, them to him; the meaning is, His argument urged to the
farthest by the Bishop.
that as God hold's his servan^s so dear to him, that he esteeme's the
demeanor used to them as done to himself; so these actions done by his dear
ones (in which rank Christ was the chief) may be said to be done by him; when
Christ shed his blood, then God the Father may be s^id to shed his, because
done by one Dear, like himself, to him. I have pressed this Argument to the
height, and indeed farther then he has; and now consider how I shall acquit my
self of it, which will be thus; I do not, nor do I think others can, Who
finde's the passions* not the actions of men to be called God's.
find the actions of men, called Gods actions, although the passions are often;
as thus, in that you did it to those, you did it to me; and so he touches the
Apple of mine eye, of any one that touches his Servants; but actions not so,
Math. 18.18. as whatsoever ye shall bind on earth, shall be bound in haven:
here is a double act, on earth and in heaven; although God interested himself
as much in that act of man's, as may be, yet he call's it not his own, but
man's act; so likewise he expresses it John 20.23. Whose soever sins ye remit,
they are remitted; where is set down a twofold action or remission; now this
expression is of an action, which he has purchased with his blood; The
shifting Genius of the Socinians de -- luded by a single word.
and although there was never such a shifting Genius run through any sort of
men as these Socinians, to avoid the sense of Scripture; yet, methinke's, this
place is penned, as of purpose to delude their evasions; it has stopped all
their Mushes, and therefore it is put emphatically, with his own blood, (...),
this (...) intimates a peculiar propriety to that thing to which it is
applied, appropriating it to God, distinct from other things; The answer of
Smalcius is, that (...) signifies no more then suus, his own, and so it is
rendered by the vulgar latin, John 1.11. thus it is; but whether truth or no,
there is the question; our English renders it much better, He came unto his
own, and his own received him not; and although this word suus does not enforce
this more restrained and peculiar sense, yet it does not deny it, but many
times is used for it; and certainly, those in St. John were, in a most proper
expression, called his, his friends, his kindred, his Servants, what you please
of that kind: the same answer may pass to his second instance, which is taken
out of the 1 Cor. 6.18. he who commits fornication (...), (...) how to be
translated.
it is by the vulgar Latin translated suum, his body, but by our English much
better, his own body; nor indeed can the blood of Christ God, be more his
own, then a man's body is his own, and therefore, whatsoever Translators read,
it is evident, that this word (...) beare's the same sense every where; and it
is remarkable, that these writers, who abhor that vulgar translation in an
hundred places, should, in this, refuse the Original for it, upon no ground. He
give's another answer [ that the blood of Christ may be called the blood of
God, although it do not naturally flow from the Father (we do not say, it is
the blood of the Father, but of God) because, says he, chiefly by a miraculous
working of the Father, Christ had his blood] but can he show me where there is
any such example, or phrase, in Scripture? I believe not; but he goe's on with
an instance out of Socinus, [Things (says he) like blood, may be said to be
belonging to one, which notwithstanding are not his naturally] I can grant all
this, and it hurt's not this last phrase of being his properly, which his Text
enforces; but he instanceth 1 Cor. 6 20. (glorify God in your body, and in
your spirit, The text, which want's it, retorted upon the Socinians.
which are Gods) but here is not (...) the word enforcing the propriety; and
consider that the Apostle taught the Corinthians, in the beginning of that
verse, how to understand that language, that our Souls and bodies are God's;
for, (says he) you are bought with a price; because your Souls and bodies are
bought with a price, therefore they are his, his by purchase, yours by nature:
and this distinction in either part is put down evidently in the Text: Glorify
God in your Soul, and body both which are their own naturally, which yet are
his by redemption: nay I can urge this Text, emphatically, for the divinity of
Christ: for if he bought us and paid a price for us, then we are h^s, and he,
whose we are, is God, most express in the Text; him we must glorify whose we
are, that is, God Christ's we are by redemption, therefore Christ is God; thus
this Text, urged in one word, to avoid his divinity, proved by the former Text,
in the words taken together, does most clearly confirm it, and yet you see it
is not to the purpose, for this word (...) his own is not in the Text, but if
it were, yet it might be so used, because our body and Spirit are expressed to
be his by purchase, that is God-Christs; and in the Text, which I treat of,
the blood of Christ, whom he terme's God, is said to be the purchasing price:
so that then man's body and Spirit are God's, but his purchase; and that, which
they were purchased with, was the blood of God, Christ, his own blood in a most
peculiar and proper acception. That our blessed Savior was God then, appeare's
from this place of Scripture. This The^me has been handled by abundance; I
love not actum agere, my design shall be to examine those great and chief
names by which he is called in this relation.

Sect. 4.
The first is the Son of God, which Mr. Hobbes allowe's him to be, and
therefore I might be brief in it; but, How Christ is the son of God.
because that this Term, Son, is variously used by Writers, I will somewhat
insist upon that acceptance, which is most common, to explain what is
intended by it; there is an adopted, and there is a natural Son, a Son which is
indeed, and a Son taken into the room of him that is such a one, legally made
a Son: the one is a Son begot, the other is made such; the real truly begotten
Son is it, which we affirm of our Savior; he is such a Son of God; we are
adopted, made Sons. To know this we must first apprehend what a Son is: A Son
is an intellectual substance, What a son is.
produced naturally of the same nature with the producer; the general nature
is a Substance produced, but yet that very general Term distinguishes a Son
from a Father; for although amongst created things there is no Father which had
not a producer, yet, the notion of a father intimate's no such thing, and in
the holy and blessed Trinity, the Father has no producer nor origination from
any; the rest is the difference; first [ an intellectual substance] this
distinguishes it from the generation of beasts, plants, mettalls, fire, water,
or the like, which properly cannot be called Sons of their producers; but if
any one will desire that they be called Sons, I will not much contend, or
gainsay it; it will no whit hurt my design: The next Term is, ( produced
naturally) This put's a difference betwixt a Son and art facta, such things as
are made by art: (of the same nature with the producer) This is the last term,
and by this it is distinguished from all equivocal generations; and therefore a
Worm cannot be said to be the Son of the Sun; for although it be produced
naturally by the Sun, yet, it is of another nature, and by that reason is not
a Son.

Sect. 5.
The particulars in the definition apply^ed to our Savior.
Thus, the nature of a Son explained, let us examine how it may be applied to
our blessed Savior, the Son of God: first it is evident, and no man will deny,
that our Savior was an intellectual substance, and that he was produced; the
chief querie will be, upon these two last Clauses; whether produced naturally?
and whether of the same nature? and first that he was produced naturally, that
will appear out of this; that being produced by God the Father, as all agree,
he must be either a Creature, or else naturally produced; indeed, taking
naturally in a large sense, for whatsoever opposes viol^nce, a man may say,
that a Creature is produced naturally, by God, because that no violence can
force the om^ipotent to do any thing; and the Creatures have imprinted in
their very natures a passive obedience to God, by which they submit themselves
to his sacred will; but in this place we understand naturally, in a more strict
meaning, as it opposes, not only violence, but art facta, things made by
art; for those things, which are done by the nature of any thing, are done
primo et per se, not per accidens; of the nature, bent, and disposition of the
agent, not because of any accidental addition, which happen's to it: this is
principally discerned b^ the constancy of that action or motion, for when
things are accidental, they appear seldom, and, many times, are not such,
but things* or actions, that flow naturally from any, are so constantly, and,
when opportunities are offered, are always such: so it is accidental to me,
that I write at this time, I do not always do so, no, not when I am provoked
by reading, or studying an untruth, no, not this self same untruth which I
write against; but that I should eat meat at dinner, is a natural action, I
always do it, unless some accidental thing intervene, to hinder it, and
then, the not eating is accidental, but the eating were natural, because this
last arises out of the disposition and temper of my body; the former, not
eating, from some accidental distemper.

Sect. 6.
Now then, to show that our Savior's generation, The mystery of our Savior's
divine and humane generation signified Mic. 5.2.
according to his divinity, was such, I shall handle that one place Mic. 5.2.
But thou Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little amongst the thousands of
Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me, that is to be Ruler in
Israel, whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting.

My observations upon this Text are, The Bishop's observation on that Text.
first that it is spoke of our Savior, this is evident out of that Mat. 2.6.
where this Text is applied to him; And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,
art not the least amongst the Princes of Judah, for out of thee shall come a
Governor that shall rule my People Jsrael. So likewise John 7.42. Has not the
scripture sa^d, tha^ Christ comes of the s^ed of D^vid, and out of the Town of
Bethlehem, where David was? This is consented to ^y all; here then le^ us
consider, that that saying [ comes forth] is understood of his being borne at
Bethlehem; this likewise is unqu^stioned, for ought I find; then let us
meditate upon the last Clause, [ whose going forth have been from of old, from
everlasting;] there is no ^eason to think but that, as his coming forth, in the
precedent part of the verse, did signify h^s birth according to his humanity:
so this going forth from of old etc. should signify his birth according to his
divinity; for these cannot be understood of that birth which was at Bethlehem,
which the Prophet says, shall be, which was acted long time after the
Prophet's writing; but of something that was acted long before, which those
words enforce, from of old, and from everlasting. Faustus Socinus, in his
answer to Wic^us and Bellarmine Cap. 7. page 394. thus answers, hujus ipsius
rationis vi concludi non solum de vera nativita^e utrobique agi, s^d etiam de
eadem, etc. That the fo^ce of this reason does not only evince, that this is
m^ant of a true nativity, but the same nativity: (observe his reason): for
(says he) the latter words, by which he means [come forth] coming from the
same root, as the former, must signify the same thing, as they did in the
former.] Thus he: but let me answer him; Faustus Socinus answ^^'d.
that although it did not only proceed out of the same root, but were the very
self same word, and did signify the same act; yet, when the Tense is varyed,
it must needs signify a diverse effect or result of that act as thus; the fire
an hundred years hence shall warm a man; and the fire an hundred years ago
has warmed a man; here, though the warming be the same verb, and the object, a
man, the same, yet, the Tense being varyed, shall do it, and has done it, the
act must neede's be varyed.

This is just our Case: he shall be born in Bethlehem, says the Prophet; and
his birth was, or has been of old, etc. It is impossible, but that these must
be spoke of two particulars; but Valkelius in his fifth book de vera religione,
Cap. 12. page 473. give's an unnecessary stop here, saying, that [ egression,
or going forth is of a larger Scope, then Generation;] but besides that he
yield's to the understanding it of Generation, And Valkelius.
a little after he must be evinced out of the Text, for egression or coming
forth out of Bethlehem, was a nativity, therefore this must be so likewise;
again, if this egression, here do not, in its genuine Sense, signify
generation, yet it must needs suppose it, for nothing can go forth that is not;
it must be before it go forth; therefore either eternal, without being
generated; or else generated, before the motion or action of coming forth; both
which are alike opposite to these Divines; besides this, I may urge, that it is
a common phrase, in the language of Scripture, to say, that one, who is
generated by another, comes out of him; so Genesis 10.14. and Pathrusim and
Casluhim out of whom came Philistim, that is, they begat Philistim, so Genesis
17.6. I will make nations of thee, and Kings shall come out of thee, that is,
shall be generated by thee; in their degrees of their Generations, they shall
be thy Issue. This language is so frequent, I need not instance in it;
therefore although it were, and does often signify something else; yet, it
does often, in Scripture language, signify this emanation, by generation, and
for the reasons above must do so here; Socinus, where before quoted,
proceede's, and saye's, that [ because these two words, which signify the
coming forth, or going forth, are derived from the same root, therefore they
must signify the same birth; and therefore if Christ's birth were from eternity,
he must be borne in Bethlehem from eternity, but, says he, the Hebrew word
signifies only a Diebus secul^, from the days of old or time] I will not
trouble the English Reader with the Hebrew Criticisme, which is done by others,
and satisfactorily, that in this place it must be understood of eternity. To
the first Argument, from the root, I have answered already to that; where he
says, the Hebrew word signifies not eternity; I answer, for the present, that
I will not vex the English Reader with these unnecessary Hebrew Criticismes:
there are diverse have showed that it must be so understood in this place; his
two instances out of Isaiah 52.9, 11. and Malachi 3.4. are of no force; for the
first, he troubled me, because it was false printed, and truly urged by
Valkelius, Isaiah 55.9, 11. in a word I grant, that word may be used for
ancient times, or ages; but again, no Socinian can deny that it is used,
likewise, for eternity, or before time; howsoever, it is of force against them,
who hold our Savior had no being, before he was borne of the blessed Virgin;
and that he was not before, but long after the Prophet writ; but, says
Socinus, [it may be affirmed of his birth in Bethlehem, it was of old, or from
everlasting, as he would read it, ab initio and a diebus saeculi must be
understood thus, that he, who was to be a Governor, or Ruler in Israel, Suam
originem trahere ab initio, and a priscis diebus, id est, ab eo primo tempore,
cum Deus olim in suo populo regem stabilivit, and confirmavit; quod revera
caeptum est fieri in persona Davidis; that is, did draw his beginning, or
derive his pedigree from the beginning or ancient times, that is, from that
first time, when God heretofore established and confirmed his Kingdom, or his
people, which was begun to be done in the person of David.

To this purpose they speak all, Valkelius, Smalcius, etc. but although they
have the greatest art of shifting of Scripture that ever men had; With other
Socinians.
yet certainly it appeare's a miserable shift in this place; first, observe
here, that there is in this sentence, [ whose goings forth have been from of
old, from everlasting] no word which in any place of the Bible is pretended to
signify a Pedigree, or Series of Ancestors; if no where else, why should it be
so here then? nay; here is not any one word, that by any interpretation, or
wresting, can signify forefathers, which were before, but only the times in
which they lived; if they will read it their own way, which is ab initio and
priscis diebus, this can only intimate the time in which this egression was,
not the person from whom it was. Next, consider that if this emanation, this
egression, here, be understood of his birth in Bethlehem, that as Socinus
disputed, our Savior must be born there, when this was done in it, and yet he,
Smalcius, Valkelius, all agree, it does mean that egression, that Birth; but,
Smalcius in tertiam partem Smig. Cap. 26. Page 224. says, that [ Socinus does
not say, that Christ was born in these ancient times, but that he said, Sed cum
qui certo tempore nasci debuit ait ortum suum habere a progenitoribus
antiquissimis, which is that he who should be born at a certain time had his
original or rising from most ancient Progenitors,] I am sure Socinus does say,
that the word being derived from the same root, as I said before, must signify
the same which it did before] and from that deduced that absurdity, that [ if
this phrase should be from eternity, Christ was borne in Bethlehem from
eternity,] and that, which Smalcius speake's of, is a gross exposition, how
this phrase of being from the beginning and in ancient times, should be applied
to that birth of our Savior's at Bethlehem; but the unreasonablenesse of this
appeare's (besides my former reasons) in that there is not the least tending to
such an expression out of this, that such a phrase added no distinct knowledge
of this Ruler, which should be borne, more then was before; for every man had
his rise from most eminent Progenitors, yea, but this was one born in
Bethlehem; why all that were borne in Bethlehem must needs be so; yea, but this
was descended ab initio, that is, from David, who was the beginning of that
kingdom of Israel; so were many more, no doubt, who were borne in Bethlehem:
In my judgment, this Text is the most wretchedly tortured by them, that ever
any, when no one word in the Text ever else was used to that purpose; nor in
this use is a man taught any thing which was not full in the Text before, which
expressed his birth in Bethlehem.

Sect. 7.
The text taken in pieces and vindicated from their objections.
I will take every word apart, and vindicate it from their several Objections:
first this word egressus, whose goings forth, as our English; their explication
of this, is [ that he came forth by the generation of his forefather, in
particular of David,] I answer, that it is true, that a man may be said to come
forth of another, who was long time before in him, as in our usual language,
we express it, he descended from such Ancestors (I make their expression
clearer then I find it in any of their Authors by this explication,) Nay, we
can say, such a man's Son, when he shall be born, will be descended from an
ancient family, from Kings and great Persons; but to say, he has descended,
before he is, can abide no answerable construction; but this is our
consideration, the Text says of him, who shall be borne in Bethlehem, but yet
is not; that his goings forth have been from of old; now until a man is, he
cannot be said, to have his going forth from of old; a man may say it will be;
not that it has been; and therefore, without doubt, this Text, speaking of the
same person, which he said should be borne in Bethlehem [whose goings forth] we
must understand by it something of that person which was in those ancient
times, which can be nothing but our Savior's divinity; but they object against
this Phrase, that it is said goings forth, in the plural number; now according
to true doctrine, our Savior's divinity has but one emanation, or egression,
or going forth, therefore, say they, this cannot be understood of that
egression. That our Savior's Egression, according to his divinity, was but
one, will easily be granted by us; but it is excellently observed by
Hebricians, One in essence plurally expressed, when the effects are diverse.
that the holy Ghost is usually pleased to express that which is but one in
his essence, by a plural number, when the effests are diverse. So Prove. 1.20.
Wisdom (we read it] cries without, but in the Original it is in the plural
number, wisdoms; without doubt the Wisdom of God is one only, as he is one,
but the energies, the operations of this wisdom are many, in regard of which
it is called wisdoms in that holy language; so likewise concerning the mercy
of God Genesis 32.10. the least of thy mercies, when, without doubt, the mercy of
God is one, but the operations of mercy are diverse; multitudes of Instances
might be given to this purpose; and this is the Case of our Savior's divinity,
the emanation, the going forth of it is but one, the operations are diverse, and
in regard of them it is called goings forth. God's eternal purpose to make
man; to forgive him, for Jesus Christ's sake; to work man's redemption by him;
to judge the world at the last day by him; these are operations of the eternal
emanation of the Son of God; and because these are diverse, this going forth of
his, which is one, is put in the plural number, goings forth. Again, because I
will show that these words, in their own Language, can confute nothing of our
Doctrine; conceive with me then that these goings out may be understood of the
manifestation of his eternal going out to us. So we say the sun shined
oftentimes; Christ's eternal egression compared to the shining of the Sun.
this or that day, when we know that the shining of the Sun is nothing but an
emission and sending forth his light; which act being a proper passi^n of the
Sun, we know its shining out to have been ever since the Sun was created; but
because this blessed act of the Sun is often impeded and hindered from
manifesting its self to us, by Clouds or such impediments, therefore we say it
shines, only when those Clouds are removed, and that shining, which is always
actu exercito, always in operation, has this operation only then manifested
to us; and these shinings of the Sun, in this respect, are said to be many, in
Consideration of those various manifestations, although in its own nature it be
but one; thus this eternal egr^ssion, going forth of the Son of God, although
it be but one in its self, yet, in respect of its manifestations to us by Moses
and the Prophets, it may, in the plural number, be said to be egr^ssions, many:
and yet give me leave to add this, that unless the Sunshine had its being,
it could not have those many egressions and manifestations to us: So unless
our Savior had had a being of old or in the beginning, he could not be said to
have many egressions: but yet, methink's, I am not full enough in my
expression, for taking the words as they require, they may say, that these
egressions were not ab initio, or principio, for the egressions, or rather
manifestations of his egressions were not made in the beginning; if I should
take beginning, as they do, for the beginning of David's reign, they had
their answer, but if principium must be the reading, as we require, and indeed
is countenanced by both Vatablus, Tremelius, and the Septuagint, let it be then
from the beginning; we will distinguish then of a twofold egression of our
Savior, eternal, from the father, and temporal, to us, in his manifestation,
to the world in his Creation, in his Prophets, in his providence, and in this
sense the Divinity of our Savior has diverse egressions, and these were a
principio, and a diebus seculi, from the beginning, and in ancient days.

Sect. 8.
From the beginning] here is not a word, which they do not make a quarrel at;
they are like such a man, who should make a Scarecrow, and then throw stones
at it; How from the beginning may signify from eternity.
or build a Castle in the air, and then shoot at it: first they make the words
of a Sentence what they will, and then quarrel with us that it will not abide
our sense; in particular it is so here: they say it must be read, a principio,
or ab initio, and then they object that eternity has no beginning, nor end,
and therefore it cannot be understood of an eternal emanation, or egression or
going forth: well, let it be granted, that eternity has no beginning, nor end,
which is most true; let it be granted, that what we read from of old, is best
read, from the beginning, which is not necessary; yet, the Consequence is
false, for that eternity, which is God himself, is the beginning of all temporal
things; so that from the beginning is, from eternity. This word beginning has
a twofold Consideration in this, as it is that point, or instant, in which any
line, A twofold consideration of the word Beginning.
or time, begin's to be; or else for that external point, or instant, from
which that point, or instant took its rise; thus we say, a horse began to run,
from that instant in which the sign was given; so we say, it began to be dark,
from such an hour; and indeed in all language, A or Ab often denote causation^,
etc.
used by men, these prepositions, a or ab are used most genuinely to intimate
the ultimum quod non, that instant in which the motion, action, or thing spoke
of, was not, which in our particular, must needs be Eternity; Again, I entreat
the Reader to observe with me, that these prepositions a or ab do not always
signify the Terms, or points and instances, but very often the causations and
the essence, out of which another come's: so we say, the Son come's from the
Father; the heat from the fire; the light from the Sun; now, in this sense,
likewise, a principio, from the beginning, that is (from whose goings forth have
been of old) as they, from the beginning, from God, as from the beginning,
which is eternity, which is God likewise. Thus all things square evenly with
our conceit. I will next examine how it can agree with their exposition; [
From the beginning, say they, is to be understood from the beginning of David's
reign, for this word Beginning is to be applied to the matter precedent, as if
it were, from the beginning of this buisiness which is now treated of, and that
was (as is evident) the rule and government of Israel, as is evident out of the
former part of this verse thus Socinus, where before cited, From the beginning,
not to be understood, from the beginning of David's reign.
and Valkelius, and for assurance they produce those places before mentioned,
Isa. 51.9, 11. and Mal. 3.4. Now he, that will consider those two places, shall
find that the connection so lead's them, that they must needs intimate some
former time, not eternity; but can any man show me a place where beginning, put
absolutely, does signify any of those ancient times, and not that which was
absolutely the beginning of all? I am persuaded, no man can, for, if they
could, these men would have done it, who are most industrious for their own
ends; but then, suppose this were granted, which ought not to be, that this
word beginning may abide such interpretation, what would follow? what
egressions, what goings forth, can they show me to be before he was born at
Bethlehem? yes, they say, out of his forefather David; no say I, the Chick did
not go forth of the egg, much less out of the hen, until it was a Chick;
the Son did not go forth from his Father, until he was; the shining had no
egression out of the Sun, until that shining had its existence, being
necessary to all these actions; and therefore if our Savior had no existence
before his birth at Bethlehem, he could not go forth before; and indeed a man,
who consider's their exposition concerning David, and our Savior's manner of
going forth, by having him, according to his humanity, his Father, may say,
that his goings forth were before the beginning, which yet were a most strange
speech, for he came forth of Judah, Jacob, Isaak, Abraham, Adam, etc. which
were before David; but, as I have said, this might be affirmed of him, after he
was born, that he did come out of those progenitors, according to his humanity,
or, before he was born, The Socinians urged to a contradiction in adjecto.
that he should go forth of them; but to say, before he was born, that his
goings forth, according to that humanity, which should be born afterward, were
long before this prophesy, this is a Contradiction in adjecto, it is
inconsistent; as if I should say, the Chick, that will be hatched a
twelve-moneths hence, has come out of such a hen two or three years past;
these are impossibilities to be used in the same breath, or, as I may speak,
the same verse, the same sentence, to speak in regard of the same thing, of the
same person, that he shall go forth of Bethlehem hereafter; and that he has
gone forth long before.

Sect. 9.
God's descent to man's capacity in the doctrine of his attributes.
Well, I will write no more of this Term, from the beginning: I come now to the
last Term, a diebus Seculi, from the days of age; they quarrel at every
thing; This (say they) cannot be spoken of eternity, for eternity has no
day^s, but is totum simul, without distinction of days; this has been
answered many times; that since the infinite excellencies of God are such, that
man, with his weak and finite understanding, cannot comprehend them in their
proper notions, he is pleased to veil that glory with such Clouds as man may
behold somewhat of him, in part, as the Apostle speak's, darkly, like the Sun
behind a Cloud; and in this manner he teaches all his Attributes, which is
well known, and consented to, by Divines; and in this manner he teaches his
eternity. Particularly that of his eternity.
So Psalm* 102.27. thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end; if he
have years, he has days, one as well as another; so likewise Job 10.5. Are
thy days as the days of man? are thy years, as man's days? there days are
attributed, because man is acquainted with no duration which is not successive;
therefore God is pleased to express himself in such a manner as man is
capable of learning him by; whence, as it is evident in other God's glorious
Attributes, so* in this very particular, eternity is used to be expressed by
his own pen, in such a language as here, by days, and therefore may abide that
sense here; for their expression of David, that his were the days of age, or
time, which were meant here; The Arguments before alleged are of strength
against it; likewise, he could not be said to go forth, when he was not, if he
had no other being but his humanity, which was born long after at Bethlehem.

Sect. 10.
And, to conclude my handling this Argument, I will touch one Argument of
Ochinus from this place, and, The discourse between Ochinus and his Spirit
moderated by the Bishop.
the rather, because the book is not in every man's hand; in his 19. Dialogue,
which is the first of his second book, he make's the interlocutors himself,
who act's the part of an Orthodox man, and Spiritus, which, I conceive, he
would have reputed to be some holy Spirit, which should instruct Ochinus
better; well then, in my edition put out at Basil 1563, (I know not whether
there be any other, unless some pieces in English, translated by an English
Lady, long since,) page 136. Ochinus bring's this place, I have discoursed on,
[ Micheas quoque de Christo loquens, Micheas, speaking of Christ, when he had
said, he should arise out of Bethlehem, adde's this, whose Original was
ancient, from eternal times. In which he shows, that he always, and from
eternity, was begotten of the Father,] to which Spiritus answere's, that [ this
may be spoken of some Spirit created by God before all creatures, that is, from
the beginning; and from the days of time, that is, Olim, heretofore, and
before time, or age (Saeculo is his word) yet not ab aeteruo, from eternity]
the Spirit answere's so, that Photinianisme, and Socinianisme, which conceive
that Christ had no being before that at Bethlehem, is confuted, by this Text;
but, the Spirit was an Arian, who held that Christ was a Creature, according to
a Spiritual being, made before the world. Ochinus therefore presses him
again, [yea, says he, this Text is spoken of an eternal generation of the
Son, therefore he said, Origines, goings out in the plural number, that it
might express how continually, and always, he proceede's, in the individual
moment of eternity, which cannot be said of that created Spirit. Moreover in
Zachary God calle's Christ his Companion, etc.] here the Spirit leave's Ochinus
his Argument, and only falle's upon that place in Zachary; and I am of
opinion, the Spirit was at a loss, and therefore will enlarge my Conceit a
little upon Ochinus his Argument; Who enlarges upon the Argument against the
Photinian or Socinian, and the Arian.
first, it is goings forth, that in the words before signifye's his birth at
Bethlehem; why should it not be so here? Creation was never termed a goeing
forth; it can be nothing then but generation. Then consider, against the Arian,
and this Arian Spirit (for I suppose all that I can find in the Socinian
confuted) that this goeing forth was before the world was created, out of what
must he go forth? there was nothing but God, he must go forth, therefore, out
of him; again, consider, that God is eternal, unchangeable, whatsoever goe's
forth of him must be eternal likewise, or else there must be a change in him;
and therefore this must be eternal, as Ochinus urged, and his Spirit never
answered. Again, it is in the plural number, (goings forth in the days of
Eternity) this cannot be understood of any but an eternal emanation: all other
goings forth have an end, when they are gone forth, and they cannot go forth
again, unless they return back to the place, from whence they came; but
that which goe's forth eternally, went forth yesterday, to day, and a thousand
days ago, days without number, and will be so a^terwards; and, in that
respect, it may be goeings forth* i^ all the days and moments of eternity; but
yet a man may object, that all this is but one goeing forth; it is true, but
yet, that one contayne's in it ten hundred thousand goings forth, like that Sun
which perpetually shine's forth its light, that emanation or goeing forth of
light is one continued Act, yet measuring it by days, or time, it has diverse
goeings forth, according to diverse days, in which it shined, yesterday, the
other day, etc. so may I say of this eternal emanation, or goeing forth, of
the Son of God, from his Father, it was one eternal egression or goeing
forth; but measuring it by days, as it is here, it was an hundred thousand,
his goeings forth were in the days of age or time, as they, or of eternity, as
we read it. Thus I conceive, that the errors of the Photinian, or Socinian,
and the Arian, are both convicted out of this, and it is proved, that our
Savior had not only a being, before his birth at Bethlehem, but from all
eternity; this by the way of egression or emanation* not by creation only,
which was as natural to his spiritual and true being, as his birth at
Bethlehem to his humane nature and name. Having, out of this one place, showed,
that the egression of the Son was natural, I could enlarge my self, upon an
explication of the last Clause of my definition, to show, that the Son of God
is of the same nature with his Father; for having showed how his coming from
the Father is by emanation, egression, not like a thing by force, or made to
set him out a perfect Son, there is no more required but to prove, how he is
of the same nature with the Father; but I love brevity, not to tire the Reader
with the least unnecessary line, because that this will result out of the
exposition of those other names, which are given our Savior in Scripture, I
shall knock off from this, and, by explaining them, hope to stop two gaps with
one bush.

Sect. 1.
THE next name, that I shall undertake to treat of, is that of ( Word) Our
Savior is termed the word; The next name of our Savior, the Word.
and herein I shall treat upon the first part of the first chap. of S. John's
Gospel, which because it is of high concernment in the setting forth of this
Truth, Socinus, besides those many several places, in which he has touched
upon it, has written a distinct Comment upon it; So has Valentinus Smalcius;
I shall consider them both in my Treatise upon this Scripture; and whatsoever
else I find by them, other where, or any other, pertinently objected* to begin
then with Socinus in his explication of the first part of the first chap. of
John, Socinus answered in his Explication of St. John Chapter 1.
put out in Octavo at Racovia 1618. presently after his preface, page 4. [
Primum itaq (says he) quicquid de Ebione and Cerinthio vulgo ostentatur; First
(says he) whatsoever is commonly boasted of concerning Ebion and Cerinthus,
against whom, as if they denied Christ to have been before his mother, John
writ his Gospel, it shall be judged a figment; for, besides that there is no
solid thing brought in its proof, there are not lacking efficacious reasons,
which constrain us to think the contrary] Thus far he; I will draw his reasons
short and answer them; but before he undertake's his reasons he bring's his
surmise, why men were of another opinion from him, such as which he cannot
answer satisfactorily, but in this place put's off; that they understand not
the sense of the Scripture; but I let this discourse alone; his first reason,
why this opinion of St. John's Gospel should be false, is page 6. first [ that
the opinion of Ebion and Cerinthus, was much other (if Ebion were a certain
man) and i^ so declared by all our Age, and in former ages; The opin^on of
Ebion and Cerinthus discussed.
or if we credit Irenaeus a most ancient Writer, who, recording the doctrines
of either, does not so much as show that doctrine, that they should deny, that
Christ, the word of God, was before Mary; yea, when he mention's Cerinthus, he
speake's the clean contrary.] I love not to trouble the Reader with the vanity
of citing Authors; for the clearing of this story, I shall set down what
Irenaeus speake's only; and first for the opinion of Cerinthus, his words are
clear; in his first book Chap. 25. speaking of Cerinthus, he adde's that [
Jesus was not borne of a Virgin, but that he was born of Joseph and Mary, as
all other men; after his baptism Christ descended into him, from that
Principality which is above all, etc.] So that here I observe a double nature
which Cerinthus conceived to be in our Savior, a manhood, which he called
Jesus, begotten by Joseph on Mary; and something above a manhood, which he
called Christ, which, not until he was thirty years old, came into him at his
baptism: that Jesus suffered, as he speake's a little after, but Christ did
not, being spiritual. Thus you see ^renaeus his expression concerning
Cerinthus; where you may observe that he allowe's our Savior no being before
he was borne of Mary, as he terme's her; for although he grant's him an
additionall after his baptism, by the descending down of Christ unto him; yet
that person had no being before, and that additionall was long after his birth
of the blessed Virgin; and it is not expressed that he thought that Christ,
which came into Jesus, had any being before that coming down; And Tertullian
adversus haereticos Number. 312. affirme's of Cerinthus, that he said, [ Christ
was only a man, without Divinity] to which that of Irenaeus well enough
agree's; I quote Tertullian now in Pamelius his edition, 1617. So that there,
it seems, that Cerinthus, concerning our Savior's Divinity, had the same
opinion with Socinus. Well, to go on with the story of Cerinthus, he was a man
of a most turbulent Spirit; Epiphanius says, he was the man that raised the
charge against St. Peter at Jerusalem, Epiphanius contra haeret. tom. 2. cap. 28
for communicating with the Gentiles, Acts 11. in the Case of Cornelius; as
likewise, that he raised the tumult against St. Paul, about Circumcision, with
a whole leaf of such schismatic practices of his; for they say, he was a
Jew by his Father, and so stood, still, for the privileges of their Nation,
and the observation of their Rites; upon this ground the loving Spirit of St.
John, justly abhorred him, and therefore, as Irenaeus in his third Book, and
third Chapter, there are some who have heard Polycarpus report, etc. (which
Polycarpus was constituted, Bishop of Smyrna, by St. John, as Irenaeus,
Eusebius, and all agree, and that Angel of the Church of Smyrna, which St.
John writ to, Apocalypse 2.8.) he, said Irenaeus (who, himself had seen
Polycarpus) reported, that St. John, goeing to wash himself in the Bath at
Ephesus, saw Cerinthus, and presently hasted out again, unwashed, saying, that
he might fear the Bath would fall, where was that enemy of the Truth
Cerinthus; so that here you see two things, that the Opinion of Cerinthus was
much the same with that of the Socinians; that this Cerinthus was abhorred by
St. John, not as a man, but as an enemy to truth; so that St. John, hating his
opinions, might be reasonably thought to provide against them; and all this
evident out of that most ancient Author, which Socinus himself quote's; now
let us see, de facto, what was done: The same Author, Irenaeus, in his eleventh
Chapter of his third Book, somewhat before the middle of that Chapter, affirme's
in express terms, that St. John was willing, by his declaring the Gospel, to
take away the error of Cerinthus; then which we could have nothing more
clear, a most Authentic Author affirming it, upon most just and reasonable
grounds; Socinus then said too much, when he affirmed, that it was far from
all reason, that Saint John should write against Ebion and Cerinthus; here we
see the contrary, as much as it is possible for story to give; but he dispute's
again against it page 7. Deinde versimile non est, etc. Moreover it is not
likely that John would pass over so great a matter so slightly with silence,
but that he would name the haeretiques, or at the least their haeresy, either
secretly, or openly, and detest it; which since he has not done, why did he
not somewhere clearly say, that Christ was by nature God and Man, or that he
existed before he was born of Mary? why did he affect to be so obscure and
sparing, in a thing of so great moment, the ignorance whereof bring's eternal
destruction, etc. thus far he; I will not undertake to understand all the
Apostle's reasons, but am confident, he had abundance of reason for all he did,
but will answer all he says; first that the Scripture seldom set's down the
haeretiques or haeresyes against which it write's, although sometimes it does.
Secondly, to that he says the Apostle does not clearly witness that Christ
was by nature God and Man, or existed before he was born of Mary, I shall show
him that he has, in as clear terms, as possibly could be, although not in
the same; and I am confident, The shifts of the Socinians.
that had he expressed this Mystery in those very words he set's down, he and
his Companions would have cavilled at them, that those Terms are used
otherwise in some places; that there was some Copy, or other, without one of
them, or all; that they did relate to something before, or behind, and not to
Christ; which are their usual evasions; but it is a vanity of them to teach
the Apostle how he should express himself, he has done it abundantly, and as
clearly, as those words would do, as we shall see shortly.

Sect. 2.
St. John's ^eason of his writing not solitary, as Socinus alledg^th.
But he urges farther, that [St. John give's this and no other reason, toward
the end of his Gospel, John 20.31. Cur Jesu signa, (I translate it) why he
writ the Miracles of Jesus or (as others would have it) his whole history, then
that we should believe that Jesus is Christ, the Son of God, and, believing
that, we should have life eternal.] I will not trouble his lection which is
very erroneous, but let the Reader observe, that although St. John say, that
this was the cause why those things, which he writ, were written; yet he uses
not that phrase put upon him by Socinus, this and non aliam and no other; but
suppose he had, this will serve our design, for all we labor for, is to
prove, that our Savior is the Son of God; it is true, these troublesome men
have brought distinctions of the Son into natural and adopted; and the like;
but that he is such a Son, as believing of which we may have eternal life,
can be conceived nothing less, then that he must be the natural Son, of the
same nature with his Father; all other belief, I doubt, will fall short of
that excellency; and therefore, Beza, most genuinely, Beza's genuine lection.
according to the Original (which prepose's an Article both to Christ and the
Son) reade's it thus, That ye should believe that Jesus is that Christ, that
Son of God; which Emphasis does exceedingly much elevate the Conceit of him,
showing him to be an extraordinary Christ, and an extraordinary, not merely an
adopted, Son; which all his Servants are here bound to believe; so that, it
seeme's, St. John writ this Gospel to show, that our Savior was, in some
eminent and peculiar way, the Son of God; Socinus rigula^ in his*
that which he adde's, that believing in him we might have eternal life, is an
absolute avoiding a strong Argument to prove his Godhead; for although I think
by life here is meant eternal life; yet in the Original there is no word of
eternity, but it is word for word, as it is in our English [ye might have life]
through his name, or in his name, (...), that is, his power, his strength,
which none could grant, but the great God; and truly I wonder where he got
that translation, for it is without the Original, nor Beza, nor Erasmus, nor
Montanus, nor any, that I see, But for a little consonance with Tremelius.
but something like it Tremelius his translation out of the Syriacke, and yet
he reserve's that Emphasis, which I make use of, and render's it thus, and when
ye shall believe, ye shall have life eternal by his name, the force of which
last phrase, by his name, was clean omitted by Socinus; so then it seeme's to
me, that if St. John did here, in these words, put down the total reason of
his writing this Gospel (which can never be evinced) yet in this is clearly
taught this Conclusion of our Saviors divinity, and that he was the Son of
God; nor could ever man have understood it in any other sense then we do,
until that foolish conceit of a created God was introduced, of which (God
willing) I entend to treat hereafter. Thus I hope I have given a satisfactory
answer to his objections against the story of Cerinthus, which one thing
granted, the expressions of the rest would be undoubtedly very perspicuous.

Sect. 3.
So now at the last, I will address my self to my business, the first Chap.
of St. John verse 1. In the beginning was the word, etc. there is scarce any
one word in these fourteen or fifteen verses, which I intend (God willing) to
expound, that has not abid some slurre, or other, to discountenance the true
sense of it; I shall begin with the first word, In the beginning, [This (say
they with one consent) is understood of the beginning of the Gospel, How the
Socinians interpret, Joh. 1.1.
which, (say they) was when John Baptist begun to preach,] so Socinus, where
before, at the bottom of page 13. and page 14. In principio erat verbum, In
the beginning was the Word, that is, Christ the Son of God, in the beginning of
the Gospel, to wit, in that time in which John Baptist began to recall the
Israelitish people to the right; and before that, by the preaching of the
Baptist, he was known to the Jews, he was, and he was designed by God to this
Office (that is) of manifesting his will] thus far Socinus; and by this we see
his conceit to be, that in the beginning, With re^erence to the Baptist's
preaching.
was in the beginning of the Baptist's preaching, then was Christ, the word
which was man; he wonder's much, up and down, that men should conceive that St.
John should write such mysteries of Christ's essence, according to his
divinity, where indeed, we think, he make's him write the unreasonable things
of his humanity that ever could have been conceived to be expressed by such
phrases, to understand which I must trespass a little farther upon the
Reader's patience, to consider what these writers mean by this term (Word)
which Socinus and from him, the rest express thus.

Sect. 4.
That [ it is a figurative expression and is meant of Christ in his Office,
not his divine nature; figurative; and so it is either a Metaphor drawn from
the similitude Christ has with our Words; Their Metaphor.
for as our Words express our minds to those we converse withal, so Christ
expressed the Will of God to men; Secondly, by a Metonymy, And Metonymie.
because Christ is the Author of that word which most eminently ought to be
called such, because it is more profitable, and more excellent then all other,
therefore (says he) as Christ sometimes uses a Metaphor, calls himself a
vine, a Shepherd, a gate, because he might most fitly be compared to these,
and now speaking Metonimycally, he says, he is the truth, the life and the
resurrection, because he is the Author and cause of these, so here, etc.] thus
far he; in which he and they have taken a great deal of pains to raise mud
in, and darken this clear stream.

Sect. 5.
To which I shall say first, that these figures are often used by Christ,
Figures never used by Christ, without intimation how the text is to be
understood.
and such expressions under the notions of Divinity more clearly intelligible;
but when they are used by him, he give's some intimation to his Auditor how he
shall understand them figuratively only, either in that place, or some other;
otherwise a man would hardly assent to him in any but a literal sense. There
are abundance of other such like names affirmed of our Savior, besides those
particularly specified by him in this place, all which to handle would require
a Volume: I will not therefore engage upon them, but these, he instanceth in
now, I will touch upon, that by them the rest may be discerned: First then he
call's himself a vine, So that of a vine.
John 15.1. I am the true vine, that is, I am like a true vine, a true, not a
false vine, which look's like a vine, but is not a true vine, that may be
confided in, which will bring forth fruit, and not deceive the husbandman: now
that ye may discern the similitude, observe, he adde's, my Father is the
husbandman, and so go's on with the branches: which evidently show that it is a
Similitude. For the second, John 10.11. I am the good shepherd, A Shepherd.
he explain's it immediately, a good shepherd gives his life for his sheep,
and so along in that chapter he shows how his sheep are righteous, which
make's it apparent that it was a Similitude. Again, his last Metaphor is used
in the same chapter, ver. 7. I am the Door of the sheep; A Door.
we see he was the shepherd, and he is the door, in a diverse sense; as he is
the door, he admit's, and shut's out: now these things are so apparent, that
the words all about them express them to be Similitudes; if not, a thousand
places of Scripture might teach us, that he could not otherwise be a Wooden
door; or a vine, that is, a plant; or a shepherd, such as a country-
shepherd, whose sheep were beasts. Now let us examine his Metonymy: He says,
he is the truth, life, His Metonymies of being the Truth, Life, and
Resurrection, etc.
resurrection; two of these I find in one sentence in the 14. of this Gospel
the 6. I am, says our Savior, the way, the truth, and the life: Truth and
Life are his instances; our Savior having told the Disciples ver. 4. Whither I
go, ye know, and the way ye know: Thomas answered, Lord, we know not whither
thou go, how can we then know the way? Jesus answered to this, I am the way,
the truth, the life; in this word, the way, no doubt but there may be both
those figures he speaks of; a Metaphor first, for as a way is that Middle
place which is between the two Terms ( a quo and ad quem) from whence, and
whither, participating of both and leading whither a man tend's; so our
Savior, God and man, participating of both the extremes, heaven and earth;
and Man, walking a long by him, shall come to heaven; next we may observe a
Metonymy, he was the way, because by his word he direct's us the way; because
by his life he has trod it out for us; and by his graces he help's us to walk
in it; and this is apparent to any man who shall consider how impossible it is,
for Christ to be a way, a trodden path of ground; or how impossible it is for
any such way to lead to the Journeyes end, which he aimed at.

The second Term which is mentioned by Socinus is Truth, The Truth and life
may be taken without a figure.
and for this I may say that I doubt whether there be any figure necessary; for
Christ, as God, being Truth it self, he must needs likewise be verax, true
speaking, as well as verus; and if he should deceive or misguide in the way, he
should go against his nature, and deny himself, as St. Paul phraseth it, 2 Timothy 2.13. now I can justly say that here is no figure; or, if any, it is but
this, which the context exact's, I am the way, by directing you to it, and that
an infallible one, which no man can be deceived by, for I am truth its self,
which make's good all I have said; and the same I may speak of his last Term
( Life) I may justly affirm that there needs be no figure in it; Christ is the
life, there is an Article to every Term, life its self, life in the
fountain; all other lives are Peter's, Paul's, a horse's or dog's life, but he
is life its self, life in the fountain, like light in the Sun, much more
glorious then any other; therefore thou, who seek life, life eternal, which
is the journeys end of every man, must come by the way which I appoint who am
Truth; and come to me, and thou shall have it. I know as he is life in the
fountain, and so may be understood; so he may be a life to us, and called our
life, the life of men, of which hereafter, both as an efficient, and an object;
as an efficient producing that life; as an object, that life of ours consisting
in the beatificall vision of the most sacred and blessed Trinity; but I see no
necessity forcing me to this second exposition; but if so the context lead's to
it, I think I may run through Twenty more, and certainly there are Twenty more,
such speeches; but we shall find that there is something in the matter of the
discourse, or in the Circumstances of the Text, which induce to it; but in that
I have in hand nothing to persuade any man that this Term ( word) should be
understood according to any of those figures.

Sect. 6.
Christ called the Word, according to none of those figures.
Socinus says, it is used now here in Scripture, but in the writings of this
Evangelist; so my search need not be far; in this place of the Gospel in his
first Epistle Chapter 1. Verse 1. that which was from the beginning, which we
have heard, which we have seen, with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and
our hands have handled, of the word of Life, etc. here is no Circumstance
inducing us to search a sense, that merely a man should be called the word, but
rather the contrary, something divine, to which that humanity was united,
because (as here) it was from the beginning; and because, in the second Verse,
that life, of which this is called the word, is termed eternal life, which was
with the Father, and was manifested to us, was eternal, and with him, he must
therefore be eternally with him, this was afterward manifested to us. A third
place is Rev. 19.13. his name is called the word of God; where I can find
again nothing to that sense, but in each place of these, this Term, word, may
most aptly be understood, But according to the Catholic sense is the internal
Word of God.
according to the Orthodox Catholic sense, for the internal word of God; nor
indeed can they show me any thing like it in Scrirture. Let a man conceive with
himself what a strange uncouth phrase it is for a man, who speake's, to be
called the word, which he speake's; yet so must he in their language.

Sect. 7.
Yea, but they have just such another fetch; How Aaron was Moses's mouth.
Aaron is is said, Exodus 4.16. to be Moses his mouth; the phrase is clean
otherwise, and is excellently rendered by our Translators, instead of a mouth,
because Moses had not a clear utterance; the second Instance is that, John
Baptist called a voice.
John Baptist is called a voice; for my part I think it a reasonable exposition
to say, that John Baptist was rather he that made the noise and voice in the
Wilderness, then the voice its self; to which purpose let us look upon the 40.
of Isaiah, verse 3. from whence that Text is made use of, by three Evangelists;
we shall find there, that the Prophet, like a man in a rapture, seeme's to
hear this noise or voice in the Wilderness, and here utter's what he heard; he
saw in his vision John Baptist in a Wilderness, fitting and preparing men for
the Gospel; but the voice he heard was the v^ice of John Baptist, who did
preach that Doctrine there specifyed; I know but one objection of moment can be
framed against this, which is that John 1.23. when John had been asked, who art
thou? he answered, I am the voice, etc. as says the Prophet Isaiah; to this,
first it is memorable, that in the Original it is not, I am, but only ( I) it
is thought by many that this Word I am ought to be understood, but if it be
not, then he does not affirm himself to be the voice, but only leave's them
to apprehend what he is, by the Prophet Isaiah; but if it be, and that we
should read it, as it is commonly ( I am) yet since he quote's the Prophet, I
know no reason why it should be understood in a sense d^ffering from the
Prophets, especially since the two other Evangelists, which mention this place,
have not one word of this I am; St. Matthew 3.3. for this is he which was
spoken of by the Prophet Isaiah, the voice of one crying in the Wilderness; so
likewise St. Luke 3.4. having before delivered, how he preached the Baptism of
Repentance, adde's, as it is written, in the Book of the words of Isaiah the
Prophet, the voice of one, etc. well then, methinke's it is reasonable to
conceive, that John was rather he that cried, as he did there, then the voice,
which was cried; but I reverence the Antiquity which expound it otherwise, and
those heavenly Devotions which the Fathers have deduced from that Metaphor; and
therefore will no further discuss that interpretation, that deliver's John to
be the voice, but grant it, and Aaron the mouth of Moses, in Exodus; the Case
is far differing betwixt these and the word to be taken for Christ, The Wo^d
taken for Christ in a far different sense.
who by them was mere man, in this sentence ( In the beginning was the word)
for consider, Reader, if in Exodus it had been said, the mouth was in the
beginning, or middle, or latter end of a buisinesse, would any man living
interpret that of Aaron, without that Comment which the Spirit of God give's,
when it says, that Aaron should be a Spokesman for Moses, and therefore
instead of a mouth unto him? again, had any Evangelist said, as here, the word
was in the beginning; the voice was in the beginning, could any man have
expounded it without that Gloss, of the Prophet Isaiah's saying, and St.
John's practice? it must therefore be as wild, and reasonlesse, to say, that
this term ( word) when there is no use of Speech, or other phrase in the whole
Book of God, expounding it so, should be so interpreted, that our Savior's
humanity, which by them should speak this word, should be here called the
word. I must beg the Reader's patience, for this tediousness, but the right
understanding of this one syllable ( word) is of high Consideration, and
therefore I have dwelled so long upon it, but now we will strike home.

Sect. 8.
In this sentence ( In the beginning was the word) it is, not possible to
understand this Term ( word) of our Savior's humanity, Not to be understood
of our Savior's humanity.
which did exist in the beginning of the Gospel, which was when St. John began
to preach; for although our Savior was then in being, yet he was not then the
word, for the Gospel was not then preached, but about to be preached, and,
according to them, he was called the word in reference only to that word,
which was the Gospel; so that although he was man before, in the beginning of
the Gospel, yet he could not be, in their notion, the word then, Neither
Metaphorically,
neither Metaphorically, because then he had not revealed the will of God,
concerning the Salvation of men; nor Metonymically, Nor Metonymically.
because, then, this word, which reveale's the will of God, was not produced,
and the Text most expressly set's down the time, in the beginning was the
word.

Sect. 9.
Socinus's shift.
But Socinus has one shift, which is on the top of the 14. page of his Treatise
against the Pasnonienses, page 61. [Christ was then, when John Baptist began to
preach, and was then destined by God to that Office, to wit, in opening, or
preaching the will of God.] Thus far he; now the revealing the will of God is
the nature of the word, and it seeme's, by him, that although Christ was not
actually the word in the beginning of the Gospel, yet he was such in God's
decree, and that may suffice, to make him the word; but let the Reader consider
that he, who is decreed to be any thing, cannot be said to be such, until he
actually exist; now the Text says, In the beginning was the Word, not it shall
be the Word when the decree is expired; was, and shall be, differ as much as
time can distinguish, and yet what the Text says was, Socinus says shall be,
when he says, he was decreed to be; upon such a foundation we may say any
thing, that is or shall be a thousand years hence, was a thousand years ago,
because it was then decreed to be such. And now it seeming to me, that I have
answered whatsoever I have observed, delivered by any man in defense of their
exposition, it will become me to apply my self to the Justification of our
exposition, which thus I do.

Sect. 10.
In the beginning was the word, that is, in the beginning of time, A brief
Paraphra^^ W^^es the first (...) in St John.
of things, when the world was created out of nothing, then was the word, then
it had its being and existence; other things had their beginning, they being
then made, but he being not a thing made in time, but eternal, was then. This
is a short delivering the true sense of the words, and I shall endeavor (God
willing) to explain them.

The first Term which I shall endeavor to expound is this Term (Word) a word
is twofold, internal, A Word internal and external, both of God and Man.
and external; internal is that expression our intellect, or understanding,
has of its conceit within its self; external, is the expression of that
internal conceit, (I will not here stand upon the difference betwixt Sermo
and Verbum, it is not material) that there is such a difference, is apparent
to any man who will consider how he deliver's nothing with his tongue, which he
has not a notion of, in his understanding, before; and that, which he
deliver's with his tongue, is the same which was before in his understanding;
in the Womb when it is in the understanding, in its birth when it is delivered
by the mouth; it had an internal being in the Soul, an external being in the
voice; now words are produced two ways, either by voice, or by the hand; by
the mouth, or the pen; this Philosophy we must needs apprehend, after our weak
manner, to be true; true concerning God, for we cannot think of God as we
ought, but we must think that he does actually know his own infinite
excellencyes, and all whatsoever he intend's to do, or does, in Heaven or
Earth; this knowledge, being active, produces somewhat which is his Word; when
he pleases to express himself outwardly to man, he does it two ways, or by
two sorts of words, written in the hearts of men, or in the Creatures legibly,
which are two Books, in which God expresses his will; or else by voice,
immediately framed by himself, or his Prophets inspired by him; the Scripture
confirme's all this Philosophy; First for men, I need not write of their inward
Words; Psalm. 10.6. speaking of the wicked man, he has said in his heart, I
shall never be removed; so Psalm. 14.1. The fool has said in his heart, there
is no God; many times there are words and Speeches in the heart, which were
never delivered by Tongue or Pen; but never any delivered outwardly, that was
not first conceived inwardly; a man may as well be borne, who was never
conceived; we may discern the Spirit of God, showing us all those ways of
God's speaking, outwardly, Mat. 3. and the last. Lo a voice from Heaven saying,
this is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; so Romans 2.15. which show
the works of the Law written in their hearts; there is an expression by
writing; and Romans 1.19, 20. for God has showed it unto them, for the invisible
things from the creation of the World are clearly seen, being understood by
the things that are made; there we see a writing in the Creatures, and that
written by God, for, says the Text, God has showed it unto them. And for
God's internal word, Psalm. 2.7. The Lord has said unto me, thou art my Son,
this day have I begotten thee; here was a Word spoken internally by God, and
not to man; it was declared to man, but spoken internally only to his Son.
Much more may be added, to this purpose, but I love not to weary my Reader
unnecessarily; The word spoken of in my Text, is this internal word, and
therefore written with an Article, the, or that Word, emphatically; other words
are the words of Isaiah, Jeremiah, John, Peter, or the like; but this was the,
that word, the like of which never was; and to this will agree most aptly all
which St. John discourses, as will appear in my prosecution of it, and to
none other.

Sect. 11.
And in this St. John gives the Son of God no new name, but such as men knew
him by long before Saint John's time; The Philosophers in all ages, The
Philosophers of old called the Son of God his Word.
when their Souls soared so high as to contemplate the essence of God, his
creation and government of the world, they said, he had a Son, or mind, which
proceeded from him like Light from the Sun, (that is a simile they are frequent
in) and they termed that Son his word; and they say, that that Word made the
world, and gave Life and being to all things; thus Trismegistus in the first
Chapter of his Poemander: and Section 4. according to the edition of Flussus,
he saw in his rapture an indefinite Light; then in the fifth Section he
enquired, (...), what comes out of the light? the answer was made, The holy
word, (...), the holy word; then in the sixth Section, when Trismegistus had
begged an expression of this vision, I, says Poemander, I (...) intellectus,
men's, I a Spirit, I translate it, or, as is commonly amongst those
Philosophers, the Supreme Spirit of God, I that Spirit, thy God, am that light:
and presently after, that bright or resplendent Word, which thou did see come
out, is the Son of God; I could show much more to this purpose out of him, but
this is enough to show, that this, which St. John deliver's here, when he
calle's the Son of God the word internal, is according to the language of this
Philosopher; if there could be any farther doubt, let any man read that whole
Chapter, he shall find his expressions extremely full; the same may be found up
and down in Plato, the Sibylls, Zoroaster, and many more, which I need not
name, because the observations out of them are made by many, and as well as
this acknowledged by Socinus, as I shall show presently.

Sect. 12.
As well they who writ after, as who before, St. John.
But this one thing more may be worth the marking, that not only those
Philosophers, which writ before St. John, had these expressions, but those who
lived after him, as Plotinus, Porphyrius, Iamblicus, Proclus; but Amelius, who
lived after him about two hundred years, more or less, observe's this
concordance of St. John with them: it is true, he call's him a Barbarian, as
the pride of the Grecians did all that were not Grecians, but, that, by the
Barbarian, he meant St. John, is evident, because he set's down the words of
this Text, I treat of, and some following verses, and approve's the Consent of
that Barbarian: well then, this being a language of learned men, before St.
John, to call the Son of God the Word of God, in respect of his Divine nature;
and it being observed by Philosophers, who had no by-end, but only the
apprehension of this Evangelist, I see no reason why we should be forced to
give it a violent sense, not used by any, and most unconsisting (as will appear
by the examination of every word) with the rest.

Sect. 13.
This consent of these Philosophers Socinus foresaw, and therefore, Which is
yielded by Socinus.
page 37. of this Treatise, he handle's this Sentence, The word was made flesh,
he says [ Si ea non add^d^sset] If he had not added these words (the word was
made flesh) some man might, and that by right, have fallen into that error,
etc. that he should think that word, of which John write's, to be another
thing, or sometimes to have been another thing from the man Jesus, and perhaps
endowed with Platonical Philosophy, when he should see him here called God, and
in the beginning to be wi^h God, (this is page 38.) to make the world, etc. he
should presently believe that our Evangelist was conformable to Plato, who has
writ of God some things out of which this opinion of the Trinity did flow; and
presently after he says, that other Philosophers had it from Trismegistus] and
acknowledges Iamblichus; so that he yield's that some before, and some after
St. John, understood this phrase of St. John's, according to our exposition;
but I think that he can show me no writer, before, or after, unless Photinians
and themselves, which are the same, that expounded this Text of the humanity of
Christ; what concern's that verse, which Socinus apply's that discourse to, I
shall meet with in its proper place; but what concern's me now, I cannot but
think it reasonable, that when so many learned Authors had philosophized with
such learned discourses concerning God, his Word, and Spirit, under that
language and notion, I cannot but imagine it most congruous to reason, that
those divine Speculations of theirs, so far as true, should be countenanced by
one Evangelist, one infallible Writer of Divine Truths, that every man might
hear God speaking to him in his own language.

Sect. 14.
I am sure the first fathers, almost all, Their language used by the primitive
Fathers and St. Paul.
because they had to do with philosophical men, made use of those conveniences
they had with Scripture, and so did Saint Paul; and I may say of our
Evangelist, that he did frequently make use of their language and expressions,
never b^ulking them, but choosing them before other, where they were fit for his
purpose, and especially Plato: I could instance in very many of this kind,
which any man, who is acquainted with these Authors, know's; but I will select
two or three, which have not, as I know of, been used to such purpose; and the
first shall be out of Plato's Epistle to Hermias, That of Plato con^onant to
holy Job's and our Savior's in St. John.
Erastus, and Coriscus; these three, in that Epistle, he invite's to have a
kindness and friendship one with another, and, to avoid all differences, he
advises to establish a kind of Covenant and Law one with another, and confirm
that even by an oath; in which Oath they should call God to witness, [who is
the Captain of all things, present, and future, and the Lord, who is father of
that Captain, and cause, whom, says he, if we truly philosophize, we shall
know clearly all of us, so far as the nature of a happy soul can attain unto]
in this speech, we see, he clearly set's down the Son of God to be the cause
and governor of all things, as in an hundred, well-nigh, other places; then he
says, such as are virtuous shall see him clearly, as a happy soul can do; what
is this, but, which holy Job, who was before him too, said, I know that my
Redeemer lives, and that in my flesh I shall see God, Job 19.25, 26. and the
same that St. John relate's our Savior to express in his prayer, this is life
eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom
thou have sent, John 17.3. life eternal, that is the felicity Plato speak's of:
it is true, Plato could not say, Jesus Christ, whom thou have sent, because in
his humanity our Savior was not yet seen in the world; but Plato spoke of him
according to his Divinity, that felicity consisted in the clear vision of him;
and, I may truly say, I was extremely delighted with the observations of this
place, and some other more frequently observed; but as I was delighted with
this, so I did admire to find Plato, Plato's de^^^lption of heaven paralleled
to that of St. John in his Revelation.
in his Phoedo, or de anima, describing the heaven where happy souls shall be,
when they are departed from th^s life, by those stones which Saint John does
the heavenly Jerusalem, Rev. 21. Plato set's down three of them, a Sardius, a
Jasper, a Smaragdos, with an etc. that there were more. St. John, in the 19.
verse, put's them down in another order, a Jasper, a Sardius, and the third a
Chalcedony, the fourth an Emerald, which fourth, in the Greek, is Smaragdos;
now I could not but justly wonder at this Consent, and perhaps may think that
there is some greater Mystery in it then is yet discovered; howsoever, this
serve's my turn to show, that St. John never avoided the language and
expressions of these preceding Philosophers, but used them: This Dialogue,
called Phoedo in Plato, contain's that Discourse which Socrates delivered to
his friends, at the day of his death, and his whole Comportment in it; amongst
other passages, having philosophized concerning the immortality of the soul,
and answered all their objections, he falls to treating, how it fared with
souls departed, which died wicked, good, better, best; and therein, describing
the habitations of those happy souls, put's down these very stones, which St.
John mention's, with an Et caetera. This being then apparent, that these
gallant and great Philosophers, both before, and after St. John, used this Term
Word as he does, and that St. John no where avoid's their expressions, it is
reasonable to think he should not do so here, unless we would find some greater
violence offered to the sense of the Text by it, then is yet discovered; or
unless, by some other interpretation, we might discern the meaning more clearly
expounded, when by their way every term is wrested, as will appear.

Sect. 15.
Well, to proceed; this Word being taken for the Son of God, is said, according
to his Divinity, to be in the beginning, absolutely, without any limitation,
when things first leaped out of nothing, The words Being with God signify more
th^n Known to God, against Socinus and h^s ^ollowers
[and (says St. John) the word was with God] Socinus expound's this, thus; [
h^c est, that is Jesus, as he was the word of God, before he was manifested by
the preaching of the Baptist, Soli Deo notus erat, was only known to God]
(mark this word, only) Therefore Valentinus Smalcius was very much to blame,
when in the third part of Smiglecius cap. 26. page 234. editione Racov. 1613.
he says, in express terms, that Socinus does not add (Deo soli) known to
God only, but to God, and not to men; I shall endeavor to confute both what
Socinus, and what he says; they both agree, and so does Valkelius and the
rest, that (...), is as much as to be seen or known of God; that (...), which
we render ( with) signifye's to be discerned; but they are not so elegantly
express, as they were before, to tell us by what figure, but they insist much
upon the negative part; first, that Christ was not known by any, but God,
before St. John's preaching; known he was, but not to be the word; I have
showed that he was not the word, in their sense, before he was preached, but,
that they may have all the Scope that may be, he was not known that he should
be the Word before, but only to God; suppose I granted all this, would it
follow, that to be with God, is to be known of God? it can hardly be deduced,
for then to be with God should signify nothing but the common condition which
bring's to all things, past, present, and to come, for all are known of him;
but they seem to parallel this with the first Epistle of this Evangelist,
Chap. 1.2. where he speaking of eternal life, which was with the Father, and
was manifested to us, there the same (...) is used, as if it were (say they)
was manifest to the Father; take Socinus his own words: [ Quod perinde est,
which is as much as if he should say, we declare to you eternal Life, which
before this no man kn^w, because it was only known to God, who had decreed to
give it you;] this is in his fifteenth page, for understanding which place we
may observe that it is true, that this eternal word of God, which is mentioned
in St. John's Gospel, was hid with God from all bodily eyes, until the
manifestation of it by the incarnation and nativity of our Savior, and that
because he was with God in the bosom of the Father, as it is expressed John
1.18* but after the birth of Christ, in that personal union, it was seen, and
heard, as the first verse of this first chap. of his first Epistle expresses
it; but, in relation to their sense, give me leave to expound that second verse
of the first chap. of the first Epistle of St. John, so much of it as
concerne's our business, which is thus much; we declare to you eternal life,
which was with the Father, and is now manifested to us; this eternal happy
being, which we hope to enjoy hereafter, so much I find consented unto; now
(says Socinus) this Life was only known to God, for ( was with the Father)
must be so understood by them. I deny this, for, without doubt, the Angels know
it, which then enjoyed it, Eternal life before Christ's I^carnation known to
the Angel^, blessed Souls, Prophets, Philosophers.
and those blessed Souls, which were admitted into Abraham's bosom; the
Prophets saw it, and taught this eternal Life; many Philosophers knew it, as I
have showed you, and could produce Twenty more, if it were needful; nor, as
they answer concerning the word, can they say, they did not know the quale or
the quantum, the quality or the quantity of it, for they did know the quality
to consist in the beatifical vision; they did know the quantity, that it was
eternal; so that then this phrase [ which was with God] cannot be understood
of being known to him by being decreed such; so that this phrase may, if not
must, thus be expounded; in the latter part of the preceding verse the Apostle
call's our Savior the word of life; we shall find in the fourth verse of the
first chap. of his Gospel, in him the word was life; in this first verse and
the words this is applied to [ the word was with God] this life then must needs
be with him, because in the word, which was with him, not only because known
by him, Although not till afterward, manifested to others.
but then, when our Savior had divulged the Gospel: then this life, which was
in the word with the Father, was manifested to us, that is divulged, not only
to Prophets by revelation, or Philosophers and Wise men by reason and
contemplation, but even to us men, who cannot soar in so high Speculations
with our discourse to apprehend it by faith, and not only so, but to apprehend
the way of getting it by the merits of Jesus Christ; so that then the Socinian
gloss upon this Text is utterly false, which says, that this Life was only
known to God; when, for ought I find, the Philosophers, many of them, The
Ph^losophers excel the Socinians in this knowledge.
apprehended it much better then they, because they conceived the immortality
of the Soul; and that the Soul coming from God must needs go to him, and
receive according to its works in this flesh; when they, the Socinians,
conceive the Soul of man like a beast's, to return to nothing of its self, but
its corrupted principles, where Philosophers apprehended the Soul to return to
its incorruptible principle, God; so that the text meane's thus much; that the
life which was with God, as in the fountain of it, was by our most blessed
Savior revealed to men in such a way, as might most clearly manifest him to
the meanest Capacity by faith. Socinus has another Text, which he would have
to serve this illustration, but I find it not mentioned by his followers, as
not of force to clear this exposition.

Sect. 16.
This is Luke 2. and the last, Jesus increased in Wisdom and Age (so he, but
better, Stature, Socinus's other Text of no validity to his purpose.
as we) and grace with God and men, that is, in Dei conspectu: the Strength of
this comparison lye's in this Word (with) which is not the same with what was
so rendered in St. John; that was (...), this (...); but I stand not upon this;
the very Sense, be it what it will, will overthrow his exposition, for I must
not run away to other extravagancies; for he could not grow in Wisdom, Stature
or grace in conspectu Dei, which is his gloss, unless he were so re and
indeed; and therefore whatsoever is the sense of these Words, which perhaps an
other occasion may give me opportunity to expound, his exposition cannot be
true; and so I pass from his illustrations of this phrase by Scripture, which
I can observe in any of them, and return to my Text.

Sect. 17.
[ The word was with God) that is (says he) was known to God, and God only,
before the preaching of John Baptist, The Discourse resumed concerning the
knowledge of the Word before the preaching of St. John Baptist.
] thus Smalcius likewise, and Valkelius; what concerne's Angels in this
exclusive word ( Soli) I have already touched; as likewise how he did falsify
Socinus, to say, he did not use it; but they are all peremptory, that no man
knew he was the word, before the preaching of the Baptist; but then being
pinched by Smiglecius with an objection, that he was known to the Shepherds,
to the wise men, to Anna and Simeon, he answer's in his 26. chap. to the third
part of Smig. page 234. thus; that he was known to God, not only that he was,
but his quality, that he was the word: that, before the preaching of John
Baptist, he was known to neither Men, nor Angels; they knew him that he should
be the deliverer of Gods people from the hands of their earthly enemies, but
not to be the word; some knew that he should deliver his people from their
Sins, but this word they knew not. Well, let my Text confute all this, which
says, the word was with God in the beginning, therefore he was then the word;
if they fly to God's foreknowledge in his decree (as I have said) it could not
be affirmed of him, that he was with God, but should hereafter be with him:
then secondly, that he should be the word, in their sense, is no more, but that
he should manifest the will of God concerning men's Salvation, his Gospel-will,
and that was known before; I know not how Smiglecius pressed his Argument,
whether in those general terms, which Smalcius produces, or particular; but to
this very distinction of his I shall press old Simeon's nunc dimittis, Luke
2.32. where our Savior is said to be a light, to lighten the Gentiles; now let
any man imagine how he should be this light, but by revealing this will of God
to them; for my part, I can conceive no other; and yet this is the whole
matter, which they make to be expressed by this Term, word; for although the
Term its self be not expressed, yet it is clea^ly employed, in that the whole
sense of it is either a Metaphor, or a Metonymie, is evident; to this I could
add, that the Prophets foresaw this, so Isaiah 60.3. The Gentiles shall come
to thy light, that is, the light which his Sermons, his miracles did give, and
that evidence of God's will for our Salvation which he did hold forth; this is
enough to show, that the Socinians were over-seen in saying, that, according to
their sense, no man foresaw that our Savior should be the word, as well as in
saying, that God did know him to be such, when he was not such, that is, before
the preaching of the Baptist; and, to conclude; I have no more to do with this
phrase concerning their objections, but set down the true meaning of them,
which is thus. The Word, which I have showed was in the beginning, the
internal Word, was with God, it would not else indeed be from him, for being
an internal effect of his understanding, it proceeded not in^o any external
existence, but remained there eternally, in Sinu Patris, in the bosom of the
Father; but lest any man should doubt that this word might be some accident of
another nature then God was, the Text adde's, the word was God.

Sect. 18.
What the Word is in their Sense, what in ours, is apparent; now it remaine's
whether in theirs, or ours, Whether in the Socinian or Catholic sense may be
more truly said, the Word was God.
it may be most truly said, that the word was God: in their sense it is, that
he, who declare's the will of God, for the Salvation of men, is God; though he
be a man, according to his nature, yet he is a God according to his Office; nor
will I do them that injury to say, they affirm him God only in regard of this
one particular of revealing the will of God, but they say, that plane Div^na
Virtus in illo relucebat. So Socinus in his defense of his Animadversions
contra Pasnonienses, in assertionem primam, cap. 4. page 74. edit. Racov. 1618.
So that the effect of their saying is, that Christ, who was this word, was a
Creature endowed with divine excellencies.

But we say, that this Word which, is a real Word, was God in its nature, by
being the natural Son of the Father, as my Text, he was God.

Sect. 19.
God, with them, no proper name, but an Appellative* and^*
Their exposition of this Text is thus, that this Term, God, is not a proper
name to that infinite excellency which created and governe's Heaven and Earth;
but an Appellative, or name of Office and Authority; not a name signifying any
essence or person, so Socinus upon these Words, and his Followers; but yet he
grant's that (...), it is often applied to the great God of all; he says it is
often given to Angels and Men; he seeme's much to delight in that place, John
10.34. It is written in your Law, I have said ye are Gods, ver. 35. if he call
them Gods, unto whom the word of God came, etc. this he stand's upon in the
Book before specifyed contra Pasno* but in his Comment upon this Text, he
insist's upon that Text, 1 Cor. 8.5. For, though there be that are called Gods,
whether in Heaven or Earth (as there be Gods many, and Lords many) ver. 6. but
unto us there is but one God, etc. [ now (says he) this shewe's, that there
are many Gods, besides the great God, of one of which this Text ought to be
understood,] and, to confirm this, he, in the Chapter before alleged contra
Pasn. page 74. urges, that the Apostle, to show that he meant not the great
God, left out an Article here at (...), which he put before; and this is much
insisted upon by Smalcius, Valk^lius, and the rest; I shall take these in
order, and endeavor to answer them, I think that this same Term (...),
Contrary to the use of it (single) th^oughout the New Testament.
or God in our language, signifye's God in his essence throughout the New
Testament, which is the only Authenticke book we have to give any undoubted
assent unto for any Term there used; for although it may sometimes be otherwise
used, yet there is always some Comment, some words added to it, which do
illustrate it in such a manner, as any reasonable man may discern that it is
applied to an extrinsecall Sense; in this piece I shall apply my self
principally to Crellius, who has a Chapter of purpose against it, being the
13. Chapter of the first Book de Deo and ejus Attributis, not avoiding any
thing I find other where.

Sect. 20.
This Doctrine of mine Crellius allowe's, in such cases, where this word God is
spoken of such powers [quae ne imperia quidem sunt proprie, sed similitudinem
tantum cum eis habent; which are not truly Empires, but have a likeness only
to them,] so says he, Satan, How Satan is called, the God of this World, etc.
is called the God of this Word, 2 Cor. 4.4.] where we see it so explained as
any man may know the true God is not meant; so likewise the Prince of this
World, John 12.3. so likewise the belly, Philip. 3.19. whose God is their
belly; in all which he that runs may read, How the belly, God.
this Word God is a Metaphor, so applied to other things by the very Context,
that he cannot choose but discern it to be used out of its proper sense; but
this is it I contend for, that out of the New Testament no man can show that
this Word in the singular number, without a Comment to expound it, in a diverse
Sense, is used, for any, but for the great God, as it is put here in this; I
have bestowed much pains to examine all places used by this Apostle, either in
his Gospel, Epistles, or Apocalypse, and I can find none, so that, undoubtedly,
it is not his language; that Criticisme which is so much stood upon by
Crellius, Socinus and all of that opinion, The Socinian's Criticisme about the
Article.
that where there is no Article put to a Word, there it may be understood in a
large Sense, but where an Article, in a more strict, for which he tightly
produced St. Cyrill; I answer, That neither with Article, nor without can they
show me any place where this word (...), Answered.
or God, is used in the singular number absolutely, without some addition to
expound it otherwise, for any but the true and great God; if there had been
any, sure, after so much pains as they have taken in this Theme, they would
have found it; so that then this Word God being put absolutely ( the word was
God) without any limitation or exposition, it must be understood of the true
and great God; And Soci^u^'s Instances.
those Instances of Socinus will give no denial to my conclusion; that of John
10.34. where it is said of men, that God had said they were Gods; consider here
the plural number, which one only thing is enough to distinguish them from
the true God, who can be but one; but then read the next words, ver. 35. he
called them Gods, to whom the word of God came: observe here that these Gods
were not such by their nature, but by the power of the word of God, and
therefore must be of another nature from him; so likewise that in 1 Cor. 8.5.
there are Gods many, and Lord* many, that is, many which by Gentiles are
worshipped for Gods and Lords, ver. 6. yet to us there is but one God, etc. a
man may say of these, either they are true Gods or false; if true, they are
Gods to us; if false, we have nothing to do with them; though others magnify
them and adore them for Gods, yet to us they are not Gods; so that here we have
the Context teaching the Sense of these phrases clearly; but in my Text it is
put absolutely, without relation to any particular, and therefore ought to be
allowed in its proper sense; and for the rule of St. Cyrill, How St. Cyr^ll's
rule is to be understood
I may justly say of it, that it is to be understood of such words which in
their genuine and proper signifiation have such a double sense, a large and a
restrained sense, but such Words, which do naturally and properly sign^fie one,
and by a Figure sign^fie other things, when they are used for other things,
they ought to have some Circumstance to expound that they are applied to those
other things, of which nature this word God is, it properly sign^fie's that
Divine excellency; but, when it is affirmed of other things, it is out of some
resemblance or participation of his Divine Excellencies, which are in them; and
then, for what I can find either from them, or mine own Study, there is some
Circumstance or other, which demonstrate's that application to us, as may
appear out of all these instances before.

Sect. 21.
But Smalcius in his Refutation Libelli de divina verbi incarnati natura, cap.
8. page 94. urges against our Conceit thus; [ Si in principio, etc. If in the
beginning with God, or in God (as Smiglecius would have it) none can be but
God, and that which is in God is God, certainly he who says of another, that
he is in God, says likewise that he is God, nor may he add that he is God,
but by a Tautology; therefore because St. John had said before that he was with
God, and added, that he was God, he did not before affirm, that he was God,
when he said, he was with God.] This is his discourse, Smalcius answered about
Tautology.
and it is somewhat perplexed, but the meaning, I guess, is, that this were a
Tautology in St. John, if the Antecedent were true, but I will answer all in a
word; although it be true, that whatsoever is with God eternally must be God,
yet this truth being not so apparent to every man's understanding, it was most
useful, for the instruction of men about these divine Truths, that there should
be some expressions made of it.

But page* 50. Smalcius proceed's with another objection, As likewise to that
objection, God cannot be with himself.
whereas Smiglecius had said, that in this place, God is put absolutely and
properly, which is never said of any man, and had expounded what he mean's by
that phrase absolutely, to wit, when there is no word to show that it is used
improperly (Certe) [Surely (says he) the Word, or Sermo, speech (so he will
render it) is not absolutely here called God, for it is a great demonstration
of an improper signification, that, in the sentence just before, it was said,
The word was with God, to wit, that one God.] I will a little abreviate his
discourse; this cannot be, (says he) if that God be that word or speech, for
(says he) that one God cannot be with himself; that is the force of his
Argument, and my answer I shall draw up short; although nothing, and so not
God, can be with himself, because, to be with whomsoever, intimate's a
diversity; yet that, which is the same in one respect, may differ from him in
another, and, in that regard, be said to be with him, as, in the first, to be
that other: Socrates and Plato are in a Room together, Socrates may properly be
said to be a man, and to be with a man; although these persons in the Trinity
differ not altogether as much as Socrates and Plato, for ought we know, because
these are not distinct individurl natures, as they are; yet being distinct
persons, agreeing in the same nature, they may be, either of them, truly
affirmed to be God, and with one another, which is God; which I think is very
evident to any intell^gent man.

Again, he urges ( Si porro) Moreover, if he be not absolutely God, who is not
the God of all things, and is constituted a God, surely Christ is not God, for
he is not the God of the Father] and the second part, that he was constituted a
God, he prove's out of Acts 2.36. where it is said, that God has made that
same Jesus, whom ye crucified, both Lord and Christ, Lo^d and God not both one.
[Lord or God (says he) are all one] before I go further, I shall deny that;
Lord is a relative, Lord and servant are relatives, but God is an absolute
term, and therefore, as Tertullian excellently dispute's against Hermogenes,
God was eternally God, but not eternally Lord, until the generations of the
Earth were finished; and this distinction is observed all along the first
chapter of Genesis, until the fifth verse of the second; when the world was
completed, he is called God still; but from thence all along the Lord God;
therefore there is a great difference betwixt saying, our Savior was made Lord
of all, and that he was made God; this I put down here, for fear it might slip
out of my head hereafter, when I come to examine the Argument.

To the first piece: The Word God with, though not of the Father.
that this word is not the God of the Father, I answer, the word can have no
eminency beyond him whose word it is: but he is God with the Father, the same
God in essence, coequal, coeternal with him; neither is the Father a God over
the Son, that is, of an higher excellency, as he is God, but as he is man, as
he has all his being, dignity, eminency, whatsoever he has, from the Father;
he is God of God, light of light, but no whit inferior to the Father, but
eternally proceeding from him; as he was man, so he was constituted Lord and
Christ, as he was the word, spoken by God in his etern^l generation; as man, he
was blessed by God in his temporal productions.

And this suffices, for ought I can discern, to answer such Arguments as I
find against our opinion: I would have reserved this for another Discourse; I
intended (God willing) to justify these Truths by reason, but that I thought
thus much necessary to clear this (...). Well then, this being sufficiently
showed, that the word was God, not man, and ought to be understood in its plain
and express terms, that the word was God; I shall proceed.

CHAP. XXXIII.
Of the Word's being with God before the beginning of St. John Baptist's
preaching; And in heaven before his corporeal Ascension thither; Of his acting
in the Creation of the World; What Life is in sin, and how he is called the
Light. St. John's testimony of his Divinity evident enough. Whom Socinus
misinterpret's in what he write's of the Creation. The Bishop's Animadversions
upon Smalcius and Valkelius glosses of the World in St. John. The mystery of
Christ's Incarnation discussed with them; Smalcius's three Quaeries answered.

Sest. 1.
The Socinia^s conceit of the Word being with God in the b^ginning
VErse 2. [ The same was in the beginning with God] There will be little farther
quarrel about these Words, for every term in the sentence has been examined
before; yet, because I have left out one shift of theirs, concerning that being
which the word had with God. I may justly insert that here; which is, that
Christ was the word, in the beginning of the Gospel preached by John Baptist,
ascended up into heaven, and so was with God in the beginning, just so as an
Ambassador goe's to his King, take's, from his* mouth, his direct^ons, and then
goe's about his Embassy; so our Savior, with his very humanity, ascended first
up into heaven, and so was with God, and then went about wording of it*
preaching the Gospel; this is the Conceit of Smalcius, Valkelius; how true, we
must examine.

Sect. 2.
First, it seeme's strange to me, Improbable, having no Evangelical authority.
that it was possible so high and remarkable a passage of our Savior's Life
should no where be recorded by any one of the four Evangelists, when so many
actions of less concernement are registered so exactly; but this is not a
necessary Argument, it is not written, therefore it is not; but, I may say of
that, as St. Augustine once did; it may be with as much reason, and more,
denied, then affirmed; for a man, fifteen hundred years after, to relate an
action of another man's, whose story was written by diverse eyewitnesses, who
mentioned no such thing, one would think were very strange.

Sect. 3.
Yea, but they have Scripture for it, John 6.62. That they pretend to prove's
it not.
What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up, where he was before?
therefore (say they) he was there before, in his humanity; if the Text had
added, in his humanity, the Argument had been somewhat, and of force; but the
words being as they are, where he was before, it will prove, that he was there
before only, which is true of his Divinity, not of his Humanity; The
distinction of Christ's Divinity and Humanity illustrated.
I know they deride this distinction, and speak basely of it, but it is most
true and useful, and I will illustrate it thus: In Socrates, there is a soul
and a body, these two constitute the person of Socrates; we can say of
Socrates, that he is heavy, and earthy, and falls down, it is true of him,
according to his body: we can say again, he is heavenly and light, and ascend's
upward, that is true, according to his soul; yea, we can truly affirm these,
both at the same time, of the same person, taken as that person; so we can say,
Socrates is as high as ever he was, when, by iterated contemplation, he
admire's and adore's God again, which is only by that part which is his soul.
Give me leave to apply this to our purpose: the Divinity and Humanity of Christ
make one person; what is done by either is done by Christ, 1 Cor. 2.8. they
have crucified the Lord of glory, which was according to his Humanity, and he
is the Lord of glory according to his Divinity, not his Humanity; so the same
Christ may be said to ascend up by h^s Humanity, where he was before with his
Divinity. There is one place more which they insist upon, His ascent into
heaven, which they insist on, not corporeal.
that is John 3.13. where our Savior says, No man has ascended up to heaven
but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man, which is in heaven;
here (say they) it is intimated, that he had been in heaven before, because it
is said in the Preterperfect Tense, he ascended; first I will answer ad
homines, that this Text cannot avail their turn; for, first, if it were true,
that he ascended in body, yet it must be such an one as descended first, that
is, such an one as came down from heaven before, and then he must be in heaven
before the beginning, if in the beginning he ascended into heaven (which they
say;) but then mark the Clause, that is, one who is in heaven, when our Savior
spoke it; to the later they say, that (...), existens, being in heaven, because
it is a Participle of the Present Tense, by a Grecism, may be understood of the
Preterperfect Tense, he was in heaven: I confess such a language is many times
used, but that it should be so here, I utterly deny; for it is not fit for us
to think, that our Savior, in so pithy a short delivery of such Mysteries, did
use any Tautology, or unnecessary, or non-significant terms; now consider if he
had said, that no man ascended into heaven, but he that descended, who was in
heaven; what would this last clause add to the rest? no man can ascend up to
heaven, but then he must be in heaven: no man can descend from heaven, but
then, when he descended, he must be there: and this is apparent to every man,
upon the repeating of the very Terms, who understand's them; and therefore if
it should be construed, who was in heaven, there must be something more in it
then I can discern, or else it is a Tautology; but no such thing, taking it,
who is in heaven, because that was neither expressly nor impliedly delivered
before; so then, to understand this Text, we may go two ways, either take
these words figuratively, and that Socinus seems to allow in his 7. chap.
against the 10. of Wiceus thus; a man may be said to ascend into heaven, as I
spoke before (as Socrates) by contemplation, and to descend by looking down and
busieing himself about the things of this world; so God is said to humble
himself, to behold the things that are in heaven and earth, and he is in
heaven, now at this instant, who contemplate's divine Excellencies, even in
this Discourse. Or else we may expound it thus, according to those two natures
which were in that one person; no man ascended, etc. Christ's humanity was
elevated by the incarnation and union it had with his Divinity; it was a great
descent of his Divinity, to be united to his Humanity, and by this Divinity he
is still in heaven; and this mightily enforces his Argument to prove what went
before to Nicodemus; If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how
shall ye believe if I tell you of heavenly things? he reprove's them for not
believing him, who only can tell them, being the only person who is
acquainted truly with heaven, who has been in heaven by ascent, by descent, by
a present inhabitation: now let us see how this can agree with our Savior's
bodily ascent into heaven; indeed in the first sense, I do wonder, Socinus and
they did not apply it to our Savior's being with God, in Contemplation, even
before John Baptist his preaching; but I do not find that they have done it,
but that that Text is environed with so many Circumstances, that would not
abide it, and they only press this for to prove a corporal presence of his
humanity, which the Text will endure, for the reasons before specified, and
this later has no color for them. Well, I have done with what I find they
excuse rather then defend their exposition by; now I shall apply my self to the
con^utation of it.

Sect. 4.
His double capacity of Priest and Layman alleged by them, discussed.
It is a hard thing to prove a negative, and in Logic it lies upon them to
justify what they affirm against all the stream of Christian writers; but I
will endeavor to repeat what others have said before, and argue it clearly;
first then, we may observe Heb. 9.12. it is said, that Christ entered once into
the holy place; this word once intimate's no more, no other time, but then; and
this, a man might think, were clear enough; but they have an evasion; he
entered once as high Priest, at other times before, he entered as a Layman;
methink's they should say, as Ambassador, to receive his commands from his
King. Now, Reader, consider how unfit this answer is for their months;
certainly, if then in the beginning he did go up to heaven in his Humanity, he
was as much a Priest then as the Word, for he was not, nor could be, the Word
by their Doctrine, until he delivered the Will of God; that he could not do,
until he received his Commission and direction from God; if they say, he had
it by the decree and predetermination of God; it is answered, that undoubtedly
so was his Priesthood, and therefore he was then as much Priest as Word; and if
it might be said, the word was with God, a man may say, the Priest was with
him, which that Text to the Hebrews denye's, because it says, he entered but
once into the holy place, which was after his death, therefore, could not be
said to do it before; this Argument, thus pressed, I have not read urged by
others, and I do not know, how they can avoid it; well then, I know not of any
thing more need be said to these words; we see them inconsistent with their
gloss, and not agreeing to ours, who hold, that the word is eternally produced
and with God.

Sect. 5.
I will go on, How all things were made by him*
verse 3. [ all things were made by him] there is not one word which is not
wrested by them: by this ((...)) all things (say they) is understood all things
of the Gospel, for so it is often used in Scripture, not absolutely, but
according to the Subject matter that is in hand; and so it is here, the Gospel
of St. John was the matter in hand, and these things were established by our
Savior; I do not deny, that that phrase all or all things should be understood
of the subject matter; I do deny that the immediate subject matter is the
renovation or Gospel, but is the Creation, for if the Apostle had intended
that, he would rather have used renovation, regeneration, making new, then
absolute making; again, it is evident that St. John, St. John's method very
considerable against the Socinians interpretation.
in this beginning of his Gospel, describe's the nature of Christ, according
to his Divinity, when he was, in the beginning; where he was, with God; what he
was, in himself he was God, in his effects, he made all things; then he come's
to the preparation of the Gospel by John Baptist, and his Gospel by its
self, to his incarnation, he was made flesh; this I put down, to show the
Reader, that to us, who observe this method in the Evangelist, that conceit of
the Gospel, that these words should relate to it, can have no sense; and
again I say, let the Reader observe the places commonly cited by them to this
purpose, that this phrase must be understood according to the subject matter,
he shall find that there is something obvious in them to show a Reader, that
they have such an intention; those places are these, Matthew. 17.11. Mark 13.23.
John 4.25. and 14, 26. and 19, 28. and some other, which are needless to put
down, and would be tedious too; but in all of them there will appear somewhat
inviting a man to that understanding, but in this nothing; Which is such as
permit's the more truth to be in the negative propositions opposite to those in
holy Scripture.
and let the Reader consider, what an uncouth exposition this is, by which I
can put the Contrary to every proposition, and, by their gloss, it will be
more true then the Text; as thus; The word was not God; the Word did not make
all things, for when the beginning was he was not, by them, nor thousands of
years after; with God he was not, otherwise then every thing in the World was
with him, in his presence and knowledge, and that long after the beginning,
contrary to the Text; and he was so far from making all things, that indeed,
(by them) he made nothing, but instituted some Laws and Covenants only; now
what a horrid way is this, of expounding Scripture, only because they are
resolved against our Savior's eternal Divinity? let us go on.

Sect. 6.
[ And without him was nothing made that was made] I believe, that, Christ's
interest in the C^eati^n reinforced against the Socinians gloss
before their glosses had come to this Text, a man could not possibly have put
down more distinct Words; was Heaven, or Earth, or any thing else then what is
comprised in all? if not, then it was not made without him; he made it, who
made all things; yea, but (say they) this must be understood of all the things
of the Gospel; I ask, were other things made? if they were, then they were
made by him, and without him nothing was made, that was made; I know they will
return to their former answer, and say, it must be understood of the subjecta
materia, which was the Gospel, that none of those things that were made were
made without him; but let a man consider whether it be reasonable to refer this
( all things) to such a business; which is treated of two or three verses
after, or rather to those things which immediately follow, that is, the things
that are made; Wherein he was a principal* no bare instrumental Cause.
they have an exception likewise against this Word [ by] all things were made
by him; that signifye's an Instrument, (say they) and by this Christ should be
only here an Isntrumental Cause, by which God wrought these things; so
Smalcius in refutatione libelli de divina verbi incarnati natura. cap. 11. page
68. in my edition, 1614. it is true, he grant's that this Word [ by] is often
used for a principal cause, as is most evident, as we say, that this house was
built by this man, not by his Axe or Hammer, no not by his Servants, yea all
things are said to be made by God; but he saye's, they, who urge this Argument,
must prove, that it is never used otherwise; I say, that is not necessary, in
Logic; it will be enough if he can prove, that it cannot be used otherwise in
this place; and that I hope to do; first against those, who allow our Savior
to make all these things concerning the Gospel; he was the Author of them, and
he must not be understood as an Instrument in respect of the sense that they
give to [ by] here, which make's him to be barely an isntrumental Cause; then
next, taking [ all things] as we do, and surely it must be so, if we
understand, that this Word is an Instrument in the making the world, the Heaven
and Earth, he must be long before he was born of the Virgin, even before these
things themselves were made; which although it will not be of force against the
Arrians, yet is against them; so that let this phrase [ all things] be
understood which way ye will, as they, or we, yet this Word ( by) cannot be
accommodated to their exposition, for a bare isntrumental Cause. There is
another slight objection, Their other slight objection answered.
that the Father is not made by him, nor the holy Spirit; but the Text answer's
this, when it says, without him was nothing made that was made; but let the
Reader observe the same Contrariety to the Text, here, that was before; there
was more a hundred times made without him, then by him; and, The use of words.
if where the full and clear sense of a Text will go one way, it be lawful to
expound it otherwise, because some Word, or Words are otherwhere applied to
another meaning, it is impossible to prove any thing by words; for the liberty
of language does allow it, and the expressions of all Authors make use of it,
to apply the same Words to diverse occasions; and, if this license should be
granted to Expositors, there is no refuge but tradition, The benefit of
Tradition.
which deliver's the sense, not the words, and by that a man may know how, and
in what sense, such language was understood, either in the Apostolical or next
adjacent times; for it is reasonable to think, that they had, with the words,
the sense likewise delivered. Thus I write, because, as appeare's, these men do
use such violence to these Scriptures, as is unreasonable, and without any
consent, to their own intent, as I have showed.

Sect. 7.
It followe's [ In him was life] here in these words I find little Opposition;
Smalc^us handle's them not, How life eternal, and what else is to be
understood. ver. 4.
as not material; Socinus says, this word [ life] must be understood of Life
eternal; I will not deny that life eternal may be meant, and principally
meant, here; but I am confident likewise, that all the life of every thing in
the world may truly be said to be in him, in the word, as in the fountain from
whence it came, and is still preserved equally as the other; but for Life
eternal, it may be said in him, besides that way, as in a fountain, to be in
him likewise, as the m^ritorious cause, yea, as in the object, for in the
knowledge of him will consist much of our eternal happiness hereafter. H^w
both that, and the natural life is said to be the light of men.
I will proceed [ and this Life was the light of men] that is, if we understand
it of the natural Life, this Life, which originally, and preservingly, is in
the word, is that light which enlightneth the understanding in reasonable
things, or the very sensitive in sensitive things; for there is necessary to
sight and understanding a twofold Light, internal and external; internal,
which enable's the power to work; and external, which render's the object
visible; this internal light is that life which God preserve's in any living
thing, that does see; but then apply it to the eternal life inchoate or begun
here, so those graces, which put a man in the State of future happiness, do
likewise, like light, show him the way to it; or for that light perfect in
Heaven; for tha^ glory, which felicitate's and make's us happy, does likewise
enlighten and show that blessed object of the most sacred Trinity. Here we have
no controversy with them, I am brief therefore [ And the light shined in
darkness, How Christ is called the l^ght, according to Socinus.
and the darkness comprehended it not] To this all that Socinus says is, that
Christ is called the light, not only because by heavenly Doctrine he
enlighten's men to Life eternal; but likewise because that, by an
irreprehensible and most holy Life, he shined before them, that they ought to
imitate him, for so he saye's, John 13.15. I have given you an example, that as
I have done, so should ye do likewise; the men of this world were this
darknesse] (says he, How according to the Bishop.
) etc. this has much truth with it, but not all that this Text conteyne^s; for
first, if we conceive Christ to be this light, as he says, we may take him in
a twofold Capacity; as the word, of which was spoke before, the word of God;
then we may consider that this, which was before, shined in his humanity, which
was darkness in Comparison, and that darkness comprehended it not, that is,
obscured it not so, but that some ray or glorious Luster of his Divinity brake
out; or else, the whole person came into the World, which was darkness, and
that darkness labored to crush and suppress him, but did not comprehend him.

Sect. 8.
[ There was a man sent from God, whose name was John] Let me here admonish the
Reader of one word, What (...) signifie's properly, and why rendered was.
to prevent a future objection, with which the whole troop of the Socinians are
full and boast, that is [(...).] which we render [ was] signifye's, in its
proper nature, to be born, or begotten of another, or draw his Original from
another, and from thence, I conceive, the word gigno in Latin to be derived;
but because, amongst all created things, there is nothing which is not
originated, does not draw its being from some other, therefore it is often used
to signify to be; but, I am persuaded, no where in the language of this
Evangelist; and could the Latin or English Language so well bear with the
Graecisme, they would have rendered it, there was a man made sent, factus
missus; but because that sound's harshly in these languages, they choose rather
to be contented with saying, he was sent, then he was made sent; this Caution I
premit, now I meet with the word, for the elegancy of the English rendered it
so, but it was used in its natural sense, where the language would bear it,
all things were made by him, etc. for although the sense be the same, to say,
he was made sent, as to to say, he was sent; yet the English or Latin phrase
better agree's with the latter, then the former; and the Evangelist did, of
purpose, as St. Cyrill thought, change the phrase, from (...), Why the
Evangelist chose to use it, rather then (...), writing of St. John Baptist.
which he had used before, In the beginning was the word, and the word was with
God, and the like, because the word was not made nor created; but when he came
to St. John, although the sense be much the same, he changed the phrase from he
was to that, he was made such, made sent, because he was a made creature.

Sect. 9.
[ The same came for a Witness, Socinus put's a diminution upon St. John's
testimony of Christ.
to bear witness of that light] I find little in these words excepted against
by them, only Socinus urges, that if John Baptist were a Witness of Christ,
he either knew him not to be that great God, or else he very weakly performed
his trust, for he only testified that he was Christ; that he was the Lamb of
God which takes away the sins of the World; that he should baptize with the
holy Ghost and with fire; that he was greater then himself, but nothing of his
being the great God; I put down his sense, and first I answer to his last
Clause, that if he had put it down in the clearest words, that he or I could
invent, they would have found where some of these words had been used to
another sense, some where or other in Scripture; but I am persuaded that he did
witness enough to satisfy any Conscience, that were not absolutely resolved to
the Contrary; Which is evidently affirmat^ve of his Divinity.
for first consider that place in the 29. of this Chapter: Behold the Lamb of
God, which takes away the sins of the World. Who can take away man's sins,
but God? but the great God, against whom they were committed? and therefore he
saye's in the 34. Verse of the same, bearing witness of it, This is the Son of
God, (we mince it in our translation to make the phrase smoothe) there is an
Article at both Son, and God; it should be, that Son of that God, both with an
Emphasis, which these men stand much upon in other places. I know their
expositions of these words, but I bring them for illustration, that a man, who
is not maliciously ben^, might think this enough to express him the God; and
then look upon St. Matthew. 3.11. he shall baptize you with the holy Ghost and
with fire; who could do that, but the great God? then see in the same place,
whose shoes latchet I am not worthy to unty^; certainly the meanest man is
worthy enough to unty the Shooe-latchet of the greatest King in the World, who
is only a man; but if he be God likewise, the greatest is not worthy of the
meanest Office about him. Certainly, St. John Baptist delivered abundantly
enough for the satisfaction of any sober man in this point.

I proceed [ That all men through him might believe] I find no dispute,
concerning this business out of these words; I let them pass therefore; nor
about the two next Verses; I come therefore to the tenth Verse.

Sect. 10.
[He was in the World, and the World was made by him, Socinus misinterprets
creation by recreation, or regeneration.
and the World knew him not.] Socinus, in his Comment upon these Words, boast's
much, page 19. that no man, which he knowe's, expound's them right but
himself; and his exposition is, that the New Testament being full of
Hebraismes* and the Hebrews, having compound Words, do therefore use
uncompounded words for compounds, and so in this place [ the World was made by
him] is as much as re-made, regenerated, made anew; and to this purpose he
produces, Ephesians. 2.10. we are his Workmanship, created in Christ Jesus, unto
good works. Certainly, if there be no clearer Text then this, this Term (made)
need not be wrested to re-makeing; for first let the Reader observe here, that
the word, we render (made) is the word which has abid, and will abide more
dispute, ((...)) which is not in that Sentence to the Ephesians* This word has
hard luck, it is used to all purposes by them; sometimes it signifye's to be,
sometimes to be re-made; but I say, always made, in St. John; so that although
they would show me, that (...) or (...), which are both used in that place, and
rendered Workmanship and created, may be used for recreation, yet it would not
follow, that this word, which is not of kin to them, should endure that
exposition; then, let us consider, that Text in the Ephesians. need not to be
forced to his sense; for, not to stand upon the expositions of learned men, And
in supplie's to his purpose a Text in the Epistle to the Ephesians.
which have applied it to the Creation, that by ( Christ Jesus) is meant our
Savior according to his Divinity, and so in him ( the word) we were all
created to good works; but to take it according to the other sense, that this
Creation is meant of creating those saving and justifying graces, at which the
Apostle seeme's to point, and in regard of them we are said to be created,
those excellent, and supernatural, qualities, being our perfection; so that as
a man may be said to be made, when his soul is put in him; a table, or any
thing, when that work, which give's it the last complement and degree of
perfection, is added to it; so we in the Text are said to be created, but it
does not say men, we are created another thing, which God by these graces
wrought us unto, and, I think, is regeneration; but this phrase does not, in
its nature, signify regeneration, but it signifye's that which is applied to
men, who are fallen from a better to a worse condition; to such men it may
import a regeneration, because it bring's them back to their former state, and
make's them that which was their first condition; and so this creation, in the
Text, has its most genuine and proper sense, which making in my Text should
not have, when it is said, that the world was made by him, if by it should be
understood, the world was re-made or regenerated by him; Again consider, that
if this Text should be understood of regeneration, I mean, that Text to the
Ephesians, it must be by virtue of that phrase ( to good works) [created to
good works] for if the Text had barely said, we had been his Workmanship,
created by him, no man could have construed it regeneration; but now in this
Text, ( the world was made by him) there is no phrase to expound it to any
thing else, but the mere sense of the words; and yet let us see another
violence, if this should be granted, that this phrase (made the world) should
be understood for regenerating; and the world for men; all the world, Another
violence of his in wresting actual regeneration to regeneration in endeavor.
that knowe's any thing of Christianity, knowe's likewise that not half the
world was regenerated; then (say they) it must be understood of our Savior's
endeavor to regenerate the whole; so that making must be taken for
regeneration, regeneration for an endeavor to do it; when, I dare say, he, nor
they, can show me any place in Scripture, where this word (make) is used for
regeneration, much less merely for an endeavor to do it; nay, I do not think,
that they can show me any place, where make is taken for an endeavor, but the
very phrase, intimating a produced effect, is no where used for an ineffectuall
endeavor.

Sect. 11.
But I will leave this Comment of Socinus, although countenanced by his
followers, and apply my self to Smalcius, Smalcius's g^o^^e.
in his 13 cap. refutationis libelli de divina verbi incarnati natura, page 75.
upon these words, (The world was made by him) [We deny (says he) that by the
word (World) is signified the old world; His various significations put upon
the word [World.]
that by the word (made) is signified creation; that by the phrase (by him) is
signified a principal agent. I shall undertake these in their order, as he
handle's them, but his greatest endeavor is about the first word (the world)
which he and I both first meddle with. First, he says, this word (World) has
diverse significations* it signifie's only men; it signifie's the future world;
now (says he) when Saint John says, the world was made by him, may be
understood, that we are reformed by him; in which sense it is said, that Christ
enlighten's every man which comes into the world, as it is said in the
preceding verse; now as Christ is said to enlighten every man, because he used
sufficient means, and endeavored their enlightening, so he is said, to make
the world, that is, the men in it, by endeavoring to reform them.] This is a
cruel thing, to impose upon a man such expositions, Wherein he imposes
fallacies upon his Reader.
where making must be taken for reforming; for although they can show the same
root for these words in Hebrew, yet not in Greek, nor any place in the New
Testament, where the word used for making is used for reforming; and then that
reforming must be understood only an endeavor, not an act, as I have showed.
His second way is, to take this word (World) for the future World, life
eternal, this is page 76. as this Life eternal is revealed, and given by
Christ; see again the violence of this exposition; the world is taken for the
future, in Heaven; this making of it, by the word, is the revealing of it by
Christ; then which never were there heard greater falsifications of any Text;
for illustration of which he bring's the 17. Verse of this Chapter, Grace and
Truth is by Jesus Christ; when there is nothing in these words, which can give
any light to any such sense in the other; for, how can it follow, because
Christ is the Agent, by which his Servants receive grace and truth, therefore
his making the world, should be understood of his revealing or giving eternal
Life; but Valkelius in his fifth Book, de vera religione, cap. 10. page 445.
and 446. give's other illustrations: that this word (World) should signify the
future World; Hebrews 2.5. 2 Peter 3.13. these he put's in the Margin, to
justify this acception of the World for the other, and in all which places it
is observable; there is no one, but the fourth to the Romans, which has this
word (...), The Bishop's Animadversions.
which we render World, in it, and sometimes the word new added, which might
well expound his sense, as in St. Peter; and sometimes no such intent, as he
would have it, to signify the future World so in those places to the Hebrews;
but then, for this place to the Romans, although there is this very word (...)
in it, as the H^ir of the world, yet Christ was Heir of this world, and the
promise was made to Abraham, that all nations in the earth should be blessed in
his seed, and so his Seed should be Heir, Lord of all the world, and have
kingdom and rule over all nations, ever here on earth. These are the principal
things I observe amongst them, to justify their Comment upon that Text; and it
appears, that they have not showed, that this word ((...)) which we render
made, was ever used for regenerating, much less for the intention of it;
again, we may mark, that this word, (...), is never used for the world to come
or heaven, without an addition; when it is put absolutely, as here, it
signifye's the present World. It will be now time to set down mine own
conceit, and vindicate it from such exceptions as they make against it [he was
in the world] that is, the word, not the light, because, in the last Clause,
where it is said, the World knew him not, him is (...), in the Masculine
gender, which agree's to the Word, not to the Light, which is the Neuter gender.

Well then, he was in the world, the great world, the universe, is what was
meant by the word was in the world; and this must be true, because the Word
was God, and he is every where, he in the world, and the world in him; and this
is something that a man learn's here for his Faith, that God is always in the
world, preserving and looking to it; but, suppose a man should take the word in
their Conceit (for a man who preached and taught other men the will of God)
were it not a strange needless speech, for a man to say, that he was in the
world? Take the world how they will, for the great World which we inhabit, or
for the company of men who live in it; (for only in these two senses they
understood World in this place) but to say that the Word, the Word God, was in
the world; here is something delivered that men would listen to.

Sest. 12.
[ And the world was made by him] that is, as he is with it in preserving,
(...) sense ^irectly opposite to that evident in the Text.
so he was with it in making it, at the first, when it was made; let us view
the sense of their way, compared with this: the Word, which is Christ in his
humanity, by his Sermons, Miracles, and Life, made, that is, either reformed
the world, that is men which were in the great World, and this reformation was
intentionall only, he did not do it, in a flat opposition to the Text, as can
be: or else the same, Christ made, that is prepared and fitted to that Heaven,
that place of happiness, into which his Servants shall enter hereafter, when
in the whole Bible they cannot find this word, which is used here for world,
single and alone used for Heaven, or for the reformed or regenerated part of
men; nor that this word, which is here rendered (made) is taken for
regeneration: Reader, this is a strange way of expounding Scripture.

Sect. 13.
[ And the world knew him not] that is, the same world which he made, and in
which he was, knew him not, did not take such notice as they might, by
revelations which were made of him, by the Creature and the Law written in
their hearts; here they except against this exposition of the Term (World,)
that we vary and change the Term from what it was used for, in the former
expositions; there we took the world for the great Mass of created things, but
here we take it for the world of men; I say we do not change the sense of any
Term, The genuine sense of the Terms not changed, as they object.
from the most genuine and natural signification it has; for although very
many, and the greatest number of Expositors do say, that this Term (World) does
signify the men in the world, yet, that very exposition differ's not in sense
from that I have given, no more then if a man should say, that Socrates did see
such or such a thing; or that Socrates his eyes saw it, which is all one; for
men are the eye of the World, by which it is able to discern any thing; and
when it is said, the world knew him not, it must needs be understood that the
men in the world knew him not, because the World can know God by nothing but
its understanding part, which is men. It seeme's by Smalcius in refutatione
libelli de divina verbi incarnati natura, page 18. that Smiglecius had made an
answer, somewhat like this of mine, to which Smalcius replye's, that [ this
answer profit's nothing, for it remaine's firm still, Smalcius's reply to
Smeglecius.
that the word (World) is taken in another sense, in the third Sentence, then
it was in the second; since it is certain, that the world, which did not know
Christ, is another world from that was made by him;] and to the similitude he
answer's, that [ the men, who did not know Christ, are not such a part of the
World* as the eye is of man, for when a man see's not, the whole eye see's not;
but that men knew not Christ, is only affirmed of part of men, and that the
worst part of men, not all men; so that when it is said, that the world knew
him not, it must be understood of man in general, not of the ill, the worst
part of men.] I return to this: first, that such an answer cannot become a
Socinian, Little b^c^ming a Socinian.
who do in general make this Synechdoche, pars pro toto, understood here, and
it is their own way, and not unusual in Scripture; but, secondly, I say again,
that it is true of the whole World, and each particular man, that neither the
whole, nor any particular man in the world, did know him, as they were the
world, the created World, The World knew not the Wo^d, but by supernatural
grace.
but by an addition of supernatural favor and grace; this kind of phrase is
used by Saint Paul, 1 Cor 15.50. Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of
God: it is quatenus, as it is flesh and blood; but when that corruption has
put on incorruption, when that flesh and blood is sanctified, when it is
glorified, and endued with supernatural grace, then it shall inherit and
possess the kingdom of God, and with these eyes they shall see their Redeemer;
so the 1 Cor. 2.14. the natural man receives not the things of the Spirit,
but even St. Peter and St. Paul were natural men, they could not have dyed
else, but quatenus, as natural, he cannot do it; that man, who is a natural
man, can, but not as he is natural, by the virtue and force of his natural
abilities; so it is here, the World [knew him not] that is, by any natural
abilities in that worldly condition, in which it was made, unless perfected by
some more excellent endowmen^s and blessings; The Prophets knew him, but, they
had supernatural assistance; the Shepherds they discern him at his birth,
but Angels, told it them; to conclude, we cannot apprehend him, as he is, by
any worldly assistance; What men app^ehend of God by natural abilities.
I am persuaded that men have by the natural abilities, which God has given
them, and the consideration of his Creatures, found out and known, that God
made the world, and that he rule's and governe's it by a most exact Wisdom;
but that this Wisdom should be a person; that this person should be the Son of
God; without some other Light, then he h^th naturally, a man cannot perceive
it; for, although it be a most received Axiom in the School, that Omnia opera
Dei ad extra sunt indivisa, that all the outward works of God are wrought by
the whole Trinity; yet, they are done by such an unity of the Trinity, as is
not observed out of those vestigia's (as they speak,) those partial
representations which are in the Creature of it; and therefore, I am persuaded,
that Trismegistus, Socrates, Plato, and such others, who have such lively
expressions of these mysteries, either had some revelations made to them from
above, or else had met with some Prophet or prophetic writing, upon which they
confiding were bold, out of t^em, to make these expositions; to this, which I
have said, I cannot discern any thing answered, because I have not known it
urged to that height by others; nor do I know, what they can object, unless it
be, The objection about Saint Joh^'s upbraiding the world answered.
that St. John seeme's to upbraid the world with ingratitude, that they should
not take notice of so great a goodness of God's who made it; but this cannot
be justly urged against them, who could not know him, whom, as it seems by
discourse, the world could not; to this I answer; that for any thing I see,
such an intention of the Text is yielded to by writers on both sides, but I
discern nothing in the Text that enforces any more then an historiall
narrative of the nature and condition of the World, that he was undiscerned in
the world, until some supernatural blessing enlightened men; I cannot discern
any such upbraiding, as they speak of, but if there be any moral intention
besides the history, there is nothing can be deduced more naturally, then, that
men, who have this light, are bound to a grateful acknowledgment of all they
have, to arise from God, both natural and spiritual things, and to use them
to his glory; or, if men will apprehend such a thing as upbraiding, be it, that
they may think it consisted in this, that the generality did not know him as
they might, men did not apprehend so much as was apprehendible of him; but I
choose rather the first exposition, although the second be the common road; and
I proceed to the next Verse.

The exposition of the words immediately following, why omitted.
[ He came unto his own, and his own received him not] this and the two next
Verses yield a great many heavenly meditations, which I could delight to
discourse, as well as think of, but they are not pertinent to this business I
have in hand, to show, that our Savior was the word of God, which was God.

Sect. 14.
I therefore let them pass, and come to the 14. Verse, where we find
opposition from them with much art, which we render thus [ And the Word was
made flesh, and dwelt amongst us] there are two propositions in this particle [
And the Word was made flesh, The Socinians Word could not be made Flesh.
] that is the first: Here, by the Word, the Socinian understand's the same Word
as before, Christ, as by preaching and Miracles, he manifested the will of God
to men; but that this could not be made flesh, is evident, because it was flesh
always, and nothing can be made that which it is; but this Word was always
such; if it had been, that flesh was made the Word, there had been some sense
in it, because then we had understood that that man, who at the first was not
the Word, by preaching, etc. was made the Word; but, this sentence [ the Word
was made flesh] abide's no such construction; to avoid this, therefore, they
fly to that other Term [ was made] of which I have treated before, when it came
in my way, Their evasion.
at the sixth Verse; this word, (say they with one consent) signifye's (to be)
and it should be read [ the word was fl^sh] this I have examined before and
showed, that I can find no place in St. John, where [(...)] is so used, (...)
and (...) how used in the beginning of St. John's Gospel.
that necessarily men must understand it in their sense; so that that place, in
the sixth Verse, was so read for the smoothness of the Latin or English
Language, which would not abide the verbal translation of the Greek; now I
will add thus much; in these 14. Verses, (...) is used for ( was) or ( being)
at the least nine or ten times; and (...), or (...), five or six times for
made; what reason can we imagine, that the style or language should be altered
here? but then, let us consider what the sense would be, if the Text were read
as they would make us believe [ the Word was flesh] as much as if we should
say, the preacher was a man, which were a most ridiculous speech; and
therefore, to avoid this, they fly to this Term flesh, and say, Their heterodox
interpretation of flesh.
that that Term does not signify flesh its self, or a man clothed with flesh,
pars pro toto, which is often in Scripture; but the humble estate of a man; and
here they bestow much Rhetoric, to show, that the Evangelist, having spoken so
great things of the Word, that it was with God, was God; that all things were
made by him, etc. lest men should enter into this vain Conceit, that he was
the great God, he pluck's him down to consider, that he is but a weak man,
flesh, subject to many miseries and misfortunes, death and injuries, etc.
observe here that this word Flesh in its natural and proper meaning,
signifye's a part of man in a figurative manner, by a Synechdoche it signifye's
the whole; but, for any thing I can discern, Not evident in Scripture.
in Scripture it is not used for any base or miserable condition of man, but
only in general Terms, to show, that man, whilst he live's in flesh, is
subject to the infirmities of it: the places produced by Socinus speak no more,
Cited by Socinus.
the first is Psalm. 78.39. he remembered that they were but flesh; here is a
speech concerning the Israelites in their general State, as men, and as frail
and weak, but no particular dejectedness of their Condition, but that they
were no better then men. His second place is, Isaiah 40.6. All flesh is grass,
and all the goodlinesse thereof as the flower of the field; suppose I should
yield, that here by flesh is reprepresented a low and mean Condition; yet here
is such a Comment joined to this word flesh, as enforces that conceit; but in
my Text there is no such thing; so that still I may say, that this Term flesh
teaches us no such thing, without an addition of such other language, as may
render it of that sense; but then again, all the expression of any lowness or
dejectedness of estate, that is here made, is nothing else but the general
cond^tion of mankind, no particular humiliation meant by it; and that is
evident out of that phrase [ all flesh is grass, etc.] this sign (all) shows
it to be meant universally. So likewise Jeremiah 17.5. Cursed be the man that
trusts in man, and makes flesh his arm. Here is no manner of unhappy
condition taught by flesh, but that it is a Creature, and must not be confided
in like God. These are the places u^ged by Socinus, and whatsoever I find any
where of the same nature; so that I do not find flesh taken for the most
unhappy sort of men, but for men in general; and when it is said [ the word
was made flesh] it must, for ought appears yet, be understood, was made man,
such a thing which was a creature, which creature was subject to infirmity;
but, for a greater evidence to this truth, let us see what will be the result
of their Comment, to wit this; that the word, which was the man Christ, The
result of their Comment.
who preached and taught the will of God to men, was in the beginning of the
Gospel; was with God, that is, known only to him; was God, that is, a man in
Authority; all things were made by him, that is, all things were established
concerning man's reformation in order to heaven, etc. he was in the World, a
great strange thing, how could he be out? and the world was made by him, that
is, intended to be reformed; but, because so great things were spoken of him,
to pluck down men's overweening conceit, he is said to be flesh; could any
man, that understand's these words, as they would have men, conceive he was
other? is there any thing, that is delivered in their pretense of the import of
these words, that should endanger a man to think otherwise? certainly no; and
therefore, throughout all that they have said, is a monstrous violence to Gods
word. Well, now our exposition, which is most natural to this Text, will
appear in its self; the word, the inward word of God, which in its sense was
eternal, The sum of ours.
was made flesh in time; I know nothing of moment objected against this.

Sect. 15.
But the impossibility that God should be made man, st^ll remaining God;
[nothing (say they) is made another, but it cease to be its self, when it is
made that other; so water, when by rarefaction it is made air, cease to be
water, and the like] so Socinus upon this place, page 39. so Smalcius cap. 17.
refutationis libelli, etc. so often named, page 99 and 100. To this we can
answer, that although nothing can be made another, by mutation, but it cease
from its own being, The union of the Divin^ty with the humanity implies no
mutation of God into Man.
yet it may by union; So the soul and body united may make one person, but this
they oppose, [that by this union the body is not affirmed to be the soul, but
animatum, a living creature, as we speak; now the effect of this action is,
that God must be man, the like predication is not in the world] (say they) what
then? Notwithstanding the pred^cation, God is Man*
must not this be true? there is but one Sun, must there be more because there
is but one? that there is no more such, make's it seem the more divine; the
like, the equality of which is not to be found in the Creatures; and therefore,
this ought not to be urged any further. Yet, because they seem unsatisfied
without such an answer, although that is not like Christians, give me leave to
labor for some easy expressions, which thus I do; Which is asserted, and by a
familliar instance illustrated.
A piece of Iron stands by, or in the fire, it get's heat and is made hot,
which it was not before, and yet it remaine's Iron still; it is true, it is not
caliditas, heat its self, but hot; no more can we say that the divinity is the
humanity, but God is man: the I^on is made hot; Their Objection.
yea, [ but (say they) here is an addition of an accident to a substance, a
subject; but in the case of God and man, here, you would have two substances
united and made one] I shall then philosophize higher then I have hitherto,
Answered by the dependa^^^ of substances up on God.
and say, that in respect, of God, all substances to him are but as accidents
to other subjects; as accidents have a dependence upon the subject, so
substances upon him, he is only ens per se subsistens, the thing which has
its subsistence by its self, independing upon any other, all other substances
like accidents live, move, and have their being in and by him; so that
substances are supported by him, accidents by substances; and he may as well be
made a man, as a body white, warm, cold, or the like; for all substances
having not their existence only, but their manner of existing, depending upon
him, as any accident has its manner of existing depending upon a body, there
is no reason, if he please to unite himself to any of them, why he may not do
it.

Smalcius urges another Argument thus; Another Argument of Smalcius's.
[ If the word be made flesh, one of these two will follow, either that the
true word is not man, if it take the person of a man; or else that there are
two persons of the word and of man, and so two Sons of God in Christ, if he
have either person] To these I will answer apart, Answered by the manner of
existing.
as they are two dividing members; to the first; the true word is man, though
it lack the personality of a man, which is thus showed; personality is the
modus, the manner of existing of a reasonable substance, the subsistence; as
inhaesion or dependence, is the manner of existing amongst accidents, so is
subsistence with substances, and personality is that to reasonable substances;
now, as if God should suspend this last complement and addition to the
existence of an accident, which I make no doubt of (and am confident well may
be proved, but will be granted) then this accident should exist without its
usual and commoner way of being; so, if God please to suspend this last usual
manner of subsisting by its self, from any substance, it would and might exist
without it; as we may conceive the body of man to be a being before the
infusion of the Soul, yea has a subsistence of its self; yet after and at
that instant of the infusion of the Soul, it receive's a new manner, which it
had not before, and growe's a person, and exist's with and by it; so may any
man conceive that the man Christ, united to the divinity, exist's not with a
humane personality, but that more excellent of the word of God, the perfection
and excellentest piece in every thing, giving the denomination to every thing.

And yet, he is a man existing in the person of the divinity; Smalcius, in his
urging this Argument, insult's mightily (says he) [ it is enquired whether it
be a true man, Christ a true man* though a divine pers^n.
which is not an humane person,] I answer; yes, it is a true man, and a person,
but a divine person, to be a man and a true man, is to have a reasonable Soul
and a body; this he has, although the manner of his existence be not
terminated in this, but the divinity; he goes on and urges [that Christ was
conceived in the Womb of the blessed Virgin, Whose conception and gestation in
the blessed Virgin's w^mb conduced nothing to his personality.
a just time sustained there, and at the last borne, all which (says he)
pertaines to the constituting a person] I answer, he was thus, although these
had nothing to do in the Constitution of his person; these were but the common
producers of any individual humane nature, and so, by consequence, were
accidents of ordinary personality, although they were undiscerned to work any
thing, nay they could work nothing in his personality.

The Divinity an humanity uni^ed render him neither two Sons nor two persons.
To the second part of this distinction [ or else there must be two distinct
persons, and so two Sons] that which has been delivered is sufficient to
answer, that there is but one Son, and one person, as Athanasius in his Creed;
as the Soul and Body make one man so the Divinity and Humanity make one Christ;
the Soul and Body have but one subsistence, when they are united, but, two,
when they are severed; so if the humanity had not been taken ken into the Word,
or should be left by it, there would be two distinct subsistences, and two
distinct persons, but being, as they are, united, there is but one.

Sect. 16.
He has another objection, which he esteem's of very great force, page 102.
which is thus framed: Object. Of his being the same God with the Father and the
holy Ghost.
[When the word is the same God with the Father and the holy Ghost, it should
follow, if the Word be made flesh, that the Father and the holy Ghost should be
made flesh likewise, and so it would agree to the Father and the holy Ghost, to
be conceived, born, die, arise again, as well as to the Son, because Omnia
opera, etc. all the outward works of the Trinity are inseparable.] For answer
to this, Answer* Which identity implies not that they were made flesh with him.
I grant that Axiom to be true, and so far forth as there is any outward
action, it is most true, that the whole Trinity conspired in that Act; they all
produced this man Christ our Savior; they all preserved him in his being; but
the humanity of our Savior was united only to the Word, which was his
Divinity, and this union was it by which he was made man, nor, in respect of
it, can it be said, that that was an external Action, but a taking the
humanity into unity with its self; for although the object be an external
thing, yet the act being internal, a reception, not an extramission, or
working without upon it, it need be no more called an external act, then God's
knowledge of the Creatures, whose object is external, but the act internal;
for all that can be said of this, is, that this manhood is united to the Word,
which union may well be a work of the Trinity, although terminated in the Son;
as when a man tye's a knot, by which two points, or any other things are
united, the union is wrought by the man, but terminated in these two; so,
though this unity is wrought by the Trinity, yet it is terminated in the Word
and humanity, not in the other persons; or, if you would have it closer,
suppose a man should glue a ring to the middle joint of his little finger, the
man made this union, but it is only united or terminated in that joint; nor
can we imagine what outward work was terminated by that joint. Scotus to this
purpose excellently: [A point terminate^s a line, As Scotus illust^ate's
excellently.
yet has no outward work upon it; one relation terminate's another, the Son
the Father, yet has no outward causation or work upon him; this termination,
which personality give's to any individual nature, give's it only a finition,
and stint's it in these particular bounds, but has no external work upon it
at all; so that the Father and the holy Ghost produce all the outward work with
the Son, but the Son only is interested in the union, by being made flesh,
etc.] Good Reader, if my weak expressions have not rendered this high Mystery
lively to thy Capacity, The Bishop's apology to the Reader.
excuse me, I have done mine endeavor; and since they labor with
Philosophical tricks and nice ties, to ^ustian and amaze this discourse, I
must cross them in their own way, or else their triumph will be endless; the
truth is, these Mysteries are revealed quod sunt, that they are, and men ought
to bel^eve that, and should go no farther; but when witty men, with wicked
reason, shall labor to lay stumbling blocks of reason in our way to heaven, it
becom's us to lay them aside, which I hope, by the assistance of that God
(whose glory I endeavor) I have, and shall do. Smalcius, where before cited,
adde's great vaunts of this Argument with most opprobrious Terms, which I
meddle not with as impertinent.

Sect. 17.
But because he make's some Queries, which he think's, or seems to think, are
able to stumble a Reader, being unanswerable, I shall, putting them down,
endeavor to answer them; although I may justly say, in cases of this nature,
it is as true as in any, that a weak and silly man may ask more, then a learned
man can answer. His first is ( Potest ne fieri, can it be, that he, who is God,
can do any thing, not as God, or in the nature of God? Sm^lcius's first Q^erie,
etc.
) this last phrase ( or in the nature of God) seems to me a strange exposition
of that ( as God) for quatenus ipsum, Rectifyed.
is not in the nature of the thing which act's, but according to the nature, or
to act out of the Principles of that nature; now that may be done even by God
in these outward acts of creating and governing the Creature, which acts are
not in, but out of his nature, although according to his nature; I do not
understand quatenus here in the strictest sense of Logicians, for that which is
reciprocal, but in a larger, as I expounded, it; Answered. All actions not
always necessari^y according to the nature of him, or that which act's.
To the Q^estion its self: I answer to it, as it seems to be proposed, as if
it were in general, that nothing can act any thing which is not out of the
principles of its nature; for this, consider, Socrates is a man, yet he can
affect sensual things, which he does, not as a man, but as a beast, or a
sensitive Creature; he grows and the like, not as a man, that is, out of the
principles of humanity, but as a vegetable; again, Socrates is a Son, or a
Father, or both; he does many things as neither; he does many, being a Son, and
a man; as a Son out of the principles of Sonship, not as man out of the
principles of humanity; so that when any thing has a substantial essence and a
relative, it may act out of the principles of that relative condition it has,
and not out of the essential nature it has; if he speak, as he does, of the
persons of the Trinity, no doubt, but those personal actions and relations
betwixt Father, Son and holy Spirit, although done and acted in that essence,
yet are not essential, but personal; and for other acts, if any person assume
any thing into a personal union with it, it may act by and in that united
nature, that which it act's, not according to his Divine, that is, out of that
principle; thus may it eat, walk, and the like; this (because he still
require's instances from the Creature) is evident out of them; a man, when his
hand is warmed by fire, or cooled by Frost, can, by putting his hand to
another, warm or cool another's hand, still being a m^n, he act's according to
the Condition of that quality, which is added to him, and not according to the
principles of humanity.

His second Quere is [ Can it be, that a Divine person can be a diverse thing
from the Divine nature] I think, Smalius's second Querie Answe^ed and
frustrated.
amongst a thousand which he may read, that have written about this business,
who are Orthodox, he can show none that ever affirmed it it; they say that the
Father, Son and Spirit are diverse persons, but not diverse things, diversus
est filius, not diversum, a diverse person, not a diverse substance.

His third and last Quere is [ Whether it may be, that there should be the same
nature of all three persons, His third Querie
and yet, one of these persons acting something, the nature should not act that
same thing?] he instances in the incarnation, birth, death, etc. of the Son,
which had the Divine nature, and yet the Father and the holy Spirit, which had
the same nature and essence numero, that is, in number, with the Son, Answered,
with reference to the discourse before concerning the incarnation of the Father
and holy Ghost.
should not be incarnate, born, etc.] To this, I conceive, I have spoken
sufficiently already, where I have showed, that one person can be incarnate,
and not the other, which when it is granted, all the rest will follow, he may
be conceived, born, dye, etc. in that nature which was united to him, although
not in that of which he was a person; which has been a most Catholic
universally received truth, these thousand years and upward, in the Christian
world, and therefore ought, if refused, to be confuted with reasons, not with
opposition only of the Authority of two or three men, by a plain denial and
no more. This is all, of any moment, that I find objected against the
exposition of this place, which I hope I have satisfied, and in it evinced,
that our Savior is a person in the Trinity, equal with the Father, and
distinct from the Father.

Sect. 18.
Which being done, it must needs follow, that Mr. Hobbes was much too bold with
him, when he said, he did personate the Father; which, as it is a language
unheard of in Scripture, so it is impossible to be true, he being equal to him
in all things, and co-acting with him whatsoever he did, in Heaven or Earth;
what he adde's [that our Savior came to ^educe the Jews, and induce all
Nations into the Kingdom of his Father, not as of himself, Our Savior's
mission derogate's nothing from the authori^y and plenitude of power in himself.
but as sent from his Father] was weakly affirmed, if not worse; for although
in that errand he was sent by the Father, as he was man, yet he, with plenarity
of power, did execute the same, as he was the Son of God, and God united to
that manhood; of which I think to discourse more fully hereafter; but in a word
for the present, t^ke that only one Sentence of our Savior's, which is the
latter part of the 21. Verse of the 20. Chapter of St. John; As my Father has
sent me, even so send I you; this was spoken to his Apostles; here the Father
sent Christ as man, to bear witness to the Truth, John 18.37. for this end was
I born, and for this end came I into the world, that I should b^ar witness to
the truth; so did he command his Apostles, Matthew. 28.19, 20. Go teach all
nations, Which he exercised in giving commission to his Apostles.
or discipulize them, Verse 20. teaching them to observe all thing whatsoever I
have commanded you; where we see that his Authority sent them in the same
errand that he was sent in himself; then next, which is most pertinent to this
purpose, in the 18. Ver. of the same 28. of St. Matthew. he says, All power is
given me in Heaven and in Earth; so if he did not give them such Power or
Authority, where the greatest power is given, there the less is included,
Matthew. 10.1. he gave them power over unclean spirits, those are the greatest
and most powerful things in the world; so likewise John 20.23. whosesoever
sins ye remit, they are remitted, etc. there the power of Heaven and Earth is
both included; and in none of these is that unworthy diminishing Term added
which Mr. Hobbes intrude's, (not as of himself) for, although, as man his
Authority is derivative, yet, as God, he gave these powers with Authority
immediately from himself, with no expression of any delegation to do it; let
this suffice, as at the present, for the examination of that speech of his;
concerning which I intend a farther indagation in a fuller discourse, which the
opportunity of another error will invite me to.

CHAP. XXXIV.
The Holy Ghost proved to be neither Attribute, nor Gospel, nor a mere gift
(as the Socinians fancy;) but the third person in the holy Trinity.

Sect. 1.
ANd now, my next undertaking must be, to do as much for the holy Spirit, which
I shall endeavor to do exceeding briefly: and first, I will set down what
mistakes have misguided the Adversaries of this Truth, and vindicating it from
them, shall confirm the said Truth with only one Argument which I conceive
convincing of it. First then, The Socinian's opinion of the holy Ghost.
the Socinians deliver, that the holy Ghost is an Attribute of the Deity, not a
person; that it is the virtue and power of God, by which he operate's and
produces those effects that are wrought amongst us, but not a distinct person
from either the Father or Son;] To confute this, I shall produce that one
place, Confuted, and this proved, that he is a distinct person of the Trinity,
not a mere Attribute of the Deity.
Luke 3.22. and the holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon
him, and lo, a voice from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son, in thee
I am well pleased; the Story of this is evidently thus, Our Savior was now
baptized, and, being gone up, out of the water, as St. Matthew. 3.16. he prayed,
and then the holy Spirit thus descended upon him; that this was not the power
of God, is evident, because, I think, no man can show me a bare Attribute of
God represented or said to appear in a bodily shape, but a person or the
essence; and secondly, if there were an Attribute expressed here by this bodily
apparition, it could not be the power of God, that operating power, by which
his wonderful works are wrought, because the innocent unacting nature of a
dove does the least express that of any other, but, as Erasmus most
excellently paraphrase's upon the place, he shows us here, that as the dove
brought a^ Olive branch after the deluge to Noah, in taken that the waters were
assuaged, and the wrath of God pacifyed toward mankind; so the holy Spirit,
after the Baptism of our Savior, by whose Baptism ours received a
confirmation, if not an institution, by which, like as by the Ark of No^h, we
are delivered from the wrath of God; the holy Spirit appeared in the shape of
that Divine messenger before, and brought us comfort, that we shall be
delivered as in the Ark; to which St. Peter allude's 1.3.21. the like figure
whereunto (that is of the Ark, spoken of in the 20. Verse) is Baptism; well,
by no means could it any way notify the power of God in this shape, but his
kindness and meekness; now likewise, that it is a distinct person from the
other, is evident, because in this very Verse, the other persons are not
intimated only, but expressed, the voice from heaven uttering these words,
thou art my, etc. manifesting the Father, and the person spoken to declaring
the Son.

Sect. 2.
But I find another opinion amongst them, which is in the Racovian Catechism,
Chapter 6. de Christi prophetico munere, page 162. in that edition I use now,
at Racovia, 1651. where the question being put, Quid vero Spiritus Sanctus?
What is the holy Ghost? he answer's, that first in the New Testament the
Gospel of Christ is designed by it; the Catechism produces two places of
Scripture to prove this by: the first, 1 Cor. 2.10. but God has revealed them,
(that is, the things which he has prepared for them that love him) unto us by
his Spirit, where, say those Divines, the holy Spirit is said to reveal the
Mysteries of Godliness to God's Servants] the other is 2 Timothy 1.10. where it
is said, God has brought life and immortality to light by the Gospel; [ now,
say they, in this latter place, the Gospel is said to do that which the Spirit
was said to act in the former; therefore they are one.]

A most piteous Argument: The Fire, a Candle, No^ the Gospel o^ Christ, as they
pretend out of holy Scripture.
and the Sun, make us see the same thing, therefore they three are one; but
more closely; the internal light in mine eye, or whatsoever it is that fit's
the Organ for discerning, and the external light of the Sun, which
illuminate's the object, both make me perceive the same visible object,
therefore, by their Logic, they are one, which is absurd; so is it with these
two, the carnal or natural man, of himself, cannot behold the things of the
Spirit, God therefore infuseth into him the holy Ghost, by which he is enabled
to discern these Myster^es of Godliness; bue yet the object lie's in the dark,
the Gospel therefore reveale's it unto them; as the Kingly Prophet most
punctually phras^th it, Psalm 36.9. in thy light we shall see light; in the
light of the Spirit we shall see the light of the Gospel; and yet these two
are very distinct; nay my Text confute's all; for if there be any thing in this
Verse, which look's like the Gospel, it is the words of the voice, thou art my
beloved Son, etc. the apparition of the holy Ghost, in the likeness of a dove,
has nothing to do with the Gospel, therefore the Spirit here cannot be taken
for the Gospel; but they urge again, that it is called the Gospel of the
Spirit, 2 Cor* 3 6. I say, therefore it is not the Spirit, it is the Gospel of
the Spirit, because it reveale's the Spirit unto us and Spiritual Mysteries;
but nothing is the same with that which it reveale's; nay, if we say any thing
is of another, we must in that imply, that it is not that other.

Sect. 3.
But they go farther, and say, that this phrase, the holy Spirit, signifie's
Dei Donum, which is given to certain men, Not the gift of God to certain men,
but by a figure.
and is called the earnest of our inheritance; no doubt, and he cite's 2 Cor.
1.22. as Ephesians 1.14. all this is granted, that the holy Spirit is taken
sometimes for the Gifts, but by a Metonymie, the cause for the effect; but that
it should never be taken for that Divine person, we deny, and they cannot
prove; for, as St. Paul dispute's the case at large, 1 Cor. 12. The gifts of
the spirit are diverse, but the same Spirit, that third person of the Trinity,
is one; so that although the Spirit may be called by the name of those Gifts
which proceed from it, yet he is distinct from them, and here it is evident in
my Text, he was another thing besides them. This is all that I find objected;
and all this is confuted out of this, where the holy Spirit is said to descend
upon our Savior in the likeness of a dove, to which none of these extravagant
expressions can be applied. And now, there needs no more from Scripture; Their
great defiance to us, A defiance to them that call for Reason in these
mysteries.
to produce Reason for what we speak, may be defied by us as unnecessary in a
Case of Faith; where we have Scripture we must believe beyond, yea against
reason; the Scripture has been abundantly handled by diverse, although in
these places, which I have handled, I have endeavored to contribute something
to the clearing of them; The rational laid aside by all almost, as an
impossible work.

Sect. 4.
I therefore will adore and admire that high Mystery, and shall most humbly
thank Almighty God, that he has pleased to reveal such a sacred Truth to our
Faith, Which notwithstanding may be subservienr to Faith.
but then shall admire likewise his bounty to such men, whose Souls and Reason
he has awakened, by his Spirit, to such a height, as that they have made their
Reason attend their Faith and follow it, although non passibus aequis, yet come
up to it, and discern that it is most rational for a man to believe it is so;
What I have observed in this kind, and wherein I can enlarge the Conceit of
others, and explain any thing by reason, I shall set down (having this
occasion) and impart to the world, with all humility to more learned men and to
adoration of the Divine Excellencies, which are not to be fathomed by man, quid
sunt, what they are, although quod sunt, that they are; believing that they are
by faith, humane reason may justly strive to prove them, and certainly it is a
Godly work, as impious to labor against it; but I am discouraged mightily by
the whole body of the School, who almost with one voice, Thomist and Scotist,
cry out that it is impossible to be done.

Concerning God's enlarging the capacity of Nature, and admitting Reason to
some discovery of the Holy Trinity; Of Lullies Demonstration by Aequiparance;

Sect. 1.
C^rthag^na's l^tle less then blasphemous, intimating God's power of enlarging
the capac^ty of his Creature.
CArthagena is so impudent, that he affirme's, impossible est per Dei
potentiam fieri creaturam, cui sit naturalis cognitio mysterii Trinitatis; in
Thomam Quaest. 32. art* primo conclusione secunda. It is impossible that by the
power of God, a creature should be made, to whom the knowledge of the Trinity
should be natural; which, in my conceit, is little less then blasphemy; for
why cannot ^od make a Creature natural do that which he can enable him to do?
for these Terms, natural or supernatural, are only such, because God has
confined Nature to such bounds as it cannot go farther; and exalted other
things to such an height, as is ultra Sphaeram activitatis, beyond the reach of
that natural arm to come at; but, if it shall please God to enlarge the bounds
of that Nature, or draw the other nearer to it, it may then do that naturally,
which before, without that enlargement, it could not do; as we see that fire
cannot, with its heat, warm a thing which is far off, yet bring that body
nee^er to the fire, or let the fire be made more intense, it can then do it;
so can God make a Creature^s understanding more intense and active, and, if he
please, make that sun whose glorious light, in its self, we cannot behold, have
such gentle Clouds interposed, as may make us see him behind them, which in its
self nakedly, without those Clouds, we could not; so may God make himself
discernable by such expressions as were fit for him, and kindly to us; it is a
mighty fault in the great wits frequently, that they will limit God's abilities
to their own apprehensions, and because they cannot conceive how, therefore
they will say he cannot do it; and, because natural men, in this Condition,
cannot apprehend this, therefore God cannot make such a man; and so this
Author, whilst he labor's to show how divine excellencies transcend our
capacities, he himself confine's God's infinite power to his own fancy. But I
say, I have almost all against my undertaking, and therefore, before I go, I
will smooth the way, by disputing that question de possibilitate rei, whether
it be possible to be proved or no.

Sect. 2.
To understand which give me leave to preface somethings necessary to be
preconceived; first, What of God to be proved by Reason, and by whom to be
attempted.
we must know that there is a God; that this God is of an infinite excellency,
infinitely true, good, immense, eternal, etc. all which have a great consent
among Divines, that they may be proved by reason. Secondly, Consider with me
that there is a great difference betwixt these two; the man pretended able to
prove this by natural reason, who never heard nor apprehended it by faith; and
him who has assented to it first by faith; for the former has no reason to
enquire, or with industring to search, because those things of God only
concern him by which he is ruled, as his omnisciency, his justice, his
providence, and the like; but these internal excellencies which are only in
God, and only work as one principle in the outward works, concerning the
Creation or Government of the world, these he has no occasion further to busy
his Soul about; but then when they are revealed by faith, a contemplative Soul
ambitiously strive's how he may climb up to them by reason. These permitted, I
shall undertake the Question.

Sect. 3.
The first opposer, I meet with, is that great Father of the School, Aquinas's
first argument against the possibility to attain by natural reason any
knowledge of the Trinity.
Aquinas himself, who indeed has spoken as fully as any of his followers; his
discourse is in prima part Quest. 32 Art. primo in corpore: I answer (says
he) It must be said, that it is impossible, by natural reason, to come to the
knowledge of the Trinity of the divine persons; for it is proved before (which
is Quest. 12. Art 12. in corpore) that man, by natural reason, cannot attain
to the knowledge of God by the Creatures, but the Creature induce's to the
knowledge of God, as effects induce to the knowledge of the cause; that
therefore only can be known of God, which is necessary to be affirmed of him,
as he is the beginning and cause of the creatures, but the creative virtue of
God is common to the whole Trinity, therefore it appertaine's to the unity of
the essence, not to the Trinity of the persons. (Thus far he,) and this is
the first of his Arguments: I will answer them by degrees, one by one, for
perspicuity sake.

To this first I shall answer, that although the greatest part of knowledge is
either drawn from the cause to the effect, The Bishop's answer grounded upon
Lulli's demonstrat^on by aequiparance.
or from the effect to the Cause, and the first only can be applied to God,
who has no cause, and whose effects some way or other, all things are; as from
that one infinite being, God, yet Raymund Lully, whom I most honor, in this
case, has thought of other ways of arguing, of as great force and convincing
a man's understanding as these, to wit demonstratio per aequiparantiam, by the
proportion and equality of things, and per similitudimem, by their likeness,
that by equiparance or equivalence he conceives to be, when by one or two of
an equal excellency an other quality is proved to be as excellent; as thus;
because God is infinitely excellent, therefore he is infinitely knowing,
infinitely good; again this argument from equivalence may be brought from the
power to the acts, thus; the act is proportioned to he power; where is an
infinite power, there is an infinite act; where a finite power, there but a
finite act; now by these ways I apprehend that a man may prove the Trinity,
although not by the effects of God in the Creature, as effects.

Sect. 4.
His second Argument is, that to prove the Trinity by reason were derogatory
from faith, Aquinas's second Argum.
which is of things invisible, as it is Heb. 11. now, says he, if these things
were proveable by reason, they were not unseene, that is of natural
understandings.

To this I answer, that from the same inconvenience, the infinite creating
power and act of creating were not proveable by reason, which is an article of
our faith, The Bishop's first answer concerning the invisible objects of Faith.
and although we could not prove it, yet we must believe it, which both he and
his followers agree to grant.

Secondly, I answer, that although these things of faith are unseen by mere
natural men, without all faith, The Bishop's second answer concerning the
after-sight of Reason.
yet when a man has faith, then that light of faith, may show him this or that
thing of them, and his Reason may afterward likewise discern it; for you may
conceive a weight too heavy for a weak man to lift, yet when a stronger
assist's him, he can do it with him which before he could not without him; or
as you may see a weake-sighted man, by the help of his Spectacles, reade's
those words, which else he could not have read without them, yet having clearly
read them with Spectacles can after, by his weaker sight, read them without,
because the sense is in his head; so a man who, by his own weak sight of his
own reason, cannot lift such a burden as the Trinity, yet having the
assistance of a stronger, his faith, he can then lift up his Arm of Reason, to
bear it likewise; so he that was forced to use spectacles assistants to his
Reason, whereby he might apprehend this Mystery, yet having the sense of it in
his head, by that, can afterward read it by reason; so, though these holy
Mysteries are invisi^le to mere natural men, yet, when made apparent by faith,
they may afterward be discerned likewise by Reason.

His third argument from scorn and scandal.
Another argument is, that it is unprofitable to faith, for (says he) when men
use reasons that are not convincing, they fall into the scorn of incredulous
men, who think that our faith is built upon such reasons only; I answer,
Answered by the adherence to infallibility of Scripture.
this cannot be with such as I, who profess that my faith depend's upon the
Scripture, which is infallible, yet have lifted up my Reason to work upon, and
serve that Faith.

Sect. 5.
Trigosius and Carthagena passed by.
I thought to have examined Trigosius and Carthagena, but I find little in them
which will not abundantly be satisfied in my following discourse; I shall let
them pass therefore, and for this instant, be contented with what has been
written; only let the Reader observe, that truth is not opposed to any truth,
Truth not opposed to Truth.
the truth of Faith, to the truth of Reason, divine to humane, nor does Grace
destroy, but perfect Nature; nor only enlighten the Soul to apprehend, but to
see; and enable's the Reason to discern what else it could not.

I have here observed diverse Authors undertaking this work, as first Richardus
de Sancto victore in his third Book de Trinitate, cap. 2.3, 4. then
Bonaventure, in 1. senten. Disp. 2. but he had ill luck with his Argument, for
his own Disciples forsake him here, as Corialanus and Trigosius, Scotus
likewise somewhat; but all their discourses have been answered, I conceive,
satisfactorily; only Raymund Lully, The Bishop close^h with Raymund Lully,
whom he vindicateth against Vasques.
I think passes unsatisfied, though undertaken by diverse; I shall not doubt,
therefore, with his assistance to make good my conclusions of Reason, that
there is a Trinity of persons in the unity of essence, Gabriel Vasques, in 1.
Question 32. Disput. 133. Dispute's against Lully, of whom he seems to have
read three Books, one called Apostrophe, another de Demonstratione
aquiparantiae; and Lib. sententiarum, I have no one of these, but three other,
his Ars magna, his Ars parva, and his Arbor Scientiarum, and I may add a
fourth, bound with his Arbor, called Introductorium, which furnish me with all
that he urges out of this Author and much more for this purpose; I deal with
him first, because other School men seem to derive what they know of Lully,
from him, and never to have seen his Books; so that, what shall be
satisfactorily spoken to him, will be sufficient for the rest.

I cannot but commend this Author for a noble enemy, because he speak's civilly
of his Adversary, which others do not, but rail at him, for an haeretick, with
opprobrious words, And Aymericus, who make's him an haeretick.
but he vindicate's him from that unworthy judgment of Aimericus a most
censorious unjust Inquisitor, in the fourth Chapter of his former Dispute,
where he said, that Raymund Lully, thought these demonstrations might be made
good against Saracens; I have not that particular passage in any of his Books,
but something like it, in his Arbor Scientiarum, in Arbore Apostolicali, cap.
de numero divinali aeternali, at the latter end of that Chapter, where he
says, that ( Dominus Papa and ejus fratres Cardinales) the Lord Pope and his
brethren the Cardinals should do well, His advice to the Pope and Cardinal
about convert^ng the Saracens.
if they would ordain certain holy men, devoted to dye for Christ, and learned
in the Arabic or Saracens language, who should go and preach to the Saracens,
and Dispute with them, showing them the Trinity, which Christians believe, etc.
and, at the last, by these means, the Pope and Cardinals would more exalt the
Catholic faith, then by sword or buckler, or any such like means;] so that, it
seems clearly, by this place, that he judged, as Vasques relate's; but more
then this I shall tell you, that (when (it seems) he could not get the Pope
and Cardinals to do it, Hi^ devout enterprise according to it, with success.
or perhaps they could not find out those persons and devout men which he
name's) he himself did undertake that work as, Hierome Sanches, who writ his
life, relates, and went amongst the Turks, and did convert diverse of their
Masters, which (says he) Ipsi vocant Alphochines, and being apprehended, the
first time was whipped, banished, and dismissed in a ship, but being one of
those devout men, who were resolved to dye for Christ, he went again to Bugis
in Tunis, His like adventure among the (...).
where the Moors had built Schools for the Education of youth in the Liberal
Sciences, where he converted many of the wisest to Christianity; to be brief:
the King caused him to be put into a loathsome prison, where, in hunger and
nastinesse, he remained seven months, and then being produced and examined he
professed himself a Christian, and ready to dye for Christ, Their cruel
sentence and execution frustrated by his strange deliverance.
upon which speech he was condemned to a Cave, and there to be overwhelmed with
Stones; which Sentence his Executioners acted most cruelly, leaving him, as
they thought, dead; but some Merchants stole him away by night, and shipped him,
and, by contrary winds, he was driven to the Baleares Insulae, and dyed
fourscore years old, in the year of the Lord* 1315. Now let Bernard,
Lathenburgensis, Petrus Gallisardus, Aymericus, Faber Faventinus, with other
his flanderers, show me any amongst them of more Christian excellency and
piety, in that age, then this man, whom they call haeretick; I dare hardly say,
The notable effect of his sufferings.
if he were an haeretick, (nothing like which I see in his Books) yet that Love
which does, with God, hide a multitude of faults, ought to conceal likewise his
faults with men, and this love and charity toward God, of his, might excuse
almost any thing; this Baptismus Flaminis, as the Schools call it, this trial
by Fire, as St. Peter. But so much for the defense of my Author, to whom I
confess my self much beholden; now to the Argument which I undertake to defend.

Sect. 6.
Vasques put's Raymund's undertaking to consist of three propositions; first,
Lully's undertaking according to V^sques.
that there are diverse persons in the Trinity; secondly, that they are no
more, nor no less, then three; thirdly, that these are the Father, Son and
holy Spirit. Vasques likewise says, that Raymundus undertake's to prove these
per demonstrationes aequiparantiae; and he expound's it right, what that
aequiparance is, according to one branch, which is the equivalence of the
things; but he left out the other, which I set down before, that is, the
equivalence betwixt the power and the effect; Whose Arguments he recite's and
forme's.
Next he come's to his particular Argument, his first is (says he) where is
Concord there is plurality, but in the divine Goodness there is Concord,
therefore there is plurality. The major (says Vasques) he leave's unproved,
The first prove's a personal plurality by concord.
but his minor he prove's thus; Where is an act, there is Concord betwixt the
Agent and the thing produced, But, in the Divine Goodness there is an act,
which is bonificare, to make good, Therefore, there is Concord. And then
Vasques produces another Argument of the some nature; Another from equality,
distinction.
Wheresoever is equality, there is a distinction between the two equals, But
in the Divine Goodness there is an equality ( to wit, betwixt the good thing it
self and that which is made good) Therefore there is distinction; to this he
answer's.

These are not demonstrations, because they suppose that which is not to be
granted by Reason, Vasques's first Answer, excepting against the supposi^ion of
a real effective act in God.
nor evident, but by Faith, which is, that there is a real act in God, which
should be by production (that is (I think) should produce an effect) for (says
he) although it may be proved by n^turall Reason, that God does understand and
will, and so in God is an act and operation; yet by no certain demonstration,
can it be proved, that he should so understand and will, that these acts should
produce; and unless Faith did teach us this, we should say, that these acts
are his substance, not operations, and are only conceived of us as operation.
The Bishop's R^ply, that Lul^y not only supp^s^d but proved it.
This is his first answer, to which I shall reply, that, although I am
persuaded that that learned Jesuit had found no such thing in the Books he had
read of Lully's, yet I have found, in those I have with me, an ample proof of
that proposition, which he affirm's can^o^ be set out by Reason, which is, that
there is a real act, which must be a production; for which first I shall cite
his arbor quaestionalis, de quaestionibus dignitatis Dei, where the question is
put, ut^um productio si^ in Deo, whether there be any production in God; his
Solutio is, If there be no production in God, then Omnes rations, all his
[reasons] is the word, (but I may call them (as he does elsewhere) all the
forms, all such things, as we affirm knowingly to be in God) should be idle
in an infinite extension and infinite duration; Give me leave, Reader, to
explain this, for it is a reigning Disease amongst great Artists, that in high
notions they do impose new Terms, which do amaze a Reader; but more pardonable
in him, who, having run through all Arts and Sciences, write's them for his own
Scholars, which, he supposes, understand his language; to explain him then,
His Lordship's explanation of Lully's sense by the necessity of God's acting
somewhat from all eternity or being idle, which could not be.
as well as I can, to such as are not acquainted with his Books, the sense is
this; If in God should be no production, then all his Attributes were useless
in an infinite extension of place, and an infinite duration of time; I use
these terms, although God's immensity infinitely exceed's place, his eternity
all time; and the reason of this may be, because we conceive a most unlimited
nothing beyond this world, and most unconceiveable eternity, when this world
was not, and shall not be; now (says he) if there should be no internal
production in God, there would be an infinite vacuity, in which was no
production, and an infinite time, in which there was none; and then, in all
that vacuity and duration, God were idle, and produced nothing, which were
little less then blasphemy for a natural man to say; for he observe's that
there is nothing unactive in the whole beings of nature; and the more excellent
any thing is, the higher it growe's in action, and the more noble the effects;
it must be so in God then, unless we conceive something unworthily of him.
This I apprehend to be the sum of that Argument; but he turne's me to the
Dignities, and Flowers of his Arbor Divinalis; for the Dignities I find
reckoned God's goodness and greatness, which we call his immensity, his
eternity, etc. new (says he) all these have their effects; his Goodness
produces that which is good; his immensity that which is such; his eternity
the like, etc. in all his other Dignities; and all these being essential^y in
God, yea God, as he speak's often, there is necessity that either eternally he
must produce somewhat, or be idle; Thus, I think, I have made good this
proposition against Vasques his first answer; that there must be some effect
produced; but he has another answer.

Sest. 7.
Again (says he) his reason to prove that there is an act of production in
God, Vasques charge Lully with a m^stake of a formal cause for an efficient.
Who is m^staken by him*
is because he is bonificativum, bonificare and bonificabile, that is, making
good, and the act to make good, and the thing made good; this (says he) is
frivolous, for (says he) this act is not that which Faith teaches to be the
production of a person, and a rational operation, but it is a certain act not
of an efficient or producing cause, but of a formal cause, as we say,
whiteness make's a thing white.

By his leave, first, I find he has read more in Lully his Arguments then he
set down, or else he could not have urged this now, for proof of that which
(he said) before he left unproved; Secondly, the proposition to be proved was
not, that there was a production of a person, for that was the conclusion
before to be proved, and this, that there was a real production, was the
medium from whence that will follow; for, if there be an eternal production,
it must be another essence, or an other person; the first is impossible,
therefore the second must be; and then lastly I answer, that bonification, And
the cause proved no less efficient then formal.
as making good, is not only taken for a form, but an efficient Cause, which
may be thus proved, first from God's goodness, and the infinite excellency of
it; now goodness, in its own nature, is communicative, in morality; a good
rich man give's more then a poor good man; a good wise man communicate's his
wisdom, etc. In nature it is an excellence of fire not only that it is warm
in it self, but that it communicate's this warmth to other things; of the Sun,
not only that it is light, but that it does enlighten; of any thing, that it
is good, and that it does communicate that goodness; so then, see if Nature
do not teach us, that, if God be an infinite Good, he must communicate and
produce an infinite good; thus may we discourse from his infinite power; if
good and powerful both, then why should he not produce some infinite effect
that is infinitely good? for else his power should be without an act
proportionable; let no man talk of this world, this was made in time, and there
would have been an infinite duration without it, or that he might make other
works before it, they must be all in time; besides that, they are finite
things* which do not, cannot extend themselves to the expression of such an
infinite excellency; and then, let me urge from that other medium
aequiparantiae, before spoken of: powers are known by their act, and by their
object; all the world acknowledges God to have an infinite power; where is the
infinite act the infinite production? and then conceiving that this infinite
goodness and power are eternal, this production must needs be such if at all,
because else there would be a duration in which this power were not produced
into act, in which this goodness produced no good. Thus far I think I have
vindicated Lully and the conclusion, out of invincible reason, that there is a
plurality of persons, it must needs be that God eternally produced some
infinitely good effect, which, because it cannon be another essential God,
must be another person; If you would have thi^ discourse drawn into a perfect
Syllogism, The discourse drawn into perfect syllogism prov^ng the eternal
plurality of persons by production.
take it thus:

That which is infinite in power, goodness, immensity, eternity, perfection,
must produce such an effect eternally;

But God is infinite in power, etc.

Therefore God must produce an effect correspondent.

The major only needs proof; the minor is granted even by Saracens: and I
prove the major thus;

That eternal thing, whose power can never be idle, must produce an effect
correspondent to it self eternally;

But that which is infinite in power, goodness, and the like, is such a thing
which can never be idle;

Therefore it must produce such an effect eternally.

The major is evident, because, if it be eternal, and never idle, it must
produce something, or else its act is in vain; and it being infinite, it must
produce an infinite effect, or else the infinity is idle; we see fire, or every
thing else, the more intense it is, the greater effect it produces; and thence
climb up by degrees to infinite, we shall find that infinite must needs produce
an infinite effect.

I will only then prove the minor thus.

That which is infinitely perfect must not only have a lazy power which does
nothing (for that is an infirmity for a power not to act) but must work
accordingly.

But God is infinitely perfect (as is granted by all even Saracens) Therefore
he must not have this power idle and act nothing. Let any man enquire, why any
power does not work, it must needs be answered, because the Agent cannot, or
will not; to say God cannot, is to deny the infinity of his power, for that
power is not infinite, which can be restrained; and to say he will not, does
both destroy his goodness and perfection; his goodness, because goodness is
diffusive, it is no^ goodness else; and infinite goodness must be infinitely
d^ffusive: his perfection, because it is a greater perfection, to be, and work
accordingly, then to be, only; he therefore must needs act this infinitely
excellent work eternally; and for my part, I see no reason why a man may not
think, that Lully, upon such grounds as this, might convert to this first
foundation of the Trinity, that God the Father did eternally produce an
infinitely excellent work like himself. I have considered with my self what
may logically be objected against this, The Objection urging, the Angel cannot
produce the like effect answered*
and I find nothing of moment, but that Angels do not, cannot produce such an
effect, which are the Creatures the nearest and likest to God of any; and my
answer is, that they do not, because they cannot; and they cannot, because
they have limited natures which are confined; but God is infinite, without
limitation; if they could* they would; but all things that are amongst us,
which have vestigia Dei, the footsteps of God, do teach us this, and therefore
by reason we ought to think so of God; This may suffice for the first
conclusion, that there are diverse persons in the God head, to wit one person
generating or producing, and another generated or produced.

Sect. 8.
Vasqu^s's satisfact^^y answer^ to Lully's arguments for his second Conclusion.
The second conclusion, which Vasques charge's Raymund Lully with, is, that he
will prove by reason, that there are three persons; which is in his second
chapter of his 132. Disp. where before; he produces Raymund's Argument, I am
persuaded, truly according to these books he read of his; and he give's
satisfactory answers to what he produces out of Lully; I will not tire the
Reader with what one or the other speak's there, be^cause I build not upon
those grounds expressed in that chap. but upon others, which I shall produce
out of Raymund Lully in those books I have of his.

The Bishop proceed's upon other grounds of his to prove the Trinity.
It is granted by all the Schools, and all that have written any Theology,
whether out of Scripture or Reason, that God is infinite and without
Composition, most single and one; that in him, not as an accident is in a
subject, but modo eminentiori, after some divine manner, transcending our
Capacities, God's infinite Simplici^y and Uni^y.
is both understanding and will; these being in him, or rather being himself,
must be infinite.

This is the first foundation upon which I build, and it is a rock which
hitherto has been shaken with no winds of opposition. The second is like unto
it: That since there is a production by God, who is most single and one most
spiritual, this production must be by some spiritual not corporeal Faculty; and
these are but those two other formerly spoken of, His spiritual faculties
Understand^ng and Will.
understanding and will; the unders^anding of God must be infinite, and that
infinite understanding must be fitted with an infinite object; for, unless it
be infinite, it cannot be divine, because whatsoever is divine is infinite; an
infinite object it must have, because else an infinite faculty should be in
vain, at the least in Degrees, that is, it should not have an equal object to
employ it self about; Himself the infinite obj^ct of his Understanding.
this infinite object can be none but himself; for as whatsoever is God must
needs be infinite, so whatsoever is infinite must needs be God. They are
converted; now then thus I argue:

God must needs know himself infinitely, eternally; Which is eternally
productive of his internal Word.
or else there would be some Duration or nunc in which he did not know himself;
this knowledge of himself produces his internal Word, as I have spoken
heretofore, that is, the conceit, the expression of himself; It must needs be
so; for whatsoever is understood has, at that instant in which it is
understood, an express image or character of it self, in that understanding
which apprehend's it; well then, it must necessarily be, that God understanding
himself eternally must needs have the expression of himself fully, wholly, with
all his infinite perfections which belong to him; but now because in men and
Angels, which have a composition in their essence, yea of substance and
accident, there their actual understanding is an act, that word, or image, or
character, which is produced by that act, is another in^entional accident; but
in God it cannot be so, he has no composition, he is made up of nothing, but
is purely himself; his act of understanding is substantial, his word is
substantial, all the same with himself, all divine, all God; And that word
subst^^ti^^, the same with himself.
therefore this product of this act of his understanding must be God, God of
God, yet another person; the same person cannot be the producer and the
produced, nor this produced be other then the same essence with the producer,
for it must be infinite, have all the attributes the producer has, or else it
is not a complete understanding, it will be short in somewhat. Nay, I remember
Lully, where before cited, says, Because God is one, and every form (as he
call's them) must be operative, even his unitas must be communicated, and unio
must have uni^e (he mean's unif^cere) must make one, as well as be one: (but of
this more hereafter.) But if it have all, it must have the Deity, which in
essence can be but one; thus we may conceive the production, which is before
spoken of, to be the word of God, as St. John, the character or express image
of his person, as St. Paul Heb. 1.3. for nothing can be a more express image of
another then that which is the word of it, for that, if it be a true word,
fully expresse's the being of it. The Bishop guided to this discovery by
Scripture as the Wisemen by a S^ar.
And hitherto, I think, I have showed the manner of this production to be most
rational, as the Scripture has steered and guided me. The wise men, who came
to worship our Savior at his birth, found him, but could never have thought
upon seeking him, much less of seeking him in a Stable in Bethlehem, but that a
star guided them: It is somewhat like these men with me; I hope I have, by the
guidance of the glorious light of the Scripture, found this word, which without
that light I should never have done; and in this journey I have trod these
steps; I have showed, that such an infinite perfection, as God is, cannot choose
but produce something correspondent to that infinite excellency: I have showed
that this must be done by a spiritual act, which in the first place is his
understanding: how this is the place which this starlight of the Scripture
direct's us to: now I go about another work, which could not be raised but upon
this foundation.

Sect. 9.
God's Will as fruitful by love as hi^ Understanding by knowledge.
It appearing, that there are two spiritual faculties, Understanding and Will,
there is no reason to think, that the Understanding, which is most given to
contemplation, should be more fruitful then the Will, which is in its own
nature most active; let us therefore consider the producent and the product,
him that understand's, and that Word, which is the product of that
Understanding, to be two distinct, with equal infinite excellencies, and all
those perfections, which are in the producer, to be in that which is produced,
those perfections infinite, it is not possible but that these must infinitely
love one the other; for a right* well-guided Will must needs affect with Love
that which is excellent and lovely, and so affect it, with such a proportion of
love as the object is lovely; therefore that which is infinitely lovely must
needs be infinitely loved; we men should love God infinitely, if the vessels of
our souls could contain so great a proportion of that heavenly oil of Charity,
the object God deserve's it; but either of these, being vessels infinite,
cannot be deficient for lack of love, but can have as much love as the object
is lovely, which is infinite; well then, it must needs be, that these two, the
producer and the produced, must love one another infinitely, and delight
infinitely in one another, the Father in such a Son, the Son in such a Father;
this love, with which they affect one another, cannot be an accident, there is
none such in God, it must be a substance therefore; nor can it be another
substance from the Deity, And so productive of a third person, which is
likewise God.
both because nothing is infinite but the one only true God, and likewise
because there is no composition, either accidental or substantial in God, but
whatsoever is in God is God; this therefore must be such, so that the first
production being granted, that there are two persons, a producing person and a
produced, both infinitely excellent, it must follow that there must be a third.

Sect. 11.
But now, why no more, may be asked, and my answer is, These divine productions
not to be multiplied, because infinite, by which an objection's answered.
that those two faculties act infinitely, according to their manner of acts,
and having acted infinitely, it is not possible to conceive that there should
be any progress beyond that which is infinite, and therefore one word
infinitely produced by the Understanding in an infinite perfection; one Love
likewise proceeding infinitely from these which are infinite; in other acts of
men, or Angels, multitude make's addition, because they are finite; but in
these, they would argue an imperfection, as if there were not enough acted
before, these three therefore, and no more. If you desire this in a logical
Form: An infinite product cannot be other then a person of the Trinity; But the
product of that infinite Love betwixt these two persons is an infinite product,
Therefore that must be a person of the Trinity.

The major in this syllogism stand's upon its (...) legs, for if it be
infinite it must be God, if it be God, either essentially or personally, not
essentially, because the essence of God can no way be truly said to be
produced, being the fountain of all production, therefore it must be taken
personally, that a person is produced; The minor will be proved most certain*

That product, which is equal to that which is infinite, is infinite; But the
product of the Love of these two infinite persons is equal to that is
infinite, Therefore, etc.

The major is clear, because what is equal to that is infinite, must be
infinite* or else it is not equal; The minor is thus proved; Where the object
loved is infinite, and the lover infinite, there the product of that Love must
be proportioned; But it is so here, the Divine Excellencies for the object, and
the Divine persons the lovers or the Agents; Therefore it is not possible for a
a man to conceive it other, then that it must be infinite, and another person
from the other two, for the same cannot be the producer and produced in respect
of the same; another infinite essence it cannot be, it must therefore be
another person.

Sect. 12.
But I know it is often objected here by the Assertors of the Greek Church; It
cannot be, The objection made by the Assertors of the Greek Church answered,
according to the sense of the Catholic, touching the procession of the holy
Ghost.
that the product of these two Agents should be one and the same person, since
it come's from two, no more then two heates proceeding from two fires should be
one. I will not here debate School-niceties, which I abhor in such Mysteries
as these, where a man cannot speak truth but with danger, as St. Augustine
somewhere; but I could tell you of many Schoolmen, and those most learned,
that affirm, although this Love come from two persons, yet it is, as they are,
one and the same essence; but I dread to teach any thing unrevealed by the
Scripture, as it is expounded by the Catholic Church, and that is, that the
holy Ghost, which is but one, proceeded from both persons; the manner I dare
not pry into, which is unrevealed, and therefore, for answer, say, that as you
may see two fires or Candles (if you will) whilst severed, produce two heates,
Illustrated by a similitude to facilitate in part our apprehension of it.
two lights, yet join these two fires or two Candles together, they are but
one, though more intense; yea conceive them a little severed, when and where
they meet in their operations with their heat or light, they unite in that
quality, and in the product, the effect, they produce in the object, so it is
with these; they proceed from two persons united in the same essence; they
affect the same object, the same divine perfections, and these two affections
join together in one holy and divine flame of Love, complacence, joy, and
unspeakable happiness, one in each other, which, being the fullness of infinite
happiness, cannot be other then one and the same. Thus, methinks, although we
affirm Love to proceed from these two persons as two persons, yet we may well
apprehend how they may, in this substantial act, be only one. And now, I hope,
I have finished this second undertaking; that those persons are three, the
first person that speak's this internal word, the second the Word that is
spoken, the third this infinite Love, Joy, Delight, Comfort, that these two
have one in another; more cannot be imagined, because we can find but two
spiritual faculties in the Divine essence, by which it can produce any thing,
that is, Understanding and Will; and in this notion they have both an infinite
production, which is the furthest any operation can extend it self; and
therefore though consequent productions of creation may be like sparks of the
same fire, afterward produced to give God an external glory, yet no other
internal operation, which is infinite, but these two. And now I may apply my
self to the third proposition, that these three persons are the Father, the
Son, and the holy Spirit.

Sect. 13.
First, for the Father and the Son, these two relatives cannot be one without
the other; How the three Divine Persons must necessarily be Father, Son, and
Holy Spirit.
and it is evident, out of that which has been said, that the producer and
produced must be Father and Son; for although, perhaps, we cannot properly say,
that when fire produces its like, that product is the son of the fire; nor,
perhaps, when we see a plant or beast do it, can we say, that that product is a
son; yet when we see any thing, that is rational, do it, we may most properly
say, that it is the producer's son; now, that God is such, can be no question,
therefore in this production there is a Father, and a Son; for God being most
spiritual, we must expect only a pure spiritual propagation, which can be
conceived no way so ^itly, as by the Understanding, nor indeed is possible; and
here, in this expression, we find all those notions, in which the same is
delivered to us in Scripture, to be clearly evident, as that he is the Word,
the internal Word of God, the image of God; no image so clear as that which is
drawn in the word of any thing, the internal word fully expressing that of
which it is the word; so likewise the wisdom of God, because it is the relict
of divine knowledge, because it is the highest principle and first fountain of
all other beings; and for the third person, the doubt can only be whether he
is holy, or whether a person; and indeed there can be no doubt of either,
because he is God, and then he must be most spiritual, and most holy. So that
that 3. Proposition is as clear as the former, that these persons are the
Father, Son and holy Spirit: I thought to have vindicated Raymund Lully from
Faber Faventinus, who, being a Scotist, I thought in his Natural Theology had
written something various from Vasques, but he deserve's pity, having no
knowledge of Lully but by Vasques, and, what is worse, when Vasques excuses
Lully from that opprobrious scandal of being an Heretic, he, who knew nothing
of him, but in Vasques, falls upon him with that foul and disgraceful Term,
and endeavour's not to answer Vasques his vindication of him.

Sect. 14.
It may be justly enquired now, why we should call these three persons, since
they are not so termed in Scripture. This question was debated by S. Augustine
long ago, Why they are called three persons* being no Scripture Language, and
^ow, long ago, debated by St. August^ne.
in his 7. book de Trinitate, cap. 4. and, methink's, satisfactorily, in the
which he has these passages; first, Since the Father is God, the Son God, and
the holy Ghost God, why are there not three Gods? He that says the Scripture
does not call them three Gods, and therefore he dare's not, answer's himself,
for neither does the Scripture call them three persons. He had showed before,
that the Scripture says, that there is one God, and that these three are
called God; but as he had showed, that although the Scripture does not say,
that there is one essence of God, yet we believe confidently, there is but one
essence; so may we do of these persons; take this phrase, Propterea licuit,
disputandi necessitate, tres personas dicere, non quia Scriptura dicit, sed
quia Scriptura non contradicit: he says, That the necessity of Disputation
make's a man say something, which is not against Scripture, in this point; and
that is enough, for if the Scripture express that there are three, and that
loquendi causa (as he speak's at the beginning of that chapter) de
ineffabilibus ^ari aliquo modo possumus quod ^ffa i nullo modo p^ssumus; That
(says he) we may say somewhat of these unspeakable things, which we cannot
clearly speak out in full and significant terms, we speak thus: And again in
the same chap. Excedit supereminentia Divinitatis usitati eloquii facultatem;
verius enim cogitatur Deus, quam dicitur; and ve^ius est, quam cogitatur; the
result of which is this, that the thoughts of man are short of the Divine
perfections, and the language of man short of his thoughts; because our
language being formed to our usual business, which we converse about, all which
are excelled infinitely by the divine perfections, they must be short in their
expressions of those divine excellencies: And therefore again that most
excellent and learned man in the same chap. Quid igitur restat, nisi ut
fateamur loquendi necessitate parta haec vocabula? and indeed they are the most
significant which can be found out; for since we conceive that this term person
is the last actuality and addition which can be made to any reasonable
substance, it may most justly be applied to this of the Trinity and each
distinct suppositum thereof; but still with this reservation, that the Divine
things are ineffable and not fully to be conceived, much less expressed by us;
say God's essence is thus, or thus, we may; but to say, that that language,
whatsoever it be, does fully express his essence, or being, is a presumption in
any man; and the like, and no otherwise, of these personalities, it is the
nearest expression man can make, and let us be contented with it. A second
question may be, The extent or limits of this personal disti^ction the Bish^p
^eve^ently forbear's to determ^ne.
whether this personal distinction in the Trinity be a main and great
difference, or some little and inconsiderable thing: For answer to this, my
humility and adoration of the Divine persons is such, that I dare affirm
positively nothing in the world, which is not expressed in the holy Scripture;
a relation we are sure there is, by which the one is signified to us and not
the other, as the Father, the Son, and the holy Spirit proceeding from them,
which spiration signifie's a procession, which always involve's a person
proceeded, and a person from whence it proceeded; and these relations must
needs be founded in some substance; when we consider them in God, who has no
accident, but what difference is in that foundation the Scripture is silent, I
am at a maze, whether infinite, bccause whatsoever is in God is infinite, and
therefore some may conceive it such; but then they must make the unity in God
infinite likewise, because that is most primarily affirmed in him, and yet both
may be in him, though they seem impossible in us, whose perfections excel our
thoughts, as much as these irreconciliable things amount unto; and therefore
here I could, with Mr. Hobbes, And disl^ke's the rash curiosity of the
Schoolmen.
declaim bitterly against the School, who so boldly intrude their busy Wits
into the unsearchable things of God, by rashly, according to their imagination,
determining twenty, yea an hundred, things about the Trinity, which God has
not revealed, and yet lazily sitting still, and not endeavoring to make their
understandings mount up to those things which God has revealed; it is a most
virtuous industry in man, to make his Reason wait upon Faith as close as it
can; but it is an effect of a most busy and presumptuous undertaking, to
adventure to pry into that Ark, which God has concealed and hid; as I have
attempted the one, so I have abstained from the other.

Sect. 15.
But yet, perhaps, I may be censured for undertaking to handle this question by
reason, His Lordship's apology for undertaking to handle the question by reason.
which has been so generally denied by the School; to which I have already
given an answer; but farther; although the generality of the School have
deserted this debate, yet many men of high learning have undertaken it, as not
only the mighty Lully, but that learned Cusanus in two Books of his de visione
Dei, cap. 17. and 18. as likewise de cribratione Alchoran, lib. 2. cap. 2.
usque ad 12. and aliis locis; so likewise Raymundus de Sabu^di in his Theologia
naturalis, cap. 47. and sequentibus, Dionysius Carthusianus de fide catholica,
lib. 2* Petrus Pasnonie^sis i^ his decisiones Theologica speculativae and
morales, lib. 1. cap. 4. quaest. 1. conclusione 1. who think his and Scotus his
reason in that place unanswerable; some things likewise in Richardus de Sancto
victore and others, by reading of which Author's a man may discern what I have
excerpted, and what added.

But yet I may seem to have neglected Antiquity in seldom or never quoting the
Fathers; And seldom quoting the Fathers.
for this I can give diverse reasons; first, my Genius does detest that foolish
ostentation; and secondly, the use of it is unnecessary in this Controversy,
where neither Mr. Hobbes, nor the Socinians, with whom I have to do, make any
esteem of that Argument from such Authority; and thirdly, besides that it has
been long since laboriously done by the mighty industry of Bernardus Paxillus
de Buzezeb, concerning the first four Centuries (whether he went further I know
not) which is enough in this Controversy, the latter Ages having been secured
from these questions by the decrees of Councills, and harmony of the Universal
Church consenting with them, until Ochinus, or Socinus, unhapp^ly awaked them
again.

Reader, A digression to the Reader.
once before I printed my Observations upon 12, 13, 14. Chapters of this Book,
then, when it was in the Press, I found one Argument, which I had urged in the
matter of Religion, opposed in another Book by Mr. Hobbes, which became me to
satisfy, the false printing of that make's me reprint it now; and when that,
and the rest, were ready for the printer, I find now again a Latin Book
printed at Amsterdam, Entitled, Epistolica dissertatio de principiis justi and
decori, continens Apologiam pro tractatu clarissimi Hobbaei de cive, wherein
are diverse things contrary to that which I have observed upon his 13. and 14.
Chap. and therefore in the second edition conceive my self bound to vindicate
my D^scourse from what is objected against it, which I here endeavor.

CHAP. XXXVI.
Concerning preservation of life, and preference of public interest. Of
Faculties, Passions, and Parts subservient to the guidance of Reason.
Particular men can have no universal right being limited in their proprieties
and pretenses. The danger of allowing it, and not allowing the right of
Occupancy.

Sect. 1.
Select Aphor^smes out of which the Author draw's his Discourse.
IN the 9. page of this Treatise he supposes a God, which I like well; and that
he created the world in wisdom; and that he will exercise the virtues of
justice, and truth in the government of it; These are well supposed; he draw's
from hence, that God proposed to himself some end in this creation, (I will
dispute nothing which may be granted) to which some fitting means are disposed.

Secondly, that those means in themselves ought to have an aptitude to the
procuring that end.

And thirdly, that a man shall be blessed, or punished, according as he uses
or neglect's these means; These are in the 9. and 10. pages. Then in the 14.
page he deduceth, that that, whatsoever in its own nature hinder's the
attaining that end, which was intended by Nature, is forbidden; As likewise,
whatsoever is in its own nature so disposed, as without it the end intended by
Nature cannot be attained, this is commanded.

Again he says, that there are many things which, not from their own nature,
but from outward circumstances do acquire the fitness or opposition to the end,
and these are permitted by the Law of Nature, and of such consist's the Laws of
men. This page 16.

These are the chief Aphorisms, out of which he draw's his whole Discourse;
and, not to trouble the Reader with any unnecessary quarrels, I will come to
the application of these generals, which we may find page 32. and not meddle
with any of these rules, unless some urgent occasion make's me look back upon
them; in that 32. page he thus discourses; A good foundation of his to build
upon.
I contemplating my self as part of the world, it must needs be that not by
chance, but by the Counsel of the most prudent and wise God, I am brought
forth. This was an excellent foundation to build upon, but, to consider what I
shall observe hereafter the better, remember that he contemplated himself, not
only in relation to himself, but as part of the world; we must therefore,
says he, examine what God would have done by me; a noble quaere, but remember,
His noble Quae^e.
that this must be here made by the word of God or Scripture (which he
forewarned us of before) but by the rules of right Reason, what they should do
who have read no Scripture nor can; but have these principles only, that there
is a God, a Governor of the world, who will punish evil, and reward virtue. I
will go on with him.

Sect. 2.
That (says he) without doubt, God would have conserved in me which, if it be
taken away, he had in vain given me certain parts and proprieties;
Animadversions upon his ambiguous sense, touching the conservation of life.
There is a truth in that proposition, but we must consider this Phrase, God
would have conserved in me; I suppose he means by me; else if he mean it
absolutely, without doubt God intend's by the fabric of man, and many times by
his justice upon wicked men, not to conserve that man to whom he has given
many parts and proprieties, for no other purpose then to preserve his life.

Secondly, if he take it, as I think he does (for a conservation by that man
himself) it will be so far true only, that a man must preserve that life,
that being, in order to which those parts and proprieties were aimed, until
some greater good then that, at which those parts were directed, shall arise
out of the neglect of it; and this will be made good out of that contemplation
of his upon himself as part of the world; now a part must be lost rather then
the whole, a hand then a man, a finger then a hand, and so in all relation of
parts one upon another.

Sect. 3.
He goe's on page 33. above all things I find in my self a mighty study (summum
studium is his Phrase) his chief and principal study of keeping himself safe
and sound, His study of it as to his own particular.
as we may speak, salvum and incolumem are his words.

I believe him, he would never else have writ this Book; All men may not have
like reason to be so intent.
but although he do so, yet all men do not; for although there is in every man,
in every thing, a desire of being, yet some beings, to some men, are surrounded
with so many incommodities and troubles, that it is better not to be, then to
be such. I have treated of this in my censures upon the fourteenth Chapter of
Mr. Hobbes's his Leviathan, and in that handled his Book de corpore politico;
but because the language of this Gentleman does vary from Mr. Hobbes, and
therefore those expressions made there may not be applicable so perfectly to
him, I shall turn my self to this discourse before me.

To this study, says he, do serve the appetites of eating and drinking, of
revenge, the effects of love and grief, and, to conclude, all the passions of
the soul, and the whole fabric of the body. Yet, for all this, a beast, if he
could speak, might say as much for himself as this is (as I have showed before,
The parts and faculties of men not to be levelled with those of beasts.
) and it were strange if man's parts and faculties had no higher a design then
a beast's have; in the universe they, and all the rest, were made subservient
to man in this great world, and in this little world, man, no doubt, but they
are framed so likewise to be serviceable to that which is humane; and as God
has made man a Ruler over them, so those humane parts of reason and will to
govern these beastly sensual affections; and, it is as unseemingly, yea
unnatural, for a man's reason to subject it self to those passions and
sensual desires, as for a beast to govern a man.

You may observe a goodly Room in a house, The public interest to be preferred
and preserved before the personal or more private.
the timber, stones, gilding, or whatsoever adorne's it, are all made and
contrived for the necessity or beautifying that Room; yet it may hap, that
afterward that may be discerned to be unuseful, yea hurtful, to that house;
that Room must be plucked down, yea the house it self, when it shall offend the
street it stand's in, and the street, if noisome to the City, to which it
belong's; always the Lesser good, and privater interest, must submit to the
greater and more public benefit; so must it be with man and these parts, they
are useful to this man, this man to the City, that City to the Kingdom; when
we see these parts disposed to the advance and preservation of man's life, we
know man's life must be cared for, but not when a more public end of the City,
in which he live's, shall be prejudiced or hurt by it, and to this end indeed
God has given man reason, by which he may master his private and particular
desires, and rule and direct them to their more public end, so that then, in a
Logical discourse, we see his reason answered which was thus; That which has
so many passions, appetites, bodily parts subservient to it, must be preserved;
But the life of man, etc. ergo.

You may discern the answer ou^ of that has been already set down, that as
those passions, etc. are in themselves useful to man's life, so man's life is
useful to that City or Society where he live's; and as these passions are to
be refrained and kept under from ruling men's actions, when they, or either of
them, are hurtful to man's life, unto which in their creation they were
disposed; so man's life its self is not to be desired, but to be laid aside,
when it is useless or hurtful to that Society, or farther end, to which it was
intended; this, with what has been delivered against Mr Hobbes his 13. and 14.
Chapters, I think abundantly sufficient for answer to this Argument of his; I
will pass over many loose buildings, which he has raised upon this weak
foundation, but concern not me, and come now to page 98. where he enter's upon
another conclusion of Mr. Hobbes, which I have opposed in my piece upon the 14.
Chapter of Leviathan; and he begin's thus.

Sect. 4.
Since God has commended to me the integrity of my life and members, neither
can I for a little while preserve this life and breath without the use of
means, it follows, God has granted me a right to such means, without which
my life cannot be safe, for Qui dat jus ad finem dat jus ad media; he, who
give's a right to the end, give's a right to the means. What right a man has
to the m^a^s of preservi^g life, and how he is to use them.
] I am confident I have confu^ed his application of this rule, and expounded
the right sense of it, when before I writ of this very business, which was
obtruded by Mr. Hobbes in diverse things; but yet, for farther satisfaction,
Know that the right to the means is only out of that relation they have to the
end; if the end it self be not useful, much less the means; yea if obtaining
that and, by such means, does more hurt then good, those means are not to be
used; take an instance; A thirsty man desire's drink to quench his thirst, yet,
if his Physician find that that drink will increase his Fever, he must not
drink, the quenching his thirst, by such means, is worse then his Thirst; so to
preserve my life, by such means as do more harm then my life good, is not to be
done; of which kind there may be many, had this been urged for the whole
species of mankind, which is of so high a concernment in the Fabric of the
world, that the design of the whole relate's to it, then his Argument had
carried with it such a force as could not easily have been resisted; but when
it point's at particulars, which are inconsiderable parts of the whole, the
preservation of such is not to be husbanded against any public detriment.

Sect. 5.
Out of this he draw's the Axiom, The right of possession, and use of those
things belong's to me, which soever can yield me profit to the obtaining the
end of those things that, I have said above, God require's;

But when I may judge in a right and uncorrupted judgment, all the creatures in
the world can afford me that use;

Therefore I have a right to all.

Thus far he, whom I could well guess to be one of Mr. Hobbes his Disciples
by his manner of arguing; this he make's a syllogism, but there is not one
proposition which has a Logical form, nor is there a strong connection of one
with another.

His Axiom, or major, is false, because he supposes man, particular man, to
be the end of all the world.

Each particular man cannot pretend a right to the whole world.
For else how can the disposure of them to that end (a particular man's
advantage) entitle a man to have right unto them; Had this been affirmed by
Adam, or Noah, there had been some reasons for it, because they had a right to
each piece of the whole world; or had it been affirmed of mankind, the species
of man, it had a truth in it, because the world is ordered to the service of
that species; but when applied to any particular of that species, on any other
Sons of these Fathers of the world, it is of no force, for they have only
right to, and can only make use of their shares and particular proportions,
which are distributed to them by the Law's and Customs of the world, or of
those Nations wherein they live; nor are other things disposed to those
particular ends: God has entitled them no farther.

I can deny this proposition again out of my former ground; Nor to things
conducing only to mediate and particular ends.
a man has absolute right to those things which conduce to the last and
universal end, but not to those things which conduce to any mediate and
particular end, because that end it self may be useless; now God require's,
and Nature require's the more public to be advanced by the more private and
particular end; when that second is useless, the means in order to it are so
likewise, which have only an utility in order to it.

Sect. 6.
His minor he only suspected to be questioned, which is ( But when I may
judge, in a right and incorrupt judgment, all the creatures in the world can
afford me that use) And therefore he labor's with diverse arguments to confirm
it, which I shall examine, because I think them very erroneous; his first
reason is page 99. because (says he) singuli homines is his Phrase) single men
do lawfully use single creatures, neither is there any thing which is forbid
their use; now (says he) that which single men enjoy, any man may enjoy alone,
neither out of the cre^^tures part is there any contradiction.

These are Mr. Hobbes his own manner of disjoynted Discourses; the proposition
to be proved was, I can judge with a right and incorrupt judgment, all the
creatures in the world can afford me that use, that is, the preservation of my
life, and the contentments of it. That he prove's because, that single men do
lawfully use the single creatures; see if this be not just like to Mr. Hobbes
his reasonings; first he prove's, that I have a right to all things, because I
can judge that they may be useful to me; now he prove's, I may judge that they
may be useful to me, because single men use single creatures; for the
inconsequency of the first; The danger of pretending a right to all, and so
having a right judgment of it.
suppose a Son in prison for debt should judge, and truly judge, that by the
death of his Father his Father's estate would come to him, and by that he
should be released out of prison, had he right to kill his Father? by Mr.
Hobbes his rules, who says, that no man can divest himself of the right to
keep himself from such conditions which may render his life miserable, he may;
and by this Author, who fallows him close, he may, because he can truly judge
this is expe^^ent and useful for himself; the same may be said for Wives,
Children, for Kings; there may be found reasons why their destructions should
conduce to a private man's good; has he then a right to act those horrid
villainies? the first consequence must needs therefore be erroneous, which
judges of right only by the right judgment of the usefulness which it has
to the particular person; and the second no less, which judges the usefulness
to me, and a right in me to them, because other men enjoy them: for my part, I
should argue more truly clean contrary; because other men lawfully use them, I
cannot; two single men, at the same time, cannot lawfully use the same thing
with a propriety, Two cannot have a right to the same thing at the same time.
which imply's a negative to another; they may join in the same work, in using
the same Lever, to move a great weight; they may warm themselves by the same
fire; but have a right in the same thing they cannot, unless they be united
into some Corporation, whereby they are made one civil person, which were two
natural; but suppose he should mean, as he seems to do, that because no
particular thing is forbid any particular man, therefore a particular man has
right to every thing; All cannot be useful to one particular perperson.
to this I answer, that a particular man may have right to any particular
thing, yet not to all, out of his own principles, because all cannot be useful
to him, he is not able to make use of all; he that has right to eat any piece
of meat at the Table, yet has not right to eat all from other men, or to eat
all the meat there, it would surfeit him, although he, and every one at the
table may eat what he like's, and what he can civilly seize upon, fit and
proper for him: It is so with drinks; an hundred, or more, thirsty men come to
the same river, they can judge with an incorrupt judgment that it is fit for
them to drink, and every single man may drink any single part of that water,
yet no one or single person can judge it fit to drin^ up the river; it is so
with Clothes, Medicines, any thing that is useful to man; it fallows not
therefore, because single men can use these single creatures, therefore one
single person may use all of them; and this impossibility arises not only out
of the injustice used to other men, of which see disputes afterward, and I
shall follow him, but out of the disproportion the universe has to any
particular person, because it is too large; a finite hand can grasp no more
then the compass of it can contain; Nor every thing to ev^ry one.
and out of the qualities of it every thing is not convenient for every person;
he, who only is hungry, lacke's not cloths, etc. he, who is warm, lacke's not
a fire, and the like. I know it may be objected against this, that although
they are not useful now, yet they may be hereafter, and out of this forecast a
man may enjoy all the creatures useful and profitable for him now, or which
shall be hereafter. Of which no right judgment can be made for want of
knowledge.
I answer, they cannot, by a right judgment, think so, first because no man
know's them, not the hundredth, nor the hundred thousandth part of the single
creatures in the world, therefore he cannot judge they may be useful to him;
secondly, there are many things, the very kinds and species of which are not
known to any man, many fishes in the seas of the world, birds of the air, The
use of some known interdicted to whom hurtful.
and the like; many things, we know, would be hurtful to us, the scorching
heates of the torrid Zones to us Inhabitants in cold Countries; and our colder
would be as offensive to them, these cannot judge those other useful to them,
or that they will be useful to them at any time, which are averse to their
dispositions; so that although there be none of these things interdicted and
forbidden the use of them in themselves, yet by God, that made them and us,
many of these things being hurtful to many men, the use of them is forbid to
such. That which he adde's, neque ex part creaturarum, etc. neither out of the
creatures part is there any moral contradiction, is not true, there is a
moral contradiction; because many of these things are hurtful to many men,
therefore it is a moral contradiction to say, they should rightly be judged
useful; and my first disproportion mentioned, the quantity of the creatures,
enlarges the contradiction; when the vessel will hold but a Pint, it is a
contradiction to say, I will put in a Quar^ into it; when the narrow compass of
any particular man's thoughts can make use of but a few things, to say, that it
shall make use of all, is a contradiction, out of the vast quantity of the
creature, in respect of the narrowness of our abilities.

Sect. 7.
He urges another Argument thus: Unless this judgment by that reason
instituted be right, there can be given no rule, according to which a judgment
may be instituted of things which the Lord God has granted man to use, or what
these things are which he has withdrawn from his use. I answer, Other rule^ by
which to instit^te a right judgment beside reason.
many ways, according to the condition of the place wherein ^e live's; if in a
desert, unappropriated to any man, God has given him right to use any thing,
he meet's with, for his accommodation; if he live's in a Polity, God has given
him right to all such things as the Laws of the Nation entitle him to.

His third and last Argument for this cause is framed at the bottom of page 99.
How all creatures are granted to man's us^ limited.
Aut omnes creaturae; Either all crea^ures are granted to man's use, or none. I
will stop here, all creatures are granted to man's use, but not to this
particular man, but to man^ind, which that word man will involve; now he was to
prove, that they were useful to every particular, but he prove's his
conclusion, for, says he, if it be lawful for me to mine own use to destroy
any fit meat and natural form, why not all if it shall be expedient? Hi^
impossible sup^osition.
I answer him first, posito quolibet sequitur quidl^bet, that if it may be
expedient, is an impossible supposal; it cannot be expedient for any single man
to destroy this world. I answer secondly, His fal^acy a b^ne divisi^, etc.
that it is a fallacy a been divisi^ ad male conjuncta, the instances before of
meat and drink do evince this conclusion; take another; I am ^o ride a journey,
my friend offer's me five or six horses, give's me power to use any one, I can
use but one; they are all every one such as I have a right unto, but cannot use
more then one; I had right to each singular horse, but not to all. We may
conceive it just so with any particular man; Suppose we should grant that God,
in his journey to heaven, allow's man any creature in the world, yet, because
he cannot make use of all, he cannot say, that he has right to all conjunctim.
And then lastly, I say, as before, if a man live in a Polity, God has given
him use of such things only which the Law of the Polity entitle's him unto; if
in a desert, he has granted him whatsoever he can gain to his use. Thus, I
think, his first discourse is clearly enough answered, wherein I observe he is
a true follower of Mr. Hobbes, not in his conclusions only, but his way of
proving them by most fallacious Arguments.

So, says he, it is proved, that out of the creatures part there is no
obstacle in them, but that a man may use singulis and omnibus, every single and
all of them. This, he think's, he has proved, how weakly, I have showed.

Sect. 8.
He go's on next to show, that there is no repugnance out of the part of my
neighbor; I will wait upon that with which he begin's this page 100. This we
have proved (says he) that man has right to the use and possession of all
things which lack reason. I answer, man has, but no particular man: But (says
he) since my neighbor is constituted in the same dignity which God would have
me sustain (is his word) he ought to enjoy the same privilege which I do,
therefore to him should belong a like and equal right ^ver all creatures,
neither out of the respect of the creatures is one part allotted to him,
another to me.

The equality of right no argument that each man has a right to all.
This seems by him to be an introduction to what fallows, but indeed contain's
a main Argument against him; for two, much less two millions of men, particular
men, cannot have a right to the same thing. Therefore, says he, we must seek
somewhere else to find what portion is allotted to him, what to me, and then,
says he, let the adversaries turn which way they will, they must confess that
the distinction of these creatures arises only out of Covenant; this page
101. and this, says he, they do sufficiently declare, who teach, that in
extreme necessity the ancient right does revive, and the use of those things is
made lawful which they by Covenant had disposed away before. Thus far he.

The case, which he speak's of, may be thus put; A man ready to starve, The
case of necessity imply's no such universal right.
for want of food or clothes, take's a piece of bread, or meat, or a warm
garment, which belong's to another man, to supply his extremity; here, say his
Authors, in this extremity his right to these things revived: therefore, says
this Writer, he had right to all creatures before, or else his instance is
weak: I answer, the consequence is very infirm; he may have right to such
parcels of the world, yet not to all; he, who has right to little pieces in a
field, has not right to the whole; I have showed in my former piece, which I
now defend, that no right, but by some Law; the Law of humanity, give's him
right to this; by which we may, and ought to suppose, that men should do as
they would be done unto; and, when necessity compell's a man to such an
extremity, he need not stay to ask for it (which in that necessity he cannot
do) but take that leave which humane nature give's one to another, and by which
he is entiteled to those poor fragments; but what has this to do with the
universe, to the partition of which neither he nor any man living conferred to
divide?

Sest. 9.
Another instance he give's in a dissolved Commonwealth, where the Magistrate
can no longer use his authority, there it is lawful for men to invade their
neighbor's goods, so they have an honest intention to deliver them when he and
the Commonwealth are restored. I put down the sense of his words only for
brevitie's sake, and answer;

That it is not true, Nor dissolution of any Commonwealth.
that it is lawful to take any neighbor's goods, in such a case, unless he
have deserted them; if he have deserted the use of them, any man may use them,
not else; yet let a man consider these two instances, he shall find that they
are exceeding short to entitle any man to the interest of the whole world, or
all the creatures in it. And yet I may add further, that in both those
instances a man has but a temporal use of those things, not a full interest,
and estate in them until his extremity be relieved, or until the right owner
laid claim to them. A man has found a ring, he wear's it, the use of it is
his, but the ring is the right owner's still, and when he find's and claim's
it, the use likewise must be the old owner's, it was never the finder's more
then the use; so is it with these, the extremity supplied, the Commonwealth
restored, he has no longer use of them, he cannot justly sell or alien any of
those things from the true owner, which he may do with any thing is his own,
and therefore he had no right, interest, and title in them. He goe's on page
102.

Sect. 10.
But you may object, a certain portion is not allotted to every single man, An
Objection framed by the Author.
but any part of the world; neither is it lawful for one to subdue the whole,
for then it would be lawful for one man, if he had power to deprive others of
the necessaries for life, yea to kill another, which seems to oppose what he
had said before, when God decreeing to man the use of this life did decree
likewise to bestow upon him the use of these things useful to his life, which,
says he, one man cannot take from another, unless in extreme necessity, but he
does subvert the end which God intended in the creation of another. To this he
adde's another objection concerning the birth^right of the Eldest Son, who, he
says, A second of his not so strong.
has title to his Father's estate without compact; this second I esteem very
weak, and so meddle not with what he write's concerning it; but the first, I am
persuaded, is of invincible force, and his answer to it is miserable; his
answer is page 103. we answer, says he, not only in extreme necessities a man
may subdue the world, The first but weakly answered by him without regard to
God's end.
such a necessity being granted (such a necessity is impossible say I, because
the world cannot be necessary to relieve any man's extreme necessity, but only
very little parts of it) but also if any profit or commodity may be promised to
arise thence, as any Lord may use his good, neither can he offend against that
justice by which he is bound to render to his neighbor that which is his; the
rest in that Paragraph is but flourished to this purpose; now let a man
consider how this satisfies the preceding argument, that argument was drawn
from the end which God intended in the creating of both these, the preservation
of either was equally intended; does not then that man violate that justice
which ought to be used toward his neighbor, when, for his commodities, even
in superfluities, he shall deprive his Brother of necessaries? In his discourse
there is no semblance of satisfaction to this objection, when in his answer he
only affirm's, that a man has right to all things for his commodity, but never
set's down, God's end is preserved in that right; I mean to urge this Argument
stronger hereafter.

Sect. 11.
In the 104. page he undertake's boldly that he will prove, by most efficacious
Arguments, His first Argument for universal right returning, extreme necessity.
there is a right to the whole world belonging to every man* Page 105. he
begin's his proof; first, says he, because in extreme necessity a man's
ancient right does revive; he prove's that, because, says he, my calamity
cannot produce a right in me to such things, to which I had no right before; my
first answer to this is, that it is no more then what was said before; The
Bishop's several answers to it.
secondly, I answer, as before, that no man can have such an extremity as may
need the whole world; he cannot eat, drink, or clothe himself with the whole,
but parts, only; thirdly, I answer, his calamity revive's no title in the
miserable man, but only reduces him to be the object of mercy; and what
inconsiderable title he has, is a capability of a passive right to acts of
humanity, by which every man, who look's upon that wretched spectacle, is bound
to relieve him, and, when extremity give's not leave to any man to stay for the
convenience of asking, he take's that, out of a supposall that it will not be
denied.

His second Argument begin's in the last line of Page 105. and is thus framed;
the most Learned part of Divines and Lawyers consent, that in a moderation of a
Lawful defense, His second Argument for ancient right in a lawful defense.
the defendant is not made a public person, but does use his ancient right
which God has granted to every man. I will not trouble the Reader with every
word, the sense of the Argument consist's in this, that a man may defend
himself against violence; that in that defense he may Lawfully kill another;
And this arises not out of that, that he has done me wrong or injury, but out
of that regard, that God would have me defend my self; Now, says he, if it be
lawful to kill another, much rather to take his goods in defense of my self.

To understand the force or invalidity of this Argument, How the force o^
invalidity of this argument may be understood, and how the practice moderated.
let us look back to what has been said, how far my life is to be cared for,
and preserved by me, one rule of which is, when a more public concernment will
not be obtained by the loss, I am not to preserve my life by the ruin of
multitudes of my Nation, or Kingdom, of which I am a member; again, since he in
this Discourse supposes that men believe there is a God; and that this God is
a just judge punishing vice, and rewarding virtue, therefore I am to forsake
this life, and resign it rather then commit such sins which are of a greater
moment, and esteemed so by him, of which nature are Regicides, Paricides, nor
ought a man, in rescue of himself, to kill his King or his Father; I am
persuaded there is none that think's there is a God, which does not think that
such things are an abomination to him; then we will suppose two men, private
persons, the one assaulting the other; surely if a man can safely avoid the
danger, he ought to do it; but if he cannot, he may kill rather then be killed,
because there is no reason why a man should not think himself of as useful a
condition as another private man to the public state, or glory of God; but my
killing this man is not because I have a right over his person, but because I
have a right to defend mine own person from the injuries which are offered to
it by another private person, who has no more right to kill me, then I him,
which is none but in my own defense; for of two evils the Less is to be chosen;
either are evils in se, but this the Less to me; and this is no other then the
former; for it is not Lawful for me to kill another man, if I can avoid his
assault, but when there is an extreme necessity, and his assault is otherwise
unavoidable; so that it is still in an extreme necessity, and that may be
relieved with a few things, much less then the whole world.

Sect. 12.
Here he make's an objection thus; How does all this prove, that one single man
has right to the whole world, His Objection,
and that nothing out of the part of my neighbor does hinder it? (this is page
107.) he answer's, it does very much conduce for it. And answer.


For defense of my life, my liberty, my privileges, it is Lawful to kill
another, to break out into war against another; much rather will it be lawful
for any man to vindicate these goods to himself, which now submit themselves to
the first possessor; and to spoil my neighbor of all those things by which he
contend's to out me of my possession.

For answer; The Bishop's Animadversions showing the difference between just
(...) invasion, and sta^ing the r^ght of possession.
surely there is much difference in these cases; In the first I defend my life
and estate from an unjust invader; In the second I invade another's right and
interest, and when he says, that the other keep's him out of his possession
(quibus possessione mea me contend^t exuere, is his Phrase) I would fain know
what possession he can say he hat^ when the other, according to his own
language, is the occupant; but if he take possession here for the right of
possession, what right can he pretend to more then the occupant? or by what Law
does that title accrue to him? That which he adde's is of no Great force; or,
says he, when there shall be a just fear that he will do the like by me, if he
gain opportunities; this fear, Fear entitle's a man to nothing but a guard of
himself.
he speak's of, entitle's a man to nothing but a care of himself until
hostility or injury be offered, and then one may be provoked to a just war:
since, says he, these things, which I take from my neighbor, before Covenant,
Propriety without Covenant.
are no more his then mine;] I doubt not but I have, and shall show, that those
things, which are in the possession of another, are his own, if in his lawful
possession, without any other Covenant but the Law of nature; in the mean time
it must needs be granted, that the title is equal, and melior est conditio
possidentis; and since he offer's no force to the other, there can be no
justice for the other to offer violence to him; What he add's further, is a
Comparison between this case and war, that what is gotten in war is the
Conquerours, because then all Covenants cease, and the ancient rights return:
Certainly both the antecedent is weak and the consequent, The r^ght to good^
gotten by conquest what.
the antecedent, because the goods, gotten by conquest, are acquired by
conquest, not by an ancient right; many a man get's goods by conquest, in a
lawful war, who had no title before to them; I say else, all such gain is but
Robbery; nor does this simile agree; the Difference is great betwixt the taking
of a man's estate from him, who offered me no injury, and him who is my enemy,
and labor's my destruction; At the bottom of the 108. page he begin's with a
third Argument, which he thus f^ame^s; His third Argument.
because the right to the use and possession of things is to be taken from the
profit, which I conceive will redound to me by them, therefore what I shall
trust will be profitable for me I have a title to. The Bish^p's answer from the
fallibili^y of judgm^nt.
This Argument he is tedious in, I have reduced the whole force of it to this
narrow compass, and do return answer, that mine or any man's judgment of the
profitableness give's me no title to it, but the just and right judgment: I may
be deceived in my judgment, and judge that profitable which is unprofitable;
nay, although I judge truly, that it is profitable, yet so may any man's estate
be thought, that it would be profitable for me, if I could get it, nevertheless
I have no right to it.

Sect. 13.
At the bottom of the 110. page he enter's into another discourse against a
Conclusion which I have been engaged in, and must therefore undertake: his
Argument is thus, Prima occupatio, His argument against the right of Occupancy.
The first occupancy before Covenant shows no right of my neighbor in any
creature: his main reason is this, because then in no right, in any case of
necessity, they can return to me again, because that right is only in such
things which are yield^d or forsaken; which is a language I remember I have
used, and therefore do think this reflect's upon me.

First, to observe the weakness of this Argument, Which the Bishop shows to
hold well against Covenant.
consider that this Argument fight's equally against himself, as against me;
for he hold's, a right is obtained by covenant, and yet that right yield's to
extreme necessity, therefore a man may say that it fallows with no more force
against Occupancy, then against Covenant. What is the r^ght in necessity.
Secondly, I deny that the right return's in this condition, but a supposed
right of humanity invade's all mankind in such states, so that although a
particular man have occupancy, yet that Law, which dictate's, Do as you would
be done unto, appoint's the owner to relieve the necessitous person, yet I have
delivered, and that truly, that men in general have right to all things as
citizens of the world; but when any thing is appropriated by occupancy or civil
Laws, it belong's only to that person: Certainly, says he, ye shall find
nothing here but gentium institutio, the institution of nations, which give's
the occupant right, but not to him in whose view it come's first. My answer
will be short and clear, there is not the same reason for detection to give
right, Discovery (...) not an equal right with Occupancy.
as there is for the other of occupancy; first, an hundred may see the
Countre^, yea ten thousand, yet cannot all these have any title to it, which
must be in one. If a man had right to what he see's, any man's estate might be
his; but whosoever has a possession has an interest. Many men see the same
bird fly, the same fish in the Sea, yet it is only his who catches and get's
possession of it; not sight, but occupancy, yield's title and right. He give's
a third reason toward the 111. page, Finge, feign, says he, two men, the one
swift of foot, The imparity of swift and slow not considerable in the case.
the other slow, it appears how unequal this pair of men are in acquiring
dominion: I believe they are, and it is so in all conditions, one is strong,
another weak; one cunning, another foolish; and these may, by those abilities,
according to his method, get right from another; why then not the swift from
the slow, as well as in the other disparities? His Conclusion therefore from
these premises is exceeding weak, when he bring's it in with a Therefore;
Therefore, says he, to the first occupation out of nature no right is due; the
vanity of which conclusion is evident out of what has been said.

What he add's next, concerning misery and charity, is not worth the
considering; nor his fighting with imaginary Arguments which succeed. I shall
endeavor now to assist the Reader with some spectacles, whereby he may more
easily see through those mists which he has cast before these truths; and
first, he may consider, that these two Propositions, The Author's two
Propositions destructive to humane Society;
That a man now existing in the world (for of such he must dispute) has a
right to all things in the world; and the second, That first occupancy give's
no right, are of such an horrid nature, so destructive to humane society and
friendship, that although fallacious arguing might deceive a man's Reason, yet
men ought to abhor them: For if it be true, that each particular man has
right to all things, whatsoever a man get's by secure fraud, or force, is but a
lawful recovery of his own; For if he ought to bestow his whole endeavors for
the advancement of his own contentment, and he has right to every thing, his
secure obtaining is just and right, be it which way it will; Nor can he answer
this out of his own principles, and much less out of Mr. Hobbes, who conceiving
(as he does) that this is the right of nature, so Mr. Hobbes expressly, no man
can die himself of it, (and sure no man can put off that which naturally
belong's to him) then it must follow, that such things may be acted carefully.
and Trade.
Then let us consider, the second Proposition, were it received amongst men,
how might it spoil all commerce betwixt Merchants, betwixt men of diverse
nations; for if occupancy give no title, it may be lawful for men to defraud,
to get by force what they could from an Indian, because I know of no title they
have but of occupancy.

No man can discern what title any Subjects have in those goods they enjoy, The
difficulty of discerning different titles to goods and estates.
who is not thoroughly acquainted with the Laws of those several nations, nor
then, unless he can survey their deeds and evidences, by which those goods were
conveyed to them: Surely they are not to be wrested out of any man's hands, but
by such courses as may first evince his title, and therefore possession, quiet
possession, with prescription, is an undoubted just title any where. Little
peace to be expected if that of Occupancy be not allowed.
And if we will have peace, which is the labor of all Politics, we must allow
Occupancy to be a sacred title. And this is evident out of that which was
delivered in the 13. and 14 chapter of Leviathan; For it is not possible to think
that Ham in the 9. of Genesis did consent to his subjection to Shem or Japhet
either, but each would, and might, take their possession in what quarter of the
world they would, and the Providence of God would so dispose affairs, that it
should come to pass according to that Prophecy. All the sons of Noah were
thrust into the Common of the world, when any one seized upon any thing
unpossessed, it was his, and must be so, or else men and all things in the
world would be in a confusion.
