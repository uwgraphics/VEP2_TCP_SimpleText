A LETTER FROM THE POPE TO THE French KING.
To our dear Son in Christ Jesus, LEWIS, the Most Christian King. Most dear Son
in Christ, health and our Apostolic Benediction,
THE high Exploits of your Royal Valor have drawn upon them the Eyes of all
Christendom, being a great deal of comfort to our Fatherly care, as well in
regard of the glory of the Army, as the hope of your Triumph. For considering,
as we do, with much grief the impiety of the Heretics, living in some places
without fear or danger, and exercising on others the Laws of cruel Government,
We now thank the Lord of Hosts, that has in so fit an opportunity made your
Majesty take up Arms to maintain the Divinity of the Catholic Religion (a fair
Apprentiship of a Royal Warfare) and worthy of a most Christian King. What an
admirable thing it is, that the age which others out of softness and idleness
use to pass away in Sports and Delights, your Majesty should employ so
generally, so fortunately, in appeasing Differences, in conducting Armies, and
besieging places of Heretics, and all not without the special Counsel of God
by whom Kings Reign. It is almost incredible that the very first steps of your
Youth should carry you to so troublesome and high an Enterprise, and the
Dangers and difficulties which stop others in their Courses, should only serve
as a Spur to the greatness of your Courage. Dear Son, keep the Renown your Name
has got, follow the God that fights for you to the end: As you are now held
the Thunderbolt of War, and Buckler of Peace, so you may hereafter be held the
praise of Israel, and the Glory of the World. From the Seat of our Apostolic
Dignity, whither it has pleased God to raise us, unworthy of so great a Grace,
we assist your Armies with our hearts and affections, and to our Prayers
prepare the Divine Remedies, and though we doubt not but your own Virtue will
make you constant in the Work you have begun.

Nevertheless we have thought good to add our Exhortations, that the World may
see the cure we have of the advancement of the true Religion, and how willing
we are to give way to your Glory, you being hitherto infinitely bound to God
for his bounty toward you, having your mind endued with Celestial Doctrine,
and not with the bare Precepts of Humane Reasons, do well know that Kingdoms
have their Foundations upon the truth of the Orthodox Faith, and indeed unless
God keep the City what Principality can subsist with any assurance?

It may be easily judged with what fidelity they are likely to defend the Royal
Throne, that have cast the very Saints themselves out of the Temple, and, done
as much as in them lay to put them out of the number of the blessed, yea out of
Paradise it self, that with impious temerity condemn Institutions of our
Forefathers, the Customs of Kings, the Decrees of Popes, and the Ceremonies of
the Church; these are disturbers of our Church and the Commonweal, and the
Reproaches of France, whom the great God has determined to be extermined in
your Reign: Know then that all Europe (which the event of the Reign holds now
in suspense) hope shortly to hoist sail upon the Ocean under your conduct, to
the end that place which now serves for sanctuary and protection to the
Heretics and Rebels may one day serve for a mark of your Victory.

We are confidently persuaded, that neither fear nor inconstancy shall ever be
able to divert you from the pursuit of your Enterprise, only we would have you
remember, that the Saints in Heaven assists him that takes upon him the defense
of Religion, and fights on his side like Fellow Soldiers. The same God that
heretofore hardened the Waters like dry Land, and turned the Waters of the Sea
into a Wall to give safe passage to his Childrens Army, will certainly be as
favorable to you; and then we shall have good cause to hope, that after you
have established your own Kingdom, and crushed the impiety that is there, you
may one day win the Orient and the Occident, imitating the Glory of Your
Ancestors, who have born ever as much respect to the Exhortations of Popes, as
to the Commandments of Saint Lewis, whose Name You bear, and whose steps You
follow, invites You to it; so did the first of Your Race, who in defending the
Apostolic Authority, and propagating Christian Religion, laid the surest and
best Foundation of Your Royal House. Follow dear Son (which are the Ornaments
of the World) the Commandments of Heaven, pour forth your Wrath and indignation
upon those people that have not known God, to the end the divine Treasure of
Heaven may belong to you by just acquisition; in the mean time we send you our
Apostolic Benediction.

Given at Rome in Great Saint Marys, under the Seal of the Fisher.
FINIS.
