holding in one Arm a Pillar of Marble, and in the other Hand a Shield Vert,

sits, first, LAW, a proper Lady, aptly attired, having on her a long, Sable,
plain Robe, with a Mantle of Scarlet, and on her Head (adorned with long,

next to her sits PIETY, in a White Robe, with a Black Mantle, a Book in one
Hand, and an Hourglass in the other; and on her Head a bright, long Silver
Vail reaching all over her Shoulders: and next to her sittteth a Sober person
representing GOVERNMENT, in a Scarlet Robe faced with Furrs; about her Neck a
Chain of Gold, and on her Head a Cap of Maintenance; in one Hand the Kings
Banner, in the other the Cities. His Lordship being fixed in the posture of
attention, Pallas rises up, descends to the Stage, and makes Address in
these Expressions.

The First SPEECH, spoken by Pallas.

I Am the Deity of Arts and Arms,
That do by Sciences and loud Alarms
Give Orders to the Universe, from me
Does issue both Art and Artillery;
My Name is Pallas, by me Men are endu'd
With Justice, Law, Prudence and Fortitude.
