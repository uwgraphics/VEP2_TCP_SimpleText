JAMES R.

WE have upon mature Consideration, thought fit to Call a Parliament, speedily
to be Assembled, in which We make no doubt, but Care will be taken for Settling
a sufficient Revenue on the Crown for the Support of the Government; The
Necessities of which, in maintenance of the Navy for Defense of Our Kingdom,
and the Advantages of Trade Requiring, That the Customs and Subsidies of
Tonnage and Poundage, and other Sums of Money, payable upon Merchandises
Exported and Imported, Be continued to be Collected, as in the time of Our
Dearest Brother lately Deceased. We do therefore by and with the Advice of Our
Privy Council Require, And Our Will and Pleasure is, That the said Duties be
Collected accordingly, by all and singular the Officers and Collectors Within
all and every Our Ports in any of Our Dominions, not doubting of a ready
Compliance herein from all Our Loving Subjects.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall, the Ninth Day of February, In the First Year
of Our Reign. God save the King.
