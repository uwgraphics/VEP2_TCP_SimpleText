A Paper concerning such as are made Ministers by the will of man, and an
exhortation to all sober minded people to come out from among them.
What ministry is that which is upheld by a Law given forth in man's will
contrary to the Law of God, if it be not Antichristian? and whether or no their
Ministry was from God that haled out of the Synogoues, or those that were
haled? And whether Paul's Ministry was not according to what you now
persecute, who went into the Synagogues to reason with them, after the same
manner as we do now, who received not his Ministry from man, neither had
it by man, though he was brought up at the feet of Gamaliell, he counted that
which he learned there, as dung and dross, in comparison of the excellency of
Jesus Christ; and now with the Same light, your form of prayer, and form off
preaching without the power, it is as dross and dung to me, and to all that
live in the life, who know Christ to be the high Priest over the household of
God, whose Government is on his shoulders, who will not acquit the wicked,
neither shall the evil doer escape his hand; for the hand of the Lord is
streched out, and by the bareing of his arm are we Saved from all our
trangressions, which by no other means could be done; for when I wallowing in
my blood, and no eye pitied me, nor none could cure my disease, when I went
through the vale of misery, in the cloudy and dark day, when no light appeared,
then was I following men, but darkness was over the whole earth in me, which
was my great sorrow but sometimes hope was an anchor, that it should not be
always so, but when the flood came I was as one overwhelmed with sorrow, for
all my actings, and my prayers returned in vain; while I was acting for life,
the living suffered in me, which groaned for deliverance, and the groans of
that was heard, and not my prayers, then the Son of Righteousness appeared to
me, with healing under his wings, then he rent the vail, and uncovered all that
I had done, and showed me the book wherein all my actions were set down, that I
had acted against him ever since I was a child, and indeed I could read in it,
and knew what was written there, then was the acceptable year of the Lord God,
and the day of vengeance to the ungodly in me, then was the vials of the wrath
of God powered forth upon me without mixture, and indeed it was given me to
drink deeply but I desired that I might be spared, but it was to let me see
that I had Sinned against God, and I should bear his indignation, until he did
plead my cause, for I was condemned, but the Blood of the Son of God ransomed
me and brought me into freedom, which by no other means could be done; then he
showed me his doctrine, and writ his Law in me, and placed his word in my
heart, which is an everlasting witness for himself, and against all the world,
that their deeds are evil, who by his power has shaken, and caused all my
bones to tremble, and to stagger like a drunken man, but the remainder of
himself could not be Shaken, for he was stricken, and by his stripes were we
healed, and by his light we see all hirelings, and persecutors to be out of his
doctrine; therefore we deny them; So all people who fear God come out from
among them (least you be partakers of their plagues) as I have done.

The difference between the worlds relation which stands in strife, malice and
wickedness, and the Saints relation which stands in love, life, peace and joy
in the Holy ghost has a knowledge and with it corrupt themselves, and has a
humility, but feigned, and has a worship but in the will, and has a
righteousness but in the self; and speaks the high words but it is in
hypocrisy, and has a liberty but in the flesh, whore the spirit is in prison,
who in Caines way is gone, and has not a habitation in God, whose affections
are below in the earth, and serve the lusts and the pleasures, whose
conversation is among the wicked, and there is the worlds relation where
lodges the strife and the debate and deceit, and disdain, and setting up that
which God will throw down, now while this is standing which is contrary to the
light, they that in the light do walk, and be in it, these they deny, and
Sees that which leads nature our of its course, and what sets the whole
course of nature on fire, and there the whole world are in confusion, and all
the tongues are unbridled, where power over them is not, while that reigns
which leads nature out of course, his religion is vain, and that relation
stands out of truth, but all such as to the light are turned, See with the
light (and that does manifest what leads nature out of course,) the marriage
that is honorable, and what sets the whole course of nature on fire, and
what leads nature into course, where the pure relation and the entrance of it
is received, where the self and its righteousness is denied, and the
righteousness of Christ received, where the worship of the will is denied,
and the worship of God in Spirit and Truth received, where self righteousness
is denied, and Christ the righteousness of God received, and the former
conversation put of and the conversation in Heaven witnessed, the affections
below changed, and the affections which are above come to; here is the pure
Religion known without guile, which are out of Cains way, where the
habitation in God is witnessed and seen, where the just lives by his faith,
and honoring in the Lord known, and the true humility Learned of Christ, who
is not of the world, though it by him was made, who lights every man that
comes into the world, who is man's way out of it; which light is man's
condemnation if he do not believe in it; and the relation which is in the
world (who hate the light,) is in the lust, where the perversenes is in the
love of the world, where the envy is, where the invention is, selfeishness,
crossenesse, perverseness, backbiting, maliciousnes, filling with
unrighteousness, yet they have a love, yet they have a relation, now the light
which comes from the beloved Son of God, where the Love of God is received, the
worlds relation is denied, for the relation of the world destroys and
devoures, but the children of the light, which be in the relation out of the
World, live in peace, unity, and fellowship, and comfort enjoyed in the holy
Ghost, so all you that profess relation in words, and envy lodges in your
hearts against one another, and yet flatter one another to your faces, and
backbite one another, behind the back, such relations we deny, and have a
witness in your consciences against it; And all that profess a relation one to
another, and love and friendship with the tongue, and in heart deceive one
another, and cozen, and cheat one another, and lie, and dissemble one with
another, all such relations we deny, and have a witness in your conscience
against it: And such as profess religion, or worship, or humility,
righteousness, and the Scripture, Christ and the Prophets words, and live out
of their life, and live in envy and malice, and yet profess you have a
relation to Christ, and God, whom ye have not seen, and you love him, and do
not love them whom you have seen, such relations we do deny; and all such as
cry up your experiences, high notions, manifestations, as you call them,
dispensations as you call them, and live in pride, strife, and envy, debates,
derision, scorns, loftiness, highmindedness, you be out of the light and out
of the way, in (...), and out of the pure relation, we have a witness in your
conscience against those things, which lets you see what you possess, and will
let you profess no more if to it you hearken, which turns from the world and
the relations therein, for all who believe not the light, and are not to it
come, have a love, but it is in the world; and a relation, but it is in the
world, which is enmity to God, so that relation which is enmity is denied with
the light, that love which is enmity, is denied with the light, which leads to
the pure relation, which envies not, where the destroyer, and devourer is
rebuked.

THe faith of such no better then the faith of the Pharisees who only believe
of a Christ, because the Scriptures declare of him, but the faith of them who
dwell in the life and power of God and follow the Lamb whethersoever he goes, is
that faith which overcomes the world. To believe of a Christ because the
Scriptures declare of him, is to believe as the Pharisees did believe, who were
the persecutors and murderers of the just, but to believe in the light, the
life that gave forth the Scriptures is seen, and Christ is believed in, and
here he has the witness in himself, and comes to be a child of light and born
of God, which birth overcomes the world, and now says Christ they hate the
light because their deeds are evil, and will not bring their deeds to it,
because the light will reprove them, and this is the condemnation the light
says Christ; and now it does appear them that hate the light, priests,
teachers, people, young and old hate the light, and will not bring their deeds
to the light, because the light will reprove them, neither will they suffer
others that walk in the light, and love the light, and bring their deeds to
the Light and show their deeds with the light, and reprove them with the light,
because they hate the light, and them that walk in it, and cast them into
Prison, and so are stumbling at the light. All sorts of people, (mark) it is
the light that they hate, says Christ, they hate the light which reproves
their evil deeds, and this light is that which the world and the teachers
thereof cannot endure to be talked off, but hate it and them that walk in it,
and it is the light that is so much stumbled at, so because their deeds are
evil, and they walk in darkness, there is a proof, for they that walk in the
light stumble not, but come to receive the light of life, here Christ's words ^s
fulfilled amongst them that hate the light, and will not bring their deeds to
the light, because the light will reprove them, for that which does make
manifest is light, so that which makes manifest they cannot endure, but would
be in the dark, and keep their deeds in the dark as it is manifest, and says
Christ the Devil shall cast some of you into prison, he is out of the light out
of the truth, and a liar, and a murderer from the beginning, which now is seen
with the light, and trampled upon, and all that own not the light which comes
from the word, are the wicked seeds men, sowing abroad their tares, their lies,
the evil reports, and them that are gone from the light, that comes from the
word of truth, are given up to believe lies and reports, and may cry up
darkness, if you hate the light what have you to cry up else, if you turn from
the light, pittyful preaching, which hates the light, which manifests all the
works of darkness.
