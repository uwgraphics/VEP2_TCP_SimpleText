Here is a true and perfect Relation from the Faulcon at the Banke-side; of the
strange and wonderful aperition of one Mr. Powel a Baker lately deceased, and
of his appearing in several shapes, both at Noonday and at night, with the
several speeches which past between the spirit of Mr. Powel and his Maid Jone
and diverse Learned men, who went to alay him and the manner of his appearing to
them in the Garden upon their making a circle, and burning of wax Candels and
Jenniper wood, lastly how it vanished.
The tune of Chevy Chase.


STrange news, strange news, I here have write
come lissen and I Will tell,
The strangest news that ever yet
within our age befell.
And I Will repeat it word by word
to let the Nation know,
The mighty wonders of the Lord,
which he to them does show.
For near upon five months ago,
there was a Baker ^yed,
Clo^e by the Faulcon many know,
which is on Southwarke side.
His body after bury^d was,
in earth for to remain,
But not leng sense it came to pass,
that his Spirit ros^ again.
And walked up and down the place,
where he before did dwell,
And looked most Ghasful in his face,
that hundreds there can tell.
And rattling throw the house would he,
afrighting people that.
He sometimes like a Goat would be,
and sometimes like a Catt.
He into several shaps would turn,
with dolful voices then
He Would like a flame of fire burn,
straight to a man again.
This house he constant haunted that,
at midnight and noonday
And sometimes seemed like a Catt,
which scared his Son away.
Then none within this house did dwell,
but one poor servant Maid
Which very often did perceive
this ghasful Ghost she said.
Whose pale and dreadful glemering sight,
reduced her to a fear
For making of the bed one night,
it to her did appear.
She then beholding of his face,
poor Soul it made her quake
And she lay trembling in the place,
that every joint did shake.
He up and down the Chamber ran,
his hands abroad were spre^d
His Nose was waxed pale and wan,
his eyes sunk in his h^ad.
At which the Maid cried out O Lord,
I heartily do pray
That by the power of thy word,
chase this same fieend away.

Repeating these same words again,
with lifting hands upright
At which the Aperition then,
quite vanished out of sight.
But on the morrow morning next
the same appeared again*
He on the house so much reflect,
few durst within remain.
The Maid a fire making was,
about the house did stur
Which time she heard a doleful voice,
one knocking at the door.
The M^id replied then who is there,
and to the door did run
Quoth he thy good old Master's heart;
come tell me where is my Son.
At which the Maid run backward in,
and not one word did say
And for that time the spirit then,
did vanish quite away.
But afterward it came to pass,
late in the Evening tide
He underneath a Peartree was,
where he again was spyed.
For he within the Garden walked
where Jone came by chance,
And this same spirit with her talked,
that she fell in a trance.
Beside her senses they were lost,
at such a sight to see
For pure Nature with a Ghost,
can never well agree.
Then Learned men of Art came there,
this Spirit to alay
Which did immediatele appear,
and they to it did say.
Gods holy Saints did much convert,
there actions now are blessed
We Conjure thee for to depart,
unto thy place of rest.
The aperition in a pause,
did vanish none knew whether
Saying woe to them which are the cause,
of this my coming hither.
By skill these Learned men does sea
and by their art discry
Some hiden treasure there must be,
and in the Garden lie.
And yet these Conjurers does say,
their task has proved so
The spirit they cannot alay,
whatever they can do.
O what strange wonders now are these;
the Lord amongst us se^d
God grant hereafter they might cease,
and we our lives amend.
