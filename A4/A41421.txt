A Good Wife, or None.
To a pleasant new Tune.



The glazing Torch is soon burnt ont,
the Dimonds light abides,
The one in glory shines about,
the other it is virtue hides:
That spark (if any) shall be mine,
that else give light to none:
For if to every one she shine:
I had rather lie alone.
The glowworm in the dark gives light
unto the view of many,
The Moon she shows her self by night,
and yields her self to any:
But if my love should seem to me,
of every one so known:
She never more should shine on me,
I had rather lie alone.
I Will not consume and pine away,
as other lovers do,
For such as wandering walk astray
and never will prove true:
I Will set as light by any she,
as she by me has done:
And fix my love and constancy,
Or else I Will lie alone.
A Willow garland for my head,
I never mean to wear,
I need no Pillow for my bed,
I yet am void of care:
A single life is without strife,
and free from sigh and groan,
For such contentmens of my life,
I Will choose to lie alone.
Once did I love the fairest love,
that ever I did see,
But she did most unconstant prove,
and set no love by me;
And ever since my mind is such,
to lend my love ^o to none,
Because I have been crossed so much,
I Will ever lie alone.
The beauty of the fairest Flower,
so pleasing to the eye,
Does fade and wither in an hour,
and no man sets thereby:
So deals my fair with me,
her joys in love are gone,
Wherefore the wanton world shall see,
I Will choose to lie alone.


WEll may we picture, Cupid blind,
which roving shot his dart,
And made my lover most unkind,
to steal away my heart:
Which cannot be restored again,
it is so lovesick grown,
For she has ki^'d it with disdain,
therefore I Will lie alone.
Within that face I once did see,
two Dimend eyes whose bright,
And glistering beams so dazzled me,
that I was ravished quite:
And struck so blind I could not see,
the way that I had gone,
But from fond love I Am now set free,
and choose to lie alone.
This single life brings golden ease,
no jealous thoughts offend,
the wedded wights go where they please
and fear no changing friend:
while married mates with musing mind
do sob, and sigh and groan:
Because their Turtles prove unkind,
therefore I Will lie alone.
What if the willow Garland be,
appointed for my lot,
Yet this content shall comfort me,
false love is soon forgot:
A second love must make amends,
now that the first is gone,
For Cressus kind had many friends,
else still had lyn alone.
For could I but call my choice,
out of Diana's train,
who would not hear the tempters voice,
then I might love again:
And cause some of more constant light
then that which lately shone,
My equal f^n^y to requite,
or else I Will lie alone.
For time and opportunity
will w^e the coyest Dame,
And overcome the chastest she,
that bares the bravest (...):
Yea, man was made for woman's good,
not idle like the drone,
But for to heat and stir the blood,
and not to lie alone.
