royal blazon or coat of arms
BY THE Lord Deputy General OF IRELAND.
OSSORY,

WHEREAS we are informed that to the disadvantage of His Majesty's Service,
diverse Officers of His Majesty's Army in this Kingdom do absent themselves from
their several Quarters without our License, and whereas upon the account of the
last Harvest, which did require the personal oversight of several of the said
Officers having Estates and Tillage remote from their Quarters, as also
considering that diverse of them may have necessary occasions to attend in
Dublin this Term, we have been pleased to dispense with their attendance upon
their duty in those times, whilst other competent Officers were with their
Troops and Companies; Now we think fit and do hereby require and command, that
all and every the said Officers which at the present are absent from their
Quarters shall return thereunto respectively, before the Four and Twentieth day
of February next, notwithstanding any Licenses of absence formerly granted, and
not depart from their several Quarters without License to be obtained from us,
to such purpose; And we do declare that if any of the said Officers shall in
any sort contemn or transgress what we have hereby commanded, such Officer or
Officers shall be dismissed from Employments in His Majesty's Army, whereof we
require all persons whom it may any way concern to take due notice.

Given at His Majesty's Castle of Dublin the 29th day of January, 1668.
