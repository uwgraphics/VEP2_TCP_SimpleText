THIS Court taking into their Consideration, that the utmost time appointed for
taking down and removing all such Sheds, Shops, and other like Buildings, which
have been erected since the late dismal Fire, in Smith-Field, Moor-Fields, and
other void Places within this City, does now very near approach, Lady Day next
having been prefixed by this Court for that purpose, in pursuance of the
Additional Act of Parliament for Rebuilding the City of LONDON: This Court does
now think fit to publish and declare, That they expect and require that all
persons concerned should yield a ready Compliance and Obedience to their former
Orders in that behalf, and remove all such their Sheds and Buildings, with
their Goods and Materials therein, precisely by the said time; otherwise this
Court will be enforced to pull down the said Sheds, and make Seizure of all
such Goods and Commodities which shall be found upon the said Ground after the
said 25th day of March.

Wagstaffe.
