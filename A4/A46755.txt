THE CONTENTS
Section 1. A General Hint of such points as have been handled out of this
Text.

Doing here how to be understood? Namely, Evangelically and so as to be
extended ^o conversion, Faith, and to Gods will, manifested by word and work.

This will of God made known in his word, the only Rule of our Doing, and of
all our Actions.

And not 1. Gods secret will. 2. The Will, Command, and Example of others. 3.
Ou^ own will and wisdom.

Sect. 2. Two maine doubt^ propounded and answered i^ this Treatise. 1. Doubt
(...) whether Gods promises of Salvation, etc. be doubtful, because they are
Conditional Here concerning the Validity of Gods Conditional promise^ and
force of the motives thence to weldoing.

Happiness and salvation promised Conditionally:

1 To weldoing. 2 To Constancy he rein.

Yet is not the happiness of the Elect uncertain: Either in it self, or to
them always after Conversion.

How Gods Word speake^ differently of the same things. Two Considerations for
the clearing of the first doubt.

Sect. 3. First Consideration: Gods promises distinguished: Some are of the
end; and these are Conditional; Some are of the Means, and they are absolute.

Sect. 4. A Digression, further clearing, and justifying the aforesaid
distinction from the imputation of Libertinisme.

1 In as much as life is not promised, but upon Condition, ^eglect of the means
is excluded.

2 Concerning the absolute promises of the Means and Conditions.

1 The Means being many must not be divided.

2 Yet they may and must be compared: and so some gra^es are considered as Ends
and Effects of former and more common graces, such as the Gospel, etc. is.

3 Yet the promises of the End, whether maine End, or mean End, as the End,
are ever Conditional; and the promises of the Means, as Means, ever
absolute, whether they be Means more remote, or nearer.

4 The Gospel it self is absolutely promised, and also freely given, both for
the outward Ministry, (which is directed by speciall^hoyce, and sent to some,
not to all,) and for the inward work and power of it.

Sect. 5. These promise^ concerning the Means and Conditions of Life, depend
on Gods election.

Gods election is not conditional, though his word be

Sect. 6. Yet 1. God mocke^ none in his word.

2. His Word and Decre^ are not contrary one to another

Sect. 7.3. Gods Decree takes ^ot away the Consent and Li^erty of man's will.

Sect. 8. Second Conside^^tion. The Conditions requi^^d of us, are also part of
Gods ^ovenant and promise made unto us.

One maine difference between the Law and Gospel.

Sect. 9. What God re^uires, he both promises and ^orketh in the Elect. This
is ^ewed in diverse graces, as

1 In Faith, which God, (...) Requires, 2 Promises, (...) Works.

Sect. 10.2. In remissi^n of sin, which God, Requires. 2. Promises, etc.

Sect. 11.3. In Repen^nce, which God, 1. requi^^th, 2. promises, etc.

Sect. 12.4 In New obedience, which God. 1. requires, etc.

Sect. 13.5. In perseverance which God, 1. requires. 2. Pro. etc.

Sect. 14. So in other graces, as Fear of God, knowledge and in humility an^
meekness, which God, 1. requires, 2. promises, 3. wo^keth; Yea all graces
given (...) in time, are according to God Election of us before time.

Sect. 15. Second doubt^ Whether it be in our power t^ keep the Conditions,
and (...) do things required.

2 If not, to what end a^ such precepts and exhortation.

First Branch. It is showed that it is not in man's power (...) do well; to
convert, etc. as (...) himself.

Sect. 16. What pow^^ man has in Civil actions.

Of seven degrees, to be c^^sidered in the perfecting of (...) very good work,
and that n^ any one of them is in man's power.

Sect. 17. Reasons hereof. 1. His ignorance. 2. Unbelief. 3. Natural
impotencie.

The estate of each man before his Conversion: Showing how unable he is to do
good.

Sect. 18. Use. To teach us humility, and to ascribe all to Gods power, which
subdues our rebellion. Though we will, yet both power and act are from God.

Sect. 19. Gods grace is more then a gentle swasion, or common influence.

The power of Gods grace in giving Faith, and working Conversion, showed out of
Scripture.

Sect. 20. Four absurdities: Ensuing out of the Doctrine of common grace.

1 Our benefit by Christ should be no more certain then that which we had and
lost in Adam.

2. God should be no more effectual in good then Satan in Evil.

3. Man's goodness should be ascribed to himself more then to God.

4. The difference between the good and bad should be made by man himself,
and by nature, and man converted should have cause to glory even in Gods sight.

Sect. 21. Whence man's conversion is? it is from Gods special grace, who
removes the aforesaid impediments, 1 Of ignorance, 2. unbelief, 3. Inability.

Sect. 22. What may be ascribed to man; What must be ascribed to God.

What our Churches Doctrine is herein.

Sect. 23. Use hereof: 1. To give all glory to God, and not any to our selves.
Thus to do is truly Christian.

To glory in our selves, 1. Heathenish, 2. Popish. 3. Jewish, 4. Profane. Such
can neither pray aright, nor be truly thankful.

Sect. 24. Use 2. To Comfort us, from the immutability of Gods purpose and
promises; On which, and not on our selves, his grace and our Salvation depends.

To ascribe all to God the safest.

Sect. 25. Second Branch, of the second maine doubt.

To what end then are Gods precepts and exhortations? The needfulnes of this
question.

The answer in three things.

1. Our strength is now not to be measured by Gods Commandments.

Sect. 26.2. Gods precepts and Exhortations are grounded on his promise.

Sect. 27.3. These Exhortations yet are not in vain.

1. Not in regard of the reprobate, who thus

1. Told what they could have done.

Are, 2. Convinced: and so the Commandment in regard of God, not in vain; Tet
is not God unjust in so doing, Why?

3. Restrained: So that the Godly live more peaceably by them.

Sect. 28.2. Such praecepts are not in vain, in regard of the Elect.

1 Unconverted, who thus

1. Are taught to deny themselves, to fly to Christ, and to seek help where
only it may be had.

Sect. 29.2. Are indeed converted, such precepts and Exhortations are
sanctified of God as means of Conversion.

Gods Word is operative.

Sect. 30.2. Converted, who thus are put in mind:

1. To stir up Gods grace in them:

2. To seek after perfection, and to be thank full.

Sect 31. These Exhortations expel Security, notwithstanding that Gods grace
work all.

1. Ministers must exhort, and the people must depend on the public Ministry.

Sect. 32. The certainty of Election, and of Gods grace, should whet our
diligence to all good duties.

1. Such as know their election, must not neglect means.

2. Much less should such as know it not as yet.

^. All must strive to do well and expect an End, answerable to their Doings.

Sect. 33. A general inference, teaching how, from the foregoing Discourse to
conceive of other controverte^ points, as praedestination etc.

Sect. 34. All other point are framed according to the Doctrine of Gods
praedestivation, though the Remonstrants (pretending so much) make Free Will
and the power of nature the chief matter of their contention, and accordingly
frame other points.

Sect. 35. The Doctrine taught concerning Gods Free and effectual grace, lets
us see:

1. That his Election is absolute and independent.

2. That Grace and Redemption are not universal.

3. That the Salvation and preseverance of the Saints is certain.

4. That the Faithful may be assured of their Election and Salvation.

JOHN 13.17. Happy are ye if ye do them.


SECTION I.
HAving out of this Verse in several Sermons, A general Hint of such points
as have been handled out of this Text.
already (after a general and Methodicall deciphering of Happiness, according
as the Scriptures speak diversely of it) considered 1. Of the things to be
known, and that both according to their restraint, only things revealed, and
specification here, namely duties of love and humility; 2. Of our duty and the
necessity of knowing them; 3. Of our duty in believing, willing, and affecting
the things known; 4. The necessity of practice to be added to knowledge.

Whence we concluded, that true knowledge is not bare knowledge, but such as is
accompanied with good and answerable affections and actions.

We are now in the 5th and last place to consider of that blessedness, or at
least assurance of Blessedness, which results out of such practice, as a
strong motive to excite and stir up to the practice of things known, and that
out of these last words: Happy are ye if ye do them. And so from thence to
try our knowledge, by our practice and obedience.

Where it would be considered that we must conceive of doing here, Doing here
understood Evangelically, and so as to be extended to Conversion, Faith, and
Repentance, etc.
not legally, according to the rigor of the Law; For so should never any man
be happy, (And Christ only performed that perfect obedience to Gods will, and
we only in him:) but Evangelically, according to the equity of the Gospel,
and according to a weaker degree of obedience, performed in sincerity, Faith,
and constancy, and such as God will graciously accept of in Christ; So that we
may and must also extend this Doing more largely as having reference to Gods
whole will, revealed and made known unto us.

Now God manifests his will either by his words o^ works; By word: 1. O^
Command, both Legal and Evangelicall; And so no^ only obedience, Gods will
how manifested.
but Faith. Repentance, Conversion etc. come within the Compass of Gods
command* This is his commandment* that we should believe on the Name of his
Son Je^us Christ, and love one another, etc. And this is the work o^ God, that
ye believe on him whom he has sent. 1 Ioh. 3.23. Ioh. 6.29. Isa. 1.16.17


2. Of Restraint, and threatening; and so our Doing is indeed our not doing* of
evil forbidden, according to that, Cease to do^ evil, learn to do well.

3. Of Promise; whether ^osolute or Conditional; ^o that our obedience and
^oing according to this lord will be also our Faith, and our keeping, and
ob^erving the Conditions, of ^epentance, Obedience, ^c. Upon which the pro^ises
are made.

2. By Work, and by the ^vent experimentally ac^ording to his word; which ^it
be good, then the thing ^^quired is our thankfulesse: if evil, befalling our
^lves, our Doing is our pa^ent suffering, as we are ^ught to pray: Thy will be
^ne (which includes also a ^illing suffering) and to say, ^e will of the Lord
be ^one; if it befall others, A^^. (...)
our ^oing is Fearing, (...) And our amendme^t, Lu. 13.5.

Now before I urge the further necessity of this doing from the motive of
happiness in the Text, The ^ule of our doing, is only Gods will made known.
consider we briefly from the words, the rule of our acti^ ons and obedience,
which we may consider of from the last word in the Tex^ (...), Them. For we
the are directed to Gods one^ Will and to things reve^^led and made known u^
to us; which as we ha^ heard are, according (...) their restraint only thin^
revealed, and which w^ are bound (and here su^posed) to know; our D^ings must
be squared, a^cording to the things w^ know; and this (...) he^ must answer
that (...), (...) that our Doings should (...) her be scanter, nor larger, ^hen
these things which ^re made known and re^ealed.

For 1. We must do all ^^e know to be done, otherwise we should live in sins
against knowledge and ^onscience, and so should ^nne more damnably and
^excusably, and be beaten ^ith more strips.

2. And in Doing we must ^ot (especially in matters ^f Gods worship) do any
^ing but according to that ^^e and will of God made ^nowne, and that both for
^atter and manner: I^. 2.12.
We ^ust set that only rule be ^re us, and make it the ^quare and Line, the
Samp^r and the Copy, accor^ing to which we must di^ect and order not only our
Faith, but all our Doing not following such other rules as will not warran^ our
actions. Not 1 His secret will.


Now these Rules are, (...) The secret will of God, (...) The will and Example
(...) other, 3. Our own will an^ wisdom.

1. Gods secret will, thoug^ we do conformably there unto, will not justify
o^^ actions, either good or bad Not good, because the^ are not of Faith; and so
may say that Gods written Word, not understood a^ right, is for the true
me^ning of it secret to us. S^ that though we do acco^ding to the true meanin^
of it, yet doing it with doubtful conscience, (...)
a^ not of Faith and certai^ knowledge, it is sin to us.

2. Not bad, To do according to that rule, will not justify our actions,
either good or bad.
for so might Herod and Pontius Pilate, and the people of Israel ^ave been
excused when ^hey crucified Christ, seeing ^^ey were gathered together for to
do whatsoever ^he hand and counsel of ^od determined before to ^e done, to
justify our ^ctions from Gods secret ^il, were too saucy; Neither ^ust we
desperately live by that rule, saying: If I be ^aedestinat to Life, live as I
^st, I shall not miss of Lif; ^f not, all my endeavors are a vain, I cannot
alter Gods ^ounsell. Wretched Crea^ure art thou, who so rea^nest; Do thou not
make Gods secret will thy rule?

Suppose there were no^^ing else to stop thy ^outh, tell me: how know thou
thy self to be (...) probated? Yea, or elected For so thou must needs a^sume.
But I am reprobate^ Yea, or I am elected; B^ when did ever God te^ thee, (if
any,) that thou a^ a reprobate? that conce^ning particular persons, ^ a secret
kept to himself till the event and end d^clare it; And no man c^ know himself
elected wh^^ lest he lives so careles^ and reasons so prophanel^ Thy rule then
is, believ^ repent, etc. And so the shall be saved, and happ^ are ye, if ye
do the things.

2. The will and conmmand of others, 2 Not the will and command of others. Mar.
15.12, 13, 15.
will not e^cuse us, neither must be a^ rule unto us, as yet Pila^ made it to
himself, in delivering Christ to the Jews ^o be crucified, saying, What ^ill
ye that I do unto him? etc. And they cried: Crucify him, Crucify him. So he
^elivered him to be cru^^fied.

So Math. 28.18. the Soul^iers hired for money, did ^s they were taught, etc.
(...) the (...).


The like I may say con^erning the Example of other men, many or great, ill ^r
good; Yea of Christ himself simply, without his lord, see Mat. 23.3. And ^uke
9.5. Will thou that wee^^mmand Fire to come down ^^om Heaven and consume ^^em?
even as Elias did.

3. Our own will and ^isdome, as to say, Neither our own will or wisdom.
we will ^ertainly do whatsoever ^ing goes forth out of ^ur own mouth, etc.
as Ier. 44.17. So Paul before his Conversion (as man^ now in like case) I
veri^^ thought with my self, Acts 26.9.10.14.
that (...) ought to do many things contrary to the Name of Jesus (...)
Nazareth, which thing I al^ did, etc. And yet so doin^ he persecuted Christ,
an^ kicked against the pricks.

The things made know^ to us then, being the rule o^ our practice, we are to
b^ excited to live, practice, and do according to that rule* and that the
rather, that we thus may get some comfortable testimony, that ou^ knowledge and
profession is sound; Yea especially because as here we are told, Happy are we
if we doeso.

SECTION 2.
BUt here, 1. Two main doubts propounded and answered in this Treatise. 1.
Whether Gods promises be doubtful, because conditional?
It may be objected: of what validity is this motive from blessedness, or what
comfort or encouragement to weldoing can this be, when blessedness here is
promised only upon condition: ^f ye do them? What blessedness is this, which
(seems) thus to depend on ^ffs and Ands?

2. It may be asked, Whether it be in our power to keep the conditions, and to
do the things required. And if not, to what end are such precep^s and
^^hortations.
whether it be in our power to keep and perform these Conditions, and indeed
to do these things, seeing its here required of us; and ^f we be not able of
our selves to do such things, to what end is it that God requires them at our
hands, or exhorts and excites us to the doing of them?

To the former I answer: This Condition here seems indeed to make the
Happiness of Saints doubtful, seeing Happine is not here or elsewhere in the
Gospel promised, but upon Condition, and that both of our doing (as doing has
been explained already) and of our continuance and perseverance in weldoing.
Concerning the validity of Gods conditional promses and force of the motives
thence to w^ldoing, ^c. Ge. 4.7 J^hn 7.17. Happ^nesse from sed (...) weldoing.
La. 13 9.2 I et. 1.10 And to constance therem. Gas. 6.9.


For the first, if thou dosi^ well, (that is, repentest, believe, and
becomest sincere,) shall thou not be accepted? Or shall there not be a
r^mission, said God to Caine? who yet not doing well, found no acceptance.

And says our Savior Christ: If any man will do ^is will, he shall know of
the Doctrine, etc. And if it bear ^ruit, well, (thou may spare ^t) and if
not, then after that ^hou shall cut it down; and if ye do these things, ^ee
shall never fall. And for perseverance: be not wea^y of weldoing, for in due
^eason, we shall reap if we faint ^ot.

But not withstanding such ^onditionall promises we ^re taught by the same
mouth and pen, Yet is not the Happiness of the Elect uncertain either in it
self.
that the ^eaping the blessedness, ^he acceptance here, and ^he Eternal^
Salvation of Gods people and Elect is not barely doubtful, either ^n it self,
or yet always to them after their effectual ca^ling.

1. Not in it self, seeing i^ depends not on man barely, but upon another
cause and ground; namely, on Gods eternal and immutable decree of Election, 2 Thessalonians. 2.13.
who has from the beginning chosen them to salvation through sanctification of
the Spirit, and belief of the truth. Which two (sanctification and Faith* and
so repentance, obedience, and perseverance in them all) as he requires them
of us, as Condition^ and Means of Life and Salvation; so does he also
promise, and by virtue o^ his election effect these conditions in us; as we
shall anon see in the particulars.

2. Not to them, Or to them always after Conversion.
after their effectual calling; And that the Conditions fore named, (not of
their Election, but) of their Salvation, be fulfilled in them; And, through
Gods grace, by them: For so their Election (yea and Salvation unto which they
are elected) is also sure to them; For (since S Peter) if ye do these things
ye shall never fall, (as we heard even now.

So that here we may take notice, How Gods word speaks differently of the
same things.
that the Scripture speaks of the same things differently, some times as
required of us, otherwhiles as promised by himself; sometimes as duties and as
our works, other whiles as blessings and his own works; sometimes as the
graces required, and the glory promised, may be called the Fruit of the
Gospel, and the effects of the Ministry, as the instrument, otherwhiles as
effects of his own eternal decree of Election, and good purpose toward us in
Christ; and so sometimes as belonging to the execution of his eternal decree,
otherwhiles as belonging to his eternal decree to be executed; sometimes as he
is pleased to make them known to us in his word and will revealed, showing
what he requires of us, and what is and will be pleasing unto him, otherwhiles
as he has purposed in himself from all eternity to work them; sometimes as
in common propounded to all in the Church, otherwhiles as proper to his own
peculiar, in whom he will glorify his mercy; And ^ence it is that sometimes ^is
promises are propoun^ed with condition, otherwhiles without condition ^bsolutly
and indepen^antly.

God knows who are his, and what he will do himself, and accordingly he
works all his works, as ^epending merely on his own, most wise, just,
gra^ious, and good will and pleasure, which nothing can or shall hinder, or
disappoint; And so with reference to his own counsel and purpose, he speaks
absolutely, and as things shall be: Yet for the effecting of his purpose, he
dispenses things in his word* as he pleases by propounding things generally
to all promiscuously in the Church, (passing by others as he pleases) and
that with and under condition, and so as (for ought at least we know) they may
or may not be, as the event also does declare, and yet in regard of his elect
ones all his purposes (and promises) of grace and glory shall most undoubtedly
take place, and they shall not miss of that Salvation, whereunto (through
Faith and Sanctification of the Spirit) they were elected.

This course (because w^ see it and do observe it in the Scripture) we must
conceive God has thought fittest for the manifestation of his glory, by
showing forth his mercy, Justice* Liberty, and other his attributes.

Now if we understand and conceive it not so well as we would, yet should we
not by any means question it, or frame things as we please according to our
easiest apprehension, but rather rest (denying our own reason, judgment,
will,) in that we see to be the course which God pleases to take.

And this is that which now we come particu^arly to show and prove ^ut of his
Word, Two considerations for the clearing of the first doubt.
preparing ^he way, and endeavour^ng to make all plain, by ^andling of two
maine Considerations.

SECT. 3.
First, Gods promises distingu^ shed: some are of the End, or of Happ^nesse.
Acts 16.21 Re. 2.10. And these are condition all. Psalm. 1.1. Psalm. 119.1.2.
Ich. 20.19. To. 4.7.8. Psalm. 32.1. 2. Mat. 24.26.
Consider that God promises in Scripture a^ either of the End, or (...) the
means leading to the end.

Now first the promise concerning the End, as especially concerning Salvation
and blessedness, an^ with Condition, as: Believ^ and thou shall be saved;
(...) thou faithful unto death, an^ I will give thee a Crown (...) Life; Or
because here i^ mention of blessedness, thi^ happiness is promised with
Condition of Doing and o^ Evangelicall obedience (...) Happy are ye if you do
them. So elsewhere upon the condition of obedience, negative; Blessed is the
man that walks not in the counsel of the ungodly, etc.

2. Affirmative: Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the Law of
the Lord. So it is promised upon the condition of Faith; Blessed are they that
have (not seen and yet have) believed; of the pardon of sin: Blessed are
they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered; And of
perseverance and constancy until the day of Jesus Christ; Blessed is that
servant whom his Lord when he comes shall find so doing.

Now these promises being conditional, all partake not of the End (which is
Salvation) because all (partake not of, nor) keep the condition, none indeed
being able of himself to keep any of those conditions; It is not in man's
power to do good, to believe, Repent, Persevere, as of himself, (the proof
of this will follow anon) and God is not now bound to give thi^ power to all,
but to whom only he pleases.

2. But now God has also made promises, Some are of the Means, and they are
absolute.
which are most free and absolute, of giving where and to whom he pleases all
the Conditions and Meane^ themselves of Life, which he himself works in us*
that so by these means we might attain to the End, as Deuteronomy. 30.6. The Lord
thy God will circumcise thy heart, and the heart of thy Seed to love the Lord
thy GOD, with all thy heart and with all thy soul, that thou may live.

Where the end promised ^s life, Suffrag. Britannor^^ de 5. Artic. These.
Heterodoxa. 1.
which the Israelites shall never attain, unless ^his Condition of loving God
were kept; But God does here absolutely pro^nise, that he himself will give
unto them this Condition, and accordingly will circumcise their hearts to love
the Lord.

So, in like manner as we have heard, God promises Blessedness, to weldoing,
to Faith, Repentance, Perseverance, etc. which are also Conditions required of
us; And this is the tenor of the Gospel, yet he also promises to give Faith,
Repentance, power to do well, with the act of weldoing and perseverance, with
all other Means and Conditions, and that without Condition, without Iffs and
Ands, and absolutely.

So that these Graces and Means of salvation are no^ gifts given or promised,
and offered upon Condition but absolutely; Gods promises concerning these Means
of salvation and blessedness* as is said, are absolute, and are of such gifts
and graces as which God (seeing ou^ impotency and inability to attain the End
without the means, as also to perform the Conditions, and to use the Means
as of our selves, and by our own strength and power) does promise to perform,
or wi^ enable us to perform. This will also be more evident anon in the
particular instances.

SECT. 4.
But before I further pro^eed, A digression further clearing, and justifying
the aforesaid distinction from the imput^^io^ of Libertinisme.
it will be needful to ^indicate what has been ^ught from such inferences ^s
some mistaking or rather ^avelling at this Doctrine and difference of the
pro^nises, may make, yea have ^lready made; As if because it is said (as shall
be proved anon) that the graces of Faith, repentance, etc. are promised
absolutely, without Iffs and Ands, or without respect to Conditions in man,
that therefore a door is hence opened to Libertinisme and Swenckfel^dianisme,
whereby the foundations of Christianity are overthrown, in as much as men are
thus taught to neglect the hearing of Gods Word and of the Gospel preached,
not to regard meekness in receiving the Word and Humility, unto which grace
is promised* Yea even as they would have it, the grace of Election.

I answer: No such things can rightly without wilful^ cavilling be inferred
hence.

For first, That life is not premised but upon condition, does exclude all
neglect of means.
(not to speak that none oppose Libertinisme, Familisme, and contempt or
neglect of the means of the hearing and reading of the Gospel more then those
that use this distinction of the promises) this very Doctrine (that the promise
of salvation is made upon condition, and made good to none (being otherwise
capable) but to those that carefully use all the means ordained and appointed
to salvati^n) excludes all carelessenes and neglect of means, one ^r other,
seeing we teach ^en according to the ^criptures; Gal. 6.7.8.9.
That whatsoever (...) man sows, that shall he ^ap, etc. And that we are ^t
to be weary of weldoing. Without which constancy ^o reaping can be expected;
and that we ought to give ^rnest heed to the things we ^are, for how else can
we es^pe if we neglect so great Sal^tion? etc. Heb. 2.1.2.3.
This we shall ^rther show and urge in ^e Conclusion of all.

2 But now chiefly con^rning the absolute pro^ise of giving the means ^d
effecting the Conditi^ns, concerning the absolute promises of the means.
on which blessedness ^d Salvation is promised. (...) I say, 1. Seeing
salvation and blessedness is the mai^ end instanced in, and the chief end
respecting man that the means appointe^ of God thereunto, The means being
many, must not be divided.
being many, are not to be severed and divided one from another, but to be
consid^red conjoynedly and all^ them, with relation to the^ maine end, and that
therefore as they are means (...) Salvation, (whether the have a nearer
connexi^ with life, as Faith, Repe^tance^, Justification, and^ Or be further
off, as t^ Gospel it self, our heari^ of it, and common and g^nerall grace
wrought by (...) they all of them conjoy^edly and with respect (...) their
maine end, are p^^mised absolutely and wit^out condition, though (...) (...)
self, as man's chief end, ^e not promised in the Gospel, but upon such
^onditions.

2 We may yet consider that these same conditions, Yet they may and must be
compared, and so some graces may be considered as Ends and effects of former
and more common graces such as is the Gospel, etc.
which all of them have their reference to Salvati^n, as the Means thereof,
^ay yet be compared one ^ith another; And so some, (...) regard of such
relation, ^ay be considered as par^ular and Mean Ends, and ^ffects of some
preceding ^uifts, which God has or ^ained as Means more im^ediately of such
graces, ^t as means also more re^otely of the maine End, ^d of salvation: So
Faith, ^epentance, Holiness, ^erseverance, which are ^eanes of blessedness
and ^lvation, and Conditions of eternal Life, may be^ considered also as the
End^ and effects of other grace^ and gifts of God; and (...) not given or
promised b^^ upon some Conditions which must be used (...) means more
immediately respecting those mean^ ends, and which have reference not only
further o^ to the maine end, Salvat^on, but more nearly to the^ intermidle
ends, of Fait^ Repentance, etc. For L^gick and nature teache^ us, that there is
the le^ and utmost end, which (...) chiefly intended and ayme^ at, Finis
ultimus, (...); or (...) and
unto which all mean^ are ordained, and there an intermidle end: a mai^ end,
and a mean end, whi^ is the Act and instrument (...) the efficient cause, by
whi^ ^e in tends to attain to the maine and last end.

The former in this busi^esse now in hand, Finis intermedius to finis ad finem,
fine propter finem.
is eter^all Life, unto which we ^re elected; The latter are ^aith, and other
graces ^named, which as they are ^meanes of Life and blessed, ^esse, so are
they effects and ^nds intended, which God works and intends by the Gospel and
word sent, preached, and received, or ^ttended to: So that the Gospel is the
means by which we attain first to these graces, and then to Salvation, by
which God ^rings us to, and works Faith, Romans 10.17 Ioh 17.17. Luke 3.5.1
Cor. 10.4.5.
(for Faith comes by ^earing, and hearing by the Word of God,) and so
Sanctification; So says Christ: Sanctify them through thy truth, thy word is
truth. And so Humility, for it is God^ voice in and by the Ministry, whereby
every m^^taine and hill is brough^ low, etc.

This is one of those weapons, if not chief, which pulls down strong hold^ and
casts down imaginations, and every high thing which exalts it self against
the knowledge (...) God.

Thus then the Gospelli^ a means of these and other graces, as the next end
thereof, as of Salvation i^ self more remotely; and these graces being
considered as the next and more immediate Ends of the Gospel, have their
conditions, which must not bee^ neglected, as the hearing of ^he word, and
attending ^ereunto, etc. Yet the same ^aces of Faith, etc. are to ^e considered
also, and ^hiefly as means of eter^all Life, and as Conditi^ns thereof; which
there^re as means of Life and ^essednesse, and as Condi^ons of the new
Covenant (...) Life, are promised by ^od absolutely and with^t condition;
though as ^bordinate and intermidle ^ds, they depend also (or^narily) on their
Means ^d Conditions.

Thirdly, I say, Yet the promises of the end, whether maine end or mean end,
^s (...) end, are ever Conditional. And the promises of the mean^s as means
ever absolute, whether they be remote or nearer.
yet that ^hether we speak of the ^iefe and last end, or of ^e mean and middle
end, ^at it is true which was ^d: That the promise of ^e end, as it is the end,
is ^th Condition; and the promise of the Mean (whether nearer or furthe^ off)
as means is absolute and without condition; S^ that let the Condition b^ what
it will be, whether^ the maine end, or meane^ middle ends, yet God do^ both
freely promise, an^ freely give and effect i^ and that whether it have more
necessary and infa^lible connection with i^ end, as true Faith, Remi^sion and
Sanctification have or doubtful only and uncertain (inregard of us) a^ the
preaching of the Go^pell) by which yet all and each are not converted which yet
in regard o^ Gods Elect, and of h^ chief intent in sending it is made
effectual by God, and so promised without condition.

Fourthly, then I avow ^oncerning the Gospel, The Gospel it self is
absolutely. Rom 10.17 1 Ioh. 1.9. James 2.6
the ^earing, and receiving of ^, (as also concerning all ^uch things as may be
called ^ore remote means of ^fe, or conditions of Faith, which hearing; is of
Remis^on, which Confession is; ^f more grace, which Hu^^ity is, etc.) that it
(as ^ese other) is both freely ^omised, and freely given, ^th in regard of the
outa^d means, and of the in^a^d work and effect of it.

1 The Gospel and out^ard means are freely and ^solutely promised (even (...)
was Christ himself the ^essed Seed, Genesis 3.15.) 1 Promised.
and (...) the calling of us Gentiles, (...) partake of it. In the last ^yes
the mountain of the ^rds House shall be established in the top of the
Mountains; I^a. 2, 2, 3.
and all Nations shall flow unto it, etc. So Christ is promised to be given for
a Covenant of the people: For a light to the Gentiles, Isa. 2.6, 7 and 49.5, 6.
etc. (...). 66.18.13.20.
to open the blind eyes, etc. I will gather all Nations and Tongues, and they
shall com^ and see my glory; and I wi^^ set a sign among them; an^ they shall
bring all your brethren for an offering unto the Lord out of all Nations, etc.

Secondly, Freely given (...) (...) the out w^rd min^stery. R^^. 10 1^ 1^.
the Gospel^ and the preaching there^^ is freely given of God and sent, without
which, how should men come to Faith or calling upon God, or ye^ any other
grace? For h^^ shall they call on him in who^ they have not believed? and he^
shall they believe in him, (...) whom they have not heard (...) and how shall
they hear without a preacher? and how shall ^ey preach, except they be ^^nt?

Therefore says our Savior to his Apostles: Mat. 28, 19 20. Mare. 16, 15,
Go ^e and teach all Nations, etc. and go ye into all the World, ^d preach
the Gospel to eve^^ Creature.

Yet this is done, Which is directed by special choice, and sent to some, not
to all.
both ^eely (in regard of the first ^oving cause, Gods only ^mpassion and
love,) and ^th choice, in regard of ^e Nations, to which in ^eir several and
fit times ^e Gospel is sent, not to ^ch Nation at once, and (...) some scarce
at all. Yet ^hosoever they are that at ^y time enjoy the Gospel ^d outward
means, they ^ve them from the free ^ercies and goodness of God, they were not
mo^^ worthy then others; Neither is it because God di^ foresee they would prof^
by the Gospel more the^ others. Why was it the^ sent and preached first t^
Israel, a gainsaying people (otherwise then for the^ further conviction,) and
n^ to the Tyrians and Sydon^ans, who (if like might works, which were wrough^
to confirm the Gospe^ had been done amon^ them which were done^ Corazin and
Bethsaid^ would have repented lo^ ago; Math. 1^.21.
Which yet Israel d^ not.

But this is from Gods fre^ choice, who (according (...) his wise and just
Counsel^ sends it to this or the place (where he has mu^ people, Act. 18.9,
10.
at least some, to call and gather by it) and purposely as he pleases, will
not, (or will not as yet) have it come to some other people.

Thus when Paul and Sylas had gone throughout Phrygia, Act. 16.6 7.
and the region of Gallatia, (preaching the Gospel,) they were forbidden of
the holy Ghost to preach the Word in Asia; after they were come to Misia, they
assayed to go into Bithinia, but the Spirit suffered them not.

3 Among those, And for the inwa^ work and ower of^
whither the Gospel is sent, God gives grace effectually to receive, and with
meek, humble, and good hearts, to entertain it, not to all, but to whom he
pleases. Thus among those that heard Paul preach at Philippi, Act. 16.14
its noted (only) of Lydia, that the Lord opened her heart, that she attended
unto the things which were spoken of Paul.

And who are called effectually (as being vessels of mercy, which God had a
fore prepared unto glory,) not all Jews, not all Gentiles, but us, says Paul,
whom he has called of the Jews and of the Gentiles, and not of the Jews
only, but also of the Gentiles.

Therefore the Light of the Gospel, Romans 9 23. ^
and saving revelation of the mystery of it, and the giving of wisdom by it
is made to be the gift of Gods free grace by Christ: In whom we have
redemption through his bloo^, ^he forgiveness of sins, Ephesians. 1.7, 8, 9.
according to the riches of his grace, wherein he has abounded toward us in
all wisdom and prudence, having made known to us the mystery of his will,
according to his good pleasure, which he has purposed in himself, etc. So,
Mat. 11.25, 26.
I thank thee, Oh Father, says Christ, because thou have hid these things
from the wise and prudent, and have revealed them to Babes; Even so Father, for
so it seemed good in thy sight.

Now if Gods Word prove fruitful, L^k. 8.15. Iam. 1.17
and the effect of it show it self only in those who receive and hear it in
an honest and good heart. I would ask from whom is this good heart? Is it not
from him from whom is every good gift, and every perfect gift, etc.?

We conclude then this digression (occasioned by an unjust cavil) and say,
What God requires as a Condition, he also works in the Elect.
that though Gods promise of Salvation, yea and of Faith, and other graces,
wrought ordinarily by the ministry, be propounded with Condition, yet the
Conditions themselves and the Means of Salvation whether more immediate as our
effectual calling, Repentance, Faith, regeneration, justification, etc. or
mediate and remote, are both promised and effected in us, without Condition, as
being not made to depend upon man, Mediasalutis immediata, and u^^dis mediorum.
either for the giving or the working and effecting of them in him, and so for
other like particulars; God promises forgiveness of sin, to such as do
confess, forsake, and repent thereof; but who gives repentance, etc. does not
God? Ezekiel. 36.26.31. and Zach. 12 10. God requires our prayers, and will scarce
give us any good thing, unless we ask it, Matt. 7.7. Ask and it shall be
given you; As Confession. 1 Ioh. 1.9
And Ezekiel. 36. after a most free and gracious promise made by God of working
all grace in our hearts, and giving both Spiritual and Temporal Blessings.
Verse. 25.26. and 27. etc. Yet thus says the Lord: Prayer. Romans 10.14. and 8.26.
I will yet for this be enquired of by the house of Israel to do it for them.
But who gives this gift of prayer? only he that gives Faith, out of which
prayer flows, only God by his Spirit; Zach. 12.10. Romans 8.26. We know not
what we^ should pray for as we ought; but the spirit it self makes
intercession for us, etc.

Lastly, God gives grace (...) the humble; that is, more grace, James 4.6. But
when gives the grace of Humility? Humility.
Does not the Spirit (...) Gal. 5.22. Of which more afterward.

I say then of all these though God promise not good things to his Church but
upon Conditions, and in the use of Means, which to neglect, and yet to expect
the end, were presu^ption and to tempt God, yea to come short of it, yet
Gofreely and absolutely promises to give, Heb. 4* 1.2.
and make effectual the Condition and Means themselves.

Let this suffice for the present, till we make it more evident anon.

SECTION. 5.
TO proceed: These promises concerning the means depend on Gods election.
these promises of the means, and of fulfilling the conditions in ^s, depend
upon Gods de^ree and Election, which is ^ot conditional, though ^is word be.
His order in ^ecting us to life is not the ^me which he observes (...)
promising and giving ^fe; He promises it upon ^ondition, and gives it not ^ut
upon performance of ^^ch Condition; But he ^ust not therefore be ^ought to
elect us conditionally, or upon the fore^ght of such conditions ^rought in us,
or by us. Which his election is not conditional.


To teach (which yet some teach) that God is so to be conceived to decree, as
he does execute his decree were to invert the order^ things.

Indeed in the executi^^ and in the Gospel, Armin. contra Iun. proposit. 19
he w^ have no man to attain (...) end without the mean^ and without such
conditions as he requires, yea^ he may and does require^ all; (which is one
reas^ why the promises are, (...) they should be, propo^ded in Scripture,
Though his Word be.
and (...) the Gospel preached, generally and promiscuou^ to all in the
Church;) a^^ God has also so decre^ to bring men to Salvation by such means;
But (...) this is not the whole a^ entire decree of Go^ which implies his
predes^ nation of certain singular and definite persons, who are known to
God, and se^ered from others by the decree of his election, whereby he has
absolutely and only according to ^is own counsel chosen ^^em to Salvation;
unto which yet he (for the execution of his Decree) will ^ring them by means,
and by the observation of such Conditions, as he will pro^ound and require in
the Gospel, on the perfor^ance of which he promi^eth this salvation to all in
^he Church, but works them only in his Elect. Concerning which Election we
thus read: Mat 20.^6.
Many are cal^ed, but few are chosen. And the foundation of God stands sure,
having this Seal, the Lord knows them that a^ his; 2 Timothy 2.19 Romans 11.5
And so we are told of Remnant according to the (...) lection of Grace.

Otherwise (if God Election were only conditional) it might so fall ou^ that
all might be reprob^ted, that his Church might fail on earth, yea an^ Christ
should be no certai^ Head, as having no certain^ members assigned unt^ him.

But God in the matter (...) our Salvation does also u^ his absolute will in
bringing his Elect to the end appointed, powerfully an^ most infallibly.

Christ says, Lu^e 12.32.
it is you Fathers good pleasure (...) give you a Kingdom; and you have not
chosen me, b^^ J have chosen you.

This could not be true, John 15, 16
(...) Gods will were in this ^ase only conditional. For ^^ough God in his
word ^romiseth life and blessed^esse under condition of ^aith and Holiness,
yet he ^ecrees nothing under any ^oubtfull or uncertain ^ondition.

God in his word tells us that we should do, and ^ow we may hope to at^ine
to salvation, and to assu^ance of our Election; but (...) his decree he sets
down that he himself will do, according to which he works and effects that
grace in his Elect, which he ^equires of them (yea of ^ll) leaving others in
his justice, to their own hard^esse.

SECT. 6.
YEt first he does no^ mock such as do not through their own obstinacy or
inability keep the conditions; Yet first, God mocks none in his Word.
But most certainly if they do keep and do that which is required (as once
they were able to have obeyed God in hi^ hardest command, and sti^^ stand bound
so to do) they shall undoubtedly be saved; therefore was it said even to
Cain: Genesis 4.7.
If thou do^^ well, shall thou not be accepted^ Gods promises of life are
conditional.

Yea in such command^ God does not delude, bu^ reprove and convince such men of
unbeleefe, and tha^ in his Justice.

And secondly, His Word and decree are not contrary one to another.
neither are ^he decree and Word of ^od contrary or repugnant ^^ch to other,
but only ^bordinate. God makes ^s word subservient to his ^ecree, and reveals
so much (...) his own counsel and ^rpose, and in that man ^er as he
pleases, and so (...) may best serve his own ^ds, which if we cannot ^e by
his Word, yet must ^e not search, much less ^arrel, with God therea^ut, or
frame his decrees ^cording to our own con^its.

God in commanding du^es at men's hands, has ^metimes other ends, then
^edience, (though that ^ely be the thing which (...) are to look unto, as
re^ired of us, in and by his word,) his precepts are also sometimes for trial,
as th^^ commandment given t^ Abraham, Genesis 22.2.
of Sacrificing h^^ Son.

Sometimes for Convicti^ on, whereby he intends (...) convince his Creature
(...) disobedience, yea of i^ own inability, etc. as (...) bidding Pharaoh,
let the people go.

These Ends he keep secret to himself, Exodus 8.1
(as the^ may respect this or th^^ particular person,) an^ therefore though his
pr^cept seem to cross h^ secret pleasure and purpo^^ (which the event decla^^
at length what it was,) (...) our ignorance must not cau^ us quarrel with God,
b^ Faith should reconcile the seeming contrariety.

The like is true in Gods ^ormises and threats where ^he exceptions and
Condi^ions are often concealed and kept secret to God ^imselfe. If God then
re^eales part of his will and ^onceales part, this is neither to contradict
himself, ^or to deal doubly and ^eceitfully with his Crea^ure. He speaks not
one thing and means another; ^ut speaks that which con^erneth us to take
notice ^f, and conceales that which ^e will do himself, and which he has
absolutely ^et down with himself, ^specially concerning the ^alvation of
those whom (...) mercy he will save, and (...) time effectually call; and ^he
just desertion of those whom he in justice will leave in the mass of
perdition, See who list Dr. Crackanthorpes Sermon of praedestination, page 15,
16.
and therefore not give his grace effectually unto them. I may therefore sa^
the Conditional part o^ Gods will is set down i^ his word; But what he hat^
set down absolutely, and whom in particular he wi^^ save, and imprint Faith
an^ Holiness in their heart^ he has reserved to him self, (as not being
boun^ to reveal it till the eve^ show it,) only that there such an absolute
will i^ God, is revealed, as we have already showed.

SECT. 7.
SO that now, though (...) regard of the word a^^ work of the minister things
may go with (...) and Ands, and that the conditions in regard of man whose
actions proceeding ^f judgment, and having their beginning from with^n his
will, are voluntary) ^ay, or may not be done or ^erformed; Yet as they are Gods
works (though required of us) and effects of ^is Election, (who chan^eth
without violence our ^ills) he speaks of them without Iffs, and promises
them absolutely, yea and ^ccordingly works and ^ffecteth them himself.

And so again things may ^emaine in themselves in^ifferent, to fall out this
^ay or that way, notwith^tanding Gods decree or working infallibly this or that.

The certainty of Gods decree does not abolish the consent of man's will, Gods
decree does not take away the consent and liberty of man's will.
bu^ rather order it, and mildely incline or draw it forth^ man's freedom of
will man well stand, with that necessity which is of infallibility, or of
consequence, and man's actions may be free, though otherwise in respect of Gods
will they be of unchangeable necessity.

Gods decree takes not away all possibility to the contrary event, (...)
voluntarii ^i^iscie^^e and voluntario committatur, Greg. Armin. lib. 2. did.
29. in fine.
but only the contrary event it self, as his decree before all worlds, that
at this timel^ should preach in this place on this argument, at this time, did
not take from me, ever since, all possibility of not preaching at this time;
(for I might have been absent, or otherwise determined;) But it took from me
the actual not preaching at this time.

I do this certainly and infallibly, but yet freely; Gods decree takes from me
the contrary event; so that (in sensu composito) these two cannot stand
together, God has decreed that at this moment, I should be preaching these
things; and I do not at this moment, preach these things; But (in sensu
diviso) these two may consist together; God decreed that I should preach these
things at this moment, and I had power not to preach these things at this
moment if I had pleased.

Now if this sound harsh to any, Praescientia Dei falli non potest.
let it be considered the like inconvenien^^ would follow upon God bare
prescience, (which none denies,) and his prescience may as well hen^^ be denied
as his praede fi^^tions; Seeing Gods prescience is as infallible as hi^ Decree
is immutable. And thus much for the first consideration.

SECT. 8.
2 WE may now secondly consider, The second consideration making good the
former.
that in Gods new Covenant of Grace, the condition required of us, (...) also
part of Gods Covenan^ and promise made unto us. So that this is one maine
difference between the Law (strictly taken according to the Condition of
works,) and the Gospel preached both before and after the death of Christ,
that the Law promises Life, and requires perfect obedience, but neither
promises nor gives power to perform what it requires; ^t leaves a man wholly
to himself, and to his own power.

But the Gospel and new Covenant promises the ^ame life upon new and other
conditions, The conditions required of us, are also part of Gods Covenant and
promise made unto us. Difference between the Law and the Gospel.
no less (I ^ke) hard in themselves and impossible to us to perform aright by
our own ^rength then the other, and that is upon condition of ^aith,
Repentance, Holi^esse, and Perseverance in ^^em all; Yet so as that it ^oth
promises and gives power to keep and perform the Conditions (this latter
depending on Gods Election) in which regard it is said, that the law made
nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did, and that Christ is
the Mediator of a better Covenant, which is established on better promises,
And why better? But because wh^^ the Law could not do, Heb. 7.19 and 8.6. Romans
8.2.3
in the it was weak, through the flesh is done by the Law of the Spirit of
Life in Christ Jesus, who^ God sent, etc.

The first Covenant (...) said to be faulty, yet not (...) it self, for says
the Scripture, the Lord finding fau^^ with them, (not with (...) barely) says,
the day^ come when I will make new Covenant with the house of Israel and Judah;
Heb. 8, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, etc.
not according to the Covenant which I made with their Fathers, because they
continued not in my Covenant (lo, there ^s the fault of it) I regarded them
not, says the Lord; For this is the Covenant that I will make with the House
of Israel, after those days, says the Lord; I will put my Laws unto their
mind, and write them in their hearts, etc.

Thus God promises to ^oe for us what he requires ^f us: At least he requires
^he Fact (or act) of us, and ^e promises the ability, or ^ather indeed he
promises and effects the act also, ^e promises both, to write ^s Laws in
our hearts, and to ^orke all our works for us; as ^^rticularly, not only
power to believe, but the very act of believing, not only (...) posse Credere,
but according to that (...) unto you it is given to believe on him, Phil. 1.29.
and not only (...) believe on him (Christ) (...) also to suffer for his sake.
So not only the power, ability, and will to do good but the will, power and
dee^ too; For it is God that works in you, says Paul, both (...) will and to
do.

SECT. 9.
NOw all that is sai^ both in the form^ and in this latter Consideration, What
God requires, he both promises and works in the Elect.
will better and mo^fully appear by particul^^ instances and proofs, Go^
promising Blessedness a^ Salvation by Christ, 1 requires some Conditions us,
yet, 2. he promises to work and effect the said Conditions in us; and 3. he
does also indeed work the same, and that by virtue of his new Covenant, we
will instance in some principal graces.

1 Faith God (promising Salvation and Happiness) does first require Faith,
This is showed in diverse graces, as in Faith. Which God Romans 10.9.1 requires
Mark 9.23
as the Condition; and so promises life upon that Condition* and that with an
If, (as in my Text) saying: If thou shall confess with thy mouth the Lord
Jesus, and if thou shall believe in thine heart that God has raised him from
the dead, thou shall be saved. So elsewhere, If thou can believe, all things
are possible to him that believes. So also Ioh. 3.16, and Act. 16.30.31.
Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shall be saved. Promises Ier.
31.33. Isa. 53.11.


2. Yet God also does promise Faith; For is not Faith one of those laws, which
God has promised to put into our hearts? By his knowledge shall my righteous
Servant justify many; That is, by the knowledge of him, by which knowledge is
meant faith, or at least such a knowledge as is not without Faith, which is also
promised elsewhere, they shall all know me, of which knowledge that is true,
this is life eternal that they might know thee the only true God, Ier. 31.34.
Ioh. 17 3. Works. Ephesians. 2.8. Phil. 2.13.
and Jesus Christ whom thou have sent.

Yea 3. He works it both for habit and for act. So we read, by grace ye are
saved through Faith, and that not of your selves; For it is the gift of God,
and as we heard, unto you it is given (not only) to believe on him, etc.

SECT. 10.
2. REmission of sins, Remission of sins which requires we should seek 1 Cor.
6.9. with 11. Ioh. 8.24.
which God requires we should seek after, Luke 11.4. and without which (we
know) no Salvation, no blessedness, for as blessedness is made to belong to
such Romans 4.7, 8. So we know that there can be no blessedness, no salvation,
without it. Know ye not that no unrighteeous (that is, such as are not washed
and justified,) shall inherit the Kingdom of God, and to dye in our sins, is
threatened: if we believe not It then has God appointed as a means of life.

2. God promises it, 2 Promises. Ier. 31.34.
saying, I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no
more. And this is my Covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins.

3. He also works it, 3 Works. Isa. 43.35.
I even I am he, that blotteth ou^ thy transgressions for min^ own sake, and I
will n^^ remember thy sins. And wh^ is a God like unto thee, Micah. 7.18 19.
that pardons iniquity, etc. He will subdue our iniquities, etc And of
Christ, it is said: Him has God exalted with his right hand, to be a Prince,
and a Savior, for to give Repentance to Israel and forgivenes of sins. Acts
5.31.


SECT. 11.
3. ANd so for Repentance 1. Repentance which God requires. Ezekiel. 18.21. Ier.
4.1.
God requires ^t, as without which no ^ife, Luke 13.3. Except you ^epent ye
shall all likewise ^erish; God promises life unto it, and upon condition of it
with an If: If the wicked will turn from all his sins that he has
committed, and keep all my Statutes, and do that which is lawful and right,
he shall surely live; he shall not dye; And, if thou will return Oh Israel,
says the Lord, return unto me; and, if thou will put away thine abominations
out of my sight, then shall thou not remove. So Mat. 3.2.8.

2. Yet the same Go^ does promise it, Promises.
saying^ will pour upon the hou^ of David, and upon the inhabitants of
Jerusale^ the Spirit of Grace an^ of Supplications, and the^ shall look upon
me^ whom they have pierce^ and they shall mourn for him as one mourns for
his only son, Zach. 12.10
and shall (...) in bitterness for him, (...) one that is in bitternes^ for
his first borne.

3. Yea he also works (...) he gives it as is now sa^ out of Acts. 5.31. and
else where: Works.
Then has Go^ also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life and it is
preached in h^ name. Luke 24.47. that i^ by his power, Acts 11.18.
Acts 3.12.1^ So that he both appointe^ ^t, to be preached, and works it by
preaching.

SECT. 12.
(...). SO for new Obedience, New obedience which God requires.
and walking in the ways of God in all since^ity and holiness, without which
no man shall see God, ^eb. 12.14.

1. God requires it in his Covenant: Genesis 17.1. Romans 6.3.4.
Walk before me, and be thou perfect, or upright and sincere; So we are buried
with Christ by Baptism unto death, that like as Christ was raised up from the
dead by the glory of the Father, even so also we should walk in newness of
life.

2. Yet God promises this, saying: Promises
This shall be the Covenant that I will make with the House (...) Israel, Ier.
31.33. Ezekiel. 36.26 72.
after those days says the Lord, I will p^^ my Law in their inwar^ parts and
I will write i^ in their hearts, etc. An^ elsewhere, I will put (...) Spirit
within you, an^ cause you to walk in m^ Statutes.

3. Yea he performs it i^ us, Works.
(and for us) according to that: Thou have wrough^ all our works in us (or for
us) Isa. 26.12. causing us indeed to walk in his Statutes, and to bring for^^
good Fruit; For, says Christ: As the branc^ cannot bear Fruit of (...) self,
except it abide i^ the vine; Io^^ 15.4.5.
No more can y^ except ye abide in me; (...) am the vine, ye are the branches;
He that abides in me, and I in him, the same brings forth much Fruit, for
without me ye can do nothing.

SECT. 13.
(...) SO, Perseverance which God requires. Gal 6 9.
for Perseverance and Constancy without which no Crown, no ^eward; 1. God
requires as a Condition of Life and Happiness; be thou Faithful unto the
death, and I will give thee Crown of life, Rev. 2.10. In due season we shall
reap if we faint not. And Christ is said to reconcile us: that he might
present us holy and unblamable, and unproveable in his sight, (especially) at
the day of judgment, (if says the Apostle) ye contin^^ in the Faith, Col.
1.22.23. John 15.6, 7.
grounde^ and settled, and be no^ moved away from the hope of the Gospel, etc.
And elsewhere sai^^ Christ: if a man abide no^ in me, he is cast for^^ etc.
And, if ye abide i^ me, and my words a bi^^ in you, ye shall ask wh^^ ye
will, and it shall b^ done unto you.

2. He yet promises i^ to the great comfort of hi^ people saying: Promises.
I wi^^ make an everlasting Covenant with them, that (...) will not turn away
from them to do them good but I will put my fear i^ their heart, Ier 3.2.40.
that they shall not depart from me* so God will neither turne^ from us, nor
suffer (...) ^o turn from him, though others fall away, and err ^oncerning
the truth, as did Hymeneus and Philetus; ne^erthelesse says The Apostle, 2 Timothy
2.18, 19.
^he foundation of the Lord ^emaines sure, (or steady) ^aving this Seal: The
Lord ^noweth who are his. No ^emptation shall finally pre^aile against such; 1
Cor. 10.13.
For God ^s faithful, who will not suffer ^ou to be Tempted above that ^ee are
able, but will with the Temptation also make a way ^o escape, that ye may be
able ^o bear it. Yea when such ^s trust in God, Jeremy 20, 8.9.
are ready ^o yield (as Jeremy; who because Gods Word was made a reproach to
him, and he was had in derision daily, said he would no longer make mention of
him, nor speak any more in his name,) yet God^ word and Spirit quicke^ them up
again, as they d^^ him; Yea God has sai^ and promised: Isalme 125.3.
The ro^ of the wicked shall no^ rest upon the Lot of the righteous, least the
righteous put forth their hand unto iniquity.

And so Christ has promised the continuance, an^ abode of his grace and hol^
Spirit; John 4.14.
saying: The Wat^ that I shall give him, shall (...) in him a Well of Water,
springing up into everlasting Li^^ See also John 14.16.17. an^ 1 John 2.27. and
3.9.

3. He accordingly work^ it; Works Phil. 1.6. Heb. 12.2.
beginning and perfec^ing his own work; He^ which has begun a goo^ work
in you, will perform^ it, until the day of Ies^^ Christ. This Jesus Christ is
^lled the author (or be^nner) and also the fi^sher of our Faith; Yea (...) us
he speaks most com^rtably: John 6.37.
All that the Father ^eth me, shall come unto (...), and him that comes to
(...), I will in no wise cast out.

SECT. 14.
He like I may say for all (...) other Graces (unto ^^ich Life is promised) ^d
works all, So in other graces: As more especially, humility and meekness
which God requires: James 2.6. 1 Pet. 5.5, 6
as the fear God; Ier. 32.40. Know^ge of God, which is re^red, as in the Text:
if know these things; pro^sed. Ier. 31.34. Given Mat. 27, 28. So for humility
and ^ekenesse, which makes ^argues) men blessed; Bles^ are the meek; Mat. 5.5.
(...). It is required, and Gods promises are made to (...) God gives grace (1.
mo^^ grace) to the humble. A^ elsewhere. Humble yo^ selves therefore under^
mighty hang of God, the he may exalt you in d^^ time. And see Isa. 57.^^ and
66.2. Mat. 18.3.

2. It is promised: Promises Isa. 11.6 and 65.25,
T^^ Wolf shall dwell with (...) Lamb, and the Leopa^ shall lie down with
(...) Kidd; and the Calfe a^ the young Lion, and (...) Fatling together; Yea a^
a little Child shall (...) them; (thus shall the sto^^ be brought down by
(...) Ministry and Ministe^ (otherwise but weak c^ dren, in comparion those
who are humbled their Ministry.)

3. Works.
Yet it is Gods Wo^^ and gift, as are all good ^ings else: James 1.17.
Every good and very perfect gift is from a^ve; etc. Now if it be not perfect
gift, yet its a good ^ft, and therefore from the other of Lights, and given
(...) from without; being a ^od giving, yea a good ^ft; its not called a habit,
if we had it of our selves, ^d from our own indu^y, (...), not (...).
as Philosophy calls ver^es, which it ascribes to ^ns own power.

^o generally it is said (and ^y most truly be applied (...) this differencing
grace (...) Humility, as some would ^ke it) who makes thee (...) differ from
another? and ^at have thou that thou did (...) receive? 1 Cor. 4.7.
And for this ^ekenesse the Apostle ^kes it with love, joy, peace, long
suffering, gentleness, goodness, Faith and temperance, a fruit of Gods saving and
Sanctifying Spir^^ (as these graces are oppose^ to the works of the flesh Gal.
5.22.23. 1 Pet. 5.6.
Yea it is man the work of Gods might Hand, and a gift of Go^ power, Phil.
4.12.
(not of man's) (...) when Paul says, I kn^^ how to be abased, that (...) how
to carry my self, humbly, and meekely, un^^ Gods Hand: When I a^^ want, when I
am hungry, (...) suffer need, this is no other^ effect then that, 1 Peter*
(...) Humble your selves un^^ the mighty Hand of God.

But could Paul doe^ of himself; Verse. 13
No, there^^ he adds concerning (...) (and by occasion of (...) concerning all
things (...) sides,) saying: I can do all ^^ings through Christ that ^engthens
me. Nay I will ad, is meekness and humi^y is a grace flowing from ^ection,
(not preceding (...) going before it,) which ^^erefore we as the Elect of ^d
are bid to put on with ^er graces; For so Paul, put (...) therefore as the
Elect of ^d holy and beloved bow^ls ^^nercy, kindness, humble^^sse of mind,
meekness, etc. and so we will conclude ^is point, and say, that not ^ely
humility and those ^aces mentioned, even ^w out of Col. 3.12.13. Col. 3.12.
(...).
^t all other gifts, graces, ^^d blessings (which have, ^^d so far as they
have ^ecessary connection, with ^ernall life, as being ni^ssary means and
con^dtions of life, Yea all graces given us in time, are according to Gods
Election of us before time. Ephesians. 1.3, 4. John 15.16.
etc.) which do come to us, and are given to us in time, are according to Gods
Election of us before time, as it is said, Ephesians. 1.3, 4. That Ge^ has blessed
us with all Spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ, (1. with Faith,
Justification, Sanctification, Adoption, Saving Knowledge, etc.) according
(...) he has chosen us in hi^ before the foundation of t^^ World, that we
should be Holy and without blame before hi^ in love; Particularly; ability to
do good, and to bring forth good Fruit^ constantly, For so says our Savior:
Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you that you
should go, and bring forth Fruit, and that your Fruit should remain.

Hence we are said to be praedestinated, according to the purpose of him, Ephesians.
1.11.
who works all things according to the counsel of his own will, and thus God
fulfills all the good pleasure of his goodness, 2 These. 1^
and the work of Faith with power. For it it is God (says Paul) which works
in you, Phil. 2.13.
has to will and to do of his good pleasure.

SECT. 15.
ANd this leads the way to (and in part resolves) the second Objection or
question propounded, The second main doubt resolved and it first showed.
whether it be in our power to perform what God commands and exhorts to, and
if not, whether such commands and exhortations be in vain, or no. Seeing then
this blessedness here is urged as a motive to weldoing; It would (a little
further) be considered, whether the doing of these things (such as is named) be
in our power or no; and whether such bare motives, be enough to enable us
hereunto, and to cause us to do that which is ou^ duty in believing,
Converting, Obeying, and Persevering? It may seem^ to be in our power thus to
do, seeing the doing of these things is ascribed to us: Happy are ye if ye
do them.

I answer: That it is not in ma^s power as of himself to do well, and
Convert, etc.
No, iis not i^ our power to do such things as yet God requires of us by way
of command and exhortation: he requires, That we should believe in God, and
in Christ, and that we love one another, 1 John 3.23. That we turn unto him,
Joel. 2.12.13. Iere. 4.1. That we mortify the flesh Col. 3.5. That we cease
to do evil, and learn to do well, Isa. 1.16, 17. and that we work out our
Salvation, Phil. 2.12. But yet we have no power as of our selves to do any of
these things; where ye see I speak not of actions civil, or moral only,
according to man; Concerning which, though the bare doing of them be in the
power of man's will; yet to do them well in respect of all circumstances
required, especially in regard of the end Gods glory (seeing all things, 1 Cor.
10.31.
even our eating, sleeping, recreations must be done to that end (it may be
doubted whether that they may be without sin, and accepted of God, more then
common providence and general assistance be not required.

Thus I may grant, What power he has in civil Actions.
it is in man's power to go to Church, or not, and when the Bell rings to a
Sermon or Service, whether he will repair to the Church upon that Summons, or
go to a Tavern, or walk in the Fields, taking his going to the place of Gods
worship or Temple, as a mere natural action, and as it may be a removal
from one place to another; But to go to the Church, as to the Church, that is,
to that place where God has appointed us to meet him, to hear our prayers,
and to give us instructions and directions for the health of our Souls, and to
go w^^^ a desire, hope, and intent thus to be instructed, and to get good;
This I say must come from more special grace; So that if two or more being
together, one of them when the Bell alike calls and summons all, should leave
the Company, and go to Church, as to Gods House, (as it is said) this must
proceed from more then his own natural power of will, even from such special
grace as was denied to those others.

But we speak of moral actions, according to God, and grace, and of actions
supernatural, such as have reference to Gods glory, and to our Heavenly life
of grace and glory.

SECT. 16.
NOw if we look to what is done, Rom 3.12. Seven degrees to be con^idered in
the perfecting of every good work. Whereof not any one is in manspower the is
not able
and that by man left to himself, we find it most true which is said: There is
none that does good, no not one. Yea and if we look into Gods Word, we shall
find the Scriptures strangely to disable the best of us all, being considered
of and in our selves, and left to our own strength, For whereas there are
Seven degrees to be considered, in the effecting o^ any good thing (as some
^ood Divines have obser^ed) 1, The accomplishing ^r perfecting of it, 2. The
^oing or working of the thing required. 3. The be^inning to do it, 4. To
^peake that which is good, ^. To will, desire, and choose ^, 6. To understand
it, 7. To ^hinke it, we shall find, that ^ot so much as the least of ^hese can
be ascribed to our ^wne power without Gods ^peciall grace.

1. To perfect, finish, 1 To Perfect it.
or perform a good work thoroughly so as to answer our desire and purpose, or
^o persevere in a good work ^o the end; is not from us, ^ut from God; For it is
God, Phil. 1, 6.
who having begun a good work in you (says Paul to the Philippians) will
perform it until the day of Jesus Christ. So Paul concerning himself, to
will is present with me, but how to perform that which is good (that is* how
fully to finish it) I find not. Romans 7.18.
Yea men cannot finish their own evil work always according to their
intent; how much Iesse good works, Genesis 50.20.
as Joseph's Brethren; they thought evil against him, but God meant it unto
good; and so overreached them, so that they came short of their purpose;) So
Paul going toward Damascus, with a purpose to fetch thence, and bring bound to
Jerusalem the Disciples of Christ, Act. 9.1.2. Yet was taken short in the way,
fell down; and in stead of finishing his own wicked intent, he is turned ^o
the Obedience of Christ, ^ot to do or finish his own will, but Christ's;
saying: Lord, Acts 9.6.
what will thou have me ^o do?

2. 2 To do it
We cannot so much as ^oe that which is good without Christ, yea unless we be
ingrafted into him: as ^he Branch cannot bear ^ruit of it self, John 15.4, 5
except it a^ide in the vine; no more can ^ee, except ye abide in me; For
without me (or severed from ^ee) ye can do nothing. The ^ay of man is not in
himself, it is not in man that walks ^o direct his steps, Ier. 10 23.
(...). 10 23. Pro. 16.9.
A man's heart may devise his way, but the Lord directs his steps.

We may know (as in my Text) what to do, but we, ^s of our selves are not able
to do according to our knowledge; Therefore prays David; saying, not only;
Teach me the way of the Statutes, and give me understanding, Psalm. 119.33, 34,
35.
but make me to go^ in the path of thy Commandments. For we are of our
selves not only blind, bu^ lame; and God must teach us, not only to know, but
(...) do; Psalm. 143.10.
Therefore said David again: Teach me to do the will. We have that in us
which till it be removed, hinders us from doing that which otherwise we would
do.

For the flesh lusts against the Spirit. Gal. 5.17. Romans 7.^9.
So that (says Paul) ye cannot do the things the ye would. So he himself
found it; The good that I would (says he) I do not. Isa. 26.12.
(...) therefore ought be done that is good; It is God the works (as
formerly is said) ^ll our works for us and in us.

3 To begin a good work, 3 To begin it. Phil. 1.6.
is not from us (though we ^urpose it) but from the Lord; It is he that
begin^eth a good work in us.

4 To sp^ake what we have thought on and pre^ared, 4 To speak good.
is also from the Lord and not from us; For so wi^e ^alomon concerning them
^oth: The preparation of the ^eart in man and the answer ^f the Tongue, Pro.
16.1.
is from the Lord; And who (what mi^ister especially) finds it not ^hus?

5 As we cannot do, or ^peake and utter; 5 To will it.
so can we ^ot so much as will any thing truly and spiritually good, as not our
own Conversion or Salvation; For It (...) God (says Paul to the Philippians)
which worket^ in you both to will and to do; Phil. 2.13.
But of this more large^ anon.

6 How should man wi^^ that which is good, 6 To conceive it.
as (...) himself, when he cann^ so much as understand o^ perceive it; For so
we are taught: 1 Cor. 2.14.
The natural man receives not the things of (...) Spirit of God, for they are
fo^lishnes unto him; neither (...) he know them, because they (...) spiritually
discerned; Rom, 8.7.
Yea the carnal mind is enmity against God.

7 Lastly, 7 To think it. 2 Cor. 3.^. 1 Cor. 3.19, 20. Psalm. 94.
Nay he cannot think any thing that i^ good; So Paul: We are no^ sufficient
of our selves to think any thing as of ou^ selves, but our sufficiency i^ from
God; Yea man's be^ thoughts are vain; the wisdom of the World is foolishness
with God; And, the Lord knows the thoughts of the wise that they are vain.

All these put together: what is it that man is able as of himself to do,
without Gods special and effectual grace, especially in the matter of
Conversion, Repentance, Faith, etc.

SECT. 17.
NOw the reasons of this our inability to do good, Reasons hereof. 1 His
ignorance.
may partly be gathered and considered ^ut of the foregoing dis^ourse; where
we may take ^otice: First of that Igno^ance (that ill disposed Ig^orance) which
is in us all ^aturally; whereby Repentance, Faith, with the power and life of
Godliness, is accounted foolishness to the natural man* At which, being
called to them he scoffeth and mo^keth. Hence it was tha^ when Hezechiah King
of Judah sent out messenge^ with letters, to call those of Israel to turn
again unt^ the Lord; 2 Chronicles. 30.6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
inviting by man^ fair and gracious promises; in the name and according to the
Word of the Lord* they laughed the messengers to scorn and mocked them.

And do not too many now adays in like manner scoff and laugh at such
teachers as are most earnes^ with them to call them from their sins to a new
course of Life and well-doing? Though yet diverse of ^sher, Manasseth, Verse. 11.
and Zebulon ^umbled themselves, and ^ame to Jerusalem;. But what? By their
own po^wer? No; no otherwise ^hen those of Judah hum^bled themselves; of whom
with those others it is said, and added, that the hand (this notes the work,
yea and power) of God was to give them (that is, all of them both of Judah and
Asher, etc.) one heart to do the commandment of the King and of the Princes,
And 12:
by the word of the Lord; But whence was this backwardness in others (whose
hearts the Lord had not touched otherwise then by those common motives and
exhortations used alike to them all because their corruption (unto which they
were left) told them as the like corruption (where special grace overcomes
not) tells men now that God calls them to forsake their own ways which they
have chosen, and so to deny their own will and choice, to forgo their sweet
sins, and so to undergo such afflictions and reproach as commonly attends upon
Godliness; and a stricter course of Sanctification* Yea the nature of Gods
persuasions is such, as that for the most part they rather dissuade a natural
man, (left to himself) a^, whosoever will come after me, let him deny
himself, and take up his cross and follow me.

And, whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the Gospels, the same shall
save it. Mark 8.34, 35.
This to fleshly, yea to natural understanding, is as much as if Christ should
have said: Fly from me.

2 Secondly, 2 His unbeleefe.
to Ignorance we may add natural unbeleefe, which makes us with Adam rather
fly from God as from a consuming Fire, Heb. 12.29.
then come to him by Faith, Repentance, and by a total resignation of our
selves unto his will.

3 But chiefly, 3 His natural impotency.
when God does inform our ignorance by his word, and also by it gives hope,
and proclaims a pardon freely to the penitent, and to such as shall believe
and become new men. Yet there is that natural impotency in man, whereby he
wants power (now since the Fall) to return or to do any thing which is truly
and spiritually good. Therefore says God: Can the Ethiopian change his skin,
^er. 13.23.
o^ the Leopard his spots? then may ye also do good that are accustomed (or
as it is in the Hebrew, taught) to do evil. The estate of each man before his
Conversion.
In a word, we are dead in sin, and by it; So that if we would know what our
natural estate is before we by Gods special^ grace be effectually called, the
Scripture will plainly and fully tell us, which calls us Servants of sin.
Romans 6.20. And tells us: We are sold under sin, Romans 7.14. That we are by
nature the Children of Wrath, Ephesians. 2.3. Conceived in sin, Psalm. 51.7. That we
drink iniquity as water. Job. 15.16. That our thoughts are only and always
evil. Genesis 6.5.

That our heart is stony. Ez^k. 36.26. that it is perverse and deceitful above
all things, and desperately wicked. Ier. 17.9. that our carnal mind is enmity
against God, and not ^ubject to the Law of God, neither can be. Romans 8.7. Yea
that out of Christ we can do nothing. Ioh. 15.5. And as ^s said, (which may
include all) we are dead in ^respasses and sins. Ephesians. ^.1. Dead in sins,
and ^n the uncircumcision of ^he flesh, Col. 2.13.

^ow surely all these show ^tous, that man's ability ^d power of his own
free^ll, especially in the busi^sse of his own Salvation. is none at all. For
if we be^ Servants of sin, how c^ Liberty stand with this se^ vitude? If
sold under the power of sin, must n^ the Son only make us free^ If we be
conceived in sin^ naturally, then surely the remedy of sin must be sought and
found, not (...) nature, but without it. (...) our thoughts and imagin^tions
be wholly and one^ evil, Showing how unable he is to do good.
can they at all rea^ and lead us to that which truly good? If our hearts ^
naturally stony hearts; (...) they, so remaining admit (...) the Seed of Gods
Wo^ and prove fruitful? M^ they not be made both (...) and good hearts before
the keep the word, they hea^ and bring forth Fruit w^ Patience? Luke 8.15. If
o^ hearts be deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked, what
soundness, sincerity, or rectitude can ^e imagined in us natural^y? If nature
cannot submit ^t self to the Law of God, ^an it (think we) as of it self
either think or do what is truly good? If out of Christ we can do nothing,
can any think that ^ee can do that which is ^hiefe of all, even return
^gaine to God? And if we ^e dead in sin, what sense ^r motion can we have, to
^oe any thing that is truly ^ood?

SECTION. 18.
HEnce we are taught humility, and not to ^lory in our selves, but only in
God; Use of this his impo^encie to teach us humility; to ascribe all to Gods
power, s^bduing our Rebellion.
Yea hence we^ see that man brings nothing to his own Conversion besides the
bare faculty (...) Willing or nilling, which power if he had not, he should
not be so much as ^ man, but as a block or stoc^ incapable of Gods grace^ But,
when a man obe^^ Gods call, the Spirit (...) God so mightily and powerfully
persuades, the the will of man being el^^vated above it self, is bo^
withdrawn from evil, an^ drawn to God and goodness, without any finall^
sistance.

As, (...) ^.13.
when we are bo^ again, this is not of blo^^ nor of the will of the fiel^ nor
of the will of man but of God; (w^ works in us both to (...) end to d^^.) So
when G^ works, it is not left to man's power to use grace well, or to believe,
Repent, and do good or no; as if when God has done all he means to do, man's
will is left in an equipage and even Balance to move it self ^his ways or
that ways, as ^t lists; For so Gods grace should not be praedomi^ant; and
the Conversion of the Elect should be merely contingent: but when God works
the will, we cannot but will; It is not left to us to resist; For God
especially in the work of our Conversion, works so powerfully, as that our
natural resistibili^y, yea and that actual resistance which we make, does
not prevail; neither ^oth it always actually resist; but at that time the
wi^^ yields its consent. So th^^ when we will actually th^^ which is good,
(supposi^^ that God does give us a^ ability to will) yet that willing is not
from our selves.

It is true we (suppose i^ our Conversion) do freel^ assent and will and yield
to the motions of Gods grace^ But the chief question i^ not, Posse velle.
Though we will freely, yet power and act are from him. Sec Doct. Ward; de great.
discriminant. page 23.
whether the will do^ freely yield and give assent to the first motion and
attraction of grace; but whence is that free assent^ not whether we will
freely, but whence it is that we will freely; whether from our own will, or
from Gods effectual grace? It is man that formally wills in every good
work, (yea and this his will it is which does bring and draw out the ^ormall
act of willing,) but ^t is God that so effectually and powerfully moves the
will; that when he Works, then the will most certain^y is wrought and brought
unto act. C^rtit^^^ caus^ (...) (...) (...) (...) (...) (...) (...) (...) nos
(...) ^n fa^imus, Sed ille facit ut saciamuspre be^do (...) voluntati. Aug^^e

So says S. Augu^tine: It is certain that we ^ur selves do will, when we
will, but yet God ma^eth us will that which is good.

And it is certain, Nos ergo volu^^^s, sed Deus in n^^is operatur and ^^lle;
Nos ergo op^ramur, s^^ (...) no^^s ^p^ratur and operari. Aug. (...) bono per se
v^ranti^^, c. 13.
that it ^s we our selves which do any good when we do it, ^ut it is he
that makes us do it, by giving us most effectual ability to our will; and it
is we that will, out God works in us to will; therefore we work, but it is
God that worke^ in us to work, or the ven^ act of working.

SECT. 19:
We must not think^ with some, th^^ God gives only a general and common
grace; and by it gives to us posse si velim^^ power to work if we wi^^ (though
in some sense thi^ may be true, seeing there (...) a certain power ove^ which
the will (where it is) rules, and which it commands; God denies not the
faculty of willing to the wickedst; which make^ their condemnation the more
just: For if they ha^ not such a power, so farr^ they could not have sinne^ so
that there is no man bu^ may be good, or has a power to be good, if he could
will to be good;) But to think we can will of our selves what is good, is
erro^eous; so especially to will, ^s also not to will, or to nill, and by
nilling to resist de ^cto, and indeed Gods ^race.

Gods grace then is more ^hen a gentle swasion, Gods grace is more then a
gen^^^ swasion (...) common influence.
and ^ommon influence, giving ^s a power which we may ^se ^r not use at our
plea^re; So that we may if we will, be redeemed, Believe, ^epent, Persevere.
No, God ^^ves also the will it self, and his grace (as also his in^ention to
save and redeem) ^epends not upon conditi^n, neither is suspended upon the
contingent act of man's Faith and Will.

Grace has its first act i^ the will it self, Haee gratia, a null lo duro
cord respuitur: ideo quippe tribuitur ut cordis duriritia primitus auferatur.
Aug. de praedestin. Sanctor. cap. 8.
which therefore cannot be resisted, because it first works in it the will not
to resist; And surely, that can resist no more, from which is taken away the
will to resist; thus to will is an effect of Grace, and not Grace a^ effect of
the will not resisting. And thus God of unwilling makes us willing Man does not
first will, and then God make him to wi^^ for so we might run bac^ in
infinitum Infinitely.

To will then is a work of Gods special and effectual Grace and power, unto
which his works (...) Grace are ascribed; He being able to do exceeding (...)
dantly above all th^^ (...) think, according to the power that works in us;
Ephesians. 3.10. 2 These. 1.11 The power of Gods grace in giving Faith and working
conversion showed out of Scripture.
unto which power or effectual grace not only Faith it self and Conversion,
but the fulfil^ing of it also is ascribed; For it is God that fulfills all ^he
good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of Faith with power.

Now the power of grace appears in giving the act of faith, and the giving of
the act of Faith, (especially ^f withal we consider the manner of giving it,
and of Conversion; by which all resistance is subdued) proves the power of
grace; seeing the act is not presently given when (...) posse, or the power to
believe if we will, is given; yea though we should grant that the inward and
outward swasion and fit object may carry a man to that which is good, Quoad
specificationem non quoad exercitium actus.
and from that which is evil, (to approve and prefer the one before the
other,) yet they carry him not to the acting of that which is good, or to the
exercise of the act. God exercises his omnipotenc^ in giving the act of Faith
and Conversion. Ephesians. 1: 19.20.
Therefore the Apostle tells us of the exceeding greatness of his power to us
ward, who believe, according to the working of his mighty power, which he
wrought in Christ, when he raised hi^ from the dead. Here we hear of a
power, of the greatness of his power, (...) the exceeding greatness of h^^
power; yea of the might of hi^ power. Whereof such as believe have an
experime^tall feeling and knowledge; it being no other power which raises up
the Soul by a spiritull resurrection from the death of sin by Faith, then
that which raised our blessed Savior in his body out of the grave; For the
Apostle speaks there of a present effect, and not only of Gods power in
raising the dead.

This is that divine power which gives unto us all things that pertain to life
and godliness. 2 P^t. 1.3. Luke 11.21.22. 2 Pet. 5.9. Ephesians. 6.16.
By this power of Christ's grace, the strong man armed is overcome and disarmed,
yea cast out; And so Peter would have us resist Satan, strong and steadfast in
the Faith; this is that shield wherewith we shall be able to quench all the
fiery darts of the wicked, and the Gospel in the power of it, that is, the
preaching of the Word together with the Sword of the Spirit, are the weapons of
our warfare, 2 Cor. 10.4.5. Theophylact. Cajetan. and Anselme in locum.
which are mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds, casting
down imaginations, etc. By these weapons were vanquished and brought to the
Faith: Dionysius the Areopagite, Justin the Philosopher, and Martyr; Pantaenus,
and those many who had used curious arts, who brought their books together,
and burned them, Act. 19.15
the value of which amounted to fifty thousand pieces of silver, that is, to
some eight hundred pounds of our money.

And thus do many find by comfortable experience, the power of Gods Word and
grace converting them to God from such sins as were very powerful and strong
in them; Act. 26.18.
Romans 1.16. 1 Cor. 1.18.
and from the power of Satan; In which regard the preaching of the Gospel is
called, the power of God to salvation, to every one that believes, though to
them that perish it be foolishnes; 2 Cor. 2.4.5 Phil. 1.29.
Yet unto us (says Paul) that are saved it is the power of God; what is? the
preaching of the Cross; which was not (says Paul again) with the enticing
words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power; that
your Faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.
And seeing it is given to us not only to believe on Christ, but also to suffer
for his sake, not only the Act of Faith, is the work of Gods power, but also
our actual suffering with patience for our faith* Hence Paul to Timothy: 2 Timothy
1.8.
Be not as^amed of the Testimony of the Lord, nor of me his prisoner, but be
thou partaker of the affliction of the Gos^^ll, according to the power of God
So he prays that the Colossians might be streng thened with all might, C. l.
1 11.
according to (Gods) glorious power, unto all patience and long suffering with
joyfulnesse.

SECT. 20.
NOw for conclusion of this point; Four absurdities, issuing out of the
Doctrine of common grace.
if Faith, Repentance, and generally the Fruit of Christ's death an^ passion be
only. Conditional; if we will believe, if we will Repent, if we will apply
the Fruit of Christ's death unto our selves, then will these g^osse absurdities
(among many others) follow.

For then first, Our benefit by Christ should be no more certain then that
which we had and lost in Adam.
the Benesit we have by Christ, shall be as uncertain as that we had in and
by Adam, which we lost when it was left to his own keeping. Happiness was
set before him, and propounded to him with Condition (which was renewed to the
Jews in the giving of the moral Law) do this and live. Yea God gave him (and
us in him) power to have kept that Condition, If he had would; but he gave him
not the power and grace that he should infallibly in very deed keep the same;
Ad^^ (as we in him) had power to stand and not fall; ye^ power was never
granted to him or any (by virtue of the first Covenant) to rise again, Bernard.
if he or they did fall. But God now gives more grace, and works in us the
Conditions of his new Covenant, which consists chiefly (not in Commandments,
but in his most gracious and free promises*

Secondly, 2 God should be no more effectual in good t^^n Satan in evil.
if Gods gra^^ and the efficacy of it reach no further then to moral^ swasion,
(outwardly and inwardly) what does God more toward the Conversion then the
devil to wards subversion of asinner?

Thirdly, 3 Man's goodness should be more ascribed to him self then to God.
in the Conversion of a sinner, more should be ascribed to nature the^ to
grace; to man's will then to God; because God (by common grace) only moves, but
man obeyes; Now no man is good in that barely, he is moved to his duty and
admonished, but in that he obeyes the admonition, motive, or persuasion. And
thus should man be good and do good; (be Converted, have Faith, and continue
in weldoing) especially because he so wills, not because God made him good, or
gave ^im Faith and Repentance, etc. but only because God ^dmonished him that
he hold be good, and called upon him by precepts, ex^ortations, and promises,
to believe and to be holy.

Lastly, hence also it would follow, that the difference between the go^^ and
the bad, The difference between the good and bad should be made by man himself
and by nature.
between the Children of God and (...) this World, as suppose between Peter
and Iud^^ should be wholly made fr^^ nature, not from gract^ because to use
grace arig^^ (that is, to yield consent and to will our own Co^version) is
from man's (...) will, and that is from mture; and so grace shou^ confer, and
afford (...) more to Peter, who converts then to Judas, who remain^
unconverted; which is contrary to that of the Apost^^ saying, and asking: W^^
distinguishes thee, or mak^^ thee differ from another And, what have thou that
the did not receive? 1 Cor. 47.
Now (...) thou did receive it, why do^ thou glory as if thou had n^
received i^?

This Text cutts the broat of free will, And the co^^erted should have just
cause to glory even in Gods sight
and o ^erthrowes the error of ^niversall or common grace. ^or so might Peter
boast and glory, and that justly with God; for if God by ^is common grace give
on^y a possibility to will our own Conversion or not, and man's will afford the
^ct, or to be willing to con^ert, then grace grants no ^ore to Peter then to
Judas; and therefore Peter diffe ^enceth him self from Judas, (...) as all
true Converts from others) by something of his own, and proper to himself;
for they differ not ^eally by any grace of God, which they before hand have
^eceived, wherewith they might freely work and to operate with Gods grace, or
not. For both receive the same grace in common, and a power to will their own
Conversion, So as that they may also nill it; This grace being thus far
common, puts no difference between them. What does it then? Peter wills what
Judas wills not: He will make use of that common help afforded of God, and
that out of his own Liberty of will and power of nature, Judas (having the
same Liberty and power) will not; Dr. Ward in Conciore de gratia discriminante.
So that the difference between them is in the last place brought to that free
Cooperation and working, which each of them has from his natural power and
inbred Liberty of will; So that it will invincibly follow that Peter may glory
in Gods sight after this manner, as even a Popish Writer (handling this
argument against the Jesuits) brings him in thus speaking: Lord I give thee
thanks that thou have in mercy conferred unto me supernatural help; namely,
to be able to will mine own Conversion; Bannez. in 2. q. 10. art. 1. document
30.
but yet thou have afforded the like and equal help unto Judas, my fellow
Disciple; Howbeit J have added to that thou have given me, that which by the
supernatural power thou did not give me; namely, the will (actually) to
convert; and where as I received no more then he, yet I have done and wrought
more the^ he, in as much as I now be come justified, and he remains in his
sins; Therefore I owe no more to thee and to thy grace then this Judas who is
not Converted.

Now, Sic Augusti^. d^ praedestinat. Sanctor. c. 5.
says this Author, and so say I, Christian E^^^ abhor to hear this boasting;
For it were pride is the highest so to think, and extreme blasphemy so to
speak. Hence we conclude, that Peter, and so all true Converts, do receive
from God, not only a power to convert if they will, but the very good will it
self, whereby they consent and accept of grace offered; yea they receive not
only common grace, but that grace which eminently does difference them from
others, and that grace is from Gods predestination.

SECT. 21.
^F now we further take a view, It is further showed whence man's conversion is.
It is from Gods special grace, who removes the aforesaid impediments. 2 T^^^.
2.25. As
and ask whence ^is power of thinking, con^iving, Willing, speaking,
be^^nning, doing, and perfecting good work is (for such ^ings are done as we
see ^he Faith full, and in such ^ive and dye in the Faith (...) fear of God)
the an^er is readily given; It is not from our selves so) ^m God and his
effectual ^ee; for he it is that re^oves the first. Obstacle spoken of) which
is our ^^turall Ignorance, by re^^ling his will effectually those that are hi^,
giving ^em Repentance, to the ac^^owledgement of the Truth. Which effect,
though to the Ministers and Teachers of the Truth (who know not beforehand the
effec^ of their ministry in regard especially of particular persons) it go
with a peradventure, Our ignorance.
yet in regard (...) God, and of those who^ God has given unto Christ it is
without all peradventure; and given according to Gods good pleasure, with
special choice (...) some, not al, and that by the free gift and gracious
working of Christ, according to that of Christ him self I thank thee O Father
because thou have hi^ these things from the wi^^ and prudent, Mat. 11.25, 26,
27.
and have revealed them unto Babe^ Even so Father, for so (...) seemed good in
thy sight (...) All things are delivere^ to me of my Father; And no man knows
the Son but the Father; Neither knows any man the Father save the Son, and
he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him. See John 6.45.

The second impediment which was our natural un^eliefe, Our unbelief. Ephesians.
2.13.
making us fly from God) he removes by giving is Son Christ, and offering
^imselfe propitious to us in ^im, there by holding out ^e Golden Scepter; yea
^aking us (who sometimes ^ere far off) nigh by the ^oud of Christ.

But thirdly and chiefly, Our natural inability.
^e takes away that natural ^ability which is in us, by ^abling and giving not
^ely power to Repent, Be^ve, and do good, and to persevere therein, but the
very act of al these, (as is often noted) Is. 26.12. Phi. 2.1^. So that now
Paul, who looking to his own strength, could say for himself and others, We
are not sufficient of our selves, to think any thing as of our selves; yet
else where can say, 2 Cor. 3.5. Phil. 4.13.
I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me^ and our
sufficiency is of G^^* Which w^rk^ of God is diverly called in Scripture.


Now this sufficient grace of God is his efficient or effectual grace, as is
proved. In which regard the work of Gods grace and spir^^ in Scripture is
called (...) Creation, Psalm. 51 12. Ephesians. ^.10. Vivification, Ephesians. 2.^
Regeneration, Ioh. 3.5. Renovation, Ephesians. 4.23. The taking a way of the sto^^
heart and giving a hea^ of Flesh. Ezekiel. 36.26. Conversion Ier. 31.18. A
Drawing. Ioh. 6.44. A pulling a man out of the Kingdom of Darkness, into the
Kingdom of Light. Col 1.13. I Peter 2.9. Acts 26.18. A working of the will and
deed. Phil. 2.13. A writing of the Law in the heart. Ier. 31.33. In a word A
raising from the dead John 5.25 Ephesians. 2.5.

SECT. 22.
THerefore all this grace and power is from God, and not from us; For, who can
make or Create himself? Or who can raise himself from death by his own power?

Objection: Yea, but we are not wholly dead, but have some free will. What may
be ascribed to man, what must be ascrided to God.
I answer: We indeed will freely what we will, but we cannot attain to will
that which is savingly good; Our will is not corrupt or dead, in regard of the
root and beginning of such actions as are within its reach and power, but in
regard of the Term or Object: So that though it has some Liberty in things
within the compass of reason, Non quoad vadicem agendi, sed ^erminum.
yet it can no more reach to its own conversion, or to do things truly and
Spiritualy good, as of it self, then the thing created to its own Creation,
or then the Child that is borne to its own begetting, or then Lazarus did to
the raising of hims;elfe from death.

This Work (especially of Conversion and Faith) as we have heard, is ascribed
to the same power which raised Christ from the dead, Ephesians. 1.19.20. And it is
said by Christ: John 6 44.
No man can come unto me, except the Father, which has sent me, draw him.
And I will raise him up at the last day. Noting that both these require the
same power, and that we are as unable to do the one, or to come to Christ, as
the other; namely, to raise our selves from the dead; As then it was Gods
power, and it only which did at first create the World by his Word, which was
operative, whereby God said: G^^. 1.3.
Let there be Light, and there was Light, etc.) So it must be, and is the same
mighty power, which by his word begets, and creates us anew^ Yea a greater
power seeme^ to be required; because i^ our Creation nothing resisted, whereas
in our reparation and new Creatie^ our wicked wills resist and with stand as
much as is them lies, so that Gods power appears in subduing and taking away
this evil disposition of our wills, making us of unwilling and rebellious,
most willing and obsequious.

The grace then afforded us, (which is as S. Angustin calls it, the grace of
God by Jesus Christ,) is not only a monitory grace whereby (whether outwardly
or inwardly) he would by his suasions incline us (for this is not enough,
unless God first create in us spiritual Life, whereby we may hear and yield
to his mo^ives: For where there is no Life, swasions can take no place, no more
then if Cicero with his eloquence should seek to move the affectipns of a dead
man;) neither ^s it a common universal grace, assisting all and each ^like;
but it is such a grace ^s gives to the Soul a spiritual and divine being,
which is to the Soul as health to the body, (yea more,) and which has man's
Liberty under the power of it, ^
so as to make use of it, and to rule in man's will as it pleases, without
offering any violence thereunto, and without prejudicing the Liberty of it, or
its free manner of working, In a word, this grace is (...) which first works
thi^ good will, and then works by it. It is that in ward moving, and
effectual grace, which is both praevenie^^ qua velimus, and subsequens
^^srustra velimus; That is, it both prevents us whereby we will, and it
follows (...) (and accompanies us continually) that we will no^ in vain;
(or that we fall no^ a way from our steadfastness;) What our Churches Dectrine
is herein.
This is also the Doctrine of our Church in the tenth Article, which te^^ us,
we cannot turn and prepare our selves by ou^ natural strength and good
works to Faith and calling upon God, and that we have no power to do good
works pleasant and acceptable to God, without the grace of God preventing (...)
that we may have a good will, land working in us, when we have that good Will.

SECT. 23.
This Doctrine (being the very plain and evident ^uth of God, Use hereof.
as we have ^eene) both lets us see what ^ur duty is toward him, ^also what
is the immuta^lity of his counsel and ^ood purpose to us.

1. Hence we learn to give all glory to God, and not to (...) selves.
We are hence taught (...) give all glory unto God, ^d not to glory in our
^lves; and for ever to re^ember that of the Apostle, ^at we learn not to think
of others or of our selves) love that which is written, ^
^at no one of you (says ^ee) be puffed up for ont against another, (much
les^then against God himself for who makes thee t^ differ from another, and
what have thou that thou (...) not received; Now if the did received it, why
do (...) glory, as if thou had not received it? Let God th^^ have all the
glory of tha^ grace and goodness whereby thou differest from ^^nother; for it
is he wh^ has predestined us, un^ the adoption of Children by Jesus Christ,
to himself according to the good pl^^ sure of his will; Ephesians. 1.5.
To the Pra^ of the glory of his grace, (...) But in such case, let us w^ the
Psalmist in another ca^^ say, Ps. 115.1.
and that from the hear^ Not unto us O Lord, not (...) us, but to thy name g^^
glory.

Thus to do is truly Christian; Thus to do is Christian.
For God has so (according to his eternal Counsel) disposed of all things
here below, 1 Cor. 1.29. I^r. 9.24. Romans 3*27. Romans 4.2.
that no fle^^s should glory in his presence. Let him then that glories, glory
in this, says the Lord, that he understands and knows me that I am the
Lord that exercises loving kindness, etc. The Law or Faith excludes all
boasting in our selves: otherwise if we will bring ought of our own, we may
rejoice and glory, but not before God. To glory in our selves is heathen^th.
Bet us then leave all glorying to the profane Heathen, who indeed, wholly
ignorant of Gods grace, have avouched, that we truly and justly may glory of
our virtue; Which say they we would never do if it were the gift of God, and
not a thing of our own; And says another, it is one principal step to
happiness, for a man to admire himself, that is, to doat upon his own
excellency.

Let us then give glory to God, Ci^^ro de not. Deoru, lib. 3. Seneca de vita
Beata, c. 8. Popish.
and depend wholly upon him, and on his grace. Papists (not to say others) will
be as little beholding to Gods grace as may be, where they imagine their own
will and natural strength to be sufficient, there they think not the gift of
special grace to be so necessary: they think it need full to make us to do
good duties, Bellarm^de gratia, etc. ^ib. 5. c. 7.
more easily and readily; So that to overcome tentations, that no sin be
committed, they do not always require Gods special help, that is internal
illumination, and supernatural motion, but any help whatsoever; But what
availes it to be a Christian, if this be so? The Heathen indeed think they may
come to happiness, and avoid all sin, by the good Husbanding of their own
Freewill; and therefore flatter themselves, saying, it is enough that they pray
to Jupiter, for long Life and riches; As for a good mind and virtue, they would
give that to themselves, (and so not be beholding to Jupiter f^r it,) Herat.
Ep. 18. Lib. 1.
so one flattered a great man, saying: The Gods grant thee long life, for as
for other things, thou will give them to thy self.

Now these are no Poetical flourishes, but agreeable to the Doctrine and most
serious meditations of their best Philosophers; Dit tibi de^t annos, tranquille
caetera sm^es, sint m^do virtuti tempora long a tuae Ovid. lib. 2. de ponto
Eleg. 1. a^ Germanic. Aris^ot. in Ethic. Sene^. Ep. 31. Ep. 54. Iemish.
seeing great Aristotle, the Master of morality tells us, that both virtue and
vice are in our power, or else we were neither to be praised for weldoing, nor
dispraised for ill-doing; and that every man is the forger of his own Fortune
Hence Seneca is angry with those that trouble the Gods with their prayers, that
they might be happy; saying withal, make thy self happy: Ye^ he tells u^
moreover, that in some resp^ct man has the ^d vantage of God himself, seeing
God is happy by the benefi^ of nature, but man is happy by his own good
Husbanding of his min^^ that is, God is happy, and cannot be otherwise; He is
happy of necessity, but a good man is so by his own Election and choice,
(whence by the way we see from whose forge we receive those Doctrines, which
daily do somagnifie man's power* against Gods grace, even from Philosophers and
Poets) hereun^o ad what I read concerning ^ne Barcozba a Jew, Morn. de veritate
religions Christ. c. 29.
who would make himself Christ though it were forty years after the
destruction of the ^econd Temple,) and who hav^g gathered ahu^dred thou and men
about him did so rust to their invincible ^re^gth, as that he did cut off ^e of
each of their singers; ^d going to battle he was ^o^t to say, Profane.
help us not thou lord of the World, seeing ^ou have forsaken us, etc.

Answerable to which artogancy is that of the gre^^ Turk of late, who
attempting against Polan^ presumed even without* Gods assent, that they we^^
able to destroy that Nation; for when the chie^^ Muphty, at the instance (...)
Scander Basha, General against the Polonians, appointed solemn prayers i^
their Meschites, for the good success of his Army; the Great Turk did forbi^
them; saying, that without any aid from God, the^ were able by their own^
forces to destroy the Polonians; as was intimated (...) our late Sovereign of
f^ mous and happy Memery King James by the Cou^ George Ossolniski Ambassador
of the King; of Poland, in his Oration to him.

See from these Examples what a height of pride men, who admire them ^elves,
and trust in their ^wne strength, may attain unto; Even to think themselves,
if not in whole, yet ^n part sufficient without God; every one carries an ^dol
in his heart, which is a ^ans own self, whom he ^eft to himself) would set
^p against God himself ^sse or more.

To conclude this applica^on, we see how justly S. ^ustin of old, and we now
^ay challenge the enemies ^f Gods grace, with mani^st dishonor done unto ^od,
and monstrous pride, which appears from hence; because in very deed, such ^n
neither pray aright, Such can never pray ^right.
nor give thanks unto God fe^ any good thing; For sar^ S. Austin, August. de
not. and gratia. c. 18.
what is more foolish then to pray for the which I have in mine ow^^ power? And
so may I s^ to our new Masters, what (...) that which I am to begg^^ and ask
of God? Is it su^ cient grace? Nay they w^^ tell me, I enjoy that already, by
Covenant (in Ba^tisine, D. Pride. lect. 4.
in which is given (...) each sufficient grace to ser^ God if they will) and
this have with such Hypocrit^ as never beg it. Is it the the good use of that
grace^ But this I can draw into A^ by mine own endeavou^ out of the inbred
indi^^ rencie of mine own free^ will. Nor be truly thankef^ll
Now who I pray y^^ can seriously beg that ^ another, which he has (...)
possesses already? yea or ^ew can any be truly tha^k^ll for that which he
has ^ot so much received as gi^en and himself afforded? ^ow can we glorify
God ^y offering him praise when ^ee aseribe (though but in ^art and in the
second ^lace) the praise and power ^f weldoing to our selves? ^et them see to
it who will ^ave Gods grace in man's Conversion to be common, ^niversall and
such as they also partake as truly of, yea and as effectually, who re^maine
unconverted.

SECT. 24.
SEcondly, the aforesaid Doctrine lets us see the immutability of Gods good
purpose, Use 2, To comfort us from the immutability of Gods purpose and
promises.
manifested by his promises toward those that are his; And so (to our
unspeakable comfort) arms us against all doubt and conceits of our own
unworthiness, inability, frailty, and readiness to fall from his grace, for
a^ the freeness of his promises and grace prevents our pride, so the firmness
of his purpose, and most certain, powerful, and independent performance of
his promises should preve^ our fears. For Gods purpose according to Election,
does and will stand, not of our works (or of any thing or power in man) but of
him that calls. Romans 9.11.
Though then Gods promises of Life and Salvation do in Scripture run with
Condition, and ^o are made generally to all ^ at least to all in the (Church,)
that none may ^ave just cause to complain ^r blame God, but themselves if they
attain not to ^ife; Yet the performance of the Condition, On which and not on
our selves, his grace and our salvation depends.
and consequently the thing promised are made (in regard of ^he Elect) to
depend upon Gods most free grace and power, and so the effects of Gods grace
and love are in ^u^ but the free grace, favor and love it self, together with
the power working these, are in God, and therefore are immutable, and
consequently our happy estate, and our Salvation (which depends not on our
selves, but on these) is infinitely more safe, being thus in God, then it could
be in us our Justification, Faith, Sanctification and Perseverance, and so our
Salvation should be most mutable, if they de pe^ded on our selves, (so that
we may give such men leave to hold a falling a way from grace, who make it to
depend on themselves, on their own acceptance or rejection,) but blessed be
God who has undertaken for these also, and will accordingly as he has most
absolutely promised, so effectually work in us, whatsoever he has promised.

If any should a^ke concerning the World, why it continues so long? Why the
Sun does cons^antly rise and set, and why night and day, with the Seasons of
the year do so consta^tly succeed one another? The answer is, that the
wis^ome, power, and providence, by which the World ^ governed, is not in the
^reatures themselves, nei^eer depends on them, ei^^er Angels or Men, but on ^e
most immutable God, ^se all things would soon ^ll into confusion and ruin;
^en so is it in this business ^ere of man's Salvation (so ^ten mentioned) Happy
^en are we, and most safe, ^ in matters of this nature ^ee (not neglecting the
^eanes) do ascribe nothing (...) our selves but all to ^od. Tutiores v^vimus si
totum Deo damus, etc. August.
It is most dangerous (...) ascribe too little to the ^ace of God; (said a wise
^d Learned Prelat;) for ^en we rob him of ^^is ^^ry. But if we ascribe too
^le to our selves, there i^ no danger; To ascribe all to God the safest.
for whatsoever we take from our selves, it cannot hinder us from being true
Christians; But if we ascribe that to the strength of our own nature, which
is the proper work of grace, then do we blemish Gods glory.

SECT. 25.
THere remains yet one maine question, To what end then are Gods precepts S^
exhortations?
and doubt to be resolved, and so we will conclude: (...) things be thus, why
the^ does God command an^ exhort us to that which ^ not in our power to per^
form? This question is ne^ needless, seeing from suc^ exhortations and
command in Scripture: 1 Common Christians do gather ^^^^^bility in us to keep
all Gods commandments. 2. The needfulnesse of this question.
The Lutherans and others would conclude universal grace, and the like
possibility, to do or not to do the things commanded and exhorted ^unto,
seeing such comma^ds and exhortations are made to all, (especially in the
Church,) in common to good and bad. 3 Both they in part, and chiefly Papists
would hence establish (besides the other) freedom of will, which we hitherto
have overthrown.

I answer then in particu^ar to the doubt propounded: The answer. 1 Our
strength now is not to be measured by Gods commandments.
Three things; first ^wee must not measure our strength by Gods comma^dnents,
so much we may and must learn out of Scripture; God commands us to love him,
saying: Thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy
soul, Mat. 22.37.
and with all thy mind. So also we may read in Deuteronomy. Deuteronomy. 30.6.
6.5. Yet the same Lord tells us also, that he himself must first Circumcise
our hearts to love him Saying by Moses: The Lord thy God will circumcise thine
heart, and the heart of thy Seed, to love the Lord thy Ge^ with all thine heart
and wif^ all thy seule, that thou ma^^ live. And to the like effect are all
those places named concerning Faith, remiss^^ of sin, Repentance, new
ob^dience, Perseverance, yea^ humility; all which God requires at our hands,
yea and exhorts us unto; yet as we^ have seen, See Sect. 9, 10, 11, 12 13, 14.
we work no^ these, but God by his effectual grace, and according to his
promise, works them in us. So to specify ^it, and to show it in some of
these more expressy, Christ says: Come unto me all ye that labor; yet the
same mouth says: Mat. 11.28.
No man ^an come unto me, John 6.44.
except the Father which has sent me draw him. So God bids us ^urne: Turn ye
even unto me ^ith all your heart etc. Joel 2.12.
Yet ^aith Ephraim: Ier. 31.18.
Turn thou ^e, and I shall be turned. And ^he Church, Lament. 5.21. ^urne
thou us unto thee O lord, and we shall be turned; and in very deed we cannot
suspirare, sigh for sin, ^nlesse God do first in pi^are, inspire and breathe
it ^, Romans 8.26. God must ^ause his wind to blow, and breath into us the
Spirit of Life) before these waters (of repe^tant tears) do flow. Psalm. 147.18
So again: Learn to do well. Isa. 1.17. and Ia. 2.12. So do as they, etc.
And here: Happy are ye if y^ do them. And yet says our Savior Christ:
Without me ye can do nothing. John 15.6.
And so for knowledge David speaks thus: 1 Chrs. 28.9
And thou Solomon my Son, know thou the God of thy Father etc. And here: If we
know these things, etc. ^^at. 11.27
And yet says Christ: No man knows the Father save the son, and he to
whenever the Son will reveal^ him. And John 6.46.

SECT. 26.
SEcondly, Gods precepts and exhortations are grounded on his promise.
such Exhortations and Precepts have their foundation and ground, not on our
natural power, but on Gods promises, as is said, 1 These. 5.23, 24.
and on the new Covenant. So, the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I
pray God, your whole spirit and soul and body, be preserved blameless unto
the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ; then it follows: Faithful is he that
calls you, who will also do it. Phil. 2.12. 13.
So work out your own Salvation with fear and trembling; For it is God which
works in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure. So, Wash ye, make
ye clean, Isa. 1.16. Ezekiel. 36.2^
says God by his Prophet Isa. But by his Prophet Ezekiel: I will sprinkle
Water upon you, and ye shall be clean; and I will cleanse you. So, walk
before me, Genesis 17.1. Ezekiel 36.27 Romans 6.12.14.
an be thou perfect. And, I wild cause you to walk in my statutes. Lastly,
Let not sin reign in your mortal bodies. And, Romans 6.12.14.
sin shall not reign or have Dominion over you, etc. Romans 6.12.14.

SECT. 27.
THirdly, These exhortations are not yet in vain. 1. Not in regard of the
reprobate, who thus are told what they should have done. Luke 12.47.
and lastly: I^ say, that yet such Exhortations and Commandments are not in
vain, but serve for very good ends, and that both in regard of the reprobate
and Elect.

1 The reprobate, are hence put in mind what they should do, or should have
done, and what once they had power to have done.

Secondly thus they are left without excuse, They are thus convinced as was
Pharach. Exodus 8.1.
as knowing Gods will, but not doing it; and Gods justice is thus made more
manifest in their condemnation, they cannot say they now perish for want of
means, but because they are awanting to the means. Such commands then are not
in vain, though the thing commanded be not performed; for God has other ends,
(which he is not bound to make known to us) why ^he commands such things. God
sends Moses to Pharaoh, ^bidding him say unto him: Let my people go, that they
may serve me^; Which was often repeated, yet the e^ent showed that the secret
pleasure and purpose of God was, that he should not let them go: yea God also
told Moses so much saying: Exodus 11.10
Pharaoh shall not hear^en unto you, (and a reason ^s given,) that my wonders
may be multiplied in the Land of Egypt. (And see Romans 9.17. and Exodus 9.16.
(And then it is added: and the Lord hardened Pharaohs heart, so that he would
not let the Children of Israel go out of his Land.

Now though Pharaoh (as others his like now) stood bound to obey this
Commandment, And the Commandment in regard to God is not in vain.
yet Gods chief aim herein was not Ph^raohs obedience, but to convince him of
Rebellion and hardness of heart; and so according to Gods intention it was
properly a Commandment of Conviction, so I may say as sound Divines have said
before me (...) Gods Word in the ministry of it, where the command is given to
all to Repent and believe, is not to delud^ men, though effectual grace be not
given to all so to do; That Commandment, though it should of all in duty be
obeyed, and though in the intent of the Minister (who is to preach Faith and
Repentance, 2 Timothy 2.25
and to call them thereunto, even those that oppose themselves) it have only
one end; namely, the Salvation of those he preaches unto, yet (as the event
makes it plain, by which God declares at length what his purpose was) in the
intention and counsel of God it has diverse ends; in them that are ordained
^o eternal Life it is a precept of obedience, because God will fully enable
them to do that which he commands: In the rest, it is a Commandment of
trial or conviction; that to unbelievers, their sin might be discovered, and
all excuse cut off. Thus when the precept is given to believe, but not the
grace of Faith, God does not delude, but reprove and convince men of unbelief,
and that in his justice, because when they believe not, they sin against
grace offered them, and in some measure given them. So that from such
Exhortations made in common to all, we may not conclude, that God has the
same and alike good mind and intent infallibly to save all.

Object. Yet God is not unjust in so doing.
Though God thus should attain his end, and so in regard of him the
Commandment should not be in vain; Yet should not this savor of great
injustice and cruelty, to require a thing impossible to man left to himself?

I answer, True, Why? 1. 2. 3. 4.
if God had not given man power and a possibility. 2. If Man had not willingly
disabled himself, and drawn it upon himself, by his own fault. 3. If man
should now by grace ask (as he should) this ability to obey God, and to
acknowledge his own impotency, and bewail it. Yea 4. If God were bound to
give it without asking; for man was at first made according to the Image of
God, and had power sufficient given him, to have done whatsoever God should at
any time have required of him. So that if man through his own default has lost
this power to obey God, yet God has not lost his right to require his
Obedience, which he may justly do, though he know man unable to discharge it.
He may require it of a proud sinner to convince him, and to leave him without
excuse, as a man may require, and call for a debt of a great value, which the
debtor (falling into decay through his own ryotousnes and carelessenes) cannot
now repay, especially if the debtour carry himself insolently and malepartly
against the Creditour (as such men do against God,) who may thus stop his
mouth, and put him to silence, yea to shame. But seeing they, in a sense of
their own inability, do not ask this grace and power from God, God is not
bound to give it unto them. But fifthly the truth is, man in the Gospel is not
left wholly to himself: God both offers and gives more grace then he answers*
so that if man repent and believe not when God calls him to it, he sins
against grace offered him, and against the Gospel through his own default
(whether contempt or negligence) and so incurres greater condemnation then such
as have not the same helps means and grace offered them. 3. 3 They are thus
restrained, and the godly live more peaceably by them.
These Exhortations and precepts (unto which are annexed curses and punishments
upon disobedience) are howsoever to restrain their natural corruption (as in
Herod) which else would break out unto all outrage; So that there would be no
living for the godly in the world if the fear of punishments upon their
disobedience did not restrain the wick^^d Or howsoever, God 4. (in his
justice) may do this for the increase of their sin, their further hardening
(after they have once hardened themselves against his grace) and just
Condemnation, as Isa 6.9.10. Hear ye. but understand not; and make the heart
of this people fat.

SECT. 28.
SEcondly, Such precepts are not in vain, in regard of the elect. 1.
Unconverted, who thus: 1. Are taught to deny themselves, and fiye to Christ.
the Elect may be considered first as unconverted; And first then, such
Exhortations and Commands are not in vain; ^inasmuch, 1. As they prove to be
the means of their Conversion; whilst seeing* ^hereby, and finding (upon
^riall) their own impotency ^o do the thing required, and consequently their
mi^ery if the things be not done, they are forced to fly ^ut of themselves, to
seek ^elpe where help may be ^ad, and that is from Christ (...) who is also
preached and ^ffered to such as thus ^roaning under their own ^urthen seek
and come to ^im for ease, Mat. 11.28. ^ome unto me all ye that la^ur and are
heavy laden, etc.) thus the very Law is ^id to be our Schoolema^er to Christ,
Gal. 3.24.
seeing it ^oves a preparation to Conversion, by accident, yet by Gods singular
providence toward his electones, who in a manner are forced to acknowledge
their own unrighteousness and impotency, to despair of themselves, and to
seek righteousness and life i^ Christ the redeemer by Faith, Gal. 3.21. and
22.
according to that: (...) there had been a Law give^ which could have given
life ver^y, righteousness sho^^ have been by the Law. But to Scripture has
concluded (...) under finne, that the prom^^ by Faith of Jesus Christ mi^^ be
given to them that believ^^

This then teaches the^ what especially to beg (...) Gods hand, And to seek
help where it only may be had.
namely, there newing of their nature b^ his power; Yea and stirre^ them up to
beg the same to pray for grace, and to use all good means besides, as the Word
and Sacraments whereby they might attain to saving and effectual grace.

Thus God bids his people turn unto him, saying: Ezck. 33.11.
Turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways, for why will ye dye Oh house of
Israel? And they pray to him now (sensible of their own inability) saying:
Lam. 5.21
Turn thou us ^ob Lord, and we shall be turned. Let us run, Heb. 12.1. 1 Cor.
9.24.
says the Apostle, with patience the ^ace that is set before us: And, so run
that ye may obtain; Now the affection of Gods people is expressed in that of
David: Ps. 119.32.
I will run the way of thy Commandments when thou shall enlarge my ^eart;
And by that of the Church: Cant. 1.4.
Draw me, and we will run after thee.

Thus again David speaking to God: Psalm. 119.4.5.
Thou have commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently. (It seems then it is
in our power so to do; No, therefore he knowing his own impotency, flies to
God, by prayer, saying:) O that my ways were directed to keep thy statuter;
And, thus the Imperative in Scripture does not beget the Potentiall, but only
the optative.

Hence, Da Domine quod jubes, and jube quod vis, and non frustra subebis. Au.
de bono persever. ca 20.
S. Austin: Lord give me power to do wh^ thou command, then conmand and
require of me wh^^ thou please, and thou sh^^ not require it in vain. And
accordingly it may be noted, that there is not any thing required of us in all
Gods Commandments, ^oth Legal and Evangeli^all, but for the effect of it, ^ve
are directed, enjoined, and called upon to seek ^he same of God by prayer, ^n
some or other of the pe^tions of the Lords Prayer; ^s might be at large
decla^ed, and as I elsewhere have ^hewed; So that if God ^quire our obedience,
as every where he does both for matter and manner, say ^ng, So speak ye,
Iam. 2 12.
and so do ^ee, etc. And here: Happy are ye if ye do them. This should but
stir us up to pray, as in the Lords prayer: Thy will be done in Earth as it
is in Heaven; Psa. 143.10
and as David prays, Teach me to do ^hy will, for thou art my God We may
then very truly say, that for God thus to require of us things to us
impossible, is a very great Benefit, because it is the way for us to attain to
a possibility and power to do what he commands.

SECT. 29.
ANd this now is secondly to be considered, 2 Are indeed converted.
tha^ by such Exhortations and Commands the Elect are indeed converted. Seeing
these are Sanctified of God as means to this end, Such precepts and
exhortations being sanctified of God as means of convertion. Heb. 4 12L
and as instruments by which the Holy ghost renewes the will, and does convert
it^ for by the means of such his precepts and Exhortations the Holy Ghost
uset^ to show forth its power i^ the Conversion of sinners With his
Commandment and Exhortations God ^oucheth the heart, and opens it, to
attend, to re^eive the Word, and to ^bey it, as in those converts, Acts 2.37.
and in Lydia, Acts 16.14. Yea with his Word (which is operative) he gives
grace, strength, and power, Acts 3.6.7. and 12.16.
and himself performs that which he requires. As when Peter said to the lame
man: Rise up and walk; Immediately his feet and ancle ^ones received strength,
and be leaped up stood and walked, etc. But by whose power? His own? Nay, not
by the power of Peter, much less by his own power; But only by the name and
power of Jesus, who wrought with Peter's word. Thus Christ cried to Lazarus, who
had been dead four days, saying, Lazarus come forth, But what power had dead
Lazarus so to do? Yet Lazarus, even he that was dead, came forth, etc. He
arose from the dead (as we shall all do hereafter) but not by his own power,
but Christ's Yet the rising is ascribed unto him, though the power by which he
arose was only Christ's. So we are taught to preach and speak even to such as
are dead in sin, and to say to them: Awake thou that sleep, Ephesians. 5.14.
and arise from the dead. And yet though they be dead, our exhortation is not
in vain, where it pleases God to make it effectual (whose Spirit as the
wind, blows and, works where it will, in every one that is borne of God,
Joh. 3.8.) and Christ gives unto them Light and Life.

This at once shows that ^uch precepts and exhorta^ons do neither imply any
^ower in us, now as of our ^lves, to Convert, Repent, ^d to Believe, and do
well, though we are said to ^onvert, Repent, and Be^ve) neither are they in
^ine, seeing though God ^quire, that which is im^ssible to us, yet he gives
(...) power to us to do that ^ich he requires; namely, Repent and Believe, and
^obey; this he does in (...) here, and will fully ^ish and perfect in his ^od
time hereafter.

SECTION. 30.
BUt now, Converted, who are put in mind to stir up grace in them. 2 Timothy 1.6.
lastly, let u^ consider the Elect a^ thus already converted, and then such
precepts and admonitions are not in vain For 1. now having receive^ a new
Life, they are the put in mind to stir (...) (as one would do fire) God
grace in them; which with out such Exhortations, (...) a weak fire under gree^
wood would soon decay And to work out the Salvation with fear a^ trembling,
that is, w^ much humility, and w^ as little selfe-confidence.

2 They are thus ad^nished to seek after pe^ction, To seek after perfection,
and to be thankful.
to seek to Christ (...) for their preservation (...) ^erseverance; And to
consi^er what Christ has done ^or them, that so they ^ight be more thankful
and careful, by all holy and ^ood endeavors, to do and perform what God on
^eir parts does and may ^astly require by way of re^itall at their hands.

Such Exhortations then (...) them do help to keep (...) this Heavenly fire;
For ^od preserves the^ by such ^eanes, who otherwise of ^emselves are ready to
de^rt from, yea and to fall ^om grace received.

Therefore is that Caveat, ^e heed Brethren, Heb. 3.12.13.
least there (...) any of you an evil heart (...) belief, in departing from
(...) God; But exhort (...) the^ daily, while it is ^ed to day, least any of
you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. 2 Cor. 6.1.
Thus also does Paul and Timothy exhort the Corinthians, saying: We beseech
you, that ye^ receive not the grace of God i^ vain. Such exhortation^ are not
to insinuate tha^ men may or shall at lea^ fall from the grace of pra^
destination, or from th^^ grace of Gods effectua^ calling, which proceed from
God, and comes to (...) by way of Gods eternal purpose; for this is mo^
constant and unchangabl^ Romans 11.29. But least the fall away, God preser^ them
by such exhortati^^ (his own and others) as (...) the means of their safe^

And God may justly (...) quire of those whom (...) has once effectually call^
and quickened by grace, the ^ight use and employment of such talents as they
have ^eceived. Yea it would ^ow be greater shame to them, if being made
strong, and furnished with Spiritu^ll Weapons, they should ^ot resist Satan,
sin, and ^mptation, but suffer the ^heefe to rob, and spoil ^em of their
graces.

SECT. 31:
TO conclude all; These exhortations expel security, though Gods grace work
all.
these Exhortations and com^ands, though they be not (...) our own power to
do ^d keep accordingly, yet ^e see they are not in vain ^^t have their
special use any ways, yea we are by (...) means to neglect them, ^lesse we
will neglect our own Salvation. Though the power be Gods, yet the duty is
ours; And God promising his power, require yet of us our endeavors* Therefore
says he, Labo^ or work not for the meat the perishes, John 6.27.
but for that which endures to everlasting Life which the Son of Man sh^^
give unto you. Though the Son will give it us, ye^ not without our labor so
work cut your Salvation For it is God that works? Philia. 12.13.
you, etc. Though it be God that works, yea an^ will work in us, yet we must
not neglect to work^

As we Ministers the^ must labor and still cast (...) our Nets, Ministers
must exhort.
yea be patie^ though of a long time we catch nothing, in meekn^ instructing
those that oppose themselves, (expecting if God peradventure will give them
repentance, to the acknowledging of the Truth; 2 Timothy 2.25
and must rest assured, that we bring glory to God even in those that perish,
and that the peace which we preach in and by the Gospel, (whereof they judge
themselves unworthy,) shall return to us a gain, and our work still be with
the Lord.

So all generally are hence taught to depend on the public ministry, And the
people must depend on the public ministry.
and on the Word of Exhortation, seeing God compels us not, but gently draws
us; and neither to expect that God by Enthusiasme and immediate revelation
without the word should inspire us, or yet so far to presume on Gods decree
of praedestination of us (either the one way or the other) as either to expect
and hope to attain eternal Life, (being the end) without a care^^ll,
conscionable, and constant use of the Means, or yet to despair of attaining
unto Life, if we with any good conscience do use the Means.

SECT. 32.
THe consideration o^ our Election, The certainty of Gods election and of Gods
grace, should whet our diligence to all good duties.
whether we have the knowledge o^ it or no, and the certain and infallible
performance of all Gods promises (which we have so fully proved) should whet
our diligence in all good duties, teaching us to labor earnestly for Faith and
all other saving graces, which as they are the means of our Salvation, so are
they the evidence of our Election; As we are chosen to Salvation (and to
attain it) through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the Truth; So
are we to give all diligence to make our calling and Election sure; 2 These.
2.13 2 Pet. 1.10.
For, says S. Peter, if ye do these things, ye shall never fall. As Faith
and Repentance, and like graces are blessings, in regard of God, and so do
befall the Elect, most certainly; whereof also he gives them assurance, by
his most free and absolute promises, Ephesians. 1.3.
and by his Covenant of Grace: So are they (most of them at least) duties, in
regard of us, being required of all (living especially in the Church) and such
as from which none may exempt themselves.

Though then we should know our selves to be elected to life, Such as know
their election, must not neglect the means.
yet we are by no means to neglect the means of Life; as hearing of the word
Faith, Repentance, prayer, perseverance, etc. Seeing God has as well
foreordained us to the means as to the end, to these as well as to life; yea
to life by these means; so that if any will neglect the means, let him never
look to attain the end. So that I avow it, and say, that if it were possible
that the Elect should not be sanctified, should not believe, or not use the
means (being called to the use of them) upon that supposall they should never
attain to life, but perish eternally; So Paul concluded in a like case; He
was assured of safety for himself, and those that sailed with him; yet said he
most truly, except these (the mariners) abide in the ship, and so use the
means of safety appointed of God ye cannot be saved. Hebr. 12.14
See Acts 27.22.24.25. with verses 30.31. Luke 13.3.
Therefore say I to such: Follow peace and holiness, without which no man
shall see the Lord. And, John 8.24.
except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish. And if ye believe not, says
Christ, that I am he, ye shall dye in your sins, John 3.36.
and he that believes not the Son shall not see Life.

On the other hand, Much Iess^ should such as know it not a^ yet.
let not the wickedest that truly repent and believe, despair of Life; Let
them do well, and they most undoubtedly shall have well; God himself could say
to Cain, whom yet he knew to be a reprobate: Genesis 4.7.
if thou do well, shall thou not be accepted? And I as truly may say to all
(one and other) as our Savior in my Text: If ye know these things, happy are
ye if ye do them. Exclude not thou thy self, and Gods Word will not exclude
thee; do thou thy duty, and attend to the Word; (as for Gods secret coun^^ll
meddle not with it, nei^^er search into it, and I am sure God has not revealed
to any in particular aforeha^d, that they are reprobates) and fly to God,
though he seem an enemy unto thee; at least put it to this adventure, and say
to God as the Lepers reasoned concerning the Syrians: if he kill us, we shall
but dye; See 2 Kings 7.3.4. And with the Ninivites, saying when they heard a
terrible threatening absolutely (for the form of it) denounced: Iona 3.9.
who knows if God will return and repent, etc. Repent thou, and put it to
the trial (otherwise thou shall most undoubtedly perish) and thou shall find
unexpected success. Oh that we durst or would but take trial of Gods Truth,
and promised mercies. Oh that God would make this exhortation (working
po^erfully by it) effectual to ^he calling home of his own.

But howsoever let us all know that we must expect an end answerable to our
doings. All must expect an end answerable to their doings.
If then, says Paul, ye live after the flesh, ye shall dye; but if through
the Spirit ye do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live; Be not
deceived, God is not mocked; For whatsoever a man sows that shall he also
reap; Romans 8.13.
For he that sows to the flesh, Gal. 6.7, 8.
shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that sows to the Spirit, shall
of the Spirit reap Life everlasting. Cease then to do evil, learn to do
well; If ye be willing and obedient, Isa. 1.16, 17, 19.20.
ye shall eat the good of the Land; But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be
devoured with the Sword; for the month of the Lord has spoken it. Know it then
for a certainty, that God will render to every man according to his deeds, to
them who by patient continuance in weldoing seek for glory, honor, Romans 2.6,
7, 8, 9, 10.
and immortality, eternal Life; But to them that are contentious and do not
obey the Truth, but obey unrighteousness, Indignation and Wrath, Tribulation
and anguish upon every soul of man that does evil; But glory, honor and
peace to every man that works good. And so I conclude, saying with my Text:
If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.

A COROLLARIE.

SECT. 33.
WHereas Truth is ever consonant to it self, A general inference from the
foregoing discourse.
and that there is no real and true contradiction in the Scriptures, but a
sweet Harmony and Analogy, proportion, and correspondence, between and among
all the parts thereof; and seeing the Scriptures are so evident and exceeding
plain, pregnant and full. For the proof of the powerful determining, and
most effectual operation of Gods grace, and of the most certain performance
of Gods conditional promises, by his undoubted working and effecting of the
required Conditions themselves, according to his most abs^lute and free
promises, and his new Covenant made in Christ, as now has been showed; we may
from such pregnant proofs and evidence of Scripture co^ceive of the truth of
such other points and articles, Teaching us how to conceive of other
controverted points.
as have either dependence on, or reference unto the aforesaid evident doctrine,
which (some of them especially) perhaps are not so clear unto us, partly
through the doubtfullnesse and seeming obscurity of some texts of Scripture;
partly and especially by reason of the blindness, and yet self wisdom of
man's corrupt reason, who is ready to conceive of God only, according to his
own fancy, or at least not willing to entertain any thought of God, but such
as he can well in reason conceive of.

Now these other points are especially the Doctrine of predestination, As of
predestination, the end of Christ's death, certainty of salvation and
perseverance.
namely of election and reprobation, the efficacy, intention, and end of
Christ's death, the certainty of Salvation, both in it self and to us, with the
perseverance of the Saints in grace, without falling away from it, either
finally or totally, with other lesser, yet like points which our Church of
England and other Reformed Churches do hold and maintain against Pelagians*
Papists, Semipelagians, Remonstrants, or Arminians, and Socinians.

SECT. 34.
ITs true, all other points do chiefly depend up on the Doctrine or Gods
predestination; All other points are framed, according to the dostrine of Gods
predestination.
and as it is conceived of by either party, so and accordingly all other heads
of Doctrine are framed. But whereas our Adversaries charge us with an
unwillingnesse in handling that Controversy, they do it very falsely. For our
men begin with it and prove it substantially out of holy Scriptures, to the
full Conviction (though not satisfaction) of our refractory Adversaries; And
do accordingly thence conclude against universal grace and redemption, (which
extend not themselves beyond the Decree, Collat. Hagiens. p. 489.
and are no more Conditional then the Decree it self, which Gods Word makes
absolute and independent;) So against the Apostasy of the Saints, and
uncertainty of Salvation* etc.

But yet it is as true, that there is that necessary agreement amongst all
these points of Controversy, that holding any of these latter points as we,
according to Scripture, do hold and maintain them; Predestination (as those
other points also) must be maintained just in that manner, and no otherwise
then we hold and teach it, (which yet is according to the Scriptures,) Ibid.
Though the Remonstrants make freewill their Helena, and accordingly frame other
points.
which the same our Adversaries cannot (wholly) deny.

Though to speak as the thing is, the Remonstrants, pretending to make the
Doctrine of predestination the sole and only controversy, and accordingly to
reduce and frame all other controverted points thereunto; hoping for great
advantage hereby, and presuming to make their Doctrine, especially concerning
reprobation, pass for current amongst the vulgar or most, because of the
plausiblenesse thereof; and because every common understanding cannot clear it
so easily, of the odious, though most unjust, imputations laid upon it, as,
that it makes God the Author of man's sin, unjust, cruel, and tyrannical. etc.
Yet I say in very deed, the only Helena, which they as their Friends the
Papists, do so earnestly strive and contend for, is the power of nature and
liberty, indifferency, and freedom of man's will, and natural power in works
and actions supernatural; This they do, will, and must maintain, and
accordingly they frame their predestination, and all their other Tenets,
opposing mainely the Doctrine so clearly laid down in the Scripture, and now
taught (though by me but weakly) in this present Treatise. Against this
especially they bend all their forces, (though in vain) as knowing that if
this free, powerful and determining grace of God in man's conversion
especially) be granted and suffered to stand, then of necessity the whole
Fabric of their predestination and other Tenets must all of them fall before
it, as Dagon before the Ark of God.

SECT. 35.
SEeing then that (as our Churches Doctrine is) the Church may not so expound
one place of the Scripture, Artic. 20. From the Doctrine taught of Gods free
and effectual grace we may infer,
that it be repugnant to another; And that the places brought for proof of this
one point, are so pregnant, we are therefore to conclude also,

1. That Gods eternal decree of Election is as absolute as are his promises,
That his election is not conditional, or of all, but absolute and independent.
for effecting in us what he requires of us; (on which indeed the promises
depend;) and that his election is not of al, with Condition of their works,
(as the Papists would have it) of Faith, (as the Arminians would have it,) or
of humility and meekness (as our new refiners frame it,) but of those few
only, to whom he has absolutely in his new Covenant promised, and in whom he
effectually in time works all these, both Faith, Humility, and other graces.

2. That Gods effectual grace, That grace and redemption are not universal.
and the Redemption wrought by Christ, is not (in the Arminian sense)
universal and common, equally intended for all, and that Christ by his death
has not obtained Reconciliation and remission of sin, for all and each. So
that if any place of Scripture to us see me to import otherwise; it must be
expounded (as indeed the hardest places of all may) agreeable to such most
evident Texts, as whereon the foregoing discourse is built, and must admit of
such an exposition, as is agreeable to the Analogy of Faith, and not repugnant
thereunto.

3. That, That the salvation and final perseverance of the Saints is certain.
as Gods promises of grace are most free, and absolute, and do infallibly and
necessarily take place; So also, not only the Election, but Salvation, and so
the final perseverance in grace of Gods Children, ^s most certain and
infal^ible, as not depending on man himself, but on Gods purpose, promise,
That the faithful may be assured of their salvation.
and power.

4. That consequently the Elect, after Conversion, may be assured and
ascertained by their Faith, in these absolute promises (to their unspeakable
comfort) of their Election and Salvation, and not only of their present estate
and being in grace.

THE Extent of Christ's Death and Love.
EPHESIANS. 5.2. And walk in Love, as Christ also loved us, and has given
himself for us etc.


HAving spent the greatest part of an hour in handling the Duty of Love, with
the kinds, activenesse and Constancy of it: as also the Motive thereunto,
Christ's Love to us, which is also an Example and Pattern; Christ's love
considered.
I considered Christ's Love as a Fountain and Root, And then the effect and
fruit of it in giving himself for us.

For the first, As a root and cause why he died.
I considered Christ's Love with the Object of it, us; showing it (as also the
Love of the Father) to be,

1. Free, not depending on any thing in man. Romans 11.35, 36.

2. Eternal, as being 1. from eternity, Jer. 31.3. 2. To Eteruity. John 13.1.
Romans 8.39.

3. Great and infinite. John 15.13. Greater Love has no m^n then this, that a
m^^ lay down his life for his friends.

This was such a love as whereby he paid the utmost farthing due to our sin.

Use. 1. And so it is not a common love, but specially of some.
To account nothing too dear for Him, etc.

2. Therefore this is not a common, but a choice love: and therefore seeing it
is such a love as he could not have showed greater, Let any judge whether it is
likely that he with like and equal love and intention died for all and each,
reprobate as well as Elect, otherwise then either in regard of the sufficiency
of the price paid, or of a common love and Philanthropy: and whether he loved,
whilst he died, the reprobate, Judas, Pilate, (yea Cain and Pharao then in
Hell) with the greatest love of all, As only of the elect.
and so that he could not have showed them greater love. For surely then there
should have been for them not only an impetration of reconciliation,
remission and salvation, but also an effectual Application thereof, as in the
elect. This greatest love then respects the elect only and such men as are
infallibly to be saved.

For the second, According to the effect of it, his death.
( And has given himself for us.) not to insist on these particulars, 1. Who
gave himself? Christ, God-man, 2. Whom gave he, or what, not an Angel, etc.
but himself: not silver and gold, etc. 1 Peter 1.18.

3. What to be, an offering and a sacrifice, etc.

4. To Whom; not to Satan, but to God, and that by way of price.

That which is chiefly of us now to be considered is, For whom especially did
Christ die, or give himself?


5. For whom Christ gave himself: For us, says the Text.

1. For us, enemies and sinners. Romans 5.6.8.10. but so we are all. Therefore,

2. For us] especially the elect, and such as do believe.

See the Apostles own exposition, Verse 23. Not for all mankind alike.
The husband is the head of the wif, even as Christ is the Head of his Church,
and he is the Savior of the body. Christ is the head and husband of his
Church, and these are holy ones, the elect people of God whom the Holy Ghost
does sanctify, as in our common Catechism. Christ then is an Head of such as
Adam was of all mankind. As only of the elect. He is the head of his Church.
For though Christ took on him man's nature, yet not as it is common.
Howsoever, as in each woman is the nature of man in common, yet each man is not
each woman's husband and head, but hers only to whom he is joined in a
special bond and contract, so here. Can we say all the wide World is Christ's
Church, or that every man throughout the world from the beginning belongs as a
member to this Head and Church?

So, And Savior of his body.
Christ is said to be the Savior of the body. He is a Savior of all, but
especially of those that believe* 1 Timothy 4.10. Do all believe? no, all men have
not faith. 1 These. 3.2. Are all members of Christ's Body?

So Verse 25, Christ loved the Church and gave himself for it, that he might
sanctify it, etc. Where Christ's spiritual Love and intent is showed, whilst
he offered himself, in regard of the infallible conferring of salvation, by
virtue of which love and Merits of Christ the elect have Faith, holiness,
perseverance and eternal life infallibly conferred upon them, as learned
Abbats reasons out of Romans 8.32. Abbats de veritate gratiae Christ^ p. 36
He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all: how shall
he not with him also freely give us all things? For whom therefore properly
he gave his Son, God giving Christ, gives with him all things,
to those also with his Son he gives all things; Repentance, Faith, Hope,
Charity, Perseverance, his Spirit, and by it, whatsoever is needful to
salvation. But these he gives not to all; and therefore all are not alike
loved, or alike in the Death of Christ. Therefore where the Apostle says, Pro
quibus nobis? praescitis, inquit, praedestinati^, etc. Aug^st^^^ Ioh. tract. 45.
Christ was delivered up for us all, Saint Augustine asks, for which us? and
answers, for us whom he did foreknow, predestinate, justify, glorify: as
Verse 30. Of whom it follows, Use 33, who shall lay any thing to the charge of
Gods Elect?

There is a power then in Christ's Death: Tit 2.14.
he gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and
purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good Works. Redemption
includes, 1. Gods acceptance.
And Redemption includes, 1. Acceptance into Gods favor, but is Christ's
offering a sweet smelling savor in regard of every one? so it must be for
every one whom he thus loved, and for whom he gave himself, it includes
Remission (even actual remission) of sin. Ephesians. 1.7. Pardon of sin.
In whom we have Redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, so
Colos. 1.14. Have all remission of sins?

3. Freedom from the power of sin.
Sanctification and freedom from the power and rage of sin, Redemption is
from our vain conversation, 1 Peter 1.18. And here Ephesians. 5 25, 26. He loved
the Church and gave himself for it, that he might sanctify and cleanse it,
etc. but are all sanctified.

In a word, Christ giving himself as a Husband to his Church indues his Church
with all his riches (oh how rich is every member of Christ!) As God gives his
Son, and the Son himself, so he gives with him all things also, as is said
Romans 8.32.

What are these things? And all things belonging to life and godliness.
All things pertaining to life and godliness -- to glory and virtue, 2 Pet.
1.3. That is, all things belonging both to the end and means: unto both which
we are elected: 2 These. 2.13.
-- God has from the beginning chosen you to salvation (lo, Which all men have
not.
there is the end) through sanctification of the spirit, and belief of the
truth (lo, these are the means.)

But see 1 Cor. 1.30 Christ is made to us (namely such as for whom he
specially gives himself) wisdom, Christ not being to all, but to some only,
righteousness, Sanctification, and redemption.

1 Wisdom, what? Wisdom
to all alike? no: I thank thee O Father because thou have hid these things
from the wise and prudent, and have revealed them unto Babes; even so Father,
for so it seemed good in thy sight.

2 Righteousness: What? Righteousness.
to all? Only to such as have faith, Romans 1.17. and 3.22. The righteousness
of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ, unto all and upon all that believe;
but all have not faith, as is said; faith is the gift of God. Ephesians. 2.7.
Therefore is it called the faith of Gods Elect, Tit. 1.1. All are not of God,
and therefore believe not, hear and obey not, Ioh. 8.46.47. why do ye not
believe me (says Christ) he that is of God hears Gods words: ye therefore
hear them not, because ye are not of God. All are not Christ's sheep, and
therefore all believe not; ye believe not, said Christ again to the Jews,
because ye are not of my sheep -- my sheep hear my vorce. Ioh. 10.26.27.

3 Christ is to his, Sanctification.
Sanctification; this is a fruit of the word, ( Sanctify them through thy
truth, thy word is truth, Ioh. 17.17.) and a gift of the Spirit. But is Christ
sanctification to all? no 1. his word sanctifies not all men, because never
intended for all Acts 16.6.7. Paul and Silas were forbidden of the holy Ghost
to preach the word in Asia: After they were come to Mys^a, they assayed to go
into Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them not.

2 His Spirit, like the wind, blows where it lists, Ioh. 3.8. namely on the
elect only savingly; he for them by dying purchased the spirit, by which his
benefits are made effectual.

4 Christ is made Redemption, but is that of all? Redemption.
no. -- Thou wast stain and have redeemed us to God by thy blood, out of every
kindred, and tongue, and people, and Nation. Revel. 5.9. Not all nations, but
some out of all, according to that of Paul, explaining whom he means by
Vessels of mercy, which God had before prepared unto Glory, Romans 9.23.24.
even us (says he) whom he has called, not of the Jews only, but of the
Gentiles: he says not all us Jews, or all us Gentiles, but us of the Jews and
Gentiles.

Objection. This doctrine is not against the doctrine of our Church.
This is against the doctrine of our Church, which tells us that the offering
of Christ made upon the cross, is a full, perfect and sufficient sacrifice,
oblation and satisfaction for the fins of the whole world. I answer, no: The
Church indeed uses the phrase of Scripture, but not against the sense of
Scripture, whose meaning therefore is the same with that of the Scripture; for
our Church does tell us, Artic. 20.
that ( as it is not lawful for the Church to ordain any thing that is
contrary to Gods Word, so, neither) may it so expound one place of Scripture
that it be repugnant to another. Therefore our Church uses not the Scripture
phrase so as to be repugnant to those other places named, or yet to it self
which (besides much more that might be said) in the 17. article, tells us,
That God has decreed by his Counsel secret to us, to deliver from curse and
damnation, those whom he has chosen in Christ out of mankind. So that, seeing
to deliver from curse and damnation is the effect of Christ's death according to
the everlasting purpose of God, Therefore Christ has not redeemed all mankind,
so as to deliver them from curse and damnation, seeing his everlasting purpose
and constant decree was to deliver from curse and damnation, not all Mankind,
but those whom he has chosen in Christ out of mankind. Redemption, in Gods
purpose and intention, reaches not beyond the decree.

Our Church then does not deny universal redemption: Which denies the equal
application of redemption to all.
for we truly say with it and with the Scripture, Christ died for all. Yet it
denies that equal and universal Application of this redemption, whose event
is suspended, and hangs either on the liberty of man's will, or on any
condition in man (which God will not work.) We deny not, but say that Christ
paid a price for all, but such as is to be applied to each by the means of
faith, which is not of all, and not by the very act or fact of his oblation, so
that, faith being presupposed, and coming between, all and each are capable
of salvation, and they are such as, believing, shall be saved.

Objection. But does not the Scripture invite all, and make promises to all,
and that truly, not fainedly? Math. 11.28. 1 Timothy 2.4. Romans 11.32:

I adswer, The promises are made to all upon condition of faith.
there is none but may truly and seriously be invited to partake of the pardon
of sin and of life by Christ's death, upon the condition of Faith. Be it
known unto you, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of
sins, Act. 13.38.39.
And by him all that believe are justified etc. And elsewhere, Acts 10.43
To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name, whosoever
believes in him, shall receive remission of sins. Now this is grounded on
the merit of Christ's death: Which generality is grounded upon Romans 3.24, 25.
The merits of Christ's death.
we being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in
Christ Jesus: whom God has set forth to be a propitiation, through faith in
his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins etc.

In this regard and upon this ground, if I were among the Barbarous heathen,
among Jews, Turks and Infidells, I (if I could speak to be understood of
them) would first endeavor to let them know Christ and his benefits, and then
I would seriously invite them all to believe on him, yea and would assuredly in
Christ's name, promise unto all true penitents and believers among them, pardon
of sin and life eternal, having (though I be no Apostle) warrant for the
same from our Savior himself, saying, Ma^^. 16.15 16.
Goyee into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature, he that
believes and is baptized, shall be saved: but he that believes not shall be
damned. And I would ground such exhortations and promises upon the merits of
Christ's death, Gods Word conjoynes inseparably, faith and salvation.
the fruit whereof does actually belong to such only as believe, as is said.
So Gods word does teach us, whose will (as we see in his word) does immutably
tie and conjoyne together repentance and pardon, faith and salvation, and
contrariwise. It excludes from pardon the impenitent, and from salvation the
unbeleever, upon which ground I say, if Pharaoh obey and believe, he shall be
saved: If the Ninevites believe they shall not perish. There Is no falsehood nor
mockery here, seeing the promise is conditional.

And though it be said by some, Gerh. ^d. Enchirid. consolator. D^y.
that God inviting all, such is his heart inwardly as he has manifested
himself outwardly, and that he bears the same mind to us, which he showed to
us in his son Christ, who is the image as of his essence, so of his will, and
that we must not think he shows himself kind outwardly, and yet inwardly
hates us.

I answer, Men must not be too bold to infer that God should equivocate and
deal hypocritically with men, whilst he invites and calls them to that
whereunto he effectually works not. How God even seriously invites men in his
word
Though Jesuiticall equivocations and Reservations do falsify and destroy the
Proposition uttered, yet Gods secret decrees never destroy or falsify his will
revealed; seeing as is said, Gods will in his word does connexe and tie
together the end and the means, repentance and pardon, faith and salvation,
life (eternal) and Godliness, 2 P^t. 1.3.
glory and virtue* (Both which and all things pertaining to both, his divine
power does give unto ^s.) Neither is the tru^^ o^ this connexe by any decree^
of God, or sin of man broken.

And as for Gods will, what Gods will, made known by Christ, is.
whereof Christ is both the Image and the interpreter, we may see it declared
by himself, in these words. First, Ioh. 6, 37.38, 39, 40.
says he, All that the Father gives me, shall come to me: and him that
comes to me, I will in no wise cast out; then he ads immediately, for I came
down from heaven, not to do mine own^ will, but the will of him tha^ sent me.
And this is the Fa^thers will which has sent me that of all which he has
given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.
And this is the wi^ of him that sent me, that every one which sees the Son
and believes on him may have everlasting life. Lo, Gods will in Christ is not
to save any but such as believe (I speak not now of infants) and all such he
will save; How God wills not the death of the wicked.
God then wills men's salvation in willing their faith and Repentance: and so he
wills not (yea and swears he wills not, or has no pleasure in) the death of
the wic^ed, Ezekiel. 33.
in that he wills not their sin and impeniten^y: Therefore its said, 11
cleared
I ^ave no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the ^ricked turn from
his way and ^ve: (that's it especially which God has pleasure ^in.) Therefore
it is added, Turn ye, turn ye from your ^vill ways, for why will ye die O
house of Israel? as if he ^ad said, if ye will not turn, ye must assuredly
dye: I have inseparably conjoined these two together, impenitency (persisted
in) and death. The truth is, in that place of Ezekiel, The people conceiving
that evils did befall them not for their own, but for their parents sins,
saying The Fathers have eaten sour grapes, Ezekiel. 18.2.4. and ver.
19.20.21.22.23.
and the childrens teeth are set on edg, the Lord there Ezekiel. 18. Where this
same doctrine and point is handled, swears that -- the soul^ which sins
shall dye (whether the soul of the Father or of the son) and tha^ the son
shall not bear the iniquity of the Father -- bu^ if the wicked will turn
fr^^ all his sins -- he shall sure^^ live, and not die. And the^ it
follows, have I any pleasure at all that the wicke^ should dye? and not that
he should return from his ways and live? and 31.
cast away from you all your trangressions -- for ^hy will ye die, O house of
Isrell.

God therefore answe^ing their objection, who thought themselves puni^hed for
their parents sins, denies the same, and tells them it is for their own
sins; and whereas they thus spoke, Ezekiel. 33.10 11.
if our transgressions and our sins be upon us, and we pine away in them,
how should we then live? The answer in effect is, by repentance; unto which
God accordingly exhorts them, saying and swearing, as I live, I have no
pleasure etc. as formerly; so he swears, he had rather they should repent and
live (seeing these two are inseparable, and without repentance, no life) then
persist in impenitency (whilst they shuffled off their sins to their
Fathers) and so perish: (which two also are inseparable:) so that if they
persist in impenitency, his will then is they shall perish. God does truly will
the death of impenitent sinners, who will deny it? and when he wills not their
death, it is as much as if he had said he will not their sin and
impenitency: but if they would go on in sin, he must and did will their
death. Therefore he says, turn ye, turn ye, why will ye dye? i. Why will ye
run upon your own death? and yet he assures them by oath) they dyed not but
for their sin, though they thought otherwise.

So, on the other hand, How God wills the salvation of all.
God wills men's salvation, in willing their faith and repentance, and so he
wills that all men should be saved; 1 Timothy, 2, 4.
and so wills the salvation even of such as perish; but how? first by approving
it if it were done, Even of such as per^^^. 1 By approving (...) ^ (...), not
by decreeing the event.
but not by decreeing the extent, nor yet so as to work it by special and
effectual grace. The obedience and faith, suppose of Pharaoh, had been a
thing pleasing to God: but it was not a thing to be given by God from Gods
decree. But for those that are saved he so wills their salvation that he
decrees the same, and according to his decree, infallibly produces the same,
according to that of Christ, Ioh. 6 37. Ier. 31.3.
All that the father gives me, shall come unto me, and of God, I have loved
thee with an everlasting love, Therefore with loving kindness have I drawn
thee. The one is according to his will revealed, The distinction of Gods will
secret and revealed justified.
his signifying will, the other according to his secret will, or the will of
his good pleasure; which ancient distinction of the Schools must not be so
s^eighted, or so easily cried down; and our Church does hold it, Artic, 17
whilst in the 17. Article it uses first these words, he has constantly
decreed by his Counsel secret to us: and these again in the end of that
article, In our doings that will of God is to be followed which we have
expressly declared unto us in the word of God. So that it would not
impertinently be thought on what God wills by the will of his precept, and what
he wills by the will of his decree: what Gods will is to me concerning that
he would have me do, and what he wills with himself in his own secret
Counsel; what he wills at my hand as my duty, what he will bestow upon me
freely as a blessing. God seriously wills me to do my duty, and shows me
what would be acceptable to him, as namely to pray for all men; (...) 2.3.
and to make no exception of any, but to further, every man's salvation: but,
says Austen, (...) (...) (...) and (...) (...)
if the Church were certain who (in particular) were predestined to go into
everlas^ing fire with the devil, It would as little pray for them (though yet
living on earth) as it does for him.

2 God so far wills the salvation of all, By giving men so much grace as to
leave them faulty if they answer it not.
that he seriously exhorts sinners to repent, and accordingly in his Gospel
gives them so much grace, knowledge and good motions and so far enables them
thereunto, that there is a true fault in them that repent not; that is, there
is either contempt or neglect of the Gospel, and so indeed, besides their
other sins, a new fault against the Gospel, whence their condemnation
becomes the greater, and the condition of such as never heard of Christ more
tolerable at the day of judgment then theirs. Math. 11.21, 22, 23.24.
Therefore (besides that God gave men power sufficient in Adam to do what he
requires and that men have disabled themselves to do that which he otherwise
has right to require) I say God, upon the forenamed ground, may seriously
invite all, exhort all, and require of them that, which he gives them so much
grace to perform, that it is out of their own deficiency if they perform it
not: and withal may punish them justly for not doing it their perishing is of
themselves: Man is never punished but for his own sin. Only God gives not
that powerful grace to them (as he is not bound) by which (as depending on
his election) infallibly they might convert.

Here is then the mystery; Christ's merits are availeable to all believers:
Though God invite all, and promise life to all upon the condition of faith,
and that promise be grounded, as is granted, upon the merits of Christ's death,
yet the fruit of Christ's death does actually belong only to such as believe.
The price paid for all, and which shall certainly be to the salvation of
believers, yet profits not all, But to believe is not g^ven to all.
because faith is not given to all (as not the means of faith) but to the
Elect only.

We therefore preach and teach that Christ dyed for all, How Christ dyed for
all men.
so as that all and each, may, by the virtue of Christ's death, through faith
(the Gospel once coming to them) may I say obtain remission of sin and life;
and so Christ's death has purchased a possibility of salvation for all men, if
all men can believe.

But we say again that Christ so dyed for the Elect that, How only for the
Elect.
by virtue of the merit of his death (which was specially intended for them
according to Gods eternal decree) they not only might, but should infallibly
attain faith here, and obtain life eternal hereafter, (and that without any
co^pulsion of their wills.

Hence it comes to pass (though the particularitie of Gods promises be
objected as an odious doctrine and comfortless) that the promises of the
Gospel are of two sorts. Gerhard. ^^ ^pri. G^ds promises distingu^sbed* 1.
Conditional which are m^^e gene^^l.
1. Conditional, and of the end which is salvation, requiring faith and
repentance; and so Gods promises are general, and he seriously invites all,
and mocks none who perform the condition. Absolute, which are particular.
2. Absolute, and of the Means: whereby, as he absolutely, (and without
condition required of us) promised Christ himself Genesis 3.15. so also both the
outward, and also inward effectual Means, as the working of faith, writing
his Laws in our hearts, Ier. 31.33.34* and 32.40.
putting his fear in our hearts that we depart not from him, etc.

Which, as they depend not on any condition in man, but only on Gods free,
absolute and immutable decree, so do they particularly and specially belong to
the Elect, and not to all. Let any show me a promise in Scripture whereby God
has promised to give faith universally to all without exception. But who these
in particular are, the effects of Gods eternal love, manifested in time on and
in them, do and will show and declare.

An Additionall.
Showing the true state of the aforesaid question (mistaken by the opposer) and
the truth further strengthened by the same arguments (s^ the Doctrine of our
Church and of Scripture) (...) which it was o^pose ^^with the best way of
^econciling see^^ing contrarieties and ^^^trudicti^^s of S^^ptu^^, in the ^oint
of Gods free grace and man's Free Will.

THe former Doctrine concerning the extent of Christ's Death, though seemingly
opposed, yet was but lightly hurt, seeing the true state of the question, as it
was handled, was not so much as touched. That which the opposer undertook to
prove (on the Text, Arminian grounds for their universal Redemption*
Romans 4.25.) was, That Christ died for the sins of all and each. Which he
would prove. 1. from the Doctrine of our Church, or from some passages out of
the Common Prayer Book, Homilies and Articles. 2. From the Scripture, showing
that it teaches that Christ died,

1. For the World. John 3.16, 17. 1 Ioh. 2, 2.

2. For all men. Esaias. 53.6. Tim. 2 6. Heb. 2.9.

3. For ^uch 1. as might h^ve perished, Romans 14.15. 1 Cor. 3.11. 2. as do
Perish 2 Pet. 2. 1. Heb. 6.6.

With Lutheran answers to that interpretation which we give of these places.

Now I, The true state of the question. Christ died not with like intention to
save all. Which is showed,
(whose purpose was (and is) to defend my self and the Doctrine taught by me,
and as it was taught by me) do avow that in all this, the state of the
question is mistaken, which was not and is not, Whether Christ died for all men
and each, but whether for all alike, and out of equal love, and a like
intention of saving all.

Therefore to the proofs brought and alleged I think good only to answer by
opposing like, yea, much stronger proofs both from our Churches Doctrine, but
especially from the Scriptures. The chief difficulty will be in reconciling of
the seeming differences.

1. Our Church, To be the doctrine of our Church, which shows Christ died for
his servants and people. Te Deum.
as it tells us of Christ's full perfect and sufficient sacrifice, oblation, and
satisfaction for the sins of the whole World, so it tells us also for whom
more specially he died, and whom he redeemed. We pray thee help thy servants
whom thou host redeemed with thy most precious blood, and O Lord save thy
people, What people? not all,
and make thy chosen people joy full. But what people is that? not every people
or person (alike) Thou have multiplied the Nation, and not increased the Joy.
Esaias 9.3. According to the double expression of the promise made to Abraham,
Genesis 22.17.
I will multiply thy seed ^s the Stars of the Heaven, (by which may, at least
by allusion, But believers.
be meant the children of Abraham's faith, the elect,) and as the sand, which is
upon the Seashore. The dark sands are more in number, but not so lightsome as
the Stars.

So, Benedictus Who are these?
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for he has visited and redeemed his
people: and thou did open the Kingdom of Heaven to all believers now, who
are these his people and believers, his Church
but the Church of God? Grant that by the Merits and Death of thy Son Jesus
Christ, Communion.

Now who or what is this Church, but the chosen people of God, Collect for All

This last shows what is meant by the former answer -- has Redeemed me and all

And Almighty God -- in whom the souls of them that be elected, after they be

compared with these words, Collect for good Friday.
Almighty God, we beseech thee graciously to behold this thy family, for the
which our Lord Jesus Christ was contented to be betrayed -- and to suffer

The like in the 17* Article, Article 17.
where we are told that God has decreed by his Counsel secret to us to
deliver from curse and damnation those whom he has chosen in Christ out of
mankind, etc. Now redemption from curse and damnation (the proper effect of
Christ's death) does not, in Gods intention go beyond the decree (as above page
586.) And Article, And 29.

The wicked and such as be void of a lively faith, although they do carnally
and visibly press with their teeth the Sacrament of the body and blood of
Christ, yet in no wise are they partakers of Christ; if in no wise, then he
impetrated not for them remission of sin and other benefits of his death. And
these allegations may be opposed to those other which from the same books and
doctrine of our Church have been alleged, sufficient to weaken whatsoever
authority either is or seems to be in the same.

The Scriptures also, It is the Doctrine of the Scriptures.
as has been proved (page 12.3.) show that Christ died not equally and with
the same intention for all, see Tit. 2.14. -- a peculiar people. so Ephesians. 5.2.
with 23.25. He is the Head of his Church of the elect, as formerly) and the
Savior of the body. Of his Church: so Ambrose, Ambrrs. in Luc. c. 7. l. 6.
Though Christ suffered for all, yet specially he suffered for us, because he
suffered for his Church; whereby as one of our late worthies infers, he
clearly signifies that so Christ died for all, Abbot de verit gratiae Christi
p. 35.

Christ is the Head only of his body and of his Church.


as that yet in the death of Christ all are not to be thought or conceived to
be equal or alike: he died in common for all, but specially for the Church: to
wit his will was to satisfy for all by the dignity and worth of the price paid,
but by the will of his good purpose he did impetrate (and obtain pardon)
only for the elect, that is, for the Church; so that we may and must
distinguish the greatness of the price paid, and the propriety of redemption.

And what says our Savior? Dying only for his sheep.
I l^y down my life for the sheep. John 10. verse 11.15. If it be said all
men are Christ's sheep, that is, confuted, ver. 27, 28. compared with 26. for
his sheep hear ^is voice -- and never perish -- but ye believe not, (says
he ^o those Jews that would ^ot hear, i. Harken to and ^elieve his voice)
because ye ^^e not of my sheep.

But its said (by the Ar^inians,) Objection.

and why then ^ay not God be said also ^elect believers, that is, such (...)

in Gods decree: and he calls them sheep even before their conversion in
respect of his decree, as Verse 16. Other sheep^ I have which are not of this
fold, etc. These were given to Christ before they were (actually) sheep: eve^
that they might be so. For if they were not given t^ Christ till after, then
the^ should give themselves t^ Christ, before God ga^^ them to him -- So John
1^.13. And for his friends.
Christ laid down his (...) for his friends: (that is, (...) Gods decree
friends, (...) themselves enemies,) or (...) his Church, Redemption which is
the elect of Christ death, implies in it a d^verance of the redeem^ from the
power of darkness, and a translation of us into the Kingdom of his dear
Son; yea remission of sins; in whom we have redemption through his blood,
Colos. 1.13.14, 15.
even the forgiveness of sins. Now these belong not to all, but are the
inheritance of the Saints, for whose redemption Christ more specially and
intentionally died.

These things and places of Scripture would be considered and thought on with
those other places which simply an universalitie of Redemption. How the seeming
differences of Scripture in this point may be reconciled.
And if there ^ee truth in the one; so is there also in the other. The
Scriptures do not contradict, but explain and interpret themselves.

How shall we then Reconcile these things? if the right stating of the
question, such as we have heard, will not do it, what then will do it? I have
heard of one, who, being a man of place, had a complaint came before him, and
when he heard the first party speak concluded it must needs be true he said:
and after, hearing the other tell his tale, (he could not see but that) he
spoke truth too: and yet one of them spoke against the other. Doubtless his
inability to decide the controversy proceeded from imbecillitie of judgment;
Men's weakness of judgment to do it.
as does also the Popes, who, though he pretend an infallibility (...)
judgment, An example in the Pope.
and to be judge of controversies, yet when this debate, or the like including
this, between^ the Dominicans and Jesuits came before him and was discussed,
Injunctions of silence on both sides will not do (...).
he thought the best way of decision was to injoyne both party silence, so in
effect leaving each side to believe his own tenets as truth, when yet both
cannot be true. But we are sure that Gods word is truth in all the parts of it,
and in no part opposes it self.

What shall we then do in our case? In a Proclamation to suppress Doctor
(...) Book Ia^. 17. 1628.
shall we reconcile these, by procuring a restraint of both parties, that
neither by public reading, preaching or making books, either Pro or contra,
concerning these differences they begin anew to dispute. This was once done,
but in the intentions of the procurers thereof, most subtly and fraudulently
as we have cause to imagine, if we may judge by the effects, for thereby quite
contrary to his Majesty's gracious intentions, who desired peace, they made use
of it for their own ends to promote the Arminian cause, playing fast and loose
with it, urging it only against their opposers, whilst others presumed to take
liberty, presuming on the favor of such, as in case of complaint they knew
must be their Judges. But (let the Kings throne ever be guiltless) this was,
under such color, made use of the Arminian party, and intended by them, to
supplant and suppress the truth of God, which we know they had (and the rather
by this means) well nigh effected. This then is not the way.

What then? how shall we then reconcile these differences? will the distinction
of Impetration (by Christ) and Application (by man) do it? The distinction of
Impetration by Christ, And Application by the power of ma^sw^l. w^l not do it.
as if Christ by his death and the merits of it did obtain grace and
reconciliation for all men, but did leave the effectual application thereof to
themselves, and to the right use and employment of their own free will, giving
them a power to believe, repent, and in a word, to be saved if they will, but
leaving the will to themselves? Surely no. This has been sufficiently
confuted before. Christ is and must be a Savior both by the merit of his
death, and by the efficacy, and power of his Spirit, Christ is our Sa^iour as
well by his spirit and the power thereof as by his Merit.
the sending of the Spirit and giving it is a fruit of his death; and our
justification is the effect both of his death and resurrection: yea remission
of sins is, as we lately heard, a great part of our redemption. But thus to
teach, what is it but to say that Christ did not obtain that this his
reconciliation should be applied to all for whom it was merited? or that
deliverance is obtained for one, suppose in prison, but not that he might
(certainly) be delivered, no, we have heard the will is as well from God and
his grace, as the Power, the act of believing as well as the power to believe
if we will. God once giving Christ, gives all things needful also, as it is
said out of Rom 8.32.33, etc.

This reconcilement then implies first freewill in man: which is, as I
conceive, Against man's free will.
the maine mark which many shoot at, this (such is the pride of nature
corrupt) they must and will maintain, and accordingly frame all other their
tenants concerning Gods predestination and the extent of Christ's death, etc. to
uphold this. But I ask: The elect are saved infallibly.
did Christ only die that we might be saved if we will? I know God compells
no man; man wills freely when he wills, as being enabled so to will by Gods
effectual grace: and so, And (...)
in regard of God he wills infallibly, and infallibly is saved, yet still in
regard of himself, freely (God sweetly drawing him and making him willing)
even as chance and counsel may stand together. But for God and Christ only to
purchase this power, But not by power of their own will.
pardon and reconciliation, and then, for the application, Man's freewill and
choice is determined by God.
to leave it to the power of man's will (not specially actuated by God) what is
this but to make Gods decree to hang upon man's will, when yet his decree
determines al inferior causes? Gods decree should be uncertain.
2. Yea to make Gods purposes and decree (for particular men especially)
uncertain seeing a co^ditionall decree (as well as a conditional proposition)
puts nothing into being (or affirms nothing certainly) yea so it is possible
God should not have a Church on earth, and Christ should be a Head without a
body or members, if their conversion depended thus on themselves: Adam when he
truly had freewill, And so should also conversion be.
yet used it to his hurt: how much less can we, now in state of corruption,
and disabled by sin, and having the same Devil to tempt us, be able to
stand out against temptations? So that it is not only possible, but probable,
if it were left to our will and choice, that there should be no conversion in
the World, nay almost Impossible (all things considered) that it should be
otherwise. No, no, The conversion, and so the preseverance in grace, and
salvation of the elect, is not left uncertain. See John 6.37. Jeremy. 31.3.
and 32.40. And 3. As Gods Word, so our Churches Doctrine is against freewill,
as in the Collects for the second Sunday (as they call it) in Lent and for
Easter day (for I know against whom I do dispute,) Our Churches Doctrine is
against fr^e-will.
but especially in the tenth Article, where we teach: Man cannot turn or
prepare himself by his own natural strength and good works to Faith and
calling upon God. Wherefore we have no power to do good works acceptable to
God, without the grace of God by Christ preventing us, that we may have a good
will, and working with us when we have that good will.

Again, by this Doctrine* The differenting of one man from an other is left to
man himself (seeing God is alike in his love and intent to all) which is
directly contrary to the Apostle 1 Cor. 4.7. So is the Scripture.
Who disting^isheth thee, or makes thee to differ from another? 1 Cor. 4.7.
And what have thou which thou did not receive? yea, and so a man might even
glory with God himself, as that text shows, and as has been showed formerly.

How then? shall we, Differences in Scripture reconciled not by men's wresting
of Scripture.
(for the reconciling of these seeming differences) take upon us to interpret
Scripture as we would have it speak for our own purpose? God forbid: Let us
take the genuine sense, and it will agree well enough with other Scriptures, if
we would use diligence and set aside foreconceits; only our care must be so to
interpret one place (which may seem to make for our purpose) as to make and
leave it consonant or to agree with other places, and as it is commonly called,
with the analogy or Proportion of faith* But what if we cannot make these
agree, But by bringing their understandings in obedience to the word,
so as to satisfy our selves? In this case, let us ingenuously and as there is
true cause, suspect, yea acknowledge our own shallowness and our Ignorance,
which only makes all Contradictions in Scripture; must we be wiser or full
out so wise as is God himself? If God please to keep secret from us the
connection of things, the order and manner of his working, It will become us to
search no further (for there is no searching of his understanding) but to rest
in that which is clearly revealed, By resting in things revealed,
and in such things (so in the general revealed, though for manner and
circumstance not so clearly conceived) to deny our own reason, and to bring
with us an humility of understanding (I mean not in the Popish sense, to
believe, by an implicit faith, what by men's authority, Without determining of
things secret.
under pretense of the Church shall be imposed upon us; but) to submit to the
truth of Gods word, and of the Scriptures, the authority of which is greater
then the whole capacity of humane understanding and wit, as one speaks, and
that generally in all such things as we otherwise can s^e no reason of; as for
example: when judgments, (like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah etc.) were
to befall Gods people of Israel and Judah, so that the question (in regard of
the strangeness and circumstances of the evils) was foretold to be, Deuteronomy.
29.23, 24, 25
wherefore has the Lord done thus unto this Land? what means the heat of
this great anger? men shall give this answer, and say, It was because they have
forsaken the Covenant of the Lord God of their fathers etc now this answer
might soon and safely be given out of the revealed will and word of God: but if
any would inquire further, as how or whence it came that God would suffer them
so to provoke him, and not stay them by his power etc. their mouth is stopped
with that which follows, And verse 29.
The secret things belong unto the Lord our God: but those things which are
revealed, belong unto us, and to our children for ever, that we may do all the
words of this Law. That they were destroyed, for their sin is evident, that is
revealed; but if you inquire into any higher cause in God, that is a secret, and
we should sin to seek a reason of his counsels; here we should captivate
our reason and understanding to Christ's word, not diving into the reason or
depth of Gods doings and judgments, as knowing most certainly that both that
is most true which he speaks, and just which he does, as an ancient writer
truly speaks; and with Paul cry out -- O depth -- how unsearchable are his
judgments, and his ways past finding out? we eannot call that unjust in
which we cannot deny the judgment of God: To. 11.33.
for his will is the chief and supreme Justice of all: neither is that
therefore not just which God does, because man cannot comprehend the power of
his Justice, says Salvian. Curiosity condemned,
The instance given is not impertinent to the case in hand; Christ died for all
men, yet the most of men by Gods just judgment perish in their sins, and (if
we speak of those that have heard of Christ) in and for their unbeleefe and
impenitencie. This is the only cause of their perishing which we are to look
unto: if we will needs search and look higher, As dangerous.
and seek out reasons of Gods will, we shall lose our selves and the truth
too; if we will needs pry into the arc, we shall be destroyed, with those of
Bethshemesh; if we will search and gaze upon the majesty of God and dive into
those depths we shall be overwhelmed with his glory, and perhaps, come into
the bottomless depth of all: our only wisdom will be to become fools that
we may be wise, 1 Cor. 3.18. The best answer of doubtful things in Scripture,
is our faith to believe what God teaches when we see not the reason of it.
if ever we would profit in Gods School; and to deny our own reason where
God denies to give a reason. Points of this Nature are matters of faith, not of
dispute; and faith will believe that it sees not, and yield its assent to those
things the causes whereof it know not: which rule I wish it were as well
practiced, as is well said by an Arminian. Of such things and doubts as we
cannot easily answer, especially in reconciling seeming differences, bring
faith (says an ancient Father and martyr) that is a ready solution of all
doubts. Let us not lean to our own understanding: Iusti^. (...).
none is (says prosper) a more eloquen^ preacher and publisher of such deep
mysteries and secrets then he that confesses that the things which he
teaches are such as cannot be expressed. And so I will conclude with a saying
of Cajetane in the case of Gods particular Election of some according to his
(Immutable) decree, Cajetane. in Romans 9.
and of man's free will (free from compulsion) which case includes this of ours,
which is, Christ died for all men; and Christ died specially and with intention
and purpose according to Election to save some only, namely the Elect: This
only will quiet our understanding.
I find (says he of the one, and I of the other,) both in the Scripture: both
are true: now if you shall say, join these two true things together, make them
agree J answer, I know for certain that one truth is not contrary to another,
but how to conjoyne them, I know not: This Ignorance quiets my understanding.
And so in this our case, if that which has otherwise been said will not do
it, seeing both truths are evidently taught in Scripture, Let not us oppose the
one to overthrow the other (for in the ^ence explaned, It may ^e ^^anted that
Christ died (...) all men) but rather in this and in all other like cases, let
(...) acknowledge ^our own weakness of judgment and Ignorance; and let this
Ignorance quiet and bound our understandings.

FJNIS.
