Printed in the year of our LORD, 1649.

A MANIFESTATION FROM Lieutenant Colonel John Lilburn, Master William Walwyne,
Master Thomas Prince, and Master Richard Overton (now prisoners in the Tower of
London) and others, commonly (though unjustly) styled Levellers.
SInce no man is born for himself only, but obliged by the Laws of Nature
(which reaches all) of Christianity (which ingages us at Christians) and of
Public Society and Government, to employ our endeavors for the advancement
of a communitive Happiness, of equal concernment to others as our selves:
here have we (according to that measure of understanding God has dispensed
unto us) labored with much weakness indeed, but with integrity of heart, to
produce out of the Common Calamities, such a proportion of Freedom and good to
the Nation, as might somewhat compensate its many grievances and lasting
sufferings: And although in doing thereof we have hitherto reaped only
Reproach, and hatred for our good Will, and been feign to wrestle with the
violent passions of Powers and Principalities; yet since it is nothing so much
as our Blessed Master and his Followers suffered before us, and but what at
first we reckoned upon, we cannot be thereby any whit dismayed in the
performance of our duties, supported inwardly by the Innocence and evennesse of
our Consciences.

It Is a very great unhappiness we well know, to be always struggling and
striving in the world, and does wholly keep us from the enjoyment of those
contentments our several Conditions reach unto: So that if we should consult
only with our selves, and regard only our own ease, We should never enterpose
as we have done, in behalf of the Commonwealth: But when so much has been
done for recovery of our Liberties, and seeing God has so blessed that which has
been done, as thereby to clear the way, and to afford an opportunity which
these 600 years has been desired, but could never be attained; of making this a
truly happy and wh^lly Free Nation; We think our selves bound by the greatest
obligations that may be, to prevent the neglect of this opportunity, and to
hinder as much as lies in us, that the blood which has been shed be not spilt
like water upon the ground, nor that after the abundant Calamities, which have
overspread all quarters of the Land, the change be only Notionall, Nominall,
Circumstantiall, whilst the real Burdens, Grievances, and Bondages, be
continued, even when the Monarchy is changed into a Republike.

We are no more concerned indeed then other men, and could bear the Yoke we
believe as easily as others; but since a Common Duty lies upon every man to be
cautious and circumspect in behalf of his Country, especially while the
Government thereof is settling, other men's neglect is so far we think from
being a just motive to us of the like sloth aninanimiadvertency, as that it
rather requires of us an increase of care and circumspection which if it
produces not so good a settlement as ought to be, yet certainly it will prevent
its being so bad as otherwise it would be, if we should all only mind our
particular callings and employments.

So that although personally we may suffer, yet our solace is that the
Commonwealth is thereby some gainer, and we doubt not but that God in his due
time will so clearly dispel the Clouds of Ignominy and Obloquy which now
surround us by keeping our hearts upright and our spirits sincerely public,
that every good man will give us the right hand of fellowship, and be even
sorry that they have been estranged, and so hardly opinionated against us: We
question not but that in time the reason of such misprisions will appear to be
in their eyes and not in our Actions, in the false Representation of things to
them and improper glosses that are put upon every thing we do or say: In our
own behalfs we have as yet said nothing, trusting that either shame and
Christian duty would restrain men from making so bold with others good Name
and Reputation, or that the sincerity of our actions would evince the falsehood
of these scandals, and prevent the Peoples Belief of them; But we have found
that with too much greediness they suck in Reports that tend to the discredit
of others, and that our silence gives encouragement to bad Rumors of us; so
that in all places they are spread, and industriously propagated as well
amongst them that know us, as them that know us not, the first being fed with
Jealousies that there is more in our designs then appears, that there is
something of danger in the bottom of our hearts, not yet discovered: that we
are driven on by others, that we are even discontented and irresolved, that no
body yet knows what we would have, or where our desires will end; whilst they
that know us not are made believe any strange conceit of us, that we would
Level all men's estates, that we would have no distinction of Orders and
Dignities amongst men, that we are indeed for no government, but a Popular
consusion; and then again that we have bin Agents for the King, and now for
the Queen; That we are Atheists, Antiscripturists, Jesuits and indeed any
thing, that is hateful and of evil repute amongst men.

All which we could without observance pass over, remembering what is promised
to be the Portion of good men, were the damage only personal, but since the
ends of such Rumors are purposely to make us useless and unserviceable to the
Commonwealth, we are necessitated to open our breasts and show the world our
insides, for removing of those seandalls that lie upon us, and likewise for
manifesting plainly and particularly what our desires are, and in what we will
center and acquiess: all which we shall present to public view and
consideration, not pertinatiously or Magisterially, as concluding other men's
judgments, but manifesting our own, for our further vindication, and for the
procuring of a Bond and lasting establishment for the Commonwealth.

First, Then it will be requisite that we express our selves concerning
Levelling, for which we suppose is commonly meant an equalling of men's estates,
and taking away the proper right and Title that every man has to what is his
own. This as we have formerly declared against, particularly in our petition of
the 11 of Sept. so do we again profess that to attempt an inducing the same is
most injurious, unless there did precede an universal assent thereunto from
all and every one of the People. Nor do we, under favor, judge it within the
Power of a Representative it self, because although their power is supreme,
yet it is but deputative and of trust, and consequently must be restrained
expressly or tacitly, to some particulars essential as well to the Peoples
safety and freedom as to the present Government

The Community amongst the primitive Christians, was Voluntary, not Coactive;
they brought their goods and laid them at the Apostles feet, they were not
enjoined to bring them, it was the effect of their Charity and heavenly
mindedness, which the blessed Apostles begot in them, and not the Injunction
of any Constitution, which as it was but for a short time done, and in but two
or three places, that the Scripture makes mention of, so does the very doing of
it there and the Apostles answer to him that detained a part, imply that it was
not esteemed a duty, but reckoned a voluntary act occasioned by the abundant
measure of faith that was in those Christians and Apostles.

We profess therefore that we never had it in our thoughts to Level men's
esttates, it being the utmost of our aim that the Commonwealth be reduced to
such a pass that every man may with as much security as may be enjoy his
propriety.

We know very well that in all Ages those men that engage themselves against
Tyranny, unjust and Arbitrary proceedings in Magistrates, have suffered under
such appellations, the People being purposely frighted from that which is good
by insinuations of imaginary evil.

But be it so, we must notwithstanding discharge our Duties, which being
performed, the success is in Gods hand to whose good pleasure we must leave
the clearing of men's spirits, our only certainty being Tranquillity of mind,
and peace of Conscience.

For distinction of Orders and Dignities, We think them so far needful, as
they are animosities of virtue, or requisite for the maintenance of the
Magistracy and Government, we think they were never intended for the
nourishment of Ambition, or subjugation of the People but only to preserve the
due respect and obedience in the People which is necessary for the better
execution of the Laws.

That we are for Government and against Popular Confusion, we conceive all our
actions declare, when rightly considered, our aim having bin all along to
reduce it as near as might be to perfection, and certainly we know very well
the pravity and corruption of man's heart is such that there could be no living
without it; and that though Tyranny is so excessively bad, yet of the two
extremes, Confusion is the worst: It Is somewhat a strange consequence to infer
that because we have labored so earnestly for a good Government, therefore we
would have none at all; Because we would have the dead and exorbitant Branches
pruned, and better sciens grafted, therefore we would pluck the Tree up by the
roots.

Yet thus have we been misconceived, and misrepresented to the world, under
which we must suffer, till God sees it fitting in his good time to clear such
harsh mistakes, by which many, even good men keep a distance from us.

For those weak suppositions of some of us being Agents for the King or Queen,
we think it needful to say no more but this, That though we have not bin any
way violent against the persons of them, or their Party, as having aimed at
the conversion of all, and the destruction of none, yet do we verily believe
that those Principles and Maxims of Government which are most fundamentally
opposite to the Prerogative, and the Kings interest, take their first rise and
original from us, many whereof though at first starled at, and disowned by
those that professed the greatest opposition to him, have yet since been taken
up by them and put in practice: and this we think is sufficient, though much
more might be said to clear us from any Agency for that Party.

It is likewise suggested that we are acted by others, who have other ends then
appear to us; we answer. That that cannot be, since every thing has its rise
amongst our selves, and since those things we bring to light cannot conduce to
the ends of any but the public weal of the Nation.

All our Desires, Petitions and Papers are directly opposite to all corrupt
Interests; nor have any, credit with us, but persons well known, and of certain
aboads, and such as have given sound and undeniable testimonies of the truth of
their affection to their Country: Besides, the things we promote, are not good
only in appearance, but sensibly so: not molded nor contrived by the subtle
or politic Principles of the World, but plainly produced and nakedly sent,
without any insinuating arts, relying wholly upon the apparent and universal
belief they carry in themselves; and that is it which convinces and engages us
in the promotion thereof. So that that suggestion has not in^eed any foundation
in it self, but is purposely framed, as we conceive, to make us afraid one of
another, and to disable us in the promotion of those good things that tend to
the freedom and happiness of the Commonwealth.

For our being Jesuits, either in Order or Principles, as it is severally
reported of us; Though the easiest Negative is hardly proved; yet we can say,
That those on whom the first is principally fixed, are married, and were never
over Sea: and we think Marriage is never dispensed withal in that Order, and
that none can be admitted into the Order but such as are personally present.
It Is hard that we are put to express thus much; and happily we might better
pass such reports over in silence; but that we believe the very mentioning of
them publicly, will be an answer to them, and make such as foment them ashamed
of such generally condemned ways of discrediting and blasting the Reputation
of other men. For the principles of Jesuits, we profess we know not what they
are; but they are generally said to be full of craft and worldly policy; and
therefore exceedingly different from that plainness and simplicity that is
apparently visible in all our proceedings.

Whereas its said, we are Atheists and Antiscripturists, we profess that we
believe there is one eternal and omnipotent God, the Author and Preserver of
all things in the world. To whose will and directions, written first in our
hearts, and afterward in his blessed Word, we ought to square our actions and
conversations. And though we are not so strict upon the formal and Ceremonial
part of his Service, the method, manner, and personal injunction being not so
clearly made out unto us, nor the necessary requisites which his Officers and
Ministers ought to be furnished withal as yet appearing to some of us in any
that pretend thereunto: yet for the manifestation of Gods love in Christ, it is
clearly assented unto by us; and the practical and most real part of Religion
is as readily submitted unto by us, as being, in our apprehensions, the most
eminent and the most excellent in the world, and as proceeding from no other
but that God who is Goodness it self: and we humbly desire his Goodness daily
more and more to conform our hearts to a willing and sincere obedience
thereunto.

For our not being preferred to Offices and Places of profit and credit, which
is urged to be the ground of our dissatisfaction, we say, That although we know
no reason why we should not be equally capable of them with other men, nor why
our public Affection should be any bar or hinderance thereunto: Yet on the
other side, we suppose we can truly say of our selves, that we have not been so
earnest and solicitous after them as others: and that in the Catalogue of
Suitors, very few that are reckoned of us, are to be found. We are very sorry
that so general a change of Officers is proposed, which we judge of no small
disparagement to our Cause; and do think it best, that in removals of that
kind, the ground should not be difference in opinion, either in Religious or
Civil Matters, but corruption or breach of Trust; considering the misery which
befalls whole Families upon such Changes; and that discontents are thereby
increased: Whereas we hold it necessary that all ways of composure and
acquieting those storms which the preceding differences and distractions have
begotten, be with utmost care and prudence endeavored.

And whereas it is urged, That if we were in power, we would bear our selves as
Tyrannically as other have done: We confess indeed, that the experimental
defections of so many men as have succeeded in Authority, and the exceeding
difference we have hitherto found in the same men in a low, and in an exalted
condition, makes us even mistrust our own hearts, and hardly believe our own
Resolutions of the contrary. And therefore we have proposed such an
Establishment, as supposing men to be too flexible and yielding to worldly
Temptations, they should not yet have a means or opportunity either to injure
particulars, or prejudice the Public, without extreme hazard, and apparent
danger to themselves. Besides, to the objection we have further to say, That we
aim not at power in our selves, our Principles and Desires being in no measure
of self-concernment: nor do we rely for obtaining the same upon strength, or a
forcible obstruction; but solely upon that inbred and persuasive power that is
in all good and just things, to make their own way in the hearts of men, and so
to procure their own Establishment.

And that makes us at this time naked and defencelesse as we are, and amidst so
many discouragements on all hands to persevere in our motions and desires of
good to the Nation; although disowned therein at such a time when the doing
thereof can be interpreted no other but a politic delivering us up to
slaughter, by such as we took for Friends, our brethren of several Churches;
and for whom with truth of affection we have even in the most difficult times
done many Services: all which, and whatsoever else can be done against us, we
shall reckon but as badges of our sincerity, and be no whit discouraged thereby
from the discharge of our duties.

For the dis-satisfactions that be upon many good men's spirits, for that they
are not ascertained whereunto all our motions tend, and in what they will
center,

Though, we conceive, they may have received some general satisfaction from
what we have formerly at several times propounded; yet since they were not
disposed into such a form and condition as to become practicable; we have, with
the best care and abilities God has afforded us, cast the same into a Model
and Platform, which we shall speedily present unto the view and consideration
of all, as the Standard and ultimate scope of our Designs, that so (in ease of
approvall) it may be subscribed and returned as agreed upon by the People. And
thus far, we conceive, we may without offense or prejudice to Authority,
proceed; and which we the rather do, because we know no better, and indeed no
other way or means (but by such an Agreement) to remove (as much as may be) all
disgusts and heart-burnings, and to settle the Commonwealth upon the fairest
probabilities of a lasting Peace, and contentfull Establishment.

The Agreement of the People which was presented by his Excellency and the
Officers of the Army to the Right Honorable the Commons in Parliament,
although in many things short (according to our apprehensions) of what is
necessary for the good of the Commonwealth, and satisfaction of the People;
particularly, in that it contains no provision for the certain removal of
notorious and generally complained of grievances: And although it has some
things of much hazard to the Public, -- yet, had it been put in execution, we
should scarcely have interrupted the proceedings thereof, since therein is
contained many things of great and important concernment to the Commonwealth.
But seeing the time proposed therein for reducing the same into practice, is
now past, and that likewise the generality of the people have not, or do not
approve of the same, for the reasons (as we suppose) forementioned: We have
thought fit to revise it, making only such alterations therein as we conceive
really necessary for the welfare, security and safety of the People, together
with additionall Provisions for the taking away of those Burdens and Grievances
which may without real prejudice to the Management of public Affairs be
removed.

And because it is essential to the nature of such an Agreement to take its
rise from the People, we have therefore purposely declined the presentment
thereof to the Parliament: and conceive it may speedily proceed to
Subscription, and so to further practice, without any interruption to this
Representative, until the season prefixed in the Agreement, for the assembling
another: By whose immediate succession, without any intervall, the Affairs of
the Commonwealth may suffer no stop or intermission.

Lastly, We conceive we are much mistaken to being judged impatient, and
over-violent in our motions for the public Good. To which we answer, That
could we have had any assurance that what is desired should have otherwise, or
by any have been done; and had not had some taste of the relinquishment of many
good things that were promised, we should not have been so earnest and urgent
for the doing thereof.

Though we know likewise it has been very customary in such heretofore as
never intended any freedom to the Nation, to except only against the season,
and to protract the time so long, till they became sufficiently empowered to
justify the total denial and refusal thereof. However, the main reason of
our proceeding as we do, is, because we prefer the way of a settlement by an
Agreement of the People before any other whatsoever.

And thus the world may clearly see what we are, and what we aim at: We are
altogether ignorant, and do from our hearts abominate all designs and
contrivances of dangerous consequence which we are said (but God knows,
untruly) to be laboring withal. Peace and Freedom is our Design; by War we
were never gainers, nor ever wish to be; and under bondage we have been
hitherto sufferers. We desire however, that what is past may be forgotten,
provided the Common wealth may have amends made it for the time to come. And
this from our soul we desire.

Having no men's persons in ha^red, and judging it needful that all other
respects whatsoever are to give way to the good of the Commonwealth, and this
is the very truth and inside of our hearts.

From the Tower, April 14. 1649. John Lilburne William Walwyn Thomas Prince
