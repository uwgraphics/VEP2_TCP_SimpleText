A Voice of Comfort Sounded forth, and sent into the World To all the MOURNERS
IN ZION, Who are born of the Birth Immortal: WHEREIN Is declared the Purpose of
the Living God, Concerning the Righteous and the Wicked.

A Voice of Comfort sounded forth, etc.
Friends,
WHO are the beloved of the Lord, (who are called by scorners Quakers) you the
Lord has blessed and often visited, and has called you out of darkness and
has brought many of you out of Captivity from under Satan's power to
experience his goodness in the Light and Life of his Son Christ Jesus; and
since the day of his first Visitation and turning of us unto himself, he has
never left us, though he has suffered many to be deeply tried, some by
stripings, bruisings, woundings, imprisonments, banishment, and death, and in
all these things he has been a God nigh at hand, to bear up and support the
weakest child that he has called to bear testimony to his name; in the six
troubles he has not left them, nor in the seventh he will not fail: Oh you
dear and precious Sons and Daughters of Zion, your birth is from Eternity, and
your strength is from the mighty one who is the Being of Beings, who does
whatsoever pleases him; Oh my heart is in love with you, and my life dwells
among you, and as concerning ye, my heart has been ponderous with my God, and
my spirit has cried, wherewithal shall Jacob be raised up, and Zions Mourners
be comforted, and this has been answered in my heart from the Lord in the
feeling of his love, and of his dreadful Presence, saying, Fear not oh Daughter
of Zion since the day of thy birth and nativity I have borne thee up and
nourished thee as a little Child, and led thee as a tender one, and my eye of
pity has been upon thee, and I have entered into Covenant with thee, and I am
God that never changes, and I will never leave thee nor forsake thee.

And this further is the purpose of the Lord concerning thee oh thou afflicted
one, and disconsolated Child, who art ready to say within thy self why does the
Lord take away the righteous with the wicked, and remove the Innocent from the
Earth in this Contagion, and take away some of the faithful People, who have
put their whole trust in him, and have chosen the Lord to be their God, and
that have no hope nor expectation of comfort but only from the Lord; and
because of this I and many a weak one are shaken in our minds, because we see
the wicked boast and rejoice at the death of the Righteous, and holy people of
the Lord; who triumph and say, the Lord is angry with them, for he cuts them
off as he does the wicked; and this grieveth me most of all because they lift
up their voice now and cry where is now your God? Oh thou tender and afflicted
one, be not cast down in thy mind, neither let thy heart be troubled, nor thy
spirit within thee grieved, who have believed and received with joyfulness the
appearance of Gods grace, and have been led thereby out of the ways of the
wicked into the way where the righteous walk, and meet with comfort and
Heavenly refreshments from the Lord of Life. Oh fear thou not thou tender one,
for there is nothing shall befall thee but what is common to men, for the Lord
has made the World all of one Blood, and of flesh which is as grass which must
die, and our bodies are mortal as well as others, but our life by which we live
to the Lord is eternal, which life is more and more revealed to all that are
begotten and born of the Immortal seed; but our life is hid with Christ in God
from all who are in the first nature and know nothing of the Lord but what they
know naturally, not being born again, nor crucified to the evils of this World
by the power of Gods endless life; these knows not the end of the Righteous,
neither discerns the things of God, yet let the Righteous know, and the upright
consider that in all ages the Lord has tried his dearest Servants, and has
weaned them from all Creature-enjoyments, and has stripped them naked that he
might cloth them with that Garment that never waxes old, and feed them with
that bread which nourishes to Eternity. Oh how did he try righteous Abraham,
by requiring of him to offer up Isaac, but his reward was known in the end: And
how did he try Jacob with the parting from Benjamin, but Joseph was found
thereby: And how did he try Job with afflictions many ways, unto whom dreadful
tidings was brought, who said, the Lord gives, and the Lord takes away, and
blessed be his most holy name; And how did he try David, Daniel, and Jonah, and
delivered them in the day of their distress, and was their comfort in the day
of affliction, and a covert for them in the day of Calamity.

Thus the Lord has dealt with the faithful Prophets, Christ and the Apostles,
and the wicked said as at this day they do to Gods people, because God is
executing his determinate will, for it was said to Jesus, if thou be the Christ
come down from the Cross, and save thy self and us; but he was obedient unto
the death; and his Apostles they traveled in the way of the Lord, and lived so
that they might finish their course with joy, they were beloved of the Lord,
yet he suffered them to be tried, and to be tribulated, and the messenger of
Satan they knew, a thorn in the flesh they witnessed, but he that prevails
with God prayed that their Faith might not fail.

Thus did the Righteous in all ages; hear the rod and him that had appointed
it, and learned obedience by the things that they suffered, and by the
chastisement of the Lord they were drawn nearer unto him, even as those people
in the days of old, who said, other Lords has had D^minion over us, but now
we will make mention of thy name, for thou art the Lord our God, and the
Prophet said, though thou kill me yet will I trust in thee; and said, though I
go to the bottom of the Mountains there will thou find me; the Rocks nor Hills
cannot hide me, neither can the strength of Men nor Horses deliver me;
therefore will I remember the years of the right hand of the most High, and
while I have breath will praise his Name.

But oh says the afflicted one! I have often tasted of the mercies of the
Lord, and his goodness from day to day I have enjoyed since the time I received
in his righteous Judgments against the Man of Sin, which was revealed by the
brightness of the light of Christ Jesus, that did shine in my heart, in an
acceptable time, it was a day of comfort, and since I have had hours of
refreshment from the Lord by which I have been established: but that now the
Lord should take me and mine out of this World, this sometimes proves an
exercise to my mind and a grief unto my heart, and the more because the wicked
boast themselves against God thereby: Oh thou tender one be not at this cast
down, for the Lord has born long, but now is risen as a Lion out of a thicket,
he has taken notice how the wicked has oppressed the Righteous, and made a
spoil of the upright in heart; and how they have determined to banish them
into far Countries, and to force them into vacant Islands, but they shall not
have their end, for many shall dye in their own land, for now the Lord has
sent the destroying Angel forth, and has given him Commission to reap the
Earth, for the Lord himself will make the decission, and the wheat he will
gather into his garner, but the chafe, and the tears, he will burn with
unquenchable fire, and though the righteous dye, they die in the Lord, and shall
awake unto everlasting life; but the wicked to shame and everlasting contempt:
And they that be wise said Daniel shall shine as the brightness of the
Firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the Stars for ever and
ever, for the Lord is judge himself who forsakes not his Saints, they are
preserved for ever, but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off, who watches
to slay the righteous; but the Lord will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn
him when he is judged.

But they that have remembered their Creator in the days of their youth, and
have remembered and considered their latter end, and have known the Spirit of
the Lord to teach them to number their days, and that has applied their
hearts to wisdom, these shall rest from their labors, and be blessed, who
dye in the Lord, and shall live with him for evermore; therefore none be
troubled who have believed the report of truth, and have known the arm of the
Lord revealed, and in the patient Spirit dwells; And with old Ely, say it it is
the Lord, let him do what he will: for all thy thoughts, and cares will but
trouble thee, and be a means to remove thee from thy rest, and to draw thee
from thy habitation.

Oh let these thy Trials, and Tribulations have this effect in thy heart, that
thou thereby may have patience and experience the Lords goodness every day; for
assuredly all things shall work together for the good of them that fear and
love the Lord; if all things be then the death of his Saints, and Servants,
whose Names are written in the Lambs book of Life; who have delighted to follow
him through the Regeneration; but the wicked will the Lord Plague in the
furnace of his Fury, whose portion is appointed in the Lake prepared for the
Devil and his Angels: But he will say to the Righteous who delights to do his
will on Earth, Come ye blessed receive the Kingdom prepared for you; And to
the wicked who has delighted in wickedness upon the face of the Earth, these
are on the left hand Cursed, and are to go into everlasting Torments for
evermore; but Gods Covenant stands sure with the Righteous, and cannot be
Altered, because the Lord never changes, therefore are his People not Consumed
by their many Enemies in the World: But further says the tender hearted Child
of God, I have a weight and burden upon my heart to see Gods Judgments and his
vials powering forth upon the Earth, and the Sea, and yet few lays it to
heart, many there be indeed that mourn because of their sorrow, yet they
depart not from their sin, neither turn from their Transgressions, which have
been the very cause of Gods heavy Judgments: many are leight, and wanton, and
live in pleasure, (far from the state of the people of Ninevy, who humbled
themselves from the Highest to the Lowest) And had not I known something of the
goodness of the Lord, I should Judge their state better then mine: Oh therefore
consider thou afflicted one that this was the state of David in the days of
old, who saw the wicked in prosperity, and they had no bonds in their death;
and their eyes stood out with fatness, they had more then heart could wish; but
when he entered into the Sanctuary of the Lord, he considered their end;
although he thought in time he had washed his hands in innocence, because he
was poor, and needy, and his heart was wounded within him, he said, I depart
like a shadow that declineth, and am shaken off as the Grasshopper, my knees
are weak through fasting, and my flesh has lost all fatness, I became a rebuke
unto many; they that looked upon me shaked their heads, yet for all this will
I give thanks unto the Lord greatly with my mouth, and praise him among the
multitude; for he will stand at the right hand of the poor to save him from
them that would condemn his Soul.

And further says the poor broaken hearted one, saying here is a cry with the
ungodly, as dies the wicked so dies the righteous, and both have one event,
It Is true the natural bodies of both dye, yet there is a great difference
between the death of the righeteous, and the death of the wicked, for Balaam
said, Oh that he might dye the death of the righteous, and that his latter end
might be like unto his: for he saw there was goodly dwelling in the tents of
Jacob, and that the end of those that abode therein would be precious; because
the Righteous who have minded to follow the Lord in his Righteous Judgments, in
which, holiness and purity they have learned; but the wicked have run from the
Lord into wickedness; and have done dispight to the Spirit of Grace, and has
loved pleasures more then the Lord; and have said as those wicked ones in the
days of old to Jesus the Lord of Life, Get thee out of our Coasts, and as for
the Lord, we desire not the knowledge of his ways, and for these (...) this
day, and at all times, it will be a fearful thing to fall into the hands of
the living God; for there is no peace to the wicked says the Spirit of the
Almighty, but the fruit of Righteousness is peace to them that walk
righteously, and the effect is quietness for evermore, this by the Spirit of
the Lord is true and shall stand for ever: Therefore thou Child of the living
God feel the power of the endless life, to keep the heart in awe before the
Lord out of the Reasonings, and Consullings, about those things that may be
seen with the natural eye; for the saving Power and Comforts of God is only to
be witnessed within, by a sinking down into the measure of Christ manifest in
thy mortal flesh, then thou will know the Lords Christ to rule in thy heart who
brings glad tidings, and publishes peace, and brings Solvation, and says in
the Daughter of Zion thy God Reigns; this was he that SIMEON waited for, it
being revealed unto him, that he should not taste death till he had seen the
Lords Christ; And when this was accomplished he said now let thy servant depart
in peace according to thy word, for my eyes has seen thy Salvation.

So thou that have had that Spiritual eye oppened whereby thou have seen, and
tasted of the good word of God; look not out at the works which the Lord is
working in the Earth; and the desolation that he is making among the Sons of
men, (but remember Dinah who went out, and came in ravished) so keep close in
the pure seed of life, in which thou will see all things possible with the
Lord; and by his own works he will be glorified, and by his power and judgments
he will be known to all Nations. So blessed art thou that lies down in the
Kingdom and Patience of Jesus. The Grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you,
and his Peace rest upon you for ever-more.
