Know thy self.
MAn's curious Nature still contends to know
What Is acting in the heavens, what is done below;
He Will number Stars; unfold what is to come;
Fathom the Seas, bring sand into a sum.
He will maintain he knows the year, the day
Wherein this glorious Fabric shall decay.
He Will quere his Creator, and reply
His own Inventions, his own vanity:
Poor man look back, look on thy self, that Book
Will teach enough; man should no further look
Till that be thoroughly learned, It Is such a task
The learning of it many an age will ask.
Study thy self, and all thou can is study,
For all thy actions are but dull and muddy;
Leave off vain questions, meddle not at all
With heavens decrees, it is diabolical:
First know thy self, then shall thou know the power
That gave this Knowledge, it is the strongest Tower
Man can repair to; This being truly known,
Makes man entitled man, and all his own.
But oh Ambition, how it fools the sense
Of worm-like man! and hurries reason thence.
How great an influence has vainglory got
On weak, weak man whom it does thus besot.
These actings are men's own, and these intrusions
Of fame hereafter, are but mere delusions.
Oh give me moderation, let me live
No longer than I shall forbear to grieve
My Christian and my Natural brethren so!
As to condemn their Zeal, or urge their woe*
God is a God of order, Man below
Should not confound, nor seek Man's overthrow;
I Will neither envy Man, nor censure pass,
How God shall deal hereaster, for alas!
Man cannot Know himself, how can he then
Presume to Know, what God shall act, or when?
Or how, or where, or by what means, or why?
He that pretends to this presumes too high.
These are to be given away by the Author, at the Sarazens-head within Ald-gate.
