THE EPISTLE TO LONDON DROLLERY.
Reader,
THe other Drolleries going so swift away,
Why should I think that this should make a stay;
For this by several Critics has been scanned,
And Stationer to, before he would take it in hand;
And being well approved before it came to the Press,
I cannot think that it will have a less
Esteem abroad then any of the rest,
Because it has endured so severe a test.
Suspend thy Censure till thou'st fully seen't,
I do not doubt but thou wilt find something in it
Will please thy Pallet: Is thy mind Jocose,
Here Is that will please, unless you are too Morose:
(...) And being suited to all humors so,
'Nought but but Impartiality can have a low
Esteem for it; The envious I value not,
For they in Peccadillo things will be so hot,
And wreak their spite on any, though unknown,
And all forsooth because it is not their own.
If ought do please thee, then I Am well apaid,
For all these things unto that end was made:
If not, then leave it, it is all one to Will,
I was VV. H. and so shall be still.
Dated on May Day when so loud it Thundered, Anno Seventy three and Sixteen
hundred.
LONDON DROLLERY.
A New Song.
TOo fair and unkind, when I did discover
Those charms, to which all that see you submit.
Your languishing eyes first made me a lover,
And then you that Empire kept by your wit;
For you, the soft fetters of Phillis I broke
To put on a Lass! a more rigorous yoke,
Poor Phillis was kind her slave to preserve,
You doom me to wait, and force me to starve.
2.
Away with Devotion which makes you uneasy,
And with you good humor so ill does agree,
Faith try but the pleasure, and when Zeal would seize ye,
You Will find the fit better employed upon me:
For Love the dull Cloister as highly exceeds
As numbering of hearts does dropping of Beads;
And Saints like to Iris are never Divine,
Till Mortals are suffered to kneel at their shrine.
A New Song.
1.
LOng betwixt love and fear Phillis tormented,
Shunned her own wish, yet at last she consented
But loath the day should her blushes discover.
Come gentle night she said,
Come quickly to my aid,
And a poor shameface Maid,
Hide from her Lover.
2.
Now cold as I see, I am now hot as fire,
I dare not tell my self mine own desire,
But let day fly away, and bid night have her.
Grant ye kind Powers above,
Slow hours of parting love,
But when to Bliss we move,
Let 'em fly faster.
3.
How sweet it is to Love, when I discover
That fire which burns my Soul, warming my lover,
It Is pity Love so true, should be mistaken,
If that then he might be
False or unkind to me,
Let me die e're I see
That I am forsaken.
A New Song.
1.
TAke heed fair Clelia how you tame
With your disdain Dorastus fame,
A noble heart when once denied,
Swells into such a height of pride.
Twill rather burst, then dain to be
A worshipper of Cruelty.
2.
You may use common Lovers so,
My Sighs at last to Storms will grow,
And blow such scorn upon this Pride,
Will blast all I have magnified.
You are not fair when Love you lack,
Ingratitude makes all things black.
3.
O do not for a flock of Sheep,
And golden showers when as you sleep;
Nor cause Ambition often swells,
Forsake the place where honor dwells.
In Damons Palace you will never shine
So bright as in those Arms of mine.
A New Song in the Fatal Jealousy.
1.
I Languish all Night, and sigh all the Day,
And much to be pitied I am,
Ere since your bright eyes
My heart did surprise,
I could not exstinguish the flame:
But since you have known
My heart was your own,
Who before was so kind, now scornfuller grown:
If so cruel you prove,
To the man that you love,
Ah Phillis, Ah Phillis, what Fate
Alas is reserved for the man that you hate.
The Devout Drunkard, being a Mock to, O Love if e're thoult ease a heart; And
to that Tune.
1.
O Bacchus if thoult ease a Soul
That owns thy Juicy power,
And bleeds for that high chirping bowl,
For which mine eyes never ceasing roll
Until I see that hour.
Under the Tun, I fainting waste
A thousand times I wish to taste;
But when I see such halting haste,
To ease me of my thirsty pain,
I bleed with grief in every vein.
2.
But thus as I sat all alone,
In The deep and shady vault,
Continuing still in grief and moan,
A neighboring drawer then came down
Which was the man in fault.
O how I strove the Rogue to chide,
He blushed and strived his fault to hide,
And swore the tatling Echo lied.
And prayed my Passion then forbear
Least it should come to's Masters ear.
But Bacchus yet I Would die to gain
But one poor parting Cup,
Although it lately filled my Brain,
Impose on me all racks of pain
If soon I drink't not up.
Thus are poor Mortals often abused,
Who long God- Bacchus trade have used,
Cause drawers often have refused:
When we do burn with thirsty flame,
To give us that would quench the same.
The Dutch Insolence the occasion of the War with them, ending with an Elegy on
Mr. Boil.
WHen the Dutch States with Insolence were grown
So monstrous big, they scarce had room for one,
They sought about for more, yet naught could please
But the Dominion of the British Seas:
In order unto which, they load the main
With Men of War, and all the world disdain,
Their Sails being filled with what themselves are full
They under Sail did then attempt to pull
The power into their own hands, from her that nursed
Them up; they did attempt, but in the attempt they burst:
For when calm Albion's King a while had viewed
The monstrous preparations of this rude
Ignoble people, strait he lanched forth
A mighty Navy, mighty for its worth,
But for its Conduct more; being led by him
Whose glorious Actions might the Caesar's dim,
Illustrious James it was, whose powerful Arm
The Dutch felt burning hot, when he scarce warm:
And amongst the Noble train did wait upon
His Royal Highness, noble Boil was one:
A noble youth, who in his Aspect bore
The Characters of good, and great in store:
His person built to such a height and due
Proportion, as any thing that is true:
And with his person, such his actions were
That every move was pleasing, every move did dare
To something great: yet with such modest mean,
He was admired, and loved as soon as seen;
And though the unequal of his body wore
This taking Aspect, yet within was more:
For there a genious sat, so strung, that strait
To what you touched, if what you touched had weight:
Above her great reason sat, which did control
The expanding vigor of his mighty Soul:
Which like a fermentation else had broke,
The pollish'd cask, before this fatal stroke:
True courage now it was, upon whose wings
He clim'd the Tragic stage, and dared such things
That Mars himself no sooner saw, but sent
In fire and smoke, to him a Complemement:
But spightful Death, who in an ambush lay,
In this great Tragedy to choose his prey:
Had hid himself within that Cloud of Smoke,
That Mars had sent, and gave that fatal stroke
By which he fell, yet honorably died
In's Countries Service, by his Princes side:
His Soul then being fled, to whom 'twas due,
A contest here then about his body grew;
The Earth claimed it as hers, and had prepared
In her own bowels to have it there interred;
But Neptune greedy of so great a prize,
Did bounce and foam, and at the Deck did rise
To demand his Dead, at which the tall
Ship bowed her lofty Head, and Sails and all,
For nothing else could Neptunes wrath appease
But that same body, to adorn his Seas,
At which the Marble wept, and does weep yet,
Cause that his Name's not in her Forehead writ.
On the Death of the Earl of Sandwich.
IS Sandwich dead? Is that brave Hero gone
Of Englands Architect, the corner Stone.
Did he not think his dearest blood to dear
To spend for us? and we deny a tear:
Let Us give him that, which we cannot deny
To an expiring Valiant Enemy.
Let Us drain our eyes, and make him float again
In our Salt tears, as once upon the Main.
Let every one give honor to his Hearse,
And every Poet cast on it a Verse.
But O brave Sandwich, whose Pen must that be,
That on thy Death can write an Elegy;
Thou dy'st not like a Mortal; and if so,
What Mortals Pen to write thy Death does know.
The Obsequious Lover, A SONG.
1.
When I contemplate on thy parts
My dear Corrinna, I despair,
Because you are Mistress of all hearts,
And all expect to have a share
2.
How then can I expect to find
So much as one good look from thee,
Since all that know thee are so kind
Thy Votaries they Vow to be.
3.
One for thy Voice admires thee much,
Another for thy Dancing to,
But if a Lute thou chance to touch
They stand amazed, and cannot go.
4.
A third admires thy sparkling eyes
That shine like Diamonds in the night,
A fourth does praise thy lips likewise,
Being of a Ruby color right.
5.
A fifth sets forth thy ruddy cheek
As being of so pure a hue,
That when for Roses they do seek,
There they are found, as if there they grew.
6.
A sixth admires thy Swan-like skin,
A seventh does praise thy foot and hand,
Another so thy neck and chin,
A ninth thy waste which may be span'd.
7.
A tenth thy hair and other parts
To share 'em all they do agree,
On which they all do fix their hearts,
But yet I hope thy heart is free.
8.
Grant me but that Corrinna then,
It Is only that which I do crave,
I shall be happiest of all men,
If I may live and die thy Slave.
The Prologue to Arvicagus and Felicia.
YOu are Trapand: Invited to a Play
Which e're half done, you will with your selves away.
It Is long, it is sad: nay you must mark the Plot,
Then Court not Vizard Masks, or Censure not:
Some think if they had known as much before,
They would have made Abatement at the door:
We'll do it yet; but now I think I Will stay,
For he that took your mony's gone away:
Something would yet be done, e're we begin,
Well to an old Play, you have a new Prologue in,
That Is more then promised; What if both be ill,
Where are we then, we are your debtors still:
To quit scores, take full liberty to day
To Censure loud the Actors and the Play:
But at another time when the Play is good,
Sit Silent, that we may be understood.
Your Pardons Gentlemen, alas it is not we
That dare Impose: though Poets saucy be,
For we confess it is very just and fit,
When they show none, you should Proclaim your wit,
Take your full License as you used to do,
But find just faults, or else they will censure you.
On a Shrew.
SShrew being blamed, because she showed
Not so much Reverence as by right she owed
Unto her Husband: She replied she might,
Forbear then complaint of me, I do him right,
His will is mine, he would bear Rule, and I
Desire the same only by Sympathy.
The Prologue to the Widow.
NOw that the Season of the War is past,
We well had hoped to see you here at last,
But you this Winter find out other ways
To kill your selves, and to destroy our Plays,
You meet in Masquerade to pass your time
Without the help of Reason or of Rhyme,
You talk, and cheat each other in disguise,
And draw ten blanks of Beauty for one prize
Were Visor of, and all were bound to come,
And show your homely Faces in the Room,
Each one would cry to see the rest appear,
Now what the Devilish do these damned faces here.
Then he who seemed a Lord in that dumb show,
Prove some young Spark of Paternoster Row.
And she who in disguise appeared so pretty,
Turns up her Masque and shows the Orange Betty.
Thus tired with want of pleasure home we creep,
And all next day, you lie a Bed and sleep,
Mean time our empty Seats, your absence mourn,
We sigh (but Poets think of you with scorn)
For Courting still your selves, you seem to say,
That you Heaven Love, you have more wit then they,
And that one Sceen of the Couch, is worth a Play.
The Epilogue to the Widow.
THe Stage is like a Gaming-house, where you
Still throw at all, we bring more old then new
And you of late have so succesful bin,
That to our cost, what e're we set, you win
But now we so much cunning understand
To loose but little, and to starve your hand,
We butter not, but take the safest way
To set you a small sum, a poor old Play
If you are kind, throw out for this one stake,
For faith it is all we can at present make
The Poets and the Players now are poor,
But in our next new house, we will set you more.
A Song in the Dutch Lovers.
1.
A Myntas led me to a Grove
Where all the Trees did shade us;
The Sun it self, though it had strove,
It could not have betrayed us.
The place secured from humane Eyes,
No other fear allows,
But when the Winds that gently rise,
Do kill the yielding Boughs.
2.
Down there we sat upon the Moss,
And did begin to play
A thousand wanton tricks, to pass
The heat of all the day.
A many Kisses he did give,
And I received the same,
Which made me willing to receive
That which I dare not name.
3.
His Charming Eyes no aid required
To tell their Amorous Tale;
On her that was already fired,
'Twas easy to prevail.
He did but kiss, and clasp me round,
Whilst those his thoughts expressed,
And laid me softly on the ground:
O who can guess the rest!
And there I took my rest.
The second Song in the Dutch Lovers.
1.
AH false Amyntas! can that hour
So soon forgotten be,
When first I yielded up my power
To be betrayed by thee?
Heaven knows with how much Innocence
I did my heart resign
Unto thy faithless Eloquence,
And gave thee what was mine.
2.
I had not one reserve in store,
But at thy Feet I laid
Those Arms which conquered heretofore,
Though now thy Trophies made.
Thy Eyes in silence told their Tale
Of Love in such a way,
That 'twas as easy to prevail,
As after to betray
When only one does guide the Ship,
That neither Card nor Compass knows,
The Master, Pilot, Men asleep,
The stately Ship is split on shoals.
But when they wake, they start, and tare, and cry,
Who Is in the fault? Nor I, nor I, nor I.
Even so it fares with a High and Mighty State,
Not guided by the Master, but the Mate.
The Disconsolate Girl for the loss of her Love, lately Pressed to Sea.
The Tune, Bory Versaile.
1.
AS I was sitting on the Grass
Within a silent shady Grove,
I overheard a Countrey-Lass,
Was there bewailing of her Love.
My Love, says she,
Is taken from me,
And to the Wars is pressed and gone;
He Is marched away,
And gone to Sea,
Alack, alack and welladay,
And left me here alone.
2.
My Love he was the kindest man,
There Is none that is like him in the Town,
He Would gently take me by the hand,
And give me many a brave green Gown.
With kisses sweet
He would me greet,
And often sing a roundelay;
And sometimes smile,
Then chat a while,
That so we might the time beguile,
A live-long Summers day.
3.
My Love on May Day still would be
The earliest up of all the rest,
With Scarffs and Ribbons then would he
Of all the Crew be finest dressed;
With Morris-Bells,
And fine things else:
But when the Piper 'gan to play,
He danced so well,
I heard 'em tell,
That he did all the rest excel,
And bore the Bell away.
4.
The Man that took my Love away,
Was too too harsh, and too severe,
I gently on my Knees did pray
That he my Love would then forbear.
I offered too
A breeding Ewe,
And eke a Lamb that was my own:
Do what I could,
It did no good,
But left me in this pensive mood
To sigh and make my moan.
5.
I now will pray the Wars may cease,
That I again may see my Love;
And that the Bullets may him miss,
I will entreat the Powers above;
Which if they grant,
I then will chant
Abroad their Praises every day;
And with my charms
Secure from harms
My dearest Love within mine Arms,
And leave off Welladay.
A Song in Praise of Drinking.
Tune, Mr. Smith 's Jig, called Mris. Madge 's Jig.
1.
COme take up your Cups, and leave off this
Prittle prattle, Boys,
Away with disputes, they are only
Fit for the Schools:
Then trole it about, and call for the
to other Pottle, Boys,
Who loves not the Juice of the Grape
Are counted but Fools.
For poring on Books will make a man
Dull and muddy too,
And often does fill the Brain with
Frenzy and pains;
But we with Canary, without any
Pain or study too,
Copernicus-like, can turn the World
Round with our Brains.
2.
A Couple I knew that were besotted
With Love of late,
And both to be free from Cupid's
Bands did desire;
The one did resolve to study, and
Make his Book his Mate,
The other by Bacchus resolved
To extinguish her Fire.
For he that by Study did think
To cast those thoughts away,
Did meet with a Subject still that
Did add to his Flame.
But the other by Drinking the thoughts
Of Love did so allay,
He had almost forgotten that ever
He had any Dame.
3.
Then off went their Hats, and off
Went all their studious thoughts,
And every one did praise the
Juice of the Vine.
And then unto Bacchus all did there
Confess their faults,
And vowed they would be daily offering
Unto his Shrine.
For Mars is mad, and Cupid's an
Ass, and Apollo too,
Who thinks by Fighting and Charms,
And Books to undo us,
But Bacchus shall be our Protector,
And him we will follow to;
Being under his Banner, what
Mischief can ever come to us.
The Courtiers Wooing a Country-Lass.
The Tune Johnsons Jig.
TEll me my Betty, why so nice and coy,
Remember the merry pastimes that we have had,
We might ere this a gotten a Lusty Boy,
A pox of a Jointure, I think thou wilt make me mad.
I Will settle upon thee kisses sweet and plenty,
From one unto two, and so from ten to twenty,
Nay more then that, I Will settle my self upon thee,
The finest covering yet thou ere had on thee.
2.
When that is done, I Will give thee a Silken gown
Shall trail behind thy feet a pretty space,
Of the modishest Silk that now is wore in Town,
And laid in every seam with Silver Lace;
Thy Petticoat shall be of Silk Prunellay,
Of The self same piece that was made for Arabella.
Thy Stockins of London Silk, well knit together,
And thy every days shoes shall be of Spanish leather.
3.
I Will take thee a house in any street in the Town,
Which thou shall pitch upon for thy delight,
And furnish some o'th Rooms with Beds of down
For thee and I to lie on every Night;
Thou also shall have a Chambermaid to attend thee,
Shall study to please thy humor and never offend thee.
And whenever thou shall call upon her,
She Will answer Madam, a purpose to give thee honor.
4.
Some days we will betake us to a Play,
And then we will Coach about to see our Friends,
And then another day, toth' Park away,
Or wheresoever still thy Fancy bends,
And so toth' Mulberry Garden we will have a fling to,
And then in St. James his Park we will see the King to,
Where many fine Gallants and Ladies walk for pleasure,
But thee alone shall still be my greatest treasure.
5.
If this will do, then let me know thy mind,
And give me but a kiss to Seal the same,
Thou shall have two for one, I Will be so kind
And pay it on thy Lips, from whence it came.
She then did fly into his arms to cheer him,
And wished no other harm might ere come near him.
As he was hers, so she was his for ever,
And naught but death, should ere their true Love sever.
On a Neat but Noble Cheese-feast lately in London.
To the Scotch Tune, Sit thee down by me.
1.
I Will tell you of a Treat in Throckmorton-street,
Where many good Friends of late there did meet,
Where diverse sorts of Cheese was so well dressed,
That I never yet saw such a Cows-bobby Feast.
2.
The first dish of Cheese that was then served in
Was three fat Pullats, with Bacon between
Laced round with Sprouts, that I Will swear at first sight,
I thought 'thad bin Bacon and Pullats downright.
3.
The next dish of Cheese that came to the board
Was a whole half-Lamb a dish for a Lord,
But I know 'twas Cheese, I Would a swore 'thad bin
The Baby of a Ewe, or very near a kin.
4.
The third dish of Cheese that was then brought up,
Was a Pie with Oysters, and Shrimps to the top
Mingled with Sweetmeats, but that I knew
'Twas Cheese, I Would thought 'thad bin a Pie to.
5.
The fourth dish of Cheese, though the other were clean,
Yet this all Foul, all Fat, none Lean,
As wild Ducks, Wood-cocks, and Larks, so well done,
You Would swear 'twere not Cheese, but foul every one.
6.
Now God to bless our good Benefactors both
That gave us such Cheese, first Boiled in broth,
The next Roast, then Baked, then Roast again to,
None tosted, as the Welchmen uses to do.
The Welchmans Wooing his Mistress.
To the Scotch Tune as above.
1.
SHinkin was tell Hur sorrowful tale,
Of Hur pright Pigsnie live in Wale;
How Hur was to Guenith a Wooing Ride,
With Hur prave Puckler and Swerd by hur side.
2.
First Hur was take Hur by the white hand,
And lead Hur over the Mountain land,
Which Hur Cousin Shinkin, ap Morgan, ap Shone,

3.
Then Hur was Sing Hur a Wisdom Song,

Then Hur was call for Welsh Harp, to try
To play fore Guenith Melodiously,
But Hur was greeve, cause Guenith was chide,
That Shinkin with Love was almost died.
5.
Then Hur was dance a Coranto to,

Last Hur was reckon hur Pettigree true,
From Shinkin, ap Thomas, ap Rees, ap Hugh,
But Guenith was cry, and from hur was flew,
So Hur was pid Cruel Guenith adieu.
The Innocent Girls Revenged.
A Song and true Story.
1.
JInny and Nelly together,
Did both of 'em fancy Will,
Yet Willy regarded neither,
But Courted his Molly still,
Yet Willy they say,
Did keep'm in Play,
And privately called 'em his dear,
And Jinny and Nelly,
The Truth to tell ye,
Did both of 'em make him good cheer
2.
To day would Willy to Jinny go,
O'th morrow with Nelly would be,
But neither o'th Girls did ever know
That he with both was so free;
For Jinny did think
She was at the brink
Of Marriage with Willy alone,
And Nelly likewise,
Did always surmise,
That she should have Willy or none.
3.
Jinny sometimes to Willy gave
A Favor, and Gloves, or Rings,
And Nelly would always ready have
The like, or some other things,
But what e're he got,
He kept not a jot,
But gave 'em to Molly at Night,
That Willy and Molly,
Did laugh at the folly
Of Jinny and Nelly outright.
4.
But Molly would still be prating,
As Women are use to do,
And spoke of the Lasses treating
Of Willy, and presents to,
And how he gave her
The Rings and Favors,
That they had presented to Willy,
And then by your Leaves,
They laughed in their sleeves
That Lasses should e're be so silly.
5.
But now I must tell you the knack on it,
To Jinny and Nelly 'twas known,
That Molly did use to crack on it
In several places in Town,
But Nell on her Breast,
Did see at a Feast
The Favor to Willy she gave,
And Jenny likewise,
On her finger espies
The Ring she would given to the Knave.
6.
Then Jinny and Nelly acquainted
Some friends of theirs that were come,
And told how their credits were tainted
By Will and Mall in the Room.
Then they by a Wile,
Did Willy beguile,
And got him into a yard by,
And so they mumpt him,
For soundly they pumpt him,
Until he for pardon did cry.
7.
Then Molly did kick and fling to,
And fumed like a furmety pot,
So from her they took the Ring to,
And what of theirs she had got,
Then out they pulled her,
And presently cooled her,
For under the Pump they placed her,
And when they had done,
They bid her go home,
And brag how much they had graced her.
A Song to the first Figure Dance at Mr. Young's Ball in Feb. 72.
1.
COme Lads and Lasses,
And hasten your paces,
For this is a merry Dancing day;
It Is May Day you know
And the Clock has struck Two
And now the Piper begins to play.
The May-Pole's seated,
And Bower's completed,
With Cakes and Ale attending,
And Cream and Cheese-cakes,
With Sider and Biskets,
And all of the Parishes sending.
2.
My Lord and Lady
Have long been ready,
And both of 'm decked as fine as may be,
So rich on my word
He looks like a Lord,
And she is as fine as a Bartlemew Baby.
She is dressed to day
So wonderful gay,
With that she has gotten together;
And likewise is he
As Gallant as she,
With his new fashion Hat and Feather.
3.
There Is John a the Mill to,
With Joan a the Hill to,
Have both been there an hour ago;
And Will of the ^ell to
With high dancing Nell to
And clad in their best Apparel to.
And George a the green,
Is there to be seen,
Together with cherry cheekt Hester;
And Betty and Richard,
With dainty fine Bridget
Who came with her capering Kester.
4.
Then for our-Town hey,
They every one cry,
And each did take his Lass by the hand;
And about they go
The Green too and fro,
And round the May Pole: then make a stand.
So the Piper then
Fell to it again,
And Sellenger's Round did Play 'um,
And to it they went,
They were all so bent,
The Devil a one could stay 'um.
5.
And so they continue
With all their Retinue,
Until they were tired with Dancing quite;
The Piper likewise,
Could scarce keep his eyes
Open, for playing from morn till night,
Then hey for the Ale
And Cakes they do call,
And down in the Bowers they set 'em,
And when they had done,
Then every one,
Away to their homes did get 'em.
A Song on the Morris at Mr. Youngs Ball,
And to that Tune.
SOme Pretty Ladies on a day,
Did go abroad a Maying,
And on the gentle grass they lay,
Till the Fiddler fell a Playing.
Then in a trice
They all did rise
With every one a Feather,
And hand in hand
They made a stand
Four and four together.
2.
Then every one began to meet,
And timed the Music truly,
And with their pretty nimble feet
Did keep their measures duly.
Then all came out,
And Danced about,
And fixed into a figure,
And so began
The Morris than
With pretty might and vigor.
3.
And first fair T. D. did begin,
Whose dancing scarce has fellow,
And Lovely S. B. followed in
Whose dress was comely yellow.
Then pretty Li
Tript out and in,
And footed it most neatly;
And witty Sin
did likewise with
The rest do all completely.
4.
Then strait-limb'd Gr. wheeled about
Her pretty La. to greet still
Who in no figure was out
But handsomely did meet still.
Then airy Ma
Got credits Badge,
By'r true and lofty measure;
She well did do,
And so did to
Pretty lively L -- r.
5.
Thus have you heard the Morris out,
Though none were so oath crew then
They prettily did turn about
And every one danced true then.
And at the last,
But not too fast,
They made their Honors neatly;
And who can say
That very day
But all was done completely?
On his Valentine.
IF I may claim my own, than you are mine
Throughout this year to be my Valentine;
But you perhaps may brand me with the Name
Of Impudent; but Madam, know the blame
Is not in me; for 'twas a chance of mine
That drew your self to be my Valentine:
Therefore if you will needs displeased be,
You must with chance be angry: not with me.
A Scotch Song.
1.
KIlt thy Coat Paggy,
Kilt it to thy knee,
Change thy mind dear hunny,
And gang along wi' me.
But Ise not kilt my Coat,
Nor Ise not change my boon;
Nor Ise not kiss no Lads
Tall Will cooms to Toone.
2.
Change thy mind sweet Paggy,
For Willy Leov's not thee;
To Leove, and not Leove again
Is a foolish fantasy:
I prathee sweet Leove be waise,
And well advised be,
And quickly kilt thy Coat
And gea alang with me.
3.
There Is nothing can withstand
A willing settled moind,
There Is neither Sea nor Land,
Shall make me stay behind;
But the steans that lie in Fields
My pillows needs must be,
But, O mine ean sweet Willy
Ise long to Ligg with thee.
A New Catch.
1.
HE that Marries a Girl that is fair,
If he be a Cuckold, he needs not despair,
He may be saved without a Prayer
For the sins of his Wife shall save him.
But he that Marries an ugly Whore,
And takes a Wench on another score,
May say his Prayers over and over,
But at length the Devil will have him.
The Old and Decrepit Beggars Wedding.
WHilom there was an Aged Beggar Old,
In his life full fourscore Winters told;
His Head all frozen, Beard long, white as snow,
With a staffs propp. uneath else might he go
With bleared eyne, all parched dry and cold
With shaking-Palsey, little could he hold:
His Clothes so tattered, for they were so worn,
Older than he, in many pieces torn;
The subtlest eye, and prying'st brain, those seen,
Both could not guess what stuff't had ever been:
On's Cloak more several patches there did stick,
That labored Algebras with all his Magic,
Could once tell how to number; and was fuller
Then was the Rainbow of each various color:
But not so fresh: so faden when they were seen,
That none could guess, which red, which blew, which green,
His Turf-house leaned to an old stump of Oak,
A hole a top there was to void the smoke:
Covered with stolen boughs, which could not be fed,
But by his daily begging, daily Bread:
There on a little bench I Will leave him then,
Within a while I Will speak of him again.
Another Begger-woman, a little sunder'd
From him, whom all the Town said was a hunderd:
Toothless she was, nay worn were all her gums,
And all her fingers too were worn to thumbs:
Wrinkles, deep graves to bury all delight,
Eyes new sunk holes; little she had of sight:
Little could speak, as little Sense could tell,
Seldom she heard, sometimes the great Town-bell.
A long forgetfulness her Legs had seized,
For many years her Crutches had them eased.
Cloths, thousand rags tore with the wind and weather,
Her House-wifry long since had sowed together.
No livelihood, but Charity grown cold,
As she was this, more than her years made old.
In a hot Summers day, they out did creep,
Inlivened just like flies, for else they sleep:
Creeping at last, each one to other get
Lowsing each other, kindly thus they met:
Apollo's Masterpiece shining did aim
To light dead ashes sparks: not make a flame.
To stir up Nature in 'em now so cold,
And whither Cupid dwells in them who are old?
Now heat and kindness made him try to kiss her,
Her palsied-head so shak'd he still did miss her:
He thought of modesty, she against her will
Striving to please him, could not hold it still:
She mumbled, but he could not understand her,
But cried sweet Hero, I Will be thy Leander:
She said before we met, cold as a stone is,
I was: but now am Venus, thou Adonis.
Such heights of passions, Love had brought these two,
As youngest Lovers, when they gin too woo:
For Cupids reign over Mankind still will have,
He governs from the Cradle to the Grave:
Their virtues such, not sin; yet would not tarry,
So heated, vowed a contract then to Marry:
This Marriage now divulged was every where
To Neighbor Beggars; Beggars far and near.
The day appointed, and the Marriage set,
The lame, the blind, the deaf, they all were met,
Such throngs of Beggars, Women, Children seen,
Mustered all on the Town's fair grassy green:
The Bridegroom led between two lame men so,
Because our Bridegroom fast he could not go:
The Bride was led by Blindmen, close behind,
Because you know that Love is always blind.
The Hedge-Priest then, which they did with them bring,
Married them both with an old Curtain Ring.
No Father there was found, or could be ever,
She was so old, that there was none to give her;
With acclamations now of louder joy,
Prayed Hymen Priapus to send a Boy
To show a miracle in vows most deep,
The Parish swore their Children all to keep.
Then Tom a Bedlam wound his horn: at best
Their Trumpet, now to bring away the Feast,
Picked Marrow-bones they would found lately in the street,
With Carrots, kicked out of Kennels with their feet:
Crusts gathered up, for biscuit 'twas so dried
As if it lain in Alms-Tubs long, and more beside:
Many such dishes had, but yet 'twould cumber,
Any to name them; more than I can number:
Then came the Banquet, that must never fail,
Which the Town gave; that is white-bread, and strong Ale;
Each was so Tipsie that they could not go,
And yet would dance, and cry for Music ho:
Grid-irons and Tongs, with Keys they played on to,
And blindmen sung to them, as used to do:
Some that were there, on hollow sticks did sound,
And so melodiously they played a round:
Lame men, lame Women, mingled cried advance,
And so all limping Jovially did Dance:
The Deaf men to, for they must not forbear,
When they saw this, although they could not hear:
Which was their happiness: now to the house
Of Bridegroom brought the Bride, each Drunk as Mouse.
No room for any but them two they saw,
So laid them down in Bed of fresher straw;
Then took their leaves, put out the rushy light,
But they themselves did revel all the night:
The Bridegroom busles now, kissed, and said friend,
But when he kissed, thought 'twas at the other end:
He cried her mercy, said he could not look
It was so dark, and thought he had mistook:
No said the Bride most sweetly then you are right,
As if our Taper here were burning bright:
They bust, and kissed, and bust again, and kissed,
And she though Palsy head, it seldom mist;
They both now filled with Ale, brains in it did steep
So Arms in Arms, our Lovers fell asleep:
So, for the will, though nothing else indeed
To Love, the Beggars built a Piramide.
The Epilogue to the Beggars Wedding.
TOth' Beggars Trade, I Have served 2 Prentiships,
For which I know I Have tasted several whips:
Give your advice, do you think I now am made
Free of the Beggars Company, and the Trade:
My mind in secret to your ear I speak,
Is such, as I am sure I shall not break,
Unless in passion, when no meat I get,
When Belly-timber wants, 'twill make one fret.
For otherwise, when abroad I lead my Scorta,
We each may say, Omnia mea, mecum porta,
And being Philosophers, there is none will scant
Their pittance to us, that we never shall want,
Then let Boreas burst his cheeks, anth' Sea roar,
The Beggars bark can never be tumbled o'r:
What fitter subject for my Muse can be,
Than make Descriptions of our company;
But being in have, and for some causes vexed
I Will cease: and happily may say more in the next.
For the Beggars theme too well my fortunes fit,
My Fancy's beggarly too, faith and so's my wit.
TWo Lords, 4 Knights, 3 Squires, and I the least,
My kind Friend Willy bids unto his feast,
Where was both fish, and flesh, and all such cates
Which men are wont to have, that feast great states,
To pay for which next day he sold his Nag,
Of whose swift pace, he used much to brag:
Well, I Will never care for red and fallow Deer,
If that a Horse so Cooked, make so good cheer.
A Song.
1.
It Is true fair Phillis, heretofore
I your Beauty did adore,
And gave my Captive heart a prize
To the conquest of your eyes.
2.
But since that you so cruel prove,
To reject my chastest love,
And do wound me by disdain,
Give me back my heart again.
3.
Although I Am sure I cannot be
Contented with my liberty;
I am resolved to submit
To good old Sack to cherrish it.
On his fair, but faithless Mistress.
GO perjured Wretch, women I Will court no more
Since Delia false does prove, who always swore
In true affection she would constant prove;
Yet now forgets mine, for another love:
Now every feature which appeared to me
So beautiful, is mere deformity;
Her face which heretofore Angels outride,
Is Leprous with her falsehood, and her pride:
Then since no constancy in Women can
Be found: I Will make my-Amours to a man.
A Song.
1.
I Dye, and yet I dare not speak
To her who does my passion move,
This thought alone my heart does break,
To know I dare not own my Love.
When ever I see her charming eyes,
I straight become her Sacrifice:
She Is fair, which makes me doubt she will prove
So cruel to reject my love.
2.
Upon this Altar of my heart
Love's pure, and chastest flames do burn,
When Love and Death shall act their part,
If she but look within my Urn.
Engraven on my heart, she will see
The Idea of her my Deity,
My Epitaph shall be my fate,
My Love made me unfortunate.
The Jealous Girl mistaken, in a Dialogue between Menalcas and Licoris.
1.
HEre, here, my fair Licoris,
Sit thee down thy wearied Limbs to rest,
Where drooping Violets so like thy self,
Have made for thee a Nest.
Grass for our Sheep here store is,
And a shade the Sun can never infest
As dark and gloomy, as the grief
Wherewith thou seem so sore oppressed.
Now let me know
The cause of thy dear Woe,
Whose precious Food
Is of thy Tears and Blood;
And for whose nourishment,
Thy self thou near have spent.
2.
Menalcas do thou ask it,
Need the root inquire what Fruit it bears;
Thou were the Spring of all my Joys
And Fountain Art of all my Tears.
Therefore do no more Mask it,
Pity Friend worse then true scorn appears,
I shortly shall be gone, and with me yours,
And your Faith Phillis fears.
It Is she False man,
Makes me so pale and wan,
So sorrow slain,
With that she wept amain,
And hung her gentle head
Like to a Lilly dead.
3.
With that the Shepherd moved
Both his eyes and hands to Heaven, he heaved
His spotless faith he vowed, and she
Alas unhappily deceav'd.
That he never Phillis Loved
More then ripe ears do love, the stormy wind,
But in Licoris all his hopers
Eternally should be confined.
Quoth she, fie, fie,
Add no more perjury,
I saw the Band
Of our true Loves on her hand.
The Ring I thee first gave
Saved thy life, and dig'd my grave.
4.
With that the Shepherd smiled
In his heart, glad that he could untie
With so much ease, the knot of poor
Licoris headless Jealousy.
My Life thou art beguiled
Quoth the Swain, with that the Ring pulled out
Yet seeming reason some there was
For this, thy but too loving doubt
For Corydon,
By thy Ring made her one
Like as the Lambs
Mistaken by their Dams;
But this is thine, and I
More for it till I die.
5.
Long sat the Girl ashamed,
'Till at last, about his Neck she stole
Her Arm, then Venus belt a better
Cord to hold a wavering Soul.
Her Jealousy she blamed,
In his breast she hid her bashful head,
And whispered to his heart, that if
He loved her not, she was but dead,
That no man ere
To her was half so dear,
His Pardon prayed,
Yet being sore afraid
To loose so sweet a friend,
Had almost wrought her end.
6.
Menalcas then embraced her,
Protesting that he loved her well before,
But now he vowed that naught but
Death should ever part 'em more.
Now he in's heart had placed her,
Cause she for love of him was brought so low,
There Is naught but too much love I find
Has wrought Licoris overthrow.
For Jealousy,
There Is no man can deny,
Though grown a weed,
But to come of noble seed.
And no where to be found
But in Loves richest ground.
On his Beautiful Mistress, To my M. B. quintescence of Beauty, I John Thump
does present my duty.
MY dearest Maudlin, dain me at this time,
Thy incomparable parts to blaze in modest rhyme,
That all hereafter which shall hear thy Story,
Will say that it is to thy Immortal glory:
O thou that able art to take to task all,
Pox, what will rhyme to that? I am a Rascal
If I know, it is no matter, but for thy credit
I Have penned a Poem; Prithee take it and read it,
Thou need'st not be ashamed often, for it raises
Trophies as high as Maypoles to thy praises:
And first in order, it thy head does handle,
That Is more obicular than a Quadrangle,
Of The top of which does grow a tuft of tresses,
Winter her self arrayed in her hoary dresses;
Nay a frost looks not more lovely, thy brows truly
Have larger furrows then a field plowed newly.
Thine eyes, hey eyes! I Am now so full of clinches!
Are not sunk into thy head, 'bove 16. Inches
From whence distilling, gently there does stream
Two Rivers of whey mixed with curded Cream.
Thy ears are like two pouches which do hang byth' side
Of a Brawny Ale-wife, when they are not tide.
Strait as a Ramshorn is thy Nose, more Marrow
Lies in thy Nostrils then will fill a Barrow;
And at thy lip, to make it Ornamental,
Hangs down a Jewel of Snot most Oriental,
The bright gold and thy hair is of one color,
But it compared with thee, that is the duller;
Thy lips are white as Tallow, never man did
Buss sweeter things, sure they are Sugar-candid;
And that in the Winter, she may be free from harm,
They Are thatcht with hair sweet Soul to keep her are,
Her Teeth more comely then two durty rakes
Her Breath is stronger then a dozen Jakes are.
A fig for all Perfumes, a fart for Roses,
Smelt men but thee, they would wish themselves all Noses,
Thy Voice is Musical, and sweet and fine is
As any Heg, or Hag, that ninety nine is,
And when thou talk, as if thou were the wonder
Of Women kind, thou art as still as Thunder;
And then for thickness 'bout thy lovely waste,
You Are larger then a Cow is when you are laced,
Thy Butt -- and the fashion are so all one,
That I Would a swore thou had a Fardingal on.
Thy Thighs are like two Posts that bear a Windmill up,
Whose Sails are turned by th'wind that comes from the top.
Thy Legs are Badger-like, and go as even
As do Iambick Verse, or splay-legg'd Steven.
And where she was born, that you may not be mista'en,
You Will find by her Legs her Birth was Crooked Lane.
And now I am come to thy Foot, where I do
Prostrate my self with reverence to thy Shoe;
Which for Antiquity never a jot behind is
Tom Coriats, that traveled both the Indies.
Thy Feet indeed, and I commend thee for it,
Are lovely thick, and excellently short:
She needs must dance well, I do long to see it,
She keeps her Toes out so, and her Heels do meet.
For thy sweet sake I will go down to Pluto,
And in thy quarrel beat him black and blew too;
And lest Sir Cerberus should be too lusty,
I have a Loaf will hold him play: it is crusty.
I Will have the Devilish back with me in a Snaffle,
For in that kind I scorn to have a baffle.
And so I take my leave, my dearest Pumkin,
And when I meet thee next, I Will kiss thy -- hand.
A Catch: By Wine, Ale, and Beer.
1.
Wine. I Jovial Wine exhilerate the heart.
Beer. March-Beer is Drink for a King.
Ale. But Ale, bonny Ale, with Spice and a Toast, In the Morning's a dainty
thing.
Chorus. Then let us be merry, wash sorrow away,
Wine, Beer and Ale shall be drunk to day.
2.
Wine. I Generous Wine am for the Court.
Beer. The City calls for Beer:
Ale. But Ale, bonny Ale, like a Lord of the Soil, In the Country shall
domineer.
Chorus. Then let us be merry, wash sorrow away,
Wine, Beer and Ale shall be drunk to day.
The Wretched Lover. A Song.
1.
SEE how I wretched Lover prostrate lie,
Bound in your Chains, and yet at liberty:
Striving the Ties which hold me to unfold;
They being tangled, me the straighter hold.
2.
The Beams shot from your Eyes do me inflame,
From thence I burn: O that you felt the same!
And whilst I struggle to evade the fire,
It still is blown up by my vain desire.
3.
I Am like a Ship which in a Storm is tossed,
Fearing on Rocks each moment to be lost:
It strives unto the Haven to attain,
But is by adverse Winds blown back again.
4.
Thus in Love's Labrinth do I run about,
And find no way by which I may get out.
Lend me the Clue; but if you that deny,
Then come your self, and stay eternally.
A Catch to Cupid.
IN vain, O mighty God of Love,
Thou shoot'st thy Arrows from above;
And with thy too imperious Dart
Do hit my Phillis frozen Heart:
For as a strong and well built Wall
Does back return the Tennis-Ball;
So does her Adamantine-Heart
Reverberate thy Fiery Dart.
On a Rhodomontade.
FOrtune, the Mother of Inconstancy,
Does pride her self that she may constant be
To me, whose Breath can whirl her Wheel about,
And with a look can put the Gods in doubt.
I with a word the Sun in's full carreer
Can stop, and the Heavens on my Shoulders bear.
I from fierce Thundering Jove can's Scepter take,
And with a frown can make Black Pluto quake.
I hopping Vulcan from his Fiery Cave
Can drag, and make him to become my Slave.
I with one single word int' Attoms can
Dispatiate, and turn the Stoutest Man
Into a Chaos: I the Universe
Can change, and the Decrees of Fate reverse.
To a Handsome Lady, being accounted Light; Exhorting her to change her Life.
MAdam, Whoever looks on your radiant Eyes,
Struck with the Beams, he falls, and prostrate lies:
And being deeply wounded with the Dart,
Straight for a Victim offers up his Heart:
But rising, he his Error soon does see;
Because your Form and Virtues disagree.
Your Beauty makes him ready to adore;
Your Vices to detest that which before
He honored so: So that you do create
At once a Subject for his Love and Hate.
Was but your Beauty decked with Chastity,
Then I should think you were some Deity.
But it is in vain to speak, I clearly see
That two such Gifts can in no Woman be:
Then now your self more than a Woman prove,
By being fair, to fly all dissolute Love.
On a Fisher that lost his Prey, his Angle breaking.
IN vain the Fisher strikes, and tries his Skill
Upon the foolish Fish, that he may kill;
But rather Arms with Craft the silly Fish,
To fly his Bait, and so avoid his Dish.
When being unexpert he does compose
His Angle slightly, and his Prey does lose.
A Song against a Single Mistress.
1.
FAin would I love my Delia two days more,
She kisses sweetly, and so nimbly stirred;
And he that loves his Mistress or a Whore
Above two days, let him be hanged the third.
Two days again is Physic; so long she
That Is after poison, may prove health to me.
2.
What did I say? Two days? I did repent
As of my doting and intemperate stay;
In shorter time my doting may be spent,
For Venus self it seems, tried but a day.
But she who this day may be true to me,
To morrow I may find in Bed with thee.
3.
It Is not the Number nor Plurality
That swells the sin, or greater makes the shame.
One as an hundred is Adultery,
Though change the Person, yet the sin's the same.
To kiss a hundred Whores is no more Crimes
Than it is to kiss one Whore a hundred times.
4.
Born under some ill Planet, or accursed,
Sure is that Man that loves one single Whore,
And with one drink does always quench his thirst,
And loves one single Mistress, and no more.
There Is no more Curse, nor other torments here,
Nor greater Plague, than love one Whore too dear.
On a Maid that died for Love, her Parents not giving Consent.
HE that would write an Epitaph for thee,
Must be a Lover, yet from Love be free.
If not a Lover, how can he express
In lively Lines the sum of thy distress.
And if in Love, then every word and verse
Does unto him his Destiny rehearse:
Then every stroke his nimble Pen does give,
Does wound his heart, and teach him how to live.
A Quill plucked from fierce Cupids Wing must be
His Pen, his Ink must come from Aganipe:
How can his Eyes be dry, when he does tell
That from thine Eyes great Showers have often fell.
A Song. In a Dialogue between Palemon and Corrinna.
1.
Pal. COrrinna, Prithee tell me why
That all do love, but thee and I:
Sure at our Birth it is very plain
Some inauspicious Star did reign.
2.
Cor. No, no, Palemon, you are the Cause;
It Is thou have broken Cupid's Laws:
His Laws did never force Women so,
To love Men whe'r they would or no.
3.
Pal. Is that a force, to cringe and pray,
And Treat you Nobly every day?
Had you at first not thought it meet,
Why did y' accept a second Treat?
4.
Cor. Fie, fie, Palemon; now y' are more
Mistaken, than you were before:
For it is not twenty Treats that can
Oblige us Women to love a Man.
5.
Pal. What is it then will make you love?
I Will fetched from Hell, or Heaven above.
Assist me now in this distress,
I Will own you for my Patroness.
6.
Cor. If Women love, it must be these
Particulars which follow, please:
First, He must be of proper size.
Which often does attract our Eyes.
7.
Then must he have a handsome face,
Good Mien, good Wit, and comely Grace.
Dance well, and have an excellent Voice:
These, these confirm us in our choice.
8.
Besides all these, he likewise must
Have that on which we both may trust,
A great Estate, with City and
Country House, both at Command.
9.
But faith of these you have but one,
That Is good Estate; 'twont do alone.
This my Advice does far excel
Those Treats of yours, and so farewell.
A Just, True, and Honorable Description of MARRIAGE.
OUt of stark love and kindness, and arrant devotion,
Of Marriage I Will give this galloping Notion:
It Is the bane of all Business, the end of all Pleasure,
The consumption of Youth, Wit, Virtue, and Treasure.
It Is the Rack of our Thoughts, the Nightmare of Sleep,
That calls us to work before the day peep.
That bids us make Brick without Stubble or Straw,
A Wife has no sense of Conscience or Law.
If you must be for flesh, take the way that is noble,
In a generous Wench there is nothing of trouble:
You kiss and you clip, stay, do what you please,
And the worst you can fear is but a Disease;
And Diseases, you know, may hope to be cured,
But the Torment of Marriage can never be endured.
On a Young Lady in Love with a Married Man.
ARise, fond Beauty, cast those thoughts away,
To love in vain, it is never the near, they say.
Your Gallant, who already married is,
Can make of You no other but a Miss.
Certainly, Madam, Cupid's very blind;
If not, to You I Am sure he proves unkind,
Which forces You to be in love with one
Who lets You sigh and languish all alone.
Madam, it troubles me both Night and Day,
That You should love so strangely out o'th way:
I do advise You, Lady, cease Your Suit,
And don't desire 't; You happily else may rue't.
I Have traveled many Kingdoms over and over,
Yet never heard of such a thing before.
The Face which heretofore did shine so bright,
And did abound with ravishing delight,
Is of a sudden both grown pale and wan,
And all forsooth is for a Married Man.
O Love! O Love! If ever thou wilt ease a Heart,
Free this poor Lady: let him feel the smart:
If not, make her to scorn his cruel Soul,
As much as he over her does now control:
And so for ever thou will counted be
A God of Justice and of Equity.
On his Beautiful Mistress.
1.
NOw guide my hand, you Gods that are above,
To blaze the Beauty of my harmless Dove,
With whom I am over head and ears in love.
2.
She is so beauteous, excellent and rare,
There Is none with her dares ever to compare;
She Is Beautie's Queen, and all her Subjects are.
3.
As for her Hair, it is a lightish brown,
Which, when unti'd, does to her Heels hang down.
Her Breasts as soft as any Thistle-down.
4.
Her Eyes as sparkling are as any fire,
Which darts into my Breast a fresh desire
To kiss her hand, and so a little higher.
5.
No Lilly can with her white hand compare,
Her other features all so curious are,
That looking on her, I die with despair.
6.
Her Waste it is so pretty and so small,
She is my Sweet, my Honey, Dove, my all:
And for her height, She Is moderately tall.
7.
And for her Humor, Gesture, and her Wit,
All in one Body so profoundly knit,
Her Equal no where has been found as yet.
8.
Her excellent Voice, when she is pleased to sing,
Sounds better far than the Nightingal in the Spring,
And with an Echo makes the Woods to ring.
9.
She Is Vertue't self, as all that know her know it.
Then you will ask me what need I turn Poet,
And strive with simple Poetry to show it?
10.
If my bad Verses any one offend,
Another Cup of Wine will make me mend
All I have said, but here I Will make an end.
A Song.
1.
IF thou will love me, I Will love thee again,
If my Griefs move thee, I Will love thy pain.
If thou disdain me, I Will die for woe;
And if thou fly me, I Will fly thee too.
For Love my Breast has filled with such a fire,
That whatsoever thou will, is my desire.
2.
If to be merry be pleasing to thee,
I Will leave off sadness, and merry be,
If Melancholy possess thy heart,
Then of that sadness I Will bear a part.
For Love my Breast has filled with such a fire,
That whatsoever thou will, is my desire.
3.
If thou love Music, I Will love it too;
If Courtship please thee, I Will learn to woo:
If Dancing like thee, I Will learn the same,
And unto that my mind I Will frame:
For Love my Breast has filled with such a fire,
That whatsoever thou will, is my desire.
4.
If thou would have me near thee still,
I always shall obey thy will:
Or if my presence sometimes be
Offensive, I will fly from thee:
For Love my Breast has filled with such a fire,
That whatsoever thou will, is my desire.
5.
If thou'st a mind a Miss to be,
Then I will be most true to thee:
Or if to Marriage you are inclined,
I quickly then will change my mind:
For Love my Breast has filled with such a Fire,
That to be cooled by thee is my desire.
On Captain Hicks his Curiosities of Nature: By a Young Lady.
NO Art to Nature can be equaliz'd;
When it is at best, it is but as Truth disguised:
As Shadows like it does but represent,
With all the Skill that Artists can invent.
Wonders of Nature can never be outdone,
Since they are framed by Providence alone.
Some things for Service, some to please the sight,
Their great Contrivance does create delight:
Yet to dull Fancies, most such things as these
Are not esteemed, and that is it cannot please.
So still it is Ignorance that denies 'em Worth,
Not able to discern or set them forth:
Such Rarities I much admire my self,
Since it is Earth, Air, and Waters greatest wealth.
I should detract from them, should I but praise
Heavens greatest Wonders, among which I number these.
Most Elements do grace this rare Collection,
Which Nature has brought forth to great Perfection:
And for your trouble, Sir, in gathering of 'em,
Ingenious Men will praise you, and those that love 'em.
Whose great Applause you justly do deserve,
Your time being spent Heavens Wonders to preserve.
More might be said, all with me will agree,
Only the great'st defect is in
E. C.

His Answer to Madam E. C. Upon her Curious Art in Cutting Figures in Paper;
and other her Artificial Curiosities.
I Have often read that Art a Handmaid was
Unto Dame-Nature, and not without Cause:
But now I see the contrary: for in you
I find the Proverb can no more be true:
For you in Art excel Dame Nature so,
That one would think your very Flowers do grow:
So well they are cut, by your ingenious hand,
When Curiosoes see 'em, they are at a stand;
And plainly say, That so it cannot be,
By any thing that is humane, but some Deity.
Nay, Painters do confess it is done so well,
They thought 'em natural, only for the smell.
For Men, Birds, Beasts, Fishes, Trees, Plants, and Flowers,
Are so well cut by that same hand of yours,
That all do stand amazed, and plainly say,
You in this Art do bear the Bell away.
It Is rare to see a Female Herald; yet you,
When of your Curiosities I took a view,
I saw some Coats of Arms so exactly done,
The Painters Pencils with Scissars You Have out-gone.
And painted Paper is the only Thing,
With the Clipping Tool, You to life do bring
To the Eye those things which seem inanimate.
I wish destroying Time may no period set
Unto those Eyes and Hands of Yours, which do
Employ themselves to your content, and ours too.
I Will say no more but this, and do despise
All flattery, That had I a thousand Eyes,
On Your Mysterious Art I would them fix,
So long as I am called
W. Hicks.

MOll bears in one hand fire, water in the other;
But in her Chaffindish bears both together.
She Is Ambodexter, with both her hands she plays;
Yet her Game's smister, both by nights and days.
She Is won with an Apple, and lost with a Nut;
Her Bum is no Bilbo, and yet it will cut
As keen as a Razor, that shaves away all,
Though she no sweet Water has, nor Barbars Ball.
A Loose Acquaintance once of me desired
To pass my word for Satin for a Suit;
But being loath to do what he required,
I of a Consonant became a Mute:
Which he took for Consent, and Satin got:
But seeing him mistake the Mute so much,
I Silence broke, and told him I would not,
Unless I kept the Stuff that must keep touch.
Had I been bound for one that was so loose,
I had been gulled, and pulled, and made a Goose.
On Fat Peg.
MArg'ret does muse how she so fat becomes,
That eats but once a day, to wit all day;
Her Breasts like Balloons, and like Globes her Bums,
One sleep serves her all night; that is to say,
All night she sleeps, she snores, she farts, past care,
Thus fares it with our Margaret, or great Mare.
Of Lying Robbin.
RObbin his Lies are not pernicious Lies,
But pleasant Fictions, hurtful unto none
But to himself; for no man counts him wise,
To tell for truth that which for false is known.
He swears that Gaunt is threescore miles about,
And that the Bridge at Paris on the Sein,
Is of such thickness, length, and breadth throughout,
That sixscore Arches can it scarce sustain.
He swears he saw so great a dead man's Skull
At Canterbury dug out of the ground,
That would contain of Wheat three Bushels full.
And that in Kent are twenty Yeomen found,
Of which the poorest every year dispends
Five thousand pounds. These and a thousand mo
So often he has recited to his Friends,
That now himself persuades himself it is so.
But why does Robbin tell his Lies so rife,
Of Bridges, Towns, and things that have no life?
He is a Lawyer, and does well espy
That of such Lies an Action will not lie.
Faults in Foreheads.
IF each ones Faults were in his Forehead writ,
Lives only would be read, the rest rejected.
Nor Hats nor Bonnets then would easily fit,
And lowest foreheads would be most respected.
The holy Hermit would be apprehended
Of Crimes unthought of, till we read 'em there:
Reputed Virgins would, Thirteen once ended,
In Colors full of Guiltiness appear.
Nor I my self that should my self know best,
Nor thou, dear Mistress, be at all exempted;
We should be both on many tongues professed,
Thou for thy yielding, I for having tempted.
But why should thou one fault for me avow?
Thy fautls are written in thy Husbands Brow.
A Scotch Song.
1.
I Needs must gang a Wooing,
I can no longer stay:
For Jinny is marred for doing,
Some Loon will steal her away.
2.
I Would not for a world
Leuse her good company;
For I have guds enough
To maintain her and I.
3.
A lang long live-long day
Is aul too little for me
To reckon up what I ha,
To derive my Pertigree.
4.
Feth Jocky, thou art to bleam,
I dare both say and swear;
Ise never come at thee again,
Till I know thy guds and thy geer.
5.
I have an awd Mear of mine awn,
She Is twenty year awd and sean,
She cost me twenty good Placks,
And now she is well worth elean.
6.
I have three dozen of Buttons,
Good Brass, and all in a string;
With a dainty Cale Whittle beside,
And a brave Curtain-Ring.
7.
I ha three shoes for a feut,
And two of them want soles,
With a dainty left-feut Beut,
And thrutteen dozen of holes.
8.
The Grains of a Fire Pore in,
The Rim of a Spinning-Wheel,
An old Huke for an Elsing-Haft,
A Spindle, a Rock, and a Reel.
9.
I have a good Hank of Yarn,
It Is three year since it was spun,
With a pair of Socks for a Barn,
And an end of awd Pipe Bum.
10.
My Granny she gave me a Hickle,
And Jinny, I give it to thee,
With hawf of a good awd Sickle;
And thus Riches run on with me.
11.
A Hook with a Lash in the end,
In money three Scotch Marks
On the wedding day we'll spend,
Or else we'll pawn our Sarks.
12.
We'll send for Sir John the Vicar,
And Meg and Maudlin sune,
And we'll have Crook Dick the Piper,
He Will play us a merry tune.
13.
And now to the Kirk they are gean,
And Jinny has hausted Jock:
For the De'il a Sark had Jocky,
Nor Jinny had never a Smock.
14.
And our Sir John the Vicar
Unto the matter did say,
Here Jinny tack thee Jocky,
And gea together gea.
15.
And the De'il gea with ye beath,
And send ye mickle shame,
For I never coupled sike together,
Since I to the Kirk first came.
A Song.
The Tune, Madams farewell.
1.
MY Youth it was free
From horror
And terror:
I never did agree
With the Black nor the Fair:
So stubborn I grew,
I laughed at,
And scoffed at
Those men that I knew
Were brought in Loves Snare.
Nay, more than this, I laughed at the pains
Men took to be wretched, and loaded with chains.
But when I the Charms of my Phillis did see,
I resigned up my heart, and refused to be free.
2.
My heart then began
To be fired
And mired
With Love: Never Man
Was in Fetters so fast:
Yet forgot that she was
A Woman,
For no Man
Could yet know the Cause
Why their love does not last.
I never considered the Tricks nor the Art
She used to entangle, and captive each Heart.
At length I discovered, and presently knew
That my Phillis was fickle, and could not be true.
3.
I cursed my hard fate,
That taught me
And brought me
Into this sad state,
Thus to kindle my flame:
When I did begin
To pause on it,
The cause on it
I knew it was mine,
Not my Phillis to blame.
I bore such respect to her, that I thought
Whatever she did, 'twas I was in fault.
At length I resolved that I never would be
So mad as to love, but would ever be free.
The Politic Wedding.
The Tune, Shackle de Hay.
1.
JAn and Nan were both in love,
And often met together;
And Wat and Kate did Rivals prove,
To watch their coming thither:
For Watty he did fancy Nan,
And Katy she was fond of Jan;
But 'twas unknown to either.
2.
At last it came to Watty's Ear
That Kate did fancy Janny;
And Katy she did likewise hear
That Wat's in love with Nanny:
And both together did agree
To spoil their former Amity;
But 'Twas unknown to any.
3.
So Watty did to Janny go,
And vowed he would be his Friend still,
By which intrigue he still did know,
Whatever they did intend still.
What news soever he did know,
To Katy he would quickly go,
Or unto her would send still.
4.
Poor Jan and Nan were sadly grieved,
To see they were betrayed still;
They knew not how they were deceived,
Wat so his Plots had laid still.
They knew it must be Wat alone
That did betray and still make known
What ever they did or said still.
5.
So both together laid a Plot
To frame a Quarrel neatly,
Whereby they might discover Wat,
And so come off completely:
For when that he unto them came,
A Quarrel they so well did frame,
That it succeeded featly.
6.
Then Wat away to Kate did go,
And quickly told her of it;
This news, says she, which now I know,
I ever more did covet.
And now the plot so well is laid,
And thee thy part so well have played,
Lets study to improve it.
7.
Then Katy went to Jan, and said,
That Nan's in love with Watty;
And Wat told Nan she was betrayed,
For Jan did fancy Katy.
By which they did discover that
They were betrayed by Kate and Wat,
In all their private Treaty.
8.
Then privately they thanked 'em both
For what they did discover,
And both seemed passionately wroth,
Calling each a perjured Lover.
Then Wat told Kate what he had done,
And Kate the thread that she had spun,
And for that time gave over.
9.
Of The morrow Jan for Kate did send,
And railed against poor Nanny;
And Nanny did on Watty spend
A groat, and railed on Janny.
And so't continued day by day,
That Wat and Kate would smile and say,
Poor Souls we shall trapan ye.
10.
When Jan and Nan had brought about
Their ends, they soon did marry:
For Wat and Kate did never doubt
Their plot could ever miscarry.
And being a bed on th'wedding-night,
Put Wat and Kate in such a fright,
They scarce could make 'em tarry.
11.
When Wat and Kate had paused a while.
And saw the were circumvented,
Both Jan and Nan put on a smile,
And both their loves presented;
And told them they knew how it was,
For love, not hatred, was the cause,
And prayed 'em rest contented.
12.
Wat then did go and kiss the Bride,
And took her by the hand too;
And Katy went a the other side,
And kissed her Lover Jan too.
Of The morrow Wat and Kate did wed,
And Jan and Nan saw them in bed,
And each kissed Maid and Man too.
13.
Next day for Music all did send,
And all their Friends invited;
And that their Loves might have no end,
Their Faiths they all there plighted.
Then Jan and Nan, and Wat and Kate
Did dance, and feast, and kiss, and prate,
Until they were benighted.
14.
Thus have you seen this double knot,
How both have had their speeding;
How both did plot and counter-plot,
And both on hopes were feeding,
And therefore now I do intend
At present for to make an end
Of this my Politic Wedding.
The Drunkards Invitation. A Song.
1.
COme take up your Cups and spare not,
And think no more hurt than I do;
Call for Quart after Quart,
To drive Sorrow from thy Heart;
And then tumble in the dirt as I do:
2.
Come take up your Liquor and stay not,
Still calling for more, as I do,
And up with your Drink,
Till you have spent all your Chink,
And then run on the Score as I do.
3.
Come take up your Drink, and flinch not,
And every day feast as I do;
Drink again and again,
Till you have filled every Vein,
And then spew like a Beast, as I do.
4.
Come trole it about with swiftness,
Be every day drunk as I,
And get many knocks,
Nay be put in the Stocks,
For kissing your Punk, as I do.
5.
Pick Quarrels, and fight in thy fury,
And meet with your match as I do,
And be laid by the Heels,
Though against your wills,
For abusing the Watch as I do.
6.
Come wind up your bottoms and care not,
Till you have belcht and stunk as I do,
Call for Pint after Pint,
Till the Brain's out of joint,
Then cast up what you have drunk as I do.
7.
I Will adopt you my Heirs at present,
And install you the Sons of King Priam;
So that you will be
So frolic and free,
To be every man drunk as I am.
A Scotch Song.
1.
ANd I mun ha my Goon made,
My Goon made, my Goon made,
And I mun ha my Goon made
Fit unto my Body;
Side and wide and long enough,
Side and wide and long enough,
Side and wide and long enough,
As fine as any Lady.
2.
And I mun ha my Goon trimmed up,
My Goon trimmed up, my Goon trimmed up,
And I mun ha my Goon trimmed up,
It Is true as I do tell ye;
Ten Seams laid down the Back,
Ten Seams laid down the Back,
Ten Seams laid down the Back,
And twenty down the Belly.
3.
An I mun ha a Wastcoat too,
A Wastcoat too, a Wastcoat too,
An I mun ha a Wastcoat too,
Twill hang down to my Weam too:
The Cloth must be of Scarlet fine,
The Cloth must be of Scarlet fine,
The Cloth must be of Scarlet fine,
With many a pratty Seam too.
4.
An I mun ha a Petticoat,
A Petticoat, a Petticoat,
An I mun ha a Petticoat,
Made of Crimson Tabby,
Laced up before, and round about,
Laced up before, and round about,
Laced up before, and round about,
As gay and fine as may be.
5.
Of Spanish Leather must be made,
Must be made, must be made,
Of Spanish Leather must be made
All the Shoes I wear, Jo;
With Silken Knot to tie 'em fast,
With Silken Knot to tie 'em fast,
With Silken Knot to tie 'em fast;
I would I had 'em here, Jo.
6.
If thou wilt lend me thy Loom, Lad,
Thy Loom, Lad, thy Loom Lad;
If thou'l t lend me thy Loom, Lad,
I Will lend thee mine again, Jo.
The De'il a bit my Loom I Will lend,
I lent it unto nine or ten,
And they have sent it hack again,
But put it out of frame, Jo.
A Song.
1.
LEt Back and Sides go bare,
Let Hand and Foot go cold:
But O let the Belly have Ale enough,
Whether it be new or old,
Whether it be new or old, Boys,
Whether it be new or old.
But O let the Belly have Ale enough,
Whether it be new or old.
2.
A Beggars a thing as good as a King,
I Will tell you the reason why:
For a King cannot swagger,
And drink like a Beggar,
No King so merry as I,
No King so merry as I, Boys,
No King so merry as I.
For a King cannot swagger,
And drink like a Beggar:
No King so merry as I.
3.
Some call me Knave and rascally Slave,
But I know how to collogue:
For then I adore 'um, and call 'em of the Quorum,
And then I Am an honest Rogue,
And then I Am an honest Rogue, Boys,
And then I Am an honest Rogue:
For then I adore 'um, and call 'em of the Quorum,
And then I Am an honest Rogue.
4.
If a fart flies away, where makes he his stay?
Can any man think or suppose?
For a fart cannot tell, when it is out, where to dwell,
Unless it be in your Nose,
Unless it be in your Nose, Boys,
Unless it be in your Nose:
For a fart cannot tell, when it is out, where to dwell,
Unless it be in your Nose.
Queen ELIZABETH's Song.
The Tune is, Sellengers Round.
1.
I Tell you all, both great and small,
And I tell you truly,
That we have a very great cause all
For to lament and cry,
O fie, O fie, O fie, O fie,
O fie on cruel Death;
For he has taken away from us
Our good Queen Elsabeth.
2.
He might have taken other good voke,
That better might have been mist,
And left our gracious Queen alive,
That loved no Popish Priest.
She ruled this famous Land alone,
And was beholding to no man:
She bore the weight of all affairs,
And yet she was but a woman.
3.
A Woman, said I, Nay, that is more
Than any one can tell:
So fair she was, so wondrous chaste,
That no man knew it well.
The Monsieur came himself from France,
On purpose for to woo her;
And yet she lived and died a Maid,
Do any man what he could to her.
4.
She never did any wicked thing,
That might in Conscience prick her,
Nor never submitted her self to him
The Papists call Christ's Vicar.
But rather chose courageously
To fight under Christ's Banner,
Against Turk, and Pope, and King of Spain,
Or all that durst withstand her.
5.
And if I had Argus Eyes, alas,
They were too few to weep
For our good Queen Elizabeth,
That now does lie asleep.
Asleep, quoth I, she now does lie,
Until the day of Doom:
And then she will rise to the foul disgrace
Of the great Pope of Rome.
A Song. To Fortune.
1.
BLind Fortune, if thou want a Guide,
I Will teach thee how thou may divide;
Distribute unto each his due:
Justice is blind, Justice is blind,
Justice is blind, and so are you.
2.
To the Usurer this doom impart,
May the Scrivener break his heart;
His Debtors unto Beggary fall;
Or what is as bad, or what is as bad,
Or what is as bad, Turn Courtiers all.
3.
And to the Tradesmen that sell dear,
A long Vacation all the year:
Revenge thee thus on their deceits;
And send them Wives, and send them Wives,
And send them Wives light as their Weights.
4.
But Fortune, who will recompense
The Frenchmans daily Insolence?
For them I know no greater pain,
Then to be sent, then to be sent,
Then to be sent to France again.
Chorus in Two Parts.
5.
If these Instructions make thee wise,
Men will restore again thine Eyes;
By a New Style thou shall commence,
Not Fortune called, not Fortune called,
Not Fortune call*d, but Providence.
6.
But lest thine Altars want all fires,
To bribe men's votes, grant their desires.
To Lovers who would not believe
Their sweet mistakes, their sweet mistakes,
Their sweet mistakes, thy Blindness give.
7.
Then lest the Players should grow poor,
Send them Aglaura's more and more:
And to the Roundhead grant more Ears
Than Ceres in, than Ceres in,
Than Ceres in her Garland wears.
8.
And if thou will Physicians please,
Send them another new Disease.
To Scholars give, if thou can do it,
A Benefice, a Benefice,
A Benefice without a Suit.
9.
To Courtiers grant them pleasures high,
And to their Wives Community.
So Fortune, thou will please them all;
If Lords do rise, if Lords do rise,
If Lords do rise, and Ladies fall.
10.
And to the Lawyers I Will beseech
As much for Silence as for Speech.
To Ladies Ushers strength of Back;
And to my Self, and to my Self,
And to my Self a Cup of Sack.
On Mr. Owen's Death, Butler of a College.
Why Death did honest Owen so soon catch,
Into my mind it cannot easily sink,
Unless that Death came to the Buttery Hatch,
And honest Owen would not make him drink.
If it be so, then Owen 'twas thy fault,
That Death, instead of Drink, made thee his Draught.
Not so, nor so; for Owen gave him Liquor;
Death being fox'd, took him away the quicker.
Yet be content, let care never trouble thy mind,
Though the Butlers gone, the Keys are left behind.
On the same Owen.
FUll four and twenty Letters once there were,
And O. and N. were two among the rest;
But they their number henceforth cannot bear,
For O. and N. are buried in a Chest.
Had O. been gone, no man had it repented,
And then it would full well have been for us.
But O. N.'s gone, which is to be lamented;
So Fortune's to us much preposterous.
Owen, let Schoolboys glory in thy fall:
Because they have two Letters less to con;
For two and twenty now is only all,
By means of which, they often will save their Bum.
Whilst we'll condole thy Death, since by it we get
A Lamed Christ's Cross, and a Crippled Alphabet.
On Great Tom of Christ-Church, his being newly Cast.
BE dumb, you Infant-Chimes, thump not your Mettle,
That never out-rings the Tinker and his Kettle.
Cease all you petty Larums, for to day,
It Is Great Tom's Resurrection from the Clay:
And know where Tom rings out his loudest knells,
The best of you will be but Dinner-Bells.
And for thy meritorious suffering,
Thou shortly shall to Heaven in a string.
We much are grieved, because we see thee cast,
As being not well: yet hope the worst is past.
Some say it was, because thy Brain was cracked;
If it be so, then well done was the fact:
And though some Cains have made A Bell of thee,
Thou't Clapper-claw 'em, when thou once art free.
Thou't thunder out at nine a Clock such noise
Will make the Scholars all to dread thy voice:
And after Thunder, fierce Lightning then may come,
From Proctor or Vice Chancellor; Hasten home.
Well, dearest Tom, I Will take my leave of thee,
And think ever long thou't be too high for me:
And for thy sins did fall as low as Clay,
And through a fiery Trial did run, they say,
To clear thy jarring temper, which was sore
Against thy will, as being hoarse before.
And coming down, dear Tom, to learn to sing
A better Note, we hope thou't make it ring
In all our Ears, thou mended have thy voice;
'Twill make the Scholars, unless at nine a Clock, rejoice.
Nay, 'twill please the hearts of all good People,
Whence once you are lifted up into the Steeple;
Unless Fanatics, who regard it not a Louse,
Whatever comes from the Steeple-house.
And though we grieve to see thee thump'd and banged,
Yet all rejoice, great Tom, to see thee hanged.
The Maids Complaint.
1.
IT was in the merry month of May,
When every thing looked fresh and gay,
I heard a Maid complain and say,
Her Mother she had done her mickle wrong,
For suffering her to live a Maid so long.
2.
Then she began to sigh and groan,
To ring her hands, and make great moan,
'Cause she, poor heart, was left alone.
And no kind Soul would ever pity her pain,
For her Maidenheads loss would prove to her a gain.
3.
I nimbly then did step unto her,
And presently became a Woer;
And that of me she should be sure,
Would give her a dose should her malady quell;
But still she vowed she would never lead Apes in Hell.
4.
Then to Courting I began,
And told her I would be the Man:
Though before she looked both pale and wan,
Yet now in her cheeks a color 'gan to rise:
But still she said, Pray Sir be merry and wise.
5.
What was done, I must not tell,
But yet I found she liked it well,
Because sh'd never lead Apes in Hell.
And then of Kisses she gave me such plenty,
That one of mine produced the number twenty.
6.
I then began to haste away,
But she in kindness prayed me stay;
I bid her 'point another day,
She told me then to morrow, pray come hither,
That so we may our Notes compare together.
On a Parsimonious Sheriff of Oxford.
FIe, Scholars, fie; have you such thirsty Souls,
To swig, quaff, and carouse 'ith' Sheriffs Bowls?
Tell me, mad Youngsters, what do you believe?
Do You think it cost him nothing to be Shrieve?
To send so many Beefes, so many Weathers,
Maintain so many Hats, so many Feathers?
Again, is Malt so cheap this pinching year,
That you should make such havoc of his Beer?
I hear you are so many, that you make
Most of his Men turn Tapsters for your sake:
And yet, when he even at the Bench does sit,
You tear his Meat from off the borrowed Spit,
And keep such hurly-burly as it passes,
In gurgitating sometimes whole half Glasses.
And some of you forsooth are grown so fine,
Or else so saucy, as to call for Wine.
As if the Sheriff had put men in trust,
Which durst draw out more Wine than needs they must.
In faith, in faith, it is not well, my Masters,
Nor fit that you should be the Sheriffs Tasters.
It were enough, you are such Gormandizers,
To make the Sheriffs henceforth all turn Misers:
Or to remove the Assize to the Towns Disgrace,
To Banbury, Henly, or else some such place,
He never had complained, had it but been
A pretty Firkin, or a Kilderkin:
But when a Barrel daily is drunk out!
My Masters then it is time to look about.
Is this a lie do you think? I tell you no:
My Lord High Chancellor was informed so:
And O what would not all the Bread in Town
Suffice to drive the Sheriffs Liquor down,
But he in Hampers must from home it bring?
O most prodigious, O most monstrous thing!
Upon so many Loaves of Home-made Bread,
How long might he and his ten men have fed?
Which he, no doubt, intended to have fed
With the sweet Morsels of his broken Bread.
But when that they, poor Souls, for Bread did call,
Answer was made, The Scholars eat up all:
And when of broken Beer he craved a Cup,
Answer was made, The Scholars drank it up.
And this I know not how they changed the Name,
Cut did the Deed, and Longtail bears the blame.
The Speech of a Mayor of a Town, when a King came there.
GReat King, to bid Thee welcome, behold I
Do speak to Thee, although my mouth stand by:
I Will do my best, but he can do much better;
He is Book-learn'd, I never knew a Letter.
When yesterday the Post did Tidings bring,
That I should see You here, our Royal King;
For my own part into an Ague I did fall,
And greatly gasped with my Brethren all.
But least your Majesty should think us slack,
Each one of us did drink a Pint of Sack;
Armor of Proof, the best thing we could find
To cheer our heart, and ease our troubled mind.
We went about to muster up our forces
To meet You, but indeed we wanted Horses.
Our Foot-Cloths also, with Rats and Mice offended,
In so short space could not be patched and mended,
Therefore this Stage, which holds us here at large,
Was wisely founded at the Towns own charge.
These men in Scarlet, that you plainly see,
Have been in highest place of Majesty;
The other Purple Gowns that do appear,
Are like to wear my Staff another year.
The Streets that you do pass on either hand,
Are sweetly flowr'd with Gravel and with Sand.
The Conduit at the Cross, if you mark well,
Is newly painted, you may know by the smell:
The place against it, is the place where I
Do sit in all my Pomp and Dignity:
Whilst I do Justice, be it Right or Wrong,
Unto the Rich or Poor, the Old or Young.
St. Peter's Church, where I am often seen,
Stands near unto it, but a House between;
Where every Sunday unto my poor Power,
Sleeping and waking, I do spend an hour.
Your Grace may see our Houses have been spunging,
And your Neat Wine shall be without much blunging.
But in this one thing pray by me be ruled,
Do not drink of it unless you find it mull'd:
But if you see it look blew on either side,
Then to it; I wis you need no other Guide.
Our Towns not rich, yet God be thanked,
With no small Charge we have procured a Banquet,
Four pounds it cost, besides I am afraid
The Carriage of it down is yet unpaid:
If you had come to Dinner, without boast,
You should have eat with me no worse than Roast.
For though I say it, I would have let you loose
Unto the flank of a fat buttered Goose.
A Cup of Gold unto Your Grace I Will bring,
I hope You Will give to us some better thing.
For I Will besworn that it goes near my heart,
When from so many Goldings I did part:
But much good d'it ye, we will never repent;
Since they are gone, they might on worse be spent.
Some say of me you mean to make a Knight;
Nay rather take a Halter and hang me quite;
That it may never be said, it came to pass,
That it bestowed was on Balaam's Ass:
Therefore I humbly crave I may go free,
And give it to the Mayor of some City.
Thus from my speech abruptly I will break,
And if you will know me, hear the Recorder speak.
The Description of a Beautiful Woman.
THese thirty Things that Helens fame did raise,
A Dame must have, that seeks for Virtues praise.
Three bright, three black, three red, three short, three tall;
Three thick, three thin, three close, three wide, three small.
Her Skin, Teeth, Cheeks, must be clean, bright, and neat;
Her Hair, her Brows and Eyes as black as Jet:
Her Cheeks, Lips, Nails, must have Vermilion hue;
Her Hands, Hair, Height, must show good length to view.
Her Teeth, Feet, Ears, all short, no length allow;
Large Breast, large Bum, a large and spacious Brow.
Her Mouth must narrow be, small Waste and tender;
Her Eyes, Lips, Nose, must be but thin and slender.
Her Neck, Waste, Ancles, slender and small must be,
That Teeth, Tongue, Lips, be close kept, not too free.
Her Neck, Thighs, Navel, must be fat and round;
Her Nose, Head, Teats, the least that may be found.
Her Brows, her Looks, and Breasts must wideness have;
Her Nostril, Mouth, Ear, smallness: Then all is brave.
Since such Perfections few or none attain,
Then few or none are fair, the place is plain.
Of a Ladies Dog, and her Husband.
LAugh, good my Masters, if you can intend it,
For yonder comes a Fool that will defend it.
Saw you a verier Ass in all your Life,
That makes himself a Pack-horse to his Wife?
I would his Nose where I could wish were warm,
For carrying Pearl so pretty under's Arm:
Pearl his Wise's Dog, a pretty Sweet-fac'd Cur,
That barks at night at the least fart does stir,
Is now not well, his Cold is scarcely broke;
Therefore, good Husband, wrap him in thy Cloak:
And Sweetheart, prithee help me to my Mask:
Hold Pearl but tender, for he has a Lask.
Here, take my Muff; and do you hear, good man,
Now give me Pearl, and carry you my Fan:
Alas poor Pearl! The Wretch is full of pain:
Husband, take Pearl; give me my Fan again.
See how he quakes! Faith I am like to weep:
Come to me, Pearl: my Scarff, good Husband, keep.
To be with me, I know my Puppy loves:
Why Pearl, I say! Husband, take up my Gloves.
Thus goodman Idiot thinks himself an Earl,
That he can please his Wife, and carry Pearl.
But others judge his State to be no higher
Than a Dogs Yeoman, or some Pippin-Squire.
On a Punk.
FAith, Gentlemen, you move me to offense,
In coming to me with unchaste pretense:
Have I the look of a lascivious Dame,
That you should think me fit for wantons Game?
I am not she will take Lusts Sin upon her;
I Will rather die, than dim chaste glorious honor.
Tempt not mine Ears, for in good sooth I mean
To keep my honest Reputation clean.
My hearing lets no such lewd sound come in,
My Senses loath to surfeit on sweet sin.
Reverse your Mind that goes from Grace astray;
And God forgive you, with my heart I pray.
The Gallant notes her words, observes her frowns,
Then draws his Purse, and lets her view his Crowns.
Vowing that if her kindness grant him pleasure,
She shall be Mistress to command his Treasure.
The storms are calmed, the gust is over-blown;
And she replies with, Yours, else not her own.
Desiring him to censure for the best,
'Twas but her Trick, to try if men do jest.
Her Love is locked where he may pick the Trunk.
Let all men judge, if this be not a Punk.
The Complying, but Cunning Lass.
The Tune, My Nanny, quoth he; a Jig Tune.
1.
MY Gilly, says Will;
My Willy, says Gill,
Your pleasure?
I Would speak wi' you, says Will;
Come now then, says Gill,
I Am at leisure.
I love thee, says Will:
Do You love me, says Gill,
Indeed Sir?
Yes truly, says Will;
Why well then, says Gill,
Proceed, Sir.
2.
I Would woo thee, says Will:
Would you woo me, says Gill,
But how, Sir?
In Marriage, says Will,
I Marriage, says Gill,
I allow Sir:
First kiss me, says Will:
Why there it is, says Gill;
Now you have it, Sir,
I Am glad on it, says Will;
I Am not sorry, says Gill,
That's flat, Sir.
3.
Give me another, says Will:
There, take it says Gill;
What then, Sir?
Why a third, says Will:
Why there it is, says Gill,
Again, Sir.
I Am ravished, says Will:
How? Ravished, says Gill!
Be plain, Sir.
By your Kisses, says Will:
Then I Will do it, says Gill,
Again, Sir.
4.
I Will feoff thee, says Will,
In a Jointure: Says Gill,
Do You mean so?
Yes truly, says Will:
Then I love thee, says Gill;
It Is even so.
Here Is my hand on it, says Will,
There Is mine too, says Gill,
With love too.
Be but constant says Will;
Yes constant, says Gill,
I Will prove too.
5.
When wed we, says Will?
To morrow, says Gill,
In The morning.
That Is too soon, says Will;
I Will be at (says Gill)
An hours warning
That Is well sed, says Will;
'Twas not ill sed, says Gill,
Believe me.
Then next day, says Will;
If It be longer says, Gill,
'Twill grieve me.
6.
Get a License, says Will;
That will I, says Gill,
To morrow.
Have you money, says Will?
If I have not, says Gill,
I Will borrow.
That Is a kind wench, says Will,
I Will be kinder, says Gill,
When wedded:
And what then, says Will?
I Will be kindest, says Gill,
When bedded.
7.
Lie wi' me, says Will:
What to night, says Gill?
O fie Sir!
Prithee do it, says Will:
By my troth, says Gill,
Not I Sir.
You Are unkind, says Will:
You Are too forward says Gill,
Believe me.
Will Not you do it then, says Will,
That Is the way, says Gill,
To deceive me.
The Chorus to it.
8.
So before they did bed,
They were both of 'em wed,
At night he
Did say unto Gill,
Had you given me my will,
I Would a slight ye.
I had no reason, says she,
To grant it unt'ee,
I Am sure, Sir;
Because I was cozened
By It least half a dozen,
Before, Sir,
9.
I Will tell thee, says he,
Some Girls were so free,
They sent me
Each of 'em a Cake,
For some kindness sake,
To content me.
Had I known't, says she,
I Would a fitted ye
For their sakes, Sir.
On that very score,
With Cheeses good store,
To your Cakes, Sir.
The Little Childrens Figure-Dance, at Mr. Young's Ball,
and to that Tune.
SOme pretty Ladies
No bigger than Babies:
Did dance at a Ball so well,
Yet so little they were,
And so young, you would swear
They were newly come out of the shell.
But yet these little things
Did keep both time and figure,
And to give 'em their due,
They footed it true:
And the less as well as the bigger.
2.
And first pretty C --
Did mount like a Lark,
To seek out her lovely Mate:
I mean T. H.
That witty Bearn,
Who readily came to her strait,
Then the other airy Cl --
Did look for her rosy-cheek Dove,
Sweet W -- Y -- the mild,
That modest Child,
Who handsomely to her did move.
3.
Witty S -- f -- too,
Did wheel to and fro,
And nimbly tript it about,
With her Partner S --
That was airy and blithe,
And neither of both were out.
Then pretty S -- b -- she
Did follow this little Crew,
With her Partner eke,
Pretty M -- d -- the Meek,
Who still danced every thing true.
4.
At the end of the Tune,
But not too soon,
They all did make a stand;
And when they had done,
Then every one
Their Partners took by the hand.
At last these pretty things
Their Honors did so well,
That all did say,
For their Age, that they
Did bear away the Bell.
Advice to a Friend to forgo a Common Miss.
To the Scotch Tune, Go, go, Unkind One.
1.
He Is an Ass that loves one,
And will love no more:
If by chance he proves one
True, he will find a score
That are as arrant Starters
As ever trod on Shoe;
To lie and swear,
And speak you fair,
And vow they will still be true;
Yet promise to another
What they have vowed to you.
2.
When the Ginneys do appear,
Then their love is shown;
They Will kiss and sing, and dance and swear,
I Am yours, or not my own.
But when the Purse begins to ebb,
Then they will overflow
In slights and pouts,
And scorns and flouts,
And off their faith will throw,
And to another Cully
Will make a second vow.
3.
Then leave off courting Misses
If you will be free
From Quarrels and Diseases,
And certain Povertio.
But if you must a Miss have,
Let it be brisk Wine;
'Twill cure the heart
Of all the smart,
And make the face to shine
With bubles and with Pearls too,
Beyond the Indian Mine.
A Song at the Dukes House.
1.
NAy, let me alone;
I protest I Will be gone:
It Is a folly to think
I Will be subject to one.
Never hope to confine
A young Gallant to dine,
Like a Scholar of Oxford,
On none but a Loin.
For after Enjoyment, our Bellies are full;
And the same Dish again, makes the Appetite dull.
2.
By your wantoning Art
Of a sigh and a start,
You endeavor in vain
To inveagle my heart.
For the pretty disguise
Of your languishing Eyes
Will never prevail
With my Sinews to rise.
It Is never the mode in an Amorous Treat,
When a Lover has dined, to persuade him to eat.
3.
Faith Betty, the Jest
Is almost at the best,
It Is only variety
Makes up the feast.
For when we have enjoyed,
And with pleasures are cloid
The Vows we have made
To love ever, are void.
And know, pretty Nymph, it was ever unfit
That a Meal should be made of a Rellishing Bit.
The Careless Lover.
1.
AM I by thy taunts abused,
When I most to love incline?
Know no phrase by thee is used,
Which I could not well make mine,
For I can use or not use thine.
2.
Do thou glory thou can vex me,
When thou seemingly do chide?
Or do thou think thou can perplex me
With thy scoffs or careless pride?
No: all thy fancies I deride.
3.
Art thou with my Courtship pleased,
Which I tender unto thee?
Or art thou with my words diseased?
If thou art, it is naught to me:
For I can love, or let thee be.
4.
Can thou love with true Affection?
I can love, being loved again:
Or if to hate be thy Election,
All that breeds me no pain:
For I can love, or can disdain.
5.
Art thou pleased I should attend thee?
I will still thy Servant be:
Or if my presence do offend thee,
I will never wait on thee:
For I can serve, or keep me free.
6.
Do thou love to have me near thee,
With a Heart both firm and true?
Or do thou scorn my sight and jeer me,
This to Lovers is not new:
Faith I can stay, or bid adieu.
7.
Art thou joyful? I am jolly;
In thy pleasure's my delight:
Art thou inclined to Melancholy?
I am of that humor right:
For I can Joy, or Joys can slight.
8.
Art thou liberal of Embraces?
I can also lavish be?
Or do thou scorn to yield such graces?
I can scorn as well as thee;
Of these I can be nice or free.
9.
Do thou please to yield me Kisses,
My observance to requite?
Or do deny me those sweet blisses,
In some humor or despite?
I can dispense with that delight.
10.
If to singing thou wilt apply thee,
I can warble Notes to thee;
Or if to sighing, I Will sigh by thee;
To thy Passions I Will agree:
For I Am to all thy humors free.
11.
Could thou willingly abide me,
In thy naked Bosom lie?
Would thou, if I ventured, chide me,
Or with frowning force me fly?
All Is one to me: for what care I?
A Catch.
FOrtune is blind,
And Beauty is kind:
They Have neither faith nor troth;
The one is a Witch,
And to other's a Bitch:
The Devil take them both.
There Is hazard by hap,
To sit in a Lap;
But there is no deceit in a Brimmer,
Truth in the bottom does lie;
But the way to redeem her,
Is to drink the whole Ocean dry.
A Catch.
1.
NO Creature can be
More pleasant then we;
No mischief we'll act or invent;
Let Wordlings go plot
Until their Brains rot,
They shall not a bridge our content.
3.
Content is a thing
That Comfort does bring
To beggar as well as to King.
Then let our Content
In Freedom be spent,
And merrily, merrily sing,
A Catch.
1.
AS soon a little little Ant
Shall bib the Ocean dry,
A Snail shall creep about the World,
Ever our Affections die.
2.
Yet she is for me, and only she,
That Is neither forward, nor too free:
That Wench I vow shall be my Joy,
That Is neither forward, nor too coy.
A Catch.
There is but only one,
And I am only he,
That loves but one alone,
And thou art only she.
Thou art that one
In whom alone
My heart does only care,
Then do but join
Thy heart with mine,
And we will make a pair.
Her Answer.
THe Girl did then reply,
I am the only she
That loves one faithfully,
And faith, my Jack, it is thee.
Thou art my Joy,
And only Boy;
I never think on other:
And mean to join
My heart with thine,
And so be made a Mother.
A Song.
1.
Employ thy time some other way,
Than still to court this Female Clay;
Let her be what a Woman can,
Yet she is not worth the worst of Man.
2.
It is not I that tell you so.
Reason has done that long ago:
Had thou to reason but inclined,
Thou long ere this had changed thy mind.
3.
She is a Woman; that is enough
To quench the furious flames of Love:
For they are only but for sight;
Gloworm-like, they are best by night.
4.
I know she is young and fair; it is true,
And well enough for outward view:
But if unclothed thou did her see,
She is not what she seems to be.
5.
I therefore do advise thee yet,
Before thou into thraldom get:
A labrynth then thou't find 'twil prove,
And feel the doleful pangs of Love.
6.
But if loving thou needs must be,
Pray let it be no more a she:
But love thy Self, and love thy Friend,
And love good Sack, and there is an end.
The Martial Lad. A Mock to O Love if ever thou wilt ease a heart,
and to that Tune.
1.
O Mars, if ever thou wilt ease a Blade
That owns thy Martial Power,
That bleeds with thy too cruel Trade,
And now by wounds is quite decayed,
Thy Blessings on me shower.
Under the Surgeons hand I lie,
A thousand times I wish to die;
But when I see cold Death so nigh,
I grieve to leave those thoughts of War
Which unto Soldiers welcome are.
2.
But thus as I sat all alone
In The cold and lousie Room,
Some Tatling Echo heard my moan,
And did repeat each sigh and groan,
Came by a simple Groom.
O how I strove my face to hide,
Lest by the Groom it should be spide!
And did the Babbling Echo chide,
Because her iterating noise
Had brought the man to know my Voice.
3.
But O Great Mars! I wish to have
But one poor Thundering Peal
Of Guns and Muskets which I crave
Before my Body's laid in Grave,
My Honor to reveal.
Thus are poor Soldiers often abused,
When they by Wounds and Scars are bruised,
Yet are by Mortals worse abused:
When they by War have got a Name,
In times of Peace must lose the same.
Upon his Dead Mistress.
AS Unthrifts grieve in Straw for their pawned Beds,
As Women weep for their lost Maiden-heads,
When both are without hope or Remedy;
Such an untimely grief have I for thee.
I never saw thy Face, nor did my heart
Urge forth my Eyes to that, whilst that thou were.
But being lifted hence, that which to thee
Was Deaths sad Dart, was Cupid's Ghost to me.
Whoever thinks me foolish, that the force
Of a Report should make me love a Coarse;
Know he, That when with this I do compare
The love I to a living Woman bear,
I find my self most happy: Now I know
Where I shall find my Mistress; I can go
Unto her timeless Bed, and lift away
Her Grass-green Mantle, and her Sheet display,
And touch her naked; and though envious Mould
(In which she lies unsuccour'd, moist and cold)
Strive to corrupt her, she will not abide
With any Art her Blemishes to hide,
As many Living do: And, though they need,
Yet cannot they in Sweetness her exceed;
But make a stink with all their Art and Skill,
Which the Physicians warrant by their Bill.
Nor at her Door does heaps of Coaches stay,
Footmen or Midwives, to bar up my way:
Nor is her heart so hard, to make me pay
For every Kiss, a Supper and a Play.
Nor need she any Page or Maid to keep,
To knock me early from my golden sleep,
With Letters, That her Honor all is gone,
If I don't Right her upon such a one.
Nor with Black Oaths stain her pure Lips will she:
She Will not contract the guilt of Perjury.
No words, profane or wanton, will she use;
Pure Virtue's strictest Rules she will not accuse,
As too severe; nor whilst the World does last,
A Blemish on her Spotless Honor cast.
Pardon me, that with thy blessed Memory,
I mingle my own former Misery.
Yet dare I not accuse the Fate that brought
These Crosses on me, for then every thought
That tended to my Love, was black and foul;
Now all is pure as a new-baptiz'd Soul.
For I protest, for all that I can see,
I would not lie in Bed one night with thee:
Nor am I jealous, but could well abide
My Foe to lie in quiet by thy side.
You Worms, (my Rivals) whilst she was alive,
How many thousands were there that did strive
To have your freedom? for their sakes forbear
Unseemly holes in her soft Skin to wear.
But if you must, (as what Worm can abstain
To taste her Tender Body?) yet refrain
With your disordered Eatings to deface her,
And feed your selves so as you most may grace her.
First, through her Ear-Tips see you make a pair
Of Holes, which as the moist enclosed Air
Turns into Water, may the clear Drops take,
And in her Ears a pair of Jewels make.
Have you not yet enough of that White Skin,
(The touch of which, in times past would have bin
Enough to ransom many a thousand Soul
Captived to Love) if not, then upward roll
Your little Bodies, where I would you have
This Epitaph upon her Forehead grave:
Living, She was Young, Fair, and full of Wit;
Dead, All her Faults are in her Forehead writ.
On Two Gentlemen of Wales.
I Heard, among some other pleasant Tales,
How once there were two Gentlemen of Wales.
These Two (thus goes the Tale) upon a day
Happened to travel upon London-way;
And (for 'twas cumbersome to wear a Boot)
For their more ease they needs would go a foot;
And (left they should their best Apparel lack)
Each of them wears his Wardrobe at his Back.
These Squires were Nighted ever they came to Town,
And sought their Lodging when the Sun was down:
And (for the Inkeeper his Gates had locked)
In haste, like men of some account, they knocked;
The drowsy Chamberlain asked who was there?
Who said that Gentlemen of Wales they were.
How many, quoth the man, is there of you?
Quoth he, Here Is John Ap Rice, Ap Jones, Ap Hugh,
Ap Nicholas, Ap Steven, Ap Rice, Ap Davy:
Then Gentlemen, quoth he, adieu, God save ye:
Your Worships might have had a Bod or twain,
But we have not enough for such a Train.
A Pastoral Dialogue between Cleon and Delia.
1.
AS Delia rested in the Shade,
With Cleon by her side;
The Swain thus courted the young Maid,
And thus the Nymph replied.
2.
Cleon. Sweet, let thy Captive Fetters wear,
Made of thine Arms and Hands;
Till those that Thraldom scorn or fear,
Envy my happy Bands.
3.
Delia. Then thus my willing Arms I wind
About thee, and am so
Thy Prisoner; for my self I bind,
Until I let thee go.
4.
Cle. Happy that Slave whom the fair Foe
Ties in so soft a Chain!
Del. More happy I, but that I know
Thou will break loose again.
5.
Cle. By thine Immortal Beauty never.
Del. Frail as thy Love's thine Oath.
Cle. Though Beauty fade, my Faith lasts ever.
Del. Time will destroy them both.
6.
Cle. I dote not on thy Snow-white Skin:
Del. What then? Cle. Thy Purer Mind.
Del. I loved too soon. Cle. Thou had not bin
So fair, if not so kind.
7.
Del. O strange vain fancy! Cle. But yet true.
Del. Prove it. Cle. Then make a Brade
Of those loose Flames that circle you;
My Suns and yet your Shade.
8.
Del. It Is done. Cle. Now give it me. Del. Thus thou
Shall thine own Error find;
If those were Beauties, I am now
Less fair, because more kind.
9.
Cle. You shall confess you err: That Hair
Must it not change the hue,
And leave that Golden Mountain bare?
Del. Ah me! It is too true.
10.
Cle. Yet this small Wreath shall ever stay
In its first native prime;
And smiling when the rest decay,
The Triumphs sing of Time.
11.
Del. Then let me cut from off that Grove
One Branch, and let it be
An Emblem of Eternal Love,
For such is mine to thee.
12.
Cle. Thus are we both redeemed from Time:
I by thy Grace. Del. And I
Shall live in thine Immortal Rhyme,
Until the Muses die.
13.
Cle. By Heaven -- Del. Swear not: If I must weep,
Jove shall not smile at me:
This Kiss, my Heart, and thy Faith keep.
Cle. This breathes my Soul to thee.
14.
Then forth the Thicket Thirfis rushed,
Where he saw all their play:
The Swain stood still, and smiled, and blushed;
The Nymph fled fast away.
FINIS
Mounsieur Nihils New-Years-gift.
THe costly Callends put me to a shift,
What I shall send you for my New-years-gift.
It Is not what Ophir yields, nor Gems, nor Gold,
I want not things that in the Exchange are sold,
Chains, Bracelets, Earrings, Rarities and Lawn,
The curious works by holy Sisters drawn
Are far above my reach to compass: so
All that I have is nothing to bestow.
Accept I pray the Gift, 't becomes you well,
For you do nothing want as I can tell.
Scorn not the present, look on it and you will find
It Is of much worth: nothing contents the mind,
Nothing is happy, nothing is truly good,
For nothing we pick quarrels and draw Blood.
And though for nothing Lawyers plead not now,
Yet about nothing they make much ado.
Physicians of nothing, say the Disease is great,
Yet if they nothing have, they will soon retreat.
Merchants think it nothing 'bout the world to sail,
And nothing comes on it sometimes by an ill gale.
The Rump-Parliament did nothing but mischief crave,
Being Hanged, 'twas nothing but what they did deserve.
Gaming is good for nothing but Fight and Curse,
Yet when all is gone, they think nothing worse.
Those that ill memories have, no patience want,
When they forget all, they think nothing on it.
Nothing is dearer than a Mistress sight,
Yet good for nothing when she is known to be Right.
Nothing is sweeter then the new cropped Rose,
Nothing is whiter then the Alpin Snows:
Nothing is better than a trusty Friend,
Yet nothing worse if Quarrel be at the end.
Nothings so good as meat to a hungry Soul,
Yet nothing worse, if poison be in the bowl.
Nothings like Wine, the heart to exhilerate,
Yet nothing worse, if it be Sophisticate.
Nothings in every Child's mouth that is unruly,
Ask them what they did, I did nothing truly.
So rare was nothing, that long since 'twas made
Reward unto desert: so service was paid
Richly with nothing: therefore do not grieve
To wear this new-thing nothing on your Sleeve.
Or if you think 'twill not become you there,
Let then this nothing new dangle in your ear.
So taking leave at Dover on the high-hill,
I rest your Annihilated Friend Monsieur Nihil.
Madam Aliqua's Retort.
SIr I do find that you have made a shift
To send me nothing for my New-Years-gift.
Which you may find I can make something of.
And that you may perhaps at something scoff
Which I shall say: hark my nothing Shaver,
Do you not know that something has a savor:
Something for this Friend, and something for that
I have; but you perhaps will ask me what
That something is, that I so freely spare
Unto my other Friends, and you not share
Therein; for you shall nothing have to your part,
You Will ask what nothings that, Faith it is a Fart;
You may perchance smell something in 't, if you do
Take It for your pains, nay you may Nose it to:
And if you find that nothing then does please you,
Yet you may smell that something dos disease you.
Something you know's for food, something for smell,
Which you by late Experience know full well.
If something I Have said, touch you to the quick,
You Will make nothing on it although it made you Sick.
If nothing out of something cannot be picked,
Then nothing deserves by something to be kick't.
But how can nothing then be kicked you will say,
Yes something has been kik't to nothing quite away.
Have I not said something to the purpose now,
Yet I fear this something nothing pleases you.
I something have to say, but this once more,
You nothing do deserve, cause to the poor
You nothing give, and as thou wilt nothing spend,
I wish thy something, may be nothing in the end.
And as your costly Callends is the first day
Of The Month, I hope before the last you may
Taste something of the Rope: then the Sessions ends,
For at Tiburn a multitude of Friends
Take leave of one another: so will I
Come there, to see my Benefactor fly
To make a clapper for a wooden Bell:
And there I do intend to bid farewell
To Monsieur Nihil; and this on something say,
I hope you have nothing lost by Madam Aliqua.
The Soldiers Song.
THough the Morning was wet,
We are merrily met
In a house more dry then our skin Boys.
Weel drink down the day,
Never question our pay,
Let them heartily laugh out that win Boys.
Chorus. Then drink a full brimmer to him that intends
For the good of the Soldier to labor his ends.
2.
Let him flatter and lie,
What is it to thee and I,
And Ape Noll in every condition.
If we thrive upon it,
Let all the World want,
And the City kneel down and Petition.
Chorus. Then drink a full brimmer to him that intends
For the good of the Soldier to labor his ends.
Another Song.
1.
WE came from Scotland with a small force,
With a hey down, down a down a,
But with hearts far truer then steel.
We got by my Fay,
The glory of the Day,
Yet no man a hurt did feel.
2.
When Lambert first our Army did face,
With a hey down, down a down a,
He looked as fierce as the Devil.
We feared a Rout,
But he faced about
The Gentleman was so civil.
3.
General Monk with the Countries Love,
With a hey down, down a down a.
All persons to him did address,
Small money we spent
For we found as we went
Good Friends, and here find no less.
A New Song.
THe day you wished Arrived at last,
You wish as much that it were past:
One Minute more, and Night will hide,
The Bridegroom and the blushing Bride.
The Virgin now to Bed does go,
Take heed, O Youth, she rise not so.
She pants and trembles at her Doom,
And fears, and wishes thou would come:
The Bridegroom comes, he comes apace,
With Love and Fury in his Face;
She shrinks away, he close pursues,
Prays and threats at once does use;
She softly sighing, begs delay,
And with her hand puts him away;
Then out aloud for help she cries,
And then dispairing shuts her eyes.
Another New Song.
1.
WHy, O Cupid, so do thou shun,
Thy disdains alas have undone me:
When you left me to choose at my pleasure,
I robbed my poor heart of its treasure.
And now all in vain I pine and moan,
For the only man I love alas is gone.
2.
Since you wounded my heart, now in vain
Let my Sighs recall him again.
I Will lament my unfortunate hour,
I Will blame, and at once bless thy power.
If by sighs and tears, I may but once restore
Him into my Arms, or else let me love no more.
To the Minnuet Tune.
SInce my free hopes are tossed on despair,
And faithless Armeda is deaf to my Prayer:
This to her frailty of power I Will shove,
That which gives me despair can never force me to love.
Beauty in flames, where affection is poor,
There the blind Sott, though he is kicked out a door,
Will still her good Nature and Beauty Implore.
Fondness of love is obliging in no man,
Wheadles and Amorous dying is common.
It Is the true heart (removed by a scorn,)
Can place a love that never shall be worn.
Another Song.
OH stay my dear Phillis before you resign,
That heart to an other which ought to be mine.
My faith and obedience my Title does prove,
If you will allow Justice and Reason in Love:
But if your old Kindness for me you will abate,
Being tempted to yield for a better Estate.
I find me mistaken, for vainly I thought,
That Virtue and Love were not to be bought.
Accursed be the Inventer of Joynters and Dowers,
The want whereof makes me sit many sad hours.
Since Women I find has not power to say no,
To a Fool that is fine, and has Writings to show.
Though their Bodies and Minds alike are unsound
Yet their wealth for their faults and their follies compound.
What Virtues are those then that e're can prevail,
Since Marriage and Love are but Bargain and Sale.
O fie on Desemblars, whose business I find
Is only to vex and torment a man's mind.
Had Nature been kind, and given me a heart
To flatter like you, I had mist all the smart.
But instead of Blind Cupid, kind death I request
To cure me of all Cares, and to bring me to rest
When if it is my Fortune amongst Angles to be,
I Will teach them to rail against them like me.
FINIS.
