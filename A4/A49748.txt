Henricus Laws Regiae Majestatis a sacra Musica.

TO HIS Most Sacred Majesty, CHARLES, BY THE GRACE OF GOD, King of great
Britain, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, etc.
I Could not answer mine own Conscience (most Gracious Sovereign) should I
dedicate these Compositions to any but Your Majesty; they were born and
nourished in Your Majesty's service, and long since designed (such as they are)
an Offering to Your Royal hand. Many of them were composed by my Brother (
William Laws,) whose life and endeavors were devoted to Your service;
whereof, I (who knew his heart) am a surviving witness, and therein he
persisted to that last minute, when he fell a willing Sacrifice for Your
Majesty: I were unworthy such a Brother, should I tender ought that is his, or
mine, to any but our Gracious Master (from whose Royal Bounty both of us
received all we enjoyed;) and such an Inscription would not only seem a Theft
and Alienation of what is Your Majesty's, but (which I most abhor) would make
me taste of these ungrateful days. Your Majesty knows when the Regal
Prophet first penned these Psalms, he gave them to the Musicians to be set to
tunes; and they humbly brought them to David the King. Besides, Mr. Sandys
inscribes his Translation to Your Sacred Majesty; so that this I offer is Your
Majesty's in all capacities, and does not so properly come, as rebound back to
Your Majesty. I was easily drawn to this presumption, by Your Majesty's known
particular affection to David's Psalms, both because the Psalter is held by
all Divines one of the most excellent parts of holy Scripture; as also in
regard much of Your Majesty's present condition, is lively described by King
David's pen. The King of Heaven and Earth restore Your Majesty according to
Your own righteous heart, which is the daily earnest prayer of

Your Majesty's most humble, most loyally devoted Subject and Servant, HENRY
LAWS.

To the READER.
THese following Compositions of mine and my Brothers, set at several times,
and upon several Occasions, (having been often heard, and well approved of,
chiefly by such as desire to join Music with Devotion) I have been much
importuned to send to the Press, and should not easily have been persuaded to
it now, (especially in these dissonant times) but to do a Right (or at least
to show my Love) to the Memory of my (Brother, unfortunately lost in these
unnatural Wars; yet lies in the Bed of Honor, and expired in the Service
and Defense of the King his Master. Living, he was generally known, and (for
his Parts) much honored by Persons of best quality and condition. To give a
further Character of him I shall forbear, because of my near relation, and
rather refer that to those Elegies which many of his noble Friends have
written in a peculiar Book: But, as to what he has done in Music, I shall
desire the present and the future Age, that so much of his Works as are here
published, may be received, as the least part of what he has composed, and but
a small Testimony of his greater Compositions, (too voluminous for the Press)
which I the rather now mention, lest being, as they are, dispersed into private
hands, they may chance be hereafter lost; for, besides his Fancies of the
Three, Four, Five and Six Parts to the Viols and Organ, he has made above
thirty several sorts of Music for Voices and Instruments: Neither was there
any Instrument then in use, but he composed to it so aptly, as if he had only
studied that. As for that which is my part in this Composition, I had not
thought at all (though much urged) to publish; but that, as they had their
birth at the same time with his, and are of the same kind, so they might enter
both into the light together, and accompany one another being so near allied;
Mine taking precedence of order only, not of worth. I may be thought too
partial in what I have spoke of a Brother; but here are following many of our
Friends and Fellows, (whose excellency in Music is very well known) who do
better speak for him, while they mourn his Obsequies: yet I (obliged before
all other) cannot but bewail his loss, and shall celebrate his memory to my
last hour.

Henry Laws.

To the Incomparable Brothers, Mr. Henry, and Mr. William Laws (Servants to
His Majesty) upon the setting of these Psalms.
THe various Music, both for Air and Art,
These Arch-Musicians, in their several ways
Composed, and Acted, merit higher praise
Then wonder-wanting knowledge can impart.
Brothers in blood, in Science and Affection,
Beloved by those that envy their Renown;
In a False Time true Servants to the Crown:
Laws of themselves, needing no more direction.
The depth of Music one of them did sound,
The the other took his flight into the air:
O then thrice happy and industrious pair,
That both the depth and height of Music found.
Which my sweet Friend, the life of Lovers pens,
In so mild manner has attained to do,
He looks the better, and his hearers too;
So in exchange all Ladies are his friends.
And when our Meditations are too mean
To keep their raptures longer on the wing,
They soared up to that Prophet and that King,
Whose Love is God, and Heaven his glorious Scene:
Setting his Psalms, whereby both they and we
May singing rise to immortality.
A. Tounshend.

To his Friend Mr. Henry Laws, upon his Compositions.
TO chain wild Winds, calm raging Seas, recall
From profound Hell, and raise to Heaven, are all
Of Harmony no fables, but true story;
Man has within a storm, a pain, a glory:
And these in me struck by that art divine,
Submit to Music, above all to thine.
J. Harington.

To my Friend Mr. Henry Laws.
HArry, whose tunefull and well measured song
First taught our English Music how to span
Words with just note and accent, not to scan
With Midas ears, committing short and long,
Thy worth and skill exempts thee from the throng,
With praise enough for Envy to look wan:
To after age thou shall be writ the man
That with smooth Air could humor best our tongue.
Thou honour'st Verse, and Verse must lend her wing
To honor thee, the Priest of Phoebus Quire,
That tun'st their happiest Lines in hymn or The story of Ariadne set by him
in Music.

Dante shall give Fame leave to set thee higher
Then his Casella, whom he wooed to sing,
Met in the milder shades of Purgatory.
J. Milton.

To my worthy Friend (and Countriman,) Mr. Henry Laws, upon his own, and his
Brother Mr. William Lawes's incomparable Works.
WHere shall I place my wonder, when I see
Such right in both to it, such equality
Of worth in either, that it cannot be known
Which does the greatest, and the highest own?
So when two Tapers mix their beams, we say,
Not this more luster has, or that more ray;
But each has title to the light, and they
Make up one, common, undistinguished day:
Or, as when the Flamen diverse incense fires,
The perfume severs not, but in one aspires;
So that from this Spice, or that piece of Gum,
We cannot say, such, or such odours come:
But mounting in a general unknown cloud,
The wonder of the breath's to each allowed;
So here, such equal worth from each does flow,
That to each light, to each we incense owe.
'Twas no necessity (yet) this Union made,
(As when a weaker light does droop, and fade,
Unless assisted by another) No:
Each singly could full beams and odours throw.
No wanton, ruder aires affright your ear;
They Are pious only, and chaste numbers here:
(Such was that lovely Poean, when the displeased
Incensed God the Achaick Host appeased,)
Becoming or the Temple, or the Shrine,
Fit to the words they speak; like them, divine.
Such numbers does the soul consist of, where she
Meeting a glance of her own harmony,
Moves to those sounds she hears; and goes along
With the whole sense and passion of the song;
So to an equal height, two strings being wound,
This trembles with the others stroke; and the sound
Which stirred this first, the other does awake,
And the same harmony they both partake.
Nor do they only with the soul agree
In this; they share too in its eternity:
And this, the one part of this work has tried;
For, though himself removed, this does abide,
And shall do ever: here, his memory
Shall still survive, and contemn destiny.
The same waits you (Sir) and when ever you are sent
From us, you will live here your own monument.
Fr. Sambrooke.

Henry Laws.
^THat man is truly blessed, who never strayes by false advice, nor walks in
sinners ways; nor sits infected with their scornful pride, who God contemn,
and piety deride: He shall be like the tree that spreads his root by living
streams, producing timely fruit; his leaf shall never fall: The Lord shall
bless all his endeavors with desired success, the Lord shall bless all his
endeavors with desired, desired success.

II.
Henry Laws.
^WHo trusts in thee, O let not shame deject, thou ever Just, my chased soul
secure: Lord lend a willing ear, with speed protect, be thou my rock with thy
strong arm immure.

III.

^O Thou from whom all mercy springs, compassionate my sufferings, and pity me
who trusts in thee: O shelter with thy shady wings, until these storms of woe
clear up, or o -- ver blow.

IV.
Henry Laws.
^NOt in thy wrath against me rise, nor in thy fury Lord chastise: Thy arrows

lies.

V.
Henry Laws.
^LOrd judge my cause, thy piercing eye beholds my souls inte -- grity. How
can I fall, when I, and all my hopes on thee rely? when I, and all my hopes on
thee rely.

VI.
Henry Laws.
^CAst off and scattered in thine ire, Lord on our woes with pity look: The
Lands enforced foundations shook, whose yawning ruptures sighs expire. O cure
the breaches thou have rent, and make them firmly permanent.

VII.
Henry Laws.
^THy beauty Israel is fled, sunk to the dead, sunk, etc. How are the valiant,
the valiant fallen? the slain, the slain thy mountains stain. O let it not in
Gath be known, nor in the streets of Askalon, lest that sad story should
excite their dire delight, lest in the torrent of our woe, of our woe their
pleasure flow; lest their triumphant daughters ring their Cimbals, ring their
Cimbals, ring their Cimbals, and cursed Peans sing, ring their Cimbals, and
cursed Peans sing.

VIII.
Henry Laws.
^WIth sighs and cries to God I prayed, to him my supplication made; powered
out my tears, powered out my tears, my cares and fears, my wrongs before him
laid, before him laid.

IX.
Henry Laws.
^LOrd, for thy promise sake defend, and thy all-saving shield extend. O hear
my cries, my cries, O hear my cries, which with wet eyes and sighs to thee
ascend, and sighs to thee, and sighs to thee ascend.

X.
Henry Laws.
^O Hear my cries, O hear my cries, preserve his life, who will thy Laws,
thy Laws obey, and just commands fulfill: Mine eyes out-watch the night, my
cries prevent the ear -- ly morn, in due devotion spent; hear and revive, and
revive, thy justice execute on lawless men; but thine own preserve from their
pursuit: Thy ost tried mercies ever are at hand, thy judgments on eternal
Bases stand, thy judgments, thy judgments on eternal Bases stand, on
eternal Bases stand.

XI.
Henry Laws.
^WOe is me, that I from Israel exi -- led must in Mesech dwell, and in the
tents, in the tents of Ismael. O how long shall I live with those, whose savage
minds sweet peace oppose, and fury by disswasion grows, by etc. and fury, etc.

XII.
Henry Laws.
^TO hear me Lord be thou inclined, my thoughts O ponder in thy mind, and let
my cries acceptance find: Thou hearst my morning sacrifice, to thee, before the
day star rise, my prayers ascend, my, etc. my, etc. ascend with steadfast eyes.

XIII.
Henry Laws.
^LOrd shower on us thy grace, enrich with gifts divine: Let thy illustrious
face upon thy servants shine, that all below the arched sky, may thee and thy
salvation know, salvation know.

XIV.
Henry Laws.
^HOw are the Gentiles all on fire? why rage they with vain menacings? Earths
haughty Potentates and Kings against God, against his Christ conspire: Break we
(say they) their servile bands, and cast their cords, cast their cords from our
free hands.

XV.
Henry Laws.
^HAppy he, happy he, who God obeyes, nor from his direction strayes: Thou
shall of thy labors feed, all shall to thy wish, all, etc. all shall to thy
wish succeed. Like a fair and fruitful Vine, by thy house thy wife shall
join; sons obedient to command, shall about, shall about thy table stand: Like
green plants of Olives set by the moistning Rivolet, he who fears the power
above, thus shall prosper in his love.

XVI.
Henry Laws.
^LAudate Dominum omnes Gentes: Laudate eum omnes Populi: Quoniam confirmata
est, confirmata est super nos miseri -- cor -- dia ejus, and veritas Domini
manet in aeternum, and veritas Domini manet in aeter -- number, manet in aeternum,
in aeternum, aeter -- number.

XVII.
Henry Laws.
^DEprest with grief, deprest, etc. deprest with grief, when all relief and
humane pity failed, I cried, My God, O look on me thou ever Just, thou ever
Just the afflicted free. O from the grave, O from the grave thy servant save, O
from, etc. for mercy, for mer -- cy lives in thee: O from the grave, O from the
grave thy servant save, thy servant save, for mercy lives in thee.

XVIII.
Henry Laws.
^BLest, O thrice blessed is he, O thrice, etc. whose sins remitted be; and whose
impieties God covers from his eyes, to whom his sins are not imputed as forgot,
his soul with guile unstained: while silent I remained, my bones consumed, my
bones consumed away, my bones, etc. I roared all the day, I roared all the day;
for on me day and night thy hand did heavy light: I then my sins confessed, how
far I had transgrest, when all I had revealed, thy hand, thy hand my pardon
sealed, thy hand my pardon sealed.

XIX.
Henry Laws.
^LOrd, to my prayer, to my prayer incline, incline thine ear, and thy
afflicted, afflicted servant hear; nor these salt rivers of mine eyes, these
salt rivers of mine eyes, my God despise: A stranger as my fathers were, a
stranger, etc. I sojourne here, I sojourne here. O let me gather strength
before I pass away, before I pass away, and be no more, before I pass, I
pass away, and be no more.

XX.
Henry Laws.
^WHen grief, when grief my laboring soul confounds, thou powrest balm,
thou, etc. thou powrest balm into her wounds; for thou, O Lord, art my
defense, my refuge, my refuge and my recompense: The vicious shall by vices
fall, by their own sins be swept, be swept from hence. God shall cut off their
breath, God shall cut off their breath, and give them up, and give them up to
death.

XXI.
Henry Laws.
^LEt our foes with terror quake, with terror quake; let the earths
foundation shake: Judgment our great God affects, yet with e -- quity directs,
yet with equity directs. These celestial twins embrace, these reflect on
Jacobs race: O how holy, O how holy above all honor, honor, and at his
footstool fall.

XXII.
Henry Laws.
^HOw long? Lord, how long? how long? how long, O Lord? let me not for ever be
forgot. How long? how long, my God, will thou contract thy clouded brow?
contract, etc. How long in mind perplexed shall I be daily vexed? Consider and
hear my cries, illuminate mine eyes, lest with exhausted breath I ever sleep,
I e -- ver sleep in death.

XXIII.
Henry Laws.
^ACcept my prayers, nor to the cry of my affliction stop thine ear: Lord, in
the time of misery and sad restraint, se -- rene appear; the sighing of my
spirit hear, and when I call, with speed reply.

XXIV.
Henry Laws.
^THe bounty of Jehovah praise, this God of gods all scepters swayes: Thanks to

A Pastoral Elegy to the memory of my dear Brother, William Laws.
Of 3. Voc. Bassus.
^CEase, O cease, ye jolly Shepherds, cease your merry lays; Pipe no more, in
meadows green, crowned with Ivy and with Bays: let your flocks no more be
seen on the verdant hillocks spread; but tune your oaten reeds with sadest
notes, with sadest notes to mourn: for gentle Willy, your loved Laws is ^dead.
Weep Shepherd Swains, weep Shepherd Swains, for him that was the glory of
your plains: He could appease the sullen seas, and calm the fu -- ry of the
mind; but now (alas) in silent urne he lies, hid from us, and never must
return, never, never must return, and ne -- ver must return.

^O Do not now lament and cry, O do, etc. it is Fate concludes we all must die;
rather rejoice that he is there, mending the Music of the Sphere: we are dull
souls of little worth, and coldly here his praise set forth, who does that
truly sure must be instructed by divinity. Hark, O hark, the celestial Quire
does pause to hear his sweeter Lyre: there he is set free from ^vaine fears,
or heart-heav'd sighs, or brinish tears. Could thou thy fancy send us
down, in Music we would place a crown, so harmonious on thy fair Hearse,
should out-tongue Ovid in his sweetest Verse.

By John Wilson Doctor in Music.
To the memory of his much respected Friend and Fellow, Mr. William Laws.
^BUt that, loved Friend, we have been taught, our dearest dust to mix with
dust, I Am with thy Lyre so strangely caught, my true affection counts it just,
and grounds it on a pious care, thy ashes to involve in air, involve in air:
for thy rare fancy from its birth, far inconsistent is with earth, or any
inferior element. How can dull clay press down thine eyes, and not an
earthquake straight arise?

Laws, servant to his Majesty.
Of 3. Voc. Bassus.
^NOt well? O no: Draw you black cloud, and see the soul of mine and all our
harmony drencht deep in blood and unstained loyalty, my dear Medora lies. Hard
hap to say, Time was, 'twas he; but now he is ever, ever lost to time and me. A
fatal breath of honor challenged death with death. Virtue to have a loyal
fame, a royal grave. O ^now all pour, good Will, good Will and Laws is gone,
and I forlome am come to pour my balm into his wounds, and shower these
liquid streams, until I be (dear Ghost) changed to a ghost like thee. Indeed
my springs are dry: With thy warm dew bathe his breast, for he is cold, cold
as death, cold as death, and laid to rest. Then join our woes, and let our
joys dissever, we will sing in grief, sing in grief, and drop, drop, drop,
drop our tears, and drop our tears together. ^The Muses all do mutually
assent, in this sad Dirge to erect his Monument.

Chorus of 3. ^Harmonious souls, now let your verse, with love and honor
crown his Hearse; all your spicie odours lend to the ashes of a friend: Bathe
him in a crystal flood, till you wash away the blood, till you wash away the

^BOund by the near con -- junction of our souls, thus I condole thee, thus

be, when Laws rests at such a long continued pause? Let tears, let tears,
like pendents, garnish every note, waved too and fro with gales of mournful
sighs, and let the widowed Muses jointly vote, to celebrate with ^griefe thy
Obsequies: for with thee vanished all their airie pride, muffled in clay,
muffled, etc. that erst was stellifi'd. Since then in the center sleeps true
harmony, let him (that is greedy of that sacred gain, that sacred gain,) close

^LOrd, as the Heart imbost with heat brayes after the cool Rivolet, so sighs
my soul for thee, my soul thirsts for the living God: when shall I enter his

^OFt from my early youth have they afflicted me, may Israel say, often from my

^HOw like a widow? Ah! how desolate this City sits, thrown from the pride of

Priests lament, her Priests lament, and all her sweets convert to gall, and

William Laws.
^HOw has Jehovah's wrath, O Sion, spread a veil of clouds about thy

^MY God, my rock, regard my cry, lest I unheard, like those that dye, in

Henricus Laws Regiae Majestatis a sacra Musica.

TO HIS Most Sacred Majesty, CHARLES, BY THE GRACE OF GOD, King of great
Britain, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, etc.
I Could not answer mine own Conscience (most Gracious Sovereign) should I
dedicate these Compositions to any but Your Majesty; they were born and
nourished in Your Majesty's service, and long since designed (such as they are)
an Offering to Your Royal hand. Many of them were composed by my Brother (
William Laws,) whose life and endeavors were devoted to Your service;
whereof, I (who knew his heart) am a surviving witness, and therein he
persisted to that last minute, when he fell a willing Sacrifice for Your
Majesty: I were unworthy such a Brother, should I tender ought that is his, or
mine, to any but our Gracious Master (from whose Royal Bounty both of us
received all we enjoyed;) and such an Inscription would not only seem a Theft
and Alienation of what is Your Majesty's, but (which I most abhor) would make
me taste of these ungrateful days. Your Majesty knows when the Regal
Prophet first penned these Psalms, he gave them to the Musicians to be set to
tunes; and they humbly brought them to David the King. Besides, Mr. Sandys
inscribes his Translation to Your Sacred Majesty; so that this I offer is Your
Majesty's in all capacities, and does not so properly come, as rebound back to
Your Majesty. I was easily drawn to this presumption, by Your Majesty's known
particular affection to David's Psalms, both because the Psalter is held by
all Divines one of the most excellent parts of holy Scripture; as also in
regard much of Your Majesty's present condition, is lively described by King
David's pen. The King of Heaven and Earth restore Your Majesty according to
Your own righteous heart, which is the daily earnest prayer of

Your Majesty's most humble, most loyally devoted Subject and Servant, HENRY
LAWS.

To the READER.
THese following Compositions of mine and my Brothers, set at several times,
and upon several Occasions, (having been often heard, and well approved of,
chiefly by such as desire to join Music with Devotion) I have been much
importuned to send to the Press, and should not easily have been persuaded to
it now, (especially in these dissonant times) but to do a Right (or at least
to show my Love) to the Memory of my Brother, unfortunately lost in these
unnatural Wars; yet lies in the Bed of Honor, and expired in the Service
and Defense of the King his Master. Living, he was generally known, and (for
his Parts) much honored by Persons of best quality and condition. To give a
further Character of him I shall forbear, because of my near relation, and
rather refer that to those Elegies which many of his noble Friends have
written in a peculiar Book: But, as to what he has done in Music, I shall
desire the present and the future Age, that so much of his Works as are here
published, may be received, as the least part of what he has composed, and but
a small Testimony of his greater Compositions, (too voluminous for the Press)
which I the rather now mention, lest being, as they are, dispersed into private
hands, they may chance be hereafter lost; for, besides his Fancies of the
Three, Four, Five and Six Parts to the Viols and Organ, he has made above
thirty several sorts of Music for Voices and Instruments: Neither was there
any Instrument then in use, but he composed to it so aptly, as if he had only
studied that. As for that which is my part in this Composition, I had not
thought at all (though much urged) to publish; but that, as they had their
birth at the same time with his, and are of the same kind, so they might enter
both into the light together, and accompany one another being so near allied;
Mine taking precedence of order only, not of worth. I may be thought too
partial in what I have spoke of a Brother; but here are following many of our
Friends and Fellows, (whose excellency in Music is very well known) who do
better speak for him, while they mourn his Obsequies: yet I (obliged before
all other) cannot but bewail his loss, and shall celebrate his memory to my
last hour.

Henry Laws.

To the Incomparable Brothers, Mr. Henry, and Mr. William Laws (Servants to
His Majesty) upon the setting of these Psalms.
THe various Music, both for Air and Art,
These Arch-Musicians, in their several ways
Composed, and Acted, merit higher praise
Then wonder-wanting knowledge can impart.
Brothers in blood, in Science and Affection,
Beloved by those that envy their Renown;
In a False Time true Servants to the Crown:
Laws of themselves, needing no more direction.
The depth of Music one of them did found,
The the other took his flight into the air:
O then thrice happy and industrious pair,
That both the depth and height of Music found.
Which my sweet Friend, the life of Lovers pens,
In so mild manner has attained to do,
He looks the better, and his hearers too;
So in exchange all Ladies are his friends.
And when our Meditations are too mean
To keep their raptures longer on the wing,
They soared up to that Prophet and that King,
Whose Love is God, and Heaven his glorious Scene:
Setting his Psalms, whereby both they and we
May singing rise to immortality.
A. Tounshend.

To his Friend Mr. Henry Laws, upon his Compositions.
TO chain wild Winds, calm raging Seas, recall
From profound Hell, and raise to Heaven, are all
Of Harmony no fables, but true story;
Man has within a storm, a pain, a glory:
And these in me struck by that art divine,
Submit to Music, above all to thine.
J. Harington.

To my Friend Mr. Henry Laws.
HArry, whose tunefull and well measured song
First taught our English Music how to span
Words with just note and accent, not to scan
With Midas ears, committing short and long,
Thy worth and skill exempts thee from the throng,
With praise enough for Envy to look wan:
To after age thou shall be writ the man
That with smooth Air could humor best our tongue.
Thou honour'st Verse, and Verse must lend her wing
To honor thee, the Priest of Phoebus Quire,
That tun'st their happiest Lines in hymn or The story of Ariadne set by him
in Music.
story.
Dante shall give Fame leave to set thee higher
Then his Casella, whom he wooed to sing,
Met in the milder shades of Purgatory.
J. Milton.

To my worthy Friend (and Countriman,) Mr. Henry Laws, upon his own, and his
Brother Mr. William Lawes's incomparable Works.
WHere shall I place my wonder, when I see
Such right in both to it, such equality
Of worth in either, that it cannot be known
Which does the greatest, and the highest own?
So when two Tapers mix their beams, we say,
Not this more luster has, or that more ray;
But each has title to the light, and they
Make up one, common, undistinguished day:
Or, as when the Flamen diverse incense fires,
The perfume severs not, but in one aspires;
So that from this Spice, or that piece of Gum,
We cannot say, such, or such odours come:
But mounting in a general unknown cloud,
The wonder of the breath's to each allowed;
So here, such equal worth from each does flow,
That to each light, to each we incense owe.
'Twas no necessity (yet) this Union made,
(As when a weaker light does droop, and fade,
Unless assisted by another) No:
Each singly could full beams and odours throw.
No wanton, ruder aires affright your ear;
They Are pious only, and chaste numbers here:
(Such was that lovely Poean, when the displeased
Incensed God the Achaick Host appeased,)
Becoming or the Temple, or the Shrine,
Fit to the words they speak; like them, divine.
Such numbers does the soul consist of, where she
Meeting a glance of her own harmony,
Moves to those sounds she hears; and goes along
With the whole sense and passion of the song;
So to an equal height, two strings being wound,
This trembles with the others stroke; and the sound
Which stirred this first, the other does awake,
And the same harmony they both partake.
Nor do they only with the soul agree
In this; they share too in its eternity:
And this, the one part of this work has tried;
For, though himself removed, this does abide,
And shall do ever: here, his memory
Shall still survive, and contemn destiny.
The same waits you (Sir) and when ever you are sent
From us, you will live here your own monument.
Fr. Sambrooke.
