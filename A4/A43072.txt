THE DESIGN OF GOD In the SAINTS: OR, The Spirit transporting the mind of a
Christian from the humane Nature into the divine.

In the carrying on of which Design, the Saint is a mere passive.

this is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel, saying, not by might, nor by
power, but by my spirit, says the Lord of hosts.

TO THE READER.
Courteous Reader,
I Know, that in the setting forth but of these few lines, I shall be brought
under the censure of two sorts of men; the natural, and spiritual; as for the
natural man, I look not upon him as a competent Judge here, for he knows not
the things of the Spirit, neither can he, for they are spiritually discerned,
and therefore how can he judge of those things he is ignorant of; yet I am sure
I shall not escape his censure however; but blessed be the Father, he has
taught me how to bear the hard censures, reproaches, and revilings of such men
with patience, whilst I look not at the things which are seen, but at the
things which are not seen; for the things that are seen are temporary, but the
things that are not seen are eternal; But as for the spiritual man, he
knows all things that appertains to life, and godliness; The spirit
searches the deep things of God, and reveals it unto him: so that he is a
competent Judge, Judging all things, yet he himself is judged of no man; and
therefore I am sure of his charitable censure, because he can tell how to judge
spiritually.

Now Gentle Reader, which of these two thou art, I do not know; but this I
shall desire to certify thee of, that I do not write this, to teach thee of
the Father, as to say, know him, for that is the work of the Spirit; nor to
enlighten thy understanding, for the Lord has prepared a Lamp for his
anointed, even Jesus Christ, the true light, that lightneth every man that
comes into the world; but if this may be to thee as an evidence to these
truths, as already manifested in thee, I shall much rejoice, and so I believe
thou will; for, from that short (yet sweet) experience that I have had of the
Spirit, I find it to be the nature of the Saints, (in whom it is) to rejoice
in one another light, as Solomon says, in Proverbs the 13.th verse the 9.th
The light of the righteous rejoices (...) but the lamp of the wicked shall be
put out.

The Saint who is truly spiritualized, is (as it were) overwhelmed with extreme
passions of Love, Joy, and spiritual delight in beholding the same light in
others, that is in himself; wherefore, as the Apostle John then bare record of
Christ coming in the flesh, and being made manifest in the flesh; so do I now
bare record of his coming in the Spirit, in the flesh of the Saints, and
manifesting himself unto them; and that, as the flesh of Christ died at
Jerusalem, and rose again; so does the flesh of a Saint (when Christ comes)
dye to the old Adam, and (by the power of the resurrection of Christ) live to
the new Adam, by the renewing of the mind; the Saint being once clothed with
Christ (which is his Righteousness) Mortality (that came by the fall of the
first Adam) is swallowed up of life, which is the second Adam; and so Christian
Reader, this is my earnest desire, that we may wait upon God for a further
Manifestation of himself, until he shall renew our strength; then shall we
mount up with wings as Eagles; then shall we run, and not be weary, we shall
walk, and not faint, Isaiah the 40.31.

Thine in the Bwels of love, GEORGE HASSALL.

THE DESIGN OF GOD IN THE SAINTS; OR, The Spirit transporting the mind of a
Christian from the humane nature into the Divine.
THat (which according to my apprehension of the Spirit of God) I perceive to
be his design in every one of those he intends to manifest himself unto (but
are yet in this veil of flesh) is, to transport them from flesh to Spirit,
from fleshly Egypt, where they are in bondage, to the spiritual Canaan, where
he will make them free; from Babylon in the Mystery, where they are in
Captivity, unto Jerusalem in the Mystery, where they shall be free Denizens;
from the beauty and excellency of a fleshly creature, to the beauty and
excellency of the spiritual Creator; from all worldly glory, and honor
whatsoever, to that heavenly honor, and glorious privilege, to be the sons
of God, and Coheires with Christ; (In whose presence is fullness of joy, and at
whose right hand are pleasures for evermore;) from the power of darkness unto
his mavelous light; from all outward, or imaginary worships, forms, and
carnal Ordinances, to worship him who is the true God, only in Spirit and
truth: in a word, it is to transport the mind of a Christian, or rather the
mind, which is the Christian (when spiritualized) from the humane nature of
flesh, to the divine nature of Spirit; as Paul says, Though we have known
Christ in the flesh, yeet henceforth know we him so no more, but in Spirit. And
so the Saint will say, (when he is got once to live with Christ in Spirit;) I
knew Christ (as I thought) once in those fleshly dispensations (or outward
means, as some call them) but henceforth I shall desire to know him no more so
but in Spirit, as I do. The Saint being baptized with that one Baptism (not
the putting away the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good Conscience
toward God) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ, ( Peter the first, the third,
and the 21.) knows Christ to be in him, that heavenly Manna, the bread of
life, and to be in him a Vine yielding fruit, and to be in him a well of water
springing up unto eternal life; Paul says, that in the ministration of bread
and wine, they did but hold forth the Lords death till he came; And when
Christ, which was the substance, was come, then the shadow was to be done away;
they were not to retain the shadow with the substance, and therefore says the
Apostle Paul in Colossians the 2.d and the 16. Let no man therefore judge you
in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy day, or of the new Moon, or of
the Sabbath days: which are a shadow of things to come, but the body is of
Christ.

When a man is newborn of the Spirit, he is then a new bottle, a vessel of
honor fit for his masters use. Now says Christ, Men do not put old wine into
new bottles, but new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved; New
spiritual wine is most fit for that Saint that is new spiritualized.
Wherefore, if he be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why as
though living in the world, should he be subject to ordinances, as the Apostle
says in Colossians the 2.d and the 20.th and in Galathians the 4.th he says
to them, But now after ye have known God, or rather are known of God; how turn
ye again to the weak and beggarly elements whereunto ye desire again to be
in bondage. As if he should say, in that Chapter, as long as ye were under that
low dispensation of ordinances, ye were but (as servants) under Tutors and
Governors; but now is the appointed time of the Father come to make you free,
and therefore he has sent forth his Spirit of Adoption into your hearts,
whereby you cry Abba, Father; and now that you are no more servants but
sons, why do you not keep you so? Why do you look back upon those worldly
elements, as if you had a desire to be again in bondage to them.

The Apostle in the same Chapter confesses, that his first coming unto them,
and preaching of the Gospel, was through infirmity of the flesh; (being then
under a low fleshly dispensation) and yet they despised him, not, but received
him, as if he had been Christ himself; but now that he comes to preach unto
them, in a ministration above Ordinances, a dispensation of the Spirit, by
which they should be made free (poor man!) he is become their enemy, as he
there complains. But why Paul art thou become their enemy now, that not long
since wast so great in their books? because I endeavor to draw them off from
fleshly ordinances, and the Elements of the world, (that by nature are no Gods)
by preaching unto them the mystery of godliness; Christ manifest in the
flesh, not only Christ which is dead, but rather Christ which is risen in us,
the hope of glory; but they are so fast glewed to their forms, that they
cannot endure sound doctrine, and therefore they look upon me as their enemy.
Thus is Paul looked upon as an enemy, (by those that formerly would have plucked
out their eyes, and have given them unto him, to do him good) because he tells
them the truth, and came not unto them in the same ministration that he
formerly came to them in, but in a higher and more spiritual; and yet says
Paul sweetly to them in the 19. and 20. verses, My little children, of whom I
travail again in birth, until Christ be formed in you; I desire to be
present with you now, and to change my voice, for I stand in doubt of you.

See now this blessed Apostle, after that Christ was formed in him, and that he
was brought up to live in the third Heaven, in Spirit, how earnest and desirous
is he to have all those (that formerly he had society with, and had preached the
Gospel through infirmity unto) to have the like spiritual enjoyment in them,
and to be brought up to the same perfection and unity of the Spirit with
himself. Now that Paul was made a partaker of the divine naturre, he could as
well comprehend the Sea in the hollow of his hand, as conceal it; the divine
nature is love; (God is love,) and here you might see this nature in Paul; for
after he knew the oneness and unity of the Saints with the Father, he must
make it known unto them, and yet they keep close to their old forms, and will
not hear him, because they think he is fa^^er from his first principles, and
is led away from his former profession, with the errors of the wicked thinking
it strange, that whilst they are in this veil of flesh, they should be so
translated into the Image of God, as to worship him in such a spiritual manner
above Ordinances; but here was the difference between them and Paul, Christ
being formed in him, and manifested unto him, as the substance of all these
shadows; he did (by what he apprehended of him) see the vanity of the one, and
the glory and excellency of the other; comparing spiritual things, with his
spiricualized understanding; and therefore he says, My little children, of
whom Itravell in birth again, until Christ be formed in you. And know ye
not, that except Christ be in you, ye are Reprobates. And in other place;
Stand fast in the Liberty wherewith Christ has made you free, and be not
entangled again with the yoke of bondage.

But as the Jews thought that Christ spoke of the Temple at Jerusalem that
Solomon built, when he spoke of his body; and as Nicodemus thought that Christ
had spoken of a natural birth, when he spoke of a spiritual; so did these men
unto whom Paul writ, (comparing spiritual things to their natural and carnal
understandings) think that he spoke of a natural man, when he spoke of the
spiritual; they thought that he had spoken of natural freedom, when indeed
he spoke of a spiritual freedom, such as he enjoyed when he was in the
stocks, the enjoyment thereof being then so gladsome, so joyous and sweet unto
him, that it made him sing for joy of heart; as God says in the last of Isaiah
but one, when he was in bonds, he was yet free; and so shall all the Saints of
God, whose lot and portion it is, or shall be, to be persecuted for the
testimony of Christ their head; Whosoever believes in him, shall not be
ashamed: the Father will uphold them with the right hand of his Righteousness.
It is now the weakness of many in our days to think, that because they do
not apprehend God in themselves, therefore he is not in them, and because that
they are not able to comprehend the Father, that therefore he is not able to
comprehend himself in them; thinking, that he dispences himself unto his
Saints while they are here, only by shadows, and not in substance; by these
outward means (as they call it) hearing and reading, and preaching, and Bread
and Wine, and not in Spirit; when for my own part I find it nothing so, as I
must needs say: and if you shall ask me what comfort I had, or supportance,
when I was under those Administrations; truly I must needs confess, I then
thought that my greatest comfort in this world, was in those ordinances;
whereas I now find, (as Jacob said) that of a truth it was God within me that
supported and conforted me, and I knew it not, because I did not then apprehend
him; the appointed time of the Father was not come to make me free, and while I
was a servant, it was not meet that I should know what my Lord did; but (now
blessed for ever be his name) I have heard his sweet still voice within me,
saying, Henceforth call I thee no more a servant, but my friend; the servant
knows not what his Lord does, but all that I have heard of the Father will I
declare unto thee. It is now my work in thee to dispell those clouds of fleshly
lusts, that have a long time harbored in thee, and been the veil that has
all this time hindered thee from beholding my glory in spirit; I am the new
Adam, the second Adam, I will sit in thee as a refiners fire, and as fullers
soap; I will take away all thy dross and tin. Lo, I create a new heaven, and
a new earth in thee, and the first heaven, and the first earth shall pass
away; The first Adam with all his glory and splendour, which has hitherto been
thy heaven, it shall vanish away; and the second Adam (which after God is
created in righteousness and true holiness) must take place; and in that new
heaven, and new earth that I create in thee, there shall dwell Righteousness;
It is I friend, that am that righteousness, that will dwell in thee, and make
mine abode with thee; nay, I will sup with thee, and thou shall sup with me,
and I will impart of the divine nature unto thee; As the Father has given to
me of the Spirit freely, so will I give unto thee, and thou shall partake
thereof; thou shall see thy self to live in, and by me, thou shall see thy
self to have thy being and spiritual subsistence in me, I am that bread of
life, and that water of life; our of thy belly shall flow rivers of living
water. I will destroy in thee every evil thought, and high imagination that
exalts in self against me; for now is the judgment of this world in thee,
now shall the Prince of this world be cast out, sin shall have no more
dominion over thee; for I will so manifest my self unto thee, that thou shall
no more lust after, nor be in love with any thing below me; as thou shall
apprehend me in Spirit, all thy legal Righteousness shall appear to thee but
as a menstruous rag, and therefore wait thou upon me, until I accomplish this
my work in thee: for in the doing of it thou shall be a mere passive, but when
it is finished, that I have once translated thee into my Image, the shall thou
bring forth fruit, suitable to the stock you are graffed into; yea, thou shall
be so clothed with fine linen, clean and white, that thou shall not in the
least be found naked. Mortality shall be swallowed up of life; and thou shall
give thanks unto him, who has given thee the victory through thy Lord Jesus
Christ.

And as it is my meat and drink to do the will of my father, so shall it be
thine: for I will transport thy mind, thy heart, and affections from all
earthly things whatsoever (though it have appeared unto thee formerly never so
glorious,) unto heavenly, divine, and spiritual things, that shall never
vanish away; it shall be more glorious, yea, more sweet unto thy taste then the
honey or the honey comb; it shall be more precious unto thee then the gold of
Ophir.

Blessed be the Lord, I find that he has already (in some measure) so taken
me up above fleshly, and carnal things, that I only wait upon him for a
further and fuller manifestation of himself in me, according to his promise;
for I know that the Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count
slacknesse; I know that his coming draws nigh; he that shall come, will come,
and will not tarry; and though that in outward ordinances, I was once busy and
active, yet I find that in the inward and spiritual workings within me, I was
then (yea and am still) a mere passive; and therefore (according to my
apprehension) we must know, that in the transportation of a Christian, out of
the humane nature into the divine, he is a mere passive, and not active at
all, until he partake of the divine nature, and then, as it is the divine
nature of the Spirit to be active in searching the deep things of God, and
declaring it to him, so is it a divine nature in the Spirit (likewise) to make
the mind active in spiritual things, and in declaring unto others, what God
has manifested of himself in him; That as the Father is, so is he in this
present world, the 1. of John the 4.th and the 17.th but this we are not able
to apprehend whilst we are in the body, being absent from the Lord, or whilst
we are in low fleshly dispensations, being absent from the spiritual, which is
beyond humane sense, or common reason; For as is the earthy, such are they that
are earthy, and as is the heavenly, such are they that are heavenly: when we
are once translated into his heavenly Image, then we shall see as we are seen,
and know as we are known.

For as he is perfect, so are we, with one and the same perfection; and as he
is holy, so are we, with one and the same holiness; and as he is righteous, so
are we, with one and the same righteousness; Christ is the Lord our
righteousness, as well as the Fathers; (only we want a fuller manifestation of
it, which we must wait for) he is that lamp that the Father has prepared for
his Anointed, to be a Lantern unto their feet, and a light unto their paths;
whilst we are in the humane and natural condition, there is a strong man armed
(which is our lusts, armed with a desire of worldly riches, honor, and
pleasures,) keeps the house (which is the mind) and for a while the things
that he enjoys are in peace, until the stronger then he comes (which is
Christ) and dispossesseth him of the mind (taking it off from doting on the
world) and takes possession himself, and makes it his Temple, his house of
prayer, and whips out all the buyers and sellers out of it; he will no longer
suffer a den of thieves to harbor there, but takes it up for his own
habitation, and there he sits, as a Refiners fire, and as Fullers soap,
purifying, and cleansing us as gold, and silver, that we may offer unto the
Lord, an offering in Righteousness, in all which the Creature is a mere
passive still; Christ alone, who is wonderful in Council, and excellent in
working; his arm alone brings salvation to him, and his righteousness it
sustaineth him; and therefore says the Saints, this is the Lords doing, and it
is wonderful in our eyes; So that I say, the Christian in the various workings
of God in him (which is the drawing him up, from one dispensation which is low,
unto another, that is higher, and so from one dispensation to another, until
he take him up above all, to live in Spirit with himself) does not in the
least, help, or assist, but is a mere passive in it, though he think himself
active in it, by following of good duties, which is only bodily exercise, and
profits little, as the Apostle says: but being once brought up into the
nature of Spirit, he is then active in spiritual exercises; all his sacrifices
that he offers to the Father are spiritual, he can offer no other; and such
only are well pleasing to the Father, as are offered in the Son, For in him
alone he is well pleased. God accepts not of any duty, or performance
whatsoever, though never so zealous, that is not done, and acted in, and by
Christ himself, to the Father, from the new Creature, which in us is borne of
the freewoman, and not of the bondwoman; of the Spirit, and not of the flesh;
as Christ himself said, that God is a Spirit; so he said, that they that
worship him, must worship him in Spirit and in truth, which is Christ himself.
He is the way, the truth and the life; In him we live, move, and have our
being; in him we are active, and, except we abide in him we can do nothing; as
he says in John the 15. ver. the 5.th I am the vine, ye are the branches, he
that abides in me, and I in him, the same brings forth much fruit; for
without me ye can do nothing; So that when a man is borne again, when he is
brought up to live with Christ, in the unity and oneness of that ever blessed
Spirit of himself, he is then active, and brings forth much fruit: he is
then no more a servant, (as he was before) but a friend, The servant (says
Christ) knows not what his Lord does, but I have called you friends: for all
things that I have heard of my Father, I have made known unto you. He keeps
nothing back from the Saints, because they are his friends: and he has chosen
them, and ordained them, that they should bring forth fruit, and that their
fruit shall remain, says the Apostle Paul in the first of the Corinths, and
the last ver. But we all with open face, beholding as in a glass the glory of
the Lord, are changed into the same Image from glory to glory, even as by the
Spirit of the Lord; Where you may take notice, that this change in a Christian
is wrought by the Spirit: this Spirit as a glass, is that, in which we behold
the glory of the Lord; at the sight of which precious and beautiful aspect, we
are so enamored therewith, that there is a present change wrought in us; our
minds and affections are by the Spirit transported from all the glory, beauty,
and excellency of the old Creation (that is under the Sun, (that as Solomon
said) we behold them all to be but vanity and vexation of Spirit) unto the
glory, beauty, and excellency of the new Creation, which is above the natural
Sun; even Righteousness, and peace, and Joy in the holy Ghost. A Saint having
no sooner found this one Pearl of so great price, but he goes presently, and
sels all that he has, and buys it; when he is once borne of water, which is
the Spirit, such is the powerful operation of it, that it works a Saint into
its own nature, as fire is said to do wood; The law of this Spirit of life, is
that which frees us from the Law of sin and death, it makes us free of that
City, the new Jerusalem that comes down from God out of heaven, and indeed is
in all the Saints, and the Saints in it, that live in this Spirit; they have no
need of the light of the Sun, nor the light of the Moon; (which is the light
of the first Adam, and his glory) but the Lord God shall enlighten them, and
the Lamb shall be their light, which is the second Adam, and his glory: for as
the first Adam was a type or shadow of the second; so all those Types, and
Ordinances, and the Law in the letter (as given in Moses Administration) though
the very light and glory of the first Adam, (by which we only know good and
evil) yet, but a shadow of the light and glory of the second Adam, by which we
not only know the will of God, but are happy in doing of it; The old man knows
his Masters will, but does it not, because he is weak; but the new man, he is
strong, it is his meat and drink to do the will of his Father.

When the Saint does come to behold the glory of God in Spirit, to enlighten
him, and the Lamb to be his light, by which he sees his unity and oneness with
the Father, and the Son he then comes to the true knowledge of the Son of God,
and grows up to a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness
of Christ, as it is in Ephesians the 4. and the 12. so that when the Saints
come to have the enjoyment of that everlasting light spoken of in the 60.th of
Isaiah, They shall be so rooted and grounded in him, that they shall not be
tossed to and fro with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men, and
cunning craftines, whereby they lie in wait to deceive men, and therefore said
Christ, If it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect: but the Saints
having once the enjoyment of this light, it is impossible that ever they should
be deceived; for they are borne of the Spirit, and are Spirit; now the
spiritual man judges all things, yet he himself is judged of no man; he
cannot be seduced by false Prophets, that shall say, lo, Christ is in this
form, and lo, Christ is in that form; he believes them not, because the Son
of Righteousness is already risen in him, with healing under his wings; the
Day Star, Christ Jesus, is arisen in him; Christ will in no wise suffer the
wicked one to touch him: For he has desired him for his habitation, Psalm. 132.
ver. the 13. and there he dwells, and keeps possession in him, and where is a
stronger then he to turn him out? Shall the gates of Hell prevail against
him? no, nor the Dragon neither; our Michael will take a course to overthrow
them, and leave of them, neither root, nor branch in the Saint, but will keep
him as the apple of his eye, which cannot behold iniquity. Mark what Christ
says (in the 60. of Isa. and verse 17.) unto the Saints, or the Church, For
brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver, and for wood
brass, and for stones iron: I will also make thy officers peace, and thine
exactors Righteousness. What a sweet promise is here of Christ, with some
expressions which hold forth to us his more excellent and exceeding glory in
coming, then in the coming of the first Adam; did the first man bring brass
with him? why, Christ will bring for that gold; did the first man bring a
fleshly Administration? 06 why, the second man is the Lord from Heaven,
heavenly; he will bring a more heavenly and spiritual administration to the
Saint, when he manifests himself unto him.

But least I should here be mistaken, I desire the Reader to take notice, that
what I call the Saint, or Christian, is not menat by me, man, as he is by
nature visible to the natural eye; but that which I call the Saint, is the
mind of a man, translated by the Spirit into the Image of God, or taken off
from the fleshly glory of creature, to look upon, and affect the spiritual
glory of the Creator, as is before expressed; that is it which I call the
Saint: for says Paul, I thank God, that with my mind I serve God, though
with the flesh I serve sin: the mind sanctified is the Saint, and so Paul
was a Saint, and so the mind being taken up by Christ from the humane nature
of flesh, into the divine nature of Spirit, and translated into his Image or
likeness, is properly said to be a Christian, or new creature; so that there
is a clear difference between the law of the members (in such a man) and the
law of his mind, for the law of his member, as Paul said, is always warring,
and rebelling against the law of his mind, and is what which sometime carries him
away captive to sin: Wherefore it is not the might of the Presbyter, nor the
power of the Magistrate, either in constraining, or in restraining, that can
make a Saint; it is not their forms and ordinances that can any more bring a
man to the spiritual Canaan, then Moses could bring the children of Israel to
the temporal Canaan, he must be dead before they come there; it is not all the
powers in the world that can transport the mind of a man from the humane
nature into the divine, (till when, he is neither a Christian, nor a Saint) but
the Lord Jesus Christ and the power of his might; it is the Spirit of the Lord
of Hosts that shall make the great Mountain become a Plain before Zerubbable,
it is he that has laid the foundation, and it is he that shall come and finish
it; wherefore I shall conclude with that saying of James, in chapter the 5.
verse the 7. and 8. Be patient therefore brethren, to the coming of the Lord,
Behold the husbandman waits for the precious fruit of the earth, and has
long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain; Be ye also
patient, stablish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord draws nigh.

FINIS.
