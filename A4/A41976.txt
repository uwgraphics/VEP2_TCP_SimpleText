The Greeks and Trojans Wars.
Caused by that Wanton Knight, Sir Paris,
Who ravishes Hellen, and her to Troy carries;
The Greeks in revenge (and to fetch her again)
A mighty great army do quickly ordain:
Imagine you see them besiedging old Troy,
Which after ten years they at the last destroy.
With a Fit allusion, before the Conclusion.
Tune is, A conscionable Caviat.




Of Greece and Troy I shall you tell,
What cruel Wars betwixt them fell;
Paris was Author of the same,
For plundring of the Grecian Dame:
he ravished her,
and to Troy brought her,
this you know,
but that short measure,
of fond pleasure,
Caused great Ilimus overthrow.
For when the Grecians heard the same,
Their hearts with ire began to flame;
They counsel took and did decree,
To raise an Army speedily,
to fetch that peecs.
fair Hellen of Greece,
back again:
or else the gallant,
Grecians valiant,
By the Tr^jans must b(...)in.
Achilles he was in disguise,
When first he heard of this enterprise;
He Lady like, with a Lady lay,
Until her belly did them both bewray;
away fond Lass,
for I from hence must pass,
unto Troy:
but her note still is,
dear Achilles,
Stay with me my only joy.
While thou be gone and leave me so,
Unto the Trojan Wars to go,
If thou with me wilt stay behind,
Here thou shall entertainment find,
fond fool avoid,
for I must be employed,
out of hand:
for the enraged,
Greeks engaged,
All march under my command.
The second Part,
to the same Tune.

MY dear Achilles, then said she,
Alas, what shall become of me;
My heart thy love has set on fire,
I gave to thee what thou did desire?
vaunt foolish Girl,
bright honor is the pearl
I must seek:
wanton courting,
idle sporting,
Fits not now a valiant Greek.
Thou know Sweetheart I am with child,
Thy flattering tongue has me beguiled;
Why then from me will thou depart,
And leave my breast without a heart:
cease complement,
for now my mind is bent
other ways:
such enjoyment
is employment,
Fit for sole peaceful days.
Ulisses would seem mad cause he
Would stay with his Penelope:
But no illusions must take place,
Though millions die for one fair face;
it shall be seen,
their Lacedemons Queen,
whom that Boy
violated,
shall be rated
At the price of Greece or Troy.
If Sir (said she) one face has force
To raise so many foot and horse;
Why may not mine, prais^d often by you,
Have power to keep what is my due?
plead not thy face,
their's difference in the case
very great?
our Monarchal
light, were dark all,
Should we wink at this defeat,
Let noble Britains notice take,
Of this allusion which i will make:
Imagine all the power of Greece,
To fetch great Agamemnons Niece:
are sacking Troy,
which they at last destroy
utterly:
they will fetch her,
from her Letcher
By all this extremity.
Ireland is our Hellen fair.
Ravished from us, through want of care;
The Paris that has done this rape,
Is fond security (that Ape)
as now you hear,
Achilles with his dear
will not stay:
If Mars summon,
no fond Woman
Can a Soldiers soul betray.
So let brave English Soldiers seek,
For President that gallant Greek,
Let Us leave our toys, which slaves retard,
And to our honor have regard:
Ireland does shake
our honor at the stake
lies engaged:
it is our Heilen
stolen by a Villain,
Fall on him like Greeks enraged,
Let all homebred strife alone,
And as the Greeks all joined in one,
Their loss and honor to repair,
Let their examples be our care,
and never leave,
until that we receive
for our pains,
death or honor,
when we have won her,
We shall find sufficent gains.
FINIS.
