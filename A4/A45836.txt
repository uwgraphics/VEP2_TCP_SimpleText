Printed in the Year, 1664.

ONE TRVMPET more sounded out of SION to the Inhabitants of the Earth, which
they may take as a Warning for them for to let ISRAEL go and Worship their God
after their wonted manner, or else Destruction will the Lord bring upon them
Eternally.
HEAR and fear oh Earth, and hearken what the Lord says; Thus says the Lord,
How long will you persist in wickness and not forsake the evil of your ways;
what is there found in you oh ye Inhabitants of the earth, is not the
iniquities of your fathers found amongst you; Oh what manner of evil was there
in your fathers days which you are not found in, shall you not receive the
reward of your fathers who has killed the PROPHETS and MARTYRS of JESUS, will
not the blood of all the Prophets from ABEL to this day be required at your
hands.

YEA verily, and this do I declare in your ears; Oh ye Inhabitants of the
earth, that ye may be once more warned and tremble before the God of JACOB, who
will consume the wicked and deliver the captives out of BABYLON by a way which
you know not; for verily the arm of the Lord is stretched forth to deliver his
poor afflicted Israel, who is afflicted with the tasks of the EGYPTIANS, and
have long groaned under their burdens.

BUT the Lord has heard their cries, and deliverance will he bring in despite
of PHARAOH and all his host, for destruction and desolation will he bring upon
you.

HEAR ye this ye old men, and give ear all ye Inhabitants of the land, tremble
and fear for the day of the Lord is at hand, a day of darkness and gloomyness a
day of clouds and of thick darkness, such as never was before, WOE WOE, from
the Lord God unto the Inhabitants of the earth, who has slighted the groans of
SION, and have oppressed the righteous seed, and does not at all remember the
afflictions of JOSEPH, but rather oppresses the afflicted.

BUT for these things will the Lord render unto you vengeance except you
repent, for his Decree is against you to destroy you.

THEREFORE I say unto you all in the fear and dread of the Lord God (who have
been fighters against the Lord) that you now repent before your time be wholly
spent, and cleave to the light of the Lord Jesus, and then will the Lord
receive you and give you an inheritance with the faithful, who are as dear unto
him as the Apple of his eye, and cannot bear the afflictions of them, though he
suffers longer for the trial of his people, yet this know that he will roar out
of SION with a dreadful noise, by which the powers of the earth shall be made
to tremble, and bow before him, for his appearrance is dreadful to the wicked,
and who can abide the day of his coming.

AND in that day will he be a swift witness against the Sorcerers, and against
Idolaters, and false Swearers; and those who oppress the heritage of God, which
is poor afflicted ISRAEL which has long been oppressed by the baser sort of
people, as PAUL was in his day; unto which truth we bear Testimony too, for
PAUL was assaulted when he came to the House of JASON and cried against by the
baser sort, (these are they which have turned the world up side down, and will
not obey the Decrees of CAESAR, but says there is another King one JESUS; and
this was the cry in all Ages against the truth of God as well as in this our
Age (as we may read in the Scriptures of truth, by the Sorcerers, and
Idolaters, and false Swearers; but the Lord delivered his people and destroyed
them all.

THEREFORE howl, howl, ye uncircumcised, mad, raging Bulls, for misery will be
your end; for the cry of the Righteous is entered into the ears of the Lord of
the Sabbath, and a Record of all your doings is standing before the great God
of the whole earth, who will judge the WHORE, BEAST, and false PROPHET, and
cast them alive into the Lake which burns with fire and brimstone forever.

AND this do I declare unto you who have the name of Christians, but are out of
the nature as the professing JEWS was in Christ's days, who professed the
Scriptures which bore Testimony of Christ; but when he came they persecuted him
and put him to death, but these were JEWS outwardly and not inwardly, they had
the name of JEWS as you have the name of Christians, but far from Christians
nature; For Christ came not to destroy men's lives, but to save them.

THEREFORE I say as you tender the good of your own Souls cease from your
cruelty and oppression, and let ISRAEL go free, who would only pass through your
Country, or else you shall be as stubble, And the day that comes shall burn
you up, and leave you neither root nor branch says the Lord of host.

J. I.

AND ALSO A FEW words by way of Expostulation with the Spirit of CAIN, and all
that are found in it, and what was CAINS portion in that day, and also what
will be the portion of these persecutors who are Successors of CAINS Spirit,
and persecuteth about Sacrifice and Worship in this our day.
HOw now CAIN? what is the matter thou art so wroth, what is not thy offering
accepted that thou fallest out and killest thy Brother, what do thou intend,
or what is the cause of thy wroth; surely it is because thy Brothers sacrifice
is accepted, and thine rejected: but CAIN why art thou so wroth if thou do
well, shall not thou be accepted; but if thou do ill sin lies at the door,
and the hand of the Lord shall depart from thee, and thou shall be a vagabond
and a fugitive in the earth, and all that meet thee shall slay thee, because
thou have departed from the Lord in shedding the blood of the Righteous about
sacrifice and worship; and now CAIN sad and miserable is thy state, for thou
art driven out from the presence of the Lord; and it is thy sin that has
separated between thee and thy God, for the blood of the righteous cries for
vengeance, and assuredly it will be speedily executed upon the heads of the
transgressors who thus fights with CAINS Spirit in this our day against them
whom the Lord has raised up to offer a sweet sacrifice which is accepted of
him; and because of this thou CAIN art wroth, and by thy persecuting with long
imprisonments even unto death, the righteous thou think to overcome, or by
thy acts for banishment; but CAIN that will not do, its not thy acts which will
affright them nor drive them from the Lord, or the enjoyments of his presence;
for CAIN its neither walls nor Seas which can separate them from the presence
of their God which they now enjoy, but its thy sin CAIN which has separated
between thee and thy God.

SURELY CAIN if thou had offered sacrifice which had been righteous, would
not the Lord have accepted it; Yes sure, then what need would there have been
to persecute about it, but CAIN thy sacrifice is unclean and not accepted,
therefore thou art wroth and persecutest thy Brother, which is an infallible
token against thee that thou art out of the truth CAIN, because thou art found
persecuting and killing about sacrifice and worship, those that cannot for
Conscience sake bow to any graven image, which thou CAIN have set up to be
worshipped in thy fallen and driven out state from the presence of God; and
this is the cause CAIN why thou persecutest them, because they cannot bow to
the likeness of any thing, but will worship their God in spirit and truth.
Surely CAIN thy punishment is great; for to thy offering the Lord will have no
respect, because thou have killed thy Brother, whose blood cries for
vengeance; well CAIN if thou believe its lawful for to kill and banish all
that cannot for fear of grieving God bow unto thy image which thou have set up:
Then give us an instance where ever Christ and any of his APOSTLES banished
those that would not come to their worship; which was in the Spirit and in the
truth, surely CAIN thou have no Scripture from Christ or any of his Apostles
for it, neither can thou give any instance from them by any Scripture nor any
other of, the true Prophets, except thou go to ISHMAEL, PHARAOH and HEROD,
who successes thy spirit CAIN for HEROD sought the young Child's life, and
PHARAOH persecuted the Children of Israel till the hand of the Lord turned
against him and drowned them all in the SEA; and this was about sacrifice and
worship which thou CAIN art found in, surely CAIN, our God is the same that
ever he was, he changes not; surely he will recompense thee according to thy
doings, as well as he did HEROD, PHARAOH, and ISHMAEL, for that spirit of
persecution; but Cain, what have thou done by all thy long imprisonments or by
thy acts of banishment, have thou turned any from the evil of their ways as
Christ and his Apostles did: who won them by sound Doctrine, no none, but on
the contrary thou would cause them to blaspheme by thy instruments of
cruelty; but for these things is thy day shortened, which is for the Elect sake,
and a remnant shall be preserved unto God pure and undefiled, standing upon the
rock on which thou shall be split, and upon the sand shall thou stick and never
remove again, for the mouth of the Lord of hosts has spoken it.

Given forth from the true fear and dread of the Lord God, by one who now
suffers under CAIN, PHARAOH, and HEROD'S Spirit, for the Testimony of Jesus
which is the word of God.

AND now you persecutors who have this Book to Read,
Consider it well, for your portion it is indeed;
That have thus fought against the living God,
Who will confound the wicked with his Rod:
And you shall feel the stroke of his own hand,
Who strives to make his chosen dear forsake their native land.
Wisbech Goal the 14th day of the 6th Month 1664. JOHN IVES.
