THE King of Poland's LAST SPEECH To His COUNTRYMEN
I Know, you hope all once to be
Great Men of Note and Majesty;
For this our now Supremacy
Is Nonsense.
Why should one Man for ever sway
A Scepter, (who is but made of Clay?)
Why may not we our selves obey
In Conscience?
But now it is come, Alas, we see,
That all our Fame turns Infamy:
Ah! such a thing is Policy
With Tories
The buzzing Jealousies and Fears,Into the Peoples listening Ears,
For all those many busy years,
Are Stories.
Since in late Plots w' have gone astray,
It Is time to look another way,
And not in such a Case delay;
It Will harm us.
No doubt, you have heard of Forty-One,
Of all the Prancks that then were done,
And of the happy Conquest won:
Let Us arm us;
And play those very Cards again,
For all those Ancients were but Men;
Five Israelites may well beat Ten
Philistines.
Let Us cry Oppression through the Town,
Oppression of the Court and Gown,
And raise in Tumult every Clown,
to Listings.
We'll first expose the Laws to Shame,
And next the Loyal Part defame;
If Good or Bad, they are all the same,
No odds make.
Yet let Religion be the Word,
To shade Rebellion and the Sword;
Then play the Devil under board,
For God's-sake.
Then be not wanting in your Lies;
In Plots and Shams, and Forgeries;
To blind the weak and gazing Eyes,
With Fables.
But if you would enjoy the Land,
Let the dark Roman join his Hand,
He Force and Council can command
In Caballs.
Which though it seem as strange as Nile,
It Is Lawful to unite in Guile;
Our Intrest's never the worse that while,
But further.
For all their Principles are mine;
Their Tricks to guild a black Design;
Their Warrants to unite and join
In Murder.
What if you were not born to Land,
Or to be Persons in Command;
It Is never the worse at second Hand,
But Fashion.
Is it not base (a Curse) to see,
When we should all live equally,
Such odds and such Majority
In The Nation.
And though we find no fault in State,
Or any other Potentate;
Yet those great Names will raise debate,
And wroth, Sirs.
Since then it will be so good a Feate.
Let Us once (for all) the Work complete
For nothing else can make us Great,
In troth, Sirs.
My Optics (Friends) almost can see
A new formed Lump of Anarchy;
Whilst under foot lies Monarchy,
And hated.
Methinks I see those very Men,
I hate and envy, once again,
From many Thousands unto Ten,
Abated.
Ah! sweet Revenge, and bold Ambition,
Infects both Us, and half the Nation;
The cause of Wife Association
So lately:
And well't may plague us all, to see
Some, though no better Men than We,
To live in Pomp for Loyalty,
So stately.
I knew when once the Good Old Cause
Was named aloud with great Applaue:
Blessed Times for Liberty! No Laws,
To fright all:
Therefore, if once it come to Test,
And we again with Laurel blessed,
The Stronger Side must be the best,
At Whitehall.
And if all Lords you chance to be,
Who knows what Hell designs for me?
We Will make our Lives one Jubilee,
And Wonder.
So being out of Breath, and spent;
Alas, (said he) much more is meant.
At last (with Pox) he hurrying went;
Like Thunder.
