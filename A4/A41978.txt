Good Council and Advice Unto All PROFESSORS
In whom there is any tenderness and breathings after the Lord, and the
knowledge of his way.

By one that has in the Light of the LORD seen through them all, into the
restingplace that is prepared for them that truly fear the Lord.

Hear all you Professors of the Towns of Northampton and Hardingstone, you
whose Profesion is waxed old as a Garment; Hearken you that border about them,
and are thereunto adjoining, listen as you that are Inhabitants, for unto you
it does belong.

THE only true God that framed the Heavens, and laid the Foundations of the
Earth, that created and made mankind in his own likeness, has looked down from
Heaven, and has beheld and seen how mankind is degenerated and fallen from
that estate in the which he was made and brought forth, and has committed the
two great abominations in forsaking the living Fountain and Wellspring of
life, and dug to themselves broken Cisterns that will hold no water: And now
the only wise God has decreed a Decree, and determined a Determination, and
purposed a Purpose that must stand; which is to try all sorts of people and
professors under what name or title soever they may be known or called, that
the Bearer may be known from the Hearer, and the Sayer from the Doer. And now
awake, awake, awake, Arise all you professors, come forth, and lay aside all
your Fig-leafed garments, and all your high notions of words, and come to the
Word that is ingrafted, which is able to save the soul that is immortal, that
has lain low, and has been oppressed under all this Profession, which has
not enjoyed the invisible Life, which only this could satisfy: And now it
slandeth every one in hand, diligently to search, and truly to try and examine
themselves whether they be in the Faith that gives victory over the World, the
which slandeth in the Power of God, Christ Jesus the Light of the World, who is
the Rock of Ages, the sure Foundation upon which the holy men of God (in ages
and generations past) were built, and their Faith, Hope and Confidence was in
him only; and so every one is to come to him which was the Rock of Ages and
Generations past, and is the Rock of this present Age; and blessed are they
that are built thereupon: For verily professors, you that have built, and are
yet building with Hey, Straw and Stubble, which will not abide the fire, but
with it are to be burned up, and there shall be none found to quench it;
therefore every one before you again begin to build, try what you build upon;
for in vain, and to no purpose will it be for you to build upon that which has
not been tried: And come out of these changeable things, and out of all those
noises, and crying up one thing for truth one while, and then for another time
throw it down again, and say it was Erroneous, Superstition and Popery, and
such like, and was to be abolished and disannulled, and now cry the same up for
Truth again: But now come and wait upon the Lord, and come into that in which
there is no variableness nor shadow of turning, that when you are turning to
the right hand, or to the left, the still small Voice you may come to hear,
saying, This is the way, walk in it; the Voice that calls for Purity, and
(out of profaneness) for Equity, and to do unto all men as you would that they
should do unto you: And though for a long time the Light has shone in your
dark hearts, and has often times reproved you in secret when you did do, or
speak that which you ought not to have acted or spoken; yet this I say, turn,
turn to that which reproves you; for that which makes manifest is Light, and
the reproof of Instruction is the way to Life; and as it is written in the
Scriptures of Truth, This is the condemnation of the world, that Light is come
into the world, and men love darkness rather than Light, because their deeds
are evil; but they that love the Light, and thereunto are turned, bring their
Works and Deeds to the Light, that with it they may be proved whether they be
wrought in God, yea or nay: But they that love their evil deeds more then the
Light, will not bring them to the Light, because it will reprove them. So now,
flee from the Mountains, and escape from the Hills, and none any longer seek to
hide your selves in the Clists of the raggy Rocks; for now the Lord is risen
from amongst all these Sects, and various Opinions, and diversities of
Judgments, and changeable forms of Worship that are not come (neither will be
persuaded) to forsake their evil deeds, and come to that which changes not,
but lives and abides for ever.

And now dear people this is the day of the lord, and none of you put it afar
off; verily the bowels of my Love flow forth unto you, and my heart is even
broken in the remembrance of you: Oh, how have you pierced the Jus;t One, and
grieved the good Spirit of God in you from day to day, and would have none of
his Counsel, neither hearken to his reproof, but have cast his righteous Law
behind your backs, and done despite to the Spirit of Grace! And now it would
be just from the Lord, that the day of your Visitation should pass over your
heads, which cannot again be recalled, but for the Seeds sake, and those in
whom there is any tenderness yet remains, and true breathings after the Lord,
which are not yet gathered unto the Lord, and to his Living Witness in them; in
this their day there is a little dramm more of time added unto it, that they
may be tried unto the full, whether they will return to the Lord that they may
be preserved out of the mouths of the Lions, and out of the paw of the Bear,
and escape the wrath of the Almighty, and the overflowing scourge that is
coming upon the heads of the wicked and ungodly, that hate the Lord, and
desires not the knowledge of his way; the which, neither hills nor mountains
can stop or hinder, but it will them overtake unavoidably.

Written by the movings of the Spirit of the Lord; and in Love unto all that
have desires after him, and are seeking of him where he is not to be found; By
one whose Natural birthright was, and Outward being is, in the Town of
Hardingstone in North-Hampton-shire; who am known to many people by the name
of,

Unto you Priests and Professors of the Towns above mentioned, in particular is
this chiefly written and given forth; and by the Author thereof you are desired
to communicate is one to another; but the service thereof reaches unto all
which in these things mentioned, are concerned, where ever this may come.
