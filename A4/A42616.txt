GENEVA and ROME: Or, The ZEAL of both boiling over: In an earnest Dispute for
Praeminence, carried on at a Private Conference between Jack a Presbyter and
Believe-All a Papist.
Now Printed for Public Satisfaction.

I.
JOhn Presbyter and the Sons of the Pope
Had a late dispute of the right of the Rope,
Who'd merit hanging without any Trope.
Which no body can deny.
II.
First Jack held forth and bid him remember
The horrible Plot on the fifth of November,
The very Month preceding December.
Which, etc.
III.
The Thirtieth of January, the other replied,
We heard often at Rome, which cannot be denied,
Had Jack been Loyal then Charles had not died.
Which, etc.
IV.
Then John cried, out Damned Jesuit thou lie,
I only appeared for the Lord Jesus Christ,
Which thou as a Merit-monger deny'st.
Which, etc.
V.
The Powder Treason, Oh horrible Plot!
Why prithee. Jack Presbyter, be not so hot,
For Charles was killed and Jemmy was not.
Which, etc.
VI.
Then Presbyter John his Zeal was inflamed,
And now I find it I Will make thee ashamed.
If so, prithee Jack, let the Covenant be named.
Which, etc.
VII.
Why the Covenant named?'it is found on Record
To be an old and new Testament word,
As I proved to Charles by Text and by Sword.
Which, etc.
VIII.
Thou prove it to Charles? impertinent Ass,
What thou design'dst old Noll brought to pass,
And then like a Beast he turned thee to grass.
Which, etc.
IX.
A Truce, a Truce, quoth Presbyter Jack,
We both love Treason as Loyalists Sack,
And if either prevails the King goes to rack.
Which, etc.
X.
The Bishops tell Charles we both have long nails,
And Charles shall find it if either prevails,
For like Sampsons Foxes we are tied by the Tails.
Which, etc.
XI.
The Jes;uits and the Brats of John Knox
Both visited Europe with the French Pox,
By the means of Loyola and Calvin the Fox.
Which no body can deny.
FINIS.
