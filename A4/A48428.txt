To the HONORABLE. Sir Cloudsley Shouel, Knt. Vice Admiral of the RED SQADRON
Of the Royal Navy of England.
Renowned SIR,
MY chief aim in Publishing this small Piece, is for the benefit of Seamen, who
is known to be the chief Bulwark of our Kingdoms, and upon whose undaunted
Courage, Resolution and Conduct, our Liberties and Properties wholly depend;
who vindicate our Rights with the expense of their dearest Blood. The
undeserved Disappointments they have received, unknown to your Honor, for some
Years past; and the many Losses they have sustained for want of good
Instructions, has induced me to the greatest part of this work, which I hope
will be of good use to them if duly applied.

I don't mean there is any unjust thing put upon them by their Superior
Officers, who has a paternal care over them, but that they have not consulted a
due Information for their own Interest.

This I can safely say, the informing of Seamen was my only aim in this small
Piece, when I first set my Resolutions upon it; but having a Manuscript by me,
writ by the famous Sir John Narbrough, I was advised by some Friends to put
some material and useful things therein mentioned, in this, which I have done
exactly from the Original.

When I resolved to make this Piece public, the Epistle Dedicatory was mainly
in the choice of a Patron, to testify my esteem of those extraordinary
Qualifications in you, that have gained the Affections of even the best and
worst of Seamen, for whose sakes I have dedicated it to you, who sit at the
Helm of their Government, to guide and direct them in their true Course, not
doubting but you will accept of the weak Labors of

SIR, Your Honors most humble Servant, James Lightbody.

THE MARINERS Jewel; OR, A Pocket Companion for the Ingenious. The Introduction.
EVery Artist knows, That the Art of Navigation consists chiefly in
Arithmetic; and because Decimal Fractions is so much wanting, and so little
used amongst Seamen, it will not be amiss to go through all the Rules thereof,
and then show the use of each Rule in its proper place; so that the ingenious
Artist may with a great deal of Facility go through that long and tedious Work,
often occasioned by Vulgar Fractions: Not but that I leave every Man to his own
fancy, to use that which he in his own Opinion thinks best.

It Is true, Vulgar Fractions is unavoidable in some Cases, but in that which is
chiefly designed here, Decimal Fractions may be used in every respect easier
and more correct than Vulgar.

CHAP. I. Of Decimal Arithmetic. Notation of Decimals.
A Decimal is that by which is distinguished the Parts of a Unite: And is
decreased from Unity to so many Tenth Parts of a Unite. For Unity is divided
into ten parts, and every tenth part is called a Prime, every hundredth part is
a Second, and every thousand part a third, etc. So as whole Numbers increase by
Tens from the Unites place toward the left hand, so Decimals decrease by Tens
from the Unites Place toward the right hand, as may appear by the following
Example.

1 1 2 3 4 5 6 Unity or an Integer. Primes, or tenth parts. Seconds, or hundr.
parts. Thirds, or thous. parts. Fourths, or 10 thous. pts. Fifths, or 100
thous. pts. Sixths, or 1000000 pts.

For 10 Primes is one Unite, and 10 Seconds is one Prime, and 10 Thirds is one
Second, and 10 Fourths is one Third, etc. So that every place toward the left,
is ten times less than the preceding Figure: For preponing of Ciphers, lessen
the following Figure in a tenfold manner; for (.2) is two Primes, or two Tenths
of an Integer or Unite, but (.02) is but two Seconds, or two hundredth parts of
an Unite. Ciphers after a Decimal neither augment nor diminish the value of the
Decimal.

A Decimal is always distinguished from a whole Number by a Prick or Period, as
in the Numbers following.

15.3 365.3.262.15 1625.32 273.2

The Numerators are only set down, the Denominators being known by the number
of places in the Numerator; for if the Numerator consist but of one place as.1,
it is 1/10, if of two, as.22 it is 22/100, if of three, as.235 it is 235/1000,
etc.

I shall insist no more upon Notation of Decimals, the foregoing being
sufficient, but shall proceed to Addition.

Addition of Decimals.
Addition is the adding of Sums together, and making one entire Sum of two or
more; you must take particular care in placing whole Number under whole Number,
and Decimal under Decimal, and Unites under Unites, and Tens under Tens.

Suppose 325.7 were to be added to 463.72, I place them one under another in
manner following.

To 463.72 Add 325.7 Sum 789.42

Observe always to prick off as many Decimals in the Total, as there is in any
of the Sums to be added together.

Example.

To 365.23 Add 23.20 2.03 Sum 390.46

An Example of Addition, as to Timber or Board Measure.
Note, That all entire Quantities, as Feet, Yards, Else, Ounces, Pounds, and
Hundred Weights, are divided into a hundred Parts, therefore the one fourth of
any one of these is.25, the half is.50, and the three fourths is.75.

There is three Boards of these following dimensions; what is the Sum of Feet
and Parts?

Feet. Parts. The first Board 246.25 The second 43.50 The third 16.26 The Sum
306.01

The Total Sum is 306 Foot, and one hundredth part of a Foot.

Addition of Money.
A pound Sterling is likewise divided into 100 parts. So.05 is the Decimal for
one shilling, and.10 for two shillings, and.15 for three shillings, etc.

Suppose I were to add 3 shillings and 4 pence to 2 shillings and 3 pence.

The Decimal for 3 shill. is.15 The Decimal for 2 shill. is.10 The Decimal for
4 pence is.0166667 The Decimal for 3 pence is.0125 Sum.2791667

It is very hard for the Learner to know the value of this Total, being he is
not come the length of Multiplication, which is the only Rule useful in this
case. The general Rule is, every Prime or Unite in the Total Sum is 2 shillings
value, and every 5 Seconds is one shilling, and the superplus of the Seconds
above 5 is so many ten farthings, and the number of Digits in the thirds place
is so many farthings: All the rest of the Decimals to the right being of no
value. The.2 Primes in the Total is 4 shillings, and the 5 Seconds of the seven
is one shilling, and the two remaining is 20 farthings; the 9 Thirds added
thereto makes 29 farthings, which is 7 pence farthing: but by reason the number
is above 25, the farthing must be cut off. The sum is 5 shill. and 7 pence.

So much for Addition of Decimals.
Subtraction of Decimals.
Subtraction is the taking a small sum from or out of a greater, as if you
would take 7 l. 5 s. 6 d.out of ten pounds 5 shillings and 6 pence, the
remainder must be 3 pounds; or if from 265.2, you would take 153.1, etc.

Example.

From 105.25 Foot of Superficial Measure subtract 97.25.

105.25 or from 1035.2 97.25 973.5 8.00 61.7

From.876 From 725.2 Take.324 Take 322.6 Remains.552 Remains 402.6

Multiplication of Decimals.
In Multiplication of Decimals, the method is the same as in whole Numbers;
only you are to prick off so many Decimals toward the right hand in the
Product, as there is Decimals in both Multiplicator and Multiplicand: As
suppose I were to multiply 26.75 by 35, there must be two Decimals pricked off
in the Product, by reason there is two in the Multiplicand.

Example 1.

Of Mixed Numbers.
Multiplicand 26.75 Multiplicator 35 13375 8025 Product 936.25

Example 2.

246.32 24.61 24632 147792 98528 49264 5061.9352

Example 3.

32.6.2 6.52

Example 4.

6.32753 32.64 2531012 3796518 1265506 1898259 206.5305792

Here you see in the fourth Example, there is in the Multiplicator and
Multiplicand 7 Decimals; therefore I prick off as many in the Product as there
is in both.

Note, That as whole Numbers multiplied by whole Numbers in^^^ase their value,
so Decimals multiply (...) by Decimals decrease their value, by reason the
Product is removed farther from Unity, than either of the Decimals given to be
multiplied, as shall appear by the following Example.

.03.75.32.2.04.4.006.0300.128

It will sometimes fall out, that there are not so many Figures in the Product
as there are Decimals in the Multiplicand and Multiplicator; in such cases you
must place Ciphers before the Figures, till they be equal: As you shall see in
the following Work.

Examples.

.004.42 6.5.22.002.07.0002.4 Prod.000008.0294.00130.088

Devision of Decimals.
We shall in the next place proceed to Division of Decimals, which is the most
difficult of all the rest; all the difficulty being to find the true value of
the Quotient.

The general Rule is, when you have finished your Division, to prick off so
many Figures to the right hand, as will make the Decimals in the Divisor equal
in number to those in the Dividend, and the Figures to the left are whole
Numbers.

Example 1.

Let 64.326 be divided by 32.4.

32.4) 64.326 (.19 3192 2766 174

You see in the foregoing work, that there is three Decimals in the Dividend,
and one in the Divisor; therefore I make that 1 in the Divisor, and 2 in the
Quotient equal to the 3 in the Dividend.

Example 2.

.325) 53.62321 (161.19 2012 623 2982 571 246

Example 3.

Let 28. be divided by 32.6

In this Example the Divisor 32.6 is greater than 28. the Dividend; in this and
all other such cases, you must place a competent number of Ciphers behind the
Dividend; and if it be a whole Number, you are to divide, you must prick off
the Ciphers from the whole Numbers and then proceed in your Division as you
were to divide whole Numbers.

32.6) 28.00000 (.8585 1920 2900 1920 290

Example 4.

To divide a Decimal Fraction by a Decimal Fraction.

Let.900 be divided by.05

.05).900 (18.0 40 00

Let.9000 be divided by.0005

.0005).9000 (1800 40 000

Would not one think it very strange a Decimal Fraction divided by a Decimal
Fraction, should bring forth a whole Number in the Quotient. But I shall make
it very plain, that it must be so and no otherways, by a reasonable
Demonstration.

By the first Example, you see I divide.900 by.05, and the Quotient I find to
be 18.0, that is, because there is three Decimals in the Dividend and one in
the Divisor, I make up the number of those in the Dividend, by taking one
Decimal from the Quotient, and adding to the 2 in the Divisor.

Now the nature of the Question is thus: I desire to know how many times 5
Seconds in 9 Primes? The Answer is 18. For there is 18 times 5 Seconds in 9
Primes.

If it fall out at any time, that there is not so many Figures in the Quotient,
as will make these in the Divisor equal in Number to those in the Dividend;
then you must prepone Ciphers before the Quotient to the left hand, as in the
following Example.

4).13779 (.03444

I shall give you an Example as to the Use and Application of Division of
Decimal Fractions, to the end that those who intend to use Decimals may the
better understand what they are going about.

Suppose I were to divide 10 shillings amongst 20 Men, the Decimal for 10
shillings is.50; therefore I divide my Decimal.50 by the number of Men 20, and
the Quotient will be.025, which is the Decimal equal to 6 pence; for if you
multiply.025 by 12, and double the Product, it will be 6 pence.

I could give several Examples of this kind, but the various Examples that will
happen in the following work, will in its proper place, give a clearer
Demonstration than can be here expected; so I shall refer the Learner to the
practice in General, and proceed to my intended work.

CHAP. II. To find the Burden, and how to Rigg a SHIP.
BEfore we proceed to the Rigging of a Ship, it is proper we should know her
Burden; they having a dependency upon each other. For you cannot know how to
Rigg a Ship without you know the length and breadth of her, no more than you
can know (...) Burden; but when she is once R^^^d (if according to Art or
Proportion) you may know her Burden without taking the length and breadth:
Therefore I say, we shall begin gradually first to know her Burden, and so go
on.

To find the Burden of any Ship.
Take the length of the Koel, and the breadth of the Beam, from Plank to Plank,
and multiply the one by the other, and the Product multiply by the depth of the
Hold; and the last Product divide by 100, and the Quotient is the Burden of a
Ship; or, to save the trouble of Division, cut off two Figures to the right
hand of the last Product, and the remaining Figures to the left hand is equal
to the Ships Burden.

Example.

The length of a Ships Keel is 68 Foot. The breadth of the Beam is 26 Foot. 408
136 1768 The depth is -- 12 3536 1768 The Ships Burden is 212.16 Tun

There is several Divisors, as 97. 98. 99. and some use 93. but I am sure that
100 is the most honest and exact Divisor.

The length of the Mainmast is twice and a half the breadth of the Beam.

Multiply the length of the Mainmast by 8, and divide by 9 for the length of
the Foremast or Boltspreat.

The true length of the Foremast is 8/9 of the Mainmast.

The Misson-mast is the length of the Foremast.

The length of the Main-Yard is the breadth of the Beam, and the length of the
Keel.

The Fore-Yard is 8/9 the length of the Main-Yard.

The Sprit-Sail-Yard is 8/9 the length of the Fore-Yard, the Craggick-Yard the
length of the Main-Yard.

To find the Lengths and Thickness of Masts and Yards by the Pen.
We shall begin with the Mainmast of a Ship, whose length of Keel is 73. Foot,
breadth of the Beam 28.5 Foot, the depth of the Hold 12. Foot.

The only Rule to find the length of the Mainmast, is to add the breadth of
the Beam and the depth of the Hold together, and divide the Product by 1.5, and
the Quotient is the Yards in length; the Mainmast of the Ship must be,

Example.

The breadth of the Beam 28.5 The depth of the Hold 12.0

1.5) 40.5 (27 105 000

The length of the Mainmast sought is 27 Yards or 81 Foot.

Those that are not very expert at Division, may make use of the following
Multiplicator, which will perform the fame as the Division does, and will be a
great deal easier for the Learner, if he do but observe to prick off the
Decimals to the Right hand, as is directed in the foregoing Work.

Example.

The Sum of the breadth and depth is 40.5, the which I multiply by the proper
Multiplicator.6666, and the Product is 26.99730 which is 26 yard, and 99
hundredth parts of a yard, which wants not one second to make it 28 yards,
equal to the former Work.

To find the thickness of the foregoing Mast or any other mast of the Ship, you
are to take the length of the Mast mentioned in the foregoing Table, and say by
the Rule of Proportion,

If 84 give 28 (as in the Table) what will 81 give.

84 28 81 28 224 2268 (27 Foot. 588 000

Here we find the thickness of the Mainmast of the propounded Ship to be 27
foot; now to find the thickness or length of the other Masts of the same Ship.

If for the Thickness of any of the Masts, you must it work by the foregoing
Rule, taking out the length of the Mast you require from the foregoing Table;
and as the length there requires so much, what will the length found require?

You must find your lengths of the several Masts and Yards by the Rule before
directed.

Suppose I was to find the length of the Foremast, having the length of the
Mainmast; I multiply the length of the Mainmast by 8, and divides the Product
by 9, and the Quotient is the length of the Foremast required.

As for Example, the length of my Mainmast is 81 Foot, the which I multiply by
8, and divides by 9, and the Quotient is 72, the length of the Foremast sought.

Now, if you would have the length of the Mizon-mast, being that it is the
length of the Foremast; you must multiply the length of the Foremast by 3,
and divide the Product by 4, and the Quotient is the length of the Mizon-mast;
the Fore-Yard is in proportion to the Main-yard, as the Foremast is in
proportion to the Mainmast.

Thus we have inserted most material things as to a Ships Rigging: but because
the way here inserted will be troublesome and tedious, unless to some Artists
who take pleasure therein, we shall set down a plain and easy way, by which any

A Guide to Pursers and Stewards Belonging to the NAVY, Wherein is set down The
King's Allowance of Victuals for every day in the Week, with directions how to
make up his Accounts, and what methods to use; so that he may discharge his
Duty to the King, as well as to the Seamen.
To cast up a Proportion of Sea Victuals for 40 Men 112 Days.
40 Men. 112 Days. 80 40 40) 4480 1/7) 4480 640 3) 1920 240 2 480 pounds of
bread and gallons of beer; which divide by 7, gives the number of 4 pound
pieces, of beef, and 2 ll. pieces of pork, and quarts of Peese, which
multiplied by 3, and divided by 8, gives 240 sized Fish (or Gallons of
Oat-meal) and pounds of butter, which multiplied by 2, gives pounds of Cheese.

Account of what Victuals one man is allowed for every day in one Week.
Sun. Mun. Tues Wed Thu. Fry. Sat. Tot Bisquet Pounds 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 7 Beer
Gallons 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 7 Beef Pounds 2 2 4 Pork Pounds 1 1 2 Pease Pints. 2 Fish
Sized. Butter Ounces. 2 2 2 6 Cheese ounces. 4 4 4 12

Note, That for Fish they give Oatmeal.

Multiply the Number of Men by the number of days you are to Victual, and that
gives the number of pounds of Bread or Biscuit. Then for Beer, divide by 60 the
number of Gallons in a Hogshead, and that divide by 4, gives the number of
Tuns: As for Example, 112 Days. 40 Men. 60) 4480 (74 Hogsh. and 40 Gallons,
which divide by 4, gives) 74 (18 Tuns, and 2 Hogsheads, and 40 Gallons.

Then for your 4480 pounds of Bread, divide by 7 Four Pound pieces of Beef, and
2 Pound pieces of Pork, and Quarts of Pease (1/7) 4480 (640

Then for your 640 Quarts of Pease, divide by makes Gallons, and your Gallons
divided by 8, makes Bushels.

Then for your 640 Quarts of Pease, multiply by 3, and divide by 8, and it
gives you the sized Fish, or in lieu thereof as many Gallons of Oat-meal.

Then for 240 Sized Fish, there is also as many Pounds of Butter.

Then for 240 pounds of Butter, twice so many pounds of Cheese.

Upon the passing your Account, you will be allowed a Tun of Cask per month for
Water, and 3 Biscuit Baggs for a 4th. Rate; for Iron Hoops small Allowance.

Have a care to deduct your part as well of Beer, Pease and Oatmeal by measure,
as of Butter, Cheese and Bread by weight, to make good your waste, for none
dare dispute it without detriment.

If you have any Provisions to spare, or your Eights in England, the Victualler
pays, viz.

For Bread 1 d. per pound. Beer 28 shill. per Tun. Beef 8 d. per Piece. Pork 5
d. per Piece. Pease 2 shill. 6 d. per Bush. Oatmeal 4 shill. per Bushel. Butter
3 d. d. per pound. Cheese 1 d. s. per pound.

But what they do to the Southward I don't know.

If your Men have any Provisions to spare that is due, besure not to refuse the
buying of it, at such Rates as Money is to be got by it; as Bread at 5 s. 6 d.
per Cent. 112 ll. to the 100; but have a care to reduce it to 16 Ounces to the
pound. Beef and Pork at 4 d. per piece, which will turn to account. If you
spend Oatmeal, besure not to buy your Men out of it, for that will be loss to
you; but if you are to pay first Money, you will receive 9 d. per Month, which
you may buy for 6 d. if you let them have Money beforehand.

After you have Victualled and Indented, you must set it down in your Book for
that purpose, and keep your Debtors part together, that you may give a due
charge to the Surveyor of Victualling, when you come to pass your Account.

Provisions you will receive sometimes, which must always be charged to your
Debtors part, as also Provisions borrowed from other Ships.

Victualling other Ships Men must be kept an account of, with their true names
and time of beginning and ending, and by what order Victuall'd; so that you may
discount it with the Purser of that Ship, either by Victuals back, or by
Receipts, or Money paid you for it.

At all times be careful, and stave no more Casks then necessity requires; for
the King pays 5 shill. per Tun for Cooperage, besides what you do your self;
for you will rarely find the number of Staves in any Cask, which you must
deliver to Tunnage, namely 28 But-Staves to a Butt, 26 to a Punchion, 24 to a
Hogshead, and 22 to a Barrel. And note, that two Pieces of single heading makes
a Stave, as well Cantle pieces as Middle pieces.

Men will urge you to scuttle Beef, Pork, Pease, Oatmeal, if you will be ruled by
them, but you are sure to pay for all your scuttled 4 d. per Butt, 3 d. per
Punchion, 3 d. per Hogshead, and 2 d. per Barrel Staves per piece, which avoid
as often as you can.

Keep your Cheque book going, and let not a Muster be made without your self or
Steward, to prevent your Victualling of Men in your own wrong, when pricked by
the Clerk of the Cheque; for do not fancy that these stand for a Cipher, for
they will out you of all your Provisions.

You are allowed 6 d. a Man per month necessary Money, with which you are to buy
Wood, Candles and Turnery-ware.

Your Lading Charges is 2 shill. per mensem. Your Adds Money -- 3 shill. 4 d.
per Month. You are Allowed 4 d. per Tun of drawage of the whole Provisions of
Beer, all which the Victualler will pay you when you Indent.

You are allowed 8 d. per Man a month Extra-necessary Money, which you are to
receive when you Indent.

If you indent for a proportion of Men under 60, then you are allowed 9 d. a
man a month, but no Adds-mony.

Your under Gauge is according to what your Cask holds, viz.

A Butt 108 Gallons. Punchion 72 Hogsh. 54 Barrel 36

According to the Gauge, and what is less than there is under Gauge, and what
is wanting of your Gauge, the Victualler will allow for it after the rate of 30
shill. per Tun, and sometimes 28 shill.

Take the Account of the under Gauge as follows, Admit I was to take in 40
Butts or more, set down the number gradually 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. and so to 40, and
set the mark on the Head against the Number, then add up all together, and
divide the Total by 216, and the Quotient is Tuns.

If you take in Cheshire Cheese for Suffolk, you must allow 3 ll. of Suffolk
for 2 pound of Cheshire.

If you take in Flower and Currents for Beef, and for Pork and Pease; you must
have 3 pounds of Flower and half a pound of Currents for a piece of Beef, and
piece of Pork and Pease.

All this you deliver by weight or measure; you must keep back the 8th. part
for Waste; you must take care that the weight be made after the rate of 14
Ounces to the pound, and that measure is 7 Pints to the Gallon.

If at any time you deliver to any other Ship, any proportion of Cask Bags or
Iron Hoops, take a Receipt for the same, specifying the particulars in words at
length, and deliver none without an order from your Commander, and take a
Receipt for the same.

If you go into any Harbor in the time of your Voyage, and enter into petty
Warrant, you are to specify in your Sea-Book the ending of Sea Victuals, and
the beginning of Petty Warrant; and the ending of the same, and beginning of
Sea Victuals.

In Petty Warrant you are allowed 12 d. a man per month necessary Money, but
not Adds Money, Lading Charges and Drawage.

When you receive any Warrants from the Clerk of the Cheque for Victualling, be
sure (before you give it the Victualler) take a Copy of them, that you may know
by casting up your Warrants, what they amount to.

You must be sure to return your Cask and Biscuit Baggs, for they will make you
pay 20 shill. per Tun for Cask, and 12 d. for each Bagg.

When you cast your Petty Warrant up, you are not to cast after the manner you
cast your Sea-Victuals; but you must take a particular Account how many Fish
Days and how many Flesh Days there are in that Warrant; so many pieces of Pork,
Quarts of Pease; Flesh-Days a piece of Pork, a piece of Beef, one 8th. part of
Sized Fish, 2 ounces of Butter, and a quarter of a pound of Cheese, Bread, and
Beer as above.

In Petty Warrant, you have 2 pound Loaves, and each man to have the half of it
a day; when you make up your Petty Warrant account, make your self Debtor and
Creditor, as follows, that is, Debtor on the left hand to all Provisions
received, with Cask, Iron-Hoops and Bags, and on the right Hand Creditor, by
what your Petty Warrant amounts to, and by Cask, Iron-hoops, and Biscuit Baggs
returned.
