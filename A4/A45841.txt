In Memory of his Highness GEORGE Duke of ALBEMARLE.
GReat Soul, whoever writes Thy Loss, should be
As great in Thoughts, if not in Deeds as Thee,
To tell Mankind thy true deserts of Praise
In purer Numbers then the common phrase.
For how can strained Imagination find
Words of apt Sense to fit so great a Mind?
And Verses in low-seated Fancies bred,
Like Streams, do ne'ro'rtop the Fountains head.
The common ways of Praise (ability
Of heart and body) is too coarse for Thee,
Since every common Hector of the Rout
Acquires the Epithets of Strong and Stout;
Endowments which our Maker did intend
As Instruments to serve another End
Then vulgar Praise, To give rough natures Law,
And teach assuming minds so stand in awe,
And stoop to what Heavens Majesty has sent
For humane preservation ( Government.)
This was Thy Work (great Duke) to save a State
In Civil Broyls, pressed down wit^ Rebels weight.
Its Body by ill humors grown ^o sick,
It had forgot the name of Politic;
Destitute both of Rule and Ruler too,
Divided into Sects, of one mind few:
And to help on its Ruin nearer hand,
Each of those Sects sought the Supreme Command.
Whatever ill Confusion might bring,
Or horrid War, came sailing with spread wing:
But being by Thy Watchful Soul descried,
Received its mortal wound (in the train) and died.
Thy mighty Merit now the World may know,
If they Peace as a Benefit allow.
The Roman Senate have decreed to men
Crowns, for redeeming of one Citizen.
Preservers of their Country Gods became,
And got their Adoration by their same:
But thy Deserts (besides thy Princes love)
We doubt not but have their Rewards above;
And have prepared a Diadem for Thee,
Who weighed three Kingdoms sunk in Misery.
