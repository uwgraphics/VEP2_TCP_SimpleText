The History of the GOLDEN-EAGLE.
CHAP. I.
How Albertus King of Arigon falling into a languishing disease, was advised by
his Physicians to provide for death, the news being spread over the Country,
many Magitians came to him, who told him, that if he could recover the golden
Eagle from the Queen of Ivy-land, he should questionless recover his health.

ALbertus having of late buried the soul of his life Lycimmena, his most
indulgent Queen, fell into extreme melancholy, which as it is commonly the
Parent of all diseases, so it brought him into a most tedious and languishing
sickness, which caused him to make moan both day and night, witness the bitter
groans, and passionate expressions for the ldss of his departed Consort: at
last, being importuned by several of his Nobles, and hourly entreated by his
three Sons, Ph^onzo, Cruentius, and Innocentine, he consented to send for the
chiefest Doctors in those parts to consult about the state and welfare of his
body; which Doctors being arrived, were presently conducted to the Kings
Chamber, at whose (...) the King broke out into these sad expressions:

YE are come to look upon a declining King, ye may endeavor to use your
skils, but I am confident your labors will be lost. Alas, my disease is too
inward to be found out, and if ye cure me, it must be more by miracle then
skill: If ye can cure an almost broken heart, or repair my half decayed
lungs, or restore my near wasted breath, then draw near, but Alas my Lysimena
and there his sighs denying him liberty of speech, he made signs to be no more
troubled, and turning from the company, and almost from his own senses, he
groaned himself into a deep melancholy.

The Doctors as yet being not thoroughly acquainted with his disease, verily
supposed him departing, but it probed otherwise; for his Sons and the rest of
the Nobility informing the Doctors of his grief, desired them to use their
best endeavors for his recoverie, which accordingly they did, but finding
little hopes of life, in respect that the distemper of his mind had so much
impaired the temper of his body, they only prescribed him cordials, which
indeed something revived and exhilarated his spirits, but could not give the
least hopes of life, in respect that nature was much extenuated and weakened by
his extraordinary melancholy.

The King whether less insensible of his disease, or somewhat more enlivened by
the prescriptions of the Doctors, destres two of the ablest of them to be
brought unto him, of whom he demanded their free and absolute opinions; The
Doctors after a short pause, who having more respect to conscience then gain,
told him that they might prolong, but not cure, and being about to proceed into
further discourse, there suddenly came in some of (...) Nobility and whispered
with one of the Doctors, which the King perceiving, demanded the cause, to
which his Nobility replied, that there were newly arrived several Magicians,
who hearing of his Majesty's distemper, came out of affectionate duty to employ
their skils for his recoverie; the King hearing this, dismissed the Doctors, and
admitted the Magitians, who being entered, and after the performance of their
several duties, applied themselves in this manner:

Most Renowned Sir, We the most humblest of all your servants, being by report
informed of your Majesty's heavy and grievous disease, have by our industry
found out a means which (though it may seem impossible to your Majesty) will
without question restore you to your former health, which means (craving the
favor of your Majesty's parience) we shall forthwith ^^^cover.

Know then most excellent Prince, that under the jurisdiction of Agrippina,
that most famous and invincible Queen of Ivy-land, there is a golden Eagle, in
whom there is a secret and infallible remedy for your disease; therefore if any
of those heroicke spirits which are belonging to your Majesty, that will
endeavor to procure this Eagle, your Majesty's life will questionless be
preserved, we shall not therefore trouble your Majesty's ears; with any
further relation, but leave your Majesty to the prosecution of what we have
relateds, only we will be bold to desire your Majesty not to be doubtful, for
be than your Majesty shall least respect or expect, shall perform this
dangerous and almost impossible design, so we leave your Majesty to your most
serious considerations.

CHAP. II.
The Magitians being gone, the King sends for his three Sons, and acquaints
them with what the Magitians had told him, proffering to divide his estate
between them if them could recover the Eagle from the Queen of Ivy-land,
wishing them to take what treasure they would for their occasions.

THe Magitians being departed, the King immediately gave command that his three
Sons should come unto him, and they as diligent to obey, as he was willing to
command, forthwith presented themselves before him; The King after some
discourse, told them that now his days were near finished, and nature began so
much to decline in him, that he was past the skill of Doctors; therefore let me
advise you as a dying Father, that as ye were born brothers in Nature, so to
continue in affection. Sir replied the eldest, if it please the Gods to dispose
of you to death (...) labor for that portion of content which may be
proportionable to our sorrows; for the decrees of Fate are not to be resisted,
and our reason tells us, that what we cannot remedy we must patiently endure,
but for my part (I dear say as much for my brothers) I would willingly hazard
my life for the prolongation of yours. Sir, I hope that you will please to
apprehend that the possessions which are like to fall to us after your death,
do not any way incite us either to hope, or wish for your death; with that, the
two other Brothers not able to contain any longer, desired their Father to
employ them in any thing whereby they might exprese their obedience to him, to
which the King (joyful to see their passionate obedience) replied, that there
was but one way to save his life, which was to do according to the directions
of the Magitians, who informed him, that if he could by any means recover the
Golden-Eagle from the Queen of Ivyland, that then he should be restored to his
former health; but says he, I find it a thing impossible, therefore I shall
not trouble my self with the thoughts of obtaining it, for the Queen is of that
power and strength, that if I should persuade any to attempt it, I should be
guilty of their deaths, and so depart this world with a burdened conscience,
but my Sons, I am very well content to leave those slaveries which are
attendants to a Crown, I can only pray for you, and that is my uttermost.

Before the King had made an end of his intended discourse, (...) Sons
interrupted him with fighes, that floated in tears, and as well as their
sorrows would permit, they in most humble manner des^re^ the King to grant them
a bonne before his departure, to which the King pleasingly replied, enjoy your
desires, provided ye ask what is necessary for me to give, speak, what is your
boon? to which they replied:

Renowned Sir, It was not long since you were pleased to bless our ears with
the discourse of the Magitians, who have assured both you and us, that if the
Golden Eagle can be recovered, your health shall be renewed; Then know Sir,
that as our bodies are derivatives from you, so they are by all Laws whatsoever
to be at your disposing, and here we present our selbes before you, and protest
with all our souls to hazard, nay lose our lives, but we will obtain the
Eagle; for you know Sir, that resolution backed with obedient affection, knows
no imposs ivilities; Sir we shall not arise from our knees till you have
granted our request, and at your Royal consent we will forthwith fly into
action.

The King seeing them so resolved, thought it superfluous to endeavor to
discourse them out of their resolutions, but told them, that since their
obedience made them so ready to undertake so great a hazard, his affections
should promp him, at their return, to divide all his treasure (which at that
time was very great) amongst them; in the mean time he advised them to provide
themselves with what money they would, and all other accoutrements necessary
for their adventure, which they accordingly did.

CHAP. III.
How the Kings three Sons provided for their journey, and took leave of their
Father, and departed, and what happened between them in their journey.

THe three Brothers having prepared themselves for their journey, came in
humble manner to take leave of (...) King, who they found, as formerly very
much troubled with melancholy, but the eldest addressing himself unto him,
began in this manner:

Royal Sir,
WE your most obedient sons, in order to our dear affections, more then your
Royal command, present our selves to crave your blessing upon us, and our
destgnes, before our departure, not despairing of our desires we humbly crave
--

The King looking upon them with a countenance that imported unexpressable
grief for their departure, raised himself from his pillow, and with a stretched
out arm gave them his blessing, withal advising them as they were Brothers in
nature, so to continue Brothers in affaction, and to have a care that naither
Eaby nor Ambition, or ambitious Enby should raise a factious difference amongst
them, but as departed Brothers, and so consequently friends, so they should
adventure and return in the like amity they departed, and so the greatest
blessing a dying Father can bestew upon his departing children accompany you;
but before you go, let me as a Father advise you of two things, the one is the
displeasure of the Gods by the neglect of your duty to them, the others is, the
danger of evil company which may seduce you to many inconveniences, and so
farwell; what I want in words I shall supply in thoughts.

Thus these three Brothers having received the sum of their destres, departed
from the presence of their Father, and so taking leave of their friends at
Court, departed: At last, having journeyed three days, they came by the
mistake of their way into a great wood, where being in a wilderness of doubt,
they consulted what was best to do; Philonz^ the elder Brother, beginning
already to find the encumbrances of travel, expressed himself to the others, as
follows:

WE see dear Brothers, the many troubles the want of consideration brings upon
us, we have (as I have (...) it in my more serious thoughts) undertaken a most
dangerous, troublesome, and almost inpossible design; to prevent this, (...)
shall we advise? If we should return home, we should turn our noble
undertakings to ignominy and shame, and it we proceed, without question we
shall lose our lives, and what will the world say but this, they have the
effect of their rasbuess; for the more dangerous a design is, the more it
ought to be discust, but that like Phaeton, mount at imposs vilities, shall at
last fall like Phaeton, with shame and dishonor; therefore Brothers let me
hear your advice, to which Cruentius the second Brother replied:

It Is true, rash beginnings have most commonly fatal conclusions: For my part,
as yet I never weighed the business, nor the danger, but altogether depended
upon your judgment as an Oracle, not dreaming but you had known she difficulty
of the bustness: But stay now, I better consider the matter, methinks it should
not be so difficult, for sure we three can conquer one Eagle; for Brother you
shall catch her, and I will warant you my Brother and I will hold her, but
where shall we find her? fle Brother, quoth Philonzo, I sie you as much err in
the matter as I did in the manner of the bustness. This Eagle is a bird kept
for her Soveraigntie in a great City walled round with brass, pallazado'd with
iron, guarded with Lions and Dragons, and commanded by Giants, and we must
before we come to this City Encounter with several Knights which attend
purposely for such attempters as we must be: Many have attempted, but never any
as yet returned to tell the manner of their attempts; therefore Brother the
business is of more intricacy then you imagine. O monstrous cried Cruentius, I
am more then half dead already with the relation, talk no more of it. What,
Dragons, and Bears, Lions, and Giants, Brazen walls, and iron Pallizadoes? Oh
how I am thundered to death, attempt it who will, for my part I will starve here
rather then be earen with Bears and Lions, and Dragons, and -- oh borrible
Giants, not I, Brother Innocentine what say thou to these terrible things?
what, art not afraid? well, I have fear enough for you both, but good Brother
speak, to which Innocentine the younger undauntedly replied:

AS I am youngest in years, so I am last in speech, and I could wish I might be
the least; but in respect I am to make answer to both your demands, I must a
little exercise your patience. It Is true, the danger is great, therefore the
more noble, but had you my Brrethren, according to my Fathers advice,
importuned the gods before you had undertaken this great design, questionless
the one had not been so filled with doubts, nor the other with fears, nor I
with shame for you both; you seem to be as much displeased at my words as I am
at your actions; shall we begin to tire before we begin to do? for shame let
not the world have this advantage of our reputations; if we return home, we
must expect to undergo a disgrace worse then death; if we dye, we dye in high
attempts, who knows but that the gods may show extraordinary favors, and smile
at our designs, being we do it for our dear Fathers life: If the worst come
to the worst, we can but dye, and we had better do so then live as if we lived
not, but I perceive my discourse offends, I will be therefore silent.

CHAP. IV.
How Philonzo and Cruentius hearing the discourse of their younger Brother
Innocentine, robbed him of his treasure, and left him bound in a Wood, where
they afterward lost themselves.

CRuentius hearing his Brothers discourse, which was contrary to his
expectations, told him that he was a very rash boy, and understood not what he
spoke; for says he, shall we cast away our lives because the world should say
we died nobly: Brother, says he to Philonzo, are we bound to be fools because
he is mad, no, let us leave him to his thoughts of honor, whilst you and I
consult what is best to do; so walking a distance from him, they sat down, and
began thus to express themselves:

Brother Philonzo, I have in this short time both considered the shame and the
danger, let us endeavor to haste to Mesemptronia, a City which I am sure
cannot be far from this place, where we may refresh our selves, and have
further discourse; but what shall we do, replied Cruentius, with you foolish
boy, you perceive how refractory and inconsiderate he is, and makes sight of
that danger which we know to be very great: If we leave him, questionless he
will return home and incense the King against us, what we shall do in this I
know not, but leave it to your discretion, let us force him with us, quoth
Philonzo, and make him do according to our wills, if not, we will threaten to
kill him; no quoth Cruentius, that cannot be, for then he will pry into all
our actions, and make a discovery at out returns; but Brother, quoth he, our
bussiness requires haste, let us therefore take away his treasure, and bind
him, and so leave him in the Wood, for it is better one perish then two, and if
the worst come to the worst, that he should be unloosed and return home: We
know at our return how to persuade that what he has related is only lies to
disgrace us, and by that means to insinuate the more into favor himself, and
injure us. I like this advice well, quoth Philonzo, let us quickly put in
execution, for the night hastens; with that returning to Innocentine, they
asked him what he intended to do, who replied, what they did not, and so you
shall quoth Cruentius, and so both running together laid hold on him, and
without hearing him speak, bound him, and took away his treasure, turning his
horse loose to range in the Woods, they departed. Thus lay poor Innocentine
miserably bound, insomuch that the swelling of hie hands and feet made him most
sadly lament his grievous tortures; but Philonzo and Cruentius having rambled
up and down the Wood for the space of two hours, could by no means find the
way out, insomuch that they despaired of traveling any further way out that
night but having not rode a flight-shot further, it happened that a dog having
lost his Master, came fawning on Cruentius, who presently laid hold of him, and
tying him in a string, followed the dog, who forthwith brought them out of the
Wood, and presently after to a Sheepherds house, where the dog found speedy
entertainment, but Philonzo and Cruentius none, where we shall for a time leave
them, and return to Innocentine, who they left bound in the Wood.

CHAP. V.
How Innocentine was unbound by an Hermit, and how afterward he saved a
beautiful Lady from ravishment, and how the Lady requited him.

INnocentine being fast bound by his unnatural Brothers, lay till the approach
of the evening in a most lamentable condidition, till at last a Hermit coming
from his Cell, to take the benefit of the cool of the evening, heard the sad
groans of poor Innocentine, and being moved with pity, he addressed himself
to the place (I may well say) of groans, where being come, his eye saw what his
heart pitied, his heart pitied what his hand relieved, for he forthwith
conducted him to his Cell, and made such preparations for him as his necessity
required, so that the next morning he was in a condition to travel; but the
Hermit viewing his guest, read in his countenance the characters of a noble and
ingenuous disposition, observing by his deportment, that he was not a man of an
ordinary education, besides being led by his own inclinations, he accosts his
stranger in this manner:

Sir,
I P^^^eive that your youth and education prompts you to bashfulness, and your
bashfulness hinders the liberty of your speech, I therefore h^^^tily entreat
you to inform me of your present condition, and what I want in power, I will
supply in prayer for you, I will not stand to trouble you to relate the
misfortunes, it is enough, and too much that I saw them, only tell me which way
you intend to steer, and what you want.

Innocentine all this while amazed at the courteste of the Hermit, knew not
presently what to answer, but as well as his late distemper attended with a
multitude of thoughts would permit, he thus replied:

Most charitable Father, I could grieve that I was forry for my last
misfortune, in respect that the happiness of your acquaintance is derived from
it, I will not trouble your patience with the discourse of my misfortune, only
in short, I am going upon a design to save the life of a renowned King, but
this misfortune has put me out of a capacity to follow my intentions; come
says the Hermit I know your disease, I Will be your Physician, take this cordlal
(giving him a bag of Gold and Jewels) and return no complemental answer, for I
am bound to do it, and if you want a Steeed, I have one for you which this
very day stragled hither, pray take him and use him as your own; but for this
sword, which I intend for your use, pray return it if you live, if not
conceal the virtue, for it will preserve you against all enchantments, which
are now very common to my woeful experience; neither need you fear who you
encounter with it, for you shall not want success. Innocentine, not a little
rejoiced at what the Hermit had told him, desired liberty to depart, in order
to which the Hermit conducted him to his horse, but it fell out that the horse
was his own, which he thought his Brothers had carried away with them; the
Hermit observing him look so strictly upon the horse, told him that he could
not promise him the like service from the horse as he did from the sword; no
Sir, quoth Innocentine. I believe I am better acquainted with the horse than
you, for yesterday he was mine, till taken from me by misfortune; but however I
cannot but express my hearty thanks (...) you, and (...) my return you shall
know more of me, in the mean time, let peace abide with you, let me only beg
your ^^^ections toward Green Iveland, for I am altogether a stranger in these
parts; your ready way, quoth the Hermit, is to go to Mesemptronis, a City
about three leagues from hence, the way is very direct through several
Villages, where you may at your pleasure enquire, but there is a Forest which
lies between a little Town called Corumbus and Mesemptronia, where you must
have a careful eye, lest you be set upon before you can provide for resistance,
this is all that I can advise you, and so farewell.

Thus they departed, and after the expense of some hours, Innocentine came to
the Forest which the Hermit told him of, where he was no sooner entered, but he
was welcomed with many loud and lamentable schreekes, which struck him into
admiration; but being of an undaunted spirit, and remembering the sad estate he
himself was in the day before resolved to find out the place where he heard
this lamentable noise; and being more directed by the ear then the eye, he at
length effected his desires, for immediately in a valley he espied two
villains about to ravish a Lady of an incomparable beauty, and being
passionately exasperated, he flew upon them like lightning, but giving them
leave to mount themselves, they instead of fight, presently run away,
perceiving it was their Brother: Innocentine perceiving their flight, clapped
spurs and followed them, but the Lady perceiving it, was fearful that two to
one might be very disadvantagious, cried out with what strength she had, help,
help, which Innocentine hearing, fearing some other accident had befallen the
Lady, speedily returned, but when he came he found no such matter, but the Lady
being heartily glad of his return, applied her self to him in this manner:

Most noble and renowned Knight, my late fright has so disordered my thoughts,
that for the present I cannot return you those thanks which are due to your
merits; but if you please to add one favor more to the rest, which is to
conduct me to my (...) habitation (from which place those villains you saw,
having surprised me in a solitary walk, dragged me) you will very much
increase my happiness; to which request Innocentine condescended, and in a
short time came to the place where he found a welcome entertainment: so after
many Ceremonies past between them, the Lady requested to know what his name and
birth was, to which Innocentine replied; so so much confidence have I of your
worth, that I will not keep the least of my thoughts from you; so composting
himself, he told her his name, birth and (...), and likewise told her how his
Brothers had dealt with him, which he was confident was those which would have
ravished her, had not he by providence preserved; the Lady hearing his
relation, was much astonished, but at last recalling her self from her
admiration, proceeded as follows:

Most magnanimous and ingenious Knight, I cannot but acknowledge my life and
honor to be protected by your virtue, I shall therefore in part of a requital
communicate something to you for your advantage, which in short is this:

Not far from this place there is an enchanted Castle kept by two Ladies, at
which Castle (if you please to go) you shall find civil entertainment from the
Ladies, one of them will much press you to marriage, but by no means consent,
but promise at your return to give satisfaction to her request, tell them
likewise that you have a short journey to take, but the horse dying in the
journey you are now quite destitute, then they will presently carry you into a
spacious Stable, where they will show you many Steeds, and bid you take your
choice, but refuse them all, but one, which seems to be the meanest there, and
they will be very unwilling to lend you him; You shall know him by this sign,
as soon as you come into the Stable you shall find him laid, and all the rest
standing. I will not now any longer detain you, leave your horse with me till
your return, and you shall accomplish your bustness, thus Innocentine and the
Lady parted, but we will now leave him, and return to the other Brothers,
which are by this time come to Mesemptronia.

CHAP. VI.
How Philonzo and Cruentius came to the Shepherds house, but could not be
entertained, and how they lay under an Oak that night, and the next morning
took their journey for Mesemptrome.

Philonzo and Cruentius being come to the Shepherds house, immediately
alighted and knocked at the door, but the old Shepherd and his wife being newly
gone to bed, were very unwilling to rise, at last the Shepherd hearing them
grow more violent in their knockes, arose, and looked out of (I cannot say the
window) but out of a hole, or crannie, and asked who was there; to which
Philonzo replied, a couple of Passengers which had lost their way in a Wood,
and by a dog which they followed, were brought thither. The Shepherds wife
which but a little before was awaked out of her sleep with sighing for the loss
of her dog, starts out of her bed and cries, oh her dear Cut, and so runs down
and lets in her dog, and after many expressions of insufferable joy, having
entertained her dog with many a sweet kiss, she went to bed and slept very
heartily, whilst Philonzo and Cruentius begged very earnestly for entertainment
to protect them from a storm which they (...) was hastening upon them, but all
their entreaties were in vain; for this Shepherd told them, that he and his
(...) were abused not long since by a couple that desired to be entertained, as
they did, and therefore he would not admit them by any means: At last, when
they saw their entreaties were in vain, they departed, trusting themselves to
the protection of an Oak, where they had not long reposed, but a great tempest
of thunder and lightning desiurbed them of their rest, so that they forsook
the place, as deeming it dangerous to lie there in such tempestuous weather; so
wandering up and down all night, without any rest, in the morning they prepared
for their journey, and being at last refreshed with the heat of the Sun,
they spurred heerfully along till they came within view of a (not stately) but
well situated house, not far from which they espied a beautiful Lady walking
so solitary, that she hardly took notice of her own thoughts: Philonzo riding
toward her, and surprising her on a sudden, put her into such an amasement,
that for the present she neither knew what to do, or say; but Philonzo well
skilled in the rudiments of malicious impudence, begins to accost her in this
manner:

Madam, quoth he, I very much commend your choice, you have chosen a pleasant
morning, and a sweet air for your private meditations; Sir, replied the Lady,
the walk and air would be more pleasant if you were further from it, I wonder
a Knight, as you seem to be should be so unadvised, or rather uncivil, to
intrude without notice, or acquaintance; Sir, if you are noble, show it by your
forbearance, to which replied Philonzo:

Madam, had you been less beautiful, I had been less ambitious, but Madam your
beauty is the Author of my bold intruston; but I hope you have goodness to
pardon, as well as I have infirmities to offend; Sir, quoth the Lady, the
vanity of Courtship has taught me to dislike a Courtier, I will therefore
leave my walk to your enjoyment. Nay, quoth Philonzo, I cannot so suddenly
dismiss you, for your beauty has made a conquest of my heart, so either return
what your be^^tie has robbed me of, or I must be enforced (...) it. Sir, quoth
the Lady, I neither know your intent, nor meaning, but I expect you to be
civil, therefore pray wr^ng not my expectations: At which words Philonzo
beckning to his Brother Cruentine, that stood within sight, presently with much
rigor and incivilitie laid hold on her, and dragged her into a Forest which
was within half a mile, being assisted by his Brother Cruentine; I need not
tell the Reader, of the many tears, the grievous complaints, the sundry
prayers this poor distresed Lady made to these unhumane Villains, but all to
no purpose: For had not an unexpected Knight passed by, who hearing the skreeks
of one in distress, boldly approached to the place, where he found these
Villains endeavoring to rob her of her chastity who they spying perceived
him to be their Brother which they left bound in the Wood, ran away, and at
last arrived at Mesemptronia, where being come, they presently went to their
Inn, and so to rest, not the least troubled at their Barbarous cruelty; the
next morning approaching, they arose, and commanded a plentiful dinner to be
provided, and that such company as the City afforded should be invited to keep
them company, being strangers, at that time, to which their host preferring
his own gain, condescended, and forthwith sent for a crew of the most
notoriousest cheats the Town could afford, who very plausibly treated the new
come guests, telling them of many Courtisans that the City abounded withal,
which were presently sent for, and a great banquet provided, to the admiration
of the diligently joyful host; but after some days of their abode, they began
to feel a consumption in their pockets, which caused them to consult of their
departure.

CHAP. VII.
How Innocentine his desire in the enchanted Castle, with a prom^^^ to return;
how he recovered the Golden Eagle from the Queen of Green Ivy-land, whose horse
was turned into a man who afterward directed him what to do.

AFter Innocentine perceived which Steed it was which the Lady advised him to
request, he was very importunate with the Ladies to let him have that horse
which was laid, to which they replied, alas, that was the worst in the stable,
desiring him to make some other choice; but he replied, that the other were too
good and too lusty for him, in respect that he was a very bad horseman. The
Ladies seeing that he would not be denied, endeavored to inchaunt him, but
their enchantments would not take effect, because the Hermit^ sword was his
preservative. Thus seeing all their labor in vain, they made him swear that he
would return again, and he should have his destres; but to be short, having
swore according to their desires, the horse was brought forth, he leaping upon
him, was on a sudden carried to Green Ivy-land, and in his journey overthrew
many Knights which waited there on purpose to encounter any that should
approach; but he with his good sword and Steed made slight of them, then he
approached to the brazen walls where he was welcomed with the roaring of Lions
and Dragons, but as he brandished his sword they fell into a dead sleep, then
Innocentine passed freely, not long after he came to a Fort that was guarded by
Giants, who when they perceived his approach, presently came running at him
with great violence, but he no sooner brandished his sword but they fell all a
sleep; at length, having many more difficulties, which are now too tedious to
relate, he came to the place where the Queen and the Eagle was; The Queen and
her attendance beholding a stranger so near her presence, began to rebuke his
insolency, but he brandishing his sword, the Queen and all her attendants sell
asleep, insomuch that they could not be waked, in the mean time Innocentine
alighted and took the Eagle, with no small joy, and was departing, but his
horse would not by any means stir a foot from the place, which made
Innocent^^^ in a doubt what to do; but beholding the incomparable beauty of
the Queen, he drew near and (...) her as she slept, after which Innocentine cnt
off a lock of the Queens hair and left a lock of his in her bosom, and then
he took a ring of rich value from her finger, and put one of his in the same
place; then finding her picture about her neck, he took that off and supplied
the place with his own. Having done these things, he writes these lines, and
pinnes them upon the sleve of her garment: Renowned Queen, what here is done,
Was acted by a Monarchs son:
But before I could depart,
I took your Eagle, lest my heart,
Accept the change, and pardon the abuse,
Virtue whilst you remain will be in use.


Having thus done, he mounts his horse with the Eagle in his hand, and was
immediately brought to the Forest where be preserved the Lady from ravishment:
his steed making astand at a great River, would not go any further,
notwithstanding Innocentine used all the skill he could with switch and spur,
but at last his horse spoke, and bid him forbear and a light; Innocentine not a
little amazed, alighted, then the horse began to tell him that he must chop off
his head, and throw it into that River, withal bidding him not to be afraid,
for he intended him no harm, but says he, when you have thrown me in, stand
with your sword by the River, and in what shape soever you see me appear knock
me down again, till I arise in the shape of a man; Innocentine being something
amazed at this sudden and strange alteration, knew not for the present what to
do, but after a little pause he resolved to do it, which being done, he threw
the head into the River, and it rose up the first time like a Lion, but he
presently knocked it down, then it rose up in several other shapes but he still
kept it down but at last it arose like a tall proper man, and then he help it
out which being done, the man bid him fear nothing but follow his advise, and
give ear to him whilst he informed him of something which might conduce to his
benefit: I was, says he, a Knight inchannted in that Castle that you had me
out of, and all those fair Steeds you saw were inchaunted Knights, I am
likewise the husband of that Lady you preserved from the violence of your
Brothers; which Brothers will meet with you before yuu come home, with full
resolution to kill you, but fear not, hide the King and Picture which you had
of the Queen, and desire them not to kill you, but tell them you will never
discover them to your Father, then they shall take away your Eagle and let you
go; thus as you have preserved me and mine, I will preserve you and yours.

CHAP. VIII.
How Philonzo and Cruentius obtained a counterfeit Eagle in the City of the
Mesemptronia, and returning home met their youger Brother Innocentine, and
robbed him of his Eagle, and what after happened.

PHilonzo and Cruentius having spent most of their money, at last agreed with
some in the City to get him an Eagle, which they pretented thy could do, which
was not long effecting, for they got a very great Foul, the nearest they could
like a Eagle, and gilded his feathers, and brought it to them, which they with
much joy accepted, giving a large sum for it, and forthwith departed the
City; but as they traveled, it was their fortune to meet their Brother
Innocentine carrying an Eagle in a filver cage, at the sight whereof their
Eagle trembled and dyed, but without the least salute to their Brother they run
upon him and would have killed him, but he according to his advise had hid the
King and ^^^cture in a private place about him, which they discovered not, but
took away Cage and Eagle, with full ^^^ent to kill him; but he with many
passionate expressions diverted their intentions, promising them to become
their Servant, and never betray them to his Father; they hearing these
promises, saved his life, and so he became their Servant, and they journeyed
together, at last coming home and carrying their Eagle in tritriumph, they
were joyfully entertained, the King embracing the two eldest, and commanding
the youngest to be immediately put to death for those lies which his Brothers
had related of him; but Innocentine heartily begged of his Father that he
might not be put to death, and so did his Brothers seemingly, but that he might
be made inseriour to the worst servant in the house, to which the King, though
unwilling, agreed; this was poor Innocentine, that deserved a just reward,
cast out of his Fathers favor for ever; but it happened that not long after
the Queen of Green Ivyland, hearing where her Eagle was, came with a great
Train to Arigon, and presented her self to the King, who was absolutely cured
by the virtue of the Eagle, the Queen receiving that vountiful entertainment
which her estate required, asked the King how many sons be had, to which the
King replied, two, she desired she might be allowed so great a savor as to see
them, immediately they appeared; so she called Philonzo, and asked him if he
was the man that made so gallant an attempt for her Eagle, he replied, it was
his poor endeavor that obtained it, pray, says she, let me see some
assurance, did you leave me nothing, nor take nothing from me, no replied
Philonzo, then quoth the Queen you are not the man; after him was presented
Cruentius, who the Queen in the like manner greeted, but he replied as Philonzo
did, that he took nothing from her, nor left any thing with her. The Queen
concealing her anger, told the King that these mysteries past her imaginations,
destred the King ingenioustie to tell her if he had no more sons, Kenowned
Queen I must confess I had another son, which now I own not, I think he may
be living amongst the mean servants of my house, but for a son, I own him
not, to which the Queen replied, she must needs see him; alas replied the King;
I think him not worthy of my presence, much more of so renowned a Queen as
your self: but to satisste your requests, he shall be called, in the mean time
the King departed, whilst Innocentine approached the Queens presence, to whom
the Queen discourst as follows:

Are you the youngest Son of this Koyal King, or no? he replied with a blushing
countenance, no; what, are you his servant? he replied no: Friend, you speak
very misteriously, discover they self; then know incomparable Lady, that my
Father being incensed against me condemned me to dye, but by the request of my
Brothers I was preserved, and became a servant to the worst of my Fathers
servants, contenting my self with these poor babilliments, which indeed were
they as rich as could be imagined, were too mean to be presented before so
worthy a person, as Madam, you are, and for my self. I could tremble into ashes
at the sight of so excellent a creature as your virtuous self, but I shall
remove so unworthy an object from your fight, and crave license to depart; no
replied the Queen, you shall not, I have a few questions to ask you; my
rudeness most unparalled Lady shall be as obedient to reply, as your Grace
shall be ready to demand, although I am unworthy to be the least of your
creatures. The Queen hearing him express himself with so much humility and
excellency of speech, the King forgetting that his Son was there, came
suddenly into the presence of the Queen, and beholding his outcast, started
back, the Queen perceiving it, desired the King to yield her so great a favor
as to stay to hear her ask his Son two or three questions, the King not using
to deny the request of such persons, sat down, whilst the Queen thus expressed
her self to Innocentine: Was it you that took my Eagle from me, pray answer me
without ceremony: To which he vowing himself replied, Madam I did, and what
token left you with me, or took from me? Madam, a lock of your hair, where is
it replied the Queen? next my heart, Madam, replied Innocentine, and here it
is; but what (...) leave me, said the Queen? a lock of mine replied Innocentine
(great Prince said the Queen to the King) and here it is; but pray let your
patience expect my further discourse with him come hither, said the Queen, to
vashful Innocentine, do you know this picture and this King? yes, Madam, and I
hope your greatness knows these (showing her the picture and the King which he
had took from her) come says the Queen, give me the picture, and instead of
the shadow, take the substance, I am resolved renowned King, not to depart,
till I have made him possessor of all I have, admire it not; for it is nothing
but truth. The King like a man transported, at first thought the Queen to be
possessed of a frenzy, but after more serious debate, found all truth which she
had related, and presently sent for his two Sons, Philonzo and Cruentine, and
commands their heads to be struck off, but Innocentine seconded with his
incomparable Lady, persuaded his Father to save their lives, and banish them;
which the King, though unwillingly consented to, after which he embraced his
Son, and told him, in requital of his great abuses, he would settle his Kingdom
upon him. The Queen joyful to see the King embrace his Son, desired the King
that hereafter he would please to own her as his obedient Daughter. So
Innocentine and the Queen were shortly after married and departed into their
own Country of Ivyland.

FINIS.
