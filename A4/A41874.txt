The Great Boobee.
To a pleasant New Tune: Or, Sallengers Round.


MY Friend, if you will understand
my Fortunes what they are,
I once had Cattle, House, and Land,
but now I am never the near;
My Father left a good estate,
as I may tell to thee,
I couzned was of all I had,
like a great Boobee.
I went to School with a good intent,
and for to learn my Book,
And all the day I went to play,
in it I never did look:
Full seven years, or very nigh,
as I may tell to thee,
I could hardly say my Christ-Cross-Row,
like a great Boobee.
My Father then in all the haste,
did set me to the Plow,
And for to lash the Horse about,
indeed I knew not how:
My Father took his Whip in his hand,
and soundly lashed me,
He called me Fool and Country Clown,
and great Boobee.
But I did from my Father run,
for I will Plow no more,
Because he had so slashed me,
and made my sides so sore:
But I will go to London Town,
some Vashions for to see,
When I came there they called me Clown
and great Boobee.
But as I went along the street,
I carried my Hat in my hand,
And to every one that I did meet,
I bravely bust my hand:
Some did laugh, and some did scoff,
and some did mock at me,
And some did say I was a Woodcock,
and a great Boobee.
Then did I walk in have to Paul's,
the Steeple for to view,
Because I heard some people say,
it should be builded new;
Then I got up unto the top,
the City for to see,
It was so high it made me cry,
like a great Boobee.
The second part, to the same Tune.
FRom thence I went to Westminster,
and for to see the Tombs,
Oh, said I, what a house is here,
with an infinite sight of Rooms?
Sweetly the Abbey Bells did ring,
it was a fine sight to see,
Methought I was going to Heaven in a string,
like a great Boobee.
But as I went along the street,
the most part of the day,
Many Gallants did I meet,
methought they were very gay:
I blew my Nose, and pist my Hose,
some people did me see,
They said I was a Beastly Fool,
and a great Boobee.
Next day I through Pye-corner past,
the Roast-meat on the Stall,
Invited me to take a taste,
my Money was but small:
The Meat I picked, the Cook me kicked,
as I may tell to thee,
He beat me sore, and made me rore,
like a great Boobee.
As I through Smithfield lately walked,
a gallant Lass I met,
Familiarly with me she talked,
which I cannot forget:
She proffered me a pint of Wine,
methought she was wondrous free,
To the Tavern then I went with her,
like a great Boobee.
She told me we were near of Kin,
and called for Wine good store,
Before the reckoning was brought in,
my Cousin proved a Whore:
My Purse she picked, and went away,
my Cousin couzned me,
The Vintner kicked me out of door,
like a great Boobee.
At the Exchange when I came there,
I saw most gallant things,
I thought the Pictures living were
of all our English Kings:
I doft my Hat, and made a Leg,
and kneeled on my Knee,
The people laughed, and called me Fool,
and great Boobee.
To Paris Garden then I went,
where there is great resort,
My pleasure was my punishment,
I did not like the sport:
The Garden Bull with his stout horns,
on high then tossed me,
I did bewray my self with fear,
like a great Boobee.
The Bear-heard went to save me then,
the people flockt about,
I told the Bear-garden-men,
my guts were almost out:
They said I stunk most grievously,
no man would pity me,
They called me witless Fool and Ass,
and great Boobee.
Then over the Water did I pass,
as you shall understand,
I dropped into the Thames alas,
before I came to Land:
The Water-man did help me out,
and thus thus did say to me,
It Is not thy fortune to be drowned,
like a great Boobee.
But I have learned so much wit,
shall shorten all my cares,
If I can but a Liscence get,
to play before the Bears:
'Twill be a gallant place indeed,
as I may tell to thee,
Then who dares call me Fool or Ass,
or great Boobee.
