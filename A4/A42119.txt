WHereas a Book Entitled, Musaeum Regalis Societatis, being not only a perfect
Catalogue of all the Rarities Natural and Artificial, belonging to the Royal
Society, and preserved at Gresham College.

But containing moreover large and full Descriptions of those Particulars,
which are either not at all, or falsely, or very defectively described in the
Musaeum's of Calceolarius, Septalius, Wormius, the College of the Jesuits at
Rome, of Monsieur Ferdinand Cospy, or by Aldrovandus, Rondeletius, Gesnerus,
Salvianus, or other Authors.

Whereunto the more especial Uses, Natural, Medicinal and Mechanical, and
diverse Experiments relating to them, are also added; all which will be
comprised in about Fourscore Printed Sheets:

Together with the Figures of such Particulars as are omitted by Others, to be
contained in about Twenty five half Sheets, wrought off from Copper Plates.

Whereto is also subjoyned a Treatise, Entitled, The Comparative Anatomy of
the Stomachs and Guts of about Thirty sorts of Animals; being several Lectures
read before the Royal Society; which will be contained in about Ten Printed
Sheets.

With the Figures of the said Parts; which will be contained in about Five half
Sheets, likewise wrought off from Copper Plates.

And both being, as at first undertaken upon the desire, so now to be Published
by the Order of the said Society.

IT is therefore Proposed by the Author, Doctor Nehemiah Grew, That whoever
Subscribeth for Six English Copies in Quires, or procures Subscriptions for so
many, shall receive seven such Copies Imprinted with a fair Letter, upon very
good Paper, in Folio. And he that Subscribeth for one, or any number under Six,
shall receive his Copy or Copies of the same Impression and Paper as abovesaid,
to be prized at no more than a penny per Sheet, and a penny per Plate; which, for
each Copy, will amount to about Ten shillings.

Every Subscriber or Procurer giving Notice to the said Doctor Grew of his
Subscription, or procured Subscriptions, at or before the Twentieth of April
next: For that it is intended the Copies shall not exceed the number of
Subscriptions.

And within Fourteen days after Public Notice is given to every Subscriber or
Procurer, That the Impression of the said Book is finished (which, God willing,
shall be within or before Michaelmas Term next) every Subscriber or Procurer to
give Order for the payment of the Subscription-Monies to the said Doctor Grew,
upon the Receipt of the said Copy or Copies, at his House near Warwick-Court in
Warwick Lane, London.

Note, That although the said Book be prized no higher than at about Ten
shillings, yet at the usual and ordinary price, of Books of this nature, it
will be worth about Eighteen shillings.
