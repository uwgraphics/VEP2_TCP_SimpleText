WHEREAS for sundry good Causes and Considerations, We have thought it
convenient and necessary to prorogue the present Parliament, until the one and
twentieth day of January next being Tuesday, when it is purposed (God willing)
the same shall be recontinued: We do therefore will and require all persons to
whom it does or shall appertain, to take due notice thereof, to the end, that
in the mean time they may repair to their Houses, or otherwise apply themselves
about their private Affairs, at their pleasures; and then to give their
attendance here again, at the day and time aforesaid, in the usual place
appointed for that intended service: Whereof they may not fail.
