A PROCLAMATION.
JAMES R.

WHereas in the time of the late Rebellion, We upon just Grounds gave Order for
the Apprehending of Henry Lord Delamere, to the end he might enter into
Security to Us for keeping of the Peace toward Us and Our Subjects during that
Rebellion; and although he had notice thereof, and was several times advertised
to Render himself, yet in Contempt of Our Authority, and to render Our Commands
for the Preservation of the Peace of Our Kingdoms ineffectual, did abscond
himself, and yet both abscond himself, contrary to the Duty of a good Subject,
whereby he has given Us good cause to suspect his Fidelity toward Us: We
therefore with the Advice of Our Privy Council, Do Command, Publish and Declare
by this Our Proclamation, That the said Henry Lord Delamere do within Ten days
after the Date hereof, Appear before Us in Our Privy Council, upon Pain of
being Proceeded against for his Contempt to Our Royal Commands, according to
the Laws of this Our Kingdom.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall the Nineteenth day of July 1685. In the First
Year of Our Reign.
LONDON, Printed by the Assigns of John Bill deceased: And by Henry Hills, and
Thomas Newcomb, Printers to the Kings Most Excellent Majesty. 1685.
