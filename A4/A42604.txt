POSTSCRIPT.
Courteous Reader,
IN this brief Catalogue, you have written as it were in short hand within the
compass of a penny, the Tragical and more then barbarous Cruelties, exercised
upon the true Protestant Clergy, as well within as without the Walls and
Liberties of London; As they were acted in good earnest by the Brethren of the
Presbytery, who now themselves cry out so much of Persecution. It is much
desired that some Ingenuous Persons in the several Counties of this Kingdom,
will collect and present to the World in larger Characters, a Catalogue
likewise of those Loyal Ministers, who in each respective County, have past
through the Presbyterian Furnace, which like Nebuchadnezzars Oven, was made
seven times hotter, then that into which Gods justice, and the peevishness of
their refractory Spirits, has now cast their merciless Persecutors.

Cursed be their wrath for it was fierce, and their rage for it was cruel; I
will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.

Genesis 49.7.
