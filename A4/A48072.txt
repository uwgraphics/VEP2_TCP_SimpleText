A LETTER From on Board Major General Kirk.
Giving a Full Account of the Posture of Affairs of Londonderry And their
Resolution to Hold out that Garrison for the Service of King William and Queen
Mary.
With a LIST of the Irish Forces, the Officers Slain, and Prisoners Taken.
Licensed, J. F. July 27. 1689.

SIR,
WE are all glad of the News you send us, of the speedy Succors designed to
join us. The River of Derry is so blocked and boomed up, that we cannot relieve
it by the River with our small Forces: however we have tried another Trick; we
have landed half our Forces at an Island called Inch, in Lough Swilley, which
is within Five Miles of the Enemies Camp, and have had good Success: There is
but one way to Ford it, which is about Musket Shot long; and our Men have
entrenched, and built a Redoubt, and have secured themselves well, and are
increased in their number with Protestants, above a thousand, and expect
greater numbers will join within five or six days, where we have Arms for them;
and to morrow all our Forces leave this place, and go thither, which terrifies
the Enemy very much, and had we but 500 Horse, we would not question to raise
the Siege. Our Men has already stockt their Island with a thousand Head of
Cattle, and expect to take many more. It Is a brave Island to refresh our Horses
Limbs, after their Sea-Voyage. We have sent Arms and Ammunition, with some
Forces, to the Protestants at Enniskilling, who are strong, 1500 good Horse,
one Regiment of Dragoons, four Regiments of Foot, of sixty in a Company, and
eighteen Companies in a Regiment; these will fight their way to us. I hope
Derry Men's Provision will hold out until they join with us. Enniskilling Men
have great Droves of Cattle and Provision with them; they have often been out
twenty Miles from home, and has beat the Enemy wherever they met them, and
have lately took Coll. Scot, with thirteen Officers, and three hundred
Soldiers, which were guarding Arms and Provisions, which all fell into their
Hands, and there were three thousand of them, but they fled at the first
Firing, and left those Provisions with 1000 French Arms. The Enemy, in all
appearance, if there were but any formidable Army against them, would certainly
be routed: They have in all their Attacks upon Derry received great losses,
that their Men are so bauked they desert in numbers.

The Messenger that went into Derry told me, That the People of Derry are in
good Heart, and that they have a Barrel of Powder made every day in the Town;
and that they treated him with Bread and good salt Beef, and strong Drink, and
drank King William and Queen Mary's Health heartily, and prayed for their
Prosperity, resolving never to trust a Papist, as having never kept his
Promise; and that if they had never so many Lives, they would sell them all for
the Protestant Interest.

The little Vessel that came to us from Liverpoole, being called the Wheel of
Fortune, set Sail out of that Port on the Tenth instant, and being in the Bay
of Carick fergus, heard great shooting, but coming out of the Bay, took a Boat
with Three Irish men, and Three Highlanders, having three Muskets, four
Skeanes, and four Swords, by whom they understood, that there was Three French
men of War, and that the shooting was for Joy they had taken the 2 Scotch
Frigates, the Men having behaved themselves very well, all refusing Quarter but
twelve; and that these Boat-men were going to the Highlands to fetch some of
Dundee's Followers Wives, to bring them to Ireland, believing Scotland not safe
for them.
