A Godly Ballad of the Just man JOB. Wherein his great patie^ ^ch declare* His
Plagues, and his Miseries* and yet did not dispare. The tune is, the Merchant.
WAlking alone.
Not long agone,
I heard one wail and weep,
Alas he said,
I am now laid,
in sorrow strong and deep.
To hear him cry,
I did apply,
and privily abode,
There did I find
In secret mind.
the Just and Patient Job.
His woeful pain
Did me constrain,
by force to wail and moan.
God did him prove,
How he did love,
the living Lord alone.
In heaviness
He did express
these words with bitter tears,
Alas, poor man,
Wretched I am'
in care my self out-wearde.
This mortal life
Is but a strife,
a battle great and strong,
My years also
Do waste and go,
and not continue long,
The day wherein
I did begin
to move and stir my breath,
Would God I had
An exchange made,
and turned unto death.
So should not I
In misery
be wrapped as I am,
The time and day
Well curse I may.
when to this world I came.
For my faults past,
I am outcast,
and of all men abhorred,
O that I might
Once stand in sight,
to reason with the Lord.
I should then know
Why he does show
this extreme cruelty.
Upon this flesh,
Which is but Grass,
and borne is for to dye.
From top to toe
I feel with woe.
that sorrow is my meat,
Put to exile,
With Botch and Bile.
and dunghill is my seat.
My kinsfolk talk,
And by me walk,
wondering at my fall,
They count my state
Unfortunate,
and so forsake me all.
My Children five,
Which were alive.
they all be quite destroyed,
The Plague fell
On my Cattle,
with all that I enjoyed.
Should I for them
My God blaspheme,
and his good gifts despise?
That will I not,
But take my lot.
giving his Name the praise.
They were not mine,
But for a time,
I know well it is so,
God gave them me,
Why should not he,
again take them me fro?
Thus having said,
Full still I staid,
his end for to behold,
I there did see
His felicity,
increasing manifold.
I knew well then,
How patient men,
should not suffer in vain,
But shall be sure
To have pleasure,
rewarde^ for their pain.
