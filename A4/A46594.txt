all other His Highnesses Dominions and Countries, as well in all Spiritual or
Ecclesiastical things or Causes, as Temporal; And that no Foreign Prince,
Person, Prelate, State, or Potentate, has or ought to have any Jurisdiction,
Power, Superiority, Preeminence or Authority Ecclesiastical or Spiritual within
this Realm: And therefore I do utterly renounce and forsake all Foreign
Jurisdictions, Powers, Superiorities and Authorities, and do promise that from
henceforth, I shall bear Faith and true Allegiance to the KING's Highness, his
Heirs and lawful Successors; and to my power shall assist and defend all
Jurisdictions, Privileges, Preeminences and Authorities granted or belonging
to the KING's Highness, his Heirs and Successors, or united and annexed to the

Sovereign Lord King JAMES is lawful and rightful King of this Realm, and of all
other His Majesty's Dominions and Countries; and that the Pope, neither of
himself, nor by any Authority of the Church or See of Rome, or by any other
means with any other, has any Power or Authority to depose the King, or to
dispose any of His Majesty's Kingdoms or Dominions, or to authorize any Foreign
Prince to invade or annoy him or his Countries, or to discharge any of his
Subjects of their Allegiance and Obedience to His Majesty, or to give License
or leave to any of them to bear Arms, raise Tumults, or to offer any violence
or hurt to His Majesty's Royal Person, State or Government, or to any of his
Majesty's Subjects within His Majesty's Dominions.

Also I do swear from my heart, that notwithstanding any Declaration, or
Sentence of Excommunication, or Deprivation made or granted, or to be made or
granted by the Pope or his Successors, or by any Authority derived or pretended
to be derived from him or his See, against the said King, His Heirs or
Successors, or any Absolution of the said Subjects from their Obedience, I will
bear Faith and true Allegiance to His Majesty, His Heirs and Successors, and
him and them will defend to the uttermost of my power, against all Conspiracies
and Attempts whatsoever which shall be made against his or their Persons, their

Subjects, or any other whatsoever.

And I do believe, and in my conscience am resolved, that neither the Pope, nor
any Person whatsoever has Power to absolve me of this Oath, or any part

administered unto me, and do renounce all Pardons and Dispensations to the
contrary.

no small number of people.

For Remedy wherein to be had, be it Enacted, Established and Ordained by the
Queens most Excellent Majesty, By the consents of the Lords Spiritual and
Temporal, and the Commons in this present Parliament assembled, and by the
Authority of the same, that the foresaid Master, Wardens and Assistants of the

And that all such Beacons, Marks, and signs, so to be by them, or their
Assigns erected, made, and set up at the Costs, and Charges of the said Master,

THE GRANT OF Queen ELIZABETH In the 36. Year of Her Reign, OF THE Ballastage,
Beaconage, and Buoyage, TO THE TRINITY-HOUSE.
ELIZABETH, By the Grace of God. Surrender of the Ballastage by the Lord
Admiral.
Queen of England, France, and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, etc. To all to
whom these present Letters shall come, Greeting: Whereas our loving Cousin and
Councellor, Charles Lord Howard of the most Noble Order of the Garter Knight,
Baron of Effingham, and our great Admiral of England, has by his Deed in our
Court of Chancery enrolled, bearing Date the seven and twentieth day of May
last past, for diverse considerations him therein moving, fully, wholly, and
absolutely Surrendered, yielded, and given up unto Us, and into our hands, the
Lastage and Ballastage, and Office of Lastage and Ballastage, of all and all
manner of Ships, and other Vessels whatsoever, coming, or being, in or upon the
River of the Thames, or which shall at any time hereafter be coming, Floting,
Issuing, passing, Sailing or going into, or out of the River of the Thames,
betwixt our City of London, and the Main Sea, of what burden soever such Ship
or Ships, or other Vessels shall be, and of, and by what Name, or Names soever,
such Ballastage and Lastage is, or may be called, known, or used, or which do
or hereafter shall remain, lie, or be, at, in, upon, or near unto any Wharf,
Bank, or Creek near unto the same River, or any Coast, Shore, or part of the
same, betwixt the Bridge of London toward the West part, and the said Main Sea
toward the East; And all his lawful Right, And Title to the same.
Title, Interest, and demand whatsoever which he has or might have, claim, or
pretend to have of, in, or to the premises, or any of them, by Virtue of the
said Office of Great Admiral of England, or of our Letters Patents, dated at
Westminster the eighth day of July in the seven and twentieth year of our
Reign, made unto him of the said Office of Great Admiral of England, or of any
Sentence or Clause therein contained or otherwise; Prays the Granting thereof
to the Trinity-House.
And has besought us that we will be pleased to Give, Grant and Confirm the
premises unto the Master, Wardens, and Assistants, of the Trinity-House of
Deptford-Strond in our County of Kent.

And whereas he has further by his said Deed of the date aforesaid also fully,
Surrenders also the Beaconage and Buoyage.
wholly, and absolutely, Surrendered, yielded, and given up unto us, and into
our hands, all his Right, Title, Interest, Authority, and demand whatsoever
which he has, or might have, Claim, Challenge, or pretend to have of, in, or
to the making, Erecting, Setting up, Placeing or Laying out of all, or any
Beacons, Buoyes, Marks, and Signs for the Sea, to be made, Erected, and Set up,
Placed, or laid forth, in, or upon the Sea or Sea-Shores, Coasts near the Sea,
or Vplands, or Forelands, or elsewhere near the Sea, by Virtue or Color of the
said Office of great Admiral of England, Letters Patents aforesaid, or
otherwise howsoever.

And has by his said Deed declared and made known, Declares the Right thereof
to be in Trinity-House, by Act of Parliament.
that albeit by the Letter of our said Letters Patents aforesaid, the said
Beaconage, and other the last recited premises are granted unto him, Yet it
does notwithstanding evidently appear unto him, that it is in and by one
Statute or Act of Parliament, made in the Eighth Year of Our Reign, specially
and expressly Ordained and Enacted, that the said Master, Wardens, and
Assistants of the Trinity-House of the Deptford Strond aforesaid being a
Company incorporated, should and might lawfully by Virtue of the said Act, from
time to time, at their Wills and Pleasures, and at their Costs and Charges,
make, Erect, and Set up, such, and so many Beacons, Marks, and Signs for the
Sea, in such Place, or Places of the Sea-shores, and Vplands near the Sea
Coasts, or Forelands of the Sea, for Seamarks, as to them shall seem most meet,
needful and requisite, whereby dangers may be avoided and escaped, and Ships
the better come to their Ports without Peril: But for that the placing, and
laying out of Buoyes in convenient Places of the Sea, and Channel, for passing
into and out of Havens, and Rivers, being a thing most necessary to forewarn,
shun, and prevent the Peril and danger of those places may yet be questioned
upon, by the strict Letter of the said Statute, Not fully enough expressed in
the said Act.
or Act of Parliament, for that the said Buoyes be properly and naturally
placed and laid out upon or within the Water of the Sea-Haven or River, and not
on the Seashore, or Banks dry at any time, and does therefore justly deserve
some explanation.

In regard of which premises he does further by his said Deed of the date
aforesaid, humbly also beseech us, Prays therefore a further confirmation, and
explanation thereof.
that we will be further pleased to give, grant, confirm, and explain, in all
ample and beneficial manner, unto the said Master, Wardens, and Assistants of
the Trinity-House of Deptford Strond aforesaid, and their Successors for ever,
the making, erecting, setting up, placing, and laying out, continuing,
renewing, and maintaining, from time to time, of all and every Beacon and
Beacons, Buoy and Buoyes, Mark and Marks, Sign and Signs for the Sea, which at
the time of the making the said Deed, were, or at any time hereafter shall be

River of Thames, the Owners whereof will not submit to the Government of the
Company of VVatermen, nor any other Regulation whatsoever; But under pretense
of Fetching Dirt, and Furnishing necessary Provisions on Board such Ships as
are in the River, do commit diverse Thefts and Robberies, and practice several
other Insufferable Misdemeanors, and sometimes endanger the Fireing His

informed, That diverse of His Majesty's Subjects have of late presumed to wear

without difficulty distinguished there from; Which practice is found attended
with manifold Inconveniences: For prevention whereof for the future His Majesty
has thought fit, with the Advice of His Privy Council, by this His Royal
Proclamation, strictly to Charge and Command all His Subjects whatsoever. That

the Commissioners for Executing the Office of Lord High Admiral for the time
being; And His Majesty does hereby further Command all His Loving Subjects,
That without such Warrant as aforesaid, they presume not to wear on board their
Ships or Vessels, any Iacks made in imitation of His Majesty's, or any other
Flags, Iacks or Ensigns whatsoever, then those usually heretofore worn on
Merchants Ships, viz. The Flag and Jack white, with a Red Cross, (commonly
called Saint George's Cross) passing quite through the same; And the Ensign
Red, with the like Cross in a Canton White, at the upper Corner thereof next to
the Staff.

And His Majesty does hereby require the principal Officers and Commissoners of
His Navy, Governors of His Forts and Castles, the Officers of his Customs, and
Commanders or Officers of any of His Majesty's Ships; or upon their meeting
with, or otherwise observing any Merchants Ships or Vessels of His Majesty's
Subjects wearing such a Flag, Jack, or Ensign contrary hereunto, whether at
Sea, or in Port, not only to cause such Flag, Jack, or Ensign to be forthwith
Seized, but to return the Names of the said Ships and Vessels, together with
the Names of their respective Masters, unto the Lord High Admiral, Lords
Commissioners of the Admiralty, or the Judge of the High Court of Admiralty for
the time being, to the end the persons offending may be duly Punished for the
same.

And His Majesty does hereby Command and Enjoin the Judge and Judges of the
High Court of Admiralty for the time being, that at the several Sessions to be
hereafter held by His Majesty's Commission of Oyer and Terminer for the
Admiralty, they give in Charge, that strict enquiry be made of all Offenses in
the Premises, and that they cause all offenders therein to be duly punished:
And all Vice-Admirals, and Judges of Vice-Admiralties, are also to do the same,
and to attend the due observation hereof within the several Ports and Places of
their respective Precincts.
