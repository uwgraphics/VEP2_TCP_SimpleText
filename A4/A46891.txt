A Job for a Ioyner OR A good Workman well employed,
This Maid must have a workman come in have
Because she could not live no longer chaste,
And John the Joyner is the Man must do
Her Job and make the bed go Jigg a Jog go
Tune of, Over the water, fain I would pass, or Jig a Jog-goo, etc.


COme and attend young Virgins all
A Country Damsel caught a fall
And so perhaps may one of you
When you make your bed go Jigg a Jog goo.
But yet such falls so harmless are
Breaking of Bones you need not fear
When e're you try you will find it true,
If you make the bed go Jigg a Jog-goo.
Then mark me well and you shall hear
A pretty story in your Ear,
Which I lay open to your view,
O'th bed was made to go Jigg a Jog-goo,
There was a Maid came out of Kent
And to be kissed was her intent,
A Ioyners Job she had to do
To make her bed go Jigg a Jog-goo.
She hearing of a lusty Lad
Who was a workman of his Trade
She sent him word to come and view
And make her bed go Jigg a Jog goo.
Qu^th she sweet John make have to me
And fear not but we will agree,
I ever to thee will prove true
If thou makes my bed to go Jigg a Jog-goo*
John strait way like an honest man
Packt up his tools and went to Nan,
He asked for the Mal^ had a Job to do
To make her bed go Jigg a Jog-goo.
Nan heard his voice and down she came
Her workman for to entertain,
She smiling said O is it you
Can make my bed go Jigg a Jog-goo.
YOu a^e the only man it is said
that can do wonde^s for a Maid,
Dis^a^ch then what you have to do
And make my bed ^o go Jigg a Jog goo.
(...) like a workman (...) my hand
I Nan will be at the c^mma^d,
And to m^ ^romise I Will be true
If thou makes my bed go Jigg a Jog goo.
Nan having g^ve her hand to John
Qu^th he ^he must (...),
I (...) I can do
To make thy bed go Jigg a Jog goo.
O then (...) Nan
I Would have it done as soon as you can,
With Roses I my bed will strew
If thou make it to go Jigg a Jog goo.
Quoth John, rar^ tools I with me brought
My (...) in this kin^ has wrought,
For many a Maid to me did sue
To make their beds go Jigg a Jog goo.
Never fear but I have learned my trade
I know well how to please a Maid,
And sure i will please thee e're I ^o
And make thy bed go Jigg a Jog goo.

Then John unto his work did fall
And Nan she played at Vptails all,
He n^at^y did his b^siness do
And made her bed go Jigg a Jog goo.
Nan commended John for his Art
And John thankt Nan with all his heart
They both were pleased with what you know
For he made the bed go Jigg a Jog goo.
Her Mother she came f^ll of woe,
O (...) Daughter why would you do so
Does this with modesty agree
To make your bed go Jigg a J^g gee.
Had ^ou advse'd wi^h me no doubt
I might have found a workman out
Should have done you Job as well as he
To make your bed go Jigg a Jogg gee.
O ^hen repl^'^ her Daughter Nan
Mother this is the only Man,
I had a mind that none but he
Should make my bed go Jigg a Jog gee.
The World sings of this work-mans fame
And John the Ioyner is his Name,
He did it well as well might be
And made my bed go Jigg a Jog gee.
