PLUS ULTRA OR THE SECOND PART Of the Character of a QUAKER WITH Reflections on
a Pitiful Sheet, Pretended to be an Answer to the Former.

-- DA Iustum Sanctumque videri
Noctem Peccatis and Fraudibus objice nubem;
If that my Deeds of Darkness may
Be wrapped in Clouds as black as they?
If being ugly I may paint
Oh! then I am a true new Saint;

PLUS ULTRA OR The Second part of the Character of a QUAKER.
A QUAKER is an Everlasting Argument; For like Afrique he is daily Teeming with
some new Monster: He that can describe him fully may boast he has squared the
Circle. To term him Gomorrah-Apple, Painted Tomb, or varnisht Rottenness does
not reach him; He is rather an Apothecahries guilt Box, inscribed with the
glorious Title of some Elixar, but filled with Arsenicke or worser Venom; A
dull lump wherein Lucifer has played Prometheus's part; For of him the Apostle
is a Prophet, His tongue is set on fire of Hell; The Materia Prima of this
Religious Crocodile is a certain Natural Melancholy or sullen discontent; And
his animating form, Pride and singularity blended: His looks and habit cry;
Pray observe me, and his whole deportment is starched and affected, you may
take his Face, for a new fashioned Sun-Dyal where the forced wrinkles represent
Hower-Lines, and his Tunable Nose the Gnomon: He is oft-times as lean as
Famine, yet not out of abstinence but Envy, and his paleness is rather the
Paint of his Hypocrisy, than any effect of Mortification: He is commonly in
his Youth a professed Practitioner in all kind of Luxury: And as soon as shame or
the smarting products of his debaucheries awaken him, to think of amendment;
the Devil hurries him into the contrary extreme, teaching him to scruple the
most innocent things, that he may with the better Gloss perpetrate those that
are abominable. Henceforwards he shuts the Devil out at the Gate, and lets him
in at the back door, becomes at once Bigot and Impious, and weaves with the
thread of his life a mixed stuff of Superstition and Atheism. To ask, what it
is a Clock he counts the Language of Ashdod, and you were as good speak Arabic
as say Here Is to you Sir, his Religion is nothing but Phrases, being a
superstitious observer of new Minted Modes of speaking, whereby he commits an
absurdity, yet tells a Truth when he calls the most wicked and flagitious
friends, when he lies with his Neighbors wife, it is not out of Lust, but only
to raise up a faithful seed. And if he wants Money, he need only say to one of
his Gang, The Lord has sent me to borrow of thee forty Shillings: He sometimes
studies the Law that he may violate it with the fairer pretenses: And reads the
Bible only to furnish himself with Scripture-names to call those he intends to
quarrel with, Reprobate Child of Perdition, Son of Belial etc. If he have any
smattering in learning; Fiddlers, Perriwigmakers or Tirewomen love him, not
worse than his quondam Schoolmaster; who indeed with reason calls him
ungrateful: Since he Scorns to own whence he sucked that little stock of
Pedantry. For he impudently braggs Heaven sent it him, to rights for a token;
He therefore damns Humane learning in general, and cries it puffs up; yet
devoutly admires those humble ones of his own cast; who lately to ostentate the
Prodigiosity of their Parts, obliged the World with a Battle-Door in two and
twenty languages on no more serious occasion than to teach us to Thou people
learnedly: He reverenceth the Memory of Fox and Nailor, but mentions Peter and
Paul as familiarly as if they were his fellows, he cannot allow them the Title
of Saints, yet boasts himself enthroned in a state of perfection: If he ever
fasts it is on some Festival, and Resents no Idolatry so Heinous as not opening
Shop on Christmas day; He defyes its superstitious Plumbroth, and will rather
surfeit on Mince Pyes any other time then touch one then; when he has a mind to
be cross, he cries he is not free, and with a solemn verily puts off:
unsuspected the veriest Lies imaginable: There is certainly some want of
Symmetry in his Head which makes him hate all Harmony: Yet at their
Conventicles you may fancy a kind of Music: For the Men and Women sighing and
groaning in consort make an odd noise like the great and small Pipes of an
Organ; he cannot perform a Religious Exercise without a fit of Railing as well
as Quaking: He is most Sagacious at Damning Folks, and delights in cursing as
much as good men do in blessing, his very Preaching is a Satyr, and the most
zealous of his talk a malicious Invective against all that are not as mad as
himself. Yet still you must believe him meek and lowly; For when he has
outdone Billinsgate for Scurrility and opprobrious Terms, he tells you it is
only his earnest contending for the truth; His Doctrine is a Gospel of about
thirty Years standing, and he is a Christian without Baptism or Ordinance,
Creed or Catechism in Germany he is called a Paracelsian, and some wantons of
the Family of love first dropped the Brat in our Streets; Indeed he is a
Religious Proteus so slipperie no Definition can hold him, for by keeping the
main body of his Opinions in Hugger Mugger, and displaying or concealing them,
as he spies advantages he reserves always a Hole for retreat: So that if you
insist on any Blasphemous Tenet, or extravagant Prank, he stops your Mouth with
Alas! Friends never owned it; Thus whereas the Ancient Apostles did preach up
Faith, Hope, Love, Righteousness, Peace and Joy in the Holy Ghost: These new
Seers ramble about to establish certain little Fopperies, as if the Salvation
of the World depended on the preaching down Points, Cuffs, Tyth pigs and
Pulpit-Hower-Glasses: He is a kind of Spiritual Gipsy that describes Grace and
Piety by the Lines of the Physiognomy, and confines Christianity to such a
Complexion or Habit, being confident, that cannot be a Wedding Garment that
has any trimming: Thus Ambition makes him affect a ridiculous Humility. And he
is proud by Antiperistasis --

-- So Beggars boast their rags, and may deride
The Pomp of Kings, but with a greater Pride
Meekness consists not in the clothes but Heart
Nature may be vain glorious, well as Art:
We may as lowly, before GOD appear
Dressed with an Orient Pearl, as with a tear
In his high presence, where the Stars and Sun
Do but Eclipse, there is no Ambition:
Glory can never render GOD the less,
Neither can Beauty defile holiness:
What Is more magnificent than Heaven, yet where
Is there more love and Piety than there?
But stay -- We must proceed with Caution though a Quaker defyes the Battoon
and temporal Sword, he is a parlous Gamester at the Goose-quill: It Is no small
attempt to encounter a Party whose impious Penn has presumed to Duel the
Sacred Trinity; Behold! the old muddy Style is laid by, and an Answer comes
reaking with Fumes of Babylonish Rhetoric: The Libeller Characterized;
Monstrum Horrendum! would it not prove a Second poison to Overbury, and startle
Cleavelands Ghost to see Yea and Nay, write Characters? It seems our
Pettifogging Friend T. R. stands always pressed to rail in the behalf of his
Faction, and ready for a Fee to Stigmatize all that would expose them: A most
fit Advocate for such a Cause, who cannot conceal himself if he would, for at
First view his Ears shoot out of his Skin, and present him perfect Ass, his
Pamphlet is fronted with a Bull-rampant, and he posts himself for a Libeller in
the Title Page, whilst he calls it, the Libeller Characterized by his own hand.
Trust me, I cannot but pity the Fools Disease, he has got a Flux of Gall, or
a certain Splenetick Looseness, which turns his Excrements the wrong way and
his Mouth Stools: Do but observe I pray! How the Galled Fade winces, I find
there is no giving him a Drench for the Staggers without Barnacles, you may
know by the Beasts tearing and foaming, our Arrows stick in his Sides, our
former Draught has touched him to the quick, and now like a Woman grown old and
ugly, he throws Stones at the Glass that shows him his own Deformity, he would
make us believe; that it is Christian to cheat ones Neighbor, provided it be
done in Scripture Language, and confess his own Sobriety is but an Appearance,
whilst he Cloaks with a Modest Dress Impieties that a virtuous Pagan would
blush at: He makes Conscience the Stalking-Nag over which he hopes securely to
give Fire at any Game, and being a worthless terrae-filius himself, envies
others those civil honors due to their Quality and merits. His talk of the
Resurrection and Souls immortality is to be construed according to some mental
Reservation, or else he speaks contrary to his Principles, and his good word
for the Innocent Protestants is only a Copy of his countenance.

When he mentions Christ he does it Allegorically, and with an Equivocation,
and to Preach the Light (in his sense) must needs be insignificant Babble,
since he affirms all men have Light sufficient already within them: He counts
his impudent Huffing Court of Judicature to be only a demand of civil Liberty,
and sawcily calls Acts of Parliament the decrees and SicVolo's of a private
Cabal, he wipes his Mouth to create an Opinion of his chastity, yet (like a
Young Wench when she hears a wanton Jest) lets us know by his Simpering that he
understands Tokens of Letchery, But what need he keep Concubines at Home, when
every Conventicle serves for a Seraglio: He counts all them Haters of Gods
worship that condemn his Disobedient Froliques at Devonshire House, and having
made it his business to divide and distract, wonders any should turn
Incendiaries, he preferrs a corner conveniently, or the base Multiplicamini of
a Midnight meeting before the Churches grave manner of Solemnizing Marriage,
and thinks the Priests Fee may be better bestowed on a provocative Posset for
carrying on the work of Generation: The patience, meekness and self-denial of
the Quaking Spirit is sufficiently apparent in this Hair-brained Scribler,
whose work is indeed a true Character of his Party, whilst mad with rage he
Belches out, he cares not what, against he knows not whom; But we shall take no
further notice of this Puisne Libeller then to laugh at his folly, and will
leave our shivering Hypocrite to his End; which (if he escape turning open
Ranter) is without repentance to go to IIell in a Saints Livery, and Steal his
own Damnation.

FINIS.
A Postscript to the Reader.
AS Gamesters that once luckily have thrown
Proceed and fondly think Fortune their own,
Till the perfidious Dice their hopes betray
And force them to go Moneyless away:
So the Author having swept the Stakes of late
Is tempted once again to set to's Fate,
The First Part did your kind Acceptance meet
It Is hoped you so too will this Second greet;
But if you prove more sullen now than then,
May you never be in good humor again,
But turn Quakers, and so at Bedlam bave
An Asses Burial, an unpittied Grave.
