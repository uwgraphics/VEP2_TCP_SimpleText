Noble and virtuous the Lady FRANCES his Wife, I humbly dedicate these ensuing
endeavors in the LORD.

AN APPENDIX UNTO THE Homily against IMAGES IN Churches
NEither an Idleness nor yet a rashness can it be esteemed in any under the
Government of the Church of England to write or speak against the Images; the
pronenesse of the Times to advance them, making it rather an act of necessity
then of idleness to oppose them; and the expresnesse of our Church doctrine
against them making ^t rather an act of Authority then of rashness utterly to
deface them. How express and positive the doctrine of our Church is against
them, our English Homily entitled Against the peril of idolatry, abundantly
declares; And that sufficiently in any of these ensuing parcels thereof: As
first in these words:

To conclude, It appears evidently by all Stories, and writing, and
experience, that neither preaching, neither writing, nor the consent of the
Learned, nor the Authority of the Godly, nor the Decrees of Councils, nor the
Laws of Princes, nor extreme punishment of the offenders in that behalf, nor
any other remedy or means can help against Idolatry if Images be suffered
publicly: Libro Homil. Tom. 2. Homil. 2. part. 3. p. 60. Impres. ult.

Secondly, left we should think that it excepted only against Heathen images,
it adds further in these words:

All those names of abomination, which God^ Word in the holy Scripture gives
unto the Idols of the Gentiles, the same appertain also to our Images set up in
our Churches, and unto the makers and maintainers thereof, page 80.

And finally, lest we should think that it did except only against the Images
of ordinary and inferior persons, and not against the Images of Canonized
Saints and persons of special reckoning, it has a proviso to that purpose in
these words:

The Images of God, our Savior, the Virgin, the Apostles, Martyrs, and others
of notable holiness, are of all others the most dangerous, and therefore of
all other, greatest care ought to be had hat none of them be suffered to stand
publickely in Temples and Churches. page 66.

On the other side, what a pronenesse there is in the Times to advance them
this alone may be argument sufficient, in that, notwithstanding the so
peremptory determination of our Church against them, they be nevertheless
still retained, and also, for one pretense or other more and more multiplied
and advanced. In this therefore so palpable a Schism betwixt doctrine and
practice, my duty binding me, and my judgment serving me to side with the
doctrine, my desire is to exercise my pen as my Title imported; and my purpose
is to confine my pains unto the making answer unto only two of those
allegatio^s, which use to be made in the behalf of Church-images, and they
shall be these:

1 That Images do greatly adorn and beautify Churches.

2 That they furnish the dead with Tombs and Monuments.

For though it also use to be pleaded in their behalf, that they are special
good to give instruction, and also toward the quickening of devotion: yet
because we have already (toward the vindication of the second Commandment)
made particular answers unto those allegations; we will wholly for this time
confine our selves unto those two premised.

1 To the first of them, then, which pleads how greatly they adorn and
beautify Churches, we answer;

First, that in the prophecy of Esaias the Lord says thus; Esaias 30.22.
Ye shall defile the covering of thy graven Images of silver, and the ornament
of thy molten Images of gold; thou shall cast them away as a menstruous cloth,
thou shall say unto them get thee hence: And in the prophecy of Ezechiel we
read thus; Ezech. 7 20.
As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty: but they have made
the Images of their abominations, and of their detestable things therein.

Secondly, it is a necessary condition in an ornament that it be without
scandal; but Images in Churches are not without scandal: therefore Images in
Churches are no Ornaments. Touching the ground of this our argument, namely
that Ornaments must not be scandalous, it is no more then the general rule of
Justice does require. For life must always be preferred before beauty, as
Matthew. 6.
life is more worth then meat, and the body then raiment: whereupon it fairly
follows that the things which inda^ger life, especially the spiritual life,
must rather be forborne then the things which serve only for beauty and
ornament, procured therewith: yea, the Apostle esteems it a (...)
warn of Charity if a man had not rather sometime part with his food then be
the cause of another man's sin. Now that Images are scandalous things in
Churches, it is many ways apparent. For (first) there being an unreasonable
pronenesse in the heart of man to sin by Images, even to the bowing down unto
them, and committing spiritual fornication with them; It must needs be that
the setting up such kind of sights in those kind of places where persons that
are spiritually incontinent are allowed (yea and bound) to repair, will prove
a palpable incensment and provocation thereunto; especially when as such kind
of pollution is apt to be committed through the mere aspect of the outward
Eye, and that without the privity or knowledge of the nearest slander by.
Surely if incontinent persons should be invited unto such kind of houses as had
every corner stuffed with bagages for such purposes, and such also as were not
able to say the^ nay (for such kind of things wear sure are Images) were it not
a most ready way to provoke such kind of iniquity? Secondly we read in the
prophet Ezechiel that when Ezech. 23.14, 15. etc,
the people of Israel did see the Images of the Caldea^s portrayed upon the
City walls, girded with gir^les about their loins, exceeding ^ dyed attire like
Princes, etc. ^^ey entered into the Bed of love with them: And therefore when
our people shall see the images, not of Infidels and profane persons, but of
most holy Saints, in like manner pourtrayed, and that not upon common walls, but
upon he walls and most eminent places of holy Temples, Is it not to be feared
that spiritual dotage will ensue thereupon even to the entering into the Bed of
love with them? For admit that the dotage of those Isralites which the prophet
report of was not upon the Images but upon the persons which those Images did
represent: yet when such persons were once dead, or so far distant as that
their lover^ could not enjoy them, will not the dotage in the end rather double
it self upon the Image then any way expire^ or abate? Thirdly, to attribute
unto Images the name and title of Church-ornaments, is a ready way to confer
holiness upon them: For if the Temple be holy, shall not the ornaments of the
Temple challenge holiness? Scandalous therefore it must needs be, if not
plainly idolatrous, to give so much as the term of Church-ornaments (...)
^ages. Fourthly, to ^mages in our English ^es must needs be ^ous, in a
special man^nely, for that the au^ed Doctrine of our ^h is most palpably ^ned
by the means. ^e Book of Homilies, in Church Images are ^emptorily determined
^, not only is at this ^ full force, but also a^ fourscore years since
^^mpiled, and ever since ^ been, both by Convo^ ^s confirmed, by Parlia^
established, and by Vi^ from time to time in^ed, and finally by a Su^ ^e Edict
(not twenty years since) prescribe^ pattern and Boundary for Preachers and
Minister; ^ are not they, then, culp^ of capital Scandal w^ will contrary
those Hom^ within the bounds of ^ Government where ^ have bin so long authori^^
Or is there any thing (...) scandalous (not to say (...) pestilent and impious)
the ^ contemn Authority? ^ly, they are in an other re^ most scandalous within
^ Bounds of England, nam^ for that they afford a pro^^ble plea for Recusancy; ^
may not the Recusant (...) plead; It is impossible t^ void Idolatry in those
Ch^ ^here Images are suffe^ the judgment of your ^ly; But in your English
^^hes, Images are suffe^ ^^erefore it is impossible ^id Idolatry in your ^h
Churches, by the ^ment of your Homily: ^ave we not then good ^ to refrain
your Chur^ Sixthly, the Lord ex^ tells us, that (...) 6.7.
his shall be called the house of ^; But what more of^ ^e unto prayer then the
^^tes of the outward eye? ^ therefore shutting (or ^ng) their eyes when they ^e
to be fervent at that ex^* For the invisible God (...) though otherwise never
s^ lawful, being bound to giv^ place to scandal, wherewit^ nothing but
necessity (against which there is no remedy) i^ able to dispense. Indeed i^
there were any kind of necessity for the setting up Image in Churches we
grant tha^ scandalousnesse were no suff^cient exception against them* But who
ever pleaded any kind of necessity for any kin^ of Images in Churches* For we
may both sing an^ say, hear, preach, and pra^ (which are all the Church duties
of necessity requirable) not only without the help of Images, but als^
without the help of our ve^^ but also without the help of our very eyes and
though we were stark blind. Secondly, ^dmit there were a necessity ^f outward
ornature in a Temple, yet is there no ne^essitie of Images for such a ^urpose:
witness that so beautiful Temple of Solo^on which had not an Image to be
seen (though in those Typical times) in that part of the Temple where the
Congregation assembled. Wit^esse also our Book of Homilies, which though it
admits of no Images in Chur^hes, yet has it a special ^omily entitled Tim. 2
hom. 3.
for the comely ^dorning of Churches. We conclude therefore, since Images are so
scandalous sights in Churches, and no kind of necessity does enforce the
setting up of any kind of Images in Churches; therefore they must not be set
up in Churches for mere ornament sake; all ornature though never so lawful
being a matter of redundance, and not of necessity; things being apt to be
sound and substantial, though beautiful they be not.

3 A third Argument against the allegation shall be this; All ornature is a
kind of beauty; and al beauty is Plotia. En. 2.6.
Flos formae resultantis in materia, that is, such a kind of flourish (...)
does result out of the fulness and ^^perabundance of inward vigor: ^t being
otherwise no true beauty indeed, but only a kind of Jay-like, furtive, and
^surped weed; or like the ^uddy tincture of a face which proceeds not from the
^ife and spirit of the face, but only from some outward fal^ification and
infection upon the Face. If therefore these Images be any true ornaments unto
Temples they must proceed from the peculiar nature and property of a Temple.
But do they so? Can they grow out of no ^tones but the stones of Temples? Can
they hang upon no walls but the walls of Temples? Yea, what walls so common,
rotten, or profane, but Images can be content to be playstered upon them,
hanged and drawn round about them? they being indeed the very Sperme and
spawne of places most contrary unto Temples, namely, the Temples of Idolaters;
Quorum (as a Lacters. 2.^.
Father says) quanto sunt ornatiora templa, and pulchriora simulachra, tant^
plus majestatis haebe^e creduntur: that is, Whose Temples the more adorned they
are, and the more goodly their Images, the more majesticall they are supposed.
The Scripture also testifying as much when it tells us, how the Heathens boasted
that Esaias 10 10.
their Images did excel the Images of Jerusalem and Samaria: As also when it
^ermeth Idolatry Nah^m 3 4.
a wel-favord ^arlot, it gives us to understand, that mere outward and forged
beauty is a Robe most proper to Idolatry: whereof our Homily gives a fair
reason when it says, Tom. 2. ^^mil. p. 3.
That Idolatry being of her self an old, foul, ^lihy and withered Harlot, and
understanding her lack of true ^aturall beauty, does paint, and deck, and tire
her self with gold, ^arle, stone, and all kind of pre^ious Jewels, the better
to please and entice her foolish lovers, etc.

4 Fourthly, it is a necessary condition unto an ornament, that it be
delightful in the eyes of those for whom it is intended. For all ornature and
beauty is a kind of excellency; and excellency does suppose and require a
degree of goodness more then mere necessity does enforce. Now there being
three degrees of goodness, namely, lawfulness, profitablenesse, and
delightsomnesse; and the two first being of necessity required in every thing
that is admitted into a Temple; It follows that nothing can be esteemed for an
ornament in a Temple, unless it has that third degree of goodness, namely,
delightsomenesse. And that the two first of these degrees namely lawfulness
and profitablenesse are of necessity required in every thing that is endured
in a Temple, it is easy to declare. For first, unless a thing be lawful, it
is not in any place to be endured, whether in a Temple or without the Temple;
Inhonestum and Impossible being esteemed all one, in moral estates. And then
in the second place unless it be also profitable it must not be allowed in a
Temple, even by that rule of Scripture which appoints that 1 Cor. 14.
All things in Churches be done to edifying: though our Homily does not
attribute unto Images in Churches, so much as profitablenes, when it says,
Tom. 2. homi^. 2. p. 3.
Such decking of Temples has nothing profited the wise, but greatly hurt the
simple and unwise. And therefore the things which have not attained unto that
third degree of goodness, namely delightsomnesse, cannot be reputed amongst
ornaments within the compass of Churches. It is true indeed and easily
granted, that Images in time and place are delightful enough; the Scripture
also acknowledging so much when it upbraideth the people by their Esaias. 2.16.
pleasing pi^tures; they being pleasing ^ights in the eyes of flesh and ^loud,
even when the beholder does not know what they mean; -- Rerumque ignarus
imagine gaudet, says the Poet: But the things which are delightful at one
time are not of necessity delightful at all times; and in all places. For
such we know ^s the force of time, place, persons, and other circum^tances, as
that the things which at one time are never ^o delightful, may at another time
be most hateful by their means. Yea, things that are never so lawful, may by
the power of circumstance be found unlawful and intolerable. Surely to hire a
farm, prove oxen, marry wives, etc. are no doubt in themselves lawful enough:
But when the Redeemers marriage cannot be celebrated unless those kind of
businesses be omitted: then do they become culpable of impiety and high
contempt. Likewise to receive money, Vineyards, Olive Trees, etc. are actions
in themselves lawful enough; But when the minding such matters might have
hazarded the conversion of that Syrian Prince, was it then a time for Gehezi to
receive money, Vineyards, Olive Trees, etc? Before therefore that it be granted
that Images are delightful sights in Churches, it must first be resolved
whether the circumstances do concur which are necessary toward the making a
thing delightful, or not: And amongst those Circumstances one of them is this;
Seasonablenesse and Sutablenesse. For though necessity does not stand upon it,
whether a thing be in Season or out of Season; yet pleasure and delight are of
that ticklenesse and delicacie as the unless the Season concurres it will not
take: Ecclesiasticus 22.
A tale out of Season being like music in mourning; and candidus in Nauta
turpis color; a fair face though in it self so pleasing a sight, yet in a
Sayler, or in a person whose profession it is to wrestle with the weather, it
is thought an ill-favored sight, and no better then a Ring of Gold in a Swines
snowt: As on the contrary, Dustie faces in Soldiers ( Flacc.
non indecoro pulvere sordidis) when they return from the chase of their
enemies, are sights not uncomely. Say then; are Images such seasonable sights
in Churches? or are they so suitable unto such kind of places? Things which are
so discrepant from the nature of God, and so apt to provoke the jealousy of
God as we have formerly noted, are such things so seasonable sights in the
Houses of God? Things which do so distemper and confound prayer, are such
things so seasonable in the Houses of Prayer? Surely when a man after a weary
journey has taken up his lodging, and is fallen into a sweet sleep; If some of
his neighbors should come and awake him, only to bid him good morrow, were that
a seasonable good morrow? Or while a man is waiting to put up a petition unto
his Prince, if some of his companions should come and call him to a May game,
were that a seasonable motion? Even ^o likewise when all the powers of the
mind lie couching at the door of the heart, whereby to attain some glance of
the invisible God; Shall those be seasonable sights which do allure those
powers and spirits an other way, even to the door of the outward Eye?

But we expect it will be objected, that howsoever unto some kind of
dispositions, such kind of sights will not be acceptable, nor worthy to be
reckoned amongst Church ornaments, yet because our vulgar, and little ones, do
not stand upon such nice respects, as Seasonablenesse and Sutablenesse, but are
apt to be taken with their delights wheresoever they find them: Therefore
toward the better alluring such little ones unto Gods Houses, it may stand with
good discretion and policy to set forth those Houses with such kind of sights,
and consequently to esteem those kind of sights amongst Temple ornaments:
whereunto we answer that such kind of persons as are not able to discern
betwixt the Houses of Prayer and the Houses of pleasure, are too little to be
reckoned amongst Gods little ones; the lock and not the key being ordained for
such manner of persons; For if the Guest was worthily thrust out of the Wedding
Feast, which refused to put on the wedding garment; How much more worthy shall
they be, to be thrust out of the Spiritual Feast, which not only neglect to
put on the Spiritual garment, but also resort unto those Feasts of purpose,
that they may the more li^entiously wallow in their sensual garment. Yea, mere
natural men have been more divinely minded then so; and have apprehended a far
more noble beauty then that which the outward Eye (...) capable of: It having
been ^n ancient Proverb amongst them, Hesperus and Vesperus, ^e. The Morning
and Eve^^ng Star are nothing so beau^^full as Virtue (yea, but one ^f the
Virtues Justice) was: and that Virtute nihil for^s^us, nihil amabilius, nihil
^chrius, etc. And concern^^g the beauty of a Temple, ^^e of their Poets could
say; ^re^. lib. 2.
Sed nil dulcius est been quam munita tueri
Edita doctrina sapientum Templa serena.


Another also of them af^^ming that the things which their gods most delighted
in were Pers. Sat. 2.
Compositumjus, fasque anim^ sanct que recessus
Mentis, and incoctum generos^ pectus honesto:


In comparison whereo^ (says he further) all you^ golden and glorious
offering are no better then Veneri donatae a Virgin Puppae. And therefore if
Infidels and Heathens are able to imagine a kind of beauty which goes far
beyond all outward eye-beauty: Shall it be supposed that any of the Believers
(the least whereof must be supposed far more divine^y minded then the ripest
un^eliever) are so apt to be al^red unto the Temples of ^he only and invisible
God ^y the means of gay Images? They whose wits are so su^ernaturally pointed
as that ^hey can see incomparably more 2 Cor. 3.
glory in the poor at^^re of Paul ministering the Gospel, then in the Royal
Robes of Aaron ministering ^he Gospel: They that can see beauty in the very feet
of those that bring glad Tidings; though the feet especially of Messengers have
no more beauty ^n the judgment of the outward Eye then the dust under our
feet: They that esteem Esaias 52 7.
Psalm. 96.
Holiness for Beauty 13^.
Righteousness for Clothing* 1 Timothy 2.10.
good Works for Decking, and the Esaias 49.18.
gathering of the Nations unto the Gospel, as the principal ornament of GODS
Church; Is it like that such will affect the places where such kind of Beauty,
Clothing, Decking, Ornaments and Tidings are freely offered, any whit the more
for the gawdinesse of Images? But, admit it were a suppose not intolerable that
some of Gods true little-ones should so little consider the nature and intent
of those kind of places as to affect them any ^hit the more for such kind ^f
Gazements sake; yet were ^ wisdom in Governors to ^ndescend thereunto? yea,
^^ere natural Governors ^ve also in that respect bin ^iser then so; witness
those ^ Lacedaemonians which would ^t suffer any kind of Ima^es to stand in
their Senate-^ouse, only for fear lest they should grow remiss in their ^ will
consultations by the ^ceans; witness also those ^uropians, which not only
^^^mitted no Images to stand ^ their Temples, but also ^ould scarce endure the
com^on light to shine into them: ^hereof the deviser of that (...).
Commonwealth gives this honest reason (the goodness of his wit making him
forget the quality of his Religion) Europ, ^^.^.
quia parciore and veluti dubia luce intendi animos and riligionem putab^nt. i.
e. Because they thought that the more obscure and sparing the outward Light
should be, the more inten^ would their ^^ndes and Religion be. Sh^llow
therefore and preposterous is that policie^ (admit it were never so lawful)
which thinks it good to glaze and play ster our Churches with such kind of Eye
delights toward the better winning and alluring our little-ones thereunto; It
being ^^deed no better then as if a ^rse, when she has taken child, to weane,
should wish ^e mother of the child to ^^me and keep with the ^^ild whereby she
might the ^etter still the Child: For ^ough by that means she ^ay hap to
still the child, ^t she may be sure by that ^eanes never to weane the ^hild.
An I so likewise when God has appointed Nurses ^ Kings shall be thy nursing
Fa^^ers, etc.) toward the wea^ing of his Children from ^ensual and transitory
(not ^nly from wicked) delights; ^ those nurses shall fraught ^is nurseries
(his Temples) Esaias 49.
with such kind of delights as sensual and childish minds are best pleased
withal: They shall by that means frustrate^ the intent of those places, and
make them become nurseries of those fancies, which their peculiar office is to
weane them from. Yea such kind of policy, how much is it better then as if the
husbandman should sow his field with all manner of weeds (as Red-weede
Bowd-weed, Carleekes, Cockle, Darnell, etc.) only because the Red, and Blew,
and Gay colored blooms of those weeds were far more pleasing sights in the
eyes of his little children, then the common grasse-co^ored Corn use to be:
But ^^e husbandman is wiser ^en so; and does not mean ^o poison his field and
starve ^is family toward the plea^ing of his foolish children; ^ut rather when
he sees his ^^eld so overgrown with such ^^mentable gaudinesse, does ^esolve
upon some other plot ^o bestow his seed and tillage upon: And so the great ^
Husbandman, the Lord of all things, when he shall find ^is Temples in like
manner ^wer grown with (far worse ^eedes then the weeds of the ^ield) the
entertainments of ^ensuality, and provocations ^f jelousie; Is it not to be
Ioh. 15.
feared that he will withdraw his presence from such Kin^ of places? Yea the
very wilderness is like to prove hi^ chief repose in such case^ for thither
he has promise^ to Hosea, 2.14.
allure his people and ther^ to speak kindly unto them* And there if he may
find either one true Jacob, which could say of his casual sleeping place, Genesis
28.17.
This is none other but the house of God; or one fervent Elias, which in a Cav^
remained jealous for the Lord of Hoasts; or one honest Hilarious which could
say, Contra An^r^t. quid in parietes insanitis, etc.
Male ecclesiam Dei in tectis aedificitsque veneramini, etc* ^ive me Dungeons,
give me ^ults, Caves, and Deserts, ra^^er then such kind of Temples: ^ven
with such will he ra^^er settle himself and show ^^em all his glory, then
with ^ultitudes of Fools which and glaring upon walls, and ^^ok the clean
contrary way ^ his approach.

6 Our next and last argu^ent against the allegation, ^^all be this; The life,
and ^orme, and property of a ^emple does consist in nothing so much as this;
that ^ be a place exempted and (...) part from common uses and common delights:
But ^he ornature which Images ^e afford, serves only for a kind of common
delight, and such as the ignorant, idle, an^ superstitious, the carnal,
sensual, and idolatrous are affected and pleased withal, a^ well as the best
(not to say incomparably more:) Therefore the ornature which Images do afford
does rathe^ profane and vilify, evacuate confound, and nullify a Temple, then
any way adorn it, o^ become any true beautific^tion unto it.

Touching the ground o^ this our argument, namely that the exempting and
se^ting a place a part from common uses and common delights does most properly
giv^ life and form, and constitution unto a Temple, it must ^sse for sound and
good, un^^ some other qualification ^ condition (Rite, respect, or ^eremony) be
found, where^ the life and form and quid^^tie of a Temple shall more ^culiarly
consist. It is true ^^deed the respects and rights which consist in Dedication,
^onsecration, Sanctification, (...) are attributed unto Tem^^es; as also the
Ministry of ^^e Word and Sacraments, ^e exercises of holiness ^^d enjoyment
of GODS ^^esence are found in Tem^^es; and finally goodlinesse ^^d magnificence
are conspi^ous in the fabric and stru^^ure of Temples: But if all these
conditions, qualifications, and respects may be found attributed and imparted
unto other things and places as well as Temples then must they not be esteemed
of sufficient force t^ give life and form, and specification unto a Temple.
For first concerning Dedicatio^ we find how every Deuteronomy. 20.5.
new bui^^ house in the time of Moses la^^ was also allowed it; And ^ the time
of Nehemiah, when the City was repaired, the very Nehem. 12.27.
walls thereof are sai^ to be dedicated with singings an^ thanksgivings upon
the tops of the walls even to the prison-gate an^ dung-gate, etc. Secondly,
concerning Consecration (if that ^espect does differ any thing from Dedication)
neither is that also a Ceremony pecu^^ar unto Temples; For even ^easts also and
fields, and ^ossessions, and the persons of ^en are in the Scripture said ^ be
consecrated, and the ^ing at any time so consecra^d is termed no less then
^actum Sanctorum deo, (in Ie^^es translation). Likewise ^oncerning
Sanctification, so ^^re is that respect also from ^^ing peculiar unto a Tem^le
(though that of the three ^ay be thought the princi^all) as that our ordinary
^eat is afforded it; for (...). 4.5.
It (says the Scripture) is sanctified by the Word and Prayer. Moreover (and
fourthly) as neither Dedication, Consecration, nor Sanctification, so also
neither is the Ministry of the Word and Sacraments of sufficient force to give
peculiaritie and specification unto a Temple: For we also find in the
Scripture, how we are allowed (yea, appointed) Deuteronomy. 6.7.
to talk of his word, even when we walk by the way, and in on^ dwelling
houses, and when we ly^ down, and when we rise up: Also the Sacraments in the
time of that Law were ordinarily administered in private houses; And our Savior
not only ^^d partake the Passover, but (...) ordained his last Supper ^n ^uk.
14.15.
ordinary dyning Cham^^^ The Eliz. 23.1.
Law of England ^o at this day allows us the ^e of Prayers and Psalms in (...)
private houses, and in ^^^aln cases (in case of di^^^nce) gives them the
privi^^ge of Temples: Again, ^ther are the exercises of ^^inesse, nor the
enjoyment ^ Gods presence, peculiar ^ to Temples; For in all ^^ces his presence
may be ^^joyed, Psalm. 1 39.
even though we (...) down to hell we shall find (...) there, or if we
remain in the ^^id Sea, we shall find him there: ^ if we be clapped up in the
dungeon we hope to find hi^ there. So likewise innocenc^ and holiness are
not peculia^ unto Temples, nor is the excluding wickedness and unholinesse the
proper office o^ a Temple; Every place ^ the World being bound ^ do as much,
and no place ^ the World being allowed ^ commit ungodlynesse in. F^nally
concerning outwa^^ sumptuousness and magni^^cence of building so far is the
also from giving propriet^ and distinction unto Templ^ as that not only the
palac^ of pride and vanity, but al^^ the Houses and temples o^ Idolatry, have
also excelled and gloried therein ^itnesse that ^^n hist. n. 36.14.
Temple of ^ jesus, which cost all Asia ^^o hundred years to build ^; and
which had above six ^ore pillars, whereof every ^e had a several King to
^aintain it: witness also that ^emple Herod. l. 1.
of Belus, which is ^^ported to be duorum stadio^^ amplitudine, and that it ^ed
a Tower in the midst ^f it, crassitudine simul and alti^dine stadii; and so
Tower ^^on Tower, usque adoctavam: ^itnesse also that Temple of ^^zicus (a
City swallowed up ^ith an Earthquake) the Pil^^rs whereof were Dio (...). lib.
70.
Singulae (...) singulis lapidibus, and yet quinquaginta cubitorum alitudine,
and quatuor ulnarum crassitudine: witness also that Temple which, belike, was
sometime in our Britain; which had it not excelled for outward structure and
magnificence, the people would never have adored it as a god as Sen. de morte
Claud.
Seneca reports: yea so far is such outward sumptuousness from giving
peculiarity unto a Temple, as that one of the ancient Fathers forbears not to
say that Hilarious contra Au^ent.
such kind of sumptuous Temples are most likely to prove the seats of
Antichrist. And wherein then is the property, form, and quiddity of a Temple
so likely to consist, as in this respect and condition which we plead for;
namely, in being a place exempted and set apart from common uses and delights
(not only from wickedness?) which property as it was never found in any
places but in Temples, so also where it alone is found there is nothing
esteemed to be wanting unto the nature and substance of a Temple: And so much
the Patriarch Jacob may be sufficient to teach us, when he called a plain
Genesis 28.22.
Stone the house of God, though it had nothing belonging to such a house, but
only his setting it apart from common uses, and confining it to be a mention
and remembrance of his God; the Church of England also at this day,
acknowledging as much in effect when it esteems all those places for Temples,
which time out of mind have been exempted and set apart from common uses,
though whether ever they had any Dedications or Consecrations, or other then
such as were superstitious and idolatrous it be unknown. For as the nature of
a Sabbath does not consist in this, that it affords holy exercises, for so also
other days must do; or in this that it debarreth wicked actions, for so also
other days must do; or in this, that it affords much vacant time, for so
also other days may do; but only in this, that it debars all manner of work:
So may we well conceive that the nature of a Temple does consist, not in this,
that it is a place dedicated, consecrated, etc. for so also other places and
things are apt to be; nor in this, that it affords Gods word or Gods presence,
for so also other places may do; nor in this that it excludes ungodliness and
wickedness, for so also every place is bound to do; but only in this that it
is exempted from common business and common delights: As also our Savior did
sufficiently declare, clare, when he forbad the carrying of Mark. 11.16.
vessels through the Temple, and Paul, when he permitted not so much as 1
Cor. 11.
eating and drinking in such kind of places; such kind of actions being
notwithstanding both lawful and necessary, and having no exception against
them but this, that Gods houses might be supposed liable and applyable unto
common uses and businesses by such means. For as those kinds of actions and
business which do well become the week days are said in the Scripture to
Exodus 31.14.
defile and pro^hane the sabbath day: So ^^y those kind of actions and ^elights
be found to pro^hane and nullify a Temple, which other places can take ^o
exception against. Upon which conclusion and ground (...) fairly follows, that
the ^^tting up of Images or any thing else in Churches, only ^o please the
outward Eye, and to afford a common kind ^f delight (the ornature which Images
afford when it ^s at the best being no better) ^s rather a profanation,
pollution, and prostitution unto those kind of places then any perfection or
beautification.

But very like it will be pleaded against us, that by this rule all outward
Beautification whatsoever within the compass of a Templ^ (though it be not by
Images shall be excepted against; yea the beauty of King Solomon^ Temple shall
be found un^^ warrantable by this rule; for no doubt all sorts of people as
well the heathens, ungodly, and sensual, as the holy and spiritually minded
were affected therewith: whereunto, Christian Reader, we are desirous to
answer a few words: And first concerning such outward beautification in
general; we may shortly answer, that when the intent of it is, only to cover
unsightlines and outward Eye-sores, (...) is to be esteemed as a ^ranch of
necessity, and a ^reventing of scandal, rather ^hen an ornament intended to
^elight and please the out^ard Eye: Even as the 1 Cor. 12 23.
co^ering of our uncomely parts ^ith the more comeliness is not ^o please the
beholders, or to ^ake our uncomely parts ex^ell those parts which are ^ore
noble, but only to keep ^he more noble parts from disdaining the society of
those inferior and less comely parts, and least otherwise there might spring
up Verse 25.
a Schism in the Body. And as we admit beautiful and rich-attired persons
into our Temples, not because they are so adorned and so beautiful (for their
beauties do rather offend then edify in those kind of places) but only
because either their beauties must be admitted, or their persons withal
excluded: So our admitting of such kind of outward Beautifications into our
Churches, may well be, not for the delighting and pleasing of outward eyes, but
only because unless they be admitted, offensive and scandalous unsightlines
must remain uncovered. Now in the second place concerning that special
beautification of King Solomon's Temple, we ^nswer, First, that not only ^he
Analogy of Religion, ^ut also the body of the Fathers, do agree with our ^
Homily in this, that the ^umptuousnes of those times was only a figure to
signify, and not an example to follow: Even as the Bloomes of the spring,
which though they may well signify what kind of Fruit may be expected, yet
are they no examples for the rest of the Seasons to follow. Secondly, the
indulgence of God might think good to entertain that minority of his people
with some plausible shadow of a Temple Tom. 2. Hom. 2. p. 3.
until the true Temple, ( Revel. 21.22.
The Almighty God and the Lamb) should be revealed. Thirdly, the waywardness
of that Minority which (as our Part prima.
Homily says) was allured with nothing so much as with goodly gay things might
somewhat be of force with the Lord to yield a little more unto the^ then was
originally intended: Even as their like untractablenes extorted the Bil of
Divorcement from him, which from the Mat. 19.8.
beginning (our Savior says) was not so: or as it moved him to yield unto
their burnt Offerings and Sacrifices which ^ay well be thought to have ^d no
better beginning; the lord thus speaking of them ^ the Prophet Jeremy, (...).
7.22.
I spoke (...) unto your Fathers concerning ^^nt offerings and sacrifices,
(...) only I commanded them, say^^g, obey my voice: And the ^rophet Esaias
plainly saying, Esaias 1.12.
^ho has required these things ^ your hands? Fourthly, it was ^^ly one such
Sumptuous ^emple and that also (as the ^cripture says) built 1 King. 6.38.
in seven ^^res, which was allowed ^^to that whole Nation, even (...) that time
of minority: their Synagogues and O^^ories being no more sumptuous to the
outwar^ Eye (as far as can appear o^ of any Writer for diverse hundred years
after that La^ began) then their dwelli^^ houses, and for along ti^ were no
other places. Fifth when David first motion^ the building of that Templ^ the
Lord not only thus a^swered him, Thou shall (...) build me an house, but al^
further expostulates with hi^ in these very words; 1 Chronicles. 17.6.
Whe^soever I walked with all Isa^ spoke I a word unto any of a Judges (whom I
commanded feed my people) saying, why but you me not an house, etc? It (...)
indeed, He afterward ^e them directions about (...) building of it; But what ^
that? For so also he gave ^m directions how they ^^uld be ordered under a
(...), and yet the Scripture ^^h, that He ^^ea 13.11.
gave them a (...) in anger: From whence ^o (sixthly) we may argue, (...) as
the Lord did take ^^eir desiring of a King to be ^ind of 1 Samuel 8 7.
rejecting him from (...) their King, and so gave (...) a King in anger; So it
^y be interpreted, that he ^ewise did take their desi^g of a Temple to proceed
(...) a kind of unwillingnes to have him for their Temple, and so did give them
^ Temple in some degree o^ displeasure. Again, we fin^ in Scripture how he
often checks them by their Ier 7.4
Temple, and by their Ezech. 24.21.
dotage upon the beauty of it; Ringing ^ also as often in their ear* how that
Esaias 66
heaven was his se^ and earth his foot stool* what how will ye build me?
Which te^ as soon as Saint Steven in h^ Apology did but once mention, he
presently brake for into that indignation, Acts 7 51.
Y^ stif-necked and of uncircumcis^ hearts and ears, ye have alwa^ ^^sted the
Spirit of God, etc. ^oreover, and in the eighth ^ace, had the Lord made any ^ch
special reckning of that ^emple of Solomon would he we suffered it to be so
razed (...) destroyed, and that for ^^ers hundred years before ^^t Law
expired? For we ^de in the Scripture when (...) Ark of God was taken (...)
the enemies, though it was ^ thing most easy to be Sam. 6.7.
car^^ about and rifled, yet did (...) providence of God so ^iraculously
preserve it, as that they that took it durst ^ot so much as touch it, but ^ith
all the honor and cost they could devise did send back again. And therefo^^
had the Lord so delighted that beautiful Temple would he have suffered it to
be ^ destroyed, and that when ^ without any such miraculou^ assistance (as the
Ark needed it might have bin preserved* It being also ordinary wit^ the very
heathens to preserv^ Temples, even when the^ preserved nothing else; an^ much
more, no doubt, would they have preserved tha^ Temple which in those day was
the mirror of the world and was then in their own possession, had not some
degree of Gods indignation a^^ost it made way to their ^^d rage, toward their
ma^g no difference betwixt and the City, but with the ^^fused stroke of fire
and lord to destroy them both ^^gether. Moreover, had the ^^rd been so
delighted with (...) beauty of that Temple, ^w is it that the second ^emple,
which was built by ^ods own appointment, and which was so often promi^ ^and
called for, did not^ithstanding come so far ^ort of it? the Scripture ^^inly
saying of it, that (...). 2.3.
it (...) as nothing in comparison of it: which president alo^ may be
sufficient to perswa^ us, that the beauty of the (...) Temple was rather
offensi^ then otherwise, even in t^^ time of that nonage; the people by means
thereof bei^^ brought to linger after, and ^ dote upon outward things and to
catch at the shadow i^ stead of the substance, the shell in-stead of the kernel
and the Templum Domini, i^ stead of Templum Dominum, a^ experience did prove.
We^ conclude therefore, that the beauty of Solomon's Temple is no sufficient
exception against the ground of our argument, which was this, that all outward
Beautification in Tem^^^s, which is intended only ^ please the outward eye, is
^egree of converting Tem^^es unto common uses, which ^e peculiar office and
nature (...) a Temple excludes; the ex^ellencie of Temples being ^ore or less,
as they are ^ore or less exempted from ^ommon uses, whereby (if it ^ere
possible) nothing but God himself in those kind ^f places might be thought
upon: The Lord only indeed being the life and spirit of all Temples; yea, and
not only so but also being (he has expressly said ^t) the very Revel. 21 22.
Temple it self; there being no other Temple that ca^ contain the Catholic
Spou^ of Christ but only he. An^ that only Temple must ever^ member of Christ
long afte^ and delight in; live and dwel^ in day and night: And tha^ they shall
never do as long as they are so wedded unto visible Temples, and the beauty
thereof.

It is true indeed, this temporal life does need (at least can make use of)
material and visible Temples, we grant: But considering how prone the nature
of man is to relapsing, and to lownd after the beauty of old Jerusalem, when
we should be ready to enter into ^^e gates of the new, and with ^ose Israelites
to seek Amos 5.5.
Gil^, and Beersheba, rather then ^e Lord; and with those car^all Jews (as
August. de Civit. Dei 18.45.
Austin terms them therein) to interpret the ^eauty of the second Temple
^rophesied of by Haggie) to ^onsist in some glorious re^auration of a visible
Tem^le: It therefore concerns the people of God when they in^end to build any
material Temples, to set them forth with such gravity and simpli^itie as may
give the Comers unto them to under^tand, that the beauty of a Temple is not
like the beauty of other places, nor to be judged of with that kind of eye
where with we judge of other buildings* At least they must not be so indulg^nt
unto weak and (supposed) little-ones as to set forth their Temples with the
common, gross, and scandalous (not to say Idolatrous) beauty of Images, which
the Allegation pleads for, and against which only we have hitherto (and that
we hope sufficiently) excepted.

2 The other Allegation in the behalf of these Church-Images which we have
specified in the beginning is this; that they furnish the dead with Tombs and
Monuments: whereunto we answer, That the things which are especially scandalous
must not be suffered in Churches, but only in case necessity, as we have
already declared. Now that such kind of Monuments are scandalous sights in
Churches, it cannot be denied: It being easy to observe through the course of
the times that the ordinary original of Idols has been from Sepulchers, and
such kind of Monuments. And the Scripture gives us a fair warrant so to think
when the Lord says, that, He will Levit. 26 30.
cast their carcasses upon the carcasses of their Idols; for other carcasses
then such dead bodies as were interred under their Idols, their Idols could not
have: And it was the usual course amongst the Ancient Heathens first to erect
Altars over their dead, and then to build Temples over those Altars, and then
finally, to make their dead the gods of those Temples. Moreover, the reason why
the Lord would not have the Deuteronomy. 34.6.
Burying place of Moses to be known, is agreed upon by all Divines to be for
the preventing of Idolatry. And therefore if the mere Burying place ^f a Saint,
and that in the ^ildernesse, be so apt to be^et an Idol, how much more ^ill it
be fitted for such a pur^ose when it shall be in a ^emple, and withal shall
^ave the Image of the Saint ^rected upon it, and that so ^loriously and
sumptuously ^s that if men had a desire to ^ake a god of it, they could ^ot do
more. Thirdly, there ^eing a special pronenesse in ^he hearts of men to
magnify their Forefathers ( Aug.
mortuos ^aitatur vanitas vulgi magis ^^am vivos) and to esteem most highly of
those which lived in the former times; partly out of an envy against the
present times ( Flacc.
Virtutem incolmem ^ dimus, sublatam ex oculis quaer^mus Invidi) and partly
because the imperfections of the present times are more in sight how can it be
otherwise like but that the Images of those so admired Ancients, will draw
admiration and forbidden respects? Especially after on^e the moss of Antiquity
is grown upon them; Antiquity (as a Hieron. in Prol. super Job.
Father says) being of force to make even errors acceptable; and whereinto
(as Lact. 2.7.
another says) men think it a point of impiety to ^nquire: And can we then
^ake question but that such ^inde of Monuments must ^eeds be most scandalous
^ights in Churches? Now in ^he second place, that there is (...) necessity of
such kind of Monuments in those kind of ^laces (Necessity only being of force
to dispense with scandals) It will easily be granted. F^r first, the only
^ntent and use of those Monuments is to do an honor unto the dead; whereas
Honor, though it be never so sound and good, is not a matter of necessity;
the Scripture telling us that the multitude of those which shall be admitted
into the state o^ bliss shall be such, as Revel. 7.9.
no man can number; And therefore i^ not so much as their persons can be
known, much less can their Names and Fames be so great upon earth as to have
distinct Monuments erected upon them. Secondly, such kind of Monuments may be
erected in other places as well as Temples, and that more obviously and
conspicuously; Sepulchers and Graves (we are sure) having been extant before
any Temples were known. Thirdly, there are other courses more apt to continue
the remembrance of the ^^ad, then those kind of Mo^^ments; namely, Inscripti^^s
and Epitaphs: For by such and of expresssions, the truest, ^^d noblest, and
most inward ^^ts of dead are apt to be (...) more lively and properly forth;
the tools of Car^s and Pensils of Painters ^ing able to describe only ^^eir
outsides, and so much of ^^em as Fools and unworthy ^^rsons (yea, Stones or
lumps ^ clay) may excel or resem^^e them in: whereas the pens ^ the Muses are
able to flou^^^h out their most hidden ex^^^lencies, and imprint their ^^^tues
with such durable ^haracters as shall make them able a thausand years after to
say, as the Poet did truly divine of himself when he said, Horace Carm. 3.30.
Exegi monumentum ^re perennius,
Regalique situ Pyramidum altius.


And as another of this kind could say: Valor. Mart. 7.84.
Certior in nostro carmin^ vultus er^t:
Casibus his nullis, nullis delebilis annis
Vivet: Apelleum cummorie^ur opus.


Fourthly, mere natural men have made no reckoning of these kind of
Monuments; witness that Plutarch de Agiselao.
Grecian Prince, which would not suffer so much as his Picture (in his life
time) to be taken; an^ that for this worthy reason, because he would be known
by nothing but his acts: witness also he that gave his Emperor this counsel
( Maecenas to Augustus) Dio Cass. Lib.
never to suffer any Images or Temples to be erected unto him; because (says
he) If you rule well, the whole world will be your Temple, and every City a
Monument and Basis of your glory; But especially specially witness that whole
Commonwealth of those ancient Arrian. lib. 8.
Indies, which would never suffer any Sepulchers to be erected over their dead,
because they thought no man worthy to be remembered any longer, then during the
remembrance of his virtues: which so sound and impartial judgment of theirs,
the providence of God (who loves always to requite sound judgment wheresoever
he find it) did requite with another virtue like unto it; For so the same
Author does further report of that Nation, that they were never known to tell
a lie; His nefas est (says ^e) falsi quicquam pro vero dice^^; neque Indorum
quisquam ^^quam, in Iudicum, qoud men^tus esset, vocatus est: That so, ^^ch as
scorned those kind of ^^ayses which could not be and but by falsifications and
^ounterfeit Images, might be ^equited with such a special ^ellowship of the
Truth (Never to be taken with a lie) as ^ever any Nation before them, or after
them, attained unto. And shall then the Christians (so incomparably ^raced of
God above those ^^mes) be so liquorous or desi^^ous of those kind of com^on,
painted, pybald, and scan^^lous Monuments which Heathens and mere natural
Nations have thought so unworthy of? Especially when as the Lord has promised
them another manner of remembrance; for thus says the Prophet Malachie, Mal.
^.16.
A book of remembrance was written before him, for the^ that feared the Lord,
and that thought upon his name. Finally it is the great decree^ of God that the
bodies of his servants (though they be never so holy and worthy) should be
sown in corruption, though they shall rise in incorruption* etc. sown in
dishonor, though they shall rise in honor: And therefor to set forth those
Bodies (...) such pompous and glori^us manner while they are under the doom of
corrup^^on and dissolution in the ^rave, is little less then a ^inde of
resistance unto mor^ality, and reluctation against that great decree, as also a
^inde of falsification unto the ^ state of the dead, besides that provocation
unto the di^^ine jelousie and stumbling unto posterity which general
experience has found to in^sue thereupon. And so, without further ado, and
left we go beyond the scantling of an Appendix we will here make an end.

Only Christian Reader before I dismiss you, I have a little request to make
unto you, and it shall be this; that whereas I lately in a little book did
show the insufficiency of diverse reasons which use to be made in the behalf
of Images, and in the end thereof did intimate that there were yet other
allegations of that kind which deserved likewise to be excepted against: my
request is, that if I once again and the third time shall publish something to
that purpose, you be not unwilling to make some gentle construction of my so
often coming about so common a point. For it was not at ^he first (nor yet is
it) my in^ent to handle the point ac^ording to all the dimensi^ns of a common
place, but ^nly to answer objections: and objections having no mu^uall
dependence one upon another, but being apt to pro^ed from diverse and distant,
and even contrary quarters, though we should make as ^any several commings,
and ^eturns, and books as we meet ^ith several objections, it might be without
any inter^^ption unto our matter, and ^ll one to the Reader, and in ^ome
respect also the better ^or both Writer and Reader. For the less is written at
onc^ the more easily it is read, an^ the more thoroughly perused* whereas if much
be written at once, the Readers leisur^ (perhaps also a Deske and a Chair)
must be expected* But for my part I plainly profess it, that it is no such
politic consideration which moves me to write so little at once, but plain
and right down necessity; my reach and reading not serving me to write much,
and my fidelity to the Truth not suffering me to hold my peace. And though
like enough I may hap to go in but the brand of a bawling Curr by the means,
(...) the barking shawlt which ^ble to discover a thief, and ^ not able to
worrie a ^epe, may be as fit for the ^^^pherds purpose as the best; ^ so the
little fingers are ^ full unto the Body, as well ^he greater Limbs; and our
^iles manus, may (with that ^^norian Cripple) depile the ^mish train by a
hair at ^^e, when the strongest arm one, single tugge shall never ^ it.
Finally, it is the Com^andement of God, that eve^^ soul should serve him with
his might; And therefore ^^ey that have but little abili^^^s, must not bury
them, or ^ ashamed to pr^sent them to the view and judgment o^ the Master
Builders: wh^ though perhaps they sometime find them not useful for their
purposes, yet may they think good to pronounce tha^ blessing upon the authors*
Thou have bin faithful in little* Also the Lord himself shall be somewhat the
more honored by the means; the abundance of his gifts and graces the better
appearing, when some of them be judged to be redundant, and to spare. And so
Christian Reader, for the present I take my leave, and until our next meeting
I commend you to the Grace of God.

FINIS.
