BY THE RIGHT HONORABLE The Commissioners for management of the several
forfeited Estates, Goods and Chattels of the Rebels of IRELAND.
WHEREAS we are informed that several persons do scruple, and doubt, whether
we, by virtue of a Commission Granted to us, by their Majesty's, bearing date
the twelfth day of July, in the second year of their Majesty's Reign, do intend
to seize, and sequester, into our hands, for their Majesty's use, the personal
Goods and Chattels of persons lately in Rebellion, or aiding and assisting to
the Irish Rebels, though they, or any of them should come in, and live quitely,
and that within the time limited in His Majesty's Gracious Declaration, given
at the Camp near Finglass, the seventh day of July, 1690. Now, for the
prevention of any such mistake, and though, in the very preamble of our Order,
of the 16th day of this instant July, we have expressed these words (the Goods
and Chattels of those fled through guilt, from their places of abode). We do
hereby declare, our Commission has a reference to the aforesaid Declaration;
and we do declare, the Goods and Chattels personal, of all those comprised
within the said Declaration, are not intended to be seized, or sequestered by
us, or our Orders. Dated at the Council Chamger, Dublin, 19th day of July, 1690.

Longford, Anth. Mead, R.Fitz-Gerrald, Hen. Fane, Robert Gorges, Joseph
Coghlan, Edward Corker, Henry Davys.
