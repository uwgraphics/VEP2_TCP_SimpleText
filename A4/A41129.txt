TO THE CHRISTIAN READER.
CHRISTIAN READER:
THou have here Publishe for thy benefit a Treatise of a necessary and
profitable Subject; wherein thou shall find Magnum in parvo, a great deal of
matter in a little Treatise: and that not trash, nor altogether vulgar, but
precious Truths, and many choice notions. A Treatise that it may be this queazy
Age will hardly relish, Mannah is lothed by wanton appetites, Scriptures are
looked over now by some as rude Elements, how much more, those Books that lay
down Elements of Religion out of them; but know thou, that they have the worst
stomachs, that must be fed, with fancies and made dishes; and they are the
healthiest, that ^^^d on ordinary solid food. And their souls are but diseased
pieces that relish little but n^w ^rankes; the soundest and strongest souls
are such as love and feed on ordinary wholesome Truths. Ordinary truths, are
like ordinary mercies, and usually find the (...) entertainment; Ordinary
mercies are both necessary and most useful, we owe our lives to them under God
from day to day; yet because ordinary they are little regarded, especially by
the vulgar: but an intelligent man ^^^zes them, and is affectionatly thankful
to God for them. ^o ordinary truths are most necessary and useful, they
concur to the being of a CHRISTIAN, when others only add luster to him; yet
are they despised by many, because co^on; but a wise man knows their use, and
will relish them, and be chiefly thankful for them. And so will thou have
cause for this Book, if thou use it conscientiously, if thou be a read
CHRISTIAN, it may be as an Epitome of Divinity to help memory, if thou be
raw, here have thou a a Compendium of necessary saving Truths. If thou have
charge of a Family, it may be very useful to help thee in thy duty of
Catechizing; yet one thing I must warn thee of, It is a Post-humous, the
father (A man, precious man in his generation) is dead, and fatherless
children thou know are obnoxious to ill usage, but thou in thy pity, must
supply its defect; where the Printer has been short in representing this
Treatise as it was drawn by the Father of it, in a Character not so plain and
legible. If thou will where such need appears, help it with thy Pen, and me
with thy prayers, I shall remain

OF CATECHIZING.
Question 1.WHat is Catechism?
Answ. It is the teaching of the Principles of the Doctrine of CHRIST, namely
of Repentance from dead works and of Faith, Heb. 6. 1. To them that have need
of milk and not of strong meat, Heb. 5. 12. as being babes in Christ, 1 Cor.
3. 1. and the lambs of Christ, whom the Minister must feed as well as his
Sheep, Joh. 21. 15.

Quest. 2. Who must Catechize besides the Minister?
Answ. My Parents must Catechize me and teach me the truth of the Lord, Isa.
38. 19. My Father must teach me the information of the Lord, Ephesians. 6. 4. And
my mother too must, Prove. 1. 8. So did Salomon's mother teach him, Prove. 31. 1.
Yea, and the master of the house where I dwell, though he be not my father, yet
he must teach me if I be but one of his household, Genesis 18. 19.

Qu. 3. How if Parents do not teach their Children?
Answ. They are cruel Ostriches and their hearts are hardened, Job 39. 16. And
God has taken the Spirit of wisdom from them, verse. 17. They loose their own
souls, and do what in them lies to cast away our souls too; as ever they
mean to keep their own souls they must teach us, Deuteronomy. 4. 7.

Qu. 4. Why have thou a Name given thee in Baptism?
Ans. Because the people of God named their children then, so did Abraham name
his Son Isaac at Circumcision, Genesis 21. 3. The parents have power to appoint
the name what it shall be, Luke 1. 60, 63. Which ought not to be one of a bad
signification, for that is a shame, as the name of Nabal signifies a fool, 1 Samuel 25. 25.

Qu. 5. What use do thou make of thy name given thee in Baptism?
Ans. Two uses: First, to teach me Christianisme that I must give up my name
unto God to be his servant, Jude a servant of Christ, Jude 1. James a servant
of God, Iam. 1. 1. Moses Gods servant, Josh. 1. 2. Secondly, that J keep my
name unspotted and undefiled; for God only accounts upon such Names, Revel. 3.
4. And therefore it it is fit I should not change it, unless upon a great
occasion, as Abram afterward was called Abraham, Genesis 17. 5. Nor give any
cause why any nickname should be set upon it, as Esau to be called Edom, Gen
25. 30. The Pope that changes his Christian name, shows himself to be
Antichrist, 1 Ioh. 2. 22.

Qu. 6. Why would God have thee Baptized?
Ans. For four reasons: First, to teach me that I was borne by nature the
Child of wrath and damnation, Ephesians. 2. 3. Secondly, to give me the washing of
regeneration or renewing of the Holy Ghost, 1 Tit. 3. 5. Thirdly, to Covenant
with me, that I should walk in newness of life, Romans 6. 4. Fourthly, to
distinguish me not outwardly from such as are not Gods people, but Iufidels and
Pagans; for it is a badge and sign of my profession Genesis 17. 11. And not to be
omitted by any means, verse. 14. Nor contemned nor neglected in the least
degree, seeing it is a matter of Salvation or damnation, Mark. 16. 16.

Q. 7. What is required in him that is Baptized?
Answ. He must have Faith, the Eunuch had faith actually before he was
baptized, Act. 8. 37. Or at least to be in the sanctifying Covenant of faith,
and so even a Child is clean, 1 Cor. 7. 14.

Q. 8. How then can babes be Baptized?
Ans. Children ought to be Baptized, for all the Iaylors house was baptized,
Act. 16. 33. Even all Stephanus household, 1 Cor. 1. 16. Whereof it is likely
Children were part; for children were Circumcised, Luke 1. 59. Now Baptism is
the circumcision of Christ, Colos. 2. 11, 12. And when Peter urged Baptism
upon his hearers, he pressed it with this argument; because the Promise was
made to you and to your children, Act. 2. 39. The Covenant to Abraham and his
Seed stands everlastingly, Genesis 17. 7. In substance to them which are the
children of faithful Abraham Romans 4. 16.

Q. 9. Can Babes have Faith then?
A. First, they may have the seal of Faith, Romans 4. 11. Secondly they may have
the Spirit of God, Luke 1. 15. Which is a Spirit of faith, 4. 13. Thirdly, they
may have faith so accounted, for they may be said to believe, Math. 18. 6. 4ly,
They may have seminall Faith, for they may be borne again, and then the seed
of God abides in them, 1 John 3. 9. As children have a reasonable soul,
though yet they have not actual reason to know the right hand from the left.
Jonah 4 11. And therefore they do not actually believe, because knowing and
believing go together, 1 Ioh. 4. 16.

Q. 10. Have all elect Babes then this Spirit of Faith, and this same seminall
Faith, in their Baptism?
A. Some have, as first Jeremiah was sanctified in the womb, Ier. 1. 5. John
leapt in his mothers womb for joy in Christ Luke 1 44. Secondly, such as show
strange instincts and aptnes in Religion and godliness as soon as they can
speak plain, almost as Timothy, who savingly knew the Scriptures from a
child, 2 Timothy 3. 15. but all have not, for some live in sin till 20 years
after, as Paul was not converted till he was at the age of a man, Acts 9. 3.
Being sensual before, and therefore without the Spirit, Jude 19.
Nevertheless though he had not the Spirit dwelling in him from the womb, yet
he had the Spirit seperating and keeping him for a day of conversion, Gal. 1.
15. But his Circumcision, and his Baptism were not actually availeable to the
sealing of remission of sins, till he did call on the Name of the Lord by
Faith, Act. 22. 16.

Q. 11. What benefits have thou by Baptism?
A. 3. I am thereby sealed. First, to be a member of Christ's body the Church,
1 Cor. 12. 13. Secondly, to be one of the Sons of God, Joh. 1. 12, 17. For so
was Christ sealed Gods Son, Ioh. 6. 27. In his Baptism, Math. 3. 17. 3ly, to
be an inheritor of the Kingdom of God, Mark 16. 16. Standing benefits have no
need of reiteration of Baptism, for there is no often put to it, as their is
to the Lords Supper, 1 Cor. 11. 25. For it is a Sacrament of regeneration or
the new birth, Tit. 3. 5. A man cannot be born twice, John 3. 9, 10. A man
cannot be borne twice, for the ingrafied word of God does dwell for ever in
him, 1 Pet. 1. 25.

Q. 12. Have all that are Baptized these benefits?
A. No: for the Spirit blows where it lists, John 3. 8. and does not tie
himself to the water of Baptism, Math. 3. 11. Neither is this Baptism which
is outward in the flesh, Romans 2. 28. Esau was Circumcised, yet God hated him,
Romans 9. 13. Simon Magus Baptized, yet in the gall of bitterness, Act. 8. 13,
23.

Q. 13. Who be they that have not these benefits?
A. No man can know them, till by their fruits we may know them, Math. 7. 13.
Indeed Parents are bound to believe the best, and hope the best, for so Charity
does in all things that are not yet manifest, 1 Cor. 13. 7. But for all our
Charity, they cannot be vouchsafed forgiveness of sins, unless they join
amendment of life to their Baptism, Act. 2. 28. Nor saved, that answer not out
of an upright Conscience to Christ's interogatories, though they were washed, 1
Pet. 3. 21. And yet members in Christ's visible Church and vesses in his house.
2 Timothy 2. 20. And called Sons of God though rebellious, Isa. 1. 2. And may be
said to be begotten with an outward regeneration, Deuteronomy. 32. 18.

Q. 14. What did thou promise and vow in thy Baptism?
A. Three things. First, Repentance of my sins, for he that lives in sin is
of the Devil, 1 John 3. 8. Secondly, Faith, for he that believes not is
condemned already, John 3. 18. Thirdly, obedience to all Gods Commandments;
for cursed is he that obeys not, Ier. 11. 3. All these things was I taught
in my Baptism, to observe all my life after, Math. 28. 19 2^. Now all this
obedience must be done by the power of Faith in Christ, Col. 3. 17. And
therefore it is called the obedience of Faith. Romans 16. 26. And this Faith
works by love, Ga^. 5. 6. And love must set me on work to keep Christ's
Commandments, John 14. 15

Q. 15. Art thou bound to perform thy Baptism, Vow and Oath?
A. I am bound* Psa. 50. 14. Or else I shall be utterly cut off Nah. 1. 15. Yea
I am perjured else, in making such a Covenant* Hos 10. 4. And Christ will be a
swift witness against me, Mal. 3. 5. And if I now live in sin and do not
keep my Vow, it is better for me I had never taken this Vow upon me* Eccl.
5. 5.

Q. 16. What is Belief or Faith?
Ans. It is the gift of God, Ephesians. 2. 8. Whereby I believe the words of
Christ, Psalm. 119. 66. And find rest in my soul in him, Math. 11. 29. So that
now it is no more I that life and work, and do, but Christ that lives in me,
Gal. 2. 20.

Q. 17. How many ways is Faith taken?
Ans. Six: First, Historical Faith, Iam. 2. 19. 2. ly, A dead Faith, Iam. 2.
26. 3. ly, A temporary Faith, Luke 8. 13. 4. ly, A bare hoping Faith, Act. 8.
13. 5. ly, a miraculous Faith, 1 Cor. 13. 2. 6. ly, this same saving and
justifying Faith, Romans 5. 1. A Reprobate may have the first five and be damned,
for there is but one Faith, Ephesians. 4. 5. Which the world knows not, for it is
a mystery 1 Timothy 3. 9. And the most men say they have it if we will believe
them; yet if we will believe Christ few have it, and it is very scarce, Luke 1.
8. Being the faith of the Elect. Tit. 1. 1.

Q. 18. Do not wicked men say, they believe in Christ?
Ans. Yea, Ioh. 2. 23. but Christ will not believe them, nor commit himself
unto them, verse. 24. It is not a bare believing of Christ in the clouds, but
the having of Christ in a man, that gives a man life, 1 John 5. 12. It is
living in Christ as well as believing in Christ, Joh. 11. 26. The wicked may
say they have faith, Iam. 2. 18. But if Christ be not in them by his spirit, 1
John 3. 24. For all this faith they may be Reprobates, 2 Cor. 13. 5. Not every
one that swum after the Ark, and cried after Noah in the Ark, and clambred and
hung upon the arc, but only they that were in the arc were saved, 1 Pet. 3.
20. So only they that get into Christ are new creatures, 2 Cor. 5. 17.

Q. 19. Why so?
Ans. Faith if it be unfeigned, 2 Timothy 1. 5. Ingrafteth a man into Christ, Romans
11. 23. If a man be not ingrafted into Christ he shall burn in hell fire,
John 15. 6.

Q. 20. What reasons be there of this?
Ans. Two: First, the sentence of the Law cannot otherwise be true, the same
soul that sins, that soul shall dye, Ezec. 18. 4. Therefore all the Elect
must have such a faith, that they may be one with Christ and Christ with them,
Ioh. 14. 20. That Christ's death may be their death, 2 Cor. 5. 14. Secondly,
Christ is the life of them that believe, Col. 3. 4. As the life of a man is in
him, and the life of every creature is in it, Genesis 1. 30. So Christ in a
believer; this is a mystery, Gal. 1. 27. Which whosoever has not, the wrath of
God abides on him Ioh. 3. 36.

Q. 21. Do thou believe the Articles of faith?
Ans. Yea I believe in God the Father Almighty, maker of heaven, and so forth,
which being a form of sound words, I must hold fast in Faith and love, 1 Timothy
1. 13.

Q. 22. Why do thou say, I Believe?
Ans. Because J cannot be saved without a particular Faith of my own, Iam. 2.
18. The just shall live by his faith, Hab. 2. 4. Whereby I may say, Christ gave
himself for me, Gal. 2. 20. And that he is my Savior, Luke 1. 17. For faith
is my life, Ioh. 20. 31. As David could say, J live. Psalm. 116. 2. So he could
say I believe, verse. 10, Neither is this presumption in a Believer, for he
knows, it that Christ is his Redeemer in particular, Job 19. 25. Yea in the
time of Spiritual desertion, he can say, My God, my God. Psalm. 22. 1.

Q. 23. Is not this Presumption in some?
Ans. Yea, it is Presumption in many, for if a carnal professor shall say, my
God. Hos. 8. 2. The Lord pardons not his sins for all this, but is an enemy
unto him. verse. 3. As the body without the spirit is dead, so Faith without
works is dead also. Jam. 2. 26. Ignorant Faith is no Faith, but unbelief. 1 Timothy 1. 13. Faith asks who, and what, who is the Lord that I may believe. John
9. 36. For Faith is an explicit knowing Faith, through Faith we understand.
Heb. 11. 3. Knowledge is partly before Faith. 1 John 4. 16. And partly after
Faith. 2 Pet. 1. 5. A man must know what he believes, or else he cannot
believe. John 10. 38. Yet Faith is not so explicit, but there is some
implicinesse in it, as long as we live here. 1 John 3. 2.

Q. 24. How can thou say I believe, can a man know that he believes?
A. A man may know that he believes, 2 Timothy 1. 12. Even by that help of Gods
Spirit. 1 Cor. 2. 12. For he has that witness in himself. 1 John 5. 10.
Indeed while he is a Babe in Christ, it may be he knows not a Babe is a Babe,
though he understand it not he understands as a babe. 1 Cor. 13. 11. Yea in
the time of temptation too, a man is a man, though in aswound, he knows it
not, in such a cause David may fear he is cast of for ever. Psalm. 77. 7. Also
when passions are violent, as over much grief, or over much joy. Luke 24. 41.
But a child of God when his unbelief is at the worst, has an inckling that
he does believe. Mark 9. 24. Or props himself at least with this belief,
that he has believed. 2 Cor. 4. 13. How soever Faith brings evidence and
assurance with it at the last. Heb. 11. 1.

Q. 25. What say you of them that have the Spirit of bondage?
A. The child of God had it once* but then he has it no more to fear again.
Romans 8. 15. Those that think they have assurance, and sometimes conceit they
are aright, and sometimes fear not, the Lord joins such with unbeleevers. Rev.
21. 8. They live in darkness, and know not whether they go, whether to Heaven
or to Hell. John 12. 25. The godly may fall sometimes into such fears, that
Christ may upbraid them. How is it ye have no Faith. Mark 4. 41. But they are
restless till their Election and calling be made sure, and therefore they are
diligent about it. 2 Pet. 1. 10.

Q. 26. How many objects of Faith are there that thou may believe?
A. I must believe in one Lord. Ephesians 4. 5. Distinguished into three persons. 1
John 5. 7. First, in God the Father, 1 Pet. 1. 21. Secondly, in Christ. John
14. 1. Thirdly, in God the holy Ghost. Math. 28. 19. So far forth as it is
written in the word. John 20. 31. Which is a word of Faith. Romans 16. 8. A
plain and an easy word, that the simple may be converted by it, Psalm. 19. 7
Psalm. 119. 130. It is a perfect word, able to make the man of God perfect. 2 Timothy
3. 17. Whatsoever men, or Counsels, or traditions, or Angels from Heaven say; I
must go to the word, if they speak not according to it, there is no truth in
them. Isa. 8. If Paul himself were now alive, and should Preach any thing
besides it, he were accursed* Gal. 1. 8. It is a damnable sin to add toit,
Rev. 22. 18. Or to take a tittle from it, verse. 19. ^is able to convince all
gainsayers, without running to this or that man's Expositions of it, the
^criptures themselves show their own meanings, Acts 18. 28.

Q. 27. But may not men give their Expositions ^^to it?
A. There must be an interpreting of the lord, people understand not the
Original tongue ^^ it, 1 Cor. 14. 5. And an expounding too, Luke ^4. 27. But
no man may give their own sense to ^^ but the sense of the word. Neh. 8. 8. For
the ^^me Christ that spoke the dark speeches and Pa^ables, the same Christ does
expound them, Mar. ^. 34. The holy Ghost speaking in the Scriptures, Heb. 3. 7.
Teaches the right meaning. John 14. ^6.

Q. 28. How is this?
A. By sundry ways. First, by conferring places with places, as Micah 5. 2.
with Math. 2. 6. Secondly, by the scope, as if I would know Peter's meaning, why
he said, that David's Sepul^her was then to be seen. Act. 2. 29. I may see the
scope of that speech, verse. 31. Thirdly, observing whether the word be proper
or figurative John 15. 1. and many others.

Q. 29. What say you more of the Word?
A. It undertakes to be a rule to all that we do, to the wearing of our hair.
1 Cor. 11. 14. Or of ^ Garment. 1 Pet. 3. 3. To our eating and drinking. 1 Cor.
10. 31. To our marketting and Marchandizing. Iam 4. 13. Not so little as a
shoo^yer, but if it be amiss, the word does condemn it. Isa. 3. 18. Not so
little as an idle word, but the word does tax it. Math. 12. 36. Not so little
as a thought, but it must be according to the Word. 2 Cor. 10. 5. What ever we
think, say, or do, we must be careful to observe the judgment of the word,
and lay it before us. Psalm. 119. 30.

Q. 30. Why do thou say, I believe in God?
A. For three reasons. First, because I do not believe unbelief, I go out of
my self, and deny my self. Math. 16. 24. Secondly, unless I cast my self
upon God, and rely on him. 2 Chronicles. 20. 20. Thirdly, unless not only
naturally, but also spiritually, I be in him, move in him, and live in him.
Act. 17. 28.

Q. 31. Why do thou believe in God as a Father Almighty?
A. First, that in my greatest dangers I may depend upon him who is able to
deliver me. Dan. 3. 17. This I must believe. Math. 9. 28. Secondly, that in my
greatest temptations, I may not dare to sin against him, for I am not stronger
then he. 1 Cor. 10. 22.

Q 32. Why maker of Heaven and Earth?
A. First, that I may consider I am Created of God and for God to live holily,
for the wicked are for the day of evil. Prove. 16. 4. Secondly, that I glorify
God in my soul and body, for they are not mine but Gods. 1 Cor. 6, 20.
Thirdly, that I abuse none of his Creatures, for they are all unto Gods praise.
Psalm. 145, 10. Nor profane them, for God is holy in them. ver. 17. But have
pleasure to search Gods greatness in them. Psalm. 111. 2. And see the invisible
things of God in them. Romans 1. 20. And consider them. Math. 6. 28. And meditate
on them. Psalm. 143.

And learn Parables or Similitudes for Spiritual things out of them. Math.
24. 32. For God teaches me by such Similitudes. Hos. 12. 10.

Q. 33. Why do thou believe in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord?
A. For two reasons. First, that I may be justified freely by his Grace, Romans
3. 24. Who though he knew no sin, yet was made sin for me* that I might be
made the righteousness of God in him. 2 Cor. 5. 21. Secondly, that look
whatsoever he did, or suffered, or had, may be woven in a mystery into my
heart; if this mystery had not been in Paul, he himself had been a reprobate.
2 Cor. 13. 5. 6.

Q. 34. Must that then which was a history in Christ, be a mystery in us?
A. Yea by the application of all these articles concerning Christ to our
souls, I must be an adopted Son of God. 1 John 3. 1. Christ must be formed
and conceived in me. Gal. 4. 19. I must suffer with Christ. Romans 8. 17. And
mine old man must be crucified in me, and sin dye in me. Romans 6. 6. I must be
crucified to the world, and the world unto me. Gal. 6. 14. I must be buried
with him and raised up again to a new life. Col. 2. 12. And seek the things
above in Heaven. Col. 3. 1. And judge my self here, otherwise I shall be
judged and condemned of the Lord. 1 Cor. 11. 31.

Q. 35. Why do thou say, Christ was conceived of the Holy Ghost, etc.
A. He was conceived. Luke 1. 31. By the holy Ghost, ver 35. for the woman was
found with child of the Holy Ghost. Math. 1. 18. Supernaturally that his
conception might be without sin. ver. 20. For all others are conceived in sin,
Psa. 51. 5. Because that which is borne of the flesh is flesh. John 3. 6. And
yet the Holy Ghost made him of a woman. Gal. ^. 4. And he was borne of her.
Math. 1. 1^. Being the seed of a woman. Genesis 3. 15. Of the seed of David. Romans
1. 3. The root of Iesse. Isa. 11. 10. He suffered under Pontius Pilate who
gave sentence that he should be Crucified. Luke 23. 24. And scourged him and
delivered him up to death. Mark 15. 15. Under whom he had witnessed a good
confession. 1 Tin^. 6. 15. And therefore Christ is said to be crucified at Rome
the great City of Antichrist. Rev. 11. 8. Because Pontius Pilate who delivered
him, to be Crucified, was governor under Tiberius Caesar Emperor of Rome. 3^1.

Q. 36. Did Christ suffer in Soul too?
A. Yea: for his Soul was exceeding sorrowful even unto death. Math. 26. 38.
His Soul was an offering for sin as well as his body. Isa. 53. 10. Whole
Christ was surely for us. Heb. ^. 22. And a curse for us. Gal. 3. 13. For our
Souls have need of Redemption as well as our bodies. Psalm. 49. 8. It is a
sign he suffered greater torments then bodily, by his sweat in the garden
which was a bloody sweat. Luke 22. 44. And by his lamentable speech on the
Cross my God my God why have thou forsaken me. Math. 27. 46. And by his not
tasting of the first death of us. Heb. 2. 9. But also keeping of the second
death from hurting us. Rev. 2. 11.

Q. 37. How is hell taken in Scripture?
A. First, for the Grave. Isa. 14. 9. Secondly, Hell is taken for the fears of
Hell. Psalm. 116. 3. Thirdly, Hell is taken for the place of the damned after
this life. Luke 16. 23. Fourthly, for the hidden parts of the earth. Psalm. 139.
8. Fifthly, Hell is taken for the Devil and whatsoever is hellish. Rev. 20. 14.
Sixthly, for the lowest degree of Christ's humiliation. Acts 2. 27.

Q, 38. What say thou of Christ's diseent into Hell?
A. Not as though he descended to hell to suffer there the pains of the
damned, for he said upon the Cross it is finished. John 19. 5. Or to deliver
the Souls of the Patriarch and Fathers of old out of Limbo, for they were
glorified before. Math. 17. 3. And in Paradise by the virtue of Christ's death,
he being the ^amb slain from the foundation of the world, Rev. 13. 8. Or to
Preach to Souls there in prison. 1 Pet. 3. 19. For that was his Spirit,
Preaching in the mouth and days of Noah while they were alive, ver. 20. or to
triumph over Hell and Devils, for that he did upon the Cross. Col. 2. 15. Nor
as though he descended Locally at all into Hell for all that we know for dying
he said unto the good Thief, This day shall thou be with me in Paradise. Luke
23. 43. And he commended his Spirit into the hands of his Father in Heaven,
verse. 46.

Q. 39. Is it not an Article of Faith, and has it not its meaning?
A. Yea it is an Article of Faith, though the Greek Church has omitted it in
their Creed, taken out of Scripture. Acts 2. ^1. And by this same descent into
hell, is meant Christ's lowest degree of humiliation, opposed in the height of
his exaltation and ascension. Ephesians. 4, 10. For he was not only dead, but
hidden of death for a while, though he could not be held quite. Acts 2. 24. How
soever this descent into hell be understood, we are sure by this means his
people shall never descend into he^^. Romans 8. 1.

Q. 40. What beleevest thou of Christ's rising the third day?
A. He rose again, not by re-uniting his body to his Godhead, for they were
never severed by death, for being Crucified, he was still the Lord of glory. 1
Cor. 2. 8. But by re-uniting Soul and body together, and taking his life
again, which before he had laid down. John 10. 17. And he himself had power
to do it. verse. 18. To be Lord of quick and dead. Romans 14. 9. And this he
did the third day. 1 Cor. 15. 4. Namely, the third day from his suffering
passively, verse. 3. And therefore the space is called by the Scripture, the
space of three days. John 2. 19. And because that every day has a night
belonging to it, it is called the space of three nights too. Math. 12. 40. That
as by man came death, so by man also might come the resurrection of the dead. 1
Cor: 13. 21. Himself being the first fruits of them that sleep, verse. 20. And
the first borne from the dead. Col. 1. 18. And the first begotten of the dead:
Rev. 1. 5. And dies no more. Romans 6. 9. And therefore those that rose before
Christ, as the Shunamites child. 2 Kings 4. 35. And Lazarus and the rest rose
again to a mortal life. John 11. 44.

Q. 41. Why did Christ rise again?
A. He rose again for the glory of God and the good of all the Elect, Romans 6.
4. That they might be glorified, Romans 4. 25. For if he had not risen they had
still been in their sins, 1 Cor. 15. 17. This article was a comfort to Job
and all before the coming of Christ, Job. 19. 25. And is to be remembered of
all the people of God, as a comfort against all troubles, namely that Jesus
Christ is risen from the dead, 2 Timothy 2, 8. and for diver other reasons did he
rise.

Q. 42. What believe you conceerning the other two Articles?
A, He aseended into heaven, John 3, 13. and was seen so doing, John 6. 62.
being taken up, Acts 1. 9, and he went up, verse. 10. whether the bodies of the
Saints are not yet ascended, no not David's, Acts 2. 34. though their souls do
ascend as soon as they are dissolved from their bodies to be with Christ,
Phil. 1. 23. and the Heavens must receive him till the times of restitution,
Acts 3. 21. and therefore in respect of his body we have him not with us here
on earth, John 12. 8. But only Sacramentally in his Supper, 1 Cor. 11. 24. And
he sits now at the right hand of God, Col. 3. 1. in the throne of his
Father, Rev. 3. 21. being preferred even in his humane nature, above all
Angels, and all Principalities and powers, Ephesians. 1. 20, 21. expecting till his
enemies be made his footstool, Heb. 10. 13. Where Steven saw him standing up
as in his defense, Acts 7. 55. and where he makes intercession for his
redeemed, Romans 8. 24. As being their one only Mediator, 1 Timothy 2. 5.

Q. 43. What believe you of Christ's judging the world?
A. He is ordained of God to be Judge of quick and dead, Acts 10. 42. Not
only men, but Angels to the day, when, being called the great day, Jude 6. He
shall come to do it visibly, Acts 1. 11. And according to those truths which
are contained in the Gospel. Romans 2. 16. and as men may find their doom in
the word, so they must expect it, John 12. 48. His Saints too, by their lives
shall judge all the world that are not Saints, 1 Cor. 6. 2. The set day, and
hour, and time, knows no man, nor the Angels, no not Christ himself as man,
Mark 13. 32. Though a man's particular judgment be as he dies, Heb. 9. 27.
either to Heaven or to Hell, Luke 16. 22, 23.

Q. 44. What is the Office of Christ?
A. He is our Mediator, Heb. 12. 24. and he that makes intercession for us,
Heb. 7. 25. appearing in the presence of God for us, Heb. 9. 24. and perfuming
the Prayers of his members with the odours of his merits, whenever they pray
in his name, Rev. 8. 3, 4. In this sense, no mere creature can be a Mediator
to entreat for us, 1 Samuel 2. 25. And therefore it is in another sense, that the
Prayers of Saints living upon earth when they pray for other men, are called
intercessions, 1 Timothy 2. 1. and we must pray them to pray for us; Heb. 13. 18.
though not when they be dead, for then they be ignorant of us, yea though it
be Abraham himself, Isa. 63. 16. The dead know not any thing of the affairs
of this life, Eccl. 9. 5. The Lord counts it an absurd thing, that the living
should seek unto the dead, Isa. 8. 19. when once their souls go away hence
they ^e no more to appear to us, Psalm. 39. 13. Neither have we any warrant to
pray the Angels to pray for us, though they be sent forth to minister for us,
Heb. 1. 14. Nor to speak unto them, unless it be in a Rhetorieall strain to
bless the Lord, Psalm. 103. 20.

Q. 45. Why did Christ take the office of a Mediator upon him?
A. Because he was elected of God for this purpose, Isa. 42. 1. and
foreordained, 1 Pet. 1. 20. and sealed, John 6. 27. and Sanctified, John 10.
36. And given of God for the life of believers, John 3. 16. not only to help
sinners with a possibility of salvation that they might be saved, ver. 17. but
to convert sinners, 1 Timothy 1. 15. This was the agreement made between his
Father and him, that he should have a seed, and that the Redemption which he
purchased should actually prosper, Isa. 53. 10. this was trinsicall end he
looked at, namely, that he might purchase to himself a peculiar people, Tit. 2.
14.

Q. 46. Which be the particular Offices of Christ?
A. He was Anointed, Isa. 61. 1. First to be our Prophet, to whom we must
hearken as long as we live, Deuteronomy. 18. 15. Secondly, our merciful and
faithful high Priest, to reconcile us to God, Heb. 2. 17. and King of Saints,
Rev. 15. 3. For first we were desperately ignorant of God, and he only can
reveal God unto us, Math. 11. 27. Secondly, we were desperately alienated,
being the enemies of God, and he only can reconcile us, Col. 1. 21. Thirdly,
we were desperately disabled, and could never have applied this Redemption unto
us, he only can make us Kings over sin and death, Rev. 1. 6.

Q. 47. Who is he that in effect denies Christ's Offices, and teaches men so?
A. The Pope and his Church, for though he seem to sit in the Temple of God,
2 These. 2. 4. and have the horn of the Lamb, as though he were Christ's Vicar
and friend, yet he speaks like the Dragon, Rev. 13. 11. And therefore he is
said to deny Christ, 1 John 2. 22.

Q. 48. How does he deny Christ's Offices?
A. First, because he denies Christ's Prophetical Office, he coins new
Articles of Faith, and therefore he is called the false Prophet, Rev. 12. 20.
Secondly, because he denies Christ's Priestly Office, for he undertakes to
offer Christ in the Sacrament, whereas Christ was only once offered, Heb. 9.
28. He has invented satisfactions and penances, and Purgatory, to expiate for
sin, whereas Christ trod the wine press alone, Isa. 63. 3. Thirdly, because
he denies Christ's Kingly Office, for he applies that to himself, which
Christ spoke of himself, Math. 28. 18. and takes it only to himself, 1 Timothy
6. 15.

Q. 49. Does he deny no more of Christ?
A. He makes himself the head of the Church, whereas Christ only is the head,
1 Cor. 11. 3. this Office being given him only of God, Ephesians. 1. 22. He
makes Peter and himself the mark which was meant of Peter's confession, that
he made, Math. 16. 18. Namely, Christ the Son of God, verse. 16. for he only
is the Rock, 1 Cor. 10. 4. the Rock of all our Salvation, Deuteronomy. 32. 15. And who
is this Rock save our God, Psalm. 18. 31.

Q. 50. Why do thou believe in God the Holy Ghost?
A. That he may apply Christ unto me to Justification, 1 Cor. 6. 11. That he
may transform me into the image of God, 2 Cor. 3. 18. And make his graces
fruitful in me, Gal. 5. 22. that he may teach me all truth, and put me in
remembrance of Gods word, John 14. 26. and lead me to walk uprightly, Psalm.
143. 10. That he may comfort me in all Temptations, Acts 9. 31. helping me with
grows in my Prayers, Romans 8. 26. That he may witness with my Spirit, that I
am Gods child, verse. 16. that he whom the world knows not, may abide with me
for ever, Ioh. 14. 16. For if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none
of his, Romans 8. 9.

Q. 51. What do thou believe the Holy Ghost, does more?
A. I believe that the Spirit makes me a member of one Body, 1 Cor. 12. 13.
Namely, the holy Catholic Church of Christ, which is spoken of, Rev. 7. 9.
which is the body of Christ, Col. 1. 18. and consists only of Saints and
Professors of holiness, 1 Cor. 14. 33. Whereof if any walk scandalously, they
are to be admonished, and if they will not be reclaimed, they must be
accounted as Heathens, Math. 18. 17. and cast out of the Church, though proud
Diothephes abused this power, 3. John 10. and delivered up to Satan, for the
destruction of the Flesh, that the Spirit may be humbled, and so saved if it
may be possible, 1 Cor. 5. 5. That they may learn not to blaspheme nor cause
the Word to be blasphemed, 1 Timothy 1. 20. The visible Church have some among
them which are not of them, 1 Ioh. 2. 19. But the true Church which is called
Invisible, because the world cannot see which persons they be, are only them
which shall be saved, Acts 2. 47.

Q. 48. Wherein does the Communion of Saints consist?
A. In two things; first, in Fellowship with Christ the head, 1 Ioh. 2. 5.
Secondly, in fellowship with the Saints, ver 7. and so it consists in 7
things; First, in Unity, Ephesians. 4. 3. 4, 5 etc. Secondly, in keeping company
with them. Psalm. 16. 3. Thirdly, in Praying for them, Ephesians. 6, 18. Fourthly,
in Fellowship, compassion* and bowels. Phil. 2 1, 2. Fifthly, in helping one
another out of Sin, Gal. 6. 1. and provoking one another to goodness, Heb. 10.
24. Sixthly, in imitating the lives of the Saints, 1 These. 1. 6. as they imitate
Christ, 1 Cor. 11. 1. Seventhly, in relieving them that lack, to the very
selling of ones goods if need require. Acts 4. 34.

Q. 53. What believe thou concerning Remission of Sins?
A. I believe, that all that believe in Christ receive re^^ission of Sins, Acts
10. 43. I cannot truly say I am sick of it, but my sins are forgiven me,
Isa. 33. 24. blotted out and remembered in heaven no more, Isa. 43. 25. nor
imputed to me, Psalm. 32. 2. but drowned in the Sea, Mich. 7. 19. Namely, of
Christ's blood, Ephesians. 1. 7 which cleanses me from all Sin, and I know my
Belief is right, if I walk in the light, 1 John 1. 7. For who so have not
destroyed the works of the Dwell in them, Christ was never yet manifest to
them, 1 John 3. 8. Those that sin against the Holy Ghost, shall never be
forgiven, Math. 12. 32. Neither are such as go on in their guilty Consciences,
forgiven, Exodus 31. 7. nor such as provoke* Christ, and obey not his voice,
Exodus 23. 21. Yet God is a God ready to Pardon, Nehem. 9. 17. Upon true
Repentance and Faith answerable to the vow in Baptism, Acts 2. 38.

Q. 54. What believe thou concerning the Resurrection of the Body?
A. Though flesh and blood count it incredible, Acts 26. 8. nevertheless by
Faith I know it is true, Joh. 11. 24. And that these very eyes shall rise and
see my Redeemer, Job 19. 27. though the worms have eaten up all my Flesh,
verse. 26. yea, though my body were drowned and devoured of Fishes, Rev. 20.
13. though the substance be the same, Justice requiring that the same bodies
that sinned should be damned, and Mercy requiring, that the same bodies that
glorified God should be saved, 2 Cor. 5. 10. Nevertheless, I believe that the
qualities and accidences shall be altered; namely, that this very mortal
shall put on Immortality, 1 Cor. 15. 53. This dishonorable shall put on glory,
this weak shall put on Power, verse. 43. this natural body shall be raised a
more Spiritual body, verse. 44. and bear the image of the heavenly, verse.
49. though it be dispiersed into a thousand thousand pieces by Corruption, yet
Christ will loose nothing of it, Joh. 6. 39. And therefore my Flesh shall not
rest in hope, Psalm. 16. 9. of the Redemption of my Body, Romans 8. ^3. That
mortality may be swallowed up of Life, 2 Cor. 5. 4. Though my soul while it is
absent from my body, be present in the mean time with the Lord, verse. 8. having
returned to God that gave it, Eccles, 12. 7.

Q. 55. What believe thou more of the Resurrection?
A. That there shall be a Resurrection both of the just and also the unjust,
Acts 24. 15. The one to life the other to damnation, John 5. 29. For Christ is
the Judge of quick and dead, Acts 10. 42. And therefore though it be
appointed unto men once to dye, nevertheless not to dye as beasts but to come
to judgment, Heb. 9. 27. The Angels being instruments of gathering them, and
sending them to Christ's bar with a Trumpet, Math. 24. 31. not a material
Trump, but with the trumpe of God, and with a shout, and the dead shall rise
first, 1 These. 4. 16. Then those that are alive shall be caught up to meet
Christ in the air, verse. 17. being changed in a moment, 1 Cor. 15. 52.
Blessed and holy is he, that has part in the first Resurrection from sin
unto holiness here, Rev. 20. 6. for he shall go into life eternal, but the
rest into everlasting punishment, Math. 25. 46.

Q. 56. What believe thou concerning the last Article, namely Life
everlasting?
A. I believe it is the inheritance proper to the Saints, who, in this life are
made meet to be partakers of it, Col. 1. 12. Which is a Kingdom, Math. 25. 34.
consisting, First in the beatificall vision and sight of God as he is, 1 Ioh.
3. 2. Secondly, in entire likeness with God, Psalm. 17. 15. Thirdly, in
fullness of joy and pleasure everlasting in Christ, Psalm. 16. 11. Fourthly, in
having no need of the Creature, Rev. 22. 5. but inheriting all things in God,
Rev. 21. 7. Fifthly, in freedom from all troubles and grievances, and
imperfections of this life, verse. 4. The Blessedness of it cannot enter into
the heart of man to conceive it, it is so great, 1 Cor. 2. 9. It is such a holy
Kingdom, that no unholy person may have it, 1 Cor. 6. 9. and if he were their
suppose that were possible which is impossible, 1 Cor. 15. 50. Yet he could
have no happiness there, for there dwells nothing but Righteousness, 2 Pet.
3. 13.

Q. 57. The wicked say they believe all this, but do they?
A. Indeed they believe the history of God and his Word, Iam. 2. 19. otherwise
they believe a falsehood or a lie, Ierem. 13. 25. and therefore though they
expect to be saved on their deathbeds, when they dye they shall perish, Prove.
11. 7. Though they cry, Lord, Lord open the gates of heaven to us, yet he will
not open it unto them, Math. 25. 11, 12. God that made them will never save
them, Isa. 27. 11. and though they dye with Lord, Lord have mercy upon me, in
their mouths, Math. 7. 21. and so go away like Lambs, they shall lie in the
grave of Hell, as thick as Sheep in a sheep-cote, Psalm. 49. 14.

Q. 58. How many Commandments are there?
A. Ten, ten Words, Exodus 34. 28. God added no more, Deuteronomy. 5. 22. Which are the
rule of my steps, Psalm. 119. 133. continually, verse. 117. in my memory, verse.
109. in mine understanding, verse. 130. being my meditation always, verse. 97.
that I may refrain my life from every Sin, verse. 101. Idle vain thoughts and
all, verse. 113. and indeare them unto me above thousands of Gold and Silver,
verse. 72.

Q. 59. What rules are to help us in the right understanding of the Law?
A. Six more especially; First, that the Law is Spiritual, so spiritual that
the best Saint is carnal in comparison of it, Romans 7. 14. reaching to all the
heart, soul mind, strength, Luke 10. 27. Secondly, that it is perfect, Psalm.
19. 7. commanding Obedience to every tittle, if a man do but once Sin it does
curse him, Gal. 3. 10. Thirdly, when it forbids or commands any thing, it
forbids or commands all means, occasions, or provocations thereunto; and
therefore the least amorous look, is Adultery, Math. 5. 28. The least hatred,
is Murder, 1 Ioh. 3. 15. Fourthly, whatsoever the Law forbids, it
commands the contrary, 1 Pet. 3. 11. Whatsoever it commands it forbids
the contrary, Levit. 19. 17. Fifthly, it runs upon Negatives for negatives
bind strongly, this being the nature of a No, no in no wise, Romans 3. 9. the
Firmative binds always, but not to all moments, but the Negative binds to
both, Luke 21. 34. Sixthly, its put in the second Person, that every soul may
apply it, Mal. 2. 1.

Q. 60. Who be under the Law, the Rigor of the law, and the Curse of the law?
A. All disobedient persons that are not made righteous by Christ, 1 Timothy 1. 9.
Even the whole world, whether Christian Professors or not, except they be led
by the Spirit of God, Gal. 5. 18. bounded to do the Law to the utmost, as a
wife is bound to her husband, Romans 7. 2. and therefore the Law has dominion
over them as long as they live, verse. 1. and the Curse too, Gal. 3. 10. And
whatsoever the rigor of the Law says, its spoken directly to them, Romans 3.
19. but Believers in whom sin does not reign, they are not under the Law but
under Grace, Romans 6. 14 nevertheless they must not think the Law to be of
none effect to them, Romans 3. 31. But first they must consent to the goodness
of it, Romans 7. 16. Secondly* get the knowledge of their sins more and more by
it. verse. 7. Thirdly sling mire and dirt in their own faces, by reason of it,
verse. 2. ^ Fourthly, delight in it as a blessed rule of life, verse. 22.
Fifthly, be moved by it to thankfulness to Christ* verse. 25. Sixthly, be
schooled by it to hang faster upon Christ* Gal. 2. 24. Seventhly, to take heed
of the madness of their flesh, that desires rather to be under the Law though
never so cruel, then to be under Christ, Gal. 4. 21.

Q. 61. Wherefore serves the Preface: I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee
out of the Land of Egypt, out of the bondage?
A. Two teach me; First, that I cannot wholly obey, except I believe God is my
God, Josh. 14. 8. and be one of the Israel of God, Gal. 6. 16. Secondly, that
the consideration of what God has done for me, is a motive to obey him, Josh.
24. 31. Thirdly, that I am forgetful of old mercies; and therefore the Lord
persuades me to obedience with the newest and latest, Exodus 20. 2. Fourthly,
that the Spiritual meaning of this deliverance, from Egyptian bondage
concerns all that are delivered from Satan and sin, Heb. 2. 15.

Q. 62. Are the duties of the first Table, greater then the duties of the
second?
A. Yea, because they are the first and the great Commandments, Math. 22. 38.
First, because the object of them, which is God, is greater then man, Job 33.
12. Secondly, because the performance of them is the immediate worship of God,
and he that sins against his neighbor, does more immediately sin against God,
1 Cor. 8. 12. Thirdly, they moderate the duties of the second; as for example*
the duty of obedience to Parents, otherwise it is not right, Ephesians. 6. 1. And
yet with these cautions, first that the comparison be equally made of the
chief of the first Table, with the chief of the second; of the middle with
the middle, of the least with the least, otherwise not, Isa. 1. 15. Secondly,
that our obedience to the second, is an argument of our obedience to the first,
1 John 4. 20. Thirdly, that the obedience to both, is inseparable, holiness
and righteousness, ever go together, Luke 1. 75.

Q, 63. What art thou commanded in the first, Thou shall have no other Gods but
me?
A. To know God and believe him, Isa. 43. ^0. and in him, 2 Chronicles. 20. 20. and
in no other God, Psalm. 81. 9. This Commandment bids me keep all the rest,
Deuteronomy. 11. 22. Not only to obey him, in what he commanded at the first, but
any Commandment he would afterward give, Heb. 11. 17. And therefore this
Commandment binds me now to believe in Jesus Christ, 1 Ioh. 3. 23. to rely
upon God for all things, 2 Chronicles. 16. 8. Courageously to wait upon God, Psalm.
27. 14. To walk before God, as a servant before his Master, Genesis 17. 1. In all
my ways to think of God* and to acknowledge him, Prove. 3. 6. To be merry in
him evermore, Phil. 4. 4. to fear him and to serve him, Deuteronomy. 6. 13. To turn
the desires of my Soul to him, and to the remembrance of him, Isa. 26 8. To
labor more after him, then after meat or drink, or any thing in this perising
world, John 6. 27. To make him the end and scope of all mine actions, not only
Spiritual, but also civil, and natural, 1 Cor. 10. 31.

Qu. 64. Now because we must serve God, and fear him, and love him, and trust
in him, and so forth, according to his Attributes, which be they?
A. He is uncompounded, simple, and perfectly one, Deuteronomy. 6. 4. Immutable and
unvariable, Iam. 1. 17. and therefore he cannot be said to Repent, 1 Samuel 15.
29. but only improperly in regard of the effects, Genesis 6. 6. Infinite in
greatness, the heaven of heavens is not able to contain him, 1 Kings 8. 27.
being every where present, Psalm. 139. 7. Infinite in eternity, from everlasting
to everlasting, Psalm. 90. 2. Not by succession of time but he is for ever I
am, Exodus* 3. 14. Infinite in Power, for he is Almighty; Genesis 17. 1. Nothing is
unpossible to him, Luke 1. 37. unless it be to do evil, that is, a weakness
and no power; and therefore unpossible to him, Heb. 6. 18. Infinite in
knowledge, he knows all things, Ioh. 21. 7. Not by discourse one after
another, but all together, Psalm. 139. 4. most free in his Will, he does
whatsoever he will, Psalm. 115. 3. His will being the cause of all things,
Ephesians. 1. 11. Abundant in goodness, mercy, gracious in patience and Truth,
Exodus 34. 6. and Justice, verse. 7. and Holiness, 1 Pet. 1. 16. of terrible
Majesty, Job 37. 22. most happy and blessed for ever, Romans 11. 36. and so
forth?

Q. 65. How do the attributes of God concern thine obedience to God,
especially in this first Commandment?
A. First God is simple as a Spirit; therefore he must be served in spirit and
truth, John 4. 24. and I must do every thing with simplicity, 2 Cor. 1. 12.
Secondly, God is un-alterable; therefore I must trust in his Covenant, Psalm.
89. 34. neither change nor meddle with them that do, but be constant in his
fear, Prove. 24. 21. Yet I must repent, and so change my life, for God also
repents of the evil, Joel, 2. 13. Thirdly, if God fill heaven and earth, J
must be conscious that wheresoever I am God is, Ierem. 23. 24. Fourthly, if God
be eternal, then he is the Eternal life that I must seek, 1 John 5. 20. and
count him my continual refuge, Deuteronomy. 33. 27. Fifthly, if God be Almighty, then
I must not stand out against his chastenings, Job 5. 17. but fear him, Job 6.
14. and humble my self betime before him, Job 8. 5. and return to him, for
there is no escaping out of his hand, Job 22. 23. Sixthly, if God know all
things, then I must be conscious that he sees my thoughts, Math. 9. 4. and
all my Secrets, Math. 6. 18. And so of the rest.

Q. 66. What art thou commanded in the second Commandment?
A. Not to serve God with Will Worship, though it seem never so wise and
humble, and mortifying, Colos. 2. 23. To abhor all gross thoughts of God,
Act. 17. 29. as that he is such a one, as men's selves do think him to be,
Psalm. 50. 21. not to make any Image, Deuteronomy. 5. 8. Unless God should specially
reveal a new Commandment, as once he did for Cherubims in the Sanctuary,
Exodus 25. 18. and the brazen Serpent in the Wilderness, Numb. 21. 8. or
unless it be in a Civil use, Math. 22. 10. To abhor Images of Idolaters,
either to worship God before them, 2 Chronicles. 25. 14. or in them, as the Jews
did God in Baal, Hos. 2. 16. or to be put in mind of God by them, verse. 17. or
being at Mass or communion of Service with them, 1 Cor. 10. 21. or housing
them, 2 John 10. or bidding them God speed, verse. 11. or learning any of their
devises or customs of them, Deuteronomy. 12. 30. or familiar reading their books,
Acts 19. 19. Unless it be to confute them by their own Writers, Acts 17. 28.
and to upbraid carnal Professors, with their strictness in their kind, Romans
2. 14, 15, 16, 17, etc.

Q. 67. What else art thou commanded in the second Commandment?
A. Not to lean to mine own knowledge, Prove. 3. 5. nor to serve God by the
precepts of men, Esa. 29. 13. nor as men bid me, Mark 7. 6. nor according to
the Traditions and customs of the lives of our forefathers, 1 Pet. 1. 18. I
am commanded to do, not only in matter what, but also in manner, as the Lord
commands. Gen 6. 22. For otherwise my prayers and services that I do unto
God, and all my Sacrifices, and oblations, are no better then murder, or a Dogs
neck, or Swines blood, or Idolatry, so indeed it as, if I serve him after my
own ways, Isa. 66. 3. not only sticks and stones are Idols, Levit. 26. 1.
But carnal fancies, imaginations, dullness, deadness, luke-warmnesse; for
their be Idols in the heart, Ezec. 14. 3. 4. Covetousness is Idolatry, Col. 3.
5. Stubbornness is as Idolatry, 1 Samuel 15. 23. A careless Christian is an
Idol, there is an idol Professor, an idol Christian, an idol Shepherd,
Zach. 11. 17.

Q. 68. What art thou commanded in the third Commandment?
A. To glorify the name of God, Rev. 15. 4. that is, his Titles and
Attributes, Exodus 34. 5. his Law, Deuteronomy. 32. 3. his Ordinances, as Prayer, and
hearing of his Word, and the like, Deuteronomy. 12. 5. his Gospel, Act. 9. 15. the
profession of Christ, Math. 10. 22. His censures, as Excommunication, and
delivering men up unto Satan, 1 Cor. 5. 4. His Sacraments, Math. 28. 19. All
his worship, Mal. 1. 11. his Meditation, Luke 24. 47. and that not only in
tongue or lips, Heb. 13. 15. but also in heart, Psalm. 86. 11. and in every
action, Prove. 30. 9. If any man or woman do not their duty; as for example,
Servants, or any others, they cause Gods name to be blasphemed, 1 Timothy 6. 1. So
also if any man break the Law of God, he is guilty of other men's blaspheming
Gods name, Romans 2. 24. Likewise if a Brother, or Sister walks scandalously,
they profane Gods name, Ezec. 36. 20.

Q. 68. What more art thou commanded in the third Commandment?
A. To fear God and swear by his Name, Deuteronomy. 6. 13. with a Soule-bowing oath,
Isa. 45. 23. which is a wholly confessing of God, Romans 14. 11. and an oath of
Covenant, Isa. 19. 18. and in some solemn cases with a renewed oath, Deuteronomy. 10.
20. Either given hy others, and so willingly taken, 2 Chronicles. 15. 14. or freely
of ones self, Psalm. 119. 106. if need require by Oath before the Magistrate;
but then it must be in Truth, and righteousness, and judgment, Ier. 4. 2.
and if necessity of weight be in private agreements, Genesis 26. 31. As for
performance of ones last Will and Testament, Genesis 47. 31. or to clear ones
self and graciously to satisfy a Brother, 1 Samuel 20. 3. yea now under the
Gospel too, Isa. 65. 16. And in some cases a Minister may swear in the
Pulpit, to make the People believe, 2 Cor. 1. 13. and in more private
threatenings from God, 1 Kings 17. 1.

Q. 70. What art thou forbidden in the third Commandment?
A. I am forbidden in common talk Swearing, Math. 3. 5. least I fall into
damnation, Iam. 5. 12. and bring all the Curses in Gods book on my house,
Zach. 5. 2, 3. and cause the very Land to mou nre, Ierem. 23. 10. It was the
brand of a Saul to be a common Swearer, 1 Samuel 14. 24. 39, 44. 1 Samuel 19. 6.
1. and 28. 10. And that whether it be in broken Oaths, as God, and the Lord
lives, Ierem. 5. 2. Or in Idolatrous oaths, for they are a double sin; as
by this Light or by Baal, Ier. 12. 16. Or any other hideous oaths, as by the
Passion of Christ, or by the Lord himself, or by Milchom, Zeph. 1. 5. The
profane use of Swearing is a bloody sin, Swearing, Lying, and Killing are
put together; for which the Lord has a controversy with Men Hos. 4. 2 Nay, if
a man hear an Oath, and do not utter a reproof, he is guilty of the sin.
Levit. 5. 1. and if for every idle word, a man shall give account before God
the last day, what then shall he do for his Oaths, Math. 12. 36. Swearing is
a cursing of ones self, Math. 26. 74. but chiefly I am forbidden all false
Swearing, Levit. 19. 12. for that pulls Christ swiftly against one, Mal. 3. 5.

Q. 71. What art thou forbidden more in the third Commandment?
A. First, all taking Gods name in vain, as O God, O Lord, Deuteronomy. 5. 11.
Secondly, the formal repeating these words, The Lord be with thee, or the
like, 1 Samuel 17. 37. I thank God I do so and so, Luke 18. 11. Thirdly, vain
repetitions, as Lord have mercy upon us, Christ have mercy upon us, Lord have
mercy upon us; as Papists and babbling Battuses use them, Math. 6. 7. Yet
repetitions that proceed out of a broken zealous heart be holy, Dan. 9. 18,
19. Fourthly, the abuse of Lots, for their disposing is of God, Prove. 16. 33.
and were Sacredly used. First, for the deciding of Controversies, Prove. 18. 18.
Secondly, for Elections, 1 Samuel 10. 21. Thirdly, for dividing of Portions,
Numb. 26. 55. Fourthly the finding out of an Offender, Josh. 7. 14. for they
were joined with Prayer, Acts 1. 24, 26. resting on Gods determination, Josh.
14. 2. being a Divine thing by the light of nature, Jonah 1. 6, 7. and
appealings to God, 1 Samuel 14. 41. and therefore not to be used to wickedness,
Math. 27. 35. as South-saying, Ester 3. 7. or Covetousness, or any evil
practices, Prove. 1. 14.

Q. 72. What art thou commanded in the fourth Commandment, concerning the
Sabbath?
A. To keep it, to sanctify it, and so as the Lord has commanded, Deuteronomy. 5.
12, not to hide mine eyes from it, Ezec. 22. 26. not to turn my foot from it,
to delight in it, to count it honorable, to honor God in it, not seeking mine
own pleasure, not doing mine own works, nor speaking mine own words, Isa.
58. 13. To regard it in mine own dwelling house, and in Gods at public
Convocations and assemblies, Levit. 23. 3. there to Pray, Acts 16. 13. To have
the Word read and Preached, Acts. 15. 21. to reason about matters of Religion,
Acts 17. 2. To sing unto the Lord and thank him, Psalm. 92. 1. To meditate and
triumph in Gods works, verse. 4. To talk of Gods faithfulness, and show it
forth morning and night, verse. 2. It is not an hour or two at Church, and so
an end; but all the whole day; for it is not a part of a day, but a whole Day,
Math. 12. 1. If I will not hearken to hallow this day I shall burn in
Hellfire, for ever, Ier. 17. 27. He is an adversary to God, that mockes at a
strict keeping of a Sabbath, Lam. 1. 7. For God has blessed it, Genesis 2. 3. and
it is a Sign between a man and his God, Ezec. 20. 12.

Q. 73. What say you more of the Sabbath?
A. I must not only keep it, but keep it verily, Exodus 31. 13. and abstain
from all weekly works, not only rest but rest holily, verse. 15. Fathers must
not suffer, much less cause their Children, or Masters their Servants, or
Inne-keepers their Ghests, to break this day, Exodus 20. 10. none may buy or
sell victuals or wares on this day, Nehem. 13. 16, 17. nor carry burdens, Ier.
17. 22. Nor go journies, Exodus 16. 29. nor dress meat beyond necessity, or
godly convenience, to the hinderance of themselves, or Daughters, or Maids,
from sanctifying this day, verse. 23. Hither are referred holy Feasts or
thankesgivings, Neh. 8. 9, 10. As the deliverance from the Gunpowder Treason,
Hester 9. 21. Fasts for humiliations, 2 Chronicles. 20. 3. which must be Sanctified
too, Joel 1. 4. as being kinds of Sabboths, Levit. 16. 31. And therefore the
Convocations of them must be holy, Levit. 23. 24.

Q. 74. May no works but only of Gods immediate Worship be do^e on the
Sabbath?
A. Yea, first works of Mercy to a Beast in danger or need, Math. 12. 11. or
to Man in sickness, or other misery, verse. 10. whether in soul or body, Luke
13. 11. Secondly, works of necessity, as taking of food, Mark 2. 23. Thirdly,
works of decency, as making of beds, and the like; for the Sabbath was made for
Man, and not man for the Sabbath* verse. 27. Fourthly, works of common honesty
and humanity, as saluting one another, we are not forbidden to be courteous, 2
Pet. 3. 8. Fifthly, works though otherwise in themselves se^^ile, requisite to
Gods worship, as traveling to Church, Luke 6. 6. or riding diverse miles off to
the Prophets of God, if need be, 2 Kings 4. 22, 23. The Ministers studying his
text, and the Priests killing of the sacrifices, 2 Chronicles. 23. 31. and setting
things in order, Lev. 24. 8. If any call this profaning Gods Sabbath, he must
know it is blameless, Math. 12. 5. Sixthly, works of helpful refreshings, as
walking, for that may be existent with the immediate worship of God, Luke 6. 1.
I do not mean Playing, Exodus 32. 6. or recreations for our own Pleasure, for
they are forbidden, Isa. 58. 13.

Q. 75. There be many arguments to prove the Commandment of the Sabbath, to
be moral* which be the first six of them?
A. First, the Sabbath was delivered to Adam before the fall, when there was no
Ceremony, Genesis 2. 2. which is not spoken by anticipation, but the context
shows it was then sanctified to him, verse, 3. Secondly, Moses takes it for
granted, it was known to be moral, and known before the Law was given, Exodus
16. 25. Thirdly, unless this be moral there cannot be ten Commandments; for
the Duties being commanded in the three former the time only here, either this
time must be moral, or else there cannot be ten, which is false; Deuteronomy. 16. 4.
Fourthly, God would not put a cerimoniall law in the midst of the moralls,
and urge it with more words, reasons, repititions, and particulars, then any of
the moralls, as he does the Sabbath, Exodus 20. 8. 9, 10, 11. Fifthly, Christ
speaking of those days, when all the cerimoniall law was dead and buried,
shows the Sabbath stands still, Math. 24. 20. Sixthly, the Prophet prophesying
of the days of the Gospel, when Christ the righteousness and salvation of God
should be revealed. Isa. 56. 1. pronounces a blessing on them, in those times
that keep the Sabbath from poluting of it. verse. 2. and puts the keeping of
the Sabbath for the whole obedience of the covenant. ver. 6. which he would not
do if it were; for obedience is better them sacrifice or ce^imony. 1. Sam. 15.
22.

Q. 76. Now because some object, saying the Sabbath is not engraven in men's
hearts, neither is there any mention either before the flood, or after that the
fathers did keep it, and so forth, therefore tell me what arguements have you
to prove it moral?
A. First, if God had meant to out on Cerimony, among the Laws that were
moral, he would rather have put Sacrifice, for that is more a dequat to all
the ^^^imoniall saw. Hos. 6. 6. being a type of repentance. Psalm. 50. 17.
Thanks givings. Psalm. 107. 22. Prayer. Prove. 21. 27. Justice and Judgment.
ver. 3. all religion, Pro. 15. 8. a full type of Christ. Heb. 9. 14. Secondly,
the scripture shows not that nor Christ. Mat. 5. 17. nor the law of faith
does disanull any thing of the law, meaning directly the Decalogue. Romans 3. 31.
Thirdly the Sabbath was intimated in Caine and Ables Public serving of God.
Genesis 4. 3. 4. and in the public calling on Gods name in the days of Enosh,
ver. 26. and in Noah's waiting the fall of the waters by Sevens. Genesis 8. 10. 12.
who no question as he condemned the world by building the Ark on the week
days. Heb. 11. 7. So also by preaching o^ the Sabbath; for he was a Preacher.
2. Pet. 2. 5. and in Abraham too, who was a Prophet. Genesis 20. 7. and had a
great people to preach to. Genesis 14 14. Fourthly, the Sabbath is engraven upon
man's heart, of which the ingraving upon Tables was a token. Exodus 34. 28. and
to show the everlastingnesse of it, it was written which none of the Ceremonies
were, in stone. Deuteronomy. 4. 15. Fisthly, when God speaking of the covenant of
grace, he says, he will write it again in the minds of his redeemed. Heb. 10.
16. even upon the fleshly tables of their hearts, alluding to the material
writing. 2. Corin. 3. 3. Sixthly, the very heathens had their Sephtamins, their
eights, and the ninths, still hovering about the holy seventh of the Decalogue,
the whole law being obscurely written in their hearts. Romans* 2. 15.

Q. 77. The Sabbath was the last day of the Week, how comes it now to be
changed into the first day of the week?
A. This day the Lord has made, Psalm. 118. 24. For on this day Christ rose
from the dead, and rested from the work of Redemption, Math. 28. 1. Having
created new heavens and a new earth, Psalm. 65. 17. which we are to keep by
virtue of the fourth Commandment still; for Christ tells us, he is Lord of
it, Math. 12. 8. which is called sometimes from Priority of order and dignity,
the first day of the Week, Acts 20. 7. Sometimes from the Author that did
institute it, the Lords day, Rev. 1. 10. as we see the Lords Supper is so
called, 1 Cor. 11. ^0. And though the Sabbath from the Crcation were from Even
to even, Levit. 23. 32. Days being so reckoned, Genesis 1. 31. yet this Sabbath
is to be reckoned from Christ's Resurrection; and therefore is from Morning to
morning, Mark 16. 2. And albeit Mary Magdalen came while it was darkish, and
Christ was risen before that, and so might seem to have risen over night, Job.
20. 1. yet that could not be the women, and Peter, and John would never have
deferred their going to the Sepulcher, till morning then as they did verse. 2.
Now howsoever this Day be circumstantially changed and Ceremonies removed; yet
the day stands still moral, Acts 16. 13. The Commandment of not Killing, had
a ceremony a^next to it. as the eating of the Flesh, with the blood, Genesis 9. 4.
5. which now is changed. Col. 2. 21. and yet the Commandment of not killing
stands still, Romans 13. 9.

Q. 78. What art thou commanded in the fifth Commandment?
A. To honor my Father and Mother, Exodus 20. 12. to fear my mother and
father, Levit. 19. 3. to use reverent gestures before them, verse. 32 and
reverent speeches to them. 1 King. 2. 20 to obey them. Prove. 16. 20. in godly
choice of Marriage as Isaac did, Gen 24. 4, 67. and of Vocation, as Samuel did,
1 Samuel 1. 28. and 2. 11. and of suitable Apparel, verse. 19. yea in all things,
Cel. 3. 2. So it b^ in the Lord, Ephesians. 6. 1. To receive all godly instruction
from them, Prove. 1. 8. to submit to their correction Prove. 23. 13. to require
my Parents love, 1 Timothy 5. 4. to relieve them i^ they be in want, Genesis 47. 11.
to cover their Infirmities in a humble wise, Genesis 9. 23. To entreat Christ for
them. Mark. 1. 29, 30. 31. ^^ nothing to be unnatural toward them, 2 ^im ^ 2,
3. I must honor my Parents, not only by generation, Prove. 23. 22. but also by
ashnity. Ruth 3. 1, 5. by adoption, Ester 2. 7. 20. by in^^ and government, as
Kings and Magistrates, Isa 22. ^1. by bounty as benefactours, Ioh 29. 16. also
through Age as old men, 1 Timothy 5. 1. ^^. or through Spiritual profession, as
Ministers and Preachers, 1 Cor. 4. 15. for they are my spiritual Fathers, Tit.
1. 4. and these I must have in a double honor, 1 Timothy 5. 17.

Q. 79. But what must my Parents d^e for me?
A. They must pray to God for me, 1 Samuel 1. 10. and devote me unto God before
I am borne, verse. 11. bless God for me when I am borne, Luke 1. 68. and
provide all things necessary for me to this life and therefore much more for
Heaven. 1. Tim. 5. 8. to ^each men diligently the ways of the Lord. Deuteronomy. 6.
7. that I may be learned in the scriptures from a child. 2. Tim. 3. 15. and not
provoked to wrath, but brought up in the nurture of the Lord. Ephesians. 6. 4. to
offer continually the sacrifice of Prayer for me though I be a far of. Job.
1. 5. to set up the service of God in their house, that I may daily partake of
it. Josh. 24. 15. For cursed are such families that have not Prayers, and
invocation* upon God in them. Ier. 10. 25. to hold me to the observing of Gods
statutes, as for example the Sabbath. Exodus 20. 10.

Q. 80. What is the meaning of the sixth Commandment; Thou shall do no murder?
A. Thou shall not kill thy self. Act. 16. 27, 28. neither by distempering thy
self, as a drunkard does. 1. Sam. 25. 36. nor by neglecting the body. Col. 2.
23. nor by denying comforts to the body. 1. Tim. 5. 23. nor by too much grief.
Pro. 17. 22. Thou shall not kill another, whether he be a good man, Pro. 1. 11.
or a bad man. Genesis 4. 15. neither by devices. 2. Sam. 11. 15. nor by forgery 1.
King. 21. 13. nor by changing duels. 2. King. 14. 8. This commandment does not
only forbid murder in outward act, Genesis 9. 6. but also all reproachful words
and anger, Math. 5. 22. and all angry looks. Genesis 7. 6. and all hatred. 1.
Ioh. 3. 15. and all tale-bearing. Lev. 19. 16. I must blow away a talebearer,
as the North wind blows away rain. Pro. 25. 23. I must be careful to
maintain the life and health, and to recover my neighbor from sickness, not
only his daughter. Math. 15. 22. not only his son. Ioh. 4. 47. not only
his servant, Math. 8. 5. 6. but also a stranger, Luke 10. 34.

Q. 81. Is it not lawful to kill in any wise?
A. Yes. Deuteronomy. 13. 9. for the Magistrate may and must use the sword against
them that deserve it. Romans 13. 4. but then it must be done in humility. Iezabel
in her feined doing of justice, would have a fast when she put Naboth to death.
1. King. 21. 12. and with rendernesse of the malefactors soul, that I may
give glory to God. Josh. 7. 19 A Captain and his soldiers may kill the enemy
in a just battle. 1. Sam. 15. ^. nay, he is an offender if he will not. verse.
18* 19. but so as there be peace first offered, if they be fit to have it.
Deuteronomy. 20. 10. and also a private man in case of necessity, upon his own defense
or brothers. Exodus 2. 12.

Q. 82. What else does this Commandment urge?
A. Not to be soon angry. Tit. 1. 7. unless it be without sin. Ephesians. 4. 26.
and against sin. Mark. 3. 5. not to be hasty, Prove. 14. 26. to be long
suffering, 1 Cor. 13. 4. to overcome evil with goodness, Romans 12. 21. ready to
forgive. Ephesians. 4. 32. not to be suspicious, 1. Cor. 13. 5. but apt to believe
good of ones neighbor, verse. 7. to be courteous, 1. Pet. 3. 8. without envy,
Iam. 3. 14, without emulation and any evil, Math. 20. 12. or envious disdain,
Prove. 14. 30. or contempt, Prove. 18. 3. or uncompassionatenesse, 1. Ioh. 3. 17.
not to be a flattering friend, Proverb. 19. 4. nor treacherous, Luke 22. 4. nor
to bear a secret grudge. Prove. 26. 26.

Q. 83. What more does it Command?
A. To rejoice with them that rejoice, and weep with them that weep, Romans 12.
15. To resist the beginnings of strife, Prove. 17. 14. as loud speaking, Ephesians.
4. 31. or provoking inter^ections, as Pish, tush, Raka, Math. 5. 22. To depart
from ones own right to redeem love and peace, Genesis 13. 8, 9. 10. To be
hospitable, for thereby some have entertained Angels unawares, Heb. 13. 2. to
be without offense, Romans 14. 21. yea in a morsel of meat, verse. 15. For if we
offend the Conscience of our weak brethren we sin against Christ, 1 Cor. 8.
12.

Q. 84. What is the meaning of the seventh Commandment, Thou shall not commit
Adultery?
A. Thou shall not commit Sodomy, Romans 1. 27. no^ Bestiality, Lev. 18. 23. nor
Incest verse. 6. nor Whoredom, Levit. 20. 10. nor Fornication, Heb. 12. 16. nor
Poligamy, Mal. 2. 15. nor Rape, Deuteronomy. 22. 25. nor admit of unlawful Divorces,
Math. 19. 9: for l^st of Adultery, Math. 5. 22. Yet in case the wife has
committed Adultery, the bond is not broken if the Husband be pleased to
continue it, and renew it, 2 Samuel 3. 14. nor unreasonable absenting, but there
may be absenting upon necessity, 1 Samuel 25. 18. As a Soldier in time of war,
2 Samuel 11. 11. or when a lawful trade does enforce, as a Seafaring man; for
the men were named only to have sailed abroad, 1 King. 9. 27. Husband and wife
must not defraud one another, unless it be with consent for a time, for
fas^ing and Prayer, 1 Cor. 7. 5. or for some special work of God, Exodus 18.
2. they must not deny one another due benevolence, 1 Cor. 7. 3.

Q. 85. What say you of Marriage?
A. Marriage is honorable among all men, Ministers and all, Heb. 13. 4. Simply
considered, better then celebrated; because instituted before the fall of Man,
Genesis 2. 18. as since the fall it is a means to avoid Fornication, 1 Cor. 7. 2.
and temptation, verse. ^. and burning, verse. 9. yet to this or that man not to
be married, may be better, verse. ^. and a special gift, verse. 7. by reason of
circumstance and present distresses, verse. 26. For thereby one is more vacant
for the service of God, verse. 32. But Marriage in it self has neither
Commandment for it, nor against it, verse. 25. When a Son and Daughter are to
marry, their Fathers have power to strike up the marriage, Deuteronomy. 7. 3. between
such and such, Ier. 29. 26. namely, with the parties consent, for that it is
essential to Marriage, Genesis 24. 8. However the Father have a negative voice,
Genesis 28. 1. And though they have given their consent, he has power to break
it, Exodus 22. 17. Nay their vow cannot stand without his consent, either
express or implicit, Numb. 30. 5.

Q. 86. What say you of Contracts, or Espousals before consummaie Marriage?
A. They are not essentially required to Marriage for it may be all at once,
Genesis 2. 22. yet it is not amiss to go by degrees in Marriage, being a weighty
thing, and a Covenant of God, Prove. 2. 17. but when a couple are Contracted
only, they are Man and Wife, Deuteronomy. 22. 23, 24. Joseph and Mary, espoused only,
Math. 1^ 18. yet they were man and wife, verse. 20. as appears also by the
spiritual Espousals unto Christ, which are faithful, Hos. 2. 20. and stands
for ever, verse, 19. namely the Espousals being absolute, Luke 2. 5. yet if
they be conditionally, they may be broken when Marriage cannot, for Marriage no
creature can difanull, Mark. 10. 9. to wit. First, if there were a just
condition put, which is not fulfilled. Secondly, if a time were set, and the
one party fails, then the other is free. Thirdly, if there appears any thing
after the Espousals, which if it had been known before had hindered them; and
now one party reasonably change his mind. Fourthly, if both agree to loosen
the promise made but conditionally; promises of Marriage becomes often
scandalous, 1. Sam. 18. 17. and therefore better slay till through agreement,
for Marriage is the absolute taking of one to be a wife, Genesis 25. 1. Marriage
though it be more solemnly celebrated by a Minister, yet it may be also by the
civil Magistrate. Ruth. 4. 1. openly before witnesses, ver. 9. and with
invocation and benidiction verse. 11, 12. so then Marriage is consummate. verse.
13.

Q. 87. What is the duty of man and wife?
A. First, Conjugall love as toward their own bodies and souls, Ephesians. 5. 28.

them in Marriage they must solemnly bless them, and beseech the Lords blessing
upon them, verse. 60. The man must be careful that he Marry a godly daughter

here are condemned. First, Bankrupt Gentlemen, that will not labor in their

maintenance, Prove. 30. 8. Thirdly, To use comfortably the good gifts of God,
Eccl. 5. 10. so that nothing be lost for want of honest saving, John. 6. 12.
casting our care upon God, 1 Pet. 5. 7. to be sober in the using of, or caring

especially to the Saints, ^om. 12. 13.

Q. 92. What say you of men's particular Callings, for they come here to be
examined?
A. Every man and woman is to have a calling, Genesis 2. 15. and to do his own
business, ^ Thessalonians. 4. 11. though it be with much labor and s^^eat, Genesis 3.
^9. wherein he is to labor six days, Exodus 20. 9. except it be to go to a
Lecture, or to any other higher duty, Ioh. 4. 28. for idleness is a deep

conscience will afford, Prove. 28. 20. Sixthly, minding his own matters, 1 Pet.
4. 15. Seventhly, the grace of God to sanctify and establish his work, Psalm.
90. 17. a man must abide in his calling, wherein he is called, ^ Cor. 7. 20.
except it be a calling only for a time, as to be a servant; for then he may be
free, when God opens a door, ver. 21 otherwise not to leave it without a
special, warrant, Amos. 7. 15.

Q. 93. Now because the rich are the poores purse bearers and do steal from
them, if they be not merciful and bountiful to them, what say you of alms and
bounty?
A. 1, Every soul that has not a farthing to give yet in affection must, for
there is a liberal soul, Prove. 11. 13. Secondly, though a man be a poor
labourer, he must labor the harder that he may be able to give, Ephesians. 4. 28.
Thirdly, much more, if a man have this world goods somewhat more plentifully, 1
Ioh. 3. 17. Now this giving is not to burden a man, either in his necessaries
or conveniences to his estate and condition, 2 Cor. 8. 13. yet in case of
necessity of our poor brother, we must to our power and beyond our power give,
verse. 3. yea in our deep poverty to be liberal, verse: 2. to our decayed
brethren, Act. 20. 35. especially such as are nearest us, verse. 34. to all,
but most especially of all to the household of faith, Gal. 6. 10. not so much to
them that are wicked, yet charity will not judge easily evil of any, 1 Cor. 13.
5. and this our giving must be first, with aiming at the honoring of God,
Prove. 3. 9. Secondly, without letting our left hand know what our right does,
Math. 6. 3. Thirdly, without shaming of the poor, 1 Cor, 11. 22. Fourthly, out
of a charitable and a compassionate mind, 1 Cor. 13. 3. Fifthly, not
grudgingly but chearefully, 2 Cor. 9. 7. and bountiful, verse. 6. Sixthly,
according to the measure of Gods prospering of us, 1 Cor. 16. 2. where, and how
much, and what, and when, cannot be defeined, but by wisdom and righteousness
which teaches how to give, Psalm. 112. 9. Seventhly, we must consider that he
which takes pity on the poor lends to the Lord, and the which he has given,
will he pay him again, Proverb. 19. 17.

Q. 94. What is the meaning of the ninth Commandment, Thou shall not bear
false witness against thine neighbor?
A. That is, thou shall not lie, Levit. 19. 11. for lying is an abomination
unto the Lord, Prove. 12. 22. and shall never escape, Prove. 19. 9. but be
damned, Revel. 21. 8. whether it be with merry lies, Hos. 7. 3. or officious
lies, though it be to help ones self, Genesis 12. 13. neither may thou lie,
thinking to glorify God by it, Rev. 3. 7. or for God, though thy meaning be
never so good, Job. 13. 7. much less with pernicious lies, Prove. 6. 17. nor by
telling the truth with a feigned gesture or countenance, or pronuncation, or
unreasonabl, yas Doeg spoke truth, 1 Samuel 22. 9. yet he lied by speaking it,
Psalm. 52. 3. a deceitful tongue shall not be in thy mouth, Zeph. 3. 13. thou
shall nor fear to deny the truth, Math. 26. 70. nor slip away for fear of
standing to the truth, 2 Timothy 4. 16. Thou shall not give ear to Rumors, flying
reports, or a tale bearing lips, Prove. 17. 4. nor give credit, to such as
carry favor, as David to Ziba, 2 Samuel 16. 3, 4. nor interpret good things illu
1 Samuel 16. 13. nor judge rashly, least thou be judged, Math. 7. 1. unless
where thou know by the fruits thy judgment is right, verse. 20. and then
cursed art thou if thou call a wicked man an honest man, Isa. 5. 20. Thou shall
not speak true words intending a wrong sense, Math. 26. 60, 61. thou shall
utter the truth, when thy neighbor does need it, or God does command it, Act.
4. 20. and not betray the truth from thy neighbor, Ephesians. 4. 25. nor leave him
comfortless in the midst of lying reports, 1 Samuel 19. 4. though it be like
to cost thee thy life, 1 Samuel. 20. 32, 33.

Q. 95. Which be the Speeches that seem to be lies, and yet are not?
A. First, Ironicall speeches seem to be lies and yet are not, Math. 22. 12.
Secondly, Sarcasmes they are not lies neither, Genesis 3. 22. not speeches in
godly derision of wickedness, 1 Kin. 18. 27 nor Thirdly, Apologues and moral
fables though of matters that cannot be so, Judge. 9. 8. nor Fourthly,
Hyperboles though they let forth things seemingly more then they are, 1 Samuel 7.
6: nor yet, Fifthly, Figurative speeches though literally not true, Ioh. 15.
1. nor Sixthly, Speeches of confession though clean contrary to the down right
meaning of the speaker, 1 Kin. 22. 15. nor Seventhly, speeches of simple
desire, though the event be otherwise, Luke. 24. 28. nor Eighthly, threatening
though not effected, when the understood condition is supplied, Ion. 3. 4. nor
Ninthly, Promises not kept when the condition is broken, 1 King. 11. 38. nor
Tenthly, dictating Commandments, 1 Samuel 10. 8. though not obeyed, 1 Samuel 13. 8.

Q. 96. What lying reports go for current on the godly?
A. They are reproached and shamed, Psalm: 69. 7. and counted. First, strange
men yea even of their brethren, verse. 8. Secondly, zealous hot spurs, verse.
9. Thirdly, moping weepers, verse. 10. having Proverbs made on them, verse. 11.
Songs and Ballads lead on them too, verse. 12. being mowed and grind at, as
they go in the streets, Psalm. 35. 16. and winkt at with the eye, verse. 9. and
laughed at, verse. 21. Fourthly, Signs and wonders and monsters of men, Isa. 8.
18. Fifthly, fools, Isa. 35. 8. Sixthly, hipocrites, as if drunkards, and
whore-masters and Atheists, and prophanelings, were holyer then they, Isa. 65.
5. they are counted proud, and selfe-conceited, men that have naughtier hearts
then others, for all there few shows, as Eliah thought of David, 1 Samuel 17.
28. Seventhly, troublers, and seditious turbulent spirits, 1 King. 18. 17.
Sectures every where spoken against, Act. 28. 22. pestilent fellows, Act. 24.
5. irreguler men, enemies to the Law of the land, Act. 25. 8. men that care not
for Churches, Act. 24. 6. Sixthly, precise and strict men, and the world
wonders they will not do, as other men do, 1 Pet. 4. 4. Singular people and
certain fellows by themselves, Zach. 3. 8. Puritanes whom our Savior
prophetically blesses, though other do curse them, Mat. 5. 8. and you are one
of the Elect forsooth, thus folk mock them, for so was Christ handled, Luke 23.
35. and if they say they are persecuted and nicknamed for righteousness sake,
as they are, the world answers them as the Jews answered Christ, for a good
work we stone thee not, John. 10. 33. nay, the world thinks they do well to
revile them, like the Jews, say we not well thou art a Samaritan, and have a
Devil, John. 8. 48.

Q. 97. What pretenses have the Papists for their Equivocations and their
mental Reservations, and how are they answered?
A. First, Because our Savior says of the dead Damsel, she is not dead,
Matthew. 9. 24. but Christ spoke plainly, to the understanding of the standers
by, who though she was finally dead, as it appears by the Ministrels, verse.
23, Secondly, because he says he told his Disciples all things that he heard
of his father, John. 15. 15. whereas afterward, he confesses that he told them
all things, John. 16. 12. but he speaks distinctly in regard of his friendly
opennesse, John. 15. 14. Thirdly, because he says he was ignorant of the day
of Judgment, whereas indeed he was not, but he did not equivocate; for he
confesses he spoke this in regard of his manhood, Mark. 13. 32. Fourthly,
because he says he would not go up to the feast, and yet he did, John. 7. 10.
but the truth is, he did not say he would not go up unto the feast, but that he
would not yet, verse. 8. nevertheless in some case a man may reveal one part,
and conceal the other, Ier. 38. 27. Nay, though we probably know, some will
gather false inferences, Act, 23. 6, 3. but we must never lie to one another,
for that is a badge of the old man, Col. 3. 9. abomination unto God, Prove. 6.
17. and the brand of Dogs that are without Christ, Rev. 22. 15. and the Devil
is the father of it, John. 8. 44. and it is eleane contrary to saving grace,
which is called truth, Ioh. 1. 17. and to God himself, who is called the God
of truth* Psalm. ^1. 5.

Q. 98. Now for the tenth Commandment, before you speak of that; tell me what
is Original sin?
A. It is three fold. First, it is Adams actual disobedience, whose person
infected the nature, and nature infected, infects every person, insomuch as all
men thereby are made sinners, Romans 5. 19. For he sinning all men finned, verse.
12. all men were in Adam, 1 Cor. 15. 22. and Adam was not only that man, but
man, verse. 21. and all men were then potentially in his loins; as Levi was in
Abraham's when Melchisedech did meet him, Heb. 7. 10. and they all sinned in
Adam, as Levi paid tithes in Abraham, verse. 9. as they were all made upright
in Adam, so they all sought out many inventions in Adam; and look what Adam
did, they all would have done, if they had been in his room, Eccl. 7. 29.
being borne of him as the young Toade of the old one, or a young wild Ass colt
of the old one, Job. 11. 12. can the young Viper complain, that the old one
brought it forth a viper, and not a goodly Ox, Math. 3. 7. or can the fruit of
the Thistle complain that it was not a Fig? Math. 7. 16. No more can the
child complain of the father, that he brings him forth sinful; woe be to him
that says to his father, what begettest thou, Isa. 45. 10. Like must needs
beget like and after its own Image, Genesis 3. 5.

Q: 99. You said, that Original sin is threefold, and have told me the first
branch; which is Second?
A. A Naked privation of all original righteousness which every soul is
borne in, Hos. 2. 3. whereby there is no Spiritual goodness in any man by
nature, Romans 7. 18. no power so much as to think a good thought, 2 Cor. 3. 5.
no life of God, Ephesians. 4. 18. the mind all together in darkness, Ephesians. 5. 8.
desperately unable to comprehend any saving light though it shine on it, John.
1. 5. the conscience void of all Purity, Tit. 1. 15. and all true peace, Isa.
57. 21. and feeling, Ephesians. 4. 19. and sense, 1 Timothy 4. 2. the will unable to
make choice or to receive the things of Gods spirit, 1 Cor. 2. 14. and never
able to help it self, except the Lord work it, Phil. 2. 13. the whole man dead
in sin, Col. 2. 13. the affections out of order and vile, Romans 1. 26. and
unnatural? Tim.3. 3. the appetite unbridled from immoderate thirsting, Ier. 2.
25. and had need of a knife to be put to the throat. Prove. 23. 2. the senses
unspirituall, Jude. 19. and had need of a new covenant to be made with them,
Job. 31. 1. being heavy and dull to let in that which is good, Mat. 13. 15. the
outward members servant to the carnal heart, Romans 6. 19. a privation or right
to the Creatures, for Christ only is now the heir of them, Heb. 1. 2. and
those that are in Christ, 1 Cor. 3. 22. otherwise all the creatures groan in
man's hands, Romans 8. 22. Indeed wicked men may have a civil right before men to
the creatures; Nabal shared his sheep, 1 Samuel 25. 2. and must feed upon the
creatures, because they are forbidden to murder themselves, Exodus 20. 13.

Q. 100. Which is the third Branch?
A. A positive corruption of nature, 1 Cor. 15. 50. whereby the whole man is
not only fleshly out flesh it self. Ioh. 3. 6. it being a complete body of
sin, Romans 7. 24. consisting of all the members. verse. 23. the mind, an
enemy unto God, Romans 8. 7. desperately inclined by carnal reason, to devise
evil. Ier. 4. 22. the will selfe-willed, 3 Pet. 2. 10. the affections
invincibly set upon the things here on earth, Col. 3. 2. except Christ raise
(...) up again, verse. 1. the memory apt to forget spiritual things, 2 Pet.
1. 9. and to remember carnal, or carnally, Math. 27. 63. the Conscience
errecouerably evil, Heb. 10. 2. except Christ's eternal Spirit once purge it,
Heb. 9. 14. and therefore it is the nature of a man to be a child of wrath,
Ephesians. 2. 3. which is most constant And unalterable, and unpossible to be healed,
except the power of the Almighty change it and quicken it altogether with
Christ, verse. 5. Thus is every man conceived and born, nay David himself,
Psalm. 51. 5. and though he be baptized, and then presently die; yet if he were
not Baptized with Gods Spirit too, John. 3. 5. and borne again from above, he
could not be saved, verse. 3.

Q. 101. How is Original sin called in Scripture?
A. First, because this only is hereditary, its called absolutely sin, Romans
5. 12. Secondly, because it can never be gotten quite out in this life, it is
called the sin that dwells in us, Romans. 7. 17. Thirdly, because of its
wonderful fast hold it has gotten of our natures, it is called the sin that
hangs so fast on, or that so easily besets us, Heb. 12. 1. Fourthly, because it
has enthralled the whole man, and every faculty and members, it is called a
law in our members, Romans. 7. 23. Fifthly, because of its antiquity and
maturity, and experienced subtilty, it is called, the old man, Romans. 6. 6.
Sixthly, because it is ever hatching and conceiving of evil, and though a man
have never so much grace, yet it is ever lusting against it, it is called lust,
Iam. 1. 14. which will not let the godliest man under heaven do that good that
he would, Gal. 5. 17. Seventhly, because it is directly opposite to the spirit,
and all the graces of the spirit; it is called the flesh, Ephesians. 2. 3. and the
uncircumcision of the flesh, Col. 2. 13. and because a carnal man loves it as
dear as he does his heart blood, it is called blood too, 1 Cor. 15. 50, etc.

Q. 102. The Papists say, that it is not properly a sin, but after a manner;
the Pelagians say, there is no such sin, by progation, but only by imitation;
and the Anabaptists say, that now under Christ there is none borne in sin; How
do you prove then that there is such a sinful corruption of nature properly
so called?
A. First, David shows plainly, that sin was propagated to him, Psalm. 15. 5.
Secondly, Eliphaz shows that sin is now as natural to a man as water to a
fish, Job. 15. 16. Thirdly, Job shows it is such a woeful corruption that no
creature can ever purge it out, Job. 14. 14. Fourthly, Moses shows that there
is such an infinite deprivation in man's nature, that all that flows from it,
though it seem never so holy, and godly, and religious, yet it is only evil
and continually evil, Genesis 6. 5. Fifthly, Paul shows that man's nature is so
truly corrupted, that there is nothing in it, but it is the object of Gods
wrath, Ephesians. 2. 3. Lastly, it is such a doleful contagion, that the dearest of
Gods Saints, whenever they look on it, they are feign to cry out! O wretched
man that I am, Romans 7. 24, and this Original sin remains still after
Baptisie, the Saints at Rome were baptized, Romans 6. 3. and yet it was in them,
only they were to look to it, that it might not reign in them, verse. 12. and
if a soul be under grace, he is not freed from the inexistency of it, and the
continual assaults of it, but only from the Dominimon of it, verse. 14. and
because its a fountain ever running a fresh, we must every day sue out a new
pardon, Math. 6. 11. and ever go to the fresh fountain to be washed a new,
Zach. 23. 1.

Q. 103. What does this Doctrine or Original sin teach us?
A. First, to begin our humiliation here, thou were a transgressor from the
womb, Isa. 48. 8. Secondly, not to trust any of our faculties, David, would
not trust his mouth, without a bridle, Psalm. 39. 1. he would have no wicked
thing in house, or before his eyes, Psalm. 101. 7. Joseph would not trust
himself with the hearing of, or being with his Mistress, Genesis 39. 10.
Thirdly, to keep our heart with all diligence, Prove. 4. 23. and to bind the Law
of God about our heart, Prove. 6. 21. nay. Fourthly, not to trust any grace that
we have received already, nor to count our selves to have apprehended enough,
but still to press forwards, Phil. 3. 12. Fifthly, to be still laying aside
more and more of this weight. Hos. 12. 1. and to be still warring against it
for it still wars against us, 1 Pet. 2. 11. for first, this sin is an enemy
ever present with us, nay even when we are doing the best good, Romans 7. 21.
Secondly, because our heart is worse by reason of this sin, Hazael could not
believe what a vile heart he had, 2 King. 8. 13. no nor Peter neither, Math.
26. 33. Thirdly, because its a madness in the heart, there is no trusting of a
mad man, Eccel. 19. 3. Suppose we stand for the present and another fall, as we
must restore him, so we must consider our selves, it may be our case be we
never so spiritual, Gal. 6. 1.

Q. 104. What does the last Commandment command and forbid?
A. It commands the inward parts, Psalm. 51. 6. to be incorrupt in the hid man
of the heart, 1 Pet. 3. 4. it forbids all inward lust, Romans 7. 7. and all first
motions of sin, verse. 5. even before the consent and allowance of the evil,
verse. 15. and all lustings after evil, 1 Cor. 10. 6. or after the good
creatures of God in a carnal manner, Number. 11. 4. and all the squint-eyed
lookings of the heart, 1 ^ohu. 2. 1. for the very lusts are, First, ungodly,
Jude. 18. Secondly, they are foolish and hurtful, and they may drown men in
perdition, 1 Timothy 6. 9. Thirdly, they are deceiveable, Ephesians. 4. 24. Fourthly,
worldly, Tit. 2. 12. Fifthly, they are of the Devil, Ioh 8. 8, 44. Sixthly, they
are the very choakers of grace, Mark. 4. 19. Seventhly, they are the first
wheels of a sinful conversation, Ephesians. 2. 3. the first temptings and tidings
of sin, Iam. 1. 14. and the first itchings of sin, 2 Timothy 4. 3. and the first
that makes the soul a servant to sin, Tit. 3. 3. and they flow immediately
from Original concupisence, 1 Thessalonians. 4. 5. and if we do not crucify them, it
is a sign we are not Christ's, Gal. 5. 24. and if we do not escape them better
then the world does, we cannot be partakers of the Divine nature, 2 Pet. 1. 4.

Of Thoughts.
Q. 105. Now because the Thoughts are the beginnings of actions, and all sins
begin there. For where as St. John said, Think not to say with your selves,
as Matthew has it, Math. 3. 9 Saint ^^ke has it thus, Begin not to say within
your selves, Luke. 3. 8. therefore what say you of the Thoughts?
A. Sin when it is but begun in the thoughts is already a sin, Prove. 24. 9.
as soon is ever thoughts peeps up in the heart, Deuteronomy. 15. 9. nay it is not
only a sin, but it is abomination, Prove. 15. 26. and if it lodge in the
heart it hinders Salvation, Jer. 4. 14. and a man never repents, till he have
forsaken his thoughts, as well as his outward ill courses, Isa. 55. 7. never
can he be forgiven, except repentance root them out, Act. 8. 22. and therefore
we must labor to prevent their very risings in our hearts, Luke. 24. 38. not
only thoughts, that proceed out of our own heart, Math. 15. 19. but also
those that the Devil puts into our hearts, John. 13. 2. especially if they
never so little close with our heart, and prove to be our thoughts, though but
for a moment, Luke. 9. 47. which they will do for certain, either little or
much; for our heart is like tinder, and if any spark do fall in, it will
kindle, Psalm. 39. 3. yea even blasphemous thoughts though the heart seem to
hate them, Mark. 7. 21. and indeed do beat them down, Psalm. 73. 15. yet the
heart will think them hastily though in a moment, by reason of grace either
proper or common does unthink them again, Psalm. 116. 11.

Q. 106. But how if a soul be haunted with evil thoughts, and the more it
striveth against them, the more it is haunted, how then?
A. First, lay thy hand upon thy mouth, and be humbled for the wretchedness of
thy thoughts, Prove. 30. 32. Secondly, run to Christ Jesus for his grace and
comfort against them, Psalm. 94. 19. Thirdly, reason these thoughts out of thy
heart, saying why should I think them, Job. 31. 1. Fourthly, if they haunt
thee still go to thy calling, and do not stand poring on them, thoughts most
haunt a soul that is idle and at ease, Job. 12. 5. Fifthly, be sure thou hate
thine evil thoughts and be not dismayed, Psalm. 119. 113. Sixthly, understand
it is the Devils doing to make thee faint in the way; for he is in a rage,
seeing his time is but short, Reve. 12. 12. Seventhly, know thou the Lords
meaning herein, it is tolet thee see, thou have not so good a heart as thou
did imagine, for the heart is desperately wicked, Ier. 17. 1. it is not safe
to lay all the blame on the Devil, and fallely to accuse him, though he do
falsely accuse thee, Revel. 12. 10. though there were no Devil, the heart is
bad enough to be guilty of such haunting thoughts, Genesis 6. 5.

Q. 107. Is the Law of God so perfect, that it commands whatsoever can be said
to be good, and pleasing unto God, and, is there no room for Popish
supererogation or the Doctrine of distinguishing of Evangelicall counsels from
Precepts?
A. Gods Law is so broad, that it contains all the latitude of good, and of
its perfection there is no end, Psalm. 119. 96. it implies a contradiction, that
we should perform obedience to God in a thing that he has not commanded,
Deuteronomy. 12. 32. he that says he adds over and beyond the word of God, is a
liar, Prove. 30. 6. and therefore there can be no supererogation. First, because
the word commands whatsoever is true, honest, just, pure, lovely, or good, no
good, beyond a whatsoever* Phil. 4. 8. Secondly, because it requires all the
soul, and all the heart, and all the mind, and all the strength, what can be
beyond all, Luke. 10. 27. Thirdly, because no man is able to do as much as the
Law does command; and therefore much less can any do more, it makes the best
Saint daily to cry out, forgive us our trespasses, Math. 6. 12. there is not one
just man upon earth, but falls short of doing the good he is commanded, Eccl. 7.
20. Fourthly, Suppose men should command any thing beyond, the Lord tells them
flatly they Evacuate his law, Math. 15. 9. if their heart and wit do devise
any commandment it is against the Commandment of God* Numb. 15. 39. yea
though it be never so highly esteemed in the judgment of man, Luke. 16. 15.

Q. 108. But particulars Circumstances are not in the word, here, and now, and
he, and this, and that case; It should seem then where the word leaves, there
counsel may go on?
A. Commandments are of two sorts. First, Some are directed to all the people
in the world, Psalm. 49. 1. as the moral law, Gal. 3. 10. Secondly, Some are
directed to some particular men, either expressly, Math. 19. 21. or
implicitly and mediately, if such and such circumstances be, as to this or
that m^n not to Marry, 1 Cor. 7. 26. though there be no immediate Commandment
for a thing to bind me or thee, verse, 6. yet when here, and now, and thus, and
in such a case, and other such circumstances come between, it may prove a
moral Commandment, verse. 9. and if I would know, whether it be Gods will
that I should do this or that thing, yea, or no, Zach. 7. 3. I may know it by a
syllogism, Math. 12. 3. the Proposition in general being to be sought for in
scripture, Look what is written, Luke. 10. 26. the Assumption is to be sought
for out of circumstances, and out of this or that man's particular case, Math.
19. 10. and so the conclusion, in respect, of this or that man, at such a time,
or in such a place, or in such a case, comes to bind in conscience; like as if
it were an express moral Precept, verse. 11. As for example, these are
scripture rules, every one must labor to give no offense, 1 Cor. 10. 32. every
one must take a way that is most for Gods glory, verse. 31. and for the
promoting of the Gospel rather then there own profit, verse. 33. now Paul, all
circumstances being considered, did assume thus; if I Preach the Gospel without
hyre, I shall cut off offenses, 2 Cor. 11. 12. I shall promote the Gospel the
better, 1 Cor. 9. 23. and I shall more edify the Church, verse. 19. hence he
concluded, I Paul must preach without hire, verse. 15. this one thing rightly
considered confounds the Doctrine of Papists about Evangelicall counsels,
verse. 25.

Q. 109. Why are not Believers under the Law?
A. First, Because Christ was made under the law for them, Gal. 4. 4. Secondly,
because as many as are under the curse, Gal. 3. 10. Thirdly, because they are
led by the spirit of Christ, Gal. 5. 18. Fourthly, because they have the
inheritance by promise, Gal. 3. 18. and it may be known who they be, that are
not under the law; First, by there subjection to the Gosple, for they that obey
not the Gospel of God are all under the law and the curse, 2 Thessalonians. 1. 8.
Secondly, by thankful walking worthy of the Gospel, Romans 7. 25. and by
steadfast working the Lords work, 1 Cor. 15. 58. Thirdly, by being a law to
themselves, in an universal respect to all Gods Commandemenss, Psalm. 119. 6.
Fourthly, by groaning and sighing after God, that they may more and more be
directed and ordered by his statutes, verse. 5. Fifthly, by doing all this, out
of love, not for fear of hell and judgment, for they are a willing people,
Psalm. 110. 4.

Q. 110. In what sense are not believers under the Law?
A. First, They are not under the Law, in regard of the rigor of it, for that
requires men to be without linne, which none can be in this life, 1 King. 8.
46. and to perform personal obedience, which now is impossible by reason of
the weakness of the flesh, Romans 8. 3. Secondly, they are not under the law in
regard of justification, Romans 3. 20. they are freed from the necessary seeking
of righteousness by it, Gal. 2. 21. Thirdly, they are not under the ^aw, in
regard of the curse of it, Gal. 3. ^3. the Law ministers death, 2 Cor. 3. 7.
Fourthly, they are not under the Law, in regard of the spirit of fear, that is
in it, 2 Timothy 1. 7. which accompanyes the law, as it did the deliverer of it,
Heb. 12. 21. and yet as long as their love is not perfect they do fear, 1
John. 4. 18. Fifthly, they are not under the law, as it was in Moses his hand,
John. 1. 17. having a yoke of bondage annexed to it, Gal. 5. 1. the Church
being then in their minority, Gal. 4. 3. under tutors and governors, verse. 2.

Q. 111. Now prove that believers in some sense are under the Law?
A. First, Paul, says the Law is not abrogated by faith, nay God forbid says
he, Romans 3. 31. Secondly, the duties of the law are expressed upon the
conscience after faith, avenge not your selves, Romans 12. 19. children obey your
Patents, Ephesians. 6. 1. and the rest, neither is he a legal teacher, but an
Evangelicall teacher, that now presses the commandment of the Law upon the
conscience, Math. 15. 19. Thirdly, because it is a presumptuous speech to say,
be in Christ and sin if thou can^t, for David's murder after he was in Christ
was a finne, 2 Samuel 12. 13. there is not a justified man upon earth but
sins, Eccl. 7. 20. nay we, that are Apostles of Christ in many things we
offend all, says James, Iam. 3. 2. and if we say no we lie, 1 John. 1. 8. now
where no law is there can be no sin, Romans 4. 15. Fourthly, Christ came not to
abrogate the law, Math. 5. 17. as he fulfilled it himself, so he makes his
members to delight in it, Romans 7. 22. and to love it, Psalm. 119. 97. and the
law is said to be fulfilled by them, when they walk not after the flesh, but
after the spirit, Romans 8. 4. and if they sin at any time, they are commanded to
confess their sins, 1 John. 1. 9. and though they obey God out of love, yet
when they love, they fulfill the law of God, Romans 13. 10.

Q. 112. What is that sense, wherein believers are under the Law?
A. They are under the Law. First, in regard they are commanded to keep it
Psalm. 105. 45. and to order their lives according to it, as a rule, Psalm. 119.
9. Secondly, in regard of the necessity of good works not as causes of, but as
a way unto life, Tit. 3. 14. Thirdly, in regard that God is displeased with
them, when they break it, 2 Samuel 11. 27. and will punish them, Amos. 3. 2. as
a father does his son that does offend him, Heb. 12. 7. nay sometimes with the
sleep of temporal death, Cor. 11. 30. Fourthly, in regard that they are bound
to repent whenever they sin, Revel. 3. 19. and to pray for pardon of sin,
Psalm. 51. 1. Fifthly, in regard that the threatenings of the Law must be a motive
to them to take heed, Job. 31. 23. for though their God be a loving and an
everlasting father, yet he is a consuming fire, Heb. 12. 29. for though
unbelievers only shall be damned, 2 Thessalonians. 2. 12. yet believers must hear of
Gods judgments and see them, that their flesh may be ^^rbed with fear, Psalm.
52. 6. Sixthly, in regard that they are to be humbled themselves by the Law,
and cry out upon themselves for their often transgressings of it, Romans 7. 24.

Q. 113. What it Prayer?
A. It is a calling upon God, Romans 10. 13. in the name of Jesus Christ, Ioh.
16. 23. for whatsoever we need, John. 14. 13. it is an act of our spirit, 1
Cor. 14. 14. and of our heart prepared, Psalm. 10. 17. and of all the soul
lifting it self up unto God, Psalm. 25. 1. and looking up to him, Psalm. 5. 3.
and presenting our selves before him, Dan. 9. 20. with faith, Iam. 1. 6. and
earnestness, Act. 12. 5. and striving, Col. 4. 12. and great heed, Mark. 13.
33. by the help of the holy Ghost, Jude. 20. who is the spirit of Prayer in
Gods children, Zach. 12. 10. without whom, there is no sense, nor meaning in
our prayer in Gods account, Romans 8. 27. neither can we truly call God father
without him, Gal. 4. 6. neither are our prayers, prayers at all, except we be
Saints, the prayers of the Saints, Rev. 5. 8.

Q. 114. To whom are we to Pray?
A. To God only, it is his glory to be called upon, Psalm. 50. 15. which he will
not give to another, Isa. 42. 8. First, because prayer is a principal part of
divine worship, Ioal. 2. 32. and divine worship is to be given to God only, 1 Samuel 7. 3: Secondly, because we may call upon none, but one whom we are to
believe, Romans 10. 14. Thirdly, because God only knows our hearts, and what
we inwardly desire, Act. 1. 24. Fourthly, because he only is all-sufficient
and Almighty, Genesis 17. 1. to give us whatsoever we ask, 1 John. 5. 15.
warrantably, verse. 14. Fifthly, because the Lord counts it a heavy judgment,
when he lets people call upon any other but him, Judge. 10. 14. Sixthly, we have
neither precept nor example of any Saint that called upon any, but his heavenly
father, nay our Savior says, when ye pray, pray to your heavenly father,
Math. 6. 9. Seventhly, because we need nor Saint, nor Angel to enterceed for
us, we may make bold our selves with the throne of grace, Heb. 4. 16. Lastly,
Christ knocks of all need of Mediators with an argument of Gods infinite
condiscending love. John. 16. 26.

Q. 115. Why must we Pray in the name of Christ the mediator?
A. First, because we are poor sinful dust and ashes, and therefore we cannot
be admitted except he procure us access unto the father, Ephesians. 2. 18. Secondly,
because, we have provoked God, and therefore should pull down a curse rather
then a blessing, except he should make intercession for us, Romans 8. 34.
Thirdly, because he only is enough powerful with God, Math. 28. 19. and no
man is acquainted with God, but he, and such as he makes to be acquainted with
him, Math. 11. 27. again there is none worthy but he, for he was flame for us;
Revel. 5. 9. Fourthly, what are Moses, and Samuel, and Job, and Daniel, and
Noah, that we should ask in their name? to which of the Saints can we turn.
Job. 5. ^. Fifthly, all the Saints that were in the old Testiment, or since,
prayed in his name, David looked at him as his surety, Psalm. 119. 122. and his
Messiah or anointed, Psalm. 84. 9. Hezekiah looked at him as his undertaker, Isa.
38. 14. Daniel prayed God to hear him for his sake, Daniel. 9. 17.

Q. 116. What is it to Pray in the name of Christ?
A. It is not. First, to use Christ's name, and say, Lord we pray in Christ's
name, Math. 7. 22. nor Secondly, only to conclude our prayers thus, Through
Jesus Christ our Lord, though the Saints do use these words too, 1 Cor. 15.
57. nor Thirdly, to counterfeit Christ's Ring to the father, and say we come
from him; for the Lord knows who are his, and whether we truly come from him
yea, or no, 2 Timothy 2. 19. for Christ will say to his father, father I never
sent such and such, as he did of the false Prophets, I never sent them, Ier.
14. 14. but to pray in the name of Christ is. First, when we are in with
Christ, and so pray, John. 15 7. as the Tyr^a^^ first made Blastus the Kings
Chamberlain their friend and then made their suite to the King, Act. 12. 20.
Secondly, when we can truly says not only that there is an Advocate with their
father, but also that we have him for our advocate, 1 Ioh. 2. 1. Thirdly, when
we do not only conceit that we come to God by him* but we come to God by him
indeed, Heb. 7. 25. Fourthly, when we can truly show his Ring, that he is our
Mediator, by promise, Heb. 8 6. now this Ring is, First, effectual calling,
Heb. 9. 15. Secondly, a good conscience, when our heart condemn us not, then
we may be confident, 1 John. 3. 11. Thirdly, faith, Math. 21. 22. Fourthly, the
saving knowledge of the truth, 1 Timothy 2. 4. for then we may be sure we have a
token from the Mediator, verse. 5.

Q. 117. Why is Faith necessary to prayer?
A. It is necessary to bring us to prayer. First, because we cannot draw near
unto God else, Heb. 10. 22. Secondly, because the relation of God as a father,
must bring us unto prayer, Luke 15. 18. Thirdly, because the sense of our wants
and sins and afflictions are to fetch us unto prayer, Psalm. 116. 10.
Fourthly, because faith is the feet whereby to come unto God, Heb. 11. 6.
again faith is necessary to discharge prayer, ^am. 5. 15. First to pray
boldly, Ephesians. 3. 12. Secondly, to lift up hands that are holy, 1 Timothy 12. 8.
Thirdly, to enlarge thy heart in prayer, 1 Samuel ^. 1. again, faith is
necessary to conclude prayer, how else can we say Amen? Revel. 22. 21. or leave
our prayers with Christ, in whom the promises of God are yea and Amen, 2 Cor.
1. ^0. First, because faith must set thy heart at quiet after prayer; when
Hannah had done praying, she did eat and her countenance was no more sad, 1
Samuel, 1. 18. though there were but an inch between David and death, yet when
he had prayed, he set his heart at rest, ^ Psalm. 3. 5. Secondly, faith makes
the soul wait, and when we have prayed and used all the means, we have need
of patience to wait, Hebrew. 10. 36. Thirdly, faith inhanceth prayer the next
time, that if it speed no^ the first time, it may rise higher and higher with
all importunity, Luke. 11 8.

Q. 118. What say you of the differences and divisions of Prayer?
A. Prayer is either. First, Metricall with Music, Acts. 16. which is a duty
commanded, Psalm. 95. 1. being very suitable, to spiritual mirth, Jam. 5. 13.
and to make us heavenly minded; and therefore profitable every day, 1 Chronicles.
16. 23. it is good to make meditation sweet, Psalm. 104. 33, 34. and to stir
up affection, and to put glory upon Gods praises, Psalm. 66. 2. good also to
stir up the spirit of Prophecy, or of Prayer, 2 King. 3. 15. its a duty that
requires much grace, Col. 3. 16. and great understanding, Psalm. 47. 7. and
spirit, 1 Cor. 14. 15. and great modesty and gravity, it being melody to the
Lord, Ephesians. 5. 19. the heart not being upon the tune, but fixed upon the sense
and upon God, Psalm. 57. 7. not as though we did sing to one another, but unto
the Lord, Psalm. 13. 6. that we may not only sing David's Psalms, but that we may
be sweet singers of the^, as he was, 2 Samuel 23. 1. or Secondly, Prosaycall
which is either public prayer in the Congregation, Psalm. 7. 7. or private in
the family 1 Pet. 3. 7. or secret alone, Math. 6. 6. and all are either
ordinary prayer, which is every day, Psalm. 145. 2. or extraordinary as at a
fast, Jonas. 3. 8.

Q. 119. What say you of Public prayer?
A. The Minister is to perform it, and that with an audible voice, Nehem. 9.
4. in the public Sanctuary, Psalm. 150. 1. which may be in any place now, Mal.
1. 11. all the congregation. First, joining with him, with one consent, Zeph.
3. 9. as though they were all one man, Judge. 20. 1, 8. Secondly, testifying
this their consent by saying Amen, 1 Cor. 14. 16. Amen, Amen, Neh. 8. 6.
Thirdly, all praying the same prayer, with as much uniformity of thoughts and
affections, as can be, that it may make all one sound in Gods ^^re, 2. Chron.
5. 13. though the persons praying be many, yet the act must be as if it were
one act, Luke. 1. 10. and this public prayer is necessary. First, because
when it is public, it is the more glorious, Psalm. 96. 9. because men are
sociable creatures, and therefore as they love to live together, and trade
together, so they should praise God together, Psalm. 111. 1, 3. its fit to
stir up one another. O praise the Lord with me, Psalm. 34. 3. Fourthly, the
Lord is the likelyer to pity, when there be many, Ion. 4. 11. Fifthly, there be
many public ordinances of God, which all have need to be sanctified by
Prayer; there is the administration of the Sacrament, and that requires prayer,
Act. 2^. 16. and the Word, and that requires prayer, and the censures, and they
require prayer; and therefore Gods house, is called a house of Prayer, Math.
12. 13.

Q. 120. What more of public Prayer?
A. Public prayer is harder then private, though Gods people do more joy in
it then in private, Psalm. 122. 1. for in public a man is more subject. First,
to distraction, what with onething or another, it should seem Eutichus was
distracted with the swe^^inesse of the throng, and made drowzy, Act. 20. 9.
Secondly, Hypocrisy, hypocrisy made the Pharisees willing to pray in their
Synagogues, Math. 6. 5. Thirdly, to formalitie, Math. 15. 8. means to help
these evils are, First, pray often in secret, learn to pray there, and then
thou may the better pray in secret; learn to pray there, and then thou
may the better pray in public; David bidding us praise God in the
congregation, Psalm. 149. 1. he bids us praise God in our beds, verse. 9.
Secondly, prepare thy self and fix thy heart. First, and then come and pray
in public, Psalm. 57. 7, 8, 9. I will prepare bullocks and Goats, says the
Psalmist, Psalm. 66. 15. Thirdly, labor that the spirit of God may bring thee
into Gods Temple, Luke. 2. 27.

Q. 121. How do you prove, that the master of the family is to gather his
family together every morning and evening, and to pray in his family?
A. First, Because this is made to be one of the reasons why husbands should
dwell with their wives, that their domestical prayers be not hindered, 1 Pet.
3. 7. Secondly, by the example of Joshua, Josh. 24. 15. and Cornelius, Act. 10.
2. and Hester, Hest. 4. 16. Thirdly, because the families of the godly are
called Churches, Romans 16. 5. and therefore they should be as the Temple, where
morning and evening sacrifice was every day, and it was counted the abomination
of desolation, when it was taken away, Dan. 11. 13. Fourthly, because there is
a promise to encourage men to it, though but two, or three be in the family,
Math. 18. 20. Fifthly, because there be family sins, and family wants, and
familyblessings, all which require prayer; and therefore all families should
have sacrifices in them, 1 Samuel 20. 26, Sixthly, because the Lord curses such
families as do not, call upon his name, Ier. 10. 25. there is scripture enough
to prove it, though we might say of family prayer, as Paul does to the godly
concerning love, touching brotherly love, ye have not need that I write unto
you, for ye your selves are taught of God, to love one another, 1 Thessalonians. 4. 9.
so God taught Jacob to set up his worship in his household. Genesis 35. 2. and so
did Abraham, Genesis 18. 19.

Q. 122. What say you of extraordinary prayer.
Three things make it. First, extraordinary might and fervency. Ion. 3. 8.
Secondly extraordinary continuance, Hest. 4. 16. Thirdly, extraordinary
assistance of the spirit, and strength of the new nature, Math. 9. 17. Five
things do require it more especial. First, a special want of some blessing,
Luke. 2. 37. though the blessing be but temporal, Genesis 25. 21. Secondly,
entering upon a calling, Math. 4. 2, 17. Thirdly, ones, First, conversion, 2 Chronicles. 33. 13, 18, 19. Fourthly, some Imminent danger through sin, Math. 26.
75. Fifthly, when we see that ordinary prayer will not serve turn, 2 Cor. 12.
8. now fasting does help it, Act. 10. 30. for fasting. First, it pulls down
the flesh and chastens the soul, Psalm. 69, 10. and afflicts it, Ezra. 8. 21.
Secondly, its a good help to contrition, when its sanctified Joel. 1. 14.
Thirdly, being rightly observed, its a sign of humiliation, Nehem. 1. 4.
again extraordinary prayer. First, it requires resolutions of better
obedience, Hos. 14. 2, 3. Secondly, much humiliation contrary to pride, Job.
35. 12. Thirdly, freedom from worldly cares, that we may be given unto prayer,
Psalm. 109. 4. Fourthly, watchfulness and great heed taking, Mark. 13. 33.
Fifthly that we loose not o^^ quickings afterward, lest we be guilty of holding
down our heads like a bul-rush for a day, Isa. 58. 5.

Q. 123. What motives are there to induce us to extradinary prayer and seeking
of God?
A. There be six motives, First, the Commandment of God when ordinary seeking
will not find him, now he tells us is a time for extrordinary, Joel. 2. 12.
Secondly, the gracious promise that God has made to it, Math. 7. 7. Thirdly,
the great efficacy of it, Iam. 5. 16. for importunity can do much, Luke. 18.
5. the Israelites prayed often and sped not, but when they cried then they
sped, Exodus. 3. 7. So again when they crved to God, they did speed, Judge. 3.
15. this poor man cried, says David poynting at himself and the Lord heard
him, Psalm. 34, 6. Fourthly, the glory of God, and the credit of the Gospel; for
what may the world think, if we that stand so much for praying should not
prevail, Ezra. 8. 22, 23. Fifthly our infinite need, and therefore we should
think it is high time to awaken, and to call upon our hearts to awake, Psalm.
108. 2. Sixthly, our last refuge is extraordinary seeking, we must reason thus;
What hope have we, if we do not speed with God, Psalm, 39. 7.

Q. 124. May we not pray for the Dead?
A. No, David ceased praying for his child when once it was dead, 2 Samuel 12.
23. as for that place in the Machabes, Mac^ha. 12. 44. that is not Canonical
scriptures, 2 Ma^cha. 15. 38. First, when people are dead our communion with
them cease, Isa. 8. 19. Secondly there is no profit in such prayers, as the
tree falls, so it lies, Eccl. 11. 3. when our Savior says, that the sin
against the holy Ghost shall not be forgiven, neither in this world nor in the
world to come, Math. 12. 32. he does not imply that there may be some sins,
that though they be not forgiven in this world, yet they be forgiven in the
world to come, but it is only a vehement phrase to show it shall never be
forgiven, verse. 31. for we must agree with our adversary, while we ar^ here in
the way with him, Math. 5. 25. and yet we may pray for the consummation of such
as are dead in the Lord, for that is included in the second Petition, thy
kingdom come, Math. 6. 10. and they without us cannot be made perfect, Heb.
11. 40. again we may give thanks for the glorious victory of the Saints
departed, for if one member be perferred to honor, all the memb^^^ rejoice
with it, 2 Cor. 12. 26.

Q. 125. Now there be five sorts of the li^ing that we must Pray for. First,
for the whole Church of Christ. Secondly, for the Ministers. Thir^^^, for them
of our own house. Fourthly, for them ^, the place where we live. Fifthly, for
our enemy ^^ show me now whether and why we must pray ^^^ ^^^ whole Church of
Christ?
A. We must pray for all Saints, whether Saints actually already, or elect
which shall be Saints, Ephesians. 6. 18. for these Saints make up the Church, 1 Cor.
14. 33. for, First, they are the dearly beloved of Gods soul, Ier. 12. ^ God^
pleasant portion, verse. 10. The city of the living God, Heb. 12. 2^. the Lambs
bride, Reve. 2^. 9. Secondly, we are most bound to the Church, for the Church
is our mother, Gal. 4. 26. and therefore we should prefer her before all
Psalm. 137. 6. Thirdly, we shall prosper the better if we do, Psalm. 122. 6.
Fourthly, we shall the sooner, be heard for our selves, David when he would
seine be heard for himself, he prayed for the Church, Psalm. 51. 18. yea all
blessings, that come to us, come to us through the Church, Psalm. 133. 3.
Again, if the Church be in misery, good reason we should lament for her.
Nehem. 1. 4. for first, our sins have in part pulled down that misery upon
her, Nehem. 1. 6. Secondly, her miseries are ours, look what evil come upon
her comes upon us. Dan. 9. 13. Thirdly, it is the brand of the wicked not to
regard the afflictions of Joseph, Amos. 6. 6.

Q. 126. What and why must we pray for Gods Ministers?
A. That they may be clothed with righteousness, Psalm. 132. 9. and take heed
to their Ministry to fulfill it, Col. 4. 17. which is, First, not to preach
themselves, but Jesus Christ, 2 Cor. 4. 5. Secondly, to speak, and exhort, and
rebuke withal authority. Tit. 2. 15. in season, out of season, with all
instance and long suffering, 2 Timothy 4. 2. Thirdly, not to look back from the
plough lest they be unfit for Gods kingdom, Luke. 9. 62. Fourthly, to be an
example to believers, in word, in conversation, in spirit, and in purity, 1 Timothy 4. 12. again, we must pray that they may have utterance with boldness,
Ephesians. 6. 19. for First, we cannot look to have a good Minister, except we pray
for him, Math. 9. 38. Secondly, though we have one we cannot look to keep him,
except we pray for him, Act. 12. 5. Thirdly, though we do not loose him, yet
he may be straightened, that he shall never be able to do us good, except we
pray for him, Col. 4. 3. Fourthly, though he be not straightened, yet our hearts
may be closed up under his Ministry, except we pray for him 1 These. 5. 25.
Fifthly, we have no love of the Spirit in us, except we pray for Gods
Ministers, Romans 15. 30. The Lord himself teaches us how to Pray, Deuteronomy. 33. 8.

Q. 127. How do you prove, That we must Pray for all of our house, for our
Children, and Kindred, and Servants, and for our Parents, and Wife, and
Husband, and Masters?
A. Eliazer prayed for his Master, Genesis 24. 12. Elisha for his Servants, 2
Kings 6. 17. Jacob for his Children, Genesis 48. 16. and Job too. Job 1. 5.
Abraham for Ishmael, Genesis 17. 18. First, because we are bound not to pester
the Church with a naughty generation, if so be we can help it; when Seth had
begotten Enosh, then he set up Prayer, Genesis 4. 26. Secondly, we are bound to
love the glory of God, that our Children may stand up to praise God, when we
are dead and gone; and therefore David had a care of a good seed. Psalm. 22. 30.
and so Abraham of his household after him, Genesis 18. 19. Thirdly, because we
bring forth our Children children of wrath. Ephesians. 2. 3. Fourthly, because its a
great blessing to have godly children, Psalm. 144. 12. and we are blessed in
them much more when they are godly indeed, Deuteronomy. 33. 24. Fifthly, because
otherwise we do but beget them by halves, when once we have gotten them to be
wise and gracious, then we may be better said to have begot them, Pro. 23. 24.

Q. 128. How do you prove that we must more especially pray for the Town and
place, where we live?
A. The inhabitants of Jerusalem prayed for Jerusalem, Psalm. 74. 2. First,
because our selves do live there, and therefore we must pray for it, as Lot
did Zoar. Genesis 19. 21. and yet he was but about to live there, verse. 20.
Secondly, because our peace and good, consists in the peace and good of the
town that we live in, I^r. 29. 7. and except the fear of God be among them,
we cannot comfortably live by them, Levit. 25. 36. and if we pray for them God
can lay a charge upon their consciences not to trouble our resting place, Prove.
24. 15. Thirdly, we may win some of their souls to go along with us to heaven,
Genesis 35. 2. David dwelling at Gath; it should seem he converted Ittai to the
faith, 2 Samuel 15. 19. Fourthly, because we are bound to do such duties, as do
require prayer for them, as for example to exhort them; and therefore Phillip
did so to Nathaniel his neighbor, John. 1. 45. Levi being converted himself
got his neighbors to be at his house to meet Christ, Luke. 5. 29. and so did
Cornelius, Act. 10. 24. Fistly, we our selves may have a great deal of
comfort, if we convert any of their souls, Iam. 5. 20. Sixthly, hereby we may be
helpers to Gods Ministers, Philemou a great Nobleman was Paul's fellow labourer
in this kind, Philem. 1.

Q. 129. Why must we pray for our Enemies?
A. God is pleased to show them this favor, (...) himself do^ not forgive
them, yet he will have us to forgive them, and love them, Math. 5. 44. there
may be more selfe-respects in praying for them that love us, verse. 46. but
there is more godly singulari^y in praying for our enemies, verse. 47. and more
perfection, and sincerity, verse. 48. and more proximity to God, ver. 45. David
fasted and prayed for his enemies, Psalm. 35. 1^. First, because we are more
sensible of there e^nnities and injurings, by reason that we feel them; and
therefore we may the better pray for them, Luke. 23. 31. Secondly, hereby we
have that condition that is required to the forgiveness of our sins, Math.
6. 14. for if we do not forgive them, God will not forgive us. verse. 15.
Thirdly, hereby we may overcome the evil of revenge in our hearts, nay and of
malice in there is, Romans 12. 19, 20. Fourthly, this is that way to commit our
cause unto God, as the poor godly soul does, Psalm. 10. 14. Fifthly, we shall
loose nothing by it, for either our enemies will be mollified toward us, or if
they be not, God will reward us, Prove. 25. 22. Sixthly, it will be a great
comfort to us, we can say thus before God, I have stood before to speak good
for them, Ier. 18. 20. Seventhly, this duty being rightly done is a sign of a
sanctified heart, Act. 7. 60.

Q. 130. What say you of Cursing or imprecation or praying against one; it
seems it is unlawful, Romans 12. 14. neither can we be called unto it, 1 Pet,
3. 9. for it proceeds from hatred, now hatred is Manslaughter, 1 Ioh. 3. 15.
A. We may not wish evil, as it is evil, to any man, but only as it is good,
Gal. 5. 13. First, we may wish evil to a man for the man's good, Psalm. 9. 20.
Secondly, we may pray against a man's sins, Psalm. 7. 9. Thirdly, against all
the plots and counsels and projects of the wicked, that God would curse them,
Psalm. 59. 11, 12. Fourthly, against the life of offenders, I may wish that the
Magistrate would put them to death, not as it is harm to them, but as it is a
good to the Church, or State, or Parish, that we live in, Psalm. 101. 8. as for
these cursing speeches of Plague, and Murraine, and Vengance, and Devil, that
these evils might take one, they are the speeches of tongues set on fire of
hell, especially as they are used, Iam. 3: 6. Nay, a man must not curse Satan
as it is the Apocrypha, Ecclesiast. 21. 27. much less the good creatures of
God, as people curse their meat, the weather, or a stone that they stumble at,
Romans 3. 14. yet we may absolutely curse the enemies of the Lord in the
general; because we mean such as are finally enemies, Psalm. 68. 1, 2. and if
we had a spirit of discerning in particular too, 2. Tim. 4. 14. We read of
three kinds of Cursing, first, optative, Psalm. 109. 6. Secondly, imperative,
Judge. 5. 23. Thirdly, indicative or declarative, so Gods Ministers curse the
wicked whenever they preach, Ier. 11. 3.

Q. 131. Is Thanksgiving a part of prayer?
A. It is a calling upon God, Psalm. 105. 1. and the very thanking of God for
mercies received, is a kind of praying for new mercies, Col. 1. 3. and by our
thankfulness for grace that we have, it may be known that we request grace
that we ^ave not, Phil. 4. 6. and our maine Thanksgiving is prayer wise, Lord
make me thankful, we must ask it of God, and call upon him for it, Psa. 116.
13. Thanksgiving is called by the name of prayer, the Pharisee prayed thus, God
I thank ^hee, Luke. 18. 11. and if we would persevere in prayer, a thankful
heart is the best to continue ^^, Col. 4. 2. and yet it is harder then prayer
it self. There were ten askers to one thanker, Luke. 17. 15, 16. First, because
our nature is like the hors^eech, still it cries give, give, Pro. 30. 15.
Secondly, because there is more self-love in prayer, but thankfulness is more
contrary to self-love, 2 Timothy 3. 2. Thirdly, because our hearts are apt to
love the blessing more then God the giver of it* the pleasure more then God the
bestower of it, verse. 4. Fourthly, because we are apt to be less and less
mindful of former benefits, whereas thanksgiving is an everlasting grace,
Psalm. 79. 15. Fifthly, we are apt to be discontented, if Gods blessings do not
every way please us; now thanksgiving is a cheerful grace, Isa. 51. 3. Sixthly.
there is no holiness in Thanksgiving, Psalm. 97. 12.

Q. 132. What say you of Thanksgiving for Gods spiritual mercies?
A. We must be thankful for them, Ephesians. 1. 3. First, for our knowledge, or else
it is accursed unto us, Romans 1. 21. Secondly, for any power against sin, Romans
7. 25. Thirdly, for victory over death and hell, 1 Cor. 1^. 57. so for peace of
conscience, Col. 3. 17. so for ability to serve God in our callings, 1 Timothy 1.
12. but we must be sure that we have these blessings, or else we mock God, we
must have faith, or else we can, not thank God for it, Col. 2. 7. when one
says, God I thank thee, for electing me, and yet does not know it, it is vain,
1 Thessalonians. 1. 2, 4. none but the redeemed of the Lord can say, Lord I thank
thee, for thine everlasting mercies, Psalm. 107. 1, 2. we must be cheefely
thankful for spiritual mercies; first, because they are mercies for our
souls, Psalm. 66. 15, 16. Secondly, they are eternal, Psalm. 100. 4, 5. Thirdly,
peculiar to Gods Elect, as says Tit. 1. 1. and the spirit of prayer, Luke 18.
7. bowels of mercy, and the like, Col. 3. 10. Fourthly, they are rarer, Math.
11. 25. Fistly, they bring with them the blessings of this life, 1 Timothy 4. 8.
Sixthly, to be thankful for such mercies is a good antidote against sin,
Ephesians. 5. 3, 4. which a man can never be to any purpose, except he can say, God
is my God, Philem. 4.

Q. 133. What temporal mercies must we be thankful for, and why?
A. First, for covering us in our mothers womb, Psalm. 139. 13. for our life.
Psalm. 63. 4. and breath, Psalm. 150. 6. for the counti^^ance of life, Psalm. 30.
3. Secondly, for our food and raiment, Genesis 28. 20. and for our maintenance,
whether it be rich or poor, for both is from God, Pro. 22. 2. for the
convenience of our dwelling, as it is said of Iustus, his house joined hard to
the Synagogue, Act. 18. 7. Thirdly, for our peace and safety, this is another
blessing of God, 1 King. 4. 25. Fourthly, for preserving us from ill accidents
and mishappes, fires, inundations, or any evil casualties, yea for all his
benefits, Psalm. 116. 12. First, because the Lord does call for it, Psalm. 107.
8. and it is his will, 1 Thessalonians. 5. 18. Secondly, the Lord is angry when we are
not thankful* ^^ Chron. 32. 25. Thirdly, Gods remporall mercies are graces,
Genesis 33. 5. Jesus Christ may be seen in the recovering out of any Ague, Act. 9.
34. Fourthly, we are less then the least of them, Genesis 32. 10 we are nothing,
2 Cor. 12. 1^. Fifthly, Thanksgiving is a multiplying duty. Math. 15. 36.
Sixthly, there is goodness in Thanksgiving Psalm. 92. 1. Seventhly, to be
thankful for temporal blessings, is the way to be thankful for spiritual,
and if we be not thankful for them, we will be thankful for nothing;
therefore an unthankful man, and an evil man is all one, Luke. 6. 35. and so
unthankful, unholy, 2 Timothy 3. 2. Lastly, to be thankful as for meat, is to
eat to the Lord, Romans 14. 9.

Q. 134. Must we not be thankful to God for his mercies upon others?
A. Yes, Psalm. 147. 1, 2, 3. whether a particular person, Philem. 4. or a whole
family, 2 John. 4. or a whole parish, Phil. 1. 3. or the Church, Act. 11. 18.
or good Magistrates, 1 King. 10. 9. we must thank God not only for saving grace
that we perceive others have, 1 Thessalonians. 1. 3. but also for common grace, Phil.
1. 18. there was but a little good in the ^ow^e Clarke, he did but speak a good
word for Paul, and Aristarchus and Gaius, yet Luke does record it as a
blessing, Act. 19. 35. Gamaliel a mere civil man, yet when he did but
pleasure the Apostles a little, it is registered as a mercy, Act. 5. 34. the
Barbarians making a warm fire for the Apostle is related as a kindness, Act.
28. 2. for God is glorified thereby, when the people did but wonder at the
Word, as any of Gods works, this is a glory unto God, Math. 9. 8. and therefore
they are wretched. First, who have not grace nor goodness; for we cannot give
thanks for them, but rather bewail them, Phil. 3. 18. Secondly, who though
they have mercies and graces, yet they do not communicate them to others, to
occasion thanksgiving, they are like with-holders of Corn whom the people
curse, Prove. 11. 26. Thirdly, who envy and repine at the blessings of others;
consider therefore, first, if we envy our brothers good, does us no good but
harm, Job. 5. 2. Secondly, it is safer for us that another should have such
and such blessings then we, for then they must give account and not we, Luke.
16. 2. Thirdly, it is better for us too, is it not better that the eye should
have the blessing of Sight, then the foot or the hand, 1 Cor. 12. 21,

Q. 135. Because Confession is to be joined with prayer, Dan. 9. 20. and is put
^or Prayer, Nehem. 9. 3. Tell me whether is it necessary to prayer? to confess
our sins in it?
A. Express confession is not necessary always in Prayer, Act. 4. 24. but
implicit is when the Apostles prayed God for boldness, they did implicitly
confess their want of it, verse. 29. one of these two confessions is
necessary, for confession it is put for prayer, Dan. 9. 4. First, because
prayer it self does confess our poverty of spirit, Luke. 1. 53. and it
infers humbling of our selves and a sense of our own insufficiency; for if
we were sufficient in our selves, what need we go to God, Iam. 4. 10.
Secondly, both we and our prayers are vile, and unclean, Job. 40. 4. but
express confession is necessary, when our consciences is fouled with guilt,
Psalm. 32. 5. not to inform God; for he knows men's sins, 2 King. 19. 27. but
First, to clear the Lords justice, Nehem. 9. 31, 32, 33. Secondly, to obtain
mercy, Prove. 28. 13. Thirdly, to lay hold on Gods faithfulness, 1 John. 1. 9.
I do not mean of every particular sin; for first, our sins are
innumerable and cannot all be reckoned up, Psalm. 40. 12. Secondly, some of them
we know not, Psalm. 19. 12. but our greivouser sins; then we must particularly
confess, 1 Samuel 12. 19. First, because these show that we have need of a God
of salvation, Psalm. 51. 14. Secondly, such sins most wast conscierce, most
dead the heart, and most binder us from seeking Gods faco, Hos. 5. 15. such are
the roots of many other sins, and if we root them out, many others will the
easilier fall off. 1. Tim. 6. 10.

Q. 136. As Manoah said to the Angel, how shall I order the Child Judge. 13:
12. So may I say of Confession, how shall we order our Confession, how shall
we make it?
A. We must do with Confession a^ Christ says of Hearing, we must take heed
how, Luke 8: 18. First, the confession of sin, must be naked, without hiding
of ought, Prove. 28. 13: though the committing of it be the worse, the less we
do hide it, Isa. 3. 9. Secondly, by way of judging our selves, 1 Cor. 11. 31.
and inditing our selves, 1 Chronicles. 21. 8. Thirdly, with grief and sorrow, and
compunction, and smiting of our bres^, Luke 18. 13. Fourthly, shame and
confusion of face, Ezra 9. 6. casting our spirits and selves down, Ezra 10. 1.
Fifthly, giving over our old company, and seperating our selves from them,
Nehem. 9. 2. Sixthly, accepting the punishment of our iniquity, Levit. 26. 40.
41. not only confessing our sins, Dan. 9. 4. but setting our hearts to it,
verse. 3. Seventhly, with Faith, Act. 19. 18. and with having our sins ever
before us, Psalm. 51. 3. Besides this confession before God, in some cases there
must be a confession; first, before the Magistrate, Ioh. 7. 19. Secondly,
before a Brother, 1 Samuel 26. 21. Thirdly before one another, Iam. 5. 16.
Fourthly, before a Minister, Mark 1. 5.

Q. 137. Whether are we bound to pray the Lords Prayer? ^ust those very words
and no other, there be some suspicious people, that say, let us pray for this,
and let us pray for that, and let us Pray for the estate of the whole Church;
and let us pray for the King, and for all these things, let us say the Lords
prayer; do these men do well?
A. No? Christ when he bids us say Our Father which art in heaven, etc. Luke
11. 2. He does not mean, that we should precisely keep our selves to these
words, but that we should Pray after that manner, Math. 6. 9. As Ministers
should preach nothing but the Word, 2 Timothy 4. 2. and yet they may give the
sense in other words, Nehem. 8. 8. First, because the Apostles prayed in other
words, and did more specialize their Petition, Act. 1. 24. Secondly, this
prayer is diversely set down by the Evangilists, one way in one Math. 6. 11.
another way in Luke, Luke. 11. 3. one way in one, Math. 6. 12. another way in
the other, Luke. 11. 4. Thirdly, who knows this is all that Christ uttred,
John. 21. 25. we see plainly Matthew sets, down more then Luke does; it may be
Christ spoke more then either has expressed, Math. 6. 13. Fourthly. Christ
himself did not use these very words ever, when he would pray Lazarus alive,
he did not say the Lords prayer over the grave, Ioh. 11. 41. when he would pray
for his Apostles, he did not say the Lords prayer over them, John. 17. 1.
Fifthly, our special sins and wants, do require that we should pray more
specially then so, 2 Kings* 19. 15. Sixthly, we read of praying all night, we
can not think that the Lords prayer was said over and over again and again,
Luke. 6. 12. we are to continue in prayer, what by going over and over the
Lords prayer? no, Col. 4. 2. neither is it necessary to conclude our prayers
with this, Act. 4. 30. and yet we may if we will, Luke. 11. 2. neither is there
any thing against it. No, though it be scripture, the same thing may be
scripture and the word of God, and yet the prayer of a man, Psalm. 90. 12.

Q. 138. Why does our Savior teach us to call God father in our prayers?
A. First, to reach us we cannot pray to him, except he be our Father, and we
have the spirit of his Son, Gal. 4. 6. Secondly, to assure us that he will
give us good things, Luke 11. 13. Thirdly, to call no man father on earth, for
he is our own father, Math. 23. 9. Fourthly, that we may behave our selves
toward him as a Father, Deuteronomy. 32. 6. First, to honor him as a father, Mal. 1.
6. Secondly, to count our selves sojourners, as long as we be absent from him,
1 Pet. 1. 17. Thirdly, to be separate from the children of this world, and to
touch no unclean thing, 2 Cor. 6. 18. Fourthly, to be followers of God, seeing
he is our father, Ephesians. 5. 1. to be obedient children, taking heed of all
lusts, 1 Pet. 1. 14. to continue so doing to the end, and to overcome;
otherwise he is not our Father, nor we his Children, Rev. 21. 7. If we
desire that he should be our Father, first, we must be fatherless otherwise,
Psalm. 85. 5. Secondly, we must receive Christ, and then we shall have the power
of calling him father, Ioh. 1. 12. Thirdly, we must get the Lord to say so to
our hearts, Hos. 1. 10. Fourthly, we must be sure that we be Peacemakers,
Math. 5. 9. Fifthly, we must love our enemies, and lend freely, Luke 6. 35.
Lastly, we must be the good seed begotten again under the Kingdom of grace,
Math. 13. 38.

Q. 139. Why our Father, not my Father?
A. We may pray also my Father, Luke 15. 18. and we are taught to do so in
private, Math. 6. 6. for, first, Nature teaches that the creature should have
a particular propriety in God, whom it calls upon, Jon. 1. 6. Secondly, we
have need of a particular propriety in God, that we may strengthen our
Petition, Luke 15. 19. Thirdly, that we may come thankfully before him, Romans 1.
8: Fourthly, that we may come with filial affections, and never run away from
him, Ier. 3. 19. but our Savior puts it in the Plural number, first, because
we are to pray with others, Acts 20. 36. Secondly, we are to Pray for others,
Iam. 5. 16. Thirdly, to teach us to love one another, and not to deal
unbrotherly one with another, Mal. 2. 10 Fourthly, to show us that God is
universally a Father to all his elect, and he is not like an earthly father,
that has but one Blessing, or few blessings, Genesis 27. 38. nay, though all the
company that join with us in Prayer, be not adopted unto God; yet if two or
three be the mouth of the company, may pray Our Father, Isa. 63 16. the meeting
is denominated a congregation of Saints from them two or three, Psalm. 149. 1.
there is a communication of Phrases; the mouth of the assembly knowing there be
some wicked, though some be not; yet by the communication of phrases, he may
say, We have done wickedly, though neither himself, nor many of the company
have done so, Nehem. 9. 33. Besides, God is in a general sense the Father of
such as are rebellious, Isa. 1. 2. and they may equivocally be said to be in
Christ, John 15. 2.

Q. 140. What is the meaning of Heaven in Prayer?
A. Heaven signifies, first the region of the air, Jer. 8. 7. Secondly, the
place of the Sun, Moon* and stars, Genesis 15. 5. Thirdly, the Church of Jesus
Christ, Rev. 12. 7. Fourthly, the blessed Angels, Job 15. 15. Fifthly, God
himself, Da^. 4. 26. Sixthly, the habitation of Gods holiness, where the
glorified Angels are in bliss, and enjoy the beatificall vision of God, and so
it is mean^ here especially, 1 Kings 8. 30. which is called the third heaven, 2
Cor. 12. 2. far above all other created heavens, Ephesians. 4. 10. it self being
a created thing too, Heb. 11. 10. Gods childrens house and home 2 Cor. 5. 1.
Gods holy hill. Psalm. 24. 3. from whence he blesses his People, Deuteronomy. 26. 15.
where he sits as a great Prince on his thro^e, Psalm. ^1. 4. and he is said
to be in heaven; first, to strike Reverence into us, Eccles. 5. 2. Secondly, to
let us understand, he can do whatsoever he will, Psalm. 115. 3. Thirdly, to
lift and raise up our hearts in prayer, Psalm. 123. 1. Fourthly, to show how
infinitely he is above us, his thoughts above ours, his motions above ours,
Isa. 55. 9. Fifthly, to express Gods condiscending goodness, that he being in
heaven will deigne to look upon a poor soul, Isa. 66. 1, 2. and yet God is
not confined to heaven, as though he were there only, Psalm. 139. 7, 8. No,
he fills heaven and earth too, I^r. 23. 24. and the whole world is not able to
contain him, 2 Chronicles. 6. 18.

Q 141. For the first Petition, Hallowed be thy Name; what is the meaning of
name here?
A. First, the Lord himself, his very Person and nature, Deuteronomy. 28. 58. for
Name is often put for ones person, Acts 1. 15. so also, Rev. 3. 4. Secondly,
Gods attributes, Exodus 34. 5. Thirdly, Gods esteem that he should have in all
the world, Psalm. 8. 1. Fourthly, Gods worship, Genesis 4. 26. Piftly, any of Gods
works, or word, or any thing whereby he is known, Exodus 20. 7. His name is
Jehovah the Lord, Isa. 42. 8. or I am that I am, Ioh. 3. 13, 14. As Christ said
of himself before Abraham was, I am, John 8. 58. ^he most High, Psalm. 9. 2.
El-shaddai, or ^^e Almighty, or the All-sufficient, Genesis 17. ^^ He has sweet
names in the new Testament, the GOD of Peace, Romans 15. 33. ^he GOD of Patience
and Consolation, verse. 5. the Father of Mercies and the God of all Comfort, 2
Cor. 1. 3. etc. Indeed Gods ^ame is unutterable, no word is able to ex^resse
who he is, Prove. 30. 4. It is transcen^ent above all names, Phil. 2. 9. and
wonderful Isa. 9. 2. and secret, Judge. 13. 18. and hence ^^ is; first, that no
name is able sufficiently t^ ^^t him forth, Genesis 32. 29. Secondly his name ^^
expressed by negatives, to show that we ^an rather tell what is not his name,
then what is, Immortal, Invisible, 1 Timothy 1. 17. Unsearchable, Psalm. 147. ^.
Infinite, Psalm. 147. ^. Thirdly, his name is borrowed from his effects, God
that made the world, Acts 17. 24. and from his back-parts, Exodus 33. 23.
Fourthly, figurative, and not proper, Exodus 15. 3. Prove. 18. 10. O then GOD
being so great, what a condiscending goodness is it in him to take upon him
such a poor name as this, Our God, the God of Abraham, Exodus 3. 15.

142. Why Hallowed or Sanctified, rather ^^^^ Glorified; why is that word used
rather the^ this?
A. Because Gods holiness is the cause why we should glorify him, Romans 15.
4. Secondly, because Gods greatness most appears in his holiness, Isa. 12.
6. and so does his might, Luke. 1. 49. and therefore we call Kings sacred, and
the greater a person is the more sacred; and therefore of all creatures the
Lord made his Angels most holy, Luke. 9. 26. Thirdly, Gods holiness is the
beauty and luster of all his attributes, Psalm. 96. 9. nay it is the beauties,
Psalm. 110. 3. Fourthly, when the Angels would pick out an attribute to
glorify God most in, they chose his holiness, Holy, holy, holy, not glorious,
glorious, glorious, Isa. 6. 3. Fifthly, we cannot glorify God, except we be
holy, 1 Pet. 2. 9. nay it is rather an obscuring of Gods glory, when a profane
soul praises him; and therefore o^^ hearts, and our tongues, and
conversations must be holy, Pet. 1. 15, 16. we must sanctify him in
righteousness, Isa. 5. 16. not as though we can put holiness upon God, that
he had not before; in this case we had need that he should sanctify us, 1 Thessalonians. 5. 23. but we must make his name to appear to be holy by our doings,
Isa. 39. 23.

Q. 143. For the second Petition, thy Kingdom ^ome, what say you of that?
A. God has a fourfold Kingdom. First, the kingdom of his power: whereby
he is over all, 1 Chronicles. 29. 11. and rules over all, Psalm. 103. 19. and
reigns in the Kingdoms of men, Dan. 4. 32. and has the Keys of hell and
death, Rev. 4. 18. Devils and reprobates and all shall bow to this kingdom
passively, as well as the good Angels and elect actively, Romans 14. 11. though
they yet say, he shall not reign over them, Luke. 19. 14. Secondly, the
Kingdom of his Gospel, whereby he reigns over the Christian world, both good
and bad, Math. 13. 47. which God threatnes to take away, when people are
unworthy, Matthew. 21. 43. which is called a Kingdom, because it offers men a
kingdom, Matthew. 4. 17. and because by it Christ reigns in his Saints, Rev.
15. 2. and in his enemies too, but in a different manner, Rev. 19. 15. Thirdly,
the Kingdom of his grace, whereby he rules only i^ his elect; for this
kingdom is within them, Luke. 17. 21. consisting in righteousness, and peace,
and joy, Romans 14. 17. bringing every thought into obedience, 2 Cor. 10. 5. and
making them Kings too, Rev. 1. 6. and to rule as it were with God, over sin
and the world, and the Devil, Hos. 11. 12. and this Kingdom is not of this
world, Ioh. 18. 36. Fourthly, the Kingdom of glory, that flesh and blood
cannot enter into, 1 Cor. 15. 50.

Q. 244. For the third Petition. Thy will be done, what say you of that, why is
Gods will se^ next to his Kingdom?
A. First, Because the greater his Kingdom is the more he stands upon his
will, we see this in earthly Kings, Dan. 11. 3. Secondly, because the doing of
Gods will, is the giving the glory of his Kingdom unto him Heb. 13. 21.
Thirdly, because by doing of his will, we show that he is our God and King,
Psalm. 143. 10. because by doing of his will, we show that we are worshippers of
him, Ioh. 19. 31. Fourthly, hereby we show that as God is a great God, so he is
great with us* ^s Moses was great with the Egyptians, because he could borrow
of them whatsoever he would, Exodus 11. 3. why did David greatly praise God; and
give him whatsoever obedience he would, because God was great with him, Psalm.
145. 3. Fifthly, because by doing of Gods will, we may enter into Gods Kingdom,
Math. 7. 21. La^^ly, this is to be men after Gods own heart, when we fulfill
the Lords will, Act. 13. 22.

Q. 145. Has God such a will in him, as he calls a conditional will? as for
example, to will all men's salvation if they repent?
A. Properly there cannot be a conditional will in God. First, because such a
will supposes a superior that may hinder, Act. 18. 21. Secondly, it supposes
ignorance how things may fall out, as Abraham willed his servant to fetch a
wife for Isaac out of the land of his kindred, Genesis 24. 4. if she were
willing, verse. 8. nevertheless improperly it may be given to God, not as
though his will can have a condition, for that's the property of a created will,
to have a condition of it, Iam. 4. ^5. but because the thing willed of God may
have a condition, Isa. 7. 9. now, that the Lord may be said to have a
conditional will in some sense is plain. First, because he is said to will
the connection of things, when he does not will the things a sunder and
therefore he wills them only upon the condition of a connection God would have
all men to repent, and come to the knowledge of the truth, 1 Timothy 2. 4.
Secondly because he is said to will the salvation of all believers, and true
penitent persons, and therefore if a reprobate do believe, he wills his
salvation, 1 King. 11. 38. this is true of God toward a reprobate, if thou will obey me, I will bless thee, Deuteronomy. 7. 12, 13.

Q. 146. What say you of Gods simple an^ positive will?
A. God wills a thing simply two ways. First, by purposing and dec^e^ing,
Romans 9. 11. either to be wrought by himself, which is his working will, Ephesians.
1. 11. and so he wills his Elect to believe, and to be saved, Act. 13. 48. or
to be done by another, Act. 4. 28. and so he wills the hardening of the
reprobate, Rom: 9. 17, 18. Secondly, by likeing and approving, which is the
will of his word, Psalm: 40. 8. which tells us what is acceptable unto God,
Romans 12. 2. and thus he wills every man to repent, 2 Pet. 3. 9. and all men
to come to the knowledge of the truth, and to be saved, 1 Timothy 2. 4. even those
that finally will not. Math. 23. 37. hither is referred that distinction of
Gods will either secret or revealed, Deuteronomy. 29. 29. not as though God has two
wills, for it is an imperfection to have two wills* as it is an imperfection to
be of two minds, Iam 4. 8. it argues a change, Act. 28. 6: but it is one and
the same will, whereof one part is secret and unknowen, the other revealed,
Heb. 11. 8. the revealed part and all, was once kept secret and unrevealed,
Romans 16. 25. and God reveals it two ways. First, in his word* whereby Christ
reveals the will of his father to his people, Math. 11. 27. Secondly, in the
event of things, as for example, I do not know whether it be Gods will that I
shall be persecuted for the truth to morrow, yet it is secret, but when I see
that it is so come to pass, the event does reveal it to be the Lords will, 1
Pet. 3. 17.

Q. 147. What say you of Gods secret wilt?
A. It is not for us to know it, Act. 1. 7. no^ ask after it, Judge. 13. 18.
nor pry into it, to search it, Isa. 40. 28. A man is very chary of his secrets;
suppose one should know them, yet he takes ill that he should reveal them,
Prove. 11. 13. would thou know when it is Gods will thou shall dye or be
sick, nay s^ay till himself is pleased to reveal it, who made thee of his
counsel, Romans 11. 34. when Gods will of command is revealed, it is nothing but
unbeleife to be inquisitive what his issue and event shall be, Math. 6. 20. nay
to be doubting about it, it is unbelief, Math. 14. 31. the prying into Gods
secret will abate issues, and the suffering of thy heart to be questioning it,
is the cause of most of thy sins; the Lord had revealed his will unto Jonas,
that he should go and preach to Niniveh, ^on. 1. 2, now Jonas questioning what
Gods will was, the issue should be may be, they will put me to death, may be,
the Lord will spare them, and then I shall be counted a false Prophet, this
made him fly away to Tarshish, Ion. 4. 2. nay it is the cause of most errors
to some, when a part of Gods truth is revealed, enough for faith and salvation,
John: 20. 31. but when people will be tampering beyond, no wonder if they err,
for Gods judgment is unsearchable, Romans 11. 33.

Q. 148. What use do you make of Gods secret will?
A. First, in all our intention, we must be careful to insert this, If it be
Gods will, Iam. 4. 13, 14, 15. either implicitly, 1 Cor. 11. 34. or
expressly. Act. 18. 21. for there may be a thousand counsels in our hearts,
but none of them all can stand, (...) that which is appointed in heaven, Prove.
19. 21. Secondly, we must never be over earnest in our undertakings, least Gods
will coming forth to the contrary, puts us to discontent and vexation, 1 King.
21. 4. Thirdly, we must labor to be provided, for whatsoever may break our
purposes of, John. 11. 11. if it be Gods will our purposes shall never take
effect, he has many ways to do it, Isa. 59. 10. he suffering us to be
inconsiderate, Prove. 15. 22. by taking us away before we effect that we
purposed, Psalm. 146. 4. what a pitiful case had Jonathan been in if he had not
been provided for all, may be he aimed to be next David, when he came to the
crown, 1 Samuel 13. 2. Fourthly, we must beware that we run not against Gods
revealed will, rather then suffer our purposes to be frustrate, the old Prophet
of Bethel, when he had a purpose to get the Prophet of Judah home to his house,
rather then he would be hindered of his purpose he told a wretched* lie, 1 King.
13. 18. the unjust Steward having a purpose to live and make himself friends
rather then he would be hindered of his purpose, he would cousen his Lord, Luke.
16. 4. Fifthly, we must be ready to submit to Gods will against it comes to be
revealed what it is, Act. 21. 4. Sixthly, we must remember that even our own
hearts cannot will as we list, but as God list, Prove. 21. 1. nor our tongues
answer as we list, though we have what to answer* but as God lists. Proverb.
16. 1.

Q. 149. What pray we for in this Petition, thy will be done?
A. First, That we may renounce our own will, Math. 26. 39. whether it be our
^^rnall will, called the will of our flesh, Ephesians. 2. 3. which must be absolutely
renounced, for it is contrary to the will of the spirit, Gal. 5. 17. or our
natural will, whereby we will life and maintenance, and freedom, from
torment, and this we must renounce respectively, namely when Gods will stands
in competition, John. 5. 30. Secondly, we pray that God would make us content
with his will, whether it be disposing of our allowance, Heb. 13. 5. or
correcting us for our sins, 1 Samuel 3. 18. Thirdly, we pray that God would
enable us, to do his commanding will, Psalm. 143. 10. Fourthly, we pray that we
may do it, as Gods Angels do, Psalm. 143. 20. that is, first, readily, without
delay, Psalm. 119. 60. Secondly, willingly, Psalm. 40. 8. that it may be our
meat to do it, John. 4. 34. Thirdly, constantly, 1 Chronicles. 28. 7. Fourthly,
faithfully, not picking and chosing, but all the Lords will, Act. 13. 22.

Q. 150. What say you of the will of Gods word or command, is it the Lords will
that men shall do it or else woe is unto them?
A. Yea, for that is his will by force of a law, Romans 2. 18. and the business
that he bids men to do, Luke. 2. 49. and what ever profane wretches think he
will for a certain require it. Psalm. 10. 13. and if men will not do it, he
himself will see it done one way or other, Ezekiel. 21. 28. Gods word must needs
be his peremptory will, first, because it is his pleasure, Ezra. 10. 11.
Secondly, because he engages his glory upon it, and therefore he wills it above
heaven and earth, Psalm. 148. 13. he will sooner let heaven and earth come to
naught, then any title of his word not be done, Math. 5. 18. his wisdom is
engaged upon it too, and therefore it is called his wisdom, Prove. 2. 2. his
holiness is engaged upon it too, and therefore it is called the word of the
holy one, Job. 6. 10. and his power too, and therefore none that neglect it,
shall escape; except they be stronger then he, ^ Cor. 10. 22. and his
greatness too, his greatness is stamped upon every jot of his word, Hos. 8.
12. Thirdly, its a sign now strongly the Lord wills his word, by the
greatness of the reward that he propounds to them that keep it, Psalm. 19. 11.
and by the greatness of the plagues that he threatens to them that will break
it, Deuteronomy. 28. 59. Fourthly, it appears by the Lords importunity, whereby he
wooeth us to do it, Math. 27. 37. Fifthly by the cost he was at to purchase his
word, he delivered his own son up unto death to procure us this will and
testament, Heb. 9. 16. and therefore how shall they escape that are stubborn
against it and slight it, Heb. 2. 2, 3.

Q. 151. What motives are there to persuade us to do the Lords will?
A. First, if we do the Lords will, the Lord will hear our prayers, Ioh. 9.
31. Secondly, if we do the Lords will we shall abide for ever, 1 Ioh. 2. Thirdly,
27. The doing of Gods will, puts a great Nobility upon us, Mark 3. 35.
Fourthly, hereby we show our selves to be the servants of God, Ephesians. 6. 6.
Fifthly, to do the Lords will, is a sign of one that shall enter into heaven,
Math. 7. 21. Sixthly, by so doing, we please God, Heb. 13. 21. when we do our
own will and not Gods, we exalt our selves above God, Dan. 11. 36. we said in
out Baptism that we should do the Lords will and therefore if we will not, we
are lying children, Isa. 30. 9.

Q. 152. Tho fourth Petition is, Give us this day our daily bread, what is
meant by bread here?
A. First. Bread it self in particular, 2 King. 4. 32. which strengthens man's
heart, Psalm. 104. 15. Secondly, that, and also any other food, Genesis 3. 19. any
meals meat, 2. Kings. 6. 22. even flesh too, Genesis 18. 5, 7. and raiment too,
and whatsoever our natural life needs, Eccl. 11. 1. even all outward things,
Genesis 49, 20. for not only food, but raiment, and warmth and other outward
comforts do feed us; a man may be starved with cold: and therefore whatsoever
helps to satisfy the desire of nature may be called bread, Prove. 20. 13.
Fourthly, it signifies spiritually Christ too, John. 6. 51. and his word, Amo.
8. 11. and his grace, 1 Cor. 5. 8. and his promise, Math. 15. 26. But this
spiritual bread is not here meant, we pray for spiritual bread in the other
petitions, here only for our daily sustenance, Luke. 11. 3. indeed it is good
to raise up our meditations from hence, unto supernatural meat, John. 6. 27.
First, because man lives not by bread only, but by every word of God. Math.
44. Secondly, because a wise man looks higher then the food of his carkase,
Prove. 30. 8. neither is the Sacramental bread here meant, for that we pray
for in the first Petition, it being the fealing of the forgiveness of our
sins, Math. 26. 28.

Q. 153. What does this teach us, that our Savior bids us pray for Bread, and
not for daynties and abundance?
A. To teach us, that having food and raiment therewith to be content, 1 Timothy
6. 8. First, because our life does not consist in abundance, Luke. 12. 15.
Secondly, because there is danger in abundance, specially when we are eager to
have it, Prove. 30. 8. An estate may be great, as a shoe may be too big, or
armout may be too great, and then it hinders one in the using of it, 1 Samuel
17. 39. riches accidentally make it harder for one to go to heaven, Math. 19.
24. Thirdly, if we be not content with such things as we have, be they never so
little, we will never be contented, but covet more and more, Heb. 13. 5.
Fourthly, we are citizens of heaven and strangers here below; and therefore it
does not become us to be having and having. Heb. 11. 9. 10. if we can say, The
Lord is our portion, we have a goodly heritage, Psalm. 16. 6. and therefore we
should pray only for the things that are necessary, Mat. 6. 32. now those
things are necessary that are necessary; first unto nature, nature requires
some food and raiment, or else it will pine, Lam. 4. 4. Secondly, unto our
vocation, as Books to a Scholar* instruments to a Carpenter, meaner means to
people that are of a mean calling, greater to Lords and to Kings, give me not
poverty says the King, because his calling called for more means then so,
Prove. 30. 8. Thirdly, necessary to out charge, whether it be a great charge or
small, 1 Timothy 5. 8. Fourthly, that which is apparently necessary for time to
come too, 2 Cor. 12. 14. when Joseph foresaw a great famine, he laid up
aforehand, Genesis 41. 48.

Q. 154. Why must we pray for temporal things, or for the creatures of God?
A. First, because raiment is good and food is good, and every creature of God
is good, 1 Timothy 4. 4. Secondly, they are useful to many duties, and to the
duty of hospitality, Romans 12. 13. of owing nothing one to another, Romans 13. 8.
of honoring God, Prove. 3. 9. Thirdly, they are necessary with necessity of
need, Math. 6. 32. and with the necessity of convenience, Prove. 30. 8.
Fourthly, the want of them is great temptation to many sins, Prove. 30. 9. and
the very Lions, Psalm. 104. 25. and the ravens teach us to call upon God for
them, Psalm. 147. 9. for though we love them too well, 1 Ioh. 2. 15. and are too
apt to labor for them, John. 6. 27. and to pray carnal prayers for them, Hos.
7. 14. yet we had rather get them any way then by prayers, as by cares, Luke
21. 34. by taking thought, Math. 6. 25. by unlawful, and unrighteous courses,
Luke 16. 9. First, because as long as we think we can help our selves, we love
not to be beholding to another, and therefore is fain to exhort us to pray to
him, Phil. 4. 6. Secondly, because we cannot abide to stand to Gods allowance,
as we must, if we would get him by prayer, and therefore we are prone to
restrain prayer, Job. 15. 4. Thirdly, because prayer is too holy a course for
our corrupt nature to come by them, 1 Timothy 2. 8. Fourthly, because God ^ndents
with us to glorify him, if he give us any thing by prayer, Psa. 50. 15. but we
should pray for them, Genesis 28. 20. First, because that is the way to have
sanctifiedly, 1 Timothy 4. 5. and secondly, without falling into temptation about
them, Math. 26. ^^. and thirdly, most honorably, for it is the honor of our
maintenance, as it was of Christ's, if they come down from heaven, John. 6. 33.

Q. 155. The text says our Br^ad, it speaks if a title we have to the
creatures, what say you of that?
A. There is a two fould title to the creatures. First, a spiritual title,
whereby they are ours, if they be ours by being in Christ, 1 Cor. 3. 22.
Secondly, a civil title, as by descent of inheritance, as Naboths vineyard was
his, 1 King. 21. 3. or by purchase, as the field of Ephron, was Abraham's, Gen^
23. 16, 17. or by honest labor, and covenant, between man and man, as the
party colored Sheep were Jacobs sheep, Genesis 30. 40. the wicked have not a
filial title unto them, because he whom they are without, is heir of all
things, Heb. 1. 2. they only have title to them, which have faith to overcome;
which the wicked have not, Rev. 21. 7. title unto the creature is not founded
upon nature, Gene. 1. 29. but upon the image of God in righteousness and true
holiness, which the wicked have not, ver. 26. and yet First, they have a gift
of providence, though they have forfited Gods creatures, yet God dos not
presently seize upon the forfeiture, but continues the old gift in Adam, Psalm.
115. 6. Secondly, a cogift as it were by reason of cohabitation with the godly,
Deuteronomy. 32. 14. Thirdly, a sufferance, rather then a gift, to be as rods for
the righteous, Ier. 27. 6. Fourthly, a conditional gift, upon condition, that
they will repent and believe in Christ, otherwise the creatures will turn to a
curse to them, Job. 20. 14. if they do eat, they sin because they cannot
eat with faith, Romans 14. 23. if they do not eat, they sin too, because then
they should murder themselves, which they must not, Ast. 16. 34. As Simon
Magus, if he should pray he should sin, by praying without the spirit, if he
should not pray, he should break the commandment of prayer; and yet Peter bid
him pray though, Act. 8. 22.

Q. 156. It seems then that the Anabaptist^call conceit is most false, that
all things are common; and yet we cannot say this is ours, and that is yours,
Give us this day our daily bread?
A. Yea, for first, the Law says thou shall not steal, Exodus 20. 15. Secondly,
the Lord says we must work, and earne and eat our own bread, 2 Thessalonians. 3. 12.
Thirdly, the scripture speaks of ten proprieties, a good Bishop rules well his
own house, 1 Timothy 3. 4. John took Mary into his own house, John. 19. 27.
Fourthly, the action of buying and selling does also prove it, Christ bid his
Disciples to buy meat, John. 4. 8. Fifthly, the Gospel relates diverse rich men,
if there were a community, no one should be richer then another, Joseph of
Arimathea was rich, Math. 27. 57. the Eunuch was rich, Act. 8. 27. Paul does
not advise rich men to make all away they have, but not to trust in their
riches, 1 Timothy 6. 17. Sixthly, the duty of being liberal supposes a
proprieity; for then is a man liberal, when he gives bountifully of his own,
2 Cor. 9. 6. when one beggeth of us, and we let him have, we are said to give.
Math. 5. 42. First, because so is Gods institution at the, first. Act. 16. 27.
and a division of goods and inheritance, is Gods Ordinance, Deuteronomy. 32. 8.
Secondly, so is Gods providence, he makes rich as poor, Prover. 22. 2.
Thirdly, it is not man's sin, when he counts his goods his own, or his house
his own, Simon had a house of his own, Act. 10. 6. Mary a house of her own,
Act. 12. 12. Philip had a house of his own, Act. 21. 8. It is true, first, we
are all one in Christ, in regard of spiritual life but not in civil life,
Gal. 3. 28. for some are Masters and some servants, Ephesians. 6. 5. some rich some
poor, Math. 26. 11. Secondly, there must be a communion of charity, but not
such a communion, as is contrary to all propriety, Heb. 13. 16. nay this kind
of communion supposes a propriety, Prove. 5. 16, 17. Thirdly, the Gospel
commands a readiness to forsake all that we have, when we are called, but not
always an actual forsaking of all, Luke. 14. 33. Fourthly, the Church may
stand in need of a community of goods, Act. 2. 44. and that all goods should be
common, Act. 4. 32. and yet that does suppose, first, that our goods are our
own, and in our own power to make common, Act. 5. 4. Secondly, nor a
necessity, but a freeness of giving, 2 Cor. 9. 7. Thirdly, it was only by
accident, in regard of the multitudes of poor Believers, Luke 12. 33.

Q. 157. Why pray you not for weekly or yearly Bread, but give us this day our
daily bread?
A. That we may not be solicitous for to morrow, Genesis 24. 12. for first, this
day will afford us business enough to do, we had not need to preoccupate for
the morrow, Math. 6. 34. Secondly, if we be careful for the morrow to day, we
shall be forced to care for it twice; and therefore let us take care for to
day, and to morrow, for to morrow, Math. 6. 34. Thirdly, we need not to
morrow, till to morrow is come, it is only this day, that is the season of our
need, Psalm. 145. 15. Fourthly, it is the act of Faith to live from hand to
mouth, and it is against Faith to be thoughtfull for to morrow, Math. 6. 34.
not, but we may provide for to morrow, Genesis 30. 30. When the Lord gives us
this day, a surplus for to morrow, Faith allows this, 1 Timothy 5. 8. Again,
the Lord teaches us to Pray every day, for every days blesssing; for first,
Gods mercies flow not from him all at once, but some to day and some to morrow,
Psalm. 68. 19. for they flow from him as water from a fountain, Psalm. 36. 9.
some grace to day, and new to morrow, Zach. 13. 1. Secondly, the covenant of
Grace requires that we should sue to it continually, 1 These. 5. 17. Again,
to show the fickleness of our life; for what is it? Iam. 4. 14. Joshua, though
now well, yet looked upon this Day, as the day of his death, Josh. 23. 1^. for
first, we may dye to day, we do not know when* Genesis 27. 2. Secondly, if we do
not dye to day, yet if we be plodding now for to morrow, it will make us the
more unwilling to dye to morrow* ^am. 4. 13. Thirdly, the not thinking of Death
as a thing present, makes one the more subject to sin, Amos 6. 3. Again, to
teach us to look out for heaven, which is not for a day, nor for a year, but
for ever, Ioh. 6. 27. an Immortal inheritance, 1 Pet. 1. 4.

Q. 158. If our daily Bread be ours, why do we beg it, and if we beg it,
how is it ours?
A. It is the gift of God, Psalm. 146. 7. though the material cause of it be
from below, yet the efficient cause is from above, Iam. 1. 17. nay, if we be
his children; first, it is the gift of his everlasting mercy, Psalm. 136. 27.
Secondly, as an appurtenance together with Christ, Romans 8. 32. as an addition
to the Kingdom of God, Math. 6. 33. Indeed he would have us make it ours,
first, by believing in Christ, 1 Cor. 3. 22. Secondly, by honest labor, 2
These. 3. 10. and yet though we get it by gifts from friends, or by our own
industry and labor, yet it is he that does give it unto us, Deuteronomy. 8. 17, 18.
and then do we acknowledge it to be his gift, when we do show it by our
practice, and our dependence upon him, using it to his glory, Hos. 2. 8. and
because that givers among men never want beggars, we should be ^utors unto
him for these things, for he is the hearer of prayers, Psalm. 65. 2. again if
he be the giver, we must not have an evil eye, though he give others more, us
less, Math. 20. 1^. again, if he be the giver, we should not lay out his gifts
upon that which will not profit us, but use them to our good, Isa. 55. 2.
Again if he be the giver, we should say of every thing that we have, This is
Gods mercy, of every morsel of bread, This is Gods mercy, of every nights
sleep, This is Gods mercy; the Lord curses people, when he renders them their
deserts, Psalm. 28. 4. again if these be his gifts, then they cannot help our
needs, further then his influence is in them. David had clothes, and did use
them, and yet could not get warmth, 1 King. 1. 1. and though we have them, yet
we have need to pray for them as though we had them not; for without him, they
are and they are not, Prove. 23. 5.

Q. 159. Forgive us our debts; why are sins called debts?
A. Not because they are debts that are owed, for so good works are debts, as
to love one another, Romans 13. 8. not to live after the flesh, Romans 8. 12. to
publish the Gospel, Romans 1. 14. but because they are debts owed, and not
paid, Math. 18. 27. First, they are called debts, because God is the creditor,
Luke. 7. 41. Secondly, because we are indebted to his Justice, to pay the
utmost farthing, Math. 5. 25. and therefore it is a misery to be a sinner, 1 Samuel 22. 2. for, first, he loves not to come into Gods presence, except he be
brought, Math. 18. 24. Secondly, he loves to be shifting with God, as the
unjust Steward and the debtors were agreed to cozen their master, Luke 16. 5.
Thirdly, he is apt to leave the surety in the lurch, Prove. 22. 26. Fourthly, he
is subject to be arrested of Gods justice, as a debtor is of man's, 2. King. 4.
1.

Q. 160. What is sin?
A. It is the transgression of Gods law, 1 Ioh 3. 4. whether by omiting of what
is commanded, Math. 25. 42. or by committing of what is forbidden, Ier. 2. 13.
or by failing in manner of doing it, for in every thing we do, be it
materially never so good we do sin, Gal. 7. 20. whether it be in
essentialls, as Iehus obedience is called murder, Hos. 1. 4. or in some
circumstantialls, as Rebekahs desiring that Jacob might have the blessing,
there was a lie cleaving to it, Genesis 27. 15. whereby the person becomes guilty,
Ezekiel. 22. 4. both with the guilt of offense, 1 Cor. 11. 27. the sin being
laid to his charge, Act. 7. 60. and with the guilt of death and damnation,
Romans 1. 7. by which two guilts, as with chains, the soul is bound in heaven,
in earth, Math. 16. 19. and the conscience defiled, Tit. 1. 15. which can never
be purged again, but by the blood of Christ, 1 John. 1. 7. besides, sin
leaves a blot and an uncleanness behind it upon the so^^, and all the whole
man, Math. 15 11.

Q. 161. Are any sins so small, that they are venial, and do not deserve
hell?
A. No, Math. 5. 19. though it be but the least breach; but of one ^ot of Gods
Law, ver. 18. or but an idle word, Math. 12. 36. or but a lust, Romans 7. 7.
though it be but in the least thing, Gal. 3. 10. the Lord does not say the
wages of a great sin, but sin is death, Romans 6. 23. he does not say, thou
shall not steal a pound, or a shilling, but thou shall not steal, though it
be but a farthing, Math. 19. 18. It is a cursed speech, is this such a matter
be the matter never so little, that is not it, but the littleness of the will,
Math. 26. 41. much^esse of will, aggravates any sin exceedingly, Heb. 10. 26.
when people say we will not do thus and thus, or we will do thus and thus,
Iere. 6. 16. for against whom do thou sin? Isa. 57. 23. even against an
infinite God, Psalm. 145. 3. and thou art nothing to him, Dan. 4. 35. and less
then nothing in his hands thy breath is, Dan, 5. 23. and yet sins are not all
equal, Luke. 12, 47, 48. and though all sins be mortal, yet by reason of
Gods mercy* all sins are not unto death, John. 5. 16. namely when a man is in
Christ, then no sin can damn him that he has committed, Romans 8. 1. again
some sinues are little in comparison of other some, Ezekiel. 16. 48.

Q. 162. How comes sin, to be said to be ours?
A. First, Actual sin comes to be ours, by committing of it, Ier. 16. 10. or
by being accessory to an others committing of it, Nehem. 13. 17. by teaching
others to sin, Ier. 28. 16. or by commanding others to sin, 2 Samuel 13. 28.
or by tice^ng, others to sin, 1 King. 21. 25. or by giving others a sinful
example, Gal. 2. 14. or by conniving, 1 Samuel 2. 29. or by remissness of
reproving sin, so as the reproved is never the more restrained, 1 Samuel 3. 13.
or of too little preaching to the conscience, Ezekiel. 33. 6. or by keeping
company with them that do sin, Romans 1. 32. or being an others instrument in
sinning, 1 Samuel ^. 18. or by feeding upon sins of others, Hos. ^8. Secondly,
original sin is made ours, by ^eing conceived in it Psalm. 51. 5. and borne
of the (...) John. 3. 6. not by imitation only for First, one entered into the
world by one man, and not by every man, Romans 5. 12. and we were all ^^ad in
Adam, before we could imitate him, 1 (...). 15. 22. or sin after his
similitude, Romans ^^ 14. Secondly original sin is before actual, for First,
we are unclean before unclean things ^^ue from us, ^ob. 14. 4. Thirdly, we are
sinners ^^om the womb, and therefore before we do ^ctually imitate our
parents. Psalm. 58. 3. Indeed the actual sins of our parents are not made
^urs, but only by imitation, Ezekiel. 18. 14. and yet even they too thus far are
ours; as that we are to be specially humbled for them, Ier* 3. 25.

Q. 163. Forgiveness of sin being there ^ut by a Synecdoche, the part, for
the whole the whole being Justification, tell me what is Justification?
A. First, it is a free act of God. Romans 3. 24. Secondly, looking at his own
grace, and not at any good works in man, Romans 11. 6. Thirdly, whom he
considers, as formally a sinner, or ungodly, Romans 4. 5. Fourthly, whereby he
freeth him from the Law, and from sin, and from death, Romans 8. 2. and makes
him righteous in his account. 2 Cor. 5. 2^. Fifthly for Christ his sake, ver.
19. Sixthly, apprehended by faith, Romans 5. 1. and therefore justification
consists of two parts* Zac. 3. 4. The 1. is the not imputing of sin, Romans 4.
8. the second, is the imputing of righteousness, verse. 6. for Christ has done
two things; First, he has made reconciliation for sin. And secondly, he has
brought in everlasting righteousness, Dan. 9. 24. And therefore the Scripture
does not mean that Justification is only by Christ's passive obedience, when
he says, It is by his blood, Romans 5. 9. but it is also by his active
Obedience, verse. 19. whereby he fulfilled all Righteousness, Math. 3. 15. and
the Law, Romans 10. 4. being made under the law for that purpose, Gal. 4. 4. he
fulfilled not the law for himself, for the qualification of his Person, that
he might be a holy Sacrifice for sin* for he was originally holy, being Jesus
Christ the Righteous, 1 John 2. 1. himself had no need to be turned over to
the Law, by reason of his hypostaticall Union, he was holy from the womb,
Luke 1. 35. and therefore he put himself under the law, to fetch
Righteousness from thence, for his redeemed ones, Gal. 4. 5. he did all that
he did for them,, and suffered all that he suffered for them. Nay, he was
borne for them, as well as Crucified for them, Isa. 9. 6. and he sanctified
himself for them, John 17. 19. and as he dyed for them, so he lived for them
too, John 14. 19. His Incarnation, Birth, Circumcision, Baptism, his Life and
conversation, and Death, from the womb, to the Cross, all was for them: yea,
self and all, was for them, Gal. 2. 20. Yea also he rose again, for them,
Romans 4. 25. and now lives in heaven for them, Heb. 7. 25. and so well may he
be called, The gift of God, Ioh. 4. 10.

Q. 146. Who is the Author of forgiveness of sin?
A. God, even God only, Isa. 43. 25. First, because this is his glory when
Moses would feign see the Lords glory, Exodus 33. 18. The Lord told him he was
the forgiver of sin, Exodus 34. 7. Secondly, he only can forgive sin, if
one do forgive sin, that has not a power to do it, it is nothing, Mark. 2.
7. Thirdly, sin is committed only against God, Psalm. 51. 4. Fourthly, he
only can give the Conscience peace, Romans 5. 1. Though all the world should
say, such a one is an honest man, such an one has his sins forgiven him, his
Conscience will misgive him for all that; except the eternal Spirit set it on,
Heb. 9. 14. Forgiveness of sins is in Christ's name only, Luke 24. 47. and
through his Blood, Math. 26. 28. when God himself puts away a man's sins by
it, Isa. 44. 22. Indeed in a trespass are two things; first, the obliquity or
evil that is in it. Secondly, the hurt or det^iment that redounds unto man by
it; as it is an obliquity, it is an aberration from Gods law; so only God can
pardon it, for it is he that pardons all sin, Ier. 33. 8. as it is a hurt
unto man, so far as it concerns him, he may and must forgive it, Math. 6*
14. and whereas it is said, That Gods Ministers may forgive sins, Ioh. 20.
23. That is only declaratorily, as John declared unto them, whom he wrote his
Epistle to, That their sins were forgiven them, that is, of God, and not of
him, 1 Ioh. 2. 12. As Nathan said to David, 2 Samuel 1^. 13. Men cannot get the
pardon of their sins as they list, Act. 8. 22. Let men fear to sin against
God, least he say in his wrath, he will never forgive them, Ier. 14. 12. if
people were sure of a pardon when they have sinned, it were another matter; but
when they presume upon a pardon, and so sin, the Lord ^aith, he will
disapoint them, Deuteronomy. 2^. 19, 20.

Q. 165. Who (...) are the proper subjects, of forgiveness of sinne^ mean who
are they that this article belongs to?
A. Not all but many, Math. 26. 28. namely the remnant of Gods heritage, Mich.
7. 18. The city of God, those that dwell therein shall be forgiven their
iniquities, Isa. 33. 24. Indeed forgiveness of sin must be preached, in
Christ's name among all nations, Luke. 24. 47. according to the riches of his
grace, Ephesians. 1. 7. for Christ is the Lamb of God, that takes away the sins of
the world, John. 1. 29. the Gospel is to be propounded to every creature, and
it may so be* Mark. 16. 25. but if any would partake of the forgiveness of
sin. First, he must r^pentantly confess his sins. Job. 33. 27. Secondly,
he must be sensible of his spiritual captivity, for the acceptable year of
the Lord is for captives only, Luke 4. 18. 19. Thirdly, we must hungerly
attend upon upon God in all his ordinances: and take heed of wilful hardness
of heart least God take an order with him that he never b^ forgiven Mark. 4.
12. Fourthly, he must not only be baptized, but also with the Baptism of
repentance, Mark. 1. 4. Fifthly, he must give the godly good encouragement, that
they may co^fortably pray for him, Iam. 5. ^5. Sixthly, he must be a meek, and
a patient man to forgive such as trespass against him. Mark. 6. 14.

Q. 166. Who is the meritorious cause of forgiveness of sin?
A. Christ* in whom God reconcileth his people to himself, 2 Cor. 5. 19. for
their sins were laid upon him, Isa. 53. 5, 6. he is the true hyssope whereby
their sins are purged away* Psalm. ^1. 7. he is the fountain se^ open for
their uncleanness, Zach. 13. ^. he is the mediator of forgiveness, 1 Timothy 2.
5. not only by way of supplication, John. 17. 9. as Ioab and the woman of
Tekoah was to David for Absalom, 2 Samuel 14. 2. not only by way of intercession,
Heb. 7. 25. as Blastus to Herod for the Tyryans, Act. 12. 20. nor only by way
of satsfactioin, Heb. 12. 24. as Paul to Philemon for One simus, Phil. 18. but
also an advocate to plead it, and s^e it forth for them, ^ Ioh. 2. ^. Indeed
forgiveness of sin to us is an act of grace, if God take our sins, he does
it graciously, Hos. 14. 2. yet in regard that Christ has made satisfaction, it
is an act of justice, 1 1. 9. but first, our sins must be overwhelming
burdens to us, and we must be sinsible of our infinite need of a pardon, Isa.
40. 2. otherwise when we make mention of the mediator in our prayers, it is
not in truth, Isa. 48. 1. Secondly, we must be effectually called, Heb. 9. 15.
Thirdly, we must be in Christ, for pardon flows from union and being in
Christ, Col. 1. 14. the effect whereof is a new creature, 2 Cor. 5. 17. Christ
in one is the hope of glory, Col. 1. 17. Fourthly, we must have faith, Act. 13.
38, 39. we must behold the Lamb of God, John. 1. 29. A Mediator, is not a
mediator of one, but supposes two parties, and a consent on both sides, Gal.
3. 20. which is on Gods side, by giving of Christ, and on ours, by believing in
Christ, Job. 3. 16. and receiving of him by Faith, Ioh. 1. 12.

Q. 167. What are the comforts of forgiveness of sin.?
A. First, It is a comfort that there is such a thing, that when we have
sinned, propitiation is possible, 1 John. 2. 1. Secondly, that it is not only
possible, there being such a thing but that it may be applied unto us, if we
come to take it at Gods terms, 1 John. 1. 9. Thirdly, that it is universal
of all sins, Isa. 38. 17. and all kinds of sins, Exodus 34. 7. yea though
they be Scarlet sins, or Crimson sins, Isa. 1. 18. Fourthly, that it is
accompanied with the healing of sin too, Psalm. 103. 3. and the subduing and
killing of it, Mich. 7. 19. with the changing of ones mind and disposition,
and making him repent, that ever he committed it, Act. 5. 31. Fifthly, that
where the sin is forgiven, the punishment is forgiven also, and the man that
has it, may know his own salvation, Luke 1. 77. and therefore he may be of
good chere, Math. 9. 2. Sixthly, that where sin is once forgiven, it can
never return to be unforgiven, or to be laid to ones charge more, or remembered
against him any more, Ier. 31. 34. it is a debt quite blotted out, that can
never be demanded more, Isa. 43. 25. Indeed it may seem to return upon the
conscience, by doubtings and temptations and recidivation into sin again,
then the conscience may be soul again with it, and cry guilty a fresh, because
the man has blotted his evidence, and therefore he must pray for the renewing
of it again, Psalm. 32. 5. again a conceipted pardon may be repealed, as we
see by the debtor in the parable, Math. 18. 34. whom his master had seemed to
forgive, verse. 27. but that parable does not imply the repealing of any true
pardon, but only the constancy of that rule, that whosoever would have God to
forgive them, must forgive one another, Math. 6. 15. for when a man is forgiven
indeed, though afflictions come to seek out his sins, yet they shall not be
found, Ier. 50. 20.

Q. 168. Seeing God says, it is abominable to justify the wicked, Prove. 17.
15. What is the meaning then of the Apostle, who says, that God justifies the
ungodly, Romans 4. 5. will God do that which is abominable to him?
A. First, God may justify an ungodly man, and yet do it with righteous
judgment, he is the lawmakers, and therefore he may pardon what law-breakers
he will: because mercy and forgiveness belongs to him to dispense it where he
will, Dan. 9. 9. but if officers and Magistrates justify the wicked, they
sin: because they do it without warrant, for love, or for favor, or for
friends or for fear, or for reward, Isa. 5. 23. Secondly, God justifies no
other ungodly ones, but only his Elect; whose sins Christ died for, Romans 8.
33. 35. Thirdly, God can justify an ungodly man, because he can make him
godly, and purge his spirit from guile, Psalm. 32. 2. As he opens the eyes of
the blind, the man is not blind afterward, John 9. 25. The Lord never clears
any man, that goes on still in his guiltiness, E^^. 34. 7. and therefore it
is no act of injustice in God; whereas if a man should justify the wicked, it
is injustice in him, because he cannot make the man godly; and therefore he
must justify none but the righteous, and condemn none but the wicked, Deuteronomy.
25. 1. Fourthly, God justifies the ungodly, nor wallowers in sin and
undgodlinesse, but ungodly, that is formally so considered as sinners, 1 Timothy
1. 15. Now then is a man formally a sinner: when, First, he looks upon himself
as a sinner, when he sees his sins in there own colors, not ^ickled with
any righteousness of his own, Math. 9. 13. Secondly, when he carries
himself, so before God, in his looks and thoughts and affections, and mind,
as becomes a sinner in his case to do, Luke 18. 13. Thirdly, when his
impudence is gone, and confusion of face is put on, Dan. 9, 8. Fourthly, when
he has no squint lookings or any merits of congruities, or con^ignities, or
preparatives, or fitnesses, but magnifieth mercy, verse. 18. Fifthly, when he is
truly resolved upon turning to God, as abhorring the contrary to the pit of
hell. Isa. 55. 7. Sixthly, when a man is in truth willing to take up Christ's
cross, and follow him, Luke. ^. 23*

Q. 169. Seeing the Lord Jesus teaches us to pray plurally, forgive us our
sins, must we not pray that God would forgive other?
A. Yes, all that have wronged us, Act. 7. 6^. yea all that we have communion
with, 2 Chronicles. 30. 18. yea all that live in the Church, Exodus 32. ^1. and
others too, Genesis 20. 7. for first, we have a command for this duty, Iam. 5. 16.
Secondly, we have a promise of hope, of speeding, ver. 15. Thirdly, there have
been blessed effects of Gods servants prayers in this kind. Namely the Lord
has forgiven others upon their entreaty, Numb. 14. 20. Fourthly, we do our
selves good hereby, yea though God have a purpose to forgive one; yet sometimes
he stays till his servants entreat for him, Job. 42. 8. therefore first, we
should take notice of other men's sins, yea though they do not know they have
sinned, yet we would pray the Lord to forgive them in case they have, Job. 1.
5. Secondly we should beg one another prayers, 2 Thessalonians. 3. 1. Thirdly, we
should labor to be such as Gods people may have encouragment to pray for us,
as Paul was encouraged by the Ephesians faith and forwardness in the duty of
love, Ephesians. 1. 15. to pray for them verse. 16 for the good things that are to be
seen in us Phil. 1. 5. make them pray for us with joy ver 4. Though Simon Magus
entreated Peter to pray for him, yet having no encouragment, we do not read
that he did, or if he did, he could not do it with any confidence, Act. 8. 24.
again, First, let us pray for our selves, 2 King. 20. 1. if we would have
others to pray for us, verse. 4. Secondly, we must not dissemble with the
children of God when we pray them to pray for us, Ier. 42. 20. Thirdly, we must
not live in any known sin; least the Lord say to his people do not pray for
such; and to lock up their hearts, Ier. 7. 16. Fourthly, we must humble our
selves to them, if we have thought evil of them in our hearts Numb. 21. 7.
consider, First, if we be Saints, the cause may be such, that God will not
pardon us, except other Saints join, Deuteronomy. 9. 20. Secondly, the Saints of God
are marveilous willing to do it for us, 1 Samuel 12. 23.

Q. 170. Whereas our Savior teaches us to say; As we forgive them that
trespass against us? What is it to forgive one another?
A. It includes four things; first, to forbear one another, with holding our
selves from revenge, Col. 3. 15. which is no Pusillanimity, but a victorious
grace, Romans 12. 21. It is to overcome our selves, which is more then to take a
City, Prove. 16. 32. and to overcome the malice of our enemies, and to mollify
their hearts, 1 Samuel 24. 17. and to overcome the right way, which is by
Patience, and not by rendering quid for quo, Prove. 24. 29. Secondly, to root out
all desire of revenge, not only to tolerate for want of a handsome opportunity
to revenge, but to do it from the heart, Math. 18. 35. for it must be with
love, which proceeds not only from the heart; for so we see Drunkards will
forgive one another, but also from a pure heart, 1 Timothy 1. 5. Besides, we must
forgive and forget, when people say, I forgive, but I cannot forget; this is
silly forgiveness, like Ephraim, a silly Dove without heart, Hos. 7. 14.
Again, we must do it with earning bowels, as Joseph forgave his Brethren,
he wept and melted toward them, Genesis 50. 17. Thirdly, to be ready
notwithstanding to perform all offices of love, verse. 21. To bless them that
curse us, and to pray for them that spite us, Math. 5, 44. for God is good to
his enemies, verse. 45. and hereby we show, that he is our Father, verse. 48.
Publicans can love them, that love them, verse. 47. Besides, if that be all, we
have our reward, and can look for none from God, verse. 46. Fourthly, to
forgive universally all wrongs to our persons, Act. 7. 60. to our names, 2 Samuel
19. 23. and debts too, when the debtor is not able to pay, and yet submits,
Philem. 18. Nay, the greater the wrong is the greater is our glory to forgive,
Number. 12. 13.

Q. 171. Seeing a Soldier may kill his Enemy in a lawful war, and yet love
him, as far as the Law binds in such a case; so may a man go to law with his
Brother, without breach of Charity or of the duty of forgiving, when his ends
are right: Tell me then what these ends be, that may stand with love?
A. First, to demand ones right, when one is called to demand it, Luke 18. 3.
Now right is not contrary to love, but agreeable unto true judgment, Isa. 10.
2. Secondly, to amend and humble the party nocent; and therefore the Magistrate
is said to be a Minister for good, Romans 13. 4. Thirdly, that others may hear
and fear, and may not do the like, Deuteronomy. 19. 20. Fourthly, that the party
damnified, and others too, may live in peace; and this is the reason why we
should pray for Magistrates, 1 Timothy 2. 2. but provided; first, That it be done
in love, 1 Cor. 16. 14. and not with recompencing evil for evil, Romans 12. 17.
provided, secondly It be done without offense, 1 Cor. 6. 1. Provided, thirdly
The party wronging be able to make satisfaction, as for example in debts; for
if the party be not able, and yet submitts, it is cruelty to use the law
against such a one, 2 King. 4. 1. provided. Fourthly, that going to law, be our
last and utmost remedy, when people will presently go to law refusing to take
wrong or to be tried by private agreements, this is unchristian, 1 Cor. 6. 7.
provided Fifthly, that the wrong be not fit to be put up: in this case Paul
appeals to Caesar, Act. 25. 11. for as the Apostle say* in another case, so we
may say in this, the law is good if any man use it lawfully, 1 Timothy 1. 8.
private revenge is wretched. First, because vengeance is mine says God, Heb.
10. 30. and the Lord is the avenger, 1 Thessalonians 4. 6. Secondly wherefore serves
the Magistrate? he is ordained of God to punish evil doers* 1 Pet. 2. 14.
again. First, it is ones excellency to forgive* Mich. 7. 18. Secondly, it is
a note of a blessed man, Math. 5. 7. Thirdly, humane society cannot well be
without it; for we are apt to wrong others, and have need that they should
forgive us, and therefore we should be ready to forgive them, forgive and ye
shall be forgiven* Luk 6. 37. Fourthly, it is necessary to resist our wicked
heart, now not to forgive, proceeds from the wickedness of ones heart, Math.
18. 32.

Q. 172. What is the meaning of that As; as we forgive them their trespass
against us?
A. It does not signify a pattern or a rule, or direction as it does in the
third Petition, Math. 6. 10. for we would be glad that God would forgive us,
better then we can forgive one another. There be no works like unto his works,
Psalm. 86. 8. neither does it import that we can forgive one another, before God
has forgiven us, Math. 18. 32. for Gods forgiving of us, First, is an enabling
cause of our forgiveing one another, as Gods love to us, enables us to love
him, 1 John. 4. 19. Secondly, it is a motive cause too, Math. 18. 33. Thirdly,
it is evidenced unto us by our forgiving one another, as a cause by the effect,
Math. 6. 14. and yet we must, First, forgive one another, before we can
entreat the Lord to forgive us, Luke 11. 4. but this same as, does imply that
there must be a resemblance betvveen Gods forgiving of us, and our forgiving
one another, Ephesians. 4. 32. that is, First, we must frankly forgive, Luke. 7. 42.
Secondly, always, as often as we pray* Mark. 11. 25. which must be continually,
1 Thessalonians. 5. 17. ^ay though they be our enemies, and do not yet repent of their
wronging of us, Luke 23. 34. how much more if they do repent? Luke. 17. 3.
yea, we must forgive others, as Christ has forgiven us, what ever the quarrel
be, Col. 3. 13.

Q. 173. Why does our Savior teach us to pray, lead us not into temptetion
immediately after praying for the forgivnesses of our sins?
A. For two reasons. First, because forgiveness of sin and grevious
*temptations are inseparable companions* a true penitent person is most baited
by Satan, he needs not trouble impenitent persons, for he has them sure enough
already, and therefore commonly he lets them be quiet* Luke 11. 21. Sergius
Paulus no sooner believed, but the Devil stirred up Elimas against him, Act.
13. 8. when a man begines to turn unto God, the Devil suspects he is one of
Christ's seed, and therefore he labors to bruise his heel, that he may not go
on, Gen 3. 15. and to devour him, Rev. 12. 4. he has experience of prevailing
against diverse good, beginners, John. 6. 66* and Paul was afraid he had
prevailed against the Corinthians, 2 Cor. 11. 3. again, the special
providence is in it, to humble the soul; and therefore he made David ware,
before he would for give him, Psalm. 32. 3. and therefore it is a sign, when
people know not what grievous temptations means, the Devil holds them captive
at his will, 2 Timothy 2. 26. for he desires to ^ift all that have got out of his
clutches, Luke 22. 31. again when people are not smitten ^n conscience and
tempted, it is a sign the word does not work, for if it work, it cuts like a
sword, Heb. 4. 12. Secondly, because forgiveness of sin and yield to
temptations, cannot stand together, Cant. 5. 3. for, First, the grace of
forgiveness teaches a man not to yield to sin, Tit. 2. 11, 12. Secondly,
pardon of sin and grace not to go on in sin, are coupled together in the the
covenant of grace* Ier. 31. 33. Thirdly, they are coupled together in reason,
Psa. 41. 4. Fourthly, forgiveness, makes one love God, and so not to be
tempted away from him, Luke 7. 42. ^ay, Fifthly, God will not forgive nor
acquit upon other terms, but that we shall labor against temptations to sin,
Job. 10. 14. when we labor for forgiveness, except we mean to be godly, our
labor is in vain, Job. 9* ^9. God will not hear, Isa. 59. 2.

174. What is Temptation, and how many fold?
A. Temptation is a proof, Psalm. 95. 9. or a trial to see what is in one, or
what one will do, ^ Pet. 4. 12. temptations of different nature according as
it is used, sometimes good, Genesis 22. 1. sometimes bad* 1 Cor. 7, 5. First, God
is said to tempt, to try what is in a man's heart, Deuteronomy. 8. 2. what grace is in
a man* Psalm 105. 19. what corruption, 2 Chronicles. 32. 31. ^ay sometimes he tempts
a man* in his just judgment to sin, 2 Samuel 24. 1. this he does in a
righteous manner, for otherwise he cannot be said to tempt any, Iam. 1. 13.
properly it is a man's Just that does tempt him to sin, verse. 14. Secondly,
the Devil is said to tempt, Math. 4. 1. by putting motions into the heart,
John. 13. 2. by thrusting of importunate thoughts and itchings, which provoke
unto sin, 1 Chronicles. 21. 1. by presenting of objects before one, Luke. 4, 5.
and egging to take them, verse. 6. by setting a discouraging look upon ones
afflictions* 1 Thessalonians. 3. 5. by presenting occasions, Math. 4. 3. speaking in
the mouths of friends, Math. 16. 23. Thirdly, men are said to tempt too, John.
8. 6. First, they tempt God, either upon good ground to help their faith, Judge.
6. 37. and Ahaz sinned because he would not tempt God thus, Isa 7. 12. or in a
wicked wise, Act. 5. 9. as when a man distrusts God, and uses unwarrantable
means, Math. 4. 7. and when a man's sins in any other kind* 1 Cor. 10. 9.
either against God or his messengers, Exodus 17. 2. Secondly, men tempt
themselves either well, by a warrantable proving what is in them, 2 Cor. 13. 5.
or ill, by putting themselves upon danger Math. 26. 58. Thirdly, men tempt
others and that either well, to prove a brother, whether he be the man that he
seems, Rev. 2. 2. or ill, to draw him into sin, Genesis 39. 7. or
inconveniences, Math. 22. 18.

Q. 175. What is a temptation to sin?
A. There be four things that concur in it, First, it supposes
flexiblenesse in the party tempted, when the party is inticeable, Iam. 1. 14.
and therefore a frigide man cannot be tempted to a dultery; but one that has
lust in him, Math. 5. 28. the blessed Angels cannot be tempted to sin at all,
because they are confirmed in grace, and so was Christ as man too, and yet
there is an intrinseca^l flexiblenesse in every creature and in that respect
the best creature may be capable of a temptation, Math. 4. 1. but God is not at
all, Jam. 1. 13. Secondly, it supposes a bait to take the party with, Prove.
6. 25. when a man has some booty by ^in; either the getting of some seeming
good, as in allurements; as Judas got thirty peieces of silver, Math. 26. 15.
or prevention of some evil, as in temptations of fear or shame or the like,
Gal. 6. 12. when a man sins without a bait, he does not sin out of
temptation and therefore by his sin is the worse, Ezekiel. 16. 34. much more when
a man looses by his sin, Act. 23. 12. Thirdly, it supposes a trying what the
party will do, 2 Chronicles. 32. 3^. when a man lays abaite before on, as for
example a shilling or so in a corner, where a thevish servant may see it, and
conceive it was forgotten, to try whether he will steal it, as the Priests
offered the Soldiers money, to try whether they could get them to belie the
disciples of Christ, Math. 28. 12. Fourthly, it supposes a wickedminde, or
intention in the tempter, and therefore God cannot tempt any, Iam. 1. 13. but
the Devil, Math. 4. 1. or sinful men, such only tempt, Heb. 11. 37.
wherefore temptations are shrewd things to us, Gal. 6. 1* for* first, they may
move us to sin, though otherwise we would never have committed it, may be Jacob
would never have told a lie, but being tempted of his mother, he did, Genesis 27.
14. Secondly, they may move us to sin, when we have vowed and strongly purposed
not to yield; how many sins was David tempted and drawn to committ, and yet
he had sworn he would not, Psalm. 119. 106.

Q. 178. What use do you make of this, that temptations are so dangerous?
A. First, to teach us not to tempt any, Prove. 16. 29. Secondly, to be careful
we do not consent, when we are tempted, Prove. 1. 10. Thirdly, to keep our
heart withal diligence, Prove. 4. 23. for sin does easily be set us, and tempt
us, Heb. 21. 1. First, we must give the tempter a peremptory demall at first,
Math. 4. 10. Secondly, we must back our denialls with resistance, Iam. 4. 7.
Thirdly, and what though we have resisted again and again? we have not
resisted unto blood, Heb. 12. 4. and therefore we must continue resisting with
steadfastness, 1 Pet. 5. 9. Fourthly, we must look upon temptations as
warriers against our souls, that so we may abstain from yielding to them;
counting our selves strangers upon the earth, and such as have nothing to do
to be paddling in the world, Pet. 2. 11. Fifthly, we must give no advantage to
Satan, 2 Cor. 2* 11. neither by giving him matter, 1 Cor. 7. 5. nor occasion,
Gal. 5. 13. nor any pretense, Exodus 10. 26. nor by want of observing his hour,
Rev. 3. 10. nor by making provision for the flesh, Romans 13. 14. Sixthly, we
must take unto us the whole armor of God, Ephesians. 6. 13. knowing the Devil has
many wiles, verse. 11. having on us the girdle of truth, the breast-pla^e of
righteousness, verse. 14. the preparation of the Ghosple of peace, verse. 15.
the shield of says* verse. 16. the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the
spirit, verse. 17. praying with all prayer, verse. 18. and humbling our selves:
and in particular for our original corruption; David went to that, when he saw
he had bin tempted to adultery and murder, Psalm. 51. 5. keeping our selves to
vain company, Psalm. 119. 115. taking heed of melancholy, laboring to be
cheerful, Prove. 17. 22. not to be too solitary, Eccl. 4. 10.

Q. 179. Is a man naturally under the power of Temptation?
A. Yea, the flesh is too weak to resist it, Math. 26. 41. ands so is the
heart, Ezekiel. 16. 30. an enticing word is able to enforce us, Prove. 7. 21.
First, because our will is naturally strong set to the things of this life, as
ease, and credit and friends and riches, etc. 1 Timothy 6. 9. yea and to sin it
self* naturally we cannot cease from it, 2 Pet. 14. Secondly, because
naturally we do not love the commandments of God, nor any saving truth; and
therefore the least temptation that comes to draw us from it, is strong, 2 Thessalonians. 2. 10, 11. Thirdly, our minds naturally are without knowledge of the
danger, Prove. 9. 18. and therefore temptations are sweet to us, verse. 17. from
hence we may see, that woe is them that are in the flesh, because they are so
subject to please their own selves, that they cannot please God, Romans 8. 8.
again the Saints hence should labor to get their natures healed more and
more, because they have still some remainders of brutishness, whereby they are
subject to be tempted by sense, Psalm. 73. 22. signs of persons under the power
of temptation; sare first, to be usually stirred up by them, ^ King. 21. 25.
Secondly, when the Devil and his instruments can undertake to overcome them by
temptations, 1 King. 22. 21. Thirdly, when the Devil like a strong man can do
it with ease, without any a do, he can lead them hand* smooth, Luke 11. 21.
Fourthly, when they can endure the First, itchings of temptations without
rooting of them out, 2 Timothy 4. 3. Fifthly, when they can pray with ease, and
hear with ease, and be in company with ease, and alone with ease, they are not
put to it, whereas Paul went groaning up and down, Romans 7. 24.

Q. 180. Is it any excuse, to say we were tempted?
A. No, for first, the commandment calls for obedience, though we be never
so much tempted to disobey it; temptations do no^ weaken the bond of Gods law,
Prove. 1. 10. Secondly, the first lesson of the Gospel tells us, we are not
for Christ's turn, except we will deny all temptation, yea though self do
tempt self, Luke 9. 23. Thirdly, sin is of a damning nature though all the
temptations in the world concur to egg us to it, though fear, though shame
etc. Luke 9. 26. Fourthly, There Is no thank in that obedience, that we have no
temptations to draw us from, but blessed is he that endures temptation, Iam.
1. 12. Fifthly, what excuse can that be, when the very temptations themselves
come from our own lusting hearts, Iam. 1. 15. or else we put our selves upon
temptations, as first, by not marrying in the Lord, 1 King. 11. 4. Secondly, by
being idle and out of our callings, as David was upon the roof of his house, 2 Samuel 11. 2. Thirdly, by putting our selves upon dangerous callings; as keeping
of an Inn or an Alehouse, in this case we should say as Christ said, who made
me a judge? Luke 12. 14. Fourthly, by going about actions without warrant, as
Dinah, Gene. 24. 1. or by being in tempting places, without ground as Peter,
Mat. 26. 69. Fifthly, by not keeping the communion of Saints, when we may; what
tempted Thomas to unbelief, but his absence from the society of his fellow
Apostles? John. 20. 24. Sixthly, by doing that which another may lawfully do,
yet as things stand, we may not lawfully do it, Abraham might look toward
Sodom, Genesis 19. 28. but Lot might not* verse. 17. God does not forbid every
man the coming near the house of a whore, for some can go close by her door
without any temptation to go in, but some he does, Prove. 5. 8. but if a man
have a calling to astation full of temptations he is in Gods way, which is
strength to the upright, Prove. 10. 29. the Angels take charge of the Saints,
while they are in their way, Psalm. 91. 11. Though Ahabs house were a house full
of temptations, yet Obadiah having a calling to be there; feared the Lord
greatly, 1 King. 18. 3.

Q. 181. What does God permit men to be tempted?
A. That he does permit men to be tempted, is plain in the example of Eve, 2
Cor. 11. 3. and of Hezekiah, 2 Chronicles. 32. 31. and specially of the wicked, Act.
14. 16. and the reasons are, first, because he is not bound to keep men from
being tempted, he made man upright, Eccl. 7. 29. Secondly, because he may
justly do so, seeing men have sinned against him; as when Israel had spared
the Canaa^ites contrary to his command he left them to be tempted by them,
Judge. 3. 1. Christ left Peter to be tempted by a damsel, for he presumed of
his strength. Math. 26. 33. and therefore, First, let us pray, Lord leave us
not, Psalm. 27. 9. if we be foiled at any time, we may thank our own selves, for
he has made us a promise, not to suffer us to be tempted, above what we are
able, 1 Cor. 10. 13. and therefore we wrong our own souls, if we do not fly
to it, and sue it forth, for if we be his, he has said, he will not suffer our
foot to be moved, Psalm. 121. 8. again Secondly, let us watch, Math. 26. 41.
if he do but leave us to be tempted, and to grapple with temptation, we are
gone, if he should but suffer our feet to slip, they will slip for certain,
and therefore let us watch toward him, who has said, he will not suffer them,
Psalm. 66. 9. Thirdly, let us beware lest we provoke God to permit us to
temptation, let us take heed we be not joined to a lust, for then God will say,
let them alone, Hos. 4. 17. Fourthly, this is a comfort, that we cannot be
tempted, except God permit, No, not by Satan, Job 1. 12. God has Satan in a
chainee Job 2. 6. he can do nothing except Christ giv him leave, Mark 5.

Q. 182. How shall we know, whether a temptation fl^w from our selves or from
Satan?
A. This question is somewhat dangerons, for any evil* yea Blasphemy it self
may proceed from our own heart Mark. 21. 22. and yet it is some sign it is
from Satan; first, when a man is tempted to that which he is naturally averse
from Math. 4. 6. Secondly, when the temptation is sudden, like a flash of
lightning, Luke 4. 5 Thirdly, when the temptation comes without any coherence
with that which one was thinking upon, Satan ears not what he molesteth one
with, for he stands at ones right hand there ready for the nonce, Zach. 3. 1.
Fourthly, when a temptation is in a hurrying manner, skipping from one thing to
another, when it is with importunity, like summer Flies upon a sore, or a
Bald-head: when it is as though it would never a done, Luke 4. 2. Fifthly, when
it is with the delusion of the senses, Math. 4. 8. Now the way to beat the
Devil off, is not to rail at him, Jude 9. but first by Faith, 1 Pet. 5. 9.
Not by a naked quoting of Scripture; for he will quote Scripture himself, and
put a false gloss upon the same, Luke 4. 10. but secondly, by so quoting it as
to cleave by obedience unto it, verse. 12. not by making of crosses on our
breast* for how can that drive him away, when Christ's own bodily presence did
not fear him away? verse. 9. but thirdly, by a stout and peremptory detestation
of his motions, to abandon him, verse. 8. and fourthly, by considering that
Christ was in all points tempted as we are, sin only excepted, Heb. 4. 15.
and fifthly, though the Devil can find a great deal of matter for him in us,
yet he could find nothing in Christ* Ioh. 14. 30. Sixthly, by looking at the end
that the Lord will make, Iam. 5. 11. for though Satan be not under our feet
yet, he shortly shall Romans 16. 20.

Q. 183. Whether do these two clauses, Lead us not into temptation but deliver
us from all evil; make but one Petition?
A. First, it matters not much, whether they make but one or no; for it is a
sign of Pride to strive about words, 1 Timothy 6. 4. Secondly, it is more likely
that they make but one Petition, and that is, as our Savior sums both these
clauses up in one, that our heavenly Father would keep us from the evil, Ioh.
17. 15. For first, the one clause is Negative, and the other is Affirmative;
now the Negative and Affirmative make but one truth. As we see in this passage.
Thou shall dye and not live, Isa. 38. 1. Secondly, our Savior does not put
them down copulatively, Lead us not into temptation, and deliver us from
evil; for then they might have some color of being two, but he unites them
with a But, as though the first were not a whole Petition without the second,
Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from ^^ill, Luke 11. 4. Thirdly, it
is enough to say, it is one Petition consisting of two parts. The one for
preventing Grace, to prevent us from falling into evil, the other for
recovering Grace; that at the furthest, if we fall into evil, yet how soever,
the Lord would deliver us out, according to that of the Psalmist, Psalm. 37. 24.
Fourthly that conceit of the Papists to make seven Petitions in the Lords
Prayer, according to the number of the seven Graces of the Spirit, is but
frothy, for there be many more graces of the Spirit. His grace is manifold, 1
Pet. 4. 10.

Q. 184. Because this last clause shows that we are naturally under the power
of evil, whereof the Devil is the Captain; show me then how that natural
men are under the Power of the Devil?
A. He has his Shop-house in all the children of disobedience, and he works
in them, Ephesians. 2. 2. yea, he reigns and rules in them; for the Devil has
his Kingdom, and in whom has he it, if not in them, Math. 12. 26. For first,
the Lord the just Judge turns them over to the Devil, because they will not
be ruled by him; therefore the Devil shall have them, to rule over them; yea
he shall be their God, though they be blind and see no such thing, 2 Cor. 4. 4.
and he gives the Devil charge over them, as he gives the good Angels charge
over the godly, Psalm. 91. 11. Secondly, because the Devil can find none that
will do his works, but only them, Ioh. 8. 44. and therefore great is their
misery; for first, they are his Slaves, and he holds them captive at his will,
2 Timothy ^. 26. Secondly, they are so tyrannized over and kept under by him, that
he will not let them look after Heaven, or any good to any purpose, he does
oppress them, Acts 10. 38. Thirdly, he has power over their death, that they
shall never dye; well though they seem to dye never so well, Heb. 2. 14.
Fourthly, he leads them, though they little think it, he that Lies, little
thinks he, that the Devil fills his heart, and yet he does, Acts 5. 3.
Idle persons and ^atlers, 1 Timothy 5. 13. little think they, that they turn
after Satan; and yet they do verse. 15. he that commits sin, little
thinks he, that he is of the Devil, and yet he is, 1 Ioh. 3. 8. enemies of
righteousness, they little think, that they are the children of the Devil,
and yet they all be, Acts 13. 10. For first, the Devil is a Spirit; and
therefore he can be in the wicked, and they never spy it, Revel. 16. 14.
Secondly, he can transform himself into an Angel of light; and therefore he
can make them believe, he is a good Spirit, 2 Cor. 11. 14.

Q. 185. Are there no more evils that we have need to be delivered from?
A. Yes, the whole world is sull of evils, Ioh. 17. 15. we can walk in no way
but there be many evils attending upon it to defile us, and happy is he that
is undefiled with them, Psalm. 119. 1. We can not tread one step, but there be
evils ready to have dominion over us, except the Lord deliver us, therefrom,
verse. 133. First, in our outward Callings, as we are in danger in being
overmuch, or not enough in them, of savouring them too much; so that we cannot
savor the Word, the Sacraments, and Sabboths, for fleshly fear and distrust,
grasping too many things, Improvidence, hampering our selves with the wicked;
so that happy is he whose God is the Lord, for he is faithful to keep one
from the evil, 2 Thessalonians. 3. 3. Secondly, in Prosperity, we are apt to think
we shall dye in our nest, Job 29, 18. hoping it will not end yet nor yet, we
are apt to be vain and delicare, and tender, and unhardy, to forget the
afflictions of Joseph, to be selfe-confident, to prize heaven the less, to be
the un^i^ter for humiliation and the other irksome duties of Mortification;
such evils wise Ag^^ saw in being full, Prove. 30. 9. Thirdly, in ^ity to be
impatient, discontented, to be moping, to use unlawful means, to be
Pu^illanimous and base, to be dead to good things; David himself in his
affliction found a want of quickening, Psalm. 119. 107. Fourthly, in our eating
and drinking, as the Israelites minds ran upon their Onyo^s and Garlic, and
fleshpots their soul loathed the Manna; when we drink we are ready to be
caught with the redness of the Wine, when we eat as Esau with the redness of
the Pottage, at Feasts we are subject to forget fear, we are in danger of
Intem. perance, curiosity, pleasure; and therefore blessed is he that has
Faith in Gods word to Pray that his meat may be sanctified, 1 Timothy 4. 5.
Fifthly, in our delights and recreations, to be too ^esting, and light, and
tickeled, immoderate, unseasonable, over long, to be un^itted thereby to graver
and seriouser things, which are great evils; for they do exceedingly dead us
toward Christ, 1 Timothy 5. 6. Sixthly, in our company to be infected some way or
other, and carried away, Gal. 2. 13. Seventhly, when we are alone, Eccl. 4.
10. though the more Grace we have, the less we are alone, when we are alone,
Ioh. 16. 32. Eighthly, when we are about godly duties, there ^^ evils about us
too, and therefore we had need ^o take heed, Luke 8. 18.

Q. 186. It appears then God is the only de^^erer?
A. Yea, Psalm. 70. 5. for first, he is strong e^ough, Kings and Princes are not
able to be deliverers, 2 King. 6. 27. he only is our rock; and therefore our
only deliverer, 2 Samuel 22. 2. Secondly, in him only we may trust for
deliverance; Psalm. 144. 2. and therefore, First, we should ^ly only to him for
deliverance, Psalm. 50. 15. Secondly, this condemns them that ^ly to any other
for deliverance, it is a heavy curse when a man is given up to such a reprobate
sense, as to go any where else, Judge. 10. 14. Thirdly, if we be delivesed at
any time, let us take notice that our deliverance comes from him; and let him
have a song of Praise, Psalm. 32. 7. Fourthly, let us labor to be such, as he
may be willing to deliver, as First, let us see our selves utterly undone
without him 2 Chronicles. 20. 12. Secondly, let us climb up to mount Sion;
deliverance dwells there, Joel. 1. 32. Thirdly, let us set our selves to be
holy. ^^ad. 17. Fourthly, let us be importunate with God not to tarry long
before he deliver, Psalm. 40. 17. and yet Fifthly, wait too, till he is pleased
to deliver, Lam. 3. 26. Sixthly, let us look to the Holy one. Isa. 31. 1.
Seventhly, if any deliverance be offered any other way; let us not except it.
Heb. 11. 35. the Lord does deliver. First, by keeping away the evil, Job. 33.
17. Secondly, by removing it a way when it is come, Psalm. 51. 14. Thirdly, by
disanulling the force of the evil. Dan. 3. 27. or the hurtfulnesse of it,
Mark. 16. 18. Fourthly, by altering of the nature of it, and turning it to
good, Genesis 15. 20. Fifthly, by taking one away from the evil, 2 King. 22. 20.
which few men do consider, Isa. 57. 1. and therefore, first, God has more
ways to deliver his people then one Deliverances, Psalm. 44. 4. Secondly,
though never so many ways of Deliverance be blockt up yet let Faith say, God
has another way yet, Ester 4. 14. for God is skillful and well verst in
delivering his, 2 Pet. 2. 9. Thirdly, let our faith be indifferent; may be God
will be with us in trouble and that is a deliverance, Psalm. 9. 15. may be God
will keep us in it, and that is a deliverence, Psalm. 25. 20. may be he will
keep us from sinking, and that is a deliverance too, Psalm. 69. 14.

Q. 187. What do you learn from these words; For thine is the Kingdom, the
Power, and the glory?
A. That Prayer is to be pressed with arguments, as Moses his Prayer was, Exodus
32. 11, 12, 13. so was Asa's, 2 Chronicles. 14. 11. First, because God is a God of
infinite understanding, and therefore when we speak unto him, we had need to
speak reason, Job 13. 3. Secondly, because Prayer is a pleading, which must be
full of good reasons, Job 23. 4. Thirdly, because Prayer is a main part of Gods
service, which is reasonable, Romans 12. 1. for even a mortal man stands much
upon reason, Job 32. 11. much less has the wise God delight in fools. Eccl.
5. 4. Therefore first, we should well ponder our Prayers, before we do pray
them. David calls his Prayers his meditations, Psalm. 5. 1. we must ponder upon
what ground we come to God, otherwise he will send us away without hearing,
Judge. 10. 14. we must ponder what correspondency we have with him is otherwise
he will indite us of impudence, for ou^ coming into his Courts, Ier. 11. 15.
when we Pray to him rightly, God says, Come let us reason together, Isa. 1.
18. Secondly, hence we see that wicked men, be they never so learned, and
gifted in Prayer, yet they cannot Pray, for lack of Spiritual reason, they
are unreasonable men, 2 These. 3. 2. This is a comfort to good Christians, that
have the Lords attributes all on their side, for God will be sure to hear
such, Ioh. 9. 31. hence it is that they do not faint in Prayer, as others do;
because their reasons are never exhaust, they have still more and more reason,
Luke 18. 1. 7. Jacob had such reasons that he would not let the Lord go, Genesis
32. 26. The Prophet Isaiahs his mouth could never be stopped, he had still more
and more to say, and press the Lord with, Isa. 62. 1^ and therefore, first,
when we have a good argument, we should lie a tugging with it, and follow it
hard, as Joshua did, Josh. 7. 6. 9. Secondly, when our arguments seem to be
answered, we should recover them again, Math. 15. 22, 23, 24.
