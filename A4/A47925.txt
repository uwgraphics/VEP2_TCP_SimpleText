To the Reverend Dr. Thomas Ken.
Feb. 1. New Style, 1680. SIR,
IN or about October last, Mr. Oats represented Me to the King and Council for
a Papist; Prance swore, that he saw me several times at Mass at
Somerset House, about two years before; But swore withal, that he never see me
receive the Sacrament: I was Summoned, Heard, and Acquitted.

Since that time, Some People (as I am informed) have Sworn, that they have
seen me Receive too; wherein I think my self bound in Conscience and Common
Prudence to clear my Self.

Sir, By the Grace of God I purpose to Receive the Blessed Sacrament from your
Hand, to morrow; May it be Life or Death to me as I speak true or false; May it
be to me what the Sop was to Judas, if either I am, or ever was, or ever
pretended to be of the Communion of the Church of Rome.

I never Received the Sacrament from a Romish Priest in my Life; I never was
under the Roof of a Popish Chapel in England, since the King was Restored in
1660. I have no Reserve, but intend by this Letter, as I desire you may
understand it.

Sir, I am with infinite Reverence for your Function and Esteem for your
Friendship and Person,

Your most affectionate humble Servant, Roger L'Estrange.


L'Estrange Received the Sacrament accordingly, Sir Gabriel Sylvius, Mr. Plot,
Mr. Sidney's Secretary, Mr. Blagrave Chaplain to the Princess, Received at the
same time.
