December. 6. 1708. Advertisement to Booksellers, and others.
WHereas there has been a Book lately Printed and Published, Entitled, The
Neat Duties (All Discounts and Abatements Deducted) of all Merchandise
Specified in the Book of Rates, Begun in the 12th Car. II. With the several
Variations to this present Year 1708. The said Book has, upon Examination,
been found very Erroneous and False in the Duties of Goods Imported and
Exported, and in the Draw-backs, besides several Omissions. This is to give
Notice, That there is Preparing for the Press, and will speedily be Published
at Her Majesty's Printing-Office in Blackfriars, A Book of all the Neat Duties
upon Merchandise both Inwards and Outward, in Tables Decimal and Vulgar, with
several other very Useful Tables; and will be Sold at a very Reasonable Price
at the Place aforesaid, and at most Booksellers. All such Books or Tables as
are Deduced from Acts of Parliament, being the undoubted Propriety of Her
Majesty's Printers.
