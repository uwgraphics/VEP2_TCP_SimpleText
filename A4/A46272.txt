SELF; OR, A RIDDLE, Called the MONSTER.
By T. I.
RIddle my Riddle (for I mean to pose ye)
What is it Raises ye, Yet Overthrows ye?
What is it That makes Men deny to pay Tribute?
Soar to a Septer, yet sink to a Iibbet?
What makes Disputants keep such a puther,
Shutting the Gates of Bliss, One against the other?
What is it makes a Man (by Toil and Labor,
With all the wit he can) to Cheat his Neighbor?
Least this Enigma should too much involue Yey,
Extend your Intellect, I shall resolve Ye:
SELF is that Monster, which swallows up All-things;
Makes low things, high things, brings great things, to small things.
SELF has his Sov'raignty (more is the pity)
In Church, Court, Country, Camp, Navy, and City.
What e're the Voyage be, SELF has the Venture;
Where e're the Circle be, SELF is the Center.
SELF in this season, is the only Object;
SELF is a Sovereign, and SELF is a Subject:
SELF is a Stats-man, that pleads for Applauses,
SELF would be Chancelour in his own Causes.
SELF, into every Species can vary,
SELF's Eccleastical, and Military:
SELF will be meddling with Kingdoms, and Crowns too,
SELF can build Houses, and SELF can sell Towns too.
SELF, once raised War, between Swede and Poland,
And betwixt England, France, Denmark, and Holland:
SELF has a Seigniory in every Region,
SELF is of any, and of no Religion:
SELF is a Self-seeker, and SELF is a Shaker;
SELF is a Prpist, and SELF is a Quaker:
SELF makes a Protestant some times to falter,
And bids a Prisbiter, bow to the Alter.
SELF hatched the War, and the fatal Infection:
SELF set the City in flameing distraction,
SELF was the Plotter, SELF was Prejector,
SELF was the sufferer, and SELF was the Actor:
SELF was the Fire-ball, that brought with it is flashes,
Englangs Metropolis, to Dust and Ashes:
SELF was a Thing made such work for Repayers,
Which scarce will be finished, by Him or his Heirs.
SELF was a Person (though not very witty)
Which in that season, was Spark of the City.
SELF is a Serpent, whose intreges are Oblick:
SELF is the ruin of every Republic:
SELF is the motive, so many are un-done,
SELF was the Burning and Downfall of London;
Though SELF (in confidence) thought He was able
To quench the fury on it, with his small Babble.
SELF is a Courtier that seems to adore ye,
And spreads his formal fine saviors before ye,
But if your Suit at Court, have not some pelf in it,
(...) there was Self in it.
SELF is a Countryman, when fire enforces
Men to make use of his Wagons and Horses;
When Goods and Money were shared in four Quarters,
By Fire, and by Fellons, by Traitors, and Carters.
SELF was a Traiton, a Turncoat, a Teacher:
SELF, and Pluerallities, makes up a Preacher.
SELF is a Shopkeeper, One that will ply ye,
With see what ye lack Sir; But gets nothing by ye:
SELF is so many Things, no Man can name all:
SELF 's an Hermaphrodite, both Male and Fenale.
SELF in a Woman's the root of all Evil,
And gives cause to say, SELF is a Devil.
SELF do Self-have, is a severe old Sentence;
And SELF does daily make work for Repentince.
Let him be Englishman, Spaniard, or Roman,
When each Man's for himself, then God is for no Man:
And you shall find it true (if well you pause on it)
What Michiefs e're enfue, SELF is the Cause on it:
SELF is an inlet to every Disaster:
He that denies him-SELF, is his own Master.
FINIS.
