A LOYAL VOTE FOR THE HAPPY BIRTH AND Prosperity of the Expected Royal Issue.
Jam Nova Progenies Coelo demittitur alto,
Chara Deum Soboles, etc. --
Virgil Eclog. IV.
BRING Flowers, ye Muses, and ye Graces too,
Fresh as your Beauties, sweet as Nectar-Dew,
TO adorn the Royal Bed, whence shortly springs
The Destined Father of Ten Thousand Kings.
It Is so! The STVARTS High Genius, that never failed
For seven long Ages yet, has now prevailed:
And in the Adamantine Books of Fate,
Another numerous Chain of MALES is set.
A God-like Soul long-since from Heaven did come
TO inform the Burden of the Growing Womb:
The Tender Limbs Beauties and Graces Mould,
And Life's dear Knot an Angel's Hand does hold.
Post on, swift Time, Post on thy Golden Hours
To Bless the World with this Dear Joy of Ours;
And Thou, for whose kind Birth three Kingdoms pray,
Make Haste, sweet PRINCE, and don't our Hopes delay.
As all the World did heretofore Depend
On that Great Lord, whom Heaven had sworn to send:
Him Pious Prophets gladly did Foretell;
With his high Praise the Sibylls Leaves did swell;
The Saints for his Approach expecting stood,
And Courted God for the Universal Good:
So for thy Birth (blessed Infant) we do long;
And Three great Nations to their Temples throng,
Already made Thy Votaries! -- The Year
Puts on fresh Garments and does Young appear
At thine Approach. The teeming Earth, it seems,
Prepares young Flowers to Welcome her Young JAMES,
The Seas, which once must crowch to his Sceptered Hand,
Now swell with Joy, and Dance about the Land:
Sirens and Tritons on the Surface leap,
And with their Songs charm the unweldy Deep.
But Heaven a wondrous Star intends to Frame
TO attend the Babe, and signify his Fame,
Greater than that, which o'r his Uncle shined,
When Him a Blessing Fate for Us Designed.
Lucina by the Royal Bed does stand
Prepared to lend her kind, assisting Hand
At the bright Hour: When the Planets shall dispense
Their fullest and most Gracious Influence
On his Auspicious Horoscope. And see!
How Sacred Majesty on bended Knee
Waits by to Kiss Great WALES's PRINCELY Pride,
With Fame, and Wealth, and Honor by her Side.
Prophetic smiles dance on his FATHER'S brow,
To whom his Realms with Thankful Hearts do bow
For all the Mighty, Gracious Acts He Is done,
And after all, for giving such a Son.
O, might I purchase of the Gods this Grace,
To have my Vital Line drawn out the space,
Which to his Manhood Heaven has now designed;
When the Adoring World this Prince shall find
Mature, and filling his Great FATHER'S Throne,
Crowned with his FATHER'S Virtues and his Own!
That I my Fame might on his Glorys raise,
And purchase Heaven by sounding forth his Praise!
Not the Maeonian Bard, nor Mantuan Swan
Should me surpass! For sure this God-like Man
With sinewy Verse my weaker Muse would fill;
And his great Acts invigorate my Quill.
Make Haste, Dear Prince, and don't our Hopes delay!
For thy blessed Birth Three spacious Kingdoms Pray.
FINIS.
