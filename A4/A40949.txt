THE SAINTS DUTY, and SAFETY, In a Trying Time, And when they are attended with
a Suffering Condition: OR, The Saints Duty in Meeting Together in the Way of
God, as Worshippers of him; and their Safety and Happiness in continuing and
abiding with the Lord in that wherein the Lord has appeared, and does continue
and abide with them, to minister unto them both in a Time of Suffering, and in
a Time of Rejoicing.

And also, The Danger of being negligent in Meeting together, to perperform
their Duty and Service to God, through any wile, and crafty mysterious working
of Satan, whereby he labors to seduce and deceive them, etc,

Written in the 4. Month, 1664. by R. F. To be read amongst Friends at their
Meetings, and upon occasins, to such as there may be a Service,

London, Printed in the Year, 1664.

The Saints Duty, and Safety in a Trying time, and when they are attended with
a suffering Condition, etc.
IT is a duty to meet together in the way of God as worshipers of him, and it
is a danger to be negligent in that Respect, therefore let us hold fast the
profession of our faith without wavering, and let us consider one another, to
provoke unto Love, and to good works, not forsaking the assembling of our
selves together, as the manner of some is, but exhorting one another, and so
much the more as ye see the day approaching, for if we sin wilfully after we
have received the knowledge of the truth, Thereremaineth no more sacrifice for
sins, but a certain fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery indignation,
which shall devour the adversaries. Heb 10.23, 24, 25, 26, 27.

It was the manner of some in the Primative Time to be negligent in assembling
and meeting together with the people of God, under the Gospel dispensation, and
when they did wilfully neglect that duty either out of prejudice against them
that continued faithful in a Godly exercise, or to flee the Cross so as to
grow secure and careless, or else to avoid a suffering condition, It was
accounted all one with the sin of presumption, by sinning not ignorantly but
wilfully, and that after they had received the knowledge of the Truth, and as
it was dangerous, so to do then, it is as unsafe and dangerous to sollow the
like example, and be so negligent now.

But perhaps some may think, it will be the way to avoid a great danger, and be
for their saftey now to neglect assembling and meeting with the people of God,
in a way differing from the worship of the world, to the number of five or
above, because they are prohibited by the Law of the Land under great penalties
to meet upon the account of Religion, and worship of God, as aforesaid Contrary
to the Liturgy or practice of the Church of England.

To such I answer, Art thou truly acquainted with God, has he appeared in
Spirit unto thee, and called the out of the way and worship of the world, and
called thee into the way and worship of God, and have thou obeyed the call of
the Lord, art thou departed accordingly out of the way and worship of the
world, and art thou admitted of, and entered into the spiritual way and worship
of God, how was it with thee before thou left the one, and come into the other,
was not God angry with thee, when thou offered to tarry and stay behind in the
way and worship of the world, after he had discovered it unto thee, and called
thee to come out of the same, and did not he by his good Spirit, testify
against thee for so doing; moreover, did not the Lord pursue thee, and
withstand or beat down the carnal reasonings and gainsayings of thy heart, and
make thou weary until thou did depart and come out thereof; if so, was it
not the Lords own doing? and did not thou own and confess it so to be, as
first to unvail thy veiled heart; and secondly to discover unto thee the spirit
of error, and what it had led thee into; and thirdly to advise and persuade
thee to come out thereof, and also to forsake the way and worship of the world,
That thou might be admitted into the way and worship of God: and did not the
Lord in making known himself unto thee, make known his worship, and either
answer or beat down the fleshly objections and gainsayings of thy heart, and
call thee and guide thee into his own pure worship in spirit, John. 4.23.24.
and afterward signify unto thee, how he owned the same, and thee as thou
did abide and continue therein; if so, what cause have thou to desert him, or
offer to depart from him and his worship again, for fear of an outward
suffering from men, or have thou any toleration from God so to do? consider
well of it, and let the Lord judge in this case, as doubtless he will, for he
has not called thee out of the way and worship of the world, into the way and
worship of God, to allow of thee, to forsake him in a suffering time, so as to
forsake the Lord and his worship, to comply and join with that spirit and
worship of the world which he has called thee from, neither will he tolerate
and juflifie thee therein, but rather condemn and severely punish theefor so
doing.

To Sin wilfully after the knowledge of the Truth, by forsaking the Assemblies
of the people of God when they are forbidden by men, Heb. 10.23, 24, 25, 26,
27, 28, 29, 30, 31.
to avoid an outward danger or suffering from them, is not the way to safety
and happiness, (in a way that God does own,) but is the way rather to
everlasting misery and ruin, by turning the Lord against them, 2 These. 1.5, 6,
7, 8, 9.
therefore, how does it concern all that offer to decline from the truth,
rightly beforehand to consider what they are doing, and to be advised and take
warning in time, so as to mind their continuation, and standing in the Truth,
and upon the sure and certain foundation, 2 Timothy 2.19.

And since you received the Truth have you not had many persuasions within and
without, 2. Tet. 2.4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Phil. 1.29. 2 Timothy 3.12.
to forsake it again because it is attended with a suffering condition; but
know this assuredly, that when you are persuaded either without or within from
the way and worship of God in Spirit which he has called you into, and does
own, to depart and go back again, into that which God has called you from,
that such persuasions comes not of God who has called you, and therefore you
may justly deny them, for there were some in the primative Time, that once did
run well, and were afterward hindered, that they should not obey the Truth; but
such a persuasion did not come of him that had called them, as by the Scripture
is evident and plain, Gal. 5.7, 8.

The Apostle of Christ did account it a kind of witchcraft, to be seduced and
drawn from the Truth, and is it any better now. That it was so then is apparent
and evident, Gal. 2.1.
for said he, O foolish Galatians who has bewitched you, that you should not
obey the Truth. Gal. 2.3.
Are ye so foolish having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the
flesh, it is a kind of witchcrast and great folly indeed, for a people that
have begun in the Spirit, to depart and go back again into the flesh, to have
known the Truth, and true way of the Lord, and been obedient and subject
thereunto; Romans 3.122.
and afterward to disobey the Truth, and depart from the way of the Lord, into
the way and worship of the Spirit of the world, 2 Timothy 3.3.4.
to leave a certain thing for an uncertain, to leave the everlasting Truth, to
follow Error and Fables, to leave the best for the worst, to forsake that
which God does own, to follow that which he has called from, to leave that
which is attended with blessings and happiness from God, to follow that which
is attended with misery and wrath, from the Lord, is folly indeed, and below
the Spirit and wisdom of God; and indeed it is no point of true wisdom, or
any part of a wise man, endued with the wisdom of God, So to do.

Have thou not been acquained with the teachings of God, in the way of the
Spirit of the Lord, and did not the Spirit of God in its teachings and
leadings, both teach thee and lead thee, to the knowledge of a people, both
taught and owned of the Lord, to meet with them in point of Religion and
worship of God, and give thee many refreshings and testimonies from his own
life, to enjoin and encourage thee therein to abide and continue with the Lord
and his people in the way of his teaching and worship as aforesaid.

And as thou have bin acquainted with the teachings of God, have thou not also
been acquainted with the teachings of the enemy of God, under pretense of a
Friend did Satan never yet transform himself like to an Angel of Light, to
labor to bewitch thy mind, by insinuations, and crafty mysterious workings, to
seduce and withdraw thy heart from God, and to labor to cause thee to disobey
the known truth of the Lord; wherein the Lord appeared unto thee, and gave thee
many Testimonies of his Love, and enjoined thee therein to walk, and did thou
not with purpose of heart, and godly resolution, intend and signify thy
intentions to the Lord, that thou had a purpose of heart to continue therein,
until the enemy by insinuation, and crafty mysterious workings, did somewhat
change thy purpose of heart, and began to altar thy godly resolutions, did not
the enemy of thy soul come craftily, and after a mysterious manner, and say,
what do not thou own the teaching of God, and art not thou taught of the
Lord, and very sensible thereof: and did not thou in simplicity answer and
say, yes, it is so, I cannot deny it; did not the enemy reply then and say unto
thee, seeing thou art taught of the Lord, and art sensible of his Teachings, as
thou art alone by thy self, and when thou art on thy bed, and as thou walk
up and down, and art about thy occasions, and has such sweet refreshings from
him, what needst thou to go hither and thither to Meetings, and to expose thy
self to hazards and dangers? and was there not a fleshly easeful part in thee
ready to hearken, and be inclineable to the secret Teachings of the Enemy, and
account them as Divine Oracles, or Sayings of God? and was not thou ready to
have changed thy former Purposes, and godly resolutions, and say, what should I
go to Meetings for? seeing I am so acquainted with Divine Teachings, at home
and abroad, and do find the Lords refreshing presence to attend and accompany
me as I do, will not my going to Meetings, and continuing faithful to the Lord
therein, as I have purposed, make the thing customary and bring it up into a
form, by so doing; is it not better therefore for me, and my safety to absent
there from, and keep closse with the Lord at home, and not go to Meetings, did
not the Lord Pursue the Enemy, and search out and discover unto thee the depth
of that wile and crafty mysterious working of Satan, and teach thee that thou
art not to deny thy duty to God, and the continuation and abiding with the
Lord, in what he makes known unto thee, and wherein he enjoynes thee to walk,
and with him to abide, under the denominations of Formality and Customarinesse
as the Enemy under pretense of a Friend would persuade thee, and when thou have
been made sensible of the Love of God, in discovering the wiles of the Enemy,
and the danger which he labored to lead thee into, and were preserved and kept
out of the same, how did thou then prize his Love, and walk humbly before the
Lord, and as thou did continue with him, and abide faithful unto him, did
not thou meet with some or other that the Enemy had possessed with that wile, and
crafty working of Satan, which God preserved and kept thee out of, as
aforesaid; and did not they into whom Satan had so entered and possessed with that
wile and mysterious working, endeavor to hold it out to thee, as some new
discovery, and when thou could not own or entertain the same as an Oracle, or
saying of God, but withstood the same, and declared against it as a delusion of
Satan, did not prejudice appear (as a work of the enemy) in such an instrument
against thee for so doing, and was not he ready to judge thee to be formal and
customary because of thy stedfastness unto the Doctrine of the tried Truth, and
for thy continuation and abiding with the Lord in that wherein he appears
unto thee, owns thee in, gives thee many Testimonies of his love, and enjoins
thee to walk, as a true subject unto him, and worshiper of him.

To continue and abide with the Lord, in that wherein he has appeared, and
whereby he does accompany the souls of his people, both in the ministration and
government of Spirit, for refreshment and preservation to teach and defend them
against the power and policy of Satan; and for the benefit, and safety of the
people of God: so that the continuation and abiding with God, in the way and
worship of God, is not to be looked upon as a customary traditional or formal
thing: which the Lord does not own, for it is the duty of the people of God
under the Covenant of grace to continue in the things wherein they have been,
and are instructed of God, and are assured of, 2 Timothy 3.14. Ioh. 15.4.5.
knowing of whom they have learned them, as the Saints did: and according to
the Doctrine of Christ.

That wherein God appears and abides is full of life, power, and virtue, and
what does God appear and abide in without form, either in the inward or
outward creation, so that the form wherein God appears and abides with his
people, in the spirit of his Son is full of life, virtue and consolation, the
Apostle says to the Church of God, and Saints in Christ Jesus which were at
Philippie: let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus, who being
in the form of God thought it no Robery to be equal with God, Phillip 2.5, 6.
And if God should destroy and make void all form, wherein he appears, then
forasmuch as Christ Jesus is in the form of God, would not that be to destroy
Christ Jesus, but God does not destroy that form, therefore not all form and
comeliness as the enemy supposes: And if the Enemy of the soul, cannot beget
thee, to be negligent and careless in meeting, and continuing with the people
of God, under pretense of formality and customariness, would he not, by another
of his wiles and craftiness seek to deceive and seduce thee, and say, consider
what sweet refreshments and springings of Love thou have at home alone by thy
self, and what weights and burdens thou many times meets with at Meetings; and
is not thy souls Enemy under pretense of putting thee in mind of taking that
into consideration ready to say, thou had better stay at home, and not go to
Meetings, then to go thither to bear many burdens, or else say thou should
not have been at that Meeting, and go no more, unless thou have some special
motion to go unto Meetings; and under that pretense does he not mysteriously
labor to kill thee, so that thou begins to die to thy love, and faithfulness,
if thou lend an ear to him, and then thou will loose strength and grow weak,
and after that when thou should go to a meeting, he will tell thee, thou
either have no motion to go, or else it is not strong enough to raise thee
above and carry thee through the reasonings and over the oppositions which thou
meets withal in thee to hinder and keep thee from going to meetings, so that
the Enemy is mysteriously destroying of thee, and labors to slay thee in thy
Principles and Testimony; and when thou art dead, thou art ready to judge
others to be out of the Life, and Power of Truth, through thy mistake, and if
he cannot wholly prevail with any to absent from all Meetings, does he not go
about by another of his slights and cunning devices, and tell thee in secret,
that if thou go to meetings, thou should not go to public mixed Meetings, to
bear Burdens, but should meet with those only that are nearest unto thee, and
the equallest in condition and growth with thee, and so harkening unto him he
draws out into Parties, and begins to rent and divide thee from the Body, and
begets some others into the like subtilty, and self separation with thee, and
presents them to thee, and thee unto them, and labors to gather you after that
manner into the mystery of Iniquity, and makes Parties, and causes devisions,
and that is the way to Sects and Schisms.

Now when thou art once acquainted with the Lord, both in counsel, direction,
instruction, power, virtue, and consolation, in a spiritual ministration, and
have tasted of the good word of God, and of the powers of the world to come,
which are spiritual and eternal powers which binds under, keeps down, and turns
aside the earthly dark powers within thee, and makes way to come to that which
is oppressed, and afflicted within thee, to relieve it, refresh and minister
unto it, wherein and whereby it has many Testimonies, of the Love and
Acceptance of God in that ministration, as well as refreshments and souls
consolation; thou art therein to mind thy continuation and abiding with God and
his people in that ministration, that thou may appear for the Lord in the
Assemblies of his Saints, in that Principle and Spirit, wherein the Lord has
appeared unto thee, that in that Spirit and Power, wherein the Lord has born
with thee, thou may bear with others, that are under Burdens, Sufferings,
Exercises and Trials, and so by bearing one another burden, with the Spirit
and Power of God, the Law of Christ is fulfilled, and thereby thou and others
will be eased, refreshed, reached unto, by the power, and filled with the Love
and virtue of God, to be a sweet savor to the Lord, and one in another, that
he may be honored and glorified; and if thou be under a burden, at any time in
a Meeting, do thou fetch it in, or is it laid upon thee that thou may be as
a help to another, to simpathize with such as are burdened, and under a
Suffering condition; Gal. 6.2.
for it is said, Bear ye one another burden, and so fulfill the Law of Christ:
have thou been burdened, and has not the life and power of truth, joined with
that which was burdened and afflicted within thee, to help the oppressed until
the burden was removed, and the afflicted was relieved, and the oppressed in
spirit was eased, and art thou unwilling to bear with others, and be a help to
them when they are under burdens, troubles, trials, and exercises, whether art
thou then in the life and power of love, which is willing to help the
oppressed, and does bear and endure under all burdens, trials, and exercises,
until it rise over all that which oppresses, and minister to the afflicted
for its refreshment, does not many times the strong bear the infirmities or
burdens of the weak, Romans 15.1 2, 3, 4, 5. 1 Cor. 13.4.5, 6, 7.
nay is there not a desire arises many times in those that are most in the
life and power of love which is acquainted with bearing of burdens, and helping
the afflicted, when it sees others under afflictions and burdens, that they may
be a help to them in that estate, desiring that the burden of the oppressed,
may come so much upon them, as the other may be eased, knowing that the power
will ease them again, and does not the oppressed many times both in meetings
and when they are visited by a good Friend, feel the burden go so much from
them as that they are eased, and when it is so, does it not go upon some that
feels when it comes upon them and are they not so made meet helps in the Lord
one to another after a spiritual manner, for if I come freshly, and lively into
a meeting and have no burden upon me, if a burden do come when I am there I
feel the life bear it, and I know thereby that some or other is eased by it,
and I waighting patiently and with contentedness under the burden, the life and
power of truth works through it, and rises over it, so that I am eased and
refreshed, and in the power and virtue of the life and spirit of God, am made
to minister to the afflicted, and to be a simpathizer with the oppressed.

So that we may say (as the servants of God did in former ages) to the Church
of God, and Saints in Christ Jesus, blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord
Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort, who comforteh
us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any
trouble, by the comfort wherewith we our selves are comforted of God, for as
the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our Consolation also abounds by
Christ, and whether we be afflicted it is for your Consolation and salvation,
which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings, which we also
suffer, or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation,
and our hope of you is steadfast, knowing that as you are partakers of the
sufferings; so shall ye be also of the Consolation, as it is written and left
upon Record in Scripture, 2 Cor. 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. It is a precious, and an
excellent thing, to be in that power which measures spirits and lets forth it
self in power and virtue in a ministration to several estates and conditions,
and does acquaint one another with the way and manner of its working and
bearing of burdens, when the soul is in sufferings.

To Simpathize with it therein, as well as to h^ve fellowship with it in
consolation, or else how should we perform that Christian office and duty,
both in tribulation and consolation, which in the spirit of love we are to do,
for we are to suffer with them that suffer, as well as to rejoice, with them
that rejoice, therefore it is good to know one another under sufferings, that
we may have fellowship one with another, both in sufferings and in rejoycings;
and so be helps in the Lord one to another, to do good unto all, but not to
hurt or destroy any that are weak in the Faith, and attended with many
weaknesses, trials or exercises, so that we may always upon the account of the
Lord, and his service, both appear and be found in that principle and spirit
wherein we and our services may be acceptable, and well pleasing to the Lord,
and helpful one to another, through Christ Jesus the Son of his love.

For assuredly God has appeared and spoken unto us in spirit, and called us
out of the way and worship of the spirit of the world, and has made known that
which is certain unto us, that is to say; the tried known Truth, and true way
and worship of God in the spirit, and we are not to leave or forsake it, least
it be said who required thee to forsake the way and worship of God, the Lord
has made known the truth and way of his worship unto us, and he has called us
unto it, and required us to continue and Abide with him in it, and therefore it
is our duty to meet together as God has commanded and not to forsake the
assemblies of the people of God when man does forbid us, for we have judged
already that if God command us to meet and assemble together to wait upon God
and true worshipers of him, and if men do command the contrary, and forbid us
to meet under great penalties, in such cases we are to obey God rather then
man, and the Lord has given us this Testimony that he owns and accepts of us
in so doing.

For if God command one thing and man command another thing, It is better to
obey God then man in such cases, because the Lords power is absolute, add his
commands are righteous and just, and therefore ought to be obeyed, he has
power to pardon or punish as we are obedient or disobedient unto him, and he
has right to teach, order and dispose of us both by Creation and by
Redemption, who has punishments for the wicked, and rewards for the righteous:
and if he be offended or displeased by denying obedience to his just and
righteous commands, whose power is the highest power, to obey the will and
commands of men who are contrary minded to him, to avoid a suffering condition,
no King nor Potentate upon earth can deliver from the wrath and displeasure of
God for so doing; but if we fall into the wrath and displeasure of men, for
denying their commands which are contrary to the commands and requirings of
God, to be obedient and subject unto him, whose power is absolute, and who has
right both by creation and redemption, to claim our obedience and subjection
unto him, he can deliver us from the wrath and displeasure of man; and
therefore it is the Saints duty to be obedient to God, and it is for their
safety and happiness to continue in his word and doctrine, and in all
conditions to abide true and faithful unto him, though we be attended with
sufferings from men for so doing.

An Epistle to go amongst friends to be read in the fear and wisdom of God.
DEar Friends, Brethren, and Sisters, whom I dearly love in the Lord, my dear
love runs forth unto you, has an entrance within you, and does rest upon you.
It is a precious thing to feel the Lord possessing our hearts and spirits,
living, ruling, and reigning within us, and to feel one another in the power of
an endless life, which is for our refreshment, and great consolation, they who
are under the daily administration of the spirit and power of God, do daily
partake of the love, virtue and sweetness of God; for the power binds under
or removes all obstructions, oppositions, and interpositions, and besetments of
soul, and reaches unto it for its relief and refreshment, and carries forth
unto it of the eternal sweetness, that it feeds at the breast, and is
nourished with the milk of the Word, which is the virtue of God, and tastes of
its sweetness: so that it can say as David did, Thy word is sweeter unto my
taste then the honey, and the honeycomb. The Lord has come forth in power
unto us, and we are witnesses thereof: so has he come forth in virtue and
sweetness within us, and our souls have tasted thereof, he has been with us
in stroms and tempests, so that the floods of afflictions and waters of
persecutions has not destroyed us, we have been kept in the Ark of the
Covenant above the waters, and carried over to the dry land of peace and rest
by the arm of the Lord, he has stood between us and the dangers, and has kept
back the force of the storms, and violence of the enemy from us, so that though
he has often tried us, yet he did not thereby destroy us, but had a way in his
wisdom to keep and preserve us, and though troubles and afflictions attend us,
yet the Lords refreshing presence is with us, and his free spirit does uphold
us. We have this testimony that we are a people blessed and beloved of God; and
though our troubles have heretofore been many, yet our deliverances have been
as many, for many are the troubles of the righteous, but the Lord delivers
out of them all. And as we have had many deliverances wrought and brought to
pass for us by the arm and power of the Lord, so we have had many testimonies
of his love and refreshings from his presence brought home upon our hearts, and
reached into our spirits; and therefore we have had many encouragements from
him to continue and abide with the Lord when ever we are afflicted and tried.

The Lord has given his Word unto us, and we have the promise of the Lord,
that he will never fail us nor forsake us. And therefore have we cause to
believe in his Word; for though we are brought forth into a trying time, yet it
is the Lords own doing, and he who has begotten us to himself through the Son
of his love into a Covenant of Grace, and brought us forth to appear for him in
that principle and spirit of Jesus, wherein we and our services are acceptable
and well pleasing to the Lord, though opposed and hated by the principle and
spirit of the world, he knows how to keep and preserve us to his own praise.

For the Lord has appeared unto us, and joined himself with us in a spiritual
way, and after a spiritual manner; and he has signified by his good spirit
that we are his people, and he is our God, and we have this testimony that we
and our services are acceptable and well pleasing unto him: and therefore we
have good cause to continue and abide with the Lord.

Dear friends, be at peace amongst your selves, and let the peace of God rule
in your hearts, give way to nothing that would obstruct or hinder it, and let
the word of Christ dwell plentifully in you. Be diligent and faithful to the
Lord, for he has been and is faithful unto you, you have no just cause of
complaint against him; therefore let him have no just cause of complaint
against you. And for as much as he has chosen you, and manifested his love
unto you, and joined himself with you, deal not unworthily with him, so as to
forsake him: break no Covenant with him, neither do you separate your selves
from him again, but be true and faithful unto the Lord, and continue with him,
notwithstanding all tribulations and afflictions that does or may attend you in
a trying time, and under a suffering condition.

Be tender and loving one to another, as the Lord has been and is tender and
loving to you, do not uncover one another nakedness to the world, nor to such
as do or may seek an occasion against them and the truth, for the Lord has not
dealt so with you; therefore do unto others as the Lord has done unto you, and
always appear for the Lord in the principle and spirit of God that you may
reach unto, and be answered again by the witness of God.

Take heed of judging any appearance of God in one another, but cherish every
good thing, and judge this rather, that you lay not a stumbling block in
another way to offend the weak, or cause them to fall, and turn aside from the
truth and way of the Lord.

And be diligent and faithful in meeting together in the way of the Lord, as
worshippers of him, and do not forsake the assembling of your selves together
for fear of an outward suffering from men; for it is your duty to assemble and
meet together in the fear of the Lord, and it is a danger to be negligent in
that respect, if men command you to neglect the assembling of your selves
together in the way of the Lord, as worshippers of him, in such a case it is
better to obey God rather then man; for if you for your obedience and
faithfulness to God in assembling and meeting together in the way of his
worship (wherein he has enjoined you to walk) do fall into the hands of men,
and be liable to suffer by them for so doing, the Lord knows both how to
support you under the sufferings, and can also deliver you from them, but if
you do forsake the way of the Lord wherein he has appeared unto you, and
wherein he has for many years owned you, and given you many testimonies of his
love and acceptance, and fall into the hand and displeasure of God for so
doing, no King nor Potentate upon earth can deliver you therefrom. Therefore it
is better and more safe to obey the Lord, and fall into the hands and
displeasure of men for the same, then to disobey the Lord, to obey the will of
man and fall under the displeasure of God for so doing, because that no man can
deliver you from the wrath of the Lord, but the Lord can deliver from the wrath
and displeasure of man, and cause one to rejoice and be glad under a suffering
condition, for tribulation works patience, and patience experience, and
experience hope which makes not ashamed.

You know what the Lord has been unto you in former trialls, and how he has
taken all slavish fears and faintness of heart from you, and has letten forth
his power and virtue within you, and put boldness and courage upon you, so
that you have been possessed with the power of heaven, and made to rejoice and
triumph under a suffering condition, when you have suffered for the Lord and
his truth; so that he has both armed and prepared you for himself, that you
may give up into his will to be ordered and disposed of by him, for ye are not
your own, but are bought with a price. Therefore glorify God in your bodies,
souls, and spirits, which are the Lords, that you may be the people of his
praise.

The Lord has a right to dispose of you both by creation and by redemption,
and has delivered your souls from under the power of the enemy, who sought
your destruction, and has prevented him, and preserved you unto this day, and
also been with you in many dangers, and stood betwixt you and the danger, and
delivered you therefrom, and kep^ you to appear at this time for him, and it
would be great unkindnesse and unworthiness in you now to deny the Lord, and
give him occasion against you. Oh therefore be strong in the Lord, in the
faith, in the love and power of his might, and be bold and valiant for you who
is worthy. God blessed for ever.
