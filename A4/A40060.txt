AN HUMBLE REMONSTRANCE FROM His Excel. Sir Thomas Fairfax and The Army under
His Command: concerning the present estate of Affairs in relation to
themselves and the Kingdom, with their Desires and present Resolutions
thereupon.
1. OUR Desires as Soldiers in behalf of our selves and other Soldiers that
have faithfully served the Parliament in this Kingdom, as also our remaining
dissatisfactions in relation thereunto, may be clearly collected out of our
several Papers that have formerly been presented to the Parliament concerning
the same, to which particulars we have not yet received any further
satisfaction.

2. In our last Representation it may appear what our Desires are, as Members
of the Common wealth in behalf of our selves and all others for the clearing,
settling, and securing of the Rights, Liberties and Peace of the Kingdom: for
the Justness, Reasonableness, Necessity, and Common-concernment whereof unto
all, we dare appeal to the whole Kingdom, and to the World: yet we have
hitherto received no answer thereunto, nor can we hear of any consideration
taken thereupon, to put the things contained therein into any way of resolution
or dispatch.

3. We have since, in pursuance of the first and second head of our desires in
the said representation, delivered in a charge against diverse persons, Members
of the House of Commons, for diverse designs and practices to the abuse and
Dishonor of the Parliament the unsufferable injury of the Army, the infringment
of the Rights and Liberties both of Soldiers and Subjects, the breach or
hazard of the Peace of this Kingdom, and the hinderance of the relief of
Ireland etc.

4. Upon which though the maine things charged, with the mischievous effects
and further dangerous consequences of them, as also the constant and continued
activity of all, or most of the persons charged in relation to those things,
for the most part are sufficiently known, especially to the Parliament it
self, yet we find neither any thing done upon what is so known, nor any way
resolved on or admitted by the Parliament for the examination or discovery of
what may be less known: But rather (as if neither the things charged nor the
present sad effects nor future ill consequences thereof were at all
considerable) the whole business seems to be slightly past over or set aside.

Lastly we did with these deliver in another paper (whereof here is a Copy
annexed) containing diverse just and necessary things which we did desire might
be provided for, and done for the better proceeding in the Premises with more
safety to our selves and the Kingdom, and with more assurance or hopes of a
timely and happy issue.

To which things desired (which we suppose all men reasonable will think just
and necessary) we have yet received no answer or resolution, nor can find any
consideration at all had of them, save that a months pay is sent down to the
Army, whilst those that have deserted the Army, receive at London much more,
and that some Votes have bin passed for the annulling the Committee pretended
for safety about listing of men and drawing of Forces together, which Votes we
find rendered but vain and delusive, by the continued underhand practices of
those whom we have charged and their accomplices in listing and engaging men
for a new War, and by a later days Votes not admitting that the Forces so
listed or engaged should by public Order be dismissed or discharged: which with
other things we cannot but attribute chiefly to the prevalent influance of
the same persons.

Now whereas we find that our first desire in the Paper last mentioned (for
present suspending the persons Impeached from sitting in the House) is judged
by some to be against the course and Privilege of Parliament, or of ill
consequence in the president of it, (the charge being but general and no
particular proofs as yet produced to render the proceedings Legal) we cannot
but remind the Parliament.

First, That as the most and maine things charged (with the sad effects and
consequences of them) so the constant and continued activity, of all or most of
the persons charged in relation thereunto, (in misinforming, deluding, abusing
or surprising the House, and otherwise, are sufficiently known to the
Parliament it self,) so as the House might upon their own past and present
cognizance of the same, most justly proceed to suspend them,) as (in many other
cases upon far less occasions which never could have produced such sad
effects to the Kingdom,) they have done many other of their members merely
for words spoken of things moved in the House alleged to be but against Order
or Custom of the House, and this without any trial, proof or charge, but
merely upon the Houses own cognizance of the things, as we could instance in
many cases since this Parliament began.

Secondly, Whereas many of the things to which the Charge relates, are things
spoken, moved or done in the House, so as yet we have no clear way opened
particularly to charge or mention them, or to produce proofs to them, without
some pretense against us of breach of privilege, and therefore (though we
think no privilege ought to protect evil men in doing wrong to particulars,
or mischief to the Public yet,) we have been hitherto so tender of
Parliament-Priviledges, as that we have only remonstrated the evil of such
things done, and supposing the House to have been (as we did, and do believe,
and if way were open, without breach of Privilege, should not doubt to prove
it was) some ways misinformed, deluded, surprised, or otherwise abused in
these things by evil members, we have frequently in former papers, (before the
Charge) put the Parliament upon it, (who without color of breach of Privilege
might do it,) to find out and discover who they were that had so abused them,
and to disingage the Honor of Parliament from the evil practices and designs
of such Incendiaries.

Now since the same difficulties or prejudices lie yet in our way, (as to the
particular charging or proof of such things against members.) And the
Parliament (though so often put upon it in our former papers, yet through the
powerful interest of the persons guilty,) has not taken any cognizance what
members or others have so abused them, to draw the Parliament to such dishonor
and inconveniences, we cannot but again more fully and clearly assert (as we
have in former papers, and shall more particularly if need be, remonstrate)
that diverse things lately done and passed from the Parliament against this
Army, (as particularly the Order for suppressing the Petition, that high
Declaration against it, and against all that should proceed in it, putting the
faithful servants of the Parliament and Kingdom out of the protection of the
Law, and exposing them as enemies to the State, etc: to the forfeiture of
Estates, Liberties, Life and all, but for going about in an humble, peaceable
and inoffensive way, to desire what was undeniably, their due and dearly
earned, and many other such like proceedings both against the Army, and
others,) do carry with them such a face of injustice, oppression,
arbitrarinesse and tyranny, as (we think) is not to be paraleld in any former
proceedings of the most Arbitrary Courts against any private men, but have
brought insufferable dishonor upon the Parliament, (which we are, and others
ought to be deeply sensible of,) has tended to disobliedge all men,
especially Soldiers from the same, to destroy all just freedom either of
Soldiers or Subjects, and has conduced to all other the sad effects and worse
consequences, expressed in the Charge, and gives us and others cause to
conclude that those Worthies, who have formerly acted and carried on things in
Parliament for Publique-Good, Right and Freedom, are now awed or over-borne by
a prevailing party of men of other private interests crept in, and that neither
we, nor any other can reasonably expect right freedom or safety (as private
men or) to have things acted in Parliament for public good while the same
persons continue there in the same power to abuse the name and authority of
Parliament, to serve and prosecute their private interests and passions and
(under the privileges of Parliament) to shelter themselves under the worst of
evils or mischeifes they can do, though to the Ruin of the Kingdom. We are
in this case forced (to our great grief of heart) thus plainly to assert the
present evil and mischief, together with the future worse consequences of the
things lately done even in the Parliament it self, (which are too evident and
visible to all.) And so (in their proper colors) to lay the same at the
Parliaments doors, until the Parliament shall be pleased either of themselves
to take notice and rid the Houses of those who have any way misinformed,
deluded, surprised, or otherwise abused the Parliament to the passing such
foul things there, or shall open to us and others some way how we may
(regularly and without the scandal of breaking Privileges come to charge and
prosecute those particular persons, that (in truth) have so abused the
Parliament, (as well as our selves) even for those misinformations, and other
evil and indirect practices or proceedings in Parliament, whereby they have so
abused the same (as in our said Charge and former papers is set forth.)

And here (if we may) we should humbly offer to consideration whether it were
not a necassary expedient, for prevention or remedy of such evils in future,
that in things so clearly distructive to the common Rights and Liberties of
the people, and the safety of the Kingdom, there should be a liberty for
dissenting members in the house of Commons (as it is allowed in the house of
Peers) to enter their dissent, and thereby to acquit themselves from the guilt
or blame of what evil may ensue, that so the Kingdom may regularly come to
know who they are that perform their trust faithfully, and who not. And this
provision for the future, (as also our desires for remedy in the present cases)
as it were clearly good and necessary in the respects premised, so (we
think) the same may well be without future prejudice or discouragement in any
other respects to succeeding Members of Parliament. Providing always that no
man shall be questioned or censured for any thing said or done in Parliament
any further then to exclusion from that trust, which is all that in the present
case we should desire upon any such grounds. And that future liberty of
entering dissents we do not here propose as a thing we any way insist on to
the prejudice of Parliament privileges, we only offer it to consideration,
and that from good wishes to the Privileges of Parliament, to render them more
lasting by being less nocent. And indeed whoever most adores or tenders those
Privileges, will best express his zeal toward them in taking care they be
not abused or extended to private wrong or public mischief. (For we clearly
find and all wise men may see it) that Parliament Privileges, as well as
Royall-Prerogative, may be perverted and abused to the destruction of those
greater ends for whose protection and preservation they were admitted or
intended (viz. the Rights and Liberties of the people and safety of the whole)
and in case they be so, the abuse, evil, or danger of them is no iesse to be
contended against, and a remedy thereof no less to be endeavored, then of the
other.

And whereas the injustice (in that particular of the Declaration against the
Army for their just and innocent Petition) may seem to have bin recompensed in
the late expungeing thereof out of the Journall books. We confess it had bin
so in great measure, as to the particular or present injury done to the Army
therein, and (we cannot but acknowledge therefore the Justice that lies in
those Votes for expungeing thereof, and for our own or the Armies particular
reparation, we should neither wish more, nor scarce have insisted on so much
to any dishonor of Parliaments in future, and we should rather have been
satisfied with the Parliaments declaring how, and by whom they have bin
misinformed, surprised, or otherwise abused in the framing, proposal or
passing thereof as it was, but as to that particular, or any other of that
nature, we say as follows.

1. We never did nor do value or regard our own injury or reparation in any
comparison to the consequence of the one, to the prejudice of the other, or to
the future security of common right and freedom in this Nation. And
accordingly we do not account any reparation considerable that extends but to
our selves in the present case, and does not in some sort secure our selves,
and all others from danger of the same or worse injuries or oppressions, (as
private men from the wills and passions of the same persons that have offered
and acted such things against us while an Army.

2. We cannot but imagine and consider (according to general report) how the
expungeing of that Declaration was carried and obtained and upon what grounds
and intentions it was given way to, but had those that procured it been all for
expungeing it (and that freely) yet how can we expect better but that the same
men who at one time carried such a Declaration, and another time expunged it,
may the next day obtain the like or worse (upon any occasion wherein it may
serve their private ends or interests) if they continue in the same power and
sway and be let pass in deluding and surprising the Parliament as they have
done in the past particulars.

3. The apparent dishonor and prejudice brought upon the Parliament, in having
such a Declaration so passed as they should soon after (without any
alteration) in the pretended ground of it find cause (for shame of the world)
to expunge, (we think) should engage those Members that love Parliaments, in
point of honor, to find out and discover, how, and by whom the Parliament had
been abused or therwise brought into such an inconveniency. And the Parliament
may in this see the temper (as bystanders do the prevalence) of those Members
that abused the Parliament in that Declaration, who will and can make the
Authority of Parliament still lie under the dishonor of it (in a bare
expungeing or retracting) rather then to admit any consideration to acquit the
authority of Parliament that would tend to fix the blame on those particular
Members that had deserted it. And this certainly will be admitted and done
rather then to slight it over in a bare expungeing, were not some men more
tender of, and more swayed with such considerations and consequences as may
tend to the prejudice of persons, then such as tend to the general prejudice
and dishonor of Parliaments.

As to these particulars included in our charge which depend on things don
without the Parliament we are ready and should most willingly proceed in the
particular charging, and proving thereof if (first from the Justice of the
House in a present proceeding against the persons charged for those things that
are already known to the house being done in it) we could find encouragement
to expect any good issue upon those other things, and did we not (on the
contrary) find that (notwithstanding what is so known to the House as before
expressed) the same persons continue in such power and prevalence both in the
House and in all Committees of the highest trust as leaves little hope of right
or satisfaction to the Army or Kingdom in other things and much less in any
just proceeding against themselves while they continue Judges of their own and
our concernments, so as we cannot, while they remain in the same power, expect
any other but a continued perverting and making advantage of all things (and
especially of those delays which a regular proceeding against them would
necessarily induce) altogether to our own and the Kingdoms prejudice and
danger disable or weaken us for those things which the safety and settling of
the Rights, Liberties, and Peace of the Kingdom requires: And to strengthen
themselves by underhand practices and preparations both at home and abroad the
better to oppose us and engage the Kingdom in a new War, thereby to accomplish
their designs, or at least to save themselves from Justice in a common
confusion: We say were it not for these and such other considerations, that
leave little hopes of Justice to our selves or the Kingdom (while they
continue in the same power) and render all delays dangerous and distructive to
our selves and peace of the Kingdom, we should be contented that the business
concerning the Members we have charged should be laid aside till those other
things were first settled, which our Declaration does propound for the common
rights and liberties of the Kingdom.

But finding things still so carried as they are and as we have before expressed
and (...) while they are Judges in their own causes they (with that party which
they make) will do what they please, and yet render it (...) brea^h of
privilidge to be a cused for it, we cannot but upon all these consi^^rations
and for all the reasons before expressed insist upon it that the numbers charged
may first be forth with suspended from sitting in the House otherwise we cannot
expect any fair proceedings (...) them upon (...) more particular charge nor
think there is any good (...) to ourselves or the Kingdom,

As (...) having the Army presently paid up equally with those that have (...)
(...) we appeal to all men for the Justice, reasonableness, and necessity
thereof.

The Justice in that the former service (for which these arrears are due) has
been (at least) as faithfully and diligently performed by the Army as by those
late deserters of it and in our present posture (though they have appeared
indeed more officious and serviceable to the interest and will of particular
men then we, yet we are sure) the Army is and (we hope) will at last appear to
be more faithful to the true interest of Parliament, and the Kingdom (which
we were at first called out and engaged for) then they in deserting the Army
have hitherto appeared.

For the reasonableness of our desires though we have ground to claim more then
they, or rather that they or some of them should forfeit their Arrears, yet we
ask (for present) but equal nor should we (at present) insist much on that
(as to Officers) if our Souldies were but first paid up. Our necessity to
insist on that, is obvious to every man, and therefore (unless we should betray
our own and the Kingdoms cause) we cannot but possitively insist upon it,
that the Army should forth with be paid up (at the least) equally to those
desertors of it which if denied or delayed, we shall be thereby inforct upon
present ways of iustant remedy and right-to the Army therein.

And whereas the Parliament has lately ordered and publicly declared that all
that shall desert the Army shall have present satisfaction in their Arreares
(the Officers three months pay, the Soldiers all their Arreares deducting for
free quarter) which still continues unrecalled, we cannot but look upon it as a
most clear evidence of the continuing malice and prevalence of ours and the
Kingdoms Enemies. And we must and do insist upon it, that that order or
Declaration may forthwith be publikly recalled, otherwise we cannot believe
that any thing but ruin and destruction is designed to our selves and all
others in the Kingdom, who every where call upon us, not to disband till we
see the Rights, Liberties, and peace of the Kingdom settled according to the
many Declarations by which we were first called forth, and invited to engage in
the late War.

Next we cannot but take notice that (instead of granting or Answering our
desires in the last paper) in order to the better and more safe proceeding to a
composure and settlement of all things for the good and peace of the Kingdom,
and for prevention of a new War the Army being first commanded to forty miles
distance from London, his Majesty's Person is demanded immediately to Richmond
house within eight miles of London which (as we cannot but impute it) to the
prevailing interest of the same enemies to our, and the Kingdoms peace, so all
men may easily discern (with us) how directly it tends (in pursuance of their
former private design) upon the King ere he came from Holdenby to put his
Majesty within the reach of those men's power who have under hand Listed about
London already very considerable numbers both of horse and foor, and are daily
listing and engaging more both there and in many parts of the Kingdom to serve
their designs: And therefore we appeal to all uningaged men whether we can in
this give way to have the King put so far within those men's power without
giving them the so long sought for advantage of his Majesty's Person, whereby
to embroyle the Kingdom in a new and bloody War, and to strengthen themselves
in their mischievous designs, the better to uphold and establish their faction
and intended domination, so that in this case we cannot but importune the
Parliament (as they tender the peace and safety of the Kingdom and the
avoiding of Jealousies or worse inconveniency in the Army) that they would
resume the consideration of that business concerning the Person of the King,
and not propose any place for him nearer to London then they would have the
Quarters of the Army to be.

And whereas (by the procurement of the same persons, or others of their party)
there has been scandalous informations presented to the Houses, and
industriously published in Print, importing, as if his Majesty were kept as a
prisoner amongst us, and barbarously and uncivilly used, we cannot but declare
that the same and all other suggestions of that sort, are most false and
scandalous, and absolutely contrary, not only to our declared desires, but
also to our principles, which are most clearly for a general right and just
freedom to all men. And therefore upon this occasion we cannot but declare
particularly, that we desire the same for the King, and others of his party (so
far as can consist with common right or freedom) and with the security of
the same for future) and we do further clearly profess, we do not see how
there can be any peace to this Kingdom, firm or lasting without a due
consideration of, and provision for the Rights, Quiet, and Immunity of his
Majesty's Royal Family, and his late partakers, and herein we think that
tender and equitable dealing (as supposing their cases had been ours) and a
spirit of common love and justice, diffusing it self, to the good and
preservation of all, will make up the most glorious conquests over their
hearts, (if God in mercy see it good) to make them, and the whole people of the
Land, lasting friends.

Now to draw to a conclusion: since we can yet obtain no satisfaction or
answer to the things desired as before, but contrariwise find all things
carried on by the prevailing interest of those our enemies, to the prejudice
and danger of our selves and the Kingdom, since (notwithstanding some Votes of
Parliament, against the late Orders of the Committee of Safety, for listing of
Forces, and notwithstanding the earnest desires and indevours of the City,
concurrent with our own, to have the same prevented or remedyed, yet the said
Committee of Safety being continued still in the same power) we find that by
the appointment or contrivance, and under the protection or countenance of the
same persons whom we have charged, and their accomplices, there are still
manifold practices underhand, to list and raise new Forces, and
(notwithstanding the discovery thereof to the Parliament from the City, yet)
the same persons have prevailed so far in the House, as not to admit the
Question for dischargeing of them, but the same practices still continue, and
with double diligence are enforced since: also diverse forces (pretended to have
engaged for Ireland) are by the same persons ordered to Randezvouz about
Worcester, there to lay the foundation of a new Army. And to that purpose their
Emissaries and correspondents in all Counties, are busy and active to raise
forces for them. And though for these things the actors of them have no present
public authority, yet they have some way such countenance or assistance to be
justified in Parliament, (if questioned for it) as that they have the
confidence to act openly, since they have likewise their Emissaries or agents
abroad in Scotland, France, and other Countries, very active to draw in Foraine
Forces for their assistance: since in the mean time, they are indevouring by
Spies, and secret agents in all our Quarters, to inveigle and invite the
Soldiers of this Army to desert their Officers and come to London, And for
that purpose do improve the advantage of the Order or Declaration of
Parliament aforementioned, for satisfaction of Arreares to such as shall
desert the Army. And we find they have the public purse so much at their
disposal, as to make good that, and other their undertakings of that nature,
and yet such as have so deserted the Army and received their Arrears, are not
discharged or dispersed, but continued together in bodies, and under Command,
in or near the City, (as in particular some of Sir Robert Py^s men, Coll.
Greaves his Cap. Farmers and others still Quartered upon Kent) Since likewise
they have their Agents, and Correspondents, laboring with the King to make
contracts with him to draw his Majesty to engage, and declare for them, or at
least to declare himself a prisoner amongst us, whereby to stir up and engage
his party against us, since in all these respects we find all delatory ways
(which they industriously devise) to be designed and made use of only to our
disadvantage, weakening, and ruin, and the Kingdoms prejudice, and to their
own advantage, and strengthening in their designs, the better to prepare for a
new war.

And lastly, considering the multitudes of Reformadoes and other Soldiers,
swarming about the City (whom the persons we have charged and their
accomplices, have at their beck, to bring up to Westminster when they please)
and that by their frequent tumultuous confluences thither (besetting, and
sometimes blocking up the Parliament doors threatening and offering violence to
the persons of the most faithful Parliament men) the just freedom of
Parliament seems to be taken away or at least for the present abrogated in so
much that those Members who have served the Kingdom hitherto with most
faithfulness, diligence and integrity for the public good, many of them dare
scarce come to the House; or (if they do) they come in fear and peril of
their lives, and when they are there, are awed, discharged, or disabled from
discharging their consciences, or doing their duties to the Kingdom.

Upon all these considerations, we are clearly convinced and satisfied, that
both our duties and trust for the Parliament and Kingdom, calls upon us, and
warrants us, and an imminent necessity (for our own and the Kingdoms safety,
and prevention of a new war) enforces us to make or admit of no longer
delays, but upon these foundations God has given us with vigor and speed, to
endeavor in some extraordinary way, the vindicating of Parliament freedom from
tumultuons violence, the breaking of these designs and preparations that
otherwise threaten a present imbroilement of the Kingdom in more blood and war
and a future perpetuable inslaving of it under faction and Tyranny. And so (if
God see it good) to put the Parliament into a freedom and capacity (with his
Majesty's wished and hoped concurrence) to settle the rightes, liberties, and
peace of the Kingdom.

Upon all these grounds, and for all these ends premised, we shall be enforced
to take such courses extraordinary, as God shall enable and direct us unto, to
put things to a speedy issue, unless by Thursday night next we receive
assurance and security to our selves and the Kingdom, for a more safe and
hopeful proceeding in an ordinary way, by having those things granted, which
in order thereunto we have before insisted on. And shall here for more brevity
and clearness, repeat as follows.

1 That the declaration, inviting men to desert the Army, and promising their
Arrears in case they do so, may be recalled and anulled.

2 That the Army may be presently paid up equally to those that have deserted
it.

3 That his Majestys coming to Richmond may be suspended until affairs be
(...) settled and composed. And in the mean time noe place may be appointed
that may be any nearer to London than the Parliament will allow the Quarters of
the Army to be.

4 That the Members charged may be forthwith suspended or sequestered the House.

5 That those that have deserted the Army, may be instantly discharged and
dispersed and receive no more of their Arrears till the Army be first satisfied.

6 That both Parliament and City may be speedily and effectually freed from
those multitudes of Reformados and Soldiers before mentioned that flock
together about London by a speedy dispatch and discharging of them from the
City.

7 That all such listings or raising of new forces or drawing together of any
before mentioned and all preparations toward a new war may be effectually
declared against and suppressed as also all invitations or endeavors to draw
in foreign forces.

8 That the present perplexed affairs of the Kingdom and those concerning the
Army is also all the things desired in our late representation in behalf of
the Kingdom may be put into some speedy way of settlement, and composure.


St. Albans, June 23. 1647. By the appointment of his Excellency Sir Thomas
Fairfax, and the Council of War. John Rushworth, Secretary.
