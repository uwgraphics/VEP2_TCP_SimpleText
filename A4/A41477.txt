A BREVIATE Of the SUFFERING CASE of WILLIAM GOODERIDGE. Somerset

JAmes Crosman, Vicar of Banwel, sues William Gooderidge Quaker, by Bill in the
Exchequer; and for his not answering upon Oath, gets him imprisoned Thirteen
Years: And then by a Second Bill in the Court, obtains himself to be admitted
to swear his Tithes worth Six Pounds Ten Shillings per Annum, in all Seventy
eight Pounds; when indeed worth but about Forty Shillings per Annum; And still
taking Advantage upon his not Swearing, procures a Sequestration against the
said Gooderidge, and are in possession of about one hundred and fifty Pounds
Personal Estate, and his Real Estate of Sixty Pounds per Annum, for the Tithe
of Seventy eight Pounds; when in strictness was demandable only Twenty six
Pounds, and his Cost of Twenty Pounds; And continues the said Gooderidge in
Prison, and has turned his Wife, a lame Woman out of Doors, and left both in a
Ruinous and Suffering Condition; as by his Petition more at large will appear.
