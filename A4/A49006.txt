THis Day a Report was brought into this Court by the Committee appointed to
inspect the Acts and Proceedings entered in the Journals of this Court in the
Times of Usurpation, or at any time before or since, that might be fit to be
Explained or Repealed: The Tenor of which Report is as follows, that is to
say,

To the Right Honorable the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Commons of the City of
London, in Common Council Assembled.
WHereas by a late Order of this Honorable Court it was referred unto us,
whose Names are subscribed, to inspect the Acts and other Proceedings entered in
the Journals of this Court in the Times of Usurpation, or at any time before or
since, that may be thought fit to be Explained or Repealed; Now we do humbly
certify, That in pursuance of the said Order, We have perused and examined the
Journals of this Court in the Times of the late Rebellion, wherein we find not
only many Innovations and Irregularities brought into this Court and the
Government of this City; but also most pernicious and abominable Proceedings,
in abetting and carrying on those Wicked and Unnatural Divisions then raised in
the Kingdom, and serving the Usurpation of those Times. All, or most of which,
We persuade our selves, could never have had place in this Court, had not
Violence been offered to the Government of this City, the Lord Mayor been
Arrested and Imprisoned, diverse Loyal Aldermen and Commoners, some Imprisoned,
others Displaced, and all Loyal Citizens generally discountenanced and
discouraged, and Others of factious, unquiet and turbulent Spirits, got
themselves into the Common Council, and made up the greater Number therein. All
which Acts and Proceedings might (as they well deserve) be obliterated and
wholly expunged, that no Remembrance thereof should be transmitted to Posterity
to the shame and dishonor of this Court and City; but that other Matters are
therewith intermixed, which for the substance of them are, in our Opinions,
inoffensive, useful, and fit to be continued. Several Committees have formerly
been appointed by this Court to obliterate the said unjust Proceedings, and
there are Lines crossed over diverse of them, which (we presume) were made by
the said Committees; but not being thereby obliterated, and still remaining in
the Books as the Acts and Proceedings of this Court, and never having been
particularly Disclaimed and Repealed by any Vote or Act of this Court, (that we
have observed;) We think it very fitting, that the same, and all other like
disloyal and irregular Proceedings, should by an express Act of this Court be
Renounced, Repealed, and made absolutely Null and Void. Which Proceedings, or
most of them, We have here set down and present to this Honorable Court, for
that purpose; and desire that some few of them may be here openly read, to
beget in this Court (as it has done in Us) a just Abhorrence and Detestation
of such Proceedings; of which kind are the Proceedings following, Entered in the
Journals of this Court, viz.

All which Particulars aforesaid being highly disloyal, or savouring of the
Faction and Usurpation of those unhappy Times, are fit by Act of this Court to
be disclaimed, revoked, abrogated and repealed to all intents and purposes
whatsoever; which as it will demonstrate the Loyalty and good Affections of the
present Members of this Court to his Majesty and the established Government,
and vindicate them from all imputation of the like pernicious and destructive
Principles and Practices, and will also express their dislike of all factious
Innovation in the Usages and Constitutions of this City; so will it prevent any
ill use that may be made in time to come of the said irregular Actions.

And we having also seen several Entries in the Journals of this Court, that
the Lord Mayor and Aldermen upon matters here propounded, have taken time to
advise and consider thereof, and to others have declared their dissent, and
even in those worst of Times; as for Instance, The 14 March 1641. upon two
Petitions brought into Common Council by a Committee to be presented to the
Parliament, they were read, but not voted; because the Mayor's Locum tenens,
and the Major part of the Aldermen thought fit to advise of the same. And 24
Jan. 1644. it was declared by the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, That they had a
Negative Voice in Common Council by the ancient Custom and Charters of this
City. And we having also seen the Opinions of diverse Learned Councils,
heretofore given to the Court of Aldermen under their hands, viz. the present
L. Chief Justice Pemberton, Sir W. Dolbin, Sergeant Maynard, Sir W. Jones, Sir
G. Jeffries, and Sir Fr. Winnington, that the Lord Mayor and Aldermen have a
Negative Voice in making Laws and Orders, and admitting of Officers in Common
Council; we humbly propound (to take away all disputes in this matter for the
time to come) that the same may have the approbation and concurrence of this
Honorable Court.

And because We find the usage for the Lord Mayor to nominate or elect one of
the Sheriffs of this City and County of Middlesex was called in question, in
those troublesome and disorderly Times (as it has unhappily been this Year or
two last past) We have examined the usage in that particular; and find it very
ancient, and not questioned (that we can find) until the breaking out of those
Troubles. We have also seen very many Acts of Common Council that take notice
of and allow it, and particularly the Act made 7 Car. 1 touching the Election
of Sheriffs; to which last mentioned Act we are of Opinion, that an addition or
explanation should be made in some particulars, which seem not sufficiently
provided for thereby. And we have prepared a Bill for that purpose which we
here present to this Honorable Court. And therein also the said Usage for the
Lord Mayors Nomination or Election of one of the Sheriffs is further declared,
and provision made to remove all Disputes that might hereafter be made touching
the same; by which the peace and quiet of this City has been of late so
greatly disturbed.

All which Matters are humbly submitted to the wisdom and good pleasure of this
Honorable Court. This Fifth day of June, 1683. William Turner, James Edwards,
John Moore, Henry Tulce, Thomas Langham, Francis Griffith, Nathaniel Hawes,
Henry Loades, Peter Aylworth, Nicholas Charlton, Thomas Vernon,


After reading of which Report here openly in this Court, the same was by this
Court (in the several particulars thereof) well approved of, and agreed to and
confirmed: And it is Enacted by the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Commons in this
Common Council Assembled, That all the several Acts, Orders and Proceedings
therein propounded to be Disclaimed and Repealed, be repealed and made void;
And they and every of them are by Authority of this Court disclaimed, repealed,
and made null and void.

And the Bill in the said Report mentioned being now likewise read, it was put
to the question, whether the same should be read again or recommitted? and it
being thereupon determined to be read again, it was so done accordingly; And a
Question being then put, whether the same should be read a third time? it was
carried against the further reading thereof. Then upon a further Question,
whether the said Bill should pass, or no? and Poll (...) thereupon, 113
Commoners being for the passing it, and 78 against it, the same was passed and
made the Act of this Court, the Tenor of which Bill is as follows: That is to
say,

WHereas by an Act of Common Council made in the Seventh Year of King Charles
the First of Blessed memory ( Ducy Mayor) It is (amongst other things) Enacted,
That if any person being a Freeman of this City shall be chosen or elected
Sheriff of the same City and County of Middlesex, and publication thereof by
open Proclamation being made in the Guild Hall, in the place where the Court of
Hustings is usually holden in the presence of the Lord Mayor and Sir Aldermen
for the time being at the least, or in the absence of the Lord Mayor, then in
the presence of Eight Aldermen of the said City for the time being at the
least, and being called to come forth and give his consent to take the said
Office of Shrievalty upon him, shall not personally before the Lord Mayor and
Court of Aldermen for the time being, in the inner Chamber of Guild Hall
aforesaid, at the next Court there to be holden, unless he have such reasonable
excuse as the Lord Mayor and greater part of the Aldermen for the time being
shall in open Court allow; and then and there become bound to the Chamberlain
of the same City for the time being and his Successors by his Deed Obligatory,
in the Sum of 1000 l. with Condition that if he shall personally appear in the
public assembly in the Guild Hall of the same City on the Vigil of St. Michael
the Archangel then next following, at the time in that behalf accustomed, and
then and there take upon him the Office and charge of Shrievalty of the said
City and County of Middlesex; that then the said Obligation shall be void. Or
if such Person so to be chosen or elected shall before the Lord Mayor and Court
of Aldermen, openly declare his refusal to take upon him the said Office, then
every such person as shall make such default in appearance, or shall not become
bounden, or which shall declare his refusal as aforesaid, shall forfeit the Sum
of 400 l. of lawful Money of England to the Mayor and Comonalty of the same
City to be employed to the uses in the said Act declared and expressed, unless
he shall be duly discharged of the said Office of Shrievalty for want or defect
of ability in Wealth upon Oath taken, as in and by the said Act is mentioned
and directed. Provided, and it is thereby further Enacted, That if the Person
so to be chosen or elected, and making default in appearance or denying to
become bound, or that shall declare his refusal as aforesaid, shall be an
Alderman of this City at the time of his Choice or Election, then every such
Alderman so to be chosen or elected shall forfeit 600 Marks of lawful money of
England to the Mayor and Cominalty of the same City to be employed to the uses
in the said Act declared and expressed. Now forasmuch as the said Penalty of
600 Marks in case of an Alderman chosen to the said Office of Sheriff, and not
appearing or refusing to be bound or to take the same upon him as aforesaid, is
conceived to be too small for the end thereby intended, and is requisite to be
enlarged. Be it therefore Enacted by the Right Honorable the Lord Mayor, the
Right Worshipful the Aldermen, and the Commons in Common Council assembled,
That every Alderman of this City that shall hereafter be chosen or elected one
of the Sheriffs of the said City and County of Middlesex (not having before
served the said Office) and shall not appear the next Court of Aldermen after
such Election, or shall there deny to become bound, or declare his refusal to
take the said Office upon him according to the direction and intent of the said
recited Act; then every such Alderman shall forfeit the Sum of 600 l. of lawful
money of England to the Mayor, and Commonalty and Citizens of the said City, to
be employed to the same uses, and recovered in the same manner as the said 600
Marks is appointed to be employed and recovered in and by the said recited Act.
And forasmuch as Doubts have arisen touching the meaning of the Clause first
before mentioned in the said recited Act, and to the end that no person or
persons that shall hereafter be chosen or elected to the Office of Sheriff of
this City and County of Middlesex, may pretend upon Construction of the said
Act, to exempt him or themselves from taking upon him or them the said Office,
by payment of the Forfeitures in this or the said recited Act contained, but
may notwithstanding be liable to serve the said Office; Be it Enacted by the
Authority aforesaid, That every person and persons, whether Aldermen or
Commoners, being Freemen of the City of London, who shall hereafter be chosen
or elected to be Sheriff or Sheriffs of the said City and County of Middlesex,
and publication be thereof made according to the direction of the said Act, and
by making default in appearance, or denying to become bound, or declaring his
or their refusal, as aforesaid, shall incurr the Forfeitures aforesaid, shall
notwithstanding the said Forfeitures (unless He or They shall upon payment
thereof be by Order of the said Court of Lord Mayor and Aldermen exempted for
that Year from taking upon him or them the said Office) hold the same, and be
presented to the Barons of his Majesty's Exchequer, to be by them amerced in
case of his or their absenting or refusing to take upon Him or Them the said
Office. The aforesaid Act, or any other Act or Acts of this Court, or any Law,
Usage, or Custom of this City to the contrary notwithstanding. Provided always,
and be it Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That no person or persons that
shall hereafter be Chosen or Elected to the Office of Sheriff of the said City
and County, and shall be presented to the Barons of the Exchequer, to the end
He or They may be compelled to take upon Him or Them the said Office, and shall
thereupon take upon Him the said Office, shall be in any wise liable to pay or
be prosecuted for any of the Forfeitures and Penalties in this or the said
recited Act mentioned. Any thing in this or the said Act contained to the
contrary notwithstanding. And whereas it has been an ancient Custom and Usage
in choosing the Sheriffs of the City of London and County of Middlesex,
(allowed and approved by diverse Acts of Common Council) for the Lord Mayor to
elect a Person to be one of the said Sheriffs, and the Commons in Common Hall
to confirm the said Election; And there have been of late great and fierce
Disputes and Contests within this City touching the said Usage, which has
given great Disturbance to very many good Citizens and offense to his Majesty
(upon whose Grace and Favor the welfare of this City so much depends,) and
Fewds and Animosities have thereby arisen, and are still too much continued
among many Citizens, and othee manifold Inconveniences and Mischiefs have been
occasioned thereby to this City, and greater may ensue, if due remedy be not
provided to take away and remove all occasion of the like Differences for the
future. For prevention therefore of the said Mischiefs, and to remove all
Disputes and Controversies that may arise in time to come, touching the
Confirmation of such Person as shall be chosen to be one of the said Sheriffs
by the Lord Mayor for the time being; Be it Declared and Enacted by the
Authority aforesaid, That hereafter the Person who shall be Nominated and
Elected according to ancient Usage by the Lord Mayor of this City for the time
being, to be one of the Sheriffs of the City of London and County of Middlesex,
and such Election shall be declared to the Commons of the said City assembled
in Common Hall upon the 24th Day of June (being the Day appointed by the
afore-recited Act) as well for Confirmation and Allowance of such Person as
shall be chosen and elected by the Lord Mayor to be Sheriff of the said City
and County, as also for the Choice and Election of such other Persons as by the
Lord Mayor, Aldermen and Commons shall be chosen to be Sheriffs of the said
City and County) shall there by the said Commons be Confirmed and allowed to be
one of the Sheriffs of the said City and County accordingly. And that upon
proposing the said Person to be Confirmed to the said Common Hall, in case any
Hands shall be holden up in token of Confirmation, the said Person shall be
taken to be Confirmed and allowed, and then another Person shall be chosen by
Majority of Hands to be the other of the said Sheriffs, and to join with Him
that shall be so confirmed. Any former Law, Usage, or other Matter whatsoever
to the contrary notwithstanding.

Wagstaffe.
