Relating how Five English Frigates, viz. The Henry, Ruby, Antelope, Greyhound,
and Bryan, burnt all the Spanish Ships in their Harbor at Malago; battered

Where ever English Seamen goes,
They are a Terror to their Foes.
To the Tune of, Five Sail of Frigates bound for Malago, etc.


COme all you brave Sailors
that sails on the Main,
I Will tell you of a Fight
that was lately in Spain,
And of five Sail of Frigates
bound to Malago,
For to fight the Proud Spaniards,
our Orders was so:
There was the Henry and Ruby,
and the Antelop also,
The Greyhound, and the Bryan,
for Fireships must go,
But so bravely we weighed,
and played our parts,
That we made the Proud Spaniards,
to quake in their hearts
Then we came to an anchor
so nigh to the Mould,
Methinks you Proud English
do grow very bold:
But we came to an anchor
so near to the Town,
That some of their Churches
we soon battered down.
They hung out their Flag of Truce,
for to know our Intent,
And they sent out their Longboat,
to know what we meant:
But our Captain he answered
them bravely, it was so,
For to burn all your Shipping,
before we do go.
For to burn all our Shipping,
you must us excuse,
It Is not five Sail of Frigates
shall make us to muse.
But we burnt all their Shipping,
and their Galleys also,
And we left in the City
full many a Widow.
Come then, says our Captain,
less fire at the Church;
And down came their Belfrey,
which grieved them much;
And down came the Steeple,
which stands so high;
Which made the Proud Spaniards
to the Nunnery fly.
So great a Confusion
we made in the Town,
That their lofty Buildings
came tumbling down:
Their Wives and their Children
for help they did cry,
But none could relieve them,
though danger was nigh.
The flames and the smoke,
so increased their woe,
That they knew not whither
to run nor to go;
Some to shun the Fire,
leapt into the Flood,
And there they did perish
in Water and Mud.
Our Guns we kept firing,
still shooting amain,
Whilst many a Proud Spaniard
was on the place slain:
The rest being amazed,
for succor did cry,
But all was in vain,
they had no where to fly.
At length being forced,
they thought it most fit,
Unto the brave English Men
for to submit:
And so a conclusion
at last we did make.
Upon such Conditions
as was fit to take.
The Spanish Armado,
did England no harm,
'Twas but a Bravado
to give us alarm;
But with our five Frigates
we did them bumbast,
And made them of English Men's
Valor to taste.
When this noble Victory
we did obtain,
Then home we returned
to England again;
Where we were received,
with Welcomes of Joy,
Because with five Frigates
we did them destroy.
