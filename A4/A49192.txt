LONDON, (...)

THE Wise and learned Speech of the Lord LOWDEN, in the Upper House of
Parliament in Scotland, 1641.
My Lords,
THe great differences between the two Kingdoms, England and Scotland, through
the great mercy of God being now appeased, and an act of oblivion past of all
bygone deeds since the last troubles; we may with cheerfulness and
thankfulness, not only settle all things here at home, which by reason of the
want of the benefit of ordinary judicature, are now out of order, likewise with
all duty and affection to consider of, and assist his Majesty in such matters
and enterprises, as he shall be pleased to propound unto us.

Now first for the difference give me leave to say somewhat of them.

(And indeed) in speaking somewhat of them I may hold my peace, and say nothing
at all, for the truth is, there was no difference between the 2. Kingdoms.

There was troubles and fears on every side, but consider, it was not through
the default of the two Kingdoms, that were like to produce such miserable
effects and calamities as were threatened; But it was the fault of malignant
men, who by their wicked Actions and improvident Counsels, strived (what in
them lay) to sow the seeds of discord and discention betwixt his Royal Majesty
and good Subjects of both Kingdoms, if then these Calamities threatened and
feared, were by ill Instruments wrought, and caused, and that now by the
goodness of the Almighty, the wisdom of his Royal Majesty and prudent
endeavors of the Honorable Assemblies of both Kingdoms, both the cause and
the causers are removed and averted, what cause is there, or can be there
imagined to be, that either Kingdom or any particular member of either, can be
otherwise then really united, in more tender and hearty affection one toward
another, then ever they were.

For our Kingdom of Scotland, however the great Impostures of these troubles,
and scattered false Rumors and reports; both in the ears of his Majesty, and
many of his Loyal and good Subjects, that we should aim altogether at out
own ends, and that all our pretenses were to insinuate both into the hearts
and estates of the Subjects of England; yet J hope it has now fully appeared
to his Majesty, and the Honorable assembly of that Kingdom, and all other his
loving Subjects, that will not be wilfully or maliciously blinded, that we
sought only our own peace, and not the least prejudice, (much less the
ruin) of our Brethren of England, for the truth of this, I dare boldly say; I
may call even the Northern Countries to witness, where our army lay, that
they cannot say that our Soldiers used them as enemies, but as friends, and
that where such an army lay so longtime, there was so little harm done to a
Country, and that little which was done (I hope satisfaction is or shall
suddenly be made) and hope none of his Majesty's good Subjects in England, will
take it to be any dishonor in granting us that sum of money, the Parliament
did, toward our great losses and charges, which have appeared to be more then
douoled; and the summegranted, but a friendly demonstration of one Nation
toward another.

We are Brethren, not enemies, and by ill Instruments were forced both into the
field, having no cause of malice one toward another. Let the mischief then
fall on neither Nation, but on those Instruments, let them be made Exemplary
that was the cause of such Calamities, and great miseries, let the Honor be to
his Majesty, and the wise and prudent Assemblies of both Kingdoms, that have
applied themselves to fair things, and composed the quarrel, without shedding
of blood, and even from a state Gasping, have restored both Kingdoms to their
former unity, Peace and Concord; and disbanded the Armies upon reasonable
conditions; since then, there is such an unity, between both Kingdoms, and
that the Armies are both united, in true hearty affection one toward another,
how considetable may these armies make us abroad, if God shall bless us, then
certainly those armies that were lately ready to offend one another, may show a
Capability with unity of hearts, and well designed may effect great matters,
and may by unity of Council, raise both Kingdoms to as great estimation, and
as great honor in the world, as ever; and how can they be better designed then
to restore the Electorall Family to their former inheritance, can there be a
better cause then the truth of God? Can there be a cause wherein we can be more
interessed, then to assist his Royal Majesty's dearest and only Sister, and
her Royal issue, to obtain their lawful and right Inheritance, out of which
they have been so long time unjustly divested, doubtless, there cannot; now,
to the interest of the cause, let us add his Majesty's proposition, which
makes all complete.

Let us therefore proceed to the perfecting of so Religious, so lawful, and so
laudable a work as this, and no doubt, but our Brethren of England will be as
willing and forward as we being interested in the cause alike as we are, I
shall here, not unfitly make mention of a homely story; I have read of an
Emperor in Turkey, that hearing there was Civil wars in England, had a
design to have taken the advantage of the times, and invaded that Kingdom,
but an Englishman being in some favor and estimation with the Emperor, and
wishing well to his Native Country, caused a couple of Mastive dogs to be set
together by the ears before the Emperor, and as they were fighting, caused a
Bear to be put to them which the Dogs perceiving, left fighting, and fell
both upon the Bear. which the Emperor taking notice of, the Englishman told
him he had caused that to be done, to show him the condition of his Countrymen,
who would fall out among themselves, yet they would take part each with other
against an Enemy; and therefore although they were at varience amongst
themselves, yet it would be little advantage to his intended undertakings,
upon which, the Emperor changed his resolution touching that design.

If then this were the nature of Englishmen; unto whom we now by the
Almighties providence are united under one King, one Nation, and one Island, I
doubt not but the same remains, and although we have been lately ready to
offend each other, yet being now united in more tender and hearty affection,
one toward another then ever we were, shall hold and maintain such a good
correspondence amongst our selves, that shall not only bring both Nations to a
condition of prosperity at home, but make us formydable to our enemies abroad.

FINIS,
