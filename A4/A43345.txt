TO THE READER.
MY Design in this Essay is to promote the singing of Psalms in Families, as a
part of their Daily Worship, especially their Sabbath-Worship; an Exercise
which (however it be now with other Instances of the warmest Devotion sadly
disused, yet) was anciently practiced by the generality of serious Christians,
who thus turned their Houses into Churches, (such Churches as Saint Paul speaks
of, Romans 16.5. (...) 2.) by praising God together, and by teaching and
admonishing one another in singing of Psalms. If we ask for the good Old Way,
we shall f^nd this Path in it trodden by the Primitive Christians in the
Church's early days; among the particulars of whose Religion that Learned Pen,
which wrote the Primitive Christianity, traceth remarkable Footsteps of this
Family-Exercise, Part 1. Chapter 9. The sound of this Melody was not only heard in
their Solemn Assemblies, where it appears by many passages (particularly that
known Account which Pliny gives to Trajan of the Christians, Epist. l. 10.) to
have been a considerable part of their Public Worship, but in their private
Houses also, where it seems to have been the common usage to sing Psalms with
their Wives and Children, especially at and after their Meals; a practice
commended by Clemens Alexandrinus Paedag. lib. 2. c. 4. by Chrysostom in Psalm.
41. which made the Psalms so familiar to them, that, as Jerome tells us ( Epist.
ad Marcel.) in the place where be lived you could not go into the Field but you
should bear the Plow men, and the Mowers, and the Vine-dressers thus employed:
Sonet Psalmos convivium sobrium, says Cyprian. Socrates Hist. Eccles. lib. 7.
cap. 22. speaks of it as the practice of Theodosius the Emperor, to rise early
every morning to sing Psalms with his Sisters; so that his Palace (says he)
was like a Monastery, or Religious House, (...) And I have sometimes thought
that the Service of the Monasteries in the degenerate Ages of the Church (which
is known to have consisted very much in Singing) was but the remaining Form and
Carcass of that Life and Power of Godliness and Religious Worship which had
originally reigned in most Christian Families. That Is a good hint of Tertullian
in his Book ad Uxorem (written about the Year 205.) lib. 2. cap. -- where
cautioning Christian Women not to marry with Unbelievers, he urges this
against it, that those who were so linked, could not have their Husbands to
sing Psalms with them, in their Houses; whereas, when those in that Relation
draw together in the Yoke of Christ, sonant inter duos Psalmi and Hymni, and
mutuo provocant quis melius Deo suo canet; their only strife then is, which
shall be most affectionate and serious in singing Psalms. And to come nearer
our own day, that is worthyour notice which Mr. Quick in the In roduction to
his Synodicon tells us, Vol. 1. p. 5. that the singing of Psalms in Families,
even those of the best. Rank, not only at their Morning and Evening Worship,
but at their Meals, conduced very much to the strength and growth of the
Reformed Religion in France in its first and best days. And the Title page of
our old English Translation of the Psalms into Meter, set forth and allowed at
the beginning of our Reformation, in Edw. the 6th's Time, recommends them to be
sung in private houses for their godly solace and comfort. And how the houses
of the good old Protestants were perfumed with this Incense daily, especially
on Lord's days, we have heard with our Ears, and our Fathers have told us.
Gladly therefore would I contribute something toward the revival of this duty
in Christian Families, which, if they be (as they should be) Nurseries and
Seminaries of Piety, would certainly embrace this as an excellent means of
instilling Religion betimes into the minds of their little Children, who, as
they commonly attend most to this duty, so they will sooner receive the good
impressions of it, than of any other; and thus out of the mouths of Babes and
Sucklings will praise be perfected, to the glory of God, and strength ordained
to the comfort of Families; compare Mat. 21.16. with Psalm. 8.2. Austin (Prolog.
in Lib. Psalm.) suggests, that Psalms were written, and the singing of Psalms
appointed, very much for the sake of Youth. Propterea Psalmorum (says he)
nobis per modulos aptata sunt Carmina, ut vel aetate Puerili, vel qui
Adolescentes sunt moribus, quasi cantilena quadam psallentes delectari
videantur.

What shall I say then to persuade Masters of Families who have hitherto
neglected their duty, to begin it now; Better late than never. The experience
of many that make conscience of it will testify both the sweetness and profit
of it. If Psalms were more sung in Families, they would be better sung in
Congregations. Let none plead want of time as their excuse; for how can time be
spent better than in praising God? And is there not a great deal of our
precious hours thrown away every day upon other things that are less to the
purpose of a Christian? Nor will there be room for this pretense, if care be
taken not to defer Family Worship too late, either morning or evening, so as to
crowd it into a corner (as many do by a thousand impertinences) as likewise so
to proportion the other parts of the duty, that they may not justle out this.
It is the wisdom of Masters of Families, so to manage their Family Worship,
that they may make it, as much as possible, a pleasure, and not a task to their
Children and Servants. Nor let want of skill be an excuse; there may be much of
acceptable Affection, where there appears but little of Art. Plain Song best
befits plain Israelites. A small degree of skill (and that easily attained by
any that give their minds to it) will suffice to the management of this duty
decently and in order, and more there needs not; for in private Families the
quickest way of singing seems to be most agreeable; such singing as the Great
Athanasius appointed in the Church of Alexandria, ut pronunciani vicinior esset
quam canenti, more like reading than singing. So Austin tells us, Confess. lib.
10. cap. 33. and approves of it as a good means to preserve that spiritual
delight which should be in this Ordinance, from degenerating into a sensitive
pleasure, which it is apt to do when Tunes and Notes are overmuch studied and
affected, and the Ear tickled with them.

Nor let any be afraid that their Neighbors should over-hear them: We serve a
Master that we have no reason to be ashamed of, to whom we have engaged, that
whatever others do, we and our houses will serve him; and whose hold is so
great of the Consciences even of bad men, that those whose contempt and
reproach you fear, even of them perhaps you will be had in honor, 2 Samuel 6.22.
Nay, your Light hereby may so shine before men, that others may be brought to
glorify your Father which is in Heaven, Mat. 5.16.

If any make it an excuse that they are unready in finding out such Psalms, or
passages in the Psalms, as are most proper for Family use, such may perhaps
receive some help from this small Collection.

It is taken out of David's Psalms, and further we seldom need to go for Hymns
and Spiritual Songs, though other Scriptures may, no doubt, be used this way
much to edification. Nolite cantare nisi quod legit is esse cantandum, is a
good Rule which Austin gives Epist. 109. This Collection will be the more
useful (and it is what I chiefly aim at in it) if every one in the Family have
a Book, so that the Psalm or Hymn (for the distinction is but nominal) may be
sung without reading the Line betwixt, which is the general practice of the
Reformed Churches abroad, and renders the duty more pleasant and profitable,
and takes up less time, and is practicable enough in a Family, if not in large
Congregations.

The gathering of Verses out of several Psalms, and putting them together, may
seem to be a violation of their own native coherence. But I hope it will not
give offense to any, since it is no more so, than the joining of several
passages of Scriptures remote from each other, and putting them together in our
Prayers and Sermons, which is generally practiced: Besides that, it is a
liberty which is often taken by the Clarks that give out the Psalms in public;
And I think those who dislike it not there, will the rather allow it in private
Families. Nay, I am in h^pes that the reference. I have made all along to the
Psalms and Verses, will increase and lead to an acquaintance with the Book of
Psalms in general, which I would not that this Essay should at all lessen or
supersede.

I have made use of the best approved Translations, especially Mr. Patrick's,
and Mr. Barton's; as likewise Bishop King's, Mr. Smith's, Dr. Ford's, and Mr.
Baxter's, who have each of them labored well in this Province; nor have I
neglected the Old Translation, which considering the Age in which it was done,
and that it broke the Ice, is not such a contemptible piece us some love to
represent it. I have taken that out of each which I judged the best and most
suitable to my purpose, acting herein not as a Censor, but as a Gleaner. Books
are known to have their Fate ad captum Lectoris, and therefore I hope my pardon
for making this use of the Labors of others will be easily granted, and this
general Acknowledgment will suffice to acquit me from the Charge of Plagiarism.
I have not varied at any time from my Authors merely for variation sake, yet
throughout I have seen cause very often to alter, and in many places to build
anew (especially where I was willing to contract) according to the best of my
skill. The performance indeed is but very small, yet the Design is honest, and
it will be fruit abounding to a good account, if it do but help forward the
work of singing Psalms, in which the will of God is done on Earth somewhat like
as it is done in Heaven, where singing Hallelujahs to him that sits upon the
Throne, and unto the Lamb, is both the everlasting work, and the everlasting
felicity of those glorified Beings.

For Morning Worship.
Hymn 1. Psalm. 57.7, 8.
MY heart is now prepared for praise
It Is fixed for the same;
And I will sing to thee, O Lord,
And bless thy Holy Name.
Awake my Glory, Lute, and Harp,
Consorts of praise to make,
Now in the morning I my self
Will to this work awake.
-- 19.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
The Heavens, throughout their vast extent,
Declare their Maker's praise;
The glittering starry Firmament
His handiwork displayes.
Day unto day does celebrate,
and night to night proclaim,
Without the help of speech or tongue,
His universal Fame.
There does the Sun with joy and strength
His constant course complete,
The Earth rejoices in his Light,
And in his quickening Heat.
-- 90.17.
So Let the Lord shine on our Souls,
Lighten and warm us thus:
Prosper, O God, our handy-works,
And stablish them to us.
Hymn II. -- 118.15. -- 3.5.
THE voice of saving Health and Joy
In Just (...) dwellings is;
The Lord's right hand works powerfully,
That strong right hand of his.
I laid me down, and sweetly slept,
And safely waked again,
Because it was the Lord that kept,
And did my Soul sustain.
-- 31.21. -- 30.5.
Blessed be God's most sacred Name,
Who has such wonders shown,
Wonders of Love securing me,
As in a fenced Town.
His wrath is in a moment past,
Life from his favor springs;
Though weeping for a night may last,
The morning comfort brings.
-- 33.20, 21, 22.
Therefore we wait for thee, O Lord,
Who still art our defense;
In all Estates we trust in thee,
With cheerful confidence.
Lord, let thy Grace on us descend,
Like a refreshing shower;
For all our Hopes and Joys depend
On thine Almighty Power.
Hymn III. Psalm. 74.16, 17.
THE shining day, and shady night,
Peculiarly are thine;
Thou have, O Lord, prepared the Light,
And caused the Sun to shine.
The Earth with all its Ends and Coasts;
Thy mighty hand did ^ame,
Both Summer's heat, and Winter's frost,
By thine appointment came.
-- 33.6, 7. -- 119.91.
By thy Great Word the Heavens were made;
And all their Hosts are thine;
The gathered Waters of the Sea
Thou do in bounds confine.
According to thine Ord'nance, these
Continue to this day;
For all are Servants unto thee,
And do thy Word obey.
Rev. 4.11. Psalm. 124.8.
Glory and Honor must, O Lord,
To thee of right be paid,
For all these things are by thy power,
And for thy pleasure made.
And our continual Hope and Help,
In his Great Name does stand,
Who did create both Heaven and Earth
By his Almighty hand.
Hymn IV. Psalm. 121.1, -- 8.
UP to the Hills I lift mine Eyes,
From whence I look for Aid;
In God alone my succor lies,
That Earth and Heaven made.
He will sustain thy weaker powers,
With his Almighty Arm,
And keep thee with continual care,
From all surprising harm.
The Great Protector of the Saints,
He slumbers not, nor sleeps;
The Lord thy shade on thy right hand
Thy Soul in safety keeps;
So that thy head, the scorching Sun
By day shall never smite,
Nor th'Moon's hurtful influence
Distemper thee by night.
The Lord shall save thee from all Ill,
And keep thy Soul from sin,
He shall preserve thy going out,
And bless thy coming in.
Hymn V. Psalm. 115.1, 8, 9.
LORD, not to us, but to thy Name
Be given the praise we owe,
To thy rich Goodness, and thy Truth,
Whence all our Blessings flow.
Whilst Heathens worship senseless Gods,
Such senseless Fools they be;
Let Israel trust the Living God,
Our help and shield is He.
-- 115.12, 13, 14, 17, 18.
The Lord has had us in his mind,
And he will bless us still,
Even Israel's house, and Aaron's too,
With blessings he shall fill.
Them that be fearers of the Lord,
He Will bless them great and small;
God shall increase you more and more,
You and your Children all.
The dead indeed praise not the Lord,
They give him no Renown,
Nor do they thus declare his Name
To silence that go down.
We therefore that are yet alive,
His praises will record,
From this time forth for ever more
Amen. Praise ye the Lord.
Hymn VI. Psalm. 101.1, -- 7.
MErcy and Judgment in my Song,
United (Lord) shall be;
And since from thee they both do flow,
I Will sing of both to thee.
I Will wisely walk in perfect ways;
When will thou come to me,
To dwell, and rule (Lord) in my house,
And bless my Family?
And that thou may be still my guest,
No sin I will abide,
But will abandon all the works
Of them that turn aside.
Him that persists in wicked ways
I Will from my house discard,
No proud or scornful ones befriend,
Or in the least regard.
I will look out the faithful men,
That they may dwell with me,
And such as walk in righteous ways,
My Servants they shall be.
I will no guileful person, have,
Within my walls to dwell,
Nor in my sight will I abide
The man that Lies does tell.
105.45.
That we the better may observe
The Statutes of his Word,
And from his Precepts may not swerve,
O magnify the Lord!
Hymn VII. Psalm. 127.1, 2.
EXcept the Lord do build the house,
Vain are the pains of man;
Except the Lord the City guard,
No other Watchman can.
Your rising early will not do,
Night-watching frujtless is,
And eating still the bread of care,
While God gives sleep to his.
-- 37.4, 5.
Therefore delight thy self in God,
To him by Faith retire,
And he shall wisely bring about
Thy very heart's desire.
Commit thy way unto the Lord,
On him by Faith depend,
And he shall bring thy just designs
Unto a happy end.
16.23, 24
A little that the Just enjoys
Is better far to them
Than all the ill-got, ill-spent wealth
Of many wicked men.
The Lord that guides a good man's steps,
Delights in his way;
He is not ruined by his falls,
For God will be his stay.
25.35, 36, 37.
In all my life I never yet
That liberal man could see,
Whose Alms reduced himself to want,
Or his to Beggary.
I Have seen the wicked rise and spread
Like Laurels fresh and green,
Till total Ruin swept him off,
As if he never had been.
Mark and behold the perfect man
That Is upright in his ways,
Mercy attends his happy Life,
And Peace concludes his days.
Hymn VIII. Psalm. 16.1, 2, 3.
LORD save me, for I trust in thee
With all my mind and heart;
To thee my Soul has often said,
My Lord, my God thou art.
My goodness never can extend
To thee, O Lord, above;
But to thine exc'llent Saints on Earth
Whom I entirely love.
5, 6.
God is my Portion, all my good
From his rich Mercy flows,
And his kind Providence secures
The Blessings he bestows.
I envy not the Great man's State,
Nor pine to see his store;
With what I have I Am pleased much,
With what I hope for, more.
7, 8.
I bless the Lord who did direct
My Soul to choose aright,
On which my secret thoughts reflect
With comfort every night.
I still conceived the Lord to stand
Before me as my Guide,
While he does stand at my right hand
I know I shall not slide.
9, 10, 11.
Therefore my Heart and Tongue rejoice,
In him my Flesh shall trust;
My Soul shall not remain in Hell,
Nor Body in the Dust:
The Path of Life they both shall find,
And in thy Presence taste
Pleasures to full perfection grown,
And Joys that ever last.
Hymn IX. Psalm. 112.1, 2.
PRaise ye the Lord, for blessed are those
That fear the Lord aright,
That greatly love his Sacred Laws,
And do them with delight.
The upright man's successful seed
On Earth shall mighty grow,
To all that from his Loins descend
Shall special Blessings flow.
3, 4.
Riches and Wealth shall in his house
Abound from day to day,
Whilst Graces do adorn his Soul,
More durable than they.
In midst of darkness, to the Just
There springs a joyful Light;
Gracious he is, compassionate,
And every way upright.
5, 6, 7.
He lends assistance to the Poor,
Discreetly guides his way;
Nothing shall ever move the Just,
Nor make his Name decay:
For any evil tidings told
He shall not be afraid,
But trusting in the Lord alone;
His heart is fixed and staid.
-- 128.4, 5, 6.
Thou art then blessed that fear God,
And he shall let thee see
The promised Jerusalem,
And her felicity.
Thou shall thy Children's Children see,
To thy great Joys increase,
Whilst on God's Israel there shall rest
Prosperity and Peace.
Hymn X. Psalm. 5.3. -- 130.3, 4.
LORD, thou shall hear my morning-cry,
At morning it shall be,
That I Will by Faith direct my Prayer,
And wll look up to thee.
If thou should mark iniquities,
Then who should stand, O Lord?
But there is forgiveness (Lord) with thee,
That thou may be adored.
-- 51.9, 10. -- 17.5.
Lord hide thine Eyes from all my sin,
And my misdeeds deface;
O God make clean my heart within,
Renew my mind with Grace.
Uphold my goings, Lord, my Guide,
In all thy Paths divine,
That I may never step aside,
Out of those ways of thine.
-- 27.11. -- 141.3.
Lord, let me plainly see thy way,
Where I may safely tread,
Avoiding all the cunning snares
Mine Enemies have laid.
And set a constant watch before
My hasty Mouth, O Lord;
And of my Lips keep thou the door,
Against each evil word.
-- 19.12, 13, 14.
For who can all his Errors see,
And what lies hid within?
Lord cleanse me, and deliver me
From all my secret sin.
From bold presumptions keep me back,
Lest they Dominion gain,
So shall I shun the great offense,
And upright shall remain.
Accept my Mouth, accept my Heart,
My words and thoughts each one;
For my Redeemer and my Strength,
O Lord, thou art alone.
Hymn XI. Psalm. 25.5, 7
To the Tune of Psalm. 67.
LORD lead me in thy Truth,
And teach me in thy Way;
For thou my God and Savior art,
On thee I wait all day.
My youthful sins and faults,
O keep not on record;
In mercy, for thy goodness sake,
Remember me, O Lord.
8, 10.
The Lord is good and just,
And therefore takes delight
To teach poor sinners in his way,
That they may walk aright.
For all the ways of God
Are Mercy, Truth and Grace,
To them that keep his Covenant,
And his Commands embrace.
12, 13.
What man does fear the Lord,
And dread the paths of sin,
The Lord himself shall choose his way,
And guide his steps therein.
Possessed with quiet thoughts,
His Soul shall dwell at ease;
His Happy Offspring shall possess
The promised Land of Peace.
14, 21, 22.
The secret of the Lord
Shall all that fear him know,
His Counsel and his Covenant
He to his Saints will show.
Let mine integrity
And uprightness defend
And keep me; for in Faith and Hope
On thee I do depend.
Lord, by thy power redeem,
And bring thy People out
From all the straits and miseries
That compass them about.
Hymn XII. Psalm. 23.1, 2, 3.
MY Shepherd is the Lord most high,
I shall be well supplied,
In Pastures green he makes me lie,
By silent Waters side.
He does restore my Soul that strays,
And then he leads me on,
To walk in his most righteous ways,
For his Name's sake alone.
4, 5, 6.
Yea though through Death's dark Vale I go,
Yet will I fear no ill,
Thy Rod and Staff support me so,
And thou art with me still.
My Table thou have furnished
In presence of my Foe;
With Oil thou do anoint my head,
My Cup does overflow.
Surely thy Goodness and thy Grace,
Shall always follow me;
And my perpetual dewlling place
Thy Holy House shall be.
-- 28. last.
Lord save thy People pow'rfully,
And bless thine Heritage;
Feed them likewise, and raise them high,
Henceforth from Age to Age.
For Evening Worship.
Hymn XIII. Psalm. 68.19, 20.
BLessed be God that does us load
With daily favors thus;
Even that God that has bestowed
Salvation upon us.
For our God is the God alone
From whom Salvation is;
The Issues and Escapes from death
Are all and only his.
-- 34.3, 4, 5, 6.
O magnify the Lord with me,
And let us praise his Name,
Who heard my prayers, observed my fears,
And saved me from the same.
Who does regard with Favor those
That him by Faith regard;
Who poor afflicted Souls has saved,
And all their cries has heard.
-- 66.9. -- 34.20. -- 35.10.
Woe setting dangers all aside,
Our Soul in life does stay,
And suffering not our foot to slide,
Upholds us in our way.
Who keeps all his People's bones,
That they unbroken be:
Therefore my bones shall all confess,
Lord, who is like to thee!
Hymn XIV. Psalm. 34.7, 8, 9.
THE Angel of the Lord most high
Encampeth every where,
About the Saints, deliv'ring them
That walk in God's true fear.
O taste and see that God is good,
And in his Grace confide;
For unto those that fear his Name
No good shall be denied.
-- 116.7. -- 31.5.
Return, my Soul, that art set free,
Return unto thy Rest,
For graciously the Lord to thee
His Bounty has expressed.
Lord God of Truth, my precious Soul
I to thy hands commit,
That Sp'rit which is by purchase thine,
For thou redeemedst it.
-- 17.8, 15.
Preserve me, Lord, from hurtful things
As The Apple of thine Eye,
And under covert of thy wings
Defend me secretly.
I shall in righteousness behold
Thy reconciled Face;
And waking shall be satisfied
With The Image of thy Grace.
Hymn XV. Psalm. 91.1, 4, 5.
HE that for his secure retreat
Has chosen the Most High,
Shall underneath The Almighty's shade
Abide continually,
Under his sheltering wings concealed
Thou shall be safe and warm;
Terrors by night thou shall not fear,
Nor dread the Noon-day's Harm.
9, 10.
Because thou made the Lord Most High
Thy constant home to be,
The same to whom I always fly,
To shield and succor me;
No evil shall to thee betide,
Whatever comes to pass;
Nor shall there any Plague at all
Come nigh thy dewlling place.
11, 12, 14, 15, 16.
Angels shall be thy faithful Guards,
Being charged by his commands
To keep thee safe in all thy ways,
And bear thee in their hands.
Because he knew and loved my Name,
Therefore, faith God, will I
Answer his prayers, deliver him,
And set him up on high.
I will be with him in his griefs,
Honor him with my Love,
Suffice him with long Life on Earth,
And endless Joys above.
Hymn XVI. Psalm. 4.1, 2.
O God that art my Righteousness,
Hear when I call to thee,
For in the day of my distress
Thou have enlarged me.
O mortal men, how long will ye
My Glory thus despise?
Why wander ye in Vanity,
And follow after Lies?
3, 4.
Know ye that good and godly men
The Lord does take and choose,
And when to him I do complain
He does me not refuse.
Then stand in awe, and do not sin,
But set your selves apart,
And silent on your Beds begin
To commune with your heart.
5, 6.
Offer to God the Sacrifice
Of Love and Righteousness,
And then put all your trust in him
For succor in distress.
Many take up with any good,
And worldly things embrace,
But we desire of thee, O God,
The shining of thy Face.
7, 8.
For thou thereby shall make my heart
More joyful and more glad,
Than they that of their Corn and Wine
A great increase have had.
In peace therefore will I lie down
To take my rest and sleep,
For thou only wilt me, O Lord,
Alone in safety keep.
Hymn XVII. Psalm. 141.1, 2.
TO thee, O Lord, I call and cry,
Make haste and come to me;
Give ear unto my humble voice,
Now when I cry to thee.
O let my prayer be now set out
As Incense in thine Eyes;
And the up-lifting of my hands
As th'Ev'ning Sacrifice.
-- 119.147, 148.162. -- 130.6.
I did prevent the dawning day,
In crying to the Lord,
And have engaged my waking thoughts
To med'tate in thy Word.
Thy righteous Judgments I will praise
In the dark, silent night,
And thus my Soul shall wait for thee
More than to see the Light.
-- 63.5, 7.
In thee my Soul shall be sufficed
As if with fullness filled,
And thankful praise my mouth always
With joyful Lips shall yield.
Since thou alone art he from whom
My help proceeds and springs,
Therefore will I rest joyfully
Under thy shady wings.
Hymn XVIII. Psalm. 106.4. -- 118.25.
THink on us Lord with favor free,
Such as thy People find;
With thy Salvation visit us,
And have us in thy mind.
Save now, we do beseech thee, Lord,
We pray thee earnestly,
Now to afford thy Grace, O Lord,
And send Prosperity.
-- 144.12, 13.
That so our Sons may thrive apace,
As Plants in youth do grow,
Like polished Stones of some fair place,
So may our Daughters show.
That our enlarged Garners may
With precious Stores be filled;
And in our Streets the fruitful Flocks
May many thousands yield.
14, 15.
Let not our la'^'ring Oxen faint,
Nor Enemy invade;
No leading captive, no complaint
Within our Streets be made.
O happy People! would we say,
With all these Blessings stored;
Yea rather happy People they
Whose God is God the Lord.
-- 48. last.
This God is evermore our God,
Our Covenant God is he,
Even unto death, and beyond death
Our faithful Guide he will be.
Hymn XIX. Psalm. 116.1, 2, 7, 8.
GOD that so gracious a regard
To my requests did give,
Shall have my best and choicest Love
And Service while I live.
God and thy self, my Soul, enjoy,
Quiet and free from fears;
He saved thy life, upheld thy steps,
And dried up all thy tears.
12, 13, 16.
What shall I render; Lord, for all
The kindness thou have shown?
Praises I Will offer, and with thanks
Will all thy favors own.
Truly I am thy Servant, Lord,
Thy Servant I will be,
Born in thy house, and from my bonds
By thy good hand set free.
-- 42.8, 11.
Therefore will God command for me
His kindest Love by day;
His Song shall be by night with me,
To God my Life I Will pray.
Why art thou then cast down, my Soul,
With sorrows over-prest?
Why do despairing thoughts disturb
Thy peace, and break my rest?
Have Faith in God, for yet shall I
Sing forth his praise divine;
He to my Countenance is health,
He Is God, and shall be mine.
Hymn XX. Psalm.138.1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
With my whole heart before the Gods
I will with praise proclaim
That word of Love and Truth, which is
Greater than all thy Name.
With spiritual strength thou answer'st me,
And thou shall have thy praise
From Princes all that hear thy Word,
And sing on all thy ways.
6, 7, 8.
Though God be high, he likes the low,
But proud men he disdains,
Therefore in midst of dangers great
My quickening hope remains.
The Lord will perfect mine affairs,
So sure thy mercy stands;
Forsake not Lord, but succor still
The work of thine own hands.
-- 97.11, 12.
Since the immortal seeds of Light
For upright men are sown,
A joyful Harvest will at length
Their work and sorrows crown.
Then let our constant Joys declare
The God we serve is kind,
We'll praise him for his mercies past,
And wait for those behind.
Hymn XXI. Psalm. 139.1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
LORD thou have searched my inward part,
And all my thoughts have known;
Thou see me sit, thou see me rise,
Walking and lying down.
All my close ways, all my quick words
Thou, Lord, do understand,
Behind, before thou have beset,
And on me laid thine hand.
7, 8, 9, 10.
Whither can I retire from thee,
Or from thy presence fly?
For neither Heaven nor Hell can hide
From thine All-seeing Eye.
Could I remove to the utmost Sea
Winged with the morning Ray,
Thy hand that must support my flight,
Would my abode betray.
11, 12, 13, 14, 15.
In vain I seek to lie concealed
I'th'darkness of the night,
For midnight darkness shines to thee
As clear as noonday light.
Maker and Master of my Reins
Thou did at once become;
Blessed Lord, how strangely was I framed
And formed in the womb!
17, 18, 23, 24,
How precious are the thoughts of Love,
Thou do to me express!
Deep in themselves, but dear to me,
And they are numberless.
When I awake I Am still with thee,
And thus to thee I cry,
Search me, O God, and know my heart,
My thoughts and Conscience try;
And see if I do go astray
In any course of sin;
Show me the everlasting way,
And lead me, Lord, therein.
Hymn XXII. Psalm. 103.1, 2, 3.
Bless thou the living Lord, my Soul,
His glorious praise proclaim,
Let all my inward powers extol
And bless his holy Name.
Forget not all his benefits,
But bless the Lord, my Soul,
Who all thy trespasses remits,
And makes thee sound and whole.
4, 5, 8, 9, 10.
Who did redeem thy life from death,
And crowned thee with his Love;
Renewed thy Youth, and filled thy Mouth
With goodness from above.
The Lord is kind, to anger slow,
Ready to pardon sin,
Deals not with us in constant wrath
As our deserts have been.
11, 12. -- 94.19.
As Heaven is high above the Earth,
So is his Cov'nant-Love;
Further than East is from the West
He does our sins remove.
Thus in the crowd and multitude
Of various thoughts, which roll,
Within my breast these comforts rest,
And do delight my Soul.
Hymn XXIII. Psalm. 65.1, 2, 3.
To the Tune of Psalm. 67.
O God, Praise waits still
For thee in Sion Hill;
The Vow will be performed to thee,
And readily fulfill.
O Thou whose Titles are,
The God that hear prayer,
The God to whom all flesh shall come,
To thee do we repair.
Our sins have born great sway,
And much against us say,
But as for these, Lord, thou shall please
To purge them all away.
-- 143.8.
Cause me to hear thy Love
Before the break of day.
Cause me to know which way to go,
For thou art all my stay.
-- 56.12, 13.
Thy Vows upon me lie,
Lord, I will pay the same;
And I always will render praise
To thy most holy Name.
For thou my Soul have saved
From death so near at hand,
And wilt not thou uphold me now,
And make my feet so stand?
That I may still proceed
To walk as in thy sight,
And spend my days unto thy praise,
With them that live in Light.
-- 150.6.
Let every breathing thing
Be ready to record
The praise and same of God's great Name;
Amen. Praise ye the Lord.
Hymn XXIV. Psalm. 8.1, 2.
O Lord, our Lord, through all the Earth,
How exc'llent is thy Name!
Who have thy Glory so adorned
Above the Heavens high frame.
Weak Babes and Sucklings thou ordain'st
Thy power and praise to show;
To still thereby the Enemy,
And the avengeful Foe.
3, 4, 5.
When to thine Heavens I lift mine Eye,
The Palace thou did rear,
And the bright Moon and Stars observe
Ordained to govern there:
Lord, what is Man that he should have
In thy kind thoughts a place,
That thou should thus advance and bless
His mean and mortal Race!
Litt'e below the Angels high
He stands in Glory placed;
Whilst all the Creatures here below
Under his Feet are cast.
-- 73.25, 26.
But whom have I in Heaven but thee?
Nor is there any one
In all the Earth desired of me,
Except thy self alone.
For when my flesh and heart do fail,
Then God upholds my heart;
He is my strength for evermore,
My portion and my part.
27, 28.
For they that far estranged be,
Lo, they, and every one
That goes a whoring, Lord, from thee,
Shall quite be overthrown.
But it is good for me always
That I to God draw nigh,
Then shall I praise his Truth and Love,
When I on him rely.
For the Lord's Day Morning.
Hymn XXV. Psalm. 118.1, 2, 3, 4.
GIve thanks to God, for he is good,
His Mercies still endure;
Let all the Seed of Israel say,
His Promises are sure.
Let Aaron's House confess this day,
His Goodness still prevails;
Let them that fear the Lord now say,
His Kindness never fails.
22, 23.
For that same Stone which men refused,
Despised and trampled on,
Is chosen and preferred to be
The Head, and Corner Stone.
This is the work of our great God,
He did the thing devise,
And he this great Salvation wrought
That Is wondrous in our Eyes.
24, 25.
This is the joyful day indeed,
Which God has Holy made,
Has made for Man, and we will now
With holy mirth be glad.
We'll join our Acclamations now,
And loud Hosanna's sing,
Wishing prosperity may wait
On our Anointed King.
26, 27, 28, 29.
Bless Savior! that from God to us
On this kind Errand came,
We welcome thee, and bless all those
That spread thy glorious Name.
God is the Lord who gives the Light
Which this high day adorns,
Come bind the Sacrifice with Cords
Unto the Altar's Horns.
Thou art my God whom I Will exalt,
My God whom I will praise;
Give thanks to God for he is good,
His mercy lasts always.
Hymn XXVI. Psalm. 84.1, 2, 3.
How lovely is the place where thou
Thy Presence (Lord) do grant!
O! how I long t'approach thy Courts,
Impatient of restraint!
I envy much the Sparrow's place,
And grudge the Swallow's bliss,
That build their Nests in God's own Courts,
My King, my God he is.
4, 5, 6, 7.
Happy the dwellers in thine house,
For they will praise thee still:
Thrice happy they whose strength thou art.
Whose hearts thy Graces fill.
Who make the best of Sion's ways,
And go from strength to strength,
Till they appear before the Lord
In Sion Hill at length.
8, 9, 10.
Lord God of Hosts hear thou my prayer,
O Jacob's God give ear,
O Lord our shield behold the face
Of thine Anointed Dear.
For in thy Courts thy Name to praise,
I count a day spent there
Far better than a thousand days,
A thousand days elsewhere.
There would I rather be confined,
And at the threshold lie
Than dwell in Sinners Tents with Ease
And boundless Liberty.
11, 12.
For God the Lord is Sun and Shield,
He Grace and Glory gives,
And no good thing shall he withold
From them that purely live.
O Lord of Hosts, that man is blessed,
And happy sure is he
Whose heart by Faith does ever rest
With confidence in thee.
Hymn XXVII. Psalm. 27.4.
THIS is my great request, O God,
Which here I do present,
That all the days I have to live
May in thy House be spent.
There to contemplate and behold
The Beauty of the Lord,
And in his Temple to enquire
Into his holy Word.
8, 9.
Whenas thou said, My face seek ye,
Instructed by thy Grace,
My ready heart with Joy replied,
Lord, I will seek thy face.
Hide not thy face from me in wrath;
Lord, turn me not away.
My Sav'our, thou have been my help,
Be still my strength and stay.
-- 43.3, 4.
O send out Light and Truth divine
To lead and bring me near,
Unto that holy Hill of thine,
And Tabernacles there.
Then to God's Altar I will go,
The Gladness of my Joy,
O God my God, thy praise to show,
My Harp I will employ.
-- 119.32.
And I will run with full consent
The way thou giv'st in charge,
When with thy sweet encouragement
Thou shall my heart enlarge.
Hymn XXVIII. Psalm. 92.1, 2, 4.
O What a pleasant work it is
To praise the Lord above,
Morning and Evening to proclaim
His Faithfulness and Love!
Thy works, O Lord, with Joy divine,
My ravished heart affect,
And in the glory of thy Acts
My Triumphs I Will erect.
5, 6, 7.
O Lord, how great are all thy works!
Thy thoughts are all profound;
The Foolish men mistake thy ways,
These Depths they cannot found!
When prosp'ring sinners flourish most,
And as the Grass do spring,
It Is that they may upon themselves
A swift destruction bring.
12, 13.
But Saints like laden Palms shall thrive,
So flourish and come on,
Grow strong and tall, like Cedar Trees
In fruitful Lebanon.
Trees planted in the Holy Place
Where God the Lord does dwell,
Still watered with the dews of Grace,
Shall thrive and prosper well;
14, 15.
Yea (even when Nature's strength decays)
In Ages much fruit shall bring,
And in the Winter of their days
Be fat and flourishing.
To show that God's an upright God,
He is a Rock to me;
And there is no unrighteousness
In him, nor none can be.
Hymn XXIX. Psalm. 96.1, 2.
SIng ye with praise unto the Lord,
New Songs of Joy and Mirth:
Sing to the Lord with one accord,
All People of the Earth.
Sing to the Lord, isthron'd on high,
Bless his adored Name,
The great Salvation he has wrought
From day to day proclaim.
-- 98.1, 2.
Renew your Songs to God, and tell
What wonders he has done;
Let Us all admire the Victories
His Holy Arm has won.
His mercy which was kept before
A secret and enclosed,
Now to the clear and open view
Of Heathen is exposed.
3, 4, 5, 6.
His promised Goodness and his Truth
Was first to Israel shown,
But now the ends of The Earth have seen
His great Salvation.
Let all the Earth this Welcome news
Applaud with loudest noise,
Join Music to their Hymns of Praise
To testify their Joys.
7, 8, 9.
Let swelling Seas roar, and excite
The Joys of neighboring Lands;
Let echoing Hills the noise repeat,
And Rivers clap their hands.
Whole Nature well may feel a change,
When God's approach is nigh,
Who comes to judge and rule the World
With Truth and Equity.
Hymn XXX. Psalm. 68.4, 17.
SIng unto God, sing forth his p^^ise,
Extol him with your Voice.
That rides on th'Heav'ns by JAll his Name,
In which we will rejoice.
God's Char'ots twenty thousand are;
Always before his face
Millions of Angels do attend,
As in the Holy Place.
18.
Thou have ascended up on high,
And thou, O Christ, did then
Lead Captive our Captivity,
Receiving Gifts for Men:
Yea, even for Rebellious men
Thou did those Gifts receive,
That God the Lord might dwell with them,
And they Rebellion leave.
24, 28.
For they have seen thy Power, O God,
They saw thy steps of Grace,
The goings of my God, my King,
Within his Holy Place.
Thy God by his supreme command
Has strengthened thee thus;
Strengthen, O God, by thy good hand
What thou have wrought for us.
34, 35.
Ascribe ye strength to our great God,
Whose excellency rare,
Is over Israel's Land displayed,
Whose strength the Clouds declare.
They that in Holy Places see
Thy Glory, are amazed,
The God of Israel gives us strength,
His Holy Name be praised.
Hymn XXXI. Psalm. 95.1, 2, 3, 4.
COme let us sing with joyful noise
To our Salvation's Rock,
With Psalms of Praise, and thankful Joys,
Into his presence flock.
A God, a King of great command,
A King of Gods He is;
The Earth's great Deeps are in his hand,
The strength of Hills is his.
5, 6, 7.
Dry Land and Seas, even both of these
His hands did form and frame;
O come adore with bended knees
The Lord our Maker's Name.
For he is our God, and we the Flock
Of whom he has command,
His People, and his Pasture-stock,
And Sheep of his own hand.
8, 9, 10, 11.
Let Us therefore hear his Voice to day,
And not hard-hearted prove,
As those that in the Wilderness
Provoked God above.
They proved his power, and saw his works,
And long they grieved him there,
Till wearied with that murmuring Race
He could no longer bear:
But did in just and holy wrath
By solemn Oath protest,
That they should never come into
The Blessed Canaan's Rest.
Heb. 4.1.
Let us then fear left a like Rest
Being proposed to us,
Any of us through unbelief
Come short and perish thus.
Hymn XXXII. Psalm. 36.7, 8.
HOW excellent, Lord, is that Grace,
And Love that from thee springs,
Therefore the Sons of Men do place
Their Trust in thy spread wings!
With fatness of thine House on high
Thou shall thy Saints suffice,
And make them drink abundantly
The River of thy Joys.
9, 10.
Because the Springs of Life most pure
Do ever flow from thee;
And in thy Light-we shall be sure
Eternal Light to see.
To those who thus esteem thy Love,
Thy Kindness still impart,
And all thy Promises fulfill
To men of upright heart.
-- 89.15, 16.
Blessed is the People that does know
And hear the joyful sound,
Thy Beams shall light them as they go,
And shine about them round.
Th'expressions of thy wondrous Love
Will constant Joys create.
And thou, the Glory of their strength
Wilt crown their low Estate.
-- 65.4. -- 41.13.
They with the Goodness of thy House
Shall feast their Appetites;
Full of the Joys thy Temple yields,
And ravished with Delights.
The Lord the God of Israel
Be praised eternally,
From age to age for evermore,
Amen, Amen, say I.
Hymn XXXIII. Psalm. 123.1. -- 26.8. -- 5.7.
TO thee, O Lord, to thee alone
Do I lift up mine Eyes,
O thou the high and lofty One
That dwell'st above the Skies.
The Habitation of thine House,
Lord, I have loved well,
And that sweet place so glorious,
Where thy Renown does dwell.
And to that House will I draw near
In thine abundant Grace,
And worship with an awful fear
Toward thine Holy Place.
-- 119.5, 11, 12, 18, 19.
Assist me therefore, O my God,
And so direct my way,
That I may keep thy holy Word,
And never go astray.
Let it be hid within my heart,
From sin to keep me free,
A blessed One, O Lord, thou art,
Thy Statutes teach thou me.
Open mine Eyes that I may see
The wonders of thy Law,
For b'ing a stranger here, I must
From thence my comfort draw.
24, 54.
And these thy Testimonies are
My heart's entire delight,
Nor need I other Counselor
To guide my ways aright.
For every where thy Statutes are
My comfortable Songs,
Whilst in my Pilgrimage I am
Exposed to griefs and wrongs.
Hymn XXXIV. Psalm. 119.68, 73.
LORD thou art good, and thou do good,
All Graces flow from thee;
Teach me to know thy Testaments,
How good and just they be.
Thy hands have made, and fashioned me,
Thy Grace on me bestow,
To know thy Precepts what they be,
And practice what I know.
105, 106, 108.
For of my Life they are the Guide,
And to my Paths give Light;
I Have sworn to keep thy Right'ous Laws,
Which I Will perform aright.
The Free Will Offerings of my Mouth
I pray thee Lord accept,
And teach me now, which way and how
Thy Judgments may be kept.
109, 111.
My Soul is ever in my hand,
Exposed to dangers great,
Therefore the Precepts of thy Word
I never will forget.
Thy Statutes are the Heritage
Whereof I have made choice,
To my last day, for those are they
That make my heart rejoice.
112.96.
I have inclined my heart to keep
The Laws thou did decree,
And by thy Grace will cleave to them
Even till I come to thee.
For, Lord, of all Perfection here
I soon discern an end;
But to all times and states of Life
Thy perfect Laws extend.
Hymn XXXV. Psalm. 119.137, 138, 162, 163.
THY Nature, Lord, and thy Commands
Exactly do agree;
Holy, and just, and true thou art,
And such thy Precepts be.
I have rejoiced at thy Word,
As one that finds a Prize;
And I do love thy Law, O Lord.
But hate the way of Lies.
164, 165, 140.
Sev'n times a day I Will give thee praise,
For thy just Judgments sake,
Great peace have they that love thy ways,
And no offense they take.
Thy Word indeed is very pure,
As Silver tried by Fire,
Therefore thy Servant will be sure
To love it most entire.
17.132.
Deal bounteously in gifts of Grace
With me thy Servant, Lord,
That I may live and run my Race,
And keep thy Holy Word.
Look on me in thy mercy, Lord,
And grant me of the same,
As thou art wont to deal with those
That love and fear thy Name.
133, 171.
Let all my steps by thy just Word
Exactly ordered be,
That no iniquity may have
Dominion over me.
And then my Lips shall be prepared
To offer thankful praise,
When unto me thou have declared
And taught me all thy ways.
Hymn XXXVI. Psalm. 63.1, 2.
To the Tune of Psalm. 67.
O God thou art my God,
I Will seek thee earnestly.
My Soul in me thirsts after thee
Here in the Deserts dry:
That I might see thy power,
And thy most glorious Grace,
As I sometimes have seen it shine
Within thy Holy Place.
3, 4, 8.
That Loving Kindness, Lord,
Which I will ever praise,
Is better far than Life it self,
Though filled with prosp'ring days,
Thus while my Life does last
I will extol thy Fame,
My heart and hands will I lift up
In thy most holy Name.
My Soul is pressing on
To follow after thee,
And still I stand by thy right hand,
For that upholdeth me.
-- 122.1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7.
Therefore will I rejoice
When they to me shall say,
Unto the House of God let us
Together take our way.
For there will we be found,
Where Isr'el's Tribes attend
Upon the lively Oracles
Joynt-praise to Heaven to send.
Pray for Jerus'lem's peace,
And for my Brethren dear;
Peace be in Sion's sacred Walls,
Prosperity be there.
For Lord's Day Noon and Evening.
Hymn XXXVII. Psalm. 33. 1, 2, 3, 4.
YE Righteous in the Lord rejoice,
For praise becomes the Saints;
Praise God with Psaltry, Harp and Voice,
And ten-string'd Instruments.
Sing to the Lord aloud with praise,
With skilful Songs and new,
Because his Word, his Works and Ways
Are holy, just and true.
-- 40.5. -- 22.9. -- 71.17.
Many are those most wondrous works
Which thou (my God) have wrought;
Many thy gracious purposes
Which are to usward thought.
I have been cast upon thy care
Even from my Birth till now,
And from the Womb that brought me forth,
My God and Guide art thou.
Yea from my tender Infancy
I have by thee been taught,
And so have told continually
What wonders thou have wrought.
-- 104.33, 34, 35.
Therefore to God will I sing praise,
While I have life and breath,
And glorify him all my days,
And honor him till death.
My thoughts of him shall be so sweet
As nothing else can be,
And all the streams of Joy shall meet
When, Lord, I think on thee.
Let sinners perish from the Earth,
And wicked be no more:
But thou my Soul, God's praise set forth,
Praise ye the Lord therefore.
Hymn XXXVIII. Psalm. 71.8, 14.
LORD let my mouth be filled with praise,
That I with pleasure may
Thine Honor to the World proclaim,
And publish all the day.
For I with never-fainting hope
Thy mercies will implore,
And celebrate with thankful heart
Thy praises more and more.
15, 16.
Thy righteous Acts and saving Grace
I daily will declare,
Though the one half cannot be told,
So numberless they are.
Depending on thy strength, O Lord,
I will go boldly on;
Thy Righteousness shall be my plea,
Thy Righteousness alone.
19, 20, 21.
Thy Righteousness, O God, exceeds
In the most high degree;
Thou have performed wondrous deeds,
Who can compare with thee?
Thou who have showed me troubles sore,
Shall raise me from the ground,
With boundless Joys and endless Peace
Thou shall enclose me round.
22, 23.
I will instruct each warbling string
To make thy praises known;
Thy Truth and Goodness I will sing,
O Isr'el's Holy One!
A multitude of Joys shall throng
Upon my Lips to sit,
While my glad Soul breaths ont a Song
To him that ransomed it.
Hymn XXXIX. Psalm. 106.1, 2.
O Render thanks unto the Lord,
For kind he is and good;
His mercies still continue sure,
As they have ever stood.
What Language can his mighty deeds
Deservedly proclaim?
What Tongue can sing the immortal praise
Due to his Sacred Name?
105.2, 3.
Therefore let us in thankful Songs
Our great Redeemer bless:
And what his mighty Hand has wrought,
With joyful Tongues express.
O make your boasts with one accord
In God's most Holy Name;
Let every Soul that seeks the Lord
Be joyful in the same.
5, 7, 8.
O let the works that he has done
Your Admiration move;
Think on the Judgments of his Mouth,
And wonders of his Love.
It is our Glory and our Joy
That this great God is ours,
His Judgments pass through all the Earth
With never-failing powers.
His Covenant to his People sealed,
He ever calls to mind,
And will his Promises fulfill
To Ages yet behind.
107.21.
O that all men would praise the Lord
For his great goodness then,
And for his works most wonderful
Unto the Sons of Men.
Hymn XL. Psalm. 113.1, 2, 3.
PRaise ye the Lord, praise ye his Name,
Ye Servants of the Lord;
His Name be now and ever blessed,
Of all with one accord.
Even from the rising of the Sun,
Unto his going down,
Must we proclaim the Lord's High Praise,
And give his Name Renown.
4, 5, 6.
Above all Nations he is advanced;
His Fame surmounts the Sky,
And who is like the Lord our God,
Whose dwelling is on high?
Yet humbles he himself to see
Things done in Heaven above,
And what is done on Earth beneath
Where we poor Mortals move.
-- 111.2, 7, 8.
Great are the works of our great God,
And every one no doubt,
That takes true pleasure in the same,
With care does search them out.
Faithful and just are all his ways,
His Word for ever sure,
When once his Promise is engaged
Performance is secure.
9, 10.
Holy and reverend is his Name,
And to be had in dread;
This true Religious Fear of God
Is Wisdom's Wellspring head.
Good understanding have they all
That carefully endeavor
To practice his Commandments;
His Praise endures for ever.
Hymn XLI. Psalm. 135.1, 2.
SIng Hallelujah, ye that serve
The God by us adored;
O bless the High and Glorious Name
Of our Almighty Lord.
O ye that are admitted thus
Within his House to stand,
And in his Holy Courts attend
The Word of his command.
3, 4.
Praise ye the Lord for he is good;
Sing praises to his Name;
For it is sweet to be employed,
His praises to proclaim.
For God has chosen to himself
Beloved Jacob's Race,
And Israel the chief Treasure is
Of his peculiar Grace.
5, 6.
For well I know the Lord is great,
And that this Lord of ours
Transcends all Gods, and has his Seat
Above all Sovereign Powers.
His Word created all at first,
His Pleasure rules them still:
His Sovereign uncontrolled mind
Heaven, Earth, and Seas fulfill.
19, 20, 21.
O Isr'el's house, bless ye the Lord
With them of Levi's Tribe;
All that devoutly fear the Lord
Due praise to him ascribe.
Let us all now in Sion's Courts
The Lord's High Praise record,
Who dwells at Jerusalem:
Praise ye, praise ye the Lord.
Hymn XLII. Psalm. 136.1, 2, 3.
To the Tune of Psalm. 67.
O Render thanks to God,
For he is very good;
His Mercies sure do still endure,
And have for ever stood.
The God of Gods proclaim,
The Lord of Lords great Name;
His Mercies sure do still endure,
Eternally the same.
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
Who wondrous things has done,
Made Earth and Heaven alone;
His Mercies sure do still endure
To Ages all made known.
Gave Sun and Moon their Light,
To rule both day and night;
His Mercies sure do still endure,
For they are infinite.
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16.
Who Egypt's Firstborn slew,
And thence his Israel drew;
His Mercies sure do still endure,
And ever so shall do.
Led them through parted Seas,
And Deserts, unknown ways;
His Mercies sure do still endure,
Worthy eternal praise.
17, 18, 19, 22, 23, 24.
That famous Kings destroyed,

His Mercies sure do still endure,
And evermore abide.
Our lost Estate he knows,
Redeems us from our Foes;
His Mercies sure do still endure,
A Spring that overflows.
25, 26.
Who still provideth meat
Whereof all flesh may eat;
His Mercies sure do still endure,
For ever full and great.
The God of Heaven therefore
With thankful thoughts adore;
His Mercies sure do still endure
Henceforth for evermore.
Hymn XLIII. Psalm. 146.1, 2, 3, 4.
SIng Hallelujah, O my Soul,
To the Eternal King;
Yea, whilst I any Being have,
His praises I will sing.
Trust not in Kings, though never so great,
Nor in man's mortal Seed,
Whose power is not sufficient
To help you in your need.
Because his breath does soon depart,
Then turns he to his Clay,
And all the Counsels of his heart
Do perish in that day.
5, 6.
Happy is he whose certain Help
From Jacob's God descends;
Thrice happy he whose fixed Hope
On God, his God depends.
Who formed the Earth, and Heavens high frame,
Who made the swelling Deep,
And all that is within the same;
Who Truth does ever keep.
7, 8.
Who with right Judgment still proceeds
For those that be oppressed,
Takes care that hungry Souls be fed,
And Prisoners be released.
The Lord does give the blind their sight,
The bowed down does raise;
In righteous men he takes delight,
And loves them always.
9, 10.
Strangers and Widows he preserves,
The Orphans Cause does own,
But as for sinners prosperous state,
He turns it upside down.
The Lord shall reign eternally;
Thy God, O Sion Hill
Shall reign to all Posterity;
O praise him, praise him still.
Hymn XLIV. Psalm. 147.1, 2, 3.
PRaise ye the Lord, for it is meet
Our God's due praise to sing,
For the employment is most sweet,
And Praise a comely thing.
The Lord builds up Jerusalem,
His outcasts he restores;
With comfort heals the broken hearts,
And binds up their sores.
5, 6, 11.
Unsearchable his Wisdom is,
His Power admits no bound;
He raises up the humble Souls,
Treads sinners to the ground.
The Lord's entire delight and joy
Is ever in the Just,
In them that fear him faithfully,
And in his Mercy trust.
12, 13, 14.
O praise the Lord, Jerusalem,
Thy God, O Sion, praise,
Who makes thy Bars and strength'neth them,
Wherewith thy Gates he stays.
Thy Children in thee he has blessed,
Makes in thy Borders peace;
He fills thee with the very best
Of all the Field's increase.
19, 20.
The sacred Dictates of his Lips
He has to Jacob shown;
His Statutes and his Judgments are
To chosen Israel known.
He has not dealt so favorably
With any Land beside,
Nor have they known his Judgments so,
The Lord be magnified.
Hymn XLV. Psalm. 148.1, 2, 3.
SIng Hallelujah, praise the Lord
Even from the Heavens high,
And from the heights his praise proclaim,
Above the starry Sky.
His Angels all his praise begin,
And all his Hosts of Might;
Praise him both Sun and Moon; praise him,
O all ye Stars of Light.
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
Ye Heaven of Heavens and Waters there,
Praise your Creator's Name,
For by his Great Decree you do
Continue still the same.
Praise God from the Earth, ye Whales and Deeps,
Fire, Hail, and stormy Wind,
Hill, Trees, and Cattle, Worms and Fowl,
Each in your several kind.
11, 12, 13.
Kings of the Earth and People there,
Princes and Judges all,
Young Men, and Maidens every where,
Old Men, and Children small:
O let them praise the Lord's Great Name,
For that excels alone;
His Glory is above the frame
Of Earth, and Heavens high Throne.
-- 149.1, 2, 4, 5.
But above all, let Isr'el's Saints
Of their Redeemer sing,
And let the Sons of Sion Hill
Be joyful in their King.
For God takes pleasure in his Saints,
Will crown the humble Heads,
Therefore let them triumph in him
And sing upon their Beds.
148.14.
For he exalts his Isr'el's Horn,
And all his Saints does raise;
A People near and dear to him,
O give the Lord his praise.
Hymn XLVI. Psalm. 47.6, 7, 9.
SIng praise to God, sing praise with joy,
Sing praises to our King,
For Christ is King of all the World,
All skilful praises sing.
With shouts of Joys He is gone up
To His Imperial Throne;
Our Lord is with the Trumpets sound
To Heaven in Triumph gone.
-- 2.8. -- 22.27.
At his request is given to him
The priv'lege of his Birth,
For His the Heathen Lands shall be,
And utmost Parts on Earth.
The Kindreds of the Nations all
Shall worship in his sight;
For he must govern great and small;
All Nations are his right.
-- 72.2, 4, 6, 7, 11.
With Justice shall he judge the Poor,
Set the Oppressed free.
Like showrs of Rain to parched ground
Shall his Dominion be.
The Just shall flourish in his days,
And all shall be at peace,
Until the very Moon decays,
And all her Motions cease.
Yea all the Kings and higher Powers
Shall kneel before his Throne.
All Nations and their Governors
Shall serve this King alone.
18, 19.
Praise ye the Lord of Hosts, and sing
To Israel's God each one;
For he does every wondrous thing,
Even he himself alone.
And blessed be his glorious Name
All times eternally;
Let the Earth be filled with his fame;
Amen, Amen, say I.
Hymn XLVII. Psalm. 89.1, 19.
THE Eternal Mercies of the Lord
My Song shall still express;
My Mouth to Ages shall record
Thy Truth and Faithfulness.
For thou have laid our Help upon
A Prince of mighty Power;
A chosen one thou have advanced
To be the Savior.
20, 21, 27, 28, 29.
With sacred Oil thou did anoint
David, whom thou had found;
He Is girt with strength for saving-work,
His Head with Glory crowned.
Mercies through him are kept for us,
And Promises are sure;
His Sacred Seed and Sovereign Throne
For ever shall endure.
30, 31, 32, 33, 34.
But if his Seed transgress the Laws
And Statutes of their God,
Then will thou visit their offense
With a correcting Rod.
Yet with not quite withdraw thy Love,
Nor let thy Promise fade;
Thy Covenant thou will never break,
Nor change what thou have said.
35, 52.
Having confirmed it by an Oath,
A Sacred Oath, and High;
Thy Faithful Ones are well assured
Thou will not, caust not lie.
Blessed for ever be the Lord,
And blessed be God again;
And let the Church with one accord
Resound Amen, Amen.
Hymn XLVIII. Psalm. 110.1, 2, 3.
JEhovah to my Lord thus spoke,
Sit thou at my right hand,
Until I make thy baffled Foes
Subject to thy command.
God shall from Sion send that Rod
In which thy strength appears;
Thy People in that day of Power
Shall all be Volunteers.
Moved with the Beauties of thy Church
Young Converts then shall Come,
As numerous as the Pearls of Dew
That drop from Morning's womb.
4, 5, 6, 7.
The Lord a solemn Oath has sworn,
Which he will never break,
Thou art an everlasting Priest,
As was Melchizedek.
And being thus raised to his Throne,
Kings that his Reign oppose
With all the adverse Heathen Powers
Shall perish as his Foes.
Because he shall vouchsafe to taste
The Brook that is in the way;
Thus shall the Lord lift up his head
To triumph and bear sway.
Rev. 5.12, 9, 13.
Therefore to thee, O Lamb of God,
Riches and Power belong,
Wisdom and Honor, Glory, Strength,
And every praising Song.
Thou as our Sacrifice was slain,
And by thy precious Blood,
From every Tongue and Nation have
Redeemed us unto God.
Blessing and Honor, Glory, Power
From all in Earth and Heaven,
To him that sits upon the Throne,
And to the Lamb be given.
Hymns for some particular occasions proper to be sung after Meals.
Hymn XLIX. Psalm. 104.24, 27, 28.
HOW many are thy Works, O Lord,
In Wisdom all composed?
The Earth by thee is richly stored
With Treasures there enclosed.
On thee do all the Creatures wait,
And as Expectants stand,
To have their seasonable food
From thy dispensing hand.
That which thou giv'st as thou see best,
They gather for their food;
Thy liberal hand thou openest,
And they are filled with good.
14, 15.
For Cattle thou make Grass to spring,
And Herbs for Man's own use;
Convenient food for every thing
Thou make the Earth produce.
To glad Man's heart, the fruitful Soil
Brings forth the Grape for Wine,
Heart-strength'ning Bread, and precious Oil,
Which makes his face to shine.
-- 22.26. -- 103.22.
The Meek shall eat and be sufficed,
And those that do endeavor
To know the Lord, shall praise his Name,
Your hearts shall live for ever.
O bless the Lord ye Works of his
Wherewith the World is stored,
Wherever his Dominion is,
My Soul, bless thou the Lord.
Hymn L. [ For the same occasion.] Psalm. 145.1, 2, 9.
THY Sacred Name I will advance,
My King and God of Love;
I Will bless thee now, 'twill be my work
Eternally above.
The Lord is very good to all,
As we do daily find,
For all his works in every place
Taste of his Mercies kind.
10, 15, 16.
Therefore from all thy works thou do
Tributes of praise receive;
But Saints much more with thankful hearts
Their Adorations give.
All Creatures do expect from thee
Supplies of daily food;
Thine open-handed bounty fills
All their desires with good.
-- 111.5. -- 37.19.
Chiefly to them that fear his Name
He gives meat good store,
Because he will be mindful of
His Covenant evermore.
They shall not blush in evil times,
Nor hang their drooping head;
When Famine reigns they shall not want,
But be sufficed with Bread.
-- 145.21.1.
My thankful Mouth shall be employed
God's praises to proclaim;
Let all the World adore his Power,
And ever bless his Name.
Hymn LI. [Proper to be sung at Family-Catechizing.
Psalm. 34.11, 12, 13, 14.2 Cor. 13.11.
COme Children, with a willing heart
Unto my words give ear,
I will instruct you what it is
The Eternal God to fear.
Who is the Man that would live long
And lead a blessed Life,
See thou restrain thy hasty Tongue
From all deceit and strife.
Depart from evil and do good,
Seek peace, and peace pursue;
Be of one mind, and dwell in Love,
And God shall dwell with you.
Psalm. 2.11. -- 119.9.
See that ye do your selves employ
In God's true Service here;
Mix trembling always with your joy,
And worship him in fear.
For how shall Young men cleanse their way,
To walk before the Lord?
Surely by taking heed thereto
According to his Word.
The second Part. Psalm. 90.16. -- 102.28.
Thy great and blessed work, O God,
Unto thy Servants show,
And let their tender Children too
Thy Grace and Glory know.
So shall thy joyful Servants Race
In happy state remain,
And the blessed Issue of their Loins
Thy Favor shall sustain.
-- 22.30, 31.
And thus a Seed shall serve the Lord
Accounted and foreknown,
A Generation of the Lord's
Which he himself does own.
They shall arise with Joy to tell
His Righteousness to those
Who shall be born when we are gone
That God did thus dispose.
89.29.
And so shall David's spiritual Seed
Be made to last always:
And his Established Throne abide
As Heavens Eternal days.
Hymn LII. [ Proper to be sung when a Child is born into the Family.]
Psalm. 128.1, 2, 3.
Blessed is the Man who fears the Lord,
And therefore him obeys,
That keeps his feet within the Paths
Of his prescribed ways.
Thou shall with pleasure eat the sweet
Of what thy pains have got;
Prosperity shall gild thy days,
And crown thy happy Lot.
Thy Wife shall like the spreading Vines
With choicest fruit abound;
Thy Children like green Olive Plants
Adorn thy Table round.
-- 127.3, 4, 5.
For Children are an Heritage
Which from the Lord does come;
And his Reward by Marriage
Is every fruitful Womb.
As Arrows fitted to the Bow
Are in a strong Man's hand;
So Children of the growing youth
Their Parents Glory stand.
That Man enjoys a happy state
Whose Quiver's thus supplied;
He needs not fear when'ere his Cause
Shall in the Gate be tried.
-- 107.41. -- 113.9.
Thus God the Poor does set on high,
And from all harm does keep,
And multiplies his Family
Like to a Flock of Sheep.
The solitary Wife he makes
A Housekeeper well-stor'd,
With Joy to breed her faithful Seed;
Wherefore praise ye the Lord.
Hymn LIII. [ Proper to be sung when Death is in the Family, or in the Family
of any Neighbor or Relation.]
Psalm. 102.11. -- 103.16.
THE days wherein my Life does pass
Are like the Evening shade;
And I am like the withering Grass
Which suddenly does fade:
For it is gone and quickly too,
When some bleak Wind goes over,
And then the place whereon it grew
Shall never know it more.
-- 39.4, 5, 6.
Lord, make me understand my End
And Days uncertain Date,
That I may clearly apprehend
The frailty of my State.
Behold thou have my days reduced
Unto a narrow span;
Mine Age to thine as nothing is,
Vain at the best is Man.
The Worldling walks in a vain show,
Vexes and toils in vain;
He heaps up Wealth, but does not know
To whom it will remain.
The second Part.
7, 8.
And now, O Lord, what wait I for,
What are these Hopes at best?
My Hopes in thee, Lord, only are,
On thee my Soul does rest.
Break thou these Cords of Sin and Guilt,
Wherewith my Soul is tied;
Let me not be the scorn of Fools,
That Piety deride.
9, 11.
When thou my comforts did remove
I spoke not but was dumb,
Because I knew my sufferings, Lord,
From thy good hand did come.
When thou for sin do Man correct,
His Beauties fade and dye
Like Garments fretted by the Moth;
Sure all are vanity.
12, 13.
My mournful state, O Lord, regard,
And to my Cry give Ear;
I am a stranger here on Earth
As all my Fathers were.
O spare me, Lord, and give me space,
My strength and peace restore,
Before I go away from hence,
And shall be seen no more.
Hymn LIVE. [For the like occasion.]
Psalm. 90.1, 2, 3, 4.
LORD thou have been in Changes past
Our Refuge and Abode,
From Age to Age, beyond all Time,
Thou art Eternal God.
When thou recallest Man to dust,
He can no longer stay,
A thousand years are in thy sight
Past off as yesterday.
5, 9.
Swept with a hasty torrent hence
Like a vain dream we pass,
Spring up, and grow, and wither soon
As does the short-lived Grass.
For in thy wrath our sinful days
To a swift Period tend.
Our years, by us unheeded, like
An idle Story end.
10, 12, 14.
Our Age to seventy years is set,
Or if we do arrive
To fourscore years, it is all but grief,
We rather dye than live.
Lord, teach us this Religious Art
Of numbering out our days,
That so we may apply our heart
To sacred Wisdom's ways.
O fill us early with thy Grace,
That so we may rejoice,
And all our days, to the last breath,
Triumph in heart and voice.
Hymn LV. [ Petition for the Church of God, and for the Nation.]
Psalm. 74.12. -- 44.4. -- 7.9.
LORD, thou art Isr'el's King of old,
That have Salvation brought;
Command thou that Deliverance now,
For. Jacob may be wrought.
Let Sinners sin come to an end,
But stablish steadfastly
The righteous men, O righteous God,
That Heart and Reins do try.
-- 85.9. -- 80.3.
Let thy Salvation be at hand
To those that do thee fear,
That Glory may adorn our Land,
And be a Dweller there.
Turn us, O God, to thee again,
For we too long have swerved;
Cause thou thy face on us to shine,
And we shall be preserved.
-- 126.4, 5, 6.
Thy Captived Churches, Lord, restore
As Streams in Southern parts;
For they that sow in tears are sure
To reap with joyful hearts.
He that his precious Seed bears out,
And tears behind him leaves,
Shall come again with joy, no doubt,
And with him bring his sheaves.
-- 14.6.
O that the sweet Salvation then
Which Israel waits for still,
Were fully come to all good men,
From out of Sion Hill.
When God his People's Bondage turns
That Freedom once is had,
Then Jacob shall rejoice that mourns,
And Israel shall be glad.
Hymn LVI. Psalm. 133. [ To be often sung in Families.]
O Happy Families on Earth
Resembling that above,
Where Brethren peacefully unite
In sweet Accord and Love.
It Is like the precious Ointment poured
On Aaron's sacred Head,
Which down his Face and Garments rich
Its fragrant Odors spread.
It Is as the Dew which melting Clouds
On Hermon's top distill,
Or fruitful Showers which Heavens let fall
On Sion's Holy Hill.
For there the God of Love commands
And pours out blessings store,
The Comforts of this present Life,
And Life for evermore.
Four Hymns of Praise to be sung in the Tune of the 100th Psalm.
Hymn LVII. Psalm. 9.1, 7, 8.
WIth my whole heart I Will bless thee, Lord,
And all thy mighty works proclaim,
My Joy in thee shall fill my Soul,
Whilst I sing praises to thy Name.
The Almighty Ever-living God
Has fixed his Throne in Heavenly Light,
When He appears to Judge the World,
His Sentence will be just and right.
10, 11, 14.
All those that know thy faithful Name
Their Hope and Trust in thee will place;
For never did thou, Lord, forsake
Any that duly sought thy Face.
Sing Praises to the Holy One,
Who said he would in Sion dwell;
Therefore in Sian's Daughter's Gates
With Joy his great Salvation tell.
-- 130.7, 8.
Let us depend on God alone,
Because with him rich Mercy is,
And full Redemption from all sin
He gives with plent'ous Grace to his.
Hymn LVIII. Psalm. 45.2, 3, 4.
O Glorious King, thy Form Divine
All Earthly Beauties does outshine;
Into thy Lips all Grace is poured,
On thee Eternal Blessings show'rd.
Gird on thy Sword, and in thy Might
For wronged Truth and Justice fight,
That all the World may understand
The Terror of thy Conquering Hand.
6, 7.
Thy Throne, O God, does still endure
Thy Scepter is most just and pure.
That which is right thou love best,
But wickedness thou do detest.
And therefore God thy God has shed
Such Oil of Gladness on thy Head,
As has preferred thee far before
The Highest Angels evermore.
9, 11, 13, 17.
The Queen and her Attendants stand
To worship thee, at thy right Hand.
Her Clothing of wrought Gold is seen,
But all her Glory is within.
In all succeeding Times thy Name
Shall be preserved with lasting Fame:
Whilst thy glad Followers shall crown
With endless Praise thy High Renown.
Hymn LIX. Psalm. 46. 1, 2.
GOD is our Refuge and Defense,
Our Hope is in his Providence,
Which still affords a present Aid,
When greatest Troubles do invade.
Therefore we shall not need to fear,
No, though the Earth removed were.
Or though the Hills and Mountains steep
Lay buried in the angry Deep.
3, 4, 5.
Although the raging Waters make
The Mountains with their swelling shake,
Yet calmer Rivers do embrace
God's City, his fair Dewlling Place.
Whose Tabernacles by his Love
Are kept that they can never move;
For he, in times of great distress
His early succor will address.
6, 7, 9, 10, 11.
The threatening Tempest he allays,
And is his People's strength and praise.
He makes Strife and Wars to cease,
And crowns the trembling Earth with Peace.
This is our God, whose awful sway
Both Heaven and Earth must still obey.
The Lord of Hosts is with his own,
And Jacob's God their Refuge known.
Hymn LX. Psalm. 93.1, 2.
THE Lord does Reign, and like a King,
Puts on his Robes of Glorious Light:
Tremble thou Earth, when he appears
Clothed and girt with boundless Might.
2.
Under his Rule th'unquiet World
Will gain Establishment and Peace;
Of old his Empire did begin,
And, like himself, shall never cease.
3.
In vain the World's Rebellious Powers
In tumults and commotions rise,
Like the enraged Floods that swell
And bid defiance to the Skies.
4.
The Lord on high is mightier far
Than all this loud and threatening Noise;
And the proud Sea's unruly Waves
Are stilled by his commanding Voice.
5.
Lord, as thy Power can never fail,
So all thy Promises are sure.
It Is thy Perfection to be true,
And theirs that serve thee to be pure.
