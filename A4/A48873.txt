A Commonplace Book TO THE HOLY BIBLE: OR, THE Scriptures Sufficiency
Practically Demonstrated. WHEREIN

Manners, is reduced to its Proper Head: Weighty Cases Resolved, Truths

2 Timothy III. 16. All Scripture is given by the Inspiration of God, and is
profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Instruction in
Righteousness. LONDON, Printed by Edw. Jones, for Awnsham and John Churchil, at
the Black Swan in Paternoster Row, 1697.

TO THE READER.
THAT the Holy Scriptures are one of the greatest Blessings which God bestows
upon the Sons of Men, is generally acknowledged by all who know any thing of
the value and worth of them. To show their Use and Excellency, is beyond the
Author's present design or intendment; it is already done by one or other to
good purpose every day. In them the Lord has dilucidly displayed that Counsel
of his Will, that is of infinite concernment to us to understand, in order to
our present being accepted of him here, and at last brought to the fullest
enjoyment of himself in Glory. It Is wonderful to behold, how full and perfect
this Word is, with respect to this end; What can Man desire to know, which is
necessary hereunto, that the light thereof discovers not? What direction can he
expect, by which he may be fortified against all Enemies of his good, either
within or without him, that is not there given? What Encouragements would he
have which are not therein displayed before him? And what Cavils can be brought
against any part of Truth contained therein, to which they themselves yield not
a full resolve? (one place of Scripture so exactly clearing, expounding, and
illustrating another) Yet (to amazement) it is observed, That Man (who is so
highly and principally concerned in it) does too too little value it; he can
weary himself in any secular Affair, but diligently to search the Scriptures
(according to our Lord's advice) is to him tedious and burthensom. Few covet to
be mighty in the Scriptures; though convinced, their great concern is inveloped
in them: A Spirit of Self-fulness, Pride, spiritual Sloth, Drowsiness, and
Deadness, lies at the bottom of this sinful Neglect. To encourage, awaken
Persons to a more diligent through search of the mind of God herein, is a
service no less profitable than seasonable at this day. And what greater
external Encouragement, than to make that facile and easy, which seemed
inconquerably arduous and difficult?

This is the design of the ensuing Treatise: Nor is the Author altogether
without hopes (wherein he has the concurring Judgment of several eminently
Learned and Judicious Divines, who have perused it) but, by the Blessing of
God, it may have a singular tendency to the enlightening of some, and
establishing of others in Divine Truths (when uno intuitu they see the
Scriptures, upon which they are built) and enabling them with ease to confute
Gainsayers. For here the several Texts of Holy Scripture (which lie scattered
in the Book of God) are Collected together, Transcribed and placed (in the
Order as they lie in the Bible) under several and particular Heads. And where
any Subject is fallen on, and mentioned in the General Head (and sometimes also
in a particular Head) there (for the most part) is to be found all that relate
to that Matter, immediately following under particular Heads, or Sub-Divisions,
to the end that the whole thereof may be met with together: Or, at least, there
are references to some others General or Particular Head, where it is placed
more properly.

And here Note, Christian Reader, That thou have not only the Places positive
to the Subject there, but also such which are any ways argumentative, or
enforcing (whether by Examples, the Equity of the Things, the Nature of God,
his approbation of Promises to, or threatenings against it) or any way
illustrating or Expounding of it, by whatsoever terms they are expressed:
Whereof a little use of this Treatise will soon give thee a full evidence.

But, to prevent Prejudice and Mistakes, and give thee some light in the way
and method the Author has taken, He proposes to thy Observation these few
things following.

First. To prevent prejudice, do the Author and thy self this right, Not to
make a judgment by the reading of one or two Texts at the beginning of any
Head: For possibly they may not at the first blush seem to thee so pertinent to
the matter, as others do which follow; they may be only argumentative, and not
positive: For the Author so placed them on purpose, that they might run in
order, as they lie in the Bible, that the Reader might go to any Text of either
Testament, without turning backward and forward, and for other Advantages; and
thence it happens sometimes, That the Scriptures less to the purpose, first
occur to thy View.

Likewise, pass not Sentence upon any Text thou shall find under any Head, as
impertinent to the Subject there, until thou have seriously weighed the same:
For possibly in so doing thou may discern something in that Scripture, which
thou never did observe before, nor might have taken notice of, had not the
Head or Subject there turned thy thoughts upon it.

And then, the Author doubts not, but that the Composure it self (when
judiciously considered) will prevent this Censure, That it is a needless Work,
as having been done already by others: This being a thing of another Nature
than any yet extant, and will be helpful at another rate. For (notwithstanding
any other helps) the finding out of apt Scriptures for illustrating,
confirming, and making use of any Truth which may be upon the thoughts of any,
have been, as it is, a difficult and laborious Work; and thence Men ofttimes
use Scriptures, either not apt, according to the intent of the Holy Ghost
there; or such, the genuine sense of which is doubted. And for the use of
Concordances herein, each Man's memory must record the Scriptures: for they
must first occur to his thoughts, then his Judgment must fix upon some word
therein, under which the Text is placed; and it is possible not hit the right
term under which it is; and oft-times look a long time ere he come to it,
because of the multitude of words there used: and happily miss at last too, and
be put upon searching under another term. But here thou may only turn to the
Subject thou inquire after, and (without any such steps) find Scriptures full
and apt thereto (by whatsoever Terms or Phrases they are expressed) occur to
your eye at an instant; and almost (if not altogether) all the Scripture
affords to that Subject; and present thee with matter of Enlargement, which
possibly thou thoughtest not of.

Secondly, To give thee some light in the Method, and to help thee in the use
of this.

1 st, Take notice, that in Chap. 13. [Of Saints failings,] The first Texts are
to prove each Person his Saintship; then the next following, their Failings:
and this is done on purpose, that it might appear they are the Failings of
Saints: and so proper to the Head.

2 dly, Note also, That the words within a Parenthesis beginning with [or] are
the Marginal Readings.

3 dly, Some General Heads have no Particulars following, but the whole placed
under that General Head. This is so done, either because the Texts which the
Scripture affords to that Subject, are but few in the whole, and so easily run
through; or that the Matters are so various, that almost every Verse carries a
distinct thing in it, yet still relating to the General Head; as that [ Of the
Saints Privileges] each Text almost a distinct Privilege: So that [ Of the
Character of Saints] and some other of like Nature. And here to have descended
to Particular Heads, would have been tedious and unnecessary; for the words
being there transcribed, the Reader may presently inform himself in the whole,
and in every particular.

Lastly, A little pains in observing the Contents or Table in the Front of the
Book, which does contain the General and Particular Heads therein, and also the
References thereto, and directs to Chapter and Page where each lies, will
enable thee to discern more of the Method and usefulness of the Work, than can
be well expressed in a short Epistle.

Therefore this shall suffice, supposing the Work it self will show its own
Usefulness and Advantage to the Meditation about Divine Matters; holding a Man
to one Subject, and yielding variety of Matter to enforce upon the mind, and
leave impression there: When bare reading a Chapter or two (as some use to do
as a task) proves not effectual for that end; and searching proves laborious;
and to many (by reason of the difficulty of finding) discouraging also.

In this Edition the Errata of the former Edition are Corrected; and the Work
is enlarged about a fourth Part.

CHAP. VI.
The Case the Law concludes Men under.
I. Under Sin and Guilt.
IF thou, Lord, should mark iniquities: O Lord, who shall stand? Psalm 130.
3. Job. 9. 1, 2.

Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one who accuses
you, even Moses, in whom ye trust, John 5. 45.

We have before proved ( or, charged) both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all
under sin; as it is written, There is none righteous, etc. Whatsoever the law
says, it says unto them who are under law: that every mouth may be stopped,
and all the world may become guilty ( or, subject to the Judgment of God)
before God, etc. There is no difference, for all have sinned, and come short of
the glory of God, Romans 3. 9, 19, 23.

Where no law is, is no transgression, Romans 4. 15.

Until the law, sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed, when there is no
law, etc. The law entered, that the offense might abound, etc. Romans 5. 13, 20.

I had not known sin, but by the law, etc. Without the law, sin was dead. I was
alive without the law once, but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I
died, etc. That sin might appear sin, etc. and by the commandment might become
exceeding sinful, Romans 7. 7, 8, 9, 13.

For God has concluded them all ( or, shut them up together) in unbelief, etc.
Romans 11. 32.

The strength of sin is the law, 1 Cor. 15. 56.

The scripture has concluded all men under sin, Gal. 3. 22. Romans 5. 12. Psalm
143. 2.

Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one, is made guilty of all,
etc. James 2. 10.

II. Under the Curse thereof.
CUrsed be he, who confirms not all the words of this law to do them; and,
etc. Deuteronomy. 27. 26.

If thou will not, etc. to do all his commandments and his statutes, which I
command thee, etc. all these curses shall come upon thee. Cursed thou, etc.
Deuteronomy. 28. 15, 16, 17, 18, etc.

Thus says the Lord God of Israel, Cursed the man who obeys not, etc. Jer.
11. 3, 4.

For as many as are of the works of the law, are under the curse; for it is
written, Cursed is every one who continues not in all things which are written
in the book of the law to do them, Gal. 3. 10.

III. The Deeds of the Law, or Sacrifices under it, cannot justify, or purge
from Sin, but still leave Sinners under Guilt, Condemnation, and Wrath.
HOW should man be just with God ( or before God?) if he will contend with him,
he cannot answer one of a thousand, Job 9. 2, 3.

Sacrifices and offerings thou did not desire, Psalm 40. 6, 7.

Enter not into judgment, etc. for in thy sight shall no flesh living be
justified, Psalm 143. 2.

Ye who kindle a fire, and encompass your selves, etc. walk in the light of
your fire, etc. ye shall lie down in sorrow, Isa. 50. 11.

When ye have done all that is commanded you, say, We are unprofitable
servants, etc. Luke 17. 10.

The parable to such who trusted in themselves, that they were righteous, etc.
Two men went into the temple, etc. the Publican went away justified, rather
than the Pharisee, who had much to boast of his doings. I have observed all
these things from my youth: Christ said, There is one thing, etc. Luke 18. 9,
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 20, 21, 22, 23. M^tth. 3. 9.

There is one, who accuses you, even Moses, in whom ye trust, John 5. 45.

By him, all who believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not
be justified by the law of Moses, Acts 13. 39.

By the deeds of the law, there shall no flesh be justified in his sight, Romans
3. 20.

For if they who are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise
is made of none effect. Because the law works wrath, Romans 4. 14, 15.

For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died, etc. Romans 5.
6, 10.

What the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, etc. Romans 8.
3.

Israel who followed after the law of righteousness, has not attained to the
law of righteousness. Wherefore? because not by faith, but, as it were, by the
works of the law: for they stumbled at that stumbling stone, Romans 9. 31, 32.

Christ is the end of the law, for righteousness to every one who believe, Romans
10. 3, 4.

I know nothing of my self; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judges
me is the Lord, 1 Cor. 4. 4.

The strength of sin is the law, 1 Cor. 15. 56.

A man is not justified by the works of the law, etc. For by the works of the
law shall no flesh be justified, etc. If righteousness come by the law, then
Christ is dead in vain, Gal. 2. 16, 21.

That no man is justified by the law, in the sight of God it is evident: for
the just shall live by faith, and the law is not of faith; but the man who does
them, shall live in them, etc. Wherefore then serves the law? it was added
because of trangression, till the seed should come, etc. If there had been a
law given, which could have given life, verily, righteousness should have been
by the law, etc. Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster unto Christ, Gal. 3.

By grace ye are saved, etc. not of works, lest any man should boast, Ephesians. 2.
8, 9.

We are the Circumcision who worship God in the spirit, etc. and have no
confidence in the flesh, etc. Paul was very zealous of the law, and if any man
had whereof to boast in that respect, he more; yet he accounted all but loss

righteousness, which is of the law, Phil. 3. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

In which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, which could not make him who
did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience, Heb. 9. 9.

For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of
the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year
continually, make the comers thereunto perfect: For then would they not have
ceased to be offered, because that the worshippers once purged, should have had
no more conscience of sins; but in those sacrifices a remembrance of sin again
every year; for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats should
take away sins, etc. Sacrifice and offerings thou would not, etc. In burned

We are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy
rags, Isa. 64. 6.

When ye have done all these things which are commanded you, say, We are
unprofitable servants; we have done that which was our duty to do, Luke 17. 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

If the ministration of death written and engraven in stones was glorious, so
that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses, for
the glory of his countenance, which was to be done away, etc. How shall not the
ministration of the Spirit be rather glorious? For if the ministration of
condemnation be glory, much more does the ministration of righteousness exceed
in glory; for even that which was made glorious, had no glory in this respect,
by reason of the glory which excels: for if that which is done away was
glorious, much more that which remains is glorious, 2 Cor. 3. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

This only would I know of you; Received ye the Spirit by the work of the law,
or by the hearing of faith? Are ye so foolish? having begun in the spirit, are
ye now made perfect by the flesh? etc. Gal. 3. 2, 3, 5.

door, I will come in to him, and sup with him, and he with me, Rev. 3. 20.

CHAP. VIII.
How Christ wrought this Salvation for Sinners, and what he was made, and is;
what he undertook, and did, in order to it.
1. He is Mediator.
THere is one God, one Mediator between God and man, the man Jesus Christ, 1 Timothy 2. 5.

By so much was Jesus made a Surety of a better testament, Heb. 7. 22.

He is made the Mediator of a better testament, which was established upon
better promises, Heb. 8. 6.

And for this cause he is the Mediator of the New Testament, that, etc. Heb. 9.
15.

And to Jesus, the Mediator of the new covenant, ( or testament) Heb. 12. 24.

II. He took upon him the Nature of Man, a Body of Flesh, and humbled himself.
GOD said to the serpent, etc. I will put enmity between thee and the woman,
and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shall
bruise his heel, Genesis 3. 15.

Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a Son, and shall call his name
Immanuel, Isa. 7. 14.

grow out of his roots; and the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, etc.
Isa. 11. 1, 2. Acts 13. 22, 23.

His visage was so marred, more than any man; and his form more than the sons
of men, Isa. 52. 14.

He has no form nor comeliness: and when we shall see him, there is no beauty
that we should desire him; he is despised and rejected of men, a man of
sorrows, etc. We hid, as it were, our faces from him; he was despised, and we
esteemed him not, Isa. 53. 2, 3.

The Lord has created a new thing in the earth: a woman shall compass a man,
Jer. 31. 22.

They shall smite the Judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek, Micah 5. 1.

The birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise, etc. Mary was sound with child of
the Holy Ghost, etc. She had brought forth her firstborn Son, and he called
his name Jesus, Matthew. 1. 18, 20, 23, 25.

Thou shall conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shall call his
name Jesus: the holy thing which shall be born of thee, shall be called the Son
of God, Luke 1. 31, 35.

He was tempted of the devil, Matthew. 4. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

And Jesus said unto them, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have
nests: but the Son of man has not where to lay his head, Matthew. 8. 20.

Is not this the Carpenter's Son? Is not his mother called Mary? and his
brethren, James? etc. And they were offended in him, Matthew. 13. 55, 56, 57.

He rode upon an Ass into the city of Jerusalem, Matthew. 21. 2, 4, 7.

She brought forth her firstborn Son, and wrapped him in swadling-clothes, and
laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn, etc. He
went down with them, etc. and was subject to them: But his mother kept, etc.
Luke 2. 7, 51.

And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among (...) John 1. 14.

Jesus therefore being weary with his journey, sat thus on the well, John 4. 6.

The bread which I give is my flesh, which I give for the life of the world,
John 6. 51.

The high priest prophesied, that Jesus should die, etc. and gather the
dispersed sons of God into one, John 11. 49, 50, etc.

David, etc. knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit
of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ, etc. Acts 2.
29, 30.

Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, who was made of the seed of David,
according to the flesh, Romans 2. 3. 2 Timothy 2. 8. Re^. 22. 16.

God sending his Son, in the likeness of sinful flesh, Romans 8. 3.

Of whom, as concerning the flesh, Christ came, Romans 9. 5.

Ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ; that though he was rich, yet for
your sakes he became poor, etc. 2 Cor. 8, ^.

Though he was cru^ified through weakness, yet he lived, 2 Cor. 13. 4.

God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, Gal. 4. 4.

But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant,
and was made in the likeness of men; and being found in fashion as a man, he
humbled himself, and became obedient, etc. Phil. 2. 7, 8.

Has he reconciled in the body of his flesh, through death, etc. Col. 1. 21,
22.

Great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifested in the flesh, 1 Timothy 3.
16.

Jesus, who was made a little lower than the Angels, for the suffering of
death, etc. He who sanctifies, and they who are sanctified, are all one: for
which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren, etc. As the children are
partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same,
that through death, etc. Verily, he took not on him the nature of Angels, but
he took on him the seed of Abraham; wherefore in all things it behoved him to
be made like unto his brethren, Heb. 2. 9, 11, 14, 16, 17.

Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers, etc. though he
were a Son, yet learned he obedience, etc. Heb. 5. 7, 8.

Sacrifice, etc. thou would not; but a body have thou prepared me, etc. A
new and living way, which he has consecrated ( or made) for us, through the
vail, that is to say, his flesh, Heb. 10. 5, 20. Psalm. 40. 6, 7.

Every spirit who confesses that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is of God:
and every spirit which confesses not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh,
is not of God, 1 John 4. 2, 3.

Many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is
come in the flesh, 2 John, Verse. 7.

III. He is made an High Priest.
AND I will raise me up a faithful Priest, who shall do according to that which
is in mine heart, and in my mind; and I will build him a sure house, and he
shall walk before mine Anointed for ever, 1 Samuel 2. 35.

The Lord has sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a Priest for ever, after
the order of Melchizedeck, Psalm. 110. 4. Heb. 5. 5, 6.

Thus says the Lord, David shall never want a man, etc. Neither shall the
Priests, the Levites, want a man before me, to offer, etc. Jer. 33. 17, 18.

The Man whose name is the Branch, etc. he shall be a Priest upon his throne;
and, etc. Zech. 6. 13.

It behooves him in all things to be made like his brethren, that he might be a
merciful and faithful High Priest in things pertaining to God, to make
reconciliation for sins: for in that he himself has sufferred, being tempted,
he is able to succor them who are tempted, Heb. 2. 17, 18. Luke 4, 1, 2, 3,
etc.

Consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus, who was
faithful to him who appointed him, as also Moses was, etc. Heb. 3. 1, 2.

Seeing then that we have a great high priest, who is passed into the heavens,
Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast, etc. For we have not an high priest,
which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities: but was in all
points tempted like as we are, yet without sin, Hebr. 4. 14, 15. chapter 5. 2.

For every high priest taken from among men, is ordained for men in things
pertaining unto God, that he may offer, etc. Who can have compassion on ( or,
can reasonably bear with) the ignorant, and them who are out of the way, etc.
And no man takes this honor to himself, but he who is called of God, as
Aaron. So also Christ glorified not himself, to be made an high priest: but he
who said unto him, Thou art my Son, etc. Thou a Priest, etc. Hebr. 5. 1, 2, 3,
4, 5.

Hope, which we have as an anchor of the soul, sure and steadfast, and which
enters within the vail; whither the forerunner is for us entered; Jesus made
an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedeck, Hebr. 6. 19, 20.

For this Melchisedeck king of Salem, Priest of the most high God, etc. having
neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God,
abides a Priest continually, etc. After the similitude of Melchisedeck, there
arises another Priest, who is made not after the law of a carnal commandment,
but after the power of an endless life: for he testifies thou art a Priest for
ever after the order of Melchisedeck, etc. Not without an oath, for those were
made without an oath, but this with an oath, by him who said unto him, The Lord
swear, and will not repent, Thou art a Priest, etc. And they truly were many
Priests, because they were not suffered to continue, by reason of death: but
this man, because he continues for ever, has an unchangeable Priesthood ( or,
which passes not from one another,) wherefore he is able to save them to the
uttermost ( or, for evermore) who come unto God by him, seeing he ever lives
to make intercession for them. For such an high Priest became us, who was holy,
etc. who needs not daily as those high Priests offer, etc. for this he did
once, whence he offered up himself. For the law makes men high Priests who
have infirmities, but the word of the oath, which was since the law, makes the
Son who is consecrated ( or, perfected) for evermore, Hebr. 7. 1, 3, 15, 16,
17, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28.

But Christ being come an high Priest of good things to come, by a greater and
more perfect tabernacle, etc. Hebr. 9. 11.

Now of the things which we have spoken, this is the sum. We have such an
high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the
heavens. A minister of the sanctuary ( or, holy Things) which the Lord pitched,
and not man; for every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices,
wherefore it is of necessity that this man should have somewhat also to offer,
Hebr. 8. 1, 2, 3.

IV. He offered himself as a Sacrifice to God, suffered for the Sins of
Mankind, and so made Peace through the shedding of his own Blood, by which he
entered into the Holiest for us.
I, A w^rm, and no man, a reproach of men, and ^esp^^^ of the people. All they
who see me, laugh me to scorn, etc. and shake the head, saying, He trusted in
the Lord, that he would deliver him: Let him deliver him, seeing he trusted in
him, etc. The assembly of the wicked have enclosed me; they pierced my hands
and feet, etc. they part my garment amongst them, and cast lots for my vesture,
Psalm. 22. 6, 7, 8, 16, 18. Matthew. 27. 39, 40, 41, 42, 43. Psalm 109. 25.

False witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breath out cruelty, Psalm.
27. 12. Mat. 26. 60, 61.

For thy sake I have born reproach, shame has covered my face: I am become a
stranger to my brethren, an alien unto my mother's children: for the zeal of
thine house has eaten me up; and the reproaches of them who reproach thee, are
fallen upon me, etc. Reproach has broken my heart, and I am full of heaviness,
etc. They gave me also gall for my meat, and in my thirst they gave me vinegar
to drink, Psalm 69. 7, 8, 9, 20, 21. Matthew. 27. 34.

Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the Son of man, etc.
Psalm 80. 17.

I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks (...) to them who plucked off the
hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting, Isa. 50. 6. Matthew. 26. 67, 68.
Job 16. 10.

He is despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows, and acquainted with
grief, etc. Surely he has born our grief, and carried our sorrows: yet we did
esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted: he was wounded for our
transgressions; he was bruised for our iniquities, the chastisement of our
peace was upon him, and with his stripes ( or, bruises) we are healed, etc. We
have turned every one to his own way, and the Lord has laid the iniquity of us
all upon him, ( or, he has made the Iniquity of us all to meet upon him.) He
was oppressed, he was afflicted, etc. he was taken from prison, and from
judgment, etc. he was cut off out of the land of the living; for the
transgression of my people was he stricken ( or, was the stroke upon him.) He
made his grave with the wicked, etc. It pleased the Lord to bruise him; he has
put him to grief, when thou shall make his soul an offering ( or, when his Soul
shall make an offering) for sin, etc. he shall bear their iniquities, etc. he
has poured out his soul unto death; and he was numbered with the transgressors;
and he bare the sins of many, and made intercession for the transgressors, Isa.
53. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. Psalm. 116. 3. Luke 22 37. Matthew. 27. 38.

Who is this who comes from Edom, with dyed garments from Bosrah? etc.
Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel? etc. I have trodden the Wine Press
alone, and of the people there was none with me, Isa. 63. 1, 2, 3. Genesis 49. 11.

Shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself, etc. and he shall confirm the
covenant with many, etc. He shall cause the sacrifice and oblation to cease,
Dan. 9. 26, 27.

By the blood of thy covenant ( or, whose Covenant is by Blood) I have sent
forth thy prisoners, Zech. 9. 11.

What are these wounds in thine hands? then shall he answer, Those with which I
was wounded in the house of my friends. Awake, O Sword, against my shepherd,
and against the man, my fellow, says the Lord of Hosts: smite the shepherd,
etc. Zechar. 13. 6, 7, Matthew. 26. 31, 47, 48, 49.

From that time forth began Jesus to show, etc. how that he must suffer many
things of the Elders, etc. and be killed, etc. When Peter had said, Be it far
from thee, Lord, he turned, and said to Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan, etc.
thou savourest not the things of God, etc. Matthew. 16. 21, 22, 23. Luke 17. 25.

Likewise also shall the Son of man suffer of them, etc. the Son of man shall
be betrayed into the hands of men, and they shall kill him, Matthew. 17. 12, 22,
23. Acts 3. 13, 15.

The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of the chief priests, etc. and
they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock,
and to scourge, and to crucify him, Matthew. 20. 17, 18, 19. Luke 18. 31, 32,
33. and Acts 10. 39.

The chief priests, etc. assembled and consulted that they might take Jesus by
subtilty and kill him, etc. Jesus, etc. began to be sorrowful and very heavy;
then said he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death etc. Put
up thy sword; think thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall
presently give me more than twelve legions of Angels: But how then shall the
Scripture be fulfilled, that thus it must be? They spit in his face, and
buffeted him, Matthew. 26. 2. 37, 38, 52, 53, 54, 67. John 12. 27. Mark 14. 33,
34.

The soldiers mocked him, they spit upon him, and smote him on the head, etc.
they gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall, etc. they crucified him
between two thieves, etc. they parted his garments, etc. He cried with a loud
voice, saying, My God, my God, Why have thou forsaken me? etc. Jesus, when he
had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the Ghost, Matthew. 27. 27, 28, 29,
30, 34, 35, 46, 50. John 19. 23, 24, etc. Psalm. 69. 21.

Thus it is written, and thus it behooves Christ to suffer, Luke 24. 46.

My flesh, which I will give for the life of the world, John 6. 51.

friends, John 15. 13.

one body, by the cross; having slain the enmity thereby, ( or in himself) and
came and preached peace to you who were far off, and to them who are near, etc.
Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with
the saints, and of the household of God, Ephesians. 2. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 18, 19.

And having made ( or making) peace through the blood of his cross, by him to
reconcile all things to himself; by him, whether they be things, etc. And you
who were sometimes alienated, and enemies in your minds by wicked works, yet
now has he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death, to present you
holy and unblameable, etc. Col. 1. 20, 21, 22.

It behooves him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful
and faithful High Priest, etc. to make reconciliation for the sins of the
people, Heb. 2. 17.

Who his own self bare our sins, etc. by whose stripes ye were healed: for ye
were as sheep going altray, but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop
of our souls, 1 Pet. 2. 24, 25.

For Christ also has once suffered for sins, the (...) for the unjust, that he
might bring us to God, 1 Pet. 3. 18.

III. Justification and Sanctification before God.
LET not them who wait on thee, O Lord God of hosts, be ashamed for my sake:
Let not those who seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel. Because
for thy sake I have born reproach, shame has covered my face: I am become a
stranger unto my brethren, etc. for the zeal of shine house, etc. and the
reproaches of them who reproached thee, have fallen upon me, etc. Psalm. 69. 6,
7, 8, 9, 10, etc.

Surely shall one say, In the Lord have I righteousness and strength, etc. in
the Lord shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory, Isa 45.
24, 25.

By his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear
their iniquities, Isa. 53. 11.

I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean from all your
filthiness; and from all your idols will I cleanse you, etc. I will also save
you from all your uncleanness, etc. Not for your sakes do I this, says the
Lord God, be it known unto you: Be ashamed and confounded for your own ways, O
house of Israel. Thus says the Lord God, In the day that I shall have cleansed
you from all your iniquities, etc. Ezekiel. 36. 22, 25, 29, 32, 33.

The Lord whom ye seek, shall suddenly come, etc. for he is like a refiner's
fire, etc. He shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and
silver, etc. Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto
the Lord, Mal. 3. 1, 2, 3, 4.

The Pharisee prayed thus; God, I thank thee that I am not as other men are;
extortioners, etc. I fast twice a week, etc. And the Publican standing afar
off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, etc. saying, God be
merciful unto me a sinner. I tell you, This man went down unto his house
justified, rather than the other, Luke 18. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

For their sakes I sanctify my self, that they also might be sanctified, etc.
John 17. 19.

And by him all who believe are justified from all things, from which ye could
not be justified by the law of Moses, Acts 13. 39.

Therein is the righteousness of God revealed, from faith to faith; as it is
written, The just shall live by faith, Romans 1. 17.

The righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the
law and the prophets; even the righteousness of God, which is by faith of Jesus
Christ, unto all, and upon all them who believe, etc. Being justified freely by
his grace, through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ, whom God has set
forth, etc. to declare his righteousness, etc. to declare, I say, his
righteousness; that he might be just, and the justifier of them who believe in
Jesus. Where is boasting then? etc. Wherefore we conclude, that a man is
justified by faith, without the deeds of the law, Romans 3. 2^, 22, 24, 25, 26,
27, 28.

Abraham believed God; and it was counted unto him for righteousness. Now to
him who works, is the reward; not reckoned of grace, but of debt. But to him
who works not, but believes on him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is
counted unto him for righteousness; even as David describes the blessedness of
the man unto whom God imputes righteousness without works, etc. He received
the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith, etc. that
he might be the father of them who believe, though they be not circumcised,
that righteousness might be imputed unto them also, etc. for the promise, etc.
not to Abraham, or to his feed, through the law; but through the righteousness
of faith, etc. It was imputed to him for righteousness: Now it was not written
for his sake alone, that it was imputed unto him; but for us also, to whom it
shall be imputed, if we believe on him who raised up Jesus, etc. who was
delivered for our offenses, and was raised again for our justification, Romans 4.
3, 4, 5, 6, 11, 13, 22, 23, 24, 25. Genesis 15. 6.

Being justified by faith, etc. much more then being now justified by his
blood, we shall be saved, etc. The free gift of many offenses unto
justification, etc. As by one offense, judgment came upon all to condemnation;
even so by the righteousness of one, ( or by one righteousuess) the free gift
came upon all men to justification of life, etc. By the obedience of one, shall
many be made righteous, Romans 5. 1, 9, 16, 17, 18, 19.

There is therefore now no condemnation to them who are in Christ Jesus, etc.
Whom he did foreknow, them he also justified, etc. Who shall lay any thing to
the charge of God's elect? It is God who justifies: Who is he who condemns?
It is Christ who died; yea rather, that is risen again, etc. Romans 8. 1, 29, 30,
33, 34.

The Gentiles, who followed not after righteousness, have attained unto
righteousness, etc. which is of faith. But Israel, who followed after the law
of righteousness, has not attained unto the law of righteousness. Wherefore?
Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law,
Romans 9. 30, 31, 32.

They being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their
own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God:
for Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one who believes,
etc. The righteouness which is of faith says on this wise, etc. For with the
heart man believes unto righteousness, Romans 10. 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. chapter 8.
3, 4.

Christ Jesus, who of God, is made unto us wisdom* and righteousness, and
sanctification, etc. 1 Cor. 1. 30.

But ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of
the Lord Jesus, 1 Cor. 6. 11.

God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not imputing their
trespasses to them. He (...) made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin, (...)
we might be made the righteousness of God in him, 2 Cor. 5. 19, 21.

A man is not justified by the works of the law, but ^y the faith of Jesus
Christ. Even we believe, etc. that we may be justified by the faith of Christ,
and ^ot etc. Gal. 2. 16.

Paul, to the Galatians, does argue this at large, (...)

(...) through the spirit, wait for the hope of righteousness by faith, etc.
Gal. 5. 5.

H^^ g^^ce, wherein he has made us accepted in the ^elo^^d, Ephesians. 1. 6.

Christ gave himself, etc. that he might sanctify and cleanse it, etc. that he
might present it to himself a glorious Church, not having spot or wrinkle, or
any such thing; but that it should be holy, and without blemish, Ephesians. 5. 25,
26, 27.

When Paul, above any others, had whereof to boast, for his Exactness in
keeping the Law, he said, But what things were gain to me, them ( or those) I
counted loss for Christ, etc. that I may win Christ, and be found in him; not
having mine own righteousness, which is of the law; but that which is through
Faith in Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith. Philip. 3. 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9.

And you, etc. has he reconciled in the body of his flesh, through death; to
present you holy, and unblameable, and unreprovable in his sight. Colos. 1. 21,
22.

And ye are complete in him, who is the head of all principalities, etc. Colos.
2. 10.

Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all
iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, Tit. 2. 14.

After that the loving kindness of God appeared, etc. not by the works of
righteousness which we have done, etc. that being justified by his grace, we
should be made heirs, etc. Tit. 3. 4, 5, 7.

Who, etc. when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down, etc. Heb. 1. 3.

If the blood of bulls, etc, sanctified to the purifying of the flesh: how much
more shall the blood of Christ? who, etc. purge your consciences from dead
works, etc. Heb. 9. 13, 14.

By the which will we are sanctified, through the offering of the body of Jesus
Christ once for all, etc. By one offering he has for ever perfected them who
are sanctified, etc. Heb. 10. 10, 14, 29.

Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood,
suffered without the gate, etc. Heb. 13. 12.

Who his own self bare our sins, etc. by whose stripes we were healed, 1 Pet.
2. 24. Isa. 53. 5.

Jesus, etc. who has loved us, and washed us with his own blood, etc. Rev. 1.
5.

These were redeemed ( or bought) from among men, etc. they were without fault
before the throne of God, Rev. 14. 4, 5.

IV. Eternal Life and Salvation.
THE just shall live by his faith, Hab. 2. 4. Fear not, little flock; for it is
your Father's good pleasure to give you the Kingdom, Luke 12. 32.

Christ said unto Zacheus, This day is salvation come to this house, etc. for
the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost, Luke 19. 9, 10.

So must the Son of man be lifted up, that whosoever believes in him, should
not perish, but have ^^ernal life. For God so loved the world, that he gave his
only begotten Son, that whosoever believed in him, should not perish, but have
everlasting life, etc. He who believes on the Son, has everlasting life, etc.
John 3. 14, 15, 16, 17, 36.

Ye will not come unto me, that ye may have life, John 5. 40.

The bread of God is he who comes down from heaven, and gives life unto the
world, etc. I am the bread of life, etc. This is the will of him who sent me,
That every one who sees the Son, and believes on him, may have everlasting
life; and I will raise him up at the last day, etc. This is the bread which
came down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die. I am the living
bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live
for ever: and the bread that I will give, is my flesh, which I will give for
the life of the world, etc. Whosoever eats my flesh, etc. has eternal life, etc.
As, etc. I live by the Father, so he who eats me, even he shall live by me,
etc. Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou have the words of eternal life, John 6.
33, 35, 40, 50, 51, 54, 57, 58, 68. chapter 5. 24.

I am the door; by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, etc. I am come,
that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly. My
sheep hear my voice, etc. and I give unto them eternal life, and they shall
never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand, John 10. 9. 10,
27, 28.

Because I live, ye shall live also, John 14. 19.

As thou have given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life
to as many as thou have given him, John 17. 2.

These things are written, that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the
Son of God; and that believing, ye might have life through his name, John 20.
31.

Why tempt ye God to put a yoke upon the neck of his disciples? etc. But we
believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, we shall be saved even
as they, Acts 15. 10, 11.

I send thee ( said Christ to Paul) to open their eyes, etc. that they might
receive forgiveness of sins, and an inheritance among them who are sanctified
through faith that is in me, Acts 26. 17, 18.

Being justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath, through him, etc.
Much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life, etc. If by one
offense, death reigned by one; how much more they who received abundance of
grace, etc. shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ, etc. That as sin has
reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness, unto
eternal life, by Jesus Christ our Lord, Romans 5. 9, 10, 17, 21.

The gift of God is eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord, Romans 6. 23.

Whom he justifies, them also he glorifies. What shall we say, etc. Romans 8. 30,
31.

I declare unto you the gospel, etc. by which also ye are saved, if, etc. 1
Cor. 15. 1, 2, 3, 4.

In Christ, etc. in whom also we have obtained an inheritance, Ephesians. 1. 11.

God, who is rich in mercy, for the great love wherewith he has loved us, even

ye saved, that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his
grace, etc. for by grace are ye saved through faith, etc. not by works, lest
any man should boast, Ephesians. 2. 4, 5, 7, 8, 9.

Christ in ( or amongst) you, the hope of glory, Colos. 1. 27.

Ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ, in God: and Christ, who is our
life, etc. Col. 3. 3, 4.

Jesus, who delivered us from the wrath to come, 1 These. 1. 10.

God has not appointed us unto wrath; but to obtain salvation by our Lord
Jesus Christ, who died for us, that whether we wake or sleep, we should live
together with him, 1 These. 5. 9, 10. 2 Timothy 1. 9. chapter 2. 10, 11.

Believe on him to life everlasting, 1 Timothy 1. 16.

Jesus Christ, who has abolished death, and has brought life and immortality
to light, through the gospel, 2 Timothy 1. 10.

Not by works of righteousness, which we have done, but according to his mercy
he has saved us, etc. Tit. 3. 5.

He became the Author of eternal salvation unto all them who obey him, Heb. 5.
9. Ephesians. 5. 23.

By his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained
eternal redemption for us, etc. that they who were called might receive the

In this was manifest the love of God toward us, because that God sent his
only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him, 1 John 4. 9.

This is the record, that God has given unto us eternal life, and this life is
in his Son; he who has the Son, has life, etc. 1 John 5. 10, 11, 12.

etc. Whom he has sent, him ye believe not, etc. And ye will not come to me,
that ye might have life, John 5. 24, 38, 40.

What shall we do, that we may work the works of God? Jesus answered and said
unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he has sent,
etc. He who comes to me, shall never hunger; and he who believes on me, shall
never thirst, etc. This is the will of him who sent me, that every one who

down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever, etc.

That they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them who are

By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which
he obtained witness that he was righteous, etc. By faith Enoch was translated,
that he should not see death, etc. He had this testimony, that he pleased God,

law of my mind, etc. O wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me, etc.
Thanks be to God, through Jesus, etc. So then, with my mind I my self serve the
the law of God: but with the flesh, the law of sin, Romans 7. 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,
20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25.

There is therefore no condemnation to them who are in Christ Jesus; who walk
not after the flesh, but after the spirit, etc. For they who are after the
flesh, do mind the things of the flesh: but they who are after the spirit, the
things of the spirit, etc. If any man have not the spirit of Christ, he is none
of his: and if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the
spirit is life because of righteousness, etc. As many as are led by the spirit
of God, are the sons of God: For ye have not received the spirit of bondage
again to fear; but ye have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry Abba
Father, etc. We our selves groan within our selves, waiting for the adoption,
the redemption of our body, etc. Romans 8. 1, 5, 9, 10, 14, 15, 23.

I have great heaviness, and continual sorrow in my heart, etc. for my
brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh, etc. Romans 9. 2, 3. chapter 10. 1

The preaching of the cross, is, to them who perish, foolishness: but unto us
who are saved, it is the power of God, etc. Christ crucified, unto the Jews a
stumbling block, etc. but unto them who are called, both Jews and Greeks,

Such were some of you, but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, etc. 1 Cor.

That no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost, 1 Cor. 12.

Though I speak with the tongue of men, and of angels, and have not charity, I
am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal: and though I have the gift
of prophecy, and understood all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have
all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am
nothing: And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give
my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profits nothing to me, 1 Cor.
13. 1, 2, 3.

We beholding, etc. the glory of the Lord, etc. are changed into the same
image, etc. by the spirit, 2 Cor. 3. 17, 18.

We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed,
and therefore have I spoken: we also believe, and therefore speak, 2 Cor. 4.
13. Psalm. 26. 10. Acts 4. 20.

In this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed with our house from
heaven, etc. that mortality might be swallowed up of life. We are willing to be
absent from the body, that we may be present with the Lord: wherefore we
labor, that whether present, etc. we may be accepted of him, etc. Knowing
therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men, etc. The love of Christ
constrains us, etc. If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: Old things
are passed away; behold, all things are become new, 2 Cor. 5. 2, 4, 8, 9, 11,
14, 17. Philip. 1. 21, 23.

Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates, etc. We can do nothing
against the truth, but for the truth, 2 Cor. 13. 5, 8.

When it pleased God, etc. to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him,
etc. immediately, I conferred not with flesh and blood, Gal. 1. 15, 16.

I am crucified with Christ; nevertheless, I live; yet not I, but Christ lives
in me, Gal. 2. 20.

The works of the flesh are manifest; which are, adultery, etc. But the fruit
of the spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,
meekness, temperance: And they who are Christ's, have crucified the flesh, with
the affections ( or passions) and lusts, Gal. 5. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24.

God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by
whom ( or whereby) the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world: for in
Jesus Christ, circumcision avails nothing, etc. but a new creature, Gal. 6.
14, 15.

This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, That ye henceforth walk not as
other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their minds, etc. But ye have not not so
learned Christ. If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him,
as the truth is in Jesus, Ephesians. 4. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21.

For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: Walk as
children, etc. for the the fruit of the spirit is in all, goodness,
righteousness and truth, Ephesians. 5. 8, 9.

Some preach Christ out of envy and strife, etc. What then? Notwithstanding, in
every way, whether in pretense, or in truth, Christ is preached; and therein do
I rejoice; yea, and I will rejoice, Philip. 1. 15, 16, 17, 18.

We are the circumcision, who worship God in the spirit, rejoice in Christ
Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh, etc. What things were gain to me,
those I count loss for Christ: yea, doubtless: and I count all things but loss,
for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus, my Lord, etc. that I might
know him, and the power of his resurrection, etc. and be made conformable unto
his death, if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead;
not as though I had already attained, or were already perfect; but I follow
after, etc. but this one thing, forgetting those things which are behind, and
reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark,
etc. Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded, etc. Our
conversation is in heaven, from whence we look for the Savior, etc. Phillip.
3. 3, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20.

I have learned, in whatsoever estate I am, therewith to be content. I know how
to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where, and in all things I am
instructed, both to be full, and to be hungry; both to abound, and to suffer
need: I can do all things through Christ, who strengthnern me, ^hllip. 4. 11,
12, 13.

And brings forth ^ruits, as it does also in you, since the day ye heard and
knew the grace of God in truth, Col. 1. 6.

If ye be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, etc. Set your
affections on things above, not on things on the earth, etc. seeing that ye
have put off the old man, with his deeds; and have put on the new man, which is
renewed in knowledge, after the image of him who created him, Colos. 3. 1, 2,
9, 10.

Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labor of love, etc.
knowing, beloved, your election of God. For our gospel came not unto you in
word only, but also in power, etc. and ye became followers of us, and of the
Lord, having received the word in much affection, etc. ye turned to God, etc.
to serve the living and true God, and to wait for his Son, 1 These. 1. 3, 4, 5,
6, 9, 10.

The word of God, which effectually works also in you who believe: for ye,
brethren, became followers of the Churches of God, which in Judea are in Christ
Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, 1 These.
2. 13, 14.

Ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a
thief: ye are the children of the light, etc. 1 These. 5. 4, 5.

I thank Jesus Christ our Lord, who has enabled me, etc. who was before, a
blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious; but I obtained mercy, etc. Jesus

widows in their affliction; to keep himself unspotted from the world, James 1.
26, 27.

What does it profit, my brethren, though a man say he has faith, and have not

Who is a wise man, and endued with knowledge amongst you? let him show out of
a good conversation his works, with meekness of wisdom. But, if ye have bitter

is from above, is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and ea^^^ to be
entreated; full of mercy, and good fruits, without partiality, and without
hypocrisy: and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace, etc. James 3. 13,

How should man be just with God? ( or before God?) If he will contend with
him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand, etc. Whom though I were righteous,

Him who is weak receive, but not with doubtful disputations ( or not to judge

and let not him who eats not, judge him who eats: for God has received

alike; let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind; he who observes a
day, observes it to the Lord, etc. Why do thou judge thy brother? why do
thou set at naught thy brother, etc.? Let us not therefore judge one another
any more, but judge this rather, that no man put a stumbling block, or an

unclean of it self; but to him who esteems any thing to be unclean, to him it
is unclean. And if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walk thou not

I would that all men were even as I my self: but every man has his proper
gift of God; one after this manner, etc. Is any man called being circumcised;

not be circumcised; Circumcision is nothing, etc. 1 Cor. 7. 7, 18, 19.

every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the Idol unto this hour,
eat it as a thing offered to Idols, and their conscience being weak, is
defiled. But meat commends us not to God, etc. Take heed lest by any means
this liberty of yours become a stumhling block to them who are weak: for if any
man see thee who have knowledge sit at meat in the Idols temple, shall not the
conscience of him which is weak, be emboldned to eat those things which are
offered to Idols, and through thy knowledge shall thy weak brother perish for
whom Christ died? but when ye sin so against the weak brethren, and wound their
weak conscience, ye sin against Christ: wherefore, if meat make my brother to
offend, I will eat no flesh while the world stands, lest I make my brother to
offend, 1 Cor. 8. 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.

gain the Jew, etc. To the weak became I as weak, etc. I am made all things unto
all men, that I might by all means save some, etc. 1 Cor. 9. 19, 20, 21, 22.

things edify not: let no man seek his own, but every man another wealth:
whatsoever is sold in the shambles, that eat asking no question for conscience
sake, for the earth is the Lords, etc. If any of them who believe not, bid you,
and ye be disposed to go, whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question
for conscience sake. But if any man say unto thee, this is offered in sacrifice
unto Idols: eat not for his sake who showed it, and for conscience sake, etc.
conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the others, etc. Give none offense,
neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the Church of God; even as I
please all men in all things, not seeking my own profit, but the profit of many
that they may be saved, 1 Cor. 10, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31, 32, 33. chapter

particular so love his wife, even as himself: and the wife see that she
reverence her husband, Ephesians. 5. 22, 23, 24, 25, 28, 33.

Wives submit your selves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.
Husbands love your wives, and be not bitter against them, Col. 3. 18, 19.

In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, etc. Let
the women learn in silence with all subjection: but I suffer not a woman to
teach, or usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence. For Adam was

Satuts in their Afflictions, and under Persecutions.

Privilege; and that too for such Ends. See them last before.
Cons. 2. That such who are so exercised, are blessed and happy, and so
pronounced in Scripture; a Seal of their Sonship, and God's choice Love to
them, and of their Salvation.
BEhold, happy is the man whom God corrects, etc. for he makes sore, and
binds up, etc. Job 5. 17, 18.

against the Saints, than what God permits. He turns about their Purposes.

Why do the Heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing? The kings of the

If therefore the whole Church be come together into one place, etc. If all
prophecy, etc. How is it then brethren? When ye come together, every one has

God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all the Churches of the

I am with you in the spirit, joying, and beholding your order, Col. 2. 5.

Comfort your selves together, and edify one another: even as also ye do, 1
These. 5. 11.

Let us consider one another, to provoke one another to love and good works:
not forsaking the assembling of our selves together, as the manner of some is:
but exhorting one another, Heb. 10. 24, 25.

My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory,
with respect of persons: for if there come into your assembly ( or, Synagogue)
a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel; and there come in also a poor man in
vile raiment, and ye have respect unto him who wears the gay clothing, and
say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place: and say unto the poor, Stand thou
there; or, Sit here under my footstool; are you not then partial, etc. has not
God chosen the poor of this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom?
etc. If ye fulfill the royal law, etc. thou shall love thy neighbor as thy
self, ye do well: but if ye respect persons, ye commit sin, James 2. 1, to v.
10.

Seventhly, Of the Gifts which the Members of Churches received: Of Prayer,
Prophesying, Psalms, Tongues, etc. and how they did use them in the
Church Assemblies, and elsewhere, for the Edification and Good one of another,
and of others: The Order how they should be Used, Directed: Such Gifts to be
desired for this end.
ELdad ad Medad prophefied in the camp: and there ran a young man, and told
Moses and Joshua, etc. said, My Lord Moses, forbid them: and Moses said unto
him, Enviest thou for my sake? Would God that all the Lord's people were
Prophets, and that the Lord would put his spirit upon them, Numbers 11. 26, 27,
28, 29.

Solomon stood before the altar of the Lord in the presence of all the
Congregation, and spread forth his hand toward heaven, and said, Lord God of
Israel, etc. 1 Kings 8. 22, 23, etc.

Jehoshaphat stood in the Congregation, etc. in the house of the Lord, etc. and
said, O Lord God of our fathers, art not thou God in heaven? etc. 2 Chronicles. 20.
4, 5, etc.

Then they who feared the Lord, spoke often one to another: and the Lord
hearkened, etc. They shall be mine, says the Lord of Hosts, Mal. 3. 16, 17.

John said, Master, We saw one casting out devils in thy name, and he followed
not us, and we forbad him: but Jesus said, Forbid him not, for there is no man
which shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me: for he
who is not against us, is on our part, Mark 9. 38, 39, 40. Luke 9. 50.

The Jews used to have such speak in their Synagogue, who were not either
priests, or other officers, as appears in these instances, Luke 4. 16, to v.
22. Acts 13. 14, to v. 19. chapter 17. 1, 2, 3.

There was a great persecution against the Church which was at Jerusalem: and
they were all seattered abroad, etc. except the Apostles, etc. therefore they
who were scattered abroad, went everywhere preaching the word, Acts 8. 1, 4.

Now they who were scattered, etc. when they were come to Antioch, spoke unto
the Grecians, preaching the Lord Jesus, and the hand of the Lord was with them:
and a great number believed, and turned unto the Lord, Acts 11. 19, 20, 21.

Apollos, an eloquent man, and mighty in the Scriptures, etc. he taught
diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John, etc. who
when Aquilla and Priscilla had taught the way of God more perfectly, did
mightily convince the Jews, and that publicly, showing by the Scriptures, that
Jesus was Christ, Acts 18. 24, to v. 29.

Think soberly, according as God has dealt to every man the measure of faith.
For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same
office: so we being many, etc. Having then gifts differing, according to the
grace which is given to us, whether prophecy let us prophecy, according to the
proportion of faith, etc. Or he that teaches, on teaching: or he who
exhorts, on exhortation, etc. he who rules, with diligence, Romans 12. 3, to
v. 9.

I my self am also persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye also are full of
goodness, filled with knowledge, able also to admonish one another, Romans 15. 14.

I thank my God, etc. that in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all
utterance, and in all knowledge, 1 Cor. 1. 4, 5.

Now there are diversity of gifts, but the same spirit, etc. But the
manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit withal. For to one
is given by the spirit the word of wisdom, to another the word of knowledge,
etc. to another faith, etc. to another prophecy, etc. But all these works
that one and the self-same spirit, dividing to every man severally, as he will,
etc. If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body,
etc. God has set the members every one of them in the body, as it has pleased
him, etc. Are all Apostles; etc. Have all the gift of healing? Do all speak
with tongues? etc. But covet earnestly the best gifts, 1 Cor. 12, 4, 7, 8, 9,
11, 15, 18, 28, 29, 30, 31.

Desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophecy, etc. He who
prophesies, speaks unto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort,
etc. He edifieth the Church, etc. Forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual
gifts, seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the Church, etc. If all
prophecy, and there come in one that believes not, etc. he is convinced of
all, etc. will report that God is in you of a truth. How is it, brethren, that
when ye come together, every one of you have a psalm, etc. let all things be
done to edifying, etc. Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other
judge. If any thing be revealed to another who sits by, let the first hold
his peace. For ye may all prophecy one by one, that ye may learn, and all my
be comforted. And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets. For
God, etc. Let your women keep silence in the Churches, etc. Wherefore brethren,
covet to prophecy, etc. Let all things be done decently, and in order, 1 Cor.
14. 1, 3, 4, 5, 12, 23, 24, 25, 26, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 39, 40.

We also believe, therefore speak, 2 Cor. 4. 13.

As ye bound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge. 2 Cor. 8.
7.

Be ye filled with the spirit, speaking among your selves mutually in psalms,
etc. singing, etc. Ephesians. 5. 18, 19.

bold to speak the word, etc. Some preach Christ out of envy, etc. What then?
etc. Christ is preached, and I therein do rejoice, etc. Phil. 1. 14, 15, 16,
17, 18.

Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, in all wisdom, teaching and
admonishing one another, Col. 3. 16.

Comfort ( or, exhort) one another, with these words, 1 These. 4. 18.

Wherefore comfort your selves together, and edify one another, even as also
ye do, 1 These. 5. 11.

Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief,
etc. But exhort one another daily, etc. lest any of you be hardened through the
deceitfulness of sin, Heb. 3. 12, 13.

For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you
again, which be the first principles of the oracles of God, Heb. 5. 12.

Let us consider one another, etc. not forsaking the assemblies of our selves
together, as the manner of some is, but exhorting one another; and so much the,
etc. Heb. 10. 24, 25.

As every man has received the gift, even so minister the same one to another,
as good stewards of the manifold grace of God. If any man speak, let him speak
as the oracles of God: if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability
which God gives, that God in all things may be glorified, 1 Pet. 4. 10, 11.

Eighthly, Of other Acts done in and by these particular Churches, in sending
out Messengers to other Churches; and upon Occasions, determining of
Controversies in Religious Matters; writing and sending Epistles, and ordering
other Affairs. Of their meeting together, in order hereto, and receiving, and
hearing such Epistles: The Epistles directed to the whole Body, and they
concerned in it.
WHen tidings of the Gentiles receiving the Gosph, came unto the cars of the
Church which was in Jerusalem they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as
far as Antioch, etc. When the Dearth was prophesied of, the Disciples, every
man according to his ^oility, determined to send relief unto the brethren who
dwelt in Judea. Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of
Barnabas and Saul, Acts 11. 20, 21, 22, 28, 29, 30.

Paul and Barnabas coming to Antioch, gathered the Church together, and
rehearsed all that God had done for them, and how, etc. Acts 14. 26, 27.

When the matter of circumcision was in dispute in the Church at Antioch; they
determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to
Jerusalem unto the Apostles and Elders, about this question. And being brought
on their way by the church, etc. when they were come to Jerusalem, they were
received by the church, and of the Apostles, etc. All the multitude kept
silence, and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, etc. Then James spoke, etc.
Then pleased it the Apostles and elders, with the whole Church, to send chosen
men of their own company to Antioch, etc. and wrote letters, by them after this
manner: The Apostles, elders, and brethren, send greeting unto the brethren
which are, etc. It seems good to us, being assembled with one accord, to send
chosen men unto you, etc. it seems good to the holy Ghost, and to us, etc. They
came to Antioch, and when they had gathered the multitude together, they
delivered the Epistle, Acts 15. 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, 13, 22, 23, 25, 27, 28, 30.

If then ye have judgment of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge
who are least esteemed in the Church, 1 Cor. 6. 4.

When I come, whomsoever you shall approve by letters, them will I send to
bring your liberality unto Jerusalem, 1 Cor. 16. 3.

We have sent with him the brother, etc. who was also chosen of the churches to
travel with us, with this grace ( or, gift), etc. Whether any do enquire, etc.
of our brethren, they are the messengers of the Churches, 2 Cor. 8. 18, 19, 23.

I suppose it necessary to send unto you Epaphroditus, etc. your messenger, and
he who ministered to my wants, Phil. 2. 25.

When this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also in the Church
of the Laodiceans: and that ye likewise read the epistle from Laodicea. And say
to Archippus, take heed to the ministry which thou have received of the Lord,
that thou fulfill it, Col. 4. 16, 17.

I charge you by the Lord, that this epistle be read to all the holy brethren,
1 These. 5. 27.

Salute all them who have the rule over you, and all the Saints, Heb. 13. 24.

Peter having written at large to the Saints, speaks distanctly to the elders,
thus: To the elders which are among you: I exhort, etc. to feed the slock of
God, etc. 1 Pet. 5. 1, 2, 3.

I wrote to the Church, but Diotrephes who loved to have the pre-eminence among
them, received us not: wherefore if I come, I will remember his deeds, etc. Not
content herewith, neither does he himself receive the brethren, and forbids
them that would, and casts them out of the Church. Beloved, follow not that
which is evil, 3 John, v. 9, 10, 11.

John wrote to the seven Churches in Asia distinctly, though they were in one
country, and charges each Church with its own guilt, and commends each Church
by it self: takes no notice of any power any had over other. He directs his
epistles to the Angel of the Church: but the matter he speaks to the whole
Church: and concludes, Hear what the spirit says unto the Churches, Rev. 1. 4.
chapter 2. chapter 3.

See mere of Church-Acts, in Discipline.

Ninthly, Of the ending of Controverses arising between the Members of the
Churches, to avoid going to Law before others.
DAre any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust,
and not before the Saints? do ye not know, that the Saints shall judge the
world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the
smallest matters? know ye not, that we shall judge Angels? how much more,
things which pertain to this life? etc. Set them to judge who are least
esteemed in the Church. I speak to your shame, Is it so that there is not a
wise man among you? no, not one who shall be able to judge between his
brethren: but brother goes to law with brother, and that before the
unbelievers. Now therefore, there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go
to law one with another: why do ye not rather take wrong? etc. 1 Cor. 6, 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

Tenthly, Of the Relief of the Poor of the Churches, and their Contributions to
the Necessity of other Churches, and the Order of it.
AND the multitude of them who believed, were of one heart, etc. Neither said

had all things common, etc. Neither was there any among them that lacked: for

prises, etc. and laid them down at the Apostles feet: and distribution was made
unto every man according as he had ^^ed, Acts 4. 32, 34, 35.

it was sold, was it not in thine own power? why have thou? etc. Acts 5. 1, 2,
3, 4.

When the number of the disciples were multiplied, there arose a murmuring
against the Hebrews, by the Grecians, because their widows were neglected in
the daily ministration. Whereupon the Church chose Deacons to look to this
matter, Acts 6. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

The Disciples, every one according to his ability, determined to send relief
unto the brethren, etc. Acts 11. 28, 29, 30.

weak, and to remember the words of our Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more
blessed to give, than to receive, Acts 20. 34, 35.

It has pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution
for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem, Romans 15. 25, 26.

you lay by him in store, as God has prospered him, that there be no gathering
when, etc. 1 Cor. 16. 1, 2.

-- By the occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of
your love: for ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was
rich, etc. Not that other men be eased, and you burdened: but by an equalility,
etc. 2 Cor. 8. 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 13, 14.

Every man according as he purposes in his heart, so let him give, not
grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loves a cheerful giver, etc. The
administration of this Service, not only supplieth the want of the Saints, but
it is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God, etc. They glorify God for
your professed subjection to Jesus Christ, 2 Cor. 9. 7, 12, 13.

If any would not work, neither should he eat, etc. But ye, brethren, be not
weary in welldoing, etc. 2 These 3. 10, 11, 12, 13.

If any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to show pity at
home, and to requite their parents, etc. If any provide not for his own, etc.
If any man or woman who believes, have widows, let them relieve them: and let
not the Church be charged, that it may relieve them who are widows indeed, 1 Timothy 5. 4, 8, 16.

seven men of honest report, full of the holy Ghost and wisdom, etc. we will
give our selves continually to prayer and the ministry of the word, Acts 6. 1,
2, 3, 4.

Paul sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the Church, etc. he said unto
them, etc. Take heed therefore to your selves, and to all the flock, over the
which the holy Ghost has made you overseers ( or, Bishops), to seed the Church
of God, etc. I know this, that after my departure, grievous wolves shall enter,
etc. therefore watch, etc. and I have showed you all things, how that so
laboring, ye ought to support the weak: and remember the words of our Lord

must be blameless, the husband of one wife: vigilant, sober, of good behavior
( or, modest); given to hospitality, apt to teach; not given to wine, no
striker, nor greedy of filthy lucre, but patient: not a brawler, not covetous:
one who rules well his own house, having his children in subjection with all
gravity: for if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take
care of the Church of God? not a novice ( or, one newly come to the faith),
lest being lifted up with pride, he fall into the condemnation of the devil.
Likewise must the Deacons be grave, not double-tongued, not given to much wine,

The things thou have heard of me, among many witnesses, the same commit thou
to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also, etc. a workman that

25.

riot, or unruly; for a Bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God: not

lucre, but a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy,

among you ( or, as much as in you is); taking the oversight thereof, not by
constraint, but willingly: not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; neither
as being lords ( or, overruling) over God's heritage, but being examples of
the flock, 1 Pet. 5. 1, 2, 3, 4.

Diotrephes, who loves to have the pre-eminence, received us not, 3 John, v.

II. Complaints of, and Threatenings against Evil Officers, or Ministers of the
Church.
HIS watchmen are blind, they are all ignorant, they are all dumb dogs: they
cannot bark, sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber: yea, they are greedy dogs
who can never have enough, and they are shepherds who cannot understand: they
all look to their own way, every one for his gain from his quarter: come ye,
say they, I will fetch wine, and we will fill our selves with strong drink, and
to morrow shall be as to day, Isa. 56. 10, 11, 12.

The Priests said not, Where is the Lord? and they who handled the law, knew me
not: the Pastors also transgressed against me, etc. Wherefore I will yet plead,
etc. Jer. 2. 8, 9.

my people love to have it so: and what will ye do in the end thereof? Jer. 5.

From the Prophet unto the Priest, every one deals falsely: they have healed
also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, etc. when,
etc. Jer. 6. 13, 14. chapter 8. 10, 11.

The Pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the Lord: therefore they
shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be scattered, Jer. 10. 21.

Many Pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion, etc.
Jer. 12. 10, 11.

Woe unto the Pastors who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture, says the
Lord: therefore thus says the Lord, etc. against the Pastors who feed my
people, Ye have scattered my flock, and driven them away, and have not visited
them: Behold, I will visit upon you the evil of your doings, etc. The Prophets,
etc. They strengthen the hands of evildoers, so that none do return from his
wickedness, Jer. 23. 1, 2.

The Priests and the Prophets advise to put Jeremiah to death, because he told
them what God spoke, Jer. 26. 10, 11, 16.

Her Priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy things: they
have put no difference between the holy and profane, neither have they showed
difference between the unclean, and the clean, Ezekiel. 22. 26.

Woe to the shepherds of Israel who do feed themselves: should not the shepherds
feed the flock? ye eat the fat, and ye clothe your selves with the wool, etc.

healed that which was sick, etc. but with force and with cruelty have ye ruled,

way: ye have caused many to stumble at the law; ye have corrupted the covenant
of Levi, etc. therefore have I also made you contemptible, etc. before the
people, Mal. 2. 7, 8, 9.

He who is an hireling, etc. sees the wolf coming, and leaves the sheep, and
flees; and the wolf catches them, and scatters the sheep, etc. John 10. 12,

warfare at any time, at his own charges? etc. Say I these things as a man? or
faith not the law the same also? Thou shall not muzzle the mouth of the ox
which treads out the corn, etc. Does God take care for oxen? or says he it
not altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, etc. If we have sown
unto you in spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal
things? etc. Nevertheless, we have not used this power, etc. lest we should
hinder the gospel, Do ye not know, that they who minister about holy things,
live ( or, feed) of the things of the temple? etc. Even so has the Lord
ordained, that they who preach the gospel, should live of the gosple, 1 Cor. 9.

in the Lord, and admonish you: and esteem them very highly in love, for their

Let the elders who rule well, be counted worthy of double honor; especially

John said, I indeed baptize you with water: but one mightier than I, comes,
etc. he shall baptize you with the holy Ghost and with fire, Luke 3. 16. Acts
11. 15, 16. John 1, 26, 31, 33. Acts ^. 5.

Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples, John 4. 1, 2.

Repent and be baptized every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for the
remission of sins: for the promise is unto you, and to your children, etc. then
they who gladly received the word, were baptized, Acts 2. 38, 39, 41. chapter 22.
26.

But when they believed. etc. they were baptized both men and women, etc. Simon
was baptized, etc. The Eunuch said, Here is water, what hinders me to be
baptized? and Philip said, If thou believe with all thine heart, thou may,
etc. they went down into the water, and he baptized him, Acts 8. 12, 13, 36,
37, 38.

Saul arose, and was baptized, Acts 9. 18. chap. 22. 16.

Can any man forbid water that these should not be baptized, who have received
the holy Ghost as well as we? and he commanded them to be baptized in the name,
etc. Acts 10. 47, 48.

Who shall tell thee words whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved, Acts
11. 14.

Lydia, etc. whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things
which were spoken of Paul: and when she was baptized and her household, etc.
believe on the Lord Jesus and thou shall be saved, thou and thine house, etc.
and he took them the same hour, etc. and was baptized, he, and all his
straightway, Acts 16. 14, 15, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34.

Some who were baptized with John's baptism, were baptized again, Acts 19. 3,
4, 5.

Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ, were
baptized into his death, buried, etc? Romans 6. 3, 4.

I baptized also the house of Stephanus: besides, I know not whether I, etc. 1
Cor. 1. 16.

The unbelieving husband is sanctified by the believing wife: and the
unbelieving wife is sanctified by the believing husband, otherwise were your
children unclean: but now they are holy, 1 Cor. 7. 14.

Leaving the principles, etc. of the doctrine of Baptisms, Heb. 6. 1, 2.

The ark wherein few, etc. were saved by water: the like figure whereunto even
baptism does also now save us: not the putting away of the filth of the flesh,
but the answer of a good conscience toward God, by the resurrection of Jesus
Christ, 1 Pet. 3. 20, 21.

IV. Breaking of Bread, or, the Lord's Supper.
THE Passover instituted: and all the directions about it, Exodus 12.

The doubt, whether one unclean might eat the passover resolved by God unto
Moses, Numb. 9. 6, 7, etc.

The people not prepared, yet did eat: Hezeki^h prayed for them, 2 C^r. 30. 18,
1^.

As they were eating, Jesus took bread and blessed it, and b^ake it, and gave
it to his Disciples, and said, Take, eat, this is my body: and he took the cup
and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it, for this is
my blood of the new Testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins:
but he said unto them, I will not drink it henceforth, etc. and when they had
sung, etc. Matthew. 26. 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.

They all drank of the cup, Mark 14. 23.

He sat down, and the twelve Apostles with him, etc. He took the cup and gave
thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among your selves, etc. And he took
bread and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying. This is my
body which is given for you, this do in remembrance of me. Likewise also the
cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new Testament in my blood, which is
shed for you, Luke 22. 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.

When Judas had received the sop at supper, he went immediately out, John 13.
26, 30.

And they continued sted^astly, etc. in breaking of bread, Acts 2. 42.

Upon the first day of the week when the Disciples came together to break
bread, etc. Paul preached to them, etc. in the upper chamber where they were
gathered together, etc. When he therefore was come up again, and had broken
bread, etc. Acts 20. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, etc. let us
keep the feast, not with old leaven, etc. but with the unleavened bread of
sincerity, 1 Cor. 5. 7, 8.

The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of
Christ? the bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of
Christ? for we being many, are one bread and one body: for we are all partakers
of that one bread, etc. ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of
devils: ye cannot, etc. 1 Cor. 10. 16, 17, 21, 22.

When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's
supper ( or, ye cannot eat): for in eating, every one takes before other his
own supper; and one is hungry, and another is drunken: what, have ye not houses
to eat and to drink in? or despise you the Church of God, and shame them that
have not ( or, are poor)? for I have received of the Lord that which also I
delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was
betrayed, took bread, and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take
eat, this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in ( or, for a)
remembrance of me. After the same manner also he took the cup when he had
supped, saying, This cup is the new Testament in my blood, this do ye, as often
as ye drink it, in remembrance of me: for as often as ye eat thus bread, and
drink this cup, ye do show, ( (...) ye) the Lord's death till he come:
wherefore, whosoever shall eat this bread^ and drink this cup of the Lord
unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord, etc. he who
eats, etc. unworthily, eats and drinks d^mnation to himself, not
discer^ing the Lord's body, etc. When ye come together to eat, tarry one for
another: and if any man hunger, let him eat at home, 1 Cor. 11. 17, 20, 21, 22,
23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29, 33, 34.

and his habitation without the campalone, Levit. 13. 44, 46.

When he was to be brought into the camp again, he was first to be pronounced
clean by the Priest, after he had viewed him and offered sacrifices for him,

4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14, 15.

themselves from the people of the land, etc. for they have taken of their

etc. Ezra 9. 1, 2.

They read in the book of Moses, etc. that the (...) should not come into the
congregation^ (...) God for ever, etc. Now it came to pass when they had heard
the (...), that they separated from Israel all the mixed m^titude, Ne^em. 13.

cause men to discern between the unclean and the clean, Ezekiel. 44. 23.

Ephraim has mixed himself among the people, etc. a cake not turned, Hosea 7.
8.

heaven: and whatsoever thou shall bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven:

19.

If thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between
him and thee: if he will hear thee, thou shall gain thy brother: but if he will
not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or
three witnesses every word may be established: and if he shall neglect to hear
them, tell it to the Church: but if he neglect to hear the Church, let him be
unto thee as an heathen man and a publican; verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever

on earth, etc. Matthew. 18. 15, 16, 17, 18. John 20. 21, 22. 23.

It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such, etc.
and ye are pussed up, and have not rather mourned, that he who has done this
deed, might have been taken away from among you, etc. In the name of our Lord
Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of
our Lord Jesus, to deliver such a one unto Satan for the destruction of the
flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus, etc. know ye
not that a little leaven leavens the whole lump, etc? I wrote to you in an
Epistle, not to keep company with fornicators, yet not altogether with the
fornicators of this world, etc. But if any man that is called a brother, be a
fornicator, or covetous, or an idolator, etc. with such a one, no not to ^at:
for what have I do with them who are without? do not ye judge them who are
within, etc? therefore put away from among your selves that wicked person, 1
Cor. 5.

Sufficient to such a man was this punishment ( or, censure) which was

14, 15, 16, 17, 18.

When Paul had written to the Galatians about some who troubled them, and would
pervert the Gospel of Christ, etc. had preached the circumci^ion, etc. he said
to them, Ye did run well, who did hinder you, that ye should not obey the
truth? this persuasion comes not from him who calls you: a little leaven
leaveneth the whole lump: I have confidence in you through the Lord, that you
will be none otherwise minded: but he who troubles you shall bear his
judgment, whosoever he be, etc. I would they were even cut off who trouble you:
for brethren, ye have been called to liberty, Gal. 1. 6, 7, 8. Gal. 5. 7, 8, 9,
10, 11, 12, 13.

If any man be overtaken in a fault, ye who are spiritual restore such a one in

heart, etc. Revel. 2. 2, 14, 15, 20, 23.

garments, and love the upper most rooms at fea^ts, and the chief seats in the
Synagogues, and greetings in the markets, and to be called of men Rabbi, Rabbi,

counsel together to put him to death, John 11. 44, 46, 47, 48, 53, 57.

of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled

God had made: And he said unto the woman, Yea, because ( or, has) God said, Ye
shall not eat of every tree of the garden? The woman said, etc. We may eat,
etc. but of the fruit of the tree in the midst of the garden, God has said, Ye
shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. And the serpent
said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die; for God does know, that in the
day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be open, and ye shall be as gods,
knowing good and evil. And the woman saw that the tree was good, Genesis 3. 1, to
7.

Satan was a lying Spirit in the Prophets, to persuade Ahab, etc. 1 Kings 22.
21, 22, 23. 2 Chronicles. 20. 21, 22.

And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel, 1 Chronicles. 21. 1. 2 Samuel 24. 1.

Now there was a day, when the sons of God came to present themselves before
the Lord: and Satan ( or, the adversary) came also among ( or, in the (...) of)
them, etc. The Lord said to Satan, From whence come thou? Then said he, etc.
From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it, etc. He
said, Does Job serve God for naught? Have thou not made an hedge about him?
etc. Put forth thine hand, and touch that which he has, and he will curse thee
to thy face, etc. Then Satan, having leave given him, destroyed all he had, Job
1. 6, 7, to the end; chapter 2. 1, 2, 3.

Have thou considered my servant Job? etc. still he holds fast his integrity,
although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without a cause. And Satan
answered the Lord, and said, Skin for skin; yea, and all that a man has, will
he give for his life: but put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone, and his
flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face. And the Lord said, He is in thine
hand; but ( or, only) save his life. So went Satan, etc. and smote Job, Job 2.
3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

And he showed me Joshua the high priest, standing before the Angel of the
Lord; and Satan standing on his right hand, to resist him. And the Angel said
unto Satan, The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan; even the Lord, who has chosen, etc.
Zech. 3. 1, 2.

Jesus, etc. in the wilderness, to be tempted of the devil. When he had fasted,
etc. the tempter came to him: He said, If thou be the Son of God, command that
these stones be made bread. But he answered, and said, It is written, etc. Then
the devil takes him, etc. and sets him on a pinnacle of the temple, and
says unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thy self down: For it is
written, He shall give his Angels charge, etc. Jesus said, It is written again,
etc. The devil, etc. shows him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of
them; and says unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou will fall
down and worship me, etc. Get thee hence, Satan; for it is written, Thou shall
worship the Lord thy God; and him only shall thou serve, Matthew. 4. 1, to 12.

When Jesus was come on the other side, etc. there met him two possessed with
devils, etc. they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou
Son of God? Art thou come hither to torment us before our time? etc. So the
devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer us to go away into the
herd of swine. And he said unto them, Go, etc. The whole city came out, and
besought him, that he would depart out of their coasts, Matthew. 8. 28, to 35.
Mark 5. 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. Luke 8. 27, 28, etc.

When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walks through dry places,
seeking rest, and finding none. Then he says, I will return to my house, from
whence I came out: And when he is come, he finds it empty, swept and
garnished. then goes he, and takes with him seven other spirits, more wicked
than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and the last state of that
man is worse, etc. Matthew. 12. 43, 44, 45.

When any one hears the word, etc. and understands it not; then comes the
wicked one, and, etc. The tares are, the children of the wicked one: the enemy
who sowed them, is the devil, Matthew. 13. 10, 38, 39.

Jesus rebuked the devil, and he departed out of him, and the child was cured,
etc. Howbeit, this kind goes not out, but by prayer and fasting, Matthew. 17.
18, 21.

Christ suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him, Mark 1. 34.

Lord, even the devils are subject to us, through thy name. And he said unto
them, I beheld Satan, as lightning, fall from heaven, Luke 10. 17, 18.

And he was casting out a devil, etc. Some of them said, He casts out devils
by Beelzebub, the chief of the devils, etc. If Satan also be divided against
himself, how shall his kingdom stand? etc. If I by Beelzebub cast out devils,
by whom do your children cast them out? Luke 11. 14, 15, 17, to 21. Mark 3. 22,
23.

Ought not this woman, etc. whom Satan has bound, etc. be loosed? etc. Luke
13. 16.

but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not, Luke 22. 31, 32.

truth in him: when he speaks of a lie, he speaks of his own; for he is a
liar, and the father of it, John 8. 44.

The devil having now put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to
betray, etc. After Jesus had given the sop to Judas, satan entered into^ him,

Ghost? Acts 5. 3.

world has blinded the mind of them who believe not, le^t the light or the
glorious gospel, etc. 2 Cor. 4. 3, 4.

that now works in the children of disobedience, Ephesians. 2. 2.

Let not the sun go down upon your wrath, neither give place to the devil,

Put on the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles
of the dev^^: for we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against
principalities and powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world,
against spiritual wickednesses ( or, wicked spirits) in high places: Wherefore
take unto you the whole armor, etc. above all things, the shield of faith;
whereby ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one*

I write unto you, young men; because ye have overcome the wicked one, 1 John
2. 13, 14. chapter 5. 18. 2 These. 3. 3.

He who commits sin, is of the devil; for the devil sins from the
beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifest, that he might destroy
the works of the devil: not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his
brother, 1 John 3. 8, 12.

The Angels who kept not their first state ( or, principalities) he has
reserved in everlasting chains. The A^changel, when contending with the devil
about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation; but
said, The Lord rebuke thee, Jude, verse. 6, 9.

The devil was a lying spirit in the prophets, to deceive Ahab, 1 Kings 22. 19,
20, 23. Ezekiel. 12. 9.

The prophets prophecy lies in my name; I sent them not, neither have I
commanded them, neither spoke unto them: they prophecy unto you a false vision
and divination, and a thing of naught, and the deceit of their heart, Jer. 14.
14, 15.

Beware of false propets, who come to you in she^p's clothing; but inwardly
they are ravening wolves: ye shall know them by their fruits, etc. We have
prophesied in thy name, cast out devils, and done many wonderful works, Matthew.
7. 15, 16, 22, 23.

Take heed, etc. of the leaven of the Pharisees, etc. of the doctrine of the
Pharisees, etc. Matthew. 16. 6, 11, 12.

Take heed that no man deceive you: for many shall come in my name, and say, I
am Christ; and shall deceive many, etc. Many false prophets shall arise, and
deceive many, etc. Then if any shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there
is Christ, believe it not: for there shall arise false Christ's, and false
prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders; insomuch that (if it were
possible) they should deceive the very elect. Behold, I have told you before:
wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert, etc. go not
forth, etc. For as the lightning comes out of the east, etc. so shall also the
coming of the Son of man, etc. Matthew. 24. 4, 5, 11, 23, to 28.

Certain, etc. have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying,
etc. Acts 15. 1, 24.

After my departure shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the
flock: Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to
draw away disciples after them: therefore watch, Acts 20. 28, to 32.

The Sadduces say, that there is no resurrection, nor angels, nor spirit, Acts
23. 8, 9.

Mark them who cause divisions, etc. contrary to the doctrine, etc. and avoid
them: for they who are such, serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own
belly; and by good words, and fair speeches, deceive the hearts of the simple,
Romans 16. 17, 18.

There must be also herenes among you, that they who are approved, might be
made, etc. 1 Cor. 11. 19.

How say some among you, That there is no resurrection from the dead? 1 Cor.
15. 12.

We are not as many, who corrupt the word of God, etc. 2 Cor. 2. 17.

Them who desire occasion, etc. for such are false Apostles, deceitful workers;
transforming themselves into the Apostles of Christ, etc. Satan himself is
transformed into an Angel of light: therefore it is no great thing if his
ministers be transformed into the ministers of righteousness; whose ends shall
be according to their works, etc. Ye suffer fools gladly, etc. ye suffer if a
man bring you into bondage: if a man devour, if a man take, if a man exalt
himself, etc. smite you on the face, 2 Cor. 11. 12, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20.

There be some who trouble you, and would pervert the Gospel of Christ: Though
we, or an Angel from heaven, preach any other Gospel unto you, than that we
have preached unto you, let him be accursed: As we have before, so say I now
again, If any man preach any other Gospel unto you, than that ye have received,
let him be accursed, Gal. 1. 7, 8, 9.

False brethren, who came in privily to spy out our liberty, etc. that they
might bring us into bondage; to whom we gave place by subjection, no not for an
hour, that the truth of the Gospel may continue with you: but of these who seem
to be, etc. Gal. 2. 3, 4, 5, 6.

They zealously affect you, but not well: yea, they would exclude you, that you
might affect them, Gal. 4. 17.

As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh, they constrain you to be
circumcised, only left they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ:
for neither they themselves that are circumcised keep the law; but desire to
have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh, Gal. 6. 12, 13.
Philip. 3. 2.

Be no more children, tossed, etc. with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive, Ephesians. 4.
14.

This I say, lest any should beguile you with enticing words, etc. Beware, lest
any one spoil you through philosophy, and vain deceits, after the traditions of
men, after the rudiments of this world, and not after Christ, etc. Let no man
judge you in meat, ( or, for eating,) etc. intruding into those things which he
has not seen, etc. and not holding the head, etc. Why are ye subject to
ordinances? etc. Touch not, etc. Col. 2, 4, 8, 16, to 24.

Let no man deceive you by any means, etc. That man of sin, etc. who opposes
and exalts himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped: so
that he, as God, sits in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God,
etc. Then shall that wicked one be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with
the spirit of his mouth, and destroy with the brightness of his coming; whose
coming is after the working of Satan, with all power, and signs, and lying
wonders, and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them who perish:
Because they received not the love of the truth, etc. for this cause God shall
send them strong delusions, that they should believe a lie; that they all might
be damned, etc. 2 These. 2. 2, 3, 4, 8, to 13. Rev. 13. 13, 14.

Charge some, that they teach no other doctrine; neither give heed to Jewish
fables, etc. Some have swerved, having turned aside to vain janglings, desiring
to be teachers of the law, understanding neither what they say, nor whereof
they affirm, 1 Timothy 1. 3, 4, 6, 7, 8.

Now the Spirit speaks expressly, that in the latter days some shall depart
from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;
speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their consciences ^eared with a hot iron:
forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, etc. 1 Timothy 4. 1, 2,
3.

If any man teach otherwise, etc. he is proud, knowing nothing; but doting (
or, sick) about questions and strifes of words, whereof comes envy; etc.
perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth;
supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thy self. Some, etc. have
erred, 1 Timothy 6. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 20, 21.

Strive not about words to no profit, to the subverting of the hearers, etc.
Shun profane and vain babbling, for they will increase to more ungodliness; and
their word will eat, as does a canker, ( or, gangrene:) Of whom is Hymeneus,
etc. Who, concerning the truth, have erred; saying, That the resurrection is
past already; and overthrow the faith of some: nevertheless, the foundation of
God stands sure, etc. 2 Timothy 2. 14, 16, 17, 18, 19.

Perilous times shall come; for men shall be lovers of their own selves,
covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful,
unholy, without natural affection, truce breakers, false accusers, incontinent,
fierce, despisers of those who are good, traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers
of pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but denying
the power thereof: from such turn away; for of this sort are they who creep
into houses, and lead captive silly women; laden with sins, led away with
diverse lusts, ever learning, and never coming to the knowledge of the truth.
Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth
men of corrupt minds, reprobate ( or, of no judgment) concerning the faith,
etc. But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse; deceiving and being
deceived: but continue thou in the things, etc. 2 Timothy 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 13, 14.

The time will come, when they will not endure found doctrine; but after their
own lusts, shall they heap up to themselves teachers; having itching ears: and
they shall turn away their ears from truth, and shall be turned unto fables:
But watch thou, etc. 2 Timothy 4. 3, 4, 5.

A bishop must be blameless, etc. holding fast the faithful word, as he has
been taught, ( or, in teaching;) that he may be able by found doctrine, both to
exhort and convince the gainsayers: for there are many unruly and vain talkers
and deceivers, especially they of the circumcision; whose mouths must be
stopped, who subvert whole houses; teaching things which they ought not, for
filthy lucre sake, and. Rebuke them sharply, etc. not giving heed to Jewish
fables, and commandments of men, who turn from the truth, etc. They profess
that they know God, but in works they deny him; being, etc. Titus 1. 7, 9, 10,
11, 13, 14, 16.

Be not carried about with diverse and strange dectrines: for it is a good
thing, that the heart, etc. Heb. 13. 9.

But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be
falie teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even
denying the Lord, who bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction:
and many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom, the way of
truth shall be evil spoken of: and through covetousness shall they, with
seigned words, make merchandise of you; whose judgment now of a long time
lingreth not, etc. Chiefly them who walk after the flesh, etc. and despise
government, ( or, dominions,) presumptuous, selfwilled: they are not afraid to
speak evil of digninities, etc. These are as natural brute beasts, etc. speak
evil of the things they understand not, etc. sporting themselves with their own
deceivings, while they feast with you; having eyes full of adultery, who cannot
cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: an heart which is exercised with
covetous practices, etc. who have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray,
etc. These are wells without water, clouds which are carried with a tempest, to
whom the midst of darkness is reserved for ever: for when they speak great
swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, etc.
those who were clean escaped from them; who live in error, while they promise
them, etc. 2 Pet. 2. 1, 2, 3, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19.

There shall come in the last days scossers, walking after their own lusts; and
saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep,
all things continue as they were from the beginning, etc. Some things are hard
to be understood; which they who are unlearned, and unstable, wrest, as they do
also the other scriptures, to their own destruction. Ye therefore, beloved,
seeing ye know before; beware, lest ye also, being led away with the error of
the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness, 2 Pet. 3. 3, 4, 15, 16, 17.

Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard Antichrist shall
come, even now are there many Antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last
time: They went out from us, but they were not of us, etc. Who is a liar, but
he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? He is Antichrist, who denies the
Father, and the Son, etc. These things have I written unto you, concerning them
who deceive you, 1 John 2. 18, 19, 22, 26.

Believe not every spirit; but try the spirits, whether they are of God;
because many false prophets are gone out into the world: Hereby know ye the
spirit of God; every spirit who confesses Jesus Christ to have been come in
the flesh is of God: and every spirit who confesses not that Jesus Christ is
come in the flesh, is not of God: and this is that spirit of Antichrist,
whereof you have heard that it should come; and even now already it is in the
world, etc. Ye are of God, and have overcome them; because greater is he who is
in you, than he in the world. They are of the world, therefore speak they of
the world, and the world heare^^ them, etc. He who is of God, hears us: he
who is not of God, hears not us: Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the
spirit of er^our, etc. 1 John 4. 1, to 7.

Many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is
come in the flesh: this is a deceiver, and an Antichrist: look to your selves,
that we lose not those things which we wrought, etc. Whosoever transgresses,
and abides not in the doctrine of Christ, has not God, etc. If there come any
to you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither
bid him God-speed; for he who bids him Godspeed, is partaker of his evil deeds,
2 John, verse. 7, to 12.

Earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints: for
there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to
this condemnation; ungodly men, turning the grace of God into lasciviousness,
and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ, etc. These filthy
dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominions, and speak evil of dignities: yet
Michael, etc. contending with the devil, etc. durst not bring against him a
railing accusation, etc. These speak evil of those things which they know not,
etc. Clouds they are, without water, etc. These are murmurers, complainers,
walking after their own lusts, and their mouth speaks great swelling words;
having men's persons in admiration, because of advantage, etc. These be they
who separate themselves, sensual, having not the spirit, Jude, verse. 3. 4, 8,
9, 10, 12, 13, 16, 18, 19.

I know the blasphemy of them who say they are Jews, and are not; but are the
synagogue of Satan, etc. hold the doctrine of Balaam, etc. So the doctrine of
the Nicolaitans, etc. Thou suffer that woman Jezebel, who, etc. to teach and
seduce my servants, etc. Rev. 2. 9, 14, 15, 20. chap. 3. 9.

All who dwell on earth, whose names are not written in the book of life, etc.
worshipped the beast, etc. And he had power, etc. That the image of the beast
should both speak; and cause, that as many as would not worship the image of
the beast, should be killed: and causes all, both small and great, rich and
poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their
foreheads: and that no man might buy or sell, save he who had the mark, or the
name of the beast, or the number of his name, Rev. 13. 15, 16, 17.

Unclean spirits out of the mouth of the dragon, beast, and false prophet; the
spirit of devils working miracles, Rev. 16. 13, 14.

I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye
be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues; for her
sins have reached unto heaven, Rev. 18. 4.

If any man worship the beast, and his image, and receive his mark in his
forehead, or his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God,
Rev. 14. 9, 10.

The Destruction of Babylon, the great Whore, prophesied of, Rev. 16. 16. chapter
18. 2, 3, etc. chapter 19. 2, 3.

Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt, etc. Deuteronomy. 7. 17, 18. chapter 24. 9. Matthew. 16. 8, 9.

Thou shall consider in thine heart, that as a man chasteneth, etc. so the
Lord, etc. remember, etc. Deuteronomy. 8. 5, 17, 18.

Therefore shall ye lay up all these my words in your heart, and in your soul,

are our gods, Isa. 42. 8, 17.

They who make graven-images, are all of them vanity, etc. they see not, nor
know, that they may be ashamed. Who has formed a god, or molten a
graven-image, which is profitable for nothing? Behold, all his fellows shall be
ashamed: and the workmen, etc. they shall be ashamed together, etc. The
Carpenter, etc. heweth down cedars, etc. he will take thereof, and warm
himself: yea, he kindles it, and baketh bread: yea, he makes a god, and
worshippeth it: he makes it a graven-image, and falls down thereto: he
burns part thereof in fire, etc. and the residue thereof he makes a god, his
graven-image; he falls down and worshippeth it, ^and prays unto it, and
says, Deliver me, for thou art my God, etc. None considers in his heart;
neither is there knowledge or understanding to say, I have burnt part of it in
the fire, etc. and shall I make the residue thereof an abomination? Shall I
fall down to the stock of ( or, that which comes from) a tree, Isa. 44. 9, to
20.

They shall be ashamed, and also confounded, all of them: they shall go to
confusion together, who are makers of idols, etc. They have no knowledge who
set up the wood of their graven-image; and pray unto a god, who cannot save,
Isa. 45. 16, 20.

To whom will ye liken me? etc. They lavish gold out of the bag, etc. hire a
goldsmith, and he makes it a god; and they fall down, yea, they worship: they
bear him upon the shoulder; they carry him, and set him in his place; and he
stands, etc. Yea, one shall cry to him; yet can he not answer, nor save him
out of his trouble, Isa. 46, 5, 6, 7.

I have even from the beginning declared, etc. lest thou should say, Mine
idol has done them: and my graven-image, and my molten-image has commanded
them, Isa. 48. 5.

A people who provoke me to anger continually to my face: who sacrifices in
gardens, and burns incense upon altars of brick, etc. Isa. 65. 3, 4. Jer. 1.
16.

Has a nation changed their gods, which are yet no gods? But my people have
changed their glory, for that which does not profit, etc. The house of Israel
ashamed, etc. saying to a stock, Thou art my father: And to a stone, Thou have
brought me forth, etc. But where are thy gods, which thou have made thee? Let
them arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble: for according to
the number of thy cities, are thy gods, O Judah, Jer. 2. 10, 11, 26, 27, 28.
chapter 11. 12, 13.

Israel is gone up upon every high mountain, and under every green tree; and
there plays the harlot, etc. Her treacherous sister Judah feared not, but
went and played the harlot also, etc. committed adultery with stones, and with
stocks, Jer. 3. 6, 8, 9.

See thou what they do in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of
Jerusalem? The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle a fire; and the
women knead their dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out
drink offerings unto other gods, that they may provoke me to anger, Jer. 7. 17,
18.

One cutteth a tree, etc. they are fastened with nails; they speak not, etc. be
not afraid of them, for they can do neither evil nor good, etc. They are
altogether brutish, and foolish: The stock is a doctrine of vanities, silver
spread into plate, etc. but the Lord is the true God, etc. The gods who have
not made the heavens and the earth, they shall perish from the earth, and from
under these heavens, etc. Every founder is confounded by the graven-image; for
his molten-image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them: they are vanity,
and the work of errors, Jer. 10. 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15.

Are there any among the vanities of the Gentiles that can cause rain? Jer. 14.
22.

The Gentiles shall come, etc. and say, Surely our fathers have inh^ri^^d lies,
vanity, and things wherein is no profit: Shall a man make gods unto himself,
and they are no gods? Jer. 16. 19, 20.

Then all the men who knew that their wives had burnt incense unto other gods,
and all the women who stood by, etc. answered Jeremiah, saying, etc. We will
certainly do whatsoever thing goes forth out of our own mouth, to burn incense
unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, as we have
done, we and our fathers, our kings and our princes, in the cities of Judah,
and in the streets of Jerusalem: for then had we plenty, etc. So the Lord could
no longer bear, etc. Jer. 44. 15, to 22.

I am broken with their whorish heart which have departed from me; and with
their eyes, which go a whoring after their idols, etc. Ezekiel. 6. 9.

These men have set up their idols in their hearts, and put the stumbling block
of their iniquity before their race: Should I be enquired of at all by them?
etc. I the Lord will answer him according to the multitude of his idols, etc. I
the Lord will answer him by my self, Ezekiel. 14. 1, 4, 5, 6, 7. Hosea 2. 2, 3, 4.

The insatiable Idolatry of Jerusalem, with all Nations, Ezekiel. 16. 15, 16, etc.

heathen; because thou art polluted with their idols, Ezekiel. 23. 30. chapter 16. 36,

the spirit of whoredems have caused them to err, and they have gone a whoring
from under their God: they sacrifice upon the top of mountains, and burn
incense upon the hills, under oaks, etc. Ephraim is joined to idols, let him
alone, Hosea 4. 12, 13, 17.

Of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut
off. Thy calf, O Samaria, has cast thee off: mine anger is kindled, etc. The
work man made it, therefore it is not God: but the cal^ of Samaria shall be
broken in pieces, for they have fown the wind, Hosea 8. 4, 5, 6, 7.

According to the multitude of his fruit, he has increased the altars:
according unto the goodness of his land, they have made goodly images: their
heart is divided; now they shall be found faulty: he shall break down their
altars; he shall spoil their images, Hosea 10. 1, 2.

And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten-images of their
silver, and idols according to their own understanding; all of it the work of
the crafts-men: They say of them, Let the men who sacrifice, kiss the calves:
Therefore they shall be as the morning-cloud, etc. Hosea 13. 2, 3.

I will cut off them who worship the host of heaven, etc. swear by the Lord,
and swear by Malcham, Zeph. 1. 4, 5. Amos 8. 14.

For their idols have spoken vanity, and the Diviners have seen a lie, and have
told false dreams, etc. Zech. 10. 2.

The people said, etc. the gods are come down unto us, in the likeness of men:
And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because he was the
chief speaker. Then the priest of Jupiter, etc. brought oxen and garlands unto
the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the people: which when the
Apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they rent their clothes, and ran in
among the people, crying out, and saying, Sirs, What do ye in these things? We
are also men of like passions with you; and preach unto you, that ye should
turn from these vanities, unto the living God, who made heaven and earth, etc.
Acts 14. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18.

We write unto them, that they stay from the pollutions of idols, Acts 15. 20,
29.

Paul, etc. at Athens, his spirit was stirred within him, when he saw the city
wholly given to idolatry, ( or, full of idols:) therefore disputed he in the
Synagogue, etc. Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too
superstitious: for, as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, ( or, gods whom
ye worship,) I found an altar with this Inscription, To the unknown God. Whom
therefore ye ignorantly worship, etc. Forasmuch then as we are the offspring
of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or
stone, graven by art, or man's device, Acts 17. 16, 17, 22, 23, 29.

world worshippeth, etc. Great is Diana of the Ephesians, etc. The Image which
fell down from Jupiter, Acts 19. 26, 27, 28, 34, 35.

When they knew God, they glorified him not as God, etc. but became vain in
their imaginations, etc. and changed the glory of the invisible God, into an

God into a lie; and worshipped and served the creature, more than the Creator,
Romans 1. 21, 23, 25. chapter 2. 22. Psalm. 106. 19, 20, 21.

Thou who abhorrest idols, do thou commit sacrilege? Romans 2. 22.

We know that an idol is nothing in the world; and that there is none other God
but one: for though there be that are called gods, (whether in heaven or
earth,) as there be gods many, and lords many; but to us there is but one God,
etc. 1 Cor. 8. 4, 5, 6.

Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them: As it is written, the people
sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play, etc. My dearly beloved, flee
from idolatry, etc. What say I then, that the idol is any thing? or that which
is offered in sacrifice is any thing? But I say, That the things which the
Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifie to devils, and not to God: and I would not
that ye should have fellowship with devils, 1 Cor. 10. 7, 14, 19, 20.

Of the Kings of Israel and Judah: How they came to their Power and Office.
GIdeon has judged Israel: he had seventy sons. Abimilech one of the sons of
Gideon by his servant (by subtilty with the men of Shechem, that it was better
one should reign than all the seventy sons), procures money, hires vain and
light persons, and kills all his brethren (except Jotham the youngest, who hid
himself). Abimelech by the men of Shechem and the house of Millo, made King.
After a few years he was slain by a piece of millstone a woman threw down on
him: after whom Judges governed a l^ng time, till Samuel, Judges 9.

Israel by the Elders came to Samuel, and said, Make us a king to judge us l^ke
all the nations: and though God was displeased at it, and said, They had
rejected not Samuel, but God himself, that he should not reign over them: yet
he bids Samuel hearken unto them, and make them a king, 1 Samuel 8.

Samuel, before Saul came, was told of God of his coming: and that he should be
the man whom he should anoint king. Samuel anoints him king ^ccordingly, 1 Samuel
9. chapter 10.

According to this afterward, all the people went to Gilgal: and here they
made Saul king before the Lord, 1 Samuel 11. 14, 15.

Samuel said to Saul, When thou wast little in thine own fight, wast thou not
made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the Lord anointed thee king over
Israel, etc.? Because thou have rejected the word of the Lord, he has rejected
thee from being king, 1 Samuel 15. 17, 23.

Samuel, by Gods special direction, anointed David the son of Jesse to be king
(although Saul was yet living): and the spirit left Saul, and came upon David,
1 Samuel 16. 1, 12, 13, 14.

And after Saul's death, the men of Judah came to Hebron, and there they
anointed David king over Judah: but Abner made Ishbosheth the son of Saul king
over all Israel, 2 Samuel 2. 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9.

After the death of Ishbosheth (being slain), came all the tribes of Israel to
David unto Hebron, etc. And all the Elders of Israel came, etc. and king David

out of the hands of Solomon's son, and give ten tribes unto him: Solomon died,

All Israel came to Shethem to make Rehoboam king; the people proposing ease,
and Rehoboam refusing to grant it, (the cause was from the Lord, that he might
perform what he had said), ten tribes fell off from him. And when all Israel
had heard that Jeroboam was come again, they sent and called him to the
Congregation, and made him king over all Israel. When Rehoboam intended by
force to reduce them, God forbid it, and said, This thing is from me: only
Judah subjected to Rehoboam, 1 Kings 12. 1, 7, 3, 4, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20,
21, 22, 23, 24.

away the posterity of Baasha, etc. Baasha died, Elah his son reigned in his
stead. Zimri, one of Elah his servants, conspired against him, and smote him,
and killed him, and reigned in his stead over Israel. But when Israel being in

faith the Lord God of Israel, I have anointed thee king over the people of the
Lord, even over Israel: and thou shall smite the house of Ahab thy master, that
I may avenge, etc. Then the army proclaimed him king: then Jehu killed Jehoram
king of Israel, etc. and also Ahaziah the king of Judah was slain by Jehu, 2
Kings 9. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 13, 14, 24, 27.

And the Lord said unto Jehu, Because thou have done well in executing that
which was right in mine eyes: and have done unto the house of Ahab according
unto all which was in my heart, thy children of the fourth generation shall sit
on the throne of Israel. Jehu died, and Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead,
over Israel, 2 Kings 10. 30, 35.

Israel's Murmurings against God and Moses, when God was in his Way of
Redeeming them.
WHen Moses and Aaron had been with Pharaoh, and Pharaoh had made their burden
heavier, they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way as they came forth from
Pharaoh; and they said unto them, The Lord look upon you, and judge; because
you have made our favor to be abhorred ( or, to stink) in the eyes of Pharaoh,
and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword into their hands, to slay us,
Exodus 5. 1, 2, 6, 7, 20, 21.

When they were pursued by the Egyptians, they cried unto the Lord: and they
said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, have thou taken us
away, to die in the wilderness? Wherefore have thou dealt thus with us, to
carry us forth out of Egypt? Is not this the word that we did tell thee in
Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it had been
better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the
wilderness, Exodus 14. 8, to 13.

the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink? Exodus 15. 23,

by the hand of the Lord, in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the fleshpots,

wilderness, to kill this whole congregation with hunger, etc. Ye shall see the
glory of the Lord, for that he hears your murmurings against the Lord: And
what are we, that ye murmur against us? etc. Your murmurings are not against
us, but against the Lord, Exodus 16. 2, 3, 7, 8, 12.

The people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us water, that we may drink.
And Moses said to them, Why chide you with me? wherefore do you tempt the Lord?
And the people thirsted there for water: and the people murmured against Moses,
and said, Wherefore is this, that thou have brought us up out of Egypt, to kill
us, and our children, and our cattle with thirst? etc. They tempted the Lord,
saying, Is the Lord among us, or not? Exodus 17. 2, 3, 7.

and the fire of the Lord burnt, etc. And the mixed multitude who was among them

did eat in Egypt freely: the cucumbers, and the melons, etc. but now our soul
is dried away: there is nothing at all, besides this Manna, before our eyes,
etc. God gave them flesh: but while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere
it was chewed, the wrath of the Lord was kindled against the people; and the
Lord smote the people with a very great plague, etc. Numb. 11. 1, 4, 5, 6, 10,

land of Egypt; or, Would God we had died in this wilderness. And wherefore has
the Lord brought us unto this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and
our children should be a prey? Were it not better for us to return into Egypt?

in the wilderness, etc. These men, who saw my glory, and my signs, have tempted

Moses, and against Aaron: and the people chod with Moses, and spoke, saying,
Would God we had died when our brethren died before the Lord. And why have ye
brought up the congregation of the Lord into this wilderness? that we and our
cattle should die there! And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt,
to bring us into this evil place? It is no place of seed, or of figs or vines,
etc. Numb. 20. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

people spoke against God, and against Moses: Wherefore have ye brought us up

cloud, etc. but with many of them God was not well pleased, for they were
overthrown in the wilderness. Now these things were our examples, to the intent
that we should not lust after evil things, as they also lasted, etc. Neither
let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed of
serpents. Neither murmur ye, as some or them also murmured, and were destroyed
by the destroyer. Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples, ( or
types,) and are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are
come: therefore let him who thinks he stands, take heed lest he fall, 1

Of Man's Ignorance of the Men and Things of this World, after his Departure

THou destroyest the hope of man: thou prevailest for ever against him, and he
