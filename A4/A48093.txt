A LETTER FROM THE Noblemen, Gentlemen, Justices, and Freeholders of the Shire
of Fife, to the Lord General Monck.
With his Lordships Answer thereunto.
May it please your Lordship,
BY the call of your Letter, of the fifteenth of November last, We Noblemen,
Gentlemen, Justices and Freeholders of the Shre of Fife and Kinrosse, having
met, and taking into our serious consideration the tenor and import thereof,
both as to the grounds of your present undertaking, and the expressions of your
favor and tenderness toward the Peace, Safety and Help of this (even
burdened and) afflicted Nation. We hold it a duty incumbent upon us, humbly to
represent your Lordship with this return. In the first place, we conceive our
selves bound to pay our thankful acknowledgments of those many and great
obligements you have put upon us; for the regard you have expressed of those
crushing pressures which we have so long and visibly labored under; and your
care and readiness to interpose to ease the languishing (and now utterly
expiring) condition of this poor Country, which cries out for relief. Next,
as we look upon it as a token for good, that the merciful God who can plead
the cause of the oppressed, has stirred your Lordship in this day of desperate
extremity, to stand in the breach, to avert that impendent ruin of all that is
precious, by asserting the Liberty and being of Parliaments, according to our
ancient Constitutions, and a Godly Ministry, wherein our freedom and Rights
(Religious and Civil) are bound up jointly with the Interest of England and
Ireland; So we judge it to be the duty of all, as they are true-hearted
Patriots and Christians, and hear a due sense of their concernments in the weal
or woe of public Transactions, to own the Prosecution of those mentioned Ends,
as the only effectual Expedient, distinctly considerable beyond any other, for
the lightning of the Evils we now feel, and prevention of those we fear, by
^ling the Government and Authourity, which may rule in the hearts of men by
Love and Righteousness, and not Tyrannize over their Persons and Estates by
Force and Power. For our parts, we have been spectators with sad bleeding
hearts of the grievous breaches, which by the Revolutions of late years have
been made upon these Nations: And among all the pretenders to our Cause, we
have found no healing Medicines, nor can we expect that our suffering wounds
can be healed, and wasting divisions closed by an Unparliamentary unchoe way.
The Gospel and the Interest of Jesus Christ should be (and we hope shall be)
dearer to us than our lives, which we are sure cannot be preserved and
maintained without a Godly and learned Ministry; our other concernments we must
w^ve in these places, (The great preserver of men, who loves and delights in
righteous things, is the LORD alone, upon whom we do fix our eyes) but
according to what comes within the compass of humane consideration, and the
knowledge we might have acquired by dear-bought experience, when these personal
and public Interests, solemnly owned, may be best secured; So we do most
unanimously bear our Testimony to the Equity and Justice of these Grounds you
have professed; That we know, we can willingly own no safer nor better means
for restoring and preserving of all our dearest concernments, than by a
Parliament, sitting in safety and honor, without any force or interruption,
and capacitated for application of such comprehensive Remedies, as may reach
the universal public Maladies, and Distempers, and Persons, and proc^re the
private benefit of signal men, and several parties, how considerable soever,
only so far as they advance the general Interest and public good of the
Commonwealth. When we reflect upon the uncertain, torn, disjoynted and
tottering condition we are cast into by an Arbitrary Government, and the
distracting Terrors, dismal Confusions, necessitated Rui^es desolating
Exactions, which sad experience does prove to be the usual attendants of a
Sword-Power; so that when it takes the Helm, then neither is, nor can be, the
lest hope of settled assurance of Life, Estate, Property, or any matter or
thing whatsoever, but all must be contented in a reeling fluctuating estate,
which at the long-run may prove destructive, even to those who promise to
themselves greatest immunity; therefore if we shall express the belief and
p^eservation of our hearts and souls, we must profess undoubtedly that we see
not how this Island can have Remedy, Cure, and Deliverance, and Settlement to
the satisfaction and content of sober men, till Parliaments be restored to
their honor, freedom and safety, and we cannot be answerable to those
Dictates, which Reason, Interest, and Duty and Engagements promp unto us, if we
do not unanimously concur and lay our selves forth in our stations for
promoting and advancing this fi^m and sure settling way of a lasting Peace and
Happiness; in pursuance whereof, we do purpose and resolve by the help of God
to preserve the peace and safety of this Country as we can, to give all
countenance and encouragement to the godly Ministry, and faithful in the Land,
and so to dispose of our selves as we may attend your Lordships dir^ctions, and
yield all due respects to your Commands from time to time, making our
supplication, that the Supreme D^sposer of all things, and the great GOD of
Peace may put into the hearts of those who are now upon the Stage of Action, to
improve their utmost interest and power for the preventing the effusion of
blood, and incline them to pursue the just ways of peace and firm Settlement
so much desired and longed for, whic may be obtained with safety enough on all
sides, and indemnity to all persons; the speedier and cheerful accomplishment
whereof, we do verily believe is in the hearts and thirstings of all good
people, save such who mind fears, jealousies, prejudices and advantages, more
then the Common-good and Publick-safety, and care not though all pe^ish and
sink, so they may but keep themselves aloft, and swimming. We beg your
Lordships pardon, that we have taken the liberty thus to express our Sense,
Fears Desires and Purposes, relating to the Affairs now in hand, and shall add
no more, but that the only wise good GOD (if he has yet such a Mercy for us
they make you a renowned Instrument for restoring three populous Nations after
a long tedious storm, to that calm and felicity of Peacen a Settlement, to be
transmitted and derived to our Posterities, that your fame and just praise for
so noble and glorious Achievement may sound far and near, and never endingly
continue.

Thus Prays, Your Lordships most humble and faithful Servants.

For the Right Honorable, my Lord General Monck These.
General Monck's Answer.
My Lords and Gentlemen,
I Received your Letter, and return you thanks for the large testimony of your
Fidelity to the Commonwealth, and your good Affections to that Good Cause, in
which we are now engaged; And do hereby assure you, that it shall be amongst
the chiefest of my Cares, to preserve you in peace and prosperity, and to
defend and and protect you from all dangers especially such as you may incur,
by this your honest and cheerful expression of your well-wishes toward us:
And to that end, I do Empower and Authorize the Noblemen, Gentlemen and
Justices of Peace of your Counties, or any nine of them, with the Advice and
consent of the Governor of the next adjacent Garrison, to put in execution
such Orders and Commands as I shall have occasion to give, for securing the
Peace of the Country; provided, the Noblemen, Gentlemen, and Justices be such
as have subscribed to live peaceably, and to act nothing prejudicial to the
Commonwealth of England; and that none of them be Papists: and I do allow, that
such Noblemen and Gentlemen as have subscribed the Letter as aforesaid, shall
have liberty (with Passes from me) to wear their Arms, and four Servants to be
likewise armed, for the attendance of each Nobleman, and two for each
Gentleman: and as you know of any other thing wherein I may be serviceable to
you, I shall desire you to propound, with assurance of the utmost endeavors
and furtherance of

Berwick Dec. 14. 1659. Your Lordships very humble Servant GEORGE MONCK.
