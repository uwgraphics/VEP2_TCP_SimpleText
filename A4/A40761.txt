A few Lines given forth, and a true Testimony of the way which is Christ, whom
the Saints enjoyes who have believed in the light, and followed it into the
Regeneration, which they come to know through the preaching of the Gospel,
which has been received in the Power of God in these latter days, and has
been preached in the Demonstration of the Spirit.
IN love to all who have desires in them to know the truth as it is in Jesus,
that they may forsake their fallen wisdom, which for many years they have had
in possession, yet by it cannot come to know the Lord, nor his way, but are in
the dark, though the light of the glorious Gospel has long shined among them,
and the day of the Lord has appeared, which is it that gives the knowledge of
God, and his way; even the Grace of God which has appeared unto all men.

Now all people, both Professors and profane is to mind the fear of the Lord,
for the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; and by this wisdom which
is learnt in the fear of the Lord, by it you come to know the power of God in
the light, and as you believe in it, you believe in that which is able to the
utmost to save all that comes unto it, so as you wait and feel the power dwell
with it, that you may witness its workings in you, to the destroying of the
power of sin; For while it is ruling in you, you are led captive by the devil,
and all who comes not to confess, and own the light, which is the power of God
in them, cannot be freed from it, but as any comes to the light, which
discovers sin; that is it which gives power over sin, and dwelling in the
light, you dwell in that which never consented unto sin, the true and faithful
witness of God, which bears witness in every particular against evil; so
loving this, and obeying this, to forsake sin as it discovers it, so you will
come to have power and dominion over sin, through the power of God, and as you
love the light, and dwell in it, you will know another to take the kingdom in
you, which is able to cast out the devil, and destroy all his works; but who
comes not to the light, comes not to Christ, and are in the reprobate state,
without God in the world, alienated from the Commonwealth of Israel. But who
comes to the light, and believes in it, to be guided by it, receiving it, they
receive Christ the Mediator of the New Covenant, unto all that are sanctified,
in whom the Lord is reconciling the world unto himself by the blood of the Lamb
which is shed for many; so all people must come to that which shows them the
evil of their way, and turn from it unto that which discovers it unto you,
which is Christ the light in every one of you, for that which makes manifest is
light, and the light is Christ. I am the light of the world, says Christ,
which lightneth every one that comes into the world, which whosoever
receives, they receive the wisdom and power of God; Him whom God has given
for salvation unto the ends of the earth, whose name is called the word of God,
Christ the light, his Name is called the Word of God, so that is it which all
people is to believe in, the light, and in it to walk as children of the light,
putting off the deeds of darkness, and to follow the light in all
righteousness and holiness, having a conversation void of offense toward
God, and toward men; so all people coming to believe in the light, and
following it, they come to that which saves the soul, and receives him who is
Gods salvation; and every particular which comes to the Light, comes to Christ
the seed of God, who is heir of the kingdom which has no end but endures for
ever; and who are obedient to the light, it gives power over sin, and that is
it in all, which never consented unto sin, but is a swift witness against all
sin, when it is but conceived in the heart, before it be acted; it shows the
creature that it is evil: so who believes in that which makes manifest, and
forsakes the sin, shall find mercy. Therefore all people which lives in sin,
fulfilling the desires of your evil hearts; Repent and fear the Lord, and come
to the light, which will cleanse and purify your hearts, and turn you from the
evil of your ways, and keep to that which checks and reproves you, it will
bring all your sins before you which you have acted, and them you do now act,
and it will bring condemnation and judgment upon you for them, and this is
Christ the light, the condemnation of the world, the light with which every one
is enlightened that comes into the world, which would show every one the way
he is in; For says Christ, I am the light of the world, and lightneth every
one that comes into the world; so every one being enlightened with the true
light, with Christ, who is the way, the truth, and the life; every one has the
light, believe in the light, that ye may be children of the light; that which
makes manifest is light, which light is Christ the Son of God, which reveals
the Father, for none knows the Father, save the Son, and he to whom the Son
reveals him, whom to know is life eternal; and this life is the life of the
Son of God, whom God has given for salvation, that whosoever believes in him
might not perish, but have eternal life; And blessed are all who have believed,
and received it in the love of it, and abide in it, those are saved by it, and
such have the blessing of the Lord with them, they have the seed, which seed is
Christ the heir of salvation, who saves his people from their sin, and leads
them from under the powers of darkness of this world into his mavelous
light, and to a kingdom which has no end; And Christ the light he becomes
their guide and leader, and in all truth they are led, and great is their
peace, and such cannot go into sin, who are guided by the light, for that never
consents unto sin; but who so commits sin, is not with the light guided into
it: For sin is of the devil, and he is the Father of it. For they which follow
the light, comes to be born of God an incorruptible seed, and he that is born
of God sins not, because the seed abides in him, which seed is Christ, whom
Satan has no part in; so all people which knows not the way to the one true
way which leads to life, which is a straight and narrow way, they must come to
the light, and take up the daily Cross; for he that will be Christ's Disciple,
must take up his Cross and follow him the light; Christ he is the way, the
truth, and the life; and the Gospel has been preached unto nations and people,
the sound has gone forth, but who has believed the report, unto such is the
Arm of the Lord revealed.
