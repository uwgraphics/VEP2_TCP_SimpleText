FORCED UNIFORMITY NEITHER CHRISTIAN nor PRVDENT.
Presented To those in AUTHORITY whom it may concern.
FRiends, I have had some ferrous Considerations upon my Hear: to present to
you, signifying how that an Uniformity in Matters of Worship could not be in
any or most of the Ages of the World, gained and maintained, effected or
established, and how that the Nations of the Earth have been upon Heaps about
it; and in most Ages the best Sort of Men have been Sufferers in Things
appertaining to Conscience, because their Number has been in all (or most
Ages) but small in Comparison of the vain Multitude; and my Design here is, to
show or signify to you, that in most, or all Ages, there have been Divisions
in the Earth about Religion from the very first to this Day, and this Thing
called Uniformity, that Rulers of Nations have been striving about for some
Hundreds, or as I may say, some Thousands of Years, is uneffected to this
present Day, notwithstanding as much Force and Violence has been used, as well
as you or any People else can devise or invent to make Use of to effect this
Work: So I desire you may for the Nations Good consider of these Things; for
this be assured of, I write not these Things unto you because we faint in
Suffering, or grow weary of what we have taken in Hand by the constraining
Power of our God, whose Presence is better to us then Life it self; but I
assuredly know, there are many hundreds had rather part with Life it self, and
all they have, then faint or grow weary in suffering for Christ's sake, who
has been so good and faithful a God unto them in the midst of many deep
Sufferings; and I am satisfied, he that has kept us hitherto will keep us to
the End, whatever we endure for his Names sake; for we have learned to forgive
our Enemies, and do Good to them that do Evil to us, and therefore do desire
your Souls Good as our own, knowing that our God has called to you by the
Spirit of his Son Christ, in your Consciences, that he might deliver your Souls
from Hell, and front the Horrible Pit, if you will but learn of him, and
hearken to the Call of Christ, the true Light, Joh. 1.9. And so to him that
searches the Heart, and tries the Reins, and sees every secret Thought, and is
as a shining Light in your Hearts, many a Time, to give you to discern betwixt
that which is good and evil, do I recoommend what here I have written.

HAving viewed many Laws by you made about Matters of Religion and Worship, and
also having cast my Eye backward into the Ages past, I do find that many
Endeavors have been on Foot, and many Laws made by diverse and sundry Rulers of
Nations and People, both Eccl^siastical and Temporal so called, to force Men to
an Uniformity in Matters of Religion and Worship, for many hundreds of Years
past and gone; and the Nations, and several of the Professors of the diverse
Sorts of Worshippers have been over and over again involved in Blood and War,
through Ages and Generations, that it would make ones Heart bleed within him,
to consider the Cruelty, Murder and Bloodshed that has ensued in the Nations
upon those Accounts; one while one Sort of Religion upermost, and then another;
and he that has got upermost for the most Part has been endeavoring to force
all to his Opinion or Persuasion by Cruelty and Oppression, that truly to write
to you upon this Subject, I could rather spend my Time in weeping and mourning
for what has hapen'd in the Earth (and Religion has been mostly the Pretense)
then d^p my Pen in such a Tragedy of bloody Actions and un-christian like
Doings: And this Evil Spirit that has entered the World, the Devil; the old
Adversary of Man's Happiness has been as a Mystery of Iniquity working in the
World, and putting People and Nations upon, to destroy one another, and the
Properties and Rights of one another, and break the Holy Law of God, which
says, Do as thou would be done by, from the Days of Persecuting Cain and
Righteous Abel to this our Day and Time; for Cain he destroyed his Brother
Abel, the second Birth, because be was found differing in Worship, and in that
in which he was accepted of God, and Cain was not, and therefore Cain was
wroth, and slew his Righteous Brother Abel, though there was a Time when God
would have had him to have done well, and said, If thou do well, shall thou
not be accepted? but if thou do Evil, Genesis 4.6, 7.
Sin lies at thy Door; and God said unto him, Why art thou wroth? why is thy
Countenance fallen? so I desire, consider God's Love and Patience to Cain: but
Cain instead of doing well, broke God's Holy Law, and did not do as he would
have been done by, and at the Instigation of the Devil, slew his Brother, for
which you may read God's Curse came upon him. And in those Ages of the World;
both good Men and bad Men were found Worshippers of a God, but it was mostly
the good Men that suffered by bad Men, and the Righteous Worshipper by the
Unrighteous; and how had all Flesh corrupted its Ways in the Days of
Righteous Noah, who was a Preacher of Righteousness, not only in Words, but
Life and Conversation; and their Violence and Wickedness was so great, that God
said, It repented him that he had made Man? And after those Days, Genesis 6.6.
there was Righteous Abraham, Lot and Melchizedeck, Worshippers of the most
High God; but there was the Cursed Stock of Ham in those Days, that walked in
his Evil Ways, like the Sodomites that evilly entreated Righteous Lot and the
two Angels of God, though the Lord said to Abraham, he would not have destroyed
it if there had been found in her but Ten Righteous Persons: And in the very
Family of Isaac, there was Esau, a vain Man, Genesis 18.32.
not accepted of God, though once the Birthright was in him; but Jacob was an
honest, sober, plain man, and therefore God accepted of him and blessed him: And
what Laws were made, or how did the Kings of Israel labor to force those that
dissented from them, is plainly manifest in the Books of their Chronicles,
Kings and Prophets; but it was mostly the Holy Men and Prophets that suffered;
for they durst not deny their God, and join with the false Worships of their
Nation, but were so Conscientious, that they ventured Life and all; so that the
Prophet Elijah complained in his Day, That they had thrown down God's Altars,
and slain his Children or Prophets, and he only was escaped; 1 Kings 19.10.
so that grievous Persecution was in the World in those Days about Religion,
and when the Assyrians besieged Samaria, how did the then King of Israel
Threaten to take off the Head of the good Prophet Elisha; he was so blind that
he thought the Prophet was Occasion of this Evil that hapen'd to them, when it
was their own Wickedness and Persecuting Evil Spirits that broke God's Holy
Law, and did not do as they would have been done by: but I shall sum up the
Substance of all their Wickedness, in Evilly entreating God's Messengers and
Prophets, with the Saying of Christ Jesus, saying, He had sent unto them
Prophets and Wise Men, some of them they had slain, and crucified, and Scourged
in their Synagogues, and persecuted them from City to City, that upon you may
come all the Righteous Blood shed upon the Earth, Mat. 23.34, 35.
from the Blood of Righteous Abel to Zacharias the Son of Barachias, whom you
slew betwixt the Temple and the Altar: How had these Children or People of
Israel been blinded with a Spirit of Persecution? for sure, if ever they had
considered with themselves, that they did not do as they would be done by, that
is to say, giving the same Liberties that they would have had others to have
given to them, if the other had gotten up into Authority over them, then one
would not have per^ecuted and killed another: And how were those blind Jews
carried on with a blind persecrting Zeal, garnishing the Sepulchers of the
Prophets whom their Fathers slew, and making long Prayers, and walking in long
Robes, and making clean the Outside of the Cup, though the Inside be full of
Rotteness and all this Mischief was done to God's Servants under a formal or
band Zeal by a professing Sort of People in those Ages, who were so blinded by
this evil, wicked Spirit, that from Abel to this Day hurries People on in a
blind Zeal, every Man for his own Way, in such a Fierceness, that one Sort of
People has been making War upon another, persecuting and killing one another
about Religion; so that in most Ages God has had but a very small Remnant that
has kept the Righteous Law of God, and done as they would another should do to
them, and loved their Neighbors as themselves. And the Devil, the old Enemy of
Mankind, which blined Cain, and then made him slay his Righteous Brother, has
from Age to Age transformed himself into most Sects and Opinions of People, and
under Petence of Zeal for Religion, when he has blinded their Eyes with
Conceit of the Righteousness of their own Ways, has put them on in an Eager
Zeal, or for some Outward Interest or other that he has suggested into their
Hearts, to force all Men to their Way, or to an Uniformity of Worship, though
to the utter Ruin of the Lives, Estates, Properties and Rights of Hundreds and
many Thousands in the Ages gone; and this evil Spirit has with these Coverings
been at work, both amongst Jews and Gentiles, and one might fill a large Volumn
with the bloody Tragedies of this Evil One: I need not instance the Plurality
of the Heathen Gods, and the Division amongst them, and the killing of one
another about the setting up of their Idol-Worships amongst them, here being
too much of this Nature done amongst the dark Worshippers (as they pretend) of
the true God, who have only got the outside Form, but want the Power, and have
many of them (as had the Jews, as Paul said) a Zeal, but want the true
Understanding and godly Charity, which leads to do as one would another should
do to him, and love their Neighbors as themselves, and endeavor the
Preservation of one another, both in Life, Estate, Rights and Property.

And truly, whilst the State of the World stands as it does, we cannot expect
but there will be Division, as always there has been since Transgression
entered both false Worshippers of diverse Sorts; and true Worshippers; and the
truly godly and sober Men are but a very small Number, as Christ said, Strait
is the Gate that leads to Life, and few there be that en^ers therein: And many
Divisions there were after the Apostles Time, and some in their Days; My
Brethren, says he, You have heard that Antichrists will come, nay, says he,
they are even come already; and Christ says, They will come in Sheeps
Clothing, but they shall be known by their Fruit, inwardly Ravening Wolves,
seeking their Gain from their Quarters; and John said, They were gone forth
into the World in his Day, 1 John 4.1.
and so their Works do manifest them: They are Breakers of Christ's Royal Law,
which says, Love thy Neighbor as thy self; and they are inwardly Ravening
Wolves, whose Belly is their God, who seek their Gain from their Quarters, and
like to the false Prophets of old, and formal Professors of the Law, put on
Kings and Rulers to destroy Men in Life, Estate and Property, who will not, and
also those who dare not for Conscience sake join with their dead Forms,
whatever they suffer for refusing.

And I desire you, consider what Laws can either you or any Men make that have
not been made; look but through the History of Times in Italy, Germany, France,
England, Scotland and Ireland, etc. and the said Effects of those Laws, mostly
pretending to force People to an Uniformity of Worship, and all has been in
vain: I desire you, consider J. Fox's Acts and Monuments, and the Tragical
History of those Ages within these sixteen hundred Years; How violently did the
Romans endeavor to crush down the spreading of the Gospel, that he says in
his Epistle Dedicatory to Q. Elizabeth, that when the Records were searched,
there was martyred for every Day in the Year, within the Compass of those ten
bloody Persecutions fifty THOUSAND Persons, One Day only excepted; and the more
they strove with their Cruelty to force Men's Consciences, and to bring Men to
one Form as it were, or to their Worship, the wider and wider was the Breach,
and they were never able to effect what they intended. And great Division there
was in those Ages for the first six hundred Years, that it would be too tedious
to mention them; for I desire rather to refer you to Eusebius and the Grecian
Writers of those Times, how one while the Bishop of Constantinople strove for
Superiority, and another while the Bishop of Rome, though there was for the
most Part the Bishops of Jerusalem, Antioch, Alexandria and Rome, striving one
against another; and as Darkness and Apostasy got in, the Strife grew greater
and greater, till at last, six hundred Years being expired, the Bishop of Rome
usurpt over all the rest with his Tyranny, and brought the Kings and Emperors
of the Earth in Subjection to him, as does appear by the Histories of those
Times: And when he had all the Power he could desire, to make Laws, and force
Men's Consciences to an Uniformity of Worship, and the Rulers of those Nations
to be at his, and his Cardinals and Bishops Becks, to put in Execution what
they pleased, How many then suffered diverse Sorts of Cruel Torments with Fire
and Faggot, Racking, Imprisoning and Torturing, as witness the Testimonies
given by J. Fox in his aforesaid Act and Monuments, as the Wal^ienses, John
Wickliff and his Followers here in England; and the Laws that were made against
them are yet extant to be seen, and the Cruelty exercised upon those Godly Men
at a Place called Bangar near Wales, and though they burned them, confiscated
their Estates: And for all they used all the Cruelty Imaginable to suppress
those godly Men that followed John Wickliff here in England they never could
effect their Will; God preserved the honest-hearted, though they made many
Hypocrites; but the more they strove, the wider and wider grew the Breach, and
the Lord prospered the Upright in Heart, though many of them went through the
Flames of Fire, yet their faithful Sufferings reached God's Witness in Peoples
Hearts, who hated and abhorred those Dealings, and the Papists they made
themselves stinck in the Nostrils of the Commonality, until their Faithfulness
had reached those that after came into Authority, and the Romish Faction was
abhorred, and had lost their Interest in the Common People also, and so the
other came over their Heads; and after the same Manner came it to pass in
Bohemia, and Cermany, and Scotland, and diverse other Countries, by their so
vehemently striving for an Uniformity, they made themselves every where almost
ridiculous, and so lost all; and to relate the many and diverse Sorts of Cruel
Laws that were made to effect this, would be too tedious at this Time: And the
most miserable suffering State of the poor oppressed conscientious People, how
they were Racked, Torn, Burned, and Whipped, and Starved in nasty Prisons,
destroyed in Life, Property, Rights, Privileges and Estates, would also
require a large Volumn to give you the Heads thereof; and what has it all
tended to, but to the provoaking God's Wrath, and heavy Indignation upon the
Heads of the Oppressors, who were blinded with Blind Zeal, and acted to do the
Drudgery and Service of the Devil, who seeks to set one Neighbor against
another, and kindle Strife and Hatred one against another with his manifold
Devices?

And truly, within the Remembrance of our Time, and in the Days of our
Fathers, what strange Ruptures have hapen'd in the Land of our Nativity, and
the chief Ground sprung from the Oppressions of Men's Conscience; each People,
as they grew up into Authority, endeavored to set up their own Way and Form of
Worship, and force others, and then those that were oppressed, bonded together to
supplam the other, and all or mostly under Religious Pretenses. Oh the most
Dreadful Bloodsheds that have hapen'd, Brother against Brother, and nigh
Kinsman against Kinsman, and Neighbor against Neighbor! And all has hapen'd
and come to pass by Men's Minds being alienated from the Spirit of God which
shines in their own Hearts, reproving them for their Evil Thoughts and Deeds,
which if it were but learned, and Men guided by it, it would lead Men to do as
they would be done by, and seek their Neighbors and Country's Good as their
own, giving to every Man as he himself would have h^mself the Free Liberty of
his Conscience, that so one Neighbor might live quietly by another.

And truly, I might have instanced many Particulars more to you, ho^
destructive to Nation and People, Trades and Employments, those Attem^ and
Undertaking have proved, of seeking to force an Uniformity in Matte^ of
Religion and Worship; but being persuaded in my self, that if it please God,
you come but to a serious Consideration of those Things, and cast your Eye
backwards into the ancient Ages of the World, to see what evil Consequences
those persecuting Actions have produced, you will be with us convinced in your
Hearts, that it is not a right Spirit that leads Men thus evilly to do to their
Neighbors, to destroy them in Life, Liberty, Property or Estate; and that they
are the Ministers of Antichrist who thus would, and all along have put on the
Magistrates to oppress and destroy their freeborn Countrymen, in Life,
Liberty, Property or Estates, and all for Matters of Conscience Sake, though
many of them are, and have been, honest, sober, temperate and godly Livers in
the midst of their Neighbors in this the Land of their Nativity; surely, they
have never considered what Christ said to his Apostles, when the Tares were
grown up amongst the Wheat, said they, shall we pull out the Tares from amongst
the Wheat? and he said, Nay, lest therewith you pull up the Wheat also: So that
if you will keep those Laws in Force that oppress us for our Consciences. I
will assure you, you will sooner, and assuredly hurt those that are honest,
godly, sober, and conscientious, and dare not for the very Holy Fear and
Reverence they bear in their Hearts to God, do that which may grieve his good
Spirit, then those that are loose, hypocritical Dissemblers both with God and
Men; for those will turn every Way to save themselves, and you will never get
hold of them, do what you can: But if you do by your Laws destroy those sober,
godly, temperate and conscientious Men, that live in the midst of your Land in
Life, Person, Estates or Property, as many hundreds have been, to the utter
Ruin of them and their Families, within these twelve years, I am satisfied, it
will provoak God's Judgments upon this our Land yet more and more: Surely, many
of you sometimes cannot but be in a Sense of the most abominable Wickednesses
that abound in this Land, and you may remember, that if there had been but ten
Righteous Persons in Sodom, God had not destroyed them, that wicked Generation
had been delivered from the Plagues and heavy Wrath of God for their sakes; but
there were not, and therefore were they destroyed; and the Lord does often
defer his Judgments from a Nation, Kindred or People, for the sake of those
that live soberly, godly and honestly in this present evil World: And this I
desire you to observe, that in all, or most Ages, great have been the
Differences amongst Men, Nations and People about Religi^n, and many, both
before Christ and since, have been persecuting and pressing to force men to an
Uniformity through diverse Ages, to that their Worship which then they had
establish^d that was uppermost, and in vain have men endeavored herein; for
the Divisions are as many, and the Rent as great as ever: And do but consider,
how can you expect to effect that which through all these Ages and Generations
is uneffected yet, notwithstanding all the violent Endeavors that hitherto
have been projected and put in Practice.

And my Souls Desire is, that you might consider how many formerly have been
and are like to be ruined in Liberty, Property and Estates, if you continue
those Laws in force: Are not the very Worst sort of Livers turned loose upon
us? and have they not the Justices of Peace at command to take away our Estates
in the sight of the Sun; or forfeit a hundred Pound, nay, notwithstanding we
have a Witness for us, both in your Consciences, and the People of the Nation,
that We are most of us Men of Honest, Sober and Temperate Lives amongst our
Neighbors in the places where we live?

And for your Good do I desire you would consider it, lest in the Hour of Death
you may have Cause to Mourn without Hope for it.

And truly, Friends and Countrymen, God knows my Heart, I desire your Souls
real Good, as my own, and that not one of you may touch the Lord's Anointed, or
do his Prophets any Harm; for he takes it as done to himself, as you may read
in Mat. 25. Though I am satisfied, there are many of you, that do not desire to
have a hand in hurting those you see live honestly and soberly, and therefore
from a true and real Love to your Souls was I drawn by the Lord, to signify
these things to you, desiring that you may mind his good Spirit, that waits,
and long has waited to show Mercy on you and shows and manifests what is Good,
and what is Evil; and leads to Do as you and we would be done by.

And in the late little Time of Liberty, freely to exercise the Liberty of
their Consciences, much quieter has the Nation been; and more comfortably has
one Neighbor lived with another, then when one Neighbor was forced at the
Information of an Informer, to spoil another in Goods, Property and Estate,
disobliging Interest and Kindreds, ruinating many sober Tenants, Tradesmen and
Freeholders. And I am persuaded, make as strict Laws amongst you as you please,
we shall never grudg you to keep the Government in your hands that are of that
Persuasion, and to constrain men to live a Godly, Sober and Temperate Life as
much as may be: For that which we desire is, only to pass quietly through our
short Pilgrimage in this World, with the free Exercise as to matter of Worship
of our Consciences. And so what I have here signified to you, I desire to
recommend to God's Holy Spirit, Joh. 1. to ver. 11.
that John, the Baptist, and John the Apostle both bore Witness of, was the
True Light, which lights every man which comes and is come into the World.
And, He came into the World, but the World received him not; but to as many as
received him, to them he gave Power to become the Sons of God. And is that Word
of Life, and Grace of God, Tit. 2.11.
which brings Salvation, and has plentifully appeared to all men.
