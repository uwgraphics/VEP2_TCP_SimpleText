The Great Boobee.
To a pleasant new Tune; Or, Salengers Round


MY Friends if you will understand
my fortunes what they are
I ever had Cattle, House and Land,
but now am never the near,
My Father left a good estate
as I may tell to thee,
I cozened was of all I had
like a great Boobee.
I went to School with a good intent,
and for to learn my book,
And all the day I went to play,
in it I never did look,
Full seven years, or very nigh,
as I may tell to thee,
I could hardly say my Christ-cross-row
like a great Boobee.
My Father then in all the hast^,
did set me to the Plow,
And for to lash the horse about,
indeed I knew not how;
My Father took his whip in his hand,
and soundly lashed me
He called me Fool and Country clown
and great Boobee.
But I did from my Wather run,
for I will plow no more,
Because he has so slashed me,
and made my side so sore*
But I will go to London Town.
some vashions for to see
When I came there they called me Clown
and great Boobee.
But as I went along the street,
I carried my hat in my hand,
And to every one that I did meet,
I bravely bust my hand;
Some did laugh, and some did scoff,
and some did mock at me,
And some did say I was a Woodcock,
and a great Boobee.
Then did I walk in haste to Paul's,
the Steeple for in view
Because I heard some people say,
it should be builded new,
Then I got up unto the top,
the City for to see,
It was so high it made me cry
like a great Boobee.
From thence I went to Westminst^^
and for to see the Tombs,
Oh, said I, what a house is here
with an infinite sight of Room*
Sweetly the Abbey Bells did ring
it was a fine zight to see,
Me thought I was going to heaven in a st^^^^
like a great Boobee.
The second part,
To the same Tune


But as I went along the street,
the most part of the day
Many Gallants did I meet
me thoughts they were very gay,
I blew my nose, and pist my hose
some people did me see,
They said I was a beastly fool,
and a great Boobee.
^ext day I through P^e-corner past,
Roast-meat on the stall
Invited me to take a taste
my money was but small
The meat I picked, the Cook me kicked
as I may tell to thee
He beat me zore, and made me rore
like a great Boobee.
As I through Smithfield lately walked
a gallant Lass I met
Familiarly with me she talked
which I cannot forget,
She proffered me a pint of wine
me thought she was wondrous free,
To the Tavern then I went with her
like a great Boobee.
She told me we were near of kin,
and called for wine good store,
Before the reckoning was brought in
my Cousin proved a Whore
My purse she picked, and went a way
my Cousin cozened me*
The Uintner kicked me out of door
like a great Boobee.
At the Exchange when I came there,
I saw most gallan^ things
I thought the pictures livin^ (...)
of all our English Kings,
I doft my hat, and made a leg
and kneeled on my knee
The people laughed, and called me fool,
and great Boobee.
To Paris Garden then I went,
where there was great resort,
My pleasure was my punishment,
I did not like the sport.
The Garden bull with his ^^out horn^
on high then tossed me;
I did bewray my self with fear
like a great Boobee.
The Bear-heard went to save me then,
the people flockt about.
I told to the Bear-garden men,
my Guts were almost out,
They said I stunk most grievously
no man would pity me,
They called me witless Fool and Ass,
and great Boobee.
Then ore the water I did pass
as you shall understand,
I dropped into the Thames al^^
before I came to Land,
The Watermen did help me out,
and thus did say to me,
It Is not thy fortune to be drowned
thou great Boobee.
But I have learned so much wit
shall shorten all my cares,
If I can but a license get
to play before the Bears,
Twill be a gallant place indeed,
as I may tell to thee,
Then who dares call me Fool or Ass.
or great Boobee.
