BY THE SVPREAME COUNCIL OF THE CONFEDERATE CATHOLICQVES OF IRELAND
WE the supreme Council of the said Confederate Catholics, having of a
long time, with deep sense of the sufferings of the people, and the ways
taken to heap miseries on this afflicted. Kingdom, been equally distracted
between the care we were oblidged to have taken of the safety and welfare of
the Confederate Catholics, and the respect which was due from us, and has
been abundantly expressed by us to the Lord Archbishopp of Firmo, his
Hollynes extraordinary Nuntio in Ireland, we finding his Grace (by the
suggestions of a few persons, for their private ends averse to subjection, and
disaffected to any mean, by which a settlement (how advantageous and secure
soever for Catholic Religion) might be introduced) to insist on such ways as
may bring evident destruction upon this Nation; when neither by reason or
earnest solicitation, we could divert such proceedings, we are at leinght
enforced to admonish the Confederate Catholics (Whose lives and fortunes are
entrusted with us) that henceforth by any such groundles pretentions and
suggestions, or any act grounded there, upon, they be not withdrawn from that
obedience they owe unto our Commaundes, least they should expose themselves to
that confusion, and the Kingdom, to that distraction, which might be fatal
unto both. The Copy of a late declaration against the Cessation, made by a few
Bisshopps conuened before his Grace, and opposed by others of them, of exemplar
life and eminent learning, (albeit submitting in obedience to the Mayor vote of
that meeting they subscribed thereunto) this day affixed by order of the lord
Nuntio, the Lord Bishopp of Clogher, the Lord Bishopp of Rosse, and the Lord
Bishopp of Cork, has draweu us (much against our will) by this our public
declaration to vindicate the honor of the Kingdom, and betymes to forewarne
the Confederate Catholics, of the mischeefes which may be fall them, since now
we play nely see, that contrary to his Hollynes pious affections, for the
propagation of the Catholic Religion, the observance of due allegiance to his
Majesty, and the preservation of union among the Confederate Catholics
(these being the scope of the Lord Nuntio his mission,) all ways are attempted
to introduce the misery of distraction upon us, otherwise it could not be,
that use should now be made of that declaration, after we had, in concluding
the articles of that Cessation, fully provided for the free exercise of our
Religion and Function, and the possessions of our Clergy, and after the Lord
Nuntio had sent unto us, by Patrick Bryan and Geffrey Barron Esquiers, (as a
mean to make the Cessation conscionable) propositions merely Temporal,
Whereunto We have given ample satisfaction, as by the said propositions and
answeares now printed may appear. Now therefore, that We see noe end of the
afflictions, under which the people do groan, We do protest, that We may
not give Way to have the Government of the Kingdom entrusted With us, cast
down, and throd upon, nor permit that all affairs, of what nature soever,
shall ( in ordine ad spiritualia) deuolue to a Spiritual tribunal, which must
follow, if we may not (without license first had) either conclude Cessation,
regulate Armies, nominate Officers, appoint Commissioners, or dispose of places
of trust in the Civil list. And having resolved to represent unto his Hollynes
our condition, and humbly to beg, (as we do hereby) that he would be pleased
to give remedy unto these distractions (in which we find ourselves inuolued)
by assuming unto himself the judgment of the matter of Conscience, pretended
in the transactions of this Cessation, as the most powerful, proper, and
indifferent Judge, to whose sacred throne, in the behalf of the said
Confederate Catholics, we do therein appeal, We do premonish all and
every the Consederat Catholics, that nothing proceeding from the Lord Nuntio,
upon this or the like subject, do lessen the obedience, which by oath, and
otherwise they are oblidged to bear unto our Comaunds. Given at Kilkenny the
27 day of May 1648.
