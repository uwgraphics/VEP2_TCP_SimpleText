ARRAN.

WHEREAS by Proclamation Dated the fifth day of May, 1684. We the Lord Deputy
and Council, did for the reasons therein express, Restrain the Transportation
of all sorts of Corn, Meal and Malt, out of this Kingdom, unto any place what
so her beyond the Seas until Michaelmas next. And whereas we have since
received Information from several parts of the Kingdom, that there are great
quantities of Corn, remaining of the last Years Harbest, as yet undisposed,
more than will be necssary to supply the Occasion of the Subject until next
Harbest, which is now near approaching so as there can be no apprehension of the
fear of any Scarcity or Deatth at this time, We therefore think fit hereby to
take off the said Restraint prohibiting the Transportation of Corn, Meal and
Malt, as aforesaid, until We shall declare Our further pleasure therein. And
hereof We require the Commissioners for management of His Majesty's Revenue,
and all His Majesty's Officers in the several and respective Ports in this
Kingdom and all others whom it may concern, to take Notice.
