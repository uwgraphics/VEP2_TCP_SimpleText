A LITANY from GENEVA, In Answer to that from St. OMERS.
FRom the Tap in the Guts of the Honorable Stump,
From which runs Rebellion, that stinks like the Rump,
On purpose to leaven the Factious Lump,
Libera nos Domine.
From him that aspires as high as the Crown,
And vows to pull Copes and Cathedrals down,
Fit only to govern the World in the Moon.
Libera nos.
Form the Prick-ear'd Levite, that can without pain
Swear Black into White, then Vnswear it again;
Whose Name did design him a Villain in GRAIN,
Libera nos.
From his Black-Bills, and Pilgrims with Sticks in their hands,
That came to make a Religious Band,
Then Ravish our Wives, and Inhabit our Land,
Libera nos.
From the Mouth of the City, that never gives or
To complain of Oppressions unheard of before,
And yet for his Letchery will not quit score,
Libera nos.
From the Cent per Cent Scriv'ner, and all his State-tricks;
That crier out of Intemp'rance, who yet will not stick
To clear a youg Spend-thrist's Estate at a lick,
Libera nos.
From the Force and the Fire of the Insolent Rabble,
That would hurl the Government into a Babel,
And from the nice Fare of the Mouse-starver's Table,
Libera nos.
From the Elder in New-street, that Goggles and Cants,
Then turns up his Whites, to nose it, and pant,
And at the same time plays Devil and Saint,
Libera nos.
From Jenkin's Homilies drawn through the Nose,
From Langley, Dick, Baldwin, and all such as those,
And from Brawny Settle's Poem in Prose,
Libera nos.
From a Surfeit occasioned by Protestant Feasts,
From Sedition for Sauce, and Republics for Guests,
With Treason for Grace-Cup, or Faction at least,
Libera nos.
From the Conscience of Cits, resembling their Dames,
That in Private are Nice, but in Public so Tame,
That they will not stick out for a Touch of that Same,
Libera nos.
From the blind Zeal of all Democratical Tools,
From Whigland,, and all its Anarchical Rules,
Devised by Knaves, and Imposed on Fools,
Libera nos.
From the Late Times Revived, when Religion was gain,
And Church-Plate was seized for Relics Profane,
Since practiced by Searching Sir William again,
Libera nos.
From such Reformation where Zealots begun,
To preach Heaven must by firm Bulwarks be won,
And Te Deum sung from the mouth of a Gun,
Libera nos.
From Parliamentarians, that out of their Love
And Care for His Majesty's Safety, would prove
The securest way were His Guards to remove,
Libera nos.
From Saucy PETITIONS, that serve to inflame us,
From all who for the ASSOCIATION are famous,
From the Devil, the Doctor, and the Damned IGNORAMUS.
Libera nos.
