A LETTER, Sent to the Right Honorable EDWARD Earl of Manchester, Speaker pro
tempore in the house of PEERS.
My Lord,
Understanding his Highness Letters, have now at last bin read in both the
Honorable Houses, and that an Order has issued, to have them sent to the
Committee of the Admiralty; there to have the business stated, and reported to
the Honorable Houses, touching his Highness Ships, and the taking of them;
together with the proceedings as toward me his Highness Resident: I thought
it my part, standing in the place I do, to set up these Lights before the
Honorable Houses, lest part inandita altera their judgments might be still
misled in a matter of so great concernment.

For how can his Highness my Master expect an even and fair report to be made
from that Committee, which already prejudicating his Highness cause, has
imposed silence, not only upon* themselves in answering to his gracious
Letters, but upon me also his public Minister, or any sent by me to agitate
his Highness affairs at that Table, insisting still upon that Crambe of my
being only a pretended Agent? which imputation cannot appear to the
Honorable Houses, in any other shape then of Calumny,; his Highness having so
often iterated by his Letters to both the Honorable Houses, as also to diverse
particular Members of either House (your Lordship having been one of them) my
being his Resident, still honoring me in all those Letters with the style of
his Resident; which quality for these dozen years he has fixed upon me; which
also has been made evident by his several renewed Commissions, and I will
crown this verity with a testimony unquestionable, His Majesty's Royal
Letters sent me from Oxford, confirming under his Hand and Seal, the
privileges of my place, equal to those he gave to the greatest Ambassadors:
So that in all sense this ridiculous badge of Pretended, might have been cried
down long ere this, having no ground at all to subsist upon, but the opinion
of such who file their own dreams upon Record.

Now my Lord, for his Highness setting out men of War in a maritime way,
against his Enemy the French, who in prudence can fault it? he being a
Sovereign Prince, and in confederacy with the Catholic King, who gives him
the freedom of all his Ports, as by our last Prize taken and brought into
Ostena is made manifest; So as that fond cavil must be laid down, in
questioning his Highness right to arm at Sea.

The particulars of what some of his men under his Highness Commission have
done in this kind, I will here set down, and how they have been treated;
though with a more impartial pen then I presume the Honorable Houses will
receive from the Report of the Committee of the Admiralty, which already has
so much slighted his Highness, and passed sohard a censure upon those his
Affairs.

His Highness sending for Ireland a Ship called the St. Carlo, of 300. Tun,
to transport those men for Flanders, which he had levied there, it was taken by
a Parliament man of War in the River of Limrick, and though by Order from his
Highness, I made my complaints, yet could I not obtain of the Committee of
the Admiralty any redress; so that his Highness lost that Ship, and by that
occasion his men also, which being transported afterward in a weaker Vessel,
were taken at Sea by the Hollanders, presuming they were to serve the King of
Spain, for the States of Holland are not in Hostility with my Master.

Captain Antony a Flemming, being sent by his Highness the Duke of Lorraine
into Ireland, to conduct some Soldiers of Colonel Plunkets Regigiment, which
he had levied in Ireland for the Dukes Service, (his Highness seeing the
Spaniard and the French levy forces in Ireland, thought it as lawful for him
so to do as for them) Captain Antony upon his Highness charge bought a
Vessel in Waterford, in which he embarked some 30 or 40 men for Flanders, but
at Sea was taken by a Parliament Ship and brought Prisoner into Portsmouth, no
regard being had to his Highness Commission which he showed; There, were his
men kept Prisoners for many weeks on Shipboard, not being permitted to Land;
the Captain in the mean time got leave to come up to me to make his
complaints, in which I negotiated as much as possible I could, but was still
put off, in the mean time his Highness men, still on Shipboard, endured
extremity of misery, being forced sometimes for eight days together to drink
nothing but Sea water; In fine, I pressing that they might be used like
Christians, one in office in the Committee of the Admiralty answered me, that
he esteemed them no better then dogs: At the last the Captain was forced to
go into Flanders, there to buy another Ship to fetch his men away, his
Highness Vessel being here seized upon.

These were all young Gentlemen of Ireland, none of them above 20 years of age,
who had never borne Arms in that Kingdom, which I often intimated, but nothing
would be heard. The poor Youths being most of them Nobly borne, and tenderly
bred, being arrived in Flanders, immediately dyed upon these cruelties used
against them.

His Highness having intention to fight his Enemy the French, in all the
Elements he could, resolves to set up forces also by Sea, and having the
freedom of all the King of Spaines ports, was willing to entertain in that
service men of our Nation, as well as Dutch, Scots and Danes; whereupon
Captain George Grace, under Commission from his Highness, setting to Sea,
took upon the Coast of France, a Hanburger richly laden with French goods, as
we made to appear in the Admiralty Court, both by the Cocket, and Bills of
Lading, as by the confession of the Hanburger and his fellow Mariners under
their hands; nevertheless the Prize being taken from his Highness Captain,
by a Ship of the Parliament, commanded by Captain Filpot, with much violence
used to our Captain and his Company) was brought into Portsmouth, and here in
the Admiralty Court, adjudged no Price by Doctor Samms, then judge of the
Admiralty; and with such passion was the business carried, and in such
contempt of his Highness Commission, that Captain Grace was arrested in the
very Court whilst the cause was hearing, and all the Cockets, Bills of Lading,
and the testimonies of the Hanburgers taken from him. Thus was his Highness
defeated of his Prize, and of his own Ship.

Another Vessel was bought by his Highness, in which Captain Grace was
again set out, and pursuing a Frenchman in open Sea, the Frenchman fled to a
Parliament Ship which protected him, whereupon Captain Grace was forced to
desist, and sailed toward Poole, (where lying at Anchor to take in ballast,)
by Order from the Governor of Poole, he was seized upon by a Ship of the
Parliament, commanded by Captain Cartridge who brought him into Poole, where
the Governor kept the Ship for diverse months, and imprisoned the Captain and
his men without any ground at all, but upon cavil against his Commission; and
upon sinister informations caused the Captain to be sent up to London
Prisoner, by Order from the Committee of the Admiralty. By his means that
service was wholly lost, to his Highesse great damage and dishonor, though
afterward with much and much solicitation the Ship was restored, but with
excessive charge to his Highness, both in the clearing of her, and making her
fit again for Service.

His Highness still not doubting but to receive full satisfation for these
injuries offered him, sets out another Vessel, under Command of Captain
Faulkner, who upon the French Coast took a Frenchman and brought him into
Dartmouth, where the Governor seized upon him, and his Prize; but at last was
content to let Captain Paulkner depart with his own Vessel, but detained for
his own use and benefit the French Vessel (which was an excellent Swimmer)
and kept all the goods in her; and although by Order from his Highness, I made
my addresses to the Committee of the Admiralty for satisfaction, yet none could
I ever obtain. Neither wanted (upon all these several exigents) his Highness
Letters to both the Honorable Houses, demanding restitution in a fair way,
but so far was that off, as to this hour his Highness never received any.
Nevertheless his Highness not intending in these his intentions for Sea, to
exclude our Nation, sets out Captain Faulkner again, who taking a Frenchman,
not within command of any Fort or Castle of this Kingdom, as is pretended
(which appeared by a shot made from Mount-Batten which reached not Captain
Faulkner by a mile and upward) brought confidently his Prize into the Isle of
Wight, where he was presently seized upon by Colonel Hammond; the Captain and
all his men cast into Prison; his Prize taken from him, and sold before his
face (which showed no intention of restoring it to the French, had they had any
right to it) and an inventory sent up to the Committee of the Admiralty of the
goods, to a very small valuation, though the Prize was worth 600 li. the ship
being laden with Wines, Rozen, Pitch, Pruens, and the like French Commodities
of value; All the solicitation possible I could make in his Highness behalf,
and withal delivering his Highness Letters to both the Honorable Houses,
(filled with much sweetness and affection toward this Nation) to obtain
satisfaction, none ever yet was thought upon, nor that there was any such
Princeas the Duke of Lorrayne, whose Letters were worthy of answer. In witness
still of this high misprission, four of his seamen are yet in extreme misery,
detayned in the Common-Goale of Winchester, where they are ready to perish; and
both the French Ship, and the Dukes also, are imbarged, and seized upon before
the Isle of Wight.

At the same time Captain Anderson having received his Highness Commission,
went down to Portsmouth, where having gotten to him some few Seamen, and
bought a small Vessel to transport themselves to Ostend, there to be put upon
a greater Ship; no sooner was it known, that they were to serve under the Duke
my Masters Commission (having yet never attempted any thing) were seized upon
and detained in prison for many weeks, to the overthrow of that his Highness
service, and the undoing of the poor men: after my many solicitations, and
many repulses, they were at last freed from their most unjust imprisonment, but
with no consideration had of their losses.

These several passages of disgrace, having been put upon the Duke, my Master,
with so stiff a silence in both the Honorable Houses to his Highness so many
courteous Letters, have caused (I presume) this last Letter of his to both the
Houses, to make some expression of his resentment, in demanding of the
Parliament of England, whether they desire to have him their Friend or their
Enemy.

And although I, my Lord, am servant to this great Prince, who at this hour
commands an Army of his own of 12000. as gallant men as the Sun shines upon,
most of them old Soldiers, of understanding, as well able to command, as of
wills ready to obey, having borne for many years the weight and scoarching of
the day, who with often graplings have made soft unto their hands the hardness
of war, glorying more in their honorable Scarrs then in their Scarlets, and
are at their height of joy, when they hear the Trumpets call to a Battle; yet
am I still an English man, and so zealous a Patriot, as most willingly would I
Sacrifice my life in the continuation of that ancient League and Amity, which
has ever been between this Kingdom and the House of Lorrayne, that Mother
of Princes, that Nurcery of Kings, whose Royal steame has extended its
flourishing Branches over most of the Thrones of Europe, whose now Regnant
Heir, the Duke my Master, looking upon the rich Ornaments of his Sovereignty,
values the greatest Juell in it, his so near alliance to our Sovereign Lord,
Charles, King of England, France, Scotland, and Ireland, whose present
condition he behols with eyes full of affections, and cleared from all Mists of
mistake.

I conclude my Lord, with my own disinterest; it is not (I am confident) the
pleasure of my Master to call me off from this Station, by way of compliance
with the Honorable Houses, till that abusive attribute of pretended, be taken
off from me his real Minister: for what judgment can think such an
imputation should be laid upon me, from any doubt in matter of fact, as whether
his Highness ownes me for his Resident, or not? but rather the doubt seems to
be raised in matter of his Highness Power, whether he can constitute any
Public Minister.

And to question this, will but express more and more the weakness of those
who doubt it, and make his Highness more and more reflect upon his own Powers.

But did the stream run clear (as formerly) which now begins to be troubled
between his Highness my Master, and the Honorable Houses, I should receive
those endeavors most joyfully, which should effectually obtain my recalling,
for the cause of my stay here being now rightly stated, the difference appears
between his Highness the Duke of Lorraine, and the Parliament of England, and
not between the Parliament of England, and

Your Lordships most humble Servant, ANTHONY FORTESCUE, Resident for his
Highness of Lorraine.
April 20. 1648.
