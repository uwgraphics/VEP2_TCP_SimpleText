A LETTER FROM EDINBURGH, Containing a true and perfect Relation of all the
Passages and Proceedings of the late Army, raised in Scotland; By order of
Parliament: for the Prosecuting of the Ends of the League and Covenant,
concerning Religion, Liberty, and His Majesty's Lawful Authority, by the
Well-affected Subjects of that Kingdom, Showing the Progress thereof, from the
beginning of the Engagement: unto the end of that unfortunate Expedition.

Written by an Eye-witnes, who was both an Actor, and Inspector of all Men's
Carriages, in the march until the Deroute of the Army.

To a Friend at London, for the better Information of all those who desire to
know the plain Truth.

Printed 12 of November, 1648.

SIR,
Being now by the providence of God, got out of the reach of rigor, and
fearing neither the doggednesse of a Iaylour nor the Voyage of Barbados; but
Enjoying the freedom of my former life, and the company of my Friends,
knowing also how great a desire you have to hear of me, both in my own
particular Fortune, and Success of that late Unfortunate Army in the North, I
acknowledge my self bound in duty to Satisfy your longing, and give you a
true and perfect Relation of the Progress and Event of that Expedition, But
shall remit the Story of mine own Adventures and return, unto another occasion,
it being but of small moment, and the other so necessary to be known of every
one who loves Truth, of which I may freely say; I can tell as much as any
private Person that was in the Journey, for being an Eye-witnes and Actor from
the first Levying of the Troops, unto the day of the Desaster, and having
haunted the Chief Commanders for my better Information of what past in the
Army, I can the more assuredly give you an exact account of the most Material
Passages in that Expedition, Wherein I protest before God, I shall strip my
self of all Passion and Partiality, for the discharge of my Conscience; and
defense of the Truth, to give you this free and following Narration, Whatsoever
malice may perhaps have blown abroad to Poison the Seduced people with
misreports.

I shall not here insist upon the opposition made in the Parliament of Scotland
against the Levy, nor the Jealousy that possessed some, in the choice of the
Commanders, as perhaps being men who had their own ends, or aspired to that
Domination which others had long Usurped, and would be loath to lay down again,
both parties still pretending the keeping of the Covenant, and that Jealousy
was Fomented by the Ministry, which every day preached against the Engagement,
There was also a Party, which not siding with any of the other two, pressed
the calling home of the Prince, so to decide all differences, and prevent
heartburning in the point of Command, at which time also a black cloud in the
West did threaten a Deludge to destroy the good design, but that was soon
Dissipate by the wisdom and valor of the Earl of Calander, Leivetenant
General of the Army, and Middleton Leivetenant General of the Horse at
Machlinmoore, by order from the Lord Duke Hamilton. And not long after His
Grace received order from the Committee of Estates, to march speedily to the
English border, for securing of Carlisle, and opposing of Major General
Lambert, mean while all the strong holds of the Kingdom as Edinburgh, Sterling,
Dumbarton, and the rest were yet in the hands of the well-affected Party, (as
was supposed) or might have been easily secured, But what difficulties were
made concerning the Forces in Ireland, led by General Major George Monro, for
the finding of moneys to pay and transport them, it being resolved they
should be under the Command of the Earl of Crawford Lindsay Treasurer, I need
not to relate, and therefore to begin my Journall, take it thus.

About the beginning of July, His Grace appointed a Rendevous at Annan; where
the small number that resorted at first made us stay some few days. Upon the 8
We entered England, and quartered that night at Rokliff, the next day the Army
marched by Carlisle, and quartered at Thursby, there the General receiving the
keys of the Town, and Castle, from Sir Philip Musgrave, went up into the
Castle, and gave order our ammunition should be left there, though the custody
of both was still in the hands of the English, for some few days, which showed
how great confidence he had in them, at Thursby diverse horse and foot of ours
came unto us and we heard that some, both horse and foot were come over out of
Ireland, landed in Galloway; and marching toward Dumfries, there also we saw
Sir Marmaduck Langdalls foot, and one Troup of horse, which were all proper
men, General Major Lambert was then at Penreth, toward which upon Friday the
14 we advanced, but were benighted and came short 2 or 3 miles, yet having got
two horsemen prisoners, discovered the Enemy, and so posing our guards it
being very late, we quartered there. Next morning early our Cavalrie advanced
(the weather being very rainie) and the foot following, found that Lambert
with his Forces was retired that night toward Appleby (in which Castle he had
a garrison,) our intention was to overtake his Rear, but we were informed that
they were for certain at Appleby, before we were two miles past Penreth, Which
made us stay and quarter there that night, and the next day which was Sunday,
upou Moonday setting forward toward Appleby with our horse, We discovered a
body of Lamberts Cavalrie, which being pressed upon by some of ours, was forced
to retire within the barricade near unto the bridge at Appleby, which our folks
could not force for want of the foot, whom the rain and waters did extremely
hinder in their march; the Enemy having his foot at the barricade neither could
our horse pass the River to reach Lamberts Army which was on the other side,
by reason of the great inundation through excessive raines, in the evening some
few foot came up to us, and we endeavoring to gain the Bridge were prevented
by night, some few of each side being killed and hurt, amongst whom Colonel
Harison of theirs was wounded, and the Earl of Calander received a musket
shot upon his left side, that night our Cavalrie remained on the fields, and
Sir Marmaduck Langdalls foot came up, but ours stayed at Kirby-Thure, that same
night also Lambert marched over Stain-moore. Leaving yet a garrison in Appleby
Castle, before which Sir Marmaduck with his foot, lay down till the Surrender
thereof, during which time, Sir Thomas Tilsley had a Commission given him, for
the raising of Forces in Lancashire, out of Furnis, and their-abouts, the next
day the Duke sent back freely a Lieutenant to Lambert who had been taken the
day before, and disposing the horse into several quarters we stayed there a
fortnight waiting for our Cannon ammunition and meall, while we stayed at
Kirby-Thure, it was much pressed that the Irish Forces might join with us, and
the Cannon be left behind which was not very considerable being but 4 six
pound balls, and 2 twelve, in the Counsel of war also it was debated whither
the Army should march into Yorkshire, to follow Lambert, or through Lancashire,
which was a plentiful Country, and into which our ammunition might with
greater safety come unto us, the other being wasted and spoiled by the Enemy,
at last it was resolved to march into Lancashire, it was likewise propounded to
put the Kingdom of Scotland in a Posture of defense, by raising of an Army to
be commanded by the Earl of Lanrick. From Kirby-Thure we marched in two days
to Kendall, where General Major George Monro a valiant and worthy commander
(whose courage and conduct in the wars of Ireland, have with credit gained
him an honorable name,) came unto us, and the Duke was again desired those
Forces from Ireland might join with us, but what answer or order was given to
Monro, himself best knows, howsoever he returned to his own Forces, and we
marched from Kendall to Hornby in Lancashire, and there again upon debate of
the quartering of the horse, which was extremely straited, it was ordained they
should march under the command of the Earl of Calander and Middleton, leaving
two brigades of horse, and the Dukes own leiff-guard to remain with him, upon
the rear of the Foot: and the Irish Forces, with Monro, were again urged to be
joined with the Army, by showing what danger they might incur, He marching by
the Enemies garrisons and from Skipton, if they should fall in betwixt him and
us, which was of more consequence then the leaving of the Cannon, We having
found the wickedness of the way so troublesome for carriages, that night the
Cavalrie past by the Town of Lancaster, and quartered at Garstang, which was
upon the 13 of August, the next morning, I saw his Grace, and the Earl of
Calander, upon a hill, near Lancaster, into which he had sent Sir Thomas
Tilsleys folk who were playing with their Muskets upon the Castle, and after
conference, the Earl of Calander returned to his quarter at Garstang. Upon the
15 Sir Marmaduck Langdall, gave notice to Calander and Middleton who were then
quartered at Blackburn of the Enemies advancing toward Skipton, and to the Duke
also, as Calander likewise did, whereupon the next morning Calander and
Middleton, meeting with Sir Marmaduck, at the Earl Marshalls quarter, some 5
or 6 miles above Preston, he confirmed the intelligence of the Enemies advance,
and desired quarters nearer Preston, which was granted, and order given to the
Lord Levingston to remove his brigade, as he did, drawing into a field, where
the foot was thought to have been, as was concluded before at Hornby, that
night Middleton returned to Blackburn, and Calander going to find the Duke,
whom he supposed to be at Preston according as was resolved, by the way was
informed that he was 3 miles short of it, and quartered at Broughtoun with the
foot, which should have been a Preston that night, which fault was the main
ground of all our misfortune, at last Calander coming to the Dukes quarter
late, show him of Sir Marmaducks drawing nearer Preston, and of the order given
to those Regiments of the Lord Levingstouns Brigade to do the like, and how his
Grace was expected there with the Army, seeing the safety thereof, depended
wholly thereupon, the horse being quartered on the other side, toward Whiggin
(except those two brigades, were left with him,) the Duke answered that he
could not get carriages for the ammunition, Calander told him of the enemies
advancing, and that some of them had been seen among their friends, as also by
some Parties of Horse who were sent out to discover, the Duke confessed he had
notice of it, but is was then late, and they should speak of it to morrow, But
whither that security proceeded from a confidence, or weakness, in a General
God knows. Next morning Calander coming to him, asked where the Army was, he
answered that they marched timely in the morning, and he thought by that time
they were the length of Preston; (where they should have been the day before)
afterward Calander asked him where were these two brigades of horse which were
left with him, he said he had given them no orders, and that they were still
lying in their quarters, not having sent any ordinance Ruyters to receave
order, Whereupon I heard Calander say, he much admired his Grace had caused the
Foot to march, and not sent order express to the horse which marched with him,
though they had been wanting in that point, Seeing his own safety and the
Armies, was so deeply interest into it, and immediately Calander sent two
express (least the Enemy should fall in betwixt them, as they did:) with
orders to those brigades, to march to Preston, and join with the foot, which
nevertheles, they could not, after breakfast the Duke called for his horse, it
being about nine a-clock, and as he was going to get up, Sir Marmaduck came,
where I heard Calander say, your Grace is too far from your Army, get on before
he light, which he did, and so they saluted on horseback riding toward the
Army, within twice twelve score, one came and told Sir Marmaduck, that the
Enemy was falling upon his rear, (you must know that he had still marched upon
our left hand, from his quartering at Settle and Sigelswyk) and thereupon they
all fell a galloping, until they came near Preston, to the entry of the lane
upon the end of the moore, where they found Leivetenant General Baylie, with
the Foot, drawn up in battle, and all the baggage by him, yet a little before
we came to the foot, we were told it was but a mistake, though shortly after
the Enemy did appear, and fell a skirmishing with Sir Marmaducks rear, when
Calander Baylie and Colonel Turner coming to the Duke, after some discourse
amongst them, order was given to the Foot to pass the bridge, some of the
Enemies horse showing themselves upon the heath on our left hand. Then the
Earl of Calander desired the Duke to send for Middleton with the Cavalrie, and
whilst the foot were marching, the Duke thought fit to leave three brigades
upon the moore to favor Sir Marmaducks retreat, which Calander desired his
Grace to consider, and that commanded musketeers would be better in those
narrow lanes, whereof the best both of Officers and Soldiers might be piked
out, and so they were and Calander commanded out 500 Musketeers to line the
hedges and 600 more further down toward the end of the bridge, (if the enemies
horses should advance) and a brigade consisting of the Earl of Roxburghs
regiment, and Colonel Tours to favor Sir Marmaducks retreat, on the other
hand two parties of Horse were commanded out of those few troops we had to
discover the enemies advance which left but few remaining, by reason of a
party had been sent to Sir Marmaduck at his own desire, the two brigades not
being come up, for the Lord Levingstouns brigade being pressed by the enemy had
past the water marching down on the other side toward Preston bridge, where he
came about two of the clock in the afternoon, and having sent before to
receave orders the Duke commanded one Glass who did the duty of
Quartermaster General, to give out quarters for his brigade in such Towns as
he named, and that after sight of the billet he should march to his quarter,
there was likewise, afterward another hundred commanded which the Earl of
Calander desired might stay until they saw whether the enemy did advance
toward the moore, in regard there were so few horse there (the word and sign
being then given) but seeing none advanced, that hundred horse with the same
officers was sent to Sir Marmaduck, besides 200 musketeers which had been sent
before; though undemanded of him, but the Scots foot and baggage were so long
in marching and passing the narrow lane and bridge as spent much time, and
ammunition, Sir Marmaduck sending twice or thrice for supply of ammunition
which he had, the Duke remained still on the head of those few horse never
visiting Sir Marmaducks post, but Calander riding to and again, betwixt the
horse and foot where the most eminent danger did appear, went up to Sir
Marmaduck to know what he wanted (though he had no interest in his Army) the
other thanked him kindly and desired to know if the whole Army was past,
Calander told him it was very near, Whereupon Sir Marmaduck entreated him that
he might know of it and Calander assured him he should do it, thereafter it was
my fortune to be near the Duke, when Calander came to him, his Grace asked
where he had been, and why he did not stay upon the head of the horse, he
answered that he did not conceive the greatest danger to be there in regard the
enemies horse did not advance.

But let me here stay a little, while the foot and baggage are passing the
bridge to consider the reasons given for this Resolution, our Cavalrie being
far distant, and the enemy according to Sir Marmaducks intelligence, being
said to have divided his Forces, whereof some part was marched toward Colne and
Manchester, was it not likely that Sir Marmaduck was able to deall with them
having betwixt 3 and 4 thousand foot, and 7 or 8 hundred horse, with the
assistance of some of our horse which was marching toward us? Or say, was it
fit to expose our foot having no horse but a handful to the enemies whole
Cavalrie and Foot, Upon a flat campaign or moore if his intelligence was false?
His Graces great judgment and long experience (having been twice before a
General, by sea and land, at home and abroad; together with his earnest desire
of that command, notwithstanding the advice of his friends to the contrary, and
the jealousy that possessed all men of him, which rather kindled then quench
the fire of his high spiritfull of his own sufficiency) was no question capable
to weigh any counsel in the scales of Reason, whether it were of valor to be
taken or not, and therefore I may say in all freedom who ever gave it, was no
raw nor fresh water soldier, however the end proved, and now the foot and
baggage being almost past the bridge, the Earl of Calander drew the Troops
nearer unto it within the lane, where he and Colonel Turner (I fortuned to be
with them for the time also) riding back to the Towns end of Preston toward
the bridge, we found a Troup returning from thence upon sight of us, whereat we
wondered until by their arms and sign, (which was a green bough) We perceaved
them to be enemy (for ours was white) Whereupon the Earl of Calander called to
the Musketeers to give fire, which though they did not upon the order, yet the
Enemy hearing retreated within the lane, and himself advancing gave fire with
his pistol upon them and they faced about, So he and I parted about this time
I was informed that Captain Watsone who commanded the Dukes lieff-guard of
horse does affirm that he being on Prestoun-moore perceiving the enemies horse
to be drawing out of an narrow lane into the moore where they stood, he went to
his Grace who was close by and show him of it beseeching him to give them leave
to charge the enemy before they should be in order, hoping with that advantage,
to give him an account of them, but contrair to his expectation the Duke in
passion commanded him not to loose a pistol upon no pretext whatsoever, I
riding afterward toward the bridge, heard a great noise behind me, the enemy
turning again toward the Town and all our people running, coming near I found
some stragglers and baggage horse, and after a little while Calander came
alone, his horse much spent and wearied, who gave presently order to Rally
these stragglers and rode himself and brought Kelheads Regiment of foot which
was upon the rear and said the musketeers into some dry ditches near the
bridge, the pikes he placed in the most Advantageous ground, the enemy advanced
presently but our men giving fire upon them they retired again to pursue the
rest of our people, who had quited their ground, We not having any Horse and
Baylie being with the foot upon a hill, half a mile distant from the bridge on
the other side of the water, then came one to the Earl of Calander telling him
that the enemy was passing the River, below the bridge at a Church, whereupon
giving order to Kelhead to make good that post, promising to supply him with
fresh men, if it were needful: and having sent before to Baylie for 300
musketeers he met them by the way as he was going to the Church and sent
Leivetenant Colonel Halst with one hundred and fresh ammunition to the bridge,
another hundred he left upon a little hill betwixt the bridge and the Army, and
the third he took along to the Church where it was said that the enemy was
passing, where being come he found no such thing, then leaving some to man the
Churchyard he and Colonel Turner, came back and heard that they were passing
above which made them rerire to the Leagger where they met the Duke (who told
them how narrowly he had escaped, and almost been taken prisoner, in the Town
of Preston) and there they were again told of the Enemies passing above, the
Earl of Calander presently called for horse, it was long before any came: And
these few only of the Lord Kenmoores, with which he drew down to the bridge to
second the foot, but the third time being advertised that they were passing
above the bridge, he drew toward the place, and sending out three horsemen
before, followed with the rest, till on the way those three returning told him
there was no such matter, but only some of our own stragglers passing which
were routed on the other side, and coming back toward the bridge: he found
that the enemy had forced it after a long and hard dispute through the
advantage of the ground and cover of houses and hedges, whereas on our side it
was very low and no shelter at all, and was pursuing of our folks toward the
Leagger, which made him cause a house be set on fire in their way a little
below the Leagger, about a musket shot, The day being near spent a small party
of the enemy passing by the second bridge followed up the hill within a lane
where the Duke, Calander, Baylie, and many other Officers were standing on the
other side of the hedge within the foot Leagger, the musketeers having order
to give fire, they presently retreated but we had no horse to follow;
Kennioores Regiment being retired behind the foot, then a counsel was called,
where the Duke, Calander, Baylie, Colonel Turner, the Earl of Dumfries, the
Lord Bargeny, and many other Officers were (Sir Lewis Dives was there likewise)
there Calander enclyned to retire to a moore on this side of Wiggan, where we
might expect our horse and attend the enemy to fight them. But afterward upon
some consideration finding the impossibility of transporting the ammunition he
altered his opinion (as I heard) and though the most part of the Votes run in
that strain yet he upon more mature deliberation, disassented from it,
protesting he would bear no blame if things did not succeed according to his
wish and real intention. The Duke replied it was concluded and too late to
oppose, giving order to the Regiments to send for as much ammunition as they
pleased, and that Calander should march presently with those few horse they had
then there toward Standish-moore, the night being very dark, and the lanes
narrow and deep, a Regiment of foot which was advanced before the horse
Rencountring, some of our own horse who had been quartered with Middleton (and
by some of the foot stragglers were supposed to be enemy; upon whom they gave
fire) took the alarm so hot that many quited their arms, Whereupon Calander
advanced and found them to be our own, so he marched on to the moore where he
halted till it was day, (that night we left our ammunition) but before that it
was day the Duke had past through the Troops and was gone to Wiggan, where
Calander and the Earl of Traquair went to him there he asking for Middleton,
they told him they had no notice of him but that he was marched toward
Preston, and was in the Rear, and that the foot were advancing into the moore,
showing also how necessary his presence was to encourage the Soldiers after
so ill fortune and hard marches as they had, Then he desired Calander to draw
them all up in battle upon the moore: and he would follow, which was
straightway done, and after some time the Duke came, Leivetenant General
Middleton according to his order advancing toward Preston, and not finding the
Army retired after them, and the enemy falling upon his rear he repulsed them
diverse times, and forced them to give back, carrying himself most bravely like
a gallant man, and wise commander, and came to the moore about ten a-clock,
where he found the foot, and those horse they had with them drawn up, the
Marquis of Argyles Regiment and the dragoons were placed at the entry of the
moore to favor his retreat, and staying there till two a-clock some small
parties of the enemy skirmishing, it was resolved to march, the body of the
horse first leavying upon the rear of the foot, General Major Vandrosk,
Leivetenant Colonel James Innes, and Leivetenant Colonel David Lindsay with
some troops of horse, together with Argyles Regiment of foot, and Colonel
Mills few dragoons, in this order the Army marched, and the Earl of Calandar,
Middleton, Baylie, and Turner, stayed upon the moore, until the most of them
were marched into the lane, Middleton then advancing to the horse, Calander
remained till the whole rear of the foot was entered the lane, at which time he
had notice given him of the enemies advancing upon the right hand to fall in
betwixt the horse and foot, between there and Wiggan, upon the advertisment he
advanced to know the certainty, but it proved false in regard of some marish
ground, and no appearance of Enemy there, afterward coming to Wiggan he found
the Duke, (of whom he went to receave orders) at the further end of the Town
marching with the horse, but by the straitnes of the lane and narrownes of the
bridge, together with the deepnes of the way, many of the foot which was
extremely wearied having before suffered hugely in the want of victuals was
lost, and the horse were a long time in passing the water, so as night drew on
when Middleton hearing of the enemy upon the Rear went back and there the
Officers of the commanded Troops of horse behaving themselves like brave men
were most hurt and taken. The Duke sending for Calander told him he should do
well to march on with the Cavalrie to Warringtoun, where there was a pass and
bridge of which he much feared the Enemy should possess themselves, and so
bring the Army into great inconveniences, a little after as he was marching,
the Duke sent him word he would yet speak with him so he let the Troops march
on forward through the narrow lanes, (it being moonlight) and stayed till the
Duke and Sir Marmaduck came up to him, there the Duke again showed him his
apprehension of the Enemies seazing upon that pass from the neighbor
Garrisons, willing him to march without ever halting until he had made himself
master of the same, Calander forthwith sending a Party before to discover the
Enemy, and save the stragglers, from plundering by reason of the night, (some
of Sir Marmaducks and our^ also being gone out before) when we were within a
mile of Warrington, we heard that the Enemy had taken in the Bridge, but upon
the advance of our fore-troupes had again quited and was run away, before we
entered the Town, the Duke and Sir Marmaduck came up, and there lighting his
Grace sent order to Leivetenant General Middleton, and Baylie, to advance
thither, seeing the next day they were to march to White-Church; and so for the
Peak, Calander gave order for the Horse to Rendevous the next morning at the
bridge, the most part being quartered on the other side, but betimes news was
brought that the Enemy had routed the Foot, though the General had not heard
any thing from Baylie, nor Middleton, about eight a clock at the Rendevous, we
heard that the Enemy was passing the River upon our left hand, Whereupon
Calander sent out a Party to a foard, and a little after I saw the Duke march
by, to the top of the hill where Sir Marmaducks Horse were, and but few of the
Scots Horse were yet come to the Rendevous, there I heard the Earl of Calander
ask Colonel Mill, if any of his Dragoons were come up, his answer was, none,
by reason they were all dispersed in the evening before, by this time Sir
Marmaducks Troops were marching off the hill, and Calander with his own three
Troops, and three of the Earl of Errolls, which were all very weak retired
to the top of the hill, where he was told that orders were sent to the Foot to
make their own conditions, But let me here tell you, that I believe, if that
had been propounded to Calander He would have been as refractary from it, as
he was afterward upon the like occasion concerning the Horse, there he was
likewise told that the Duke was marched after Sir Marmaduck, and after some
stay there, not hearing any thing he marched after the Duke, supposing the
intelligence to be true, Sir Marmaduck marching still on the Van, with his few
Horse, and his Rear being pretty-well advanced before the Scots horse, some
few of the Enemies Foot lying at a pass Sallyed out upon certain Stragglers of
the Scots, but were presently beat back by the Lord Levingstoun; and Major
Drummond, down to their Barricade, having lost some, and others hurt; there
Calander made some Troupers light from their horses, and force their passage,
thinking that to be the way, which was not, and therefore we took to the left
hand, and followed Sir Marmaducks Troops that were marched on with the Duke,
about four miles further at a halt, Middleton came up alone, and after some
conference returned, (with great discontent) to his Troops showing that the
Foot was yielded up at Warrington, we were that night to quarter at
White-Church, and upon the march I heard an Officer of quality, propound to
the Earl of Calander, the necessity of thinking upon a Treaty, in regard of
the Soldiers long and wearisome marches, they being in great disorder and
their horses tired, which if he and Middleton would condescend unto, they put
no question but the Duke would likewise, but he absolutely refused to hear of
it, saying, they were yet a considerable body of Horse with which they might
shortly recover an Army of Foot, and that they were within a day and a halfs
marching, of a place where they might be in safety to refresh themselves and
their Horses, but upon the march we were so hindered with frequent, though false
alarmes and halts, (no Enemy being near us, but Garrisons) that we came short
of White-Church, 2 or 3 miles, and quartered in the fields that night near
Malpas, in Chesshire, where Sir Marmaduck, Calander, and Middleton, attended
the Duke, resolving from thence to march to Vtoxater and to so Ashburn, in the
Peak, that night diverse Officers left their Troops, and rendered themselves
prisoners to the Enemy, which did much dishearten the Soldiers, diverse
Officers likewise of the Foot, who would not accept of the conditions which
Leivetenant General Baylie made at Warrington, came up to the Cavalrie, the
next day we marched about a mile beyond Drayton, and quartered in the fields,
upon the 12 of August we marched toward Vtoxater, and coming near Stone a
troup of the enemies which lay there, drew out upon the hill on our left hand,
we saw also more troops from Staffoord upon our right hand, there at a halt,
what pains Calander and Middleton did take to get the disorderly troops,
(whose discontent and disobedience upon their Officers abandoning of them, had
forgot all respect unto command) into order, and bring them under their
standards, can neither be expressed by me, nor imagined by those who have never
seen the like mutiny, yet at length they brought them to it. But by the way
between the bridge and Stone, I saw Calander and Middleton come to the Duke,
who show them a letter he had received from the Committee of Shropshire,
brought by two Committee men, the tenor of it was to give quarters to the Duke,
and his people upon laying down of their arms, whereat they both did much
wonder, that a Committee would offer any such thing to an Army, they having no
other Forces but their Garrisons, (but there was a whispering amongst the
troupers, that a trumpet had been sent to the Enemy) Sir Marmaducks troops
having the Van marched through the Town, Calander with his next, and Middleton
in the rear placing a guard on this side of Stone, till all were past, the
Commissioners were appointed by the Duke, to stay and dine in the Town, upon a
halt on the other side, I saw the Duke, Calander, Sir Marmaduck, and Middleton,
speaking together where there came a Trumpet to them, from Staffoord, who
belonged to some of those who had rendered themselves prisoners the night
before, here a Trouper upon some question shot Captain Gray, and was pistold by
public order for it. So on we marched for Utoxater, Sir Marmaduck in the Van
of all, the Duke in the Van of the Scottish horse, Calander in the middle, and
Middleton in the rear having marched about two miles in narrow lanes, (it began
to rain hugely) the Staffoord troops being upon our rear, Middleton gave
order to charge them, but some troupers repining said it was nothing to bid
charge, whereunto he replied that it was not his custom to be sparing of
himself upon any occasian that was needful, and therewithal bid them follow
him, and charged like a gallant man, and wise commander, thereby to animate his
discouraged horsemen, and show them a good example, in such an extremity, but
being upon the side of a hill, and the ground exceeding slipperie through the
great raines, his horse fell and he was taken prisoner, and the night drawing
on, the enemy retired being pressed by Colonel Lockhart, who was in the rear
with him, the rest of the horse were drawn up upon a moore, where there came
two Country Gentlemen to the Duke, but from whence or what they brought, I
could not learn. Upon the notice of Middletons being taken, Calander faced
about and marched to the rear, where speaking to the soldiers, he desired
them now to do for the honor of their Nation, which then had so much suffered,
and the recovery of so gallant a man, swearing to them never to leave them if
they would but perform their part, and with that resolution went on to rescue
Middleton until he understood from Colonel Lockhart, that the Enemy was
retired, Whereupon he returned to the moore, where he halted until the rear
came up, before which time it was dark night, being then about 4 miles from
Utoxater, unto which by reason of the darkness and foulnes of the way, it was
very late before the troops did come, quartering most upon the fields and
streets, next morning betimes Calander, and Sir Matmaduck, attended the
General, who was a bed (because of a pain in his legs,) there he having heard
before that Calander was marched away, with the most part of the horse told it
him, but Calander answered that he had not used to give any orders where his
Grace was, but such as he received from him, there it was debated what was next
to be done, But then Sir Marmaduck show the necessity of his marching when it
was propounded to Capitulate, and that he could expect no quarter, Calander
also declared plainly that upon no terms he would consent to a Capitulation,
but such Troops or Troupers as would march with him he would undergo the same
hazard with Sir Marmaduck, and they might follow him, which the Duke hearing,
said that he would not stay behind, and therewith Sir Marmaduck and Calander
went to horse, and gave order to the Troops to draw out to a hill, about half
a mile on the other side of the Town beyond the River, yet it was long before
any considerable number came to the place, and Sir Marmaduck sending to
Calander, to know if he was ready, my Lord desired him to have a little
patience, but he sent him back word that the day was well advanced, and he was
to have a long march he could not, and so marched away, which Calander seeing
spoke to the Officers and Soldiers, willing them to repair to their standards
in order, but none almost or very few did, though he assured them that he would
die with his arms in his hand, after such misfortune, rather then Capitulate,
yet what ever he said, was little regarded, and because the Duke was absent no
man obeyed, at last he told them, that such as had a mind to show themselves
men, for the credit of their Country, might march along with him, and those
that were ill mounted and had a mind to treat, might stay with the Duke, but
few offered to stir, so that he rode after Sir Marmaduck alone, to show him
how things stood, and take leave of him, coming back he found some Officers
sent from the Duke, to desire his return for consultation, and the Duke gave
order that a party should be sent back to Utoxater, whither the Army might
return, and there deliberate of what should be done, to that effect the Lord
Levinstoun was sent, and Calander visited all the avenues and barricaded them,
posing guards every where, then orders being given, for all Officers to repair
to the Duke, He then desired Calander to go and advise with them what was most
expedient, thereupon Calander asked him whither to march, or to fight, he was
ready to obey, but if it were to Capitulate he absolutely disclamed it, and so
went to his quarter, where he instantly gave order to the dismounted men, and
Stragglers of the Foot, to go to the Churchyard, and that all Officers that
were quartered in the Town, should bring thither such arms as could be found
there, for arming of them These Officers who were assembled by the Dukes order
having delivered there opinions, when Calander came back, the Duke told him
they had found it fit to send a trumpet to the Enemy, but Calander replied that
he disassented from such a base way, and therefore would give no advice, nor
adhere to their Treaty, neither be included into it, but rather die like a man
of honor, fighting if he could find but ten men, to share in his fortune with
him, the Duke notwithstanding sent out a Trumpet, and in a short while after,
some Troupers drew up on the markat-place before his lodging (which certainly
was not done without the knowledge of some chief Officers,) for when Calander
went out to speak to them, they were not so well instructed as afterward, till
putting them in mind of the Oath he made unto them the night before never to
leave them, if they would play the part of gallant men, but that he would upon
no condition Capitulate, choosing rather to run the uttermost hazard of his
life with honor, then condescend to so base a way of Treaty, if otherwise he
could not escape the hands of his Enemies, at length they seemed to be a little
satisfied, so he returned to the Dukes lodging, and Colonel Lockhart was sent
down to dismiss them, but toward the evening, their number increased and
seasing upon Calanders Horse and arms, they would not suffer him to go out of
the Dukes lodging, but keept him there prisoner, nor were any of his servants
permitted to come near him, but before that uproar began, as soon as it was
concluded by the Duke, and the other Officers to send and Capitulate, the
trumpet being gone, Major Gib and another were sent as Ostages. In the evening
the trumpet came back, and one of the Enemies with him, who found us in this
posture of munity, and that increasing hourly, (it was then clear moonshine)
when they rose to such a height that they releived the guards, which the
Leivetenaut General had posed, sent up 2 or 3 of their number to the Dukes
chamber, with their arms in their hands, as Commissioners from the rest, which
he seeing, declared to them that he had no mind to leave them, and spoke unto
the whole body upon the market place, out at a window, the Enemies trumpet who
was in the next room heard all, Calander incensed with that scurvy dealling,
told that such base way of detaining him prisoner was not the means to get
good quarters, beside the dishonor of it, Whereupon some words past betwixt
the Duke and him, upon his averring of the same, as they sat down to Supper,
he still telling him he would not adhere to any Treaty but die sooner, if he
could not otherwise escape, and that they would repent and quite their posts if
the Enemy did once approach. at last after diverse false alarmes that night,
toward the morning they had one for certain of the Enemies advance, which made
these mutiniers abandon the marketplace, returning some of the Earl of
Calanders horses, and arms unto his quarter, at which time the Duke being in
his naked bed, Calander took horse with some few Officers, and visited all the
posts; where there was yet no sight of the Enemy, after having told the Duke,
that he would upon no condition Capitulate, and that so often before, but
particularly when the Lord Kenmoore parted when it was also time for him to be
gone, as any judicious man may think, seeing the duke had Capitulate, and sent
out Ostages, and so with his Nephew the Lord Levingfton, and some others he
went away leaving the Duke to his Treaty, but as he came about a quarter of a
mile from the Town, he was told by certain Officers, and some Country people,
that order was given from some Officers at Utoxater to barricade the end of the
lane, whereby neither Officer nor Soldier might escape that way, and drawing
up those Troupers that came with him, he again told them as before he had done,
that all such as were ill mounted or had a mind to Capitulate, might return to
the Duke, and though he had no guide yet notwithstanding holding fast to his
first resolution he would take his hazard, and then riding on with the number
of sixscore horse or thereabout, Himself took the charge of one third part,
giving another to the Lord Levingstoun, and the third to be commanded by
Colonel Keyth, brother to the Earl Marshall, past through Asburn, intending
to follow Sir Marmaduck Langdall; but there he was informed of his disbanding
of his people, and marching on further, came amongst hills, where the Country
people rose in arms upon him, and there by reason many horses lost their
shoes with so long marching, diverse were taken prisoners, Colonel Keyth with
the first, by some of the troops of Darby, but marching on still toward
Chesterfield, about the evening being within a mile and a half of the Town,
intending to have past through it, and there halting to know whether there were
any of the Enemy quartered, night fell on, and the Country all about, firing
to give notice of us, we were informed that some troops were come there, and
before we could get on horseback, a party of foot fell upon us, which we
repulsed killing some, and so marched away, (it being very dark) to the right
hand toward Bolsover, the Lord Levingstoun having the Rear, with Major Drummond
and other Officers before we came near Bolsover lost their way, we then halting
upon a heath, and missing them, being very few in number, our horses extremely
wearied, the Earl of Calander marched back a mile, to see if he could learn
any thing of them, whom not finding, (and it being very rainie weather) he
intended notwithstanding (if he could) to march to Pomfret. But being misled by
the guide he then had, those few Officers which were remaining, as soon as it
was day, (the Country being full of the enemies Troops;) thought it fittest
every man to shift for himself, and so we parted, recommending one another to
the protection of God, and I took my own way, not doubting but that same
providence which had brought me so far in an Unfortunate journey, would yet
bring me out of danger, bnt what befell me in my taking afterward, and my
prison, (from which I am now by the grace of God got free) before I found Scots
ground to go upon, Shall be the Subject of your next entertaynment.

And now, to conclude all our misfortunes, and end this tedious discourse, I
shall briefly tell you, that after all the difficulties, oppositions, and
delays, in the levying of the Army in Scotland, our slow march at our entry
into England, wanting provision, and waiting for the cannon and ammunition, the
not joining of the Forces from Ireland, and the Dukes falling short of Preston,
(giving the enemy a fair opportunity to fall in betwixt the horse and the foot)
then the leaving of the ammunition, was the loss of the foot, the tampering to
Capitulate discouraged the horsemen, and the Dukes design to treat, after so
many great oversights, together with the mutiny at Utoxater, lost the horse
shamefully, when they might have been saved to recover a new Army of foot
again; And thus craving you pardon for my prolixity, and detaining you so long
in a discourse which could not be contracted in fewer words, when the full and
plain Truth was to be told, I here take my leave, what rests concerning my
self, and our other Friends, you shall hear at another occasion from,

Your Servant.
Edinburgh, 2 of October.
