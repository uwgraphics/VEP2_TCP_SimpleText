OSSORY.

WHEREAS the Parliament stands prorogued until the fourth day of July next: And
whereas for sundry causes and considerations, We have thought it fit and
convenient, and necessary further to prorogue the said Parliament until the
third day of August next; We do therefore will and require all persons to whom
it does or shall appertain, to take due notice thereof; to the end that in the
mean time they may repair to their houses, or otherwise apply themselves about
their private affairs at their pleasures; and then give their attendance here
again, at the day and time aforesaid, in the usual place appointed for that
intended service, whereof they may not fail.

Given at the Council Chamber in Dublin, the two and twentieth day of June,
1665.
