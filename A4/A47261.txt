An ABSTRACT of a PROPOSAL Already laid before the Honorable The House of
Commons Assembled in Parliament, FOR Employing our Poor, AND PREVENTING The
Exportation of our Coin.
THat the Moneys now collected throughout England and Wales, for the
Maintenance of the Poor in Idleness, be settled in the Hands of such Trustees
as this Honorable House shall appoint, to be a Fund to employ, them able, in
the Linen or other Foreign Manufactures, or such Manufactures or Employments
of our own that are not in a flourishing Condition; and to maintain all such
who are or shall from Time to Time become chargeable to their Parishes.

That it ought speedily to be done, whilst Linnens are near double the Value as
they used to be at in Time of Peace; and we (as well as the Germans, Spanish,
Portuguees, Dutch, etc.) make use of such Advantages as God and Nature, and the
present Juncture does afford us;

Whereby we shall be able to work cheaper than any of our Neighbors, all the
Poor's Labor being clear Profit; for the same Money that maintains them now in
Idleness will do it much better when employed and in a Community.

By which means we may be some Millions yearly Gainers, near Fifteen Hundred
Thousand Pounds per Annum being paid in Specie to the French alone, in Time of
Peace, by this Kingdom, for their Linen Manufactures, to be here expended, or,
by us, sent to other Countries; which Alteration will, at least, annually save
the Exportation of so much of our Coin or Bullion: And that only by setting the
Poor to Work, without other Charge than what now maintains them in Idleness.

All which at large is ready to be again laid before this Honorable House,
when they shall think fit, by Dixcy Kent.
