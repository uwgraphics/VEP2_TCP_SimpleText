A LETTER FROM A MEMBER of the ARMY, TO THE Committee of Safety, and Council
of Officers of the Army, etc.
Dear Friends,
WHom the Lord has yet spared, as a Remnant amongst thousands, and has not
spared many before you, who brought not forth fruits worthy of those
extraordinary kindnesses and mercies that have been received from the hands of
our loving God, whose intents was not hereby, and in overturning many, and
sparing you, that you should lust after what they lusted, nor set up your
selves as others before you did, by making your selves great, rich, and
honorable in this world; nor flatter one another, as others did with the titles
of the Heathen, who professed that which you do, nor to be friends to the Saints
of the most High, as you profess your selves to be, and are reserved as a
handful for the setting up of truth, righteousness, justice, and mercy, in
these Nations; and for the preservation and protection of just men, from all
violence and injury which hitherto you have not done: and one ground wherefore
you so pleaded, was, because you wanted power; your plea in that is void, and
the Lord has overturned once more that you might have power; now is your
trial come again; its not your words (any more then those that are gone
before) that will satisfy. Your adversaries in Scotland, and elsewhere, have
learnt fair words, and glorious pretenses: your words without fruits are vain;
yet is our hearts more inclined to hearken to you, because w^ know theirs many
among you have a great love to Gods people, and true desires begot in some to
do well, if you would not hearken to your home-councellors that stifles before
brought forth; the door is yet open to you, that ye may return, wash, and be
clean; now think with your selves, while ye are seeking to please the world,
by upholding of those things that they love, as lordly Titles, whereby the
children of this world love to please and flatter one another, with Humble
Servant, Excellency, Highness, Honor, Worship, and the like, when they are
the Devils servants, and would destroy one another for earth and titles, having
not truth in the heart: neither do you imitate the Heathen in their foolish
habits, Behaviors, Customs, Oppression, Pride, Lightness, Scoffing, and the
like, with curious fine words whereby many simple hearts are deceived: for if
herein you be found the same men many were under OLIVER, RICHARD, and the late
PARLIAMENT; and little alteration or change wrought in you, whereby you come to
see the vanity of what you have been, as to your old Conversations; if here you
stand, and come not to witness a Change from what you were, that the mind,
and will of our God, you may know, and do that to all whom God has set you
over as Rulers, you become savoury, in all meekness, self-denial, and
lowliness of mind, as becomes those whom make mention of his Name, in that
which is truly Virtuous, Excellent, Noble, rightly, and truly Honorable, that
in the reality you may be, not puffed up with what you are not, that to our God
you may give praise, who makes to differ, that your praise may be of God, and
not of men, who gives every good and perfect gift; praises to him. And the
blessing is upon them which seeks the Honor of God, and not its one: in the
world there are many Lords, and Gods, but we, who in measure, are not of the
world, have but one God, and Lord, Ephesians. 4.6.

And happy shall you be, if faithful to the Lord for then shall his work
prosper in your hands, and peace, and settlement shall attend you, and
wonderful shall the Lord appear amongst you, as of old, and Nations shall bow
before you; but if still you remain in the nature which promises liberty to
others, and you your selves servants to sin, and corruption, then will not you
be accounted worthy, for the bringing forth of those glorious things, that you
your selves promise, and thousands of your dear friends expects: and loath are
we to see you, whom the Lord has so often tried, and visited by his love, to
be made as a thing of naught, even as others before you, through their own
fearfulness: for how should you, if you yet flatter the lying Hirelings of
this Nation, by your personal confirmity to them, and their Mother, their two
blind eyes, and offspring of filth, the two Universities, so called, from
whence they have learned a trade to deceive, lie, dissemble, and commit all
manner of wickedness, where they have their degrees of Master-ship? O the
stinck that arises from them, is reached up to Heaven, and cries for vengeance,
and they are come with all their train of stareliness, in remembrance before
the Lord; and just is he that judges the issuings out of these two filthy
Wells; and happy are they who take part with the Lord, (who cries Vengeance,
Woes, and Plagues, which has been brought forth from thence) to raise her
foundation, and lay her waste, for all her wisdom is foolishness, and with it
the Prince of this World has always crucified by it the Lord of Life; and the
Prince of this World rules there, and makes men wise to their own destruction;
its known, and felt; and Schools we need not to learn our Children Blasphemy,
Pride, Covetousness, Lordlinesse, with cunning Witchcraft; for they are apt
enough to learn such things without being trained up to them, though learning
(in its place) we own: but these are not Christ's Schools, nor fit men, or
persons for him, and his work, but rather to Scourge, Whip, and persecute his
Servants, who are made Ministers not by Man, nor men's arts, by cunning craft.
Now if these things be kept up, the Woes and Vengeance of God will pursue the
upholders, yea verily, will root out those that may root out Iniquity, and will
not; this shall be known. Therefore beware what ye do, that establishment ye
may come to, the way, is for your selves to be established in that which
changes not, out of the transgression, then shall you establish that in the
earth which shall stand, and be firm unto which Truth shall say Amen to you,
and your work; and all Nations, and Powers, that lift themselves up against the
established in the Power of the Lord, shall be dashed in pieces, and come to
naught, the Lord God of Hosts has spoken it; then shall you come to know the
true right, honor, and those that fear the Lord, will be highly in esteem
with you; and God, then of a truth, shall dwell amongst you, and delight to do
you good; and a terour to all about you, shall you be: herein have I expressed my
love to you, as my dear friends, whom I would not have to perish, even as the
Lord has declared to me, I have declared to you, what was required of me,
without fear of the dispeasure of any.

Therefore my dear friends, prize your time, and examine your hearts, that you
may know what is the good, and acceptable will of our God, to do it, that we
may all with hand, and heart, go along with you, and help to carry on the
Lords work, that over all he may rule, whose right it is, and you in him a
terror may be to all ungodliness, and unrighteousness of men, who hold the
truth in unrighteousness, and a praise to those that do well.

And Friends, now does the blood and sufferings of the Lords dear Ones, which
you profess to be friends to, lay at your doors, you having power, and has
been laid before others in Authority, but they regarded not; therefore did not
the Lord regard them: and now if you make a confederation with those that has
drunk the blood of the Saints, spoiled their goods, and inhumanely, and
barbarously has used them, and not make strict inquisity, that Justice may be
done upon the impenitent, and hard-hearted: Then will the Lord charge it upon
you, and will not hold you guiltless who countenance these that are guilty of
Blood, Oppression, and Injustice (...) Then shall you not prosper, ^or be clear
before the Lord, till you have acquitted your selves of all the blood, and
sufferings of his People, that the Lord may acquit you, and his People have
cause to say, you are partakers with the Blood-suckers, by wincking at their
Iniquities. I have discharged my self before the Lord, in love to you all what
is required of me; and if you will be partakers of their Sins, of their
Plagues you must have part, in that which alters not. I wish you well.

Given forth the 8th. day, of the 9th. Month. From a Member of the Army, who
wishes them well, but a witness in measure, against all deceit therein, JOHN
HODGSON.

THE END.
