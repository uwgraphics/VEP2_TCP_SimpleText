THE Loyal Soldiers Courtship; OR, Constant PEGGY'S Kind Answer.
BEING Her Resolution to Forsake her Friends, and venture to the Wars with her
Beloved Soldier.
To a Pleasant New Tune.
Licensed according to Order.





UPon the Banks of Ireland,
when first we Landed there,
So cold was then our Lodging,
yet harder was our Fare;
For want of Meat and Drink, Sir,
our Men did pine and dye,
And I will no more go
into Dundaugh Camp to lie.
O come away, sweet Peggy,
and hear what I shall say,
We must for famous England,
there to receive our Pay:
Now for thy constant kindness,
I will love thee till I dye,
And I will no more go
into Dundaugh Camp to lie.
I'l^ take thee cross the Ocean,
unto my native Land,
And study thy Promotion,
then don't disputing stand;
These Arms shall still Embrace thee,
in Love and Constancy;
And I will no more go
into Dundaugh Camp to lie.


Sweet Soldier, since you Wooed me,
my Friends have made a noise,
Then do not thus delude me,
with such fine Golden Ioys,
For fear of Parents anger,
your Suit I must deny,
Although you will no more go
into Dundaugh Camp to lie.
What need you fear your Father
or Mothers angry Frowns?
My Hand and Sword shall Guard you
through Cities, Courts and Towns:
For thee, my dearest Jewel,
I Will Fight until I dye;
And Love, I will no more go
into Dandaugh Camp to lie.
But Soldier, should you leave me,
when you anoth^r find,
This would perplex and grieve me,
should you prove so unkind:
Therefore I Am loath to v^nter,
your Suit I must deny;
Although you do no more go
into Dundaugh Camp to lie.
I cannot be so Cruel,
while I rema^n alive,
If I am false, sweet Jewel,
there never let me thrive:
I never will deceive thee,
but love thee till I dye;
Yet now I will no more go
into Dundaugh Camp to lie.
Soldier, as thou art Loyal,
what e're become of me,
I Will make no more denial,
but through the World with thee:
My Fortune I will venture,
whether I live or dye,
The Field of Mars I Will enter,
where we in Camp will lie.
I Will leave my fond Relations,
my Parents dear also,
And unto Foreign Nations,
along with thee I Will go:
A Masquer on my shoulder,
I Will bear right valiantly;
Thus as a fellow-Souldier,
with thee I Will live and dye.
Let Us go on Board together,
to Plow the Ocean Main,
I fear no Wind nor Weather,
Love, with the Warlike Train,
In France or famous Flanders,
where e're thy lot shall be,
Under those brave Commanders,
I Will live and dye with thee.
