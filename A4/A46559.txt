By the King, A PROCLAMATION For Prohibiting the Transportation of Frames for
Knitting and Making of Silk-Stockings, and other Wearing Necessaries.
JAMES R.

Whereas a very useful and profitable Invention was lately found out, for the
better and more speedy Making and Knitting of Silk-stockings, and other
VVearing Necessaries, in a Frame, whereby great Quantities are Wrought off in a
little time, His Majesty's Own Dominions abundantly supplied, and the rest
Exported into Foreign Nations, to the increase of His Majesty's Customs, and
the improvement of Trade and Commerce: And whereas Our Dearly beloved Brother,
for the better Encouragement of those who use the said Art and Mystery, was
Graciously pleased to Incorporate them by His Royal Charter, by the Name of
Master, Wardens and Assistants of the Society of Frame-work-knitters of His
Majesty's Cities of London and Westminster, and of the Kingdom of England and
Dominion of Wales; And upon the Humble Petition of the said Master, Wardens
and Assistants, representing to him the great Mischiefs and irreparable Damage
which would inevitably fall upon His Subjects by the loss of so great a Trade
and Mystery, by reason that several Merchant-Strangers and Foreigners were
laboring to Purchase Frames to convey them to some secret places near the
Seacoast, for their better and more easy Transportation, His said Majesty, by
His Royal Proclamation, bearing date the Fifteenth day of January in the
Seventeenth year of His Reign, did strictly prohibit the Transportation of the
said New Invented Frames, or any parcel thereof beyond the Seas; And We being
informed thereof by the Humble Petition of the said Master, Wardens and
Assistants, praying that We would be Graciously pleased, for preservation of
so Considerable a Trade and Mystery within this Our Kingdom, to issue forth Our
Royal Proclamation for the same purposes; We, by the Advice of Our Privy
Council, have thought fit to declare Our Royal Will and Pleasure to be, and
We do hereby straightly Charge and Command all and every of Our Subjects, as
well Natives as Foreigners, that they presume not to Transport or cause to be
Transported any of the said New Invented Frames, or any pieces or parcels of
Frames, nor to be Aiding or Assisting to any Person or Persons who shall
endeavor to Transport the same, as they will answer the contrary at their
utmost Perils. And, for the better hindrance and prevention of the
Transportation of such Frames, and pieces or parcels of Frames, We do further
hereby straightly Charge and Command, That no Frames or pieces or parcels of
Frames, shall be bought, sold, or removed by any Person or Persons whatsoever,
from place to place, without information thereof be first given to the Master,
Wardens and Assistants of the said Company of Frame-work knitters, or any
three of them, or their Deputies, to the intent they may take Cognizance where
and in whose hands they be. And, that Our Will and Pleasure herein declared,
may be the better observed and executed, We do further straightly Charge and
Command all Customers, Comptrollers, Searchers, VVaiters, and other Officers
and Ministers whatsoever, attending in any of Our ports, that they do from time
to time cause diligent and strict Search and Enquiry to be made for all such
Frames, and pieces and parcels of Frames, as shall be endeavored to be
Transported, and the same to seize and detein, under pain of forfeiting their
respective Places and Employments, in case they should be found negligent or
remiss in the execution of these Our Commands. And We do further Charge and
Command all Mayors, Sheriffs, Justices of the Peace, Constables, and all other
Officers, Civil and Military whatsoever, that they be Aiding and Assisting from
time to time unto the said Master, Wardens, and Assistants, or their Deputies,
in the Searching for all such Frames, and pieces and parcels of such Frames, as
shall be endeavored to be Transported, or shall be brought unto any place near
the Sea Coasts, with intention to Transport the same, or shall be removed from
place to place contrary to Our Pleasure herein before declared, and in causing
the same to be seized and detained: And that they do from time to time Certify
unto the Lords of Our Privy Council, the Names of all such Persons whom they
shall find to be Offenders against this Our Proclamation, to the End that there
may be such further Proceedings against them, as shall be agreeable to the
utmost Severity of the Law in such Cases.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall the Twenty fourth Day of October 1686. in the
Second Year of Our Reign.
