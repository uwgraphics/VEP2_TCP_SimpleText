coming toward the CITY of LONDON.
TO unperplex the Riddles of our State,
And to discover t'us our hidden part,
Welcome (we cry) Welcome to George the Great,
A joyful sight to see.
Not like the Macedons impatient sword,
That solved the doubt tied in the Gordean Cord,
Great George does time proportion due afford,
A joyful, etc.
Wisdoms great pattern bred at Bellones Breast,
Prudence and Valor joined in one Rest,
No more St. George shall be but George the Blessed,
A joyful, etc.
As Caesar did the affrighted Boat-man learn,
When he sat trembling at the stinking stern,
My fates Embarked that does the world concern,
A joyful, etc.
So the wrack't Vessel of the state distressed,
With Heavens angry blasts, now seeks for rest,
From the Favonian Gales of George o'th West,
A joyful, etc.
His great excelling merits in the Scale,
Of our raised hope, nor shall the angry Tail,
Of any Comet against our peace prevail,
A joyful, etc.
Another Fabius, whose wise delays,
(Like a misty morn, guilt with the Suns noond-rayes)
Have Crowned him with the Glorious Bays,
A joyful, etc.
He that has marched quite three Kingdoms over,
subdued his great mind for to make them four,
The signs to bring peace and plenty to our Door,
A joyful etc.
Let all ancient Glory then be a Romance,
Let old fame, and crazed Time, lie in a Trance,
Nothing new but Honey Soit qui mal y pense,
A joyful, etc.
This is the Noble Champion of the Garter,
The great Defender of the Magna Charter,
The sovereign good come from the Northern Quarter
A joyful, etc.
To settle a Nation without any Blows,
To break down the Fridge of another Nose,
To do what all wish, but no body Knows.
A joyful, etc.
To complete a Design without any Noise.
To amuse the Loud cry of Vive le Roys,
And sport all a long with your Commonwealth toys,
A joyful, etc.
But all the grand Hero's and wise ones together,
None had such advantage of Wine and Weather,
It Is true he is sprung of a Princely Feather,
A joyful, etc.
Where shall we begin his Trophies to raise?
Or when shall we make an end of his praise?
The blessing and honor and joy of these days.
A joyful, etc.
The untamed Scot (before his glorious time)
Has made t'expiate their treacherous crime,
They own him sole conqueror of that clime,
A joyful, etc.
His great and most powerful Influence,
Has restraind them in their obedience,
As if they owned the Viceroy of their Prince,
A joyful etc.
The shifting Irish bey'd his great command,
The slaughtered Dutch, yet rolling on the sand,
Crave a reflux, to keep them from his hand,
A joyful, etc.
Thrice did he Victory over them repeat,
And the a'most wearied State were forced to treat,
To save them from a final last defeat,
A joyful, etc.
Whether we conque'rd are, or must submit,
By his all-powerful hand to them that sit,
We are sure to be eased of our present fit,
A joyful, etc.
What if great George should come to the City,
And in all your good humors should presently fit ye,
As I hope he will do; else more is the pity,
A joyful sight to see.
