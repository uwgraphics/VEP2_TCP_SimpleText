easy, and pleasant learning and retaining of it in memory.

OR, A summary Abstract of Divine Knowledge, as far as is necessary to
SALVATION.

Intended for the benefit of all, and especially for the Education of Youth, in
the Knowledge and Fear of God.

By WALTER FRANK, Minister of Gods Word.

John 5. 39. Search the Scriptures, for in them ye have eternal life, and they
are they which testify of me. LONDON, Printed by J. G. for Francis
Eaglesfield, at the Marigold in St. Paul's Churchyard, 1655.

To the Right Worshipful, and Virtuous Lady, the Lady ANNE BASSET; and to the
like Virtuous and Religious Gentlewom^n, Mrs. Jane, and Mrs. Elizabeth Basset.
Honored Ladies, I am not ignorant that ingratitude is a sin of an high
nature, and none more base and monstrous; lest therefore I should seem to you,
guilty of that crime, which I have always in my heart so much abhorred; I have
now taken an opportunity to express my thankfulness, for the manifold favors
and benefits, which (in the depth of my afflictions) I have received from you.
And no other way have I really to express it, but by the dedication of this
little Book to your Ladyships acceptance: which if you shall condescend to
patronize, (as your former respects unto me, makes me confident you will) I
shall rather increase, than any way lessen my engagements to you. The structure
of it being so small and low, may in the eyes of some seem contemptible, in
respect of those large and fair buildings of like nature, that by others of
far richer endowments have been erected: yet as you have often seen the whole
world described in a little Map, or the lively portraicture of a tall Man or
Woman in a Shillings compass, so is here (although I must confess for the
manner, but rudely contrived) yet for the matter, the whole body of Divinity
contained in a small Epitome; which being so little and weak, as it has the
more need of succor, so it may with the more facility from your Ladyships
favor receive protection. I know you will take the pains often to peruse it
(because I am well assured, that each of you do spend some hours every day in
Religious duties) and perusing it, I doubt not but you will apply it, to the
edification and adorning of your own Souls, to Gods glory, and your own
eternal comfort: which that you may do, and daily increase in the knowledge
and grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, shall be the prayer of

Your most obliged Servant in the Lord, Walter Frank.

To the Reader.
COurteous and well-disposed Reader (if so thou art) it was the saying of him
who (by the Spirit of God himself) is said to be a man after Gods own heart,
even David that great King, and sweet singer of Israel; I have rejoiced in the
way of thy testimonies above all riches, Psalm. 119. 14. And again, Psalm. 19.
10. They are more to be desired than gold, yea, than much fine gold, sweeter
also than the Honey, or the Honey comb, with many such exp^essions of like
nature in the same Psalm. And will you know the reason of this his
transcendent esteem of them? you may then thus collect it. As in the whole
visible World, there is nothing of more excellency than Man, and in Man,
nothing more excellent than the Soul, and in the Soul, nothing more excellent
than the Understanding, and in the Understanding, nothing more excellent than
Wisdom; so most certain it is, that no Wisdom that the Understanding is
capable of, is so excellent as the Wisdom from above, or the Knowledge of
Divine things, which commonly we call Christian Divinity; for whether we have
respect to the Causes, the Effects, the Subjects, the Objects, the Adjuncts, or
the ends thereof, it far exceeds all the Arts, Sci^nces, Knowledge or Wisdom
that the World affords. The result therefore of all is, that it behooves every
man that aims at eternal happiness, not only most highly to est eme it, but
also in some good measure to attain unto it. And therefore gentle Reader,
although many have written diverse excellent and ample Volumes of the whole body
of Divinity, yet (as a mite cast into the treasury) I hope thou will accept of
this my weak endeavor, for thy Souls good, as an instrument conducing unto
that end. It is indeed, but as a little Infant in comparison with the tallest
Man; yet thou may discern, it has its full shape, as well as has the
greatest, and Scripture enough to prove it to be Legitimate, and therefore as I
do commend it to thy charitable censure (hoping thou will not despise it for
the smallest of its growth) so I do no less desire, that thou may fully
improve it to thy own advantage: and to this end, I could wish thou would
make it thy vade mecum, or thy pocket companion; that so in the end, by
committing it to memory, it may (to thy comfort) become thy bosom friend; or
as an hid treasury in thy heart, that may help to maintain thee in thy
journey to the Heavenly Jerusalem, that so although it be but little, yet (if
by a faithful application thou make much of it) at last thou may find it,
to grow great in thy Soul, to thy everlasting comfort: and therefore do not
only cast an eye upon it, and so lay it by, but take the pains to read it
through. It is but an hours labor, or a little more, deliberately to view it
over, which being done, if then thou like it, Quo animo legis observa, and
quo observas serva (as one says well) with what affection thou read it,
observe it, and with the same affection thou observest it, remember it, and
remember to practice it: and withal turn often to the Scriptures that (for
the confirmation of those truths) do stand in relation to each part of it;
which being often revolved in thy mind, will much advantage thee in the
knowledge of God, and of his revealed will. So God shall be glorified, thy
Understanding enlightened, thy Faith strengthened, and so consequently thy Soul
for ever comforted. And that so it may be, is, and shall be the prayer of him,
who is thy Souls true friend,

Walter Frank.

The Epitome of DIVINITY Poetically composed, etc.
1. The condition of a True Christian.
Quest. WHat is a Christian?

A. One that in Christ's name
Baptized Act. 8. 16. Act. 2. 38. Act. 11. 16.
, led by his grace Romans 8. 14, 15, 16.
, does through the same
Believe on him Mar. 16. 16. Joh. 3. 16.
, continue in his Word Act. 2. 42.
,
And to's example make his life accord Joh. 13. 15. Phil. 2. 5. 1 Pet 2. 21.
.

Q. Answer me then, are they not Christians all,
That are baptized, and live within the pale
Of Christ his Church?

A. No, they alone indeed
Are Christians, who of the immortal seed,
Are born again Joh. 3. 5. 1 Pet. 1. 23.
, as of the element,
That used is, in Baptismes sacrament,
For he that is Christ's scholar, (what the name
Of Christian does signify) the same Act. 22. 16. Ephesians. 5. 26.

Must be Gods child Gal. 3. 26, 27.
.

Q. Is It needful then to be
New born?

A. It is Joh 3. 3.
.

Q. The reason why lets see,

A. The reason is, man is by sin deformed Ephesians. 2. 1, 2.
,
The child of wrath by nature Ephesians. 2. 3.
, and reformed
Must therefore be Ephesians. 2. 5.
, and made the child of grace Ephesians. 2. 8
,
If he in heaven desires a biding place Matthew. 5. 3. Gal. 6. 16 Matthew. 25. 34
.

Q. Mankind in Adam was created good?

A. True Genesis 1. 26, 31.
, and might be so still had Adam stood Wisd. 2. 23. Eccles. 7. 31
.

2. Concerning the Fall of man^.
Q. How then became it sinful?

A. Through the fall
Of Adam Genesis 3. 6.
, by whom sin passed over all Romans 5. 12.
.

Q. How?

A. Adam as the head of whole mankind Genesis 3. 20.
,
What so ere gifts of body, or of mind,
He did in his creation from the grace
Of God receive Jam 1. 17.
, the same for his whole race
He had, as for himself Eccles. 7. 31.
, and therefore when
He lost them by his fall, all other men
Lost them in him; nor only so, but he
Being defiled by this transgression, we
That in his loins were hid, did then begin,
Though yet we had not being to have sin:
For being of the propagated mass
Begotten, all which then in Adam was,
And was in him by his first fault defiled,
It follows, that every succeeding child
Of his, must sinful be Romans 5. 12, 14.
, for who can bring
A clean stream from a foul and pudled spring Job 14. 4.
?

Q. Are all men sinners then?

A. Yes, there is none
Excepted Prove. 20. 9. 1 John 1. 8.
, but our Savior CHRIST alone 1 Pet. 2. 22. 1 John 3. 5.
.

Q. Sinners deserve death, and is death to all
Us due, for having sin original?

A. Only for this we do deserve to die,
Though we had else done none iniquity Romans 5. 12. and 6. 23.
:
But we do many ways offend besides Jam. 3. 6.
,
Because that Mother sin that still abides
In us Ps. 51. 6. Romans 7. 8.
, depraving both the mind, and will Romans 7. 13, 14, 15.
;
Breeds always, and brings forth some actual ill Jam. 1. 5.
:
And whatsoever we do, or think, or say,
Is sin Romans 3. 9, 10. Job 25. 4.
: and God therefore condemn us may Psalm. 51. 4. and 143. 2.
.

Q. How know we this, what is the rule whereby,
We do our actions, to be sinful try?

A. The Moral Law Romans 7. 7.
, divided into ten
Eternal precepts, Gods own Word, which when
Sinai was all on smoke, the air with thunder
Ratled, and lightning shone, that men did wonder,
And mountain quaked (the trumpet being sounded)
Was by JEHOVAH, in such sort propounded Exodus cap. 20.
.

3. The ten Commandments.
I am the Lord that made, and do command,
The heaven, the fire, the air, the sea, the land,
With all things in them Genesis cap. 1. Psalm. 89. 11
, yea thy God I am;
Thy Savior that from the land of Ham,
And house of bondage, did thee Israel bring See Exodus the 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 ^2.
chapters and Psalm. 106. 22.
,
By a strong Arm, and Power astonishing Psalm. 136. ^^.
.
I.
HAve thou no other Gods but me alone,
Whose might, and mercy, to thee have been shown Mat 4. 10.
.
II.
Make to thy self no image, carve, nor paint,
In heaven above, of Angel, or of Saint,
In sea of fish, in earth of any creature,
For a religious use, the fansied feature:
Neither shall thou serve it, nor it adore,
Though but with bodies bending, and no more Deuteronomy. 4. 15, to the 20. Act. 17.
29 Levit. 26. 1. Psalm. 97. 7.
.
For I JEHOVAH am a jealous God Exodus 34. 14. Nahum. 1. 2. Deuteronomy. 32. 21.
,
That do severely visit with my rod,
The fathers sins, on their posterity,
Extending to the third, and fourth degree
Of their succeeding issue, that me hate,
And for a god, an idol consecrate Lam. 5. 7.
:
But mercy show to them, and thousands more
Of them, that love me, and observe my lore Psalm. 128. 3, 6. Deuteronomy. 28. 4.
.
III.
My sacred name, or attributes forbear
To use irreverently, and do not swear
Falsely, or rashly by me Lev. 19. 12. Mat. 5. 33, 34.
, for excused
I Will hold him not, by whom my names abused Deuteronomy. 28. 58. to the end. Jen. 23.
10.
.
IV.
By pious works, and a religious rest,
Remember that thou keep my weekly feast,
The blessed Sabbath: Six days shall thou do,
What work soever thou art called unto:
But on the seventh, which is the Sabbath day,
Of God thy Lord, no work nor labor may
Be by thy self done, or allowed to be
Done, by thy salve, beast, guest, that is with thee Exodus 23. 12. Ezekiel. 20.
12. Isa. 58. 12, 13. Neh. 13. 15. to ver. 22.
:
For in six days, the Lord the heavens did frame,
The earth, the sea, with what is in the same;
But on the seventh day, he was pleased to rest;
And therefore has it sanctified and blessed Genesis 2. 1, 2.
.
V.
Honor thy parents, and observe with love
And reverence due those that are thee above Ephesians. 6. 1, 2. Exodus 21. 17. Col.
3. 20. Matthew 19. 19. Matthew. 15. 4.

In gifts 1 Timothy 5. 17.
, place Col. 3. 22.
, office Romans 13. 1. Eccles. 8. 2. 1 Pet. 2. 13. Prove. 24. 21.
, or whose love, and care,
Toward thee Genesis 45. 8. Job 31. 18.
, or whose age, make that they are
Fathers, or mothers, to thee, that thou live
Long, in the land, which to thee God shall give 1 Timothy 5. 1, 2. Levit. 19. 32.
.
VI.
Man's blood in cruelty thou shall not spill Genesis 9. 5, 6.
,
Nor shall in malice seek Mat. 5. 22. Ephesians. 4. 31. 1 Cor. 14: 21. 1 Pet. 2. 1.
or wish his ill 1 Pet. 3. 9.
.
VII.
Do not by carnal acts Ephesians. 5. 3. Heb. 13. 4.
, or lusts most vile,
Thy own or others purity defile 2 Samuel 13. 4. Lev. 18. 6, 23. Romans 1. 24, 26,
27. Mat. 5. 28.
.
VIII.
Thy neighbors goods, by any unjust way,
Thou shall not to thy proper use convey Exodus 22. 1, 2, 3. Lev. 6. 2, 3.
.
IX.
By an abusive or a lying tongue,
Thy neighbor, or his fame, thou shall not wrong Ps. 15. 3. Prove. 6. 19. and
20. 19.
.
X.
Thy neighbors house, his wife, his servant, maid,
His beast, or other thing that may be said
His, must thou not lust after, neither must
Thou yield to, or be moved by any lust Luke 12. 15. 1 Timothy 6. 6. to the 11. to
see the hainousness and punishment of this sin, read 1 Kin. chapter 21.
.
This is Gods law, which who does not fulfill
In every jot and tittle, he does ill Deuteronomy. 5. 32. and 28. 15. to the end.
.

Q. What is the sum hereof?

A. This, thou shall love
The Lord thy God, who dwells above, above
All things; with all thy powers Mat. 22. 37.
, let neighbor be,
As thou art to thy self, so dear to thee Mat. 22. 39, 40.


4. No man is able to keep the Law.
Q. Is any man of power all this to do,
Which God in this his Law commands unto?

A. Not any man Eccles. 7. 22.
, not the most sanctified 2 Cor. 3. 5.
,
As does appear, being by this rule tried Gal. 3. 10
.

Q. Why then does God command what cannot be
Performed by any man?

A. Surely when he
Before the fall, did in man's mind engrave
The Law Romans 2. 15.
, strength to perform the same he gave Eccles. 7. 31.
;
Which since by his own fault he lost Genesis 3. 6
, God still
Justly requires obedience to his will Mie. 6. 9.
.
Besides though men not called, by no means can
In any point perform the Law Heb. 11. 6. Joh. 1. 5.
, that man
Who is new born, can it so far observe,
That though his works from that perfection swerve,
Which God in's righteous justice does expect 1 Ioh 3. 9. Luke 1. 6. Psalm. 119.
3.
,
Are yet so good, that he does them respect 2 Cor. 8. 12

In mercy for Christ's sake, who has supplied,
What he does want by having satisfied
On his behalf 1 Cor. 1. 30.
.

Q. But since in measure due
It cannot be performed, no not say you,
By the newborn themselves; speak what may be
The use thereof?

A. Its offices are three:
The one spiritual, 'cause it does pertain
To those, who by Gods Spirit are born again;
Whom it does teach, to worship God aright,
And walk precisely as in his pure sight Psalm 116. 1, to the end.
.
A second outward, serving to repress
The fear of punishment for wickedness,
Even of ungodly men, so far that they
Dare not break out, into what sins they may Romans 2. 14, 15. Mat. 21. 26.
.
A third more secret, when it sore affects
The conscience for sin, which it detecteth,
Reproves, condemns, and threatens punishment
Eternal, to be therefore consequent Romans 7. 7, to the 24. Genesis 4. 7. 13, 14.
Mat. 27. 4.
.

Q. After the Law has thus showed us our sin,
And miserable estate that we are in;
Does it not also show the remedy,
Vhereby to cure our sinful malady
And to prevent damnation?

A. No Romans 7. 11. 2 Cor. 3. 5.
, but this,
^erformed only by the Gospel is 1 Cor. 15. 1 to the 5. Ephesians. 1. 7. 1 Timothy 4.
9, 10. Tit. 2.
.

5. The knowledge of the Law leads us to embrace the Gospel.
Q. What is the Gospel?

A. It Is Gods heavenly Word Luke 2. 10, 11.
,
Promised to the fathers, by Gods Son our Lord Heb. 1. 1.
,
And his Apostles Mat. 4. 18, 19. Heb. 1. 2.
, men inspired by
His blessed Spirit, declared perfectly Act. 2. 3, 4. 2 Pet. 1. 21.
,
Bringing the joyful news that by the Son
Of God procured is redemption
For all mankind 2 Timothy 3. 16. 1 Timothy 2. 6. 1 Pet. 1. 18, 19, 20.
(so that they will amend Mat. 3. 2.
,
And will believe 1 Pet. 1. 21.
) life, bliss without an end Tit. 1. 2. Joh. 10. 28.
.

Q. What is the Gospels subject?

A. Christ 1 Cor. 3. 11. Mat. 13. 44, and 46. 1 Timothy 3. 16.
.

Q. Is he
Ordained by God, the remedy to be,
For sinful man?

A. He is 1 Thessalonians. 5. 9.
; and there is none
That has salvation wrought but he alone Acts 4. 11, 12.
.

Q. To know Christ then is it necessary?

A. Yes:
For to know God, and Christ, is happiness Joh. 17. 3.
.

Q. What Is God?

A. One essence pure Deuteronomy. 6. 4. Exodus 3. 14.
, in persons three
Father, Son, holy Ghost 1 John 5. 17. Mat. 3. 16, 17.
, who though they be
Distinct in properties, (as do imply
Their several names Ephesians 4. 6. Joh. 1. 14. Romans 8. 16.
) agree in unity
Of nature 1 John 5. 7.
, being one 1 Cor 8. 4.
, great Psalm. 139. 7. Isa. 66. 1.
, infinite Psalm. 90. 2.
,
In wisdom Romans 11. 33.
, power Phil. 3. 21.
, goodness Exodus 34. 6.
, blessed Sprite 1 Timothy 1. 11.
.

Q. Suffices it for man God thus to know,
As he is in himself consid'red?

A. No Joh. 4. 24.
:
But it is chiefly needful to salvation,
That we do know God, as he has relation
Toward us 1 Cor. 8. 2, 3.
, which is, when we understand
Aright in God, his perfect justice, and
His perfect mercy 1 Cor. 8. 5, 6. 1 John 2. 5. Psalm. 85. 10.
.

Q. Speak then, what are they?

A. Not qualities, for that is most false to say;
But God his justice, is his nature Psalm. 48. 10. Deuteronomy. 32. 4.
, as
It hates all evil, nor lets any pass
Unpunisht Exodus 20. 5.
: mercy is the same, as it
Gives freely to us, every benefit
We do enjoy Psalm. 36. 5, 7. Tit. 3. 5. Exodus 20. 5.
.

Q. But when especially
Appeared this mercy?

A. When God graciously Ephesians. 2. 4, 5, 6.

Gave us his Christ Joh. 3. 16.
, who is the sum, and chief
Of all Gods benefits, the souls relief 1 John 3. 7.
:
And whom it is most needful that we know,
The reason why, I did but lately show.

6. What must be known concerning Christ.
Q What must be known concerning Christ?

A. What do
Concern his person, and his office too Joh 1. 1, to the 15. Gal. 4 4. Phil. 2.
6, 7.
.

Q Touching his person, what is he?

A. Gods Son Mat. 3. 17. Luke 1. 35. Joh. 1. 14, 18.

Who by a sacred, secret union
Has joined our nature to his deity,
In one admired, blessed, subsistency Col. 2. 9. 2. Pet. 1. 4. Ioh 17. 21. Heb.
2. 11.
:
And so is God, and man, and yet but one
Person, one Christ, and but one God alone 1 Cor. 8 6. 1 Timothy 2. 5.
*

Q. But was it needful that who mankind should
Redeem be God Almighty, neither could
Any nor all the creatures this effect?

A. Undoubtedly they could not in respect
Both of the evils great which damnifi'd
Us, and the great good things which none beside
God could restore unto us 1 Pet. 1. 18 19, 20.
.

Q. Them great evils,
What are they tell?

A. Sins heavy weight 1 Cor. 15 56.
, the devils
Base tyranny 2 Timothy 2. 26.
, death's conquest, and the sense
Of Gods just wrath conceived against man's offense Col. 3. 6. Ephesians. 2. 3.
;
Which for to take away Ioh. 1 29. 1 Ioh. 2 1, 2.
, subdue, confound,
And pacify, no creature could be found,
But God must do it Heb. 2. 14. 1 Ioh. 3. 8.
.

Q Say what good things are
Restored unto us?

A. What sin once did mar,
And did in our first parents quite deface Romans 5. 15. to the end.
,
Wisdom, true holiness, and every grace 1 Cor. 1. 30.
,
Whereby Gods image is in us reformed Ephesians. 4. 23, 24. 2 Cor. 15. 49.
;
Now this could not be, but by God performed 2 Ephesians. 4, to the 11.
.

Q. God is omnipotent, and all things can,
Was It needful then, that God should become man
To save mankind?

A. Though in his power he
Could save by other means, it did agree
Best with his justice, us so to redeem Heb. 2. 10, 14.
,
Because man having sinned, it does seem
Most just, that man should make amends Rom 8. 3, 4.
, and by
That nature that offended satisfy
Almighty God Gal. 3. 13.
.

Q. But answer, whether might
Not God the Father, nor the blessed Sprite
Act the Redeemers part, incarnate be,
As God the Son?

A. They might, but Gods decree
Ordained before that mankindes reparation,
Should be by him Isa. 9. 6, 7. Gal. 4. 4.
, by whom was its creation Ioh. 1. 3.
.

Q. Of Christ himself this to have said suffices:
What is his office?

A. That he exercises,
According to both natures, as he is Christ Romans 9. 5. 1 Timothy 3. 16. Romans 1. 2,
3.
,
Or our anointed King Rev. 19. 16.
, Prophet Deuteronomy. 18. 15.
, and Priest Psalm. 110. 4.
.

7. Christ's threefold Office.
Q. What is his Regal office?

A. That whereby
He rules all things, but especially,
His Church Jer. 23. 5. Luke 1. 33.
, which he defends Jer. 23. 6.
, endows with graces
Here Ephesians. 4. 8.
; and does glorify in heavenly places Joh. 10. 28.
.

Q. What are the parts hereof?

A. The parts I name,
A calling by the Word Hag. 2. 7. Heb. 4. 12.
, and by the same
A judging, that is either general,
When he does all men generally call Mat. 22. 9, 10. 1 Cor. 1. 9.
;
And does invite 2 Thessalonians. 11. 12.
to faith, by his Word's preaching Romans 10. 17. 1 Thessalonians. 2. 13.
,
Or specially, when unto the outward teaching 2 Timothy 1. 9.
,
He joins his spirits working, and inflecteth
The mind, that it believes, and affects
Gods Word 1 John 5. 6, 10. Romans 8. 11, to 16.
; And this does not to all belong,
As does the outward calling of the tongue Mat. 22. 3, and 8 verses, and 11. to
the 15.

But to Gods chosen only, these alone
Are called effectually, not every one Romans 8. 30. Romans 9. 11, 12, 13.
.
The other part of Christ his Office royal,
Is that whereby, he does on his disloyal
Subjects, the wicked, punishments inflict
In this life Psalm. 2, 9. and 110. 1, 2.
, and when after by his strict
Justice, he has before his Judgment Seat,
Summoned, arraigned, condemned them in his great
And dreadful indignation; he them sends
Thence into Hell, where torment never ends Mat. 22. 11, 12, 13. and 8. 12.
and 25. 41.
.
But those who are his servants, his elect,
He does against his enemies protect Joh. 16. 33. Romans 16. 20.
,
Acquit them of their sins, in the last day Romans 8. 32. to the end.
,
And them reward even with an heavenly pay Mat. 25. 34.
.

Q. How was a Prophets Office, by our Lord
Christ executed?

A. When he by his Word Col. 3. 16.
,
His Spirit Luke 24. 45.
, Sacraments Mat. 26. 26, 27, 28. and 28. 20.
, himself Heb. 1. ^ Mat. 28 20.
, and his
Ordained Ministers Act. 5. 20, 21. Mat. 2^ (...). 20.
, made known what is
The Gospel, or his heavenly Fathers mind,
Concerning the redemption of mankind Romans 1. 1, 2, 3, 4.
.

Q. What is his Priestly Office?

A. That whereby,
He did Gods wrath, against us pacify 1 Thessalonians. 1. 10. Heb. 5. 8, 9, 10.
;
And put himself, a gracious Mediator,
'Twixt sinful man, and God his just Creator 1 Timothy 2. 5. Heb. 7. 24, 25. 1 John 2. 1, 2.
.

Q. What are the parts hereof?

A. Two: satisfaction,
When he the Law fulfilled in holy action Mat. 3. 15. and 5. 17.
,
And gave his life as a redeeming price
For us Mat. 20. 28. 1 Timothy 2. 6.
, and made himself a sacrifice
For sin Heb. 9. 11. to the end.
upon the Cross Mat. 27. 24, 26. 1 Pet. 2. 24.
; and intercession Romans 8. 34. Hebr. 7. 25.
;
Whereby now standing in the full possession
Of glory Phil. 2. 9, 10. Heb. 7. 25.
; he desires, his offering may
Prevail with God, for his elect Joh. 17. 9, to the end.
, and they
May have their suits, and prayers granted still Joh. 16. 23, 24, 26, 27.
,
When they are made according to his will 1 Ioh. 5. 14, 15.
.

Q. Of CHRIST his Person, and his Office both,
Is said enough, and now it plainly does
Appear, how CHRIST is made our remedy:
But remedies though made, if none apply
Them to the patient, do not heal, show then,
How CHRIST applied is to us, and when.

8. How Christ is made ours.
A. He is applied, made ours, this way alone;
By being joined with us, and made one Heb. 3. 15. Ioh. 17. 21, 22, 23.
.

Q. How, speak wherein this union does consist?

A. In this, that we remain and live in Christ,
And he in us, that each is held possessed
Of other, by a special interest 1 Cor. 1. 9. Ioh. 14. 19, 20. Gal. 2. 20.
:
So that we are his branches Ioh. 15. 5.
, and his wife Hos. 2. 19, 20.
,
His parts 1 Cor. 12. 27.
, and draw to us, growth Col. 2. 19.
, gifts Ephesians. 4. 7, 8.
, and life Ioh. 6. 47, 48.
;
From him our vine Ioh. 15. 1.
, our husband Cant. 4. 8, 16.
, and our head 1 Cor. 11. 3.
,
By which we grow, prosper, and are quickened Ephesians. 2. 5.
:
And he does take on him by imputation,
Our sins 2 Cor. 5. 21.
, and bears our woes, by his compassion 1 Pet. 2. 24. Heb. 4. 15.
.

Q. What is it that we by this union have?

A. What thing soever needful is to save Romans 8. 32. 2 Pet. 1. 3.
,
Whole Christ himself 2 Pet. 1. 4. Heb. 2 14. Ephesians. 5. 30. 1 Cor. 6. 17.
, his merits, every good,
Which the blessed virtue of his flesh and blood
May yield 1 Cor. 1. 30, Romans 8. 32.
.

Q. What are the parts of it?

A. I call
The parts these, imputation, and real,
Or an habitual infusion:
The first is when, what Christ in's passion
Suffered, and acted by his holiness;
Imputed is to us, for righteousness 2 Cor. 5. 21.
.
The second when, grace in some measure, is
Bestowed here Ephesians. 4. 7. 1 Pet. 5. 10
, but plenteously in bliss 1 Cor. 13. 9, 10, 12.
.

Q. What is this unions bond, the sacred tie,
That Christ and us conjoyneth mutually?

A. The Holy Ghost 1 Cor. 12. 3.
; for as the members be
All knit unto the head by nerves, so he,
By his internal operation, knits
Us unto Christ, with all his benefits 1 Cor. 1. 30. and 12. 12, 13.
.

Q. Does not he work this by some instruments?

9. The means of our unity Ioh. 1. 12. Phil. 3. 9.
to Christ.
A. Yes: these, our faith, Gods word Romans 10. 17.
, and sacraments Rom 6. 3, 4, 5, 6. 1 Cor. 10. 16, 17.
.

Q. By faith how?

A. Faith he gives Phil. 1. 29. Matthew. 16. 17.
, and so does make
Us able, of Christ Jesus to partake Ephesians. 3. 17. Ioh. 1. 12.
:
For faith is to the soul, an hand extended,
Whereby Christ (though above) is apprehended,
And brought home to it 1 Pet. 1. 7, 8, 9. Romans 1. 16, 17. and 5. 1, 2.
.

Q. How do you define
This faith?

A. It is a quality divine Phil 1. 29. Heb. 11. 1. Mat. 16. 17.
,
By which we know and do assent unto
Gods word Joh. 2. 22.
and promises in Christ, and do
Confide therein Romans 4. 16, to 21.
, and know most certainly Job 19. 25, 26, 27.

That God in Christ does love us graciously Joh. 3. 16, 17.
.

Q. Who is the author of this faith?

A. The Lord Phil. 1. 6, and 29. 2 Cor. 3. 45.
,

Q. The object what?

A. The General, his Word Joh. 5. 46, 47. Exodus 14. 31. Ioh. 2. 22.

The Special, that part which concerns his Son
Christ crucified Ioh. 1. 15. Romans 8. 9, 10, 11.
, our faith's foundation 1 Pet. 2. 6. Act. 4. 11, 12.
.
The sum whereof we have set down in brief
In the twelve Articles of our belief
Which if you please I will repeat and show
The sense of them, but briefly.

Q. Be it so.

10. The Belief.
A My faith's first object, and my faith's sole Author,
Is God in essence, but in person Father Ephesians. 3. 14, 15, 16, 17. Mat. 16. 17.
,
Almighty in his power 1 Chronicles. 29. 11, 12. Psalm. 145. 6.
, the earth's great founder
And heavens builder Genesis 1, to the 11.
, which about does round her 2 Chronicles. 2. 6.

Next Christ in office Rev. 19 16. Deuteronomy. 18. 15. Psalm. 110. 4.
, Jesus by his name Mat. 1. 31.
,
Gods Son in person Psalm. 2. 7. Mat. 3. 17. Romans 1. 2, 3.
, yet with God the same Ioh. 1. 1, 2.
;
Props up my faith Act. 4. 11, 12.
, whom I believe to be
My Lord God man, in one hypostasie Gal 4 4, 5.
,
Born of a Virgin Isa. 7 14.
, whose pure womb his seat
Was made, by the virtue of the paraclete Luke 1. 35.
,
Condemned by Pilate Mat. 27 24, 26.
on the Cross did die
A shameful death Luke 23. 46.
, dead in the grave did lie Mar. 15. 46.
;
So also into Hell he did descend;
The truth whereof even thus me may defend:
In Gethsamane he suffered by's agony Mar. 14. 3., to the 37.
,
So likewise upon the Cross (when he did cry
ELOI, ELOI, LAMASABACHTHANI Mar. 15. 34
?)
The hellish torments due to those that die
In their sins, without regeneration,
And so not capable of Gods compassion Mat. 26. 37, 38, 39. Mat. 27. 46. 1 Pet.
2. 24. 2 Cor. 5. 21.
.
Then after, on the third day he did rise Luke 24. 6, 7. John 2, 19.
,
Triumphant Victor ore his enemies Psalm. 2. 9. 1 Cor. 15, 55, 56, 57.
,
Ascend to heaven Luke 24. 51. Ioh. 3. 13, 14.
where inthronized Rev. 20. 11.
,
He sits Mar. 16. 19.
till he shall judge the quick and dead 2 Cor. 5. 10. Rev. 20. 12, 13.
.
The third main pillar of my faith is he,
Who though proceeding (to make up the three
Persons) both from the Father and the Son,
Yet is not made, because with them he is one Gal. 4. 6. 2 Ioh. 5. 7, 8.
;
Who does restore in us, our goodness lost
By sin 1 Cor. 6. 11.
, whence he is called the Holy Ghost 2 John 5. 7.
.
An universal Church of Saints above Heb. 12. 22, 23.
,
And here united by the bond of love;
I do believe to be 1 Cor. 12. 12, to the end, 2 Phil. 1, to the 6. 2 Col. 19.
, in that I live 1 John 1. 3.
,
Whose sins through Christ his Son God does forgive Isa. 53. 4, to the end.
Dan. 9. 24. Mat. 1. 21. 1 Cor. 18, 19, 21.
:
And will me raise, though dead amongst other men 1 Cor. 15. 12, to the end.
Job 19. 25, 26, 27.
,
And bring me j to eternal life 1 Pet. 1. 3, 4, 5. Heb. 9. 15. Phil. 3. 21.
AMEN.

[ As the Apostles Creed is the sum of the whole Gospel, or as an abstract of
the New Testament: so these eight lines following are the sum of that Creed,
and therefore needs no further proof.]

This is the Creed, whose sum, and sense is this:
I do confide, and put my hope of bliss,
In one Christ crucified, who given me by
The Fathers mercy, does spiritually
Impart himself unto his Church, and me
By God the Holy Ghost to make me be,
Partaker of his deaths most precious merit,
And that I may eternal life inherit.

11. How we are justified by faith in Christ.
Q. Then you make Christ the scope and ground of faith.

A. I do Romans 3. 24, 25.
, and hence it is the Apostle says
Faith justifies Romans 5. 1. Genesis 15. 6. Romans 4. 24. and 3. 28.
.

Q. How?

A. Not as it is a grace compare Romans 4. 5. with Romans 10. 10.
,
But as it does our Savior Christ embrace Gal. 2. 16.
,
Who is our righteousness Phil. 3. 9. John 1. 12.
.

Q. What is it then
To justify us sinners?

A. It is when
For Christ his sake (who both in life and death
Fulfilled the Law for us Romans 5. 17, 18, 19.
) God pardons
Freely our sins Romans 3. 24, 25. Ephesians. 1. 7. Acts 10. 43.
, condemns us not to die Romans 5. 9, 10. John 3. 16.
,
Imputes unto us to eternity
The righteousness of Christ 1 Cor. 1. 30. 2 Cor. 5. 19, 21.
, wherewith arrayed
By faith Rev. 16 15.
(as if we had our selves obeyed
The whole Law perfectly) we in Gods sight,
Holy and pure appear, as is the light Rom 5. 18, 19. This place gives the
reason of the whole answer.
.

Q. Since faith so needful is, I Would have you tell,
By what signs may we know that Christ does dwell
In us by faith?

A. By these, regeneration 2 Cor. 5. 17. 1 John 3. 24. Romans 6. 4. Acts 20. 21.
,
And by the Spirits secret revelation 1 Cor. 6. 11 and 1 Cor. 2. 10. John 14.
16, 17. 1 John 5. 6.
:
For it does with our spirits witness bear,
That we are Gods sons, so that servile fear
Removed as children we dare faithfully,
To God Almighty, Abba, Father, cry Romans 8. 14, 15, 16.
.

12. Concerning Regeneration.
Q What is Regeneration?

A. A renewing
Of mind, will, the whole man, or an endowing
Of them with holy qualities Tit. 3. 5. Ezekiel 36. 25, 26, 27. 2 Cor. 5. 17.
, for in
Whom Christ's Spirit, and faith are, there no sin
Can reign 1 John 3. 9. and 5. 18.
.

Q. What are the parts thereof express?

A. Sin-killing, and a life of righteousness Romans 6. 1, to 5. Col. 3. 9, 10.
.

Q. What Is that?

A. It Is by degrees for to destroy,
(Through Christ his death) sin that does most annoy
The soul, that from thenceforth it is no more,
So potent to deprave, as 'twas before Romans 6. 6. and 12. 14. and 21. 23.
.

Q. What are the means on our part, by which we
May sin subdue?

A. Especially these three:
The sight of sin Psalm. 5 1. 3, 4, 5. 1 John 1. 8, 9.
through self-examination Psalm 4. 4. Gal. 6. 4.
,
Next Godly-sorrow Psalm. 51. 17. 2 Cor. 7. 9, 10, 11.
, with sins detestation Romans 6. 21 and 12. 9.
.

Q. What is that other part, the which you call
A life of righteousness?

A. It is when all
Our faculties throughout, being reformed
By God the Holy Ghost, there are performed Ephesians. 4. 23, 24. Romans 6. 19.

Such actions by them, as which God requires Gal. 5. 22, 23, 25.
;
The Mind knows the true God Col. 1. 10. 1 John 2. 3, 5.
, the Will desires
Him Psalm. 63. 1, 5, 8.
, the Affections do the same pursue Col. 3. 2.
,
And every part acts its office due Romans 6. 1^.
.

Q. Follows it then, what you do seem to say
That in whom Christ abides, only they
Live holy?

A. Yes, even as surely as they live,
Who have a soul, which to them life does give John 15. 5. 2 Cor. 5. 17.
:
And therefore though faith justifies alone Romans 3. 28.
;
The faith that works not, justifies none James 2. 14, 15, 16, 17, 26.
.
For as faith us (as the Apostle says)
Does justify Romans 5. 1.
: so works makes just our faith Iam. 2. 18, 21, to 24.
.

Q. What works?

A. Such works as both the causes whence
They come, the love of God Gal. 5. 6. 1 Ioh. 2. 5. and 5. 2, 3.
, and conscience
Of Duty 2 Cor. 1. 12. Act. 24. 16.
, faith in Christ 1 Pet. 1. 5, to 8.
, and so the end,
Gods glorifying, unto which they tend 1 Cor. 10. 31. Romans 11. 36. Rev. 4. 11.
,
Make pleasing unto God Romans 12. 12. 1 These. 4. 1. Ephesians. 5. 8, 9, 10.
, and do agree
(In some sort) with Gods law Romans 7. 22.
, although they be
Not absolutely perfect Luke 17. 10.
.

Q. What amongst all
Those good works, do you think most principal?

13. Concerning Prayer.
A. Prayer for this is the most evident
Sign of our faith, that we are confident
On Gods love to us, since we dare desire
Of him those good things which our wants require Mat. 22, to the 29.
:
Yea, by the help of this, we get the strength,
Whereby to do all other works at length John 16. 23. Mat. 7. 7, to the 12.
.

Q. But what is Prayer?

A. An affection
Of heart devout Psalm. 62. 8.
, whereby we call upon
God to avert ill from us Psalm. 50. 15.
, and to grant
Unto us such good things as we do want Jam. 1. 5.
:
Which we believe through Christ he will afford
Us John 16. 23.
, asking them according to his word Jam. 1. 6. 1 John 5. 14, Matthew. 7. 21.
.

Q. But dares sinful man by invocation
Soli it God?

A. Yes through the mediation
Of JESUS CHRIST John 14. 13, 14.
, our only Advocate 1 John 2. 12. 1 Timothy 2. 5.
,
In whom our prayers please and impetrate John 14. 13, 14.
.

Q. Why say you only; Do not Saints likewise,
This work of interceding exercise?

A. They do not Psalm 115. 17.
, for they know not what we have
Need of 1 Cor. 2. 11.
; besides since Christ alone does save Acts 4. 12. 1 These. 5. 9.
,
And says that whatsoever (in his name)
We ask the Father, he will give the same John 16. 23.
;
Why should we, nay how dare we in the stead John 14. 6.

Of Christ think Saints shoud intercede!

Q. What are the things which we must pray unto
God for with hope of being heard?

A. What do
Concern God's glory first Mat. 6. 9, 10. being the 3 first Petitions of the
Lords Prayer.
, next our souls good Psalm. 51. 1, to the 13.
,
Then needful things for life, as clothes and food Prove. 30. 8.
,
And therefore that we should not pray amiss,
For things unlawful, what our nature is
Apt to seek after James chapter 1. ver. 6, 7. and 3. chap. ver. 3.
, Christ himself did teach
What good things are, and in what order each
Is to be prayed for, in that Form which he
Prescribed to his Disciples, and which we
Call the Lords Prayer Mat. 6. 9, to the 13. Luke 11. 2, 3, 4.
.

Q. Now this therefore say
And give its sense?

A. Then Christ does bid us pray

14. The Lords Prayer briefly expounded.
Our Fatther, full of mercy Psalm 123. 2, 3. Ephesians. 2. 4. Exodus 20. 6. and 34.
6, 7.
and of love John 3. 16. 1 John 3. 1. and 4 9. Romans 5. 5, 8.
;
Which art: though every where Psalm. 139. 6, to the 13.
, in Heaven above,
Chiefly in glory shining 1 Kings 8. 29, 43. Psalm. 123. 1. Isa. 66. 1.
, Hallowed be,
By pious works 1 Cor. 10. 31. Mat. 5. 16.
, speeches Psalm. 19. 14. and 47. 6, 7.
, and thoughts of thee Psalm. 103. 1, 2.

Thy name Psalm. 83. 18.
: thy sacred Attributes Psalm. 89. 11, to 14.
and Word 2 These. 3. 1. Psalm. 147. 19, 20.
:
Thy Kingdom come Isa. 9. 7.
: as a most mighty LORD,
Show forth thy power 1 Cor. 4. 20. Rev. 4. 10, 11.
, in confounding those, Mat. 6. 9. Isa. 64. 8, 9. Luke 11. 13. Romans 8. 15.

That do maliciously thy Church oppose Psalm. 68. 1, and 18.
:
And Rule thou in it, by thy Spirits grace Ephesians 3. 14 to the end. Gal 6. 16.
,
And make it to behold thy glorious face Psalm 27. 8, 9. Number. 6. 24, 25. 1 Cor.
13. 12.
:
Thy will: thy Law Psalm 119. 1.
. be done Acts 21. 14.
; observed by
Us men in earth Psalm. 119, 32, 33, 34.
and that so readily
As it is by thy blessed Spirits that reign
With thee in heaven Psalm 103 20, 21. Heb. 1. 6, 7.
, so free from sin and pain Mat. 22. 30. Luke 20. 36.

Give Jam 1. 5.
; for we challenge nothing as an hire Genesis 32. 10.
,
Us, that do for the common good desire 1 Timothy 2. 1. Jam. 5. 16.

This day; this time, (for we no longer live
Than thou unto us of thy grace do give Deuteronomy. 8. 7, to the 18.
)
Our, wrought for by us Genesis 3. 19. 1 These. 3. 10, 11, 12.

Our souls food, Christ John 6. 48, to the 58.
, and every benefit
Needful, to maintain life, or strengthen it Genesis 18. 4, to the 9. Mat. 4. 4.
.
And forgive us our trespasses Mat. 18. 24. Romans 3. 9, to the 24. Psalm. 130. 3,
4.
, be pleased
For Christ his merit sake to be appeased,
Toward us, and do thou not us condemn Romans 3. 24, 25, 26 John 5. 24. Romans 8.
1.

(Though we deserve death Romans 5. 12.
) As we forgive men
That trespass against us Mat. 6. 14, 15.
, as we do those
Love and embrace as friends, that are our foes Mat. 5. 44, 45.
.
And lead us not, permit us not to fall Luke 22. 31, 32.
,
Whose nature's frail Romans 7. 33, 34.
, whose strength is none at all 2 Chro. 20. 12. 2 Cor. 3. 5. Acts 15. 10.
.
Into temptation 1 Cor. 1. 13. Jam. 1. 13, 14.
: or to be misled
Into impiety or vanquished
By Satan, But deliver us from evil 2 Cor. 13. 7. John 17. 15.
:
Preserve us from the malice of the Devil 2 Cor. 12. 7, 8. Romans 16. 20.
.
And from the danger of the flesh Romans 7. 5, 18. and 8. 5, 6, 7, 8.
, and world 1 John 5. 4, 5.
,
Lest after into Hell we should be hurled,
For thine is (only thine) the kingdom, none
Does reign in earth, but under thee alone,
Chief King of kings 1 Chro. 29. 11. Deuteronomy. 10. 17. Rev. 19. 16.
. The power what it will
Effecting 2 Chro. 20. 6. Isa. 50. 2, 3. 1 Chro. 29. 12.
, and the glory Rev. 4. 11. Luke 2. 14.
, that does fill 1 Chro. 21. 1, 2, 3, 4. 2 Chr. 20. 12.
Luke 12. 5. Mat. 23. 33.

The world with its greatness Number. 14. 21. Exodus 40. 34. 1 Kings 8. 11.
; and delight
The Saints beyond expression, that its sight
Fully enjoy Psalm. 16. 11.
, for ever, both before,
All time and ever Psalm. 48. 14. and 145. 21.
, after it is no more Psalm. 90. 2.
:
Amen Rev. 22. 20, 21. Ephesians. 3. 21.
. Let it be done, for we believe,
The things that we have prayed for, thou can give Jam 1. 5. 1 Cor. 4. 7.
.

Q. But is it needful that we always say,
Our Saviors very word when we do pray?

A. No it is enough sometimes they do accord
In matter with this Prayer of the Lord compare Mat. 6. 9. with Luke 11. 2.
,
But yet with understanding them to use,
Better it were for us, than to abuse
Our Saviors warrant for it, so to do;
By quite neglecting or contemning to
Use those his very words, at any time;
For so to do, will surely prove a crime,
Because our Savior bids us when we pray,
Our Father which art in heaven -- Luke 11. 2.
to say.

Q. Now you have show d what things, show how we must
Pray for them?

A. Surely it is very just,
If we expect a gracious audience
From God Psalm. 4. 1. and 5. 1, 2, 3.
, that we should pray in faith Jam. 1. 5, 6, 7. Mar. 11. 24.
, a sense
Of our own wants Luke 15. 17, 18, 19.
, lowly humility Luke 18. 13, 14.
,
Repentance Psalm. 51, the whole Psalm.
, constancy 1 These. 1 17. Ephesians. 6. 18.
, sincerity Psalm 17. 1. and 145. 18, 19. 1 Timothy 2. 8.
,
Zeal Jam. 5. 16.
, understanding 1 Cor. 14. 15.
, wrongs forgetting Mar. 11. 24, 25.
, love Mat. 5. 44. 1 Timothy 1. 2.
,
With a mind wholly fixed on things above h.

15. Concerning Gods Word and Sacraments.
Q Besides our faith, Gods Word and Sacraments
You said were also used as instrument's See page 10.

In ^oyning (...) to Christ?

A. The means whereby
God faith begets, and so does apply
Christ to our souls, are these indeed Acts 2. 41, 42, 46.
.

Q What do
You mean hereby the Word of God?

A. The two
Most sacred Testaments, whose principal
Parts we the Law and Gospel use to call Gal. 4. 22, to the 28.
.

Q. To what end serves the preaching of the Law?

A. By showing us our misery Romans 3. 19, 20. and 7. 8.
to draw
Us to desire the saving remedy Gal. 3. 24.
,
Such as may ease and cure that misery Gal. 4. 4, 5. Romans 10. 4. Gal. 3. 13, 14.
.

Q. How does Gods Word by the Gospels preaching
Infuse into us faith?

A. By therein teaching Romans 10. 14, 15, 17.
,
That for us who deserve death Ephesians. 2. 3, 12.
, Christ has died Gal. 3. 13. Romans 5. 6, 8.
,
And thereby has Gods anger pacified Ephesians. 2. 13, to the end. 2. Cor. 5. 18,
19.
:
And that in him who does believe Heb. 11. 6. Acts 16. 36.
may have
Whatso'ver things is needful them to save Romans 5 9, 10. 1 Cor. 30.
.

16. Concerning the Sacraments in general.
Q. What is a Sacrament, whereby you say,
God does unto our souls his Christ convey?

A. A holy sign ordained by the Lord Ex. 12. chapter. Mat. 28. 19. and 26. 26,
27, 28.
,
Joined to the gracious promise of his Word Romans 15. 8. Mar. 16. 16

To signify our Savior Christ 1 Cor. 11. 23, to the 27.
, withal
His gifts Acts 2. 38, 39. 1 Cor. 10. 16.
, and to assure us that we shall
Enjoy them Romans 4. 11.
, if (as we thereby are bound)
We do by faith Romans 4. 24
, and an obedi'nce sound
Continue his Romans 6. 4. and 4. 12. 1 Samuel 15. 22.
.

Q. How many Sacraments
Are there?

A. l'th former of the Testaments
Many As not only those of Circumcision and the Paschall Lamb, which were in
stead of Baptism and the Lords Supper; but also some before, and some after,
some of the Covenant of Works, as those of the Tree of Life, and the Tree of
Knowledge of Good and Evil, Genesis 2. 9. and others after of the Covenant of
Grace which were Sacraments extraordinary, as that of Manna and the Water
flowing out of the Rock, 1 Cor. 10. 3, 4. and of the pouring out the Blood of
the Sacrifices, Hebr. 9. 17, 18. and of the Land of Canaan, the Tabernacle, the
Temple, the Arc of the Covenant, and many more that did relate to Christ.
, but in the Gospel only two:
Baptism Mat. 28. 19.
, and that which commonly we do
Call the Lords Supper Mat. 26. 26, 27, 28.
: one of our isition
Into Christ's body Gal. 3. 27.
, or our first admission
Into his Church 1 Cor. 12. 13.
: the other of our growth
In Jesus Christ John 6. 44, 45, 46.
, and education both 1 Cor. 1. 16.
.

Q. What are the chiefest things I Would have you show,
Touching each Sacrament we ought to know?

A. I will, these four which represent;
The outward signs, what grace by them is meant,
What is the union of them both, and what
The manner, we do both communicate.

Q. What are the signs?

A. The elements we see
And rites Mat. 3. 11. Genesis 17. 11. 1 Pet. 3. 20, 21.
which elements we say to be
Changed, not in nature or in quality,
But in their use, 'cause now they signify
Celestial things 1 Cor. 10. 1, 2, 3.
, not through man's recitation
Of any words, but Christ's own ordination 1 Cor. 11. 23, 24, 25.


Q. What are the signified things?

A. The main
Is Christ 1 Cor. 11. 26. and 1. 1. 10, 16, 17.
, next him what blessings we obtain
In him 1 Cor. 1. 30.
.

Q What kind of union do you call
This of the signs, and things Celestial?

A. An union relative, which does consist
In a respect betwixt the signs and Christ Luke 22. 19, 20.
,
Whereby with them presented to the sense
He Is offered us to be by confidence
Applied Romans 4. 11, and 24.
.

Q On what depends this relation?

A. Gods promise Mar. 16. 16.
, and his Spirits operation 1 Cor. 12. 13.
.

Q. How are the Sacraments thing signified
As signs received?

A. In whom faith does abide,
They are partakers of the inward grace,
And Christ himself (although in heavenly place)
As truly (through the virtue of Gods Sprite)
As of the signs objected to the sight Col. 2. 11, 12, 13. 1 Cor. 5. 7.
:
But faithless men, though they receive the sign,
Do not the signified things divine compare Act. 8. 13. with 21. 1 Cor. 11 21.
.

17. Concerning Baptism:
Q. What Is Baptism?

A. It Is of our admittance in
To Christ his Church 1 Cor. 12. 13.
; a Sacrament wherein
By Waters washing Mat. 3. 11.
, in the Trinities,
Fathers, Sons, Spirits, name Mat. 28. 19.
, God signifies,
Seals, and applies to us, our cleansing by
The blood of Christ Rev. 1. 5.
, from all iniquity 1 Ioh. 1. 7.
.

Q What are the signs in Baptisme's Sacrament?

A. Water is the external element Mat. 3. 11.
:
Dipping in water first, or sprinkling, then
From under it a coming forth again;
Are the substantial rites This is implied Romans 6. 4.
.

Q. What Is understood
By these?

A. The sprinkling of our Saviors blood,
To wash us from our sinful filthiness Rev. 7. 14. Ephesians. 5. 26. Ezech. 36. 25.
Heb. 10. 22.
,
And imputation of his righteousness Ephesians. 5. 27. Gal. 3. 27.
;
A killing of the old man, through the force
Of Christ his death and burial, of his course Romans 6. 3, 4, 6. Col. 2. 12.
,
A quickening of our spirits through the strength
Of Christ, his resurrection Romans 6. 5.
, and at length
A raising of our bodies 1 Cor. 15. 29.
, last of all,
A sacred obligation mutual,
Of God, and us baptized, whereby he
Does bind himself to be our God Act. 2. 38, 39.
, and we
To serve him Mat 3. 8, 11. Romans 6. 13. and 7. 4.
, and to fight against his foes,
Satan James 4. 7.
, the flesh Gal. 5. 16, 17.
and world, that him oppose James 4. 4. 1 John 2. 15.
.

Q. In Baptism what does water figure most
Chiefly?

A. Christ's blessed blood and holy Ghost 1 John 5. 6. John 3. 5. Ephesians. 5. 26.
.

Q. Why does the water and these things agree,
In any manner of analogy?

A. Yes; for as water helps to generate Psalm. 104. 14.

That it may fructify does irrigate
The earth Psalm. 104. 10, 13.
, does wash away the filthiness
Of bodies 1 Samuel 25. 42. John 13. 5.
, and does quench our thirstiness Exodus 17. 3.
.
In manner like, through the most wholesome merit
Of Christ his blood Heb. 9. 12, 13, 14.
, and working of his Spirit 1 John 5. 6.
,
We are regenerated John 7. 5.
, washed white
From sin Ephesians. 5. 26. Psalm. 51. 7
, (who else are filthy in his sight Psalm. 51. 2, 3.
)
And by the sweetest showers of graces drenched Psalm. 72. 6. Hos. 9. 3.

Bring forth much fruit John 15. 2, 4, 5.
and have our souls thirst Psalm. 63. 1. Isa. 55. 1.
quenched John 4. 14.
.

Q. How is this sacrament received?

A All
Who are baptized in manner natural
Receive the signs Act. 2. 41. and 8. 13.
; but what they signify Gal. 3. 27. Ephesians. 5. 26.
,
As by the Holy Ghost spiritually
Given 1 Cor. 12. 13. Tit. 3. 5.
) they only who have faith indeed Mar. 16. 16. As those that are of age.
,
Or if not faith it self, its heavenly seed As in Infants, for to them belongs
the Kingdom of God, Mat. 19. 14. and they are within the Covenant of Grace,
Act. 2. 39. and 3. 25. and some are sanctified in the womb, as Jeremy and S.
John Baptist, and therefore have the seeds of faith.
.

18. Concerning the Lords Supper.
Q. What Is the Lord's Supper?

A. It Is a Sacrament
Of Confirmation 1 Cor. 10. 16, 17.
, that does represent 1 Cor. 11. 26.
,
Commemorate Luke 22. 19.
, obsignate and apply
Unto the faithful instrumentally 1 Cor. 10. 16, 17.
,
(By given and received bread and wine,
(According unto ordinance divine 1 Cor. 11. 23, 24, 25.
)
Christ's body that was slain, blood that was shed,
To save us from damnation merited Mat. 26. ^6, 27, 28. Romans 5. 8, 9. 1 These.
1. 10.
;
By virtue of which body and which blood,
(As of our souls only sufficient food)
Nourisht we are John 6. 54, 55, 56.
, and grow in faith and love Jude ver. 20, 21. Gal 5. 6.
,
Till to be perfect men in Christ we prove Col. 1. 28, 29. Ephesians. 4. 13.
.

Q. What are the signs in the Lords Supper?

A. Bread
And Wine, the elements administered 1 Cor. 10. 16.
,
The rites are when the Minister has prayed,
And Christ his words of institution said.
And breaks the bread, and does deliver both
The bread and wine to every one that does
Come to the Supper, who must take both; eat
The bread and drink the wine This whole answer is made good by Christ's own
institution of this Sacrament, Mat. 26. 26, 27, 28. Mar. 14. 22, 23, 24. Luke
22. 19, 20.
.

Q. What are the great
Secrets imported by these signs?

A. The thing
Whereof these are the signs exhibiting,
Is Jesus Christ his body and his blood 1 Cor. 10. 16.
,
With every grace of his and saving good 1 Cor. 1. 30.
,

Q. What mean the Rites?

A. The breaking of the bread
Does show how Christ was broken, tortured
Upon the Cross, and in his agony compare Mat. 26. 26. with Mat. 27. 38, 46.
and with John 19. 34.
:
The giving of the signs, how graciously
The Father has bestowed on us his Son,
With all the merits of his passion compare Luke 22. 22, 23. with 1 Cor. 10.
16. and with 1 Cor. 1. 30.
:
Our taking, eating, drinking, show how we
By faith lay hold on Jesus Christ, and he
Becomes ours so truly and indeed,
As does the very meat whereon we feed compare Mat. 26. 26, 27. with 1 Cor. 12.
27. and with 1 Cor. 10. 16.
.

Q But why was bread ordained as a sign
Of Christ his body, of his blood, why wine?

A. By reason of the likeness 'twixt his blood
And wine, his body and that kind of food 1 Cor. 10. 16, 17.
.
Bread is the stay of our life natural Mat. 6. 11.
,
And so is Christ of our spiritual John 6. 33, 35, 48, 51.
;
Bread is our daily food Luke 11. 3.
, and daily need
Our souls on Christ their heavenly bread to feed John 6. 53, to 58.
;
As many grains one loaf of bread do make,
And of that one loaf many may partake:
So we, though many, in one bread subsist,
And of that bread partake, even Jesus Christ 1 Cor. 10. 16, 17.
.
And as from pressed grapes do issue wine Deuteronomy. 32. 14.
,
Which comfort the heart Judge. 9. 13. Psalm. 104. 15.
, so from the vine,
Christ John 15. 1, 5.
, by the weight of Gods wrath sorely pressed Mat. 26. 38, 39. Mat. 27. 46.
,
There issued his blood, the liquor blessed John 19. 30, 34.
,
That does as wine, warm, comfort, animate,
Strengthen, revive, delight, exhilerate John 6. 54, 56. Cant. 5. 1.
.

Q. What is the manner that we do receive
The Supper of the Lord?

A. What we perceive
Thereof by sense, the same we orally or, with the mouth.

Receive 1 Cor. 11. 26. Mat. 26. 26, 27.
, but what they show spiritually,
(For Christ his presence is not corporal
In the Lords Supper, but symbolicall 1 Cor. 10. 16.
)
That Is only by our hearts, not hands, embraced,
And is the object of our faith, not taste Mat. 26. 26, 27. For in those words
of institution, our Savior infolds both the Natural and Spiritual eating and
drinking, wherein consists the true nature of a Sacrament: so that the bread
and wine are the body and blood of Christ sacramentally, or by a sacramental
metonymie; and the bread and wine are received by the mouth of the body: and
the body and blood of Christ by the mouth of the soul, viz: by a true and
lively faith.
.

Q. Who then receives this Supper worthily?

A. They who repent 1 Cor. 11. 31.
, have faith 2 Cor. 13. 5.
and charity Act. 2. 42, and 4. 32, 34. 1 Cor. 11. 28, 29.
.

Q. What is the end wherefore we celebrate
This Sacrament?

A. It Is to commemorate
Christ, and to show his death by thinking on
Intentively, his bitter passion 1 Cor. 11. 26.
;
That so by those good things we therein see 1 Cor. 10. 16.

Our souls for ever comforted may be Cant. 5. 1. 2 Cor. 1. 3, 4, 5.
.

Q. Now you have showed the means, whereby Christ is
Offered and apprehended with all his
Merits and benefits, it does remain,
You show to whom those graces do pertain.

19. A discourse concerning the Church.
A. They do belong unto the Church Acts 2. 39, 41.
, and none
Have interest in them, but she alone Romans 10. 14, 16. Ephesians. 2. 13. John 8. 24.
.

Q. What is the Church?

A. An holy company
Of men elected Col. 3. 12. Ephesians. 1. 4, 5. Romans 8. 29.
, called powerfully 1 Cor. 1. 2. Romans 1. 7. 1 Timothy 1. 9. Romans 8. 30.
,
From out the world John 17. 6, 9, 16.
, by preaching of the Word Romans 10. 17. Ephesians. 1. 12, 13.
,
To be the sole peculiar of the Lord 1 Pet. 2. 9, 10. Tit. 2. 14.
:
Built upon Christ, Mat. 21. 42. 1 Cor. 3. 9.
as on a sure foundation 1 Cor. 3 10, 11.
,
That God in it may have his habitation John 17. 23. Ephesians. 2. 21, 22.
,
And there be served in faith Heb. 11. 6.
, b^ prayer expressed James 1. 6.
,
And holiness both inward Ephesians. 1. 4. Col. 1. 22. Ephesians. 4. 23, 24.
and professed Ephesians. 4, 1, 2, 3. 2 Cor. 7. 1.
.

Q. How manifold is this Church?

A. One 1 Cor. 12. 13. where Christ in regard of the spiritual union and
conjunction is taken for the Church.
: though we
That are the members, very many be 1 Cor. 12. 15. and 10. 17.
*
For as there is one God Ephesians. 4. 6.
, faith ver. 5.
, hope of bliss ver. 4.
,
Head of the Church Ephesians. 1. 22. and 4. 13, 5. Col. 1. 18.
; so consequently, is
The Church one Ephesians. 4. 4. and 2. 14, 16.
, that is the body mystical 1 Cor. 10. 17.
,
Of that head, Jesus Christ the Lord of all Ephesians. 4. 5. Act. 10. 36. Ephesians. 1.
22.
.

Q. If that the Church be one, in what sense do
We say, she may be seen, and may not too?

20. Concerning the Church visible and invisible.
A. The whole Church Catholic Isa. 2. 2, 3. Act. 10. 34, 35.
, Christ's body Ephesians. 1. 23. Col. 1. 18.
, house 1 Timothy 3. 15.
,
The Templ^ of the Lord Ephesians. 1. 21.
, his City Heb. 12. 22. Revel. 21. 10. Ephesians. 2. 19.
, Spouse Cant. 4. 9, to 12.
,
Cannot be seen, because it does contain
The number of all them that do pertain
To Christ, as well the blessed saints on high,
Who cannot be beheld with mortal eye Heb. 12. 22.
;
As faithful living John 10. 16. and 11. 52.
: though particular
Churches or Congregations, which are
But some part of that Church, apparent be,
Because we do the outward fashion see,
Of their religion 1 Cor. 1. 2. and 2 Cor. 1. 1. Gal. 2. Rom 16. 5. Col. 4. 15.
.

Q. The whole Church, why
Do you call Catholic?

A. To signify
She is not ty'de to certain times, or men,
Nor places, (as before Christ's coming, when
God was in Jury only worshipped Psalm. 76. 1, 2. Isa. 2. 3.
)
But is throughout the whole world scattered Acts 10. 33, 34, 35. 1 These. 1. 8.
:
And is still to endure Luke 1. 33.
, and has among
All kinds of men, some that to her belong Isa. 60, the whole chap.
.

Q. Who are these?

A. Not who only do profess
Faith, and have but the Form of Godliness 2 Timothy 3. 8.
:
For albeit such kind of men have place
In the Church visible Act* 8. 13.
, yet to the grace
Of being members I mean true members of the Church.
of the same, attain
They do not 1 John 2. 19. John 15. 6. 2 Timothy 4. 10. Act. 8. 21. Mat. 22. 14.
; but those in whom grace does reign Tit. 2. 11, 12. 1 Pet. 1. 5.
:
For Christ his Church is holy Ephesians. 1. 4, 5.
, 'cause his blood
Has cleansed her from sin Ephesians. 1. 7.
, to do what is good as ver. 3, 4.
.

21. Who is head of the Church.
Q. Who of the Churches body is the head?

A. Christ Jesus Col. 1. 18. Ephesians. 1. 12.
.

Q Who besides in Christ his stead?

A. None other, for it is monstrously unfit
One body should to many heads be knit Ephesians. 5. 23, 30. this Text proves it as
unfit as for a woman to have many husbands.
:
And what need there any head less principal,
To guide and rule the Church, since there dwells all
Fullness in Christ Colos. 2. 3, 9. Isa 9. 6, 7.
: and as the head does sense
Unto the body, so Christ influence
Spiritual, unto the Church conveyes Col. 2. 10, 11, 12.
,
And every where is with her, and always Matthew. chap. 28. ver. 20. John 14.
16, 18.
.

Q. But may there not be some to oversee
Churches particular? Is It so that he,
Because he does the whole Church regulate;
Excludes governors subordinate
Of Churches visible?

A. No each such, must
Have one, or many, who not as they lust 1 Pet. 5. 3.

But as Gods Word allows them, must guide,
Govern, defend it safely, and provide
That God be purely served, that they be curbed,
By whom the Churches peace may be disturbed; And this has respect as well to
the Civil Power as to Ecclesiastical Authority, and to both in their several
stations, and it belongs to the Civil Power; first for the defense of the
Church, as Judges 2. 16. and secondly, because without that, true Religion
cannot long stand, as Judge. 17. 6. 1 Chro. 14. 3. 1 Kings 10. 9. and therefore
when God at any time does favorably look upon a nation, he does still raise up
such guiders, governors and defenders of them, and providers for his pure
service, and such as may curb the enemies of his Church; such were Moses,
Josua, David, Solomon, Jehoshaphat, Josias, Hezekias, Constantine the great,
with many other Christian Princes.

That all things be in decent order done 1 Cor. 14. 40. 1 Cor. 11. 34. Ephesians. 4.
11, 1^.
,
And who offends may have correction 1 Timothy 1. 20. Now to see that all things
be done in the Church, in such decent order, and that those may be punished,
that by obstinate resistance, or scandalous living, shall transgress against
it; this solely belongs to Ecclesiastical Authority, as by these ensuing
places may be proved. 1 Pet. 5 2, 3. 1 Timothy 5. 7. 17, 19, 20 Act. 20. 17. Heb.
13. 7. 17. Mat. 16. 19. John 20. 23. 1 Cor. 5. 2 These. 3. 6. and 12, 14, 15.
Mat. 18. 15, 16, 17, 18. Tit. 3. 10.
.

22. The description of a true Church.
Q But tell me, by what marks infallible,
We may discern a true Church visible
From a corrupt?

A. In that Church where Gods Word
Is purely taught John 8. 31, 32. and 10. 27. Act. 2. 42. 2 Ep. John. 9.
, the Supper of the Lord,
And Baptism, minister'd in manner due,
After Christ's Ordinances, that Church is true Math. 28. 19. Act. 2. 38. Luke
22. 19, 20. Act. 2. 42.
.

Q. Is every man when he those marks has found
In any Congregation, there bound
To join himself unto it, and profess
Himself a Member of it?

A. Surely yes,
To some such Church or other, every man
Must join himself, so far forth as he can Act. 2. 47. Psalm. 133. the whole.
:
For every such Church is a School, where God
The Master is Isa. 54. 13. Mat. 23. 8.
, afflictions his rod Psalm. 119. 71.
;
The Testaments the Books which there are read,
The Law, and Gospel, there delivered Gal. 4. 24.
,
With Preachers exposition explained Romans 10. 14, 15.
,
Lessons that must be learned, and retained
In mind and heart Psalm. 119. 1, 2, 7, 10, 11.
: now in the Schools must he,
As a young Scholar educated be Psalm. 119. 9. Deuteronomy. 11. 18, 19.
,
That does aspire unto a place on high,
In the most glorious University Ephesians. 2. 6. Mat. 25. 34.
.

23. Concerning the joys of Heaven.
Q What University?

A. Even that same where The Saints are Fellows, who were Scholars here: The
Angels Fellows, in the joint fruition Of joys, arising from Gods blissful
Vision 1 John 1. 3, 4. Heb. 12. 22, 23, 24.


Q. What joys?

A. eye has seen, Nor heard by mortal ears have ever been;
Neither, what great joys they are, it enter can
Into the Sinful heart of Carnal man 1 Cor. 2. 9.
.

Q. What is this Vision whence you say arise
These joys?

A. It is to know God in such wise
As we our selves are known; to have that grace
As to behold him clearly face to face 1 Cor. 9. 10, 12.
.

Q. And why call you it blissful?

A. Cause hereon
Depend there does our glorification Psalm. 16. 11. Phil. 3. 21. Heb. 12. 22, 23.
.
For seeing him Ps. 73. 25. and 142. 5. and 33. 12.
, him we shall have, and have
In him, all good things, that our Souls can crave 1 Cor. 15. 28. Romans 8. 32.
;
And we shall be transformed into his
Image, so fa^re forth, as our nature is
Made capable thereof 2 Cor. 3. 18. 1 John 3. 2.
, and shine as light,
Our Souls and Bodies shall in glory bright Compare 1 John 1. 5. and John 1.
4, 5, 9. with Joh. 6. 56. and 1 John 3. 24.
.

Q. How long?

A. For ever 1 These. 4. 17. Psalm. 90. 2.
: for our bliss (as he
That is its object x) shall eternal be 1 Pet. 5. 10. Luke 18. 30.
.

Q. But to be happy in such sort, you say
Belongs not unto all men?

A. True: for they
Who are not Soldiers in the Church, that here
Is Militant, may not as Victors wear
Crowns, in the Church triumphant 2 Timothy 4. 7, 8. Jam. 1. 12. Revel. 2. 20. 1
Pet. 5. 4.
; not behold
Christ's glory, that are not of Christ's Fold Compare John 10. 16. ver. with 26,
27, 28. ver.
.

24. Concerning the day of Judgment.
Q. How shall it then be with the wicked?

A. All
Shall suffer punishment perpetual Jud. 14, 15. 2 These. 1. 7, 8, 9.
,
According to their works Romans 2. 5, 6. Luke 12. 47, 48.
, for Christ shall come
To judge the world 2 Cor. 5, 10. Act. 10. 42. Act. 17. 31. 2 Timothy 4. 1 John 5.
22.
, and having placed some
On his Right hand Mat. 25. 33, 34.
, I mean the Sons of light John 12. 36.
;
Thus, he will them most graciously invite:
Come blessed of my Father, and inherit
The glorious Kingdom Mat. 25. 34.

FINIS.
WHat good is taught us here, Lord do thou make
Us perfectly to know, for Christ his sake;
And let that knowledge, so inform our mind,
That through it, in our hearts we be inclined,
To do that good sincerely though we may
Offend in many things through weaknesse^ say
O gracious God, the Word, and it will then
Be done, what we pray for, Amen, Amen.
