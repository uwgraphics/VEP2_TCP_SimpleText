ISRAEL's REFORMATION.

Haec ultra quid erit nisi Ludus?

Juvenal LONDON: Printed in the Year, School.

Israel's Reformation.
WHen the Children of Israel did what they would,
Not crampt with dull Notions of Evil or Good,
But lived at their Liberty, curbed by no Law,
No King to control 'em, or keep 'em in Awe;
Then blessed were the People with Plenty and Peace,
Till their wavering Minds took a Surfeit of ease;
For Humor, like blood, in a high State of Health,
Grows disorderly hot, and enflameth it self.
The Hebrews were always a murmuring Rout,
A giddy-brain'd Race ever veering about;
What with eager Desires one day they pursued,
The next they despised, and more heartily loathed;
Like the Frogs in the Fable, a King they would have,
For the sake of a Change, they would Slavery crave.
Many Monarchs of different Tempers they had;
Now blessed with a Good, next oppressed with a bad:
But long were they ruled by a Monarch, did hate
The troublesome Cares and Affairs of the State:
Egyptian Delights his Affections did please,
He dissolved all his Senses in Riot and Ease;
His Will was his Law, and his Pleasure his Guide,
A Slave to his Tust, without Power or Pride:
He by his Example made them go astray,
Though stubborn, yet in Ill, they their Rulers obey,
Then Sodom was guiltless, compared to the Land,
For who was in Fashion, was sure to be damned;
But nothing that is mortal can ever remain,
A Period is put to his Life and his Reign.
Now Israelites Hope, since this Monarch is dead,
That the Vices and Customs of Egypt are fled;
And the next Prince's Virtue so far may extend,
His Example may teach all the Bad to amend;
They Are in a Mistake, though they have changed their Condition,
It Is worse and worse still, to a damned Superstition;
For he cursed Idolatry strove to recall,
Building Altars and Temples to Moloch and Baal:
But Heaven to show how that People he loved,
In Pity looked down, and those Mischefs removed;
And sent 'em a Hero, who eased all their Care,
And made 'em more happy than ever they were;
His Person did venture, of Dangers partake,
Despised any Hazards that were for their Sake;
War's frightful Alarms, he commanded to cease,
And through the Realm scattered Plenty and Peace.
Just so, when bellowing Winds roared our aloud;
And dismal Tempests shook the affrighted Crowd;
When hardy Sailors trembled at the Storm,
Fearless of death, yet feared it in this Form;
The mounting Waves our Blessed Savior laid,
A Calm commanded, and the Winds obeyed.
The Sanbedrim for the great Blessing was sent,
Vote their Thanks to the Lord with a mutual Consent;
And the Land to reform they resolve in a trice,
With Statutes and Laws to give Battle to Vice.
To encounter with Satan their Forefathers thought,
'Twas enough if Gods Doctrine was faithfully taught,
For Moses against him no otherwise fought:
But Senate profound, by Experience did find,
That Scripture Divine had small Force on the Mind,
And that Others no more, than Themselves it did bind:
To tell you the Truth, 'twas no Wonder at all,
That their Faith and Religion were dwindled so small;
For how should a Stranger walk in the right Way,
When the Guide he relies on is wandered astray,
Who considers how loosely the Teachers did ride,
Cannot blame the poor Learners for slipping aside;
The Levite on Sabbath against Drinking would rail,
And on the next day to his Text would turn tail.
A Gleek of their Teachers whose Pockets were stored,
With the Ready so flush, as good Wine to afford,
Would secretly meet to avoid the Worlds Eye,
That censuring Laity might not espy;
In Rome that was private, but first they took Care,
Good store to procure of their Darling Red Ware;
A dosen and half of good Flasks they provide,
With Edibles curious, and Plenty beside,
For Priests have nice Palates or else they are belied:
Too much you will imagine six Bottles a piece,
But Faith Sir, believe me, they will do it with Fase;
Three's enough for a Layman, but a Divine
Will easily dispense with six bottles of Wine;
For he that drinks most will be sure to inherit,
Of all the dull Tribe the best Portion of Spirit:
Time pleasantly passes, they are merry and free,
Good sanctified Men, for the World did not see.
Nay the poor Country Levite, whose 20 Pound yearly,
Could no higher stretch than Infusion of Barley;
In some little Alehouse he never would fail,
To soak divine Carcass in Nappy brown Ale,
Contentedly swallowing his vile Muddy Liquor,
Till changing his Station, he rises to better;
And now the true Reason is found out at last,
Why the Rabbis full Sides grow so gracefully fast;
When his own very Curate's so lean you would swear,
He was fed by the Tithes of the fat Drs. Prayer,
Or like the Cameleon he lived upon air;
Cram him with a Living as large as the rest,
He Will soon make as Jolly a Priest as the best;
Their Paunches and Tithes grow in Consort together,
As one does increase, so increases the other.
Hilkiab, whom Israelite Annals do place
Amongst the Reverend Heads of the sanctified Race.
For Eloquence famed, for his Learning was praised,
But his Wir above all lasting Laurels had raised,
Because it is a Plant very rarely is found
To grow upon barren Levitical Ground;
Yet this famous Rabbin is left on Record,
As suspected to live without fear of the Lord;
Though the Jews for his Wit did him so much adore,
It was whispered about that he both drank and swore;
Nay, 'twas shrewdly suspected too that he did -- more.
Jehazel, another Rabbinical Chief,
Famed for grave Aspect, and Sanctity of Life,
But powerful Interest so strongly was mixed,
That the Priest from his pious Resolves it unfixt,
His Jehu-like furious desire to be Great,
To the Hebrews betrayed his Devotion a Cheat.
Nor must Rabbi Joram escape being named,
Through all their Records for his Avarice famed,
So publicly known to be guilty, the Poor
Set a Mark (that they might not lose time) at his door;
So in Places of Danger, a Beacon's raised high,
To give Notice to Sailors they must not come nigh,
But keep as far off as they can, and pass by.
Their Magistrates too, as their Histories say,
Were found with the Levites to walk the wrong Way;
And those were invested with Power immense,
Could boast of possessing most Riches, not Sense;
Their Judges took Bribes, and perverted the Laws,
He that gave the most Money never failed of the Cause;
For Right to the Wealthy does always belong,
To be poor is demonstrative Proof to be wrong;
Forma Pauperis never recovers the Land,
Bad Latin, how should the wise Judge understand?
Abiezer would fit all the Morning on Bench,
And in Evening was found to be smuggling a Wench;
Though the Power had left him a long time ago,
And Wishing and Kissing are all he can do.
So swift-footed Ringwood, that in the fair Chase,
Was ever the Leader, and never failed the Race;
And Fleet-as the Winds, having run down his Foe,
With a Courage undaunted he seizes him too;
Though worn out with Age, yet he still loves the Park,
And unable to stand, he will lie down and bark.
When the News of hard Laws, and severe Reformation,
Was first noised about through the Israelite Nation,
The Toper so scared, with Affright he turned pale,
And the blustering Courage of Swearer did fail;
Pretty Miss, who with Pleasure takes pains for her Bread,
At the hated Report, was most dismally 'fraid,
Lest the Ill-natured Laws should have ruined her Trade;
But their Fears were all vain, for the very Lawmakers,
In an Instant of time, were converted to Breakers;
For rising from Hall, where they gravely had been,
Seven hours declaiming against Satan and Sin,
They parted, and each took a several way,
Some Gaming, some Drinking, and some to the Play.
Dull Elaham swills till he is almost dead drunk,
Then staggering, reels to some nasty Clapped Punk.
Pert Azel at Gaming sits up the whole Night,
He has nothing to live by, but what he gets by it;
With these many more might be named, but my Muse,
For their Quality's sake, does the Office refuse.
Thus by their Example encouraged in Ill,
The rest of the People remained wicked still;
Their Statutes and Laws had no Power or Force,
For the Hebrews instead of Reforming, grew worse;
And every one followed his own Inclination,
Sin still reigned triumphant and kept in the Fashion,
In spite of the Cry of a strict Reformation;
As soon as the Statutes were made, they were broke,
And the Penalties all flew away in a Smoke.
So when upon the Beach I Have safely stood,
Viewing the Surges of the curling Flood,
I Have seen the lofty Billows roaring, rise
With foaming Tops, and dashed the frighted Skies;
Look but one Minute hence, the threatening Wave is gone,
And to a silent Bubble turned, unheeded glides along.
FINIS.
