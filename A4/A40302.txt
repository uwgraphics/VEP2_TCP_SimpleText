TO THE POPE And all his MAGISTRATES And the PROTESTANTS, Here they and all
Christendom may see the moderation of the Heathen Emperors to the Christians
in the 650 years before there was a Pope, signified by their Letters following
in the behalf of the Christians Liberty, which will rise up in Judgment
against the Popes and their Emperors, and his Magistrates, and most of the
Protestants, as here you may see in the reading of their Declarations, and the
straitness of the Orders of those called Christians now, and the largeness of
the Heathens then, as concerning liberty in the Spirit to worship God, and also
here you may see the Heathen were more moderate to the Christians, then the
Christians, so called, are one to another. Taken out of the Ten Persecutions.

The Letter of Adrian the Emperor to Minutius Fundanus.
I Have received an Epistle written unto me from Great vol. page 37 in the
third persecution, an 140
Serenus Granius our right worthy and welbeloved whose office you do now
execute; Therefore I think it not good to leave this matter without further
advisement and circumspection to pass, least our Subjects be molested, and
malicious Sycophants boldned and supported in their evil; wherefore if the
Subjects of our Provinces do bring forth any accusation before the Judge
against the Christians, and can prove the thing they object against them, let
them do the same and no more, and otherwise for the name only, not to impeach
them, nor to cry out against them; for so, more convenient it is, that if any
man will be an accuser, you to take the accusation quietly and judge upon the
same; Therefore, if any shall accuse the Christians, and complain of them as
Malefactors, doing contrary to the Law, then give you judgment according to the
quality of the crime; but notwithstanding whosoever upon spite and
maliciousness shall commence or cavil against them, see you correct and punish
that man for his inordinate and malicious dealing.

The Epistle of Antonius Pius to the Commons of Asia.
Emperor and Caesar, Aurelius, Antonius, Augustus, Arminius, Pontifix Maximus,
Tribune eleven times, Consul thrice,
unto the Commons of Asia, greeting, page 37. Anno 140 in the 3d. persecution.

I Am very certain that the gods have a care of this, that they which be such
shall be known, and not lie hid, for they do punish them that will not worship
them more than you, which so sore vex and trouble them, confirming thereby the
opinion which they have conceived, and do conceive of you; that is, to be
wicked men, for this is their joy and desire, that when they are accused,
rather they covet to dye for their god then to live, whereby they are
victorers, and do overcome you, giving rather their lives then to be obedient
to you, in doing that which you require of them; and here it shall not be
inconvenient to advertize you of the Earthquakes which have and do happen among
us, that when at the sight of them you tremble and are afraid, then confer your
case with them, for they upon a sure confidence of their God, are bold and
fearlesse, much more then you, who in all the time of this your ignorance, both
do worship other gods, and neglect the Religion of Immortality, and such
Christians as worship him, them you do drive out and persecute them unto death;
of these and such like matters many Presidents of our Provinces did write to
our Father of famous memory heretofore, to whom he directed his answer again,
willing them in no case to molest the Christians, except they were found in
some trespass prejudicial against the Empire of Rome; and to me also many
there be, which write signifying their mind in like manner, to whom I have
answered again to the same effect and manner as my Father did; wherefore if any
hereafter shall offer any vexation or trouble to such, having no other cause,
but only for that they are such, let him that is impeached be released, and
discharged free; Yea although he be found to be such (that is a Christian and
let the accuser sustain the punishment, etc.

Marcus Aurelius Antonius, Emperor to the Senate and People of Rome.
I Give you hereby to understand what I intend to do, as also what success I
have had in my wars in Germany, Page 46. Anno 175 in the 4th persecution.
and with how much difficulty I have victualled my Camp, being compassed about
with seventy and four fierce Dragons, whom my Scouts descried to be within nine
miles of us, and Pompeianus our Lieutenant has viewed, as he signified unto us
by his Letters; wherefore I thought no less, but to be overrun, and all my
bands of so great multitude, as well my vaward mainward, as rere-ward, with all
my Soldiers of Ephrata, in whose host there were numbered of fighting men, nine
hundred seventy and five thousand; But when I saw my self not able to encounter
with the enemy, I craved aid of our Country gods, at whose hands I finding no
comfort, and being driven of the Enemy unto an exigent, I caused to be sent for
those men which we call Christians, who being mustered were found a good
indifferent number, with whom I was in further rage then I had good cause, as
afterward I had experience, by their mavelous power, who forthwith did their
endeavor, but without either weapons munition, armor, or trumpets, as men
abhorring such preparations, and furniture, but only satisfied in trust of
their God, whom they carry about with them in their Consciences; It is
therefore to be credited, although we call them wicked men, that they worship
God in their hearts, for they falling prostrate upon the ground, prayed not
only for me, but for the host also which was with me, beseeching their God for
help, in that our extremity of victuals and fresh water, for we had been now
five days without water, and were in our Enemies Land, even in the midst of
Germany, who thus falling upon their faces made their Prayer to a God unknown
of me; And there fell amongst us from Heaven a most pleasant and cold shower,
but amongst our Enemies a great storm of hail mixed with lightning, so that
immediately we perceived the invincible hand of the most mighty God to be with
us; Therefore we gave those men leave to profess Christianity, least perhaps
by their Prayer we be punished with the like, and thereby make my self the
Author of such hurt as shall be received by the Christian profession; and if
any shall apprehend one that is a Christian only for that cause, I will that
he being apprehended, without punishment, may have leave to confess the same,
so that there be no other cause objected against him, more then that he is a
Christian, but let his accuser be burned alive, neither will I that he
confessing, and being found a Christian, shall be enforced to alter the same
his Opinion by the Governor of any of our Provinces, but left to his own
choice; and this decree of mine I will to be ratified in the Senate House, and
command the same publicly to be proclaimed and read in the Court of Trajanus;
and that further from thence it may be sent in all our Provinces by the
diligence of Varatious Governor of our City of Polione; and further we give
leave to all men to use and write out this our Decree, taking the same out of
our Copy, publicly in the common Hall set forth.

THe thing it self which in the sure and most firm Page 91. about An. 350 in
the 10th persecution.
Law of Nature is contained, does give unto all men (even as God has ordained
the same) sufficient perseverance and understanding, both of such things as man
ought to foresee, as also what things presently he ought to meditate, neither
is there any thing therein to be doubted, of such which have their minds
directed to the scope or work of perfect understanding; so that the perfect
comprehending of sound reason, and the perseverance thereof, be compared with
the Knowledge of God, being the True and Perfect Virtue; whereof let no wise
man be troubled, although be sees diverse men of diverse dispositions; for Wisdom
which springs of Virtue, cannot abide or acquaint her self with fond Idiots,
unless that (on the other side) the malice of perverse litherness prolong her
days, and cause the same Idiocy to survive; wherefore assuredly the Crown and
Price of Virtue lies open unto all men, and the most Mighty God orders the
judgment of the same: I undoubtedly (as manifestly as possible is) will
endeavor my self to testify and confess unto you, all the hope which is in
me; I think verily that the Emperors which before this time have lately been,
even for their Tyranny had the Empire taken from them, and my Father only
exercising and used all meekness and lenity in his affairs, calling upon God
the Father with great devotion and humility, has been exalted to the same, and
all the rest as men wanting their wits, and in comparison as savige Beasts,
rather did give themselves to like cruelty, then unto any lenity and gentleness
toward their Subjects, in which Tyranny every one for his time being nosuled,
utterly subverted the True and Unfallible Doctrine, and so great malice was
there kindled in their Breasts, that when all things were in peaceable
tranquality, they made and raised most cruel and bloody intestine or civil
Wars; it is credibly informed us, that in those days Apollo gave Answers, but
not by any man's Mouth, but out of a certain Cave and dark place, (saying) that
he was much disquietted by those that were the just men and livers upon the
Earth, so that he could or would not for them declare a truth of such things as
others demanded, and hereby it came to pass that such false divinations were
given from the golden Tables in Apollo's Temple, and in this thing did his
Prophetical Priest complain of, when he took up again the hair of his head that
others had contemptuously cast down? And that the neglecting of his divination
was the cause of so many evils amongst men; but let us see what was the end
hereof; we now boldly and without all fear invocate and worship the omnipotent
God. When I was a Child I heard that he which then was chief Emperor of Rome,
unhappy, yea most unhappy man, being seduced and brought into error by his
Soldiers, curiously enquired who were those just men upon the earth that
Apollo meant, and one of his Priests which was near about him, made answer that
they were the Christians; this answer hereupon unto him being as delectable as
honey unto the mouth, drew the sword given unto him to be revenged upon evil
doers and malefactors, against the Professors of the irreprehensible Sanctimony
and Religion, and straightway he gave forth a Commission (to bloody homicides
as I may well call them) and gave commandment to all the Judges, that they
should endeavor themselves with all the cunning they had, to the devising of
more grievous and sharper punishment against the poor Christians; then, then I
say, a man might have seen how greatly the honest professors of that Religion
were molested with cruelty, and daily suffered no small injuries and
contumelies, and that also they suffered and sustained the same with such
temperance, as though they had had no injuries done unto them at all, which
temperance and patience of theirs was the cause why the furious Citizens were
the more mad and raging against them; what fires, what tortures, what kind of
torments were there, but they without respect either of age or sex were
enforced to feel?

Then did the earth without doubt her self bewail her Children, and the round
world which contains all things, being sprinkled and imbrued with their
blood, made doleful lamentation for them, and the day it self provoked for to
mourn was made amazed for them, but what is this to purpose? Now the very
barbarous Nations rejoice for their sakes, which received and harbored them
when they were afraid and fled from us, keeping them as it were in most loving
and amiable Captivity, and they saved not only their lives, but also were a
defense for their Religion; and now also the Roman Nation remembers, and has
before their eyes this blame and spot, which the Christians that were of that
time worthily gave unto them, when they by them were banished (as unfit members
of their Common wealth) amongst the barbarous people; what needs to make
further rehearsal of the mourning lamentation which the Heathen people
themselves throughout all the world made for the pitiful murder and slaughter
of them? After that it came to pass, that they which were Authors of all these
mischiefs died also, and were committed for their reward to the most filthy and
horrible Dungeon of Hell, they being so entangled with intestine and civil
wars, left alive neither name nor kinsman of their own, which thing undoubtedly
had not chanced, unless the wicked devinations of Apollo's Oracles had
deceived and bewitched them; To thee therefore now I pray, Oh most mighty God,
that thou will vouchsafe to be merciful, and pardon all the East parts, and
Inhabitants of the same, being oppressed with calamity, and that by me thy
Servant thou will of thy goodness help and relieve the same; and these things
rashly crave I not at thy hands, Oh Lord most mighty, and holiest God of all,
for I being persuaded by the only Oracles, have both begun and also finished
wholesome and profitable things; and further, by the bearing and showing of
thine Ensign, have overcome a mighty and strong Host, and when any necessity of
the Commonweal (to my charge committed) requires thereunto (following those
signs and tokens of thy virtues) I boldly go forth and fight against mine
Enemies; and for this cause have I sacrificed my-soul unto thee, purified and
cleansed both with thy love and fear; Yea truly, thy Name do I sincerely love,
and thy power do I reverence, which by many tokens and wonders has showed and
confirmed thereby my belief and faith; Therefore will I do my endeavor, and
bend my self thereunto, that I may re-edifie thy most holy House, which those
wicked and ungodly Emperors, have with so great ruin laid waste; thy people do
I desire to bring and establish in firm peace and tranquillity, and that for
the public utility of all the Inhabitants of the earth, those which yet err,
and are out of the way, enjoy the benefit of peace and quietness with and
amongst the number of the faithful sort, for I trust the restitution of the
like society and participation may be a means to bring them also that err into
the perfect way of verity; Let no man therefore be grievous one unto another,
but whatever man thinks best, that let him do, for such as are wise ought
thoroughly to be persuaded, that they only mean to live holily, and as they
should do, whom the Spirit of God moves to take their delight and recreation
in reading his holy will; and if others wilfully will go out of the way,
cleaving to the Synagogues of false doctrine, they may at their own peril; as
for us we have the most worthy house, or congregation of Gods verity, which he
according to his own goodness and nature has given us; and this also we wish
unto them, that with like participation and common consent, they may feel with
us the same delectation of mind; for this our Religion is neither new nor newly
invented, but is as old as we believe the Creation of the world to be, and
which God has commanded to be celebrated with such worship as both seemed and
pleased him; but all living men are Liars, and are deceived with diverse and
sundry delusions; Thou O God for Christ thy Sons sake, suffer not this
wickedness again to root, thou have set up a clear and burning Light, that
thereby as many as thou have chosen may come unto thee, these thy miracles
approved the same, it is thy power that keeps us in innocence and fidelity,
the Sun and the Moon run their appointed course, neither yet in ranging wise
wander the Stars to what place of the world they list themselves, the days,
years, months and times keep their appointed turns, the earth abides firm and
unremovable at thy word, and the wind at the time (by thee directed) stormeth
and blows, the streaming watering floods ebb in time according as they flow,
the raging Sea abides within her bounds and limits, and for that the Ocean Sea
stretches out her self in equal length and breadth with the whole earth, this
must needs be wrought with some mavelous workmanship of thine own hand, which
thing unless it were at thy will made and disposed, without all doubt so great
difference and partition between would ere this time have brought utter ruin
and destruction both to the life of man, as to all that belongs to man
beside, which for that they have such great and huge conflicts amongst
themselves, as also the invisible Spirits have; We give thee thanks O Lord most
mighty, God of all Gods, that all mankind has not been destroyed thereby;
Surely even as greatly as thy benignity and gentleness is manifested by diverse
and sundry benefits bestowed upon us, so much also is the same set forth and
declared in the discipline of thy eternal Word to those that be heavenly wise,
and apply themselves to the attainment of sincere and true virtue; but if any
such there be that little regard, or have but small respect unto the
consideration thereof, let them not blame or lay a fault in others that do the
same; for that Physic whereby health is obtained, is manifestly offered unto
all men; Now therefore let no man go about to subvert that which experience it
self does show (of necessity) to be pure and good; Let us therefore altogether
use the participation of this benefit bestowed upon us, that is to say, the
benefit of peace and tranquillity, setting apart all controversy, and let no
man hurt or be prejudicial to his fellow for that thing wherein he thinks
himself to have done well, if by that which any man knows and has experience
of, he thinks he may profit his neighbor, let him do the same, if not let
him give over, and remit it till another time, for there is a great diversity
betwixt the willing and the voluntary embracing of Religion, and that when a
man is thereunto informed, and counseled; of these things have I made a more
large discourse, than indeed the scope and mediocrity requires, especially
because I would not have my faith (touching the verity) to be hid, for that I
hear there be some which complain the old accustomed haunting of their Temples,
and that the power of such darkness is cut off and taken away, which thing
surely I would take in better part, were it not that the violent rebellion of
flagitious error were so fixed in many men's hearts, whereby they thirst after
the utter subversion of the Commonweal and Empire.

and freedom of Religion, ought not in any case to be prohibited, but that free
leave ought to be given to every man to do therein, according to his will and
mind; We have given commandment to all men to qualify matters of Religion as
they themselves thought good, and that also the Christians should keep the
opinions and Faith of their Religion; but because that many and sundry opinions
by the same our first License spring and increase through such liberty granted,
We thought good manifestly to add thereunto, and make plain such things whereby
perchance some of them in time to come may from such their observance be let or
hindered; When therefore by prosperous success, I Constantinus Augustus; and I
Linicius Augustus came to Mediliolanum, and there sat in Council upon such
things as served for the utility and profit of the Commonweal, these things
amongst others we thought would be beneficial to all men, yea and before all
other things we purposed to establish those things wherein the true Reverence
and Worship of God is comprehended, that is, to give unto the Christians free
choice to follow what Religion they think good, and whereby the same sincerity
and celestial grace, which is in every place received, may also be embraced and
accepted of all our loving Subjects; according therefore unto this our pleasure
upon good advisement and sound judgment, we have Decreed, that no man so hardy
be denied to choose and follow the Christian observance or Religion, but that
this liberty be given to every man, that he may apply his mind to what Religion
he thinks meet himself, whereby God may perform upon us all his accustomed
care and goodness; To the intent therefore you might know that this is our
pleasure, We thought it necessary this to write unto you, whereby all such
errors and opinions being removed, which in our former Letters being sent unto
you in the behalf of the Christians are contained, and which seem very
undescreet and contrary to our clemency may be made frustrate and annihilate;
Now therefore firmly and freely We will and command, that every man have a free
liberty to observe the Christian Religion, and that without any grief or
molestation he may be suffered to do the same. These things have we thought
good to signify unto you by as plain words as we may, that we have given to
the Christians, free and absolute power to keep and use their Religion; and for
so much as this liberty is absolutely given of us unto them, to use and
exercise their former observance, if any be disposed, it is manifest that the
same helps much to establish the public tranquillity of our time, every man
to have License and liberty to use and choose what kind of worshipping he list
himself; and this is done of us only for the intent that we would have no man
to be enforced to one Religion more than another; and this thing also amongst
others we have provided for the Christians, that they may have again the
possession of such places in which heretofore they have been accustomed to make
their Assemblies; so that if any have bought or purchased the same either of us
or of any other, the same places without either money or other recompense
forthwith and without delay We will to be restored again unto the said
Christians; And if any man have obtained the same by gift from us, and shall
require any recompense to be made to them in that behalf, then let the
Christians repair to the President, being the Judge appointed for that place,
that consideration may be had of those men by our benignity; all which things
we Will and Command that you see to be given and restored freely, and with
diligence unto the society of the Christians, all delay set apart; And because
the Christians themselves are understood to have had not only those places
wherein they were accustomed to resort together, but certain other peculiar
places also, not being private to any one man, but belonging to the right of
their Congregation and Society; You shall see also all those to be restored
unto the Christians, that is to say, to every Fellowship and Company of them,
according to the Decree whereof we have made mention, all delay set apart;
Provided that the order we have taken in the mean time be observed, that if
any, taking no recompense, shall restore the same Lands and Possessions, they
shall not mistrust, but be sure to be saved harmless by us. In all these
things it shall be your part to employ your diligence in the behalf of the
foresaid company of Christians, whereby this our commandment may speedily be
accomplished, and also in this case by our clemency the common and public
peace may be preserved; for undoubtedly by this means, as before we have said,
the good will and favor of God toward us (whereof in many cases we have had
good experience) shall always continue with us; And to the intent that this
our Constitution may be notified to all men, it shall be requisite that the
copy of these our Letters be set up in all places, that men may read and know
the same, least any should be ignorant thereof.

of the Commonwealth we established, we commanded to reform all things
according to the ancient Laws and public Discipline of the Romans; And also
to use this policy, that the Christians, which had forsaken the Religion of
their Forefathers, should be brought again to the right way, for such
fantastical singularity was amongst them, that those things which their Elders
had received and allowed, they rejected and disallowed, devising every man such
Laws as they thought good, and observed the same, assembling in diverse places
great multitudes of people; Therefore when our foresaid Decree was Proclaimed,
many there were that felt the penalty thereof, and many being troubled
therefore suffered many kinds of death; And because we see yet that there be
many which persevere in the same which neither give due worship unto the
celestal Gods, neither receive the God of the Christians, we having respect to
our accustomed benignity, wherewith we are wont to show favor unto all men,
think good in this case also to extend our clemency, that the Christians may be
again tolerated, and appoint them places where again they may meet together, so
that they do nothing contrary to public order and discipline; By another
Epistle we mean to prescribe unto the Judges, what shall be convenient for them
to do; Wherefore according as this our bountiful clemency deserves, let them
make Intercession to God for our Health, Commonweal, and for themselves, that
in all places the state of the Commonweal may be preserved, and that they
themselves may be able safely to live within their bounds. Eusebius. lib. 6. cap.

THe Majesty of our most gracious and Sovereign Lords the Emperors has lately
decreed with special diligence and devotion, to induce all men to a uniform
life, that they which seemed to dissent from the Roman custom by a straying
manner of living, should exhibit to the immortal Gods their due and proper
worship; but the wilful and obstinate mind of diverse so much and so continually
resisted the same, that by no lawful means they might be revoked from their
purpose, neither made afraid by any terror or punishment; because therefore it
so came to pass, that by this means many put themselves in peril and in
jeopardy; the Majesty of our Sovereign Lords the Emperors, according to their
noble piety, considering that it was far from their Princely Majesty's, that
such things should be, whereby so many men and much people should be destroyed,
gave me in charge that with diligence I should write unto you, that, if any of
the Christians from henceforth fortune to be taken in the exercise of their
Religion, that in no no wise you molest the same, neither for that cause do you
judge any man worthy of punishment, for that in all this time it has evidently
appeared, that by no means they might be allured from such wilfulness; It is
therefore requisite that your wisdom write unto the Questor, Captains and
Constables of every City and Village, that they may know it not to be Lawful
for them to do contrary to the prescript of this commandment, neither that they
presume to attempt the same, Eusebius lib. 9. cap.
