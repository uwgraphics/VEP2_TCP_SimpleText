A Word from the Lord, Unto all the faithless Generation of the World, who
know not the Truth, but live in their own imaginations; with a true Declaration
of the true faith, and in what it does differ from the Worlds imagination:
written in obedience to the Lord, that al may see what faith is owned by the
Saints, and what faith is denied.

And also a few words unto all Professors of the World, who worship not the
true God, but their own imaginations and conceivings instead of the true God:
Also a Call from God unto all the World to Repentance, that all may turn unto
him, lest the Lord destroy both Root and Branch of them that repent not.

Also a few words unto you that scorn Quaking and Trembling, which all the
holy men of God witnessed that spoke forth the Scripture, and also the holy men
of God justified, and all you denied that scorneth such as witness such things
now, as ever was in all the Generations of the Saints.

With a word to those that are called Anabaptists, Independants, Presbyterians,
Levellers, and Ranters, that they may turn to the Lord, by yielding obedience
to the light in their Consciences.

By those whom the World knows by the names of George Fox, and James Nailor.

Printed in the Year, 1654.

To all the faithless generation of the world, and to all who desire to know
what faith and hope we live in and what faith and hope we deny.
THat Faith we own and witness, is that which stands in Jesus Christ in the
everlasting Covenant of light, John. 1.9.
who is the light of the world and has enlightened every one that comes into
the world, and this light we believe and follow, and by this are we led out of
all the ways, works, and worships, John. 8.12
of this dark world, and the effect of this light we witness by faith. And by
this faith we deny all who say this light is not sufficient without the
teaching of man to guide in all the ways of God, and all such we deny, John.
10.4.5. Tim. 4.5.
for those are they who know not the voice of Christ, and therefore here a
stranger and hireling who heap up teachers having itching ears who cannot
endure sound doctrine, and in this Christ we believe, who is our life and
Salvation; and all them and their faith we deny, who say they have faith, and
their lives is not the life of Christ, but live in sin, and worldly pleasures,
and say they cannot be saved from their sins in this world, but in part, and
this faith we deny and them, 1. John 3.8. Heb. 7.25. 1. Timo. 1.9.
for these deny the end of Christ's coming in the flesh who cannot believe he is
able to save to the uttermost all that come unto him, and this faith is
reprobate, and these deny the Lord that bought them, and have made shiprack of
faith and a good conscience and makes the blood of Christ of no effect to them
who are not cleansed by it, and all them and their faith we deny who say they
believe and know the will of God, but they have not power, Romans 1.4.16.
for that Christ in which we believe is the great power of God unto Salvation
in all that believe, and who has this Christ has power, and in him we have
power to do the will of God, but these are they that know not Christ nor his
power, 2. Tim. 3.5.
but run into notions and forms but deny the power, and from such we turn away,
for such know not him in them who is greater then he that is in the world, but
are wi ling to serve sin and be led Captive at the devils will, not minding
the light and power of Christ to be guided by it, and then would seem to cast
the fault on God, as though he had given a Christ that was not able to set free
til after death, and these put him to open sha^e whose faith and profession we
deny, Romans 5.17. Romans 1.22. Romans 10 3.4.
and we deny all who say they have faith in Christ, and yet their righteousness
is not perfect, but this faith we witness which receives the righteousness of
God, even the free gift of righteousness by Jesus Christ, and this is perfect
which is the righteousness of faith, and all who have not this righteousness
are in the false righteousness which is not perfect, and these are short of the
righteousness of God, and would establish their own righteousness, and these
are the Boasters who would justify themselves and despise others, Romans 1.27.
but by the righteousness of faith is boasting excluded, and here is no
justifying of self, but denying self and self righteousness and exalting the
righteousness of God, which is perfect which is in Christ Jesus, Phil. 1.9.
Phil. 1.11.
who is made unto us righteousness and sanctification, and by this faith we
deny all who say they have Christ, and have not this righteousness, but whose
righteousness is unperfect, and that Christ and that righteousness we deny
which is not perfect, and witness that Christ in which we are made the
righteousness of God, and this Christ is our righteousness and perfection, and
this faith we own and witness, which is not a talk of faith, as the worlds
professors, who say they have faith but are dead in sin and cannot witness the
work of God in them, Jam. 2.26. Ephesians. 2.10. 1. John. 5.4. Gal. 1.4..
but that faith we own which is lively by which the work of God is witnessed
in us working out sin, and by which we are his workmanship created in Christ
Jesus unto good works, and this is our faith by which we overcome the world,
and the Devil, and all you we deny who have a profession in the world, and in
whom the works of the Devil are brought forth, and their faith and hope we
deny who say they hope to be saved but live in sin making a profession, and
this is the hope of the hypocrite which shall perrish, and not the hope of
Christ, for he that has this hope of Christ purifies himself even as he is
pure, 1. John 3.3. Heb. 6.19
and this faith and hope we own which purifies the heart and enters into the
place of holiness within the veil, but that which is without holiness, we deny
which is not in Christ, but in a vain mind, To. 10.8.
and we deny all who say they have faith and Christ, and yet their word and
light is without them, and that word we witness which is nigh in the heart, and
this is the word of faith, which the Apostles preached, and he that has Christ
or faith, has this word, which is Christ the light not in letter but in
spirit, and all them we deny whose law is without and morrall, and that law we
witness which is spiritual written in the heart, and this law is perfect and
endures for ever, Heb. 8.10.11. Heb. 7.19.
and all the Changeable laws we deny, and all whose Law is without we see to
be in the old Covenant of works, which made nothing perfect, and the self
righteousness which is filthy rags, and by the light of Christ are we
convinced of that righteousness not to be of faith, therefore whose faith and
works stand here, them we deny and see them all worshipping without the new
covenant in the oldness of the letter, whose law is without, 1. Cor. 12.13. 1.
Cor. 14.13.
their light without, their Church, without, their Baptism, prayers, and
Singings without, their Christ without, their righteousness without, and so
their faith without, all which we witness to be within, and within we worship
in newness of spirit, and by this spirit we do see all that are without God and
his righteousness, to be in the world, and strangers to the covenant of grace,
Ioh. 4.23.24.
and that faith and worship, we deny and God denies, who seeks such worshippers
as worship in spirit and truth, and this faith and worship we own not known
to the world, and therefore hated.

To all the Worlds Professors and People, that you may see where you are and
Repent.
THe word of God is not known to the world, nor worldly wisdom; he that has
the word has life, he that knows the word knows God, and heeres life
manifest, and the word has quickened him and raised him out of death and dead
works, he that has but the letter hears the sound, but knows not where or
what it is, and as he received it in the air, he declares it, and death
speaks light words without power, and dead works and lightness is brought
forth, and the power of death raines, and the life of that is but an imitation
and not the life it self, the chafe but not the grains tossed in the wind,
and the Prince of the air is fed and rules, and here vanity is exalted, the
light mind is fed with airie notions, would be wise but the colt is at liberty,
not subject to the yoke but kicks against the pure, and the obedience is not,
and the cross is despised, but the nature who feeds here whose end is for
destruction and for the fire, for the nature knows not the living word but the
letter, and is without God in the world, but he who has the word has God and
is come into the Covenant by which all things stand, for he is come into the
beginning out of the fall to the first fruits, and witnesses the word
spiritual, invisible, powerful, pure, and sharp, a divider and discerner by
it he is sanctified and made clean, by it he is established and unmooveable and
is fed daily, it is his life, his joy and delight, and the word is not to fetch
from above nor from below neither is it to seek it in a chapter or a
steeplehouse without, but it is nigh in the heart, and in the mouth, by which
word he is kept at all seasons, it is his counselor and he inquires at it, as
at an Oracle, and thereby he is brought to live the life of Godliness and from
which is spoken words of life and power to others, and he speaks not his own
words, nor brings forth his own works: but has ceased from his own works
as God did from his and is entered into his rest, and is come into the eternal
Sabbath, and is comprehended into the word which is Christ, and is no more his
own, for now Christ speaks in him, acts in him, and works in him the will
and the deed; now Christ and he is one married to him, and Christ is his head
and husband, and now the head speaks prays and prayseth, and prophesies, and
is uncovered and here is the Church of the first borne the pillar and ground
of truth, where the woman must be covered and kept silent and is not to speak
in the Church, is not to usurp authority, but is to be in subjection, and if
she would know any thing let her ask of her husband at home, and he is to her
a covering of the eyes forever. Now all you Priests and People that talk of
these things without you from the letter, this is a parable to you and you
read the outside in the letter and from that you imagine and so set up a form
or likeness or image of those things, and here you worship, and for this you
contend and would compel all to worship your image you have set up, and you
go about to persecute and destroy all that will not worship and bow down to
it with you, but it is the form you have, but not the substance, and you put
the dead letter for the living word, and your meanings of it arising from the
brains, and first wisdom and natural learning, thus you declare and call it
prophesying and put off your hats which is carnal, but the head you know not,
and it is the woman that speaks and the head is covered, and so you dishonor
your head and honor your selves, neither are you subject to your head, but
your own will rules in you, and you live in the pleasures of the world, and
are become wanton, and have set your eyes upon many lovers, and you are
adulterated from your husband nor live not with him, nor is he a covering to
you neither can you witness him in you nor you in him, nor the pure seed of God
is not brought forth in you, but the seed that is accursed, neither is the pure
language brought forth in you, but as to God you are smitten with barrenness
and brings forth nothing but words, winds, shows and shadows, imitations,
inventions, imaginations and conceptions, and you never look to bring forth
better fruit, never come to holiness and perfection, and your first fruits, and
that estate wherein you were created, and you will not know you are departed
from your first fruitfullness, and have lost him in whom your life stands, and
in whom your fruits is found, and are become widows, and desolate as to your
first husband, and have been running after other lovers, and worshipping under
every green tree, and the holy flesh is departed from you, and you are doting
upon the Egyptian and the Assyrian for wisdom and strength, whose flesh is as
the flesh of horses, and have been as fed hoses living in the lust of the flesh
as it is at this day.

Now all people stand still a while and see from whence you are fallen, and the
cause of all your unfruitfulness and return to your first husband from whence
you are fallen, that you may bring forth your first fruits; for till then all
you do is abomination to the Lord, and he cannot accept it, for what you bring
forth is the seed of the adulterer and of the whore, a generation of evil
doers, and yet you make a profession in out side as to righteousness and
holiness, but the power is to act righteousness, you have not but in your
actions brought forth but the image of the Devil, for all sin bears his
image, and he is the father of it, let no man deceive you thorough fair
words, he that sins is of the Devil, and is doing his work, and upon this
image where it is, the wrath of God is revealed from heaven in flames of fire,
here is your portion you workers of iniquity.

THe word of the Lord God to all you that scorn trembling and quaking* and
scoff at them, and scorn at them, and throw stones at them who own trembling
and quaking, and ^^^ere that you might be seen to be strangers from all the
Apostles and Prophets in the generation that stoned them, mocked them then in
that age, and those ages and those times, but now ye are the scoffers that are
come in the last times whom they spoke of, be ye witnesses against your
selves, to the light in all your consciences, I speak, that with it you may
see your selves to be from the life of the holy men of God: Moses who was a
judge over all Israel, he feared, trembled, and quiked, when the Lord said
unto him, I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob; then he
trembled and durst not behold, at this which makes to tremble now: ye teachers
and people scoff at and scorn them now in your streets, who witness the
power of the Lord. And Moses forsook the pleasures of the world which he
might have enjoyed for a season, he might have beeene called the son of
Pharahoes daughter, he refused it and forsook Pharaoes house who was no
vagabond.

And David he trembled, he was mocked, they made songs on him, they wagged
their heads at him, will you profess David's words, Moses words, who are in
the generation of your fathers, mockers, scoffers, wonderers, and despisers,
who are to perish; Oh! blush and be ashamed of all your profession: Job
trembled, and their flesh trembled, and they mocked him, so do you now where
the same power of God is made manifest, and do not you mock and yet you
profess Jobs words? Oh! deceitful Hypocrites, will ye not own the
Scripture, Solomon who was a King said when the keepers of the house shall
tremble and the strong men of the house should bow themselves, and at this
Priests and Magistrates, and people scoff at, where this power makes the
keepers of the house to tremble, and the strong man to bow himself, Oh! for
shame never profess Solomon's words and deny the power, for with it you are
judged (with the power and life) Jeremiah he shook, his bones quaked, he
reeled too and fro like a drunken man, when he saw the deceits of the Priests,
and Prophets, who were turned from the way of God and they were not ashamed,
neither could they blush; such were gone from the light, and such were the
women that ruled over the people, and he was brought to cry oh foolish people
who had eyes and could not see! they had ears and did not hear, that did not
fear the Lord and tremble at his presence who placed the sands for the bounds
of the Sea for a perpetual decree, that the waves thereof cannot pass, and
said a horrible and filthy thing was committed in the Land, the Priests bate
rule by their means, and the Prophets prophecy falsely, shall not I visit for
these things says the Lord? shall not my soul be avenged upon such a Nation
as this? such did not tremble at the word of the Lord, therefore he called them
a foolish people, hear all ye the word of the Lord, ye foolish People who
scorn trembing, and quaking, and quaking, and shaking; give over Jeremiahs
words and making, a trade of them, for with his words ye are judged to be
among the scoffers and scorners, and stockers, for he was stocked by your
generation, and so you stock (who are the children of your fathers) them that
tremble now at the word of the Lord, at the power of the mighty God, which
rayses up the seed of God out of the fall, and throws down the earth which
has kept it in the fall; so you that are in the fall where death reigns
enemies of the truth, despising the power of God as ever your generation did;
woe and misery is your portion except you speedily repent.

And Isaiah said hear ye the word of the Lord, all ye that tremble at his
word, and said, this is the man that God regards, that was of a broken and
contrite heart and tremble at his word, when their brethren hated them, and
persecuted them, and cast them out saying, let the Lord be glorified he shall
appear to your glory but they shall be ashamed.

Now to all scoffers and scorners that despise trembling, you regard not the
word of the Lord, they are not regarded with you that trembles at the word who
are regarded of the Lord, therefore ye are contrary to Isaiah his words,
therefore never for shame profess him nor his words, nor make a trade of his
words, ye who seek for your gain from your quarter, ye greedy dumb dogs
that never have enough, ye are they that despise trembling, you are they
Isaiah cried against who witnessed trembling, and here be you witnesses
against your selves, that with the light in your consciences you may see you
are out of the Prophet Isaiahs words and are such as hate them that tremble,
that the Lord regards but such you do not regard, but hate, and persecute,
mock and rail against, but it is manifest that you walk in the steps of your
fathers who persecuted the Prophets, Habacuck the Prophet of the Lord, and Joel
the Prophet of the Lord, blew the trumphet in Zion and let the inhabitants of
the earth tremble, the people shall tremble, and all faces shall gather
blackness and the people shall be much pained, and now this trembling is
witnessed by the power of the Lord, this power of the Lord is come, the trumpet
is sounding the Devils are trembling, the earth is shaking, the dead is
raising, and the living is praising God, and the world is rageing, and the
scoffers are scorning, and them who witness trembling and quaking, can scarce
pass up and down the streets, but with stones, and blows, and sticks, and
fists, or mocks or dogs, or reproaches, and thus you vent forth your malice
against them who witness the power of the Lord, as the Prophets did, to come
to the broken heart and contrice spirit, and tremble at the word of the Lord
whom the Lord regards them you stone, them you stock, them you set your dogs
at, and scoff, and scorn, revile and reproach, but the reproaches are our
riches, and praised be the Lord who has given us power above all, and if you
see one as Habac^uck whose lips quivered, whose belly shook, who said
rottenness entered into his bones, who trembled in himself, if you see such an
one in this age now, you say he is bewitched, here again you show your selves
strangers to that power, to that life that was in the Prophet, and so for shame
never make a profession of his words, nor a trade of his words nor of Joels who
witnessed trembling, that which ye scoff and scorn. Ye proud scoffers and
scorners, ah! misery misery is your end, except you speedily repent. And Daniel
a servant of the most high God, he trembled, his strength and his breath was
gone, he was imprisoned, he was hated, he was persecuted, they laid baits
and snares for him, in whom the Holy Spirit of God was, now for shame all you
that make a profession of Daniels words, give over your profession Priests and
people who scoffs and scorns at trembling, with the light you are seen to
be out of Daniels life and by the same power, you are threshed, for it you
scorn and scoff, and so here again be witness that you are scorners and
scoffers against the truth, and with the Scripture you are judged to be
contrary to the life of the holy men of God, and Paul a minister of God made by
the will of God, a messenger of the Lord Jesus, a vessel of the Lord to cause
his name to spread abroad in several Nations, when the dark blind world have
got some of his words and epistles, and you filthy teachers make a trade of
them and gets great sums of money for it, and so destroys souls for
dishonest gain, and making a trade of his words, and the rest of the Apostles
and Prophets and Christ, but denying that Spirit and life that they were guided
by, and that power that shook the flesh and the earth which the Apostles
witnessed who said when he came among the Corinthians he was then with them
in weakness, and fear and in much trembling, that their faith might not stand
in the wisdom of the world, but in the power of God, in that power which made
him to tremble, at this power the world and all the scoffing teachers scoff at
in the towns, in your villages, in your assemblies, in your alehouses, for
shame lay away all your profession of the Apostles words and conditions, and
some scoffs at the power and call it of the Devil, and some persecute them,
stock, stone, imprison, and whip, in whom that power is made manifest, and
loades them with reproaches as not to walk on the earth, the off-scowring of
the world hated and persecuted, here you may see you are in the steps of your
forefathers who persecuted the Apostles and acted so against them, stocked
them, mocked them, imprisoned them, stoned them, whipped them, hayled them out
of the Synagogues, reproached them, shamefully entreated them, do not you
here fulfill the Scripture and Christ's sayings, who says if they kill you
they think they do good service, and yet you make a profession of Christ's
words, the Prophets and Apostles words, and calls your selves Churches and
ministers of the Gospel; I command you and charge you in the presence of the
living God, to be silent who acts such things, scoffers and scorners, mind the
light in your consciences, which Christ has enlightened you withal, that by
it you may see your selves what you act and what you have acted, for who act
such things shall never inherit the Kingdoms of God, for all such things with
the light are condemned, and who come to witness trembling and quaking, the
powers of the earth to be shaken, the lustful to come to be destroyed, the
scorning and scoffing come to be judged with the light in it, wait, to receive
power, who shakes the earth, this power we own and faith stands in it, which
all the world scoffs at, the lusty ones, the proud ones, the presumptuous
ones, who live in presumption, and yet make a profession of the Scr^pture as
your Fathers the Pha^ses did, who were painted Serpents, and the Scribes who
had the chiefest places in the assemblies, stood praying in the Synagogues,
called of men Masters, which Christ cried woe against, who are not come so far
as the trembling of D^vels, which believed and trembled, let that Judge you the
light and life of the Scripture is seen and made manifest, that with it all
you scoffers, and all you scorners, and all persecutors and raylers are seen;
take warning all ye powers of the earth how you persecute them whom the world
nicknames and calls Quakers, who dwells in the eternal power of God, left the
hand of the Lord be turned against you, and ye be all cut off, and to you this
is the word of God, to fear and to tremble and to take warning, for this is
the man that the Lord does regard, who trembles at his word, which you who are
of the world, scoffs and scorns, stocks, persecutes, imprisons, here you may
see you are contrary to God, contrary to the Prophets, and are such who hate
what the Lord regards, whom we own, whom the world scorns; and calls Quakers,
and set up that power, and honor that power that makes the Devils to tremble,
and shakes the earth and throws down the haughtiness of man, and which makes
the beasts of the field to tremble, and makes the Earth reele too and fro, and
cleaves the Earth asunder, and overturnes the wo^ld, this power we own and
honor and set up which the world scornfully calls Quakers; but all scoffers
and persecutors and raylers, and scorners, and stockers and whippers, we deny
with that power which throws down all that nature, as seeing all who act such
things are for destruction and shall never inherit the kingdom of God, so
rejoice all ye righteous ones which are persecuted for righteousness sake, for
great is your reward in Heaven, rejoice ye that suffer for well doing, for ye
shall not lose your reward; and wait you in the light that you may grow up in
the life that gave forth all the Scriptures that with it you may see all the
Saints conditions, and with it you may see all that which they testified
against, and therewith it you will see them that did reproach and scoff them and
mock them, and persecute them, and whip them, and stock them, and hail them
out of the Synagogues, before magistrates, so to you who are in the same light
and life, the same things do they unto you now, that they may fill up the
measure of their fathers, so with the light now they are seen to act where the
light and life and power of God is made manifest, for as they did unto them, so
shall they do unto you, and here is our joy and the Scripture fulfilled and
fulfilling, and with the light which was before the world, which is now made
manifest in the children of light, with it they see the world and comprehends
it, and all things in it, and the actions of it, and with the light we see it
to be for the fire, and all the works of it; for he that loves it and turns
himself from the light is an enemy to God, he turns into wickedness for the
whole world lies in wickedness, he turns into the works of evil, who turns
from the light, he is with the light, which is of Christ testified against,
and to this light being made manifest, all the works of the world are seen
and made manifest, and here is joy and unity and light, rejoice in Trembling
and rejoice above all the world.

This is to go amongst the scattered ones, and amongst all the world.

A word to those that are called Anabaptists, Independants, Presbyterians,
Levellers, and Ranters.
THe word of the Lord God to you, which are called Ranters, you had a pure
convincement, I witness, which did convince you, but having fled the Cross,
and now to it are become enemies, which turns the grace of God into
wantonness, and follows drunckenness, and cursed speaking, sporting your
selves in the daytime, following oaths and swearing, you never come into the
Sons doctrine, had a convincement under the law, then start up to be as Gods
and never came thorough the Prophets, nor Moses house, nor Christ who is the
end of all oaths, for you that are in the oaths, and your drunckenness the
law of God is cast behind your back, and you that are in your wantonness kill
the just, and you that live in pleasures are dead while you live, and you that
swear are out of Christ's doctrine, with the light which was before the world
was, with it I do you comprehend, which is your eternal condemnation who be in
the liberty of the flesh in your hot burning lusts, but all such are beggarly
acted in that nature contrary to the light, and with the light to be condemned
and to you this is the word of the Lord.

And the word of the Lord to you who are called Levellers, you had a flash in
your mind, a simplicity, and your minds run into the earth and smothered it,
and so got up into presumption, and you would had unity and fellowship there,
before life was raised up in you, so that withers, and much of it is withered
as it is manifest and with the light, that is condemned, in which light is the
unity of both those conditions.

The word of the Lord to you who are called Anabaptists, you take up a command
from the letter, and say Christ commands it which Christ did not, you command;
but the letter commands it, you are not led with the light, which gave forth
those commands to observe them, but says Christ has commanded them in
Scripture, here you are them which use their tongues which the Scripture speaks
of, but I have not spoken to them says the Lord, here with the light you are
comprehended, to be the witches which takes up commands as they did in the
Galathians, which the Apostle speaks of which did bewitch them, who draws from
the spirit within them, to harken to your outward commands, them that did
observe the commands was led by the spirit, and Christ bid them go preach, he
sent them and bid them go preach the Gospel to every Creature, they did not
go at the command of the letter, but at the command of Christ, and they was
led by the light which did comprehend the world, and the Prophets they did not
go because other Prophets had gone and take their words, and make a trade of
them nor used their tongues, and say he said when the Lord had not spoken unto
them, but with the light they did them comprehend, and cry against, and the
Lord bid them cry aloud and spare not, lift up their voice like a trumpet, and
show them their sins and transgressions which walked contrary to the light, with
the light they are comprehended, and all you who are turned from the light, and
says Christ says so and so, and the Prophets and Apostles said so in such a
Chapter and such a verse, and God said so, and the command is in such a Chapter
and such a verse, here with the light you are comprehended and seen to be them
who use their tongues, and say he says it, when the Lord never spoke to you,
here you are comprehended with the light, and seen to be liars, and are for
the lake where all liars must go, and to you this is the word of the Lord.

The word of the Lord God to you that are called Independants, your zeal it
without the knowledge of God, with the life of God I bear you record that you
depend upon your imaginations, you depend upon the letter, your minds are
turned from the light of Christ within you, and that zeal and knowledge with
the light which never changes, which comprehends the world with it, it shall be
condemned, your knowledge, wisdom and zeal: for the zeal, wisdom, and
knowledge which stands, is in the light, which condemns that knowledge, wisdom
and zeal in that nature that acts contrary to the light, which changes not,
and to you this is the word of the Lord God, all your fruits will wither, and
all your knowledge will perish, and all your expectations and hopes will
perrish, to you this is the word of the Lord God, no pillowes under your
armeholes I sow, but to the light in your consciences I speak, which will let
you see your prayers and your praises, and all your imaginations of the Saints
words will wither, and is to be condemned, to be froth, in the nature of the
Sea, forming forth shame, I see come forth from you, with the eternal light
which comprehends the world, which light shall never change, with which light
all your ways and actions is to be condemned, which light will teach you how
to walk, if you love it, remember you are warned, in the time of your life,
and to you this is the word of the Lord.

The word of the Lord God to you, who are called Presbyterians, and to you who
read the common prayer, you are wholly in darkness given up to it, and so your
dark minds have the common prayer, and such would have a King to reign, for
there is that nature that would have an earthly King to reign, in which nature
lodges the murderer, dear dear is the love of God to all the world, in
sending his only begotten into the world, that whosoever do believe on him
should not perrish, but have everlasting life. Who does enlighten every one
that comes into the world, and if you did own the Son of God, you would own
the light which he has enlightened you withal, then you would own him to be
Lord and King, and this light would lead you our of darkness, and from all your
common prayers, and would teach you how to pray, and condemn all your set
form of prayers, and set times, and this light will teach you how to pray, if
you love it, there is your teacher, and if you hate it, there is your
condemnation, when you are in the pit and in the lake, to the light in your
consciences, I speak which Christ Jesus has enlightened you withal, which is
your condemnation that hates it, and when you are in the Lake, Pit, and ditch
remember you were warned in your life time, then all your common prayers, and
all your set ways, and all your customary teachings, and all your private
interpretations, and all your meanings of Scripture, your Presbyterian form,
Independent, and Annabaptist, Ranter and Leveller, who are in any forms
whatsoever, following your beggarly lusts of the world, with the light that
never changes, you are seen, with the light, who lives in your notions turned
from the light, and erred from the spirit and commands of God, all your
profession which has not the life, will stand you in no stead, no more then
the chief Priests, Scribes, and Pharisees, who was a separated people: and no
more then the Sadduces or any other which had not the life, when Christ came
woe was the end of their profession, who has a profession but has not the
life, with the light that comprehends the world, you are all seen which
comes from Christ, who is the same to day, yesterday, and forever, and changes
not, and to you all this is the word of the Lord God.
