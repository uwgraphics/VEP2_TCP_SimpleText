SOMETHING CONCERNING Silent Meetings.
COncerning Silent Meetings, the intent of all Speaking is to bring into the
Life, and to walk in, and to possess the same, and to live and enjoy it, and to
feel God's presence, and that is in the Silence, not in the wandering whirling
tempest part of Man or Woman; for there is the flock lying down at Noonday,
and feeding of the Bread of Life, and drinking at the Springs of Life when they
do not speak words; for words declaring is to bring people to it, and
confessing God's goodness and love, as they are moved by the Eternal God and
his Spirit, and so all the ravenous spirits that are from the witness of God in
themselves, cannot be still, cannot be silent, it is a burden to them; so
cannot keep at home in their own Houses, but are the Hunters before the Lord
like Nimrod the first builder of Babel; for God confounded them, for they went
out of the stillness and quietness, and like unto the Jews that went from the
Law of God, then they gadded abroad, and changed their ways, and so did not
see their salvation; then were they like unto the Apostate Christians, who
inwardly ravened from the Spirit, of God; so is gone from the silence, and
stilness, and from waiting upon God to have their strength renewed, and so are
dropped into Sects, and heaps among one another, and so has the words of Christ
and the Apostles, but inwardly ravened from the still life, in which is the
fellowship atteined to in the still life, in the Spirit of God, in the Power of
God which is the Gospel, in which is the fellowship when there is no words
spoken.

G. F.
