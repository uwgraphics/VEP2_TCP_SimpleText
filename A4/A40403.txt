An Epistle written from Lucifer, etc.
I Lucifer Prince of darkness, and profound heaviness, Emperor of the high
mysteries of the King of Acheron, Captain of the Dungeon Erebus, King of Hell,
and Comptroller of the Infernal fire;
To all our Children of pride and Companions of our Kingdom, and especially to
our Princes of the Church of this latter age and time (of which our Adversary
Jesus Christ, according to the Prophet says, I hate the Church or Congregation
of the wicked) send greeting, and wish prosperity to all that obey our
Commandments; as also to those that be obedient to the Laws of Satan already
enected, and that are diligent observers of our behests and precepts of our
decrees.
Know ye that in times past certain Vicars or Vicegerents of Christ, following
his steps in Miracles and Virtues, living and continuing in a beggarly life,
converted (in a manner) the whole World from the yoke of our tyranny, unto
their Doctrine and manner of life, to the great derision and contempt of our
prisonhouse and Kingdom, and also to the no little hurt and prejudice of our
jurisdiction and authority; nor fearing to hurt our fortified power, and to
offend the Majesty of our Estate. For then received we no tribute of the world,
neither did the miserable sort of common people rush at the gates of our deep
dungeon as they were wont to do, with continual pealing and rapping, but then
the easy, pleasant, and broad way which leads to death lay still without
great noise of trampling travailers; neither yet was trod with the feet of
miserable men: And when all our Courts were without suitors, Hell then began to
houle. And thus continuing in great heaviness and anguish, was robbed and
spoiled. Which thing considered, the impatient rage of our Stomach could no
longer suffer, neither the ougly wretchlesse negligence of our great Captain
general, could longer endure it; but we, seeking remedy for the time that
should come after, have provided us of a very trim shift: for instead of those
Apostles and other their adherents, which draw by the same line of theirs, as
well in manner as Doctrine, and are odious enemies unto us; we have caused you
to be their Successors, and put you into their places, which be Prelates of the
Church in these latter times, by our great might and subtlety, as Christ has
said of you, They have reigned, but not by me. Once we promised unto him all
the Kingdoms of the world, if he would fall down and worship us, but he would
not, saying, My Kingdom is not of this World: and went his way, when the
multitude would have made him King. But to you truly, which are fallen from
the State of Grace, and that serve us in the Earth, is that my promise
fulfilled, and all terrene things by our means which we have bestowed upon
you, are under government. For he has said of us (as ye know) The Prince of
this world comes, etc. and has made us to reign over all the children of
unbelief: therefore our adversaries before mentioned did patiently submit
themselves unto the Princes of the world, and did teach that men should do so,
saying, Be ye subject to every creature for Gods cause, whether it be to the
King as most chiefest. And again, Obey ye them that are made rulers over you,
etc. for so their Master commanded them, saying, The Kings of the heathen have
dominion over them, etc.

But I think it long till we have poured our poison upon the earth, and
therefore fill your selves full. And now be ye not only unlike those fathers,
but also contrary unto them in your life and conditions, and extol your selves
above all other men. Neither do ye give to God that which is Gods, nor yet to
Coesar that which is his, but exercise ye the power of both the swords,
according to our decrees, making your selves doers in worldly matters, fighting
in our quarrel, entangled with secular labors and business, and clime ye by
little and little from the miserable estate of poverty unto the highest feats
of all honors and the princely places of dignity by your devised practices,
and false deceitful wiles and subtilties; that is, by hypocrisy, flattery,
lying perjury, treasons, deceits, symony, and other greater wickedness then
which our infernal furies may devise: for after that you be by us advanced
thither where ye would be, yet that must not content you, nor suffize you, but
as greedy starulings more hungry then before, ye must suppress the poor,
scratch and rake together all that comes to hand, perverting and turning every
thing topsi-turvey; so swollen, that ready to burst for pride, living like
leachers in all corporal delicateness, and by fraud directing all your
doings, you challenge to your selves names of honor in the earth, calling your
selves Lords, holy, yea and most holy persons.

Thus either by violence ye raven, or else by ambition and subtilty ye pilfer
away, and wrongfully wrast, and by false title possess those goods which for
the sustentation of the poor members of Christ (whom from our first fall we
have hated) were bestowed and given, consuming them, as ye our selves list and
therewith ye cherish and maintain an innumerable sort of Whores, strumpets, and
Bauds, with whom ye ride pompously like mighty Princes; far otherwise going,
than those poor beggarly Priests of the Primitive Church. For I would ye
should build your selves rich and gorgeous palaces, fare like Princes, eating
and drinking the most daintiest meats and pleasantest wine that may be gotten,
and hoard and heap together an infinite deal of treasure, not like to him that
said, Gold and silver have I none: yea, ye serve and fight for us according to
your wages. O most exceptable society and fellowship promised unto us by the
Prophets, and of those Fathers long ago reproved. Whilst that Christ called
thee the Sinagogue of Satan and likened thee to the mighty Whore which
committed Fornication with the Kings of the Earth, the adulterous Spouse of
Christ; and of a chaste person made a Strumpet; Thou have left thy first love
and cleaved unto Us, O our beloved Babylon, oh our Citizens, which from the
transmigration of Jerusalem come hither: We love you for your deserts, We
rejoice over you, which contemn the Laws of Simon Peter, and embrace the
Laws of Simon Magus our friend, and have them at your fingers end, and
exercise the same publicly, buying and selling spiritual things in the Church
of God, and against the Commandment of God; ye give benefices and honors by
Petition, or else for money, for favor or else for filthy service: And refusing
to admit those, that be worthy, to Ecclesiastical dignities, and referring
those that be unworthy: you call into the inheritance of Gods Sanctuary, Bauds,
liars, flatterers, your Nephews and your own Children, and to a childish Boy,
ye give many Prebends, the least whereof ye deny to bestow on a poor good Man,
and receive gifts; ye regard money, and have no regard of Souls; ye have made
the House of God, a Den of Thieves. All abuse, all extortion is more exercised
an hundredth fold in your Judgement-Seats, then with any secular Tyrant. Ye make
Laws and keep not the same, and ye dispense with your dispensations as it
pleases you; ye justify the wicked for reward, and ye take away the just man's
desert from him. And briefly, ye perpetrate or commit all kind of mischief,
even as it is our will ye should: and ye take much pain for lucresse sake in
our service, especially to destroy the Christian Faith. For now the Lay people
are almost in doubt what they may believe, because if ye Preach any things, at
sometimes (althouh it be but seldom seen, and that negligently enough, even as
one would have it) yet notwithstanding they believe you not, because they see
manifestly that ye do clean contrary to that which ye say: whereupon the common
People doing as ye do which have the Government of them, and should be an
example of well doing; now many of them leaning to your Rules, do run headlong
into a Sea of vices. And so continually a very great multitude knocks at the
strong and well fenced gates of our dungeon. And doubtless ye send us so many
day by day of every sort and kind of People that we should not be able to
entertain them, but that our insatiable Chaos with her thousand ravening
jaws, is sufficient to devour an infinate number of Souls. And thus the
Sovereignty of our Empire by you has been reformed, and our intolerable loss
restored; wherefore we most specially commend you, and give you most hearty
thanks, exhorting all you, that in any wise ye persevere and continue, as
hitherto ye have done; neither that ye slack henceforth your enterprises. For
why, by your help we purpose to bring the whole World again, under our power
and dominion. Over and besides this, we commit unto you no small authority to
supply our places in the betraying of your Brethren; and we make and ordain
you our Vicars and the Ministers of Antichrist our Son now hard at hand, for
whom ye have made a very trim way and passage. Furthermore, we council you
which occupy the highest names of all other, that ye work subtly, and that
ye (faynedly) procure peace between the Princes of the World, and that ye
cherish and procure secret cause of discord: And like as craftily ye have
destroyed and subverted the Roman Empire; so suffer ye no Kingdom to be
overmuch enlarged, and enriched by tranquillity and peace least perhaps in so
great tranquillity (all desire of Peace set aside) they dispose themselves to
view, and consider your most wicked works, suppressing on every side your
estate, and from your treasures take away your substance, which we have caused
to be kept and reserved in your hands until the coming of our welbeloved Son
Antichrist.

We would ye should do our Commendations to our entirely beloved Daughters,
Pride, Deceit, Wrath, avarice, Belly-Cheere, and Leachery, and to all other my
Daughters, and especially to Lady Symony, which has made you men, and enriched
you, and has given you Sack with her own Breasts, and weaned you, and
therefore in no wise see that you degenerate from her. And be you lofty and
proud, because that the most high dignity of your estate does require such
magnificency: And also be ye covetous, for whatsoever ye get and gather into
your Fardell, it is for Saint Peter, for the peace of the Church, and for the
defense of your Patrimony and the Crucifix, and therefore ye may lawfully do
it; ye may promote your Cardinals to the highest seat of Dignity, without any
let in the World in stopping the mouth of our Adversary Jesus Christ; and
alleging again, that he preferred his kinsfolk (being but of the poor and
base degree) unto the Apostleship; but do not you so, but rather call, as ye
do, those that live in arrogance, in haughtiness of mind, and filthy
lechery, unto the state of wealthy, riches, and pride, and those rewards and
promotions which the followers of Christ forsook, do ye distribute unto your
friends: Therefore as ye shall have better understanding, prepare ye vices
cloked under the similitude of virtues. Allege for your selves the glosses of
the Holy Scripture, and wrest them directly, serve for your purpose. And if any
man preach or teach otherwise, then ye will; oppress ye them violently with
the sentence of excommunication, and by your censures heaped one upon another
by the consent of your brethren, let him be condemned as an Heretieke, and let
him be kept in close and straight Prison, and there tormented till he die, for
the terrible example to all such as confess Christ: And setting all favor
aside, cast him out of your Temple, least, peradventure, the engraffed Word may
save your souls, which Word, I abhor, as I do the souls of other faithful
men: And do your endeavors, that ye may deserve to have the place, which we
have prepared for you under the most wicked foundation of our dwelling place.
Fare ye well with such felicity, as we desire and intend finally to reward and
recompense you with.

Given at the Centure of the Earth, in that our dark place, where all the
rablement of Devils were present specially for this purpose, called unto our
most dolorous Consistory, under the Character of our terrible seal, for the
confirmation of the premises.
FINIS.
