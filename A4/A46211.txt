BY THE Lord Deputy AND COUNCIL:
ARRAN.

WHEREAS We are informed that the Price of Corn and all sorts of Grain, Meal,
and Malt is grown excessive high in several Parts of this Kingdom, which does
arise as is conceived from the great quantities of Corn which have been of late
carried out of this Kingdom, into Foreign Parts. We the Lord Deputy and
Council, for a timely and seasonable prevention of that Scarcity which by such
Transportation of Corn may be brought upon this Kingdom; Do hereby in his
Majesty's Name strictly Charge and Command all manner of persons whatsoever,
that they do from henceforth until Michaelmas next, forbear to Ship, Carry or
Transport, any Wheat, Barley, Rye, Bear, Oats, Pease, Pulse, Meslin or any
Meal or Malt out of this Kingdom, to any other Place whatsoever beyond the
Seas, as they will answer the contrary at their perilis. And We require all his
Majesty's Officers in the several and respective Ports of this Kingdom: And the
Commissioners for manageing of his Majesty's Revenue in this Kingdom, that they
do Seize all such Grain, Meal or Malt, as they shall find to be Shipped after
the Date of this our Proclamation, and before Michaelmas next, with intent to
Export the same, contrary to the meaning hereof.

Given at the Council Chamber in Dublin the fifth day of May, 1684 Mich. Armah.
