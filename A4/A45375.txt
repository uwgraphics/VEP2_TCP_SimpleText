A true COPY of a Paper delivered by the Duke of Hamilton to some of his
Servantes, at St James that morning before he suffered, in the presence of
Doctor Sibbald.
I Know you that are here, to be true, and faithful to me, I will therefore in
your hearing, say some what in order to my self, and to my present Condition,
and give you also this Copy of it, which after I am gone may perhaps be
thought necessary to be published as the last testimony of my loyalty to my
King, for whom I now dye, and of my affection to my Country, for the pursuance
of whose pious, and loyal Comands, I am now to suffer.

That my Religion has always bin, and still is Orthodoxe I am confident no
man doubts, I shall not therefore need to say much to that Particular, only
that I am of the true reformed Protestant Religion, as it is professed in the
Church of Scotland.

I do take God to witness, that I have bin constantly a loyal and faithful
subject, and servant to his late Majesty (in spite of all malice and
Calumny,) I have had the honor since my Childhood, to attend, and be near
him, till now of late, and during all that time I observed in him as eminent
virtues, and as little vice, as in any man I ever knew, And I dare say he never
harbored thought of Countenancing Popery in any of his Dominions, otherwise
then was allowed by the Laws of England, and that among all his Subjects,
there could not be found a better Protestant then him self, And surely also,
he was free from having any intent to exercise any tyranny, or absolute Power,
over his Subjects, and that he has been so unfortunate, I rather impute the
Cause of it to the sins of his people, then to his own.

For my own part, I do protest never to have swerued from that true
allegiance, which was due unto him, and that has Constantly bin paid (to my
Comfort I speak it) to his Progenitors, by my Ancestors for many ages
without spott, or dishonor, and I hope shall be still by my successors to his
posterity.

I do heartily wish well to, and pray for, his Royal Issue, and shall dye a
true, and loyal subject to his eldest son Charles the second the
unquestionable King by right, of all his Fathers Kingdoms, I hope (though I
do not live to see it) that Gods Justice and Goodness will in his own time
establish him on the throne of his Father, which I doubt not some of you will
see come to pass, and I am Confident that till then, and so long as men
deeply plunged in guilt, and self Interest usurp power, and government,
These Kingdoms will fall short either of Peace, or any other permanent
happiness.

I speak this from my just affection to the Royal Race, and much Compassion
to his Majesty's Subjects, but not from any Malice, anger, or desire of
Revenge, against any, for what I have, or am to suffer, for I forgive all men.

It is well known what Calumnies, and aspersions have been thrown upon me,
by men of several Parties, and Interests, not excepting those who would seem
to carry much affection to his late Majesty as though I had expressed
disseruice, or disloyalty unto him, the which how malicious and groundles they
were, I appeal to God, who with my own Conscience, clearly bears witness of
my innocence therein, And I shall beg mercy from him to whom I am now to give
an account of all my thoughts and actions, as I have still had a faithful, and
a loyal heart to my Master.

It has bin a general Complaint, that I persuaded his Majesty to pass the
Act for Contynuing this Parliament, I dispute not whether the doing of it at
that time, might have bin reputed good, or bad, but surely it was not I that
did persuade it.

Neither did I at all, deal with his Majesty for his Consent to the Bill of
attainder, for taking away the life of the Earl of Strafford whose great
parts, and affection, is known I highly valued, yet some have been pleased to
attribute to me the Cause of that concession, but were his Majesty now living,
I am confident he would publicly Clear me in both these, as he has bin
pleased many times in private formerly to do.

And truly I am not conscious to my self (though I have bin for many years a
privy Counselor to him) of ever giving him any advice that tended to other
End (as I conceived) then the good and Peace of his Majesty and his Dominions.

It has bin rumoured, since my last imprisonment, that I should confess my
self, to be the greatest Instrument under his Majesty (by making use of his
Scottish great Seal) for authorizing the war in Ireland, A report so false,
and simple, as in my opinion, judicious and honest men will not believe it, And
truly, as I am free from having hand therein, in any manner of way, so, I am of
nothing more confident, then that his Majesty was also absolutely free there
of, and that he was not in any Case, a Causer or Countenancer, of those Irish
troubles.

I have bin often examined touching Persons of several quallities within this
kingdom, that (as is supposed) did invite into England the late Army from
Scotland, or promised assistance after their Coming, and of late much
persuasion has bin used with me to that purpose, as that upon my discovery
thereof depended the only means of my preservation, I will not say that I had
any thing to reveal, which would have been satisfactorie, but this I desire
you to attest to the world, that I have not accused, or said any thing, that
may reflect on any man, of what degree soever within the Kings Dominions, And
indeed, it was so Contrary to my Conscience, and so derogatorie to my honor,
that if I had been able yet I should never have prejudiced any in that nature,
though it had been to save me a 100. lives.

Touching that foul, and senseless slander, that I betrayed the Army under my
Conduct, the care, and pains I then took to prevent the loss of it, and the
near approach of my suffering for it, will I suppose abundantly Contradict this
aspersion, I was satisfied with the justnes and necessity of that engagement,
upon the Growndes of the Declaration of the Parliament of Scotland, fearing
then, the sad confusions which has since followed here, both in Church, and
State, and particularly the fatal fall of my Master, to the preservation of
whose Person, I was by obligation, and a natural affection, as passionately
tied, as I could be by duty, and alleagiance.

And now I confess, I am void of all rancour, or displeasure against any,
though I am within few hours to dies adjudged by a lawless, and arbitrary
Court of purpose erected (as is said) to destroy my Master and some of his
servants, and for a great part composed of men Mechanic, and unfit to be
Judges, my death being decreed (right or wrong) as is reported before ever the
trial began, and though my death is no less then murder, yet I forgive all,
and pray to God to do it, and that my blood be not laid to their Charge, or
to some powerful, and eminent men's, who, as is thought upon some sinister
Ends, have many months since Contrived my destruction, which now is ready to
take effect.

And though I have answered to that Court, in regard of the justnes of my
defense, which I thought would have waighed with them, yet I never thought, nor
do I acknowledge any Jurisdiction, or lawful Authority in the same, not
withstanding, I do with all Christian humility submitt to the Punishment which
for my other personal sins, the Lord has justly brought upon me.

I should have spoken much more, yet would not have said so much, but for fear
lest either my memory might slipp it on the Scaffold, or that the rudenes of
some people by noise or otherwise, might have interrupted me speaking on this
subject, So I thank God, I am well prepared, God bless you, Remember me to
all my friends.

I know I have been a great sinner, yet through faith I have an assurance that
God will forgive me, and have mercy upon me through the alone suffering, and
intercession of Jesus Christ my Savior.

AMEN.
