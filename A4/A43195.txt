A HEALING MOTION From abroad to the PARLIAMENT OF THE Commonwealth OF
ENGLAND, SCOTLAND, AND IRELAND, etc.

An.o Dominj 16^^

The Letter sent to the Publisher of the following descourse
Sir,
YOur noted affection to serve the public and to do all good offices to
strangers, give me this freedom in an unknown habit to apply my self unto
you, to present you with the sense of Forrainers, well-willers to England, who
look hopefully upon the present Parliament.

You need not know who has sent it; it is not at all material, nor useful to
be known: Believe it as a great truth, that the thing expressed here is the
hearty desire of true Protestants abroad: and as such let it be made public.

You may own this way of receiving it; but are entreated earnestly to satisfy
no man's curiosity in telling any of your own conjectures whence it is sent, it
is enough that it comes from abroad, and that no living soul of the English
Nation, either in or out of England; was ever acquainted with the writing or
sending of it to you. And let this suffice to free it from suspicion of a
supposititious work: behold the Lord is a witness that I speak the Truth. This
Motion is wholly from abroad; from none in England, and was never thought on by
any there. As for matter of partiality, it will free it self to all that are
ingenuous; others ought not to be regarded: And if you think good you (...)

A Healing Motion.
From abroad to the Parliament of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and
Ireland, etc.
THere be Two Passions in the corrupt nature of man, which are most destructive
to all humane Societies: the one is from the Spirit of Envy, or evil
designing; the other is from the Spirit of Jealousy, or evil surmising: The
last can see nothing but evil in others, the first begets a hatred against
others for the good that is seen in them. They proceed both from the light of
self-love and pride, and begets in those that are led by them, all manner of
distance, division and contradiction as to matters of counsel, and all
confusion, strife and opposition as to matters of action: whereupon the ruin
of all States must needs follow; when in the Members thereof these passions
become so predominant, that men are not able to entertain any Christian or
civil inclinations to mutual confidence and charity, without which no common
Interest can be maintained. And although no humane passions in natural men are
so incurable as these, because they are most deeply rooted in the corruption of
nature; yet in two sorts of men, they may be rectified and subdued: namely in
such who are not altogether void of the life of true Christianity in respect of
God; and in such who making use of their Reason pretend to ingenuity and common
honesty in reference to men: We say in such men, who are upright in heart
toward God, in the kingdom of his Son, and toward mankind in the State
wherein they live, these Passions will not be prevalent, against the bonds of
spiritual and natural duties, which Christians and Countrymen owe to each
other.

Now because it is conceived that at this time, nothing can disturb in humane
appearance the welfare of England if these distempers arise not, between the
Members of this Parliament and the Governors of the State; therefore it is
come into the heart of some who live abroad, persons disingaged from all
particular relations to any party formed in the Nations, but well willers to
the whole Body thereof; to represent without prejudice in a Christian way of
love and solliciteousnesse, that which they conceive may prevent or cure in men
of ingenuity, and of a public spirit the forenamed distempers, if any (which
we hope not) should, by weakness or design, be set a working: lest unhappily at
such a juncture, the corruption which is natural to all men, turn any of their
generous hearts from the aim; and their feet from the way of their chief duty,
which is to be helpful to the State, and faithfully useful one to an other in
their station, that they may with heart and hand concur together, to advance
the glory of God in their Generation, and the welfare of the Nation which has
put its Interests into their hands: For these are the two main ends of their
calling unto the high employment, whereunto by God and man they are admitted;
because in the last of these the private safety and happiness of every one is
wraped up; and unto the first all other Interests are subordinate. And although
Forraigners can take no cognizance of the choice of persons to the places
whereunto they are called, yet because they are not a little concerned in their
performing or not performing of the duties, by which the forenamed ends of
their calling are attainable, chiefly at this seasonable time when the
Commonwealth is acting abroad, and deliberating at home: Therefore they may
lawfully and without offense endeavor to suggest what they know to be
conducible for the attainment of the main Aims forementioned; because such as
have a common concernment and may be loosers or gainers together, ought to
mind each other of the means and ways by which their Interest may be
advanced. Now it is out of all doubt that much of the temporal welfare of all
Foreign Protestants is involved in the good settlement, well-being and
prosperity of England, to carry on the common cause, which by a special
providence at this time it has embraced, to make amends for the former failing
in this kind, over which all Protestants had cause to complain and the honest
godly souls at home lamented.

It shall then be supposed in this Discourse not only that the Choice is
lawful, but also that the persons chosen are qualified with the endowments
requisite for their places, that is, with a true sense of Christianity, and
with the right use of humane reason in humane affairs. To such then this plain
motion is made by those who abroad wish well to England.

That seeing their hand is now at the plough, they would not look backward but
forward: That is, That they would settle their hearts to settle the State, in a
way of carrying on the common Interest of Gods People both within and without
the Nation; and that they would not entangle themselves in the disputes of
times past, and things past remedy, which can produce nothing but discontent
and distraction between themselves at home, with discredit and disadvantage to
the Nation abroad. And to open this matter a little further; even to the
meanest of all men's capacities, though never so much prepossessed with the
thoughts of partiality, we shall say that the main Interest of all Gods people
every where is twofold. First That in their days they may see the
manifestation of Gods glory, advanced amongst themselves to be derived to their
posterity. Secondly, That their own temporal well being may be settled in a
durable course, which in humane reason will not be subject to sudden
alterations. And to carry on those designs, as the care and faithfulness of
those that are entrusted with a Parliamentary Power ought in the fear of God to
be engaged, so to help foreward the performance of the work it self in our
days; let it be free for Foreigners to represent their thoughts concerning
the means, without which these designs cannot possibly and by which they may
infallibly be carried on to some perfection. And to this end, the nature of the
main thing aimed at, namely, the glory of our God being made known, the means
by which it may be advanced, and in order thereunto the way to settle the
Common welfare of the State will evidently appear.

The glory of God then is chiefly made known and manifest in the fruits of his
goodness to his people, where is to be discerned who Gods people are, and what
the fruits of his goodness are unto them. The People of God are they that know
his name in Christ, that own it and will be called by it; that worship him in
spirit and truth, according to his revealed Word and Will by Christ, and that
through Christ alone make him their refuge.

The fruits of his goodness to this his people are these.

1. That having revealed himself unto them, and called them effectually to
himself out of this evil world, they are set unchangably under the Banner of
his love in the new Covenant, and his Spirit, Word and Ordinances dwell with
them.

2. That by this Spirit, Word and Ordinances, they are enabled and directed to
serve him all the days of their life in righteousness and holiness, being
freed from the power and fear of all their enemies.

3. And that they have a sure hope to possess a Kingdom that can not be
shaken, when the things that are shaken shall be removed. As in the enjoyment
of these blessings Gods people is made happy; so in the appearance thereof upon
them his glory is made manifest unto the world: He then that will in his place
advance the manifestation of this glory, ought to further according to his
ability Gods people to stand under the enjoyment of these blessings.

Now if it be asked by what means and how can the manifestation of this Glory
be advanced by Men? To this it may be Answered, That no man can advance it
otherwise then by setting himself to become a receptacle thereof; and by
conveying in his place the evidence thereof unto others. From whence it will
follow, that if the Members of this Parliament, are men who have indeed set
themselves to be receptacles of these fruits of Gods goodness: if they know the
true advantage and how to make right use of their places for God; and if they
really will lay to heart how they ought to convey the manifestation of his
goodness to their own Nation, and the men of this Generation; then we may
infer that this Design will certainly prosper in their hand, and be carried on
by them in their present station: but if any void of these thoughts, be
inclined to envy and jealousy against his neighbors for private occasions, or
against those who have managed the public affairs of State, if he thinks of
quarrelling with them, and how to ravell into their matters odiously, making
use of his place to carry on some design against them: let him look to his own
heart in the fear of God, let him judge that a heart in that frame is no
receptacle of the goodness of God; and consequently is not upright toward the
main aim of a Parliamentary Station and calling: whence will follow, that he
who is possessed therewith and led therewith, can never approve himself in the
Trust committed unto him, either honest toward God and his people, or
faithful to the State.

Now if such a one (being conscious to himself that he is judged by these
words, which discover the error of his way) shall desire to make streighter
paths for his feet, least that which is lame in his poor and narrow soul be
turned out of the way; let him not slight the plain suggestions which here are
to be made, but seriously with a single Christian eye reflect First upon
himself, Secondly upon the people of God, and Thirdly upon the present state
of the Commonwealth of England.

Reflecting upon himself let him be jealous over his own soul; and seek to
discern the frame of that Spirit by which he was ledd, that he may know with
what Christian Inclinations toward God and men he stands in his place; for if
he cannot judge himself how shall he be able (as a parliament member ought) to
judge and rectify others? If he cannot take the beam out of his own eye, how
shall he take the mote out of his Neighbors? If then he is willing to go out
of himself, and to lay himself aside, that he may be capable to serve others
through love, if he shall be desirous to receive all to the glory of God as
Christ has received us; and in like manner to be received by all: If in this
way of receiving and being received, he has gotten his mind composed to
manage the public concernments of Christianity without murmuring and
disputing, without wrathful malice and strife; being enabled in meekness to
receive and to hold forth to all the light which he has received: If he has
been taught in bearing with dissenters to discern their principles, to make a
difference between those that keep the foundation and those that overturne it;
to deal patiently with all that they may recover themselves out of the snares
of the devil: and if he has studied the ways of Peace, of Truth, of
Righteousness, to be found not only blameless and harmless toward all men,
as he would have all men to be found toward himself; but also to hold forth
the word of life, and to shine as a light in that life before men. If (we say
reflecting upon himself) he discern without flattery, in his own spirit, this
frame wrought by grace, or a sincere desire and breaking forth of endeavors to
have it wrought: he may entertain hopes to become through mercy serviceable and
useful in his place for the advancement of Gods glory amongst his people. But
if to these thoughts and desires his spirit is an utter stranger, if with these
motions and endeavors, he has not at all been hitherto acquainted; let him
judge himself in the presence of the Lord before he be judged and condemned:
let him not play the hypocrite to meddle with holy things, and take the name of
our God in vain, whiles his heart is far from him: For the Lord will not hold
him guilty who takes his name in vain. Let him not presume above his line,
nor meddle with that whereunto he is not called nor set apart: for no man can
be a Vessel of Honor in the hand of the Lord, for the house of his glory to
serve therein, whom he has not endowed with these Principles and inclinations,
by which the way of true Christianity is held forth amongst the generation of
his children to the rest of the world.

Reflecting therefore in the second place upon the People of God, he ought to
discern the duty which by his place with his best abilities he owes unto them:
namely, that he is appointed to bear them as they are the vessels of the Lord;
even all the vessels of great and small quantity, from the Vessels of cups, to
all the vessels of flagons. The cups are the younger sort, the flagons the
elder: The Schools for the younger, and the Churches for the elder are to be
borne up; and the breaches of many generations therein to be repared; and that
is to be done by so much Public Authority as God has given to nursing
Fathers, and with so much care and influence, as becomes Elders and Leaders in
a way suitable to the Gospel, and to the day of Christ's power. He that cares not
for these Concernments of Gods people, to advance in his station the evidencing
of Gods goodness, unto the seed plots of the Nation, as well as to the plants
of full growth, but would have all engrossed to some one party with the
exclusion of others; cannot be said to serve the generation of his children,
and consequently is not found faithful to the public trust committed unto
him; for if he will be counted a Shepherd or leader of the flock, he ought
according to the nature, and in the capacity of his place, to carry the Lambs
in his bosom, and lead tenderly those that are with young; to oversee the
husbandry of men's souls, and to seek the peace and prosperity of Jerusalem;
that the beauty of holiness by the goodness of the Lord, may rest manifestly
upon his people, that all wicked doers may be cut off from the City of the
Lord, in that way which the Lord himself has appointed, and taught the Judges
of his people as at the first, and the Counselors as at the beginning. For the
way of the Lord is plain as well in the streets of natural reason, as in the
path of Christianity, and they that will see may see the means to be made use
of; and find a Directory for the application of the same without difficulty.

First, they will see that the word revealed in the Law and Testimony, ought
not to be concealed from Gods people: That the Ordinances ought to be
countenanced and upheld: that the faithful Teachers ought not to be removed
into a corner and thrust away from the faithful of the Land, either by
subtilty or violence: That the Office of the Ministry should not be made
contemptible, and become an object of strife and contradiction. That fit men
endowed with Ruling and Prophetical abilities, should be set a part to dwell
before the Lord, and attending the charge of his house without distraction,
they should be counted worthy of double honor, they should not want sufficient
food nor durable clothing, nor the respect due unto their faithfulness in
their places.

Secondly, they will see further that the liberty of the Saints should also be
maintained: That none should be suffered to assert or attempt to have dominion
over the faith of Gods children; nor to put a yoke or snare upon their
consciences: yet that this liberty should not be suffered on the other hand to
run out into licentiousness by the dissolution of all rule; or the neglect of
the orderly ways of mutual edification, under a pretense, that Christ is the
sole Lord and Ruler in and over the conscience, and that in the latter days
all shall be taught of God, for although Christ does by his power rule the
whole world, yet he rules his Saints within his Church, and has never exempted
their conscience from the rules of his word and Spirit, nor promised to teach
any without these as held forth in his Church; nor purchased a privilege to
any, not to stand under the direction of his revealed will in the Law and
Testimony given to his Church; nor limited the power of his vicegerents over
the society of men so, that it should be unlawful for them to see the rules
observed, which he has given to mankind, and to the assemblies of his Saints
(which they are commanded to protect) whereby the glory of his goodness unto
them is made manifest.

Thirdly, they will see also that not only in civil Administrations, but in
the Assemblies of the Saints God has appointed distinct callings: That these
are regulated by him, because he is the God of peace and good order, and not of
disorder and confusion: That the limits of these callings should be discerned
and observed, and that men who in humane affairs have no rule over their own
spirit, and yet take upon them to rule all Spiritual matters, only by the
unruly motions of their private fancies; should not be hearkened unto, but be
brought to know their bounds in speaking and acting, and consequently that
women should be made obedient to the Apostles Law, which is, that they should
keep silence in the Church, knowing that it is a shame for them to speak in the
congregation, 1 Cor. 14.34, 35. 1 Timothy 2.12
or to take upon them to teach and to usurp Authority over men.

Fourthly, they will furthermore see, that the Saints ought to be induced and
walk in love; to own one another in that whereunto they are come, to agree in
the clear rules of mutual edification and removing offenses, which dishonor
the Gospel: To bear one another burdens, and to make manifest their agreement
and brotherly union in the way of Truth and Peace, till God bringing them unto
a complete growth in Christ, and their moderation being made known to all men,
they may attain unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ, and
be no more carried up and down as Children with every wind of doctrine.

By the use of these means and the discreet setting of them a foot, the
reproach which has been cast upon England by their adversaries with much
industry and artifice, shall be taken off from the face of the people of God,
in the course of their visible observing of Ordinances; and the obloquie of the
ignorant, which by this occasion has been raised against all the Reformed
Churches abroad shall be silenced, and then the communion of Saints with
Foreign Churches may be set a foot and hopefully continued till the prayer of
Christ be fullfilled; Joh. 19.10, (...).
wherein he desired that all who shall believe in his name by the word of his
Apostles, may be one as the Father is in him, and he is in the Father, that
they also may be one in them, to the end that the world may believe, Joh. 3.16
that the Father has sent his only begotten Son into the world, that whosoever
believes in him, may not perish, but have life everlasting. For this is the
great testimony of the love of God and of his goodness toward his people; and
this is that which is to be made manifest unto the world, and whosoever in his
place of trust in England or else where, has no sincere aim to glorify God in
the manifestation of this truth, whereunto all the forenamed duties by the
Spirit and Word are made subordinate, in holding it forth unto the world by his
people; he cannot approve his conscience to be upright toward God for the
concernments of his Saints and the truth of Christianity, not faithful to the
Commonwealth whereof he is a member, because it is known that no Commonwealth
of this world shall henceforth subsist long or finally prosper, but in order to
the Kingdom of Jesus Christ; as grounded upon this, and upheld by this way of
settlement, Isa. 60.11, 12.

Therefore in the third place, if he will reflect upon the present state of the
Commonwealth of England, and does know that Christ by his kingdom does uphold
the pillars of the Earth, till he shall inherit all Nations; and that the
Commonwealths of the world have a being only till his Elect be gathered out of
them: and that in seeking the kingdom of God first and his righteousness, to
be settled in a Commonwealth, all other welfare will be added unto it: If these
Maxims are known and presupposed, then the temporal concernments of a State
may and ought to be laid to heart in the next place; and therein the duty of a
faithful Patriot and good Commonwealths man seriously considered: whereby
every one who is not void of all reason and honesty, will be taught in such a
juncture of time, to lay aside in his public place, all private interests and
grudges, and look to the present common concernment wherewith the Parliament is
entrusted in respect of men: Which we conceive is briefly this.

To preserve the safety and to continue the peace of the Nation at home.

To procure the prosperity, and to maintain the Credit thereof abroad.

Therefore his faithfulness will be to employ his abilities, industry, and
authority, to make use of the means and ways, which God and Nature has
fitted, and put in his hand, to further these purposes; of which means our
thoughts, we hope may be offered here; and as they are without partiality; so
they will be received without prejudice, by all that are intelligent.

To preserve then the safety, it is absolutely necessary, that some apparent
and allowed form of Government be settled therein: because the experience of
all ages agreeable to sound reason does show that nothing does ruin a people
so suddenly, and so absolutely as Anarchy, which is a state wherein no
Government being visible, it is free for every one to do by himself in
private, and toward others in public, whatsoever his own fantasy or his
unruly passion does suggest unto him: which needs must fall out when there is
no common Rule to walk by, nor any due respect had to any superior. Now how
far the Government settled in a great multitude of men (whose humors and
capacities, being by nature, education, and custom, many ways different, and
in some things opposite; yet have all alike an equal hand in the Government of
a Nation) does naturally tend to a perpetual unsettlement of all rule in a
Commonwealth, and consequently to an unlimited permission, for every leader of
a party to get power and thereby to oppose and disturb the way of such as
dissent from him, or for every member of a party to do for himself what ever
seems good in his own eyes (we say) how far a Government so constituted in
the hands of such a multitude, does naturally tend to a perpetual unsettlement
of all bonds of humane, spiritual, civil and natural societies, we shall not
set our selves to lay open; it may be seen daily abroad in all merely popular
Governments, nor will it be needful, nor is it expedient in this discourse for
proof hereof, to make any observation upon the changes lately fallen out in
England, by reason of such a way of Government; but it will suffice to take
notice, that no Foreigners ever could perceive any ground of safety or
settlement in that Commonwealth, till it happened that the Assembly which in the
year 1653 was called, and acted as a Parliament, perceiving its own
insufficiency (by reason of its divisions within it self) to settle matters in
a right frame; did resign the power of Governing into the hands of a few, over
whom a Head was set which has since given sufficient proof to the world, both
of his faithfulness to his Nation, and of his Abilities to Govern, with
Diligence, Courage, Foresight, and Moderation; and it is believed abroad, that
as long as he shall continue in the fear of God, and not be lifted up in his
heart, his course will not be interrupted; and as long as this course which by
him and his Counsel is taken shall continue without interruption, that the
State will be more and more settled in a flourishing condition, and not only
remain safe within it self, but become daily more and more formidable to all
that are enemies unto it.

Upon which consideration, as all Forraigners, who wish well to England (for
the Interest which in the Common Cause of Protestants, by this Man's conduct it
has begun to embrace) do stand amazed at the wonderful hand of God in raising
him, beyond all men's thoughts, and in keeping him against so many desperate
plots: so they hope that the faithful in the land, and the Patriots of the
Commonwealth in their supreme Assembly, will no less be sensible than
Forraigners are of this strange Providence; and in this their Meeting set their
hearts to concur with it and carry it on: not only by a confirmation of the
Authority (with the limitations already agreed upon) but by an addition of that
respect thereunto, which will make it more considerable, and unquestionably
receivable, (according to the Fundamental Statute laws of the Nation) by all as
well at home as abroad. For by such a settlement of the Government, the safty
of the State will be in all humane appearance henceforth secured from all
dangerous commotions and conspiracies, which otherwise will never be wanting so
long as the Pretenders to an absolute government, have power or can conspire
with the enemies of the State, to disturb the quiet thereof, and repossesse
themselves of their pretensions. Thus then the safety of the Nation may be
secured at this time from many dangerous plots; namely, by this addition of
Authority to the Government; and consequently by this means, the Peace thereof
at home, will also be continued and confirmed; because the quietness of a
State depends upon the Authority of the ruling Power, which cannot rest long
settled in the hands of a Multitude, chiefly when there is a necessity of
managing a War abroad, whereunto the united strength and Counsel of a Nation
must concur, to make it successful: And how far the government of strength
and Counsel can be managed by a multitude successefully to continue, is not
easily conceivable in notion, far less approved by experience. Solomon has
indeed said, That in the multitude of Counselors is safety, because a
multitude can suggest all manner of difficulties and dangers to be avoided, and
expedients to be followed, whereof the choice may be made by a few: but we
believe not that ever any wise man said, that the power of Governing in a
multitude was safe, or could be well settled: Therefore a multitude may be
heard in the way of consultation, but the result of the deliberation, and the
Power to govern, the execution must be entrusted to a few, chiefly when the
State is in a war abroad, and the peace thereof at home is doubtful.

But concerning the continuance of peace and quietness within doors, the chief
means thereof is not so much the settlement of the Governing power in a few,
as the unity of those who manage the public counsels in their aims of
administering Justice to all without partiality, and of permitting a due liberty
to all who refuse not to be Governed by laws, and are not turbulent nor under
the blame of any accusation, for Justice is the fountain, and liberty well
ordered, is like unto the Channel wherein Peace, and quietness follows in
the hearts and assemblies of men: the counsels then which we entertain
without partiality, to settle Justice with freedom to all, being unanimusly
persecuted by the foundation of Peace in a Nation. Now the great Council of a
great Nation convocated for extroardinary occasions cannot be constituted of a
few; and although in an Assembly of many Counselors, when men come together as
men, that is to speak their own sense, there must needs be a great variety of
opinions especially in circumstantial matters, concerning the manner how to
carry on a business; yet if their meaning be honest toward one and the same
aim, they will find a way jointly to concur to some conclusion in the main,
leaving the circumstantial manner of doing that which shall be judged fit to be
done, unto the prudence of those who are entrusted with the administration of
the Government.

And although all division of societies into parties, whereby some men join to
drive on some special design as distinct from others, does proceed originally
from selfwil and some predominant lust; yet parties are not formed in great or
small Assemblies, otherwise then by the breaking forth of strife and
contradiction, when in consultations about common concernments different
opinions are held forth and designs formed; or when in the same design
different ways are set a foot to proceed therein. This rock then is to be
avoided, for the Unity is commonly split thereupon: and to avoid it we
conceive, there are but two ways; the one relates to the Persons who are
employed to give Counsel, the other relates to the Manner of consulting which
may be set a foot. As to the Persons, they ought freely and conscionably
prepare and set their hearts to abjure all purposes and thoughts of framing or
following a party, for any particular design, by cleaving only to the common
aim of public safety, Peace, Prosperity and Credit of the Nation; for so far
as any does begin to break to the particular advantage of this or that party;
so much he deviates from the true aim of his calling to his public
employment: therefore in order to this resolution he ought in managing public
Counsels to avoid carefully all passionate disputes, personal touches and
contradictory debates: and proposing his own advice with the reasons thereof in
a serious, grave, single hearted way, as discharging his conscience in his
place, leave the judgment thereof unto others: but because all men chiefly
those that are quick and witty, have not such a restraint upon their own
spirits, when they perceive the weakness of others, as not to run out upon by
matters, and play upon them, which is to trifle (...) weighty matters;
therefore this in convenience which breeds division with open or secret
discontents can hardly be avoided when Counsels are managed by extemporary
discourses: Another course then may be set a foot in the way of consultation,
by which personal reflections will be avoided, and the occasions of
coffeehouse prevented, which we conceive is this. That the manner of
proposing advices should not be extemporary but premeditate, wherein the matter
to be advised on being foreknowen; every one should be obliged to propose his
sens positively in brief written. Aphorisms or Articles concerning the means
which he does judge most fit to be followed or avoided in prosecuting the thing
aimed at in the deliberation. And although in this way different means will be
offered nevertheless all advices being positive and directed more or less to
one main end; they will for the most part be found either coordinate or
subordinate one to another; then the means on all hands offered being laid
together by way of comparison, such as in substance agree most, and have least
difficulty, may be taken up and made use of by those who are entrusted with the
execution of the work.

Thus in the multitude of counsels will be safety, when all opinions are
heard, when the partiality of designs, the passion of debates, and the
trifling in proposals is avoided, and the real advices so far as an agreement
is found in them, are put together, to make up one determination, nor ought any
to be so self conceited of his own judgment, as to disallow the consent which
will be found in many, although his own opinion is not followed.

How far this way of consulting may be set a foot in a Parliament; we know
not, we leave it to the prudent consideration of those who without partiality
mind the public good rather then a private design. But it is known that
elsewhere in great counsels, this way is practiced, and that it is practicable
amongst ingenuous men is out of all doubt.

There is one difficulty more by which the minds of men are sometimes divided
and resolutions stopped, it relates to the Public Burdens whereof a
Commonwealth stands in need, chiefly in times of war; namely how to raise
sufficient contributions to maintain the necessary charges thereof. Here the
natural right and freedom of a people to dispose of their own substance, comes
in competition with the necessity of a State: Where then is to be considered;
how far every one is bound to suspend, or give up his private right in his
possessions toward the preservation of the Public welfare. Now we find
that in most Nations of Europe this freedom is utterly lost; the Subjects
being made slaves to the will of their Rulers, not only in war but in times
of peace: But in England the people by their Representatives in Parliament tax
themselves: Their wisdom and generosity being made acquainted with the
dangers whereinto the Nation is brought by the attempts of Adversaries, does
induce them, freely to part with some, to preserve all; and rather to give up
all to be managed for a lawful defense, then to loose all for want of courage
and resolution. In this case then a clear Demonstration of the Necessity
arising from without, when all Neighbors are in Arms; when no common ordinary
charges can secure the State, and when the providing for public safety can
suffer no delay, will sway the Resolutions of reasonable men to provide for
themselves and their posterity: and how far at this time the War with Spain,
and the uncertain friendship of other neighbors, may bring such a necessity
upon the state, we need not to mention; it is no doubt better known to those
that manage the public in England; and can be better insinuated to the
members of the Parliament then we are able to suggest. But herein certainly is
the faithfulness of a good Patriot seen toward his native Country, that he
will do his utmost endeavors to unite all honest hearts in Counsels and
affections, and all the strength that may be had at home, when iminent dangers
are abroad; not suffering private discontents to grow up to the disturbance of
the public at any time: but least of all then, when by their increase all may
be hazarded; or the success of necessary undertakings interrupted: which gives
us some cause to wonder at the Motion which is made in a little discourse,
called The Healing Question, propounded and resolved, etc. and said to be made
by a man of parts: Wherein we perceive a new design, as it were made in the
air, and which in substance is only this:

That a party which is said to have stood up for an Universal Liberty both in
their civil and religious courses, being now divided within themselves, by the
emergencies of the way wherein they were; should be united again, and endeavor
to meet in a military posture, to frame a new constitution of Government unto
themselves, and impose it upon the Nation; without any other principle or rule
of Righteousness presupposed or agreed upon amongst themselves, for future
safety and Peace; then their own growing light.

Which to us seems so wild and uncertain a foundation of Government, and of
consultation in State affairs, that it is to be admired any rational man should
ever imagine that any settlement can be procured thereby, either to a people
divided into parties, such as now are in great Britain, or to any one party
divided from it self, whiles each subdivision, according to its growing light
wrestles for the mastery with the other. For in the whole discourse there is no
common ground of unity offered, nor any rule or character of true light
suggested, whereby their aims should be fixed, or their Counsels and actions
directed to a public good; but the mere notion of a popular liberty which has
no bounds. If it be said that the principle and rule of self abasement and self
denial before God is proposed as the only means of their agreement, by which
God will appear amongst them. We Answer, that if this rule be truly followed,
men will indeed be kept from presuming above their line. But first, how can any
assurance be had, that a considerable part of three Nations coming all of them
voluntarily (that is accidentally) together, will truly intend to deny
themselves? Who shall discern this frame of spirit in them? Who shall separate
the vile from the precious, if false brethren privily come in to betray and
divide their thoughts? and if it is not imaginable, that either they all, or
the greatest part of them, will be such as deny themselves truly; or that those
who are truly such can bediscerned: then they are not like to agree, but a new
breach will fall out amongst them, and all will be again in confusion. But
secondly, supposing this to be possible, that men coming together to setle a
Sovereignty in themselves, and that in a military posture (as is supposed
should be done) can whiles they intend this, intend also at the same time to
deny themselves in the use of their Sovereignty and Power (we say) supposing
this to be possible, which seems nevertheless to imply a contradiction of
intentions; the question then will be; What can they by way of Counsel settle,
or put to execution in humane affairs? How shall they practice their self
denial? shall every one who pretends to a growing light, be obliged not to use
it? or in his soverraign capacity not intend to bring others under the rule of
it? for if he presumes to do this, how shall he be said to deny himself? and if
he does it not, where is the sovereignty, and how shall ever any thing be
settled in the way of Government? Thirdly, Suppose a general Council of honest
well meaning men come together as is suggested, who all walk by the principle
of their growing light; and have none other common rule but the aim of Liberty;
can it be supposed that they will all have the same measure of light in their
understanding, and latitude of liberty in their will? No certainly and if so
how shall they agree? Can it be conceived that every one will deny his own light
or his aim of liberty, to submit it to the will of an other? If so, why will
they not acquiesse in the will of those that govern? If not so, what
possibility will there be of any agreement, except there be some common rule by
which they may agree and be united in Counsels? Certainly it is not likely,
chiefly if what we hear be true; namely that it is found by experience that the
men who pretend to talk most of their light (they are called Quakers) are so
drunck with their own imaginations, that least of all men they deny themselves
in any thing. Nor indeed can they do it if their liberty be only this, to admit
of none other Rule in humane and divine affairs, but their own light
necessarily to follow it, as it does grow upon them: And what confusion this
will beget to unsettle all Humane Societies, and what division in
Consultations, we need not to mention: nay indeed with such there can be no use
of any consultation, where none is free to follow any reasoning with others,
and is bound up only to his own growing light which he counts infallible; and
which all rational men will count a kind of frenzy. Therefore from the
sugestion and by the principle offered in the Healing Question, there cannot
possibly any Healing be, or ground of safety and peace be laid unto a wavering
State. And truly the Question as it is there propounded and resolved, (if we
may speak our sense of it) tends only to the unsettlement of all that is now
established, and to cast down that which has been built upon former ruins,
by the more stayed and sounder part of the Nation; which hitherto has with
good success preserved the whole in peace and safety, by keeping the opposite
parties at home from oppressing each other; and Foraigners from invading and
destroying them all. Therefore we shall leave that notion of liberty, set forth
and clothed with good language, as a destructive Notion to all peace and safety
in the Nations, and fitted only to raise the spirit of a discontented party to
move toward some change or other; although it cannot know either where to rest
or what course it would shape to come to a setlement.

Thus having expressed our hearty wishes toward that which we conceive to be
the fundamental well-being of the State and Nation, we shall not need to
extend our thoughts much further to speak of the Superstructures of Prosperity
and Credit, how they may be built thereupon: For these will naturally spring up
as branches out of a fruitful tree well rooted and well planted. The State
being the Tree, the root thereof is the honesty of the heart of the Rulers
toward God and their Nation, for to advance his glory and their welfare. The
body or stem thereof, is the frame of Laws to settle the Government, in a way
of Justice to preserve peace and enjoy freedom well ordered. The main Branches
that grow up from hence are the Prosperity and Credit of a Nation; and although
these two branches take their growth commonly together, so that the one is
seldom without the other; yet in the Notions of their nature they are
distinguished; and the means whereby each of them is maintained and procured,
are neither immediately the same, nor so nearly linked together that they
cannot be separated; otherwise all the ways and means of outward prosperity
(suppose the Spanish massacring of poor Indians contrary to faith given) to
gain Riches and Power; would be counted honorable: But to speak briefly our
sense of the nature and means of these two, we offer it thus: That Prosperity
in our motion is nothing else but the flourishing condition of a people by the
increase of Riches and Strength; and that Credit or Reputation is nothing else
but the honorable esteem which others have of a people in respect of their
Virtues, namely Piety, Justice, Truth, Faithfulness, Constancy, Courage,
Wisdom and such like; whence it appears that although it falls out in the
world; that a rich and strong people are commonly in esteem with their
neighbors; and such as are in good esteem with all may grow in riches and
strength; yet the proper and direct ways and means of procuring true Credit
and Reputation are different from those which procure and uphold Riches and
Strength.

The proper means to procure Riches is Industry applied to Husbandry and
Trade; under the notion of Husbandry, we comprehend as well that Industry which
is above ground about the fruits of the earth; and all animate living
creatures, which move upon it; as that which is under ground, about Minerals
and Stones and such like. Under the notion of Trade we understand all industry
used to purchase, to prepare, to transport and to put off commodities by Land
or by Sea; to which we refer all manner of Manufactures, which beget all trade;
and the Art of Navigation which foments all Trade, and is fomented by the
industry of Fishing. All these Advantages England has to enrich it self
withal; as much if not more then any one nation whatsoever; if then Industry
to improve these advantages be not wanting; nothing can be wanting to make the
Nation flourish in wealth. Now to stir up industry in people not dull, but by
nature lively and active is no difficult matter, if their leaders be awake, and
lay to heart the way to settle them in a course thereof: which may be done by
observing the advantages, which by reason of sloth, or for want of skill being
neglected by their own, are laid hold of and improved by others. To this effect
should be searched into what the variety of native commodities most proper to
the Nation is; and what there is of common Commodities, which others have also,
what store there is of each sort* how much of each the Nation it self consumes;
how much want thereof is amongst Foraigner: how both sorts of commodities
should be improved by Manufactures; how most advantagiously brought abroad to
the utmost Market: how the trade should be regulated to be just and lasting:
how the commodities made most merchandable; the transport safe from Pyracy; how
the Sea Ports should be made not only commodious Harbors for Fleets; but
Magazins for the transportation of foreign commodities from one Nation to
another: Such like matters must be thought upon in the way of a State to make a
People industrious and prosper in wealth: and being wealthy there will be means
to put themselves in a posture of strength, when ever it is needful.

Yet although wealth helps much to further strength, nevertheless strength
consists not in it; but it consists chiefly in the ways of raising peoples
courage to be fit for action; in the uniting of their minds and resolutions to
stand for a common cause and interest; in the training up of youth to hardship,
and to the experience of action by Sea and by Land; and to the subjection unto
discipline; of all which things we have nothing to suggest but this only that
we conceive it belongs to the wisdom and faithfulness of those who are
entrusted to regulate the State of a Nation, to reflect upon these things for
the benefit thereof; and consequently to hear the advices of the most
experienced men in every kind either within or without the Nation, to put it in
a way of more industry then hitherto has been observed in it: and we wish that
the envy of Judah and Ephraim in point of Trade, may not only cease, but be
brought to a Coalition, upon common grounds and rules of profit and pains.

The last thing which we have in our wishes is, that the maintaining of the
Credit of the Nation may as well be understood as cared for, by those to whom
it is entrusted. It cannot be unknown to any who has been abroad, at what a
low rate the Nation has been valued at by all Neighbors before this last
change is befallen to it: wherein it has gotten a Protector to go before it: it
becomes us not to say what we know of this matter; and certainly in regard of
this it was in no small danger, both at home and abroad undervalued, because
Nations subsist and flourish no less by Credit and Reputation amongst their
Neighbors than by force; for the success of force is uncertain. But God was
pleased to give beyond all imagination, that success unto the Parliament
forces under the conduct of their Generals, which raised to a considerable
degree the Reputation of the Nations courage, which seemed to be lost.
Afterward the excess of their Courage and Resolution, begetting unexpected
changes, made the world stand in doubt of their wisdom. But now that which
was disesteemed is admired. The true Friends (which are none but true
Protestants) find cause to glorify God and look upon his hand with hope in
the Changes: The enemies (which are all Popish Agents and base Spirited
Politicians) are at a stand, and in a maze, not knowing where to find their way
concerning England. If from under such a low esteem of the wisdom of the
Nation, the credit thereof is thus far raised again by a Protector, what
might be done if it had a King of such an Heroic spirit, and able conduct? We
look upon the Nation therefore as raised from the dead, and set upon its feet
to act in its true interest, from which it was heretofore kept back. Formerly
the Spaniard had his snares upon all the Counsels, but these are now broken:
And we make no doubt but the Wise and Generous Representatives now assembled
will maintain the Credit of the Nation against him. The success of the war
hitherto has not been such as could bring gain: Seldom is it seen that the
beginning of a war is gainful, but we conceive it has not been undertaken
so much for gain, as for Justice and Reputation; and in this respect we find it
very succesfull; both in reference to the cause, and to the event, which may be
foreseen by those that are intelligent: The Protestant Cause in Europe is
sensible of it; and although in such a vast enterprise, the event cannot be
suddenly apparent to all; yet it may be perceived, that in a short time, being
continued, it will certainly ruin the great enemy of the peace of Europe; and
drain the fountain of his power, and break the Antichristian yoke which
hitherto for the Papal Interest he has put upon the conscience of all
Christians, who have dealt with him: We mean the Inquisition, by which he is an
open enemy to all Christian freedom. A Tyranny of the highest nature that can
be imagined; and under which all deserve to lie; whose spirit is so base as not
to join in opposing it; till the upholders of it be made as contemptible, as
ever they intended to be eminent by their affected Monarchy: And if there were
no more in the quarrel but this alone; The Reputation of England will be
glorious for ever in the minds of all men of Piety and Honor; for lifting up
a banner against it, when the rest of the world did fit still under it. We see
daily that some Nations make war with their Neighbors, for raising Taxes of
money, or infringing the liberty of their Trade; and should not all Christian
States become sensible of such abominable taxing of the persons and lives of
their Subjects; and of the infringment of the whole liberty of their Gospel
profession? it shall therefore henceforth truly be said that no Nation is
sensible of true liberty but England; and that all deserves to be slaves that
take not up this quarrel with it. And chiefly those who for the love of filthy
lucre, either strengthen the hands of Tyranny by assisting him in his
occasions of war; or withdraw their strength and the assistance due to those
yt do oppose him. Therefore we are confident that the pious and generous
Representatives of the highly esteemed Nation of England will not be wanting in
supplies or stick at extraordinary charges. Herein then what ever the event of
the war may be, will the Piety, the Justice and the Courage of the Nation be
renowned to all Christian posterity, that they alone have stood up, for the
freedom of conscience, not for themselves alone; but for all that make
profession of the truth, and this should raise the spirits of all honest men so
much the more, by how much it is apparent, that Christ has raised a man, as it
were out of nothing, beyond all men's expectation to take this work in hand:
Whence the success of the enterprise cannot be doubted of; seeing it is the
way of God to evidence miraculously his power, and to overthrow the mightiest
of the earth by that which has the least appearance, Blessed be his Name for
it; and let all that love him in truth say Amen.

There is one thing more wherein the Reputation of England is concerned, which
although it is not so apparent to the world as the former enterprise, yet in it
self it is no less considerable; and to the intelligent who have notice of it,
is a matter of no less rejoicing: We have heard of it, and conceive if it be
prosecuted (of which we doubt not) as it is hopefully begun, it will advance
the spiritual interest of Saints in one another, and the kingdom of Christ
thereby more effectually, then the breaking of the outward tirannical power of
the Adversary can do. It is the Design of taking away the divisions which are
amongst Protestants, and setting a Religious correspondency a foot amongst
them; for the propagating of the Truth wherein they are agreed. At this Design
as the godly on both sides are comforted and raised in Spirit to hope
cheerfully for a blessed enlargment of the knowledge of the Son of God; so the
Adversaries of the Truth are more then ordinarily startled and troubled at the
apprehension of the event: which is no small presage that the Lord is going
along with the design; and should be an encouragement to all intelligent Men to
join in the work; because that which the enemies of the Truth fear most; all
that have received the truth in the love thereof, should seek most to bring to
pass. This work of a Correspondency between England and Foraign Protestants,
for the interest of the Gospel, was one of the wise resolutions and proposalls,
which the Parliament in the year 1641. in their Remonstrance to the late King
made, as to be one of the effects of their Domestic Reformation then intended:
but the unfortunate Man followed a contrary course to the way proposed; and did
not only decline the Reformation; but corresponding with the enemies of the
Gospel opened a door unto them to bring in their Superstition into England and
Scotland, and to enlarge it in Ireland. But God has disappointed wonderfully
all those designs, as has been evident to all the world: therefore having
begun with them, when they were at the height of their undertaking to overthrow
it, we may assuredly conclude that he will also make a full end. For he has
declared his purpose that he will arise for his people to shake terribly the
earth; and what he has purposed, who shall disannull it? And when his hand is
streched out to execute his purpose, who shall turn it back? Therefore let all
that are upright in heart be strong to work with the Lord for the uniting of
his Saints, that their light may break forth as the noone day; and the glory of
the Lords goodness may be seen upon them. Let none look back as Lots wife did
to regret the loss of temporal conveniences; but all look forward to follow
the footsteps of the Almighty, who is gone forth of his place to show himself
on the head of his people united in his fear and love, to lead them unto rest;
and the honor of England is to march in the Front before all the rest whom the
Lord employs in this his enterprise.

These are the hearty expressions of our wishes from abroad, toward you most
Noble Senators, and toward the Nation whom you represent: that as by the good
hand of God upon the Spirit of your leaders you are become honorable among your
Friends, and terrible to your Enemies; so you would strengthen his hands in the
works, whereon the Lord has set him, and with him join your Counsel and
strength to help the Lord against the mighty: Remembering that it is not alone
by outward power, that deliverance will be wrought to the people of God, but by
the Spirit of the Lord: By the Spirit of love and unity amongst your selves; of
Righteousness and love toward all that err by ignorance, and are not made the
accursed thing: and of faithful confidence and hope toward God. If you
entertain the Motions of this spirit, and despise not the suggestions which
from a single heart we have offered as the testimony of our affections for your
welfare; We are sure the Lord will be with and will go before you, and the God
of Israel will be your rereward; and he will make you as a polished shaft in
his quiver to pierce through the very heart of his enemies; and that it may so
fall out, you shall have with the constant hearty prayers to Almighty God for
your prosperity, in due time also, the faithful hands of your humbly
affectionate friends abroad; who are known to the Lord whom you serve; and who
know you in him by his service.

FINIS.
