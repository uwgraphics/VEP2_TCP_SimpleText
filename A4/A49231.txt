THE French King's New Declaration: IMPORTING, That such of his Subjects as
have left France upon the Recalling the Edict of Nants, and shall serve in the
King of Denmark's Troops, or retire to Hamburgh, shall enjoy the Moiety of the
Revenues, arising from the Estates they have in his Majesty's Dominions.
By the KING.
HIS Majesty having been informed, that several Officers of his Troops, and
other his Subjects, who since the publishing of the Edict in the Month of
October, importing the Revocation of that of Nants, have departed the Realm,
and are withdrawn into England and Holland, as into Neutral Countries, are at
present in Perplexity, through the apprehension they have of being obliged, on
occasion of the present War, either to bear Arms against their true Sovereign,
or to lose the Maintenance they have in these Countries; And his Majesty being
willing to afford them the Means of not falling into such a Crime, which has
ever been had in abhorrence by the French Nation, and to avoid the other
Inconvenience, his Majesty has ordered, and does Order, Will, and Command,
that all those of his Subjects, of whatever Quality they be, that have departed
the Realm, on the Account of the Recalling of the said Edict of Nants, and
shall repair into Denmark, there to serve in his Danish Majesty's Troops, that
Prince being in Alliance with his Majesty, or shall retire to Hamburgh, may
enjoy the Moiety of the Estates they have in France, and in the Countries that
are in subjection to his Majesty, upon making appear every six Months, by a
Certificate in good and due form from his Majesty's Ambassador at the Court of
Denmark, or from the Resident for his Service at Hamburgh, that they will serve
in the Troops of his said Danish Majesty, or hold their actual Residence in the
said City of Hamburgh, which shall be returned unto them by the said
Ambassador and Resident; and upon such Certificates, which they shall cause to
be represented every six Months to the Intendants of the Provinces and
Generalities of the Realm and Countries in subjection to his Majesty, where
their Goods and Estates are situated, the seizure of the Moiety of the said
Goods shall be taken off by the said Intendants. His Majesty Orders and
Commands his Ambassador at the Court of Denmark, and his Resident at Hamburgh,
as also the Intendants of Justice, Polity, and Finances, in the Provinces and
Generalities of the Kingdom and Countries in subjection to him, to interpose
and assist each, as shall belong to him, to the observing and execution of
these Presents, which his Majesty will have Published and Affixed upon his
Frontiers and the Coasts of his Realm, and every where else, as occasion shall
require, that so his said Subjects may be informed hereof.
