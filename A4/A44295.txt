The honor of an Apprentice of LONDON.
Wherein is declared his matchless Manhood, and brave adventures done by him in
Turkey, and by what means he married the Kings daughter of that same Country.

The tune is, All you that are good fellows.


OF a worthy London Prentice
my purpose is to speak,
And tell his brave adventures
done for his Country sake,
Seek all the world abent
and you shall hardly find
A man in valor to exceed
a Printice gallant mind.
He was born in Cheshire,
the chief of men was he.
From thence brought up to London
a Prentice for to be,
A Merchant on the Bridge
did like his service so,
That for three years his Factor
to Turkey he should go.
And in that famous Country
one year he had not been,
Ere he by Tilt maintained
the honor of his Queen.
Elizabeth our Princess
he nobly there made known
To be the Phoenix of the world
and none but she alone.
In Armor richly gilded
well mounted on a Stead,
One score of Knights most hardy
one day he made to bleed,
And brought them all to ground,
who proudly durst deny
Elizabeth to be the Pearl
of Princely Majesty.
The King of that same Country
thereat began to frown,
And wil'd his Son there present
to pull this youngster down,
Who at his Fathers words
these boasting speeches said
Thou art a Traitor English boy,
and have the Traitor played.
I am no Boy nor Traitor
thy speeches I defy,
Which here will be revenged
upon thee by and by,
A London Prentice still
shall prove as good a man
As any of your Turkish Knights
do all the best you can.
The second Part,
to the same tune.
ANd there with all he gave him
a Box upon the ear,
Which broke his neck asunder,
as plainly does appear,
Now know proud Turk quoth he
I am no English boy,
That can with one small box o'th ear
the Prince of Turks destroy.
When as the King perceived,
his son so strangely slain,
His soul was sore afflicted
with more then mortal pain.
And in revenge thereof
he swore that he should dye
The cruelst death that ever man
beheld with mortal eye.
Two Lions were prepared
this Prentice to devour,
Near famisht up with hunger
ten days with a tower.
To make them far more fierce
and ea^er of their prey
To glut themselves with humane gore
upon that dreadful day
The appointed time of torment
at length grew near at hand,
Where all the noble Lodies
and Barons of the Land,
Attended on the King
to see this Prentice slain,
And buried in the hungry maws
of these fierce Lions twain.
Then in his shirt of Cambrick
with silk most richly wrought
This worthy London Prentice
was from the prison brought
And to the Lions given,
to stanch their hunger great
Which had not eat in ten days space
on one small bit of meat.
But God that knows all secrets
the matter so contrived,
That by this young man's valor
they were of life deprived.
For being faint for food,
they scarcely could withstand,
he noble force and fortitude
Tand courage of his hand.
For when the hungr^ (...)
had cast on him their eyes
The Elements did thunder
with Echo of their cries,
And running all amain
his body to devour
Into their throats he thrust his arm,
with all his might and power.
From thence by manly valor,
their hearts he tore in sunder,
And at the King he threw them
to all the peoples wonder.
This have I done quoth he
for lovely Englands sake.
And for my Country Maiden Queen
much more will undertake.
But when the King perceived
his wrathful Lions hearts,
Afflicted with great terror
his rigor soon reverts
And turned all his hate,
into remorce and love,
And said it was some Angel sure
sent down from God above,
No no I am no Angel
the courteous young man said
But born in famous England,
where Gods word worcester is obeyed,
Asisted by the heavens.
which did me thus befriend,
Or else thou had most cruelly
brought here my life to end,
The King in heart amazed,
lift up his hand to heaven,
And for his sold offenses
did crave to be forgiven,
Believing that no Land
like England might be seen,
Nor people better governed
by virtue of a Queen.
So taking up this young man
he pardoned him his life.
And gave his daughter to him
to be his wedded wife.
Where then they did remain
and live in quiet peace,
In spending forth their happy days
enjoy and loves increase.
