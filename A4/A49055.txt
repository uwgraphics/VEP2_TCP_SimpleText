FOrasmuch as it is conceived and apprehended by the Common Council, that the
City at the present is in great danger; These are therefore according to the
desire and direction of the said Court, to will and require you in His
Majesty's name, that presently upon sight hereof, you respectively, with the
Constables of your several Precincts, do repair to every Householder within
the same; and give them strict charge and command, that at their perils they do
so order and dispose of their Servants, and all others under their charge, that
they be not only kept from committing any Outrage or misdemeanor; But that
they and their servants from time to time be in a readiness, according to
their several Capacities, with Arms, Weapons, and Ammunitions for preservation
of the Peace, defense of themselves, the City, and the Magistrates thereof: And
also, that all persons who are of the Trained Bands of this City, do from time
to time upon the beat of the Drum repair with all speed to their Colors: And
therein demeasn themselves, as may conduce to the safety and welfare of this
City: And that you do from time to time certify unto me, or some other of his
Majesty's Justices of the Peace, the names of such Constables and others as you
shall find to be remiss or negligent in the performance of their respective
Duties in this behalf, to the intent that they may be punished according to
the law. And hereof fail you not, as you tender the safety of your selves and
the City, and will answer the contrary at your peril. This 25 of April, 1648.

To the Deputy, and Common-Councell-men, in the Ward of Michel.
