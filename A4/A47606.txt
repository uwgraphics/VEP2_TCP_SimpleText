THE ARTICLES OF THE FAITH OF THE. CHURCH of CHRIST, OR Congregation meeting at
Horsley-down, BENJAMIN KEACH, Pastor, As asserted this 10th of the 6th Month,
1697.

LONDON; Printed in the Year 1697.

To the Congregation with whom I am a Member (and the unworthy Overseer) who
are in God the Father, and in our Lord Jesus Christ; Grace Mercy and Peace be
multiplied.
Most Dear and Beloved in Christ:
I Hope I can say (with the holy Apostle) that you are by me dearly beloved, my
Joy, and my Crown; yea you are my Honor, and in you I would rejoice, being the
Ornament of my poor Ministry, by which the most of you have (through the
Blessing of God) been converted to Jesus Christ: and if you stand fast in the
Faith in one Spirit, striving together for the Faith of the Gospel, and do
adorn your Profession, living in Love, and endeavoring to keep the unity of
the Spirit in the bond of Peace, you will cause my latter days to be most sweet
and comfortable to me, after all those Troubles, Sorrows, and Reproaches I have
met with, both from within and from without. Evident it is God has most
eminently appeared to strengthen your hands: tho the Archers have sorely
grieved you, and shot at you, yet your Bow abides in strength; and that the
Arms of your Hands may still abide strong by the Arm of the mighty God of
Jacob, shall be my continual Prayers.

My Brethren, I here present you with that which you have so long waited for,
and desired me to endeavor to do, viz. to state an account of the most
concerning Articles of your Faith, which you have heard read, and have approved
of, and which I thought good no longer to delay the doing of. (1.) Not knowing
how soon I may put off this Tabernacle, and therefore would leave behind me an
account of that holy Doctrine and Order, in which through Grace you are
established (for at your desire also I have drawn up the whole Rules of your
holy Discipline, which you may have added unto this, and bound up together).
(2.) And the rather I have done this, because the General and more Large
Confession of the Faith of our Churches, is now out of Print; but that is not
all, for that being 12 d. price, some cannot well purchase it. (3.) And also
that all Men may see what our Faith is, and that we differ not from our
Brethren who bear other Names in any Fundamental Point or Article of Faith; and
that they may discern the difference between you and some that bear the same
Name with you. (4.) Tho you agree in the general with all other Churches of the
same Faith, in all those Articles there inserted, yet therein your whole Faith
is not comprehended, viz. that of Imposition of Hands upon baptized Believers
as such, and singing of God's Praise, etc. because some of our Churches dissent
from us therein: yet my desire is you would nevertheless show all Tenderness,
Charity and Moderation to such as differ from you in those Cases, and not
refuse Communion with them; and indeed your late sweet Temper appears to be
such, that I need not press you to this. All that I shall say more, is to
entreat you to labor after Holiness, and to awake out of sleep, that you may
adorn your sacred Profession, and prepare to meet the Lord; that as you have a
good Doctrine, you may also have a holy and good Conversation; and then we need
not fear who can harm us, whilst we are followers of that which is good, O let
us bear one with another. and if in any thing we differ, let us avoid all
Animosities. Brethren, great things are near, watch and pray, look out and be
ready. But at present I shall conclude with the words of the Apostle, Finally,
Brethren, farewell; be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one Mind, live in
peace, and the God of Love and Peace shall be with you.

So prays your unworthy Brother, Pastor, Overseer, and Servant, who earnestly
desires your Prayers also, From my House in Freemans-lane by Horsley-down,
Southwark. Aug. 16. 1697. B. Keach.

The Articles of Faith of the Church of Christ meeting at Horsley-Down.
Of God, and of the Holy Trinity.
I. WE do believe, declare and testify, Joh. 4. 24. Job 11. 7, 8, 9. Psalm. 90.
2. Jam. 1. 17. Exodus 3. 4. Rev. 4. 8. Deuteronomy. 6. 4. Exodus 34. 6, 7.
that there is but One Only Living and True God, who is a Spirit Infinite,
Eternal, Immense and Unchangeable in his Being, Wisdom, Power, Holiness,
Justice, Goodness, Truth and Faithfulness.

II. That there are three Persons in the Godhead, the Father, the Son, and Holy
Spirit; and that these Mat. 28. 19.
three are One God, the same in Essence, equal in Power and Glory. 1 John 5. 5.


Of the Decrees of God.
III. THat the Decrees of God are his Eternal Purpose Ephesians. 1. 4, 11.
according to the Counsel of his Will, whereby for his own Glory he has
foreordained whatsoever Romans 9. 22, 23.
comes to pass, even those Evils that his Wisdom and Justice permits for the
manifestation of the Glory of those his Attributes: And that God executes his
Decrees in the Works of Creation and Providence.

Of Creation.
IV. THat the Works of Creation are God's creating Genesis 1. Heb. 11. 3.
all things of nothing by his Word of Power, in six days, and all very good.
That God created Man Male and Female, after his own Genesis 1. 26, 27, 28. Col. 3.
10. Ephesians. 4. 24.
Image, in Knowledge, Righteousness, and Holiness, with Power and Dominion over
the Creatures.

Of God's Providence.
V. WE believe that God's Works of Providence are his most holy, wise, and
powerful preserving, and governing all his Creatures, and their Actions.

Of the holy Scriptures.
VI. WE believe the holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testament are the Word
of God, and are the only Rule of Faith, and Practice; all things being
contained therein that are necessary 2 Timothy 3. 16. Ephesians. 2. 20. Joh. 5. 39.
Deuteronomy. 17. 18. Rev. 1. 3. Acts 8. 30.
for us to know concerning God, and our Duty unto him, and also unto all Men.
That all Persons ought to read, hear, and understand the holy Scriptures. That
the Light of Nature, and Works of Providence, tho they declare plainly there is
a God, yet not so effectually as the holy Scriptures; nor can we know without
them Genesis 1. and 3. 15, 16.
how, and in what space of time God created all things. Neither came we any
other ways but by the holy Scriptures to the Knowledge Joh. 20. 30, 31. and 21.
24.
of Christ the blessed Mediator; which indeed none can savingly know but by the
Word and Spirit of God.

Of Original Sin.
VII. WE do believe, that God Genesis 3. (...), 6. Eccl. 7. 29. Romans 3. 23. 1 John
3. 4. Tit. 1. 13. Romans 5. 17. Genesis 6. 5. Jer. 17. 9. Romans 3. 10, 11, 12, 13,
14, etc. Jam. 1. 14. 1 Cor. 15. 14. Romans 5. 6. Romans 8. 7. Col. 1. 22. Mat. 15.
19. Romans 7. 7, 14, 17, 18, 23, 24. Lam. 3. 39. Romans 6. 23. Gal. 3. 10.
having created Man, he entered into a Covenant of Life with him, upon the
condition of perfect Obedience; making the first Adam a common Head to all his
Seed: and that our first Parents being left to the freedom of their own Will,
fell from the Estate wherein they were created, by eating of the forbidden
Fruit: and that Adam being set up as a public Person, we all sinned in him,
and fell with him into a state of Sin, of Wrath and Misery; the Sinfulness of
which state consists in the guilt of Adam's first Sin, the want of Original
Righteousness, and the Corruption of our whole Nature: from whence all actual
Sins proceed, as Water out of a filthy and an unclean Fountain. So that not
only by Imputation all Men became Sinners in the first Adam, but also as the
same corrupt Nature is conveyed to all his Job 11. 12. and 15. 14. and 25. 4.
Posterity, who descend from him in ordinary Generation.

By this Sin all Mankind lost the Image of God, and Communion Col. 3. 10. Tit.
1. 13. Psalm. 51. 5.
with him, being liable to all the Miseries of this Life, and to Death it self;
and also are dead in Sins and Trespasses, and obnoxious to the Wrath of God,
and the eternal Pains of Hell for ever. Hence we say that all are conceived and
born Ephesians. 2. 2, 3.
in Sin, and are the Children of Wrath, even the Elect as well as others, being
wholly defiled in all the Faculties and Parts of Soul and Body, and utterly
indisposed Genesis 6. 3. Romans 7. 5, 14, 15, 16, 17, 23, 24.
and disabled to do any thing that is spiritually good, and wholly inclined
with a strong propensity to all things that are evil.

Of Man's Free Will.
VIII. WE believe Man in his state of Innocence had freedom of Will to do good;
but by the Fall he has utterly lost all that Power and Ability, being Ephesians.
2. 2, 3.
woefully depraved in all the Faculties of his Soul; there being in the Will and
Mind of all naturally much Enmity against God, and a Romans 8. 7.
total aversion to him, and to every thing that is spiritually good; Job 24. 13.
loving Darkness, and rebelling against the Light.

But when a Man is renewed by Ephesians. 4. 28.
Divine Grace, tho there is no force put upon the Will, yet it is made Col. 1.
21. Psalm. 110. 3. Romans 7. 11, 17, 18, 23, 24.
willing, and acts freely, in the day of God's Power: tho the Work is not
perfect in any Faculty in the Regenerate, nor will be in this Life.

Of Christ the Mediator.
IX. WE believe that God having, out of his own mere good Pleasure, and
infinite* Ephesians. 1. 4. Romans 3. 20, 21, 22. Gal. 3. 21, 22. 1 Timothy 2. 5, 6. Joh.
1. 14. Galat. 4. 4.
Love, elected some Persons of the lost Seed of the first Adam unto everlasting
Life, from all Eternity, did enter into a Covenant of Grace with the second
Person of the Trinity, (who was set up as the common Head of all the Elect) to
deliver them out of the Romans 9. 5. Luke 1. 35. Col. 2. 9. Heb. 7. 24, 25.
state of Sin and Misery, and to bring them into a state of Salvation and
eternal Happiness.

That the second Person in the Godhead, (being the eternal Son Phil. 2. 6.
Zech. 6. 13.
of God, Coessential, and Coequal with the Father) according to that holy
Covenant and Compact that was between them both, became Man, or assumed our
Nature, and Joh. 1. 14. 1 Timothy 2. 5. Heb. 2. 14.
so was, and continues to be God and Man in two distinct Natures, in one
Person for ever. And that he the Son of God by his becoming Mat. 2. 26, 38.
Luke 1. 27, 31, 34, 35. Gal. (...) Heb. 4. (...)
Man, did take unto him a True Body, and Reasonable Soul, being conceived by
the holy Spirit in the Womb of the Virgin, and was born of her, yet without Sin.

Of the Offices of Christ.
X. WE believe that the Lord Jesus Christ, who is our Redeemer, and the one
blessed Mediator between God and Man, executes 1 Timothy 2. 5.
a threefold Office, both the Office of a Priest, the Office of a King, and the
Office of a Prophet.

First, That he executes the Office of a Priest, (1.) In his Heb. 2. 17. Heb.
7. 24. Act. 15. 14, 15, 16.
once offering up himself a Sacrifice, to satisfy Divine Justice, and to
reconcile God to us, and us to God. (2.) And in making continual Intercession
for us, that the 1 John 2. 2. Heb. 7. 25. and 10. 21. and 9. 24.
Merits of his Blood may be made effectual unto us.

Secondly, That he executes the Office of a King in subduing us Isa. 33. 22.
and 32. 1, 2. 1 Cor. 15. 25. Psalm. 100.
unto himself, and in giving us Laws and holy Precepts, by which we ought to
walk; and also in his restraining and conquering all his, and our Enemies.

Thirdly, That he executes the Office of a Prophet, in revealing Acts 3. 22.
Job. 1. 18. 1 Pet. 1. 10, 11, 12, Joh. 15. 15. and 20. 31.
to us by his Word and Spirit, the whole Will of God concerning all things that
appertain to Faith and Practice.

Of Christ's Humiliation and Exaltation.
XI. WE believe that Christ's Humiliation consisted Gal. 4. 4. Heb. 12. 23.
Isa. 53. 2, 3. Luke 22. 44
in that great Condescension of his in assuming our Nature, and being born in a
low condition, made under Mat. 27* 46 Phil. 2. 8. 1 Cor. 15. 4. Acts 2. 24, 25,
26, 27, 31.
the Law, undergoing the many Miseries of this Life, the Wrath of God, the
Curse of the Law, and the ignominious Death of the Cross, continuing under
Death for a time.

And that his Exaltation consists in his rising again from the 1 Cor. 1^. 4.
Mark 16. 19. Ephesians. 1. 20. Acts 1. 11. and 17. 31* 1 Pet. 3. 22.
dead the third day, and in his ascending up into Heaven, in sitting at the
Right Hand of *God; Angels, Powers, and Principalities being made subject unto
him; and in his being made Judge of the quick and dead.

Of effectual Calling.
XII. WE do believe that we are made Partakers Joh. 1. 11. Tit. 3. 5, 6. Ephesians.
1. 13, 14. 1 Cor. 1. 9. Ephesians. 2. 8.
of the Redemption purchased by Christ, by the effectual Application of his
Merits, etc. unto us by the Holy Spirit, thereby uniting us to Christ in
effectual Calling: And that effectual Calling is the Work of God's Free Grace,
who by his Spirit works Faith in Ephesians. 3. 17.
us, who are altogether passive therein; and convincing us of Sin 1 Cor. 1. 9.
2 Timothy 1. 9. 2 Thessalonians. 2. 13, 14. Acts 2. 37. and 20. 18. Ezekiel. 36. 27. John 6.
44, 45.
and Misery, enlightening our Minds in the Knowledge of Christ, and renewing our
Wills, and changing our whole Hearts, he does persuade and enable us to embrace
Jesus Christ freely, as he is offered in the Gospel.

Of Justification.
XIII. WE do believe Justification is a free Act of God's Grace, through that
Redemption Romans 3. 23, 24, 25, 26.
which is in Christ, (who, as our Head, was acquitted, justified, and
discharged, and we in Ephesians. 1. 6, 7. Tit. 3. 7.
him, when he rose from the Dead) and when applied to us, we in our own Persons
are actually justified, Romans 5. 15, 16, 17, 18. 1 Cor. 1. 30 2 Cor. 5. 21
in being made and pronounced righteous, through the Righteousness of Christ
imputed to us; and all our Sins, past, present, and to come, for ever pardoned;
which is received by Faith alone. And that our Sanctification, nor Faith it
self, is any part of our Justification before God; it not being either the
Habit, or Act of Believing, or any Act of Evangelical Obedience imputed to us,
but Christ, and his active and passive Obedience Act. 13. 39.
only, apprehended by Faith: and that Faith in no sense tends to make Christ's
Merits more satisfactory unto God; but that he was as fully reconciled and
satisfied for his Elect in Christ by his Death 2 Cor. 5. 21.
before Faith as after; otherwise it would render God only reconcilable, Phil.
3. 7, 8, 9.
(not reconciled) and make Faith part of the Payment or Satisfaction unto God,
and so lessen Romans 10. 5.
the Merits of Christ, as if they were defective or insufficient. Yet we say,
it is by Faith that we receive the Atonement, or by which means (as an
Instrument) we come to apprehend and receive him, and to have personal Interest
in him, and to have our free Justification evidenced to our own Consciences.

Of Adoption.
XIV. WE believe Adoption is an Act of God's Free 1 John 3. 1.
Grace, whereby such who were the Children of Wrath by Nature, are received
into the Number, and John 1. 10. Romans 8. 14. Gal. 2. 16. 1 John 3. 1, 2. and 4.
7. and 5. 1.
have Right to all the Privileges of the Sons of God; and that such who are
adopted, are also by the Spirit regenerated, and hence said to be born of God.

Of Sanctification.
XV. THAT Sanctification is the 2 Thessalonians. 2. 13. Ephesians. 4. 13. Romans 6. 5, (...).
7. Romans 8. 29, 30. Romans 5. 1, 2, 5. and 14. 17. Prove. 4 18. 1 John 51. 3. 1
Pet. 1. (...).
Work of God's Free Grace also, whereby we are renewed in the whole Man after
the Image of God, and are enabled more and more to die unto Sin, and live unto
Righteousness. And that the Benefits we receive, and which flow from or
accompany Justification, are Adoption, Sanctification, Peace of Conscience,
Manifestations of God's Love, Joy in the Holy Ghost, an Increase of Grace, an
Assurance of eternal Life, and final Perseverance unto the end.

Of the Souls of Men at Death.
XVI. WE believe, that at 1 Cor. 15. 43. Mat. 25. 23 Mat. 10. 32 1 John 3. 2. 1
Cor. 13. 12. 1 Thessalonians. 4. 17, 18. 2 Cor. 5. 1, 2 Phil. 1. 21. 22.
Death the Souls of Believers are made perfect in Holiness, and do immediately
pass into Glory; and their Bodies dying in Union with Christ, or dying in the
Lord, do rest in their Graves till the Resurrection, when they shall be raised
up in Glory. And that their Souls being reunited to their Bodies, they shall be
openly acknowledged, and acquitted, and made completely blessed, both in Soul
and Body, and shall have the full Enjoyment of God to all Eternity. And that
the Souls of the Luk 16* 5 1 Pet. 3. 19, 20.
Wicked at their Death are cast into Hell, or are in Torment: and that their
Bodies lie in the Grave under Wrath, and shall by virtue of the Power of Christ
be raised from Luke 16. 23, 24. Acts 1. 25. 1 Pet. 3. 19 Ps. 49. 11. John 9.
28, 29. 2 Thessalonians. 1. 8, 9.
the Dead; and their Souls being reunited to their Bodies, shall be judged and
condemned, and cast into a Furnace of Fire, or into unspeakable Torment, with
the Devil and his Angels, for ever and ever.

Of the Law.
XVII. WE believe God requires Obedience of Man, and that the Rule of that
Obedience is the moral Law as it is in the Hands of Christ; which Mich. 6. 8. 1 Samuel 15. 22. Rev. 2. 14. Mat. 19. 17 Mat. 22. 37, 38, 39, 40.
teaches all Persons their Duty to God, and to Man; the Sum of all being this,
to love the Lord our God with all our Hearts, with all our Souls, and with all
our Strength, and our Neighbors as our selves. And that tho the Law is
abolished as a Covenant of Works, and as so considered, we are dead to it, and
that dead to us; 1 John 3. 4. Romans 7. 3, 4
yet it remains as a Rule of Life and Righteousness for ever.

XVIII. We believe no mere Genesis 6. 5. Romans 3. 9, 10, 11, 12, etc. Ezekiel. 8. 6. 1 John 5. 16 Ps 78. 17, 32, 56.
Man, since the Fall, is able in this Life perfectly to keep the Holy Law of
God; and that every Offense against the Law deserves eternal Death, tho some
Sins are more heinous in God's Sight than others.

And that God, as a simple Act of Mercy, will not, does not, pardon any Man;
neither does it seem consistent with his Holiness Exodus 34. 6*
and Justice so to do, without a full Satisfaction: wherefore he substituted
Romans 3. 25, 26.
Christ in our room and stead, perfectly to keep the whole Law, and to die, or
bear that Gal. 4. 4.
Wrath which we deserved for our breaking of it; he being pleased Isa. 53. 4,
5, 6, 10, 11. 1 Pet. 2. 24.
in his infinite Love and Grace to transfer our Sins, Guilt and Punishment,
upon his own Son, (who took our Nature upon him, as our blessed Head and
Representative) that his active Obedience and Righteousness might be our just
Title unto eternal Life; and his Death (who bore our Hell Torments) be our full
Discharge from the Wrath of God, and eternal Romans 8. 1.
Condemnation.

And that all who would receive John 5. 24. John 3. 15. 16.
this Title, and have this Discharge so as to escape God's Wrath, and the Curse
of the Law, must fly to Heb. 6. 18, 19, 20. Col. 2. 12. Acts 15, 9.
Christ, and lay hold on him by Faith; which Faith is known by its Fruits,
having lively, Sin-killing, Soul-humbling, Self-abasing, Acts 2. 36. Job 42. 5.
1 Pet. 2. 7. John 3. 3.
Christ-exalting, and Heart-purifying Operations, always attending it.

Of Faith and Repentance.
XIX. WE believe that Faith is a saving Grace, or John 1. 12. Isa. 26. 3, 4.
Phil. 3. 9. Ephesians. 2. 8.
the most precious Gift of God; and that it is an Instrument whereby we
receive, take hold of, and wholly rest upon Jesus Christ, as offered to us in
the Gospel. That Repentance unto Life is also a saving Acts 2. 37. Joel 2. 12.
Jer. 3. 22. and 31. 18, 19. Ezekiel. 36. 31. 2 Cor. 7. 10 Isa. 1. 16, 17 Heb. 6.
1, 2.
Grace, whereby a Sinner, out of a true Sense of Sin, and Apprehension of God's
Mercy in Christ, does with Grief and Hatred of his Sins, turn from them. And
that tho Repentance is in order of Nature called the first Principle of the
Doctrine of Christ, yet we believe no Man can savingly repent, unless he
believes in Jesus Zec. 12. 10.
Christ, and apprehends the Free Pardon and Forgiveness of all his Sins through
the Blood of the everlasting Covenant, and the Sight and Sense of God's Love in
a bleeding Savior; being that only thing that melts and breaks the Acts 2. 36.
stony Heart of a poor Sinner, as the Sight of a free Pardon from a Prince
humbles the stout Heart of a rebellious Malefactor.

Of the Means of Grace.
XX. WE believe that the outward and more ordinary Mat. 28. 19, 20. Acts 2. 42,
46, 47. Neh. 8. 8. 1 Cor. 14. 24, 25.
means, whereby Christ communicates to us the Benefits of Redemption, are his
Holy Ordinances, as Prayer, the Word of God, and Preaching, with Baptism, and
the Lord's Supper, etc. and yet notwithstanding it is the Spirit of God that
makes Prayer, Acts 26. 32 Psalm. 19. 8. Romans 1. 15, 16.
Reading, etc. and specially the Preaching of the Word, effectual to the
convincing, converting, building up, and comforting, through Faith, all the
Elect of God unto Salvation.

And that it is the Duty of all, Acts 20. 32 Romans 10. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. Prove.
8. 34.
that the Word may become effectual to their Salvation, to attend upon it with
all Diligence, Preparation, and Prayer, that they may receive it with Faith and
Love, and 1 Pet. 2. 1, 2. Ps. 119. 18 Heb. 4. 2. 2 Thessalonians. 2. 10. Jam. 1. 25.
lay it up in their Hearts, and practice it in their Lives.

Of Baptism.
XXI. WE believe that Baptism is a Holy Ordinance of Christ, or a pure
Gospel-Institution; 1 Pet. 3. 21 1 Cor. 12. 13. Mat. 28. 19, 20. Romans 6. 3, 4,
5. Col. 2. 12, 13. Gal. 3. 27. Acts 2. 38. and 22. 16.
and to be unto the Party baptized, a sign of his Fellowship with Christ in his
Death, Burial, and Resurrection, and of his being grafted into him, and of
Remission of Sins, and of his giving himself up to God, through Jesus Christ,
to walk in Newness of Life.

We also believe that Baptism ought not to be administered to any but to those
who actually profess Repentance toward God, and Acts 8. 37. Col. 2. 21, 22.
Faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.

That the Infants of Believers ought not to be baptized, because there is
neither Precept, or Example, or any certain Consequence in the Holy Scripture
for any such Rev. 22. 18 Prove. 30. 6.
Practice: And we ought not to be wise above what is written. And that a human
Tradition or Custom ought not to be regarded, but that it is sinful, and
abominable.

We believe also that Baptism is only rightly administered by Immersion, or
dipping the whole Body in Water, into the Name of the Mat. 28. 19, 20. Mat. 3.
16. Joh. 3. 23. Acts 8. 38. Romans 6. 3. Col. 2. 13.
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit; according to Christ's
Institution, and the Practice of the Apostles; and not by sprinkling, or
pouring of Water, or dipping some part of the Body in Water, after the
Tradition of Men.

And that it is the indispensible Duty of such who are baptized, to give up
themselves to some particular Acts 2. 41, 42. and 5. 13, 14. 1 Pet. 2. 5. Luke
1. 6.
orderly Church of Jesus Christ, and to walk in all the Commandments and
Ordinances of the Lord blameless: Baptism being an initiating Ordinance.

Of a true Church.
XXII. WE believe a true Church of Christ is not National, nor Parochial, but
does consist of a number of Acts 2. 40, 41, 42.
godly Persons, who upon the Profession of their Faith and Repentance have been
baptized, and in a solemn manner have in a Holy Covenant given themselves up to
the Lord, and to one another, to live in Love, and to endeavor to keep the
Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace: Among whom the Ephesians. 4. 3.
Word of God is duly and truly preached; and Holy Baptism, the Acts 2. 40, 41,
42, 43, 44, 45, 46, etc. 1 Cor. 16. 1, 2.
Lord's Supper, and all other Ordinances are duly administered, according to the
Word of God, and the Institution of Christ in the Primitive Church: watching
over one another, and communicating to each other's Necessities, as becomes
Saints; living Holy Lives, as becomes their sacred Profession; and not to
forsake the assembling themselves, as the manner of some Heb. 10. 25.
is; or to take leave to hear where they please in other Places when the Church
is assembled, but to worship God, and feed in that Pasture, or with that
Church, with whom they have covenanted, and given up themselves as particular
Members thereof.

Of Laying on of Hands.
XXIII. WE believe that laying Heb. 5. 12. and 6. 1, 2. Acts 8. and 19. 6.
on of Hands (with Prayer) upon baptized Believers, as such, is an Ordinance of
Christ, and ought to be submitted unto by all such Persons that are admitted to
partake of the Lord's Supper; and that the end of this Ordinance is not for the
extraordinary Gifts of the Spirit, but for a farther Reception Ephesians. 1. 13, 14.
of the Holy Spirit of Promise, or for the Addition of the Graces of the
Spirit, and the Influences thereof; to confirm, strengthen, and comfort them in
Christ Jesus; it being ratified and Acts 8. and 19. (...)
established by the extraordinary Gifts of the Spirit in the Primitive Times,
to abide in the Church, as meeting together on the first Day of the Week was,
Act. 2. 1. that being the Day of Worship, or Christian Sabbath, under the
Gospel; and as Preaching the Word was, Acts 10. 44. and as Baptism was, Mat. 3.
16. and Prayer was, Acts 4. 31. and singing Psalms, etc. was, Acts 16. 25, 26.
so this of laying on of Hands was, Acts 8. and chapter 19. For as the whole Gospel
was confirmed by Signs and Wonders, Heb. 2. 3, 4.
and diverse Miracles and Gifts of the Holy Ghost in general, so was every
Ordinance in like manner confirmed in particular.

Of the Lord's Supper. A 4* 4* ^at. 26. 26, 27, 28. Mark 14. 21, 22, 23. Luke
22. 19, 20. 1 Cor. 11. 23, 24, 25, 26, 27. Acts 20. 17.

XXIV. WE believe that the Holy Ordinance of the Lord's Supper, which he
instituted the Night before he was betrayed, ought to be observed to the end of
the World; and that it consists only in breaking of Bread, and drinking of
Wine, in remembrance of Christ's Death; it being appointed for our spiritual
Nourishment, and Growth in Grace, and as a farther Engagement in, and to all
Duties we owe to Jesus Christ, and as a Pledge of his eternal Love to us, and as
a Token of our Communion with him, and one with another. And that due
Preparation and Examination is required of all that ought to partake thereof;
and that it cannot be neglected by any approved and orderly Member without Sin.

Of Church Officers.
XXV. WE do believe that every particular Church 1 Timothy 3. 1, 2, etc. Tit. 1. 5.
of Christ is Independent; and that no one Church has any Priority or
Super-intendency above or over another: and that every Church ought to be
Organical: that an Elder, or Elders, a Deacon, or Deacons, ought to be elected
in every Congregation, according to those holy Qualifications 1 Timothy 3. 2 -- 12.
laid down in the Word of God: and that the said Elders and Deacons so chosen,
ought solemnly to be ordained with Prayer, and laying on of Hands of the
Eldership. Tit. 1. 5, 6, 7, 8. Acts 13. 3. 1 Timothy 5. 22. and 4. 14.
That such Churches as have not Officers so ordained, are disorderly, there
being something still wanting.

Of Prayer.
XXVI. WE believe Prayer is Phil. 4. 6. Psalm. 65. 2. John 4. 23. 1 Pet. 2. 5.
Romans 8. 26. John 5. 14. Psalm. 47. 7. Eccl. 5. 1, 2. Jam. 5. 16. Ephesians. 6. 18. 1
Cor. 14. 14. Col. 4. 2. Josh. 24. 15. Genesis 18. 19.
a holy Ordinance of God, and that it ought to be performed by the Help and
Assistance of the Holy Spirit; and that not only the Prayer Christ taught his
Disciples, but the whole Word of God is to be our Rule how to pray, and pour
forth our Souls unto God: and that it is the indispensible Duty of all godly
Families (and others also) as well as private Christians, daily to pray for all
things they need, and to give Thanks every Day for all good things they
receive: and that the Omission of this Duty is a great Scandal to Religion, and
a Jer. 10. 25.
great Evil when it is carelessly or negligently performed.

Of singing of Psalms, etc.
XXVII. WE believe that singing Ephesians. 5. 19. Col. 3. 16.
the Praises of God, is a holy Ordinance of Christ, and not a part of Natural
Religion, or a moral Duty only; but that it is brought under Divine
Institution, it being injoined on the Churches of Christ to sing Psalms, Hymns,
and spiritual Songs; and Acts 16. 25 Heb. 2. 12. Jam. 5. 13.
that the whole Church in their Public Assemblies (as well as private
Christians) ought to sing God's Praises, according to the best Light they have
received. Moreover, it was practiced in the great Representative Church, by our
Lord Jesus Christ with his Disciples, after he Mat. 26. 30 Mar. 14. 26
had instituted and celebrated the Sacred Ordinance of his Holy Supper, as a
commemorative Token of Redeeming Love.

Of the Christian Sabbath.
XXVIII. WE believe that one Day in seven, ought to be solemnly observed in
Exodus 20.
the Worship of God; and that by Moses's Law the Jews and proselyted Strangers
were to keep the seventh Day: but from the Resurrection of Christ the first Day
of the Week ought by all Christians to be observed Holy to the Lord, that being
called the Lord's Day; Rev. 1. 10.
and the first time the Church met together after Christ's Ascension Act. 2. 1,
2. Acts 20. 7.
was on the Day of Pentecost, which was the first Day of the Week, as Tradition
has handed it down: and on that Day the Church also met together to break
Bread, and 1 Cor. 16. 2
make Collections for the poor Saints: and no mention is made that any one
Gospel Church kept the Jewish Sabbath in all the New Testament. And we believe
that an Apostolical Precedent is equivalent to an Apostolical Precept in this
case.

Of Ministers, and their Maintenance.
XXIX. WE do believe that every Brother that has received a Gift to preach,
having first passed the Probation of the Church, and being regularly called by
the same, ought to exercise 1 Timothy 3. 2. Ephesians. 4. 11.
the said Gift to the Edification of the Church when desired; and that no
Brother ought to take 1 Pet. 4. 10 Romans 12. 6, 7.
upon him to preach, until he has a lawful Call so to do.

Moreover, we believe that it is the indispensible Duty of every Church,
according to their Ability, to provide their Pastor, or 1 Cor. 9. 9 -- 14. Romans
15. 2^. Gal. 6. 6. 1 Timothy 5. 15.
Elders, a comfortable Maintenance; as God has ordained, that he that preaches
the Gospel, should live of the Gospel, and not of his own Labor; but that he
should wholly give himself up to the Work of the Ministry, and to watch over
the Flock, being to be freed from all secular Business, and Encumbrances of the
World: and yet that it is abominable Evil for any Man to preach the Gospel for
filthy lucre sake, but he must do 2 Pet. 5. 2.
it of a ready mind.

Of the First Covenant.
XXX. WE believe that the first Covenant, or Covenant Genesis 2. 17.
of Works, was primarily made with Adam, and with all Mankind in him, by virtue
of Romans 3. 12.
which he stood in a justified state before the Fall, upon the condition of his
own perfect and personal Romans 10. 5. and 5. 10 to 20.
Obedience. But by the Fall he made himself incapable of Life by that Covenant.

That the Law God gave by Moses to Israel, was of the same nature of that given
to Adam, being a second Romans 3. 19, 20. 2 Cor. 3. 9, 11.
Ministration of it; but not given for Life, but to make Sin exceeding sinful,
and to show how unable Man was in his fallen state to Romans 7. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,
12, 13.
fulfill the Righteousness of God; and so (with the Ceremonial Law) it was given
in subserviency to the Gospel, as a Schoolmaster to bring Gal. 3. 10.
Sinners to Christ.

Of the New and Second Covenant.
XXXI. WE believe the Covenant of Grace was primarily made with the second
Zech. 6. 13.
Adam, and in him with all the Elect, who as God-man, or Mediator, was set up
from everlasting as a Common Person, or as their Romans 3. 23, 24, 25, 26. Isa.
57. 5, 6, 10, 11.
Head and Representative; who freely obliged or engaged himself to the Father
for them, perfectly to keep the whole Law in their Nature that had sinned, and
to Romans 8. 3. Heb. 9. 15, 16, 17.
satisfy Divine Justice by bearing their Sins upon his own Body, i. e. the
Guilt of all their Sins, which were laid upon him: and that he Heb. 7. 22.
sustained that Wrath and Curse in his Body and Soul, that was due Luke 22.
2(...)
to them for all their Transgrestions: and having received their discharge 1
Cor. 11. 2(...)
from Wrath and Condemnation, he gives it out to all that believe in him, and
obtain Union Romans 6. 2(...) and 8. 16, 17, 18.
with him, who are thereby brought actually into the said New Covenant, and
have a personal Right to all the Blessings thereof.

Of Election.
XXXII. WE do believe that God from all Eternity, according unto the most wise
and holy Counsel of his own Will, freely and unchangeably decreed Romans 8. 29,
30, 31.
and ordained, for the manifestation of his own Glory, some Angels, and some of
the lost Sons and Daughters of Adam, unto Acts 13. 48.
eternal Life; and that their number is so certain and definite, that it cannot
be either increased or diminished: and that others are left or passed by under
a Decree of Preterition. And that those of Manking that are predestined Romans
9. 11.
and foreordained, are particularly and personally designed unto eternal
(...). These. 4. 4, 5.
Life: and these God, according to his eternal and immutable Purpose, and good
pleasure of his Will, did choose in Christ (...)ph. 1. 3, 4, 11.
(the Head of this Election) unto everlasting Glory, of his mere free Grace,
without any foreseen Faith 2 Thessalonians. 2. 13.
or Obedience and Perseverance therein, or any thing in the Creature as a
Condition or Cause moving him thereunto; and all this only to the Praise of his
own glorious Grace.

Of final Perseverance.
XXXIII. WE believe all those whom God has chosen, and who are effectually
called, justified, and sanctified in Jesus Christ, can neither totally, Romans 8.
28, 29, 30, 31.
nor finally fall away from a state of Grace; but shall certainly persevere
therein unto the end, and eternally be saved; and this by Joh. 10. 28, 29. Romans
8. 38, 39 Romans 8. 3(...) 33, 3(...)
virtue of their Election, or the immutable Decree of God, and the unchangeable
Love of God the Father; and by virtue of their Union with Christ, together with
his Death, Resurrection, and Intercession; as also from the nature of the
Covenant of Grace, and 2 Timothy 2.
Suretyship of Christ; and through the indwelling of the holy Spirit, who
abides in them for ever. 2 Cor. 6. 17.


Of the Resurrection.
XXXIV. WE believe that the Bodies of all Men, both the Just and Unjust, shall
rise again at the last day, even the same numerical Bodies that die; tho the
Bodies of the Saints shall be raised immortal and incorruptible, and be made
like Christ's glorious Body: and that the dead in Christ shall rise first.

Of Eternal Judgment.
XXXV. WE believe that God has appointed a Day in which he will judge the Acts
17. 31.
World in Righteousness by Jesus Christ, or that there shall be a general Day
of Judgment, when all shall stand before the Judgmentseat of Christ, and give
an account 2 Cor. 5. 10.
to him for all things done in this Body: and that he will pass an eternal
Sentence upon all, according as their Works shall be. Eccles. 12.


Of Marriages.
XXXVI. WE believe Marriage Genesis 3. 24.
is God's holy Ordinance, that is to say between one Man and one Woman: and
Mat. 19. 5.
that no Man ought to have more than one Wife at once: and that 1 Cor. 6. 16.
Believers that marry, should marry in the Lord, or such that are Ephesians. 5. 31.
Believers, or Godly Persons; and that those who do otherwise, sin Romans 7. 4.
greatly, in violating God's holy Precept: and that Ministers as well as others
may marry; for Marriage Heb. 13. 4.
is honorable in all.

Of Civil Magistrates.
XXXVII. WE do believe the Romans 13. 1, 2, 3.
supreme Lord of Heaven and Earth has ordained Magistrates for the good of
Mankind: and that it is our Duty Tit. 3. 1.
in all civil and lawful things to obey them for Conscience sake; nay, and to
pray for all that are 1 Pet. 2. 13:
in Authority, that under them we may live a godly and peaceable Life: and that
we ought to render unto Caesar the things that are Cesar's, Mat. 22. 21.
and to God the things that are God's.

Of lawful Oaths.
XXXVIII. WE do believe it is lawful to take some Oaths before the Civil
Magistrate; Exodus 20. 7. Jer. 4. 2. Genesis 24. 2. Neh. 5. 12. Heb. 6. 16, 17.
an Oath of Confirmation being to put an end to all Strife: nay, and that it is
our Duty so to do when lawfully called thereunto: and that those that swear,
ought to swear in Truth, in Righteousness, and in Judgment.

Of Personal Propriety.
XXXIX. WE do believe that every Man has a Exodus 20. 17. Acts 5. 4. and 20. 33.
just and peculiar Right and Propriety in his own Goods, and that they are not
common to others; yet we believe that every Man is obliged to administer to the
poor Saints, and to the public Interest of God, according to his Ability, or
as God has blessed him.

FINIS.
POSTSCRIPT.
THere is something contained in the 13th Article that may seem to want some
Explication, in these words (speaking of a Man actually and personally
justified) that his Sins past, present, and to come, are all forgiven: We
believing that if any Sins of a justified Person were afterward charged upon
him, it must of necessity make a breach in his unalterable and everlasting
Justification, which is but one Act in God; hence there is no Condemnation to
them which Romans 8. 1.
are in Christ Jesus: yet I find an able and worthy Writer distinguishes
Pardon Mr. Tho. Gilbert.
of Sin thus, viz.

1. Fundamentally in Christ, as a common Person of all the Elect before Faith,
which lies in Christ making full Satisfaction for all their Sins, meriting
Faith for them, etc.

2. Actual, of all the Elect in Christ on believing; this actual Pardon being
nothing else but the actual Possession in their own Persons of their
fundamental Pardon in the Person of Christ: And Dr. Tho. Goodwin speaks to the
same purpose, to which I agree. And that this actual Pardon of the legal Guilt
is twofold.

1. Formal, of all their Sins past, removing their legal Guilt.

2. Virtual, of all their Sins to come, preventing their legal Guilt. Dr. Ames
speaks to the same purpose, and many others. I cannot see how a Believer should
be for ever formally justified from all Sins past, present, and to come, and
yet not formally pardoned.

This Author which I have lately met with, distinguishes well between Legal
Guilt and Gospel Guilt; the first obliging to Divine Wrath, or eternal
Punishment; the latter, i. e. Gospel Guilt, obliging to Gospel, or Fatherly
Chastisement for Gospel-Sins. Now I see not but Dr. Ames says, that not only
the Sins of a justified Person that are past are remitted, but also in some
sort those to come, Number. 23. 25. Joh. 5. 24. yet he distinguishes between a
formal and virtual Pardon: Sins past, says he, are remitted in themselves, Sins
to come, in the Subject o^ Person sinning.
that as soon as a Believer is personally justified, all his Sins, tho not yet
committed, as to legal Guilt, or vindictive Wrath, i. e. that Guilt that
obliges to eternal Condemnation, are pardoned, for the reason before.

Says he, Virtual Pardon keeps off Legal Guilt where it would be. To which I
reply, if it be kept off, so that it never comes upon Believers, then it
follows they were actually pardoned before in that respect: yet he says, Sins
cannot be said to be formally pardoned before formally committed; but says, no
Guilt can come upon them to Condemnation, tho new Guilt; yet no new legal
Guilt, because always justified. We see no hurt if his Terms be admitted.

Object. What do Believers then pray for, when they pray for the Pardon of Sin?

Answ. 1. That God would not chastise them sorely, or afflict them as a Father,
according to the greatness of their Offenses.

2. That if his chastning Hand is upon us, he would be pleased graciously to
remove it.

3. That he would be pleased to clear up to our Consciences, or give us the
evidence of our Pardon through Christ's Merits, and that we may know we are
complete in Christ, or without spot before the Throne in our free Justification.

4. Nay, Believers are to pray to God to remove that Sin from them (says this
worthy Author) whose desert of Punishment cannot be removed from it; and to
spread their Sins before the Lord in the highest sense of the deepest demerit
of all legal Punishment, so that they may put the higher accent upon the free
Grace of God, and estimate upon the full Satisfaction of Christ, whereby their
Persons are so fully freed from all actual Obligation to any Legal Punishment,
the whole and utmost whereof their Sins deserve.

5. Moreover, that God would continue, and never revoke his most gracious
Pardon, till he pronounces the final Sentence of it at the day of Judgment,
(as well this Author notes) for a renewed sense and assurance of its grant and
continuance: and thus to pray, says he, there are both Precepts and Promises.
