TO My worthily honored Friend, Sir W. S. Knight.
SIR,
I Have many thanks to give you for the Book you pleased to send me, called The
Popish Royal Favorite; and according to your advice (which I value in a high
degree) I put Pen to Paper, and some thing you may see I have don (though in a
poor Pamphleting way) to clear my self of those aspersions that are cast upon
me therein. But truly Sir, I was never so unfit for such a task; al my papers,
Manuscripts, and Notes, having been long since seized upon and kept from me.
Add hereunto, that besides this long pressure and languishment of twenty three
months close restraint (the sense whereof, I find has much stupefied my
spirits) it pleased God to visit me lately with a dangerous fit of sickness, a
high burning Fever, with the new Disease, whereof my Body as well as my Mind, is
yet somewhat crazy: So that (take all afflictions together) I may truly say, I
have passed the Ordeal, the fiery Trial. But it has pleased God to reprieve me
to see better days I hope; for out of this fatal black Cloud, which now oresets
this poor Island, I hope there will break a glorious Sunshine of peace and firm
happiness: To effect which, had I a Jury, a Grand Jury of lives, I would
sacrifice them all, and triumph in the oblation.

So I most affectionately kiss your hands, and rest

From the Prison of the Fleet. Your faithful (though afflicted) Servant, J. H.

The Pre-eminence of Parliament.
Sectio Prima.
I Am a freeborn Subject of the Realm of England; whereby I claim as my native
Inheritance, an undoubted right, propriety, and portion in the Laws of the
Land: And this distinguishes me from a Slave. I claim also an interest and
common right in the High National Court of Parliament, and in the Power, the
Privileges and Jurisdiction thereof, which I put in equal balance with the
Laws, in regard it is the Fountain whence they spring: And this I hold also to
be a principal part of my Birthright; which great Council I honor, respect,
value, and love in as high a degree as can be; as being the Bulwark of our
Liberties, the main boundary and bank which keep us from slavery, from the
inundations of tyrannical Rule, and unbounded Wil-government. And I hold my
self obliged in a tie of indispensable obedience to conform and submit my self
to whatsoever shall be transacted, concluded, and constituted by its authority
in Church or State; whether it be by making, enlarging, altering, diminishing,
disanulling, repealing, or reviving of any Law, Statute, Act, or Ordinance
whatsoever, either touching matters Ecclesiastical, Civil, Common, Capital,
Criminal, Martial, Maritine, Municipal, or any other; of all which, the
transcendent and uncontrolable Jurisdiction of that Court is capable to take
cognizance.

Amongst the three things which the Athenian Captain thanked the gods for, one
was, That he was born a Grecian, and not a Barbarian. For such was the vanity
of the Greeks, and after them of the Romans, in the flourish of their Monarchy,
to arrogate all civility to themselves, and to term all the world besides
Barbarians: So I may say to have cause to rejoice, that I was born a vassal to
the Crown of England; that I was born under so well molded and tempered a
Government, which indows the Subject with such Liberties and Infranchisements
that bear up his natural courage, and keep him still in heart; such Liberties
that fence and secure him eternally from the gripes and tallons of Tyranny: And
all this may be imputed to the Authority and Wisdom of this High Court of
Parliament, wherein there is such a rare co ordination of power (though the
Soverainty remain still entire, and untransferable in the person of the
Prince) there is, I say, such a wholesome mixture 'twixt Monarchy, Optimacy, and
Democracy; 'twixt Prince, Peers, and Communalty, during the time of
consultation, that of so many distinct parts, by a rare cooperation and
unanimity, they make but one Body Politic, (like that Sheaf of Arrows in the
Emblem) one entire concentrical piece; and the results of their deliberations,
but as so many harmonious diapasons arising from different strings. And what
greater immunity and happiness can there be to a people, than to be liable to no
Laws but what they make themselves? To be subject to no Contribution,
Assessement, or any pecuniary levy whatsoever, but what they Vote, and
voluntarily yield unto themselves? For in this compacted Politic Body, there be
all degrees of people represented; both the Mechanic, Tradesman, Merchant, and
Yeoman, have their inclusive Vote, as well as the Gentry, in the persons of
their Trustees, their Knights and Burgesses, in passing of all things. Nor is
this Soverain Surintendent Council an Epitome of this Kingdom only, but it
may be said to have a representation of the whole Universe; as I heard a fluent
well-worded Knight deliver the last Parliament, who compared the beautiful
composure of that High Court, to the great Work of God, the World it self:
The King to the Sun, the Nobles to the fixed Stars, the Itinerant Judges and
other Officers (that go upon Messages' twixt both Houses) to the Panets; the
Clergy to the Element of fire; the Commons, to the solid Body of Earth, and the
rest of the Elements. And to pursue this comparison a little farther; as the
heavenly Bodies, when three of them meet in Conjunction, do use to produce some
admirable effects in the Elementary World: So when these three States convene
and assemble in one solemn great Junto, some notable and extraordinary things
are brought forth, tending to the welfare of the whole Kingdom, our Microcosm.

HE that is never so little versed in the Annals of this Isle, will find that
it has bin her fate to be sour times conquered. I exclude the Scot; for the
situation of his Country, and the quality of the Clime has bin such an
advantage and security to him, that neither the Roman Eagles would fly thither,
for fear of Freezing their Wings; nor any other Nation attempt the work.

These so many Conquests must needs bring with them many tumblings and
tossings, many disturbances and changes in Government; yet I have observed,
that notwithstanding these tumblings, it retained still the form of a Monarchy,
and something there was always that had an Analogy with the great Assembly the
Parliament.

The first Conquest I find was made by Claudius Caesar; at which time (as some
well observe) the Roman Ensigns and the Standard of Christ came in together. It
is well known what Laws the Roman had; He had his Comitia, which bore a
resemblance with our Convention in Parliament; the place of their meetings was
called Praetorium, and the Laws which they enacted, Plebiscita.

The Saxon Conquest succeeded next, which were the English, there being no name
in Welsh or Irish for an Englishman, but Saxon, to this day. They governed by
Parliament, though it were under other names; as Michel Sinoth, Michel Gemote,
and Witenage Mote.

There are Records above a thousand years old, of these Parlements, in the
Raigns of King Ina, Offa, Ethelbert, and the rest of the seven Kings during the
Heptarchy. The British Kings also, who retained a great while some part of the
Isle unconquered, governed and made Laws by a kind of Parlementary way; witness
the famous Laws of Prince Howel, called Howel Dha, (the good Prince Howel)
whereof there are yet extant some Welsh Records. Parlements were also used after
the Heptarchy by King Kenulphus, Alphred, and others; witness that renowned
Parliament held at Grately by King Athelstan.

The third Conquest was by the Danes, and they governed also by such general
Assemblies, (as they do to this day) witness that great and so much celebrated
Parliament held by that mighty Monarch Canutus, who was King of England,
Denmark, Norway, and other Regions 150 years before the compiling of Magna
Charta; and this the learned in the Laws do hold to be one of the specialest,
and most authentic pieces of Antiquity we have extant. Edward the Confessor
made all his Laws thus, (and he was a great Legis-lator) which the Norman
Conqueror (who liking none of his sons, made God Almighty his heir,
bequeathing unto him this Island for a Legacy) did ratify and establish, and
digested them into one entire methodical Systeme, which being violated by
Rufus, (who came to such a disastrous end, as to be shot to death in lieu of a
Buck for his sacriledges) were restored by Henry the first, and so they
continued in force till King John, whose reign is renowned for first confirming
Magna Charta, the foundation of our Liberties ever since: Which may be compared
to diverse Outlandish Graffs set upon one English stock, or to a Posie of sundry
fragrant Flowers; for the choicest of the British, the Roman, Saxon, Danish,
and Norman Laws, being culled and picked out, and gathered as it were into one
bundle, out of them the foresaid grand Charter was extracted: And the
establishment of this great Charter was the work of a Parliament.

Nor are the Laws of this Island only, and the freedom of the Subject
conserved by Parliament, but all the best policed Countries of Europ have the
like. The Germans have their Diets, the Danes and Swedes the Riicks Dachs; the
Spaniard calls his Parliament Las Cortes, and the French have (or should have at
least) their Assembly of three States, though it be grown now in a manner
obsolete, because the Authority thereof was (by accident) devolved to the King
And very remarkable it is, how this happened; forwhen the English had taken such
large sooting in most parts of France, having advanced as far as Orleans, and
driven their then King Charles the seventh to Bourges in Berry: the Assembly of
the three States in these pressures, being not able to meet after the usual
manner in full Parliament, because the Country was unpassable the enemy having
made such firm invasions up and down through the very bowels of the Kingdom;
that power which formerly was inherent in the Parlementary Assembly, of making
Laws, of assessing the Subject with Taxes, subsidiary levies, and other
impositions, was transmitted to the King during the War; which continuing many
years, that entrusted power by length of time grew as it were habitual in him,
and could never after be reassumed and taken from him; so that ever since, his
Edicts countervail Acts of Parliament. And that which made the business more
seasable for the King, was, that the burden fell most upon the Communalty (the
Clergy and Nobility not feeling the weight of it) who were willing to see the
Peasan pulled down a little, because not many years before in that notable
Rebellion, called La Iaquerie de Beauvoisin, which was suppressed by Charles the
wise, the common people put themselves boldly in Arms against the Nobility and
Gentry, to lessen their power. Add hereunto as an advantage to the work, that
the next succeeding King Lewis the eleventh, was a close cunning Prince, and
could well tell how to play his game, and draw water to his own Mill; For
amongst all the rest, he was said to be the first that put the Kings of France,
Horse de page, out of their minority, or from being Pages any more, though
thereby he brought the poor Peasans to be worse than Lacquays.

With the fall, or at least the discontinuance, of that usual Parlementary
Assembly of the three States, the liberty of the French Nation utterly fell;
the poor Roturier and Vineyard-man, with the rest of the Yeomanry, being
reduced ever since to such an abject asinin condition, that they serve but as
sponges for the King to squeeze when he list. Nevertheles, as that King has an
advantage hereby one way, to monarchize more absolutely, and never to want
money, but to ballast his Purse when he will: so there is another mighty
inconvenience arises to him and his whole Kingdom another way; for this
illegal peeling of the poor Peasan has so dejected him, and cowed his native
courage so much by the sense of poverty (which brings along with it a narrownes
of soul) that he is little useful for the War: which puts the French King to
make other Nations mercenary to him, to fill up his Infantry: Insomuch, that
the Kingdom of France may be not unfitly compared to a body that has all its
blood drawn up into the Arms, Breast and Back, and scarce any left from the
Girdle downwards, to cherish and bear up the lower parts, and keep them from
starving.

All this seriously considered, there cannot be a more proper and pregnant
example than this of our next Neighbors, to prove how infinitely necessary the
Parliament is, to assert, to prop up, and preserve the Public Liberty, and
National Rights of a people, with the incolumity and welfare of a Country.

Nor does the Subject only reap benefit thus by Parliament, but the Prince (if
it be well considered) has equal advantage thereby; It renders him a King of
free and able men, which is far more glorious than to be a King of Slaves,
Beggars, and Bankrupts Men that by their freedom, and competency of (...) are
kept still in heart to do him service against any foreign force. And it is a
true maxim in all States, that it is less danger and dishonor for the Prince
to be poor, than his people: Rich Subjects can make their King rich when they
please; if he gain their hearts, he will quickly get their purses: Parliament
increases love and good intelligence' twixt him and his people; it acquaints
him with the reality of things, and with the true state and diseases of his
Kingdom; it brings him to the knowledge of his better sort of Subjects, and of
their abilities, which he may employ accordingly upon all occasions; it
provides for his Royal Issue, pays his debts, finds means to fill his
Coffers: And it is no ill observation, The Parlementary-moneys (the great Aid)
have prospered best with the Kings of England; it exceedingly raises his
repute abroad, and enableth him to keep his foes in fear, his Subjects in awe,
his Neighbors and Confederates in security, the three main things which go to
aggrandize a Prince, and render him glorious. In sum, it is the Parliament that
supports, and bears up the honor of his Crown, and settles his Throne in
safety, which is the chief end of all their consultations; For whosoever is
entrusted to be a Member of this High Court, carries with him a double
capacity; he fits there as a Patriot, and as a Subject: As he is the one, the
Country is his object, his duty being to vindicate the Public Liberty, to
make wholesome Laws, to put his hand to the pump, and stop the leaks of the great
vessel of the State: to pry into and punish corruption and oppression, to
improve and advance trade, to have the grievances of the place he serves for
redressed, and cast about how to find something that may tend to the advantage
of it.

But he must not forget that he sits there also as a S^^^^ct, and according to
that capacity, he must apply himse^^ to do his Sovereigns business, to provide
not only ^^r his public, but his personal wants; to bear up the luster and
glory of his Court; to consider what occasions of extraordinary expenses he may
have, by increase of Royal Issue, or maintenance of any of them abroad; to
enable him to vindicate any affront or indignity that might be offered to his
Person, Crown, or Dignity, by any foreign State or Kingdom; to consult what may
enlarge his honor, contentment and pleasure. And as the French Tacitus
(Comines) has it, the English Nation was used to be more forward and zealous
in this particular than any other, according to that ancient eloquent speech of
a great Lawyers, Domus Regis vigilia defendit omnium, otium illius labor
omnium, deliciae illius industria omnium, vacatio illius occupatio omnium*
salus illius periculum omnium, honor illius objectum omnium. Every one should
stand Centinell to defend the Kings Houses, his safety should be the danger of
all, his pleasures the industry of all, his ease should be the labor of all,
his honor the object of all.

Out of these premises this conclusion may be easily deduced, that, The
principal Founntain whence the King derives his happiness and safety, is his
Parliament: It is that great Conduit-Pipe which conveighs unto him his peoples
bounty and gratitude; the truest Looking-glass wherein he discerns their
loves; now the Subjects love has bin always accounted the prime Citadel of a
Prince. In his Parliament he appears as the Sun in the Meridian, in the altitude
of his glory, in his highest State Royal, as the Law tells us.

Therefore whosoever is avers or disaffected to this Sovereign Law making Court,
cannot have his heart well planted within him: He can be neither good Subject,
nor good Patriot; and therefore unworthy to breathe English air, or have any
benefit, advantage, or protection from the Laws.

Sectio Secunda.
BY that which has been spoken, which is the language of my heart, I hope no
indifferent judicious Reader will doubt of the cordial affection, of the high
respects and due reverence I bear to Parliament, as being the wholsomest
constitution (and done by the highest and happiest reach of policy) that ever
was established in this Island, to perpetuate the happiness thereof: Therefore I
must tell that Gentleman who was Author of a Book entitled The Popish Royal
Favorite, (lately Printed and exposed to the world) that he offers me very hard
measure; nay, he does me apparent wrong, to term me therein No friend to
Parliament, and a Malignant; A character, which as I deserve it not, so I
disdain it.

For the first part of his charge, I would have him know, that I am as much a
friend, and as real an affectionate humble servant and votary to the Parliament,
as possibly he can be, and will live and die with these affections about me:
And I could wish, that he were Secretary of my thoughts a while; or if I may
take the boldness to apply that comparison His late Majesty used in a famous
speech to one of his Parlements, I could wish there were a Crystal VVindow in
my Breast, through which the world might epsy the inward motions and
palpitations of my heart; then would he be certified of the sincerity of this
protestation.

For the second part of his charge, to be a Malignant, I must confess to have
some Malignity that lurks within me, much against my will, but it is no
malignity of mind, it is amongst the humors, not in my intellectuals. And I
believe, there is no natural man, let him have his humors never so well
balanced, but has some of this malignity reigning within him; For as long as
we are composed of the four Elements, whence these humors are derived, and
with whom they symbolize in qualities; which Elements the Philosophers hold to
be in a restless contention amongst themselves (and the Stoic thought that
the world subsisted by this innate mutual strife) as long, I say, as the four
humors, in imitation of their principles (the Elements) are in perpetual
reluctance and combat for praedominancy, there must be some malignity lodged
within us, as adusted choler, and the like; whereof I had late experience in a
dangerous fit of sickness it pleased God to lay upon me, which the Physicians
told me proceeded from the malignant hypocondriacal effects of melancholy;
having been so long in this Saturnine black condition of close imprisonment,
and buried a live between the Walls of this fatal Fleet. These kinds of
malignities, I confess are very rife in me, and they are not only incident, but
connaturall to every man according to his complexion: And were it not for this
incessant struggling and enmity amongst the humors for mastery, which produces
such malignant effects in us, our souls would be loath ever to depart from our
bodies, or to abandon this mansion of clay.

Now what malignity my Accuser means, I know not; if he means malignity of
spirit, as some antipathy or ill impression upon the mind, arising from
disaffection, hatred, or rancor, with a desire of some destructive revenge, he
is mightily deceived in me; I malign or hate no Creature that ever God made,
but the Devil, who is the Author of all malignity; and therefore is most
commonly called in French le Malin Asprit the malignant spirit. Every night
before I go to bed, I have the grace, I thank God for it, to forgive all the
world, and not to harbor, or let roost in my bosom the least malignant
thought; yet none can deny, but the aspersions which this my Accuser casts upon
me, were enough to make me a malignant toward him; yet it could never have the
power to do it: For I have prevailed with my self to forgive him this his wrong
censure of me, issuing rather from his not-knowledg of me, than from malice;
for we never mingled speech, or saw one another in our lives, to my
remembrance: which makes me wonder the more, that a Professor of the Law, as he
is, should pronounce such a positive sentence against me so slightly. But me
thinks I over-hear him say, That the precedent discourse of Parliament is
involved in generals, and the Topique Axiom tells us, that Dolus versatur in
universalibus, there is double dealing in universals: His meaning is, that I am
no friend to this present Parliament (though he speaks in the plural number
Parlements) and consequently, he concludes me a Malignant. Therein, I must tell
him also, that I am traduced, and I am confident it will be never proved
against me, from any Actions, words, or letters (though diverse of mine have bin
intercepted) or any other misdemeanor, though some things are fathered upon me
which never dropped from my Quill. Alas, how unworthy and incapable am I to
censure the proceedings of that great Senate, that high Synedrion, wherein the
wisdom of the whole State is epitomized? It were a presumption in me, of the
highest nature that could be: It is enough for me to pray for the prosperous
success of their consultations: And as I hold it my duty, so I have good reason
so to do, in regard I am to have my share in the happiness; And could the utmost
of my poor endeavors, by any ministerial humble office (and sometimes the
meanest Boatswain may help to preserve the Ship from sinking) be so happy, as
to contribute any thing to advance that great work (which I am in despair to
do, while I am thus under hatches in this Fleet) I would esteem it the greatest
honor that possibly could befall me, as I hold it now to be my greatest
disaster, to have fallen so heavily under an affliction of this nature, and to be
made a sacrifice to public fame, than which there is no other proof, nor that
yet urged against me, or any thing else produced after so long, so long
captivity, which has brought me to such a low ebb, and put me so far behind
in the course of my poor fortunes, and indeed more than half undon me. For
although my whole life (since I was left to my self to swim, as they say,
without bladders) has bin nothing else but a continued succession of crosses,
and that there are but few red letters found (God wot) in the Almanac of my
Age, (for which I account not my self a whit the less happy;) yet this cross
has carried with it a greater weight; it has bin of a larger extent, longer
continuance, and lighted heavier upon me than any other; and as I have present
patience to bear it, so I hope for subsequent grace to make use of it
accordingly, that my old Motto may be still confirmed, (...).

HE produces my attestation for some passages in Spain, at His Majesty's being
there, and he quotes me aright, which obliges me to him: And I hope all his
quotations, wherein he is so extraordinarily copious and elaborate in all his
works, are so; yet I must tell him, that those interchangeable Letters which
passed between His Majesty and the Pope, which were originally couched in
Latin, the language wherein all Nations treat with Rome, and the Empire with
all the Princes thereof; those Letters, I say, are adulterated in many places,
which I impute not to him, but to the French Chroniclen, from whom he took them
in trust. The truth of that business is this: The world knows there was a tedious
treaty of an Alliance 'twixt the Infanta Dona Maria (who now is Empress) and
His Majesty, which in regard of the slow affected pace of the Spaniard, lasted
about ten years, as that in Henry the sevenths time, 'twixt Prince Arthur and
(afterward) Queen Katherine, was spun out above seven: To quicken, or rather
to consummate the work, His Majesty made that adventurous journey through the
whole Continent of France into Spain; which voyage, though there was a great
deal of gallantry in it (whereof all posterity will ring, until it turn at
last to a Romance) yet it proved the bane of the business, which it is not the
arrand of so poor a Pamphlet as this to unfold. His Majesty being there arrived,
the ignorant common people cried out, the Prince of Wales came thither to make
himself a Christian. The Pope writ to the Inquisitor General, and others, to
use all industry they could to reduce him to the Roman Religion; And one of
Olivares first complements to him, was, That he doubted not but that His
Highness came thither to change His Religion: Whereunto he made a short answer,
That he came not thither for a Religion, but for a Wife. There were extraordinay
processions made, and other artifices used by protraction of things to make him
stay there of purpose till the Spring folllowing, to work upon him the better:
And the Infanta her self desired him (which was esteemed the greatest favor he
received from her all the while) to visit the Nun of Carrion; hoping that the
said Nun, who was so much cried up for miracles, might have wrought one upon
him; but her art failed her, nor was His Highness so weak a subject to work
upon, according to His late Majesty's speech to Doctor Mawe and Wren, who when
they came to kiss his hands, before they went to Spain to attend the Prince
their Master, He wished them to have a care of Buckingham; as touching his Son
Charles, he apprehended no fear at all of him; for he knew him to be so well
grounded a Protestant, that nothing could shake him in his Religion. The
Arabian Proverb is, That the Sun never soiles in his passage, though his Beams
reverberate never so strongly, and dwell never so long upon the Myry lake of
Maeotis, the black Turf'd Moors of Holland, the Aguish Woose of Kent and Essex,
or any other place, be it never so dirty. Though Spain be a hot Country, yet
one may pass and repasse through the very Center of it, and never be
Sunburned, if he carry with him a Bongrace, and such a one His Majesty had.

Well, after His Majesty's arrival to Madrid, the treaty of Marriage went on
still, (though he told them at his first coming, that he came not thither like
an Ambassador, to treat of Marriage; but as a Prince, to fetch home a Wife;)
and in regard they were of different Religions, it could not be done without a
dispensation from the Pope, and the Pope would grant none, unless some
Capitulations were stipulated in favor of the Romish Catholics in England,
(the same in substance were agreed on with France. Well, when the dispensation
came, which was negotiated solely by the King of Spains Ministers; because His
Majesty would have as little to do as might be with Rome, Pope Gregory the
fifteenth, who died a little after, sent His Majesty a Letter, which was
delivered by the Nuncio, whereof an answer was sent a while after: Which Letters
were imprinted and exposed to the view of the world, because His Majesty would
not have people whisper, that the business was carried in a clandestine manner.
And truly besides this, I do not know of any Letter, or Message, or Complement,
that ever passed 'twixt His Majesty and the Pope, before or after; some addresses
peradventure might be made to the Cardinals, to whom the drawing of those
matrimonial dispatches was referred, to quicken the work; but this was only by
way of civil negotiation.

Now touching that Responsory Letter from His Majesty, it was not other than a
Complement in the severest interpretation, and such formalities pass 'twixt the
Crown of England, and the great Turk, and diverse Heathen Princes. The Pope writ
first, and no man can deny, but by all moral rules, and in common humane
civility His Majesty was bound to answer it, specially considering how punctual
they are in those Countries to correspond in this kind, how exact they are in
repaying visits, and the performance of such Ceremonies: And had this
compliance bin omitted, it might have made very ill impressions, as the posture
of things stood then; for it had prejudiced the great work in hand, I mean, the
Match, which was then in the heat and hight of agitation: His Majesty's person
was there engaged, and so it was no time to give the least offense. They that
are never so little versed in business abroad, do know that there must be
addresses, compliances, and formalities of this nature (according to the
Italian Proverb, That one must sometimes light a candle to the Devil) used in
the carriage of matters of State, as this great business was, whereon the eyes
of all Christendom were so greedily fixed: A business which was like to bring
with it such an universal good, as the restitution of the Palatinate, the
quenching of those hideous fires in Germany, and the establishing of a peace
through all the Christian World.

I hope none will take offense, that in this particular which comes within the
compass of my knowledge, being upon the Stage when this Scene was acted, I do
this right to the King my Master, in displaying the Truth, and putting her
forth in her own colors, a rare thing in these days.

TOuching the Vocal Forest, an allegorical Discourse, that goes abroad under my
name, a good while before the beginning of this Parliament, which this Gentleman
cites (and that very faithfully) I understand there be some that mutter at
certain passages therein, by putting ill glosses upon the Text, and taking with
the left hand what I offer with the right: (Nor is it a wonder for Trees which
lie open, and stand exposed to all weathers, to be nipt) But I desire this
favor, which in common justice, I am sure in the Court of Chancery, cannot be
denied me, it being the privilege of evry Author, and a received maxim through
the World, Cujus est condere, ejus est interpretari; I say, I crave this
favor, to have leave to expound my own Text, and I doubt not then but to
rectify any one in his opinion of me, and that in lieu of the Plums which I
give him from those Trees, he will not throw the stones at me.

Moreover, I desire those that are over critical Censurers of that Piece, to
know, that as in Divinity it is a rule, Scriptura parabolica non est
argumentativa; so it is in all other kind of knowledge, Parables (whereof that
Discourse is composed) though pressed never so hard, prove nothing. There is
another Rule also, That Parables must be gently used, like a Nurses Breast;
which if you press too hard, you shall have blood in stead of milk.

But as the Author of the Vocal Forest thinks he ^ath done, neither his
Country, nor the Commonwealth of Learning any prejudice thereby; (That maiden
fancy having received so good entertainment and respect abroad, as to be
translated into diverse Languages, and to gain the public approbation of some
famous Universities.) So he makes this humble protest unto all the World, that
though the design of that discourse was partly Satirical (which peradventure
induced the Author to shroud it of purpose under the shadows of Trees; and where
should Satyrs be, but amongst Trees?) yet it never entered into his imagination
to let fall from him the least thing that might give any offense to the High
and Honorable Court of Parliament, whereof he had the honor to be once a Member,
and hopes he may be thonght worthy again: And were he guilty of such an
offense, or piacle rather, he thinks he should never forgive himself, though he
were appointed his own Judge. If there occur any passage therein, that may admit
a hard construction, let the Reader observe, That the Author does not
positively assert, or pass a judgment on any thing in that Discourse which
consists principally of concise, cursory narrations of the choicest Occurrences
and Criticisms of State, according as the pulse of time did beat then: And
matters of State, as al^ other sublunary things, are subject to alterations,
contingencies and change, which makes the opinions an^ minds of men vary
accordingly; not one among^ twenty is the same man to day as he was four yeer^
ago, in point of judgment, which turns and alter^ according to the
circumstance and success of things* And it is a true saying, whereof we find
common experience, Posterior dies est prioris Magister. The da^ following is
the former days Schoolmaster. Then another Aphorism, The wisdom of one day is
foolis^nes to another, and 'twill be so as long as there is man left in the
World.

I will conclude with this modest request to that Gentleman of the long Robe;
That having unpassionately perused what I have written in this small Discourse,
in penning whereof my conscience guided my quill all along as well as my hand,
he would please to be so charitable and just, as to reverse that harsh sentence
upon me, To be no Friend to Parlements, and a Malignant.

FINIS.
