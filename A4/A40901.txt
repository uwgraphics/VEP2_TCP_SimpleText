THE Farmers Son of Devonshire: BEING The Valiant Coronet's Return from
Flanders, who endeavored to persuade his, Brother Jack to forsake the Plow,
and to take up Arms the next Spring; which he refused to do, because he was
loath to have his sweet Wife Joan.
Tune of Mary live long
Licensed according to Order.





Well met Brother Jack,
I have been in Flanders,
With valiant Commanders,
And am returned back
to England again,
Where a while I shall stay,
And shall then march away;
I Am an Officer now;
Go wi^h me dear Brother,
Go with me dear Brother,
and lay by the Plow.
I tell thee Old Boy,
The Son of a Farmer
In glittering Armor,
May kill and destroy,
as many proud French,
As a 'Squire or Knight,
having Courage to fight,
then Valiantly go
In Arms like a Soldier,
In Arms like a Soldier,
to face the proud Foe.
But, dear Brother Will.
you are a vine Vellow,
and talk mighty Mellow,
But what if they kill
thy poor Brother Jack,
By the Pounce of a Gun,
If they should I Am undone,
and ruined quite,
You know that I never,
You know that I never,
had Courage to fight
If you will advance
in Arms like a Soldier,
the Nation's Vpholder,
A fortunate Chance
your Portion may be:
All that goes are not slain,
You may return again,
with Victory here,
There Is no Men but Cowards,
There Is no Men but Cowards,
are subject to fear,
Each timorous Soul,
when Trumpets are sounding,
and Cannons rebounding,
he fears no control,
nor Death in the least,
When the Smoke does arise,
And darkens the Skies,
we fall on amain,
That Trophies of Honor,
That Trophies of Honor,
in Field we may gain.
King William you know,
in heat of the Battle,
when Guns they do rattle,
he venters also,
then what shall we fear,
When an Army is lead
By a Crowned Royal Head,
it baffles all fear,
And makes Soldiers fire.
And makes Soldiers fire,
from the Front to the Rear.
JACK's Answer
The King, I confess,
he ^^rours by power,
the French to devour;
Let Providence bless
his conquering Arms:
I would do the sam^ thing,
If I were to be King,
and make the French groan,
Till then loving Brother,
Till then, loving Brother,
pray let me alone.
The Enemies Men
with Horror will fill me,
perhaps they may kill me,
And where am I then?
this runs in my mind;
Should I chance to be Lame,
Will the Trophies of Fame
keep me from sad Groans,
A Fig for that Honor.
A Fig for that Honor,
which brings broken Bones.
Such Honor I scorn,
I Would rather be Mowing,
nay, Plowing or Sowing,
Or threshing of Corn,
at home in a Barn,
Then to leave Joan my Wife,
And to loose my sweet Life,
in Peace let me dwell;
I am not for fighting,
I am not for fighting,
so Brother Farewell.
Printed for J. Deacon, at the Angel in Gilt-spur-street, without Newgate.
