THE JUST REQUEST OF The Officers, and Soldiers of this ARMY, under the
Command of his Excellency Sr. Thomas Fairfax, to their free Elected Council
Agitators,
Right worthy, and betrusted Servants to this Kingdom and ARMI^,
ACcordingly as we by our free Election, have betrusted and conferred our own
natural and inherent power upon you, to be come Agitators in our behalfs for
the good of the Army, the Parliament and Kingdom, and so consequently, for the
safety, freedom, and liberty of every free man of England: We do desire, that
you would like faithful servants unto us discharge your trust and utmost
endeavors for and toward the effectual relief and speedy deliverance of the
unjustly imprisoned and oppressed of the Land; And in Order thereunto, we here
offer a Petition unto your just and speedy concurrence with us in the
premises, on and in the behalf of Leiutenant Colonel John Lilburne, Richard
Overton (this Kingdoms and Armies Appellant) his Wife, Brother, and others
unjustly by Prerogative pleasure, contrary to the GREAT CHARTER of England, and
the Petition of Right imprisoned in and about the City of London, the which we
have prepared, and is subscribed by us, to be presented to His Excellency,
earnestly desiring, that as it is your duty, so you would not fail, to become
Petitioners with us in the premises, and so jointly with us implore His
Excellencies concurrence with his Army and Council therein, for the present
safety and deliverance of the said unjustly imprisoned freemen of England.

The Petition follows.
To his Excellency Sir Thomas Fairfax, the just Petition of the Officers and
Soldiers of the Army, under his Command.
SHOWS,
THat whereas we the Officers and Soldiers of this Army, (raised by the great
Authority of this Kingdom, for the just freedom both of Parliament and
people) have in, and ever since our late solemn engagement to and with each
other, to and with the Parliament and Kingdom in our several papers, given
very large hopes to the oppressed of the Kingdom, of impartial justice and
Freedom; And having in a most special manner by our Council of Agitators in
their letter to the Seamen given our most solemn Assurance, upon the faith of
honest men and Soldiers, that (whatever may be suggested by any) we have no
other aims, but that justice might act in all its parts, and to all its ends,
as relating to all estates and persons in the Kingdom, that the yoakes of
oppression might be taken off the necks of all, and Justice equally distributed
to all, and the Rights of any (though now detained from them) restored and
settled upon them; elsewhere in the said Papers expressing our resolution to go
on in the prosecution of so good a work; till we see oppression and
oppressors from us and the Kingdom removed, a firm and happy Peace settled,
and this poor Kingdom from ruin and destruction delivered: And in our last
Declaration giving further assurance and confirmation, that it is our chief
aim to settle peace with truth and righteousness through the Kingdom, that
none may be oppressed in his just freedom and liberties.

So that by these and the like professions, promises, and expressions of ours
in this time of public calamity and distress, we have Administered to the
helpless and destitute, a just cause of Appeal and Address unto us, as a
sure Refuge, to fly to for succor and reli^fe against the merciless devouring
Oppressor.

Whereupon many of the distressed, destitute, oppressed Commons from several
parts of this Kingdom, out of their good opinion of the sincerity and
uprightness of our professions and intentions, have been encouraged to make
their sad complaynts and Addresses unto this Army, by whom as also by your
Excellency they have been entertained with great acceptance and Commiseration:
And amongst the rest we find, and in especial manner take notice of a
certain Appeal from and against certain Gentlemen, residing at Westminster
surprising, usurping, and abusing the place* name, power, and Authority of
Parliament unto the Body of the people, and chiefly to the Body of this Army,
by Richard Overton, who as by his Appeal and otherwise publikly and certainly
appears) has by some Prerogative men of this Kingdom been most barbarously
and inhumanely abused, for no other cause, then for his strict observation and
just vindication of the free Commoners Rights, according to the Great Charter
of England, himself being thrown into the Goal of Newgate, his wife into
Bridewell (both dragged through the streets headlong, through the dirt and
mire) his Brother into Maiden-lane Prison, his house plundered and rifl^d, and
his Children exposed to the streets, and yet for above these 12. months
space, the said Appellant continuing in the said merciless durance, cruel and
unnatural divorse, cannot obtain any justice either for himself, his wife,
or his brother, notwithstanding all the ordinary and formal ways and means
that either by himself or his friends could be used, himself not only
appealing, complaining, and petitioning to the Parliament of England; but also
many thousands of the Gentlemen and yeomen of the Connties of Buckinghamshire,
and Hartfordshire in his, and in the behalf of Lieutenant Colonel ^^hn
Lilburne, etc. yet through the obstruction of the said factious confederate,
traitorous Party in the House could obtain no manner of relief or redress,
in so much, that in pursuance of his and their natural safety and freedom, and
of just determination of his cause, he was (...) the just (although (...)
ordinary (...)) way of Appeal unto the represented body of the people, and in
especial to your Excellency and the Body of this Army, no other visible
formal power for relief and protection appearing in the land, therein
resigning, submitting, offering, and casting his person and cause (as much as
in him lies) into the verge of our solemn Engagement for deliverance and
protection from the foresaid oppressors and tyrants, still surprising and
usurping the place, name, and Authority of the supreme Auth^rity of this
Kingdom: That so in point of Common liberty (wherein every free Commoners
right is concerned) he may be preserved from the unjust trial and censure of
his, this Armies and the Kingdoms open and dec^a^ed enemies, and suffer no
longer nor any further Oppression by them.

And further, whereas according to, and in pursuance of the particular
mentioned under the fifth head of the representations of the Army, we did
earnestly desire that Leiuetenant Colonel John Li^burne, the said Richard
Overton, with others in their condition imprisoned in and about the City of
London, should be put into a speedy, regular and equitable way of trial, or if
the necessity of settling the general affairs of the Kingdom could not admit
their present trial, that then they might have present liberty upon reasonable
security. etc.

Nevertheless, no more justice or freedom can be obtained for them, then if
such a desire of your Excellency, and this Army never had been proposed

Wherefore we your Officers and Soldiers being deeply sensible and
intelligent, how insufferable and distructive, such Anti-parliamentary illegal
proceedings and Commitments are to the Laws, Rights, and Liberties of the
freemen of England how contradictory, derogatory, and contemptory such delays
and d^nyals of justice to the reasonable and just desires of the said Counti^s,
and to the proposal of this Army are, we cannot but in equity (as in duty we
are bound to our own Solemn engagement, and do hereby in pu^suance thereof,
own the said Appellant, to be with us numbered under the verge, power, and
protection of this Army, to be together and equally with us saved and defended
from the further violence, oppression and injustice of the said usurpers and
abusers of the places, name and authority of Parliament, ours and this
Kingdoms open and declared enemies as well as his; resolving, as much as in us
lies, to make good our foresaid professions and promises of justice and right,
to the said Appellant equally as to our selves, in behalf of the Kingdom and
of that common cause of freedom and liberty, wherein the said Appellaent is
engaged for the general safety rights and immunities of the Commons of England
with the loss of his own.

And we do hereby represent our further Resolutions, to confer the utmost of
our endeavors for his, his wives, his Brothers (together with Leiuetenant
Colonel John Lilburne and others imprisoned in the same condition in and about
London) present release and Assumption into the power, custody, and protection
of this Army for the ends and purposes aforesaid, both for a just and free
Parliamentary trial and judgment, and representations according to Law.

Wherefore we humbly beseech your Excellency, that you would be pleased to
concur with us, and with our Council of Agitators who have ^^ready most
justly (concurred therein) for the more orderly effecting thereof, and
representation of the ame to the free Legal Parliament of England* which was
fo^^^d to fly to this Army for refuge, that so no dssatisfaction may be
administered either one ways or other.

And your Petitioners shall pray, etc.

FJNIS:
