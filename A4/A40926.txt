A BRIEF DISCOVERY OF THE Kingdom of ANTICHRIST. And the downfall of it
hastes greatly.

WITH A Difference betwixt the Ordinances of Christ and of Antichrist.

1 THESE. 1.3, 4, 5. The Man of sin, who is exalted above all that is called
God, and sits in the Temple of God, as God showing himself to be God,
deceiving the Simple Ones.

WISDOM now cries out in the Streets, calling out of Babylon, Sodom, and
Egypt, where our Lord has been Crucified; and spiritual wickedness ie now
committed in high places; therefore return and hearken to the vioce of Jesus
Christ, and turn at his reproof.

2 THESE. 1.4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, etc. (...) the Lord is coming in power and great
glory, and Antichrist shall be consumed by the breath of his mouth, and the
brightness of his coming.

This was written by One the World calls A QUAKER, in March 1653.

A Discovery of Antichrists Kingdom, and the downfall of it hastes greatly.
NOw the Kingdom of Jesus Christ is setting up in the spirits of his people;
Dan. 12.
And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great Prince which stands up
for the Children of my people, says the Lord, and there shall be a time of
trouble, such as there never was, since there was a nation, even to that same
time, and at that time there shall be deliverance, every one shall be
delivered, that shall be found written in the book of life, in the day of the
day of the Lords power, Zeph. l. 12.13.
Dan. 12 1. And it shall come to ^asse at that time, that I will search
Jerusalem with Candles, and punish the men that are settled upon their Lees,
that say in their heart the Lord will not do good, neither will he do evil:
Therefore their goods shall become a b^oty, and their houses a desolation, there
shall also build houses but not inhabit them; and they shall plant vincyrds,
but not drink the wine thereof. The great day of the Lord is near, it hastes
greatly, even the voice of the day of the Lord: there the great man shall cry
bitterly. Zeph. 1.14. Now the abomination of desolation spoken of by Daniel the
Prophet stands up; let him that reads understand. Mat 24.
Now the man of sin is revealed, and revealing, even the Son of perdition,
who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God, and sits in
the Temple of God, as God, showing himself to be God, spoken of by the
Apostle, in 2. These. 2.2, 3. and the vialls are to be powered out upon the man
of sin, These 2.3. ^^v. 16.17. (...) 19.
spoken of in the Revelation.

The Pri^sts are the greatest persecutors of the truth of God; now where it is
made manifest in the spirits of the people of God, the Lord has sent to
declare and testify against their deceits and deceivablenesse, whereby they
do deceive the people, and they are raging mad^ because they are discovered;
^^v. 16.10, ^^.
and they persecute, imprison, and petition, and do all that beastly corrupt
wills can invent, to keep the Is^ael^es of God in bondage, that they might
still be Lords and Rulers over Gods heritage, ^^v. 12.15, ^^, 17.
but though Gog and Magog join in battle against the Lamb, yet he shall prevail
and get the victory, and the beast and false Prophet shall be cast into the
lake tha^ burns, ^^v 1^.11, ^^ ^3, etc.
Rev. 19 20. and they that worship the ^east and his Image, and receive his
mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads, the same shall drink of the
wine of the wrath of the Almighty, poured forth into the cup of his
indignation, and shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of
the holy Angels, and in the presence of the Lamb, and the smoke of their
torment ascends up for ever and ever; and they shall have no rest day nor
night that worship the B^ast, Rev. 14.9, 10, 11.

Come out of the beastly worships God is a Spirit, Th. 4.23, ^^.
and he will be worshipped in spirit, and the glorious Lord will be unto his a
place of broad River and streams of l^ve, (...). 33.21.^^.54 13. ^^eb. 8 ^^.^^.
and peace, and joy, and rejoicing for ever and ever, and all the children of
the Lord are taught of the Lord, he is Teacher alone by his spirit, and
causes people to profit by his Ministry. Therefore cease who^ly from all your
Priests, (...). 2.22. John 2.
they are Decivers, and lead you from the teachings of the spirit, to observe
dreams, and fancies of their own brame, and are the upholders of pride,
(...). 23.30, ^^* 32.33.
coverousnesse, and oppression, and never were yet taught themselves; they are
in he state and condition that the false Prophets were in, all teaching for
hire, and are Lords and Rulers over the people, and ran but the Lord did never
send them, as those did, that the Lord sent his true Prophets to cry out
against, as in Jer. 23. and Jer. 5 30, 31. and Isaiah 56.10, 11. Ezekiel 34. Mitha
3.11. Hosea 6.9. As a troop of Robbers wait for a man, so the Priests they
murder in the way by consent. Now the Scripture is fulsilling, Hos. 6.9.
the Beast makes warte with the Saints; those beastly Priests make themselves
manifest, that they are of the generation of Cain, and are of their Father the
Devil, persecuting and imprisoning the servants of the Lord, as the Jewish
Highpriests did. Persecution is begun here in Yorkshire, by the Priests of
Baal, they cannot defend their Ministry any ways, but by an outward Law, when
any are moved by the Lord to speak against their deceits, they run away, as
the Priest of Finningley did, and he Priest of Arkworth and others did, and
will not stand to their floc^s, but leave them, but the Scriptures is
fulfilling, Joh. 10.12 13.
the hireling flees because he is an hireling. See if this be not contrary to
that of the true Shepherd, that lays down his life for the Sheep, John
10.11. and 15, 16, 17. verses.

They take the words of the good Shepherd to speak of, but deny to live his
life; and they walk contrary to the Scripture. See if this be not error; the
true Ministers of the Gospel were to take the care of the flock willingly, not
by constraint, but of a ready mind, and not for filthy lucre; neither were they
to be Lords or Rulers over Gods heritage, but they were to be examples to the
Flock, as in 2 Pet. 5.1, 2, 3.

But these are constrained by great Parsonages, Tit. 1.7, 8 1 Timothy 3 1, 2, 3,
4, etc.
and fat Benefices, and are Lords and Rulers over Gods Heritage, being puff't
up in scorn and derision, pride, and ambition, and swell in iniquity,
persecuting, and imprisoning the servants of the Lord, and act contrary to the
Scripture, showing the spirit of error, 1 John 5. (...) As the Priest of
Tharnisworth, when one of his Hear (...) that had been from him a while, and
went to hear him (...) gain, that he might have spoken to that which had n^^
been according to truth; after that he had done, b^^ so soon as he came into
the Idols Temple he ga^^ over his speaking, and sooke to him, and had before
been at his house to bid him come again to he^r him and when he went, the
Priest begun to examine hi^ he being asked a question, made an answer, and f^^
that was he imp^isoned by him, and has lain ^he^e (...) most a year, and does
still continue, for speaking (...) truth as it was made manis^^t to him by the
Lord; b^ing asked the question two or three times before (...) answered: see if
this be not contrary to that Scriptu^^ in 1 Cor. 4. and see if this be not
error; when (...) whole Church were together all might ^peake one (...) one,
that all might be edifyed; and if any thing was ^^vealed to him that sat by,
the first was to hold (...) peace, ^ Cor 14.^3, and 30, ^1, 32, 33.
1 Cor. 14.23.30, 31, 32. but this Priest a^^ contrary to the Scripture, and
shows the spirit of ^^rour.

With the Priest of Tickhill, when one was moved (...) speak in the
Steeple-house, after that he had end^^ his Sermon, he would not stand to
vindicate himself by Scripture, but got him s^t into the stocks. See (...) this
be not Antichrist; where ever. did Christ or (...) true Ministers any such
thing? and when he was (...) in the stocks, many people, scoffing Ishmaels w^^
about him, and the rude multitude; and one w^^ moved to go upon the Cross to
speak to the people and one of those called Church-ward^ns, ^ Act. 4.1, ^^, 3.
(...). 5, 6, 7. and. (...). 17, 18, (...). 20, 21.
threw hi^^ down some 13. steps high, and then the rude peop^^ threw dirt in
his face: see if these do not act the ve^^ same things that the Jews did to
Paul, when they hal^^ him out of the Synagogue, and when they struck P^^ ^^d
Silas, and set them in the stocks, Acts 5.2^* 28. to th^^ 34. Act. 5.40 41, 42.
Act. 6. 10 11, 12, 13 Act. 7.52 53, 54, 55 56, 57. Act. 7 58 59. Acts 14.^^ 2.
and 4, 5. ver. 19. Act 16.1^ 20, 21, 22 23. Gal. 4.29
and threatened ^^ter and John that they should speak no more the ^ame of
Jesus, and stoned some, and imprisoned o^^ers: and now the same things are
acted by those that ^^of^sse themselves to be the people of God, as the Jews
^^id, but they are found to be in the same state and con^^tion that they were,
as their fruits do make manifest. This Priest afterward would not rest till
be had impri^oned the party that spoke to him, and filled a paper ^^f lies, in
a Petition that was rejected. See what fruits ^^ese are; and the people at
Leeds, with the Priests im^risoned others, and at Wakefield both stoned, so
that ^tones flew like bullers in a battle, and slet their dogs, and none
looked to still the rage, not so much as a Towns Clerk. See what fruits these
are, whether of ^^e flesh or spirit, and it will not be denied, but that ^hey
are of the flesh; then what reformation is there ^rought by the Ministers of
the world? for they that ^re in the flesh cannot please God: and so the
Scriptures a^e daily fulfilled; they that are after the flesh, they persecute
them that are after the spirit.

The 2. Priests of Wakefield themselves came by at one time, and when they were
spoken to, they would not stand to prove themselves. See if these be the
Ministers of Christ, or of Antichrist; a good Shepherd lays down his life
for his Sheep. There was one Priest Robbison stood up in the Market at
Wakefield to have maintained himself to have been a Minister of Christ, but
one taking him by the arm, and he, the said Priest, being proved a liar in
the open Market, ran away, and the people set up a shouting: Is this the
Ministry of Christ, or of Antichrist? hold them not up for shame.

The Priest of Fetherston, when one was moved by the Lord to go speak to him,
Acts 13.^^ 14.15. v^^ 50.51.
he caused that before ever he spoke word he should be put in the stocks; and
the Priest when he had done, ^ohn 10.1 8, 9, 12, 13.
one would then have prov^^ him a Thief and a Robber, but he got away.

These Priests, with many more in Yorkshire, whi^^ is too large to express in
writing, the passages of the^^ with the Priests in Lancashire, Westmorland,
Notingha^-shire, Lincolnshire, and Darby-shire, where the Lo^^ has raised up
any to speak against their deceits; (...) would fill up volumnes, but all ends
in persecution, (...) the Jewish Highpriests did, when Jesus Christ ca^^ in
the flesh; so do these now, when Jesus Christ co^^ to be made manifest in the
spiri^s of his people, to test^fie against their deceits, wherein they have
been dece^ved by them, that others may not be led to destructi^^ by them; For
the leaders of the people cause them to en^ Isaiah 3.12. Isaiah 9.16. And if
the blind lead (...) blind, they shall both fall into the ditch, Math^^
15.14.

All people, take wa^ning betime, and hold them (...) up, but come out of their
dark Ministry, which is S^^dome and Egypt, where the Lord is crucified; they
a^^ committing spiritual wickedness in high places, bo^^ Priests and People;
Hos. 4 9. Rev. 18.4, ^, 6, 7, 8.
like Priests, like People, Hos. 4.^ Thus says the Lord, Come out of B^b^^^^
my people (...) ye be partakers of her plagues: come out of the Ido^^ Temple,
and out of the Idols Worship; come out of Bab^lon with n in your hearts, and
touch no unclean thing, a^^ the Lord will receive you, ^ Cor. 6.^ 6, 17, 18.
2 Cor. 6.16, 17, 18.

The Highpriests were ever the greatest enemies (...) Jesus Christ, and they
are yet alive to persecute him (...) where he is made manifest in the spirits
of his peopl^^ Christ is the same yesterday, Heb 13.8. Mat. 2.5.
to day, and for ever, Heb* 1^ 8. The Chief Priests a^e the same that they
were, (...) they did then, they show the same deed: now; see th^^ Chief
Priests first begun to join persecution wi^^ Herod against Christ, when he was
borne. See Math. ^^ 5. to the 16. see Mat. 16.21. The Chief Priests we^^ sore
displeased at him, Mat. 21.15, 16. The Chief Priests and Elders came to
question his authority, ver. 23. Mat. 20.18, 19. The Chief Priests condemned
him, and delivered him to the Gentiles, to mock him, Mat. 2 18, 19* Mat. 2 14,
15* ver. 47
and scourge him: The Chief Priests covenanted with Judas to betray Christ,
Mat. 26.14, 15. A great multitude came with Judas from the Chief Priests, with
swords and staves to take Jesus, ver. 47. and Jesus was led to the High Priest,
where the Scribes and Elders were assembled, ver. 57. The Chief Priests and
Elders, ver. 57
and all the Council sought false witness against Jesus to put him to death,
ver. 59 to the
ver. 59. at last came two false witnesses, then the Chief Priests adjured him
to speak, and when he spoke the truth, the Chief Priest rent his clothes, and
said he spoke blasphemy, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65. truth is blasphemy to the deceit;
when Jesus was condemned to dye by the Chief Priests, Rulers, and Elders of
the people, they spit in his Face, and smote him on the Cheek, and buffeted
him, ver. 66, 67. Mat. 2 66, 67.
And thus the Serpent spued out his venom then against the truth; and the
Jews, Chief Priests, and Elders are alive yet, to persecute Christ in his
Members. This is the same generation of Cain that persecutes, a seed of evil
doers: see if these do not deny the Scriptures, and show the spirit of error,
and cannot make good their call, but ran and the Lord never sent them, and have
nothing but what they have studied out of Books, and Studies; and the Hireling
flees because he is an Hireling, that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, John
10.13.

John Cart, the Priest of Hanseworth, when one was moved by the Lord to speak
to him, he caused him to be taken prisoner; and so they all act in the same
state and condition that the Jewish Highpriests did, and are enemies both to
Jesus Christ and His; for inasmuch as they do it to one of his, they do it to
him, and make their refuge to the Popes Law, that wa^ made to uphold the Popish
Clergy by, when they di^ uphold the Mass made by Queen Mary; see the Statute
in the first of Mary, 2. Ass. 3. Ch: and again see i^ it be not repealed by
Elizabeth, in the first year of he^ reign, 2. Chapter last clause. See Coke. pla.
fol. 352. Si^ Nich. Hides Chief Justice then in England cited, tha^ it was
wholly repealed by that of Elizabeth, in the first year of her reign, 2.
chap. last clause: see Dalton, 103.104. page See if these be the Ministers of
Christ, or of Antichrist, that make their refuge to the Popes Law to imprison
by; neither Jesus Christ nor his true Ministers did ever so. Let truth come to
light, and deceits and deceivers put to shame; (...). 33.22.
God is judge, Lawgiver, and King.

The said Priest, John Cart, he dealt deceitfully, just as Pilat did with
Christ, who said he would wash his hands in Innocence, for, said he, I will
forgive him, but Officers, says he, look you to your office. Pilat and Herod
both join together to persecute Christ in his Saints; many friends went up to
have spoken with this Priest afterward, but he would neither come at them, nor
suffer them to come at him, those which had been the chief hearers: see if the
deceits be not afraid to come to light, for truth seeks no corners; therefore
love that which is good, and hate that which is evil, every one, and prove
your own work: so shall you have joy in your selves and not in others, ^al.
6.4.
Gal. 6.4. prove all things, and hold fast that which is good, but cease from
all your Priests, deceivers, blind guides, Hirelings, ^^r. 23.1, 2
Seducers, and Antichrists, they shall never profit you at all; they ran but
the Lord never sent them, hold them not up, the Lord is against them, Ier.
23.30, 31, 32.

The Priest of Doncaster, he imprisoned one for asking him a question, and when
he was before the Major and Justices to be examined, the Priest fled into the
further corner of the house, as one James Nayler spoke to him, and the Priest
did confess there openly, that he had not attained to that which the party
imprisoned by him had done, and desired the prisoner to pray for him; yet
nothing will serve but imprisonment. See if this be not Antichrist, hold them
not up, down with them all, they are all fallen backward, and gone out of the
way of obedience, and selfe-denyall; but they must be called to account before
the righteous Judge, the Lord of Heaven and Earth, that they may have their
trial: thus says the Lord, Woe to the wicked, it shall be ill with them, and
they shall be rewarded according to their doings, Isa. 3.10.

The wicked shall be turned into Hell, and all those that forget God, and have
their portion in the lake that burns. The Lord is sending forth his Angels to
gather out of his Kingdom all things that offend; then shall the righteous
shine forth in brightness, in the Kingdom of their Father.

The vials are pouring forth, Rev. 18 7, 8, 9.
and the beast begins to roar, the Lord is Judge himself, and he will plague
the Beast, and burn the Whore, and torment the wicked for evermore.

Both Gog and Magog is gathering to battle, as the number of the sand of the
Sea, going on the breadth of the earth, to compass the Camp of the Saints
about, and the beloved City, and fire will fall down from God out of Heaven
and devour them, Revelations 20.8, 9, etc.

Blessed and holy is he that has part in the first Resurrection, on such the
second death has no power, but they shall be Priests of God, and of Christ,
and shall reign with him a thousand years. Rev. 20.6.

This was written by a Thresher, that goes about with his threshing
Instrument, laboring where he finds work.

Arise Sion and thresh with a new threshing Instrument, ^sa. 41.14, ^5. ^lie.
4.13.
having Teeth.

Thus says the Lord, Hearken unto me y^ stout-hearted that are far from
righteousness. I bring near my righteousness, it shall not be for off, and
my salvation it shall not tarry, and I wi^^ place salvation in Sion for Israel
my glory* Isaiah 46.12, 13.

FINIS.
The Difference between the Ordinance of Christ and of Antichrist.
TAke heed of despising the Ordinance of Jesus Christ, who has left it upon
record, and also wri^eth it in the new Law of Righteousness, in the hearts ^f
his people, saying, Heb. 8.10 11. Jer. 31.31 32, 33, 34 Joh. 14.1 Col. 3.4,
Joh. 8.44 Colos. 3.2, 3. Romans 8.^ Phil. 3.1 19. Luke 12 29, 30, 3 1 Cor. 1 19.
1 Cor. 1 17, 18.
If ye love me keep my Commande^ents: I. love God with all your hearts, 2.
forsake your ^^sts and vile affections in affecting earthly things, that ^s the
Devils Ordinance, says Jesus Christ, set not your ^ffections on things which
are on the earth, but set your affe^tions on things in the heavens; that is the
Ordinance of Christ: for sake your carthly mintlednesse, for that is ^he Devils
Ordinance; to be carnally minded is death, and the carnal mind is enmity to
the Cross of Christ; Christ says, Seek first the Kingdom of God, and his
^ighteousnesse, and all things else shall be added; and love thy Neighbor as
thy self, and do unto all men as ye would be done by, and feed the hungry,
and cloth the naked, and let the oppressed go free, and deny thy self of thy
own wisdom, and selfe-righteousness and conceitednesse, and heady
high-mindednesse, and thy self-love, and the honor of the would; and forsake
all vain delights, and vain pleasures, and take up a daily Cross to thy own
will and follow me, and learn of me, for I am meek, and lowly in heart; and so
shall you find rest to your souls, following through the straight way of
obedience and selfe-denyall. These things with many other, thou shall find
commanded to be done by the new Law of Righteousness in thy heart; leave them
not undone, Christ does require it of thee, it is his Ordinance.

The Priests of the world are carnal and earthly minded, coveting after great
Benefices, swallowing up the earth like Bell, and the Dragon, never have
enough, belly, gods, that do consume and devour the Creation upon their
lusts, ^^il. 3.^^, 19.
pride, pleasures, and heady high-mindednesse, living in lust and excess;
oppressors they are, oppressing the poor people, and persecuting the servants
of the Lord; ^^il. 3.20.
the true Ministers had their conversation in Heaven, as in Phil. 3.20. and
they did exhort others to follow their example, and to mark those that did not
follow them in life and conversation, Phil. 3.17. but these walk contrary to
them, ^^se 27.
and have lost their example; herein they walk contrary to the Scripture and
shows the spirit of error. The Priests of the world do persecute and
imprison, as the Jewish Highpriests did imprison the Apostles, which were the
true Ministers of Christ, who were blameless in their lives and conversations,
and did walk blamlesly, giving no offen^^ in any thing, that their ministry
might not be blamed; but in all things did approve themselves as the Ministers
of Christ, in much patience, afflictions, in necessities, in imprisonments, in
tumults, in watchings, in fastings, etc. 2 Cor. 6.3, 4, 5. But these are
contrary that do imprison others, Cor. 6.3 5.
and consume the creatures of God upon their lusts, living in pride and
excess, and by their cold, dark, barren Ministry, stadve the souls and
bodies o^ others, and walk contrary to the Scriptures, as in thi^ of 2 Cor.
6.3, 4, 5. etc. and that of Tit. 1.7, 8. and 1 Timothy 3.1, 2, 3. etc. and that of
2 Pet. 5.1, 2, 3. The Ministers of Christ are to take care of the flock
willingly, Tim. 3.2, 3, 4. Pet. 5.2, 3.
of a ready mind, not by constraint, nor for filthy luere, not to be Lords
over Gods heritage; but the Priests of th^^ world are constrained by fat
Benefices and great Parsonages; and if they can but have 10, or 20 l. mo^e^
year in another place, it will constrain them to lea^^ them where they are to
go to that: see if they do no^ act contrary to these Scriptures, and are
guided by the spirit of error, 1 John 4.5, 6.
1 John 4.5, 6. The Ministers of Jesus Christ were to be gentle toward all
men, even to those that did oppose themselves, and were not to be Lords and
Rulers over Gods beritage, but these are, and just act all those things that
are forbidden: 2 Pet. 5,
that which they should not be that they are, that which they should be that
they are not, and have lost their examples in all things: see if this be not
Antichrist; who deny the Scripture but the Priests of the world? and who cry
out of error more then they? but now they are found out, they cry as the
Thief does, that says, turn Thief, turn Thief, that he he may not be looked
at, but sets the people to look out at some others, and not at him: and see if
the Priests do not so; look well to them, they can deceive none now, but
blind-men, and fools, that gaze abroad, for wise men's eyes are in their heads,
in Christ that does enlighten them, and so shows them their deceits; they that
walk contrary to the Scriptures are to be noted, that they may be put to shame,
2 These. 5, 6. 1 Timothy, 9.10. Isa. 9.1
2 These. 2. Now Priests be ashamed of the evil of your doings, that take the
Scriptures to talk of, and make a trade of them for money, which is your Diana,
and walk contrary to them: but it is fulfilled, the leaders of the people
cause them to err, Isa. 9.16. Blush for shame, and give over deceiving of the
people. The Priests in the first Covenant were to live of the sacrifices that
were offered up, which a people brought in freely, Rev. 1.6, 7. 1 Cor. 10, 11,
13. 1 Cor. 14, 15. Gal. 1.12.
and had no other ways: they were to wait upon that Ministry, and they
sacrificing and waiting at the Altar, taking of the things sacrificed and
offered up, was a type or figure, that they that preach the Gospel should live
on the Gospel, and be set apart wholly for that work. Now the Gospel is
spiritual, and not carnal, and: the carnal man knows it not, because he
does not understand the things of God, who is a spirit, and the Gospel is
spiritual and none can preach that everlasting Gospel but Jesus Christ who
lives in our bodies, ^l. 1.15, Cor. 3.^.6. Cor. 6.^.
that are made the temples of the Holy Ghost, and he preaches to the spirits
that are in prison, and he does it freely, it is his delight to do his Fathers
will, killing all our lusts, that were sacrificed too when we lived in the lust
of the flesh, and he crucifieth them, and works us out of our selves into the
divine nature, Cor. 6.17, 18. or. 13.5 l. 1.17. b. 7.24.
and his life is in doing us good, being his Fathers will, offering up our
requests to the Father in us, and for us, that he by his own blood, the spirit
of life in us, killing, slaying, and crucifying the corrupt nature in us, and
working out that which is evil, being made manifest in us to destroy the
works of the Devil, ^h. 2.4, ^^, 7 ^^oh. 3.7,
taking our minds and affections into that which is eternal and invisible,
working us into that which is pure and spiritual, that we may praise and
glo^ify his great and glorious name, being made partakers of his divine nature
f^e^ly for his names sake, ^^^h. 2.13,^^.
and not for any deserts in us, and being brought out of darkness into his
mavelous light by the guidance of the eternal spirit in us, ^^^h. 3.17, etc.
^^m. 8.10
leading us out of bondage into liberty, sending the spirit of his Son into our
hearts crying Abba Father, which none can do but those that are born again,
^^m. 14.16, 17, 18 v. 3.12.49.8. or. 12.
having their Fathers name given them at the entrance into the new Covenant,
which is inwardly, to the Jews inwardly, the seed of Abraham after the spirit,
being baptized by the free spirit into that spiritual body: all that are born
again are redeemed from their vain conversation to serve the Lord in newness
of spirit in walking humbly before him, ^et. 1.23. ^oh. 3.1, (...), 45.^. 9. h.
5.11.
being borne again of water and the spirit of the family of Abraham the Father
of the faithful; we are set apart to testify against all unfaithfulness, for
faith works by love, and causes love to run forth to others, to all
creatures, even to enemies; and so the Gospel comes to be preached to every
creature in living in love with one another, even Jesus Christ, which is the
Son of his love, 2 Cor. 4 10, 11. Ephesians. 2.1, Ezekiel. 37.13, 14. Ezekiel. 37.23, 24, 2
etc.
having his treasure in earthly vessels: God manifesting him. ^else in our
flesh, and dwelling in us, taking away our ^ony hearts which was the cause of
oppression, which ^aused the creation in us to groan under the burden of
^ppression by reason of that cursed nature which did ^ear rule over the pure
seed in us, which now the Lord ^f his infinite mercy has delivered us from by
the powerful operation of his spirit in us, changing our vile ^ffections that
were set altogether on earth and earthly ^elights and vanities, and so ran
after covetousness, 1 John 4.^ 1 Ioh. 3.2 Ezekiel. 36 25.26, 2 28.
and ^o satisfy the earthly lusts did oppress and burden others; but the Lord
by the power of the eternal spirit in ^s, the divine operation has wrought
out our corrupt ^atures, and engrafted us into the divine nature, being the
workmanship of God, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, John 17 6, 7, 8,
9^.10. Ioh. 14.2 Ioh. 15.^ 10, 11, 1 13, 14.
which is the fruits and effects of the spirit of God that wrought faith in our
hearts, giving us new hearts, do^ng good to all, even to enemies; for faith
works by love, which love is Jesus Christ the Son of God, who preaches ^he
Gospel of ^is Fathers love in us that we may be what we do profess, not loving
in word and in tongue, ^s the world does, that lives in dissimulation, but in
^^eed and in truth; for he that says he loves God and ^ates his Brother, is a
Liar, and the truth is not in him; 1 John 20. Ephesians. 5.1 Isa. 58.1
but truth dwelling in us, which is Jesus Christ the ^ower of God that has
reformed and changed our na^ures and dispositions, and has put in our hearts
to execute, to do his will, which is to tessify against all de^eits and
oppressions, Isa. 28.1, Isa. 30.1
that are covered under a cloak of ^rofession, and no true love but lust, both
to pride and ^ovetousnesse, anger and envy, lying and swearing, ^runkenness,
oppression, Mic. 2.1 2, 3,
and grinding the faces of the ^oore, living in lust and excess; ye live in
pleasures and wantonness upon earth, ye the proud Priests, Iam. 5.5.
and ^ovetous professors, and heady highminded ones that fare sumptuously, ^el
3.11. ^al. 24.1. ^ Cor. 10.
feeding upon your dainty dish^^ Dives like, and gri^ding the poor to powder
in taxa^^ons and oppressions; you that have got a great deal (...) the earth
into your hands, which is the Lords, and (...) provides largely for every
creature, but that proud D^vill that rules in your proud flesh, does oppress
and gri^^ the poor to pieces: ^^a. 3.15. ^^icah 3.^ 2, 3.
Thus says the Lord, What me^^ ye to beat my people in pieces, and grind the
faces of the poo^^ Dives fares sumptuously, and poor Lazarus is in wa^^ the

ye p^oud and lustful ones; if ye did but kn^^ him ye would keep his

the oppressed might go free; you consu^^ mo^e upon your lusts, pride, and

less, and practice m^^ you are wise to do evil, Priests and People, but to
(...) good have no understanding; cease to do evil, a^^ learn to do well: did
you but know Christ you wo^^ not suffer him to want in his Members, ^sa. 1.17.

you would (...) imprison him to satisfy your lusts; and you that p^^fessse to

girls, that k^^ not their right hands from their left, to put their ha^^ to
your Petitions, as the Priest of Sheffield and others (...) cry as ^he Jews
did, Crucify him, Crucify him, wh^^ he is made manifest in spirit, and cries
for Barabba^^ ^e at liberty, that your lusts may be fed; ye lustful ones, Isa.
51.2 22, 23. Isa. 52.
Christ is risen, and is arising in the hearts of his people ^o testify
against all deceits and deceivers: repent, and ^ive over deceiving the people,
now whilst you have ^ime, lest his judgments come upon you and destroy ^ou
with a sore destruction: Iam. 5.1 3, 4, 5, 6
the Lord is now looking ^or fruits* and here is nothing brought forth by the
highest profession but wild grapes, as pride, and oppression, and grinding the
faces of the poor; be not deceived, Gal. 6.^ Ia. 4.2, ^
God is not mocked, for such as ye sow such ye shall reap; they that sow to the
flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption; and see whether there be any other
fruits brought forth by the Ministry of the world, but fruits of the flesh,
yea or no; Is not pride a fruit of the flesh? Yes, it is one of the seven
abominations that the Lord loatheth, Prove. 6.16, 17, 18. and does it not swell
in England, Isa. 3.5 Mal. 3 Iam. ^
both in Priests, their Wives, and Lawyers? all swell in pride which is an
abomination to the Lord, and cry out of those that are brought to deny
themselves of it, and walk in humbleness of heart, and lowliness of mind, and
proud men say those deny the Ordinance of Christ; but let me ask thee one
question, Iam. ^ Mat. ^
Whether is pride an Ordinance of God, or an Ordinance of the Devil? It pride
be of the Devil, then thou that live in pride and haughtiness, thou obeyest
the Devils command, and disobeyest the command of Jesus Christ, who says,
learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart; Pro. ^ Isa. 2 ^ Jer. ^ v. 14 ^
Isa. ^ ^
pride goes before destruction; woe to it, woe to it. The Land mourns by
reason of pride, both in Gentry and Clergy; the Lord will cut down the
fruitless Tree that cumbers the ground: some swe^l in pride, and others go in
nakedness and wants; then thou proud professing Pharisee, how do thou obey
God and walk in his commands, when thou swellest with pride, and let
others starve for want? when as Jesus Christ says, Man ^ 45.
love thy Neighbor as thy self: and again, he that says he loves God and
keeps not his Commandments is a ly^^ and the truth is not in him; Ioh. 2.4,
6.
and he that says he is in Christ ought to walk as he wilked. Now read the
Scripture (...) and see if Jesus Christ was proud, but on the contra^^ forbids
it, ^^t. 17. ^ 20. (...) 25.41 ^^ 33, etc
and threatne^h woes to it: howl thou prou^ and lofty one, thou art a
fruitless tree, and cumbers the ground, thou must be cut down and cast into the
fire o^ the indignation of the Lord, and the Ordinance tha^ thou talkest so
much of will not save thee; it is not he^^ that says Lord, ^^t. 7.21.
Lord, that shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, ^^h. 3.17
but he that does the will of God (...) Now his will is, that thou should do
to all men as thou would be done by; (...). 5.20.
if ^hou would have the Lord to do good to thee, then thou must do good to
others, for he that has this worlds good, and sees his Brother stand in need,
(...). 2^.^ 7.^ 21.19
and shut ^eth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwells the love of
God in him? Talk no more of thy O^dinances, exc^pt thou walk in them, walk
in the ways of Jesus Christ who went about doing good, thou savest well, but
thou do contrary, thou dissembling Hypocrite, the Lord knows thy hypocrisy
and dissimulation; all thy profession is as the cursed fig tree that brings
forth no fruit, but leaves: here are fair words, but foul actions, nothing
but fruits of the flesh, and they that are in the flesh cannot please God, Romans
8 8. See then what fruits grow on the great tree ^n England, the flourishing
tree of profession, is it not now read for the fire? does it bring forth any
thing but cumbers the ground? is not pride the top branch of it? and
covetousness bears a great sway: there is much of that fruit grows out of
it; (...). 15.
and see if this be the O^dinance of Christ or of Antichrist* thou blind
Pharisee, (...), 29 ^3
thy eyes are stopped with dirt, daubed with pride, and the D vill he is King,
and rules in thy heart, and thou cryest out of denying the O^dinance: thou that
live in pride and covetousness, where art thou got? ^^to the Kingdom of
Antichrist, but woe is coming, Ephesians. 5.3, 4, 5, 6. Luc. 12.1^ Luc. 16. 1^ 14,
15. Hab. 2.^ Psalm. 9.8. Psa. 10.3^ Psalm. 7.1^ 12. Isa. 56.1 16.
^^vertousnesse is the root of all evil, and there is great ^^re of this fruit
