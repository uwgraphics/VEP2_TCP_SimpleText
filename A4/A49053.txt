By the Mayor.

To every Minister within the City of London, Liberties, Line of Communication,
and Bills of Mortality.
THe extraordinary blessing of God upon the Forces under the Command of Sir
William Waller, and Sir William Belfour, against the Army led by Sir Ralph
Hopton, for the destruction of the Parliament, this City and Kingdom, in a
Battle near Winchester, yesterday being Friday, the 29 of March instant,
which continued from eight a clock in the morning until night, wherein the
enemy was absolutely routed, and pursued many miles with good execution, being
signified unto me by the most Honorable Committee of both Kingdoms, requires
a more solemn Thankesgiving then upon so short warning can be performed;
especially considering that this mercy has been beyond expectation cast in
from heaven into our bosoms so soon after our late Fasting and humiliation
after that sad blow about Newark; I do heartily (according to the order of the
said Committee of both Kingdoms,) desire and require you to morrow, being the
Lords Day, to give notice of this goodness, to your Congregation, using your
best endeavors to quicken them to the highest pitch of thankfulness to the God
of our Mercies, and to engage their hearts and hands yet further, To help the
Lord against the Mighty, with their prayers and all others, helps of Money,
Arms, Horse, Men, or other provisions for the instant, making up and supplying
of a body of Horse and Foot to go out and follow the enemy, to prevent the
rallying of his men, or raising of new Forces to do further mischief, that
God may give a speedy end to the present Calamities, and restore a stable Peace
in this afflicted Nation, to the comfort of all Gods people in all the
Kingdoms.

And what God shall move the hearts of men to subscribe and contribute, or what
men they shall send out or maintain, to this most necessary service, not only
my self, but the Committee of the Militia, do make it our joint request that
you, with some others well affected, would set down in writing, and return upon
Monday morning next without fail, to the Committee of the Militia at Guildhall.

Dated this 30 of March, Anno Dom. 1644. John Wollaston, Mayor.
