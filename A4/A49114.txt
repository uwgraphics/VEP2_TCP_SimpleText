THE DEDICATION.
Blessed Savior,
WHo have put into the heart of thy meanest Servant to vindicate one of the
highest Ordinances, and have in some measure given him strength to bring forth
what thou gave him grace to conceive: Pardon (I humbly beseech thee) the
weakness of these endeavors, and prosper them by thy Almighty Spirit, to the
reviving of thine own despised Institution. Thou have the hearts of all men in
thy hand; remove, I pray thee, all ignorance and prejudice, all pride and
partiality, all carnal interests, and inordinate passions from their hearts,
into whose hands these unworthy labors shall come; and cause them, and the
daily prayers of thy Servant, to become effectual through thy blessing, for
the production of that good end to which it is intended: And let the Power and
the Praise be only thine, who bring greatest things to pass by the weakest
means, and out of the mouths of babes and sucklings do ordinarily perfect thy
praise. Suffer not (blessed Lord) the spirit of error and division to prevail
against those whom thou have purchased with thy blood; but let that blood be
effectually applied unto them, to cleanse them from their sins, to confirm them
in thy truth, and to cement them inseparably in brotherly love and unity: That
as we have One Lord, one Faith, and one Baptism, so we may be all of one heart
and of one mind in all things that concern the purity of thy worship, the peace
and edification of thy Church, and may have all our requests, together with the
Incense of thy Almighty Intercession, daily presented unto our heavenly Father,
in that golden Censer which thou (in great mercy to our infirmities) have
consecrated for the offering up of the prayers of thy Servants; commanding us
when we pray, to say, Our Father, etc.

To the Worshipful, JOHN MAYNARD ESQUIRE, Sergeant at Law.
Honored Sir,
I Have made my Dedication, laying down my self, and all my poor endeavors, at
the feet of Jesus Christ, my great Master: And having paid my vows, I come
now to pay my debts, or rather (because they are greater then I can satisfy)
to make my acknowledgement, presenting this Pepper-corn to your hand. All the
hope that I have of your acceptance, is, because I have entitled you to a
righteous cause, and such as can plead for it self. No eminency of learning or
authority can give any opponent so great advantage against him that pleads
the cause of Christ, is the truth and goodness of that cause can administer to
him that defends it against all opposers, be they never so numerous, or
clamorous: And yet (Worthy Sir) lest the weakness of the Advocate should seem
to prejudice the cause, I have chosen to plead it mostly in the Language, and
Arguments of men, as famous for excellent learning and exemplary Piety, as any
this Age can boast of; And I am sure too, that there are many Persons alive of
that Character, who will readily appear and plead for it still: but if all
should forsake it, if all should oppose it, Our great Master can plead his own
Cause, and I doubt nor Sir, but you will be of his Council; and then though the
Solicitor be an Ignoramus, yet there is no fear of the Verdict.

And thus having done my devoir, and told the world that no man on Earth has
better Title to my Labors then your self, I beseech the God of Heaven to make
you as eminent in Spiritual, as you are in Temporal blessings, that the inner
man may prosper as the outward does. So prays

Your Servant in all good Offices, THO. LONG.

The Preface.
WHile our generation has been so busy in casting out the rubbish of the
Sanctuary, it should have been the special care and inspection of the public
Servants of God attending holy things, that none of the sacred vessels and
utensils of that house, which (...).
had Holiness to the Lord written on them, were thrown out: But the enemy
having prevailed with too many to lay aside some as vessels, and to trample on
others as outworn beggarly implements, has also raised so much dust, as has
buried many, and sullied the glory of all the rest; yea, and (as if the
Christian Church had its cloud too) the understandings of the beholders are so
darkened, that it is become as difficult to discern, and separate between the
precious and the vile, as it is easy and familiar to call evil good, and good
evil. In this great confusion, wherein Jerusalem has been made an heap, that
Golden Censer wherein the Prayers of the Saints were wont to be offered up to
the God of Heaven, and that which has been used in all ages as the Sal omnium
Divinorum officiorum.
Salt to season all Christian services, has it self been hudled up as useless,
or cast out as unsavory. And no wonder; for when the enemy opposes no
Ordinance more then Prayer, and of all Prayers this of our Lord is incomparably
the most excellent, of which we may justly say (as the People did of David)
Thou 1 Kings 22. 31.
art worth ten thousand of others; we may not think it strange, if (as the King
of Syria did) he so order it, that his Instruments fight not against small or
great, but only this King of Prayers. And indeed fought they have against it
many a time, since Pelagius first blew the trumpet, and marshalled his forces
against this and other important truths of Christ; but never were they so
unhappily succesful as in our generation. That the professed enemies of
Jerusalem should cry, raze her, raze her, even to the ground, is a Psalm 137. 7.
voice that the Church has been acquainted with in all ages; that they should
assault her foundations, and trample upon all the holy Ordinances, disannul the
Office, and despise the persons of the Ministry, call their Prayers charms,
and their Preaching foolishness, is so far from wonder, that it would be a
great wonder if they should not; but that they who are named by the name of
Christ should do these iniquities, that his veterane Soldiers, and
houshold-servants, who yet remain in his Tents, should conspire with his
enemies to betray his foretresses, cast away their arms, and desert Preces and
lachrymae arma Ecclesia.
his cause, is of very sad consideration: Such practices as these have weakened
the cause of Christ, and given great advantage to the adversary; yea, and a
just ground of scandal is hereby offered to all sober Christians, both at home
and abroad, against the Persons and Prayers of the Ministry of England, that
we have been so negligent in asserting the frequent use of Our Lords Prayer,
(of which the most are guilty,) or contrary to their former practice (which it
is hoped they performed in Faith) have wholly abandoned the use of it (as too
many;) and what is worst of all, that any Disciple, after Confession of its
excellency, and crying Hosanna to it, should almost in the same breath denounce
a crucifigite, that with its blessed Maker it might be betrayed with a kiss.

When an Enemy, when the Sea invadeth our Land, and threatens destruction, we
all join as one man to make up the breaches; but when our Religion, our Zion,
is assaulted by more Enemies then ever, when her Turrets and Battlements are
broken down, no man lays it to heart: This is Zion whom no man seeks after,
was her Motto of old, Ier. 30. 17. How secure and negligent have we been for
the most part, disserviceable and injurious to the Cause of Christ and his
Church, against the unchristian reasonings, and unreasonable practices of such
men, who would drive us from our last and best refuge, (Quid enim nisi vota?
for what can Christians better confide in then in their Prayers; and what
Prayer is like to be more safe and effectual then this?) I shall expose my
self, not animated with the expectation of success and victory, (being on the
defensive part) but to discharge my duty, to show my readiness in the cause of
Christ, and to strengthen the feeble knees, and lift up the hands that hang
Hebr. 12. 12.
down, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way: And yet seeing that
Magna est veritas, and praevalebit, truth is great and will prevail, (though
the Advocate that pleads for it be never so weak;) and seeing that no truth
has more express foundation in Scripture, or for that cause has had more
universal practice in the Church, I despair not but the eyes of those that are
not wilfully blind may be opened, at least the mouths of such as are not
desperately wicked may be stopped from reproching the footsteps of Gods
anointing, in decrying the pious use of this most excellent Prayer, by that
which (through the blessing of God) shall be said on its behalf in this
ensuing Exercitation. Which that it may not swell with a (...), or digression,
I shall insert a few things by way of Introduction against the opinion of such
as oppose this Prayer under the notion of being a form; as 1. that though some
forms may justly be disliked, yet the ground of disliking them because they are
forms, is very unjust; forasmuch as God himself prescribed diverse forms, which
were accordingly practiced by the Jewish Church under the Law: and our Savior,
and the Christian Church after his Example have in all ages done the like under
the Gospel; Most unhappy therefore are they who heap such disrespect on that
most Heavenly Prayer, delivered and inculcated by our Savior once and again to
his Disciples, merely on the account of its being a form; in as much as they
seem to fight against God, and proclaim that to be common and unclean which God
and our Savior have Sanctified by their reiterated injunction and practice.

And with what greater pomp the Friends of the English Liturgy could have
solemnized its funerals, then the enemies of it have done, in causing this
sacred form to accompany it to its grave, no Master of Ceremonies could well
have contrived. In condemning this they have (as much as in them lay) justified
that, and given its friends some hope (there being so much Divinity in the
Grave with it) that one day it may have a refined resurrection.

But at such a Funeral as this the Church cannot but mourn in the words of old
Jacob; Joseph is not, and Simeon Genesis 42. 36.
is not, and will ye take Benjamin away? all these things are against me. But
that in the Old Testament diverse forms were prescribed by God, and used by the
Jews, sundry instances will evince.

That of Alsteed shall lead the Chorus; Theol. Catech. p. 683
Etsi in S S. nihil tradatur de formula precum, Although nothing be recorded in
Scripture concerning a form of Prayer used by the Fathers before the flood,
(for that which the Jews say of certain Psalms then used, is uncertain) yet
sure it is that they had a set form of Prayer, because they had a set form of
worshipping God, i. e. certain Rites, Ceremonies, and Sacrifices (for the
worship of God without Genesis 4. 3. 4.
Prayer is imperfect,) and God was then invocated.

To this, that they had a certain sort of Jude 14.
Books wherein it is likly such forms were recorded: But after the flood, before
the promulgation of the Law, there were extant the devout Prayers of Abraham,
Jacob, and Moses. Moreover, Genesis 18. 27. Genesis 32. 9. Exodus 34. 8. Numb. 6. 24.
when God delivered the Law of the Nazarites, he enjoined Aaron and his Sons a
form of Prayer, which others afterward did imitate. Thus far Alsteed. And I
find his first conjecture to be approved by many learned men, viz. that
Sacrifice was always attended with solemn invocation; which appears from Genesis
12. 8. Abraham built an Altar, and called upon the Name of the Lord: and from
Psalm 116. verse 13, 17. I will take the cup of salvation, and will call upon
the Name of the Lord. I will offer to thee the sacrifice of Thankesgiving, and
will call upon the name of the Lord.

Sigonius says, that from the time of Sigonius de Repub. Hebraeorum. p. 151
their settlement in Canaan, the Jews had, In omnibus urbibus loca quaedam
destinata precibus solennibus, certain places set apart in every City for
solemn Prayers; so that Prayers (it seems) were more usual then Sacrifice:
and thus Bertram; Conveniebat populus ad Synagogas De Politia Judaica p. 96.
and 131.
extra Jerusalem ad preces solennes; the people met in certain Synagogues
without Jerusalem for solemn Prayer: but now (as Dr. Lightfoot notes) they
Miscell. p. 44.
are content (as appears in their Common Prayer Book, and they pray God to be
so too) with Prayers without Sacrifices. The Jews have a form of Prayer
recorded which (they say) was used by Noah; how truly, I will not contend: but
these following instances of prescribed forms so used are undoubtedly true; as
the blessing enjoined Aaron and his Numb. 6. 24.
sons was constantly pronounced, and continued until the days of Simeon the
Pet^. Gaclat. p. 85.
Just, who embraced Christ in his arms. The Song of Moses, Exodus 15. 1. was
used on all occasions of Thanksgiving by Deuteronomy. 26. 13.
that Church. The form enjoined at the end of tithing on the third year. Paulus
Fagius gives us the form of Prayer used by Aaron over the Scapegoat, Quae
forma haec fuit, which form was this; O Levit. 16. 21.
Lord, thy people the children of Israel have sinned, they have done wickedly,
they have grievously transgressed against thee; I beseech thee now O Lord
forgive their sins, iniquities and transgressions wherein, thy people the
children of Israel have sinned, and done wickedly, and transgressed against
thee. And another form when the bullock was offered, v. 27. And he gives a
third form on chapter 8. and adds, (...) simile est Christum quibusdam quae in
his precibus continentur usum fuisse, It is likely that Christ made use of some
things in these prayers; but of this hereafter.

Hoernebeck repeating the seven precepts Deconvert. and convincend. Judaeis. p.
447.
of Noah, viz. 1. For avoiding Idolatry, 2. Not cursing of God, 3. Not shedding
of blood, 4. Not discovering of nakedness, or fornication, 5. Of theft and
rapine, 6. Of Judgment, 7. Of not eating any part of a living creature: all
which the Jews say were given by Noah, and so continued till Abraham, who
received a precept for circumcision, and appointed Morning-prayer: Isaac
consecrated Tithes, and added another prayer to be said before day: Jacob added
another precept, De non comedendo nervo oblivioso, of not eating the nerve of
forgetfulness, and prayers for the Evening, and at length by Moses was the Law
consummate. Mr. Herbert Thornedike proves the use of forms from 1 Chronicles. 23.
30. where the Levites were to bless Of the service of God, p. 2 9.
and praise the God of Israel, using some Psalms of David, particularly those
Psalms of Degrees from Psalm 121. to Car. Sigonius de Repub. Hebr. p. 243.
Psalm 135. which being ended, they pronounced the blessing appointed in the
Law. And indeed the Titles of those Psalms, directed, for the Masters of
Music, do intimate that they were to be used in the service of the Temple; and
learned men also assure us, they were constantly so used: many of David's
Psalms were used as the Jewish Liturgy on all occasions; Psalm 104, 105, 106,
107. were of frequent use, Psalm 92. was appointed for the Sabbath, Psalm 118.
for Festivals, Psalm 102. for the afflicted.

Saint Hierome observes, that four of Psalm. 17. 86. 142. Case of Conscience.
them are expressly called Prayers. Mr. Perkins says, that most of them are so,
Psalm 90. is called A Prayer of Moses the man of God; which because Scripture
says it, we ought to believe it was so, Hezekiah, we read, commanded the
Levites 2 Chronicles. 29. 30.
to praise God in the words of David and Asaph; and that he had a form of
thanksgiving which he used all the days of his life is very probable from Isa.
38. 20. for it was appointed for the House of the Lord. Calvin says, Consilium
Spiritus On Ps. 20.
Sancti (meo judicio) fuit ordinariam precandi formam Ecclesiae tradere, cujus
usum ex verbis fuisse colligimus, quoties discrimen aliquod instabat: It was
the counsel of the Spirit of God to give his Church an ordinary form of Prayer,
which was used in words, as often as any danger approached.

In a Samaritan Chronicle, which the renowned Archbishop of Armagh procured
from the Library of the admirably learned Joseph Scaliger, is another testimony
of the Antiquity of forms; Postea mortuus est Adrianus, etc. After this died
Adrian, in whose time the high Priest took away that most excellent book that
was in their hands ever since the calm and peaceable times, which contained
those Songs and Prayers which were ever used before the Sacrifices, (for before
every several sacrifice they had their several songs still used in those times
of peace.) All which accurately written were transmitted to the subsequent
generations, from the time of the Legate Moses unto this day, by the Ministry
of the high Priest: this book he (the high Priest) took away, then which no
History besides the Pentateuch of Moses was found more ancient. These memorials
of forms of public and prescribed Prayer before the time of Ezra may suffice
here: the studious Reader may observe many more in the Rabbines works, and from
them in Scaliger, Seldom, Fagius, Buxtorfe, etc. From the time of Ezra until
Christ's, it is yet more evident that public forms were used. Mr. Seldom says,
that certain On Eutythius, p. 411.
forms of Prayer were to be used daily by every one, by Law, or received
custom, which were composed by Ezra and his house, or consistory. Capel us
Spicilegium, p. 68.
relates the same, and that Ezra and his house (the great Synagogue) appointed
eighteen forms of Benedictions. Rabbi Tanchum says, The wise men made these
eighteen Prayers for so many bones in the back of a man, which are to be bowed
at the rehearsal of them, because David says, All my bones shall praise thee;
which Benedictions were to be pronounced in words already conceived: And that
the number of their Prayers was according to the number of their Sacrifices,
their (...)
morning Prayer, their (...)
mincha minor and (...)
major, (i.) the lesser and greater oblation, their (...)
Evening Prayer, their (...)
additionary Prayer, and the (...)
concluding Prayer; and he adds, The Prayer for which Peter and John, Acts 3.
1. went into the Temple, was the mincha minor, which answered to the
Evening-sacrifice of the Law; and the hour, according to our account, was three
of the clock in the afternoon.

Seldom adds, that the Prayers prescribed See Drusius on the place.
Praeterit. p. 159.
by Ezra were to be learned by every man, that so the prayers of the unskilful
might be as perfect as of the eloquent man; that every act of praying was begun
with O Lord, open thou our lips, Ps. 51. 15. Ps. 31 15. De Edmend. Temporum,
lib. 6.
etc. and concluded with, Into thy hands I commit my spirit. The learned
Scaliger says, Rara illis benedictio erat sine his verbis solennibus,
Benedictus es Domine Deus noster, etc. There was seldom a blessing without
these words, Blessed art thou, O Lord God, King of Ages, who have sanctified
us, and have given commandment about these and these things. Joseph Albo Ikkar
says, lib 4. c. 35.
The men of the great Synagogue attributed the work of the Resurrection only to
the power of God, in this form; Tu potens in seculum Domine, etc. Thou O Lord,
art Almighty for ever, thou restorest the dead to life, and art of great power
to save. A little before the dispersion of the Jews, R. Gamaliel added a
nineteenth Prayer to those of Ezra, and after him others, until the daily
service grew to an hundred Prayers. The Jews Talmud, especially that part
called the Mischna, is full of such forms, which carry the names of the
ancient Rabbines that composed them; the first Chapter of the Talmud is
entitled (as Buxtorf observes) Berachos (i.) of Blessings and Prayers for the
fruits of the Earth; and the practice of the Jews (ever since the penning of
the Talmud) in recording their set forms of Prayers upon diverse occasions, is
an Argument that it was their use to compose such, and use them in more ancient
times. Now this is evident by the many volumes of public Devotions published
by them; of which it shall suffice to name these following: In the History of
Pascha, are the Blessings and Prayers belonging to that Festival. The second
part of Sepher Haa haua is concerning Prayers: Also a great Rituall and
commentary upon the Prayers of the Jews: Another, Precationes quibus utuntur
ante and post cibum; Of Prayers See Drusius Praetcrit. p. 90. Of blessing bread
and wine.
used before and after meat; which were diverse, some at public Feasts, and
others at private meals: Another named Selichos, being Prayers appointed for
obtaining mercy and forgiveness of sin.

Genebrard has translated from Maimonides officium lugentium, the office of
mourners, wherein are many forms of Prayer.

Sol. Bar R. Nathan composed a form of Prayer to be said at the visiting of
Sepulchers; of which the learned Pocock Notae Miscel. in Portam Mosis p. 227.
says, Principium Orationis hujus, etc. The beginning of this Prayer is taken
out of that which is among the forms of the hundred Benedictions, extant in the
public Liturgy of the Jews; and in the Margin he says, This is otherwise
attributed to Abraham.

Aben Ezrae on Eccles. 1. prefers the Hymns made by R. Saadiah Haggaon,
before those of Rabbi Eliezar Hakkalir: Now considering the Antiquity of many
of these forms, more then a thousand years since, and the tenaciousness of that
people in adhering to the traditions of their Fathers; and that in the Mischna
are many forms used by the Jews before our Saviors days (as shall be proved
hereafter) it is a convinceing Argument that it was usual for their Rabbis and
Doctors, even before our Saviors time, as to expound the Law in the Temple and
Synagogues, so to guide the people in their devotions, in the Synagogues and
Proseucha's (which were very many) by certain composed forms of Prayer; which
Prayers were learned, and delivered, only by orall tradition, and not
permitted to be written or made public, until that R. Hakkadosh composed the
Mischna.

And whereas Master Thorndike has observed their Prayers were read by one whom
they called the Apparator of the Synagogue, who was of inferior rank to the
Scribes and great Doctors, and of a like degree and quality as Deacons in the
Christian Church; this is an Argument that they were not entrusted to direct
the Devotion of their betters by any ex tempore effusions, but to pronounce
such Prayers as had been composed by their Superiors.

And thus we have brought down the continued use of set and prescribed forms of
Prayer to our Saviors days; wherein I have greatly exercised the patience of
my Reader: but I could not avoid it, this being a part of my groundwork, on
which I intend, after a little more labor, to build this assertion, That Saint
John Baptist (a most eminent Prophet) being to gather a new Church, and to make
a reformation of Religion, and (by instructing his Disciples in the Doctrine of
Repentance) to prepare them for the receiving of the Messeas, did, (after the
manner of other Doctors and teachers among the Jews) collect out of the
Prayers and Hymns of Moses, David, the Prophets, and other devout men, such
heads of Prayer as concerned the days of the Messiah, his Offices and
Doctrine; and of these did compose a form of Prayer, which he delivered to his
Disciples, to be publicly used by them on all solemn occasions, and to serve
as a Cognizance of their professing and owning the Doctrine taught by him;
which the Disciples of our Savior observing, on this occasion, and for the
same end, they ask, and our Savior prescribes, this form of Prayer, and
injoyns the use of it; when ye pray, say, etc.

But that I may not in this discourse seem to fight with my own shadow, as the
Pontikes once did, Qui per errorem longius cadentes umbras quasi hostium
corpora Lucius Florus.
petebant; I may say as David coming down to the battle against the
Philistines, Is there not a cause? Are there not 1 Samuel 17. 29.
too many enemies, both in opinion and practice, to our Lords Prayer? are not
the Consequences of neglecting it extremely sad? when many Christians have so
far degenerated, as to thank God they have forgotten what our Savior commanded
his Disciples to learn and say, Our Father, etc.

The grounds on which the most moderate dissenters proceed, are these:

First, that nothing is to be admitted into Christian practice, as far as it
concerns the public worship of God, for which there is not an express or
sufficient warrant in Scripture.

Secondly, That to use Prayer as a form, there is no such warrant, either in
that of Saint Matthew 6. 9. or Saint Luke 11. 12.

The first plea diverse learned men have Mr. Hooker Dr. Sanderson Preface to
last Sermons.
answered; I shall only offer against it that which Doctor Sanderson has
written to this effect; What scandal and advantage has been given to
Anabaptists and Quakers, by, What command have you in Scripture? It is like the
opening the Trojan horse, or Pandora's box, as if all had been let loose: Una
Eurusque Notusque ruunt, and swarms of Sectaries have overspread the land, and
the young striplings soon outstrip their leaders upon their own ground; as they
said, what command or example for kneeling at the Communion, for Surplices,
Lord Bishops, a penned Liturgy, and Holy days? and there stopped: These add
further, Where are your Lay-Presbyters, your Classes, your Steeple Houses, and
national Churches, your Tithes and Mortuaries, your Infant-sprinklings, and
meeter-Psalmes, your two Sacraments, and weekly Sabbaths? so far they are gone
already; Et erranti nullus terminus, there is no bound to an erroneous spirit:
Nor indeed can they that set them a going, now stop or relaim them, Fugiunt
trepidi vera and manifesta loquentem Stoicidae; for they proceed upon their own
principles: and if they say, Haec ego nunquam Mandavi (dices) olim, nec talia
suasi, We never intended, nor countenanced these things: the reply is ready,
Mentis causa malae tamen est and origo pencs te, The fountain of all these
bitter and turbulent waters is with you. They that made a stand sooner are
displeased with such as rusht on further, and declare against them; but no
great reason, when they lent them the premises, to fall out with the
conclusion.

The master in the Fable did not well to beat his maid for serving him with
thin milk, when his own Cow gave it; Why should he that gives another
scancal, be angry with him for taking it? or he that sets a stone tumbling
down the hill, blame it for not stopping where he would have it? So mischievous
a thing it is not to lay the foundation on a firm bottom. It were well if this
were helped ere it went too far. So far that Reverend Dr.

As to the second ground, that there is no warrant in Scripture for the use of
this Prayer as a form, sub judice lis est. All that I shall say here, is, That
it is a sad thing, when men are so blinded by the opinions and prejudices which
they have espoused, as that they can see nothing but what they have a mind to
see; or being defective in their own sight, will needs persuade others (as she
in the Comedy) that there is no light in the room: And in our days the Proverb
is verified, even of Aarons bells,

As every man does think,
So the bells do clink.
I cannot promise any Eye Salve to cure such inveterate diseases; it is opus
Deo dignum, the Almighties work. Those that are not wholly blinded I shall lend
the best spectacles I have, and make it my daily Prayer for my self and all (as
Bartimeus did) Lord, that our eyes may Mark 10. 31.
be opened. To all my Readers I commend this rule, Not easily to believe every
Doctrine, and take up their Religion upon trust, but to search the Scriptures
(as those more noble Bereans did) whether things be so or no; And having tried
all things, to hold fast that which is good.

An EXERCITATION Concerning the frequent use of Our LORD'S PRAYER, In the
Public worship of God.
MATTHEW. 6. 9. After this manner therefore pray ye, or (as the Original, (...).)
Thus pray ye, Our Father, etc. LUKE. 11. 2. And he said unto them, when ye
pray, say, Our Father, etc.
THESE two Evangelists seem to differ, not only in the diverse expressions used
by our Savior in the prescribing of this form, but also in the time and
occasion of the delivery thereof; some of the ancient Fathers Egthymius.
Rupertus. Mr. Mede. Dr. Lightfoot.
assert that it was twice delivered, that in S. Matthew in the second year of
our Saviors baptism, this of S. Luke in the third, (as learned Mr. Mede
computes it,) The different occasion Mr. Calvin observes, (Lucas rogatum fuisse
dicit In locum.
Mattheus inducit ultro docentem) Luke affirms that our Savior was desired to
teach it: Matthew that he taught it voluntary, and so he favors the opinion of
Mr. Mede, who with some others of great esteem, do conjecture, that the Medes
Diatrib. Paraus. Hooker.
Disciples, when it was first given them in Matthew, understood not that their
Master intended it for a form of public Prayer, whereby they might be known to
be his Disciples, and therefore they desire of him in Luke such a
distinguishing form, and that according to the example S. John Baptist his
forerunner, (for it was usual for the eminent Doctors among the Jews to compose
forms of Prayer and praise for their Disciples) Lord teach us to pray, as John
also taught his Disciples.

Sect. 2. The immediate occasion of prescribing this form in S. Matthew was our
Saviors great Montibus inquit e^ant and erant sub montibus illis. Ovid. Metam.

Poet, and the word ((...)) or much-babling, is of a near signification, as
Hesychius and Suidas expound it; learned men do parallel these expressions with

Ecclesiasticus, (...): which is translated, Use not much babbling when thou

thinks that our Savior condemns a (...), when the lips and tongue pray

word may be as well compounded of Hebrew and Greek, and as fitly as of Latin
and Greek Lyra gives the same sense of the word. (Hi exercendae linguae magis

their affections, thinking to move their Gods, as a prisoner his judge, by
oftensolicitation and importunity; or as if their God were at a great distance,
and must be called nearer by their loud cries; of this fault the Grotius in loc.
Jews were not guilty, whose prayers were generally concise, and often times
submissa voce, with a low voice. They pretend they learned to make short
prayers from Elias, in this tradition R. Josi Talmud in Sephar Herachoth.
says, on a time I walking on the way, went into one of the Deserts to pray,
then came Eliah of blessed memory and watched me at the Gate, and stayed for me
till I had ended my prayer; after that he says unto me, Peace be upon thee
Rabbi; I said to him, Peace be upon thee Rabbi and Master; then said he to me,
My Son wherefore wentest thou into the Desert? I said, to pray: He said to me,
thou might have prayed in the way: Then said I, I was afraid lest Passengers
would interrupt me: He said unto me, Thou should have prayed a short Prayer.
At that time I learned of him three things; 1. That we should not go into the
Desert. 2. That we should pray by the way. 3. That he that prays by the way,
should pray a short prayer: Two of these Traditions our Savior reproves here,
but nothing against the third. Now the Heathen were generally guilty of
irksomness and babbling; as a Poet of their own says, they thought their Gods
(nil intelligere Grotius on Matthew. ^.
nisi illud dictum sit centies) to understand nothing but what was repeated an
hundred times, and therefore they did for some hours together chaunt aloud the
same words, as (...), and (...), etc. of which practice of theirs the Scripture
records two examples, the one of Baals Prophets, crying from 1 King. 18. 26.
Act. 19. 34.
Morning till Noon, O Baal hear us! The other of the Ephesians, crying for two
hours space, Great is Diana of the Ephesians. More of this nature may be seen
in Brisonius de formulis, and not much unlike are the Tautologies in the Popish
Missals, Jesu, Jesu, Jesu miserere, Jesu, Jesu, Jesu adjuva, Jesu, Jesu, Jesu
da mihi purgatorium meum hic. In opposition to such practices, our Savior
prescribes a succinct form of most significant words, not only injoyning them
when they did compose Prayers of their own to have respect to this, as a rule;
but when they did actually, and solemnly pray, to use this form; for here is
evidently (transitus a formula ad formulam) a passing from one form to another;
from their tedious Tautologies, who thought their Gods needed them, to awaken
and excite them to their help, by loud noise, and long clamor, to a
compendious and most comprehensive expression of all such desires as concern
the glory of God, or man's temporal or eternal happiness; all which being
composed in a most exquisite form, he commends to his Disciples and the
multitude with an (...), (...), thus pray ye, or more plainly (...), when ye
pray, say, Our Father.

Sect. 3. The occasion of repeating this form in S. Luke was an earnest request
of the Disciples, who having observed the practice of S. John's Disciples,
desire that our Savior would teach them as John also had taught his Disciples.
In which request we may plainly observe

1. Rem. The desired matter, Teach us to pray. 2. Modum. The manner, As John
also taught his Disciples,
For they were as yet ignorant, both as to the matter, what things to ask, and
also to the manner, how to ask fitly and orderly.

In our Saviors answer are also two parts,

1 Indeterminatio temporis, The not determining of the time, when ye pray. 2
Determinatio orationis ad rem and modum, The determining of the Prayer, as well
in its manner and form, as matter, say, Our Father, etc.
For beyond all question, our Savior in this, as in all other good things, did
satisfy the desires of his Disciples as well in the manner as the matter of
their request, direction for both these being desired; if therefore it shall be
proved that John Baptist taught his Disciples a form of Prayer which they used
publicly, and by which they were distinguished from the Disciples of other
Jewish Doctors, and known to be followers of S. John, it may be irrefragably
inferred that our Savior taught his Disciples this Prayer to be also used as a
public form, and to serve as a cognizance, whereby they might be known to be
his followers.

Sect. 4. Now to confirm this, I shall add (to what has been alleged in the
Preface,) the authorities of diverse learned men, and such (for the most part)
whose piety and judgment, have in other things a great esteem, and influence
upon such as dissent, as an argument ad homines. But in the first place, I
shall briefly premise, that John Baptist, being himself a Jewish Doctor, did
(as our Savior also did) observe the Rites and Customs then in use among that
people, and accommodate them to the business of the Gospel: thus it was usual
with them to admit Proselytes by baptism; for as Doctor Lightfoot Dr.
Lightfoot's Mistel. p. 80. See Dr. Hammonds Quaeries. Ariaes Montanus on Luke
11. 1.
observes, that in Solomon's time, when men became Proselytes by thousands, they
admitted them by baptism (as some Jews do witness, says he.) And Arias
Montanus a man that knew the customs and practices of that people as well as
any in his time, gives this brief Comment on the occasion of prescribing this
Prayer; Aliqua orationis formuld, certi argumenti, nos imbue, ut caeteri
Magistri suos Discipulos, utque Johannes, qui ex doctrinae suae de poenitentia,
praeceptis, precationes opportunas composuit, (. i.) Give us a form of Prayer
of an invariable matter or Argument, as other Masters gave their Disciples, and
as John who out of the Precepts of his doctrine of Repentance, did compose
certain seasonable Prayers. And doubtless our own Expositors have not taken up
this opinion upon bare trust, but deliver it to us as their judgment upon good
grounds. Calvin who here, as on most other places, Calvin's Harm. p. 150. mihi.
comments most judiciously, gives the like sense, his words are these, in
respect of the more public Prayers of that Church; Johannes privatam orandi
formam tradidit suis Discipulis; id fecisse existimo, prout temporis ratio
ferebat. Res tunc valde apud Iudaeos corruptas fuisse notum est, tota certe
religio sic collapsa erat, ut mirum non sit, precandi morem a paucis rite
cultum fuisse: rursus, quum instaret promissa redemptio, fidelium mentes
precando ad ejus spem and desiderium excitari oportuit. Johannes ergo, ex
variis Scriptura locis certam aliquam precationem conficere potuit quae tempori
congrueret, ac propius accederet ad spirituale Christi regnum, quod jam
patefieri coeperat. (. i.) John gave his Disciples a private form of Prayer,
which I think, he did as the custom of that age did require. Great corruption
was then among the Jews, their whole religion was so decayed, that it is no
wonder that the manner of praying was rightly observed by very few; and because
the promised redemption drew nigh, it was necessary to excite the minds of the
faithful by prayer, to hope and desire the accomplishment thereof; John
therefore out of diverse places of Scripture, could, (. i.) (as I understand
him, de jure, rightly and with good authority, for he had spoken de facto
before) compose some certain form of prayer which was agreeable to the present
time, and most suitable to the spiritual Kingdom of Christ, which then began to
be manifested. This I suppose is a just interpretation of Mr. Calvin's words and
sense; and in this he fully accords with my assertion concerning the practice
of the Jewish Doctors, and particularly of John Baptist, in teaching their
Disciples a form of prayer: to him I join our judicious Hookers Eccl. Peli^ l.
5.
Hooker, who in this (conjurat amice) is of the same mind. John Baptists
disciples (says he) which had always been brought up in the bosom of the
Church from the time of their first infancy, till the time that they came to
the School of John, were not so brutish that they could be ignorant to call
upon the name of God; but of their Master they had received a form of prayer
amongst themselves, which form none did use but his Disciples, so that by it as
by a mark of special difference they were known from others; and of this the
Apostles having taken notice, they request that as John taught his Disciples,
so Christ would likewise teach them, to pray. Doctor Lightfoot Dr. Lightfoot's
Harm. p. 47.
will make this argument stronger yet; thus, says he, Christ taught this
prayer almost a year and half ago in his Sermon on the Mount, and now being
desired to teach his Disciples to pray, he gives the same again. John had
taught his to pray after the same manner and use of the Nation, and Christ
being desired to teach his Disciples as John had taught his, rehearses this
form which he had given them before: were these arguments considered without
prejudice, I should not need to add more to prove this prayer a Form intended
for public use.

But I fear all that may be said will not satisfy some men; yet because this
argument will be as a chief stone, on which (as to the context) we may lay some
stress, I shall take a little more pains to settle it, viz. That John did,
after the manner of Jewish Doctors, teach his Disciples a brief form of prayer
to be frequently used by them, which accordingly they did often, and publicly
use, whereby they were known to be his Disciples.

Sect. 5. I was once confidently informed that the late Bishop of Worcester had
in some determinations of his when he was Doctor of the Chair in Oxford,
repeated the form of prayer that was dictated by S. John to his Disciples; but
upon inquiry I could find no such thing, and indeed I did despair of it, when
instead of finding it recorded among ancient monuments, I found that many
Tertullian. Maldonate Compare Matthew. 3. 2. with c. 4. 17.
learned men did bewail the loss of it. In all probability it did agree, both
in matter and form, with this of our Savior; as their form of Doctrine was
alike, Repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand, so likely was their form of
Prayer. However their authority that argue merely negatively (that there was no
such form because it is not recorded in Scripture) will signify but little,
when in the first place, it shall be considered, how many things are mentioned
in Scripture as done, the particulars whereof (in regesta) S. Judes Epist. ver.
6. 9.
are not to be found; and Tertullian tells us that John's form was purposely
omitted, that our Saviors alone might be used; John must decrease Joh. 3. 30.
that Christ may increase: and secondly, when it shall be laid in the balance
with the judgment of those learned and famous men that are otherwise minded.
The Assembly in Assemblies Annot. on Luke.
their Annotations comment thus; (As John also taught) that is giving them a
form. It seems that because Religion was miserably corrupted by the false
Glosses, and superstitious Traditions of the Pharisees, as also by a general
depravation of manners, so that it was no marvel if very few of them, either
rightly practiced, or truly understood the main part of Gods worship, which is
in devout and faithful prayer, therefore, whereas now, the long promised
redemption of the faithful drew near, it was necessary that their hope should
be strengthened by prayer to expect it, so that John Baptist whose office it
was to prepare the way of Christ, did out of most evident places of Scripture
thereto pertinent, compose for his Disciples (whom he was to instruct and fit
to receive the Messiah) some private prayer suitable to their present In
Calvin's sense.
condition, and the spiritual Kingdom of Christ, which they were to profess.

that is, giving them some express form of it.

Doctor Lightfoot, whom we have before named, Doctor Lightfoot supra.
says, they that deny this for a form of prayer, either know not or consider
not, what kind of prayers the eminent men among the Jews taught them.

Sect. 6. And whosoever shall read the Mischna and Gemara, Seder Tephiloth of
the Jews of Portugal, the Comment on Perke Avoth, Sepher Hammusar, Machazor,
and other Rabbinical writings, he may see many remains of forms of Prayer made
by their ancient Doctors, and retaining still the inscription of their names.
It is to be known, says learned Mr. Thorndike, that things related in the
Misna written in the Thorndike of the service of God, p. 232.
days of Antoninus Pius, are not to be understood as if they were of no
greater standing then that time, but are the most ancient orders of that
people, practiced and delivered long before from hand to hand, as things not
lawful to be committed to writing, and then first written, for fear that their
manifold dispersions might bring their rules and orders into oblivion. And from
the first title of the Misna we have enough to evince this whole point, for
there we have diverse cases concerning the formal words of diverse of those
prayers which still they use, resolved by Doctors that lived not long after our
Saviors time, and therefore the terms and cases of more ancient Doctors
disputed at that time by these, must needs be of greater antiquity. Scaligers
Scaliger de Emend. Temp. l. 6. p. 537.
hand shall be the last that shall be applied for the settlement of this stone.

Si quis neget, etc. If any deny the antiquity of these Record, it is all one
as if he should deny the Determinations of Papinian, Paul, Ulpian, and other
Lawyers registered in the Digests of Justinian, to be their resolutions under
whose names they are cited. And now I know no more to be done toward the
settlement of this stone, but to fill up the chinks and to polish it, I shall
add these considerations;

Sect. 7. 1. That S. John's Disciples did use such a distinct form of prayer, as
that they were thereby known by all that heard them to belong unto him, is
clearly intimated in the Disciples question, which was occasioned by this
observation of theirs; Master, teach us to pray, as John also taught his
Disciples.

2. This prayer, so commonly used by them, must be either of their own
composure, agreeable to certain heads prescribed by their Master; or else a set
form.

That it should be of their own composure, according to their diverse abilities,
is unlikely;

1. Because the Disciples of John were generally but of a mean condition, and
to think that they had any extraordinary gifts bestowed upon them so early,
(our Saviors own Disciples, after they had been a long time with him, being
but meanly qualified, before the coming of the Holy Ghost) is somewhat
dissonant from the truth of the holy Scriptures, and the wisdom of our Savior,
that did not (on this supposition) choose Disciples for himself as well
qualified as S. John's were; but in all probability they were both of them
ignorant, not only of the matter, what to ask, but (which seems most
difficult) of the manner also how to ask aright.

2. Because, as has been proved, other Doctors among the Jews did usually
prescribe the very form of prayer that was used by their Disciples, and the
composure of public prayer was not the work of ordinary Disciples, but the
office of one, or more, eminent men in all ages of that Church.

3. Because if S. John had only given his Disciples heads of prayer, and not a
set form, this would not have conduced to the production of that effect which
the Scripture intimates to have followed, (viz.) to make them known to all that
heard them whose Disciples they were; for though their prayers for the matter
of them might be agreeable, yet differing wholly in form, and variety of
expressions, they could not be well understood by people of mean capacities, to
have followed the same rule; this I guess from the little uniformity observed
in the devotion of such as follow the heads of prayer prescribed by the
Directory. For though there be a good method and excellent matter proposed, yet
men being left to their own composures, they either slight the method, or so
invert, confound, perplex and obscure the matter thereof in their own
expressions, as that it can justly be said but of a few, these do observe the
Directory.

4. Questionless the matter of S. John's prayer had a great harmony with the
chief heads which were ordinarily used by the Disciples of other Jewish
Doctors, and therefore it must be the form that made the distinction.

5. And lasty, If we may judge of a deed by its counterpart, our Savior
delivering in his answer a form of prayer, (as is granted by all) does more
then intimate that the prayer taught by John, and that which was desired by his
own Disciples, (unless we should think that our Savior answered
impertinently) was a form. So that if we should paraphrase the words thus, Lord
teach us a prayer whereby we may be known to be thy Disciples, as John also
taught his Disciples a prayer, whereby we and all that hear them, may know
whose Disciples they are: Our Saviors answer, delivering a composed form, does
approve this interpretation, When ye pray, say this form, Our Father.

Sect. 8. And upon these premises I may build this conclusion, that the prayer
delivered by our Savior on the request of his Disciples, according to the
instance of S. John, was not intended only as a Directory for matter and method
of prayer, but as a set form to be used by them, and to serve as a peculiar
mark, and character that they were his Disciples.

Sect. 9. But before we consider the words of the injunction and command, this
one thing may be opportunely, and materially inserted, that (as it has been
already proved) forms of prayer were used in the Jewish Church until our
Saviourstime; so our Savior himself did not dislike, or abhor from, either
forms of prayer in general, or those forms which were then in use among the
Jews in particular; for the Scripture assures us that in a great extremity,
when as we may all think our Savior would pray most fervently, he used the
same words three times, (viz.) Father; if it be possible; let this cup pass
from me: And it is the opinion of many learned men, that our Savior on the
Cross did repeat, not only the first verse of Psalm. 22. but the whole Psalm
throughout, which undoubtedly is a form. S. Hierom speaking of Mat. 17. 46.
Hier. advers. Pelagium. p. 248. mihi.
Christ's prayer on the Cross, repeats more as spoken by Christ, then is
recorded by S. Matthew; (Sic Christus or avit in Cruce) My God, my God; why
have thou forsaken me? why art thou so far from helping me, and from the words
of my roaring?

Sect. 10. Moreover it is proved by learned men, beyond all contradiction, that
our Savior in the dispensation of the New Testament, did retain and practice
several forms, which were used by the Jews under the Old: Particularly, in
the Institution and administration of his last Supper, our Savior varied very
little from the forms and customs used by them at the celebration of the
Passover; of the truth whereof besides other reasons, this in the opinion of
learned men is a sufficient confirmation: That as the Jews were wont to shut
up the solemnity of the Passover by singing some of David's Psalms; so our
Savior, after the celebration of the Sacrament of his body and blood, went out
with his Disciples to the Mount of Olives, (...), having sung the Hymn, which
Hymn (say the best Expositors) was the same that the Jews did ordinarily sing
after the Passover, and is called by them the great Hallel, which, as Pau'us
Brugensis says, consisted of six Psalms, from Psalm. 113. to Psalm. 118. and he
adds (verisimile est P. Brugen. in Ps. 113.
hos a Domino decantatos) it is most like that these were sung by our Savior.
And Drusius says, hunc hymnum hodieque canunt in nocte Paschatis; Drusius
obser. p. 156.
The Jews sing this Hymn in the evening of the Passover to this day. The
learned Scaliger having largely described the forms and rites of celebrating
the Passover, concludes thus; This was the true rite of celebrating the
Passover in the times of the Messiah, -- No man will deny that this last was
like unto the former, and that Christ did celebrate them in the same manner as
the Jews (viz.) both of them in the manner expounded. And he concludes thus;
They that object that Christ did not submit to the Jewish customs, may be
confuted by six hundred arguments, if it were of moment; and I believe that
Drusius, Capellus, Doctor Lightfoot and others have made up the full number.

In the conference at Hampton Court, we have Conference at Hampton. p. 67.
this passage; the Dean of the Chapel (who I suppose was Bishop Mountague)
remembered the practice of the Jews, who unto the Institution of the Passover
prescribed unto them by Moses had (as the Rabbines witness) added both signs
and words, eating sour herbs and drinking wine, with these words, Take, eat
these in remembrance, etc. And, Drink this in remembrance, etc. upon which
Addition, and Tradition of theirs, our Savior instituted the Sacrament of his
last Supper, celebrating it with the same words and after the same manner,
thereby approving that fact of theirs in particular. Scaliger tells us, there
was Bread also as well as Scaliger de Emend. Temp. p. 536.
Wine exhibited at the Passover, with these words, (...). This is the bread of
affliction, which your fathers did eat in the land of Egypt; let every one that
hungreth come and eat, let every one that has need come and keep the
Passover; ye were sometime servants there, but now ye are in the land of
Israel; ye were sometime servants there, but now ye are free in the land of
Israel.

Now if our Savior did accommodate the Jewish forms, (some of which were
merely of humane invention) to the solemn administration of that most blessed
Sacrament, which is to 1 Cor. 11. 26.
continue in his Church until his coming again; we may not think it strange
that he should prescribe a form of prayer of his own composure, and enjoin his
Disciples the frequent use of it in their solemn devotions.

Doctor Lightfoot descends to particular instances, as that our Savior after
the cup of blessing, Temple Service p. 161.
took some of the unleavened bread and blessed and brake it, and gave it to be
eaten for his body from thenceforth in that sense, that the flesh of the
Paschal Lamb had been his body unto that time; and that which was called the
Cup of Hallel, he takes and ordains for the Cup of the New Testament in his
blood, and after sung the Hallel throughout, and so went out to the Mount of
Olives. And Arias Montanus Montanus de hymno.
notes, that the use of this Hymn was an action and rite common and most
familiar to all.

Mr. Trap gives also another instance of our On Mat. 6. 9. Luke 24. 30.
Saviors using a form of thanksgiving, by which, as it is intimated in S.
Luke, his Disciples knew him. I shall not insist on this, but certainly the
Jews had forms of blessing their meat and drink; as these usual forms do
evince: The blessing of the bread was this, (Benedictus tu Domine Deus noster
Rex Seculi, qui educis panem e terra.) And (Benedictus, etc. qui creas fructum
vitis.) (. i.) Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, everlasting King, who do
bring forth bread out of the earth, and blessed, etc. who createst the fruit of
the vine. But enough of this; he that would see more of the former particulars,
let him view Cassander, Morney of the Mass, Beza, Doctor Lightfoot, Doctor
Heylyn of Liturgies. All my observations do concentre with that of a Reverend
Divine in his book of singing Psalms, that this opinion is the constant vote
of all the learned. And here by the way, that assertion of Grotius is
sufficiently confuted, Neque enim eo Grotius in Luke 11. 1.
tempore syllabis adstringebantur; for what he only says in the Negative,
Scaliger, and many others of great learning and integrity, do not only say,
but prove in the affirmative; (. i.) that the people were not in those days
confined to words and syllables.

By what has been said, it appears that our Savior was no such enemy to
forms, either of prayer or thanksgiving, as those who now profess themselves to
be his choice Disciples, are known to be, even to his own form of prayer.

Sect. 11. But I shall make an essay beyond this, to prove that our Savior in
the composure of his prayer had respect unto the devotion and prayers of the
Church of the Jews then in use, and was pleased to compose his for marter and
method like unto theirs. And that I may allay the prejudice, which this
conjecture is like to create, I offer these grounds for it; 1. That our Savior
being to reconcile Jews and Gentiles into one, could not use a better medium
to win upon them both, then by injoyning such an uniformity in the chief part
of Gods worship, as was consistent with the common good and desires of all
mankind in general, and agreeable to the Jews own forms of devotion, (they
having been for a long time Gods peculiar people) in special. Nor, 2. is it any
disparagement to our Savior, the eternal Wisdom of the Father, that he did
create a prayer as beautiful as the heavens, out of such a Chaos, and gather up
those Jewels out of that dunghill wherein they had obscured them, and set them
in such a heavenly frame, as nothing out of heaven or the Scriptures (whereof
this is Arias Mont. Formula ex Sacris Script. Petita.
the sum, as many Divines affirm) is half so perfect: For certainly, they had
these petitions out of the Scripture from the Prophets and holy men of God. And
Mr. Lightfoot applies that to the Talmud (wherein many of these are) which was
said of the works of Origin, Ubi been nemo melius, That which is good is very
good, and that which is bad is very bad.

And now remembering you that our Savior did in other parts of Gods worship
comply with the accustomed forms of the Jewish Church, it will appear very
probable that he did the same in respect of Prayer, both as to the method, and
form of it.

The likeness of Method has been observed from Mr. Seldom, who says, that of
the eighteen Prayers or Benedictions (called in the Gemara, composed, or
appointed Prayers, and which were for a long time the chief body of their
devotion) the three first, and the three last, respected the glory of God, the
other twelve those things that were necessary either for the whole people of
God, or for every particular man. And whether our Savior did not design his
Prayer, (though not according to the number of their Petitions, yet) to the
general method and matter of them, (vi.) the three first branches of it, and
the conclusion (which may serve for three more,) referring to the glory of God,
the other intermediate to the public and private necessities of Gods people,
is of easy observation.

Then for the particular Heads and Petitions, they are more obvious; we shall
give an instance of each: First, for the Preface, it is commonly known that the
Jews did prefix to their Prayers these two letters (...), which, as Buxtorf in
his Buxtorf. Heinsius.
Abbreviations, says, do signify the Preface of our Lords Prayer, (viz.) Our
Father which art in Heaven. Dr. Lightfoot notes, that in Folio Miscel. p. 57.
5. of their Common Prayer Book is this passage, Humble your hearts before your
Father which is in Heaven: and he proves the appellation of On Matt. 6. 9.
Our Father to be common among the Jews in those days; and both he and
Heinsius do add- Ubique Christus hoc egisse videtur, ut ad receptas paroemias,
axiomata, vel formulas respiceret. The Heinsius. Dr. Lightfoot.
Doctor seems to translate him thus, Christ has an eye and reference to their
Customs, Language, Doctrines, Traditions and Opinions, almost in every line.

Drusius gives the reason why to the appellation of Our Father, they added as a
note of distinction, Which art in Heaven, because they did frequently call the
Patriarchs by that Title, Pater noster Abraham, Isaac Pater noster, Jacob Pater
noster, our father Abraham, etc. Therefore when they call God Our Father, they
usually add, which art in Heaven: and so Capellus Spicilegium, on Matthew. 6. 9.
gives the Preface entire, out of Seder Tephilloth of the Jews of Portugal
(i.) their order of Prayers for the whole year; used as Buxtorf says, by the
Jews of France, Germany, Poland, Italy and Spain;) thus, Our Father which art
in Heaven be gracious unto us. And in Machazor (i.) Cyclus, a circle of Prayers
for their greatest Festivals. Let our Prayers be accepted before our Father
which is in Heaven. Then for the first Petition, Hallowed be thy Name, in Seder
Tephilloth, p. 114.
Hallowed be thy Name O Lord our God, and let thy memorial be glorified, O our
King (in Gregory's notes.
heaven above, and on the earth beneath.) Master Gregory from the comment on
Fol. 24.
Perk Avoth transcribes the second Petition, Let thy Kingdom reign over us for
ever and ever. Doctor Lightfoot says, they pray almost in every other prayer
Miscel. E. lib. Musar. 49. 1.
thy Kingdom come, and that bimherah beiamenu, quickly in these our days. And
Drusius mentions all these: Deus noster qui in coelo unicus es, etc. Our God
which art one in Heaven, let thy Name be established for ever, let thy Kingdom
rule over us for ever and ever, and let thy Name be sanctified by our works.

The fourth Petition has such an evident agreement with that Prayer of Agur,
Feed me Pro. 30. 8.
with food convenient for me; which phrase our Bibles do parallel with this
Petition, by quoting Matt. 6. 11.
it in the margin, and is such an approved Exposition of it in the Rabbis
sense, that I will not trouble my self or Reader to transcribe other instances.

The fifth Petition they express thus; Our pious forefathers were wont to say,
remit and pardon all them that trouble me. This Drusius, Doctor Lightfoot, and
Master Gregory observe from the Comment on Avoth, fol. 24.

The last Petition is in Seder Tephilloth, p. 115. Lead us not into sin, nor
into transgression, nor into temptation; and remove from me every evil
imagination. The word (...) signifies the Devil, or Original sin and
concupiscence: This Petition Master Gregory repeats thus out of Sepher So
Drusius.
Hammassar, p. 49. Lead us not into the power of temptation, but deliver us
from evil: And to this they immediately subjoyn a like Doxology, Quia tuum est
regnum, and regnabis gloriose in seculae seculorum. Of this we shall have
occasion to speak hereafter. Solomon Glassius asserts also very Sol. Glassius
part prima, p. 149. 1 Chronicles. 29. 11.
confidently, that our Savior in this Doxology had respect to that of Solomon,
Thine, O Lord, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory; and again, thine
is the Kingdom, (Ex qua desumpsisse Christus clausulam istam (...) omnino
videtur) from which form it fully appears, our Savior took the Doxologie in
the close of his Prayer: And very usual it was with the Jews, to shut up their
devotions with such short forms of praise. And thus having found both the
method and the matter of our Lords Prayer in the Devotion of the Jews, it
only remains, that we answer one Objection or two against our assertion,
(viz.) That our Savior in the framing of this most heavenly form, had respect
unto the forms of Prayer, then in use among the Jews, the grounds of which we
have laid already.

The first Objection is, that these books from which it is supposed, that our
Savior borrowed Sect. 12. Object.
the heads of his Prayer, are of a far later date, then our Saviors time, and
therefore, they may more probably be thought to have transcribed something out
of the Gospels, then that our Savior, the very wisdom of God, should borrow
any thing from their devotions.

To this Objection a satisfactory answer has Answ.
been given already by Scaliger, and Master Thorndike; to which (ex abundanti)
it may be added, That it is true, the Books themselves are not (some of them)
above a thousand, or eleven hundred years old, but yet they do record matter:
of a far greater Antiquity; as books printed in this very age may record such
rites and forms as were in use among primitive Christians for more then a
thousand years since; so (for instance) in the late Liturgy were the best parts
and offices of devotion preserved that had been used by any Church since the
Apostle; days: And as for the Mischna, wherein most of these petitions are
extant, it is known to be one part of that Talmud which was compiled by R.
Hakkadosh, who lived in the year of Christ 150. that is 1508. years since; and
the Title, and Contents of it is this, Liber traditionum, qui Patrum
traditiones continet, quae inde a Mose observatae, and successive So Buxtorf.
per oralem traditionem propagatae fuerunt. The book of traditions, which
contains the traditions of the Fathers which had been observed from that time
unto Moses, and were successively propagated by Oral tradition. Maimonides
gives us this series of the tradition. R. Hakkadosh Per Pocock p. 33, 34.
had it from Simeon his father, he from Gamaliel his father, he from another
Simeon his father, he from another Gamaliel his father, he from a third Simeon,
he from Hillel, he from Shemaiah and Abtalion his masters, they from Judas the
son of Tabbaeus, etc. unto Simeon the Just, who had it from Ezra, he from the
Prophets successively, they from the Judges and Elders of Israel, they from
Joshua, he from Moses, who (as they pretend) had many of them from God.

Arias Montanus, speaking of the form in which Montanus on Matt. 16. 30.
Christ gave thanks, says thus, Porro illa gratiarum actionis formula antiqua
est, ut constat ex (...) Israelitarum, and ex Mischnaioth. Now if these books
prove the antiquity of that form used by our Savior, they must relate it as a
matter of fact beyond the time of our Savior, in the judgment of that learned
man. And certainly, the forms and heads of Devotion, used and recorded by these
later Jews of Portugal, were the product of more ancienttimes, and were then
collected and composed by them, that they might not be lost and forgotten in
the dispersion, as they had lost many Customs and Manners, and their very
Language, in the Babylonish captivity. In one of the Petitions above named,
they say so much expressly (dicebant pii priores) Our pious forefathers were
wont to say, etc.

And considering how superstitiously tenacious they have ever been of the
customs and traditions of their forefathers, retaining and practicing in their
Synagogues, to this very day, many things which their Ancestors practiced long
before our Saviors time, it cannot reasonably be thought that they did coin
any new devotions, or at least that they did insert any such there; but least
of all, would they have stamped upon them the likeness of our Lords Prayer in
every Character, as we shall now show in answer to the second Objection, which
is --

2. Object. That possibly the Rabbines, since Sect. 13.
the days of our Savior, may have borrowed some parts and expressions of
their Devotion, from our Lords Prayer, and from other Evangelical passages; but
that our Savior, the very wisdom of his Father, should be beholden to the
Jewish Liturgies, and Forms for his Devotion, is not with any reason to be
imagined.

1. Answer. This Objection is made somewhat unadvisedly; for if it were true
that the Jews did insert these Petitions into their Devotion, from our
Saviors Prayer, it would be a sad consideration that the Jews should show
more respect and observance to the prescriptions of our Savior, then such as
would be accounted the most excellent Christians.

Secondly, It has been already proved beyond all contradiction, that our
Savior was pleased to practice and retain diverse Jewish forms, and adapted
them to the Ministry of the Gospel, and commended them to his Disciples in
the principal service of God; and therefore there is sufficient ground to
assert, that he did the same in this business of devotion. But on the contrary
there will be but rare instances given, that the Jews did make use of any new
Rite, Institution, Doctrine or History which is proper to the Gospel, in those
ancient Records of theirs, so as to use or approve the same, and therefore it
is unlike that they had any respect to this Prayer in their Devotions.

Thirdly, It is yet more incredible that the Jews, who abhor the very name of
Christ, and make many solemn, public imprecations against him and all his
followers, should transcribe any thing of his, into their Devotion, much less
that every Petition of our Saviors Prayer should find Part 4. Chap. 9. See
Buxtorfs Biblioth. Rab.
place in theirs; for in the very Talmud, one Chapter is entitled De
Idololatria, ac vitanda omni conversatione and societate cum Christianis. Of
Idolatry, and of avoiding all manner of society and conversation with the
Christians: And Buxtorf says of them, In secretissimis little Synag. Jud.
libris scribunt and docent quod anima Esaui corpus Christi subingressa est;
They call Christians Edomites and Esauites: and in exemplaribus vetustis, says
he, they have sundry forms of imprecation against Christians, of which take
this one: Let them be destroyed and have no more hope, and let all the Infidels
(they mean Christians especially) perish in the twinkling of an eye, and all
thy enemies which have hated thee, O Lord our God, be suddenly rooted out, and
that proud and presumptuous Kingdom be quickly overthrown, and at last come to
a total ruin; and make them without delay subservient to us in these our
days. That the Turks should record some of our Saviors sentences is not
strange, seeing they account him to have been a Prophet, and I have read, that
among their devotions they have a Prayer which they call the Prayer of Jesus
the Son of Mary, which differs little from ours, only it ends thus; And let
not him have rule over me that will have no mercy upon me, O thou most High.
But that the Jews who hate and nauseate every thing that has the least savor
of Christianity, eo nomine as it is Christian, should insert this most
Christian Prayer, in its full latitude, into their prayers, is certainly a vain
imagination.

Yet, as you see, both Jews and Turks do retain, (though not as Christian)
both the form and matter of this Prayer; where then are the enemies of it, if
they be friends? Alas! in Christ's own house, among them for whose sake chiefly
it was written, and unto whom it was not only commended as a privilege, but
commanded as a duty, among Christ's own stewards and servants: Of our own selves
(as the Apostle says) have men arose speaking perverse Acts 10. 30.
things: they that had made it their familiar, and would not eat at Gods Table,
or sleep in their own beds without it, have, (I will not say done it
themselves, but) given occasion to others to Psalm. 41. 9.
lift up the heel against, or, as the Marginal reading is, have magnified every
petty imperfect prayer against it. We applaud and admire the gifts and forms
of Prayer used by diverse men, all which are beautiful in their kind, and have
done excellently, and for them I shall join with any Prove. 31. 29.
to bless God; but when this Prayer which excels them all, non laudatur, or,
as Pagnines interlineary interpretation, non Epithalamio celebratur, is not
celebrated and espoused, but is neglected Psalm. 78. 63. 1 Cor. 1. 12.
and slighted, when, as the Apostle observes, One is of Paul, another of
Apollos, another of Cephas, to the having men's persons in admiration, and
slighting the things of Christ in their plainness and simplicity, this is
utterly a fault.

As to the rise of this practice in former times, Sect. 14.
I can discern no other ground, but either the stifeling of some truth, or the
venting of some heresy, or the continuing more securely in some sin; one or
more of which has been certainly the ground why the use of it has been
formerly laid aside. Aug. ad patres Milevit. Epist. 92. and 94. See Ravenel. in
ver. Oration Dominica.


The first enemy to the use of it was Pelagius, as both St. Augustine and St.
Hierome assure us; Pelagioni or ationem Dominicam impiis disputationibus
auferre conabantur, evertentes duos artieulos, Dimitte nobis, and Ne nos
inducas: The Pelagians did endeavor with wicked disputations to take away the
use of our Lords Prayer, overthrowing these two Articles, For give us our
trespasses, and lead us not into temptation. You see they would have sacrificed
this Prayer to their heresies; for which among other things they are worthily
branded for heretics in Church-Historie.

Saint Hierome deals more roundly with him, Adv. Pelag. lib. 3. p. 248.
thus; Sic docuit Apostolos suos, ut quotidie in corporis illius sacrificio
oredentes audeant loqui, Pater noster, etc. Thus did Christ teach his Apostles,
that they should constantly at the Sacrament of his Body say Our Father; and
accordingly they desire that the name of God, which is most holy in it self,
may be sanctified in them: but thou say, Lord, thou know how holy,
innocent and pure my hands are: They say, Thy Kingdom come, antedating the
hope of Christ's Kingdom that was to come; that he reigning, sin might not
reign in their mortal bodies: They say, Thy will be done, that humane weakness
might imitate the Angels. Thou say a man may, if he will be free from all
sin. They say, Give us, etc. praying for that supersubstantial bread, that they
might be fit to receive the body of Christ: And ye by supererrogatory holiness,
and a confident righteousness, boldly challenge heavenly gifts. They (as it
follows) For give us, etc. coming from the Font of Baptism, and being
regenerate through the Lord our Savior, presently at the first communion of
Christ's body: They say, Forgive us, etc. not in a feigned pretense of
humility, but in consciousness of their humane weakness: They say, Lead us
not, etc. Thou say (with Jovinian) that they who have by Faith received
Baptism, cannot be tempted, or sin any more: Lastly, They say, Deliver us,
etc. Why do they pray for that which they have in the power of their own
freewill? This is the Leader, and these the grounds of his defiance against the
Lords Prayer, (viz.) that he might raise his errors upon the ruin of it. And
whether heretics in our days have not served themselves, and advantaged
their errors both in Doctrine and Practice, by the disuse of it, ought by all
sober Christians to be considered and laid to heart.

The Papists are marshalled in the next rank as enemies to this Prayer; and
that first for locking up the whole Prayer from the people, under an unknown
language, and giving them only the shell to chew upon; their affections and
understandings being unmoved and silent, while their lips and tongues are busy.

Secondly, for curtailing it, and omitting the whole Doxologie.

Thirdly, for preferring the use of their Ave Maria's, and Prayers of other
Saints, above this, as learned Chemnitius complains. Chemnit. Harm. p. 1977.


(In Papatu circumtulerunt precationes Sanctae Brigiddae, promittentes largas
indulgentias iis qui eas recitarunt, interim Orationis Dominicae prorsus obliti
erant:) In the papacy they carry about the Prayers of Saint Bridget, promising
large Indulgencies to such as would recite them, being in the mean time wholly
forgetful of our Lords Prayer.

Lonicer reckons also the Disciples of one Theatrun. Hist. p. 91.
Martine Steinsback of Selestad in Germany, for professed enemies to it, who,
(as once a proud Spaniard said, that if he had been with God at the Creation,
he would have contrived things better) did go about to correct the Lords
Prayer, as not well composed.

King James says, the Brownists did not like On the Lords, Prayer.
it, because it was a form. Maresius a learned Frenchman numbers diverse others
that have imagined strange things against it.

And lastly, (for I am not so well acquainted Pansebia p. 389.
with the enemies tenets, as to reckon all,) Ross tells us of some that are
against forms, chiefly the Lords Prayer, accounting such forms a choking of
the Spirit. And when our Savior tells us, that He that is not with him is
against him, there are many more that are not so fast Matthew. 12. 30.
friends unto this Prayer as they ought to be; for it is not enough to call him
Lord and Master, except we also do the things that he has commanded us: we
profess to worship him in Prayers and Supplications of our own devising; and
these things indeed we ought to do, but then we should be sure not to leave
the other undone, that is, to worship and invocate him in the same manner and
form as he has prescribed in his Word. It may suffice to have offered these
Arguments, from the occasion and context, of which this is a Sylloge:

1. Forms of Prayer were in use among the Jews.

2. Their Doctors did ordinarily compose prayers to be used by their Disciples.

3. Saint John, at first a Jewish Doctor, upon new emergencies taught his
Disciples a new form.

4. The Disciples so used that form, as that they were thereby observed and
known to be John's Disciples.

5. Upon this consideration the Disciples of our Savior desired from him such
a form of Prayer.

6. Our Savior, who was no enemy to forms in general, nor to the forms of
Prayer then used by the Jews in particular, did, agreeably to them, compose for
his Disciples a certain form to be used by them, delivering it to them at two
several times, and on diverse occasions; but on both these with a plain
injunction, Thus pray ye, and, when we pay, say, Our Father, etc.

It comes now to be considered, whether the Sect. 15.
terms under which our Savior injoyns it do aamount to the nature of a
Precept, so as to oblige Christians to the use of this Prayer in express words,
and as a form; and this, supposing it had not been twice delivered, nor on such
an occasion as St. Luke relates: And in order hereunto we have the import of
two words in Saint Matthew to be considered, (viz.) (...). And here I must
remember you, that our Savior having reproved the tedious repetitions of
heathnish forms, passes on to a most excellent form of his own, and injoyns it
with an (...), Thus pray ye: Which word is in all languages used to signify an
identity and individuality with the thing to which it has reference; as when I
endite to any, and bid him write thus or thus, I intend he should write the
same words; and so doubtless, when Christ commanded his Disciples to pray,
Thus: he meant in the same words. Indeed when we deal in similitudes, and make
application by this word Thus, or So, there is only a likeness to be
understood: but in all Problemes, and School-Disputes, in all quotations and
repetitions, it is used to signify the same thing in terms to which it is
annexed. Thus when in the Philosopher we read (...), and when we repeat
Syllogismes, with a sic disputas, we do or ought to respect the very terms: and
thus a good Grammarian tells Pasor. (...).
us of the word, Si Logicum spectes usum, it is (not a redditionis) a note of
Repetition; and a disputant may be justly displeased if ye alter his terms, and
will tell you, nonsic, sed sic argumentatus sum, I did not dispute so, that is,
in your words, but so, that is, in my own: and in this sense the word is
interpreted by most judicious Expositors, as signifying not, after this manner,
(as our Translation paraphraseth it,) but (which it will better bear,) in this
form, and in these words: which Interpretation is warranted from the use of it
in that signification in the Scriptures both of the Old and New Testament. Thus
when Aaron and his sons were commanded, On this wise ye shall bless the people,
the word is (...) Numb. 6. 23.
which the Septuagint render (...); and I am assured that the Priests kept to
the very words of that Benediction; and whether they should not have offended
if they had done otherwise, is to be considered. Maimonides, in his More
Neuochim, More Neuochim per Buxtorf. p. 108.
upon the words (Sic benedicetis (i.) (says he) hac lingua, in this very
language; but there is no necessity of understanding them so strictly, only
it shows they were far from varying the form: And questionless they did, and
might, with more faith and better success retain and use this, and Numb. 10.
35. Deuteronomy. 21. 7, 8. 26. 13. Hos. 14. 2. Joel 2. 7.
several other forms that were commanded them under this or a like expression,
then if they had varied them into any other words whatsoever. If you or I
should command a servant to deliver a message to a superior, and put words in
his mouth, in oyning him to say thus, or if you will, after this manner; I trow
we think so well of our own expressions, and know our own case, and the
quality of the person to whom we send so well, that we should censure that
servant as guilty of high presumption, who should purt osely lay aside all our
expressions, which he might very well have remembered, and deliver our message
in words of his own framing; nor are such servants like to mend the matter: and
therefore it is every where obvious in Scripture, that the messengers of great
and holy men, Kings and Prophets, have delivered their Embassy in the same
words they received it; and it would have been an act of disobedience, and an
argument of pride, to have altered matter, method and form; and yet this is
done to our Saviors injunction, by all those who neither say this, nor thus.
When God sent Moses to the children of Israel, he commanded him, Thus shall
thou say unto the Exodus 3. 14. Chapter 4. 30.
children of Israel; and the Text says, Moses told Aaron all the words, and
Aaron spoke all the words which the Lord had spoken unto Moses. So in the New
Testament, when our Savior sent two of his Disciples to bring him a Colt, he
commanded them, if any should ask them why they loosed the Colt, (...), Thus
shall ye say unto them, The Lord has need of him: such an Luke 19. 31.
answer might seem very unsatisfactory to the owner; and yet we find they say
neither more nor less, (though their safety were at stake) then what they were
in express words commanded; and therefore it cannot well be presumed that they
made any variation here, where the word of injunction Ver. 34.
is the same, and the matter of a greater importance: and so lastly, when any
Sentence is quoted out of the Old Testament in the New, in the same terms. The
holy Penmen make ^se of this Word, which also the Apostle parallels with (...);
what says the Law? and (...), it Romans 10. 6, 8.
speaks thus: And the (...) what, and (...), how, are both used in one sense,
and (...) answers to both: And when in any of our writeings Luke 10. 26.
or sayings we quote the authority of learned men, with a Sic dixit Aristot.
Augustine. etc. we should be unfaithful did we not deliver their very words in
their own language, or as near as we can translate them in ours.

There is also somewhat considerable in the word (...) as joined with (...),
Thus Sect. 16.
pray ye. Our Savior does not say, look to this copy, frame your Prayers after
this example, but when you actually pray, Pray thus; which is the same with St.
Lukes (...), Pray or say, Our Father; Pray or say, Hallowed be thy Name; for
although the (...) should be of a larger extent in its proper notion, and like
the materia prima be capable of all forms, yet being here limited to the act of
Praying, and the act determined by a certain form, the (...) has now received
its principle of individuation; and as (...), when it respects a person is of
the same signification with (...), so is (...) respecting a certain thing, of
the same signification, as if our Savior had said, (...) (i.) Pray ye, in
these words.

And when our Savior delivers an entire, Sect. 17.
uninterrupted Form of Prayer, and immediately subjoyns a brief rational upon
what seemed most harsh and obscure in it, (for if ye Matthew. 6. 14, 15.
forgive, etc. But if ye forgive not, etc.) This is to me a good Argument, that
that Prayer ought to be used by us without any addition or alteration, pro hic
and nunc, at certain times and occasions, which he himself would not dismember
by any Parenthesis or Exposition of his own. But last of al, supposing the word
(...) did signify only (after this manner, or to this purpose,) yet doubtless
there is no danger in using the very words also; whereas on the contrary, if it
were our Saviors intention that we should say these words, (as the Church of
God have practiced, and the best Expositors in all ages have understood it;)
there is then a certain fault in those that slight and omit them: So that there
will lie more then an appearance of evil upon the dissenters, but none at all
upon the practices; and we know who has 1 These. 5. 22. Bernard ad Eugenium;
lib. 3. de Consid. c. 4.
commanded us to abstain from all appearance of evil; Quicquid est male
coloratum, says Saint Bernard, whatever has any show or tincture of sin and
disobedience. This for the words of prescription in Saint Matthew.

But now when our Savior was desired by his Sect. 18.
Disciples, in Saint Luke, to teach them to pray as John taught his Disciples,
respecting the manner and form as well as the matter; and our Savior in
compliance with their desires; gives them a complete form, and plainly injoyns
them without a thus, or after this manner, although that be plain enough too,
to say, (1.) totident verbis, in express words, Our Father: I must needs say,
says judicious Hooker, that the Opinion of Hookers Polity.
some, who affirm that our Savior did set his Disciples a bare example to
contrive and devise Prayers of their own, and no way bind them to use his, is
undoubtedly an error. And Master Perkins is not far from his opinion; Whereas,
faith Perkins on the Lords Prayer.
he, sundry men in our Church, hold it unlawful to use this very form of words,
as they are set down by our Savior Christ for a Prayer; they are far deceived:
and in answer to a third Objection, which is, That the pattern to make all
Prayers by, should not be used as a Prayer: I answer, says Master Perkins,
that therefore the rather it may be used as a Prayer; and sure it is, that
ancient and worthy Divines have reverenced it as a Prayer, choosing rather to
use these words then any other; as Cyprian, Tertullian, and Augustine:
wherefore, says he, that opinion is full of ignorance and error: And I may
add, if the opinion be full the practice cannot be empty.

And indeed, as Master Mede and Master Hodges say, what more significant
expression, supposing it had been our Saviors mind to enjoin it as a form,
could be fitted or contrived to intimate it to his Disciples then this, when ye
pray, say, etc. Or had our Savior foreseen the controversies that would arise
in these last days concerning the use of it (and doubtless he did foresee them
all) how could he more positively have decided them then by this plain
expression, when ye pray, say? Suppose this had been the sense of the Disciples
in this place asking a Prayer, as some learned men conceive it was, Lord, thou
gave us a Prayer in the Mount, but whether that was intended for public use
or no, we are not fully satisfied; wherefore now we beseech thee teach us such
a one as John also taught his Disciples; what more punctual answer could be
devised then this, when ye pray, say, etc?

Such as dissent from this opinion and practice, finding themselves overborn by
the weight of Sect. 19.
this expression in Saint Luke, are wont to retreat to that of Saint Matthew,
by whom they plead Saint Luke ought to be expounded; to which if we should give
way, as it would not much help them, (that fortress having declared already for
the contrary opinion;) so I doubt not but we may easily block up all avenues to
that refuge, and evince by sufficient Arguments, that Saint Luke should rather
expound Saint Matthew, then be expounded by him.

For seeing it is true, as many learned men do Chemnitius Luc. Brugen. Paraeus,
etc. Mede.
affirm, that our Savior did twice deliver this form, and the Disciples not
fully apprehending it at first to be intended for public use, he repeats the
same form a second time under a more plain injunction; this signifies he
intended it so in Saint Matthew, and his second injunction is but a more solemn
sanction of it as a form for public use; and that it was twice delivered
appears partly from what Master Mede says; that it is impossible to make these
two relations of the Evangelists to be coincident for time; and the different
occasion heightens the impossibility: Marlorate makes this of Saint Luke to
agree with another passage of Saint Matthew, Chapter 14. 23. where our Savior
is said to go into a Mountain apart to pray; and so here in Saint Luke, He
prayed, and that alone or apart; so that the coincidency of these two places is
far more probable then the other: For this Prayer of St. Matthew was delivered
in the first year, says Chemnitius; in the second year of our Saviors
Ministry, says Master Mede, this of Saint Luke in the third year; in all
probability there was more then the distance of a complete year; whereas by
the general consent of Harmonists that of the 14. of Mat. is much more
coincident in time, and the occasion seems one and the same; only Saint
Matthew, having recorded this Prayer before, passes it by here; and Saint Luke
omitting it in the Sermon on the mount, where Saint Matthew had recorded it,
repeats it here, where Saint Matthew had omitted it: for all know that is the
usual manner of the Evangelists, as to repeat that more briefly which the
former had enlarged, so to enlarge that more fully which the other did but
touch, or pretermitted; which double Sanction as it is a good Argument to prove
that Christ intended it for a form, so it does also strongly infer that which I
intend, that the injunction in Saint Luke is the most express and plain; unless
we should affirm that our Savior did make things more perplexed and obscure by
his often repetition of them: and being most express and plain, it ought
certainly to expound that which is more dark and doubtful, unless, contrary to
the Rules of all good method, we will teach ignotum per ignotius, which is as
to make the blind lead the lame. And seeing all Expositors do grant, that Saint
Luke is most exact in the orderly disposing of things according to their time,
and relating their occasions, it will still follow (although we should grant
the places of both Evangelists to be for time coincident) that Saint Luke, who
records the occasion more fully, and the injunction more plainly, ought to
expound Saint Matthew, and not to be expounded by him; and so we see Saint
Matthewes sic has its sicut in Saint Luke, After this manner pray ye, is of
the same force, as, when ye pray say, etc.

Doubtless our Savior could express his mind Sect. 20.
so appositely, and foresee all inconveniences so clearly, that had it been his
mind that his Disciples should not have used this Prayer as a form, or that
their successors should offend in so doing, he would have propounded it with
some caution or limitation; either he would not have made it a form, or being
such, he would not have commended it unto them under such an apparent
injunction, as when ye pray, say, etc. (which sounds quite contrary to such an
intent) for in this sense it has been understood, and accordingly practiced by
the Church in all Ages; and any vulgar eye that vieweth the whole structure may
observe that it was fitted by our Savior for public Devotion, to be used by
his Disciples in consort, and to serve as a note of distinction to such as
heard them whose Disciples they were. And Doctor Hammonds Paraphrase most
genuinely agrees with the Text: One of his Disciples besought him to give them
a form of Prayer which they might constantly use, as John Baptist had given to
his Disciples; and upon that demand of his, being at another time, and upon
another occasion from that in the Sermon on the Mount, Christ said to his
Disciples, Whenever ye pray solemnly omit not to use this form Matthew. 6.
of words. For if Saint John's Disciples did publicly use the form of Prayer
given them by their Master; and the (...) be as much as (...), si quando, if at
any time ye will pray, so as to be known that ye are my Disciples; what can
this signify less then, when ye pray solemly omit not to use this form of
words?

Master Hodges his Argument has also its Sect. 21.
weight, and may be improved thus; Suppose the Disciples had asked, Master,
teach us to sing as David taught the people of God; or, which is the same,
teach us to pray, as David taught the People of God, (for he taught them
Psalms of Prayer as well as Praise, and hereupon our Savior had composed some
Psalms of Praise and Prayer; I demand, whether we should not have been obliged
to use those Hymns of Prayer and Praise, although there had been no injunction
annexed to them: And doubtless, as the people of God under the Old Testament,
and we under the New, ought to use David's Hymns of Prayer and Praise, as an
Ordinance of God in his public Worship; so ought we more especially, and at
least as frequently, to use this most solemn and Divine form of Prayer. And
thus of the Arguments from the words of injunction, whereof this is a Sylloge:

1. The injunction of Saint Matthew is sufficiently clear to all unprejudiced
persons.

2. That of Saint Luke, delivered a second time, and on a different occasion,
has yet (as the dissenters grant) a more clear command; by which

3. That of Saint Matthew (if there had been any difficulty in it) ought to be
interpreted.

4. There cannot be a more apposite expression given to signify that it ought
to be used as a form.

And fifthly, had our Savior intended it only as a Pattern or heads for
Prayer, or foreseen any inconvenience in the use of it as a form, he would
never have commended it under such words, as in the judgment of the Church,
and eminent servants of God in all ages, has the full import of a positive
injunction, When ye pray, say.

The next thing to be considered, is the matter of fact, what has been the
practice of the Disciples, Sect. 22.
of the Church of God, and of pious and learned Christians in all ages. And
although it be no where in Scripture set down positively, that the Apostles did
use this form of words, as neither that they did use the same method or matter;
yet this being but a negative argument, concludes no more that they did not use
this form of Prayer, then, because we read not that they baptized any In the
Name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, therefore they did not
so baptize any; which form was yet enjoined by our Savior, as a prime Office
of their Ministry, and beyond all peradventure they did strictly observe as
often as they baptized any. And when the Scripture assures us, that it was their
practice to use Psalms and Hymns, and spiritual songs, praising God, and
praying unto him in the words of David, when they did keep to the same
prescibed words in the administration of both Sacraments, when they observed
forms in the benediction of the people, in the close of their Epistles, and in
other solemn Acts of Gods worship; (all of which forms were not so authentic
as to be of our Saviors own composure and prescription) what should hinder but
that they might and did use this most excellent form of Prayer in their
devotion? Most certain it is, that they who retain a form of Benediction over
the people when they dismiss them, and of administration of both Sacraments,
have no more to say in their defense, then they who retain and use this form of
Prayer; for Christ who gave commission to his Disciples to go and discipline
all Nations, baptizing them, etc. He that said, Take, eat, this is my body,
etc. the same commanded also as positively, when ye pray, say, etc. And when we
all account it our duty to praise God in singing David's Psalms, some of which,
as we use them, are of a mean composure, and carry expressions beneath the
Majesty of Scripture; others, such as concerned the Jewish Church only; why
ought not the Apostles, and we as necessarily, to use this form of Prayer,
sanctified by our Saviors own lips? Can we charitably think they asked a
Prayer, in sense of their own insufficiency for that duty, and such a one as by
the use thereof they might be known to be his Disciples, and when they obtained
one so heavenly, so succinct, and yet so significant, and enjoined under such
plain terms, yet did refuse or neglect to use it? doubtless, they did bestow
some time to commit it to memory, they did often con it and meditate upon it;
and when they repeated it, I suppose it was not without some affection,
devotion, and lifting up their souls to God; and if so, they did use it as a
form of Prayer.

And surely that of Saint Augustine may take Aug. de Bapt. contra Donat. lib.
2. c. 7. and lib. 4. c. 24.
take place here if any where; Quod universa tenet Ecclesia, etc. In practical
matters the use whereof is obscure, the general practice of the Church is the
best Interpreter. His rule is this; That which the universal Church does hold,
not as being instituted by Councels, but as always retained in the Church, we
rightly believe it to be of Apostolical authority: Now indeed the Councels did
often check the neglect, and determine Conc. Gerun. Toletan.
the times and order of using it, but never imposed it de novo, as a thing that
had not been formerly practiced. Quia quotidiana Oration est quotidie dici
oportet, says the Toletan Counel; Because it respects our daily needs, it
ought to be said daily.

Nothing can be more certainly affirmed from Sect. 23.
Ecclesiastical Records concerning any matter of fact, then that the Church of
Christ did early and constantly use this form as a chief part of their
devotion: That (...), One Common Ignatius ubi supra.
Prayer used in the time of Ignatius, who saw Christ in the flesh, it was in
all probability this, or some other form.

Genebrard in his Chronol. tells us of a School at Lib. 3. p. 511. Anno 196.
Hier. in Catal.
Alexandria, wherein Saint Mark had appointed that there should be continually
such Doctors as should teach the Fundamentals of Christian Religion; he names
Pantenus, who lived under Commodus the Emperor, Clemens Alexandrinus, and
Origin; and he says from Tertullian Tertul. lib. 5. contr. Marcion. and
Socrates Hist. ubi supra.
and Socrates, that in this School were taught the Creed, the Decalogue, and
the Lords Prayer; Saint Hieromes authority you have had already: So Christ
taught his Apostles, says he, that they should constantly at the Sacrament of
his body say, Our Father, and accordingly they desire, etc. repeating the whole
Prayer. The next testimony is Tertullians, Praemissa legitima and ordinaria
precatione quasi fundamento, jus est desideriorum, Tertul. de Oratione, c. 1.
jus est super struendi extrinsecus petitiones; Having first said the lawful
and ordinary prayer as a foundation, we make it the rule of our desires, and of
framing all our Petitions according to it. He calls it lawful, as appointed in
the Gospel by the Law of Christ; and being ordinary, it is an Argument that the
general use of it had prevailed through ancient custom in more Primitive
times: and that Father is large in the commendation of it, calling it.
Breviarium totius Evangelii, a breviary of the whole Gospel, which is not more
succinct in words, then it is enlarged in matter, comprehending not only all
the Offices of prayer, but all the sayings of Christ.

If any credit may be given to the Clementine Clement. Constitutiones per
Surium lib. 7. c. 25. cap. 45.
Constitutions, it was of ordinary use even in Apostolical times: They naming
the Lords Prayer, add, Ad hunc modum precamini ter singulis diebus, use this
Prayer three times a day: and again, Let the baptized person standing up, say
the Prayer which the Lord has taught us.

Gregory being asked why he did annex the Gregor. Mag. l. 7. Epist. 54.
Lords prayer to the Canon for celebration of the Lords Supper, gives this
reason; Mos fuit Apostolorum, ut ad ipsam solummodo Orationem Dominicam, etc.
It was the practice of the Apostles to consecrate the Holy Sacrament only by
the Lords prayer. And indeed the many Comments and pious Expositions of this
prayer, in all So August. Epist. 59. ad Paulinum.
those Primitive times of the Church, by their chiefest Doctors, is to me an
argument, of its ordinary use: and were those Expositions collected into one
volume, and well digested, it might prove as great a help to devotion as any
that I know. But I may easily tire my Reader, leading him only through a few
of those many ancient paths, where evident footsteps of the common and frequent
use of this Prayer do appear: as in those most ancient Liturgies collected by
Bignius and George Cassander, many of which Bignii Biblioth. tom. 6. Georg.
Cassan. de Liturg.
are for the chief parts of them, and as far as concerns the matter in hand
authentic, though in other things they have suffered additions and
alterations; in these generally this prayer is inserted sometimes more then
once: thus in those that bare the names of Saint Mark, Saint James,
Chrysostom, and Basil his Greek Liturgy, and that which he translated out of
the Syriack, the Ethiopian, Armenian, and the Roman, before the defection of
that Church, in all these this prayer is used; and Master Hooker has observed,
That what part of the world soever we fall into, if Christian Religion have
been there received, Ecclesiast. Polity li. 5.
the ordinary use of this very prayer has with equal continuance accompanied
the same, as one of the principal and most material duties of honor done to
Jesus Christ. Saint Augustine makes August. ad Laurentium.
many memorials of the use of it, as in his Enchiridion, Ecce tibi est Symbolum
and oration Dominica, etc. You have the Creed and the Lords prayer, what shorter
rule is heard or read, or more easily committed to memory? And again, They that
walk in the ways of the Lord, say, Forgive us our trespasses: and again, the
daily prayer which Concio 3. in Psalm. 18 De civit. Dei, l. 21. c. 27.
the Lord himself taught, (whence it is called the Lords prayer,) does obtain
pardon for daily sins: And speaking of the prayer used at the administration of
the Sacrament, he says, Which prayer almost all the Church concludes with the
Lords prayer; we cannot pray for any thing else, says See also Epist. 1 21. b.
12.
he, seeing whatever may be desired of God, this one prayer taught by Christ
does contain, and all in that order as it ought to be desired; so that this
prayer is to be preferred above all, as for brevity of words, so for plenty of
things, and their orderly disposure. And that diligent and devout Father has
diverse entire Comments upon it. I shall add only one saying more of his; Si
Hom. 42.
quis vestrum non poterit tenere perfect, audiendo quotidie tenebit; If any of
you have not learned it perfectly, by hearing it daily he may.

Saint Ambrose on the fifteenth Petition of this Ambrosius in Orat. Dom. p. 54.
tom. 5.
prayer says thus; Therefore daily say this Petition, that thou may daily
obtain pardon for thy debt: And again, Let us hear what the Disciple of Christ
does pray, namely, that which his master taught him; Hear, says he, what the
Priest See p. 265 tomi. 51.
says, Through Jesus Christ, in whom, and with whom, unto thee be honor,
praise and glory: This was a clause added by the Latin Church to our Lords
prayer instead of the Doxology, of which more hereafter.

Saint Cyprian is most excellent in the commendation Cyprian de Orat. Dom.
of this prayer, and the use of it as a form; his words are these: seeing this
prayer was breathed forth from God our Savior, what can be more acceptable,
what more effectual with God the Father? what should be more dear and familiar
to us? Lest thou should be ignorant how God is to be spoken to, God himself
puts words into thy mouth; and lest thou should doubt how ready he is to
hear thy prayers, he himself directs thee how to pray in such a manner as is
fit to be heard; and lest thou should complain that (a form of prayer being
prescribed) thou have lost thy liberty of asking the things thou need,
whatever things thou might rightly desire, are all included; and our Savior
has included them in a prayer, that gives us so great honor, that raises us
to so great hope, that flows with so much sweetness, as no tongue can express;
and it is to be wished the understanding of the supplicant could aspire
thereunto: Let us therefore pray, beloved brethren, (as he goes on) as God our
Master has taught us; it is a friendly and familiar Prayer, to entreat God in
his own words, when the Prayer of Christ shall ascend from our mouths to the
ears of God; the Father will own the Sons words, when we pray unto him in them;
if whatever we ask in his Sons Name he will give us, how much more
effectually John 16. 23.
shall we obtain if we ask in Christ's Name by his Prayer? Thus Saint Cyprian.
Lucas Brugensis Brugensis Annot.
speaking of the manner of saying the Lords Prayer in the Latin Church, says,
it was so ab istis Apostolorum temporibus, from the Apostles days.

Saint Chrysostom does record it as a Rule of the Church, (which we have
already mentioned Homil. 20. on Matthew.
out of the Clementine Constitutions, and by this of Saint Chrysostom it
receives a further confirmation,) that the baptized person should say the
Lords Prayer; from which custom he proves, against the Heretics of his time,
that the People of God were not by Baptism secured from falling into sin, nor
were they excluded from all hope of remission, if they did repent for the sins
which were committed after Baptism; seeing that the Church does not teach them
in vain presently upon that Ordinance to say, Forgive us our trespasses.

In the Canons of King Canut under Aethelnoth, this is one: Moreover, we exhort
that every Sr. H. Spelman. Conc. Britt. Reg. 22.
Christian do so learn as that he well understand the true Faith, and have the
Lords prayer, and the Apostles Creed familiar; for Christ himself did first
teach that prayer, and gave it to his Disciples; and he that will not learn
these shall never partake of happiness with Christians when he dies, not living
shall be admitted to the Eucharist, nor shall he be counted worthy the name of
a Christian. I shall add but one testimony more, and that (for antiquities
sake) from the mouth of an heathen, namely Lucian the Scoffer, who in his
Philopatris purposely derides the doctrine and practices of Christians; he
names our Savior Chrestus, by way of contempt; he calls his scholar by the
word used in the Primitive Church, (...), one that is to be catechized: He sets
down the Doctrine of the Trinity, as it was then taught, One in Three, and
Three Socinus in defens. Anim ad. cont. Gabriel. Eutropium.
in One, (which expression of his is acknowledged by Socinus to be so fair an
evidence for the Doctrine of the Trinity, that he says, he never read any
thing more strong:) He describes the Creation, and Moses; St. Paul, and the
Sacrament of Baptism; and at last bespeaks Critias, that personated a young
Christian disciple, thus; But let these alone, and go say thy Prayer, (...),
Beginning with Father, and adding that famous Doxologie. This Rigaltius on
Tertullian notes, that the Pagan meant it of the Lords prayer; and it is
brought by the learned Mr. Gregory, to prove against the Papists, that the
Doxologie is authentic; and he that considers the design of that left-witted
heathen, cannot devise what else he should mean: And if so, it appears that it
was the frequent practice of Christians in Lucians days, (that is, in the time
of Trajan, less then two hundred years after it was delivered by Christ) to use
this form of Prayer publicly: for how else could this Pagan come to the
knowledge of it, or scoffingly enjoin it as a duty to be performed by him that
would become a Christian? And now let it be considered, whence had these most
Primitive times this custom of using and injoyning our Lords prayer, if not
(as they do all testify uno ore, with one consent) from the practice of the
Apostles, as they had it from the precept of Christ? He must bring some
convincing Argument, or Demonstration, that will disprove all these Evidences;
and until that be done, we may safely acquiesce in these.

If I should now add the authorities and opinions Sect. 24.
of modern Divines, whose names and memories are, and ever will be, fresh and
fragrant in all the reformed Church, I should far exceed my intended limits: I
shall therefore mention only the most eminent, and them chiefly who are of
greatest repute with the dissenters. And Calv. Institut. l. 3. c. 20. S. 34.
first, Mr. Calvin says; Now not only a more certain rule, but the very form
it self of prayer is to be taught: and again, for Christ prescribed us a form.
And as this prayer was used in the Geneva Liturgy, so frequently by Mr. Calvin
himself, at or before his Homilies.

And Beza became his scholar in this also; for Beza's Annot. on Luke 11.
he says, Our Lords Prayer is precum formula divinitus nobis quasi
praeseriptis verbis mandata, A form of prayer commanded unto us from heaven as
it were in prescribed words. Next, Chemnitius Chemn. Har. p. 1175.
in his Harmony says, That the Disciples desired of Christ, after the example
of St. John, a certain form of prayer which they might use in their devotion,
and by which they might the more easily obtain what they desired.

Again, we know that when we recite the Lords Prayer we enjoy a great
privilege, seeing that he who taught us sits in heaven the Master of our
requests; who also presents our prayers, and intercedes for us: Cum primis vero
illud notatu dignum est (as he says) This especially ought to be observed,
That when Christ in the first year of his Ministry had taught his Disciples
how to pray; and here again, being desired to teach them to pray, taught no new
form, but repeated the old; it shows, we should not be troubled every day
about new forms, nor that our prayers are therefore unacceptable, (other
requisites being observed) because we repeat the same form; for (as he quoteth
from St. Augustine) All the prayers of the Saints are nothing else but the
Pater noster, etc. enlarged, and in it is comprised the marrow of all the
prayers of the old Testament; and hence (says he) the word (Collect) is used
to signify a prayer, this prayer being a collection of all good prayers that
ever were made in the world.

Mr. Thomas Cartwright says; I know in so Bishop whitgifts defense. p. 804.
few words it is impossible for any man to frame so pithie a prayer; only
there is no necessity laid on us to use this and no more: (where he seems to
grant a necessity of using this:) and again, I confess the Church does well in
concluding their prayers with the Lords prayer.

And indeed the use of it has been preserved in all famous Liturgies of the
Reformed Churches, as well Lutheran as Calvinists; in that which was composed
by the English exiles at Frankefort in the Marian days, and printed at Geneva,
1556. it is twice inserted.

But of all Champions, Pareus has most succesfully Pareus on Matthew. 6.
defended it: Seeing (says he) this prayer is read in two different places, it
is made a question whether it was twice delivered; and I see nothing to the
contrary but it was prescribed twice, once in the mount to the Disciples and
people, another time to the Disciples alone: to which opinion the different
occasions in Matthew and Luke do persuade me; for it seems the Disciple who in
Luke demanded a prayer, was not present at the Sermon on the Mount, or the form
first given was forgotten; for the Disciples were ignorant, sua ruditate, for
their dullness, of some things which were twice or thrice delivered to them.
Then it may be demanded (says he,) whether our Savior did so strictly oblige
us to this form and words, as that we may not use any other: thish e deservedly
denies, (using St. Augustines distinction, viz. we may pray aliter, or aliis
verbis, in other forms, and words, but we cannot pray for aliud, any other
thing then what is included in these words) but yet he says, both to public
and private prayers we do rightly add this form, as a seal of them. For which
he gives these reasons:

1. That we may obey the command of the Son of God.

2. Pareus his Reasons for using our Lords Prayer in public and private.
Because it may not be doubted, but these words of prayer are most acceptable
to our heavenly Father; for the Father ever hears the Son, therefore he
will hear the Sons words.

3 Because it most succinctly contains a perfect sum of all things desirable,
so that in whatever particular our own prayers have been defective, this form
will make a supply.

4. This prayer is granted as an encouragement to those who are yet more slow
and ignorant, that the Son of God has instructed them how to the prayers of
the Church they should join their own, in this short form.

Thus Pareus; and our Assembly in their works have done worthily on this
behalf: In their Catechism they have this question, How is the Lords prayer to
be used? The answer is, The Lords prayer is not only for direction, as a
pattern according to which we are to make our prayers, but may also be used as
a prayer, so that it be done with understanding, reverence, faith, and other
gifts necessary to the right performance of the duty of prayer. More fully yet
in their Directory; The prayer which Christ taught his Disciples, is not only a
pattern of prayer, but it self a most comprehensive prayer: Therefore we
recommend it to be used in the prayers of the Church. And above and beyond this
is that which is delivered by them in the large Annotations: This is a true
sum On Matt. 6 9.
and form of all Christian prayer, set down both in precept and practice. And
on Luke 11. 2. When ye pray; Compare (say they) Matthew 6. 9. and the
circumstances show, that Christ did twice at least teach them the very form of
prayer; and hence it appears, that as this is the most absolute and complete
pattern of prayer, comprehending all that we must ask; so is it the most exact
and sacred form of prayer, indicted and taught his Disciples (who were to teach
the whole world the rules and practice of true Religion) by Christ himself,
who is best able to teach his Disciples to pray.

Again, on the word (Say) Christ prescribed this form of prayer to his
Disciples to be used by them, not rejecting others which his spirit taught, or
teaches; (That is, as I suppose, other forms, which the Spirit did, or might
teach) but to abridge all necessary petitions into this one sum. Thus that
grave Assembly. And Dr. Hammond View of the Directory, p. 28.
tells us, he heard one of the gravest members of it, being asked concerning
the use of the Lords Prayer, to answer thus; God forbid I should ever be upon
my knees in prayer, and rise up without adding Christ's form to my imperfect
petitions. So that even they who reject other forms of prayer, think it fit to
retain this. And what pity is it when the General Assembly teach it so well to
others, any particular members should make it a castaway in their own practice?

The Dutch Annotations say thus: Order all Matthew. 6. 9
your prayers according to this form; not that we are bound always, or only,
to hese words, f in necessities that may fallout, it is also lawful farther to
enlarge some petitions, and also to express them in other words. Junius on
Matthew thus; Substantiam orationis, etc. Christ taught the substance of
prayer, in that most holy form which is observed in the Church: and in the
notes with Tremelius on Luke 11. It is probable that John did compose a certain
prayer out of diverse places of Scripture, which agreed to the time, and came
near to the spiritual Kingdom of Christ that was to be revealed.

Lucas Brugensis on the word (Say) Use this form, which being extracted out of
the holy Scripture contains the sum of all petitions: and it is Luc. Brugen.
on Luke 11.
no wonder if Christ did repeat this most perfect form, not twice only, but
more often, which he would have his Disciples use daily.

Bishop Andrews speaking of Prayer, says; And in this also we want not
fancies (in this age Bishop Andrews of worshipping Imaginations, p. 36
especially) wherein an idle conceit is taken up, that never came into the
heads of any of the old heretics, though never so brainsick, once to imagine;
Our Savior Christ thus wills us, when ye pray, say, Our Father, etc. A most
fond imagination is start up in our times, never once dreamed of before, that
tells us in no case we must say, Our Father; with which form, (if Saint
Augustine be to be believed as a witness of Antiquity,) Epist. 5.
the Universal Church of Christ has ever used to begin and end all her
prayers; as striving indeed to express the sense of that prayer, but not being
able to come nigh the high art, and most excellent spirit of perfection in that
pattern, they always conclude with it; as being sure, however they may for
diverse defects not attain to the depth of it, by it they shall be sure to beg
all things necessary at Gods hands.

Bishop Usher in his body of Divinity, to the p. 352.
Question, What is the Lords prayer? Answers, It is an absolute prayer in it
self, a prayer giving perfect direction to frame all other prayers by. And
again; it is a prayer which we may and ought to pray. See Baldwines Cases of
Conscience. Maresius Lib. 2. c. 7. Cas. 13.
says, Christ did not only present us with an Idea, but a Form of prayer,
when to his Disciples asking him, Teach us to pray, he answered, when ye pray,
say, etc. Alsted says, The Lords prayer is Theol. proph. p. 700.
the breviary of the Gospel; therefore with this form of prayer especially God
is to be invocated. Mr. Ball says, To refuse this form savoureth of a Ball on
the Lords Prayer, p. ult. Ravenelun verb. Oration Dom. Sect. 25.
proud contempt of Christ's Ordinance. Ravenella from Tertullian tells us, It is
that new form of prayer which Christ has determined for the Disciples of the
New Testament.

Here are Champions sufficient; and yet to these we might call in, if need
were, (and those no foreign forces neither) the votes of all those National
Churches, and famous Persons, which have both practiced and pleaded for, not
this form only, but the use of other forms of far inferior rank; and I have
not yet heard or seen their Arguments or practice disproved by any. The
Albingenses, Waldenses, Lutherans generally, the Protestants of France,
Denmark, Swethland, Helvetia, both Germanies, Geneva and Franckefort;
Wickliff, Hus, Luther, Melanchton, Calvine, Bucer, Phagius, Cranmer, Latimer,
Ridley, Bradford, Hooper, Tailor, (almost an army of Martyrs;) Fox, Dr. John
Reynolds, Burges, Greenham, Baines, Hildersham, Perkins, Preston, Ball, Sibi,
Dod, with many others: all which being confessedly the Luminaries of their
several Generations, have given light to the lawfulness, and consent and liking
to the use of forms in general, and much more of this in particular. For if
forms of prayer have been approved by all these, then questionless this which
is the rule and standard of all, (and is disliked chiefly, if not only, for its
being a form) was approved above all.

And if its being a form, or our using it as such, be a fault, both these may
be charged on our Saviors Sect. 26.
account, who yet knew no sin, though he used diverse forms: and why we should
be such professed enemies to what our Savior declared himself so much a
friend, (especially if we consider how much the forms used by him were beneath
that which he commanded us) I fear a satisfactory reason can be scarcely given.
Nay, when we do the same thing in other parts of Gods Worship, why should we
disallow our selves in this? The Scriptures which we read are forms; There are
forms of Doctrine, and forms of wholesome words, forms of praising God, and
praying unto him in the words of Abraham, Jacob, Moses, Deborah, David,
Solomon, Hezekiah, etc. and when we may and ought to bless and praise God in
some of these forms, why ought we not also to pray unto God in this? It seems
forms are lawful in our praises, in the administration of both Sacraments, in
our benedictions, yea and our excommunications too, only in our prayers they
are not so. And is not this greatly to be wondered at, that in our Generation
men should so much dote upon, and contend for petty forms of Discipline, which
till of late days were never fancied to be either in the Scriptures of God, or
the practice of his Church; for which notwithstanding the veil of the Temple,
yea the very bowels of the Church, are rent, and Christ himself seems to be
crucified afresh; when this form, so positively prescribed in Scripture, so
universally practiced by the Church in all ages, is most undeservedly and
unworthily exploded?

Our Saviors own practice was a sufficient warrant for the Primitive Church to
compose and make use of forms of Prayer in the public worship of God; and that
promise of his (which also implies a precept) was a firm ground of raising
their faith and hope of obtaining a blessing on them: I say unto you, that if
two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall Matthew.
18. 9.
ask, it shall be done for them, etc. And indeed it will require the serious
study, experience, wisdom, and premeditation of more then one Disciple, to
express the necessities of all the people of God, and suit them to the
capacities and affections of them all.

And now having already given you a series of Sect. 27.
the use of forms in the service of God under the Old Testament, and seeing the
use of this prayer is disliked chiefly because it is a form, I am even
necessitated to say somewhat of the use of forms also under the New: And, that
they that seek a stumbling block may find none, I shall choose to do it in the
words of pious and approved men, who are above all exception: And such an one
in the first place I take Mr. Calvin to be, who in his Epistle to the then
Protector of Call. Epistles, October. 22 1548.
England says thus; As for forms of Prayer, and Ecclesiastical rites, I
greatly approve that there be set forms, from which the Pastors may not depart
in their offices, and whereby provision will be made to assist the simplicity
and indiscretion of some; and the consent of all Churches may more visibly
appear; and it will prove a remedy against the desultory levity of some men
that still affect innovations: as I have showed (says he) that the Catechism
it self serves for this purpose; so therefore there ought to be a set form of
Catechism, a set form of the administration of the Sacraments, and of public
prayer.

The worst that Mr. Calvine said of the English Liturgy (when it was newly
purged from the dross of Popery) being importuned by some dissenting English at
Franckfort to pass his censure upon it, was this, that the things most obvious
to exception were tolerabiles ineptiae, trifles that might be tolerated, rather
then contended about: and his toleration of the worst implies his approbation
of the rest. Upon one of these grounds the heathen themselves made use of
forms, (which indeed were grown more universal then the Church her self,) ne
forte aliquid praepostere dicatur, Alex. ab Alex. l. 4. c. 7.
lest any unfit thing should be spoken, they read their Prayers before their
sacrifices out of a book. And in truth, as at the building of the Temple there
was no noise of axes and hammers 1 King. 6. 7
heard, but all the materials were hewed and formed before hand; so in the
public service of God we should use all lawful means to secure our selves from
those weaknesses, indecencies, and miscarriages, to which we are all subject.

Marosius tells us, that adstata pietas officia, System. p. 305.
etc. It is both lawful and expedient in the constant duties of Piety, as well
private as public, to use preconceived forms, whereby both the mind and tongue
may be guided in the performance: for this (says he) was the constant practice
of the Church Numb. 6. 23. 2 Chronicles. 7. 6. 29. 30*
in all ages, and grounded upon most firm testimonies of Scripture.

Next, Alsted says, That certain forms of prayer have been always used in
the Church; and Theol. Catech. p. 683.
although to pray in a right manner be a gift of the holy Ghost, (tamen
formulae precum divinitus praescriptae, etc.) yet forms of prayer which are by
divine prescription are not to be neglected; as the precepts of living well are
not therefore to be despised, because the holy Spirit does work Holiness in us.

Bishop Andrews reproves an imagination against (Orabo Spiritu) praying in the
Spirit, 1 Cor. 14. 15. Of worshipping Imaginations. p. 37.
by finding fault with a fit Liturgy, which they call stinted Prayers; and
giving themselves to imagine Prayers at the same instant; whereby it is plain,
they so occupy their minds with devising what to say next, that their spirit is
unfruitful, no less then the others understanding: and both the understanding
of the mind, and the affection of the spirit, are there necessarily required.

And again, St. Cyprian says, It was ever in Christ's Church counted an absurd
thing, ventilari precs inconditis vocibus; the absurdity whereof would better
appear, if, seeing under prayers here Psalms and spiritual Songs are
contained, (both being parts of Invocation) they would have no stinted Psalms,
but conceive their songs too, and so sing them: for in truth there is no more
reason for the one then for the other; but Gods Church has ever had, as a form
of Doctrine, both of Faith, in the Creed, and of life, in the Decalogue; so of
Prayer too, which from Acts 13. 2. the Fathers in all ages have called a
Liturgy, or the Service of God. So the Reverend Bishop. And Alsted Theol.
Proph. p. 216.
says, Eruditio eruditionum est Symbolum; Virtus virtutum est Decalogus;
Litania litaniarum est Oration Dominica.

I shall close this with that which D. Wilkins has said of this subject; who
after a debate, pro and Dr. Wilkins gift of Prayer, p. 14.
con, for Prayer by form, and without form, concludes, That generally it is
both lawful and necessary to prepare our selves, as for the gift in general, so
for every particular Act of it, by premeditating, if we have leisure for it,
both matter, order, and words; for though it be a gift of the Spirit, yet it is
not to be expected that it should suddenly be infused into us without any
premeditation of our own, no more then the gift of preaching, for which the
ablest Ministers are bound to prepare themselves with diligence and study;
there being not any ground for a man to expect more immediate supplies from
above in the duty of Prayer, then in that of preaching. And page 15. Because
there will be sometime a necessity that our affections should follow, and be
stirred up by our expressions, (which is especially to be aimed at when we pray
in public, in reference to those that join with us, and will very often fall
out likewise in our secret devotions) therefore it is requisite that a man
should be always furnished with such premeditated forms as may be most
effectual to this end, namely, to excite the affections; and to this purpose,
if those heads which will be always pertinent, and of continual necessity,
were comprehended in some set forms, studied with care and diligence, they
might perhaps be more serviceable for the stirring up our faith and affections,
then they could otherwise be, if they did proceed only from our own sudden
conceptions: and page 17. Such crude notions, and confused matter, as some by
their neglect in this kind will vent, does rather nauseate, and flat the
devotion, then excite it: page 18. There is nothing more unsuitable to the
solemnity of this duty, to that reverence which we owe to the Divine Majesty,
then to be speak him in a loose, careless, empty manner.

And to that objection from Matthew 10. 19. Take not thought how or what ye
shall speak, for it shall be given you in that same hour:

He answers; When men may use the common means, it is a great presumption to
depend upon extraordinary helps, such as were there promised to assist them in
special services. The son of Sirach says, Before thou prayest prepare thy
self, and be not as one that tempts the Lord: he that Ecclus. 18. 23.
rusheth upon this duty without using the common means of fitting himself for
it, does tempt God. Of this those are guilty who depend so much upon immediate
infusion, as to neglect all previous study.

This (de jure) concerning the lawfulness and Sect. 28.
great convenience of forms. The matter o fact, and the constant use of them
in the Church has been sufficiently testified already from those ancient
Liturgies before named; many of which, though (as all Protestants grant) have
been lamentably adulterated by the additions and alterations of late
Sophisters, do yet retain manifest impressions of antiquity; so that though it
may be disputed concerning them, as about Theseus his ship at Athens, whether
it were the same ship or not, every part almost being changed, yet it was
granted, that such a ship there had once been; Even so certain it is, there
were Liturgies in those Primitive times, though we cannot affirm of any one
Liturgy now commended to us under those Apostolical names, that it is
completely the same as it was of old. Rivet indeed reckons those Liturgies
among zizania, or tares which were sown by the enemy while the husbandmen
slept: but certainly the husbandman had sown good seed in those fields, though
the enemy took the advantage of sowing suddenly after them; the foundation was
good, though ungodly men built hay and stubble on it.

St. Augustine observed many corruptions in Aug. de bona Perseverant.
these public devotions in his time, but yet highly commended the prayers of
the Church; Utinam tardi cord, etc. I would to God that they who are of a slow
heart would so hear our disputes, that they would also consider our prayers,
which the Church has always had, and will have unto the worlds end.

The Magdeburgenses have this observation Cent. 3. c. 6. p. 135.
from St. Cyprian, that the rite observed in the public Prayers of the Church,
was this; The Priest at the beginning of Prayer did stir up the people to a
devout calling on God, saying, Sursum corda, Lift up your hearts; and they
answered, We lift them up unto the Lord: and they add, Formulas quasdam
precationum sine dubio habuerant, They had without doubt certain forms of
Origin in Euchylog. and contra Celsum.
Prayer. Origin has some remains of those ancient forms; he says they had
(...), Ordained Prayers; to some of which he often alludes, as on Jeremy,
Frequenter in oratione dicimus, etc. We often say in our prayers, Grant this O
heavenly Father, grant us a portion with thy Prophets, and the Apostles of thy
Christ. Eusebius says, that Constantine had (...) for De vita Constant. l. 4.
c. 20.
his Army and Family, and (...), studied, premeditated and appointed prayers.
The Council of Laodicea speaks of (...), Can. 18. c. 19.
A Liturgy of Prayer; and that at the entrance into the Church, first the
Prayer of the Catechumeni was said, then that of the Penitents, and lastly,
that of the Faithful. And the Council of Carthage ordained thus; Quicunque
preces Can. 23.
aliunde desumit, etc. Whoever did frame any other prayers, should first
consult with his more learned brethren.

The Milevitan Council took care that the Prayers of the Church, and no others,
should be used. Then St. Basil, Though we are bid to pray concinually (says
he) yet may we not despise the prayers of the Church. And Council. Gangren. Can.
5. Anno 324.
has made one Canon to this end, Ne orationes Ecclesiae contemnantur, That the
Prayers of the Church be not contemned.

The chief Objection against the use of forms of Prayer is for ever silenced by
Doctor Preston.

The Objection is this; That in stinted Prayers Sect. 29. Object. Saints daily
exercise, p. 81.
the Spirit is straightened; when a man is tied to a form, then he shall have his
Spirit as it were bounded and limited, that he cannot go beyond that which is
prescribed; and therefore (say they) it is reason a man should be left to more
liberty, (as he is in conceived Prayer) and not tied to a strict form.

To this I answer, (says he) that even those Answ.
men that are against this, and that use this reason, they do the same thing
daily in the congregation; for when another prays that is a set form to him
that hears it; I say it is a set form; for put the case that he which is the
hearer, and does attend another praying, suppose that his spirit be more
enlarged, it is a straitning of him, he has no more liberty to go out, he is
bound to keep his mind intent upon that which the other prays; and therefore
if that were a sufficient reason that a man might not use a set form, because
the spirit is straightened, a man should not hear another pray, (though it be a
conceived Prayer) because in that case his spirit is limited; it may be that
the hearer has a larger heart a great deal then he that speaks and prays, so
that there is a bounding, straitning and limiting of the Spirit to him; and
therefore that reason cannot be good. So far that pious Doctor.

And if his reason be good, it will follow, That the Church does no more quench
or limit the Spirit, in prescribing a form to the Ministers, then they do
quench or limit the Spirit in the people, whom they from time to time do
confine unto those forms which they do presently conceive and utter among them.
And as the spirit of the people is in this respect subject to 1 Cor. 14. 32.
the Prophets, so the spirit of the Prophets divisim, severally, is subject to
the Prophets conjunctim, jointly.

That which is objected by some against the use of forms, from 1 Corinthians
14. 15. I will pray with the Spirit, etc. is not at all understood by the
Objectors: Calvine says, Call. Instit. lib. 3. c. 20.
Spiritus voce singular linguarum donum, etc.

By the word Spirit that extraordinary gift of tongues is to be understood. And
Beza, on Orabo spiritu, (i.) says he, lingua perogrina quam mihi dictat
Spiritus: I will pray in the spirit is no more then this, I will pray in a
strange tongue, as the Spirit shall dictate to me; and so on verse 16. When
thou shall bless with the spirit (i.) in a strange tongue, how shall he, etc.
Or if this place could possibly be understood of extemporary effusions in
Prayer, they were extraordinary ones, wherein the Spirit dictated words as well
as matter; and such as cannot now be pretended to.

But lastly, if by that Scripture praying in the spirit excludes forms of
Prayer, then by Verse 15. singing in the spirit excludes forms of singing; and
so we should bring in extemporarie Psalms too, and then I fear we should
transgress that of our Apostle, verse 40. Let all things be done decently and
in order, According to appointment ((...)) among you.

It is the duty of every Christian to grow in Sect. 30.
the exercise of his gifts and graces in Prayer, to be able on all occasions to
lift up holy desires to God; and he that endeavors not this, may be marked
with that Character of an hypocrite which Eliphaz would have stamped on him,
Thou restrainest prayer from God, Thou keep thy Job 15. 4. Imminues loquelam.
prayer from growing. So Fenner. And they that cannot go to spread their wants
in the presence of God without the help of a form, are strangers to a great
part of their happiness, which consists in a free, filial, and ingenuous
communion with God.

And I make no question but Ministers may and ought on new occasions to add
and alter many Petitions, and after long experience and practice in private,
may exercise those gifts of Prayer which God has given them, in public; but
yet if the occasion may be fore-known, if it do not surprise him too suddenly,
no question but by study and deliberation he may better comply with it, and
excite the peoples affections more then he can in an extemporarie manner: And
when in the main, both the matter and method of Prayer (as Invocation,
Confession, Supplication, Intercession and Thanksgiving) are still the same,
there can be, as no sure sign of grace in varying the words, so) no just cause
of rash censure in retaining and using the same; for since we pray to the same
God, in the Name of the same Mediator, profess our belief in the same truths,
feel the same wants, and fear the same evils, inward and outward, (and all
these are in a great measure common to all) we may as well meditate and prepare
in what words, a in what sense, and in what manner we ought to come before the
Majesty of God, as for what end; and certainly wholesome words deliberately
fitted, (by one or more judicious and experienced Disciples) to the capacities
and understanding of the hearers, are soonest received into their hearts, and
have a greater influence upon the affections, to raise them, and lift them up
to God in Prayer, then any other.

But enough of these premises; The conclusion is this: If both public and
private forms be lawful and expedient, as both the practice of the Church, and
the judgment of men famous for Learning and Piety do assert, surely then there
cannot be any fault (on the account of its being a form) justly imputed to our
Lords Prayer, or which may justify the disuse of it.

For, let all the Arguments that are brought in defense of other forms (as for
singing Psalms, Sect. 31.
administration of the Sacraments, blessing the people) be all summed up, and
each of them may be easily and highly improved for the lawful use of this
form: I shall give you (for instance) a view of these Arguments that are urged
by a Reverend and judicious Divine for singing Psalms; and every one may
perceive how fitly they may be accommodated to the use of our Lords Prayer.

1. If singing of Psalms in David's forms (in which are many Prayers) be a
Gospel-Ordinance, so is praying unto God in our Savior form.

2. If there be no reason why our conceived Psalms should thrust out David's
Psalms, neither is there any reason why our conceived prayers should thrust
out our Saviors Prayer.

3. If upon concession that we must sing Psalms, David's Psalms will carry it
(there being no art or spirit of man that can come near that of David:) Then
also upon concession that we must pray, Christ's Prayer will carry it; there
being no art or spirit of man that can come near that of Christ.

4. If none dare deny but that the Levites had the assistance of the Spirit,
when they praised God in the words of David; then neither can any deny
(whatever they dare) but that the Disciples of Christ may have the assistance
of the Spirit, when they pray to God in the words of Christ; Qua Tertul. de
Oratione.
nulla spiritualior oration, Then which there is no prayer more spiritual; as
Tertul.

5. Are David's Psalms to be sung, because they suit with all occasions of the
people of God, as well, or better then any songs composed by an ordinary gift?
for the same reason ought our Saviors Prayer to be used, it being fitted to
the necessities of the people of God in all ages, in all conditions, and for
all just desires. And thus every Argument for any other form may a fortiori be
more strongly applied to this, and all Answers to any Objections against them
will be subservient to this most excellent form.

Of which, as Hooker says, Though men should Sect. 32.
speak with the tongues of Angels, yet words so pleasing to the ears of God as
those which the Son of God himself has composed, were not possible for men to
frame; for he that made us live has also taught us to pray, to the end, that
speaking to the Father in the Sons prescript form, without scholy or gloss of
ours, we may be sure that we offer nothing that God will disallow or deny. A
Prayer which uttered with true devotion and zeal of heart, affords to God
himself that glory, that aid to the weaker sort, to the most perfect that solid
comfort which is unspeakable.

A Prayer, (says Dr. Espaigne) dictated by the supreme wisdom of God, that
great and eternal Mediator, who presents all our prayers to God, and perfectly
knows his Fathers mind; the most complete Prayer that can be made, summing up
all lawful requests which can be imagined; The Epitome; rule and mi rour of all
others: A Prayer which in its wonderful brevitie includes so great a plenty of
matter, as if it would cause a Camel to pass through the eye of a needle; a
Prayer which contains more matter and mysteries then words; the most
Methodical, Emphatical and Divine that can be found: All the parts cohere with
an admirable symmetrie and proportion, all full of torches inlightning each
other; and it is confessed by all, that all the wits on Earth, and all the Angels
in Heaven, were not able to dictate the like; Tantum series, and res, junctur
aque pollet:

Its body is composed with so much art,
That Christ's soul breaths in all and every part.
There is not in it (perhaps) so large an enumeration of particulars, as to
some weak apprehensions may seem necessary, (nor indeed can all the necessities
of particular persons be fully, and to their apprehension, expressed by any
Minister that has the best faculty, and takes the most time to do it;) but
this excellency is eminently in our Lords Prayer, that there are both general
heads, and significant words, under which an enlarged heart may conceive and
present to God all his grievances and necessities, and beg any blessing that
concerns life or godliness; as some of the Rabbines say of Manna, that it
yielded to every man the relish of that dainty which his appetite and palate
did most desire and delight in. It is like a well-limm'd Picture, that respects
all, and yet seems intent upon every one in the room; sit pro omnibus
Christianis, and omnes Christiani vicissim illam pro nobis recitant, as Alsteed
says. It is made for all Christians, and by all Christians for each other.
Theol. Proph. p. 197.
It is a daily miracle whereby our Savior with six Petitions supplies all
things necessary for souls and bodies, not for a few thousands, but the whole
Christian world; and there remain fragments for the heathen world too.

When thou come to God to present thy prayers in the Congregation, the
Minister ufeth his own words, to express his own conceptions, and confines
himself sometime to one or two particular heads of Prayer, so as thou may not
meet with any expressions that may signify thy desires, which therefore may
languish, and never ascend up to the Throne of Grace; but our Lords Prayer has
this certain advantage above others, that it is accommodated to all persons,
things, times and places, and to all sorts and conditions of people; Capi
potest (as Alsteed,) Alsteed ubi supra.
It may be understood and used of children, and all people; of those that are
sick at home, and busied abroad; those that are of a slow memory, or of the
quickest invention: there is such an ocean of matter, that the Elephant may
swim, the most enlarged spirit may expatiate in it, and yet the tender lamb
that has any knowledge of other essential parts of Christian Religion, may
wade through it without either sin or danger. Herein (though we are alone) we
are sure to hold communion, and join in consort with the Universal Church, and
to have the united aid of the Prayers of all Gods people: and what a comfort is
it, what an encouragement to pray in faith, when we know all the people of God
agree with us, (and there is a promise to two or three) to ask Matthew. 18. 19.
the same things, in one and the same effectual Prayer; compassing the Throne
of Grace with many hands and eyes, but with one heart and lip, as if they would
offer violence to the Kingdom of Matthew. 11. 12. Sect. 33.
Heaven, and take it by force?

And now I beg leave to reason the case briefly with my dissenting brethren,
Quae tanta fuit causa? what great cause prevailed with them to neglect so good
a practice? was it any thing intrinsecal and essential to the Prayer? that
cannot be; It is a land that flows with Rivers of pleasure, infinitely beyond
those of milk and honey, a Paradise wherein every tree is a tree of Life,
whose fruits never fade nor fail; Uno avulso non deficit alter Aureus. Of
which, as eloquent and pious Mr. Herbert in like case:

I value this Prayer so,
That were I to leave all but one,
Wealth, fame, endowments, virtues, all should go,
I and this Prayer would together dwell,
And quickly gain for each inch lost an ell.
Let us view this Canaan in a Map, and we shall find it to be full of all
perfections.

1. The Preface; what term of invocation gives better encouragement then
(Father?) what works greater reverence then (Heaven?) what can raise the soul
to a higher plerophorie of of faith, then when Christ that made the God of
Heaven to become our Father, bids us also call him ours? Then for the matter
and method of all the Petitions, which accord like Beauty and Bands, they are
equally admirable: In them we Zach. 11. 7.
ask, first, that which is the principal end of our being, viz. Gods glory in
the first Petition; then the subordinate, our own salvation in the second
Petition: and thirdly, the things conducing to both ends, either principal, as
Sanctification, in the third; or secondary, as sustentation of life in the
fourth Petition: and lastly, the removing of impediments, all our former sins
in the fifth: and all occasions of offending for the present, or the time to
come, in the last Petition: and so we conclude all in a Hymn of praise, which
does no less encourage us to expect, then it does acknowledge Gods Power to
grant, the things prayed for; to all which things there is no Christian but
will say, Amen, so be it.

Thus there is nothing intrinsecal, as to the matter or method, that may make
us offended at it; it must be in the form therefore, or not at all.

But first, S. Paul co^mends a form of wholesome words, and approves the
observation of it: And 2 Timothy 1 13.
when our Savior did not only make it a form in St. Matthew, but use it as
such, in St. Luke; and having fitted it for public Devotion, prescribed it to
his Disciples, it is an invincible Argument, that the use of a form, qua talis,
is not offensive to God or man; we may safely follow that Lamb wherever he
leads us.

In the next place therefore they must be some extrinsecal arguments that have
persuaded to this omission; But if it appear (as I hope it does) to be a
Precept of Christ, when we pray, to say, Our Father, let the motive that
prevailed with us be what it will be, it can never excuse us; for as we may do
no evil that any good may come of it, so neither may we constantly omit any
good duty that is prescribed, on pretense that it may occasion evil. Si de
veritate scandalum sumatur, melius est ut scandalum oriutur quam ut veritas
relinquatur, says Gregory. If Gregor. 9. Mag. Hom. 7. in Ezekiel.
scandal be taken against any truth, it is better that men should be causelessly
offended, then the truth shamefully betrayed. Sin gets strength, and takes
advantage by the Commandments of the Law, and sometimes the corruption of man's
heart is enraged and heightened by the preaching of the Gospel; yet
notwithstanding these and many more offenses taken by wicked men, we must
preach both the Law and the Gospel too; though it prove a stone of stumbling,
and a savor of death to some, yet it is the savor of life and salvation unto
others. Suppose then this form be abused to ill purposes by some, and (as is
said) occasioneth formalitie in others; yet they that know it to be their
duty, and have grace to use it better, may not neglect it upon that pretense:
certain it is, our good use of it will more benefit them, then their abuse of
it can prejudice us; and we know, as the Civilians teach, nulla est obligatio
ad illicita, there can be no obligation laid on us to do what is forbidden, or
to leave undone what is required by Law, both these being illicita, unlawful.

Yea, supposing this form had not been prescribed, Sect. 34.
but left as a thing indifferent to be used or not used pro arbitrio, yet
seeing indifferent things do then become necessary, when by the use of them God
may have most glory, and his people most benefit, as well by the increase of
peace and holiness, as by the prevention of division and wickedness; I would
gladly join issue here, and bring it to a fair trial and determination with any
sober man, whether the using or not using the Lords Prayer as a form be most
conducible to these ends.

And should we give it but Lidford Law, and sit in judgment after Execution,
to hear the indictment and evidences produced against it; and after the general
neglect of it, I should ask the same question as the Governor did in behalf
of its Maker, what evil has it done? and upon Matthew. 26. 23.
hearing, no evil, but a great good has appeared in the use of it; and
contrary, no good, but a great deal of evil, by the omission; and after this
the multitude should continue and heighten their clamours against it, and those
who have been chiefly faulty herein should instead of washing their hands, or
acknowledging that they have sinned in denying this most excellent useful
Prayer, say still, the guilt be upon us and upon our children; there is just
ground of suspicion given that they have not that Christian prudence, and pious
affection to the things of Christ, as they ought to have that profess
themselves his Disciples.

And now if (as I have heard since I first Sect. 35.
thought on this subject) any man's blood and passion, shall be troubled by the
view of these considerations (as natural concupiscence is often excited by the
Law, which seeks to restrain it) so as that they do sound a trumpet, and bid
defiance, and make parties against such as in obedience to an apparent command
of Christ shall continue or reassume this practice, let them know that they do
not deal with others (whose consciences may be as tender as their own,) as they
themselves would be dealt with; and it will but little extenuate their sin that
do oppose the practice of any Ordinance of Jesus Christ, though they should be
persuaded that therein they do God good service; and as surely as it was
piously, and in obedience to our Saviors in junction practiced by the people
of God in former ages, so it cannot be omitted, much less opposed, by any among
us, without great suspicion of pride and disobedience: But this by way of
caution; I go on to argue the case in hand.

And in the next place, It is a thing impossible Sect. 36.
for any rational man to conceive, that when our Savior bid his Disciples,
when they pray, to say, Our Father, etc. that it should be his sense and
intent, that we ought not to say so, or that we should do amiss in so doing.
Had there been any danger in using of it, our Savior, who foresaw all possible
inconveniences and offenses, and bid us especially to pray that we might not be
led into temptation, would not have brought us to a precipice, or, as Satan
carried him upon a Pinnacle of the Temple, from whence we might the more easily
and irrecoverably fall, having a Scriptum est to cast us headlong into that
(supposed) offense of saying as he taught us; for most certain it is that upon
these very words of our Savior, Thus pray ye, and when ye pray, say, the
Church of Christ in all ages has been induced to use the very words of this
prayer in all their solemn Devotions; and if they have offended in so doing, or
if the inconveniences which have followed the practice be chargeable upon it as
proper effects of it, let those that so judge consider, whether they do not
make our Savior an accessarie, if not a principal, in all those offenses; and
it is more safe to be reputed an offender with him, then innocent in any
society that separates from him.

But it will be objected, That our Savior commanded Sect. 37. Object.
this Prayer, as a platform, to frame our Prayers like unto it in matter and
method only, and not at all in the use of the same words.

That our Savior should make it a form, and so Answ.
use it more then once, and yet intend it only for a platform, is wondrously
strange; and why we who use to hear the prayers and praises of holy men in
their several forms and expressions as well as matter, may not as innocently
and devoutly use this of our Savior, is a very rare and abstruse speculation.
The Creed, the Rule of Faith, must not be varied in words by any private
person, nor the Decalogue the rule of works; yet this, which is not only a
Rule, but a most perfect Form of Prayer, must not be used in the prescribed
words.

Suppose a Minister should frame his whole public prayer of Scripture-forms
and expressions, (such as we have fitted to all occasions) no doubt but such a
Prayer, though it consisted of forms, would be of excellent use and efficacy;
and why the summing up of that Prayer or rather the consummating of it in our
Lords Prayer, should be accounted less useful and effectual, no impartial eye
can discern; seeing, as the matter of this would be more comprehensive, so the
Architecture and composure of it is far beyond the contrivance of any humane
inventions; and if our care to study the Scriptures, and out of them to choose
acceptable words and phrases for the composition of our Prayers, then surely
our fixing upon this most wholesome form of words, deserves yet a greater
commendation, and (necessitate medii as well as praecepti) becomes necessary,
as being most fit to affect the understanding, and thereby to stir up the
affections, by the quickness, plainness, significancie and fullness of it.
Suppose our Savior instead of this form had set down only the heads of Prayer,
as thus; when ye pray, observe these Rules; First, invocate God as your
Heavenly Father, and pray that he would dispose of you, and all things, to the
glory of his Name and Holy Attributes: then for the enlargement and
consummation of his Kingdom, grace and glory, etc. And having so done, a
Christian Disciple should have done by our Saviors Directorie as some have
done by the Assemblie's, turn the heads and matter of Prayer with little
alteration into a form, which form would have been like this of our Lords
Prayer; doubtless that prayer would have been very pious and acceptable; and
seeing it was our Saviors good pleasure to save us that labor, and to compose
those heads more summarily and significantly then we can do, I wonder why the
same words ought not to be used by us. If it be required that in all our
prayers we should have this pattern for matter in our minds, why should we not
sometimes have the same form of words in our mouths? It is hard measure to make
a man Isa. 29. 21.
an offender for such words as these; Our prayers which are then only
acceptable when presented in our Saviors Name, do not ipso facto become void
when presented in his words: That rule which gives rectitude to another is it
self most right and perfect to all uses and purposes: If on sudden emergencies
we may use some briefer forms of prayer without a precept, why on more solemn
occasions may we not use this most exquisite form, which is so positively
enjoined? Every prayer, by whomsoever indicted, is acceptable to God, when
presented in faith, though read out of a book, or repeated by memory, (other
essential properties of prayer being joined) why not this then, which is put
into our mouths by him who gave us a right to ask, as well as instructions how
to ask aright? That holy Spirit which helps our infirmities, and assists our
weak devotions, even in sighs and groans, did and will doubtless abound in
every Petition of this prayer, when offered from a penitent heart; That Dove
loves such Olive-branches. I have heard and read, that wicked spirits have been
conjured and dispossessed by an impious perverting and abuse of this prayer;
but that the good Spirit of God, who indicted it for use, should abandon it when
used by humble and faithful Christians, is a degree of blasphemy to think. And
upon what account we Protestants shall be able to justify our quarrel against
the Papists for leaving out the Doxology, when at once we casheer the whole
Prayer, will be hard to find. Beza says, it is Vera omnium Christianarum
precum summa ac formula. Annot. in Matthew.

Let us therefore (dear Brethren) whom God Sect. 38.
has made his more public servants, as gladly and readily continue and
reassume the practice of this long-neglected duty, as the people did the feast
of Tabernacles, which they celebrated with very great gladness, after it had
been omitted Neh. 8. 17
for some hundreds of years.

I can only pray and hope, that every public Minister will bring the spices
and flames of his Devotion, that he may help to raise this Phoenix out of her
ashes; or at least that every one whose judgment and conscience is convinced
that it is his duty to use it, will not be withheld from the exercise of it by
any shame or fear whatever: it is no shame to rectify an error, but to
persevere in it; and fear and shame where there is no Errare possum, haereticus
esse nol^.
sin, but contrarily a manifest duty incumbent on us, are but bugbears to
affright children and cowards, and should not at all move any good soldier of
Jesus Christ from his station; or if any such thing might befall us, yet the
great dishonor that has redounded to our Nation, and the Church of Christ
among us, through the neglect of this duty, should to a public person, and
will, if he have a public spirit too, render all personal reflections
inconsiderable. We have not been afraid or ashamed to plead for and practice
some forms of which there is not so Confirmation. Excommunication.
clear a warrant in Scripture as for this (although they are lawful and
necessary in their kind) only this, like the wounded person, is past by
without any commiseration from Priest or Levite; although we cannot practice
any of them in so much faith as this: for, God having commended his Son to us,
saying, this is my beloved Son, hear him, how confidently may we recommend our
prayers back unto him, and say, Lord thus thy beloved Son has taught us to
pray, Hear thou us in his Name and Words?

Besides, it may be considered, whether this Sect. 39.
prayer may not as well be left out in our Catechismes for the instruction of
youth, (and if this, then the Creed, and the Commandments too, and so we
should reduce our selves to that which some would have (i.) no Catechism at
all, for fear of forms) as well as from our prayers in the Congregation; for
even among the elder people are some children in knowledge, who need to be
taught again the first Principles of Christian Religion, and who indeed are
incapable of higher seize, unless such a soundation be laid; and if these
things should be disused, experience may assure us that some would slight them,
and others forget them, and a great part of our people be willingly ignorant of
the true sense and meaning, as well as of the letter of them; and (which is
also a sad truth) cast off the very form of godliness, as well as the form of
prayer: all which mischiefs, seeing the frequent use and occasional
interpretation of these fundamentals of our Religion may in all probability,
through the blessing of God, prevent for the future, we are in duty obliged to
the use of them.

And if those masters of Families which wholly neglect the duty of prayer, and
so have not the appearance of Christianity among them, (the Heathen and the
families that call not on Gods Name being both alike) would begin that duty
with this form, and some other joined to it, and having learned themselves the
true meaning of each Petition, (the prime and literal sense whereof would be
easily found) would teach it to their families, I doubt not, but as hereby they
would give an evidence of their being Christians, so they might certainly
obtain the blessing of God for themselves and families; and who knows whether
the wisdom of God did not abbreviate the Doctrine and form of prayer, and make
it so plain and easy, for this end among others, to render them inexcusable
who should omit this duty when it would cost them so little labor, study or
time, the words being so few and plain, so nigh them, even in their mouths?
Oratirnem Deuteronomy. 30. 14. Lyra on Matthew. 6.
(says Lyra) brevibus verbis composuit, ut sit nobis siducia cito annuendi
quod breviter vult rogari; Our Savior composed this prayer in few words, that
we might believe to receive speedily what he commands us to ask briefly: And
Mr. Calvine to the same purpose; The only Son of God has put words into our
mouths which may clear our minds from all doubting. It was convenient (says
Aquinas) to the consummation of our hope, that a form of Prayer Aquinas

should be delivered by Christ, wherein he shows what things we may hope for
from him, by what he has willed us to ask of him. It is doubtless a
commendable Office to instruct both our Churches and Families, as Christ did
instruct his, yea, and to inculcate the same lesson again and again, as Christ
did, until they be perfectly acquainted with it. Not that I would have any the
most private Christian to set up his rest here, or in any other forms; but my
desire is, that such as have not yet gone so far, would begin with this, as a
step and help, yea as a pillar and foundation of their devotions; and whatever
progress they make, they will see so much imperfection in this, (if they be
humble Christians) that (as they say of Apelles, when with great care and skill
he drew the picture of Campaspe, he fell in love with the Original) they will
embrace and reverence this Prayer the more as long as they live.

Remember therefore that Christ has enjoined the use of this prayer; whose
injunction, as it makes it our duty, so it will be our discharge; and the
practice of learned and pious Christians will be our encouragement: And if any
contentious spirit shall withdraw his neck from this gentle and easy yoke that
is imposed by the precept of Christ, and so kick against both, I will only say
as the Apostle does, we have no such custom, neither 1 Cor. 11. 16.
the Churches of God.

If all this will not move, I beseech my brethren Sect. 40.
sadly to reflect on the manifold inconveniences and mischiefs that have
followed upon the neglect of observing the matter and form of this prayer; for
of both these omissions our age is generally guilty, and it is a rare thing to
find any that neglects the form to comply duly with the matter and method of
it; and then they do undoubtedly offend, when they neither say, this, nor
thus, as Christ did command them. Do not some men forget the Publicans
confession, and only satisfy themselves with the Pharisees congratulation?
are not those faults grown rise and common, against which our Savior
prescribed Matthew. 6. 7. Juvenal. Satyr 3.
this prayer as a remedy? Is it not true which the Poet observed of old,
nocitura petuntur, some things have been desired that have been for the matter
unlawful, and for the manner of asking sinful? One thinks this prayer a mean
contemprible thing, unfit to be taught their children; another speaks it out,
That there is more devotion in a verse or two of David's Psalms, then in all
our Lords Prayer. It is agreeable to the nature of public prayer, that
whatsoever news or occurrences, opinion or interest, passion or prejudice,
whatever design or debate, public or private, men do espouse, should be made
the subject of public prayer; and so the people have many times stones given
them instead of bread. And whereas it is said, that the use of this and other
forms has a direct tendency to spiritual laziness and formalitie in prayer; I
can only wish that the prayers of those that despise this were secured from
the temptations of speaking rashly and unadvisedly with their lips, of priding
themselves in the ostentation of parts and gifts, to the raising of invincible
prejudice in the hearts of the people against such as have not the like
faculties, and causing them to have some men's persons in admiration, as if
invention, and the apt cadencie of words, and confident elocution, were the
principal parts of Christian oratory; whereas it is undeniable, that men of
unsanctified spirits may in these exercises exceed the soundest Christians; as
the Rabbines say Achitophel did, who had three new prayers for every day; and
our late writers affirm of Hacket, who in Cambdens Elizabeth. Casauhon of
Enthus. p. 213.
the days of Queen Elizabeth died a blasphemer, yet could perform this
exercise to the admiration of his hearers.

Alas! how many disorderly and impertinent prayers have been publicly
delivered! what a monstrous excess in some, and a like defect of the essential
parts of prayer in others! no marks of our Saviors rule, either in matter,
method or form, as if we had found out some new North-west passage to the
throne of Grace, which the wisdom of our great Pilot did not discover:
Against such prayers as these good Christians may safely oppose that form of
Plato, Deus Rex optime, bona quaeque nobis voventibus and non vo ventibus
tribue; mala autem etiam poscentibus abesse jube. O God our great King, grant
us all good things, whether we ask them or not, and command evil things to be
kept from us, though we desire them never so earnestly.

These things remember me of Esops Fables; of a River that railed against the
Fountain, as being sluggish and immovable, and had not a Fish in it, whereas
her streams did abound with variety of fish, and did incessantly pass by the
fruitful valleys, making music as they went: whereat the Fountain was
displeased, and restrained his waters, and so the streams dried up, the fish;
perished, and all the pleasant murmurs ceased.

I speak not this any ways to reproach the holy prayers of those ancient and
experienced Saints of God, who by his blessing upon their daily industry, and
constant exercises of devotion, have attained a more excellent way: for which
gifts and graces as I do from my soul bless God, and account them the horsemen
and Chariots of our 1 Kings 13. 14.
Israel; so it is also the desire of my heart to be remembered of them in all
their addresses to the throne of Grace: But only to express the just regret of
my soul for the many miscarriages of rash and inconsiderate persons, discovered
in public devotions, which, through the defect of necessary matter, and the
redundancy of impertinencies, and for the great disorder and want of method,
having no imaginable resemblance with our Saviors form, we may name Ichabod,
where 1 Samuel 4. 21.
is the glory? Against all these real, or but possible evils, did we lay the
line and rule of our Lords Prayer to our devotions, and apply it to each part,
Componens manibusque manus atque oribus ora, as the Prophet Elisha put his
mouth upon the dead child's mouth, his eyes upon the child's eyes, etc. 2 Kings
4. 34.
we might perceive new life and spirit to inspire them, to the comfort of all
that hear them. To such therefore especially as are conscious to themselves
that they have been often surprised to speak rashly and impertinently in the
Congregation; to such as in Mr. Calvines phrase are guilty of desultorie
levity, and are tempted to ostentation and vain glory, I earnestly recommend
this remedy, that they would better observe the matter and method of Christ's
Prayer, and study more to conform their own thereunto; and for fear of failing
in this, would they devoutly use the very form too, as Christ has enjoined
them, it would prove an excellent remedy against the above named evils; and
surely, when neither in matter nor form we express any care to resemble this
Architype, we do as much as in us lies make void this injunction of our
Savior.

Again, this mischief has been the product of disusing this Prayer, that some
(whom we should judge more sober and knowing Christians by their profession) if
they hear a Minister sum up his devotions in it, (though he be a person of
excellent parts and piety) they presently conceive a prejudice against him, as
being a man of a carnal, formal temper, and of a different persuasion from
themselves; and so deprive themselves of that Spiritual comfort and edification
which otherwise they might receive by his Ministry: yea, it has been known,
that on the very repetition of this Prayer, some have immediately withdrawn
themselves from the Ordinances of God, and so forsaken their own mercies; for
whom my hearts desire is, that they may have time and hearts in humility and
faith to say this Prayer, once at least, before they die; and God forbid that I
should ceas to pray for them in another form of our Savior, Luke 23. 34.
Father forgive them, they know not what they do.

If for thirty or forty years since, or any age of the Church beyond that
home to our Saviors time, it should have been adjudged scandalous to use the
Lords Prayer, the Creed, or the Commandments, or any should have made it the
mark of a faithful Disciple to omit these things, the present Church would
doubtless have branded the authors of that Opinion for Arch-hereticks; and yet
not this opinion only, but the practice too, has like a gangrene so spread it
self over the face of the land, and the hearts of the people, that those
Ministers are generally excluded from the number of Christ's faithful and able
Disciples who devoutly repeat these things: And if this malady only were
cured, I shall account this labor happily bestowed. But beside this, some
sober men, whose judgments and practices have been for the use of this prayer
as a form, being called to pray in Congregations of a contrary persuasion, to
avoid the Charybdis of giving a groundless offense, have run on the Scylla of
disobeying Christ, and swerving from their own principles, as if they were
ashamed of Christ and Mark 8. 38.
of his words in an adulterous generation: And who knows whether for our
wilful neglect of this one, many among us have not been justly deprived of
other of Gods Ordinances, and given up to contempt of them? But there are yet
sadder effects then these; The disuse of it by some has been improved to a
contempt of it in others, in so much that they whose duty it was to have
blessed God for it, (as for a Jacobs ladder to lift them nearer Heaven) have
degenerated so far from Christianity, as to thank God they have forgotten it,
and to abhor the teaching of it to their children, as if it were some unluckie
spell or charm; yea, (and what is enough to make us all tremble) have quaked at
the repetition of it. These are sad considerations, and cannot be denied to be
for the most part the proper effects of omitting this prayer; and, as ever we
hope to have them cease, we should join with one consent to remove the cause,
and renew our first love to this Ordinance, bring back again with joy and
gladness this Ark to the House of God, and prove if he will not open the
windows of heaven, and pour down his blessings upon us.

To such as have conscienciously continued the Sect. 41.
use of this prayer, I say as the Angel did to the Church of Philadelphia, Hold
thou that fast which Revel. 3. 11.
thou have, Let no man take thy Crown; it has not been, nor ever will it be, a
barren or fruitless prayer, unless want of faith and true devotion in us do
hinder its efficacy.

Take heed of a hasty perfunctorie posting of it over, as if the words were
too hot for our mouths, whereby we may cause our good to be evil spoken of: Let
it be uttered with deliberation and servencie in faith, and an actual
apprehension of those mercies which we want and chiefly desire under each
Petition, that both our own and our peoples judgments and affections may
accompany it. And on all occasions open this box of precious ointment, or in a
plain and familiar Exposition of the chief parts of it unto the people; that
the spices thereof may send forth their smell, even a sweet savor of
reconciliation and acceptance with God, a savor of Piety, Charity, and Life

this prayer, which, as the fly which Solomon speaks of, will cause the whole
composition to corrupt. The drawing nigh unto God Matthew. 15. 8.
with the lips, (though in this most excellent Prayer) while the heart is far
from him, will turn this Sacrifice of God into an offering of fools; and
therefore instruct them how every desire of theirs may, and all their present
wants and requests ought to be referred to, and expressed in one of these
Petitions; the diligent Reader may see what Reverend Mr. Ball has Ball on the
Lords Prayer.
written to this purpose: And let none think it enough to use it as a form
only, but let him study to conform all his more solemn devotions to the matter
and method of it; and so we shall be sure to observe our Saviors injunction,
and obtain his blessing.

It remains only now that we wipe off those Objections that stick on this
practice, which although as so many Vipers on Saint Paul's hand, coming out of
the fire which contentious spirits have kindled, may seem to argue its
guiltiness of diverse accusations, yet after that we have had the patience to
look on them awhile, we shall see them fall off of their own accord, and the
sight thereof I hope will cause the Objectors to change their minds.

The first Objection is this; The form related Obje. 1.
by St. Matthew does differ from that in St. Luke; as in the fourth Petition,
what St. Matthew expresses by (...), day by day, St. Luke renders (...), day
by day; and in the fifth Petition for (...), in St. Matthew is (...) in St.
Luke, Our debts, our trespasses; which variety of readings argues that it was
not intended for a form of words to be precisely so used.

It is more then probable that our Savior did Answ. 1.
deliver it both times in the same words; they that hold it was but once
delivered must of necessity acknowledge it; but our Savior using the same
Syriack Dialect, which the Apostles afterward expressed in Greek, as their own
style guided them, it is almost impossible to think how they should accord
better, considering, that although the Holy Ghost did assist them in calling
things to their remembrance, and dictating Divine truths to them, yet did not,
as is reported of the Seventie Interpreters, suggest each word and syllable,
but left both the Apostles and Prophets free to use their own expressions; from
whence it is that this Joseph's coat has such diverse colors, I mean that there
are such different styles of the holy Penmen.

2. There is not a better Harmony in any one passage delivered by any of the
Evangelists then in this; and the difference that is in them is very
inconsiderable, being in show only, and not in sense.

3. St. Augustine resolves the greatest of these August. de verbis Them ni. See
Chemnitius, p. 1977. De his qui poenae astricti sunt. Grotius. 1 Chronicles. 19.
doubts in a Question, Quid est debitum nisi peccatum? what is our debt but our
sin? A sinner in Hebrew is called (...), and sometime (...), but more
frequently in the Syriack language, (...) is used to denote any that is
obnoxious to debt, or guilt and punishment; and in this sense the Chaldee
Paraphrase uses the word four times in Solomon's Prayer; Forgive the debts of
thy people Israel; and the Syriak in Psalm 1. 1. read thus; Blessed is the man
that has not stood in the way (...), of Debtors; this was in the Syriak
language the common name for sinners, and then no wonder if St. Luke knowing
the import of the word, and being (...), best skilled in the Greek Debita (i.)
peccata, Syri Sermonis idiotismo: as Beza in Mat. 6.
Language, did very significantly render that word, sins, which St. Matthew
more literally renders debts; and St. Luke presently expounds himself to
deliver the same thing with St. Matthew; for having said, And forgive us our
trespasses, he adds, as we forgive them that are indebted unto us; and Grotius
says, that St. Lukes Grotius in Locum. Beza in Lucam. 11.
(...) is but an Exposition of what St. Matthew meant by debts: And Beza makes
the other two words of one signification; Idem declarabit (...), atque apud
Matthaeum (...); that i, as much as we shall need this day; and so the vulgate
reads hodie, this day, in both places. The variety of expressions does only
help to understand the true sense and meaning of our Savior the better, as
several Translations do to the understanding of the Original; and in respect
of the Language wherein our Savior delivered this Prayer the Greek is but a
Translation.

But I foresee that this objection may be much improved, by what has been said
by some men of great reputation and learning concerning the Beza and Grotius.
vast difference of these forms in St. Matthew and St. Luke, not in words
only, but in sense, and some essential parts of it; for in the vulgate Latin
these things are omitted, Noster qui es in coelis, the whole third Petition,
Thy will be done, etc. and deliver us from evil; all this in Saint Lukes
relation is wanting: and they with some others do think, that the whole
Doxologie in Saint Matthew was surreptitious, and not of the Text: But of this
anon. Of the particulars left out by St. Luke Beza says this; Haec non legic
vetus interpres, etc. These things an ancient Interpreter does not read, (he
means the Vulgate;) and it appears out of Augustine to Laurentius, that the
Latin exemplars had only five Petitions in this Prayer, the third being
omitted, and the latter part of the sixth, which were afterward supplied out of
Matthew; which that it was done olim, long ago, appears not only by the Greek
Copies, but also by the Syriack Translation. So Beza; and after him Grotius to
the like purpose: Omnino oredibile est, etc. It is very credible that the
particulars omitted in Lukes copy were added out of the Greek of Matthew; his
reason also the same, Cum non extet in Latinis antiquis illud, Because it is
not in the ancient Latins: Now this is the force of the Objection.

If our Savior had intended these words for a Obje. 2.
form of Prayer, he would not have made so great a difference, not in terms
only, but in some of its chief and essential parts; which difference does
evince, that it was not our Saviors will to tie us precisely to the words.

To this I answer, first, that on this supposition Answ.
of defectiveness, as it is not a form, so neither may it be admitted as a
perfect rule or platform, seeing some necessary things are left out; and so we
should make void the injunction of Christ to both purposes.

Secondly, The difference of these forms is in our Translations (which agree
with the most ancient and best Greek copies) inconsiderable, being, as you have
heard in the answer to the former Objection, in show only, not at all in sense;
and I remember that I am to deal now with Protestants, who do own the
Translation now in use, and by consequence the copies from which it was
translated as most authentic. And I beseech them to consider what an
unhansome reflection is hereby made, not on our Translators only, but on all
the Reformers, as if they wanted judgment and discretion to choose, or
integrity to make use of the best copies; In imitando non optimum proponere,
is no wise man's part.

But thirdly, I doubt not but that it will appear, that the most and best Greek
copies have these particulars Originally, and consequently our Translations are
good and authentic. And first, all that Grotius says, is, Graeci quidam
codices omittunt: Some Greek copies (but not many) do omit the third Petition.
Two things therefore I will inquire;

First, the number of those Greek copies that retain these particulars:

Secondly, their quality and authority, which in all probability are most
authentic, either the Copies which omit, or those which retain them.

1. For the number, it will be easily granted that there are more with us then
against us; for (in my observation) these parts are omitted only in these:

1. That of Bezn, given to the Universitie of Cambridge.

2. In that second copy of Henry Stephens, in Matt. ^
where yet, the word Amen is added.

3. In that of March. Velesius, there wants only the first particular, viz.
Our -- which art in Heaven.

4. In that of Magdalene College in Oxford, wants only, which art in Heaven.
So that by the way, it is worth observation, that like false witnesses, neither
of these defective copies do agree among themselves, or with the Vulgate
Latin, that of Beza only excepted; Now there are three or four copies to one
that retain these parts, and they are agreeable to each other, as learned
Chemnitius observes; We follow the Chemnitius Harm. p. 1977.
Greek copies (says he) in which there is no difference as to the sense in
either form, only two words are changed, but of a like signification: and
therefore he expounds the forms jointly, p. 785. and there adds, The Greek
copies do relate the whole Prayer in Luke, after the same manner as in
Matthew, except only the Doxology. Then for the Latin Translations, (though
the Vulgate Chemnitius p. 785.
have it not) yet some in St. Augustines time had it, for in cap. 28. de verbis
Domini, he recites the whole prayer out of St. Luke, as out of Saint Matthew,
and it seems such copies were of use and authority in those days, for St.
Ambrose relates it in like manner; From whence, says Ambrose de Sacrament. l.
5. c. 4.
Chemnitius, it may be gathered that the Latin copies did differ in Augustines
time, some reading this Prayer in St. Luke, as the Greek copies do whole and
entire. Besides, Lucas Brug. numbers eight Latin Manuscripts wherein the third
Petition is retained in St. Luke; where he adds, that it agrees to the Greek
Text of the Kings Bible, and to the Syriack Translation of the same; and of the
other particulars, Qui es in Coelis, and libera nos a malo, he says some
Latin exemplars have them.

Now here that I may give more full satisfaction, and because the consequence
of what I shall say may resolve another scruple concerning the Doxologie, I
shall briefly discuss these four things:

1. The authority of the Greek Copies above others. 2. Which of the Greek
Copies are most authentic. 3. In what ancient Beza's Greek Copy is to he
had. 4. What is the rise and authority of the Vulgate Latin.
First, the authority of the Greek Copies is acknowledged even by the Papists
themselves, when they are serious, to be Apostolical. Bellarmine says, Constat
N. T. Graece scriptum esse ab De verb^ Dei. l. 2. c. 7.
Apostolis vel Evangelistis quorum nomina titulis praefiguntur; It is manifest
that the New Testament written in Greek by the Apostles or Evangelists, were
theirs whose names are prefixed to the Titles; And it cannot be doubted (says
he) that the Apostolical editions are of highest authoty, unless it could be
proved that they were corrupted, of which I have reason to think the same as of
the Hebrew Copies, viz. that neither they nor the Greek are generally
corrupted; and this (says he) may be easily demonstrated; for there never
wanted Gatholickes which did discover the endeavors of those heretics that
sought to corrupt them, and did not permit those sacred Scriptures to be
depraved. Thus he; wherein he speaks as much like a Protestant as those that
make the Objection: and indeed when we hear the complaints of the Greek
Fathers in those Primitive times, sounding loud against those bold and busy
Heretics, as Ireneus against Marcion, Origin, Chrysostom, Eusebius,
Epiphanius, Theodoret, etc. against the Arians, Macedonians, Manichees,
Valentinians, Nestorians and others, they showed themselves careful and
faithful shepherds, in watching and withstanding those morning-Wolves.
Bellarmine notes, that Ambrose did so by the Arians, who from John 4th. took
away Spiritus Jo. 4. v. 24 Ambr. li. 3. de Spiritu sancto. c. 11.
est Deus, (for so the Vulgate read it) which all the Greek books have (says
he.) So that although those vermin did impair some of those books, yet seeing
the Fathers of the Church did hunt them out of their lurking places, and
observed all their haunts, and through Gods providence, by their care did
prevail to preserve the greater number of those books pure and entire, which
were so owned and received by the common consent and practice of the Church, I
know not what any adversary can say against the authority of them. Take these
instances of the watchfulness of those Ancients; Origin notes that those
Heretics took away that in Romans 16. 25. Ei qui potens est, etc. which (says
he) was in other copies that had, not suffered by them.

Theodoret speaking of Tatian, says, Ego inveni Lib. 1. Haret. fab. tit. de
Tatiano.
plusquam ducentos hujusmodi libros, I found more then two hundred depraved
books, which were had in honor in our Churches, which when I had gathered, I
caused them to be laid aside, and in their stead I placed the four Evangelists;
for, as he says, this Tatian had composed a Gospel which he called the Gospel
by four, leaving out the Genealogies, and whatever does prove that Christ
descended from David according to the flesh; which Gospel not only those of his
sect did use, but such also who following the Doctrine of the Apostles did not
discern the fraud, but in simplicity made use of it as a Compendium of all the
Gospels.

Dionysius Bishop of Corinth observed such endeavors, Dominicas Scripturas
nonnulli corrumpere Eusebius. l. 4. c. 22.
sunt cornati, Of many that would corrupt the holy Scriptures. And in truth
whatever the Papists say in the heat of dispure, yet in cold blood they all
prefer the Greek copies: So Brugensis; Sic esse legendum Graeca clamant, Thus
the Greek Exemplars vote it. The Divines at Lovaine. Ita in Graecis
exemplaribus legi: and by the Greek they do frequently correct their Latin
copies; So Maldonat on Matthew 6. 5. where the Latin read, qui amant, the
Greek, (...), for they love, in this place; I judge (says he) that our copies
ought to be corrected rather then the Greek; So Stapleton: Where the Latin
read, Prompt. f^r. 3. Hebd. S. 4. Luk 22. 22
Sanguis qui pro nobis fundetur; (i.) the blood that shall be poured out for
us, the Greek reads in the present tense, the blood that is poured out: these
words (says he) are to be read in the present tense according to all the
Evangelists in the Greek text. So Faber on John 1. 30. The Latin read, Qui
ante me factus fuit; (i.) who was made before me; the Greek (...) is only fuit,
was before me; unhappy Arius would admit no other Exposition, (says he) that
he might belch out his madness against us, and confute us by an Interpreter,
which he could not do by the truth. Bellarmine himself says, the Fathers do
teach every where, that we Lib. 2. de Verb. Dei.
must have recourse to the Greek and Hebrew Fountains; Vega, Ribera, Vives,
Costa, and others, do acknowledge the same; and whereas some of them have
sifted the Greek books, to discover corruptions in them, Chamier, Glassius and
others, have sufficiently vindicated them.

Secondly, the constant interpretations of the Text by the Greek Fathers (with
whom many of the Latin do agree) according as it is in the Greek copies, is an
argument that they are preserved pure, and entire; for seeing these sacred
books were written originally in Greek, it was more facile for the Fathers of
that Church to find (which doubtless they did seek) the best copies, then for
any others.

And secondly, supposing they had greater helps to find, and obtain, we cannot
in Charity deny them care and integrity to preserve them entire from all
corruption, addition, or detraction; for they were not ignorant of that curse,
Revel. 22. 18. neither (as in fact it appears) were they wanting in this
duty.

Thirdly, The Greek Churches which then owned these copies were of a far
greater number and extent then the Latin were; The Church of Asia, and
Palestine, the Greeks in Egypt, and Europe, with whom the Syrians also joined.
To which add

Fourthly, The providence of God, who would not permit the fountain of Holiness
and Truth to be depraved; which providence, as it did appear in preserving
those Oracles of God that were committed to the Jews, so doubtless it has,
and will appear in the preservation of the Mysteries of our salvation in the
New Testament to the end of the world; for I know not any promise, or
privilege that the Jews had in this respect above Christians: and seeing God
does require on our parts that we should captivate our reason and
understandings to the Doctrines and Truths therein revealed, it is but
reasonable to think, that God will certainly preserve them in their integrity
and purity. And if the Jews, who have been professed enemies to Christ and
Christian Religion ever since they had a being, have been so wonderfully
withheld from corrupting the Scriptures of the Old Testament, in those things
that concern our Savior, his Nature, Person, and Offices, which they have
always had more then a good will, but never power to do, how can it be supposed
that the Greek books of the New Testament, which have always bin in the
custody, and under the care of most of the Churches of God, who in all ages
have had men of great ability, sidelitie, and vigilancie to preserve them,
should be corrupted?

And thus we pass on in the second place, to enquire, that seeing there are
many Greek copies some of which do hugely differ from others, yet all of them
pretend to Antiquity, and Purity, which of these are the most authentic; and
in this also we shall be directed by those that are the greatest enemies to
them. Sextus Senensis Biblioth. l. 7. p. 565.
thus; Dicimus eum Gracum codicem qui nunc in Ecclesia legitur, etc. We affirm
this Greek book which is now used in the Church to be the very same which the
Greek Church had in the times of Hierome, and long before, even to the days of
the Apostles, which is true, sincere, and faithful, not polluted by any
falsitie, as the continual reading of all the Greek Fathers does plainly show;
for Dionysius, Justine, Irenaeus, Melito, Origin, Affricanus, Apollinarius,
Athanasius, Eusebius, Basil, Chrysostom, Theophylact, and other Fathers before
and after the time of Hierome, do use one and the same Text of Scripture. Now
that all these should be so deluded, as not to know the corrupt copies from the
true, and by their inanimadvertency purchase a curse to themselves, and intail
it on their posterity, no rational man can think, if he consider how near they
were to the Apostles days, what abilities they had, and what courage for the
cause of Christ (besides the tradition of the Church, which is an Argument
against the Papists) and the actings of divine Providence to the contrary. And
Saint Hierome tells us, it was the practice of the Epistola ad Sunn^am and
Fr^telliam.
Church in his time, In N. T. si quando apud Latinos quaestio oritur, etc. If
any controversy do arise among the Latins concerning the New Testament, and
there be variety in the Latin copies, we presently fly to the Greek
fountains; and although some Greek copies did anciently differ, as possibly
they might within a few Centuries of years, yet the difference being but in
words and letters rather then sense, and the Church still retaining those which
did agree, with one consent and common practice, there cannot be a more
probable Argument of their authority and perfection. Besides, seeing those
ancient Greek copies, which by the Primitive Church have been delivered to us,
do keep the same Analogy of faith and truth among themselves, it is an argument
they were not corrupted by those Heretics whose malice aimed at the most
precious truths. But when any particular Greek copy goes against the generally
approved ones, and is faulty in any of the more important truths, that copy may
be suspected as spurious or corrupted: thus the corruption of the Arian copies
discovered it self in corrupting those places that did in Christo hominem a Deo
separare, separate the Divinity from the Humanity of Christ, as Jo. 1. 30. 1
Jo. 5. 7.

Our third inquiry is concerning the authority of those Greek copies,
especially that of Beza, which differ from the rest: Brugensis says of his
second copy, which has some difference from others, Latinae editioni contra
alia omnia consonat, etc. that it agrees with the Latin Edition against all
others, and sometime with its Grand errors, Erroribus ejus inolitis.
and was almost wholly conformed to the Latin. So Erasmus of the Greek copy in
the Vatican; Exemplum illud ante paucos annos confectum esse tempore Concilii
Florentini, cum facta est concordia Latinae Ecclesiae cum Graeca; This copy was
made not many years since, in the time of the Florentine Council, when there
was a peace made between the Latin and Greek Churches.

Then for Beza's copy; Mr. Gregory tells us, Gre. Notes chapter penult.
that it was the Opinion of those two learned Bishops, Armagh and Worcester,
that it had been corrupted by the Heretics; and that which he intimates
concerning its faultiness in the Genealogy, is an argument of it. But it may
suffice to give you his own judgment concerning that copy, as he delivers it
in his Epistle to the Universitie of Cambridge, to whom he presented it:

Quatuor Evangeliorum, and Actorum Apostolorum Graeco-Latinum exemplar, ex
Sancti Irenaei caenobio Lugdunensi, ante aliquot annos nactus, inutile quidem
illud, and neque satis emendate ab initio ubique descriptum, neque ita ut
oportuit habitum, (sicut ex paginis quibusdam diverso charactere insertis, and
indocti cujuspiam Coligeri barbaris alibi adscriptis notis, apparet) vestrae
potissimum Academiae, ut inter vere Christianas vetustissimae, plurimisque
nominibus celeberrimae, dicandum existimavi, Reverendi Domini and Patres, in
cujus Sacrario tantum hoc venerandae (nisi forte fallor) vetustatis monumentum
collocetur; etsi nulli vero melius quam vos ipsi quae sit huic exemplari fides
aestimarint, hac de re tamen vos admonendos duxi, tantam a me, in Lucae
praesentim Evangelio, repertam esse inter hunc codicem and caeteros quantum vis
veteres discrepantiam, ut vitandae quorundam offensioni, asservandum potius
quam publicandum existimem, In hac tamen non sententiarum, sed vocum
diversitate, nihil profecto comperi unde suspicari potuerim a veteribus illis
haereticis fuisse depravatum; imo multa mihi videor deprehendisse observatione
digna, quaedam etiam sic a recepta Scriptura discrepantia, ut ramen cum veterum
quorundam, and Graecorum and Latinorum Patrum scriptis consentiant; non pauca
denique, quibus vetusta Latina editio corroboratur: quae omnia, pro ingenii mei
modulo, inter se comparata, and cum syra and Arabica editione collata, in
majores meas Annotationes a me nuper emendatas, and brevi (Deo favente)
prodituras, congessi, etc.

This copy was found at Lions in France, during the civil wars there, in the
year 1562. of whole Antiquity the chief mark that Beza gives, is, that it has
barbarous notes affixed to it; whereas the Grecians have been more barbarous in
these later centuries then in the former: nor does he say much for the
authority of it.

For first, he says it differs from other ancient copies, especially in Saint
Lukes Gospel, so much, as that for fear of giving offense he thought it fitter
to conceal then publish it:

And secondly, that some things in it differed from the received Scripture, but
so as it agreed with the Writings of Greek and Latin Fathers:

Thirdly, that it did in many things confirm the old Latin Edition.

And this last, I take it, is no great argument of its authority or purity.
Solomon Glassius suspects that it was corrected by the Latin; for, as
Brugensis had said of his second copy, that it was so conformed; Quidni de
antiquis Beza codicibus, si qui fuerant, asseri possit? the same (says
Glassius) may be affirmed of Beza's.

And surely were not our Scriptures a more sure word then either the writings
of Greek and Latin Fathers (I speak without any disparagement of them;) or if
we had not a more pure and perfect copy of the Scriptures then the vulgate
Latin, we should not build on so sure a foundation, as now by the mercy of God
we do. Besides, Beza's copy differs from all others, as in many things
throughout, and especially in Saint Luke, so even in this Prayer, retaining the
word (...), debts, for (...), trespasses; which no other Greek copy does.

But I shall use another medium, because it is pertinent to the business in
hand, to prove the imperfection both of Beza's Greek, and the Vulgate Latin
copies, which is this; If the Doxologie in our Lords Prayer, and those copies
that retain it, be authentic, then such as leave it out are not so: But the
Doxologie, etc. Ergo. The authority of the copies retaining it we have proved
already, and the verity of the Doxologie follows upon that: but yet, because
the truth is generally opposed by the Papists, and too much slighted by some
Protestants, I shall do my endeavor to assert it; And I will not dissemble who
they are, and what they say, that speak against it: Erasmus says, Taxanda est
illorum tomeritas, qui non voriti sunt tam divinae precationi suas nugas
assuers; Their rashness is much to be blamed, that were not afraid to annex
their trifles to this Divine Prayer: Kirstenius says, A pio quodam fidei
imbecillis tanquam nova precatio additafuit; (more modestly) that it was added
as another Prayer by some pious man, but of a weak faith. Brugensis says, that
it crept into the Greek of St. Matthew from the Liturgies of the Greek Church.
Grotius says the same; and Beza calls it Magnificam and long sanctissimam --
Sed irrepsisse in contextum, and quae in vetustissimis aliquot codicibus
Graecis desit: Here is much said by great men, but Magna est veritas, truth is
great, and will prevail.

To these things therefore thus I answer; that Erasmus is not much to be
confided in in this business; for he gives an easy consent to the expunging
that of 1 John 5. 7. which so plainly proves the Doctrine of the Trinity, and
that upon a weak ground, because some Greek, and some Latin books have it
not; the authority of which place has been irrefragably asserted by Gerhard
in his dispute upon it.

But I shall prove this particular also ex concessis, from premises granted by
the Papists themselves, viz. the authority of the Greek books.

And first, take the testimony of Brugensis, (though our enemy in this
particular) who speaking of the Doxologie, says thus; Coronidem istam quae
subsequitur in Graecis plerisque and Syriacis libris, etc. That clause which
follows in most of the Greek and Syriack books we omit, and Erasmus and
Bellarmine grant, that it is generally in the Greek books; to whose authority
you have heard their assent: Solo. Glassius tells us particularly, that it is
in the ancient and correct copies of Henry Stephens, and Aldus De textu N. T.
p. 149.
Manutius, and in others that are most ancient and approved. Beza says the
same, that it is in the Syriack and in most Greek copies. And again, Variae
lect.
Brugensis says of one of the Greek copies at Paris, which omits the
Doxologie, that it was corrected by the Latin, because; says he, in this
place, and in diverse other, all the Greek books add what the Latin omit; and
so does the Syriack interpreter, and the Greek Fathers, as he there observes.
Laurentius Valla says, Nihil hic erat Graecis additum, sed a Latinis
detractum; (i.) Nothing was here added to the Greek, but omitted in the Latin
books. And so Solomon Glassius; Quis Glassius p. 150.
vero nos, quove argumento certos reddat, etc. But who can assure us, or by
what argument, that it was rather added to the Greek, then subtracted from the
Latin? seeing (as he quoteth from Helvicus) that the Greek is the fountain,
the Latin are the streams, this the daughter, and that the mother, by which
therefore it ought to be corrected; and he thinks the Vulgate Latin
inexcusable for maiming our Lords Prayer, as it does in St. Luke, which he
thinks a sufficient argument to justify the Greek copies against it in other
particulars: So that if I may speak ingenuously what I think, although Beza
made very good use of his copy in his Annotations, yet he seems a little too
zealous in building the reputation of it on the disparagement of the many
ancient Greek and Syriack copies that retain it; which, because they differ
from his, he says they had those particulars supplied (Olim) long since,
(which was indeed ab initio from the beginning, as has been proved:) but the
Papists greedily swallow this concession, and vomit it forth against
Protestants, as Huntly the Jesuit does; See Glassius p. 151.
I shall therefore make my restringent the stronger, by adding to the
testimonies above the reasons for the authority of the Doxology.

1. Because it is extant in the Syriack translation, which is of greater
antiquity and purity then any that wants it can pretend unto; of this Brugensis
says, Hoc teneo indubitanter, This I firmly believe, that the Syriack text of
the New Testament Comment. in N. T. n. 6.
ought to be had in esteem and honor with the ancient Greek exemplars: And
Franzius says; Omnes eruditi, etc. All learned men do De interp. Scr. p. 45.
assert the purity of this above all other versions, which holy men did
therefore so esteem, because Christ did speak and preach in this Language; so
that without doubt the Apostles and Apostolical men did diligently inquire, and
conserve the formal words of Christ, and by a pious labor did record them in
this translation; and moreover, they did most happily translate the Apostolical
Epistles, seeing that these Syriack Doctors held frequent converse with the
Apostles themselves. And in p. 38. Of all the translations of the New Testament
the Syriack is the chiefest, most sure, Idem. p. 38
happy, and divine, compiled without doubt by Apostolical men, which best knew
the words of Christ and his Apostles, and their sense of them also, being fresh
in memory, for this Language Christ did use; and for this cause wise men would
even equal it with the Greek fountain: See also what Tremelius says of it in
his Preface to the New Testament. And Chamier tells us, the Syrians did use the
Doxologie in their Liturgy as well as in the Gospel.

2. Maldonate confesses that it is in the Hebrew Mald. Preface. chapter 5. Of this
opinion were Irenaeus, Athanasius, and Baronius, as in Bellar. de verb. Dei, l.
2. c. 7.
copy also; and he attempts to prove that St. Matthews Gospel was originally
written in Hebrew, and urges St. Hieroms testimony, who had seen and made use
of the Hebrew copy; and therefore he concludes it to be (not a temeritatis) a
note of rashness, to deny it; and answers Objections to the contrary: if this
be true, it must needs be authentic, however the antiquity of this Hebrew
copy is beyond St. Hieroms time.

3. It is also in some Arabic translations; in that printed by Erpenius, and a
manuscript in Queens College Library: Certain it is that many of the books of
the New Testament were translated into this Language in the Apostles days,
yea, it is said, that they have certain Epistles of St. Paul, and other
Apostles, which are not yet extant in any other Languages; that St. Paul
himself Franzius p. 39.
was among them, appears from Gal. 1. 17. and this will help to justify it
against the Vulgate also.

4. The learned Mr. Gregory gives two reasons Ubi supra.
more for its authority; the first is, that it was used by the Christians in
Lucians days, long before any of those books that omit it were extant.

5. Because in all probability, as our Savior had respect unto the prayers of
the Jews in all other parts of his prayer, so had he also in this; and it
appears, that as they used the last Petition, so they annexed the Doxology unto
it, as, Libera nos a malo, quia tuum est regnum, and regnabis Sepher Hammussar
9. 12.
gloriose in secula seculorum; (i.) Deliver us from evil, for thine is the
Kingdom, and thou shall reign in glory for ever and ever.

6. Its conformity with the analogy of Faith throughout the Scriptures of the
Old and New Testament, is an argument (in the judgment of Chamier uses this
Argument.
Sol. Glassius) that it is authentic, who thinks that our Savior had respect
to a like clause, 1 Chronicles 29. see also 2 Timothy 4. 18. and sure I am it could not
serve the design of any Heretic to insert it.

7. The Prayer it self would be less perfect without it, and therefore it was
not originally wanting: the Council of Trent says; Orationis De partibus and
gradibus Orat.
Dominicae duae sunt parts, there are two parts of the Lords Pray Petition
and Thanksgiving: and, as Morton says, Lest we should deprive God of one part
of his worship, which consists of thanksgiving, this clause must be annexed;
for though the two first Petitions, Thy Kingdom come, etc. seem to imply
thanksgiving, yet is it not actually performed except in the Doxologie.

Having thus confirmed the Protestant Tenet, we shall also confute the Papists
Objections against it.

1. Bellarmine objects, that the Latin Fathers do not expound it when they
open all other parts of the Prayer.

To this it is briefly answered, that this will conclude nothing against its
authority, seeing the Greek Fathers, who in the Primitive times were more, and
had more advantages to know the truth, did retain it in their Expositions: for
as Chamier says, Non a Latinis ad Graecos, sed a Graecis ad Latinos scripturae
pervenere; The Scriptures were not delivered from the Latin to the Greek, but
from the Greek to the Latin Fathers.

2. He says, Graeci in sua liturgia recitant quidem Bellar.
haec verba, etc. The Greek Liturgies do recite these words after the Lords
Prayer, but do not continue them with the Prayer.

To this Chamier Answers; That they did continue L. 12. c. 13 S. 31.
it with the Prayer (as in St. Basil, and St. Chrysostom appears;) and it was,
the order of the Church then that the Priest only should pronounce it; which
also is an argument of its authority, the most solemn offices being always
performed by them. So Montanus; Sacerdoti Montan. in locum.
duntaxat licere verba ista proferre; It was lawful for the Priest only to
pronounce these words: and so Master Gregory, the (...) is always the Priests;
and it would be a strange inference, to conclude, that therefore it was less
authentic, or that it was not originally in the Greek books. Yet again Huntly
says, Istis Verbis respondebat Populus Sacerdoti^i post orationem Dominicam:
That in the Greek Liturgies the people did answer the Priest in these words.
But whether both of these be true or false, they will conclude nothing against
the authority of this clause, as will appear in answer to the next Objection.

Some Protestants do join with the Papists, objecting that this clause was
inserted into the Greek Obje. 3.
copies from their Liturgies: So Brugens. Verisimile fit; etc. It is probable
that this clause was added by the Grecians out of their Liturgy, or some other
solemn form, into the Gospel of Matthew; as also out of some such form, these
words are added to the Angelical Salutation, (...), Luke 1. 28.
Because thou have born the Savior of our souls. But by the way, be it known,
that we Protestants disown any such surreptitious addition to that place of St.
Luke in the copies which we follow; and therefore the Objection concludes not
against them or us upon this account. But to go on with the Objection, in
which Grotius agrees with Brugensis, thus; Seeing Matthew. 6. 13.
this clause is not extant in some ancient Greek exemplars, but is in the
Syriack, and Latin, and Arabic, it is an argument, that not only the Arabic
and Latin, but the Syriack translation also were made after that the Liturgies
of the Church had received a certain form; for this Doxologie, (rather then a
part of Prayer) was annexed according to a custom of Greece altogether unknown
to the Latins. And what Beza says you have heard already, that it did creep
into the context, etc. And he and Grotius will not grant the Amen to be
Canonical, but that both it and the Doxology came in as a thing in use among
those Primitive Christians. Thus I have made the most of the Objection, and
shall now do my best endeavor to answer it.

And first, whereas the Objectors suppose that the Doxology crept in from the
Greek Liturgies Answ. 1.
into those many and ancient copies; it will undeniably follow from this
supposition, that the use of the Liturgies and public form of Prayer was of
Apostolical authority and antiquity; for so are many of the Greek, Syriaeck,
Hebrew, and Arabic copies that do retain this Doxology; to say nothing of the
Latin, which Grotius also mentions.

And whoever he be that agrees with the Objectors in this supposition, cannot
possibly be at any great distance with me in my main proposition; for if
public Prayers were by Apostolical practice used in the service of God in
other forms, then this form was used by them much more, there being not any of
those supposed, or real Liturgies, which did not use our Lords Prayer as a
chief office of devotion.

2. It is an uncharitable and high presumption for any to think that those
Apostolical men that penned those holy books, should be such profane, daring
persons, as to harbor any thought, much less actually to attempt, the mending
of our Lords Prayer, when not only their care and diligence to prevent the
like practice from others, but their fidelity to the Gospel and truths of
Christ, which they maintained with the expense of their blood and lives, is so
apparent to all; certainly if they had Liturgies so anciently The Latins are
guilty of this, as Grotius notes on Matthew. 6. 13. In Latin is codicibus ex
rituali Latino multa adhaeserunt.
(which I think my present adversaries will not grant, or if they do, we shall
be adversaries no longer) they would rather have reformed their Liturgies by
the Gospel, out of which indeed the materials of them were taken, and not the
Gospel by their Liturgies: And though they used many forms in their devotions
as frequently as this Doxology, which they did also immediately annex and
insert to portions of Scripture used in their Liturgy; yet we never find them
guilty of annexing or inserting them to the holy Writ, as the (...), Glory be
to the Father, after the Psalms, and the (...), to the Angelical Salutation;
Surely whatever succeeding ages were, they were not so unfaithful to the great
depositum of the Gospel, as to consent unto, much less to be contrivers of, and
actors in the corruption of it, by any additions, or otherwise. It may with
much more charity and probability be thought, that this clause was in progress
of time omitted by the Latin Translators as a thing of form, and daily use,
which none could be ignorant of, or forget; as when we transcribe any thing of
accustomed forms we write a part, and supply the rest of it with etc. and this
Doxology was not only used to the Lords Prayer, but from thence added to other
parts of devotion also, and so became most familiar; this I say may be more
charitably thought, then that those most ancient, unquestionable Writers,
should purposely without any reason or design, with high presumption, and a
heavy curse (which was but even then pronounced, being almost the last words
of the Scriptures,) add it unto the holy Gospel: besides, these did only
transcribe it Rev. 22. 18.
from Greek to Greek; and every one knows there is less danger of error in
transcribing then in translating; there will likely be somewhat lost in tossing
liquors from vessel to vessel, by the most steady hand.

And that all that guilt which I wipe off from the Greek transcribers may not
stick on the Latin translators (whoever they were,) I shall offer (with
submission to better judgments) this conjecture, as the ground why they did
omit the Doxology, which at best was but (pia fraus) a pious fraud.

I read in St. Ambrose, after he had expounded P. 178. to. 40.
the rest of our Lords Prayer thus; Quid sequitur? (says he) Audi quid dicit
Sacerdes, Per Dominum nostra^ Jesum Christu^, in quo tibi est, cum quo tibi
est, honor, laus, gloria, magnificentia, potestas, cum Spiritu Sancto a
seculis, and nunc and semper in omnia secula seculorum. Amen. (i.) What
follows? hear what the Priest says, Through Jesus Christ our Lord, in whom,
and with whom, be unto thee, together with the holy Spirit, honor, praise,
glory, magnificence, and power from all ages, both now and always, for ever
and ever. Amen. Now plain it is that the Latin Church did use this clause with
the Lords Prayer, and that it was pronounced by the Priest; as also that it was
fitted by that Church to maintain the Doctrine of the Trinity, which was by
many contradicted. So that my opinion is, that having first left out the
genuine and proper clause of our Lords Prayer in their Liturgies, and
established this in the place of it, as most conducing to the ends they aimed
at; and being so settled, in progress of time they did omit the true Doxology,
to gain the more credit to this new one; and when (as all learned Protestants
know) there were many corruptions, and additions, and omissions too, in the
Vulgate Latin, even in those days, which St. Hierome himself did note, but
not amend, Ne Epist. ad Damasum.
nimis multa immutasse videretur, Lest he should seem to change too many
things; no wonder if this were past over among others. And we know also that
the Latin Church has not for a long time upward been so tender of the
Scriptures as they should: Cardinal Hosius was not Tilenus ad Bellar. de verb.
D. l. 2. c. 14.
afraid to write, melius actum fuisse cum Ecclesia; si nulla unquam Sciptura
extitisset. It might have been better with the Church if none of the Scriptures
tures had ever been extant. And seeing (as Grotius Grotius on Matt. 6. 1.
observes) they did add to the Gospels out of their rituals, it is likely they
did omit also from the Gospels. Then for the word Amen, which is not in Beza's
copy, and is disliked by Grotius, who says it was not added by Christ, but
came in from a custom of the Church, which did approve their prayers by that
word; this that learned man only says, for what he alleges afterward will
prove the contray, that the word is used in the Old and new Testament; Now this
Deuteronomy. 27. 15. 1. Cor. 14. 16. Variae Lect. Lat.
word is also retained in the Latin; and Brugensis (who in the business of the
Doxology opposed us) says of this word, Syriacum manuscriptum Graecique omnes
libri quos vidi, etc. The Syriack manuscript, and all the Greek books that I
have seen, do conspire with these Latin ones that have it. Hierome with
Euthemius elegantly expound it, calling it Signaculum Dominicae Orationis, the
Seal of the Lords Prayer, as it is a note of confirmation; so he teaches in
two Epistles to Marcellinus: and the Apostle uses the word, 1 Cor. 14. 6. See
this great Scholar urges the same Argument for it which Grotius urged against
it. Now if Beza's copy, and those few others which only in some things consent
with his, be true, then the many ancient, and generally received and approved
Greek, Hebrew, Syriack, and Arabic copies, which differ from his, but agree
among themselves, are false; or if these be true, as, I hope; appears to every
impartial person, then his is false in this particular of the Doxology; and if
it be faulty in St. Mattehw, much more in that of Saint Luke (as himself grants
in his Epistle) and especially in omitting those several parts of our Lords
Prayer, which those more ancient copies retain. And here I may also conclude
with reverend M. Crook, That the Doxology is causelessly and without warrant
omitted by the Church of Rome

And now we come in the last place to inquire Guide to Blessedness.
after the rise and authority of the vulgate Latin, upon whose credit both
Beza and Grotius do dissent from the most and best copies, and from the
judgment of almost all Protestant Divines: concerning the intireness of our
Lords Prayer in Saint Luke, Beza says, Haec non legit vetus interpres, ut
apparet ex Augustino; The ancient Interpreter (viz. the vulgate Latin) does
not regard these things, as appears out of Augustine: and so Grotius, Cum non
extet in Latinis antiquis illud; Because it is not in the ancient Latin,
therefore he suspects it was not in the Greek. But the reading of the Latins
will not at all prejudice the more constant and unanimous readings of the
Greek, if we consider the rise and authority of it.

1 There were in the Latin Church, in the time of St. August. and Hierom,
diverse Latin Editions, besides that which is now called the vulgate, some of
which did agree much better with the Greek; but this was most approved by that
Church: This especially was so miserably corrupted, that Pope Damasus sent to
Saint Hierome, to amend it by the Greek: and accordingly he sets about the
work, not to Bellar de v. D. li. 2. c. 9.
translate it de novo (that the Pope would not have) but to correct it where
the greatest faults were; and how he did that himself tells us in his Preface
to the Evangelists, Ita in hac commendatione calamo temperavimus, ut his tantum
quae sensum mutare videbantur correctis, reliqua manner permitteremus ut
fuerant; We have so guided our pen in this Edition, that amending only those
things which did seem to alter the sense, we have suffered other things to
stand as they were: and this was his rule as well in the translating the Old
Testament, as in correcting the New; Quod semel aures hominum occupaverat, and
nascentis Ecclesiae roboraverat fidem, justum erat etiam nostro silentio
comprobari. (i.) That which had once possessed the ears of men, and had built
up the faith of the growing Church was justly approved by our silence; and upon
this account he past over many things which he knew did greatly need amendment.
So that the groundwork of this edition is an old vulgar Latin, used by Pope
Damasus, amended in some few things by St. Hierome, but to this day differing
from the Greek copies, which translation was not received into the Church
until Gregory's time, (i.) about two hundred years after Saint Hierome, as
Bellarmine says; this is the rise of it: now concerning its authority, hear
what Bellarmine says, Mirifice, etc. All the Heretics (i. Protestants) do
wonderfully agree against the Romish Church; and the Lutherans and Zuinglians,
(so he names the Calvinists,) urge this against its authority, Innumerabiles in
ea deprehenduntur errores, That innumerable errors are found in it; and this,
as it has already, and may more largely be proved by the Papists, and
especially by comparing the vulgate Latin with that of Montanus his
interlineary version of the New Testament, so more especially from the
observation of Protestant Divines; for although Sixtus Quintus boasted much of
his Edition, how many things he had reformed, yet Dr. James reckons 2000
faults mended Bellum Papale.
in that Edition by Pope (lement the Eighth, and yet this Pope says modestly,
diverse things were still to be amended; and the Council of Trent did take some
care for the effecting of it, but still Brugensis observes six hundred faults
more; and when Bellarmine saw Brugensis his emendations, he sends him this with
his thanks: You may know that the vulgate Bibles are not accurately mended by
us, for many things are purposely past by which seemed to need amendment, which
for just cause we did not amend; this cause is so secret, that we cannot judge
how just it is.

But I remember Bellarmine falls foul with Calvine for saying of the vulgate
Edition, Adeo nullam esse in vulgata editione integram paginam, nt vix tres
sunt continui versus non insigni aliquo errore faedati, That the vulgate
Edition is so far from having any entire page, that it has scarce any three
continued verses free from some gross error: This holds true of the New
Testament as well as of the Old.

Whatever Bellarmine, Huntly, and other Jesuits have said in defense of it,
has been confuted by Chamier, Chemnitius, Glassius, and others: One argument
of Bellarm. for the defense of it I cannot but take notice of; Because (says
he) it has been used by the Latin Fathers for a thousand years: this makes
little for the authority of it, if we consider the reason that he himself
gives why the Latin Fathers did so generally use this so faulty a
translation, in his fourth argument, viz. that few of them did understand the
Greek, he instanceth in the six hundred Latin Bishops at the Council of
Ariminum, whereof not one (Nemo fuit) understood the Greek word (...); for when
the subtle Arians propounded to them, An vellent Christum colere (...), they
all answered, nolumus (...), sed Christum. But what if the Latin Church and
Fathers have used it for above a thousand years? such a prescription as that is
not a sufficient warrant for us to believe and practice all that was then
believed and practiced; and when no Protestant does acknowledge it to be a
convincing proof that the Greek reading of the Old Testament is therefore
authentic above the Hebrew, because the Apostles themselves did use it, much
less will the use of the vulgate by the Latin Fathers convince any of its
authority above the Greek, wherein the several books were first written, and
which do generally accord in all necessary truths, especially in the things
which we have now controverted: and Bellarmine says, Plus credendum uni testi
loquenti quam mill nihil dicentibus, One witness that speaks out a truth is
rather to be credited then a thousand that say nothing. As for its purity,
having said some things in general from the writings of those that make it
their Diana, I shall only add a few particulars; the absurdity of which
should long since have made them intolerable among Christians.

Thus Luke 15. 8. the vulgate reads (evertit Evertit pro everrit.
domum) the poor woman having lost a piece of silver, etc. overthrowes her
house, instead of sweeps it: as the word is also used Luke 11. 25. So Luke 16.
22. mortuus est Dives, and sepultus in inferno, they read thus, the rich man
also died and was buried in hell; whereas Montanus reads as we do, and ends
that verse thus, the rich man also died and was buried. Romans 12. 19. Non
vosmetipsos defendentes, they read, Not defending your selves; the word
signifies not revenging your selves: They seem to make a great improvement of
the precept, but how contrary their practice is, the Mysteries of Jesuitisme
lately printed will inform us out of their own authors; 1 Pet. 2. 23. where our
Savior is said to have committed himself to him that judges righteously, they
read, se injuste judicanti, that judges him unjustly. This taste is enough to
make us know how much that impure vessel has tainted the precious liquor of
Gods word; and yet the Papists will not permit the people to drink at the
Fountain, but only at these impure streams. Huntly says, Nos Graecum textum
corruptum esse pronunciamus, praesertim ubi dissentit a vulgata nostra; We
pronounce the Greek Text to be corrupted, especially where it dissenteth from
our vulgate Latin: but I hope that the premises which we have laid down will
bear this conclusion, That the Greek copies ought to be consulted and believed
by us, both for the determining of controversies, the understanding of
difficulties, and for the entire and pure delivery of the truths of God. And
Franzius de interp. S. p. 47.
thus we have proved the Doxology in St. Matthew to be authentic, and the
forms in both Evangelists to be entirely the same, though delivered at several
times, only in Saint Luke the Doxology is not added; whence will arise
ano-Objection:

The form in Saint Luke, which is most strictly Obje. 4.
enjoined, is less perfect; and the quere will be which form ought to be used.

To this I answer, that it is usual with the later Evangelists to deliver those
particulars more briefly which had been insisted on more at large by the
former; thus in an important cmmand, v. 33. of this Chap. Seek the Kingdom of
God and the righteousness thereof, etc. St. Luke reads only this, seek the
Kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added: and this is also the
method observed Matthew. 6. 33. Luke 12. 31.
by the Evangelists, as to repeat some things already delivered more briefly,
so to express other things omitted more plainly; and it seems it was the aim of
St. Luke to express the word of precept and injunction for the using of this
form, so as that it should admit no contradiction: But I remember that this
Prayer was twice delivered, and so our Savior himself might here in Saint Luke
repeat it more contractedly to his Disciples alone, who, we may suppose had all
recorded and learned it throughout; or at least, that St. Luke might abbreviate
it, as a thing sufficiently known from St. Matthews relation. But however it
be, when two forms are prescribed, we need not dispute which we should use,
much less may we deny to use either: but as it is our duty to use one, so it
will be our sin to omit both: and our own prudence, and the practice of the
Church in all ages may direct us to use that which is most perfect. And our
Assembly gives the same advice in a like matter; for whereas the Apostle
differs from the Evangelist in the form of words used at the Institution of the
Lords Supper, which in St. Matthew 26. 26. is, Take, eat, this is my body; and
at the cup, Drink ye all of it, for this is my blood of the New Testament which
is shed for many for the remission of sins: But in St. Paul thus; Take, eat,
this is my body 1 Cor. 11. 24.
which is broken for you, this do in remembrance of me: and at the cup, This
cup is the New Testament in my blood, this do you as often as ye drink it in
remembrance of me. The first are Christ's own words according to St. Matthew,
and St. Paul says also, That he received of the Lord that which he delivered
unto the Corinthians; yet, as there is a necessity of using one of those forms,
so the Directory gives us liberty to use either. The same advice will hold in
this business of the two forms of Prayer: One we are bound to use, we have
liberty to choose which; but Christian prudence directs us to use that which is
most complete; and Chemnitius assures us that the ^arm. p. 1988.
Doxology which is wanting in St. Luke, may be piously supplied from St.
Matthew, and then there is not the least difference in the forms.

That all our Prayers ought to be made in knowledge Obje. 5.
and understanding: But these Petitions are either obscure in their terms, or
comprehend such mountains of matter and mysteries under each expression, as the
common sort of people cannot actually apprehend under such brief expressions.

Having proved it to be our duty, by virtue o Christ's command, all objections
for the non performance of it, arising from our own incapacity, will be found
to be but vain pretenses, an such is this.

For first, I beseech the Objectors to consider, what our Savior was doing
when he delivered this Prayer; he was instructing, not only his Disciples, but
the whole multitude also, in the chief parts of Gods worship; wherein he no
doubt descended to the capacities of them whom he intended to instruct, and did
not now speak in Parables, as at other times, but proposed plain truths, to
guide their spirits, and raise their affections in Prayer, and other exercises
of Religion: And I cannot think any man as good a Master of Method, or a
plainer teacher then our Savior.

2. They that have not a competent degree of Knowledge to apprehend the prime
sense of each Petition in this Prayer, if they be Ministers, they are not
sufficiently qualified to utter Prayers ex tempore in the Congregation; or if
they be people, they are less able at one and the first hearing, to understand
all the uncouth words, and mysterious expressions of those that do so pray
before them.

3. The prime and literal sense is obvious, and easy to be understood by every
ordinary capacity; but if there be any thing difficult, there are few
established Ministers but are able to expound it; and were all Ministers as
diligent in unfolding the Method and heads of this Prayer as the ancient
Fathers were, and as it is their duty to be, this Objection would soon vanish.

4. That which the whole Assembly makes an argument to commend the use of it as
a form, namely, the comprehensiveness of it, is but unhappily urged by any one
or more inferior persons, against the use of it as such.

5. This Objection would condemn the use of any Petitions wherein the
Attributes of God are mentioned, and any Scripture-purase (to which more senses
then one may be accommodated) is used; and as the Jews say, there are
Mountains of Divinity on every point of Scripture.

6. Nor indeed is it necessary that we should in every Prayer have an actual
apprehension of every particular that may upon deliberation be referred to each
head of this Prayer, but only of such things as we do stand in need of, and
for the supply of which we do at that time make our addresses to the throne of
Grace; and if we should stand to enumerate our particular wants, to confess our
several sins, and to implore grace against each infirmity, in every Prayer, it
is not a day that would be sufficient for these and such like things. And it it
not in vain that our Savior has said, Your heavenly Father knows what
things ye have need of, so immediately before this injunction, Matt. 6. 8.
Thus therefore pray ye.

7. This Objection is so like that which the Papists make against the use of
the Scriptures by the Lay People, that one egg is not more like another, viz.
Because in them are some things hard to be understood, therefore they permit
them not to converse with them, and to use means, and lay hold on opportunities
to understand them better; It is great pity that the excellency of things
should render them useless, that the exemplary justice and goodness of
Aristides, should be the ground of his banishment. Besides, suppose the people
be ignorant of the proper sense of one or two Petitions, it cannot charitably
be supposed that they are ignorant of all; and their ignorance of some
particulars will not be a sufficient excuse for the total omission of this
duty, no more I think then if a man should plead, I am not in perfect charity,
I am dull and indisposed, therefore I will not pray; though such a one may sin
in his prayer, yet he sins more in the wilful omission; and it is better to
pray in a sense of our infirmities and unworthiness, which still accompany us,
then not to pray at all, because we cannot in some things justify our selves.
Doctor Preston makes Prayer the best preparation to Prayer, and Saint James
commends it as a good mean to obtain spiritual knowledge; If any man James 1. 5
lack wisdom, let him ask it of God, and it shall be given him.

If this Prayer be so positively enjoined, then it ought to be used as the only
prayer, at least it should Obje. 6.
be added to all other.

Affirmative precepts do always oblige us to Answ.
the performance of them, but not to the actual exercise of the duties enjoined
by them at all times. Thus when we are bid to pray continually, we may as well
conclude that we ought to do nothing but pray, (for which opinion the Euchites
1 These. 5. 17.
and Messalians were accounted Heretics) as to infer from hence that we ought
to use this form only, or this at all times of prayer: and so from that
Precept, verse. 6. of Matthew 6. we might as truly infer, that all but closet
-prayers are unlawful, because Christ there says, when thou prayest enter into
thy closet; whereas we might rather infer, that as our Savior commended closet
-prayers to his Disciples, to distinguish them from hypocrites, who were wont
to pray chiefly in the streets and high ways; so he commends this form, to
difference them from the heathen, and to be as a cognizance of their
Discipleship, to be used pro hic and nunc, on solemn occasions in public, and
once a day at least in private, as is implied in the fourth Petition.

2. Supposing (as some contend) that our Savior had enjoined this Prayer as a
platform only, as then there would have been no necessity of conforming every
occasional Petition to the whole method and frame of it, but it should have
served as a rule by which to conform our more solemn Devotions; so now our
public prayers being framed by it, we ought to apply the form it self to these
especially, as a rule to discover their rectitude or deficiency, and to supply
their imperfections; which if it were duly done as often as we worship God in
public, it would be as salt to season our Devotions, and give the people
assurance that we have done according to the pattern in the mount; it might
cover a multitude of infirmities, and commend our Devotions to God and man.

And lastly, it might prove an effectual mean to revive that Unanimitie and
Charity which has so long been cold and dead amongst us.

When I have kept close to the matter of this Obje. 7.
prayer in my devotion, it is but a vain repetition to say over the form.

If those that fail in observing the matter Answ.
and method would use the form, (and the use of one of these is undoubtedly
their duty) the far greater part of our Ministers would use it.

2. There can be no great danger in saying our prayers too often, whether in the
same or other words. Our Savior repeated the same words three times when he
was in an Agony, Matthew 26. 44. O my Father, if it be possible let this cup
pass from me. And if the same conceptions may be often repeated in other words
of our own invention, as is generally practiced, why may they not be once
repeated in Christ's words? To go from a less perfect form to a more perfect,
from our own to Christ's, is a good method. There is an Art taught by Saint
Paul, how to make an old prayer new, Phil. 3. 18. namely, by renewing our
fervent affections; Of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even
weeping, the increase of zeal, and fervor of spirit, will add new life and
efficacy to any prayer.

But we find our hearts dull and cold under this, Obje. 8.
as well as under other forms.

To this we may answer as the Apostle in another case, ye are not straightened by
this form, ye are straightened in your own bowels. It may Answ. 2 Cor. 6. 12.
be your hearts are stupid at the reading of the Scriptures, must that
Ordinance therefore cease? Mr. Ball tells us of one Smith, that would cast
reading of Scripture out of the Assembly, because in his opinion it quenched
the Spirit: But in such cases the deadness of our hearts is to be blamed, not
the form of Prayer, which is full of life and spirit; yet it is strange that
any man's heart should be active and fervent under one that prays a form to him
ten or twenty times to him as long, and presently grow stupid and cold at the
devout repetition of this form (perhaps) by the same Minister: Does the holy
Spirit assist you in hearing the Ministers form, and withdraw from you in
hearing this? no, doubtless; but as we may be edified by Psalms, and Hymns,
and spiritual Songs brought into forms by men, so much more by the use of this
form, composed, and enjoined by the Son of God. I should rather therefore think
that the hearts of those that have been dull, or disaffected, under the prayers
of the Ministers, should be quickened and elevated by this; as the drooping
Disciples going to Emaus, while Christ was speaking to them their Luke 24. 2
hearts burned; and so indeed the people in former days, by their more
reverend gestures, their cheerful and unanimous joining with their Ministers in
the use of this prayer, were wont to express their most hearty devotion.

And here we may observe, how little the enemies of the truth do agree; One
accusing it for being more large and comprehensive then their spirits and
understandings can apprehend; another, for that it does too much straiten and
confine their spirits, and make them flat and dull: which accusations, as they
cannot be both true, so without better proof we have no reason to believe
either.

But most men cannot safe y say this Prayer, Obje. 9.
they cannot call God Father, nor pray for forgiveness on that hard condition
(for such our Savior makes it) of being forgiven as they do forgive others,
lest they should do as Adonijah did, the words of whose Petition were spoken
against his 2 Kings 2. 23.
own life.

To the first part of the Objection, Dr. Lightfoot answers thus; They that
do deny this Answ.
Prayer is to be used by any but real Saints, because (as they say) none but
such can call God Father, either know not, or consider not, how usual this
compellation was among that Nation in their devotions; and Christ speaks
constantly according to the common and most usual Language of the Country; And
if Christ did from the common practice of the Jews insert it into his own
prayer, it argues his approbation of it too in the common devotion of
Christians.

2. To both parts of the Objection I Answer, that every man that would pray
fitly and acceptably in the congregation, or in his closet, ought to follow
this prayer as his Rule and Directory in observing the matter of it at least,
if not the form also, (otherwise Christ has made it a form and rule in vain:)
Now I say, if our keeping of the form be dangerous, so is our observing the
matter too; and then by this reason, if the most of men may not pray in this
form, neither may they pray according to this matter; for as no solemn prayer
should be made without asking God forgiveness, so no forgiveness can be
expected without the Matt. 6. 15.
condition of forgiving, our brethren: it is as Montanus says, Praecisa and
irrevocabilis sententia sine exceptione, a general and unalterable rule without
exception, If ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Heavenly
Father forgive your trespasses. And what a vain excuse this will be in the ears
of God, I did not pray nor ask pardon, because I could not call God Father,
nor forgive my brethren, or because there were some in the Assembly that had
not faith to call God Father, or charity to forgive their brethren, every
Christian ear can try.

But if this be the reason why some have so long omitted it, let me mind them
of what our Savior told some of his Disciples, Ye know not what Luke 9. 55.
spirit ye are of: Now the frequent use of this Petition would lay on new and
strong Obligations upon all persons, to perform that most excellent Christian
duty so much wanting among us, of a free and full forgiveness of our brethren;
to which religious practice, it is well if by any Art we could oblige our
people; yea this very terror of the Lord, which is here put into our own mouths
of obtaining no forgiveness from God, but on condition of forgiving others,
would effectually persuade us to it, or else keep us under a tacit sentence in
our own consciences of being Excommunicated from the throne of Grace, and of
receiving no benefit by all our prayers. And suppose there be some such in each
Congregation as cannot, or at least will not join with the rest in saying this
Prayer, must the rest of the Congregation be deprived of the benefit of it for
their sakes? It may be all the Ministers Prayers may not be as suitable, and
profitable to the most and best of the people, as this; and it is a sad thing,
if a Minister shall comply rather with the weakness and malice of a few, then
with the devotion and benefit of many. The use of holy and honest things is not
to be laid aside, because some are causelessly offended at them, especially when
the greater part are justly prejudiced at the omission.

And finally, this also is to be considered, that the yielding to scrupulous
and contentious persons in lesser things, (although I account this one of the
greatest magnitude) is the way to harden them in their present prejudices, and
to dispose them for more and greater.

Amicus SOCRATES, Amicus PLATO, Magis amica veritas.
THat which Dr. Owen has said concerning Dr. Owen p. 667.
the use of this form, is, in his Answer to Beedles 11. Questions, and the
Answer thereto.

Beedles Question is this; Did not Christ prescribe a form of Prayer to his
Disciples, so that there remains no doubt touching the lawfulness of using a
form?

To this he answers, Luke 11. 1, 2, 3. To this thus replieth:

Dr. Owen. If Christ prescribed a form of Prayer to his Disciples, to be used
as a form by the repetition of the same words, I confess it will be out of
question that it is lawful to use a form.

Reply. But Christ did prescribe a form of Prayer, etc. Therefore it is lawful
to use a form. The minor Proposition is chiefly to be proved, and the
conclusion, (viz.) the lawfulness of using a form (indefinitely) which is that
which Beedle contends for, and the Doctor here grants, will be of considerable
importance hereafter. Now the truth of this Proposition will appear by the
proof of its parts, thus: Either it is not a form, or not prescribed to be used
as such; but it is a form, and prescribed to be used as such; Ergo. That it is
a form is granted by all, and made the apple of contention by most that disuse
it under that notion: but the rottenness of this assertion is so apparent, that
the next scruple is added, as a leaf to cover it, (i.) whether it is prescribed
to be used as such: This, although it be sufficiently clear, cannot be seen by
those who have entertained the former prejudice, for being professed enemies to
all forms of Prayer, they are resolved to make it good that our Savior was no
friend to them; which is contrary to his own practice, (as has been showed)
and against a double precept also, in as plain expressions as could be used to
that purpose. But none are more unlike to discern the mind of God in the
Scriptures, then they that sift them rather to find or fancy something in them
to confirm their opinions, then to direct and settle their judgments:
otherwise they that observe, and use a form of words prescribed in the
administration of both Sacraments, might with the same eyes observe this also
prescribed for use in prayer: But

2. It is also granted that there is a plain and positive prescription
preceding this form, When ye pray, say, And thus pray ye. And I never heard as
yet that any have questioned the sufficiency of the injunction; about what then
is the contest? this; they fancy, that the matter only of that form does fall
under the prescription, and not the form of words. So that the truth of both
assertions is granted in sensu diviso, (viz.) that there is a form, and a
prescription, but not insensu composito, that that form is to be used as such,
by virtue of this prescription. But what God has joined together let no man
put asunder; for the decision of this I will make my appeal to any impartial
person, as Judge: when there is a form composed by Christ himself, and
commanded to his Disciples with a plain precept prefixed, viz. When ye pray,
say, how unreasonable it is to affirm that the prescript should concern the
matter, or the method only, and not the form of words also? Quis discrevit?
what sufficient cause of divorce between these two can be assigned? or what
reason has any to distinguish, where the Law of God does not? had the Disciple
asked our Savior thus; Master, teach us what things to pray for, give us some
heads of Devotion, then this inference might have some color of truth; but
even then our Savior giving and prescribing a form with the matter, it would
have been hard measure to exclude the form of words from the prescription, when
Christ had included it: The proposition being thus confirmed, the conclusion is
granted by the Doctor, viz. that out of question it is lawful to use a form:
this Beedle infers -- The lawfulness of using a form (indefinitely,) and in
this the Doctor gratifieth him; which we do here observe, because the Doctor
presently withdrawes, saying, His Conclusion must be; that, that form ought to
be used, not at all that any else may.

Dr. Owen. But that is lawful not to use a form, or that a man may use any
Prayer but a form on that supposition, will not be so easily determined.

Reply. This is the Doctors Argument; If it be lawful to use a form of Prayer,
then any other prayer: But a form is unlawful. As if forms and non-forms were
as irreconcilable as light and darkness, or Christ and Belial; I know none
that uses forms, so to Idolize them, as to condemn the use of Extempotary
prayer, especially in secret, to which they do earnestly exhort all Christians
to aspire, as to a degree of perfection in their devotion; neither their
principles nor their practice will own this conclusion, of condemning all
prayers that are not forms as unlawful: We who account it lawful to read the
Scripture in the form that we have received it, do not make it unlawful to
meditate and comment, to write or read pious and learned discourses,
expounding the sense of it.

The people may be holy in a sense as well as the Priests, although not so
solemnly consecrated; this Prayer indeed, like its Maker, is anointed with a
holy Oil above its fellows, but yet that Oil (as from Aarons head) runs down to
the skirts of his garments, to every private extemporary Prayer and ejaculation
that is breathed out of a contrite heart.

Prayers are not therefore lawful or unlawful, because they are forms, or
extemporary; the Spirit may assist each, and either may be performed without
the assistance of the Spirit: Therefore, as Saint Paul said in another case, 1
Cor. 14 15.
I will pray with the Spirit, and I will pray with the Understanding also; So,
I may pray by a form, and I may pray ex tempore also.

Dr. Owen. The words of Christ are, When ye pray, say, Our Father, etc. If in
this prescription, not the Matter only, but the Words also are attended, and
that Form of them which follows is prescribed to be used, by virtue of this
Command of Christ, it will be hard to discover on what ground we may otherwise
pray, seeing our Saviors Command is Positive, When ye pray, say, etc. (This is
the Center to which many of the Doctors Lines do tend.) That which Master
Beedle is to prove, is, That our SAVIOR has prescribed the Repetition of the
same words ensuing; and when he has so done (if he can) his Conclusion must
be, that, that Form ought to be used not at all, that any else may.

Reply. There is a plain Non sequitur in this Argument, (viz.) If this Form be
lawful, then the other forms are unlawful: The Standard was a rule to all
other measures, were other measures therefore which agreed with the Standard
unlawful? It is indeed the perfection of other prayers to be as like this, both
in matter and form, as may be; the contrary might indeed be more rationally
inferred (viz.) If this form be prescribed and lawful, then other forms
(especially prescribed ones) are lawful also; which consequence seeing the
Doctor did with good reason grant, we will take him to his word, not because we
need it, or shall account it as a gift, but because we have right and just
title to it: Indeed if the whole mass of form had been corrupted, and our
Savior had chosen and sanctified this one only, the Doctors consequence had
been good; but seeing they were originally lawful, and prescribed by God
himself in the Old Testament, and many of them approved by our Saviors
practice, as well as this by his positive precept in the New: it seems harsh
Doctrine (pardon the Expression) to leave them all under an absolute
irrespective decree.

In a word, our Savior did not prescribe that which was unlawful before, to
make it lawful, but that which was lawful to make it necessary. Besides,
Christ does not enjoin this Prayer (exclusive) as if it were unlawful to add
other; but (eminenter) as a visible Character of being his Disciples, to be
used occasionally (pro hic and nunc) as a token that they owned him for their
Master, and were constant in the Faith delivered by him.

Dr. Owen. If our Savior have prescribed us a form, how shall any man dare to
prescribe another? or can any man do it without casting on this, the roproch
of imperfection and insufficiency?

Reply. Our Savior having prescribed us a form, it is a dutiful, no daring
thing to follow him in so plain and practical a part of Piety; we ought to
conform all our Devotions to this pattern in the mount: They certainly are the
daring spirits that neglect and slight this prescribed form.

All grant that we ought to conform our prayers to Christ's; this then will be
the question, Whether it is lawful to meditate and study that our prayers may
be comformable to his, or to presume of such a conformity at an adventure: If
you say (as all sober Christians will) that study and meditation are requisite,
I rejoyn, study and meditation to compose our prayers, and conform them unto
Christ's, is the constituting of them forms; therefore if study and meditation,
etc. be lawful, other forms of prayer are lawful, and being lawful, the
prescribing of them to such as need them, for helps to their Devotion, does not
make them unlawful.

Suppose I should argue from the Doctors supposition (viz.) that it is the
matter only that is prescribed, thus; If the matter of this Prayer only be
prescribed, then the prescribing and using of any heads or matter of prayer,
more or less then are in this prayer, is unlawful; I should not conclude
rationally, nor piously, but cast a reproach on many devout supplications of
private Christians, and on public Forms and Directories too: But certainly the
framing of our Petitions like to this, is to honor it as our rule, not to cast
reproach on it as imperfect and insufficient; let them look to that who reject
the use of it, and are so much enamoured with their own forms (for forms they
are to all but themselves) as to abandon this.

But it is natural to us to see a mote in a brothers eye, and not to consider
the beam that is in our own; If they reproach it that conform to it, and in a
conscientious obedience to our Saviors prescription repeat it in the same
words, and apply it to their own prayers to supply the defects of them, what do
they that pronounce the saying of it (which is prescribed) to be ridiculous,
and a charm, and question whether the saying of these words, which Christ and
his Evangelists have put into our mouths, be a part of the worship of God, or
whether any promise of acceptance (no matter with what affection and devotion
it be said) be annexed to the saying so? and many such things, the mentioning
of which will be a sufficient confutation. But I forbear, and close with
Master Ball, who first grants it is a form, and adds; The principal use of it
is to direct all Gods People to make their Prayers by it.

Dr. Owen. Our Savior has prescribed a form of prayer to be used as a form
by repetition of the same words; therefore we may use it, yea, we must use it,
is an invincible Argument, on supposition of the truth of the Proposition: But
our Savior has prescribed us such a form, therefore we may use another, has
neither show, nor color of reason in it.

Reply. He must either wilfully shut his eyes, or have a weak sight, that
cannot discern more then a color of Reason in this consequence, (viz.) Our
Savior has prescribed us one form as lawful, therefore we may use other
forms lawfully: for surely our Savior did not prescribe any thing which was
(in genere suo) unlawful. Indeed the contrary inference is strange, and hard
to be proved, (viz.) Our Savior has asserted the lawfulness of one or more
forms, therefore all others (not so asserted) are unlawful.

When it was prescribed at a solemn Fast, that Joel 2. 17.
the Priests should say, Spare thy people, O Lord, etc. Is it reasonable to
think that they made use of no other prayers, (as of David's penitential
Psalms, and the like) but only of that short form there prescribed; or that
they did offend in so doing? Or what if any should argue thus; Our Savior has
prescribed us this form, therefore those in Hosea, Joel, etc. are unlawful to
be used?

The Primitive Christians saw more then a color of Reason in this Consequence,
when on this very ground, because Christ gave his Disciples a form of Prayer,
they did with study and meditation compose their public devotions after this
Example. So Tertullian; Praemissa legitima and ordinaria oratione quasi
fundamento jus est desideriorum, jus est superstruendi extrinsecus petitiones.

The lawful and ordinary prayer being premised, it becomes the rule of all our
desires, and of raising all our Petitions upon it: and Mr. Ball, who makes it
a form says also that Christ admits all Languages, Words and Forms
agreeable to it, whether read, rehearsed by heart or presently conceived: And
Espencaus observes the same, Ducta est hinc Ecclejiae consuctudo Deum P. 1025.
precandi, and precibus instar ejus quam constituit and composuit Dominus
utendi. From this practice of our Savior the Church has grounded her practice
of praying unto God, and using such Prayers, as the Lord did appoint and
compose.

Dr. Owen. But how will Master Beedle prove that Christ does not here instruct
his Disciples in what they ought to pray for, and for what they ought in prayer
to address themselves unto God, and under what considerations they are to look
on God in their approches to him, and the like, only, but also, that he
prescribes the words there mentioned by him to be repeated by them in their
supplications?

Reply. The task which the Doctor sets Mr. Beedle to prove in the Negative,
should have been proved by himself in the Affirmative; and I think it will be
sufficiently difficult to demonstrate, that the matter and heads of Prayer, and
the method and considerations by and under which we are to call on God, (cum
multis aliis) and other such things, are all of them, and only prescribed, and
yet the form it self not intended, especially if the context in Saint Luke be
heeded, Lord teach us to pray, as John also taught his Disciples, that is, (in
the judgment of many learned Divines already named, to whom I shall add
Espencaeus, Doce nos orandi formulam) teach us a form of Prayer. But the Doctor
essays the De collectis Ecclesiastisis. p. 1025.
proof of this by telling us:

Dr. Owen. That whereas in Luke 11. Christ bids his Disciples say, Our Father,
etc. this in Matthew 6. is, Pray after this manner, (...), to this purpose.

Reply. The importance of the (...), thus, in Saint Matthew, as well as the
(...) in Saint Luke, has been already considered; and the reason of expounding
Saint Matthew, by Saint Luke, and not Saint Luke by Saint Matthew, sufficiently
asserted against any thing that has yet been leaded for the contrary.

Dr. Owen. I do not think the Prophet prescribes a form of words to be used by
the, Church, when he says, Take with you words; but rather calls Hos. 14. 2.
them to fervent supplication for pardon for sin, as God should enable them to
deal with him.

Reply. Bernardus non videt omnia: Calvine was of this judgment; non de
quibustibet verbis hic loquitur Propheta, sed mutuam esse relationem In locum.
inter Verba Dei and bominum ostendit; ubi ergo ita ex ore Dei sumimus verba,
and afferrimus ad ipsum, hoc est sumere verba. The Prophet does not speak here
of any words, but shows the mutual relation between the Words of God and the
words of man; when therefore we do thus take words from the mouth of God, and
bring them to him, this is to take words. So our Annotators [words] that is,
say they, from Gods mouth, and to be spoken to him: and again [say In loc.
unto him] he dictateth as it were the solemn form and manner of their
conversion. Doctor Reynolds has observed these two parts in this Text:

1. A general Instruction. 2. A particular Form.
And it is easy to observe, as an Exhortation and Directory for prayer in the
former words, viz. O Israel, return unto the Lord thy God, etc. so a set form
in the following words, Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciously, etc.

Hutchinsons third Note on this Verse is; Our words in prayer ought not to be
such, or so ordered as we please, but God is the prescriber of our prayers,
whose directions we are bound to follow; for so much does this direction given
by him teach. After consultation with these, and some other Authors, my
thoughts are, that the faithful people of God then living, having received from
an undoubted Prophet of the Lord a prescribed form of prayer, whatever other
prayers they did use besides, they did most certainly use this also. And that
which the Doctor adds, viz. that God calls them to fervent Supplication as
he should enable them to deal with him; does not overthrow, but rather confirm
the Prophets prescribing a form of words to be used; for seeing Gods ordinary
way of inabling his people was by directions given to his Prophets on their
behalf, by whose Ministry the Lord puts words in their mouth, as here, and in
Joel 2. It had been great presumption in them to have neglected the
dispensation of the Spirit by the Prophet, which with great Faith and
confidence they might have used in the prescribed words, and to have expected
it by an immediate impulse on their own spirits in an extraordinary manner.

Dr. Owen. And though the Apostles never prayed for any thing, but what they
were for the substance directed to by this Prayer of our Savior, yet we do
not find that ever they repeated the very words here mentioned, or once
commanded or prescribed the use of them to any of the Saints in their days,
whom they exhorted to pray so fervently and earnestly.

Reply. This Argument concludes nothing, being merely Negative; and it would
certainly brand the Apostles with a note of disobedience, as well for not
observing the heads and matter of this Prayer, as for omitting the form; for we
do not hear or read of any public or solemn Prayer of theirs, wherein the
matter and method was fully observed; may we therefore conclude, that they
followed Malum ex causa patiali, bonum non nisi ex causis integris.
neither matter nor form? If any one defect be enough to denominate a thing
evil, and nothing is good but what has all its due circumstances attending, I
do not see how those more solemn public Prayers can be so highly excellent
which are hudled up without any respect to this, either as to matter, method,
or form, and perhaps carry not the sense of more then one or two Petitions,
though they exceed it almost an hundred times in length.

But as for Apostolical practice, there are many credible authorities among the
ancients to induce us to believe that they did frequently use it, as Saint
Augustine, Gregory, etc. nor can the bare denial of any one or more ut supra.
modern and prejudiced persons overthrow their testimonies; or at least such a
way of Arguing would raze many fundamentals of our Religion.

As for their commanding or prescribing the use of these words to others, I
cannot think so uncharitably of the Apostles, as to conceive they omitted this
duty, seeing our Savior gave them in charge, To teach the people all things
whatsoever he commanded Matt. 28. 20. Acts 20. 20.
them; And the Apostle says, He had kept back nothing that was profitable
unto them.

And as in criminal Causes, where there wants clear Evidence concerning
matter of Fact, Judgment may justly be pronounced upon evident and pregnant
Circumstances concerning the same; So in this cause also.

Dr. Owen. Nor in any of the rules and directions that are given for our
praying, either in reference to our selves, or him by whom we have access to
God, is the use of these words at any time in the least recorded to us, or
recalled to mind as a matter of duty.

Reply. This was done twice by our Savior in a most solemn manner, and what
need there should be of a third repetition by the Disciples, I know not; when
the master had so authoritatively prescribed it, what weight could the servants
Fiat add? doubless this double command was enough to oblige them, nor will any
good servant expect more then a twofold injunction to do his duty; It is
safer by far in a business of this nature, to obey, then dispute the commands
of our Superiors.

Dr. Owen. Our Savior says, when ye pray, say, Our Father, etc. on
supposition of the sense contended for, and that a form of words is prescribed,
I ask whether we may at any time pray and not say so?

Reply. Without doubt we may; Our Savior bids when we pray to enter into our
closets; Quere whether we may at any time pray and not enter into our closets?
Who doubts of this?

Again, our Savior bids us when we pray to observe the matter and method of
this Prayer; Quere, whether we may pray at any time, and not entirely observe
the matter and method of this Prayer? yes, we do, and may, both alter the
method, and omit many heads of the matter in our occasional Petitions.
Affirmative precepts bind us to the actual performance of such duties as are
enjoined by them, only pro hic and nunc, as occasion shall require. But yet
when I consider that this Prayer is by our Savior adapted to public devotion,
and was given to his Disciples to be used as a Cognizance to whom they did
belong, I am somewhat of the Doctors mind, that we may not at any time pray
publicly and not say so.

Dr Owen. Q. Whether the saying of these words be a part of the worship of God?

Reply. That words are a part of the worship of God, who requires the service
of the outward as well as of the inward man, is undeniable; Quia verbis
aliquando in oratione opus est, nulla commodior est oration quam quae a Domino
tradita and praescripta est. Chenmitius
and what words can lay better claim to this privilege then Christ's own? If
the varying of the matter of this Prayer into expressions of our own be to
worship God, then much more to present the same matter in Christ's words; for
our alteration of the words may invert the method, and change the sense: and
certainly the use of these very words (other requisites in Prayer being
adjoined) is as solemn and acceptable a service as any we can do God and our
Savior Jesus Christ. Hoc modo verba illa sunt incitamentum devotionis, p. 785.
Verba coelesti patri and nota and grata. Idem.
When God bid the people, Hos. 14. 2. to take with them words; and the Priests
in Joel 2. 17. to say, Spare thy people, etc. it would sound harsh to make a
Quere whether the saying of those prescribed words were a part of the worship
of God. If the praising of God, and praying unto God in the words of David be a
part of Gods worship (as undeniably it is) then much more the praying unto God
in the prescribed words of Christ.

Dr. Owen. Or whether any promise of acceptance be annexed to the saying so.

Reply. Our Savior was never yet reputed so hard a Master, as to enjoin a
Duty, and not to imply or express a promise of acceptance. Every precept
virtually carries a reward with it; In keeping of them, says the Psalmist,
there Psalm. 19. 11.
is great reward. What better promise then the forgiveness of sins? yet this
Christ annexeth to the due performance of the duty, in one of the Petitions;
For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive
Matthew. 6. 14.
you: and why is that Parable in Saint Luke adjoined so immediately to this
Prayer, which our Savior concludes thus; Ask, Luke 11. 5.
and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find, etc. but to assure us,
that God will accept of their devotions who importune him Certi simus quando
bane precationis formam reddimus, not tales preces coelesti Patri propenere
quae ipsius Filii sacratissimo ere sunt benedicta, as proinde certam
exauditionem speremus. Chemnitius.
their heavenly Father according to the manner and matter prescribed? And when
there is no Psalm or Prayer in Scripture, either of David, or any other, though
it be not enjoined, but the use of it (debita cum reverentia) has its
acceptance, there is no reason to question the acceptance of this which is
prescribed.

Let us sincerely perform the duty, and we may confidently trust God with the
reward, whether expressly annexed or not: yet, if, as Saint Cyprian says, there
be a promise, Verily, Jo. 16. 23.
verily, I say unto you, whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will
give it you; how much rather if unto his name we add his words also?

Dr. Owen. Whether the Spirit of Grace and Supplication be not promised unto
all believeers, and whether he be not given to enable them to pray, both as to
the matter and manner.

Reply. All persons that have the grace of Materiam dat gratia, materiaeque
Ingenium cultus induit, arsque ^odos.
the Spirit have not the gift of utterance, and of a ready elocution; nor is
it the proper Office of the Spirit of Grace to dictate words, but to quicken
and raise the affections. The Spirit of God does not teach believers to despise
forms, nor always enable them to solemn devotions without the help of forms.
They who have their hearts enlarged toward God, whose very sighs and groans are
accepted, may yet (like narrow-mouthed vessels) not be enabled to express their
desires in a ready and composed manner: yea, there be many believers on earth,
and glorified Saints in heaven, who never were enabled to pray unto God in a
more public solemn manner, but by the help of composed forms: and Mayer
observes, that Catechism p. 425.
if a Minister have the Spirit, yet there is danger, through weakness of
memory, of omitting things necessary to be prayed for in the congregation; of
Excursions, and running out into Clauses impertinent and idle, and of
tautologies, repeating the same things again and again, to the wearying of the
hearers: and Plutarch observed the like danger in speaking ex tempore long
before him. But besides all this, the Objection lies as well against the
observation of the matter, as the form prescribed; for if believers are enabled
to both, they are not obliged to regard either.

Dr. Owen. And if so, whether the repetition of the words mentioned by them who
have not the Spirit given them for the ends before mentioned, be available.

Reply. The repetition of these words by them who have the Spirit, but are not
always enabled by that Spirit as to the gift of utterance, and a ready
composure, may certainly be available; for even they who have the gift of
utterance, as well as of the Spirit of Prayer, may effectually pray unto God,
in this, or in other forms composed by themselves, or others; and therefore
they that have the Grace, but want the gift of exercising that Grace
externally, may also; for if the Spirit of God do enable them to pray
effectually in their own forms, certainly that Spirit will not withdraw from
them when they address themselves to him in that form which was taught us by
his beloved Son, in whom he is well pleased.

Dr. Owen. And whether Prayer by the Spirit, where these words are repeated, as
to the letters and syllables, and order wherein they stand be acceptable to God.

Reply. Prayers by the Spirit of Grace, in whatsoever words, syllables, and
order, are acceptable; yet God is the God of Order also, but not of confusion;
and if the broken expressions of the weakest believer, then much more Prayers
by the Spirit in the words which our Savior has in great Wisdom and order
composed and sanctified, are acceptable to God; there are degrees of
acceptance.

Dr. Owen. Whether the prescription of a form of words, and the gift of the
Spirit of Prayer be consistent.

Reply. When Christ prayed in the words Matthew. 27. 46. Matthew. 26. 30.
of David, and sung a Hymn in the words of David, Quere whether the use of a
form of words, and the gift of the spirit of Prayer, be consistent. I am sure
beyond all scruple, that Christ never used any thing in Prayer himself, nor
commanded it to be used by others, but what was highly consistent with the gift
of the Spirit; and if the use of any one or more forms of Prayer in Scripture,
not positively enjoined, be lawful, and consistent with the spirit of Prayer,
much more that form of words whereof Christ is the prescriber, has a Benjamins
portion.

They who have the spirit of assisting them Quae potest esse magis spiritualis
oration quam qua vere a Christo data est, a quo nobis Spiritus Sanctus missus
est? St. Cyprian supra.
in their extemporary prayers need not doubt of it, when they study and
meditate for the composing of one or more forms to be used by themselves: and
indeed, the people who in the Congregations pray unto God in that form of
words in which the Minister goes before them, should never pray with the
Spirit, if the prescription of a form of words, and the gift of the Spirit of
Prayer were not consistent.

And why may it not be as well questioned, whether the Spirit of Grace be
consistent with a form of words in the administration of the Sacraments, as in
Prayer?

I aver therefore, that nothing is more consistent then such a Divine
Prescription of a form of words, and the Spirit of Prayer, for as much as the
prescribed words of God are that Chariot, and Jacobs Ladder, by which the
Spirit of God ordinarily descends into the hearts of men, and the souls of
men ascend up to God; and therefore to intimate an inconsistency of these two,
is as the dashing of the two Tables against each other, it is to oppose Martine
to Luther, and to sow discord among brethren; they have both one Father.

The gift of the Spirit of Prayer is either Internal, which we may call the
infused Grace; or External, which is the ability to exercise that Grace; which
ability is attained per modum habitus acquisiti, as an acquired habit, by
study, meditation, and frequent exercise; so that he who would fitly exercise
the Grace of the Spirit, is obliged to use such means as God has appointed to
enable him thereunto, (even as he who would exercise the gift of the Spirit in
preaching;) and this studying and reducing the gift of the Spirit into a form,
either of Preaching or Praying, does not extinguish, but cherish the Grace of
the Spirit, as Saint Paul's precept to Timothy does plainly teach; Meditate upon
these 1 Timothy 4. 15.
things, give thy self wholly to them, that thy profiting may appear to all.

And seeing it is likely that we may serve God better, and edify his people
more, by our premeditating, and studying both the matter, and expressions of
our Prayers, we ought to do it, unless we will adventure to appear empty before
the Lord, and to serve him of that which cost us nothing. The truth is, there
is an immediate infusion, and an assistance of the Spirit in an extraordinary
manner pretended unto in exemporary Prayers, as if there were a (dabitur in ea
hor a) a present enthusiasme given from above to supersede them from all study
and premeditation; which Opinion all sober Christians must condemn, or they
will cast a great prejudice upon the Devotion of all that have not a like
faculty.

I deny not, but ingenious and exercised persons, may by the Gift of God, and
the concourse of Natural causes and circumstances, have their spirits so
quickened, their faculties of inventing and disposing matter so improved, and
their delivering thereof in ready and significant expressions, so familiar, as
may become the public service of God; but still I say, he that can do this ex
tempore, may do much better with study and meditation, and that as well in
Prayer as in Preaching.

Dr. Owen. Whether the form be prescribed, because believers are not able to
pray without it.

Reply. The Apostles desire will in part resolve this doubt, Lord (say they)
teach us to pray; they were conscious of their own insufficiency, and yet were
believers; and indeed neither they, nor we could have prayed so regularly and
devoutly, as now we may, had not this form been recorded, And had that of the
Apostle been considered; All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is
profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Instruction in 2 Timothy
3. 17.
righteousness, that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished to all
good works; this Quere might have seemed superfluous: It may in a sort be as
justly questioned, whether the Scriptures be written, because we cannot be
instructed in our Christian Faith and obedience without them; for, Eadem est
ratio partium and totius. Seeing that Christ did prescribe it to teach his
Disciples, doubtless it 1 Cor. 10. 11.
was intended as a help of devotion for all them that should believe in his
Name, unto the end of the world.

Master Hutchinson in his fourth Note on Hos. 14. 2. speaks very pertinently
to this Quere; It may be (says he) the condition of Gods humble and exercised
People, that they cannot command their own dispositions, nor get their heaerts
brought into frame before God; in which case, however he abhor those that draw
nigh unto him with their lips, etc. yet they who Is. 29. 13.
are sensible of the backwardness of their hearts, ought not to stay away
because of that, but should come, if it were but with words to God, to seek of
him that he would give them more to bring unto him. So much for this (take with
you words) albeit they could command no more.

So that it is not derogatory to the glory of God, either to say that all
believers have great help to their devotions from this form, or that some
believers, at sometimes, need this or other forms of inferior rank, with
which they may go to God in Prayer; nor does it derogate from the efficacy of
the Spirit, promised and given to believers, because that spirit does not always
work the external faculty or gift of exercising Prayer, where it does infuse
the inward Grace; the most gracious heart may be joined with a slow tongue, as
Exodus 4. 10.
it was in Moses.

And where the spirit does work the gift, it is not by an immediate
inspiration, suddenly elevating the Intellectuals and Faculties of man to an
extraordinary degree of Invention and Elocution, but gradually, by Meditation,
study, and the use of means, especially such as are commended and prescribed in
the Word of God for that purpose; of which means this form is the chiefest, and
therefore most useful to teach believers for what, and how to pray.

Dr. Owen. Or because there is a peculiar energy in the letters, words and
syllables, as they stand in this form. And whether to say this be not to assert
the using of a charm in the worship of God.

Reply. I grant, that in bare words and syllables used in Prayer, and in opere
operato, the lip-labor only, there is not any efficacy at all: Saint Cyprian
says indeed, Agnoscit Pater verba Filii sui, that the Father will own his Sons
words, but it is when filial affections are joined with them in the suppliant,
else they have no peculiar energy with God.

But yet, as to man, whose affections are ordinarily wrought upon by words,
these words of our Savior may have a peculiar energy; for being sanctified by
his lips, they are more then common, and being so appositely fitted to the
matter, they are like to make the greater impression upon our understandings;
and being enjoined by our merciful Savior and Mediator, they have yet a
greater energy, because they raise the devout soul to a more confident
expectation of receiving the desired blessings, because as to the matter and
words they do not ask amiss: So Calvin; magnum Inst. lib. 3. c. 20. Sect. 34.
consolationis fructum percipimus, etc. We gather hence abundant fruit of
consolation, in that we know we ask nothing that is absurd, or strange, or
wicked, yea, nothing which is not acceptable to him, who beseech him in words
that came out of his own mouth.

And what if we should say with the Poet, Inest sua gratia verbis? Job says
the same, How forcecible are right words? and Solomon, Job 6. 25. Pro. 25. 11.
A word fitly spoken is like Apples of Gold in pictures of Silver: and the
Preacher is said to have sought out acceptable words; of which Eccles. 12. 10,
11.
words it is said in the next verse, they are as goads and nails fastened by the
Masters of Assembly: And holy Job speaks of choosing out his Job 9. 14.
words to reason with God; upon which Doctor Wilkins observes, that it is
amongst expressions, as with persons and things, some are choice and
beautiful, others refuse and improper.

And certainly, that injunction of Saint Paul to Timothy is very considerable
as to 2 Timothy 1. 13.
this, who bids him to hold fast the form of sound words which he heard of
him, that is, (says Master Calvin) not only the substance but the very form
of speech, for the word (...) signifies the lively representation of things,
by words properly accommodated to their Nature, which because none can be more
adapt and fit then the Penmen of the Holy Scriptures, therefore the least
declining from that form of words is dangerous; So that in these respects, the
words of this Prayer being deliberate, proper, and pertinent, they will leave a
strong and lasting Impression upon the hearers, and as Master Calvine says,
once again, Unigenitus Dei Filius nobis verba in os suggerit quae mentem
nostram omni haesitatione expediant; The only Son of God has put such words
in our mouths, as may clear our hearts from all doubtings. So that there is
certainly great reason to keep exactly to these words, because although there
be no peculiar efficacy in them, in respect of God, yet there may be in respect
of men; and therefore it is an unhandsome Expression, to name a charm with that
form of Divine words; God give us all grace to hear and obey the voice of that
Charmer, then whom never any charmed more wisely.

Dr. Owen. Whether in this respect the Pater Noster be not as good as Our
Father.

Reply. It is to him that knows the use of that Language every way as
effectual in Latin, or Greek, as in English; yet to him that wants true
devotion, there is much difference between the use of a prayer in a known
tongue, where possibly the expressions, and the necessary blessings desired by
him may inflame his affections, and in an unknown tongue, where in all
probability no such effect can follow; I think if we should preach all our
Sermons in Latin, and so pray before our people, we should do less good upon
the unconverted, then we may (by Gods blessing) in English.

There is utterly a fault, as Master Mayer Catech. p. 434.
observes, in those Popes that promise pardon for the saying of seven Pater
noster's, and as many Ave Maria's every day; and it is a fault too (as he
adds) so to detract from this Prayer, as to account (...) better, or not so
worthy as a man's own conceived Prayer; which is derogatorie and arrogant.

Dr. Owen. Whether innumerable poor souls are not deluded, and hardened, by
satisfying their Consciences with the use of this form, never knowing what it
is to pray in the Holy Ghost.

Reply. The right use of this form never deluded or hardened any; nor is it
easy to think how any that has in faith and knowledge used this Prayer,
should not also endeavor for other inlargements. Instruct a poor soul in the
right use of this, and there is no such method in the world to fit him for
praying in the Holy Ghost; and therefore to oppose the use of this form (under
a pretense of satisfiing the Conscience therewith) to pray in the Holy Ghost,
is no pious or laudable Artifice, as if this Prayer were exclusive of the Grace
of the Spirit; or as if that Holy Spirit had refused the waters of Siloah that
go softly, and chosen to reside in troubled waters and whirle-winds.

Dr. Owen. And whether the asserting this form of words, has not confirmed
many in their Atheistical blaspheming of the Holy Spirit of God, and his
Grace, in the prayers of his people.

Reply. Cujus contrarium: This I dare affirm with equal truth and confidence,
that not the asserting, but the disusing, and condemning this form of words,
has confirmed many in their Atheistical blaspheming of the holy Spirit of God,
and his Grace, in the Prayers of his People.

I offer this instance, which is notoriously known; When a Minister of God, of
great integrity and ability (for many such there be beyond all contradiction
that use this form) cannot repeat this Pryaer, but a great part of his
auditors, in some Congregations, instantly conceive an invincible prejudice
against both his Person and services, as if there were an impossibility of
being edified by them; Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? yea, and when
some actually withdraw from the Ordinance of Christ (as if the Preaching of the
Gospel by such men were foolishness indeed) this is not far from an Atheistical
blaspheming of the Holy Spirit of God and his grace in the Prayers of his
People; and this effect has not been produced by the asserting, but by the
laying aside the use of this form in our Prayers, as a fruitless carnal
ordinance, which has made too many of our people to conceit of it as so much
Collquiutida, that makes all the Service of God unsavourie.

And in my best observation I could never discover that it was the design of
those that assert this form, to cast any contempt Hanc veniam petimusque
damusque.
upon other well-ordered Devotions; although contrarily, the practice and
pleading against the use of this brings a certain disrespect both upon this
Form, and upon all other Prayers to which this is annexed.

But what if the asserting of a commanded duty do confirm some in causeless
prejudices? It is better that others be scandalized without our fault, then
Christ be disobeyed and dishonored by our fault. The preaching of the Gospel
is a rock of offense, and a savor of death to many; shall these evil effects
be charged upon the Gospel as the proper products thereof? God forbid! Indeed
the wilful neglect of an enjoined duty, and fixing of contempt upon a Precept
of our Savior, and upon the universal practice of his Church in all Ages, may
make wary Christians jealous of some other practices of such men; for we all
know, they have not the Spirit who despise the Word; and it is as well known,
that to speak against some opinions, and practices, which in our generation
pretend much to the Spirit, is neither Atheistical nor blesphemous; I suppose
therefore we may safely walk by this rule, Not to judge of our duty by the
event, but by the lawfulness thereof, and the authority of its prescription; If
any draw an ill conclusion from good premises, it is his fault, not ours.

When Christ has commanded a duty, we must do it, though all the world should
be offended at it: Fiat justitia, ruat coelum.

Dr. Owen. And whether the repetition of these words, after men have been long
praying for the things contained in them (as the manner of some is) be not so
remote from any pretense or color of warrant in Scripture, as that it is in
plain terms ridiculous.

Reply. That our Savior intended we should use other Prayers besides this I
doubt not; and what warrant the use of this has in Scripture, let every
Christian Reader judge: I am sure the reviling of this Practice has none.

And now, it is too apparent who it is that casts reproach on this Prayer,
when the repetition of it is in plain terms pronounced ridiculous; that stomach
must be very foul that nauseates manna it self: It cannot be adjudged
ridiculous in our Savior to prescribe this form twice, and how comes it to be
so to use it once? It was not ridiculous in him to use the same words three
times on the same occasion, Matt. 26. 44. Psalm. 136.
in a great agony; nor in David to bless God six and twenty times in the same
words annexed to other; Nor is it adjudged ridiculous to use frequent
variations of words on the same matter in our Prayers: nor when we have gone
over the heads of our Sermons more then once, to recount them again in our
Prayers; and yet when we have prayed to God, and being conscious of the
imperfections and failings of our Prayers both as to the matter and manner, do
continue them in Christ's own words, as a supply of those defects, this is
pronounced in plain terms ridiculous.

The Prophet speaks of some that have Psalm. 59. 7.
swords in their lips; such a sword is this thorough the sides of Christ's
Ministers teaches his own.

I end this with a note of Master Mayer; As a wrestler (says he) having used
his best Catech. p. 424.
skill and strength to over come in wrestling, yet finding the getting of the
victory to be very hard, he reinforceth himself at the last with all his
might, force, and skill together, that be may carry away the prize: So the
Christian man, wrestling as Jacob with God by Prayer, in the end reinforceth
himself in this Prayer, that he may not depart unblessed.

Dr. Owen. When Master Beedle, or any on his behalf has answered these
Queries, they may be supplied with more of the like nature and importance.

Reply. Not so much on the behalf of Master Beedle, as for the vindicating of
an Ordinance of our blessed Savior, and for the stablishing of wavering souls,
I have endeavored (according to my ability) to answer the Doctors Queries;
but I have not the least expectation of the supply that is promised although I
easily believe the Doctor may raise many more scruples, which (as he says) may
be of the like nature and importance: but seeing the Doctor has already
bestowed some time and labor in doing the cause of Christ acceptable service,
my humble advice is, that he should redeem all opportunity for those better
services, lest by opposing this one sacred Truth, he should hazard all that
credit which he has got in confuting so many dangerous errors.
