and Assigns in the Execution of his Office.
JAMES R.

WHereas Our dearly beloved Brother the late King was pleased by His
Proclamations to Signify His Pleasure for exempting from bearing Offices and
Quartering of Soldiers His Postmaster General and all Inn keepers, Victuallers
and other persons, who were actually Post-masters, Masters of the Letter Office
or Packet Boats, and employed by the Postmaster General or his Deputy in the
Grand Letter Office in London; We purposing to continue the said Privileges
and Exemptions, which We conceive to be for Our Service, are graciously
pleased, and do accordingly hereby Declare Our Will and Pleasure to be, That
no Soldier, Horse, Foot, or Dragoons be Quartered in the House of any
Innkeeper, Victualler, or other person, who is or shall be actually a
Postmaster, Master of the Letter Office or Packet Boats, and employed by Our
Postmaster General for the time being, or his Deputy, or some other Person or
Persons Commissionated by Us for the Management of the Office or Place of
Postmaster General, by Virtue of some Deputation or Commission from Our
Postmaster General or his Deputy, or such other Person, who shall be therein
Employed by Us, And that if any such Soldiers be already Quartered upon any
such Person as aforesaid, they be forthwith Removed from his House to some
other place. And Our further Will and Pleasure is, That Our Postmaster
General for the time being, his Deputies, Servants, and Assigns shall be from
henceforth Freed and Exempted and Discharged off and from Serving upon all
Iuries, Inquests, Musters or any other public Employments or Attendances, that
may any way Impede, Retard, or Prejudice the Execution of his or their Duty and
Service in the said Office, and from all Pains and Penalties, which he, they,
or any of them might or may Incur for or by reason of his or their Omission or
Refusal to perform the said Employments or any of them. And Our further Will
and Pleasure is, That all Our Officers both Civil and Military do take Notice
hereof and Conform thereunto accordingly.
