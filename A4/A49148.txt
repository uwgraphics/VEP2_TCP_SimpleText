A Looking-glass for a Tory; Or the Bogg-Trotter's. Glory
To the Tune of Hey Boys up go we.
THE Devil and we have done brave things,
No age can match the same;
We have disturbed the best of Kings,
Set England in a flame.
We Have made his Subjects almost mad,
A man that is blind may see
And yet we have escaped a gad'
Such crafty Knaves are we
We Swear this Hour and next deny
What we before had Sworn;
Both God and Conscience we defy,
Religion we do Scorn:
If we confess, the Priests forgive,
What sins so e're they be:
Like Devils on earth we mean to live,
Such Perjured Knaves are we.
We make new Plots to hide the old,
And thus we please the Pope;
Let us but have the Roman Gold,
We Will never fear a Rope.
We Will make old Tony Cooper know,
That we such pranks can play,
As shall give him a gentle blow,
The clean contrary way.
An Oath in Bonny-clapper dipped,
Goes nimbly down our throats:
We Will venture to be hanged or whipped,
For sixpence or two groats.
We fear no colors red nor blue,
Our wits are gone astray,
We go to Heaven (give us our due)
The clean contrary way.
Oh Cram a Chree the times are hard,
We know not how to live;
If that our Oaths should be debarred,
And Pope no Money give,
Why fait and trote dear Joy we must
With our Potatoes play,
And the English would preserve our dust,
The clean contrary way.
But by my Gossips hand a gra,
Our Priests have spurred us on,
And we will try to stretch the Law,
Before we will be gone;
We Will swear for shoes and throw our brogues
To the Devilon New Years day:
We know that none will count us Rogues
The Clean contrary way.
A Testimony Maker may
Spring up within a night,
We know that many a man will say,
A Mushroom's come in sight:
But let them rail and slight us now,
They shall our glory see,
The Devil and Pope our Trades allow,
Sing hey boys up go we.
If we could Swear the Pope again,
Unto the British Shore,
And see the English Rascals slain,
And tumbling in their gore;
Then every Teague would get his Land,
Rebels of each degree;
And we might with our Swords in hand
Sing hey boys up go we.
Now by Saint Patrick let us try
What man can Swear the best,
A Pox upon a Common lie,
Let Us swear above the rest.
Let Us swear that every Protestant,
Their Sacred King would slay,
And we shall rise let who will want,
The clean contrary way.
Let Us swear the Papists never did ill,
Since Mass was first in fashion,
That they had neither power nor will
To hurt the English Nation:
That they are as harmless as a child,
Which every man may see.
And when our Oaths have them beguiled
Then hey boys up go we.
Let Us Swear that God frey hanged himself,
Because he could not wed;
And then he forfeits all his wealth,
And the Plot will all lie dead.
Let Us Swear that these. Morocco blades,
Brought Oats but the other day
Upon their pretty Barbary Jades,
Though the clean contrary way.
Let Us Swear with all our force and might,
There was no Powder Treason,
And then one fasting day take flight,
You know it is but reason.
Let Us Swear the City never was burned
By Papists that did flee,
And then the stream will soon be turned,
And hey boys up go we.
