TO THE READER.
Courteous Reader,
THe divine and laudable Science of Astrology, is a Learning that teaches by
the Natures, Motions, Configurations, Significations, and Influences of the
Heavens and Stars therein, how to judge of future Contingencies, or predict
natural Events: the word Astrology, is derived from Astra and Logos, which is
as much as to say the Speech, reasoning or language of the Stars; and to this
we find the Psalmist consent, when he sings, the Heavens declare the glory of
God, and the Firmament shows his handy works: day unto day utters speech,
and night unto night shows knowledge: there is no speech nor language, where
their voice is not heard: their line is gone out through all the earth, and
their words to the end of the World: in them has he set a Tabernacle for the
Sun, which is a Bridegroom coming out of his Chamber^, and rejoices as a
strong man to run a race: his going forth is from the ends of the Heaven, and
his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat
thereof, Psalm the 19.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Thus being led by the signification of
the word, or appellation of this Noble Art, unto those places of Scripture
first; I shall now look back to the beginning of the Holy Writ, and so take
along in order several portions thereof, that farther prove the Stars to have
influence on all sub-lunary things, whether Animal, Vegetable, or Mineral; to
begin then, observe, And God said, let there be Lights in the Firmament of the
Heaven, to divide the day from the night: and let them be for Signs and for
Seasons, and for days and years: And let them be for lights in the Firmament of
the Heaven, to give light upon the Earth; and it was so: And God made two great
Lights; the greater Light to rule the day, and the lesser Light to rule the
Night; he made the Stars also: And God set them in the Firmament of the Heaven,
to give light upon the earth; and to rule over the day, and over the night, and
to divide the light from the darkness; and God saw that it was good, Genesis
the 1.14, 15, 16, 17, 18. And for the precious Fruits brought forth by the Sun,
and for the precious things put forth by the Moon, Deuteronomy the 33.14.
Again, they sought from Heaven, the Stars in their Courses fought against
Sisera, Judges the 5.20. Can thou bind the sweet Influences of the Pleiades,
or loose the bands of Orion, Job the 38.31. So likewise, says the Lord, I will
hear the Heavens, and they shall hear the Earth; and the Earth shall hear the
Corn, and the Wine, and the Oil, and they shall hear Jezreel, Hosea the 2.21,
22. Many more places might be produced, but these are sufficient to convince
any sober Person, that those glorious Bodies, were not by their Maker placed in
the Heavens only for ignorant people to gaze at; but to show forth his Almighty
Power, in their subordinate Rule and Government: And now seeing this their
Lordships is not managed by sensible and palpable acts and agitation, it must
needs follow, that they have a secret and hidden way of Rule, whereby they
operate imperceptibly in all their agitations of their Dominion: the Sun and
Moon indeed have their palpable effects, for the Sun is the Fountain of heat,
and that heat is the Nurse of Life; also his presence and absence causes day
and night: likewise his nearness to, and remoteness from our Zenith, together
with the nature of the Parts of Heaven he passes through, causes Summer and
Winter, heat and cold, alteration of days and nights: now the Moon seems to be
as much the Fountain of moisture, as the Sun is of heat, as is apparent by the
Tides, which constantly attend her motion; and by all sorts of Shellfish, and
the eyes of Cats, which are all fuller and bigger at the Full-Moon, then they
are at the Change or New Mood: Again, it is very observable, that if a man
chance to fall asleep, abroad in the Fields in a Moonlight night, how she
besots him, and fills him with dullness and drowsiness: but besides those
palpable acts of the Sun and Moon, they have their secret and imperceptible
influence, as the other Planets and Stars; for though heat is the Nurse of
Life, and moisture an handmaid to it, yet it is not the mere heat which gives
life, nor the mere moisture that helps to live; for if so, then might man
make living Creatures artificially, but this we see is past his skill to do;
the heat may hatch the eggs, but all the art of man cannot make an egg that can
be hatched: No, for there is a secret act of Sun and Moon, besides the mere
putting to of heat and moisture, which produces life both in sensitive and
vegetive Animals. And in these secret and insensible operations or influences,
of the Sun, Moon, and Stars; besides the light which they give, consists that
rule, which they do exercise over all the Sons of day and night: so that man if
he lives upon the earth, must come under the touch thereof, so well as Brutes
and Vegetives. And this Power, man being unable to avoid; but must in a great
measure, submit thereunto, the Stars therefore are said to give Laws unto him,
and to the whole Body of Mortallity, so long as the World endures: So then,
Astra regunt homines, sed regit Astra Deus, the Stars rule men, but God rules
the Stars. Ay, but hark ye, (say some) what do you tell us of the heat and
moisture of the Sun and Moon, and their secret influences in producing and
upholding life; it is God that gives life to all Creatures, and maintains the
same in them, and he it is, that rules all persons and things on earth: So say
we too, this we know and believe, only the question is, how he does them?
whether with means or without? if without means, then every Child that is born,
every living creature that is brought forth, and every Seed and Herb that grows
out of the Ground, comes to pass by a new creation, as well as by generation,
for to bring things to pass without means, is all one as to produce them
without matter, it being no more but to say, let there be men, let there be all
other living creatures, and let there be Herbs, Seeds and Flowers; and, as the
word says, they come to pass: but we know there was never above one Creation,
for the Scripture tells us, that on the seventh day God ended his Work, which
he had made, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work, which he had
made, Genesis 2.2. And ever since that, all things have come to pass by nature,
and therefore must there be some kind of natural means for the production
thereof: and now if with means these things come to pass, it is either by
earthly means alone, or by the help of some Super-Terrestrial Powers also
aiding and assisting, that they come to pass: but by earthly means alone it is
plain they cannot come to pass, for it is not either Fire, Air, Earth, or
Water, or all together, that can of themselves produce or maintain life to any
creature, or bestow that goodly sweet savor unto the Rose: there must
therefore be for certain some other Superior Power aiding and assisting, and
this powerful virtue, the Scripture, reason, and experience tells us, is lodged
in the Heavens and Stars; as communicated unto them, by the Almighty Creator.
It Is true indeed, that God is as well able to govern and maintain all things
without means, as he was at first to constitute and create the frame of nature,
but such is his pleasure, that he does work by means; and not immediately in
all things: and therefore though it be the hand of God that does all these
things, yet is not that hand of God put to by any new contrived act, but
follows on course in the motion of nature, even as from the beginning it was
contrived from all Eternity: for the works of God are known unto him, from the
beginning unto the end of the World; which knowledge of God, before the
Creation was no where written, but in his own Eternal Mind; but after, it was
printed in a certain Book, called Nature, wherein, all the works of God, that
were to come to pass in time, were expressly written down, as they were to
follow in order, this Book of Nature, was a certain frame or model of the
World, wherein, what by Creation, and generation, all persons, things, and
actions, were to take their several courses and turns, so as to come to pass in
time, from the beginning unto the ending of the World. And so infinitely and
wonderfully well, was this model of the World contrived; that though the rise
and fall of Persons, Towns, and Countries, do depend upon the Virtues and Vices
of the men there inhabiting; and those Virtues and Vices, do depend upon the
free agency of those men's wills: yet such was the contrivance, that neither the
fall of the first man, and the corruption, and the crush which the world
endures thereupon; nor the infinite sins of after mankind, and the desolations
that do continually follow thereupon, did necessarily require, any correction
or amendment, of that first frame: but such was the infinitely to be admired
and never enough to be adored forecast and providence of God; that at one view,
appearhing unto him, all the several turnings and windings of all men's Wills,
and the total sum and upshot of all Virtue and Vice; he did at once, so
contrive, that all fates of prosperity and adversity, of reward and punishment,
should so fall out and come to pass, as to answer the Virtues and Prayers of
the Righteous, and the Vices and Villainies of the wicked, each according to
their works, in due and fit suiting times: this Field is so large, that if I
should walk much further therein, I should too much exceed the bounds of an
Epistle, to so small a Treatise: I would therefore wish all young Students, and
true lovers of Art, to furnish themselves with that witty, learned, and sober
defense of Astrology, written by that worthy Divine, Mr. John Butler: and now
it follows that I might give you a description of the ensuing Discourse, but it
being so largely described in the Title Page, and the Book of a little Volumn,
it will be altogether needless; only observe thus much in brief, Astrology,
besides an Introduction, or knowledge of its Rudiments, consists of four
distinct Parts, viz. Horary-Questions, Elections, Nativities, and Mundane
Overtures; all which I give my Vote for, though some have magnified one or
other of them, and run down the rest, without any strenuous reason for so
doing, except ignorance; but the last is the subject of our following Tract,
wherein you have in brief, the Precepts of the most approved and authentic
Authors, as to the Substance of the matter: though in words and some
circumstances, a little different. I could have been much more large in every
particular, but I well hope, to see the whole Doctrine hereof, performed by a
more able Pen and Brain, for the benefit of all those ingenious lovers of Art,
that nothing understand the Latin Tongue: besides, what I have done, there is
no question, but will be sufficiently hist and pisht at, by such as can esteem
of nothing, but what was hammered on their own Anvil: for we may observe many
of them taking great pains, to level the reputations of some one or other that
went before them, to make way for the displaying of their supposed Trophies:
Thus friendly Reader, I take my leave of thee, and shall remain thy well wisher.

THE INTRODUCTION.
CHAP. I. Of the Number, Names and Characters of the Planets.
AMongst all those glittering Lamps that the Almighty God has placed in the
Heavens, there be seven wandering Stars, called Planets, viz. Saturn, Jupiter,
Mars, Sol, Venus, Mercury, and Luna; there is also the Dragon's head, Dragon's
tail, and Part of Fortune.

CHAP. II. Of the Number, Names, Characters, and manifold Divisions of the
Signs of the Zodiac.
KNow then that the Heavens are divided into 12 equal Parts, called Signs: viz.
Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittary,
Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces.

Every one of these Signs are divided into 30 equal Parts, or Degrees; every
Degree into 60 Minutes, and every Minute into 60 Seconds, etc.

are fiery Signs, earthy, airy, watery.

Fiery Signs are hot and dry, and so make up the fiery triplicity; earthy, cold
and dry, and make the earthy triplicity; aerie, hot and moist, and so compose
the aerie, triplicity; watery, cold and moist, and these constitute the watery
triplicity.

are Masculine and Diurnal Signs, are Feminine and Nocturnal.

are Northern Signs, because they decline from the Equinoctial Line toward the
North Pole: are Southern Signs, because they decline from the Equinoctial
toward the South Pole.

are Signs commanding, obeying.

are Signs of right or long Ascentions, are Signs of oblique or short
Ascentions.

are moveable Signs.

are fixed Signs.

are common Signs.

are Equinoctial Signs.

are tropicks, or tropical Signs.

are cardinal Signs.

are humane Signs, bestial.

are fruitful Signs, barren.

are double bodied Signs.

are mute Signs, or slow of voice.

are whole Signs, broken.

are fortunate Signs, unfortunate.

are sweet Signs, bitter.

are weak Signs, strong.

Signs opposite to each other in the Heavens, are to, to, to, to, to, to.

Through these 12 Signs the Planets take their progress, and are always to be
found in one part or other of the same.

In the very next place I shall present you with a Table of the Essential
Dignities of the Planets (which by some perhaps may be thought immethodical)
yet I know no reason why they should think so, however we will insert it in a
Chapter by it self.

CHAP. III. Of the Essential Dignities of the Planets.

10 20 30 d 6 12 20 25 30 10 20 30 n 27 8 14 20 26 30 10 20 30

The use of the foregoing Table is thus understood.
In the first Column you have the Twelve Signs, beginning at, then,,, etc. down
to.

In the next Column to Signs, is written Houses of the Planets, under it. d..
n. etc. over against to the left hand is, again; which tells you that is the
day house of, and the night house of, understand the like of all the rest, and
then you will see and know that every Planet (except and) have two of those
Signs for their Houses: as, and;, and;, and;,;, and;, and;,.

In the third Column you have the Exaltations of the Planets, in it and over
against, is 19. under him, over against, you may see 3. So the 19 Degree of is
the very Point of the s Exaltation, the 3 Degree of is the s. etc. yet you must
understand that the Exaltation of a Planet reaches the whole Sign.

In the fourth Column is Triplicities written over head, under which against,
is; under d. and under n. which shows that they rule the fiery Triplicity, the
by day, and by night: So against, you find; against,,; and over right,; which
signifies that rules the watery Triplicity both day and night.

In the next five Columns is contained the terms of the Planets, the first 6
Degrees of is the terms of, from 6 to 14 the terms of, from 14 to 21 the terms
of, from 21 to 26 the terms of, and from 26 to 30 are the terms of. So of the
rest in order.

Every Sign is again divided into three equal Parts, called Faces or Decanates,
so the first 10 Degrees of is the face of, from 10 to 20 the face of, and from
20 to 30 the face of: observe the same in the rest.

Next is the Detriments, as you will find in is in her Detriment, in in his
Detriment, etc.

The last Column tells you the falls of the Planets, so in is in his fall, in
in his fall, etc.

Thus much for the description of the Table, I will now show you the
signification of a Planet in any of his or her Essential Dignities, that I may
make good the word use, to the full: Observe then, that

A Planet in his own house direct, signifies a Person of a strong and healthful
constitution, he is one that will be known in his Family, and rule over them
with good Judgment; likewise he lives in a very plentiful way, or at least in a
thriving condition.

A Planet in his Exaltation, denotes a Person of a high majestical carriage, a
proud lofty disposition, high minded; assuming more than his due, scorns to
^^oop or buckle to any: in matters of war, a Planet in his Exaltation is
stronger than one in his own house.

A Planet in his Triplicity, shows a Person at the present time to be in a
pretty good condition, and modestly well endued with the Goods and Fortunes of
this World; not meanly nor very well descended, yet his present state is
commendable.

A Planet in his term, declares one rather participating of the temper and
shape of the said Planet, than of the Wealth, Power or Dignity by him denoted.

A Planet in his face, and no otherwise dignified, the Person by him denoted is
as it were at the last shift, or as some say at the last gasp, not knowing what
to do, or how to bestow himself: You may judge likewise the deplorable
condition of things, as well as what we have said of a Person.

The signification of a Planet in his Essential Debilities.
A Planet in his Detriment, signifies one cast out of all good Enjoyments, and
that without hope of recovery: a Person that is his own Enemy, and lives in a
dejected condition.

A Planet Peregrine, signifies a Person to be a Stranger, or Sojourner in the
place where he is.

A Planet in his fall, denotes a Person averse to honor, I believe it is
because he has lost it: for I have more than once experienced, that when a
Planet was so posited, the Person by him signified made Shipwreck of his
credit; but it prenotes only a present subjection to a misfortune, which in a
little time may be vanquished: In matters of War, a Planet in his fall is
weaker than one in his detriment.

A Planet is in his detriment when he is in a Sign opposite to his own House,
in his fall when he is in the opposite Sign to his exaltation; and Peregrine
when he is void of all Essential Dignities, viz. neither in his house,
exaltation, triplicity, term, nor face.

By this Table you may perceive the first five Degrees of are Feminine, from 5
to 11 Masculine; from 11 to 17 Feminine, from 17 to 21 Masculine; from 21 to 24
Feminine, and from 24 to 30 Masculine.

In the next Column to the right hand you will find the first 3 Degrees of is
dark, noted by the let d. from 3 to 7 are light; from 7 to 12 void, from 12
to 15 light, from 15 to 20 void, from 20 to 28 light, and from 28 to 30 dark.

Now you must observe another method in the other 3 Columns, as thus; the 5th,
12th, 24th, and 25th Degrees of are deep or pitted Degrees, so likewise the 6,
7, 8, 9 and 10 Degrees, are azemin, lame or deficient; and the 3, 15, and 27
are Degrees increasing Fortune. Understand the same throughout the Table.

CHAP. IV. Of the Aspect of the Planets.
OF these I shall take notice only of the most forceable, which are in number
five, viz. the Conjunction, Sextile, Quartile, Trine, Opposition.

A is when two Planets are in one and the same Degree and Minute of a Sign,
this is the most powerful of all the Aspects, and is good or bad according to
the nature of the Planets conjoined.

A is when two Planets are distant one from each other the sixth part of the
Heavens, which is two Signs, or 60 Degrees, and is an Aspect of imperfect
friendship.

A is when two Planets are distant from each other the fourth part of the
Zodiac, which is three Signs or 90 Degrees, and this Aspect is of imperfect
Enmity.

A is when two Planets are the third part of the Heavens asunder, which is four
Signs or 120 Degrees, and this Aspect is of perfect love and friendship.

And is when two Planets are diametrically opposite to each other, viz. six
Signs or 180 Degrees, this divides the Heavens into two equal parts, and is an
Aspect of perfect evil; for being both in a direct line, and this distance
asunder they openly oppose each other.

The Aspects go under two Denominations, viz. partil and platick. A partil
Aspect is when two Planets be exactly so many Degrees and Minutes from one
another as make a perfect Aspect. A platick admits of the moity of each Planets
Orbs.

The Orbs of the Planets are thus understood, viz. 9 Degrees, 9 Degrees, 8
Degrees, 17 Degrees, 7 Degrees, 7 Degrees, 12 Degrees.

Thus you see the Orbs of is 9 Degrees, the half of which is 4 degr. 30 min.
the Orbs of is 17 Degrees, the half thereof is 8 Degrees 30 Minutes, this being
added together makes 13 Degrees, which tells you that when and are within 13
Degrees of a;,,, or to each other, they are said to be in a platick Aspect: now
if they are applying to the Aspect, the good or evil thereby signified is not
yet come to a perfect birth; but if they be seperating then it is over, I mean
the heat thereof; but it will be visable although in a declining condition,
till they are 13 Degrees separated, and then it will wholly disappear; you must
likewise know, that Aspects are dexter and sinister: therefore view the
following Table.

Sinister Aspects. The 12 Signs Dexter Aspects.

Here you see a Planet in casts his sinister to, his sinister to, and his
sinister to his dexter to, his to, and his dexter to; the cannot be said to
dexter or sinister; however you see it falls in.

CHAP. V. Of the Antiscions, etc.
Cont. Ant. Signs Antiscion Cont. Ant. Signs Antiscion

This Table is easy to understand, for in these three left hand Columns you
may find that a Planet in casts his antiscion to, and contrantiscion to: So
likewise by the three right hand Columns, a Planet in casts his antiscion to
and contrantiscion to, etc. to know the degr. and min. of a Planets Antiscion,
you must substract the degr. and min. he is in from 30 degr. and the remainder
is the degr, and min. of his antiscion, and the same degr, and min. of the
opposite Sign to his antiscion is his contrantiscion.

Example.
Suppose in 10 degr. 37 min. of, his antiscion by those precepts will be found
in 19 degr. 23 min. of, and his contrantiscion in 10 degr. 23 min. of.

An antiscion is in virtue equal to a if the Planet be strong, and equal to a
if he be weak; the counter-antiscion is equivalent to an if the Planet be
strong, but like unto a if he be weak.

CHAP. VI. Of the Division of the Heavens into 12 Equal Parts.
THe whole Globe is first and principally divided into four equal parts by two
great Circles, the Meridian and Horizon; the Horizon divides the Heavens into
two Hemispheres, the North and South, called the upper and lower Hemisphere.

The Meridian cutteth the Heavens into two equal parts also, viz. East and
West; called the oriental and occidental parts thereof.

Every one of these are again divided into three equal parts more, by Circles
of Position, which intersect the Equator, and do likewise meet in the Points of
Section of the grand Meridian with the Horizon.

Thus are the Heavens equally divided into 12 Parts, which the Learned have
called Mansions or Houses.

Oriental Houses are the 3, 2, 1, 12, 11, and 10.

Occidental Houses are the 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, and 4.

The 1st, 10th, 7th and 4th Houses are Angles.

The 11th, 5th, 8th and 2d are succedent Houses.

The 12th, 9th, 6th and 3d are cadent Houses.

Houses opposite to each other are the 1 and 7, 2 and 8, 3 and 9, 4 and 10, 5
and 11, 6 and 12.

The upper Hemisphere contains the 12, 11, 10, 9, 8 and 7th Houses.

The lower Hemisphere have the 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1st Houses.

diagram of sky A Scheme, or Figure of the Heavens.


The Lines that the Figures stand by show the entering or Cusp of each House.

The 1st, 12th and 11th Houses signifies Childhood.

The 10th, 9th and 8th youth, or young people.

Th 7th, 6th and 5th manhood.

The 4th, 3d and 2d old age.

The use that may be made hereof is this, if in a Figure of a Revolution of any
year of the World, Eclipse, great Conjunction, etc. You find the Lord of the
Ascendant in the 11th afflicted by the Lord of the 8th: You may judge there
will be a great Death or Mortallity among Children, or such as are under 15
years of Age; but you must also have respect to the Planet, for signifies old
people;,, and such as are in the prime of their Age, and Youth, in her first
quarter Children, in the second Youth, in the third Manhood, and in her last
quarter those that are well in years.

CHAP. VII. To erect a Figure of the Heavens, for any hour of the day or night,
by a Table of Houses.
IN erecting a Figure, you must be advised in these things.

First, be sure you are furnished with a Table of Houses fitted for the
Latitude of the place you intend to erect your Figure in.

Secondly, Consider the Year, Month, day of the month, day of the Week, the
hour and minute of the day.

Thirdly, You must have by you in a readiness an Ephemeris, or Almanac, that
have the true places of the Planets.

Fourthly, In your Ephemeris for that year, and in the Month, against the day,
find the place of the Sun, in Signs, Degrees, and Minutes, at Noon.

Fifthly, Have recourse to your Table of Houses, and seek the Sun's place,
under the 10th House; then take the hour, minute, and second that stands right
against it, under the title time from noon, and add it to the hour and minute
of the day or night you erect your Figure for; with which Sum enter the Table
of Houses again, (if it exceed not 24 hours, but if it do deduct 24 hours from
it) and with the remainder enter the Table, under time from noon; against it,
in a right Line, you will have the Cusp of the 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, and 3 Houses;
and then upon their opposite Houses place the opposite Signs, Degrees and
Minutes.

This being done, find by the Ephemeris the places of all the Planets at the
day proposed, and set each one of them in his proper place in the Figure. Where
note, if the degr. and min. of the Planets place be more than the Cusp of the
House possessed by the Sign he is in, you must set him over the Cusp in the
House; but if his degr. and min. be less than the Cusp of the House, then place
him before the Cusp thereof in the other House.

You must likewise find the and set it in the Figure.

It is sound thus, substract the Sign, degr. and min. of the s place in your
Figure, from the Sign, degr, and min. of the s place, to the remainer add the
Sign, degr. and min. of the Ascendent, the Sun is the true place of, which you
must reckon from.

Example.
In 1677, March 9th, at 9 hours, 27 minutes Post-Meridian or Afternoon; the Sun
made his ingress into the first scruple of, according to the Rudolphine Tables;
for which time we will set a Scheme by a Table of Houses for the Latitude o^
London, viz. 51, 32.

Now I enter the Table of Houses i^ that Page where it is written Sol in Aries
or in; with the Sun's place 0 Degrees, under Dom. X. or 10th House, and righ^
against it, to the left hand I find 0 hour, 0 minute, 0 second, under time from
noon: which tells me I have nothing of time, to add to the time of the
Revolution; I therefore move along under time from noon, till I come to 9
hours, 27 minutes, which I cannot find, but I can have 9 hours, 25 minutes, 44
seconds, this wants but a little more than a minute thereof, which is near
enough. And so in a strait Line from these Numbers, I have the Cusps of the six
Oriental Houses; the nearest whole Degrees we shall accept in our Figure and
neglect the minutes.

minutes Post-Meridian, 1677. a ad ad. London.


Here you may see the Figure is perfected by placing the opposite Signs and
Degrees on the opposite Houses, likewise by this Example you may learn how to
set the Planets in any Scheme of the Heavens.

When you would erect a Figure by Tables of right and oblique Ascentions, you
must first seek the Sun's place that day in your Ephemerides, and repair
therewith to a Table of right Ascentions, and having found the right Ascension
of the Sun, set it in some place by it self; then consider the time of the day
you would erect your Figure for, and by the last of the two foregoing Tables
turn that time into degrees and minutes of the Equator, the which being added
to the right Ascension of the Sun, the Sum will be the right Ascension of the
10th house; wherewith enter the Table of right Ascentions again, and the Sign
and nearest Degree that answer thereto place on the Cusp of the 10th house: Now
if you make your address to the first of the two aforesaid Tables with the
Latitude of the place you are in, or erect the Figure for; there you will find
the Circle of Position of the 11th and 3d, 12th and 2d houses, agreeing to the
Latitude thereof; which is to be understood, that by Tables of oblique
Ascentions, for those Latitudes you must obtain the Cusps of them 4 houses.

Then to go on with your Work add 30 degrees to the right Ascension of the 10th
house, and so you have the oblique Ascension of the 11th house, which being
sought in its proper Table you will find the Sign and Degree on the Cusp
thereof: Thus by a continual addition of 30 Degrees you may obtain the Cusps of
the six oriental houses, under their several Poles; and for the six occidental
houses them fill up with opposite Signs and Degrees. Note, that for the
Ascendent you must use a Table of oblique Ascentions for the Latitude of the
Place you are in or erect the Figure for.

The afore-going Descriptions of the Planets must be understood as they are by
themselves, for if they be in any Configuration with another Planet, then they
participate of the Description, Nature and Disposition thereof, either good or
evil, according to the strength or weakness of that Planet, and his good or ill
Aspect; by the true Observation hereof, I have for some late years, so exactly
described the quesited Person in the Resolution of Ho^ary Questions, that many
of my Clients have stood amazed to hear me: and in this I never fail, if my

The use of this Table is thus to be understood; suppose a Town, City or
Country were taken, founded or built, under the regency of and he very strong,
then might you judge it would continue under the Government of the Builders or
Takers thereof, from being retaken, wasted or destroyed, 465 years: if was but
meanly strong, 57 years: if he were weak, 43 years, and if very weak, then
thirty years shall be the utmost time thereof; and so of the rest of the
Planets.

This Table is so plain, that it needs no further Discourse, yet least some
should stumble at it, I will illustrate it thus, in the first and left hand
Column you have the seven Planets, in the next to the right hand each Planet's
greatest North Latitude, in the third Column their greatest South Latitude, in
the fourth their Friends, in the fifth their Enemies, and in the last Column
their Joys.

one year, one year, almost a month, viz, she slips through them 13 times in a
year.

The Magnitudes of the Planets, according to that Learned Astronomer Tycho
Brahe.

Earth 6 times. is less than the Earth 19 times. is less than the Earth 42
times.
The bigness or compass of the Globe or Ball of the Earth is 21600 English
miles, from hence you may find how many miles each Planet is about; as for
Example, the Moon which you see is the very least of all the Planets, will be
found by this Rule near 500 miles round every way, which tells you the Heavens
must be of a large Volumn, therefore considering this, together with their
Influences, with the Prophetical King, you may say when we consider the
Heavens, and Stars, which God has made, What is man that he is so mindful of
him, etc.

CHAP. XII. For to find what Planet rules every hour of the Day or Nigh, also
some Terms of Art.
The The Hours of the Day and Night. Week days 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
Sunday Sund. night Monday Mond. night Tuesday Tuesd. night Wednesday Wedn.
night Thursday Thurs. night Friday Frid. night Saturday Saturd. night

The Use of the Table.
In the first Column to the left hand you have the days of the week, and the
night following each day: In the other 12 Columns is contained the 12 hours of
the day or night, and the Planet ruling each hour, observing that the Planet
which governs the day, ever rules the first hour thereof, beginning at
Sunrising; then successively the next in order, as you will find by the Table.

You must know these Planetary hours are greater or lesser, according to the
motion of the Sun, always dividing the day and night each into 12 equal Parts;
allowing the time from Sunrising to Sunsetting to be divided into 12 equal
Parts for the day, and from Sunsetting to Sunrising for the night: So that
those Planetary hours are never of equal length with a common hour which is 60
minutes, unless it be when the Sun is in the Equinoctial, which is about the
tenth of March, and the thirteenth of September every year: By this Rule we
shall find, that from the tenth of March to the thirteenth of September; a
Planetary hour is longer by day than a common hour, and so much shorter than a
common hour by night: but from the thirteenth of September to the tenth of
March, a Planetary hour is shorter than a common hour by day, and so much
longer than a common hour by night.

The length of the day. The length of the Planetary hour by day. The length of
the Planetary hour by night. h. m. h. m. h. m. 6 0 0 30 1 30 7 0 0 35 1 25 8 0

This Table is very easy to understand, and shows you how the Planetary hours
do lengthen and shorten, according to the day and night, as is before declared,
you may make proportion for the odd minutes of the day if you will, but it is
needless if you do but take the nearest whole hour.

Some useful Terms of Art to be had in Memory.
Direction, Retrogradation, Stationary, Application, Separation, Prohibition,
Refrenation, Translation, Collection, Reception, Frustration, Peregrination,
Combustion, Cazimi, under the Sunbeams, void of Course, Besieging, Oriental,
Occidental, Superior, Inferior, Athazer, Almuten and Haiz.

What every one nor any of these are I shall not stand to explain, it being so
copiously handled in most Introductions; only I thought good to muster them
together, that the young Student may know what he ought to be acquainted with.

VOX STELLARUM: OR, THE Voice of the STARS; Being a brief and easy
INTRODUCTION To the Judgment of Annual REVOLUTIONS OF THE WORLD, Eclipses of
the Luminaries, great Conjunctions, Comets, or Blazing Stars, etc.

OF REVOLUTIONS.
CHAP. I.
SECTION I. Teaching how many Schemes ought to be erected for this purpose, and
for what time they are to be set.
I Shall not dispute the various Opinions of Authors about this business, but
wholly adhere to the Judgment and Precepts of Ptolomy, who was Princeps
Astro^ogo^um; which is that we should erect Schemes for the punctual times that
the Sun enters the four Cardinal Signs, viz.,,, and; and from thence deduce a
judgment of that years affairs, that is thus from the Position of Heaven at his
ingress into, we are to judge of the Accidents of the Spring Quarter, which is
from the 10th of March until the 11th of June, at which time he enters; from
whence judgment must be drawn of the Summer Quarter, or until he enters; which
is about the 13th of September, from the Figure whereof we are to judge the
events of Autumn, or the Harvest Quarter: and lastly, by the Position of Heaven
at his ingress into, we may know the state of the Winter Quarter, that is, from
the 11th of December until he enters again.

However, you ought in a general way, to prefer and esteem the Scheme of his
ingress into above all the rest: For the Ancients have affirmed that the Sun
was placed in this very Sign, and in the first punctum thereof at the Creation;
where he began his unwearied course, in the Meridian of Mesopotamia.

Therefore must the Position of Heaven at the time of his return thereunto
every year, be the Principal Pillar on which we are to build our Astrological
Judgment of Mundane Affairs: and this we need not cavil at, if we do but
consider that he is sons vitae, the Fountain of Life; fons lucis, the Fountain
of Light, or anima mundi, the Soul of the World, by which all things, as well
Vegetatives as Sensitives have their subsistence and vivifying nourishment.

Again, experience crams us with belief that this affirmation of the Ancients
is an undeniable truth.

First, we see that when the Sun (...) this Equinoctial Sign the Earth and
(...) grow green, and ^r^ctifie by degrees afterward, the birds warble forth
their sweet and melodious Tunes, and all Creatures rejoice.

Secondly, we find the Actions and Affairs of the World correspond with the
Face of Heaven at this time.

SECTION II. Of the Lord of the Year.
The Lord of the Year is that Planet who is almuten of the Ascendent, at the
Sun's ingress into.

CHAP. II. Of the significations of the Planets when they are Rulers of the
Year.
SECTION I. Of, when strong,
THe People will that year, build New Houses, and alter and repair their Old,
they will be fortunate in all their worldly Employments, and be in good esteem
among their Neighbors, the Earth shall be fruitful, so that the Farmers or
Contrymen will increase in Substance, and the poor Day-labourer have little
cause to complain.

But if he be weak,
Then instead of building and repairing their Houses, they may be forced to
sell or morgage them: There will be much cold weather, People shall be
sorrowful, crossed and vexed in their undertakings, grievous infirmities will
be spread abroad, damage by Storms and Tempests, Hurricanes, Earthquakes,
Ancient People will die, and the Winter pinching cold.

SECTION II. Of, when strong,
Noblemen, Judges, Counselors, and all such Persons signified by him shall be
succesful, and they will do justice too, which as a good thing, besides they
shall be lively, contented, honored and esteemed by the People. Sure they
cannot choose but be contented then: a peaceable, fruitful and pleasant year may
now be expected, all kind of weather in its due season, and the commonallity in
a thriving condition.

But if weak,
Then judge clean contrary, Jovialists will be prodigal and domineering, windy
and moist weather will come oftener than welcome, etc.

SECTION III. Of, when strong,
People shall be fortunate, bold and active, they will overcome their Enemies,
and trample on all their devices, the Weather warm and seasonable.

But if weak,
Then men will be quarrelsome, given to War, Duels and the like; yet the
Fomenters of such, subject to come off with small credit or honor, the Weather
will be untemperate, hot, bloomy, thunder, lightning, unseasonable Rain, a
sickly Summer.

SECTION IV. Of, when strong,
Kings, Princes, and all Noblemen shall increase in Honor and Renown; the
Common People will be of high and elevated spirits, the Weather warm and
reviving, Corn, Beasts and Birds plentiful.

If weak,
People will be subject to palpitations of the Heart, Sore-eyes, and other
Malignant Distempers, many great and honorable Persons suffer some
degradation, the Weather very unseasonable.

SECTION V. Of, when strong,
A successful and advantageous year to Women and Maids, they will be generally
free from infirmities, and other mishaps, married Women shall love and delight
themselves in the company and society of their Husbands, be fruitful, easily
conceive, and be delivered with much facility; the People or Commonallity will
thrive, and be prosperous, delight in all modest recreations, feastings, and
the like, to go spruce and fine in Apparel, many happy Marriages will be
contracted, and a jocund year it will be to most Persons; the Air will be
healthful, pleasant showers falling in season.

But if weak,
Then People will be given to lewd pleasures, and bring to themselves much evil
thereby: you may judge quite contrary to what was said before: viz. Sickly,
Scarcity, unwholesome Dews, Mists, etc. many Miscarriages, Abortive Births, etc.

SECTION VI. Of, when strong,
Merchants, and all Learned Men will have a successful time, Shopkeepers, and
Tradesmen little cause to complain, for is the natural signification of Trade,
Traffic and Merchandising; therefore when he is Lord of the year and strong,
there shall be a brisk employ among most Professions, Arts and Sciences will be
advanced, and each Student strive to excel therein.

But if weak,
Trading will be at a low ebb, Shopkeepers, Tradesmen, and Merchants break;
high Winds shall often annoy Ships at Sea, and do much harm by Land also; many
Ship-wracks, and some suffer by contrary winds.

SECTION VII. Of, when strong,
People shall be healthy, fortunate, just, honest and punctual in all their
dealings, a very calm and tranquil time, a year hedged round with peace and
plenty, wholesome Weather, no want of Rain in its due Season.

But if weak,
The Commonallity will be subject to many cold and dull Diseases, have little
success in their Vocations, deceitful and false in their Dealings, an
unwholesome, destructive season, the Weather raw and cold, with great scarcity
of Rain when the Earth requires it, and Floods of water when there is no need
of any.

SECTION VIII.
If the Lord or Ruler of the year be strong and afflicted, or weak and
assisted, then we must judge a medium between both of what is before declared.

So likewise, we must observe the Sign he is in, whether it be Masculine or
Feminine, humane or bestial, fiery, earthy, airy or watery; East, West, North,
South, etc. and accordingly order our Judgment.

CHAP. III. Showing how to give Judgment on the 12 Celestial Houses in any
Revolution of the years of the World.
First House.
THis House signifies the Lives, state and condition of the Common People,
therefore if you find it free from the presence or evil Aspect of an infortune,
and the Lord thereof, and the free from affliction, they will be in a happy and
prosperous state, no ways molested or grieved: if, or be in the first, or in,,
or to the Lord thereof or, they shall be brisk, healthy, and enjoy much
felicity during that Revolution; but if or be in the first, or in or to the
Lord thereof or, they denote trouble, vexations, infirmities, dangers and
crosses to the People. Note, I do not mean Dragon's Head or Tail in any Aspect
but Conjunction.

Second House.
If you find no evil Planet in this House, nor in or to the Lord thereof or;
then judge it will be a succesful and advantageous year to the Commonality,
more especially if either of those significators are befriended with the
presence or laudable Aspect of a Fortune: but if or be in the second ill
dignified, or in or with the Lord thereof or, they signify poverty, losses,
little trading, and much couzening and cheating in the World; if be in the
second, or in with the the same.

Third House,
If or be found in this house well dignified, or the Lord of the third in
friendly configuration with the Lord of the Horoscope or, or if they be in
reception; Neighbors and Relations will live in Love and Unity, short Journeys
shall be safe, and removals very advantageous: If or be in the third, or the
Lord of the third in or to the Lord of the Ascendent or, then Relations will
jar, Neighbors clash, envy, hate and disturb one another, they shall be full
of feuds, perfidiousness and heart-burnings, etc.

Fourth House.
Hence we judge of the fertility or sterility of the ground, if or any other
Planet be in the fourth house well dignified, the earth will be fruitful and
bring forth good increase, the Countreyman shall have very hopeful crops of
Corn, and most Fruits plentiful; but if or be in this house unfortunate, then
the earth shall be barren, or not bring forth its due increase, Fruits scarce,
and much of the Husbandman's time spent in vain, houses come to ruin and
little profit redound to the owners.

Fifth House.
If you find this house free from the presence or evil Aspect of an infortune,
or or therein you may judge teeming-women will have good success in
childbearing that year, and People enjoy much felicity in their Feasting and
Pastime, if or are herein they signify many miscarriages, abortive births and
hard labors: so likewise many will be addicted to lewd courses, and small good
come of company-keeping, but rather strife, quarrels and duels issue from
thence; if or be in the fifth, judge according unto their strength or weakness.

Sixth House.
If the Lord of the Horoscope or Luna be in the sixth, and the Lord of the
sixth in the Horoscope, it will be a sickly season; if the Lord of the sixth or
any Planet therein be in or with the Lord of the Horoscope or, you may verily
pronounce or conclude a sickly time; if the Lord of the sixth be in the eighth,
in evil Aspect to the Lord of the first or, those Diseases that are likely to
be rampant that Revolution, will prove the sharp Knife of Atropos to many; or
if he be in the fourth it is not a half penny difference, for they will then
drill People as fast into their Graves: but if the Lord of the Ascendant and
Luna be in their essential Dignities, and free from affliction, then there is
no fear of sickness in that Revolution.

Seventh House.
From hence we judge of Wars, Quarrels, Lawsuits, etc.

If the Lord of the Ascendent or be in with the Lord of the seventh, there will
be much suspicion or fear of a War that year, and many Clandestine Actions on
foot tending thereto: but if either the Lord of the Horoscope or are in to the
Lord of the seventh, Open Wars is then very likely to be that Revolution: or in
the seventh, in or with the Lord of the Horoscope or signify much bloodshed
by Wars, Duels, etc. also many tedious Lawsuits: in any Angle excites or stirs
up men's minds to War: any of the Superior Planets, viz. or in or to each other
in the Scheme of a Revolution, prompts the Grandees of Nations to Eminent
Debates or Differences; and from thence come Wars and effusion of blood: but if
none of those Positions or Configurations be found in the Figure, and or
angular, or the Lord of the seventh in or to the Lord of the Ascendent or Luna,
then you may conclude it will be a Year of Peace and Tranquillity.

Eighth House.
The Lord of the eighth in the sixth, and in or with the Lord of the Horoscope
or, denotes a great Mortality, or Death of People by some poisonous or
malignant Distemper, the Lord of the Ascendent or in the eighth, or the Lord of
the eighth in the Ascendent in evil Aspect to each other the same: but if you
find the Lord of the first or free from the Body or ill Rays of the Lord of
the eighth, or any Planet therein, then judge the contrary.

Ninth House.
or in this house, declares much danger, losses and trouble in Sea-voyages,
there will be unusual Ship-wracks, and other mischiefs to Merchants in their
Adventures; signifies loss of Ships by leakage, foundring, bilging, or sinking
in the Sea, he likewise gives danger of being taken by the Turks; denotes
Pirates, blowing up, or burning; signifies robbing, cheating, etc. in the ninth
in or to the Lord of the first or, declares many Ships to suffer by sudden
gusts of wind, or running on Quicksands; but if you find the ninth house free
from the presence of an infortune, or or therein, then there shall be great
profit, safety and delight in Sea-voyages, or long Journeys by Land: you must
in all these Judgments, mind the nature of the Sign each Planet is in.

Tenth House.
If or be herein, or the Lord of the tenth strong and no ways afflicted, then
will the condition of Kings, Princes and the like, be firm and secure from all
mischief; but if or be in this house, or the Lord thereof weak and otherwise
afflicted, then they shall be in jeopardy according to the nature of the Planet
afflicting, the house he is Lord of and posited in: we ought also to consider
the who is the natural significator of such Persons.

Eleventh House.
This house takes notice of the Armies, Exchequers and Assistance of Princes;
therefore if or be placed herein, or the Lord thereof well dignified and in or
with the Lord of the tenth, there will be no want of courage, fullness and
freeness of those: if you find an infortune in the eleventh, or the Lord
thereof weak, or in or to the Lord of the tenth judge the contrary.

Twelfth House.
The Lord of the twelfth well dignified, or a fortune in or with him, or
posited in the twelfth in good Aspect to the Lord of the Ascendent or,
signifies that great Cattle will thrive and be very successful to their Owners:
if an infortune be in this house, or the Lord thereof in evil Aspect to the
Lord of the second, it denotes loss and damage to many by keeping and dealing
in such kind of Goods.

Thus, by these brief Precepts the young and engenious Student may learn how to
judge of any thing necessary to be known, from each House of Heaven in the
Scheme of an Annual Revolution: and as for them that are better learned, or
think themselves so to be, than my self, let them not be offended, for it is
not such I undertake to teach; and further we let the Student know, that he
ought both in his Judgment on this House of great Cattle, or on the sixth house
of small, to consider those Signs that are termed Bestial, and observe what
Beasts are under each of them: as under the rule of are Sheep: Bulls, Oxen,
Cows: Lions, Deer: Horses: Goats, Hoggs, Hares.

CHAP. IV. Teaching how for to judge of the price of any Commodity in each Year.
HEre you are to observe what Planets in the Scheme of an Ingress are strong
and free from affliction, and which of them be weak and afflicted: then judge
the Things, Goods or Commodities under those Planets that are strong, will be
dear or of a high price; and such things as be under the Planet or Planets that
are weak, shall be cheap or of low esteem; likewise observe what Planets are
Oriental, for the things under them will be dear; and the Commodities under
those that are Occidental shall be cheap: Now if you find any Planet strong and
occidental, or weak and oriental, then judge a medium between both.

CHAP. V. Of the alteration of the Air, or change of Weather.
SECTION I.
WE must first know the general or simple signification of each Planet in this
matter, before we come to treat of their particular or compound denotations:
observe then that is the Author of cold and dryness, and signifies cold, dark,
obscure Air; thick, black and condense Clouds: is the Author of heat and
moisture, he denotes warm and gentle winds mixed with rain: is very hot and dry,
and signifies bloomy hot weather, thunder and lightning: is Author of glorious
warm and dry Air: is cold and moist, she gives us gentle Showers and wholesome
Dews: is cold and dry, he is the Author of winds: is very cold and moist, but
varies much the Air according to the Sign she is in, and the Planet in
Configuration with her.

SECTION II. Now then of compound significations.
in or with denotes cold Rain, Hail, Inundations, or Overflowings of Water;
windy or tempestuous Weather, Earthquakes, and sometimes a great Drought.

in or with high Winds, Rain, Hail, Thunder, Lightning, sometimes Frost and
Snow.

in or with, Thunder-Showers, cold Rain, Hail, stormy Weather, Snow or slabby
Sleet, dark Clouds and Foggs.

in or with cold Rain, Snow, hoary Frost or Mists.

in or with cold sharp Winds, dark Clouds, Frost and Snow, tempestuous Weather.

in or with, Rain, Snow, Wind, dark Clouds or Frost.

in or with, Windy, Thunder and Lightning, Rain and Storms, Frost or Snow.

in or with, thunder Showers, high Wind, Lightning, frosty Weather.

in or with, misling Showers, gentle Winds.

in or with, vehement Winds, Rain or Hail, Snow, Thunder and Lightning.

in or with moist Air, sweet dripling Showers, or pleasant Dews.

in or with, Heat, Thunder and Lightning-showers, Frost, Hail or Rain,
sometimes a very dry Air.

in or with, Tempests, sudden violent Rains, Thunder and Lightning, Snow or
Sleet.

in or with, dry Wind, Hail, cold Frost, Thunder and Lightning-showers.

in or with, Wind, Thunder, Rain, Hail, sometimes tempestuous.

in with, Wind, Rain, Thunder-Showers, much wet Weather sometimes.

in with, Wind, serene Air, Frost, sometimes Rain or Hail.

in or with Wind and Rain.

in with, sudden Storms, Hail, Rain or Snow.

in or with, wet Weather, Dews or Mists.

in or with, Wind and Rain, or Hail-storms.

Here you must always remember to observe which Planet is strongest, the Signs
they are in, and the season or time of the Year, for so we are to order our
Judgment.

The opening of the Floodgates of Heaven, called in Latin, Apertio portarum,
is a sure Sign of cold and terrible Rains, and that is when two Planets, whose
Houses, be opposite, are in or to each other: these be and, and, and, and:
where note, if it be a or the Weather by them signified will be violent, if a
or modrate: when they are in fixed Signs, it will continue long: in moveable,
but a short time: when in common Signs, judge a medium between both; it is also
an apertio portarum, when that any Planet separates from another by Body or
Aspect, and next applies to the Planet whose House or Houses, is opposite to
that from whom he separated.

Of Winds appropriated to the seven Planets. First, according to Authors,
(say they) stirs up the East Wind:, the North:, the West: and, the East and
West-winds:, the South: according to the Planet he is in configuration with.

Secondly, according to reason and experience in our days.
rouseth up the North, and North-East-winds: the South, and South-West: and the
East, and South-East: and the West, and North-West Winds: as he is the general
Significator of Winds, so he stirs up all sorts, according to his
configuration, as before noted.

CHAP. VI. Of the general and constant Qualities of the four Quarters of the
Year.
SECTION I. Of the Spring.
THe most glorious and delightful Season of the whole Year, is the Spring,
which takes its beginning when the Sun enters, then making the Days and Nights
equal all over the World, except under the Poles; and he then leaving the
Inhabitants of the Southern Hemisphere, does begin to refresh and revive with
his glorious and cherishing influence all those that inhabit the Northern
Hemisphere: this Quarter is generally hot and moist, signifying Childhood; it
continues all the time that the Sun is passing thorough,,, And the Rulers
hereof are,,, and they Physically denote vigor, delight, and mutability. So
accordingly while the Sun is in, all Vegetables put forth their Leaves and
Blossoms, and Nature is endued with a Spring-like force: while the Sun is in,
the Leaves and Flowers of the Fields expand themselves after a delightful
manner; and Dame Vesta opens her Paradise of Pleasures to all her Children:
while the Sun is in, Nature's Limners are at work, and out of the force of, and
the delights and pleasances of, paint to the World a million of pleasant
Varieties.

SECTION II. Of Summer.
The next glorious Season begins where the Spring ends, at which time the Sun
enters, and he being then mounted his Apogaeon, is removed to his greatest
distance from the Earth, and being in his greatest Declination Northward,
makes longest Days and shortest Nights to all we that inhabit the North side
of the Equator, this Quarter is generally hot and dry, signifying Youth; it
continues all the time the Sun is perambulating the Signs,,; and the Rulers
hereof are,,; the here precedes the in Government, and all the Births of the
foregoing Spring are now swelled to a pleasing Dropsy, and so they remain
during the Sun's continuance in; and then so soon as he enters, he assumes a
particular (so well as a general) power of governing; and by his great heat
reduces all Vegetables from their Anasarchal swelling, to a positive hectic
Fever: thereby ripening Seeds, Flowers, Fruits, etc. which he fails not to put
forwards while he continues in this his Royal Palace. Lastly, brings up the
rear of this Season, and while the is in it being an earthly Sign, he herein
reduces all things from their hectical condition, into a direct Marasmus: and
now all things are ripe for the Sycle, and the honest Countryman goes
whisling with his Cart laden to the Barn.

SECTION III. Of Autumn.
This Season begins when the Sun enters, at which time he once more makes the
Days and Nights equal, it is by Nature cold and dry, signifying Manhood, and
continues all the time that the Sun is running through the Signs,,; and the
Rulers hereof are,,; first bestows her tears upon the Hearse of the deceased
Summer, and hereby generates a Phaenix out of the old ones Ashes: and so while
the Sun continues in, we are made happy with a second Spring; but of no long
continuance: next comes and he while the Sun is in, endeavors to add heat to
the moisture Venus lent, the better to cherish the later Summer: but that too
is soon returned by reason of the absence of the Sun, the Fountain of all heat
and grand Principle of Generation. Lastly, by his Balsamic Beams, while the
Sun is in, endeavors to perfect what the other two could not alone; and so
conserves the mummial virtue of all Plants, Herbs, Fruits, etc. for the good of
humane kind, and for the preservation of the Species of all things; to the end
of this Quarter, which is as far as his Government extends.

SECTION IV. Of the Brumal, or Winter Quarter.
This Season commenceth at the Sun's entrance into, and he being in his
Perigaeon or nearest to the Earth, also in his greatest South-Declination;
makes shortest Days and longest Nights to us that inhabit the North-side of
the Equator: this Quarter is by Nature cold and moist, signifying old age, it
continues all the time that the is transiting the Signs,,; and the Rulers
hereof are and, but has a double power to that of; and hence it is, that all
things, (this Quarter) more especially while the Sun passes through and; look
with a sad and lowering face, and are seen to wear the Image of Death and
Destruction: now Frosts, Snows, Hail, black Clouds, Rain, Isicles, Barrenness,
extremity of cold, and all things that are negative to delight and pleasure,
have their Regency: but by his gentler moisture, while the Sun is in, puts us
in hopes of an approaching Spring. And thus by this orderly government of the
Planets through the several Seasons of the Year, are we put in mind of the
passage of the several parts of our life, hereunto agreeable; viz. how we pass
the Spring of our Infancy and Adolescency; the Summer of our Youth, and
strength; the Autumn of our Manhood, and declining years: And lastly, the
Winter of our Old Age; where stands ready with his Sithe to cut us down: And
how by passing this vale of misery, this natural death, we go onward to the
government of to immortallity, and a blessed life, where we shall behold God
Almighty in glory.

Of Eclipses.
CHAP. I. What an Eclipse is, the cause thereof, what time a Figure should be
erected for judging the effect of it? what things or places it concerns either
good or evil, the time when its effects shall begin? how long continue? Of all
these in order we shall treat.
IN omni revolutione Annorum Mundi, Eclipsin Solis and Lunae non postpones, In
every Revolution of the World, we must be sure to remember the Eclipses of the
Luminaries.

SECTION I.
An Eclipse of either of the Luminaries, is only a privation or obscurity of
their light for a season.

SECTION II.
That of the Sun is occasioned at the or Change of the Moon, by the
interposition of the Moon between the Body of the Sun and the Earth, averting
or turning his Beams from us, whereby he becomes darkened for that time.

That of the Moon is by the Diametrical Interposition of the Earth betwixt the
Sun and the Moon, so depriving her of the light that she receives from the
Sun, and this is always at the or Full-Moon: the Sun ever moves in the
Ecliptick-Line, and therefore were it not so that the Moon at her Conjunction
and Opposition with him, had Latitude, whereby she deviates from the Ecliptic,
sometimes Northward, and at other times Southward, that she cannot exactly
meet with him there, this defect would be every Change and Full.

SECTION III.
The time for which we should erect a Figure concerning this business Guido
Bonatus that Learned Italian Astrologer tells us in these Words, Si autem in
anno fuerit Eclipsis, vide in quo signo sit adventa, and aequabis tunc Planetas
and Domos ad horam mediae Eclipsis: if in any year there be an Eclipse, see in
what Sign it is and reduce the Planets and Houses to the Time of the middle of
the Eclipse.

SECTION IV.
The Places concerned in the effects of an Eclipse, Ptolomy informs us, Muxime
evenient in ea quae eidem Signo Eclipsis assimilatur, and in qua super terram
videtur Eclipsis: the effects will chiefly happen to those Parts subject to the
Sign wherein the Eclipse is, and in those Places where the Eclipse is visible:
Now on what the effects will be manifested, Ptolomy also tells us, ex
Qualitatibus and Figuris, quae proprie sunt Signorum, in quibus est Eclipsis
locus indicatur, and Signorum etiam, in quibus erraticae and non erraticae
consistent Stellae, quae Signo Eclipsis, and Signo Anguli praecedentis Eclipsi
donando disponunt: the meaning of these words run to this purpose, That we may
know from the Qualities and Forms of those Signs wherein the Light is Eclipsed,
and from those Places in which the Planets or other Stars having chief dominion
in the place of the Eclipse, and the Angle preceding the Eclipse shall be
located: the Angle preceding is the Ascendent if the Eclipse be in the
Forenoon, but if it be Afternoon then it is the Mid-heaven or tenth house: from
hence we learn that if an Eclipse be in humane Signs it will manifest its
effects on men, if in a Bestial Sign on Cattle, in the Ascendent on the Common
People, in the second on their Substance, etc. if it be on the ninth house on
Churchmen, in the tenth on Kings, Princes, etc. an Eclipse on the fiery
Triplicity, denotes the motion of Armies, Wars, effusion of Blood, detriment to
Kings, Princes, or Noblemen, Murders, Thefts, Robbers on the highways,
Depopulations, Abortions to Women with Child, malignant Fevers, destruction to
Sheep, Coneys and Horses: strange Apparitions in the Air: in the earthy
Triplicity, scarcity of Corn, and other Fruits, death of Bulls, Oxen, Cows,
Goats and Hogs, Earthquakes, etc. in the airy Triplicity, Hurricanes, stormy
Winds, pestilential Diseases, a scarcity of Food, death of Birds or the Fowls
of the Air: in the watery Triplicity, Wars, rumors of Wars, eruptions or
overflowing of the Sea-banks, Floods of water, death of Vulgar People, damage
to Fish, etc.

SECTION V.
The effects of an Eclipse does without doubt begin to operate from the first
appearance thereof though not much to be descerned, and when the or cuts or
oppose the place thereof they rouse it up to action, but Authors teach us other
Lessons, which I shall not trouble my self with here, nor shall I say any thing
against it.

SECTION VI.
For to know how long the effects of an Eclipse will continue let enquiry be
made of Ptolomy, whom you shall hear speak thus, sciemus quod futura Solaris
Eclipsis tot annis durabit, quot ejus horae aequales fuerint; Lunaris vero
totidem mensibus: the sense of these words is, we must know that in an Eclipse
of the Sun the effects shall continue so many years as he is eclipsed equal
hours, and of the Moon so many months.

CHAP. II. Showing the signification of each of the five Planets, when they are
Lord of an Eclipse, here you must know the and are excluded.
IN the fourth Section of the last Chapter aforegoing you may perceive or
understand, that the Lord of the Eclipse is that Planet which has the most
essential Dignities in the Sign of the Eclipse and Angle preceding.

SECTION I..
When this Planet is Ruler of an Eclipse, he causes Want, Tribulation,
Sadness, Fears, obnoxious Diseases and Death among the People; destruction to
Cattle, mischief to Birds, cold pinching weather, Frost and Snows; in Summer
pestiferous unwholesome Air: Tempests, Shipwracks, scarcity of Fish, eruptions
of the Sea banks, overflowing of Rivers, Inundations, Floods of Rain, Worms
and Caterpillars abound, destroying the Fruits.

SECTION II.,
Signifies an increase or plenty of all useful things, Health, Renown,
Tranquillity and Peace among the People; Grandees are now made illustrious,
inlargeth their Territories or Dominions, and in general success to most
Persons; wholesome Air and quiet Sea.

SECTION III.,
Denotes much Mischief, Wars, Quarrels, Duels, Massacrees, sudden Violence,
Fewds, malignant Diseases, Discords, and Troubles among all sorts of People,
Robbery, Tyranny, Rebellion, Combustions and Uproars; Tumults and Seditions;
hot Air, Thunder and Lightning, little Rain, Rivers lessened, Fountains dry,
Beasts and Vegetables suffer by Drought, a scarcity of the Fruits of the Earth,
Ship-wracks or losses by Pirates at Sea.

SECTION IV.,
Declares prosperity, health and happiness to the People in general, Joy,
Success, Delight and Pleasure, increase of all worldly Fame or Felicity;
temperate Winds, plenty of seasonable growing Showers, the Earth fruitful,
Beasts and Vegetables prosper, a superfluity of Fish and safe navigating.

SECTION V.,
Signifies quick and crafty actions on the Stage of the World, excites men to
much subtility or policy in all their undertakings; but he denotes a scarcity
of the Fruits of the Earth, tempestuous Winds, Ship-wracks, Pirates at Sea,
Thieves or Robbers at Land, Schisms or Heresies in Religion.

Observe the Positions and Configurations of all the Planets with each other in
the Figure of an Eclipse, and what Houses they rule, so odering your Judgment
accordingly.

Observe according to Cardan Aphor. 45. Seg. 5. tells us, Eclipses Luminarium
super C^vitates, Provincias and Regna, magis quam super privatae conditionis
homines, aut etiam super Reges; recipient enim multitudinem: The Eclipses of
the Sun and Moon pour down their Influences upon Cities, Kingdoms and
Provinces, more notable and remarkable, than upon men of mean condition, or yet
upon Kings themselves; for they principally respect the Multitude.

Here I shall conclude this Subject with the 53 Aphorism of Hermes Centiloquim,
fiunt in mundo multa incommoda, quando erit in uno mense utrinsque Luminaris
Eclipsis, and praecipue in his locis quibus est significatio eorum specialis:
Much Troubles shall be in the World, when both the Luminaries shall be eclipsed
in one Month, and chiefly in those places in which their effects shall be
manifested.

Here follows a brief Account of the admirable and strange mutations which
happen in this Elementary World, upon the meeting of either two of the three
Superior Planets, in any of the four Triplicities. Note their Oppositions
produce near the same Accidents as do their Conjunctions: You are likewise to
take notice that either the Conjunction or Opposition of Saturn and Jupiter is
the most powerful, yet none to be praised.

Of great Conjunctions.
We intend only the of and with each other.

Now when as either of these are conjoined in the fiery Triplicity, they denote
high difference between Christian Kings and Princes, their Kingdoms and
Monarchies much afflicted, Commotions, Wars, Seditions, Treasons, alteration of
Laws and Customs, strange Apparitions, prodigious Meteors, Plagues, Scarcity
and Desolation, the death of Great men, etc.

In the earthy Triplicity, barrenness of the Ground, scarcity of the Fruits
thereof, mortality of four-footed Beasts, Earthquakes, eruptions of Banks.

In the aerie Triplicity, pernicious and pestilent Diseases among men,
corrupted Air, uncouth Sights therein, tempestuous Storms, destruction to those
delightful aerie Inhabitants the Birds, Murders, Treasons and unruly Actions,
etc.

Lastly, when in the watery Triplicity, they are the fore runners of Wars,
terrible Slaughters, Depopulations, Fire and Sword, Famine and Pestilence;
over-swellings of the Sea and Rivers, floods of Rain, and cruelty used by the
Turks or Mahometans against Christians.

Of Comets or Blazing-Stars, their natural pretenses.
I shall not here represent unto you the various causes, or at least the
various opinions of Philosophers and Naturalists, concerning the causes of
those amazing Prodigies, nor yet take notice of their several Appellations, but
only observe three things, which is the principal matter of the whole Subject,
viz. first, their appropriations to the seven Planets; Secondly, their
significations from thence deduced; Thirdly and lastly, what they signify by
their appearance in any of the 12 Signs of the Zodiac: the two first I shall
join in one Chapter.

CHAP. I.
A Comet of a pale, leaden, ashy, or dull wan color belongs to, it denotes
terrible frights or fears, among the People, exile or banishment to many,
Famine, Pestilence, lingering Diseases, outrageous Storms and Tempests,
Ship-wracks, Inundations, scarcity of Fish, plenty of little else but Worms or
Caterpillars.

Such as are of a bright and clear color relate to; they signify a fertile
and plentiful year, wholesome gales of wind, seasonable Showers, alterations and
change of Laws, perhaps for the better if Jupiter be then strong, otherwise
much detriment to those Kingdoms and Places under him.

Those that are red or fiery, be Comets of, they denote Wars, Quarrels, Duels,
Bloodshed, Tumults, Seditions, Massacres, Sea Fights, Thundering and Lightning
in the Air, and in men's minds too: nothing delights them now but the clattering
of Arms and russing of Armies; Thieves and Robbers abound, scorching hot
weather, drying up Rivers, Wells and Fountains, intolerable Diseases, Mars
will be rampant in earnest.

The Comets of the Nature of, are of a yellow or gold color, splendid and
glorious to behold: They signify the death of Kings, Princes or Rulers,
alterations of Government, War, Drought, Uproars, many and dangerous
Infirmities.

Such as be of a glittering, illustrious white color belong to; those denote
much evil to Women, great mutations in the World, alterations of Laws, Customs
and Privileges; damage to the Fruits of the Earth, and also to fresh water
Fish.

When any Comet appears of an azure, sky or rain bow color, claims it; these
are the fore runners of strange Catastrophes, Wars, Plague and Famine: Trouble,
Sorrow, Tribulation and Mourning, wise and learned men degraded and lorded over
by Clowns, Learning it self turned out for a wrangler.

Lastly, Those that appear of a pale white, or somewhat spotted therein, are
Comets of the: they denote much mischief to Women and Vulgar People, alteration
of Laws, Customs and Rites, Scarcity, Wars, Troubles, Sickness, Floods of
Water, Ship wrack, and misery to Seamen, damage unto Fish of the Sea.

CHAP. II.

Fountains, scarcity of the Fruits of the Earth.

. Here a Comet does signify Wars, Quarrels, Rebellions, Perils and Dangers
surround the People, scarcity of Corn and Fruits, little water, and that is
corrupted or unwholesome, causing Sickness to those that use it, Teeming-women

. Lastly, a Comet or Blazing-Star in this Sign presages Wars, Slaughters, high
Differences among Relations and Friends, Contentions about Religion, prodigious
Apparitions, tumultuous Bickerings, over-swelling of Rivers, damage to Fish.

Thus have you a brief and true account of the natural significations of those
Beacons, which by the will of the Almighty are hanged over peoples heads, to
allarum them against approaching evils.

Note, that the Effects of these new Stars are chiefly manifested in those
Kingdoms, Countries or Places subject to the Sign in which they appear, and to
those Places where they are seen, likewise we must observe which way they emit
their Rays or Tail, and to what Planet they point.

Some say that their Effects will be chiefly apparent, when the Sun cuts the
place of the Heavens in which they were seen, or when he comes to the Planet
whose nature the Comet is of: this seems to me very probable, and will be
performed in much less than 100 years.

-- Comets or Blazing-Stars
Threaten the World with Famine, Plague and Wars:
To Princes, Death: to Kingdoms many Crosses:
To all Estates, inevitable Losses:
To Heards-men, rot: to Plow-men, hapless Seasons:
To Saylors, Storms: to Cities, civil Treasons.
Some necessary Rules to be well observed in Predictions relating to the
Subject of this Book, or indeed to any part of Astrology.
First, know that generally, and are evil Planets, or Infortunes: and are good
Planets, or Fortunes: and indifferent: the is Rex Planetarum vel Stellarum, the
King or Prince of Planets or Stars: is his Mansion House, his Throne wherein he
is exalted: or as Mr. Gadbury terms it, his Seat in Parliament: hence it will
result, that he rules the Heart, and has also much to do with the Brain of
Kingdoms and Nations, so well as Persons: Therefore I say, his or is the very
worst of all Afflictions, especially in matter of Life or Honor: and his or in
such respects more to be prized than the same Rays or of either or.

Humane Signs, signify men: bestial Signs, Beasts: aerie Signs, Birds of the
Air: watery Signs, Waterfowl and Fish: earthy Signs, the Fruits of the Earth:
the fiery Triplicity rule over the East part of the World, the aerie West, the
watery North, and the earthy South.

Remember the particular Beasts under the five bestial Signs, as under the rule
of are Sheep, Coneys, or Rabbets: Bulls, Oxen, Cows: Deer, Lions and other
furious Beasts: Horses, Mules: Goats, Hogs, Hares.

are masculine Planets, Feminine.

are Diurnal Planets, Nocturnal: Convertable: is Masculine, Feminine.

signifies bold audacious Pirates at Sea, or Robbers at Land, such as fear
nothing, or are of good force.

small sly pilfering Pickaroons, or Privateers at Sea, and close ambush
Robbers at Land.

This is meant when either of those two Planets be Lord of an Eclipse, Ruler of
a Comet, or posited in the ninth or third House of a Revolution, and chiefly if
then in evil Aspect to the Lord of the Horoscope or.

Some Aphorisms of Hermes, pertinent to the Subject of this Book.
1. An Artist cannot make a commixtion of the significations of the Stars,
before he know their Friendships and Enmities, which is threefold: First,
according to their Nature; Secondly, according to their Houses; And Thirdly,
according to their Aspects.

2. is opposite to, he embraces Languages and Discipline, she, Delights and
Pleasures; the like to, he loves Mercy and Justice, the other Impiety and
Cruelty.

3. Make the or one of the Superiors to signify Princes and Great men,
Scribes and Rusticks the inferior Planets, and chiefly the.

4. The signification of a is not lessened by an Aspect, but an Aspect is by a;
as having lesser force.

5. Make and Significators of Kings and Princes, with the Planet or Planets in
the tenth; but their helpers take from the eleventh, and the Assisters of the
Vulgar People from the second House.

dissolves the malice of, and dissolves the malice of.

7. The increasing in Light and Motion, and in with and, is generally good in
all things; but if she be diminishing in light, it is ill; understand the
contrary wholly when she is in with and.

8. passing out of one Sign into another, causes strange Apparitions in the
Heavens.

9. In Summer, when the enters the terms of, heat is caused or increased; in
Winter Drought, and scarcity of Rain and Waters.

10. When Significators of either good or evil shall be Stationary and Angular,
it shall be the more durable; but if cadent or retrograde, more mutable.

11. Planets under the Sunbeams, or within 12 Degrees thereof, are
unfortunate, unless in the same degree with him; but when they are passed 13
degrees from him, they are fortunate.

12. All Rebellions breaking out at the beginning of the year, are not easily
suppressed.

13. Oriental Planets signifying good or evil, perform their work speedily:
Occidental, more slowly.

14. There will happen great Wars, and many difficulties, when in a Revolution
of the World, and shall be in their Exaltations.

15. Planets in fixed Signs show the matter durable, in common Signs doubtful,
in moveable Signs convertible to good or evil.

performs evil slowly, swiftly; therefore is reputed to hurt more than.

Some Aphorisms of Ptolomy.
1. Ate and a Scientia, from thy self and Science; for it is impossible that
the Artist should foresee the particular Idea of things; neither can sense
receive a particular, but a general notion of the sensible matter; wherefore he
ought in these things to use conjecture, for none but such Persons as are
inspired from above can predict particulars.

2. That Person who is naturally propended or inclined to any Science, shall
verily attain to greater perfection therein, than one that by hard pains and
learning shall strive to attain it.

3. A wise man does cooperate with the celestial operations, and does assist
nature, as the Husbandman in the ploughing and preparing his Ground.

4. When the Significator of a Kingdom shall be directed to the Anaretical
Points, the King, or some great Prince in that Kingdom shall die.

5. When and are in, see which of them is most elevated, and judge according to
his nature; do the like in the of other Planets.

6. The is the Fountain of the Vital Vigor, the of the natural: this I judge in
Kingdoms or Nations so well as particular Persons.

7. The significations of an Eclipse, shall be most visible, when the Eclipse
is near an Angle; consider also the Stars in Aspect one with another, and not
the Planets only, but the fixed Stars also, the constellations arising together
with the Signs, and from thence frame your Judgment.

8. Shooting Stars, and other such like Apparitions, show great Scissity in the
Air, and if they be produced from one part only, it shows there shall be great
Winds produced from that Quarter also; but if they are driven into several
Parts, it shows scarcity of Waters, a troubled Air, and incursions of Soldiers.

9. Comets whose distance from the Sun is eleven Signs, if they appear in an
Angle, the King or a Great man in some Kingdom shall die; but if they appear in
a succedent House, the Princes Attendants shall do well, yet shall some Kingdom
change their Governor; but if they appear in a cadent House, Diseases and
sudden Deaths ensue; if they move from the West to the East, a Foreign Enemy
shall invade several Kingdoms; but if the Comet move not, the Enemies shall be
of the same Country, born and bred.

Here follows six remarkable Aphorisms more, to make up the Game.
1. The five grand Afflictions or Unfortunacies of the Planets are these, viz.
when they are Combust, Retrograde, Peregrine, in their detriment or fall.

2. When two Planets are in or in any other Aspect to each other, if they be in
reception, it increases the goodness of a good Aspect, and abateth the malice
of an evil Aspect.

3. Observe still the Antiscions and Conter-Antiscions of the Planets, for they
have their effect so well as the Aspects.

4. The virtue of a Planet is in that House, whose beginning or Cusp he
precedes by no greater space than five degrees.

5. If or be Significators of any good and strong, then it shall take place to
the full.

6. When or are Significators of any evil and strong, they will bring it on
with a vengeance.

Those that would be furnished with variety of Aphorisms, I recommend them to

Patridge.

Ptolomy says, Ex Solis existentia in Ariete Vernalem qualitatem cognoscemus;
by the Sun's entering into Aries, we are to judge and know the event, and
success of the accidents of the Spring. Guido Bonatus, Post quam certificatus
fueris ad unguem de tempore introitus Solis in A ietem, vide quis ex Planetis
sit Dominus anni; when we have exactly calculated and found out the true time
of the Sun his entrance into Aries, then we are to see what Planet is Lord of
the year: in this Figure of Heaven, is Almuten of the Horoscope, and therefore
is Lord of the year: yet we may allow Co-partner with him in regard he is
exalted in the Sign Ascending; two prime Guids, there was no doubt of this
years being well governed; all the Planets under the Earth, and four of them in
to who is posited in a humane Sign, in with Aldebaran a violent fixed Star of
the nature of, signified occult Conspiracies, wicked Plots and Devices,
Treacheries and violent Actions among men; but as Lord of the eighth is in with
Lord of the tenth, and both of evil Aspect to, so would Justice with Death,
repay some of those desperate Agents: signifies Monks, Jesuits, Friars, etc.
and he being in to Lord of the tenth so well as to the in the Ascendent; argued
their hellish design was at Prince and People, to abandon or destroy the
established Government, and to erect their own detestable Principles; and this
they might think themselves sure of, by reason disposes of the, and is in to
the, but he is peregrine and confronted by no less than four Planets, as before
noted, and who is Lord of the tenth and exalted in the Ascendent, is in his
Triplicity and in perfect with potent, ergo, he stands firm, and must go to
wrack, maugre all his malicious contrivances: we read in the fifth Chapter of
Judges and the twentieth Verse, that the Stars in their courses fought against
Sisera, and truly here we may see that the Stars in their courses fought
against the Papists; for which let all true hearted English Protestants give
due praise and glory to God Almighty, who commissioned them so to do, and in
this the Anti-Astrologer, would be much the better employed, than in busying
his Brain, Tongue, or Pen in so amply displaying in Billingsgate Rhetoric, his
Ignorant malice against a worthy and harmless Science. Albumazer a Learned
Arabian Astrologer says, Mars cum fuerit in revolutione anni in quarto Aspectu
Saturni excitat bellum: Mars when in the revolution of any year, is in Quartile
of Saturn he causes Wars: but he being separated one degree from the perfect
Aspect, and in exact with, as also the Application of to the of, argued that
notwithstanding the preparation, noise or popular clamor that might be of
Wars, it would determine in Peace; and this Judgment I delivered to some
Friends who requested the same of me, long before there was any public
suspicion of Wars: but when there was so great preparation thereunto, and
Soldiers sent beyond Sea, the certainty of War was affirmed, Astrology
degraded, and I laughed at by my Friends: nevertheless I told them still that
they laughed before they won, or was like to win, as indeed it proved, to the
great honor of Art: being the Lord of the year and afflicted as before
observed, signified a sickly Season and a long and cold Winter, which was so
apparently true, that I think none can deny it: there are many excellent things
to be extracted from the aforegoing Scheme of this years Affairs, which I shall
omit, and proceed to the consideration of the Coeli Position at the Sun's
Entrance into the Tropic of Cancer, intending to see, if God permit, what may
be observed from thence concerning the Popish Plot.

Sol enters Cancer, June the Eleventh, 1678, at five hours, fifty minutes ante
meridiem, at which time the Face of Heaven is as in the following Figure.

diagram of sky

Ptolomy, Ex Solis existentia in Cancro, qualitas aestivalis deprehenditur: by
the Sun his entrance into Cancer, the quality and nature of the Summer Quarter
is known: is in this Figure nearly in perfect to the place of in the Vernal
Ingress, he is Ruler of the seventh, and eighth Houses, and Lord of the ninth,
so that you see one of them is both naturally and accidentally the Significator
of England's mortal Enemies; and the other the natural and accidental
Significator of the Reverend Clergy, or the true Protestant Religion: this
signified the Popish Agents were and would be very eager to put forward their
hellish Intentions this Quarter, but all the Planets being above the Earth, and
in no Aspect with any, might well signify that either for want of assistance,
or fear of being discovered, by reason of the many eyes now abroad, they could
not accomplish it: however if we consider the in 22 degrees of, the 31 of July,
we have great reason in Art to believe that they then took encouragement, laid
close to their consultations, with much confidence of success: but the Almighty
disposed it other ways, we hope for his glory, and England's future happiness:
in the Figure and are in to each other, yet with mutual reception, which
portended notable disputes about religious and Law privileges, though of no
long continuance, nor to any great purpose or effect, because they are in
moveable Signs, and neither of them essentially dignified: the and are Rulers
of this Quarter, and in regard they were both free from any ill rays of an
infortune, there could be no considerable mischief or damage to the People
during the time thereof, according to secondary causes: for Bonatus says, Si
fortunae aspexerint Ascendens and Dominum anni significant bonum esse corporum
populorum in revolutione ista: if the Fortunes behold the Ascendant and Lord of
the year, they signify good to the People under that revolution: here is in to
the Ascendant and in mutual reception with the who is chief Ruler of the
ingress.

Sol entered Libra, September the twelfth, at nine hours, fifty one minutes
post meridiem, 1678, die, hora.

diagram of sky

Ex Solis existentia in qualitas Autumnalis cognoscitur, says Ptolomy; the
quality of the Autumnal Quarter is known by the Sun his ingress into: Haly
says, quando Dominus Ascendentis and Luna fuerint in revolutione Infortunati
significant malum: when the Lord of the Ascendant, and the Moon be in a
revolution unfortunate, it signifies much mischief and evil: that judicious man
hit the nail plum on the head when he writ those words, for here was mischief
intended to come with a vengeance, had not the Designs of the Papists been
frustrated by a fortunate rupture: their only Patron, is Lord of the seventh,
eighth, ninth and tenth Houses, posited in the twelfth in to, and in to the
Lady of the Horoscope in the sixth: they concluded without doubt all was their
own now, or would be shortly; for you may see was as big with the Plot as he
could tumble, just ready to spawn: Authors tell us, that an in fortune in the
twelfth signifies malicious private Enemies, but say they, if that Planet be
Lord of the seventh, then those Enemies will make themselves public: and are
seperating from their friendly Aspects with, policy and success leaves him in
the mire, and he justly falls into the same trap, that he had so unjustly laid
for others: Guido Bonatus says, Si impedierint mali Dominum anni Judicabis
impedimentum secundum substantiam mali impedientis, Saturnus enim significat
impedimentum ex doloribus longinquis and morte: if the infortunes afflict or
impedite the Lord of the year (or quarter I suppose he means) you shall judge
the quality thereof from the nature of the malevolent Afflictor, who if it be
Saturn, it signifies mischief through long sicknesses and griefs, as also
death: the is Lady of the Quarter, and she posited in the sixth in to, as
before noted, now who is it that will say this was no troublesome nor sickly
time, surely none that are well in their wits, can offer so to do: and seeing
the Planets or Stars of Heaven did not whisper nor gibber in Pedlar's French,
but speak with a loud Voice, and in plain Language: Let those Demi-Champions
who have toyled themselves in erecting their Clubs against Astrology, forbear
for the future, such fruitless Attempts, and try their manhood at other
Exercises more pertinent to their Callings.

Sol in Capricorn, December the eleventh, at nine hours, twenty nine minutes
mane, die, hora, 1778.

diagram of sky

Ex Solis existentia in qualitas Brumalis cognoscitur, says Ptolomy; the
quality of the Winter Quarter is known by the Sun's entrance into Capricorn. I
shall forbear to explain the meaning of this Figure, presuming that I have done
more already than I shall have thanks for my pains, though I had no other
design in so doing than to advance the worth of Art, and the young Students
Knowledge therein: Astrology if truly understood is of great Worth and
Excellency, yet are there many of its Mountain Professors no better friend unto
it, than your Hypocrites are to Religion, who would fain have a name and no
love to it, or at least a slight opinion thereof: the Nativity of the Popish
Plot is very completely handled by that Ingenious Artist, Mr. John Patridge;
therefore let not any Lover of Art think that my intent was to mend what he
has done, in so largely treating thereon: no, my Design was only to show how
lively the Solar Ingresses, did point at the Actions of that years Affairs;
which probably have not so much been taken notice of by other Students: besides
it cannot be unwelcome to any modest Tyro, in regard it not only illustrates
the foregoing Precepts, but also proves the truth of this Doctrine to
admiration: so that here we may clearly see the Wisdom of the Almighty is
great, and greatly to be praised; he is the God of Order, and has made all
things so to be and continue, he makes the Heavens revolve and move, has
ordered the several courses of the Planets, calls all the Stars by their
names, and has made them to differ from each other in glory; let the ignorant
see and believe these his wonderful Works, and be astonished thereat, and
amazed at their own former ignorance, in so rashly condemning what they
understood not; let them now consider that God did not set those glorious
Bodies in the Firmament only for People to gaze at, but for Signs, and for
Seasons, and to rule over the Day and over the Night, Genesis the First.

FINIS.
