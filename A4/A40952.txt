EPITAPH UPON The Honorable and Truly Noble Sir Kenelm Digby KNIGHT Chancellor to
Her MAJESTY THE Queen Mother.
UNder this Tomb the Matchless Digby lies;
Digby the Great, the Valiant, and the Wise:
This Ages Wonder for His Noble Parts,
Skilled in Six Tongues, and Learned in All the Arts.
Born on the Day He Died, Th'Eleventh of June,
And that Day Bravely Fought at Scanderoun.
It Is Rare, that one and the same Day should be
His Day of Birth, of Death, and Victory.
R. F.
