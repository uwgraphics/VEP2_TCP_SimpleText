To the Right Honorable THOMAS Earl of Ossory, One of his Majesty's most
Honorable Privy Council in the Kingdom of Ireland.
My Lord,
ALthough the interval of several years past might easily have blotted out the
memory of any Obligations, yet it is the impression of your Lordships most
obliging civilities conferred upon me, when fortune had blessed me with the
honor of your good company in my Travels in France, that incites me to make
the least recompense (yet the greatest within my power) of their remembrance
and acknowledgement. But what can this add? Since Countries and Cities, that
have been honored with your abode, describe your fame with Characters of all
perfections concurring in a Person of so Noble, Prudent, Valiant, Heroic, and
so Affable a Spirit: Whence I cannot but be confirmed of your Lordships
Candor, that encourages me in this my enterprise of offering to you a piece
of Philosophy, so much below your acceptance; however questioning not but that
your Honors endowments will raise the use of it (if any may be made) to the
greatest height. And now being conscious of my presumption in aspiring to make
choice of so eminent a Personage for a Patron, do humbly beg your Pardon, and
the favor of subscribing my self

Most Noble Sir, Your Honors most humble, and obliged Servant, HARVEY.

TO THE READER.
Reader,
I Was concerned in my mind, what to call you, courteous, or kind; But since
the Scene of this our Orb represents men moving so erratically, and varying in
that extremity from the Ecliptic of a fixed Judgment, certainly I should have
been frustrated in wooing your candor or gentleness; daily converse gives me
the occasion of observing the variable Fates of Authors Works, which although
indicted by accurateness it self, and accomplished with Herculean labors, are
often termed stuff by some; and to others again, the works of a Divinity scarce
seem to surpass them: But to render Lines harmonical to every Ear is one of the
humane Impossibilities; and no small difficulty to a divine Pen. However all
Volumns sail through an Ocean so terrible by Oricanes from Men's Tongues, the
more by reason they are tossed to and fro without the conduct of their Pilot,
yet it is not this Charybdis of a carping Momus, or that Scylla of a livid
Zollus shall prevail to keep these upon the stocks, but rather precipitate them
upon a Voyage, with a venture of their whole lading full of Novelties,
suspending my thoughts in the interim for a return: Not a recompense of vain
glory, nor a reproof relished with contempt, neither being placed in one Scale
of a balance over powers the other containing no more than an empty air; And
should not that be far short of my scope, marked with a single Character of
truth, and advancement of Learning, setting aside any (...).

The faces of most things appearing yet clouded, many but partly unmask; as
many, although of themselves clear, covered under a vail of dark terms and
absurd notions of Philosophers, cannot but spur any sensible Genius to discuss
that muddiness of some, and redeem the light of others, in the performing
whereof I have here engaged my self in these Treatises, taking what advantage
long time, hard study, and laborious experiments would contribute thereunto.
The only Instruments, that I have employed in the sounding of the natures of
beings, are the external senses, assuming nothing, or concluding no inference,
without their advice and undoubted assent, whether in Metaphysics, Theology,
or Natural Philosophy. Those terms or notions, that only give a confuse
testimony of their being to the understanding, escaping the evidence of
external sense, we have declined as rocks, whereon any one might otherwise
easily make shipwreck of his sensible knowledge. Wherefore whatever subject
insisted upon within these narrow Pages, does not crave a necessary, evident,
plain and demonstrable assent, as being only attempted by external sense,
mediately or immediately, my desire is the Reader would apprehend it to be no
part of my Book. But to give you a more particular account of my design, I
shall first discover to you my intention in annexing Natural Theology: My
thoughts fluctuating in a mist, astonished at the multiplicity of all kinds of
bodies moving about me, advised to stear their course to some immovable,
whereupon they might fix themselves, and thence to ponder upon others; here
they certainly concluded one universal immovable, whereon and whereby all
movables are moved; because there can be no moveable, but must necessarily
have its respect to an immovable, they being relations, which are constituted
at the same time. My next assumption following the chorea of the first, and
drawn from the relation interceding between an immovable and moveable,
resolved me, that a Moveable must necessarily be derived from an Immovable;
whence I was soon confirmed of an universal Creator of the whole Universe:
Thence I made a digression into the reason and cause of the creation of all
movables, particularly of my self, and so keeping strait on my Road, behold my
steps, marked and digested in the fourth Book of my Philosophy, which by reason
of their prius ought to have been ranckt in the front, all men naturally
converting their first thoughts thither; but for orders sake have inserted them
elsewhere.

Here I found the camp, whereon Atheism and natural Faith were to encounter
each other; but the former being intrencht within the flesh, to have much the
advantage of the latter standing bare upon so slippery a ground, whence it is,
that the greatest part of the World, yea, of Christendom render themselves up
captives and eternal slaves to the obedience of the devil, in the service of
Atheism, engaged in actions of Abomination, Horror, and Blasphemy.
Notwithstanding since the ruins of those lines of Blessedness and Innocence,
yet discernable in the souls of all men, are possible to be raised up again,
whence they may easily demolish and batter down those strong Bulworks of
Pernicion, it is that part of fortification I have endeavored to delineate,
the knowledge whereof is absolutely necessary for Salvation, and is a Key
wherewith to unlock the Mysteries of eternal happiness, revealed to us by the
holy Scriptures, which being founded upon the greatest and truest reason, must
certainly require a gradual ascent to it from natural Theology, being a
rational discourse inferring Theorems of Salvation from Humane Reason,
subordinate to the highest of the Scriptures. Wherefore all evidence does
direct us to make this our mark or circle, whence we are to run to that blessed
Meta of the other. But how preposterous and rash is it for men to slip over
this part, and to cast themselves without a bottom into the very depth of
divine Theology? Alas their apprehension is immediately drowned in it; their
understanding amazed at those fathomless pits of reason; in what different and
monstrous acceptions do most Divines attach the genuine sense of Scripture,
through ignorance of its precedents, scope, and dependence? And more than this,
each invokes the Holy Ghost for a Witness for to attest those various
Interpretations. But what is this, but their heavy dull imaginations
hallucinating in the appearance of the Scriptures, like several eyes in
apparent objects of the Sky, some framing this, others that likeness of them? I
am not now to be confirmed in my belief, that the worst of Atheism is latent in
many supposed Divines, their sinister ends, cheats, and vile secret passions of
the flesh betraying their hypocrisy. Certainly, were I put to pick (out of any
Profession) some that were to surmount all others in wickedness, I should not
need long time to ponder upon my Verdict. The cause of this perversity I can
state none but presumption in those, who after a twelve-moneths dosing upon
Ursin's Cat. or Ames. Medul. do apprehend they should know the whole drift and
connection of the Fundamentals of Sacred Writings, which to the same appearing
upon a reflection, dishering, and strange in expressions, have soon confounded
their small relicts of natural faith into a detestable Atheism, however
clothed with a dissembled time-holiness under their dark habits for to feed
their covetousness out of their Benefices. Had these but conferred with their
innate Principles of Natural Theology, and arrived to the habit thereof before
they had applied themselves to the top of inspired Learning, beyond all
surmising, the Fundamentals of this latter would have been evidenced to them to
be the alone absolute Wisdom, plain Truth, and most certain infallibility.
Notwithstanding so universal a neglect of this part, yet I question not, but
many may be found so well principled in both, that their undoubted Faith,
expressed in their most Holy Life and Actions, will prove a great happiness to
their Followers and Hearers in such Leaders and Teachers.

Next touching my Scope in the Metaphysics, which was principally the
substitution of such Theorems in them, as might be demonstrated by sense, and
had their sole dependence upon it, in order to a confutation of those absurd
Notions purely Logical, (although sold for real ones,) that Aristotle proposed
in his Metaphysics; in the interpretation and ambiguities whereof Scholars do
usually consume a whole age in vain, reaping no better fruits thence, than that
after seven years study they are enabled to say Formaliter, or Materialiter to
every thing.

But lastly, my chiefest design ever since the seventeenth year of my age, when
I had just finished my course in Physic, and taken my last degree, consisted in
elaborating such demonstrations in Natural Philosophy, as might serve to unfold
the natures of Beings in relation to the Art of Physic, hitherto so uncertain,
blind, and unfounded on Art, that I dare confidently assert, that the cure of
many (if not of most) diseases is rather to be imputed to the strength of
bodies, than the application of vulgar Remedies, as the precipitation of
Patients to their extreme Fate by the ordinary courses of Physic more than to
the cruelty of their distempers, setting aside those frequent mistakes in
discovering them and their causes; All which are so much subordinated to
Natural Philosophy, that whatever rare Invention in Practice, or infallible
distinction of any disease, is deprehended in the Art of Medicine, must be
demonstrated by Principles of Physics. Difficulties of Nature, that formerly
seemed so uneasy to be explained, I find very obvious and evident through
them; Many things that have hitherto lain hidden in the Bosom of Nature, and
such, as no Philosophy could yet discover, you will meet with here. Besides
these you are like to read the quotation of a Book of Souls or Psychelogia,
formerly intending its insertion in the Second Part of Philosophy. But since I
apprehend my self to be much scanted of my time, and that this Volumn would
swell up into too great a mole, I am compelled to omit the publishing of it,
although it has been long since ready for the Press. Before I take my leave of
my Reader, I must not forget to crave your permission of using some kind of
terms in my Books, which although somewhat alienated from their proper
signification, yet can give you a reason of their figurative or tropical
acception, such are Catochization, Grove, besides many others. I must also
acquit my self to you of my default in such plain and unpolisht Lines, which I
have made use of; Certainly, whoever is acquainted with Philosophy will know,
that it is Philosophical so to write; neither, had I been engaged in any other
Subject, could I have gratified your expectation herein, since it was never my
fortune to read two sheets of any English Book in my life, or ever to have had
the view of so much as the Title Leaf of an English Grammar. I have also varied
in the Orthography both of spelling and pointing from the ordinary, and so the
Printer has varied from me; My own part herein I can easily protect, and so I
may the Printers, since his unacquaintedness with the matter and handwriting,
and the dazzling of his eyes, (which a pair of Spectacles might easily have
mended,) in the smalness of my Letters, has set him upon the Lee shore of
accurateness; however you may prevent the danger of some mistakes (although not
of all, since I have not the opportunity of so much as casting a superficial
eye over half this Volumn,) by directing your self to the Errata, which you
will find set down at the end of each Book. In fine, not to detain you longer
in preambles, I shall only commend to you one of Grave Cato's Distichs thus
inverted, Non hos collaudes, nec eos culpaveris ipse,
Hoc faciant stulti, quos gloria vexat inanis.
Condemn thou none, neither give them praise,
Let fools do so, who love peoples gaze.
And advise you to suspend your Verdict upon these Writings, until you have
perused them twice, and then if disrelishing, dishering, false or contradicting
to give your self the trouble of letting me know my errors in the sense of
them, which, since my only scope is to promote Learning, to be taught my self,
and to excite others to the study of things, that are yet imprisoned in
darkness, I shall take for a very friendly office, not valuing the hearing or
acknowledging my mistakes (although attended as usually with some reproof)
provided, that at the same time I may be furnished with better Principles in
lieu of mine, or otherwise I shall think it much below me to take notice of
such Scripts, intended for nothing more than Libels: Moreover, that my further
duty may not prove a regret to me, the answering of such desires in Latin will
obliege me to remain,

Courteous Reader, Your humble Servant.

To Momus.
THou cross-grained Mome, it is time forbear to squint,
If not, I Will coin and cast thee in the Mint;
Bodel be stamp a dog gnorring at a bone,
More stupid, more dull than any dunghitl stone;
If now thou should grow civil, beyond what I can
Hope, then thou art no more a beast, but a true man.

Philosophy in general. The FIRST PART. The first Book.
CHAP. I. Of matters preceding and following the nature of Philosophy.
1. The derivation of Philosophy. 2. What is was first called, and why its name
was changed. 3. The original of Philosophy. The first Inventers of it. 4. What
dispositions are required in a Philosopher. The difficulty in attaining to
Philosophy. The pleasure arising from the possession of it. 5. The esteem and
worth of Philosophy and Philosophers. 6. The use and fruits reaped from
Philosophy, and redounding in General to every one: in Particular, to a Divine,
Civilian, and Physician.


I. PHILOSOPHY is a word of a mixed signification, and thereby sounds Love to
Wisdom, both which being implied in its composition out of (...) or (...) Love,
and (...) Wisdom.

II. This name was politickly framed by Pythagoras, to cover the genuine and
first denomination of (...), and to hide its secrecy and excellence, the fame
of which did attract so numerous a body of Contenders (who being ambitious to
be renowned by the possession of it, before they had scarce made their first
attempt, abusively styled themselves ((...)) Wisemen) that through their
multitude, they overclouded a few others, who might justly have challenged
their title from it.

Since then this new imposed word implied but little Fame or Worth, the greater
part soon deserted it, whose eager pursuit being more after the shadow, than
the thing it self, they freely resigned both to the real deservers thereof.

III. Knowing nothing more certain, than that all, which we do enjoy, redounds
to us by inheritance, we cannot doubt, but that Philosophy was also a Relict of
the Forefathers, successively conveyed to us, who did attribute the original
acquisition of it to the first man Adam: for he in his primitive and incorrupt
state, being adorned with a full and perfect Knowledge of all Beings, it is
probable, that after his Fall, he retained a measure of the same Knowledge;
which, although being different from the former in perfection, yet by his
industry had much promoted it, and so having committed it to the further
accomplishment of his antediluvian Successors, to wit, Seth, Enos, Cainan,
Malaleel, Jared, Enoch, Methusalem and Noe; it did attract such increase and
degree of perfection from their experience that we have no great cause to
admire, whence the profound Learning of the postdiluvian Fathers did arive to
them; who were either sacred, as Abraham, Moses, Solomon, etc. or profane, as
the Magicians among the Persians, the Chaldeans of Babylon, Brachmans in India,
the Priests of Egypt, the Talmudists and Cabbalists among the Jews, the Druids
among the ancient Britains and Gauls, with whom many of the famous Poets,
Homer, Hesiod, as also the seven wise men of Greece were coetaneous; after
which, Pythagoras flourished, who lived much about the time of Nebuchadnezzar,
and spread his Doctrine throughout Italy, whence it was soon propagated through
most parts of the world, and yet is over all the East Indies.

IV. As there was an apt capacity required in these lovers of wisdom to receive
the Discipline of their Masters, so there was also necessary in them an
indefatigable study, to add to the Inventions of their Predecessors, which to
cherish and excite, they proposed the greatest pleasure and contentment of
mind, thence undoubtedly resulting to themselves (according to that trite
Saying, Arduum quod pulchrum, That which is lovely, is hard to be attained
unto) which did abundantly satisfy their labors. This is verified by the
Relation, which the Mathematicians give of Archimedes, who was so much
enamored with his Speculations, that at those times which most did dedicate to
the rest of their minds, and intermission from their Studies, he was most
busied in his thoughts; insomuch, that when for his healths sake, anointing his
body with Oil (which was an ordinary Preservative in those days) he used to
make Geometrical Figures with it upon his Breast, and other parts of his body,
that so he might avoid the depriving of his Soul from one moments happiness,
when he was inevitably forced to consult the safety of his Body. At another
time sitting in a Bath, he observed the water to be much swelled through his
immersion in it, collected thence a way, whereby to find a proportion of Silver
to Gold, when both united in one Mass. This Contemplation did profuse such a
joy in him, that he brake out into these words (Inveni, Inveni,) I have found,
I have found: No less effect will it produce in us, when finding that in our
nebulous state of Ignorance, which we lost in our perfect state of Knowledge,
by falling from our Integrity. This seems incredible, unless attempted by the
serious and diligent application of our minds to it.

V. The Scales, whereby to weigh the worth of a thing, are frequently judged to
be the Subject, wherein it is inherent, or the possessors of it, whose worth
found, is the production of the worth of the thing proposed. The assent of this
does infer Philosophy to be the worthiest and most transcendent of all: For
Kings and Princes, whose worth is not to be paralleled to any but to
themselves, have affected Philosophy, and preferred its worth above the esteem
of all others. David and Solomon the greatest of Kings, extolled the Pleasure
and Contentment flowing from their Contemplations, above them of Glory and
Honor, and other secular Pleasures, which they enjoyed in greater measure,
than any before or since. Ptolomy Philadelphus King of Africa, having weighed
Triumphs, or the Glories following Conquests and Victories (which in their
splendour do overtop all other kinds of Glories, and are reputed among the
greatest of Contentments and Joys) judged them to be more troublesome than
pleasing: For he had observed them to have been attendants in their highest
eminence to his late Predecessors Alexander the Great, and Ptolomy Lagus his
Father, and that their Contentments and Joys (supposed to slow thence) were
subject to a continual Eclipse, through their immoderate aspiring to greater,
and through every Alarm of an Enemy, and through the daily News of their
revolting Subjects (although but lately vanquished) discomposing their Spirits:
Wherefore he composed himself to a peace, and applied his mind to the study of
Philosophy, which did so much cultivate his understanding, and please his
thoughts, that he endeavored to procure the helps of men most Renowned far and
near, by an universal Invitation.

VI. A man naked and unpolisht does more resemble a Brute, than himself: What
Proprieties are there in wild Beasts, but which you may find in West-Indians? I
mean, those which are called (...), or Men-eaters: They slay and devour one
another; the shadow of each of them is a terror to the other; nothing
begets tameness in them, unless it be the presence of a Male with a Female,
which the Instinct of Nature, and not their Reason, Hence Ovid, Ingenuas
didicisse sideliter arts, Emollit mores, nec sinit esse feros
does compel them unto. Nothing different from these should we be, were it not,
that Philosophy did rectify and redintegrate our Understandings: To this we
owe our right Reasoning, Morality, and Knowledge of all Natural and
Supernatural Beings; and without that we are nothing else but Ignorance and
Barbarism.

A Divine will hardly reach to Theologick Virtues, unless he be first endowed
with Morals: Neither is he like to compass the Knowledge of God, unless he
first admireth him in his Creatures, and natural beings.

Civilians (those who really merit that name) grow expert in composing
Differences between others, by regulating Contentions arising between their own
Soul and Body.

A Physician incurreth a suspicion of being a Mountebank, or Astrologick
Impostor, in case he be not more than ordinarily versed in Natural Philosophy,
and questionless will be frustrated in his Cures, unless he be exactly skilful
in knowing the proportion of Animal, Mineral, and Vegetable Natures to the
Nature of man, which is demonstratively treated of in Natural Philosophy. To
this does the great Hippocrates in his Book of Elegance, elegantly exhort his
Auditors: (...). Wherefore we ought to apply Wisdom to the Art of Physic, and
the Art of Physic again to Wisdom: for a Physician, who is a Philosopher, is
like unto God.

CHAP. II. Of the Nature of Philosophy.
1. Whether Philosophy can be defined. 2. Various Definitions of Philosophy.
How Plato did define it. The Definition of Damascen. 3. The Authors Definition
of it. That the Essence of God is as sensibly apprehended as the Essence of his
Creatures. 4. What is employed by Knowledge. 5. The Subjectum circa quod, or
Object of Philosophy. 6. The Subjectum Inhaesionis, or Subject wherein
Philosophy is inherent.


MAny persuade themselves, that Philosophy does not admit a Definition, that
requiring an Unity in the Definitum, or thing Defined, which is not inherent in
the Nature of Philosophy, but rather a Multiplicity; wherefore it can only be
described. To the contrary, all Beings have an Unity: for (Ens and unum
convertuntur) a Being and One are identificated: so that, whatever has no
unity, is no Being: But they granting Philosophy to be a Being, cannot deny it
an Unity: and if it has an unity, it is definible. A Being may be materially
manifold, and yet formally one, and of that nature is Philosophy.

Philosophy is a knowledge of Beings by their Causes, which is the Modus
considerandi, or Ratio formalis of it, to wit, of Philosophy: But this is one.
Beings, as they are the Materia, are many; nevertheless their universal Form in
Philosophy is but one, which is to be known by their Causes.

II. The Definitions of Philosophy are variously propounded by several Authors,
who disagree more in terms and words, than in the thing it self. Others again,
who seeming to define the Essence of a thing, rather describe it by its
Properties and Effects: some of which serving to illustrate its Nature, I shall
not think amiss to produce.

Among these, that of Plato is most cried up. (...). Philosophy is a Meditation
upon death. This Meditation upon death, is that which goes under the notion of
a Platonic Ecstasy, which is nothing else, but a qualification requisite in a
Philosopher, whereby he does withdraw his thoughts from singular and material
things, applying them to universal and immaterial beings: or whereby he
inclines his Reason to his Fancy, and diverteth his Mind from his senses: So
that in this Rapture, a Philosopher has his eyes open, and sees not, and may
be environed with Noise, and hear not.

Another Definition the said Divine Philosopher recommends, approaching somewhat
nearer to its Essence. Philosophy is a likeness to God, in as much as it is
possible for a man to be like to God. God is a Pattern to man in his actions
according to the greatest perfection of virtue, and in speculation or knowledge
of all natural and supernatural Beings, the habitual imitation of which is the
true Philosophy.

Damascen in his Dialect, Chap. 3. states this following Definition, (...),
Philosophy is the Art of Arts, and the Science of Sciences, and the beginning
of all Arts; all which amounts to this: Philosophy is a comprehension of all
Arts and Sciences.

III. Philosophy is the knowledge of all cognoscible Beings. By Knowledge,
understand a Habit of knowing a thing by its Definition or Essence, that is, by
its internal and external Causes; namely, Matter, Form, and Efficient. By
internal Cause, I intend a Principle through which a Being is constituted. Some
beings having only a single internal Cause, as God and Angels are constituted
by their Forms Take form in a large sense, as it does imply an Essence or
entire Being.
without Matter, and for that reason are nominated Immaterial. Others are
constituted through a double internal Principle, and from an efficient Cause;
as all Natural Beings. Some obtain a single internal Principle, and one
efficient Cause; as Angels. God only consists of a single internal Principle,
which is his Form, which is that which he is: Hence God declares himself, I am
who I am. Here may be offered an Objection, That God cannot be known by the
same Ratio Formalis cognoscendi, as Naturals are, since that these are
considered in a distinct manner in their Matter and Form, the existence of
which is incurrent into our Senses: Wherefore the Essences of these we may
perfectly apprehend. On the other side, God is not known to us, unless
indistinctly, and by his Attributes, not by his Essentials. My Answer to this,
is, That our Knowledge of God is no less distinct, evident, and sensible (I
term it sensible, because according to the Dogmatical Institutions of
Aristotle, the Root and Evidence of our Knowledge is, and sloweth from our
Senses) than of Naturals: and to speak truth, we neither understand certainly
the Essence of God, nor of his Creatures, only their Existences, and other
Accidents and Modes, under which the Peripateticks imagine the Essentials of a
Being to be latent: So that only the (...), and not the (...), does appear unto
us. Whence my Inference is, that the Ratio Formalis of knowing immaterial and
material Beings is the same, whereby we know the Essences of both in an equal
manner. We doubt no less of the Being of God, than of the Being of his
Creatures; because as we know these to have a Being and Essence by their
sensible operations and effects (For Omne quod est, est propter operationem;
All which is, or has a being, is or has it for an Operation) so we are also
certain of the being and Essence of God by his Operation and Effects upon our
Senses. We know that a material Substance consists of Matter, because we
apprehend a trinal dimension of parts in it, which is an Accident concomitant
to Matter, or rather Matter it self. We are also sensible of a Form inhering in
that Matter through its Qualities and distinct moving. We gather from
Experience, that (Nihil fit a seipso) no material Essence receives a Being
from it self; but from an Efficient. By which three Causes a Natural Being is
generated, and from them derives its Definition. In like manner do our Senses
declare to us, that God's Nature is immaterial: For we cannot perceive a trinal
dimension of Parts in him, only that he consists of a pute, single and formal
Being, because we cannot but perceive his formal and spiritual Operations, and
Effects upon all material Beings. Wherefore the Knowledge of God proves no
less evident to us, and in the same degree and manner of Perfection, then of
Elementary and Created Substances.

IV. Knowledge in the forementioned Definition does equally imply a Practick
and Theoretick Knowledge, the ground of which Division is founded upon the
Matter and not the Form of Philosophy: so that according to the same sense, the
understanding is called either Practick or Theoretick; not formally, as if the
Understanding were twofold in man, but because it apprehends an object
according to its double Representation of being Practical or Theoretical.

V. Subjectum circa quod, or Object of Philosophy, are all Beings comprehending
real and objective Beings, Essences, and their Modes, which latter are not
specifically distinct from the former; but identificared, and considered here
as real, notwithstanding partaking of a Modal Distinction; wherefore it makes
no Formal Distinction in this universal Knowledge. In the like manner are the
(Phenomenon) appearances in Astronomy supposed and taken for real, and move the
understanding as distinctly, as if they were real Beings, strictly so termed,
otherwise they could not be referred to a Science.

VI. The Subjectum inhaesionis, or Subject wherein Philosophy is inherent, is
the Understanding. The Understanding is either Divine, Angelical, Humane or
Diabolical. In God Philosophy is Archetypick; in Angels and Men Ectypick; in
Devils neither, they apprehending and discerning all things depravately and
erroneously.

CHAP. III. Of Philosophers.
1. What a Philosopher is. Four Properties necessary in a Philosopher, That
nothing is more hateful, and noysom than a man but half Learned. 2. The first
Universities. The Rise and Number of Sects sprung from these Universities. The
Fame of Socrates. 3. What Means Philosophers made use of to procure themselves
a Repute and Fame.


I. A Philosopher, or a Wise man, is a great Artist, and allknowing: He is an
Artist, in that he can direct all his Actions to a good and true end: and
All-knowing, since there is nothing existent, but which he may know definitely.
Wherefore (...) is well derived from (...), clear; because a Philosopher
understands all things clearly, which condition makes up one of the three
Proprieties of a Philosopher, which are, 1. To know all things. 2. To have a
capacity of teaching all which he knows. 3. To teach and divulge his
Knowledge liberally (not for Loan, which is mercenary, and not suiting with the
Dignity of a Philosopher) and freely. Scire tuum nihil est, nisite scire hoc
sciat alter.
Alas thy Knowledge is scarce worth a Pin,
If thou keep secret what thou have within.


Hence slow these trite Sayings, Libere Philosophandum. Amicus Socrates, Amicus
Plato, sed magis Amica Veritas. Non est jurandum in verba Magistri. We are to
deliver Philosophy freely, that is, with a Socratick Liberty, or without
adhering strictly to Authorities of Wise men, since that all men are subject to
Errors, and the contrary of many of their Assertions are found to be true, we
have cause enough to doubt of all, which they have commended to our Studies,
and not to be tied, as if by Oath and Slavery, to believe our Masters words in
every Tittle: an Abuse equal to Popery, enjoining all men, upon danger of their
Souls perdition, not to question the least Syllable of the Dictates of their
Priests. It is no less Error, to reject all which wise men have Published,
their Works testifying their immense Parts and Abilities. So that our securest
course is, to walk in the middle Path, and close with the Body of Philosophers
in this Saying, Socrates is my good Friend, Plato is my good Friend, but the
Truth is my best Friend. To which this does also allude, Plato is ancient, but
the Truth is more ancient. To these three, I will add a fourth; Philosophandum
est, sed paucis. We are to prove our selves Philosophers in short, or in few
words. This was one of the Famous Precepts of Ennius, whereby he reproved those
disturbers of Learning, who through the abundance of their futil Arguments,
aerie words, and tedious Probo tibi's might have raised anger in Socrates
himself, which disposition to nugation and prattling you cannot miss of in a
man, who is but half Learned, who generally has depravate Conceptions of most
things which he meets withal. Such are they, who strive to defend and propagate
most absurd and pseudodox Tenants, many of which do secretly contain Atheism:
As Assertions of the Pre-existence of Souls; Multiplicity of worlds; the Souls
being extraduce, and infinite others, which necessarily are Concomitants of
these beforementioned. In a word, Homine semidocto quid iniquius? what is
there more detestable and hateful, than a man but half Learned? Which Apothegm
may be justly transferred to a Physician, Medico semiperito quid mortalius?
what is more mortal than a Physician but half experienced?

II. The first Schools of Fame, or Universities, where Philosophy was
publicly and orderly teached, were two: The Italian and Ionick Schools. The
Italian or rather the Calabrian School was most renowned for Mathematics, and
Ethics, where Pythagoras was Professor. In the Ionian School Natural
Philosophy and Astronomy were most professed by Anaximander, a Scholar of
Thales. The Italian University increased in fame by breeding of Renowned
Disciples: as Zeno, Democritus, Epicurus, and others. Anaximander's School was
no less advanced by the Succession of Socrates, the Prince of Philosophers, and
as the Oracle of Pythias styles him, (...), Socrates of all men the wisest. And
to give him his due, he was the Ocean of all Humane and Divine Learning, out of
which scattered these four Sects: Of Academicks, Cynicks, Peripateticks, and
Stoics; of whom may justly be pronounced, that whatever Truth they had
retained in their Doctrine, it was derived from Divine Socrates; whatever
Falsehood they taught, was from their own Innovation, and depravate Judgment.
The Academicks, so called from their abode at the Academy or University, next
succeeded the doleful loss of great Socrates, whereby they were exposed to the
Innovations and erroneous Opinions of Plato, an elder Scholar of Socrates.
Plato having finished his Course of Philosophy by an untimely Death, put also a
Period to the Sect, which his Doctrine had raised and fomented, and moved many
to withdraw from the University, giving their minds to wandering, and divulging
their Opinions or Dogmatical Dictates in their Travels: Among which Aristotle
was most taken notice of, whose Scholars, to wit, which he had begot in his
wandering, were thence called Peripateticks, or Wanderers, which name his
Scholars still retained, although most of them received their Learning from him
after his settlement in Lyceum, a School not far distant from Athens, or
according to other, in Athens: The Scholars of greatest Note bred in Lyceum,
were Theophrastus, who succeeded Aristotle, and Pyrrhon, the first Author of
the Scepticks. The Cynicks were so called from their Master Cynosarges; whose
Scholars were Diogenes the Cynick, and Zeno; whose Disciples afterward were
called Stoics; his Doctrine was for the most part Moral. To these may be added
two Sects more, which these late years have produced, to wit, the Paracelsians
and Cartesians. The Bombastin Sect derived their Name from their Master, Phil.
Aur. Theophrast. Paracelsus, Bombast, born at Bohenheim, an obscure place in
Germany, whose Doctrine treated most of Natural Philosophy, innovated by
Principles drawn from the Fire; hence he and his Followers are called
(Philosophi per Ignem) Philosophers through the Fire. 2. The Rotarians, or
Cartesians, a Sect of the latest standing, reaped their Discipline from Ren.
Des Carts, a Frenchman, whose Study was most Mathematical and Physical, or
rather a Mixture of a Pythagorean and Democritean Philosophy.

III. The principal Means which each of these Grandees made use of to procure a
Repute and Fame to themselves, were, Invections against their Masters Dictates,
and fantastical Proposals of their own, dashed over with a multitude of
apparent Reasons, and probable Arguments, wherein they did not only show their
Ingratitude and vain Ambition, but their Dishonesty to the world, by commending
Falsehoods under the shape of apparent Truths, harnessed by their subtle
Fallacies.

CHAP. IV. Of the Distribution of Philosophy in Parts.
1. In what manner Philosophy contains its subjected Parts. 2. How Objects move
the Understanding by their first and immediate Representation. 3. That the
Supreme and Immediate Division of Philosophy is in Practick and Theoretick
Knowledge. 4. An Objection against the Subdivision of Practick and Theoretick
Knowledge. 5. How Knowledge is subdivided. 6. That the Subdivision is adequate
to all its Inferior Parts. 7. Why Practick and Theoretick Philosophy are not
treated of separately, as their Inferior Parts are. 8. That the Common
Quadripartion of Philosophy is too strict.


I. PHilosophy has been defined, and considered as a totum universalissimum,
comprehending all Sciences, and Arts, as a (magis vel potius mexime universale)
more universal, or rather a most universal, contains (minus universalia) less
universals: or also, as in the manner of an (totum Integrale) entire integral
Being, a Country consists of Cities, and Cities of Streets, and Streets of
singular Houses, so is the entire Body of Philosophy constituted by its
contained Parts.

II. The distinct Motion or Habit of an Object sub ratione universali formali,
to the Understanding specifieth the kinds of Knowledges, an Object moves the
Understanding (ut primum movens) through its first Motion in a twofold respect:
1. As it is good 2. As it is pleasant and admirable. As it is good, it excites
a desire and appetite to it in the Intellect: For the understanding conceiving
an Object to be good, in that it judges the Objects Convenience, and
sutableness to it self, and is naturally carried forth to that Object, by which
natural motion wrought first upon the animal Spirits in the Fancy, it moves
the other Spirits lodging in Nerves throughout the Body, by drawing of them to
that Object which it draws it self unto; To which Attraction the other
Spirits are naturally obedient, because they are a continuous Body, or joined
in continuity, and in the strongest coherence unto the first moving Spirits of
the Fancy; but of this more largely in its proper place. This motion of the
Mind upon the Fancy, is called the Will.

As it is pleasant and admirable, it moves the Understanding to its
perserutation and Contemplation, in a double manner. 1. In a less universal,
more concrete, and material manner, in which Representation it constitutes
Physics, or Natural Philosophy. 2. In a more universal, abstracted, and
immaterial manner, which specifieth Metaphysics.

III. Whence we may gather the supreme and immediate division of Knowledge, as
it is most universal, and is Philosophy it self, to be either Practick or
Theoretick, because Practick and Theoretick are the first and immediate Habits
or Respects of Objects, whereby they move the understanding. Practick Knowledge
is, whereby the understanding is determined to Practice. Practice ((...))
denotech the production either of a fluent or permanent work: The production of
a fluent work is called by the general name of Practice: The production of a
permanent work (...), or the making of a work.

Theoretick Knowledge is, whereby the understanding is only moved to
Contemplation, and is not determined to Practice.

IV. Against this partition of Knowledge may be Objected; that Practice is not
the Object of the understanding, but of the will, which by all Peripateticks is
affirmed to be materially distinct from the Understanding: Wherefore Knowledge
being the Object of the understanding, is only speculative, and in no wise
practick. I grant the Premises, but deny the Syllogism, there being a Fallacia
consequentiae hidden in it, or particularly there is more contained in the
Conclusion, then was in the Premises. Wherefore I judge it strange, that they
should really divide the Will from the understanding or Mind, which of its own
nature is formally indivisible: So that the forementioned Objection does not
conclude any thing against my Assertion, since it infers not the will and
understanding to be distinguished formally, but to differ only in matter, from
which our division is prescinded.

V. Practick Knowledge is divided in Logic, Moral Philosophy, and the Art of
Nature, whereby she is helped, and may otherwise be called the Art of Physic
in a large sense: These tripartited Parts being less universal, and less
mediate, are drawn from a triple end or effect of Philosophy, determined by a
triple Object. 1. The Soul. 2. The Body. 3. The Manners. The end of Philosophy
upon the Soul is to help it in its Defect, consisting in its subjection to
Errors, which constitutes Logic. The effect of Philosophy upon the Body is to
relieve its Defects, consisting in nakedness, want of Conveniences, and
subjection to Diseases. To this the Art of Physic prescribes Remedies and
Helps. 3. The Effect of Philosophy upon the Manners (which are actions produced
by Soul and Body joined in unity) is to regulate them in their Extravagancies
and Depravations, which specifieth Moral Philosophy: Note that Logic and Moral
Philosophy are here taken in their largest signification.

Theoretick Knowledge is divided according to the universal formality (I mean
Formality in respect to one another of the subdivided Members, and not to
Philosophy it self, to which these are only material Subdivisions) of the
speculative Object; which is threefold. 1. A Material Object inherent in
material Essences, which limits it to Natural Philosophy. 2. An Immaterial
Object depending from immaterial Beings, which determines it to Pneumatology.
3. An Object communicable to both, or abstracted from each, which is a Being in
general as it is communicable to material and immaterial Objects, which
constitutes the Subject of Metaphysics.

VI. All inferior and less universal Knowledges must be comprehended in some
one of the divided Members of Philosophy, otherwise it would be an erroneous
Distribution: wherefore some of the Liberal Arts, as Arithmetic, Grammar,
Rhetoric, are reduced to the Art of Logic, as it is taken in a large sense,
implying a Habit of guiding Reason being defective in its Judgment, and in
Elocution or Utterance. The Arts of Music, Geometry, Astrology are
comprehended in the Art of Nature, as also the Art of Physic, strictly so
called, and the servile Arts, as the Art of Husbandry, of Weaving, of Warring,
etc. Likewise are Oeconomicks and Politics referred to Moral Philosophy;
Astronomy to Natural Philosophy.

VII. The most universal parts of Philosophy, namely Theoretick and Practick,
are treated of inclusively, as far as their Inferior Parts do contain them: So
that thereby Authors save the labor of discoursing of them separately, and of
repeating the same Matters in vain. Nevertheless was that Partition necessary,
because through it Philosophy is contracted to its less universal Parts.

VIII. The common quadripartited distribution of Philosophy is too strict, the
subjected Members exceeding its extention; for example, to what part of
Philosophy will you reduce the Art of Medicine? possibly you may refer it to
Natural Philosophy, which may not be, because the one is practick, and the
other speculative. The like Question may be demanded concerning all the Servile
and Liberal Arts: Wherefore it was requisite to add the Art of Nature to the
practick Knowledges. Pneumatology has been abusively treated of in
Metaphysics, because its Object, namely, Spirits, is more contracted, then a
Being in general; If you answer, that it is a part dividing a Being in general,
and therefore it ought to be reduced to its whole; then by virtue of that
Argument, Natural Philosophy ought to be referred to the same Science, because
that is the other opposite dividing part; for a Being in Metaphysics is
treated of, as it is abstracted from a Material and Immaterial Substance.

CHAP. V.
1. What Method is requisite in the Ordering of the particular Treatises of the
several Parts of Philosophy. 2. What Order is observed in the Placing of the
General Parts of Philosophy.


I. THe Method requisite in the Ordering of the particular Treatises of the
several Parts of Philosophy is not indifferent, most preferring a Synthetick in
Theoretick, and an Analytick Method in Practick Knowledges, all excluding an
Arbitrary Method in matters necessary, and such are Philosophic

II. The Order observed in the placing of the General Parts of Philosophy, is
drawn from their Dignity, or primality of Existence. If from their Dignity,
Pneumatology is the first, because of its most excellent Object. The next
Metaphysics, because of its most general Object. Moral Philosophy is the
first, in respect of time, because our Will is the first Faculty we exercise
next after our Production, whose first act is, to incline a Child to suck,
which being subject to be immoderate in it, is learned by use and direction of
its Nurse, to be better regulated in its appetite, and to know the Rule of
Temperance; Hence it is an universal saying, Disciplinae fuerunt prius in usu
quam in art, Disciplines were in use before they were in art. The Will being
the first, which required the help of Prudence, and Moral Philosophy, was the
only cause which moved Socrates to teach Morals first, and not because the
Science of Physics were, or seemed to be obscure, and hard to be known: for
even in them he was more skilful and learned than any ever was among the
Heathens. The first in Nature and respect to Knowledge, is Metaphysics,
comprehending all the others in it self. The first quoad nos, is Logic, which
does dispose our understanding for the Discipline of the other parts.

Each of these Parts obtain a distinct consideration. Metaphysics are
considered as abstracted, and Immaterial, that is, most remote from Singulars;
not properly immaterial, as a Spirit, but as inherent in its less universals,
and by contraction may be material. Physics are considered as a less
universal, and nearest to Singulars, which by their common habit and
Representation, exhibit a common unity, which constitutes a less universal;
wherefore whatever cannot be proved by experience, that is, by our Senses, to
be existent in Singulars, makes an Opinion, or Error in the universals: So
that the proof of Pneumatology, as well as of Natural Philosophy, depends from
our Senses, and experience in Singulars. Wherefore every Philosopher ought to
make probation of all Assertions, in whatever part of Philosophy it be, by
Arguments drawn either mediately or immediately from Singulars, and especially
in Natural Philosophy; which way of Arguing produces a Certainty and Evidence
or Demonstration.

Metaphysics. The Second Book:
CHAP. I. Of the Nature of Metaphysics.
1. Of the Etymology and Synonima's of Metaphysics. 2. The Authors Definition
of Metaphysics. That a Being is univocal to an objective and a real Being. 3.
The true formal and adequate Object of Metaphysics. 4. Wherein Metaphysics
differs from Philosophy.


IT will be needless to propound any thing further concerning the antiquity,
worth, and pleasure of the study of Metaphysics, since you may justly apply
the general fruits and ends of Philosophy to it in particular, wherefore I
proceed to what is more requisite.

I. Metaphysics was so called from its Etymology out of (...) above, and
(...), Physics, which in composition imply as much as a knowledge above
Physics, and from its transcendence it appropriates to it self the most
transcendent name of the whole, namely, Wisdom, or a universal Knowledge, which
it retains, although improperly; because it is next compared in universality to
Philosophy. It is called also the first Philosophy, from its nearest
approximation to Philosophy, its most proper Denomination is Ontology, or a
Discourse of a Being.

Metaphysics is a Knowledge of a most universal Being. Knowledge imports the
unfolding of a thing by its Causes, Effects, Proprieties and Affections. By a
most universal Being understand, a Being abstracted from more universal, and
mediately from less universal, material and immaterial Beings, prescinded from
real (strictly so termed) and objective Beings, or from real and modal Beings,
to all which a Being in general is a Genus univocum: For were they not univocal
Parts of a Being in general, they could not be treated of (per se) in this
Science, but per accidens, which is erroneous. But suppose I granted that modal
or objective Beings had their places here per accidens, to what Science are
they then referred per se? For as they are cognoscible, they come under the
Notion of Philosophy, and have a distinct Unity and Essence, which must be
considered per se in some part or other of Philosophy.

Since then they cannot be reduced per se to any Form else, their proper place
must be here. I prove that a Being in general, as it is the Subject of
Metaphysics, is a Genus univocum to an (ens rationis) Objective Being, and a
(Ens Reale) real Being. All Beings are capable of being the Subject of
Philosophy, so far as they are cognoscible only; not as they are real Essences,
but as they really move the understanding to their knowledge: This is evident
hence, (Quicquid recipitur, recipitur per modum recipientis,) because knowledge
in the understanding arises from the knowledge in the senses; and the senses
know objects by their distinct moving of the sensories; the understanding by
being moved by the sensories; wherefore the understanding, which is the Subject
of Philosophy, knows no things further, than it is moved by the internal and
external senses.

A Genus univocum is, which is equally constituted by its Species; that is, at
the same time, and in an equal manner. Univocal Species are, which constitute a
Genus equally. This premised, I frame my Argument thus;

An objective Being, and a real Being do equally constitute an universal
cognoscible Being. Ergo, they are univocal Parts. I confirm the Antecedent. An
Objective Being does as By really understand effectively and properly.
really move the understanding, as a Real Being: Ergo, they are equally
cognoscible Beings: So that an Objective Being is neither more or less a
cognoscible being, than a Real being, and as to the understanding, they are
formally one, differing only materially. If two different Essences were reduced
to one Science, to wit, one per se, the other per accidens, they would
constitute a formal difference in a Science, and cause a duplicity in it, which
should be but one.

III. The Object of this Science is a Being, as it has a cognoscible Essence;
so that whatever has no cognoscible being, is excluded without its
denomination: Wherefore a non ens reale (excusing the Impropriety of speech) or
that, which has no real being or existence, may be cognoscible, provided it
has but an objective being. So a possible being, which is a non ens reale may
be concelved to be an ens rationis.
But for a (non ens objectivum) a being, that has no objective existence, that
has no being, and is impossible, neither can it any wise be positively
considered.

IV. A Being here is conceived, as it is a most universal being, and abstracted
from its more and less universals; herein it differs from Philosophy, the
formal Object of which is taken for a being as it is a most more and less
universal being, prescinded from Practical and Theoretick beings, and treating
of them in their most, more, and less universalities: whereas a being in
Metaphysics, is also a most universal being, abstracted from more and less
universals, but treating of it only, as it is most universal.

CHAP. II. Of Precision.
1. What Precision is. 2. That a real Precision is not properly a Precision. 3.
That Precision constitutes a Positive and Negative. 4. The Difference of
Precision. That all Precisions are formal.


I. PRecision is an operation of the mind, whereby in distinguishing the Parts
of a being from one another, we do apprehend them, which really cannot exist
asunder, as existing separately in our minds, in such a manner, as if they were
really existent out of our understandings: For example, a singular Blackness in
an Ethiopian, although it cannor exist really out of that Ethiopian, yet we
may conceive that blackness by it self in our minds, and the Ethiopian by
himself, as if they were really and separately existent.

II. Hence it follows, that properly there is no real Precision or
Abstraction, as Authors generally have imagined; for that which was really
distinct from another, is so (according to their Doctrine) without the
operation of the understanding, and therefore it is no precision; because a
precision is an operation of the mind. Where observe, that this precision
superaddeth nothing to the (Ratio formalis intelligendi) to the understanding,
but to the thing understood, or matter intelligible. Wherefore objective and
modal beings are made equal objects to real beings by the forementioned
precision, and move the understanding as properly as real beings.

III. A Precision constitutes a Positive and a Negative: A positive unity, and
a negative distinction. That same unity is not a non ens: wherefore the
Negative, which is concomitant to all precisions, is not understood by us, only
we judge by experience, that one being has but one unity, and spying a being,
we judge, that that being has unity, and therefore is not a non ens. The
difference arising between two real beings or essences is simpliciter called a
distinction: the difference between a real being, and its Mode, or Habit, or
Representation, is a formal precision: So that all precisions are formal. I
call it formal, because we give it a distinct Definition, which is the Form of
a being: as in an Ethiopian, we precind his blackness from his Humanity, and
define it a color, which does concentrate our sight; his Humanity to be a
rational living substance. Which beings are formally distinct from one another,
because they have distinct Definitions.

IV. A Formal precision is either really modal or objectively modal. A real
modal precision is whereby an accident is precinded from a real Essence. An
objective modal precision is, whereby an accident is abstracted from an
objective being; an objective being is that, which does not exist really, but
in the mind only, although it is grounded upon a real being.

That, which is called a formal precision of beings in the understanding, is
termed a real distinction in real beings, which are not distinguished from one
another without the operation of the understanding, for it is our understanding
persuades us that they are distinguished really from one another.

CHAP. III. The Manner of Precision.
1. How a more universal Being is precinded from its less universal Beings. 2.
How an universal Being is equally abstracted from an (ens Rationis) Objective
Being, and (ens reale) a real Being. 3. How a common Concept is precinded from
a Substance and Accident.


A Being in its greater universality is precinded from beings in their less
universality; when we conceive a common representation to two or more less
universalities, and apprehend them united in that commonness, and distinct from
each less universal, from which it was abstracted; for example, an immaterial
and material Being have each an Essence: in that, they have each an essence,
they are like to another, and constitute a commonness, this commonness
abstracted from each, and distinguished from their materiality and immateriality
is the formal precision of a being in its greater universality.

The same Rule is also held in abstracting a common Concept from an (ens
rationis) objective being, and a real being; each of them having a commonness
in their essence, which is, in that they move the understanding, although one
existeth really without the understanding, the other only in the active
understanding: the abstracting of this commonness from the objectiveness, and
reality constitutes a precinded unity of an ens rationis, and an ens reale.

In the like manner is a common concept precinded from an accident and
substance, each of these having a commonness of moving the understanding, which
abstracted from their realities, precindes a more universal unity from each.
Note that the Doctrine of precision does not properly belong to this place,
which notwithstanding I thought good to insert, for to explain the
specification of the Subject of Metaphysics; namely, how a being in its
greater universality is abstracted from its lesser universalities: how it is
univocal to an objective and real being; to a substantial and accidental being;
to a material and immaterial Essence; and summarly, how that a being precinded
in the forementioned manners, and univocal to every one of them beings, is
specified to the Subject of this Science.

CHAP. IV. Of the Definition of a Being.
1. What the proper name of the Nature of a Being is. The improbation of
several Definitions of a Being. 2. Objections against the common Definition of
a Being received by most late Philosophers. 3. That there is no common Concept
to a possible real Being, and an actual real Being. 4. That there is an
univocal Concept to all immaterial and material, Objective and Real,
Substantial and Accidental Beings. 5. The Authors Definition of a Being. That
our Knowledge is comparatively as perfect as Adams was.


THe Quiddity of a Being in general goes more by the name of the Concept of a
Being, that is, as it is a conceived being, or as it is an Object of our
Knowledge, than the Nature and Formality of a being; and that justly and
properly, because a being is a being (as to us) only from being conceived by
us, that is, from its cognoscibility. As the common name imposed upon the
Quiddity of a Being is very proper, no less improper are the common Definitions
of it, as they are rendered by most Aristotelian Commentators: Whereof some
proposed this Definition: A Being is that, which is not nothing; or (according
to others) which is no Chimaera. The first is not so much as a Description,
which is cognoscible, but nothing is not cognoscible per se, but per aliud, to
wit, by a being; if so, then a being is apprehended by a no-Being, and a
no-being by a being, which runs in a blind circle, like a Horse goes round in a
Mill. The latter Definition is a Description of a Real Being, and is not freed
from all Objections: 1. It is described by a Negative. 2. All that, which is no
Chimaera, is not a real being: for a Hircocerous is no Chimaera. But possibly
by Chimaera is meant an ens rationis, in a larger sense; which although
granted, yet there are beings, which are neither strictly an objective being,
neither in the same extent a real being; such are all modal beings, which are
distinguished from a real being, as parts from their whole.

II. This Definition is more generally received by most latter Philosophers. A
Being is, which has an aptitude to exist; or to which existence is possible.
This Definition is also involved in scruples and repugnances: for here a
possible being is only described, and not an actual being; wherefore it is not
a general Definition of a being. Others, to clear that Objection, proposed the
same Definition with a Tail to it. A Being is, which has an aptitude to
exist, or is that, which does exist. This is a plain division of a being
existent, and possible to exist; Where halts the Definition then? 2. Essence is
nearer to a being than Existence; wherefore illegally defined. 3. That which
has an aptitude to exist, is no real being, because it has no real Essence,
not cognoscibility from without. 4. It is too strict: for it does not
comprehend an objective being; wherefore we have occasion enough to doubt of
the whole dispute of Smiglecius De ente rationis, since that he proceeds upon a
Definition falsely supposed, and defined by existence, which is only a mode of a
Being.

III. There is no common concept to a possible real being, and an actual real
being; because the one is a Negative, the other a Positive, which being
contrary, cannot constitute an unity, which is an effect of similitude, or
commonness of Concept. A possible being is a Negative; because it is that,
which is no real being in a strict sense: For real in a large sense, is taken,
for whatever does move the Understanding. Neither can I apprehend, how a
possible being may be called real, according to the ordinary acception; which
imports real to be that which does exist without the understanding; wherefore
that which does not exist, but only can exist, is not real. And this is past
mending, notwithstanding the enlarging of it thus. Real is that, which is, or
can exist without the Understanding. To define two formal Natures in one
Definition, is absurd. For that which is, is one Formality, that which is not,
but supposed to be in the Divine Idea, is another Formality. That these two are
Contraries, is evident: because that, which is, we may perceive by our senses,
that, which is not, but can be, or is in the Divine Idea, we can neither
perceive by our senses, or understanding. Lastly, Possibility relates to
Existence, and therefore (if granted) it would be but an accidental Definition,
or rather a Division.

IV. That there is a common and univocal Concept of God, and his cteatures, of
accidents and substances, of objective and real being (ex part Actus) in the
understanding, is sufficiently proved, by supposing certainly, that God is as
sensibly known by us, as his Creatures are, and consequently the Concept in the
understanding may be univocal; that Accidents and Substances differ modally:
And, that an Objective Being is as much a being to us, as a real being; all
which has been demonstratively proved in the precedent Chapters. Besides, the
manner of Precision, which is the ground of an univocal Concept, I have so
plainly and briefly set down in the two Chapters of Precision, that you have
thence an easy entrance, to go through all the difficulries of Metaphysics
(which arise from an omission of an exact Explication of Precision) and to
understand with more ease the subtilities of Suares, Arriaga and Oviedo, than
they can understand themselves, and dissolve all Objections against the
univocal Concept of the forementioned beings.

V. A Being is that, which has an Essence; not that which can have an Essence;
for it has none. To have an Essence, is to be existent; to be existent, is to
have an Essence, which Reciprocation is not the same, that happens to
Synonima's, but to a Formality, and its propriety; so that existence is not
really distinct from Essence, but only modally. An Essence is that, whereby a
being is cognoscible to be that, which it is. Where observe, that as to us,
cognoscibility is necessary and formal to a being; for a being, as to us, is no
being, unless it be cognoscible. Notwithstanding this relative Essence, we do
grant an absolute or fundamental Nature, whereon this relative Essence of a
being is grounded.

That which man never perceived by his senses, or like to any thing, which has
been perceived by him, is no being, neither objective or real. This I prove;
whatever we can say is real, can be perceived by cur senses (or otherwise, how
could we say it were real; for saying proceeds from our Knowledge, and our
Knowledge from our Senses) and whatever is perceived by our senses, is real,
that is, is existent from without. Ergo, There is no real thing, but it is
perceptible by our Senses, mediately or immediately, and consequently as to us,
is real from its cognoscibility. You may object, that there are many Beings
existent, which an individual man cannot perceive: Ergo, by that they should
not be real. I answer, That Man is taken here in the universal, for the
plurality of men, and therefore I added, by our Senses; so that whatever man in
general is not capable of knowing, it is a non ens; for otherwise, if any thing
should be said to be real, and no man could perceive it, or did ever perceive
it, we should say a most palpable untruth, which another would reply unto, that
it was no being: because no man ever saw any such thing, or did ever hear of
it. 2. According to the Supposition of the Objector, the material beings, which
we may imagine to be existent without the tenth or eleventh Orb, are real;
which all confess to be imaginary, and therefore not real. It is certain, that
whatever is cognoscible to man, is a being; but whether a being may not be
something beyond what is cognoscible, is a doubt. 2. The Subjectum in quo of
cognoscibility (viz. Man) is differing from himself now to what he was before
his Fall, and therefore he apprehending a being then further and beyond what
man does apprehend it now, seems to alter the formality of a being, which
should be inalterable: Yea, let us go on and question, whether Angels do not
know a thing beyond what may be perceptible to man? If they do, then beyond all
Opinion, Cognoscibility in man is not the Formality of a being. To Answer to
all these, we must state, that a being is that, for which it is known to be:
For it is impossible to imagine, that a being should be any thing else, as to a
Rational Creature, but what it may be apprehended by him to be; supposing a man
to know certainly what a Color, Smell or any thing else is in it self, that
thing, as to, or in that man, can be nothing but what he knows it to be: or
asking a man, what such a thing is, he will answer you, it is such a thing,
that is, he apprehends it so to be. Again, Suppose an Angel told you, such a
thing is such; this is no otherwise, than that he knows it to be such or such.
I might almost state the same Case of God, but fearing I should offend, I
rather omit it. Supposing then that that, which is cognoscible to man, is a
being, I do affirm, that an infinite being, as far as it is cognoscible to man,
is a Being, and is perceived by him to be a Being; but since that being is not
terminated in man's Knowledge, he cannot out of consequence but think and
believe, that that being is indeterminate, or at least is more than he knows or
is capable of knowing, so that this is a very palpable ground to man, to induce
him to believe (for know it he cannot, since it is beyond his Knowledge, and
therefore must believe it, which is an assent beyond Knowledge) that God is a
being, because he knows him to be a being, and that he is infinite, or
indeterminate, because he is not terminated within his Knowledge, and because
God declares the same of himself; wherefore it is well said, that we know God
partly only, and as through a Glass. Herein is an infinite being distinguished,
and we know it to be distinguished from a non ens, which is also (although
improperly) termed Infinite, because we know a part of the former, but no part
of the latter, and therefore we conclude the one to be something beyond what we
know it to be, and the other to be nothing beyond what we know it not to be.
Finite things, as far as they are cognoscible, are nothing beyond what they are
cognoscible, and although one man may err in his Knowledge, yet the
universality of men, it is probable, do not, especially in immediately sensible
Objects. In relation to the second doubt and Objection, I affirm, that man in
his present state, cannot discern the Essence and Modes of a being so clearly
at once, so swiftly, so certainly, and so easily as man did before his Fall,
because of the depravate and contrary Habit, since befallen to man;
nevertheless his Principle of Knowledge is the same, and may through it
perceive, and know the same things, and in the same degree, although with
subjection to Error, Difficulty, by length of time, Study and Experience.
Wherefore if Adam knew all things as they were (as doubtless he did) and that
cognoscibility of beings in him, were their formality, as to him, certainly the
same cognoscibility must be their formality as to us. I could render this point
much clearer, but this may suffice to an attentive mind, and therefore shall
spend no more Time or Paper about it, deferring it until such time, which I may
happily employ for the answering of such Objections, that probably others will
make against it.

Hence we collect one member of the division of a Being, namely a Real being,
which is that, which our understanding does apprehend to exist without, in the
same manner as it does apprehend it within.

CHAP. V. Of the Formality of an Objective Being.
1. The Authors Definition of a (Ens Rationis) Being of the Mind, or an
Objective Being. Wherein a Real Being differs and agrees with an Objective
Being. 2. The Proof of the fore-given Definition. That whatever we think, when
we do not think upon a Real Being, is an Objective Being. That whatever we
think or can think, when we do not think upon a Real Being, is like to a Real
Being. 3. Another Argument to prove the Formality of a mental being to consist
in likeness to a Real Being. 4. The Division of an Objective Being.


1. THat, which a man does apprehend to be like to what he perceives by his
senses, is an (Ens Rationis) objective being, which is like to some one, or
more real Beings. And this makes the other opposite dividing Member of a (Ens)
Being in general. An Ens Rationis or an objective being, is that, whose essence
existing in the mind only, consists in a likeness to a real being. That an
Objective being as to us, is as much a being, as a real being, it appears
hence, because a being, like to another being, is as much cognoscible in its
existence, and other modes or Accidents, as a real being, to which it may be
like. It is called objective, because its essence is immediately grounded upon
the passive and active Intellect, which gives it to be objective or
representing: So that you may observe, that the sorce of the word objective,
does confirm the truth of my Definition, which is, that an objective being is,
which represents a real being, or is like to a real being. Likeness does not
imply a single or immediate Idea in the active Intellect; for that is only
proper to real beings, but a reflexe or double Idea, or the framing of another
Idea, like to the single Idea of a Real being.

A being conceived to be like to a real being, is partly different from it, and
partly the same with it. It is the same with it, or identificated in their
superior gender, which is a being. It is different, in that it moves the
passive understanding differently from a real being, that moving the
understanding by its present motion through and from it self: whereas it self
moves the passive understanding through its intelligibility or internal
cognoscibility, which it has in the active Intellect. This Intelligibility is
nothing else but the same Idea of a real being, conceived again in the absence
of that real being, which made that first Idea by its own present motion in the
understanding: In a word, it is not else, but a Recordation of a real being;
and a real being it self is nothing else, but a being apt to move the senses by
its own single and present Motion.

II. I prove the fore-stated Definition of an Objective being to be adequate to
its Essentials. If whatever we think or can think, be only like to a Real
being, and that at such times, when we are not employed in understanding a Real
being, is no real being; that Concept must be of an Ens Rationis, or Objective
being: But what ever we think, or can think, is like to a real being, and that,
at such times when we are not employed in understanding a real being, is no
real being; Ergo, whatever we think, or can think to be like to a real being,
and that at such times when we are not employed in understanding a real being,
must be a Concept of an Ens Rationis, or Objective being. I confirm the Major
Proposition, which cortaines an Argument a necessario. The Necessity flows
from a Maxim, which is that an Objective Being and real being are
contradictorily opposite; and between Contradictories there is no Mean or
Medium. But of this more hereafter.

I prove the Minor, which is, that all which we think, or can think is like to
a real being, at such times when we are not employed in understanding a real
being. Stop your ears, and shut your eyes, or compose your self to a Platonic
Ecstasy, and try, whether you can think of one or more beings, which is, or are
not like to a real being or beings; let that thought be of a being most
impossible to exist really. I am certain, I could never. You will say, that you
can think of an Atlas, or a man holding the world upon his back: I grant, that
an Atlas is an Ens Rationis; but this Ens Rationis is like to a real being:
Namely, the man is like to a man, the world like to a Globe? had we never seen
a Globe, or a man, we could never have thought upon them jointly: so is a
Hirco-cervus, a Goatstagge, an objective being, representing a Goat and a
Stagge. This Axiom does also infer the same; Nihil est in Intellectus, quin
prius fuerit in sensu; there is nothing in the understanding, but it proceeds
from our senses. If then we know nothing, but that, which we receive from our
sensation, and the Knowledge in the understanding is nothing, but a
Representation of what is recommended to it by the Senses, that which we
always think, or can think, must be like, or must represent a real being;
because we perceive nothing, but what is really existent without the
understanding. Here may be Objected, that then all real beings are objective
beings; because all real beings cause a Representation or Likeness to
themselves in the understanding. The Solution is easy. In a large sense all
real beings are objective, if objective be taken largely, for that which moves
the understanding, as Smilec. also, Disp. 1. Q. 1. well observes, Non
quaecunque existentia objectiva sufficit ad Ens Rationis; Nam etiam entia
realia existunt objective in intellectu. It is not every objective existence
does suffice to constitute an objective being; for real beings exist also
objectively in the understanding. So that I say, that it is not every Likeness
in the understanding specifieth an objective being, but only a mediate and
reflexe Likeness, which is formed out of the immediate or direct Likeness or
Idea of a real being, by abstracting another or mediate Likeness from that
first likeness. The likeness of a real being is immediate, and therefore needs
its own real presence to impress this likeness upon the understanding; whereas
the likeness of an Objective being is formed mediately from the first real
likeness (as I may call it) and is abstracted, when the real Object is absent,
that is, at such a time (as I inserted above) when we are not employed in the
understanding of a real likeness. I call it a reflexe likeness, because the
understanding does abstract it by a reflexe action upon it self.

Neither is that first or immediate likeness of a real being properly a
likeness, but rather an Impression made by its presential action; whereas a
likeness is properly that, which is abstracted from the Impression already made
by a real being, and in the absence of it, that is, when we are not employed in
the understanding of a real being. So that a proper likeness is between two
beings, formally different from one another. I will illustrate this by an
example: Frame a Likeness upon an Impression of a real being: as of a Dog; as
long as that Impression lasts, you cannot make a Likeness upon it; for we can
exercise but one act of the understanding faculty at once; For one formal power
exercises but one formal act. It is then necessary that the Impression should
be finished, by the cessation of the alteration of that real being upon the
Sensories (which I call the absence of a real being, a part rei, or the
intermission of understanding a real being a part actus Intellectus.) The
Impression being finished by the absence of that real being, namely, of the Dog,
the understanding by a reflexe and mediate Likeness upon that Impression, may
by another action relate that likeness abstracted from that Impression to that
same Dog again (which action is a distinct operation of the mind, formally
differing from that first action of receiving an Impression) and so that Dog
framed in the understanding is like to the first Impression of that real Dog
again. Where observe, that this Likeness is not the same Impression, which that
Dog made upon the Sensories, but a being abstracted in the passive
understanding, by the Active, of the same likeness to that same Impression.

III. Another Argument to prove the formality of an Objective being to consist
in a likeness to a real being, is this. As Beasts and Men are formally distinct
in their Essence, so also they are formally distinct in their formal
Operations. Hence I proceed thus. The perceiving of a real being is proper to a
Beast, the perceiving of an objective being is only proper unto men. Wherefore
as them two operations are formally different, so are their Acts, which is the
perceiving of a real being, and of a formal being, and consequently, an
Objective being does differ from a real being. These Operations being supposed
to be formally different, I say, that that which makes them formally different,
is the Ratio formalis of each. That which argues or makes a being to be real,
is its perception by the animal Senses. This is evident, because Beasts, who do
perceive and discern real beings (for they discern Grass from water, their own
Stable from another) which they cannot perceive, but by their senses: Ergo, the
perception by animal sense is the Ratio formalis of a real being. That which
makes an Objective being, is that, whereby a man is distinct from a Beast,
which is a power of framing likenesses by a reflection upon the Animal
perception or Impression, and is an act whereby a man is formally distinct from
a Beast: For a Beast cannot frame any Likeness: Ergo, The Formality of an
Objective being does consist in a Likeness to a Real being.

You may Object, that you can apprehend a being existing in your mind, to be a
real being: Ergo, Whatever is thought, is not thought to be like to a real
being, but something may be thought to be a real being. I Answer, That that,
which you think to be a real being, you think it to be like to a real being,
and because of that, you say it is a real being: For example, Suppose you think
the Pope to be a real man, your thinking of him to be so, is nothing else, but
your thinking him to be like to a man, and therefore you say he is a man.

Moreover, although an objective being consists in a likeness to a real
being, the Conclusion thence is not, that that which is an objective being, is
no real being, that is, that has no real being for its foundation: for the
definition does imply it: neither are you to conclude, that an objective being
is a contradictorily opposite to a real being: that is, that an objective being
does not respond to a real being, because a real being does not exist in that
manner of conjunction, as an objective being is sometime conceived, viz. a
Dog-cat is an Ens Rationis: now the apprehending of these both together, that
is, one a top the other, does not make them formally and essentially distinct
from each other, supposing them to be conceived distinctly; for that is but
accidental to them, and in effect, they are conceived distinctly in the same
manner, as I have declared in the Sixth Chapter. This then being granted to be
accidental to an Objective being, we must necessarily suppose each of them
singly (viz. the Dog and the Cat) existing at present only in the
understanding, to be an objective being: What, will you call them beings real
beings, which now, are existent only in your understanding, and cannot move
your cognoscible faculty really from without at the same time, when you know
them from within? Further, supposing, that each Component of a compounded ens
rationis, is an Ens Rationis (as formally it is, for how can a whole compounded
ens rationis be said to be an whole Ens Rationis, unless its parts are likewise
Entia Rationis? (Nihil est in effectu, quin prius suerit in causis) there is
nothing contained in the effect, but what was before existent in its Causes,
and such as the effect is, such must the Cause have been) it is impossible,
that you can think or conceive any such components, but which are respondable
to a real being. Neither is it proper to call that being, which you have
conceived in your mind, to be like to a real being, although that real being be
before you, a real being, because now it is objective, and existent in the
active Intellect, moving the passive Intellect actually: But in case you leave
that Objective being, and reflect your senses to that same being which is
before, then that being, which does now move your sensual cognoscibility, is
said to be a real being. But here you may say, that an objective being is
formally different from a real being, wherefore an Objective being ought not so
much as to have a power of existing really, which according to this Discourse
it has, and therefore the fore-stated Definition of an Objective is not to be
allowed. I Answer, That an Objective being is formally different from a real
being, and is impossible ever to be formally a real being: For, in that I
assert a being to be Objective, I assert that it is not real, neither can an
Objective being quatenus objective, be real, quatenus real. Lastly, Is a Mule
more or less an ens rationis, because it is generated from different Species,
or constituted in unity by part^ of a different Species? Certainly no. So,
neither is a (Hirco cervus) Goat-stagge more or less an Objective being,
although consisting of Parts of different Species: and as a Mule is not termed
an ens reale, because it consists of different Species; So, neither is a
Hirco-cervus an ens rationis, because it consists of different Species. But
you reply, that a Hirco-cervus is impossible to exist really. Why? Because it
does consist of different Species. And what does that hinder? That it may, is
plain in a Mule. Wherefore I say again, that it is impossible for a man to
think a single notion, which should be impossible to exist really. But more of
this elsewhere.

An Objective being is twofold, Modal, and essential Objective. A modal
Objective being is, which is like to a modal real Being. An essential Objective
Being is, which is like to an essential real Being. What a real Modal, and real
Essential Being is, we shall deliver in the next Chapter.

CHAP. VI. Queries concerning a Real and an Objective Being.
1. Whether an Objective Being and a Real Being differ essentially one from the
other. 2. Whether a Rose in the Winter is a Real Being. 3. If Impossibility be
the Formality of an Objective Being. 4. Whether the Ratio formalis of an
Objective Being consists in a conjunction of many Beings, which in that
Conjunction are Impossible to exist really. 5. That an Objective Being is not
existent before it is understood. A Confutation of Smigl. 6. That an Objective
Being is only proper to the understanding.


I. Whether an Objective and Real being differ essentially one from the other.
My Answer is affirmative: Because they are constituted by powers formally
different from one another. Here may be objected, If a man has powers in him,
formally differing from one another, a man must also have two Forms.

I answer again, That these formal powers are not called formal in respect of
the Soul; for in that respect they are all formally one; but they are different
from one another in respect to one another, and both different from the Soul
materially, or, ex Part Ob-jecti.

II. Whether a Rose in the Winter be a real being. No doubt it is not; for it
moves the understanding by a mediate and reflexe likeness. 2. It does not move
the understanding from without. For a Rose in the Winter is supposed impossible
to be actually in the Winter; Ergo, it has only an Objective Being.

III. If Impossibility be the Formality of an Objective being. Impossibility is
twofold. 1. It is that, which cannot exist without the understanding. 2. It is
that, which cannot exist in the understanding: That which has no
cognoscibility, is no being: Wherefore the latter of these is no being, and
does not appertain to this Query.

The first kind of Impossibility is not the formality of an Objective being;
because Impossibility is a Negative, and therefore having no unity, cannot be
the Form of a Positive. 2. State the Question thus; Whether possibility in the
understanding, which is a positive, is the formalis Ratio of an objective
being: neither, For a possible Objective being is that, which can move the
understanding, but does not; that which does not move the understanding, has
no objective cognoscibility: Ergo, it is a non Ens Objectivum.

IV. Whether the Ratio Formalis of an Objective being consists in a Conjunction
of many Beings, which in that Conjunction are impossible to exist really. In no
manner: because of the Reasons alleged in the precedent Paragraph. Neither is
an Objective Concept of a conjunction of many beings essentialy different from
the objective concept of each single being. As one being is produced, so are
two or more; For example, as the Species of a man's head is conceived, in the
like manner is the Species of a Drakes body apprehended; as Union is conceived
by apposing one as close as may be to another, from seeing of it done by real
things; so also does the Species of Objective Union, appose the head of the man
to the body of that Drake, and so it is a Man-Drake, which is a whole objective
being. Its parts of production are three; namely, The Species of a man, a
Drake, and Union. This supposed, it follows, that they are essentially one:
because all Parts united are essentially identificated with the whole. Lastly,
It is not the Union which makes an Ens Rationis; for that is ab extra to them
Species, which are already conceived, to wit, from the understanding, which is
distinct from the Object understood. As the mingling of Oil with Water does not
formally alter the Essence of the Water, or the Water the Essence of the Oil;
so neither does the joining of a man's head to a Drakes Body, formally alter
their Essences; if only joined, that is, by contiguity; but if united, which
includes a continuity of Parts, then they are formally one.

V. Whether an objective being may be existent before it is understood. If
cognoscibility is the Form (as to us) of a real Being, much more is it
essential to an objective being. That it is so, is already proved. 2. An
Objective being as far as it is Objective, is not fundamentally before it is
known; and this is against Smigl. Disp. 1. q. 5. I prove it. If an Objective
being, as far as it is so, was fundamentally, before it was formally, as to us:
Ergo, A Being (as to us) is before it is; but that is absurd: For Impossible
est, idem esse, and non esse. 2. To be fundamentally formal, and to be
absolutely formal, are two forms different in essence: but it is impossible to
a Being to have two essential Forms: Ergo, A Being cannot be fundamentally a
Being, and an Objective Being at once.

I prove the Major. To have a being in another, as upon its Basis or
Foundation, is a relative Essence, which cannot exist separately without its
Basis: But a Relative Essence is formally different from an Absolute Essence,
which in a manner is the proper Essence of an Objective Being: Ergo,
Essentially and Formally different. That the Essence of an Objective Being is
absolute, I prove, That which does formally exist without a real present
foundation, is an absolute Being; but an objective being does exist without a
real present foundation; for it existeth when a real being is removed, and
hidden from our Senses: Ergo, an objective being in a manner is an absolute
formal Being. Nevertheless, as I asserted before, it is respondable to a real
past foundation. An Objective being cannot be so much as known in its
foundation, as it is so founded. I prove it. To know a being, and to know it to
be in its foundation, are two distinct Knowledges at once. But the
understanding cannot know two things at once. This Minor is a Maxim. Ergo.

We may know an objective being to be, and to have its essence derived from a
real being, as its foundation, but at distinct times, and by distinct acts of
the Intellect, and that but improperly. Had Smigl. said so, he would have
escaped the forementioned inconveniences. I prove the Conclusion. An objective
being is a likeness in the understanding to a real being. Ergo its Essence is
derived from thence: for had there never been a real being, there could not
have been an Objective being. A real being is the foundation of an objective
being: because it is referred to a real being. Neither is this properly a
foundation; because an objective being can exist without a real being; so that
a real being is rather to be supposed, as a conditio sine qua non, or a Pattern
of an objective Being; if a Pattern, then it is no foundation: for a thing
abstracted from that Pattern does exist, when the Pattern is abolisht: We may
see the Picture or Representation of Alexander, although he has long since
quitted his real Being. According to this we may Metaphorically define an
objective Being to be a Picture of a Real Being, painted in the Mind.

The said Smigl. in the next Page, recals his Notion, and does again affirm the
contrary, with as little Proof, as the other was. Ens Rationis formaliter non
potest esse nisi cognoscatur. Primo probatur in iis entibus Rationis, quae sine
ullo fundamento finguntur ab Intellectu: ut Hirco-cervus. Mark, he allows some
Beings not to be inherent in a Basis, whereas before he granted, that all
beings were fundamentally; but he could not tell, whether their foundation was
the understanding, or Realities from which they were abstracted. If he took the
Understanding to be the Foundation of an Ens Rationis, then he confounds the
foundation of a being, and the Subject of it, into one Notion; for the
understanding is properly the Subject of an Objective Being, and not its
Foundation, which rather may be attributed to the real Impression, upon which
an Objective Likeness is founded. Nevertheless supposing his mistakes to be
true, and allowing either of these Acceptions, he contradicts himself.: For
here he asserts, That an Objective Being cannot be formally, unless it is
actually understood; before he says, that it can be fundamentally (that is,
inherent in the understanding, or else in the first Impression of a Real Being,
take him either way) in the understanding, before it is known, Can there be any
thing in the understanding, but what is understood? If there may, then the
understanding is no understanding; neither will this Excuse, in saying, that a
Being is fundamentally one, and formally one; for to be fundamental includes a
Formality in a Foundation.

2. He affirms, That the Fiction of a Hirco-cervus has no foundation, which is
erroneous also: for it is grounded (or does properly resemble a real Buck or a
Stagge) upon a real Buck and a real Stagge. The like Contradictions are
frequent throughout the whole Dispute.

Whether an Objective Being is only proper to the understanding. If an
Objective Being is a Being, because it is intelligible, it is necessarily only
appropriated to the understanding. As for a being in the will or rational
Appetite, it is (as all desires or beings desired are) appropriated to the
understanding; because the understanding and will are formally one, as to the
Rational Faculty; neither can the Will will any thing, unless it be first
represented in the understanding. Sensitive Powers cannot frame an ens
rationis, because their proper Object is a Real Being.

CHAP. VII. The Manner of Forming an Objective Being.
1. That all Formations of an Ens Rationis are single. That the Second
Operation of the Understanding is the same in Specie with the first. A Division
of an Objective Being into Single and Complexe. 2. That a non Ens cannot be
known. Two Acceptions of a Non Ens.


ALL Formations of an Ens Rationis are from a single and first Operation of the
understanding.

2. The second Operation of the understanding is the same in specie with the
first, differing only numerically: The like may be said of the third. The first
operation of mind is, whereby we conceive an Objective Being singly, without
any Conjunction to another, and is nothing else but an Impression of the
Fancy, expressing a real Being, made upon the understanding; and this is a
single Image: As for example, the Image of a Dog in the mind, is by the first
Operation. The second Operation is, when two Images are joined together, which
happens by the Affixion of one Image upon the other. Let the Dog
forementioned be the first Image, and the Image of a Cat be another Image; this
Image affixt upon the Dog, will make a Dog-Cat; and this we can imagine but
confusedly; namely, a Body of a Dog, with a Cats head, or some Member of one,
and some of the other, which w^ apprehend united into one Essence, from having
perceived by our senses a like Union of two Essences into one, which is nothing
but a confusion of Accidents in one: These Accidents are confused thus; Suppose
that the real Image of a Dog is impressed upon one Plate, and the Image of a
Cat upon another Plate: First make the Impression of a Dog upon Paper with its
Plate, next place the other Plate of a Cat crucially, or transversly, upon the
first Impression. That Image will represent the half of a Dog, and the other
half of a Car, to wit, the Neck and Head of a Cat, the Body is common, that
being so united by the placing of the Plate; likewise there is the Head and
Tail of a Dog: all these being so united in the Body seem to make a Dog-Cat:
This Dog may more or less resemble its own entire representation (or so may the
Cat) according to the placing of the other Plate upon it; for if the other
Plate is directly placed upon it, then it loses its own Representation, if
obliquely, then according to the manner of that obliquity, the one is more
represented than the other. So likewise a complexe Ens Rationis is framed by
the second Operation of the understanding; first it elicites one Being out of
the Memory, which having made an Idea in the passive understanding, the active
understanding elicites another being, which being immediately placed (as it
were) upon this other Idea, which may hide the greater or lesser part of the
first Idea, and so the understanding comes to apprehend a complexe Idea by a
double or second Operation. Here may be demanded, how the understanding can
apprehend a double Idea at once, since that the understanding, as it is
formally and materially (formaliter and materialiter) one, can apprehend but
one thing at once. You say it is formally one, because it is distinct formally
from the other faculties, it is materially one with all the other Faculties of
the soul, because Faculties in this latter sense are taken for Determinations
of the Acts of the Soul upon Objects. I resolve you thus: The understanding
does not apprehend two objective Essences at once, no further then them two
essences make one, that is, one Representation. They make one in this manner:
The understanding elicites in the Fancy one Idea, The Fancy being as a
fluid continuous Air, expanded in the Brain, (for of that nature are Animal
Spirits) is capable of receiving that Impression. This Impression made, holds
no longer then the understanding does act upon it, for the understanding
understands by making through its own immediate virtue an Impression upon the
Fancy; like to the same Impression, which it had once produced upon it by an
abstraction from without. Then the understanding frames another being by
degrees, one part after the other, and being intent in making that present
Idea, its virtue having lost the formerr Idea, the first Idea loses somewhat of
its perfect Impression; for the Fancy is just like the Quicksands on the
Seashore, whereon if you make an Impression, that Impression will remain as
long as the thing impressing remains applied to it, and some while after; but
being removed, the Sand comes by degrees to its own plain Form again: Now if
you impress another Impression upon the first, the last Impression does obscure
the first; yet nevertheless joins its Figure to the other, which two are like
to one. This double Impression Smigl. Fol. 46. calls Compositio Objecti, and the
Speculation upon this Composition he names Compositio actus. Enquire in my 2d
Book, of second Part, and you may know further.

Wherefore hereby I would infer, that the Speculation of the understanding upon
these two Impressions upon the Fancy, is one formally and numerically; but
the acts of impressing of the understanding are many, differing only materially.

2. That the first Operation of the mind, which here I take for an Act or
Impression of an Idea by the understanding upon the Fancy, is no wise
formally different from another (as the Second or Third may be) succedent upon
it.

Hence I infer the Division of an objective Being into a single objective and
complexe Objective Being. What they are may be collected from the Precedents.

A Non Ens cannot be known, because it cannot be impressed: for it has no
Figure. We say It or That Quiddam is a Non Ens, not because we know that
Quiddam which we speak of, to be a Non ens, for a quiddam and a non ens are
Contradictories; but because we conceive that quiddam not to be like to another
quiddam, which we had expected it should have been like to, and therefore we
say, it or that quiddam is a non ens; so that a non ens in that signification
is only a difference of one being from another; and in this sense, we say one
thing is not another, as a man is no Beast, or no bestial thing that is, is a
nothing bestial (non ens bestiale) or not that, which does represent a Beast.

2. A Non Ens is taken for that which has no Resemblance to any thing real,
nor consequently to any thing we can know; for we can know nothing, but what
has a resemblance to a real being, wherefore we call a non ens that, which
cannot or does not move our sense or understanding. A non ens reale is that,
which cannot or does not move our cognoscible faculty from without. A non ens
objectivum is, whatsoever cannot or does not move our understanding from
within. So that a non esse implies little more then (quies) rest of the
understanding from Action, happening through a not moving non-cognoscibility.

CHAP. VIII. Of the Formality of a Real Being.
1. What a Real Being is according to the Author. The Derivation of res and
aliquid. That it is very improper to call it a real Being. The Cause of that
Denomination. 2. That the Fancy is the immediate Subject of an Ens Reale. 3.
That the Understanding is only the Mediate Subject of Real Beings.


A Real Being is that, which move; the understanding from without. Res and
Aliquid are Synonima's of a real being: For it is called Real from Res; and
aliquid from aliud quid. Let us enquire why Res and Aliquid should more be
Synonima's to a being from without, then to an Objective being. Certainly Res
and Aliquid rather imply a being in general, then any of its Species in
particular. And it is probable, that Ens was framed out of Res, by leaving out
the R, and placing N. between E and S. How absurd is it then to say Ens Reale,
which is the same, as if you said Ens Ens. For Reale is nothing else but an
Adjective changed out of the Substantive res. Aliquid might rather be called
unumquid, and it is likely, that it was first so called, which others probably
did change out of a wantonness of Speech, coveting new words, and rejecting old
ones, as it is observable at present among most Nations, who frame new words
every year, which although are but few in a year, yet all them yearly words,
being retained in use for a hundred years, beget a great change of Speech,
until at last, the whole Language seems to be changed: Wherefore in stead of
unum, they prefixed ali- and made the word Aliquid. It may be you will divide
its Etymology in aliud and quid, and then it will signify the same with
something else. However its intended signification was Something, which in
English seems to be composed out of one and thing? leaving the S out, and
changing M in N. From which Premises it follows, that (ens ab extra) a being
from without, would more properly denote the same which is intended by a Real
being. And (ens ab intra) a being from within, might more properly denominate
what is expressed by Objective: because Objective may as well be attributed to
a Real being as to it.

Nevertheless there may be a Reason given why res or a real being was imposed
to denominate a being from without. That which man perceived first, was a being
from without, and consequently did first impose the name of a thing or res upon
it, which without distinction did then properly denote that being from without;
for the name of a Being from within was as then not yet conceived: wherefore
that name was originally and immediately intended to denominate a being from
without, and has since been retained in use.

II. The immediate Subject of an Ens reale is the Fancy. I prove it: that
which does distinguish real beings one from the other, is also the Subject of
their inherence (that is, quoad ad cognoscibilitatem) But such is the Fancy:
Ergo. I confirm the Minor: The immediate Subject must be either the
understanding, or animal Fancy. But not the understanding, because Beasts,
which are void of understanding, do distinguish Real Beings from one another.
Ergo, The Fancy is the immediate Subject of Real beings.

III. The understanding is the mediate Subject, because the understanding
perceives the same real beings by mediation of the Fancy. I prove it: If the
understanding cannot perceive a real being, when the Fancy is tied, which is,
when a man sleeps, then the Fancy is the mediate cause of the perceiving of a
real being. But the understanding cannot perceive real Beings, when the Fancy
is tied. Ergo, the Fancy is the mediate cause, by whose mediation the
understanding becomes the Subject (Subjectum cognitionis) of a Real Being.

CHAP. IX. Of the Division of a Being in Universal and Singular.
1. A Being is divisible into universal and singular. 2. What an universal
being is according to the Author. 3. What an universal Real being is. 4. What
an universal Objective being is.


1. IN the foregoing Chapter has been treated concerning the next Division of
a Being; now follows the remote division of a being in Universal and
Singular. This Division is communicable to each of the next divided Members:
Thus a real being is either universal or singular. So again an Objective being
is either universal or singular. The Proof of these Divisions you will read
below.

II. An universal being is a being common to two or more Singulars. Commonness
here is a likeness in Idea of two or more beings. I prove the Definition. 1.
That there are common Beings. If two or more singulars do move the
understanding in likeness of Idea, and the understanding does perceive two or
more motions of singular Idea's to be one in likeness (for a being must be one,
and cognoscible in that unity) then there are common or universal beings. But
two or more beings move the understanding in likeness of Idea, and the
understanding does perceive two or more motions of singular Idea's to be one in
likeness: Ergo there are common or universal beings. I confirm the Minor: Two
Horses move the understanding in likeness of Idea; they both having one shape
and commonness in external habit, make a like Impression in the Fancy, and by
that hoth are distinct to the understanding from other beings; as from Fishes,
Birds, etc. ergo, Two or more beings move in likeness of Idea. 2. There is not
only a commonness required, but also an unity, or how could they be beings
else? Nam Ens and unum convertuntur. I prove that this commonness is one: If
this commonness of Idea be indistinct from it self, and distinct from all
others, then it has an unity; but this commonness is indistinct from it self,
and distinct from all others. Ergo.

The Concept or Impression of two shapes of Horses are indistinct from
themselves; for you find no distinction in a likeness, as far as By Figure
understand; the Habit of Modes in one essence
they are like, otherwise they would not be alike. It is distinct from all
others, because no other beings can represent the same likeness of Figure, and
not be Horses. Ergo.

III. A real universal being is, which moves the understanding from without. I
have proved, that there are common unities moving from without; If so, Ergo,
there are common real unities. Beasts discern common real beings. I prove it: A
beast, as a Horse discernes an edible being from a non edible being: but edible
beings and non edible beings are commonnesses: Ergo. The Minor is undoubtable;
for hold forth a stone and Hay to a Horse, he will refuse the stone, and take
the Hay. You may say, a Horse does not know Hay as an universal but as a
singular. I deny that, for a Horse knows Hay, because that Hay, which he takes
now, is like in externals to the Hay, which he used to eat.

2. A Horse knows Oats from Hay; for hold Oats and Hay to him, he will take
Oats before the Hay: Now he does not take Oats before the Hay, because they
are such individual Oats, but because they are like to Oats, which he used to
eat. You will reply again, that a Horse knows Oats and Hay from a Natural
Instinct. I deny that also: for had a Horse no senses, his Natural Instinct
would not make him choose Hay before a Stone. Besides, it is apparent in a Dog.
Suppose a Dog were between a Rank of men, and a Rank of beasts, he would leave
the beasts, and run to the men: Ergo, he knows men from beasts: he runs to men
in general, as they have all a commonness of men in them. The Reason, why the
Dog runs to men, is, because a Dog having been accustomed to live with one
singular man, he runs to all them men, because they are like to that singular
man: Ergo it follows that a Dog knows Resemblances.

IV. There are universal objective beings. An universal Objective being is,
which does represent an universal real being in the understanding. If there
were not universal real beings, how could we apprehend universal objective
beings? For Nihilest in intellectu, quin prius fuer it in sensibus. For
example, man conceived in the understanding, is an universal objective being:
because he represents a commonness of two or more men. If the understanding
apprehends a man; ergo there are objective universal beings: because the
apprehension of a man in the understanding is an objective being: But the
understanding apprehends a man: Ergo.

By this Discourse I may seem to have mistaken my self in giving the Definition
of an Objective, whose formality consisted in a likeness to a real being,
whereas now again I assert, that the formality of an universal real being
consists in a likeness between two or more Singulars, wherein then (may you
ask) is a single objective being different from an universal real being? I
Answer, 1. In that the likeness of an objective being is formed by the
understanding, but the likeness of real beings is perceived by the Fancy or
common sense. 2. The likeness of an objective being is a single likeness
compared by the understanding to a single real likeness, whereas the other
likeness is a plural and common likeness. 3. The Likeness, which intercedes
between real singular beings, is between beings of the same Rank and Gender,
whereas the likeness of an objective being to a real being is between beings of
different formalities; the one existing without and moving from without; the
other existing within, and moving from within.

CHAP. X. Of universal and singular Beings.
1. That there are no Platonic Idea's. That universal beings are not really
different from their Singulars. Wherein an universal is distinguished from a
singular. That singulars being abolisht, universals thence abstracted, are also
abolisht with them. 2. That universal Beings are formally distinct from
singulars. 3. Singulars are primum cognita. 4. Universals are notiora nobis.


1. THere are no universal beings really distinct from singular beings, as was
the Opinion of Plato, in that he stated Idea's really distinct from singulars,
because singular beings when they are abolisht, the universals are also
abolisht in them. As for the Arguments of Plato against it, they are very
futil; whereof this is one of the primest. There are Sciences: Ergo, there are
universals. I grant it, but not really distinct from their Singulars. You may
reply, that Sciences are Necessary; therefore their Subject, which are
universals, must be necessary: But they cannot be Necessary, if inherent in
singulars; because Singulars are contingent. To this I answer, That if all
Singulars were so contingent, as to alter their Habit and Shape, so as that
they had one shape now, another tomorrow, I confess singulars would be
contingent; but singulars in their quidditative shape or habit are not
changeable, so as to change all in singular from that quidditative shape. It Is
true, some singulars may be abolisht, yet as long as there are two left, the
universality, which they did constitute, is not abolisht, but maintained by
them two, There must be two at least, because if there was but one, it could
have no commonness; for commonness relates to another or more. Many Singulars
may change in many Accidentals, as in one or more particular Moodes; yet this
does not change the quiddity of a being, unless all Accidents together (which I
call a quidditative shape) change in all Singulars. Since then that these
changes are not observed in singulars, they are not to be counted contingent,
but as necessary as their Sciences. Another Argument he proposes, is this: All
singular men being abolisht, yet there is a Science of man, as he is an
universal: Ergo. The Falsehood of the Antecedent appears from the truth of the
contrary; to wit, that there is no Science of man, man being abolisht in all
his Singulars; for a Science is a Science as to us only: not but that there is
also a science in spiritual beings, but that not concerning us farther than is
revealed by the Holy Bible we consider all things besides only as to us. 2.
Suppose that Fishes were all abolisht, yet you may say, there remains a
knowledge of fishes in us. It Is true, there does remain a knowledge of fishes,
but not of real fishes, but of imaginary fishes, like to those which have
existed. 3. Universals, as they are Subjects of Sciences, are Entia Rationis,
which do remain after the existence of real universals.

II. Universal beings are formally distinct from their Singulars joined all in
one number, because they differ in their Definition. A singular being is that,
which has a single Essence. By single is to be understood incommunicability
(that is, quoad accidentia omnia collecta co, quo sunt, modo) according to all
its accidents collected in the same manner as they are; for although their
prime and most obvious Accidents are common to them of another being, as they
are abstracted from Accidents less obvious (which kind of abstraction
constitutes an universal being) yet the (...) of all the Accidents of a
singular being collected, is only proper to that singular being, and
incommunicable in that (...). I cannot but strange at the Conceit of most
Peripateticks, who take an universal being to be only a communicable and
abstracted unity. This communicable unity is the Matter and Form of singulars
abstracted from their individual Accidents. Pray, what Concept can you have of
Matter and Form without Accidents? What can you conceive the Matter and Form of
an Ass to be without his Accidents, as hairy skin and long Ears, and singular
figure of Body?

III. A Singular is primum cognitum, because we must know these first, before
we can conceive an universal being.

IV. A universal being is Notitu nobis, or is better known to us then a
singular; for we can discern the shape and (...) of an universal being, before
we can know the (...) of its singular beings. For afar off we know that a man
is a man, that is, is like to the universal being, before we know, what man he
is, or know his individual Connexe of Accidents. 2. It is easier to know an
universal being than a singular; for oftentimes when we see a singular person,
we doubt whether he be the same which we have seen before, yet at that time we
know him certainly to be a man, and like to his universal being: besides, we do
less forget an universal being, then a singular, and so consequently it is more
known.

The Reason why an universal being is more known to us then a singular, is
because the Modes of an universal are the most eminent and evident Modes of
singulars, abstracted from their more obscure and inferior Modes.

V. One singular is not enough to constitute an universal, because there can be
no Resemblance abstracted from one. You may object, that the understanding may
abstract an Idea from one singular, and frame another like to it within its
self; that granted, it could be no universal being, neither real or objective;
not real, because there is no resemblance of one real Idea to another, unless
there be another existent; but of an objective Idea to one real Idea: not
objective, because the resemblance of Idea's are of different Natures.

VI. An universal Nature is by means of Abstraction, as it does also include
Comparation. Smigl. in his 4th. Disp. Q. 8. proposes his Opinion of the manner
of Production of an universal. Universale fit per potentiam abstractivam rerum,
non cognoscitur nisi per comparativam. An universal being is constituted by an
abstractive knowledge, but it is not known unless by a comparative knowledge,
Wherein he ass ts that an universal being is capable of an essence before it
is known. That this is not, is evident by what has been proved in the 6th.
Chapter. You may plainly observe a Contradiction in these words of his. Fit
(says he) per notitiam abstractivam: Ergo cognoscitur. Etenim quomodo potest
universale dici fieri per notitiam, and non cognosci? Quippe fieri per notitiam
abstractivam, and cognosci abstractive, sunt idem re and nomine. Siquidem
cognoscatur abstractive co ipso cognoscitur; ergo cognoscitur eo ipso, quo sit
puncto. To this he annexes a triple Principle, contributing to the production
of an universal being, to wit, Negation of Abstraction of Unity, and of
non-repugnance: which being stated, an universal is also stated. By Negative
Abstraction is meant, an universal Nature abstracted from its singulars by
predicating it negatively of the singulars. I wonder how a thing can be
negatively predicated of another, and it not known. If known, ergo it is,
before it is predicated of another. Therefore it is no Negative abstraction.
Unity is inseparable from a Concept, for all Concepts are one, and of one; so
that that is implied in a Concept. His third Condition required a
non-repugnance; which is co-incident with the whole falsehood of his imagined
Universale. A non-repugnance is a Negative, and therefore is not essential to
an Universale; that being Positive. Ergo, It must rather import a positive
relation to its Inferiors. Here again you have another Contradiction. First,
he says that an universal being cannot be known by a comparative knowledge.
What is a comparative knowledge, but a common Nature actually and positively
resembled and compared to its Inferiors? This by the way, and now I return to
my Proposition. By Abstraction is intended the Apprehension only of
Commonnesses in singulars; which Apprehension of Commonness does per se only
apprehend what is common in singulars, and thereby does exclude the
Apprehensions of Non-commonnesses: Wherefore 1. Abstraction does per se imply a
Positive, and per accidens a Negative. 2. Abstraction does include Comparation,
because Commonnesses cannot be abstracted unless compared to one another.

CHAP. XI. Of the Extreme Division of a Being.
1. Another Division of a Being. 2. What the greatest or most universal is. 3.
What the greater universal is. 4. What a less universal is. 5. What the least
universal is. 6. How the Forementioned Members are otherwise called.


I. AN universal being is either most universal, greater universal, less
universal, or least universal.

II. The greatest or most universal is, which is common to all beings; as a
transcendent being, or a being, as it is the Subject of Metaphysics.

III. A greater universal being is, that which is comparatively abstracted from
less universals; as a living being is abstracted from men, beasts, and Plants,
because they have a Commonness of Idea, as far as they are living: This
Commonness is abstracted from men, Beasts, and Plants, as they are less
universals.

IV. A less universal being is, which is abstracted from the least.

V. The least universal is, which is immediately abstracted from Individuals.

VI. Among Logicians the greatest universale is termed universale
universalissimum, or Genus summum. A greater universal is called Genus
intermedium or subalternum, or majus universale. A less universal is known to
them by the Name of Species subalterna or media. The least universal is also
named Species specialissima or infima. These Terms are of great use in Logic,
and being proper to that Art, they are considered there in a different manner
to what they are here; wherefore I shall omit any further Discourse upon them.

CHAP. XII. Of the Modes or Parts of a Being.
1. What a Mode is. Whence a Part is named a Part. Whence a Mode is termed a
Mode. The Scotch Proverb verified. 2. The Number and Kinds of Modes. What an
Essence or a whole being is. 3. That a Mode is the Summum Genus of all Beings,
and their Parts. 4. The vulgar Doctrine of Modes rejected. 5. That a Substance
is a Mode of a Being. 6. That a Mode is an univocal Gender to a Substance and
an Accident. 7. That a Substance is an Accident, and all Accidents are
Substances. The Difference between Subsistence and Substance.


1. IT is time I should propose somewhat touching the Modal Division of a Being,
which is its partition into Modes.

A Mode is that, whereby a being is incurrent into our Knowledge. I have often
told you, that a being, as to us, is a being from its cognoscibility, that is
from our perceiving it to be something. Our Perception is either sensual or
intellectual: The latter whereof is obliged to the former for all its
knowledge. Wherefore a real being is a real being from its sensible
cognoscibility; and an objective being is an objective being from its
intelligible cognoscibility. We know a being either in its whole or parts. The
Parts are called Parts, Divisions, and Partitions; because they are apprehended
by us divisedly or parted, as they are inherent in a being; or because they
part or divide our perception, that is, move it in a distinct manner. The
distinct motions, partitions and divisions of Parts are otherwise termed Modes
or Manners, because they do modificate the Senses; that is, move them in
various manners. These we say are real, because we imagine them to be just so
in nature, as we apprehend them to be. We must then give credit to that trite
Maxim of the Northern people of this Island, who vulgarly cry out, Ouut awaa al
tings ar bot nootiens. Modes are little else but the various faces of a being,
through which it makes it self known to us as it were in various manners. We
know a being in the whole, when we know it in all its Parts or Modes.

II. As many several manners as a being does move the senses through, so many
several Modes there he. A being moves the Senses through its Unity, Truth,
Goodness, Existence, Substance, Quantity, etc. Their Number you will find in
the 14th. Chapt.

Attributes, Accidents, Properties, and Modes are Synonima's. They are called
Attributes (a part actus) because our Intellect does attribute them to the
various motions of a being upon the Senses. Accidents are imposed upon a being,
because they befall to it accidentally, or by chance from our understanding.
Properties are so called, because they are proper to a being, and without which
a being cannot consist.

We cannot say, that a being is any thing else but its Modes united; for if we
say, it is something beyond them Modes, we say more then we know; for we know a
being no further then its Modes, or no further then it moves our Senses.
Besides, take away unity, truth, substance, quantity and the remaining Modes
from a being, what can any man imagine to be the Overplus? even nothing. But
more of this in the Next Chapter.

III. Hence I gather, that a Mode in a large sense is the summum Genus of all
beings, because it predicates of all beings and their Parts. It predicates of a
whole being, because in a large sense it imports the manner of Representation
of an entire Essence.

A Mode is more or less universal, or Singular. An universal Mode is a
Commonness of singular Modes. A singular Mode, is inherent in every singular
being.

The more and less universal Modes I have enumerated in the 14 Chap. Their
Descriptions you may read in the Following Chapter.

IV. The Vulgar of Philosophers state a different description of a Mode. A
modal Entity or Mode (say they) is that, which cannot be separated through the
Divine Power from that, which can be without it, in respect to which a thing is
said that other thing, which is separated from it. Wherefore that, which can be
separated in two Entities, but not reciprocally, is said to be a thing: and
that which cannot exist without, is called a Mode. You have an Example in
Matter, which is united, and in its union, through which it is united, that
same Matter can through the Divine Power exist without the same Union to that
individual Form, in union to another distinct Form: but that union cannot
through the Divine Power exist without that very same Matter. Whence it is,
that the union is said to be the Mode of Matter, and the Matter is said to be
the thing in respect to that union. The same Distinction I conclude from this
Doctrine to be intercedent between Action and the Agent Principle; as also
between Passion and the Patient Principle: between Subsistence and its Nature.

By this they seem to suppose a real difference between a Mode and its being or
Nature; but withal they assert, that this real difference of existence is not
Natural, but Supernatural.

If then there is no Natural real difference between a Thing and its Mode;
Ergo, According to their own Opinion, a Mode is identificated Naturally and
Really with the thing, and consequently a thing must be constituted out of the
Congress of its Modes.

V. I say that a Substance is a Mode of a Being. For it is evident from their
own words, that it is Naturally inseparable from its Nature; ergo, a Substance
is naturally and really the same with a Nature substant or subsistent. 2. A
Substance does as much and as properly modifie its Subject as any other Mode:
for by it a being appears to our sense to be subsistent or substant. 3. A
Substance has no other Subject to inhere in, then them other Modes united, but
more especially it inheres in quantity: that is, a being does become a Substant
to other Accidents or Modes by means of its quantity: For if you take away
quantity from a being, whereby shall that being become a Substant to other
Modes? 4. To subsist of it self is not the Essence of a being: For they confess
that supernaturally it is separable from its Essence; Ergo It is somewhat else,
and can be nothing but a Mode. 5. A Mode is that, whereby an Essence is in part
made known to us: but an Essence is in part made known to us by its subsistence
or existence per se: Ergo, it is a Mode. Or thus: The Parts of an Essence are
distinguished from one another by their Modes or distinct manner of
Representation to sense, but a Substance is distinguished from another Mode
through its distinct manner of Representation; Ergo. 6. If a Substance agrees
in moving the Senses, in inseparability, in time or duration, with other Modes;
Ergo, it is neither more or less a Mode then they. But the Antecedence is true,
Ergo the Consequence is true also.

Any other Mode is as little separable from its Essence without the destruction
of it as a Substance: For take away Quality or Quantity, it will destroy the
Essence as much as the separation of a Substance; the like conceive of their
Quality, Duration, etc. as all other Modes are variable, so is a Substance,
which may be augmented and diminished; for a Substance sometime becomes a
greater or lesser substance, from the Augmentation or diminution of Quantity.
Lastly, You say that a substance is that, wherein all the Nine Accidents do
inhere tanquam in Subjecto. But then tell me what that thing is wherein all the
Nine Accidents do inhere? Possibly you will say, that that wherein the
Accidents are inherent is latent; that is, is not cognoscible. But again, if it
be not cognoscible, how do you know it then to be a thing? Ergo, you speak more
then you know: If so, wherein is it distinguished from a Chimaera?

VI. A Mode is an univocal Gender to a Substance and the other Modes; because
it is equally predicated of them.

VII. The Consequence of this Discourse does infer the Division of a Being in a
Substance and Accident to be erroneous; because an Accident is affirmatively
predicated of a Substance; for a Substance is nothing else but a Notion, which
accidently or by chance is attributed by us to a being.

Every Mode of a being is predicable of a Substance, and a Substance of it. For
every Mode is subsistent through it self, that is, it need not another to
constiture its formal modality. To subsist through it self, is not to subsist
through another, but every Mode subsisteth through it self, and is through it
self, that which it is; for Quality does not owe its Subsistence to Quantity,
nor Quantity to it; but each of them subsist through themselves, and are Modes
through themselves. Each singular Mode cannot subsist of it self, as needing
the concurrence of all the other modes; and therefore they subsist or depend
from one another. This Dependence from one another might rather be termed
Substance (quia unum alteri substat i. e. unum alteri est fulcimento) because
the one does stand under the other as a Pillar to uphold it. Subsistence does
more properly denote the subsistence of a Mode through it self.

CHAP. XIII. Of the Attributes of a Being.
1. Why a Property is so called. 2. The Difference which Authors hold between
Passion and Attribute. 3. That Passion and Attribute, as to their Names, imply
the same Thing. 4. That Attributes are really the same with their Essence. That
all Attributes of a Being, as they are united, are the same with their Essence
or Being. 5. That the Attributes are formally distinct from one another. 6.
That that, which we conceive beyond the Attributes of a Being, is nothing. 7.
What an Essence is.


I. A Property or Propriety of a Being is so called, because it is not the
essence of a Being, but does concomitate it, as a Proprium quarto modo, flowing
from its Quiddity. These in Physics are termed Passions, which are Properties
Physically derived from their Essence, and are individually concomitants to it
out of the Nature of the thing. In Metaphysics the same are named Attributes,
because they are attributed from our Understanding to a Being.

II. Although Passions and Attributes do formally signify the same thing,
nevertheless have Late Authors retained a formal Distinction between them: to
wit, in that Attributes are physically identificated, but formally distinguished
from their Entity; but Passions are both Physically and formally identificated
with their Entities.

III. Passion and Attribute, as to their Names, are identificated, and imply
the same thing; for it is called a Passion (a Patiendo) from Suffering, because
a Being does suffer such a distinction from us, that is, from our Mind and
Understanding. So Attribute is imposed from our understanding, because it does
attribute such a distinction from our Concept to a Being. Wherefore to be
attributed unto from our understanding, and to suffer from our understanding,
imply the same thing.

IV. Attributes are really the same with their Essences, because they cannot
exist asunder. All the Attributes of a being, as they are united, are really
and formally the same with their Essences. A real Formal Distinction arises
from a specified Concept in our minds of two or more real Entities. The
understanding cannot have a formal specified Concept of two or more real
Entities, unless they are really distinct, that is, move the understanding
distinctly from without. Wherefore all the Attributes united, moving the
understanding in the same manner as the Being or Essence it self, must be
really and formally the same. That the Being it self and its Attributes move
the understanding in like manner, is evident: For wherein does a being move the
understanding, but by its Attributes united? And wherein do the Attributes
united move the understanding, but by their being and Essence? You may enquire,
why then Attribute does in its formal Concept signify distinctly from the
signification of a being? I Answer, that a being, as to us, is an Essence
composed out of the congress of all its Attributes or distinct manners of
moving the understanding, which if considered separately are called Attributes,
if united, a Being or Essence.

V. Attributes are formally distinct from one another, because each moves the
understanding in a distinct manner, which causes a distinct Concept; which
concept (a part actus) defines their Formalities or quidditative
Representations distinct one from the other.

Attributes are not really distinct one from the other, because they cannot
exist asunder.

Attributes may also be called Modes in a strict sense, as they do signify a
distinct manner of moving the understanding.

VI. That which we conceive of a being beyond its Attributes, is nothing (a non
ens) for we can neither describe or define it.

VII. Hence we may conclude, that Essence (as to us) is a Representation of all
the cognoscible Attributes of a being in unity.

CHAP. XIV. Of the Kinds and Number of the Attributes of a Being.
1. Whence the Number of the Attributes of a Being is taken. 2. The Number of
Attributes constituting a Being. 3. All Attributes are convertible one with the
other, and each of them, and all of them in union with an Essence or Being. 4.
That all the Attributes of a Being are equal in Dignity and Evidence. 5. That
the Order of Doctrine concerning these Attributes is indifferent.


I. THe Attributes of a Being are as many, as are requisite to make it
cognoscible.

II. The Conditions or Attributes concurring to the Cognoscibility of a Being
are, Unity, Truth, Goodness, Existence, Subsistence, Distinction, Termination,
Perfection, Necessity, Quantity, Quality, Relation, Action, Passion, Situation,
Duration.

These do all concur to the Cognoscibility of a Being, because one of them
being defective, we cannot know a Being perfectly.

III. All their Attributes are convertible one with the other, and each of them
with a Being. Thus all, which is true, is good; all what is good, is existent,
etc. So all what has Quantity is a being; all, what has Quality, is a being,
etc. Wherefore one of these: Attributes being stated, they are all stated: and
one being abolisht, they are all abolisht.

IV. They are all of an equal Dignity and of the same Evidence, (quoad Naturam
and quoad nos) If any may be said to be the Root or Foundation, it must be
Unity; for a thing must be one, before it can exist: But since there may be
replied, that nothing can be one before it is existent; there can be no ground
stated.

V. Neither is it any matter, which is treated of first, they being all of one
Dignity and Evidence: Nevertheless, I shall observe the received Method in
Discoursing on them.

CHAP. XV. Of Essence and Existence.
1. That Essence and Existence are generally received for Principles. 2. That
Essence is no Principle. 3. That Existence is no Principle. 4. What Existence
is according to the Opinion of the Author. 5. That Existence is intentionally
distinct from Essence. 6. That Essence is perfecter than Existence. 6. That
Existence is formally distinct from Substance.


I. ESsence and Existence are generallly received for the two Principles of a
Being: But how they are Principles, and why so received, is not so generally
explained. Principles are internal and original Causes; namely, the first
Causes of all the Passions and Attributes, which do concomitate their Position;
internal, because they through their presence constitute the whole.

II. Internal Principles are constituted at the same time; so (materia secunda)
the Second Matter (according to Arist.) is constituted at the same moment of
time, when the Form does advene. But an Essence is an Essence (according to the
same Philosopher) although Existence is not advened to it. Wherefore they are
no constitutive Principles.

You may say that Essence is like to (Materia Prima) the First Matter, and
therefore may be like to it, in that it is a (Principium generationis)
Principle of Generation, to which it is not improper to be before the advent of
a Form: Wherefore Essence may be taken for a Principle of Generation. Suppose
that granted, to wit, that it is like to Materia Prima, in that it can be
without a Form, it is no consequence, that it should also be a Principle of
Generation, because a Principle of Generation is changed into another thing, by
the advent of a Form, as Materia prima is no longer a Materia prima at the
Advent of a Form, but a Materia secunda. But as for Essence, although Existence
is adjoined to it, it remains essence still, and is in no wise changed.

III. Existence is no Principle, by reason it is no original Cause through it
self of all the Affections of a Being, but a concomitant affection of an
Essence. You may object: That through Existence, all the other Passions are
attributed to the Essence; so that if an Essence was not existent, none of the
other Passions could be related to it. I Answer: The same Objection may be
applied to any of the restant Attributes: as, if an unity was not adjoined to
an Essence, the other Attributes could not be related to it. Wherefore all the
Attributes of a being are equal one to the other, and all together are equal to
the whole, which is the Essence.

IV. Existence is an Attribute, whereby a Being is actually constituted. By
Existence a Being is seated beyond Generation, and reduced to an Ens
constitutum, vel generatum, so that Existence does follow the Position of all
the Attributes in union: or rather is, whereby the Position of all the
Attributes in union is produced. Wherefore Essence without existence is only a
Chimaera, and impossible to be.

V. Existence is distinct from an essence (intentionaliter) by the operation of
the mind; because it moves the understanding in a manner different from the
motion of an Essence.

Actus Essentialis and Existence are Synonima's: for they denote the same
thing, neither is there any distinction between them, either ex part Objecti,
or ex part actus; that is, really, or intentionally.

Essence is perfecter then Existence; because Essence comprehends in it
Existence, and all the other Attributes.

Existence is formally distinct from Substance or Subsistence, in that the
latter is an Attribute constituting a being independing from another: but
existence denotes only a Position of all the Attributes in union. This Question
does somewhat puzzle Oviedo, Fol. 286. Met. Cont. 2. Where he doubts wherein
existence is distinct from a Substance. He is forced to Answer, that the
existence of a Substance is a Substance, and the existence of an Accident is an
Accident: although a little before he admits of a formal distinction between
them. By this Answer it would follow that a Substance were an Accident, and an
Accident a Substance; because they agree in uno tertio incommunicabili: for
existence is only communicable to a being; ergo a Substance and Accident are
one being.

CHAP. XVI. Of Unity.
1. That Unity superaddes nothing Positive to a Being. 2. What Unity is. That
Unity properly and per se implies a Positive; accidently and improperly a
Negative. What is formally imported by Unity. 3. That Unity is illegally
divided in unum per se, and unum per accidens.


I. UNity does superadd nothing Positive to a Being. For Unity is essential to
a being; that is, it constitutes part of its Essence: Without which unity, a
being is no being. Wherefore nothing can be said properly to be superadded to a
being, unless a being were a being without it, and before it; or unless it be
no part of a being.

II. Unity is an Attribute of a being, by which it is one in it self, and
distinct from all others.

To be one in it self, is to be not many, and to have but one Definition, or
one Formality. A being may be divided into many, notwithstanding each of them
many are one still after their Division: And if you proceed to an infinite
Division (as it were) each Particle divided will be one still in it self,
before its Division. Wherefore unity is inseparable from a Being. By one in it
self, understand a positive unity, not negative: for a Negative is a Non Ens.

Unity formally is not an indivision of a being in it self; because indivision
is accidental to it: For if Division be accidental to a being, Indivision must
also be accidental to it. Unity does rather include or imply an Identity of
Parts to the whole. By unity a being is distinct from all others: that is, each
being by its unity moves the understanding terminatively, by which terminative
motion one being is distinguished from another being. By terminative understand
a Positive, a Negative being incognoscible.

III. Unity is illegally divided in unity through it self (unum per se) and
unity by accident (that is through another) or unum per accidens: Because all
real unities are one through themselves; and consequently all formal unities
(that is, unities ex part actus) are also one through themselves. You may
object, that a Heap of Corn, a House are unities per accidens. I Answer, That a
Heap of Corn, as far as it is a heap, is one through it self; because it does
represent it self by an unity: which representation is the ground of a formal
unity, or unity ex part actus. I prove it to be a formal unity, because the
understanding can define it: Ergo, it is one: For whatever is definible, is
one. Why cannot a heap of Corn represent an Object one in it self, as properly,
as a Multitude or heap of Individual men represent an Universality? Why cannot
a House, although it consists of Parts, when divided from their whole (namely
from that House) differing one from the other, constitute an unity in its
Object, as justly, as an individual man, who consists also of Parts, when
divided, different from one another?

Unity is either Numerical, Specifical, or Generical; that is, more or less
universal or singular.

CHAP. XVII. Of Truth.
1. Why Truth is called transcendent. 2. What Truth is. 3. An Objection against
the Definition of Truth. That a Monster is a true Being. That God although he
is the remote efficient Cause of a Monster, nevertheless cannot be said to be
the Cause of evil. 4. Austins Definition of Truth. 5. That Falsehood is not
definible. How it may be described.


I. TRuth here is called Transcendent from its constituting a being in its
Transcendence.

II. Truth is an Attribute of a being, whereby it appears to us to answer its
end, or to that, which it was intended for. To Answer its end consists in the
Conformity of a being to the Pattern or Idea in the Divine Mind. All beings are
created by the all-creating God for an end; and therefore are necessarily true,
because they must necessarily obey their end, as having a necessary Cause,
which is Gods Ordination.

III. Against the Definition of Truth, as it is Transcendent, may be Objected:
That a Monster is a Being; but a Monster is not answerable to its end; because
its end was to be perfect: therefore all beings are not true, that is,
answerable to their end: To this I Answer, That a Monster is a true being, in
that it answers to its efficient and material Cause; as in this case, a Child
born without a head, is a perfect Natural living being, but is not a perfect
Humane being that is, it is imperfect as to its humane body: Nevertheless it is
perfect as to its Natural and vegetable being, which suffices. Here a further
Reply may be made, that God did not only ordain beings to be perfect, as to
their Natural Perfection, but also as to their vegetable, animal, and rational
Perfection; for his Ordination upon Herbs was, that they should increase by
bringing forth Seed of the same kind; that Beasts should multiply after their
own kind. To the clearing of this doubt, we are to observe, that Gods
Ordination was related either to the Species, or to every individual future
being, or to both. It is most probable it was to both, particularly to man, for
whose sake the same extended also to other creatures. We are likewise to
remember man in his twofold state, to wit, of Integrity and Deficience. Gods
Ordination then upon man was, that he, and all other Animals and Vegetables for
his sake, should increase after their own kind, during man's Integrity. This
Ordination upon Gods Creatures is answered and effected by Powers and
Dispositions created by him in them: According to which Powers, all Creatures
acted. All the Actions of man did therefore depend from his Powers; to wit, his
Propagation from his Generative Power, which again was subjected to his
Fancy, and that to his will and understanding: Wherefore as long as his will
and understanding did will and understand nothing, but what was perfect, his
Fancy could receive no other Impression, but of Perfections, which could not
cause any Error in the Generative power, and therefore had man abided in his
entire state, he nor any other Creatures could have generated Monsters. Man
having through his deficience corrupted his Faculties, no wonder if their Acts
are also corrupted, and their effects corrupted, and corruptible: Hence then it
is beyond scruple, that Gods Ordination did immediately relate to the Powers of
all Creatures, and herein are all beings true, and answerable to their end, and
therefore perfect. You may urge an Inconvenience to follow this Solution;
because thereby God seems to be the original cause of Monsters or evil: for if
God had conferred perfect powers upon man, man could not have changed them of
himself: wherefore God must be supposed to alter them dispositions and
faculties. I Answer, That God was not the original cause of this alteration,
but man himself through his sin: which therefore was the first impulsive cause.
It Is certain, that God was the efficient cause of this Alteration of Powers;
yet Gods Act was not evil therein, but good and perfect, because his Justice
did require it: for this change upon man was his punishment: If so, none can or
will attribute the evil following a punishment of a Malefactor, to him that
punishes, or to the punishment it self, but to the Malefactor, whose Default
and Crime was the cause of that evil, which befell him after his punishment.

IV. Austin in the 5th. Chap. 2 Book of his Soliloquies states the Description
of Truth. Truth is that, which it is; and in the same Chapter opens his
meaning. Truth is that, which is so in it self, as it appears to him that
perceives it, if he will and can perceive it. Hence do Hurtad. Disp. 7. Met.
Sect. 1. and Soar. Disp. 7: Sect. 5. infer the Nature of Truth to consist in a
cognoscibility of a being to the understanding of that, which it is. This
Opinion as it is obscure, so it is exposed to doubts, if not to falsehood. The
truth of a man does not consist in my knowing a man to be a man, and that he is
no other thing but a man; for that is a quidditative Concept of a man, namely
to know him to be a man; but to know a man to be that, which he was intended
for, is the concept of his truth: Wherefore Soar. in the same Chapter, does
well recall himself, in asserting that truth is relative to created and
increated Knowledge.

Truth does not superadd extrinsecally (ex part actus) any denomination really
distinct from a being, since it is concurrent to the constituting of the nature
of a being: for take away truth, and you take away the essence of a being.

V. Falsehood is defined by most Philosophers to be that, which appears to be
that, which it is not. It is strange that falsehood, which is not in rerum natura,
should be defined. It is not in rerum natura, because all beings are true. If
it can be defined, it is a being, For nothing is definible unless it is a
being; had it been described by a Negative, then indeterminatively we might
have perceived it; as thus, Falsehood is, which does not appear to be that,
which it is, or which it was intended for: I say indeterminatively, because we
know a (falsum) falsehood to be a falsehood, because it does not determinate our
Concept through its truth; so that this is a privative or accidental knowledge.

CHAP. XVIII. Of Goodness.
1. What Goodness is. The Improbation of several Definitions of Goodness. 2.
The Difference between Goodness and Perfection. 3. What Evil is. 4. What the
absolute active End of Goodness is. 5. That Goodness is improperly divided in
Essential, Accidental, and Integral Goodness. 6. How Goodness is properly
divided. 7. That the Division of Good in Honest, Delectable, etc. does belong
to Ethics.


I. GOodness is an Attribute of a Being, whereby it is for an end. Many
Philosophers do omit the Definition of Goodness, because they can find no
distinction between Truth and Goodness. Others define it to be a convenience of
a being with the Appetite; which is erroneous, for Goodness is in a being, that
is, a partial being, without the Appetite. 2. Goodness is absolute, a
Convenience is relative. Timpl. Chap. 9. of his Metaph. 2 Book, defines
Goodness to be an act of Good, as far as it is good; or is a Quality, from
which a being is denominated Good. This is Idem per Idem, and Obscurum per
Obscurius.

II. Goodness is formally distinct from Perfection, because a being, according
to what it is good only, is not perfect. Wherefore Goodness is erroneously
defined by some to be a Perfection.

III. Evil (Malum) is that, which does not appear to us to be for any End.

IV. The Absolute active End of Goodness is to constitute that, which it is.
The Passive is to be constitured that, which it is.

V. Goodness is improperly divided into Essential, Accidental, and Integral
Goodness; because Good is that, which is essential of it self to a being, and
therefore cannot be accidental, as it is opposite to Essential: It may be an
Essential part, because it concurs with the rest of the Attributes to the
constitution of the Essence of a Being.

VI. Goodness is divisible according to the divisibility of a being, which is
either Natural, Animal, or Humane.

VII. The Division of Goodness into Honest, Delectable, and Profitable or
Useful, does not appertain to this Doctrine, but is referred to Ethics.

CHAP. XIX. Of Distinction.
1. The Authors Description of Distinction. That the privative sense of not
being moved is a Note of Distinction, whereby the understanding distinguishes a
Non Ens from an Ens. That the Positive sense of being moved in another manner,
than another Ens moves the understanding, is a Note of Distinction between one
Being and another. 2. How Distinction is divided. What a real Distinction is.
3. What a Modal Difference is. 4. That the vulgar Description of a real
Distinction is Erroneous. 5. That the terms of a Distinction between two or
more real beings are requisite both or more to exist. 6. That one term of
Distinction although in existence cannot be really predicated of another not
existent. Oviedo and Hurtado Examined. 7. What a formal Distinction is a part
actus, and how otherwise called. 8. What a Distinctio Rationis is. How
otherwise named.


I DIstinction is an Attribute, whereby a being does terminate the
understanding: Or Distinction is the termination of the cognoscent power made
by the term of the cognoscibility of a being. Distinction, as it does
concomitate a Positive, is intrinsecally identificated with Unity, as it does
privatively imply a Negative, or as much as it does imply beyond Unity, it is a
Non Ens, and not cognoscible; for example, Peter is cognoscible to me, in that
I know him to be Peter: the said Peter does terminate my cognoscible faculty by
his terminated Accidents or Modes, because beyond them Accidents of Peter, I
conceive either nothing, or something, which does not move my understanding by
its accidents, as the Accidents of Peter did: So that by not being moved in my
understanding, or by being moved in another manner, I know that one being is
not another, that one being is not nothing. I know that one being is not
nothing, because it moves my understanding. I know that one being is not
another, because it moves my understanding otherwise then another being does;
which knowledge is called a distinction. A Distinction therefore is nothing
else but a Non ulterior cognoscibilitas rei, sive ex part Objecti, sive ex
part Actus; or a non cognoscibilitas simpliciter. Wherefore a non ens may be
properly called ex part actus a non cognoscibilitas.

Distinction here, as it is relative to a being in its transcience, is, whereby
we know it not to be nothing: We know a being not to be nothing, because it
moves the understanding terminatively: wherefore that, which we apprehend
without, or beyond the term of the Modes of a being, is nothing. Distinction,
as it is a Positive, is coincident with Unity, and is not to be referred to it
as a different Mode.

II. A Distinction is either Real or Modal. A Real Distinction is, whereby an
entire Essence moves the understanding differently from the entire Essence of
another being. What Essence is, has been declared at large, and thence may
easily be conceived, how one Essence differs from another.

III. A Modal Difference is, whereby one Mode of an Essence moves the
understanding differently from another Mode contained in the same Essence: So
that a real difference is between things and things, and a modal difference is
between Modes and Modes.

IV. A Real Difference is generally taken to be between two beings, which can
exist asunder; as two essences or Beings: but two Accidents or Modes of one
being cannot exist asunder; which notwithstanding are counted by them to be
really different; wherefore they must either mistake in their Definition, or in
supposing two Accidents inherent in one essence, to be really distinct.
Besides, this is rather a property of a real difference, and not its
Description or Definition; for were it derived from the essence of a being, it
would be a Definition; but since it is deduced from Existence, which is only a
Property of a being, it is no Definition or Description.

V. The Terms of a Distinction between two or more Real Beings are Requisite
and Necessary both or more to exist. I prove it in this Proposition; Bridget is
not Mary: We cannot say, that Bridget is not Mary, unless both existent; for
the species of Bridget moving the understanding in a distinct manner, and Mary
moving the Intellect in another manner, are two terms of distinction: Now how
can these two terms move the understanding as two real beings, unless existent?
You may say, that although Bridget is not existent, yet she has existed, and
by that species she moves the understanding: That is impossible; For how can
Bridget move the understanding from without, and she not be existent from
without? 2. If this improper motion were granted, yet Bridget not being in
existence, we cannot say, Bridget is not Mary, but we may say, Bridget was not
Mary; for is denotes a presence, and an actual existence.

VI. We cannot really predicate one term of Distinction, although in existence,
of another not existent: which if otherwise we do, then that term, which is not
existent, is equivalent to a non ens: as is evident in this Enuntiation; Paris
is not Troy. Here Paris does really move our understanding from without, but
Troy does not; for it is not in rerum natura. Wherefore these two cannot be
predicated really of one another. But if each considered as objective, then
they may objectively be denied of one another. 2. Paris taken as a real being,
and enunciated of Troy as no real being, amounts to a non ens, and is the same,
as if you said, in stead of Paris is not Troy, Paris is not nothing. In the
same sense is a Chimaera taken for a non ens, because it does not move the
understanding from without: as, a man is no Chimaera, that is, a man is not
nothing, or a non ens.

VII. Authors have involved themselves in such absurdities, and strange terms,
that they do thereby render themselves and their Opinions inexplicable; whereas
there is no ordinary capacity, but may easily attain to the understanding of
these Metaphysics, which all along I have demonstrated by sense: What
barbarous discourse do we find in Hurt. and Ovied. upon this very Subject;
which for to unlock, I have studied to unfold the Doctrine of Precision and
Distinction, in a plainer Discourse.

Oviedo makes it a great difficulty to distinguish the concept of Peter and a
Horse: and no wonder, if it proves so unto him, since he proceeds upon an
obscure foundation of distinction: Neither can he light upon any at all; For in
his Met. Contr. 4. P. 1. he writes thus; Some say, that the Objective Concept,
by whose force this positive being is not another formally, does imply a
Negative: But Hurtado, and many others teach better, that the same positive
essence of a being is signified in a Negative manner. I have said more of this
Contr. 3. Where I have proved that or this being not to be another: as Peter
not to be John, does imply a positive Concept of a being, without importing
formally any other Negative: Thus far Oviedo. Here you have the foundation of
Distinction stated by the forementioned Author; but if narrowly examined, will
prove no foundation. And as to the first Opinion, which is, That the Objective
Concept, etc. What force is it, which a Positive being has, whereby it is not
formally another? This is not propounded by them, and therefore it is no
Foundation. The Answer to this, I have plainly and briefly set down in the
first Paragr. of this Chapt. 2. How can an objective Concept imply a Negative?
The Resolution of this is also by them omitted. The Second Opinion asserts,
That the same positive Essence of a being is signified in a Negative manner.
This is no ground of Distinction; because a positive being is signified
negatively: therefore it is distinct. This is Idem per Idem; a positive being
is signified negatively, therefore it is a Negative, or is distinct. Oviedo
himself reaches somewhat nearer to the truth of the Matter: He says, that for
a being not to be another being, does imply a positive concept; and so it does:
But how, or in what manner, he omits. It is by moving the Intellect (as I have
proved before) in a sundry manner, or by several Modes. But to return to the
Resolution of the Distinction proposed: Wherein Peter is distinct from a Horse.
Oviedo imagines, that Peter is distinct from a Horse through his Unity: which
does distinguish him from another, in that it does represent that it is not
that unity. This is a Mistake; for Peter's single unity does only make him
distinct from a non ens, and not distinct from another being, unless that being
moves the Intellect about the same time one after another: wherefore two
unities are compared in the Intellect, which being different in their Idea,
cause a distinction between themselves: For how can I deny, that one unity is
not another, unless both conceived and compared to another.

VIII. That, which is a Real distinction a part objecti externi, or Rei, is
named a formal distinction a part actus: It is named formal, because the
Intellect conceives a distinct form of each being from another, and thereby
forms the Definition of it, which is nothing else but the explication of the
form of a being.

IX. The same, which is denominated an objective distinction a part objecti
interni, is signified a part actus, by a (distinctio rationis) distinction of
the mind, whereby the mind does distinguish internal Objects otherwise, then
they do exist really or without, or otherwise, then they move from without.
Here I may seem to contradict my self, although I do not, in saying here, that
the Intellect does, or may understand Objects from within, different from them
which move from without: and in another preceding place of this Book, I
concluded, that the understanding could not understand or conceive any being
from within, but what was like to beings from without. To reconcile these two
places; you are to observe, that an Objective Being may be like to a Real
Being, either in some of its Modes, or in all: If in all, then the being from
within is like to the whole essence of the being from without; but if in some,
then them some are unlike to the whole, in the same manner as a part is unlike
to the whole. Wherefore in this, the understanding may perceive an Object from
within distinctly from an Object from without. 2. The understanding cannot
perceive any being, but what is like to an entire being, or one or more Modes
of a being from without. 3. The understanding may also conceive some modes of
one being, and some of another, which modes both united, cause a distinct
objective being in that union, to what they were from without in disjunction.
4. In this example the understanding cannot perceive but what is like to
Externals, for each of them modes are like to some one mode or other of beings
from without, although here they are disunited, yet are united in the
understanding. How modes or Objects are or may be united in the understanding,
I have showed in the 7th. Chapter of this Book. As for other divisions of
Distinction may be easily collected from what is contained in the foregoing
Chapter.

CHAP. XX. Of Subsistence.
1. What Subsistence is. What it is to be through it self, from it self, and in
it self. 2. That a Nature cannot be conservated by God without Subsistence.
That the Transubstantiation of Christ's Body and Blood into Bread and Wine,
according to the supposition of the Papists, is impossible. Oviedo's Argument
against this Position answered. 3. The kinds of Subsistences. 4. What
Termination is. 5. What Perfection is.


1. SUbsistence is an Attribute of a Being, whereby it is through it self.
There are many Locutions of this Nature; which, although they seem to be the
same, yet are much different; as, to be from it self, through it self, and in
it self. To be from it self, denotes a non-dependance from any pre-existent
cause: and according to this sense God is only subsistent, that is, is a Being
from himself. In this Acception did Cartesius very well deny, that a Substance
could not be an univocal Genus to God and his Creatures. To be through it self,
expresses a being consisting of its own parts, and not of another parts; and
in this sense are all beings subsistent or Substances. To be in it self,
signifies a singleness of Existence, which is to consist only of a single
unity, and of no parts; so is God said to be in himself: Did a being consist of
parts, then it must be said to exist in its parts; for it would be very
improper to say, that a compound being did exist in it self: But a being
consisting of no divisible parts, we are compelled to say, that it is in it
self.

II. A Nature cannot be conservated by God without Subsistence. It is
contradictory: For take away the Subsistence of a being, you take away its
parts; for Subsistence is nothing else, but the essence of a being, through or
in its Parts. This is a very necessary Tenent, for to defend this Assertion,
viz. That the Subsistence of the Bread cannot be the corporal Subsistence of
Christ; and therefore it implies a Contradiction, that Christ should be really
and essentially changed in the Subsistence of Bread, and the essence of both
remain. The Lutherans have stated a more probable Opinion, that Christ's
Substance was united to the Substance of Bread: which is something less
erroneous than the other. Oviedo strives to prove the contrary, in Contr. 6. P.
6. His Argument is this: Nature is before Subsistence in respect of causality:
Therefore Nature is understood to be existent, before Subsistence is
understood. I deny the Antecedence, which is palpably false; for take away the
Subsistence of a thing, and you destroy the being of it: and state a
Subsistence, and you must necessarily state a being.

III. Subsistence is divisible (as all other Attributes of a Being) in a first
Subsistence, and in a second Subsistence. The first is proper to Individuals
and Singulars: the Second to Universals.

IV. Termination is a Property of a Being, whereby it is terminated.
Termination is in all beings, in Spiritual and Natural beings: in God, and in
his Creatures.

Gods Termination is not to be termined, and therefore he is Infinite. A Non
Ens has no Termination, wherefore Authors say very improperly, that a Non Ens
is infinite. All other beings are termined, and therefore are finite.

V. Perfection is a Property of a being, whereby it is completed with all, or
in all, belonging to the Constituion of its Essence.

CHAP. XXI. Of remaining modes of a Being.
1. What Quantity is. 2. What the Kinds of Quantity are. 3. What Quality is. 4.
What Relation is. 5. What Action is. 6. What Passion is. 7. What Situation is.
8. What Duration is.


I. QUantity is an Attribute of a Being, whereby it has Extension of Parts.

II. Quantity is either Formal and Immaterial, which is the extension of the
Form, beyond which it is not, and within which it acts: or Material, which is
the Extension of a material Being.

III. Quality is, whereby a being does act; as from a Cause.

IV. Relation is, whereby one being is referred to another.

V. Action is, whereby one being acts upon another, as through a means.

VI. Passion is, whereby one being receives an Act from another.

VII. Situation is, whereby a being is seated in a place. A Place is, which
does contain a Being.

VIII. Duration is, whereby a being continues in its Essence.

CHAP. XXII. Of Causes.
1. What a Cause is. That the Dectrine of Causes belongs to Metaphysics. 2.
Wherein a Cause and Principle differ. 3. What an internal Cause is. What Matter
is. 4. What a Form is, and how it is divided. 5. What an external cause is.


I. A Cause is, whereby a Being is produced. It does appertain to Metaphysics
to treat of Causes; for else it would be no Science, which requires the
unfolding of a being by its Causes. Ramus did much mistake himself, in denying
a place to the Doctrine of Causes in this Science, and referring it altogether
to Logic: It Is true, that the Doctrine of Causes may conveniently be handled
in Logic, as Arguments by which Proofs are inferred: yet as they are real,
and move the understanding from without, they may not; for Logic is conversant
in Notions only, and not in Realities.

II. A Cause differs from a Principle, or is Synonimous to it, according to
its various acception. In Physics it is taken for that, whose presence does
constitute a Being; and in that sense it is the same with an internal cause, to
which a Cause in its late extent is a Genus, and consequently is of a larger
signification.

A Principle sometimes denotes that, whence a being has its Essence, or
Production, or whence it is known. In this sense did Aristotle take it, in the
5th. Book of his Met. Chapt. 1. Whereby he did intimate a threefold Principle;
to wit, a Principle of Constitution, Generation, and of Knowledge, or of being
known. A Principle, as it is received in the forementioned sense, is of a
larger signification, then a Cause.

It is usually taken for a word Synonimous to a Cause. In this Acception is God
said to be the Principle (that is, the Cause) of all Beings.

III. A Cause is either Internal or External.

An Internal Cause is that, which does constitute a Being by its own Presence.

An Internal Cause is twofold. 1. Matter. 2. Form.

Matter is an internal cause, out of which a being is constituted. So earth is
the Matter of man, because a man is constituted out of Earth.

Matter is remote and mediate; which is, out of which the nearest and immediate
matter was produced or constituted; or nearest and immediate, out of which a
being is immediately constituted, For example; The nearest matter of Glass is
Ashes: the remote: is Wood, which was the Matter of Ashes. But this Distinction
does more properly belong to Logic.

IV. A Form is a Cause, from which a being has its Essence.

A Form is remote or nearest. A remote form is, from which a being consisting
of remote Matter, had its Form.

The nearest Form is, from which the nearest Matter has its Essence.

The remote matter is either first or second. The first is, out of which the
first being had its Essence.

The Second is, out of which all other beings had their essence.

A Form is divisible into the same kinds. The first Form was, from which the
first being had its essence. The second, from which all other beings have their
essence: These Divisions are rather Logical then Metaphysical.

V. An external Cause is, by whose force or virtue a being is produced. The
force whereby a being is produced, is from without: for a being has no force
of it self, before it is produced: therefore that force, whereby a being is
produced, is necessarily from without. This Cause is only an efficient Cause.

Other Divisions of Causes I do wittingly omit: because some are disagreeing
with the Subject of this Treatise, and belong to another Part of Philosophy:
as, to treat of the first cause, belongs to Pneumatology: of final Causes, to
Morals: Others are very suspicious.

CHAP. XXIII. Of the Kinds of Causes.
1. The Number of real Causes. That a final cause is no real Cause. The
Causality of Matter and Form. 2. The Division of an Efficient. 3. That an
Efficient is erroneously divided in a procreating and conservating Cause. 4.
That the Division of a Cause into Social and Solitary is illegal. 5. That the
Division of an efficient Cause into Internal and External is absurd. 6. That
all Forms are Material. 7. That there are no assistent Forms.


I. THere are only three real Causes of a Being; a Material, Formal, and
Efficient Cause. Wherefore a Final cause is no real Cause. I prove it: A real
Cause is, which does really effect or produce a Being: But these are only
three: Ergo.

2. A Final Cause does not cause any effect concurring to the constitution of a
being, as each of them three forementioned do: for matter causes an effect by
giving her self, out of which a being may be constituted: A Form does produce
an effect, by giving through her presence unity, and distinction from all
others, to Matter. An efficient Cause effects by educing a Form out of the
matter, and uniting it to the Matter: Which three causalities are only
requisite to the production of a complete being; and they constituted in actu,
constitute a being at the same instant: If so, what effect does a final Cause
then produce? Certainly not any contributing to the essential constitution of a
being: These three being only necessary, any other would be frustaneous.
Possibly you will object, that the final Cause moves the efficient. Suppose I
grant that, it does not infer, that it concurs to the real and essential
production of a being. The causality, which it exercises, is in contributing
per accidens to the constitution of a being: which if only so, it does not
appertain to this place; neither can it be equally treated of with Causes,
which do act per se.

II. An End moves the efficient: An efficient is either Natural or Moral.

Natural efficients are moved necessarily, or act e necessitate Naturae: Hence
we say, a Cause being in actu (to wit, a Natural Cause) its effect is likewise
necessarily constituted in actu. It is not so with a final Cause; for that may
exist without producing an effect.

All Natural Causes move for an end per accidens, in that they answer the
Ordination of the Creator, who has created all things for an end; which
accordingly act for the same out of Necessity of Nature.

Moral Efficients are moved by an end: Yet it is not the end, which produces
the effect, but the efficient it self.

You may demand, to what Science or Art it belongs to treat of final Causes?

I answer, That they are treated of in Logic, and Moral Philosophy, but in a
different manner: Logic discourses of final Causes as Notions, thereby to
direct the understanding in enquiring into the truth of things: and Ethics
treats of them, as they are dirigible to Good and Happiness.

III. An Efficient Cause is erroneously divided in a procreating and
conservating Cause. A procreating cause is, by whose force a being is produced.
A conservating cause is, by whose virtue a being is conservated in its Essence.
I prove that this Division is not real, but objective only. The dividing
Members of a real division, must be really distinct from one another. But these
are not really distinct, etc. Ergo. The Major is undeniable. I confirm the
Minor: All beings are conservated by the same Causes, by which they were
procreated: Therefore really the same. I prove the Antecedence. Nutritive
causes are conservant causes. But Nutritive causes are the same with
Procreative causes: Ergo. The Minor is evidenced by a Maxim: Iisdem nutrimur,
quibus constamus. We are nourished by the same causes, by which we do subsist,
or have our Essence. Wherefore Nutritive or Conservant Causes are really (for
by Nutriture we are conservated) or a part rei the same; differing only
objectively a part actus.

Here you may answer, that these Instances are of material causes, but not of
Efficients. To this I reply; That no cause can be a conservative cause, but a
Material Cause. As for an Efficient cause, I prove it to be no conservating
cause. That, which conservateth a being, must conservate its essence: namely,
Matter and Form: but Matter and Form are conservated only internally by
apposition of that, which is like to what was dissipated, or which is like to
themselves. Wherefore an Efficient can be no conservating cause, because it
acts only externally or from without.

A being might be conservated externally, if its impairment did befall it from
without, that is, from an external Agent; which is only accidental to it. An
efficient then may Logically be called a conservative cause per Accidens.

IV. An Efficient is likewise divided in solitary, and social. A solitary
Efficient is, which produces an effect alone, or without the assistance of
another cause. A social cause is, which produces an effect jointly with
another: As, two Watermen rowing in one Boat, are social causes of the moving
of the Boat through the water. This Division is no less illegal then the other.
I prove it: All beings act alone and in unity, as far as they are Causes; and
although two or more concur to the effect of a being, yet they two act
formally, but as one, and their Ratio Agendi is one; Ergo formally they are but
one, as far as they are Causes yet in the foresaid instance, as they are men,
they are two, which duplicity is accidental to a cause.

The same Argument may be urged against the division of a cause in a cause
perse, and a cause per Accidens, in univocal and equivocal, in universal and
particular.

V. An Efficient is Internal, or External. An Internal Efficient is, which
produces an effect in it self. An external Efficient is, which produces an
effect in another. This division is stranger then any of the rest: The
strangeness consists in this, that thereby a being is capable to act upon it
self, and consequently upon its like: Which if so, what can it effect, but
that, which was before? It cannot produce a distinct being, because it does not
act distinctly, but identificatively: This granted, infers, That the Soul being
the internal cause of its Faculties (as they affirm) cannot produce any thing,
but what is like to it self: Consequently, that the Faculties are identificated
with the soul, and thence that a Substance is an Accident, and an Accident a
Substance. 2. A Substance acting upon it self, that is, upon its (sibi simile)
like (for what is more like to a Substance, then it self) produces a distinct
effect, and not its like; which is another absurdity following the
forementioned Division. I^ will also follow hence, that a substance does act
immediately through it self, which is against their own Dictates. To remove
this last Objection, they answer, that a Substance may, or can, and does act
immediately through it self by emanation, but can or does not act by
transmutation. They describe an emanative action to be, whereby an effect is
produced immediately, without the intervent of an Accident. This description
does not distinguish Transmutation from Emanation; for transmutation is also,
whereby an effect is produced without the intervent of an Accident; and so
transmutation may be as immediate to its Agent as emanation. If there is any
difference, it is this, in that emanation is an action not terminating or
influent upon any other being, but in and upon it self. Transmutation is the
Termination of its Influence upon another being. Pray tell me, why emanation
may not be as properly called transmutation, as not? for there is no effect,
but which is different from its cause, and changed by its cause: For if it is
not changed, it remains the cause still; Ergo Emanation is also a
Transmutation. The Faculties of the Soul are said to be emanative effects; Ergo
they must be its understanding Faculty only: for this only does not terminate
in any other being, but in it self: As for the other Faculties, to wit, vital
and sensitive, they are effects of the soul terminated in other beings; Ergo
These are no emanative Actions, as they affirm them to be. That, which has the
most probability of being an emanative action, and distinct from transmutation,
is the understanding faculty of the Soul. Neither is this action distinct from
Transmutation. That, which does change the soul, is an Object, but the soul of
it self alone does not act or cannot act upon it self, unless it be changed by
an Object; for were there no Object, the Souls Rational Faculty would be
nothing and frustraneous; wherefore it is generally held, that Angels, when
created, had also notions or species (which are objects) concreated with their
understanding; Ergo emanative actions are also transmutative.

All matter is transient: Wherefore the division of matter in transient and
immanent is erroneous. Transient matter is, out of which a being is constituted
by transmutation; so blood is the transient matter of flesh.

Immanent matter is, out of which a being is constituted without any
transmutation; as Wood is the immanent matter of a Ship. Here one part of the
division is referred to a Natural Production, the other to artificial. How is
this then a regular distribution, since its dividing Members ought to be of one
Species or kind? The same Improbation may be applied against the distribution
of matter in sensible and intelligible; which distinctions are accidental to
matter; and therefore may be justly omitted; for we ought to insert nothing in
a Science, but what does essentialy relate to its Subject: Hence Aristotle's
Precept is, in 1 B. of the Parts of Live. Creat. C. 3. (...), that we ought to
divide a being by them parts, which are contained in its essence, and not by
its Accidents.

The division of Matter in Metaphysical and Physical may be rejected upon the
same ground.

These divisions, as they are objective, appertain to Logic, where only second
notions are treated of, and are very useful to the directing of Reason.

VI. Forms are divisible in material and immaterial. If material is understood
to be that, which does inhere in matter (which is its most frequent and
ordinary acception; for most Philosophers take it in that sense) then all
worldly beings are material; what being is there, but which does inhere in
Matter? You may say, man's soul. The soul of man according to this acception, is
material. But if you take immaterial for that, which can or does exist out of
matter, then there are immaterial forms. Neither can this be naturally: for a
Natural Form is, which gives an actual specification and numerication to
matter: If so, how can a form give an actual Specification and numerication to
matter, when it is not united to it? I prove that the Form gives an actual
specification and numerication to matter. Forma dat esse (i. e. Specif. and
Numer.) non posse esse materiae. A Form gives a being, not a power of being to
Matter. For matter has the power of being from it self, and not from the Form.
This is true: for most Peripateticks hold, that Potentia is essential to
matter. The Soul of man, when once freed from its tie to the body; ceases to be
a Form; but therefore does not cease to continue a being. So that I conclude,
there are immaterial beings, but no immaterial Forms. It is ridiculous to
doubt, whether the Soul of man, when separated, has an Appetite or Inclination
to its Body, or to that matter, which it did once informate: because the soul
in its separated estate is a complete and perfect being, and does not need a
Body: neither is the Soul a Form in that state; Wherefore should it then have
an Appetite to its Body? Such an Appetite would be in vain. You may answer,
that it wants a Subject to inhere or subsist in. I grant it, and therefore it
subsisteth in God.

VII. A Form is improperly divided in an assistent and informating Form;
because one being is satisfied with one Form; for had it two forms, it would be
a double being. 2. That, which they intend by an assistent form, is coincident
with an Efficient Cause.

CHAP. XXIV. Of the Theorems of Causes.
1. That a Cause and its Effects are co-existent. 2. That there are but three
Causes of every Natural Being. 3. That there is but one Cause of every Being.
4. That all Beings are constituted by one or more Causes. 5. That all Causes
are really univocal. 6. That all Natural Causes act necessarily. 7. That the
Soul of a Beast acts necessarily. 8. That all Matter has a Form. That Matter
is capable of many Forms.


I. A Cause and its Effect are existent at one and the same time. This Theorem
is received among most Philosophers, who render it thus; Posita Causa, ponitur
Effectus. The Cause being stated, that is, reduced into action, its Effect is
also stated, or produced. The Reason depends upon their relation one to the
other, to whose Relata it is proper to exist at one and the same time,
according to that trite Maxim, Relata mutuo sese ponunt and tollunt. Relations
do constitute and abolish one another.

II. There are three Causes of every Natural Being, whereof one reduced to
Action supposes the others also to be reduced to action. The Proof of this is
demonstrated by the same Axiom, by which the next forementioned was inferred:

III. There is but one Cause of all Beings. A Cause here is taken in a strict
sense, for that, which produces an effect essentially and really distinct from
it self: In this Acception is an efficient the only cause of all Beings. Matter
and Form are no Causes, according to this Interpretation, but Principles;
because they do not constitute an effect essentially different from themselves.
A Cause sometime is taken in a strict sense, for that, which produces an
Effect different from it self modally; and so there are two; to wit, Matter and
Form. Lastly, A cause, as it signifies in a middle signification,
participating of each acception, comprehends a triplicity of causes; viz. An
Efficient, Matter, and Form.

IV. All beings are constituted by one or more Causes. God is of himself, and
not from any other, as from an efficient cause; and consists of one pure
formal cause. By formal Cause, understand an immaterial being. Angels are
constituted by two Causes; namely, by an Efficient and a Form. All other Beings
are constituted by more.

V. All Causes are univocal. This is to be understood of Efficients only.
Whatever Effect a Cause produces, it is like to its Form, and is formal only:
For it cannot generate matter, that being created. Wherefore it cannot produce
any thing else, but what like to it self, and consequently produces always
the same effect; whereas an equivocal cause should produce different effects.
You may demand, why it happens, that many effects are different, as we observe
in the Sun, which by its heat, does produce Vegetables and Animals, which are
different? I answer, that the Difference does result from the diversity of the
Matter, upon which it acts, and not from the causality; that being ever one
and the same. The diversity of Effects is accidental to the Efficient, and
therefore not to be allowed of in Sciences.

VI. All Natural Causes act Necessarily. Hence derives this Maxim; Natura
nunquam errat: Nature does never err; because she acts necessarily. Against
this Maxim may be objected, that Nature erreth in generating a Monster. This is
no Error of Nature: It might rather be imputed an Error, if, when it should
produce a Monster, it does not. That, which acts after the same manner at all
times, does not err; But Nature does act in the same manner at all times; Ergo
she does never err. I prove the Minor. If she acts differently at any time, it
is in a Monster: But she does not act differently in a Monster; as in the
example forenamed, of a Dog without Legs, she does through the Efficient cause
educe a form out of the matter, which she extends according to the extent of
the subjected matter; the matter therefore being deficient in quantity, it is
accidental to Nature, if thereby a being is not brought to the likeness of its
Species.

The Soul of man may be considered, either, 1. As a Natural Cause; and so it
acts also necessarily, in giving a Being and Life to the Body: For as long as
it abides in the body, it cannot, but give Life to its Parts. 2. As it is
above a Natural Cause, in that it has a power of acting voluntarily without
the Necessity or Impulse of Nature.

VII. The Soul of a Beast does act necessarily, and by Instinct of Nature. This
Conclusion may seem to contradict, what is set down in the precedent Paragraph;
containing, that to act necessarily, is to act always in the same manner:
whereas Beasts act in sundry manners, and produce various Effects: as,
sometimes they feed, other times they run, or lie down; which are all various
acts, and performed in various manners. These Acts are called spontaneous,
which generally are received as differing from Natural and Voluntary, and
constituting a Mean between Necessary and Contingent, although improperly; for
there is no Mean between Necessary and Contingent; because whatever is
Necessary, cannot be Contingent, and whatever is Contingent, cannot be
Necessary. These Acts must be either the one, or the other. They are not
contingent, for then a Beast, as a Beast, could not act necessarily. Since then
it is more evident, that they act necessarily at most times, it is an
invincible Argument, that they do not act contingently. This by the way; I
return to the forementioned Objection, and to reconciliate them seeming
Contradictions: I say, that, 1. Nature does act always in the same manner,
through the same Principles, and upon the same Object. 2. Nature does not act
always in the same manner, through different Principles, and upon different
Objects: For example; Opium raises fury in a Turk, and lays it in an
European: These are different Effects, because the Objects are different. Coral
is heavy and weighty from its Earth, and thence proves obstructive in the body
of man: Coral is also informated by a sublime spirit, through which it is
aperitive and cordial. The difference of these effects proceeds from the
difference of Principles. I apply this to the Acts of a Beast, which are
different, because they proceed from different Principles: Nevertheless them
Acts are always the same, as far as they proceed from the same Principles,
although different from one another. But as for a voluntary Principle, that
acts effects different from it self, as it is one and the same Principle.

The Proprieties of voluntary are,

1. To act different Effects through one and the same Principle. 2. To have a
power of suspending an Action. 3. To act with Election.
The Proprieties of Naturals are,

1. To act the same Acts through the same Principle. 2. To act always, and
withal necessarily, without having a power of suspending its Action. 3. To act
through an Impulse of Nature. A Brute does feed from an Instinct of Nature, and
therefore cannot but obey it, at the same Instant of that Instinct, provided
there be food for it to feed upon. Neither can it suspend that Action for a
moment, but as soon as it is impelled, it moves toward its food. This is
evident in a Dog; if he be very hungry, and have a bone in his sight, he will
move toward that bone, although you beat him never so much. A Brute moves
locally either to avoid pain, or to search for food. If a Beast move after it
is filled, it moves to avoid pain, (and in that it answers to the Impression
of Nature, whereby all natural beings move to avoid that, which is inconvenient
to them, or disagreeing with them) which it feels in lying long, through the
weight of his bones, one pressing the other, and therefore moves, to else
himself, either by standing, going, or running. He goes or runs so long
until he is pained by it; and then to ease himself, and to avoid that pain, he
lies down again.
VIII. All Matter has a Form: because it would be nothing, if it had no Form:
For from thence it is thought to receive unity; now without unity a being is no
being.

All Matter has but one essential Form; for had it two essential Forms, it
would be two Beings, and consequently no Being; because whatever is not one, or
is more then one, is no Being.

The Form gives Unity, and Distinction to the Matter.

Matter is capable of many Forms successively, that is one after another: as
for example; The Matter, which is in an Herb, is capable of receiving the form
of Chyle, of Blood, and of Flesh: Or if burnt, of Ashes; if then melted, of
Glass.

In like manner man receives first the form of a Plant, afterward of an
Animal or sensible Living Creature, lastly, of a Man.

A Form does act without intermission: For should its Action cease at any time,
at the same moment would the Form cease also with it.

THE DOCTRINE AND CONTROVERSIES Of POWER. The FIRST PART. The third Book.
The Doctrine and Controversies of Power. The Third Book.

CHAP. I. Of Powers, according to the Peripateticks.
1. The Opinion of the Peripateticks touching the Souls Action. That according
to the same Opinion, a Substance is said not to act immediately through it
self, but through superadded Powers. 2. That a Substance acts through as many
different Powers, as it produces different Acts. 3. That the said Powers are
really and formally distinct from the essence of the Soul. 4. That Powers are
concreated with the Soul, and do immediately emanate from her Essence. 5. That
immaterial Powers are inherent in the Soul, as in their Agent; Material ones in
the Matter, as in their Subject. 6. That Powers are distinguished by their Acts
and Objects. The Authors Intent in treating of the Faculties of the Soul.


IT is an universal Truth, That all Essences which have a Being, have it for an
Operation: Wherefore there is nothing idle within the Creation, but all its
parts from the Center of the Earth, to the Circumference of the Heavens, are
found to perform some Action or other without Intermission; which ceasing, the
essence, from whence it issued forth, cease with it: When fire and Water
cease from diffusion and concentration, then their being cease withal. Hence
it is evident, that the Soul of man, since it has a being, performs an
operation, or Action, the which, according to the sense of the Peripatetick
School, is impossible to be effected through the substance of the Soul; their
Reason being grounded upon that Dictate of their great Master, viz. No
substance acts immediately through it self, but by a superadded power. This
they do illustrate by this Instance; The Elements do not act through their
Substance or Form, but through their heat, coldness, etc. which are qualities
distinct from their Form and Substance. Hence does Aristotle conclude, 1. That
nothing is contrary to a Substance, but to its power and qualities: because a
substance cannot act through it self. 2. That no Substance can be affirmed to
be more or less a substance then another, that is, no substance can be either
remitted or intended: for example, one fire cannot be said to be more a fire,
then another, because it does cast a greater heat, which proceeds from its
stronger power, and heating quality, and not from its being more a fire then
another fire is: but one fire may be said to be hotter and greater then
another, which happens (as I hinted before) through the intention of its
quality, and access of quantity.

II. A Substance being adorned with that variety of Accidents, it is probable,
that Nature has bestowed them for Action (say they) and not for naught.

They do not only allow one power to a Substance, which might suffice, but a
multitude; yea, as many as there are varieties of acts, specifically differing
from one another, effected through a Substance. This leans upon an Argument
of theirs, thus framed: The Soul Aver. Met. 7. c. 3. Tho. A. p. 1. q. 77. 1.
Art. c. 1. Herv. qual. 1. q 9. Apol. de an. q 7.
being indifferent to diverse Acts, there must be something superadded, by which
it is determined to produce certain Acts. Neither is this Opinion deficient in
Authorities of Learned Philosophers, Averrhoes, Thomas Aq. Albertus magn.
Hervaeus, Apollinaris, and others consenting thereunto: Dionysius also in his
Book concerning divine Names teaches, that Celestial Spirits are divisible
into their Essence, Virtue or Power, and Operation.

III. The said powers are not only affixt to the Souls Essence, but are also
formally and really distinct from it. They are persuaded to a formal
distinction; because else we might justly be supposed to will, when we
understand, and to understand, when we will; or to tall, when we smell, and so
in all others. They are moved to a real distinction, by reason that all powers
in a Substance are really distinct from its Matter and Form. Weight and
Lightness, which are Powers inherent in the Elements, whereby they incline to
the Center, or decline from it, are not the Matter of Earth and Fire, nor their
forms, and therefore they are really distinct from their Essence.

IV. These Powers are concreated with the soul, and do immediately flow from
her Essence. An Argument whereby to prove this, is set down by Thom. Aq. among
his Quaest. Powers are accidentary Thom. p. 1. q. 77. Art. 6.
forms, or Accidents properly belonging to their Subject, and concreated with
it, giving it also a kind of a being: It is therefore necessary that they do
arise, as Concomitants of its Essence, from that, which gives a substantial
and first being to a Subject. Zabarel de Facult. an. Lib. 1. Cap. 4. shows
the dependence of the powers from the Soul to be, as from their efficient
cause, from which they do immediately flow, not by means of a transmutation, or
Physical Action, which is always produced by motion. Others add, that the Soul
in respect to its faculties, may be also counted a Material Cause, because it
contains her faculties in her self: and a final Cause, the faculties being
allotted to her, as to their End.

V. Immaterial Powers are inherent in the Soul as in their agent or fountain.
Material Faculties, as the Senses, Nourishing Faculty, and the like, are
inserted in the Matter; yet so far only, as it is animated: Hence does
Aristotle call the latter, Organical Powers, from their inherence in the Organs.

VI. Powers are distinguished through their Acts and Objects, to which they
tend, and by which they are moved to act. For example: Any thing that is
visible, moves the fight, and is its proper Object, which does distinguish it
from the other Senses and Powers, which are moved by other Objects. Thus far
extends the Doctrine of Aristotle touching Powers, which, although consisting
more in Subtilities, and Appearances, then Evidences and Realities,
notwithstanding I thought meet to expose to your view, since most Modern
Authors do persist in the same, and thence to take occasion to examine the
Contents thereof, in these brief subsequent Positions. By the way, I must
desire the Reader to remember, that the distinction of Powers from their
Subject, is commonly treated of in the Doctrine of the Soul, and solely applied
to it, there being not the least doubt made of it elsewhere: Wherefore I have
also proposed the same as appliable to the Soul, but nevertheless shall make
further enquiry into it, so far as it does concern all Matters in general.

CHAP. II. Of all the usual Acceptions of Power.
1. The Etymology of Power. The Synonima's of Power. 2. The various Acceptions
of Power. 3. What a Passive Natural Power, and a Supernatural Passive or
Obediential Power is. 4. Various Divisions of Power.


I. THe unfolding the name is an Introduction to the knowledge of the thing it
self: and therefore it will not be amiss to give you the Etymology of Power.
(...), Power, is derived from (...), I can, or have in my power: So Potentia
from Possum, signifying the same. Power in English has its original from
Pouvoir in French, noting the like, viz. to can or be able. Power, Virtue,
Might, Strength, and Faculty are Synonima's, or words of one Interpretation:
Thus of ^ntimes we make enquiry, what Virtue, Strength, Power, or Faculty has
such or such an Herb? that is, what can it effect?

II. The Acception of the word Power is very ambiguous. 1. Sometime it is
understood passively, for a disposition, whereby a Substance is apt to receive
the strength of an Agent. 2. Actively, for that, through which a being can act.
3. Its signification does vary much, according to the Subject, which it does
respect: as, when we say a being in power, that is, a being, which is not
actually, but yet may or can be. So likewise a Cause in power is, which does
not actually produce an effect, but which can produce one.

Zabarel remarketh a double Acception of Power. 1. Improperly it is taken for a
Power, which is joined to its Act: Thus we say of a man, who actually walks,
that he can walk. 2. Properly it is attributed only to a Power, which does
precede its Act: Thus we say a man is a Logician, when he can be one.

III. A Passive Power, as it is capable to receive a Natural Act, is called a
disposition: As it may receive a Supernatural Act, that is, an Act from a
Supernatural Cause, it is then named an Obediential Power. The Power which was
inherent in Lots Wife of receiving the Form of a Pillar of Salt, was an
Obediential Power.

IV. Again those Powers are either Natural, Violent, or Neutral. A Natural
Power is such, which is agreeable to its Nature; as the power in Fire of
ascending is Natural to it. A violent power is, which is disagreeing to the
Nature of its Subject; as, in fire, there is a violent Power of moving
downward. A Neutral power is, which is neither the one or the other, but
participates of both. Such is the power in fire of moving circularly.

A Power may be understood either for a Logical power, which is nothing else,
but a non-repugnance: or, for a Physical power, which is the same with a
Natural disposition: or, for a Moral Power, which is nothing else but the Will.
Lastly, in Metaphysics it is that, which is presupposed to be in an actus
entitativus.

There is also mention made in Philosophy, of an Objective Power, which is not
much different from a Non-repugnance, or a Logical Power, but expressly it is a
Possibility of existing in a being, which the understanding does give it before
its Existence.

Many more Additions of Power might be proffered: as, that a Power is either
Created or Increated; Accidental or Substantial; Essential or Modal; Material
or Formal, etc.

apprehended powers.


1. TO make a safe Inroad into this large Channel of Acceptions of Power,
without being misled through its Ambiguities, it is advisable to pitch upon a
single Mark, which we shall do, in stating a single Concept of Power, common to
all these. Power, as it is opposite to an Act, is whereby a being can be that
either in its Essence, or Accidents, which it is not. This is the first
Imposition, and immediate signification of Power, from which all the others are
deduced, and are so called, so far as they have a resemblance to this single
and immediate Concept of Power. A Being is pronounced to be in power, in that
it can be that, which it is not: so active power is conceived to be a Power,
because it can act that, which it does not act, etc.

I said Essence, whereby I denote a substantial power; by Accidents, I intend a
power befalling either to Quantity, Quality, Relation, etc. For in all these
there may a Like power be discovered.

II. The first Doubt, which we must sound into, is, whether there is really or
ab extra, and a part rei, such a power as was beforementioned. This is a
Scruple, which possibly at first sight may seem ridiculous, especially to them,
who take it for a piece of Learning, to receive with an undoubted assent,
whatever is proposed by their Master. This supposed piece of Learning to me
rather seems a piece of Ignorance: for never to doubt, is never to know:
knowing is but a discerning truth from falsehood, and how can this be performed
without doubting? Doubting exposes truth and falsehood equally to our view.
Since then it is so, let no doubt seem ridiculous, for fear we become
ridiculous through not doubting. But to the matter in hand: we must repeat some
of our Principles. 1. That that is only real, which moves the understanding
from without. 2. That nothing moves the understanding from without, but what
is either an Essence, or Mode of an Essence. If then a power, whether of an
Essence or Accident, moves the understanding from without, it is to be
accounted real, if otherwise, it is to be thought a non ens reale. This
premised, I conclude,

1. A Power is not a Real Being, because a power does not move the
understanding from without. I confirm the Argument. Imagine your self to be
alone, it is possible that a Ghost may appear unto you in your Solitude. This
Possibility is the power of the Ghost its Existence, or apearance to you. Now I
demand from you, whether the power of a Ghost's Existence moves your
understanding before it does actually exist? You will Answer me, Yes; for you
know, that a Ghost can exist before it does exist. To the contrary, you cannot
imagine or know, that a particular Ghost can exist, before you have seen its
shape, figures, modes, or accidents; but after it has once appeared, then you
may imagine or know, that a Ghost can exist in the same form and shape, as it
did heretofore; and that but dubiously neither. Now what follows hence?
First, That a power does consecute a real being; for before you had seen that
particular Ghost, you could not imagine or know that it could exist. This makes
against the received Opinions of Philosophers, who say, that a Power does
precede all Acts. Here you may reply, that although you did not know the power
of a being, before you did perceive its actual existence through your sense,
yet this does not infer, but that, when you do apprehend a beings actuation,
you can think, that that being, which you perceive to be actuated, had a power
of being actuated, or how could it otherwise be actuated? So that your knowing
or not knowing does not cut off the real power, which does precede its Act: and
so you deny my supposition; to wit, that a being is real through its
cognoscibility from without. To rectify your Judgments in this Particular,
you are to observe, that it is not your particular knowing or not knowing of a
thing, makes it real, but it is the cognoscibility from without makes a thing
real, that is, its being in a capacity of moving man's understanding in general.

That body which is existent without the world, is it a real body or not?
Probably you say it is: I ask you then what kind of body it is? You tell me it
is an imaginary body, or that you do not know what body it is. If then it is an
imaginary body; ergo it is no real body. Again, it is not an imaginary body,
for you say it is an unknown body, How can you then imagine it? But supposing
you imagine Aristotle to be existent without the last Heaven; Aristotle
although existing there really, is but an Ens Rationis, or imaginary being as
to you, because he is not cognoscible to you from without, but only from
within. 2. He is cognoscible to be like to an actual real being; ergo he is no
more then an Ens Rationis.

In the same manner, why should an Ens in potentia be accounted to be more real
then Aristotle actually and really existing without the world? Wherefore a
being in power is no more then an Ens Rationis, and in no wise real.

If a being in power were real, real beings would be infinite; because beings
in power are indeterminated, and consequently must be infinite.

Lastly, I would willingly know wherein a being in power is distinguished from a
Non Ens, or nothing? A being in power has no Essence, neither is it definible,
unless considered as an actual real and cognoscible being. A poor man is a rich
man in Potentia, that is, he may be rich, but to may be rich, does include a
Non Ens, to wit, Poverty or no Riches. Besides, all beings act, but a being in
potentia does not act.

Power, denoting an actual Virtue and Principle of acting, is proper and
adhering to all beings. A Power in this sense is Synonimous to actual Strength
and Force, or is an actual disposition, through which a being does operate, and
produce effects. It is the same with the first Acception of Zabarel. In this
sense are the Forms of the Elements said to be Powers, which without doubt are
actual. Nutritive and vital Powers are actual Virtues of nourishing and
cherishing life. Obediential powers are actual dispositions, whereby beings are
capable of receiving new forms from God, at ove or beyond their natural forms.
That all Natural Powers are and must be actual, this ordinary Saying does
plainly infer; (...). All things, that are made by Nature or Art, must be made
from that which is Actual, that is, in Actu.

Against this may be Objected, That the power of seeing remains in a man, who
is asleep, although he does not actually see. I Answer, That that power is as
much actual from within as it was before, but its Acts depending upon Objective
Motions from without, are secluded by the intervent of the Eyelids, or
retraction and incrassation of the Optic Air: In the same manner a Candle
actually burning in a dark Lanthorn, is not abolisht in its enlightening power,
by the being shut in, upon which a darkness ensues; for the Candle burns
actually still. The Stomach is not deprived of its actual concocting power in
not seeming to concoct in the defect of Victuals, for the same Principle is
stirring still in the Stomach, although there is no external Object to work
upon. Wherefore Scaliger, Exerc. 325. d. 4. says well, Non enim tollitur
potentia per Objecti ablationem, quia fluit ab internis Principiis
essentialibus. For a Power is not removed by the removing of the Object,
because it flows from internal essential Principles.

To assert, that a Power although Actual, is the Cause of an Act, and not the
Essence wherein this Power is inherent, may justly be disgusted by any Natural
Philosopher, who collects his Knowledge of mixed bodies by means of his Senses,
and apprehends its Affections and Properties together with the body it self,
and not as if they were really distinct from it: Although in Metaphysics a
distinctio Rationis, or a distinction of the mind is allowable, by which the
Notions of Partial beings are totally abstracted from one another, and from
their Essence: but in Physics it is so absurd and perilous, that the assent
thereunto has missed many Physicians into a Labyrinth of Errors, which have
proved very fatal and ominous to their unhappy Patients. In an ardent Fever,
where a great Heat and Inflammation broiles the tormented body of the Decumbent,
a Peripatetick AEsculapius argues thus with himself: this is not the fire
kindled within the Nutritive or Vital Vessels, but its power, quality, and heat
inherent in that fire: whence he is persuaded to prescribe a whole Kinderken of
Ptysan and Juleps, to subdue this heat, imagining all this while, that the heat
and fire are two really distinct things, omitting in the mean time such helps,
which might remove the burning or flaming Essence, by substracting the entire
body of fire; which done, the heat is also removed with it; which may be
performed by Evacuations, as Phlebotomy and Purges.

From this same Tenent spreads another, no less erroneous, concerning Humors:
Humores peccant vel Substantia, Quantitate, vel Qualitate. Humors (say they)
become vicious either in their Substance, Quantity or Quality. Humors become
vicious in their Substance, when they variate (tota substantia) in or through
their whole substance from themselves: as, in the Plague, where the blood is
changed throughout its whole substance, and become venomous, which is, when it
does in a small quantity and short time extinguish our vital Flame. Now,
whether to extinguish our natural heat, does not proceed from a power inherent
in that venomous Blood, let them confess: How then according to their own
Maxims can Blood be vicious in its substance, no substance acting immediately
through it self; for blood (sanguis dicitur vitiosus, quia labem partibus
inurit) is said to be vicious, when it acts by injuring the parts. It remains
then, that humors according to their own Principles, cannot be vicious in their
substances, but powers or qualities.

2. Humors are pronounced to be peccant, when they do through their abundance
wrong the Parts in their Functions. This is contradictory to their own received
Doctrine: For whereas Quantity being an Affection and Passion of Matter, can be
in no wise active, because nothing (as they say) is contrary to it. How then
can it act, since all Action is affirmed to tend to its contrary, according to
this Maxim: Nihil agit in Simile. Nothing can act upon its Like.

3. It remains, that Humors must only be peccant in their quality. Not so
neither; for then we should only have need of alterative Medicines, and
Evacuations would seem to be in vain. What numerous Absurdities do scatter from
this Spring of Falsehood? A part of Democritus, and Ana of Heraclitus his
Philosophy, and of Socrates his Dictates ad pondus omnium, would make a better
Misce for a Recipe to introduce us unto a sound Doctrine of Physic. From all
which, I Argue, That Powers are neither really or formally distinct from their
Subject; and to avoid these forementioned Absurdities, I state that,

1. All Substances act through themselves, so far as they have a power of
Acting.

2. All Powers are really Identificated with their Subject.

3. Powers may be distinguished from their Subject modally, and through
operation of the mind.

4. Powers are intended and remitted through the access and detraction of
Degrees of the same kind: and are facilated or retarded through Habits, or the
defect of them.

The first Proposal contains three Assertions: 1. That all substantial
Essences do (as they term them) act, which is evidenced through this Axiom, All
which is, is for to operate. 2. That all Substances, (or according to my
Metaph. Essences) act immediately through themselves. 3. That Substances act
through themselves, so far as they have a power of acting.

IV. That all Substances act immediately through themselves, popular Speeches
do testify: as, Fire burns, a Horse runs, etc. Certainly these Actions are
predicated of the Substance or Essence of Fire, or of a Horse; not of their
powers, as if they were really distinct from them; for then they should say,
the fires power burns, a horses faculty runs. These Predications would be
absurd. How can a Power (according to the vulgar Peripatetick Acception) be a
power, and yet be said to act (it would be a Contradiction) since that a Power,
whilst it does act, is no more a Power, but is changed into an Act; hence they
say, that a Power and an Act are privative Opposites, so that the one cannot be
Categorically predicated of the other. Here may be replied, that a Substance
acts through its power; wherefore it is not the power that acts, but the
Substance. To this I Answer, that it may be granted, that a Substance acts
through its power, but then it is not to be understood, so as if the Substance
acted through another thing, or being, which is superadded to its Essence, as
they do vulgarly conceive; but that a Substance acts through a Power, as one of
its Parts (for as I proved, a Power is a Mode of a Substance, or one of its
Parts) and therefore it is to be counted, as if it acted through it self
immediately, because the Act of the Part is attributed to the whole.

So they say, a Horse runs, because he runs by means of some of his Parts,
namely, his Legs; nevertheless it is attributed to the whole thing. But take it
how you will, that, which a Substance does effect through one or more of its
Parts, is effected immediately through it self, because its Part or Parts are
it self. Wherefore if a Substance acted through its power as a being really
distinct from it self, these Inconveniences would necessarily ensue.

1. That a being should exist without an Operation; for if a Substance did not
act through it self, but only through its superadded power, then it self must
exist without an Operation, which thwarts that Maxim, Omne quodest, est propter
Operationem.

2. Substances would be censured less noble then their Accidents; for that
which acts, is more noble then that which acts not.

3. An Accident then would be supposed to be the Efficient of a Substance,
which contradicts another Maxim, Qualis Causa, talis Effectus. Such as the
Cause is, such is its Effect.

4. It supposes, that a Substance should be generated for an Accident, and not
an Accident for a Substance; for since that all beings are for an Operation, it
remains, that its Operation can be nothing else, but to be a Subject to an
Accident.

5. Accidents are said to be superadded to a Substance; Ergo according to their
Philosophy, its power was also superadded. The antecedence and consequence are
false. I prove the falsity of the Antecedence, which supposes, that a Substance
is a Substance without Accidents; and therefore they say, that Accidents are
superadded. I show the contrary, granting their Supposition, that Accidents are
superadded, there must necessarily be accidents, to wit, powers, allowed to
Substances, before the superaddition of other Accidents is possible: For
accidents cannot be superadded, unless a substance had a power of receiving
those Accidents; but that power is an accident; ergo a substance is not
imaginable without an accident. Hence it is, that Aristotle was forced to grant
a coeval power to his Materia prima. Or lastly, thus; If a Substance acted
through its power; ergo that Power must be either an Efficient, or instrumental
Cause, or a Causa sine qua non of its acts. It is irrational to state it an
Efficient, because then a Power produces a Nobler thing then it self, and an
Effect different from it in Specie. It cannot be appropriated to an
Instrumental, because it does not differ really and specifically from the
principal Cause; besides, an Instrumental cause is moved from its principal,
but a substance (as they say) does not move. Suppose I grant it to be a Causa
sine qua non, then it cannot be capable of producing an univocal Effect.

V. A Peripatetick power is a Non Ens Physicum; for it has neither Matter or
Form, and therefore cannot act physically. Hence it is shifted off to an Ens
Metaphysicum, and so they say, it has an Actus Entitativus: a plain
Contradiction, What, can a Potentia be an Actus?

Aristotle teaches, that a Power does always precede its act; which I prove to
be false. The Elements acted at the same moment, when they were created; Fire
was actually light, Earth weighty, etc. Possibly you reply, that their Power
was obediential to God; that is improper, for there could be no obediential, or
any other Entitative Power without a Substance, or a Subject, wherein it should
in here.

A substance does act so far as it has a power of acting. By Power understand
an actual virtue, or an internal and modal Principle of a Being or Essence,
from which its acts do flow. This Principle is a derived and congenited
disposition and limitation of a being to action, or is a being termined and
disposed to act such and such acts; for otherwise it would be indifferent to
all acts. This limitation causes every being to act within its own Sphere,
beyond which it cannot naturally excur to act any acts dissentaneous and
improportionate to its Nature.

The forementioned disposition is the same, which in Physics is nominated the
Form and Activity of a being, and is nothing else, but a certain Temperament
and proportionated mixture of the Elements in a Substance, the predominance of
which does dispose the body, constituted by their Congress, to determinated
acts. But of this more at large in my Physics.

VI. All Powers are really identificated with their Subject. A Power (as I
showed before) is that, whereby a Substance is disposed and determined to
certain acts, and is nothing but the Form exalted to a certain degree. I shall
make it plain by this Example of Wine or Brandy, either having a power of
heating the body, as the Sectarists of Ceres and Bacchus witness, by drinking
small Beer after a Deb^uch. That, which effects their heat, is the fiery parts
predominating over the others, which predominance is the power disposed to that
certain act. Is then fire predominating through its Access of Parts over the
other constituting Elements really distinct from it self, because it is greater?

2. The power of moving a Leg or Arm is inherent in the Spirits disposed and
determined to motion: Are these Spirits, when they do not move (for then they
are counted a power of motion) really distinct from themselves, when they do
move?

You may object: If Substances act through themselves, then alterative
Medicines are exhibited in vain. A Mistake; For although I assert, that a
Substance acts through it self, I do not deny, but that it alterates, moves
locally, or produces all other acts immediately through it self.

VII. Powers are distinguished from their Subject modally and by operation of
the Mind. A power may be taken in a double sense, either in the concrete or
abstract.

1. If in the concrete, then it is no longer to be called a Power of a being,
but a powerful being; it proving impossible to apprehend the one without the
other, unless with intention to make a Chimara of it; for if you consider them
apart, to wit, a Being, and Powerful, each by themselves, you must needs
imagine an Accident denoting extrinsecally, and from its first Imposition, an
actual qualification of its Subject, not to denote an actual qualification, and
consequently That is. a part actus.
that a concrete accident is not concrete, Powerful is not powerful, and that a
being is not it self.

2. In perceiving powerful separated from its being, you do apprehend power in
the Abstract (which I grant to be possible) but not powerful in the concrete,
which is repugnant; so that in considering Powerful in the Abstract you do
absurdly confound it with Power in the Abstract.

VIII. Power conceived in the Abstract is taken for an universal Entity,
abstracted by the Operation of the Mind from its Singulars, and in this
acception it is in no manner of a Physical, but of a pure Metaphysical
Consideration.

Metaphysical here I understand in the same Meaning, as it was intended in by
Aristotle.

The same Philosopher defines Heat, Cold, Moisture, and Dryness, by first
qualities, not first Powers, because (according to his doctrine) they were
actually inherent in the Elements at the instant of their Production; for power
with him, presupposes a non existence of the act thence flowing.

Wherefore it is apparent, that powers in the concrete are not distinguished
from their Substance either really, formally That is, by a formal reality, or
such, as any other operation of the mind might adjudge to be formally real, or
to respond from without to that distinct formality, which it conceives from
within.
, or by any other Operation of the mind: but if by any at all, it is ratione
rationante, quae absque ullo fit fundamento.

Powers in the abstract are distinguished from powers in the Concrete, in that
they offer a common Mode and manner of qualifying, and accidentally specifying
their Subject in the Concrete, to the Understanding, which occasioneth a Modal
Distinction.

Philosophers not daring to desert the Principles of Arist. and yet finding,
that Natural Substances act through themselves, and not through powers really
distinct from them, are constrained to assert, that a Substance acts and is
either through or in actu signato, (which had they rendered it otherwise, to
wit, that a Substance is and acts through a power, it would have been a
Contradiction; for to act, and to be in actu signato, are opposite to being in
potentia, and to act through a potentia) or in actu exercito.

IX. Powers are remitted and intended by subduction and addition of parts of
the same nature, as it is evident in Canary wine, which is hotter then Rhenish,
because it contains more dense and united fiery Spirits. One fire is hotter
then another, because its similar parts are augmented by Access of Parts of the
same Nature.

That Powers are facilitated and slowed, through Habits and Defects of them, is
demonstrated elsewhere.

X. One similar Substance acts but one Formal Act (per se) through it self; and
(per accidens) by accident, that is, through means of extrinsick Causes, many.
The first part of this Theorem is proved by this Maxim. Una numero efficiens
producit unum tantum numero effectum. One and the same Efficient can produce
but one and the same Effect at one and the same time, and in one and the same
manner. But a similar substance is but one Efficient: Ergo it can produce but
one and the same Effect, etc. The Major is undeniable. I confirm the Assumtion.
A substance is effective through its form, which being but one, must also
determinate its Efficiency to one.

2. Fire is a substance: but fire has but one power (per se) Ergo. I prove the
Minor. That whereby the fire does act, is its penetrable lightness; but that is
single in fire; Ergo.

You may Object, That its heating, burning, and locomotive powers are more then
one. To this I Answer, That the similar parts of fire exercises but one power
naturally and in its natural place, but if extrinsecally (that is, by an
Efficient from without) united and condensed, it becomes of a burning Nature.
Pray take the pains to peruse my Positions of fire in my Natural Phil. They
are satisfactory to all Objections. As for its locomotive Faculty, it is the
same with its rare lightness.

A Second Objection may be; Mercury is a similar substance: but Mercury has
several powers of heating, cooling, fluxing, killing the Worms, etc. It Is true,
the Effects are various, nevertheless the power, from whence they descend, is
but one, which unity seems to be multiplied materially, that is, through the
variety of its Objects. Mercury cooles in laxe and weak bodies, because through
its thickness and density it expels the loose heat of the said laxe bodies. It
heats in hot, strong, close bodies, because it is retained in such bodies, and
being retained, its parts are opened by the strong heat of the said bodies,
whereby the fiery hot spirits break forth, and unite themselves with the heat
of such bodies, and so it becomes hotter. In like manner Fluxing and its other
Effects are wrought all through one power, their difference happening from the
difference of the Object.

Obj. 3. If every similar substance obtaines one power of acting, then in every
dissimilar or mixed body there should be four powers, because it consists of
four similar substances. I Answer, That the Elements, when mixed, limit their
power within one temperament, and one formal power.

The latter part of this Theorem is, That a substance obtains many powers
(per accidens h. e. in statu violento, eadem quidem a principio, formali, sed
(...) agente, nec non a causa efficienti ab extra impulsa, plane quod rei
naturae contrariatur) by accident, that is when a substance is seated in a
violent state, and although acting from its formal Principle, yet it is against
its first Nature, as being opposed by an External Efficient.

XI. An Organical and dissimilar substance exercises naturally as many formal
powers, as it contains similar substances in it self, really different from
one another; and but one formal power, so far as these similar substances tend
to the constituting of one formal substance. All similar substances contained
within the Sphere of an Organical substance tend naturally (e naturae quadam
necessitate) and from a certain necessity of Nature (for they could not exist
separately, because then they would be imperfect) to its Constitution. A hand
is an Organical substance: In a hand are comprehended,

1. A Locomotive power,

2. A sensitive power.

3. A Nutritive Faculty. These various powers depend from the variety of
similar (scilicet ad sensum) parts, to wit, the first from Nerves; the second
the Membranes; the third from the vital heat: notwithstanding all of them
constitute but one formal locomotive, sensitive, and vegetative power.

Actus and Potentia in the Concrete are really identificated; for Potentia
denotes an actual virtue and power in a substance. This may be called actus
activus, and so Anima is defined Actus by Arist. 2. It imports Action. 3. It
sometime implies an Effect, otherwise called Actus passivus. It is an Actus,
because it does act through a power, which it had from its first act, a
different Effect. It is Passivus, because it receives its power from that first
Actus. Wherefore you must take notice, that it is not termed Actus passivus
secundum Idem ad Idem, for that would imply a Contradiction.

XII. From this Discourse we may easily be resolved in these Doubts.

1. Whether it be not repugnant, that any Accidental or Substantial Power
should be superadded to its Subject? Aff.

2. Whether the volitive power in the Concrete be really and formally
identificated with the Soul? Aff.

3. Whether the Soul acts immediately through her self, and not through super
added powers? Aff.

4. Whether the augmentative power be really and formally distinct from the
Nutritive power, and the Nutritive from the Generative Power? There is a modal
distinction, or a part rei a Material one, but none Real.

XIII. Besides all this, there is an Absolute Power conferred upon Gods
Creatures in general, and upon man in particular. I do not mean Absolute
Simpliciter; for that were Repugnant, as I have proved in my Theol. but
secundam quid. I will further explain it to you.

The Power, which all Creatures have of being and acting at that present
Moment, wherein they enjoy their being, and do act, is absolute, because they
cannot but enjoy that same being, and act at that Moment, wherein they have a
Being, and do act, Ergo it is Absolute: but not simpliciter, for were it so,
then they would obtain that absolute power of being from and out of their own
Nature, which we know is dependent from Gods Power; and according to this sense
none consists of an absolute power, but God alone, because his Nature is
alone independent. It is then absolute secundum quid, because God has ordained
that, which is, to be, and that, which ever has been, to have been, and that
which shall be, to come to pass. In short, Absolute secundum quid, I take for
that, which is unchangeable, as all beings and their Actions are in that sense,
as I have proposed. They are unchangeable, because Gods Ordination in Creating,
Giving, Forbearing, and in all other Particulars, is unchangeable.

This Distinction is of that use, that many Points in Divinity cannot be
resolved, but by its being applied to them. I shall content my self with the
having named it, since I have Treated of it at large in another Part of my
Philosophy.

XIV. The Absolute (secundum quid) powers, which God has conferred upon his
Creatures, are by Physicians otherwise termed Faculties; (Facultates) which are
derived from (a faciendo) doing, that is, they are actual dispositions, whereby
Effects are done. Hence Galen, Lib. 1. de Nature. Facult. Par. 3. Prima euim
actionis ipsius potentia causa est. The first cause of an Action (says he) is
the power. And in another place of the same Book, he renders himself thus:
Facultatum quatuor naturalium essentia in partium singularum nutriendarum
temperie est: that is, The Essence of the four Natural Faculties consists in
the temperament of the parts, that are to be nourished: which is nothing
different, then if he had said, the Faculties, (Facultates sunt temperamenta
facientia) are temperaments actually doing effects. Now it is evident, that
Galen held the Temperament of bodies to be their Forms, which if so, then
questionless, his Opinion tended to assert, that Powers and their Subjects were
really identificated, and that all powers were actual. Moreover we shall find
throughout all his Tomes, that his sense touching powers and Faculties does e
Diametro agree with what I have set down in this present Treatise. As for
Hippocrates, I cannot read a word throughout all his works, but what tends
against Aristotle in every Particular, forasmuch as it relate; to our Subject.

In the Conclusion, I must remember you to observe, that many Terms, as,
Formal, Substance, Accident, and diverse others, I have sometimes made use of in
the same sense, as I have proposed them in the Foregoing Chapters, other times
I have intended them in the same Acception which Philosophers vulgarly receive
them in; But herein the Sense of the Matter will easily direct you.

RELIGIO PHILOSOPHI, OR Natural Theology. The FIRST PART. The fourth Book.

By Gedeon Harvey Doctor of Physic and Philosophy.

LONDON, Printed by A. M. for Samuel Thomson at the Sign of the Bishops-head in
St Paul's Churchyard. 1663.

TO HIS Most Honored Mother ELIZABETH HARVEY.
Dear Mother,
AMong those serious Admonitions, which from your singular Affection and Care,
you have so often repeated to me, This I remember has been one of the most
earnest of them, that above all I should mind things of Eternity, such as alone
can make me eternally Happy. Herein I cannot but acknowledge your greatest
Love, tending to invest me with the greatest Happiness, returning you all
thanks, that so great a Benefit is worthy of. Moreover to show my entire
Obedience to so important a Command, I have here drawn up a few Heads touching
the Greatest Happiness, and the Means whereby to procure it, which I do with
all humility present unto you, as a Debt due to your self, in regard I have
extracted the principal Rules from the Rudiments, which your constant Practice
and wholesome Precepts had in my younger years infused in me. The cause and
object, which alone can afford us this infinite Happiness, is the Summum
Bonum, whereunto we are to direct all our aim; which that we may with success
attain unto, are the continual Prayers of

Your most affectionate and obedient Son Gedeon Harvey.

RELIGIO PHILOSOPHI, OR Natural Theology. The FIRST PART. The fourth Book.
CHAP. I. Of the Nature of Natural Theology.
1. What Theology is. 2. That Theosophy is a fitter name to signify the same,
which is here intended by Theology. That in knowing God we become Philosophers.
3. What a Habit is. 4. What it is to live happily. That there is a mean or
middle way of living, which is neither living in happiness, or living in
misery. 5. How Theology is divided. 6. What Natural Theology is. What
Supernatural Theology is. The first Doubts of a natural man. 7. The Dignity of
Theology.


I. THEOLOGY is a habit of enjoying the greatest Good, and living in the
greatest Happiness.

This practick Science might from the eminence and transcendence of its end and
object, crave a more excellent name: for Theology signifies only a discourse
of God, and expresses a Theoretick Science, and therefore is too strict to
adequate the whole and full concept of what is generally intended by Theology.
This name is fitter to be imposed upon the Doctrine of God, as he is
theoretically discoursed of in Pneamatology: The parts of which Doctrine might
be aptly denoted by Theology, Angelology and Psychelogy: whereas this noble
Science is better expressed by (...), or wisdom of God, because wisdom
comprehends an universal collection of all practick and theoretick Sciences;
all which we know by knowing God, and we know them to be in, and from God: For,
do we not know, that all natural Beings are in and from God? they are in God,
because God comprehends and conserveth them in, and by his Power. Is not God
the Pattern of our Actions? And do we not know that our actions are good or
evil, from knowing them to have some likeness to his Actions, or to be
altogether different from them? Do we not know our selves in knowing God?
wherefore without knowing God we know Nothing. In knowing God to be the first
Cause, and Creator of all natural Beings, we know Natural Philosophy, and
become Natural Philosophers. In discerning good from evil in our actions, by
comparing them to the most perfect actions of God, we attain to Moral
Philosophy: In knowing him to be the Being of Beings, we reach to the knowledge
of supernatural Philosophy or Metaphysics. This name does in a large sense
express Philosophy, and in a strict sense denotes Theology, as it is defined
here above. The wise Apostle James seems to impose this very name, in that
place of his Epistle Chap. 3. v. 17. and Chap. 1. v. 5.
, Wisdom that is from above, is, etc. What is wisdom from above, but the
wisdom of God?

II. The Genus of the Definition is a Habit, which is a rooted disposition,
whereby we are inclined to operate with ease. It is not the enjoyment of one
single happiness, which can make a man happy; for one act is transitory, and is
not at all durable: but it must be a rooted happiness, the possession of which
does make us happy for ever. Since we are to live for ever, we must either be
rooted in happiness, if we intend to be everlastingly happy, or else rooted in
evil, whereby we continue in misery without end.

III. The happiness which we reap from this Philosophy is not an ordinary
happiness, but it is a happiness in its highest degree and Perfection; or it
is a durable contentment accompanied with the greatest joy that is possible to
be enjoyed by us in this world. On the other side, the misery which attends the
habit of evil, is no less tormenting, dismal and doleful, than the other is
joyful.

IV. The Differentia of the Definition is, to possess the greatest good, and
to live in the greatest happiness. All Practick Sciences do operate for an
end, and therefore are to be defined by that End.

To live happily is to live in contentment and joy. There seems to be a Medium
between living in joy, and living in misery, which is to live for a Passe-time:
For there are many, who do all things for a Passe-time; they play at Cards,
Dice and Bowls; they discourse and all for a Passe-time: Some take Tobacco, and
drink themselves drunk for to pass away the time. Certainly these can neither
say, that they are affected with joy or misery, but seem to be in a neutral
state. Of these does Sallust justly give his opinion: Multi mortales dediti
ventri, at que somno, indocti, incultique vitam, sicut peregrinantes tranfiere.
Quibus profecto, contranaturam, corpus voluptati, anima oneri fuit. Eorum ego
vitam mortemque juxta aestumo: quoniam de utraque siletur. There are many men,
who being given to their gut, and to sleep, continuing unlearned and rude, have
passed away their days like unto Travelers. To whom indeed against nature
their body was a pleasure, and their soul a burden. These men's life and death I
judge alike; for there is no notice taken of either.

V. Theology is Natural or Supernatural.

VI. Natural Theology is a natural habit of possessing the greatest good, and
living in the greatest happiness, that a natural man may attain unto in this
world, and in the world to come.

Supernatural Theology is a supernatural habit of possessing the greatest good,
and living in the greatest happiness, that a man may supernaturally attain
unto in this material, and in the next spiritual world.

It is not my drift to treat of supernatural Theology in this volume; neither
do I pretend more in that, than a Christian Disciple, and not as a Teacher, to
which a special Call, and an extraordinary spiritual disposition must concur:
but my chief design and aim is rationally to demonstrate a Natural Theology;
such, which a man through his natural gifts of reason and understanding, may
reach unto, without an extraordinary concurrence of God with him.

The benefit which is hence expected, serves to convince those desperate and
carnal wretches from their affected Atheism; yet must be less affected with
it, than to be rooted and confirmed in it, In which, if otherwise they are,
Reasoning will not take any effect upon them. The first doubt or query, which a
natural man does, or may propose is, Whether it is possible for him to know
through his reasoning, if his soul be immortal: For says he, if my soul is
mortal, it will prove in vain to make further search after happiness, then is
or can be enjoyed in this world. The second scruple which a man (or rather the
Devil) does foolishly move to himself, is, Whether (the soul now being
demonstrated to him to be immortal) there is a God: For whence can he expect
any happiness after death, but from God? Thirdly, Whether it is possible to a
Natural man by his own power, and Gods ordinary assistance or concurrence, to
procure the possession of the twofold beforementioned Summum Bonum. But,
before I apply my self to the solving of these Doubts, I must explain what the
greatest happiness is, which I intend to perform briefly and clearly in the
next Chapter.

I need not add many words to the illustrating of the eminence and worth of
this Divine Science, since the name it self does speak it. The eloquence of
Cicero does thus set forth the dignity of wisdom in his 2. Offic. By the
immortal Gods what is there more to be desired than wisdom? what is better to
a man? what is more worthy of a man's knowledge? The same may be better applied
to the wisdom of God, that is, concerning God. God (says Austin) is wisdom
himself, through whom all things are made, and a true Philosopher is a lover of
God, in that he is a lover of wisdom. If we are ignorant of God, we are no
Philosophers, and through that ignorance we fall into great Errors. Lactantius
in his third Book, does express himself much to the same tenor, where
speaking of Philosophers, he says, It is true, they have sought for wisdom,
but because they did not search after it, as they should have done, they fell
further into such errors, that they were ignorant of common wisdom.

CHAP. II. Of the end of Natural Theology.
1. Wherein Moral Philosophy differs from Natural Theology; and wherein it
agrees with it. That the Heathen Philosophers were no true Philosophers.
Aristotle his dying words. Epicure his miserable Death, after so pleasant a
Life. 2. A Description of the greatest Happiness. Queries touching the
greatest Happiness. 3. Whether the greatest Happiness is the nearest and
principal end of Theology. 4. How the greatest Happiness is otherwise called.


1. ONe or other may object against our Definition of Natural Theology, that I
do confound it with Moral Philosophy. I answer, Moral Philosophy is taken in a
large sense for a habit of living in the greatest happiness here and
hereafter, and then it is synonimous to Natural Theology. Or in a strict sense;
for a habit of living in the greatest happiness only in this world: which may
be termed an Epicurean Moral Philosophy, and is such whose object vanishes
with the expiration of the soul out of the body. This last is grounded upon a
false maxim of its End; to wit, that the greatest happiness, which ^^^ be
enjoyed in this world, is essentially different from (...), which we may enjoy
hereafter. It is essentially different; because, according to their folly,
there is no happiness to be expected any where else, but where we are at
present.

The falsehood of this Theorem is evident: because that greatest happiness
which we enjoy in this world, is like (but in an inferious degree) to that,
which we expect in the other. Neither is any happiness to be paralleled to the
greatest, but which is a true Theologick happiness: If so, then a Theologick
happiness must be our Summum Bonum. No wonder therefore if Philosophers being
destitute of this Theologick habit were false Philosophers. This is the reason,
why Aristotle, and other supposed Philosophers, never arrived to the possession
of the greatest happiness; because they were ignorant of God. And is it not
therefore unworthy of a Philosopher to be a slave to their Dictates? which
affected slavery, has proved an obvious cause of the greatest errors in
Church and State. How full of Anguish, fear, jealousle, and uncertainties were
their souls through their not knowing the true God? They could never enjoy any
durable happiness, as long as their minds were perplexed with them doubts. In
what perplexity did Aristotle die? even when his languishing soul pressed out
these words: In doubts have I lived, and in more anguish do I die; whither I
shall go I know not; wherefore thou Being of Beings have mercy upon me. What
did the joys and pleasures of Epicure amount unto, when he was tormented with
such miserable pains of the strangury, as chased his soul out of his body?

II. The greatest happiness is, which of all things makes a man most happy.
Happiness is a concomitant of a joyful thing, or an effect wrought by a
joyful object upon man, the reception of which makes him truly happy. Here we
will first enquire, Whether the greatest happiness is the nearest End of
Natural Theology. 2. How it is otherwise called. 3. What it is. 4. Which is the
subject of this habit. 5. How it is to be procured.

In answer to the first: I say, that the greatest happiness is not the nearest
and principal end of Theology. I prove it: That which does not chiefly and
immediately move a man in Theology, is not the nearest and principal end: but
the greatest happiness does not chiefly and immediately move a man in
Theology: Therefore it is not the nearest and principal end of Theology.

2. It is the next end to the nearest, and an inseparable concomitant of the
nearest end: I prove it, That which we do enjoy next after the possession of
the habit of Natural Theology, and of the Summum Bonum, is the next end to the
nearest: But we do chiefly enjoy the greatest happiness next after the
possession of the habit of Theology, and of the Summum Bonum: Therefore it is
the next end to the nearest. There is none, which ever did possess the habit
of Theology, but confirms the truth and assurance of the Minor.

4. The greatest happiness is sometime called Summum Bonum, or the greatest
good from its causality; because it does through its presence confer the
greatest happiness upon that Subject, which it does irradiate. Hence Austin.
de Civ. Dei, lib. 8. cap. 3. Finis autem boni appellatur; quo quisque cum
pervenerit, beatus est. That is called the end of good, which makes every man
happy, that does attain to it. Note that the greatest happiness is only
tropically named Summum Bonum, from a Metonomia causae pro effectu.

CHAP. III. Of GOOD.
1. What Good is. 2. That Aristotle 's Definition of Good is erroneous. 3.
Diogenes his Definition of Good. 4. The Explanation of the Definition of Good.
How the several kinds of Good differ from one another. 5. What Moral Good is:
what moral evil is. 6. What Theologick Good and evil is.


BOnum, Good is that which does make the subject, which does possess it
perfect. Or Good: is that, which all Beings do incline unto, for to perfect
themselves. The highest and greatest Good must then be that which makes a man
most perfect and happy: or that which all men need to perfect themselves with
the same perfection, which man had, when he was first created. I said, need,
and not desire or incline into: because all men do not desire the Summum Bonum:
for all men do not come to the knowledge of it: yet all men need it for to
perfect themselves.

II. There are many definitions of Good spread among Philophers: whereof some
are false either in not adequating the whole definitum, or else in attributing
falsities by it to the definitum or subject defined. Among these that of
Aristotle is counted most authentic*: Good is that, which all things do
incline unto, or covet. This definition must either agree with Good, as it is
proper Lib. 1. cap. 1. Ethie.
to all Beings, and Transcendent: or as it is restricted to rationals and
animals, in which only there is an appetite and coveting: or as it is most
limited to rationals only. If we take it according to the first acception, the
definition is not formal, but only accidental: for it is accidental to beings
as they are Good, to be coveted or be desired from another being. Neither does
it hold true in the last acception: because we desire many things, which are
evil, and hurtful to us. To this may be answered, that a being, so far as it
is desired, is good, although it prove accidentally hurtful. This answer is
not satisfactory: for we do oftentimes desire things knowing them to be evil;
and therefore we do desire them as evil: for the will does covet things as they
are understood: if then the understanding does understand them to be evil, the
will must consequently will them as evil. Possibly some do reply, that the
understanding does conceive them very things, which a man afterward does
covet, To be good, otherwise he could not desire them: For, Did he desire them
as evil, then he would desire his own destruction, and be inferior to all
other creatures, which are only bent to that, which does perfect their nature:
or you may return your answer thus; that good is either apparent, or real and
truly good; and that the understanding does understand all beings to be good
apparently or really: or otherwise you may distinguish good, in good, which is
honest, or profitable and useful, or pleasant, and state that the
understanding does conceive all things either as they are honest, useful, or
pleasant. This does not remove all objections: as to the first; The will of man
is not restrained to a certain object as Naturals are, but is also extended to
contrary objects; to wit, to good and evil. Neither is it singly limited to
contradictories, as to will evil, and to leave it, because to desist from an
action is no action, and for that reason we cannot properly say, that the
actions of the will are free (quoad contradicentia tantum) only in willing evil
and ceasing from it. Secondly, Should God punish us for doing evil, when we
cannot act any thing but evil, it would appear somewhat severe: for punishment
is to punish a delict, and sin, in doing that, which we should not do, and
not doing that which we should do: if we should do a thing, it supposes we can
do it, otherwise it would seem absurd. No dispute, but we do and can will evil
as evil, and consequently the Definition is erroneous.

2. The second Solution does not clear the point, in supposing that the evil,
which we do will, we will it not as evil, but as apparent good. This is futil:
for what is apparent good, but a real evil? A thing must either be formally
evil, or formally good; betwixt these there can be no Medium.

The third is grounded upon a false distinction: because good, as it is good,
does not imply formally honesty, usefulness, or pleasure: neither is it
universally coveted by all bodies, as it is affected with any of these
accidents, but as it does perfect them. So that a pleasant good is frequently
not coveted, as a pleasant good, but as a pleasant evil, and we do know that
same pleasant evil to be so, before we do will it. The same may be said
concerning good, as it is useful. Nevertheless may good be also coveted
sometime, as it is pleasant, or useful, or honest, but these are only
accidental to good.

III. Diogenes the Stoic defines Good to be that, which is perfect in its own
nature. Herein he confounds perfection with good, which are formally different
one from the other, as I have showed in my Metaphysics. Besides Good is here
considered as it is relative, or related to another Being, although in
Metaphysics it is treated of, as absolute to a Being.

IV. Good is, whose end is to perfect that, which does bend to it, all Beings
bend to each other, because they perfect one another. By perfection understand
the further constitution and conservation of a Being; for all Beings are
further constituted and conserved by other Beings. This end may prove
frustraneous to many bodies, but that is not through the default of Good, but
of that Body, to which it proves frustraneous, although bent to it. Note, that
it does not follow, that all, which a Being is bent unto, is good for it,
although it follows, that all which does perfect a Being; is good. All Beings
are essentially bent to what is good, but accidentally they bend also to what
is evil. A depravate will is accidental to man, and therefore man does
accidentally covet evil. This evil although it is coveted accidentally by man,
yet by his will it is desired formally, and per se.

IV. There are several degrees of good, which do not differessentially from one
another, but have a resemblance and proportion one to the other; so that one
can become the other, or change into the nature of the other. According to
this, good is gradually distinguished into Moral Good, and Theologick Good.

V. Moral Good is, whose end is to perfectionate man, as he is in a natural
state.

Moral Evil is, whose end is to corrupt man, as he is in a natural state.

VI. Theologick Good is, which does perfectionate a man in a supernatural state.

Theologick Evil is, which does corrupt a man as he is in a preternatural state.

Of these I purpose to treat of distinctly in the next ensuing Chapter.

CHAP. IV. Of Moral Good, and Moral Evil.
1. An Explanation of the Definition of Moral Good. What is understood by a
Natural State. The ambiguity of the word Natural. 2. What Moral Good it is,
which does respect the Body. What Moral Good it is, which respects the Soul.
3. An Explanation of the Definition of Moral Evil. That God does not properly
bend to his creatures. 4. The Distinction between these two predicates, to be
Good, and to do Good. 5. How Moral Good turns to Moral Evil. 6. That Man, as he
is in a neutral state, is in a middle state, between supernatural and
preternatural.


FIrst, It is requisite to unfold the ambiguities of the terms contained in the
Definition of Moral Good. What it is to perfectionate I have already declared:
It remains to amplify, how man is understood to be in a Natural State. A
Natural Being is frequently taken for a Being, which is in the same state
wherein it was created or produced. A man then is said to be Natural, when he
is in the same state wherein he was created. There is a twofold Creation: 1.
There is an immediate Creation of man, whom God did create immediately through
himself, no other mediate effect being interposed. 2. A mediate Creation of man
is, whereby he is, mediately through his Parents, created by God. Man being
created by an immediate creation, as long as he continued in that nature and
state, wherein he was created, was natural: but having corrupted that state
through his appetite after Evil, he became counter-natural, in respect to his
former state.

A Natural Being is also understood for that, which continues in the same
state, wherein it is, as it is produced by a mediate creation; and in this
sense we are to apprehend it here. Here may be offered an Objection, That a
Being cannot be said to be created by a mediate Creation, and yet be
counter-natural. Pray observe me well here in this place: I say, that man, who
is created by a mediate Creation, is counter-natural; but I do not say that
God, who created him, did create him counter-natural: for he created him
Natural. Of this more at large elsewhere. And to return to my purpose: Man, as
he is natural according to the latter acception, does perfectionate himself by
that Moral Good, which he does bend unto, and that same moral Good does
conservate and further constitute a man in that nature, wherein he was created
by a mediate Creation. Man is sometimes taken disjunctly, for his body and
soul: or else jointly and integrally, as he does consist of both united.

II. According to the first distinction there is moral Good, which chiefly
concerns the Body of man: as meat, drink and clothes. There is also a moral
Good chiefly respecting the soul: as speculative and practick objects are
morally good to the soul. You may demand, how practick and speculative objects
do perfectionate the soul? I answer, That they by their objectivenesse do
conservate the souls action in its goodness; for had the soul no moral good
object to act upon, it would be without a moral good action, which is repugnant
to that Maxim, Omne quod est, est propter operationem. All which is, is for to
operate. In like manner do food and clothes conservate the Body of man in its
natural state.

III. Moral Evil does corrupt a man, as he is in a Natural state, and mak^^ him
counter-natural, that is, worse than he is in a Natural state. I am required
here to illustrate two obscurities: 1. How Moral Good can be said to be good.
2. How Moral Good turns to Moral Evil. In reference to the first, we are to
call to mind the definition of Good, which is, whose end is to perfect that,
which does bend to it. If then Moral Good obtains a virtue to perfect that,
which bends to it, it argues that it is good. You may reject my definition
of Good: because according to it, it follows, that God is conserved by his
creatures, since he is known to bend to them. In no wise, for God does not
properly bend to his creatures: because he is every where with them: But Gods
creatures may be properly said to bend to him: because bending does follow a
need; and want of conservation, which need being in all his creatures, but not
in God, they do bend to their Creator.

IV. To avoid falsities and errors in this nice point, it will not be amiss
for you, to observe a distinction between these two predicates: to be good, and
to do good. These are oftentimes confounded by many Divines, and so thereby
they fall into gross errors. To be good denotes a formality of good, as it does
concur to the further constitution of a Being by its modality. To do good is an
action whereby effects are produced from a good Being: Now these actions are
called good, because they proceed from a good Being; and not because they are
essentially good, and constitute an essential difference from its Being. So
that good actions are signs of goodness in a Being, and not the goodness it
self. To do good therefore is only to act from a good principle, and to give
signs of the goodness of a Being. This distinction proves very useful and
expedient to the discussing of the doubts touching Free Will. Annex to this
observation, that in a large sense Moral good is taken for good, as it is
defined above, and extends to other creatures than unto man only, for this
reason: because Moral good, as it is synonimous to a mean, and inferior good,
is become so to all, in being changed from the highest good, through the
deffecting of man from his highest good, to a mean or moral good. In a strict
sense, it is taken for the goodness of man in his actions, or manners only.

V. How does Moral Good turn to Moral Evil? This Question may be variously
understood: First, as good imports a natural good in the second acception,
and as it denotes a goodness in the Being, and not in its action: in this
sense moral good cannot change into moral evil, because nothing does corrupt it
self, I mean its own Being and Essence. If moral good is taken for a moral good
action, then it is coincident with a true action, which is such as God does
require from us, and is conformable to that action, in which God did create us:
I say in which: for all beings are created to be in action; and not through
which, because that specifieth Creation. According to this acception then are
morally good actions said to be such, as are true or conformable to their
Pattern. If these actions are false and difformable from their Pattern, then
they become evil. These actions do proceed from a free cause, and not
necessary; for then man could never have committed any evil. The freedom of
this causality consists in an indifferency to Good and Evil.

The state of man, wheren he is at present is neutral, that is, natural, which
is a state neither supernatural or preternatural. I prove it; A supernatural
state is, wherein man is most good, or consists of good in the highest
degree. A Preternatural state is, wherein a man is at the worst, or consists
of evil in the lowest degree: But a man in a natural state is neither most
good, nor worst in evil. Therefore he must needs be in a neutral state.

VI. Man, as he is in a natural state, is in a middle state, between
supernatural, and preter-natural. I prove, it is a property of a Middle or
Medium to participate of both extremes. But man in a natural state participates
of both the others, Ergo, He is in a middle state: I confirm the Minor. The
good which man does act is not the best good, neither is the evil, which man
acts the worst evil: for the Devils act worse. Ergo, It participateth
somewhat of good in the highest degree, and of evil in the worst. Or the
actions, which a natural man performs, are neither the worst or the best:
Therefore it participates of each. Another property of a natural or middle
state, is to have a disposition or capacity of becoming to be either of its
extremes. This I prove also to be in man, as he is in this present state. Many
natural men are glorified, and many are damned. Ergo, A natural man has a
disposition to either.

Moral Evil does corrupt a man, in that it partially destroys his perfection.

Moral Evil is either an Evil of the soul or body, or of both.

CHAP. V. Of Theologick Good, and Theologick Evil.
1. An Explanation of the Definition of Theologick Good. 2. An Explication of
the Definition of Theologick Evil. 3. What honest, useful and pleasant Good
is. 4. What Natural, Sensible and Moral Good is.


1. THeologick Good does perfectionate a man in a supernatural state only: For
a natural man as long as he does continue in a natural state, cannot be
theologically good, or do a good act, that is theologically good. A
supernatural state is, wherein a man is above his natural state, and is at his
greatest perfection.

II. Theologick Evil is directly contrary to Theologick Good, Neither is it
possible that both these should be in one subject, there being no greater
contraries, than Theologick Good, and Theologick Evil. They are most remote
from one another: so that there is an infinite proportion of distance between
them.

Theologick Evil does make a man worst; he cannot be worse, than when he is
theologically evil; neither is there then any capacity or disposition remaining
in him, whereby he may be changed into Good: So likewise a man, who is
Theologically Good, has no disposition to Theologick Evil.

Theologick Good implies a triple Good: 1. It imports a Theological good
cause, or which does make a man perfect in a supernatural state; and so God is
the only Theologick Good. Luc. 8. None is good but God alone
2. It is taken for a Being which is theologically Good, or for a Being which
is at its greatest perfection; and so may man in his entire state be termed
Theologically Good. 3. It may be understood for an action, which is
Theologically Good, that is true and conformable to its pattern, and of this
Good is man also capable in a supernatural state.

The Theologick Good which is in God is called Good through it self, or Bonum
per se. This Bonum is otherwise called Summum Bonum objectivum, or Beatitudo
objectiva: But the joy which we receive from that objective happiness, is
called Beatitudo formalis. The Theologick Good, which was in all his creatures,
is a Derivative Good, or Bonum per participationem.

The Peripateticks divide Good in that, which is honest, useful and pleasant.

Honest Good (Bonum bonestum) is, which is agreeable to Right Reason; and
therefore they say, it is Desirable through it self.

2. Useful Good is that, which is desired for its usefulness and convenience.
Pleasant Good is, which is coveted for its pleasure and delight, which it
affords. These two are not to be desired for their own sake, but for their
covenience and pleasure, which do accompany them. This Division is erroneous
upon a double account, 1. Because Good does not formally include in its formal
concept any delight, usefulness or honesty, but only a perfectionation. 2.
The dividing members cannot be equally attributed to all the kinds of good, and
therefore the distribution is illegitimate.

IV. Good, according to the subject, wherein it is inherent, or according the
appetite, through which it is coveted, is either Natural, Sensible or Moral.
Natural Good is, which is coveted from a natural Being. The appetite, through
which natural Beings do covet Good, is commonly called a natural Propensity or
Inclination. Sensible Good is, which is coveted by living creatures. Their
appetite is called a sensitive appetite. Moral Good is, which is coveted by
man. His appetite is otherwise known by the word Will.

Before I conclude this Chapter, I must entreat you to remember and take notice
of the several acceptions and distinct significations of Natural, Supernatural,
Counter-natural, Preter-natural, of Good, Moral Good, and Theologick Good. For
you are to interpret their significations variously, otherwise you will much
mistake my meaning.

CHAP. VI. Of the greatest and highest Good.
1. A further illustration of the greatest Good. 2. That the highest Good is
the nearest end of Natural Theology. 3. What the Summum Bonum is otherwise
called. That the greatest Good is our last end. 4. The inexpressible Joy, which
the soul obtains in possessing the greatest Good. 5. Two great benefits, which
the soul receives from the Summum Bonum.


I. IT was necessary for you first to know, what Good was in General, before
you could conceive what the highest Good is. So then, having laid down the
Doctrine of Good in short, it now remains to open to you, what the greatest
Good is.

The greatest Good is that, which does make us most perfect, and that is God
alone. I prove it; There is nothing can perfectionate usmost, but God alone:
Wherefore he is the only Summum Bonum.

II. The highest Good is the nearest end of Natural Theology. I prove it. That
which we do immediately and nearest incline unto and covet, is the nearest end:
But we do immediately and nearest covet and incline unto the Summum Bonum:
Wherefore the Summum Bonum is the nearest end. I confirm the Minor We do
immediately covet that, which does perfectionate us, because it is out of
necessity. The necessity appears in this; in that we must live to God; for
without him we cannot live or exist, and consequently we cannot be
perfectionated without him. Now that which is most necessary, must precede
that, which is less necessary; for it is possible for us to live without
happiness, and only to enjoy our being, if God had so pleased. And therefore
happiness is not absolutely necessary, but is superadded to this our appetite
merely from Gods bounty. We ought first to bend and incline to God; because he
is our Summum Bonum, and does perfectionate us; and not only, because he does
make us happy. In this bending to God; we answer to our end, and are true
beings. The same is also witnessed by Scripture, Prove. 16. God has made all
things for himself.

III. Summum Bonum is otherwise called our last End, because it is that, in
which all our good Actions seem to terminate: I prove that the greatest Good
and happiness is our last End. All Trades and Professions tend to make
provision for man's life. This provision, as meat and drink, etc. serves to
keep the Body in repair, that so it may continue a convenient mansion for the
Soul, and serve her through its organs. The prime organs are the inward and
outward Senses, which are subservient to the Soul, in advertising her of all
things, which may be prejudicial to man; and in pleasing her by conveying the
objects of all external beings to her; and commending them to her
Contemplation, which does chiefly consist in the discovery of the causes of all
things. The Soul, being now brought and seated in the midst of her
speculations, does not come to any rest or satisfaction there, but still makes
way, and passes through them, until she arrives to the last object, and its
last end, which is the farthest she can dyve. This last object is God, because
he is the last end of our contemplations; for beyond him we cannot conceive, or
think any thing. It is also certain, that all beings have their end, and are
terminated by it. This does infer, that the actions of man must also have their
end: The principal actions of man are them of the Soul; to wit, his
understanding. The understanding is not terminated by any material substance:
for it can think and understand beyond it: neither are created immaterial
substances objects, beyond which the Soul of man cannot imagine: for it does
imagine, know, and understand God: but beyond God it can imagine nothing.

All Beings have their causes, them causes have other causes, these other
causes at last must owe their being to one first Cause: otherwise causes would
be infinite, which is repugnant. Wherefore we cannot think beyond the first
Cause.

IV. The Soul having sublimed her self into a most sublime thought of God,
there she rests, and admireth his great power in giving a Being to all
sublunary and superlunary things. She admireth his wisdom and providence in
preserving them all. She is astonished at his infinite love toward mankind, in
Breathing his Essence out of his own breast. The joy and acquiessence which the
Soul finds in the contemplation of this last End and first Cause, is so
great, and unexpressible, that there is nothing in this vast World to resemble
it unto, but to it self.

Thus I have demonstrated how all the Actions of man tend to one last End, and
Summum Bonum.

V. From the Greatest Good, we receive two benefits: First, it makes us most
perfect and most happy: Secondly, it terminates our faculties; for in all other
Things we can find no rest, but in the Summum Bonum only. All other things can
give us no rest, because they are ordained for a further end, and subject to
changes and alterations every moment; but the Summum Bonum is the same for ever
and ever.

As for the happiness which does redound from the possession of the Summum
Bonum, it is a Joy and contentment beyond expression. None is capable of
conceiving what it is, except they who are the possessors of it. The joy is
such, that if a man happens to it, and is confirmed in it, he can never desert
it: a moments want of it, would seem to be the greatest misery.

CHAP. VII. Of the false Summum Bonum.
1. The Summum Bonum of the Epicureans unfolded and rejected. 2. That Wealth is
a greater torment than a Summum Bonum. The Riches of Seneca. That we ought to
follow his example. 3. That to be taken up in merry discourses is not the
greatest happiness. 4. That it is not the greatest happiness to be merry twice
or thrice a week at a man's country house. 5. That honor is not the greatest
good. 6. That swearing is no happiness. 7. The Author's ground why he was
compelled to make use of so light a style in this Chapter. 8. That all these
enumerated instances are highly to be embraced as good, but not as the greatest
Good. That meat and drink are to be taken with temperance. 9. That Riches are
not absolutely to be rejected. 10. That mutual converse is commendable. 11.
That a constant society is necessary to man. 12. That we ought to give honor
to whom honor is due. 13. That we ought not to refuse an Oath tendered by the
Magistrate.


THe Error and mistake of the Epicureans, cannot but startle any one, who is
but irradiated with the least glimpse of the Summum Bonum. They do foolishly
conceit that the greatest good and happiness consists in Pleasures, that are
taken by these two external senses; of tasting, and of the tact: which
pleasures primarily are gluttony, and its companion. What are these pleasures
but momentany? the enjoyment of them makes a man more restless, than he was
before: A gluttons stomach is no sooner filled; but his pleasures are past and
vanished: his next wish is; that his stomach were empty again, for to enjoy new
pleasures. This vice is endemick to some people, whose custom it is, to take it
for an affront, if their guests rise from the Table, before they have filled
their crop twice or thrice, and discharged it as often by vomiting their lading
up again, which perhaps, if it light into their neighbors lap, is only taken
for an act of necessity, and an endeavor to make amends to the master of the
feast: for the greatest thanks he expects, is to hear a man relate the next
day, that he did not spare to make himself a Beast yesterday through his noble
and liberal entertainment. A man who intends to follow the mode of these
treatments, is not to call simply for (trincken) drink at Table; but
(zuzauffen) for a draught, (rather for a traffe like hogs;) that is as much as
he can well swallow down with an open throat, or no less than will swell him
to that bigness, as forces him to unbutton two or three buttons of his
doublet, and so drink as long, until all his buttons are dispatched: and by
that time they are got to their greatest happiness, which is to lie dead drunk
one a top the other. Wherein, are these men different from so many hogs, lying
one upon the other? they grunt in that dead sleep like hogs. They be fowl, kick
and tumble over one another like hogs: were there hogs among them, they could
not distinguish themselves from those hogs. And is this then a happiness to be
a hog? they are worse than hogs, for hogs discern one another; but they are
blind, dumb and deaf: These men are more fit to receive the Devil than
happiness, like unto the herd of swine which the Devil enterd.

As for the other Summum Bonum of the Epicureans, it is so far from an
acquiessence and Joy, that Aristotle makes a detestation of it. Look in his
Probl. (...).

II. No less are they mistaken, who make their wealth their god, oftentimes
not regarding how they come to it, whether by craft or overreaching of others.
These misers instead of embracing a perfect Joy, they precipitate themselves
into a miserable and Tanteleon covetousness, being tormented with insatiable
pangs after more money, thirsting with a fiery drought, not to be quenched by
the pouring all the West India mines upon them. If many in their tun-bellies,
were but sensible of the torments and unquietness, which do accompany their
Summum Bonum, they would soon desist from grapling after their tuns of gold.
The experience of the great Moral Philosopher Seneca, might well persuade them
to imitate his dictates of competency: for he, although his estate was computed
to the value of threescore hundred thousand Pounds, as Justus Lipsius records
of him; yet being sensible of the great weight in keeping of it, and tormented
with burning desires to increase it, did contemn it all, being fully persuaded,
that contentment was of greater worth, than all his treasure.

III. In some Countries the greatest accomplishment of a Gentleman is counted
to be his breeding and good behavior, which in France is called bonne mine,
wherein the more a man can please his Madame, the braver Gentleman he is
accounted: so that all their education, as their dancing, their study in
pleasing discourses, tends only to delight their Ladies, and themselves:
insomuch that in their confabulations with them, they imagine themselves to be
possessed of an unparalel happiness: which, their having a countenance marked
with smiles and joy: their Eyes sparkling with luster: their Bodies being
altogether transformed into an air: the continual gesticulations of their
Bodies, and trepidation of their Voices, do abundantly testify. The plurality
of the world does unanimously agree herein, that it is a great happiness, and
no less contentment to pass away the time in mirth and pleasant discourses,
wherein a man's mind seems to be much satisfied, wishing the night to be
spent, that his wonted mirth might be disclosed again through the presence of
the ensuing day. The whole troop of Poets seem to be sworn to bend their wits
only to extol the happiness and joys with which this Bonum is endued, and to
make it analogal to the Summum Bonum; for may they say, here are persons taken
up with a contemplation, surprised by an admiration: not only so, but they
receive thence great satisfaction, and joy; whence it appears, that there is
some resemblance, and more than there is in any other Bonum: This is the
ground, why Poets descant thus upon their gods, in feigning to be ravished by
one another discourses, and to be stupefied through amorous Joys: This they
assign upon them, as being the greatest happiness, and therefore worthy of
Gods. On the other side, this Bonum may be numbered among transitory felicities,
and therefore is not the greatest: for a man here is, as it were, in a dream,
wherein he phansieth multiplicity of Passages, and when he awakes, all is
vanished. The like is observable in this case: we talk of sundry subjects
successively, which serves only to drive away the time, and therein it
pleases the mind, there being nothing more tedious to it, than idleness. This
is fickle, and alterable, satisfying the soul at one time, and not at another;
for a while only, and not for always; we may admire one person for his
discourse to day, to morrow we may admire our selves for admiring the same
person yesterday. The discourse being once ended the happiness vanishes, and
is the same with a dream: for in a dream we seem to be as joyful in
discoursing with any pleasant person, as we are, when we are awake; but the
dream being discussed, all vanishes with it. Pray, what difference is there
between a joy apprehended in a dream, and a joy perceived when one is awake?
yea oftentimes the profusion of joy is greater in a dream than when we are
awake. Well may we thence proclaim, that all is vanity.

IV. No small number are they, who place their greatest happiness in being merry
once or twice a week with their Wives at their Country-houses. All their
toiling and moiling tends only to procure so much wealth, as to be thereby in a
capacity of purchasing themselves a Country House, where a man may leave' his
consort, and after a few moments absence return laden with joy, as if newly
arrived from a Japan voyage. This meeting after some hours parting does so
extremely transport him, through the sudden spying of his female second self
among the green leaves and odoriferous flowers, that he imagines himself to be
no less than an Angel admitted into a Mahomets Paradise. This may be a
happiness if prudently managed; but to compare it to a Summum Bonum, is to
make it appear a Summum Malum. Assuredly that, which a man at several times
does leave and return to: does love and hate: does trust and suspect: does
agree and disagree with: does esteem and revile: does please and displease him,
is far distant from a Summum Bonum, which at all seasons and minutes is La. Ty.
Semper Idem. That which depends upon a man's humor, being disposed to
alteration, and variety every moment, cannot be the greatest happiness, which
alone lasts to all eternity.

V. What shall I say of honor? A gift, which is at the disposal of every
bumken, and sometimes a liberal bounty of the vilest persons: for it depends
upon their pleasure, whether they will confer it upon a deserving person, or
not. Honor is a thing, wherewith men are often clodded, and so come to loathe
it. They have so much of it sometimes, that they do not regard it at any time.
Men need not to make a Summum Bonum of an air, of a shaking of a hat, of a bow,
of a curtzy, of a leg, of a gaze: all this is but a flash. And what are the
fruits and effects of it? Possibly they may perceive a swelling of their mind,
and a puffing up of their spirit, which may put them into a Bridegroom posture,
wherein he does more admire himself, than a Bridegroom does his Bride.

VI. Many thereare, who take a wonderful delight in swearing; each third word
must have a S'wounds, or by God, or a God damme me for its attendance,
otherwise the language would seem to be imperfect, or at least to want its
natural eloquence. This interjection of speech is so much practiced, that some
Masters of Languages in France make it the third lesson to their scholars. A
Germane newly arrived at Paris, and applying his mind to the study of that
language, showed me his third Lesson, which his master had recommended to him,
to learn by heart. This piece of Doctrine did contain no less than thirty or
five and thirty oaths; some of which he said were of the last years invention,
which his Master had particularly marked. I asked the Gentleman, how he would
come to know their proper places and insertions; he answered me, that that was
the first Question, he asked his Master, who resolved him, that a little
converse with the French would soon make him perfect in that business. O
Tempora, O Mores! What is there more abominable! How is it possible for men so
to mistake, and not know, that this is Belzebubs Rhetoric, the Devils mother
Tongue, Satan's mirth. This is the only language wherein the Devils and men,
Wizards and their spirits understand one another.

VII. I doubt not, but by this time you are better resolved, and fully
persuaded, that none of these beforementioned instances are a Summum Bonum.
And before I put a period to the enumeration of the adulterin greatest
Happiness, I must tell you my scope in having declared them by a prejudicial
style, or rather a style, which may seem to partake of a lightness, being
altogether unbecoming to my intended purpose. In reference to the first, I
confess, I have a prejudice against them, as they are falsely taken and
supposed to be the greatest Happiness, and may beguile us of the true
Happiness; and therefore I have detected and enquired into their height and
highest degree of their good, delight or happiness; which to perform, I was
compelled to make use of such kind of flashy and light expressions.

VIII. As they are good, and bear only a representation of good, they are
necessarily and highly to be embraced: because they conduce to the enjoyment of
the greatest Good, and are effects, tokens and signs of it. Meat and Drink are
preservatives of man, and therefore conduce to the enjoyment of the greatest
Good. They are created and ordained through the goodness of the greatest Good,
which is an effect, token, and sign of the greatest Good. To embrace these as
Good is to embrace them with temperance; whose potential parts are four: 1.
Abstinence, which consists in a moderation of eating. 2. Sobriety, which
consists in a moderation of drinking. The other two parts are Chastity and
shamefac'dnesse, which do consist in moderating the affections of man and woman
toward one another.

IX. Riches, as they are external good things, are not to be absolutely
rejected, if moderated according to the Rules of liberality. They are the
necessary means, through which all humane Policy is exercised.

X. Affability, mutual converse and society, conduce much to man's edification
in knowledge. Hence does Aristotle define Man, (...). Man is a Politic living
creature. Politic is to be inclinable to a mutual conversation. Were it not,
that man had the benefit of converse, he might require Methusalem's years, for
to furnish himself with a competent knowledge.

XI. Man, as he is alone, is a melancholy creature, and therefore needs a
suitable companion to cheer him, whereby he is the better disposed for to
receive a greater happiness. The sutablenesse and delight, which he finds in
his fellow, does fix his thoughts and his actions, and thereby diverteth him
from infinite occasions of falling into evil. On the other side, men, that are
single, are much inclined to wandering, and exposed thereby to all manner of
temptations; to covet illegal objects; to act unlawful actions, to the hazard
and danger of their lives; and above all to evil thoughts, which the Devil does
suggest to them. If every man did adhere to a suitable companion, he could
hardly commit evil: I mean sins of commission: for being prepossest through the
pleasing fellowship of his Consort, he could not covet any thing which was
illegal: for did he covet any thing else above that which he does enjoy, it
supposes a greater convenience in that object, which he does covet: but since
that, which he has made choice of, is, next to the Summum Bonum, most suitable
to him, he cannot let his desires slide another way. The worst actions, which
men do act, are either when they are alone, or when they are in other company,
and absent from their partner. When they are in other company, they are apt to
be drunk, to swear, and to project base designs, which a man seldom or never
does perpetrate in the presence with his mate. Or if he did, it is an hundred
to one, if her fear, modesty, or some other virtue did not prevent him. Man
could seldom think evil thoughts, because his companion is supposed to divert
him in proposing pleasant or useful discourses. What woman is there, which can
be inordinate in any of these fore-instanced actions, if she is suited to a
mate, and adheres to his fellowship only. It Is true, women and men, although
both joined in a constant adherence, have sometimes agreed in wicked designs;
but this happens always in a couple unsutably paired, and consequently much
given to wandering; so that they did not contract that evil habit from
themselves, but from others. Had the first man and the first woman continued
constantly together, it would have been a far harder task for the Devil to have
deluded them: but they being separated, although but for a few moments, and
either of them admitting conference with the Devil, were soon corrupted. What
an easy task of Government would it be, if most men were paired so, as never
to be asunder from their fellow. They could hardly assent to mischief; or if
they were bent to it, Law might sooner work upon their joint-interest, than if
it were single. But take this only as by way of discourse.

XII. It is necessary among men to give honor to whom it is due. and to return
it with thanks, when they do deserve it. Were it only to cause a distinction of
persons, in respect to civil Government, it does imply a necessity. It is
proper for us to know what honor is; for how could we else acquit our duty in
this part to God, to the supreme Magistrate, or to our Parents?

XIII. We are not to be over-scrupulous in taking of an oath, provided it tend
to the preservation of the Commonwealth, and that the supreme Magistrate (be it
the King, Prince, or plural Magistrate) do require it. We are obliged to it
upon a double consideration: 1. Because the Magistrate does command, or imposed
it, which is obliging among all Nations. 2. Because it tends to the
preservation of the whole body of the people. And this common reason does
convince to be binding.

CHAP. VIII. Of the Subject of Natural Theology.
1. Man consisting of Body and Soul is the adequate subject of Natural
Theology. 2. Reasons proving the Soul to be the original and principal subject
of Theology. 3. That the Understanding and Will are really and formally one.
The confutation of the vulgar definition of Will. A full explication of the
Will, and the manner of its acting. What speculalative and practical signify.
4. What the Will is in a large sense. 5. What the Will is in a strict sense. 6.
An Explanation upon the first description of Will. 7. The Effects of the Will.
Whether appetibility does not equally imply volibility, and appetibility in a
strict sense. 8. Whether man's appetite is distinct from his Will.


I. THe fourth Question proposed is, Which is the Subject of Natural Theology?
By Subject I mean the Subjectum inhaesionis, wherein this habit is inherent. To
answer you in general, The whole man, as he consists of soul and body, is the
subject of Theology; for the effects of it, to wit happiness and joy, are as
sensibly received by the body, as by the soul: for the body receives its
essence, conservation, and bodily pleasures from it Namely from Theology, that
is, from its nearest, end, or Summum Bonum.
. The soul cannot alone be properly said to be the subject, because the soul
without the body is not man.

II. The soul is originally and principally the subject of Theology. I say
originally, because the soul is the original cause of the pleasures of the
body: yea, and of its constitution: for the body was created for the soul, and
not the soul for the body. The soul is the original cause of the pleasures of
the body, in that the soul does make choice of them, and applies them to the
body: for example, meat, drink, and other pleasures are applied to the body, in
that the soul makes choice of them, and conceives them to be pleasant to the
body; otherwise the body could not attain to them. The soul can enjoy
pleasures, when the body is in pain; but the body cannot, when the soul is in
pain.

The soul is the principal subject of Theology, because the greatest happiness
and good is enjoyed by it, the delights of the body not being comparable to
them of the soul, The soul receives its pleasure by instants of time; the body
only by succession.

III. The operation, whereby the soul does embrace the greatest good and
happiness, is from the understanding, as it is speculative and practick, and
not as it is a twofold faculty, formally distinct through the understanding
and the will; for these are not really and essentially distinct. I prove it: if
the understanding cannot understand without the will, or the will without the
understanding, then they are not really and essentially distinct: because it is
proper to beings, which are really and essentially distinct, to operate without
each other. But the understanding cannot understand without the will; neither
can the will will without the understanding. Therefore they are not really
distinct.

I prove the Minor: The will is primarly a bending of the understanding to an
action of the mind; but the understanding cannot understand, unless it bends
to that action of the mind: So neither can the understanding be bent to action,
unless it understands. Wherefore the one does imply the other. The most
there is between them is a modal distinction.

You may object, that it follows hence, that a man may be said to will, when he
understands, to understand when he wills: which predications are absurd.

I answer, That it includes no absurdity at all: for a man, when he
understands, does will every particular act of the understanding, which he
understands, or otherwise how could he understand? On the other side, a man
understands, when he wills according to that trite saying, Ignoti nulla
Cupido, That which a man does not know, he cannot desire or will. Wherefore I
argue again, that the one includes the other, the will implies the
understanding, and the understanding the will. Possibly you may deny my
supposed definition of will, which is a bending to an action of the mind. If
you refuse it, propose a better. Your opinion, it may be is to wander with the
multitude, and so you commend this: The will is, through which a man by a
foregoing knowledge does covet a suitable or convenient good, and shunneth an
inconvenient evil.

I will first account the absurdities of this definition, and afterward prove
them to be so. First, you affirm, That there fore-goeth a knowledge before a
man wills. Secondly, That a man does always covet a convenient good.
Thirdly, That a man shunneth all inconvenient evil. Fourthly, That the will
always either coveteth or shunneth. Fifthly, The definition contains
superfluous words, as inconvenience and convenience. Sixthly, You assert that
two contrary acts proceed from one formal habit. Seventhly, This definition is
a division of a habit into its acts. Eighthly, You do positively affirm, That
the will is really and essentially distinct from the understanding. Many more I
might deduct, but these being sufficient, I shall now direct my pen to them
particularly.

First, You say, That there fore-goeth a knowledge before every act of the
will. Upon this I demand from you, How comes the understanding to know? You
may answer, through her self: and what is it else, to know through ones self,
but to know through ones own will? Ergo, The will is a concomitant of the
understanding, and the understanding of the will, and consequently the one does
not precede the other. Or thus, Can the understanding know against her will, or
without her will? If so, then man is no voluntary creature, in that he acts,
without a will.

Secondly, You declare, That a man does always covet a convenient good. Herein
you contradict your self: for before you said, that the understanding did
understand a volible object without or before the will: but to understand a
volible object, is to will to understand it, and yet not covet it: Therefore
according to your own words, a man did not always covet through his will. 2. A
man does covet evil as evil: Wherefore he does not always covet good. The
antecedence I have proved above. 3. A man does sometime covet an
inconvenientgood: for he covets Arsenick to kill himself. You will answer to
this, that he does covet it as a convenient good, for to ease him from some
trouble or grief. By this solution you confound your self, in taking objective
good and formal good for the same thing, which according to Aristotle are
different. If so, then your answer will not hold: for the Question is
concerning objective good, whereas your answer relates to a formal good. The
ease, which a man finds through the removal of trouble, is the formal good;
the Arsenick is the objective good: this presupposed, the Arsenick is good in
it self, but relatively it is inconvenient to that man, for it destroys his
essence. You may reply, That a man does not take it to destroy his essence, but
to release himself from his misery. Notwithstanding I say, he knew before he
took the Ratsbane, that it would kill him; wherefore this knowledge of
inconvenience foregoing the willing of inconvenience, does according to your
own definition infer that he willed it, as inconvenient, because he fore-knew
it to be inconvenient.

Thirdly, I say, That a man does not always shun an inconveent evil: because
he does not shun sickness, when he is diseased: neither can he shun all
inconveniences; for he falls into many. So likewise in the fore-given
instance, he cannot shun sickness or death, although he may wish it remote
from him, but that is not shunning of it: wherefore shunning is an improper
term to be used in this definition.

Fourthly, You conceive, That the will always does either covet or shun. This
is against most Peripateticks, who say, that the will can suspend its action,
which suspension is neither coveting or shunning.

Fifthly, Since that good implies convenience, and evil inconvenience, what
need you to add convenience and inconvenience: Wherefore both must be
superfluous.

Sixthly, To shun evil and to covet good, are two acts formally contrary: If
so, How can these flow from one habit? Possibly you endeavor to escape the
force of this Objection, in saying, that the one may proceed per se, and the
other per accidens from a formal habit. If I should grant this, your definition
will prove illegal, because there must nothing be inserted into a Definition,
but what agrees per se with the definitum.

Seventhly, This is rather an Accidental Division of a habit into its acts:
Wherefore this Division is not so much as Essential; because it is not grounded
upon the form of the Divisum.

Eighthly, You conclude the will to be really and essentially different from
the understanding. You make too much haste; you should first show, that the
will and understanding are Real Beings; and how will you do that according to
your own received Doctrine of Real Beings? which teaches, that they only are
Real Beings, which exist, or can exist without the understanding: if so, then
the understanding, for to be a real being, must exist without its self; and is
not this absurd?

Having made appear to you the falsity of the common Doctrine of Will, I come
now to explain, how the understanding is made practical, and how speculative.

Wherefore in the first place, Mark, what the understanding is. The
understanding is the discerning, apprehending, or judging faculty of all
Objects, which are objected from without, or from within. The understanding
judges of these objects according to their distinct representation. Objects
represent themselves in a twofold manner: 1. Essentially, when the essence
consisting of all its modes united is represented to the understanding. 2.
Modally, which is, when one mode or more, is, or are singularly represented to
the understanding. You may apprehend this better by an example. The essential
representation of a Bull is, wherein you perceive him by, or in all his modes
united; particularly in perceiving him in that shape, of having such a figure,
of bearing horns, of being hairy and cloven-footed, of having unity, truth and
perfection, etc. But when I conceive only one of his modes, without conceiving
any of the others, that is a modal representation; as in conceiving his horns
only, or the goodness of every mode by it self, or the goodness of the whole
essence. Observe then, these several concepts are several actions, because they
are of several objects: Which difference of action is called a material
difference.

Again, This action is but one formally, and depends from one formal power; so
that one power can promote but one formal action: as in this instance; The
power, which my hand has of writing, fitteth it to write several letters, as
I. D. etc. the writing these several letters are distinct actions, because they
differ in figure, which is a material difference: but then again, the action of
writing is but one formally, flowing from one formal power of writing. So
likewise a knife cutteth paper, wood, etc. the cutting of these are materially
distinct actions; but again the cutting is also but one formal action; for a
knife cutteth these through one virtue of sharpness, and therefore its power
is but one formally. In the same manner, I say, does the soul understand or
perceive several objects; as, in conceiving the entire essence of a Being; or
its modes in particular; as its goodness, unity, etc. These are all several
actions differing materially one from the other; for the conceiving of unity is
not the conceiving of Good, etc. Again, The action of understanding or
conceiving is but one formally flowing from one mind, or one understanding
faculty, otherwise were it double, it would require a double name. Moreover,
there is but one first and formal faculty of all beings; because all second
faculties are derived from one: and what is this faculty in man, but the
understanding? Whence it appears, that the understanding faculty is one
formally, and manifold materially: or rather to speak more properly, the
understanding faculty is but one, and its acts are many. According to this last
Caution, the understanding cannot be said to be speculative, or practick; but
its acts are either speculative or practick. Or thus, The understanding is
formally only speculative; I mean speculative, as it is taken in an universal,
indifferent and unlimited sense. Further, The understanding is materially also
speculative and practick. By speculative I mean an absolute and single habit of
conceiving an Essence or Mode, without any other duplicated and relative
action. Mark that practick here imports practick strictly so called, and
poetic.
Practick is attributed to the understanding, when it acts (that is
understands) upon an essence or mode by a duplicated and relative action. A
relative action of the understanding is, when it considers, and understands
an object relatively, or related to another object, which among the most
universal attributes of a being is goodness. So that to understand a being
practically, is to understand it to be good, and related through that goodness
to another being: as when I understand an Ox to be good for plowing, carrying,
etc. I consider him relatively, as related to another being: Now then, this I
call a practick Act of the understanding, and from such acts is the
understanding termed practical. Hence let us examine, What difference there is
between these two objects being variously acted upon by us, and wherein they do
agree. The difference which there is between them arises from themselves, and
is that the one is understood not to be the other: They agree in that they were
apprehended or acted upon by one faculty of the mind, or that they are objects
of one and the same faculty of the mind. The distinction, which there is
imagined in the faculty is none, for it is the same faculty that understands
a thing to be good, to be true, etc. A Looking-glass is not changed from being
a Glass, because it represents several essences and modes; as faces, hands, or
legs: so neither is the understanding different or changed, because it discerns
several objects.

It may be one may say, that this is not the case; but whether this practical
understanding is the will, or not, is the doubt: for the will, you may imagine,
is Actually to move, or to act that, which the understanding has conceived
convenient: When a man conceives a thing to be good; as in the
beforementioned instance of an Ox to be good for the plow, it is the action
of the understanding, as it is practick; and this cannot be called the will;
but the will is, when you act that, which the understanding has conceived
expedient to be acted; as, when you put an Ox to plow after you have
apprehended him to be good for it, does issue from the will; and is, as it
were, a command of the soul upon the inferior faculties to do that, which the
understanding has perceived to be practick: So that practick is that, whereby
we act, and not whereby we may act. The understanding is named practick,
because thence the soul may act that, which the understanding apprehends
practick. The will is more properly termed practick, because thereby the soul
does act: for (...) signifies action, which (according to Aristotle) is either
immanent or transient: so that Praxis in a large sense, is predicated of (...)
(which is vulgarly referred to a transient action) and of Praxis, as it is
strictly limited to an immanent action.

To remove this Objection, you must consider these notions:

1. That the soul is a single Being, and therefore has but one formal single
power, which formal power seems (but really is not) to be different from it
self, in that, in the brain it understands; in the Liver it sanguificateth;
in the Muscles it moves. These are only external and material differences;
not formal; for it is one and the same faculty of the soul, which moves,
understands, etc.

2. This Question may be taken in a double meaning: 1. Whether the will and
understanding, in respect to the soul, are different faculties? That is,
Whether the soul does understand and will by two powers differing in
themselves? This is made clear in the Discourse of Powers. 2. Whether these
faculties in respect to themselves are really different: to wit, Whether to
refuse or embrace an object, which are the acts of the will; and to judge or
apprehend it to be embraced or refused, which is the act of the practick
understanding, are different acts; and consequently proceeding from habits
materially different. Now, take my answer.

I say, That to will and understand an object practically, are acts really
identicated, and proceed from one faculty of judgment or understanding. I
prove it. To make an impression from within, upon the fancy, is an act of the
intelligent faculty; but to will and understand practically is caused by an
impression from within upon the Fancy. Ergo, They are caused or proceed
through one and the same act, from one and the same faculty, which is the
understanding. I confirm the Assumption by this instance: When a man does will
meat: 1. He makes a practical science upon it, and judges it to be good or
convenient for his body: Next after this, he does judge it necessary for him;
as, to eat, when his stomach is hungry: 3. He judges the means, whereby to
procure it, to be a local motion; as, through which a man does move toward his
meat, and moves it unto his stomach. 4. He judges, That to make a motion to
an object, is by moving the spirits of the fancy toward that object, which
motion excites all the other spirits, contained in the external members, to
move to the same object. Lastly, To judge is to be moved by an impression of
any species upon the fancy, which the Agent understanding made thereon: so
that these four judgments of the understanding are impressions and motions
upon, and in the fancy, which being constituted, the will is also
constituted. You may then observe, That the will is not a single act, but one
act composed out of many single acts, and united one to the other by a
subordination. All these four motions concurring to a will are effected by one
faculty, and therefore are not different. These four acts are (as it were)
parts, which constitute a will: for one being deficient, a man cannot will,
unless he judges an object to be good; he cannot covet it, neither will he
covet it, unless he judges it necessary to make up a pleasure, or to supply a
need; for there are many things, which are good, and yet we do not covet them,
because we do not judge them necessary for to make up a pleasure or need. These
two are to no purpose, if the apprehension of means be not framed,

The understanding being now bent and inclined to an object, makes an
impression upon the animal spirits lodged within the feat of the fancy: for
how can the understanding otherwise judge of means, unless it makes an
impression of them upon the fancy? which is no sooner done, but all the
members move. The Fancy is like unto the spring of a Watch, which being
moved, all the wheels are moved by it. All these acts, we see proceed from one
agent intellect, and are all acts of that faculty, and why should they then be
counted to be really different from one another?

IV. 1. The Will is, whereby the understanding of man is inclined to action.
The will, as I have showed, is an act of the understanding, wherefore I do
define it by the understanding faculty. Note that Will here is the same with
the practick underderstanding.

V. 2. The Will (in a strict sense) is an action of the understanding upon an
object, as far as it is appetible, or inappetible.

Will in the first definition is supposed to be the inclination or motion of
the understanding to action: That is to any action in general; whether to good
or to evil; to a single, or reflex action; to one single or many actions
subnected to one another. The understanding, when it does understand, it first
wills and inclines to that action, before it can be said to understand: if
then, there be any priority imaginable between the understanding and the will
(as scarce there is) the will must precede the understanding. But, as I said,
there is none: because inclining to action, and to be in action are the same
thing: nevertheless we may suppose them to be distinguished ratione: and a
part Rei they are distinguished materially.

Here may be objected, that that, whereby the understanding is inclined to
action, is the object: for it is the object, which does incline the
understanding to action: Wherefore the object is the will, which is absurd. You
have almost rightly apprehended my meaning; it is true, that through the object
the understanding is moved to action: for without an object the understanding
could not act: And from the object is the understanding said to act, and
receives the denomination of acting from it: but now, it does not follow, that
the will is the object: yet materially it is in the object; formally in the
understanding.

You may furnish your self with another objection, which is, That it follows
hence, that the understanding is always practick, and never speculative.

To this I answer, That practick either implies action, and a bending to
action, whether the object, in which that action does terminate, be within, or
without: or the Acting and bending only to an external object, which action
upon an external object is not single but many; besides it must be also related
to the goodness of an object: according to the former implication the
understanding is always practick, when it does understand; according to the
letter it is not.

VI. The second definition is more strict and limited, the will here being
determined either to an appetibility (which denotech either a convenience
primarly, or a farther constitution, preservation and perfectionation,
pleasure, or goodness in the object; secundarily and per accidens, an evil and
imperfectionation) whereby the understanding is incited to a second and farther
action; or inappetibility. Scaliger in his Cccviith Exerc. 3. D. defines the
will very consentaneous, to what it is set down for here. The will (says he)
is the understanding extended to have, or to do that, which it apprehends. By
this he consents, that the will and understanding are the same really. That,
which he intends by an extended understanding, is before employed by a farther
and second action of the understanding. It is a true saying of his, That the
will is the understanding extended, or judgment prolonged: for when one does
ask you, whether you will go to sleep; first, you judge what sleep is, then you
prolong your judgment in judging sleep to be necessary; thirdly, you extend
your concept, until you conclude that you will go to sleep; and what is this,
but the understanding prolonged.

By a farther Action, the will is distinct from speculation, whereby an object
is conceived only by a first intention, without the consequence of any farther
action: By action, I intend effection, or doing.

VII. The acts of will, in a strict sense, are to embrace, or to reject an
object.

The object of the will is a Being, as far as it is appetible, or unappetible.
This faceth somewhat against the customary speech of Philosophers, who
attribute appetite primarly to animals and naturals: and secundarily to man; if
so, then appetibility is not the ratio formalis of the object of the will, but
of the appetite. So that volibility (if such a word might be suffered) is
rather the proper object of the will. Herein are two questions contained. 1.
Whether appetibility be not a word equally denoting volibility and appetibility
in a restrained sense. 2. Whether man's appetite is distinct from his will.

To the first I answer, That appetibility is equally attributed to man, and to
other creatures: I prove it: Aristotle defined Good to be that, which all
beings have an appetite unto: if so, then appetability is common to man, since
that man is a Being, and has an appetite unto Good.

IX. The second doubt is somewhat more involved in bryan. Scaliger in the same
Exerc. alleged in the next foregoing Paragraph, states a difference between
the appetite of man, and his will. For appetites (says he) are propensities to
natural conveniences: with which we are born, like as with our senses:
wherefore the appetite is moved either from our sense, or fancy, or memory;
from which again that power is moved, which we call the will. Wherefore the
appetite is before the will, that is, before that act, whereby we will a thing.
Thus far Scaliger. If this be true, it is a Paradox, that one and the same
object through one formal manner of moving should move two formal powers of one
Being. How can this be? One being has but one formal power, whereby it is
distinct from all others. So man has but one formal power, which is his power
of reasoning, through which he is distinguished from all other beings: Wherefore
the appetite of man is not distinct from his will. But Scaliger says, That the
appetite is sometime checked by the will. Ergo, They are different. The
Antecedence is evident in this instance: A man does frequently long for a
thing, which his will does contradict; as in coveting for drink, when he has a
drowth, or in longing for sack in a fever, the will does not always assent to
it: Wherefore the will is different from them appetites, because the one can be
existent without the other

In answer to this I say, that these are not properly appetites, to which
(namely appetites) a knowledge does necessarily concur; but they are only
improperly and analogically termed appetites, because they agree with a proper
appetite in having an inclination to a thing. Wherefore a proper appetite being
always concomitated by a knowledge, these forementioned instances cannot be
denominated appetites, but natural inclinations and propensities: for if a man
is predicated to have an appetite for any thing, it is equivalent, as if he
were predicated to have a will to a thing: Wherefore there is only one proper
appetite in man, as he is man, which is his will.

Arguments to prove a free will in man. A reconciliation of the Calvinists with
the Arminians. That man has a remnant of theologick good surviving in him. The
state of the controversy. The division of it.


I. THe chief respect, through which a man does differ from Animals or
Naturals, is his will, which is a free principle, through which he acts
freely, that is, without any irresistible impulse; for there is no object,
whether good or evil; pleasant or sorrowful, but it is left to the wills
freedom, whether it will embrace it, or reject it.

II. The freedom of man's will, in reference to its act, is either a
determination or assent, of man to act, or not to act: or else it is an assent
to act upon a certain object, or not to act upon that certain object: o^to act
upon a certain mode of an object, or not to act upon that certain mode: or to
act upon the goodness of an object in common, or particular, or not to act
upon the goodness of such objects: or to act upon the evil of an object in
common or particular, or not to act upon the evil of rhat object; or to act
upon good, or upon evil.

These are the particulars, whereunto the freedom of man's will does extend.

And first, A man has freedom of acting, or of not acting, through his will. A
man in willing to sleep, he wills to will no more, before he has refreshed
himself by sleep. So that herein a man has a will of acting or not acting
indeterminately, which sort of willing freedom is termed, Libertas quoad
exercitium actus. Such a freedom of will there is in man: for a man in willing
to sleep wills not to will, that is, not to act through his will. A man in
willing not to sleep may will to will, or to continue in action of willing or
understanding. This is a plain Libertas contradiction is ad actionem, and non
actionem, sive ad agendum and non agendum: for it is between an ens and a non
ens.

III. The second kind of freedom in the will is to act upon an object: I mean a
whole essence or object, as it does consist of all its modes united: as for
instance, a man may covet a whole Tree, or only a branch of it; a whole house,
or only a room. Now in coveting a whole Tree, or a whole house, he coveteth an
entire essence with all its modes: or else a man may also reject a whole Tree
or house; and so rejects a whole essence.

IV. Thirdly, The will may choose to act upon a particular mode, as the truth
or quantity of an essence, etc. For it makes choice to act (that is to
apprehend or contemplate) upon these modes particularly. Neither let it seem
strange to you, that the understanding or will in contemplation should be
termed willing or practick: for in that very contemplation the understanding is
practick, for it does both act and will that action.

V. Fourthly, The will may act upon the goodness of an object in particular,
or it may refuse it. Herein I do thwart some Authors, who strive to prove the
contrary, to wit, that the will, when it does act upon a good object, it cannot
refuse it, but does always covet it. Others do with more caution assert, That
the will of man cannot reject or refuse the most universal good; for which
purpose they quote Austin, 10. B. 20. Chap. of Confess. Were it possible (says
he) to ask all men at once, whether they would be happy? they would answer
without any further pa^sing upon it, they would. But suppose this were granted
(as really it is disputable, there being many in the world so wicked, that if
they were invited to embrace the true Summum Bonum, either for to bid adieu to
their own spurious happiness, or to wave their obstinate opinions, they would
rather excuse themselves; as I once heard a Jesuit cry out in a dispute, That
he would sooner choose to be damned with St. Austin, then go to Heaven with a
Protestant.) Yet they need arguments to prove that a particular good may not be
waved, although perceived by the understanding: How many are there, who neglect
and revile many good things, such as are convenient for their souls and bodies?
Besides, this granted infers a necessity upon man's will, whereby he is cut off
from not willing; which implies a contradiction in the will of not to be the
will.

VI. Fifthly, The will acts upon the evil of an object, in that it can refuse
or embrace it, as it is evil, and as it knows it to be evil, without having
an apprehension of any goodness in it. A man can hang himself, or kill
another, without apprehending any thing good in it, and he can also refuse it.
Since that all beings act for an end and purpose, it may be demanded, What end
and purpose can a man have in coveting an evil object, as it is evil? I answer,
an evil end. The Devils covet evil, as it is evil; for none can imagine the
least good in Devils: if so, why may not men covet evil as evil, many among
them being worse than Devils. It is worse to persevere in evil and wickedness
in the midst of the enjoyments of good things, than to affect evil without the
least enjoyment of good; but Atheists persevere in the greatest evil in the
midst of good things; wherefore they are to be accounted worse than Devils, who
affect evil without the least enjoyment of good.

VII. Lastly, A man may will either a good object or an evil one. This is an
action of will, as it is free to contraries, and is called among Philosophers
(Libertas quoad specificationem actus) a freedom of will in specifying an act,
that is, an affecting an object in particular, as it is opposite to another
appetible object in contrariety; which is to will an object, as it is good, or
as it is evil; pleasant, or sorrowful, etc. The preceding distinctions of the
acts of will, proceed from her, as she is free Quoad contradictoria, or quoad
exercitium actus.

VIII. Hence you may know, that free will (Liberum arbitrium) in reference to
its faculty, is an indetermination or indifference in the will of man of acting
or not acting, and of acting upon good or evil. Nevertheless it is a
controversy among Moralists: 1. Whether the will be indifferent to each
opposite, which opposites are either between contradictories, as between
acting, and not acting: or between contraries, as between acts upon good or
evil. 2. Whether the will is free in all its acts. Vilsten. Cent. 1. Dec. 4. q.
6. states two conclusions for the resolving of these doubts. 1. Says he, The
will is not indifferent to each contrary, to wit, to good and evil. His reason
is, because the will cannot covet evil as evil; but when the will does covet
evil, it is rather forced than free, because it is an evil disposition does
compel her to it: wherefore that being against nature, it is rather to be
accounted violent than free. First, He says, The will cannot covet evil, as
evil: Next he affirms, That the will can covet evil, but then she is forced.
This is a manifest contradiction, that the will can covet evil, and cannot
covet evil. Again, That the will should covet evil by coaction from within, is
to contradict most Philosophers, whose tenent is, That the will cannot be
forced from within: Besides, to grant this, would be to suppose that man did
act necessarily, like unto naturals. Further, it would be very severe, should
God punish us, for doing an act, when we cannot do otherwise.

IX. His second Conclusion is, That the will of man is indifferent to each
contradictory opposite: because she can act upon a good object in particular,
and forbear. Herein he speaks the truth: but this is no more truly concluded,
but it is as fallaciously opposed by others: Their Argument is; because souls
in Heaven cannot but love God, and the damned cannot but hate him: both these
acting freely, it follows that the will is not indifferent to
contradictories. This infers nothing to the present dispute of man's will, only
of souls in Heaven and Devils. But I pass to the second Doubt proposed,
Whether the will of man is free in all her acts. Inorder to the clearing of
this doubt, you are to observe it. 1. That the acts of the will are of acting,
or not acting; or of acting upon a particular object, so as to covet it, or to
reject it. 2. That the act of the will after its whole assent or conclusion, is
not the will it self, and therefore freedom is not to be attributed to the act,
but to the power or faculty. This premised I po^^,

X. 1. That the will is free to act, or not to act. If man is free to think, or
not to think, he is free to will, or not to will; because a man's thought is
always concomitant to his will. But a man is free to think, or not to think.
Ergo, He is free to will or not to will. The Assumtion is confirmed in the
second Paragraph.

XI. 2. The will is free to act upon particular objects, as they are good or
evil. By will I mean the will of man, as he is in a natural and corrupt state,
not as he is in a supernatural or preternatural estate; for in the first he
cannot covet evil; in the last he cannot covet good. Neither is it to be
understood of man, as he was in an incorrupt state, most granting, that he
could covet good and evil: But the Question is, Whether man as he is in a
corrupt condition, and prone to evil, cannot do a good act, as much as the
first man being prone to good did an evil act. Observe also that good is either
theologick good, or moral good; and so is evil. The Question here is concerning
moral good and evil. Lastly, you are to understand here the freedom of man's
will, as he acts with the ordinary concurrence of God: and not, as he acts,
with an extraordinary concurrence of God with him.

XII. Man, as he is in a natural and corrupt state, has a free will of doing a
moral good act, or a moral evil act. What moral good and evil, and theologick
good and evil is, I have already set down in the 3d, 4th and 5th Chapters. I
prove this position. What ever a man does act with the foreknowledge of his
understanding, does proceed from his free will: But man acts moral evil, and
moral good, with the foreknowledge of his understanding: Ergo, Man does act
moral evil, and moral good through his free will. I confirm the Minor: There
are none that deny, that man does moral evil with the foreknowledge of his
understanding. That man does act a moral good act from himself without an
extraordinary concurrence of God with him, it appears; In that he can and
does covet meat and drink in moderation; and in that he can and does help the
poor and needy; and in that he can moderate his passions: all these are moral
good acts. They are good acts, in that they do perfectionate man in his
Essence: They are moral, in that they proceed from man's free will, and
foreknowledge.

XIII. Man has not a free will of doing a Theologick good act immediately
through himself, and without an extraordinary concurrence of God with him. A
Theologick good act is such, as God does require from us, and as he first gave
man a power of acting it: since then we have not such a power, as God first
gave unto man of acting good: it follows, that we cannot act such good acts
through our selves, as God does require from us.

XIV. Man has a free will of doing a Theologick good act with an extraordinary
concurrence of God with him. If God does concur with man in his actions in an
extraordinary manner, no doubt but God can and does make them Theologically
good, that is, good in the highest perfection; and such, as he himself does
require from us. Man, being so assisted through the extraordinary assistance of
God, acts freely notwithstanding; for it is still in his choice, whether he
will do such a Theologick good act or not. When God does assist us in an
extraordinary manner, it is not without our free will; for we must first will
and desire it with a burning desire, before God will assist us, which burning
desire does move him to assist us; neither will God refuse us, because he is
most good, and most merciful. Now then, when this desire cease in us, then
Gods extraordinary assistance cease with it; if then we can forbear this
desire, and continue it, we have still our free-wils. Besides, we also have a
free will of election, that is, of making choice of one good object before
another.

XV. 1. Man as he is in a natural state has a free will through himself, and
without an extraordinary concurrence of God with him, to procure Gods
extraordinary concurrence and assistance with and to him in his actions. The
means, whereby a natural man does appropriate it, is by fervent prayer: so that
man having a free will of procuring Gods extraordinary concurrence, has a
free will mediately to act a Theologick good act. Before I prove the first
branch of this sub-Conclusion, you are to mark, that we can do no action at
all, through our selves alone, without the ordinary concurrence of God with us:
for God has not given us an absolute power of being and acting, without the
concurrence of his preservating and assisting power; if he had, he would have
given all the power over us out of his hands, which is impossible and
unsuitable to the King of Kings to give away all his Glory, Honor and
Dominion. Again, had he done so, we should have returned the thanks due for so
great a goodness, in envying and reviling of him. Wherefore it follows, that
God has reserved a preservating and assisting power to himself, without which
we cannot continue in our beings, or do any action. If the first man could have
been, and acted through himself, and that without Gods assistance, he could
never have died, but since that he died, and could not maintain himself in his
being, and in that most perfect Essence, wherein he was created, without
adhering to Gods power; therefore he having deserted that power but for a
moment, and confiding upon his own, immediately fell, and was almost utterly
corrupted and lost: if then that the first man in that perfect Essence could
not subsist or act through himself alone without Gods aid, much less can we in
this deflected state, and weak nature, subsist or act without Gods assistance.
This assistance is Gods ordinary assistance, for were it extraordinary, we
should then act as perfectly as the first man did before his deficience.

2. After the probation of the necessity of Gods ordinary and extraordinary
concurrence, I come now to prove, that man, being assisted with Gods ordinary
power, can and does procure Gods extraordinary concurrence. Man, as he is in a
natural state For even then he is assisted with God's ordinary power.
, may and does know, that he has still some spark of Theologick good remaining
in him; for all men can and do know naturally, that there is a God; that there
is a Law enjoined by God upon men, as his subjects; that that Law is perfect;
that his actions are observed and acknowledged by him to be evil and sinful;
that through himself, without Gods extraordinary aid, he cannot act that, which
God does require from him; that God is Almighty, good, and merciful, and
therefore God will not deny any request of good, proceeding from a spark of
Theologick good, because therein man has still something in him, through which
he resembles God, which God will not abolish, and has tied himself through
his bountiful promises not to destroy. All these acts and knowledges proceed
from a Theologick good principle, and therefore man is partly Theologically
good, to whom, if he uses that natural power and means remaining in him, God
will not deny a supply against his defect. The natural power and means, which a
man does naturally and ordinarily put in action to procure Gods extraordinary
assistance, is his power of praying with zeal and earnestness: for a man
whenever he is in danger, great need, and intolerable pain, does naturally beg
and implore help. Therefore a zealous and earnest praying is a natural power,
(which nature does prompt us to) and means to procure Gods extraordinary
assistance.

Lastly, From all this it is undoubtedly true and evident, that man through
himself, and with the ordinary concurss of God with him, does and can procure
Gods extraordinary assistance, Which having procured, he has a free will of
acting theologick good.

3. That which is only morally good, will prove theologick evil at last. A
thing may properly be said to be good, although at last it changes into evil
and corruption; for as a Tree, which is a good natural thing, changes to an
entire corruption, when it dies: so a natural man whilst he lives is morally
good, and does moral good acts; but when he dies, he becomes entirely
corrupted, and altogether evil, that is, theologically evil.

XVI. 4. To shut up this succinct dispute of free will: I say, That man without
free will is no man, but a Beast: That man might justly be excused for his evil
acts: for had he no principle, whereby he acted freely, but did act necessarily
and by compulsion or coaction of the Divine power, he could not act evil, it
being impossible to God to act evil; or if man did act evil, it would be
without a will, and therefore it could be no sin: that man could not be
termed the cause of his moral actions, but God. Many other inconveniences and
absurdities do ensue in denying this truth, which to produce will prove
tedious. By this we may easily reconcile the Calvinists with the Arminians. The
Calvinists may rightly say, That man through himself cannot act a good act,
that is, cannot act a theological good act, with the ordinary concurrence of
God only. The Arminians may with no less confidence assert, That man has a
free will of doing good through himself, that is, has a means and principle
resting in him, whereby he may mediately do a theologick good act through
himself, and by that means may procure God's extraordinary concurrence: but the
greatest controversy, probable to arise between them, in my opinion is,
Whether a man has a free will, or a remnant of theologick good in him, whereby
he may procure God's extraordinary assistance through himself; or whether God
does stir up that spark of Good, being moved through his own mercy, and not
by what can proceed from man: for many hold, that man has no spark of Good
remaining in him, and consequently cannot be thence supposed to have a freewill
to beg God's extraordinary assistance; but it is God, who does out of his
singular goodness, free will, and pleasure, toward singular men, cast, and
infuse a measure of theologick good in them, through which they are made
capable of having access to God, and of praying to him: and this they say
Scripture implies by a new creation, regeneration, conversion, or the becoming
of a new man.

No doubt but this latter tenent is erroneous and absurd.

First, They affirm, That man has no spark of theologick good remaining in
him. This is false, as has been proved already, and shall be demonstrated more
at large elsewhere.

Secondly, Hereby they imply, that man does always act evil, and consequently
acts evil necessarily without a free will: And wherein does he then differ
from a Beast?

Thirdly, Should God cast his mercy or goodness upon that, which is altogether
evil; it follows, that God should love that, which is altogether evil; but
that is repugnant to God's nature, that being most good does necessarily reject
that from it, which is most evil.

Fourthly, Should God stir up that spark of Good in man, it proves, that
that Good is of no efficacy, and for no purpose, which is repugnant to common
reason, concluding, that all things, which are, are for to operate, and for an
end, and are not in vain: Therefore this spark of Good does, and can operate
for an end, to save it self, and glorify God: especially being accompanied
with God's ordinary concurrence, it is directly, as by a guide, led to God's
extraordinary concurrence and assistance. So then, if there be a spark of
theologick Good remaining in man, as without doubt there is, it is of the same
Nature with that, which was in the first man before his fall, who having a
free will to good and evil, infers, that this spark must necessarily retain the
same free will to good and evil, but in an improportionable manner, since that
man's will is much more habituated to evil, which does much dead that weak
remnant of good in him. It is certain, God does equally impart his mercy and
goodness to natural men, because they are of an equal state: Then again I
object; If so, then all men would become theologically Good, which is
erroneous: Wherefore I say, God is no more good or merciful to one natural
man, than to another, and consequently there must be somewhat in men, whereby
one does move God to mercy before another; and what is that, but that spark of
Good? Notwithstanding this inference holds good only ordinarily, and does not
infer, but that God extraordinarily may be pleased out of his free will and
pleasure to confer bounties and mercies upon those to whom he will be
bountiful and merciful.

XVI. 5. It is a simple Question to demand, Whether the will is free at that
instant, when it acts; which is as much, as if you enquired, Whether the act
of the will were free. Certainly, there can be no freedom allotted to the act
or effect of an efficient: for that follows necessarily. Posita causa ponitur
effectus. The cause being stated, the effect is also stated. By the act of the
will I mean the consent of the will, or the last execution of it: which is
named Actus imperatus. But if the Question be understood De actu eliciendo,
then no doubt, but the will is free at the same instant, when it acts: for
when would it be free else, were it not when it acts? This Query may be
apprehended thus, Whether the will is free: that is, Whether it does not act
necessarily e suppositione. Necessitas e suppositione is, through which the
will cannot act otherwise than it acts, when it does act. According to this
supposition it does act necessarily: Nam impossible est idem simul esse and
non esse: For it is impossible, that a thing should be, and not be at the same
instant. Nevertheless this does not clip any whit from the freedom of man's
will: for freedom of the will is properly in actum eliciendo, and in actum
imperando, but not in actu elicito, vel imperato: that is, before the act is
consented unto: for the will, before she consents to any act, can determinate
it freely to either opposite. In short, the will is free in its faculty, but
its acts are necessary.

I. THe precedent Dispute touching Free Will, is not so much held among natural
men, as between them, who conceive themselves to be gifted. As for the first, I
have already endeavored to satisfy them. And as for these last, they
alleging sacred Texts for their opinions, plead with more force than the
former: Wherefore it will not be amiss to examine their Arguments, and
afterward to produce such others, as most orthodox Divines do urge for the
proof of their tenants.

The first Scripture, which they seem to produce against us, is that in the
Prove. 16. 9. A man's heart devises his way; but the Lord directs his steps.
And in Chap. 21. 1. The Kings heart is in the hand of the Lord, as the Rivers
of water: he turns it whither soever he will. And in the next foregoing
Chapter, verse. 24. Man's goings are of the Lord; how can a man then understand
his own way?

Jer. 10. 23. O Lord, I know that the way of man is not in himself, it is not
in man that walks to direct his steps.

Phil. 2. 13. For it is God, which works in you both to will and to do, of
his good pleasure.

II. In answer to these, I confess, they are most undoubted truths; but they
are so far from making against us, that they prove part of what I stated in
the foregoing Chapter. Without God, we cannot act, will, or live: that is,
through our selves alone, and without God's ordinary concurrence with us: so
that Solomon says well, That man may devise his way, that is, God has given
man a power of Acting, But the Lord directs his steps; that is, he has not
given man so absolute a power, but that he needs God's ordinary concurrence. So
St Paul: God works in you both to will and to do: that is, has given us a
will and an essence, through which we do act; and God does conservate us in
that will and essence; for without his continual influence we cannot abide in
our being, or actions. But that, which they ought to prove, is, that God's
concurrence with man in his actions takes away his free will.

III. They may also oppose against the 1. subconclus. of the 1. conclus. in the
ninth Chapter, to wit, that moral good is absolutely evil. Romans 8. 7. Because
the carnal mind is enmity against God, etc. But moral good is effected by them,
who are carnally minded: Therefore it is enmity against God, that is absolutely
evil.

Romans 14. 23. For whatsoever is not of faith is sin: But moral good is not of
faith. Ergo, It is a sin or evil.

Matthew. 15. 9. But in vain do they worship me, teaching for Doctrines the
commandments of men. But moral good acts are only such, as the Doctrine of man
teaches: Therefore they are in vain, and evil.

IV. I answer to the first, and except against the Major, which is, What ever
proceeds from a carnal mind is absolutely evil. I distinguish, that evil is
twofold: 1. Evil in particular (Malum in particulari) which is effected from
an evil individual, or particular man. 2. Evil in common (Malum in communi) or
absolute evil, which is evil in it self, and is evil if performed by any man,
whether good or evil. Take my Solution thus: What ever proceeds from a carnal
minded man, is evil in particular relatively, as it proceeds from him, because
it is from an evil man in particular: But this evil in particular does not make
that evil in common, that is, evil to all. For example: eating and drinking in
an evil man, or what ever an evil man does is evil: but because eating and
drinking is evil in an evil man, it does not follow that eating and drinking is
evil to all, so as to extend also to good men; now, eating and drinking, and
what ever an evil man does, is evil, because he eats and drinks unworthily and
ungratefully, in not acknowledging God to be the Creator of the food, which is
set before him, and in not returning thanks for it, 1 These. 5. 18. So that I
say, whatever an evil man does is evil, because he does it unworthily. Hence I
may deny the Minor, and say, That a moral good act, which is effected by an
evil man, is evil in particular, nevertheless it abides moral good, that is,
good in common, Tit. 1. 15. Wherefore this concludes nothing against my
assertion; viz. That a natural man can do a moral good act; that is, if he be a
good natural or moral man: for it is possible to a natural man to be good and
evil, and yet be natural.

V. As to the second, I deny the Minor: Because moral good in a good natural
man is of faith, yet not of entire faith: for he believes that God gave him
his being, and power of acting: He believes in God, that he will supply him in
all defects. Of this more elsewhere. So that the Major is most true: for
whatever is not of faith, is sin. All our actions must be good, that is, such
as God does require from us: But if we do not believe God or believe in him, we
cannot perform such actions, as are pleasing to him: for in not believing him
is to rob God of all his Attributes, of his Mercy, Goodness, Power, etc.
therein they make God a liar; and no wonder then, if men's actions are evil in
God's sight, when they perform them without faith.

The last Objection does require little else for answer, than what was made to
the first.

VI. Further, there are other Texts offered, arguing that man has no free will
to do good or evil. That he has no free will to do good is proved by the 6th
Chapter of Genesis 5. verse. And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in
the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only
evil continually.

Genesis 8. 21. For the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth.

Romans 7. 18. For I know that in me dwells no good thing.

Job 15. 16. How much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinks
iniquity like water, 1 Cor. 6. 19. Eccles. 7. 20. Hence they conclude, that man
does always act evil, and consequently has no free will to good.

VII. I answer, that these Texts do not imply man in general, that is, all men,
but only wicked men, or the most part of men. I prove it. Were all men employed
by these Texts, then there never were any good men: but there were many good
men then, as Moses, Abraham, etc. Therefore all men are not employed by the said
Texts.

2. And particularly to the first Text: I say, that there were many men (but
they were not natural: for had they been natural they could not have been so
perverse as quite to have forgotten God and to have denied him) who were
preternaturally evil: that is, confirmd Atheists, who plainly denied God's
Essence, or Existence. No doubt these cannot do a good act, or think a good
thought; because they act and think with an entire and absolute unbelief:
Wherefore it is a certain moral saying, that none can do good without faith.

Again, That man has no free will to evil, is inferred by that Scripture of
the 7th to the Romans: For the good, that I would do, I do not; but the evil,
which I would not, that I do.

Jer. 13. 23. Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the Leopard his spots? then
may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.

Hence they infer, that a man acts evil necessarily. In the first place, the
Question is not of an evil action, but of a free will to will good and evil:
Wherefore the first quotation makes for us: That a man does will good, although
he does not always act it: for says he, The good, which I would do, I do not,
Here the Apostle speaks of himself, as he is a natural man, for as otherwise no
question he could will good and do good. If as a natural man, then a natural
man can will good, although he does not act that good, which he wills; the
Reason hereof the Apostle does immediately after express in these words; I
find then a law, that when I would do good, evil is present with me; and a
little after: But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of
my mind, etc. Which amounts to this, that man in a natural state has a
free will to good and evil, yet much more to evil; because the will is moved by
a twofold principle. 1. By it self, when it does represent a certain object to
it self without being moved by the inclination of the body. 2. By the
inclination of the body, which is a strong appetite, which men are subjected
unto through the forcible propensities of their body's: Yea oftentimes this
proves so strong, that it easily bends the will to its aim. Now, when the
will is moved through it self without being incited by the appetite of the
body, it does and can do good, and leave it.

VIII. The second Scripture proves the impossibility of Good in Atheists, or
in any without the ordinary concurss of God.

IX. There may be farther urged, That a natural man naturally has no faith,
and consequently cannot do a good act. Romans 10. 17. So then, faith comes by
hearing, and hearing by the word of God: Wherefore a natural man cannot
believe, because he does not hear the word of God.

I answer, That the Apostle speaks of the extraordinary means of faith, and not
of the ordinary. A natural man then believes naturally, or by ordinary means.
Or thus, The word of God is either written, or imprinted in men's hearts: I say
then, that in the first sense faith does come by attending and harkening to the
word of God, which is imprinted in all men's hearts, except in Atheists, in
whose hearts the Law of God is quite blotted out.

Phil. 1. 29. For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to
believe on him, etc. Ergo, Faith is not natural.

I answer, That faith through Christ is given, and is supernatural; but faith,
whereby we believe there is a God, and that he is merciful, and therefore will
find a means to save us, is natural: Although we cannot actually know or
believe the assigned means, whereby he will save us. Wherefore there is only a
partial faith in natural men, and not a complete and entire faith: for they
cannot believe naturally in Christ, unless it be given to them from God, as
the Text does evidently express. Many more are produced: as that of Acts 16.
14. Romans 10. 9. Heb. 12. 2. All which may be easily answered from what has
been explained just now.

X. It is time, that I should prepare to defend my own Positions with the same
force, as was used by them of the contrary opinion. That there is a free will
of doing good and evil in natural men, I prove by the 1 Cor. 7. 37.
Nevertheless he, that standfast in his heart having no necessity, but has
power over his own will, and has decreed so in his heart, that he will keep
his virgin, does well. First, the Apostle teaches that a man does not act
necessarily (having no necessity) but contingently, that is, voluntarily.
Secondly, That he has a free will: What is to have a power over his will else,
but to enjoy a freedom of will; and that either in acting or not acting; and
not only so, but in acting good or evil, and quoad specificationem actus: as
expressly in keeping of his virgin, which is a good act.

XI. Acts 5. 4. Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was
sold, was it not in thine own power? Here is particularly employed a free will
of doing evil or good. Either Ananias might have given the whole price of the
possession, or part. In choosing to give a part under pretext of the whole, he
chose evil: or otherwise he might have chosen to give the whole, and so might
have chose good; for it was in his own power, as the Text holds forth.

XII. Deuteronomy. 30. 11. For this commandment, which I command thee this day, is not
hidden from thee, neither is it far off. It is not in Heaven, nor beyond the
Seas, that thou should say, who shall go up for us to Heaven, and bring it
to us? or, Who shall go beyond the Seas for us, and bring it unto us, that we
may hear and do it? But (says Moses) the Word is very nigh unto thee, in thy
mouth, and in thy heart, that thou may do it. What is more plain, then that
hereby is intended a free will, which a man has of doing good or evil.

XIII. Prove. 6. 5. Deliver thy self as a Roe from the hand of the hunter, and
as a bird from the hand of a fowler. This holds forth, that a man can deliver
himself from evil, yet not without God's concurss.

Psalm. 94. 8. Understand ye brutish among the people: and ye fools, when will
ye be wise? Ergo, A natural man has a power of understanding, if he will; or
else may refuse it. Or an ignorant man has a will of being wiser and knowing;
or of rejecting wisdom and knowledge.

Matthew. 23. 37. How often would I have gathered thy children together, even as
a Hen gathers her chickens under her wings, and ye would not: Ergo, Man had a
will of coming to God: for other ways God would have called upon them in vain,
which is impossible. The same may be inferred from Prove. 1. 24. Isa. 1. 19. If
ye be willing and obedient; ye shall eat the good of the Land, but if ye refuse
and rebel, etc. Ergo, Man can will and refuse. Rev. 3 20. Isa. 65. 12. Eccles.
15. 14. Zech. 1, etc.

XIV. The next thing, I come to prove, is, that man has a spark or remnant of
good in him. Romans 2. 14. For when the Gentiles, which have not the Law, do by
nature the things contained in the Law: these having not the Law are a Law to
themselves. Which shows the work of the Law written in their hearts, their
conscience bearing witness, etc. What is here meant by doing by nature the
things contained in the Law, but that a man naturally has a remnant of Good in
him (for how could he other ways do the things of the written Law?) through
which he may know the Law, and does what the Law commands, and has a
conscience bearing witness. This Text makes good my distinction, that there is
a twofold Law, one expressed or written; and the other impressed in men's
hearts, or the Law of nature. The same we have also in Ezekiel. 18. 21. Luc. 13. 5.

Romans 1. 19, 20, 21. Because that which may be known of God is manifest in
them: for God has showed it unto them. What can be more clear?

XV. I do farther prove, That a natural man cannot do a Theologick good act
through himself, and being only assisted with the ordinary concurss of God. A
theologick good act is, which does fully and entirely satisfy and please God.
There is also a partial theological good act, which differs from the other in
degree, and pleases or satisfies God only partially: as for instance, Moral
good is a partial theologick good, because it does incompleatly and partially
agree with the will of God.

Act. 11. 18. When they heard these things, they held their peace, and
glorified God, saying, then has God also to the Gentiles granted repentance
unto life.

2 Cor. 7. 10. For godly sorrow works repentance to salvation, not to be
repented of, but the sorrow of the world works death.

Phil. 1. 6. Being confident of this very thing, that he which has begun a
good work in you, will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ.

All which allegations testify, That man, with God's ordinary concurss only,
cannot do a theologick good act. For the first Text declares, That God grants
repentance unto life to the Gentiles. The next confirms, That God works
repentance to salvation. The last manifestly shows, That God does begin and
continue a good work in us. By good work is understood a complete and
theologick good work. If then man cannot do a theologick good act without
repentance unto life or salvation, which is through God's extraordinary
concurrence, he cannot do a theologick good act through himself, and by God's
ordinary assistance only.

Man being assisted with God's extraordinary concurrence has a free will of
doing a theologick good act. Tit. 3. 8. This is a faithful saying, and these
things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they, which have believed in
God, might be careful to maintain good works. Here it appears, that to
maintain good works (which good is theologick good) man must believe in God:
and what is it else to believe in God, but to confide and hope in God's
extraordinary assistance and concurss. Ephesians. 2. 1. Ephesians. 1. 5.

XVI. I remember I asserted in the subconclusion of the first conclusion, in
the ninth Chapter, that man, when assisted by God's extraordinary concurss,
has still a free will, not to extreme contraries; but a free will of election,
that is a freedom of making choice of one good thing before another.

That a supernatural man has no free will to extreme contraries, that is, to
do theologick evil and theologick good. I prove it, Heb. 6. 16, 17, 18. 1 John
5. 9, 10. John 5. 24. Ephesians. 1. 13, 14. 2 Cor. 1. 21, 22. Romans 8. 16. John 10.
27, 28, 29. Matthew. 24. 24. 2 Timothy 2. 19. Romans 11. 29. Esaias 42. 3. Romans 8. 1,
38, 39. Phillip. 1. 6. The Texts, which are produced by Bellarmin against this
position are Marc. 4. 15. Luc. 8. 13. John 15. 2. Hebr. 6. 4, 5, 6. Hebr. 10.
26. 2 Pet. 21, 22. All these instances prove only that initiates, hypocrites
and superficial Saints have deflected, but not that confirmed and truly
profound Saints have fallen off and done the worst evil. Besides, them sins or
backslidings were not theologick evils, but moral: so that, had they been
confirmed Saints, it would have concluded nothing against us.

A supernatural man (supernatural is, when a man can act supernaturally through
the extraordinary concurss of God, that, which a natural man cannot act
naturally by the ordinary concurss of God) has a partial free will to moral
evil and moral good: but he does moral evil accidentally, and moral good per
se, and is more inclined to moral good, than to moral evil. Herein does a
supernatural man differ from a natural man, in that the one sins with a
partial reluctance of his will, and accidentally through the forcible and
mighty inclination or drawing of his flesh, Rom 16. 12. the other commits sin
per se with his whole will, and also with a pleasure. Thus did David, Solomon,
and Peter slide back, and committed moral evil; yet it was with a partial
reluctance of will, with a fear and trouble, far from doing it with a pleasure
or entire will. After the same tenor are these Texts to be interpreted,
Proverbs 24. 1. 1 John 1. 8. expressly Romans 1. 32. Who knowing the judgment of
God (that they who commit such things are worthy of death) not only do the
same, but have a pleasure in them that do them. A supernatural man has an
entire free will of Election of doing a theological good act: for a
supernatural man may pray with faith, praise God with faith, help the poor with
faith, etc. All which are theologick good acts, in choosing of which a man
imployeth his free will, John 8. 31, 32, 36. Romans 14. 2, 3.

XVII. After this there remains still to prove, that the means, whereby God's
extraordinary concurrence is procured, is in man himself, and adheres to his
free will. Zech. 1. 3. Therefore say unto them, thus says the Lord of Hosts,
Turn ye unto me, says the Lord of Hosts, and I will turn unto you. Had man not
had a free will and means in himself of procuring Gods assistance, it would
have been said in vain: Turn ye unto me. But that is impossible. Ergo, A man
has a free will and means in himself of turning unto God. To turn to God is to
apply our selves to him, and to beg his extraordinary assistance; and so I
prove, that prayer is the first means, whereby we turn to God.

In the first place, turning to God cannot be to believe savingly in him, or to
serve God as he requires: because we of our selves cannot believe savingly,
before God does assist us in an extraordinary manner. Therefore God by
commanding us to turn to him, commands us to pray to him for his assistance.
But this is apparent by other Scriptures, as Psalm. 15. 14, 15. Psalm. 55. 23.
Deuteronomy. 4. 29. Matthew. 7. 7. Luke 11. 13. James 1. 5. 1 Pet. 5. 7.

XVIII. Man being thus enabled by God's extraordinary concurss, the Question
will be, Whether the actions, which man so performs, are to be taken for the
actions of God or of man. Divines usually say, That such actions are wrought
from man, but man does not work them of himself; that is, man does them actions
from himself, but he does not do them of himself alone, but by God's
extraordinary assistance to him. Wherefore the actions thus effected from man
are rather to be called the actions of man, than the actions of God; because
man is the nearest efficient of them actions. The sacred Texts appear to hold
forth the same. Mat. 5. 16. Let your light so shine before men, that they may
see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in Heaven. Here you may
observe, that good works, or actions effected from good men, are called man's
good works, and not Gods.

The like expression you have in 1 John 3. 3, 10. Good actions are wrought from
man, but not of man. 2 Cor. 3. 5. Not that we are sufficient of our selves to
think any thing as of our selves; but our sufficiency is of God: The Apostle
says here, That our sufficiency is of God; that is, our power of acting is of
God. Gal. 2. 20. Romans 9. 16. So then, it is not of him that wills, nor him
that runs, but of God that shows mercy. Wherefore man cannot will or do a
theological good act of himself (although he may from himself) but of God.

XIX. Before I leave this controversy, it is requisite to examine that
Scripture of the ninth to the Romans, which seems to evert most of what has
been posed in this Chapter, verse. 13, 14, 15, 16. As it is written, Jacob have
I loved, but Esau have I hated. What shall we say then? is there
unrighteousness with God? God forbid. For he says to Moses, I will have
mercy, on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion, on whom I will
have compassion. So then it is not of him that wills, nor of him that
runs, but of God that shows mercy.

1. Hence they may argue. If God hated Esau, then he hated also all his
actions, and consequently hated his prayers: Wherefore there was no means left
in Esau, whereby to procure God's extraordinary concurss. Ergo, All men have
not the means in them, whereby, etc. This also proves, that Esau had no spark
of good in him, and therefore God did totally hate him; for had he had any good
in him, God could not have hated that good.

2. Jacob have I loved. Ergo, Jacob had never any evil in him: for had he had
evil in him God could not have loved him.

3. The Scripture makes enquiry, Whether it is unrighteousness with God to
hate Esau and love Jacob. Ergo, It is not severe, that God should hate one, and
love another; to damn one justly, and to save another Gratis velex gratia.

4. Moses says, that God will have mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom
he will he hardneth. Ergo, Man has no free will to do good.

In answer to the first inference, I deny the sequel. For it does not follow,
that God, because Esau had no good in him, or means to procure God's favor,
hated Esau; but God hated Esau for not using the means, which was in him. Romans
2. 15. Here may be urged that God hated Esau from all eternity. Ergo, Esau
could never have had the means to salvation. I deny the consequence. God hated
Esau from all eternity, because he fore-knew his actions and intents from all
eternity. Here may be demanded, How God can foreknow man's actions, since they
are contingent; were they necessary, he might. Let the Scripture answer you in
this Romans 9. 20. We are not to dive into God's manner of working farther, than
he has revealed to us, and nevertheless we must believe, that all things are
possible to God, and that he is Elohim, Heb. 1. 3. Luc. 1. 37. Phil. 3. 21. 2 Chronicles. 20. 5. Matthew. 19 26. Esaias 9. 6. Jer. 32. 18. Genesis 17. 1. and 35. 11.
Ruth 1. 20, 21. 2 Cor. 6. 18. Revel. 1. 8. and 4. 8. 1 Timothy 6. 9. Neither is it
a legal inference, that because God hated Esau; therefore Esau had no remnant
of good in him: he might have had good in him, and yet God have hated him; not
for having that good, but for not exercising it. God might also have hated Esau
from all eternity for his sins and evil actions, which God foresaw from all
eternity; and yet he might have had a principle of Good in him.

As for the second Argumentation, I deny the consequence: for it does not
follow that Jacob had never no evil in him, because God did love him: for God
loved David, and yet it is apparent enough, that David had evil in him, Romans 7.
24. Paul calls himself wretched; yet it is certain, that God loved him. God
pardons their sins, because they are committed by them, not with an entire
will, but with a reluctance, Romans 7. 20, 23.

To the third I answer: It is no severity in God to love one and hate the
other, supposing that God can foreknow all man's evil actions; and therefore
hates him. He may also foreknow his good actions, and come to love him from
all eternity: yet not because his actions are absolutely good in themselves,
Luc. 17. 10. Romans 11. 35, 36. 1 John 1. 8. Esaias 64. 6. Psalm. 130. 3. but
because God out of his grace and mercy does impute his actions to him for
righteousness, Romans 4. 21, 22, 23, 24. Ephesians. 2. 8, 9. Phil. 3. 9. Col. 3. 24.
2 Timothy 1. 16. But it would be severe should God hate us from all eternity, if
we should falsely suppose that God did not foreknow our actions: so that herein
you conclude nothing against me.

If (in the fourth place) God shows mercy to those only, to whom he will,
and hardneth their hearts, whose he pleases to harden: it will prove in vain
to man to work good works, or to will good, neither can he will or do good
without God's grace and mercy. All this I grant to be a certain truth, that we
can do no good work without God's grace and mercy: and no doubt but God has
also a free will to confer grace and mercy on whom he pleases, and harden
those whom he pleases to harden, working all things according to the counsel
of his own will, Ephesians. 1. 5, 6, 11. Revel. 4. 11. Psalm. 135. 6. Psalm. 33. 9.
Matthew. 8. 2, 3. Nevertheless this is no ground, why we should argue, that man
has no free will, because God has a free will: we rather ought to surmise the
contrary; That man has a free will, because God has a free will, Genesis 1. 26.
God does work in us to will and to do of his good pleasure or will, Phil. 2.
13. Ergo, God's will does not abolish our wills: but his will is, that we should
have a will. But possibly you do farther urge this argument by subducting
Predestination from thence, thus: If man is predestined, Ergo, He has no
free will of doing good; for a free will in him would be in vain. This Text
does apparently teach God's eternal Decree, Predestination or Ordination to
save some, and damn others: But for what? for to manifest his Glory, Mercy and
Justice, Acts 13. 48. And as many as were ordained to eternal life, believed,
Isa. 46. 10. Mal 3. 6. Hereunto I answer, that God's Predestination is in no
wise coactive; for, were it so, then Predestination and Fate of the Stoics
would not differ: What is fate, but an irresistible and forced impulse upon
man, through which he does necessarily and unavoidably perform all his actions,
and especially such, which concern his life and death, his ruin or advancement
in politic affairs, his marriage, or any other extraordinary change of life;
for in all these fate was most taken notice of, and therefore more particularly
attributed to them cases; Although fate in general denoted an unchangeable and
necessary ordination upon all beings. Whether this ordination was imposed by
Jupiter as the Poets feigned, or caused from a necessary bending and disposing
of the Heavens, and its constellations, as the Chaldeans thought, does not much
concern us in this Treatise.

Cicero was not a little puzzeld in expounding, how free will might be allowed:
and yet not be repugnant to Gods foreknowledge; for thought he, does God
foreknow our actions, then man must act necessarily, and consequently infers
the truth of Fate; but since he could not grant a Fate over men, because he saw
they acted contingently, therefore he did impiously rob God of his
foreknowledge. Hence says Austin. de Civ. D. Lib. 5. cap. 9. Atque it a, dum
vult facere liberos, fecit sacrilegos, and so since he endeavors to make men
free-willers, he makes them commit sacrilege. As for this doubt, it is little
touched upon by Christians, who certainly know, that God fore-knoweth
contingent things, as contingent, and to fall out contingently: Necessary
things as necessary, and to fall out necessarily, Psalm 33. 14. 1 Samuel 10. 9,
26. Prove. 21. 1. Exodus 12. 13. Prove. 16. 33. Matthew. 10. This subject is very
well treated of by Anselmus in his Book of God's foreknowledge and
predestination. This by the way. And now I return to prove, that God's
Predestination is in no wise coactive upon the will of man: for then the will
of man would be a not willing, Voluntas esset noluntas. God is most just in
predestinating man through Election, and of his grace and mercy to salvation,
Ephesians 1. 5, 6. and in predestinating others through reprobation, and of his
justice, to damnation, 2 Cor. 13. 5. Because his predestination is founded upon
his foreknowledge: God therefore fore-knowing the evil, wherein man is
enhardened, does predestinate him to damnation. This I prove. God damneth man
of his justice, and God's justice has a particular respect to man's evil
actions. Wherefore it is of God's justice, and for man's sin, or evil
actions, that he is damned. That God's justice has a particular respect to
judge and punish man with damnation for his sins, the Scripture does evidently
testify, Luc. 12. 47, 48. And that servant, which knew his Lords will, and
prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with
many stripes. Ergo, Man is punished for not doing the Lord's will: and not
because he was predestined without God's foreknowledge of his evil and
unbelief, Matthew. 11. 21. Mat. 25. 41, 42. Here Christ pronounces the sentence
of everlasting damnation against the wicked, because they had not done his will
in feeding the hungry, and clothing the naked, Genesis 2. 17. Deuteronomy. 7. 26. Exodus
32. 33.

So then, if God does damn man only for his trespasses and sins, he does
also for the same reason predestinate him to damnation.

Again, Were God's predestination the sole and first moving cause of man's
reprobation, then Adam could have had no free will of remaining in the state of
innocence, or of deflecting to the state of sin; but must necessarily and
coactively have deflected to the state of depravation, because God had
predestinate him to it: This assertion is impious: Ergo, God's predestination
is not the first moving cause of man's reprobation. What? should God
predestinate man to damnation without fore-knowing his guilt, or without being
thereunto moved through the foreknowledge of his sin, then these Texts would
be written to no purpose. Hos. 6. 6. Ephesians. 4. 22, 23, 24, etc. John 3. 16, 17,
18. John 3. 36. Romans 9. 22, 23. Ezekiel. 33. 11. As I live, says the Lord God, I
have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his
way and live: Turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O
house of Israel? Wherefore it is not of God's purpose to damn any, unless
being moved to it of his justice through their unbelief.

Likewise the Scripture does reveal, that predestination to life eternal is of
God's grace and justice, being thereunto moved by the says of the righteous,
Mat. 9. 22. Romans 4. 20, 21. Ephesians. 3. 12. Mat. 9. 2. Gal. 2. 20. Ephesians. 2. 8, 9.

First, Summarily I say, that God's Will, Decree, and Predestination, is the
efficient cause of Reprobation and Election: his grace, mercy and justice, are
the moving causes: Man's unbelief and belief are the objects of this motion, in
which, or upon which, and by which the forementioned moving causes are moved:
which objects God fore-knowing determinates man's salvation or damnation from
all eternity: Wherefore we may observe, that in many places of Scripture, where
predestination is held forth, that God's foreknowledge of man's belief or
unbelief does precede. Romans 8. 29. For whom he did foreknow he also
predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son. What can be more evident?

Secondly, Faith or good works (for says it self is the best of works, and the
fountain of all good works) are the means, whereby we are saved; yet it is not
faith or good works, which d^ meritoriously or efficiently save us, but God is
the efficient cause of our salvation. Romans 4. 6. So likewise unbelief (which is
the worst of works, and the original of all evil works and sins) or Atheismis
the means, through which we are damned; yet it is not that, which is the
principal moving cause of our damnation, but God's justice, which does reject
and predestinate man to damnation. Romans ^. 8.

Thirdly, God's will is either absolute, whereby he can will all things; and
this is concomitant to Gods absolute power, whereby he can do all things,
although they never are effected; for if he can do them, he has also a power
of willing them, although he does not will all them things, which he can will:
or his ordained will, whereby he wills that, which he does will. This
ordained will is unchangeable: hence God is said to have loved, because he
loved: that is, when God wills to love, he cannot but love, because he
wills it; and therefore his will is unchangeable. God's ordained will is,
that man shall be saved through his belief: and therefore cannot but save a
believer, because his will endures for ever, and is unchangeable. Wherefore I
said in the first Assertion, That man's belief moved God's mercy: because God
has willed it through his ordained will; otherwise were it not for this, what
could man's belief avail in meriting salvation? for at the best, we are but
unprofitable servants, Luc. 17. 10. and so man's unbelief moves God's justice
to damn him, because God wills justice. Wherefore I conceive that belief and
unbelief are remote moving causes, as from us, by which we move God's mercy and
justice: And that God's mercy and justice are moving causes as from himself.

Fourthly, Man has then a power of disposing and preparing himself partially
to, and for the admission of God's extraordinary concurss, and to a conversion
from the state of sin to the state of grace; for to what effect or end would
all the reachings of Ministers serve? All their exhortations, their labor and
pains would be to no purpose.

1. They strive to bend men into a care for their salvation, by working that
carnal security out of them, according to that of Acts 2. 37. and 16. 33.

2. They lay the Law of God open to men, in quickening the print of it in their
hearts, which was almost deaded, and exing them to examine the course of their
lives, James 1. 23, 24, 25.

3. The immediate effect of this search is the conviction of a man's conscience,
Romans 1. 20. and 2. 1. Romans 11. 32.

4. This conviction of conscience brings them to a desperation of their
salvation, they finding that ^mp^^nesse and unablenesse in themselves, Romans 7.
9, 11, 13.

5. This begets a humiliation in their hearts, grieving for their sins,
fearing the guilt, and dreading the punishment, and so they are brought to a
confession of their sins, Mat. 9. 12.

All these effects are produced through the insight of man into his own heart,
where all men contain the moral Law, and may through the light of Nature, and
God's ordinary Grace, or ordinary Call unfold it in the same sense, which the
quoted Texts do express.

CHAP. XI. Of the Command of the Will.
1. Whether the Will can be forced. 2. What elicited and imperated acts are. 3.
What command the Will exercises over the inferior facultin What a politic
and despotick command is. 4. That the irascible and appetitive faculty are
under a politic obedience to the Will. 5. That the locomotive faculty is not
always under a servile obedience to the will. 6. That the Will does not
command over the practick understanding.


I. I Have digressed somewhat beyond my bounds in the last Chapter, in
alleging Scripture to prove many fundamental assertions of this Treatise; the
which although I ought to have performed by reason only, nevertheless to
gratify some (whose education teaches them not to give credit to any reason,
unless confirmed by Scripture) I contracted the forementioned quotations in
one little space. And now to keep on my road: There remains one Question more
relating to the freedom of will, which I shall first endeavor to answer, and
then go on in adding what is requisite. The Question is, Whethen the will can
be forced. This is a strange kind of doubt, Whether the will, when it does not
will (for when it is forced, it does act against its will) be a will: However
this seems an absurd query, if understood in so many plain words; yet
supposing that act to be forced or against the will, which is willed through
the will, but with a reluctance, and foreknowledge of inconvenience thereon
ensuing; the Question may be conceived in a safe meaning.

The will is termed forced, when it does will through compulsion or impulsion,
or through a positive or privative violence (as others explain it) without
which it would not have willed that, which otherwise it willed. The Question
might rather be proposed thus; Whether the will, when it is forced, is free, or
acts freely: for no doubt the will of man can be forced in all her acts,
whatever Authors say to the contrary. I prove it. Man can be forced in his
imperated acts. Ergo, A man can also be forced in his elicited acts, because
there is no imperated act, but it derives from an elicited act; for it is the
elicited act, which commands the other act.

Here may then be enquired, Wherein a forced elicited act differs from an
absolute free act. I answer, That both these acts proceed from the will with a
consent; but that, which the will acts with an absolute freedom, it acts
without any remorse, and with an entire consent: That, which the will acts,
when she is forced, she acts with a remorse and partial reluctance, for to
avoid a greater inconvenience or evil; and were it not for that, she would not
have acted it.

The will cannot properly be said to be forced through a privative violence,
because the will does not act at all, when she is hindered.

II. The acts of the will, according to Moralists, are either elicited, or
imperated. An elicited act of the will is, when she does act within her self,
by proposing the goodness of an object, and consents to the covering or
rejecting of it. The imperated act of the will is, whereby she does execute
that, which she had concluded and agreed to by the elicited act, in commanding
the inferior faculties.

III. The command, which the will exercises over the obeying faculties, is
politic, or controlable. The obeying faculties are the internal and external
senses, the locomotive faculty, the irascible and appetible faculty. I prove
it. The internal senses obey the will from a politic obedience; for a man
wills ofttimes not to think, or to remember this or that thing, which
nevertheless does force into his mind: Besides, the fancy works in a dream
without being commanded by the will: Wherefore the wills command is not
despotick, but politic.

The external senses do not obey the will from a despotick obedience, because
the will frequently cannot per se hinder them in their functions: as for
instance, she cannot at all times hinder the hearing from perceiving a noise,
or the sent from smelling a bad sent, etc.

IV. The irascible and appetitive faculty obey the will politickly, because our
natures are ofttimes prone to envy, anger, or revenge, when we would not be so.
So our natures Not as we are like unto men, but rather unto beasts.
are as often propense to covet evil objects, which our will does contradict.

V. The locomotive faculty does frequently refuse a servil obedience to the
will; for in wearinesses and convulsions she is rebellious and unable: Besides,
the locomotive faculty being in some cases more obedient to the sensitive
appetite, she obeys it, before she obeys the will. Lastly, The locomotive
faculty is oftentimes at work in a dream, and at other times, when the will
does not command her; and thence it is evident, that the locomotive faculty
does not obey the will from a despotick obedience.

VI. It is absurd to affirm, That the will commands the practick
understanding; for it is the same thing, as if you said, That the will
commanded her self, the will and practick understanding being one and the same.

CHAP. XII. Of Voluntary and Involuntary.
1. That the Understanding, as it is speculative and practick, is the internal
principle of the ultimate and intermediate actions. That God or Angels are
improperly said to be external principles. That God is the coefficient of man's
actions. How Angels, whether good or evil, Wizards and Witches concur to the
specification of man's actions. 2. What a humane action is. 3. That it is
absurd to assert man to do a thing ignorantly. 4. Whether evils of omission
through ignorance are to be termed involuntary. 5. How humane actions are
divided.


I. HItherto we have declared the internal principle of man (namely the
understanding, as it is speculative and practick) through which he acts in
order to the attaining the Summum Bonum, and arriving to his last and ultimate
action, the immediate fruits of which is the greatest happiness. Furthermore,
we are not only to state the understanding to be the internal principle of our
last and ultimate action, but also of all intermediate actions, and of such as
are called humane, moral, or voluntary actions. We need not augment the number
of internal principles, by adding Habits to them, these being supposed to alter
the forestated principles accidentally only, and not essentially. How Habits'
are acquired, and how intended, remitted, and corrupted, we have set down
elsewhere. Neither are God or Angels properly said to be external principles,
since all principles strictly are required to be internal. But God may be
justly termed the coefficient of the actions of man, since God works in us to
will and to do. Angels, whether good or evil, Wizards and Witches cannot concur
efficiently to the effecting of humane actions, to which an infinite power is
only sufficient, whereas they, consisting of a limited power, are therefore
rendered incapable. They may concur to the specification of an act, as
persuasive causes in bending man's will to this or that act, by changing the
fancy, in stirring up the humors and spirits of the brain, whereby it may
represent objects otherwise than they are, or by presenting objects through a
false image or representation, or by changing the external sensories. Whence we
may observe, that it is not in the Devils power to make or force us to do a
thing against our wills, but that we may discover, resist, and refuse his
deceitful motions; or otherwise we might be justly thought excusable;
wherefore, if we do at any time commit evil through the persuasion of an evil
spirit, we must not only accuse the wicked spirit, but our selves also.

After our discourse upon the will, there remains alone to appose a word or two
touching humane actions.

II. Humane actions, otherwise called moral and voluntary, are such, as are
effected by man, as far as he is a man, or are produced by his will, or
practick understanding. Wherefore whatever man acts with the foreknowledge
and fore-command of his practick understanding is humane and voluntary. A
voluntary action may be purely voluntary and free; or mixed out of a Voluntas,
and Noluntas, that is, willed with a reluctance. The first acception of
Voluntary, Aristotle terms voluntary strictly so called; the latter he
denominates involuntary; but improperly.

III. It is absurd to assert man to do a thing ignorantly, since it is
impossible for a man to do any thing, which he does not foreknow. Wherefore it
must be an error in the Peripateticks to affirm, that man can act an
involuntarium quiddam ex ignorantia, because he acts nothing, but what is
consented unto partially, or totally by his will, which cannot will any thing
(as the Peripatetick definition holds forth) without the foreknowledge of the
understanding. Hence I conclude, that nothing is to be termed involuntary or
mixtly voluntary, unless a man is forced to it violently, or by a cause acting
from without.

IV. Here may be demanded, Whether evils of omission of duties (required by a
Law) committed by man, when he is ignorant of the said Law, are to be termed
involuntary? No certainly, for they are voluntary, in that the omission of an
act is as much an act of the will as the effection of it. But whether such
omissions or commissions, which a man does will, are to be termed evil, in
regard he willed them through ignorance, which had he not been ignorant of he
would not have willed, is to be decided from the circumstances of such actions,
and not from the imputing such actions not to be the actions of man, or not to
be voluntary. Moreover I answer, That no kind of ignorance does make an action
neutral (that is, neither good or evil) and excusable, but an invincible
ignorance. What invincible ignorance and other kinds of ignorances are, I do
wittingly omit the inserting, since they are vulgarly enough known. As for such
circumstances, which are required to render humane actions good or evil, I have
set down in the latter end of this Book.

V. The action of the will is accidentally divided in fruition and intention.
Fruition is the continuated coveting and willing of an object, already before
coveted and now enjoyed. Intention is a mediate coveting of means, whereby to
covet an object immediately, or to arrive to the fruition of it. Intention
contains in it three inferior actions. 1. Election, whereby the practick
understanding does by a preceding deliberation covet one or more objects for a
means out of many. 2. Consent, which is a further coveting of that or them
objects, which it has elected, so as to be confirmed and pleased in that
election. 3. Usus, or Usance, otherwise called execution, which is the
application of the means, now elected and consented unto, to a further action.

CHAP. XIII. Of Natural Faith.
1. That Faith is the sole means, through which we are to attain to our
greatest good. What Faith is. The Definition confirmed by Arguments deduced
from reason. 2. The twofold object of Faith. A proof from reason, that God is
the Creator of man. That God and Nature are one. 3. An enquiry into the end of
man's creation. 4. That man does know the sum of God's Law through the light
of Nature. A summary enumeration of the Law of God, as it is imprinted upon
every man's heart. 5. Moral virtues compared with the moral Law. A
comprehension of all moral virtues.


I Have just now finished my Discourse upon the subject of this Tract; that,
which falls next under our consideration, is the means, through which we are to
attain to our greatest Good and happiness. The sole means is Faith.

Faith is a certain knowledge of God and the Law, and an assurance in, and of
God's mercy and goodness. The genus proximum, and differentia proxima, are
signals, that their Definitum, or thing defined is not an historical or
temporary faith, or says of miracles only, but a justifying and glorifying
faith, necessarily comprehending in it self the three other kinds, as degrees,
by which the soul does gradually ascend to an exalting faith. Among other
School-Divines it goes under the name of an explicit Faith. Fides the same
with the Definitum, deriveth its denomination from fidere, a word not in use
among the later Latinists, whose signification the verb confidere has since
supplied, which is to rest contented and fully satisfied: Wherefore assurance
implying a certain practical knowledge freed from all doubts, and causing this
rest and satisfaction, does justly and properly deserve the place of the Genus
in this Definition.

The certainty, which Faith does bring with it, depends upon the certainty and
necessity of its premises, which being necessary and certain infers a certain
and necessary conclusion. If God is merciful, he will save them, that beg
mercy. But God is merciful, and I do beg mercy. Therefore God will save me.


This Conclusion, as depending upon unchangeable and certain premises, holds
forth, that Faith is an undoubted assurance of God's mercy, and that he will
save a zealous believer. No wonder then, if Faith does create this quietness,
rest, and satisfaction.

Austin. de Civit. Dei, lib. 19. cap. 18. tells us no less: To the Acadamicks
all things are uncertain: but the City of God does quite detest such kind of
doubting, like madness: having a most certain knowledge of them things, which
it comprehends in it is mind and reason.

II. The object, about which Faith is conversant, is double: 1. God, and the
Law. 2. God's infinite mercy and transcendent goodness. This duplicity is
necessary; because, first, we must know our present state: Secondly, how to get
out of that state into a better. Our present state is made known unto us
through knowing God and the Law. The way, whereby to change this state for a
better, is through an assurance in God's mercy and goodness.

A natural man, after having made enquiry, what he is, and finding, that he is
a man, a Rational living creature, above all other creatures in the world, and
of a most excellent and admirable essence, cannot but straight way admire and
search from who, or whence, he had this noble being. Certainly although if he
has never heard of God, or attained to the knowledge of him, yet his reason
will direct him to observe daily experience, which shows him, that every man
descends from his parents, and they from their progenitors, or that man is
continuated by propagation: By the same rule of experience he is also
instructed, that all things in the world are finite, and have a beginning and
ending: If so, then there must be one first cause, from which all Beings derive
their Essence: This cause is an universal cause, by reason that all things have
received their being from it: If all things are derived from this universal
cause, then certainly the race of man had its beginning also thence. Some of
the ruder sort may object, that all things are by nature. In answer to this, I
demand, what they mean by nature? they will reply an universal cause, which
acts most uniformly and unchangeably. Secondly, I demand through what
principle all things are continued? They say, through the same nature. Nature,
say they, acts most wisely and most providently, and has so acted from all
eternity. This is so far from an objection against us, that it is an argument
for us: For by these very words they express God, who is nature (Natura
naturans) and the sole universal cause acting most uniformly, unchangeably
(secundum volunt atem ordinatam) most wisely, providently, from all eternity,
and continuating all things from the beginning, until the ending. Let an
Atheist therefore answer never so perversely concerning the first cause of all
beings, yet nolens volens he does plainly confess, that there is a God,
although under another name of Nature.

III. Man knowing, that God has created him, he cannot but wonder, for what
end. For God (thinks he) acts nothing in vain. He is sure, it is not for to
eat, drink, and live; for were it so, God needed not to have conferred a
reasoning or understanding faculty upon him, because he could have eaten, drunk
and lived without an understanding. The end therefore, for which he was
created, must be that, to what his understanding makes him capable. His
understanding is capable of knowing God, and his Laws, of praising, serving,
obeying God, and living according to his Commandments.

As for his Commandments he will find them written in his heart.

IV. 1. He may easily gather, That there is but one true God, because he is
Almighty, and can work all things: If then there were more Gods than one, it
supposes, that they are not almighties, but must work sociably one with the
other; or if they are almighties, that, as many as are more than one, are in
vain: for one is Almighty, and can do all things; if he can do all things, then
there is nothing remaining for the others to do, who must then be in vain. But
to imagine otherwise is absurd. Ergo, There is but one true God, and all the
others are false gods.

2. God is a Spirit, and therefore will only be worshipped in Spirit. This was
not unknown to the Heathens. Si Deus est animus, nobis ut carmina dicunt,
Hic tibi praecipue sit pura mento colendus.
If God a Spirit be, as most of Poets say,
In purity of mind we must unto him pray.


What a vain thing is it for man to worship an Image? as if God could not
perceive or know our worship without that Image; or as if we could not know God
without an Image. If we can truly make an Image of God, then God is no Spirit,
but an old man, as the Papists picture him.

3. A Lord's servant seldom speaks of him, without naming of him his Lordship,
or his Honor, or tho Right Honorable, and so does reverence and homage his
very name; and no doubt, but a Lord would conceive himself much provoked,
should his servant take his name in vain: much more ought man, who is the
meanest servant of the Lord of Lords name his name with all reverence and
humility; for God is most highly provoked in hearing of his name taken in vain.

4. There is an ordinary manner of serving God, which ought to continue at all
times in doing all things to his glory. God does permit man to do that, which
tends to his conservation; nevertheless at those times we ought to praise God
for giving us strength and means, whereby we are preserved. There is also an
extraordinary manner of serving God, when we for bear from all temporal and
corporeal actions, and abide wholly in spiritual exercises for a day, a week,
or a month. Assuredly this is acceptable to God, and therefore we ought to
repeat it often.

These are the duties which a man may gather are to be performed to God. But
this is not all, there are other duties remaining respecting to ones self and
others. Among others, some are particularly related to us, as our parents; some
in a common and general relation only, as our neighbors.

5. The Duty, which we owe to our parents, nature teaches us, as to honor,
love and obey them.

6. The Duty to our selves and others is, to do what we can to preservate our
selves and our neighbors, not to injure or kill our selves or others: To do to
others, as we would have other do to us. We must shun all envy, anger and
hatred.

7. A man is not to defile himself or another. Modesty, unchaste thoughts,
carnal desires, wanton gestures are by the light of nature adjudged evil and
sinful.

8. We ought to render to every one what is his. We are not to wrong our
neighbors in his goods, houses, cattle, or corn, etc. We must detest cheating,
defrauding, or crafty overreaching of our neighbors, whether by lies, false
measures, else weights, or moneys, and usury, etc.

9. A false oath is unjust and injurious; the like are slanderings, lies and
backbitings, the harboring of bad thoughts of others without a manifest cause.

10. We are not so much as to have the least desire to what is not our own, if
it be to the wrong of another, unless we desire withal to give full
satisfaction and contentment to the owner, which is only possible in unfixt and
untied matters.

V. I have briefly enumerated the contents of the Moral Law, according as it is
engraffed upon all men's hearts. This Law is perfect and complete, because there
is no moral precept belonging to any moral virtue, but is contained herein,
neither is there any vice, but is hereby checked and condemned: Wherefore I
shall compare them together, to wit, moral Virtues with the moral Law.

A virtue is a habit of acting good: on the other side, vice is a habit of
acting evil.

Virtue or vice may be termed moral or theologick according to the act, which
it produces, which is either moral good or evil, or theologick good or evil.

So holiness is a habit of acting according to the Law of God. Sin is a habit
of acting contrary to the Law of God, according it is written in all men's
hearts.

That this Law is known to all men, it appears hence, because all men are
checked by their conscience at one time or another for their sins.

There are four cardinal or principal Virtues: Prudence, Justice, Temperance
and Fortitude.

Prudence is a habit, through which a man is directed in exercising particular
virtues.

Its integrant parts are three. 1. The remembrance of things past. 2. The
knowledge of things present. 3. The foresight of things to come. Thomas
Aquinas counts eight. 1. Memory. 2. Knowledge. 3. Aptness to learn. 4.
Cunningnesse. 5. Reason. 6. Foresight. 7. Circumspection. 8. Caution.

The subjected parts of Prudence are four. 1. Kingly prudence, in governing his
Subjects. 2. Politic prudence of the People, in obeying the Magistrate. 3.
Oeconomical prudence, in governing a family. 4. Military prudence, in ruling an
Army.

The potential parts of prudence are three. 1. Inquiry for means. 2. Judgment
concerning the means invented. 3. Command, that them things be effected, upon
which judgment is past.

Justice is a virtue of giving every one, what is his.

Its integral parts are three. 1. To live honestly. 2. To give every one what
is his. 3. To wrong no man.

The subjected parts of Justice are two. 1. General Justice, through which a
man deals justly with the Commonwealth. 2. Special or particular Justice,
through which a man deals justly with every particular person. Special Justice
is twofold. 1. Commutative Justice, through which a man is just in his trading
with others. 2. Distributive Justice, which is either recompencing every one
for his good deserts; or punishing every one for his crimes: in which there is
observed a Geometrical proportion: and in commutative Justice an Arithmetical
proportion

Right is that, which agrees with the Law or Justice. It is either natural, or
positive: humane, or divine: Ecclesiastic, or civil: written, or not written.

A Law is a rule, command, or precept of Justice containing in it, what is
just, and what ought to be done. There are three conditions required to the
constitution of a Law. 1. Equity. 2. Authority. 3. Promulgation, or the
publishing of it.

A Law is either external, or participated. The participated Law is divided in
Natural, Humane, and Divine.

The Humane Law is either Civil or Canonical.

The Divine Law is divided into the old and new Law.

Temperance is a habit of moderating the senses, particularly the senses of
feeling and tasting.

The integral parts are two. 1. Bashfulnesse. 2. Honesty.

The potential parts are four: Continence, Clemency, Humility and Modesty.

The subjected parts are Abstinence, Sobriety, Chastity, and Shamefac'dnesse.

Fortitude is a virtue in attempting terrible matters.

Its acts are two. 1. To uphold. 2. To go on.

The integral parts of Fortitude are Magnanimity, Magnificence, Patience and
Perseverance.

A man must not only have a bare knowledge of God's Law, or of the moral
Virtues, but also a practick knowledge, that is to know them in himself so as
to practice them

CHAP. XIV. Of Man's Fall, and of Atheism.
1. A rational enquiry into man's primitive estate. The maenner of man's fall.
2. Grounds, whence a man may rationally collect hopes for his restoration. 3.
That Atheism is the worst of sins, and that an Atheist is unable of performing
the least good act. Wherein the goodness of an action does consist, 4. A
Character of an Atheist. That confirmed Atheism is the only sin against the
holy Ghost. A full Discovery of an Atheist.


THe other part of the object of Faith is Gods mercy and goodness: how a
natural man comes to find out God's mercy, I shall instantly demonstrate. Man,
having compared the difficulty of the Law with his unablenesse of performing
obedience to it, cannot rest satisfied or assured, unless relieved and
assisted by these two Attributes of God: for he, being conscious of his pravity
and corrupt state of nature, must imagine, that he was not so created, but good
and blessed; because the Creator is good and blessed, and being left to his
free will, knowing what was good, and what might be evil, he through a wanton
curiosity and alurement of an evil spirit (which spirits were created before
man, and whose nature it has always been to tempt man and draw him into evil;
as shall be proved by reason elsewhere) was overswayed to try evil; one act of
which, had not God through his grace prevented it, might have been valid enough
to corrupt his nature in such a manner, that he would have been rendered
incapable of ever recovering his former state, or of acting a good act; By
reason that the commission of one evil act must needs have effected a privation
of that habit, which he once had of working good: for they being acts
proceeding from two contrary habits, the latter must have expelled the former,
which would have remained unrecoverable; because a privatione ad habitum non
datur regressus. After a privation a habit cannot return: Put out your sight
once, and you will never recover it. Wherefore it must have followed, that man
being arrived to this depraved state of nature must have become a mere alien
from God, in whose former resemblance his happiness did consist. Furthermore,
the immortal spirit, expiring out of the body in that condition, abides
eternally in absence and dissemblance from God, which two cases makes its state
most woeful and dismal. Thus you may remark, that it is possible to a natural
man by way of a Sorites to collect his first beatitude, deficience, guilt, and
punishment.

II. Is it not then a man's greatest concernment to bestir himself in this need
and defect for a means of restoration? Here may be demanded, How can a man hope
for restoration, if the habit of acting good is quite extirpated, and that from
a privation to a habit, there is no returning? 2. Why may not a man have the
same hopes of restoration here in this world, as well as out of it, as the
Papists hold?

To the first I answer, That extirpation may be understood in a twofold
representation. 1. As it represents a total extinction and annihilation, Nihil
remanente sui. 2. As it does represent not a total, yet almost a total
annihilation, there still remaining some part of the thing: thus a man says
his eye is out, when he can see but a little. It is possible for a man to be in
either of these conditions: if he is in the first, questionless he is in a
lost condition, and is incapable of recovery, for the objected reason. The
continual acting of evil produces a total habit of evil; wherein if a man be
habituated, that small portion of the remaining good is totally extirpated: As
in an Atheist, who is one, wherein the habit of Good is totally extinct, which
makes him affectately and perversely ignorant of God, and in whom the habit of
evil is radicated, whereby he becomes a blasphemer against God in denying his
being.

III. An Atheist has not so much virtue or power in him, as thereby to do one
good action. A good action is, which does resemble its pattern (Bona censetur
actio, quae suae ideae fuerit conformis) and therefore must, 1. Proceed from a
good principle. 2. Be employed about a good object. 3. Be intended to a good
end. A good action here taken in a moral, not physical signification, whose
principle and object is right Reason and moral good: Its end is to be agreeing
with a good will. So that an Atheist cannot work a good work; his principle of
Good (to wit right Reason) being totally depraved and corrupted; for he in
denying God denies his right Reason, when, as I have proved in the Doctrine of
Souls, right Reason cannot, but must necessarily retain an impression of God's
existence, goodness and omnipotence, from whom she received her production: or
he in denying God denies his own being, his being consisting in a resemblance
to the Image of God, the perfect pattern of his once perfect essence; which
does argue, that his right Reason is totally extinct, and that there remains
a plenar possession of corruption and depravation in his understanding and
will, through which he judges of all things, otherwise than they are. And this
is farther evident; because our understanding judges of all things in
ordination to action, all our actions are performed in ordination to our last
end, which being positively denied by him, proves the truth of the fore-stated
Conclusion.

The second Qualification of a good action is, That its object must be good. A
man's will is carried forth to a triple object, whereof two have respect to the
body, the other to the soul. Of the two respecting the body, one is desired for
the conservation of the body; the other for conservation of the species or
kind. These as being Physical objects are Physically good to all natural
Bodies; for Ens and bonum convertuntur, a Being and Good are convertible.
Wherefore this maxim, Omnia appetunt Bonum. All Beings covet good, and cannot
covet evil, is only to be understood of Physical good objects.

The third Object relating to the soul is moral good, whose objectivenesse is
only proper to rational essences.

The last condition required in a good action is its direction to a good end;
which is, to God's glory and praise, to the admiration of his Wisdom,
Omnipotence and all others of his Attributes. If we compare the actions of an
Atheist with these three qualifications, we shall find them infinitely
different, and deffective from them, they proceeding from the worst of
principles, and being employed about improportionate and brutish objects, and
directed to a wicked, malicious, and hellish end, namely to Gods greatest
dishonor.

IV. Summarily to give you a Character of an Atheist An Atheist is a most
horrid monster; once a man, now worse than a Brute; a Devil in the shape of a
man; ungrateful beyond the expression of a tongue; rigidly injurious to God
and man; a sinner beyond the worst of sinners; a fit object for God's
vengeance, and the greatest torment, that the depth of Hell and envy of Devils
are able to spue out.

Is there a sin, which God, although he is infinitely merciful, has
resolved not to pardon, it is confirmed Atheism; this is the only treason,
which man can commit against God. The injury which he does unto God, is in
Blaspheming his sacred Name; robbing him of his Honor, and of all his
Attributes; and that, which does infinitely augment his sin, is his
persistence in it after such an unexpressible indulgence.

It is impossible, that all vices should lodge and center in one man: for I
could never hear that any natural man was so vicious, but he had some good (I
mean good, as the vulgar calls it) quality in him. Many have accused such a
one for being a Drunkard, another for a Robber, or a Cheat; yet some there will
be still, who you may hear say, although such a one is a Drunkard, yet he is
honest, or kind, or civil, etc. or of another, although he is a Robber, yet he
is no Murderer; although a Cheat, yet he is no Drunkard: so that I say, there
is no natural man so vicious, but there is something in him, which people will
say is good: But an Atheist has a nest of all vice in him; there is not a vice
so detestable or deformed, although it be against nature, but he dares make
trial of it; because he dreads neither God, or his Law. An Atheist will wrong,
cheat, revile his own parents; he will murder his own relations, friends, or
others, if it be for his interest, or pleasure; he will Rob, steal, defame,
blaspheme, and what not? it is true he does not always do these acts, because
he fears the Law of man, nevertheless his will is not backward, but prone to
all manner of wickedness, what should hinder him? his conscience will not,
because that is deaded: but it quickneth again a little before his death, and
then begins his rage and torment, then the Devils come about him, each
busied in increasing his woe and misery, then Hell and Eternity is at hand.

There are many, who seeming to judge charitably of all men, cannot be
persuaded there are Atheists. In these I shall soon correct their tenderness.
There was never a subversion of a legal government, but there appeared
hundreds of Atheists; They at such times are called subtle Politicians, who
finding such success by making Scripture and Religion, or rather hypocrisy, a
cloak for to cover all their wicked designs, imagine thence, that Religion and
Scripture were invented for that same purpose, because it has so well served
their turns. Pray what is this but absolute atheism? yea more than this, if
they see it is for their interest, to murder an innocent person or persons, yea
were it a whole Nation; they will not stick to do it out of hand: if they stand
in want of treasures, they will steal and rob it from the people, and tell
them, it is for the good of the Commonwealth in general, although their intent
is to make it good to themselves alone in particular. What crime is so great,
but is committed at such times. There is no History that treats of Rebellion,
but may be a president of Atheism.

Here may be questioned, Since that an Atheist has utterly lost his right
reason, whether God cannot be moved through his goodness or mercy, to create a
new understanding or reason in him? The Solution of this question take out of
these two subsequent conclusions.

1. There is nothing imaginable to be created, which exceed; Gods absolute
omnipotence. God as he is infinite in power, his acts are also infinite: as he
is omnipotent, he is all-creating. Has he not created Angels, men, the world,
and all things therein contained? I conclude then, that the restitution of an
Atheist, is possible through God's absolute omnipotence.

2. God is infinitely perfect whose perfection is revealed to us through his
most perfect attributes, which are, his omnipotence, justice, mercy, goodness,
etc. it is certain these are all perfections in the highest degree. The
concordance or agreeing of these attributes one with the other is no less a
perfection: for should they disagree, it would be an imperfection not to be
conceived in the most perfect being. This premised, I infer, That God is
omnipotent according to the concordance of his attributes; what is there but
God can effect it if agreeing with his attributes? Possibly you may object, God
cannot recall a thing, which is past; as that a man, who is now, should not
have been; or that a man, who died this day, should not have died; or that he
can not make a Devil an Angle etc. I answer, That the effecting of these acts
is disagreeing with Gods attributes Take Attributes here in a large sense
namely with his unchangeable or ordained will. His ordained will is, that man
should die at a certain minute, that the Devils should remain damned to all
eternity, that a thing should pass without being recalled; for should God
recall his will, he would cantradict himself, and therefore such is not to be
supposed. God, no question, can do greater things, and therefore his power is
not to be doubted in lesser. I conclude hence, that it is disagreeing with Gods
ordained will and justice to restore an Atheist, Gods professed and greatest
enemy, who therefore deserves the rigor of Gods justice; and although God's
mercy is infinite, yet it must agree with his justice. Can God's mercy extend
to an Atheist, or can he have compassion with that, which is altogether evil
and contrary to his nature? No certainly, for the object of God's mercy must be
good, be it never so little. An Atheist only is a sinner against the holy
Ghost, he is such whom to sanctify is disagreeing with the nature of the holy
Ghost. What shall or can the holy Ghost cast its beams upon that, which is
altogether evil? Here may be demanded, How does the holy Spirit then manifest
it self to any, since all men are sinners, and all sinners are evil?

I answer, That all men, except Atheists, have some spark of good lodging in
them, upon which the holy Spirit does work, and which it does increase and
cherish, whereby at last a man weakneth the habit of sinning.

Object* An Atheist may save a man from drowning, but in so doing he does a
good act. Ergo, An Atheist has still some spark of good resting in him.

I answer, That it is in no wise a good act, neither does it proceed from a
good principle, or is it directed to a good end. The ground upon which he does
it, is upon consideration, that were he in the same case, or the like, he would
be glad another should do the same to him; so that it is for his own ends; for
otherwise did he imagine, that a man's drowning might conduce to his benefit,
doubtless he would never prevent it.

The second Representation of the extirpation of a habit is, when there yet
remains some spark of good; which is inherent in all natural men, though in
an unequal proportion, according to the prevalence of the evil habit. What soul
is there so rooted in iniquity, which does not sometimes a good act (per se)
through it self; and this is a sign, that there is a good disposition latent in
all men. A murderer, soon after he has committed that heinous crime, is
immediately checked through the sting and light of his conscience, reasoning
that God is just, and thence dreads his wrath. Now to dread God is a good
action proceeding from the instinct and remaining light of the soul, which is
also a good principle, and consequently is a mark, that he is not totally evil.
You may reply against the consequence, and argue, That the Devils dread and
fear God; but the Devils are unable of effecting a good act; and therefore fear
in a murderer is not a good action. I answer, That the fear of God naked, and
not clothed with a repentance, and effluence from a good principle, does not
imply a good act, and therefore the naked fear in Devils a bateth nothing from
their evil: but as to a murderer in fearing God's justice, wishes he had not
committed the fact. Fear brings with it a great unquietness of mind, but a man
naturally wishes the removal of any unquietness of spirit, and therefore a
murderer wishes his crime undone, with a resolution, questionless never to
attempt the like again, which is a kind of repentance. But here you seem to
charge me with a second objection, That many murderers after so villainous an
enterprise are not possessed with any fear of God's justice, unquietness of
mind, or any other kind of repentance, but persisting in their pravity and
wickedness, and affirming until the last, that were it to do again, they
should not omit the doing of it. I answer, That these wretches are in no tittle
differing from Atheists, since they wilfully blot the remembrance of God and
his Laws out of their consciences; for otherwise ^^ were impossible, but they
must be surprised with fear.

CHAP. XV. Of the Means and Manner of Man's escape and Restoration.
1. What is requisite for a man to consider in order to his escape and
restitution. 2. How a man may naturally find out a means tending to his
restitution. 3. The description of God's mercy. 4. The explanation of the
precedent description. 5. The act, through which God's mercy does succor a
natural soul in her contention.


I. IT is not enough for man to be sensible of the danger, wherein he is, but
it behooves him further to lay out for a means of escape and recovery;
wherefore it will be requisite to explain, 1. That there is a means for man's
recovery. 2. How those means are to be procured. 3. The disposition of will
whereby a man is to procure that means.

II. Man, being awaked through the resentment of his perilous condition, makes
a search (omnibus naturaliter sui salutem molientibus. All beings naturally
endeavoring their preservation,) through a spark of that dusky light still
glowing in him into all probable means, and infers from that ordinary maxim,
(Simile simili conservatur. All beings are preserved by their like) that the
soul being a Spirit, she must also expect her preservation from a spirit; hence
concludes, that the same spirit, to whom he acknowledges his Creation and
existence, must be the only means of his preservation and restitution. The
soul having now discovered a means, she directs her next aim to a further
search. How and whereby to procure the said means, she argues with her self;
God through his goodness has given me a being (Summum Bonum est sui maxim
diffusivum) And the same attribute, which moved him to confer an essence upon
me, will certainly move him to preserve it from perishing, and restore it to
its primitive state. This produces a hope in the soul, which is a middle
passion between a certain knowledge, and an utter despair, partaking somewhat
of an assurance, and as much of a Despair. During this anguish, the soul
further disputes with her self, God is good, and therefore will save her; on
the other side her conscience accuses her, in that she has put her happiness
at a stake by offending against the goodness of God, and deflecting from her
primitive perfection, which (no doubt) but God's justice will be satisfied for.
God's justice is an attribute, whereby he separateth all those from his
presence, that are unlike to him. The soul now in a tempest surrounded with
innumerable waves of doubts and commotions of spirit, labors with all her
strength to come to an anchor, or to make for a harbor; here she beats against
the rock of God's justice ready to founder, then beats off again to Gods
goodness, and saves her self from danger of the first stroke; yet the same
peril being imminent upon her, she agrees with her self to steer another
course, whereby to consult her safety, at last lights upon an infallible
Pilot God's mercy, which brings her clear off to a harbor of assurance and
quietness, which is a natural faith.

III. God's mercy is an attribute, through which he is moved to succor a
perishing soul laboring for its own recovery. This attribute ((...)) according
to the capacity of humane reason, is called compassion and pity. Compassion in
us is an endeavoring to help a man grappling with his misery. The same
compassion has a resemblance to that, which is in God, although infinitely
inferior to it: for we spying the misery wherein a man is involved bearing
down and overcoming his happiness, do endeavor from a principle of love
(through which we incline to what ever is like to us, and reject what ever is
unlike) to support and aid him by adjoining a force of the same nature to that,
which is suppressed. But when a man is rendered altogether miserable and
unsupportable, then we reject him, and our compassion toward him cease,
because his misery has overcome his happiness, or his evil has totally
expelled his good; and so he remains in a desperate state: for instance, A man
who is a going to be hanged for sacrilege, and he persisting in his crime
until the last, is desperate and quite lost, as having no good in him: now our
compassion cannot be moved toward such an one, because he is totally evil,
whom to pity proves in vain.

IV. But to return to the exposition of the definition of mercy: First, I say
it is an Attribute. God's Attributes are principles and perfections, whereby we
conceive him ((...)) to effect acts really distinct one from the other. They
are called Attributes, because we attribute them to him, thereby to make a
distinction in our understandings of the several acts, proceeding as it were
from distinct powers, which really do not: for in God there is no distinction
to be imagined, that supposing a composition, and a composition an
imperfection: so that what ever we attribute to any of God's Attributes, is to
attribute it to God himself. Nihil est in Deo quin sit ipse Deus. There is
nothing in God, but what is God himself.

V. The Act, which flows from God's mercy, does succor and strengthen the
soul in this contention, by expelling the cloudinesse, which the material
species and depravate appetite of the body have cast about it, whereby they
draw the soul from God, and inchant her to sottish pleasures.

God's mercy is distinguished from his goodness, because through his goodness
he acts that, which is good (tota sua Natura) in it self, or acts upon good
having no part of evil opposing it, as to create man or the world, or to
preserve man in his innocence. His mercy has a respect to good, as it is
opposed by evil; as to redeem man is an act of God's mercy.

CHAP. XVI. Of the Light and Darkness of Man's practick understanding.
1. That Light and Darkness are analogal to principles of good and evil. 2.
Queries concerning Light and Darkness. 3. The two kinds of Light. What the
first Light is, and how it produces the second Light. 4. What the Habit of
Light is: That the first man acted without habits. How a habit is acquired. 5.
That the first man acted through a natural disposition, and not through any
habits.


I. WE have sometimes made mention of Good and Evil, Light and Darkness, which
being in this Treadse stated the two principles of man's actions, whether good
or evil, it will not be impertinent to unfold the nature of each. By the way
you are to take notice, that Light is analogal to the principle of good, and
darkness to the principle of evil, which analogy Col. 1. 12, 13.
containing a clear and express emblem of good and evil, we shall therefore
the rather retain its Analogata for to explain.

II. Concerning Light and Darkness may be inquired, 1. What Light is, or what
the habit of Light is. 2. What Darkness is, and how it is to be taken in this
place. 4. How it is otherwise called. 5. How it got its first footing in man.
6. What proportion there is between the remaining Light, and this habit of
Darkness. 7. How two contrary habits can both inhere in the same subject at
the same time. 8. Whether the habit of Light is a habitus per se, and the habit
of Darkness a habitus per accidens. 9 How one contrary habit does act against
the other. 10. How the one at last happens to extirpate the other.

III. Light, as you may know further in the second Book, part 2. is either
primitive or derivative: The first is called Lux, and through its emanative
power is by some said to cause the second, otherwise named Lumen: or in English
the former may be rendered a Light, the latter an Enlightening. The soul her self
is the primitive Light, which irradiates or enlighteneth the whole body. This
illumination is more splendid and of greater luster in the brain and animal
spirits, than in any other part, because the Lumen is reflexed through a
repercussion against the arterial and membranous parts of the brain.

IV. The habit of Light is nothing else, but the facility or easiness of the
first Light in actuating the second, which happens through a less opposition
of the organ, and of the contrary habit of darkness. But I shall explain my
meaning more amply. The first man in the state of his integrity had no habit in
him, whence his acts proceeded, but were effected through a natural disposition
and principle of good, which God through his bounty had conferred upon him.
This natural disposition produced its first acts as perfect, or with the same
facility, as it did the following acts; for otherwise man could not be supposed
to have been created perfect.

V. Hence it appears, that man at his first creation had no habit; for a habit
according to Philosophers, is (Habitus est qualitas adventitia ad operandum cum
facilitate) an acquired quality, through which a substance is inclined to act
with ease. Observe then, 1. It is an acquired quality, that is, not natural. 2.
That through a habit we do operate with ease, which supposes there was a
difficulty of working before we had acquired this habit. But wherein lay the
difficulty? either in the power of acting, or in the instrument, or in the
object upon which it acted. There could be no difficulty in the power, for that
inhering in the substantial form is unalterable. Ergo in the instrument and
object. Now then the difficulty in the instrument and object is removed by
often fitting the organ to the object, and the object to the organ, and so you
see a habit is acquired through many repeated acts. Wherefore the first man in
his entire state needed no habit, he acting all things naturally, and with
ease: His organs were all perfect, and had no resistance in them against the
power, or no unfitness to the object; so likewise the objects were all fitted
to their several organs.

CHAP. XVII. Containing rational discoveries of Man's primitive, and second
estate.
1. That Man was created most perfect. A proof from reason, inferring God to be
a most rational spirit. 2. That Man by means of his first and second light,
understood all beings perfectly in their proper natures, as they were. 3. That
the first man did not sleep during his incorrupt estate. 4. That the first man
did eat and drink. 5. That the first man would have generated in the same
manner, and through the same parts, as he did afterward, but without that
shame and sinful lust. That there were no co-Adamites. The absurdity of that
blasphemous opinion touching prae-Adamites. 6. That the first man was beyond
danger of erring in any action proceeding from his soul. 7. A rational inquiry
into the first sin, and knowledge of the first Commandment. 8. The manner of
man's fall proved by reason. His punishment for the breach of the first
Commandment. 9. A further collection of man's punishment for his first sin.
That a present unavoidable temporal death was part of man's punishment, and not
a present unavoidable eternal death. 10. That man after his fall was not become
utterly evil. 11. An enumeration of the relicts of Good in man.


TO tell you how darkness first ceased on man, it will be necessary to examine
and dive into his first creation, the state and manner of it, and hence, by way
of consequence, to deduct the casualties and accidents, to which he was
exposed. First, Beyond all arguments

Man was created most perfect in his essence and operations, because whatever
is immediately created by God must be perfect; the reason is, in that God is a
most perfect cause, and therefore his immediate effects and acts cannot but be
most perfect; and man above all, he being created according to God's own image.
You may demand how I come to know that? I answer, that man may easily
apprehend, that God is a spirit, because his substance is immediately
imperceptible through any of the external senses: were he material, his body
would be perceptible through its trinal dimension of parts, nevertheless his
acts upon material objects are but mediately, every minute perceived by us
through the said intermediate actions upon material objects. Secondly, We know
that he is most rational and understanding, because Right Reason cannot but
judge all his acts to be most Rational: on the other part, the soul knows her
self to be a spirit, because her essence is also immediately imperceptible by
any of the external senses. That she is rational needs no proof. Wherefore
hence it is apparent enough, that man was created after God's image.

II. The first light then, being most perfect, produced also its second light
in no less perfection; particularly that, which is isntrumental to its
Reasoning, which made man capable of understanding all things in the world in
their own nature: Besides there was no resistance or obscurity in any of the
objects; because they, being all created for the service of man, had their
natures (as it were) writ upon their breast, so that herein they were at the
command of the understanding: not only so, but his will exercised a free and
despotick command over all God's creatures, whether inanimated or animated,
which latter, and particularly beasts, were all of a meek and obedient nature,
otherwise they could not have fitted man's occasions.

III. Whether man in this state naturally slept or not, is dubious: yet it is
more probable, that he did not; because sleep arises from an imperfection of
the Body, and weariness of the animal spirits, which is not to be supposed in
so perfect a creature. Besides sleep would have detracted part of his
happiness, because an intermission from joy is a kind of misery; and a total
abolishment of joy is a total misery.

IV. Man did eat and drink; for otherwise many parts of his body, as his
stomach, gutts, liver, spleen, kidneys, bladder, etc. would have been formed in
vain.

V. Man, had he continued in his primitive state, would have generated, and in
the same manner through the same parts, as he did since, although without that
sinful lust and shame: The reason is, Because the sparmatick parts, or
genitals would else be supposed to be superadded for no end.

It is probable that Adam did not generate in his incorrupt state; for if he
had, he would have begot children (since that through his entire perfection, he
could miss of no end in any of his actions) who not participating of original
sin would in like manner have continued their race to this day, and have
remained in Paradise; but finding, that no such Paradise can at present be
discovered upon earth, and that all the best parts of the earth are known; we
may justly infer the probability of the fore-stated conclusion. Possibly you
may object, That Paradise is in another material world, as supposing every Star
to be a world. I answer, That your objection is absurd, and has no apparent
foundation, as I have proved in my Physics. The same reasons do also show the
absurdity of that blasphemous opinion touching Pra-Adamites and co-Adamites.

VI. There was no action or pleasure, if immediately proceeding from the soul,
wherein man could err: because the soul, having a resemblance to the Divine
Nature, had in it self no contrariety or principle of error. Neither could he
sin in the pleasures of his mind, they deriving from the contemplation of his
Creator.

VII. It is also certain, that God, as he is Creator and King of, and over all
his creatures, did require obedience from them, whereby they should express
their subjection, humility, and love to him: Wherefore (no doubt) he imposed
some one commandment upon them, which would be sufficient to testify their
obedience and subjection. This command did not reach to the immediate or pure
object of the soul, but necessarily to the object of the Body. The command upon
the object of the body must have been aninterdiction of some one of its
pleasures, to which it was inclined: otherwise had there been but little
difficulty in it, it would have expressed but an indifferent observance, or
love. The pleasures of the body consists mainly im^ating; so that it is
probable some edible thing was interdicted, from which man was to abstain. And
although this command did immediately extend to the body, yet there being that
sympathy between the soul and it, the one could easily move the other, whereby
it did also mediately reach the soul also.

The breach of this commandment must have threatened some punishment for to
imprint a fear upon man.

VIII. This punishment was imposed upon that, which should be the first
inticer, which necessarily was the body through its appetitive faculty. No
question but man sustained also the force of the Devil (because we are yet
minutely attached by him) who wrought upon him in a disguise (for had he
appeared to man in his own shape, man would have shunned him) more by cunning
and stratagems, than as an open enemy; By diverting him from thinking upon God,
in drawing his understanding to a sensual object, so that he wrought first upon
man's body, in proposing some pleasant object to its appetite, which did soon
entice the soul's will.

Wherefore Man could not have deflected from God without yielding to this
attraction of the Devil, and ceasing for a while from contemplating God, to
whom had he but returned in time, it would soon have recalled him from all the
allurements of the evil spirit. However man went on in harkening to the evil
spirit; And so much the more, because it is probable, the Devil appeared to
him, professing an entire friendship in proposing somewhat, which might conduce
to the amendment of his condition, and pleasure of his Body. This done, the
Devils work was the better half finished. Hereupon man yielding to the Devils
persuasion, and to please his lust, soon after forfeited his happiness: His
distinct knowledge of things failed him; his fruition of God was lost; his
bodily appetite was now more increased than ever, and thence committed the same
sin a thousand times over. All God's creatures disobeyed him; beasts grew
fierce, herbs poisonous. The Elements lost their purity, the Sun yielded of his
light and brightness, the stars of their virtues and influences. This great
alteration immediately hereupon succeeding, he soon perceived that he had
sinned, and at the same instant felt the punishment for sin: he needed no
trial, for his conscience yielded.

Now let us collect what man's punishment was for this alone first sin.

IX. It was not a present, unavoidable, eternal separation from God; for then
God would have cast him into hell immediately, like he did the Devil, whose
crime was unpardonable, since he aspired to have been God himself, and in whom
there remained not the least spark of good, but being rendered altogether evil,
there remained nothing in him worth saving. Hence by the way I confirm my
former proposition, that man had a principle of good remaining in him after his
fall: for otherwise God should have cast him into hell immediately.

2. It was a present, temporal, unavoidable death, namely a separation of the
soul from the body; which he soon concluded from the alteration of his body and
disposition to sickness, through which his body at last must necessarily be
brought to a temporal death: yet this temporal death did not exclude an eternal
one, in case he neglected the most gracious means destained for his restitution.

3. It consisted in a partial unlikenesse to God: for before he knew all things
distinctly by one operation of mind, now by many, then without error, now
subject to mistakes and errors.

4. The loss of Paradise. The seat, wherein he was first constituted, was
before full of all perfections, abounding of all things for the good of man:
all herbs were nourishing; flowers fragrant; beasts of a soft, pleasant, and
delightful nature; the Elements in their splendor; the Earth fruitful; the
waters sweet; the air clear and wholesome; the fire pure. Soon after all was
changed; some herbs became venomous, others still reserving some goodness in
them; some flowers changed into a stink, others retained yet some sweet odor;
so some Beasts became wild, others remaining tame; a part of the earth remained
barren, and a part fruitful, etc.

X. Had man then become quite evil through this one act, all that, which had
been subservient to him before, would now have become noxious and destructive
to him. His knowledge of God was not totally blotted out, his knowledge of all
other things was not quite abolisht: for he knew them still, although not with
the same distinction and evidence. Since then it was so, that part of man's
enjoyments were yet remaining, and that part changed into crosses, it is
probable, that a part of the good in man remained, and a great part of evil
entered; for had man not retained some good in him, God would have taken all
good away from him.

Now after the shipwreck of man's happiness and admission of evil, let us also
examine what remained in him, that might still be termed good.

1. There remained in man after his fall a knowledge of his Creator. 2. A
Reasoning faculty. 3. His body as yet in health, but disposed to sickness and
death. 4. A place wherein to live*
All these Relicts were much impaired to what they were; nevertheless God left
them for some end: namely, that they might serve man as a means for his
restitution.

I had almost forgot to insert among man's remains his free will: for no
question the first man had a free will to good and evil, which it is probable
remained also partially in him after his fall.

CHAP. XVIII. Of the manner of the Suppression, Extinction, Predominance and
Triumph of the Habit of Good.
1. The repetition of some of the principal principles of this Treatise. 2.
What it is that hinders the Habit of Good. 3. How the good Habit happens to be
deaded, and overcome by the evil habit. How the good Habit happens to suppress
and vanquish the evil habit. 4. That we are apt to incline most to those things
that are forbidden. 5. A proof inferring darkness to proceed from the
prevalence of the corporeal appetite. 6. Why it is, that a man must necessarily
die. The ground detected upon which the Papists were induced to state a
Purgatory. Their error rejected. 7. That the proportion of these two Habits is
various in every individual subject.


I. BY what has been proposed in the foregoing Chapter you may now fully
comprehend the nature of Darkness or habit of evil, and how man fell into it.
You may further remember, that man had no habit of Good, because nothing
resisted his natural powers: wherefore it is no absurdity to assert, That man
acts now good and evil through acquired or infused habits. Moreover let me
desire you to take notice, how man fell into sin: viz. That it was through
the inclination and enticement of his corporeal or sensual appetite, and that
thereby his reason was not drawn aside violente or coactive, but inclinative
and dispositive: that through this the body, as it were, got the upperhand of
the soul, insomuch that after the soul had submitted her self once to the
command of the body, she thereby forfeited her superiority: that the body after
the fall being corrupted and grown less serviceable to the soul, it had
stronger influence upon the soul than ever: That the habit of the soul is
nothing else, but an easiness of working its acts, whether good or evil; which
is attained through frequent repetitions of the same acts, and through it at
last makes the organs easy, and the objects fitted.

II. Where as all habits presuppose a difficulty, through which the former acts
have been hindered, that, which hinders the good habit, is the forcible drawing
and prevalence of the sensual appetite, whereby it is set on and inclined to
sensual acts, which for the most part prove to be evil.

III. Wherefore this good habit is nothing else, but the same principle of good
somewhat deaded and diverted by the sensual inclinations of the body; for as a
flaming fire may be deaded and choakt through black smokes, whereby it is
hindered from flaming, and yet continue a fire, and may blaze again, were the
smokes but discussed; in fire we see, when it begins to blaze a little, by
degrees it blazes more and more, until at last it gets to a flame, which keeps
its life the better, and expels the smoke more vigorously; but if it begins
to leave flaming, and come to blazing, and from blazing return to a deadish
light, then the smoke overcomes it, and deads it again: Even so it is with the
habits of the soul; man's light keeps blazing, until it is deaded and choakt
through the dark smokes of his inordinate sensual appetite; but if it be
ventilated, and stirred up by frequent repetitions of good acts, it is
vivified, and lasts. This light, if it is once come to an intyre flame, it
can never be totally darkened: possibly it may now and then remit somewhat of
its luster; but in case this light does only blaze a little now and then, or it
may be flame a while, yet if it rise not to burn clear quite through,
nevertheless it will perish, and is to be counted for a flash.

IV. It is then the inordinate appetite of the body, which smothereth up the
light of the soul, because through it she is led aside by harkning altogether
to its motion, and suffering the understanding and will to bend to its
pleasures, and especially to such which are forbden.

Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata.
That, which the Law does most from us require,
Is most gainsaid by our perverse desire.
Herein is the habit of the soul deaded and overcome by the evil habit of the
body.

The soul may produce good acts although with difficulty, because she is
opposed by the evil habit of the body: But the oftener those acts are repeated,
the more the soul does triumph over the body, and subdueth it under her
command, yet not so as to tie up its whole force; because the body being once
corrupted cannot be redintegrated in this world, there remaining a debt to be
paid; to wit, death, which was contracted, as has been showed, through guilt
of the first transgression. You may here enquire, Why God through his infinite
mercy does not forgive man this debt of death?

I answer, That God through his justice cannot, that requiring plenary
satisfaction, otherwise God's threatenings and ordinances might be supposed to
be in vain.

V. From all this it appears, that the darkness of the soul proceeds from
the predominance of the corporeal appetite misleading the soul, and
consequently that the good habit of man is per se, and the evil habit: per
accidens; for the same perfections, which the soul of the first man was endued
withal, are also conferred upon every individual soul, because each of these
does immediately emanate from God, and therefore is most perfect: Ergo, the
perfection or good of every soul is inherent in her per se, and the evil, which
does assault her is per accidens; for it is from the body. By the way let me
tell you in case you do maintain original sin, and assert it to be
propagated through infection, you must agree in this very tenent, viz. that it
is propagated through the infection of the body, which is per accidens to the
soul: for it cannot be propagated through the infection of the soul; for that
was created pure and perfect: or otherwise you must affirm, that the soul is ex
traduce, which is impious and atheistical.

VI. The body, since it is so corrupted, must be purified, which cannot be,
unless the soul leaves it for a while: but as for the soul, if it deserteth
the body with an assurance of, and in God's mercy and goodness, it needs not
to die, because it was not essentially corrupted, but accidentally; and
expiring out of the body arrives to God's presence in the same purity, and
perfection, as it was endued with at her first infusion. Wherefore the Papists
do most heretically mistake in arguing, that the soul for to be purified must
abide a while in Purgatory. Here may be objected, If the soul remains good
per se, and the evil be per accidens, then the soul of every wretch being
dissolved from the body is entirely pure and holy? I deny the consequence; for
as long as God's justice is not satisfied for their sin committed in the flesh,
both their body and soul must necessarily be damned: but as for the soul of a
regenerated man, the guilt of his sins being taken away, and God's justice
satisfied in this world, the soul when dissolved from the body remains
essentially and naturally good without any further purification.

VII. The proportion, which there is between these two habits, is very various
and different in most persons: for we see, that some persons their bodies and
appetites are more depraved than others, and consequently their good habits
more deaded, and that some have much more ado to rebuke their sensual
inclinations than others.

CHAP. XIX. Of Original Sin.
1. How it is possible for two contrary Habits to inhere in one subject. 2. The
absurdities, that follow this Assertion, viz. That the evil habit inheres in
the soul per se. 3. In what manner the Habit of good is taken to inhere per se
in the soul. 4. That God created every man theologically good. Several
Objections, relating to the same assertion, answered. 5. How the soul partaketh
of the guilt of Original Sin. The opinion of the Synod of Rochel upon this
matter.


I. NOw we may easily explain how two contrary habits can inhere in one and the
same subject. No question it is impossible two contraries should inhere both
per se in one subject; for the nature of contraries is to expel one another
out of the same subject: Yet it is not repugnant but that two contrary habits
may inhere both in one subject, provided the one exist in it per se, and the
other per accidens, or that they be not inherent in one partial subject,
although they may in the total: for it is possible for a man to be afflicted
with two contrary diseases in two parts of his body, yet both are sustained by
one total subject. In like manner may the evil habit be principally and
originally inherent in the body, and the good habit in the soul, yet both these
are contained in one man.

II. Notwithstanding all this, there are some, who obstinately do affirm, that
the evil habit inheres in the soul per se, but how do they prove it? Certainly
upon these suppositions.

1. That the habits may be altered, and the substance remain the same.

2. That the first man acted through habits.

3. That the good habit being removed the evil habit succeeded in its steed,
and consequently that an Accident does migrate e subjecto in subjectum. which
is against their own maxims.

These suppositions being all false, as has been proved at large, cannot be a
firm foundation for any conclusion whatever they have built upon them. And
therefore I conclude again,

1. That in the first man there was a natural disposition of acting good, but
no habit.

2. That there became two habits in man after his fall, the one of good, and
the other of evil.

III. That the habit of good inheres in man per se (Quatenus actionis
principium dicatur anima, inest ei habitus bonus per se, aut prout habitus sit
accidens, secundum istud potest animae attributi inesse per accidens, quia ipse
habitus est accidens; quae tamen mihi est in usitata locutio.) And the habit of
evil per accidens (Non quatenus proficiscatur ab anima tanquam a mali
principio, sed duntaxat quatenus sit animae instrumentum.) Here one may object,
If an evil act proceed per se from the soul, than the evil habit is also
inherent in her per se. As to this, the same I may argue from a good act, and
thence infer the inherence of the good habit per se. But it is certain, that
two contrary opposites (secundum idem ad idem) cannot exist together at the
same instant in the same subject; so that the one habit must necessarily inesse
per se, and the other per accidens. Before I go farther, let me tell you once
for all, when I say that the good habit is per se in man, I do not imply, that
it is ex se, but e Dei gratia, e voluntate and potentia divina ordinata; to
deny this is to rob God of his honor, and is no less than a blasphemy:
wherefore it ought to be a great caution to all men, how they assert good
habits per se, or good works per se, lest they offend.

IV. God creates every man theologically good, that is, God infuseth the soul
theologically good into the body being good also: for otherwise God would be
supposed to join good to evil. How could the body be evil before the advent of
the soul? If it were evil, it must be morally evil (for there is no doubt but
it was and remains physically good) but that cannot be admitted, because
there is no moral evil without a rational will. Good and evil is taken in a
double sense:

1. Good or evil is that, which is agreeable or disagreeable with the Law of
God.

2. Good or evil is, which is convenient and suitable, or inconvenient and
unsuitable to a being.

According to the first acception, The soul is infused good into a good body,
because of the reason forementioned. But according to the last it is not.

Here may be demanded, Whether it agrees with God's goodness, to infuse a
good soul into an unsuitable body.

I answer, That it does not detract one title from God's goodness: for he has
ordained, that man should multiply and increase, and therefore has given man a
power of increasing and multiplying. The power, which man exercises to
multiply, is through propagation of his body only, and uniting the soul to it.
The body being then prepared for the souls reception, the soul at that instant
is raised out of the body (e potentia materiae receptiva) not out of it, as e
materiali principio eductivo, like unto material forms, but by the divine
power, which is ever present where God has ordained his benediction: so that
God does not withdraw his power of creating a soul, when ever a body is
prepared for it, although that body is generated by the worst of men, because
God has ordained it; for God does create a soul, not because a wicked man has
disposed a body for the reception of it, but because of his ordained blessing
to man's increase.

V. The soul being united to the body, immediately partaketh of the guilt of
original sin. What original sin is, me thinks, is not distinctly expounded
by our ordinary institutionists. They say, It is a natural disposition to evil,
naturally descending from Adam to all men; it is that, which is called, The
sin dwelling in man, The Law of our members, The old man, The flesh, The body
of sin, etc.

First, I demand, What sin is? I shall be answered, That it is a breach of
God's Law. Ergo, A sin is an act: for to break God's Law is to act against
God's Law. A disposition, say they, is, whereby an agent can act. Ergo, A
disposition to sin is no sin, because a disposition is no act, but whereby
we can, or do act. So that original sin is the first act of sin, which the
first man acted, who comprehending in him whole mankind, since all men were to
descend from him, the sin, which he acted, was also acted by whole mankind,
and consequently the guilt of that sin is imputed to every man. The habit of
sin being entered through one act, whereby we are rendered prone to evil, and
commit actual sin, or do act sin, the same habit and disposition has also
ceased on all mankind. So that original is rather the first actual sin, after
which followed the habit of sinning; and with the original or first sin of
man, the habit of sinning is withal communicated to man's posterity. This very
sense may be dtawn from their own words, although it was against their
intentions.

The Synod held at Rochel in the year 1607. in the month of March, renders
her self in these words, as further appears by their Confession. We believe,
that whole mankind, ever since Adam, is corrupted with such an infection, as
original sin is, to wit, an original defect. And in the 11th Artie We
believe, that this defect is a sin, and is sufficient to damn whole mankind
from the highest to the lowest, yea moreover the Infants in their Mothers womb.
What can any body apprehend by this original defect, but an actual sin, or how
could Infants be guilty of it?

CHAP. XX. Of the manner of Man's multiplication.
1. The state of the controversy. 2. That the Rational Soul is not generated,
or produced by generation. That there are three kinds of productions out of
nothing. 3. That the Soul is not propagated either from the Father or Mother.
4. That impious opinion concluding the Rational Soul to be generated tanquam ex
traduce, confuted. 5. An Objection against the Authors opinion answered. 6.
That the foetus before the advent of the Rational Soul is informated with a
form analogal to a sentient form. 7. That God is the remote cause of man's
generation. 8. That man does generate man naturally and per se. 9. The opinion
of Austin, Jerome, and others upon this matter.


1. I Had almost in the last Chapter fallen unawares into that intricate
Controversy about man's multiplication and increase, but fore seeing the
extent of it, I thought it fitter to retire my self to this Chapter, and treat
of it here singly.

Man consists of body and soul: as touching the body, there is no doubt made
of it, but that it is propagated tanquam ex traduce. All the stumbling is at
the rational soul, whether she be infused or propagated in like manner as the
body: or I may state the Question thus, Whether the soul of man is created or
produced by generation?

Conclus. The Rational Soul is not generated or produced through generation. I
prove it. That which is indivisible is produced in an indivisible part of time,
namely in an instant. But the Soul of man is indivisible, and therefore is
produced in an instant. Again, that, which is produced in an instant, is
created and not generated: Because generation does follow alteration, which is
by succession. Ergo, The Soul would not be constituted in an instant, but
successively, and consequently would be corporeal.

2. If the Soul had a power of generating a Soul, it had also a power of
destroying it by means contrary to those, whereby she had produced it.

3. Generatio unius est corruption alterius, and vice versa: Ergo, Quicquid est
generabile est corruptibile. The generation of one form or being is the
corruption of another; and the corruption of one is the generation of the
other: Ergo, What ever is generable is corruptible, and what ever is
corruptible is generable: So then when ever the soul is generated another soul
or form is corrupted; And when the soul is corrupted another form or soul is
generated, which may be, as the Indians hold, the soul of an horse, or of an
ass, etc. and so the soul is made material. To this possibly your answer will
be, That it is so in natural productions, but not in supernatural. I ask you
then, Why do you object this for an argument to prove the propagation of the
soul, viz. that man (Homo generat sibi similem) does generate his like,
otherwise he would be inferior to a beast. Ergo, You assert that man does
generate naturally like unto other creatures.

4. If otherwise to generate its like were a property belonging to supernatural
beings, then Angels would have a power of generating other Angels, which they
have not. Or if this power of generating were only superadded to one kind of
supernatural beings, namely to souls, then a soul would be more noble than an
Angel.

5. There are but two ways of producing a substance, to wit (e materia
praeexistente, vel e nihilo) out of a preexistent matter, or out of nothing.
What, is the soul produced out of a preexistent matter, as out of a potentia
eductiva? If you grant this, you expose your self to be suspected for a
Plinianist, and to assert the soul to be material. Ergo, It must be created out
of nothing. Now there are three kinds of productions out of nothing:

1. Enihilo termini ulterioris, sed aliquo materiae. 2. Enihilo materiae, sed
aliquo termini. 3. Enihilo materiae, and nihilo termini.
Here you must take terminus for forma: for what is it, that does terminate the
matter, but the form? and so the world was created ex aliquo materia, sed
nihilo termini: for it was created out of the Chaos, which was a rude matter
without an ulterior forma, or terminus. After the same manner was the body of
man created: for neither the Chaos, or dust, out of which man was created had
an ultimate form. Neither are you to imagine here, that generation, and this
kind of creation is one: for although in generation there is not that form
existent in the matter, which is intended in it, yet generation is ab aliquo
formae ultimae in eadem materia praeexistent is. The last kind of creation is
exemplified by the creation of the Chaos, of the dust, of Angels, and of Souls.
This manner of production is proper only to an infinite power: But you may
demand, Why cannot God invest the soul with this power? I answer, It is
impossible to God (Non simpliciter sed secundum quid) and to the nature of the
soul. As to God it is impossible; because should he confer his infinite power
upon man, he would make him equal to himself.

2. It is impossible to the nature of the soul; because she being limited,
cannot be unlimited or infinite at the same time. Omne quod est, idem quod est,
necesse est esse.

IV. Were the soul extraduce, then she would be propagated either from the
Father, or Mother, or from both. Not from the Father: for then the rational
soul would be inherent in the geniture at the same moment of conception, which
all grant is not: then from the Mother (as James Hostius his opinion was) which
is absurd; for all grant that the Mother is a passive, and the Father an active
principle; besides if so, men's souls would be extremely weak: not from both;
for then the soul would be of a mixed nature, which is no less absurd.

Give me leave here to examine Sealiger's notion, which Sennert, Kyper, and
others do assume to demonstrate the manner of the souls propagation.

Seal. Exerc. 6. D. 11. An anima catelli sit pars animae patris. Cur non?
dividitur ad materiae divisionem material is anima: totaque est in sui part,
quod in plant is manifestum est. Gignit autem animam anima sui promotione,
eadem sane ratione, quemadmodum a lampadis flamma flammam excipimus, illa
nihilominus integra remanente. He moves a Question, Whether the soul of a
whelp is a part of the soul of the dog that begot him: And why not? For a
material soul is divided according to the division of the matter, and she is
whole in its part; which is most evident in plants. Wherefore a soul begets
a soul by protruding her self, much after the same manner as we kindle a flame
with a flame of a lamp, the which nevertheless remains entire. Here Scaliger
explains the propagation of beasts and plants; and others do impiously apply
the same to the rational soul, and consequently make her material. But to the
point, the rational soul cannot protrude her self in this manner, because she
is indivisible: As for a flame, that protrudes its self; because it is
divisible, and communicates a part of its self to another combustible matter,
and so raises a flame; but this is not so in the soul.

V. After the confirmation of my opinion, it is requisite I should answer to
what may be objected against it. If the soul cannot generate a soul (may one
say) or cannot generate his like, then man is inferior to other living
creatures, which do generate their like.

I answer, That man does generate his like (for it is apparent, that the Son
i^ like the Father) and that in a nobler manner than animals or vegetables, who
do naturally generate their like as to matter and a corruptible form; but man
does generate the matter, and disposes it for the reception of an
incorruptible form: which done, the form is immediately united to it in
instanti, not from the soul singly and originally, but from the divine power,
which is always concomitant to God's benediction, by which he has through his
ordained will freely tied him. self. The divine power, being then always
present and concomitant to the generating soul, does, as it were, give a
rational soul to the plastic faculty of the genitures, when she is ready to
unite it to the body: where observe, that the generating soul is a subordinate
and mediate cause of the infusion of the other rational soul. The creating
power of God is the primar, principal, and immediate cause of man's rational
soul, and its production. It is the primar and immediate cause of the soul,
because it creates her: God of his goodness and blessing does give the soul
now at that instant created to the generating soul, as to a subordinate and
instrumental cause.

VI. By the generating soul I intend a material and divisible form, inherent in
the genitures mixed out of that, which is contributed from the Father, and that
other from the Mother. This form is analogal to a sensitive soul (but
notwithstanding must not be counted to be of the same species) and does
informate the body of the Infant, until the advent of the indivisible,
immaterial, immortal, and rational soul, and then it does acquit the name of a
form, and becomes a faculty, power, and instrument to the said rational soul.

VII. God is the remote cause of man's generation and production, because God
does notimmediately unite and insuse the soul into the body: for were God the
next cause of uniting the soul to the body, then true enough, man could not be
said to generate man; because the introduction or eduction of the form into, or
out of the mattor is the generation of the whole. Now then man is the
subordinate cause of the soul and its infusion, by reason his propagature
receives the soul, which is to be infused, from God, who is the primar and
original cause of it.

VIII. Conclus. 2. Man does generate man naturally and per se, although he does
not propagate the soul from himself. I prove it. He that uniteth the form to
the matter, as in this instance of uniting the soul to the body, does produce
the totum compositum, as, to generate or produce the whole man: But man uniteth
the soul to the body; therefore he generates or produces the whole man.

2. Man generateth man naturally and per se, because he has an absolute
(secundum quid) power of uniting the soul to the body: for otherwise he were
inferior to other creatures. This power is given him in these expressed words
of Scripture (saving my purpose) Let man multiply: How could man multiply had
he not this power? For did God infuse the soul immediately, as Divines
generally hold, man could not be said to multiply, but God.

The generating soul therefore is the Causa proxima of the infusion of the soul
into the body. Wherefore there are always souls ready (that are created at the
same moment, when needful) which are given to the generating soul: otherwise
were its uniting power in vain.

V. It is well expressed by Austin: If the soul be seminated with the flesh, it
shall also die with the flesh. And by Jerome: If the soul of man and of Beasts
be ex traduce, then consequently both must be corruptible. Plato in his Dialog.
Phaed. infers the soul's advent from without, as an Herculean argument to prove
her immortality. Coelius Rhodoginus lib. 6. Antiq. Lect. does wittily express
Aristotle's meaning of (...) and (...), the first whereof was asserted by him
to be mortal, the latter to be immortal: And if I mistake not, he seems to
affirm no less, Lib. 2. d. gener. cap. 3. viz. that (...) is inherent in the
sperm; but (...) of a divine rice, and immortal. Well may Tho. Aquinas
pronounce (...) upon all those, that should maintain the rational soul to be
extraduce, since most Heathen Philosophers did believe otherwise. What? because
those dull Lutherans had not the wit to know that original sin was propagated
through the body, therefore they must revive that Bombastin opinion, concluding
the soul to be propagated likewise, for to demonstrate her to participate of
the said sin. This we have showed with more probability already; and
therefore let us henceforth beware of so dangerous and atheistical an assertion.

I. ARt thou not stupefied, or have thou not lost thy reason through a
confirmed Atheism, then what has been hitherto delivered may take place in
thee, and gain, thee a full insight into thy past, present, and future state.
On the one hand, you know your misery and pravity by comparing the course of
your life with that rule, which is imprinted in your heart: On the other hand
you may fadom your own strength, and since that is decayed and weakened, you may
spy God ready to assist and succor you in this contention and strife against
your enemies, laboring all to pull him down. But how to procure God's aid and
succor, it is that, which I am about to advise you in. In the first place
consider whose enemy thou art, and ever have been, and what associates thou art
adjoined unto; under whose banner it is thou fightest; to what end, or what
victory it is you expect.

II. As to the first, thou art God's enemy, and have been so from the minute
thou wast conceived in. The associates among whose company and number thou have
ranged and listed thy self, are Infidels, Atheists, Wretches and Devils. The
Banner, under which thou marchest, and fightest, is Satan's, or the Prince of
Devils. The end and victory, which thou fightest for, (were it possible) is to
throw God out of his Throne: Now, bethink thy self; art thou not a fool, that
fightest against the mighty one, who is able to destroy thee in a moment? Art
thou not blinded to fight with such associates? Were that mote but removed out
of thy eye, thou would soon be astonished at their wickedness, and detest
their company. The Banner is as a vail cast before thy eyes to keep thee
ignorant of the Devils aim and craft, which tends to lead thee into utter
destruction. The Design, whereunto thou have subscribed, is the greatest piece
of rebellion and treachery. Now then, is it not time for thee to fly, and make
thy escape? Yet a moment and God sounds his alarm, and so ye are all laid in
the ground, and cast into an everlasting dungeon. But whither can thou fly,
but God will pursue thee? Thou can not cast thy self immediately upon God:
for his justice does judge thy crime high treason, and therefore unpardonable,
so that thou art condemned to execution. First, satisfy God's justice, and
then submit. But how may you enquire? Certainly, O man, if thou art to satisfy
God's justice and to appease his wrath, then thou art lost, and cast away for
ever, and yet since man has sinned, man must surely expect God's wrath. Now,
the means for thy escape is to cast thy self upon God's mercy, which is
infinite, and therefore of an equal weight to balance his justice: and believe
assuredly, that God's mercy will move his infinite-wisdome to find out some way
or other, whereby to satisfy his justice. It Is true, we have all sinned in one
man, to wit, the first man; but if God does send one righteous man into the
world, who through his perfect obedience to the Law does entirely recover God's
favor, through his sufferings does satisfy God's justice, through his death
acquit us from the guilt and punishment of, and for the first or original
sin, and he afterward rise again from the dead, as a Conqueror of Death and
sin; this one man's satisfaction and obedience is sufficient to blot out all
men's guilt, and merit God's favor and acceptance for all men; because as the
sin of one first man is the original cause of all our sins, and as his sin
is imputed to us, so the satisfaction of one second man (provided he be of the
same stock, that we are of) is enough to satisfy for the sin of that one
first man, and consequently also for the sins, which we have committed,
through the participation of that first sin; and his plenar obedience, if it
be imputed to us, as the first sin was, is sufficient to complete and perfect
all our imperfect good actions, and to make them theologically good. But some
may reply, That it is repugnant to man's nature, if he be of the same stock,
that we are of, to undergo death and rise again, or to be born without sin,
which is requisite; for otherwise how can he be thoroughly righteous? You have
great reason to doubt of this; for it is a mystery, which does exceed man's
capacity, and Col. 1. 26, 27.
is impossible for a natural man to dive into, or ever come to any particular
knowledge of it, unless immediately revealed by inspiration to some men, from
whom it should descend to us. Nevertheless this very thing is possible with
God, and therefore we ought not to doubt of it in the least, but according to
that divine saying of Solon, De Deo non est inquirendum sed credendum: We are
not to enquire of God, but to believe in him, and particularly in his mercy and
wisdom. This is the great mystery, ground and sum of our salvation.

III. But the main Question, that may be moved here, is, Whether this implicit
faith may be termed justifying, that is, Whether man in believing inclusively
in God's mercy and goodness, as including that God is most wise, and therefore
can order or appoint a means for his restoration and redemption, and that he is
merciful, and therefore will order and appoint those means of salvation to
such, who earnestly desire it, and believe in him. Mark I said also Goodness,
for that is necessary to be believed into, because although that through God's
mercy we are redeemed and restored to our primitive perfection, yet it is
through his goodness, or grace as Divines usually express it, that we abide
with him to all eternity.

To this may be answered, that it is not improbable: for, since it would be
impious to affirm, that all children are damned, because they have not an
actual faith, we may safely suppose, that God being infinitely merciful will
save them as far as they have an inclinative faith, or a disposition to it:
an actual faith cannot be required, because of their immaturity. If then
children are saved through their inclinative faith, certainly this
forementioned actual faith does counterpoize that of children. Besides, man in
believing according to the state of this Question, does his uttermost, and that
from a good principle to a good end, which questionless God will accept of.
Lastly, Men's consciences are even in this faith at rest and satisfied, and
their hopes are fixed: but all this cannot be in vain. Ergo.

IV. I thought it not amiss (although beyond my purpose) to add a Scripture
or two. Ezekiel. 18. 21, 22. But if the wicked will turn from all his sins, etc.

Romans 1 19, 20. Because that, which may be known of God is manifest in them;
for God has showed it unto them. For the invisible things of him, from the
creation of the world, are clearly seen, being understood by the things, that
are made, even his eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse.
Is not this a plain Text, testifying, that there is a natural faith in the
hearts of all men, or at least may be. Luc. 13. 3, 5. Acts 11. 18. 2 Corinthians.
7. 10. Psalm 36. 40. Prove. 26. 25. John 3. 3. Galat. 5. 6, etc.

This implicit faith is generally called faith in God, Heb. 6. 1. 2 Cor. 4. 3.
and many other places. Now to believe in God is to believe in him implicitly
and inclusively, that he is merciful and wise, and therefore can and will find
out a means of redemption.

Lastly, What was the faith of the Patriarchs in the Old Testament, but an
implicit or inclusive faith?

V. This accidentally, and now I go on to finish what belongs to practick
Faith: For observe, that Faith is either contemplative, which is a
contemplation or bare knowledge of the precedent, present, and future state of
man, and of a means of redintegrating his nature.

2. Or Practick, when we institute, that theory in action, which does
principally consist in applying its rules and Theorems to our selves in
particular. Now Faith in general and absolutely implies both in the same
manner; as Logic, which is a practick Science comprehends theoretick Logic
and practick Logic; the first being ordinarily called, Logica docens; the
latter Logica utens; and so we may say Fides docens, and Fides utens.

The general practick rules of Faith are these:

1. By such ways and means, as are like to those (in matter, but not in form)
whereby man fell into evil, man is to recover himself from it.

2. A man is to recover himself by insisting in the same way, but by contrary
steps, and using the same means, but in a contrary manner.

3. This contrariety of insisting and use, is a conformity to the insisting and
use of means of the first man before his defect.

VI. Man fell first by omitting the contemplation of God, but for a few
minutes, and by yielding to his sensual appetite, and the persuasion of the
evil spirit.

Pray observe here, that the condescending of the soul to the body was not a
sin: That being necessary; for how could man have eaten else? But the
condescending of the soul to the body to a bad end, or so, as to be taken with
the pleasures of it more than with its own, was a sin and caused his fall,
because the pleasures of the body, and those of the soul are contrary, the one
expelling the other; if you take delight in the meditation of divine things,
then the pleasures of the body are laid aside; or if in them of the body, then
God is put by. Again, pleasures or delights of the body, when the soul is
habituated to them, turn into passions: As for instance, If a man takes delight
in drinking, and often repeats that act, at last he will be besotted with a
doting love upon it, so as he will scarce be content, but when he is a
drinking. There are some men, whom it is no easy matter to find sober although
betimes in the morning; they drink all day, and go drunk to bed; they awake in
the morning half foxed, with their brains, yet dulled, scarce being cleared of
the last nights intemperance: presently after they call for a mornings draught,
and drink until noon, then sleep all dinner ^^ne, and in the afternoon go to
it again, and tipple until night, and so drink they the whole year about; if
at any time they are reproved for it, they will answer and swear to it, when
ever they leave off drinking they shall die. The like turning to passion you
may observe in all other pleasures.

VII. A man is to return by stepping backward out of the same ways and means:
as

1. Above all things he must bridle and constrain his passions, as love, anger,
hatred, etc. for by these the soul is altogether smothered up.

2. A passion seldom cease on a man, but it leaves a cindar, so that it
easily blazeth again.

3. A passion is abominable in God's sight: or nothing is more agreeing with
the nature of Devils, than always to be in a passion.

4. A man is no less justly taken for a beast, than so called in the vulgar
language: as when a man is taken notice of to dote upon a thing, people
compares him to an ass, and say, he is a doting ass: or when he is incensed
with hatred, they say, he is as full of hatred or venom as a Serpent: or when
he is inflamed with anger, they resemble him to the Devil, in saying, he is as
angry as a Devil.

5. The greatest advantage, which the Devil ever takes of men, is in their
passions. How many are there, that hang and murder themselves in wrath, love,
sadness, etc? How many are there killed through jealousy, hatred, or anger?

6. One passion seldom cease on a man without being accompanied with many
other vices and sins; in anger, love and hatred they are apt to lie, abuse,
murder, and what not?

7. A passionate man is by wise men accounted a fool: For it was one of the
tenants of the Stoics, That no wise man was passionate; and a very true saying
it is; for what foolish thoughts are men suggested with that are in love,
sorrow, anger, etc? You may object, That it is wisdom to love God. I answer,
That that love is no passion, because it lasts: besides, it is a necessary
property inhering in the soul, whereby it inclines to God with all her
faculties: therein she answers to her end, for which she was created, which is
to love God, or to be carried forth naturally to God. Neither is a Saints
hatred against the Devil a passion, but a natural aversion from him. Compassion
in a wise man is no passion, for it does not alter him, it is rather a quality
analogal to it, through which he succors a man in misery. A passion is
violent, and not lasting; the forementioned seeming passions are natural, and
therefore lasting: So that a wise man cannot be a wise man, and yet passionate,
because it perverts his reason, and detracts him from his meditations; and if
at any time a wise man happens to fall into a passion, for that time he is no
longer wise, but foolish, in declining toward his passions.

8. There is no passion but what is full of pain. All passions cause a violent
alteration, which doubtless must prove painful. Joy, which is supposed the
best of passions, is painful, it rendering a man restless, and full of
anguish, not knowing where to bestow himself. The like may be attributed to
Fear, Love, Anger, Sorrow, Hope, etc.

9. Passions are vain, fading away, and leaving no real good behind them. A
man, when his passion is over, wondreth how he could have been drawn into such
a passion. One that has been lately in love with any thing, after a while,
when that love to such an object is ceased in him, admireth at himself, how he
could have loved it; and so of all the rest.

10. All passions, whether good or evil, are redoubled with sorrow and
melancholy.

11. All passions are hurtful both to soul and body: to the soul, because she
thereby is taken off from her Summum Bonum: to the body, because passions do
dissipate or suppress the vital and animal spirits: whence we may observe,
that a passionate man is seldom long lived.

12. A passion is a great sin.

13. Most men are apt to shun others, that are passionate, or seem to be so.
For we commonly say, I care not for such a one, because he looks like an angry,
or spiteful man, or he looks like a doting fool.

14. Atheism is a collection of the habits of all passions in one man.

Wherefore it is necessary for a man, who endeavors to live eternally in
happiness with his Creator to wean himself from all passions whatsoever, and
shun them, as being most detestable.

VIII. Secondly, Pleasures of the body are to be waved and contemned as much as
possible: because by these man's soul was first drawn aside: Are we not apt to
shun and be a verse from any thing, that offended our bodies, or caused a
sickness? Much more ought we to shun that, which cast our souls into a mortal
disease. Pleasures of the body consist in the enjoyment of objects coveted by
our sensual appetite: but these are beyond necessity, or more than our bodies
require: for instance, to eat and drink of variety, or more than our natures
require, is counted a pleasure; but that is beyond necessity: So that all
pleasures are beyond necessity; Wherefore when we say such an one eats or
drinks for pleasure, that is, he eats or drinks beyond necessity, or more than
his nature requires. We must then also forbear going to see idle shows or
plays, for they rob our souls of her pleasure, and diverts her from
contemplating her Summum Bonum.

Pleasures in the forementioned sense differ from passions only (Secundum
magis and minus) more or less, since that each of them, if often repeated may
easily turn to a passion: how detestable they are has been showed already.

The pleasures of the body destroy both body and soul: their natural effects
enervate our strength; their moral ones damn our souls.

Bodily pleasures belong only to beasts, to those of the soul to men: Let us
not then be so foolish as to make an exchange. Pleasure is the Devils bait,
whereby he sweetly draws us to Hell. A bodily pleasure is also a great sin,
because thereby we do not answer the end of our Creation: Had the first man not
eaten more, than his nature required, or had he abstained from variety (both
which being pleasures) he could not have sinned; but eating beyond necessity,
he fell into a pleasure, and afterward into a passion by repeating the same
over and over again.

IX. Thirdly, You must resist the Devil with all your force, who, since you are
fallen back from his party, will prove no mean enemy to you; and therefore.

1. Consider where he intends to attack you, and be sure always to have a
Sentinel abroad, who may give you a timely alarm, when he approaches for to
make an assault upon you. Then, as a prudent Captain you are to know your
strength, and view your whole Fort; first, where you are the weakest; 2.
wherein your greatest strength lies, that so you may always be in a readiness
of relieving your Fortress. Besides, it will be a piece of prudence in you to
know whence to procure assistance, if upon occasion you should be fiercely set
upon. Your greatest weakness is in your outworks, which are your external
senses, and some of your in-works, as your sensual appetite, and internal
senses. Your greatest strength consists in your soul, namely in her reasoning
faculty and will. Your aid and assistance is God, whom you are constantly to
implore for succor and relief. Consider withal your enemies weapons,
wherewith he intends to encounter you: And lastly, take notice of his strict
discipline and policy in managing of his affairs, and therefore how much the
more ought you to bestir yourself, and look about you?

Now I will take leisure to unfold your weakness to all. There is never a
sense, but it has its weakness attending it.

1. The Eyes they are apt to be enchanted with shows and plays, and especially
such as are obscene: Your Ears with immodest discourse: Your Taste with
gluttony and drunkenness: Your Sent with noxious perfumes: And lastly, your
other Sense with lust.

All these are great and dangerous weaknesses. Are not some people so corrupt
and slavishly tied to see shows and plays, that there is n^^^r a day, but they
must see either a show, or a play; they dream of plays; they do constantly
talk of plays; and if there was but a fine show or play to be seen, the next
discourse is, what have you not seen such a show, such a rare play? Now mark
the Devils policy, there is never a tempting play or show, but the Devil sets
it off either by casting a luster upon their eyes, or a pleasantness upon the
gestures, a splendor upon the habit, and a clangour upon the speech of the
Actours: You cannot imagine how dead and simple a play would seem without the
Devils vernishing of it; and this is evident, many having seen rare plays,
upon whose eyes the Devils could not work, and to them they appeared as
nauseous and simple, as it proved admirable and rare to others, upon whose eyes
this gloss would take. The like may be said of painted or patcht faces; how
strangely are they set off with a gloss upon some men's eyes, and how ugly they
appear to others, whose eyes are incapable of a gloss? To these they seem like
a picture, or a patcht thing made up by Art; like to a hansome doublet with a
patch upon the elbow. And is not this a pretty stratagem of the Devils?

What a harmony does an immodest tale strike upon some men's ears? O pray, say
they, tell that once over again, it is one of the best that ever I heard! Do
you not think that the Devil gives a little touch here to, to set off this
melody? To others again it proves a harsh discord: so that while men play thus
upon the Organs, the Devil he blows the Bellows.

The Pallat or Taste is as ready to be enticed as any of the others. Pray
listen to a Drunkards story; I was yesterday, says he, at such a Tavern, and
there I had my fill of the best Canary in Town, and yet my head does not ach, a
sign of its excellency; come, let us go, and have another taste of it. Surely
the Devil did not neglect his opportunity in putting his paw into the cask to
set off the wine with a relish; and when he has caught a man in drunkenness,
how does he serve blasphemy out of his mouth? How does the Devil then ride him?
leads him by the nose whither he list; it may be directs him to a ditch, and so
he is drowned; or leaves him in a dead sleep in the highway, and there he is
robbed or murdered; or puts a sword into his hand to kill one or other, and so
he comes to the gallows, and thence home; or sends him to a naughty house, and
there he is infected with the Devils leprosy. How does the Devil perfume
women's looks to enchant men's nostrils? or what a nitour does he overshade their
faces with to raise men's lusts?

As for the weakness of your appetite, it is not hidden, when you do every day
feel its force and bending to evil objects: and lastly, how wickedly are men's
thoughts for the most part employed? In all these lies your weakness, and
there does the Devil most attack you. Now then the defensive part of this
military Art will lie in making your sallies upon the Devil, when you ever spy
him moving toward you.

If your eye is enticed with any thing, shut it or look another way, go from
it: and so do in the case of the other senses: For a retreat in these assaults
is as honorable as a resisting. Do not willingly or wittingly run into these
temptations, for your strength is but weak at the strongest. If nevertheless
thou art ex improviso encountered by any of the forementioned accidents, and
that thou art forced to withstand a repulse, direct your thoughts to the Summum
Bonum, and so undoubtedly you are in salvo.

Remember then that thou shunnest, contemnest, and go back from all such
objects, and persist in contemplating the Summum Bonum until the last: for
since the first man fell through waving this happiness but for a moment, thou
must surely he open to thy enemies, and be devoured by them, if thou set it
aside. Think that all bodily pleasures are torments in comparison to the
enjoyments of the soul.

X. Fifthly, We must return to our first operation of mind, which consists
mainly, as I hinted just now, in contemplating God, and admiring his Attributes
either immediately, or mediately through his wonderful works: so that what
ever object we behold, meditate or discourse of, we must behold, meditate, and
discourse of it, as created from God, and having a mark upon it of his
Omnipotence, Wisdom and Goodness. If we consider our selves, as first our
bodies, we cannot but remark its admirable structure and variety of organs, one
subserving the other, which reveals God's Omnipotence and Goodness, and
cannot but be a great happiness, if we do but reflect, that this God, who is
so Omnipotent, so Wise, and so Good is our God. When one hears that another,
who is his friend, and has a kindness for him, is promoted to great dignity
and power, how is he rejoiced at it, because now he is assured he has a friend
in power? but how much the more ought that man to be transported with joy, who
has God for his friend, whose friendship and power is infinite beyond
expression? Are we now so much astonished at the formation of the body, what may
we then be at the soul, by far exceeding the body? this consideration will be
enough to carry forth a man into an ecstasy. So likewise there is nothing
existent in the world, but its nature is so admirable, that we cannot but
admire God in it.

Here you may take notice of the erroneous and hard opinion the vulgar harbors
of those, that study Nature and natural bodies, meaning only Physicians. What
do they say of them? They study Nature so much, that they imagine that all
comes by nature. What a foolish saying? They would speak truer if they said,
they study nature so little, that they imagine, that all things rise from
themselves, and not from Nature. So that it is not the study of Nature, but the
ignorance of it protrudes them to Atheism. I have likewise ever observed, that
such, as asserted that blasphemy, were rash foolish fellows, having neither
skill or learning in them. This is a more frequent ignorance among Surgeons,
who thinking they know something, yet obstinately affect ignorance. What shall
I say, are there not some among them, who have not thought it a crime to speak
the greatest blasphemy of God and Christ, that tongue can express? Have the
same Atheists spared of spitting out their venomous treason against their
supreme Magistrate and Country, although afterward excusing themselves by
pretending it was out of policy? The pestilence of these fellows breaks out in
fiery heats, and botches in their butcherly faces. But God forbid all should be
so, many of that Profession being as knowing and religious as of any others.

XI. Sixthly, We are to persist herein until we are arrived to a complete
habit, for before we have attained to it, every evil act, although we have made
some progress, sets us very much back; yea sometimes renders us in as bad a
condition, as we were in before: in the same manner as when we are a rolling up
a great stone toward the top of a mountain, if we slip but a little, or do not
continue in our strength and roll on, the stone tumbles down again to the
bottom. Wherefore think that the least evil act, which you commit, sets you
back, and may endanger you of returning to your old condition; for as a stone
inclines naturally contrary ways to the force of the driver, so do we
naturally incline contrary ways to the motion of the good that is yet
remaining in us. Be sure then to persist and persevere in your labor, lest you
do labor in vain. Let what ever you think, speak, or do, have a relation or a
reflection to God, and so you shall soon come to the top of the hill, where you
shall have rest enough.

XII. If you perceive your strength begins to fail, which seldom is otherwise,
then pray to God, and constantly implore his aid and assistance; for without it
all our labor is labor in vain.

Here you may enquire, How one may know that God will be sought by prayer?

I answer, Nature does show us as much; for when ever misery does surprise us,
we do naturally, as if stirred through a necessary and forcing principle, call
upon God: and what is Nature but God's intended work?

2. It is consentaneous to the nature of misery, for that needs relief and
succor, which is no other way procured, than by zealous prayer: Possibly you
may suggest to your self, that it is to be got by praising God. By no means God
is not pleased with any praises, but of such, as are like to him; as for
others, they are an abomination to him. Praising denotes a gladness or joy,
which cannot he in any one, who is yet detained by his original misery. We must
therefore desire God to help us in striving and resisting against all bodily
pleasures and passions. I say strive; for we must labor hard, or else God will
scarce help us. And this was not unknown to the worst of Heathens, as their
common saying does witness, Dii laboribus omnia vendunt. The gods sell all
things for labor. When now you begin to feel your misery to be lessened, then
praise God with all your heart, and with all gladness for his Mercy and
Goodness extended toward you; and herein you are to abide for ever; for as
God's Mercy is without end, even so must you continue in praises without end.

Lastly, Beg of God to illuminate your understanding, that you may understand
all things more distinctly, thereby to admire God the more. And now you do
begin somewhat to resemble the first man in all his mental operations and
felicities. But the body still remaining unclean, it is necessary for the soul
to leave it for a while, that it may be purified through fire, with the rest of
the Elements, and so be made a fit palace to receive the soul in again. The
soul needs no purification, and therefore ascends directly to God's bosom.
So that I do much agree herein, that there is a Purgatory for the body, but
none for the soul.

XIII. Hereupon enquiry may be made, Whether the soul expiring out of the body,
and carried to God if Good, (or to the Devil if evil) is to be an Angel, or to
live with God for ever without any office: Or, Whether she is to be reunited
to the body, when purified. It is probable, that the soul deserting the body is
to be immediately an Angel, and to continue in office, until such time, that
the complete number of souls have likewise finished their course. I prove it. It
is improbable, that the soul should desist from serving God, and professing its
duty, because she was created for the same end.

Secondly, Her condition would exceed that of Angels, were she exempted from
all duty, these being also created for God's service: for Spirits are called
Angels from their Office, which is to serve God. The word is derived from
(...), denoting a messenger, which again from (...), I send. The Office, which
the separated soul is capable of exercising, is of taking care of souls yet in
the body, in helping and assisting them; for as the Devil does seduce us by
depraving our appetites and fancies, so to the contrary do Angels enlighten our
understandings, and suppress our immoderate appetites.

XIV. This office they shall remain in until the consummation of the world, at
which time every soul shall be reunited to its body now purified by fire, and
transformed into a splendid substance. All the Elements shall then be sublimed
into a pure nature, and all other things else shall return to what they were at
the time of the first man's innocence. Beasts shall receive new natures, their
wild ones shall become tame and obedient to man as formerly. The poisonous
herbs shall be changed again into wholesome. All flowers shall re-indue their
primitive fragrancy: Summarily all men, that shall escape the terror of that
great day of judicature, shall be placed in the same state and Paradise, which
the first man enjoyed, and the same Law shall be imposed upon men, as before.
Man shall abide eternally in Paradise: he shall eat and drink, but he shall not
generate. The great instrument and cause of man's redemption shall eternally
reign over him. Here I have described man's second Paradise; there remains only
the proof of its particulars.

1. That the separated soul shall be reunited to its body is apparent, because
God created her at first with a natural propensity to the body, and that she
should be a perfection to it, which propensity is yet remaining in her, because
God does not recall any thing, that he does, or has done. This propensity is a
certain sign, that God will raise up its body again otherways it would be in
vain. The body ('it is likely) will be the same (Quoad formam accidentalem and
figuram) according to its precedent form, shape and figure, because thereby the
saved souls may know one another again, when they meet in Paradise, and rejoice
together, always praising God for his mercy and goodness.

XV. The soul being now returned to its body, must be contained by a corporeal
place. This corporeal place must be a Paradise upon earth, because God did
first bestow it upon man, as being agreeable to his integrity and perfection;
and of the other side, as being consentaneous to God's infinite goodness,
through which he conferred a complete and entire happiness upon man. The same
now remaining, to wit man's perfection and God's goodness, it is certain, that
he will confer the same happiness upon man, namely Paradise; because God in
his wisdom finding it to be suitable to man then, will ordain the same again
now, his wisdom being the same.

If God then is pleased to confer the same Paradise upon man, it is evident,
that all the Elements shall be purified, otherwise how could it be a fit place
for to embrace so pure a substance? The same Law, it is probable shall continue,
because the same obedience and duty will be required from man as before.
Beasts, Herbs and Flowers the second Paradise shall abound with; because God
judged it convenient before, and therefore his wisdom being unchangeable will
judge the same then. He shall eat and drink, because otherwise the fruits of
Paradise, and man's nutritive organs should be in vain. He shall not generate,
because the number of men will be completed. The cause and instrument of our
Redemption was an entirely righteous and effentially holy man; yet more than a
man, for it was impossible, for man alone to satisfy God's justice: since then
the chief instrument of our salvation was a man, his body being of the same
nature with others, must require a corporeal place: but of this little can be
said, since man through his reason cannot dive unto it, neither is it revealed,
unless obscurely. A description of the second Paradise you may also read in
Isa. 65. 17, 18, 19, etc. and in the next ensuing Chapter. 2 Pet. 3. 13 and in
the 21, and 22 Chapter of the Revelat.


What shall I say more to you, O, that most splendid second Paradise, abounding
with innumerable springs of ineffable joys! This is the Palace, whither the
victorious Soul shall be conducted by a number of glorious Angels to the
greatest of Kings, attended by myriads of Cherubims, there, in the sight of
them all to receive the Laurel, and to be installed into an everlasting
dignity, office, and possession. Thence she takes her place among those
illustrious attendants, and sings Hymns to the melodious ear of the chief
Musician. O hear their sweet noise ring, Gloria, Gloria Deo in excelsis. Te
Deum laudamus in aeternum. O the harmony of their quavering wings and smooth
voices! O the glorious order in their moving! O the splendor that encompasseth
them! O the glistering of their appearances! O those bright Stars moving
swister than the Heavens! O the ^lustery descent of the myriads of Seraphims,
then of Cberubims, and of Thrones! O but what misery is it to be shut out from
this celestial consort, and have ones brains dashed against the fiery pins, and
burning stakes of Hell? Woe the most horrible sight of that monstrous Arch-devil
Satan, piercing the most tender sinews of man with his serpentine tongue,
haling each limb of him with so many. Drakes heads: scruing his conscience, by
trusting his eyes into that dread magnifying glass of Hell, which serves him
to shake his shattery bones, through seeing the monstrous greatness of his
sins. Woe that multiplying Glass expressing the vast number of his detestable
wicked deeds. Woe the fearful thunder of those innumerable legions of wretches
roaring out through the most intolerable pains of their sinews, the rigid
torments and the gnawing, fretting, distracting, inflaming Gangrene of their
sad consciences. Woe the everlasting pricking, pinching, convulsion, rotting of
their sinews. Woe the deformity of their ulcer'd, swelled, rankled bodies. Woe
the fearful spectacle and disorder of hellish monsters! here is a fiery
Serpent, there a roaring Lion; here stands a dreadful Drake formed out of the
body of an Atheist, there a raging Crocodile grown up out of the body of a
Traitor. Woe the unexpressible innumerable torments and dreads of Hell.

And this you see is the end of Good and Evil, and of this Treatise.

CHAP. XXII. Comprizing a brief account of the Religion of the Heathen
Philosophers.
1. Socrates his belief of God. 2. What God is according to Homer. 3. What
Plato thought God to be. 4. Thales his saying of God. 5. Instances proving the
Heathens to have known Gods Attributes; particularly, That Thales believed
God's Omniscience, and God's unchangeable Decrees. 6. That Socrates asserted
God's Omniscience, Omnipotence, his creating of the world in time, his justice
and mercy, God's Omnipresence. 7. The Articles of Plato 's Faith, 8. Aristotle
's Belief. 8. Virgil 's opinion of divine things. 10. The divine Song of
Orpheus, 11. Trismegistus upon the Creation of the world.


AFter the proposal of a Rational Divinity, and its evidence through humane
Reason, it will not a little conduce to the proof thereof, that Heathens have
through the light of Nature attained to the same.

I. Socrates, who might more justly be surnamed Divine, than his Scholar Plato
(who received most of his learning from him) constantly used to say, That the
only amiable wisdom was to know and understand God and Nature; which knowledge
(says he) was not be got in men, but it was called to mind; as if he would
have said, the soul must needs retain some impression from whence it was
derived. He asserted also, That the supreme God was the Father and maker of all
things.

II. Homer declared God the Father of all the gods which are created, and maker
of beasts, and all other things that had no souls. By gods here he meant men,
who for their excellency of wit and parts, were after their death remembered
with Sacrifices, and honored with the name of gods. Neither did men really
take these for gods, but only in the same manner as Papists do their Saints;
for they were not ignorant that these had been men, and could then perform no
more than men. Hence Heraclitus affirmed, That this world was not made by any
of the gods or men.

III. Plato his assertion was, That God of all causes was the most excellent,
and the first.

IV. God, says Thales, is the most ancient of things, for he never had
beginning or birth. Stob. Sermon. 109.


V. Now I come to produce, that they had attained a particular knowledge of
God's Attributes.

Thales being demanded, whether a man might do ill and conceal it from God: no
nor think it, said he.

Stobaeus relates of Thales, that he being asked what was the strongest,
answered Necessity, for it rules all the world. Necessity is the firm judgment
and immutable power of Providence. A golden saying inverting Fate into God's
unchangeable Decree.

VI. Socrates his knowledge of God was after this tenor: viz.

That God knows all things, said, done, or silently desired. Xen. Mem. 1, 4.


That God through his care sustains all his creatures, in providing light,
water and fire for them. But particularly for man, for whose service and
subjection he has ordained plants and all other creatures.

That God is one, perfect in himself, giving the being and wellbeing of every
creature; what he is I know not, what he is not I know.

That the way to true happiness is Philosophy, whose precepts are two, to
contemplate God, and to abstract the soul from corporeal sense.

That God, not Chance created the world and all creatures, is evident, through
the reasonable disposition of their parts, as well for use as defense, from
their care to preserve themselves, and continue their kind: That he has had a
particular regard to man in his body, is no less apparent from the excellency
thereof above others; from the gift of speech, from the excellency of his soul
in Divinations, and fore-saying dangers: That he regards particular beings,
from the care of their whole kind: That he will reward such as please him, and
punish others that displease him, from his power of doing it, from the belief
he has ingraffed in man: That he will do it: That he is professed by the most
wise and civilized Cities and Ages: That he at once sees all things, from the
instances of the eye, which at once over-runs many miles; and of the mind,
which at once conceives things done in the most remote places: Lastly, That he
is such, and so great, as that he at once sees all, hears all, is every where,
and orders all.

Plato maintains, That God is incorporeal and an unchangeable Light. That the
knowledge of God was the true Plat. dc Repub. l. 6.
wisdom, and that we are rendered like to God through our justice and holiness.

What says Austin concerning Plato? That his followers Lib. de Relig. c. 9.
would have been Christians, a few words and sentences only being changed.

That the greatest happiness consisted in knowing God, and Phaed.
in being like to him.

But possibly you may reply, That Plato (according to what Just. Mart. or at.
Paraenet. ad Gent.
is asserted by Justin Martyr) had read some Books written by an inspired pen,
as the Books of Moses and the Prophets. Unde Plato (inquit) currum volantem
Jovem agere in Coelo didicit, nisi ex Prophetarum Historiis, quas evolverit?
Intellexit enim e Prophetae verbis, quae de Cherubim it a script a sunt, and
gloria Dom ini ex domo exivit venitque in Cherubim, sumserunt Cherubim pennas
suas, and rotae eorum cohaerebant, Dominique Dei Israel eis in Coelo coharebat
gloria. Hinc profectus Plato clamat his verbis: Magnus in Coelo Jupiter currum
volantem incitans; alioquin a quo alio nisi a Mose and Prophet is haec
didicisset?

Whence (says he) had Plato learned that Jupiter rid in a flying Chariot, but
out of the Histories of the Prophets, which he had over-lookt? for out of the
Books of the Prophets he understood all those things, that were thus written
concerning the Cherubims: and the glory of the Lord went out of the house, and
came to the Cherubims. The Cherubims took their feathers, and they hung
together in circles, and the Glory of the Lord of Israel, did abide upon them
in Heaven. Hence Plato descending cries out these words: Jupiter great in the
Heavens driving his flying Chariot. Otherwise from whom should he else have
learned these things, but from the Prophets?

And so Clem. Alexand. lib. 1. Strom. orat. ad Gent. speaking as it were to
Plato. Leges, quaecunque verae sunt, tibi ab Hebrais suppeditatae sunt. What
ever true Laws thou have set down are supplied thee by the Hebrews.

To this I answer, That it is very improbable, that Plato should have collected
his Divinity out of Moses or the Prophets, their writings being in his time not
yet translated out of the Hebrew. I should rather believe with others, that he
had sifted his divine Notions out of Hermes Trismegistus an Egyptian, who
according to Suidas, flourished before Pharho, and was called Trismegistus,
because he had through a divine inspiration written of the Trinity. And Sugul
says, that he was called Ter optimus maximus, the thrice best and greatest,
because of his greatest wit, or according to others, because he was a Priest,
King, and a Prophet.

It Is not only thought of Plato, that he had gathered some riddles of God from
the AEgyptans, but also of Theodorus, Anaxagoras, and Pythagoras. But I
continue Plato's sentences.

The body being compounded is dissolved by death, the soul being simple passes
into another life, and is incapable of corruption. Plat. Phaed.


The souls of men are divine, to whom, when they go out of the body, the way
of their return to Heaven is Cicer. do amic.
open, for whom to be best and most just is most expedient.

The souls of the good after death are in a happy state, united Plat. Phaed.
to God in a blessed inaccessible place; the wicked in convenient places suffer
condign punishment. But to define what those places are, is (...): Whence being
demanded, what things were in the other world? he answered, Neither was I ever
there, or ever did speak with any, that came from thence.

VIII. We must not forget Aristotle, who lib. 3. de anim. c. 3. closes with
Homer in these Verses. (...),
(...)
(...).


And Homer agreed in the same, That the minds of mortal men were such as the
Father of Gods and men did daily infuse into them. Moreover lib. 1. de anim.
cap. 3. t. 65, 66. he calls our understanding Divine, and asserts it to be
without danger of perishing. And lib. 2. de gener cap. 3. delivers his sense
thus, (...). Wherefore it remains, that the mind alone does advene from
without, and that she alone is Divine; for the action of the body has not at
all any communication with her action.

IX. Virgil 4. Georg. wittily sets down God's ubiquity,

-- Deum namque ire per omnes
Et terras tractusque Maris, Coelumque profundum.
Hinc pecudes, armenta, viros, genus omne ferarum,
Quemque sibitenues nascentem arcessere vitas.
Et 6. AEneid.

Principio Coelum, ac terras composque liquentes,
Lucentemque Globum Lunae, Titaniaque astra.
Spirit us intus alit totamque infusa per artus
Men's agitat molem, and magno se corpore miscet. That is,
For God does go through all the earth, the tracts of the Sea, and the deep of
the Heavens. Hence do beasts and men and what ever is born draw their thin
breath.

And in the sixth Book of his AEneids.

In the beginning God created Heaven and Earth, and the melting fields, and the
shining Globe of the Moon, together with the Titanian Star. A spirit does
nourish it within (speaking of the world) and a mind being infused through its
members does move its mole, and mingles its self with that great body.

X. The admirable Poesy of that Divine Orpheus, lib. de Mundo, is worth our
observation.

(...).
(...).
(...).
(...).
(...).
(...),
(...),
(...)
(...).
Jupiter is the first, Jupiter is the last. Jupiter is the head, Jupiter is the
middle.

God made all things. Jupiter is the foundation of the earth, and of the starry
heavens.

Jupiter is a male, Jupiter is an immortal Nymph.

Jupiter is the spirit of all things, Jupiter is the mover of the unruly fite.

Jupiter is the root of the Sea. Jupiter is the Sun and the Moon.

Jupiter is a King. Jupiter is the sulminating Prince of all, for he covers
all, he is a lighr to all the earth, out of his breast he does wonderful
things.

XI. Trismegistus lib. 1. Pimandr. renders himself very divinely. The mind of
the divine power did in the beginning change its shape, and suddenly revealed
all things, and I saw that all things were changed into a very sweet and
pleasant light. And below in another place: A certain shadow fell underneath
through a thwart revolution. And Sermon. 3. Pimandr. The shadow was infinite in
the deep: but the water and the thin spirit were in the chaos: and there
slourished a holy splendor, which impelled the Elements under the sand and the
moist nature, and the weighty bodies being submerst under the darkness did
abide under the moist sand.

Empedocles defined God a sphere, whose center is every where, and
circumference no where. Vincent. in spec. hist. l. 4. c. 44.

Pythagoras described God to be a mind diffused throughout the universal parts
of the world, and the whole nature, out of Lactant. l. 1. c. 5.
which all living creatures that are born, do draw their life. In another place
he calls him (...): The soul of the universe.

Heraclitus being at a certain time of the winter crept into a Cottage for to
warm himself, and being enquired for by some, Arist. l. de par. animal. c. 5.
who were ashamed to come into so mean a place, called to them to come near;
for (said he) the gods are also to be found here.

Athenagoras an Athenian Philosopher expresses himself very profoundly: God
(says he) has given man a judgment of reason and understanding for to know
intelligible things, the Goodness of God, his Wisdom and Justice.

in Flanders.

Natural Philosophy. The SECOND PART. The First Book.
CHAP. I. Of the Nature of Natural Philosophy.
1. The Etymology and Synonima's of Natural Philosophy. 2. The Definition of
Natural Philosophy. 3. An Explanation of the said Definition. 4. What a Natural
Being is. 5. What a Natural Essence is. 6. What Nature is. 7. The various
Acceptions of Nature.


NAtural Philosophy is so called, because it treats of Nature, and Natural
Beings. It is also known by the name of Physics, which is derived from (...),
Nature. Aristotle in his Metaphysics, Book 6. Chap. 1. calls it the second
Philosophy. Cicero in his Book of Divin. names it (...), that is, a Discourse
of nature.

II. Natural Philosophy is a Knowledge of a Natural being.

III. This Definition stateth a Natural being to be the Subject of Physics,
which is somewhat restricted from a being in general, as being less universal,
and therein it is distinguished from Metaphysics, where a being is discoursed
of, as a most universal Entity; but here, as a less. Natural in the Definition
does lay a restriction upon a being, and gives it a specific consideration;
and therefore it proves trustraneous to add (quatenus natural) as far as it is
natural: for otherwise, what need would there be to appose Natural, did it not
imply the same? Or in case you omit Natural, you may define natural Philosophy
to be a knowledge of a being so far as it is natural, and so it is the same
again. Here you may take Astronomy to be coincident with Physics, because it
treats of the Heavens, which are natural beings. Herein I do resolve you
thus: Astronomy is not a knowledge of the Heavens; for a knowledge does explain
a thing through its Causes and Affections: but Astronomy does not treat of the
Causes of the Heavens; wherefore it follows that Astronomy is not a proper
Science of the Heavens. Although Astronomy contains the Doctrine of the
Motion of the Heavens, which is only an Affection or Property of the Heavens;
yet therein it does not constitute a Science, unless in an improper, although
usual signification, wherein Science is taken for any kind of Knowledge, be it
of the Causes, or Affections of a thing; be it Theoretick, or Practick; and
according to this Acception is the Art of Grammar frequently called a Science.
Astronomy is a partial Science, or it is a part of the Science of Physics, as
discoursing of one of the affections of a natural being, which is the Motion of
the Heavens. But since each of these partial Sciences, if treated of all in one
Volume, would grow to a vast Mole, Philosophers do therefore handle them in
several Books, and Treatises.

IV. A Natural being is that, which consists of Nature, or which has a
Natural Essence.

V. A Natural Essence is that, which consists of Natural parts; namely,
natural Matter, and natural Form.

VI. Nature is a disposition of an Elementary being, whereby it does act
according to its truth.

I say it is a Disposition, and therefore no power, because all dispositions
are Actual.

VII. Nature is variously taken. 1. For a single Essence, exempted from all
Composition, according to which sense God is only called Nature; and for to
distinguish his Nature from others, he is called (Natura Naturans) Nature
naturating; or nature, which gives nature to all other natures. 2. It is also
taken for a derived being, which is distinctly specified by (Natura Naturata)
Nature naturated; or for nature, which has obtained its nature from the
naturating nature. 3. For the Quiddity and Essence of a natural being; and
according to this last acception it is to be taken here.

As God alone is called Nature according to the first acception, so are Angels
and Souls, that are separated from their Bodies, called in a sense common to
Elementary beings, Nature. But Nature in the third signification is only
appropriated to Elementary beings.

I omit the mentioning many other Acceptions of Nature, because they are
inclusively contained in these beforementioned.

CHAP. II. Comprehending an Explanation of the Definition of a Natural Being.
1. What is meant by disposition. 2. An Objection against the Definition of a
Natural being Answered. 3. What it is to act according to Truth. 4. That the
Subject of this Science is more properly named a natural Being, than a natural
Body. 5. Aristotle's Definition of Nature rejected by several Arguments. 6. That
Nature is a property of a Natural being. 7. The difference between Nature and
Art. 8. That Nature in respect to God acts constantly for an End. 9. The
Division of Nature.


I Come now to explain the Definition of Nature, which Explanation is the more
necessary, because through its obscurity many doubts, and mistakes might
otherwise be occasioned.

The Genus is a Disposition or Virtue, which you are to take here in a concrete
consideration, according to the sense expressed in the Third Chapter of Powers.
By virtue I intend an actual strength and power of acting, as it is inherent in
a natural subject.

II. Against my Definition may be Objected, That Nature its Substance: but a
Disposition or Virtue is an Accident: Therefore it cannot be the right Genus.
To this I Answer, That Virtue is a Property of a being, not really distinct
from it, but modally only: now since we can only know a thing by its Modes, as
does appear in my Metaphysics; therefore beings for the understandings sake
are to be explained by them, and are to be taken to be the same really with
their subject. A Disposition then is the same, as if I had said a Subject, or
being disposed and powerful.

Through Elementary being is meant, a being constituted by the Elements;
wherein I do distinguish natural beings, as they are the subject of this
Science, from the nature of Angels and separated Souls, which are immaterial,
and not constituted through the Elements, as Origin did falsely suppose.

III. To act according to its Truth, is to act conformably to the Divine
purpose and Idea, whereby beings do act the same, and are the same, which God
did purpose they should act, and intend they should be: To be the same being,
is to be that, which they are, and act that, which they do act; Where observe,
that nature is the Seal and Impression of Gods Will and Omnipotence upon every
being, through which they are that, which they are. Hence Nature is called the
Hand of God. Hence it is also called the Order and universal Government among
all natural beings, through which one being does depend upon the other, and is
useful and necessary to the other. This is evident in many moving living
Creatures, as most Cattle, whose dependence and Preservation is from and
through Vegetables; as from Herbs; theirs again is from the juice of the earth;
and that from a mixture of all the Elements. The same subordinate use and good
is also observed among all other beings in the world. Hence nature is called
the strength and virtue of a being; for their strength and virtue is nothing
else but an actual disposition and propension in beings; In this sense we say
the nature of fire is to levitate, of earth to gravitate.

IV. I did rather choose to say a natural being, then a natural body, for to
avoid an improperty of speech; because a body is properly and ordinarily taken
for matter; and so we usually say, that man consists of a Soul and body, and
that a natural being consists of a form and body, or matter. Neither is it a
motive, rather for to say a natural body, then a natural being: because a being
is of too large an extent; for a being is restricted from that Latitude of
signification by adding natural.

V. After the exposition of this Definition of nature, it will not be amiss to
compare that of Aristotle's to it. Nature is the Principle of Motion and rest of
a being, wherein it is existent through it self, and not by accident.

It was the Opinion of Aristotle, that nature was a substance, and nevertheless
here he seems to make an Accident of it; for that, which acts immediately
through it self, is not a substance, but an Accident, because according to his
dictates, a substance does not act immediately through it self, but through its
accidents; if then a natural being acts through its nature, that is, its
Matter and Form, then nature must be an accident, and consequently matter and
form are also accidents, which he did in no wise intend.

2. Suppose that nature were a substance, it would be absurd to assert, that a
natural being did act through a substance of rest and motion, which does inhere
in it self; for then there would be a penetration of bodies, and an
Identification of Subsistencies.

You may reply, That nature is not a substance of motion and rest, but a
substantial Principle. Pray, what is a substantial Principle but a substance?

3. It is plainly against the Principles of Aristotle, to say, that a Principle
is no substance; for Matter and Form are Principles, but these he grants to
be substances.

4. If again granted, that these are substances, and not virtues, then it must
necessarily follow, that a Form being an active Principle, does act through it
self, and thence a Form is called active. It must also follow, that Matter,
which is another Principle of motion, acts efficiently withal, because motion
proceeds from an Efficient or from a Form, and wherefore is Matter then
called a passive Principle? Your Answer to this will be, that Matter is not the
Principle of Motion, but of Rest. I take your Answer, but what kind of rest do
you mean? Is it a rest from local Motion, or a rest from Alteration, or
Augmentation? It must be a rest from some of these three. It cannot be a rest
from local motion, because all beings are not capable of a rest from local
motion: then it must be a rest from alteration, or augmentation. Neither can it
be a rest from any of these; For all beings are constantly and at all times in
alteration, and consequently are either augmented, or diminished. What rest can
it then be?

It is no rest from Action, for then matter could be no Principle or cause, for
all causes do act.

5. How can Matter and Form, which are Principles, before their union, be
substances, since that a substance is a perfect being, which does subsist in
unity through it self, and thereby is distinct from all other beings: but
matter or form can neither of them subsist through themselves, or have any
unity, or distinction.

6. A Form is not a Principle of rest in all natural bodies through it self,
but by accident: for all bodies are through themselves continually in motion,
as will further appear in its proper place.

VI. Wherefore for to avoid all these Absurdities, Contradictions, and
Improperties of Speech, it is necessary to assert;

1. That Nature is a Property of a natural being, through which it acts.

2. That a Property is really Identificated with its subject, and consequently,
that Natural is not really differing from a natural body. This property denotes
a propension, or actual disposition, through which the said body is rendered
active. By activeness I understand whereby all is constituted, whatever is
actually inherent in a being, as, Existence, Subsistence, and all its other
Properties; so that Nature or Natural in Physics is a Property equivalent to
the Modes or Attributes of Truth, and Goodness in Metaphysics.

VII. Nature differs from Art, in that she acts conformably to the Divine
Idea or Intention, but Art acts conformably to the intellectual Idea:
Wherefore nature is infallibly immutable, constant, perpetual, and certain,
because it depends from an infallible, immutable, constant, perpetual, and
certain Cause; but Art is fallible, changeable, inconstant, and uncertain,
because it depends from the humane Intellect, which is fallible, changeable,
inconstant, and uncertain. As man is incapable of acting without God, so is Art
incapable of effecting any thing without Nature. Nature is infinitely beyond
Art: What Art is there, which can produce the great world, or any thing
comparable to the little world? Whatever excellent piece a man does practice
through Art, it is no further excellent, then it is like unto Nature; neither
can he work any thing by Art, but what has nature for its Pattern. What is it
a Limner can draw worthy of a man's sight, if natural beauties are set aside?

VIII. Whatever nature acts, it is for an End and Use: It is for an end in
respect to God, who created all things for an end; it is for an use, in respect
to one another, because all beings are useful to one another, as I have
formerly demonstrated: but we cannot properly say, that all things act for an
end in respect to one another, because that, which does act for an end, is
moved by that end, and does foreknow it; but natural beings do not foreknow
their ends, neither are they moved by them.

IX. Nature is either universal, or singular.

An universal nature may be apprehended in a twofold sense. 1. For the Universe
or whole world, containing all singular natures within it. 2. For a nature,
which is in an universal being, and so you are to take it here.

A Singular nature is, which is inherent in every singular and Individual being.

I do willingly pass by other Observations concerning Nature in general,
because I have touched many of them in my Metaphysics.

CHAP. III. Of the Principles of a Natural Being.
1. That Privation is no Principle of a Physical Generation, or of a Physical
Being. That Union might be more properly termed a Principle, then Privation. 2.
The Principles of a Material being stated by Pythagoras rejected. 3. That to
treat of Matter and Form is more proper to Metaphysics. 4. That the Materia
Prima of Aristotle is a Non Ens. 5. That the Chaos had a Form. 6. The Authors
Materia Prima. 7. That it does not appertain to Physics to explain the nature
of the first Matter. 8. What the first Form of all natural beings is.


I. IN Metaphysics it is made known, that all created beings consist of Parts,
and that no being, except God alone, is single, but all are compounded. This is
also proper to a natural being, whose composition is to consist of Matter and
Form. I need not tell you the diversity of Opinions among Philosophers upon
this Particular, they being fully related by Aristotle, in his Physical
Auscultations; wherefore I shall only examine his, as being thought the most
Authentic by modern Philosophers. The said Philosopher states three
Principles, which do necessarily concur to the Production of a natural being:
namely, Matter, Form and Privation. As for two of them, no doubt, but they are
principles, but the third is disputable. Privation is Logical, that is, it is
imaginary, and assinged to a being by a second intention of the mind, and
therefore his Commentators do generally teach, that it is to be counted no
other then a principle per accidens. If per accidens, it is no part of a being:
if it is any thing, it is a part of Generation, for this does immediately
presuppose a privation, but a being presupposes it mediately only, through,
and by means of Generation. If the, call that a principle of Generation, which
does necessarily concur to the constitution of a natural being, then that
should rather be termed a principle, which does concur to it per se, as for
Instance, union. Union does necessarily and per se concur to the generation of
a natural being, but privation does only concur to it per accidens.

Union is not only necessary at the moment of Generation, but also after a
being is constituted; it is that, without which a being cannot consist. So that
I say, that union is infinitely more proper to be termed a principle then
privation, and why did not Aristotle dream of that ^ To speak properly, neither
of them can be taken for a Principle of a natural being, whereby it should be
constituted to be that which it is. Union is unnecessary, because unity does
imply it; since then that all beings are metaphysically constituted by an
unity, which can be also applied to Physics, it is needless to mention union
in this Science, otherwise we might aequo jure refer all the Modes of a being
to it.

I much strange, why Aristotle omitted the inserting Privation in Metaphysics
among the universal causes of an universal being, and why he did not as justly
refer it to that part of Philosophy, as he did Matter and Form; it being of as
large an extent and universality, as either of these. Possibly you will deny it
to be of an equal extent with them, or assert, that it is of no larger
universality then a natural being is. Herein I deny your denial and assertion;
for it is of a larger extent then a natural body is, since it is appliable to
Angels, and Devils, who must as necessarily have had a privation for a
principle of Generation as Naturals, for even they were not before they were.
Wherefore since he referred Angels and Devils to Metaphysics, he ought aequo
jure to have placed privation in the same Rank. The same Argument I may use
against his eight Books of Physics, there being little else contained in them
but what is as common to spiritual beings as to corporeal; as for Instance,
Time, Finiteness, Motion, etc. all which are common to immaterial beings.
Wherefore had Aristotle treated of these Particulars in his Physics, Doctrine
gratia, it might have deserved an excuse, but since he t^eated of, them there
per se, it can be accounted no less then an Error.

II. Pythagoras taught a Trinal Number of Principles, constituting a material
being. 1. A Point. 2. A Line. 3. A Superficies, or Surface. These are rather
sorts and kinds of quantity, which for that reason do more properly appertain
to Metaphysics; for besides these, there are many others concurrent to the
constitution of a material being, as has been disputed of elsewhere. Yet this
is observable in this Opinion, that Pythagoras and many other wise men did
collect the principles of a being, by means of their senses; for it is in vain
to talk of Essences and Forms, in such a manner as Aristotle did, which a man
cannot apprehend, what they are; and for this reason he stated three principles
of a material body, because these three could be evidently perceived by sense.

III. To treat of Matter and Form does rather belong to Metaphysics, because
they are principles remote from physical bodies; I say they are remote, because
they are applied to natural bodies by means of the Elements: for natural bodies
consist of Matter and Form, so far as they consist of the Elements, and the
Elements are really and properly the Matter and Form of a natural being. Now,
in every Science the Principia proxima are only to be treated of, for otherwise
you might draw all Metaphysics to this Tract. Aristotle did erroneously
discourse of these things in Physics, since he had treated of them in
Metaphysics. My purpose was no other then to rehearse these matters for an
Introduction, and to show the mistakes of others herein.

IV. Matter in a natural being is either first or second. The first matter is,
which is not produced out of any other, and therefore is termed to be
ingenerable and incorruptible. The second matter is, which is produced out of
the first, and is said to be generable and corruptible. Aristotle in his 1 Book
of Phys. C. 9. T. 82. defines the first matter to be the first Subject of
every thing, out of which remaining, a being is generated through it self, and
not by accident. The ancient Philosophers could hardly understand, what this
first matter was, because of its difficulty; wherefore Aristotle himself was
forced to describe it negatively, in the 1 B. of Metaph. Chapter 3. T. 8. The first
matter is that, which through it self has neither essence, nor quantity, nor
any thing of that, by which a being is determined: which is as much as if he
said, I know better what it is not, then what it is; and this kind of knowledge
is common to Fools and Wise men. So that from this Description we may collect,
that it is not cognoscible, since it is not determined, and consequently it is
nothing. Notwithstanding Aristotle recollects himself in his Physics, where we
have the forementioned Definition set down. The first matter, says he, is the
first subject of everything: Ergo every thing is generated out of the first
matter: How can that be? Then it follows, that every natural being, when it
is dissolved, is dissolved in its first matter; or, how can the next being be
generated out of it else? This most of his Followers do deny, affirming the
contrary, viz. That a natural being through its corruption is not dissolved
into the first matter. This they prove by Aristotle his own Dictates; the
corruption of one being is the generation of another. Generation, says
Aristotle, is in an instant: that is, as soon as one form goes out, at the same
instant, another enters.

2. If a being in its dissolution is dissolved into the first matter, then it
must be deprived from all its Accidents: but we observe the contrary, for when
a beast dies, there still remain Accidents in that body: Ergo a being is not
dissolved into the first matter. This moved Aristotle to assert the
forementioned Theoremes, to wit, That Generation is in an instant, and that the
corruption of one being is the generation of another, because there are
Accidents remaining at the same instant, when the precedent form is expelled;
which Accidents remaining, do necessarily suppose a form, from which they are
depending. All which infers, that every thing is generated out of the second
matter, and not out of the first. How then can Materiaprima be said the first
subject of every thing?

The other part of the Definition is, out of which a being is produced: this is
no less strange then the other. How can a being be produced, and yet the first
matter be remaining? For as soon as a being is produced, the first matter is not
remaining, but it is now become a second matter with Accidents, which were not
in the first.

V. It is more then probable, that naturally and really there is no such first
matter.

1. Because all natural beings are generated out of a pre-existent Matter; this
our sense does testify; as for Aristotle's first matter, that has no
Existence, but an imaginary Essence only.

2. All, that which does really exist, is a compounded being. If there is any
such single matter, how do you know it? Sense never perceived it, how can you
then tell it? Whatever does exist, or did ever exist, it has, or had a Form.
You may say, that the Chaos existed without a Form, because a Form does
distinguish a being from all others, and gives it unity: Now, when the Chaos
existed, there was no other being, and it was rude and without form. To this, I
Answer, Although there was no other being, yet this did not hinder, but that
the Chaos had its numerical and positive unity, existence, determination,
goodness, truth, etc. all which Accidents could not be without a Form. It Is
said, that the Chaos had no form, that is, not its formaultima, for which it
was intended, notwithstanding it had its Forma prima. It remains then, that
the materia prima is neither an objective being, nor much less a real being: It
is no Objective being, because we cannot frame an object of it, or like to it.
For what can we think of it; it is confessed it has neither Essence, or
Quantity, etc. The greatest Absurdity is, that they give it no limitation, and
consequently must affirm it to be infinite, which of all absurdities is the
most absurd: for nothing is infinite, but God alone. Then again, to maintain
that it is ingenerable and incorruptible, is impious: for God only is
ingenerable, and incorruptible.

VI. There is a first matter, which was produced at first, and out of which all
second matters were and are generated. This first matter had also a first Form
comproduced with it.

A Second matter is, which is produced out of the first.

The first matter is the matter of the Elements, which are four in number.

You are to note here, that by the first matter is not meant a matter formally
different from the second matter, but accidentally only in respect of time: It
is called first, because it was first produced.

VII. It does not (as I hinted before) appertain to Physics to explain
abstractly what the first matter is, that being proper to Metaphysics:
Wherefore Arist. 8 Books of Phys. Auscult. deserve rather the name of
Metaphysics. That, which is requisite in this place, is to unfold the nature
of the first matter, as it is a Concrete to natural Substances, and contracted
to Inferiors. In Metaphysics it is treated of as a more universal, here as a
less: for Matter and Form constitute the Elements, as more Universals
constitute the lesser. Again, Matter and Form derive their Essence from the
Elements; for these being abolisht, they perish likewise with them. So that
without or beyond the Elements there is neither Matter, or Material Form.

VIII. The first Form of a natural being is the form of the Elements; how they
further constitute the matter and form of every body, shall be demonstrated as
we go on.

The Elements being produced all at once, and at the same time, it follows,
that there never was any Peripatetick first matter existent without a Form; for
their form and matter were both created together: but the alleging some
Principles of the Mosaic Philosophy, will soon make this case plain.

1. God created Heaven and Earth. But how? not separately or distinctly, at
several times, but united into one, and confused, at once, by one act of his
Almighty Power. Moses sets down Heaven and Earth disjunctly, not because they
were constituted as distinct bodies, but because Heaven and Earth were next
formed out of that confused matter, as the Text does afterward clearly explain.

We call one part of that body, which ascended, that is, expanded or moved from
the Center to the Circumference, heaven, because it was heaved up from the
other remaining part, which was named Earth, or as it were Tearth, from Terre
in French, which again is derived from Terra, a Terendo, quia Parts suo
pondere sese invicem terant. So Coelum a cernendo quod homines intuitu coelum
versus cernant. This rude Substance was hit upon, doubtless by guess, by the
ancient Poets, calling it Chaos, which although rude in regard to the more
express Form, which it was to receive afterward, yet it was a perfect being
consisting of Matter and Form, through which it had a positive Unity, whereby
it was one in it self, and distinct from nothing. It was a true being, in that
it was conformable to the Divine Idea. It was no less perfect, because God
created it. It was good, for it was convenient and apt to have other beings
produced out of it: So that having all the Attributes of a being, it must
necessarily be a perfect being, consisting of matter and form: if then the
first created being, out of which all other being were afterward created, was
a perfect being, where was then the materia prima of Aristotle? which is said
to be without any Form, and nothing but a pura potentia. You cannot reply, that
the Chaos was produced out of a Materia prima; for if I grant that, then
materia prima is a (non ens) nothing, because the Text mentions, that God
created Heaven and Earth out of nothing.

The Objection, which may be offered against us from Genesis 2. And the Earth was
without form, is not matterial: for by form here is meant an ulterior forma,
and not a Prima Forma.

IX. The F^^m, which did informate the Chaos, was that, whereby it was that,
which it was, namely, a Confusion of the Elements; This confused form, or forma
confusionis being expelled, there immediately succeeded a less confused, or
more distinct form, arising from a partial solution and separation of the
Elements: I term it distinct, because it was distinct from that first
confusion; and a more distinct form, because the Elements were yet more
separated, untied, loosened, and distinct. But as for a most distinct form,
whereby every Element should exist separately one from the other, and every
Element have a form of it self, whereby it is, that which now it is, namely,
Earth, a weighty, dense, and massy substance: Fire, a penetrable, rare, and
diffusive essence, etc. Before I sound into the depth of this Mystery, give me
leave to expose to your view the admirable manner of this divine Artifice.
First, God created a Chaos, or a confused mixture of the Elements, in like
manner to a Potter, who, having several sorts of Earth, mixes them all together
into one exact mixture, afterward he again diducts or draws its parts from
one another, and each part again after that he draws more and more from one
another, until at last it acquires that form, which he does ultimately intend
in it. So that the more he draws it asunder, the more complete form it
receives through each several and further Diduction: So God draws the Chaos
more and more asunder, and every drawing, diduction, expansion, or opening,
gives it another and a perfecter form. After the same manner is the production
of the Foetus in the Mothers Womb perfected: where there is first a Chaos or
exact Confusion of Genitures, then again its parts are more and more diducted,
which finisheth it with a perfect Form. I shall therefore delineate each part
of the Creation accomplished by Gods several and distinct (as to us) diduction,
which was performed by Gods Command upon an obediential Subject, of Let there
be. The effect resulting through virtue of this Command, was immediately
answered by, And it was so: The Perfection and excellency of it by, And God saw
that it was good.

There are two forms observable in the Elements: one absolute, which is, whence
the particular force, power, and virtue of each Element derives. This is
essential to every Element. There is also a respective form, which does
naturally derive from the first, and is, whereby every Element does essentially
incline to the other for its Existence and Conservation; for without each other
their absolute form could not subsist; which flows from their truth and
goodness. Neither did they ever exist singly, but were at the same time created
together. These two forms are really and essentially one: but modally distinct
from each other. What Finiteness, Unity, Durability, or Place are the Elements
capable of single? The earth through its Gravity would be incited to an
infinite motion, so would also fire, and consequently neither could possess any
place, or be of any duration: but the Earth and Water being occurred by Fire
and Air, their Gravities are balanced by the Lightness of these latter: and so
become withal to be terminated, and to be placed; but of this elsewhere.

CHAP. IV. Of the Nature and Essence of the Elements.
1. The nearest Definition of a Natural being. 2. The Definition of an Element.
That all Physical Definitions ought to be sensible. The proof of the Existence
of the Elements, and of their Number. 3. An Exposition of the Definition of an
Element. Its Etymology and Homonymy. 4. What Distinction the Author makes
between Principle, Cause, and Element. 5. What a Natural Cause is. That the
Elements are no single real beings. That they are treated of separately and
singly Ratione only. 6. That there are but three Natural Causes. Their
Necessity proved in Particular.


1. I Have hitherto given you the remote Definition of a natural being, and now
I state one somewhat nearer to our Senses, and such as is through it self
perceptible by sense.

A Natural being is an Essence constituted out and through the Elements: or
thus, A natural being is that, which is constituted out and by natural Causes:
but none are natural causes, but Elements only; wherefore the former Definition
being the nearer, and proved by the latter somewhat more remote;

We shall rather commend it, as being perceptible by sense; for none can deny,
but that the Elements are the sole natural causes: Show me by any of your
senses what natural being there existeth in the world, but what is Elementary.
Possibly this Definition may disrelish you, as being different from
Aristotle's. Let me tell you, that most part of the Perepatetick Definitions in
Physics are too remote from our senses, which causes a difficulty of
apprehending them, and proves a doubtful way for to lead us into Error.

II. An Element is an internal natural Cause out and through which a natural
being is essentially constituted. In Metaph. we have defined a natural being to
be internally consistent of Matter and Form, which are also called Natural
Causes in general, but remotely: because we cannot apprehend Matter and Form,
unless by a nearer thing representing both to our senses; as, through the
Elements we know what Matter and Form is: were it not that our sight persuaded
us, that a being was produced out of the Elements, we should be ignorant what
Matter were; and so the like of the Form. Here you may take notice of the
difference between a Metaphysical Definition, and a Physical one; the latter
being immediately perceptible through our Senses, and abstracted from
sensibles, the former being proper to reason and the mind, which does mediately
abstract its notions from these, according to that Trite Saying: Nihilest in
intellectu, quin prius fuerit in sensibus. the understanding knows nothing
but what it has first perceived by the senses. Now I will make clear to you,
that all natural beings do (proxime) immediately owe their essence to the four
Elements. Herbs spring forth, out, or from the Earth; but not, where there is
no Water: for there it proves sandy or barren, unfit to protrude any vegetable.

2. Although earth is sufficiently moistened by attenuated water, yet unless
the Sun can or does through its Beams cast a fire to it, or by the same fire
raise and excite that fire, which is latent in the earth, it remains
nevertheless barren. Lastly, Air is comprehended by water attenuated, that is,
Water and Air mixed together in such a proportion, that the tenuity of the air
may render the water attenuated and fluid, that so it may be apt to penetrate
through the depth of the Mixture; for otherwise water of it self is of that
thickness, that it exceeds Ice or Crystal. Now this Air incrassated, or Water
attenuated does open and expand the density of the earth, makes way for the
fire to enter, and at last retains the whole mixture in a coherence and
compactness. Of this more hereafter.

Again, A body consists of the same Principles or Elements into which it is
dissolveable; but all natural bodies are dissolveable into the first Elements:
therefore all bodies consist of the said first Elements. I shall only instance
in some few examples for proof of the Minor. Milk in its dissolution is changed
into Curds, which through their weight go down to the bottom, and are analogal
to earth. 2. Into Butter, which contains in it incrassated ayir and fire, for
it is also inflammable, a sign of fire. Lastly, Into Whey, which is responding
to attenuated water. The like is observable in Blood, dividing it self into
Melancholy, expressing earth in its weight, color, and Substance; for drying
it, it becomes perfect Sand: into Choler, agreeing with fire in its motive and
alterative qualities: into pure blood, through its gluing quality or lentor,
not unlike to incrassated air: Lastly, into Phlegm or Phlegm, resembling water.
Does not the ordinary division of man's body in spirits (impetum facientes)
humors and solid parts, demonstrate its composition or constitution out of the
Elements? For the Spirits are nothing else but fire and air, Humors contain
most water, and the solid parts most earth. The Spagyrick Art proves the same
by distillation, through which water, Spirits and Oil (the two latter being
made up most of Fire and Air) are separated from the Caput mortuum, Sal fixum,
or earth and Subsidencies. It Is true Sal, Sulphur and Mercurius are different
Names, but re ipsa are the Elements: What is Sal but Earth? Sulphur but fire
and air? Mercurius but water? Hereby I have not only proved the existence of
elements, but also their Number nominatim atque in specie.

III. Give me leave to expound the Definition in the first place quantum ad
nomen.

In the word Element is considerable its Etymology, from (...), capio: quod
element a in sese omnia capiunt mixta.

Its name is likewise homonymous, in a large sense promiscuously
(convertibiliter) denoting a Principle, or Cause. In a strict sense, it is
differing from both. Eudemus, Alexander, and Thomas Arist. Met. b. 6. c. 1.
Text. 1.
Aq. opiniate, that through Principle (Principium) is only meant an agent
cause: through Cause, a formal, and final Cause: through elements, Matter.
Averrhoes and Albert. by Principles intend an efficient cause: through Causes,
final Causes: by elements Matter, and Form. Generally Principles are understood
to be of a larger extent then Causes, and Causes then elements: So that
Aristotle B. 5. of Metaph. Chapter 1. describes a Principle to be that, from whence
a thing is, is made, or is known: by this you see, that a principle is of a
more large signification then either of the others: but a cause is, which
contributeth to the being of a thing, either by substituting it self for a
Subject, as the Matter: or through actuating and giving it an essence, and its
consequence, as the Form: or by determining it to an end, as the final cause.

IV. The distinction, which I have made between them, is, that cause is of a
larger extent, then Principles are taken in Physics (but in Theology a
Principle is larger then it) these denoting the internal causes of a natural
being, as matter and form, but remotely, as I have already hinted: Elements
point out to sensible and immediate internal causes of a natural being.

V. A natural cause is, which has a virtue of acting naturally, or which
acts according to that power which God has conferred upon it at its first
Creation: So that Van Helmont says well in his Physic. Arist. Did. 3. Ego
vero credo, naturam jussum Dei, quo res est id quod est, and agit quod agere
jussa est. But I believe, that Nature is Gods Command, through which a thing is
that, which it is, and acts that which it is commanded to act. They are
Causes, to wit, internal causes or principles of a being, because they
contribute themselves to the constitution of that being. I said out of which,
because they are the matter of all natural beings: and through which, because
they are also the Form of all the said beings. How they are or become so, you
may expect to read below. The elements are described and taken singly or
separately, ratione only, or ex supposito, and not realiter: for they never did
exist singly (neither could they exist so, supposing they were created in that
nature, in which they were, because of their relative forms) but confusedly in
the Chaos. Aristotle names the bodies constituted by those mixed bodies, as if
they were different from naturals: but that was only to make good the first
part of his Metaphysical Physics, and thereby to distinguish them from the
others, namely his proper and elementary Physics.

VI. Three causes do concur to the production of a natural being, whereof two
are internal, to wit, natural matter and form; the other is external, namely,
the Efficient. I prove the necessity of these three: first there must be a
Subject or Matter, out of which a being is produced: for (ex nihilo nihil fit)
out of nothing nothing can be produced. But I instance in some particulars; the
good wives know, that for to make a Pudding, they need Matter (namely Flower,
Eggs, etc.) to make it out of; or to build a House, a Mason will require Stones
for his Matter, etc. Now when they have these materials, they endeavor to make
something of them, that is, to introduce a new thing, shape or face into it, or
educe a new thing out of it (which locution is more proper then the, former, it
being the efficient does ex intrinseco quasi formam educere) and what is that
but the Form? And lastly, Experience tells us, that (quod nihil fit a seipso)
nothing is produced from it self, but from another, which is the Efficient: as
in the building of a house, you may have stones and Mortar for your matter, yet
unless a Mason (who is the Efficient) place them together, and introduce or
rather educe the form of a House, the matter will abide matter.

I. I Thought fit to make a stop in my Discourse, and before I proceed any
further, to propose the Opinions of others concerning the first Principles,
Elements, and Constitution of natural Bodies. Baptista van Helmont
impropriating the knowledge of true Philosophy and Physic to himself alone,
calls Hippocrates, Galen, Aristotle, and all other wise men Fools, and terms
their Dictates figments; but withal propounds new foundations of Philosophy and
Physic, threatening a great danger to those, who did obstinately adhere to
their Tenants, and promising an infinite treasure to such, as should receive
his. Wherefore I shall first contractly relate his Philosophic Principles;
then examine them. Fol. 33. of his Ort. Med. Did. 3. He reproves the heathens
for falsely teaching the Number of Elements to be four: as also for asserting
three Principles, to wit, Matter, Form and Privation. All things (says he) are
idle, empty, and dead, and therefore stand only in need of a vital and seminal
Principle, which besides life, have also an order in them. He denies the four
Genders of Causes, the first matter, the causality of a form, receiving it for
an effect alone. Further he states only two causes, namely Matter, and her
internal Agent, Efficient, or Archeus. In the same place he terms Matter a
co-agent, not a subject, which, he says, was improperly attributed to her by
Philosophers. And in Did. 21. he denies the congress of the four Elements,
yea not of two of them, to concur to the constitution of mixed bodies. His two
Causes or Principles, he calls bodies in one place, in another (as you may read
below) he detracts it from the latter. The first of the said Principles is
called ex quo, out of which, the latter, per quod, through which. Did. 23. he
concludes water to be a beginning out of which (initium ex quo) and the Ferment
to be the seminal beginning through which, that is, Disposing, whence the Semen
(Seed) is immediately produced in the matter, which it having acquired,
becomes through it life, or the media materia (the middle matter) of that
being, extending to the period of the thing it self, or to the last matter.
Did. 24. The Ferment is a created formal being, which is neither a Substance
or Accident: but neither, in the manner of light, fire, magnal, forms, etc.
created from the beginning of the world, in the places of their Monarchy, for
to prepare and excite the semina (seeds) and to precede them. I consider the
ferments to be truly and actually existing, and to be individually distinguished
through Species (kinds.) Wherefore the ferments are Gifts and Roots established
from the Lord the Creator to all ages, being sufficient and durable through
their continual propagation, that they might raise and make seeds proper to
themselves out of the water, to wit, wherein he gave the earth a virtue of
germinating, he gave it as many ferments, as there are expectations of fruits,
Wherefore the ferments produce their own seeds, and not others. That is, each
according to its Nature and Properties: as the Poet says; For nature is
underneath the earth. Neither does all ground bring forth all things: For in
all places there is a certain order placed from God, a certain manner and
unchangeable root of producing some determinate effects, or fruits, not only of
Vegetables, but also of Minerals and Insects. For the bottomes of the earth,
and its Properties differ, and that for some cause, which is connatural and
coeval to that earth. This I do attribute namely to the formal ferment, that is
created therein. Whence consequently several fruits bud forth, and break out of
themselves in several places: whose seeds we see being carried over to other
places, come forth more weakly, like to an undercast child. That which I have
said concerning the ferment cast into the earth, the same you shall also find
in the Air and the Water. The difference, which there is between the ferment
and efficient, is, that the former is the remote Principle of Generation, and
produces the latter, which is the semen, which is the immediate active
Principle of a thing. Here you have a Synopsis of his Philosophy, which in the
progress throughout his Book, he repeats ad nauseam usque.

II. When I first took a view of the Title of his Volume, which was, The Rise
of Medicine, that is, The unheard of Beginnings of Physic. A new Progress of
Medicine to a long Life for the revenge of Diseases, by the Author John
Babtista van Helmont, Governor in Merode, Royenlorch, Oorschot, Pellines, etc.
He might be Governor of himself in those places, but not of, etc. I wonder
what those places signified, since the people of Brussel admired upon what his
Heir lives. This old man in his lifetime was strangely melancholy, and by
Fits transported into Phanatick Ecstasies; questionless had he been of a
Religious House, he would much have added by help of these Raptures, to the
incredible Bulk of the Golden Legends; but his Demon turned them to Physic:
He had a great Design in Christening his Son, Mercurius, to have made another
Trismegistus of him: and not unlikely, for wherever he is, he is all-knowing. I
was much abused by the Title of his Tract, hoping to have found a new sound
Archologia; and lighting upon ignorance of Terms, abuse of words, but a most
exact Orthography, limiting almost every second word with a Comma, or a stop,
as being measured by his as^matick breathing. The Fame, which he deserved from
his Countrey-folkes, was equal to a famous Mountebank: The Churchyard was the
surer Register of his Patients: His Arrogance and Boastings were Symptoms of
his depravate conceptions: His Cruelty fell it last upon his own bowels,
through which he lost his Life for the neglect of very ordinary means. This is
the account I had at Brussels of his Life and Transactions, which I thought was
not unworthy of my insertion in this place, thereby to disadvise some from a
rash belief to his vain words, that so they might avoid the same Dangers and
Cruelties upon their own and other men's Lives.

III. But in reference to his Dictates: He rejects the number of four Elements,
without proposing any Argument for Confutation. He denies the existence of a
first matter, also without giving proof for the contrary. Both which we have
already demonstrated. The form is an effect (says he) and not a cause: this
argues his misseapprehension of a cause and effect: for most Authors agree,
that a cause (in a large sense) is, whatever produces an effect; now the form
produces an effect, in giving a specification to the whole. It seems he
intends nothing for a cause, unless it be really distinct from its effect
(which in a strict and proper sense may be allowed) but if granted,
nevertheless he is in an Error, for asserting Matter and the Archeus to be
causes; neither of which are really distinct from the being constituted by
them. Further, it is no reason, that, because the form is an effect, therefore
it can be no cause; for all beings in respect to their own production are
effects, and yet are causes of the constitution of others. All things (says
he) are idle, empty and dead, without a vital principle: Judge his absurdity:
What are all idle, empty and dead things without a life, but a materia prima
Aristotelica? For he himself affirms, that there are but two principles, Matter
and a vital Principle: yea those very words idle, empty and dead, square with
these of Arist. Materia prima est nec quid, nec quale, nec quantum. He allots
only two causes, Matter, and her internal efficient to the generation of a
being. First, as I have proved, it is impossible for this internal efficient to
be reduced in actum, unless an extrinsick efficient, be it the Sun, or some
other particular efficient, excite it by contributing some of its own virtue to
it. Secondly, Would not all Philosophers deride him for saying an intrinsic
efficient? since that all have consented to term an efficient extrinsick, in
contradistinction to intrinsic or internal, which is ever a part of the being
constituted by it, whereas an efficient is named extrinsick, because it does
not constitute a part of that being, to whose production it was concurring.
Thirdly, Wherein is his Archeus or internal efficient different from a form,
which he does so much detest? Is not this Archeus an effect also of its
preceding cause? Does he not affirm, that this internal efficient gives life
to its matter, and what is a form, but which gives life or a being,
distinction, and specification to its matter?

Here again he says, that Matter is a Co-agent, and before he stated, that she
was idle and dead, certainly idle and dead things do not use to act, or to be
agents, or co-agents. That matter is not a subject he asserts, and before and
afterward he granted, that she contained the Archeus; What is a subject, but
that which does contain a thing? Here again he adds a Note of distinction to
his Archeus, which is to be per quod, and is not this also an inseparable
Attribute of a Form?

Did. 23. Here again he delivers a new Foolosophy, in stating water to be the
sole material Principle (although below he adjoynes earth to it) the ferment to
be the remote efficient, and the semen to be the immediate efficient: so then,
now there are three Principles, yea four; Water, Earth, and a double Archeus;
whereas before there were but two. Besides here he vaunts out with a threefold
matter, a materia prima, which is a co-agent with the fermentum, or first
Archeus, a materia media, a subject of the semen, or second Archeus, and a
materia ultima, quickened through life it self. So now he is got beyond the
number of the Peripateticks; three distinct matters, and three internal
efficients, make up just six Principles. Surely the old man was climed up into
one of his Raptures. Well let us go on in making disquisition upon the 24 h.
Did. The Ferment is a created formal being: Just now there were no forms, and
now the ferment or the prime Archeus is metamorphosed into a form: Where was
his Memory? It is not a Substance or Accident (says he) but neither, in the
manner of Light, Fire, etc. How? neither a Substance or Accident, neither
Spirit or Body: neither quid, quale, or quantum: Ergo it is nothing, but a
merum figmentum. If it be in the manner of light, or fire, it is in the manner
of a quality, or substance. Now I think, I may let him run on in telling out
his Tale.

IV. Cartesius, a great Proficient in the Mathematics, labored much to reduce
all Philosophical conclusions to demonstrations, depending from certain
Hypotheses; but wherein they excelled the ordinary, or Peripatetick ones,
either in truth, certainty, or evidence, I have hitherto not yet learned. If
they may be comprehended within the limits of Demonstrations, they must be a
posteriori, concluding only the (...) of things, or their effects by improper
and affinged Causes: so that the causes remaining still under a cloud, we
cannot be satisfied in any such Science. It Is true, did those forementioned
suppositions appear to us as Phenomenon (appearances) like unto others in
Astronomy, there might thence some ground be afforded, but they being mera
figmenta and entiae rationis, must necessarily prove very sandy for to build
real truths thereon. Neither do his suppositions cohere in all places, he
admitting many supposita non supponenda, yea contradicentia, to their number.

Besides to frame, think, or imagine, that God (like unto a Potter, turning his
Wheel round with a staff, and grinding the Clay thereon into many pieces,
figures and whirles) should grind the materia prima into several pieces,
whirles, figures and shapes, is no small absurdity, especially when Scripture
does so positively teach us the contrary. Would a man's mind be carried forth to
such Chimaera's, furer and evidenter Principles might be proposed by the means
of Numbers. But tell me what satisfaction can any one expect, from such
Conclusions, as long as their Premises are not granted, but thought figments
and falsities? For it is not the effects we enquire into, but into their real
and adequate causes. Does he make any thing more plain, or does he thereby
escape all falsities? Certainly no; for many of those Assertions that are
thence deduced, do manifestly partake of falsities and Errors; as,

1. That the nature of a body does not consist in weight, hardness, color, or
the like, but alone in extension.

2. He speaks a word or two only of rarefaction and condensation, and so away:
I conceive the rest did surpass his Mathematical demonstrations.

3. That a corporeal substance, when it is distinguished from its quantity, is
confusedly conceived, as if it were incorporeal.

4. He disproves a vacuum by an idem per idem, thus; there is no vacuum,
because the extension of all bodies is equal to their internal and external
places. The question is the same still; viz. Whether all external places are
filled up with extensions of internal places of bodies?

5. He denies real Atoms.

6. That motion taken properly, is only to be referred to the contiguous bodies
of that, which is moved; neither is it to be referred, but to those contiguous
bodies, which seem to lie still. A fundamental error.

7. That matter is infinite, or divisible into infinite parts.

8. That the world is of an indefinite quantity.

9. That the second matter of Heaven and Earth is one and the same.

10. That all matter is really single, and obtains its diversity of Forms
from local motion.

11. That in one body innumerable motions are possible.

12. That the Moon and the other Planets borrow their Light from the Sun.

13. That the Earth is in nothing different from a Planet, and consequently
that the other Planets are inhabitable.

14. That the Moon is illuminated by the Earth.

15. He assumes most of the erroneous Opinions of Copernicus.

16. That all the parts of the earth are light.

17. That Water is convertible into Air. Neither are his Definitions (if he
has set down any) of the Elements, as of Fire, Air, Water, or Earth, plainer
then Aristotle has explained them: His Demonstrations are altogether remote
from sense: Besides the confusedness of his method. In fine, I cannot imagine
what practick use may be made of them. As for these Particulars which I have
here cited against him, I shall prove their falsities in the progress of my
following Discourse.

CHAP. VI. Of the Material Principle of Natural Beings.
1. The Causes of the Elements. 2. That the Elements are really compounded
natural beings. 3. That Matter and Quantity are really identificated. 4. What
Quantity is. What its Ratio formalis is. 5. That in rebus quantis there is a
maximum and a minimum Definitum. 6. Experimental Instances proving that there
are actual Minima's, and that all natural beings do consist out of them. 7. The
pursuit of the preceding Instances inferring a Continuum to be constituted out
of actual Indivisibles. Some Geometrical Objections Answered.


SOmewhat has been heretofore stated, touching the matter and form of Natural
bodies, which being remote, we must descend lower, and add a few notes
respecting the matter and form of the Elements. Wherefore remember;

I. That the elements are natural beings, and therefore consist of natural
matter and form, and are constituted from an Efficient.

II. The Elements arising from the conjunction of matter and form, are not to
be counted single bodies in that respect, nor in any other, but as much
compounded, as any other body derived from them: that is in this Phrase:
Elementa sunt majora composita, ac caetera ab ipsis orta entia, quanquam haec
illis censenda sunt magis composita: So that it was an error in Aristotle to
define an element by a single body, or being. They could not be thought to be
single in any other respect, but in their real separate existences; but such
they never had any That is, entirely separated existences.
, their relative form contradicting it.

III. It is a property in matter to be an internal cause, which through its
quantity is capable of receiving a form: So the elements were affected with a
quantity, through which they received their forms. I do here strive as much as
may be, to reserve that old custom of terms and phrases in Physics, which
Aristotle has assigned to us; but again reflecting upon the abuse and
improperness of them, I am compelled to call to mind a Rule of my Metaphysics;
to wit, that the essence of all things are but modes united: and for that
reason, counting quantity a mode, I cannot make any thing else of matter, but a
mode, (I mean matter in a concrete sense) for what is matter really, but
quantity it self, they differing only ratione? and how that? Thus; Quantity is
only notional, or a term assinged by the understanding to a res quanta, for to
explain that a thing is made out of it; and yet that whereout the thing is made
is quantity still. So form is nothing else but a notion, whereby we express the
activity and quality of a thing, and beyond that activity and quality it is
nothing: Wherefore observe, Quantity and Quality being the two essential,
principal, and eminent modes of a natural being, and fit terms and notions,
they are usually treated of distinctly in this part of Philos. under the name
of matter and form. Now do not take either of them separately for a Substance,
unless they be both joined together. You may also remember, that Quantity is
the only Accident allowed to matter by the Peripateticks, but this quantity not
being possible to exist through it self, others did confer a forma quantitativa
upon matter: for a forma they imagined it needed, because through it quantity
was distinguished from nothing; now that which makes a distinction is the form
only. Besides, what is quantity without form? Even nothing, because without a
form it is not that which it is, as further appears by the definition of a
form. Since then we have proved, that matter is primarily nothing else but
quantity, we shall easily make it appear, that it cannot exist without the
other modes, as place, duration, etc.

IV. Quantity is a mode of a being, through which it is extended, that is,
through which it has one part existing beyond the other: or thus, Quantity is
the Mole, Magnitude, or Dimension of a being. That which does immediately
follow this magnitude, is the extension of parts, and that which does follow
this extension, is internal and external place, and habit, etc. I say, these
affections follow one another, not really, for they are existent all at once;
but intentionally only, because the one does represent it self to the
understanding before the other. Now, when the dispute is about the Ratio
formalis of quantity, whether it be divisibility, mensurability, mole,
magnitude, extension of parts, etc. it is to be understood, which of them does
primarily represent it self to the mind, not which of them is re prius; for
they are really co-existent, and identificated. In Answer to the Question thus
stated, I hold, that the extension of one part beyond the other, or its
repletion and possession of place, is the potissima ratio quantitatis. That
which we do first conceive through the perception of a res quanta, is, its
repletion of place, or extension of one part beyond the other: for at the first
sight of a body, we judge it to be a body, because it appears to us to have
one part extended beyond the other, or to possess a place; this is presently
after confirmed to us, because it seems to be a bulk, mole, magnitude, or to be
divisible, and by that we conclude, it is no Spirit, or nothing, and (as I said
before) because it does replenish that place, and is commensurated by it. As
for extension of parts one beyond the other, it is the same with the repletion
of an internal place: which that it has, we come to know through its repletion
of an external place. Take quantity concret^ for a res quanta, or res extensa
sive locata, mensurata, divisibilis; it matters not which, as long as we agree
inre, although differing in nomine.

V. In Quantity or rather rebus quantis, or in materialibus, there is a minimum
definitum, and a maximum definitum. Wherefore all beings must be one of those,
or interjacent between them: for that, which is less then minimum, is nothing;
that which is more then maximum is infinitum; neither of which is natural.
Fire, we see, if it be less, then it can abide in its least quantity, it goes
out, and becomes nothing. So whatever is less then a Sand of earth, or the
least drop of water is nothing of the said Species. That which is actu greater
then the world, is infinite; neither is there any thing bigger (quantitate
materials) then it; ergo there is a maximum. Further, were there not a minimum,
or a maximum, there must be an infinitum actuale granted, which the finiteness
of all things in the world persuades us to deny. All grant quantity to have a
terminus a quo and ad quem; and what can these termini be else, but a minimo ad
maximum? If otherwise a thing be supposed ultra minimum and maximum, it is
ultra terminum, and indeterminatum, or infinitum. All quantitative beings are
dissolveable into their minimum quod non, as we may observe in distillations,
where water is dissolved into its least vaporous drops, beyond which it
vanishes; and in sublimations, where the subtillest and finest points of earth
are carried up to the capitellum in the least parts, that nature can undergo.
Fire ascending Pyramidally, first disperseth it self into its least points,
after which, into nothing. The Air is divided into its least parts, That is,
beyond its points it is nothing.
as it is seated within the Pores of bodies. All these Instances imply parts
divided into minima actualia, realia and physica: so that they are not minima
potentialia, or Negationes, as Peripateticks and Nominalists do obstinately
obtrude.

VI. Well then, let us pursue these Instances: Water being dispersed into its
least parts in the head of a Limbeck, they come to unite again into one body;
which is a manifest Argument, that a continuum is composed out of indivisibles
alone (for minima's are indivisibles, otherwise they could not be minima) in
this following manner. When the whole head of a Still, or only part of it, is
so thick and close beset with vaporous points, that they come to touch one
another, then they do unite into a continuum, and make up a body of water. The
same is observed in subliming earth into its indivisible points, which sticking
to the Capitellum of the sublimatory, do no sooner return into a Clot of earth,
then these sands come to touch one another. Is not a Line also made through
union of points in the same manner? as appears in this Example, take a round
Ball and cast it upon a plane, it first touches the Plane upon a point, and
bending further to the plain, it makes another point close to the first, and so
on many more; all which together, describe a Line upon the said plane. Numbers
are notional Characters of real beings, but they do likewise contain a minimum,
to wit, one; ergo also those real beings whereunto they are applied. Is not
time composed out of instants united, and motion out of (ex impetibus) spurts
joined to one another? That there are instants and spurts, the Operations of
Angels do confirm to us. Divide a Line into two parts by another Line, the
divided Line is divided in its least part; where again the divided particles
joined to the dividing Line is also in their least points, or indivisibles,
which three points must necessarily make up a continuum: the reason is this,
because that, which through its being taken away, does take away the
continuity, must also constitute that same continuity by its re-addition.
Lastly, Grind any matter upon a Porphir into an Alcool, which if you grind
longer, you shall sooner grind it into clods and bigger pieces then lesser; the
reason is, because nature is irritated by the violence and heat of grinding, to
call the Air to its Assistance, which glueth its body again together. I could
add many other Experiments confirming the same; but to avoid prol^xity, I
shall omit their Insertion.

We may then without danger of any further cavil, state, that Indivisibles are
actually contained in their whole, since the whole is both constituted out of
them, and dissolved into them at its dissolution.

2. That there is a minimum and maximum in all natural bodies, whether animated
or inanimated. I cannot but strange at the stupidness of Authors, who object
certain Propositions of Euclid against this kind of Doctrine, as,

1. That of 1 El. 1 Prop. Where he teaches, that upon every right line given
there may be an equilateral Triangle described: Whence they infer, that all
lines are divisible into equal parts; if so, then it contradicts the aforesaid
Positions: For (say they) suppose a line consisted of three points, it could
not be divided but in unequal points, or parts: it cannot be divided into a
point and an half, because a point according to this Definition is indivisible.

2. Euclid demonstrates in the 6 B. p. 10. that a line, be it never so little,
is divisible in as many parts of the same proportion, as the greatest line may
be. Now then supposing a line consisting of three points, and another
consisting of ten, or more, the former line is divisible into three parts only,
the other in many more.

Granting the truth of these Propositions, it concludes nothing against us; for
these prove against the composition of a Mathematical line out of Mathematical
points, which we all know to be infinite, and in a continuum drowning each
other, they cannot make up its length; but these are only notional, and
therefore we may not thence deduct any certain Rule appliable to the natura
rerum: for if we should, why might we not likewise infer thence, that the world
being a continuum, consists of infinite parts, and that its duration is
eternal, because that being a continuum, must in the same manner consist of
infinite parts: or thus, we might infer, that the numbers framed by man being
infinite, all things, upon and for which they were imposed, are also infinite:
but this does not hold in naturalibus, although in conceptibus. It is certain,
that man can and does conceit millions of Notions, especially in the
Mathematics, which never have been, or shall be (to wit, in that same manner)
in nature. Our case at present is concerning Physical points, such as have a
determinate Longitude, Latitude, and Profundity, but the least. The
forementioned Propositions are related to Continuities, as they contain
indivisibilities potentia; but these are contained actu in theirs. The points,
which we treat of have a Magnitude and Mole, which although minima, yet apposed
one to the other, constitute majora, and being augmented to the greatest
number, produce a maximum. They remain divisible Mathematice, but naturaliter
indivisible. Here may be objected, if these minima are quanta, they are also
divisible. I Answer, That they are divisible quoad nos, but indivisible quoad
naturam: or as I said before, they are divisible Mathematice, not naturaliter.
We conceive them to be divisible, because they appear mensurable although with
the least measure, they are mensurable because they are located, they are
located because they have Magnitude.

CHAP. VII. Of the Natural Matter and Form of the Elements.
1. That the Elements are constituted out of minima's. That they were at first
created a maximum divisible into minima's. 2. That, supposing there were a
materia prima Aristotelica, yet it is absurd to assert her to have a Potentia
Essentialis, or Appetitus Formae. 3. That the Natural Form is not educed e
Potentia materiae. 4. That the Actus of Local Motion is the Form of the
Elements. 5. The manner of knowing the first constitution of the Elements. That
there was a Chaos. 6. That there was conferred a distinct form upon every
Element. Whether a Form is a Substance. It Is proved that it is not.


I. ANd now give me leave to apply what has been stated in the preceding
Chapter to the Elements, which as they are constituted out of Indivisibles,
Points, or minima's, so they are dissolveable into the said Indivisibles. At
their first Creation they were each created a Maximum. Their matter is nothing
else but their concrete quantity, mole, or magnitude. Neither are we to
imagine, that God did create all the minima's of the world, before he united
them to one Mass, but created the whole Mass at once, divisible into
indivisibilities, that so they being divided into indivisibilities might become
a fit matter for mixture; and therein he imposed an order and law upon the
Elements of generation and dissolution: and without this Law, what Order is
there imaginable?

II. Supposing these points coagmented into one Mass, were created before the
advent of a form (which is impossible secundum quid) and being without any
determination, figure, motion, or any thing, that descends from a form, it
would be nothing differing from Aristotle's materia prima: Now then I demand
what Potentia essemialis, or Appetitus formae could there be rationally
conceived to inhere in her? Certainly no essential one, but obediential;
neither an Appetite to a form, for she being blind, how could she perceive a
form, to covet it? or being destitute of motion, how could she have an
appetite? since Appetite is nothing else but a natural motion, or inclination.

III. Matter having brought quantity, place, habit, and duration along with
her, let us further enquire what company the form has attending it. A form, as
we said before, is little else but a Mode of activity and quality: For quantity
without her is nothing of her self; it is the same that does constitute her,
and adds distinction and action to her. That, which gives activity and
quality to Matter and Quantity is an actus of Local Motion. This actus of
motion is not raised out of quantity or matter, for then it would remain
quantity, neither is it educed out of the disposition of matter; for even so it
could be nothing yet but matter disposed. Wherefore it is a strange saying to
assert, that the form is educed out of the power of matter: Either this may be
taken properly, and then it is equipollent, as if you said, the form is educed
out of the matter, as she is potent, that is, as having a disposition or
propension unto; and this is impossible: or improperly, when the power of
matter is taken for a being, which as yet is not, but may be; neither can the
form in this sense be educed; for she then would be educed e nihilo, or e
privatione.

IV. That the actus continuus of local motion is the form of the Elements: I
prove it. That, which is the first cause of all the effects acted by the
Elements, must needs be their form: but such is the act of local motion.
Wherefore, etc. I shall omit the proving of the Minor here in general, since I
have proved it below in particular.

V. The particular production of each part of the world holds forth the manner
of the production of the whole, since they are all derived from one universal
efficient, Nature Naturating. We observe then daily; as for instance, in the
production of Man, Beasts, Fowls, Minerals; that these draw their first
Original from a confusion of Principles of Elements, which is an assured note,
or mark that the Elements of the universe were first cast into a confusion
(quia pars totius naturam aemulatur.)

2. It is no less undoubtable, that as the activity and qualities of these
fore-instanced formations were latent, and contained in their confused
Elements, and gradually extracted, inacted, and exalted to their ((...))
perfection, through the virtue of an efficient, in like manner were the
activity, and qualities, or forms of the elements latent in their Chaos, and
afterward gradually extracted, expanded, divided and exalted into their
fullness by the same Nature.

3. It is hence apparent, that the Elements underwent several changes, but
total, not partial ones, and therefore require a particular disquisition upon
each.

VI. Let us imagine many millions upon millions of minima's of quantity, or
matter divided into four equal parts, whereof each is set apart to be the
matter and subject of every one of the four Elements. Each of these, it is
necessary should be vivified and actuated by a distinct form, for otherwise
they could not in their dissolution from the Chaos, prove apt substances for
the constitution of distinct bodies. Or simply, a form is needful, or how, or
by what power could they act? But the question will be, whether this form is
not an incomplete Substance, as the Philosopher states. The question, me
thinks, is rather, whether it is not a Bull to name a substance incomplete? For
a substance is a substance because it is complete, and its completion or
perfection gives it a subsistence: so that were a form a substance it might
subsist per se: Besides, would it not according to Aristotle make an unum per
Accidens, or could it be directly referred to a Predicament, were it united to
another real substance? Neither is it sufficient to distinguish it from an
Accident, because it does constitute part of the compositum: for so does every
other accident or mode, as appears in Metaphysics: Does it not inhere in
Subjecto per modum accidentis, or can it exist out of it? And wherein is it
then different from an Accident?

2. It is frustraneous for the form to be a substance, since that a being
through its quantity only is capable of receiving quality, and activity or
virtue of acting That is, an actual virtue, or continuated act.
.

A form then is a power of acting in a substance, but not a substance; it is
essential to a being, but modally only distinguished from it, not really; for an
activity in a substance is nothing else, but an active substance.

The concomitants of this activity, or form are many, as alterative qualities,
color, figure, and all determination and distinction: In a word, it renders
its subject hoc aliquid.

Although the form is not educed e potentia materiae, it hinders not from being
educed e potestate actuali Agentis, vel efficientis, as Scaliger delivers.

CHAP. VIII. Of the Absolute and Respective Form of Earth, Water, Air, and Fire.
1. What Form it is the Author allots to Earth. That dryness is not the first
quality of earth. 2. The respective form of Earth. 3. That Coldness is not the
first quality of Water. That water is not moist naturally, neither does it
moysten: What it is to moysten. Why water acuated with Spirits of Vitriol,
Sulphur, or of Saltpeter, does moysten and abate thirst more then when it is
single. 4. The form of water. What Gravity is, and what Levity. What Density
is. The form of water proved. Why water disperseth it self into Drops. Why
Seamen cannot make Land upon the Cap-head, when they may upon the Top
Mast-head. Why the Stars do appear sooner to those in the East-Seas, then to
others in the West. 5. That water is thick but not dense. Whence it is that
water is smooth. Why Air makes a Bubble upon the water, when it breaks forth.
That the least Atoms of Air cannot break through the water without raising a
Bubble. Why the same does not happen to Earth, 6. That Moisture is not the
first quality of Air, neither does the Air naturally moysten any body, but to
the contrary dries it. 7. The form of Air. What Tenuity is. Why Feathers,
Cobwebs, and other light Bodies do expand themselves when thrown through the
Air. Why Grease, Oil, Wax. etc. do make Splatches when poured upon the ground.
Why Gunpowder, Smoke, Breathes of living creatures, Vapors, Exhalations, Dust,
etc. do diffuse themselves in that manner. Whence it is that the least breath
moves and shakes the Air. The relative form of Air. Why Spirits of Wine mix
easier and sooner with water, then one water with another. 8. The first quality
of fire. What Rarity is. Whence it is that a Torch or Candle spreads its Beams
circularly, as appears at a distance. That Fire is roof: the cause of it.
Fire's Relative nature. A comparing of all the first qualities of the Elements
one to the other.


1. THe Form lately mentioned may justly be surnamed (...), Perfection; because
it confers a Perfection upon matter. But to return where I left: After
sufficient evidence, that each of the Elements are actuated by a distinct form;
I begin first with the Earth, whose form and first quality is weight (pondus)
with density.

1. Because through it, it performs all its Operations and Effects.

2. The form, or first quality of a body is unremoveable; but dense weight is
unremoveable from earth; ergo it is its form, and first quality; whereas
dryness, which is brought in competition with it by all Peripateticks, is
removeable; for earth may be moystened with water. This is an Herculean
Argument, if well weighed.

3. A Privation cannot be the first quality of earth, because it is accidental
to it; but dryness is only a privation of moisture, and consequently
accidental. I confirm the Minor; had there never been any moisture, who could
ever have thought of dryness? Again, in the ordinary Ideom of speech, we say,
such a thing is dry, because we feel no dampness in it: for first we feel, and
gather it together to try whether we can feel any moisture; but perceiving no
moisture, or dampness, we say it is dry: Ergo, because of the privation of
moisture. Further, moisture and dryness are privative opposites, because the
one being removed, the other also vanishes: For take away sight, and you take
away blindness; it being improper to say a thing is blind, unless in opposition
to sight. The same is appliable to dryness and moisture; take away moisture,
and then it will be improper to say dryness.

Lastly, the Peripatetick description of dryness proves no less: Dryness is,
whose subject is easily contained within its own bounds, but difficultly within
another. Now unless there were water, within whose bounds it could not be
contained, there could be no dryness, since that dryness is, whose subject
cannot be contained unless difficultly within the bounds of water; or Air
either.

II. All elements and each of them are actuated by a respective, or relative
form, that is, their being and conservation consists in a relation of a
dependence from each other; for instance, the earth is inconsistent of it self;
for through its incomprehensible gravity it would move to an infinitum, which
is repugnant to its truth; so that through its pondus it inclines to the fire;
which again through its lightness bends to it; and so meeting one another,
they embrace and constitute each other in their being. Well may Authors term
their close and entire union a discors amicitia, or amica discordia, since
their motion to each other is so fierce, and eager, that it does as it were
appear a fighting, or discord, but it tending to so mutual a good and benefit,
proves the greatest friendship. But should coldness and heat be stated to be
the form or first qualities of the Elements, they could not subsist one moment,
because they are the greatest contraries, and therefore would not cease from
their most incenst hostility; before each were expelled from their common
subject; as we see plainly in water and fire.

III. This makes way to free water from coldness, to which it is neither but a
privation of heat: For suppose there were a dish of water placed without the
sphere of the elements, it would be improper to say, it were either hot or cold.

Neither is Moisture the first quality of water; for water of it self (per se)
does not moysten any thing absolutely, that is freed from all mixture. I prove
it: To moysten, is nothing else but to be thinly covered, or dashed over with
water, or its vapors; but water, when it is in its absolute state, is of so
thick parts, that it is unapt to adhere to any thing. We observe that
Quicksilver (or rather quick Lead, for so it is in effect) and melted Lead,
although liquid, yet they do not moysten, because their parts are thick. By
thickness I do not intend a depth of quantity, or of matter only, but such a
depth of quantity that is not porous, or a crassitude, whose parts are diducted
and drawn out into a continuity, and that throughout all its dimensions, and
therefore through defect of tenuity does not adhere to whatever is immerst in
it: even so it is with water, which supposed in its absolute, or separated
state does by far exceed quick-Lead in thickness, and consequently is unapt for
humectation: but in the state wherein it now is, which is mixed and attenuated
with much fire and air, it does easily adhere to whatever body, that is dipped in
it. This is the reason, why water in hot Countries does sooner quench thirst,
then in cold; or wine sooner then water; because the watery parts are more
subtilized by the indivisibilities of fire, that are dispersed through them.
Now water abates drought but little, because of its crassitude. Experience tells
us, that one little measure of water acuated with Spirits of Vitriol, of
Sulphur, or of Saltpeter does moysten the body, and abate thirst in a Fever
more then a Pint of water single, because the water is subtilized by the
forementioned Ingredients. But Physicians vulgarly adscribe this effect to the
penetrability of the admixtures; A blind reason: because water does penetrate
to the internals, therefore it moystens the more; this is not all; for suppose
that water did penetrate, yet it would not moysten, because it does not adhere
to the parts, which it does touch; wherefore it is only to be imputed to its
subtilization. All which demonstrates, that water in its purity, that is, in
its absolute state, does moysten less then Quicksilver, which is not at all.

IV. The Form or first quality of water is gravity with crassitude. There is no
single word I can think upon in any Language, that I know, full enough to
express what I do here intend, and therefore am compelled to substitute these.
I explain them thus: You must apprehend that gravity is a motion from the
Circumference to the Center. Levity is a diffusion or motion from the Center to
the Circumference. Now there is a gravity with density, that is, which has
density accompanying it. Density is a closeness of minima's not diducted into a
continuity, but potentialiter, (that is Logice) porous, and such is proper to
earth.

There is also a gravity with crassitude; which is a weight, whose parts are
diducted into a continuity, or I might rather express my self, whose parts do
concentrate, or move from the Circumference to the Center with a continuity,
that is, without any potential pores dividing its matter; as in Quicksilver,
diduct its body to the Circumference as much as you can, yet its part will
concentrate with a continuity: but if you diduct earth, you will perceive its
porosity, so that its body is altogether discontinuated. Water is then weighty
with a crassitude.

I prove it. First, that it is weighty, or that its parts move from the
Circumference to the Center: Water when divided through force does unite it
self in globosity, as appears in drops, where all its parts, falling from the
circumference close to their center, form a globosity.

2. Water does not only in its divided parts concentrate, but also in its whole
quantity. This is evident to them that are at sea, and approaching to the Land,
they first make it from the top-mast-head; whereas standing at the foot of it
upon the Deck they cannot. The reason is, because the water being swelled up in
a round figure, the top is interposed between the sight of those, that stand
upon the Deck, and the Landmarks, as hills, or steeples; but they, that are
aloft, viz. upon the Yard arm, or topmast, may easily discover them, because
they stand higher then the top of the swelling of the water. The same is also
remarkable in a Bowl filled up with water to the Brim, where you may discern
the water to be elevated in the middle, and proportionably descending to the
Brim to constitute a round Figure. Archimedes does most excellently infer the
same by demonstration; but since the alleging of it would protract time, and
try your patience, I do omit it.

Lastly, The Stars rising and going down do plainly demonstrate the roundness
of the water; for to those that sail in the Eastern Seas, the Stars do appear
sooner then to others in the Western Ocean; because the swelling of the water
hinders the light of the Stars rising in the East, from illuminating those in
the West. The same Argument does withal persuade us, that the earth is round,
and consequently that its parts do all fall from the Outside to the Center.

V. Secondly, That water has a crassitude joining to its gravity, sight does
declare to us; for it is impossible to discern any porosity in water, although
dropped in a magnifying Glass; which in Sand is not. Its levor or most exact
smoothness expressing its continuity, and accompanying its weight, is an
undoubted mark of its crassitude, whereas roughness is always a consequent of
contiguity and porosity. There is not the least or subtilest spark of fire or
air can pass the substance of water, unless it first break the water, and so
make its way to get through; this is the reason, why the least portion of air,
when enclosed within the Intrailes of water, cannot get out, unless it first
raises a bubble upon the water, which being broke, it procures its vent. Nor
the least Atome of fire cannot transpire through water, unless it disrupts the
water by a bubble, as we see happens, when water seeths: or disperse the water
into vapors, and carry vapors and all with it. But air and fire do easily go
through earth, because its parts being only contiguous and porous, have no
obstacle to obstruct them: for sand, we see, in furnaces will suffer the
greatest heat, or fire to pass through, without any disturbance of its parts.
Lastly, Its respectiveness or relation does require this form, both for its own
conservation, and for others: For the earths relative form being to meet and
take hold through its weight and porosity, (this porosity is necessary for
admitting the fire within its bowels; for were it continuous, as water is, it
would expel fire, and dead it) of the fire, and by ballancing its lightness to
preserve their beings mutually, it needs the assistance of water, for to
enclose the fire, when it is received by the earth, and through its continuity
to keep it in, otherwise it would soon break through its pores and desert it.
So that you see, that water by doing the earth this courtesy, preserves her
self; for were she not stayed likewise in her motion through the fire and air,
she would move to an infinitum.

VI. Moisture is not the first quality or form of the air. I prove it. Moisture
(as I said before) is nothing else, but the adhesion of a moist body to
another, which it does affect, or touch. Now, in this moist body there must be
a certain proportion (or Ratio substantiae) of quantity; it must neither be too
thick, or too thin. Water therefore in its purity is unapt to moysten, because
it is too thick; so air in its absolute state is too thin to adhere to any
body, that it reaches unto. If air in its mixed nature, through which it is
rendered of a far thicker consistence, is nevertheless not yet thick enough to
adhere to the sides of another substance, much less in its purity. Who ever
has really perceived the moisture of Air? I daily hear people say, hang such a
thing up to dry in the air; but yet I never heard any say, hang it up in the
air to moysten, but wet it in the water. This drying Faculty of the air
Peripateticks assert to be accidental to it, namely through the permixtion of
exhalations with the air. Alas, this is like to one of their Evasions: Do we
not know, that the air in its lowest region is rather accidentally moist,
because of its imbibition of vapors, copiously ascending with the fire or
heat, tending out of the water to its element? Is not the heat more apt to
conveigh vapors, that do so narrowly enclose it, then earth, which of it self
permits free egress to fire? yea where an Ounce of Exhalations ascends, there
arises a Pint of Vapors. Waving this, I state the case concerning the second
Region of the Air, or of the top of Mountains, where according to their own
judgment, neither Vapors, or ^xhalations are so much dispersed, as to be
capable of drying or moystning any ex rinsick body; even here do wet things dry
quicker then below, because the air here is much freed from that irrigation of
waterish moisture, which the vapors contribute to the lowermost Region, as
impelling all extraneous vapors and exhal^tion to a body. Moreover, I will
give you a reason for it. To dry is to dissipate and disperse moisture or
dampishness adhering to any substance; but the air being a most subtle body,
does through its subtility attenuate the water, which attenuated falls off from
that body, whereunto it first hung, and is then imbibed by the air, which it
does afterward detrude to its proper place. Lightness with tenuity is the form
and first quality of air. What lightness is, I have set down before. Tenuity is
a continuous exparsion and diffusion into all dimensions. As water is weighty
with crassitude, so contrariwise (as it were) is air light with tenuity. I
prove that air is light, because all aerial bodies, as Cobwebs, Feathers,
although they are complicated, yet being cast forth into the air, their parts
are diffused from the Center to the Circumference.

Grease, Tallow, Oil, Wax, etc. these bodies, because they do much participate
of Air, when melted, and dropped upon the ground, do spread themselves into broad
splatches, not contracting themselves like earth or water, into close round
bodies, but rather contrariwise. Gunpowder, when kindled, Smoke, breathes of
living Creatures, Vapors, Exhalations, Dust, etc. are all diducted from their
Center to the Circumference, through the natural motion of the air enclosed
within their bodies. The Air, if condensed (as they say, but improperly) is in
a counter-natural state; for then it makes use of violence; ergo its diffusion
to the Circumference is natural to it. That the air is tenuous, or confisting
of thin parts expanded in continuity into all dimensions, its rupture does
signify; for were it contiguous, every subtle, exhalation, or wind would not
move it, but might easily transpire through its porosity without concussing it;
but it being continuous, is compelled to break; which rupture causes both its
commotion, and sound. Hence it is that the least breath moves the air, and
makes a sound in it. The reason why the water is moved, or at any time a sound
is made in it, is, because it being continuous, is subject to ruptures, which
disposes it to both; but neither happens to fire or earth, because they are
porous, and only contiguous. Lastly, Its being and preservation is impossible
without this relative form: For through it the Air does moderate, balance, and
is subservient to it self and other Elements. Water is weighty with crassitude,
and through its so being, it compasses the earth so narrowly, that the fire is
unable of striking through its continuity for to meet the earth; wherefore Air
being light with tenuity does diffuse and expand the body of water, and so the
fire is led to the earth by the conduct of the Air. Again, water being of that
weight would move to an infinitum, and the lightness of fire is insufficient to
stay it, because water is heavy and thick (and therefore contrary to fire,
which is light and rare) and through that quality must necessarily expel the
fire; wherefore air is requisite for to balance its weight, and having partly
the same nature with water, and partly different (yet not contrary) is alone
capable of mixing with the water. Air is partly of the same nature with water,
because they are both continuous, and so do thereby immediately at their first
conjunction pervade each other, and come to an exact union. This I will
illustrate to you by an Example. Affuse Spirits of Wine to Water, you see they
will mix exactly in a moment; for you may presently after taste them equally at
the bottom of the Glass, and at the top. Now, it is evident, that Spirits of
Wine are very ayry and fiery, and therefore, because continuous, mingle
instantly with the water. But fire refuses to mix with it, because it is
contiguous and light, and altogether contrary as it were. It is different,
because it moves to the Circumference, and water to the Center; Pray observe
the wisdom of Nature: this is most necessity; for although they are both
continuous, how could they mix unless the one did move to the Center, and the
other from it, whereby they come to meet one another in an instant? Did they
move both to the Center, they could not mix or meet together; for being then
supposed to be of an equal weight, that, which was undermost, would remain
undermost; much in the manner of two Horses going both one pace, one before the
other, about in a Mill, who will hardly meet, unless the one turns its gate,
and go contrarily to the other, and so they do immediately confront one
another. Hence it is that wine mixes quicker by far with water, then one kind
of water does with another. By this you may discern the absolute necessity of
these motions in the Elements, both for mixtion, and their mutual conservation.

VIII. The first quality of fire is Levity with Rarity. Rarity is a subtility,
or minority of parts, whereby its minima's are contiguous one to the other. Who
ever doubted of the lightness of fire; Does not fire diffuse its heat equally
from its Center to the Circumference? Does not the fire in a Torch cast its
light circularly from its Center? That fire abhors a continuity, we perceive by
its burning; for we see that the flames in Spirits of Wine do terminate into
points, which points make a roughness, whereas were the fire continuous, its
terms would be smooth, like unto those of Water and Air. Does not the fire work
through the smallest pores? ergo through its contiguous points. Hence it is
that fire passes, where air is shut out. Its relative nature is constituted by
its contiguity of parts; for through it, it is fitted for the embracing of
earth; were it continuous and light, it would shun the earth; or if admitted
into the earth, the earth would disrupt and expel it, like as it disrupts and
expels Air. Wherefore through its porosity and contiguity it enters the earth,
and the earth enters it, each opening its pores at this friendly reception:
Nevertheless, supposing that contiguity had no contrariety to continuity, yet
would the Air not be light enough to sustain the weight of the body of earth;
besides, there must be two gravities conceived for one lightness, and two or
three continuities for one contiguity; so that of absolute necessity a fourth
Element must be added, that might be answering to the earths gravity and
density, through its levity and rarity. That, which is light and rare, is more
vibrating, and by far of greater activity and energy, then that, which is light
and thin. Summarily, let us take a view of all their first qualities, and
compare them together. Water and Air do communicate in a perfect friendship,
and so does Earth and Fire; water and earth, air and water, fire and air, are
all beholding to one another, yet not in the same respect, but diverse. Water
and Fire at an immediate contact are absolutely disagreeing, but mediately
accompanying other Elements, prove good friends; the same Law is between Earth
and Air. Observe, although I have explained their forms by more words then one,
yet apprehend that in their sense they move a single concept. Levity with
Rarity is really distinct from Levity with Tenuity; their operations, and
manner of operating being also different; for Levity with Rarity is more
penetrating, vibrating, and of a stronger force; and therefore Fire exceeds the
Air in Levity. The like is to be understood of the Earth and Water: to wit,
that the former is more weighty then the latter. These concur equally to the
constitution of one another, of the world, and of its parts; the one
contributeth as much as the other, and therefore they are of an equal dignity,
and time.

THus much shall suffice concerning the Matter and Form of the Elements, as
they are considered supposedly separated from each other; but notwithstanding
are the Particulars last insisted upon really in them primatio and per se. Now
let us proceed. Since these Elements are perfections, and as it were forms to
each other, the one being constituted, does suppose them all to be constituted;
and but one of them being abolisht, they are all abolisht: Wherefore it is a
simple question to demand, which of the Elements we could best miss, or which
of them is most necessary for the preservation of life, they being all of an
equal necessity?

I. The first formation of the world took its Original from the creation of a
Chaos: which that it did, has been demonstrated in one of the precedent
Chapters.

The Chaos is a great and vast natural body, consisting of an exact mixture of
all the four Elements: It is generally explained to be a Confusion of all the
Elements. Hereby confusion is not meant an Hence (...) from (...) fundo, sive
consundo.
imperfect mixtion; but it is called a confusion, because it is an universal
mixtion of all the Elements. The Chaos was a natural body, because it was
constituted by the natural Matter and Form of all the Elements. That it had
matter is little doubted of by any, all derived natural substances being
thereout materiated. But a form is not so universally allowed to it; Moses
telling us in the first Chapt. of Genesis That the Earth was without form. For the
reconciling of this, you must know, that a form is not always taken in the
same sense. A Form is sometimes taken for the complete and last perfection of a
thing; so we say, that the confusion of genitures in matrico is rude and has
no form, that is, it has not that complete, further, and last perfection and
shape, which is intended in it.

2ly. Form is more commonly taken for that, which gives specification and
distinction to Matter, or that, whereby a thing is that, which it is; so as in
this acception the Chaos of the Microcosmus is termed not to be without a form,
neither is the Chaos of the Macrocosmus void of form; although in the former
sense it is.

I prove it. The Chaos was either a thing, or nothing. It was not nothing, for
the Text mentions it consisted of Heaven and Earth. Was it a thing? ergo it
must have had a form to be that thing, which it was, or to be distinguished from
nothing. It was not only distinguished from nothing, but also from an infinitum,
and from a single essence, it consisting of Heaven and Earth, which constituted
both a finitum and a compositum: But all distinction derives from a form; ergo
it ha^ form.

Further, the Scripture does reveal to us, that the Spirit of God moved upon
the face of the waters, and what was the Spirit of God here, but the form of
the Chaos? Again, the Spirit of God moving upon the waters does evidently
confirm my former Assertion, namely, that the form of the Elements is nothing
else, but a local moving virtue impressed by Nature, that is, God, upon their
Matter.

II. That the whole Clot of each Element contributed to the Matter and Form of
this first created body, the same Scripture makes clear to us in enumerating
them distinctly, viz. Chap. 1. 1. In the beginning God created Heaven and
Earth. And the Earth was without form, and void, and darkness was upon the face
of the deep; and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. First,
you see here is Heaven, comprehending fire and air; for as I proved before, air
cannot exist without fire, nor fire without air. Secondly, Both these being
near companions and relations, the Text comprehends them in one: for if you
observe, the Scripture does all along in this Chapter enumerate the Elements by
paires (as it were) under one name, because of their near affinity: So by the
deep is meant Earth and Water (strictly or properly so called) and by waters
the two fluid Elements, which are those, that before are explained to be
continuous Elements. That this is the genuine Interpretation of the said divine
Text, the ensuing words do clearly make it out; for in v. 6. God says, Let
there be a Firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters
from the waters: Here the water and air being both alike in fluidity, and
confused together, are both called water: The air then being light, and the
water weighty, God expanding them, the air through its lightness heaved up from
the water, and thence constituted a part of Heaven, as the Text has it in v.
8. The water through its weight descended under the air, and thence it is
called in v. 9. the waters under the heaven. This must necessarily be so; for
water, strictly so named, had it been heaved up, it would have been against its
first nature, and been moved violently, which is improbable, since that (nullum
violentum est perpetuum) no violent motion is lasting. The nature of air
certifieth us, that it must be it, which moved above the waters under it.
Lastly, The waters above the waters, strictly so termed, are called the
Firmament; from its firmness; because they are as a deep frame, or a strong
wall about the waters underneath, for to keep them together in a counterpoise,
from falling to an insinitum: but it is ai^ that is above the waters, and is a
Firmament to them; ergo the air must be comprehended under the Notion of
waters. Or thus (...) in the Hebrew is by the Rabbi's and Hebrews expounded, an
Expansion, or thing expanded: for its Root is (...) to attenuate: if so, then
by the waters above must be implied air, whose nature it is to be expanded, as
I showed before. So whether you take the word according to the interpretation
of the Septuagints (...), Firmament, or of the Rabbi's, Expansion, there can be
nothing else intended by it but air. I say then, as by waters, a duplicity of
Elements is implied, so by the Heavens, air and fire are implied: I prove it:
Light is fire flaming; but the light was drawn from the Chaos; if from the
Chaos, ergo not from the earth; for by earth there is only meant earth single;
but from the Heaven, which imports a conjunction of Elements, viz. of Air and
Fire. Secondly, Is light, being a flaming fire, drawn from the Heaven; ergo
there was fire, latent in it: So let this serve to answer Van Helmont his
Objection, who denies fire to be an Element, because its name is not set down
in the first Chap. of Genesis neither is air mentioned among the Elements in so
many Letters, yet it is comprehended among them. It Is true, Fowl are called
Fowl of the air, but what of that? this does not infer that air is an Element,
because Fowl are named Fowl of the Air.

Secondly, Earth and Water are there expressed in so many letters, ergo the
Chaos was made up of all the four Elements.

III. The Elements in the Chaos underwent an exact mixture; because each being
a stem and perfection to the other, they required it: for had they been
unequally mixed, then that part which had not been sufficiently counterpoysed by
its opposite Element, would have fallen from the whole. Hence it follows,
that they must have been of an equal extent and degree in their first virtue or
quality, and not only so, but also in their quantity; that is, they consisted
all of an equal number of minima's, that so each minimum of every Element might
be fitted, sustained, and perfectionated by three single minimum's of each of
the other Elements. Now was there but one minimum of any of the Elements in
excess above the other, it would overbalance the whole Chaos, and so make a
discord, which is not to be conceived. But here may be objected, That the earth
in comparison with the heavens, bears little more proportion to their
circumference, then a point. I confess that the air and fire exceed the earth
and water in many degrees, but again, as will be apparent below, there is never
a Star which you see, yea and many more then you see, but contains a great
proportion of earth and water in its body, the immense (to our thinking) Region
of the air and fire are furnished with no small proportion of water and earth:
so that numeratis numerandis, the earth and water are not wanting of a minimum
less then are contained either in the fire or air.

IV. The efficient of this greatest and universal body, is the greatest and
universal cause, the Almighty God. I prove it. The action, through which this
vast mole was produced, is infinite; for that action, which takes its
procession ab infinito ad terminum finitum, sive a non ente ad ens, from an
infinite to a finite term, or from nothing to something, is to be counted
infinite; but an infinite action requires an infinite agent; therefore none
but God, who is in all respects infinite, is to be acknowledged the sole cause,
and agent of this great and miracuious effect.

It was a Golden saying upon this matter of Chrysippus the Stoic, If there is
any thing, that does effect that, which man although he is endued with a reason
cannot: that certainly is, greater, mightier, and wiser then man; but he cannot
make the Heavens: Wherefore, that which does make them, excels man in Art,
Counsel, and Prudence. And what says Hermes in his Pimand? The Maker made the
universal world through his Word, and not with his Hands. Anaxagoras concluded
the divine mind to be the distinguisher of the universe. It was the Saying of
Orpheus, That there was but one born through himself, and that all other things
were created by him. And Sophocles, There is but one true God, who made Heaven
and the large earth. Aristotle, Lib. 2. De Genesis and Cor. c. 10. f. 59. asserts.
God to be the Creator of this Universe. And Lib. 12. Metaph. c. 8. He attests
God to be the First Cause of all other Causes.

This action is in the holy texts called Creation, Genesis 1. 1. Mark 10. 6. Psalm.
89. 12. Mal. 2. 10. Creation, (...), is not always intended for one and the
same signification; sometimes it implying the Creation of the world, as in the
Scriptures next forementioned; other whiles it is restricted to Mankind, Mark
16. 15. Mat. 28. 19. Luke 24. 47. In other places it is applied to all created
beings, Mark 13. 19. Genesis 14. 22. Job 38. 8. Prove. 20. 12.

(...) To create is imported by diverse other Expressions.

1. By (...) To Form, Genesis 2. 7. Esaias. 43. 7. 2. By (...) To make, Genesis 1. 31.
3. (...) He has established, Psalm. 89. 12. Psalm. 104. 5. Mat. 13. 35. Heb. 6.
1. 1 Pet. 1. 20. 4. (...) To stretch or expand, Psalm. 10. 2. Es. 42. 5. 5.
(...) To prepare, or dispose, Prove. 8. 27. Psalm. 74. 16.
V. Creation is a production of a being out of, and from nothing. Tho. gives us
this Definition in Sent. 2. Did. 1. Quest. 1. Art. 2. Creation is an emanation
of an universal Being out of nothing. By an universal being, he intends a
being, as it comprehends all material and immaterial beings. So that this is
rather a definition of the creation of the material and immaterial world, then
a definition of the Formality of Creation. 2. His Definition is defective and
erroneous; for he adds only out of nothing. This is not enough, it being
possible for a thing to emanate out of nothing, and yet not be created: the
immaterial operations of Angels and rational Souls emanate out of nothing,
because they do not emanate out of matter, and yet they are not created, but
naturally produced. It Is true, although they emanate out of nothing, yet they
emanate from something, to wit, from their immaterial Essence: and therefore
they are not to be judged to be created. It is also possible for a thing to be
created from nothing (anihilo sui) and yet out of something; so are all beings
created that are created by a mediate creation. Wherefore my Definition has an
immediate creation to its definitum. Now if you would define creation, as it
does in a large extent comprehend also a mediate creation, it is only to
substitute in the room of, and from nothing, or from nothing: thus creation is
a production of a being out of, or from nothing, or from and out of neither.

Austin, Lib. 11. de Civitate Dei, c. 21. commends a threefold Observation upon
the Creation.

1. Who is the Efficient of it; and that is God.

2. Whereby, or through what he proceeded to Creation; through that he said,
Let there be; and all things were.

3. For what reason, because he is good.

We read something not unlike to this in Diog. Laert. Lib. 7. The Stoics
(says he) state two Principles of things, an Agent, and a Patient. Through an
Agent they understood Matter; and through a Patient, the Word of God, which did
adorn that Matter.

That God is the Author of the Creation, besides the reason foregiven, the
Testimonies of the Sacred Bible, of holy men, and of Philosophers, do confirm
it to us.

Psalm. 102. 25. and 147. 9. Mal. 2. 10. Es. 45. 6, 7. Job 9. 8. Jer. 10. 12.
and 51. 15. Job 26. 13. John 1. 3. Col. 1. 16. Romans 13. 36. Rev. 4. 11. Heb. 1.
2.

That creation is the production of a being out and from nothing, the Scripture
does also reveal to us. Genesis 1. Prove. 8. 24. Psalm. 33. 9. John 1. 3. Romans 4.
17. Heb. 11. 3.

Austin Lib. 1. De Genesis contra Manich. Although all things are formed out of
that unform matter, notwithstanding is this same matter made out of nothing.

Lactan. Lib. 2. Cap. 9. Let none ask out of what matter God made so great and
wonderful works; for he has made all things out of nothing. Neither are we to
give hearing to Poets, who say, that there was a Chaos in the beginning, that
is, a confusion of things, and of the Elements, and that afterward God did
divide all that Mass, and having separated every thing from the confused heap,
and described them in order, he did build the world, and also adorn it. It Is
more credible, that matter was rather created by God, which God can do all
things, then that the world was not made by God, because without a mind,
reason, counsel, nothing can be made. Here our Author reasons against the
Eternity of the Chaos, as the Poets feigned to themselves: whose Song was, That
the Chaos being an immense, rude, and void mole, did fluctuate without any form
from all eternity, and that God in time did confer a form and shape upon it,
and brought it to what it is. Yet nevertheless he states a finite Chaos under
the name of matter, created by God out of nothing.

Hemingins teaches us, That creation is the primar production or formation of
things, whereby God the Eternal Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, together with
the Holy Spirit did produce and form Heaven and Earth, and the things therein
contained, both visible and invisible, out of nothing, to the end that he might
be acknowledged and worshipped.

Hermes Trismegistus, Lib. 1. Pimandr. That ancient (...), declares himself
(seemingly) more by inspired words then acquired ones. The mind (says he) of
the Divine power did in the beginning change his shape, and suddenly disclosed
all things, and I saw all things changed into a light, most unspeakably sweet
and pleasant. And in another place, Sermon. 3. Pimandr. The infinite shadow was
in the deep: and the water and thin spirit were in the Chaos: and the holy
splendour did flourish, which did deduct the Elements from under the sand, and
moist nature, and the weighty lay drowned in darkness under the moist Sand.

The same divine Mercurius, Lib. de Piet. and Phil. renders himself thus;
(...). The first is God; the second the world; the third man: the world for
man: and man for God.

Another Philosopher speaks with no less Zeal and Eloquence. (...). It is an
old saying, and revealed by the ancients unto all men, that all things were
constituted out of God, and through God: and that no nature can be enough
accomplished to salvation, were it committed to its own tuition without Gods
help.

Thales being sometimes demanded, what of all things was the most beautiful? he
answered, the World; for it is the work of God, which nothing can exceed in
beauty.

Plato in Tim. attested Gods Love to be the cause of the making of the world,
and of the rise of all beings.

Clemens Alex. said, that the Creation of the world was Gods Handwriting,
whose Leaves were three: Heaven, Earth, and the Sea.

VII. The Genus of the Definition is Production; which is either supernatural
or natural. A supernatural Production is called Creation: A Natural one is
termed Generation. Observe that supernatural and natural are remote differences
of Creation and Generation; wherefore I did not appose the foremost of them to
our Definition, because I substituted its differentia proxima.

Whether Production, by others called Efficiency, is an emanant or transient
action, is controversial. Thomas, as you have read, terms it an emanation. On
the other side, why should it not be conceived to be a transient action, since
it does terminare ad extra? But then again why so? For all transient actions do
presuppose the pre-existence of their Object, which here was not. Wherefore to
avoid all scruples, I conclude it (if actively understood) to be apprehended
per modum actus emanantis; if passively, per modum actus transeuntis.

Creation is either so called strictly, and then it imports only an immediate
creation, according to which sense you have it already defined: or largely, and
then it is divisible into immediate or mediate Creation.

An immediate Creation is the same with Creation in a strict sense, whereby a
being is produced out of nothing; neither out of a pre-existent, or co-existent
matter: but a nihilo termini, i. e. formae, vel materiae: sive e nihilo
privativo, vel e nihilo negativo. Wherefore I say, that this immediate Creation
is no mutation, because mutation presupposes pre-existent matter. But it may
be you will side with Dun^, who for to maintain it to be a mutation, did
impiously assert the thing, which was to be created, (res creanda) to have had
its essence pre-existent in the divine mind: so that creation must be the
mutation of an Essence not existing, into an Essence existing.

In the first place, Scripture does plainly contradict him.

2. He did mistake the nature of Essence and Existence, as further apppears out
of my Metaphysics.

3. It infers an absurd Definition of Creation, to wit, that it is the mutation
of a being a non esse accidentali ad esse accidentale, and consequently an
accident only is produced de novo, and not a Substance.

4. That the essences of things are eternal; a great absurdity. I grant they
are from all eternity, that is, from an eternal being.

5. Did God contain the essences of things in himself, it follows, that he
also contained their matter in himself; a great Blasphemy.

A mediate Creation is the production of a being a nihilo termini, vel formae,
sed ex aliquo materiae: a nihilo formae, supple ultima. This kind of Creation
is expressed by two different words. (...), and (...) or making, is whereby God
created a being ex aliquo materiae, sed a nihilo formae ulterioris. In this
sense did God create the Fishes and Fowl. (...), or an artificial formation is,
whereby God formed man also a nihilo formae ulterioris.

Mediate Creation differs from Generation, through that thereby a form is
introduced in an instant: hereby successively by a preceding alteration.

2. Thereby a being is constituted a nihilo formae ulterioris: hereby ab aliquo
formae ultimae, tanquam a termino a quo. That is effected by the immediate
causality of God, this by a mediate one.

VIII. The Chaos being so equally mixed and balanced abided in one place. The
place, which did contain it, was not corporeal; because it would have been
needless, since its own balance did sufficiently preserve it in its own
internal place.

Its magnitude was equal to the present magnitude of the world: For although
through its expansion and opening, the fire and ayt were heaved up, yet they
were heaved up no further then the weighty Elements descended: so that what
space was left by the one, was taken up by the other: but had there been a
vacuum left by any of their egressions, then indeed it must have possessed a
larger place.

As for the tangible quality which it had, it must needs have been soft;
because it being temperated ad pondus, could acquire no other then a temperate
one, and such is soft.

Color it had none ex accidenti; because there was no light to discern it:
nevertheless that does not hinder but that it had a fundamental color in it
self; which must have been red, that being the only color issuing out of a
temperamentum ad pondus.

Taste is also detracted from it ex accidenti, but in it self it must have been
sweet for the same reason.

We cannot edscribe any smell to it per se; because being close shut, or not
yet opened, none can grant that it could have affected any supposed smell,
since it could not have emitted any Exhalations from it.

That it had a finite time, Scripture testifies, Genesis 1. 1. In the beginning,
etc. but the beginning is a distinction, and Note of finite time; Ergo. Reason
proves no less. That which was finite in all its other modes, could not be
capable of one single infinite mode: But such was the Chaos, and such is the
world now; Ergo.

Whose parts are subject to a beginning and ending, its whole must also have
been subject to the same: But our daily experience confirms to us, that all
things are subjected to a beginning and ending; Ergo.

Its figure is round we know from the form of the Elements. Besides rotundity
is a figure of the greatest, equallest, and perfectest extension; but such is
most suitable to the greatest, equallest, and perfectest body; Ergo.

The Chaos was also finite in its globosity and extent of parts. I prove it.
The completed world being finite in its globosity and extent of parts, does
necessarily infer the finiteness of the Chaos in the same particular; because
the completed world was framed out of it. Now that the world is terminated in
magnitude, the circumvolutation of the Aplane and the Planets in a finite time,
to wit, in 24 hours, does certainly demonstrate; for were the world infinite in
magnitude, they must then also require an infinite time to roll round about it;
the contrary of which is doubted by none.

Here that trite Axiom may be objected qualis causa, taelis effectus. Such as
the cause is, such also is its Effect: But God is an infinite cause; ergo his
effect, namely the world must also be infinite.

I answer, That this Maxim holds only in univocis, and naturalibus, but not in
their opposites.

2. It is a Character of Gods infiniteness, that he can act finitely and
infinitely; for could he act only infinitely, then might he be supposed to act
necessarily, which is a note of finiteness and limitation in a cause.

3. The action, whereby he effected this finite work, is infinite, as I have
observed before, wherefore in this he acts both finitely and infinitely.

And since I am about answering Objections, it will not be amiss to insert some
objected by Bodinus, in Theatr. Not. and Cajetan, against the pre-existence of
the Chaos before the completed world.

1. Eccles. 18. 1. Where God is said to have created all things at once; Ergo
there was no pre-existent Chaos.

I answer, that Creation here does imply an immediate creation, through which
God created the matter of all things at once.

2. They resume the words of Austin, asserting, that to God there is nothing
before or after another, no past or future time, but that all things are like
as it were in one moment, filling that, which has a most perfect being.
Wherefore say they, Moses did distinguish the Creation into several sections
and divisions, to accomodate things created in an instant, to our capacity.

I answer, That had Moses writ, that God had created all things in a moment, we
could have understood him as plainly as he has writ otherwise; for we know
that Scripture contains many harder sayings then this would have been. So that
it is a great levity in them to retort the genuine sense of sacred words to
their oblique brow. As for that of Austin, it hinders not, but that all things
past, present, and future, are as in an instant to God, and yet to us may be
past, present, and future.

The Chaos is not only finite in duration and continuated quantity, but also in
discrete (as they term it) quantity or number. Its quantity is the least and
the greatest: it is the least in discrete quantity; for there was but one
Chaos. 2. But the greatest in continued quantity. The proof of these depends
reciprocally from one another. The Chaos is but one, because it is the
greatest; were there then more then one Chaos, but two, three or more, or
infinite, it could not be the greatest, but part of the greatest, and so the
whole must be greater then the part: on the other side, it is the greatest,
because it is but one.

2. Were there more then one, all the others would be created in vain, because
the Chaos being the greatest, is sufficient to produce a thousand worlds; for
otherwise it could not be said to be the greatest.

3. Or thus in other terms: The Chaos is an universal quantity; but were there
more then one, it could not be universal,

4. Unity is the beginning and root of all plurality: but the Chaos is the
beginning and root of all plurality of bodies; ergo it is but one.

5. The Scripture mentions but of one Chaos, Genesis 1. 1, 2.

6. The Chaos is eval naturally, like as the soul of man is eval, and also
immortal. Eval, that is, of sempiternal duration, yet counting from a
beginning. I prove it. Eccles. 12. Let the dust return to its earth, and the
spirit return to God who gave it. Here the body first returns to dust, thence
to earth, but not to an annihilation; for then the Scripture would have
mentioned it. Eccles. 1. 4.

2. The Chaos is to remain, were it but to retribute the matter of humane
bodies, in order to their Resurrection.

3. Annihilation is the greatest defect or imperfection; for it supposes an
imperfect Matter and Form, which cannot be imagined to be immediately created
by God. 4. Goodness lasts for ever; but the Chaos was good, Genesis 1. 31. 1 Timothy 4. 4. Ergo.

5. Should the Chaos be annihilated, then God would have created it in vain:
But that is impossible; Ergo.

CHAP. X. Of the first Division of the Chaos.
1. Why the Chaos was broken. 2. That the Chaos could never have wrought its
own change through it self. The Efficient of its mutation. 3. The several
Changes, which the Chaos underwent through its disruption. The manner of the
said Disruption. 4. How Light was first produced out of the Chaos. What a Flame
is. 5. A perfect Description of the first knock or division of the Chaos. By
what means the Earth got to the Center, and how the Waters, Air, and Fire got
above it. Why a Squib turns into so many whirles in the Air. 6. The
Qualifications of the first Light of the Creation. A plain demonstration
proving the circular motion of the Heavens, or of the Element of Fire to be
natural, and of an Eval Duration.


I. IT was an Elegant Expression of Clem. Alex. Lib. 3. De Recogn. Like the
shell of an Egg, although it seems to be beautifully made, and diligently
formed, nevertheless it is necessary, that it should be broken and opened, that
the Chicken may thence come forth, and that that may appear, for which the
shape of the whole Egg seems to be formed: Wherefore it is also necessary,
that the state of this world do pass, that so the more sublime state of the
Heavenly Kingdom may appear in its brightness: The same I may aptly apply to
the Chaos, that it is to be broken and opened, that so a more glorious
substance may thence appear, and come forth.

II. One Substance can have but one first power or virtue of acting; and
therefore the Chaos having no more, could not act any effect, but which it did
act, and so had no principle of changing it self from that which it was, and
consequently would have remained in that shape for ever. For this reason we
must grant, that the Creative power and universal efficient wrought a mutation
upon it. This mutation was gradual a perfecto ad perfectius. It was not by way
of a (...), or creation of the first manner, but of a (...), or as Moses sets
down, through that he said, fiat, let there be; and this was the Note of the
mediate Creation. The manner, as we may best conceive to our selves, was by
expansion, division, or opening of the Chaos.

III. Through the first diduction and opening, the Fire and Air being light
Elements, and so entirely knitted into one, must necessarily have diffused
themselves above the superficial weighty Elements, these falling nearer to the
Center. The fire having hereby acquired a greater liberty, and more force, by
being less oppressed by the water, its contiguous parts were notwithstanding
united and suppressed through the continuity of the air, and conveyed a great
part of earth and water with them; the air also could not be detracted from the
universal mixture without the adherence of some water and earth; wherefore that
appeared also very thick.

IV. The fire being the lightest, and of most activity toward the
Circumference, must have been vented in the greatest quantity, yet not (as I
said) without incraffated air, which united to the vibrating parts of the fire,
were both changed into a flame: A Flame is a splendent heat (Flamma est calidum
splendens;) wherefore by this two new qualities were produced, to wit, heat and
splendour. By (Calidum) heat, understand a red hot fire. (Ignis candens;) Fire
is named candent, quod candorem efficiat, because it begets a candor, that
is, the brightest light. But how fire became at once through this division
burning and candent, I shall distinctly evidence hereafter.

The Representation of the Chaos after its first Division.


V. Through this concussion the waters being also somewhat freed from the
minima's of the earth, tending to the Center, were continuated a top of the
earth, like unto a fleece or skin;, for the points of the earth, which did
before discontinue the water being through their more potent gravity descended,
the water getting a top, must needs have acquired its continuity, which (as you
have read ^^fore) is the first quality of water. The water therefore got above
the earth, not because it is less weighty per se, but per accidens, through its
continuation.

The flame of the first division was yet thick and reddy, not exalted to that
brightness, which afterward it was.

The heat of this division was hot in the first degree, because there was not
yet so much fire drawn out as to make a greater heat.

This flame I may compare to the flame of a torch or candle, which is either
but newly lighted, or near upon going out; the heats, which these flames then
cast forth, are in reference to their highest state (as it were) but in the
first degree. Their light is a dusky red. The first motion of this fire being
to diffuse it self to the circumference of the ambient air, is there arriving,
beaten back and reflected through the external surface or coat of the air; not
through the thickness of it; for no doubt that was rather thinner there then
below, but through its own natural motion, whereby it moves to its
preservation; for a same cannot subsist but by the help and sustenance of the
air. It so, whither can it move? not directly back again, retorting into it
self, that being its extreme contrary motion; but rather to the sides, moving
circularly about the surface of the air, in the same manner as fire in a rooft
Furnace, where we see it first diffuseth its self directly toward the
Circumference of the Furnace, and beating against the Roof of it, does not
reverberate into it self, but reflects to the sides, and so moves along
circularly about the sides of the wall, which does more evidently appear in a
globous Furnace (Fornax reverberatoria.) The same is also manifested by the
fire of kindled Gunpowder in a Squib, which thickneth the air by impelling the
Vapors and Exhalations therein contained one upon the other, and augmenting
them by its own fumes, is almost every way resisted and beaten back, whence
therefore we observe it betakes it self to a circular motion: The reason is,
because through a circular motion it is less resisted; for one part of it
preceding the other, does not stop the following parts, but rather one part
draws another after it, or bears another before it, and moving always round,
it never meets with any other resistance; for the one part is gone, before the
other can overtake it: or what should resist it? It is just like un to two
horses going both one pace round in a Mill, the one can never be a stop to the
other, but rather the one draws the other after him, because they move both
one way. Was this motion any other but circular, it would meet with resistance.
This motion is, as it were, natural to the fire, and therefore is also of an
eval duration; for its nature is ever to move from the Center, which it does in
moving circularly, not primarily, but secondarily, it moving first directly to
the Circumference, and thence reflecting to the sides, it creeps (as it were)
all about the surface of the air, one part drawing the other after it, or
pushing and thrusting it before it, or both ways. Did not the fire continue in
motion, it would soon lose its flame: for the flame is continued by being
united; that which unites it, is, besides its own motion, the crassitude of the
air, which the fire impelling one part upon the other, renders thicker, and so
unites it self the more. So that in all Particulars this motion is natural to
the fire, and necessarily of an eval duration, because the said motion
preserves it in its being, and is its proper nature. Now were this motion the
effect of heat, it must be violent, and consequently of no long duration; for
what is violent, destroys the essence of a being. It would he violent, because
heat is produced by a violent cause from without, namely the opposition of the
air. 2. We read of no burning heat in the Mosaic Philosophy, but only of a
moving spirit, which is that I call fire, or at least an effect impressed upon
part of the Chaos. by which it moved to the surface; for you read that this
moving virtue was upon the face of the waters, before there was light, that is,
it was drawn out from the Chaos before it could raise a flame to give light.
What can be more plain? Lastly, it was necessary that the Elements should be of
an eval duration: for they were created to exist the same duration, which Adam,
had he abided in his primitive state of Innocence, would have existed. By all
which it appears, that there is no other Principle, whence its eval duration
is deducible, but from hence.

CHAP. XI. Of the second Division of the Chaos.
1. An Enarration of Effects befalling the Elements through the second Knock.
The proportion of each of the Elements in their purity to the Peregrine
Elements. 2. The ground of the forementioned proportion of the Elements. 3.
That fire and air constitute the Firmament. 4. A grand Objection answered.


I. LEt us pass to the second Division, and speculate the effects of that.
Through this vibration did the earth yet more concentrate, and the waters
gulped also upwards equally from all parts: for (as I said) the Chaos was
equally mixed, otherwise how could the waters equally cover the earth, as they
did? the waters being got atop, the air got loose in a far greater measure then
it did before, which being expanded, constituted this great tract of the air,
which now we breath into. This breach, although in a manner agreeable to the
absolute propension of fire and air, could not, since they were soexactly mixed
with the weighty elements, but give occasion of conveighing a greater
proportion of both with them. Neither was that little remaining bowl of the
great mole, whereon we now tread, destitute of all her former adherents, there
still being immerst in her the same proportion of the light Elements to the
weighty, as there is a proportion of weighty elements attending the separated
light ones. Consider now the proportion of each to it self.

1. Although the earth does harbor some of the other Elements in her, yet she
is triumphant over them in the fourth degree, that is, there are three parts
pure earth to one part of the others; and amongst these others, that constitute
a fourth part in her own bowels, it is to be conceived, that water does
transcend the air, and so the air the fire. Supposing then the earth
to-consist of 64 parts, 48 thereof are pure earth, 6 1/^ pure water, 5 1/^ pure
air, and 4 1/^ fire. Hence from its predominance it is called earth, and so the
like of water, air, and fire: to wit, water reserves 48 parts of pure water, 5
1/^ of air, 5 1/^ of earth, 5 of fire. Air is called air also from its greater
predominance over the other elements, not from its purity, as if it should be
all pure air, that is impossible. Its purity appropriates 48. water and fire
each 5 ^/^, earth 5. Fire is pure in 48. air in 6 1/^, water in 5 1/^, earth in
4 1/^. The proportion of these forementioned elements, take thus: 64 parts is
the whole, three fourths of it, which are 48, denote the proportion of each
element in its purity. Then there remains 16, which is the last fourth,
signifying the proportion of the admisted elements to the principal element, as
it is considered to be in its purity. Again, there is another proportion
observable among the perigrine elements, as they are sharers of the last
fourth, which is 16. Wherefore in earth 6 parts and a third is taken up by
water, one less, to wit 5 1/^ by air, and also one less, namely 4 1/^ by the
fire. In water five and a half is equally attributed to earth and air, one less
(that is, the overplus fraction of each complete number of earth and air makes
socially one more) to fire. The last fourth or 16 of the air is supplied in
five and a half by each of the ingress of fire and water, In five by fire. Fire
is tied to 6 1/^ of air, 5 1/^ of water, to 4 1/^ of earth.

II. The ground and reason of this proportion is, 1. That the least
predominance, whereby an element may acquire its name, must be triple, that is,
thrice as many times more in quantity, then the elements affixed to it: for did
an element in its purity overbalance the others but in two parts, then it could
hardly retain a form, whereby its nature might be sufficiently distinguished
from the others; if in more then in three parts it would be apparently
discernable that that element was mixed; if so, then it must also be
denominated by a mixed name; for the cause, why men generally impose a single
name upon some beings, that are mixed and compounded, is, because there is so
little of the extrinsick body discernable, that it does not deserve to be
named: but if discernable, then a compounded word is applied: for instance,
there is none would say, that water whereinto only a few drops of wine were
instilled, was wine and water, or Oinolympha: but they would nominate it water
alone, because there is so little wine in it that it is not gustable; but
supposing there were so much wine mingled with water, as to make it
perceptible, either by taste or smell, then no doubt they would say it was wine
and water. Even so it is here; was there more then a fourth part of extrinsick
Elements admitted to a single pure element, it would be perceptible: if so,
then we should not nominate the elements by a single name, but by a compound
one. Now that it is not perceptible is evident; for who can perceive water,
air, or fire in the earth? or who can distinguish water, earth or air in fire?
etc. Was there less then a fourth part, it would disaptate the principal
element from being an ingredient in a mixture: The reason is, because there
must be some parts adhering to such an element, whereby it may be received by
the other: for example, had fire no air affixed to it (as I have formerly
noted) it could not be received by water, but would be immediately expelled:
Neither could the earth be disposed to receive fire and air, but by the
admisture of some parts of water, some of air, and others of fire; but less
then a fourth of these adherents would be insufficient. That this is really in
effect thus, the separation of the elements is a testimony. Distill Seawater,
and rectify it often, but weigh it before distillation; the residence or fixed
Salt, wherein fire, air and earth are contained, will in little less then a
6th. or 8th. (considering that the water, which is separated, is not so pure
yet, but that it retains some part of the perigrine elements, and that another
part is dispersed through the ambient air) respond to the whole body of water.
Or thus; Weigh Seawater with distilled water, and the one shall be a sixth
part heavier then the other; then imagine that the leasts which are evaporated
of the peregrine elements are the remaining parts. Lastly, the elements being
four in company, it is very consentaneous to their number that each should be
separated by the others in a fourth.

The reason, why water constituting part of the fourth part of earth does
superate the air in one degree, is, because water is more agreeing, and that
immediately, with earth then air, because of its weight.

2. Because it is nearer to the earth then the tract of air. Fire is least in
proportion, because it is the remorest.

In the supplying the fourth of water, earth and air are in an equal
proportion, because they are equally consentaneous to water; for earth is
agreeable to it through its weight, and air through its continuity, and because
they are also of the same propinquity to water. Fire is less in quantity then
these through its remoteness: it is more then it is in earth, because it is
nearer to it.

Air contains an equal part of fire and water, by reason they are of an equal
approximation, and of an equal concord with air, the fire agreeing to it in
levity, water in continuity. Earth is in air in the same proportion, that fire
is in water, because they are equidistant to each of their allied elements, and
retain the same degree of Concord.

Fire has the same proportion of earth, which earth in its proper Region has
of fire. It is sociated to more air in one degree then water, to more water in
the same degree then air, to more water then earth in one degree also, because
their several situation is nearer to fire in one degree.

III. Summarily through this Division the Firmament was established. The
Firmament was the circumvallation of air and fire about the waters, which made
the earth and water firm in their present situation, that is, bound them up
together, and hindered them equally from all parts, from falling from the
universal Center: for the air and fire being both light elements, do as well
diffuse themselves from their own center toward the universal Center, as above
it toward the imaginary vacuum: and so by this means come to sustain the mass
of the weighty elements.

IV. Here a grand Objection, and no less Mystery offers it self, viz. that it
is improbable, that the points of earth should be of an equal number and
efficacy with the other elements, which by this section are so much expanded,
that their magnitude is divisible into infinite points (as it were) in
comparison to the points of earth, and which in respect to the minima's of air
and fire are but as one point to a million or more.

To the answering of this, call to mind that the absolute form of earth is
concentration through dense weight, and the form of air and fire diffusion from
the Center; all these absolute forms are met and balanced (thence seem to be
checked and obtused) by their reciprocal relative forms. Now the more these
relative forms are degraded from their related form, the more they acquire of
their absolute forms, and consequently greater and stronger motions. Well then,
observe this great Mystery, and the hitherto yet unknown Labyrinth of the
greatest Philosophers. The earth being degraded from her respective form,
through that the fire and the other elements are abstracted from her, has
acquired the more of her absolute form, which is to fall to her Center: this
then being her form, no wonder if she does come to so small a quantity. The
same apprehend also of water. So on the other side, fire and air being also as
much advanced from their relative to their absolute forms, do as much diffuse
from the center, as the earth and water fall to their center: so that did not
fire and air in diffusing from their center possess as great a place, as earth
and water in moving to the center possess a little place, or the earth and
water possess as little a place, as the fire and air a great place, it would be
dissonant to their natures. Besides the little place taken up by the earth and
water, is as much to them, as the great place taken up by the fire and air;
their activity to the center is as much, as the activity of the others to the
circumference. Were the earth imagined to be pure without the admixture of any
of the other elements, its supposed place would yet be one fourth less, and
likewise fire and air would in their supposed purity possess a place, yet one
fourth larger: the reason is, because the fourth part of the admisted Elements
to each pure Element, does so much the more augment or diminish its quantity,
which being prescinded, must necessarily either enlarge, or lessen their
places. Wherefore you see, that it does not hinder, but that the minima's of
the earth and water may be equal in number and activity to the minima's of the
others. Neither does it hinder but that the earth and water being expanded by
the support of the light elements (as appears in the Chaos) might have
constituted so great a mole as the Chaos was, notwithstanding it appears so
small now: for every natural point of water was almost half as much diducted
(violently as it were) by the thin levity of the air, as such a proportion of
air is now naturally through its absolute form expanded. So likewise was the
air then half as much cohibited and incrassated through its relative form by
the water, as the water is now incrassated. The like conceive of fire and earth.

Through these abstractions did all the temperate qualities of the Chaos cease,
each element did arrive almost to its absolute nature. The greatest commerce,
which they then exercised, was with each their nearest adjacent, as the fire
with air, air with water and fire, water with earth and air, earth with water,
and fire with air.

In this Scheme you may see the apparition of the second Division, which was
the third act of Creation. The fire moves circulatly, by reason of the air; the
air is cast equally over the water; the water over the earth, both pursuing a
circular course.

CHAP. XII. Of the Third Division of the Chaos.
1. The effects of the Third Knock. Why earth is heavier then water. Why water
is more weighty near the top then toward the bottom. Why a man when he is
drowned does not go down to the bottom of the Ocean. Why a potch'd Egg does
commonly rest it self about the middle of the water in a Skillet. Why the
middle parts of Salt Water are more saltish then the upper parts. 2. Whence the
earth happened to be thrust out into great protuberancies. How the earth arrived
to be disposed to germination of Plants. A vast Grove pressed into the earth.
3. The cause of the waters continual circular motion. 4. The cause of the rise
of such a variety of Plants.


1. THe third Division, or the fourth act of Creation, was whereby the most
universal Nature (naturans) did yet more purify, and as it were clarify the
Elements, in abstracting each element from its nearer, and congregating it to a
proper place of its own. These several acts of purification and exaltation are
not unlike to the operations of an Alchymist in purifying a Mineral:

1. He reduces it to a powder, and mixeth it exactly; and so it was with the
Chaos:

2. Then it is either put into a Retort, Alembick, or a Sublimatory, whereby
the light parts are separated and abstracted from the heavy ones; this happened
also in the first Division.

3. He rectifieth the light parts in repeating the former operation and exalts
it to a more sublime and pure nature, and so separates the lightest parts from
the light ones; even so it was here, God did yet more separate the fire from
the air. Touching the caput mortuum, as the earthy parts, that he dissolves in
water, and afterward to purify it, he coagulates the earth, and so separates
it from the water; in the same manner did God here coagulate the earth, and
parted it, from the waters. Further, how this is effected I shall in brief
explain to you. The water through her gravity with crassitude, does obtain a
virtue in her of squeezing, which is performed by a body that is weighty and
continuous: for by its weight it presses downwards to the center, and through
its continuity it impedes the body, which it presses, from entering into its
own substance, and so forces it to give way, which is the manner of squeezing.
Now was this body weighty and contiguous only, then it would be incapable of
squeezing, but would rather press another substance into its own Pores. Through
this squeezing virtue is water rendered capable of collecting her own parts, by
making Groves into the earth, especially being thereunto impelled by the divine
Architect. But possibly you may object, that water cannot squeeze or press the
earth, because the earth is weightier then it. I answer, that earth is
weightier then water (caeter is paribus) supposing that neither is obstructed,
or violently (as it were) detained: for instance, imagining that the mass of
earth, and of water were each of them placed in Scales, no doubt but earth
would be heavier, and its parts make a greater impulse to the Center, because
they are single in every minimum, and not continuated one to the other, and
therefore one part does not hinder the force of the other, but rather helps
it: As for water, her impulse is lesser, because her parts are continuated one
to the other, and so are a mutual hinderance to one another: This I prove, take
an hourglass and fill it with water, never a drop shall pass through the
center-hole; the reason is evident, because although its parts are weighty, yet
their continuity hinders them from stilling through, and so one part naturally
cleaving to the other, does preclude the way; but sand you see easily passes,
because it being weighty and contiguous only, the one part gives way to the
other, and impels the same through. Wherefore, I conclude, that (all conditions
being equal) earth is heavier then water. But the one being violently detained,
may prove weightier then the other, and so water is detained by earth; for
water is impeded from concentrating through the protuberance of the mass of
earth, which therefore causes a more forcible innixe in water upon the
superficial parts of the earth. I prove it, water weighs heavier upon the top
of high mountains then in the lowermost Region of the Air, because there it is
remoter from its center.

2. Water presses more atop then underneath, because it is more remote from
the center: this is apparent by men's experience in the water; for if they
suffer themselves to sink down, they feel the greatest force to press them from
the supreme parts of the water, but the lower they descend to the bottom, the
less force they perceive. Also there are many things, as an Egg dropped out of
the shell into the water in a Skillet, and others, go no deeper then half way
to the bottom; the reason is, because the superficial parts being most remote
from the center, press more forcible then the parts under them. Men when they
are drowned in the Sea, do not descend so low as to reach the ground, but so
far only as the superficial parts of the Sea thrusts them; besides there is
reason for this, a man's body, although alive, must needs be less weighty then
the thick water at the bottom of the Sea. I do not speak of the Seas depth near
shoars, but where it is of an ordinary profundity, as in the Ocean. Dissolve
Salt into water, the middle parts shall be more saltish then the superficial
parts for the same reason. Besides these experiments, the understanding affords
also an argument to demonstrate the same: If the natural propension of water be
concentration, then the further it is remote from its center, the more it must
incline to it: But the natural propension of water is concentration, ergo.

II. Since then it is yielded that water is violently detained and remote from
its center, no wonder if it does squeeze the extime parts of the earth, whereby
the earth gives way in rotundity, and is protruded either into longitude or
latitude. Water having formed but a small dent into the earth, a greater
quantity of water must needs depress thither, and so through a continuated
force, bores a greater cavern into the earth, until at last it has perduced
into her a vast grove, whereinto the body of water did retire, and so
constituted the Ocean. The earth being thus impacted by the waters, must of a
necessity be protruded above some part of the waters; and hereby was the earth
disposed to germination of plants, she being now exposed to the celestial
Influences, and moderately irrigated and foecundated by the remains of the
water.

III. The waters although congregated within this vast grove, yet they moved on
still by the same pressure; because the grove was unequal, which happened through
the unequal pressure of the waters, falling more to one place then another: for
where the waters beat in greater conflux, there certainly its force must be
greater, and consequently dig a greater cavity, and the waters bending in a
less conflux toward other places, their cavities must be more shallow. Now had
this cavity surrounded the earth equally thus, its motion would have ceased
from that violence against the earth in boring into her substance, because its
force would have been every where equal, and have procured a free passage: but
the one place being shallow, and the other deep, the shallow did resist the
pressure of the waters, through which resistance the waters did collect in
greater quantity, and collecting in greater quantity, they must needs press
against the shallow; for lower they could not press, because the earth was so
much impacted there, that it could give no more way; Ergo toward the shallow,
or must have rebounded into themselves; they could not rebound into themselves;
for that would have proved their extreme contrary motion. A shallow is removed
by being pressed upwards toward the Continent, or by being equally laid and
impacted to the earth at the bottom: so that by this means the waters are
always in a constant motion; for they meeting continually with shallows, and
being resisted by them, do continually press against them, they being pressed
down, they meet again with others, and so move round about the earth.

Or thus, water is heavier then the superficial parts of the earth, because of
its detention: (as you have read before) through this weight it moves to its
center, and heaps the earth aside; within these sides must be a hollowness,
wherein the waters are collected; but since the waters have impacted the parts
of the earth so close atop one another, that they can hardly give any more way,
and since the waters are through their greater congregation rendered more
forcible, they will not move reverberatorily into themselves, but being
reflected and beaten back (as it were) by the impacted parts of the earth, do
rather move toward the sides, because by these, each part of water is
prevented from oppressing the other, and thereby one draws the other after
it, or, the one impelleth the other before it. Now since its detention causes
this strong motion, and that this motion cannot retort into it self, certainly,
the next way must be toward the sides, in the same manner as the fire is
demonstrated to move circularly toward the sides. Supposing the waters to have
made a Channel about the earth, as we really see and know they have, it is
impossible they should ever come to rest, because they are detained from
concentration; ergo they must continually move circularly about the world; for
one part The Representation of the Chaos after its third Division.
must necessarily draw the other, and one part preceding the other, must fall
after it. This then is the undoubted and obvious cause of the Seas motion from
East to West, and from West again to the East. In like manner the fire moves
also from East to West, and from West again to the East, that is round in a
Circle. That this motion does in no wise depend upon the motion of the Sun or
Moon, I shall prove elsewhere.

IV. Through this division was the earth in part detected, whereby (as I said
before) it was rendered capable of germination, or protruding plants. God did
also congregate the earth, and separated her body from heterogeneous Elements,
yet not so, but that there remained still some small part of them. These
heterogeneous Elements (as I may call them for doctrines sake) were coagulated
into small bodies, of diverse figures. These bodies were of a different size and
proportion, according to Gods intent and purpose, for to effect various and
diverse kinds of mixed bodies. The different proportion was, that in some there
was a greater quantity of fire, in others of air, etc. The coagulation of these
small bodies, was a close and near compaction of the elements within one small
compass. Through this compaction each element was pinched in, (as it were)
which caused the same violent detention of each (as you have read to be in
water) necessarily augmenting the force and activity of each element; in fire
it effected a heat, which is nothing else but a greater and condensed motion of
the fire; (look below in the Chapt. of 2d Qualit.) in air it agitated a thin
swelling or bubling, which proceeds from a coarctation of the air, whereby it
is constipated in its motion toward the circumference by water moving to the
center. Water again is incitated to a stronger motion through the detention of
air swelling up against its compression. The earth is no less compelled to
require her natural place, the Center, then she is opposed by the fire. Were
all these violent motions (as it were) equal in their elements being formed
also in one figure, they might continue so for ever, like as if they were all
surprised by a Catoche: but being coagulated in an unequal proportion and
unlike figure, they break through one another in some progress of time, and
being confused in various figures, they effect also protrusions of no less
variety in figures. Observe that in these commistions the elements are confused
in a contrary manner then they are placed without in their entire bodies. For
here the fire against its nature (as it were) is constituted in the center,
next the air, then earth, and water is outermost. There the earth is the
center, next to it is water, etc. Herein appears the wisdom and providence of
Nature, which although casting the Elements into a fight, yet directs and
terminates them into a most perfect friendship.

These coagulated bodies are called seeds, which are multiplied according to
the number of the kinds thence budding. Seeds understand in a large sense, as
they denominate the Rudiments and first beginnings of all mixed bodies.
Otherwise Seeds are strictly attributed to living Creatures alone; as to Plants
and Animals.

Although Herbs and Plants are alone nominated by Moses to be produced through
this Division, yet the seeds of Minerals, and of their recrements (as they
erroneously term them) and of Stones were also implied, since their Creation is
no where else mentioned.

CHAP. XIII. Of the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Division of the Chaos.
1. An Enarration of the Effects of the fourth Division. That Nature created
the first bodies of every Species the greatest, is instanced in Bees, Fishes
and Fowl. That all Species are derived from one individuum. That Adam was the
greatest man that ever was since the Creation. What those Giants were, which
the Poets feigned. 2. How the Sun and Moon were created. That a Lioness is not
more vigorous then a Lion. 3. How the Stars of the Firmament were created. 4.
How the durable Clouds of the Air were created. 5. The Effects of the fifth
Division. 6. The Effects of the sixth Division. 7. The Effects of the last
Division.


AS there was a coagulation of the waters and earth, so God did in the same
manner through the fourth Division coagulate and further purify the Elements
of fire and air. This coagulation was of the heterogeneous Elements, namely of
part of the adjoined 16 parts of the peregrine Elements. These being
congregated, did condense and unite a great portion of fire, which
condensation, through a mixture of air, water and earth, constituted it into a
flame. Earth gives a body to fire, and stays its light parts; air and water
keep in the flame: Look below, where I have particularly illustrated the
generation of a flame.

1. These coagulations consisted of parts differing variously in quantity; some
greater, others less. Nature did also observe a most exact order among them: to
wit, she first coagulated one greatest body, afterward some greater bodies,
lastly, many little ones. I prove this, In all kinds there is one greatest,
because there is the least; for where there is a least, there must necessarily
be a greatest. Among Bees there is one, which is the greatest; and therefore he
is the Leader and King of all the rest: Among Fowl, we see the same, namely
that there is one greatest in each kind of them, which all the rest follow and
fly about. In a multitude of Fishes, they all swim after and about one, which
is the greatest among them, etc

2. The greatest of all kinds were created at the beginning of the world,
because that being the Superlative degree, and therefore excelling the others,
must have been created immediately by God, he creating immediately nothing, but
what is the most excellent.

Since that all beings have their rise and origin from one, it is necessary,
that this one should be the greatest. That all beings derive their rise and
original from one, is evident, in that all beings arised from the Chaos.

2. In their several kinds; as in man, all men took their Original from one
first man Adam. God proposes among the perfectest living creatures a pattern of
all the rest, which is man: Now, he being multiplied through one, although not
from one man, it is not improbable that all other Species of living creatures
multiplied through one.

3. We read in the first Chap. That God did first create the moving Creatures,
that is one of every kind; for otherwise Moses would have written that God
immediately and primarily had created two of every kind. In v. 20. Let the
waters bring forth abundantly the moving creatures, and fowls.

In v. 21. He plainly expresses that God created every living creature that
moves, that is, one of every kind, as I said before. And in the 24th. Let the
earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, not living creatures
after their kind. And in the 29 v. Every Herb bearing Seed, not Herbs: So that
this is not to be doubted of. You may object, that in the 24th. v. It is said,
that God created great Whales; ergo more then one. I deny the Consequence; for
Whales here denotes the plurality of Species of great Fishes, to wit, Porposes
Dolphins, Whales, strictly so named, etc. not the plurality of Individua in
every kind.

4. Nature is uniform, and not various in acting, ergo since she created the
first man single, and out of him a woman, it is apparent, that she observed the
same order and manner of creating every other perfect moving creature.

You may object, that according to the Antecedence, which I offer as a Maxim,
man should be created in the same manner as Beasts.

I Answer, If you consider him only as a moving Creature, having a sensitive
soul, he was; but if as he is man, that is, Men's, sivo Substantia spiritualis
and rationalis in corpus hominis vivens and sensitivum a Natura infusa; a Mind,
or a spiritual rational substance infused by God into a living and moving body:
then no doubt but the action is various, since it is in diversa actionis specie.

5. God acts by the fewest Means; but one is fewer or less then more; ergo.

If then all beings are multiplied through one, then this one must necessarily
be the greatest. I prove the Consequence. You are to apprehend, that man as he
is an Animal is propagated in the same manner as other Animals. Being then
propagated through one, that one must have been endued with the greatest and
strongest virtue of propagation, because that wasting and weakening in progress
of time could not be sufficient to last out a whole race: this greatest virtue
must be assixed to a proportionate subject or body, which must then be the
greatest body; for the greatest virtue cannot be contained in a less subject
then the greatest body: this is evident in a great flame, which must be
maintained in a great place.

2. We may remember out of History, that the nearer men lived to the first man,
the greater and stronger bodies they had; the longer they lived; the more
numerous issue they had; and the more generous, and the less exercised in
wickedness, all which proceeded from a stronger virtue and a greater body. If
so, then it is not improbale, that the first man, and all the first of other
kinds of Animals were the greatest, for the same reason. Besides we read in
Joshua 14. 15. That Arba (in some Bibles written Adam) was the greatest among
the Anakims. Which most Interpreters judge to be spoken of the first man Adam.

But possibly you may reply, that if Adam was the greatest man, he must have
been thought to be a Giant, but a Giant is monstrous: wherefore Adam was not
the greatest man. I deny the Minor; for monstrous is that, which does
degenerate from the Species, so that it makes a difference between that which
is adjudged to be a Monster, and the Species; as the abundance or defect of
parts, or a deformation in some or all parts, through which its Subject is
rendered different from the Species, to which it was intended; but a great,
greater, or greatest man is no more a Monster then a little, less, or least
man; because there is no difference between either in number, form or figure of
parts. It Is true, Giants have been generally received for Monsters, but then
they were differing from other men, in number and figure of parts; as the
Cyclopes, a great sort of people, feigned by the Poets to have had but one eye
in the midst of their Forehead, and to be Vulcans Journeymen, employed in
making weapons for Jupiter. Grandeur of body, if actuated by sufficiency of
vigorous spirits, is a perfection denoting strength of all the animal and
vegetative faculties, fitted for long life, and propagation, which therefore
must not be detracted from the first of all kinds.

II. Hence I may then safely infer, that in the Firmament the greatest part of
the heterogeneous elements, and a great proportion of fire were coagulated into
the greatest flame, which was the Sun. Out of the courser part of the Sun, God
created another great body; next to the greatest the greatest, which was the
Moon. For as Earth, Waters, and Animals were defaecated by having other bodies
formed out of their courser matter, so it was also in the Element of fire. This
is most obvious in Animals, whose Female was formed out of the courser part of
the Male, whereby it becomes more excellent and vigorous in all its actions.
This may be contradicted, in that a Lioness is taken to be more vigorous and
fierce then a Lion. I Answer, that this kind of sierceness and apparent vigor
is in all Females, but it is not lasting, more a spurt and show of vigor and
fierceness, then real and durable.

III. These two great flames did by their hourly motion produce other great
ones, which again propagated (as it were) lesser, and thence little ones, which
were those, by us now called Stars. But of these more particularly hereafter.

IV. In the Air the like coagulation formed the thin Clouds consisting of a
great part of Air, incrassated through a smaller quantity of water, and
punctually divided by the same proportion of fire, balanced and incorporated
with the least measure of earth. These Clouds have their continual abode in
the air, seldom vanishing. Their Color is bluish, arising from its
incrassation through water, and incorporation with earth: for the air of it
self is so thin, that it is insufficient to unite a light, or cause reflection,
but being reduced to a thicker consistence by the co-expansion of water with
it, it becomes capable of uniting, reflecting and propagating a light; now were
there no Particle of earth affixt to this mixture, the color would be
transparent, lucid, or Chrystalline, But being somewhat obtenebrated through
the density of earth, is changed into a light blew, or light Sky-colour.

V. Thus did the great Arcess Nature make her process in the elaboration,
purification and exaltation of the Elements; neither was she yet arrived to her
ultimate intention or end, but proceeded in her scope by a more arct and pure
coagulation of parts in dividing the heterogeneous parts yet more from the body
of water, and so knitting them together again. This was the fifth Division,
whereby God divided the purest and subtilest part of the Elements before
divided and coagulated from the course and impure parts, and promoted them to
an arcter coagulation; this was, as it were, a fourth rectification of the
Elements. In the water the coagulated bodies through the vivification of the
Planetary influences, became Fishes: In the Air Fowl.

VI. The Sixth Division respected the Earth, out of whose more purified and
rectified parts protruded to her superficial Region, Cattle and Beasts were
animated by the same Influences.

Lastly, By virtue of the Seventh Division Man was created, and formed out of
the most exalted Quintessence of the purest coagulalation of Earth, animated
through the Benign vivifying Beams of the Sun, after which a (Men's, sive
Spiritus, sive Lux Rationalis) a Mind, or a rational spirit, or Light was
inspired or infused from God into this most sublime Tabernacle.

The Representation of the Chaos after its latter Divisions.


How a Creature is vivified and animated, I shall demonstrate in its proper
place.

Man again was further purified and defaecated by having a woman created out of
his grosser and less digested Parts.

CHAP. XIV. Of the Second and Third Absolute Qualities of the Elements.
1. What is understood by Second Qualities. 2. What the Second quality of Earth
is. 3. Aristotle's Definition of Density rejected. 4. The Opinions of
Philosophers touching the Nature of Density. 5. The forementioned Opinions
confuted. 6. The Description of Indivisibles according to Democritus disproved.
That all Figures are divisible excepting a Circular Minimum. That Strength
united proves strongest in a round Figure: and why. 7. What the Second Quality
of Fire is. Cardan, Averrhoes, Zimara, Aristotle, Tolet, and Zabarel their
Opinions touching the Nature of Rarity confuted. 8. The Second Quality of
Water. Aristotle, Joh. Grammat. Tolet, Zabarel and Barthol. their sense of
Thickness and Thinness disproved. 9. What the Second Quality of Air is. 10.
What is intended by third, fourth or fifth Qualities. An Enumeration of the
said Qualities. What Obtuseness, Acuteness, Asperity, Levor, Hardness,
Rigidity, Softness, Solidity, Liquidity and Lentor are, and their kinds.


1. THe Second Qualities are those, which do immediately descend, or emanate
from the first without any nearer interposing. Their Number is adequated to the
Number of the first qualities, and therefore are only four: because an
immediate and univocal cause cannot produce more immediate and univocal Effects
then one.

Second qualities proceed from the Elements either (...), or (...). Second
qualities (...), or per se, are such as emanate primarily from the absolute
forms of the Elements.

Second qualities (...), or per accidens, emanate primarily from the respective
forms of the Elements.

In the Precedent Chapters has been indistinctly treated of the first and
second qualities united into one, as really they are, but they are tow, and
distinct from each other ratione, because we conceive them distinctly, and
apprehend one to be the cause of the other. The reason why I did then propose
the first and second qualities as one form of the Elements, is, because there I
handled them as they were really inherent in their Subjects. Here my purpose is
to describe them as they are successively apprehended by us one after the other.

II. The first quality, power, or (...) of the earth is gravity with
contiguity: the second or next quality emanating nearest thence is density; for
conceiving a thing to be weighty and contiguous in its parts, that, which we
apprehend next, is density; for if a thing is weighty, or pressing to the
Center, and its parts contiguous, it cannot but be pressed very close, since
its parts are contiguous whereby they give and make way to and for one another;
which closeness of parts emanating from a contiguous weight is called density.

III. Aristotle describes Density to be that, whereby a substance contains
much matter in small dimensions. I cannot well guess what he calls much matter;
whether he means much matter only without the intention of its form, or much
matter with much of its form. The first is not possible; for whenever matter is
augmented, its form is always intended with it; and likewise the diminution of
matter attends the remission of its form, which is evident in fire; cast more
fuel to it, and its first quality will also be intended. If he implies the
last, where then consists the difference between Density and Rarity? For dense
bodies contain no more matter then rare ones; for each their matter is
adequately extended to the extension of their form. Does a Lump of earth
contain more matter then a tract of air of the same proportion? No certainly,
for there is as much matter in that proportion of air, as there is in the same
of earth. Matter is that, whereout a thing is made; but there is as much of
that, whereout the air is made, in the air in the same extent of place, as
there is in earth, whereout that is made. But answer me, whereby will you know,
what has much matter in a little place or dimension, and what has little
matter in a great place? You will say, by its weight: So that whatever is
weighty, that contains more matter then that which is light. Why shall a body
be said to have more matter from its gravity, then another from its Levity? Or
why shall a light body have but little matter, and a weighty one much? If a
weighty body has more matter, because it is weighty; then it is more a body
then a light body, but that is absurd. By more matter, I mean magis materia.
But you answer your meaning to be major materia; neither that; for as I said
before, the least particle of air has as much, whereout it is made, as the
least particle of earth: It is true, it has not so much weight; for it has
none, but weight is not the matter of a thing, but its form; how then can a
weighty thing be said to have much matter, because of its weight? Wherefore let
me tell you, that density does not derive from the matter of a thing, but from
its form, and that it is not the Modus solius materiae, but totius.

The same may be urged against the Paripatetick Definition of Rarity, which is,
whereby a body contains little matter under great dimensions. The matter,
which is to be contained under great or little dimensions, must be of that
quantity as to fill its place, which rare and dense bodies do equally under the
same proportion. But doubtless these Definitions cannot be defended, unless
they be likewise free to defend a penetration of bodies.

IV. We find a very dense contest among Philosophers about the manner of
condensation and rarefaction.

1. Scotus in 4. Distinct 22. Quaest. 4. opiniates, that there are new parts of
quantity produced in rarefaction, and other old ones corrupted.

2. Marsilius in his Metaph. Quest. 9. Art. 2. asserteth, that in rarefaction
and condensation the whole or entire old quantity is corrupted.

3. Others to salve their Doctrine of Condensation and Rarefaction, are
constrained to affirm a penetration of quantity, which they say, may naturally
happen, provided it be not of all, but of some parts only.

4. Hurtado, Phys. Disput. 15. Sect. 5. Subject. 4. lays down a Principle
invented by his Master, which according to his Judgment proves an Expedient to
expound the nature of Rarity and Density. There are (says he) certain
indivisibles contained in bodies, through the inflation or puffing up of which,
bodies do acquire a greater or less place. But to avoid all inconveniences,
they allow these indivisible points not to be formally only, but virtually also
divisible and extensible according to place and force impelled upon them. To
this Opinion does Arriaga also subscribe, Disp. 16. Sect. 9.

5. The J^suits of Conimbrica, Lib. 1. Cap. 5. q. 17. Art. 1. state, that
Rarity and Density are consistent in a certain quality, inherent in quantity,
through which that quantity is contracted or extended to a greater or less
space. In fine, after a long sweat, they are forced to confess ingenuously with
Hurtado, that this difficulty is not to be cleared.

V. The subtle Doctor runs far beyond his Byas in admitting a natural
corruption in parts, and that happening almost every moment; wherefore he is
rejected by all in this particular.

What the Assertors of the third Opinion have stiffely affirmed in their whole
Philosophy, that they are now reduced to deny, and exposed to a probation of a
penetration of quantity: which if a quantity is consistent of potential parts
only, and indivisible into indivisibilities, then no question, but it will go
for them; for then it remains indisputable, that in a Line the points do all
penetrate one another, and consequently must consist out of infinite potential
parts.

Hurtado and Arriaga do now yield to actual formal indivisibles, but yet
virtually divisible: How an indivisible can be inflated, they do omit the
illustration. This is most certain, that contiguous indivisibles are
inextensible, and therefore may not be inflated.

2. This Inflation is violent, but there are many bodies naturally dense, as
the earth, and therefore inflation being violent, is not a means tending to
addensation. Besides, they pass by to express their meaning of Indivisibles,
whether such as Zeno and Democritus teached, or others.

VI. If they side with Democritus, they fall into a greater Error; for his
Indivisibles were, 1. Infinite. 2. Fluctuating in a void place. 3. Of various
Figures.

All three most notorious contradictions: For can a thing be infinite, and yet
be terminated with Figures; a plain Contradiction.

2. Can finite bodies be produced out of infinite material Causes? If material
causes are infinite, the body constituted by them must also be infinite.
Wherefore another Contradiction.

3. There is no real vacuum, but an imaginary one.

4. Can a thing be indivisible, and yet be under various figures? There is no
figure indivisible, but a round Minimum; because all its parts are fallen
equally so close to the Center, that they escape a real division thereby,
although not a mental one; but other figures, as Triangles, must of necessity
be devisible; because all figures are made out of a Circle or Rotundity, for
take away the Angles of a Triangle, Quadrangle, etc. and there remains a
Circle. The reason why a round Minimum escapes division is, because there is
nothing sticking out, whereupon an extrinsick Agent can take hold, because its
extreme imaginary parts are strongest in being equally united to the Center;
and therefore one imaginary part is so strengthened by the other, and fastened
to the other, that any real division is impossible upon them; but a triangular,
or any other angular figure is divisible, because its real parts are unequally
allied to the Center, whence there arises a strong opposition in one respect,
and yet a small resistance in another; for the angles do receive the force of
an extrinsick Agent, but a round minimum shoves it off, and so makes but little
resistance, and yet a great opposition; we see that a small round Bullet shall
pass where a great angular body shall not, although impelled with the same
force, and do consist of the same matter: the reason is, because in a round
figure there is less resistance, and the opposition is the greater, because of
the union of parts. I have often thought upon the intention of that ordinary
Saying, Vis unita est fortior: Strength united is made stronger. This holds
good only in a round figure; for therein force is most united; for all its
parts are equally allied to the Center, and every part helps the other, and
makes no resistance, but great opposition. This appears in your round
short-arst Fellows, who shall carry a greater burden, then the biggest and
tallest men. I do remember that I have seen at a Sea-Village called Scheeveling
in the Low Countries, a dozen men or fewer, remove and carry a Pink of no very
small burden, upon their backs from the shore into the Sea. Their strength was
very improportionable to move so great a body, but the placing of themselves in
a round Figure, did soon square their force to the Bulk. Three of them were
placed before at one side of the bows, three on the other side, three more on
each side of the Ship, and so those twelve moved with their backs one against
the other circularly, not thrusting the Ship forward or from them, for then
they could not have done it; but every man moved circularly to the Center, and
against the force of his Diametrical opposite, and so lifted the fore parts of
the Ship up upon their backs, which being a little raised from the ground, fell
or moved forward through her own declining weight. Touching the men themselves,
each of them put himself into a circular posture, applying his back against the
Ship, resting his hands and arms upon his Knee, and inclining his Head and Neck
toward his Breast. But this by the way.

The Conimbricenses endeavor to help the matter by shifting it off to a
quality inherent in quantity. Indeed I had always apprehended a quality
according to the Peripateticks, to have inhered in a substance, and not in
quantity; for it is absurd to assert in their Philosophy, that one Accident
inheres in the other. Nevertheless they intend Matter by Quantity; wherefore by
the way you may observe, that nolentes volentes, they cannot apprehend any
thing by Matter but quantity, as I have proved before. Further, to patch the
cause of Density upon Quality, is a blind shifting; for Quality is so remote a
name, and there are so many qualities, that unless they indigitate to a
particular sensible quality, they effect little.

Their vain Groapings, Guessings and Ignorances depend upon the Cloud, which
they leave upon the nature of Density and Rarity; for did they but study the
true Definition of either, it would not a little contribute to their
Information.

In the first place, They imagine Density to be a violent quality, whereas you
see it is natural.

2. They make no distinction between Density and Thickness; for Thickness does
in the same sense (although improperly) contain much matter in little
Dimensions, and notwithstanding they are different: and so does Thinness
contain little matter under great Dimensions, as improperly as Rarity; Wherein
is Rarity then distinct from Thinness? nevertheless do Authors affirm that many
thin bodies are dense. The same is attested by Cardan. How then can the
above-given Definition stand good? A thing shall then contain at once much
matter in small dimensions, and little matter in great dimensions, ergo a thing
is thin and thick, rare, and dense at once.

No question it is also an erroneous Assertion, that some thin bodies are
essentially dense, or that any thick bodies are essentially rare; neither is
Tenuity or Crassitude the cause of Density (as Scaliger does well infer in his
283 Exerc.) but a contiguous Gravity.

VII. The first power or Form of Fire is Levity with Contiguity. The Second
next slowing thence is Rarity, which is an expansion or diduction of a body
that is light with Contiguity. This follows Levity with Contiguity, because a
thing which is contiguously light cannot but be diducted. Scaliger does justly
except against Cardan in Exerc. 4. You say that the reason or manner of a rare
and dense body is taken from the multitude or paucity of matter. Moreover it is
not the multitude, or paucity of Matter makes Density or Rarity, neither does
Density cause the multitude of matter, or Rarity the paucity of it. The
Demonstration is the same for both; because the same body may be rarefied or
condensed without the increase or decrease of Matter.

Averrhoes, Lib. 4. Phys. Comment. 84. does hesitate very much in this
Particular, as appears by his contradictory affirmations; for in that place he
asserts, that Rarity and Density are contraries in quantity: Again in the next
following Comment. he says, that Rarity and Density are not of the essence of
quantity. In Lib. 7. Phys. Com. 15. he affirms, Rarity and Density to be
qualities: but in Lib. 1. Metaph. Com. 15. he refers them to the Predicament of
Situs: and Lib. 8. Phys. Com. 77. he says, that Rarefaction and Condensation
are Local Motions.

Zimara does labor to draw all these various Dictates of Averrhoes to a good
sense. When he seemed to place them in the Category of Situs (says he) his
intention was only to relate the Opinion of other men. In saying that
Rarefaction and Condensation were in the Predicament of quantity, he meant that
quantity did consecute them, but not formally; for a greater quantity does
follow Rarity, and thence the possession of a greater place: wherefore
Rarefaction is primarily and essentially an alteration, and a motion to
quality, but secondarily and by consequence it is to a greater quantity, and a
larger place.

Tolet. Lib. 4. Phys. Cap. 9. Text 84. tells us the Opinion of Aristotle upon
this intricate Point. He expounds his Judgment upon Rarefaction, which (in
short) implies, Rarity and Density to be two contrary qualities, educed out of
the power of matter, as others also are; for when a thing is condensed or
rarefied, that does not happen properly, because something is expelled, or
something does enter, or because the parts are conjoined among themselves, or
are separated by reason of a (vacuum) voidness; but because such a quality,
Rarity, or Density is educed out of the power of matter, so as that its Subject
should be changed; as when it is made hot or cold: for the Ancients said, that
no part of a thing was changed in Rarefaction or Addensation, but that its
parts came only somewhat nearer, or were removed from between themselves.
However Aristotle's Dictates contain nothing of this: but when a thing is
rarefied or condensed, the whole and the parts too are changed by an accidental
mutation, in receiving a quality educed out of the power of matter; which is
apparent, because in a rare body every part is rare; which if Rarity happened
only through the separation of parts among themselves, the parts doubtless
would remain dense, which is false, as appears in things that are rare, and
most in the Elements.

A great deal ado about nothing. That which through it self is most obvious,
they involve into obstruseness through their Cavils. Whether Averrhoes intended
his words in that meaning, as Zimara comments, or not, (which is more probable,
because he does not give the least hint of an indirect sense of his words, and
therefore they are to be understood in their direct intention: As for Zimara
his reconciliation, that alleging no reason, and since the same might be
guessed of his words, although he had purposed them for a contrary
signification, it does not merit any acceptance) is not material, either
promising no truth or evidence.

Tolet. rejects the Judgment of the Ancients upon this Particular, but has not
the ingenuity to add Reasons, to consute them, only from an inbred
School-bending to Aristotle, says as he is told. He declares then with the
Philosopher, that in Rarefaction and Addensation the whole and parts are
changed by an accidental mutation in receiving a quality educed out of matter,
because in a rare body every part is rare.

In the first place, his Reason is weak; for in a rare body every part is not
rare, as appears in the air, which they term to be rare; wherein many dense
parts, as black Clouds, are contained, nevertheless the whole Body is called
Air a majori.

2. Supposing that every part of the whole is rare, he infers nothing, but that
every part, or the whole is rare, which is idem per idem.

2. If Rarity (says he) were caused through separation of parts among
themselves, the parts would remain dense. It seems by Rarity and Density he
apprehends nothing else but the diminution or augmentation of quantity; for in
the same Comment. he writes thus, You must note that to be made little out of
great is to be condensed, and out of little great to be rarefied. Here he
contradicts himself; before he stated them qualities, now they are changed into
quantities. But to his Reason. It Is true (as he says) if Rarity were caused
through separation of parts in a mean body among themselves, the parts would
remain dense, supposing that the light parts were separated from it. But
supposing the dense parts of a mean (that is equally consistent of dense and
rare parts) body, the remaining parts would be rare.

2. A dense body is not rarefied through any separation of its parts, or
inflation of its minima's, but by the adjoining of light and rare parts to it.

I wonder what accidental change it is he means; it must be either to quantity,
and then it is the same with augmentation and diminution; or to quality, and
then it is an alteration, or a locomotive quality: but he mentions none.
Supposing it to be a quality, the question is, whether this does arise in that
subject with the adherence to its primitive matter of the extrinsick Agent, or
whether it does migrate out of its own subject into another. It is not the
latter; for I have proved in my Dispute of Powers, that an Accident does not
migrate out of one Subject into another. If the first, then it is by the
entering of another body between the parts that are separated, and what body is
that but fire? It is that, which through its contiguous lightness does render a
dense body rare, and so condensation is by expelling the light parts, or
admitting more parts of a dense body, as of earth, which does condensate
through its contiguous gravity. Wherefore we are not forced to grant a vacuum
in Rarefaction, because a body is rarefied through the supplying of the
supposed void spaces by the presence of fire. Neither need we to assert a
penetration of bodies in Condensation, since that those parts, which are
supposed to be penetrated into the substance of others, are expelled. It is not
then, as Tolet writes, that rarefaction is become great out of little without
the apposition or detraction of a new Substance; for were it so, then of a
necessity there must be allowed a penetration of bodies in condensation, and a
vacuum in Rarefaction: wherefore Scaliger says well in his 4th. Exerc. That
there can be no addensation or rarefaction (although Rarity and Density are
really in them) in any single body. Ergo dum inter unum minimum natural ignis
puri, and minima continua circumsita nullum medium corpus intercedat, quonam
igitur modo queunt esse propius ant longinquius sine intervallo, mutuave cor
porum penetratione? Wherefore since between one natural minimum of pure fire,
and the surrounding continuated minima's (which are the minima's of the air)
there is no middle body interposed, how then can they be nearer or further
without an interval or mutual penetration of bodies? The reason (as I said
before) is, because without the adjunction of another body to a single one,
there is no rarefaction or condensation.

Observe by the way, that many of the Parepateticks make a twofold rarity in
bodies. The one they confound with a thinness, as you may read in Arist. Lab.
2. de part. Anim. Cap. 1. And Grammat. Lib. 2. de ortu and inter. Context. 8.
This they refer to the Category of Quality, and does consecute heat. The other,
which is the more frequent and proper acception of Rarity (as they say) is,
which does not consist in a Tenuity of a substance, but in the distance of
parts between one another, and so they call a sponge rare, because it has
parts distant from one another through an interposed space, not really void,
which contains no body, but is filled with another thin and insensible body;
as in a Sponge, whose parts are called void, wherein notwithstanding air is
contained. This kind of Rarity they refer to the Category of Situs. I take them
in this last Acception, and demand, whether it is not the air, which causes
that situation and distance of parts? For the Sponge is condensed, through
expressing the air by compression of the Sponge: If so, then it is not a single
quality educed out of the power of matter, but the entering of the air into its
pores, which does rarifie (as they term it) the Sponge.

Zabarel, Lib. de Calore Coelest. Cap. 3. attributes Rarity to the causality of
heat, and density to Coldness. But before he had proposed an Objection, which
was, that heat is produced by rarefaction and attrition: To this he strives to
answer below, but finding he could not go through with it, recants, and states,
That in the Elements, as they are simple, their heat does produce Rarity, and
so does Rarity reciprocally produce heat. An absurdity, to affirm the effect to
be the cause of its cause, and the cause to be the effect of it self.

2. Heat is not the cause of Rarity, because fire is the rarest of all in its
own Region, and yet, as they confess, fire is not hot in its own Seat.

VIII. The first quality of water is gravity with continuity: the second
emanating thence is Crassitude, which is a thick consistence, exporrected
through all its dimensions. You will grant me, that Crassitude proceeds from an
arct and near union of parts, or from a close compression of the said parts.
This compression and union derives from gravity; this gravity being continuous,
does necessarily cause a crassitude; for were it contiguous, it would effect a
density. There is nothing, unless it be water, or waterish bodies, that is
thick, as Oils, Gums, Rozzens, fat, Tallow, are all waterish so far at they
are thick, yet not without the admistion of most Air, Ice, Crystal, Diamonds,
and most Precious stones are waterish, and therefore thick. Choler, Pepper, the
Stars, etc. are rare, because they are fiery, that is, participate more of
fire, then of any other Element. Flies, Cobwebs, Clouds. etc. are thin, because
they are ayery. All earthy bodies are dense; as Minerals, Stones, etc. Now as
it is necessary, that all the Elements should meet in every body, so it is
necessary, that there should concomitate Rarity, Density, Tenuity and
Crassitude in each mixed body. Wherefore do not think it strange that thinness
and thickness should be in one body, although they are counted contraries among
Authors.

I cannot but admire that all Philosopers to this very day should have
confounded the signification of these words, thick, dense, thin, rare, naming
thick bodies dense, thin ones rare, and so reciprocally, as if they were one,
whereas there is a great distinction between them.

Aristotle, Johan. Grammat. Tolet, Zabarel, and many others take thinness and
rarity to be the same, as also thickness and density; whereas you may now
evidently know, that they are altogether distinct, and wherein they are so. It
is erroneous to say, that water is dense, or fire thick, air rare, etc. but
water is alone thick, air thin, earth dense, and fire rare.

Bartholin. Lib. 1. Phys. Cap. 5. defines Thickness by an adulterine cause:
Thickness (says he) is thought to derive from coldness and density. And a
little before he described Density to be derived from coldness and thickness.
Mark his thick dullness in asserting thickness to be the cause of density, and
density of thickness. The cause must be prior causato natura saltem, but here
neither is prior. He makes a difference in their names, but in re he concludes
them to be one.

IX. The first quality of Air is Levity with Continuity; its second is Tenuity,
which is a thin consistence of a substance; wherefore Thinness and Thickness
are (as it were) modi consistentiae. Heat is not the cause of tenuity in air,
because heat is accidental to Air, and tenuity is essential, or at least
co-essential; but that, which is accidental and extrinsick, cannot be the cause
of that, which is essential and intrinsic. The next effect we can imagine to
emanate from lightness with continuity, or the greatest diduction, and yet
remaining continuated, must needs be Tenuity.

Besides these, there are some more qualities restant; as Obtuseness and
Acuteness, Asperity and Levor, Solidity and Liquidity, Softness and Hardness,
Lentor and Friability.

It is a mistake in Authors to derive the Original of these Qualities from the
Elements, as they constitute a mixed body, and thence to term them Qualities of
a mixed body. To the contrary, they do emanate from the Elements as they are
conceived in their absolute form, as has been proved.

These Qualities you may nominate third, fourth, and fifth, according as the
understanding does apprehend the one to be before the other in Nature, although
not in Time.

The third qualities of the Elements are Obtuseness, Acuteness, etc. I prove
it: because we apprehend them next to the second qualities; for the
understanding, in discerning these sensible qualities, is lead by the Senses as
its Pilots; now our tact or feeling being the first in esse and operari, is
also employed in distinguishing those first, second and third Qualities: and
for that reason they are all called tactible or tangible qualities. The first
action made by any of the Elements upon the tact is local motion, as Gravity
and Levity: for feeling any Element, its weight or lightness would be the First
thing we should perceive: the next would be its rarity or density. The third,
acuteness or hebetude: the fourth, asperity or levor, the fifth, hardness or
softness; the sixth, solidity or liquidity; the seventh, lentor or friability.

There is a twofold Acuteness formally differing from one another:

1. An Acuteness deriving from Density. 2. An Acuteness emanating from Rarity.
Acuteness is a quality whereby our tact is most divided.

Obtuseness is a quality whereby our tact is least divided.

Acuteness is in Fire and Earth, but in a different manner.

Acuteness in fire is a rare acuteness, whereby it most divides our tact,
through its parts being contiguously diducted, or spread from the Center.

The acuteness inherent in earth is a dense acuteness, whereby it divides our
tact through a dense acuteness, or minima's moving through their pressing
weight to the Center.

Obtuseness is a quality following crassitude and tenuity, whereby its subject
compresseth our tact: or divides it less or least and in longer time.

Obtuseness in air is a quality immediately produced by its tenuity and
continuous Expansion; for were it contiguous, it would be acute, but being
continuous, one part hinders the other from penetrating or dividing any
objected body; And so its parts acting together and equally, they effect a
compression. This compression or obtuseness in the air is thin and subtle, and
more potent then that in water, because it resists less, and therefore is
also less opposed, and through its subtility is capable of making stronger
opposition.

Obtuseness in water issues out of a thick quality, or from its continuous
depressing virtue. This Obtuseness, and that in air, as also acuteness in fire
and earth, are altogether different (as I said before) but through the
narrowness of the Language, I am compelled to attribute each to two several
beings, adding some notes of Distinction. The same understand of all the other
derived Qualities.

Asperity is a quality immediately consecuting Acuteness; and Levor is a
quality emanating from Hebetude or Obtuseness. Asperity (more plainly) is an
inequality or roughness in the surface of a body; this, experience, tells us,
proceeds from a sharpness or Acuteness. Levor is an equality of the Surface
descending from Hebetude, or a continuous pressure or diduction.

Asperity in fire is a rare, diffusing and vibrating asperity: that in earth is
a dense, heavy contracting asperity. I prove it, our feeling certifieth us that
fire is a rare, diffusing and vibrating roughness; and so feeling earth, we
feel a dense, heavy and contracting roughness.

From a contiguous and dense Asperity spreades hardness: which is a quality,
where by its subject is difficulty pressed down into it self. So thin Levor
begets softness, which is a quality, whereby its subject easily gives way
into it self to pressure. Hardness in earth may properly be termed Rigidity, or
a rugged hardness, because the earth does only of all the Elements possess its
center, and therefore cannot introcede into it self.

That Rigidity is caused by Asperity, its ordinary Definition among Physicians
does testify: Rigidity (say they) is a hardness with Asperity, or a roughness,
that is from asperity.

From a continuous and thick Obtuseness derives a smooth hardness, such as is
conceived in Crystal or Ice, and is alone proper to water.

Softness in fire being unequal or rough, is, whereby it gives way toward its
Circumference, if pressed from without.

Softness in air being equal and smooth, is, whereby it gives way toward its
Circumference, if pressed from without.

Solidity is an effect of hardness, through which a body is consistent, that
is, incapable of flowing; So water is a smooth solid body, because of its
peculiar hardness: and earth is a rugged solid body, likewise because of its
proper hardness.

Liquidity is an effect of Softness, whereby a body is apt to flow, or to be
diducted. In Fire it is rare and acute; in Air thin and obtuse.

Solidity produces Friability, which is a quality, whereby its parts are
separable From one another in minute particles; wherefore since Solidity cannot
give way by flowing, it gives way through Friability.

Lentor is a quality produced by Liquidity, and is, whereby a body is rendered
deductible by reason of its continuity of Parts.

We may otherwise apprehend these qualities to differ from one another secundum
magis and minus thus; Asperity is a greater Acuteness of parts: Hardness is a
greater Asperity, or thick Levor: Solidity is a greater Hardness: Levor is a
greater Obtuseness: Softness is a greater thin Levor: Liquidity is a greater
Softness.

1. THe. Respective Qualities of the Elements are such, as do consecute the
congress of the same Elements: They are called Qualities per accidens, in
respect they are supposed to befall them after their production in their
absolute Form. They are withal termed Second Qualities, because they are
produced by the First Qualities of the Elements in their congress.

II. The Second Accidental Quality emanating from fire in its concurse to
mixture is Heat. The manner of production of heat is accidental and violent:
That it is accidental, is evident, because fire in its own Region (as the
Parepateticks themselves allow) is seated beyond all degrees of heat, or at
least does not burn. It does not burn, because it flames not; for nothing does
burn unless it is exalted to a flame, or contains a flame within it self. A red
hot Iron burns no longer, then the flame of the fire lodges within its
pores: nay it does not so much as effect warmth, unless the fire, that is
contained within its pores, flames a little; but this flame is so little, that
it flees the eyesight. If a red hot Iron burns strongly, because it
contains a great flame, and the same Iron burns less and less, as the fire
flaming diminishes, it is a certain sign, that where its flame is extinguished,
its heat is vanished with it. Again, none ever doubted, but that in a flaming
Torch there is an actual burning fire: Now tell me, when the flame is ready to
go out, whither that fire goes. Your Answer must be, that it is dispersed
through the Air; but then the fire being dispersed through the air is no more
hot; no, not warm, because it does not flame: wherefore fire naturally and per
se is not hot. I ask you again, whether there is not fire contained in Aqua
fortis? You will answer me affirmatively; But then, does this fire burn? No, it
does not so much as warm your hand through a Glass. If you make the fire in the
Aqua fortis flame, you will find that it shall not only warm, but also burn
your hand. Power Aqua fortis upon any Metal, as upon the Filings of Brass,
contained in a precipitating Glass, you will soon see it change into a flame,
smoke, and burning heat through the Glass. That it flames, the light, which
appears within the Glass, testifies.

Possibly you may object, that Aqua fortis if powered upon cloth or your hand,
will burn, and yet not flame.

To this I answer, That Cloth through the subtility of its hairs does open
the body of Aqua fortis, which being opened, the fire comes forth, and it
withheld by a thickened air adhering to the Cloth, which causes a subtle
flame, yet seldom visible, although sometimes there appears a Glance. The like
is effected by pouring it upon your hand, and then we say, it does inflame the
hand, because there appears a subtle flame: Wherefore Physicians say well,
such a part is enflamed, when it burns, because there is no burning heat
without a flame.

Nevertheless the fire contained within a mixed body may burn, and yet its heat
may not be sensible, but then its flame is withal imperceptible: The reason is,
because the thickness and density of the circumjacent Elements do hinder the
penetration of heat out of that body, as also of its light.

III. It is violent, by reason its production is depending upon an extrinsick
and violent detention. The manner of it is thus: Fire being violently
concentrated in a mixture, striveth to pass the Pores of the earth, which it
does with little difficulty; but being arrived to a thick air, the fire is
there detained by it, notwithstanding do the other parts yet remaining within
the Pores of the earth continually and successively follow one another, and
being all united and condensed (which is violent to the fire) they make a
greater force (for strength united is made stronger) whereby they dilate and
expand the incrassated Air; this Dilatation and expansion of the Air by fire
condensed within its belly or bladder, is that, which we call a Flame. Now how
fire begets heat, and becomes burning, I shall instantly explain.

First let me tell you what heat is. You know that we name all things according
to their natures, which they manifest to us in affecting our senses: So we call
that a Sound, which affects our Ears, and according as it does divide our
auditory spirits and nerves, we nominate it harsh or shrill, etc. Even so we
name a thing hot, when it does in a certain manner divide our tangent spirits
and Membrane; or shorter, we say a thing is hot, when it feels hot. When our
spirits are a little shaked, or moved by small and loose Particles of flames,
then it seems to be warm; but when our tangent parts are divided by dense and
forcible Particles of fire, then we say, it burns; so that it is only a
division of our tangent parts by the dividing and penetrating parts of fire,
which we call burning. This division is different from a cut or incision, which
is made by a dense acute body, and therefore it separates the whole part; but
through the acuteness of fire, its ayry and waterish parts only are divided
contiguously, because the fire is contiguous. Now the more the parts of fire
are condensed, the stronger it penetrates, divides and consumes. The reason,
why burning fire does consume or dissolve a body into ashes, is, because it
breaks through the ayry and waterish parts by its great force of contiguous
lightness, which parts being discontinued and expelled, the earth is left
alone, because the ayry and waterish parts were the gl^w of that body. Fire
does only break through the ayry and waterish parts, because they only do
resist (as it were) the fire; as for the earthy minims, they do not so much
resist the fire, because being contiguous, they give way to its passing.

IV. Secondly, That heat is nothing else but a multiplication, condensation,
and detention of igneous parts, I prove also hence: Hold your hand at a certain
distance to a fire, at the first application of your hand, you will feel no
heat or warmth, but having held it there a little while, you shall begin to
feel warmth, and continuing your hand somewhat longer at the same distance, you
will feel heat: the reason is, because at your first application, the fire not
yet being sufficiently detained or condensed by your hand, you felt no warmth,
but after a certain condensation and gathering of the hot parts of the fire, it
begins to move and stir the ayry parts contained within the pores of your hand,
and after a further condensation, it makes force, and penetrates through the
ayry parts of the hand. Hence when you feel a pricking pain, then you cry it
burns; this pricking is nothing else, but the passing of the fire through the
ayry parts, and dividing it in Points and Pricks. The reason, why it does force
so through your hand, is because the ayry parts of it does condense the parts
of the fire. So that according to the multiplication, condensation and
detention of the fire, warmth becomes hot; hot, scorching hot; scorching hot,
blistering hot; blistering hot, burning, and burning hot becomes lastly to be
consuming hot; and these are all the degrees of condensation of fire.

V. I shall not think my labor lost, if I propose a way, whereby to balance
and know the force of fire, and to distinguish exactly what fire gives the
greatest heat. In my Road let me tell you, that balancing is a way, whereby to
know and compute the force of a thing. The balancing of weighty bodies, as of
earth, earthy and waterish bodies, they call weighing, because it is the trying
of the force of weight, that is, how much stronger one thing moves to the
Center then another. Upon the same ground one may as justly term the balancing
of light bodies, as of fire and air, lighting, which is the measuring of the
force of bodies from the Center.

Cause a pair of Scales to be made of a thin light matter, as of beaten Tin, or
the like, and overlay their convexe parts with a mixture of whites of Eggs and
Allom; then invert the convexe parts inwards, and the gibbous outward, and
place one Scale over the fire, so as its flame may perpendicularly strike into
it, which after a while hanging over the fire, will be forced upward by the
light parts of the fire; then put as much weight upon it, as Grains, Scruples,
or Drams, as will reduce the Scales to a balance, which after a greater
condensation or appulse of new parts, will force the Scales * The Scales hung
perpendicular over the Fire A.

B The Scales inverted.

D Flatness upon the gibbous side of the Scale for to place the weights upon.

upwards again, which you are to depress again to the same equilibre by an
equal proportion of weight; so by this you may discover the purity of fire, and
guess what proportion of smoke there is to such a force of fire, besides many
other things worthy of your Observation. Moreover note, that the fire must be
kindled in a deep Pot or Furnace, because of gathering its parts.

From what has been discoursed upon a reason may be drawn, why fire, that is
inherent in the air, is not sensibly warm; namely, because it is not enough
condensed through the ambient Air.

VI. Now that you shall not conceit that what has been proposed is altogether
my own Notion, I will adduce the judgment of Plato upon this Particular, who
although hitting right upon many things, yet they were soon dashed out by the
Arrogance of the Peripateticks.

In the first place (says he in Timaeo) let us consider for what reason fire
is said to be hot, which we shall soon come to know, if we do but observe the
Division and separation made by it: That it is a certain sharpness and passion
is manifest almost to all; we must consider the subtility of its Angles, the
thinness of its sides, the smalness of its Particles, the swiftness of its
motion, through all which it is forcible and penetrating, and that which it
does swiftly meet, it always divides and dissipates: considering also the
generation of its figure, that dividing our bodies through no other nature, and
dividing it in small parts does induce that passion, which is justly called
Heat. Here you see Plato has hinted right at many things appertaining to the
Notion of Heat. He says, heat is a passion, that is (as I said before) that,
we call heat a certain sensation, induced by the division of fiery minims.

2. You may observe, that his opinion asserts heat to be a quality migrating
out of fire into the body, which it heateth; but that it heateth by dividing
and penetrating through the diffusion of its small parts.

Scaliger Exerc. 12. d. 3. maintains the heat, which is in red hot Copper, not
to be a quality raised in it by the fire, but to be fire in substance contained
and condensed between its Pores.

Arist. Lib. 2. de gener. Cap. 2. describes heat to be that, which congregates
such bodies, as are of one Genus: For (says he) to segregate (which is that
which they say fire does) is to congregate congenited bodies, and such as are
of the same Genus: for it is accidental that it removes strange bodies. His
Followers propose the same in other words, viz. Heat is a quality, through
which homgeneous bodies are congregated, and heterogeneous disgregated.

I object against this, that fire is hot; but fire does through liquation mix
Brass and Silver together, Grease and Oil, Wine and Water, etc. But these are
not bodies of one nature; Wherefore fire does not always disgregate
heterogeneous bodies.

2. The heat of a Potters Oven congregateth Air, Water and Earth together; but
Air, Water and Earth are heterogeneous Bodies; Ergo.

3. If heat congregates homogeneous Bodies, then the hotter a thing is, the
more it must congregate homogeneous Bodies: but the Consequence is false, and
therefore the Antecedence is false also. The falsity of the Consequence
appears hence, that if the body of man be hotter then its temperamentum ad
justitiam requires, then it gathers and breeds heterogeneous humors in the
Blood, as Choler, and adust Melancholy.

4. The heat of the Sun raises mud and other heterogeneous bodies in the bottom
of waters, and causes them to congregate and unite with the body of the same
waters.

5. Some of his Sectators demonstrate the reality of this effect of fire, in
that it congregates Gold through liquation, and so separates Silver and other
Metals from it.

To this I answer, that the same heat having exactly mixed them before, can as
well, if intended, reunite them again, as it has separated them. Neither is
this separation any other but per accidens, although the union is per se. I
prove it, It is true, at the first melting there is a kind of Separation of
Silver from Gold, and of Lead from Silver: but this befalls accidentally
only; for the Silver is separated from Gold, and Silver from Lead, because
Silver being melted before Gold, and Lead before Silver, and the Gold remaining
as yet unmelted, and silver also after the Liquation of Lead, they must of
necessity sink down through the first melted parts of Silver and Lead, as being
yet unmelted: for Silver, which is contained within the body of Gold, will be
melted and attenuated within its body, before the Gold it self is scarce
mollified, whose parts being now mollified, through their dense weight squeeze
the Silver out of their Pores. Wherefore this separation is effected by the
fire per accidens; but augment your heat to such a degree as to melt your Gold,
then cast some more Silver to it, and see whether they will not mix. I believe
you will find it so. Lastly, This is not a Description of heat, but the
mentioning of one of its Effects; for heat formally is another thing.

VII. The Second quality per Accidens of earth is, a punctual violent
compression to the Center. As the earth does meet the fire in its first
quality, so it does also in its second. Earth when it is violently detained
from its Center, it does punctually compress that body, which does detain it,
toward its Center. If you take up a handful of Sand from the ground, does it
not compress your hand downwards?

Likewise the pressing downwards in all bodies proceeds from the detention of
earth in their bodies. Observe; cast earth upon earth and it will hardly
compress its parts any more then it was compressed before; but a stone, or
other mixed heavy body lying upon the ground presses a hole into the ground;
yet if as much more earth, as there is contained in such a stone, were cast
upon the same place, it would not make any sensible cavity or Impression: the
reason is, because in a stone or mixed body the earth is violently detained, and
therefore uses the greater force or compression to the Center: but earth being
in its natural seat does not. This quality may be called coldness, supposing it
to be a passion wrought upon the tact by the earth punctually pressing to the
Center: In this sense coldness is an absolute quality; in another it may be
taken for a privation of heat, because it seizes upon the tact only in the
absence of heat.

According to the former sense does the Poet elegantly explain the nature of
Cold. -- Nam penetrabile frigus adurit.


For the penetrating cold does burn. By penetrating, its compression is
intended. That the cold is penetrating and pressing, none that ever has been
in Greenland will deny, wherefore in that it is an absolute quality. In the
latter sense it may be taken for a privation: for it is the absence of heat,
which effects Coldness, yet not per se, but per accidens, because as long as
the heat is in a body, it does through its motion ad extra, balance and temper
the motion of cold ad iutra; but the heat being departed, then coldness does
through its compression punctually divide the continuous parts of the body, as
the ayry and waterish parts of it, and so coldness is reduced to action through
the defect of heat to balance it. This we are sensible of in the Winter, at
which time there being a detraction of the ambient heat, the earthy parts
contained in the Air, do then through their weight press down upon us, and
being arrived to our skin, they repel the heat, which being repelled, they join
with the earthy parts of our Body, and so cause a greater punctual compression;
whence we soon feel a dense acuteness, thence an asperity, and thence a
hardness or rigidity. When again we approach the fire, then its heat joins
with our internal heat, and expelling the extrinsick cold parts, it does force
the intrinsic ones back to the Circumference, and so we grow hot again.

VIII. There is also a Compression observeable in water, but much different
from that caused by earth, water compressing the tact with a continuation, and
not punctually, and therefore the compression made by water is equal, thick and
obtuse; whence it is, that when we have newly washed our hands with cold water,
we feel a thick levor upon them, caused by the continuous pressure of the
water. The division, which produces this cold passion in our tact, is not by
separating or disjoyning its continuous parts, but by squeezing the Air
contained within its pores, which being squeezed, impelleth also the fiery
spirits seated about these Pores; from which impulsion we feel a punctual and
acute division, so that the passion raised by water does per se only compress
obtusely the continuous parts of our tact through a squeezing, and per accidens
it disuniteth them punctually by impelling the fiery spirits effentially
inhering in the said tangent parts; besides, water containing some earthy
points, does by reason of them excite withal a small acute compression.

Arist. Lib. 2. de ort. anim. Cap. 4. and in Lib. 1. de Meteor. Cap. 4. seems
to assert, that coldness is nothing else but a privation of heat: For (says
he) the two Elements (implying water and earth) remain cold by reason of the
defect of circular motion making heat.

Zabarel, Lib. 2. de qual. Elem. cap. 3. makes good my Opinion, although by
guess: or at least we must say that coldness is really in it self a positive
quality (but wherein this positive quality consists, he knows not;) but
that it arises from a privation of heat, and in respect of heat it may take
place among privations. This tends to the same purpose as I have stated before,
namely, that coldness cannot act, unless heat be absent in such a proportion,
as that it may have power over it. The same is appliable to heat and the other
qualities, viz. that they are privations, in regard they cannot act without the
absence of their Opposites, but that they are positive, because they act
sensibly in the absence of the said opposites.

But what shall I think of Aristotle, who has soon altered his opinion in Lib.
2. de Ort. and Inter. Text. 9. Cold is, that does equally conjoyn and
congregate bodies, that are of the same Gender, as well as those of a differing
Gender. A plain Contradiction; for that, which does conjoyn and congregate
bodies by condensation, must be positive, according to his own words: yet
nevertheless above he asserted it to be a Privation. I wave this, and proceed
in making disquisition upon his Definition; Broth, as long as it remains
boiling hot, the fat of it is contained within it, being exactly mixed with the
water; but as soon as it cooles, it is separated and cast forth to the top; ergo
cold does segregate heterogenea from homogenea. Earth separates her self from
water, and water segregates her parts from fire and air; but water and earth
are cold, and yet do not congregate their own parts with others of another
gender; Ergo.

2. This is no more but the mentioning of one of its remote effects; for they
themselves grant that it produces this effect through condensation; ergo cold
is not formally defined, but described through one of its effects.

It now proves easy to us to decide that inveterated dispute concerning the
primum frigidum. That, which does most divide the tact by compression, is the
primum frigidum, or the coldest; but the earth does most compress our tact or
tangent parts; for it does compress the tact acutely, and water obtusely only;
ergo it is the coldest.

2. According to their own Tenants; that, which does most condense, is the
coldest, but earth condenses most; for it condensates her own parts into Metals
and Stones; but water, although it incrassates, yet it cannot condense bodies
into that consistence which earth does; ergo.

3. That, which is heaviest, is the coldest; for condensation is an effect of
weight; but earth is heaviest; ergo.

Lastly, If it be your pleasure to name Earth a frigidum in summo, and Water a
frigidum in remisso; Fire a calidum in summo sive intenso, and Air calidum in
remisso, you may without Offense.

CHAP. XVI. Of the remaining Respective Qualities of the Elements.
1. The Second Respective Quality of the Air. That water cannot be really and
essentially attenuated. The State of the Controversy. 2. That Air cannot be
really and essentially incrassated. Why a man whilst he is alive sinkes down
into the water and is drowned, and afterward is cast up again. That a woman is
longer in sinking or drowning then a man. The great error committed in trying
of Witches by casting them into the water. 3. That a greater Condensation or
Rarefaction is impossible in the Earth. 4. In what sense the Author understands
and intends Rarefaction and Condensation throughout his Philosophy. 5. The
third Respective quality of Fire. What Dryness is. The Definition of Moisture.
The third respective qualities of Water and Air. Aristotle's Description of
Moisture rejected. That water is the primum humidum. In what sense Air is
termed dry, in what moist.


1. THe Second Respective quality of Air is a continuous expression toward the
Circumference, as we see in water, viz. in bubbles, within whose body air being
contained does express the water to the Circumference. When water is thus
expressed to the Circumference, we say then, it is water attenuated or
rarefied, and when air is contained within the body of water, so as it is not
strong enough to come forth, we say it is air incrassated: but these are no
real transmutations. For can any body imagine that air is really and
essentially incrassated or condensed, as they call it, or that water is
attenuated, or essentially changed into a thin substance by air? I prove that a
real incrassation of the air is impossible. Peripatecicks generally conceive
the incrassation of the air to happen, when that air having thinly or naturally
filled up a cavity, there is as much more impacted in that cavity upon the
preceding air, as the cavity contained before: Through this impaction the
former air must needs give way into it self for to admit that air, which is
last entered; wherefore, say they, there must be a penetration of bodies,
whereby that former air does introcede into it self. The air then thus
introceding into it self, is called air incrassated. Water is attenuated when a
Pint of water is diducted to a Pint and a quarter, or more, without being
insufflated by the air or any other admitted body. So rarefaction of earth is,
when the earth possessing the space of a Pistol Bullet, is diducted to the
extent of space of a Musket Bullet without the admission of any other Element.
Fire is supposed to be condensed in the same manner as Air is incrassated. This
is the true and evident state of the Controversy touching Rarefaction and
Condensation, Attenuation and Incrassation; which never any among the
Peripateticks did yet truly state. They supposing and taking it for granted,
that such a Condensation and Rarefaction, Artenuation and Incrassation is
possible, and happens every moment, do proceed in debating, whether a
penetration of bodies be not necessary in Rarefaction and Condensation. As for
insufflation, that is not to be called in question, because we stated
Incrassation and Rarefaction to happen without the admittance of any other
body. Wherefore proving such an Incrassation and Attenuation to be impossible
and absurd, their further surmising of penetration will seem ridiculous.
Supposing that a Glass were filled with pure water, all the Arts of the world
could not distend it without the admission of another body, through the force
of which, its parts might be divided and lifted up: Since then that water is
said to be attenuated, because its parts are lifted up and diducted through Air
and Fire retained with their body, this cannot be a natural and proper
attenuation of the real parts of water, but only a violent diduction of water
through the air which is under it.

Here may be objected, That water, when it is thus lifted up and expanded, is
stretched, and through that stretching its parts are attenuated, and its
quantity is increased; because after the retching it possesses a larger place.

To this I Answer, that the increase of quantity about the Surface is not
through a single extent of water without access of other parts of water to it,
but the increase is from the access of those parts, which did possess the
Center, and now are beaten away and impelled to the Surface, where arriving
they must be extended in greater quantity, and possess a larger place. So that,
what is increased in the Surface is decreased from the Center, and its adjacent
parts. A Chord of an Instrument is producted in length, because it is
diminished in thickness, and not from a mere quality without the Access of
other parts.

2. Were the natural thickness of water transmutable into thinness, then one
extreme contrary would be transmutable into the other; for thinness and
thickness are as much contrary as coldness and heat, or dryness and moisture;
and who ever knew the same coldness changed into heat, or the same heat into
coldness? That would be, as if one said, one and the same was both cold and hot
at the same time. I guess your Reply, to wit, that through Thinness is not
meant an extreme Thinness, but a less Thickness only. I answer, That if a thick
Element is transmutable into a less thick, then certainly through the
continuance and intention of the cause of that less thickning, it might become
least thick, that is, most thin: wherefore your Reply is invalid.

3. Were thickness transmutable into thinness, then every rarefaction would be
a creation secundi modi, or a new generation; because such a transmutation is a
non esse, vel a nihilo sui ad esse aliquid: for thickness is a positive (if I
may be suffered to term it so) privation and negation of thinness; because when
we affirm a thing to be thick, it is the same as if we said it is not thin.

4. Thickness is a property quarti modi of water, but a proprium quarti modi is
inseparable from its Subject, and that to remain in being.

II. The same Arguments prove the impossibility of incrassating Air, and such a
supposition is so far absurd, that it is impossible and contradictory to
Nature, that one Minimum more of Air should enter into a Cavity already filled
up with it; and the air would sooner break the world then admit incrassation,
although but in one Minimum. If the nature of air is to be thin, then in taking
away tenuity, you take away the nature of Air. And if air could be incrassated
in one minimum, it might be incrassated to the thickness of water. Lastly, was
there any such incrassation, there must of necessity a penetration of bodies be
allowed; but a penetration is impossible: ergo Incrassation also. I prove that
a penetration is impossible: Suppose a hundred minima's of air were through
penetration incrassated to fifty, and these fifty to possess but half the place
which the hundred did fill up: I conclude then, that through continuance and
intention of the same incrassating cause they could be reduced to one minimum;
and from one minimum to the essence of a spirit or to nothing; for since they
through penetration have lost the space of Ninety nine unities of points,
through the same reason they might the easier lose the last unity, and so
become spirits and thence nothing; if there was a penetration of bodies, then
the less body, into which the greater quantity is penetrated, must have the
greater weight, or as great as it was under the greater quantity, or else part
of its Matter and Form must be annihilated; but bodies, that are incrassated or
condensed have by much a less weight then they had before, because the light
elements, which did before distend their bodies, and through that distention
their force of weight was intended (as I have showed before) are departed.
Besides Experience speaks the same, especially in this Instance, the true
reason of which was never laid down by any: a man yet living, or any other
creature when alive, is much heavier, then when he is dead; and this appears
in a man, who whilst he was alive sinks toward the bottom into the water and
is drowned; the reason is, because through the great heat, which was inherent
in that man, the heavy and terrestial parts were the more detained from the
Center; they again being thus detained, moved stronger toward the center, and
therefore make the body heavier during their violent detention through the great
heat, which was in the said man when alive; so that through this great weight
the alive body sinkes down to the bottom: now when a man is suffocated, and the
heat squeezed out of him by the thick compressing parts of the water, then he
is rendered less heavy, and immediately leaves the inferior parts of water, as
being less weighty then the said profound parts. Nevertheless although the
vital flame was soon extinguished, yet there remain ayry and some fiery parts in
man, which detain the earthy and waterish parts of his body; so that although
the vital fire is expelled, yet these ayry and restant fiery parts not being
overcome before a certain term of days, in some sooner or longer, occasion
that a man does not grow lighter then the water before a prefixed time varying
according to the proportion and texture of the light elements; and then being
grown lighter then the water, he swimmeth atop. Every day after a man is
drowned, as the heat and ayry parts are expelled, he is more and more elevated
from the ground, until he comes to the top. A strong compact well set man is
at least 8 or 9 days in ascending, because his heat was deeper, and in greater
quantity impacted into his body; but therefore sinkes sooner to the bottom, as
I have heard Seamen relate, how that some of their men falling overboard, were
gone under water in the twinkling of an eye, but then they were big, lusty
strong men, as they told me. On the contrary we hear, how that weak and tender
women have fallen into the River, and have swom upon the water until watermen
have rowed to them and taken them up (and many weakly women that were suspected
to be Witches, being cast into the water for a trial have been wickedly and
wrongfully adjudged to be Witches, because they were long in sinking, and alas
it is natural) the reason was, because they were comparatively light: for their
earthy parts were not so much detained, and consequently moved not so forcibly
downwards, no doubt but their Coats conduced also somewhat to it. Whence I
collect that an ordinary woman is almost one third longer descending to the
bottom then an ordinary man, because a man from being a third stronger (because
he is a third heavier through the force of the light Elements, but I mean not
through fat or corpulency) then a woman, is conjectured to have one third more
heat then a woman. In case a man or woman is drowned in the Sea where it is
deep, if he be suffocated and dead before he comes to the ground, he will not
reach the bottom. But to make this more clear, I will demonstrate it through
another Principle, viz. the lightness of fire, and air; which is, whereby they
spread themselves equally from the Center to the Circumference. Now, that great
heat burning within the body of man does potently press down all the heavy
parts of the body toward the Circumference. The ambient or external parts of
man are the Circumference, which being so vigorously pressed, must needs be
very much intended in their motion downwards: hence it is, that, when a man is
in sinking, he feels a pressing within his own body, whereby he finds himself
to be violently (as it were) precipitated to the bottom: and add to this the
violent detention of the weighty parts, and the depression of the superficial
parts of the water, and judge whether all this is not enough to draw him down
to the bottom.

Pray now judge a little at the simplicity of the reason which the
Peripateticks give for this: They say that there is a fight between man's heat
and the water, and therefore the water draws him to her innermost part, where
she detaines him until his heat is overcome, and then the water casts him up
again: Others say, that man's Lungs being filled with air underneath after he is
drowned, is lifted up by it. What groapings and absurdities?

First, They suppose that the water draws, and that the fight is between the
heat of man and the moisture; whereas the water does not draw, neither is the
fight so much between the water and heat, as it is between the heat and earthy
parts of the body, which with the natural declination of those terrestrial
parts, and the assistance of the water from without does depress a man or other
living creature downwards.

2. Why a man is detained such a time and no longer or shorter before he is
cast up again, they cannot conceive.

3. How man is cast up is unknown to them: it is not, because his Lungs are
filled with Air; for it is more probable they are stopped up with water.

The reason and manner of his being cast upwards is,

1. His body is rendered less weighty by the expulsion of the heat.

2. His body is retcht out and diducted through the coldness of earth and
especially of the water, and therefore is rendered lighter, for as compression
and condensation is a mark of weight, so diduction and extension of lightness.
Wherefore every particle of water being thicker and heavier then the extended
body does depress underneath it toward its center, and so much the more,
because the dead body does as it were detain the parts of water about it from
their center: and so through this depression of the water under the Corpse, it
is lifted up by little and little: Besides, it is somewhat puffed up with winds
and vapors underneath the water, which thence do lift it up toward the
Element of Air.

The reason why a Dog, Cat, Hare, Fox, Horse and other living Creatures, are
longer in being drowned, although they have more heat inherent in them, and as
much earth comparatively as a man, is because their hairs being light, close
and divided, do sustain them: for the water being continuous, does strive
against its being divided by contiguous parts, which being light, strive also
against their depression. This by the way.

III. Neither is the earth subject to such a Rarefaction, or greater
Condensation, because it consists (as I have proved) out of indivisible
minima's. If then we should grant a rarefaction or greater condensation, we
must allow the minima's of earth to be divisible: for how could they either be
retcht or give way into themselves else? and so it would be divisible and
indivisible at once, which is absurd. The same Argument serves against the
condensation and rarefaction of fire: But more of this in our Discourse de
vacuo.

IV. Condensation, Rarefaction, Attenuation and Incrassation although
impossible in this sense, yet in another, are usually received, and may be
allowed.

Condensation in a tolerable acception is, when a rare body is united to a
dense body, and because it is then (as it were) made one body with the dense
substance, it is said to be condensed. Thus when fire is united to earth, it is
said to be condensed, but through this condensation there is nothing detracted
from, or added to the natural rarity of the fire.

2. Condensation is also taken for the frequent and constant following of one
particle of fire upon the other. Now, you must not conceive, that the fire
hereby is condensed or impacted in its rarity; no, but that one part pusheth
the other forward, and being so pusht forward one before the other, they are
said to be condensed, that is following one another so close as that they just
come to touch one another. Thus we say that condensed fire warmeth or heateth
the hand, because many parts follow one another, and so push one another
forward into the substance of the hand; so that condensation of fire in this
sense is nothing else but an approximation of the parts of fire that were
dispersed before.

2. Fire burns the hand, when its parts being condensed according to both
these two acceptions are received and collected, following close upon one
another, and so do burn the hand. The reason is, because as the force of earth
and water is intended by violent detention, so is fire, which being violently
detained by earth and water, does move with greater force. Besides through the
latter of these condensations, the parts of fire are more collected and united.
The fire is violently detained, when it is detained from moving from the Center
to the Circumference. Besides, according to these two latter acceptions, you
are to understand condensation above, whereas I have attributed it to fire.

A body is said to be rarefied, when it is affixed to a rare element; thus they
conceive earth to be rarefied, when its minima's are diffused by a portion of
fire.

A body is attenuated, when it is united to a thin Element; so water is
attenuated, when its parts are diducted through the renuity of Air.

A body is said to be incrassated, when it is adjoined to a thick Element. Thus
Air is understood to be incrassated, when it is clothed about with water.

Remember that I have made use of these words in my foregoing Discourses
according to the said Interpretations.

V. The Third Relative Qualities are such as do immediately emanate from the
Second.

The third respective Quality of fire is Dryness. A Dryness is an expulsion of
Moisture, which fire does by forcing it to the Circumference, and dividing ad
extra its continuity.

Dryness in the earth is an effect of coldness, through which it divides ad
intra the continuity of moisture inwards, and forces it to the Center.

Moisture is an effect of water, through which it overlaies a body with its own
thick substance expanded: in air it is a quality, whereby it overlayes a body
with its thin substance.

Aristotle in stead of describing these qualities, he sets down one of their
Attributes. Moisture is that, which is difficultly contained within its own
bounds, and easily within others. This is openly false: for the air is
difficultly contained within the bounds of others, insomuch that it striveth to
break through with violence, and therefore is more easily contained within its
own bounds. So water is easier contained within its own bounds; for when it is
poured upon the earth, it vanishes presently, which is not a containing of it.
Besides granting this Attribute to them both, it is only a mark of Moisture,
and not the Description of its formality.

No doubt but water is moyster then air, because it is more apt to cleave
through its thickness, and adhere to a body then air, which by reason of its
tenuity is not so tenacious. Wherefore it is Idleness in th^se who say that the
air is moyster then water, although water moistneth more, because of its
thickness.

And as concerning the primum siccum, it belongs to the earth, because that
obtains greater force in detracting waterish moisture, which is the moystest.
That it does so, appears hence, because the waterish moisture through its
weight is more obedient to the impulse of earth then of fire. But if you agree
to term nothing moist but what has a palpable Dampness; and that drying, which
removes the said dampness, then water alone is moystning, and air drying,
because air through its tenuity divides the crassitude of the water, and so
disperseth it.

CHAP. XVII. Of Mixtion.
1. What Mixtion is. Three Conditions required in a Mixtion. 2. Whether Mixtion
and the generation of a mixed body differ really. 3. Aristotle's Definition of
Mixtion examined. Whether the Elements remain entire in mixed Bodies. 4. That
there is no such Intension or Remission of Qualities as the Peripateticks do
apprehend. The Authors sense of Remission and Intention. 5. That a Mixtion is
erroneously divided into a perfect and imperfect Mixtion.


HItherto we have sufficiently declared the absolute and respective Qualities
of the Elements: That which I must next apply my self unto, is to enarrate the
qualities befalling them jointly in their union one with the other.

I. Their union is called Mixtion, which is an union of the Elements in
Minima's or Points, Observe that mixtion sometimes is taken for the union of
parts, not in points, but particles, and is termed Union by Apposition; as when
you mix Barley and Oats together into one heap.

Anaxagoras, and many of the ancient Philosophers did opiniate, that Mixtion
consisted only in the apposition of little parts to one body; but Aristotle
has justly reprehended them for this Assertion, and confuted their Opinion,
Lib. 2. de Genesis and Corrup. Cap. 10.

Properly Mixtion is effected through an exact confusion of parts, and their
union in Minima's, or the least particles: the exactness consists in this,
that there must be an equal measure (sive ad pondus, sive ad justitiam) of
parts. Parts are either little or great. The great are constituted out of
little, and the little out of the least.

In mixture (to wit, an equal one) are generally three condititions required:

1. A mutual contact, without which there must be a vacuum in (misto) a mixed
body.

2. This mutual contact must be in points, whereby every point of an Element
touches the minimum of another; hence they say well (mixtio fit per minima)
that mistion is caused through Minima's

3. A reaction of each of the elements, whereby the light Elements receive the
weighty ones, and the continuous the contiguous ones.

These three conditions are implied in my Definition by union in minima's; for
union cannot happen without a mutual contact: A mutual contact is attained unto
through the first qualities of the Elements, whereby they move one to the
other, and so there passes a mutual embrace or reaction between them.

II. Here the Peripateticks setting aside the reality of the thing, begin again
to move a notional question: whether mixtion and the generation of a mixed body
differ from one another. Doubtless there is no real difference between them;
for where the Elements are mixed, there the generation of a mixed body is
accomplishr, and where there is a generation of a mixed body, there is also a
mistion of the Elements. Wherefore it is a sound Definition, that mistion is
the generation of a mixed body out of the Elements.

Zabarel, I remember, makes an intentional difference between them, in
attributing mistion to the Elements alone, because mistion has a particular
respect to the Elements, as they are apprehended through this mixture to be the
termini a quo: but the generation of a mixed body has more a respect to the
terminus ad quem. This is simple; for since that mistion is by them counted a
motion, it must then equally have respect to the terminus a quo and the
terminus ad quem, because there is no natural motion, but it moves a quo, and
ad quem; and besides, do they not define Generation to be a mutation from non
esse to esse? Wherefore according to their own words, generation does equally
regard the terminus a quo and ad quem; ergo there is no distinctio rationis
between them. But they reply, that mixtion is not the mixture of a mixed body,
but of the Elements; and generation is not the generation of the Elements, but
of a mixed body. How sinisterly? This is not the question, but the doubt is,
whether by mixture a mixed body is not as much employed as the Elements: Yes, for
a mixture is the union of the Elements: By union understand a perduction of the
Elements into an unity, that is one body; and is not this the terminus ad quem?

III. Aristotle defines mistion to be an union of alterated miscibles (to wit,
bodies.) Here the word alterated is cast as a Bone among his Disciples, which
each of them falls a gnawing in interpreting it, and a knorring at it in
raising altercations and cavils about it. Alteration say they, is a mutual
action and passion of the Elements through their contrary qualities, through
which they obtund, hebetate, refract, immutate one another, and what not? And
not understanding the nature of obtusion, refraction or immutation, but
erroneously conceiving the forms of the Elements to be diminished (by reason
they think that the heat of the Elements is expelled, refracted and diminished
by cold; and so of the other Elements) they fall a quarrelling, whether the
forms of the Elements remain whole or entire in their mixtures. If any body now
should ask them, what they mean by form: they would reply, that it was the
first principle of motion in a body; and if you ask them further, what that
principle of motion is; they will tell you it is hidden; If it is hidden, I
wonder how they come to know it; ergo they tell you what a thing is, which they
do not know. But to the question, I affirm that the elements remain actually
and entire in their substantial forms in mixed bodies. I prove it, the
substantial form of a thing is inseparable from its matter, supposing the thing
to remain that which it was: for if a property is inseparable, much more is the
form: Besides the form gives a thing to be that which it is: But the elements
remain elements in a mixed body; because their qualities are sensible, not in
gradu remisso, in a remiss degree, but in an intense degree; Who ever doubted,
but that earth in Gold or Lead is as weighty, and more then it is in its own
Region? for being laid upon the earth it makes a Dent into it; ergo it is
heavier.

Questionless focal fire is hotter then fire in its own Region; Oil is moyster
then air or water, ergo according to their own Principles these qualities,
which they call first qualities, and are forced to acknowledge to be forms, are
inherent in the forementioned bodies in an intense degree. As for the
Refraction, Intention, Remission or Immutation of the Elements, which they take
their refuge unto in declaring the reasons of Mixtion, as to a Sanctuary, are
mere Notions, there being in reality no such intension or remission of the
Elements, unless through access or recess of new parts.

IV. But let us make a deeper search into this Nicety so much disputed upon by
all Ancient and Modern Philosophers: and that which makes me the more willing
to examine this scruple, is, because it has hitherto been one of my main
Principles, That an Element being violently detained is intended and
corroborated in its strength and power. This is the deepest and furthest doubt
that can be moved, it being concerning the most remote power, and first cause
of action in the Elements.

I have already taken away the difficulty touching Incrassation and
Attenuation, and showed, that the Matter of a thick Element was not really
attenuated in its own substance, or increased in matter, because it possessed a
larger place, although seemingly it was; wherefore I did assume the use of
those words but in an improper acception. In that place the question was about
the increase of matter; now it is concerning the increase or intention and
remission of Forms or Qualities, strengths and virtues of the Elements. The
same I said in relation to Condensation and Incrassation, I must apply to
Intention and Remission: that properly they are to be taken for a real
increment or decrement of qualities in themselves, without the detraction or
addition of new parts containing the same virtue; as if the same heat in the
third degree should be supposed capable of being intended to the fourth degree
without the additament of new heat. This is impossible, because of the same
reasons, which were given against the possibility of a proper and real
Condensation and Incrassation.

2. A quality may be said to be intended or remitted, but improperly and per
Accidens; as when a force or quality is accidentally intended (as by a more
convenient position) and yet the quality or force is neither more or less, but
the same it was: As for example, Take hold of a Hammer about the middle, and
strike with it with all your strength, and take hold again of the same Hammer
about the end, and strike although but with the same force, yet the last
impulse shall be stronger then the first: Here you see is an accidental
intension of force hapened through a more convenient position of your hands.

So water, when it is violently detained, is intended in its gravity: because
its expansion (which is a more convenient position) does intend its motion, and
yet the same strength and force of gravity was latent in the water, when it was
in its natural position. Water does always affect and covet a globous figure;
now through this globosity the water is rendered disadvantageous to exert its
weight, because all its parts cannot join together in opposing the body, which
it is to depress; but being in a Globe the undermost parts of that Globe do
partly sustain the force of the uppermost and centrical parts, and the same
undermost parts being interposed between the other body, and the other parts,
cause that the others parts cannot come at the body. That this is so, the trial
of this Experiment will soon certify you; weigh some long pieces of Iron or
Wood in a payr of Scales, and observe the weight of them; then divide them into
less pieces, so as they may lie closer, and weigh them again, you will find
that the last shall be much lighter then the first; besides I have tried it
many other ways. This Reason will also serve to illustrate the manner of
intention of weight in earth, when it is violently detained.

Air moves stronger upwards, when its parts are more divided and expanded; for
then every particle of the air contributes its motion; and so in fire.
Nevertheless the same force was actually in the air and fire below: In this
sense it is I have made use of Intention of Qualities above in the Precedent
Chapter.

Wherefore it appears hence, that there is no such refraction or intention of
qualities, as the Peripateticks imagine to themselves.

V. A mixed body is usually divided into a body perfectly mixed, and a body
imperfectly mixed, and as usually received among the Vulgar; but whether this
Division be lawful is doubted by few. An imperfectly mixed body they describe
to be a body, whose mixture is constituted only by two or three elements; a
great error, there being no body in the world, excepting the elements
themselves, but their mistion consists of four Ingredients. This I have
proved before. Others think to mend the matter by saying, that an imperfect
mixed body consists of Ingredients but a little alterated, and therefore its
form is not different from the element, which predominates in it. To the
contrary, the Ingredients in imperfectly mixed bodies are as much alterated as
there is virtue in them to alterate one another: and who will not assert the
form of a Comet to be different from the form of fire, or Snow from the form of
water? etc. There is no mixed body, but it is perfectly mixed; for if it be
imperfectly mixed, it will not constitute a mixed body. It Is true, some mixed
bodies contain a fuller proportion of Elements then others, and therefore are
more durable, and may be of a more perfect proportion, yet the mixture of a
body, which lasts but a moment, is as much a mistion as that, which lasts
an age, and consequently as perfect in reference to mixture.

CHAP. XVIII. Of Temperament.
1. That Temperament is the form of Mixtion. That Temperament is a real and
positive quality. 2. The Definition of a Temperament. Whether a Temperament is
a single or manifold quality. Whether a complexion of qualities may be called
one compounded quality. 3. Whether a Temperament be a fifth quality. A
Contradiction among Physicians touching Temperament. Whether the congress of
the four qualities effects but one Temperament, or more. 4. That there is no
such thing as a Distemper. What a substantial Change is. 5. What an Altsration
or accidental change is. That the Differences of Temperament are as many as
there are Minima's of the Elements excepting four.


1. THe Form of Mistion is Temperament. I prove it. That must be the Form of
Mistion which does immediately result out of or with the union of the elements;
but a temperament does immediately result out of or with union of the Elements;
Ergo.

2. Since there is no deperdition or refraction of the absolute forms of the
Elements, that must needs be the form of Misture, which the union of those
absolute forms does immediately constitute: but that can be nothing else but a
Temperament; Ergo.

3. That is the form of Mistion, which chiefly causes all the operations and
effects produced by a mixed body; but the chief cause of all the operations and
effects of a mixed body is the temperament; ergo. The Minor is asserted by all
ingenious Physicians. Hence we may safely infer, that a temperament is not a
relative only, but a positive and real quality; for were it only a relation,
its essence would wholly depend from the mind, and be little different from an
Ens Rationis.

II. A Temperament is the union of the forms of the Elements. By union
apprehend the forms of the Elements united into one quality. The name of
temperament sounds a temperating or mixing, yet not primarily of Matters, but
principally of Forms; for none doubts of its being a quality, or formal power.

Kyper, in his Medic. contract. Lib. 1. Cap. 3. alleges this doubt, whether a
temperament be a simple or manifold quality: but before I apply my self to the
solution of it, observe that simple may either have respect to the Matter
(materia ex qua) out of which a temperament is constituted, which are the four
first qualities or forms of the Elements; or to the form of a temperament,
which is one quality resulting out of the union of its materials. Wherefore if
simple be taken in the former respect, doubtless a temperament is a manifold
quality; if in the latter, it is simple. I prove it: simple in the latter
respect is equipollent to unity: but a temperament is but one quality, and not
manifold; although out of many, yet united into one; ergo a temperament is a
simple quality.

2. Were a temperament formally a manifold quality, its effects would be
equivocal and manifold; but to the contrary the effects per se of a temperament
are univocal and simple, the one not differing in specie from the other.

The said Kyper proposes the very words of my Solution for a doubt in the next
Paragraph: whether complexion of qualities may be called one compounded
quality: which he determines very well: In Metaphysics (says he) there is not
only allowed of an unity of simplicity, but also of an unity of composition;
wherefore it is not repugnant, that there should be an unum compositum of
qualities, since there is an unum compositum of substances.

III. This puts me in remembrance of another controversy, which I have
formerly read in Market. his works, Lib. 1. Part 2. de Elem. Class. 2. Quaest.
39. whether a temperament be a fifth quality, or rather a Concord or Harmony of
the four Elements? Avicen defines it a fifth quality, to which the said Author
subscribes; but Fr. Vallesius, Lib. 1. Cap. 6. contra Med. and Phys. Fernel.
and others oppose it. To decide a Controversy agitated by the greatest of
Philosophers and Physicians, needs a deep inspection: Wherefore I demand what
they understand by a fifth quality? whether a quality really, or modally only
differing from the four single qualities of the Elements?

2. Whether the Authors of the contrary opinion intend by Harmony or Concord
any thing distinct from the single qualities of the Elements? There is none I
find answers to this; which compels me to handle the Question, in supposing
the one party to mean by a fifth quality, a quality really distinct, and the
other by Harmony of the Elements, to intend nothing distinct from the elements
being united in a proportion.

A temperament is not a fifth quality really distinct from the qualities of the
elements; because a temperament cannot exist without the four qualities of the
elements; for take away but one of those qualities, and you take away the
temperament.

A temperament formally is not a Harmony or Concord only, because a Harmony or
Agreement of the four qualities is an Accident or condition following or
attending the union of qualities: Wherefore a harmony of the said qualities is
an Accident or Mode differing modally from a temperament; for when we conceive
a temperament, we do not conceive a harmony, although we conceive a harmony to
be a conditio sine qua non of a temperament; because without it they could not
be united.

A temperament is not a proportion of the Elements, but the union of the
Elements in a proportion.

A temperament is a fifth quality modally distinct from the elementary single
qualities, but not really; for a temperament is the union of four qualities in
one; wherefore this one quality is the same really with the four united,
although modally different.

2. A totum is modally only, and not really distinguished from its parts united;
but a temperament is a totum, and the qualities united are the parts united;
Ergo.

I cannot but strange at many Physicians, defining a temperament to be a
harmony, and yet asserting the first qualities to be contrary. A Contradiction:
For if the first qualities be contrary, they expel one another out of the same
Subject, but if they are harmonical, they will embrace and preserve one another
in their beings, which that they do, is abundantly demonstrated above.

Others again assert, that a temperament does include an union, not only of the
first qualities, but also of the substances of the elements. A Dullness! Wherein
would a temperament then differ from Mistion? Had they affirmed that mistion
did imply or include a temperament, it would have been an Heroic Saying not to
be expected from them.

Whether from the congress of the four qualities there result two temperaments,
one out of the active qualities, the other of the passive, is a further doubt
objected by them.

In the first place, they are deceived in distinguishing the first qualities
into active and passive qualities; because among them the one is no more active
or passive then the other, they being equally active and passive.

2. It is a contradiction to define a temperament to be the four qualities
united into one harmony, and afterward to conceive one harmony to be two, that
is, two temperaments.

IV. Properly and absolutely there is no distemperament, or intemperies,
because the form of every mixed body is a temperament: Wherefore a
distemperament sounds nothing else but a non-temperament, and consequently
there is no distemper. I confess a mutation or change of the proportion of the
Elements there may happen in a mixed body, yet notwithstanding that change the
temperament remains a temperament. If then you intend by an Intemperies
nothing but such a change, it may be defined to be the alteration of the form
of a mixed being. Alteration is the intention or remission of one or more of the
virtues, powers or forms of the Elements as they are temperated. Intension and
Remission take in the senses formerly set down.

Although in a strict sense every intention or remission of a first quality in
a mixed body changes the Form of it, yet because that every change is not
durable, but many are soon expelled again, through which a mixed body returns
to its former form; wherefore such changes are only counted substantial
changes, or mutations, whereby a body is so much changed, that it is
irreducible to its pristine Form, and whereby it produces Accidents altogether
sensibly differing from those, that were produced by its foregoing Form: for
example, when the temperament of a man is so much subverted and changed by the
appulse of another temperament, that it is rendered incapable of reduction to
its former temperament or form, and the accidents produced by it are altogether
sensibly differing from those that were produced by the foregoing temperament;
as when a man's Heat is subverted by the appulse of Cold, so as he is deprived
thereby of Life, Sense and Motion, then his form is changed into the form of a
(Cadaver) dead Corpse: because now other accidents are produced, being
altogether sensibly different from the former, and the lost Accidents are
irreducible. This is a substantial change or mutation, because the entire
essence of the thing is changed.

V. An Accidental change or Alteration is, when the temperament of a body is so
far changed, as that its Modes or Accidents appear to be sensibly changed, yet
not totally, but partially, and when the change is gone no further then it is
expulsible, and the former temperament reducible. I said sensibly changed,
because it is not every insensible increase or decrease of any of the first
qualities of a mixed body, deserves the name of Alteration, although in a large
sense it does. It will not be amiss to give you an Instance: A man when he is
feverish, is alterated, because fire is intended more then it was in his
precedent temperament, which therefore produces a sensible burning, pains and
weaknesses; but since his old temperament is reducible, it is only to be
counted an Alteration, or Accidental Change. Another distinction between a
substantial change, and an Alteration is, that a body by a substantial mutation
is so much changed, as that you do not know it to be the same thing it was: but
an alterated body, although it is somewhat changed, yet it is not so much
changed, but that you may know what it was.

If there be any Infinitum in the world, none is liker to be it then the number
of temperaments; for there are as many temperaments possible, as there are
Elementary Indivisibles, excepting four, to which one indivisible being added,
changes the temperament, and again another and another (and so on, until all
the indivisible be apposed) admitted to that changes the temperament again and
again.

CHAP. XIX. Of the Division of Temperaments.
1. What an equal and unequal Temperament is. That there never was but one
temperament ad pondus. That Adams Body was not tempered ad pondus. That neither
Gold nor any Celestial bodies are tempered ad pondus. 2. That all Temperaments
ad Justitiam are constantly in changing. That there are no two bodies in the
world exactly agreeing to one another in temperature. 3. The Latitude of
Temperaments. How the corruption of one body ever proves the generation of
another. 4. That there is no such unequal temperament as is vulgarly imagined.
That there is an equal temperament is proved against the vulgar opinion. That
where Forms are equal, their matters must also be equal. 5. What a Distemper
is. What Galen intended by an unequal temperature. 6. When a man may be termed
temperate. What bodies are said to be intemperate. 7. The combination of the
second Qualities of the Elements in a temperature. Their Effects.


I. A Temperament is divided into an equal temperament or a temperamentum ad
pondus, or unequal, otherwise called by Philosophers a temperamentum ad
justitiam.

An equal temperament is constituted out of an equal proportion of the forms of
the Elements; and therefore it is called a temperamentum ad pondus, because it
is so equally tempered, that if it were weighed, one Element would not
over-balance the other. This Temperament consists of an Arithmetical
proportion: It is otherwise called an anatick temperament.

An unequal temperament is, where the elementary forms are united in an unequal
proportion. It is called temperamentum ad justitiam, because there is just such
a proportion of the forms of the Elements as to fit it to act such an act, or
to exercise such Offices. The proportion observeable in this temperament is a
Geometrical proportion, whereby one Element overtops the other, or is elevated
above the other in such a degree or measure, as to produce such certain effects.

Nature never appeared in more then in one temperament ad pondus, but ever
after in temperaments ad justitiam, as I have showed a little before.

I have proved that the Chaos was the only temperament ad pondus, which its
nature and end did require; thereby it was rendered capable of existing in a
(vacuum) void space, and needed no external place to contain it, because it
contained it self.

The body of Adam in his Innocence was not temperated ad pondus, because it
would have rendered him immovable; for the Elements being supposed to be in an
equal proportion, and counterpoysing one another, local motion must have been
impossible.

Celestial bodies, although of so long a duration, or Gold (whatever Alchymists
say to the contrary) are neither tempered ad pondus, because the one could then
not be heavy, or the others light.

II. Since that a temperament ad justitiam ever obtaines one Element, or two,
or three, predominating over the others, its force being greater then the
others, does by that means free it self daily from their detention, by which a
temperament is constantly in changing, increasing in one, and decreasing in
another quality: this experience tells us, viz. that every being after its first
production in a sensible time undergoeth a sensible change of its Temperament,
and consequently undergoeth an insensible change of temperature in an
unsensible time, in such a manner that there is no body but does at least
change every minute of time in the detraction of a Minimum. Hence we are
supplied with a reason, why there are not two bodies to be found exactly like
unto one another in temperament, because bodies are always a changing.

You may object, That many substances produce effects diametrically like to one
another; ergo their temperament must be alike withal.

I deny the Antecedence; for although their Effects are alike according to
their appearance to our senses, notwithstanding Reason persuades us, that there
must be an insensible dissimilitude between their temperaments, and
consequently between their Effects.

III. The degrees of Changes, or Latitude of Temperaments in bodies are these;

1. There is an insensible change or alteration, which our senses cannot
discern; but it is only discoverable through Reason.

2. The second degree is a sensible alteration, which is evidently discernable
by sense, in that its effects are sensibly different, yet they must not be so
far deviated from the wonted preceding effects, as to be judged entirely unlike
to them.

3. A total change and mutation of Form, to the reception of which the two
forementioned alterations are previous dispositions. This degree of change in
respect to the expulsion of the preceding form is taken for a Corruption; in
regard of the subsequent form it is accounted a Generation. Hence derives this
Maxim, Generatiounius est corruption alterius: and vice versa. The Generation,
of one is the corruption of another. I cannot resemble the expulsion of a form
out of a body, and a reception of another into the same subject, to a better
example, then to a Ship in sight to one standing on the Pierhead at Dover, but
out of sight to those that are at Calice, whither the Ship is bound; now the
further this Ship sails, the more it appears in sight to them at Calice; and
the less to the others at Dover, until it is come quite into sight to them at
Calice, and then it is quite gone out of sight from the others. Even so it is
in alteration; for as the Ship fore-instanced grows insensibly less, and
recedes from one Coast to another; so an alteration likewise is insensible. But
after a sensible time the ship appears sensibly less, and more remote, so after
a sensible time an Alteration grows sensible, and as the Ship at last after
these insensible and sensible diminutions, and recesses, is suddenly quite gone
out of sight and vanished, so a mix body after all these insensible and
sensible alterations is suddenly changed into another form and become another
substance, the former being vanished.

The same is observeable in man, who altering insensibly every day in his
temperament, draws nearer and nearer to his Bed of rest, and after some years
expiration, finds sensibly that he is altered in his temperament, both which
alterations dispose him to his last sudden change and substantial mutation.

Galens delineation of the Latitude of temperaments does tend to the
confirmation of what I have proposed: Lib. 1. de Temper. he writes thus, If a
quality is exuperant, it becomes an Intemperies; if it be yet more augmented,
it turns to a Disease; if it be most increased, it is Death, or a substantial
mutation.

IV. A Temperament is vulgarly likewise divided into equal, or a temperament ad
pondus; and unequal, or a temperament ad justitiam. They define an equal
temperament to be that, which is equally and exquisitely tempered: and an
unequal temperament to be that, which is unequally and inexquisitely mixed. If
this be their meaning of equal and unequal, then their division is illegal,
because a temperament ad justitiam is as exquisitely and equally mixed as a
temperament ad pondus: for Gold is tempered ad justitiam; but none will deny
that Gold is equally tempered in particles, although not in great pieces. That
it is equally tempered in Particles, its equal color, equal consistence of
body, equal weight, etc. do testify. Can any assert otherwise, but that man is
equally tempered in Particles? To the contrary, an unequal temperament is no
temperament, or in the least tending to the generation of a mixed body, but to
its corruption, as you shall read below.

Had they by an equal temperament implied an equal proportion of the Elements
equally mixed, then their Definition would have been beyond controuling.

But give me leave to make somewhat a further disquisition upon their
subtilities: Others state a twofold equal temperament.

1. When the elements concur in a mixed body in equal weights, and in equal mole
and bigness: This temperament (say they) may be better feigned, and if it be
found at any time, it does not abide long, but passes in a moment: their
Reasons are,

1. Because a mixed body would rest in no place; for if it rested upon the
earth, then the earth must predominate; if in the fire, then the sire must
predominate, etc.

2. Neither could it be moved; for if it moved downwards, the heavy elements
would prevail, if upwards, the light ones.

3. The most active quality would overcome and consume the others.

4. There can be no mistion unless some of the first qualities conquer, and
others be conquered.

2. When the elements concur with equal force, but not with equal mole, which
temperament may also be better conceived in our mind, then imagined to be real.

Those forementioned Arguments seem to disprove a possible real Temperament ad
pondus, but how depravately, I shall instantly discover.

1. I affirm that a Mixtum ad pondus would rest in its own internal place,
because it contains it self, neither does it stand in need of an external
place; for only mixta ad justitiam do necessarily require a place to rest in,
because they having one element prevailing over the others, which moves them to
the region of that element, whereof it self is a part, where being arrived, are
contained by that entire elementary body; which is called a place, because it
contains those bodies that are arrived to it.

2. Their second Argument only deducts a true inference from a true
supposition; for doubtless a body tempered ad pondus could not be moved to an
external place from any internal Principle, because none had so much prevalence
over the other as to move it. And for what they assert concerning the not
duration of a mixtum ad pondus, is erroneous; for an eval duration may be
proved by their own words: thus, that which contains no contrary principle of
motion in it self, is incorruptible, and consequently of an eval duration; but
according to their own words, such a body cannot be moved; ergo.

3. This Argument is drawn from a false supposition; for in a mixtum ad pondus
all qualities are equally active, wherefore it is incapable of dissolution or
being overcome.

4. The last Argument is absolutely false.

As to the latter part of their Distinction, it is grounded upon a supposition
not to be supposed, which is, that there should be a possibility of the
equality of qualities or force in a mixed body, and not of quantities. I prove
the contrary, viz. that where ever there is an equality of qualities, there
must also be an equality of matter. Suppose that to balance one minimum of
Earth, there needs a hundred times as many, or more minima's of fire, these
hundred minima's if they were deprived of their lightness or form, and that one
minimum of its gravity, the remaining matter of those hundred would be no more
then the matter of this one: Look below; for according to the Philosopher
himself it is the forma quantitativa that causes a quantum in Matter.

All temperaments in respect to the proportion of the ingreding Elements are
equal: but all temperaments in respect to the manner of mistion are not equal.
Wherefore according to the manner of Mistion a temperament is divisible into
equal and unequal. An equal temperament there is, whose parts are equally mixed
one with the other throughout their whole substance or subject: For example,
Suppose the same as before, that 100 minima's of fire were a sufficient number
to balance one minimum of earth, and that a thousand Centenaries or proportions
of fire were to be mixed with a thousand minima's of earth, now to make this an
equal temperament, there must between every hundredth minim of fire be
interposed one minim of earth, and so throughout their whole subject. But
supposing that in one particle of that substance there was admixt one minim of
earth between a hundred, and in another Particle but one between two or three
or four hundred, this would cause an inequal temperament.

An equal temperament is (simpliciter) called a temperament or temperature, and
its entire being is called a mistum temperatum, or a temperate mixed body.

V. An unequal temperament is called an Intemperies, or distemper, because it
is not equally tempered; Hence Galen writes, Lib. 2. Aphor. That an unequal
temperature causes a difficulty. By an unequal temperature questionless he
means an Intemperies, or Distemper. But the same Galen, Lib. de Intemper.
inequ. toward the latter end, seems to acknowledge an aequalis Intemperies, in
these words: But if all ones members are wholly (tota per tota) altered and
changed, they are immediately freed from their pain: they are then seated in a
difficult state. I distinguish an Intemperies into one, that is a beginning
(intemperies inchoata) and another that is confirmed (intemperies confirmata;)
or into a primar and secondary distemper; It is of a confirmed and secondary
distemper that Galen speaks of here; but all beginning and primar distempers
are unequal, neither is a confirmed distemper equally mixed, but only equally
spread; for were it equally mixed, the body containing would be rendered more
durable by it, as in Vinegar, where the hot adventitious parts first causing an
Intemperies in wine, is afterward equally mixed with its fixed spirits, through
which its body is become more durable.

VI. A man is said to be temperate, whose temperament does dispose him to
perform his Actions and Functions perfectest. This temperament is not a
temperamentum ad pondus; for through it he could not have been hot enough to
have executed his natural or vital offices. Hence such a one is said to be
perfect temperatus, whose temperament ad justitiam is the perfectest, that is,
executes its offices most perfectly. The heat of this temperament is a mild and
gentle heat, or calor blandus. A Choleric man is as properly said to be
tempered ad justitiam, but then his temper is comparatively less perfect, and
his heat more sharp (calor acris.) Now when a perfectly tempered man is
distempered, his heat is sharp, which in a Choleric man is temperate, but that
heat is unequally mixed with the qualities of the first temperate party, and
equally in the latter; wherefore the same heat, which is counted temperate in
one, is intemperate in another.

Fernelius, Lib. 3. Cap. 11. excepts well against the denominating a man to be
of a choleric or Melancholy temperament, because the heat or coldness, which
Choler and Melancholy do produce, is unequally mixed with out temperatures, and
therefore do not constitute a temperament, but an intemperies; wherefore it is
more proper to state a man to be of a hot, cold, moist and dry temperament, or
to deduct temperatures from the Elements, and denominate them according to
their exuperancies, fiery, waterish, etc.

It is very proper to state the temperament of Air to be moist and hot, or cold
and moist, etc. because its various situation disposes it to mixtion with fire
and water for a moist and hot temperament; or cold and moist, if with more
water and earth then fire, etc.

But Aristotle spoke very improperly, when he said, that the air was of a moist
and hot temperature, when he supposed the air to be simple and unmixt. Now if
it was unmixt, how could it be said to be tempered? for according to his own
words, temperamentum est plurium; a temperament consists of more then one.

The Division of temperaments is manifold,

1. There is a single temperament, wherein one Element redounds above the
others, and thence according to its eminence, is called fiery, waterish, ayry,
or earthy: light with contiguity, light with continuity, heavy with contiguity,
or heavy with continuity: rare, dense, thin or thick: hard, soft, etc.

2. A compounded temperament, when two Elements are eminent above the others in
a temperament, as, fiery and waterish, fiery and ayry, fiery and earthy, earthy
and waterish, earthy and ayry, ayry and waterish.

3. When three exceed the restant one. According to which a Subject is said to
be waterish fiery and earthy, earthy ayry and waterish, fiery ayry and
waterish, fiery ayry and earthy. In the same manner can a substance be named
rare and dense, rare and thin, rare and thick, thick and thin, etc.

The number of Distempers are agreeable to the number of Temperatures, which
since they have been already enumerated, I shall not trouble you with the
rehearsal of them.

The Temperatures and Distemperaments of the parts of man's body are much
different to what Authors have described them, but their particular relation
appertaining to another Treatise^, I do wittingly omit their Insertion in this
place.

A Temperament is further divisible into an universal and particular
temperament.

An universal temperament is effected by the conforming of all the parts of an
heterogeneous body into one temperament.

A particular temperament is the temperament of every particular part in a
heterogeneous body; so a Bone is of a temperament differing from a Ligament, a
Ligament from a Membrane, etc. But a Bone and a Ligament agree also in an
universal temperament, viz. of the whole body.

A temperament is considered either absolutely in it self, or comparatively
with another, as one Species with another, according to which the Species of
man is most exactly tempered, as Galen has it, Lib. de opt. corp. constit.
above all other Species. This (...) of man is the Rule whereby to measure the
virtues of Medicaments, which if they do neither cool or heat, moisten or dry,
they are accounted to be temperate, or (...). But if they alter it either in
heat, coldness, etc. they are taken to be of a hot, cold, etc. temperament, or
(...).

2. One Individual may be compared with another in temperature, whereby one man
is said to be more or less temperate, hotter or colder then another.

3. An individual is compared to it self, and so a man is said to be more
temperate in one age, time of year, Climate, etc. then in another.

4. When one part is compared to another, one is adjudged to be more temperate,
hotter, moyster, etc. then another: So Galen, Lib. 1. de Temper. toward the
end, states the skin of a man's hand to be of an exquisite middle temperament
between all sensible bodies, and the most temperate of all the parts of man.

Authors propose another Division of Temperament into actual and potential; but
since I have declared my Opinion in the Dispute of Powers, I shall pass it by.

VI. It will not be useless to adumbrate the Combination of the Second
Qualities one with the other, and delineate their Effects.

Heat is either thin or dense. A thin heat does attenuate and mollify; for
molliaction is an action proceeding from a subtle attenuating heat, through
which it attenuates the thick Moisture, and elevates the body of earth and
water, whereby it is disposed to softness: Hence it is that the inward Crumbs of
hard stale Bread are softened by loosening its moisture, and admitting the ayry
fire.

A dense heat is drying and burning.

A thick heat is obtuse, not penetrating, but dampish, like unto the heat of
damp Hay.

Cold and thin is neither a powerful or piercing cold, but gentle and meek,
like unto the cool quality of a Summers Brize.

Cold and dense is a piercing and potent cold, striking through the central
parts of a body.

A thick and dense cold is condensing, congealing, and coagulating.

A dense thin Moisture does moysten very much, because it penetrates through
the pores of a body, and lodges it self there, whereas a single moisture is
too thick to moysten or to penetrate.

A rare Moisture moystens less by far, and is soon expelled.

A thin Moisture moystens somewhat more then a rare moisture; But both do
mollify.

The Ambiguity of Corruption. Whether Corruption be possible in the Elements.

I. IN the precedent Chapter I have spoke at large concerning Temperaments in
general, and their Divisions; to which ought to be annexed the distinctions of
Intemperatures.

An Intemperature That is, an inequality of the elements in respect to parts or
the whole, whereby the central parts are perfused with more hear or spirits
then the circumferential ones, but notwithstanding the mixture is equal in
particles.
moves either to an equal temperament and generation of a mixed body, or from a
temperature to corruption and dissolution of a mixed body.

The former motion is called Coction, the latter Putrefaction: the end of the
former is an equal and durable temperament, and the generation of a mixed body;
the end or rather terminus ad quem of the latter is a most unequal temperature
(that is, when a mixed body returns to its first elements; now when its several
ingredients are dissolved into their several elements, then they become most
unequal, because every element in its own region superates the peregrine
elements in three fourths, and yet there remains a temperature, because a
fourth part of the alien elements is united to each of them) and corruption of
a mixed body. The difference then between Putrefaction and Corruption is, that
the one is a motion to dissolution, and the other is an entire dissolution it
self. The same difference is observable between Coction and the generation of a
mixed body.

Alteration is a Genus to them all; for Coction and putrefaction are
Alterations in a lower degree; but Generation and Corruption are alterations in
the highest degree.

II. Alteration is a motion of the Elements, through which, they move unto,
into, through and from one another in a mixed body. The motion unto one another
I have formerly called their mutual embracement, the manner of which you have
read before. They move from one another accidentally and secondarily, after
they have embraced one another so close, that the contiguous Elements break
through the continuous ones.

I say Alteration is a motion; the same is attested by Galen, in his 7 Tom. of
his works, fol. 14. 4. By motion understand a local motion: for the Elements
change their places in alteration, and therefore a local motion. So that
Alteration is a Species of local motion. Through this local motion the Elements
do divide and penetrate one another, which Division through local motion does
fully comprehend the nature of Alteration.

Abra de Raconis in Disput. de Corp. mixed. sect. secund. asserts, that
Alteration does not terminate into qualities of the first Spec. to wit, Habit
and Disposition, because neither of them are acquired by motion.

2. He states, That Alteration does not extend to natural faculties and powers;
because these are produced in an instant.

3. There is no Alteration concurrent to the production of figure and form:
because these emanate from Matter.

To the contrary, Alteration constitutes Habits and Dispositions, Natural
Faculties, Form and Figure; because all these are produced by the forms of the
Elements acting through Alteration upon one another.

But to Answer to his Reason: I deny the first; for habits and dispositions are
acquired through motion.

2. I dislike his second Reason also; for they are produced in many Instants.

3. Figure and Form are in or out of Matter, but not from Matter.

III. Alteration is either successive or instantaneous. It is called
successive, because it is made up by many instantaneous alterations; like as
successive time is said to be successive, because it is constituted out of many
instantaneous times following one another; and nevertheless an instant is no
less properly time then successive time; for time is nothing else, but the
measure of one motion by another: Even so is an instantaneous alteration no
less an alteration then a successive alteration, because a successive
alteration is made up by many instantaneous ones.

An Alteration is called instantaneous, because it happens in the least time;
which is called an Instant. Or an instantaneous alteration is the least
alteration, whereby one Element alters (that is, divides) the other in one
minimum. Now since the beginning of action is from a minim or the least
substance, the action it self must be also the least, which among the Elements
specifieth an instantaneous alteration.

Alteration is to be termed continuous, when a continuous Element alters a
contiguous one; and contiguous, when a contiguous Element alters a continuous
one.

IV. Fr. Eustach. in Tract. de Elem. Quest. 11. makes a query how the
Elementary contrary qualities are intended and remitted through a successive
alteration.

1. He states it for a truth, that Heat, Cold, etc. do acquire new qualities in
their Subject.

2. That these new Qualities are entitative perfections, whereby heat,
moisture, etc. are intended.

3. The doubt is now, how this entitative perfection is possible to any of
these forementioned qualities: his Opinion is, that it is through addition of
new degrees of heat, cold, etc. to the former degrees of the same quality,
which are procreated out of the same Subject.

1. I deny that the forementioned qualities do acquire any other quality but
what they are; mix water with wine, and the mixture will have something of the
qualities of water, and something of the wine, but no new quality that should
be neither.

2. I reject his second Position as false.

3. It is erroneous that other degrees should be superadded out of the subject;
for if they are superadded, they are superadded either from the foregoing
quality, or an extrinsick efficient; they cannot be superadded through
themselves; for then a thing would be supposed to generate it self, which is
absurd, because (a seipso nihil fit) nothing is made by it self.

They cannot be superadded by another, unless it be by the same qualities, by
reason the cause must be of the same nature which the effect is of (qualis
causatalis effectus) if by the same qualities, then the same again would
generate it self; ergo they cannot be superadded, or if superadded from
without, it is no new quality, but agreeing with that which is intended.
Alteration is different from Mistion or a Temperament in general, because it is
an action, which disposes and prepares the Elements and their Forms for mistion
and temperature. The union of the Elements and Forms thus altered or disposed
is a mistion and temperament. Wherefore Aristotle defines the nature of Mistion
very well: Mistion is the union of Miscibles alterated.

Authors usually divide alteration in perfective and corruptive, which are
equivalent to Coction and Putrefaction.

V. Coction is an alteration tending to a temperament ad justitiam. Suppose at
the first confusion of the Elements in order to a mixtion and temperament, the
fire and air to be unequally mixed with the others about the remote parts, but
to be equally mixed with the central parts. Now Coction is nothing else but the
promotion of the light Elements, which are yet latent about the Center, to an
equal mixture (secundum parts, sed non secundum totum) with the heavy ones;
and although at present they are not so equally mixed That is, in the whole, yet
in parts, or if not in parts, they are in particles.
, yet through alteration, that is by dividing or embracing one another, the
earth dividing the fire, the water the air, the fire again moving to the earth,
and the air to the water, at last they become altogether entirely altered,
embracing one another, which constitutes a temperament ad justitiam. They being
all thus reduced to a temperament, the alteration is much abated, but still
continues, although in a very small and insensible manner, which causes a
stability for a while in the body so temperated: the reason of that great
abatement of alteration is, because the Elements being now dispersed and
divided into small parts, retain a less force, and exercise a less opposition
one against another, and therefore the temperament becomes stable.

Observe then that Coction is swift, because of the greatness of alteration.

2. The temperament ad justitiam is stable, and ad tempus quasi consistens.

3. Putrefaction is the swiftest, because its alteration is the swiftest, as
you shall read by and by.

Hence you may easily collect the reason, why a man in his youth alters or
changes so much, and at his adult years is seated in a consistent temperament,
and changes not for a long while, whereas a youth, we see, changes every day,
or at least it is observable every Month; for stay away from a known youth but
a Month, and when you see him again, you will mark that he is altered. This
every Mother can spy out after she has been gone forth from her Child but an
hour or two, and at her return, cry out, Oh how is my Child altered. The reason
is, because the calidum innatum is copiously shut up within the central
particles of each part, and therefore moves strongly by Alteration: Hence
Authors conclude Infants to be perfused with a more copious calidum innatum
then when they come to be grown up in years. The force of this (^^Nr^^)
promogenious heat is such, that it alters Children almost every moment; Hence
we may know why every external alteration of Diet, Weather, or Climate does so
easily injure them; because (besides that) they are much altered internally;
wherefore the least alteration from without, if durable, soon disperseth and
inflames their heat, and proves a frequent cause of so numerous deaths of
Children, whereas men and women their heat being now consistent, and making but
small force, their flesh closer, etc. are not so much subjected to Diseases,
and such sudden deaths.

VI. Women die faster, that is, thicker then men, and are more disposed to
sickness then they, because their innate heat and air do effect greater
alterations upon their bodies, as having but little earth or compressing
density, in comparison to men, to resist the light Elements, and moderate their
irruptions; and therefore women seldom reach to any equal or consistent
temperature, but are always in changing, which in them after 18, 20, or 24
years expiration, is particularly called breaking, because then they alter so
fast, that they swiftly put a period to their days; and that because their
bodies being lax and porous, their innate heat shoots through in particles, and
now in minima's, without which there can be no durable temperature. Were their
bodies heavier and denser, the minima's of earth would divide their heat into
minima's, and reduce it to a temperature. If then their innate heat does
constantly cohere in particles, and is never dirempted into minima's, it
retaining in that case stronger force then otherwise it could do in minima's,
it alterates their bodies continually, and so they never attain to any
consistency of age. Many sexagenarian Widowers or men of threescore years of
age do alter less and flower then most women do from their five and thirtieth
year; wherefore they do rather cover a wife of twenty, because she will just
last as long in her Prime, or will be as fast in breaking, altering and
changing her temperament, form and shape in one year, as the old man shall
alter or change in three or four years; and so they grow deformed in an equal
time. Wherefore a man's consistent age may last out the beauties of two or three
women one after the other: and because of this, some in their mirth have
proclaimed a woman after her 35th. year to be fitter for an Hospital, then to
continue a Wife. No wonder if a Woman be more fierce, furious, and of a more
rash swift Judgment then a man; for their spirits and heat moving in great
troops and confluences of Particles, must needs move swift, which swiftness of
motion is the cause of their sudden rages, nimble tongues, and rash wits. To
the contrary, a man's heat being tempered to minima's, moves more flow, and
therefore is less passionate, and of a surer Judgment. A Choleric man with a
soft and glabrous skin, is likest to a woman in temperament, and is undoubtedly
tied to all manner of Passion, as Fear, Love, Anger, to Rashness of Opinion,
forgetfulness, hazarding and foolish venturing, and at other times because of
his Fear, is as obstinate and refractory in hazarding.

He is perfectly unfortunate, of a short life, and disposed to continual
alterations, fitter for nothing then to fill up a Church yard in a short space
of time.

A man of a choleric and melancholy temperature with a soft skin and somewhat
rough, is likewise of a short life, but somewhat longer in his course then the
former. His Fancy is contrived for plotting of base and inhumane designs, his
Opinion is atheistical, his heart full of cheating and murderous thoughts, he
is merciless and cruel to all, his nearest relations are as great a prey to him
as strangers. Among men of this Temperature is a twofold difference, the one is
more choleric then melancholy, the other more melancholy then choleric. The
color of the first is yellowish, of the last swarty. The former exceeds the
latter by far in conditions, and is correctible, but with great pains, and
notwithstanding is of a detestable nature; but as for the latter, his pravity
is abominable, only fit to make a Hangman, or else is most likely to come to
the Gallows himself.

The best temperature of all is a sanguine tempered with melancholy; this
portends all honesty, modesty, faithfulness, pleasingness of humor, long life,
great fortunes, pregnancy of wit, ingenuity, a rare fancy for new Inventions,
tenacity of Memory, a sifting Judgment, profoundness of Meditations, courageous
and generous; in fine, fit for all things. Wherefore it was a true Saying of
Arist. that none could be wise, unless he was somewhat melancholy.

A pure sanguine temperature is of all humors the most pleasing, lovely,
perfectly innocent, of a long life, and very fortunate. I could set down here
demonstrable and certain Rules whereby to know infallibly the particular
Inclinations, Passions and Faculties of every person, but apprehending that the
Art might be abused by the Vulgar, and that the knowledge of it might prove as
prejudicial to some, as profitable to others, I judge it more convenient to
preserve its rarity and admirableness by secrecy.

Authors do successively attribute the causality of Coction to heat alone; but
how erroneously you may now easily judge, since that I have explained the
Elements to move each according to their proportion; as in Coction, Earth does
as much conduce to it through its contiguous and punctual motion to the Center,
as the fire does in moving to the Circumference; wherefore the Elements are to
be adjudged equal causes of Coction.

VII. Thus far we have spoken concernig Coction in general, and as it may be
supposed applicable singly to the Elements: What remains, is to treat of the
Species of Coction, depending upon the combination of the Elements, to wit,
upon heat incrassated, heat condensed, water rarefied and attenuated, earth
rarefied, etc. The Objectum circa quod of Coction is Crudity.

The Species of Coction are accounted to be three: Maturation, Elixation and
Assation.

Maturation is a Coction performed by a thin and moderately condensed heat
together with the co-action of the other Elements, whereby immaturity is
overcome, and its subject perduced to maturity or a temperament ad justitiam.
This kind of Coction takes place in man, who in his younger years is said to be
immature, and by process of time to be perduced or come to maturity. All
animals are perduced to their consistent Coction by Maturation.

Maturation takes its beginning from the Center; whence it is that the
innermost flesh of Beasts is the sweetest, because it is the first, soonest and
best concocted.

Maturation renders a mixed body more compact and solid then it was; because it
consumes and expels the ayry and waterish parts, which being diminisht, the
remainder is left more solid and compact.

Through Maturation a body becomes sweeter, as we may observe in all fruits
growing sweeter through Maturation, whereas they before were acerbous and
austere.

A body through Maturation is exalted to a greater purity.

Elixation is a coction performed by a rarefied and attenuated moisture, that
is an ayry and fiery water, and the co-action of the other Elements. Thus the
equality of temperament in Fishes, and other waterish bodies proceeds from
Elixation.

Through this thin and rare moisture all the parts of a mixed body are equally
laid, and through its fluor thick parts are attenuated, dense ones diducted,
and rare ones condensed.

Assation is a Coction effected from a dense heat acting socially with a just
proportion of the other Elements. Thus hung Beef, and dried Neats Tongues are
concocted. All Metals are likewise concocted or purified by Assation.

I shall not spend more words to show the manner of the variety of Coction,
since it is apparent by what has been said before.

VIII. A Decoction is an equal wasting of a concocted body, happening through the
continuation of a concocting alteration. Or otherwise it is an overdoing or an
overcoction of a mixed body, through which it must necessarily be wasted, which
notwithstanding remains the same thing, or according to Aristotle, remanet
idem Subjectum sensibile. But in putrefaction a body does not only wast, but
makes way also for a Dissolution, and the subject is sensibly changed.

2. Putrefaction derives from an unequal alteration, caused by an immoderate
and unequal adjunction of an extrinsick, influent or adventitious quality to
the least parts of one or more of the Elements.

But Decoction is equal, and performed by the same causes that Coction was.

Or in a word, the one is a violent and sudden motion to dissolution of the
parts of a mixed body into their first Elements; the other is a gradual,
successive, flow, durable, prolonged, and natural dissolution of a mixed body
into its Elements.

As for the manner of Decoction, it is thus. You must conceive that in Coction
the innate heat or whole temperament suffers but little loss or dislocation,
because at the formation of any body, the heat is so arctly joined to the
central parts, that although it is attenuated through the Air, yet firmly
adhering to minima's of earth, and surrounded with minima's of water, it cannot
be entirely loosned from its adherents, before it is minutely divided and
spread equally through all the body.

2. The Minutes of weighty Elements arctly compassing the fire, do detain the
same fire from exhaling.

3. When the Coction is perducted to its height, and the Elements are equally
laid, their forcible alteration cease, but nevertheless a small alteration
does still continue, every minim yet pressing against the other, whereby the
superficial heat does by little and little exhale, Or rather is expressed by
the overpowering gravity of the weighty clements, as you may read below in the
Chap. of Vacuum.
whose vacuity the nearer light parts do succeed to fill up, and afterward
those of the central parts next following. When now the heat is so much
dispersed and expelled, that it is grown invalid to balance the other Elements,
it is suddenly suppressed in an instant; after which instantaneous suppression,
another form succeeds at the same nick of time, and verifieth that Maxim: quod
Substantia generetur in instanti, that a Substance is generated in a moment.

The reason, why a form is so suddenly and in the least time expelled, and
another received, is, because when the heavy superficial parts, and those next
to them are freed from their light elements, they move all together with one
force, which force fa^^ing suddenly and violently upon that small part of the
remainder of the light Elements, does then violently and suddenly chase and
expel them.

By this it appears that Decoction is natural, because it is from an intrinsic
Principle.

IX. Putrefaction is a violent alteration of the Elements in a mixed body from
too great an irruption of an extrinsick elementary quality, which joining with
its like, overpowers the mixtum, and frees that Element from its nearest
alligation to the minimal parts of the other Elements, and so do both easily
overcome the mixture. Wherefore the cause of Putrefaction is an unequal
temperature or distemper effected by the superaddition of an extrinsick
elementary quality. The Causes in particular are four:

1. When the intrinsic earth is empowered by the adjunction of external
pressing terrene minims, which overpressing the innate heat, and dividing it
from the Air, first extinguisheth its flame, and then presses it out from its
body. This Species of Putrefaction may be called a tendence to petrification
and terrification. I will give you an Example: A man who is frozen to death is
properly said to have been putrified by a tendency to Terrefaction: for the
external frosty Minims pressing hard upon him together with the intrinsic
earth of his body, do at last extinguish his vital flame.

2ly and 3ly, when external Moisture is adunited to the internal Moisture, it
does also cause a putrefaction of that Mixtum, through over-relaxing and
opening the body, whereby the light parts easily procure a vent. Or rather are
the easier expelled by the down pres^ing earth.
This may be otherwise signified by a tendency to moulding. Those small
filaments that do usually adhere to the surface of a molded body are nothing
else but a diduction of the circumjacent Moisture into length and tenuity by
the egress of Fire and Air. The Greenness or Grayishness of the said filaments
is nothing but the fire splending and glistering against the circumjacent
Moisture, the refraction and reflection of which (arising from the proportion
of Crassitude or Tenuity of the body reflecting) causes a greenish light; and
if it be more transparent, the splendour appears grayish.

4. When fire is intended by addition of new degrees of external fire, and so
moves more forcibly toward the Circumference; Hereby the earthy and waterish
parts are divided from the light ones and cast aside; hence it is that we spy
such a clodding together of waterish and earthy particles, and their separation
from the light humors in blood drawn from a feverish patient.
its name may aptly be implied by a tendency to Combustion.

I have formerly asserted that Coction was a tendency to Generation, wherefore
Order and Method require from me at present, that I should illustrate the
Nature of Generation and Corruption, both which in a strict sense are the
termini ad quem and end of Coction and Putrefaction.

X. Generation in a large sense imports the constitution or Production of a
mixed being; but since that all generated beings are in a continual motion, it
is strictly attributed to the middle term, or a term of reflection, as I may
call it, where the exceeding quality does augment its force, afterward
insensibly and sensibly decreasing.

Notwithstanding a mixed body at its first production is an entire mixed body,
although it is not yet arrived to its full extension of parts: An Infant is as
much a man as a Giant, or is as perfect a mixed body consisting of matter and
form as the same Giant. Here I fall into a doubt, whether the seed of a Plant
or Animal is essentially distinct from a young Sprig or Plant, or a newborn
Animal. Is there any more difference between a Seed and its germined body, then
between an Infant and a man? What is a man but an Infant, thrust out into
length, breadth, and depth? And so what is a young Plant but its seed protruded
into all dimensions? We say an Infant is a man, because it bears all the
Figures and Shape, and acts rudely the same actions which a man does. Does not
the Seed within its Pellicle bear all the marks, shape, figures, and exercises
the same actions rudely that a Plant does? Does it not attract, retain, concoct
and expel in the same manner as a Plant? Is there any substance or new quality
advened to it, and essentially joined to its Minims? To this Opinion I find
Hipp. Lib. de Diat. Galen, Lib. 1. de Sem. Cap. 7. Argenter. Lib. de art. par.
tit. de Temper. Zabarel, de anim. fac. ult. Cap. 11. Picolhomin. Lib. 1.
Praelect. Anat. 1. Prael. Jonbert. Licet. and many others consenting. You have
this Controversy discussed more at large by that painful Collector of
Collections, Sennert. in his Hypom. Phys.

Authors assert strongly, that nothing can be computed to the number of
Efficients of generation, unless it be hot, where if they do not find a
particular hot Efficient, they accur to an universal one, the Suns efficiency,
or other Astral Influences. Pray, let them answer me, By what Efficient many
mixed bodies, as plants, Bears and others are generated in the Winter in
Greenland? which that they are, is undoubted to many; but supposing them to be
generated in the Summer, which is colder then our coldest winter, they cannot
comprehend the Suns heat for an extrinsick Efficient, because the cold does by
far exceed the heat in those Countries, as appears by the great Islands of
Ice; wherefore the efficiency is rather to be imputed to an acute cold, which
through its acute weight does divide and spread the included heat into the
parts. I do not deny but that there is an admitted Efficient in the juice and
food which they do suck in and ingest into their bodies, which here, as in all
other coctions, stirs up and diducts the innate heat, and being adunited to it,
strengthens and augments the same: But I pass by this to what is more plain.
Ice and many bodies generated thereon, as stones, etc. are mixed bodies, and is
it the heat of the Sun that does effect these? Ergo Cold with the other
qualities are equally to be stated Efficients.

XI. Before I take my leave of this Subject, I must discuss one Controversy
more, whether the innate heat be not endued with a power of changing extrinsick
heat being admitted within the quantity of the containing body into its own
nature, and to convert it into innate heat. On the one side we might judge it
impossible that so little heat, as is contained within the Seed of a Vegetable
should be sufficient to perduce a Tree to that great bigness which many are of,
and continue so for many years. On the other side, Authors do unanimously
conclude, that the innate heat is destitute of such a virtue, and that the heat
advened to it is an influent and admitted heat essentially differing from it,
the one being of a celestial origin, the other of an elementary. Arist. Lib. 2.
de Gener. Animal. Cap. 3. declares his Judgment upon this matter: (...). For in
the Seed of all things there is that contained which makes them to be fruitful,
to wit, that which we call heat. Neither is it fire, nor any such faculty, but
a Spirit, which is contained in the Seed and in the spumous body, and the
nature, which in the spirit is respondent to the Element of the Stars: And a
little further he repeats his mind; (...). It is evident that the heat in
Animals is neither fire, nor any thing arising from fire. If then it is
according to the mind of Arist. to state the innate heat to be Astral, and the
influent heat to be elementary, there must intercede a quidditative difference
between them, and consequently being of so distant natures, the one cannot
beget the other.

Before I conclude, it will not be amiss to enquire what they intend by ((...))
Innate heat. Galen, Lib. advers. Ly. writes, that the innate heat is a body,
whence most Authors make a distinction between (...), caliditas, heat, and
(...) hot; the former importing a nude quality, the latter a body. This body is
constituted out of a primogeneous ((...)) Moisture, Celestial heat, and insited
Spirits, according to which Fernel. Lib. 4. Physiol. Cap. 6. sets down this
definition; Innate heat (calidum innatum) is the primogeneous moisture perfused
throughout all parts with an insited spirit and heat. But why ought this
mixture not rather to be denominated a primogeneous moisture from the
substance, then innate heat from the quality, since that a substance is counted
to be more noble then an Accident?

2. What difference is there between an insited spirit and innate heat?
Certainly none; a spirit consisting of heat and moisture, and so does the
other: Or if you make a difference between them, you are like to fall into an
error; for if a spirit be a complete substance, as all Philosophers do grant,
and that be united to another substance, namely a primogeneous Moisture, they
must constitute a Totuns per Accidens, but none will assert the innate heat to
be a totuns per Accidens; Ergo.

3. I find a variance among them in these words, (...), connate, and (...),
innate; some taking them for one, others limiting (...) to heat, that is only
proper to living creatures, and applying (...) to heat, that is common to all
mixed bodies, and is subjected to Putrefaction, as if connate heat were not
subjected to Putrefaction as well as the innate: Does not the connate heat of
man suffer putrefaction in a Hectic Fever? You may further read of a fourfold
difference of innate heat in Argenter. his Treatise of the innate heat.

1. I conclude that the connate heat is elementary, and not astral. I prove it.
There was connate heat before the Stars were created; ergo its Original was not
thence. The Antecedence is plain from Scripture, Genesis 1. for there it appears,
that Herbs, which questionless were actuated by connate heat, were created the
third day; whereas the Stars were not created before the fourth day. 2. Where
the effects and operations are alike, there the causes cannot be unlike; but
the effects and operations of Astral heat are no others then of Elementary;
ergo although I granted it to be Astral, it must also be elementary.

2. Innate heat is said to be a spirit, because its rarest substance is
adunited to the least bodies of the other Elements, whereby it is fortified,
and becomes more potent, and is constituted a most subtle moveable body. The
purest and most potent spirits are about the Center; they next to them are not
so subtle; others yet more remote are grosser.

3. The connate heat has a power of converting influent heat into the same
nature it self is of. I prove it. Hippocrates teaches, that the maternal blood
and the sperm are perfused with innate heat; if then advenient blood can be
united to primogeneal blood, ergo influent heat may be united to the innate
heat, and converted into the same nature. 2. Flesh contains a part of connate
heat in it, but cut off a piece of flesh, and Nature will restore it again; if
restore it again, then innate heat must be restored with it: if so, then this
innate heat must be generated out of the blood by the innate heat of the next
adjacent parts.

4. Childrens teeth are regenerable, but teeth contain innate heat in them;
ergo innate heat is regenerable.

5. That, which the fore-quoted Opinion stated a putrefactible innate heat is a
volatick and moveable heat, which not being subtle enough to be united to the
fixed or connate heat, is protruded to the external parts, and is subjected to
putrefaction; so that in the body of man the food that is daily ingested, its
subtilest part serves to be converted into innate heat, and to be substituted
into the room of the last consumed innate heat. The courser parts are converted
into moving and external heats: By Heats Calida understand hot Particles.

6. How is it possible, that so little innate heat, as is contained within a
Dram or two of Sperm should be sufficient to heat the body of a big man?

XII. Corruption is the dissolution of a mixed body into the Elements, or into
other bodies more resembling the elements then it. The Cause of Corruption, as
I said before, is the greatest putrid alteration, whereby the innate heat is
violently dissolved. In Putrefaction the moving heat alone is altered, which is
reducible; but if it continues to a great putrefaction, then the innate heat
suffers danger, and is yet likewise reducible; but if the greatest putrefaction
seizes upon a body, then the innate heat is strongly putrified, and is
rendered irreducible, because through it the greatest part of the innate heat
is corrupted, which to expel, the remaining innate heat finds it self too
impotent. But if only a less part be corrupted, and the greater abide in power,
it may overcome the other, and reduce it self. Hence a reason may be given, why
many men having been often seized upon by Fevers, yet have been cured, and their
innate heat is become more vigorous then ever it was, yea some live the longer
for it. The reason is, because in most curable Fevers, the moving spirits
alone are affected; neither does the Alteration reach so deep as greatly to
disturb the innate heat, but often times the body being foul, and the blood
altered by peregrine humors, the body is cleansed, and by its fermenting and
expelling heat the blood is freed from these noxious humors, after which the
primogenious heat is less oppressed, and acts more naturally then before,
through which life is prolonged. Here we may answer fundamentally to that so
frequently ventilated doubt, whether life may be prolonged to an eval duration?
Paracelsus and many of his Sectators do maintain it affirmatively, to whom
three hundred years seemed but a slight and short age, and in stead of it
promising a Life of Nestor to those as would make use of his (Arcana)
Mysterious Medicines, yea a life to endure to the Resurrection. But these are
but Fables and Flashes; for since that a man is unequally mixed, and that one
Element does overtop the other, questionless the predominant element will prove
a necessary cause of the dissolution of that Mixtum; but was a man tempered (ad
pondus) equally, and as Galen has it, tota per tota, his Nature would become
eval, all the Elements being in him composed to an equal strength in an equal
proportion. If then otherwise the radical heat and moisture do sensibly
diminish, certainly old age or gray hairs cannot be prevented. Possibly you
may imagine a Medicine, the which having a virtue of retarding the motion of
the vital heat must of necessity prolong its life in the same manner, as I have
read in some Author, I cannot call to mind which, a Candle has been preserved
burning for many years without the adding of Moisture to it, by being placed in
a close and cold Cave deep under ground. Here (if true) a flame was retarded in
its motion by the constringent cold of the earth, and thereby the Tallow was
saved by being but a very little dissipated through the motion of the fire. I
say then, could the natural heat be retarded by such a constrictive medecin,
as to catochizate it, and hinder its motion, life might be protracted to some
hundreds of years: But again, then a man could not be suffered to eat or drink
in that case, because that must necessarily stir up the heat, which excited,
if it were not then ventilated by the substracting the forementioned
constrictive Medecin, whereby it might dissipate the acceding moisture, must
incur into danger of extinction. But this prolongation of life pretended by
Theophrast. Par. is attempted by hot Medecines, such as they say do comfort and
restore the natural Balsom of man, which is so far from retarding old Age, that
it rather does accelerate it; for if the heat is augmented, then certainly it
must acquire a stronger force, whereby it procures a swifter declination, as
has been showed. Besides, Experience confirms this to us: Many having
accustomed themselves to take a Dram or two of the Bottle every Morning, viz of
Aq. vit. Matt. hoping thereby to fortify their heat, and so to prolong their
years, have by that means enflamed their heat, and soon kindled it up to a
corruptive fire: and to this purpose, I remember a notable Instance, which some
9 or 10 years ago I observed at Leyden, where visiting the Hospital weekly with
the public Professor of Physic, I took notice of a Patient, being a man of
about 40. his Temperature choleric, his habit of body thin and rough, his skin
changed to a brownish tawny, and full of wrinkles; his complaint was only of an
universal faintness when he went; his Urine was overcocted; enquiry being made
into the Constitution of every particular part, they were found to be like
affected with an Atonia calida, or Intemperature toward heat: a further search
was made into the cause of so universal a heat; his Diet and Course of Life had
been very moderate, only he confessed that by advice of a Physician he had
accustomed himself to take half an Ounce of Aq. vit. Matt. every morning for 6
years together: Here the cause was found out, namely, the over-comforting and
augmenting of his vital flame, which was now become so potent, that it had
penetrated all the body, and was ready to diminish and decrease every day,
whence through its daily progress it had wrought such strange effects in this
man, that he although but young, appeared to be as old as a man of 70. Even
almost such another Patient I saw in the Charity Hospital at Paris.

Wherefore it is evident, that by such means life is not prolonged but
shortened: neither will the Oximel Squillit. of Galen, so much commended by him
to keep back old Age, do any more then the forenamed Aq. vit.

1. I conclude then that old Age may be retarded, and Life prolonged, but by
other means, then ever has been derected hitherto by any man; however
Lactantius writes, that Adam used a most excellent and admirable Magistery in
his Family, through which their years were much prolonged. Many describe the
length of life of the Patriarchs to the same mysterious Medicine, which was
successively discovered to them by Adam. I have read of Artephius, and others
in the days of old, who are said to have protracted their days to a thousand
years by help of Art, and means of using the Tincture of Gold, and sometimes
the Tincture of Steel.

I have also read of a Maid, who had lived for many years without eating or
drinking, she was not any thing sensibly altered in all that time, but lay
constantly a bed, or moved seldom, unless it were to turn her. As I think, you
may find the Relation of it in Schenckius his Observe. Here you have a plain
Retardation of Age by a Catochization of heat and the other qualities: for she
being Phlegmatic, her radical Moisture was thereby incrassated, which
incrassation kept her innate heat in the same flame for a long time, until that
it was loosened by procatartick Causes. I shall speak more at large concerning
the Catochization of fire in its flame below.

Through the same Catochization of the Elementary qualities other inanimated
bodies were likewise preserved and retarded in their Alteration, insomuch that
the bodies so catochizated have not undergone the least sensible Alteration or
change in hundreds of years. The Egyptians had a way of preserving dead
bodies three thousand years, as we read concerning their Mummies, in such a
manner that the Corpse could not suffer any sensible change in an Age, or
otherwise how could they have lasted so long? The search into their manner of
Embalming leads us unto the knowledge of such a durability. They dipped close
woven Linen into a melted mixture of Gums, Rozins, Wax and Spices, in which
they wrapped the Corpse, rolling it sundry times close about, which afterward
they put into a thick Leaden Coffin, and shut it up in another Oaken Coffin,
and placed the same in a deep, cold and dry Celler or Cave, being closely
environed with dry Sand and Marble Stones. All which caused a greater
condensation of the earthy parts, incrassation of the Moisture, and seizure
upon the fiery and ayry parts, and a detention of the said parts in the same
situation as they were seized upon: or it may be, they were a little more
divided, whereby their force was somewhat clipped and stopped in their motion;
however there remained so much force as to keep the fire safe from being
violently expelled by the weighty Elements; in such a manner that there passed
no opposition between them, but they were seized upon, and so derained as a man
is in a Catoche, upon which ground I call it a Catochization. Did there pass
any remarkable action between them, then the light parts must acquire a vent,
whereby the body must necessarily change and approximate to a dissolution.

2. The greater incrossation of Moisture does keep in the heat, and indurates
the body; for were it thin, it would mollify and open the body, and give
occasion to the egress of the intrinsic heat.

3. The shrowding of the Corpse in many Folds of Gummed Linen does hinder the
air from penetrating to it, which if it did, it would soften the body, and make
way for the effuge of the light parts.

4. The Spices consolidating the body through their drying faculty, conduce to
the detention of the heat.

5. The Coldness and Dryness of the place, and of the Coffins do contribute to
the same action, and preclude the way to the ingredient Air.

All other inanimate solid bodies are preservated and prolonged in their
duration by detaining them in Quicksilver, Snow, Wax, shining Amber, Honey,
Syrrups, Gummes, Oils, wet and dry Sand.

As for a burning Flame, it cannot be so rigidly detained as to have its Smoke
totally kept in, which reverberating upon the heat, and joining with the other
weighty Elements, would violently expel the heat: but as I said before, the
detention by condensation and incrassation must be no more, then that the smoke
may pass; yet in small flames this is not so much necessary.

There is another means, whereby to prolong life by keeping the heat in a
flame, and is performed through averting the heavy Elements, and attenuating
and lightning them by Art; for otherwise they would violently extinguish the
flame. Wherefore by the combination of these two means, namely Catochization
and aversion by way of detention, there may be an infallible Medecin compiled
for the prolongation of life, and retardation of old Age. But of this more
particularly in my Principles of Physic.

2. Concl. Production of life to an eval duration is impossible. Were it that
the necessity of man's dissolution was independent upon an improportionate
temperament of the Elements, yet Gods Decree, and Judgment would necessarily
bring it upon him, Genesis 2. 17. But of the Tree of the Knowledge of good and
evil, thou shall not eat of it; for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou
shall surely die. Job in the 17th. Chap. declares the necessity and certainty
of man's death, particularly in v. 5. Seeing his days are determined, the
number of his Months are with thee, thou have appointed his bounds that he
cannot pass. I cannot here omit the detecting of that dull vulgar Error and
Doubt arising about these very words of Job. Their way of Argumentation is, If
the life of man is determined to a year, a Month, Day and Minute; ergo it will
prove in vain for me to have that care of my health, and caution of hazarding
my Life at Sea or at Land: In fine, there is neither Anticipation or
Posticipation of Life. Man acts voluntarily, that is freely, without any
necessary or fatal impulse; wherefore one who is drowned at Sea, was not
compelled to go and be drowned, but went thither freely, or might have stayed
away; if then he might have stayed away, ergo his life might have been
prolonged by staying away. Or otherwise, suppose a man is diseased with a
Gangreen in some one extreme part of his body: Cannot we say that this man, if
he lists, may have his life prolonged by ampntating the gangrenous Member, or
if he will, that he may accelerate his death in suffering it to increase and
creep on? But to Answer to the Text. Determination of Days is twofold.

1. Of the Natural Course of man's Life: as, suppose that the Temperament of man
will last and endure (if it run off in a Natural Course) to a hundred and
twenty years, some more, some less; now this term may be said to be Gods
Determination of the Days of man, when he has determined that his temperament
shall endure no longer then he has made it to endure naturally.

2. There is a Determination of life before it has run out his natural course,
as when God does manifestly cut down a man in the full strength of his years.
Again there is an ordinary determination of the duration of beings, by which
God has determined, that all things shall have their natural course of being,
acting and continuing. Were it not for this ordinary determination of God, he
would never suffer the wicked to live, or that any Natural thing should be
serviceable to them.

2. There is also an extraordinary Determination, through which God has
determined to act beyond his ordinary determination in, through, or upon
things, which are ordinarily determined. This determination is secret, and
called Gods hidden will. Neither does his extraordinary determination
contradict, or clip, or change his ordinary determination, but that God may or
does sometimes determinate beyond it. This premitted,

I do assert, that the determination of man's days in the Text, is to be
understood of Gods ordinary determination of the Natural Course of man's Life. I
confess although God according to his ordinary determination has determined
the Natural course of man's days, yet he may through his extraordinary
determination prolongate the same man's life to many years, and notwithstanding
thereby he does not contradict his ordinary determination; for a man having run
out his full Natural course of life, has therein answered Gods ordinary
determination, which being expired, God may, and sometimes does supernaturally
and by his extraordinary determination superadd other natural Principles,
through which his life is prolonged; thus was the life of King Hezekiah
prolonged by God superadding new Principles of life, whereby his life was
protracted 15 years longer; for through Gods ordinary determination he must
have died fifteen years before; because all his natural heat was spent through
his Disease, and his temperament run off: Wherefore, as the Text says, 2 Kings
20. 1. he must have died of a necessity; but God extraordinarily superadding a
new heat, and a new life prolonged his days.

In the same manner does God oft-times through his extraordinary determination
cut down the wicked, and shorten their days, Psalm. 55. Look back to the 9 and
10 Chap. of my Nature. Theol.

Here may be demanded, how Adam and Eves Bodies could have been of an eval
duration, supposing they had remained in their Innocence, their bodies being
tempered ad justitiam only, and not ad pondus. I Answer, That (according to all
probability) their primogenial temperature was by far more perfect
(compariative) then ours, and therefore did not consume faster then their
Natures could adunite other parts in the room of the dissipated ones; besides
that heat which was dissipated, was only part of the moveable heat; as for
their fixed heat, that was so arctly united and tempered, that its nexe was
indissoluble, which through their Fall is become soluble.

This Controversy is stated and handled more at large by Beverovit. Lib. de
vit. term. and Gregor. Horst. Lib. 2. de Not. human. Exerc. 4. Quest. 10 and
11. whom you may peruse at your leisure.

As Generation did import a twofold signification, so does Corruption.

1. In a large sense, it implies a natural dissolution together with the
declining alteration thereunto tending.

2. Strictly it signifies a violent dissolution of a mixed body through a
preceding Putrefaction. Hence those may be advertised, who do erroneously
confound Putrefaction and Corruption, taking them for one.

Its Species are Combustion, Petrification, Corruption by waterish moisture,
and Corruption through ayry moisture. You may easily understand the natures of
them by what has been spoken before.

Whether Corruption is possible to the Elements, as they are now consisting
mutually mixed one with the other, is a Doubt moved by some. I Answer, that a
total Corruption is impossible, a partial one happens every hour; for we see
ayry bodies, as Clouds, dissolved every day: the like happens in the Region of
Fire, where fiery bodies are dissolved every day, and others again generated.
In the Earth and Water some bodies are likewise corrupted, and others generated
every day; so Gold, Silver, and all other hard Metals, are sometimes violently
corrupted under the earth, from an extrinsick potent and putrefying heat.

I. WE are now to ennumerate and unfold the remaining qualities risen from the
mixture of the Elements; such are Light, Colors, Sounds, Odors, and Sapors.

We will first begin with Light, as being the excellentest among them.

Light is a quality emanating from flaming fire. A flame is nothing else but
incrassated Air expanded and deducted in rotundity by condensed fire, which is
detained and imprisoned within the foresaid qualified Air. The difficulties
requiring illustration are, 1. How the fire comes to be condensed. 2. How
imprisoned. 3. Why the Air does immediately surround it. 4. How light is
propagated, and the manner of its action.

As to the first: Fire I have told you will not burn unless it be condensed;
for being naturally rare, it penetrates through the incrassated Air with ease:
but being condensed it does not, because it is adjoined to a heavy gross body
(namely, the minima's of the Earth and Water) which does put a stop to its
pass; but nevertheless the force of fire is stronger by reason of those
adjoined heavy minima's: For fire being violently detained by them is grown
stronger. 2. Fire being to divide another thick body makes use of the
compressing accuteness of Earth to divide it, which it effects by protruding
those dense parts before it; for through its single rarity it could not.

2. Fire flying out and being expulsed out of a mixed body, if it does not meet
with incrassated Air to retain it, will pass and vanish; but hitting against
incrassated Air it strives to pass; the Air again being continuous does
maintain her continuity with all her force; and thirdly, the fire moving
circularly makes a circular dent into the mass of the said thickened Air, which
it beats against, the advenient Air also striving from all parts to recover its
situation, and therefore necessarily surrounding the fire. The Air again is
also become stronger, because of its violent detention, notwithstanding the
fire being the more potent does diduct it into an oval or round Figure, in the
same manner as Wind striving to pass the water does blow it up into a bubble.
Fire being thus condensed, imprisoned, and surrounded with thick air, and
diducting the same air into an oval or round Figure is called a flame.

II. The properties of a flame are 1. to be burning hot, 2. to be an (lux
illuminans) illuminating light. The burning proceeds from the particles of
condensed fire violently striking through the moisture of a mixed body, whereby
it divides it into ashes, or a black crust tending to ashes. Before I show the
manner of emanation of Light, let us first examine, what it is we call Light By
taking advice from our sense.
. Light is that which is visible, and renders all things about it visible.
Wherefore you do mark, that Light is nothing but that, which affects and moves
the eyesight. If then I make it appear to you, whereby it is that fire does
affect the Eyesight, therein I show you the manner of emanation or operation
of Light. You must apprehend the optic spirits to be a thin continuous body,
equally interwoven through all its parts with a proportion of thin yet a little
condensed fire, (for were it not a little dense it could not heat) so that it
is very like to the ambient air in substance and its other qualities. 2.
Supposing it to be an air, we must conceive it to be continuous with the
ambient air, when the eyes are open. This premitted, I infer light to be
nothing else but a continuous obduction of the Air caused by a flaming fire.
But let me here entreat your serious intention upon what I shall discover
concerning the nature of Light, it being one of the difficultest mysteries of
all Philosophy, and although its effects are luminous to the Eye, yet its
nature is obscure to the Understanding. The search of this moved Plato to leave
Athens and set sail for Sicily to speculate those flames of the mount AEtna.
Empedocles the Philosopher hazarded himself so far for to make a discovery of
the nature of a flame and its light, that he left his body in the Mongibell
fire for an experiment, although much beyond his purpose. It is almost known to
all, how that the Learned Pliny took shipping from the promontory Misenas to be
traversed to the Mount Pomponianus, whither curiosity had driven him to fathom
the depths of the Vesuvian flames, but before he could feel the heat the smoke
smothered him.

III. First then I prove that Light is an effect of a flame. There is no flame
but it causes light, and by the light we know it is a flame; Ergo, Light is an
inseparable accident, and a propriety quartimodi of a flame, the Antecedence is
undoubted; Does not a Candle, a Torch, a focall flame cause lights? Or did you
ever see light and doubted of the flame of it? What is the reason, when we hit
our foreheads against any hard thing, we say there strikes a light out of our
eyes? It is, because the violence of the stroke did discontinuate the optic
air, through which the condensed fire That is the spirits dispersed through the
optic air.
did unite and diduct the intrinsic air, which was incrassated through the
same stroke, and so made a flame, or rather a flash, which is a sudden flame,
that is quickly lighted, and quickly laid.

Secondly, Light is not a single quality, inhering in fire alone: for were it
so, then where ever fire is, there should be light; but to the contrary we
find, that there is fire inherent in the air, and many other bodies, yet the
air remains dark after the descent of the Planets. 2. Were fire naturally
light, we could never be in darkness, because the vast Region of fire is so
large, that it could not but illuminate thrice the extent of the air.

Thirdly, Light is not fire rarefied and exporrected throughout all the
dimensions of the air: for who could ever imagine, that a Candle, being so
small a flame, should serve to be drawn out through the air, and fill it with
light to the extent of six or eight Leagues? for a Candle may be seen at Sea in
a clear dark night six or eight Leagues off or further, so that it is absurd to
imagine this, and unworthy of a Philosophers maintaining it. 2. It is
impossible that fire could be so exactly mixed with air in an instant for so
large an extent. 3. There is never a particle of illuminated air, but it is
light to the full extent of the illumination, if so, then there must be a
penetration of bodies.

Fourthly, Light is not fire rarefied; for were it so, then that fire which is
most rarefied should be lightest, but the consequence is false, Ergo, the
Antecedence also. I prove the falsity of the consequence: Fire in Brimstone, or
flaming Brandy is more rare than the fire of a Candle, and yet it does nothing
near enlighten so much as the flame of a Candle. Fire most rarefied, as it is
naturally, is not at all light. That is lucid.
Lamps have burned in Tombs for many years together, and have enlightened the
same for as many years; but it is absurd to conceive, that fire could have
lasted, or been sufficient to be rarefied through the air for so many years;
some simply deny the possibility of it, although the same may be brought to
pass at this present time.

4. Where light is there is not always heat near to it; for if the contrary
were true, then an equal light must have an equal That is equal in proportion.
heat; but this is averred to be false in Greenland, where in their day-season
it is as light as it is in the East Indies, and lighter th^n it is in the
Indies in the Winter, and yet the heat in the Indies is infinitely more intense
than it is in Greenland; for here it is never hot, although less cold at some
times above others. Some Author makes use of a musical Instrument of Cornel.
Drebbel to prove against all sense and reason that where ever Light is, there
is also heat. These kind of Instruments are common enough now adays; they were
Organs and Virginals that played by themselves; All which (says the Author)
depended upon the rarefaction and condensation of some subtle body, conserved
in a Cavity within the bulck of the whole Instrument: for as soon as the Sun
shined, they would have motion and play their parts. And there is no doubt, but
that grew out of the rarefaction of the subtle Liquor he made use of, which was
dilated as soon as the air was warmed by the Sun beams. Was ever a wise man so
much wronged as to be made to believe, that a little subtle Liquor could blow
the bellows of Organs, and that the beams of the Sun should penetrate through
Boards and Iron and rarefie the Liquor contained therein; and that the
interposition of a cloud should lessen the sound of the Instrument; if so, why
should not the interposition of a board rather lessen the sound? for a board
shall keep away more heat from a thing than the interposition of a thin cloud.
The business is this, there was no heat required to the motion of the said
Instrument; for had there been so, a fire made in the Room could have supplied
the action of the Sun after its descension. The Instruments were made to move
by a piece of Clock-work, which was placed near to the keys; the work it self
was moved by weights hung to it, or otherwise by a thing made within it like to
the spring of a Watch; now when the wheels are almost run about, then the keys
strike feebler, and so the sound is diminished; this he calls the interposition
of a cloud; neither is there any such rarefaction as he imagines to himself,
and therefore is infinitely mistaken throughout his Book in the nature of
rarefaction and condensation: Wherefore this is no proof that the Suns light is
always hot.

2. The same Philosopher argues, That the reason, why we do not feel the warmth
of Light, is because it is not hot enough to move our tact; for that, which
moves our tact by hear, must be of the same warmth, or hotter. This is another
supposed subtility of his. That, which is not warm, cannot be said to be hot,
because heat is a degree above warmth; now in case there is so little warmth in
a mixed body, that the cold of earth or water does overcome it, that body is not
to be called hot, or warm, but cold; even so it is here, in case that Light
has not so much heat as to warm, but rather cools, as we feel it enough in the
Winter, it is not to be said to be hot, but cold.

Who could imagine that a Candle should heat the Air twenty or thirty Leagues
about, its light extending about in circumference to little less?

IV. Light is a continuous obduction, or thrusting up, or puffing up of the
air, which puffing up is, as it were, an opening to the whole body of the air,
in the same manner almost as wind being puffed under water raises and puffs up
the whole body of it to a large extent, by which the water seems to be opened
throughout all its body. I say it is continuous, for were it a disruption of
the air and not continuous, it would cause a sound. A continuous obduction is
an equal drawing up or support of the air to the Circumference: That, which
does originally cause this obduction, is the fire condensed, which bears the
air up equally and circularly, like as when you blow sudds up into bubbles,
which likewise seems to create a light. The air being obducted originally about
the light, its whole body is also obducted to a far extent at the very same
moment: For supposing that the air is continuous, and that there is no such
condensation (as the Vulgar imagines) as is effected by penetration of parts or
diminution of quantity, the air being trust up at one place, must also be trust
up all about to a certain extent: The same is manifest in water, by puffing a
thick wind through a Reed underneath it, which little wind (although
unproportionate to the heavy body of water, which it raises) puffs up all the
parts of water at once, that is, in a moment; the reason is, because the water
being continuous, and nothing between it throughout all its dimensions but what
is continuous, lies as continuately close (which is the nearest closeness) as
can be conceived; wherefore puffing one part up, you must necessarily at the
same instant puff up all the other parts about it; because they cannot
introcede into one another. Or otherwise, the reason why so improportionate a
body should suffice to bear up so heavy a body as the water, (for a puff of
wind, if it be blown deep under the water, will raise fifty pounds of water,
more or less, according to its force) is, because the wind having moved the
nearest parts of water, they bear one another up continuately unto the very
Surface. So it is with the air being puffed up by the fire, which at the same
instant does puff up all its parts about.

Here you may object, If the air be obducted in that manner by the flame of the
fire, and that it gives way continuately throughout its whole body without an
intrinsic incrassation, then the least fire must stir the whole tract of Air
about it. I answer; That the Air is partially incrassated To wit extrinsecally
by peregrin water.
, and not thoroughly throughout all its dimensions; wherefore when it is so
puffed up it is only obducted in its extent according to the force of the
flame: and when it is so stretched (as it were) through the fires obduction, it
receives the force of the flame partly only, because it is contracted by
expelling the extrinsick bodies contained within it, and so yields to the fires
obduction. The clearer the air is, the greater light it makes, because it
containing no extraneous bodies cannot contract it self from the obtension of
the fire by expelling such bodies, but being totally continuous it is obtended
so far as the said air is continuous That is homogeneously continuous.
, and according to the force of the fire. The reason then, why a light is
terminated, is through the contraction of the air, and often times through the
density of an intermediate body as of thick vapors and exhalations. According
to the diminution of the flame, the air relaxes and so the light diminishes.

V. The cause why a dense body is incapable of generating a light, is by reason
it is contiguous, and cannot be obducted, or stretched, as it were.

I have said, That that is light which moves our eyesight: even hence I will
sensibly prove to you, that light is nothing but a continuous obduction of air.
Suppose that the optic spirits are for the greatest part an air, to which the
external air, when the Eyelids are open, is joined in continuity and becomes
one continuous body with the optic air, in a manner as when one float of water
touches another they become continuately one. Wherefore then, when the air is
continuously obducted, as far as where it is continuated to our optic air, it
must necessarily also obduct and stretch the same optic air, because it is
continuous to it. That light moves the sight by stretching the optic air is
evident, in that when we look against the light, although its origin is far
off, we feel a stretching in our eyes. 2. When we have wearied our selves by
seeing we complain that we feel a stretching in our eyes. In case the air is
not obducted so far as to reach our eyes, then we do not see it; as when a
thing is out of sight, the reason, why we cannot see it, although nothing is
interposed to hinder, is because its stretching does not reach as far as our
Eyes. Hence you may observe, that (visus non fit emittendo sed recipiendo motum
flammae,) sight is not actuated through the emission of beams from our sight,
but through the receiving of the motion of a flame, and more through suffering
(patiendo non agendo) than acting.

VI. The fire of a Flame is to some extent dispersed through the Air, and so
far it heats the Air: nevertheless its enlightening is much further extended.
The Sun, which is the greatest Flame, its heat in the Summer reaches to us in a
very intense quality, its light would reach a hundred or more times further
then it, were the tract of the Air extended to a larger quantity; but because
it is not, therefore its heat in the torrid Zone, and in the temperate ones in
the Summer, reaches as far as its light, which although it does, is not
therefore to be accounted the essence of Light, as some have simply imagined.
So that it was no less Mistake to believe that the Sun's light could be
precipitated in a Glass, and some to have collected of it no less then two
Ounces and half a day: The virtue of this Precipitate is described to penetrate
into the substance of the hardest Metal. I do believe that it is very possible
to precipitate such small bodies constituted out of the fiery emissions of the
Sun, whose virtue cannot but be very penetrative through the predominance of
fire in them; but nevertheless it is not the light which is precipitated, but
fiery substances, neither is fire the light it self, but the cause of it. Light
is a property following the union of a flame with the Air, wherefore the Air is
rather to be taken for the principal Subject.

VII. Light is not the primar cause of all the effects produced by the Stars,
but their temperament and exsuperating heat. Accidentally or privatively their
remoteness and remission of heat may be a cause of coldness, and incrassation
of the Air, and consequently of its obscurity. The light of the Sun does not
comfort the vital Spirits, neither does it act immediately upon them at all,
although through its heat it may help and excite the vital heat of some frigid
temperatures.

The light has only a power of acting immediately and per se upon the Optic
spirits, and through altering them, may prove a mediate cause of Vital and
Animal Alterations. I prove it. If you go forth out of the dark into the light,
you feel a distention, or rather an obtension of your visive spirits; return
again out of the light into the dark, and you will first perceive a relaxation,
and afterward a contraction of your sight. The mediated effect of light is a
quickening of the Vital and Animal Spirits, which are moved by continuation from
the obtension of the Optic Air.

A sudden great light causes a bursting of the Air; which happens, when the Air
is so much obtended, that it can stretch no more, and then, of a necessity it
must burst. A bursting is a sudden breaking of a body throughout all its
dimensions and parts as it were. The air is bursted through a great lightning
or a flash before a thunder, which if the same bursting do reach diametrically
to the optic air of an open eye, it will certainly blind yea sometime kill a
man, because the same bursting is continued unto and upon the optic spirits,
and sometimes is also further continuated, that it bursteth the whole Treasure
of the Animal spirits, which necessarily must effect an Apoplexy. A man coming
forth suddenly out of the dark into a great light, is often struck blind,
because his optic Spirits are bursted through the sudden and strong obtention;
or if it obtends the optic Air to the next lower degree, so as it may not
cause a bursting, it then produces a dazzling of the sight, that is, an
over-stretching of the optic spirits.

VIII. How light renders all things visible is a matter worthy of Enquiry.

The air being thus obtended and made visible through light, is terminated
every where about by the surfaces of terminated bodies. These terminated
surfaces resist the obtended air, and according to their several degrees of
mixture or of fundamental light and darkness do attenuate, refract, diminish,
contract or condensate the obtension. If the surface of the resisting object is
continuous and weighty, it attenuates and refracts or reflects the light of the
air; and of that nature is water, for water being adunited to air in
continuity, does not only sustain the obtension of the air, but also through
its reflection obtends the obtended air yet more, and so the obtension upon the
water must be greater, by reason it stops the obducted air more then any thing
else; wherefore its light is thinner, but withal greater, and makes all bodies
therein contained show greater. Besides, water containing much air in her body,
suffers also an obtension of that, whereby bodies must necessarily appear
bigger then they are. The reason why a piece of Money in a Basin with water
appears bigger then it is, is because the water through impregnation with
peregrine air, proper thickness and continuity does reflect, and admit much
obtended air or light, which being altered by the color of the money, does
appear much bigger, then if seen through thin air alone.

Light is diminisht, because the air is condensed, so that whatever does
condense the air must diminish its light and obduction. Whatever body light
appulses against, it is thereby darkened, because the body, which it strikes
against, condenses the air.

According to this degree of condensation, the light is gradually diminisht,
and darkened; if it be terminated in a most dense earthy body, then it appears
black; if against a body, that has less earth, or density, it appears brown,
that is to say, at the point of reflection against an Object; and so gradually
in all other.

This change being wrought upon the terminating obtension by an objected body,
it is repercussed to a certain distance, namely, as far as the repercutient
action of that object can reach, which is as far, as until the Air does recover
its proper station. If we are far off from an Object, it appears less then it
is, because its action does diminish gradually like unto the streams of water,
which about the center of action are greater, but the more remote they are, the
less they grow.

A Flame is called a Light (Lux) because it begets light. The light begot in
the Air is called (Lumen) an Illumination. Wherefore these lights are not
really distinguished, but ratione. Neither is a flame to be called a light,
unless when it does obduct the Air; neither is the Air to be termed a light or
illumination, unless when it is obducted by a flame.

Radius, a Beam is a diducted line of a flame tending directly from the Center
to the Circumference.

A Splendour is the intention of light by a reflection or refraction upon a
thick continuous smooth body.

The Lights begot by the Stars, and other flames, are not distinguished specie,
because they depend upon the same causes, namely, upon Fire and Air. Their
difference consists in consistency, purity, bigness, etc.

The Coelum Empyreum, or Heavens of the Angels are said to be lucid; which may
be understood tropically, or properly. If properly, possibly it has a virtue
of obducting the air like unto a flame. If tropically, lucid is equipollent to
glorious. The Bodies of the risen Saints shall appear glorious and splendid,
possibly because they shall be more ayry and fiery, that is flammy.

I. Color is a Mode or Quality of a mixed being, through which it moves the
sight: if so, then certainly Light is a Color: For,

1. It proceeds from a mixed body.

2. It moves the sight primarly, immediately and per se. I prove it. We do
distinguish light from darkness, and a light body from a dark one by our sight;
ergo it moves the sight.

Probably you may deny my Definition of color; wherefore I shall for your
further satisfaction compare it with that of Aristotle, and prove it to be
consentaneous to it, differing only in Precision, ours being less universal and
nearer to sense then his. Lumen (which is equipollent to color) est actus
perspicui quatenus perspicui. Light or rather Illumination is the act of a
perspicuous body: quatenus perspicui is redundant. By actus is implied an
actuation or motion.

2. By perspicuous is intended a body, that is capable of receiving or rather
of reflecting light; And is not the sight capable of receiving or reflecting
light, and of being actuated by it?

Or if you will take color for a quality, following the temperament and
mistion of the Elements, the difference is not great, this being a Definition
of color as it is considered in itself a priori; the other described a
posteriori relatively and accidentally; for it is per accidens to it to move
the sight. I cannot but reflect at Scaligers boldness, who pretending to exceed
Cardan in subtility, so as he seemed to reprehend and correct him in every
Distinction, but with more absurdity then he supposed Cardan to be less subtle;
and particularly about Colors and light, Exercit. CCCXXV. d. Compare the
quoted place, other wise you will scarce apprehend the sense of these
consequences.
2. Here he infers a real and formal difference between an Accident and its
Subject; the contrary has so plainly been demonstrated.

2. That an Accident is constituted out of a Power and Act. The falsity of
which is detected in my Disp. of Pow. These Assertions are not exempted from
Absurdities.

1. An Accident and a Substance being really and formally different, and owing
their production to one substantial efficient, it follows that a Substance
produces effects differing from it self in specie.

2. That a Substance is an efficient of a Power and Act. Power and Act being
two positive contraries, one substancial efficient is inferred to be an
efficient secundum idem ad idem of two positive contraries; for a power
according to Aristotle is not a privation; for then it were a non ens reale,
but a positive.

3. Neither is Power or Substance the true matter of color. Not the power; for
that is like to the matter: not the substance, that being the sole whole
substance: Wherefore if neither power or substance be the true matter, it
cannot be any real thing; because whatever is real consists of Matter and Form:
Wherefore (says he) we should say that it has a substance for its subject,
wherein it is inherent; but in it self it has a power and act out of which it
is made one in the subject, and distinct from the subject, out of which essence
that property of visible is produced. A manifest contradiction: First he says,
that an Accident has always a substance for its subject, and yet in it self
it has a power and act. Assuredly none will affirm a power to be in an
accident, but in the subject for to receive such an Accident; this he allows
himself: for an accident (says he) is always in a substance as its subject;
ergo it has its essence from a subject: if then a subject gives its essence,
it gives praecedentia and consequentia esse: it is then the power that is from
the subject, as also the act; ergo an Accident is nothing but the subject
modified.

4. Constituting Principles, as Matter and Form, are required to exist at one
time: but the power and act cannot exist at one time; for as soon as the act is
advened, the power is fled. If then you assert it to be a principium
generationis, then the subject thus constituted does consist of a Principle
perse, and another per accidens: Besides it follows, that an accident is an
actus purus; if so, then an accident is more perfect then a man or an Angel.
Wherefore it appears that a color is nothing else but a modification of a
subject, and of the same rank that other accidents are of; besides, that color
is exempted from a power and act, and that the substance is rather to be
conceived to be instructed with a power of being colored. The subsequent
distinction confirms my Interpretation of his words: For (says he) light is an
act of visibility: that is, it is an action upon a visible substance; for
visibility in the abstract being invisible, he ought rather to have declared
how a lucid substance acted through its modality, or action upon our sense. The
same Scaliger in the said Did. asserts, that Light is neither white or
whiteness. No doubt it is no whiteness; for that he never saw existent without
a body, unless it was a Spirit in his Fancy: But the question is, whether it is
not white? His Argument alleged against it is, because it cannot be seen in
the Air, and does not terminate the sight. The former condition of his Reason
is simpliciter necessary: the latter is only necessary (necessitate
consequentiae) by consequence. I reply to his Argument:

1. That light is visible in the air, as I have showed before.

2. Light were it imaginable to inhere in an infinite subject, it would be
interminate, and yet move the sight terminately; for a man who is blinded by a
thin Cataract, knows when it is day, and when night, because the light of the
Sun moves his Optic Air, although very obtusely, and yet he neither sees the
termination of the Sun, or of the Air.

3. Light is not invisible, because of the thinness of the Air; but visible,
because of its obductibility.

4. The airs intermination is falsely supposed to be the cause of its
invisibility: for it is really terminate, because a being and termination in
the concrete are convertible. Further it is evident, that light must be
necessarily terminated both in the body, whence it is derived, and in the body
wherein it is received; notwithstanding it is not always necessary for us to
perceive or see the lights termination in it self; for that we seldom do,
although it is terminated in and by our sight. According to our forestated
definition light is accounted a color, but most single, that is, without any
composition, or reflection.

II. I call light a single color, not absolutely, as if it were so in its own
nature and constitution, but because it moves our sight singly without
representing any mixed color with it to the sight. This single motion of light
is only its obtension continuated in the optic air, and is otherwise known by
the name of an interminate Pellucid. Because it is represented without being
terminated by any mixed color.
In case light be reflected and gathered in great quantity by air thickened and
somewhat condensed by thin and by a little condensed clouds, it produces a
thick pellucid or whiteness in the air, which continuated to the optic air,
produces the same whiteness there. This we perceive when the Sun is said to
shine, which it does ever, when no thick dense clouds are interposed, and that
its Rays are condensed by thin clouded air being a little condensed. That the
thin shining light is whitish, is further apparent by the Peripatetick
description of white. White is a color, which does most disperse the sight;
but so does the Sun shining light; ergo it is whitish. Or according to others,
White is that, which contains much light: ergo light is most white: because
(propter quod unumquodque tale est, illud magis tale est) Light being the cause
and fountain of white, must be most white in it self.

III. Light (Lumen) is actus visibilitatis (says Scaliger) that is, it renders
a visible thing visible: But how? not efficienter (for then without light in
the air there should be no fundamental colors, and every color must be
produced through light at the moment of its appulse) but as a medium or causa
sine qua non. As a medium in that it does defer the ratio obductibilitatis of
every Object to the eye. The manner of it is thus; every mixed color is nothing
else but the degree of the alteration of the mixed objects wrought upon the air
by their greater or less pinching, contracting, or deading of it: Supposing
that the greatest extention of the air causes a pellucidness, that which
gathers, contracts, or deads the air a little and stays its obtension is
white; that which gathers it yet more is yellow. That which does gather it
most is black, that which gathers it less is brown, and so gradually. This
gathering of the obtended air by the objected mixed color is a kind of a
pinching, whereby the air is continuately pinched, to the extent of a certain
Sphaere. The air being pinched does continuately pinch the optic air, which if
it be a little pinched by an objected color, it discerns it to be white, or
if very much it discerns it to be black; hence when we enter into a mourning
Room hung about with black cloth we perceive a perfect pinching or contraction
in our Eyes.

Here may be demanded, Whence this various manner of pinching proceeds, since
that pinching is caused by a solid object, if so, then the solider an object is
the more it should pinch, and consequently the blacker it should be, which
seems erroneous; for Gold is of a yellow color, which otherwise should be
blackest, because it is the most solid of all bodies. I answer, That this
various manner of pinching By pinching here do not understand a greater
obtension, but rather a relaxing or withdrawing from, or a contraction of the
light, and drawing of it from the sight by being relaxed, drowned, and deaded
by a dense weighty body.
depends upon the degrees of the gathering of light or obtended air. That which
does most gather or deads the air, being a continuous or fluid body is a dense
and contiguous body; so that the more dense that a body is, the more light it
gathers, and pinches the stronger, and consequently is the deeper colored. But
that, which is continuous although very thick yet it gathers nothing near so
much as a continuous body, because its continuity hinders its pass, and so the
light reflects upon it and produces a splendour, whereas a contiguous body
divides the air and gives way for its entrance, and so it pinches, and next
darkneth it. Wherefore Gold being continuous, that is, consisting of much water
condensed, and air incrassated, reflects the light, and so produces a splendour.
Now, that Gold consists of those moist parts; I prove it, because Gold
contains a Lentor in it, (which is a concomitant of water and air, as I showed
you before) for cast a piece of Gold into the fire, and let it lie there for
some proportionate time, and being taken out you may diduct it into any form or
figure, and turn or bend it any way. Since that Gold consists of a proportion
of continuous parts, it is thereby rendered splendid, and yellow from the
proportion of contiguous parts contained within it. Wherefore if you reduce
Gold into a Calx, you deprive it of its splendour; because you have taken away
its continuity of parts.

IV. Give me leave to demonstrate to you the reasons of all the various colors
which Mercury attains to through its various preparations; and thence you may
collect the reasons of Colors befalling all other bodies, (whether Mineral or
Vegetable) through their several preparations.

Mercury is 1. splendid, because of its thick continuity of parts.

2. Its Silver-like color derives from its paucity of contiguous parts, which
it containing in that small quantity does render it a little darker than white,
and is the cause, why it is not pellucid like unto water.

3. The reason why Mercury becomes white like unto a white frost by being
dissolved by Aqua Fort. is, because it is diducted and attenuated through all
its dimensions, and therefore collecting and pinching the light a little only,
it appears white Or rather by coagulating the white salt of the Aq. Fort.
.

4. Mercury changes into a yellow color after it has been dissolved by oil
of Vitriol, and being separated from the dissolvent by exhalation it abides
white, but being cast into water it changes yellow.

The whiteness, which remains in Mercury after the evaporation of the oil, is,
the color of the corosive salt coagulated into an attenuated body by the
Mercurial virtue. The casting it into water does deprive it of the
forementioned salt, which is dissolved into water; that, which does remain, is
the courser part of the salt incorporated with the Mercury, whose substance
contains such a proportion of earth as to gather so much of the obtended air and
to pinch it into a yellowish color.

5. The whiteness of Mercury sublimate corrosive, and of Mercury sublimate
Dulufied derives more from the attenuated salt, than the body the Mercury.

6. The same corrosive Mercury sublimate dissolved into fair water and
precipitated by oil of Tartar changes into a clay red; Here you must not
imagine that it is the oil of Tartar in a drop or two does color the whole
substance of the precipitated body; for it self is of another color, besides
were it of the same it is improportionate to color a whole body by a drop or
two. It happens then through the deprivation of the thinner parts of the
corrosive salt swimming in the water. That, which the oil of Tartar performed
in this preparation, is nothing but to free the body from its detaining spirit,
which it does by attracting it to its own body, and uniting it self with it
into a small body; the red color depends upon the quantity of thickened earth
of the precipitate.

I shall not importune you with the relation of colors befalling through other
preparations, since you may easily infer a reason of them from what has been
proposed concerning the variation of colors in Mercury.

V. From this discourse I do further infer, 1. That the formality of colors
does mainly consist in a respectiveness and relation to our sight, and is no
hing else but what man by his sight discerns it to be, for had man no sight
there would be no colors, although there would be an alteration upon the air
extended. Likewise light would not be light but air obtended: So that I say the
Absolutum fundamentum Relationis suppositae would be there, but not ipsa
relatio, because the Correlatum is defective. The like understand of sounds,
sents, or tastes, which as to us are nothing but certain realities moving our
animal spirits by certain respective modes, which realities moving the senses
in certain modes are called such or such sensible qualities: what they may be
further really in themselves we know not, because we perceive no more of them,
than what we call such and such; the others, although real, yet we suppose them
to be non entia, because we do not perceive or know them. But I prove the
Proposition, All positive and absolute beings perform their actions responding
to their modes; But none of these forementioned qualities may be so termed
sensible qualities (to wit, colors, sounds, and unless modifying the senses.

2. That a mixed color is not an intentional quality produced by the colored
object in the air, but a real quality, really inhering or effected in the air
by the original action of a fundamental color. What shall an intentional
quality act really? Ergo, Quiddam esset in effectu, quod prius non fuerit in
causa, which contradicts that Maxim concluding the contrary. Besides, color
would be affected with two sorts of accidents, one really inherent in the
object, the other in the air. 3. It supposes accidents to migrate e subjecto
in subjectum, which is impossible. Nevertheless Scaliger pretends to prove
Light to be a quality produced in the air and distinct from the efficient; that
is, that Lumen is really distinguished from Lux, if so, then Lumen could exist,
when Lux is separated and removed from it; but that cannot be, ergo there is no
real distinction between them. According to the same rule we might raise a real
distinction between the colored object immediately altering the air, and the
color or lumen produced in the air from that color being a Lux in comparison
to the other. This real distinction is rejected by the same Arguments: because
a color in the air or a Lumen cannot exist, when the color (or Lux) in the
object is removed.

3. That notwithstanding the respective formality, there is a real foundation
in colored bodies, which is a certain degree of temperature, whereby they
being somewhat contrary to our sense move and act, but mediately, upon its
temperament.

4. That through this absolute foundation a color does move or act really upon
the air, and through it upon other inanimate bodies, yet not as it is a color,
but as it is an absolute foundation or a degree of temperament. This motion is
not very considerable; for although it may move a light thin body out its
place, yet it will hardly move locally a thick or dense body, wherefore it is
ridiculous to opinionate, that lumen of the Stars, otherwise termed their
Influences, should be the causes of so great effects upon great bodies, as are
adscribed to them.

VI. Colors are generally divided by the Peripateticks into two sorts, viz.
into true, and apparent. True Colors are such as do really inhere in their
subjects in the same manner, as they are represented to the eye. Apparent ones
are those, which are not really inherent in their subjects in the same manner
as they seem to be to our sight; such are the colors of a Rainbow, or of a
Peacocks feathers, or of the Seawater: because these according to the several
distances and position of the eye seem diverse. The cause they impute to the
light (Lumen) which according to its various aspects renders the said colors
various: the error of this Doctrine will appear from these Conclusions.

1. All Apparent colors are real and true colors; as for their being real
colors but few do doubt of it, because they do really move the sight. That
they are true colors I prove hence: That, which is a real color, must be a
true color, because a being and true are convertible (ens and vernm
convertuntur;) wherefore if it be a color it must be a true color, or else
none; for it does as really and truly move the sight as that which is strictly
called a true color, or how should we see it else? To this you reply, that you
do not deny it to be true a color in one sense, namely metaphysically; but in
another, and in respect to a true color strictly so called, it is not true. I
answer, That all the difference I find between them is, that the one is more
durable or less changeable than the other, which does not make the one more or
less true than the other; for did an apparent color move the sight otherways
than it does, it would be no true color, but it moves the senses as it is, and
to most men's sight it is the same continuing its duration: For when we see a
Rainbow, its colors do appear the same to all standing in the same place; but
were they not true, they would appear in one shape to one, and in another to
another. As for their different appearances and shapes at several distances and
positions is as well incident to those, which they call true colors, as to
apparent ones; For a Picture, where the colors are all real and true, will
vary at several distances and positions. You will say, That a Picture will not
vary in color, if you look upon it from the right opposite place, where the
light is cast in a due proportion. I answer, Neither will that, which you call
the apparent color of a Picture vary, keeping the same place and distance: And
what difference can you then make between them? The only difference between
them is their more or less durability and changeableness which proceeds from
its greater or less compactness of mixture. The color of a Rainbow is as true
a color at that position and distance, as of any other object, it differing
alone in durability; for suppose a color to be altered by a reduplication or
over-casting of another color in substance, but the same in appearance; as for
instance, a painted face having its natural color hid under a painted color,
certainly you will say that the latter is only an apparent color; if so,
wherein is the latter different from the former being a true color (as you
call it) but in durability? To wit, the paint wears off, and the other abides.
The same is observable in the clouds, whose lasting color is bluish, their
fading or painted colors are the rays of the Sun incorporated with their
bodies, really and truly altering their lasting colors; nevertheless this
latter is as true a color, as the paint was upon a painted visage.

VII. The differences and number of colors are various and many; for every
temperament has a several color attending it: But as it was not every
insensible alteration of temperament, that constituted a new temperature,
saving that alone, which is sensible; so neither does every insensible
alteration of color constitute a new color, but only such a one as is
sensible. Colors are either durable and less mixed, (mixti e paucioribus; non
vero minus mixti) or changeable, and more mixed, that is, with extrinsick
heterogeneous bodies: So that a durable color arises from a compact
temperament of the Elements included by extrinsick bodies; the other depends
upon a less compact union of the Elements.

Changeable colors are various also according to the lights reflection, or
refraction, and its various incidencies upon objects which causes them to
appear either whiter or blacker, or otherwise lighter or darker. A changeable
color is sometimes accidental to a persistent color, as appears by the
forementioned instance of a painted face.

Colors are extreme or intermediate. Extreme ones are such, as cannot be
intended or heightened in their action, as black (I mean that, which is
blackest) cannot be heightened; that is, it cannot be supposed to pinch and
drown the light more than it does. These extreme colors depend upon the
extreme or greatest proportion of the superating Element in reference to the
whole: So that in case fire is the greatest predominant, its body is white; if
the earth, its subject is black. According to this supposition there are four
extreme colors, because there are four extreme proportions of the Elements:
Which are these; White, Black, Crystalline, and Pellucid. This is made known to
us, 1. In that Sea-coal consisting of most earth is black. 2. A Flame
consisting of most fire, is white, to wit, the Sun. 3. The Air consisting most
of ayry parts is Pellucid. 4. Ice consisting most of waterish parts is
crystalline. I will further prove this by reason: If blackness be proper to
earth and earthy bodies, whiteness must be proper to fire and fiery bodies,
they being opposite correspondents to one another in all qualities. The color,
which is in water and waterish bodies, is neither white or black, ergo it must
be an extreme color of it self; for since that each Element obtains distinct
extreme qualities, the same must also be in colors. Who would say that water
is white or black, or partakes of any white or black from fire or earth;
wherefore Theophrastus was to be blamed for adscribing yellow to fire, and
white to the three others. That, which moved him to appropriate yellow to focal
fire, was, because for the most part in flaming or burning it seems yellow and
reddish. To this I answer, That the color of focal fire is not an extreme
color, because fire is not inherent in focal fire in its greatest proportion
and predominance, it having much earth to obscure its extreme whiteness, and so
it is turned to a yellow or red, but where fire is in his greatest predominance
and least counterpoised by earth, there it seems always white, as appears in
the color of the Sun, and in oil or fat cast into focal fire burning white.
Here may be objected, That Snow is white; Ergo, it should consist most of fire,
which it does not. I repeat my distinction of durable and changeable colors,
and affirm that whiteness depending upon fire is deprehended only in durable
and compact permixt bodies; the other inherent in changeable subjects and thin
open bodies derives more from the ingredient light entering their pores, where
being a little pinched and collected appears white, so that this may be thought
to be as much the color of the condensed light as of the body, which lasts
no longer, than it is condensed by condensed water, and that being melted the
color vanishes withal; possibly you will turn your objection to a bone,
which being white, does not contain fire predominating in it. I answer, That a
bone consists of much fire and air as appears in its flammability, and
therefore is white. Lastly, you may object, That a Marble stone or Alabaster is
white, but neither are fiery. I answer, That both do consist of a condensed and
attenuated water, and not without a little rarefaction caused by the fire.
Suppose that Marble were only a natural water, which as I have demonstrated is
naturally thick and consistent like unto Ice, and condensed with a little
earth, certainly it would be of a transparent and crystalline color; this Ice
being yet more condensed by earth pinches and collects the light a little, and
so appears white. Wherefore observe, that this white is primarily an extrinsick
color depending on the incidence of light, and not fundamental alone wrought
by the internal temperature of the mixed body. So that this objection does
conclude nothing against our Assertion mentioning intrinsic colors acting
from a compact mixed body. The reason why Marble and Alabaster are shining is,
because their body is consistent of a continuated substance, to wit, thick
water.

Intermediate colors are such, as arise out of the descent of the Elements
from their extremes: To wit thus, The less there is of fire, the less it is
intrinsecally and fundamentally white; the less there is of earth, the more an
object diminishes in blackness: Which degradations constitute the intermediate
colors.

Intermediate colors are almost infinite, but enumerating them according to
the above-stated condition of Latitude of Colors; they are vulgarly counted
ten in number: 1. Yellowish, Subflavus, 2. Yellow. 3. Reddish; Subruber. 4.
Red. 5. Greenish. 6. Green. 7. Bluish. 8. Blew. 9. Brownish. 10. Brown.

Red is an equal mixture of Black and White, and is the Center and middle of
all colors being equally interjacent between the two extremes: so that all
colors are between Red and White, and between Red and Black, as appears in the
subnext scheme of colors.

Before I proceed, I will commend to you a very necessary distinction of
intermediate colors, which are either fundamental or extrinsick. The
fundamental intermediate colors are those, that are constituted by the
internally proportionated Elements in temperament, and are compactly permisted.
The extrinsick colors are such as are as much imputable to the external
incidence and ingredience of Light.

This premitted, I say, that a fundamental Red does only consecute a body mixed
and temperated ad pondus, which was alone in the Chaos, the noblest of colors
befitting so noble a body. Of those red colors which we now have, a sanguine
comes nearest to it, because it proceeds from the exactest temperature ad
justitiam, which is nearest to that ad pondus. The change from this toward the
extremes (as before) constitutes a different color: if to water, its change is
into a green, as you may observe in the blood of hydropick bodies appearing
greenish; if to air, bluish, as you see it does in the clouds, which is
changed out of a Red Cloud being dispersed into a greater measure of air; if to
Harth, Brown: if to Fire, Yellow, which is manifest in Blood turning to a
Yellow, if predominated by fire or Choler; to Brown if predominated by
Melancholy or Earth; to Blew if attenuated or incorporated with predominant
air. Besides these, there are many others, which because approaching to some
one of the forementioned, I shall not think material to relate, but refer you
to Scaligers CCCXXVth. Exerc. where you have the names of most colors set down.

What Splendour and the cause of it is, you know already: its opposite is a
deadishness, which as splendour is effected upon a smooth and continuated body,
so is this effected upon a ruggid and contiguous body.

Luminous and Opake are also Opposites. The latter is distinguished from black,
in that this is taken for a fundamental color, the other for an extrinsick
privation of light.

VIII. Reflection of light is the beating back or reaction of a splendid or
thick body upon the obtended air, which Reflection obtending and stretching the
air yet more, then it was before makes it apdear much lighter. That it is made
lighter, is discerned by the eye, which is more forcibly obtended by the
reflected light, which if it be much, causes a dazzling in the eyes, and is
nothing else but an over-retching of the optic air and Membranes, and
sometimes is so great that it presses water out of the eyes. Reflection is only
upon continuous bodies, as Gold, Silver, Brass, Steel, Precious Stones, Glass,
and Water, etc.

IX. Refraction of colors is a reflection seeming to be broke; as when you put
a Stick into the water, the color of it seems to be broke. By an internal
reflection its color seems to be more augmented in quantity and extent of
parts, then really it is. The manner of it is thus: Mark that a superficial
reflection does not augment the extent of a color, which reflects the light;
for Gold or Crystal is not augmented in extent of color, that is, seems not
bigger then really it is by reflecting light superficially, neither do they
render a color in the air bigger then it is.

2. A double reflection is the continuation of a reflection Or a reflection
continuated.
; for there is also a reflection of light within the very body of an object, as
you may see by a piece of Money cast into the water, or big Sands lodged
sometime within the center of a Diamond or Crystal, causing a reflection
although remote from the Surface; wherefore a Color is not well described by
Arist. Lib. de Sens. and Sensil. to be the extremity of a terminated
perspicuous body; for I have told you where and how it may be visible in the
intrinsic body of an Object. Notwithstanding this, Scaligers Objection, in
Exerc. 325. d. 4. against color stated to be the extremity of an Object, is
invalid. His Objection is, because a Chestnut is colored in the middle as well
as in its extremity; ergo, says he, Color is not the extremity. But how did
he know a Chestnut to be colored in the middle? Questionless by seeing it cut
through; if so, then that middle cut through is now come to be the extremity,
and so there appears no great subtility in his argument. Wherefore I do grant
that a fundamental color is also in the center of an opake body, but then it
is no formal Color, that is, it is not actu visible, except in the Surface
Namely of an opake body.
. Crystalline bodies are internally visible throughout all their parts, and do
augment the extent of a color. To augment the extent of a color is to dilate
it, or to make it less pinching upon the air, then it was without reflection:
for example, an Apple seen through the air appears no bigger then it is; but if
held over the water, and its color perceived reflected, seems much bigger: the
reason is, because the color of the Apple pincheth the air, which air thus
pinched beating against the water, is reflected, that is, is beaten back again,
which reflection is a greater obtension of that air so pinched, and the same
obtension or stretching must needs dilate that air thus pinched, which dilation
is the augmentation of the color of the Apple. The color of the apple
impressed upon the air by its pinching seems to be rendered paler through the
said reflection, because the dilatation of the air being through it made
lighter, does through that light somewhat expel the obscurity of the color of
the Apple. Here observe, that this reflection is not a single reflection, but a
reflection upon a reflection, which I call double.

I will more amply explain it to you: A single reflection is, which does
reflect upon the extreme surface, and descends no deeper; thus it is upon Gold
or Brass. The double reflection is, when this extreme superficial reflection is
continued and propagated by the circumferential parts next adjacent to the
extreme surface, which makes the first reflection stronger, and therefore more
dilatating the colored air, which more dilatating of the colored air makes
the color appear sensibly larger, although the color is somewhat dilated by a
single reflection, but it being insensible, we do not state it to be larger.

The reason, why an Apple held over the water and seen at a certain distance
obliquely from the side, appears much more enlarged then seen directly, is,
because the light is reflected in a larger extent, and consequently the color
impressed upon it must be more dilated.

Hence you may also be resolved, why some Looking-Glasses render ones face
bigger and paler then it is. This happens through the thickness of the Glass,
wherein the second reflection is continued from some depth, and therefore does
more obtend the air, and dilate its impressed color.

Thin and gibbous Glasses render a face less and swarthy, because they do less
reflect the light, and rather loosen its obtension through their thinness,

A little piece of a plain Looking-Glass does represent no more of the face
then its bigness will permit; so that if it be no bigger then your eye, you
will see no more in it then your eye.

A gibbous or spherical Looking-Glass, be it never so little, does represent
the whole face of a man, although but obscurely. Now let us enquire into the
ground and cause of these different Representations.

Alhazenus and Vitellio seem to assert, that all colors are represented in a
Pyramid, that is, by being equally fastigiated from their extreme circumference
unto a point of reflection; and therefore they term this optic Pyramid
simpliciter an optic figure, as if all colors whether radial or luminous,
were represented through it. But this is contradicted by the Experiment of a
plain Looking-Glass, where the figure of an Object is not at all augmented or
diminisht, but reflected in an equal extent, as it is represented through a
simple vision. Notwithstanding it holds true in Objects reflected upon spherick
Looking-Glasses, where (as I have proposed just now) objects if circular, are
reflected in a conical optic figure, and if lineal, their radiature is
reflected in a triangular or pyramidal optic figure. The (...) of these is
vulgar enough; but the (...) I could never hear from any.

1. It is certain that all colors are represented through their direct Rays,
or in direct Lines.

2. These Rays are nothing else, but the pinchings of the luminous air by the
Objects.

3. These pinches being plain or sometimes bubbly are equally and plainly
reflected by a plain Looking-Glass, and therefore the Object reflected seems
equal to the Object when perceived by a simple vision. But in case the Object
be reflected by a spherical Glass, then the central parts of it are reflected
by the extreme protuberance of the Glass in a sloping manner; not plain,
because the body reflecting is not plain; for it is the reflecting body, which
gives it its extent of figure, as I said before; if it be plain, it reflects
that bubble plain, that is, stretches it out to a plainness, which must be full
as big as the Bubble can stretch out. But the reflecting body not being plain,
but falling slopingly, the colored air falls down with it, and is thereby
contracted into a lesser extent in the same manner, as when you spread a
Handkerchief upon a plain table, the Handkerchief thus extended is of a larger
figure then when you cover your head with it, where its figure is contracted to
a less compass, because of the declining figure of the head.

IX. Robert Flud Tract. 2. Part 4. Lib. 4. sets down this division of Glasses:

A Glass is either regular, or made up out of regulars. A regular Glass is
plain or difform. The latter is 1. A Concave, which causes a thing to seem
bigger then it is. 2. Convexe, which causes a thing to seem lesser then it is.
3, and 4. Pyramidal and Columnal, making a thing to appear longer then it is.
5. Spherical, which causes a thing to seem broader then it is. To these difform
Glasses, Cylindraick, Conical and Parabolical Glasses are to be referred. The
causes of their various reflections you may easily deduce from our Discourse;
wherefore I shall spend no more time about it.

The obliquated Radiatures of an Object are propagated to a certain distance
and sphere, beyond which the said Object is invisible. Hence you may know why a
piece of Money being placed in a Basin, and going back from it until it is out
of sight, comes to your sight again, if you cause water to be powered upon it.
The propagation of an Object reflected is circular, and therefore to as many as
can stand about that Basin where money was placed in, the same will appear.

The various Colors appearing to the eye looking through a Prism are effected
through the gradual diminutions of Light passing through the depth of the said
Prism, and modifying the Sand contained within the body of the Glass, the same
colors do also appear to us when we see against the Light through a Glass full
of water.

X. But to pursue my discourse of Refraction. There must not only be a
Reflection, but also a discontinuation or abruption of planeness or equality of
the Body reflected, and thereby it becomes as it were, two Bodies, and is
reflected also in a double Species; but were it continued in equality, it would
be expressed but as one single Species.

The reason, why an inequality in one continuous body causes a refraction, is,
because every protuberance contracts the Species of an object reflected upon
it, and consequently must represent each of them in a several Species.
Wherefore a Prism does represent the same colors of each side of its angle,
because of the Refraction of the Light arriving through the Inequality of the
Angle.

The ground of the other appearances of a Prism you may easily collect without
any further repetition.

The Sun appears as manifold in the water, as the water is rendered unequal
through undulation.

There is no Refraction without a Reflection; wherefore Refraction is
erroneously divided into simple and mixed, supposing simple to be a Refraction
without a Reflection, which is scarce imaginable.

The eye of man consisting of continuated equal crystalline parts as Membranes
and Humors, does not refract Objects reflected upon it, because of the said
continuous equality, but in case any of the Humors are discontinuated by an
interjacent Body, Objects appear double, because of the Refraction in the eye
happening through the inequality of the said interjacent Body.

CHAP. XXIII. Of Sounds.
1. The Definition of a Sound. That the Collision of two solid Bodies is not
always necessary for to raise a Sound. 2. Whether a Sound be inherent in the
Air, or in the body sounding. The manner of Production of a Sound. 3. Whether a
Sound is propagated through the water intentionally only. That a Sound may be
made and heard under water. 4. That a Sound is a real pluffing up of the Air.
How a Sound is propagated through the Air; and how far. Why a small Sound
raised at one end of a Mast or Beam may be easily heard at the other end. Why
the Noise of the treading of a Troop of Horse may be heard at a far distance.
5. The difference between a Sound and a Light or Color. That it is possible
for a man to hear with his eyes, and see with his ears; likewise for other
Creatures to hear and see by means of their feeling. 6. The difference of
Sounds. Why the Sound of a Bell or Drum cease as soon as you touch them with
your finger. Why an empty Glass causes a greater Sound then if filled with
water. 7. The Reasons of Concords in Music. 8. The Causes of the variation of
Sounds. Why celestial bodies, Rain and Hail do make but little noise in the
Air. 9. How Sounds are restected. How Sounds are intended and remitted. 10. The
manner of Refraction of Sounds. What an undulating Sound is. 11. How a Voice is
formed.


I. SOund is a Quality, whereby a natural body moves the Hearing. This is a
Formal and Relative Definition of a Sound, because we call that a Sound, which
moves the auditory Spirits or internal air of our hearing. Besides this, it
has a fundamental Essence, which is nothing else but a Concussion and
Conquassation of the air; or otherwise, it is the air suddenly and violently
concussed or conquassated, vibrated or rather pluft up by an extrinsick
continuous body, be it hard or sof, liquid or solid, single or double, that is,
between two.

In the first place I might here question, whether a soft or liquid body is apt
to make a Sound, since Aristotle in his 26. T. de Anim. Chap. 8. states a Sound
to be the percussion or collision of two solid hard bodies, and particularly
that soft bodies, as a Sponge, or wool do make no sound.

Notwithstanding this Assertion of Arist. which afterward I shall make appear
to be false, I prove that liquid and soft bodies make a sound: Pour water to
water, and hearken whether they make no sound; beat one Sponge against another,
and listen to their sound; throw one Pack of woollen cloth upon the other, and
hearken whether they make no sound.

II. Next let us enquire whether a sound be a quality inherent in the solid
bodies, or in the air. Not in the solid bodies, because they give very little
sound in a small compass of air, and consequently none without air. Wherefore
it must rather inhere in the air. I prove it, a sound is a Passion, but it is
the air that receives this Passion; ergo the sound is in the air. The passion
is to be krutcht, pluft up, or shaked.

2. A sound sometimes is made when the air is immediately pluft up by one body,
as when we make a noise by switching the air, we hear a sound is made in the
air.

The Definition of a sound asserts it to be a violent and sudden concussion;
for if you do concuss the air, although pent between two hard bodies, softly
and retortedly, it will make no sensible sound, because the air gets out from
between them, by pressing gradually upon its adjacent parts without being pluft
up, or being kept in by them, and so escapes making a noise. But when it is
suddenly and violently pressed upon by one or two bodies, it is forced to
pluffe up, because the adjacent air does not give way fast enough. The air
being pluft up or concussed, is continuated to the ear, by reason that one part
pluffes up another, and so the parts of air lying close in continuation one
upon the other, are soon pluft up and continuated to the auditory air, within
the ears, which it moves likewise with the same degree and property of
pluffing, as the degree of percussion was first made upon it by the property of
the percutient. How air is pluft up, may easily be aprehended, viz. by two
bodies suddenly and violently squeezing out the air, which was between them, by
their sudden collision against one another: For instance, clap your hands hard
together, and you may by the subtle feeling of your face perceive the air pluft
up from between them. Or else a pluffing may also be caused by a smart
impulsion of the parts of air upon one another by a Stick, Board, or any other
single continuous body.

The Reason of a sounds celerity and extent of motion to such an
improportionable distance you may apprehend from the cause of the swiftness of
the lights diffusion treated of in the foregoing Chapt. But withal mark, that
Light and diffusion of colors are by far swifter then sounds, because a Flame
being a most subtle and forcible body, does much swifter obtend the air;
besides the air does rather accur in an obtension to prevent its disruption,
then recede; whereas in making a sound the air is longer in being obtruded or
pluft away from the percutients, because it retrocedes, and the force
percussing does not compass it circularly from all sides, but adversly only.
Hence it is, that at a distance we see a Hatchet driven into Wood long before
we hear the sound of it; or that we see Lightning before we hear the Thunder.

III. I remember, it is an ordinary doubt moved by the Peripateticks, Through
what medium a sound is deferred to the hearing. Their solution is, that a sound
is really deferred through the air, as through a medium, but intentionally
through the water.

This seems to partake of no small absurdity; for many of them do assert, that
a sound is subjectively That is inheres in the air like an accident in its
substance.
in the air; if so; then a sound would be said to be its own medium, which is
absurd; for a medium is ever intended to be a different thing from that, to
which it is a medium Whereas an accident and its substance are not really
different, as has been proved in my Metaph
. Touching their Solution, it is partly false in that they affirm a sound to be
intentionally only deferred through the water: But why more intentionally
through the water then through the air? I will first propose an Instance
inferring water to be capable of receiving a Sound, and then enquire further
into the case. Frogs croaking under the water make a Sound there, which we hear
above the water; likewise we hear the Sound of a Pole hitting against a stone
under water. Certainly none will deny, but that the Sound of these is really
propagated by obtruding the air through its bursting upwards; for we see the
water plainly burst or pluffe upwards a little before we hear the noise made by
a Frog, or Pole; ergo the action of a Sound is real, as well in or through the
water, as through the air. Possibly they may grant me, that the noise made in
the water is a real action, but deny the noise made in the air and propagated
through the water to be real, asserting it to be intentional only. I prove it
to be real. A great sound made in the air does sensibly cause a stream in the
water; ergo, its action is really continued upon the water. But again, a sound
being made in the air, its action is much obtused, because of the improportion
between water being very thick, and air being very thin; so that a great noise
in the air will make but a little noise in the water; and a little noise in the
air will make no sensible noise in the water. But were this audible quality in
the water intentional, then the least sound in the air would be perceptible in
the water: But the one is false, ergo, the other is false also. That a great
sound in the air is audible in the water, yet but very obtusely is testified by
duckers or diverse under the water; the same is seconded by Pliny in his natural
history, 10. b. 70. Chap. attributing hearing and tasting unto fishes, and
relating that fishes have been called together by a certain sound to take their
food. Gellius lib. 16. noct. attic. c. 19. does also recite out of Herodotus,
that Arion, being cast overboard by the Seamen, did through the harmonical
sound of his Music draw the Dolphins to him, whereof one took him upon his
back and carried him safe to a Harbor: Supposing this to be but a story,
nevertheless the allusion of the famous Inventor witnesses that fishes can hear
under the water.

IV. Certainly few will require any proof from me, that a sound is a real
concussion or pluffing of the air, since there is no great sound but it shakes
air, houses and the earth too whereon we stand, and that sometimes to a very
great distance. Some years past it happened that the Magazine of Delf, a Town in
the Low Countries, was blown up, by an accidental fire sighted upon the
gunpowder, the great sound or Concussion of the air caused through this blast
was extended to many miles, insomuch that it was very perfectly perceived at
Amsterdam. The same blast forced open one of the windows of the Chamber where
an Acquaintance of mine lay then at the Hague, with that violence, that its
rebounding against the Wall broke most of the panes. At Dunkirk the sound
raised by blowing up of two or three barrels of Gunpowder killed a boy although
at some distance from it; which accident happened because the Concussion or
pluffing of the air was continuated with that force, that it did in that manner
violently concusse or rather disrupt the animal and vital spirits of the boys
body, which in a manner are (as I said before) a continuous air intermixed with
some contiguities of fire and earth.

I have formerly told you, That the propagation of air or any quality or effect
inherent and impressed in and upon the air reaches no further than its
continuity is extending, and works only upon other continuous bodies: The
reason is, because the same action is continued only upon bodies, which are of
the same nature, and which receive that action in the same manner: Wherefore
air and water being both continuous and united in continuity do receive the
effects acted upon their continuities alike and in the same manner, that is to
say, as far as they are both continuous, and the effects are acted upon their
continuities in a like manner: Saving that the tenuity of the one, and
crassitude of the other, does hinder or facilitate, augment or diminish the
said action thus continuated from one to the other. Further as much as one is
deprived from its continuity by having its body intermixed with contiguous
indivisibles, so much there is detracted from the intenseness of the act
continuated unto it by another continuous body. Thirdly, as the various
incidence of light does alter the face of colors, so does the various
continuation of other various bodies variously qualified in their continuity by
having other contiguous bodies immixt in them alter the property of the sound
continued in them. Lastly, since a sound is an effect impressed upon the
continuity of the air, nothing is more averse to it or drowns it sooner than a
contiguous body. By help of these Theorems you may now resolve the node of
several difficulties touching sounds.

1. Why does earth or fire dead a sound more than water, glass, or paper; or
why is a sound propagable through water, glass, or paper, and is quite deaded
by earth, in a manner that by how much earth or fire That is fire not converted
into a flame.
there is contained in a body, by so much a sound is deaded by that body; and
by how much water or air there is contained in an intermediate body, by so much
a sound is propagated further. The reason is, because a propagated sound is
nothing else but the vibration of air continuously continued upon a continuous
body, to which continuity contiguity is contrary. I will explain it to you by a
conquassation of water, whereby it is concussed into streams, these streams so
concussed are propagated into other more remote streams; but if you interpose a
board near the centrical streams, in will hinder the propagation of the same
streams, because it does divide the continuity of water. Even so it is with
water, glass, and paper, those being continuous do propagate the ayrs quality
in as much as they are continuous. But let us dive a little further into this,
and question whether the continuity of the thick waterish substance of glass,
and of water be the cause of the propagation of this continuity in sounds, or
of the air admitted within the subtle invisible pores of glass, or of both: I
answer, of both, but of the one primarily and perse, of the other secundarily
and per accidens. First, I prove it is of the thick waterish parts; for a great
noise, as perhaps of a Gun, will bend the glass of a window, which glass
through its continuity again communicates the same impression to the adjacent
air.

In little sounds the waterish part of a glass is not moved, but the ayry parts
contained within it, which propagate the same motion into the next adjacent
parts: for it is improbable the motion of every small sound should move so
solid a body as that of glass, unless it were the air contained within its
subtle porosities. Likewise in water it self as it is now, the sound which is
propagated through it or from it, is not always the motion of water it self,
but of the air contained within the water; for it is also improbable that every
slight sound should be sufficient to move the weighty body of water: Besides,
were it not through the air but through the water a sound could not be
propagated in so short a space.

The reason, why the sound caused by a soft percussion of the air upon one end
of a long Beam, or of a Mast, is so readily heard by another applying his ear
to the other end of it, is, because that sound is propagated by the percussed
air slyding down along the Surface of the said Beam or Mast, not because the
sound is propagated through the internal continuity of the Beam or Mast; for
that were impossible for the sound to reach to the other end through so thick a
body in so short a time, or by so gentle a percussion. But were the sound made
by the force of a great Hammer, it is not improbable but the sound would pass
through the body of it.

The noise of a Troop of Horse marching over a plain hard sandy ground may be
heard at a far distance, because the sound is continuately propagated by the
air impelled along the Surface of the earth, there being no contiguous body
interposed to dead its sound or interrupt its continuation; for otherwise any
length of grass or quantity of corn standing in the fields between the hearers
and the horses would interrupt and dead the sound. The same reason may be
applied to resolve one, why a sound made in the air by one upon the water is
heard from a further distance, than if made upon the land: because the earth
being contiguous does somewhat dead and interrupt the propagation of a sound;
but the water being continuous and smooth does rather further it, because it
does slide and reflect the sound from her, and so makes it greater and swifter
than otherwise it would be if propagated through the air alone.

Water attenuated by the air makes a real sound to those that are under water,
because it concusses the auditory air.

V. This plussing up of air in a sound is distinguished from the obtension of it
by light, 1. In that in obtensions the air moves to the body obtending, whereas
in plussing the air moves from the percutient. 2. A plussing is a more course
action, whereas the other is much more subtle; for they are both motions almost
of the same kind differing only in tenuity and crassitude: Whence I infer, That
there is no other difference between the Optic and Auditory spirits or air,
than that the Optic air is by far subtiller, the other more course, both
having Membranes to qualify their Objects. Hence let us examine whether it be
possible for a man to see or discern a voice or sound with his eyes, or to hear
a color. A man, who has all his senses well qualified, if he make trial of
the query will bring in his verdict for the impossibility of it. Wherefore let
us propose the doubt in a more probable state, to wit, whether a man, whose
Optic spirits be thick and his Membranes thin and somewhat denser is capable
of perceiving and discerning a voice or sound through his sight. 2. Whether a
man, whose Auditory spirits are very thin and Membrane more thick and
transparent than ordinary, be capable of perceiving colors and light. I affirm
it, and will make it appear to you by experience and reason. I have often been
told that the Constable of Castile his brother could perfectly discern sounds
and voices by his eyes. How this came to pass I shall easily demonstrate, by
considering first the disposition of his ocular Membranes and Optic spirits.
The Membranes of his eyes were somewhat thin and course, not overmuch
transparent, standing deep in his head. Whence this happened I do farther explain
to you; He was deaf in such a degree, that the greatest Thunder could not be
perceived by him when his Eyes were shut. This deafness arose from a total
coalition of his Auditory passage, and want of a Tympanum. The matter of this
Tympanum was converted by the plastic virtue in his formation to the
constitution of the membranes of his Eyes, whence the said membranes appeared
deadish, course, and skinny; in short, the Tympanum of his ear was in a manner
transferred to his eyes: His Optic spirits must then of a necessity be thicker
or less thin than ordinary for to be proportionable to that membrane, for all
parts of the body are informated with spirits proportionable to their
consistency, and in effect their modus consistentiae is caused from the modus
consistentiae spirituum fixorum. His eyes stood deep in his head, and so
thereby framed a grove, wherein the sound was congregated. In fine his eyes,
were the greater half eyes, and the less half ears. That all this is agreeable
his other acts did testify; because his sight was imperfect, he could not see
at a distance; Objects unless they were great and lustrous could not be
perfectly discerned by him; on the other side his hearing through his eyes was
by far more imperfect, a moderate sound he did not perceive; a loud sound or
voice he was alone sensible of. Since then he was capable of perceiving sounds
through his eyes, no wonder if he learned his speech from thence; for speech is
nothing else but an ecchoing of a voice spoken by another and perceived by
spirits disposed to receive its impression, by expressing the same impression
again by the tongue in the same manner as it was impressed. Now his speech
being very imperfect and unequal, did testify that the voices perceived by his
eyes were imperfect and unequal. That it is possible for an Animal to see
colors with its ears is evident in a Mole, whose ears not being very deep,
but its Tympanum somewhat transparent, is thereby disposed to distinguish light
from darkness, and one color from another; that it perceives colors and light
is granted by all, which it cannot do by its eyes; for it has none, ergo, it
must be by its ears alone, which as I have showed are disposed to seeing almost
as well as to hearing. But you may object, That Authors do assign eyes to a
Mole, which are imagined by them to be in some places upon their heads, where
the skin seems somewhat thinner and glabrous. I answer, That this is a great
mistake, for were those places distinated for their eyes they would be
pervious, which they are not; for underneath the common bone of their head is
obducted. Besides this of the Mole I have heard of men, who could discern light
by their ears.

Let us still proceed in searching further into the niceties of founds and
colors, and examine whether it be possible for an animal to perceive colors
and sounds by its tact. Certainly yes; for if its Membranes be moderately thin
and transparent, and the spirits fixed in them be moderately course,
questionless it will see colors by its tact. Flies, Fleas, Worms, etc. do
perceive colors and light: For Flies in the day time we see they fly to and
rest themselves in a definite place, without hitting against any opposite body
beyond their aim: Or again, if one goes to catch a Fly, the noise which the
hand makes by concussing the air in moving to her, scares the Fly and makes
her slay away. The first instance is an example of a flies perceiving colors,
objects, and light, which must needs be perceived by her tact, since it has no
other visible eyes, although looked for in a magnifying glass. The last
testifies its perceiving of noise by the tact, because it does equally perceive
it from all parts; but had it ears, it would perceive it more from one part
than another. The same is also apparent in Fleas, Worms, and other insects.
Fishes, it is certain, hear a sound under water, but not by their ears, for
they have none; but by their eyes, which are almost equally disposed to hearing
and seeing: More then this, I believe that colors and sounds are smelt and
tasted by some Creatures.

VI. The reason, why so many several kinds of objects are perceived by one
faculty in some insects, is, because their bodies are so little, that it is
impossible secundum quid that nature should have destined distinct Organs for
the perceiving of each object, and therefore those several faculties are
confounded into one.

The difference of sounds is taken from their quantity, which is threefold:
Longitude, Latitude, and Profundity. The Longitude of a sound is the duration
of it. The Latitude is its sharpness and smoothness. The thickness is its
Altitude and Profundity. A sound is said to be long or short from its
Longitude. A long sound is a sound continued in length or in the same tone; so
holding your finger long upon the key of an Organ, makes it to be long; if you
keep down the key but a little while, it makes but a short sound. The cause of
a long sound is the keeping the air in the same concussion or pluffing. Hence
it is that as long as you keep your finger upon the key of a pair of Virginals
the sound does last, because you keep the air up in one and the same
concussion, but as soon as you withdraw your finger, the sound vanishes
presently after; because the cloth, which is fastened at the top of the Jack,
by touching the string does stay its concussing motion by interrupting its
continuity, and by that means the air is quieted.

The same reason resolves, why the sound of a Bell, or of a Lute string is
shortened or presently deaded as soon as you touch either with your finger:
Namely, because the air of the Bell being vibrated by a concutient its
propagation is shortened and deaded by dividing its continuity, and staying the
propagating sounding air through interposing a contiguous body, whereby the air
is relaxed and driven back.

The reason, why sounding upon one side of a Drum, the motion of that sound is
prolonged to the other side, is, because the air is not stopped by any contiguous
body, but holding your finger upon either side the sound is forthwith shortened.

Why is the sound of an empty drinking Glass more prolonged, than if it were
filled up with water? because the water being thicker and heavier is not so
easily percussed as the air.

A sound is said to be smooth or harsh from its crassitude, which depends upon
the levor and asperity, equality and inequality of the percutient, and upon its
smartness and softness in concussing.

From its profundity and Altitude a sound is termed base or course, and trebble
or high, or equal and unequal; thus they say la is high and fine; ut course and
base. Sounds are termed equal, if they are of the same profundity or altitude,
and so unisons are called equal; all other intervals of sounds are called
unequal, as a Diapason, Diapente, a Diatesseron, a third, a sixth, and a second,
etc.

Notwithstanding this inequality and rice, there is between several tones from
one to eight a concord observable, which does very much affect and please the
ear; the cause of it has appeared to be very abstruse to many, which in effect
is obvious enough. A Diapason strikes a sweet concord, because that distance of
tone does affect the ear; the ear is affected with it, because sounds of that
distance move it in such a manner, as that the one sets off the other very
much, in the same manner as four sets off a sweet taste, or as a white sets off
a black, or a Summers heat of the body is set off by coming between a pair of
fine cool sheets; or as the heat and drought, happening when a man has made
himself hot and dry by running, is much set often by a draught of cool drink. So
that you may take notice, that there (...) extreme Concords belonging to every
sense in particular; not only so, but you may also observe intermediate
Concords between their Objects; as a black Suit is well set off by a pair of
Scarlet Hose, and is pleasing to the eye; this is a mediate concord between the
extremes, namely white and black, as a Diapente is a middle concord to a
Diapason. A black Suit is a concord to a Pearl-colour Stockin; so is a Diapason
a Concord to a Diatessaron. Moreover there are also Discords in Colors and
Objects of other senses, as well as in sounds. As a Seventh is a discord to an
Unison; so is a pair of Brown Milled Hose to a black Suit, or a pair of black
Hose to a Gray Suit.

In fine, you may perceive as many discords and concords between the objects of
all the other Senses, as between Sounds. Hence I infer, that the same Reason,
why a pair of black Hose is a Discord to a light Gray suit (for most peoples
fight is disaffected with such an opposition) or why Vinegar is a Concord to
Sugar (for the Palate is as much affected with their Concord, as the Hearing
with a Concord of Sounds) will prove satisfactory to the disquisition upon the
cause of Discords and Concords between Sounds. The reason of Concords in
Colors is, because such a distance or opposition of color does set off
another (according to that Maxim, Contraria juxta se invicem posita magis
elucescunt;) Whereas were this distance but of one degree, it would rather
detract from one another, as being defective in setting one another off. So a
little sour added to much sweet makes an unpleasant taste. Likewise in Sounds an
Unison and a Second make Discords, because there is too little Treble or
altitude in a Second to respond to the deep Base of an Unison, and hence you
may easily conceive the Grounds and Causes of all Concords and Discords. The
cause of the different sounds of Trebles and Bases, is the thickness of the
String or percutient vibrating the air in such a degree of obtuseness, or such
a degree of thinness of the String percussing the air acutely: or thus, the
Bubble which a course String plufs up must needs be thicker then that of a fine
one.

VIII. Sounds vary according to the qualification of the percutient in
consistency, bigness and action. A percutient being thick, makes a thick Sound;
so the Base String of an Instrument makes a thick or course Sound. A thin
percutient beats a thin or sharp sound; hence a small string sounds sharply. So
that according to the greater or lesser courseness or thickness, thinness or
sharpness of a percutient, the Sound is made more or less course and sharp. The
rarity of a percutient or its density cause little or no noise: if any, a very
dumb one, because the air is obtruded by neither of them, but is only
percolated through them. A great percutient makes a great noise, a small one
little. The percussion of a percutient being continuous, or interrupted, slow
or quick, smart or feeble, raises a continuous or interrupted, slow or quick,
smart or feeble Noise.

The Heavens, that is, the fiery bodies, moving with a rapid motion through or
with their own Region of fire, make some noise, but so little, that it would
scarce be audible, supposing a man were near to them. They make some little
noise, because they being bodies somewhat continuous, and obtruding that little
air, which is admitted to the fire in some measure, they must consequently make
a noise, but such as is soon deaded through the contiguity of the fire. Among
these Bodies, the Moon makes the greatest noise, because its body is more
continuous, and its situation is nearest to the region of the air. Supposing
two celestial bodies should extraordinarily meet and dash against one another,
they would make an indifferent audible noise, because the peregrine air being
thereby more pent, its obtrusion must necessarily be the greater. A Stella
cadens (or a falling Star) yields no noise, because the air gives way in it
self as fast as the other can make way down; but did it fall down swifter then
the air could give way, then of necessity it must obtrude it, and raise a
sound; or did it fall upon air being pent by it and another Body, it would do
the same with more efficacy.

Clouds, Rain and Hail make a small noise in the air, although not very
sensible, because the air is loose and free, whereby it gives way: but where
ever it is pent by them and other Bodies, they raise a sound; hence Hail and
Rain make a noise, when they shroud the air between themselves and the earth;
hence it is also, why Streams or a Channel of water is not heard, unless where
it beats smartly against it self, or against shallows of Gravel or Pebble.

Focal fire glowing or any thing within it, makes no noise in it self, unless
its body being rendered more continuous in a flame is beated against the air,
or the air is obtruded against it by another continuous Body; as by a fan or
wind out of Bellows.

A hissing noise is made in the air, when it is smartly percussed without being
pent by any other Body, but by its own parts and the percutient. Hence it is
that a Bullet shot or the switching of the air with a Switch make a hissing
noise; but their noise is much altered, where the air is pent by it and another
solid body.

A quaking noise, as of an Earthquake, or the quavering upon an Instrument,
proceeds from the interruption and repetition of the percussion. By how much
the more the air is pent from all parts, the greater and violenter sound it
makes. Hence it is, that the noise of a Gun, or of any thing bursting is of
that lowdness. This also proves a cause why a soft whispering, or blast of wind
makes a great sound improportionable to so soft a percussion, in a Trunk, or
any other close, round long passage. Hence a Trumpet, or a Hunters Horn do make
so great a noise, and is so far propagated.

IX. A sound is either reflexe or refracted. A reflexe sound is, when it is
propelled against a continuous body, by which it is repulsed, or whence it does
rebound; so that the reflection of a Sound is nothing else, but a rebounding of
it from a continuous body.

Sounds acquire an increase or a louder noise from their rebounding, in a like
manner as Light is intended by its reflection. The greater this reflection is,
the greater noise it makes. The greatest Reflection is, when a Sound is
reflected by a circular reflecting continuous body; because the sound being
circularly propagated, (for a noise made in the open air is heard round about)
is equally reflected from all parts; and its parts do as it were reflect back
again against one another, whereby the sound is majorated to its greatest
intention. Hence it is that Chapels being circularly rooft reflect a great
Sound, and were their Bottom also circular, the sound would be by far more
intended. By the way, take notice that an Echo is not a reflection alone of a
sound, neither is it caused by it alone; for all grant, that there is a great
reflection of a Sound in Chapels, and yet there is no Echo.

All sorts of Metals formed into a Concave, as Pels, Bowls made of metal, and
all sorts of drinking Glasses give a great sound (for their tinging noise is
nothing else, but a great intended reflext quaking noise) because the percussed
sound is reflext circularly within upon the connuated parts of the said Metals
and Glasses: From the same reason it is, that all hollow continuated bodies, as
most sorts of Instruments, viz. Virginals, Viols, Lutes, etc. make so great and
improportionable a sound, to so small a percussion. A man would imagine, that
the sound caused by striking of a String of an Instrument, should come all from
within the Instrument, and that there were no sound at all above; but it is
otherwise: It Is true, the greater sound is protruded from within; nevertheless
there is a sound also without, but it being the lesser, is overcome and drowned
by the protrusion of the greater sound from within. This is evident in a Metal
being struck or sounded in an upper Chamber, sometimes happening to make a
greater sound in the next Room underneath it, (provided that the lower Room be
more concave, and that the Metal do stand upon the Boards) but notwithstanding
there is some little sound in the same Room above.

As a sound is majorated by these forementioned occasions, so it may also be
minorated by their contraries.

Besides all this, there is also a contraction or abbreviation of a Sound,
whereby the Species of a great sound is fully perceived, collected and
contracted into a small space; and this is only possible in long hollow Passages
and Pipes, and often the longer they are, the more and plainer the sound is
contracted, provided that their length is not too far extending: Hence it is,
why the Species of a great sound is contracted and plainly perceived by the
ear, and is yet more and plainer contracted, when a man holds his hand being
inverted like a Trunk before it. The (...) of this Theorem is the same with the
(...) of the contraction of a visible Object upon a Rotundity.

As a remote visible Object can be rendered more visible by the help of
magnifying Glasses, so can a remote audible Object be rendered more audible by
majorating or contracting Instruments, as Sarabatanes, or long Trunks, etc.

Refraction of a Sound is, when it is reflected upon several Cavities or
continuous concaves. Wherefore every concave contracting the sound in a
determinate Species, there must necessarily be as many sounds reflected and
rendered, as there are perfect Cavities; this is otherwise called the Ecchoing
or resonance of Sounds. Compare this with the refraction of Light and Colors,
the Reasons of both being the same.

An undulating sound is an imperfect Refraction, and is when a sound is but
half ecchoed or resounded, arising from the imperfection and obtuseness of the
Cavity; for the sides of a perfect Cavity are required to be acute for to
divide the Sound from its next cavity, or for to make a complete Refraction.
This resonance of Sounds does only rebound to a certain distance and
determinate Sphere, within which compass if the ear be seated, it may hear the
Echo. The Sound being propagated circularly may be ecchoed all about the
Circumference; wherefore two men standing in several places may each hear a
distinct and several Echo of one and the same Sound, and according to the
difference of the Situation of the Cavities, the one shall perceive the Echo,
and the other shall not.

Many do imagine that the multiplicity of Resonances in Sounds is caused by an
Echo upon an Echo; but erroneously, it being rather to be imputed to the
diversity and multiplicity of perfect Cavities; which although it be not
impossible, yet it happens very seldom. In many pillared round Churches a loud
voice does resonate by several Eccho's near upon at the same time, which if it
happened through an Echo upon an Echo, their motion would be much slower one
after the other. The same is perceptible among some Bills, whose several Valleys
being perfect cavities, sometimes make a multiplicity of Eccho's. The reason,
why one Echo is frequently heard after the other, is, because of the greater
remoteness of the Cavities, which greater remoteness is also the cause of the
minoration of the sound. The Chapel at Pont Charenton refracts or eccho's a
Sound sixteen times, which is caused through sixteen perfect Cavities
constituted by the two Rows of Pillars built of each side of the said Chapel.

We read also of the seven times answering Echo of the Gallery of Olympia, a
City in Greece, and thence was called Heptaphonos, or returning seven voices;
which was effected through the refraction of the Sound between the Pillars.
There was also a famous Echo within Cyzecum a City of Bithynia, returning a
Sound many times. Lucretius in Lib. 4. speaks of another Echo, which
multiplied a voice seven times. Sex etiam aut septem loca vidi reddere voces,
Unam cum faceres. --


XI. Hitherto has been discoursed on natural Sounds, it remains I should add
a word or two touching Animal sounds or voices; which are either inarticulate,
as such as are common to Beasts and Men; or articulate, which in their
perfection are only proper to men. The articulation is nothing else but a
continuated unequal Sound, being moderated in Longitude, Latitude and
Profundity, through the help of the Lungs, Throat, Tongue, Pallat, Lips and
Teeth: all these serve to pent and screw the air according to any intended
modulation. If the throat be very hollow, and that the Uvula be wanting, the
Sound reflecting against that imperfected Hollowness makes its voice hollow and
loud. There cannot be any sensible echo of the voice within the mouth,
although a perfect hollowness were supposed to be there, because there must be
allowed a proportionable distance, otherwise a sound must rebound again into
and against it self, whereby its ecchoing is drowned; this is the reason, why a
voice or sound does not echo, when it is made too near to a perfect Cavity.

We will shut up this Discourse of Audibles with the mentioning of one absurd
Question generally moved by the Peripatet. viz. Whether a sound can be made in
a vacuum, that is, where there is no air, they conceiving that a sound is made
immediately by the percussion of two solid bodies one against the other: the
Absurdity is obvious, since it has so evidently been demonstrated that sound
is nothing but a passion of the Air.

I. A Taste (Sapor) is a quality, whereby a mixed being moves the tasting
faculty.

The tasting Faculty is inherent immediately in the fixed animal spirits, and
mediately in the influent ones of the Tongue and Palate. These Spirits are in
two degrees thicker then the auditory spirits, there being the olfactive
spirits intercedent, differing but one degree in thickness from the said
auditory spirits.

The object of this faculty is required to be respondent to it in consistency;
wherefore the faculty, viz. the Spirits being dense and thick, the Objects of
the taste do move the same faculty by a greater density and thickness then those
of visibles and audibles. Otherwise if the Object be thinner and rarer then is
requisite, it is incapable of moving the taste; hence it is, that we cannot taste
air, or warmth proceeding from fire. That, which is thick, moves the taste by a
kind of continuous compression of the spirits in the tongue: thus fair water
affects the taste, which the more ayry and thin it is affects the tongue the
more. Water being tempered with Spirits, makes a kind of a sharp and brisk
taste; for instance, Wine. Dense bodies move the Palate by a contiguous
compression, and therefore make a more distinct and forcible taste. Summarily,
taste is nothing else but the discerning of the several temperatures of mixed
bodies effecting several passions in the tongue and upon its gustative faculty,
which several passions are said to be several tastes. Hence it is also obvious
that the quality, whereby a taste moves the gustative faculty, is nothing but
its action, whereby it acts distinctly in several Subjects, wherein a
different gustable quality is inherent.

Since the Gustative Spirits are deeply latent within a porous and Spongie
body, nothing can move the taste, unless it be of that thinness or small
quantity, as that it may pass the pores of the tongue, the passing of which
subtilities waterish Moisture does very much facilitate, which proves in stead
of a Vehicle to them, and makes those passages slippery. Hence it is, that no
great bodies have any taste, unless they be first attrited and diminisht by the
teeth, and the more they be diminisht, the more their taste becomes perceptible.
Dry bodies are not so gustable as when they are a little moistened, whereby
they reserate the pores of the tongue and procure a passage to the seat of the
taste.

II. As many different ways as objects move the taste, or cause several
passions in it, so many different tastes there be. That, which does only gently
shake the taste, and as it were does but tickle it, is sweet, and deriving from
a temperateness, yet so as that water is abounding in it. That, which does
sensibly alterate the taste, is an intermediate sapour; that, which does most
alterate it, so as it may not pervert the faculty, is an extreme sapour.
Extreme sapours depend upon the greatest predominance of each Element in a
several mixed body, which being four do also constitute four extreme tastes. 1.
A fiery hot taste, as in Pepper, Ginger, etc. 2. An earthy taste. 3. A waterish
taste. 4. An ayry taste, not such as Theophrastus calls a fat taste, like there
is in oil. The rest are intermediate, as bitter, acerbe, acid, and salt, for
that is a taste mixed out of a waterish and ayry taste.

Peripateticks assert, that tastes for to move the gustable faculty are to be
immediately applied to it; and there they assert, that tastes are only real
among all the sensible qualities. But this does not always hold true; for
tastes may be communicable through a medium, (and if the air is at any time to
be allowed to be a medium, it is sometimes in tastes, and always in odors) to
wit, the air, as Apothecaries do all testify; for when they are powdering, or
a peeling of Colocynthis, its bitter taste does very sensibly reach their
tongue.

III. A smell or scent is a quality or action, whereby a mixed body moves the
olfactive faculty. The difference between this and the gustable faculty is none
other, but that the one consists in a degree of a finer and thinner consistency
of spirituous air; and the same difference is between their objects, viz. a
taste is of a thicker body than a scent, in manner that the scent is too subtle
to strike the gustable faculty, and a sapour is too thick to strike the
olfactive faculty; wherefore that, which through its subtility passes the
sense of taste does thereby reach to the sense of smelling, moving its faculty
withal. It is th^n apparent; That the objects of both these senses are the
same, differing only in subtilty of body, and that they are nothing but
temperaments of bodies comminuted and moving the said powers immediately, yet
not so, but that the subtiler parts for to move the sense, are requisite to be
separated from the courser, and more then that, each needs a Vehicle or a
medium for to be carried and directed through the subtle passages to the deep
latent sensory. The vehicle of tastes is water (to which spittle and drink are
equipollent,) as being through its thickness respondable to receive so thick
and course an object; a thinner vehicle, as the air, could not receive it,
because it is too thin to support it. The vehicle of scents is air, as being
through its thinness proportionated to receive and convey such subtle bodies;
were this vehicle thicker, it would through its gravity expel or express bodies
of that subtility, that smells are of. You may here observe the depravate
Judgments of the Peripateticks concerning the mediums of sensible objects,
where they ought to grant a medium as to scents and tastes, they withhold it,
where they should allow no medium, there they grant it; as to audibles and
visibles. I stated temperaments of bodies to be the objects of sense, by which
you are to understand the subtiller and volatick parts of substances reduced to
a certain degree of temperament, and obtaining certain virtues of acting: So
that hereby I do not intend any quality distinct from a substance for the
objects of sense, but real bodies so qualified as to move sense; where (mark)
qualities are not really distinguished from their bodies, but really
identificated with them in the concrete (although in the abstract they are
distinguished ratione;) for what is a quality in a body else but a body
qualified? Wherefore the action performed through the quality of a body is not
to be taken as if the body were one thing, and the quality another, but as one,
and that action proceeds from the body qualified; of this I have discoursed
more at large in my Metaphysics.

IV. Smells do nourish no more than tastes nourish the animal spirits; none
doubts but that neither nourishes the solid or humoral parts, because of their
unsutableness in consistency and temperament. Wherefore although some are said
to have sustained their life for a long time through smells alone, as it is
recorded of Democritus, who sustained his life three days through the smell of
hot bread, and of others, who are said to have lived many days upon the sent
of Tobacco chawed, or smoaked, yet this is not to be understood as if their
parts had been really nourished, for they grew leaner and leaner; but their
life was maintained by keeping the spirits alive, which is performed by scents,
that do gently stir them, as hot bread, rose water, etc. As for Tobbacco, that
maintains life accidentally also, by taking away the sharpness of the hungry
spirits knawing upon the stomach, and obtusing and thickning them through its
sulphuriousness, and by attracting slegme to the stomach from the head and
other parts, which the stomach in time of need turns into nutriment; yet some
question, whether they do not nourish the animal and vital spirits, since they
are so apt to revive the spirits in faintness and other weaknesses. I grant
they revive the spirits, but whether this happens through stirring up of the
spirits, or through nourishing or increasing them may be doubted. Certainly,
not by increasing of the spirits, because that smells are crude exhalations,
differing from the vital and animal spirits; wherefore they ought first to be
concocted and fitted for assimulation by gradual elaborations of the Stomach,
Liver, and Heart, and must be purified through the same members from their
suliginous excrements. Who would say, that the spirits of Vinegar should revive
through nourishing the spirits, and not through their exciting or irritating of
the said spirits? Certainly, such sharp spirits do decline from a capacity of
nourishing the spirits of the brain, but nevertheless are very fit to revive by
stirring and moving of them: In a like manner do pinching and rubbing of the
skin revive in a swoun, not by nourishing of the spirits, but by moving and
stirring of them up. Likewise crying loud into the ears, and holding a bright
light to the eyes opened by force, does as soon revive and recall swouning
patients as any thing; but assuredly the working of these is by exciting and
stirring the spirits, and not by nourishing of them.

The more thin the olfactive Membranes and nerves are, and the more subtle the
spirituous olfactive air is, the further odours or scents are perceived: But
then it is requisite, that those objects, which are to move such a sense should
be more subtle, because of being proportionated to the faculty: for if they are
course, they will exceed the perception of such a scent; hence it is, that
those, who excel all others in exquisiteness of scent cannot attain to the
smelling a thick smell near by, unless they go so far off as that those thick
exhalations by moving through the air may be grinded less, and so be the better
fitted for to strike the olfactive faculty: hence it is then that a Vulture
being blinded and placed suddenly in a Room where dead stinking flesh is, shall
not find it through his sent, although his smelling is the most exquisite of
any living creature (according to the usual Verse: Nos aper auditu, linx visu,
simia gustu,
Vultur odoratu praecellit, araneatactu.
A Boar in hearing, a Linx in sight, a Vulture in his smell.
An Ape in taste, a Spider in feeling do us far excel.)


Because the scents being thick are not thin enough to strike his subtle
smell; but then again, he shall perceive those scents at the greatest distance,
where these thick scents are so much subtiliated through the length of passage,
that there he perceives them very sensibly, as being fitted to his scent. The
smell of a Tallow-Chandlers shop does little offend or move our olfactive
power, when we are in the shop, yea, not at all, but at our first approach
before we come near to it, the smell may direct any one thither blindfold.
Neither do Dogs or Hogs smell thick scents, as of excrements or other rotten
stinking smells of corrupted flesh, when they are near to them; for did they,
they would certainly abhor them; yet it is certain they smell them at a great
distance, but then that smell at a distance is not a stinking smell to them,
but sweet and pleasant, for otherwise they would not be so much enticed by
them; for although such objects stunk near by, through their thick pernicious
and strong motion, yet through the grinding of the air they are mollified, and
their putrid temperature is laid and equalized, and their stink is quite taken
away: this appears in Musk, Civet, or Ambergreece, which if held close to the
Nosthrils strike as unpleasing a stink as excrements, but again how fragrant
and sweet a scent do they emit at a distance? Even so it is with the scent of
Excrements to Dogs and Hogs. A Dog scents a Bitch a great way off, although
locked up, without seeing of her, and apprehends the scent under her Tail to be
no ill scent: Wherefore I say, That in many, if not in most scents, that, which
smells sweet to a man, sents stinking to most beasts, and that, which sents
stinking to us, smells sweet to most beasts. It will not be difficult now to
give a reason, why and how a Dog winds the scent of a Hare at so great a
distance; it is, because there are some exhalations or evaporations emanated
through the habit of a Hares body, and especially of her belly and inguina,
inhering in the ground and in the air near about it, over which the Hare has
taken her flight, the which although they be very subtle and thin, yet they do
sensibly and perfectly move the olfactive power of the Dog: this sent is as
entirely pleasing to the Dog as the sight of his eagerness in pursuit pleases
the Hunters, and so they are both equally enticed to the pursuit of the Hare.

Fishes are said by Aristotle Lib. 4 de histor. animal. to have a smell, in
that they are enticed by the smell of food cast to them into the water. I do
wonder, where he found out their Organ of smelling, for my part I could never
discern it, nor any body else. It is true, Fish does perceive the taste of food
through its continuous dissolution through the water by their Gills or Palate,
at a great distance (because the particles of the food are diducted into a
large extent) which viz. The palate and gills.
being the more exquisite do serve them for to taste and to smell.

V. That, which does gently shake or move our olfactive air, is only that,
which we call a sweet smell, and therein the sent of man is much pleased.
Wherefore sents being of a different temperature, all smells do not equally
please all men; or every Creature is most pleased in different objects: So most
beasts, as Theophrastus writes, are pleased with the smell of a Panther, and
therefore do all follow him. Cats are delighted by the smell of a Mouse or a
Rat, which she ketches in the dark more through guide of her sent, (she having
a most exquisite sent as appears by her finding the Larder, or victuals hidden
in any part of the house or room) than of her sight. Flies are delighted in the
sent, or rather taste (for they have no organ particularly destined for
smells,) of honey.

That, which does most offend and almost pervert our sent, is a stinking smell.
This offense of sent is various in degrees according to the degrees of the
ingrate motion of smells, and thence according to the property of those
degrees, we specify and distinguish smells, whose kinds are named by the same
names that tastes are, as being consentaneous to them not only in the thing it
self, but also in name: viz. they are either fiery sharp as Pepper, bitter,
salt, acid or sour, acerbous, putrid, which subvert and offend the sent, and
are various according to the subject, whence they are emitted, and do receive
their names also thence, so we say it smells like a carrion, like excrements,
like piss, like stinking fish, like rank meat; it smells as if it were musty,
etc.

As several scents are offensive to man, so are beasts offended with several
sents, which they do naturally flee, because they are dissentaneous to their
olfactive ficulty. So Flies are offended with the smoke of Brimstone (rathe I
suppose because it choaks them;) Serpents with the sent of Galbanum, and Mise
with the sent of an Asses claw burnt.

Some people will say, That the Plague does often carry a sent with it not unlike
to the smell of a mellow apple, or according to others like the scent of May
flowers. It is certain that infected houses do smell so, because they are moist
and dampish, and thence putrid, and therefore the fitter to receive the venom
of pestilent air, but it is not a sent, which the Plague brings along with it,
but which it finds in the house; for I have often smelt such scents in garden
houses, which proceeded from the dampness of the boards. The Plague is so
subtle a venom, that it passes the grosseness of man's sent, and therefore
cannot be smelt; nevertheless it is sented by Dogs, Cats, Flies, and other
creatures, which are so much offended by it, that they usually flee such
houses. I have been in several Towns, where the Plague did rage very violently,
but when ever I was occasioned to go into strange houses, I generally took
notice whether there were any Dog or Cat in the house, or whether I could see
any Flies about the Room, which if I did I was the better satisfied. Let me
tell you, could the Plague be sented by man, the Plague would be no plague; for
as I told you, That which does move our sent must be of a certain essential
thickness, which, if concommitant to the venom of the Plague, were impossible
that it should work such pernicious and potent effects, unless it were of so
subtle a body, that it should flee our sent. Hence I do also infer, that it is
impossible for a man to be poisoned through a sent, because if a thing be so
thick as to move out sent, it is impossible it should produce such an effect in
that thickness. Probably you may object, that the Italians have attained to a
way of poisoning men by the smell of perfumed Gloves, or by a sent impressed
upon the inside of a Letter, which if a man do open, and receive the sent of it
through his nosthrils, it will certainly kill him. In the first place it is
doubtful, whether they have attained to that perfection of cowardly murder
through sents; if they have not, questionless their Genius does lead enough
that way, and it is more for want of industry, knowledge, and skill, than
inclination; however it being possible enough, and supposing it to be so, I
answer, That it is not the smell does kill a man, but something, which being of
that subtility that it flees the sent, is mixed with some perfume, wherewith
the forementioned gloves are perfumed: The like answer does dissolve the
objection of poison contained within the Letter.

VI. The coursest of all the senses is the Tact, or feeling faculty, to which
the coursest kind of objects without any comm^nution are appropriated: So that
the courser an object is the more tangible it proves: This must also be applied
immediately to the organ, because no medium is course enough to carry or convey
it to the sensory. Had the Peripateticks proposed that question here, which
they moved concerning seeing and hearing, viz. Whether we are capable of
sensation in a vacuum, they would have showed themselves to have had some skill
in the matter: But let us refer the same question to the sense of feeling,
and question, Whether it be possible to feel a thing in a Vacuum. I answer
affirmatively, What should hinder the Tact from feeling, supposing the object
to be applied to the sensory? For it needs no air for its vehicle.

VII. Themistius, Averrhoes, AEgidius, Jandunus, Apollinaris, Marcellus,
Avicenna, Albertus Magnus, Cardan, and others do seem to state as many
different kinds of feeling, as there are different objects, that do move the
Tact differently, according to which rule they may allow almost infinite kinds
of feeling. Their mistake is gross; for according to the same rule, there
should be as many kinds of seeing, hearing, etc. but this is absurd. The case
is this: It is not every distinct act or object, which, causes a difference in
the faculty, for one faculty may perceive many different kinds of objects, and
yet not be multiplied in its faculty, but remain one and the same: look in my
first book of Phil. and in the Metaph. where I have insisted more largely upon
this point, and illustrated how a faculty may be one formally, and manifold
materially.

Scaliger Exerc. CCCXXXVI. d. 3. is so much taken with his Ve^ereal
Titillation, that he honors it with the name of a sixth sense. Alas his
subtillity could hardly reach to maintain the dignity of it. What? Because it
pleased his fancy, therefore it must be called a sixth sense. Or did he
specify it from the common tact, because it was proper to the Membranes of the
Genitals? then upon the same account the tact of his head is specifically
distinguished from the tact of his knee: or is it, because it is a titillation?
No certainly, for every sensible part of the body may be tickled; but the
subtiller the part is, the more exquisite, acute, and piercing the titillation
is, and therefore no wonder, if those parts being circumvested with thin
membranes, being of a most exquisite sense, perceive so acute and piercing a
titillation.

Man is generally cried up to have the most exquisite tact of all Creatures;
but why should he be said to be only excellent in feeling and not in all his
other senses? For he judges more distinctly of all sensibles, than other
creatures, although he does not perceive them at such a distance as other
animals, the excellency of sensation not consisting in remoteness of its action.

VIII. Tangibility then is a quality, whereby a mixed body moves the Tact. The
principality of the tact consists in a thick course spiritous air, the moving
of which is the raising of a feeling. It is moved by being diducted either by
depression or weight, or any other thick continuous diduction: So that whatever
is thin, light, or rare does effuge the sense of the tact; hence it is, that
the air, thin vapors, exhalations, or spirits, are not immediately felt. That
which does gently stir and quaver these tangent spirits is said to feel
pleasing and delightful: Hence it is that kissing seems to feel so pleasing to
many, because that happening to a thin part, being withal of an exquisite
feeling, where the spirits being gently stirred and quavered by the application
of other lips does cause a delightful feeling. That this is so, is testified by
most, who kiss for a delight, in that they do at that instant of the
application of lips feel a creeping quaking spirit in their lips. The same
delightful feeling happens also to a Dog, applying his chops to a Bitches
tail. A soft object does gently stir the tangent spirits of the extremities of
the fingers, and is perfectly pleasing, and therefore many men love to handle
and feel boys and girls cheeks.

That, which does so much diduct the tactile spirits as to divide and burst
them, does subvert the tact and causes a pain. As for the other differences of
tangibles, they are taken from the degree and property of raising feeling in
tangibles; so we say, a thing feels heavy, light, hot, cold, moist, dry, fiery,
waterish, earthy, hard, soft, rough, smooth, etc. the description of all which
I do omit, as having set them down above.

A gentle titillation is one of the delightful tangibles, which gentleness, if
otherwise exceeding and inferring violence, does become painful; as appears in
the French scab or manginess. Titillation sometimes insers violence, not by
dividing the tangent spirits through it self and immediately, but by accident
through gathering the spirits too much together through its light appulse, to
which they do accur in great quantity, and often do as it were thereby overstrain
or overreatch themselves.

It seldom happens, that ones proper feeling does tickle any part of his body,
as his knee, or palm of the hand: But if another do gently touch it, it tickles
him: the reason is, because that, which touches a part must be of a certain
distant temperament from the part felt, which is not in a man's own self, but in
every other man; besides ones fancy adds much to it.

I. HItherto I have discoursed of the Elements, their Production, Forms, Second
and Third, Single and Mixed Qualities, with intention to have declared their
Dissolution from the Chaos, and separation from one another, and therefore I
did only mention so much touching their nature, as might suffice to discover
the reason and causes of their effects produced by them through their
dissolution. At that time and place I thought it unseasonable to demonstrate
the causes of their only apparent contrary motions and effects, whereby they
return to one another, and exercise a mutual commerce between each other, and
seem (but really do not) to change into one another Nature, all which
together, with the particular relation of each Element, as they are consisting
at present, of local motion in general, and in particular of Attraction and
Repuision, and of Meteors, I shall endeavor to propose to you by a sensible
Demonstration. Why I judged it unseasonable to treat of these Particulars
above, was because I would not oppress your Fancy with seeming contrary
Notions (but really agreeing to a hair,) and so might have endangered the
Conception, and Retention of the precedent ones, which now I may with more
safety attempt, supposing you to have weighed the Reasons, and to have narrowly
searched into their meaning. Neither shall I repeat any thing of what has been
set down already, but proceed where I left off; only since now I may with
security discover my meaning of these Expressions of moving from the Center to
the Circumference, and to the Center from the Circumference, both which I have
hitherto made use of for to perduce you to a true apprehension of the Chaos and
its dissolution. By moving from the Center to the Circumference was not
intended a deserting of the proper Center of those Elements that were said so
to move, but,

1. To move so from their Center as to tend and be diffused thence to the
Circumference into the greatest tenuity or rarity, but not to desert their
proper Center; for then they could not move at all, because all motions are
peracted upon an immovable, which must be a Center.

2. To move from the circumference to the center, is not to desert the
circumference, and be reduced by penetration into a central point (as
Mathematicians do imagine,) but to be contracted to a Center from a
circumference for to gain the greatest dense weight or weighty crassitude, like
others are diffused for to gain the greatest rarity or tenuity; and that
naturally, for density or crassitude cannot be attained by any other manner
then by a contraction to a Center; and rarity and tenuity but by a diffusion
from a Center.

3. Intending by moving from a Center to a Circumference to signify a tendency
to the greatest contiguous rarity or continuous levity, I do not exclude but
that such light Elements in a confusion with opposite Elements as it happened
in the Chaos, may also tend from a Center of Magnitude, because they are
expelled by the overpowering weighty Elements expelling them from their Center,
and so in this signification I have sometimes intended by moving from the
Center a deserting of the Center of Magnitude, or sometimes of the universal
Center.

4. None but the whole body of the Elements do tend to, or strive for the
universal Center; but particular or mixed bodies for their own particular
Center, as you may read further in the Chapter of Local Motions.

II. The earth is, and must necessarily be the Center of the world, or of all
the other Elements, within which it is contained like the Yolk of an Egg
within the White and the Shell. I prove the Proposition: If the nature of Earth
be to move conically from the Circumference to its own Center through a
contiguous gravity, and the nature of Air and Fire be to be equally diffused
from the center through their levity; ergo the earth must needs fall to the
midst of them all, its parts tending circularly and conically to their Center.
The earth being arrived to the center, it rests quiet and unmovable: the
Reason you shall know by and by. Return back to the explanation of the manner
of the dissolution of the Chaos, which cannot but demonstrate the evidence of
this Point to you.

Nevertheless let us consider that old Fancy of Pythagoras, Plato,
Aristarchus, Seleucus, Niceta, and others upon this Matter, revived by
Copernicus in the preceding Centenary, and weigh its probability.

1. He imagines the fixed Stars and their Region to be the extremity of the
world, and both to be immovable.

2. That the Figure of that Region does appear to us to be circular, but for
what we know, our Sense may be deceived.

3. That the Sun is the Center of the aspectable world, being immovable as to
its ex ernal place; notwithstanding since through help of the Telescopium is
observed by the discerning of the motion of its Spots to change his face about
(although still remaining in the same external place) its own Axis in 27 days.

4. Between these two immoveables the Planets are said to move, and among them,
viz. between Mars and Venus, the Earth is imagined as a Planet to move about
the Sun, and to absolve her Circuit in twelve Months.

5. That the Moon is seated between the Earth and Venus, and is thought to move
through its own particular motion about the earth between that space, which
there is granted to be between her and Venus, and between her and Mars: Besides
the Moon does also move with the Earth, as if she were her Page, about the Sun,
absolving her course much about the same time. In like manner are the four
Stars first discovered through a Telescopium Or a perspective-Glass first
invented some 40 or 50 years ago by Jacobus Metius of Alcmaer, although
accidentally by holding one piece of glass before another to his eye, whereof
the nearest was somewhat thicker the^ the other.
by Galilaeus, said to follow the motion of Jupiter, and to move with it about
the Sun in twelve years, there being besides another motion adscribed to them,
whereby they move about the Same Jupiter between the space which is between it
and Saturn, and between it and Mars; the innermost whereof absolves its course
about it in a day and a quarter; the next in three days and a half; the third
in three days and four hours; the last in sixteen days and eight hours:
besides these, they have found out by the help of the said Telescopium Stars,
which are Concomitants to each Planet.

6. That the space between Saturn and the fixed stars is almost immense.

That the Region of the fixed stars is immovable, he takes for granted without
giving any probable proof for it; for which notwithstanding may be urged (Omne
mobile fit super immobili) that all movables do move upon an immovable; which
if granted, does not infer that therefore the Region of the fixed stars
must be immovable, since he has stated one immovable already, namely, the
Sun; what need is there then of more? Further, if we do grant two universal
immoveables, we must also grant two universal contrary motions; whereof the one
is moved upon one immovable, the other upon the second; but the universal
diurnal motion of the stars we see is one and the same; ergo but one universal
immovable is necessary. Lastly, He cannot prove it by any sense, only that it
must be so, because it agrees with his supposition, and what proof is that to
another? The holy words in Eccles. do further disprove his position; where it
is said that God moved the Heavens about within the compass of his Glory. His
second Position denotes him no great Naturalist.

The third Position infers the Sun to be the immovable Center of the world.

1. This does manifestly contradict Scripture, which does often make mention of
the Suns rising and going down: And in Isaiah 38. 8. the Sun is said to have
returned ten degrees back. And in another place, Let not the Sun move against
Galbaon.

2. The Sun is accounted by most, and proved by us to be a fiery body, or a
flame, and therefore is incapable of attaining to rest in a restless Region,
which if it did, its flame would soon diminish through the continual rushing by
of the fiery Element tearing its flames into a thousand parts, whose effects
would certainly prove destructive to the whole Universe, but especially to all
living Creatures.

3. Were the Sun immovable, and enjoying its rest; ergo that rest must either
be a violent detention, or a natural rest; not the first, because that could
not be durable; or what can there be thought potent enough to detain that vast
and most powerful body of the Sun? for that must also be sensibly demonstrated
and cleared, otherwise you do nothing. Neither can it be the latter; for were
it natural, it must not only have a natural principle of rest, but also be
contained in a vacuum, or else in a Region whose parts have likewise attained
to a natural rest through the enjoying of their Center. It is a property of a
Center to be as a point in comparison to the Circumference; but nothing can be
contracted to a point but Earth and water, as I have showed above; whereas
according to their own confession the Sun is a vast great body, and its Beams
spreading and dilating; ergo it must be only Earth and Water. Now what sign of
predominance of Earth and Water is there apparent in the Sun? for were it so,
the Sun would show black, and give no light.

The Moon is liker (if any) to be the Center, it consisting by far of more
earth then the Sun, as her minority in body, motion and degree of brightness do
testify,

Lastly, Is it not more probable that our sight should hallucinate, or be
deceived in judging the Sun not to move, then in judging it to move, all
Astronomical Phaenomena's being so consentaneous to this latter Judgment?
Besides, how is it possible for us to judge, whether the Sun does move or rest,
since that according to this supposition we are carried about with that
swiftness? By the same reason we may doubt of the motion of all the other
Planets.

The fourth Position concludes a most rapid motion of the earth. What principle
of motion can the earth consist of? Of none certainly, but of fire and air,
which are admitted into her body in so improportionable a measure, that they
cannot be thought to impel the earth to the least local motion. Moreover earth
is of so heavy a body, that it is rendered altogether incapable of circular
local motion: otherwise were the Mass of earth so prone to such a swift
circular motion, certainly its parts, as terrestrial mixed bodies would retain
the same inclination to the same motion, which we find to be contrary According
to the Perip. and this supposition all light bodies (ordinarily so called) must
be said to be heavy, and all heavy bodies light; for bodies by them are counted
heavy, which move downward, that is, toward the center; ergo fire must be said
to be heavy, and earth light, because the one moves upwards to its supposed
universal center, and the other from it: But this is absurd, Can a point move
through so vast or almost immense a Region, and with that velocity? In all
other Natural things we find that a Point of any Element has no force or
proportion to move through a span of another Element, although that point be
supposed to be detained violently. Take a particle of Earth, which is no point,
and let it fall out of your hand, it will hardly move down to the earth, or if
it does, it is so slow, that is hardly perceptible; but much less would a point
move. If then the earth be but as a point to so immense a Region, it cannot be
supposed to move. Possible you do reply, that it is impelled by an extrinsick
movent: Suppose I granted it, its motion being violent, could not be durable;
besides the proportion of a point is insinitely too little for to receive such
a most swift impulse, which through its littleness it would doubtless effuge.
Were the Earth a Planet or Star, it is supposed it should cast a light, which
is repugnant to its Nature, through which, as I have showed before, she is
rendered dark, and is the cause of all darkness. Were this absurdity admitted,
all our knowledge, which hitherto wise men have so labored to accomplish would
be in vain; for as I said before, earth and earthy bodies must be light, fire
and fiery bodies must be heavy, and enjoy their rest: water and waterish bodies
must be likewise heavy, the air and ayry bodies must be weighty, and enjoy
their rest; for if the earth moves, it is certainly moved through the air, the
which according to that supposition must be immovable, because all movables
(omne mobile sit super immobili) are moved upon an immovable Subject: All dark
colors must be supposed light; all Astronomical appearances, shadows, sounds,
tastes, Sents and all mixed bodies must then be understood to be contrary to what
really they are. Scripture is likewise plain against it, Job 26. 7. Psalm. 24.
2. For he has founded it (namely the earth) upon the Seas, and est ablisht it
upon the floods. Job 38. 6. Whereupon are the foundations there of (to wit of
the Earth) fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof? Psalm. 104. 5. Who
laid the foundations of the Earth that it should not be moved for ever. What
need there more words to consute so absurd an Opinion?

But to return to my Proposition; That the Earth must necessarily be the Center
of the world. I proved it above, where I did defer the reason of its rest to
this place.

The earth of all the elements does alone enjoy her rest; because she alone
does possess a Center, whereby she enjoyes her own natural internal motion; but
suppose another element to possess the place of her center, and the Earth to
cover it immediately, then doubtless the Earth would continue in external
motion (because its parts are violently detained from a center) and press upon
that body (which does oppose it by keeping her out of her place) until she had
removed it, which being removed, it could not be thought to be longer in
external local motion, since she had recovered her natural place, unless we
should absurdly imagine, that one part should move against the other for to
gain a penetration of bodies. If then N. Copern. D. Origan. and others, who
strive to maintain the threefold motion of the earth (viz. of inclination and
declination, its daily and yearly motion) had discovered, that the earth were
violently detained by some other Element or body, then they might have thence
demonstrated a motion; but then this motion could have been no other, than the
motion of water is about the earth, whereby the earth would have moved about
its detaining body, which if it had it would have been immovable nevertheless
as to its external place, only it would have turned about, and have made
several appearances of faces, or spots: in brief it would have had the same
motion, which Copernicus adscribed to the Sun. Hence it is more than apparent
that the earth is the Center of the world and does enjoy her rest. The reason
of its rest is so demonstrative that no rational body can deny it. I proceed.

III. The earth may commodiously be divided into three regions, differing from
one another in purity of body, weight, density, etc. The first Region I call
the central region, because it extends nearest about the Cencer. Its Periphery
is about 120. degrees, its Diameter is 38 ^/^. This Region consists of most
pure earth, and most freed from the peregrin Elements; wherefore its weight and
density, is the weightiest and most dense. It contains no mixed bodies within it
self, because it is so remote that the peregrin Elements cannot move thither;
besides, that smallest proportion of peregrin Elements, which may happily be
supposed to be detained in the central region is so much depressed and firmly
detained by the weight of the earth, that it is impossible it should come to
any head to constitute a mixed body. Its color must be conceived to be a pure
fundamental black.

The second, or the middle region contains in its circumference 240 degrees;
its Latitude To wit, from the extreme circumference of the second region, to
the circumference of the first.
is 191/9 degr. This region is less weighty and dense than the central, as
being accompanied with a greater proportion of extraneous Elements. It harbors
some mixed bodies, as imperfect stones, but no Metals. The reason of this
assertion is drawn from the proportion of the Elements, which there are not
enough in quantity to constitute the body of metals or perfect stones; besides,
we cannot imagine that the earth should contain any hollownesses in the second
region Because of its depressing weight.
, which are requisite (as I shall show by and by) for the generation of perfect
stones and metals.

IV. The third region of the earth comprehends in its circuit 360 degrees, in
its Latitude (not its complete diameter) 191/9. This last or extreme region
consists of most (that is, more than the two former regions) extraneous
Elements, because it is situated nearer to the proper regions of the said
extraneous Elements, which do violently strive to enter her body (as you shall
read anon) whereby and through which the earth, especially near to her surface
is rendered of a very unequal temperature, where the extraneous Elements uniting
together do raise a hollowness in the earth, and infinuate into one another
substance or body, to which the coldness of the earth is very much conducing,
thereby gathering or coagmenting the said Elements together, and impelling them
into one another body, and then closing them firmly; all which it performs
through its coldness. Through coldness understand its compressing weighty
minima's. Wherefore, do not still abide in your obstinate conceit that it is
the Sun, which is the efficient cause of Minerals and Stones: For that is
absurd. I prove it. That, which is the main efficient of Stones and Metals must
be a contracting, condensing, and indurating substance; but the Sun is no
contracting, condensing, or indurating substance; Ergo the Sun cannot be the
efficient of Stones and Metals. The Major is undeniable. I confirm the Minor by
proving the contrary, namely, that the Sun does mollify, because its flame is
soft, and all heat is soft; for softning is nothing else but to dispose a body
to bend easily into its self if pressed from without: But earth rarefied by
fire does easily bend into it self, if pressed from without. Ergo, The Minor is
evident, because whatever is thoroughly hot and fiery is soft, as we see in
red-hot Iron, in alive flesh, and all Vegetables. So that, by how much the more
heat a body has, by so much the softer it is, provided quod caetera sint
paria. Further, What heat is there under the Earth? I confess there is more and
less coldness under it, but no predominating heat. What heat can there be in
Greenland, especially under the earth, and yet it is certain that many rocks
and stones are generated there? They may as well say, that fire is the
efficient cause of all those Islands of Ice. Again, so much as a substance
consists of coldness and earth, by so much it participates of hardness; or by
how much the less heat a body consists of, so much the less hardness it
partakes of. The matter of a stone in the kidneys or in the bladder was sofe
when it fluctuated within the vessals, but being detained in the kidneys its
heat is diminished either through the intense heat of the Kidneys, which does
dissipate and attract the lesser heat from the matter retained in the cavity of
the kidneys, through which ecess of heat the terrestrial and thick waterish
parts are coagulated and are closed together through the depressing coldness of
the intrinsic earth and water. The same matter being retained in kidneys of a
cold temperament, does immediately through that degree of coldness coagulate
and grow hard. The stone in the bladder is generally harder than the stone in
the kidneys; because the one is of a far colder (that is less hot) temperament
than the other. That in the kidneys is more friable, whereas the stone in the
bladder is affected with a continuous firm thick waterish hardness. This I can
witness by a stone being taken from a Patient by section, which that most
learned and expert Physician Dr. George Bate showed me six or seven years ago:
This stone was perduced to that hardness, that I am confident an ordinary smart
stroke of a hammer could scarce break it: Yet when it was within the bladder it
was far distant from such a hardness; for a piece of the Catheter was unawares
run into the body of the stone and broke in it, which was afterward taken out
with it; but after it had been exposed a little while to the air, it grew
immediately to that hardness: What could be the cause of this but the hotter
parts of the stone exhaling into the air, whereby the cold parts fell closer
and thereby arrived to a greater hardness? The error of Fernelius is obvious
in that he stated the intense heat of the kidneys to be the cause of a
Lithiasis; for it happens as freqently in kidneys of a cold temperament:
neither is it an (insita renum arenosa calculosaque dispositio a parentibus
contracta) hereditary, fixed, fabulous, and calculous disposition (as the same
Author conceives,) which does consist in a degree of temperament of the solid
parts of the kidneys; for stones have been generated in kidneys of all kinds of
temperaments: neither can it be said to be hereditary, for many a man has been
troubled with the stone, whose Issue never was so much as disposed to it; and
on the other side, many a man has been miserably tormented with the stone or
Duelech as Paracelsus terms it, whose Parents never discerned the least symptom
of a stone within their bodies; Nevertheless, as I said before, the temperature
of the kidneys adds much to the accelerating of a Lithiasis. It is then certain
that the greatest cause of lapidation or (...) is internal, depending upon the
predominance of earth or coldness over the other Elements in a mixture. The
Focus (or Uterus as Van Helmont terms it, that is the place where a stone or
gravel is generated) must be a close hollow place; wherefore nothing can arrive
to this close hollow place, unless it be liquid; for a thick or course body
will be intercepted before it can reach thither. This liquid matter being now
lodged within this cavity, the hot parts do exhale, because now through the
hollowness of the place they have got liberty to dislate, and free themselves
from the heavy terrestrial and thick aqueous parts, whereas before when they
were kept close together through channels and lodges shutting close upon them
the hot parts were firmly contained within and bound up. This is necessarily
and certainly demonstrative, and infers, that where ever close hollownesses are
groved, and that liquid matter containing terrestrial and aqueous parts in it
may reach to them, there certainly stones and metals can and may be generated.
By virtue of this position I shall prove and show by and by, that stones and
metals may be generated in most hollow parts of the body of man. But to pursue
my discourse: The hot parts being now freed from the terrestrial parts, and
inhering in subtle ayry serosiries do with more ease and force procure their
passage through this close and hollow prison than they made their way thither,
leaving the terrestrial and aqueous parts behind them for a Ransom, which by
degrees are coagulated more and more according to the expulsion of the fiery
and ayry parts. Understand also the reasons of the qualification of the Focus
or womb of stones and Metals.

1. It must be hollow, the reason of this is set down already.

2. It must be close; for were it not close but open the terrestrial and
aqueous matter could not be detained there, but would have as free a passage as
the thin parts. Besides, closeness conduces to keep out extrinsick heat, which
otherwise would again dissolve and mollify the work; wherefore the hardest
stones and metals are found some degrees below the Surface of the earth, and I
dare confidently assert, that if metals were dug for deeper under the ground
their labor would be richly answered by finding purer and better metals.

3. The coldness of these places must be a proportionable coldness; for if the
places be too cold, then the liquid parts will be detained from arriving to
cast up hollownesses by being too much incrassated and condensed, whereby the
energy of their rare and subtle parts is suppressed.

4. The liquid matter must also have a due proportion of the Elements whereby
to constitute certain kinds of stones and metals. If the matter be thick and
terrestrial not containing many subtle and rare parts, then it will generate
into a course stone. The reason of the courseness is, because the terrestrial
and aqueous Elements are but rudely mixed, by reason they wanted internal heat,
whereby their parts might be divided into lesser particles, and so become the
more concocted and harder. In case the matter be more subtle and rare, and that
the course parts are united in less particles, then the said stone will
according to its degree of fineness and concoction prove flinty, Marble,
Jaspis, Cornelian, etc. In case there be more thick water than earth, the body
thence generated becomes crystalline; as Crystal, Diamonds, Rubies, etc. In
these water does retain almost its natural consistence, as I shall tell you
immediately. In case there be an equal part of earth and water, and these well
concocted and entirely mixed together, it produces Gold. If there be something
more of water than earth, and they well percocted and permisted, they engender
Silver. If there be an equal proportion of water and earth, and they only
rudely concocted and but half mixed, it generates Copper. If there be more earth
than water, and but half mixed and concocted, it constitutes Iron. If there be
more water than earth, and they but rudely mixed and rawly cocted, the effect
will prove Lead, or according to the proportion of the ingredients and coction
Pewter. Mercury is generated out of water being rendered fluid through much air
and fire, containing withal a small part of earth. These do not only differ in
proportion of materials, but also in degree of internal heat and of the
temperament of their Matrix, otherwise termed a vein from its Cylindrical
Figure. Gold had the strongest heat, whereby the parts were firmly united in
minima's, which heat did after the performance of its office exhale by degrees;
nevertheless suppose that there was a degree of heat left: the matrix of Gold
must be very close for to retain that intense heat so long until the
constituting parts are well permisted and concocted. As for the external
temperament of the climate, it is little material to the business, since we see
that Gold, Silver, etc. are generated in cold countries as well as in hot, in
moist as well as in dry. It is the internal temperament of the earth, which
supplies fit matter for the generation of metals. The Matrix of Silver is less
close, the matrix of Brass more open than it, and so gradually in the others.

Mines or mineral veins are usually found to be in hills or mountains, because
these do generally contain hollownesses, especially if they appear dry and
sandy without. Those mountains are for the most part best disposed for the
generation of metals, that are situated at a convenient nearness to a pure
crystalline river. Easterly mountains are most to be suspected, provided the
River which is not far distant from them be easterly withal. The clearness of
sky is no small token. A long Bar of Iron thrust into the ground after having
dug to some depth, if it changes whitish or yellowish, gives no small
suspicion of Gold or Silver. A long trunk peirced likewise into the ground
where suspected as deep as may be, and afterward applying the ear to it, if it
renders a tinging or sibulous boiling noise, is a sign of some hidden treasure
under that soil.

That the generation of Metals is such as I have proposed may be
demonstratively proved by sense from their color, consistency, difficulty of
liquation, from the theorems of concoction, the which since you may easily
collect from what has been hitherto discoursed upon, I shall omit any further
proof.

V. The present occasion does urge me to touch somewhat upon the transmution of
Metals. The difference, which there is between them you may collect from their
matter, degree of coction and disposition of matrix: However there is more
agreement between themselves, than there is between them and stones; wherefore
the question is, Whether Silver is transmutable into Gold. Here I propose the
doubt according to its most probable appearance, there being less difference
between Gold and Silver than between Gold and any of the others. I answer, That
naturally it cannot be, because it is impossible that after Silver has once
acquired its form, it should be convertible into a perfecter form: Because heat
is deficient, for it is exhaled; neither was there ever at its highest internal
heat enough to have concocted it into the nature of Gold; or had there been
heat enough there would have been too much water and air: The case is less
probable after its constitution, specification, and individuation that it
should change into another species, or another individuum. If the transmutation
to a greater perfection of all other species and individua be impossible, so
must this also: But the Antecedence is true, ergo the consequence likewise. I
grant that it is possible to reduce it to a more imperfect and base species,
that being plain in all corruptions. Wherefore I say that it seems more
possible to reduce Gold into Silver, Silver into Brass or Pewter, Brass into
Iron, and Iron into Mercury, by means of an artificial corruption, because the
finer Metal may be thought to contain the courser as an inferior degree,
whence it is ascended; but the finer cannot contain that in it self, which is
finer than it self is. Neither can our proposed transmutation be effected by
any art of man, unless he knew a means, whereby to detract such a proportion of
the redundant waterish parts of the Silver, as that there might remain just as
much as is required to constitute Gold; besides the work will need a strong and
vehement internal concoction, and that to a certain degree, and for a certain
duration. It will require also a justly disposed matrix, all which I conceive
impossible to art. They may as well strive to make a Ruby or a Diamond out of a
Flint. Happily you will object, That some have converted Silver and Brass into
Gold through the admission of some volatile subtle penetrative particles, which
were of that force, as might be supposed to have divided the whole mass of
Silver and penetrated into and through all its minima's, whereby the gross
parts fell closer to one another and become perfectly concocted, so as through
their consistency to represent the true weight and color of Gold, which might
really pass our censure upon a Touchstone. I answer, That it is possible to
change a courser metal so, that it shall be like to Gold both in weight and
superficial color; but then this color will not be equable throughout all its
parts, neither are the parts so digested, concocted, and closely united as they
should be. In fine, this artificial Gold is no more real Gold, than an
artificial Pearl is like to a true Oriental one, or a glass Diamond to a true
one. At the best it is but counterfeit Gold, which immediately shall be
dissolved by Aq. Fort. whereas the other will not suffer it self to be touched
by it, unless it be fortified by a rectification upon salt Armoniack.

Chemical furnace hunters do strangely boast of their secrets of preparing
aurum Potabile, or tincture of Gold. Others do through ignorance of the art and
want of skill assert the said preparation to be impossible. Questionless were
the thing of a harder nature, these laborious Vulcans would work it out;
nevertheless their arrogance and immodesty in proclaiming of the transcendent
and admirable effects of it does forfeit their modesty and wrong that noble
Art. Aurum potabile (say they) is an universal medicine curing all diseases,
restoring youth, and retarding old age, prolonging life to an eval duration; in
fine Aurum potabile is good for all things; or rather Aurum portabile is. Here
you have a great many rash and vain words, the contrary whereof I have so often
seen come to pass. I have known it to cause a dysentery through its corrosive
spirits, which it retains either from its last menstrunm, or from its first
Dissolvent, viz. Aqua Regia. It provokes Sweat and Urin, but withal is very
offensive to the Liver and heart, because of the said adventitious spirits.
That, which they call the tincture or quinta essentia of Gold is nothing but
the outward rust of Gold, which the aquaregia begot upon it through its
corruptive quality.

In summa, the natural fixed spirits of Gold are inseparable, or at least those
that are separable are corrupted by the poisonous spirits of the dissolvent.
Suppose they were separable from its body without being stained, the most we
can conceive of them is, that they are a subtle diaphoretick; and then hardly
comparable to others, whose nature is more consentaneous to ours, as spir. C.
C. tinct. Croci. Lilium Antim. Paracelsi, etc.

Besides these forementioned hard bodies the earth does also engender others
less hard, and some soft ones, consisting of a more ayry and fiery nature.
These are in like manner conceived in Matrices or wombs, differing from the
others in length, exility and shape. Of these there is a double sort
observable, the one being more fiery and waterish, the other more ayry and
fiery. The first is saline, the other unctious. Stones and Metals being more
earthy and consentaneous to the nature of earth are retained and cherished
within the earth; but the others being much distant from its nature are
expelled nearer to its Surface. I shall first begin with the salin bodies.

VI. There is a certain fermentation within the earth, which is nothing else
but the contraction of the earth by the compression of its parts upon one
another, whereby the extraneous Elements are expelled; but since these cannot
be abstracted from the body of the earth without the firm and close adherence
of some earthy minima's, they do draw them along; the proportion of which
earthy minima's, and their degree of closeness of union do constitute the
differences of all earthy mixed bodies. The Salin juyces are attenuated
waterish bodies permixt with condensed fire, and a small proportion of earthy
minima's, which do concrease by the evaporation of the greater part of air,
leaving behind it water thickened naturally through its absence. Fire is closer
united to these salin juyces, than it is to the unctious ones, to which air is
more close united than to these. Many of these salin juyces are transparent
through the predominance of water, others are of other colors according to the
proportion of earth. We see that among these many concrease in an angular form,
as appears in Allume, Vitriol, etc. which happens through the degrees of the
airs evaporation; for the air evaporating unequally causes such an angular
induration. The air does evaporate unequally, in that it does sooner desert the
extreme parts, as being less thick and dense, and more remote from the
centrical ones, which do retain the air the longest. The first evaporation
leaves an acuteness for an angle, the second subtilities, is being more slow,
evaporate by degrees, so causing a greater obtusion from the foresaid
acuteness. The evaporation it self is caused by the weighty Elements expelling
the light parts through their weight.

The earthy salin juyces are principally these, Common salt, Salt gemmae,
Saltpeter, Allume, Salt armoniack, and Vitriol.

Common salt is nothing but the relict or residence of sea water, or of saltish
fountain water being evaporated. This kind of salt contains more loose air, but
less fire than others.

Salt gemmae is a fossil salt dug out of the earth, and is somewhat more
fiery and consistent of closer air than the former.

Saltpeter is threefold. 1. Is drawn by coction from nitrous earth.

2. Sweats through stone walls and concreaseth upon their Surface, like unto a
white frost or mould.

3. Is gathered from the rocks: This salt consists of more dense parts of
fire pent in by close air, which again is enclosed by subtle minima's of earth.

Allume comprehends five sorts. 1. Roch allom, which is drawn from Rocky
stones. 2. Which is dug out of Mines. 3. Which remains after the evaporation
of mineral waters. This salt is of a courser nature, consisting of more water
and earth than the others.

Salt armoniack is a salin juice sweating out a certain earth of Libya, and
concreased under the sands. That which we use instead of it is an artificial
salt, by far of a lesser efficacy, made out of five parts of man's urine, one
part of common salt, and half a part of wood soot, being boiled together and
evaporated to a consistence. This sort of salt is stronger than any of the
others, consisting of a dense fire closely knit with air and incorporated with
a watered earth.

Vitriol is known in several sorts, 1. There is Hungary or Cyprian Vitriol of a
sky color like unto a Saphir, compact like Ice, and dry. 2. Is of a greenish
color concreased in grains or crumbs like unto common salt, but withal or
somewhat unctious. 3. White Vitriol, like unto loaf-sugar. Vitriol may justly
be censured half a metal, it consisting of the same course parts, of which Iron
and Copper do consist of. It contains much earth mixed with a dense fire.

VII. The unctious and bituminous bodies generated and cast forth by the earth
are Sulphur, Arsenick, Amber, Naptha, Peteroil, Asphaltos, Oil of earth,
Sea-coal, and Gagates or Jeat stone.

Sulphur is an unctious juice of the earth concreased within a particular
matrix, and consisting of dense fire inhering in a loose incrassated air.

Arsenick comprehends three sorts. 1. Is yellow, and is otherwise named
Auripigmentum. 2. Being red is called Sandaracha. 3. Is singularly named
Arsenick, or crystalline Arsenick, being of a whitish color. Their body is
constituted out of a most dense fire united to a thick air; from this extreme
density of fire it happens to be of that corrosive and venomous nature, that it
proves an immediate poison to man, because through its intense dense heat, it
extracts, expels, and suffocates his natural heat, in which respect it is but
little less corruptive and hot than focal fire. Of these three sorts Arsenick
is counted the least caustic and malignant, the next Auripigmentum.

Amber is known by three sorts. 1. There is that, which is particularly called
Amber. 2. Is called Succinum. 3. Is whitish Amber, otherwise called Sperma
Ceti. Whether there is any black Amber is doubted: Some do affirm it as having
seen it. A mistake certainly, either they took Jeat, or some other substance
made out of Musk, Lign. Aloes, Styrax and Ladanum for it. Grayish Amber
(otherwise called Ambergreece) is thought to be the purest, smoothest, and of
the best Sent. Succinum is of two sorts, viz. white and yellow. Spermaceti is
by many deemed to be found supernatant atop the Sea, who assert it to be rather
the Seed of a Whale; if so, then it must have been generated in their Stomachs
or Throats, some having found some quantity sticking in their Throats: but this
does more probably argue, that it was supernatant atop the Sea, and devoured by
the Whale. But for what I know, this may be a Story, nevertheless it is certain
it has been gathered in the Indian and Ethiopian Seas near to the Shore,
where Whales have scarcely ever appeared. Neither can I imagine this to be
that, which ancient Physicians called the Flower of Salt, there being too great
a difference between their Descriptions. Flower of Salt is described to be
reddish and liquid, and to be of a detergent Nature and saltish taste, whereas
the other is a white furfuraceous famess, being of an emollient Nature, and of
a fat taste, and in all particulars directly contrary.

Ambergreece happens to be supernatant upon the Sea, and some Fountains too,
from being communicated by the earth in bituminous and lixivious exbalations,
and exalted and purified by the motion and subliming faculty of the Sea,
coagulated atop through the exhaling of the hotter spirits and concreased by
the ambient coldness.

The Succinum or common Amber wanting that exaltation and sublimation, is found
in Germany and Italy in Mines to be of an inferior nature. It is also gathered
from the Sea. The Spirits of Amber are rare and subtle, consisting of a thick
ayry body.

Naphtha and Peteroyl differ from Amber in consistency and greater quantity of
fire and air, these being liquid and more inflammable, but in all other
particulars agreeing, Peteroyl and Naptha having often been found to lodge in
liquid substances within the body of common Amber. Naptha is gathered in great
quantity about Babylon, the earth there being so tempered with the peregrine
Elements, that it protrudes abundance of this kind of Bitumon. Peteroyl is most
frequently collected flowing out of Rocks.

Asphaltus is a hard black and splendent Bitumen, like unto shining Pitch,
heavy, and of a strong Sent. It is gathered swimming atop of Lakes; in other
places it is taken out of the Earth near to its Surface. The Mare mortuum in
Judaea affords the best and greatest quantity. This is different from the
others through its containing a greater proportion of Earth, and greater
density of Fire.

As Peteroyl flows out of the Rocks, so does Oil of Earth out of the Earth and
Hills in some parts of East India. It is of a transparent Red, and a strong Sent
like unto Peteroyl, but more pleasing.

The virtues of all these Bitumens, excepting Arsenick, are praised for their
emollient, discutient, comforting the Brain, the Nerves and Membranes, thence
healing wounds by comforting the calidum innatum of the said parts when
wounded, and for their anodine nature, thence giving ease to the Joints in
Arthritical pains: all which they perform through a Subtle and Balsamic Spirit.

Sea-coal is called by the Latinists Carbo Petrae, and Terra Ampelitis;
notwithstanding the latter name denotes a thing somewhat distinct from the
former, in that it is more bituminous and less hard. The other is nothing but
Earth and Sulphur concocted and conglutinated into a stonish substance, and is
no where engendered, but where the Earth is hollow, and foecundated with store
of a sulphurous Bitumen.

Gagates, or Jeat, is a Bitumen of a more concocted body, and more sulphurous.
The Proverb speaks it to be very black. It is kindled and burns as soon as
Brimstone if touched by fire, and gives a Bituminous Scent. Its virtue is the
same with other Bitumens.

VIII. Besides these, there are some other mean bodies generated within the
Earth, which are neither Metals, or Saline, or unctious Juyces; they are not so
hard, nor so much concocted as Metals, neither are they so loose and rare as
Saline and Unctious Bodies. They are particularly these: Mercury, Antimony,
Marcasita, Cobaltum, Chalcitis, Misy and Sorry. The first we have treated of
above.

The next is Marcasita, otherwise Bismuthum, which is a heavy, hard, brittle,
whitish body, shining within with little points of Gold and Silver. Its Matter
is too course to generate Gold or Silver, but is as it were the Dross of them
both, and is separated from them as a Natural Excrement, which is concocted
into a Body of a courser Substance. Its Spirits are more dense, and Earth is
more in proportion; Water less. This has endued the Nature of Venom, because
of its dense heat. You are not to conceive that this is only an Excrement of
Gold and Silver, but that it is also a perfect body primarily generated out of
the same proportion of the Elements within a proper Matrix, and therefore is to
be found in Mines, where there is no sign of Gold or Silver. It is repercutient
from its earth, dissolving and detergent from its dense fire, if applied
externally. Its water is a very potent dissolvent of Gold and Silver.

Cobaltum, otherwise called Natural Cadmia, is the courser Body or Excrement of
Copper. It is weighty, and of a black color. Its fire is extremely dense, in
such a manner, that it is thence rendered to be the strongest Poison. Its
caustic and corroding quality penetrates so violently through the Gloves and
Shoes of the Diggers, that it ulcerates their hands and feet.

Chalcitis, Misy and Sorry differ from one another in courseness of Substance,
and are often found to grow one atop the other.

Chalcitis is like Copper, and brittle; in consistency of courseness it is
between Sorry, which is thinner, and Misy, which is somewhat thicker then it.

Misy is of a Brass color, glistering through its body with Sparks like Gold,
growing about Chalcitis like an outermost Crust, or like Rust about Iron.

Sorry is a Mineral, hard and thick like to a Stone, glistering with yellowish
Sparks. These three are of a causting quality, thereby burning Scars and Crusts
into the Flesh; besides they are somewhat adstringent. Misy is the strongest,
and Sorry is the next to it in strength.

Antimony is a Mineral of a bluish color, shining throughout its Body like
Streeks of Silver, its mixture is out of course earth and dense fire, yet less
dense then any of the foregoing. Its virtue is internally vomitive and
purgative, externally it is discutient, detergent and adstringent. All these
are natural recrements of Metals, yet not recrements alone, as I said before.

Bombast and his Sectators analyze all Metals and Minerals into Sal, Sulphur,
and Mercury; as if they were all generated out of these, as their first
Principles; for say they, our Art instructs us to reduce every Metal or Mineral
into each of those foresaid Principles.

Either this is to be understood, that it is possible to reduce all Minerals
really into Sal, Sulphur and Mercury, or into some certain more concected
beings analogal to them. Generally they seem to pretend to educe real Mercury
out of all Minerals; but as for the others they are only analogal. Why should
they more expect to extract real Mercury then real Salt or Sulphur? Wherefore
it will be more consisting with Reason to conclude them all equally analogal,
that is like in consistency to ordinary Mercury, Sal and Sulphur, but not in
effects. It is a Madness for any one to imagine, that Gold is constituted by
the same Mercury, but more concocted, that is usually dug out of Mines; and
that Mercury is convertible into Gold, if thereunto intended by a strong
concocting preparation. They might as well say, that Gut-Excrements were
convertible into Flesh, and that flesh consisted out of the said real
Excrements.

The Case is thus: Mercury is by them accounted to be an Excrement of Metals,
wherefore as an Excrement is a Body really different from those bodies, from
which it is rejected, and in no wise convertible, unless it be some of the
purest parts of it, that have escaped natures Diligence; so neither is Mercury
any part of Metals, nor convertible into them, unless it be the smallest purest
parts, which had fled the earths Metalliferous quality.

Possibly you will Object that Gold feeds upon Mercury, and Mercury upon it,
wherefore they are convertible into one another Nature.

I deny the Antecedence: for Gold is dissolved and destroyed by it; as appears
in Amalgamation, or dissolving Gold by the fume of Mercury, ergo it is not fed
by it.

Mercury effects no less in the Body of man; for it dissolves his humid parts,
yea his solid parts too, as Mercurial Salivations testify. All which is a
sufficient Argument to induce us to forbear from explaining the Causes of
Natural Beings by Sal, Sulphur and Mercury.

Probably you reply, That this is not the meaning of Bombast, who intended
these Names only to be analogal to those things vulgarly so called. Wherefore
by Mercury is understood a thin pure liquor, by Sulphur, a subtle Spirit, by
Salt, the gross substance of a Body.

I Answer, Either you must take these for first Principles, or for mixed bodies;
they cannot be the first, because his Mercury is constituted out of water
reduced from its greatest hardness into a subtle fluor through admixture of Air
and Fire: His Sulphur consists of fire condensed by Earth, and of Air; ergo
they must be mixed Bodies; if so, they are no first Principles of Metals,
because even these are reducible into more simple bodies, viz. his Mercury into
thick water, a thin air, and a rare fire; Sulphur into air, fire, etc. This I
will grant them, that all Metals are dissolveable into such kinds of analogal
Substances, which are not bodies less mixed, but only changed into bodies of
several consistencies, viz. thick and thin, course and fine.

CHAP. II. Of Stones and Earths.
1. A Description of the most Precious Stones. 2. A Description of the less
Precious Stones that are engendered within Living Creatures. 3. A Description of
the less Precious Stones that are engendered without the Bodies of Living
Creatures: 4. An Enumeration of common stones. 5. A Disquisition upon the
virtues of the forementioned stones. An Observation on the Effects of Powders

admirable in a bloody Flux. 6. A particular Examination of the virtues of a
Bezoar stone, Piedra de Puerco, Pearls, etc. 7. The Kinds of Earth, and their
Virtues.


I. OUr Method has led us to propose the Demonstration of universal Natures
before that of particulars, and that of Metals before the other of imperfect
Minerals and Stones, as being more excellent through their perfection of
mixture; wherefore we have next allotted this Chapter for the treatise of the
particular natures of Stones.

Stones are either known under the name of most Precious, less Precious, or
Common.

The most Precious Stones are ordinarily called Jewels, being 18 in number. 1.
An Agathe. 2. An Amethist. 3. An Asterites. 4. A Beril. 5. A Carbuncle. 6. A
Chalcedonie. 7. A Chrysolite. 8. A Diamond. 9. An Emerald. 10. A Jaspis. 11. An
Jacinth. 12. An Onyx. 13. A Ruby. 14. A Sarda. 15. A Saphir. 16 A Sardonix. 17.
A Topaze. 18. A Turcois.

An Agathe is a stone of diverse mixed colors, and in no wise transparent.

An Asterites is a stone somewhat resembling Crystal, and within the Moon when
she is at full.

An Amethist is a stone of a Violet color.

A Beril is of a Seagreen color, and sometimes is found to have other colors
mixed with it. A Prase is not unlike to it, only that it is not of so deep a
green, neither so hard; for it wears away by much usage.

A Carbuncle is esteemed for the most precious of all Stones, and is of a Gold
or Flaming color. It is said that there is a kind of a Carbuncle (called a
Pyrope) to be found in the East Indies, which shines as bright in the Night as
the Sun does in the Day.

A Chalcedonie is a stone of a Purple color.

A Chrysolite is of a Golden color, hard and transparent.

A Chrysoprase is hard, and of a greenish color.

A Diamond is thought to be the hardest of all Stones.

An Emerald is hard, and of a perfect green color.

A Jaspis is of a greenish color, sported here and there with bloody Spots.

An Jacinth is of a Gold or flaming color. Some of them decline from a Yellow
to a deep Saffron red, or sometimes to a bluish color. They are neither
perspicuous or opake, but between both.

An Onyx is of a brownish white, but of a dull transparency.

An Opale stone is by Pliny, Lib. 37. c. 6, accounted for the best and rarest
of Stones, as participating of the rarest Colors of the rarest Stones: its
fire is more subtle then of a Carbuncle, shining with a Purple of an Amethist,
greenish like to the Seagreen of an Emerald, etc.

A Ruby is a reddish stone. A Granate is a worser sort of Rubies.

A Sarda is of a transparent fiery red color: A Cornelian is comprehended
under it.

A Sardonix is composed (as it were) out of a Sarda and Onyx; it is scarce
transparent.

A Sapphire is opake, but of a clear sky or blew color, and very hard.

A Turcois is opake, and of a color between green and blew.

A Topaze is transparent, and of a color between a grass green and a Saffron
yellow: it is falsely confounded with a Chrysolite, there being a very
discernable difference between them.

II. The less Precious Stones are found either within the bodies of living
Creatures, or without.

Those that are found within the Bodies of Living Creatures are,

1. The Bezoar stone, which is found in the Belly of an Indian Goat-Stag, a
Beast in some parts like to a Goat, in others to a Stag. The Stone is for the
most part of a dark green, yet some are found of a yellowish, others of a Brown
and Olive color. They are brittle and friable, containing oft-times a Straw,
or a small Kernel in the midst of them, about which there concreaseth a slimy
matter baking to it in Blades. There are two sorts of them, viz. Oriental and
Occidental.

2. A Tair of a Stag is a little Stone engendered in the corner of a Stags eye.
It is very bright, smooth, round, very small and light. Its color is
yellowish, mixed with a few black streaks, and gives a strong Sent.

3. The Stones of a Goat are taken out of its Stomach or Gall.

4. There are also Stones found in the Stomach and Gall of an Ox.

5. The German Bezoar stones are taken out of the Bellies of some Does that
haunt the Alps.

6. The Stone of an Indian Hog, or as the Portugueses call it Piedra de
Puerco, is found in the Gall of an East India Hog, or in the stomach of a
Porcupine; it is soft and fat to feel to, just as if you felt a piece of
Castile Soap.

Pearls, that are generated within the Bellies of Sea shellfish, as of
Cockles, Muscles, or Sea-Oysters. These do most gather to the Seashore about
the Spring, where they, (or rather the Sun through its drying faculty) do open
their shells, whereby that glutinous and clear moisture, which they had retained
undigested a longtime in their Bellies, and now being freed from its ayry
parts, does congeal through compression of the remaining thick waterish
substance: which, if they do happen to be engendered, when the sky is dampish
and cloudy, are affected also with a cloudiness, as not being sufficiently
purified through the dryness and heat of the Sun and the ambient air. As long
as they be under water, they are soft; but after a short time lying in the dry
air, they do soon grow hard. When they are taken out of the shell some of the
Fishes flesh cleaves to them, which they usually bite off by covering them for
a while with Salt.

2. The Alectory Stone is taken out of a Cocks Maw. This stone is more
frequently found in Cocks, when they are in their fourth or fifth year.

3. A Bufonite is a Stone found in the head of an old Toad; its shape is for
the most part long or round.

4. A Chelidony is taken out of the Maw or Liver of a young Swallow; its color
is a black mixed with a little red. Sometimes they breed two together, whereof
the one is more blackish, the other enclines more to a red.

5. The Carp-stone is white without, and yellow within, being found in the
throat of a Carp. There is also another triangular stone engendered in the head
of it, besides two long stones more sticking above its eyes.

6. The Stones of a Crab, otherwise called Crab's-eyes, are white and round.

7. A Saurite is found in the Belly of a Lizzard.

8. A Limace-stone is engendered in the head of a House-Snaile.

9. The Perch-stones are taken out of the head of a Perch, near to the
Backbone.

III. The less precious stones found without the bodies of Living Creatures are,

1. The AEtites, or Eagle-stone, which is found in an Eagles Nest, and is of a
light red color.

2. Coral, which is a shrub of the Sea, being green and soft under water, but
as soon as it is plucked from the bottom of the Sea, and exposed to the air, it
becomes red and hard like unto a stone. Hence Ovid. Lib. 4. Metam.

Nunc quoque coralliis eadem Natura remansit,
Duritiem tacto capiant ut ab aere, quodque
Vimen in aequore er at, fiat super aquore saxum.
There are several sorts of it, viz. Red, Green, White, Yellow, Brown, Black,
and of a mixed color. Some pieces of Coral appear to be half Wood and half
Stone.

Crystal waxes upon the snowie Hills; It is often found upon the Alps that
divide Italy from Helvetia. Its shape is hexagonal, the cause is the same with
that of the angular shape of Alume. Authors are at great variance whether it is
generated out of Ice. No certainly, for Ice is nothing near so clear, neither
can it be purified after its concretion. Its Matter then is the subtiler and
purer part of Snow concreased and congealed: for what is more crystalline and
pure then the liquor of Snow, as being purified from all gross parts through
its first evaporation from the waters to the Heavens, and thence precipitated
pure, and freed from its greater part of terrestrial admixture? I need not add
more for to explain its generation, since it is generated in the same manner
that all other stones are generated.

The Haematite or Boodstone is of an Iron color permixt with bloody
streakes: some are more blackish, others yellowish.

The Galactite, or Milk-stone is of an Ash color.

A Marble is a smooth shining stone, admitting of sundry colors. It is known
by three sorts.

1. Alabaster, which is a white transparent Marble.

2. The Porphirstone, which is drawn through with red and white streakes.

3. An Ophirstone whose color is a green, spotted with spots like unto those
of a Serpent.

A Sarcophage, or flesh-eating stone is of an Ash color. It derives its name
from eating man's flesh away without pain.

A Lazul-stone is of a blew color, speckt within its body with Golden specks
like unto so many stars.

An Armene stone is of the same color, excepting that in stead of Golden
specks, it is marked with green, blew, and blackish spots.

The Themeade is a stone which drives Iron from it, wherein it proves contrary
to the attraction of the Loadstone, upon which we shall insist particularly in
a Chapter by it self, as requiring a more distinct and nice search.

The Nephritick stone is sent hither by the Inhabitants of Nova Hispania; it
loo^s greasy about, as if it were besmeated with Oil.

I^s color is for the most part a light green, others are of a mixed color. It
is hought to be a kind of a Jaspis.

The Judaean stone, so called because it is frequently found in Judaa, and in
some parts of Silesia, being friable, and round like to an Olive, of a pale ash
color, having even streaks running down its length, as if they were
artificially marked upon it. The greater of them are called Masculine, the
lesser Feminine.

The Leopard-stone is of a long, round and pyramidal figure, whereof some are
whitish, or of an ash color; others blackish, and transparent, like to
Muscadine wine.

IV. Common stones are either porous and spongy, or solid and compact. The
first kind comprehends a Tophe, a Pumice stone, and a Sponge stone. The latter
is divided into a Rock, a Rock-stone, a Flint, an Emrod, a Whetstone, a
Gravel-stone, an Amianth, a Chalck-stone, a Talck-stone, a Glass-stone, a
Calaminar-stone, and an Ostiocolla.

A Tophe is a stone something harder then clothy Sand, and friable like to it.

A Pumice stone is cavernous like to a Sponge, fit to make a thing smooth with.

A Sponge stone is concreased in a Sponge, being of a whitish color, but
friable; it is otherwise called a Cysteolithe.

A Rock is vulgarly enough known, and therefore needs no description. Rock
stones are great stones cut out of a Rock, wherewith they build houses.

A Flint is unknown to none.

An Emrod is a stone wherewith Glasiers cut Glasses into pieces.

A Whetstone declares it self through its name, whose finer sort is called a
Touchstone, and serves for to try Metals upon.

Gravel-stones are found every where upon the sides of Rivers, and upon Hills.

An Amianth is somewhat like to Feather alume, nevertheless differing from it
in aptness to take fire, whereas fire will not take hold of the Amianth;
besides alume is of an adstringent taste, the other not.

A Chalck-stone is, whereout they burn Lime for to build houses.

A Talck-stone is only commended for a Cosmetick.

The Glassestone, otherwise called Muscovy Glass, is transparent like to an
ordinary glass; and may be cut into very thin Leaves. It is of various colors,
viz. white, yellow, brown, black.

The Calaminar stone is of a yellow color, or rather a yellow mixed with ash,
red, or brown: It is of no great hardness.

V. Pbysiologists do usually adscribe great virtues to most stones, especially
to the most precious of them, possibly because they are bought at a dear Rate,
and therefore they ought to respond in their internal virtues to their
extrinsick value. But let us make a just disquisition upon their Natures.

The Agathe is said to be good against all Venom, particularly against the Bite
of a Scorpion: It makes a man wise, prudent, and eloquent. I should be loath to
rely upon the virtues of an Agathe were I bit of a Scorpion, or to undertake to
cure a Fool with it of his Frenzy: its strength, whereby it should produce
these effects, is very ocult. Venoms admitted through the pores, are to be
expelled with the strongest Diaphoreticks; but I could never hear an Agathe
commended for any such effect. To the contrary, it hinders the Cure of all
poisons, because it is obstructive, unless it be exhibited in a large Dose.

An Asterite comforts the Brain, and cures all its distempers. How can it,
since its spirits are fixed, and do never reach the Brain?

An Amethist represses Vapors flying up from the Stomach, and hinders
Drunkeness: This may be true, supposing they take a great Dose of it, and that
they do not drink above a Glass or two.

A Beril is good to cure a superficial wound of the eye; but Tutia is much
better.

A pale Carbuncle, Chrysolite and Topaze are registered to resist venom, to
comfort the heart, and to drive away Melancholy, and Lust: I suppose it will
scarce work upon a Satyr.

A Chalcedony is good against Melancholy, and makes a man merry; but not
comparable to a Glass of Sack.

A Crysoprase is thought to be good against the trembling of the heart, and to
conduce to the cure of a misty and dim sight: To the contrary, it causes a
palpetation of the heart, and in a small quantity it is obstructive; and for
the sight I always apprehended a green color, as of a Beril or Emerald, to be
more agreeable with it.

A Diamond is praised for its virtue of removing the palpitation of the heart,
and of producing Mirth: but not through any intrinsic virtue, but extrinsick
value, especially to a poor man's eye. They say, that it obtundeth the
attractive power of a Loadstone; very probably that it does, in case it is
included close within the body of a great Diamond.

An Emerald and an Jacinth are commended for their Alexipharmacal virtues
against poison, and for curing the falling sickness.

A Jaspis, Saphir, Topaze, Onyx, Sarda and a Sardonix for chearing the heart,
flopping a flux of blood, preserving Chastity, and promoting travel.

A Ruby and a Turcois for clearing the sight.

How these kinds of Precious stones should produce these admirable effects is
unknown to me. First let us enquire into the truth of the (...) of them, then
of the (...).

As touching the certainty of the (...) falsely ascribed to them, I must
evidence from my own experience that I have often prescribed the chiefest of
them, being besides artificially prepared viz. Magist. Perl. Powders composed
out of Fragm. of Granates, Jacinths, Rub. etc. in extreme weaknesses, and have
very diligently observed their Effects.

The Effects, which I perceived to flow from these immediately after the
exhibition of them, were a present refocillation of the vital spirits, and as
it were a more vigorous motion of the Arteries; but then such pulses caused by
the foresaid motion were very unequal, sometimes remitting, other times
intending in their strength. Besides, this alteration of motion would last in
some not above an hour or two at most, in others not longer then a score of
Pulses, or frequently not above a Pulse two or three after the taking of it.

In the next place, let us search into their (...)

1. We gather that the heart was affected by them, but how? not primarily and
immediately, (as if some volatile spirits had been united to the Arterial
spirits, and so communicated to the heart;) because the spirits of these kind
of stones are so much fixed to their matter, that they are in a manner
inseparable, although endeavored by Chemical diligence; that they are so, is
undoubtedly true to those that have made trial of it. If the real Tincture of
Coral or of Gold is so difficult, if not impossible to attain unto, much more
of these, which exceeds the other by far in fixation of bodies. That the
spirits of these Precious stones are so entirely fixed, their not wearing
though much used, is a manifest Argument, which, if their spirits were volatile,
would as much befall to them as to others. They are much of the Nature of Gold,
which although you expose to the strongest heat of fire, will not yield a Minim
of its weight; if so, then we cannot imagine, that any whit of their volatile
Nature should be separated by our weak heat; if Aq. Regia is too inferior to
separate their spirits from their earth, much less our mild Ferment. But
supposing an impossibility to be possible, viz. that by length of time this
might be effected, yet it cannot answer to the cause of so immediate an effect;
neither must we fly to that worn out Sanctuary of ignorance Ocoult Qualities;
for it is denied to these also to act at a distance viz. To operate presently
from the stomach upon the heart, as soon as the medicament is swallowed down.
. But to keep you nolonger in suspense, the truth of the matter is this; the
Heart, the Brain and the Liver do always sympathize with the Stomach; the one
through commonness of Membranes and Nerves of the sixth pair, the other through
the Branches of the Coeliacal Artery, the last through the Mesenterical and
other Branches of the Vena Portae, especially in extreme weaknesses. This is
evident, Drink but a Glass of Wine, and immediately your vital spirits will
pulsate more vigorously your Animal motion will be rendered stronger, and your
Veins will swell upon it. Wherefore the Stomach being much relaxed in most
weaknesses, and filled with Damps and Vapors, and sometimes partaking of a
Malignancy, does through the same Relaxation by continuation relaxe the
Arteries, Nerves and Veins inserted into her body, whence their spirits are
necessarily rendered feeble and moist. Now then, the Stomach being somewhat
cleared of these moist evaporations, does recover a little strength, which in
like manner the foresaid Channels and Spirits do immediately grow sensible of:
which if so, the case is plain; to wit, that the benefit, which the noble parts
receive, does derive from the depression of these damps, through the weight of
those precious Powders; the same sinking to the bottom to conglomerate and
contract the stomach, by which contraction they expel the aforesaid Vapors.
Exhibit any weighty Powders, as of Coral, Crystal, Bole Armen, etc. they will
refocillate the Spirits, and prove as suddenly cordial (although ex accidenti)
as others of the most precious Carbuncles, or Magistery of Pearl; which is an
undoubted sign, that it is nothing else but their dense weight whereby they
operate those Effects. Neither must you infer hence that I assert, that all
weighty bodies are cordial; no, but only such as are densely weighty, and have
no noxious quality accompanying of them; provided also their weight be not so
excessive, as to overpress the stomach.

By all this it appears, how far Jewels may be said to be Cordial; as for any
other effects that are adscribed to them, they are fictitious and deceitful.

You may Object, that the Tincture or rather Magistery of Emeralds is commended
for its miraculous virtue of stopping a Looseness.

I Answer, That it is not the Emerald, which is the sole cause of this Effect,
but its being impregnated with Spirits and volatile Salt of Urine, which being
very detergent, and almost as adstringent as Alume, do principally work that
Miracle, as you call it; for digest its Powder with any other Menstruum, and
its Operation will vary: Or abstract the Tinctures of any other Stone or
Mineral Earth, (provided they partake of no noxious quality) with the same
Menstruum of Spir of Urin, and you will assuredly find the virtue to be the
same.

Thus much touching their Intrinsic virtue: As for their External Effects,
they are more certain and evident.

1. They do clarify the sight through their Luster and splendour, by obtending
the optic air. They do cheer the visive spirits by moving them gently, and as
it were quavering upon them through their flashes and glisterings of Light.
This is very true; for when you look suddenly upon a great Jewel, the sparkling
of it will immediately quicken your eye-spirits, and as it were by consent
cheer you. The same effect we do plainly perceive in our selves, when wecome
suddenly out of a dark Room into the Sun-shiny Light; wherefore I say the
production of stones are ordained by God for to remain entire, and to please
the eye by being looked upon, and not to be broken into pieces and spoiled, when
they are become scarce worth a Bodel, whereas before their value was of a great
price.

Before I leave this Subject, I will only insert a word touching the cause of
their glistering and splendour.

A Carbuncle, and particularly a Pyrope is alone said to shine in the dark,
although Sennert. in his Phys. does ignorantly deny it. The cause of its actual
light in the dark is an actual flame kindled within the body of the stone, and
there remaining Catochizated, whose Light is further intended by a Reflection
upon the thick waterish parts of the stone, and glisters through its refraction
by angles adherent to the matter and dividing the intrinsic Light. The same,
to wit, reflection and refraction, is also the cause of the shining and
glistering light of the other most precious stones.

VI. Among the less precious stones, the Bezoar, or as the Persians call it, Pa
Zahar The beast it self wherein it is found they call Pazan.
, a word compounded out of Pa against, and Zahar, Venom; that is, a stone
against all kinds of Venom or Poisons. But we here in these parts have a way of
commending a thing far above what it is esteemed beyond Sea, and Quack-like, of
extolling it against all putrid and malignant Fevers, the Plague, Small Pox,
Measles, malignant Dysenteries, and what not? There are many of these
Goat-Stags in Persia And in the Island Vacquas, near the mouth of the Gulf of
cambain, likewise in the Country of Pan near Malacca.
, which are fed in Fields near a place called Stabanon, two or three days
journey from Laza, a great City of that Country. These Fields protrude a great
quantity of an Herb very like to Saffron or Hermodactyls, whereon those Beasts
do feed, out of the subsidence and faeces of whose juice remaining in the
stomach, the foresaid stone concreaseth, which does very miserably torment
their bodies: But if the same beasts seed upon other mountainous herbs, this
stone does happen to dissolve, and comes away from them in small pieces. Now,
that a stone engendered out of an unwholsom and poisonous herb should work such
Miracles, does by far exceed the Extent of my Belief. Moreover Physicians are
very conscientious in dispensing the dose of it, imagining that 5 or 6 Grains
must be sufficient to expel all Malignancy out of the humoral Vessels through a
great sweat; but I have taken a whole Scruple of it my self, to try its
virtues, and found it only to lie heavy at my stomach, and that was all.
Besides I have several times prescribed it to Patients, in whom I never could
observe the least Effect of it. Supposing this stone were exalted to such
faculties, there is scarce one amongst a hundred is right; for those
Mahometical Cheats have a Trick of adulterating them, and so thrusting two or
three one after another down a Goats throat, they soon after kill him, and take
the same stones out before witness, who shall swear they are true ones; for
they saw them taken out.

The Tair of a Stagge does expel sweat extremely, and may be used against
poisons and all contagious Diseases. Horstius commends it besides to facilitate
hard Labor in Women. The German Bezoar stone is fained to excel in the same
faculties that were adscribed to the Oriental Bezoars.

Piedra de puerco some six or seven years ago had acquired a fame, through the
false imposition of a knavish Jew, of excelling all other stones in virtue,
insomuch that there was no disease, but would give way to it. This Jew sought
all the means imaginable to set out the virtues of the said stone, that so he
might entice some one or other to buy it from him at a high price. It fell out
(as the learned Dr. Bate related to me) accidentally, that he came to one Mr.
M. N. house, whose wife had some hours before taken a vomit (I suppose it was a
Dose of the Infus. of Croc. Metal.) against a double intenmittent tertian; The
last vomit made her very sick, as usually it does: The Jew imagining her to be
in an Agony, ready to give up the Ghost, called in great haste for a glass of
Wine and infused his stone in it for a moment or two, then gave it to the
Patient, persuading her it would stay her vomiting (which had then already
stayed of it self; for the operation begun to tend downwards) and infallibly
cure her of the ague. She drunk it off and her vomiting staid, (as I told you
of it self) and her sickness ceased withal, because the vomit had done
working; her Ague left her because she had discharged the continent cause of
the disease by her vomiting. Immediately this stone was cried up for curing a
woman like to die, and for taking away her Paroxisms or fits in an instant.
Soon after one bade him a hundred pounds for the stone, but as soon again
slited it, when he heard the case stated by a Physician. Even so is the Vulgar
through the forwardness of their belief cheated and deceived every day by every
Quacks Medicine, among whom some pay dear enough, and often purchase it with no
less than the loss of their lives. This stone is good for nothing else but for
curing the yellow Jaundise, and particularly against the Cholera or Choleric
passion, which is very frequent amongst the East-indians, who usually take the
infusion of this stone to appease it.

Pearls are accounted for the greatest cordial in the extremest weaknesses,
and to have an alexipharmacal virtue against all putrefaction, Venom, and the
Plague, and to cheer the mind; all this is to be apprehended no otherwise than
I have described the same properties to be imputable to the most precious
stones.

The Alectorite is thought to increase courage, raise lust, and quench a great
drought, if a man do but carry it about him: but this is fabulous.

A Bufonite is praised for a present Antidote against all poisons, insomuch
that some do assert it to change its color when ever a venomous draught is
present. Casp. Bauhin. does discourse very superstitiously upon this, the
Bezoar, and other stones, and adds (I doubt) something more of his own than
ever he tried, nevertheless I should be loath to confide upon it.

A Chelidony is said to cure Convulsion fits in Children if only worn about
their neck; but it is hard to be believed. The two long stones and the throat
stone of a Carp cure convulsion fits; the triangular stone extends its virtue
against the Colic.

Crabs eyes are cooling, drying, detergent, discutient, break the stone of the
kidneys, dissolve blood bruised within the body, and are good in a Plurisie,
Ptysick, and in the Colic. Besides, they are used to cleanse the Teeth.

A Sourite is said to be an Antidote against all poisons.

A Limace stone is used against the Ptysick, and consumption of the Lungs.

Perch stones are taken to break the stone of the kidneys, and to cleanse the
reins; externally they use them for dentifrices and the drying of wounds.

The Eagle stone is by some believed to further labor, if tied to the thigh,
and stays it, if tied to the arm. I have wittingly omitted the inferring the
Draconite, as being dubious whether any such be in nature.


Coral is cooling, drying, and adstringent: It comforts the Heart, Stomach, and
Liver; it purifieth the blood, and is good against all kind of malignant
Fevers, the Plague and Poison; it chears the mind, (but that is doubtful,)
stops a Gonorrhoea, Menstrua, and all loosenesses; it prevents Convulsion fits
in Children; outwardly it heals Ulcers, and brings them to a Cicatrix; it dries
up the rheumes of the eyes. Paracelsus does madly use it for an Amulet to
prevent being bewitched, or ridden by devils, Lightnings, Frights, Convulsion
fits, Melancholy, and Poisons.

Crystal is adstringent, good against any looseness, or abundance of flowers
in women; it is further commended for conducing to the abundant increase of
milk; it breaks the Stone, and dissipates any tartarous matter; whence it is
used against the gout.

The Blood stone is of a cooling, drying, and restringent nature; it stops the
spitting of blood, and binds the belly in a bloody Flux, or looseness;
externally it cures the ulcers and rheumes of the eyes; it consolidates the
ulcers of the Lungs.

The Galactite comfort the Infant in the Mothers belly, increases milk, and
externally cures Ulcers and Rheumes of the eyes.

The Marble stone is only used for building, and to cut Statues out of it.

The Ophite internally breaks the stone of the kidneys; if tied to the body, it
cures the Headache, and preserves the body from the Plague: there are Cups made
out of it, whose liquor infused in them they say expels Venom, cures all Agues
and Consumptions. The stone warmed and applied outwardly cures the Chollick,
Pleurifie, Gout, Stone: all this is but fabulous.

The Lazul stone purges Meiancholly, hence cures all melancholy diseases, viz.
a Quartan, Falling Sickness, Apoplexy, all diseases of the Spleen. It is hung
about Childrens necks for to prevent fights, and to strengthen their sight;
women wear it about them to prevent miscarriages.

An Armene stone is commended for the same virtues against the same diseases,
but is counted more efficacious.

The Nephritick stone breaks the stone of the kidneys if only tied to the arm;
this seems to be dubious.

The Judaean stone is said to provoke Urin instantly, and to break the stone of
the kidneys.

The Leopard stone is used for the same intent.

A Tophe is of little or no use in Physic.

A Pumoise is cooling, drying, and adstringent; it gently mundifies Ulcers, and
particularly those of the eyes, and perduces them to a cicatrice; it serves
besides for a Dentrifice.

A Sponge stone is used against the stone of the kidneys, and against the Kings
evil.

A Rock stone serves only for building.

A Flint is the great preserver of fire; it provokes urin above all other
things if often heated red hot and quenched in white Wine.

An Emrald is of little use in Physic, except in Chemistry; its tincture
precipitates and fixes Mercury in a moment. The Glasiers make use of it to cut
Glass with it.

The Amianth resists witchcraft; externally it is detergent and cures the
Itch; internally, if dissolved with a little sugar in Aqua vitae, it cures
women of the Whites.

A Chalck stone is fiery, and knawing, and in length of time burns a crust.

The Ostiocolla is internally and externally used for to conglutinate broken
bones.

Talck we have spoken of before.

The Glass stone does whiten women's faces, and makes them look smooth.

A Calaminar stone is drying, detergent, adstringent, sarcotick and cicatrizing.

VII. Before I close this mineralogy, I will but name the kinds of mineral
earths: viz. terra sigillata (so called because it is usually selled,) which is
either Turkish, being sealed with Turkish characters, and is sold to us for
Terra lemnia; or of Maltha, sealed with the stamp of that Island; or German,
which comprehends two kinds; the one being of a clayish color is found about
Triga, a Town in Silesia, prepared and sealed with their seal; the other is of
three colors, White, Ash, and Red, and sent from a place in Wetteraw, known by
the name of Terra Wetteracensis, or Lubaicensis. All these earths are drying
and restringent, resisting putrefaction, dissolving bruised blood, moving
sweat, and Cordial. These virtues depend upon a subtle spirit, which is permixt
through the said earths.

Bole armene is a red kind of earth, brought hither from Armenia; it is also
found about Wittenberg in Germany. It is drying and adstringent; hence stops
all fluxes of blood, loosenesses, women's menstrua, and expels putrefactions.

Marle is a kind of fat earth, enclosed within great stones: internally it
dissolves bruised blood; externally, it proves adstringent, sarcotick, and
cicatrizing.

Red Chalck is commonly known; it is adstringent and emplastick.

Oaker is much of the same nature. Red Chalck is detergent and adstringent.

Jappan earth is of a purple color, here and there speckt with white specks,
and of an austere taste; it is commended for drying up Catarrhes, and
strengthening the brain, if held in ones mouth.

Tripolis is a kind of earth of a deep yellow, good for nothing but to scour
brass Kettels.

Dioscorides and Galen do make mention of other earths, as Terra Samia, Melia,
Terrachia, Cimolia, Selinusia, Eretria, Pnigitis, and Ampelitis, but their
virtues being much inferior to those foregoing, they are little taken notice
of by Physicians of this Age.

Among these earths we must not forget that whereout Porcelaine Dishes are
made: there are three sorts of it, The one is of a transparent green color,
like to a Jaspis or an Emerald, yielding to neither in price or beauty, and is
alone to be bought in Bengala, Guzurate, Decan, but at an extraordinary rate.
The other is of a transparent white color, like to Crystal, and is
artificially made up out of a certain paste in the Island Carge, near the mouth
of the Euphrates. The paste consists out of Oyster shells, and Egg-shells of
some birds, called by the Inhabitants Teze, and Beyde and of many others, which
being stamped and mingled with some other materials are buried under ground,
where they are to lie forty, fifty, or sixty years long; Parents showing their
Children where such a mixture was laid, who at the time of its perfection and
maturity do take it out and make Dishes or Pots of it. The third sort is of a
Pearl color, but somewhat more dusky, and is made out of a certain white earth
in the great Province of China, which being well cleansed, sifted, mingled,
stamped, and duly prepared, serves them to make Pots and Dishes out of.

For a Corollary I will insert my sense upon Libavius his mineral flesh, which
he in his Singular. part. 1. fol. 252. infers to be very possible. I shall add
but one Argument: Earth we observe (supposing it to be somewhat below its
Surface (destroys and consumes all kinds of flesh, as appears in dead bodies
buried. How then can she be thought to conceive apt matter for such a vital
substance? For living creatures are generated no where, but where the heat of
the Sun may reach in such a measure, as to stir up, mollify, and vivifie the
substance conceived. Nevertheless near the Surface the aforesaid flesh is
generable, as appears in many square Worms whose shape and form is in nothing
differing from the supposed mineral Mole. Theophrastus lib. de lapid. describes
mineral Ivory, and bones; but you must not imagine these to be distinguished
from stones, supposing them to be generated below the Surface of the earth;
However I will grant you, that real bones are generated near to the Surface
budding out like sprigs; for in Thuringia the same are often found sticking out
of the earth: And Linscot in his voyage to the East Indies tell us that the
Inhabitants of Goa cast the horns of beasts killed for provision into a certain
place within a mile or two from the Town, where they soon take root and spread
themselves into branches.

CHAP. III. Of the Loadstone.
1. The various names of the Loadstone, and its kinds. 2. The Physical Essence
of the Loadstone. 3. An enumeration of its Properties. 4. The demonstration of
the first Mechanic property of the Loadstone. 5. The demonstration of the
other Mechanical properties. 6. Of its nautical property. What is intended by
the Poles of the Loadstone. 7. The division of the Loadstone into Circles. 8.
An enumeration of the nautical properties of the Magnete. 9. A demonstration of
the said nautical properties. 10. The cause of the deviation of the Compass
Needle. 11. An Objection answered. 12. Cartesius his Doctrine examined touching
the Loadstone. 13. The fabulous property of the Loadstone.


I. THe Loadstone is otherwise called a Magnete from the first Inventor thereof
Magnes, a driver of Cattle, who garding his heard upon the Mount Ida, felt his
slip-shoes, being fastened with Iron pegs, to stick fast to the ground, and his
driving staff, which was pegged at the bottom with an Iron peg, to stick first
likewise, whereat he was much astonished, but searching narrowly into the cause
he found they were a sort of stones that held him.

The Greeks named this stone Sideritis, which Pliny, lib. 36. C. 16. derives
from (...), Iron; and not without a just ground, it having a virtue of
attracting Iron to it. Others knew it by the name of Lapis Heraclius, not
derived from Hercules, or Heraclius the supposed Inventor, but from Heraclia a
City of Lydia, where the best were found in great number. The Germans call it
ein seilstein, or a sailstone, because the Mariners sail by it.

This stone changes its name by the places, where it is usually found.

1. The Magnesian Loadstone is engendered about the City Magnesia.

2. An Alexandrian Loadstone is taken up about Alexandria.

3. It is found in Echio, in Boeotia.

4. The worst of them, being spungy and loose, are found near the Cape Verlychi
in Natolia.

5. The best are those of AEthiopia, being the blewet, heavier, and drawing
Iron stronger. Taisnierius supposing them to grow in the bottom of the
Ethiopian Sea, relates an odd story, that some Ships crossing the Ethiopian
Sea, and bearing near to the Promontories should have been drawn to the bottom
of the Sea, by some Loadstones taking hold of their Iron Pins.

II. Before we apply our selves to the enumeration of the properties of the
Loadstone, let us in the first place search into its internal principles.

The Loadstone is (as it were) imperfect Iron, but not so near resembling it as
Iron resembles Steel. It is between a Stone and a Metal, and therefore in a
manner is not perfectly concocted. Its material principle is a loose earth
rarefied by dense fire and incrassated air, being unequally mixed In the iense
ex pressed in the Chapt. of temp.
and tempered. Its forma ultima is sometimes a complete Metal like to Iron,
other times like to a hard reddish blew stone. Both these have been found by
many, not knowing what to make of them, which in all probability were concocted
Loadstones. That they were Loadstones is evidenced by the remaining virtues,
although but very weak of attracting Iron. Its body being throughout porous
(that is loose and not very solid,) its intrinsic parts must of necessity
partake of a certain figure as all porous bodies do, although in some more, in
others less. Iron it self (as also a Lyzzard stone) consists of intrinsic
parts Cuspidally or Pyramidally formed, that is with streaks transcurring as it
were into Pyramidal points. In Alume likewise we see its parts are Hexagonal;
in Crystal the same; and so in all bodies, although it is not always visible,
however appearing in our present subject. The cause you know is from the manner
of exhalation and proruption of the ayry and fiery parts, that have left it,
and minutely do still leave it. Between these triangular pointings we do
imagine insensible cavities or pores, through which those emanations do
continually pass, and by whose figure they are directed to their passages
outward; those I say are continuous and very potent.

III. Now we have declared enough to demonstrate most of its properties, which
I shall instantly enumerate. They are either Mechanical, Nautical, Medicinal,
or fabulous. Its Mechanical property is of attracting Iron: Nautical, of
inclining or moving toward the North Pole, and thereby of directing Mariners
in steering their course, of which more anon; Medicinal, of adstriction and
strenching blood. AEtius lib. 2. tetrabl. cap. 25. gives us this account of its
medicinal virtues: The Magnete or Herculean stone has the same virtues which a
blood stone has: They say that it does assuage the pains of the Gout in the
feet and in the wrist, if held in the hand. This is fabulous, but if applied
being mixed with other ingredients in a plaster, it does really give ease in
some kinds of Gouts. Serapio, lib. de simpl. part. 2. cap. 384. commends the
Magnete for curing wounds, befaln by a venomous weapon; it is to be powdered
and mixed with other Ointments and applied to the part affected; besides, the
Patient is for some days to take a Dose of it internally until the venom is
purged away by stool. Parey lib. 7. Chir. cap. 15 attributes a very memorable
cure of a bursted belly to it. Fabr. Hildan. Cent. 5. Observe. Chir. 31. obs.
rehearses a famous cure luckily done by it by the advice of his Wife (at a dead
lift I suppose) upon a Merchant, who was tormented with a miserable pain in one
of his eyes caused by a little piece of steel that was accidentally peirced
into it. All kind of Anonynes were applied, but to no purpose, at last the
Loadstone was thought upon, which he caused to be held near to the eye, whereby
it was soon drawn out. The fabulous properties of this stone are of losing its
attractive virtue by the apposition of a Diamond; of curing wounds at a
distance, for which purpose it is added to Bombasts sympathetical ointment; and
of preserving youth, for which end they say the King of Zeylan causes his
victuals to be dressed in Magnete Dishes.

I return to its Mechanical property, about which Authors are very various,
some, as Nicander, Pliny, Anton. Market. lib. 2. de occult. prop. cap. 1.
Matthiol. in Dios. lib. 5. cap. 105. Encel. de re Metal. lib. 3. cap. 8. fabr.
Hildan. in the late quoted observe. asserting it to attract Iron at one end, and
to repel it at another. Others affirming the contrary, viz. That it attracts
Iron from all parts, but by several impulses as it were, moving in several
Figures, some being direct, others oblique. It is true in an oblique motion the
Steel at the first impulse seems to recede, because of its changing its
position toward the Loadstone; besides this change the Steel also varies
according to its diverse position toward the stone; we need not confirm the
truth of this by arguments, the experiment it self (viz. placing small pieces
of filings of Steel round about the stone), will g^ve you a further proof of
it. Wherefore these forementioned Authors imagining the North part of this
stone to be alone properly the Loadstone, accused Pliny of an error for
affirming the Theamede stone to reject Iron, which they affirmed was no other
but the South part of the Magnete: Whether the Theamedes does repel Iron or no,
I know not, only thus much I know, that the description of it is altogether
differing from that of the Loadstone; neither can I believe that Pliny, being
so well versed in stones, should so easily mistake in this. Letting this pass,
it is certain:

1. That in the North hemisphere it does attract Iron most at its North part,
and more directly; at the other sides its attractive virtue upon Iron is less
potent and draws more oblique.

2. One Loadstone does not draw the other, unless the one be more concocted
than the other, and then it does.

3. That a Loadstone capped with Steel attracts more vigorously than when naked.

4. That it draws Iron stronger at some places than at others; at some
seasons than at others.

5. That it attracts Steel more potently than Iron.

6. That it does also attract Copper although but weakly.

7. That its Mechanic and nautical virtue is communicable to Iron.

8. That the Magnete loses its virtue by rust; by lying open in the air; by
moisture; by lying near to hot Spices, as the Indian Mariners, who transport
Pepper and other Spices, do testify; by fire; by being touched with the juice
of Garlic or Onions. That in length of time its virtue does entirely exhale,
leaving only a course rusty stone behind it.

9. That a Loadstone being intersected by a section almost perpendicularly
incident upon the supposed axeltree of the said stone, and its pieces placed
one against the other, so that the faces of each section may constitute a side
of an acute angle, terminated by a common point of their South or North Pole,
does attract Iron more potently by far than otherwise.

IV. I should now begin to demonstrate the first effect of the Loadstone
through its proper cause, but before I can arrive to its solution, it will be
requisite for you to know what is ordinarily meant by its North part. The said
Part is otherwise by Authors termed the North Pole of the Loadstone, because it
does look or lie toward the North Pole of the Heavens; or of the Earth,
because it tends downwards withal. Poles are (vulgarly) described to be the
two extremities of an (axis) axeltree, about which a Globe or Wheel moves
round. If so, then properly a Loadstone cannot be said to have either Axis or
Poles, because according to the vulgar opinion it does not move round.
Wherefore the former denomination is improperly attributed to it, viz. the
extreme central point of its tendency toward the Arctick Pole is termed the
North Pole of the stone, and the opposite extremity is called the South Pole of
it. Next remember out of the Chapter of Coct. that all bodies in their decoction do
run off their temperament through streams or small mixtures of the Elements
gradually deserting the decocting bodies, and taking their egress or fuming
through their pores. These pores Suppose them to be transversly contorted
inclining from East to West, and most to terminate obliquely into the poles,
especially the North Pole in its North Hemisphere.
tend most from the transcurrent Axis toward the North. That its pores tend
most toward the North is evident by its intrinsic parts within (as you may
see when it is cut through) running variously intorted toward the North in
streaks; these streaks are distinguished from one another through interjacent
porosities, otherwise they would be continuously one. That the Loadstone emits
fumes, is testified from its looseness and inequality of mixture: For all
parts, (as I have showed before,) that are unequally mixed, suffer a
discontinuation of their mixture, because one Element being predominant, and
having its force united through the said unequal mixture, must needs make way
for its effumation, and afterward break through by egressing fumes: but such
is the Loadstone. Ergo. 2. That these fumes or effluvia do effumate through
their Northerly pores, the experiment it self does confirm to us; For we see
that they attract Steel most at the North side That is in the North Hemisphere
; besides, they usually rub the cross wires of Sea-Compasses at the North side,
as being most effumous there. Thus much for the (...), and part of the (...).
Now for the manner of its attraction; and here it is disputed whether the
Loadstone attracts Iron, or Iron the Loadstone. Hereunto I answer, That neither
the Loadstone does properly attract Iron, or Iron it: However since Iron is
moved toward the Loadstone (but accidentally) by means of his effluvia or
steames, therefore the Loadstone is said to draw Iron to it. 2. Iron does
(improperly) move it self to the Loadstone, being incited to the same motion
through the steames of the Loadstone entering through its pores into its
substance. The streams of the Loadstone are through their particular form and
external shape or figure fitted to enter into the pores of Iron, which are in
like manner fitted to receive the streams of the Loadstone; they being admitted
do reserate the substance of Iron, or through their specific penetrability do
free the volatile parts of that Iron from the fixed ones, whence they do
immediately through their fiery principle dilate and diffuse themselves toward
that part of the Circumference, where they feel the continual effumations of
the Loadstone yet more to unite them, which reeking out, and being further
diducted by a continuation of succeeding parts, do draw the course parts along
with it, as being still continuatly united to them. Or plainer, the said fumes
of the Loadstone having entered the pores of Iron do immediately loosen the
spirits of the Iron, which being dilated and united to the fumes of the
Loadstone must needs covet a greater place, the want of which causes them both
to spout out at those holes, which are most patent; which must necessarily be
those, through which the Magnetical fumes entered. This sudden spouting out
must cause an attraction of the Iron, because the extrinsick air does suddenly
enter its pores on the opposite side, for to recover a place within the Iron
which it had lost without by being driven back out of its place by the
prorupting fumes: This sudden irruption of the air on the opposite side drives
the Iron forwards to that place whence it was first repelled: This you will the
better understand if you compare it with our discourse set down in the Chapter
of Local motion, and of a Vacuum.

These steams of the Iron do effumate through all the pores, where the virtue
of the Loadstone has touched it, especially at the Center of opposition to the
stone, whence they breaking out in great quantity, do draw the body of Iron
directly toward the Loadstone: But if the objected Iron be defended by being
besmeared with Oil or any other greasy substance, or by being dipped into water,
it puts by and obtuses the Fumes of Loadstone. That the Loadstone does effuse
Fumes from it, is further made known to us,

1. Through its inequality of mixture and looseness of Substance, as I hinted
before.

2. Either it must act, that is, attract at a distance, or else operate through
steams; it cannot at a distance, that being only proper to supernatural Agents,
and denied to all natural ones; ergo the last.

3. If you burn it, it will cast a visible blew sulphurecus smoaky Flame.

4. It is not the Iron does primarily effuse steams toward the Loadstone,
because it is more compact, and less exhalable. Hence Scaliger might now have
resolved his Doubt, whether the Loadstone drew Iron, or Iron it. Why these
Fumes do exhale most toward the North, we have told you already.

Do not let it seem strange to you, that the emanations of this stone should
reserate the mixture and Temperament of Iron; it being common to many other
bodies, although Authors are not pleased to take notice of it. The fumes of
Mercury do open the body of Gold. The heat of the Sun opens the body of water,
and attracts Vapors thence. Amber through its Emissives attracts Dust, Paper,
etc. But of these elsewhere.

Why the stone moves steel variously according to its diverse position happens
through the variety and obliquity of its Pores variously and obliquely
directing its steames, and variously withal entering the Pores of the objected
Steel.

V. The Reason of the second Property is, because two Loadstones being alike in
mixture of body, and in Effumations cannot act upon one another; for all
actions are upon Contraries. But in case the one be more concocted then the
other, and in some wise dissembling in their mixtures, then doubtless the one
will act upon the other, and the more concocted will attract the less. The
cause of the third is, that the Emanations of the Loadstone being appelled and
harbored in an extraneous body, as that of Steel, do with more ease and in
greater smoakes (as I have said before) exhale out of it, and consequently
attract Iron stronger, and work with a greater Bent toward the Northern Pole.
Besides steel collects all the egressing steames of the stone, which being
concentrated in the body of the said steel, and consequently received in
greater quantity, must prove more forcible. The solution of the fourth is
containned in the first. The Reason of the fifth is, because steel is purified
from its grosser parts, which did before somewhat hinder the ingress of the
Influence of the Loadstone, and cohibite the Effluvia of the affected body.
Sixthly, It attracts Copper or Brass, because of the likeness of its Pores and
mixture to Iron, whence it does aptly receive the Energy of the Loadstone. The
Reason of the Seventh may be drawn from the Third. 8. The Magnete happens to
lose its strength through Rust, because its decoction is thereby stayed, and
its temperament subverted. Moisture, and its being exposed to the air do lessen
its virtue, because the latter does so much disperse its emanations, and
accelerate its decoction; the former dissolves its temperament. Spices weaken
its attraction, because through their heat they disperse and discontinuate the
emanating spirits; the like may be said of the juice of Garlic and Onions.
Mercury does also destroy the temperament of the stone. Its virtue happens at
last to relinquish it, through the natural course of Decoction. The Reason of
the Eighth is, because the emanations do in that position easily join together,
slowing in like course and figure from their bodies.

Many more Conclusions might be deduced from the Experiments of the Loadstone,
whose solution may easily be stated from what has been already proposed.

VI. Its Nautical Virtue is the great wonder of Nature to all Naturalists, to
whom the Cause is no less stupendous. This Property is, whereby one part of
the stone moves toward the South, the other to the North. Bodintu, Lib. 2.
Theat. Not. proposes an Experiment relating to this Property, somewhat
different to what others have observed: An Iron Needle (says he) being gently
rubbed against that part of the Magnete, where it looked toward the North,
whill^ it stuck to the Rock, and placed in a Balance, does place that
extremity, which was rubbed against the stone, toward the North. The same
virtue it exercises toward the South, if the Needle be rubbed against the
South part of the Loadstone. Neither is the strength of the Magnete less in its
Eastern and Western part, although the stone cannot turn it self toward the
Regions of the world, yet the Iron Needle can. What we have said cannot be
understood unless it be experimented; for if you lay a piece of the Magnete
upon a Board swimming in the water, and lay that side of the Magnete which
looked toward the South before it was removed out of its natural Seat, against
the side of another Loadstone, which before it was cut out, looked likewise
toward the South, then will the swimming stone flee to the other side of the
Vessel in the water: If you should turn the North part of the Magnete, to the
South part of the other Magnete swimming in the water, the swimming part would
suddenly come near and through a wonderful consent be both joined to one
another although the wood of the Vessel be between: The same will also happen
if you put an Iron Needle into a Glass full of water being run through a piece
of a Reed, and hold a piece of a Magnete in your other hand, one side of the
Magnete will attract the Needle, the other will repel it. Thus far Bodinus. The
last Property of attraction does not appertain to this place, the cause of
which may nevertheless be made clear to you by what is foregoing. The former
touching its Vergency, is observable, if it be true; but I doubt he has not
made trial of it: Besides, none else do make mention of it, which were it real,
they would not omit the Observation.

That, which may next be disputed upon, is, whether the Loadstone turns to the
South, or North Pole of the earth, or to the said Poles of the Heavens, or to
neither.

In the first place, I wonder what they intend by a North and South Pole of the
Earth. Those that agree to Copernicus, hold that they are the extreme points of
the Axeltree whereon the Earth does move: Others, who deny Earth a motion,
affirm them to be those points of the Earth that are responding to the Poles of
the Heavens, that is, which do lie perpendicularly or diametrically under the
said Poles. The former Opinion states the Poles of the Earth different from
those of the Heavens. Among the latter, some have consented to believe the
Poles of the Earth to be where the extremities of the Compass-Needles do
diametrically point to the arctick and antarctick Poles; that is, where the
length of the Needle is according to a right Line coincident with the imaginary
axletree of the Poles of the world. The only place of coincidence is concluded
to be near the tenth degree beyond the Fortunate Islands (but that is false,
since the same coincidence is also observed in other places,) from whence for
that reason most do continue their mensuration of the Earths Longitude. But
grant, the Poles of the Earth be at the points forementioned, why shall we
apprehend the Loadstone rather to move toward the Poles of the Earth then of
the Heavens. What? the Earth say they, attracts the points of the Loadstone to
her Poles: An Absurdity, why should not the Earth through the same principle of
attraction draw other terrestrial bodies to it? or what is it they intend by a
principle of attraction? I had thought that among the wandering Philosophers
nothing but Fire and Air had been attractive. Moreover, did the Magnete always
incline toward the Poles of the Earth then it must be exempted from all
deviation, which it is not; for in diverse Meridians it has diverse respects to
the Poles of the World, and consequently to those of the Earth. In Nova Zembla
it deflects 17 degrees toward the East. In Norway 16. About Neurenburgh 10. So
in the Southwest Climates its deviation is no less various. Wherefore after all
this we must be constrained to assert the Magnete not to incline directly
either to the South or North Pole of the Heavens or of the Earth, although, as
I said before, its Vergency is toward the North and South.

The points of the Magnets Vergency are directly tending to the Poles of the
Air: That is, The Poles of the Loadstone are directly coincident with those of
the Air. You see its Poles are primarily neither perpendicular to those of the
Heavens or of the Earth: Ergo its Poles do appropriate a particular situation.
But before I prove their seat, it will not be improper to prefer the probation
of the (...) of their Poles. The emanations of the Loadstone move circularly;
ergo they must have real Poles or immovable points, for a Body is incapable of
a circular motion in all its parts. A real Axis is no less necessary: It being
impossible to conceive two extreme immovable points in a globous body without
being fastened or continuated to other fixed points, (which must likewise remain
void of the same circular motion) and so on from one extreme point to the
opposite extreme point. That the steames of the said stone affect a circular
motion is evident, in that the continuous effluvia of all bodies convert
themselves into a like motion. Does not the thick smoke of Coals, of
Gunpowder, of Boiling water, in fine of all things in the World turn themselves
round in the open air? What is it you can cast up into the air but it will
incline to a circular motion? Do not those little Atoms, that are seen by us in
the Rays of the shining Sun (the same which some Author is pleased to term
light it self, probably because the Sun through its reflection and refraction
upon them engrosses its light, so as to render them, to be light glistering
bodies to the eye,) make choice of a turning and winding motion? Which if so,
what reason is there to move us to detract the said motion from the continuous
steames of the Heraclian stone? Authors I remember, as Gilbert, Cabeus,
Kircher, and others are accustomed to pronounce the Loadstone to contain a
collection of all the properties of the Earth in her, and reciprocally the
Earth to partake of the qualifications of the Loadstone, but without reason:
Nevertheless I may justly set down that the Loadstone is enricht with all the
dignities and virtues of Fire and Air; For as Fire and Air attract, move
circularly, are diffused to the periphery, even so does this stone. Here we may
equally imagine Poles, Axis, Polar Circles, Equator, Meridian, Horizon, a
common and proper motion, etc.

VII. I shall begin with its Poles, whose Axis in most places interfects the
Axis of the fiery Heavens into oblique angles, which in some Climates happen to
be more or less obtuse, or acute, except that about the tenth degree beyond the
Fortunate Islands, and in some few other Meridians its Axis and Poles are
coincident with those of the Firmament. The stone may be justly compared to a
Planet, which as it does in some stations of the Heaven seem to be eccentrical,
in others concentrical, so this may be termed eccentrick or concentrick, or
rather conpolar and expolar. Its greatest expolarity or declination from the
Poles of the Firmament is by Mariners deprehended to be extended to seventeen
degrees. Dr. Gilbert makes them up 23. that is within 30 min. equal to the
greatest declination of the Poles of the Zodiac, but he omits the proof. Its
Center is the body of the stone, about which the steames move round, like the
Wings of a Mill do roll about their Axeltree. Its polar circles may be
conceived to be those, that describe the distance of the Poles of the stone
from those of the Firmament and of the Air. The Equator is the middle circle
imagined to divide the Orb of the steams into two equal parts, viz. of North
and South. It acquires a new Meridian in as many places as its Poles vary in
their declination or ascension. Its Horizon is the Circle equally dividing its
upper Hemisphaere from the lower. Next we will propose certain Theoremes of the
Compass Needle.

1. The Mariners Needle, if gently rubbed against the Magnete throughout its
length, and especially about both the points, does imitate the nature of it,
particularly of attraction, and of inclining toward the North and South.

2. If the Needle be touched throughout its whole length it does tend
Northwards and Southwards with more force than if only rubbed at one end or
point.

3. The Needle being only touched at the South end will only in the Meridional
plage incline toward the South; and if at the North point, it inclines to the
North in the Septentrional parts.

4. The Needle being rubbed about the middle does incline toward the North and
South although very weakly and slowly.

IX. These Theorems, together with the foregoing ones, we shall instantly
endeavor to demonstrate. You must observe, that the motion of the emanating
fumes of the Magnete is from East to West, and from West to East, and
consequently its Poles or immovable points must be North and South, as you may
more plainly understand by this Scheme, where a is mark for the South Pole of
the streams, and b for the North, g for East, and d for the West.



That the Magnete moves circularly in the manner aforesaid is evidenced by its
circular attraction; for small pieces of Steel being placed about it are all
obliquely attracted and forced to it, and not directly; which is an undoubted
sign of the stones circular motion. 2. These Effluvia issuing forth in great
fumes are through a superabundance protruded into small bodies of steames,
which through an overforcing impulse of the air, do as it were reverberate and
move back again, but circularly toward the stone, (like as we see thick smoaks
do in a Chimney) still reserving their natural motion from East to West.
Wherefore it is through their circular motion that Steel is impelled to them
obliquely, and through their reverberating impulse it is forced directly to the
body of the Loadstone. Likewise the extreme part of the Compass Needle, being
impregnated with the steames of the Magnete, which in the foresaid manner
affecting a circular motion from East to West make choice of the extreme point
of the Needle N, for one of its Poles, viz. its North Pole, which necessarily
must remain immovable and look toward the North, supposing its motion to be
from East to West. But if those steames were rolled from South to North as
Cartesius imagined, then the Needle would constantly be shaken by a motion
tending upwards and downwards, which it is not. To the contrary we see, that
the said Needle is very inclinable to move Eastward and Westward, if but
lightly touched because of the steams moving from East to West, and from West
to East; for the motion of the Needle excited by a conquassation moves
circularly in raising it self and moving toward the East, and thence
depressing it self and returning to the West. 3. How can it be rationally
conceived, that these steames should roll from South to North since they cannot
move the Needle that ways, it being fastened at the middle? 4. Hence you may be
resolved, why the Needle being only touched at one extremity does tend
Northwards with a greater force; because its rolling requiring a freedom of
circulating Eastward and Westward, fixes the point Northerly, as being one of
its Poles. Besides this motion obversing about its extremity urges a greater
force upon the whole Needle, because there it and all other bodies (viz. at the
extremity) are the weakest and least potent to resist. Likewise the same Needle
being affricted at its Southerly part in Southern Regions Verges to the South
(because of the Southern Pole of the air,) as that of the North point to the
North in Northerly Countries, because of its imitating the North Pole of the
air.

But if touched about the middle its Vergency is the same, although with less
force, because the weight of the Needle does most resist the impulse of the
Magnetical effluvia at its centrical parts.

Next for the (...), to wit, through what it is, that the Magnete together with
the nautical Steel do accline to the South and North Pole. Here take notice
that the steames of our stone, consisting of predominating fire and air, do
therefore also imitate the nature of both: Wherefore it being natural to fire
and air, if detained from their Center, to continue a circular motion, and to
move upon two Poles of North and South about an Axeltree from East to West, and
from West to East, it cannot but it must also be the nature of all steams as
being likewise detained from their Center to affect the same motion and in the
same manner: For fire and air flowing from East to West like the Ocean, which
has also made choice of the same motion, do carry all igneous and aierial
bodies along with them, as the said Ocean bears all swimming bodies with it.
That fire and air obtain such a motion we shall in the ensuing Chapters
evidently demonstrate. These Herculean steames are also assisted by the
protrusion of the flowing ambient air, because they being continuous and
cohering do give way to the airs propulsion: For if they were contiguous and
their particles dishering, they would scarce be moved by the air, but would
break through. So that it is more than probable, that the steames move with the
air Eastward, Besides, those Miasmata being aerial do of their own nature
strive for rest against the earth, which causes them to move circularly.
Lastly, we are to evidence how the air may be assisting in moving the steames
back from East to West about the Needle; for the air does in our Hemisphaere
continue a westward flood; but this is easy enough.

All flowing bodies do whirl, when appelling against a body that lies or
stands in their way: As for instance, where you hold your finger in a flowing
water or River, there the water whirles or moves round about your finger; or
where there are heaps of gravel or sand lying in the water, there you see the
like effect: Even so it is with the air, which being always in a flood, does
whirl about any weighty body, that lies or stands in its way: Wherefore then
the flood of the air hitting against the weighty Iron of the Needle lying in
its way does turn and whirl round about it, and so does withal impel the
Chalibeat and Magnetical steames to the same course, whereunto they do also of
their own nature seem to incline. Moreover, Iron wrought into a thin long
shape, and insisting moveably and lightly upon an immovable sustaining point
does inclinatively turn its extremities toward the arctick and antartick Poles
of the Air: The reason is, because its steames are led with the stream of the
air, which ever tending from East to West does convey the steames of Iron
(although but weakly, because they do not emanate very copiously from it)
westward, and consequently its Poles must then necessarily be coincident with
those of the air. A Needle swimming in the water (but then it must be still and
thin) does obvert it self to the same Poles; the reason is evident. Supposing
that those steams did cease, and were quite exhaled, nevertheless would a long
piece of Steel, insisting lightly upon a sustaining immovable point be caused
to stick out its Poles North and South, because the air moving in a great,
swift, and full steame enters the pores of the steel, and drives it cross or
long ways, just as we see in a River, which carries a boat or any long piece
of wood (as a Mast) being adrift, athwart or with its cross sides against the
stream, and points its ends to the borders of the said River, which being (as
it were) immovable in respect to the cross drift of the Mast are instead of
its Poles.

X. There wants yet the inserting of the cause of the deviation of the Mariners
Needle: Which being accidental to it, happens through terrestrial and aqueous
bodies condensing and incrassating the air To wit most in its lower region.
, whereby they do somewhat stop and retard the airs swift course only in its
lowermost Region, which being retarded there makes an obliquity in its stream,
since the other part of the air flowing in the second and third Region is
forced to leave the lowermost streams a little behind, which makes the Essluvia
of the Needle and Loadstone choose another Pole. So then about the Fortunate
Islands the lower Region keeps touch with the others and therefore is conpolar,
rendering the Essluvia of the Stone and Needle likewise conpolar. The reason is,
because the air being very thin there, is not thick enough to retain any gross
bodies, such as might hinder its course. Besides, that Climate being temperate
and but little infested with heat is not so much obnoxious to the imbibition of
Vapors or exhalations; neither is it subjected to receive any dense minimas
falling down from the Celestial Poles, which do likewise retard the inferior
Region of the air. Under the Line, and within some degrees of it the air is
likewise retarded by being discontinuated below through the torrid minimas
raining down from the Heavens and reflecting there, whereby it is compelled to
be expolar in a degree two or three, whence also the Needle varies in the same
number of degrees. About Neurenburgh the air in its lower Region is retarded
bear 10 degrees, and consequently differs in the distance of its Poles from
those of the 2d and 3d Region in 10 degrees. In Nova Zembla 17. and very
probably the further Mariners steer to the Northward the more degrees they find
their Compass Needle to linger, because the more remote they go from the
universal flame To wit, the Sun.
, the more they find the air condensed and incrassated with earthy and waterish
minima's, whereby it is flowed in its fluor. And doubtless directly under the
Poles of the Heavens the inferior Region of the Air is altogether immovable,
and consequently its Poles must likewise be admitted to be at the same places.
Further, these deviations of the Needle do signify the Altitude and
declination of the Poles of the air, which altitudes and declinations are to be
conceived nothing else but the degrees of the Airs retardation and acceleration
in the inferior Region, or the degrees which the superior Regions of the air
exceed the lowest in swiftness of motion, which various excess of Degrees seems
to us to make choice of sundry Poles, but in effect does not, it happening
through nothing but through the airs addensation.

Against what I have here proposed may be objected, That although granting such
a motion to the universal tract of the air, yet it is dubitable, whether the
air being separated from its whole body, and included within the limits of a
Compass box does continue the same motion; for water contained in a Porringer,
and separated from its elementary body does cease imitating the course of the
great Ocean; likewise Pools and other standing waters desert that actual
motion, which, if united to the Ocean, they would reserve.

Hereunto I give my answer, 1. That water in a Porringer, Poole, or Lake
striving no longer for a Center, (for it enjoyes one there) does not move
downwards of it self, or is thence circularly reflected as water is, when it is
deprived from its Center; wherefore that motion downwards, which is in the
water in a Porringer, Lake, or Pool, is not caused intrinsecally through a bent
for a center, but by an extrinsick impulse of the air striving downwards for it
center, and meeting with thick water, which it cannot easily pass, it bends and
forces the stronger upon it, that so it may give way. But the air in a Compass
box is still detained from its center, especially by the intercurrent
emanations of the Needle, about whose Namely, of the Needle.
extremity both air and Magnetical steames move circularly together, as upon
one of the Poles. More than all this, the air within the Box is still
continuated to the whole tract of the air, whereby it is assisted and furthered
in its circular motion: Whereas water is discontinuated from its entire body.

But you may instance, That the Box together with the glass atop does interrupt
the continuation of the air within the Compass from its Elementary body
without; or if that did not, certainly the whole Compass Box being thrust deep
under water would, and nevertheless the Needle would point South and North.

I answer, That a thousand glasses or boxes would scarce be sufficient to
hinder the communication of the air, since they are all pervious: Yet I cannot
but grant that the water may; which if it does, it does only diminish the
strength of the Needles Vergency, but does not quite abolish it; unless the air
within begins to be incrassated by water entering in vapors, and then its
circular motion and consequently the Needles Vergency is quite lost and
abolished. Wherefore I conclude, That the air in the Box, although under water
does continue in a circular motion (because of its detention from a center,)
until it is incrassated by water.

XII. But before I come too near to the conclusion of this Chapter, let me take
the leisure to balance what Cartesius sets down upon this matter. After the
enumeration of the properties of the Magnete, he observes that there are
striated particles, that are sent down from the South part of Heaven, and bowed
quite into another kind of shape, different from those that rain down from the
North; whence it is that the one cannot enter into those Channels and passages,
which the other can. He further observes, that the South particles do pass
directly from their seat through the midst of the earth, and when passed return
back again with the air that is cast about the earth, because the passages
through which they pass are such, that they cannot return back again through
the same. The like is to be understood of those particles, that press through
the earth from the North. In the mean time as many new parts as there do
always come on from the South and North part of the Heavens, so many there do
return or fall back through the East and West parts of the Heavens, or else are
dispersed in their journey, and lose their Figures, not in passing the middle
Region of the earth, because there their passages are made fit for them,
through which they flow very swiftly without any hinderance, but in returning
through the air, water, and other bodies of the outward earth, wherein they
find no such passages, they are moved with much more difficulty, and do
constantly meet with particles of the second and third Element, by which they
laboring to expel them are sometimes diminisht.

Now in case these striated particles hit against the Loadstone lying in its
natural position, then they find a clear passage and go through, because (he
says) a Loadstone is pervious in the same manner as the earth is, and
therefore calls the Earth also a Magnete.

The Poles of the Loadstone he states to be the middle points of its passages
on both ends. That, which is the middle point between those passages, that are
disposed to receive the particles descending from the North part of the
Heavens, is the North Pole, and its opposite point is the South Pole.

But when the striated particles, that come from the Poles of the Earth, hit
against the passages of the Magnete lying athwart, then they do by that force,
which they have of persevering in their motion according to right Lines, impell
it until they have reduced it to its natural position, and so they effect that
its South Pole (provided it be not detained by any external force,) turns
toward the North Pole of the Earth, and its North Pole toward the South Pole
of the Earth: Because those particles that tend from the North Pole of the
Earth through the air to the South, came first from the South part of the
Heavens through the midst of the earth, and the others that return to the
North, came from the North. Here you have the chief of the forementioned
Authors fancy upon the demonstration of the properties of the Loadstone. In
the first place, how can any one probably conceive, that there are striated
parts sent down from Heaven; for consider the immense distance, (which he
agrees to) the interposition of thick clouds filled up with dense exhalations,
and the continuous depth of the air. Is not the air potent enough to dissolve
all bodies contained within its bowels, does it not dissolve the thick frozen
clouds into snow, hail, and thick rain? Does it not dissolve the coagulated
exhalations of the earth, that are so tenacious? Much more those striated
parts, which he himself confesses are dissipated at their return through the
force of the ambient air, and that in so short a time and passage. Why should
these striated particles descend more from the polar Regions of the Heavens,
than from the East and West parts? Are not the Poles of the Heavens immovable,
of the least efficacy? Are not those parts of the Firmament always discerned
to be clearest, and most freed from obscure bodies? Is not the North and South
air so much condensed and congealed, that it is impossible for it to give
passage to such subtle bodies as the pores of the Magnet do require? I say
impossible to subtle bodies, because they need force to press through; and so
much the more, because they are discontinuated. But had our Author asserted
them to rain down from the East and West parts, where the air is thinnest, and
less nebulous, and where the Celestial bodies exercise their greatest
influences, it would have deserved a freer reception; but then his Chimera
would have been rendered monstrous, and unfit to explain the reasons of the
Magnetical virtues.

The south streaks (says he) are intorted in a form different from those of
the North: whence had he that news? what? Because one Pole of the Magnete
inclines to the North, and the other to the South, therefore these streaks
must needs be sent down from the North and South: Is this a Mathematical
Demonstration to conclude the cause (and a false one too) by the effect? A
notion by far inferior to those of the wanderers, and that which adds to this
absurdity is to imagine that these streaks should retain their shape
notwithstanding their continual and long grinding against the air in their
descent, and not change their shape a hundred times over. Does not a cloud,
which must be supposed to be of a firmer consistency than those particles, make
choice of a new shape every moment? But how much the more these small tender
bodies? And that which is most absurd is, to propose that such a vast number or
troops of these particles should arrive hither into our North Hemisphere from
the South so obliquely without changing their shape; further he supposes them
to come bearing down directly through the Earth, and through the Magnete, which
is impossible, unless it be in a right sphaere; whereas we here are situated in
a very oblique sphere, and consequently the Magnet is also obliquely seated
here, wherefore it is requisite that these streakes should always beat against
the Magnet in these Regions obliquely, and change their shape very often. But how
monstrous is it to maintain these particles to fly through the Diameter of the
Earth and water, being bodies most dense, close, and thick in many places
shutting out fire and air, being substances by a Million of degrees exceeding
Descartes in subtility; or how is it possible they should pass the most Icy
and deep thick body of water? well, and yet through all this difficulty they
should retain their shape; this is an absurdum absurdissimorum absurdissimum.

The earth is pervious in such a manner as to fit the shape of the Celestial
streakes: and were it so, certainly it moving about the Sun according to his
assent must change its passages and so thwart the entrance of the Celestial
subtilities.

As for the passages of the Magnete, we grant them to be numerously seminated
through its body, but their shape is quite different. My time does even weary
me in making disquisition upon so dishering and monstrous a Chimera; I should
easier give credit to Rablais his Pantagruel, or the Fables of AEsope, than to
so obtuse a phantasm.

XIII. There remains yet a word or two touching the fabulous property of this
Stone, which you have described by Famianus de Strada, Libavius and others,
viz. that two Loadstones, although at a great distance, do so sympathize with
one another, that they move at one another passive impulsion, and that toward
the same place; as, for two friends residing in different Countries, and
intending to signify their meaning or desires to each other, they are only to
make use of two steel needles, of an equal size, and to rub them both against
the same side of the Magnete, and afterward to place them in a Compass Box,
and so turning either of the Needles to any Point of the Compass, the other is
thought to obey to the same motion, whereby they come to know one another
meaning, as having mutually at their last meeting agreed to impose a certain
signification upon each point of the said Compass. Hence they deduce a
Magnetical (or like to it) sympathy in curing of wounds, a sympathy in the
affinity of blood, a sympathy between the guts and their excrements, between
superlunary and sublunary bodies, between men and men, men and beasts, men and
parts of beasts, men and plants, beasts and beasts, beasts and plants, some
natural bodies and others: So that whereas formerly Philosophers used to excuse
their ignorance by occult qualities, now having worn them out they accur to
Magnetical sympathies. There is not a Surgeon or Apothecary so ignorant, but he
will as cunningly find out a cause, whereby to explain the most abstruse effect
of nature, and instantly tell you such or such an effect happens through a
Magnetical sympathy, as the most learned Mr. Doctor. But is this the great
advancement of Learning and Philosophy, which our Age does so much boast of? Is
it not rather a grand piece of impudence to propose such absurdities, and much
more to give credit to them?

If Loadstones are subjected to such a necessary sympathy, then one Magnet
being retracted to a certain point of the Compass, all must yield to the same
point. But the consequence is ridiculous, ergo the Antecedence is no less.

2. This sympathy is either communicable through means of the air, or through
it self without any intermediate body, and consequently a natural action must
agere in distans: not the first; for it is impossible, that its steames should
be conveyed to such a distance in their full vigor; not the second, that
sounding absurd in the ears of all Naturalists. The other kind of sympathies I
intend to treat of elsewhere.

CHAP. IV. Of Life, and living Bodies.
1. What Life is. 2. The Form of Life. Why Vegetables are generated no where
but near to the Surface of the Earth. 3. The properties of a Vital Form. 4. The
definiton of Nutrition, and the manner of it. Whether food is required to be
like to the dissipated parts. 5. What Accretion is, and the manner of it. 6.
The manner of the generation of a Plant. 7. The manner of the germination of a
Plant. A delineation of all the parts of a Plant. 8. What the Propagation of a
Plant is, and the manner of it.


1. HItherto we have proposed to you the nature of Earths, Minerals, and
Stones, which are the lowest degree of natural bodies, and therefore do most of
all resemble their predominating Element in nature and properties; the next
degree to this is, wherein Vegetables or Plants are constituted, and through
whose prerogative a more noble Essence and dignities are allotted to them,
consisting in Life, Accretion, and Propagation.

The life of a Plant is its singular nature, through which it is nourished and
accreased, and does propagate.

As Generation and Corruption in a strict sense are only appropriated to in
animated naturals, so are Life and Death restrained to animated ones; namely,
to Plants, Animals, and Men.

Peripateticks seem to observe a twofold difference of life, viz. Substantial
and Accidental. The former is taken for the principle of the vital operations;
The latter for the actions of life, as Nutrition, Accretion and Propagation. We
here intend neither abstractly, but define the life of a Plant concretely, that
is a living body, substance or plant, to be a being composed out of a Physical
matter, specified by a distinct form from pure naturals, and through its
Essence to be qualified to nourish it self, accrease, and to generate:
Wherefore Aristotle's Followers do justly condemn Cardan. lib. 7. de subtle. and
Cornel. Valor. Cap. 44. instit. Phys. for maintaining life it self to be an
action, that is a quality or property really distinct from its subject; But
withal stumble into no small an inconvenience in defining it to be an Actus,
which is no otherwise distinguished from an action than a concrete from an
abstract: So that in inserting actus they must mean an (substantia agens)
acting substance, which if so, then an accident is not really distinguished from
a substance, and a substance must be conceived to act immediately through her
self.

Aristotle lib. de respir. describes life to be the permansion or abiding of
the vegetable foul with the heat. From which that of Scaliger, exercit. 202.
sect. 5. is little different: Life is the union of the soul with the body. Here
the Philosopher appears only to describe life to be a duration, which is but an
accident; neither does Scaliger's union signify any thing more. 2. They
distinguish the soul really from the heat and body, which in the same sense are
identificated.

The matter and form of life, of a living substance, or a Plant, are originally
the matter and form of the Elements. That the matter of living substances is
Elementary, there are few or none among the wandering Philosophers but will
assert it with me, yet as for their form their great Master has obliged them
to deny it to be Elementary, and to state it to be of no baser a rice than
Celestial. Give me leave here to make inquiry, what it is they imply for a
form: Is it the vegetable soul, which Aristotle makes mention of in his
definition of life? Or is it the soul together with the heat, wherein it is
detained, which is accounted of an extract equally noble with her? Be it how it
will, the soul is really distinguished by them from the matter and from the
Celestial heat (here they take heat in a sense common with Physicians, for
Calidum innatum, that is heat residing it the radical moisture) its subject,
and acknowledged for a form. So likewise the heat (Calidum innatum) is
diversified from the matter and from the soul, wherefore it is neither matter
or form, What then? Their confession owns it to be a body Celestial, and
therefore no Elementary matter. Were I tied to defend their tenants I should
answer that there was a twofold matter to be conceived in every living body,
the one Celestial, and the other Elementary: But then again one might justly
reply, That beings are not to be multiplied beyond necessity.

They do answer for themselves, That it is to be imagined a tie (vinculum)
whereby the soul is tied to the body. So then according to this Doctrine of
theirs I should understand the vegetable soul to be immaterial, and of the same
nature in respect to its rice and immortality with the rational soul; for even
that is in like manner tied to the body by means of the Calidum innatum, and
are both apprehended by Aristotle to be Celestial, of no mixed body, and really
differing from their matter: If so, the vegetable soul must be received for
immortal as being subject to no corruption or dissolution because it is
Celestial and consequently a single Essence, without any composition, and to
which no sublunary agent can be contrary. But again, how can it be a single
essence since it is divisible, and therefore consists of a quantitative
extension, and is a totum integrale? Such is their Philosophy, full of
contradictions and errors.

In the next place I would willingly know, how this innate heat together with
its primogenial moisture may properly be termed Celestial, since it is not
freed from corruption and dissolution, whereas all Celestial bodies are
exempted from dissolution, and therefore the Philosopher takes them for eternal?

Are not coldness and dryness as much necessary per se for life, as heat and
moisture? Are heat and moisture sole agents without coldness or dryness, or are
fire and water sufficient principles for actuating life? In no wise, for as you
have read, they are incapable of existing in one subject unless accompanied by
air and earth.

II. Wherefore I say, That the form of life is spirits or subtilities of the
Elements united in mixtion and a just temperament. Spirits are derived from the
word spiro, I breathe, as being bodies no less subtle than a breath. Their
constitution is out of the best concocted, temperated, and nearest united parts
of the Elements, in which parts the Elements embracing one another so arctly,
minutely and intimately, do of a necessity separate themselves from the courser
parts of the mixture, and so become moveable through the said course parts;
they acquire withal a great force through the predominancy of fire condensed by
earthy minim's, and glued together by incrassated air. The force and agility in
motion of the influent Spirits depends upon the compression of the weighty
parts of the body, depressing the said spirits out of their places (because
they hinder the weighty parts from their center,) which being through their
incrassated air naturally gendred glib and slippery do the easier yield to slip
out and in from one place to another.

The efficient of spirits is the universal external heat, viz. The Celestial
heat, mainly proceeding from the greater mixed bodies contained within the
heavens: For although the peregrin Element's contained within the earth are
capable enough of uniting themselves, and constituting a mixed body through
their proper form, yet they remain unable of uniting themselves so arctly, as
thereby to become spiritous and constitute a living substance; wherefore they
do stand in need of the external efficiency of the Celestial bodies, which
through their subtle heat do accelerate their most intimate union, in uniting
the internal heat (before dispersed through the parts of a body) to a center,
whereunto they could not reach without the arct and firm adherence of some
incrassated aerial and terrestrial parts, which here are yet more closely
united into one, and refined from their grosser parts. Hence it is, that
Vegetables are no where generated but where a sufficient influence may arrive
from the Celestial bodies; and for this reason, the earth at a certain depth
does not harbor any living Creature, as any Vermin, or Plants, but only near
to its Surface. The qualification or gradual distinction of this heat partially
effects the difference of living bodies; for to such a Vegetable, only such a
degree and qualification of Celestial heat is requisite, and to another
another: and withal observe that this efficient heat does not become formal,
neither does it unite it self to the intrinsic heat of a Plant, but exhales
after the execution of its office; The reason is, because it is in many
particulars unlike to the internal spirit of a Vegetable, and therefore being
unfit to be united to it must consequently after the performance of its
function expire.

The spirits predominating in fire reside in an incrassated air, the which
being continuated throughout the whole matter is the immediate subject, whereby
the spirits are likewise extended throughout the same body, and are (although
mediately) rendered continuous.

III. The properties of a vegetative form are to be moveable, forcible,
actually warm, mollifying, attractive, recentive, concocting, expulsive,
nutritive, accretive, and plastic. The two former I have touched just before:
Touching the third, I say those spirits are actually warm, but not sensible to
our touch, because their heat is of a lower degree than ours; however we feel
they are less cold (for in comparison to our warmth they are cold) than pure
naturals, as Earths, Stones, or Metals. This befalls through their fire
condensed, in such a degree and manner, that it kindles the least flame, whose
greatest effect is but the remissest warmth. How fire mollifieth I have
formerly showed: Besides, that which adds much to this is the incrassated air,
whence its parts are rendered tenacious and cohering. Living spirits are
attractive, but how? Not as Novices have hitherto imagined through the fires
egress and appulsion to a portable body, and thence returning as it were laden
with a burden: But through dissipating and feeding upon its incrassated air,
which diminishing, other air ready prepared touching it succeeds and bends into
its room, being impregnated with some parts of the exhaling fire, which it
imports along with it. This new advening incrassated air you must conceive
contains also some earthy minima's and condensed fire ready to take flame,
through which it moves much stronger inwards. That air strives thus to enter
into the cavities left by a precedent air, I shall make good to you in its
proper place. Spirits are retentive through continuing their accidental
attraction, and by means of their courser parts, which being extensive and
tenacious are by the succeding air blown up into the middle parts, where
swelling must needs constrict the upper and lower filaments or containing
parts. They exercise their concocting virtue upon the succeeding ayry moisture,
by melting its body, which done its purer parts succeeds the dissipated
thickened air, because it is compressed upwards through the constriction of the
weighty Elements. The grosser parts being left behind, as not being subtle
enough to follow their finer, are expelled by the exhaling heat, which being
somewhat condensed and corporeal is forced to drive the excrementitious parts
of the incrassated air before it, before it can procure its egress, which is
the manner of the spirits exercising their expulsive faculty: Here we need no
musculs, nor always right, oblique or transverse Fibers, or what not, to
attract, retain, concoct, and expel? For what use could the vital flame of a
tree make of them, since they cannot be extended and contracted into requisite
shapes. The truth of all this I will confirm to you by the burning of a Candle,
where you may in like manner observe one and the same flame attracting,
concocting, retaining, and expelling its nutriment or incrassated air, namely,
the Tallow, and doubtless Vegetables are not differing from these in exercising
the same faculties.

The flame of a Candle does attract the Tallow not by right fibers, or by fiery
parts egressing and returning with their load; for that is contrary to the
nature of fire, whereby it is diffused from its center, but the unctious parts
adhering to the Cotton, and retained within those small villi of it, which being
dissipated, the nearest adjacent parts of the Tallow do naturally succeed, not
to avoid a vacuum, but because their parts are continuated, which so being, one
part attracts the other; besides those adjacent unctious parts being expanded
are diffused by their ambient air compressing for a center into the cavities
between the Cotton, where they are retained. These retained parts are
concocted, that is dissolved by liquefaction, where only the subtiler and purer
parts succeed the dissipated preceding ones, through means of the beforesaid
compressing air; the courser parts are elevated and expelled by the expiring
fire into the form of smoaks. The same may be instanced to you in the burning
of spirits of Wine, wherein the same particulars are observable. Here I do with
purpose leave out the principal part of this notion, whereby to demonstrate the
motion of food to the parts, because I have reserved it (God willing) for
another Volume.

IV. By these four actions nutrition is performed, which sounds nothing else
but the conservation or maintenance of the vital form to wit, the spirits or
vital flames in their matter, or being, by supplying them with new parts
against the defect of the dissipated ones. In this definition you have set down
the in ernal active principle of nutrition, viz. the vital form, spirits, or
living flames, which according to your pleasure you may term Anima vegetativa,
in contradistinction to anima naturalis, so that anima here is synonymous to a
form or internal active principle: The subjective internal principle is the
matter: the end, or rather the bent is to conservate the form in her matter;
the action and means whereby, is generally by supplying it with new parts,
particularly by attracting food or aliment, retaining, concocting it, and
expelling the excrements.

As for the food, It is required it should be aerial and igneous, or like to
the parts that are to be nourished; hence they say Simile simili conservatur;
Like is preserved by like: Here may be objected the relation of the King of
Cambaia his Son, who was fed with poisonous meats, in a manner that when he was
grown up, his blood or rather his skin was so entirely stained with poison,
that flies sucking it immediately swelled and dyed: And of a Girl, that was sent
by an Indian King to Alexander for a gift, which being fed and brought up with
poison killed the King alone by her looks.

The History of Mithridates King of Pontus is universally known, and of the
Ducks of the same Country, that feed altogether upon poison. The inference
hence is, that poison although unlike to the vital spirits (which at most times
it does usually destroy,) yet sometimes becomes a food to them. I answer, that
it is no wise unlike to them, because it does nourish them; possibly at its
first eating, it might be unlike, and therefore it then making them sick was
rejected by their natures; but they by degrees accustoming themselves to it,
their spirits were gradually assimilated to it, and also brought to be
poisonous, as appears by the History of the King of Cambaia his Son, and of the
forementioned Girl.

Hence it follows, that pure Elements are insufficient for food, as likewise
all other substances, that are not igneous and aerial, or such as are unapt of
being converted into a flame. This resolves us that the Chameleon does not live
upon air, nor the Aquarels upon water, nor Toads upon Earth, nor Salamanders
upon fire.

V. Accretion is an action of life, through which a living body is intended in
form, and extended in matter. This action is performed by the same form, and
the same nutriment, but the former growing more vigorous becomes through that
degree of intention of vigor yet more vigorous, and the latter being more and
more dissipated through the gradual intention of heat does likewise gradually
increase through a greater access of nutriment, than was dissipated. This
instance may serve to make a further illustration of it to you: Focal fire does
accrease in form, (that is, intense heat) and in matter or extension of its
quantitative parts by greater apposition of fuel; This fuel at its first
apposition to the fire is not yet attracted or become a fit nutriment for it,
before it succeeds the incrassated air by a continuation, and through an
impulse of the ambient air, and then being attracted it is concocted, and its
aerial parts are gradually adjoined to the former air, where its formal parts,
to wit its latent fire being adunited to the form of the former fire does
accrease the former fire and form, which accretion must necessarily attract yet
more nutriment, which nutriment acceding does each time increase its form and
matter. Even so it is with Plants attracting much nutriment, the which the
gradual increasing of their form and matter does dispose to a greater
attraction, which again a greater supply of formal and material parts do
necessarily consecute. But seeing that all Plants do accrease no further than
to a determinate quantity of formal and material parts, it will not prove amiss
to give the reason of it, which we shall do hereafter.

In order to a further explanation of this definition let us first show you the
Homonymia of accretion.

1. It is taken for an augmentation of number in naturals, animals or others:
Thus a heap of Corn, of Beasts, or of Men is said to be augmented, because it
is increased by access of a greater number of individuals of the same species.

2. It is strictly appropriated to the augmentation of an Element through the
apposition of another Element, or of its own, namely to rarefaction; For
example, Water is said to be accreased, when it is rarefied (according to my
intention attenuated) by the apposition of air.

3. It is understood, for an accrease proper to living creatures, that is such,
as is performed through an introsusception (as they vulgarly term it) of
nutriment, whereby a body is increased throughout all dimensions.

4. Erroneously, for an accretion by adgeneration or apposition; so fire is
said to accrease by apposition of fuel; but this kind of accretion is the same
with that caused through rarefaction.

5. Philosophers intend it sometimes for an increase of virtue or perfection in
a body, as of heat in a fire, or cold in a frost, whence they term it a vertual
accretion.

6. For the accretion of material parts only, or of the Mole or body of a
thing, wherefore it is vulgarly agreed to call it a dimensive accretion. To
distinguish accretion, as it is treated of here, you are to apprehend it for
the accrease of a Vegetable in matter and form, or as they term it both for a
dimensive and virtual accretion.

Accretion is otherwise called auction, or augmentation, which notwithstanding
in a proper sense do differ from one another in largeness and strictness of
signification. Auction is common to all the forementioned kinds of accretion.
Augmentation is restricted to that, which happens through apposition, but
Accretion is only proper to living substances, or to such as is performed by an
introreception of Elementary parts, and whereby they are extended into all
dimensions.

Accretion comprehends in it all the kinds of motion, viz. alteration, auction,
and Local motion: A Vegetable is increased virtually or in its qualities, and
likewise the nutritive actions are performed by alteration: That it is related
to auction the name and definition it self does convince. Local motion is
likewise necessary for the effecting of Accretion, because by its means the
aliment is attracted to the central parts of a living substance.

By the precedents we may easily be resolved, whether a vegetable accreaseth
through a penetration of Dimensions, or by the admission of a Vacuum.

I answer through neither, but by the giving way of the parts, and their being
extended by the succeeding aliment: Notwithstanding you may reply the doubt to
remain the same still; for the succeeding nutriment is either received in a
full body, or in an empty or void one: If in the former, then a penetration of
dimensions must be allowed, if in the other a vacuum must be admitted.

I answer, That in one sense the nutriment is received in a vacuum, that is
void of such nutriment as is to be next received, but not in a vacuum
simpliciter, for it is replenisht with vapors, or air, or excrements, which
are protruded by the advent of the nutriment, and so it is received in pleno.

2. Whether Augmentation be effected through extension of parts, or pulsion.

I answer through both; The first is requisite, because without it Accretion is
impossible, since thereby a body is extended into all dimensions; Neither can
the second be wanted, since the succeeding parts may be conceived to impel one
another forward, and the foremost of them to propel the preceding nutriment.

VI. The first and last of a Plant is its first generation, and its last
propagation. By the first generation I intend the first rice and production of
a Plant out of the Earth without being derived by propagation from any
preceding Vegetable, or in one word its sementation. Although by course of my
method I ought to have treated of this before, yet knowing that the premitted
notions would add much to the explanation of this matter, it did prevail with
me to subjoyn this to them. The earth we spy to be the universal Mother of all
Vegetables, being within her self divided into several wombs, within which she
is apt to conceive diverse genitures or seeds, and retaining he fame until
their perfection, she then casts them forth from her. I shall first make
observation upon the Wombs of the Earth, next upon her Conception, then upon
the Protrusion of her Foetus.

The Surface of the Earth is divided into numerous Wombs of various Figures,
and various dispositions of temperament, bigness, etc. The Wombs of the Earth
that are destined for Vegetables, are small and narrow Cavities, formed by the
transcursions of exhalations and vapors, though their passage impressing that
variety of Figures. These formed are actuated with a prolifick heat (Calidum)
consisting out of part of the heat of the through passed subtilities, and part
of the influent heat.

The Cavities graven within are left rough, and close, filled up with air, or
other thin substances, as vapors; these must needs be rough, because where
ever we see the Earth excavated, it always appears rough, which contributes
much to the conception and retention of the seed or geniture, and so does its
closeness. These Wombs do not remain long ventous, without being gravidated
with some spermatick matter, which is constituted out of the most subtle and
active parts or spirits of passing exhalations, being so arctly knit and united
into a subtle temperament of their Elements, that they might be termed volatile
bodies, actuated most by fire and air. These spirits or volatile bodies cannot
divagate without meeting with some moisture, which does unite them and cohibite
them into one body; nevertheless they continue in making their way until they
arrive to some Cavity, where they may be harbored (or else they may be stayed
by so much moisture as may force them through their intumescence to raise a
womb where they meet,) where being arrived they are immediately cherished and
further actuated, united, and condensed by the close and cold temperature of
the womb. This actuation conceives a flame, because through it the fire happens
to be united, and thence dilated by the incrassated air, whose immediate effect
is a flame; now being come to a flame they attract nutriment out from their
matrix in the same manner as was set down before. The spiritous parts of this
advening nutriment is united to the central parts of the flame, which it does
increase; its other parts that are more humorous and less defecated are
concreased by the lesser heat of the extreme parts, or a heat lessened through
the greater force of the extrinsick cold.

That which is worthy of inquiry here is, Why the heat or vital flame strives
to maintain the central parts; moreover, this seems to thwart what I have
inserted before, viz. That it is the nature of fire to be diffused from the
center.

2. Whence it is occasioned, that the weighty parts, as the dense and humoral
ones are expelled to the Circumference.

For solution of the first you are to call to mind, that the Elements in that
stare, wherein they are at present, do war one against the other for the
Center, which if each did possess, this motion would cease in them; the fire
then being now in possession of the Center contracts it self, and strives to
maintain its place; nevertheless it does not forbear diffusing its parts
circularly to the circumference, because through its natural rarity it is
obliged to extend it self to a certain sphere.

The reason of the second is, Because the igneous and ayry parts being united
into a flame and into a greater force do overpower the other Elements and
impell them to the Periphery, where they being strengthened by the ambient
coldness of the Matrix are stayed, and do concrease into a thick skin; by this
also the internal flame is prevented from dissipating its life, and the better
fitted to elaborate its design, which is to work it self into shapes of small
bodies, of several Figures, and of various Properties, and in those shapes to
diffuse each within a proportion of other Elements likewise variously tempered.
And so you have in brief a perfect delineation of the Earths conception and
formation of Seeds, whose spirits being now beset with thick dense parts are
catochizated, that is, the flame is maintained in such a posture which it had,
when it had just accomplished the plasis of the internal organical parts; or in
some the flame may be extinguished through the near oppression by heavy parts,
which To wit, the latent fire into which the extinguished flame was dissolved.
afterward being stirred and fortified by an extrinsick heat relaxing its
parts returns to a flame. Whence it happens, that seeds may be kept several
months, yea years, without protruding their parts, but being committed to the
ground, especially where the mild heat of the heavens does penetrate, perfused
also with a moderate moisture, do soon after come to a germination. The same
may be effected by any other mild heat, like we see that many seeds are
perduced to a growth before the spring of the year in warm chests, or in dunged
ground; Eggs are frequently harched by the heat of an Athanor, or by being
placed between two Cushions stuffed with hot dungs; Silkworms Eggs are likewise
brought to life by childrens heat, being carried for two or three weeks between
their shirts and wascoats, all which instances testify that the heat of the
Sun is no more then Elementary, since other Elementary heats agree with it in
its noblest efficience, which is of actuating and exciting life within the
genitures of living bodies; possibly it may somewhat exceed them as being more
universal, equal, less opposed, and consequently more vigorous and subtle.

The time, when the Earth is most marked with Matrices, is in the Spring and
Fall, because the astral heat is then so tempered, that it does gently attract
great quantity of exhalations and humors; neither is it long after before they
conceive, the influences of the Stars being then pregnant in subtilizing and
raising seminal matter.

The cause of the variety of Seeds and Plants thence resulting I have set down
above, and withal why it is that (Non omnis fert omnia tellus) every kind of
Earth does not produce all kinds of herbs; but why herbs of the hottest nature
are sometime conceived within the body of water might be further examined. In
order to the solution of this Problem, you must note that the seeds of such
herbs as do bud forth out of the water, were not first conceived within the
water as water, but where it was somewhat condensed by Earth, as usually it is
toward the sides, where those Plants do most show themselves; for water in
other places, where it is fluid, is incapable of receiving the impression of a
womb, excepting only where it is rendered tenacious and consistent through its
qualification with glutinous or clayish earth. And this shall serve for a
reason to show, that herbs germinate out of water, although they are not
conceived within it Except where it is condensed.
. The ground, why the hottest herbs, as Brooklime, Watercresses, Water
crowfoot, etc. are generated in the water, is, in that the spirits informating
those Plants are subtle and rare, easily escaping their detention by any
terrestrial matrix, as not being close enough by reason of its contiguity of
parts; but water, be the spirits never so subtle or rare, is sufficient to
retain, stay, congregate, and impell them to a more dense union (whence it is
that such substances prove very acre and igneous to the pallat) by reason of
its continuous weight.

Next let us enumerate the properties of a vegetable Seed.

1. Is, to be an abridgment of a greater body, or in a small quantity to
comprehend the rudiments of a greater substance, so that there is no similar or
organical part of a germinated plant, but which was rudimentally contained
within its seed.

2. To be included within one or more pellicles.

3. To lie (as it were) dead for a certain time.

4. To need an efficient for the kindling of its life, whence it is, that the
Earth was incapable of protruding any plants before the Heavens were separated
from the Earth, through whose efficiency, to wit their heat, living substances
were produced.

5. To need an internal matrix for its production and germination, which is not
always necessary for the seeds of animals, as appears in the Eggs of Fowl and
Silkworms.

6. Only to be qualified with a nutritive, accretive, and propagative virtue.

7. To consist intrinsecally of a farinaceous matter.

VII. The germination of a plant is its motion out of the Seed to the same
complete constitution of a Being or Essence, which it has at its perfection.
Motion in this definition comprehends the same kinds of motion, which Accretion
was said to do, and withal is specified by its terminus a quo the seed, and a
terminus ad quem a perfect living being, that is a being responding to the
goodness and truth of its formal and material parts. A Plant at its perfection
generally consists of diverse parts, whereof some are said to be similar, others
dissimilar: The former are such as do partake of one matter, and one partial
form, and are destined for one single action, use, or end as they call it. The
latter are distinct from one another in matter, Partial form, action, or use;
whence they are also termed organical, because two or more dissimilar parts
being conjoined prove a convenient organ for performing a compounded action.
The similar parts are either fluid or consistent; The first, being otherwise
known by the name of liquid, are succulent, or lachrymal: The succulent ones
are unctious or balsamic fluidities, contained within the venal porosities of
Vegetables for their nutriment. That their fluidities are unctious appears by
the breaking of a Vegetable and squeezing its juice out, which does manifest it
self to be glutinous between ones fingers. The venal porosities are discovered
by the humors pressed out of a discontinuated plant, and appearing to proceed
out of the o^^ices of long exill channels. The colors of these juyces are
various, some delighting in a milky color as Tithymal; Others in a dark
yellow, (as Celandine,) waterish (as a Vine,) purple, green, and many others,
which do all depend upon the diversity of temperament and degree of concoction.
Lachrymal humors are fluidities proceeding out the pores of a plant through a
(...), or transudation Or by incision
, pressed out either through the abundance of nutriment contained within the
channels, or expelled by means of irritating external heat; among these some
are more aqueous, concreasing afterward into a gum, others like Pitch
changing into Rozin. The consistent or solid parts are either the fleshy or
fibrous parts of a plant. The fleshy ones are the parenchymous substances of a
plant. By parenchymous understand parts, which being fleshy and of an equal
consistency are extended equally into all dimensions. Fibrous parts are like
strings diducted into length, and seminated through the parenchymous ones for
the firmness of the body, and retention of nutriment. These are most right
ones, some few oblique, and as few transverse.

The Medullar substance is a similar part, being spungy, concreased within the
innermost places of a plant out of a peculiar matter. The rind or bark is a
similar part concreased out of the grossest part of the material principle of a
plant.

Dissimilar parts comprehend the root, trunck and boughs or branches.

The root of a plant is the part defixed within the earth, consisting most of
fibrous parts, little flesh, and a rind, and destined for to attract and
prepare the nutriment for the whole plant.

The trunck is the middle body of the plant between the root and the boughs,
formed most out of flesh, some fibers, a vein of marrow, and a bark.

The boughs are the body divided into many dissimilar substances of the same
kind. Sprigs are the same with boughs, and differ only from them as Diminutives.

The excrescent or abounding parts of a plant are the Leaves, Flowers, and
Fruits.

A Leaf is an abounding dissimilar part of a plant, consisting of a loose and
moist flesh, and tender sinews, strings or fibers produced out of the courser
and less concocted part of the abounding nutriment of a Vegetable.

A Flower is an excrescent dissimilar part, consisting of a smooth fine flesh,
subtle fibers, and a thin pellicle, formed out of the siner and better
concocted part of the abounding nutriment of a plant.

Fruits are excrescent dissimilar parts, containing stones or kernels, gores,
flesh, and a skin, some, although but few, having fibers.

The excrements of Plants are either thick or thin: The thick adhere to the
bark, and are worn off by the wind, rain, air, or are propelled by the
succeeding excrements, which force the preceding to fall off. These are called
the moss of a tree, whereof some is dry, sticking fast to the bark like bran,
other is moister, (...) and villous; the thin expires and vanishes through the
air.

Recremental or deforming parts are Knobs, Nodes, and Warts.

Knobs are hard recremental parts of a tree, some sticking out in the bigness
of a head, or fist, some greater, others less; some being latent are also
various in their extensions; others having a cavity within the knob, others not.

Nodes are plain hardnesses of a plant, and usually orbicular.

Warts are likewise swelling hard recremental parts differing from knobs only
in smalness.

Thus far of the integral parts of a plant, which I thought necessary to
premit, and thence to take occasion to explain their particular germination out
of the seed, which continued in its matrix, or dimitted into another does soon
after either receive its flame a new by having its body opened, whereby the
fiery parts return to an union, and being diducted by an incrassated air,
return to a vital flame, which the celestial efficient, together with the
internal disposition of the Matrix, being perfused with a gentle and piercing
moisture, and endued with a sharp heat do concur unto by relaxing, mollifying,
rarefying, and attenuating the intrinsic parts of the seed.

1. The seed is relaxed by a thin piercing humor, or in short by incrassated
air, whereby the close parts are diducted, the heavy ones lifted up and
balanced by other light ones; between every diduction or space between two
diducted parts the flame does vegetate and assume nutriment, being every where
diffused throughout those spaces. The flame it self in the mean time inheres
radically in the consistent parts like the flame of a Candle in its Wieck or
Cotton, into whose pores it attracts nutriment: Whence these flames being of an
unequal and various intention, and their subjects of an unequal and various
extension, do each according to their intention intend themselves and extend
their subjects into a daily accretion of parts, whereby in time they arrive to
their just and definite magnitude, which is stented by the extreme expansion of
their Radical or Spermatick solid parts, and greatest intention of the
spermatick spirits: For the spermatick matter or the seed it self is of that
nature, that being very close tied through its spirits. and radical moisture,
and withal intertext with terrestrial minima's is capable of degrees of
extension and rarefaction, until it appells to the highest degree; within those
degrees of extension and rarefaction it takes in gradually other matter, both
solid, spiritous, and humorous, whereby it discovers its gradual accretion; not
unlike to Gunpowder, which within its bowels contains much fire densely united,
but oppressed and hindered from flaming through the salin parts; yet being
stirred, excited, and somewhat freed from its said oppression, so as to reach
to a flame, it acereaseth in body and flame by the access of the ambient air
being permixt with a proportion of fire, which it draws in for nutriment,
until it has reached to the height of accretion. Whence you may plainly
gather, 1. That the total virtue of Accretion lies hidden in the spermatick
substance.

2. That the accretion of living parts happens through increasing their flame
and extending their solid substance, and by being united to the radical ones.
This observation contains the greatest secrecy of the art of Medicine, and is
the sole basis of most of the Theoremes therein expressed, and withal detects
a fundamental error of Galen, whose tenet distinguishes the influent heat
essentially from the innate heat, whereas the former is nothing else but the
flame of the latter increased by spirits lately advened and united to it by the
last concocted nutriment. But of this more expressly in my Archelogia Iatrica.
Notwithstanding I shall continue the history of Accretion in each part: Through
the forementioned expansion, rarefaction, and intumescence, the circumduced
pellicles, being two in number, differing from one another only in crassitude,
are gradually distended, until at last all the parts being perfectly formed by
the mechanic or plastic spirits in the manner beforesaid, break their
Membranes first (naturally) at the top next toward the Surface of the Earth,
but counter-naturally at the sides.

The cause of this first eruption through the top depends upon the swifter and
more forcible turgency of the light Elements tending upwards; besides, upon the
upper parts being more rarefied and attenuated through their greater nearness
to the influential heat.

The Root erupts soon after its having pierced through the membranes by means
of its weight strengthened by course heat, grows downwards, and spreads into
branches, like the upper parts grow upwards spreading likewise into boughs:
These are more rare and thin, as consisting of a thinner and rarer flame, and
of a thin (yet solid) sperm, which according to the capacity of the same
principles now mentioned do form themselves into boughs and leaves, attracting
every day nourishment proportionable to what was dissipated. The Root does in
the same manner accrease by attracting weighty nutriment, being impregnated
with a dense heat, and therefore can clime no higher; but as for that which is
more rare and thin, it ascends higher or lower according to its proportion of
tenuity and rarity.

The similar parts are accreased out of the more humorous parts of the
attracted nutriment; the solid ones out of the grosser parts of it. The bark
is accreased out of the grossest relics of the Aliment; the fibers out of the
grosser; the fleshy parts out of a mean substance, between gross and subtle,
solid and liquid; the medullar once out of the more unctious and rare parts;
the boughs out of nutriment somewhat more subtle and rare than that of the
middle body or trunck.

The redounding parts draw matter for their accretion fro^e cav^ more waterish
parts of the plant abounding in her, which (...) contain a remnant of all the
similar and dissimilar parts of the whole.

That these are abounding parts, their appearance only at such times when a
plant is not alone filled but over-filled with nutriment does restifie, which
usually happens in the Spring, Summer, and Autumn. Leaves do germinate, when
the said matter is less concocted however supplied in great abundance; whence
it is, that they make choice of a green color, and are expanded into Latitude.
Flowers appear, when the said matter is somewhat more concocted, and are only
protruded out of the better and subtiller part of it, whence many of them
become odoriferous. Fruits are engendered out of the same subtle matter being
yet more concocted, whence it is that most do take their beginning from a
subtility for to acquire a crassitude, (according to this trite one substantiae
coctione evadunt crassiores) whose more terrestrial part falling through its
weight to the center concreaseth into a kernel or stone, whereupon the other
parts do fasten as upon a foundation, increasing daily by apposition of new
matter.

The recremental parts I call so, because they are generated out of the greater
part of such matters as ought to be excerned, but containing some alimentary
ones are retained and agglutinated, whence they chance to be somewhat like and
dislike to the other parts.

Plants are variously divided, 1. Into three species, viz. an herb, which is a
Plant, some consisting of a root only; others of a root stalk, and leaves,
whereof some comprehend (Fruges and Olera) Corn and Potherbs.

2. A shrub is a plant fastened to the ground by a root, and spreading into many
boughs without a trunck.

3. A tree is a Plant obtaining a root, trunk and boughs.

In respect to their place of conception some are said to be terrestrial,
others aqueous; some wild, others Garden Plants: According to their bigness,
some great, others small. And in regard of their fructification, some
fruitful, others barren; or to their germination, some to bud forth sooner,
others latter. For instance the Turnip, Basil, and Lettuce, show themselves
within three or sour days, others in five or six days, as a Gourd, the Beete,
etc. some in eight days, as the Orach; Some in ten, as the Cabbage; (...) in
twenty days, as Leeks; Parsley in forty or fifty; Piony (...) scarce less than
within a year: Many other diffe^ taken from their Color, Figure, etc. I do
wittingly omit.

The propagation of a Plant is, whereby it does generate its like in specie
through semination. This is the last function, that a Plant exercises; for it
must be nourisht and accreased to a just magnitude before it can attain to this
most perfect and complete action.

Semination is the means whereby it performs the same, and is a Plants
bringing forth of seed; this name in the English otherwise sounds a seeding.
Seed is the abridgment of an entire Plant, whereby it does multiply it self
into many of the same kind.

But the great question will be, whence it is, that a Plant obtains this
power, and what Seed properly is.

Here you are to observe, that Seed is twofold.

1. It is that, which is casually (as it may seem to us) constituted within the
Earth through the concourse of the Elements into one body being particularly so
temperated, as to be disposed to germinate into a Plant. Of this I have spoken
sufficiently before, where it appears that it precedes the constitution of a
Plant, whereas the other whereof I am to treat at present, does consecute a
preceding Plant, and is generated by it.

Seed in this second acception is a dissimilar substance, consisting of the
rudiments of all the parts of a Plant, that are to liken the propagatrix (or
from which it was propagated) in specie.

The manner of semination is thus: A Plant having already disburdened it self
of its fullness or abundance of nutriment by casting forth Leaves, Flowers, and
Fruits, there is still a remnant of abundance of the best nutriment, which a
Plant being now exalted to its vigor in its operations through the preceding
Spring and Summers heat does concoct to the highest degree, and a just
consistency, wherein the spirits are united with the solid parts so as it may
be requisite for them to become Seed, each part of the propagating Plant
discharging its abundance that ways, where the passage is most free, which is
toward the top, whereunto the external heat, being attractive, seems also to
contribute: downwards it cannot tend, because the passage is stopped by
nutriment, that is impelled upwards from the root. The said abundancies meeting
in one cavity or passage toward the top of the stalk of an herb or branch of a
tree unite into one, where the contiguous parts consisting most of a vital heat
possess themselves of the center, impelling the continuous ones to the
Circumference, which tie them all close into one, and are as it were a
firmament about them, their extreme parts concreasing into pellicles. This
union is confuse, that is, each dissimilar part is not mixed with the other,
but only glued and tied, (because their arct composition Of each dissimilar
part in particular.
does impede it,) in a confuse manner, that is no distinct shape, figure, form,
or exact order: These they acquire within their spermatick cavities, but after
conception in a womb, where their body being soon loosened, then each
dissimilar part through its degree and proportion of levity and gravity falls
naturally into its own rank and order.

Besides this natural manner of propagation, there is another artificial one
practiced among Gardeners, by planting a sprig of a tree into the ground, or
ingraffing of it into another tree between the wood and the bark, whereof the
former grows up to a tree, the latter spreads it self into boughs and
branches. The some is also effected by thrusting some roots into the earth, as
a Liquorish or Lilly root: Or by planting some kind of leaves into the ground,
as of Indian figgs or Opuntia. This happens by reason those forementioned
Plants are endued with very extensible spermatick parts and copious innate
spirits, each bough being sufficient to accrease to a tree, were it near enough
to the earth to attract proportionable nutriment, but being remote must be
satisfied and increase according to the quantity of access of aliment. 2. Each
sprig of most trees, as also the foresaid roots and leaves containing the
rudiments of all the dissimilar parts, which the whole does, does accrease into
other parts, viz. roots, trunck and branches by the qualification of the
aliment: The courser accreasing about the lower part into a root, the mean into
a trunck, the finer into branches. Nevertheless this is observable, that trees
propagated out of sprigs are nothing near so fruitful, or so long lived as
those from the Seed.

After a Plant has done her endeavor in producing fruits and seeds, she
decreaseth, some yielding yearly, others monthly and daily of their magnitude,
vigor, and nitorous complexion, shrinking by degrees by reason of the wasting
of the spermatick matter and innate spirits, until at last they naturally die
through extreme dryness and coldness, or rather through an entire dissolution
of their temperament. Counternaturally a plant is further exposed to many
diseases, and a violent death distinguished into two sorts, the one happening
(...), whereby a plant is frozen to death; the other (...), through an
immoderate extrinsick heat, extracting, dissipating, and consuming the innate
spirits of a Plant. Either of these may befall a part or a branch alone of a
tree, and then a part of it is alone said to be dead.

CHAP. V. Of the particular differences of Plants.
1. The differences of Roots and their virtues. 2. The differences of Flowers.
3. The differences of Leaves. 4. The three cordial Vegetables. 5. The three
Cephalic Vegetables. 6. The three Hepatick Vegetables. 7. The three Splenick
Vegetables. 8. The three Pulmonick Vegetables. 9. The three Stomachick
Vegetables. 10. The three Lithontriptick Vegetables. 11. The three Uterin
Vegetables. 12. The three Arthritick Vegetables. 13. The specificks for the
parts destined for the continuation of the species. 14. The description of some
rare Plants.


1. ROots differ in Figure, some being long and round, others round like a
Ball, some straight, bowed, flat, others like to some fruit or other; so a
Parsley root resembles a Pear, the root of Kingspeare an Acorn, the root of
Anemone and of Cypress an Olive; besides infinite other varieties of Figure.

2. In number; Grass, Asaraback, white Masterwort, Hemionitis, insist upon many
roots; Aloes upon one, the Mandrake, Sword-flagg, most of the kinds of Satyrion
upon two, Nightshade upon three or four; Vervain, Mallow, and grass of
Parnassus upon five or six; the greater Celandine upon one, divided below into
many.

3. In color, some being red, purple, white, black, yellow; others of various
colors. 4. In inconsistency, some choosing a hard root, as the greater
Centaury, Chim, etc. Others a soft one, as Alexander; some again are hollow in
their root, as Pistolochia; others being unequal or knobby, as Polypody, sweet
garden flag, Flowerdeluce.

5. In taste, some are sweet, as Liquorish; others bitter, as Birthwort: Others
bitter at ones first tasting of it, and afterward changing into a sweet taste,
as the root of Cachou.

6. Some are big, as the roots of a Caper shrub, Mandrake, wild Cowcumber,
Briony; others small, as the roots of Grass, Asarabacca, etc.

Stalks do likewise alter: 1. In figure; some being round, others consisting of
two angles, as Daffodile; some being Triangular, as Cypress; Quadrangular, as
Horehound; Pentagonal, Hexagonal, as Trifole, purple Willow weed; some are
nodous, as some Indian Canes, Soap-wort, Carnations, etc. others are hollow as
Canes, and Elder.

2. In number; so Oreosolinum, and most Trees, usually emit but one. Alica a
kind of wheat gourts sprouts out three or four stalks. Rye six or seven from
one root. Deadly Nightshade ten or twelve.

3. In colors; some are red, black, white, green, etc. others speckt, some are
glabrous, others clad with a wool, as Rose Campion.

II. Flowers differ in their Leaves, some being round, as the flowers of
Woodbine; others bent in, as those of a Flowerdeluce; the leaves of the flowers
of smooth Bindweed are set round in a circle, resembling a clock; The flowers
of Lions mouth are like to a gaping Lions mouth; some resemble a Cone, a Navil,
a Ball, as Bowlwort flowers. The flowers of Foxglove are like to a woman's
Thimble; Many flowers resemble a Butter-fly, etc. Some grow from the stalk,
root, or top; some grow single, and others double, four, five, or six, or a
heap together, as Wall-flowers: other differences are commonly known, as their
color, consistency, smoothness, etc.

The differences of Seeds and Fruits are as many as of Roots, Stalks and
Flowers, which since you may easily gather thence, I shall save my labor of
rehearsing them.

III. Leaves differ, 1. In color: Bramble leaves and those of some kinds of
Blites are of various colors in their leaves: The leaves of Horehound,
Campion, and Mullein are gray with a kind of wool atop of them. The leaves of
Lamium verum have a long spot in the middle of them: The leaves of Othonna and
St. Johnswort are bored through with holes like to a five: Some are hard, as
some kind of Grass and Ditch Dock; others harsh, as wild Cowcumber leaves;
others tender, as Celandine; others feel fat, as Bears-breech, Purslane; some
are glibe and smooth, as Mandrake and Bears-breech; others curling, as some
sorts of Cabbage.

2. In shape; some being round and long, as some sorts of Housleek; Venus
Navel, Monywort, Trefoile, etc. are round; Nettles, Coltsfoot, etc. are
angulous or dented about their extremities. The leaves of Venus Novel and of
wild Teasel are hollow. Grass leaves, Flower-de-luce, and Sword-flag are
pointed: Leaves vary much in their incisures, some being deeper, as those of
Radish leaves, Licebane, Bucks-horn, Plantain, Red Poppy, Vervain; others more
shallow, as those of Nettles. Hercules wound-wort is marked only with five
incisures; others have few or none.

3. In number: The Unifoil is contented with one leaf, the Satyrion with two,
the Tulip with three; Herba Paris and Tetraphylon with four: Other Plants are
full of leaves, as Thime, Asparagus; others are bare. Besides, some come forth
after the flower, as the Peach-leaves. Others come out before the flowers: Some
come forth soon, others late; some in one month, others in another, viz.
Asarabacca, Asparagus, Chaste tree leaves, Ground Ivy, Violet leaves, Willow
leaves, in the month of March: Common Avens, Barbery leaves, Coltsfoot,
Lettuce, Plantaine, Scurvy Grass, Sorrel, petty Sorrel, Saxifrage, yellow
Violets, in April. Agrimony, Bearsbreech, Borrage, Bugloss, Betony, Celandine,
Fumitory, Germander, Marigold, Purslane, Rosemary, Self-heal, Wormwood,
Southernwood, in May. Camomile, Succory, Endive, Fennil, Marsh-Mallow, Melilot,
Mercury, Piony, Rue, Sage, water-Lilly, water-Germander, in June. Bay leaves,
Lavender, Lovage, Mallow, Mugwort, Marjerom, Garden-Cresses, Strawberry leaves,
Savin, Thime, Tansie, Vervain, are in their prime in July. Burnet, Baume, Card.
Bened. Elder, Eyebright, Mullein, Oak leaves, in August. Angelica,
Butter-burre, Cypress, Cumfry, Cinquefoile, Ellicampane, Ellebor, Polypody,
Solomon's seal, Valerian, in September.

Because we will not be deficient in what may appertain to Natural Philosophy,
we shall insert a short description of the choicest Herbs, appropriating three
to every principal, and less principal part of the body.

IV. The three Cordials are,

1. Baume is cordial beyond all Vegetables, excelling in faintnesses and
extreme weaknesses, particularly in fainting fits proceeding from an uterin
suffocation, and is a singular herb in most uterin distempers. In Melancholy,
Convulsion fits, and an Apoplexy it is admirable.

2. As the foregoing Vegetable is so much commended in cold distempers of the
heart, so is a Pome Citron in hot diseases, cherishing the heart beyond
expression when beset with fiery smoaks in an ardent Fever, resisting
putrefaction, defending the heart from all malignancy and poison.

3. Goats Rue is a most famous Cordial, Alexipharmacal resisting and expelling
all poisons, Pestilential Malignancies, and of an unparallel virtue in sported
Fevers, Smallpox, Measels, Convufsion fits of Children, and the Worms.

V. The three Cephalicks are,

1. Male Piony all Ages have observed to be stupendous in curing distempers of
the Brain, particularly the Falling Sickness in men women and children,
chronical headaches; melancholy of the brain, frights of Children, palsy,
Nightmare: It is of a moderate sharp heat and dryness, and somewhat
adstrictive.

2. Garden Rue has been in great esteem among the greatest of Physicians for
its admirable effects upon Epileptick, Apoplectick and Paralytick brains; and
for curing inveterate headaches it is incomparable; It is very hot and dry,
sharp, attenuating and discutient, and flourishes in June.

3. Sage we may admire for its rare properties upon all moist brains, in curing
Catarrhes, Palsies, a lost Memory, dullness of the Understanding, and quickening
all the senses to admiration, being in its prime in July.

VI. The Hepaticks are,

1. Agrimony is the strength, life, and preservation of the Liver, removes its
obstructions, engenders the purest blood, cures all Dropsies, and any kind of
bad habit of body; it is moderately hot and dry, subtle, apertive, detergent
and subadstringent.

2. Succory Nature particularly created for the Liver, and endued it with the
greatest virtue of preserving and comforting its sanguification, opening
obstructions, and of curing all its distempers. It is moderately cool and dry,
detergent, and attenuating.

3. Fumitory never fails of removing all obstructions of the Liver, purifying
the blood from its dross and melancholy, curing the Itch, Scurvy, and yellow
Jaundise, and comforting the Liver through a specific property; it is gently
hot and dry, detergent, and attenuating.

VII. The Spleneticks are,

1. Polypody is the great specific against all splenetick distempers, as
obstructions, scurvies, black Jaundise, Hypochondriac Melancholy. It is hot and
dry, mundifying and gently purgative.

2. The Bark of the Caper shrub being dry and hot, bitter, attenuating and
somewhat adstringent, does thence exert its most noble faculties against all
splenetick distempers, particularly against Hypochondriack melancholy, the
Scurvy, and all obstructions of the Spleen.

3. Spleen-wort is dignified with that name from the certainty and excellency
of its effects in all the forementioned diseases of the Spleen. It is
moderately hot and dry, aperitive and detergent, and is in its prime in
September.

VIII. The Pulmonicks are,

1. Coltsfoot is a most singular simple in helping expectoration, thence curing
all Coughs, Ptisicks, and all other difficulties of breathing. It is gently hot
and dry, and somewhat sharp.

2. Ellicampane is very effectual in all difficulties of Respiration, Coughs,
and comforts the Lungs. It is very hot and dry, cutting, sharp, and detergent.

3. Red Poppy is the sole cold Pulmonick, whose virtue is more then admirable
in a Pleurisy.

IX The Stomachicks are,

1. Roman Wormwood was never doubted to cure weaknesses of the stomach, and to
cleanse it from all its slimy and tartarous dregs. It is very hot and dry,
bitter and adstringent.

2. Ze^doary is very hot, dry and adstringent, thence proves a most excellent
specific to strengthen the stomach.

3. Cinnamon is commended beyond all Spices for a most excellent comforter of
the stomach.

X. The Nephriticks are,

1. Saxifrage: The great benefit which Nephritick Patients have received hence
occasioned the imposition of its name sounding an undoubted breaker of the
Stone, being the quickest and most forcible diuretic of all Vegetables, whence
it does much conduce in all obstructions of the Kidneys, and stoppages of
urine. It is very hot, dry, and attenuating; and is an April herb.

2. Winter-Cherry berries are of most subtle parts in a moderate cold and dry
temperament, and are purposely selected by Nature for those Nephritick Patients
that are of a hot temperament, breaking the stone in the Kidneys most
powerfully, and expelling Urine with no less force. They are most effectual in
August.

3. Marsh-Mallow is an herb of a third sort of Nephrocatharticks, being
moderately moist, hot, emollient, discutient, mitigating all pains of the
Kidneyes, and abating the sharpness of Urine: Even this Vegetable is in nothing
inferior to either of the foregoing, effecting the same effects through its
dissolving moisture.

XI. The Uterin specificks are,

1. Dictamnus Cretius, or Dittany of Candia is a most excellent Uterin
Vegetable, comforting the complexion of the Matrix, reserating its greatest
obstructions, expelling all excrementitious humors through facilitating the
menstrua, producing withal a swift and easy Labor in Women, and is admirable
in forcing a dead Child out of the Matrix: Besides, it is much conducing in all
Hysteric suffocations, being very hot and dry, and penetrating.

2. Mugwort is hot and dry, aperitive, and discutient; cleanses the Matrix,
and excels in the same virtue that Dittany does.

3. Fetherfew is very hot, dry, penetrating, and aperitive, yielding to neither
of the precedents in virtues: It is most efficacious in June.

XII. The Arthriticks are,

1. Sassafras. If there be ever a Neuritick under the Canopy of the Heavens it
is the Bark of the root of this tree, strengthening weak joints, and relaxt
sinews, drying up Catarrhs beyond all belief, and in the Gout it is miraculous,
being hot, dry, aromatic, sudorifick, discutient, and aperitive.

2. Ground Pine is a certain and most efficacious Neuritick, and admirable in
curing the Gout: It is very dry and hot, aperitive and cutting.

3. Germander although the last of the three is not therefore inferior to the
first, but agreeing in the same virtues and qualities with it. Both these
latter are in their greatest strength in July.

XIII. Lastly, to please all parties I shall beyond my purpose recommend three
of the most approved Vegetables to help the languor of the parts destined for
the preservation of the species.

The first is Dog stones, being of a moist and hot temperament, comforting
those parts to admiration, and rendering either Sex very lusty.

The second is Green Ginger, which is only fit to be eaten by those that are of
a frigid temperature, whom it will soon put into a contrary passion.

The third is Rocket, an herb whose seed is potent enough to change the coldest
temperament into a Satyrs lasciviousness. If now your mind tends to the
contempt of this beastiality, then certainly spirit or sugar of Saturn will put
you into another kind of devotion, and better suit with your temper.

Here I have proposed to you a select number of Simples, sufficient to cure
most internal diseases, that are incident to the body of man, whereby you may
be guided out of those dangers accompanying the making choice of them out of
that infinite number of Vegetables, whose virtues you must be forced to take
upon other men's words, often disagreeing with the expected effects: Wherefore
know that each of these (excepting the latter four,) I have experienced many
and many times upon several bodies, not only so, but have had them formerly in
my travels recommended to me by the eminentest of Physicians abroad as the
greatest and most certain vegetable specificks.

XIV. For a Corollary take the description of some rare Plants.

The Parisatico, alias Singady, or the mournful tree grows only at Goa,
Malacca, and some few other places; in shape it resembles a Pium-tree; it does
within half an hour after the Suns going down show it self white all over with
most pleasant and fragrant flowers, Like to those of an Orange tree, whereas at
the Suns going down there was not one to be seen upon it. These flowers stick
fast all night until the rising of the Sun, and then they do all fall off, but
toward the Evening others are spread forth again, and so this continues all
the year long.

Arvore de Rays, or the root tree, is an East-Indian shrub growing up to a
certain height, and spreading it self into branches, from whose top roots do
grow down into the earth, whence they spring out again into other shrubs of the
former height, which again at their top emit other roots downwards in a manner,
that in some space of time this shrub spreading it self near half an English
mile round becomes an entire For^est formed (as it were) out of one continuous
Tree.

The herb Sentida, or sensitive Plant may be a pattern of chastity to all; the
which if you do only touch or cast a little sand upon it, its leaves do
immediately retract and shut themselves up, and do open no sooner again, than
your finger or what you have cast upon them is withdrawn.

The she Palm Trees it is observed do not yield any fruit unless planted near
to a male Palm tree, to which they seem all to incline having their boughs more
extended toward it at that side than at any other, whence the AEthiopians do
usually plant them so, that the wind may carry steams from the Male to the
Female; but in case the male tree be taken away from between the others, they
become barren and give over bringing forth fruit. The fruits of the Indian Palm
tree are called Coquos, being filled within with water; the wight within is
very tender and soft, and tastes like to an Artichoke, but after a longer
maturation grows harder, and eats like a Haselhut. The water, which each of
them contains in the measure of a pint or two, is very clear and pleasant to
drink. This tree contains materials for a whole Ship: Its wood being light and
spongy they cut into planck, which they tie together with cords that are drawn
off from the said Coquos; The sails are made out of the leaves, which the
Indians call Olas.

It is reported, that there is a tree in Java Major, whose innermost marrow is
Iron, being very thin, and running through the whole length of the tree: Its
fruit is likewise as hard as Iron. In the Island of Tylos there are Cotton
trees, whose gourds being of the bigness of Quinces are found to be full of
Cotton when they break through over-ripeness. There is a tree in the Island
Cimbubon, whose twigs being fallen down to the ground do move themselves
forwards as if they crept, having two small legs of each side; and if they be
touched they creep back.

CHAP. VI. Of Water in order to her Commerce with the other Elements.
1. The Etymology of Water. That Water naturally is hard and consistent, and
not fluid. 2. The Division of Water. 3. What a Lake is. The strange virtues of
some Lakes. 4. What a Fountain is. The wonderful properties of some Fountains.
5. Of Physical Wells. 6. Of Baths. 7. Of Rivers and their rare properties. 8.
Of the chief Straits of the Sea.


1. Water seems to be derived from washing, from its use, because people make
use of it to wash their foul things with. So leau in French from Laver to wash,
and Wasser in High Dutch from Waschen denoting the same. Aqua in the Latin was
imposed upon it for to express its excellency, and its absolute necessity for
the preservation of humane life. Aqua dieitur quasi a qua vivamus, nutriamur,
and a qua nobis plurima supersint commoda: Pisces nobis alit, navium vehiculo
inservit, quibus non pauca nobis afferuntur necessaria, ignisque est
pardomitrix, terram foecundans, aeremque spirabilem nobis reddens.

Formerly we have discoursed of Water and its form absolutely considered, now
we are to apply it as it relates to the other Elements and is the proper cause
of her Commerce with them.

Water although appearing fluid, yet naturally, that is absolutely conceived by
it self is void of all fluor, but partakes of the greatest weight, hardness,
crassitude, smoothness, and consistency that is imaginable. I prove it, Water
the more it is remote from the intense heat of the Sun the more heavy, thick,
hard, smooth, and consistent it is: Have you not Mountains of Ice of great
weight, thickness, etc. in Greenland in the Summer, much more in the Winter,
yet more directly under the Poles, and most of all if apprehended absolute by
it self, and deprived from extrinsick air and fire, when we cannot but judge it
to be of the greatest weight, thickness, and consistency that is apprehensible?
The Scripture seems to attest the same, Job 38. And the waters are hid as with
a stone, and the face of the deep is frozen; By the deep here is meant the
Chaos, ergo the waters were naturally at their first creation thick and hard.
Lastly, As there are two fluid Elements, viz. fire and air: So it is also
necessary, that they should be balanced and met with two opposite consistent
ones, namely, Earth and Water. The first being contiguous and hard responds to
fire; the other being continuous and hard responds to air being continuous and
soft. Whence we may safely conclude, that it is the advent of the fire together
with the air that renders the water thus thin and fluid, as we see it is.

II. How Water first gained such a body together as the Sea is, our exposition
of the worlds creation will advise you. The Sea is the greatest collection of
water; by the Latinists it is called Mare, from Meare to go or to flow, and not
from amarum, or the word Marath among the Caldeans signifying bitter, as some
have thought; so it is likewise called Oceanus, the Ocean from Ocior amnis, a
swift current. It procures various distinctions from its beating against
several shores; from those of the East and West India it is surnamed the East
and West Indian Ocean; of the Mount Atlas the Atlantic Ocean; from those of
Sarmatia, the Sarmatick Ocean; near Madagascar the rough Sea, from the
quicksands that are frequently thereabout; of Spain and Britain, the Spanish
and British Ocean, etc. And from the Plage whence it does flow it is called
the East, West, South, or North Ocean. The same spreads it self into many
particular Seas, or great Bays, whereof these are the more principal.

1. The Mediterranean Sea, so named, because it flows through the middle of two
great parts of the Earth, viz. between a great part of Europe, Africa, and
Asia: Or more particularly between Spain, France, Italy, Dalmatia, Greece, and
Natolia of the one side, and Egypt and Barbary of the other. Where it touches
the Spanish coast it is called the Iberick sea; and more forward the French
Balearick From the Buleares Islands, to wit, Majorca and Minorca.
; Ligustick near Genoa, Tyrrhenian or Tuscan; about Sicily Sardinian, Sicilian,
Adriatic, Cretick, Libyan, Phoenicean, Cyprian, Syriack sea, etc. its mouth is
called the Straits.

2. Pontus Euxinus, the Euxian sea, otherwise named the black sea or Mare
Majus, whose mouth is called the Hellespont from its narrowness, its throat
Propontis and the Thracian Bosphor, so called from bos an Ox, as if an Ox
were too big to pass through that narrowness.

3. The Arabian and Persian sea.

4. The Gangetican sea, so named from the river Ganges, which is disburdened
into it.

5. The Red sea, deriving that name not from the color of the Sea, but of the
red sand, over which it flows.

The Baltic From Baltheus a Belt, because it environeth Sconen like a Belt.
Sea, alias the Sinus Coddanus, or Suevick Sea, from the Suevi, a Nation that
formerly inhabited those coasts; at the mouth it is called the Sound flowing
150 leagues far between Denmark, Finland, Sueden, Prussia, Liefland, Pomerania,
and Saxony.

The pacifick sea is so called from the gentleness of the waves; or the South
sea, because it lies to the Southward of the Line, limited by the coasts of
Asia, America, and terra Australis, or the Country of Megallan.

III. A Lake is a great and perennal collection of water cirrounded by the
Earth, whereby it is cut off from the Sea; It is distinguished from a Pool, in
that the one is perennal, the other is apt to be dried up sometime by the heat
of the Sun and dryness of the earth, and to be filled up again with rain: Some
of these being famous for their extent, others for their admirable qualities I
shall willingly insert.

1. The greatest Lake in the Universe is the Caspian sea in Asia, otherwise
called the great sea, the Albanian, Hircanian, Pontick, Tartarian Sea, the Sea
of Sala, Bachu, Abachu, Terbestan, or Giorgian. It diffuseth it self into three
Bays or Gulf, viz. near the Mouth into the Hircanian, on the right side into
the Caspian, and on the left side into the Scytick Gulf. It bears the name of
a Sea very improperly, since it is encompassed by the Earth: Nevertheless it is
saltish and full of fish.

2. The Lake Asphaltites in Judaea, (otherwise called the dead Sea from its
immobility, because as Corn. Tacit. relates that scarce any wind be it never so
violent is strong enough to lift it up into Waves) is noted for sustaining
weighty bodies (especially if anointed with Alume water) that are cast into it,
in a manner that a man his hands and legs being tied and cast into it shall
swim; it breeds no fish nor any other living creatures. The Lake of the lesser
Armenia, and the Lake Aposcidamus in Africa, and of Sicily are almost of the
same strength. On the contrary the Lake Avernum in Campania and that of
AEthiopia are unable to sustain the weight of a leaf fallen into them from a
tree; and according to Pliny, there is no fowl that flies over them, but
falls dead into them. There is a Lake near Lerna, and another in Portugal,
which are so attractive and depressing, that they do immediately draw and press
down to the bottom whatever is cast into them, in such a manner, that a man
having thrust his hand into either, must use force to draw it out again.
Pomponius Mela, and Solinus make mention of a Lake in AEthiopia, which to the
eye appearing crystalline, and sweet to the pallat, does so besmear those that
bath in it, as if they had been duckt into a bath of oil.

In the west of the Isle of Iseland travelers have discovered a great Lake,
fumous and very cold, in a short space changing whatever is cast into it into a
stonish or rockish body: a stick being thrust right up into the bottom, that
part which is under water is in two days changed into an Iron substance, the
other above remaining what it was. Hect. Boeth. writes of another in Ireland,
which after some months renders that part of a stick that is thrust into the
ground Iron; the other part that is under water fliuty, the upper part above
the water continuing wood.

In Thrace it is said there is a Lake, whose water proves mortal to any that do
drink of it, or do bath therein. Many of the Troglodites have forfeited their
reason for venturing to taste of the water of a pernicious Lake in that
Country. The Lake Clitorius effects sobriety in men, and excites them to a
hatred against Wine and Drunkenness. The Lake Gerasa in the Country of the
Gadarens, whereinto the Herd of Swine, animated with those dispossessed devils,
(of whom we read in Luke 8. 33.) violently ran down, is at present so venomous,
that it causes the hair and nails of all those to come off, that have at any
time drank of it.

The Lake Laumond in Scotland, embracing thirty Islands breeds fish without
finnes, and is cast sometimes into a most raging tempest, although there be
little or no wind stirring: One of those Islands is said to fluctuate up and
down in her.

The Lakes of Chirchen in China is said to change Iron into Copper.

Scotland is noted for a Lake, whereof the one half yields to be hardened by
the frost, the other maintaining her fluidity the whole Winter. So likewise in
Norway, although Saturn is felt to be very furious there, yet many Lakes lie
open all the Winter. The like is observable in a Lake near New Castle, which in
some part refuses concretion, although in the coldest weather.

There is a Lake near Nidrossa, whose waters atop are extremely cold, but the
mud near the bottom is constantly boiling hot, insomuch that if you tie an Egg
to a string and let it sink down to the bottom, you may soon draw it up ready
boiled.

Not far from Jensu, a City in China, is a Lake, which is very cold in the
Summer, and scalding hot in the Winter: The same is said of the Lake Jen near
Chinchen in the same Country.

The waters of the Lake Anien, at first feel extreme cold, but after a little
while they begin to feel warm; they also generate stones out of any matter
received from without.

The Lake of Vadimon shows it self sometimes suddenly very turbulent, without
giving any manifest token of the cause of it. The same is said of the Lake of
Geneve or Lausanne.

Italy is dignified with one of the most famous Lakes in the world called
Benaco; its plaisance is supplied by a sight of Olive trees, growing upon its
borders, and beautified about the sides with gardens planted with Citron and
Pomgranate trees, fertilized with rare fish, having its water so bright and
clear, that you may plainly see the bottom through it, except in the middle,
where it is almost not to be fathomed; but notwithstanding so fair a complexion
in good weather, yet appears much more humourous in foul, in such a manner that
it does then cast it self into raging high waves, whereby it proves no less
dangerous and dreadful than a tempestuous sea.

The Lake Larius, by the Hetrusces styled the Prince of Lakes, is much swelled
in its belly through the swallowing up of the River Abda, alias Abdua, tumbling
down from the Rhetian Alps through the Valley Voltilena, Boaring with a swift
stream through the said standing water, which gives it passage without the
least commotion of its body, neither permits it self to be mingled with those
rapid and most limpid streams: The said River persisting in its Velocity breaks
out again near Leuk a Village. In like manner does the River Rhene stream
through the Lake Acronius, and the River Danow through part of the Surian Sea.

Hispaniola is watered with a great Lake named by the Inhabitants Haneygaban,
into which many great Rivers are disburdened, and to the admiration of many is
nothing engrossed, although visibly venting no part of what it has imbibed:
The same is observed of the Caspian sea, receiving the copious evacuations of
the Rivers Volga, Janick, Abiamu, Chesel, and many others.

Lucerna a Town in Switzerland is situated near to a Lake, whereinto a stone or
piece of wood being cast does set it into so vehement a commotion that it
fluctuates upwards in roaring waves, and surmounting its borders happens
sometimes to cause an inundation of the next adjacent fields; wherefore for the
prevention of such inconveniences it is decreed by the Magistrate, that none
shall offer to cast any thing into it upon a severe penalty. The Inhabitants
impure the foresaid exestuation to the pernicious infection, which the Lake
received from the pestilent Carcass of that hellish Judge Pontius Pilate, who
after his banishment was thought to have drowned himself therein, whence it is,
that they vulgarly call it Pilat's Pool.

There is a Lake not unlike to this upon the Mount Tidalu near Chaoking in
China, whereinto if one throws a stone or any other heavy thing, he will
immediately hear a roaring noise like thunder, and soon after the sky about it
grows gloomy and casts down rain.

In Carniola near the chief City Laubach every year about the Autumn there
appears a Pool between some mountains, about a league and half in compass, and
abounding with fish, none apprehending whence this quantity of moisture should
derive, and toward the Spring it begins to dry up, after which the ground is
copiously fertilized, and is haunted with a number of Deer.

IV. A Fountain or Spring is a pereunal eruption of water out of the Earth.

The differences of these is no less various, than of Lakes; to wit, in
quantity, quality, motion, and situation. Furthermore some are artificial,
others natural. We shall only instance the admirable properties of some of the
latter.

Aristotle writes of a Fountain in Thrace (whereunto another in Arcadia named
Styx, as also one in Sarmatia, and that of Armenia, Lydia, and Sicilia, are
like in virtue) which casts the drinkers of it into a mortal Syncope;
breeding fish working the same effect upon those that eat them.

The waters of the Founts of Valentia in Spain, Wolchenstein, Trecha, the
Kingdom of Crobus upon the Alps, Berosus, and of Manglo in China, are all
deleterious, corrosive, and extremely venomous.

Boeotia spouts out two springs, whereof the one called Lethe effects
forgetfulness, the other cures it.

The water of the Fountain in the Island Cea, (as Pliny relates,) being drank
dulleth a man's understanding and makes him sottish.

The Fountain of Susa in Persia loosens the teeth, and causes them to fall
out; Pliny speaks also of another in Germany on the other side of the Rhene
effecting the same.

A draught of the water of Lyncistis fills a man's brain and makes him drunk.

The Fountain of Arania, a part of Arcadia, makes one loath Wine. Isidorus and
Solinus write of two Fountains, whereof the one procures fruitfulness in women,
the other barrenness.

The Garamants make mention of a Fountain among them, called the fountain of
the Sun, whose extreme coldness in the day renders it importable, and in the
night is so excessive hot, that it proves scalding. Aristotle relates of the
Fountain Elusine, which naturally being quiet and clear, is affected with the
noise of any musical Instrument, in a manner, that at its sound it is apt to
sieth and run over as if it were for joy.

Baptista Fulgosius affirms to have seen a Fountain, which appears very clear
and still to one walking about it, and looking therein without speaking; but if
speaking, although but a few words, it is immediately put into a commotion and
siething, appearing very turbulent. The same Author makes mention of another in
France, which being for the most part of a very cold nature does nevertheless
not fail of casting flaming fire from it. There is a fountain in Illyrium, that
like fire burns into ashes whatever is cast into it.

Epyrus and Cyrenaica are noted for Fountains, which in the morning and evening
feel warm, at noon hot, and in the night scalding. The same is said of the
Fountain Ammonius.

For Springs to be cool in the summer, and warm in the Winter is not
extraordinary. In Arcadia springs a certain fountain out of the mountains,
whose water is so extreme and piercing cold, that no golden or silver vessel is
capable to hold it, but is forced into pieces by it; nevertheless it suffers it
self to be contained in a Mules Hoof.

Not far off from the Danow there is a Fountain surnamed the Fountain of the
Holy Cross, which sometimes casts out abundant streams of perfect blood very
useful for the curing of sundry diseases. A fountain in the Island Tenedo does
during the Summer always overflow from three in the night to six in the
morning.

There are three Fountains in Cantabria, that sink dry in twelve hours, and
fill up again in the same space of time.

The fountain Cyane among the Syracusans, as also another in Hungaria increase
and decrease with the course of the Moon. The same is said of the fountain of
Hucune in China. The fountain of Jupiter in Dodan is said to sink and rise
thrice of a day. Another in Epirus does begin to ebb in the morning, is dry at
noon, fills up again toward the Evening, and at midnight is risen to that
fullness that it runs over.

There is a fountain near Weenen generating stones out of any thing that is
cast into it. Many waters, as they drop from the hills, concrease into stones
as soon as they arrive to their rest; and these drops being multiplied
concrease at last into pillars of stone.

The Fountains of Herbogia, Veroniuns in France, Zepusium in Dacia do all breed
great abundance of stones out of and within themselves. Fulgosius speaks of
another in England of the same nature.

The water of Sibaris causes sneezing if drank; those of Clitumnus in Umbria,
Cappadocia, and of Cesiphus in Boeotia make the hair of the Cattle that drink
of it grow wait, but that in Arabia (as Aristotle does arrest) changes them
into a reddish color.

Theophrastus, writing of the Fountain Lycos, reports it to be of the same
property that Oylis of, and to burn in a Lamp, although within the Well
appearing limpid. But that which is more admirable, we observe in the Church
History of Eusebius. whom Paulus Orosius, and Eutropius do second, viz. That near
upon the Incarnation of our blessed Savior, in the Reign of Caesar Octavianus,
there brake out a Fountain in a Tavern at Rome, floating a whole day with
abundant streams of pure Oil.

Isidorus and Solinus in his Polyhistor. make observation of a Fountain,
whereon those, that were to depose their Oath, were to lay their hand, whose
eyes in case they had forsworn themselves were withered, and brought to a
blindness. Had God pleased that such a fountain might have appeared near the
Hals, it is to be feared that an honest man could hardly walk the streets
without being affronted by a blind man.

One of the same Authors does also witness of Jacobs Fountain in Idumaea, that
every three months it grows troubled and becomes red and green, afterward
returning to its primitive clearness. Likewise it is said of a fountain in
Cherronesus that it sieths and ferments once a year, purging it self of all
filth and uncleanness. The same is observed of many other fountains.

From the likeness of the subject I shall take occasion to appose a word or two
touching the properties of some eminent Wells and Baths, differing in little
else from fountains, than that these spout out of the earth with a great force
and in greater abundance.

IV. Near to this City there are three Wells much cried up for the cure of
diseases, whereof two are purging by stool and urine, viz. Barnet and Ipsum
Wells; The other of Tunbridge is only diuretic or moving urin. Of the two
first the latter is counted the stronger, both being much approved for the
curing all chronicall diseases; particularly a Tertian Ague, obstructions of
the mesaraick vessels, of the Liver and Spleen, crudities of the stomach, the
yellow Jaundise, and Catarrhs.

That of Tunbridge is more profitable in Quartanes, inveterate Headaches,
Dropsies, Gouts, Hypochondriack Melancholy, black Jaundise, Melancholy of the
brain, Leprosy, Cancers, malignant and inveterate Ulcers, Kings Evil,
Convulsion sits, sits of the Mother, stoppage of Courses, VVhites, Phtisicks,
Palpitation of the heart, stoppage of the Kidneys and Bladder, the Gravel and
Stone, the Impostume of the Kidneys, of the Mesentery, of the Liver and Spleen.
But as for those that are troubled with the French Leprosy, let them beware
from these waters as from poison; for there is nothing in the world that sets
those virulent humors more into rage and fury than Mineral waters.

Next to these the Spaw waters are very famous, divided into four several
Wells, viz. Savenier, opening at the foot of a hillock three miles from Spaw,
its faculty is most diuretic and somewhat Eccoprotick. 2. Pouhont bursts out
in the middle of the Village, and agrees much in virtue with that of Savenier,
excepting that it is somewhat more eccoprotick. They are both much coveted for
their pleasing sharpness of taste. 3. Geronster is distent from Spaw near three
miles, but is much less in esteem than others, because of its unpleasing
nauseous sharp taste, causing a disturbance of the brain, stomach, bladder, and
guts. 4. Tonnelet retains some faculties like to the before mentioned, but much
inferior to them in strength.

V. Baths are hot Wells: hence in Latin they are called Thermae (hot)
scil^aquae, from (...) hot. This Island affords some inferior to none:
Especially those in Somersetshire, whose fame has deserved the name of Baths
(...) for the Town, where they erupt out of the earth.

They are 1. Cross-bath, pouring out in a mild temperate heat.

2. Hot bath, being about two hundred foot distant from the former, and
differing from the other in intenseness of heat, whence also it derives its
name.

3. Kings bath, which is near to the Cathedral, and is less hot than the Hot
bath, but hotter than the Cross bath. Their virtues are excellent in curing of
most chronical diseases incident to the joints and sinews; as Gouts,
Lamenesses, Numnesses, Palsies, hard nodes and cold tumors of the joints,
Rickets in children, etc. they dry up the superfluous moisture in dropsies,
expel gross humors by sweat, and by that means curing inve^erate headaches,
aches of the Limbs; they procure women's courses, consume their Whites, cure the
Green Sickness and many other diseases.

VI. A River is a collection of waters descending from a Fountain, and
streaming through a tract of the earth toward the Sea, whereof some are long,
others short, broad or narrow, deep or shallow, swift or slow, straight or
winding; some ebbing and flowing, as the Thames, Elb, Mase, Seyne, etc. others
for the most part following one course, etc.

Most of the River Waters about the Alps, if usually drank of are apt to breed
a great swelling in the throat, called by Physicians Bronchocele.

Vitruvius affirms the same of a River called Silar, changing the roots,
leaves, and boughs of the trees that grow on its banks side into stones. Pliny
adduces another of the same property, whereunto the River near Laodicea, and
those of the Country of Barcia in Hungary may be adjoined. About the borders of
Norway, near a Castle called New Castle, flows a River, whose streams seem
blackish, breeding also fish of the same color.

Philostratus, in his book de vita Apoll. recites a Fountain, wherein if a
forsworn person does wash his hands or feet, he is soon infected with a
shameful leprosy. Diodorus the Sicilian makes mention of another of the same
nature.

The water of the River of Jordan does still retain its great fame among the
Papists of working Miracles: Pilgrims do often bring quantity of it along with
them thence, obtesting that it is impossible it should fail curing Dropsies,
Consumptions, malignant Ulcers, Kings Evil, Barrenness, in fine all diseases
that surpass cure by Art. It renders the face beautiful and nitourous, and for
cuting spots and deforming rednesses of the face it is taken notice of by most
women in Spain, France, and Italy.

The East Indians do adscribe the same virtues to the River Ganges, which they
do believe with such an assurance, that as soon as ever they fall dangerously
sick, they cause themselves to be carried to the River side, where they sit
under a Hutt with their legs half way in the water so long until they are
either dead, or perfectly cured; and if they die they leave in their last will
that their cinders may be cast into the same River, for to be purified (I
suppose) against their Resurrection.

The Egyptians used to take their prognostica ions of sundry important things
from the River Nilus, which if it failed overflowing their Country, portended
barrenness, and consequently Famine, and often times a Pestilential disease, and
sometime change of Government. Thus its inundation was deficient two years
together before the death of Antonius and Cleopatra; the same happened also
before the great Famine and change of Government under Claudins. On the other
side, if the said River happen to overflow beyond its usual limits, it proves
likewise an occasion of barrenness, because the length of time, before the
Country can return to a just dryness through the decrescence of the water, is
protracted beyond the Season of Sowing. Usually and naturally (as I may so say)
the Nile overflowes once a year, being forty days in increasing, arriveth to
its height (which is unto 16 cubits) about the seventeenth day of June, and is
forty days more after that in decreasing. The Country being much fatned by
this inundation produces great abundance of pasture, corn, and other fruits.

The increase, height, and decrease of the Nile they know from the observation
of a Pit made out of one stone, whose water increases and decreases with the
Nile. This River does also dispose women for conception, whence it is ordinary
with them to multiply by twins, and three at one birth: Moreover it is a very
healthful water preserving the body in a good disposition, and curing many
diseases. Notwithstanding the subtility of the water and heat of the climate,
yet it never emits vapors, whence it is that there falls no rain in that
Country. The same is also attributed to the River Boristhenes and the Anouros
in Thessalia, viz. not to rick or to occasion the air to be nebulous.

The River Ganges is likewise apt sometimes to exceed its bounds, through which
inundation the Country is very much fertilized. The River Arrius of Florence,
the Danow, the Eridanus or Padus, the Tiberis, and the Athesis of Verona, have
often caused a submersion of the neighboring fields.

VIII. The chief straits These should have have been inserted in the preceding
Chap.
or narrownesses of the sea are,

1. The straits of Gibraltar, where the Sea floats through betwixt the two
pillars of Hercules, viz. The two Promontories of Calpe and Abila, and divides
Spain from Fez; it is otherwise called the straits of Caliz from the Island
Caliz, near adjacent to it. Its breadth is about seven Leagues.

2. The straits of Anjan passing from the outermost western parts of America to
the Eastern Coasts of Tartary. It is very probable that some of the posterity
of Sem crossed these straits to inhabit the West Indies, where they are since
multiplied into those several nations.

3. The straits of Magallan, so called from him that first passed them; but
since they have found another way into the Pacifick Sea more commodious to sail
through, called the straits of Le maire.

4. The straits of Davis toward Greenland.

5. The straits of Nassow or Waigats near Nova Zembla.

The Mediterranean is pinched by these straits: 1. The Sicili^n straits. 2. The
Tuscan straits between Sardinia and Corsica. 3. The Calydonian straits. 4. The
straits of Euripus between Achaia and Euboea. 5. The straits of the Hellespont.
6. The Thracian straits. 7. The Cimmerian or Meotian straits. 8. The straits of
Cilicia or Caramania between Cilicia and Cyprus.

A Gulf is an arm of the Sea, or the Sea broken into the Earth in the form of
an Arm. The principal Gulphs of the Oriental Ocean are:

1. The great Gulf passing betwixt Maugi and India extra Gangem.

2. The Gangetican Gulf streaming between the Golden Chersonesus and India
intra Gangem.

3. The Persian Gulf.

4. The Gulf of Arabia, or the red or Eruthrean Sea deriving its name from the
red Sands over which it floats, or according to Q. Curtius from the King
Eristhra.

5. The Gulf of Canthus.

6. The Gulf of Barbary, or Progloatis, or di Melinde. The principal Gulphs of
the Western Ocean:

1. The Sarmatian Gulf. 2. The Granduican Gulf, or white Sea. 3. The Gulf of
Mexico. 4. The Bay of Biscay.
The Mediterranean Sea is chiefly dispersed into these Gulphs:

1. The Gulf of France reaching Marseilles. 2. The Adriatic or Venetian
Gulf. 3. The Ionian Gulf floating toward Epirus and Macedonia. 4. The
Corinthian Gulf, alias the Crisean or Alcionian Sea. 5. The Gulf of Naples.
6. The Pamphilian or Issican Gulf. 7. The Thermacian or Thessalonian Gulf. 8.
The Argolick Gulf. 9. The black Gulf.
CHAP. VII. Of the Circulation of the Ocean.
1. That the disburdening of the Eastern Rivers into the Ocean is not the cause
of its Circulation; neither are the Sun or Moon the principal causes of this
motion. 2. The periodical course of the Ocean. The causes of the high and low
waters of the Ocean. 3. How it is possible that the Ocean should move so
swiftly as in 24 hours and somewhat more to flow about the terrestrial Globe.
4. A further Explanation of the causes of the intumescence and detumescence of
the Ocean. The causes of the anticipation of the flood of the Ocean. 5. That
the Suns intense heat in the torrid Zone is a potent adjuvant cause of the
Oceans Circulation, and likewise the minima's descending from the Moon and the
Polar Regions.


I. HAving in one of the Chapt. of the precedent Book posed a demonstrative and
evident ground of the universal course of the great Ocean, and the straitness
of that Chapt. not permitting the finishing of the fabric intended by us upon
it: Therefore this present plain shall serve for to complete the delineation
thereof, but encountering with some rocky stones thereon, it is requisite they
should be rolled aside, before the said Atlantic waves may procure a necessary
assent of the true cause of their daily circular floating.

The conceit of some Philosophers has induced them to state the copious
irreption of many large and deep Rivers into the Eoan Sea for the principal
cause of its circulation, the which tumefying its body do thereby press it
westward. This solution seems void of all reason, the evacuation of the
presupposed Rivers having no proportion to the replenishing of so extended a
body as the Ocean, scarce of a Lake or an inland Sea, as we have observed of
the lake Haneygaban, and the Euxian Sea. Besides many great Rivers disburdening
themselves into the Occiduan Sea might upon the same ground return the course
of the Ocean Eastward. But imagine it was so, why should not the said
tumefaction rather incline the sea westward, than further eastward? Others
rejecting the former opinion have in their fancy groven the ground, whereon
the sea beats, deeper and deeper toward the west, and so the ground being
situated higher in the East, shelving down gradually to the west, the sea does
through its natural gravity roll it self to the deeper and lower Plane; but
then the eastern waters being arrived to the west, how shall they return to the
east again for to continue the said motion? Wherefore this opinion may take its
place among the Castles in the air. Shall we then ascribe the cause of this
motion to the rarefaction of the sea through the beams of the Sun, which as it
is successively rarefied does swell and press its preceding parts forward? As
touching the Moon she cannot come into consideration here, as being rather
noted for condensation than rarefaction.

First, I deny that the Sun does any whit rarifie the Eastern Ocean; because
according to their Tenent the rarefaction of the sea happens through the
commotion of the subsidencies and terrestrial exhalations contained within the
bowels of the sea and scattered through its substance, whereby it becomes
tumefied, which I grant in case the Sun casts its beams obliquely into the
depth of the Ocean; but I prove the contrary, supposing the Sun does cast its
beams directly into the Eastern waters. In Egypt it seldom rains, because the
Sun casting its beams directly into the waters does through the same degree of
heat, through which it might raise vapors, dissolve them again, likewise in
the East Ocean the Sun subtilizing the waters does doubtless through its heat
commove exhalations and subsidencies, but the waters being through the same
heat attenuated are rendered incapable of sustaining those terrestrial bodies,
wherefore they sinking deeper to the ground rather cause a detumescence of the
sea. I have always observed that waters swell more through the cold than heat,
and that inundations happen for the most part after a frost; besides it is
obvious that Rivers are much tumefied when they are frozen, and that by reason
of the foresaid tumefaction inundations happen more frequently in the winter
than at any other time of the year. Descartes imagines the compression of the
Moon (together with the Earths motion about her own Axis) to be the cause of
the waters circular motion, pressing it from East to West, and the variation of
this pressure to depend upon the various removal of the Moon from the Center of
the Earth effecting the anticipation and various celerity of the waters motion:
So that where the Earth is obverted to the face of the Moon there the waters
must be at their lowest, being pressed toward the next quarter of the Surface,
where they are at their highest, whence they are carried about through the
Earths proper motion, etc.

1. I deny his supposition of the Earths motion, as being fabulous, which we
have confuted elsewhere. He might as well assert, that there be as many
Neptunes under water moving it circularly, as Aristotle stated intelligencies
to drive the Heavens, for even this he might excuse by saying it was but an
Assumption to prove a Phenomenon of the water.

2. What needs he to affirm a tumor of the water? for since he assumes the
Earth to move circularly, we cannot but grant that the water must also move
with it as constituting one Globe together.

5. Why does he in vain reassume in the 55 Sect. that out-worn Doctr. of
Aristotle touching the Moons driving of the water, which argues him to be very
unconstant with himself?

4. His stating the air to be so complicable and soft a body renders it very
unfit for compressing and driving so vast and weighty a body as the Ocean.

5. Can any one rationally or probably conceive, that the Sun, much less the
Moon, being so remore, and whose forcible effects are so little felt by
sublunary bodies, should be capable of driving so deep, so large, and so heavy
a body as the Ocean, which is as powerful to resist through its extreme
gravity, as all the Celestial bodies are potent to move through their extreme
lightness? What, because the Ocean and the Moon move one way, therefore the one
must either follow or move the other? What, can a passion so durable and
constant, and so equal depend upon a violent cause? Since then such phansies
are ridiculous, and not to be proposed by any Philosopher, let us now proceed
in the unfolding of so difficult and admirable a matter as the course of the
Ocean, which we have formerly demonstrated to flow about the earth once in 12
hours and somewhat more.

II. Moreover, besides this single motion making a sharper inspection into the
drift of the Ocean, it will appear to us to absolve a compounded periodical
course in a perfixt time, namely, in 15 days, which space may be called a
marinal or nautical month. The meaning hereof is, imagining a part of the Ocean
to flow circularly from a certain point, or more plainly, a Bowl to roll
circularly under water over the bottom of the Sea along with the course of the
Ocean, from any noted point, that the same part of the Ocean or Bowl shall in
the space of 15 natural days Or 30 single periods.
arrive to the same point, and exactly at the same time begin its next
periodical course thence, when it departed from that term the month before.
Nevertheless the Ocean does not omit its single course in fluctuating about the
Earth in somewhat more than twelve hours, but then it does not daily arrive to
the supposed point of a compounded periodical course at the same minute, when
the latter (viz. the compounded) begins its progress. Expressly, the great Ocean
through its diurnal course flows the length of 348 degrees about from East to
West, performing also the same circuit through its nocturnal course: That is,
every twelve AEquinoctial hours it absolves 348 degrees of the terrestrial
Equator: Wherefore for to flow 360 degrees it requires 24 24/2^ minutes of an
hour above the foresaid twelve hours: that is, the Ocean flows about the
terrestrial Equator in twelve hours, and 24 14/2^ minutes, absolving every
hour 29 degrees. Hence you may collect the cause of the retardation of the tide
every day.
How this swiftness is possible to the Ocean we shall make further declaration
of it anon. Besides a single diurnal, and a periodical compounded monthly
motion, another must also be added, which I call an augmentative motion,
through which the Ocean does gradually accrease every high water to some
certain cubits; of which more fully hereafter.

Since that time is nothing but a measure of motion, and that one time is made
known to us by another, it is thence occasioned that we come to know the time
of the Ocean by comparing it with the time of the Moon and of the Sun, as being
general marks whereby to calculate the seasons of the Ocean. This premised it
states a ground and reason of the measure of this great Sea, viz. That it is
usually high water in the Ocean under the AEquinoctial and Ecliptic, as also
upon the shores of the same at six in the morning and evening, when the Moon is
in opposition to, or conjunction with the Sun, and at the same hours about the
Moons quarters the waters there are at their lowest. On the other side, it is
as common among Mariners to measure the motion of the Sun and Moon by the Tides
or motions of the Seas, they being exquisitely skilled in discerning the hour
of the day and night, or the season of the several aspects of the Moon by the
said tides; Wherefore it may be thought as equal a consequence that the Moon in
her motion depends upon the course of the Ocean as pressing the air through her
tumefaction, which again does impel the Moon forward, as that the Moon should
tumefie the air, and thereby impel the waters forward: But I pass by this as
ridiculous.

Although the Ocean keeps so constant and exact a rule and measure in its
course, as likewise the Sun and Moon, yet we must not therefore conceive the
one to depend upon the other, because two great marks of their time (that is
one of either, viz. The greatest height of waters and the greatest aspect of
the Moon) are concurring in one day, that rather happening, because the Ocean
began its course at that instant, when the Moon after her creation being placed
in opposition to the Sun began hers. But possibly you will propose this
instance to evince that the highest water does depend upon the greatest
compression of the Moon, because when she is at her Full, she may cause some
compression and commotion of air and water, she then being in her greatest
strength, and situated in Perigaeo of her eccentrical Aspect, and therefore
nearest to the water, and so may add somewhat to the enhightning of its stream.
I answer, That it is a mistake to apprehend the Moon to be nearest at the Full,
most Astronomers asserting her rather to be remotest then, and to be nearest
when she is in her quarters: Ergo according to that rule the highest waters
should happen at the Moons quarters, and the lowest at the Full of the Moon: Or
otherwise, how can the Moon further the said motion, when she is upon the
extremity of her decrease, her rays drowned by those of the Sun, and she in
Apogaeo deferentis? Certainly, none can be so obtuse as to maintain her in that
capacity to have a power of compressing the air, when she being most remote the
air does most enjoy its freedom; yet nevertheless some are so obstinate to
assert, that the greatest altitude of the Sea because it happens then, does
likewise depend upon the compression of the Moon. What is more constant,
certain, periodical, and equal than the course of the Sea? Whereas the Moon is
vulgarly maintained to be subjected to anomalies; then in this part of the
Heavens, then in another; now in Apogaeo, perigaeo, concentrical, excentrical,
then swift, slow, etc. if so, then a constant and equal effect cannot consecute
the efficience of an unequal cause.

III. Against our discourse touching the diurnal course of the Ocean might be
objected, That it seems very improbable, that the Sea should move so swift, as
in a little more than 12 hours to overflow the whole terrestrial Globe; whereas
a ship through the advantage of her sails and a prosperous wind and weather,
being supposed to outrun the Tide, can scarce accomplish that course in a
Twelvemonth. Hereunto I reply, that the water takes the beginning of her motion
from underneath; for as I have formerly proved, that the formal cause of the
waters perennal motion is her gravity, which bearing down upon the Earth for to
gain the Center, is resisted by her, and nevertheless continuing in its motion
is necessarily shoven there Namely at the bottom underneath: ergo the waters
must also begin to move from underneath
to the side; and so the same happening to the succeeding parts are all impelled
through a natural principle of gravity sidewards, like unto an Arrow being shot
against a stone wall, and there resisted, is shoven down the side. Whence it
is apparent, that the waters take beginning of their motion underneath not far
from the ground, where being pressed by the great weight of many hundred
fathoms of water lying upon them, must needs cause a very swift course of
waters removing underneath and withdrawing from that of the Surface, which is
prevented of a swift motion, because it sinks down to that place whence the
subjected parts do withdraw themselves; which gives us a reason, why the
superficial parts of the Sea do not flow by many degrees so swift as the
subjected ones. Nevertheless some small motion is visible upon the Surface,
which may accelerate or retardate the course of a ship, but not comparable to
the waters in the deep. This instance will further certify you touching the
truth of the matter before said; a flat-bottomed Kettel filled up with water,
having a hole at the bottom near to the side of the said Kettel does emit the
water underneath spouting out with a very great swiftness through the hole,
whereas the water upon the Surface moves but very slowly toward the side near
the hole, because the water moving so swiftly underneath does cause that atop
to sink upon it which prevents its swift motion toward the side, and that
which causes the water underneath to spout so violently out of the hole is the
weight of the water atop pressing violently and forcibly downwards. This
occasions me to call to memory that apposite Phrase of the Dutch seamen, who
instead of saying the water ebbs, say Het water sacked, that is, the water
sinks, as if they would signify the water to move from underneath.

The Ocean then originally and primarily moving from underneath in a very swift
current, as the forementioned instance may easily confirm to us, has not that
extent to overrun there, which we might conceive it would have atop, but is
above the half shortened in its periphery through its depth, and consequently
through the deep excavation or extenuation of the Earth: Wherefore observe, 1.
That the Ocean underneath does well absolve so many degrees as we have writ
down before, but then they are much abbreviated and lessened in comparison to
those degrees, whereby the superficial circumference of the water is measured.

2. I say, that the Ocean absolves the foresaid course of 348 in 12 equal hours
only in its lower parts; But as touching its superficial ones it is certain
they are slow, absolving the same compass in no shorter time than six months,
which may be named a Marinal year. This slow progress is evidenced to us by the
slow drift of a piece of wood floating in the Ocean.

3. Although the superficial parts of the Ocean do not slow with so rapid a
course, yet it hinders not, but that they may tumefie as they do throughout
their whole circuit about the Earth in the space of 12 hours.

4. Since it must necessarily follow, that where the water tumefieth in one
place, it must sink in another, therefore the water tumefying once every 12
hours in the East 6 hours long, (in which space it arriveth to its height) it
must sink as much in the West, because that moisture, which causes the
intumescence in the East, does slow underneath from the West. By the same rule
the Eastern Ocean must also sink 6 hours in every 12 for to cause a tumefaction
in the West: Whence it is, that every 6 hours we perceive a change of the
Tide in the Ocean.

5. We are not to persuade our selves, that the Eastern flood is occasioned by
water returning from the West, and the western flood through the refluxe of
the same water from the East, because the Ocean does continually pass from east
to west by way of the South, not returning the same way through the South from
west to east, as appears by the quick Voyages of those, who setting sail with
a good wind and weather from Spain toward the West Indies do usually make land
in three or four weeks, whereas returning from thence can scarce recover Spain,
although having the wind very favorable, in less than three or four months.
Likewise a voyage from Moabar in the Indies to Madagascar, otherwise called St.
Laurences Island, may be accomplished in 20 days, but from Madagascar to Moabar
scarce in less time (although with a very prosperous wind) than three months:
In the same manner one may much sooner make a voyage from this Island to
Spain, lying hence more eastward, than from Spain back again hither, or in
sailing from Alicant (a City of Spain, situated upon the Mediterranean Coast)
toward Palestina, they usually make less speed than in returning. All which
are undoubted marks of the perennal course of the Ocean from East to west.
Wherefore Philosophers have been misled in imposing the names of Fluxus and
Refluxus upon the course of the Ocean as if returning the same way it went. I
have taken notice, that as the Dutch used a fit word for to denote the Ebb, so
the French have imposed another no less elegant upon the flood, viz. La Monte
de la Mare, or the rising of the Sea, exactly squaring with our foregoing
discourse: Thus when it is flood they usually say, Lamare il monte, that is,
the Sea rises. The Latinists call it AEstus Maris, or heat of the Sea, because
when the Sea begins to be filled with hot exhalations, it is wonted to be hot,
through which it swells, (like hot blood flushing into our faces and glowing
causes a puffing up and a rising) whence it is impelled to flow some part of
it one way, and another another way, which caused the flood, observed through
the rising of the waters upon the shores: These exhalations being dissipated,
the Sea beginning to cool withdraws it self again into its former compass, and
leaving the shores puts them in mind of the Ebb. But this dictate being proved
to be absurd does justly advise us to reject the forementioned name.

6. We need not to doubt being fully informed of this Doctrine, but that every
flood brings in new water, that of the last Ebb flowing forwards with the
course of the Sea toward the accomplishment of its annual period.

7. Let none be offended at us for granting an internal cause of the Seas
motion against Scalig. Exer. 52. asserting the Sea to be an Animal in case it
should be moved from an internal cause; were this a Paradox, we must then
believe that the Air, Fire, Heavens, and Stars are Animals, they all moving
through an intrinsic principle.

IV. My method does now lead me to demonstrate the several Phoenomena's of the
Ocean by their proper causes.

1. The Ocean flowing from East to West cannot be thought to be the sole cause
of the diurnal intumescence and detumescence of the Sea, since it may be
supposed to slow equally over an equal ground: Wherefore a second cause must
concur, to wit, an unequal ground, or an unequal grove, through which it
passes. The waters being through the second division of the Creation separated
from the Earth, which then lay in an equal round figure under the waters, these
consequently equally covering it in the same figure, were afterward through
the third division collected into one place, where they must have pressed their
great weighty body into two great universal groves viz. The east and west grove.
, whereupon the Earth must necessarily be pressed up into two great universal
eminences, which are divided from one another through the said waters, and
consequently constitute two great Islands, viz. of the New world or America,
and the Old world, or Asia, Africa, and Europa. The Sea after this working
through its great weight deeper and deeper into the Earth must necessarily
thereby have formed many other deep and great cavities within the sald
universal groves. The Earth, through whose recess or giving way, the said other
Cavities were impressed must needs have been compressed to some other part: not
toward the center, because the Earth was so very densely beset there, that it
was impossible it should give way: Ergo toward the Surface, where it was
molded and compressed up into all those great mountains, which we see every
where about the Sea-shores, and into all those great Banks and Rocks which
Seamen do meet withal every where; yea, some being stuffed up a great way
from the shore, as witness many Ships that have run aground in the Atlantic
Ocean above 60, 80, or 100 Leagues from the shore; likewise a great bank lying
off the Cape of St. Austin, and extended near 70 Leagues long. Lastly, A great
part of the receding earth was cast up into great and small Islands, especially
those numerous ones in the East and West Indies.

Let us then suppose those said small Isles, together with the great ones of
the East Indies to be accompanied with great and large banks or shelves,
whereof some are visible, others not; This supposition must needs force another
from us, viz. That the waters passing from West, by the North to the East, are
retarded and partly stopped by the said Isles, shelves or banks: In the mean time
during this retardation and partial stoppage, the waters flowing from East by
the South to West do decurre, decrease, and evacuate themselves unto the west
grove, until such a degree, that they are run off as low as possible, at which
time the other Namely the west grove.
is at its highest, and then they overflow the borders of the Eastern shelves,
and free themselves from the retention of the Isles, by which means the Eastern
grove begins to fill and increase, whose swift decurrence of waters being stopped
and retarded by the Western borders and banks fills up until high water. This
discourse may seem strange to you since the waters are never visibly stopped by
any shelves or banks, these always lying covered; but were it so that they
proved a stoppage, it must be imagined they should lie dry. Hereunto I answer.
That supposing the waters to move from underneath, they arriving at a deep
grove must needs be retarded through its shelving sides, as being against their
natural inclination to move upwards. This retardation of the water on the
bottom of the grove must necessarily cause the waters atop to swell and become
turgid or tumide, ever framing a round figure atop, which is a certain sign
denoting the grove to be of a parabolical figure. This tumefaction the Ancients
did abusively term an exestuation, as if proceeding from a fermentation within
the water. The water underneath being depressed on the bottom of the grove
according to its greatest capacity, and having withal elevated the waters atop
to their greatest height, does now begin to strive to clime up the shelves of
the grove, being thereunto moved through its own force continuated against the
Earth, but reflected by the same upwards, and propelled by the succeding parts
of the water, as also compressed and squeezed by the greatest weight of the
waters atop lying upon them, which compressing is much augmented by the great
force of the air and fire bearing against the water and earth for to gain the
Center: Whence the waters do now begin to flow over the banks of the said
shelves, making a tumefaction and gradually a high water wherever it comes, and
so evacuating it self out of one great grove into another happens to cause a
low and high water in the Ocean. Hence now you may easily collect the reasons
and causes of these several properties befalling the Ocean in its diurnal
course.

1. Every twelve hours there appears a rising of water in either of the
universal groves Take notice by the way, that by Grove I do not intend any
thing like to a Grove of trees, as the word is derived from growing; but a
cavern, as the same word is derived from Groven or to grave into the earth.
, viz. South and North grove continuating the space of 6 hours, because the
bottom of either grove is 6 hours in filling out of the one into the other.
Likewise every 12 hours the Ocean falls for 6 hours, because its water beneath
is so long in evacuating it self.

2. The beginning of the swelling of the Ocean is ever slow for two hours; much
quicker the next two; for one hour before the last is quickest of all: and the
last moves in an equal velocity with the latter of the two first; it is at its
slowest a little before the pinch of high water and at dead low water. The
beginning is slow, because that part, which causes the beginning of the
tumefaction of the water, is weakest as being most remote from the central
parts, and employing its greatest force in making way and mounting over the
shelves loses its strength, which it recovers when it is backed by the body or
central parts of the water following it, and so promoting its course with a
greater swiftness: And being with its whole body arrived to the bottom of the
grove it does as it were rest there for to recover its strength, which does
occasion its greatest slowness, the same consequently causing the greatest
diminution of motion at low water in the other grove.

3. High and low water of the Ocean is retarded every natural day near three
quarters of an hour, that is 34 ^4/2^ minutes of an hour in every single period
or 12 hours, because it accomplisheth but 348 degrees of the terrestrial
Equator in every 12 hours, which does want 12 degrees of its complete circuit,
and before it can absolve those 12 degrees through the beginning of a new
period, there passes 24 24/29 minutes of an hour, which gives us the true
reason of the Oceans retardation every day near three quarters of an hour. This
course lingering every natural day so many minutes, does in 30 periods or 15
days stay back full 360 degrees, being the total circumference of its circuit,
and so, as it were, absolves a compounded period through its retardation in 15
days, which space agreeing with the time of the Moons middle motion between
her conjunction and opposition, no wonder, if the Ocean also agrees to be at
its height at a prefixed and constant time, always being one and the same, when
the Moon her aspect is New or Full.

4. The Ocean happens to be augmented or elevated higher than ordinary every
Full or New Moon, because every thirtieth or middle period, (which ever falls
accidentally, but not as if only depending upon the Moon, as upon her New or
Full Aspect) it has acquired its greatest force of flowing, whereby it drives
before it and carries along with it a greater confluence of water than at any
other season. This intension of course it procures gradually more and more
every period, until at last it comes to its highest, after which in like
manner it decreases again, until it is descended to its least remission, which
is upon every thirtieth circuit coincident for the most part with the Moons
quarters; that is, the Ocean at its high water is in comparison to the high
waters of the other precedent or following courses at the lowest, when the Moon
appears in her quarters, because the force of the Oceans course is then most
remitted. Here we may observe the beginning of this intending or periodical
compounded course to be, when the Ocean moves with the least force, causing the
lowest high water, and the highest low water, which frequently happens near to
the Moons quarters, whose middle is marked by the Moons Full and New Aspect,
being when it flows with the greatest force causing the highest high waters,
and the lowest low waters, and tends toward its ending, when it remits from
its height and intends in lowness. This augmentation and diminution may be
resembled to the fermentation of Wine or Beer, swelling gradually until its
height, and thence decreasing again. Touching the beginning and ending of the
Seas single diurnal circuit, if we consider it simpliciter, it has none,
because it is ever in motion, as never being eased by a total rest; but if
agreeing to state the beginning, where the Ocean is slowest in its course, and
thence tending to a swifter motion, then the Proposition is resolveable: And
according to this Supposition, the beginning and ending must be moveable,
differing every single course near 11 degrees; This by the way: Returning to
explain the cause of the gradual augmentation of water, and intention of force,
I am to remember you of the great proportion of the Oceans peregrin Elements
consisting of most Earth, then Air, and lastly fire, of whose close coherence
with the waters, their saltness is an undoubted argument: These salin particles
violently detaining the waters from recovering the center, must necessarily add
force to the gravity of the waters, and consequently in intending their force
they must also augment them in quantity, because the more force the waters use,
the more in quantity they bear along with them. The detention of the said salin
particles being at their beginning of no great strength, or in no great
quantity, do therefore cause no great intention of the Oceans force, but every
single period piercing gradually by rarefaction upon the waters, must
necessarily also augment their tumefaction gradually higher and higher every
day, until at last being arrived to their height of penetration, which
ordinarily happens in 15 circuits, the Ocean is likewise elevated unto its
height. Some of these salin particles, being penetrated through the body of the
waters, are gradually depressed to the ground through their own disposition,
and the weight of the Ocean, others being attrited and confused through their
passive motion against the water, and the decess of their heaviest particles do
more and more gradually desist from their violent detention, every circuit,
returning to the bottom, and so the Ocean does also gradually every day incline
nearer and nearer to its natural force and detumescence of its water, until it
is returned to its own proper course, at which season its force and
intumescence are equally at their lowest. During this space those subsiding
particles begin again to be expanded, rarefied and attenuated, because of the
grinding of the water against them, and through the expansion of the aerial and
igneous parts adunited to them do bear up again: The others elevated atop
beginning to concentrate through the conquiescence of the Sea, are ready to be
compressed downwards both which gradually striving a reciprocal meeting do in
the foregoing manner gradually reunite the force and augmentation of the Water.

V. Here we cannot but admit the Suns intense hear, every day beating down the
torrid Zone, to be a great instrumental and adjuvant cause to the stirring of
the aforesaid salin particles: But this continuing in one measure, equality,
and station in respect to the torrid Zone all the year long cannot in any wise
be thought the principal cause of a motion varying twice every day.

Likewise the Moon being beset with a great quantity of dampish and heavy
particles, does every day spread down some of those particles, whereby the
Ocean is also gradually filled more and more every day: And like as these said
particles are most apt to rain down, the nearer the Moon does appropinquate to
the Ecliptic, because the air enjoys a greater subtility there from the
rarefaction of the Sun; hence it is, that the Moon frees her self most of these
heavy concomitants near her Conjunction and at her apposition: So they are most
apt to ascend the further the Moon is declined from the Ecliptic, as happens
in her quarters, when for that reason the waters are also at their lowest. That
these two Lights are accidental causes of the intention of the Oceans force and
daily augmentation of its waters is plain enough, and their mutual concurrence
to the effecting of the same effect we have confirmed beyond all doubting,
whereby the absurdity of the Moons compression proposed by Descartes, and so
disagreeing with his own position of the nature of the air, is likewise set
before you.

The Moon near her Conjunction makes very high waters, because conversing with
the hot rays of the Sun sends down a great number of the foresaid bodies, and
not because she is impregnated with the light of the Sun, whereby she should be
grown more potent to excite vapors and exhalations: This is ridiculous, for we
find other bodies to be swelled near that time not only through exhalations
raised out of themselves, but particularly through particles demitted by the
conveyance of the air into their pores. The like happens, although in a weaker
manner, when the Moon is in her full Aspect, because of her nearer
approximation to the Ecliptic: But much more in a Lunar Eclipse, because she
is then found directly in the Ecliptic. And most of all, yea twice higher than
ordinary at the Full Moon of March and September, because the Sun being then in
the AEquinoxial, and most directly over the torrid Zone, under which the
greatest body of the Ocean floats, and the Moon in the same way near the
Ecliptic, must needs jointly cause a vast decidence of the forenamed bodies
intending and augmenting the waters.

Or to declare the matter plainer to you: The continuation of the Seas Motion
forward is not only depending upon the pulsion of succeeding parts bending by
refraction naturally forward, but also by a kind of attraction or suction of
preceding parts, thus: Suppose the Earth to be excavated into certain great
cavities, like to great pipes, whereof of those that are formed from the East
toward the West by the South the furthermost are always deeper and longer
than those, which are nearest to the East; Likewise conceive such Cavities
framed in the same proportion to one another from West back again to the East
by the North; Now I say, that the deepest and furthermost cavity must always
attract the water out of the shallower and lesser, in the same manner, as the
longer pipe of a sucker (a Siphon as some do call it) must attract all the
moisture of the shorter, because the parts of water being continuous, and
consequently cleaving to one another, the lesser part must follow and yield to
the greater, the which through its crastitude being pressed forwards must also
draw the lesser part after: Since then the water is no sooner arrived into one
cavity but is thence drawn into another, hence it is that this tumefaction of
waters is not sensible to us in the Ocean. The number of these cavities we must
suppose to be fifteen on each half of the terrestrial Globe; because the Sea
does in every periodical compounded course make thirty stations, or so many
tumefactions, by which it must needs work it self into so many cavities. This
supposed, it does infer another assumption, viz. That since the Ocean moves
over so many borders or shelves of cavities, it must necessarily move in Bores:
A Bore (or more properly a Bare) is a tumefaction of water underneath moving
very swift, and elevating the waters atop into a tumefaction proportionable to
it underneath: An example of Bores you have in the River of Seyne, and many
other Rivers, where great shallows obstruct the flood of the waters underneath:
But of this more hereafter. The Ocean then moving in a great bore must raise a
tumefaction, wherever it passes: This tumefaction being originally in the
middle parts causes the flood by sending a proportion of waters (falling
through their gravity from the top to the sides as being lower situated) to the
coasts on both sides which it passes. Hence we may collect that where ever the
borders of the foresaid cavities do respect the Coasts, there the Inhabitants
must have a swise appulse of the flood. The Ebb is nothing else but the waters
returning from the sides to the middle parts, being left lower through the
recess of the Oceans bore or tumefaction: but this by the way.

It is most certain, that the Western Ocean directs its waves toward the East;
but whence this continual course of water is supplied may justly be doubted,
and although the Eastern Ocean does constantly flow toward the West, yet how
and where Mar del Nort meets with Mar del Zur remains to be made to appear.
Their visible communication through the straits of Magallan, or of Le maire, or
the straites of Martin Forbisher, and of Anjan, cannot be imagined to conduce
any thing considerable toward the presupposed evacuation; that of Magallan
little exceeding a League in breadth, or above 10 or 12 fathom in depth,
besides the many turnings and windings and length of near 110 or 120 Leagues
hindering any considerable course of water: The others not much surpassing
these either in breadth or depth seem to conduce as little. But to make the
course clear beyond all dispute the West-Indian Earth is boared through deep
underneath by the former compression of the Ocean, through which immense
perforation the great bore of the Sea enjoys a free passage, and rowles along
under the Peruvian Ocean. By means of this vast perforation the Indian Earth is
much elevated, and in most places has acquired the full height, which it
obtains being clome up atop the Sea by many Leagues, whence it is that the
Land by far overlooking the Ocean does appear to Mariners three or fourscore
Leagues off at Sea.

I. HItherto we have followed the main course of the Ocean Westward: In the
next place let us cast an eye toward the Northern coasts, where we shall meet
the Sea rolling contrarily, now from the South to the North, then from the
North back again toward the South. This contrariety must not persuade us,
although authorized with Scaligers subtility, that the Sea is an Animal,
neither need we to lay hold upon that notion of the Libration of the universal
waters for to salve this doubt: However I will not think it much to tell you
the meaning of it. The Libration of the Ocean is the projection of its parts
from the Center to the Circumference through a diurnal fermentation raised by
the torrid rays of the Sun, or according to Libavius his droling, through a
diurnal-egurgitation of water out of a bottomless pit of the Ocean (called its
navil) and projected toward its extreme parts. As this kind of spouting should
be the cause of the flood, so its returning back into the Earths tun belly, or
the cessation of the foresaid fermentation should be the cause of the Oceans
reflux from the said parts, be they Northern or Southern, etc. The exposition
it self of this subject will evert its supposed reality, for if such a
fermentation were granted, the Ocean must at one and the same time move to all
the points of the Compass, and at the same time return from the same points to
the Center; But what expert Mariner is there that will not testify otherwise?
And where is this Center? Possibly in the torrid Zone between Madagascar and
Los Romeros, where a very strong tide is generally observed, but not moving
Eastward and Westward at one time; if so no Ship could pass without yielding
her self to the bottom. Neither can Libavius his fancy be admitted, because
such a Gurges spouting out would cast Ships from it at one time into all parts
with an unimaginable force, and likewise would attract Ships from those parts
back again with no less force and swallow them down into her belly. That these
properties would necessarily accompany such a vast Whirl-Pool is proved by that
dangerous Whirl-Pool in the North sea near the coasts of Norway, by Mariners
called the Navil of the world, through its egurgitation casting Ships to a
great distance from it, and through its ingurgitation drawing them from the
same distance into her throat. These Hypotheses insisting upon no spark of
appearance, we are forced to make choice of our precedent one, whereby to
demonstrate the different flowing and ebbing of these narrow Seas toward and
from the Septentrional Polar. There be few but knows, that the Narrow Seas
undergo a gradual tumefaction and a rolling up of their waters, being withal
very swift, and arriving successively from one coast to another; as also a
successive detumescence and decurrence of the said waters. Now the reason why
these waters do not accompany the Ocean from the East toward the West, is
their shallowness and enclosure between narrow borders: For the bore of the
Ocean coming rolling down the Ethiopian Ocean toward Mar del Nort is
discontinued (as it were) in its depth through the shallow bottom of the polar
Seas, and therefore does only give them a cast or throw in passing: For the
bore arriving and swelling gradually does through that gradual swelling squeeze
the shallow polar seas toward the Poles in passing by notwithstanding
continuing its course Westward: The bore being passed the Ocean begins to
wax detumescent, whereby the shallow waters being deserted of the squeezing
Ocean do return into the Ocean. The universal intumescence passing twice every
natural day does cause a double change of the polar Tides in the same time.
That swiftness, which befalls our Tides in these parts, is likewise caused
through the shallowness of waters, which are necessarily impelled swifter
forward, than if they being imagined to be deep, where consequently waters
being in a great confluence more weighty must move slower. Hence we may learn
the reason, why the tide in some places does move swifter than in others,
namely, because the Sea is more shallow there, and therefore Ships arriving
near the shore make a greater benefit of the Tide, than far from it. The Flood
is commonly weaker and slower, near the shores, and within the compass of these
narrow Seas; but the Ebb is stronger and swifter, because the waters do clime
upwards being forced against their natural impulse, and therefore resist more
potently, but returning do descend fortified with their own natural inclination
into places detumefied, and therefore meeting with no resistance. On the
contrary, in the middle of the Ocean the flood or rather intumescence is
stronger and swifter than the ebb or detumescence, because the universal bore,
which is the cause of the flood or intumescence of the water does cause a
greater impulse of the water atop through her presence than when she is quite
passed; Hence it is that Ships sailing from East India Westward do over run a
larger tract in one six hours of the intumescence, than the other six of
detumescence. Those Seas, which are derived directly northerly from the Ocean
do suffer a greater commotion of tides than others, than are indirectly thence
descending. Hence it is, that the Irish Seas being directly opposite from the
North to the Ocean do undergo more violent Tides than others, because they
receive the squeezing or impulse of the Ocean directly upon them, whereas in
the Channel, North sea, and the Bay of Biscay, the waters do perform their
Tides more moderately, because they floating under the North, the Oceans
universal impulse is much mitigated by the defense of the Promontories of
France, England, and Spain. That, which does further augment the violence of
Tides in the Irish Seas is the shallowness of the water, and the meeting of
Tides, viz. First they receive the impulse of the Ocean directly from the
Southwest, passing between the West of England and the East of Ireland toward
the North; then the same Ocean continuing its impulse against the west Coasts
of Ireland, the Sea sets about the Northwest Cape of Ireland, toward the West
of Scotland, and the stronger, because it is refracted, and, as it were,
somewhat pinched by the shallowness of the Hebrides and other Islands; Through
this thwart setting off of the Tide it meets with the Tide passing through
between England and Ireland, which it beats back, and that more forcibly
toward the latter end of the Flood. The Tides then meeting here and reflecting
must necessarily cause very rough Seas; besides this, the German Seas seem to
set off somewhat toward the Northwest of Scotland, where meeting with the
Irish Sea do much intend the aforesaid roughness. This also causes the
duplication of Tides in several parts of the Irish Seas. It will not be
unprofitable to observe the streams of the Tides, where Seamen do state a
general rule, viz. That the Tide sets off athwart, wherever it beats against a
great Promontory: Hence it is, that throughout the Channel the Tide sets off
athwart in many places from the French Coast toward the English, where the
Land sticks out in great nooks: As from the great Promontory of France in the
mouth of the Channel, and from that which is opposite to the Isle of Wight, and
from before Calis, etc.

II. The Promontories do very much weaken the Tides, and clip them off from
waters streaming in the No theast; whence it is, that there is no Tide in the
East or Baltic Seas; besides:

1. Because the Tide of the German Sea is clipped off by the peninsule of Denmark
or Jutland and the narrowness of the Sound.

2. The course of the German Sea is the easier kept off, because it floats to
the Northward, whereas the Baltic Sea opens into it from the East. Hence it is
also, that a great part of these Seas consists of fresh waters, because the
North Sea is not disburdened into it.

Touching the first production of this Sea, (to wit the East Sea) it is very
probable that it derived its rice from a great Lake, risen in the deepest and
broadest place of the said Sea, which by continuance of pressure has bored
through that large tract which now is: That this is so I prove.

1. Had the German Ocean b^red this Cavern, then a greater part of it would
have been salt, and heavy like unto the same.

2. It would then have been more deep than it is, and have had a greater
opening; wherefore it must needs have had its beginning from a Lake, and for
that reason is very improperly called a Sea, more justly deserving the name of
a Sinus or Gulf.

III. In many places the Sea is taken notice to rise to the height of a Pike,
as before the River of Seyne, whose rising they vulgarly call the Bare, or
bore, taking its beginning with the advent of the Flood, and afterward
overflovving a great length of that River as far as Roan in a great height, but
gradually diminishing. The cause of this is to be attributed to the depth of a
Cavern encompassed by shelves and banks, wherein the Sea is collected and
stayed until such time that it does gather it self into a bare, whereby it
lifts it self up and climbs up the banks, and being attended with the same
force, whereby it did elevate it self, is protracted as far as Roan. Here again
we have an evident testimony of the Seas moving underneath, confirming what I
have proposed touching the universal Bore. If the waters here took their
beginning of motion from their superficial parts, then a bare were impossible
to arise here, because the waters are free and in no wise stopped in their motion
atop; Ergo being stopped underneath it is undoubted, that the waters take their
beginning of motion thence. The same bares you have here and there in the Seas,
which occasion the oversetting of many a Ship, or the casting of them upon
rocks and shelves, which they could not escape, because of the violence of the
same bores. This bare is seldom visibly perceived in the Seas, because it seems
to be drowned by the waves, nevertheless in many places it is. The cause of the
breaking of the Sea upon banks you may easily know out of the precedents.

IV. The Mediterranean Sea undergoeth an intumescence and detumescence,
although not very strong or swift; the reason of the latter is, because it
being situated Easterly escapes the strength of the course of the Ocean flowing
westwards: Only, the Ocean through its continual passing by does continually
impell the waters of the straits of Gibraltar or the Pillars of Hercules
inwards. This impulse of the waters inwards is much stronger at the
intumescence of the Ocean, but weak at the detumescence, nevertheless the
current of the Sea runs constantly inwards, because of the constant diurnal
course of the Ocean from East to West; so that this constant current into the
Pillars of Hercules is an Herculean argument, confirming the constant diurnal
motion of the Ocean. That, which causes the flood or intumescence here, is the
Ocean impelling the Sea strongly underneath at its intumescence: The cause of
the detumescence is the water falling from underneath the Mediterranean into
the universal Cavern, because of the detumescence of the Ocean. Moreover,
observe the property of the ebbing and flowing of this Sea: Through the
intumescence the water is impelled Eastward, as well near the shores as in the
middle: Through the detumescence or waters falling from underneath the waters
of the shores do fall toward the central or middle parts of that Sea, yet
somewhat westward, because the Sea does fall from underneath westward; and
notwithstanding the detumescence does the middle of the Mediterranean float
constantly inwards, although but weakly, because of the aforesaid impulse.

Hence it appears that the Mediterranean is an exact emblem of all the motions
befalling the Ocean. Touching its original it is certain, that the Ocean did
not form its Cavern through its constant motion; because were it so, that Sea
would be largest at its mouth, as having withstood the first violence of the
Ocean.

2. Because it is situated out of the reach of the course of the Ocean floating
always westward.

3. Where this Sea communicates with the Ocean, it seems rather to be its
ending than the mouth of its narrowness, and it is very probable that near the
creation the extremity of Spain and the Kingdom of Fez joined in an Istmus,
which since through violence of the Ocean and the pressure of the Mediterranean
is bored through. The rice then of this Sea must be adscribed to the peregrin
Element of water breaking out of the Earth through the concussion of the third
Division, which afterward was contained within a great rent or Sinus of the
Earth: Neither did the Euxian Sea derive its original from the Mediterranean,
because of the narrowness of the Channel, through which they have access to
each other: But this with most great Lakes of the World, as the Maotis,
Haneygaban, etc. were formed through accidental protrusions of the peregrin
Element of water, as you shall read in the next Chapter.

Among the various courses of the Sea we must not forget the inserting the
causes of currents, whose waters although communicating with the Ocean, do
notwithstanding make choice of a distinct motion, varying withal at certain
seasons: Thus Mariners observe a strong current from Cabo Delgado toward the
Cape of Good Hope streaming Southwest: and another floating westward from Cabo
das correntes to the River Aguada of Boapaz. Near Aguada de San Bras the
current runs toward the Land. The cause is the different position and degree
of depth of their Cavity, which varying from that of the Ocean do suffer their
waters to be squeezed to a different course: Neither must any imagine that the
wind is the principal cause of these currents, and much less of the universal
Tides of the Ocean, because the stronger the wind blows against them, the
stronger they float against the wind.

CHAP. IX. Of Inundations.
1. Of the rice of the great Gulphs of the Ocean. The causes of Inundations.
That the Deluge mentioned in Genesis was not universal. The explanation of the
Text. 2. The manner of the Deluge. That it was not occasioned through the
overfilling of the Ocean. 3. That there happened very great Deluges since; when
and where. 4. The effects of the first Deluge. 5. Inland Inundations.


1. THe Ocean and others of its Arms, through their continual violence against
the Earth do in time bore great Caverns into her body, whence the great Gulphs
of Bengala, Persia, Arabia, Mexico, most great Bays and straits took their
beginning, and no wonder since they were molded by the strong stream of the
Ocean floating westward. Neither is the Ocean satisfied of the Earth for
possessing the Center (for which they have both an equal claim) in making such
assaults upon her, but is still striving to enter and begin new irruptions into
her, whereby it often grows victorious of some of her Plains, as appears by those
frequent inundations sustained in England, (particularly, that of
Somersetshire, extending to 20 miles in length, and 15 in breadth, whose fury
had drowned several Towns, and swallowed up many hundreds of men, some making
their escape upon deals and pieces of Timber of Houses, that were washed away;
Rabbets fled their lodges and got atop Sheeps backs swimming as long as they
could for their lives: Corn and straw floated up and down in abundance, being
filled with Rats and Mice endeavoring their escape, besides a great number of
dead creatures that were seen adrift) Holland, many places of Asia, Africa,
etc. Among these none was ever more furious, than the Deluge happening in the
year of the Creation 1656, mentioned in the seventh Chapter of Genesis, whose
eminence above the Earth reached to 15 Cubits, destroying all living Creatures
(except some few only) that had thitherto fed upon the fruits of the ground. I
must not forget here to rectify Peoples judgments persuading themselves that
this Inundation should have been universal. I grant it was universal in two
respects:

1. To all the Earth that was inhabited by the Patriarchs and their Tribes.

2. In respect to the universal damage and loss; for it had destroyed all that
was upon Earth, excepting those that were miraculously preserved for the
preservation and use of the race of Man. But pray can any one rationally
conceive, that the height of 15 Cubits of water above those hills of Asia
should have exceeded the tops of all the mountains of the world? What
proportion is there between those hills and 15 Cubits, and the Peak of
Taeneriffe, the Mount Venpi in Queticheu, or Jekin in Chingutu, or Kesing,
Mung, Hocang, Juntay, Loyang, Kiming, (where they are nine days in getting up
to the top) Funghoan, being all Mountains of China reaching higher than the
lower clouds; The Olympas, Athos, or those high Mountains upon the West-Indian
Coasts? No more than there is between a man and a steeple. Or is it probable
that forty days rain should drown the whole World, when a whole six months
rain falling every Winter upon the East Indies scarce increases the
intumescence of the Ocean. But observe the scope of the Scripture, Genesis 7. 18.
And the waters prevailed greatly, and were greatly increased upon the earth,
etc. Here the divine Text seems to intend nothing further than a great
prevailing and increase of the waters, which could effect little more than a
partial Inundation; for otherwise to have caused an universal one, none less
than the greatest prevailing and increase of waters would have sufficed.
Wherefore the words of ver. 19. viz. And all the Hills, that were under the
whole heaven, were covered, are to be understood only of all the hills, that
were covered by the whole heaven described by their Horizon: And still in the
popular speech, when we say the whole heaven, we mean no more than the Horizon,
that is as far as we can see round about us.

II. Next let us consider the manner of this great Deluge.

1. It was not caused through the irruption of the Ocean into the earth,
because then the said Deluge would have been extremely sudden, viz. in six
hours time the flood must have brought in the waters, and it must have left a
large Gulf, where it brake in: Neither was the Sea high enough to have made
such an assault.

2. The beginning of it was taken as the Text holds forth, v. 11, 12. From the
breaking up of the fountains of the great deep, and the opening of the windows
of heaven, and the violent rain: These sudden impetuous tempests must needs
have caused a great astonishment and anguish upon those who had so justly
deserved. The breaking up of the Fountains were the bursting of the peregrin
Elements, contained within the bowels of the earth, especially of water, air
and fire out of the great deep, that is the vast Mediterranean Sea, by men of
that Age called and accounted the great deep.

The great occasion of this bursting out of the waters were 1. The heavy innixe
of earth in the shallows of the Mediterranean pressing the waters underneath
from its Center.

2. The air and fire forced through the earth of the said shallows to pass to
their own Element.

3. The tearing winds sent down through the opening of the windows of heaven,
which piercing the pores of the earth contributed not a little to the stirring
up of the air and fire contained within the earth, and to the vibration of the
terrestrial Mass.

4. The impetuous showers of rain breaking down and dividing the earth.

Through this tempest the waters of the Mediterranean got above the earth, and
a great proportion of the tract of air brake into the earth, having so fair an
opportunity as at the nick of bursting to get nearer to the Center: But being
enclosed by water and separated from its Element was by the potent compression
of the said water forced to return, whereby the waters must necessarily be much
tumefied, listed up, and cast out of their mole, whence they were constrained
to float over the earth: but the air being most returned, the rain restrained,
and the winds directed to pass over the earth, the waters settled and retired
into their Cavern leaving the earth very much disposed to germination of
plants; and so the stopping up of the Fountains of the deep and the windows of
heaven was accomplished.

III. Not many years after there happened another deluge somewhat less than the
former, caused through the bursting up of those waters, that now constitute the
Mare majus or Euxiun Sea, and the Lake Maeotis. Some hundred years after
another deluge came upon Persia and Tartary by the bursting up of the Hircanian
or Caspian Sea. The West-Indians have successively retained in their memory a
great Inundation, which they imagine was universal, came upon them through the
bursting up of the Lake Haneygaban, or Perime in Guiana.

Through these beforementioned deluges a great part of the Island Cea, half of
the Town Tyndarida in Sicily, Acarnania (being drowned in the Gulf of
Ambracia) and Achaia in the Gulf of Corinsh, and other great Countries must
have been swallowed up and laid even with the bottom of the said waters; as
likewise happened to Pyrrha, Antissa, Elice, Bura, and many other places: others
must have appeared through the thrusting up of that Land, in whose stead the
waters succeeded. This occasioned the new appearances of Delos and Rhodus, of
Nea situated between Lemnus and the Hollespont; of Abone, Thera, Therasia,
Hiera, and Anaphe.

IV. Through the said discontinued and unequal bursting up of the waters and
breaking of the land, Sicily was separated from Italy, Cyprus from Syria, Besby
from Bithynia, Atlas and Macria from Euboea, Euboea from Boeotia, Leucosta from
the Sirenian Promontory, and many other Islands comprehended within the
Mediterranean from the Continent: Likewise have many Sea port Towns in Europe
been separated from the Continent, as witness many Ships that have run a ground
upon their steeples and houses: Thus in the year 1421 many Towns and Villages
of Holland and Freezland were swallovved up by the Sea; and the Seamen to this
day are forced to take notice where such and such of their Towns were
drowned, for fear of inhabiting them again.

The waters through their pressing weight do sometimes decline from one
place, which they then leave dry, to another, where they have molded a
deeper Cavern; by such an occasion were the Islands of Antissa left dry, and
so united to the Continent of Lesbos, Zephyrius to Halicarnassus, Ethuso to
Mindus, Dromiscon and Peers to Miletus, Narthecusa to the Parthenian
Promontory; Hybanda, Epidaurus, Magnesia, and Oricon to the Continent: The same
has arrived to many other places; namely that some part of a shore has been
deserted through the Seas declination, (as happened to the Country about
Ambracia, Ephesus, the Plain of Arabia, and above Memphis as far as the
Ethiopian Mountains, having been all over covered by the Sea) in such a
manner, that Ships which had been cast away upon the sands near to that shore
were after some hundreds of years found some miles off from the Sea, deeply
covered with earth by length of time, cast upon them partly from the adjacent
hills by the vvind; and partly by the heaving up of the sand through the seas
diurnal Tides. Hence we may easily know, whence that Mast came, that was
found with a Pulley to it sticking out of the top of one of the steep hills of
Spitsberg in Greenland near where they usually fish for Whales.

Before I go further I must convince those of their mistake, that state
Earthquakes the occasion of the disappearance of some Islands, and appearance
of others, formed through the violent and unequal bursting up of earth.

1. Let them take notice that Earthquakes are fresh enough in men's memories in
the West Indies, and those great ones too, yet they never, or very seldom have
protruded any Islands there; neither is their eruption large enough for to
compass such an effect.

2. Earthquakes happen most through the Earths belching up of wind, that happened
to be enclosed within her belly, but it is impossible that a wind should drown
a Country, or raise an Island: Possibly you may reply, That together with a
wind there often bursteth out a flood of water. I grant it, and what is this else
but a Deluge? Thus many Towns and Villages in Holland and Friesland have been
formerly swallowed up by such deluges, as their great Lakes are still
testimonies of; and to my apprehension all that Country must necessarily be
subjected to such deluges, since it swims upon the water.

Touching Inland Inundations, as that which befell Friesland in the year 1218,
where near 100000 persons were buried in the water; and that of Holland and
Zealand in the Reign of Charles the fifth Emperor of Germany, in the year
1531. and several times since, as that of the last year, when a great part of
the Country all about Gorcum was seized upon by Inland waters. Their causes are
to be attributed to torrents streaming down out of the melted snow, as also to
the swelling of the Inland waters, through receiving a great quantity of frosty
minima's, pouring down from the North in a cold Winter.

The River of Nile proves yearly extravagant in Egypt for two months and ten
days, because being situated very low it is obliged to receive the superfluity
of water falling from above out of several great Rivers and Lakes, as the
Lakes Zembre, Saslan, Nuba, and the Rivers Cabella, Tagazi, Ancona, Coror, and
many others, besides the water which it draws from the hills and other
grounds. These Rivers and Lakes do constantly swell every year by reason of the
great rains, that fall there at certain times of the year. Besides the heat of
the Sun exercising its power very vigorously near the latter end of May, does
very much subtilize and rarefie those waters, whereby they are rendered more
fluid, penetrating and copious; and lastly the Sun conversing in the northern
declination does impell the Ocean stronger against the Northern shores, whereby
the waters are also much increased. Hence it is, that the waters of the Nile
are so subtle, that they deceive the air in carrying of them up in vapors,
viz. because they are so subtly strained: No wonder then if they prove so
healthy. The same causes are appli^ble to the excessive increase of the Rivers
Ganges, Padus, Arrius, Danow, Tiber and Athesis.

CHAP. X. Of the causes of the beforementioned properties of Lakes.
1. Whence the Lake Asphaltites is so strong for sustaining of weighty bodies,
and why it breeds no Fish. The cause of qualities contrary to these in other
Lakes. The cause of the effects of the Lake Lerna. 2. Whence the virtues of the
Lake Eaug, of Thrace, Gerasa, the Lake among the Troglodites, Clitorius,
Laumond, Vadimon, and Benaco are derived. 3. Whence the properties of the Lake
Larius, Pilats Pool, and the Lake of Laubach emanate.


I. What the cause of those effects of the Lake Asphaltites should be, the
name seems to contain, viz. The water glued together by an incrassated air and
condensed fire, constituting the body of a certain Bitumen, called Asphaltos,
whence the said Lake does also derive its name: It is incapable of breeding
fish, because through its sulphurous thickness it suffocates all vital
flames. On the contrary the Lakes Avernum (although deep 360 fathom) and that
of AEthiopia are so much subtilized through the passing of rarefied air, that
they are incapable of sustaining the least weight. Touching their pernicious
quality to fowl, it must be attributed to the venomous spirits permixt with
that rarefied air, infecting the whole Element of air as far as it covers them.
The Lake Lorna and the other in Portugal cause their effects through the
permixture of a quantity of crude nitrous bodies, which prove very depressing.
That Lake of AEthiopia is unctious through the admixture of incrassated air.

II. The Lake Eaug in Ireland acquires a sideropoetick virtue under water from
the imbibition of crude Aluminous juyces, by means of their indurating and
constrictive virtue changing wood sticking in the mud into an Iron-like
substance; that part which is under water into a stone-like substance, because
of the diminution of the said Aluminous Juyces, which through their weight are
more copious in the mud; the part of the wood that sticks out of the water
remains wood, as being beyond the reach of the said heavy juyces. The Lakes of
Thrace and Gerasa prove pernicious through admixture of crude arsenical
exhalations. The Lake among the Troglodites being Mercurial is infestuous to
the brain. The Lake Clitorius through its nitrosity disturbs the stomach, and
attracts a great quantity of moisture to it, and infecting it with an offensive
quality, causes a loathing of all Liquors. The sudden tempests befalling the
Lake Laumond and Vadimon are caused through winds breaking out of the earth
through the water. Lakes resist induration by frost through igneous expirations
pervading them. The Lake Benacus shows its fury, when its internal winds are
excited by external ones, causing a Concussion and a Rage in the water, like
unto an aguish body, which is disposed to a shaking fit by every sharp wind
raising the sharp winds within.

III. The River Abda passes freely through the Lake Larius without any
commotion of its body, because the waters of the Lake through their extreme
crassitude are depressed downwards, and so are constituted atop in a rigid
posture, whereas the River is impelled forwards, and very little downwards: But
were it to flow through a shallow water, whose quantity does not bear any
proportion to receive the pressure of the air downwards against the earth, they
would soon communicate in streams.

2. The waters of a Lake differ much in crassitude and density from those of a
River, and therefore do exclude its streams.

The Lake Haneygaban does not visibly disburden it self of those waters, but
thrusting Caverns underneath into the earth, raises all those hills through the
intumescence of the said waters, that are near to her, out of which some Rivers
do take their rice.

Pilats Pool is stirred into a vehement fermentation by flinging any pressing
body into it; because thereby those heterogeneous mineral juyces (viz.
Vitriolat and Sulphurous substances) are raised, mixed together, and brought to
a fermentation and working: Through this fermentation the water swells and
exceeds its borders; but the water being clarified the commotion cease.
Neither needs any one wonder, that so small a matter should be the cause of so
great an exestuation, since one part of the water does stir up the other, and
so successively the whole pool comes to be stirred.

Pools owe their rice to great rains or torrents, which sometime do slow
visibly over the meadows, or through Rivers causing inundations: Sometimes
through Caverns of the Earth, as that near Laubach.

CHAP. XI. Of the rice of Fountains, Rivers and Hills.
1. That Fountains are not supplied by rain. 2. Aristotle's opinion touching the
rice of Fountains examined. 3. The Authors assertion concerning the rice of
Fountains. The rice of many principal Fountains of the world. 4. Why Holland is
not mountainous. 5. That the first deluge was not the cause of Hills. 6. Whence
that great quantity of water contained within the bowels of the Earth is
derived. 7. Whence it is that most shores are Mountainous. Why the Island Ferro
is not irrigated with any Rivers. Why the earth is depressed under the torrid
Zone, and elevated toward the polars. The cause of the multitude of Hills in
some Countries and scarcity in others. 8. How it is possible for the Sea to
penetrate into the bowels of the earth.


I. THe opinion of Fountains, scattering out of the earth and supplied by
waters rained down and collected within Caverns of the earth, as it has
vulgarly taken place among many, so it is very suspicious; experience tells us,
that many perennal Fountains spring forth out of sandy and every where about
dry Mountains, whereunto notwithstanding but little is contributed by the
moisture of the heavens, since the rain falls but seldom, (as in Egypt, and
other places,) and the Sun is very hot, the Country very dry, insomuch that did
the rain fall in twice that quantity, it would scarce be sufficient to irrigate
the soil, much less of supplying moisture for Fountains.

2. Many Fountains draw their water very deep, near a hundred foot, yea two or
three hundred deep out of the earth: Whereas rain seldom penetrates deeper into
the earth than ten or eleven foot.

3. Some Fountains break forth out of Rocky Mountains, which are incapable of
imbibing rain: Ergo their rice and continuation are not from rain.

II. The opinion of Aristotle is much more absurd, asserting subterraneous air
converted into water to be the cause of Springs, since we have formerly made it
appear, that the conversion of air into water is impossible; or were it not, it
would seem very irrational to suppose the earth to be so hollow as to be
capable of containing such an infinite quantity of air, as to continuate the
course of a Fountain; because a great quantity of air condensed (as they call
it) would produce but little more than a drop For one drop of water in an
AEolipile is attenuated into a great blast of wind or air as the vulgar may
call it: Ergo, etc.
.

III. 1. In brief Fountains owe their beginning and continuation to great
quantities of water collected within great Caverns of the earth. This the
diggers of Mines confirm to us, who sometime through digging too deep meet with
great and sudden burstings out of waters, which often do prove perennal. Such
mischances have happened not once in the Coal-pits near Newcastle, to the
drowning of many a man. Moreover there are no great hills, but which rest upon
great gulphs of water underneath them, insomuch that a hill is nothing else but
the raising of the earth through a great gulf of water lodging underneath it.
Hence it is that hills are generally the storehouses of Rivers, and their
sides or tops their Springs. How many slouds of water are there discovered to
break out of the sides of several great hills in Kent, Surrey, and innumerous
other places of the world? Whence should those pregnant Pewter Mines in
Cornwall, or Lead Mines in Derbishire, and all other Mines in the world be
supplied with a sufficient quantity of water for their matter, were it not that
the hills afforded it out of their Caverns? Whereout should all those vast
stony and rocky Mountains of the Universe consist, but out of water derived
from the Earths bowels? Whence should those great perennal Rivers, that spout
forth from under the Alps and Peruvian Mountains take their rice, but from
those gulphs of water, whereby they are raised to that height? Whence should
all the water of those great Lakes upon hills arrive? As that between the
middle of the three tops of the hill Taihu in China, whose depth was yet never
fathomed; and that upon the Mount Jenkin near the City So, being of no less
depth, and near a quarter of a Mile in compass; likewise that of Tieuchi near
Mien; that deep Lake upon the Mount Tienlu called the Lake of the Drake,
because it is so horrible through its depth and commotion, that if any should
cast a stone into it, it would render a great noise like unto a thunder:
besides many others in Europe; as those in Ireland, etc.

In fine, do not all the greatest Rivers of the world, viz. Ganges, Nilus,
Senaga, Nuba, Tana, Nieper, Morava, Garumna, Thames, etc. yea, and all others
spout out of hills, or are they not derived from Lakes? Lakes usually are
environned by a Plain, because those waters, which should thrust up hills about
them are collected in an open Cavern. Notwithstanding are the same waters of
Lakes through the ait's pressure forced underneath into the earth, where at
some distance they do cast up hills, for to disburden the earth, whereat they
spout out Rivers; for a Lake is incapable of it self to spout out a River,
because being situated low wants force to spout it out from it, whereas waters,
that are protruded and continually impacted and crushed very thick or close into
Caverns of hills, do by a renitency press against the earth above and below,
and swallow up the air contained within the said Caverns into their substance,
and the earth does reciprocally press against them; but the air being thin,
smooth and glib, is at last violently protruded by both their gravities, which
erupting with a great force and discontinuation of the earth, does make way
upwards for the water to be pressed out the easier by the earth with such a
force, as may square to the protruding of a long River: Wherefore it is
necessary, that Rivers should derive either immediately or mediately from
hills: Thus immediately the Rhein springs forth out of the Mount Adula alias
Vogel; The Danow out of a Mount within the black wood some 6 Leagues off from
Tubingen; The Necker out of another near the same Town; The Garona out of one
of the Perinean Mountains; The Jaxartes out of the Sogdian Mountains, as
Ptolomy names them; The Dnieper out of some Mountains near Dnieperco; The River
of Jordan out of two Issues of the Mount Lebanon, viz. Jor and Dan, both which
meeting communicate in one name of Jordan; The River Euphrates out of the Mount
standing in the midst of the Garden of Eden; The Boetis in Spain, out of the
Mount Orespeda near Castao; The Anien out of the Mountains among the Trebani;
the Zepusium out of some Mountain in Poland; and so a million of others.
Mediately, The River of Nile descends out of some Hills, that draw their water
out of the Lake Zembre. The River Niger salies vigorously out of some hills
near the Lake Borno, whose Caverns are filled the length of threescore Leagues
under ground by streams flowing out of a Lake between Guidan and Vangue: The
River Nuba out of Mountains deriving their water from the Lake Nuba, and in
like manner many others. Touching narrow short Rivers, that flow from their
head downwards to a low place, they may draw their rice immediately from a
Lake, because they need not that vigor of impulse.

IV. Holland and Zealand although very rich in water, yet are poo^ in
Mountains, because their ground is so much through soakt and masht with water,
that being changed into a mud, it would sooner break into crumbs, than be raised
up into hills. Wherefore the name of Holland was very aptly imposed upon that
Country, since that underneath it is hollow, filled up only with water, the
ground swimming atop it in the form of clay or mud, they having little or no
sandy ground within their dikes or banks.

Hence it appears, that toward the constitution of a Hill these conditions
must be required.

1. A great quantity of water must be bored underneath the Earth; for a small
quantity would prove invalid to lift it up.

2. They must form their Cavern very deep; for near the Surface they would
sooner break through than raise the earth.

3. The ground under which they bore must be very dense, dry and sandy for to
keep in the water; for were it moist or loose, it would not rise, but sooner
break: Besides, this density and sandiness of the earth does serve to
concentrate and conclomerate the earth into one body, whereby it is gradually
raised and lifted up. From this discourse observe, why hills are sandy and dry,
although containing such a bulk of water underneath them, viz. because of the
closeness or density of the minima's or sands of the earth compelling the water
under them.

2. The reason why all hills do not emit fountains of water, is because the
water is lodged very deep under them, or because of the extreme density of
their terrestrial minima's.

V. This cannot but confute that improbable opinion, asserting hills to be
formed through the violence of the waters after the Deluge, carrying great
pieces of the earth along with them in returning to their receptacle: another
reason against this is, because great torrents, tumbling down with a
tempestuous fury, and causing an Inundation or Deluge wherever they touch,
scarce leave any sign of inequality of the earth behind them.

2. Here may then be demanded from them, how and whence those hills before or
after the Deluge of Noah, or of Og^ges, or Deucaleon (it is the same) received
their formation? Hills there were before; for besides the Bible, Josephus,
Abydenus, Berosus and others make mention of a very high hill in Armenia major
called Barin, by others Chardaeus, whereupon a pious man should have saved
himself in an Ark. So Ovid speaks of the Mount Parnassus, whose height should
have preserved Deucaleon with his wife Pyrrha from the rage of the Deluge.
Others to save the matter have conceited the Stars to have attracted lumps out
of the earth, and so raised them into hills; but this opinion is so absurd,
that it needs no confutation. The Vulgar observing most hills to be sandy do
beyond all reproof believe, that they are nothing else but congestions of sand
or earth, heaped up by the winds. I shall not think it much to insert their
judgment touching a very high hill in Holland situated a mile off from the
Hague toward Shiveling, and (...) called the High Clift, which about a hundred
years ago, they say was of that height that one might have washed his hand in
the clouds upon the top of it, but now is diminisht to one third, to what it
was, and I my self can remember that it was much higher than now it is. The
cause of this diminution they adscribe to the winds, blowing down the sands,
out of which they say all those small hills, that are about it, were formed.
But to rectify their apprehensions; who can rationally judge, that winds are
forcible enough to remove hills of that weight and bigness, or that winds
should be strong enough to heap up such a Mountain? Any one would sooner
imagine the winds to blow them down: If then winds have not the power to raise
a Mountain, certainly they are too weak to pull one down. Or thus, If winds be
so powerful, why did they not blow down such hills before they came to that
height?

2. Hills in many Islands of the West Indies are raised much higher, where the
winds are much more out ragious: Wherefore the cause of the diminution of the
forementioned High Clift must be adscribed to the removal of the water
underneath (whereby the hill does gradually sink and grow lesser,) and boring
further into several places about has raised those other hills.

VI. But since hills are so numerous, Lakes and Rivers not scarce, a
disquisition must be made, whence and how such a vast quantity of water does
redound within the bowels of the earth.

The peregrin Element of water within the earth bears no proportion of
affording a competent moisture toward the casting up of so many monstrous
Mountains, or scattering such large perennal Fountains and Rivers, or of
depressing the Surface of the earth by such vast Lakes: Wherefore I say nothing
appears full enough to effuse such dimensions of water but the Ocean alone,
whose belly being oppressed with an inexhaustible plenitude is constantly
irritated to vomit up its superfluities into the weaker and lower parts of the
earth. Reason will incline us to this truth: that must be the original of
waters, whereinto they are disburdened (for otherwise if the Sea did retain all
those waters evacuated by Rivers, it would manifestly increase, but since it
does not, it is an argument that the Sea expels as much as it receives;) but
that is the Ocean, Ergo.

2. Many Lakes, Fountains and Rivers, although remote from the lips of the Sea,
do notwithstanding participate of the flowing and ebbing thereof, as that
Fountain in the Island Gades, another near Bordeaux, etc. ergo the sea does
press water thither.

3. The divine words of Solomon confirm the same to us, Eccl. 1. 7. Unto the
Place from whence the Rivers come, thither do they return again, but that is
into the Sea, Ergo.

4. The ancient Churchmen do also subscribe to this, viz. Isidor, lib. 3. de
Orig. Cap. 20. Basil. Hom. 4. Hex. Jerome upon Eccles. 1. Damasc. lib. 2. de
sid. orth. c. 9. Hugo de S. Vict. upon Genesis Dionys. upon Prove. 8. etc.

The manner of the Seas conveyance or passage to the innermost parts of the
earth is by screwing, pressing, and penetrating through the lowermost parts;
for there the Sea is most potent, exercising its weight refracted to the sides,
whereas atop it is too weak, or were it strong enough, it would break forth
before it had passed any considerable way. Besides its own weight the saltness
of the Sea does very much conduce to the intending of its force; for those
salin particles are apt to undergo a dividing and cutting pressure.

VII. Places, that are bordering upon the Sea, are always and every where cast
up into high hills or mountains, because they receive the first impulse of the
Sea waters pressing underneath; Hence it is, that every where about, the Coasts
are encompassed by hills. Mountains are often higher and greater within the Land
than near the Sea, because they are raised by the meeting of great quantities
of water impelled from two Seas; So the Alps are cast up by the water impelled
from the Venetian Gulf of the one side, and the Tyrrhenian Sea of the other,
both meeting under them. The Peak of Teneriffe is thrust up to the height of
threescore miles through casting up all that ground, into whose room a great
depth of water is succeeded undermining it all about. The Island Ferro is not
irrigated atop with any fluent moisture, as Lake, River, or Springs (except
only with the abundant droppings of a tree drawing moisture from a great depth,
or by collecting the dew of the air, which suffices to quench the thirst of
all the Inhabitants and their Cattle;) because consisting throughout of high
Mountains, their sand lying very close deep, and heavy, does detain the water
underneath them.

The earth is much more depressed under the torrid Zone, and as much more
raised toward the Poles, because the Ocean being gathered into a vast body
under the forementioned Zone depresseth all the land under it and near to it
with one collected and united force of weight toward the Poles, which does
undoubtedly assure me that under both Poles Artick and Antartick the firm land
does stick out far above the waters: And questionless Greenland is protracted
quite throughout the Northern polar Region.

The Mountain Serra Leona in AEthiopia bearing up to the height of the clouds
(wherewith the top is always beset,) although raised within the torrid Zone,
is suffulted by a great gulf collected through the meeting of two or more
parts of the Sea under ground; And whole Africa seems to be inflated into high
mountains from the limits of Egypt until the farthest part of the Atlantic
mountain through communication of Lakes, which again arise out of the concourse
of waters propelled from the Mediterranean, Eruthrean, Ethiopian, and
Atlantic Seas. Arabia is likewise lofty through hills vaunting upon waters
immitted from the Persian and Arabian Gulphs.

Muscovia and Lithuania are for the greater part Champian Countries, because
their soil is too much soakt for to be raised up into hills. 2. By reason of
the multiplicity of Lakes and Rivers, through which the subterraneous waters
are vented.

Sweden, Norway, Scania are very abundantly watered with Lakes and Rivers; the
Sea upon those Coasts exceeds in depth the length of Ships Cables: The reason
is because those waters are very much intended in their pressure downwards
through the vast number of cold and frosty minima's raining down from the North
Pole.

VIII. Before I digress from the subject of this Chapter I am only to show you
the possibility of Marin waters their pressure out from the depth of the Ocean
in to the innermost parts of the earth. This I shall easily accomplish in
mentioning, that the force of fresh waters within the land have molded through
the ground the length of many Leagues; if so, the same is much more possible to
salt water. The River Niger bores through a heavy, dense and deep ground the
length of 60 miles, before it evacuates it self into the Lake Borno. The River
Nuba does likewise force a Cavern many miles long into the earth. The Spaniards
vaunt excessively of a long Bridge, whereon ten thousand Goats and Sheep reap
their pasture, and is nothing else but the passing of the River Anas (alias
Guadiana) the dimension of 8 or 9 Leagues underground, beginning to disappear
near Medelina. The Tigris runs her self under ground on one side of the mount
Taurus, and comes up again on the other side, and beyond the Lake Thorpes hides
it self again within the earth 18 miles further. Camden in his Britannia makes
observation of the River Mole in Surrey diving under ground near white hill,
and appearing again a mile or two thence near Letherhed bridge. Historians tell
us that the Alphaeus floats secretly under ground as far as Sicily, where with
its appearance makes choice of a new name, viz. Arethusa, famous for gulping up
of offals, that had been cast into the Alphaeus at the Olimpick Games usual
every fifth year. The Danow runs some miles under ground, before it flows into
the Sava. Upon the top of the mount Stella is a certain Lake near 12 Leagues
distant from the Sea, which often vomits up wracks of Ships, that were cast away
at Sea.

CHAP. XII. Of the causes of the effects produced by Fountains.
1. Whence some Fountains are deleterious; The cause of the effect of the
Fountain Lethe, of Cea, Lincystis, Arania; The causes of foecundation and of
rendering barren of other Fountains; The causes of the properties of the
Fountain of the Sun, of the Eleusinian waters, of the Fountains of Illyrium,
Epyrus, Cyreniaca, Arcadia, the Holy Cross, Sibaris, Lycos, of the unctious
Fountain of Rome, and Jacobs Fountain. 2. The causes of the effects of Ipsum
and Barnet Wells. 3. Whence the virtues of the Spaw waters are derived. 4. Of
the formal causes of Baths.


1. THe Fountains of Thrace, Arcadia, Sarmatia, Armenia, Lydia, and Sicilia are
deleterious through the permixtion of crude arsernical juyces, transpiring out
of the earth. The same causes operate the same effects in the Founts of
Wolchenstein, Valentia, Berosus, etc. The Lethe of Boeotia owes its effects to
crude Mercurial vapors immixt within its substance: Another in the same
Country produces a contrary effect through a succinous exhalation. The
Fountains of Cea and Susae differ little in causality from the Lethe. The
Lincystis inebriates the brain through repletion by sulphurous exhalations. The
Fountain of Arania makes use of crude nitrous juyces for the accomplishing of
its effects. The Fountain, which Solinus affirms to conduce to foecundity, must
be a thoroughly attenuated and well concocted water, like to that of the Nile.
The other opposite to this in operation must be very Saturnal. A sulphurous
Nitre, or a mixture of Sulphur and Nitre into one close juice, dispersed
through the waters of the Fountain of the Sun among the Garamantes, renders
them very cold in the day time, because the Nitre then predominating condenseth
and incrassates the waters, the more because its sulphurous parts, which do
otherwise rarefie them, are through the Suns beams extracted, disunited, and
dispersed: Whereas in the night season the sulphurous parts, ben^g united
through the condensing cold of the night and condensation of the nitrous
particles, turn into an internal flame, causing that fervent heat. The
Eleusinian waters are irritated to a fermentation of heterogeneous mineral
juyces through the percussion of the air by a sharp musical string, whereby
through continuation the waters are likewise percussed and its contenta
stirred. In the same manner is the next related fountain cast into an
exestuation through the shrill acute vibrating and penetrating percussion of
the air by the lips, whereas the walking about stirring the air but obtusely
cannot effect such a penetrative or acute motion. The Fountain of Illyrium
contains secret Vitriolat sulphurous flames within its substance, whereby it
proves so consuming. The Fountains of Epyrus and Cyreniaca vary in heat, by
reason of the greater or lesser dispersing and rarefying, or uniting and
condensing of their sulphurous flames. Springs remain cool in the Summer
through the rarefaction of their fiery spirits exhaling and passing out of the
ground in the Summer; they produce a small warmth through the condensation of
their igneous particles in the Winter. That Fountain of Arcadia exercises such
a penetrable concentrating force upon Gold and Silver through the quantity and
strength of its nitrous spirits, which are only obtused by a Mules hoof,
through the Lentor and obtuseness of its body, and therefore may easily be
contained in it. The Fountain of the Holy Cross appears red through the
admixture of red bole. The overflowing of Fountains for a certain space depends
upon the pressure of a greater quantity of water thither, which in the Summer
time may prove more copious through the attenuation of the water and
rarefaction of the earth. The reason of their detumescence after their
repletion is the waters further impression toward other parts, or repression
thither whence they came, through the expiration of the air flatuosities out
the mouths of the Fount, whence the earths gravity depresseth them back again.
Those that increase and decrease with the course of the Moon, or rather of the
Ocean, vary through the change of the universal Tides, of which has been
sufficiently treated above. Touching the Lithopoetick virtue of waters, it is
much agreeing with that of the earth, of which above. The Sibaris causes
sneezing through its acre and vitriolat spirits. Some waters are apt to change
the temperament of the body into a cold or phlegmatic disposition causing the
hair of Cattle to be protruded with a fair color; others into a choleric
habit, causing the hair to be of a reddish color. The Fountain Lycos is
unctious, and therefore serves to burn in a Lamp. Whether to adscribe the
egurgitation of that oily Spring, discovered near the Incarnation of our
Savior, to the collection of unctious exhalations permisted with water, or to
a miracle, both being possible, I leave to the inclination of your belief: But
the disclosing of a false swearer (if there be a Fountain of that virtue) is an
extraordinary impression of God upon the waters. Jacobs Fountain changes in
color and motion through the fermentation of various heteregeneous bodies
contained within it.

II. Wells are distinguished from Fountains, in that the former do often appear
in a plain or valley, as the foot of a hill, and are subject to fill up and
after to be dried up again; Neither do they spout out water with a force like
unto Fountains. Ipsum and Barnet Wells operate their effects through a thick
Chalchantous or Vitriolat juice, which through its sulphurous particles
irritates the belly to excretion, and through its subtiller spirits to urine.
By the way you must not imagine that their admixture is right and true Vitriol;
for in distillation by the color of the subsidence it does appear otherwise:
Neither is the taste a perfect vitriolat taste, or their operation so nauseous
as Vitriol dissolved in water. Besides those juyces are indisposed to
concretion into Vitriol, since these are more sulphurous and less digested:
Nevertheless they are somewhat like to Vitriol in taste, operation, and grayness
of color, as being nearest to green. Although the main effect is adscribed to
a Vitriolat like juice, it hinders not but that some Ferrugineous and Aluminous
juyces may be commixt with them. Tunbridge waters are impregnated with a thin
chalchantous spirit, whereby they are usually pierced through with the urine,
except in some delicate fine bodies, whose bellies partake likewise of their
effect.

III. Among the Spaw waters as Pouhont and Savenier agree in virtue with those
of Tunbridge so likewise in their causes; And Geronster with Ipsum.
Nevertheless Hendricus van Here does not forbear, lib. de Acid. Spadan. cap. 5.
imputing their effects to red Chalck, which he found, together with some Oker
and a little Vitriol, upon the bottom of the body of the Still after
distillation of the waters. I wonder how he guessed those substances so
readily, which had nothing in them like to the said bodies but their color.
Besides the red chalck he named the mother of Iron: A wise saying. In effect
those subsidences were nothing else but the caput mortuum of the forementioned
chalchantous juyces, whose subtiller parts being abstracted and exhaled left
the courser insipid, like to what the caput mortuum of Vitriol uses to be. But
pray who ever knew ^ed Chalck or Oket to be eccoprotick or diuretic?
Particularly he found Geronster to leave dregs, which being cast upon a red hot
Iron would not yield to liquefaction; Ergo it must be steel he concluded.
Neither would his Oker or Chalk have melted presently, because they were
deprived of their Sulphur. But will the infusion of Steel purge by stool and
urine like those waters? Certainly no. Ergo their purgative ingredient must
have been a crude chalchantous juice.

Fallopius beyond him attests to have found Alume, Salt, green Vitriol,
Plaster, Marble and chalk in those waters, which they call Physical waters: a
mere guess, these partaking in nothing but color, and scarce that, with the
forenamed Minerals. Doubtless nature had never intended them for such bodies.

Touching the commistions of these juyces with the waters, they do immediately
mix with them as soon as they are exhaled out of the earth, which had they been
intended for those pretended kind of Minerals, nature would have locked them up
in a matrix.

IV. Baths derive their natures from the actual hidden flames of a thick and
dense sulphurous and chalky matter, the proportion of which do cause a greater
or lesser ebullition.

The waters of the Rivers descending out of the Alps breed such congestions
under the throat through a permixture of coagulating and incrassating
particles, to wit, of nitrous juyces.

Touching the other properties of Rivers we have already treated of them, and
therefore judge their repetition needless.

CHAP. XIII. Of the various Tastes, Smells, Congelation and Choice of Water.

sents of waters. 3. The causes of the said tastes. That the saltness of the Sea
is not generated by the broyling heat of the Sun. The Authors opinion. 4. The
causes of the sents of Waters. 5. What Ice is, the cause of it, and manner of
its generation. Why some Countries are less exposed to frosts than others that
are nearer to the Line. 6. The differences of frosts. Why a frost does usually

minims. Why fresh waters are aptest to be frozen. How it is possible for the
Sea to be frozen. 8. What waters are the best and the worst: the reasons of
their excellency and badness.


I. Water besides its own natural taste, of which we have spoken above, is
distinguished by the variety of adventicious tastes, viz. some are sharp and
sour, as the Savenier, Tunbridge waters, and those near Gopingen in Suevia and
others near Lyncestus in Macedonia. Others are of a sweet taste as the water of
the River Himera in Sicily; Those of the River Liparis have a fat taste. Some
waters in the Isles Andros, Naxos, and Paphlagonia do taste like wine.

The waters of the Fountain Campeius are bitter, and flowing into the river
Hipanis in Pontus infects it with the same taste. There are other fountains
between the Nile and the red Sea that agree with the former in taste, likewise
those of Silicia near Corycius. The pit waters of Galniceus are acerbous. The
salt taste of waters is unknown to none since the Ocean is pregnant enough with
it. Some inland Lakes and Fountains are of the same taste, viz. Three in
Sicilia, the Concanican, Agrigentinian Lakes, and another near Gela. There is
another called Myrtuntius of the same relish between Leucades and the Ambracian
Gulf. The Taus in Phrygia, Thopetis in Babylonia, Asphaltites in Judaea, Sputa
in Media Atropacia, Mantianus in Armenia, one in Cyprus near Citium, another
between Laodicea and Apamia, two in Bactria, another near the Lake Moeotis, and
that of Yaogan, Forrien, besides many more are all of a saltish taste. Touching
Fountains there is one in Narbone exceeding the Sea in saltness. There are six
more of the same taste near the Adriatic gulf, where it bends toward
Aquileia; besides several other salt pits in Italy, Illyris, Cappadocia, etc.

II. Waters vary no less in their sent: Some stinking, as the Lake between
Laodicea and Apamia, the Fountain among the Phalisci, another near Leuca in
Calabria, and those rivulets near the Lake Asphaltites, etc. Others give a
sweet sent as the Fountain of Cabara in Mesopotamia. The Pit Methone in
Peloponesus smells like a Salve.

III. Next let me make address to the causes of these qualities: A sharp taste
is derived from those acute and Vitriolate particles immixt in the water. A
sweet taste is produced in water through an exact aerial mixtion or percoction
with it. The waters of Paphlagonia afford a vinous taste through the admixture
of tartareous exhalations, or such as are like to the mixture of Tartar of
wine. Bitterness flows from adust terrestrial particles admixt to waters.
Aluminous exhalations dispersed through water render it acerbous. The saltness
of the Sea and other Inland waters is communicated to them from the admixture
of saltish particles exhaling out of the mud. Touching the generation of salt
and its mixtion I have inserted my opinion above, I shall here only have a word
or two with those that state the Sun the efficient cause of the said saltish
particles, broyling and aduring those exhalations contained with the body of
the waters; whence they assert the superficial parts of the Sea to be more
saltish than the lower parts of it, because the Suns heat is more vigorous
there. If the broyling Sun be the efficient, whence is it then that some Lakes
and Fountains are very salt, where the Sun does not cast its aduring beams?

2. It is very improbable, that so vast a number of saltish partiticles should
be generated in the torrid Zone, (where the Sun does only broyle) as to infect
the waters within the polars, that are so remote thence: How then is it, that
the waters prove as saltish there, where the cold is as potent as the heat
elsewhere, as in Greenland? Or absurdly supposing the Sea to be so far
communicative of its savor, why does it not obtain a power of changing those
sweet waters, which it is constrained to harbor within it self? As those,
which Columbus relates to have found in the American Sea, near to the road of
the Drakes head: Moreover he attests to have sailed through fresh water a
hundred and four Leagues far in the North Sea. Pliny, lib. 2. c. 103. affirms
the same, viz. to have discovered fresh water near Aradus in the Mediterranean,
and others by the Chaledonian Islands. And in lib. 6. c. 17. he reports that
Alexander Magnus had drank a draught of Sea water that was fresh, and that
Pompey when he was employed against Mithridates should have tasted of the same.

3. The Ocean being always in such an agitation cannot be a fit matrix to
concrease or unite such mixtures.

4. The broyling Sun does rather render salt waters, fresh as has been
experienced among Seamen by exposing pails of Sea water upon the deck to the
torrid Sun under the Line, which after a while standing do become much fresher.
An open heat doubtless sooner dissolves a mixture than it generates one; for
boil Seawater long upon the fire, and it will grow fresh; or distill it, and
you will find the same effect. Beyond all scruple these saltish particles must
be united into such mixtures out of earth proportioned to the other Elements in
a close place or matrix (yet not so close as to concrease them into a fixed
subterraneous body or mineral) whose coldness does adact, impact, and bind the
said Elements into an union and mixture, which through defect of an entire
closeness do soon exhale or transpire. In a word, the saltness of the Sea is
generated within its mud, whose closeness impacts and coagulates the
exhalations of the earth into salin particles, whence they are soon disturbed
through the motion of the Sea, and the attracting heat of the Sun. Hence it is,
that old mud, clay, and such like bodies prove generally saltish, so that the
Sun adds little excepting in the stirring up of the said exhalations. And
touching the foregoing instance of the waters greater saltness atop than below,
it is fictitious; for the Sea is much fuller of salt below than above, because
of its weight. Nevertheless the Sea does taste more saltish atop than below,
because the subtiller parts of the Salt are attracted or forced by the heat of
the Sun toward the top, which meeting there are apt to strike the tongue more
piercing than otherways. But whence these fresh waters do burst up into the
Sea is worth our inquiry: To resolve you, you must know that the earth in many
places under water is raised up into hills, or shallows analogal to them, whose
earth atop lying very close does hinder the water above it from passing,
especially in the Northern Climate, where the Sea is somewhat thicker than
under the Line: but is nevertheless bursted through propulsion of the waters
underneath, which evacuated into the body of the Sea do cause that extent of
fresh water without suffering themselves to be infected with the Saltness of
the Sea, because the Seawater is so thick and closs, that it excepts the fresh
water from making an irruption into its continuity: Hence it is, that the River
of the Amazons, besides many others although irrupting into the Sea many
Leagues far, yet is maintained impolluted and fresh. But why those salin
particles should be generated near to those fresh springs, and not close about
them may seem strange: It is because one ground is muddy and disposed to
generate salt, the other about the said spring is sandy, dry That is underneath
some what what remote from the reach of the water atop.
(as it were) and close, and not at all masht through as mud is. The Seawater
deposes its saltness in being percolated through the earth suffering the
subtiller parts alone of the waters to pass, but keeping back the grosser and
salin ones.

IV. Sents are materiated out of the subtiller parts of the matter effecting
tastes; wherefore all waters, that are discernable by tastes, emit their
subtiller parts for sents; but of this abundantly before, whither I must direct
my Reader.

V. Ice is water congealed, or incrassated, indurated, or rather reduced to its
natural state. That which congeales the water or reduces it to its natural
state is the absence or expulsion of those Elements, that render it fluid, viz.
fire and air. These are expelled by frosty minima's falling down from the
Poles, and compressing or squeezing them both out of the body of water, whence
it is also that all waters swell through the frost, viz. through their
repletion with the said minima's. These are nothing but Unites or points of
earth adunited to so many unites of water freed within their body from all air
and fire, and detruded from the Polars toward the earth, whither they are
vigorously forced down in a very close order into the Surface of the waters,
where arriving they press out the air and fire, which being expelled, the
superficial parts of the water cleave naturally to one another about those
frosty minima's. The first beginning of a frost is taken from the first
decidence of frosty minima's, which in their passing cause a vehement
compression, and lighting upon our tact make us give them the name of cold
(because they compress our external parts with a smart continuous compression;)
thence falling upon the water (if in a small quantity only) do thicken it a
little, if in a greater do forcibly expel the air and fire, which being
expelled a concretion of the water near its Surface must naturally follow. If
now it grows no colder, and that these minima's fall in no greater quantity,
the Ice continues at a stand; but if otherwise, then it proceeds to a greater
induration and a larger concretion: And the deeper the waters do thicken, the
more acute the cold must be, or the greater quantity of acute and dense
minima's must follow for to further and continuate the said concretion, because
unless they are acuter than the former, they will not be minute enough to pass
the small porosities remaining in the Surface of the Ice. Ice swimmeth atop the
water, as long as it freezeth, not because it is less weighty, (for it is
heavier;) but because its continuity and concretion together with the support
of the air tending from the ground of the waters toward its own Element do
detain it. When it thawes the Ice sinks down, because it is somewhat
discontinued and melted, and by reason of the same proportion of air descending
and bearing down upon it, that was ascended before. Notwithstanding the thaw
people do often complain of a great cold two or three days after, and especially
in their feet, which is nothing else but the same frosty minima's repassing out
of the earth and water toward the Element of air for to give way to the
melting entering air and fire.

The frosty minima's that begin to fall with a red Evening sky denoting the
clearness of the air and passage, do often bring a furious cold with them,
because finding no obstruction they fall very densely and acutely upon us; but
those, that fall through a cloudy air seldom cause violent colds, because they
are partly detained by the same clouds: Hence it is, that most Countries, that
are beset with water (as Islands, peninsuls, etc.) and thence attain to a
nebulous air, are warmer, than other Countries although the former be remoter
from the Ecliptic than these, because their clouds obstruct and detain a part
of the frosty minima's, and break the rest in their motion downwards: Whence it
is also that England is less cold in the Winter than most parts of France or
Germany, although both are of a less Northern declination than it. The same
clouds do likewise in the Summer break the violence of the fiery minima's
descending, whence it is also less hot here than in the forementioned places,
no wonder then, if Geographers do so much extol this Island for the
temperature of its Climate.

VI. This language is supplied with a very apt distinction of frosts, viz. a
black frost, a gray, and a white frost.

The first of these is felt to be of the greatest fury, insomuch that if it
proves for any time lasting, it deads the roots of young plants and old trees,
kills all Vermin, and penetrates through the very periostium of Animals, and
depth of Rivers. It derives its violence from the extreme number of the
descending frosty minima's, whose density makes the Skies even look black again.

A gray frost is between a black and white one, consisting likewise of a dense
proportion of descending minima's.

A white frost is the incrassation of vapors in the lowermost region of the
air. Among these a black frost is of the least continuance, because the frosty
minima's tumbling down in such vast quantities are soon purged out of the air.

Here may be inquired, why a frost usually begins and ends with the change of
the Moon. For solving of this, you must observe; that the causes of the
decidence are,

1. Their great number. 2. Their congregating or congress.
Touching the first, unless their number is proportionable to bore and press Or
rather to be bo^ed or pr^fied through.
through the clouds and resistance of the air, they are incapable of descension
for to cause a congelation: and although their number be great and dispersed,
they are nevertheless retained through the over-powering of the clouds:
Wherefore it is necessary a great quantity should be united into heaps, and so
make their way through.

To these principal causes add this adjuvant one, viz. The compression of the
Moon, she at her changes driving the frosty minima's more forcibly toward the
Poles, through which impulsion they are withal thrusted one upon the other and
united into a body, whence it is that they at those times do often take their
beginning of decidence. Again the Moon near the same terms impelling the clouds
and thick air thither does prove as frequent an occasion of dispersing those
frosty minima's, especially if much diminished of their body through preceding
decidencies. Moreover these frosty minima's, although they are sometimes broken
and dispersed in their decidence through the said impulses, yet sometimes they
do recover a body, and make a new irruption downwards: And thence it is, that
often times a frost holds for a day or two, then thaws for as long, and
afterward returns to freezing again.

VII. In the next place I am to set down the original and rice of these frosty
minima's. You may easily apprehend, that the Sun in the Torrid Zone and
somewhat in the temperate one does daily raise a vast number and quantity of
vapors And likewise the air about the Poles irrupting into the water as you
may read in the next Chapter.
, (consisting of most water, then air, next fire and earth) which through the
diurnal motion of the air, are carried along from East to West. And through
daily successions of new vapors they are compelled to detrude their preceding
ones toward the Poles, whither they seem most to tend through the disposition
of water and earth contained within those vapors, and the greater force of the
heavens driving them toward the Poles as the weaker places, (for there motion
is least observed,) where being arrived, are by the privative coldness of that
Region assisted to free themselves of the fire and air; the water now cleaving
to the earth and divided into millions upon millions of minima's make up a
dense body, whence through the depression of the air they are devolved down to
the earth.

Waters, that are least in motion, less fiery and aerial, are most disposed to
concretion: Hence fresh waters are aptest to be frozen: Whereas the Sea is
seldom reduced to concretion, because of its continual motion expelling the
frosty minima's as fast as they are received, or precipating them to the
bottom, or by melting their body through the fiery salin and aerial particles
contained within it. Notwithstanding is the Sea reduced to concretion in some
Climates, viz. within the Polars, where you have the Oceanus Glacialis or Icy
Ocean, whose Ice is in some places 60 or 80 fathom deep, in others reaching
from the bottom of the Sea to the top; insomuch that the tops of many of those
Icy mountains stick out as far above the Surface of the liquid Sea, as the same
Sea is deep underneath: The properties of that Ice is to be clear and
transparent like glass. Herodotus does likewise make mention of the freezing of
the Bosphorus, so Beda lib. de nature. rer. c. 9. writes, that within a days
sail from the Isle Tyle toward the North the Sea is frozen. Olans Magn. tells
us of the Gothiek Sea being frozen: But this happens, because the Sea
thereabout may be deprived of its saltness, (yea some assert, that those
mountains of Ice are most fresh water concreased) which being precipitated to
the bottom through the density of the frosty minima's constantly descending
like showers under the Pole, the remaining Surface of fresh water is soon
congealed. Before I close this Paragraph, I shall only add the cause of a
strange passion befalling the Glacial Sea, where sometimes of a sudden and in a
moment a whole mountain of Ice is melted away, causing a dangerous current,
subverting or carrying away many a ship, and yet the frost continues: The
cause of this is not the broyling and melting heat of the Sun, for the Sun is
never so kind there, but the union of those fiery salin particles, precipitated
(as we told you above) by the frosty minims down into the mud, whence working
or bursting with an united condensed force upwards do occasion such sudden
degelations.

VIII. Lastly, Waters in respect of wholsomness differ very much in excellency
and choice: Spring water, and those of Rivers are commended above others of
Pools, Lakes, and Pit waters, because these latter through their standing still
contract a muddiness and filth out of the earth, and sometimes noxious
particles co gulated out of exhalations transpiring out the said mud; besides
that they are disposed to putrefactions through the abundance of peregrin
bodies, protruding venomous herbs, and generating Toads, Frogs, Leeches,
Snails, Eeles, and other filthy Insects. Snow waters are no less noxious than
the former, because of their crudity, nitrosity, and thickness. Waters gathered
and kept in a Leaden Cistern through Leaden or Tin spouts are crude and windy,
because they descend out of the cold region of the air; Moreover as Galen does
well except, they contract a pernicious quality from the Lead. Wherefore
Fountain or River waters carry the bell before them all; but which of these two
excells the other we must next distinguish. Fountain waters, as they spring out
of the mountains, are yet filled with wind and earthy minima's, and therefore
must yield to River waters, I mean such as are derived from a Fountain: In
these the waters through their rapid streams depose those earthy crude and
windy bodies, which they brought along with them out of the Fountains Cavern,
and are attenuated and clarified through the Sun beams, and lastly depose their
dregs into the earth through being strained through its dense and clear sands.
And among these there is a great difference; those that take their rice from a
standing water or a Lake, and flow through a muddy ground are much inferior to
many fountain waters. But others, that stream rapidly from a bright fountain
and take their course through a pure sandy or gravelly ground, and meet the
East, Sun are the best. River waters in hot Countries, where the air is clear,
are preferred before others in cold Climats: Hence Rivers of a Continent take
place, before those of an Island, because the latter is generally beset with a
nubilous air, filling the said waters with mud, and keeping off the rays of
the Sun from concocting them: Wherefore River waters in the Southeast parts of
France are esteemed before any in England; those of the Southeast parts of
Spain before others of the same Continent, where the River Tago is much
extolled for its wholsomeness of water; In Persia the Choaspis affords the best
waters; In India the Ganges, etc. The Rivers of Thames affords the best water
in England, but further up toward the Woodmongers Gallows and Oxford; not
about London where the ground is muddy, besides that it is infected by the
Tides flowing out of the Sea with many saltish particles, dirt, dung,
carcasses, etc. There must also notice be taken of the rice of a River, viz.
That it do not spring out of a Mine; and of the Countries through which it
passes, whether Chalky, Gravelly, or Clayish. Insumma waters, that are the
lightest, thinnest, clearest and most limpid, of no strong tangue, but of a
sweet and pleasing relish, are the best. The weight of waters is known by
weighing one with the other in Scales: By letting them run through a small
sieve or thick close linen: their tenuity is known by dropping them upon a
Looking-glass, whereof that which drops the least drops and makes the greatest
splatch is the subtillest; by distillation, boiling, dissolving Salt or Soape
in them; by their shaking, smalness, and number of streams; by the swimming of
a piece of wood in them, viz. that wherein it smimmeth deepest is the lightest
and thinnest, etc.

CHAP. XIV. Of the commerce of the air with the other Elements.
1. How the air moves downwards. What motions the Elements would exercise
supposing they enjoyed their Center. Why the Air does not easily toss the
terraqueous Globe out of its place. How the Air is capable of two contrary
motions. 2. That the Air moves continually from East through the South to West,
and thence back again to the East through the North. 3. An objection against
the airs circular motion answered. 4. The Poles of the Air. 5. The proportion
of Air to Fire; its distinction into three profundities.


1. AIr is a debtor for its name to aer in Latin, which again to (...), to
lift up, because it was lifted up (as it were) from the Chaos. How it was freed
from the oppression of the weighty Elements I formerly declared. The remainder
is to treat briefly of its commerce with the neighboring Elements, viz. with
Earth, Water, and Fire. Daily observations make appear to us, that a cavity is
no sooner ready to open within the Earth or Water, but the Air is as ready to
strive to enter, not only for to fill up that vacuity, but out of an eagerness,
strife, and necessity for to gain a Center for its whole body: For how can any
body enjoy rest without being sustained by a foundation? That, which is alone
apt for such a work, is the Center, which is a Basis, upon which all its parts
do rest. I prove it: The parts of a body being met about the Center, cannot use
any force or violence against one another, because they are of one nature, and
therefore agree in the same effect: Which is of resting about a Center. Hence
it is, That the air (besides its own interest being straightened atop through
the fires inclination also for to recover its Center) does so much infest,
pierce, attenuate, and divide all bodies, that lie in the way to its Center;
and that so vast a proportion of air is entered into the body of water, as from
a solidity to reduce it to a perfect fluor: And although the body of air (as I
have stated before) is of that softness, yet through succession of its parts
and want of vacuities, whereinto to convey it self, it cannot yield to any
compression into it self, but being successively backed by its own parts and
those of fire, is capable of working the same effects, which the hardest body
can. But now supposing the air to have accomplished its aim, let us inquire
what motion it would then exercise? Certainly of it self no other but its
continuous lightness, whereby it would maintain its parts diffused from its own
center into the greatest tenuity imaginable. Likewise the other Elements would
exercise no other action, but the maintenance of their bodies in the greatest
density, crassitude, or rarity, and that through the use of their formal
contiguous weight, continuous weight, and contiguous levity; and as the earth
through her concentration would not leave the Circumference, although tending
hence thither; so neither would the light Elements desert their Center although
moving thence hither. Wherefore let me advertize you in time not to mistake my
former definitions of Levity, or Gravity, implying the former to move from its
Center to the Circumference; that to move here from the Center is not to leave
it; but to move thence as from a Basis: But now the air being dispossessed of its
genuine Center is forced to make use of a violent Center, situated about the
extreme parts of the earth and water, and thence its parts do take their
original to the circumference, not leaving their force in the mean while of
pressing violently downwards. Here may be inquired, why the air, seeming so far
powerful above the earth and water (both in extent of compass and energy or
activity of parts) that its extreme subtility should seem more than potent
enough to pervade and dispossess that small clot of water and earth, does not
become victorious. I resolve you; The energy of the air is much refracted
through having its Center (upon which all its strength does consist) divided
into that dimension, which the Circumference of earth and water do make; or
otherwise it would soon toss that small footbal out of its place, and make no
more of it than the Heavens may seem to do of the Moon. So fire, although a
great part is flaming and burning, has not the power of invading the earth (as
many do imagine it would do, were the Heavens all a burning fire) because it is
much more refracted in its Center through the Surface of the air: Do we not see
that a Durgain is able to wrestle with a great Giant, because his low stature
does put him in a capacity of taking the other about the middle, where he
easily lifts him from his Basis or Center. But possibly it may seem strange to
you, that the air should exercise two contrary motions, one upwards, and
another downwards. 2. You may likewise demand, how fire can apply any force to
earth or water, since it is extended into its greatest rarity, and possesses a
place full large enough to contain its body, and consequently is not violently
detained. To the first I answer, That naturally a thing cannot obtain two
contrary motions, but violently it may. As to the second, This violence is
caused here below.

1. Through the incrassation of the air, that is, water ascending and mingling
with the body of air does force so much of it to strive for another place, as
it has taken up of the air, which since it cannot procure upwards is forced to
effect downwards upon the earth and water, and make a violent irruption upon
them.

2. The air being essentially thin in the second Region as well as it is above,
must of necessity press down upon the incrassated air, because all its parts
being to take their suffulsion and Basis from somewhere, (which it does from
the hither extremity of the air) and not proving strong enough to sustain such
a force must necessarily depress into the water and earth, where neither of
these finding themselves strong enough about their surface, do necessarily
yield and give way to the air pressing downwards for a Basis. The same contrary
motion is apparent in a man, who is to lift some weight from the ground
upwards: First he must move all his strength toward his feet, which is the
Center, whereupon this weight must be sustained and lifted up from; then does
he reflect all his strength upon that Basis upwards, where we observe his
center to make a hole into the earth, because it is not firm enough to sustain
his pressure; even so it is with the twofold motion of air, which you may
easily apply to this in every particular.

II. The airs innixe being shoved off or refracted through the repercussion of
the weighty Elements chooses to turn round, that is to bear to the sides,
rather than to retort into it self: And that which irritates this with no
obtuse spur is the fire, forcing circularly upon the air.

2. The universal waters flowing from East to West is no small cause of
directing of the airs motion toward the same aim, because the air reflecting
against the waters flowing from underneath must needs be shoved off thither
whither the water flows: I prove it; cast a ball from the shore upon a piece
of Timber, driving down a rapid River, its refracted motion will tend toward
the drift of the said River.

3. The fire moving from East to West, and forcing upon the air must beyond all
scruple prescribe the air a road in its motion.

In the next place I prove that the air is agitated in a circular motion.

1. If waters that are thick are impelled to a circular motion, much more air,
whose fluidity and coherence is much more disposed to a circular motion.

2. Fire is a contiguous body, but that moves circularly; ergo air much more,
because it is continuous. 3. The uppermost clouds are always observed to move
circularly, ergo the air, that does contain them.

4. Comets (whereof some are seated near to the extremity of the supreme Region
of the air) do move circularly, ergo the air must also move circularly.

III. Against the airs circular motion may be objected, that the clouds
swimming in the air like a ship in the water, are carried about with the air;
but the said clouds do move variously, sometimes Eastward, Southward, or
Northward, and c. Ergo the air is also various in its motions. I answer,

1. That the clouds only near the Polars are various in their motion, which
variety is only befalling the inferior clouds: Herein it bears a resemblance
to the motion of water near the Polars varying (although but accidentally) from
the course of the Ocean. Besides that there is a difference in motion between
the superior middle and inferior clouds is manifest by the Moons light about
her quarters, disclosing the inferior clouds to move one way and those above
another way.

2. The clouds do often stream against the tide of the air, as you shall read by
and by.

3. The clouds in the torrid Zone, namely the superior ones, are very uniform
in their motion, constantly floating from East to West.

IV. The air taking its beginning of circular motion underneath about the
Center, the Globe constituted by the weighty Elements must needs be thought to
be its Axletree whereupon it moves: Its Poles must be corresponding to the
North and South extremities of the said Globe, which together with the Axis are
doubtless immovable, and consequently must only be apprehended in the earth,
because that alone is immovable. Here observe, that the air in the torrid Zone
moves swiftest, because it is equidistant from its Poles, and has the most
space to accomplish: Where it is near the Poles its motion is of the least
vigor, and nearest seems to be immovable.

V. The proportion of the Element of air to the Element of fire is the same as
water is to earth: Because air is the same in its respective nature
comparatively to fire, that water is to earth; for as water is a continuous
heavy body immediately superadded to earth, being of a contiguous weight, so is
air a continuous light substance annexed to fire being of a contiguous levity;
wherefore then the same reason infers air to have the same proportion to fire,
that water has to earth. Hence we must conclude that the profundity of the
tract of air is much larger than it is stated by vulgar Astronomists, and the
profundity of fire much less than it is computed by the same phantasticks;
Otherwise it would seem an improportion and disorder in the Elements, not to be
supposed. The profundity of the air we may aptly distinguish into three equal
Sections or Regions.

1. The first or supreme is constituted by air most infested by fire.

2. The middle Region is, where the air is lightest and thinnest, and enjoys
its greater purity.

3. The third Region comprehends those thick visible clouds.

I will begin with the description of the first Region: As far as the uppermost
Region of water is attenuated by the air, so far (considering the diversity of
proportion) is the air also rarefied by fire; and as the air does press down to
the bottom of the waters, even so does the fire in it strive for the Center to
the extreme depth of air, but is much more in proportion in the supreme Region.
The middle Region is purest in her own parts because of the equidistance from
her neighboring Elements, but is nevertheless somewhat nubilous. The lower
Region is as much incrassated with clouds or vapors concreased, and reduced
from its extreme tenuity, as the waters are attenuated and reduced from their
extreme crassitude to that degree of Attenuation through air; Because those
parts of water, whose places are replenisht with others of air, must recede
into the air for to place themselves somewhere.

Against this discourse Nonius lib. de crep. Alhazen. lib. 3. perspect. Vitell.
li. 10. Pr. 60. and others may seem to set themselves, as appears by their
demonstrations although obscure enough, inferring the tract of air not to
exceed 25 Leagues in profundity, because Comets being generated in the air, and
keeping their station there, do seldom or never clime up higher. But on the
contrary, will they assert the Maculae or spots of the Moon, (which doubtless
are aerial and near to the supreme region of the air,) and other clouds that
seem not to be far distant from the Moon, to be no higher than 25 Leagues? An
absurdity. Neither are Comets so near, some appearing but little lower than the
Moon, some higher, others in the same degree of Altitude; so that Comets if any
while durable are not seated in the air, but in the Region of fire, because
they move from East to West with the same swiftness that other lucid bodies do,
that are contained in the fiery Region.

I. Nubes a cloud is derived from (...), and that from (...) to swim, because a
cloud seems to swim in the air. A Cloud is an aerial body engendered out of air
incrassated by water, and somewhat condensed by earth.

Its kinds are very various differing in mixture, magnitude, equality, color,
situation, and motion. Some appear disrupted, discontinuated; others entire,
uniform; Some are great, others small; some even, flat, hollow, unequal; others
are black, red, blew, brown, luminous, dark; others of various colors
reflecting Rainbows; Some are situated in the North, South, etc. Others move
uniformly, difformly, swift, slow, Eastward, Westward, etc.

Their generation is thus; the air and fire irrupting incessantly into the
earth and water are after their arrival thither shut in and cut off from their
bodies, and being violently compressed from all sides, are forced by the
over-powring of the weighty Elements to return to their former region,
whereunto they after some contention do yield, yet not without carrying away a
measure of water and earth, closely adhering to them. These retroceding
particles, as they come out, give entrance to other air attempting an irruption
with its body, whereby To wit, by the crushing of the air tending downwards.
they are elevated continually until they are arrived to that part of the
Region of the air, where it is least infested with the fiery Element; Here the
air finding it self strongest and least oppressed with bodies discontinuating
its substance, does press those heterogeneous bodies together into clouds
through its virtue of moving to an union, and not through its coldness, for air
of it self where it does in any wise enjoy its purity is estranged from cold,
and is naturally rather inclined to warmth. The reason, why clouds are less apt
to concrease where the Sun has power, is, because the parts of the air there
are weakened through the rarefaction and discontinuation by torrid minima's.
These clouds according to their mixture vary in continuation, viz. some are
thicker and more concreased than others, which through their greater renixe are
propelled from the others of a less renitency. Clouds containing much earth,
and thence rendered dense, appear black; if they are much expanded, according to
their diduction, they refract the light variously, appearing red, white, blew,
etc.

The clouds through their gradual proportion of renitency being disrupted and
sinking gradually under one another; refract the light of the Sun according to
their graduall situation, seeming to be illuminated with several and gradual
colors, (whose appearance is called a Rainbow:) viz. The lower being more
thick and dense than the rest refract the light blackish; that above it, being
less dense, brownish; that above this, purple or greenish; the other reddish,
yellowish, etc. A Rainbow is not seen by us, unless we be interposed between
the Sun and the Clouds reflecting and refracting, that is we must stand on that
side of the clouds that is irradiated. In Thomas's Island the Moon does
sometimes cause a light kind of a Rainbow after a rain.

Touching the figure of a Rainbow, it is semicircular, because the air is
expanded in a circular figure, and moved circularly toward us. Many do make a
scruple, whether there ever appeared any Rainbow before the Flood, gathering
their ground of doubting from Genesis 9. 13. I do set my Bow in the cloud, and it
shall be for a token of a Covenant between me and the earth. Hereunto I answer,
That these words do not seem to make out any thing else, but that God did
assume the Bow for a sign, rather implying that the Heavens had been disposed
to the susception of Rainbows from the Creation: For even then were the Heavens
filled up with clouds fit for the reflection of such a light.

That a Morning Rainbow does portend wet, and an Evening one fair weather is
vulgarly reported, which nevertheless is very uncertain: For the most part it
either does precede rain or follow it; The reason is, because the forementioned
gradual declination and incrassation does cause a rain. Rain is the decidence
of clouds in drops. Clouds although incrassated and condensed, gathered and
compressed by the ambient air striving to be freed of them, yet cannot be
expelled, and protruded all at once, because their extent is too large, and
their circumference obtuse, whence they are unfit to be protruded at once,
unless they were most condensed into an acute or cutting Surface; Why they
cannot be compressed into a less compass and a greater acuteness is, because of
a great quantity of air contained within them. Touching their diruption into
drops, it is to be imputed to the external compression of the clouds, squeezing
the internal air into particles, which as they burst out do each protrude a
drop of rain: Or thus, Suppose the clouds at such times to be puffed up with
bubbles of internal air, and the diruption of each bubble to send down a drop
of rain.

Often times with rain a great wind blows down along with it, which is nothing
else but the air pent within the said clouds and bursting out of them.

A windiness does often hold up the rain, because it shatters and disperses the
parts of the said dense clouds, whereby their consistency is broken. Rains are
very frequent in the Autumn and the Winter, because the Sun casting its rays
obliquely toward those Countries, where the seasons of the year are manifestly
observed, does raise a greater abundance of vapors more than it can dissolve
or disperse; besides, a great number of clouds are sent from other places,
where the Sun does through its Summer heat raise such a great quantity of
vapors, which meeting and being impacted upon one another and etruded cause
great rains at those times of the year. The Moon has also great power in
dissolving a cloud into rain, for she sending down and impelling great
abundance of dense weighty minims does very much further the descent of drops.
Frosty minims exercise a strong virtue in stifning the air, whereby it is
rendered more firm to contain the clouds, and hinder their precipitation,
besides they do also disperse the clouds through their effective crassitude;
Whence it is, that it rains so seldom in frosty weather: But as soon as the
thou is begun likely the clouds meet and fall down in a rain; Which if
sometimes pouring down in great showers is called a Nimbus: if in small drops,
but descending close is called an Imber. The cause of this difference depends
upon the density of the clouds, and the proportion of air pent within them.

Those rainy clouds do sometimes contain a great quantity of earthy minims,
which meeting, are through a petrisick virtue changed into stones, raining down
at the dissolution of the said clouds. Other contents consisting of reddish or
whitish exhalations drawn up from the earth may give such a red or white
tincture to the clouds, which when dispersed into rain may appear bloody, or
milky.

Frog or Fish-spawns have sometimes been attracted up into the air, being
enclosed within vapors, where within the matrix of a close cloud they have
been vivified, and afterward rained down again.

A Nebula is a small thin cloud generated in the lower Region of the air out of
thin vapors: The reason, why those vapors ascended no higher, is, because
they were concreased in the lower parts of the lower Region of the air, through
the force of the air in the night, being rendered potent through the absence of
the Suns discontinuating rays.

A mist is the incrassation of vapors contained in the lowermost parts of the
air.

The dew is the decidence of drops from subtle vapors concreased through the
privative coldness of nocturnal air.

III. Snow is the decidence of clouds in flocks, whose production depends upon
the concrescence of drops by frosty minima's and their attenuation through
aerial particles, whence they are soft and do reflect the light whitish. It
usually falls after a degelation, when the congealed clouds are somewhat
loosened. It dissolves or melts through deserting the frosty minima's.

Hail is the decidence of drops in hard small quadrangular bodies: Their
congelation is also occasioned through the detention of frosty minima's within
the drops of water: Their hardness is from a less commixture of air, whence the
water does the more enjoy her own crassitude and hardness.

IV. Wind is a violent eruption of incrassated air pent within the clouds,
puffing, disrupting and taring the Element of air asunder. Hence when it blows
hard the vulgar renders it, that there is a taring wind abroad. That it is a
puffing and disruption is sensibly perceived, since the aerial Element is
divided, and being continuous it is subjected to no other violent separation of
parts but to a disruption. If so, that which does disrupt or puff up certainly
can be no other but a continuous body; Because a contiguous one would pass with
a single perforation of parts, as the rain, fire, etc. whereas a disruption and
puffing is continuous. What can this disrupting body be? It is not water; for
that would be perceived by its weight. Ergo, it must be incrassated air.

2. The air puffed is continuated unto the earth: For we feel its puffing
effects, in that we perceive it to cause a light compression or a puff upon
our faces.

3. That it is often a disruption of the air, our face and lips do testify,
being subjected to be cut and cloven in windy weather.

4. The causality of winds may not be imputed to exhalations, as Aristotle and
his Peripateticks did strangely imagine, because those are never so cohering
and continuous as to cause continuous disruptions or puffings throughout a
whole Zone. Besides exhalations according to the Philosopher are described to
be sulphurous, hot and dry: whereas black cold winds in the Winter and wet
winds in September are quite opposite, and have no sign of sulphur or heat.
Winds according to the forementioned supposition should be most frequent and
highest in the torrid Zone, and that when the Sun is in the AEquinox, which
falls out quite contrary.

Lastly, Who would be so simple as to conceive, that such a vast proportion of
exhalations should be excited as to continuate wind a whole half year or longer
together, as Monzones, provincial, and Etesian winds, etc? Neither are winds
generated out of vapors, as most do now adays believe; Because then all winds
would be moist, whereas most winds are drying. Neither will the grosseness of
vapors permit themselves to pass with such a fury, violence and
incomprehensible swiftness, Ergo nothing but air a little incrassated can
quadrate to the subtility, fierceness, swiftness, and long continuation of
winds. The manner of their generation is thus.

In the clouds (being as I said before water incorporated with air) each
Element striveth for the Center within them, viz. The air by sinking down, and
water by pressing downwards: Air having the advantage (if enclosed in a great
proportion) through its tenuity recovers the central parts; water unites in
continuation all about, the air now being slipped away; but the air without,
sinking all about upon the besieging water, especially from above (because the
whole Element of air sinks downwards) adds no small force to its pressure,
whereby it is enabled to squeeze out the enclosed air (being somewhat
incrassated, and thence rendered unlike to the ambient air; for otherways they
would unite, and so its force would be stayed,) with a violence into the
extrinsick air Add hereunto the rarefying beams of the Sun, intending the force
of the internal air toward the circumference, in the same manner as you shall
read it to be intended within the Earth in the next Chapter.
, through which it taires it to some extent, and afterward puffs it up
further, not unlike to the wind squeezed out of bellows, or a bladder. A Fan
raises a wind by puffing the air. An AEolipile does evidently confirm to us the
foresaid discourse of generation of winds: I shall first describe it, then
subnect the manner of using of it.

An AEolipile is a hollovv ball made of Brass (or any other matter that may
resist the fire) whereinto a little hole is pierced. This laid to the fire and
heated is cast into a bowl of water, of which it draws in some part: This done,
the hole is to be stopped very close, and the ball afterward laid to the fire
until it grows hot, then unstop it, and it will emit a durable wind,
considering the proportion of the water; for a half quarter of a pint of water
will suffice to maintain a wind for an hour long. This instance tells us, that
wind is nothing else but air incrassated, or a little water attenuated by much
air, squeezed out by the compression of the extrinsick air entering with the
fire through the Pores of the Ball.

The difference between the eruption of incrassated air detruding rain, and
that which causes winds, is that the former is much thicker than the latter,
less in proportion, and more dispersed in particles between the thick and dense
clouds; the latter is less incrassated, more in proportion and cohering. Air
incrassated and vapors differ in consistency Secundum magis and minus.

V. The differences of winds are taken either from their duration and type,
whence they are said to continue long or short, to be typical or erratick. The
former are again distinguished into Trade winds, Provincial winds, Etesian
winds, Land winds, and General winds.

Trade winds or Monzons are winds blowing one way for six months together, and
another way the other six months. They are called Trade winds, because they
serve to carry Ships up to and fro the Indian Coasts for to trade, or to make
trading voyages, as they are usually termed: They ordinarily meet with them in
the Channel of Mozambique in the month of August, whence they make their voyage
to Goa, Cochin or other places of the East Indies in thirty days; In March and
April the wind begins to serve them to return from the Indies to the said
Channel.

Provincial winds are such as do particularly perstate a Country and do not
exceed beyond the length of it. Thus the West-Northwest wind, according to
Seneca his relation, lib. 5. not. quaest. cap. 17. is proper to Calabria,
Tataegis to Pamphylia, Atabulus to Apulia, North Northwest to Narbone in
France, West Northwest to Athens, a West wind to this Island for the greater
part of the year; an East wind to Portugal during the Summer, etc. To these
common winds are opposites, such as perslate a whole Zone or Climate at any
time of the year.

Annual winds are such, as do return at certain times of the year, and last for
a certain term of days. These are observed to be three.

1. The Ornithean, (so called from birds) or Chelidonian (from Swallows) or
Rose winds are westerly winds, which usually begin to blow (but calmly) at the
first appearance of certain birds, as Storkes or Swallows, or the budding of
Roses.

2. (...), or forerunners are North Northwest winds blowing for the space of
eight days before the appearance of the Dog Star. They are called forerunners,
because they precede the Etesian winds.

3. The Etesian or annual winds (derived from (...) a year) are North Northwest
winds blowing forty days every year, beginning two days after the appearance
of the Dog Star: They usually rise about three a clock in the day, and are laid
again at night.

Land winds are such, as blow from the land at a certain season of the day or
night, and are opposite to those that blow from the Sea: They are otherwise by
the Portugeses named Terreinhos, as those from the Seaward Viracons. They meet
with both upon the Coasts of Guiny, Congo and Coramandel. General winds are
those, that blow one way throughout the greater part of the year; Thus off the
Cape of Good Hope a Southerly wind is general, and thence Westward toward
Brasil between 28 and 8 degrees. South Lat. a South Southeast and Southeast wind is
general. To these you may add the fiery winds, which the Spaniards call
Bochornos, derived from Boca de Horno, i. e. the hot steam of an Oven. Common
winds are distinguished into Cardinal and collateral winds.

The former are such as blow from the principal corners of the world, viz.
East, blowing from the rising of the AEquinoctial; West, blowing from the going
down of the Equator; North, erupting from the arctick Pole; and South,
deriving from the Meridies.

The latter are such as erupt from those parts of the Horizon, that are
interposed between the four principal corners, their number is 32, viz. Next to
East toward the South you have East and by South, East Southeast, Southeast
and by East, Southeast, Southeast and by South, South Southeast, South and by
East. Between South and West are inserted South and by West, South Southwest,
Southwest and by South, Southwest, Southwest and by West, West Southwest, West
and by South. From West to North are accounted West and by North, West
Northwest, Northwest and by West, Northwest, Northwest and by North, North
Northwest, North and by West. Between North and East do blow North and by East,
North Northeast, Northeast and by North, Northeast, Northeast and by East, East
Northeast, East and by North. Among these collaterals the Northeast, Northwest,
Southeast, and Southwest are termed principal collateral winds.

From their temperature winds are distinguished into cold and dry, as the
Northern and Western winds, above all the North Northeast in the Winter; or in
warm and moist winds, viz. The Southern and Easterly winds, and beyond the
others the South Southeast in the Summer. A west Southwest wind is for the most
part moist, damp, rainy, cloudy, and sometimes tempestuous. North Northwest
winds are stormy, cold, bringing often Snow and Hail along with them. A South
wind is unwholesome, putrid, pestilential, rainy, hot in the Summer, raising
thunder and lightning, and makes a thick cloudy sky. The South Southwest wind
in the Summer is temperate and warm, moist, and sometimes a concomitant to
thunder. The South Southeast wind is moist and warm.

Touching the wholsomness of winds, those that are of a warm and dry
temperature are the wholsomest and the pleasantest, because they attenuate,
clarify, and rarefie the air, disposing it to the ventilation and quickening of
our vital and animal spirits. Next to these cold and dry winds are the
wholsomest, because they purge and serenate the air, descend from a pure and
clear corner, void of all putrid and pestilential vapors. Next, those that are
simply cool or warm come into plea.

All moist winds are feverish, putrid, and sometimes pestilential, causing
catarrhes and rheumes, stirring all the excrementitious humors in the body.
Very cold winds are better than the next foregoing, yet do often cause a
constipation of the pores and of the belly: But let us take in the opinion of
Hippocrates upon winds, lib. 3. Apho. 17. Now what concerns the daily winds,
the North Northeast ones do render bodies solid and firm, and fit for motion,
and well colored. They sharpen the hearing, but yet they dry the guts,
moreover they bite the eyes. And if any one has been troubled before with a
pain in his breast, they make it sharper. But the Southern ones do quite
dissolve bodies, and render them moister, besides they occasion dullness of
hearing, and heaviness of the head and darkish meagrims, moreover they cause a
difficulty of motion both to the eyes and to the whole body, and do moisten the
guts.

Winds do also vary much in wholsomness according to the Climates or places
which they pass through: For if they are infected with putrid vapors and
exhalations arising from dead carkaffes after a field battle, stinking caves,
corrupted pooles, etc. their remperament is soon changed, although blowing from
the East or North.

Winds blow equally or unequally, continuately or interrupted, high, stormy,
or a moderate gale, or a small brife.

Some winds rise in the day and are laid again or decrease at night, as the
North winds: Others are laid in the day and rise in the night, as the South
winds. The North winds reign on the Land, the South at Sea. Now concerning
their causes.

Trade winds are generated out of eruptions of incrassated air, bursting
through even and continuated clouds, situated in the middle, or at least the
upper part of the inferior region of the air; for only there clouds are
diducted in continuation, out of whose various spouts the winds are continuated
for six months: viz. Out of the North, North Northeast or Northeast side of the
clouds of the South Hemisphere blowing to the North, North Northwest, or
Northwest, whilst the Sun is passing through the North from Aries to Libra; and
out of the South, South Southwest, or Southwest side of the clouds of the North
Hemisphere, blowing to the South, South Southeast, or Southeast, whillt the Sun
is measuring that tract from Libra to Aries through the South. The cause of the
copious elevation of vapors uniting into clouds in the South Hemisphere during
the Suns peragration through the North must be imputed to the Suns oblique
rays raising a vast measure of vapors out of the Oriental and Occidental
Ocean, which excited are beyond the sphere of the Suns direct rays, whereby
they might otherwise be dissolved.

2. Or because they are most apt to be gathered and concreased in a Region that
is privatively cold, through the continuation of the air forcing the vapors
more potently together. So likewise the Sun conversing in the Northern
declination of the Ecliptic occasions ventous clouds in the South Hemisphere
through the same efficiency.

Next we shall tell you why, the Sun existing in the North declination of the
Ecliptic, the winds burst out from the South.

1. Namely, because that side of the clouds, which is obverted to the Sun, is
discontinuated by the Suns rarefaction, or fiery minims demitted from him.

2. Because the air is strongest in its compression from the Polar side, as
being less discontinuated by the fiery minims, and enforced by the cold minims
from the pole wards. Likewise for the same reason the winds burst out from the
North, when the Sun is seated in the opposite Hemisphere.

This is observable in those Monzons, that near the AEquinoxes they blow but
little or not at all, because the Sun through its burning rays, which he
spreads, when he is perpendiculan over the middle of the torrid Zone does so
much rarifie the air, that it is rendered unfit for the concretion of clouds:
But the further the Sun declines, the more high and strong those winds grow,
and are at their strongest, when the Sun is near his remotest declination,
because through his greater remoteness the air is aptest for concretion.

2. Those winds blow stronger in the night than in the day: Because the
internal air of the clouds is then strongest squeezed and least dispersed
through the Suns heat.

3. The Monzones that blow from the South blow usually stronger, and somewhat
longer than the others, because the Sun being then got into the arctick
declination is now obliquely imminent upon the waters, and therefore raises the
greater quantity of vapors: Whereas on the other side a greater part of its
oblique rays are taken up by the Land.

4. They are often intended by the Moons demission of weighty minima's upon them.

The common winds are deprehended in the temperate and rigid Zones.

The East winds blow, when a cloud opens at its West side in the East; the
North wind blows, when it is vented at the South side in the North, etc. The
winds, if any thing durable must spout out of great long clouds, otherwise they
would soon be emptied, besides clouds through the commotion of the air do
succeed one another, and are united, when the former is sucked out as it were.
Sometimes the vvind seems to come down from over our heads, because a cloud is
opened there: More frequently from the finitor, because clouds do most usually
meet in union thereabout. Sometimes the vvindes blovv from the North and South
at once, because two clouds in those Regions are a venting. Sometimes besides
the continuation of a durable vvind, there breaks out suddenly another vvind
upon us by a blast; because there is a cloud breaks out underneath those great
ones, that cause the durable vvind.

Provincial winds are occasioned through bursting out of those clouds, that
surround the respective Provinces. For example, If a Country is apt to be most
beset with clouds on its North sides, then Northerly winds will prove its
Provincials.

Annual winds are caused through the particular aspects of the Sun at such a
time of the year, raising vapors toward such a plage or corner, and
rarefying their clouds at such a side. Winds accidentally and violently are
most of them cool and dry, because bursting out with a force, they must
necessarily cause a compression upon objected bodies, and through their tenuity
must rub off the dampness from the same bodies: Yet some winds prove more
particularly very cold and dry, because many earthy minims, that are
incorporated with the imprisoned air, break forth along with them, causing a
strong punctual compression or acute cold: Hence North winds happen to partake
so much of coldness, because they are incorporated with many terrestrial
minima's transmitted from the Polars. North Northeast winds in winter feel very
pinching and nipping cold, yea numming, because of the commixture of frosty
minims with their air. South winds are moist, because their production depends
upon clouds transmitted from the Meridies, whose body is very damp and
waterish; they are hot besides, because they have been smitten with the Suns
torrid rays. These are noxious and pernicious, because through their warm
moisture communicated to the ambient air they move, relaxe, swell, and dissolve
all the humors of the body, whence there must necessarily arise an exestuation
or fermentation of the blood.

By the way let me tell you the reason, why many clouds move against the stream
of the air: Because their winds bursting on the contrary side draw them, like
fire bursting out of a squib draws the same after it.

Winds blow equally through their equal eruption, high through their greater
union and force directed outward, and being augmented by the violent detention
of the ambient cloud. Some winds rise in the night, because the internal breath
of their clouds is now united through a privative and positive coldness. Others
are intended by the help of the dissolving Sun; for the cloud being too close
outwardly, and the inward breath not very strong, needed the rarefaction of the
Sun. Hence Northern winds are raised in the day, because the faces of the
clouds are objected directly against the heat of the Sun: Whereas South winds
are laid in the day, because the Sun rarefying the back parts of their clouds
attracts their breath backwards, and disperseth it.

Tempestuous winds are distinguished by five names.

1. Ecnephias, (from (...), out of the clouds) or an Oricane, which is a sudden
and most impetuous wind bursting out directly from above out of the sky, and
breaking in upon the Sea and Ships, cause it to rise into mountainous waves,
and these often to be overset, if their sails be up; wherefore Mariners in the
East These are very frequent off the Cape de bona Esper. where Sailers term
them Travadas.
and West Indian Ocean as soon as they spy a small cloud in the heavens
seemingly not much bigger than the top of ones hat, take in their Sails
immediately, or if at anchor they are forced to cut their Cables and expose
themselves to the free waves of the Sea for to prevent foundring. The cause of
so sudden a fury is questionless a great quantity of incrassated air, admitted
to condensed fire, pent in hard within the stiff clouds, and so setting force
against force, the air and condensed fire are forced with one violence to break
through the thick clouds, which although strongly striving to keep themselves
in continuation, yet at last choose to give way, and to suffer some parts of
them to be gathered into a small cloud, whereupon that furious AEolus soon puts
the whole Climate into a commotion, scattering withal a spout of hot water,
kindled through the great sight, rotting whatever it touches, especially woollen
clothes, and breeding worms.

2. Turbo, Typhon, (from (...), to beat) or a violent whirlwind is caused
through the same condensed fire and incrassated air violently bursting out of
several spouts, whose circular refraction meeting upon the Surface of the water
or land, often carries a Ship sheer out of the water, or any other moveable
bodies from the land. I have often been told of Ships, that have been lifted out
of the water and cast upon the shore by such winds as these Namely, off the
short of Cuba and Hispaniola.
, but how true I know not, although it seems probable enough.

3. Praester, from (...), I kindle, is a surious wind caused through the
violent eruption of exhalations, or a condensed fire kindled within the clouds,
and incrassated air, which does not only ruinate houses and trees, but often
burns them down to the ground, and puts the Sea into a boiling heat.

4. Exhydria is a vehement bursting out of wind attended with a great shower of
rain and hail. But none of these violent winds prove lasting, because the
flatuosity contained within the clouds, erupting in so great a measure, must
soon be exhausted, whereas were it evacuated in a less proportion, they must
necessarily prove more durable.

Among all the winds none delights more in the greatest and longest furies and
storms, than the South Southwest in the winter, because it derives from the
Meridies, or torrid Zone, where vapors are drawn up in very great measures,
and that constantly, because of the Suns continual torrid beams, and the
multitude of waters underneath. It is reported, that in the Northern Countries
winds are sometimes so furious, that they cast horse and man down to the
ground; and in Tartary the winds blow so violently, though in the Summer, that
there is no traveling at such times. Likewise about China and Japan tempests
are out ragious beyond belief. Tercera one of the Azores or Flemish Islands,
suffers such violences from winds, that the bars of Iron that are fastened to
the houses, although of the thickness of an arm or two, are grinded away to the
smalness of wier, and holes are eaten into the Rocks about the said Island of
the bigness of a horse through such tempestuous winds.

5. Statarian winds rage commonly every Friday in the Indies, insomuch that
Ships are provided with an Anchor more on that day; on the Sunday it grows
calm again.

It will not be amiss to add the cause of the variation of winds perceived by
Ships that are in sight of one another, and why the wind at Sea differs often a
point or two from the wind at Land: viz. Because the wind bursting out low does
reflect against the tumor of the Sea interjected between the two ships, or
against the Promontories and Hills of the Lands reflecting the wind, some
larger, others narrower. The Seas grow often very turbulent and incensed:

1. Through the eruption of winds descending from above and piercing through
their body, which they raise into high waves by their swelling, and strife of
passing.

2. The said winds do raise other winds and flatuosities within the body of
waters, partly out of their own substance, and partly out of their mud. The Sea
is much more disposed to disturbations in some places than others: As off the
Cape of Good Hope, likewise between China and Japan, where Seamen often are
forced to pawn their ships and lives to the Ocean.

CHAP. XVI. Of Earthquakes, together with their Effects, and some strange
instances of them.
1. What an Earthquake is. The manner of its generation. The Coucomitants
thereof. 2. The kinds and differences of Earthquakes. 3. The proof of the
generation of Earthquakes. 4. Their Effects upon the air.


I. SInce we have lately discoursed upon eruptions of incrassated air out of
the clouds, we shall next insert a few words touching the eruption of
incrassated air out of the Earth, whose egress causes that, which we call an
Earthquake, and is nothing else but the trembling of the earth, ordinarily
following or preceding the bursting thereof, through subterraneous winds vio
ently breaking forth. The manner of its production is thus: A proportion of air
and water being lodged in a Cavern underground is further attenuated into
subterraneous clouds, thence into vapors, and thence into incrassated air
through fiery minims entering and penetrating through the pores of the Earth,
whereupon the earth pressing strongly suffers a diruption, in the same manner,
as we see a bottle filled with water being close stopped and exposed to the fire
is broke through the force of incrassated air, or attenuated and rarefied water
within. Whence we observe these concomitants to be necessary in an Earthquake.
1. A strange great noise. 2. A trembling of the Earth. 3. A great blast. 4. A
spouting out of water. 5. Sometimes an unequal discontinuation and excavation
of the Earth. 6. Sometimes a flame.

II. The kinds of Earthquakes are taken,

1. from their effects and manner of motion; some causing a shaking or quaking
of the earth, (named by some an Inclination, by Aristotle a Tremor,) through
which houses, walls, or other buildings are weakened in their foundation, and
thence are occasioned to fall down; thus many Cities of Asia, in the fifth year
of Tiberius, of Bithynia near the extreme passion of our Savior; the City
Nyssena, Bale, and particularly Ferrarae a City in Italy were demolished: this
last was surprised on Martins day in the year 1570, beginning about ten a clock
at night with most terrible sounds, as if the City had been battered with great
pieces of Ordnance; next a very horrible shaking or trembling followed, raising
all the Citizens out of their beds, putting them to their beads, pouring out
their prayers thrice louder than ordinary, and forcing them to quit the City
and to behold the ruin of their houses in the fields; The Palace of the Duke
and other great buildings yielded to this violence; many were frighted out of
their lives, others killed through these prodigious accidents, not ceasing
before the next day at night. No less were the Citizens of Constantinople
amazed by those most raging Earthquakes, in nothing less terrible than the
former, described by Agath. lib. 5. de la guerre Gothique; The strange kinds of
noises, sounds, thunder, whistling, howling, cracking, that were then
perceived, are incredible. Campania in the time of the Consulship of L.
Cornelius and Q. Minutius, was infested with a trembling for many days
together. Many do write of such Earthquakes as these, that lasted a month, a
year, some two years, but by fits I suppose. In Parthia above two thousand
Villages have been demolished by Earthquakes; besides many others in Sicily in
the 16th year of Charles the fifth, in the month of April; In October of the
18th year of his Reign another happened near Puteoli in Campania. Others have
been observed only to cause a single elevation or puffing up of the Earth,
afterward sinking down again without the appearance of any other violence, and
are by Aristotle named Pulses. By these the earth and houses upon it have been
lifted up to a great height, and sunk down again without the displacing of one
single stone: Thus the houses of a Town in Switzerland called Friburg were
twice at several times lifted up in the year 1509, once in the night, the other
time in the day. By the same accident some houses about Bordeaux, in the year
1545, in the month of August were lifted up, and sunk down again into their
former places. Others cause a bursting and excavation of the earth, swallowing
up its whole Surface where it bursted, with the Houses, Men, and Cattle upon
it; as when a part of the Island Lango or Coos (famous for being the Country of
Hippocrates) was swallowed up, at which time the Inhabitants were not a little
amazed by an incredible thunder and fury of its commotion. Camden gives a
relation of a very stupendous Earthquake, that befell the east part of
Herefordshire in the year 1575 in March, where the earth and a rocky hill
(called Marcley hill) was removed to a far distance thence with the Trees and
all the Sheep that were upon it. Some other Trees were cast out of the ground,
whereof many fell flat upon the ground, others happened to fall into the seams of
the Hill, and closed as fast, as if they had taken their first root there. The
hole which this eruption made was at least 40 foot wide, and 80 yards long,
lasting from Saturday in the Evening until Monday at noon. Likewise a whole
Town was swallowed up in the Island AEnaria, another in Thrace, one in
Phaeuicia beyond Sidon, and another in Eubaea. Others protrude a great piece of
earth and cast it up into a kind of mountain, but a very uneven one, as for
instance the mount Modernus near the Lake Avernus: This sort is called
Egestion. Some cast forth a flame withal, as happened in the Mount Vesevus,
alias the Mount of Somma in Campania, and the Mongibell in Sicily. Earthquakes
have sometimes removed two opposite fields and placed them in one another
room, as those two fields in Italy where the Marrucini were seated in the Reign
of Nero. For Rivers to burst out, as the River Ladon in Arcadia did; and others
to be stopped up by earth cast into them by such accidents is very possible. Often
times Earthquakes make way for Deluges, which may be also incident upon the
earth at the bottom of the Sea or near to the shore; or may happen to the same
places without a deluge, whereby the waters have been swallowed up and Ships
left dry upon the shore; as that which happened in the time of Theodosius; or
that when M. Antonius and P. Dolabella were Consuls, leaving great heaps of
fish dry upon the sands. In the Reign of Emanuel there was a very great
Earthquake perceived about Lisbon, Scalabis, and other Towns of Portugal,
whereby the waters of the River Tajo were so much diffused, that the bottom
appeared dry. There is another kind of Earthquake called Arietation, when two
subterraneous winds vibrate against one another: Sometimes this happened
without any damage, there being some earth betvveen to hinder their conflict;
other times meeting in cavernous places have subverted mountains and all that
was upon them; as those mountains near Modena, which Pliny, lib. 2. Cap. 83.
relates to have been bursted against one another with a very hideous noise,
subverting many Villages, and swallowing up a number of Cattle; yea whole
Countries and Armies have been devoured by these kinds of accidents.

2. From their duration, some lasting a day, a week, a month, etc.

3. From their violence some inferring little or no damage, others being
contented with nothing less than ruin.

4. From the sounds that accompany them, being various, as I have related
before.

5. From their places: Some more frequently infesting Islands, others the
Continent: Thus Sicily, AEnaria, Lucara, the Moluccas Islands, Tyrus, Eubaea,
Phrygia, Caria, Lydia, Italy, and many Countries in the West Indies have very
often been molested by Earthquakes. Cold Countries, as the Septentrional ones, or
others that are very hot, as Egypt, are very seldom invaded by them.

6. From their efficient, some being extraordinarily raised by the Almighty out
of his wrath for to punish the sons of men for their sins; an instance of this
we have in 2 Kings 22. Likewise that, which happened about the time of the
Passion of Christ, supposed by many, as Didymus, and others, to have been
universal, and to have shaken the whole Earth; but since Ecclesiastic
Historians make no mention of it, none is bound to give credit to the foresaid
Supposition: However beyond all dispute it was a very great one, if not the
greatest that ever the earth underwent. Neither is Paulus Oros, to be thought
more authentic, relating lib. 7. hist. Cap. 32. an universal Earthquake in the
time of Valentinianus, since the holy Scripture and Reason do tell us, that the
Earth is altogether immovable.

7. From the consequents, viz. Some after the earths eruptions are followed by
vehement winds, emptying out of her; others by hot boiling waters; others again
by damps and stinking sents; also by vomiting up of stones, clots of earth and
other strange bodies.

8. From their extent, some reaching farther, others nearer: Thus there happened
an Earthquake in the year 1577, on the 18th day of September, that began from
Colmar in Switzerland, and reached as far as Bern, being near upon 60 miles
distant, etc.

III. Now it is requisite, I should proffer proof for the forementioned causes
of Earthquakes.

1. I prove that they are caused by winds; because they alone are of a capable
force to burst out suddenly through the earth.

2. Because winds bursting out of the earth do always precede and consecute
Earthquakes; whence we may certainly collect, when waters in Pits and Rivers
begin to be turgid and continually raised into a great number of bubbles, that
an Earthquake is near at hand, as appeared by the swelling and bubling of the
River Po a little before the before alleged harthquake of Ferrara.

2. That these winds are principally raised out of peregrin water collected
within a Cavern of the earth is evident by the great spouting out of water,
that does follow the eruption.

3. It is further made evident in a bottle half filled with water and exposed
to the fire, which does also make good to us, that the Sun through its fiery
minims does press in a great proportion of air into those subterraneous waters,
whereby they are attenuated; whence those waters, that are cast forth presently
after the diruption, are also rendered boiling hot; so that Countries remote
from the energy of the Sun are seated beyond danger of having winds generated
within their bowels; however subterraneous fires may supply the office of the
Suns beams in attenuating the waters into winds by impelling air into them,
whence it is that near the mount Hecla in Iseland concussions and arietations
happen frequently.

Earthquakes are disposed to eruption in the night season as much as in the
day; because as the erupting force of the internal winds is intended by the
Suns rarefaction, so is the compressing virtue of the Earth intensed by the
more potent sinking down of the air in the night, being freed from the
discontinuating fiery minims, and by the decidence of the weighty minims
inherent in the Air.

The Spring and Autumn are Seasons of the year qualified for the attenuating
and rarefying of the peregrin waters, whence also they prove most frequent near
those times. Why Hills and hilly Countries are subject to tremors and
concussions, and other moist ones, as Holland and Zealand, less, may easily be
understood from our discourse upon the generation of Hills.

IV. That Earthquakes portend Famine, Pestilential Fevers, and other
contagious diseases is believed by most Grave Authors, but whence such a
putrefaction causing the said distempers should arrive to the air cannot well
be deduced from their assigning exhalations to be the causes of Earthquakes,
since they hold them to be hot and dry, being qualities according to the
Peripateticks resisting and expelling putrefaction beyond any; wherefore it
will be most agreeable to hold with us, that it is derived from those moist
damps and vapors, that are the material causes of the disrupting winds.

CHAP. XVII. Of fiery Meteors in the Air.
1. Of the generation of a Fools fire, a Licking fire, Helens fire, Pollux and
Castor, a Flying Drake, a burning Candle, a perpendicular fire, a skipping
Goat, flying sparks, and a burning flame. 2. Of the generation of Thunder,
Fulguration and Fulmination, and of their effects. Of a thunder stone. 3. Of
Comets. Of their production.


I. THose vapors, that are elevated into the air, often contain no small
proportion of sulphurous particles within them, which if concreasing through
their own positive coldness, and privative coldness of the night, into a low
cloud (Nebula) in the lowermost parts of the lower Region, do compress those
sulphurous particles (otherwise termed exhalations, and distinguished from
vapors, because in these water and air are predominant, in the others
condensed fire and incrassated air) toward the Center, where uniting are
converted into a flame by extending the incrassated air through their condensed
fire. This flame possibly appears like unto a Candle, playing and moving to and
fro the air, and thence is also called a fools fire, or Ignis Fatuus, seu
erraticus, because it proves sometimes an occasion of leading Travelers that
are belated out of their Road; for by their coming near to it the air is
propelled, which again protrudes the flame forwards, and so by continuing to
follow it, imagining the same to be some Candle in a Town or Village, are often
misled into a ditch or hole: Or if they go from it, when they are once come
near, the light will follow them, because in receding, they make a cavity,
which the next succeeding air accurs to fill up. The generation of these lights
is more frequent near muddy Pools, Churchyards, and other putrid places, that
abound with such sulphurous bodies. The said sulphurous parts, if being of a
less density, condensed and united by the dense wool of a man's clothes, or
hair, or the hairs of a Horse or Ox and the foresaid coldnesses, it takes fire
at the forementioned places, but flames so subtly, that it is incapable of
burning: This sort of Meteor is called an Ignis lambens, a licking fire,
because it slakes then here then there, like to spirits of Wine flaming. Helens
fire (sidus Helenae) so called, because as Helen occasioned the ruin of Greece
and Asia, so this kind of flaming fire, adhering to the shrowds or Yards of a
Ship, is usually a messenger of the Ships perishing. If this flame appears
double, it is distinguished by a double name of Castor and Pollux, which are
generally construed to bring good tidings of fair weather. But these kinds of
prognostications are very uncertain: They may precede storms, and may appear
without the consequence of tempests: For there is no necessity for either. This
generation depends upon exhalations condensed and united between the Ropes and
the Masts, or the Yards. A flying Drake (Draco volans) is a flame appearing by
night in the lowest Region of the air with a broad belly a small head and tail
like unto a Drake: Its matter is the same with the former, differing in
quantity alone and figure, so framed through the figure of its containing cloud.

In the upper part of the lower Region of the air are produced,

1. A falling Star, representing a Star falling down from the Heavens. 2. A
burning Lance, expressing the Image of a flaming Lance. 3. A burning Candle
(fax.) 4. A Perpendicular fire, or fiery pillar, (trabs seu ignis
perpendicularis, seu pyramid) representing a flaming beam, or pillar. 5. A
flaming Arrow (bolis.) 6. A skipping Goat (Caprasaltans) is a flame more long
than broad, glistering, and flaking about its sides, and variously agitated in
the air like the skipping of a Goat. 7. Flying sparks, moving through the air
like the sparks of a Furnace. 8. Flamma ardens seu stipulae ardentes, or a
great burning fire, suddenly flaming in the air like those fires, that are
kindled out of a great heap of straw.
All these depend upon a grosser material cause, being somewhat more condensed
and united than the former, through a greater privative coldness, and therefore
they are also more durable. A falling Star obtains its production near the
permanent clouds, and being somewhat weighty through earthy minims, and
rarefying the air through its heat breaks through Or rather is detruded.
and falls down lower, until it is arrived to a thicker cloud, where
nevertheless it does not abide long in its flame. The others procure their
figure from their proportion of mixture, and shape of the ambient cloud.

II. Thunder is a great rebounding noise in the air, caused through the violent
bursting out of incrassated air and condensed fire, being suddenly kindled into
a flame Like Gun powder suddenly taking fire, and causing a violent noise, when
discharged out of a gun, or any other close hollow body.
; the manner and cause of this eruption you may easily collect from the manner
of the eruption of winds. How a sound is produced I have set down before. The
differences of Thunders are various: Some are only murmuring without a
multiplication of sounds, caused through a less proportion of fire and air,
bursting through a less dense and thick cloud. Others raise a great cracking
noise, happening through the acuteness of the sound, smartly dividing the air and
clouds, wherever it reaches. Lastly, some are great hollow sounds variously
multiplied, happening through the reflection and refraction of other dense and
thick clouds driving in the way. Besides these there might be accounted many
more differences of Thunders, raised through the proportion of air and fire
that burst out, and the various mixtures of clouds.

Fulguration or a flashing is fire condensed, raised into a flame through
incrassated air within a cloud, and breaking out from it. This scarce effects
any great noise, because of its subtility, although in some it does.

Fulmination or Lightning differs from the former only in intention, in that it
is much more forcible, reaching to the ground, and piercing into it and other
terrestrial thick dense bodies, and is more augmented in matter. It is
ordinarily a concomitant of Thunder, both being produced at once, although not
perceived by us together, we seeing the Lightning before we hear the Thunder,
because a visible object is much swifter communicated to the eye than a sound
to the ear, as appears in spying a man a far off chopping of wood, we seeing
His Axe go down before we hear the noise; the reason of this I have inserted
above. A Lightning is either vibrating, and is next to Fulguration in
intention, passing more subtly: Or discutient, consisting somewhat of a
denser fire, and causing a greater Thunder. 3. Or burning, consisting of the
densest fire, causing the greatest Thunder, and often melting a Sword in the
Scabberd or Moneys in a Bag, and the Scabberd and Bag remaining undamaged: The
reason is, because the rarity of these gave a free passage to the Lightning,
whereas the crassitude and density of the others did stay and unite the passing
aduting flame. Strong men and beasts are often killed through an aduring
Lightning, whereas women and children do escape; because the bodies of these
latter being laxe and porous suffer the said flame to pass without any great
resistance, whereas the crassitude of the other bodies do unite and collect it,
through which their vital heat is quite dispersed, having no other apparent
sign either within or without their bodies of so sudden an alteration. Wolfgang
Meverer, in his Com. Meteor. p. 140. makes mention of a man being suddenly
seized upon on the way between Leipsich and Torga, and lifted up into the skies
by a lightning, never appearing again to any; Wine has sometimes been bound up
together with a thin skin through the like accident, the cask being broke
asunder: This doubtless depended upon the incrassation and condensation of the
external parts of the Wine, through the compressing force of the Lightning,
impelling the aerial and igneous parts to the Center. Wine thus affected
becomes very noxious and poisonous through the infection of the Celestial
sulphur.

I must not forget to insert a word or two touching Thunder stones, differing
in hardness and figure, some being Pyramidal, others Globous, Oval, or like to
a wedge, etc. Touching their generation Authors are much at variance. Sennert.
opiniates, that they are generated upon the Earth, through the great heat of
the Lightning melting, and afterward concreasing the sands into a very hard
stone. A gross mistake:

1. These stones are observed to fall down from the Heavens after a thunder
with such an acute pressing weight, that they are forced (according to Pliny,
lib. 2. c. 55.) five foot deep into the earth, according to others 9 yards, and
some would have them press to the Center of the Earth, but that is ridiculous.

2. A stone of that hardness is not generated in so short a time.

3. These stones must then be supposed to be generated without a matrix. But to
the matter: They are generated within very dense and thick clouds, whose denser
and thicker part is sequestered into a closer seat for a womb, where after some
time it concreases into a stone: And lastly its greatest hardness is
accomplished through the intense heat of the fire united within the same clouds,
and happens to fall down through the great concussion and disruption caused by
a Thunder.

III. To these Igneous Meteors a Comet is likewise to be referred, touching
whose seat and production a deal of dispute is made: But before I direct my Pen
to those particulars, it will not be amiss first to set down its description: A
Comet or blazing Star is a fiery Meteor (that is a mixed body of no long
duration sublimed into the air,) generated out of some dense fiery and thick
airy parts contained within the clouds of the second region of the air. It
chooses a difference from its figure, color, time, motion, duration and place,
whence some are globous, beset round with fiery hairs, and therefore are called
Cometae criniti: Or others seem to be barded; whence they, are termed Cometae
barbati: Or others again appear with a tail, and for that reason are named
Cometae caudati. Some appear in a light golden or yellow flame, others redish,
bloody, dusky, red, etc. Some are moved slowly, others swiftly, some are moved
more regularly than others. Some appear in the Spring, others more frequently
in the Autumn, rarely in the Summer, more rarely in the Winter: Some are of a
weekly, or monthly duration, others remain six months in sight. Commonly they
keep their station without the tropicks, and but rarely some do appear within
the Tropicks.

But in reference to their place of production, many believe their seat to be
in the Elementary Region, viz. The upper Region of the air, that is according
to their meaning, near the Concave of the Moon, where the actual flame of the
Stars may the better kindle them, judging the coldness of the second Region to
be very unapt for the generation of these bodies. Others again allott the
Celestial Plage for their reception: And among these Anaxagoras and Democritus
thought them to be the appearance of several Planets united in company and in
their lights. Pythagoras, asserted them to be Planets (but none of the seven
Common ones) that had remained hidden all this while under the beams of the
Sun, and through their digress from him came now into sight, in the same manner
as often befalls to Mercury. The first opinion owned by the Peripateticks does
somewhat thwart their own Tenants.

1. They asserted that the kindling of all the preceding fiery Meteors was
occasioned through the intense coldness of the air in the second Region,
effecting a violent commotion upon exhalations contained within its
jurisdiction, whereby they were inflamed or took fire, and that in the night,
because its season does superadd somewhat to the cold: Whereas here they
contradict themselves and maintain the second Region to be too cold for to
kindle a flame.

2. There they proclaim the Solar or other intense heat to discuss and
disperse the exhalations in the torrid Zone, and therefore fiery Meteors appear
seldom there; here nothing but a flaming actual heat will do it. What
inconstancies are these?

3. Can any one probably imagine, that such great heaps and mountains of
exhalations, as the great Mole of a Comet requires at that distance, should be
attracted to the highest Region of the air? It is a question, whether the whole
Earth can afford so much sulphurous matter, were it all exhausted. Or if she
could, would that intense coldness (as they imagine) of the second Region of
the air, or those thick dense clouds of the lower Region give passage to such
numerous and thick passengers? Or do you not think, that they would be sooner
discussed through the intense heat of the upper Region, than concrease into a
body? Neither can Astronomers with their Telescopes discern in them such a
propinquity to the fiery Region or Moon, but to the contrary a very great
distance. As for Democritus his opinion, it is scarce worth the time to confute
it; but let me confirm my own. I say they are generated in the second Region of
the air; not that second Region, which the Peripateticks have chalckt out, but
the middle between the lower and upper Region, where those stiff and permanent
clouds are swimming; not beginning from the tops of the mountains, but from the
tops of the Erratick clouds. The said permanent clouds move with the body of
the air from East to West, and so do the Comets Except they be descended so
low, as to find themselves seated within the upper erratick clouds.
.

2. The permanent clouds are alone capable of condensing and uniting those
subtle exhalations, that are escaped the thick dense clouds of the inferior
Region, into a compact flame, durable for a certain term of days, weeks, or
months, according to the seat of that Region, and the quantity of exhalations.
Neither is this flame apt to spend it self much, because it is (as it were)
partially catochizated through the privative coldness of the air and positive
coldness of its clouds.

2. It is supplied with pure incrassated air, not infected with many dense
terrestrial or thick waterish particles. Touching its hairs, they are nothing
else but the light of its flame illustrating or obtending the air contained
within those clouds in so many streaks; for it cannot obtend it equally all
about, because it is permixt with water, whose crassitude will not bear
obtension, wherefore it divides the water or vapors into small or narrow lanes
obtending the air between them. Now if the water or clouds are equally pliable
all about it, it appears hairy all about its Circumference; if the forepart of
the cloud be somewhat dense, and thence indisposed to give way, but resists,
and only the back-part be pliable it forms streaks backwards seeming like a
tail, and so according to the pliableness of the air it flashes out in figures.

If you are free to understand by a Comet any new appearing Star, descending
from its former seat, or lately generated, I must agree with you, that these
are only seated in the lower fiery Region, some below or above the Moon; and in
this acception I have made use of the name of Comets in some of the preceding
Chapters.

Authors in treating of Comets seldom forget the inserting their predictions,
which are 1. Storms. 2. Great drinesses. 3. Tempestuous Seas. 4. Earthquakes.
5. Great alterations to befall a Country by the death of their King or Prince.
All the former are no more frequently consequents of Comets, than of all other
fiery Meteors, because with those great stores of vapors and exhalations,
there cannot but be a great proportion of slatuosities attracted, whose
bursting out proves the efficient of the now mentioned effects. But as for the
last, there can little reason be given for it, saving only that such a
constitution of air causes commotions of humors, and thence may cause
diseases in general, but why it should light more upon such great personages
than others, is beyond all guess, and therefore the truth of it is suspicious.
Likewise the fabulous presages of other fiery Meteors may be placed in the same
rank of dubiousness.

CHAP. XVIII. Of the term Antiperistasis and a Vacuum.
1. Whether there be such a thing as an Antiperistasis. 2. Whether a Vacuum be
impossible; and why. 3. Experiments inferring a Vacuum answered. 4. Whether a
Vacuum can be effected by an Angelical, or by the Divine Power. 5. Whether
Local Motion be possible in a Vacuum. A threefold sense of the doubt proposed.
In what sense Local Motion is possible in a Vacuum, in what not.


1. I Could not conveniently without interruption of my Subject insist before
upon the examining that term of the Schools, so often assumed by them to expound
the manner of generation of the fiery Meteors, viz. Antiperistasis, being
described to be the intension of heat or cold in bodies, caused through the
cohibition, repulsion or reflection of their own virtues by their contraries,
without the addition of any new formal parts, or retention of their steams.
Thus many Wells are cool in the Summer and warm in the Winter; and exhalations
grow hotter in the cold region of the air, because of the Antiperistasis of the
ambient cold against their heat, and of their heat again against the external
cold; in effect it is nothing but the condensation (if such a term may be
improperly used) or rather union of the qualities of the Elements by the
resistance and collecting of their virtues by their opposites. But since the
collection or uniting these qualities depends upon the condensation or
incrassation of their substances, there is no need of introducing another
frustraneous notion. But suppose an Antiperistasis or intension of qualities
without the condensation of their substances were granted, how do fiery Meteors
become flames? Never a word of this. And when flames, why do they cause a
disruption of the air in a Thunder? Because (say they) of avoiding a
penetration of bodies: A good one, what fear is there of a penetration of
bodies, when there is only an intension of qualities through an Antiperistasis,
without an augmentation of bodies? Possibly they will take their refuge to a
contrary assertion, and tell me, that the foresaid disruption happens, because
of avoiding a Vacuum. This is just like them to run from one extremity to
another: But how a Vacuum? Because the flame pent close within consumes, or
has consumed or expelled its ambient air, which done, there must needs follow
a Vacuum, if Nature did not prevent it, by causing the extrinsick air to break
in, or the internal to break out for anguish. This is improbable; for the
Vacuum may be filled up by the concentration of the ambient clouds.

Since I am accidentally here fallen into the discourse of a Vacuum, I will
think it worth my labor to inquire, whether such a thing be naturally possible
within the Circumference of the Universe. I do not mean an imaginary Vacuum
without the heavens, neither a space void of any gross body, although filled up
only with air, but a place or external Surface freed from air, or any other
body. For answer, I assert a Vacuum to be repugnant to nature, because the
nature of the Elements is to move toward one another, with the greatest force
imaginable, through their respective forms, because of their own preservation:
Hence the Elements would sooner change into a confusion, than be debarred from
one minimum, without having its space filled up with another. Wherefore it is
not enough to assert (as usually they do) that there is no Vacuum possible in
Nature, because she does so much abhor it, as if Nature was an Animal sensible
of any hurt, and why does she abhor? that they know not. However some state the
cause of her abhorrence to be Natures providence, in ordering that sublunar
bodies through mediation of interposed bodies should be disposed to receive the
Celestial influences, which a Vacuum would otherwise eclipse from them? How
frivilous! As if a moments partial vacuity, (which could through its being
violent not prove lasting) should hinder a communication of the Elements, or as
if the said influences could not be transmitted to sublunars by mediation of
bodies, that limit the said supposed vacuity. Arriaga holds it to be for to
prevent a penetration of bodies: That is idem per idem; for one might as well
demand, why Nature does so much abhor a penetration of bodies, and be answered,
because of avoiding a Vacuum.

Vasquez a Jesuit is of opinion, that Nature can never attain to a Vacuum,
because every body is empowered with an attractive virtue, attracting the next
body that is contiguous to it, in such a manner that no body can be stirred,
except it attracts its next adherent with it; Oh how grossly! Does fire attract
water, or earth air? They all apprehend attraction to be violent, and
notwithstanding they affirm Nature to abhor a Vacuum naturally, and how can
this hang together?

III. Arguments for the proof of a Vacuum, many are offered, but none of any
strength, however for your satisfaction I will propose some few.

1. A Basin filled up with ashes contains as much water poured into it, as if
the same Vessel were void; ergo there must either be allowed a penetration of
bodies, or a pre-existent Vacuum: But so antiquity has found the Antecedence,
Ergo the consequence must be admitted.

I must needs assert this ancient experiment to be an ancient falsehood; for a
basin filled with ashes will scarce contain four fifths of the water, that it
will do, when it is empty: As for the water that is imbibed by the ashes, it
possesses the spaces left by the air, contained before between the particles of
the said ashes, and now thence expelled.

2. Warm water stopped close in a bottle does possess more room, than when being
set in a cold place it is concreased into an Ice: Ergo there must be some void
space left within the bottle.

I answer, That the supposed vacuity is filled up with frosty minims, whose
presence expelling the air and fire from between the Pores of the water, does
withal reduce it to a smaller body, as being before insufflated with air and
fire: But when the same frosty minims do return, then the air and fire do fill
up their vacuities again, by insufflating the body of water through their
succession.

3. An AEolipile being filled up with water and air, does notwithstanding slow
as much fire, as will cause its wind to blaze a whole hour or longer according
to the bigness of it: Ergo there must have been a Vacuum contained within the
wind bale, or else we must admit a penetration of bodies by condensation.

I answer, That neither is necessary; for the advenient fire expels so much of
the contained air as its presence does take up, and diducts the body of the
AEolipile somewhat into a larger continent, wherein a greater part of fire may
be contained than there is air expelled.

Pecquet in his Exper. Nov. Anat. has endeavored to borrow all experiments
possible for to divide the Universe with a Vacuum, and so to abolish the
Natures of the Elements. I shall only propose the first, which he has from
Monsieur Roberval, Professor of the Mathematics at Paris, and is alone
performed by a glass blown in the form of a bolts head, open below and atop at
its capacity, where it contains an empty bladder, that is usually taken out of
a Carpes belly, being tied close with a thread, as likewise the top of the
capacity with a Sows bladder: This done it is filled up to the brim of the
orifice of the neck with Mercury, which being close stopped with ones finger is
immitted into a vessel half filled with Mercury, and thrust deep into it, where
the finger is to be withdrawn: Hereupon follows the descent of the Mercury as
low as half way the Pipe, and the bladder is puffed up. Hence he deduces a Vacuum
between the rarefied parts of the air, blowing up the bladder contained within
the empty capacity. What a gross mistake is this!

First, He must know, as I shall prove by and by, that it is the air that
presses the Mercury down; for whatever is moved Locally is moved by an
extrinsick agent.

Secondly, He does against reason and experience state the rarefaction of some
air: But whence came that air? There was none, whilst it was filled up with the
Mercury; ergo it must have pierced through the pores of the Glass; If so, what
needs he admit only a small quantity, which he supposes to be rarefied after
its ingress by an elaterick virtue, since a greater may as easily pass? and why
then a Vacuum? Wherefore I say he must necessarily grant some air to pass the
pores for to blow up the bladder: besides I prove, that it is easy for the air
to pass through the pores of Glass; because we see, light does easily pass the
thickest Glass; but light is the air illuminated or obtended, as I have proved
before, ergo. That Glass is pierced through with subtle pores is evident a
little before it begins to concrease or indurate after its melting Besides
it appears plainly in a Thermometer.
Moreover we see, that the liquor it self of Aqua Fort. being poured upon the
filing of Brass, penetrates through the pores of a thick precipitating Glass:
The same is observed about the Glass at the ^ffusion of oil of Vitriol to oil
of Tartar; but air is much more subtle than these Liquors. Do we not observe
the air to press by the spurring of fire through glasses of the greatest
thickness? For expose a thick glass of water to the fire, and you may observe
it to be raised into millions of bubbles, when it begins to siethe, which is
nothing else but the air forced through the pores of the Glass by the fire: In
fine there is nothing that is imperforated by pores, except water and air in
their absolute state. I omit the rest of his borrowed experiments, and shall
only insert two words touching the conclusion, inferred from the pomping of the
air out of a large round Glass Receiver, (in that manner as you have it
proposed by Casper Scott,) which they conclude must afterward remain void; on
the contrary it is rather more filled by air, attracted from without, and
impacted so closs, that the pores of the glass seem to be filled and
insufflated with it, as appears by the venting of the Receiver so pomped into a
vessel of cold water, where it causes a very great commotion and siething by
the air bursting out; certainly this is different from pomping the Receiver
empty: or thus, they may pretend a Vacuum, because there is more air attracted
into the Receiver than it contained before; ergo there must either a
penetration of bodies be allowed, or a Vacuum. To this I need propose no other
answer for solution, than what I gave for the solution of the eruption of air
out of an AEolipile. How or in what manner air is attracted into the said
Receiver by this Magdenburg experiment, you shall read in the next Chapter. As
for other Arguments they being as vacuous as Vacuum it self I shall neglect the
mentioning of them.

IV. But the Jesuitical Philosophers do further propose to themselves, whether
a Vacuum could not be effected by an Angelical power, or if not by Angels,
whether by the Divine Power. This is as like them as if it were spit out of
their mouths: Those vile Impostors and the devils Saints will name God
Almighty, and notwithstanding to his face doubt of his power in so mean a thing
as a Vacuum is; what, if God can destroy the Elements entirely, cannot he
displace them partially? Angels I confess cannot effect it naturally and
ordinarily, although extraordinarily being virtuated with an extraordinary
power from God they may.

V. Next they rommage, whether Local Motion be possible in a Vacuum; and if it
be, whether it must not happen in an instant.

I shall not weary my self to produce their opinions, but only appose what
reason does direct me. But let us first state the question right: The Problem
may be understood in a threefold sense.

1. Whether a Local Motion be possible in a Vacuum as through a Medium, through
which a body being locally moved passes, taking its beginning of progress from
without the said Vacuum.

2. Whether a body can take its beginning of motion outward from a Vacuum.

3. Whether a spiritual substance obtains the power of moving it self locally
in a Vacuum, or through it, without taking its first impulse from against a
body, whence through reflection it might pass through.

This premitted, I answer that according to the first intention a Vacuum is
capable of giving a passage to a body locally moving through it, provided it
takes its progress from without upon an immovable center.

I prove it, Air, Fire, and the other Elements move through a Vacuum; for
otherwise did they move through another body, it would infer a penetration of
bodies: If then the Elements obtain such a power, ergo consequently their mixed
bodies.

2. This Maxim Omne mobile sit super immobili. i. e. All movables move upon an
immovable body, is alone to be understood of the foundation of motion, viz.
That all movables must move from an immovable Center, that is, take their
beginning thence, either by impulse, reflection, refraction, or continuated
protrusion.

3. That Motion, whereby a moveable passes through a Vacuum, is continuated
upon its own Center, or upon another body instead of a Center; for all motions
must take their beginning upon an immovable, or at least upon that which is
not inclined to the same motion, in the same swiftness that the body, which
moves upon it does.

4. A single body can neither press through, not move (that is out of its
place,) locally in a Vacuum, because it enjoying its Center, and not being
violently detained, would rest upon that Center.

5. Neither can a mixed body move locally, that is, change its ubi in a Vacuum,
because the reason of a bodies changing of its ubi is the impulsion of another
body, striving for its center upon it: For example, water moves upwards,
because the air striving for its Center protrudes it out of its seat upwards,
as has been mentioned; air being compressed within the body of water is moved
out of it, because of the waters compression downwards, whereby it is squeezed
upwards; But not through its own motion. Now in a Vacuum there is no external
body to strive or to impell upon it.

6. A body would not cease to move locally internally, because of the violent
detentions of the Elements contained within, pressing one another away from the
Center.

7. Suppose there were a confusion of the four Elements as big as a fist cast
without the Universe, they would change their internal places, as the Elements
changed theirs in the Chaos, viz. The weighty Elements being less in extent
would sooner gain the Center, than the others, and as for the rest they would
move in the same manner, as the Elements move here, but of this more in the
next Chapter: And now you may easily comprehend that the present world does not
at all change its Ubi, but is immoveably fixed, although continually changing
its internal places.

8. Angels, if conceited to be pure spirits may move in and through a Vacuum,
but if apprehended to be of a circumscriptive quantity, they cannot.

CHAP. XIX. Of Physical Motion.
1. What a Physical Motion is; The kinds of it; The definition of Alteration,
Local Motion, and quantitative motions. The subdivision of Local Motion. 2.
That all alterative and quantitative motions are direct. 3. That all external
motions are violent. 4. That all weighty mixed bodies, being removed from their
Element, are disposed to be detruded downwards from without; but do not move
from any internal inclination or appetite they have to their universal Center.
5. The causes of swiftness and slowness of external Local Motion. 6. That light
bodies are disposed to be moved upwards. 7. That ayry bodies, being seated in
the fiery Region, are disposed to be moved downwards.


1. THe same reason, that persuaded me to treat of a Vacuum and Antiperistasis
in the preceding Chapter, is also a motive why I deferred the Treatise of
Physical motions hither.

Physical motions are so called in opposition to Hyperphysical or Metaphysical,
and are proper to natural bodies. A Physical motion then is a change of a
natural body in any one or more of its Physical modes, or in all: A change is a
(transitus) passing from that which is not to that which is to be: Whence we
may plainly collect the differences of it to be as many, as it may vary in its
Modes, and entirely in its Essence: viz. Physical motion is either to quantity,
quality, action, passion, relation, situation, duration, to a new Essence, etc.
and particularly to a greater or less quantity, to color, figure, heat,
coldness, etc. This infers, that there are many more universal differences or
kinds of motion than Aristotle stated: However I shall only insist upon these
three, as being most taken notice of: viz. Alteration, which is a change of a
quality of a Physical being: External Local motion, which is a change of the
external place wherein a natural being is seated: And Auction and Diminution,
which are changes of the quantity of a natural being. Alteration (as I said
before in the Chapter of Coct.) is nothing else, but the change of internal
places of the Elements in a mixed body: Thus a body grows hot, when the
intrinsic fire of a mixed body begins to be more united and condensed; and is
nothing else but the change of internal places, which by this fire were
dispersed, and now are reduced in o a lesser number, or into places more united
and less remote. So a mixed body happens to grow colder, when the earthy minims
within it change their places, and are reduced to nearer places, and so grow
more piercing to the center; apprehend the same of the other qualities.
External Local Motion is either understood in a large sense, as it comprehends
alteration or change of internal places, or as it denotes a single internal
motion from an internal place to an internal place, and in this acception we
have made use of the word above in assigning the forms of the Elements; or
strictly it is restrained to external Local Motion, which is the change of an
external place in natural bodies: That is, whereby natural bodies are moved out
of one external place into another. The universal Elements naturally and
strictly are not subjected to Local Motion, since their change of place is only
internal, to wit, within one another: Whereas external Local motion is
restricted to the change of an external place, however we may improperly or in
a large sense conceive them to move locally. Neither are the Elements capable
of auction or diminution, because their quantity and forms are definite;
wherefore they are only apt to undergo alteration, or change of their internal
places, like we have hitherto demonstrated. Mixed bodies are disposed to the
change of their external and internal places: Of their internal it is apparent,
since they are never exempted from alteration; their external is no less
obvious. Auction or Diminution are changes of the Elements in a mixed body both
of internal and external places: That is, do comprehend a local motion and
alteration. The subdivisions of these three are various; but for brevities sake
we shall here only appose that of external Local motion: Which is either
direct, reflex, or circular. A direct motion tends singly from one point to
another in a right line. A reflex motion is either strictly so called, and is
whereby a moveable is reflected or beaten back toward the point (either
perpendicularly or obliquely) whence it first moved; or refracted, (as they
vulgarly term it) whereby a moveable is moved in an oblique Line to a terminus
ad quem. A Circular motion is an oblique motion into a circle: This is either
singly circular, whereby a motion is contorted into one circle; or manifold and
reflected, whereby it is either spirally, or vortically (that is, like a
whirl-pool) contorted into many circles; each inferior circle being reflected
into a greater superior one, or each superior greater circle being reflected
into somewhat a lesser inferior circle. Lastly, Motion is either swift, slow,
or mean: The first is, which in a short time does absolve a long space; The
next, which in a long time absolves but a short space: A mean motion is, which
in a long or short time absolves a mean motion. These definitions and divisions
premitted we shall next adscribe some useful Theorems.

II. All alterative and quantitative motions are absolutely and per se
primarily direct: That the primar and natural motions of the Elements are
direct, their definitions testify; For since they do each primarily move from
their Center to the Circumference, or from the Circumference to the Center, and
that all motions from the Center to the Circumference, and from the
Circumference to the Center are direct, it must necessarily follow, that those
said motions primarily adscribed to them are direct.

2. All external Local motions proper to mixed bodies being moved with an
Element, that enjoys its Center are direct, because such bodies being moved by
the said presupposed Element must be directed to the same term, that the
Element is, which as has been proved is likewise direct.

III. All external Local Motions are violent, or moved by an extrinsick movent:
That is, no natural body, whether mixed or simple, can or does move it self
locally. To wit externally.


I prove it: external Local Motion is caused by expulsion; but all expulsions
(as the name it self does import) are caused by an external principle,
expelling the body, that does disrupt or dispossess it of its place: Ergo. I
confirm the Minor: what, can a body be said to expel it self? Expulsion is
caused by the body injured, but that is the discontinuated and external body
only; Ergo.

2. The body expelled enjoys a center; ergo it cannot move for one, since all
motions are for a center.

3. External Local Motion is caused by compression, but a natural body cannot
compress it self: Ergo. Possibly you may say, that a body may compress the
extraneous body, and so lift it self up: No, for if so, then it is rather
lifted up by the renitency of the extraneous body. But how is a natural body
capable of compressing an extrinsick body? What? By rarefaction; well, if so, a
body cannot rarefie it self: Possibly you will suppose a vertual rarefaction
proceeding from the internal form of a body, and such a quality is not in rerum
natura.

4. The name it self makes the same inference: viz. External Local motion is a
change of external place; ergo the virtue changing must proceed from without or
externally; because it is impossible, that an internal power should reach
beyond its sphere of activity, which extends no further than its internal body
or matter. All bodies do naturally covet rest from external Local motion; ergo
the same external motion must be violent, or from without. Does earth (that is
in particles) ever move Locally out of its place? No, but is attracted or
forced upwards (as in exhalations) by extrinsick efficients, as external air
and fire: In summa all instances in the world do confirm to us, that external
Local Motion is from without. But I instance in particulars: A Bullet being
swallowed down by any living Creature is detruded downwards and evacuated by
stool; but if thrust down its throat, when it is dead, rests in the body;
ergo it is the depressing virtue of that living Creature does extrinsecally
move it locally, since when it is dead the bullet is not affected by any such
motion.

IV. All weighty mixed bodies, being removed from their Element, are disposed to
be detruded downwards from without; but do not move from any internal
inclination they have to their universal center. I prove the latter part;
because all bodies can obtain but one motion for their preservation; but that
is of moving to their own center, whither, whence and whereupon they move;
Ergo. The Minor is confirmed, by that we see, that water and earth in an
extraneous Element, as in the air or fire, do move to their own particular
center, as appears in drops of rain, that fall down from the air. Does not
Mercury move directly to its own center, although it be never so many times
divided? Do not air and fire erupt out of the water in a round bubble? Ergo
their motion was from their own center, as appears by their rotundity. Does
noth a flame in a candle strive to maintain its center? I shall add one
argument more: A part retains the nature of the whole, which in a weighty body
is of moving to its own center, ergo all weighty bodies do primarily move to
their own center: Amputate any member of a living Creature, and you will find
it to shrink immediately into a rotundity, or toward its own center; whereas
had it any inclination or appetite to that body whence it was prescinded, it
would remain in the same shape and form it was cut off, for so it would be
aptest to be reunited. If then all weighty bodies do primarily move to their
own center, how can they then existing in the air move or have an inclination
of moving down to the earth, since they in moving to their own particular
center do manifestly move from her? Ergo there can be no such thing as an
appetite or inclination in mixed bodies to an universal center, when separated
from it; although when united, they have a particular respect to it as a part
has to the whole.

Next I prove the first branch of the Conclusion, viz. That all weighty mixed
bodies being seated without their Element, are disposed to be moved downwards.
Downwards, quasi to it (namely to the center) wards, or into it wards. Upwards
quasi outward, that is, from the Center to the Circumference: Likewise the
German Synonyma's confirms this Etymology, viz. Nach beneden (or downwards,)
quasi Nach binnen or inn, that is into wards: Or nach boven (upwards) quasi
butenwarts, and that quasi ouswarts or outward. Whence we may learn, that in
every particular mixed body there is as properly a downwards, and an upwards, as
in the universal body: So then the fore-stated downwards is to be understood to
the earthwards, (that is to the terraqueous Globe) and upwards from the
earthwards. I say they are disposed to be moved downwards, because they cannot
move themselves thither, but concur to that motion only by their disposition.

V. This disposition is nothing else but the renitency or stubbornness of the
weighty mixed body discontinuating the air or fire, and resisting their motion
to the center-wards; the intension and remission of the said renitency depends
upon the greater or lesser density or crassitude; whence it is also, that some
bodies are moved swifter downwards, because they consist of a greater density
Besides acuteness, as we have observed in the 1 B. 2 Par. as a concomitant of
Density, whereby a weighty body is also the better disposed to cut through the
inferior part of the air, when pressed from the superior.
, sustaining a more violent impulse of the air, which were they less dense,
would be moved slower, because of a less renitency.

2. Or thus, the air being discontinuated by an interposed weighty mixed body
does primarily strive from all parts to a reunion by its expansive virtue,
especially from above, because of its greater strength there, as being less
discontinuated and weakened by exhalations and vapors; whence the greatest
force descending does also direct the impulsion downwards. Wherefore a weighty
body, as Mercury or any other Mineral, is moved much swifter downwards or
(according to the ordinary Ideom of speech) weighs much heavier, on the top of
high hills, than below. But you shall read more in the next Chapt.

VI. All light bodies being seated in a weighty Element are disposed to be
moved upwards, whence it is that subterraneous air is often forced upwards by the
earths compressing virtue: Likewise a piece of Cork depressed under water is by
the waters gravity closing underneath (in the same manner as we have explained
it in the 2. Part. the 1. Book. Chap. 16. 2. Par.) squeezed upwards, without
any intrinsic propensity; for otherwise the same Cork being also disposed to
be pressed downwards in the air must be supposed to have two internal
propensities, which is absurd.

A flame burning in the ayry Regions is forced upwards by its disposition of
levity, tenuity and rarity: Thus; The air sinding it self injured by the
discontinuating flame presses upon her and strives from all sides to squeeze
her away; The flame being overpowered is forced to slip or slide away, whether
its disposition may best yield; downwards it cannot tend, because there it is
resisted by the courser air infested with weighty peregrin Elements; Ergo
upwards, because there it finds the way most open to give free passage to its
light rarity and tenuity: On the contrary, a weighty body, because of its
density and crassitude, finds the passage clearer downwards, by reason it is
most driven from the tenuity of the air atop: but supposing the air to enjoy
its center doubtless those weighty bodies, would be cast forth upwards to the
Circumference.

VII.. Ayry bodies, that are seated in a fiery Element, are moved downwards,
because the rarity of the fire, sinking downwards for a center, does impell
them also thither, whose disposition being continuous and thin are the better
disposed to slide away from the fire (compressing them all about) downwards,
because upwards the said bodies striving to maintain their particular Centers
would be more discontinuated, where the force of fire must also be strongest:
Whence you may observe, that weighty bodies and light bodies are both moved to
one terminus ad quem in the fiery regions.

Touching the causes of refraction and reflection you shall read them in the
next Chapter.

Hence a great part of the first Book of the second Part, will be rendered much
plainer, which I did forbear to illustrate further, because of avoiding
needless repetitions, intending to treat of these by themselves, viz. why water
or any other weighty body, being violently detained, is much intended in its
strength; or why water is more depressing atop, or when it is most remote from
her Center than underneath, namely because of the depression of the air, adding
much to the drowning of a man, as we have mentioned in 12th. and 16th.
Chapters, and so many other passages.

CHAP. XX. Of Attraction, Expulsion, Projection, Disruption, Undulation, and
Recurrent Motion.
1. How air is attracted by a water-spout or Siphon. 2. The manner of another
kind of Attraction by a sucking Leather. 3. How two flat Marble stones clapped
close together draw one another up. 4. How a Wine-Coopers Pipe attracts Wine
out of a Cask. 5. How sucking with ones mouth attracts water. 6. How a Sucker
attracts the water. 7. The manner of Attraction by Filtration. 8. The manner of
Electrical attraction. 9. How fire and fiery bodies are said to attract. 10.
What Projection is, and the manner of it. 11. What Disruption, Undulation, and
Recurrent motion are.


1. I Thought fit to subject these remaining kinds of motion to the preceding,
and to treat of them in a distinct Chapter: viz. Attraction, Expulsion,
Projection, Disruption, Undulation, and Recurrent motion. I shall only insist
upon some particular kinds of attraction. What Attraction is, the name does
explain.

How air is attracted by water, and water properly by air, has been proposed
in the foregoing Chapters; Attraction is further evident.

1. In a Siphon or water-spout, wherewith they usually cast up water for to
quench a fire. Here the water is attracted by the drawing up of the Sucker; not
through a bending for to avoid a Vacuum; but through the natural cohesion in
continuancy of the air to the Sucker or aerial parts contained within the
Sucker: Now the air does cohere more strongly, because there is no body to
discontinue it within the Siphon, but is rather assisted in a continuated
cohesion by the continuity of the sides of the Siphon and of the Sucker. Or
otherwise if the air did strive to separate, how could it? For suppose it
should be discontinuated from the Sucker, then through that discontinuation
there must be some certain void space effected: if so, then that air, which did
before fill up that void space, must have been withdrawn into some other place,
or else it must through penetration have sunk into its own substance; besides
the air that was expelled up vards must have penetrated into its own body by
condensation, or into the body of the water, all which is impossible, since a
penetration of bodies is an annihilation. But here inquiry may be made, whether
it is the continuated cohesion of the air with the water causes the succession
of the water upon the air; or whether the air, which through haling up of the
Sucker is expelled upwards out of the Siphon, does for to procure a place
protrude the air cohering about the external sides of the Siphon downwards into
the water, through whose insufflation the water is propelled upwards into the
Siphon. I answer both ways; for it is impossible, that such a great weight of
water should ascend so easily with so little a force as the attraction of the
Sucker, unless it were assisted by the strong force of the air pomped out, out
of a necessity and impossibility of shrinking pressing down, and protruding the
water upwards. That this is so, the external circular pressure and dent, which
we see about the outsides of the water about the lower end of the Siphon, and
the internal pussing up of the water within the Siphon do testify.

II. Another kind of Attraction not unlike to this is observable in boys their
sucking Leathers, being wetted and clapped flat upon a stone, and afterward
drawn up with a packthread fastened in it attracts the stone with it. The cause
is alone the continuous cohesion of the water to the stone, defending it self
from the disruption of the air, the which as soon as breaking through occasions
the separation of the Leather from the stone.

III. Two smooth flat equal Marble stones clapped close one upon the other, the
uppermost attracts the lowermost, if equally lifted up from their Center, by a
ring fastened to it, because of the air through its continuity sticking fast to
the lowermost and the undermost stones; but if disrupted through an unequal
lifting the lowermost stone falls.

In the same manner does a plain board cast upon the water attract it into a
Rising, when lifted up by the central part.

IV. A Wine-Coopers Pipe attracts Wine out of the bung-hole of a Cask: The Pipe
is somewhat long, and narrower toward the bottom and the top, but wider in the
middle, which thrust open at both ends into a Cask full of Wine through the
Bung-hole, and afterward applying one's Thum close to the hole atop may
attract a competent quantity of Wine out of the Vessel, which with the opening
of the upper hole runs out again. But methinks that this and the forementioned
attractions might rather be termed cohesions or detensions, since that which
does attract is the extrinsick attractor, viz. ones arm. The cause of its
attraction is the immission of the Pipe into the Cask, to a certain depth,
where the air being excluded from it and closed with your Thumb, you will find
a drawing or sucking to your Thumb, which is nothing else but the weight of the
Wine pressed downwards, and notwithstanding cleaving fast to the continuity of
your Thumb, which being continuous and obtuse does sustain the liquor
continuated to it; whereas were it subtle, that it could give way as the free
air, it would not be contained so. But suppose you thrusted a Beaker with the
mouth downwards under water, and stopped a small hole made on the bottom of it
with your Thumb, the water would not keep in there, because the air would enter
underneath, through which the parts of the water would be disunited, and so
desert the supposed cohesion of parts: why the Wine descends at the opening of
the upper hole, is through the impulse of the air entering.

V. The sucking of water through a Reed by the mouth is effected, by causing a
flat closs cohesion of your Tongue and lips with the continuous parts of water
or air; for what is contiguous cannot be sucked (unless by means of its
inherency in continuous bodies,) because its parts are unapt to cohere. To all
these kinds of cohesions or adhesions the closeness of sides of those external
bodies, that cohere together through the internal cohesion of air, does mainly
contribute by keeping off the discontinuating air; as the closeness of the
sucking leather sticking, of the two Marble stones, of the sides of the
Wine-Coopers Pipe, of the Lips in sucking, etc.

VI. A Sucker, otherwise called a Siphon, being a Pipe consisting of two arms
of an unequal length, meeting in a curvilineal Angle, attracts water out of a
Vessel until it be all run out, provided it be set running by sucking the
water down to the lowermost part of the longer arm, being placed without the
said Vessel. This instance gives us a plain demonstration, that attraction is
caused by the means of the cohesion of continuous parts to other continuous
ones, especially if separated through a close Cane from dividing bodies (as the
air) and by the same cause kept close together; for water as I said before,
will always through its weight and continuity cohere and keep close to its
next central parts, and never separates unless through a disunion by the air or
other bodies. Hence it is also, that water is easily led to any height As in
fountains that are led over a mountain, or in Machins that raise the water
higher than its source.
, if impelled by any force through a close Pipe, or by a Sucker. But why water
contained within the shorter arm should yield to water contained within the
longer may justly be doubted: The reason is, because the water contained within
the longer Pipe being more in quantity is heavier than the other, and therefore
prevails, and is more disposed for to be pressed downwards: But then you might
reply, That the water of the shorter Pipe is assisted in weight by the other
proportion contained within the capacity of the Vessel. I answer, That the
water of the shorter arm is impelled forward through the pressure of the said
water contained within the capacity of the Vessel: But not through its own
gravity pressing downward toward the Center of the world; for every proportion
of water (as I said before) retaining the nature of their universal Element
only strives for to maintain its own center, and therefore water if enjoying a
center within its own Circumference, wherever it be, does not press or weigh,
but strives to maintain its nature in rest: But that, which does cause a force
upon water downwards in the Vessel, is the strong sinking down of the air
tending downwards for its Center: For otherwise water in a Vessel would contain
it self in a round figure, which it cannot, because it is reduced to a flatness
by the sinking air.

VII. Attraction by Filtration is performed by causing one end of a piece of
Flannell or other woollen cloth to hang into any Liquor over the brim of the
containing Vessel, and the other end into an empty one, whereby the light parts
of the water ascend up the cloth, and distill into the other Vessel. This is
effected by separating the thick parts of water and rarefying it through the
labels subtle fibers, whence the other heavy parts of the water by descending
downwards and being pressed by the air do over-press its subtiler and aerial
parts upwards, the grosser and heavier remaining behind. By this it appears,
that Filtration and other kinds of Attraction already mentioned are not so much
Attractions as violent Expulsions. As the water of a Sucker will not run out
unless the longer arm exceeds the depth of the water in length, so neither will
water attracted by a filter distill down into the empty vessel, unless the
distilling Label be lower than the water contained within the other Vessel for
the same reason.

VIII. Attraction effected by Amber or other Bituminous bodies, otherwise
called Electrical attraction, depends on emanations or continuous steams
emitted from Amber (especially if rubbed) consisting of incrassated air and
fire, being impelled circularly until where they are gathered by a continuous
body, which if light do return with those emanations upwards; for the said
emanations being diducted, expansive and light, are by the weighty
(comparative) vapourous air of this lower Region striving to keep their
nearness to the center squeezed and propelled upwards, which commonly tends to
the emitting body, because the greater quantity of those steams are gathered
perpendicularly under the said emitting body, and so do return the same way.
Hence observe, That Amber does not attract so potently on the top of high
Mountains, because its steams, being weightier than the air is there, do spread
themselves further, whereby they are deprived of a return: Neither will Amber
attract in a thick vapourous air, because its steams are detained from
dispersion.

IX. Fire and fiery bodies, as Onions, Soap, etc. are said to attract; but
improperly, because their attraction is nothing else but an expulsion of those
bodies, which they are imagined to attract; For instance: Fire is said to
attract water, air, etc. This is nothing else but fire piercing into the
substance of water or air, whereby it does expel them into those places, which
it leaves, or which are near to it: Hence vapors are seldom attracted, or
rather expelled into the places where fire does continually pass, as directly
under the Equator, because it fills those places with its own presence, but
are reflected toward the sides as toward the North and South Pole, whose
spaces are not filled up with its torrid rays. Now judge a little of that most
barbarous practice among Physicians in applying Reddishes, Salt, leaven, yea
Epispastick Plasters to the Wrists and Feet of Feverish Patients: What rage,
what torments are poor men put to, how are their Fevers, Paraphrensies
exacerbated through their diabolical practice? These things do not attract
without piercing into a man's Veins and Arteries, and through their greater
force of heat and violence do protrude the less heat of the body, and by a
short stay do put the whole body into a consuming fire; How many men have I
seen murdered in that manner? It Is true in malignant and Pestilential Fevers
they have their use, but not in single putrid ones. Now by what has been
proposed in this Paragraph we may easily apprehend the manner of all
waterworks, and of raising water higher than its source, as that which is
performed by the invention of Archimedes through a brazen or leaden Serpent, or
by wheels impelling water into Pipes, etc. Hence we may also conceive the
manner of the attraction, or rather expulsion of the degrees of water in a
Thermometer, or invention to measure the degrees of heat and cold, and the
differences of them in several Rooms, Towns, Seasons of the year, etc. The
Instrument is nothing but a long glass Pipe, toward the end somewhat turning
up, being left open for to pour in any liquor, which according to the
rarefaction or condensation of the air contained within the Pipe above will
either ascend or descend in so many more or less degrees, as the air is altered
by rarefaction through the heat of the ambient air, or condensation through the
cold minims of earth within the said ambient air compressing the water more or
less through its increase of quantity.

Touching the Magdenburg Invention; the air is attracted outward in the same
manner, as we have explained the attraction of water by a water-spout, namely
by a continuation, cohesion, and adhesion to the Sucker: The air attracted out
of the capacity of the Receiver does also through the same means attract air
and fire, inhering in the rarefied and attenuated water without in the koop;
that again in the koop attracts air from without for to fill up its spaces,
which is as ready to press in, because that air, which was pumped out of the
capacity, wants room without. This succession of air is continuated by pumping,
until the air within is quite filled up with the incrassated air attracted
from without, whose thickness will not suffer it self to be pumped out any
longer; so that, as the air within begins to be incrassated, so the pumping
without falls harder and harder. Toward the latter end there seems to be a
forcible retraction of the Sucker making a great noise through its return,
because the capacity of the Receiver being replenisht to the very pores of the
glass, which being rendered somewhat flexible through the passing and tumefying
of the incrassated and rarefied air, afterward beginning to condense through
greater access of fire, is violently through the great external force of the
pumping somewhat forced to bend or yield inwards, whose renitency and force to
return retracts the Sucker through continuation and cohesion of the incrassated
air.

Next we are to pursue the manner of acceleration of weighty bodies downwards.
It is certain that a natural mixed weighty body, falling directly down from atop
without interruption to the bottom, does acquire a greater celerity the further
it recedes from the beginning of its descent; because the lower or farther it
descends through propulsion of the superior air, the more and the greater body
(viz. of air under it) it compresses, which for to prevent the penetration of
its own body is the more and violenter irritated to run round about the
descending weighty body for to recover the place left by the said body, where
arriving does as it were rebound against the superior parts of the air, which
does very much intend the celerity of the said bodies motion, and the same
gradually increasing does also gradually accelerate the descending body the
further it falls. Some are of opinion, that the acceleration of descending
bodies is caused by Atoms falling down from the Celestial Orbs, which as they
do more and more increase by being retained by the descending body, do likewise
more and more accelerate its descent. This can scarce be, because those Atoms,
reflecting and returning from the Surface of the Terrestrial Globe, are in
greater number underneath the body than above; ergo according to that manner of
reasoning a body falling from on high should rather be gradually retarded.

3. A body should also fall swifter in the Winter than in the Summer, in cold
Countries than in hot, because those Atoms are most numerous there; but the
contrary is true. Ergo no true consequence.

In like manner do light bodies acquire a greater swiftness in ascending, the
higher they are propelled, whence it is that Fowl flying high move much swifter
than below. Retardation is caused through causes opposite to these now
mentioned.

X. Projection is, whereby a body is moved swifter by the forcible impulse of
the Projector, than it would do otherwise. Thus an Arrow is swiftly moved out
of a Bow, or a stone being cast out of the hand; because of the force of the
impulse of the Projector. The cause of the intention of this impulse is the
great swiftness of the said impulse To wit, impressed upon the air by the
Projector.
at the beginning, whereby the air is swiftly propelled before, whose most
swift return about the sides of the body projected causes the continuation of
the swiftness of the first impulse, but gradually diminishing by how much the
further it recedes from the beginning. A ball projected out of a Canon is
propelled with that swiftness, because of the swiftness of the first smart
impulse. The truth of the foresaid reason and manner is apparent in shooting a
pole through the water, where we may see the water at the farther end raised
into a tumor, which running Namely, for to recover its place and to avoid a
penetration of bodies.
about the sides to the other end causes its propulsion: Whence it is also
that when there appears no more of the tumor of the water before the pole, its
motion does instantly cease.

XI. Disruption or bursting is a sudden separation of the parts of a body
through a violent force moving from within. This we see happens often in Canons,
when overcharged; or in bottels filled with water being frozen in the Winter,
o. Wine in the Summer being close stopped: The cause of these latter must be
imputed to frosty or fiery minims, entering through the pores of the bottels in
greater quantity than their capacity can take in, and disrupting them for to
avoid a penetration of bodies. Bodies are often said to burst through dryness,
(as Instruments, etc.) but very improperly, since it is the fiery or frosty
minims entering their pores and filling their capacities, and afterward
disrupting them because of avoiding a penetration of bodies: So
Instrument-strings are apt to break in moist weather, because their
continuation is disrupted through penetration of moist bodies into their pores.

Undulation is a motion, whereby a body is moved to and fro, like to water
shaken in a basin, or to the motion of a Bell. The cause is likewise adscribed
to the first motion of the Impulsor, which being terminated at the end of its
return is beat back through the direct descent of the air impelling it, by
reason it lies athwart.

Recurrent motion being but little different from this, I shall therefore say
no more of it.

The cause of reflection is the return of the impulse impressed upon the air or
water (both being media deferentia) perpendicularly or obliquely upwards from a
hard and plane reflecting body: Of refraction, the cause is the shuving off of
the impulse downwards by the shelving sides of an angular hard body.

CHAP. XXI. Of Fire, being an Introduction to a New Astronomy.
1. The Fires division into three Regions. 2. The qualification of the
inferior Region. What the Sun is. What his torrid Rays are, and how
generated. 3. How the other Planets were generated. 4. How the fixed Stars were
generated. 5. A further explanation of the Stars their Ventilation. That there
are many Stars within the Planetary Region that are invisible. Of the
appearance of new Stars or Comets. Of the Galaxia or Milk-way. 6. That the
fiery Regions are much attenuated.


I. THe ground of the fires tending downwards you may easily collect from what
I have set down touching the waters and airs commerce with the other Elements.
Its profundity we may likewise divide into three Regions; The first whereof
containing the Planetary bodies, the next the fixed Stars, and the third
consisting most of purefire.

II. The inferior Region, through its nearer approximation to the air and its
immersion into it, is cast into a subtle flame, whose subtility does effuge our
sight and Tact. The Sun is a great body generated out of the peregrin Elements
contained in the inferior igneous Region, consisting most of condensed fire
and incrassated air, extended and blown up into the greatest flame, and
conglomerated within the greatest fiery cloud. These igneous clouds are like to
the windy clouds of the air, which as they do daily blast down wind upon the
earth, so do these cast fiery rays, among which that, which surrounds the Sun,
does vendicate the greatest power to it self. The manner of casting of its
fiery rays is the same with that of winds: viz. The Region of fire forces up
In the same manner as we have described the air to force up water in vapors.
every day or continually a great quantity of air, somewhat incrassated and
condensed, into its own sphere through its descending force striving for a
Center: This incrassated and condensed air is impelled violently into the body
of the Stars by other subtle flames, as being more forcible to drive the said
adventitious matter from them, because their parts are so closely engaged, that
they can scarce slow a minim without a penetration. Wherefore they must
necessarily be impelled gradually into the bodies of the Stars, because these
are mixed bodies, that give way so much in themselves by expelling fiery or
torrid minima's down into the air, as to be capacious enough of receiving so
many airy particles, as the Elementary fire does force up every moment. But
before I proceed in unfolding the manner of the Celestial mixed bodies their
ventilations; I must insist somewhat further upon their constitution.

III. The Celestial mixed bodies are not only like to clouds in their daily and
minutely ventilations, but also in their constitutions: viz. The inferior ones
(as the Planets) are constituted out of the courser and more mixed matter of the
finer cloudy air in the inferior Region of the Element of fire, like the
clouds of the inferior Region of air are constituted out of the courser part
of vapors. Their coagulation is effected through the force of the fiery
Element crushing their matter from below upwards, and again is repelled back
from the superior parts of the said fiery Elements, because through its being
pressed up are scanted of room, and therefore do press downwards not only for
room, but also because of reuniting where they are divided by the said
coagulated bodies.

Now it may easily appear to you.

1. Whence that rotundity, or rather globosity, does arrive to them, viz.
because they are circularly crushed.

2. Because the air and fire of the said Planets do naturally spread themselves
equally from the Center to the Circumference, whence a circular figure must
needs follow. Also,

3. That Stars are nothing else but the thicker and denser part of the Heavens,
coagulated into fiery mixed bodies; to wit, flames.

3. That as they do decrease by Ventilation every day, so they do also increase
by the introsusception of new aerial particles.

4. That they must necessarily be very durable, because of the duration of
their causes: For as the great force of the inferior parts of the igneous
Heavens never desist from striving for the Center, and do every day cast up
great proportions of aerial matter, so do the superior parts never cease from
compressing them into the bodies of the other condensed flames being disposed
(as I said before) through their ventilation to receive them.

2. Because the aerial parts, being got into the Center of the flames, cease
from all external Local motion, striving only to maintain their Center in rest.

IV. Fixed Stars are generated out of the subtiler parts of the forementioned
aerial evaporations, To wit, being incorporated with fire.
, being through their less resisting gravity (redounding from water and earth
in them) rendered capable of being screwed up higher to the second Region, where
they are coagulated through the same motions of the Heavens that Planetary
clouds are. These are responding to the permanent clouds of the second Region
of the air, which as they are spread into more large extended bodies, wherein
many knobs seem to be unequally coagulated through the unequal proportion of
the mixture of the vapors, even so are these evaporations coagulated into long
large bodies, within which again other coagulations are effected, of unequal
proportions, rising like so many knobs of various magnitudes, which constitute
the fixed Stars, well deserving the Epithete of being fixed or fastened in those
vast igneous clouds.

We diduct hence: 1. That the fixed Stars are smaller than the Planets, because
their matter is the overplus of the Planets.

2. That they were formed after the Planets, because their matter must be
arrived to the first Region, before the subtiler parts could appel to the
second Region for the matter of others.

3. That the difference between the loose and fixed Stars is no other, than
that these latter consist of a more compact flame than the others, and thence
we may also collect them to be more durable.

V. But to make pursuit of the manner of ventilation of the Stars: The fiery
minims striking down vehemently upon them, because they are screwed up more and
more by the continual access of new coagulations impelled into the said Stars,
must necessarily be intended in their force upon them for to recover their
place and continuation: These then striking from all sides through those
Celestial mixed bodies do expel, shake down, and effuse Compare the generation
of winds hereunto, for the manner is the same of both.
continually great showers of those torrid minims consisting of condensed fire,
which are accelerated likewise in their descent through the depression of the
air. These as they pass do heat the air, especially in the lower Region,
because of the density of the clouds and air staying their beams. And 2.
Because of their reflection from the earth. These fiery showers do scarce reach
any farther than the temperate Zones: Where they rain down perpendicularly
there they leave marks of their heat; where obliquely, there of warmth only;
but the air within the Polars is not sensible of so much as their warmth. These
showers do fall down sometimes in a greater confluence than others, whence they
cast a greater heat, which happens through their meeting and being united with
more aerial matter or igneous clouds, or else through want of shelter under
dense clouds in the air; or thirdly by uniting their showers with those of
other Planets. Hence we may observe, That the Sun is the hottest body in the
Heavens, and therefore the loosest and the softest. 2. That the Moon and the
other Stars consist of a less soft consistency. 3. That the fixed Stars, as
they do heat but little, so they dissolve but little, and therefore must be of
a yet less soft consistency. 4. That the fiery clouds being supposed globous,
and therefore profound, do harbor many invisible lights; whereof some do
happen sometimes to be detruded out of their seat downwards (that is toward
the earth) through the continuated and exuperant force of the superior parts
of the Element of fire: This is seldom observed but in the lower Region of the
fire, because that Element does use its greatest force there, as being near to
the place of strife for its Center, and most pincht there by the obtruded
igneous clouds. These new appearing Lights do sometimes keep within sight for
eight or ten Months, some longer, others shorter, and afterward disappear
again, whence they come under the notion of Comets, agreeing in nothing with
them except in their disappearing after a certain times luster. The cause of
their disappearance I impute to the bearing up of the air upwards by the
inferior fiery rays, and carrying those dislocated Stars out of sight again,
where they are included within a dense igneous cloud. 5. New Stars are often
generated within the bulk of the foresaid clouds, whose smalness and close
inclusion does render them invisible; Others again are dissolved through being
overpowered by the force of the fiery Element. 6. The Galaxia or milky-way is
nothing but a great number of small dusky lights or inequalities coagulated out
of the grosser part of the peregrin Elements of the lower igneous Region.

VI. Lastly, Like as you see that the Element of water, which naturally
consists of the greatest thickness, is reduced to that tenuity through such a
great proportion of air, and that the air is from the greatest tenuity
incrassated through such a quantity of water and earth into clouds throughout
its whole body, even the same we must imagine of fire; viz. that it is reduced
from the greatest rarity to a condensation and attenuation into large igneous
clouds That is, is bound up by the continuous tenuity of the air.
throughout its body, through the vast admixture of air somewhat incrassated
and condensed. These clouds in the lower Region are diducted and separated into
many thick and profound ones; in the second Region into those of a great
tenuity, but more cohering.

Thus we have briefly exposed to your view the commerce of fire with the other
Elements, and for your better understanding have caused this Scheme to be
inserted, where you have the universal flames striking downwards for a Center,
whereas after the first knock it flamed upwards in the Chaos; because it moved
from its own Center. The proportions of fire and air to both the other
Elements, although not very exactly cut according to my Copy, yet comes near to
it. The Stars are there represented according to their several Regions wherein
they are seated. The motion of the heavens is likewise there exhibited as we
have demonstrated it in the preceding Paragraphs; All which, with many others
insisted upon in this and the subsequent Chapter, you have here plainly
proposed.



CHAP. XXII. Of the Motion of the Element of fire.
1. Where the Poles of the Heavens are. 2. The Opinions of Ptolomy and Tycho
rejected. 3. That the Planets move freely and loosely, and why the fixed Stars
are moved so uniformly. 4. The Suns retrograde motion unfolded, and the cause
of it. 5. How the Ecliptic, Equator, and the Zodiac were first found out. 6.
The manner of the fiery Heavens their ventilation. 7. Whence it is, that the
Sun moves swifter through the Austrinal Mediety, and slower through the Boreal.
How the Sun happens to measure a larger fiery Tract at some seasons in the same
time than at others. 8. Whence the difference of the Suns greatest declination
in the time of Hipparchus, Ptolomy, and of this our age happens. 9. An
undoubted and exact way of Calculating the natural end of the World. The manner
of the Worlds dissolution; The same proved also by the holy Scriptures. The
prevention of a Calumny.


I. I have formerly discoursed upon the motion of the Heavens from East to
West, assigning the violent detention from their Center for the cause of it, I
shall repeat nothing more of it than put you in mind that nothing can move
circularly except upon two immovable points, which are therefore named the
Poles from sustaining their body. The immobility, which we observe in this our
Hemisphere near the Bear Stars, persuades us to take it for the North or
Arctick Pole, to which the South or Antartick Pole is opposite, visible only in
the other Hemisphere. Between these the Heavens move from East to West, and
where they measure most space, there they mark out the AEquinoctial Line, a
greater Circle imagined or described by us to be in the Heavens equidistant
from each Pole, that is, elevated above either of them 90 degrees.

II. Touching the motion of the Stars let us enquire, whether according to
Ptolomy they are affixed to Orbs, and move along with them, or whether they
move free and loose like Fish in the water, as Tycho Brahe conceived. It is
strange to consider how the Ancients often assumed false suppositions, builded
for many Ages upon them, and retained them as Oracles: All this doubtless
befell them through neglect of making further search and trial into their
realities. What stupid fixions did they harbor touching the solidity of the
Orbs, excusing the defect of their noise by their remoteness, imagining their
harmony to be most pleasant to any Ear that could hear it. Their variety (were
they not excused by being imaginary only) would exceed all probability of
belief: Some they imagine to be Concentrical or Excentrical, which latter are
either greater Excentrical, or lesser excentrical, alias Epicycles. Some again
are both Concentrical and Excentrical, and others are Concentrical within a
Concentrical. Some are deferring, others equalizing, and what not for to drive
away their time? In summa they were at least 80 in number. Certainly no natural
Philosopher can be adduced to believe these kinds of Fictions, knowing those
bodies assigned for Orbs to be soft, and therefore unfit to cohere in so many
Sections. But Tycho Brahe's dream is much more disagreeing, since it is
impossible, that such loose bodies could move in such an exact and equal order,
as the fixed Stars do; for otherwise were they loose, as Planets are, they
would move as variously and disorderly as they.

III. Wherefore I conclude, 1. That the Planets, particularly the Sun and Moon
do move freely and loose, being included within great fiery clouds, because
their motions are very different one from the other, which otherwise could not
be, supposing they were affixed to Orbs.

2. The fixed Stars cohere in large igneous clouds linked together, out of
whose bodies they are constituted, and with them they are also moved: This
their equal and regular motion makes clear to us. But I will take the pains to
explain their motion to you more particularly, and begin with the Sun.

IV. The Sun we observe appears once in 24 hours to all the Inhabitants of the
torfid and temperate Zones, being moved from East to West. I suppose you to
remember and assume that maxim so often repeated, viz. That no body whether mixed
or single has a power of moving it self locally to an external place, although
from an external place it may, so long as it obtains an internal Center.
Whence I conclude, That the Sun does not move through himself from East to
West, but is carried along with the fiery Heavens, as a cloud with the air, or
Ship with the flowing Ocean, and so they both happen to measure almost an equal
space in an equal time, saving in one degree of time and space every day of a
Tropical year, consisting of 360 Solar days; which depends upon some
resistency or renitency the Sun has to external Local Motion or vection, like
we observe in a Ship driving with the stream, yet not so fast as the stream,
because there is some resistance in the Ship: whence it is apparent that the
Sun is moved forward every natural day only 359 degrees, which occasioneth the
Suns staying back one degree every day, whereby in 360 days it must
necessarily stay back the Circumference of the whole fiery Heavens; and hence
it is, that the Sun does appear to us every day one degree sooner or latter, as
you may apprehend it. This staying back or retrograde motion Astronomers are
pleased to call the proper motion of the Sun, whereby he moves through himself
through the succession of the Signs, or against the motion of the Primum
mobile; which is absurd, for then he must needs be an Animal; because only
Animals can move to an external place through themselves.

This Retrogradation of the Sun is naturally directed from West toward East,
but through the unequal access of cloudy fire daily driven up from one of the
Poles spouting out strong showers of condensed fire, is shoven and driven every
day somewhat to the side, viz. Northerly, when the said fiery clouds are
impelled from the South side, which lasts as long as until that tract has
vented its burden, and cast it down toward the other side, and impelled the
Sun to his greatest Northern declination, and by that time the Northern
Hemisphere is so much filled with fiery clouds, that it is necessitated to vent
it self through casting its condensed fire toward the South, whereby the Sun
is impelled again to the other side. The way, described through the Suns being
thus shoven from one side to the other, and yet gradually staying back from
West to East, is called the Ecliptic, whose greatest declination toward
either side North or South is distant from the Equator 23 degrees.

V. The Ancients observing the daily and monthly staying back of the Sun, in
that he appeared now in such a declination or amplitude, a month after 30
degrees further, and the next month as many further, and so on, until they had
found out the Romb of the Sun, viz. The Ecliptic, phansied another Line much
broader than this directly above among the stars of the Firmament, apprehending
them all along that road, (to wit, through the Septentrional and Meridional
declination,) so many as would constitute a twelfth part of the Ecliptic, to
be like to some living creature or other, that so they might know them again;
Hence they imagined one twelfth part of those Stars to be situated in such a
position as to be like unto a Ram, wherefore they did all agree to name it
Aries; the Stars next following this twelfth part to be like a Bull, whence
they called that Taurus; and so on with the rest. Afterward this whole Road
was called by the name of Zodiac, from (...), a living creature, as if they
would have termed it a circle of living Creatures, that is like to them. So you
see they did not pass through any great difficulty to make these observations
and describe all the Circles of the heavens; for after they had once found out
one Pole, they must needs have concluded there must be another: Then they cold
not but observe the firmament moving between these Poles; next that the middle
must be the greatest course, and therefore a rule and measure of all other
Phanomena's, which for that reason they called the Equator or Equinoctial: Now
having found out these three great marks for their guide, namely the Pole,
Equinoctial, and the Zodiac, the other circles and observations of the motions
of the Planets were easily made. This by the way.

VI. Before I go on any further, I will prove, that such a vast measure of
fiery winds blows down from each of the Polar Regions for six months together.
It is certain, That a great proportion of fiery clouds is cast from the middle
or Equinoctial of the fiery Heavens toward the Poles, because there they are
the strongest, as appears by their strong and swift motion, measuring more way
by far there than about the Polars, wherefore the greatest part of those fiery
clouds must necessarily be detruded toward the Polars, as being the weaker
parts of the heavens, and therefore the apter for their reception. These clouds
being obtruded thither in great quantities are compressed by the force of the
Superior heavens, whereby the condensed fiery minims break forth in great
showers, which blowing constantly for six months do always blow the Sun from
them toward the opposite side.

2. If clouds of the air are most detruded toward their Polars, and blow
thence constantly for a long season Witness the ^sones.
, as Mariners tell us they do; Ergo the same must happen in the fiery Region,
since the efficient causes and materials are corresponding.

3. The fiery Region pressing strongly about the middle parts must needs cast
up most air toward the Polars.

4. Before there can be an eruption of these fiery clouds, there must a certain
abundance or proportion be collected, through whose over possession and
exceeding swelling they may sooner give way to burst out; and then being opened
they continue their fiery winds for six months, and by that time they are quite
evacuated. In the mean time the other Polar side is a filling, and is just
grown swelled enough for to burst out against the other is exhausted.

Here may be objected, That whilst one Pole is evacuating, it should attract
all the matter from the other Pole, because it gives way, whereas the other
cannot.

I answer, That those fiery clouds through their giving way are still daily
somewhat supplied by the continual casting up of the heavens; for otherwise
their ventilation could hardly be so lasting; but however that viz. the
adventitious matter:
is sooner evacuated than the clouds can be shut up again, so that the
ventilation lasts until all its contained matter is expelled.

2. It is impossible that the air should be attracted from the opposite side,
since the greatest force of the middle parts of the inferionr Region is
between, which screweth the matter up equally toward each Pole.

VII. The Suns deficient motion (that is, when he is accidentally moved through
the succession of the Constellations of the Zodiac,) if compared to himself is
observed to be regular; that is, in comparing one tropical or deficient course
with another both do agree in the measure of space, being over-runned in an
equal time, viz. of 360 Solar days; and in an equal Velocity, moving in the
same swiftness through the same Constellations in one year, that he does in
another. But if the particular motions of one defective or tropical course be
referred to others of the same annual motion, we shall find that the Sun is
more potently withheld under the Meridional Signs than under the Septentrional
ones: That is, moves swifter through the Austral Mediety in the Winter,
consuming but 178 days 21 hours and 12 minut. in that peragration, and flower
through the Boreal Signs in the Summer, spending 186 days 8 hours 12 minutes
(computing with the Vulgar 365 days 5 hours, 49 min. 16 sec. in the year,) so
that the difference is 7 days and 11 hours.

2. The Sun appears sometimes at some seasons of the year higher then at
others, that is, sometimes nearer to us, and other times farther from us; or
otherwise the Sun is at the highest and farthest in the Summer in the month of
June, being then in Cancer, and at the lowest or nearest in the month of
December, being then in Capricorn.

Touching the former of these properties, whether the said Velocity be real, or
a Phenomenon only; Or whether if supposed real or a Phenomenon, the same does
appear alike to our Southern Antipodes; or whether on the contrary the Sun does
not appear to them to stay longer in the Southern Mediety, and shorter in the
Northern, and whether the inhabitants directly under the Equator do deprehend
the same that we do, may be justly doubted. If the observation of the Southern
Antipodes agree with ours, then we must conclude the extent of motion to be
real, and the Sun to stay away longer in one Mediety then in another; but if
otherwise, and that those under the Equinoctial do observe no longer stay of
the Sun on one side than on another, then it is only apparent and to be imputed
to a hallucination and refraction. But the former is more probable, whose cause
must be referred to the slowness of eruption of the arctick fiery showrs, and
therefore is not so soon or potently impelled from that Mediety. 3. The Sun
when harboring in the Equinox moves through a greater space in the same time
then when deflecting thence, and the more deflecting the less space he measures
in the same time; because then he follows the course of the Equinoctial,
(supposing the Sun in a) whose Diameter ab must needs be longer than from d f,
when the Sun existing in d (suppose him then to be in his greatest declination)
moves in the same time to f. Or otherwise the higher the Sun appears, the more
way he makes in the same time; but he is higher in a than in d, and therefore
makes more way. The reason, why the Sun appears higher to us in the Summer, is,
because he approaches nearer to our Zenith, and thence we say he is higher,
because a thing that is over our heads seems to be higher than that which is
remote from us, although the Sun being then compared to the Center of the
Terrestrial Globe is not higher than he was when he was most remote from us.

VIII. The greatest declination of the Sun has formerly in the days of
Hipparchus and Ptolomy been observed to be of 23 degrees. 52 mi. which according to
Copernicus his observation is reduced to 30 min. by others since to 28. The
cause is evident, and is to be imputed to the Suns, or rather the fiery Regions
gaining upon the inferior Elements; namely, the water gains upon the earth,
and diducts her mole, the air gains upon them both and insufflates their
bodies, and lastly the fire gains upon the air, through which means it must
necessarily incline nearer to the Center of the Earth, which approximation must
cause a diminution of the Suns declination: For instance, suppose the Sun in
Hipparchus his time to have been at the height of o, being then in his greatest
declination from the Equinoctial a b; if then since through the fiery Regions
having gained upon the other Elements, the Sun is descended from o to (...),
being there nearer to the Center of the Earth, his greatest declination in
(...) must needs be less to e than it is from o to (...).



IX. Hence we may easily collect the duration of the World thus: If the fiery
Region has gained from the time or years of Ptolomy to Copernicus so many
minutes of the other Elements, in how many years will the fire gain the restant
minutes? This being found out by the rule of proportion will resolve us, when
the World shall be returned again into a confusion or Chaos; so that you may
observe, as at the beginning of the world the weighty Elements did gradually
expel, and at last overpower the light ones, so the light ones do now
gradually gain upon the weighty ones, and at last will again overpower them:
and so you have a description of the long year consisting of 20 thousand Solar
Circuits, gaining near a degree every 68 years, but toward the latter end will
prevail much more, because the nearer they incline the more forcibly they will
make way.

And so you see all things are like to return to what they were, viz. The
immortal souls of men to God, and the Universe in o the same Chaos; which as I
said formerly will abide a Chaos to all Eternity, unless God do divide it again
into a new World, and raise new Bodies for the Souls that have of long been in
being. At the latter end of this descent you shall have Christ descending in
the greatest Triumph, Glory, and Splendour, appearing in a body brighter than
the Sun: Here must needs happen a very great noise and thunder, when the
Elements do with the greatest force clash against one another, which cannot but
then strike the greatest amazement and anguish into the Ears of the Wicked.
This Doctrine may prove a plain Paraphrase upon those mysteries mentioned in
the Revelation of St. John: For instance Chap. 9. v. 1, 2. where a Star is
described to fall down from heaven, namely the Sun; opening the bottomless pit
and raising a smoke, viz through his burning and consuming rays, etc.

No wonder if men's fancies are so strongly missed in constructing the
obscurities of the late quoted Book of Divine Predictions; some imagining a
plenary abolition of the Elements, others their conversion into a hell for the
damned; some thence deducting Christ's Personal Reign before the consummation of
the World, others judging quite contrary; what strange phanatick deductions and
constructions do some Spirits suggest to themselves, expecting every moment a
subversion of the world! and alas God has ordained the World to run out its
natural course, which doubtless He will in no wise contradict; and how long
that is like to last may be infallibly proposed from what I have here stated,
where we cannot but note that all those depravate conceptions do derive from
men's ignorance in Philosophy and Nature, Gods great work.

But me thinks I see some ready to condemn me for stating assertions touching
things of the Divine Purpose, and such as God has reserved within himself; and
therefore none ought to dive into those secret Counsels.

I answer, That we are to make a search into all things as far as our parts
will bear us out in, and we are commanded so to do; because we may the more
admire God in all his Attributes.

2. God has given a man power of searching into all intelligible things, and
therefore ought to make the greatest use of it he can.

3. It is impossible for man, so much as to make an attempt to search into Gods
Secrets, because God has limited him with a finite power: So that there is
little fear that any should search into any such mysteries. But this by the way.

CHAP. XXIII. Of the Magnitude and distance of the Sun and Moon, and the motion
of the other Planets.
1. That the Magnitude of the Sun has not been probably, much loss certainly,
stated by any. The Arguments, vulgarly proffered for the proof of the Suns
Magnitude, rejected. 2. That the Sun might be capable enough of illuminating
the World were he much lesser than the terraqueous Globe than I suppose him to
be. 3. That the shadow of the Earth is to some extent Cylindrical. 4. That the
Sun existing in the Equator does at once illuminate the whole Hemisphere of
the Earth. 5. Concerning the diminution or increase of the shadow of the Earth
within the Polars, together with the cause of the Prolongation and Abbreviation
of the days. That the Sun is much bigger than he appears to be. 6. What the
spots of the Sun and Moon are, and their causes. 7. That the Arguments,
proposed by Astronomers for rendering the Moon lesser than the Earth, and
proving the distance of the Sun, are invalid. 8. That the Moon is by far lesser
than the Earth. 9. Several Phaenomena's of the Moon demonstrated. 10.
Concerning the motion of Venus and Mercury. 11. Of the motion of the fixed
Stars, and their Scintillation.


1. THe body of the Sun is by far exceeded in mole and bigness by the weighty
Globe; but before I insist upon the proof of this, I will repeat the Arguments
produced by those, who assert the Sun to be many times bigger than the said
Globe.

In the first place I must take notice of the great variance, which there is
between those great Coryphaeans in Astronomy touching the Magnitude of Stars,
many of them differing from each other in their compute 10, 12, or more
Diameters of the Earth, which is accounted but a slight disagreeance. Now if
these Grandees are disagreeing from one another in so many thousand Leagues in
defining the Magnitude of a Star, what shall we judge of their most certain (as
they pretend) demonstrations?

2. Let us examine their Instruments, whereby they aspire to fathom the body of
a Star; such are an Astrolabe, Semicircle, Quadrant, etc. These being divided
according to the proportion of 360 degr. contained in a Celestial Orb, are well
enough fitted to explain the number of such degrees, but then the difficulty
remains the same still, viz. What proportion a degree of Longitude in the
Heavens bears to any certain known Longitude of the Earth. Neither are they
wanting in this, asserting a degree of Longitude of the Solar Orb to be equal
to 15 German Leagues; because the Sun does remove the shadow of 15 Leagues from
the Earth through the progress of each degree. But suppose this were granted,
it follows that a degree of Longitude of the Solar Orb is equal to a degree
of Longitude of the Firmament; because the Firmament does likewise make 15
Leagues by its gradual progress, or how could it absolve its diurnal circuit in
24 hours? but this is false: So neither does the Sun's removal of the shadow
from the Earth infer the said proportion; because the Sun (according to their
Supposition,) far exceeding the earth in bigness, cannot describe a true and
equal Longitude of its progress upon the Earth, but only his light being
terminated by the Earth is alone denoted to vary its termination so many
Leagues by moving one degree.

3. If Astronomers do vary so much from one another in assigning the Earths
Longitude, whereunto we are so near, we have greater reason to suspect their
conclusions of the Stars their mensuration (which are so remote from us) to be
void of all foundation. Aristotle pronounced the Circumference of the
Terrestrial Globe to contain 50000 miles, assigning 1388/9 miles to every
degree. Hipparchus allowed 34625 miles responding in 96 ^^/7^ miles to every
degree. Eratosthenes stated 31500 miles, allowing 87 miles to a degree. Ptolomy
granted 22500. Alphraganus 204000. Fernelius 24514. Others who have sailed
about it state 190010 miles for the Circumference of the Earth. Judge what a
vast difference there is between them!

4. Another Argument proposed by them is, because the Suns absence or
opposition to us effects a conical shadow or darkness; Ergo the Sun must be
greater than the Earth. But how can the shadow be conical, since it drowns the
Moon (whose Diameter according to their own confession contains a 39th part of
the Diameter of the earth) which extends to a greater largeness than a Conical
Figure should do?

2. Were the shadow of the Earth Cylindrical, then they would confess the Sun
to be of an equal bigness with the earth; but that, they say, it is not; ergo.
I deny the Minor, and prove the contrary. The Sun existing in either of the
equinoctial points makes day and night equal the whole earth over; ergo the
shadow of the earth must be columnal, because the obverted surface of the earth
does clip or stop the light from the other opposite surface to the extent of
half the globe. Wherefore the terraqueous shadow of the one side of the earth,
being equal to the light of the other side, must needs be columnal. And
although this columnal shadow is not extended further than above half way to
the Region of the fiery element, where it begineth to be contracted and
gradually diminisht, yet that hinders not, but that the said shadow may be
columnal to some certain extent. If now the said shadow were conical, then the
Sun at once must illustrate more then the mediety of the Globe, and
consequently the nights would be shorter then the days, although under the
Line at the season of the AEquinoxe; but that is false; ergo. Again, were the
Sun greater than the Earth, ergo its heat would be communicated in an equal
violence upon all the parts of it; for why should it not as much power out
showers of heat conically, as you say it does its light? Here you cannot accur
to excuse your self by the distance or remoteness of the Sun, thence
contracting its heat; for then it must likewise contract its light.

3. They assert, supposing the shadow of the Earth to be conical, that
therefore the Sun must be necessarily greater. But for what reason? Not because
the Sun is greater, but because the light is larger: wherefore the largeness of
the light does not conclude any thing touching the bigness of the Sun. I not
the light of a Candle or Touch much larger than its flame? Is not the same
Candle apt to overcast an Object much bigger than it self with light that shall
exceed its mediety? and consequently the shadow of such a body must be conical.
Whence it is, that a body ten thousand times less than the air, is capable of
illuminating its whole tract, because a body of that proportion is big enough
to obtend the air throughout its whole depth. But if you should imagine with
the Peripateticks, that light is efficiently produced by the lucid substance of
the Sun (I know not how,) then indeed the body of the Sun must be many times
bigger than the earth, because the Lumen would be but just of the same extent
with the Lux. But I need not to answer to this, since the contrary has been
plainly proved. After all this, I state,

II. 1. That the Sun, were he so much lesser than the terraqueous globe, than I
suppose he is, would be big enough to illuminate its whole Hemisphere at once;
for if the light of a Candle does illuminate the air thirty leagues round, much
more would the Sun the whole Hemisphere, whose substance is by far more pure,
lucid, and bigger in that proportion in comparison with the aerial region, then
a focal light being of an impure, dark substance, is in comparison to the
Circumference of 30 Leagues.

III. 2. The shadow of the earth is to some extent cylindrical. I prove it; Is
not the shadow of a man standing in the Sun cylindrical to some extent? Is not
the shadow of a Pen or other small body, being held at some distance Otherwise
if held near to it, it is conical.
before a Candle (whose Lux is bigger than the body objected) cylindrical to
some extent? Besides, as I proved above, it is evident in the Equinoxes: The
reason is, because a dense body does obscure and dead the light as far as it is
dense; now the earth being dense all about the entire Horizon, no wonder if it
does dead and obscure the Suns light to the extent of its Hemisphere.

IV. 3. The Sun existing in the Equinoctial, does at once illuminate the whole
Hemisphere of the earth from one Pole to the other. If the Sun existing in the
Meridian, is seen at once by those under the torrid Zone from the Ascension of
the Equator, that are 90 degrees off Eastward, and as many Westward from its
Descension; then the Sun must also be seen as many degr. off to the Southward
as to the Northward, that is to each Pole, because the Sun being globous, does
obtend the air equally about to all the parts of the Compass. But the Sun in
the Meridian is seen at one time by those that are 90 degr. Eastward or
Westward; ergo.

V. 4. By so many degrees as the Sun declineth to the North, by so many degrees
does a perfect shadow or darkness cover the South polar Earth; and the like
conceive of the South Declination.

5. The Suns gradual declination causes a prolongation or abbreviation of its
diurnal light and shadow, or the equality and inequality of the days and
nights.

6. The Sun is much greater than he appears to be, because the clouds and
depth of the air do diminish its species, in the manner of a great fire
appearing but like a small spark at a great distance. Astronomers are not only
forward in prescribing the bigness of the Stars, but also their distances; And
how is that possible, since they cannot sensibly demonstrate the Diameter of
the World, or define any certain extent in the Heavens for to compare another
Terrestrial length unto? neither can they ever find out an exact account of any
length upon the Earth responding to a degree of any of the Orbs of Heaven: If
so, what do all their observations touching the Stars Paralaxis amount unto?

VI. The body of the Sun is usually expressed as resembling a man's face, whose
Marks and Signatures are nothing else but certain protuberancies and spots; The
like is apparent in the Moons face. These protuberancies are nothing but
inequalities of their cloudy bodies appearing like unto clouds in the air,
thicker or more compact in one place, and thinner and looser in another. The
Telescopium or Prospective Glass discerns those spots to be moveable: and not
unlikely, since they, being the external parts of those gross and looser
clouds, are apt to be displaced and change their situation through the
obtrusion befalling them by the most rapid motion of the Heavens. These do
sometimes increase and accrease either through dispersion or apposition of new
clouds floating here and there in the Planets their way as they move, which often
causes a distinction of their bigger or lesser appearance at some times than at
others.

VII. The Moon is by all Astronomers believed to be less than the terrestrial
globe, because the shadow of the eclipse of the Sun is much too little to
obtenebrate all the Earth. But supposing the Sun to be of so inapparent a
bigness and distance from the Earth as the vulgar of Astronomers do receive him
to be of, and the Moon to be of a far greater distance from the Earth than she
is, certainly the shadow, which she would cast must be much less than her body,
although it were forty times bigger than it is, because the Sun being greater
than she must according to the ordinary Doctrine of shadows only suffer her to
cast a conical shadow, whose extreme point not reaching to the Earth, or if it
did, could not be a certain token, whence to draw the proportion or distance of
Stars. Wherefore according to their own principles, the Moon may be conceived
to exceed the Earth far in bigness, since they cannot attain to any probable
account of the distances of the Stars.

2. We must also suppose the Moon to be a lucid body, (although yielding to the
Sun in that particular) and therefore to illuminate the Earth somewhat; for
otherwise in every total perfect Eclipse it would prove as dark as pitch; if
so, what ground does there remain to take measure of her shadow, since her
light, (or shadow, that is a lesser light in comparison to that of the Sun)
does according to our rule of light extend to a far greater bigness than her
self is? Whence it appears, that for all their Mathematical Demonstrations the
Moon may be bigger or lesser than the Earth.

VIII. However the Moon is by far lesser than the Earth; because of its small
light, which it casts, and other reasons produced from the minorating of the
Sun, which do likewise conclude the Moon to be lesser than the Sun, but bigger
than any of the other Stars. The Moon is the lowest of all the Stars; because
she is the least lucid of any, and consequently must be most terrestrial and
aqueous, through which principles she must doubtless yield to be lowest
depressed by the fiery Region, in that manner as I have formerly setdown.

2. Because she moves the quickest (or in another sense the slowest, as you may
read before) through the Zodiac, which must needs suppose the Circumference of
her Circuit to be the least.

3. Because she cannot be seen, unless at a nearer distance than the others may.



IX. The Moon through her diurnal course from East to. West absolves no more
than 346 degrees. 49 min. 24 sec. 58 third. 52 four. 38 fif. that is, is so much
retarded viz. as there are restant degrees. from 346 degrees. 49 min. etc. to 360 degr.
, or is moved so much slower than the fiery Region: So that in 27 days, 7
hours, 43 min. 5 sec. 8 th. she is retarded 360 degrees. or the extent of a whole
Circle. She is in the same manner, as we have proposed concerning the Sun,
shoved from North to South, and from South back to North a degree and some
minutes every day, her greatest declination being 28. degrees. 30 min. and her
greatest Latitude 5 degrees. But you must not apprehend, although I say, that
the Moon is removed from the Ecliptic 5 degrees. that therefore she is seated 5
degrees beyond the Sun, notwithstanding her greatest digression from the
Ecliptic, yet she is and appears nearer to the Equinoctial bbbb than he:
Suppose one standing upon the surface of the Earth any where between m and p; I
say that the Moon existing in the Merid. eq; and in her greatest Latitude near
e, viz. from the Ecliptic, is and appears nearer to the Equinoctial bbbb, than
the Sun does in o, because the Line from o to b is longer, than from the Center
of the Moon near e o b. Whence you may conceive, that the Moon is nearer to the
Lquinoctial, although seated beyond the Ecliptic.

2. That the degrees of the Orb of the Moon are so much less proportionally, as
the Orb of the Moon is less than the Orb of the Sun. But to pursue the Moons
Motion into Latitude: Star-Gazers do observe her to appear sometimes higher and
low in her Perigao and Apogaeo; Not because of her Epicycle, but because of
the Aspect of the Sun, which does sometimes reflect its light stronger upon
her, and so makes her to seem higher That is, remoter.
, besides the medium of the air being by means of that Aspect so attenuated But
accidentally, by expelling those vapors that incrassate it.
, it must needs produce a prolongation of the object, like to a thin Glass
representing the object to be much farther distant than it is. As the said
attenuation renders an object more distant, so it renders it also less, whence
it is that the Moon appears lesser in her pro longation. That the moves
swifter sometimes than other times is likewise a mere appearance, happening
through the extension and prolongation of the object and Medium: So on the
contrary the incrassation of the air through the remoteness of the Sun causes
the Moon to seem to move slower, and to be bigger and nearer; as when she is in
her Perigaeo. The same happens, when we see through a thick Glass, or in
looking upon an object through the water, seeming nearer and bigger, and to
move slower. I am not to describe you here the meaning of Solar and Lunar
Eclipses, alone the cause of their variation: viz. depending upon the
difference of declination in the Sun, and of declination and latitude in the
Moon; for he being constantly in making his progress cannot be ever met or
overtaken by the Moon at the same place and time.

X. Venus and Mercury are the two Pages of the Sun, neither of them being much
distant from him. Both are much wanting in bigness of the Moon. Their motion
from West to East is near upon the same with that of the Sun. And so is their
motion into Latitude depending likewise upon the same impelling cause, only
they are observed to wheel round about the Sun: to wit, Mercury in the space of
three months, and Venus within eight, in the manner represented within the
apposed Scheme. Their impulse about the Sun is thus; The Sun casting its fiery
rays round like to a squib, raises and commotes all the fiery clouds about
him, which reaching in a greater force to those that are nearer adjacent, must
needs cause a swifter circulation, than to those of a more remote distance;
whence it is, that Mercury absolves his circular course about the Sun in a less
time by far than Venus.

I shall spend no more time in discoursing upon the motion of the three
superior Planets, since their motion and manner of it may easily be
apprehended by what has been proposed.

XI. What concerns the constant, equal, and ranked motion of the fixed Stars,
it is to be attributed to the cohesion or linking of those equal large clouds
of the second Region of fire, wherein the said Lights are fixed, moving them
equally and constantly in that fixation.

Their Scintillation is nothing else but their flames quavering upon the
obtended air, happening through their recurrent motion, or quavering accurss to
one another.

AN APPENDIX Of Problems resolved by our Principles.
CHAP. I. Problems relating to the Earth.
1. Why two weighty bodies are not moved downwards in parallel Lines. 2. Why a
great Stone is more difficultly moved on the top of a high hill than below. 3.
Why a pair of Scales is easier moved empty than balanced. 4. Whence it is
that a man may carry a greater weight upon a VVheelbarrow than upon his back.
5. Why a weighty body is easier thrust forward with a Pole, than immediately
by ones arms: besides 5 other Probl. more. 6. Why a stick thrust into a hole
if bended is apt to be broke near the hole. What the cause of the relaxation
of a bowed stick is. 7. Whether Gold does attract Mercury. 8. Why the herb of
the Sun, vulgarly called Chrysanthemum Peruvianum, obverteth its leaves and
flowers to the Sun wheresoever he be. 9. Why the Laurel is seldom or never
struoken by Lightning.


I. WHy are not two or more weights depressed down to the Earth in parallel
lines, but in flead thereof come nearer and nearer to one another the lower
they descend?

Answ. Because all weighty bodies are depressed downwards by the sinking down
of the air for its center, which tending directly from the Circumference
thither, does also direct the said weights to the same terminus ad quem; thus,
Suppose three Plummets to hang down from l p l, their motion would not be
directed in parallel Lines in the manner as from m p m to c d c, but would tend
to f d f, and being let down lower would all meet at the Center (imagine of the
terraqueous Globe d b b b) a, because of the said motion of the air. Likewise
supposing three light bodies to be moved upwards from s r s, they would not be
parallelly moved to k i k, but from s r s toward the Circumference to h i h,
Because the motion of the air tends directly from the Center to the
Circumfeence.

II. It is confirmed by many trials, that a great stone is more difficultly
moved on the plain of the top of a high hill, than on the plain of a low level
ground; And that a great mass of any Mineral may be easier rouled out of its
place deep in the Mines by one, than by three or four on the Surface of the
earth. You demand the reason.

I answer, That the air being more forcible (as we have showed before) on the
tops of hills, does more potently depresse the stone against the plain of the
hill, and so detains it there; no wonder then if it prove so slow in motion.
Likewise is the air of a greater energy on the Surface than deep under the
earth, where it is discontinuated by weighty minims forced out of the earths
bowels in expelling the perigrin air, whose contiguous depression (to wit of
the air, being discontinuated by the said weighty minims) does also contribute
much to the rouling of a Mineral, because we roll a weighty body by depressing
it against the ground, in which action our force is not only strengthened, but
the weighty body is also impelled forward (but by refraction) by the aid of the
said weighty minims.

Here you may reply, That the air does also depress the body downwards, and
consequently detain it.

I answer, (Besides what I have stated in the solution of the six Problems at
the 3 Art.) that as far as the air is continuous, and so depresseth a body, it
does detain it within its continuity, but being rendered contiguous by the
discontinuating weighty minims grants passage to any impelled body. The first
part of the Solution is apparent in drawing any weighty body under water
through it, where you may perceive a very forcible detention by reason of the
continuity of the parts of the water; the latter in drawing it through fire.
What concerns Dr. Gilberts Magnetic Effluvia, and Monsieur Gassendy his rigid
Cords or Hooks, which are by some borrowed to explain the differences of
intention of Gravity, are sutil, since they are only pulled out of their
Phanfies without any probable proof for either.

III. The precedent Solution may also be applied to this Problem, viz. Why a
pair of Scales are easier moved being empty, than when balanced by equal
weights.

IV. Whence is it, that a man may carry a greater weight upon a Wheelbarrow
than upon his back?

I answer, Because in carrying a weight upon a Wheelbarrow he only thrusts it
forward, and is assisted by the contiguous pressure of the air, qualified as we
have proposed in the 2 Problem.

2. Because the Wheel being circular is easily propelled. A circular body is
easier propelled, because it is thrust forward upon single points, which it is
certain yield obedience with the least resistance to the force impelling.

3. Because of the reason of the fifth Problem.

V. A man impelling a weighty body from him, shall easier impel it by making
use of a Pole to thrust it forwards, than if he tumbled it along with his arms
only; whence it is, that they usually affix a long Iron handle to those great
rouling stones, that are used in Gardens for to even the ground.

2. One shall cast a stone further with a sling, than without it.

3. Likewise a stroke given with a hammer with a long handle, is much more
forcible, than if made by one with a short handle; or striking with a long
handled hammer, the stroke shall be of a greater force if held by the farther
end of it, than if otherwise taken hold nearer to the hammer.

4. A cuff given with a swing of ones arm, makes by far a greater impression
than a thump.

5. A stick is easier broken upon ones knee the farther the hands are removed
from it To wit, from the knee.
; and the harder, the nearer they are applied.

6. The longer an Oar is, the swifter the vection of the Boat is, although
impelled with the same force that a shorter may be. All these being
Problematically proposed are resolved by one and the same answer: viz.
Supposing the air to press so potently downwards, I say, that it being shoven
and elevated before at the body propelled, (supposing it also to be continuous,
and consequently not complicable, that is contiguously introceding, as I have
told you before,) is forced to rise up, and to sink down again behind at the
place, out of which it was propelled but the instant before, where through that
violent and most swift descent and refraction against the body of the Propulsor
and of the backward air, must needs shove hard between the body propelled, and
the propulsor, and backward air, and so by that means must add a great force to
the impulse of the said weighty body.



Thus, suppose this round stone to be impelled from d d d into a a a, doubtless
that air, now dispossessed of a a a must be risen up into b b b, and sink or
shove down refracted into d d d and e e e, to wit, between the Impulsor and
back air f f f f, and between the Impulsor and the stone, which must
necessarily superadd to the impulse of the Impulsor at d d d, and add no less
to the intending of the strength of the propulsor at e e e, impelling the said
propulsor much stronger forward, than his own or animal force could move him:
Which has often occasioned me to conclude with my self, that the strength or
swiftness of a man, in impelling or running without the supposed assistance and
impulse of the air, is at least one third or more less than it seems; because
he can scarce sustain two thirds of that weight upon his back or less, that he
can drive forward. This resolves us, why a man or a horse cannot stay
themselves in their full course or running; because the air being in a
commotion, does not desist from impelling the said running bodies forwards,
before it is gradually reduced to a remission and rest from that violent motion.

This premitted I say, 2. That the more or the greater body of air is moved by
the greater or longer impelled body, the stronger, swifter, and easier the said
greater or longer body must be impelled. Hence we must also deduce the reason,
why a body being already in motion, is easier moved forwards, than one that is
at rest.

3. I say that a Globous Body is easiest impelled, because the Air meeting with
no resistance or stay by Angles, slides quicker over it, and consequently
drives the faster: besides an angular Body having many plain sides, (breaking
the force of the Air,) does not force the air so much as a globous body, that
inverting the air quite contrary into a circular Figure upwards, (whereas
naturally it striveth in a circular Figure downwards,) whereby the Air is much
irritated and intended in its force. Why an angular Body resists an impulse
stronger, is, because the Air in depressing downwards takes faster hold of it
in pressing upon its Plane, being thereby and its angles hindered or cut off
from sliding off, as appears in the quadrangular stone exhibited in this
apposed Scheme, where you may plainly see the difference of the figures of the
air in its elevation by bodies of various figures.

Here may be objected against these subconclusions, that the air, were it of
that force, as to superadd so much to the impulsor and impulse, would evidently
press down the loose Coat of the driver, and be plainly felt by him. Touching
the force of the air, no doubt but it is very great, according to the commotion
and irritation thereof, as appears in expelling the flame out of a Gun; in
bursting thick Glass bottels, etc. 2. It does not press down the loose garments
of the impulsor, because they are supported by air underneath, and being very
pervious, and therefore not resisting gives passage to their meeting. 3. Its
force is not felt, because it is equal and presses the propulsor forward with
a gradual, equal and smooth force.

VI. Why is a Stick being thrust some part of it into a Hole apter to be broke
near the Hole, if bended, than any where else?

I Answer, that through the bending of the Stick, the moveable parts of it,
viz. the air, water and fire that are perfused within throughout its Pores, are
compressed toward the other end, where being stopped through the compression of
the sides of the Hole, do tumefie the Stick there, whereby together with the
continuation of the force bending it is disrupted. The said Spirits recurring
in a Stick bowed only, and not broken, cause the relaxation of the inflexion,
forcing the solid parts of the Stick into their pristine position by their
return.

VII. Whether Gold does attract Mercury?

Answ. The Vulgar imagines it to be so; because a piece of Gold being held in
a Patients Mouth, that is a salivating, or lately has salivated by Mercurials,
is changed white through its attracting the Mercury. But how should it attract;
by its Volatick Spirits possibly? No certainly; for the whole Rabble of
Chemical Vulcans finds its Spirits to be fixed beyond those of all other
Bodies. How then? Not by acting a distanti; Ergo it is fallacious, that Gold
attracts Mercury, and more probable, that the spirits of Mercury being
ordinarily termed fugitive, cannot be coagulated or collected, but by the
densest body, whence it is that only Gold does collect and coagulate its
spirits about its Surface.

VIII. Why does the Herb of the Sun vulgarly called Chrysantemum Peruvianum, or
Crowfoot of Peru, (because its Leaves and Flowers resemble those of our
Crowfoot) turn the faces of its Leaves and Flowers about with the Sun?

Answ. Because the Sun through its igneous Beams does rarefie that side of the
Leaves and Flowers which is obverted to it, whereby he does expel their
continuous streams, whose egress does attract or incline them that way whither
they are expelled, in the same manner as we have explained the Attraction of
the Loadstone.

IX. Why is the Laurel seldom or never struck by Lightning?

Answ. Because it is circumvested with a thick slimy Moisture, which does
easily shove or slide off the Glance of a Lightning.

CHAP. II. Containing Problemes relating to Water.
1. Why is red hot Iron rendered harder by being quenched in cold water? 2.
Whence is it there falls a kind of small Rain every day at noon under the
AEquinoctial Region? 3. How Glass is made. 4. Whence it is that so great a Mole
as a Ship yields to be turned by so small a thing as her Rudder. 5. What the
cause of a Ships swimming upon the water is. 6. Whether all hard waterish
bodies are freed from fire.


I. Why is red hot Iron rendered harder by being quenched in cold water?

Answ. Because the water does suddenly pierce into the Pores of iron, being now
open, and violently expel the fire and air, (both which, as we have showed in
B. 1. Part 2. are the sole Causes of the softness of a body,) and being
expelled, leave the same indurated by the weighty Elements pressing more
forcibly and harder to their Center.

II. Whence is it, that there falls a kind of small Rain every day from 11 or 12
of the Clock to 2 or 3 in the Afternoon, under the AEquinoctial Region?

Answ. The Sun at his Rising and Descending, does through his oblique Rays
excite a multitude of small vapors, which through the privative coldness of
the air in the night are concreased into small clouds, but reduced into drops
of rain through the Suns rarefaction or fiery minims when he is perpendicularly
imminent upon them.

III. How is Glass made?

Answ. The matter of ordinary Glass is generally known to be Ashes, or Chalck
burnt out of stones, or both.

The Venice Glasses, differing from others in clearness and transparency, are
made out of chalck burnt out of stones, which they fetch from Pavia by the
River Ficinum, and the ashes of the weed Kall, growing in the deserts of Arabia
between Alexandria and Rossetta, which the Arabians make use of for fuel. In
the first Book, second Part, I have told you, how a body was reduced into ashes
through the expulsion of its thinner glutinous moisture by the vibrating fiery
minims. The same fire being intended does through its greater violence enter,
mollify, diduct, and thence melt and equallize the courser thick remaining
glutinous moisture by its own presence together with the air, which it imports
along with it, whereby the Terrestial minims, that were before clotted, are
exactly and equally spread throughout the foresaid thick glutinous moisture.
The fire and air being only admitted from without, and not incorporated with
the said bodies through want of a matrix, and because they being in that
extreme overpowring quantity, that they may as easily free themselves from the
said body, as they entered, are expelled again as soon as they are exposed to
the cold ambient air, and so desert the body, leaving it glib, smooth,
continuously hard, friable, rigid, and transparent. So that it appears hence,
that Glass is nothing but water reduced nearer to its absolute nature, (which
we have showed is hard and clear,) by freeing it from the thin glutinous
moisture (or air and fire incorporated with a small proportion of water)
through barning its first subject into ashes, and afterward by uniting,
diducting, and equallizing its own parts contained in the ashes. By the
forementioned thick or course glutinous moisture I intend a mixture of much
water incorporated with a little earth, and least air and fire. That Glass is
water nearer reduced to its absolute nature I shall prove by its properties.

1. That glib smoothness of Glass depends upon the continuity of the parts of
water, necessarily accompanied by a glib smoothness, because it does not
consist of any contiguous rough minims.

2. It is continuously hard, because water of her absolute nature is
continuously hard.

3. It is friable, because the water is throughout divided by the minims of
earth, which render it so brittle and rigid; whereas were it all water, it
would be harder than any stone: It is transparent, because it is but little
condensed by earth, whose condensation renders all bodies obscure.

2. Because it is luminous, that is, apt to receive the lumen from any lucid
body, as being throughout porous, through which it is rendered capable of
harboring the obtended air.

Glass is distinguished from Crystallin hardness and transparency, because this
latter appropriates more of water in her absolute state, and less of earth.

IV. Whence is it, that so great a mole as a Ship yields so readily in turning
or winding to so small a thing as a Rudder? This Problem will make plain, that
an impulse is intended by a medium, or deferens.

A Ship swimming in the water, and being impelled by the wind or a board-hook,
raises the water into a tumor before at her bows, which is violently
impelled, what by the air lifted up by the tumor, what by her own bent to
recover that place behind at the stern, whence it was first propelled, (and
where you shall always observe a hollowness in the water, proportionable to
her rising before,) and therefore, as you may see, runs swiftly about both the
sides, and meeting in both the streams abaft does propel the Ship forward by a
reflection; and this you may also perceive in taking notice of that most eager
meeting of the streams of water from both sides behind at the Rudder, which
being removed to either side, viz. To Star-boord, or Lar-boord side, directs
the Ship toward the sides; because the force of the water in returning does
beat hard against that side of the Rudder, which is obverted to her, as
resisting most and collecting her force is shoved toward the opposite side of
the Stern, whereby her head comes too to the other side; whence we may plainly
observe, that a Ship does not begin to turn before, but always abaft. This I
prove, A Ship hitting her breech against the ground at Sea usually strikes
abaft, because she draws more water there than before; now the shoving of the
Helm to the other side brings her off immediately, and brings her head too;
which is a certain sign, that a Ship is moved from abaft, and begins first to
turn there. If it is so, it is beyond doubting, that the force of the water is
forcible behind beyond imagination, and thence adding that intention to the
impulse.

V. What is the cause of the swimming of a Board or Ship upon the water?

Because the water being continuously thick coheres together and will not
suffer her self to be divided, whereby they happen to be lifted up by the water.

VI. Whether all hard waterish bodies are freed from fire?

No, For although a slame is extinguished by them, yet that hinders not, but
that fire may be contained within them in particles, and close shut up between
their pores; This appears in Crystal, which being smartly struck by another
hard body, does emit sparks of slaming fire from it, like unto a Flint. So
neither is Ice it self bare within its pores of some small particles of fire.

CHAP. III. Comprizing Problems touching the Air.
1. Whether Air be weighty. 2. Whether a Bladder blown up with wind be heavier
than when empty. 3. Why water contained in a beer glass, being turned round
with ones hand, does turn contrary against the motion of the Glass. 4. Why a
breath being blown with a close mouth does feel cool, and efflated with a
diducted mouth feel warm. 5. Why an armed point of an Arrow grows hot in
being shot through the air. 6. Why Beer or Wine will not run out of the Cask
without opening a hole atop. 7. What difference there is between an Oricane and
a Travada. 8. Whether it be true that Winds may be hired from Witches or
Wizards in Iseland. 9. Why is it quieter in the night than in the day?


I. Whether Air be weighty?

Answ. Air considered as enjoying its Center, is light and does not participate
of any weight, since it would only move from the Center to the Circumference,
and ever force extraneous bodies upwards; Ergo Air absolutely conceived is only
light. 2. Air in its present state is also weighty (but accidentally only, and
not essentially,) because of its sinking downwards toward the Center.

II. Whether a Bladder blown up with wind be heavier than when empty?

Answ. There has been trial made of this (to wit, of the weight of a bladder
blown up by Bellows atop of a high hill) in a pair of Scales, and it was found
that an empty bladder weighed heavier than one filled with wind; the same is
also deprehended by casting them both into the water, where we shall find the
empty bladder first to be equal with the Surface of the water, and afterward
to sink down a little, whereas the windy one swimmeth atop. The cause is, by
reason a bladder extended by the air within is supported by it, and being
rendered more porous and subtle through its obduction the air does easily pass
without any resistance, and therefore does not depress it so much as an empty
bladder, which through its corrugation and lesser diduction is more dense, and
therefore receiving the depressing force of the air much stronger, besides
being more acute, is apter for to cut through the inferior air; whereas a
bladder blown up is obtuse and does as it were swim in the air: But if a
bladder be blown up with ones breath, then doubtless it will prove heavier than
an empty one, because of the vaporous or heavy waterish air contained within.

III. Why does the water, contained in a beer glass being turned round with
your hand, turn contrary against the motion of the glass; the same is observed
in rouling a barrel full of water, where the liquor turns contrary against the
barrel?

Ans. The water is here detained flat, or held fast by the air sinking down,
whence it is, that the water seems to move against the motion of the Vessel,
being glib, or slippery and smooth, and therefore not detaining the vessel in
its motion.

IV. Why does a breath being blown with a close mouth feel cool, and efflated
with a diducted mouth feel warm?

Answ. Because the breath or incrassated air of a close mouth is more united
and longer continuated, whereby it does vigorously puff the ambient air, whose
compression felt, causes cold, as I have explained it in Book 1. Part 2. Now
through the union of the incrassated air that is efflated, the hot minims of
the breath are deeply and equally impressed into the substance of the vaporous
air, whence their virtue is also suppressed; but in breathing of the said air
out of an open mouth the fiery minims do come forth in troops unequally and but
superficially mixed in or supported by the said incrassated air, whence they
abide energick; besides the air being but little puffed makes little or no
compression: Hence you may also collect a reason, why the air does refrigrate
being agitated with a Fan.

V. Why does an armed point of an Arrow grow hot in being shot through the air?

Answ. Because its body and pores are somewhat opened by the air grinding
against it, whereby its fiery parts procure an occasion of being unired and
condensed. This does also resolve us, why a Knife being smartly whetted emits
sparks of fire; or why a Flint being struck hard against a piece of Steel does
likewise sparkle fire from it, viz. because its solid parts are opened and
disjoined through the concussion, whereby the fiery minims happen to be united
and condensed. Likewise many cold bodies by being chawed or contrited do
afterward grow hot.

VI. Why will not Beer or Wine run out of the Cask without opening a hole atop?

Answ. Because of the continuous adhesion, or cohesion of the continuous parts
of the liquor to the continuous parts of the Cask; but as soon as it is
averruncated, divided, and impelled downwards by the air entering at the upper
hole, it runs freely out of the Tap. That it is the air entering atop which
presses out the liquor is apparent by the cavity atop, which the fore-impulse
of the air entering causes.

VII. What difference is there between an Oricane and a Travada.

Answ. An Oricane is usually much more violent, and therefore also much less
lasting, bursting down circularly from all parts like to a Whirlwind. A Travada
is more lasting and less violent, and erupts directly down, from one tract, and
in no wise circularly, which as it often rages upon the Seas off the shores of
Coramandel, Manicongo, Guiny, etc. so the former is more frequent in the
West-Indian Climates.

VIII. Whether it be true, that Winds may be hired from Witches or Wizzards in
Iseland?

Answ. It is certain, that the Winds blow very variously and manifold about
that Island, insomuch that it is not rare to see Ships sailing several courses
at once, all of them being equally favored by a good wind. The cause of this
being vulgarly not known, has occasioned people to brand the old men and women
there with Witchcraft, whom the roughness of the air may cause to look rugged
like the devils correspondents, selling the winds by retail. The causes of this
variety are great winds, erupting often out of several holes of the earth about
the Island, especially about the Mount Hecla, which many believe to be the
mouth of hell, because of those prodigious thunders and murmurings of winds
that are perceived thereabout.

IX. Why is it quieter in the night than in the day?

Answ. Because in the day the air being fluid and continuous is agitated into
waves by the Suns fiery beams, whose bodies clashing together cause a small
noise in the day, which the night season is freed of.

CHAP. IV. Containing Problems touching the fire.
1. Why does water cast upon unquencht chalk or lime become boiling. 2. Why
does common salt make a cracking noise, when cast into the fire. 3. Who were
the first inventers of Gunpowder. 4. What are the Ingredients of Gunpowder. 5.
Whence arrives all that flaming fire, that follows the kindling of
Gunpowder. 6. Whence is it that Gunpowder being kindled in Guns erupts with
that force and violence?


I. Why does water cast upon unquencht chalk or lime become boiling?

Answ. Because fire in lime is detained or imprisoned within a thick glutinous
moisture, which being attenuated through the thinner moisture of water, is
forced to suffer the igneous parts before dispersed and imprisoned to unite,
whence being condensed and encompassed by a thin glutinous air is changed into
a hidden flame, whereby the water is rendered boiling hot.

II. Why does common salt make a cracking noise, when cast into the fire?

Answ. Because the flaming fire exufflating the spirituous air of the salt
within its body, does also force it to burst out, the report whereof is not
unlike to a cracking noise.

III. Who were the first inventers of Gunpowder?

Answ. In the first place touching the dispute, whether the invention of it is
to be adscribed to the Chinese or the Europeans, it is very probable, the
Chinese were the first Authors of Gunpowder, because they were found
practicing upon it at the same time that it was first invented in Europe. Next,
who was the Author of it among the Europeans is uncertain, but certain, that he
was a German, whose name some would call Berthold Swarts a Monck of Friburg,
said to have found it out accidentally, by leaving a mixture of Saltpeter and
Sulphur in a Mortar, covered with a stone, whereinto a spark of the candle
lighting by chance, forced the stone up with no small report; from this he was
also supposed to have taken the fabric of a Gun.

IV. What are the ingredients of Gunpowder?

Answ. Its materials are ordinarily Saltpeter, Sulphur, and dust of Charcoal:
All which being very igneous do very much intend one another force in blowing
up a fire.

V. Whence arrives all that flaming fire, that follows the kindling of
Gunpowder?

Ans. The Saltpeter, which is the chiefest of the ingredients, consisting of
very weighty dense and waterish parts, contains a great proportion of fiery
minims within its body, but dispersed through those weighty parts and
suppressed by them; these being somewhat diducted and opened through the
rarefying and expanding virtue of an external actual flaming fire, give
occasion to the fiery minims interwoven with incrassated air to unite, and
through the compression of the weighty parts to be condensed, whence erupting
into the air does attract other fire latent (or rather is forced to it by the
accurss of the ambient air) and dispersed throughout the air, whereby its flame
is much amplified and continuated; for it seems very improbable, that so much
fire should have been latent in the Gunpowder as the flame requires.

2. The dilatation of the said erupting flame is also attenuated by the accurss
of the air, expanding the thick and course erupting flame gradually into a
thinner larger flame; whence it is that the flame near where the Powder was
kindled appears dusky red, and further off light and flashy.

VI. Whence is it, that Gunpowder being kindled in Guns erupts with that force
and violence?

Answ. The Powder being kindled into a flame at the Touchhole, divides or
discontinuates the air more than any other body imaginable, whereunto the air
accurrs from all parts, especially from above, with the greatest velocity and
force, for to expel the flame, which being propagated further, partly by its
own force, partly by the intrusion of the air, causes a more violent
discontinuation of air within being pent up, whereunto again a greater power of
air accedes from without and attenuates the flame within, whereby together with
the compression of the sides of the Gun, and the great access of air from
without the flame is violently expelled, effecting a great report through its
disrupting and pluffing of the air.

Here observe, 1. How the flame is augmented within the Gun; not by a vertual
rarefaction, as if the parts of the Gunpowder could be augmented without access
of other matter from without; for that would suppose either a Vacuum, and a new
creation of parts, or a penetration, and an annihilation of foregoing parts.
Wherefore, I say, it is augmented by attracting fire out of the acceding air;
and secondly, by being attenuated and diducted into a large flame by the parts
of the irrupting air.

2. That it is the air entering at the touchhole, that does expel the flame,
is evident.

1. Because the air is shut out before by the bullet and tow.

2. The touchhole being stopped at the next instant after the Powder begins to
kindle, the flame is immediately suppressed and extinguished, or at least
bursleth up behind. Whence it does appear, that it is the air entering does
attenuate (vulgarly termed rarefie) and expand the flame, which the advenient
fire does augment; and that the said air does expel the flame out at the
muzzel.

3. That the air does make use of the weighty minims of the saltpeter in
compressing and expelling the flame outward.

4. Why is a hot glass bursted by casting a drop of cold water upon it?

Answ. Because the fiery minims contained within its pores are condensed and
violently compressed by the gravity of the water, whereby they are forced to
disrupt the glass.

Why does a wooden Arrow, being shot out of a Gun, pierce deeper than an Iron
one?

Answ. Because the wooden one gives way into it self, or shrinks as it makes a
hole, whence being rendered lesser passes the easier through: whereas an Iron
one is stubborn, and is rather somewhat flatned against the body aimed at,
whence being rendered more obtuse and bigger at the point, is hindered in
penetrating.

Labor and constantia.
