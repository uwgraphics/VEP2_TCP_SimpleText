The Merry MAN'S Resolution Or a LONON Frollick.
He goes a wooing yet the matters so,
He cares not much whether he speeds or no,
Cause City Wives and Wenches are so common
He thinks it hard to find an honest woman
Ben't angry with this fellow I protest
That many a true word has been spoke in jest,
By degrees he lays a wager money's scant
Until five shillings out, then ends his Rant.
The Tune is much in Request, I Will hold thee five shillings.


IF young Men and Maidens
will listen a while
I Will sing you a Sonnet
will make you to smile
Then come my own Dearest
and be not so coy,
Whatever thou fear
i will get thee a boy.
I Will hold thee a six pence
it is silver complete
If thou art but willing
I can do the feat.
Then be not so scornful
b^t loving anti Kind
If thou will but kiss me
i will tell thee my mind
For I am a Gallant
that is versed in the trade
I know what belongs to
Wife, Widow and Maid
I Will hold thee a willing
as round as a King
Those Lasses that kiss well
loves the rather thing.
Then dear let me feel if
thy flesh it be warm
For I vow and protest I
will to thee no harm,
But buddle and cuddle
weel toy and weell kiss
What hurt honest Neighbors
can come of all this
I Will hold you three six-pences
in ready Coin
Most G^^is when they are pleased
with young men will join.
BUt when they are sullin
nere matter't a pin,
But touze um and touz um
twill please um again
And when you have done it,
this story is true
If you do but kiss um
they will straight ways kiss you
I Will hold you two shillings
lay with me that can
The fairest ^th Nation
will lie with a man.
Then why should young Females
continue sonice,
When Ladies of pleasure
do count it no vice
To be kind to their Neighbors
as well as the rest
For kissing and Courting
is still in request,
I Will hold two and six pence
that is just half a crown
Highest Girls in all Europe.
are easiest blown down.
To talk of Complexions
too tedious it were,
Or to know their conditions
by th'colour of hair,
Yet this i will assure you,
either Black, Red or Brown
When they are in the humor
theyl freely ly down
I Will hold you three shillings
who against me dare lay
That Women delight much
with young men to play.
There Is Mary and Betty,
with Nancy and Jone,
They Will lie with a Tinker
ere they will lie alone,
There Is Peg, Dol and Bridget
Rebecca and Kate
They laugh when they hear ont
but long till they hav't
I Will hold thee three and six pence
Maids love Men the best
When they come a wooing
in earnest not felt.
Fine Susan and Sarah
brave Lasses indeed
Yet they will lie with a Broom man
if they stand in need,
Likewise pretty Parnel
and simpering Sisse
When young men embrace them
how kindly they kiss
I Will hold you four shillings
the nicest that be
At one time or other
makes use of a P --
Then bear be contented
for thou shall have one,
And shall be prevented
of lying alone:
For I Am stout and lusty
and fit for delight
I Will hug thee and Kiss thee
ten times in a night
I Will hold four and six pence
I Will hold thee no less
I Will here a hole through thy coat
then by guess.
For I am an Archer,
Well skilled in that Art
Though I shoot at young Damsels
they nere feel it smart
I Will hold thee five shillings,
i will hold thee no more.
I Will bore a hole through thy smock
even before.
This song throughout England
on purpose I send
To make young men merry,
and there is an end.
Printed for J. Williamson at the Bible in Canon street and on London Bridge.
