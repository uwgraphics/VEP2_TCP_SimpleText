Great YORK and Albany: OR THE Loyal Welcome to His ROYAL HIGHNESS on His Return
from SCOTLAND.
To the Tune of, Hey Boys up go We.
^Now now the Zealots all must droop, the Synagogues shall down, and Truth and
Loyalty get up, ^The Pillars of the Throne, The Whigs, (who Loyalty forsook,)
shall with one Voice agree, ^To welcome home the Mighty Duke of YORK and ALBANY.

[2]
Behold with what a Glorious Train
Of Noble Lords and Peers,
Great York is Guarded over the Main,
In spite of all our Fears;
Our Groundless Doubts, and Jealousies
Of Popish Slavery.
For who can keep the Crowd in Peace,
But York and Albany?
[3]
The wandering Dove that was sent forth
To find some Landing near,
When Englands Ark was tossed on Floods
Of Jealousy and Fear;
Returns with Olive Branch of Joy,
To set the Nation free
From Whiggish Rage, that would destroy
Great York and Albany.
[4]
And now He is returned in Peace,
With all His Pompous Train,
Whom Heaven protected o'r the Seas,
'To Bless this Land again;
Let Us with Thankful Hearts comply,
And Joyful Harmony;
For Scotlands Hope, and Englands Joy,
Is York and Albany.
[5]
Let Bumpers flow, and Bonfires blaze,
And every Steeple Ring,
To set forth Royal Jemmy's Praise,
The Brother of our King,
Let Trumpets found, and Canons roar,
All with one voice agree,
Since Heaven again has brought ashore
Great York and Albany.
[6]
These solemn Rights they freely gave
To every Factiuns Brother;
Who thought the Nation to Enslave,
And Ruin one another:
To M(...) and each Factious Lord;
To O(...) and S(...)
But thought it Treason to afford
To York and Albany.
[7]
Now be confounded, all you Tribe
Of Ignoramus sway;
Who by Malicious Plots contrived
To drive her Heir away,
(As you did once before to France)
An Exile o'r the Sea;
Who to your grief did home advance
Great York and Alban.
[8]
And may he, with the Joys He wed,
Together flourish still;
And live to crush the Serpents Head,
Whose Sting did pierce his Heel;
Till Rebels tremble at his Name,
And all the Land agree,
The Just Succession to Proclaim
Of York and Albany.
