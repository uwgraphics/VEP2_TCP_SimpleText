A Full and True ACCOUNT OF THE TRIAL, CONDEMNATION, AND EXECUTION WITH THE
Last Dying WORDS OF AUGUSTINE KING.
Who was Executed near Hartford-Towns-end, on Wednesday March the 21st. 1687/8
THE often Examples of men faling by Justice, and their pretended Speeches
printed, before they suffer, are so common, that we have scarce the
encouragement to present the World with one which is real, and I doubt not but
to Most; will be grateful, The account being true, it needs no long preamble to
create a ^elief. The Person of whose end I am going to give an Account, was by
name ^ugustin King, born in the County of Cambridge of sober and honest
Parents, ^^s Father was a Dissenting Minister, who gave him liberal Education,
and ^^tred him in the University of Cambridge, to maturiate his Studies, but
faling (...) and selecting bad Company, and his Father being not able to allow
him where^^thal to maintain his extravagant humor, he betook himself to ill
Courses and was committed to Cambridge Gaol, from whence he made his escape,
and for sometime, by the pious arguments of his Parents, and the fear of coming
to a Public shame, he forsook his ill ways, and had an inclination to go to
Sea, for Which, some provisions were made about four years since, but
considering the hardship and hazard, which attended a Seafaring life, and
being not fully weaned from the visits and insinuations of his former lewd
companions, he spurned against good council, and the Convixions formerly made
upon him, and again betook himself to the most nefarious practices
imaginable, which brought him to this immature and untimely end.

About twelve Months since, he was by the Cambridge-carrier apprehended in
White Hall, for a Robbery committed on him, and was committed to the
Gate House, but in a little time found a means by his insinuating tongue to
make his escape from his Keeper: Since which time he has been concerned in an
innumerable Robberyes, for which he was lately proscribed in the public Gazet,
with this Emphasis, and above all Augustine King joined with a Menace to
Innkeepers that should abscond him. Notwithstanding, which he persevered in
his Robberies, having committed one in Essex but a few days before he was
taken, which was very accidental in his Inn, he was carried before a Magistrate
and committed to Newgate, where he was kept very close, and loaded with a pair
of Irons of an extraordinary weight, from whence he was removed to Hartford
where he took his Trial at the Assizes, several Indictments being brought
against him, upon one of which he was convicted, and received Sentence of Death,

He behaved himself with that modesty upon his Trial, that several engaged to
use their interest to procure him a Pardon, amongst whom were some Persons of
Honor, the High Shrieff, and most of the eminent Dissenters of the County, but
their solisitations with His Majesty, proved faithless, since little could be
said on his behalf saving, he was never concerned in a Murder, and the
resolution His Majesty has made, not to spare one of that wicked profession
that the Law has convicted.

Of all, which having notice, he began to apply himself to repent and consider
his latter end, and had several visits from a Parson who assured him of the
salvation of his Soul, if not his Body, in order to which, some applications
were made by his means, but proving ineffectual, the Priest acquainted him he
must prepare for Death: upon which he was desired by Mr. King, to desist in his
visits, for he knew the way to heaven better then he could show him, and craved
the asistance of some Dissenting Ministers, as also some worthy Divines of the
Church of England, and so with great zeal and assurance, h^ cheerfully waited
for the day of his Execution, which was o^ Wednesday last after the Sun was
down, an other who was exect^ted with him, was carried in a Cart, but he had
the favor to walk to the Gallows which stood a little out of the Town o^
Hartford, the high Shrieff walked by his side with whom he discoursed all the
way as they went, often smiling and freely telling them any thing they asked or
he knew, he particularly confessed a Robbery he lately committed on a Pedlar in
Essex for which an eminent Cytizen was accused upon the oaths of three but
cleared by his Jury, but denied being concerned any other way than sinisterly
in that Robbery for which he came to suffer he gave an account of the evil
practices of several Innkeepers etc. After which he kneeled down and made a
long and Pathetical Prayer, several Ministers joining with him, then he
ascended the Cart and was tied up, his Countenance all this time not in the
least changing, he begged forgiveness of all, whom he had offended or injured,
and of God for his sinning against Knowledge and was turned off speaking these
words.

Lord receive My Soul.

Amongst thousands of Spectators that accompanied him to the place of
Execution, not one went away without a Briny eye his Corpse the next day was
interred in the Churchyard at Hartford.

From the fate of this Man, all may take care to avoid the allurements of Satan
and ill men, since they naturally center in shame and destruction, for if the
strong, Learned, and cunning, could not avoid being catched and overtaken by
Justice, how shall others whom God and Nature has made inferior, therefore
the precepts of Christianity are safe: Fear GOD honor the KING, do good to all
men hurt to none, so shall it be well with thee; and thy days shall end in
Peace.

With Allowance.
