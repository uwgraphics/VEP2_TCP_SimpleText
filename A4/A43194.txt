The healing Balsom of a true Lover.
While Phillis seemed to be strange,
Her love was almost mad,
But when he found a sudden change,
It made his heart full glad
Tune of, Amoret and Phillis.


PHillis my wounded hearts delight
does triumph over my soul,
When she is gone out of my sight
I by my self condoul,
No comfort then at all I find
when absent she is from me,
I chide the w^ods cause they are unkind
and rail at every tree.
I wander through the shady woods
thinking my love to find,
I threaten then the sliding floods
and quarrel with each Wind.
The Lark that do so early rise
I asked if her she see,
But nothing she to me replies
but makes a song of me.
My passion she does strongly mock
laughs at what I endure,
And straight I leave my wandering flock
in hopes to find a cure.
Quite through the plains I rudely walk
like one bereft of wit,
And as unto my self I talk
I fall into a fit.
Strange sights methinks I then do see
which trouble me full sore,
If once I could again get free
I never would love her more,
But th^^e's no hopes for me at all
my li^^rty to gain,
Nor e'^e to get out of this thrall
poor love sick helpless Swain.
YOu happy shepherds that are free
pray keep so if you can,
And take a pattern now by me
a poor distressed man.
Love is a base and cruel cheat
and robbs men of their rest,
Composed of nothing but deceit
while free men they are blessed.
Phillis was false yet seemed kind
and caught me in a snare,
Now she bewrays her faithless mind
I mourn beneath despair.
O Cupid thou deceitful boy
let loose a helpless swain,
Deprived of his bliss and joy
and tossed in Seas of pain.
Cease, Cease my dear do not complain
bl^me not blind Cupids dart,
For I will ease thee of thy pain
and ease thy love sick heart.
What love did cause thee to endure
I grieve to think thereon,
Thou art the man i will thee assure
that I do dote upon.
To thee I seemed strange because
i would have thee fond of me,
And teach thee tricks in Cupids laws
I thought were strange to thee.
But now I find thou do acquaint
thy self with such like things,
I can^t endure to hear complaint
thou shall taste of loves springs.
The Balsom of my lips i will lay
upon my bleeding wound,
Shall cause thy pain to pass away
and shall soon be sound.
Come take a kiss from thy dear heart
my love I cannot express,
And when thou feel^st no more of smart
count it a happiness.
How many lovers have been lost
wanting a salve like mine,
And in the world been strangly crossed
yet by the power divine.
I Am sent to heal thy bleeding breast
and ease thee of thy sore.
For which I hope I shall be blessed
and happy evermore.
