BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE CONFEDERATE CATHOLICS OF IRELAND.
WHereas several Declarations and Protestations are said to have been
unlegally and unduely by secret, soul and sinister practices, and
under-hand-working, lately obtained from some particular persons within the
Quarters and Jurisdiction of the Confederate Catholics, touching the
conditions upon which the now peace is to be concluded, or war continued
within this Kingdom, by the said General Assembly which may tend to the
prejudice of our Religion, Government and Unity; And whereas such course of
proceeding is contrary to the fundamental Laws of this Realm, which We are
bound to observe, by the Oath of Association; And whereas such illegal
Protestations and Declarations, are destructive to all good government, and the
present Union of the said Catholics, and punished in all well governed States
and Commonwealths from whom We should take example, and is a prejudicating of
the Honourble, Pious and Religious intentions and proceedings of the said
Assembly, whose Decrees and Orders by the said Oath of Association, all and
every of the said Confederate Catholics, and their party, are obliged to
obey and perform; And whereas the said Declarations, and Protestation (if
gained) were obtained upon untrue and false surmises from persons ignorant of
the reasons (...) s olutions, which (if rightly understood) would satisfy any
pious Catholic, in point of Conscience, and any reasonable and well minded
man whatsoever, in point of loyaltic and safety, We therefore taking the
premises into our serious Consideration and observing the dangerous
consequence that might thereof ensue, as well to the breach of our Union as to
the total ruin and destruction of this Kingdom, do Order and Declare, that
all, and every the said protestations heretofore made (if any such were) were
obtained surrepticiously, and upon false grounds and pretenses, and do tend to
mutiny, sedition and breach of our Union, and therefore are to be suppressed as
Slanderous and Calumnious libells, and that the publishing hereafter of any the
said Protestations or Declarations already made, shall be High Treason, in the
offenders, and that the making contriving subscibing of hands, or laboring to
obtain hands to such Protestations of Declarations, or to any other such
Declarations, Protestations, Oaths of Covenants or Combination hereafter to be
made or published to the prejudicating or prejudice, of or contrary to the
sense of the Assembly in matters of Peace or War, shall be High Treason in
the Makers, Contrivers, Abetters, Favorers Procurers to subscribe, and
Subscribers, to such Declarations, Protestations, Oaths of Covenants, or
Combination; And all such Offenders, that hereafter shall offend in that kind,
are hereby declared incapable of any place of preferment or advancement in the
Commonwealth that lies in the gift or nomination of the public, and shall be
taken and reputed infamous, and common disturbers of the public Peace and
Tranquillitic of this Kingdom, and are accordingly to be proceeded against,
And We lastly Order that this Order shall be withal convenient speed Printed
and Published upon market days, between the hours of ten and two of the
Clock in the afternoon in the Market place of each Corporation, and Market
Town in this Kingdom. Given at Kilkenny the fourth day of July. Anno Domini,
1645.
