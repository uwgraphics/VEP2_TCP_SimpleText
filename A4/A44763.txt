To the knowing Reader.
MAn is the Worlds Abridgement, who enrouls
Within himself a Trinity of souls;
He runs through all Creations by degrees,
First, he is only Matter on the lees,
Whence he proceeds to be a Vegetal,
Next Sensitive, and so Organical:
Then by Divine infusion a third soul,
The Rational does the two first control:
But when this soul comes in, and where she dwells
Distinct from others no Dissector tells.
And, which no creture else can say, that state
Enables her to be Regenerate;
She then becomes a Spirit, and at last
A Devil or a Saint, when she has cast
That clog of flesh, which yet she takes again
To perfect her beatitude, or pain;
Thus Man is first or last allied to all
Cretures in Heven, Earth, or Hells blackhall
This Vision may conduce to let us know
Our present baseness, and our future bliss,
If it make any gentle souls to glow,
And mend their pace that way, I have my wish
JAM. HOVVELL.

TO The Right Honorable the Lady ELISABETH DIGBYE, etc.
Madame,
COuld the Rational soul, whom Philosophy calls the Queen of forms, and
Divinity, the Image of the Allmighty, be seen by the outward eye of sense, she
would (as Plato sometimes spoke of Virtue were she so visible) raise in us a
world of admiration; We should be so ravished with her beauty, and so struck in
love, that we would leave all things else to win her favor.

An odd Humorist vapouring once that Women had no souls, was answered by a
modest Lady, (...) Sir, you are deceived, for I can p^^duce a good Text to the
contrary. My soul does magnify the Lord, and it was a woman that spoke it: No
less humorous was He, who would maintain that the salique Law was in force in
Heaven, as well as in France, which excluded women from reigning. But much more
civil was a farewell that the Count of Lemos took of the Duchess of Pastrana,
who having invited him to see a new Palace that she had built, with a stately
Chapel annexed, at his departure said, Madam, I see your body is fairly
Housd, but I find that your soul is far better Housd than your Body. Madam, I
have the happiness to know your L shp many years (near upon 4. life's in the
law) and truly I never knew any whose soul was better lodgd, and furnishd with
more virtues and graces, which makes me resolved to live and die.

Your Lshps most humble and dutiful servant JAM. HOVVELL.

The PROEM.
IT was about the Summer solstice, when the Measurer of Time, that glorious
Luminarie of Heven, allowed but little above three hours night to cover this
part of the Hemisphere, That after my sleep, a second stole gently upon me,
which happend about the dawnings of the day, when those grosser sort of
soporiferous fumes, that are wont to ascend from the stomach to lock up the
outward senses for their natural repose, being dissipated and spent, the purest
kind of subtle rarefied vapors rise up to the Region of the brain, which use
to represent more plain and even objects to the Imagination, and make the
story and circumstances of dreams more coherent and clear, though the ^ost
lucid fancies that appear u^^^ ^s in sleep, be but as stars in a cloudie night,
or the branches of trees in a thick standing pool; I say it was about the break
of day, that I had an unusual Dream, or Vision rather; For, me thought, a
little airie, or rather an ethereal kind of spark did hover up and down about
my body; It seemed to have a shape yet it had none but a kind of reflection, it
was, me thought, within me, and it was not, but at such a distance, and in that
posture, as if it lay Sentinel. At last, I found it was my Soul which uses to
make sollices in time of sleep, and fetch vagaries abroad, to practice how she
can live apart after the dissolution, when she is separated from the body and
becomes a spirit. Afterward the fantasma varying, she took a shape, and the
nearest resemblance I could make of it, was to a veild Nunn with a flaming
cross on the left side of her breast, who in doleful tones and thr^^^^g
accents, broke out into these que^^^ous ejaculations.

A DIALOG between the SOUL and the BODY.
Soul. OMe! how much reason have I to rue the time that ever I was cloistered
up among those walls of clay; What cause have I to repent that ever I was
thrown into that dungeon, that corrupt mass of flesh? For when I first entered,
I bore the image of my Creator in some luster, but since that time, it is
scarce discernable on me, in regard of those soul leprous spots and taintures
which I have contracted from those frail corporeal organs, which have so
pitifully disfigured and transformed me, that I cannot be called the same Thing
I was at first, the Character of my Creator being almost quite lost in me.


Body. Dear Soul, how comes it to pass that you are in so much anxietie? how
comes it that you are so discomposed, and transported with passion, imputing
the cause of your indispositions to me? Alas! you know well that I am but an
unwieldie lump of earth, a mere passive thing of my self. It is you that
actuats and animats me, otherwise I could neither think, speak, or do any
thing, nay without your impulss I could have no motion at all; you are the
Pilot that steers ^his frail Bark; you fit in the box of the Chariot, I am but
the organ, you are the breath; you are the intelligence that governs and
enlightens this dark orb of mine, so that all my motions are derived from the
poles of your commands, it is you that denominates me a man; therefore, if any
thing be amiss, it is I that have more reason to complain, in regard that being
but a mere unwieldie trunk of my self, I am quickened altogether by you,
whether you be (...) a continual motion as some Philosophers would have you to
be, or (...) the perfection from whence all motion proceeds as others term you;
therefore because I am liable also to future punishment as well as you, it is I
that have more cause of complaint, and to repent me of that syneresis and union
which is betwixt us: For it had been less danger for me to have been an
inanimate thing, and to have had neither vegetal, sensitive, or rational Soul,
either by traduction or infusion cast into me, for then I had been free from
those numberless incommodities which all three are liable unto; The First being
subject to excess of moisture and drought, to blastings and the fury of the
Meteors; The Second to hunger and thirst with multitudes of diseases; The
Third, to wit the Rational, not only to all these, but to vexation of spirit,
to corroding cares, to griping thoughts, to a perpetual clashing and combating
of the humors, insomuch that Man of all creatures is Heautontimorumenos, a
self-tormenter, a persecutor and crucifier of himself, all which are emanations
from the Intellectual soul; which besides uses to puzzle the brain with
sturdie doubts, and odd furrnises, touching the mysteries of saving Faith,
whereas indeed, as sense should vail to reason, so reason should strike sail to
faith; moreover she is forward oftentimes to question the very works of
Creation, and quarrel with Nature the handmaid of the Almighty in the method
of her Productions, as (to make one instance for all) the Philosopher was angry
with Her, because She did not make the stones of the river for bread, as she
did the water thereof for drink.


Soul. It Is true (to answer the first part of your answer) that it is my office
to inform and actuat you, which operations are emanations from me; I am, I
confess being undivisible, inextensive, without parts and inorganical, Tota in
toto, and tota in qualibet part, I am diffused up and down throughout that
fabric of flesh, I am all in the whole, and all in every part; you have no
movement at all without me, but you, yielding more obedience, and being more
pliable to the sensual appetit, and the Will, than to the dictates and
directions of the Intellect my principal faculty, have brought me to this
pass; whereas those eyes of yours should be as crystal casements, through which
I might behold the glorious firmament, and study my Creator in the Volumes of
Nature, you have made them to intromit, and let out beams of vanity and
lightness; They are foiled so thick with earth, that I can scarce discern
Heaven through them; Those ears of yours, whereas they should let in holy
Exhortations, and wholesome Precepts, you have used them as trunks to receive any
idle discourses, and vain sounds, they have delighted more to hear Carrolls and
Catches than Hymns and Anthems. That mouth, tongue and voice of yours, whereas
they were given you for Organs to sound out the glory of your Creator, and sing
Halelujahs unto Him, you have made them Instruments of equivocation, and
profaness; Those hands of yours, whereas they were designed to be stretched
forth to do deeds of Charity, and to pen Divine Meditations, you have employed
them to work your own revenges, and to scribble idle frivilous fancies; That
throat of yours, whereas it was created for a conduit-pipe to let out Pious
Ejaculations, you have made it the gullet of luxury and excess; Those feet of
yours, whereas they were made you to walk in the paths of Piety and Virtue,
and lead you to Gods holy House, you have used them to run into the road of all
licentiousness; When I examine your heart, the seat of your affections, whereas
you should have made it a Closet for your Creator to reside in, and kept it
sweet and cleanly for that purpose, I find you have made it a cage of unclean
birds, of hatred, hypocrisy, choler and spiritual pride, the fuliginous
evaporation whereof has fumed up into your brain, and infected all the cells
thereof, your Fantasy has been extravagant and wild, your Memory has been
like a fierce that has kept the chaff, and let out the pure grain, you have
been more mindful of bad than good turns; your understanding has been full of
scepticisms, your will has clashed with Reason, your Reason with Faith, your
Faith with Heaven; In fine, when I take you all in a lump, I find you naught
else but a bladder puffed up with ayrie passions, and malignant humors,
amongst whom I am perpetually crucified as betwixt so many Iudases; insomuch
that I may justly say, that you stand as a rotten wall twixt me and the beams
of my Creator, which would glance upon me with a stronger reverberation, were
it not for that foul bulk of matter, that Cargazon of all sorts of infirmities
which are stowed up in that sluggie and frail vessel.


Body. A frail vessel indeed, yet, under favor, you sit at the helm of it;
but I confess you cannot give me terms low and vile enough in comparison of
your self, who are of an infinitely more noble extraction, the rational soul
being Queen of forms, and the body, when she departs from it, the gastliest,
and most noisome of things, yet though you be a ray of Divinity, and I but a
rag of mortality, though you bear God Almighties image, and I but Adams,
though you be in me as a Diamond set in Horn, though you be by a mysterious
heavenly infusion, and I by a seminary traduction, yet we have the same
Creator, (as Ants and Angels have) his hands have made me, and fashioned me in
the womb, and the holy Text tells me, that I am wonderfully made; Nature his
subordinate minister took much pains about me, she used great deliberation in
the business, for the passed four several successive acts before I was
completed.

First there was a conjunction and cooperation of the sexes, which among some
require diverse years before the work take effect, as the present King of France
was two and twenty years a getting; and the last Prince of Conde thirteen
months in the womb.

Secondly, Then followed Conception which required a well tempered vessel to
conserve the generative sperm by occlusion and constringement of the orifice of
the Matrix, which sperm being first blood, and afterward cream, was by a
gentle ebullition coagulated into a cruddie lump, which the womb by its natural
heat made fit to receive form, and to be organized, whereupon Nature fell a
working, to delineate all the members and other parts, beginning with those
that are most noble, as the heart, the brain, and the liver, whereof the
Galenists would have the liver to be first framed, in regard it is the source
and shop of blood; but the Peripatetiques held the heart to have the
precedencie, because it is the first thing that lives and the last that dies.

Thirdly, Nature continued in this operation until a perfect shape was
introduced, which was the third Act, and is called Formation, being naught else
but a production of an organical shapen body out of the spermatical substance
caused by the plastic virtue, and vigor of the vital spirits, nor can I tell
whether this Act was finished in thirty, fifty, forty two, or forty five
days after the Conception, for the Naturalists allow such variety of times
according to the disposition of the matter before the Embrion be formed;
moreover, they observe, that Nature proceeds with those deliberate pawses, that
forty days after the Conception, the creature is no bigger than a grain of
wheat.

Fourthly, This being done, I was wrapped in three tunicles or membranes, then
I was animated with three souls, the first with that of Plants, called the
vegetative soul, then with a sensitive, wherein I communicate with brute
animals, and lastly, with the rational soul, was immitted; The two first were
generated ex Radice, as the Philosophers term it, viz. from the seeds of the
Parents, but the last, which is your self, was by immediate infusion from God
himself, though neither Naturallists nor Divines have yet positively determined
when this Infusion is made; Nor could ever any Anatomists, by their curious
dissections, and inspections, find yet any organ in the body, or crannie and
receptacle in the brain, or any distinct place differing from other Animals
where this rational soul should reside in the Humane body: Thus has man an
intellectual soul he knows not where, and infused he knows not how, nor when,
so ignorant he is of the manner of his Creation; This last Act is called
Animation, and as the Physicians allow Animation double the time that Formation
had, which sometimes happens in eight months, sometimes in ten, but most
commonly in nine: By these degrees and pauses was I made, and casting off my
secundine, I came into the world to be a domicile not a dungeon for you, to be
a kind of ark to carry you to the port of Bliss, to be a tabernacle for you,
nay, to be a Temple for the Holy Ghost to dwell in: Nor did Nature altogether
play the Bungler in doing her work, for she was pia Matter, a Pious Mother in
framing the cells of my brain, and though she set me forth in no great volume,
yet by this slenderness and gracilitie of constitution, I have the advantage to
carry less corruption about me, for the more flesh, the more corruption; Now,
touching those fraylties you speak of, whereunto I am subject, you know they
accompanied me to the world, and that I derive them from the protoplast, from
the loins of my Gransire Adam, the rust and canker of whose skin and sin, stick
unto me, being molded of the same matter.


Soul. It Is true, that you are molded of Earth as Adam was, but the earth it
self which gave him his composition and denomination, did blush when she went
to make him, foreseeing, as it were his infirmities and propensity to all ill.

But I find by this reply of yours, that you are well acquainted with your
self, by the account you give me of the method that Nature used in your
Generation; Now, self-acquaintance is, after the knowledge of the Creator, the
wisest; it is one of the paths, though a slabbie one, that leads us to the high
road toward heaven, (which is a rougher way than that you found ore the Alps
and Pyrenean mountains; The speculations whereof would make you truly value
and vilify your self, it should prick those tumors, and timpanies of pride
that use to rise up in the humane creature, when he contemplates how near that
vessel wherein he slept so long in the bosom of his causes, is to the
excrementitious parts.

Now, out of your discourse may be inferred, that Man is that great Amphibion
of Nature, he passes through the degrees of all creations; He was first but
mere Matter, then he grew up to be a Vegetall, afterward a sensitive, then a
Human Creature, in which condition he is capable of a regeneration, and he is
to be at last a Spirit, good or bad;

Now, you have two things that distinguish and specificat you from the first
three; the one is outward, which is that erect upright Posture and shape you
bear to behold Heaven your last and indeed your only true Country, this being
but a transitory passage to that, whereas your other fellow Cretures have their
faces looking upon the earth; The 2 is inward, viz. the faculty of Reason, which
makes you a compensation for some inconveniences and weaknesses, whereby you
are inferior to other elementary Creatures; By Reason man tames the Libian
Lion, he puts Castles upon the Elephants back, makes the huge Camel to kneel
and take up his burden, by Reason he fetches the Eagle out of the Air, and with
his Harping-iron draggs up the great Leviathan out of the deeps; by Reason he
rules and curbs Nature her self, making her pliable to his ends; Now all the
operations of Reason, which are the best of human acts, you derive from me; But
whereas you say that there can be no particular place found out either within
you, or without you, more than there is in the Sensitive Creature where I
should reside, you must know, that as the Solar Light displayeth it self
throughout the whole Hemisphere, yet it cannot be said to possess any place
more than another; so I, being a beam of immortality, am diffused through that
little World of yours to quicken and heat all parts, yet I confine my self to
no peculiar cell, and this inorganitie shows, that I can live separat from
you (though you by no means without me) as appears already by some functions
that I exercise, and those abstracted speculations that I use without the help
or concurrence of matter, and quantity, which are my instruments only in
ordine ad sensibilia, not Intelligibilia: yet I let you know that I have some
closets in that Fabric of yours, more choice than others, I am radically in
the heart, where the vital spirits have their residence, where the arterial and
most illustrious blood does run in the left ventricle; But I am principally in
the brain, where the animal Spirits inhabit, and whereon I cast my intellectual
influences for Discourse and Reason, which influences, the brain of a brute
animal is not capable of, or adapted by Nature to receive; Moreover, the veins
are branched up and down the body, the blood is in the veins, the spirits in
the blood, and I am much in the spirits.

By this intimacie of communication I am polluted daily more and more, I am
infected hereby and leprified with sin, and I fear me, that as the wounds of my
Savior appeared upon his body after his Resurrection, so those gashes and
black spots which I have received from you, will appear upon me after my
separation; And whereas you allege, that you are liable to future punishment
as well as I for the aberrations and transgressions of this life, I must tell
you, that when after my devorcement from you, I become a spirit, a simple
substance and a sphere of my self, the sharpness and activity, the simpleness
and subtility of my pain being purely spiritual will be far more grievous and
cruciatory than, any those gross members of yours can be capable of, I shall
endure all torments at once with certain knowledge of a succeeding perpetuity,
without any hopes of the least discontinuance or relaxation.

Furthermore, whereas you say that I sit in the box to guide and govern that
chariot of yours, it is true I do so, but as the divine Philosopher said, that
chariot of the body is led by two horses, the one black, the other white, this
last which are your good inclinations I can easily rule, but the black one,
which are your turbulent wild passions and and obliquities I cannot govern, so
that I am afraid he is oftentimes so headstrong and furious that he will at
last tumble us both down the precipice of destruction; Lastly whereas you
allege that I sit at the stern of that leaking bark of yours, it is true I do
so, but I sail in her as one passing upon some part of the Danubius, where she
meets with the River Sava, and the two Rivers running in collateral
consortship many miles without intermingling, the Boats that row along the
stream, have oftentimes, on the one side, a black muddie water, and on the
Danubs side, a clear stream. In this manner do I sail in that body of yours,
through good and bad affections, through clear and turbid humors (though the
last be more predominant) whence such vapors arise, that cause strange
tempests in me, and disturb the calm of my mind, which makes me weary of this
habitation, when I think on those pollutions, and black specks wherewith I am
contaminated, whereunto my meditations tended lately in these few Stanzas of
multifarious cadences.

Lord I cry,
Lord I fly
To thy Throne of grace,
This world is irksom unto me;
In my mind
Stings I find
Of that dismal place
Where pains still growing young never die;
O thou whose clemency
Reaches to earth from sky
Set my sins from me as wide
As is East
From the West,
Or the Court of bliss
From the Infern abyss,
So far let us asunder ever bide;
Angels blessed,
With the rest
Of that Heavenly quire,
Which Halelujas always sing,
Fain would I
Mount on high,
And those seats aspire
Where every season is a constant spring;
O thou who thought no scorn
To be in Bethlem born
Though grand Monarch of the sky,
Through a flood
Of thy blood
Let me safely dive
And at that port arrive,
Where I may ever rest from shipwreck free.
Faith and Hope
Take your scope,
And my Pilots be,
To waft me to this blisfull bay,
Gently guide
Through the tide
Of Man's misery
My Bark, that it lose not the way,
When landed I shall be
At that Port, pardon me
If I bid you both farewell,
Only love
Reigns above
Among celestial souls
Where passion not controuls,
Nor any thing but Charity does dwell.
Lord of light
In thy sight
Are those Mounts of bliss,
Which humane brains transcend so far,
Ear nor ey
Can descry,
Nor heart fully wish,
Or toungs of men and saints declare,
Those sense-surmounting joys
That free from all annoys
For those few up-treasur'd lie,
Which ere sun
Shone at noon
Have their names enrolled
In characters of gold
Through the white volums of Eternity.

Body. You are beholden to my frailties for this and such like Meditations,
who raise them in you, as rusty steel uses to strike sparks of fire; sin it
self becomes an advantage to us sometimes; nay, mankind may be said to be
beholden to the Jews and Judas, because they were the outward Instruments that
wrought salvation; for the Cross, which they set upon mount ^alvarie for the
crucifying of our Savior, was the first Christian Altar that ever was erected,
and it may be well doubted, whether he that hates the Altar, shall ever have
benefit of the Sacrifice, as one said. But I am sorry to hear from you, that
your dwelling in me is so tedious unto you, all that I can say, is, I could
wish you were better housed; Now touching those Passions and Affections you
speak of, (which are also my Inmates) they are to the soul, as sayls to a ship,
they are also as so many gales to fill those sayls, as so many breezes to blow
this small Vessel of mine, wherein you are embarked to the haven of happiness,
and as I said before, they are mere Emanations from you; for there is nothing
of motion in me, but what I derive from you; Now touching Affections and
Passions, how uncoth would all human actions be, unless they were sweetened by
them: how stupid and slumbering would our Spirits be without them? What a dull
thing were Generation, if there were no Concupiscence? What comfort would there
be in educating children, if there were not a natural love that affected us?
Charity would grow key-cold, if Pity did not heat her to action; and that
Soldier fights best, who being in the field, is possessed with the Passion of
anger, which the Philosopher calls the Whetstone of fortitude; He cannot become
a true Penitent, that is not affecte^ with sorrow nor a true Convert, who is
not affected with hatred of sin.

Touching other infirmities you charge me withal, you know I have them by
natural and hereditary propagation from my first Parents, whose corruption was
entailed upon all mankind, which may also excuse, at least extenuat my faults.
But besides these Resons, I have another that may serve for an Apology in my
behalf, which is, that all these members of mine, and that mass of blood which
runs through them, with the cestern of Humors, as likewise all the cells of my
brain, are guided and governed by the motions of celestial bodies, whose
influxes do perpetually invade me, and are irresistible: Add hereunto, that
there is a malus Genius an ill Spirit that is always busy about me, and ready
to take all advantages to impel me to acts of weakness. All these things being
well considered, and weighed in a just balance, conclude me to be of my self
but a poor passive thing, and to act by the impulses of others.

Touching those Affections and Passions you speak of, which are naught else but
a conglobation of the Spirits, I not only allow, but am glad of them, they
serve as wings to carry me up to heaven (and you after me) or as you say, they
are as so many gales to send me thither, provided that the one do only blow,
not bluster and raise tempests; And that the other be not irregular or
exorbitant, but directed to their true Object: The Passions are as so many
pleaders wrangling at a bar, and Reason, my chiefest faculty, should be their
Chancellor; But oftentimes those troops of furious Spirits, which Passion
musters up, and sends up boiling to the brain, are so violent, that those
Spirits which are under the jurisdiction of Reason, are not able to encounter
them, though she unite all her forces to that purpose.

Moreover, whereas you would pin your infirmities upon your first Parents, it is
true, that although Adam at first was created in a state of integrity and
perfection, being he was the Epitome of the Creation, and a kind of Microcosm,
a little World of himself, whereunto there may be some allusion in his name,
which comprehends the four corners of the World, the word Adam being made up of
(...), viz. East, West, North and South; Although at first he was completed to
that state, and yet made capable of a higher perfection, which capacity was no
imperfection, but a seal to a higher; I say, that although he was so
accomplished to present happiness, yet by the seducement of the ill Spirit, he
fatally fell from it; nor was the fault as much in the Woman, being the weaker
vessel, but in him who was the stronger; Now the trial of man's universal
Obedience, being intended in him, and he failing, the guilt thereof falls upon
his Posterity, that were all then potentially in his loins, who ever since
have brought with them into the world the stains of that original Corruption,
which yet Christians have a way to wash off in the Font of Baptism, the lavoir
of Regeneration: yet there is an Eve lurking still within the humane body, viz.
the Will, which is so full of obliquities and fraylties, that while I lie at
close ward against one infirmity, another is ready to wound me; which makes me
so great a sinner, that the Indulgences of a whole Jubilee (had they such a
virtue as some believe they have) were not able to absolve me.

Moreover, whereas you averr the Stars to bear sway, and to have an
incontroulable predominance over all sublunary Cretures, and consequently over
that body of yours; It is a truth that cannot be denied, as we find by daily
experience, that all Elementary Cretures depend upon the motion and virtue of
the heavenly: but though these influxes from above do by their operation toss
and tumble the humors as they lift, and work upon corporeal things in man; yet
notwithstanding, it cannot be said that these operations do extend to those
inclinations and actions, that depend immediately upon the Empire of the Will,
with the other faculties and Powers of the Mind, which are immanent, and merely
spiritual; yet I confess, if we observe the order and method that the
Understanding and the Will do use in the production of their functions, it will
be found, that the influence of the Celestial Luminaries, and the impressions
that they make, must have something to do herein; but it is indirectly and
accidently, in regard that all terrestrial bodies by a gradual kind of
subordination being governed, as was said before, by the superior, it must be
inferred of necessity, that whatsoever is natural in the humane Creture, as
the organs of that body of yours, must feel the Power of their influences; In
regard that the spiritual faculties are so united, and have such an intercourse
with the corporeal organs, that they cannot operate, unless the said organs
ministerially concur, and contribute thereunto, by presenting the objects,
which are the sensible species; but I except the abstracted ideas and
speculations of the Mind; whence it inevitably comes to pass, that in regard of
this strict league, and natural correspondence, which is between them, the
inward faculties partake somewhat of, and submits to the dominion that the
Planets and Constellations have over the sensual appetite, which together with
the will, are disposed often, and incited, I will not say constrained, by their
influxes.

Out of these premises this conclusion does follow, that the Stars do operate,
and make impressions upon the humane creture (as well as other productions of
the Elements) both outwardly and inwardly, but they serve themselves of those
material parts and organs of yours, that are as portholes to let in the
influxes which they dart from above to work upon the faculties, to incline and
incite them to good or ill, according to their dispositions, though not by way
of enforcement, for they have not such a tyrannical and absolute supremacy,
but there is a freedom still left to a well-ordered Will; And as there are
outward Bongraces, to preserve the face from being tanned by the violence of
Solar heat, so there are intern Graces to keep the inward parts from all ill
and malignant influences that are lanced from above; according to the Poet, --
Sapiens dominabitur Astris.

The Wise man sways ore the Stars; Therefore it was a very pertinent answer
that one gave to a Genethliacal Astrologer, who having taken much pains to pry
into the horoscope for the calculating of his Nativitie, and telling the
party, that in regard such and such stars were in conjunction at the hour of
his Birth, therefore he must be subject to such and such ill humors and
dispositions. It Is true, said he, that I was born such a one, but I was born
again, meaning his spiritual regeneration: For as we find that a virtuous
education does oftentimes correct the infirmities, and rectify the obliquities
of nature, so there be interior motions of Grace, which come from a higher
power than the Stars, that curb and check the operations which proceed from the
supern influxes: Yet are the intellectual powers easily inclined to be
transported, and snatched away by the sensual appetit, and the natural
allurements thereof, for the humane soul is not sui juris, she is not so
independent and absolut of her self, but that she may be said to depend upon
the Totum compositum, upon the body in general, by the mediation of whose
instruments she imploys her faculties, end exercises her actions in order to
sensible things.

But as the stars in this firmament are whirled away by the overruling motion
of the Primum mobile, the first mover from East to West, yet they have a
particular and contrary motion of their own from West to East, wherein they,
proceed notwithstanding, in a constant interrupted pace; so I may be said to be
oftentimes whirld away by the irregular and violent motions of that Compositum,
that fleshly sphere of yours, yet I go on still in my own motion toward my
last goal, and my sovereign good.

Now whereas the Heavens work on inferior bodies, by three instruments, viz. by
Light, Motion, and Influence, the first ingendering heat in the Air by
attrition and rarefaction, which is done by a simple or compounded ray, to wit,
reflection; The second, by measuring our times and seasons, both which may be
said to be external visible instruments; The third, which is influence, is a
hidden intern quality, it produces metals, causes fluxes and refluxes,
ripens the Embrion in the womb, with such like effects, and as it was
discoursed before, it operates in the human creture upon his very
intellectuals, through the exterior material parts; yet not by way of
compulsion, but inclination, as was said before, therefore the influxes of
Heaven are no excuse for you, as you alledg, because they are resistable.

Lastly, touching the Malus genius an ill spirit, which you say does haunt you,
and is ever at your elbow, to push you forward to ill actions, and suggest into
you bad conceptions, I must tell you there is also a Bonus genius or demon, a
good spirit that always attends you, whose infusions, precepts, and cautions if
you would obey, you would not only see the best, and approve of it, but follow
and put it in practice.


Body. This discourse does administer me but small comfort, yet I thank you
that you make me know my self better by displaying unto me my own condition,
and that magazin of infirmities which are stored up in this little tabernacle
of yours, yet I shall never make those infirmities, nor all the effects
thereof, were they more in number, greater than my Creators mercy, either out
of any despondencie of Spirit, and despair, in rejecting it as some do, or by
presumption, in slighting it as others do: For if the first Man, who was
immediately molded and made by God himself in such a state of perfection, had
his frailties; If Samson the strongest man had also his; If Solomon the wisest
man had his; If David, the holiest of men, who had so many advantages, as to be
a Prophet, and so anointed with oil above others; if that Prophet who came of
the chosen seed, and consequently, was not cast in so corrupt a mold as others,
I say, if the Prophet David who was a Man after Gods own heart, a character,
the like whereof was never given to any but unto him, I say if such a man, and
such men had infirmities in so high a measure, how is it possible but that I
should have them in a greater number? therefore my transgressions are but deeds
of my defects, and effects of those general frailties that have attended, and
are entailed upon the best of men.

Now, touching my corporeal Organs and Senses which you tax so much, it is true
that my eyes have oftentimes gazed upon earthly vanities, and grass-green
objects, yet at other times they have looked upon sky-colour. I have cast them
up toward Heaven, and fixing them a good while (with some ejaculations) upon a
part of the deepest azure I could spy, they cured me once of a shrewd defluxion
(by which experiment, I also found that such a fixation does much corroberat
the nerves and conserve the sight) that distilled into them. I have by Them often
admired the fair fabric of the Universs, surveing all the parts thereof round
about as far as my optics could reach, and stood astonished at their
Excellencies, as beams streaming from a heavenly Creator (and refracting on the
visible world) on whom their preservation depends, and in whom they were
concentred intentionally before they had any existence; I observe how Nature is
here and there checked by Him, when I see how he sets bounds to the vast
tumbling Ocean, and that those mountains of snow, which hang in the Ayrie
Region, and those floud-gates of waters do not fall down and precipitate at
once to over-whelm the earth, which is so little a thing in comparison of the
vast expansion of the Air; As also in the operation of diverse other productions
of Hers. For if Nature did go on still in her own course and constant method of
effects and causes, this might induce a belief, that she were Governness of all
things; but when we see, that sometimes she has not her full swing, intending
things that she is not able to perfect, but falls short of her purposes, as
also that her ordinary operations are restrained, and grow lame, We must
conclude, that there is a predominant Power that ore-sways her, and moves the
sphere of her activitie as he lift. Thus by the optics of the Ey, (the
eminentest of my senses) I make the (...), the Universe my Universitie to
study my Maker, breaking out often (when I go into the fields, and find all
things subservient to Man) into that ejaculation of the Psalmist, Oh that men
would praise the Lord for his goodness, and declare the wonders he does for the
children of men. Nor do I by the benefit of the Ey read Divinity among
sublunarie creatures where every spire of grass may serve for a letter, but I
spel my Creator among the stars, and indeed there is not any mundane object
does delight and ravish me so much, as to contemplate those glorious lamps of
Heven in a clear night, wherewith I find my self so much affected, that with
Emilius I could find in my heart to congratulate the Moons deliverie from an
Eclips; therefore it may stand well with Christianity, to hold those the best
of Pagans, that ask blessing of the Sun.

Touching my Organs of hearing, it is true as you say, they serve too often to
let in every frivolous tale, or sonet, yet as the Philosopher calls the Hearing
sensum disciplinae, the sense of learning, whereby the soul, as he thought,
being at first infusion a kind of rasa tabula, recovers all her notions by way
of Reminiscence, I have made it often (let all this be spoken without vanity)
the sense of saving knowledge for Faith comes by hearing; I have set open the
anfractuous passages thereof to take in the sacred Oracles of God, and the
mysteries of salvation, and when I hear a holy anthem it brings all my spirits
to my ears in throngs; A grave elaborat sermon works the like effect, such a
sermon as he speak of, who coming out of a Church, and being asked whether the
sermon was done, yes, said he, it is done in the church, but it begins now in
me: but while my Faith is fed, I do not love to have my Reason famished, I do
not love to be worded to death by such tautological and rambling insipid
confused stuff that some Enthusiasists use to evaporat, wherein it is as
difficult to find any coherence in point of matter or methodical contexture, as
it is to make a rope of that sand whereby they prate.

My feet it is true, go too often astray to the bypath of vanity, but they
come back again to the right track, as one going on a journey, and hearing by
the way a pack of hounds, he goes and follows the sport a while, and then
returns to his road; I have the grace to direct them often to Gods holy house,
where with legs and knees I employ them in the humblest manner of
genu-flection, to offer him sacrifices of prayer and praises;

I reach out my hands sometimes to lend unto the Lord, by relieving the poor
(according to my pittance) knowing that Charity does cover a multitude of sins:
my fingers also I find pliable now and then to write divine meditations,
whereunto I employ them altogether upon the holy Saboth.

My mouth, my tongue, and heart, also join (be it still spoke without vainness)
at least to ejaculat my guilt and his glory; and I find the arterial blood,
which is in the least ventricle thereof boiling, me thinks, within me in
affection toward him, the exhalations whereof rise up, and fill all the cells
of my brain to contemplat his goodness, as will appear unto you in these few
ternaries of Stanzas.

Could I screw up my brain so high
With soaring raptures that mightfly
Unto the Empyrean sky,
How would I laud the Lord of light,
Who fills all things, and every wight
With plenty, vigor, and delight.
My voice with Halelujahs loud
Should pierce and dissipat the clouds
Which in the Airie region crowd;
Then through the Element of fire
Unto the Stars they should aspire,
And so to the seraphic quire.
Thus earth and sky, with every thing
Should join with me, and carrols sing
Unto the everlasting King.
Touching my interior Passions, I confess, they have too great a dominion in
me, choler, which has more heat than light in it, does too often transport me,
some fires glow in me, as if they were flown from hell, and such a fire no
meaner man than Saint Paul, though a Convert, and one that had been a Traveller
in the other world, felt within him, impatience and rashness, intemperance,
self-conceit, and hatred have reigned in me, I have other odd things (and
indeed all things which attend human weakness) that I am subject unto, as too
much credulity and lightness; sadness contracts, and mirth too suddenly
dilates my spirits, and makes them break out into violent fits of laughter,
which though it be a harmless Passion, yet there is none that distorts a man so
much, for it extends the forehead, declines the brow, half shuts the eye,
raising a kind of splendour about them, it crumples up the nose, drives back the
cheeks, and makes pits in them, it shows the teeth, makes the tongue pendant in
the mouth, it hinders the swallowing by contracting and shutting the muscles
which serve that action, it gives such girds to the Diaphragma that it
obstructs the respiration for the time, it contracts all the members, and beats
upon the flancks, it puts forth arms, legs and hands in strange posturs; It
causes Syncopes sometimes, and raises an irregular motion in the pulse; thus
this Passion disguiseth me too often, and betrays my folly, though one,
apologizing for this Passion, says, that laughter does not as much discover a
man to be a fool, but that there is a fool in his company, which causes him
to laugh. There is so much prodigality in me, that I think I shall never be
covetous, I shall never be condemned for a rich man, nor be so simple, as to
roast meat for others, while I starve my self; I have other Passions that dwell
in me, whereof there can be no excess, as Hope and Love; by the first I think I
shall be long lived, for of all the Passions there is none so advantageous for
health, in regard the spirits therein, which coroborat and quicken all the
parts, are moderate, she stops, and keeps them back that they cannot dissipat
nor make any vehement agitation or eagerness; for if the spirits be too active
and violent in their operations, they may produce strong actions, but it
shortens our days, because those spirits easily scatter, and so consume the
natural moisture, which Hope uses not to do.

Touching the other Passion, viz. Love, Nature herein has been benign, and
bountiful unto me, for she has given me good store, so that I think I am not
in the arrear to any for that, I take much more pleasure in the retaliation of
a good turn, than in the revenge of a wrong, etc.

This Love extends to all my fellow Cretures, for it makes an impression of a
kind of tenderness in me, when I see any of them go to the slaughter; Insomuch,
that I could live a Pythagorean, all the days of my life, upon roots, fruits,
pulse and whit-meats, which Nature reaches unto us so gently without any
violence; what a coil there is with so many hounds, horses and men to take away
the life of a Hare or Partridge: what blowing and puffing, what sweating and
swearing is used in killing a poor Dear? which makes me think upon the madman,
whom the Italian Doctor had put naked in a Pond up to the navil, and it
happening, that a Falconer passed by, luring after his Hawk, he asked the madman
whether he had seen her, the madman staring upon him, and asking him diverse
questions touching his Hawks, Hounds, and horse, and finding that all that
expense and pains was but to kill some poor Bird; he told the Falconer, Get you
gone hence as soon as you can, for if ^he Doctor comes out, and finds you,
whereas he has put me here but to the navil, he will clap you up to the very
neck for a greater madman.

But touching Rational Cretures which are of my own species, and bear the
Character of Christians, I can hate no man only for his opinion, difference of
Fancy and face to me is all one; it mov's Pity rather in me than hatred; The
Greek, all the while he has the same Creed with me, though among other
tenants, he denies, that the souls of holy men do enjoy the blissfull vision of
God, or the souls of wicked men are tormented in Hell before the day of
judgment; The Melchites or Assyrians, the greatest sect of Christians in the
Orient, though among other wrong opinions, they hold, That the Holy Ghost
proceeds from the Father, etc. The Russian, though he receive Children, after
seven years of age, to the Communion, and mingleth warm water with the Wine in
the Eucharist, etc. The Nestorian, though he hold, That there are two Persons
in our Savior, as well as two Natures, etc. The Iacobit, though he signs
Children before Baptism, with the sign of the Cross, some in the face, some ^n
the arm, some in the breast, which badg of Christianity, they carry with them
to their grave, etc. The Cophti, or Christians of Egypt, though they baptize
not their children till 40 days after their birth, and then presently
Administer the Sacrament of the Eucharist unto them, etc. The Habassins, which
are the Ethiopians, a vast continent of Christians, as bigg as half Europe,
though they circumcise their children, as well as Baptize them, and so are Jews
from the girdle downward, though the cake of unleavened Bread which they
administer in the Sacrament, have five dents in it, alluding to the five wounds
of Christ, and that day they communicate, they do not spit till the Sun be set;
and the Emperor, when in his Progress, he comes to the sight of a Church, he
presently lights down off his Dromedary, and crawls a while on his knees, but
never remounts, till he be out of the sight of the Church, with other
Ceremonies of theirs, etc. The Armenians, who have more privileges in the
Turks dominion than any other Christians, though they deny the Holy ghost to
proceed from the Son, and receive infants presently after baptism to the
communion of the Eucharists etc. The Maronits that inhabit about mount Libanus
though they hold that human souls were all created together from the beginning,
that the father may dissolve the matrimony of his son or daughter if he mislike
it, Though they use to create children 5. or 6. years old Subdeacons, and
believe that no human creture enters the Kingdom of Heaven before the
general judgment etc. The Anabaptists, though they baptize not their children
till they come to years of dis^retion etc. The Presbyterian, though ^e be
against hierarchy, and the ce^emonies of the church and only ^n love with the
wealth thereof etc. The Hollanders though they allow a man to cohabit with a
woman all the days of his life, and if upon his death bed he marry her, it is
time enough to restore her honor, and make the children formerly begot between
them legitimate, etc. The Roman Catholics, though they Invoke Saints, and pray
for the dead, etc. All these, with sundry sorts of Christians besides, all the
while they have the Symbol of saving Faith, and same Apostolical Creed with
me, all the while they have the Decalog, and holy Scriptures, I have so much
Charity to hold that they differ from me, not as much in Religion as in
Opinion; (Now Opinion is that great Lady which sways the World) therefore I
wish that they might go up the same scale of bliss with me. Nor are the Swi^s
and Gritons to be hated, because they permit the Lutheran to preach in one end
of the Church, and the Calvinist in the other, yet in their moral civilities
and negotiations, they live peaceably together.

To conclude this discourse touching common Charity and Love, it is true my
Fellow-cretures, my Kindred and Friends have a great share of it, but I reserve
the quintessence thereof for my Creator and Savior, the one being the sea, the
other the spring of all felicity. I love my Creator a thousand degrees more
than I fear him, which makes me praise him more often than pray unto him; and
for matter of fear (as I displayed my self elsewhere) I fear none more than my
self, who am indeed my greatest foe, I mean those obliquities and depravations
which are my inmates, whereof the ill spirit takes his advantage, ever and
anon, to make me run into aberrations, so that I may say, I stand more in fear
of my self than of the devil, or death who is the king of fears. Now touching
this Elixer of love that I reserve for my Creator, it melted one morning into
these Stanzas:

As the parchd field does thirst for rain
When the Dog Star, makes Sheep, and Swain
Of an unusual drowth coplain,
So thirsts my heart for Thee.
As the chased deer does pant and bray
After some brook, or cooling bay,
When hounds have worried her astray
So pants my heart for Thee.
As the forsaken Dove does moan
When her beloved mate is gone,
And never rests while self-alone,
So mones my heart for Thee.
Or as the teeming Earth does mourn
In black (like Lover at an urn)
Till Titan's quickening beams return,
So do I mourn, moan, pant and thirst
For Thee, who art my last and first.

Soul. I am glad beyond measure to hear these discourses drop from you, first
that you make so good use of the objects of this Inferior world, as to study
your Creator in them, proceeding from the effects, to the search of the cause
which is the method of Philosophy, whereas the Theolog proceeds commonly from
the cause to the effect. The Pagan Philosophers by the twilight of nature soard
so high, that they came to discover there was a primus Motor, an Ensentium, an
optimus maximus, they came to know that he was ubiquitary and diffused through
the Universs, to give vigor, life and motion to all parts as I do in that body
of yours, though invisibly, if I may be so bold as assimilat so
incomprehensible a greatness to so small a thing; Now there is no finit
intellect can form a quidditative apprehension of God, no not the Angels
themselves. There may be negative conceptions of him, as to say he is immortal,
immense, independent, simple, and infinite etc. Or there may be relative
conceptions had of him, as when we call him Creator, Governor, King, etc. Or
there may be positive conceptions of him, as the chiefest Good, a pure Act, or
he may be described by an aggregation of Attributs, as, Merciful, Wise, Pious,
etc. But for the comprehensive quidditie of God, it cannot be understood by any
created Power; Among all these, one of the best ways to describe him, is by
Abstracts, as to call him goodness it self, Justice it self, Power, Pity and
Piety it self, He being the rule of all these; some of those ancient Wisards
among the Egyptians and Grecians came by reach of natural resons, to the
knowledge of one Incomprehensible Guide and conserver of the Univers; specially
Tresmegistus and Socrates, but they durst not broach their opinions publicly
for fear of the fury of the Peeple, among whom there was a kind of zeal in
those dark times; Plato flew as high as Socrates his Master in Divinity, and
among other Passages throughout his Works, there is one that is very pregnant,
for Writing to a friend of his, he says, When I write to thee seriously; I
begin my Epistle with God save thee, when otherwise, The Gods save thee;
Aristotle, Plato's scholar, courted Nature only, groping her secrets; a great
Philosopher he was, and no less a Sophister, he was the first that entangled
Philosophy with subtilties, coined words and Paralogisms, as the Classicans did
first distract divinity, so that it was no improper Character which one gave,
That Aristotle's school was a great skold;

Touching the celestial bodies I love you the better, that you are affected
with them so much, that you sometimes speculat and spel your Creator among the
stars. Now some of the Rabbis hold, that the word Jehovah (which is the
highest name of God Almighty, and pronounced publicly in the Synagog but once
a year) may be plainly made up among the Oriental stars. Nay, they affirm, that
all the Hebrew letters may be found in the firmament, which letters were the
true characters of the constellations before the Egyptians came with their
Hieroglyphics, and that the Greeks hois'd up such monsters so near the throne
of God, as Bears, Bulls, Lions, Goats, Rams and Scorpions; together with
pitchers and planks of rotten wood. They hold moreover, that the fate and
periods of Monarchies may be read, not only in Comets, but in those fixd stars
that are vertical over them. When Medusa's head was vertical to Greece, there
were diverse that presaged her destruction. Ierusalem's ruin was read plainly
among the stars, some years before. Nay, Postel, a Christian writer, takes God
and Christ to witness, that in the Hebrew characters among the stars, vidit
omnia quae in Rerum natura constituta sunt, he saw all things that were
constituted by nature. Doubtless that tongue which was spoken in Paradise, and
by the Almighty himself, may have some extraordinary privilege and mysteries
in it, nor was Postel lunatic when he broke out into such a protestation. But
the Authors of this opinion add unto it this caution, that he who will be a
scholar, and a proficient in this sydereal school to spel the stars, and
study this book (for the Heavens are called so in holy Scriptures) must be an
extraordinary pious, patient and prudent wel-wisd man, so he may find old
Orpheus words to be true, when speaking of God he sings,

-- (...),

(...).

Thy certain order does run immutable commands aong the stars:

Now, touching those ancient notaries of Nature, it may be well thought, those
large Ideas of knowledge they had, were illuminations from Heven, whence every
good and perfect gift does descend, therefore Erasmus cannot be much blamed for
canonizing Socrates for a Saint, so confident he was of his salvation; And it
were no profaness to say, That as the Holy Prophets were Harbengers to the
Second Person of the Trinity, so the Philosphers were the Heralds of the
First. Touching your Passions, Senses and Organs, though the first have been
Traitors so often unto me within doors, and the other Rebels without, yet you
apologize indifferently well for them; Age will take off their teeth and ougles
in time, for they are no other than wild Beasts; Insomuch, that it was not said
improperly of him, who having passed his gran Climacterique, viz. 63, said,
that he was got loose from his unruly Passions, as from so many Tygars or
Wolves. But I like it well, that you have so much of Hope and Love; Touching
the first, you say well, it maybe a cause of longevity, because it keeps the
Spirits in a temperat motion, and preserves them from wasting too fast; And
this may be one reason why Kings and Soverain Princes are not commonly so long
lived as others, because they have fewer things to hope for, and more things to
fear.

Touching the largeness of your Love, that it extends to a tender compassion
toward sensitive animals, it is a thing not to be altogether discommended in
you (though it may be smild at by some) nor are you alone herein, but there be
some Noble Christian Authors that are of your disposition, who say, that they
could find in their hearts to inveigh against the cruel, bloody and nasty
sacrifices of the Jews, had they not served as Types of the great Oblation for
Mankind; nor is your charitable large Love toward all those that bear God
Almighties Image, to be blamed, being well interpreted, specially toward
Christians, considering that they have the Decalog, wherein there are omnia
facienda all things to be done, and the Dominical Prayer, wherein there are
omnia petenda all things to be asked for, and lastly the Creed, wherein there
are omnia credenda all things to be believed; though the Roman Church be
accused to mutilat one of them. It Is true, there have been Haeretiques and
Hetroclits in Divinity from all times, specially in this doting age, and not
only in Divinity, but also in Philosophy, and Policy. The Church of Christ,
like Saint Peter's bark, must expect, in this troublesome World, to be tossed
with cross winds, and sometimes with tempests, which proceed from the light and
airy opinions of human brains; and while they think to make the said bark tite,
and stop the leaks, they make more holes in her; Others, going about to exalt
the Church, do raise her upon the Devils back; And the worst is, that Peeple
fall out about mere nicities, and extern indifferent forms; for though they
agree in the fundamentals and doctrine, yet they come to exercise mortal hatred
one to the other; but it has been so from the beginning: what a huge clash did
one little Vowel made in a great general Council, whether (...), or (...), was
more Orthodoxal; and what a huge gulf of separation is made now among
Christians, whether, in the holy Eucharist, we take panem Domini, or panem
Dominum; There may be garments of diverse fashions made of one stuff; the same
faith may admit of diverse rites; And indeed, it is very observable, how the
Genius of a Nation may be discovered by their outward exercise and forms of
Religion; The Romans, who had large souls, did always delight in magnificence
and Pomp, in stately Fabriques, in rich ornaments, in exquisit Music, in
curious sculptures and Paintings, in solemnities and stately Processions; all
these the Italians, who are extracted of the Romans, as also diverse Families in
Spain and France, do exercise in the practice of their Religion, thinking
nothing too costly and precious for their Churches, and that it concerns all
Arts to contribut their best, and most quintessential Pieces for the
beautifying thereof, wherein all others, who are under the Roman Church do
imitat Her; But there are other Peeple that have souls of another temper, they
care not for Exterior shows, and appearances of pomp, or for feeding the eyes:
And whereas the other Nations do deck, trim up, and imbellish Religion with the
rarest Ornaments, and richest Jewels and furniture they can find, to set a good
face upon Her, whereas they house Her in the stateliest manner they can,
adorning, perfuming and keeping her Temples as neat and decent as possible can
be, to draw the Peeple to a love and frequentation of them; The other sort of
Peeple put Her in homely plain attire, being loath to spend much money upon her,
least if devotion should produce too much wealth, the daughter would devour the
Mother. Touching the charitable conceit you bear toward those sects of
Christians which you have named, discovers a candid and charitable nature in
you, for though the number of the Elect be few, yet to confine them to one
clime, and coop them up in one corner of the Earth, is a presumption; Yet every
one should be so confident of his own religion, as to wish that all Mankind
were of the same as He.

I like it extremely well that you reserve the best and purest motions of love
for your Creator, who is the source and wide sea, who is the sum and center of
all happiness; This love you may be well assured will not be lost toward him
who takes delight in nothing more than in the good of his cretures, and to see
them do well; He is always more ready to open than they to knock, more ready to
hear than they to cry, more ready to bestow than they to beg; moreover I like
well those submissive and decent postures wherein you prostrat your self before
him, there can be no exces of humility in your comportment that way, the inward
man is known by the outward carriage, and when the members bow without, it is a
sign that the heart does so also within: I like it well also that your praises
are more frequent than your prayers; prayers bend God, but praises bind him;
prayer concerns our own interest, but praise aims principally at his glory,
and they who does truly preform this part of piety, may be said to discharge
the duty of an Angel upon earth; God, who is omniscious, knows all our wants
before hand, and what is fitting for us, therefore to be too importunat and
over-tedious in one prayer, to eflagitat him with reiterations of the same
thing discovers a doubting and diffident heart, therefore it more becomes a
Christian to be more vehement in praise rather than in prayer, the one issuing
out of the foggy vapors of sin, the other from the pure exhalations of piety
and gratitude, which sooner ascend to heaven; Therefore a Christian should not
stand always knocking and begging at the gates of heaven, but endeavor to
bestow some thing upon his Creator, and there cannot be a better gift than
praise, with expressions of thankfulness and with admiration of his longanimity
and love, of his preservation and providence, of his power and greatness; yet
prayer should have a longer preparation than praise, in regard by it we make
our addresses immediately to God in the second person, and familiarly speaks to
him as it were face to face; whereas oblations of praise are commonly in the
third person; Therefore under favor I do not much approve of their custom who
before and after meat, when their brains are full of worldly thoughts, and tied
to civil compliances do rush rashly into a speech with him in the second person
having no time for a fitting praemeditation; At such times a short ejaculation
expressed in the third person (though it be only mental if the case requiers)
may be more acceptable, and freer from presumption than a long grace, For among
those innumerable sins which man is subject unto, the sin in prayer, though
least thought upon, is one of the greatest, when without trembling
precogitations, God Almighty is spoken unto, and thou would in the Vocative case.
Now, those Benedictions, and strains of praises which are utterd in the
Nominative and other Cases, have a larger scope of boldness, and a greater
latitude of notion, they keep at a further distance, and consequently require
not so much reverence, and recollection of the thoughts beforehand, but may be
extemporal; It Is one thing to say God be praisd, another thing to say, O God I
praise thee: the latter requires much more premeditation, for one presupposes
he is as it were locally and presentially before him, though the first may have
as much of the heart, and be as effectual as the other. This makes me to take
some pains when I invoke God in the second person by my orison, to obstract my
self from all commerce with you for the present, and elevat my self upon the
wings of Faith in the sublimest posture I can toward Heven taking the choicest
affections and ideas with me along where I figure to my self a huge mountain of
most pure and inexpressible light wherein me thinks I discern a glorious
majesty, but the more I look upon him, the more he dazles mine eyes, that I
cannot make him a fixed object, or discover any shape in him, in regard of the
refulgencie of his glory; during this action, I endeavor to mingle with that
light, for true love is nothing else but an appetit of Union, and if I hold my
self to be a spark, or part of that light from the beginning, and to be dart
thence into that body of yours, and made a soul, may be no extravagant
speculation.

Now touching this last Notion, and the other concerning extemporall Prayer, it
is not uttered to give the least occasion of scandal to any other soul, but
only to intimat, that there are for Acts of Devotion, as well as for all
things else, fit places and times, where there may be a greater opportunity
for one to summon his spirits, to marshall his irregular thoughts, and raise
his affections toward that glorious object, to whom Prayer is directed.


Body. Dear soul, my spirits are raised to an exceeding great height of
comfort, that in the first part of this last discourse, you are pleased with the
method of my Devotions, and carriage toward Heaven; that I reserve my purest
and most intense Affections for my Creator, which I shall be most careful ever
to do, -- dum spiritus hos regit artus; He being my sole and soverain good; and
truly, I must tell you, that when by my lubricities, as by too free a genius in
the fruition of a friend or otherwise, I chance to have offended him, I can
never be friends with my self, till I am reconciled to him, and that I conceive
his countenance to be turned again toward me; yet, I had once a long fit of
dejection of Spirit that made me break out into these complaints, which you may
well remember, for they were Emanations from you.

Early and late, both night and day,
By moonshine and the Sun's bright ray,
When spangling stars embossed the sky,
And decked the World's vast canopy,
I sought the Lord of life and light,
But oh, my Lord kept out of sight.
As at all times, so every place
I made my Church, to seek his face;
In Forests, Chaces, Parks and Woods,
On Mountains, Meadows, Fields and Floods,
I sought the Lord of life and light,
But still my Lord kept out of sight.
On Neptun's back, when I could see
But few pitched planks 'twixt death and me,
In freedom and in bondage long
With groans and cries, with Prayer and song,
I sought the Lord of life and light,
But still my Lord kept out of sight.
In chamber, closet (swollen with tears)
I sent up vows for my arrears,
In Chapel, Church and Sacrament,
The soul's Ambrosian nourishment,
I sought the Lord of life and light,
But still my Lord kept out of sight.
What! is mild Heven turned to brass,
That neither sigh nor sob can pass!
Is all commerce 'twixt earth and sky
Cut off from Adam's Progeny?
That thus the Lord of life and light,
Should so, so long keep out of sight?
Such Passions did my mind assail,
Such terrors did my spirits quail;
When lo, a beam of Grace shot out
Through the dark clouds of sin and doubt
Which did such quickening sparkles dart,
That pierced the Center of my heart;
O how my spirits come again,
How every cranny of my brain
Was filled with heat and wonderment,
With joy, and ravishing content,
When thus the Lord of life and light
Did re-appeer unto my sight.
Learn sinners hence, it is never too late,
To knock and cry at Hevens gate,
That Begger's blessed, who does not faint,
But re-inforceth still his plaint;
The longer that the Lord does hide his face,
More brighter will be his afterbeams of Grace.
Thus at last I made mythridat of that Viper, which me thought had gnawed so
long upon my Conscience, which prompted me all the while of my dangerous
condition, and exhibited me my Quietus est at last.


Soul. I like it very well, that you make the Conscience your Guide, and that
you use to listen to his counsel; for he is my Dictator, and may be said to
have a coordinat Power with God himself. Therefore it is the chiefest part of a
wise Christian, to take his Conscience for his Admonisher here, least he become
his Accuser hereafter, He is Fraenum, and Flagrum, he is a bridle before, but a
Scourge after sin. But I hope, those turbid intervalls of grief and gripings
bettered you afterward; for confession and sorrow without amendment (as one
truly said) is like the pumping of a Ship without stopping the leaks: It is a
pithy and ponderous advice that an ancient Father gives, Commissa dole, dolenda
non commit, repent of things committed, and commit not things to be repented;
there is another saying, that administreth both comfort and caution, that if
sins present do not delight thee, sins passed will never destroy thee. There is
a third which reflects upon God and man; Qui promittit poenitenti veniam non
promittit peccanti poenitentiam. He who promises pardon to the penitent, does
not promise repentance to the peccant.

It behooves you now, that you have passed above seven Climacteriques; and seen
above seven and twenty hundred Saboths, to make a more exact and frequent
account with Heaven, for all the noble natural parts must grow less vigorous in
you (and so draw you to your end) specially the heart, which according to the
old Egyptian doctrine receives two dramms every year till it comes to 50, and
then decreaseth so fast to a 100, whence turning to its original weight it
makes no further progress; Therefore Rogus and urna meditanda, you must now
meditate on the pile and the pitcher, viz. on your windingsheet and grave: for
death may lie in wait for you in your shadow as you tread it. You must not now
thirst so much after humane knowledge, and spend your time in the school of
nature, by making such greedy researches into her causes and effects, you must
seek after Theological verities, you must not so much look after Jacobs staff,
as after his ladder. But in the search of divine mysteries, let me give you
this caution, not to affect skepticism too much, for it may make you guilty of
spiritual pride, the two gran sins which reign in these times. It is a wholesome
Rule satis est sapere ad sobrietatem. It is enough to be soberly wise, to be
contented to be of Gods Court, not of his Council, specially of his Cabinet
Council. Nor in adiaphorous things must you be to violent, strict and insolent,
or hating any to destruction.


Body. Well fare you now, and better may you fare hereafter, that you have so
much care of me, as it appears by affording me these instructions. It is a
while since that I have put them in practice, by employing my intellectuals to
Divine operations, and to give you some small instances, I will offer you from
among others, a few of the Psalms of the holiest of Men, and the first instance
shall be the verse that should precede all Prayers and Praises, which I have
made to run upon English feet as smoothly and as faithfully as I could,
diversifying it in four Stanzas, whereof the Reader may choose which he please.

PSALM 19. Verse. vlt.

1 O Lord my Savior and support,
Grant that the words and cries
My heart does vent, and tongue report
Be pleasing in thy eyes.
2 O let the notions of my mind
And words my mouth does yield,
Still in thy sight acceptance find
My Savior, strength and shield.
3 O Lord my Savior strength and might,
Grant that the thoughts and words
Be always pleasing in thy sight
My mouth and heart affoards.
4 O let the words my lips prolate,
And plaints my heart does pour,
Find favor at thy mercy gate
My Savior, strength and tower.
Now you shall receive some of the Penitential Psalms, which I hope I have not
murdered in the version, as others are said to have done.

PSALM. 51.

1 Some pity, Lord,
To me afford
Of thy abundant grace,
For thy great love
My sins remove
And trespasses deface.
2 Wash off the slime
Of this foul crime,
And thoroughly purge the blot;
For I confess
My wickedness,
I always see the spot.
3 O Lord against Thee
And only Thee
Have I committed ill,
That thy words might
Be counted right
And clear when judged still.
4 Lo, in a frame
Of sin and shame
Were knit my flesh and bone,
When I, alas,
An Embryon was
Of sinners I was one.
5 In the inmost parts
Of contrite hearts
Thou wisdom do demand,
And secretly
Thou shall make me
True wisdom understand.
6 With hyssop cleance
This foul offense,
And purge my soul from ill,
So shall I be
White in degree
To snow on Hermon hill.
7 O let me here
News that may cheer
My trembling heart with joy,
May free from groans,
My shatterd bones,
Broke by Thee with annoy.
8 O turn aside
Thy face, and hide
It from my foul offense;
And thoroughly blot
This ugly spot,
Ere I be sumon'd hence.
9 Renew my heart
In every part,
Thy saving Grace inspire,
So that my breast
May be possessed
With flames of heavenly fire.
10 Oh do not chase
Me from thy face,
Nor of thy spirit deprive,
For then should I
In misery
Be worst than thing alive,
11 Thy joys once more
To me restore
Of thy salvation,
So shall I preach
And sinners teach
The way to Hevens throne.
12 O Lord from blood
That cries so loud
For vengeance me defend,
So shall I still
With accents shrill
Thy noble deeds extend.
13 My lips unseal
For to reveal
Thy wondrous acts of old,
So shall my tongue
The saints among
Thy righteousness unfold.
14 Nor blood of lambs,
Or fat of rams
Are pleasing in thy sight,
Else would I come
With Hecatoms
Did thou in them delight.
15 The sacrifize
Which God does prize
Are hearts with sorrow bruizd;
A heart broke so
And split with woe,
Lord, thou have nere refused.
16 On Sion hill
O Lord, distill
Thy gifts in a good hour;
Build Salems walls
And keep from falls
Thy temple and her towr.
Here follows another in a differing cadence and Tune.

PSALM. 6.

1 Correct me not in rage,
Nor chastize me in ire,
But Lord thy wrath assuage,
And me with grace inspire,
For I am faint,
and all my bones,
are vexed with groans
Of just complaint.
2 My soul does also swell
For griefs that me torment,
But, Lord, how long, oh tell,
Will thou thy self absent?
Return O God,
Lord of all bliss,
For I do kiss
Thy smarting rod.
3 For in the shades of night,
No mortal can thee mind,
And in the pit what wight
To thank thee can thou find?
Behold my tears,
wherewith I drown
each night my down,
For old arrears.
4 My beauteous days are past,
For griefs that me dismay,
And like a flower I fade,
And wither quite away,
For fear of those
that me annoy,
and would destroy
Like deadly foes.
PSALM. 130.

1 OUt of the fluds,
Out of the sudds
Of sin I roar and cry,
Lord bow thine ear,
It Is time to hear:
My groans and agony.
2 If Thou observe
How often we swerve
From thee, who can abide
To stand before
Thy judgment door
To be arraignd and tried?
3 But there is with thee
Rich clemency
And plenteous store of grace,
Which makes Thee Lord
To be adored
So much by human race.
4 My soul for Thee
Incessantly
Waits as the Sentinel
Waits for the day
And Phoebus ray,
Nights darkness to repel.
Let Israel
Then boldly dwell
And trust in God above.
For there is with Him
Up to the brim
Abundant store of love.
6 For it is He
Can only free
And Israel forgive,
And of his crimes
Done at all times
An absolution give,

Soul. I am mightily well pleased that you employ your thoughts and words
(which are the chiefest Cretures of the mind) upon such meditations as these;
It much joye's me that you wind up your spirits to David's harp, a music that is
sweet and rich enough to be of consort with that of the spheres, specially if
your heart keeps touch with the tone for He is the truest penman of heavenly
things, who feels the joys thereof, while he is enditing them; Now, in those
holy Hymns of David's, there is a coincidence of Prayer, and Praise, which like
two currents falling into one channel, makes the stream the stronger. But to
enlarge my self a little further in that point whereon I insisted a little
before, touching the study of divine knowledge, which is the unicum
necessarium, I advise you again, now that you have stepped a good way in the
Autumn of your age, and that a little bark of yours has been tossed and
shattered with so many tempests, It were wisdom that you would think upon your
last Port, and ballast her accordingly to arrive thither; Therefore whereas you
have courted the Handmaids so long, you should now make your principal
applicatio^s to the Mistress, you should devote your self to the theory of
divine things, which is the true fruit of the tree of knowledge, whereas the
other are but the leafs thereof. Now Christianity of all other Religions has
the hardest and highest reaches, the purest Ideas and abstracted furthest from
sense, and harshest to flesh and blood, in regard of sundry transcendencies,
and mystical tenants she contains, as the Trinity, the Incarnation and
Resurrection, in the re-serches of which points the quickest sight, may be said
to be but one degree above blindness, therefore in the discussion and
investigation of these, it is fit that you make reason (whose uttermost ken can
reach no higher than the sphere of nature) to lie succumbent at faiths feet,
and so conclude certainties out of impossibilities, and God being omnipotent
may in justice demand such beliefs from us. Nor must you be too presumptuous by
prying into the Power, prerogative and nature of the Incomprehensible Deity;
for if all the fages that ever were yet in the world, could not come to the
knowledge of the least star in heaven, so far as to tell what substance she is
made of: how is it possible for any humane capacity to ascend so high, as to
the knowledge of the immense Majesty which created them; therefore the safest
and certainest knowledge touching God, is to confess, That we cannot know Him
in any perfection. Insomuch that that inscription which was found upon the
Pagan Altar among the Greeks was a very modest one, and may be said to be still
in date (...), To the unknown God: For the further that a finit Intellect does
launch forth into the boundless and bottomless sea of this co^templation, the
more he is in danger to go astray and loose it self, all human brain being too
narrow and uncertain a compass to steer the course by, though stars and Angels
contribute their help to direct him; Therefore it is a far securer way for a
sober minded Christian to sit down in an humble astonishment, and to vent forth
this interjection of wonder, O the inscrutableness and immensity of God, his
ways are past finding out etc. Therefore you must be modest in your indagations
this way, and cautious how you go awry into any by-path from the beaten road,
and so wander in the wilderness of your own imaginations: For it is the common
practice of the Devil, when it pleases God to give him the reins to punish a
nation, to tamper first with their intellectualls, and puzzle the brain with
new doubts, and peremptory conceits, till he leads them into a maze of
confusions, where at last he seizes upon them for their spiritual pride. You
must take heed of such an insobriety, and insolent zeal, but seek after
singleness of heart, rather than after singularity of opinion; Be wary also how
you meddle with classical divinity, but leave it to them whose holy function it
is to controvert such matters, and doubtless are specially inspired for that
purpose, employ your chiefest hours in penning or perusing things that may
elevat the thoughts above the Elements, and fill them with pious raptures; But
what Authors so ever you read whither old or new, whither Historical,
polemical, or paraenetical, take this rule along with you to believe Them for
the Holy scriptures sake, and the scriptures for Themselves. Antiquity is
venerable, therefore the older the Author is, the more to be valued, it being a
maxim that may bear sway in divinity as well as in Heralday, Tutius est cum
patribus quam cum fratribus errare.


Body. These are wholesome precepts that you give me which I shall conform unto.
And whereas in your former discourse you gave me an item of my age, and that
having now made a good step in the Autumnal part thereof, therefore Rogus and
urna medstands, it is sitting that the funeral pile and pitcher should be
thought upon. Truly, were it the custom of Christianity, and that when you have
left me, I must be reduced to my first principles, I could be well contented
that this small bottom of clay whereon the ravell'd and thrumb'd thread of my
life has been wound up so long, should be turned to earth and ashes by fire,
which is the noblest of the Elements, rather than by letting it putrify, and
be made a feast for ugly worms in the grave so long, and to be digested in
their maws. A conceit not altogether so extravagant as he who thought drowning
to be the gentlest way of goin^ out of the world, when the body b^ smooth
waving undulations glide^ softly to its last home. Let it not b^ termed a
vanity in me to tell yo^ that touching this Elementar^ world I have bin a good
while o^ of conceit with it, and had I b^lanc'd account with it, I could
wi^lingly pay nature her last debt, an^ render this small bag-full of bon^ to
the earth whence it first came ^ know there be sundry modes ho^ this debt is
paid, in some life go^ out like a lamp when the oil spent, and so takes a
gentle fa^well, in others life is puffed out violence, and so it commonly there
streams away in blood, or i^ thrust out at the postern door; in^thers, life is
starved away, in some in long lingering hectiques and s^ like diseases; some fall
like mellow fruit, others are plucked off; there be a thousand ways to go out,
but one way to come into this world: I have lived already to see such things
that former Ages never saw, nor future I believe, can ever see; I will confine
my self within the compass of these last fifteen years, only, wherein there have
happened the most prodigious revolutions, and horridst accidents, not only in
Europe, but all the earth over, that ever befell mankind since Adam covered
himself with fig leaves. I will begin with the fyeriest parts, with Africa,
where the mighty Habassin Emperor was met in nostile way, and slain, together
with his two Sons, in open field, by ^ common vassal of his, who had ^aised
military forces against him, and so made himself chief of that ^ncient and vast
Empire of Ethio^ia; The wild Tartar rushed through that four hundred mi^es huge
wall, which fever's China from Tartary, and so piercing the very bowels of that
luxurious and most delicate continent as far as Quinz^y (the celestial City as
they call her) and besieging the very palace of that most Eastern Monarch, he
caused hin to set it all on fire, and to do away himself violently with his
thirty Wive^ and Children, rather then he would become an inglorious Captis^
The great Ottoman Emperor, an^ head of the Musulmans was strangled by his own
slaves in the Seraglio. The Knez org^an Duk^ of Moscovia had some of his prim^
Nobles, and principal Officer hacked to pieces before his fac^ and their heads
being thrown into vessels of strong water, they were fixed upon poles, and made
t^ burn before his Court gate. I^ Naples a barefooted Fisherma^ made himself
the head of an Army in less then four days of 50000 men, and rendered himself
as absolute as any Monark: Two Provincial Kingdoms revolted quite from Spain,
viz. Catalonia on the one side, and Portugal on the other, renouncing all
obedience unto him. The Republic of Venice soly with her own strength of
tresure has wrastled seven years together with the great Turk. A King of Great
Britain, the Defendor of the Faith, and Head of the Church, had his head chopped
off in a Juridicall way. I live in a time that Englands chiefest Temples are
turned to stables and ster^oraries, that dogs have bin christened at the Font,
and horses ^ed on the Communion Table, with sundry other spectacles, then which
if I should live a thousand years longer, I think I should not see more strange
and stupendous.


Soul. All this that you say is too true, but there is nothing to be wondered at
now adays. It is a good while since that I have given over wondering at
anything; And the greatest wonder is, that peeple have bin so habituated to see
such strange things of late years that they have quite lost their wondering: But
it is the pleasure and permission of the great Architect of the world, in whose
sight the vastest Monarchies are but as so many mole-hils; he who transvolves
Empires and tumbles down Diadems as he lifts, that things should be so: nor
is all this and what daily happens, but the effects of that branch of our
daily prayer, Thy will be done.

Moreover, when I seriously contemplat the frame of this frail inferior world,
and find man to be the principall'st part of it; when (as I have touched else
where) I consider that fluxible stuff which goes to make him up, and that the
humors within him according to the elements are in perpetual agitation, man
will be man still, he will be subject to changes and innovation; As long as
the Moon shines above his head, and has that dominion over him that he cannot
cut a corn, or hair, or lop his tree, without seeking into her age: I say, as
long as that instable Planet makes impressions upon his brain, and those sluices
of blood that run up and down his body, he will be ever covetous of novelty,
and gaping after mutation, specially the common fort of peeple, who will find
some time or other to show what they are: now, touching the Moon, they that pry
into the influxes and operations of heavenly bodies, do observe that she has a
greater power over this Island then upon others, which causes the British
seas to swell up above fourscore cubits high in some places; Besides, daily
experience shows, that Empires, Commonwealths and Kingdoms, with all kind of
civil bodies as well as natural, are subject to distempers, to hot fevers,
to fits of convulsions and vertigoes: They have also their degrees of growth,
they have their consistences, declinings and Catastrophes: And indeed the world
it self which some held to be a great Animal, as well as its parts, has the
like, which is now come to its decrepit Age, the Infancy whereof may be said to
have bin from Adam to Noah, the Childhood from Noah to Abraham, the Youth from
Abraham to David, the Manhood from David to Christ; the old Age from Christ to
the Consummation: Insomuch that the older the world grows, the more subject
the parts thereof are to distempers, so that it is not to be wondered at, that
men grow worse, that charity grows colder, that morosity and peevish
inconstant humors reign more then ever, whereunto all revolutions, quarrels, and
preli^tions may be attributed, whereby peeple become active and eager oftentimes
in the pursuits of their own ruin, and in li^u of those Feathers which they
cried out before were such grievous burdens unto them, they draw sows of lead
upon their backs.


Body. To this the Pagan Poet has long since alluded, when he sung;

Hoc placet O superi vobis cum vertere cuncta
Propositum nostris erroribus addere crimen.
Thus O ye Gods, when ye intend to frame
New Governments, our errors bear the blame.
This make some cry out that the times are such that they are able to turn one
to an Epicurean, who was not such an Atheist as to think there was no God, but
that the sublunary things of this lower world were too mean for him to take
care of; Whereat another Poet glanced, when he said,

Non vacat exiguis rebus adesse lovi.

Soul. It Is true, there are some sort of crying black sins that reign now
adays, which are able to eclipse the Sun it self, and obscure the whole face
of Heaven; therefore I cannot be much blamed of being weary of your
consortship, and that I desire to be enfranchiz'd from that flesh, and made
free Denison in a better world.


Body. I confess, my dear soul, that you have little comfort to sojourn in me,
and I as litt^e to sojourn in the world as I said before; yet though I am not
so happy here as I desire, I am not so wretched as I deserve. There are many odd
extravagant humors that reign now adays, which make men to wander in the
wilderness of their own exorbitant fancies, and leave the beaten road; now, the
vialls of the Almighty's vengeance are various, but the sowrest and sorest are
those which fall upon the brain, when the ill spirit is permitted to intoxicat
the understanding, whereby some in searching after the the Truth, do overreach
it as far as others com far short of it. The world was never so full of fancy,
not only in divine notions, but philosophical also as now it is. Some
presumptuous overweening Sciolists to raise the tarrasse of Reason, would ruin
the battlements of Faith, they would make the miracles of Holy Scripture to
proceed from natural causes, they would make some asptaltique bituminous matter
to be the cause of the burning of Sodom and Gomorra; They would impute the
drowning of Pharoh and his army to a high spring tide; The passing over of the
Israelites to a low ebb and eddy water: They admire not the raining of Manna in
the wilderness, because there is good store found in Calabria, and other places;
They cannot believe that Lazarus was raised from the dead, but they must be
satisfied where his soul was all the while; They censure the miracle of making
the blind to see, because he saw men walk like trees, whereas he had never seen
trees before, having bin blind from his nativity: They think it strange the^
should be a Tree in Paradise so soon, in regard the text says positively that
the plants of the fields were not yet grown, because it had not rained; They
question whether the handle of Goliath's spear was as big as a weavers beam,
and whether David had so many hundred thousand talents of treasure: Moreover,
they cast blemishes upon Christian truth because general and great oecumenicall
Councels did so clash one with another: And that the Fathers of the Primitive
Church in diverse opinions were not only differing one from the other, but
dissonant to themselfs, as among other positions in the computations which they
make of the Years from the Creation of the world to the Incarnation, wherein
they are so discrepant; Nay, they would derogat from the Dictats of the Holy
Ghost himself touching some texts of Scripture, because in the second of Kings
we read Michal for Merah, as may be perceived by comparing it with the first
Book of the same History: As also because St Matthew has written Zachary for
Jeremy, chap. 27. Likewise that St Mark in the first chapter cites a passage
out of Isaiah which is recorded in Malachy: Moreover, when he says that our
Savior was crucified on the third hour, whereas St John says, Chap. 19. that
he was but only condemned by Pilat the sixth hour. So likewise where St Luke
says, that Cainan was the son of Arphaxad, and Salec the son of Cainan, the
place is contradicted in Genesis 23. where it is said, that Salec was not
Arphaxed's grandchild but his son, no other generation intervening betwixt the
two; And when ^^ is said Genesis the 11. that the Cave which Abraham bought was
in Sichem, being indeed in Hebron, and that he bought it of the sons of Emor
the son of Sechem, yet Moses says it was of Ephron the Hittite; Moreover
whereas he says that Emor was Sichem's son, it is said in Genesis 3^. quite
contrary, that Emor was Sichem's Father, and not his son.

Other supercritical spirits would cast aspersions upon Christianity, because
Constantin the first Emperor of that Religion was a very lewd man Gildas,
accusing him to have bin a murderer, a perjurer, the tyrannical whelp of the
unclean lionness of Dannonier's That likewise Clovis the first Christian king
of France was as bad, And that Henry the eight, the first reformed king, worse
then either of Them. There are others that have another kind of spiritual pride,
it being not only sufficient to Arrogat from the Holy Scriptures, to pick ho^es
in Christianity, and criticize so upon her, but while they go about to magnify
man, they detract from the chiefest instruments of Gods glory, and his
principal attendants the blessed Angels, by paraleling man's Creation to
theirs, and that they were made, as all things else, for man, whom they cry up
to be the Epitome of the world, and that the principal ministerial function of
the Angels is to guard him. Such as these may be said to be possessed with a
giddy kind of spiritual drunkeness, or madness rather; and touching those of
this last conceit, they are like the Cobbler who drunk himself into a kingdom
and thought himself a king while he continued in that humor.

Nor is Religion only troubled with such Critiques and Detractors, but these
times afford such in all sciences, to magnify their own fancies they slight
all Antiquity, they will not stick to call Plato a dotard, and Hippocrates a
quack-salver, thinking that they have more sublime notions then any. It is
true, that in some sense, restraining it to saving knowledge, a child that
understands his primer may be said to be more learned then all the Philosophers
that ever were, as the least fly, in regard she has a sensitive soul within
her, may be said in some respects to be more noble then the sun because he is
inanimat.


Soul. It is too true that the present times do swarm with such arrogant and
overcurious spirits, though they be full of doubts and still at a loss, going
after nothing else but more teaching still, yet they seem to have such a
peremptory certitude of their salvation, as if they had seen their names
registered in the book of life, expunging thence all other but their own. They
cannot modestly believe the Creed but they must know the very track that our
Savior went to Hell, they would string the rainbow and be satisfied what kind
of wood it is that the man of the moon carries on his back, etc. With a spirit
much like this was Scaliger possessed, who while he went about to amend the
times, and correct errors, committed as gross ones himself as any one Author he
condemns; he makes Dagon a woman, the Emperor of Habassia, Prester John; what
shallow conceits has he of the depth of the sea, and how poorly was he versed
in Cyclometria, how scurrilously he railes against whole nations, and would
understand nothing but what he liked?


Body. Truly I have bin ever averse to raise frivolous quaeres in any thing
specially in the essentialls of faith, or enter into disputes and altercations
or heat touching matters indifferent, I was never of their mind that against a
Cap and a Surplis would put on a Helmet, and Armor; I have bin contented to
follow the first road I was put in toward heaven, moving after the motion of
the superior orbs that were placed in the firmament of the Church, though not
altogether in an implicit way; I have always made Reason, and other sciences to
truckle under Divinity their mistress; I have taken as much spiritual delight
(let all this be spoken without vanity, or any scandal to other souls) in
other offices and holy duties of the Church as in Sermons; which makes me
reflect upon a saying of S. Lewis the French king, to Henry the third of
England, who asking him (in those times of implicit Faith) whether he would go
sooner unto the Eucharist or to a Sermon, he answered. I had rather see my
friend then hear him only spoken of; I have always inclined to love Order and
degrees of respect, and to abhor confusion, to love decencies rather then
slut^isness, nor I hope, shall I be ever of their gang who to avoid
superstition do fall into palpable profaneness.


Soul. I like you humor well touching all these particulars, nor will they
offend, I believe, any one that is of a s^ne and sober judgment; and concerning
the last thing you spoke of, it makes the Church Militant to be most like the
Church Triumphant, for in Heaven, which is nothing else but one great Temple,
there is among the Angels (which are compounded of Essence and Existence as you
and I are of matter and form) there is I say a most exact order. They are
divided to three Hierarchies and in every Hierarchy there are three orders; The
first consists of Seraphims, the second of Cherubims, the third of Thrones. The
second consists of Dominations, of Virtues, and powers; The third consists of
Principalities, of Archangels, and Angels; Now those of the supremest Hierarchy
partake of Divine illuminations in a greater measure then of the inferior, and
they one to another in respective manner, who are subordinat unto them; you and
I are created in a capacity to dwell in that Temple of Eternity, you after the
Resurrection, and I as soon as I part, with you, to see the face of my Creator,
and converse with those holy Angels by thoughts and looks.


Body. It Is hard for flesh and blood to believe that, considering the immense
distance which is twixt this ball of earth and (...) Empyrean Heaven, you
should so instantaneously arrive thither to behold the beatificall vision; For
the lowest neighbor to earth of all the celestial bodies which is the Moon,
is by the opinion of the best Astronomers computed to be 52. Semidiameters
distant from the earth, every diameter containing nere upon 3500. miles; so
that put case one could fly thither, and mount 100. miles an hour, yet he would
be above four months in his journey; moreover from the first sphere, the primum
mobile, put case a millstone should descend thence to the center, it would be
60. years a coming down, though it make 40. miles every hour as the prime of
Astronomer averrs; therefore under favor, how is it possible that you should
immediately upon your separation from me post up with such inexcogitable speed
up to Heaven, and behold the blissfull vision.


Soul. Touching the operations, the movements, and conveyancies of Spirits you
must know that they are instantaneous, and so wonderful, that the speculation
thereof strikes Philosophy dumb; They need no succession of Time or place, as
bodies require in their motions, they meet with no stop or resistance at all in
their passage: Now, if Light which is nothing else but dilated fire to the
utmost tenuity that can be, and comes nearest to the nature of a spirit of any
corporeal creature, if light I say does exercise its function with such an
admirable agility and suddennes as to expand it self from East to West over the
whole surface of the Hemisphere, what shall we think of Spirits that are far
fuller of activity: But you must understand, that when I am divested of you,
the wall of partition, that interposition is instantly taken away which stood
'twixt me, and my Creator, who is the Son of the Invisible world as that in the
Firmament which you see with the sensitive optiques here is of this Material;
therefore I shall immediately behold that infinitely more glorious Sun the veyl
of flesh being taken away, I shall be instantly within the Temple of glory,
whereof every Corner is filled with the light of his countenance, insomuch that
who is once in it, can never be able to go again out of it; Therefore though
the blessed Angels are employed up and down the world upon his service, yet
they are always within the verge of the Beatificall vision.


Body. Let it not be held a petulant, or impertinent curiosity in me, if I
covet to know, since you now speak of Angels, what degrees of difference there
may betwixt Them and separated souls in Heaven.


Soul. As they agree in many things, so they also differ in many; Angels and
separated souls agree in that both of them are spirits, both of them are
intellectual and eternal Cretures, They behold the blissful vision; They are
Courtiers of Heaven, and act merely by the understanding, The merits of Christ
was beneficial to both, it made the one capable of the state of glory, and it
confirmed the other in it that they can never be Apostats hereafter; besides,
(as some hold) at the day of judgment they are to receive augmentation of bliss
by being freed from further employment, cares, and solicitings for men, and
continue in an uninterrupted rest.

Now, as the blessed Angels, and separated souls, do thus agree, so they differ
also in sundry things; They differ in their very Essentialls; for the
principles of Angels are merely metaphysicall, viz. Essence and existence; but
a separated soul continues still a part of that compositum which formerly
consisted of matter and form, and is still apt to be reunited to the body, till
then she is not absolutely completed for all that while she changes not her
nature but her state: moreover they differ in the Exercise of the
understanding, and manner of knowledge, for a separated soul knows still by
discourse and ratiocination which an Angel does not; They also differ in dignity
of nature, for Angels have larger illuminations, and at the first instant of
their Creation they beheld the beatificall vision, yet separated souls are
capable to mount up to such a height of glory as to be like them in all
things, both in point of vision, adhaesion, and fruitio^.


Body. But when you are settled in that state of blissfulness, how can I expect
that you will desire to be united again, to re-efform so frail and foul a
thing as this body of mine; why may not I think rather that you will assume
some body of a nobler and more refined matter, according to the speculation of
him who imagined, that rational souls be they never so pious and pure, mount
not up presently after their separation from the corrupt mass of flesh to enjoy
the Beatificall vision which is the height of all celestial happiness; but
first they are carried to the body of the Moon, or some other Star according to
their degrees of piety and goodness in this life, where they enter into, and
actuar some bodies of a purer mould; and being refined then they reascend to some
higher Star, and so to some higher then that, till at last they be made capable
to behold the luster of so glorious a Majesty in whose sight no impurity can
stand; which fancy may be illustrated by this comparison, that if a prisoner
(as I touch elsewhere) after he has bin kept close in a dark dungeon for many
years, should be taken out and brought suddenly to look upon the Sun in the
Meridian, it would endanger him to be struck stark blind; So, no humane
polluted soul, sallying out of a dark dirty prison as the body is, would be
possibly able to appear before the incomprehensible Majesty of God, or be
susceptible of the fulgor of his all-glorious countenance, unless he be sitted
before hand by certain degrees thereunto which might be done by passing from
one Star to another; who, we are told in a good Text, differ one from the other
in glory, and consequently the creatures that are within them: Now, they who
please themselfs in this fancy adhere to their opinion who think that every
Star in heaven is peepled with some kind of creatures, which God Almighty has
pleased to place there for his honor and service, it standing not with his
providence that the concavities of those vast bodies whereof some are computed
to be many hundred of times bigger then the globe of the earth, should be empty
and void; therefore these Theorists frame a kind of scale of of creatures; they
place the Elementary lowermost, as the most gross: The Selenites or Lunary
peeple are of a finer composition then they, and as one Star exceeds one
another in height and glory, the creatures that are coloniz'd within them do so
accordingly, but the most immateriall, the purest, and the most intellectual
are seated in the Sphere of the Sun where the Almighty has settled his Throne,
and they are his nearest attendants: The Elementary Creatures have more matter
then form; The Solar have more form then matter, the Inhabitants of the Moon
with other Astraean colonies are of a mixed nature, and the nearer they
approach the body of the Sun, who is the fountain of light and heat, and the
glorious Eye of the world, the more pure and spiritual they are.


Soul. All this is but fancy, which although something of illumination and
sublimity may be in it, yet there is allo an extravagance in the Idea, nor is
it any way consonant to the orthodoxal Faith, therefore never fear that by
assumption of any other, I shall ever quite abandon that body of yours, but I
shall reserve not only an aptitude, but a willingness to have you for my
tabernacle again, and to be recompact; I shall be desirous to be a soul again,
till when I shall be only a Spirit; but that bulk of yours shall be refined and
sublimated to the perfection of Celestial matter, which is the purest and most
quintescentiall part of the whole body of matter: It is the Region wherein we
shall go in equal pace with eternity it self; therefore as man while he
sojournes among the Elements, bears a body suitable, congruous, and
sympathetique to them; so when he is exalted and made free Citizen of the
Heavenly Jerusalem, which is the true Country for which he had a being, he
shall be purified and ad^pted to the temper of it; wherein man shall not only
return to his first state of perfection, but to a far higher and greater
exaltation of glory; the (...) shall be no more (...) the Body shall be no more
a Sepulcher which may be the Etymology of it here, but it shall become a
perpetual Temple for the Holy Ghost; There his understanding shall not be
subject to error, nor his will to passion, incertitudes and topiques shall be
turned to de. monstrations, and Faith to intuition; provided, that he prepare
himself accordingly, and in this School of nature make himself capable to
remove thither; provided, that he make use of those means which his Creator
has prescribed him here, and that he employ his thoughts, words, and actions,
to that end; for man shall have degrees of happiness in Heaven according to his
works, though not for his works; which makes me reflect upon a passage that
happened in the reign of Edilred one of our Saxon Kings, who having changed
his Crown for a Friars coule, and his Court for a Cloister, went to visit a
Favorit of his that had bin a licentious young man, who telling the King that a
vision had appeared unto him the night before of two youths which he had seen,
one at his beds head with a white book thin written, the other at his beds
feet with a large black book blurred and very thick written; The King answered
that the meaning of this vision was, that the little book contained all his
good works, the other his bad, yet God was so infinitely merciful, that one
good work would cover a multitude of bad ones, for he never desired or
absolutely designed any Creature of his for damnation, etc.


Body. Yet there want not now adays such busy and profane spirits who rushing
into his secret Councels, do affirm that he has by his determinat will
preordain'd such and such creatures will they nill they for perdition; an
opinion then which we cannot conceive worse of the Devil himself.

But, my dear soul, you solace me beyond imagination, that you tell me, I shall
be reunited unto you, and made fit to share of your future beatitude; yet,
this, under correction, is a hard thing for humane capacity to apprehend; that
the very same entire body should be found out and recompacted, after such
putrefactions, after so many changes and revolutions; where can all the
splinters of a bone which a Cannon bullet has shivered and shattered to pieces
be found again? where can all the atoms which a corrasive has eaten from our
limbs be found? what cohaerence, what rejoinder, is there ever like to be
between a leg lost in Turkey, and an arm lost in India? The Shark and other
ravenous fish of the Sea; the Tiger, the Bear, the Crocodile, with other savage
beasts of the land use to devour, to digest and turn to chylus and so to
blood, the bodies of thousands of men, and that blood goes to the generation of
other such brute annimals, the worms do the like in the grave; Burnt bodies
are resolved into ashes, those ashes are blown into the gutter, that puddled
water is carried by common-shores into rivers, those rivers pay tribute to the
vast Ocean which runs in, and retreats by so many ebbings and flowings, how can
it enter into the brain of man that all the parts of these bodies can be
retreev'd to make up the same Compositum again?


Soul. I know that the most searching and sagacious wits that ever were, were
all at a loss when they meditated on this transcendent mystery, nor can the
common principles of philosophy herein be preserved by any strength of Reason,
for they are bones that Nature cannot digest: But (as I told you before) in
the scanning of divine mysteries we must oftentimes infer certainties out of
impossibilities, as also that God is omnipotent, otherwise it were not just for
him to require such beliefs at our hands; Moreover, to illustrat unto you a
little this article of the Resurrection, you must understand that as at the
Creation there was a separation of the Chaos that huge indigested lump which
went to the making of all cretures, so, after the last fire has reduced all to
their first principles and calcined them to ashes, there shall be a separation
of that confused mass of ashes by the same all powerful hand, there shall be a
kind of second creation, and rallying of the individual bodies which were
formed at first, and every soul shall enjoy her first consort, though much more
purified then it was before.


Body. You raise my heart to an exceeding great height of comfort, me thinks
you imp this dull body, with eagles feathers to fly upwards, by telling me that
after this transitory life which hangs upon such small filaments of sister
thread is cut off, I shall be wrought into you again.


Soul. To make this point a little more perspicuous unto you, you must consider
that matter taken singly by it self has no distinctive form at all there is an
indifference and homogereous identity runs through the whole bulk of Matter; it
is the substantial form which is the soul that does give a distinguishing
shape and numericall individuation to every Body; now, as long as she
continues the same, the creture is still the same; For that Body of yours
though you have not the same flesh about you, nor the same blood in your veins
which you had twenty years ago, yet is it still the same body as long as I
inform it; For as the Bucentoro in Venice is held to be still the same vessel
though having bin so often upon the carine, new caulk'd, ribb'd and plank'd,
she may not have any of the first timber she was built of in the first dock; In
like manner humane bodies continue still the same as long as the same
Individuator is in them which is the soul, notwithstanding, that they are in a
continual fluxibility, and a kind of succession of consumption and
restoration; for although the flesh and blood in no man be the ^ame in his
youth as it was in his Infancy, nor the same in his manhood that it was in his
youth, because they use to wast away by the intern principles of heat, as also
to transpire, breathe out and evaporate insensibly through the pores to make
still room for fresh nourishment which is concocted and so converted to new
blood, and new flesh, yet is the whole body always numerically, and
individually the same, as long as the same soul does inform and actuat it; So
at the general resurrection what part or parcel so ever of that indifferent
^omogeneous huge mass of calcined earth and ashes which my Creator shall assign
me to reinform, it will be the very same that you bear about you now, though
much refined, and so we shall cohabit eternally, without any future divorce.


Body. The Revolution of Plato's great year seems to have some analogy with
our Resurrection, whereof that divine and high soaring Philosopher might have a
glimps when he held, that after such a period of years the world should be
repeepled by the same Cretures; which makes me think (now that you have
quickened my spirits) with these plesing ideas) upon the witty answer of the
Tapster at Botley, who having filled two pots of ale to a poor scholar as he
was returning from Wales to Oxford, and the scholar telling him that he had
spent all his money in his journey, but he would pay him the next time they
met, The Tapster asked when that would be, why said the scholar if it be not
sooner, we are sure to meet here again at the revolution of Platoes great year,
for at the period of so many thousand years all things return to their former
state, you and I shall meet here just as we do now, with the same bodies and
minds, for so the world has continued hitherto, and will so renew for ever;
why then said the Tapster you and I met here so many thousand years ago, yes
said he; I thank you for putting me in mind of it, for I remember you left then
two pots of ale upon the score, pay me for them first, and then I will trust
you for these two.


Soul. It cannot be denied but those great students of nature though they were
soly guided by her twilights, had many glances of divine illuminations: Now
touching these mysterious tenets of christian religion, it is with them as with
the body of the Sun, there is somewhat in that glorious Planet (according to the
comparison of a very ancient Father of the Church) which we may behold, if we
will b^e contented to see that, we may freely do ti: But there is somewhat in the
Sun, that may not be looked on; now, if we be not satisfied to see what we
may see, we may chance come to s^e nothing at all, for he that gazeth and
setleth his optiques too fixedly on the Sun, comes to see nothing at all, for
he loses his eyes: So the mysteries of saving Faith, there is much in them that
may be apprehended by the faculty of Reason, and by what is revealed unto us,
but if we will not be contented with that, but pry further, we may not only be
dazzled, but struck stark blind; therefore we must contemplat them with
reservednes and sobriety: This may be also paralelled with the Moon; There is
somewhat in the opacous orb of the Moon, that no mortal yet could ever come to
the knowledge of it: The Astronomers by all their curious inspections, and
optic instruments cannot tell what are the spots, what the darkness is, that
goes interwoven in the body of the Moon, though she be nearest neighbor to us
of all the heavenly: But there is somewhat in that Planet, which we can tell
what it is, and it is the luminous part, by that it affords us light to know
what it is; So in the high points of salvation, there be some dark parts that
are not comprehensible, and there be other parts that are comprehensible; the
first we may boldly look upon, but for the other, the dark and abstruse parts,
we must close our eyes, and sit down with admiration, and comfort our selves
that we cannot understand them, That there is something in this great work which
concerns us, yet it is impossible to be comprehended: Touching the parts which
may be understood, we may look on them with a modest eye of inspection, but the
parts that are obscure and cannot be looked on, we must not be overcurious to
find prospectives to look into them, but believe them; let it satisfy us that
they cannot be discerned by mortal eye, in regard it is the pleasure of God
not to have them known, let us be contented to be ignorant of that which God
would have us to be ignorant of, till our Faith be turned to intuition, and
where the understanding shall be adaequate to Truth, as Truth is the adaequat
object of the understanding, which must be in the other world, in that true
Region of intellectual light, where such abstracted speculations that so much
puzzle us here, shall be as clear as the Sun in the Meridian, where we shall
conceive the true sense of the ninth of the Romans, of the Apocalypse of Saint
John, and all other passages of holy Scripture without an Interpreter, and not
to be subject to false judgments, constructions, or glosses.


Body. What an unutterable kind of joy do I feel running through all the veins
of my heart, to hear that this flesh of mine shall rise again to be worn, and
actuated by you, and to partake with you of that knowledge, and blissfullness
which so far surpass all my senses, and your Imagination I believe as yet!


Soul. I do not say you shall rise, but you shall be raised, for solus Christus
resurrexit, alii suscitati, Christ only did rise again by the power of his
Godhead, all others shall be raised; that same body of yours shall be raised
the same in substance not in quality, for it will be made purer and freer from
Corruption; as I during the time of my separation on I shall not change my
nature but my state; I may be said to have no integrity, but remain as a part
of you till our reconjunction, whereunto I shall still incline and propend,
because you were the instrument whereby I became first a soul, which may be the
cause that all the Saints in Heaven do so much long after the day of Judgment,
because they may be reunited to their bodies, and by that consortship have a
fuller fruition of bliss. Those eyes of yours shall then receive their reward
for their liftings up to Heaven, those hands of yours for being instruments of
charity; those ears of yours for their attention to holy duties, those knees
of yours for their bendings in Gods holy house, that mouth of yours for
receiving the blessed Sacrament in such humiliation; that tongue, heart, and
brain of yours for their praises and ejaculations, and all other parts of yours
that were the interpreters of your piety, shall all then receive their reward
in the Temple of Eternity.


Body. But after your recesse, and separation from me, let it not be esteemed
a too overbold curiosity, if I desire to know whether you will give then a
final farewell to Earth, and be seen no more in the Elementary world, because
there be so many stories told of spirits that walk to discover hidden tresures,
to detect murders, etc. As also that they have appeared in Churchyards and
Charnell houses.


Soul. Touching this speculation and doctrine of walking of Spirits it has
gravel'd the highest wits both in Divinity, and Philosophy, they are all put to
a nonplus, concerning the latter, they would produce natural reasons why in
Cimitiers and other places they sometimes appeer; and one is by the example of a
vegetall body which being burnt and reduced into ashes, the form of the same
numericall plant by a curious Artist may be revived visibly to the eye of the
beholder, and made to start up out of those ashes being shut u^ in a glass,
and heated in the bot^tome, in regard that the fixed fa^ (though much of the
volatile hat^ flown away) remains there still so a humane body or cadaver being
reduced to ashes in the grave, b^ the heat which the penetrating beams of the
sun insuseth therinto, the shape of the said body may be exhaled up and made to
appeer in the air.

Now touching the Theologues, the common opinion is that it pleases God
Almighty to give the Devil a privilege and permit him to assume any shape, that
of man not excepted, whereby he deludes, and makes compacts with the weaker sort
of peeple to destroy their souls; for there is no Creture that the Devil
maligneth, and hates more then mankind, in regard he succeedes him in the
beatitude that he lost; which makes some Divines hold, that when that number of
Angels which fell, and were tumbled down to Hell is filled up by humane souls,
the day of judgment will come; But, as I said before, the ill spirit has power
by Gods permission to transform himself to sundry shapes and to transfer that
power to his petty cacodaemons and imps to beguile and inveagle the simplest
sort of mankind, and most commonly women the weaker vessels, who sometimes out
of a desire of revenge, and to wreck their malice, sometimes for lucre, and some
petty supplies of money use to indent and make pactions with him though always
without a witness; And hereof these times afford more instances then ever any
age did, therefore whosoever denies there are such kind of actual delusions,
and ill spirits, shows that he himself (as was said elsewhere) is possessed
with the spirit of contradiction and obstinacy; For there are no nations new or
old but have published laws against such who adoperat, and make use of the
devil for the ends before mentioned, as also for other curiosities and
predictions, (...) against them; There are Edicts in France, and Acts of
Parliament in England against such who invoke ill spirits, and make any
contracts with them, whereof the very instrument and deed has bin discovered in
diverse places with the Devils claw for his signature; together with the
injunctions that he laid upon them before hand, which in the Romish Countries
are, that they must first renounce Christ and the extended woman (meaning the
blessed virgin) they must contemn the Sacraments, tread on the Cross, spit at
the Eucharist, etc. As I have noted else where. Therefore without any
controversy there are airy spirits that hover up and down perpetually about us;
But when I shall become a spirit which will be immediately, upon my dissolution
from that body of yours, I hope I shall appeer no more in this Elementary
world, till I attend my Savior at the day of judgment, to fetch you up also to
Heaven, as soon as we part from one another here you shall return to earth
whence you first came, and I to God that gave me, you to your common Mother,
and I to the Father of lights whence as a beam of immortality, I was sent to
quicken, organize, and inform that body of yours, and make it capable of
heavenly beatitude in time, being refined, and fitted first for that purpose; I
thank my Savior, I have that within me which assures me hereof, I am not left
to such incertitudes and anxietie that have any thing of despair in them, such
that an Italian Prince expressed when being upon his death bed and comforted by
his friends touching the joys of the other world whereunto he was going, he
fetched a deep groan and said, Oh I know what is passed, but I know not what is
to come; much like another in the same condition who said Dubious vixi, anxius
morior, quo vadam nescio, I lived doubting, I die anxious, I know not whither I
go; To these may be added an odd speech of a French Baron not long since, who
meeting two capuchins going barefoot in cold frosty weather with their scrips
upon their backs a begging, and knowing them to be gentlemen of a good family,
He said, How grossly are these men cosen'd, if there be no Heaven: That of
Rablais was not so bad as this, who being upon his death bed, and the extreme
unction applied unto him, a friend of his who had come to visit him among other
passages of consolation wished him good speed for he was upon his journey, to a
good Country, viz. to heaven, He answered, so it seems, that I am upon a
journey, for you see they are lickering my boots already to that purpose: but
that which is fathered upon Paul the third is beyond all these, when he said
upon his death bed that shortly he should be resolved of two things, whether
there be a God, and Devil, or whether there were a Heaven and Hell; Therefore
Earth may be said to be worse then Hell in one respect, because it bear's
Atheists, which Hell does not, but rather converts them, in regard they feel
God there by his judgments, and begin to have an historical faith of him, which
here they had not. Nor am I of that drowsy opinion to think that I shall sleep
all the while among the common mass of souls in some receptacles ordained I know
not where for that purpose till I be rejoined unto you; Nor does the Religion I
am of, admit of any suburbs in hell as purgatory and other places where I must
be purified some years before I ascend to heaven; As Fray Julian of Alcala does
averr upon record (which is made authentic) producing other spectators
besides himself, that he visibly saw the soul of Philip the second going up to
Heaven in two ruddy clouds some two years after his death at such an hour of
the night.


Body. Let not my Soul be offended if I be curious to know something touching
that most comfortable point of the immortality of the Soul; and this curiosity
does not arise out of any doubt, but a desire to be further confirmed therein;
because there be some busy Spirits that stumble at it, alleging that it is
but a new tenet of Christian Faith not established in the Church till the
latter Lateran Council, and pumping out other quaeres and cavils concerning
this Article.


Soul. It is in Divinity as in Philosophy; for as it was said long since that
in this an impertinent Skeptic may blurt out a question which all the Sages of
Greece were they alive, could not answer; So in Divinity, an irresolute,
inconformable stubborn spirit may raise doubts that the whole Academy of
Christian learning cannot solve, such Pyrrhonians, and perverse spirits have
bin in all Ages, there are no principles can tie them; their brains may be
said to be like a skein of thrumb'd small thread, any thing will entangle
them, and their thoughts like a bush of thorns that takes hold of any thing;
they are never satisfied either in points of faith or the operations of nature,
like him who would have found something to shear off upon an egg. This may be
called one of the truest sorts of superstitions, whose etymology is super stare
to stand too precisely and peremptorily upon a thing, specially things
indifferent, and to be over hot either in the abolition or maintenance of them
to the destruction of whole Nations, as also in recerches after supererogatory
knowledge, and interpretations of Scriptures, whereby they would make the Holy
Spirit speak what he never meant; whereas the moderat, and submiss sober minded
he or she are the best proficients in the school of Divine knowledge.

But whereas you say that you desire to be strengthened and illuminated further
touching the imateriality, and consequently the incorruptibleness and
immortality of the Rational Soul, Let me tell you that not only Christian
Divines but the best of Pagan writers both Poets, Philosophers, and Orators
have done Her that right. One calls Her -- Divinae particulam aurae. Another
sings, Igneus est olli vigor, and coelestis imago; Another Men's infusa Deo,
mortalis nescia sortis. And Cicero among other has a remarkable saying to this
purpose, si erro, credendo Animam esse Immortalem, libenter erro; If I err in
believing the soul to be immortal, I willingly err. Moreover the
Intellectual humane soul does prove Her self to be immortal both by her
desires, her apprehensions and operations; Her desires are infinite, and still
longing after eternity; now there is no natural passion given to any finit
Creture to be frustraneous; Her apprehending of notions of Eternal truth
which are her chiefest employment and most adaequat objects, declare her
immortal; Al corruption comes from matter and from the clashing of contraries,
now, when the soul is severed from the body, she is beyond the sphere of
matter, therefore no causes of mortality can reach her, there is nothing in her
that can tend to a not being: Her operations also pronounce her immortal,
which she does exercise without the ministry of corporeal organs, for they
are rather a clogg to Her; she does use to spiritualize material things in the
understanding, to abstract ideas from all Individuals; she is an engine that can
apprehend negations, and privations, she can frame collective notions, all
which conclude her immateriality, and where no matter is found there is no
corruption, and where there is no corruptibleness there must be an immortality;
now her prime operations being without any concurrence of matter, she may be
concluded immortal by that common principle, Modus operandi sequitur modum
essendi: for in the world to come the state of the soul shall be a state of
pure Being, nor will there be either action or passion in that state; whence may
be inferred she shall never perish, in regard that all corruption comes from
the action of another thing upon that which is corruptible, therefore that thing
must be capable of being made better or worse, now, if a separate soul be in
her utmost final estate that she can be made neither, it follows she can never
lose the being she has; Moreover, since the egress out of the body does not
alter her Nature but only her condition, it must be granted that she was of the
same nature while she continued incorporated, though in that imprisonment of
hers, she was subject to be forged as it were by the hammers of material
objects beating upon her, yet so, as she was still of her self what she was;
Therefore when she goes out of the passible ore wherein she suffers by reason of
the foulness and impurity of that ore, she immediately becomes impassible and a
fixed subject of her own nature, that is, a simple pure Being; Both which
states of the soul may be illustrated Sir K.D.
in some measure by what we find passes in the coppelling of a fixed metal,
for as long as any lead or dross, or any allay remains with it, it continues
melting, flowing, and in motion under the muffle, but as soon as they are
parted from it, and that it is become pure without mixture, and single of it
self, it contracteth it self to a narrower room, and at that instant cease
from all motion, it grows hard, permanent, and resistent to all operations of
the fire, and admits no change or diminution in it is subject by any extern
violence; so the Rational Soul when she departs from the drossy ore of the body
and comes be her single self, she becomes as it were exalted gold and to be
perfectly by her self; she can never be liable any more to diminution, to
action, passion, or any kind of alteration, but continues fixed for ever.

Add hereunto that every humane Soul is still breathed, and immediately created
by God Almighty himself, for though the sacred Code tells us that he rested
from all his works the sixth day, yet touching Rational souls he may be said to
be still a perpetual Agent touching their creation, not any creture else to
concur in that work, as he uses to do in the production of mortal and
corruptible cretures.

Therefore there are none but they whose souls s^ar no higher then their senses,
but may feel within them an immortal essence, the apprehension whereof is as
irksome to the reprobat, as it is comfortable to the Elect.


Body. Let me not be held too bold a skeptic if I desire to know whether you
carry with you to the other world the knowledge you had here, and reserve it
still?


Soul. Yes, I shall bring along with me the habit of all the science, and
intelligible species that I had here, and get an infinite addition of more, for
I shall not arrive to the full use of my understanding till then; I shall
retain also the habit though not the operations of the Vegetall and sensitive
souls as I did in the time of information when I was embodyed: I shall still
know things by Ratiocination and discourse, which Angels use not to do; I shall
become an indivisible substance exempt from place and time, yet present to
both, my activity shall require no application to either of them, but I shall
be mistress of both, comprehending all quantity whatsoever in an indivisible
apprehension, ranking all the parts of motion in their complete order, and
knowing at once what is to happen in every one of them, whereas when I was
immersed in the body, and confined to the use of exterior senses, I could look
but upon one definit place or time at once, needing a long chain of various
discourses to comprehend the circumstances of any one singular action.

My capacity shall not be confined to the small multitude of objects, which
division and time gives way unto, I shall be a self Activity, an essence free
from all encombrances oftime; For to be subject to Time, or comprehended in
Time, is to be one of those movables whose Being consisting in motion takes
up part of Time, and uses to be measured by Time, which belongs to Bodies; But
when I shall become a Spirit, and have my operations entire, as being nothing
but my self, I shall be absolutely free from Place and Time, though both do
glide by me and under me, Insomuch that all which I shall know or do, I shall do it
at once with one Act of the understanding, therefore I shall not need time to
manage and order my thoughts as when I was affixed to that orb of yours, nor
shall I need any extrinsecall mover, or the work of fancy, or any previous
speculations residing in the memory; I shall be a simple and self-subsisting
form, a cement, and miroir to my self.


Body. These high abstracted notions do far transcend the short reach of of my
sensitive faculty, but, under favor, you speak only of your activity and
increase of knowledge in the life to come, I would be glad to hear something of
the joys and blissefulnes thereof.


Soul. These, as they are beyond expression, so are they beyond all
imagination, that vast sea of felicity which I am capable to receive, cannot
flow into me till those banks of earth be removed; The joys of Heaven have
length without points, breadth without lines, depth without surface, they are
even and uninterrupted joys, and to endeavor to relate them in their
perfection, were the same task as to go about to measure the Ocean in Cockle
shells, or compute the number of the sands with pebble stones.

Touching these faint and fading earthly pleasures, we covet them when we need
them, and the desire languisheth in the fruition; moreover, worldly things when
we want them we use to love them most, but less when we have them; meats and
drinks they nauseat after fullness, carnal delights cause sadness after the
enjoyment, all pleasures breed not only a satiety but a disgust, and the
contentment terminats with the act: It Is otherwise with celestial things, they
are most loved when they are enjoyed, and most coveted when they are had, they
are alwaiesful of what is desired, and the desire still lasts, but it is a
desire of complacency and continuance, not an appetite of more, because they
are perfect of themselves; Yet there is still a desire, and satiety, but the
one finds no want, nor can the other breed a surfeit: The higher the pleasure
is, the more intense is the fruition, and the oftener repeated, the greater the
appetite will be; whence this inference may be made, that there can be no
proportion at all' twixt the delights of a separate and an embodyed Soul.

But it must not be forgotten, that as good Souls being become purely
spiritual, and beatified as soon as they are separate from the body, do by
their simplicity and acuteness apprehend and enjoy the blisses of Heaven in
their true nature, beyond the extent of quantity, and above all conceit of
fancy: So a damned Soul being a simple Act also, and nothing but Spirit, does
apprehend and endure the torments of Hell, with all the activity, subtlenesse
and energy that can be, still receiving new strength and vigor to be able to
lie under the said torments: And as the assurance of a succeeding eternity
delights the one, so it does torture the other. Moreover, as the greatest
strains of anguish which torments the one, is to have lost Heaven, so one of
the highest conceptions of joy to the other, is to have escaped Hell; Insomuch
that Heaven in some sort may be called the Hell of the damned, and Hell the
Heaven of the Blessed.


Body. Let it not be termed a presumption in me, if I desire to be rectified
in one point, that considering the humane creature is finite, and temporary,
and that all which proceeds from him is so, how can it stand with the justice
of Allmighty God, whose will is the Rule of Justice and equity, who also is the
source and sea of mercy, how can it stand, I say, with his goodness, that there
should be such a disproportion betwixt the offense and the punishment, as to
punish his poor frail finit creature with infinite and eternal torment?


Soul. This has bin a quaere much scanned and discussed in the very infancy of
the Church, which made one of the Original Fathers thereof out of excess of
charity, to think that the damned souls, and Devils should be saved at the
day of Judgment. But you must consider that though humane transgressions are
finite, yet they are committed against an infinite and eternal Majesty; and
had the sinner who committed them lived eternally, he would have sinned
eternally; Besides the reward which is reserved for humane souls is infinite
and eternal, therefore it is just the forfaiture thereof should be so to the
forfaiture of Heaven, one dram of whose happiness is more then the whole mass
of all earthly contentments; One drop of whose abstracted, pure, permanent and
immarcessible delights is infinitely more sweet then all those mixed and muddy
streams of corporeal and mundane pleasures, then all those no other then
Vtopian pleasures of this transitory world were they all cast into a li^beck,
and the very Elixir of them distilled into one vessel.


Body. Me thinks, I feel that small triangle of flesh which beats toward the
left side of my breast dilated with excess of joy to hear this discourse touching
your immortality, being so infinitely happy that I have so precious a guest
within me, specially when I look upon the former discourse you made touching the
Resurrection, and that I shall be also fitted to be reunited unto you in the
Region of Eternity: moreover these patheticall expressions of yours have filled
me with thoughts of Mortification, whereof I shall endeavor to show some future
symptoms; A salad or posie gathered in a Churchyard shall be more pleasing to
me, and that my shirt be dried there hereafter rather then in a garden;
therefore I desire that you would join with the rest of the separated souls in
Heaven that the time of my reunion with you may be hastened; And so, good morrow
to my soul.

Upon this the Nun vanished into me I know nor how, and diffused Her self
through all the cells of my brain, and through the whole mass of blood among
the spirits; Now, it is observed that it is the practice of Humane souls in
time of sleep and the silent listening night to go oftentimes abroad, and
exercise their abstracted notions, as also to try here (as it was touched
before) how they can live separate hereafter by these noctivagations. It is
recorded of Julius Casar that he dreamed to have layn one night with his
Mother, and I may be said to have layn with my Soul; By his mother was
interpreted the Earth the common parent of all, and it was presaged of him by
that Dream that he should be Conqueror of the world, which proved true; so I
hope this dream may foretell that I shall conquer this little world of mine,
For both Divines and Philosophers make every Man a Microcosm or little world of
himself.

And now 'twas high time for me to awake, which I did.


For, lo, the golden Oriental gate Sp.
Of gray-fac'd Heaven 'gan to open fair,
And Phoebus like a Bridegroom to his mate
Came dancing forth, shaking his dewy hair
And hurles his glittering beams through gloomy Air.
So Rest to Motion, Night to Day does yield,
Silence to Noise, the Stars do quit the Field:
My Cinque Ports all fly open, the Fantasy
Gives way to outward objects, Ear and Eye
Resume their office, so does hand, and lip,
I hear the Carrmans wheel, the Coachmans whip;
The prentice (with my sense) his shop unlocks,
The milk maid seeks her pail, porters their frocks,
All cries and sounds return, except one thing,
I hear no bell for Mattins toll or ring.
Being thus awaked, and staring on the light
Which silvered all my face and sight,
I closed my Eyes again to recollect
What I had dreamed, and make my thoughts reflect
Upon themselfs, which here I do expose
To every knowing soul; And may all those
(Whose brains Apollo with his gentle ray
Has molded of a more refined clay)
That read this Dream, thereby such profit reap
As I did pleasure, Then they have it cheap.
Est sensibilium simia somnium.
