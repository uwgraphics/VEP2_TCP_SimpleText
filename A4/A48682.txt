A LIST of the Parliament of WOMEN.
FOrasmuch as by the Laws of Nature, Women have a great share in the Creation,
and that they eat, drink, sleep, talk, and do all the other Deeds of Nature,
and natural Acts, as well as Man, having, to their great grief, seen the vile
miscarriages of the Lordly and domineering Creature, Man, who has very
tyrannically excluded them from both Arts and Arms, and suffered none of them
to use any other Rapier, but a Needle, nor any Lance, but a Distaff, nor
suffered them to come into the Pulpit, or to the Bar, though they have believed
always, and do still believe, that they are able both to preach and plead, as
well as many Men, having the member of the Tongue as loosly hung, and as long,
brood, and exact, in all its dimensions, as man's; and they have also had, and
still have a firm belief and opinion, that their Hearts are as big, and contain
as much spirits and stoutness as man's; and also that their Skulls are as full
of brains, and have as much wit and subtilty, as any Man whatsoever. All this
being Ta^ely and seriously considered; and having also read of the famous
Amazonian Kingdom, on the Banks of Thermodoon, and how well they were able to
rule and manage the Affairs of the Commonwealth; and also, that among their
Noble Ancestors, the Ancient Cauls and Saxons, the Women used to sit as Judges,
and had a great stroke in the Affairs, and management of the Commonwealth. And
now seeing the many miscarriages of late of the Men of this Kingdom, and that
they have not ordered their Affairs to the content of all; and believing, they
could manage Matters much better, they have, with one Consent, laid their Heads
together, and resolved to congregate themselves, and to meddle with the Affairs
of the Commonwealth, and to place themselves at the Helm of Government, and to
endeavor to regain-their long lost Liberty. And having lately searched all the
Records of Vtopia, they found an Ancient Writ of Queen Mabs, which they have
sent to all Parts, both of City and Country, for the Women to choose their
Representatives, forthwith to repair to London Bridge, and there to sit, and
order the Affairs, for the Good of the People, and for the Honor, Welfare,
Reputation and Benefit of Womankind. In pursuance of this Ancient Writ of
Queen Mabs, the several Places both City and Country, have chosen their Female
Representatives, a List of whom, as they came to our Hands, are here published.

The whole Number amounting to 174. according to the Summons of the aforesaid
Writ, met together at a convenient Place on London Bridge, whose roaring Noise
was most agreeable to the Harmony of their Tongues, and which they politickly
chose, that it might allay the shrill Thunder of their Voices, which else would
too loudly resound over the City, to the Affrightment of the Men. After much
Debate, and great Disputes, they at last chose the Lady All Tongue for their
Speaker, and so Adjourned till the next Week: What Acts, Speeches,
Remonstrances, Bills and Orders, may be performed, made and done by them, Time
will produce.
