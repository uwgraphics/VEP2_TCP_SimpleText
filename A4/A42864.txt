The Glory of these Nations.
Or, King and peoples happiness, being a brief Relation of King Charles's
Royal progress form Dover to London, how the Lord General and the Lord Mayor
with all the nobility and Gentrey of the Land, brought him through the Famous
City of London to his Palace at Westminster the 29. of May last, being his
Majesty's birthday, to the great comfort of his Loyal Subjects.

The Tune is, When the King enjoys his own again.


Where Is those that did Prognosticate,
And did envy fair Englands State;
And saidKing Charles no more should Reign;
T^^^^ Predictions were but in vain,
F^^ the King is now returned
(...) fair England mournd.
(...) (...)es Royally him entertain,
(...) ^^essed be the day
^^^s do his Subjects say,
That God has brought him home again.
The twenty second of lovely May
At Dover arrived Fame does say,
Where our most Noble General
Did on on his knee's before him fall.
Craving to kiss his hand.
So soon as he did land
Royally they did him enertain
With all their power and might
To bring him to his Right,
And place him in his own again.
Then the King I understand
Did kindly take him by the hand,
And lovingly did him embrace,
Rejoicing for to see his face;
He lift him from the ground
With joy that did abound,
And graciously did him entertain,
Rejoicing that once more,
He was o'th English shore,
To enjoy his own in peace again.
From Dover to Canterbury they past,
And so to Cobham-Hall at last;
From thence to London march amain,
with a Triumphant and glorious Train,
Where he was received with joy
His sorrow to destroy.
In England once more for to reign,
Now all men do sing
God save Charles our King,
That now enjoyss his own again.
At Deptford the Maidens they
Stood all in White by the highway,
Their Loyalty to Charles to show,
They with sweet flowers his way to strew;
Each wore a Ribbin blew,
They were of comely hue;
With joy they did him entertain
With a clamations to the sky,
As the King passed by,
For joy that he receives his own again.
In Wallworth-Fields a gallant band
Of London-Prentices did stand
All in White Dublets very gay,
To entertain King Charles that day,
With Muskets, swords and Pike,
I never saw the like,
Nor a more youthful gallant train,
They up their Hats did fling,
And cry God save the King.
Now he enjoys his own again.

At Newington-Buts the Lord Mayor willed
a famous Booth for to be builded,
Where King Charles did make a stand
And received the sword into his hand,
Which his Majesty did take,
And then returned back
Unto the Mayor with love again;
A Banquet they him make,
He does thereof partake,
Then marched his Triumphant Train.
The King with all his Noblemen,
Through Southwark they marched then.
First marched Major General Brown,
Then Norwich Earl of great renown
With many a valiant Knight,
And gallant men of might,
Richly attired marching amain.
Th^se Lords Mordin, Gerard and
The good Earl of Cleavland,
To bring thee King to his own again.
Ne^r sixty flags and streamers then
Was born before a thousand men,
In Plush Coats and Chains of gold,
These were most rich for to behold
With every man his Page,
The glory of his age,
With courage bold they marched amain,
They with gladness they,
Brought the King on his way
For to enjoy* etc.
Then Liechfields and Darlyes Earls,
Two of fair Englands Royal Pearls;
Major General M^ssey then
Comman^^d the Life guard of men
The King for to defend,
If any should contend,
Or seem his coming to restrain,
But also joyful were
That no such durst appear,
Now the King, etc.
Four rich Maces before them went,
And many Heralds well content.
The Lord Mayor and the General
Did march before the King with all,
His Brothers on each side,
Along by him did ride;
The Southwark-Waits did play amain,
Which made them all to smile
and to stand still a while,
and then they marced on again.
Then with drawn swords all men did ride,
and flourishing the same then cried
Charles the second now God save.
That he hi^ lawful right may have,
and we all on him attend,
From dangers him to defend:
and all that with him does remain
Blessed be God that we
Did live these days to see
That the King, etc.
The Bells likewise did loudly ring,
Bonefires did burn and people sing,
London Conduits did run with Wine;
and all men do to Charles inclineline,
hoping now that all
Unto their Trades may fa^l,
Their Famylies for to maintain
and from wrong be free,
'Cause we have lived to see
The King enjoy his own again.
FINIS.
