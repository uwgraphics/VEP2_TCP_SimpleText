LONDON, Printed for Rowland Reynolds in the Strand, 1680.

A LETTER FROM THE King of Morocco, etc.
WHen these Our Letters shall be so happy, as to come to your Majesty's sight,
I wish the spirit of the righteous God may so direct your mind, that you may
joyfully embrace the message I send, presenting to you the means of exalting
the Majesty of God, and your own reward amongst men. The Royal Power alloted to
us, makes us Common servants to our Creator, then, of those people whom we
Govern; so that observing the duties we owe to God, we deliver Blessings to the
World; in providing for the Public good of Our States, we magnify the honor
of God, like the Celestial bodies which though they have much Veneration, yet
serve only to the Benefit of the World. It is the excellency of our Office to
be instruments, whereby happiness is delivered to the Nations. Pardon me Sir,
this is not to instruct, (for I know I speak to one of a more clear and quick
sight than my self) but I speak this, because God has pleased to grant me a
happy Victory over some Parts of those rebellious Pirates, that have so long
molested the peaceful Trade of Europe; and has presented farther occasion to
root out the Generation of those who have been so pernicious to the good of our
Nations, I mean since it has pleased God to be so Auspicious to our beginnings
in the Conquest of Sally, that we might join and proceed in hope of like
success in the War against Tunis, Algier and other places (Dens and Receptacles
for the Inhumane Villainies of those who abhor rule and Government) Herein
whilst we interrupt the corruption of malignant spirits of the World, we shall
glorify the great God, and perform a duty that will shine as glorious as the
Sun and Moon, which all the earth may see and reverence, a work that shall
ascend as the perfume of the most precious Odours, in the Nostrils of the Lord;
a work grateful and happy to man
