THE Granadiers Loyal Health.
A SONG.
The First Line of these Notes to be Sung Twice over.
OLd England's Glory now begins,
Under the best of Gracious Kings;
Ill Fates which many years have frowned,
With smiling Conquest now has Crowned;
And put an end to all Dispute,
Against our Gracious King and Duke.
II.
The Royal Line for to enlarge,
For Rupert we have got Prince George;
Of Conduct and of Courage known,
To his Immortal praise alone;
We Will drink the Health e're we go hence,
Both to the King, the Duke, and Prince.
III.
We Will Front the Guards with Fire and Sword,
For to defend our Sovereign Lord;
Let flat-fac'd Oats like Sodom burn,
Mahomets Saint, and Christians scorn:
While Rebels here in Mourning lurk,
Because the Christians Banged the Turk.
IV.
Make ready Links, take your right Foot
Out of the Stirrup, then fall! to it:
Recover your Muskets, Charge the Front
To The Right and Left, there is Lives lies on it:
Blow your Matches, fire your Fuse,
We Will make the Rebels fly like Jews.
V.
Hand your Grenades, let 'um fly,
Like Thunder flashes from the Sky;
Like Fire-drakes or some Blazing-Star,
Which are true Signets of sweet War:
We with our Hoboys, Gun, and Drum,
Shall make Mars Harmony where we come.
VI.
Toth' God of Wine let us now descend,
Old Bacchus that true Souldies Friend;
Where Mars often fails, he still Inspires,
Both Heart and Brain with Warlike Fires:
Come brush about that smiling Bowl,
To Albermarle and his great Soul.
VII.
Come Bowl about Boys, while we stay,
Two in a Hand to Loyal Gay;
And Daring Parker true and stout,
And Hestings must not be left out:
Heroic Boys, when Whiggs did Sway,
They feared not Monmouth, Tom, and Gray.
VIII.
Howard and Sack field for the Crown,
They Will make our English Turks come down,
And send 'em unto Tecklets Gang,
There let 'em either Starve or Hang:
A score of Bumpers round the Board,
To Christians and Victorious Sword.
IX.
Hark! Hark! I hear the Drum
Beat Rad-dan, their Majesty's come;
Wind up your Bottoms, clear the Bar,
See what is the Reckoning in the Star:
Whilst Whiggs Designs are all debarred,
Come Fellow Soldiers to the GUARD.
FINIS.
