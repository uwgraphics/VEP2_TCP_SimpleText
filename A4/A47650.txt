The Noble Resolution delivered in a Paper thrown over the Scaffold (at
Edenborough) by Patt. Leithe, etc.
Good People,
KNow it is not for the general business that I am to suffer this untimely
Death, as it would appear, but I take it as a just Judgment from Heaven for
particular gross and grievous sins committed against the great God and
Supreme Ruler of Men and Angels; who has oftentimes (to his glory be it
spoken) brought me through many dangerous and huge difficulties, in so much,
that few days (for a long time together) escaped me, but I have looked Death
on the face, and by assistance from the Almighty, shall now outbrave him: yet
such was the mercy of God toward me, that I not only have been preserved, but
successefully returned with Victory: and though I was ever so ambitious of
Honor, that to purchase it, I never declined the worst of dangers, yet was no
one drop of my blood ever drawn to this hour: but now, because (through
ambition, my greatest sin) I robbed the Lord of his Honor, as the justest
judgment that could befall me, I am brought here to lay down my Head at the
mercy of a poor simple hangman; and I do it with much cheerfulness, for I
am thoroughly sensible of the happy difference betwixt this death, and that in a
Field, where men's fiery spirits breathe nothing but fury and heat of blood; and
what adds most to my comfort is That I suffer for so honorable and just a
Cause, as only for my Loyalty and zeal to my dread Sovereign, whose sad
condition I more grieve at, then ten such Deaths; for it goes beyond all
admiration, that understanding people should be so much infatuated with the
delusions of some particular Noblemen and Ministers, who govern for the time
at their pleasure; and doubtless have a large account to make to the knower of
the secrets of all hearts, as all this while not to undisguise these masked
zealots, who under the pretense of maintaining Religion; and the Kings Honor,
have sufficiently undone the one, and unavoydeably will ruin the other: I
speak not this out of a repining or resenting humor; for were it not the
pleasure of the all commanding God, who alone has power of Life and Death,
that I should in this way bid farewell to the World, though environed with
Armies, I could not perish: And therefore I freely forgive whatsoever wrongs I
have received from men, and beseech Heaven never to lay my blood to their
charge, but heartily prays for their remorse, and that the Lord would not
only in humility turn their hearts toward himself, but likewise give them
loyal hearts and stainlesse Affections to their just, lawful, and natural
Prince, and unite both his and theirs to the highest, who is above all Kings
and Monarchs: if I have spoak any thing ignorantly, I beseech my Redeemer to
forget and forgive that sin also, amongst the rest of my many heinous offenses:
And I implore the Father of mercies, that of his infinite goodness he would be
pleased to restrain the Coaleblowers and hatchers of this unnatural War,
and grant that their power may prove ineffectuall for the time to come, from
further shedding of innocent blood, and tyrannical oppressing and destroying
the Subject, and make them penitently sensible of their proceedings against
both God and his Vicegerent.

My last service to those two invincible Noblemen HUNTLEY and MONTROSSE who
have been most faithful and true Subjects to their Master) my Cordial
respects to my Lord GORDON, my Parents, and him that should succeed me, I
recommend to the Royal Protection of His Majesty, to whom I have been ever
Loyal, and for whom I lay down my head most heartily to the Block: My Soul I
bequeath to my Maker, through whose tender mercies, and the merits of my
Savior JESUS CHRIST I hope and am confident to enjoy everlasting life.

PATT. LEITHE of Hearthill.

FINIS.
