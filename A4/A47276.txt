A Mournful ELEGY, On the Deplorable, and never enough to be Lamented Death, Of
the Illustrious, and Serene CHARLES the II. KING OF Great Britain, France, and
Ireland, etc.
Defender of the True, and Apostolic Faith; who Departed this Life, (and
changed his Corruptible CROWN for an Uncorruptible,) on Friday the 6th of
February, between 11. and 12. of the Clock, in the Forenoon, being the 55 th.
Year of his Age. 1684/5
Come,

Of
Consecrate your Eyes before you Weep,
Afterward, let not your Sorrow Sleep:
Rivers down, of Mournful Tears, and true,
Orient Pearl, but Occidental Hew:
Let
Under
Since
Lamentations give our Passions Vent,
Unparalleled Discontent,
Sovereign CHARLES can not our Grief prevent.

Dear, yet
Urged,
Sure
S mec (at first) eclipsed his Sky;
E ngland knew his Soveraignity:
Cross, and Loss refined (by Britains Blush,
Unknown) him to a pure Nonplus.
N on such Mournful Subjects Sings;
D read Sovereign; Mirror of all Kings.
Unawars, Nine Kingdoms he Subdued;
Steadfast Preace to Commonwealths Renewed:
Mild,
And
Great,
Not
AE nea's
Meek, yet Fierce, if once but set on Edge;
Absolute, if much provoked to Rage:
Good, and Just, as any Prince could be;
National, nor Partial; yet was he
AEqual; Tossed by Land and Sea.

As
No
B ritains Bane, he Storms did Undergo;
Rout he quite did Overthrow:
Intestine, at Home did vex him much;
Terror and Relief of Dane and Dutch:
A tlas high, yet as a Valley Low:
New Event could Turn him to and fro:
No
In
Ethereal
Northern Mists could Darken his Bright Day:
I reland none could make him loose his Way:
AEquity was all his Plea.

And
Retire, and Loyalists draw nigh;
Eyes, with Sable Tears and cry,
forced the Helespont to Roar,
X erxe's Army Landed on our Shore.


Could Orphans Cries, or Widows Tears Prevail,
Or Loyal Sighs our sudden Straok Assail;
Or Monarch's Groans recall our Dismal Fates,
Which Grief renews, and Joy Obliterates:
All Christian Kings in Europe then would cry
For Sovereign CHARLES, his Sacred Majesty.
It Is Grief to see that he who did restore
Peace to so many Kingdoms, and the Whore
That Is clad in Scarlet, should so soon be gone,
Before his Sun approached the Horizon.
The Morning of his Age it was o'recast,
His Bright Star with Mar's Fiery Nose Oppressed;
But 'ere his sun ascended the Noon Day,
Both Clouds and Comets Vanished quite away:
And ever since we borrowed splendent Rays
Of Brightness, to add Luster to our Days.
In Heaven-portending Prodegies I find
Star-Gazers (in their Judgments) are but Blind;
Since they did see the star that did Presage
His Death, who was the Phoenix of his Age,
Dazel'd with Brightness of his Royal Sky,
Applied it not unto his Majesty.
But since our Sore, a Salve along does bring,
God Save Great JAMES, our second Sovereign KING.
Let his Dominions Preface Black with White;
Since Rising Phoebus dissipates our Night:
Let Loyal Subjects then both Cry and Sing,
Like Birds Revived in the returning Spring.
Let Court and City Shout, and-make a Noise,
And Loyal Sighs still Echo back Rejoice:
Till Plotters all Conspiracies lay by,
And Treason turn to purest Loyalty.
