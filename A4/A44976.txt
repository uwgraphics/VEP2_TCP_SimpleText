The humble GRATULATION AND PETITION Of diverse His Majesty's Faithful Subjects
of the true Protestant Religion, within the County Palatine of Lancaster.

With His Majesty's Answer thereunto.

YORK: Printed by ROBERT BARKER, Printer to the Kings most Excellent Majesty:
And by the Assigns of JOHN BILL. 1642.

To the Sacred Majesty of our most gracious Sovereign Lord, Charles, By the
Grace of God, of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland King, Defender of the
Faith, etc.
The humble Gratulation and Petition of diverse His Majesty's Faithful Subjects
of the true Protestant Religion, within the County Palatine of LANCASTER.
Most Gracious Sovereign,
THe most real and convincing Testimonies of your Princely care for the
Advancement of Gods true Religion in your Majesty's Realms, and the common Good
of all your Subjects, could no less then draw from us (who have hitherto in
these stirring times sat still) this humble Acknowledgement of our due and
necessary Thanks.

WE, with the inmost and choicest thoughts of our Souls, do esteem and prize
your Majesty's most Righteous Intentions of Governing your Liege people,
according to the wholesome Laws of this Kingdom, a thing so often, and with such
earnestness avowed by your Sacred Majesty, whereunto we yield that hearty
Credence which is due to so Religious and Righteous a Prince: We do also with
all humility and thankfulness acknowledge your manifold and evident
Manifestations to the world, that you affect not an Arbitary Government, but
the Common Prosperity and Happiness of all your Loyal Subjects, by your
readiness to join with your Parliament in a speedy raising of Forces for a
timely suppression of that odious Rebellion in Ireland; By your late
Proclamation, for the putting in due execution the Laws against Papists; By
your most gracious condescending to the desires of your Great Council, in
signing the Bills, for the Trienniall Parliament; For relinquishing your title
of Imposing upon Merchandise, and power of Pressing Soldiers; For the taking
away of the Star Chamber, and high Commission Courts; For the Regulating of the
Councel-Table; As also the Bills for the Forests and Stannerie Courts; with
other most necessary Act. Moreover, we are consident and well assured of your
Majesty's Zeal for the advancement of the true Protestant Religion, and with
inexpressible joy do understand your most Christian and Pious Resoluton for the
preservation of those powerful encouragements of Industry, Learning, and
Piety, the means and honor of the Ministry, for the maintenance and
continuance of our Church Government, and solemn Liturgy of the Church of long
continued, and general Approbation, of the most Pious and Learned of this
Nation, and of other Countries, composed according to the Primitive Pattern, by
our blessed Martyrs, and other Religious and Learned men: As also your gracious
pleasure, That all Abuses of Church and State shall be Reformed, according to
the Model of Queen Elizabeth's days, of ever blessed and famous memory; by the
one you have weakened the hopes of the Sacrilegious Devourers of the Churches
Patrimony; (if there be any such) And by the other, at once provided against
all Popish Impieties and Idolatries, and also against the growing danger of
Anabaptists, Brownists, and other Novelists; and which Piety, Love, and
Justice, we beseech God to return into your Royal Bosom. But yet (most
Gracious Sovereign) there is one thing that sads our hearts, and hinders the
perfection of our happiness, which is, The Distance and Misunderstanding
between your Majesty and your Parliament; whereby the hearts of your Subjects
are filled with Fears and Jealousies, Justice neglected, Sacred Ordinances
profaned, and Trading impaired, to the impoverishing of many of your Liege
People. For the Removal whereof, we cannot find out any lawful means,
without your Majesty's assistance and direction.

Wherefore, we humbly beseech your most Excellent Majesty, to continue your
most Christian and Pious Resolution of Ruling your People according to the Laws
of the Land, and maintaining of the same; of being a zealous Defender of the
established Doctrine, Liturgy and Government of our Church, from Heresy,
Libertinisme, and Profaneness, an Advancer of Learning, Piety and Religion, an
encourager of painful Orthodox Preachers; and whatsoever your Parliament shall
offer to your Royal view, conducing to this blessed end, the common Good and
Tranquillity of your Subjects, to be pleased to condescend unto, and graciously
to confirm; And withal to declare unto us some expedient way, how we may make
a dutiful Address unto your Parliament, for the taking away of those
Differences and Impediments which stay the happy Proceedings of that most
Honorable Assembly, whereof your Majesty is the Head (which once removed, we
doubt not but you will speedily be as near your Parliament in Person, as in
Affection; That there may be a blessed Harmony between your Highness and that
great Council) and we shall, with all alacrity, observe the same: Humbly
tendering our Lives, and Fortunes for the preservation of your Royal Person,
Crown, and Dignity, according to our bounden Duty, and Allegiance, and
heartily praying for your Majesty's long and prosperous Reign over us.

At the Court at York, the sixth of June 1642.
His Majesty has commanded me to give you this His Answer to your Petition.
That He is very glad to find such real Acknowledgements of those great
Graces which he has bountifully bestowed upon this His Kingdom of England, in
the time of this Parliament, and likewise it is a great contentment to him to
find so many true Sons of the Church of England, as by your expressions in the
saw Petition both plainly appear to him; Assuring you, That he shall not yield
in His Zeal and Constancy for the maintenance of the true Protestant
Profession, neither to Queen Elizabeth, nor to His Father of ever blessed
memory, both against Popish Superstition on the one side, and Schismatic
Innovation and Confusion on the other. In the last place, as he does take in
very good part your desire of a good Understanding between His Majesty and His
two Houses of Parliament, so likewise He cannot but much commend the way that
you take therein: And as for your Directions, if you will but seriously
consider His Majesty's Just and Necessary Desires expressed in His Answers and
Declarations since His coming to York, your Zeal and Knowledge will not need
more particular Instructions to make such Addresses to both Houses of
Parliament, as the times require, and befitting such loyal and true affected
Subjects to your King and Country, as this Petition expresses you to be.

FINIS.
