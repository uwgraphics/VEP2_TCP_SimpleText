To Mr ROBERT WHITE HALL at the Wels at Astrop.
PRorogued term prolongs our meeting,
Accept then Robin this for greeting,
As much as if in Belgic Roomer,
We drank all Astrop this hot Summer,
W' have cured the Scurvy, yes and a-Toe,
By sending Ano-waters (...),
I have seven Doctors, not in Rockets
That ply the Waters, but in pockets,
But that so many Dunnes and Leeches
Have drained quite my Physic breeches,
Ab ipso font, not, that is cooler,
But in Bottles Trio-bolar
We daily tope, rare cure Sple-netick,
By Diaphor and Dieu-retick.
Under my Room, that is high you will say,
Are men of Via lactea,
Which every morning come to clear-um
With whey, which some call Lactis serum.
I am a water-Ratt, my skill is
To follow thee and Doctor Willis:
For if these prove not good as Spaw,
Or Tunbridge, then I must have Law,
When our Vice Chancellor we speedily greet,
For these I write are my best feet:
And so have at thee, I am bouzing
In bottles six that is half a dozen,
Which makes us frisk like any Satyrs,
But not with wood Nymphs, no such matters;
Keep with thy Gallants and their Paddyes,
For we want nothing, not your Ladies:
And now as any thing of Fame,
So Astrop waters change their name;
Their Cures into their Titles go,
As Rivulets to the seas flow;
Wherefore whatso'ere your dosing cupp
Seems to power out at Asterop.
It ends in sovereign; under seal
Declared the Pan-obstruction-Heale
Like to a Prince in triumph seen,
Over Scurvy, Stone, Astmas, and Spleen:
Therefore let none my friends defeat you
Potate strenue, and Valete.
E. G.
