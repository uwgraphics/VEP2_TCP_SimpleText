By the King,
A PROCLAMATION.
JAMES R.

WE have received undoubted Advice, That a great and sudden Invasion from
Holland, with an Armed Force of Foreigners and Strangers, will speedily be made
in a Hostile manner upon this Our Kingdom; And although some false Pretenses
relating to Liberty, Property, and Religion, contrived or worded with Art and
Subtilty, may be given out (as shall be thought useful upon such an Attempt) it
is manifest however, (considering the great Preparations that are making) that
no less Matter by this Invasion is proposed and purposed, then an Absolute
Conquest of these Our Kingdoms, and the utter Subduing and Subjecting Us and
all Our People, to a Foreign Power, which is promoted (as We understand,
although it may seem almost Incredible) by some of Our Subjects, being Persons
of Wicked and restless Spirits, implacable Malice, and desperate Designs, who
having no Sense of former Intestine Distractions, the Memory and Misery whereof
should Endear and put a Value upon that Peace and Happiness which has long
been enjoyed; nor being moved by Our reiterated Acts of Grace and Mercy,
wherein We have studied and delighted to abound toward all Our Subjects, and
even toward those who were once Our avowed and open Enemies, do again
endeavor to Imbroil this Kingdom in Blood and Ruin, to gratify their own
Ambition and Malice, proposing to themselves a Prey and Booty in such a public
Confusion.

We cannot omit to make it known, That although We had Notice sometime since,
that a Foreign Force was preparing against Us, yet We have always declined any
Foreign Succors, but rather have chosen (next under God) to rely upon the true
and Ancient Courage, Faith and Allegiance of Our own People, with whom We have
often ventured Our Life for the Honor of this Nation, and in whose Defense
against all Enemies, We are firmly resolved to live and die: And therefore We
solemnly Conjure Our Subjects to lay aside all manner of Animosities,
Iealousies and Prejudices, and heartily and cheerfully to Unite together in the
Defense of Us and their Native Country, which thing alone will (under God)
defeat and frustrate the principal Hope and Design of Our Enemies, who expect
to find Our People Divided, and by publishing perhaps some plausible Reasons of
their coming hither, as the specious, though false Pretenses of maintaining the
Protestant Religion, or Asserting the Liberties and Properties of Our People,
do hope thereby to Conquer this Great and Renowed Kingdom: But albeit the
Design has been carried on with all imaginable Secrecy and Endeavors to
surprise and deceive Us, We have not been wanting on Our Part, to make such
Provision as did become Us, and by Gods Blessing We make no doubt of being
found in so good a Posture, that Our Enemies may have cause to repent such
their rash and unjust Attempt.

We did intend (as We lately Declared) to have met Our Parliament in November
next, and the Writs are issued forth accordingly, proposing to Our selves,
amongst other things, that We might be able to quiet the Minds of all Our
People in matters of Religion, pursuant to the several Declarations We have
published to that effect, but in regard of this strange and unreasonable
Attempt, from Our Neighhouring Country (without any manner of Provocation)
designed to divert Our said Gracious Purposes, We find it necessary to recall
Our said Writs, which We do hereby recall accordingly, Commanding and
Requiring Our Loving Subjects to take Notice thereof, and to surcease all
further Proceedings thereon; And forasmuch as the approaching Danger which now
is at hand, will require a great and vigorous Defense, We do hereby strictly
Charge and Command All Our Loving Subjects both by Sea and Land (whose ready
Concurrence, Valor and Courage as true Englishmen We no way doubt in so just
a Cause) to be prepared to defend their Country; And We do hereby Command and
Require all Lords Lieutenants, and Deputy Lieutenants to Use their best and
utmost Endeavors to Resist, Repel and Suppress Our Enemies, who come with such
Confidence and great Preparations to Invade and Conquer these Our Kingdoms. And
lastly, We do most expressly and strictly Enjoin and Prohibit all and every Our
Subjects, of what Degree or Condition soever, from giving any manner of Aid,
Assistance, Countenance or Succor, or from having or holding any
Correspondence with these Our Enemies, or any of their Accomplices, upon pain of
High Treason, and being prosecuted and proceeded against with the utmost
Severity.

Given at Our Court at White Hall the 28th day of September, 1688. In the
Fourth Year of Our Reign. GOD SAVE THE KING.
