THE Banqueting House, OR, A Feast of Fat Things: A Divine POEM. Opening many
Sacred Scripture Mysteries. Profitable for all who would attain to the Saving
Knowledge of GOD and of JESUS CHRIST: AND Sufficient to fill the Soul with Joy,
and to Ravish the Hearts of all True Christians.

Written By BENJAMIN KEACH, Author of War with the Devil.

LONDON, Printed by J. A. for H. Barnard at the Bible in the Poultrey, 1692.

TO THE READER.
READER,
IT may not be unnecessary if I acquaint thee with the chief design of my
publishing these Sacred Hymns. I have three sorts of Persons in my Eye to whom
I recommend them.

First, Such who like and approve of Books in Verse which treat of Divine
Things, and would gladly have a little help in order to the understanding of
Metaphorical Scripture; who cannot also well spare so much Money as to purchase
larger Volumes; the Folio I put forth some years ago, called, A Key to open
Scripture Metaphors, being near Twenty Shillings price, comes into but a very
few Peoples hands: Besides, the Impression will soon be gone (as far as I can
gather) and it is not like to be reprinted any more. Now in this small Tract I
can assure you is contained great part of the principal things under diverse
Metaphors opened in that Book, though they are there more largely insisted on.
I do not judge all those Hymns I have taken from Metaphorical or Tropical
Scriptures, are proper to be sung; nor are they here recommended to that end,
some of them being Historical, as part of Hymn 92. page 129, 130. and some
others, containing Matter of Controversy; nor do I think those concerning Hell
so suitable to be sung; yet I doubt not but they may be all of use to the
Reader, all being congruous with God's Word, and according to the analogy of
Faith.

The Second sort are, Parents and Masters of Families, I am persuaded, with the
Blessing of God, this Book may prove of great advantage to their Children, who
generally are taken with Verse, and are much addicted to learn such Songs and
Ballads which generally tend to corrupt Youth; and it is a shame to godly
Christians they should suffer their Children to learn many of them; but since
Singing is God's Ordinance, I mean, to sing Psalms, and Hymns, and Spiritual
Songs, it is doubtless their duty to instruct them therein, as well as to teach
them to read; and by learning Sacred Hymns, they may be taken, before their
Parents are aware, with the Matter therein contained (as diverse have, through
the Blessing of God, as I have been often informed, by reading that small Poem,
called War with the Devil,) and some others. Youth are generally inclined to
Poetry, and as one of the Ancients excellently observes, The Holy Ghost seeing
the Souls of Mankind struggling in the way of Godliness, and being inclined to
the Delights of this Life, has mixed the power of his Doctrine with sweet
Singing, that whilst the Soul was melted with the sweetness of the Verse, the
Divine Word might the better be grafted with profit.

Now these Hymns being short, Children will soon get them by heart, as also
full of varieties, and if instructed to sing, they may be the more affected
with the matter, and receive the greater advantage.

The Third sort are, those godly Christians who know it is their indispensible
duty to sing Psalms and Hymns, etc. not only in their Families, but in the
public Congregation, yet do not think diverse Psalms do so well suit with
Christians under the Gospel, as other Scripture. Hymns do, and diverse worthy
Ministers of the Baptized-way, tho choice Preachers, and fully satisfied in
singing the Praises of God, yet may not have Judgment to compose Hymns, every
Man having his particular Gift of God, and therefore have desired diverse
Scripture-Hymns and select Psalms might be published; and indeed, had I not
been put upon this Work, I am persuaded I had not undertook it, or at the least
not so soon.

Moreover, many Christians had rather have those Hymns we sing in our public
Assemblies printed, that so they might the better know them, and examine the
matter therein contained, to see whether they do agree with the Word of Christ,
and likewise the better sing them with understanding. And it is not unknown what
a multitude of godly Friends have desired to have me write them out several of
those Hymns that have upon diverse occasions been sung in some particular
Congregations. Now to prevent that trouble, and to satisfy them, I promised to
Print the most of those Hymns, and so have done, as they will find them in the
latter part of this Tract. If any desire in such a Book to have no Hymns but
such that are proper to be sung in Congregations, in the next Impression, if
God spare my Life, I shall endeavor to answer their request.

Had I not wrote so lately in Justification of pre-composed Hymns taken out of
God's Word, I should have spoken fully to it here. We are exhorted to sing
Psalms, Hymns, and Spiritual Songs, and since we have none left in Form in the
Scripture, it follows, that those who God has gifted that way, ought to
compose them; for a Hymn or Song cannot be without its Form. Certainly God does
not enjoin a Duty on us, that he has not left sufficient Rule how to come at
it, nor have we any ground to expect the extraordinary Gift any more.

Nor is there, as I have lately shown, any more reason to object against
compiling Sacred Hymns to be sung out of the Word of Christ, than there is to
object against pre-compiled Sermons that are to be preached, though I am
satisfied the Lord does enjoin his Churches to sing the Psalms of David, both
in Ephesians. 5. 19. Col. 3. 16. we reading, of no other Psalms but the Book of
Psalms; so by Hymns and Spiritual Songs I see no reason to doubt but he intends
all Sacred Hymns, etc. taken out of the holy Scripture by the help of God's
Spirit. Mr. Marlow cites a Passage out of Learned Ainsworth, as if he favored
his Notion of Praising God only without Vocal Singing; yet I have lately met
with a Book of that worthy Man on the Psalms of David, where I find him
speaking thus, These Psalms (says he) have ever since by the Church of Israel,
by Christ and his Apostles, and by the Saints in all Ages, been received and
honored as the Oracles of God, cited for Confirmation of true Religion, and
sung in the publsck Assemblies (as in God's Temple) where they sung Praises
unto the Lord with the words of David, etc.

It Is a hard case that any Christian should object against that Duty which
Christ and his Apostles, and the Saints in all Ages in their public Assemblies
were found in the practice of; but it is no easy thing to break People off of a
mistaken Notion, and an old Prejudice taken up against a precious Truth of
Christ. The Lord will, I hope, satisfy all his People about this heavenly
Ordinance in due time, and they shall not call it a Carnal nor a Formal thing
any more, nor cry out, ' It Is as bad as Common Prayer. I must tell them, if
Common Prayer* lay under Sacred Institution in the New Testament, as Singing of
Psalms and Hymns does, I should as freely embrace that: But whereas the one is
Humane, so the other is Divine, that is, ordained and commanded of God, as well
as practiced by Christ and his Disciples, and by the Saints in all Ages.

But not to trouble you any further, if the Lord be pleased to bless the labor
and pains I have taken, give him the Glory, and let your poor Brother have a
part in your Prayers, who is still

Yours to serve you in the Gospel, B. KEACH.

SPIRITUAL MELODY, Containing Near Three Hundred. Sacred Hymns, etc.
PART I.
THE INTRODUCTION.
ALL praise be given to the Lord,
Who condescends so low,
For to unfold deep things to us,
By things which we do know.
Lord give us more Knowledge divine,
Thy Word Explain to us,
That we may find those things of thine
To be indeed precious.
Pour forth thy Spirit on us, Lord,
Deep Mysteries to know,
That we may find Grace in our Souls,
And in it also grow:
And by it may be helped always
Thy Praises to sing forth,
And live also unto thy praise
Whilst we are on the Earth.
PART I. SACRED HYMNS, Setting forth The Glory and excellent Perfections of GOD
the FATHER.
HYMN ^.
Math. 5. 16. Glorify your Father which is in Heaven.
1
A Father does his Child beget,
So we begotten are,
By thy own Word and Spirit Lord,
And do thine Image bear.
2
He likewise does his Children cloth,
And does them also love;
So thou most richly clothes all such
That are born from above.
3
A Father feeds and does protect
Such who his Children be:
So thou do feed and save all those
Who do belong to thee.
4
And also does delight in them
Who him resemble do:
To such who are most like to thee,
Thou do chief favor show.
Second Part.
5
A Father loves his Children should
All live in Unity;
So thou delights to see thy Saints
Walk in sweet Harmony.
6
He ever does o'relook the faults,
Which he in them does spy:
So all thy People's faults likewise
Thou do, O Lord, pass by.
7
It Is a high honor to descend
From such who Noble be;
Kings Children are all but base born,
To those, Lord, born of thee.
8
Rich Parents may soon poor be made,
And also they do die:
Thou Lord art rich, and so wilt be
Unto Eternity.
9
All praise and glory unto God
Our Father, be therefore:
And unto Christ that ransomed us,
Be Praise for evermore.
HYMN 2.
Psalm. 73. 26. God the Portion of his People.
1
A Portion Lord thou did design
On thine for to bestow;
Naught did thou think was good enough
For them of things below.
2
Nor things in Heaven, which excel,
And therefore do impart,
Thy self as the Portion alone
Of all upright in Heart.
3
Who then is able to conceive
How rich thy Children are?
For they have all, since they have thee,
And each an equal share.
4
All have a God, all have a Christ,
Nay, all that thou have too;
Each one has thee entirely,
This does their Riches show.
5
And they, Lord, never shall have less,
Their Portion cannot be spent,
Nor treacherously by wicked ones
From them it cannot be rent.
6
Fire cannot their blessed Portion burn,
Nor Thieves steal it away;
Nor Moths, nor Rust, it cannot corrupt,
O happy, happy they!
The second Part.
7
All things are theirs who have thee Lord,
Tho under age they be:
But yet that day will quickly come
Of their Felicity.
8
When full possession they shall have
Of all that is their own,
And every one of them thou will
With lasting Glory Crown.
9
This Portion, ah, how does it suit!
And answer every want,
And fully does it satisfy
The Soul of every Saint.
10
All Glory and high praise therefore
Let us together sing,
To God the Father, and the Son,
From whence such Riches spring.
HYMN 2.
Psalm. 90. 1. God the Saints dwelling place.
1
THy Saints Lord have a dwelling strong,
And thou that dwelling art,
No habitation like to this,
Has any haughty Heart.
2*
For it is the low and humble Soul
That in the Lord does dwell:
Where such do rest, and have repose,
This dwelling does excel.
3
A house, ah it is our home always,
And when we absent be:
How do we long for to return,
So do our Soul till we
4
Return again unto our God,
When we from thee do stray:
O bring us to our blessed abode,
Christ Jesus is the Way.
5
We here no perfect rest shall find,
Until we fixed are
In our brave house that is above,
No Palace like to it here.
The second Part.
1
A House preserves from heat and cold,
From Winds and cruel storms;
Those who Lord dwell in thee are bold,
Being safe from fear of harms.
2
And in our House our comforts lie,
And all our chiefest treasure:
God is our Joy, our Souls delight,
In whom is sweetest pleasure.
3
Propriety unto a house
Does make it valued;
Our interest in our God, alone,
Makes us lift up our head.
4
In a great House are many Rooms
To dine and also lie,
Rare secret Chambers also we
Do in thee clearly spy.
5
Each Attribute is as a Room
Whither thy Saints do go
By precions Acts of Faith, and then
Nothing they fear below.
6
Another house, tho stately it is,
It may be batte^d down;
But thou art such a House, O Lord,
That cannot be overthrown.
7
Have then away to your abode,
Let all with speed have home,
For dreadful storms you may expect
Will very quickly come.
The Third Part. Chambers of Safety.
1
O come, O come, Gods people all,
With speed have ye away,
Enter your Chambers great and small,
No longer do you stay:
2
For God, the mighty God above,
Is rising out of's place,
And will the Hills and Mountains move,
And Vengeance pour apace.
3
There is a way found out that ye
May be secured,
When Sinners shall consumed be
Who basely are misled.
4
Does it not thunder afar off,
It Lightens also sore:
O tremble all, and do not scoff,
For hark it is more and more.
5
Children get home, and do not stay,
Have to your dwelling place;
For if you make the least delay,
Then sad may be your case.
6
All who abroad or in the Fields
Do foolishly remain,
They may as the Egyptians were,
Be ruined and slain.
Isa. 26. 20. A Storm a coming.
1
O Quake ye who most guilty are,
Who love and live in sin;
For God will suddenly break forth,
As usual has not been.
2
But sing ye Saints, and joyful be,
Christ's Kingdom does draw near,
Do you leave all Iniquity,
And nothing do you fear.
3
The shaking times that are at hand,
Will bring Great Babel down:
And then will God save this our Land,
And Saints with Blessings Crown.
4
Therefore if ye in Christ are found
To every Duty led,
And have your Hearts sincere and sound,
Look up, lift up your head.
5
For your Redemption does draw near,
Gods praises sing therefore:
Unto his call do you adhere,
Then sing for evermore.
HYMN 4.
Joh. 15. 1. God compared to a Husbandman.
1
RIch Husbandmen have House and Land
Both moist and also dry,
God over the Earth has the Command,
And true propriety.
2
The beasts of the field and fowls of the Air,
With Silver, and the Gold
Is all the Lords, yea, and what else
Our Eyes can here behold.
3
He may give it to whom he will,
And then take it away:
He makes men rich, and makes them poor,
And none dare him gainsay.
4
Some ground he plows and sows it then
With choice and precious seeds;
Whilst other ground does barren lie,
Eat up and spoiled with Weeds.
5
And who shall say what do thou,
He may do what he will;
All are thine own, what e're thou do,
Yet thou art righteous still.
The second Part.
1
A Husband (...) (...) very well,
His ground will barren be,
Unless it is well manured,
No profit he can see.
2
Even so unless the fallow ground
Of thy base wicked heart
Be broken up, it will be found
That thou most barren art.
3
A Husbandman does spare no cost,
Nor grudge at his great pains,
That so he may his ground make good,
When he his end obtains.
4
So God likewise thinks naught too much
Who does great cost bestow
On Souls of men, when they prove such
Who forth his Glory show.
5
A Husbandman his Trees does prune,
More fruitful them to make,
But branches that unfruitful be,
Such off the Trees does take.
6
And thus does God by all those men
Who by profession are
In Jesus Christ, who barren prove,
Them long he will not spare.
7
But such that fruitful Branches be,
He purges every one,
And abundantly shall they bring forth,
Before that he has done.
8
As God does sow, so he likewise
Does cause the rain to fall,
That so his Vineyard flourish may,
And's Trees be fruitful all.
9
Which other Husbandmen cannot do,
Nor can they change the soil;
But God can make Men's hearts most good
Which naturally were vile.
10
All praise to him therefore let us give,
And set his glory forth,
And fruitfully unto him live,
Whilst we do live on earth.
HYMN 5.
Heb. 3. 4. God the chief Builder.
1
HE that did build all things is God,
It Is he and he alone*
That made the world, and all things in it,
Praise ye the Holy One.
2
And he laid the Foundation sure
Of the Earth and Heaven too,
Which long have been, and still endure,
Will put them down also.
3
It Is he that built his Glorions Church,
And laid the corner stone,
In all the Earth there is Nonesuch,
O praise the Holy One.
4
With precious Stones he has it built,
Yea, living ones they are,
And by his Spirit so compact,
It Is ^ar beyond compare.
5
The Timber, and the Stones by him
Were squared curiously,
That all the Buildings in the World,
With this cannot come nigh.
6
The matter and the form also,
Did he alone ordain,
No alteration must be made,
Upon eternal pain.
7
All other Builders Servants have
To labor with their hands;
Who according to the pattern act,
And just as he commands.
8
So Ministers God does employ,
Who must the pattern know,
And if they alter any thing,
They do their folly show.
9
The Rule it is Gods Holy Word,
Would you the Pattern view,
It Is the first Church the Lord did build,
As the Apostles Acts do show.
The second Part.
1
Nothing but precious Stones must be
On the foundation placed,
By such who wood or stubble build
This fabric is disgraced.
2
And they will suffer loss thereby
When it comes to be tried,
Because such stuff cannot endure,
Their work will not abide.
3
Then see all ye who are called Saints,
That you are precious Gold,
I mean sincere and godly ones,
Whom God loves to behold.
4
And see that you his building are,
And in you he does dwell,
If in you he has no abode,
Down you must go to Hell.
HYMN 6.
Exodus 15. 3. God a Man of War.
1
GOD is a man of war, and he
Has many ^rmies, who
Almighty are in strength, therefore
Down shall his Foes all go.
2
The Enemies who do engage
Against this Man of war,
^re all infernal powers below,
And such who wicked are.
3
God is a Warrior just and good,
And mighty skill he has,
Before him never any stood
In Hell, much less on Earth.
It Is for his Glory he does take*
The Sword into his hand,
And woe to such who head do make
Against his dread Command.
5
In war he is most terrible,
If he sets in array,
The Battle once against his Foes,
They Will soon melt all away.
6
He Will make the earth to tremble when
He does gird on his Sword,
And cause all proud and haughty men
To fall at his own word.
6
If he the Trumpet once does sound,
And like a Lion roar,
The wicked he will all confound,
And Vengeance on them pour.
8
An Armory and Weapons too
Of Indignation has,
With Fire and Smoke, and Hail also,
He soon can spoil the Earth.
9
If man provoke him to arise,
And stir up Jealousy,
He like a travailling Woman will
Break forth, and loudly cry.
10
A Banner he has to display,
A white Flag he puts out,
To see if Sinners will submit,
Whose Courage seems so stout.
11
If they will not lay down their Arms,
And with him make their peace,
Then let them tremble, they shall see
Incensed wrath increase.
12
And out his bloody Flag will go,
No quarter will he give,
But down they fall both great and small,
And Vengeance shall receive.
The second Part.
1
Woe, woe to all ungodly ones,
Who are his bitter Foes;
But happy are all Friends of his,
And such who with him close.
2
Fear not, ye Saints, this Man of war
Is always on your side,
And in your quarrel he will appear,
And equally divide
3
To every man his own just Right,
And Sion's Cause he will plead,
And will destroy the cursed Whore
That long has flourished.
4
Put hark again, for you must know,
God's patience near is gone,
A warning piece he has let off,
The Battle is begun.
5
O sing, ye Saints, God is come forth,
An alarm he does sound,
The Trumpets blow, and it is heard
In every quarter round.
6
The Beast and cursed Babylon,
Amazed are to hear
What God in England ^^te has done,
But stranger things draw near.
7
God forth is coming with a shout,
Sing praises, sing praises,
He will all his Enemies rout,
And g^^d men's hope it raises.
HYMN 7.
God a strong Tower.
1
THou art, O Lord, a Tower strong,
And Refuge for the Poor,
And that we might all hide in thee,
Have opened a door.
2
Christ is the Door that does let us
Into this Tower, where
We may be safe, and we all know
No other Door is there.
3
Our defense is in the Lord,
The high and lofty one,
And in thee we most safe shall be,
Till all the trouble's gone.
4
Thou art our Shield and Hiding place,
To thee we haste away,
Foreseeing Dangers very ^igh,
Dare now no longer slay.
5
In thee is safety if we fly,
Our Tower is so strong,
We fear no Siege, no Mines can hurt,
Nor do our Tower wrong.
6
Nor can we starve whilst here we ly,
Thy Stores cannot be spent, (...)
In thee is Bread, and all supply,
No ways can Foes invent
7
To take our Fort, we fear no Bombs
Nor Cannon though they roar,
But from our Tower the cruel Foes
To pieces shall be tore.
The second Part.
1*
We in this Tower vent^^e may
All that to us is dear,
(...) can exceed our precious Souls,
Let them be lodged there.
2
Strong Parties garrison within,
Who often make ^allies out;
And one of them can in a night
A mighty Army rout.
3
An hundred eighty thousand men,
Did one of these destroy,
Of cursed Foes who did strive then,
Gods Israel to annoy.
4
A Tower strong is compassed round
With a thick mighty wall,
For to keep off such Foes who do
Pell mell upon it fall.
5
For Bull warks God Salvation has
Appointed for the Poor,
And he a wall of fire is round
About us evermore.
6
Can such who in this Tower are,
Be any time afraid,
All such who know the strength of it,
Can never be dismayed.
7
Take up your Lodging then within,
Haste quickly, don't delay,
Cast off base Habits, leave your Sin,
Christ Jesus is the way.
8
Those who would enter into it,
And not by the right Door,
Will see themselves without the walls,
Before this day* is over.
HYMN 8.
Job 16. 14. He runs upon me like a Giant.
1
A Giant is a man of strength,
Both fierce and swift also,
When like a Giant God appears,
He is provoked we know,
2
By our great sins which grievous are*
In his most blessed sight,
On us therefore as Giants do,
Does he break forth with might.
3
As if he would to pieces tear
Such, whom his Soul does love,
Yet in his Heart affections dear,
Toward us then does move.
4
It Is to convince our Souls of sin,
And us to humble too,
And fit us for some glorious work
He has for us to do.
5
And crucify us to the world,
And to each earthly thing,
^^at we might see from him alone,
Our chiefest Joy does spring.
6
To exercise our Graces too,
This is another end,
that they might their great Luster show,
For this does trials send.
7
And Satan might be silenced,
Who does Gods Jobs accuse,
^^om hence, as you have heard and read,
God thus his Saints does use.
8
And that Examples God might have
Of patience, to sustain
^^me others of his Children, who
May meet with such like pain.
9
Then do not mourn, ye godly ones,
When on you God does run,
^e pities you, and hears your moans,
In mercy will return
10
Again to you, and you shall see
His sweet and lovely face;
Therefore sing ye his praises forth,
And prize his glorious Grace.
HYMN 9.
Romans 9. 21. Has not the Potter power over the Clay*
1
A Potter does prepare his Clay,
Then does the Vessel make,
So thou prepares thy work, O Lord,
Which thou do undertake.
2
The Earth thou did, O Lord, form fi^
Of which we formed were,
Thou did project also before,
What Image we should bear.
3
A Potter diverse Vessels makes,
Which of different sizes are,
Some of one* form; and others do
Another fashion bare.
4
So thou have different Vessels too,
Some noble and some base,
Some curiously are wrought within,
Adorned with thy Grace.
5
Some for Honor, and some likewise
They for dishonor be,
But who shall to the Potter say,
Why is this done by thee?
6
May thou not like the Potter do
What seems good in thy sight?
Thou may give Grace, or it deny,
Yet all thou do is right.
7
O let us then such Vessels be,
Most lovely to behold,
And gloriously to shine within,
Being covered over with Gold.
8
That we thy praises may set forth,
As being all new made:
Once we were marred, but never more
Let our rare Beauty fade.
9
And we will sing to thee, O Lord,
And raise thy name on high,
For we shall glorious Vessels be
To all eternity.
HYMN 10.
Hos. 5. 14. God compared to a Lion.
1
I Will like to a Lion be,
I Will tear and will devour,
Thus do thou say* O holy One,
To show thy wrathful power
2
Against the wicked, who provoke
Thee grievously each day,
When patience does to fury turn,
Thou Wilt sweep them all away.
3
Who can the prey deliver from
A hungry Lion? so
Who is it can save or rescue such
Thou say thou willt o're*throw?
4
A Lion when enraged is fierce,
And all before him fly,
So at thy frowns and dreadful wrath,
How will the wicked cry!
5
When once the Lion's heard to roar,
The Beasts of the Forest quake,
So when thou do in wrath arise,
Sad tremblings thou will make.
6
But if before a Lion one
Himself does prostrate lie
The Lion will not touch his Life,
But leave him, and pass by.
7
So thou, O Lord, wilt such forgive,
Who do themselves submit,
And by Repentance humbly
Lie prostrate at thy feet.
8
The Lion does sometimes couch down,
As if asleep he lay,
But soon does rise with wrathful frowns,
As greedy of his prey.
9
And thus, O Lord, thou seem to sleep,
And wicked men don't fear,
But as a Lion wilt rouse up,
And them to pieces tear.
^0
Then happy you for whom Christ made
With God a lasting peace,
*It Is you may sing, for still you will find
Your Comforts shall increase.
HYMN 11.
Hos. 5. 12. I will be a Moth to Ephraim.
1
MOths secretly do seize and eat,
And spoil fair Garments quite;
So many times thy Judgments are
Hid from most peoples sight.
2
Moths often spoil things rich and rare,
As well as of small worth,
So thou, O Lord, wilt neither spare
The poor nor rich of the earth:
3
All are alike, O Lord, to thee,
If wrath on them do seize,
Unsensibly thou can them spoil
Like Moths, if thou do please.
4
A Moth does eat things by degrees,
A little now and then;
^o gradually thou do destroy
Sometimes vile wicked men.
5
Thou like a Moth, art sometimes, Lord,
In Councels Princes trust,
Who Plots of Enemies cannot see
Till out they fiercely burst.
6
And likewise in Estates of men
Thou as a Moth does come,
Their hopes are great, and much earn they*
But bring but little home.
7
Thou do it blast, and it consumes,
Because they don't it nse
To righteous ends, but basely it
To their own Lusts abuse.
8
Strength thus oft-times does wast away*
In Soul and Body too,
And Treasures of Nations decay,
Tho few that mind it do.
9
Take heed ye Saints of private sins,
Lest God does secretly
Bring Judgments on you till he has
Consumed you utterly.
HYMN 12.
Isa. 42. 14. Now will I cry like a travailing woman.
1
LIke as a Woman travailing
Does cry out in her pain,
So thou do say Lord thou will do,
To pour forth wrath amain.
2
Thy Patience and sweet Lenity
Is almost gone, no doubt,
And therefore thou most bitterly
Wilt quickly now cry out.
3
A Woman when her travel comes
From crying cannot refrain,
So thou will cry for Sions sake
Like her in grievous pain.
4
A woman in her travel strives
Her Child for to bring forth,
So thou deliverance for thy Church
Wilt work throughout the Earth.
5
Afflicted thou do seem to be
For thy poor Sions sake,
And therefore on her Enemies
Dread Vengeance thou will take.
6
When pa^gs do on a Woman seize,
Deliverance is near.
So of thy Foes thou* soon wilt ease
Thy self it does appear.
7
Behold, ye Saints, Gods Love to you,
And sing his glorious praise,
Your Enemy he will overthrow,
And that in these last days.
HYMN 13.
Heb. 12. 29. For our God is a consuming Fire.
1
A Consuming Fire dismal is,
And terrible to see,
So is that wrath of thine, O Lord,
If kindled once it be.
2
Before thy indignation fierce,
What mortal Soul can stand?
Thy wrath is poured out like Fire,
Which none can countermand.
3
The Mountains are thrown down by thee*
Thy wrath does fiercely burn,
And all before thee, thou Lord wilt
To Ashes quickly turn.
4
Fire breaks forth sometimes we do see,
When men are not aware,
So shall thy wrath surprise the Earth
When men secure are.
5
Like to the writing with the hand
On proud Belshazzar's wall,
So when thou do give the Command,
Sinners shall tremble all.
6
Fire breaks forth often times in the night,
When men are fast asleep,
Which does poor people strangely fright,
And sorrows on them heap.
7
So in the night of ignorance,
Whilst Men lie on their beds,
They hear the cry of Fire, Fire,
Just burning o*re their heads.
The Second Part.
1
A fire also consumes amain,
It famous Cities spoil;
So thou will desolations make
Of Sinners who are vile.
2
Can stubble stand before fierce flames,
And not consumed be?
Then may proud wicked Ones likewise
Secure themselves from thee.
3
None can abide thy dreadful wrath,
There is no way to fly;
For thou will them destroy, O God,
As stubble fully dry.
4
Some fires may be quenched quite,
But thine will always burn;
Thy wrath, O Lord, eternal is,
It never will be gone.
5
Fire torments most cruelly
Such who into it are cast;
So will thy wrath all Enemies,
Which they shall feel at last.
6
Tremble, you vile and wicked Ones,
Consider what you do;
On you this fire soon shall seize,
And burn for ever too.
7
But all ye Saints rejoice and sing,
God is to you, ye see,
A fire to warm, and to give light,
By which you quickn'd be.
8
Ah! happy such behold therefore
The difference between
A wicked and a godly Man,
And praise the Lord again.
HYMN 14.
Deuteronomy. 33. 27. Underneath are the everlasting Arms.
1
THou art our Arm of Help, O God
Shall we thy mercy see?
An Arm stretched out of the thick Cloud,
To strenghen such as we.
2
How useful is an Arm to us,
The body to defend?
So is thy love and power, Lord,
On which we do depend.
3
The Arm bears up and does support
Such who most feeble be;
Thy weak and seeble Saints also,
Are, Lord, born up by thee.
4
The Arm the Body does protect,
And save it from all harms;
So thou do us defend and save
By thy Almighty Arms.
5
We with our Arms embrace our Friend,
And hug such we do love;
We by th^^e Arms of power and grace
Embra^'d are from above.
6
Thy Arm, O Lord is very strong,
The vilest Soul can save*
Not shortened, but very long,
Thy help let Sinners have.
7
Woe, woe to them, this Arm of thine
In wrath is laid upon;
But happy such who it upholds,
Thrice happy such a one.
8
Remember Saints when you are low,
Whose Arms are under you;
And sing God's praise continually,
Who will Salvation show.
HYMN 15.
Psalm. 8^. 11. The Lord God is a Sun and a Shield..
1
THe Lord he is our Sun and Shield,
Our Buckler and Safeguard;
And hence we stand, and will not yield,
Though Enemies press hard.
2
Like as a Shield the blow keeps off
The Enemy lays on;
So thou keeps off all hurt from us,
And saves us every one.
3
Let Foes strike at us as they please,
On the head, or the heart;
This precious Shield which we do use,
Secureth every part.
4
From Sin, from Satan, and the World,
No Dart we need to fear;
Since thou art such a Shield to us,
O God, and Savior dear.
5
Our Shield, and our great Reward,
To thee all praise be given;
Who wilt thy saving-help afford,
Until we come to Heaven.
HYMN 16.
Psalm. 46. 1. God is our Refuge.
1
O Holy and Eternal One,
Thou art a Refuge sure;
Help us to fly to thee alone,
Whose Mercies do endure.
2
A Refuge strong thou art, O Lord,
Help us to fly to thee:
Shall we take hold of thy blessed Word,
And safe for ever be?
3
O Lord we bless and praise thy Name,
There is a Refuge found;
For us who are pursued hard,
This is a joyful sound.
4
O Souls, then see with speed we pray
To Jesus Christ to fly,
Lest th'Avenger, through delay,
O retake you, and you die.
5
The way is easy to find out,
All stumbling blocks are gone;
O haste with speed, and look about,
Dangers are coming on.
6
God like a Refuge does give ease,
And fortify the Mind;
When horror does on others seize,
Security we find.
7
This Refuge never will us fail,
All others will not do;
God never will leave us so ^rail,
But present help will show.
8
Of every sin let us get clear,
Yea, freedom from each guilt;
To Christ by Faith let us adhere,
To wash away all filth.
The Second Part.
1
O Lord to thee, to thee we sly,
A dismal day's at hand;
But if we leave iniquity,
In safety shall we stand.
2
Under thy Wings with speed we pray
Hide us, Lord, every one;
Then safe shall we be day and night,
Till all the trouble's gone.
3
And we will thy praises sing forth,
And life thy Name on high;
And also triumph on earth,
Whilst others howl and cry.
4
All glory unto God, that we
Have such a hiding place;
Always shall we rejoice in thee,
when we behold thy face.
PART II. SACRED HYMNS To the Praise of Jesus Christ: In which his transcending
Excellencies are set forth.
HYMN 17.
Heb. 12. 24. To Jesus the Mediator of the New Govenant.
1
A Breach most sore there was between
Poor Sinners, Lord, and thee;
Before the Fall naught then was seen
But perfect amity.
2
But Man, by breaking thy just Law,
^s now become thy Foe;
And as thou do him loath and hate,
So he does thee also.
3
The carnal Mind is enmity
Against the holy God;
And (...) us all (Lord) naturally
Like enmity abode.
4
But thou in mercy and great love,
Through wisdom infinite,
Have found a way wrath to remove,
And Sinners to unite
5
Unto thy self in lasting bonds
Of precious grace and peace,
It Is done by Christ, our blessed Lord,
In him thy wrath does cease.
6
He is that Days-man who lays hold
On both, that so he might
Thee reconcile unto our Souls,
And us to thee unite.
7
He brings thee, Lord, down unto us,
And carries us to thee;
And thus is he dear and precious,
Yea, all in all is he.
Second Part.
1
Thy honor in Each Attribute
He sought to glorify;
Yet did his undertakings suit
Our wants all to supply.
2
In every thing to such degree
Due glory thou do gain;
And we relief unto the full
Through him, Lord, do obtain.
3
In him Justice and Mercy meet,
And gloriously do shine;
Both equally in splendor fit,
As both alike divine.
4
As Mediator he was, Lord,
Exactly qualified;
Most wise and just, yet merciful,
That so he might divide
An equal part in a right way
Unto each party, so
God might be just, yet Justify,
And pardon Sinners too.
To God he is a Friend most dear,
Nay, of so near akin,
His express Image he does bear,
Yet we may say again,
To us he is related too,
Our nature he did take;
From hence he knew well what would do,
An equal peace to make.
Third Part.
Lord, thou wast the offended One,
Whom we had grieved sore;
Thou chose Christ to this work alone,
And cancelled the old score.
In him thy Soul well pleased is,
Who did thy wrath appease;
^is he who reconciles us too,
And does our burdens ease.
Such who accept of terms of peace,
As offered they be
^y Jesus Christ, the breach will cease
Between that Soul and thee.
4
But if the terms refused are,
There will be no Appeal
Allowed such at the last day,
They must thy vengeance feel.
5
Come in, ye Sinners, then with speed,
O see to him you fly!
For he to you his hand must lend,
To slay that enmity
6
That Is in your heart's which change he must,
If ever you receive
Those terms which are agreed on,
Our precious Souls to save.
HYMN 18.
Heb. 7. 22. So much was Jesus made Surety of a better Testament.
1
WE once, O Lord, concerned were
In a commerce with thee;
Before we fell, no need was there
Of any Surety.
2
But we run out, and wasted all,
Which was a mighty store;
And, ah! our credit is so gone,
Thou will trust us no more.
3
Unless it is so, a Surety's found,
We must in Prison lie;
And bear thy dreadful wrath, O God,
Unto eternity.
Christ therefore, Lord, thou did find out,
No Friend had we to bring;
All good therefore which we receive,
Does from thy bowels spring.
Ah! he this work did undertake,
And hands for us did strike;
And such a Surety, O Lord,
For us O thou did like.
Who faithful was, and able too,
Even all our debts to pay;
And all our sins thy word does show
Upon him thou did lay.
Unto thy blessed Covenant
Ah! he did put his hand;
And in our stead laid down his life,
As thou gav^st him command.
'T was thou Lord Christ, who in our room
To the Father did engage
To satisfy his justice, and
His wrath for to assuage.
O what great Love and Grace is here
Thou know very well;
Thou must pay all, and our sins bear,
Which would sink us to Hell.
HYMN 19.
The Second Part, set after the Sacrament.
1
BUt thou wast able to sustain
That heavy weight of sin;
And for our Souls did life obtain,
And righteousness bring in.
2
'Twas from the worth and dignity
Which in thy Person lay,
Thou did God's justice satisfy,
And all our debts defray.
3
Thou being God as well as Man,
Thy Merits have such worth,
a compensation full to make,
And liberty bring forth,
4
For us who did in Prison lie,
Being bound with cruel bonds,
Which none could loose assuredly,
But thy own blessed hands.
5
By that one single payment, Lord,
Laid down when thou did die,
Relief to us thou do afford,
Who dead in sin did lie.
6
For as poor Debtors we were all,
So Criminals were too;
And death deserved great and small,
Condemned in law also.
And thou as Surety for us,
Gav'st up thy self to die;
And in our stead, Lord, thou did thus
God's justice satisfy.
The Third Part.
1
And now the Covenant stands sure
In Christ's most blessed hands;
All good for us he did procure,
Which in him firmly stands.
2
And thus he did engage for those
That given to him are;
And therefore all that God has chose
Shall Crowns of Glory wear.
3
What grace and favor now is this,
That Christ the Just should die,
That we unjust and guilty ones
Might live eternally.
4
Let Men take heed how they despise
Such sovereign grace and love,
Cause it is mysterious in their eyes,
And also far above
5
Depraved Reason to conceive,
That such who guilty be,
Should by another's righteousness
From sin and guilt be free.
6
All praise and glory unto God,
And to the Son therefore;
And to the Holy Ghost let us
Sing praise for evermore.
HYMN 20.
Matthew. 25. 6. Christ the Bridegroom of our Souls.
1
THou mighty King, whose glories shine
A secret did disclose
Unto that blessed Son of thine,
Which was for to dispose
2
Of him, in a sweet Marriage state,
And unto him likewise
All things about it did relate,
Who quickly cast his eyes
3
Upon our Souls, for we were those
With whom he fell in love;
And whom for him the Father chose,
Who nothing had to move
4
His dear affections, for alas!
We loathsome were to see;
And were in a most dismal case
Through our iniquity.
5
But yet thy love it was so great,
A Journey did thou take
From Heaven to Earth, that so thou might
A Marriage with us make.
But ah! what did thou suffer first
Before this could be done;
Or we were Cast, Lord, for our Lives,
And Condemned every one.
And thou could never us obtain,
Nor with us marriage make,
Unless to free us from that pain
Did die, Lord, for our sake.
And this thou did most readily,
All praise unto thy Name;
We purchased were with thy dear Blood,
And so thine own became.
The second Part.
The glorious Bridegroom.
O what a choice, Lord, have thou made!
Are fuch vile ones as we
unto thy lovely bosom laid,
And joined unto thee?
Are we espoused to such a Prince,
The King of Heaven and Earth?
Who has over all pre-eminence,
Whose glories thus shine forth.
Angelick Nature did pass by,
And set thy tender heart
On such as we: O let us cry,
Thou lovely, lovely art.
4
Yet ah! how long was it before
Thou could make us to yield?
We were so dark, but now, O Lord,
Thou, thou have won the Field.
5
Let us our selves give up to thee,
As overcome with love;
And comfort us continually
With Cordials from above.
6
Ah! at this door our joys come in,
This is the blessed spring
Of all true good; for having thee,
We have, Lord, every thing.
7
And if Communion we enjoy,
And find thy comfort sweet,
Our Souls shall sing, and raise thy praise,
Whilst we lie at thy feet.
The Third Part.
The praise of the sacred Bridegroom.
1
Praise in the highest, joys betide
These sacred Lovers dear;
The holy Bridegroom and his Bride
Most glorious do appear
2
Let Heaven above be filled with Songs,
Who see how they do shine
On Eath beneath, let all Men's Tongues
Sing forth his praise divine.
If sullen Man refuse to speak,
(Since Heaven and Earth combine,)
^et Rocks and stones their silence break,
And sing his praise divine.
Ah! 'twas this sacred Bridal Knot
To tie thou did design;
O let such love never be forgot,
Such sacred love of thine.
Ye holy Seraphims above,
O haste and come away,
Who do admire Jesus love,
Sing ye his praise each day.
With Saints on Earth your joys divide,
With speed O do ye come;
Earth never produced so fair a Bride,
Nor Heaven a Bridegroom.
Whose Feet are like to burning Brass,
Whose Eyes a flaming Fire;
Who brings mighty things to pass,
Sing to him, him admire.
The fourth Part.
Our hearts the praises must express
Of Juda's glorious Lion;
The sweet and fragrant Flower of Jesus
The blessed King of Zion.
To him that on the Throne does sit,
Oh it is his praise alone
That we will sing: O it is fit
We praise the holy One.
3
Our hearts and tongues should all rejoy^^
(Angels in consort sing)
Aloud with a melodious voice,
Praise ye our glorious King;
4
Whose Head is whiter than the Snow
That Is driven with the Wind;
Whose Visage like a flame does show,
And does all things confined.
5
And yet he unconfined is,
magnify him alone;
What Lover^is there like to this,
Sing praise to the holy One.
6
Let Us raise his Name who has revealed
His sweet eternal love;
Who by his stripes our Souls has healed
Now is enthroned above.
7
Let trumps of praise ascend on high,
Let them be loudly blown;
So that an Echo pierce the sky
Of praise to the Three in One.
The fifth Part.
1
(...) Saints neglect this duty should,
Or to sing be averse;
Sure rugged Rocks and Mountains would
God's Praises soon reher^e.
The twinkling Stars that day and night
Do their long circuits run:
^he Moon too in her monthly flight,
Also the glorious Sun.
All these do through the Universe
God's blessed praise make known;
How can the Saints be then averse,
To sing to the Holy One.
Let every Saint on Earth rejoice,
O therefore let them msang,
Since Christ has made them his sweet choice,
Let them praise their dear King.
Especially all you who be
Filled with joy, raptured in bliss;
Who can say, My Beloved's mine,
And I am also his.
Sing this as the Hundredth Psalm.
HAil glor'ous Prince, the precious Air
Eccho's Praise to the illustrious Pair!
^et no dark Clouds of Night obscure
This blessed Day, but thus endure:
^et Mortals now in Consort sing*
Anthems to the Eternal King:
^or Frost, nor scorching Heat of June,
^e're put thy Singers out of Tune.
Hail glorious Prince, whose matchless love
Brought thee from thy high Throne above
To court thy Spouse in a poor dress,
Yet was thy Glory never the less:
Though thou wast treated with disdain,
Yet Angels waited on thy Train;
Shepherds thy joyful Welcome sing,
And Wise Men do their Oblations bring:
Blessed Espousals our Freedom bought,
A Match that our Redemption wrought.
Hail glorious Spouse, blessed in him
That Crowns thee with Heavens Diadem.
Behold an unparalled story,
A Slave advanced to lasting glory;
A Virgin fettered in her sin,
Once vile, but now glorions within;
From base estate, a Queen of Honor,
And peerless Beauty put upon her:
Since words cannot d^'t (Conceptions weak)
Our Joys in Ecstasies let us speak.
Heb. 1. 3. Who is the express Image of his Person.
1
IN thee the Father shines most clear,
And such who do thee see,
The Father may behold likewise
His Known, O Lord, by thee.
2
Thou do him clearly represent
Unto our very sight,
Whose express Image, Lord, thou art
Most glorious and bright.
Such whom the Father never saw,
To them thou do him show;
All his perfections are in thee,
What further would we know?
4
Thou* do, Lord, represent to us
God, whom we cannot see;
He dwells in light inaccessible,
Which cannot approached be.
5
Thou brings him to our mind and sight,
Whereby we may conceive
Of his eternal glory bright,
And clearer knowledge have
6
Of him, and also him adore
In thee, and by thee too;
But after all we must confess
We little see or know.
7
All praise and glory unto God,
And Christ, in whom does shine
All glories which the Father has,
Most sacred and divine.
HYMN 22.
Mat. 9. 12. They that are whole, need not a Physician, but they that are sick.
THou, Lord, the good Physician art,
Who know very well
All the diseases of our heart,
And also have such skill,
2
That thou do know what it is likewise
Will ease us of our pain;
Nay, perfectly so cure us,
We sick shall not be again.
3
And thou wast authorized too,
The Father licensed thee;
And did appoint thee to this work,
Physician of Souls to be.
4
And thou approved have been ost;
The works which thou did do,
Did witness bear to thy great skill,
Authority also.
5
Thou know our constitution sins,
And from whence they proceed;
The cause of each disease within,
And how we may be freed
6
From the cursed Plague, Contagion great
That reigns in every part;
No member's free, nor faculty,
But rages most in the heart.
7
There, there the cursed venom lies,
But thou can fetch it out;
And make a perfect cure too,
Of this we have no doubt.
The second Part.
1
But it is true, no medicin's found
Which, Lord, can do us good,
So as to make us whole and sound,
But our Physician's Blood;
2
And therefore thou did pour it forth;
Thy precious blood was shed,
That we might it apply by Faith,
And also be cured.
3
For all our hearts, Lord, naturally
So hard and stony are,
Till softened with thy blood, we see
They cannot thy Image bear.
4
Naught will dissolve the Adamant
And flinty heart we know,
But precious blood which from thy wounds
Most plenteously did flow.
5
But such who never sick were made,
Or did their sickness see,
Are never like thy help to have,
Nor cure find of thee.
6
Thou first does make us see our sin,
And then when we do cry,
Thy Oil and Wine thou do put in,
Which heals us presently.
7
But some don't love to feel the pain,
But would slight healed be,
And have their sores but skinned over,
Such Souls are left by thee.
8
For each dead Member off must go,
Right-eyes be pulled out;
Or else the soul and body too
Shall go to Hell no doubt.
The Third Part.
1
Thou all Physicians do excel,
They cannot all Persons cure;
But there is none but thou can heal,
Yea, heal O Lord for ever.
2
They do it likewise for their gain,
But thou do all in love;
And poor wast made for us, O Lord,
Who rich was once above.
3
To make us sound and whole at heart,
And heal our souls for ever,
Thou did with all thy riches part,
And grievous pains endure.
4
The dead to life they cannot raise,
But this, Lord, thou do do;
And had not thou, Lord, qaickned us,
We had been lost we know.
5
They cannot bless Physic they give,
Neither know the success;
But all that Means which does us good,
Lord, thou to us do bless.
The fourth Part.
1
Other Physicians Men send to,
We did not send for thee;
But freely did thou come to us,
That we might healed be.
2
O let us then love thee, O Lord,
And let poor Sinners cry,
And come to thee, thou will them heat,
And cure presently.
3
But let them not the time delay,
Neither false Medicines use,
Which may perhaps through a mistake
Seem to afford some ease.
4
And since, Lord, thou have healed our souls,
And cured have each sore,
Let Us sing thy praise, with all in us
Praise thee sor evermore.
HYMN 23.
Heb. 9. 16. For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the
death of the Testator.
1
LOrd Christ, thou the Testator art
Of the New Testament;
And had much Goods to give away,
Thou to this end was sent:
2
And full of thoughts thou wast also
How of them to dispose;
But some there were which thou did know
Thy Father long had chose
3
To be the only Legatees
Who unto thee were dear;
And unto them thou did bequeath
All things that thou had here
4
Below on Earth, and all above;
They Heirs are made indeed
Of all the Riches of both Worlds,
What more, Lord, can we need?
5
All things were given unto thee,
Thou art thy Fathers Heir;
And we with thee Joint - Heirs are too,
So much beloved are.
6
The time drew near that thou must die,
And die thou did likewise;
But first did make thy Will, O Lord,
Which in thy Gospel lies.
7
And that is thy last testament,
For thou will make no more;
And by thy blood confirmed it is,
And that, Lord, over and over.
8
And for a Sign the Sacraments
Thou did likewise ordain,
That we might see thy true intent,
And never doubt again.
The second Part.
1
The former Will did disannull;
For it was weak we see,
Since nothing perfect it could make,
'Twas took away by thee.
2
Thou the Testator being dead,
(Yet did revive again,)
Thy Will must not be altered,
Upon eternal pain.
3
Each Precept as by thee it is left,
With care we must observe;
And from thy will and testament
We Lord, must, never swerve.
4
If Angels should this thing attempt,
They cursed then must be;
Let Men then tremble who have done
This great iniquity.
Nothing must added be thereto,
Nor nothing from it took;
Then woe to such; What will they do,
Who have thy Word forsook?
6
And thy last Will and Testament
Gives right and title too
Unto thy Saints of all grace here,
And glory, Lord, also.
7
Like a Testator, thou have named
The Persons who shall have
The great Possession that is above,
Or who it is thou will save.
8
They are all such whom God did give,
Dear Savior unto thee;
Who shall in time on thee believe,
Yea, and new creatures be.
9
O then let us see if we are such,
And sweetly let us sing;
For who is able to conceive
What comfort hence does spring.
HYMN 24.
Cant. 2. 9. My Beloved is like a Roe, or young Heart.
1
LIke as a Heart has a quick sight,
So thou art quick to see;
All wants that do attend thy Saints,
Lie open unto thee.
2
Their dangers too thou do perceive
All things before thee lie;
And help from thee we all shall have,
And that most speedily.
3
And like a Heart art quick to hear,
Although we do but groan;
The smallest sigh comes up to thee,
It pierces does thy Throne.
4
Thou loving art unto thy Spouse,
Thou do exceed the Hind;
Most dearly do thou tender her,
And bear her in thy mind.
5
And as a Heart is swift to run,
And can the Mountains climb;
So thou art swift to help thy Saints,
And all wilt in good time.
6
No opposition Men can make,
Or greatest difficulty
Can thee obstruct; for they relief
Shall have most speedily.
7
Let Us therefore sing, and also say,
Be thou like a young Heart;
O haste, dear Savior, come away,
Thy blessing to impart.
HYMN 25.
Joh. 10. 9. I am the Door.
1
A Way is found to happiness,
Heaven is a lovely place;
Thou art the Door, O Lord, alone
Through thee we see God's face.
2
All good lies hid in God above,
Like to a House of store;
And such who would go in and eat,
Must enter by this Door.
3
All true Men enter the right way,
They at the door go in;
No Pardon, Peace, but it is by thee,
Nor cleansing from our sin.
4
We in thy Church ought all to dwell,
Bring in more souls and more
By thy Example, Doctrine too,
Thou art the only Door.
5
All praise and glory unto God
Let us now sing again;
For showing to us the right Door,
And bringing of us in.
HYMN 26.
Isa. 41. 1. Behold my Servant, etc.
1
LOrd Christ, thou like a Servant wast,
Whilst thou did here remain;
Such hard work was allotted thee,
As put thee to great pain.
2
'Twas hard work to redeem thy Church,
Thou sweat'st great drops of Blood;
Never did any Man sweat such,
'Twas only for our good.
3
Hard work it was to war and fight
Against those cruel foes,
Which sought our ruin day and night,
But thou layest on such blows,
4
That all infernal spirits yield,
Sin, World and Death also
Thou have overcome, and won the field,
This does thy power show.
5
'Twas hard to die, that was thy work,
And more must yet be done;
Thy Temple build, and Vineyard plant,
Fell to thy lot alone.
6
Servants are of inferior rank,
Thou did thy self deny,
And did not reputation seek,
'Twas great humility
Which thou was pleased then to show;
Thy Fathers honor sought,
And unto him great honor too
Thou by thy work have brought.
The second Part.
1
'Twas not to do thy will alone,
But his who did thee send;
In every thing, O holy One,
Thou did condescend:
2
Thou have to wages a just right,
As other Servants have;
Hence crowned art with glory bright,
And more than that do crave,
3
The souls of all thine own Elect
Thy wages are also;
With grace they must be all bedeck't,
And crowned they shall be too.
4
The Heathen's thine Inheritance,
Possession thou must have
Of all the Earth, in God's good time
The same thou shall receive.
5
Because thou did thy soul pour forth,
God to thee will divide
A portion with the Kings of the Earth,
To bring down all their pride.
6
They at thy feet their Crowns shall-lay,
And to thee bend their knees;
The Scepter thou alone shall sway,
And chop down all high Trees.
7
And though a Servant, yet a Son,
And faithful was and true;
And nothing thou have left undone,
Which to thee he did show.
8
But all things plainly did declare,
Even all thy Father's will,
Which in thy word's left very clear,
That we it might fulfill.
The Third Part.
1
O let us now learn of thee, Lord,
And be of the fame mind;
And humble Servants all become,
Then shall we comfort find:
And of thy service never be
Ashamed; for if we are,
Thy face with comfort shall not see,
But wrathful frowns must bear.
3
Thou in thy Father's House, O Lord,
For ever do abide;
We from thy lips must take God's Law,
The glory not divide
4
Betwixt thy self and Moses, who
Is turned out of door;
Ah! him we must not hearken to,
But to thee evermore.
5
This let us do with greatest care,
Since thou so faithful art;
And everything have left so clear
To every thinking heart.
6
Thy praises therefore we will sing,
And set thy glory forth,
Who though a Servant, yet art King,
Yea, King of Heaven and Earth.
HYMN 27.
Rev. 7. 14. He is King of Kings, etc.
THou art a King in Dignity,
And of most noble birth,
Descended from the Lord most high,
The God of Heaven and Earth.
2
And thou also proclaimed art
By Men and Angels too,
To be the only Potentate
Before whom all must bow.
3
God's Spirit did thee King anoint,
To reign for evermore;
And to this office thee appoint,
When out God did it pour
4
Abundantly, to such degree
That none before thee had;
And like a King with Sovereignty,
Lord Jesus thou art clad.
5
All power unto thee is given
As Mediator, so
That all on Earth and Heaven must
Yield all obedience to.
6
Thou have thy Laws, and it is by them
We must be ruled always;
And such who will not own thee King,
Thou will destroy one day.
7
Adore, and see ye reverence him,
All ye who live on Earth;
Obey his Laws, Saints sing his Praise,
And set his Glory forth.
The second Part.
1
He Is King of Saints and Nations too,
He in our hearts must reign;
And sway the Scepter there alone,
All Rebels must be slain.
2
The tyrant sin you must give up
To his victorious sword;
Least countenance to any lust,
None of us must afford.
3
But he a larger Kingdom has;
For he shall soon possess
All Kingdoms which are through the Earth,
With peace he will them bless.
4
This power to himself he will take
In spite of Earth and Hell;
And haughty Monarchs he will shake,
And tyranny expel.
5
Thou, like a King, do honor give,
Yea, titles which are high;
For every Subject's made by thee
A Prince in dignity.
6
A Kingdom too thou have in store
For every one of them;
And they shall reign for evermore,
Over such who did contemn
7
These faithful Servants who to thee
Sincerely did adhere;
And they, when thou O Lord do come,
Shall Crowns of Glory wear.
8
Sing praises therefore, O ye Saints,
Sing praise unto our King;
And make the ^ame of Jesus Christ
Throughout the Earth to ring.
HYMN 28.
Rev. 5. 5. The Lion of the Tribe of Juda has prevailed, etc.
1
LOrd Jesus thou art like a Lamb,
Most meek and innocent;
Yet like a Lion art also
To such who don't repent
2
Until the time thou do awake,
And rise up to the prey;
Then vengeance on them thou will take,
And them in wrath wilt slay.
3
Thy Majesty is full of dread,
And with thy awful frown,
As Lions do, so will thou roar,
And tear great Babel down.
4
A Lion is the King of Beasts,
And also very strong;
That thou art King of all the Earth,
They all shall know ere long.
5
Thou like a Lion wilt revenge
The injury done to thine;
And righteously retaliate
On such who did design
6
The ruin of thy chosen ones,
Whom they have sadly spoiled;
For thou have heard their bitter groans,
Whilst Foes have them reviled.
7
Therefore ye Sinners now submit,
That you may favor find;
And throw your selves at Jesus feet,
To mercy he is inclined.
8
If you before this Lion do
Your selves now prostrate lie;
Your great humility do show,
You Will find his clemency.
The Second Part.
1
When the Lion roars all Beasts do quake
Which in the Forest be;
When out of Sion Christ does roar,
All tremble will you will see.
2
What will become of Murderers,
Who have destroyed the earth,
When inquisition's made for blood,
And thy wrath breaks forth?
3
Ye Saints of his, by Faith and Prayer
Do you this Lion rouse,
To save poor Sion, and to tear
To pieces all his Foes.
4
And now ye wicked wretches all
Who don't this Lion fear,
But think his Lamb-like nature's such,
No Lion he will appear;
5
You Will find er'e long his clemency
Will into fury turn;
And will not then regard your cry,
Whilst you in Hell do burn.
6
But all ye Saints rejoice and sing,
This Lion's on your side;
It Is for your sakes he will arouze,
And soon the prey divide.
7
And in the mean while he able is
To save you and defend,
And full of bowels is to you,
And so will be to the end.
HYMN 29.
Heb. 7. 26. For such an High Priest be comes us.
1
THou art a Priest, Lord Christ, we know
The Father did thee call;
And consecrated thee likewise,
'Twas he did thee install.
2
Into this place and office great
Thy self to glorify,
our High Priest thou did not seek,
Lord, 'twas not in thine eye:
But had a lawful call thereto,
By him who had the right
Or to confer Priesthood on thee,
'Twas pleasant in his sight.
God did thee then anoint also
With Ointment all divine;
And Priestly Robes did put on thee,
Which gloriously do shine.
Thy work it was, and thine alone
To offer Sacrifice;
It Was with thy Blood thou did atone
for our iniquities.
They daily Offerings did bring,
But none could wrath appease;
^ut from thy one sweet Offering
God's justice thou do please
To such degree that he does cry,
He Is pacified for ever;
And all that do unto thee fly,
They pardoned are besure.
The Second Part.
It is thy Lips that Knowledge teach;
The Law too we must have
From thy own Mouth, whose words can reach
Our precious Souls to save.
2
Thou of Uncleanness art to judge,
The Plague of Leprosy,
When in the Head it does appear,
Thou know perfectly.
3
When sin in the affection's found.
And cursed enmity
Is in the mind, thou do pronounce
Their plaguei'th' Head to lie.
4
It Is thou, Lord Christ, whose work it
Thy people all to bless;
Which thou do do by turning them
From sin and wickedness.
5
Thou blesses them with grace and peace
These blessings are indeed;
Those who are blessed, Lord by thee,
From Death and Hell are freed.
6
Thou, as the High Priest did of old,
Entered the Holy place;
So thou did enter Heaven it self,
Filled full of precious grace.
7
And 'twas by blood thou did go in,
That Blood of thine most dear;
And have atonement made for sin,
And therefore do appear
8
Before the Throne of God most high,
Having redemption gained,
Which last will to eternity,
Such blessing have obtained.
The Third Part.
The Prayers of Saints like a Perfume
Come up to God above;
being offered, Lord, by thee,
Whose Incense he does love.
They offered the Bodies of Beasts,
Which could not satisfy
God's justice, neither could that Blood
Our Conscience purify.
And therefore thou (and once for all)
Did offer up thy Blood;
and by that one Offering have thou
Procured our lasting good.
No Priest have thou for to succeed,
No Offering more for Sin;
^r if we needed any else,
Thine had not perfect bin.
Let Romish Errors then be loathed,
Of a Successor vain;
^et Antichrist with shame be clothed,
Who would Christ's glory stain.
Now let us bring true contrite hearts,
That is a Sacrifice
That God through Jesus Christ does love,
And very highly prize:
7
And unto him let us offer up
Both Prayer and Praise each day;
And on the Merits of his Blood
Our selves for ever stay.
8
And also to our High Priest sing
With grace in all our hearts;
Whose precious Blood is that one Spring
Of all good he imparts.
HYMN 30.
Joh. 10. 11. I am the good Shepherd.
1
THou art a Shepherd, and thy Sheep
Are all most dearly bought;
Most safely thou will them all keep,
The lost ones shall be sought.
2
Into green Pastures we are led,
Most blessed Lord, by thee;
And there are we most choicely fed,
Well watered also be.
3
Thy Sheep to purchase thou did die,
What Shepherd was so good?
None never loved his Sheep so,
To buy them with his Blood.
4
A Fold, and a sweet resting place
Thou do also provide,
To shadow us from scorching heat,
And to refresh our mind.
Thy voice let us hear, and follow thee,
A Stranger's voice let us know;
^^d them forsake, the right way take,
Where the old Flock did go.
And to our Shepherd we will sing,
When we thy Mark can see
^^ us is set, from thence will spring
Joy to eternity.
HYMN 31.
Joh. 14. 6. I am the way.
HE that would some choice thing attain,
Or to a place would go;
way for him some must explain,
And he the way must know.
We, Lord, would find the way to bliss,
Where does thy Father dwell;
^o Habitation like to his,
His favor does excel.
How shall we take up our abode
In him whom we should love?
^ow shall we find the way to God,
And come to him above?
4
The way was barred up by our sin,
Another's opened;
Thou art the way, by thee must we
For evermore be led.
5
By thy sweet Life, and by thy Death,
And by thy Doctrine too,
Thou art the way, none else on earth
Is there for us to go.
The Second Part.
1
There is no way to God most high,
But only Lord by thee;
No other Name whereby we saved,
O Lord, can ever be.
2
As thou the Mediator art,
And did atone for sin;
And thy own merits do impart,
The way in thee is seen.
3
As thou a Priest for us did die,
A King over us to reign;
And as a Prophet us to teach,
We see the way most plain.
4
The way of pardon and of peace,
And to be justified;
The way to union with our God,
It is by thee who died.
5
If we would have eternal life,
Thou art the way thereto;
It Is not by our own righteousness,
Though some that way do go.
6
No it is by thee, by thee alone,
Thou art the way, O Lord;
It Is by thy merits, on them to rest,
Thy grace do thou afford.
7
And we thy praises will sing forth,
And in the way rejoice;
Nay sing again melodiously
With a most cheerful voice.
The Phird Part.
1
This is the good old way we know,
Who ever saved were,
'Twas in this way they all did go,
None else did God prepare.
2
Yet it is a new and living way,
Prepared 'twas by blood;
O walk in it, don't go astray,
The way is very good.
3
Most safe and easy to the soul
Who does on Christ depend;
And in the way we do each day
Meet with our dearest Friend.
4
Sweet company besides also,
Who do each other love;
For none can in this straight way go,
But those born from above.
5
We in the way find all things cheap,
Our charges all are born;
And other blessings thou do heap,
Rouse up and do not mourn.
6
Ye drooping Souls, you have a Guide
Who never will you leave;
And will defend you on every side,
If unto him you cleave.
7
Besides you are now almost come
Unto your journeys end;
Behold you are in sight of home,
Your pace O therefore mend.
8
Cast off your loads, O come away,
And sing as you do go;
Sing praise to Christ continually,
From whence all blessings flow.
HYMN 32.
1 Cor. 10. 4. And that Rock was Christ.
1
THe Rock of Ages Lord thou art,
On thee we do depend;
Upon this Rock let us be built,
And then let Rains descend:
2
Let Floods rise high, and let Storms beat,
We shall securely stand,
Whilst others Fall, Lord, will be great,
Who build upon the Sand.
3
O in this Rock let us be hid,
And then we will not fear;
Though Seas do swell, and Waves do roar,
And dangers great are near.
4
In this sweet Rock we Honey find,
And living Waters flow;
This Rock likewise does Jewels sweat,
Here Is golden Mines also.
5
This Rock is high, mount up with speed,
You Canaan may espy;
If you by Faith ascend this Rock,
To you it will seem nigh.
6
Here let us dwell, the shadow's good
For such who weary be;
The hungry soul here may have food,
And be from dangers free.
7
Then sing ye praise unto your Rock,
No Rock is like to this;
The Rock of our Salvation great
A Sanctuary is.
8
Do not forsake your Rock be sure,
O sing continually;
Our dewlling place it is secure,
Praise him that dwells on high.
HYMN 33.
Zech. 13. 1. In that day there shall be a Fountain opened, etc.
1
THou art a Fountain, Holy One,
The Head of every Spring;
All fullness is in thee alone,
To thee we therefore sing.
2
A Fountain full of grace and peace,
Nay it does overflow;
Its waters run, and never cease,
The like's not here below.
3
A vent is made, and it does run,
And sends its waters forth;
The streams this way and that way turn
To water the dry earth.
4
All the low places do receive
These waters evermore;
On humble souls who do believe,
Thou do thy blessings pour.
5
Into these Valleys thou do send
Thy precious streams amain;
Those Meadows well are watered,
Yea, watered again.
6
Like as the Sun is full of light,
And Waters fill the Sea;
So art thou full of goodness, Lord,
So is that grace in thee.
7
How many Vessels have thou filled
Since first the Fountain run!
And many thousands more wilt fill
Before that thou have done!
The Second Part.
1
All Souls of Saints that ever were,
Who did true grace possess,
Were filled by thee, and yet we see
There Is never a drop the less.
2
Great Vessels, Lord, thy Churches be,
Yet all these thou do fill;
A gracious measure they all have,
According to thy will.
3
A bigger Vessel we espy
Thou empty wilt anon;
And fill it full of grace likewise
Before that thou have done.
4
This Vessel, Lord, is the whole Earth
That now abounds with sin;
Thou will it empty over awhile,
And fill it full again.
5
Nay, thou will turn it upside down,
As some their Vessels do;
To empty it of wickedness,
Which now abounds so.
6
And then the earth with knowledge shall
As Seas with water swell,
Be filled, Lord, and that by thee,
As Holy Writ does tell.
7
And well it is thou have so much
Water of life in thee;
For all our Vessels empty are,
Besides they leaky be.
8
Nor is there any other Well
Our wants for to supply;
We must unto this Fountain come,
Or else our souls will die.
Third Part.
1
All people that on earth do dwell,
Of^ water stand in need;
But none is there to be found out,
But what, Lord, does proceed
2
From thine own self, and now O well
Unto thee we will sing;
O mighty Sea! and Fountain deep!
And every lasting Spring!
3
With Saints of old we'll sing this Song,
And say, Spring up O Well;
And send thy water forth, and now
Refresh thy Israel.
4
Here we may wash, and healed be,
And cleansed from our sin;
Here we may drink who thirsty are,
And never thirst again.
5
O come unto the Fountain now!
O haste and come with speed!
Behold it is open, come away,
These waters you do need,
6
Before the Fountain is sealed up,
Or God the stream does turn;
O come ye Sinners, wash your souls!
See how the waters run!
HYMN 34.
Col. 1. 18. He is the Head of the Body, the Church.
1
THou holy Son of God most high,
It Is thou who art the Head
Of Angels, whose great dignity
Most famously is spread.
2
Ye glorious Seraphims above,
And Principalities,
Most willingly do Christ adore,
In whom all fullness lies.
3
Thou art the Head of human race,
The Head of every Man;
The Head too of thy Church also,
Thy glory no tongue can
4
Set forth according to thy worth,
Most great in dignity;
And of such high and noble birth,
All Beings do outvie.
5
It Is by thy glorions influence
The body is sustained;
As thou have the pre-eminence,
Thou have all glories gained.
6
Each member is supplied by thee,
And held in sacred bonds;
And nourished are continually,
And under thy commands.
7
The governing part Iyes in the head,
In it our glory lies;
And if the head be once struck off,
The body straitway dies.
Second Part.
1
And since thou live evermore,
From hence also we know
Thy body and each member shall
For ever live also.
2
All praise and glory therefore we
A scribe unto our Head;
All reverence belongs to thee,
By whom we are governed.
3
But one head can the body have,
And if it should have two,
It would a frightful monster be,
All mortal Creatures know.
Now cursed Babel, look thou to it,
And weigh it well therefore;
For since thou have a new Head got,
Thou art an errant Whore.
HYMN 35.
Joh. 1. 36. Behold the Lamb of God.
1
HAil, blessed Lamb, thou Lamb of God,
So harmless and so meek;
Thy glory great O we would raise,
Thy honor always seek.
2
No spot nor blemish was in thee,
But yet, Lord, thou wast sold
For a poor price, who is worth cannot be
Computed nor be told.
3
Sold and delivered up also
Into the Butchers hands;
Who mangled thee inhumanly
Who Heaven and Earth commands,
4
A Sacrifice thou did become,
Thou willing wast to die;
And meekly as a Lamb is dumb,
Thou took'st it patiently.
The Second Part.
1
No Lamb so innocent as thou,
Nor none so lovely are;
And in a bosom thou did lie,
With whom none can compare.
2
The best of all the flock above,
The chief of all below:
Behold him then, and fall in love
Ye would if you did know
3
The worth of him and the great need
You have of precious food:
By Faith you must on this Lamb feed,
And also drink his blood:
4
Or else you shall be sure to die,
His Flesh is meat indeed;
So is his Blood: O will you try?
There Is nothing more you need.
5
Ye who do eat his Flesh shall live,
And never shall ye die;
His Flesh and Blood to you does give,
Take it then thankfully,
6
And sing unto the holy Lamb,
Sing Praises now therefore:
O praise him that he hither came!
Sing Praises evermore.
HYMN 36.
Zech. 3. 8. I will bring forth my Servant, the Branch. Zech. 6. 12. He shall
grow out of his place, and shall build the Temple of the Lord. Zech. 6. 13.
Even he shall build the Temple of the Lord; and he shall bear the glory, and
shall be Priest on the Tbrone, etc.
1
A Root as God, as Man also,
A Branch here called art;
Which does thy humane nature show,
To whom God did impart
2
All fullness of the Deity
It in this Branch appears;
Most precious Fruit we do espy
This Branch for ever bears.
3
The Branch is of the self-same kind
With the Root of the Tree;
The self-same nature we do find
That Abraham's Children be
4
Of, thou did take, that so thereby
We might assurance have,
That every way thou fitted art
Our precious souls to save.
5
A Branch partakes too of the Sap
Which in the Root does lie;
So in the Virgins Womb was fed
Thy blessed Humanity.
6
In The Branch or Branches of the Tree
Its glory does shine forth;
So it is in thee that David's Race
Its greatest glory has.
The Second Part.
1
Let Heretics who do deny
Christ of the Virgin took
His spotless, pure humanity,
Ashamed ever look.
2
And let us all stand in amaze,
Whilst we behold and see
How God our humane nature has
Made one with the Deity.
3
Now let us sing unto the Man
Called the Branch; for he
Shall grow and flourish in such sort
That never did a Tree.
4
For he upon the Throne does sit,
And all the glory bear;
And also shall God's Temple build,
And make its beauty rare.
HYMN 37.
Act. 3. 22. A Prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you.
1
A King, a Priest, and Prophet too,
Thou art, O Lord indeed;
As Mediator art also
We such a one did need.
2
Thou art God's mouth, to people all
God has in these last days
Spoken to us, it is thou do call,
And speak too, many ways.
3
A Prophet speaks not of himself,
But as inspired;
So God gave thee the Commandment,
As we have often read.
4
What thou should speak, and what make known,
From thee he nothing hid;
By thee to us all things are shown
Which God commanded did.
5
The Prophets did thy Kings anoint,
So such likewise receive
From thee the holy Unction do,
Who truly do believe
6
Prophets were to teach Gods good Word
In all uprightness too;
So thou do teach us all, O Lord,
Yea all things we should do.
7
Yea what, and how we should believe,
And how depend on thee;
And how to walk, (who Truth receive,)
That saved we may be.
The Second Part.
1
The Prophets showed things to come,
And so have thou likewise,
Not only in the World that is now,
But when the Dead shall rise.
2
How it shall go with thy Saints here,
Thou did to them make known;
And how in glory they will appear,
When Sinners are overthrown.
3
And he who does not unto thee
In every thing adhere,
And do whatever thou do say,
Thy angry frowns must bear.
4
O hearken to this Prophet then
In whatever he does say;
Fear lest you be all undone Men
In the last dismal day.
5
And ye who be the Saints of God,
Keep to his Word be sure;
Then may you sing, for you shall be
Happy, happy for ever.
HYMN 38.
Romans 14. ult. Put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, make no provision for the
flesh, etc.
1
WE naked once were all, O Lord,
And loathsome were to see;
Our shame was seen, and vile within,
Till clothed were by thee.
2
It Is true, Lord, once in ancient time
We gloriously were clad;
Our beauty was then in its prime,
Not long we so abode,
3
But we were, Lord, beset with Thieves,
Who tore our Robes away;
And in our blood and nakedness
We a long season lay.
4
But thou in mercy did pass by,
And with us fell in love;
Though nothing in us could espy
Affections great to move.
5
Our souls thou did in the first place
Most graciously wash clean;
And then did cloth us with thy grace,
Never braver Robes were seen.
6
These Garments first by thee were bought
They cost thee very dear;
And by thy Spirit they are wrought
Most curiously and rare.
The Second Part.
1
No Needle Work was e're so fine
Bespangled with Gold,
As is ihe Robe of Righteousness
To all who it behold.
2
Thus is thy grace compared, Lord,
With which thou do adorn
The Souls of thy most blessed Saints,
Whose Garments once were torn,
3
And nothing had to cover them,
But filthy Rags so vile,
That thou our Image did contemn,
Since we thy own did spoil.
4
Thus by our Garments we are known,
And those who han't them on,
Thou will, O Lord, never such own,
But bid them to be gone.
5
It Is thou have made the difference,
We were ill clothed as others,
But these have not the preference,
None like our Elder Brother's:
Ay, that is rich, O Lord, indeed,
Without least spot or stain;
It Is that keeps off all fiery darts,
And clean it will remain.
6
But these much comfort to us bring,
And keep us also warm;
We need not fear no pricking thing,
Cold cannot do us much harm.
The Third Part.
1
They ever do their fashion hold
Most beautiful and fair;
They make all look young when they are old,
Such to thee lovely are.
3
The longer we these Garments wear,
The better they would be;
For the long use of godliness
Makes us shine splendentlie.
3
Our Garments then let us not defile,
But have them always on;
For we must wear them every day,
Until our lives are done.
4
And then shall we, Lord, clothed be
With immortality;
In Robes that shine like to the Sun,
Unto eternity.
5
Come Sinners then, ah! will you buy
Some Clothes to cover you?
Most rich they are assuredly,
Come, let your own Rags go.
6
What is Morality to Grace?
Even like a filthy thing:
Get those Robes on, and take your place
Amongst Children of the King.
7
Ye Saints don't you provision make
To satisfy your lust;
But put on Christ, your Garments take,
Because you ready must
8
Be all, the Bridegroom to attend;
He comes, he comes, sing praise;
Your Lamps now trim, he will descend,
Make haste without delays.
HYMN 38.
Joh. 2. 2. We have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.
1
O Lord we have a mighty Cause,
And still it does depend!
Ah! we have broke all God's just Laws,
VVilt thou our Souls befriend,
2
To take in hand our Cause to plead?
Thou art our Advocate;
Ve dare not, Lord, lift up our head,
Our Case for to relate.
But thou allied art to the Judge,
And for our Souls did die;
The Merits of thy Blood may urge,
To thee we all do fly.
Thou legally art called to the Bar,
And have thy Father's Ear;
Alas we all so loathsome be,
We dare not there appear
5
In our own persons; he is just,
And we must guilty be;
We righteousness all therefore must
Have only, Lord, of thee.
6
Thou never did miscarry yet
On what thou took'st in hand;
Our Enemies do thou defeat,
That sentence do demand.
7
Have thou not paid our Debts, O Lord?
Read our Discharge we pray,
And that will comfort now afford,
And this most doubtful day;
8
Is not all paid? Can Justice see
Just ground for to deny
Our true Acquittance, Lord, in thee
Who did him satisfy?
The second Part.
1
Our Cause, Lord, thou did undertake
Without the hopes of fee;
And this does us most cheerful make,
We hope we now shall see
2
An end put to that bitter strife
Which has been long between
Our God and us; alas, our life
In jeopardy has been.
3
O blessed Lord, we do perceive
Our Cause it does go well;
For he who does on thee believe,
Shall never go to Hell:
4
But he shall live eternally
In joy and happy bliss;
Our Advocate has won the day,
What love is like to this!
5
Thou in our stead was pleased to die,
Who Criminals all were,
The Law for us did satisfy,
No errors can appear:
6
No superseding of our suit,
Our Foes cannot it remove;
For thou as Judge in chief shall fit
In the high Court above.
The Third Part.
There Is no Appeal from that high Throne,
Our Cause being carried there;
If Conscience should bring Charges on,
Yet there we all stand clear.
2
For though sin does in us abide,
It in us shall not reign;
And we have Jesus on our side,
Who will wash us again.
3
But hear us once ogain; O Lord,
Shall we our pardon see,
And know that we are justified,
And peace have all with thee?
4
How sweetly then, Lord, shall we sing,
No cause have we to doubt;
Therefore we'll leave our Cause with thee,
And sing thy Praises out.
5
But O ye Saints take heed of sin;
But if that sin you do;
An Advocate with God there is,
Who pleads always for you.
6
And now poor Sinners will you fly
To him with care and speed?
This Advocate for you does plead,
Who for your Souls did bleed.
7
THough you no money have at all
To carry on the Suit;
Yet he will be your Advocate,
If to him you submit.
HYMN 39.
Joh. 6. 50. I am the Bread of Life.
1
THou art the Bread of Life, O Lord,
Bread is a blessed thing;
Some Bread to us do thou afford,
Shall we lie here starving,
2
When in our Father's House there is store,
And we have naught to eat?
Remember us, think on the poor,
A little broken Meat!
3
Ah! some small Crumbs, Lord, let us have,
Which from thy Table fall;
A bit of Bread we humbly crave,
Or we shall perish all.
4
Bread is the stay and staff of life,
It Is Bread will do us good;
Fill us, O Lord, with holy strife,
Till we attain this food.
5
Bread is ordained to an high end,
The life of Man to save;
^om Heaven, Lord, thou did descend,
That our poor souls might st have.
That blessing's great; ah! life is sweet,
Lord, we must eat or die;
and therefore beg now at thy feet,
Some Bread do not deny.
The second Part.
1
Bread pleasant is unto the taste,
To souls who hungry be,
This property also thou have,
O it it is found in thee.
2
What can taste sweeter than thy love?
O come poor souls and try;
That Bread which came down from above
Is set before your eye.
3
By Faith you must this Bread behold,
And you by Faith must eat;
Without true Faith you have been told
It is (alas) dry Meat.
4
Bread does renew the strength of Men
Who ready are to saint;
O then on Christ let us feed again,
Eat Bread poor drooping Saint.
5
On Christ rely, don't look within,
On Jesus do depend;
It Is he has made an end of sin,
To him God does thee send.
6
Bread is the best of earthly things,
A morsel is worth Gold;
From Christ all blessings to us spring,
His worth none can unfold.
7
Bread is a portion for the poor,
O let us haste away;
But see you come to the right door,
There may ye feed each day.
8
But what is common Bread to this,
Which soon does putrify?
Oh feed on this, none like it is,
Eat and ye shall not die.
9
All praise to God, and Christ the Lord,
Who Bread to us do give:
O sing his praise, Saints, all your days,
Eat, and your souls shall live.
HYMN 40.
Mal. 4. 2. The Sun of righteousness shall arise with healing under his wings.
1
THere is a Sun, there is but one
To light the Universe;
Beside thy self, O Lord, there is none
Who can enlighten us.
2
Thou art the Fountain of true Light,
Nay, all light is from thee;
^s thou art God omnipotent,
Clothed in Majesty.
All light of grace which Saints receive
From thee, Lord, does it flow;
^ew Men who in this world do live,
Alas, are lighted so.
What clearer is there than the Sun?
O what can brighte shine?
Thy glory, O most holy One,
Exceds, it is divine.
Most splendant rays do sparkle forth,
Which dazles every eye;
Thy beams are brighter than the Sun
That shines so gloriously.
Thou art the Soul of all the World,
By thee all Creatures live;
All things together would be hurled,
If life thou did not give.
We see the Earth and Heaven too,
Thou do uphold them all;
If thou should once let go thy hold,
Together down they would fall.
The second Part.
Thou like the Sun communicates
Thy glorious influence
Of grace and goodness to thy Saints,
Thou have pre-eminence.
2
What a dark world would this be
Were there no Sun to shine?
What darkness, Lord, ah! should we see,
Had we no beams of thine?
3
It Is thou that do expel away
Dark vapors of the night;
Thick mists and fogs they all do fly
When thou appear'st in sight,
4
Most pow'rfully do thou expel
The darkness that is within;
And makes the soul in light to dwell,
By vanquishing our sin.
5
Thou make a sweet and lovely day
When once thou do arise;
And dries up th'filth that in our way
Did lie before our eyes.
6
It Is thou who makes a lovely spring;
Those things which seemed dead,
When thou draw'st near are flourishing,
And forth their glories spread.
7
Without thy influences, Lord,
Thy Veg'atives cannot grow;
Till thou do life to us afford,
No fruit from us can flow.
8
Let all who on the earth do dwell,
Sing with a cheerful voice;
The praise of Jesus let them tell,
And in this Sun rejoice.
The Third Part.
O Lord, until that thou do shine,
No heat within have we;
All spiritual warmth's from beams of thine,
All true joy is from thee.
2
The Sun does heal as well as warm,
And when thou do arise,
We need not fear no kind of harm
From inward enemies.
3
For thy sweet wings fresh healing brings,
Our hearts to mollify;
And to those Souls who feel Death's sting,
A plaster do apply.
4
According as the matter is
On which the Sun does shine;
So does it always operate,
So do those rays of thine
5
To one whose heart thou have made soft
Thy word a savor is
Of life unto life, but to some
A Savor of death it is.
6
The Sun does ripen things we see
To bring the harvest on;
So we are ripened, Lord, by thee,
And for thee, every one.
7
Thus do thy glories, Lord, appear,
By these things we may know
What rare perfections in thee are,
And from thee also flow.
8
Therefore thy praises we will sing,
Enliv'ned with thy rays;
And will exalt our glorious King
Until we end our days.
HYMN 41.
Rev. 22. 16. I am the Root and Offspring of David.
1
THou art the Root from whence we sprung
Who are thy chosen ones;
Till we were grafted into thee,
We were like to dry bones.
2
The Root of Grace and Nature too
Art thou we do espy;
Not only Man, but God also,
We never will deny
3
The top-stone of thy glory great:
All things by thee were made,
And at thy word at the last day
They all again shall fade.
4
Ah! in this Root what sap is there?
The branches shall be fed;
Come drooping Saints be of good cheer,
Lift up with joy your head:
5
You grafted are in such a Root
Whose virtue's infinite;
Can you want grace, why do you doubt?
Such souls God does unite
6
To Jesus Christ; they all shall have
From him all fit supply;
And unto them, for their support,
He nothing will deny.
7
Christ is our Head, Christ is our Root,
Christ is our Life also;
Christ is your Food, our Sun, our Strength,
What have you now to do
8
But live unto his holy name,
And sing his praises forth?
O raise his glory and his fame
Whilst you do live on earth.
The Second Part.
1
The Root it does the Body bear,
And every Branch therein;
Most safe thy Churches Members are,
And so have ever been:
2
Because by thee they are sustained,
Thy Tree shall never fall;
It cannot be dug up by the root,
Our life is hid from all.
3
Like as the root is hid in the earth,
And life does center there,
Even in the Root; so we by Faith
Lord see how safe we are
4
In thy own self; none can hurt thee,
Nor can they stop the course
Of that sweet Sap that feeds our Tree;
A blessed intercourse
5
There is between those souls of thine
And thy own self, O Lord;
We'll never fear what Foes can do,
If sap thou do afford.
6
Let us in thee well rooted be,
Our Root is very sound;
If we enjoy true unity,
Our Fruit will much abound.
7
Because that thou do always live,
Thy Branches shall also;
Thou unto us thy life do give,
Thy grace does overflow.
8
Ye righteous in the Lord rejoice,
His holiness proclaim;
Be thankful with your hearts and voice,
And sing of his great same.
HYMN 43.
Mal. 3. 1. The Lord whom ye seek, shall suddenly come up into his Temple, even
the Messenger of the Covenant whom ye delight in, etc.
Heavens glorious Ambassador
Is come, is come, be glad,
Who blessed news brings from afar,
How can ye more be sad?
2
He represents the person clear
Of the most mighty King;
And blessed news he does declare,
And tidings with him bring.
3
His Commission great has sealed been,
His journey long has took:
He Is come, he is come we say again,
Him for whom you did look.
4
And terms of peace poor Sinners now
May have, which easy be;
Before the dreadful God then bow,
And leave iniquity.
5
The white Flag of Mercy is out,
The Banner is displayed;
Come Sinners now and look about,
And longer been't afraid.
7
Gods wrath is over in Jesus Christ,
If to him you do fly,
You shall not bear eternal wrath,
O then on him rely.
8
Among the gods, O Lord, is none
With thee to be compared,
Thou peace extends, O holy One,
The like has not been heard.
The second Part.
1
Nay more than this, Christ comes to treat
About a Marriage too:
His love to Sinners, O it is great,
For he makes known to you
2
That glorious, high and blessed design
Of the Great God above,
Which is to take that soul of thine
Into contract of love.
3
Behold the mighty Prince of Peace,
Whose glories does excel;
He looks on you, and loves you so,
That he with you would dwell.
4
O cast your eyes on him with speed,
Come Virgins fall in love,
Don't take another in his stead,
Whose 'ffections in him move
5
Toward such souls as yours, alas,
Though never so vile within;
If once this thing does come to pass,
He Will take away your sin.
6
Then look to him by Faith and Prayer,
O cast a single eye,
And close with him this very day,
He with you will comply.
7
Now let us sing and praise the Lord,
Who did Christ Jesus send,
To proclaim peace, and love afford,
Praise him world without end.
The Third Part.
1
Hark, hark, the Trumpet sounds, look out,
The Ambassador of Heaven
Proclaims a peace, without all doubt
Attendance must be given.
2
Lay down your arms, his terms are good,
O cease this wicked war;
You have too long, alas, withstood
Heav^ns blessed Ambassador.
3
He will not wait on you always,
If you do not comply,
You will e're long see bloody days,
For all of you must die.
4
Whilst you oppose such mercy great,
What wretches are you all;
You summoned are to the Judgment Seat,
O great will be your fall,
5
If quickly now you don't submit,
He Is ready to be gone:
O loath your selves, lie at his seet,
From all your folly turn.
6
The bloody Flag you soon shall see
Put forth in dreadful wrath;
If still his call rejected be,
No place for you on Earth,
7
But you to Hell with vengeance must
Be turned every one;
And from God's presence be accursed,
Ah this now think upon;
8
And say you have a gracious call,
And happy you may be,
If you lay hold on Gospel-terms,
A pardon you shall see.
AYMN 44.
Heb. 1. 2. Whom he has appointed Heir of all things.
1
IN regions of approachless light
There sits the eternal King;
Wherein mixed joys with love unites,
From whom all riches spring.
2
There do thou sit on thy high Throne,
And all subject to thee;
Yea, and all worlds, Lord, are thine own,
And what else there can be.
3
A Son thou have also brought forth
(Who is thy only Heir)
Begotten long before the Earth
Or Heavens did appear.
4
He is thy joy and hearts delight,
By whom all things were made;
He always stands in thy own sight,
Whose glories never shall fade.
5
And as he makes thy heart full glad,
So all perfections meet
In him who is with glory clad,
Whose love is ever sweet.
6
He is thine Heir, into his hand
All things, Lord, thou have given,
That so he might have sole command
Over Earth and also Heaven.
7
He Is clothed with such dignity,
Has such a glorious name,
That he ^s above each Monarchy,
There Is none dares once lay claim
8
To his Titles; each Seraphim
Do readily submit;
The Cherubims do worship him,
And fall down at his feet.
The Second Part.
1
It Is Christ, and only Christ does bear
Thy likeness in each thing;
Thy express Image does appear
In this our glorious King.
2
It Is thou, blessed Jesus, who do raise
Thy Father's House so high;
The stress of all on thee he lays,
Of his whole Family*
3
In thee all treasures hidden are
Of grace and wisdom too;
And all because thou art his Heir,
From thee all riches flow.
4
Thou portions therefore do give sorth
To all given to thee,
Who witness do all the new birth,
And Sons adopted be;
5
And so made Heirs, and shall possess
With thee a glorious share
Of that eternal blessedness
Of which thou art the Heir.
6
All things were thine as thou art God,
But unto thee are given
(As thou the Mediator art)
By the great God of Heaven.
7
O how art thou, Lord, honored,
Who would not fall in love
With thee whose glories thus are spread
Below, also above.
8
O happy choice ye Saints have made,
Who married have the Heir;
Soon ye shall the possession have,
And glorious all appear.
9
Then never doubt of all supply,
Ye precious Saints of his;
He will you no good thing deny,
What happiness like this.
10
O then with a melodious voice
Together do ye sing,
Since he has made of you his choice,
Praise ye the glorious King.
HYMN 45.
Rev. 1. 5. And from Jesus, who is the true Witness.
1
O Holy God, we thee adore,
Who glorious truths makes known;
And that of them we might not doubt,
But steadfastly them own.
2
A glorious Witness thou have sent,
Who from thy bosom came,
And he himself also does say,
I the true Wirness am.
3
But what do thou, O blessed Prince,
Bear witness now unto?
Ah! it is of that eternal love
Which from the Lord does flow.
4
And of that great and good design
Of saving each poor soul,
By Blood and Merits Lord of thine,
Who do upon thee roll;
5
And know in thee all truth is found,
Who the Messia art;
And that grace does in thee abound
To each believing heart.
6
To the true Witness now above
We ought therefore to sing,
And always to admire his love,
From whence all comforts spring.
The Second Part.
1
A Witness faithful, Lord, and true;
He sometimes others brings
As witnesses with him to show
And open diverse things.
2
The holy Prophets we do find,
Who were, O Lord, of old,
Bear witness, and were of one mind,
Thy Record to unfold.
3
And God the Father from on high,
With an amazing voice
Did record bear assuredly,
Whose witness is most choice.
4
The Spirit also bears record
These three agree in one,
And testify to every word
Delivered by the Son.
5
The Miracles which Jesus wrought,
They also witness bear
To whatsoever he made known,
Or did to us declare.
6
Then tremble ye who wicked be,
Escape ye never shall,
If ye believe not Christ is he,
With vengeance you shall fall:
7
And in your sins you all shall die,
This the true Witness said;
But all ye Saints rejoice and sing,
For all your debts are paid.
HYMN 46.
The Third Part
1
A Witness must his witness bear
Unto the Truth; nay he
Must the whole truth like wise declare
In all simplicity.
2
And nothing but the truth must speak,
And speak it plainly too,
A true decision clear to make,
All this, Lord, thou do do.
3
Whatever is a truth of God,
Which we ought to obey,
In thy New Testament it is found,
We all the stress must lay
4
Upon thy faithfulness: O Lord,
Can thou a truth pass by,
'Not witness to it in thy Word,
Or let it darkly lie
5
There in concealed, when it is a thing
Of such a great concern,
That Men do say with greatest care
Each Soul is bound to learn?
6
Or if they don't it strictly keep,
To Judgment they must come:
Nay threaten such who it neglect
With an eternal doom.
7
Ah! let them blush with greatest shame,
We to thy Word appeal,
Who the true VVitness art, and know
Thou did no truth conceal.
The fourth Part.
1
Now when a thing does doubtful lie,
And Men cannot agree;
When what one says, others deny,
We presently should flee
2
To thee the true and faithful One;
If to that very thing
No witness thou have plainly born,
Away we must it fling.
3
Art thou the only VVitness, Lord,
To every Truth divine,
And not one word for such a thing
Out of that mouth of thine?
4
And yet can that a truth be thought,
They other VVitness bring;
They call for Moses, he is brought
To witness to this thing.
5
And thus they, Lord, do thee degrade,
Or do invaluate
The Highest VVitness e're was heard,
Or Matters did relate.
6
Moses was not for evermore
Within the House to be;
He spoke on Earth, but thou from Heaven*
No Lawgiver but thee,
7
Lord, can we own, since all power is
To thee alone given;
And all thy Laws they are firm as
The Ordinance of Heaven.
The Fifth Part.
1
No Tabernacle here is for him,
Appears to every one
Whose eyes are open, if they look
They Will find that he is gone:
2
None, none but Jesus does remain,
What can there be more clear?
God calls to us too out of Heaven,
Him only now to hear.
3
Besides, if Moses should come in,
Their Cause he would give away;
He never gave that Law to them
Who live in the Gospel day:
4
'Twas given unto Israel
When they in Horeb were;
Not to their Fathers, but to them,
Does eminent appear; Deuteronomy. 5. 1, 2, 3

5
To Jews and Jewish Proselites,
Or all within their Gate;
But not to them without their Church
Did that at all relate.
6
The truth, as it is in Jesus, we
Ought only to receive;
And such who do not, we may see
Themselves they do deceive.
The Sixth Part.
1
A Witness ought for to be one
That is indifferent,
Not biased to either side,
Therefore God has thee sent
2
To be a Witness in our Case;
To us thou art of kin;
And equally related art
Likewise too unto him.
3
We therefore have no cause at all
Against thee to except,
But on thy witness stand or fall,
If Cast, we must subject
4
Unto the Judge of Heaven and Earth,
We silent all shall be,
If thou against us do come sorth,
And cast we are by thee.
5
Unto the truth witness to bear
Thou came, Lord, from afar,
And wilt against Sinners appear
When they come to the Bar:
6
At the last day if they are found
In bonds of unbelief,
Or have their hearts false and unsound,
They Will tremble like the Thief:
7
Against the false Professor thou Will then thy witness bear,
And with notorious Sinners then
They shall of Judgment share.
The Seventh Part.
1
All thy whole mind and counsel is
Either by thee or thine
Own blessed Apostles plainly known,
There is no truth divine
2
But it in Precepts may be found,
Or Presidents to lie;
For both these are our rule, and of
Equal authority.
3
A Witness ends each doubtful case
Which long sometimes depend;
So thou will also very plain
Each doubtful matter end.
4
A Witness does his witness give,
If it be just and true
To righteousness, to nndeceive
Such which before he knew
5
To be false Men, and wittingly
The matter would evade;
But so their evidence does try,
A stop to all is made.
So thou, O Lord, to righteouness
Thy witness do bring in,
That all false Souls who are deceived
By Satan or by sin,
Shall be convinced, and silent be
By thy own faithful word;
And all their foolish Pleas they will see
No help will them afford.
The Eighth Part.
1
Thou, Lord, do say there is life in thee
For all who do believe;
And that all such shall certainly
Free pardon then receive:
2
Nay more than this we do espy
Thou do bear witness too,
That all who don't repent truly,
To Hell at last shall go.
3
And if Men are not born again,
Whoever, Lord, they be,
They under wrath shall all remain,
And not God's Kingdom see.
4
Thou, Lord, a Witness art for those
Who unto truth adhere,
And with thee do sincerely close;
But such that Rebels are,
5
And thy Record do not receive,
Against all such we know
Thou will thy dreadful witness give,
And then to Hell they go:
6
But yet this witness joy does bring
To such who godly be;
Ah! he will keep you to the end,
That glory you may see.
7
To God the Father, and the Son,
And Holy Ghost therefore,
Be glory, honor and renown
Now and for evermore.
HYMN 47.
Isa. 9. 6. His name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, etc.
1
THy name, O Lord, is wonderful,
And wonderful thou art;
We stand amazed and wonder do,
And so does every heart
2
That has a saving sight of thee,
They all are in a maze
Whilst they behold thy majesty,
God does to glory raise.
3
Thy Name, O that is Wonderful,
So is thy Nature too;
Thy Saints do marvel, well they may,
For Angels wonder do;
They see with strange astonishment:
Should Heaven and Earth combine
o search out thy perfections great,
Them can they never find
To such degree as, Lord, in thee
They gloriously do shine:
Strange was thy Birth, all Saints on Earth
Cry thou art all divine.
6
All praise and glory now therefore
We unto thee do sing,
And do resolve yet more and more
To magnify our King.
The Second Part.
1
Is It not a Wonder a Woman,
As Holy Writ does say,
Should in such sort compass a Man,
Who with Man never lay?
2
To see him whom the World did make,
Of a poor Virgin born!
To see him who was God most high,
Left like to one forlorn!
3
To see the Heir of both the Worlds
In a base Manger lie;
And Blessedness it self to be
Doomed to misery!
4
To see the Ancient of all days,
A Babe of a day old!
To see one Person God and Man
The wonder does unfold!
5
He that the Heir of all things was,
Whom Angels honored,
Is now so mean and poor that he
Has no place to lay's head.
6
Unto thy name so Wonderful
Be glory now therefore;
O let us look and wonder still!
Yea, wonder evermore.
The Third Part.
1
The wonders of thy Life were much,
Strange wonders in thy Death;
The wonders of thy Blood are such,
It all astonished has.
2
Thy Power's great and wonderful,
Strange wonders in thy Love;
Great wonders we do see below,
But stranger are above.
3
Let Us look, and love, and wonder still,
Till we are ravished;
Our hearts with grace, Lord, do thou fill,
So shall thy fame be spread
4
By us: And whilst we wonder do,
Let Us think upon that day
When greater wonders out will flow
To do all ^in away:
And when to the great wonderment
Thou will in glory come,
With all thy mighty Angels too,
To carry us all home,
6
Then shall thou be admired
By all thy Children dear,
And they with thee (as it is said)
In glory shall appear.
HYMN 48.
Isa. 9. 6. Wonderful, Counselor.
1
A Counselor, ye and the chief,
Most wonderful art thou;
For we do see (for to be brief)
All things, Lord, thou do know.
2
None understand all Rites and Laws
But, Lord, thy self alone,
And soon can thou find out what flaws
There is in any one.
3
All secrets of State is with thee,
Thou know thy Father's Will,
And agitates all things below
With strange and wondrous skill.
4
It Is thou must counsel give to us,
Thy counsel it is good,
But woe be unto all those souls
Thy counsels have withstood.
5
O then for counsel, Lord, let us come
To thee continually,
And to thy praise sing all our days
Until we come to die.
The Second Part.
1
A matter, Lord, of sharp contest
Betwixt two Parties were,
And God has thee alone invest
To make the matter clear.
2
Man stands charged by the great God,
As worthy is to die
For Treason, which notorious is
Against his Majesty:
3
But there is a Friend from Heaven come
Who in our stead does say,
That he will bear the Sinners doom,
And all his debts defray.
4
Now will it stand in sacred Laws,
It Is thou our Counsel art,
Can Justice find, Lord, any flaws?
Thy judgment now impart:
5
Will it hold good in the Court above,
That guilty Sinners may
This way be freed? Can this remove
And take their guilt away?
6
Can God be just, and yet forgive?
O bring thy sense now in!
Can we acquittance, Lord, receive,
And pardoned be of sin
7
By righteousness another wrought,
And death which he did die?
Can guilty Man from guilt be freed?
Can that him justify?
8
To end this Cause thou did come here,
The Matter's left to thee;
And thou do say the Sinner's clear
This way, and so shall be.
The Third Part.
1
Lord he that does on thee rely,
And union does obtain;
And to thy righteousness does fly,
He Is freed from every stain
2
Of sin and guilt in sight of God,
And justified is he,
Though on his soul may lie a load,
Because he cannot see
3
That pardon and that freedom yet
That Is in thy self alone;
But pores on his iniquity,
Which he finds is not gone
4
Off his own Conscience, but does feel
'Body of sin and death;
Yet thou to him this truth does seal,
That he a pardon has.
5
Wherefore thy holy praises great
All Ages shall record;
Thy people shall give thanks to thee
For evermore, O Lord.
The Fourth Part.
1
We are about a great Estate,
An assurance fain would have;
The way to us do thou relate,
Thy counsel we do crave:
2
The Title's good, that is not the thing
We do enquire about,
But how to settle it on us,
And lasting Deeds sue out,
3
That none us disinherit may,
Thy counsel give, O Lord!
O show to us the ready way,
According to thy Word!
4
It Is thou must seal to us the Lease,
O let it be for ever!
Thy Spirit is the Seal, let us
The same of thee procure.
5
Lord, let the Title firmly stand,
Unto thy Servants thus
Confirm the matter took in hand,
That grace may shine in us.
The Fifth Part.
1
We charged with sad crimes all are,
Such misdemeanors vile,
If thou do not the matter clear,
Our comforts they will spoil.
2
The Law and Conscience both agree
To lay, Lord, at our door
The highest Treason that can be:
Call thou the matrer over,
3
Acquit us of this fearful charge,
Thou able art ^o plead
The Merits of thy Blood at large,
Thereby it is we are freed.
4
O when our Cause is good, it is thou
That on our side do stand;
No bad Cause thou we well do know
Wilt ever take in hand.
5
O it is a blessed thing indeed
We interest have in thee;
No counsel shall we ever need,
If we will ruled be.
6
To the high Court thou do belong,
There thou chief Counsel art;
And thou will save us from all wrong,
And good advice impart.
7
Ye righteous in the Lord rejoice,
His holiness proclaim;
Be thankful, and with heart and voice
Praise ye his glorious Name.
The Sixth Part.
1
Into the presence of the King
Thou have admittance, Lord,
And nothing does he hide from thee;
Nay more, at thy own word
2
What e're we ask, or is our suit,
If we do but believe;
If it be things thou do think fit,
We shall the same receive.
3
Thy counsel it shall stand we know,
What Enemies design
Thou quickly can quite overthrow,
And save that Church of thine.
4
And now all you that counsel need,
Repair unto this Friend,
His counsel never reject be sure
Which to you he does send.
5
O buy of him that precious Gold,
(White Raiment then get on,)
And blessed Eye Salve, to behold
This glorious, lovely One:
6
And by his counsel be you led
Until you come to die,
Then shall you sing with crowned heads
Unto eternity.
HYMN 49.
^ Cor. 3. 11. Another Foundation can no Man lay, but that which is already
laid, which is Jesus Christ.
1
WE have, O Lord, a House to raise,
And would have it stand sure,
And never know the least decays,
But firm abide for ever:
2
And that we might thus build our souls
Thou the Foundation art;
Here build we must our House, O Lord,
The whole and every part.
3
God has himself in mercy great
This sure Foundation laid,
That so to build our hopes on thee
We might not be afraid.
4
Thy Church on this Foundation is
Most firmly built also;
From hence it is that Men cannot,
Nor Devils it overthrow.
5
A Foundation's laid by knowing Men,
Some skilful Architect;
But this Foundation thou have laid,
As wisdom did direct.
6
Yea, the wisdom of the Trinity
In The Council held above;
And mercy was, Lord, in thine eye,
'Twas bowels did thee move
7
To bring this Stone, so choice and pure,
Beyond the rarest Gold,
To lay us a Foundation sure
Most glorious to behold.
8
To the Foundation now therefore
We will together sing,
To raise the praise for evermore
Of God and Christ our King.
9
'Twas deeply laid in thy Decree,
No bottom can be found;
So deep, Lord, all thy counsels be,
We in them, Lord, are drowned.
The second Part.
1
What kind of House thou did intend
To build, we may perceive
If the Foundation we observe,
And not our selves deceive,
2
It is a Precious stone we see,
No Jasper is so rare,
And all the Building ought to be
As precious, lovely, fair.
3
All Gold and Silver, Precious-stones,
No Wood', Hay nor Stubble;
And living ones they must be all,
Believers meek and humble.
4
As the Foundation does uphold
The whole (...) Fabric;
Thou do bear up each Stone, O Lord,
All Members to thee stick:
5
Each Soul thou do unite to thee
In sure bonds of Love;
O there is a blessed harmony
Among Saints born from above.
6
Without this safe Foundation, Lord,
No Building's there at all;
If any do not on thee build,
Their Souls and hopes will fall:
7
Yet shall the Just in thee rejoice,
Who trust, Lord, in thy might;
They shall Praise sing with mind and voice
Whose hearts with thee are right.
The Third Part.
1
Other Foundations may decay,
Or Men may dig them down;
But this does stand like to a Rock,
It cannot be overthrown.
2
Let Devils do whatever they can
They cannot it undermine:
Art thou built here, O happy Man!
Great safety shall thou find:
3
Here build your Faith, your Hope, and all
Your Comforts too likewise;
Then let Winds blow, ye never shall
Fall by your Enemies.
4
But woe to such who lay aside
This precious Cornerstone,
And build on works through their great pride,
Their hopes will soon be gone.
5
All build do on the Sands besure,
Or no Foundation have,
Who don't true Faith of God procure,
Their precious Souls to save.
6
O blessed Sion thou art strong,
For God has founded thee
Upon a Rock, that none can wrong,
Thou ruined can not be.
7
The Gates of Hell shall not prevail,
So firmly thou do stand:
Ye Saints, how can your courage fail
Too on the other hand.
8
Come sing with joy to Christ therefore
And on him do depend;
The Top-stone and Foundation's he,
O sing world without end.
HYMN 50.
Matthew. 23. 37. How often would I have gathered thy Children together, as a Hen
gathers her Chickens under her Wings.
1
THy Bowels unto Sinners, Lord,
Is showed by the Hen,
Who in her care of all her young
Does far exceed some Men.
2
How will she fly into the face
Of such who would destroy
Her pretty Brood! she cannot endure
They should them once annoy.
3
But ah! thy bowels far exceed
All Creatures here below;
For thou for Sinners, Lord, did bleed,
Compassion great to show.
4
The Hen herself to weakness brings
Whilst of her young takes care,
How does she scratch and strive each day
To feed them here and there?
5
But, Lord, thou brought thy self so low
That we might all be sed,
That in the grave a while did lie
After that thou wast dead:
6
And as a Hen does cluck and call
According to her kind,
Thereby to save her Chickens all
From Kites, which she does find
7
Do often of them make a prey,
So do thou call and cry
To Sinners, whilst it is to day,
Whom thou do, Lord, espy
8
To be in danger by their sin
And Devils many ways;
Nay, thou do call and call again
Full ost, for many days.
The Second Part.
1
The Hen stands ready and prepared,
Hovering her mournful wings,
And never is she satisfied
Till under them she brings:
2
So thou do spread thy Arms, O Lord,
Poor Sinners to bring in,
And bids the weary come to thee
Who laden are with sin.
3
O then come in ye Sinners all
Under Christ's wings with speed,
He will receive you great and small,
And nothing shall you need.
4
And O how safe are you his Saints!
Under his wings you lie;
Then fear no hurt from outfard Foes,
Nor inward Enemy.
5
They who are wise will certainly
In mind these things record,
And so they will with ease espy
The kindness of the Lord.
HYMN 51.
Mal. 3. 3. He shall sit as a Refiners fire.
1
THou like as a Refiner does
The Gold and Silver try,
We had much dross until thou did
Our Souls, Lord, purify.
2
Into the Furnace we were cast,
Which often is very hot;
It Is not our Grace i'th'least to waste,
But filth which we have got.
3
Afflictions like as fire does
The Gold rarely refine,
Purge all our Souls, and we thereby
More gloriously may shine:
4
But Dross will not the Fire bear,
So some, Lord, cannot stand
Before thee when thou do rise up
To scourge them with thy hand.
5
The fire makes the Gold more soft,
So by Afflictions we
More pliable, O Lord, are brought
To yield and bend to thee.
The Second Part.
1
Gold when it is triy'd, it is pure made
By the Refiners art;
So by afflictions thou do, Lord,
Mor'e holy make each heart.
2
From hence we may the reason see
Why God afflictions brings,
And clearly also may discern
What profit from them springs.
3
We fitted are hereby, O Lord,
For our own Master's turn,
Who golden Vessels will make us
Before that he has done.
4
When you refined by trials are,
What cause have you to sing,
And praise the Lord that ever he
Did you in's Furnace fling.
HYMN 52.
Exodus 19. 4. I bore you on Eagles wings.
1
THe Eagle is the King of Birds,
Ah! who is like to thee
Who is so strong? or has an Eye
So quick, and far to see?
2
Like to an Eagle thou do mount,
Or did ascend on high,
Not only up unto the Clouds,
But far above the sky:
3
And as the Eagle thou do bear
Upon thy blessed Wings
All thy poor Saints, and they hereby
Forget all earthly things;
4
They soar so high sometimes, O Lord,
Born upon Wings of Love,
That Earth to them seems a small thing,
They dwell so high above:
5
And as the Eagle's way's not known
Who mounts up in the Air,
Even so thy love and wisdom both
Most deep and hidden are.
6
O fly ye Saints your selves to hide
Under Almighty Wings,
And safe you will be whatever betide,
When God sore judgments brings.
7
O see Christ's care, and do not fear,
But sing his Praises forth;
His grace and love's beyond compare,
None like him here on Earth.
HYMN 53.
Heb. 2. 10. To make the Captain of our Salvation perfect through sufferings.
1
THou art our Captain General,
Thy Commission sealed is;
Rouse up ye Soldiers great and small,
No Captain like to this.
2
Thou have the power given thee
To raise a mighty Host,
And thou beats up to bring them in
Daily from every Coast.
3
It Is thou do nominate who shall
Have office under thee,
And they Commissions have likewise
Who rightly entered be.
4
Thou have thy Soldiers names set down
In thy own Muster-roll,
Within the blessed Book of Life
Is written every Soul:
5
And out of that sweet Book of thine
They shall not blotted be,
If they are such thy Father has
Lord Jesus given to thee.
6
Unto our Captain General
A new Song let us sing;
For he that Captain is in Chief
Is our God, and our King.
The second Part.
1
Thou do, Lord Christ, thy Soldiers lead,
Before them did thou go;
All Foes by thee are vanquished,
Thou did triumph also
2
Over them all most gloriously,
And perfect now art made,
Has Captive took Captivity,
We*ll never be afraid,
3
But stand unto our Arms always,
No Quarter we will give;
If thou art with us all our days,
Few Enemies shall live.
4
Let us be well disciplined,
And very skilful be,
And in right paths and footsteps tread,
And truly follow thee.
5
No Captain does his Men advance
To such high dignity;
For each shall have pre-eminence
To sit on Thrones with thee.
6
O then let us lift up our head
O happy Israel,
Christ's Banner over you is spread,
Your glory shall excel.
The Third Part.
1
Thou giv'st the Word too of Command,
What it is that we must do;
But never bidst us still to stand,
Nor backward for to go.
2
We never must, Lord, wheel about,
Nor be as once we were;
But forward march with courage stout,
Without all dread or fear.
3
Let Us take Example, Lord of thee,
Resist even unto Blood
Before yield to iniquitiy,
Which has us often withstood.
4
It Is thou have power to cashier
All such thou do not like,
If any false hearted appear,
Their names out thou will strike.
5
No Warriers like to thee in fight,
Thy power and thy skill
Are both of them even infinite,
Who then engage thee will?
6
If any should, woe to them all
I once thou draws thy Sword,
And in thy wrath on them do fall,
They die shall then, O Lord.
The Fourth Part.
1
Come in, come in, and list your selves,
You shall have present pay,
Your Souls shall be with grace well stored,
Your charges to desray.
2
It Is th'ready way to become great
And rich, will you come in?
The Trumpets sound, and Drums do beat
To war against your sin.
3
Will you be on our Captains side?
Ah! if you still stand out,
His Sword e're long will you divide
With them that turn about:
4
For if Deserters there be found,
Better not to be born,
His wrath to such will so abound,
To pieces they will be torn.
5
Ye Saints your Leader follow close,
And see that you do keep
To the Company you have chose,
And from them do not slip.
6
Lest you Deserters should be thought,
Keep then your place be sure
In that same Truth to which you're brought,
Lest wrath you do procure.
HYMN 54.
Rev. 22. 16. I am the bright and morning star.
1
THe Morning Star it does appear,
The day approaches now;
See how Christ shines! how lovely, fair
O cast your eyes, see how
2
His light does sparkle brighter still,
The day will quickly break,
And until then he guide us will
In The way that we should take.
3
None is so glorious in our sight
As the sweet Morning Star;
Ah! thou out-shines it, art more bright
Than all the Angels far.
4
The Morning Star, that name is sweet,
So is that name of thine;
O with thy glorious beams let us meet,
For they are all divine.
5
In Winter it is the Morning Star
Is so delighted in;
How good's thy Light, whilst we do find
The Clouds and Night of Sin!
6
The Morning Stars did all rejoice
When this Star did arise;
^ let us with the Churches sing
His lasting praise likewise.
HYMN 55.
Rev. 16. 15. Behold I come as a Thief.
1
YE Saints about you look with speed,
Christ's coming does draw near;
O watch with care, and take great heed,
As a Thief he will appear:
2
Not like a Thief unrighteously
To do Men any wrong,
But unawares most suddenly,
Though many think it is long.
3
Like as a Thief comes in the night
When people are all still,
And puts them all into a fright,
So thy dread coming will
4
Surprise the Earth, and all who sleep,
How will they quake with fear!
O Sinners then will cry and weep
When thou, Lord, do appear:
5
Then will they seek some place to hide
Themselves from the great God;
But though they cannot his wrath abide,
Yet will they find no shroud
6
Nor cover which can shelter them
From his most angry frown;
For vengeance shall their Souls consume,
And quickly bring them down.
7
The coming of a Thief you may
Prevent by taking care,
But, Lord, thy coming to prevent
No way at all is there.
8
But will he come, and quickly too?
Ye Saints rejoice and sing,
Your glory then will overflow
Like to lasting Spring.
HYMN 56.
Hag. 2. 7. The desire of all Nations sha^^ come.
1
THere is enough in Christ to fill
All Nations of the Earth;
The Nations never will be still
Until be shall come forth.
2
Some in all Nations long for peace,
Therefore desire thee;
and wars, O Lord shall never cease
Until the Prince they see.
3
The Nations long for some great thing,
Their desires are for good;
and all true good from thee does spring,
Though not well understood.
4
All Nations now desire thee not,
Yet some do in each Land;
and all the Earth for thee will thirst,
And yield to thy command.
5
All those who see of thee a need,
Know the necessity
They have of help, their Souls do bleed
Until thee they do see.
6
O then Lord Jesus come away,
We know thou did appear
^lready once, but do not stay,
Again lets see thee here.
HYMN 57.
Isa. 9. 6. Prince of Peace, etc.
1
IN thee, O Lord, true peace is found,
Our peace O thou did make,
Which lasting is, and shall abound
In thee, and for thy sake.
2
Thou have the power of a Prince,
Nay Peace thou can command;
O*re War thou have pre-eminence,
Can stop it with thy hand.
3
If thou do once but speak the word,
Peace we shall have within;
By thy own Spirit thou can, Lord,
Destroy each cursed sin.
4
Thou to our Souls sweet peace do give,
Thy Church has peace from thee;
How happily do all such live
Who filled with it be!
5
The Nations, Lord, will ne*re have peace
Until thou do appear;
Thou will make Wars, O Lord to cease
Far off, and also near.
6
Blessed days of peace will be e're long,
We therefore, Lord, will sing,
And quickly shall too a new Song
Unto our glorious King.
HYMN 58.
Act. 10. 42. He that was ordained of God to be the Judge of the quick and
Dead.
He Is come, he is come, the Throne is set,
The Trumpets sound aloud,
Behold the thousands at his feet,
O see the mighty crowd.
2
Great is this day, great is the throng,
Millions of millions stand;
And all that thought this day was long,
They are on his Right Hand:
3
But O the millions, millions who
Are on his Left Hand placed,
Ah, see how they now tremble do!
How wan, and how pale-faced
4
They now appear! Ah, now they see
Their folly, but too late!
They now with grief tormented be
To see their wosul state!
5
The Trumpet sounds exceeding high,
The Cherubs clap their wings;
O hear the Saints melodiously
With all the Angels sing!
6
But hark, the Books are called for!
Ah, Christ is on the Throne!
The wicked now how do they cry!
O hark how they do groan!
HYMN 59.
The Second Part.
Sing this as the 25th. Psalm.
1
THou, Lord, art the high Judge,
Most righteous art also;
And all the world must judged be,
And their rewards have too.
2
Impartially proceed
Will thou in that great day,
And every Man's Indictment read,
And hear what they can say.
3
The honor of the Lord,
The mighty God above,
Thou seekst to raise, and now thou will
All doubts of Men remove.
4
Now all the works of men,
And thoughts of every heart
Shall unto Judgment come, and then
Shall all have their deserts:
5
The Books shall open be
Of Law and Gospel too,
And Conscience shall be called upon
To charge, or clear also.
6
All deeds of darkness shall
Be brought unto the light;
For nothing can be hid at all
From the great Judge's sight.
7
O think upon this day,
And for it now prepare;
For quickly Christ will come away,
Who will no Sinners spare.
The Third Part.
1
How dreadful is a righteous Judge
To such who guilty be!
But none like thee, O holy One,
Clothed in Majesty.
2
Thy Countenance how will it shine
Much brighter than the Sun;
All wicked ones will weep and pine,
And see themselves undone:
3
Conscience will in that dreadful day
The guilty Sinner fright,
And all his deeds before him lay
Done by him day or night.
4
None shall be suffered there to speak
Or answer for his Friend,
But every one must for himself
His own state recommend:
5
The Witnesses shall be called in,
And many will appear,
And God himself he will be one,
Who all things knows most clear.
6
Conscience also shall called be
His witness in to give,
Who next to God all things does see,
And knows how Men do live.
7
Angels likewise both good and bad
Their Evidence may bring,
Who quick inspection always had
Of Men in every thing.
The Fourth Part.
1
No mercy then for guilty ones,
The Judge will be severe;
Christ will not mind the Sinners groans,
Who wicked have been here.
2
This is the only time of Grace,
It Is now Men must repent,
When th^^ day comes, there is no place,
Although they may relent.
3
The Wicked shall the Sentence hear,
Depart ye cursed all;
And being bound up hands and feet,
In flaming fire must fall:
4
And ever there too shall they lie,
The fire can not go out;
And their worm never more shall die,
Which will be sad no doubt.
5
O then poor Sinners lay to heart
Your folly, to Christ fly;
And leave thy sins, whoever thou art,
For that day draws nigh.
The Fifth Part.
1
O Sing ye Saints, you have a Friend
Who for you will appear
If you are faithful to the end
Whilst you do now live here,
2
Christ, when he comes, will clear you all,
And wipe all tears away;
And ye shall sing, and triumph shall
In glorious array:
3
Ye shall the happy Sentence hear,
O Come ye blessed Ones,
The blessed of my Father dear,
And take your glorious Crowns.
4
This being so, ye Saints break forth
And say, O Come away,
O blessed Judge of Heaven and Earth!
O haste, and do not stay.
HYMN 60.
Mat. 22. 11, 12. And he said unto him, Friend, how came thou hither, not
having on a Wedding Garment?
1
OF Garment; there is necessity,
Since sin at first came in;
We needed none when Innocent,
We naked were by sin:
2
So a righteousness we must have all,
Sinners all naked be;
We lost our Clothes by Adam's Fall,
Must now be clothed by thee.
3
A Garment covers our shame,
Sin is a filthy thing;
Thou to hide it, Lord, hither came,
Thy Robe's a covering.
4
Thy Righteousness is that Robe too
Which hides all filth within;
Such shall no shame for ever know,
Who have no stain of sin.
5
Thy Righteousness is spotless, pure,
And thou do it impute
To us, O Lord, we have it sure,
And well it does us suit:
For nothing but this Garment could
Make us accepted be;
None justified ever shall
Without it be by thee:
7
But every one that has this on
They justified are,
And therefore let Believers sing
Who this rich Robe do wear.
The Second Part.
1
A Garment must exactly fit
Such who do put it on;
Thy Righteousness alone is it
That suits each gracious One.
2
In every case the Law has all
It can desire to have,
And Justice says she never shall
More of Believers crave:
3
It suits so well in each degree,
And Saints also do find
It suits them so, nothing can be
Exacter to their mind:
4
For it does with God's wisdom suit,
And clothes our souls and heart;
And hides all our desormities,
Nay covers every part,
5
From head to foot, so that such seem
To have no spot at all;
It gloriously does fit all them,
Be they great ones or small.
The Third Part.
1
A Wedding Garment is a sign
Of joy and sweet delight,
And so that righteousness of thine
Is, Lord, in our own sight:
2
In it we do rejoice always,
It Is this which makes us glad;
Such may rejoice well all their days
Who are so bravely clad.
3
A Wedding Garment it is also
Richly Embroidered,
No Princess e're was clothed so
That King did ever wed:
4
It shines bespangled with Gold,
And such who have it on
The King with joy does them behold,
And loves to look upon.
5
How may we then continually
In Jesus Christ rejoice!
And sing to him melodiously
With heart and cheerful voice!
The Fourth Part.
1
All who did unto Weddings come
Amongst the Jews of old,
Must all have Wedding-Garments on
The Bridegroom to behold:
2
So every Soul who clothed is not
With Christ's blessed righteousness,
Shall be ashamed at the last day,
And then be quite speechless.
3
This Garment serves for every use,
And cannot get a stain;
We need not fear the least abuse,
It saves from hurt and pain:
4
It Is Armour-proof unto the heart,
Its worth is infinite,
It saves us from each fiery Dart
Of Satan's, day and night.
5
O then poor Sinners will you see
This Garment to obtain?
'T will cover your iniquity,
And leave in you no stain;
6
That in God's sight you shall appear
Lovely to look upon;
Without it you undone all are,
And perish shall each one:
7
But let the Saints rejoice and sing,
For their infirmities
Are all past over by the King,
Though many evils lies
8
Open to them, whilst inwardly
They on their sins do pore,
But shortly all their sins shall fly,
And seen be never more.
HYMN 61.
Col. 3. 11. But Christ is all in all, etc.
1
AH what art thou, Lord Jesus, then?
What can we speak or shall?
Thou art unto all godly Men
Even their all in all.
2
Thou all in first Creation wast,
All things were made by thee,
And all things for thee too were made,
Whatever, Lord, they be.
3
And thou all things do now uphold,
Of all things do dispose;
Thou wast before all things of old,
And do all things disclose.
4
Thou Heir also of all things art,
All things are given thee;
And all things do to such impart
Who called and chosen be.
5
The substance of all shadows too
The Antitype, likewise
Of all the Types we read of do,
Who would thee then not prize?
The Second Part.
1
IN our Redemption thou art all,
Thou did atonement make;
Thou purchass'd grace for great and small,
All have it for thy sake.
2
In our Election thou art he,
From whence to us it springs;
And also we were chose in thee,
Which so much comfort brings.
3
In Satisfaction we do find
Thou all in all art; so
'T was in thy own Eternal Mind
Grace on us to bestow.
4
According to thine own purpose
We all too called be,
Grace never had took hold on us
Had it not been through thee.
5
In Justification thou art all,
For it is in thee alone
We righteousness have since the Fall,
Besides thine there is none.
6
In Sanctification thou likewise
Art all in all, O Lord;
In thee alone this Blessing lies,
And by thy Holy Word
7
And Spirit we are all made clean,
New habits from thee flow;
And all that ever washed have been,
To thee they owe it do.
The Third Part.
1
(...), our Acceptance is in thee,
O thou beloved One;
No Soul shall e're accepted be,
But through thy Blood alone:
2
And all in our Salvation then
Thou art in every thing,
Thou have the Author of it been,
And grace from thee does spring.
3
By thee we all are quickened,
And raised to life again,
Who in our sins all once lay dead,
But now in life remain.
4
And in Regeneration
Ah! thou art all in all;
We are renewed by the Son,
It Is thou who do install
5
Each Soul in that high dignity
That waits on the new birth;
We were begotten, Lord, by thee,
And by thee are brought forth.
The Fourth Part.
1
In every Ordinance also
In which we should be found
O thou art all; for we well know
Grace in thee does abound.
2
The Sacraments do hold thee forth,
And witness bear to thee;
And we by one to see by Faith
Thou nailed was to the Tree;
3
Thy Body broke, and Blood was shed;
In Baptism we do ^spy
Thou in the Grave wast covered,
But long thou did uot lie:
4
But as the Body raised is
That covered was all over,
So thou wast raised unto lise,
And die now no more.
5
In Prayer and Preaching thou art all,
What do we preach save thee?
It Is on thy Name we also call,
And for thy sake have we
6
Whatever we do need or want,
We by thy Spirit cry,
And through thy Incense every Saint
Receives a full supply.
7
What is there more? What can we do,
But in the great'st amaze
To stand and think, and evermore
Sing forth thy worthy praise.
HYMN 62.
Christ all from the Father, to the Father, with the Father.
Sing this as the 100dth. Psalm.
1
LOrd, from the Father thou art all
And to the Father art the same,
And with the Father; when we call
We have all things, and in thy Name
2
All from the Father thou did take,
Which to us thou art pleased to give;
Thou came our Souls alive to make,
We from thy self that life receive.
3
Thou to the Father the way art,
The truth and life are all in thee;
Unless thou do thy help impart,
The blessed Father we cannot see.
4
All with the Father art besure,
Thou have always thy Father's Ear;
Thou Favor with him do procure,
When we to him through thee draw near.
The Sixth Part.
1
Now let all People on the Earth
Sing to the Lord with cheerful voice,
Whose love was such to bring thee forth,
But chiefly let thy Saints rejoice.
2
The Lord to us is good indeed,
It Is he new Creatures did us make;
We are his flock, he does us feed,
And for his sheep he does us take.
3
O enter now his House with praise,
Approach with joy his Courts likewise,
Praise, laud and bless his Name always,
For this is comely in his Eyes.
4
For why the Lord our God is good,
His Covenant it stands sure,
It Is ratified by Christ's own Blood,
And shall from age to age endure.
HYMN 63.
The Seventh Part.
Who make Christ their all.
Sing this as the 25th. Psalm.
1
LEt us make Christ our all,
Let Us see we him do love;
To us let all things seem but small,
Let Us value him above
2
House or Land, Husband, Wife,
Or Children who are dear;
Nay him esteem far above Life,
And unto him adhere*
3
Deny all for his sake,
Exalt him evermore,
Then shall we him our all so make
We never shall be poor.
4
Let Us live to him always
By whom we all live do,
Without him let not one soul rest
As pi-as'd with things below:
5
To him let us give all praise,
His glory not divide,
For God did him to glory raise,
To bring down all our pride.
6
On Ordinances do not rest
Without you him enjoy;
Let him by us be so consest,
Let what will us annoy;
7
Yet hold him fast be sure,
Let all go for his sake,
And him let us love for evermore,
O thus your all him make!
HYMN 64.
The Eighth Part.
We must make Christ our all.
1
WE must make Christ our all,
'Cause God over all is he;
And God does him so high extol,
All to him bend their Knee.
2
It Is he who suffered
All things too for our sake,
And all our Foes has conquered,
Your all him therefore make.
3
He all our works has wrought
Without and too within;
Without his strength we can do naught
Against Devil, World, nor Sin.
4
Nothing's of any worth
When to him it is compared;
To make him all God brought him forth,
A Body him prepared
5
To do all things for us,
If him therefore we have,
What is there more that is precious
That we of God can crave.
HYMN 65.
The Ninth Part.
1
CHrist is the Word, in whom is life,
It Is he shall have the glory;
Life to the Dead, the truth of Types,
The truth of ancient story.
2
Christ is a Prophet, Priest and King,
A Prophet that is all Light,
A Priest that stands 'twixt God and Man,
A King full of delight.
3
Christ's Manhood is a Temple where
The Holy God does rest;
Our Christ he is our Sacrifice,
Our Christ he is a Priest:
4
Our Christ he is the Lord of Lords,
Christ is the King of Kings;
Christ is the Sun of Righteousness
With healing in his wings:
5
Our Christ he is the Tree of Life,
In Paradise he grows,
Whose Fruits do feed, whose Leaves do heal,
Ah! Christ is Sharons Rose:
6
Christ is our Meat, Christ is our Drink,
Our Physic, and our Health:
Our Peace, our Strength, our Joy, our Crown,
Our Glory, and our Wealth.
7
Christ is our Father, and our Friend,
Our Brother, and our Love;
Our Head, our Hope, our Surety,
Our Advocate above.
HYMN 66.
The Tenth Part.
1
CHrist is the Shepherd of his Sheep,
Christ is our Mediator;
Christ is the Root, Christ is the Branch,
Christ is our Testator.
2
Christ is the holy Lamb of God,
Christ is our Physician;
Christ is the Way, Christ is the Door,
The Life of every Christian.
3
Christ is God's great Ambassador,
Christ is the only Heir;
Christ is the bright and Morning Star,
Christ is beyond compare.
4
Christ is the Foundation sure,
Christ is the Corner Stone;
Christ is the Witness and the Truth,
Christ is the holy One.
5
Christ is a bundle of sweet Myrrh,
Christ is the Apple Tree;
The Lilly of the Valley too,
Christ he is all to me
6
The Captain of our Salvation,
And Christ is the true Vine;
And Christ is our Counselor,
In Christ all glories shine.
7
Christ is our Heaven of Heavens,
Our Christ what shall we call?
Christ is the first, Christ is the last,
Thus Christ is all in all.
The End of the Second Part.
PART III. Containing Sacred Hymns of Praise ON THE Glorious Excellencies of
the Holy Ghost, Or Third Person of the blessed Trinity.
HYMN 67.
Joh. 14. 16. But I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another
Comforter.
1
LOrd we thy People here on Earth
Do meet with great sorrow;
Though each Soul knows what now he has,
Yet knows not what to morrow
2
May him befall; Afflictions are
Often great, and may increase;
Both from without and from within
We meet with little peace.
3
A Comforter, O Lord, we want,
O send us one we pray
For to sustain each drooping Saint!
O send him strait away!
4
Thou told'st us, Lord, thou would send one
To live with us for ever,
And thou did, Lord, ascend thy Throne
His presence to procure.
5
The Holy Ghost, O it is he!
Our comfort in him lies!
There Is none else, none can have we
Besides to cease our cries.
6
We know, O Lord, he able is
To speak unto our heart;
For troubles he, whatever they be,
Can joy to us impart:
7
And willing he is always too
His helping-hand to lend;
He loves us dear, and will appear,
We have not a sweeter Friend.
The Second Part.
1
Thy Spirit, Lord, is in thy stead
Sweet comfort to afford,
And of him we do stand in need
I'th'absence of our Lord.
2
He visits us, and often does grieve
To see our Souls so sad,
And in our troubles does relieve
Us, though our case be bad.
3
He searches and does try our hearts
To find our sorrows out,
And strives all causes to remove,
And so joy work about.
4
According as he finds our state,
So unto us does speak;
He does reprove as he sees cause,
Which makes our hearts to ache;
5
But presently he smiles again
When we do see our sin,
And puts a period to our pain,
And brings much comfort in.
6
O he is God, and cannot mistake
The state of any one,
And never will our Souls forsake,
Nor leave us all alone;
7
But if he does withdraw at all,
It is our Souls to try;
Where e're we be when we do call,
Ah, he is always nigh!
The Third Part.
1
If thy Spirit, Lord, does speak peace,
We peace besure have;
He can make all our sorrows cease,
And in all troubles save.
2
All Comforters besides him be
Unable to relieve,
Instead of comfort Job did see
They did of joy bereave.
3
The best of them we have below
Can speak but to the Ear,
But, Lord, thy Spirit we all know
Can make our hearts to hear.
4
O then let us not grieve him, Lord,
He is our blessed Fsiend;
If he to us don't help afford,
Our Souls will die in the end;
5
But if we are truly sincere,
He will us never leave,
But in our straits he will appear,
And to us close will cleave.
6
O then let us break forth and sing,
We shall have peace at home;
Our sighs shall go, for we do know
The Comforter is come.
HYMN 68.
Joh. 3. 8. The Wind blows where it lists, etc.
1
THe Wind, Lord, is invisible,
Its way we cannot find out;
No Mortal can thy Spirit see,
Though he does search about.
His motions they most hidden are,
Mysterious in their kind,
That thou do them oft-times compare
To motions of the Wind.
3
The Wind at thy command does blow;
Lord it is as thou do please,
Thy Spirit moves on us below
To wound, or to give ease:
4
According to thy Sovereign Grace
It operates on Men;
Sometimes he does sharply rebuke,
Then cherishes again.
5
Like as the North Wind, so does he
The Worms and Weeds destroy;
Those filthy Vermin which we see,
Our Souls so much annoy*
6
He trials and afflictions lays
On us, and does reprove;
And then sweet Southern-gales displays,
Our sorrows to remove.
The second Part.
1
He like the Wind does Clouds expel,
And makes a clearer Air;
Our ignorance he does repeal,
And makes our Sun shine clear.
2
He, like the Wind, does search and try,
And pierces every part,
By which he does discern and spy
The secrets of each heart.
3
He dryes up all our ways so foul,
And makes our paths more clean;
He makes a holy gracious Soul,
Which had most filthy been.
4
His influence and blessed effects
We oftentimes do feel;
He makes the tender Willows bend,
And mighty Cedars reel:
5
He makes the glory of Man to fade
Like Flowers of the Field,
And throws down houses such have made
Who on the sands do build.
6
He blows oft-times till Rain does fall,
Or Tears do pour amain;
And afterward we see withal
He clears our sky again.
The Third Part.
1
Men with much care and observance
Do mind how the Winds blow;
So we the Spirits influence
Likewise should strive to know.
2
Our Souls becalmed sometimes we see
For want of a fresh gale,
Without thy Spirit move cannot we,
Thy Wind must fill our sail.
3
Sometimes thy Spirit blows so slow
As if it quite were still,
Yet at such times his work does do
With strange and wondrous skill:
4
From all which things it does appear
The Spirits Operations
Are sometimes less, and sometimes more,
He differs in his motions.
5
Let Us cry to God who holds the Winds
In his Almighty Fist,
Who makes it blow this way or that,
As he himself does list;
6
That he would send a fresher gale
Upon his Garden so,
That our sweet Fruit may never fail,
But Spices forth may flow.
HYMN 69.
1 Thessalonians. 5. 22. Quench not the Spirit.
1
O Lord it is sharp, it is very cold,
A Fire let us have;
We seem benumbed both young and old,
Thy Spirit we do crave,
2
It Is that will warm and quicken us
Who are so flat and dead;
Shall we lie starving and chilled thus,
As if all joys were fled?
3
There is in us so little heat,
Our Spirits are so faint,
O blow thy fire we entreat,
That spark in ev'y Saint:
4
It does give light, and also warmth,
Yea 'twill revive us so,
That we shall mount and high ascend
Above all things below.
5
Let it consume and seize upon
That Chaff which is within;
O let it burn in every one,
And quite consume our sin!
6
Ye Saints take heed ye quench it not,
But let it vehement burn,
And kindle so, that every sin
It may to Ashes turn.
7
Without this fire we cannot work,
Nor any business do,
Life, motion, and activity,
Always from him does flow.
HYMN 70.
1 John 2. 20. But ye have an Unction from the holy One.
1
OUr wounds do stink, and are corrupt,
Hard swellings we do see;
We want a little Ointment, Lord,
Let us more humble be:
2
Thy Spirit will allay our pride,
And bring us to thy feet;
And when that we are softened,
Thy Image on us set.
3
This Oil will heal and mollify,
O pour it quickly in,
That we may live and never die,
Lord, by our cursed sin!
4
This Oil of thine, O it is good
All Poison to expel!
It by the virtue of thy Blood
Does heal thy Israel.
5
Though worst of Venom in us lie,
And has corrupt each part;
Yet if thou do this Oil apply,
'Twill heal our very heart:
6
And if our face anointed be,
'Twill make it glorious shine,
'Twill strengthen us, and make us fat,
Such is this Oil of thine.
7
Thy Oil will not incorporate
With any liquid things;
An Underlin it will not be made,
But to the top it springs.
8
O then afford us Oil we pray
To cheer and make us glad,
And we thy praise will sing always,
And never more be sad.
HYMN 66.
Ephesians. 1. 13. After ye believed, ye were sealed with that spirit of promise
which is the earnest of our inheritance, etc.
1
A Great Estate is purchased,
We would Possession have
Of that blessed Inheritance,
An Earnest therefore crave:
2
Was it not purchased, O Lord,
For us by our dear Friend?
O then a Pledge do thou afford,
An Evidence to end
3
The Controversy that does rise
Continually within,
If we'll believe our Enemies,
Our Title's lost by sin:
4
But we a promise of it have
From thee who can not lie,
And therefore now we humby crave
An Earnest speedily.
5
Like as an Earnest does confirm,
And give an assurance
Of some great purchase, even so
We all may see from hence
6
God's Spirit is unto our Souls
An Earnest of all good,
Which Jesus Christ did buy for us
With his most precious Blood.
7
And as an Earnest when it is given
Does make the Bargain sure,
So certain shall he have Heaven
This Earnest does procure.
The second Part.
1
He that God's Spirit does obtain
Shall grace and glory have;
For he an Earnest of it has
From one that cannot deceive.
2
O then come down, O blessed Dove,
Abide thou in our breast,
To be an Earnest of God's love,
And quietly we'll rest;
3
But cease will not, but always cry
With confidence of Soul,
Thou art our God, O strengthen us,
That none may us control.
4
To God the Father, and the Son,
And Holy Ghost therefore,
Be blessing, honor, and renown,
Now and for evermore.
HYMN 72.
Ephesians. 1. 30. And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed to
the day of redemption.
1
O Lord, now we perceive most clear
Thy love is great indeed;
Ah we shall the Inheritance have
Which thou to buy did bleed.
2
Thou would not, Lord, bought it so dear
Had not thy purpose been
To make it sure unto our Souls
In spite of World, or Sin;
3
And as for us thou did it buy,
And we the Earnest have,
So now we also do espy
A Seal to us does cleave.
4
We sealed are, O that is a thing
Which highly's valued,
And great assurance does it bring
Of what is purchased.
5
It also does impression make
Upon the wax always;
So we thy Image have hereby,
And shall have all our days:
6
But as the wax must melted be
Before it can receive
The impression of the Seal, so we
Are softened who believe:
7
And this does thy blessed Spirit do,
That holy Fire divine
His influences this does show,
Thus does his glories shine.
The second Part.
1
And as a Seal some strive to change,
Or it do counterfeit;
So Satan, who about does range,
Does strive our Souls to cheat.
2
A Seal is used to secure
Things secret and close, so
Thy Saints preserved are hereby
From Men and Devils too.
3
Now see ye who Professors are
That you have melted been,
As softened like the wax; have you
Been broken for your sin?
4
Has any promise been set home
With power on your heart?
Did ever so God's Spirit come
His Image to impart?
5
O what Impression do you find?
Is holiness in you?
Do you now in the Lord delight
More than in things below?
6
Take care you who are sealed Ones
Ye don't the Spirit grieve;
Don't make him sigh with bitter groans,
Since such a Seal you have.
7
O prize him, and unto him live!
He is your dearest Friend;
Due glory see to him you give
Always unto the end.
HYMN 73.
Ephesians. 4. 30. And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, etc.
1
THe holy Spirit grieve do not,
Which God to you does give,
From whom ye have all that rich grace
By which to God we live.
2
It is the Spirit that renews
The Souls of every one
That are brought home to Jesus Christ,
Whose darkness now is gone.
3
All light and comfort does proceed
From his sweet influence;
It Is dangerous then him to grieve,
You may perceive from hence.
4
By him you live, by him you walk,
Without his help cannot we
Do any good; O therefore now
Let him not grieved be.
5
But bless the Lord he is not withdrawn,
O sing his praises forth,
And live to him as long as you
Do live upon the Earth.
HYMN 74.
Romans 8. 16. The Spirit it self bears Witness with our Spirit.
1
O Lord we have a blessed grant
Of an Inheritance,
And so has every holy Saint;
And thy grace to advance,
2
Thou do to us an Earnest give
Of it to make it sure,
And Sealed it is when we believe
Unto us too for ever:
3
But that we might by no means doubt
To make it firmer yet,
A Witness, Lord, thou have found out,
Which thou saw requisite.
4
Sure it is some great and glorious thing
That purchased was so dear;
And 'twill eternal comfort bring
To have a title clear.
5
O let thy Spirit, Lord, come in,
We*ll hear what he can say,
Before we dare once, Lord, attempt
A Claim unto it lay.
6
But since one Witness may not do,
And two required are,
Let Conscience with thy Spirit now
His witness also bear.
The Second Part.
1
Thy Spirit must, Lord, testify
That we are born again;
Is all sin dead? Let Conscience speak
To put us out of pain.
2
Two Witnesses, nay such as these
We'll prize, for they are true;
Ah! they will free us from all fear,
Whatever does ensue.
3
If they together do agree,
The Controversie's gone;
If we new Creatures truly be,
We safe are every one.
4
They Will make us to lift up our head
With joy triumphantly;
All sorrow will be vanquished,
O then let us search and try
5
By thy own Law; for ' it is thy Word
The matter must decide;
Thy Spirit from thy Word, O Lord,
We never must divide.
6
O happy Soul, art thou sincere,
Upright in life and heart?
Do both these jointly witness bear,
That thus also thou art?
7
Then sing the praise of God above,
Who clears to thee this thing;
O with the Spirit fall in love,
And praise our glorious King.
HYMN 75.
Joh. 7. 30. He that believes, out of his Belly shall flow Rivers of living
water.
1
WE of a River now will sing,
A Stream that sweetly runs;
And praise the high and glorious King,
That he the Channel turns
2
This way, to us in these dry Isles,
In The solitary place,
Sweet streams of water do rise up,
God does pour sorth his grace.
3
This makes our Wilderness rejoice,
It Sion does make glad;
And Saints to sing with cheerful voice,
That mourned, and were so sad.
4
This River sweetly soaks the Earth
VVhere-e're its streams do run,
And plenteously he will pour forth
His waters e're he is done.
5
This River, O it is very deep,
The bottom none can know;
Fresh always does its waters keep,
And yet they overflow.
6
Its Banks they are God's holy Word,
That is his lasting bounds;
Oh! where God does his Name record,
There are these waters sound.
7
Over these Banks it will not go,
Nor ever break them down;
VVhoe're they be who make a breach,
They shall be overthrown.
The Second Part.
This River when it swiftly runs
With an impetuous stream,
It drives the Soul to Jesus Christ,
O there is no stopping them:
2
Trees that are planted by its side
How sweetly do they grow?
Like Willows by the Watercourse
And Drought such never know
3
This River brings things from afar.
The best Navigation
Is in this River to set out,
'Twill bring us to Salvation.
4
That Soul which does employ himself,
And work herein each day,
He shall be rich eternally,
And a blessed Scepter sway.
5
The Waters of this River are
Excellent good to drink;
If thou do taste, thou will no more
Upon your sorrows think.
6
No Wines so rare, never could compare
With these Waters besure;
And such who do drink of them too,
Ah! he shall live for ever.
7
Sing to the River, River of God,
Let Sion much rejoice;
O sing ye Saints with one accord
To Christ with cheerful voice.
HYMN 76.
Ezekiel. 36. 25. I will sprinkle clean water upon you. Joh. 7. 30. Out of his
belly shall flow living water, etc.
1
THis River flows from God above,
It from his Throne proceeds,
And sweetly too this way does move,
It many millions feeds.
2
These Waters purge from filthiness,
Come wash and be you clean;
It makes the barren Soul flourish,
And spread his Branches green.
3
It Is cooling to a sweating Soul
That Satan hunts about;
'Twill quench the fire of lusts within,
It does allay our drought.
4
It makes the Seed of Grace to grow,
It mollifies our Earth;
All such its influences know
Who witness the new birth.
5
It heals the wounded Soul likewise,
There Is no disease within
But by these Waters cured have been,
O drink, and drink again!
6
O come unto these Waters ye
Who very thirsty are!
To all that come they are most free,
O drink, and do not spare!
The Second Part.
1
Do not be foolish and mistake,
To go to the wrong Well;
These Waters it is that you must take,
Which far, alas, excel
2
All Waters you can go unto;
Ah! would you healed be?
To Christ by his own Spirit come,
And sickness soon will flee.
3
Ye Fools, what is it that you do drink?
It Is puddle-water base,
It stinks, it is filthy, God it loathes,
O taste of his sweet grace,
4
And sinful joys will hateful be,
And you will spue them up;
Come taste a little Water: See!
Come try! Take one small sup,
5
And you will say God's love, O it is
Most pleasant to your taste!
But the chief sweetness is reserved
For us to drink at last.
6
O praise the glorious God above
These Waters overflow!
Sing praise to Jesus Christ our Lord,
And praise the Spirit too.
HYMN 77.
Luke 12. 12. The holy Spirit shall teach you, etc.
1
WE many things are yet to learn,
Lord, we instructions need;
We fain would all thy Truths discern,
And from all doubts be freed.
2
Some things be dark, and hidden are
That we cannot understand,
And therefore, Lord, to make them clear
By a most skilful hand
3
Thy Spirit have ordained to be
A Teacher unto us,
All praise and glory unto thee
For dealing with us thus.
4
He has all knowledge of thy Laws,
And opens every thing,
And can discover every flaw
That up may seem to spring
5
Within our minds about the way
Wherein we ought to go;
Out of a Book he teaches us
The meaning he does show.
6
He did himself this Book compile,
'Twas he who gave it out,
And therefore can it open well,
And Answer every doubt
7
Unto the ignorant and blind,
If they his counsel take,
God's Kingdom they at last shall find,
And them he will perfect make.
The Second Part.
1
He does not teach to go astray
From thy own written Word,
That Is not thy Spirit, nor the way,
Which does not just accord
2
In every thing we sure are
With thy New Testament,
Lord, all such Spirits we'll not hear,
By thee they were not sent;
3
Thy Word it is a sure Rule,
O let thy Spirit come
And witness to it most graciously,
And every Nail drive home.
4
Let all Convictions close abide
Of sin and duty too,
And let us find each promise firm
Which unto us does flow:
5
And we thy Praises will sing forth,
And never go astray,
When in our Souls thy Spirit does
Tell us this is the way.
HYMN 78.
Mat. 3. 16. And he saw the Spirit descending like a Dove, and lighted upon
him.
1
DOwn from above the blessed Dove
Is come; Ah! shall he rest,
Thou Holy and Eternal One,
With me, O in my Breast!
2
There let thy Spirit dwell, O Lord,
Who has a Dove-like Eye,
Most quick to see; before his sight
All things do naked lie.
3
O he is innocent indeed,
Most harmless, and most meek;
Whoever would from wrath be freed,
His nature they must seek.
4
All such who are gentle and kind,
Most humble in their heart,
This Dove infused it in their mind,
He did that grace impart.
5
Ah! he is swift as any Dove,
And quickly can be here;
Though he descended from above,
Yet is he every where.
The second Part.
1
From sight of thy All-seeing Spirit
O whither can we go?
His Eyes do search all places out,
He walks to and fro
2
Through the Earth, where can we hide?
O whither can we fly,
Lord, from thy presence? 'cause thou art
Far off, and also nigh.
3
Shall we to Heaven mount alost?
Lo, thou art present there!
Or if we should go down to Hell,
Even there thou do appear!
4
Yea, should we take us Morning wings,
And dwell beyond the Sea,
There would thy right hand have fast hold,
And with us quickly be:
5
Nay, if we say the darkness shall
Yet shroud us from thy sight,
Alas! the thickest darkness is
To thee like to the light:
Yea, darkness hides not from thee,
But night does shine as day;
To thee the darkness and the night
Are both alike always.
The Third Part.
1
Thy Spirit's swift, he is swift in flight,
From him there is none can fly;
We ever be, Lord in thy sight,
Thou can us soon supply
2
With all good things which we do need,
And could we get thy VVings,
We should mount up, from fear be freed,
And hate earth's empty things.
3
Behold he is come, an Olive-leaf
Within his mouth we see;
God's wrath is over, it is asswag'd,
O therefore joyful be.
4
Let Us see thy face, and hear thy voice,
And taste thy sweetest love!
O Souls ascend! but O for Wings,
The VVings of Noah's Dove!
5
Then should we fly away from hence,
Leaving this world and sin,
And soon would thou, Lord, reach thy hand,
And kindly take us in.
HYMN 79.
Joh. 16. 13. He will guide you into all truth.
1
WE Strangers are, Lord in the world,
Ah! it is a wilderness,
And many crooked ways there are,
We therefore do confess
2
We want a Guide who skilful is,
Thy Spirit, Lord, is come,
No Guide like him be sure there is,
O let him guide us home.
3
Thy Spirit points unto thy Word,
And shows where dangers lie;
^et's yield our selves with one accord
To him continually;
4
And we shall all be rid of cares,
And never lose our way;
^e true Directions always gives,
We may not go astray.
5
O well it is for us, O Lord,
Who naturally are blind,
That we have such a Guide as this
To stay our doubtful mind.
6
Then sing to him with heart and voice,
No counsel like to his;
He will not leave us till he has
Brought us to lasting bliss.
The End of the Third Part.
PART IV. Containing SACRED HYMNS Illustrating the glorious Excellencies of
God's holy WORD, and blessed Gospel.
HYMN 80.
Psalm. 119. 105. Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light to my paths.
1
LIght is a pleasant thing to see,
Thy Word true Light does give,
Nothing can, Lord, so pleasant be,
It Is that by which we live,
2
By which we walk, by which we work,
And all things else we do;
All they who are without this light,
Don't know whither they go.
3
Thy Word discovery, Lord, does make,
It manifests things;
From thence we do our judgment take,
It Knowledge to us brings:
4
What once we were we know hereby
How sad was then our state;
Sin's filthy nature through it we 'spy,
And it do come to hate.
5
The way of our Salvation too
It does discover clear,
And how thou will be worshipped
Whilst we do all live here.
The Second Part.
1
Who the true Church is we may see,
If thy good Word we heed;
And by it we the false Church know,
Which filthy is indeed.
2
All things that needful are, O Lord,
Unto eternal life,
Is plain discovered by thy Word,
Which ends all doubts and strife
3
That is, has been a long time
Amongst us here on Earth,
About the Church, and Truth of God,
But this all silenced has.
4
Light has a clearing quality,
And by its heat things grow;
And by it too all Fogs do fly,
Such influences flow
5
As does revive and sweetly cheer
The Soul that drooping lies,
They by thy Word, Lord, quickened are,
And all their sorrows flies.
6
Light has a shining quality,
Thy Gospel shines so bright,
That nothing can more glorious be
In all thy Children's sight.
HYMN 81.
Psalm. 19. 10. More are they to be desired than Gold, yea, than much fine Gold.
1
HOw precious is that Word of thine,
Can Gold with it compare,
When it is all sacred, all divine?
No, there is nothing here
2
Like unto it, it is of such worth,
A little quantity
Of it exceeds all things on Earth,
Such glories in it lie.
3
Though Gold does deck the outward Man,
This does the Soul adorn;
Thy Gospel is an Ornament,
Nay, it is thy Peoples Crown.
4
Gold does make Vessels which are rare,
Thy Word and Spirit do
Make golden Saints beyond compare,
And golden Churches too:
5
Yea, Candlesticks of beaten Gold
Are formed out of it,
Which glorious are, Lord, to behold,
But will be rarer yet.
The Second Part.
1
And as Gold is durable, so
It will the trial bear;
Thy Word is tried, and will abide
Whilst Heaven and Earth appear.
2
But O what pains do Mortals use
To get a little Gold!
Which when it is got, it flies away,
And it they cannot hold.
3
O then forbear and labor now
For Gold that will abide,
To lasting glory 'twill bring you,
And fill your Souls beside:
4
Which Gold could never do, nor shall,
That cannot satisfy
The Soul of Man, the thing's too small,
It cannot its wants supply.
5
True peace and satisfaction is
Only in God above;
His Word receive, and ^oon you will
Be filled with his love.
HYMN 82.
1 Pet. 2. 2. As new born Babes desiring the sincere Milk of the Word, that ye
may grow thereby.
1
ARt thou a Babe, though newly born?
What is thy Soul's desire?
Do hunger for Milk of God's Word,
And raise thy cry yet higher?
2
As pretty Babes who want the Breast,
How do they cry amain!
Ah! can thy Soul find no small rest
Till thou do Milk obtain:
3
Then know it is a sure sign
Thou have a heavenly heart,
And God to feed that Soul of thine
Will his sweet Word impart
4
To thee, that thou may grow thereby,
O it is very good;
Milk nourishes and feeds the Child
Better than other Food.
5
Stong Meat thou can not yet digest,
Milk's a Restorative;
God's Word restores decayed Souls,
Nay, makes the dead alive.
6
Milk was a blessing choice of old,
And with it Canaan flowed;
Have thou God's Word? What Blessing then
Better can be bestowed
7
On thee, poor Soul, O prize it much,
And on it always feed,
Twill strengthen thee, and make thee fat,
And nothing shall thou need.
The Second Part.
1
Ye who are Lovers of sweet Milk,
Will, will you now make haste?
O come and buy! this does excel!
We pray you Friends to taste.
2
If you were once born from above,
Though but young Babes you were,
You with this Milk would fall in love,
And say it tastes rare.
3
But whilst your evil nature is
Corrupted thus with sin,
And glutted are continually
With filthy trash within,
4
You cannot relish this sweet Food,
Your Mouths are out of taste,
And therefore you don't find it good,
But want it will at last:
5
But you who are God's little ones,
What cause have you to sing,
That you have plenty still of Milk,
And every other thing.
6
O live to God, and sing again
His blessed Praises forth,
Who feeds, and does replenish you,
And strengthens all your Faith.
HYMN 83.
Heb. 5. 14. Strong meat belongs to those that are of age, etc.
1
SOme of God's Children are grown up
To such maturity,
That they on Meat that is strong can sup,
In which great virtues lie.
2
Young Men and Fathers some there be
Whose senses have been long
In exercise, and therefore they
Are stronger than the young
3
And little Babes, whose Stomach's weak,
And therefore cannot bear
Nor take in dark mysterious things,
Which elder Saints does cheer.
4
It argues such diseased be
Who unto years are grown,
If such Meat with them don't agree,
By which Christ is made known
5
More clearly to the Ear and Eye
Than other Doctrins can,
And therefore we say presently
He Is a diseased Man.
6
Some base disease on him has siez'd,
He Is under some decay,
His stomach rises at God's Word,
And puts it quite away.
The Second Part.
1
But like as Meat that is strong does yield
The better nourishmant,
So such who can strong things take in,
Are not so impotent,
2
Nor never so weak as others be,
But harder work can do,
And unto them continually
Does sweeter comforts flow.
3
Small things do them not soon offend,
But strengthened be to bear
Such things that others startle at,
And cannot abide to hear.
4
O then ye Saints do you see to it,
Your weakness don't betray,
Who have been long in Jesus's School,
Yet stumbling blocks do lay
5
In your own paths, and others too,
And so expose God's Name
To great reproach, but on your selves
Do bring the greatest shame:
6
But let the strong bear with the weak
In things indisserent,
And let the weak more wisdom seek,
Than from the strong to rent,
7
It is a blessed truth of God
For which the strong contend,
Though you being weak do yet not see it,
But may though in the end.
HYMN 84.
Psalm. 110. 133. How sweet are thy words to my taste! yea, sweeter than Honey
unto my mouth.
1
HOw sweet is Honey, and the Comb
In which Honey is found!
But, Lord, thy Word it does excel,
Its sweetness does abound
2
Beyond all things, though never so sweet,
There Is nothing can it show,
Nor set it forth unto its worth
Of things which are below:
3
Nothing with it can once compare,
O do but taste and try;
For none but such can ever tell
What good in it does lie.
4
If you to Honey add such things
Which very bitter are,
The bitterness it does take off,
Nay sweet it does appear
5
Unto the taste; so if you do
With great afflictons meet,
If God a Promise gives to you,
The trial will be sweet.
6
But though Honey so sweet is found,
Yet some do it not love;
So none do find God's Word most sweet,
But those born from above.
The Second Part.
1
For the full stomach often does loath
The Honeycomb so sweet;
So carnal Souls account God's Word
As poor and sorry Meat.
2
Honey is of a purging kind,
God's Word it purges so,
It does make clean both Heart and Mind,
The Life and Lip also.
3
O then be like the pretty Be
Which does industriously
From every Flower she can see
Her self store with Honey.
4
And now ye Saints who sweetness find
In God's most blessed Word,
Sing forth his Praise with joyful Mind
Jointly with one accord.
HYMN 85.
Ephesians. 6. 17. And the Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God, etc.
1
O Lord, we hear War is proclaimed,
And we engaged are
To fight with thee, and in these Wars,
To take our proper share.
2
The Enemy is cruel strong,
And will no quarter give;
And threatens us both old and young,
We shall not much longer live:
3
Thou did overcome him formerly,
He rallies up again
His scattered force, and we espy
We fight must or be slain.
4
O let us have thy mighty Sword!
O there is none like it!
If in our hearts we have thy Word,
We Will bring them to our feet.
5
A Sword all Soldiers must have on,
So every Saint must have
Thy Word to fight with, or else they
Will soon their Souls inslave.
6
A Sword does not only defend
The Soldier in the Field,
But by it he makes Foes to bend,
And unto him to yield:
7
So does thy Word, O holy Lord,
Save us, and yet annoys,
All cruel Foes, it brings them down,
Nay them it quite destroys.
The Second Part.
1
It a two edged Sword is too,
It wounds always with one,
And with the other it does heal
Likewise e're it has done;
2
By its sharp threats it wounds the Soul,
But turn it then again,
It Is Promises does make us whole,
And eases every pain:
3
It will cut off an hand or foot,
Dismember the old Man;
If we do not destroy his Life,
We live, Lord, never can.
4
Wounds of a Sword do mortal prove
If once it pierce the heart;
So let thy Word, Lord, hit our sin,
A mortal wound impart.
5
A Sword does often fright a Foe,
So that he cowardly
Beholding it, away does go,
Nay, swift perhaps does fly;
6
Even so that Soul who has thy Word
Drawn always in his Hand,
Does make his Enemies to run,
A Battle will not stand.
The Third Part.
1
Thy Word is a victorious thing,
A VVeapon which often does
Such execution by thy strength,
Great Armies it o'rethrows.
2
It must be used with greatest skill,
And by a powerful hand;
It Is by thy Spirit we do kill
All Foes who us withstand.
3
No Hand but that this Sword can wield,
The Spirit gives the blow,
We by them both do win the Field,
And Enemies overthrow.
4
The Spirit does thy Word explain,
'Twas forged and given forth
Even by himself, and therefore he
The chiefest glory has.
5
The efficacy of thy Word,
Does in thy Spirit lie,
It an impression never will make,
If he don't it apply.
6
All praise do ye give unto God
Who do its power feel;
Ah! it is a Sword that does excel
The richest made with Steel.
The Fourth Part.
1
Ye Saints hold fast besure your Sword,
And rather die of the spot
Than to be cheated of God's Word;
For should it be your lot
2
It for to lose, you naked are
And will become a prey
Unto the bloody Church of Rome
The very self same day:
3
And see you have skill it to use
When you with Foes do meet,
Or else you never will prevail
To bring them to your feet:
4
And always bless the holy God
Who does to us afford
The blessed Scriptures of Truth,
Prize it with one accord.
HYMN 86.
2 Cor. 3. 18. But we all with open face beholding as in a glass, etc.
1
HOw prone are people generally
To look into a Glass,
But will not look into God's Word
To see their woeful case.
2
There may they see how soul they be,
How loathsome in God's Eyes,
Whilst in their sins they do remain,
Like Swine in filthy Sties.
3
A Glass it is a medium fit
Persons to represent,
So in thy Word we may behold
Our God Omnipotent;
4
Therein his rare Perfections shine,
Yea, his illustrious Face,
In all his glorious Attributes,
His Goodness and his Grace,
5
We in thy Word may these behold
Beyond what we do see;
Those Works of thine, Lord, can unfold,
Or do make known of thee.
6
Here we may see the Father clear,
And Son in glory shine;
Here does the Holy Ghost appear,
And all alike divine.
The Second Part.
1
A Glass, that is true, does represent
A Man's own natural Face,
But he away goes, and forgets
What kind of Man he was:
2
So they who only hear God's Word,
And the same do not do,
The Holy Ghost to such compare,
Which does their folly show.
3
A Glass is used to dress the Head
To put on their Attire;
Come, dress your selves by this rare Glass,
To raise your beauty higher.
4
Here you may see what still you want,
The which you must have on;
Here may you see how fair you be,
That Grace does sweet adorn.
5
You wanton Ones, for shame leave off
Your evil habits, who
Spend so much time in looking in
Your Glasses; Sinners know
6
Your Glasses will in the last day
As Witnesses arise
Against you in judgment severe,
Such folly in it lies,
7
That nothing can more hateful be
Such precious time to spend,
To dress a filthy Head that must
Be eat of Worms in the end,
8
Whilst your poor Soul has nothing on
But stinking Rags most vile,
And is neglected and forgot
By you too all the while.
HYMN 87.
Deuteronomy. 32. 2. My Doctrine shall drop a^ the Rain.
1
LOrd it is a droughty time we see
With us, alas, within,
Our moisture seems all dried up
By Lust, that fire of sin.
2
O thou who do command the Clouds,
Shall now thy Showers fall?
Shall Rain pour out on barren Hearts?
And Dews distill as small
3
Upon the sweet and tender Herb,
That so the one may be
Made soft with Rain, and the other
Refreshed be by thee?
4
The Rain falls at thy dread Command
A Shower here and there;
It Is as thou do, O Lord, appoint
That we of Blessings share;
5
That we enjoy thy precious Word,
Whilst others barren lie,
Who hardly have one drop of Rain
Their wants for to supply.
1
The former Rain was poured out,
It was a mighty shower;
So shall the latter Rain come down
Before this day is over.
2
A little at one time, again
We have a little more;
Thus does thy Word like unto Rain
Refresh thy blessed Poor.
3
Rain makes the Earth both fresh and green,
And every thing to grow;
It Is by thy Word and Spirit, Lord,
We thrive and flourish do.
4
There Is none can stop the Rain that falls,
If thou Commission give,
Thy Word shall come upon us all,
Thy Grace shall make us live.
5
Let sin and Devil do their worst,
Thy Word shall not return
Unto thee empty, it prosper shall,
For thy Will must be done.
The Third Part.
1
Thy Ministers are like to Clouds
Who do the Rain retain;
Of them thou do make equal use
To pour it out again.
2
O let us then cry unto God
His Clouds may all be full,
Not empty ones which hold no Rain,
But do deceive the Soul,
3
And pray that we may always have
Rain as we do it need,
That Grace may grow, and in us all
Spring up like to choice Seed,
4
And praise the glorious God above
Who does such Blessings send;
If we his Mercies do improve,
Our days will joyful end.
5
It Is a sore Judgment when the Lord
Does stop the Bottles of Heaven,
But O it is worse when God's good Word
And Blessings are with-helden.
6
We wisk away, our glory fades
When God his Word denies,
Or does withold his Blessings from't,
Both Faith and Hope then dies.
7
O look to God, remember him
From whom your Fruit does flow!
If you are fruitful, sing his praise,
And live unto him too.
HYMN 88.
Deuteronomy. 32. 3. My Speech shall distill as Dew.
1
AS Dew does insensibly fall,
So does God's gracious Word
Invisibly op*rate in us,
As we have often heard.
2
How sweet are Dews unto the Herb,
It makes them richly smile;
So does thy Word bedew oft-times
Thy own true Israel.
3
It makes our Graces to send forth
A rare and fragrant scent,
Which does delight the holy One,
The Lord omnipotent.
4
But Dews will not, Lord, always do,
Men's hearts so barren are;
Some soaking showers they must have,
If any Fruit they bear.
5
All praise and glory unto God
Who wisely orders things,
That as our wants and needs appear,
His Mercies flow like Springs.
HYMN 89.
2 Cor. 4. 7. But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, etc.
1
THy Word is treasure very rare,
For we do often see
Thou do to Gold the same compare,
And things that glor'ous be.
2
It is, Lord, of so great a worth
No Man can comprehend,
Nor Tongues of Angels set it forth,
All Riches does transcend:
3
Ah! such is thy most holy Word,
Through it thy precious love
To us conveyed is, O Lord,
This does the matter prove
4
That which the best and wisest Men
Esteemed above all things,
And is the channel that let us in
The joy of divine Springs;
5
And does enrich the Soul of Man,
And that eternally;
The worth of it there is no one can
Express assuredly.
The Second Part.
1
Some treasure that in bulk is small,
Yet does in worth excel;
Such is thy Gospel, blessed Lord,
Thy People know it well.
2
One Promise is more worth than all
The Gold which the World has;
If thou do give it, then we shall
Say, What is all the Earth
3
When unto it compared it is?
This Treasure does delight
The Souls of Saints, and makes them sing
To thee both day and night.
4
It has such influence on the Heart,
As earthly Treasure here,
That on thy Word we meditate,
Because our hearts are there
5
Where our chief Treasure even lies,
On that the heart is set,
And hence it is they it esteem
'Bove their necessary Meat.
6
This makes Men great and honorable,
Because much Treasure have;
This also frees from care and trouble,
And does not us inslave
7
To Dunghil-Earth, as Treasures do,
It raises Souls above
All things that are, O Lord, below,
To joy in thy sweet love.
The Third Part.
1
Treasure in Earthen Vessels is
Often laid up by us,
And we know very well, so it is
The Treasure's never the worse:
2
Even so although thy Gold is found
In Ministers so mean,
The worth of it does still abound,
Though some do not esteem
3
Of it, because the Vessels are
D^spis'd; but there is a day
When they shall glorious appear,
And golden Scepters sway.
4
O prize God's faithful Servants then,
Who do enrich your Souls!
O value them above all Men,
And be no longer Fools
5
To grieve them, and to wear them out
By any means, if ye
Would ever, in the Judgment-day
Christ's face with comfort see;
6
For as you 'steem or dis-esteem
True Preachers of God*s Word,
Christ looks upon it as done to him,
Like measures will award;
7
And you whom God does Vessels make
His Treasure to retain,
See that you seek his Praise always,
And don't his Glory stain.
HYMN 90.
Jer. 23. 29. Is not my Word like Fire.
1
THy Word it does illuminate,
It gives forth sweet light,
And also from it we have heat,
Our Graces to excite.
2
Thy Word, like Fire, does consume
Our filth and dross within;
What is combustible does waste,
It siezes on our sin.
3
Fire is of an ascending kind,
It mounts things up aloft;
So they mount up in heart and mind,
Who by thy Word are taught;
4
As fired are by thy own Spirit,
Thy Word without that, Lord,
Will never burn, nor raise our hearts
(As we have newly heard.)
5
Fire will melt and soften things
That hard are naturally;
It Is by thy Word and Spirit we
Do with thy Will comply.
6
It Is that which bends and makes us yield,
And humbles much the heart,
Which naturally was proud and vain,
And too obdurate.
The Second Part.
1
Thy Word it quickens and revives,
Like Fire it does cheer;
It consolates and makes such warm
Who to it do draw near:
2
For they who to it will not come,
No profit can receive;
So such who do reject thy Word,
Their Souls shall not live.
3
Fire will penetrate and pierce,
There is no secret place
Within the Soul, but thy Word will
Most quick and swiftly pass.
4
It does the very Thoughts discern,
Nay it divides between
The Soul and Spirit of a Man,
To sever both from Sin.
5
And Fire is used to lay waste
Houses where Rebels hide,
Even so thy Word does quite consume
The House of Lusts and Pride.
6
Man with vain hopes a House does raise,
And vaunts himself each day;
But when thy Word does sieze on him,
His House consumes away.
7
All his vain hope he had before,
It is consumed and gone,
And a new Temple up is raised
For the most holy One.
The Third Part.
1
Take heed, ye Sinners, you don't quench
God's Word, that fire within;
Nor lesson not its burnings if
You would not die in sin.
2
If you will sin and have your Lusts,
Whatever Preachers say,
Then down to Hell be sure you must,
When Death takes you away.
3
Ah! there is another Fire know,
If this your filth don't waste,
Into Eternal Fire then you
Shall all be thrown at last.
4
Consider is it not better far
That sin consumed be,
Yea, all beloved sins and lusts,
Than damned eternally.
5
You that do find the work's begun,
That there is a spark of Fire
Kindled in your Souls, O let it burn,
And raise its flames up higher!
6
O it is, Soul know, a sacred spark,
It Is Fire all divine!
And God be sure has kindled it
In that poor Soul of thine.
The Fourth Part.
1
Consider God's design herein
Is to soften thy heart,
And to cement thy Soul to; him,
And Saving-grace impart:
2
And if it should be quenched in thee,
It lies not in thy power
To kindle it, and God in wrath
May also give thee over,
3
And never more renew that work,
But let thee quite alone,
In all thy sins to take thy swinge,
Until thy Soul is gone.
4
But ye who are the Saints of God,
As this is Fire divine;
So let Devils strive and do their worst,
It in thy Soul shall shine;
5
Though not always to such degree
Your sin it deaden may,
And therefore see you careful be
To cherish it each day;
6
And sing God's praise continually,
Who makes the Fire burn,
And pray that he would blow it up,
Till all your work is done;
7
And also cry unto the Lord
This Fire to kindle (...) about,
And sweetly burn in every place,
And never be put out.
HYMN 91.
Jer. 23. 29 Is not my Word like a Fire, and like a Hammer, to break the Rock
in pieces?
1
ROcks they are hard to work upon,
Yea, against a mighty Hand;
The hardest Flint or Pebble-stone
Whole, long it cannot stand.
2
If thou, O Lord, art pleased to take
The Hammer up and strike,
Thou will Impression quickly make,
Though none can do the like.
3
There Is none can break our flinty Rock
Besides thy self alone;
Alas, our power is too weak
To break such hearts of stone!
4
What can the Hammer do, O Lord,
Thou the great Agent art;
The Instrument, that is thy Word,
O smite upon the heart,
5
And make it yield! and square it then
For thy own b^^ss^d design;
Thy Image on it, Lord, cut out
Most holy and divine;
6
And fit it for thy building too,
O set it in its place,
And life infuse into it so
That it may shine with Grace.
The Second Part.
1
O let it be well polished,
And it also unite
Unto thy building, there to be
A Jasper-stone most bright,
2
That it may suit and well agree
With the Foundation-stone,
Which is of Gold, no Diamond
More glorious ever shone;
4
And then shall we, when thus we be
Into thy Building laid,
Have cause to sing unto our King
By thy eternal aid.
4
This Hammer of thy blessed Word
Must drive the Nail quite home,
Or else Convictions will not stick
Whenever they do come:
5
The Precept, Lord, will not abide,
Nor Promise fast'ned be;
Nor no Conviction last in us,
Until drove home by thee:
6
But since we find they fastened are,
Let us sing forth thy Praise;
And since thy Word so precious is,
Let us its Glory raise.
HYMN 92.
Hymns on the Divine, Authority of the Sacred Scriptures.
1
THe sacred Scriptures are sublime,
Although mysterious be;
Their Matter shows they are divine,
Nay, their divinity*
2
Is seen by what they do treat of,
Or unto us make known,
There we^^ read of great Jehovah,
The high and lofty One,
3
Of his dread Essence, nature pure,
And of the Unity
Between the Father, Son, and Spirit,
Or holy Trinity;
4
There do we read of his great works
Who did this World frame;
How out of nothing by his Word
All things at the first came.
5
There we may see and wonder too
How infinite Wisdom shone
I^ the glorious compact made between
The Father and the Son,
6
In finding out, and bringing in
A way for to unite
Justice and Mercy, that so they
Might equally shine bright.
7
Here Justice does with Mercy meet
Like an endeared Brother;
And Mercy does God's Justice greet,
And both do kiss each other.
8
From hence ye may see cause to sing
The Eternal One's high praise
(In bringing in of Jesus Christ)
With thankful hearts always.
The second Part.
1
The Antiquity of Scripture show
That they are most divine;
For no Writings did the World know
So soon as they did shine:
2
This was the first and chiefest Book
That e're was made or penned;
O therefore love in it to look,
Though you cannot comprehend
3
The Mysteries that lie therein
Hid from all carnal Eyes;
Yet since it has so ancient been,
O see these lines ye prize!
4
Their Royal descent from God alone
Also does plain appear
By their high Style and Majesty,
That shines in them most clear.
The Third Part.
1
The holiness which they promote
To such a high degree,
May clearly every Soul convince
Of their Authority:
2
So pure and perfect is God's Word
It silence may all them
Who it oppose, and Saints from hence
It love and much esteem. Ps. 119. 140.

3
This is the cause wherefore they love
God's Words better than Gold
Or Jewels rich, which are esteemed
By most who them behold.
4
They see God's Precepts are most just,
It does all sins descry,
And every Lust and false way they
Hate therefore bitterly.
5
The admirable and sweet consent,
And blessed harmony
That Is in the whole and every part
Shows their divinity.
6
The credit of their Penmen too,
Whom none could ever charge
With the least forgery or guile,
Does prove to us at large,
6
That they from God alone proceed,
Who did their Souls inspire
In writing all-they written have,
That Grace we might admire.
The Fourth Part.
1
Their Prophecies accomplished were,
(Which shows they are divine,)
Exactly as to time and thing,
To matter and design:
2
And the Miracles which were wrought
These VVritings do confirm,
Must needs also herein be brought,
To show from whence they came.
3
The preservation they have had
Was strange and mavelous,
And to their truth does glory add
For to be prized by us.
4
The great success with which they met
In midst of bitter Foes,
And how their power has prevailed,
Their lasting glory shows:
5
The World by a few Fishermen,
By this most sacred Word,
Without the help of carnal force,
Were turned to the Lord.
The Fifth Part.
1
The harmony and joint consent
Of holy Men and good,
And Martyrs who sealed to the Truth
Of them with their dear Blood,
2
Do show their great veracity,
And may all Men convince
They came from God, therefore we must
Bear up in their defense
3
Against all such who them oppose,
Or count them not divine;
For doubtless in all wise Men's sight
By these their glory shine.
4
The Evidence unto the heart
Which to good Men they give
Of God's great love, who does impart
To all who them receive
5
(In life and power) his Image clear:
Bringing the old Man down,
Renewing of their inward Man,
So that they cannot but own
6
The work which by this Word is wrought brought
On them to be divine;
Thus from these hints which we have
Gods Word does glorious shine.
7
The very Heathen witness bear
As to Matter of Fact,
Touching such things Scriptures declare
That God and Christ did act.
The Sixth Part.
1
Berolus, as Josephus shows,
Does mention Noah's Flood;
And Pliny, lib. 5. cap. 16. and Justin, lib. 36.
Pliny, with some others, speak
How the most mighty God
2
Did Sodom turn by dreadful Flames
Unto a dismal Lake:
Of Moses and his Wonders too
We find the Egyptians speak.
3
In their Records; yea, the Chaldeans
And Grecians own the same:
And others show with what high hand
Israel from Egypt came.
4
The Star which at Christ Jesus Birth
To the Wise Men did appear,
Pliny and Calcidius both
Most plain and full declare.
5
But there is no need of Man's Record,
To Men we do not fly;
The witness of the glorious Lord
Is full of certainty.
HYMN 93.
Joh. 10. 35. And the Scripures cannot be broken, etc.
1
THe Scripture broken cannot be,
Let Men think what they will,
Such, such is their veracity,
God will his Word fulfill.
2
Whatever thou, O Lord, have said,
Accomplished shall be;
No Promise past, nor Threat delayed,
No Soul shall ever see;
3
Because they are Divine we know,
Of such Authority,
That they from thee alone do flow,
Who will not, cannot lie.
4
Let Saints therefore rejoice and sing,
For they from hence may see
Great comfort unto them does spring
To all eternity;
5
For what thou have, Lord, promised
To such who do believe,
As it is contained in thy Word,
The same they shall receive:
6
But woe unto all wicked Ones,
Their doom appears hereby;
For if they live and die in sin,
In Hell they all must lie.
7
All praise to thee, O God, alone,
Whose Word we know shall stand;
Let all such sing who it believe,
And yield to thy command,
8
Who will do all, and do no more
Than written they do see,
These, these shall sing, and thee adore
Unto eternity.
HYMN 94.
Psalm. 119. 89. For ever, O Lord, thy Word is settled in Heaven.
1
IN Heaven, Lord, where thou do dwell
Thy VVord's established sure,
And shall to all eternity
Fast graven there endure.
2
From age to age thy Truth abides,
As does the Earth witness,
Whose Groundwork thou have laid so firm
No tongue can it express.
3
Go too therefore ye foolish Men,
Depart from me, Be gone;
For God's good Precepts we'll obey,
Nay, keep them every one.
4
What thou have promised, Lord, perform,
Till Death does seize on me;
Never let my hope abuse me so
As to distrust in thee.
5
Uphold me and I shall be safe
For ought they do or say,
And in thy Statutes pleasure take,
O Lord, both night and day.
6
Thou have trod such under thy feet
Who do thy Statutes break;
For naught avails their subtilty,
Their counsel is but weak.
HYMN 95.
Psalm. 119. 8, 9, 10, 11.
1
THy Covenants are very deep,
And full of things profound;
My Soul therefore thy Word will keep
When they are tried and found.
2
When Men enter into thy Word,
They find a Light most clear;
Though Fools, yet they, Lord, shall not err
When they to it adhere.
3
The Word of God most perfect is,
His Testimony sure;
Converting Souls, and making wise
The simple and obscure.
4
The Statutes of the Lord are right,
And fill the heart with joys;
The Precepts of the Lord are pure,
Enlightening the Eyes.
5
The Fear of God is clean also,
And does endure for ever;
The Judgments of the Lord are true,
And righteous altogether.
6
Yea, more than Gold, than much fine Gold
To be embraced always;
The Honey and the Honeycomb
Are not so sweet as they:
7
They are thy Servants Monitors,
How he his life should frame,
And great Rewards is there for them
Who do observe the same.
HYMN 96.
Joh. 5. 39. Search the Scriptures.
1
SEarch the Scripture, by which ye think
Eternal Life to have;
And those are they that testify
Of Him that came to save;
2
For what of old was given forth
Was for our learning penned,
That we by Scriptures comforted
Might hope unto the end.
3
The Prophecy came not of old
By Man's own private will,
But holy Men of God foretold
By Heaven's inspired skill:
4
Then to the Law and Testament
For they that speak not right,
And as this Word does represent,
In them there is no light:
5
For Scripture, sacred Verities
Came all by Inspiration,
Able to perfect and make wise,
Through Faith, unto Salvation.
HYMN 97.
The Excellency of the Gospel.
1
BLessed be God that we were born
Under the joyful sound,
And rightly have Baptized been,
And bred on English ground,
2
Where God most gracious does appear,
And does pour forth his Grace;
The lines are fallen unto us
In a most pleasant place.
3
''We might have been dark Pagans all,
''Or veiled like each Jew,
''Or cheated with an Alcoran
''Amongst the Turkish crew.
4
Dumb Pictures might we all adored,
Like Papists in Devotion;
And with Rome's Errors so been stored,
To drink her deadly Potion.
5
We might have lived in shades of night,
And never have known good days,
But thou have sent us Gospel Light
To thine eternal praise.
6
The Sun which rose up in the East,
And drove their shades away,
Has sent his Light unto the West,
And turned our Night to Day.
7
Blessed be God for what we see,
Our God for what we hear;
Sweet News of Heaven, Lord, from thee
Sounds daily in our Ear.
The End of the Fourth Part.
PART V. Containing SACRED HYMNS Setting out and illustrating the transcendent
Excellencies of the GRACES of the HOLY SPIRIT.
HYMN 98.
Mark 9. 50. Have Salt in your selves.
1
HOw unsavory, O Lord, are things,
Unless they salted be!
And so indeed were all our Souls,
Till seasoned by thee
2
With thy most sweet and precious Grace,
That is the Salt whereby
We sav'ry do become, O Lord,
Thy Salt, O then apply.
3
Salt is of such a quality
That it does search each part
Of Flesh, that it is laid upon,
So Grace searches the Heart:
4
The Spirit searches all deep things,
Yea, the deep things of God;
It will find out what sin in us
Does still make its abode;
5
And then (like Salt) does purge it out,
It Is Grace which purifies
The heart and life, there is no doubt
But such, like virtue, lies
6
In that most precious Grace of thine,
O then let us look and see
Whether we searched and purged are,
And then sing praise to thee.
The second Part.
1
Salt does preserve, it is evident,
Both Meat and other things,
Else they will corrupt and quickly taint;
Like Virtue also springs
2
From thy good Grace, it is that, O Lord,
Which does preserve from sin
All graceless Sinners odious stink,
So filt hy are within,
3
That all their inward parts corrupt,
And they like Carrion lie
In a vile Ditch, or Common-shore,
In their iniquity.
4
But such in whom Gods Grace is wrought,
Grace does their Souls preserve
From sin, in heart, in life, in thought,
Uprightly God to serve.
5
Most sweet are they and savoury
To God and unto Men,
And all their works they have performed
By Grace have seasoned been.
The Third Part.
1
Salt is of universal use,
There Is nothing Men want more;
Without God's Grace there is none can live,
Let them be rich or poor.
2
Such absolute need have we thereof,
Without it cannot live here
A holy life; nor can we stand
When Jesus does appear.
3
All ranks of Men both high and low,
Both Kings and Peasants too,
Must salted be with Grace on Earth,
Or down to Hell must go;
4
In every state, where-er'e they be,
By Sea as well as Land,
They Grace do need continually
If sin they would withstand:
5
Our speech, and all that we do say,
Must seasoned be with Salt;
Or else our words and breath will stink,
And all be good for naught.
The Fourth Part.
1
Salt, Naturalists do often declare,
Is good against the stings
Of Serpents; and does Worms destroy
Which from Corruption springs.
2
Grace is a sovereign remedy
Against the sting within;
And kills the Worm of Conscience too,
The product it is of sin:
3
Sin is a thing most venomous,
A sting it is likewise*
Of the old Serpent, and it is worse
Than what in Poison lies:
4
This kills the Soul and Body too,
And poisons every part;
And does corrupt each faculty
Of every Sinners heart.
5
Salt was of use under the Law;
For every Sacrifice
Must salted be, and so must we
Before All-seeing Eyes:
6
Yea, every Prayer and Offering
That Is offered up on high;
Your Duties all must seasoned be
With Grace continually.
7
But other Salt, if Meat do stink,
It cannot it sav'ry make,
But Grace will such recover who
Most filthy ways do take,
8
And in God's Nostrils loathsome are,
Yet Grace will sweeten them;
Nay, they will such a savor bear
He Will highly such esteem.
The Fifth Part.
1
But we, alas, do often see
Salt lose its savor may;
Or things may over-salted be,
If too much on they lay:
2
But Grace in both these things excells,
Its savor cannot lose;
Nor can we have of it too much,
Most savoury are all those
3
Who most are salted with this Salt,
O therefore loudly cry
For Grace good store, and do not fear,
God will your wants supply.
4
Then sing forth Praises to the Lord
With Grace in all your hearts,
And see that you well-season'd are
In all your inward parts.
HYMN 99.
Ephesians. 6. 14. And having your Loins girt about with Truth, etc.
1
TRue Grace, and true Sincerity
Is like a Girdle rare,
Which some about their Loins do love
Continually to wear.
2
Like as a Girdle cleaves to Men,
And does them compass in;
So Grace should cleave unto our Souls,
To keep us from all sin.
3
We in the bonds of Truth and Grace
Should evermore abide,
And never from God's Grace and Truth
Go back, nor turn aside.
4
And as a Girdle strengthens
The Loins of every one,
So will this Girdle of Truth also
All such who have it on.
5
If you in the true Doctrine are,
And in sincerity
Do firmly stand in every Truth,
Small weakness you will espy
6
To be in you, for strength you will have,
If that your hearts be ^ound;
And every Gospel blessed Truth
Be evermore your bound.
The Second Part.
1
The Soldier in the days of old
His Armor did gird on,
And then completely harnessed
Was he to look upon:
2
So must the Christians Armor be
Girt with sincerity,
What will Men's Faith, or Righteousness,
Or Hope else signify,
3
If they are not upright in heart,
And Truth is not their bound,
They Hypocrites be sure will then
(If so) at last be found
4
To have the Loins well girt, denotes
That Preparation we
Unto the Battle ought to make,
So ready must we be
5
For to encounter or engage
With all our cruel Foes,
To have our Armor girt with Truth,
And then need fear no blows.
The Third Part.
1
Girdling also service denotes,
Let Loins be girt about;
And let your Lights be shining too,
And let them not go out;
2
That ye may on your Master wait,
Whose coming does draw near;
Be ready therefore every Saint,
O now your selves prepare!
3
Let every thing in truth be done,
And Grace the Girdle be;
And then with joy shall every one
Their blessed Master see.
4
A Girdle is an Ornament,
It fastens all together,
And covers Joints the Armor has
That Men cannot tell whether
5
It Is all one piece, or it is in parts,
It does them so unite;
Thus does Uprightness us adorn,
That in Jehovah's sight
6
There seems no flaw, nor no defects,
Uprightness covers all;
God does that Soul who is sincere,
A perfect Christian call.
The Fourth Part.
1
Come, art thou low, of mean descent,
And of ignoble birth?
Grace covers this deformity,
Its glory so shines forth:
2
Or art thou lame, or outwardly
May blemishes be seen?
Yet Grace does cover this defect,
Thy Beauty's great within:
3
Or art thou poor, and so art brought
Unto contempt and scorn?
Sincerity does make thee rich,
Nay more, to be high born.
4
May be thy parts and gifts are small,
And hence Men thee despise?
Sincerity hides this in all,
In this thy Glory lies;
5
For Grace excells the greatest Gifts,
Gifts may to Man commend;
But Grace commends thee now to God,
And so 'twill in the end.
The Fifth Part.
1
Soul, have thou worse defects than these,
Infirmities within?
Sincerity does God so please,
It covers all thy sin.
2
He it esteems so as if thou
Had never broke his Law,
And through Christ's Righteousness he does
In thee behold no flaw.
3
O get this Girdle on, ye Saints,
It glitters more than Gold;
It never can besides be lost,
And does its Beauty hold
4
As fresh as 'twas when first put on,
O blessed Sincerity!
How glorious art thou! how do thou
Shine in Jehovah's Eye!
5
See then that ye the Truth hold fast,
And with it girted be;
Then no delusion needst thou fear,
Nor cursed Heresy;
6
But the right Girdle take be sure,
And not the counterfeit,
The true by this you may descry,
Christ's Truth is stamped on it.
7
It with the written Word agrees
Exact in every thing;
If all Christ's Precepts you don't own,
Contempt on you 'twill bring.
8
That Girdle will not hold but break,
Though you may seem sincere
So far as you cleave unto Truth,
Yet will at last appear
9
A false Professor, 'cause you have
Some blessed Truth withstood,
Into which you did Light receive,
But not obey it would.
The Sixth Part, with Psalm. 117.
1
Each Truth of God, O it is pure,
God's Truth does make us clean;
It frees our Souls also for ever,
Such glory in it is seen. John 8

2
Strong is the Truth you all will say,
This Girdle then is strong;
O buy it, Souls, whilst it is to day,
'Twill fit both old and young.
3
God's Saints did suffer grievous pain,
Great tortures did endure
Before they would part with the Truth,
Such peace it did procure
4
Unto their Souls who faithful were
Unto the Truth always;
O it will make you holy, bold
In the great Judgment-day.
5
Now let all Nations of the Earth
Their great Creator praise;
Nay let the people all sing forth
His mighty Name to raise;
6
Whose Kindness's great unto his Saints,
His Mercies ever sure;
O praise ye him for his blessed Truth
Which does abide for ever!
HYMN 100.
Ephesians. 6. 14. And having on the Breastplate of Righteousness, etc.
1
O Lord, we Soldiers are, and we
Must fight, or else be slain;
O let us all well armed be,
For Foes come on amain!
2
And since our Enemies do aim
To hit us on the Breast,
Thy blessed Breast Plate let us have on,
For that will hold the rest.
3
It Is righteousness that will secure
Our Souls from every wrong,
And 'twill also, O Lord, endure
As well as it is strong.
4
There Is no engaging in these Wars
Without a Righteousness;
This Breast Plate scatters all our fears,
Who do thy Name profess.
5
A Breast Plate it is that does preserve
The Body's chiefest part;
It Is Righteousness which, Lord, does save
Our precious Souls and Heart.
The Second Part.
1
A Breast Plate does the Soldier cheer,
It makes him very bold;
So Righteousness does make us all
Our Sword with courage hold,
2
And not to fear in the day of evil
What any man can do;
Nay we hereby withstand the Devil,
Who does great malice show.
3
O then, ye Saints, see you maintain
A good and holy life,
And soon thereby you will obtain
An end of all that strife
4
With which you meet from Foes without,
And also from within;
O know it is God's great design
To purge you from your sin;
5
And that you holy should all live,
And hence it is you have Grace;
The Seed of Holiness is sown,
And it will grow apace,
6
If under God's shinings ye sit,
And he his Rain does send,
Then will your Righteousness break forth,
And peace will flow in the end;
7
And of God's Goodness ye shall sing,
And lift your voice on high,
And happy be when God does bring
You on Deathbeds to lie.
HYMN 101.
Ephesians. 6. 16. Above all things take the shield of Faith.
1
FAith is a Grace that God has wrought
In us who do believe;
If it be strong, we need not care
What Gun-shots we receive
2
From Satan, who his fiery Darts
Continually lets fly;
Ah! it is our Shield to save all parts,
Whatever danger's nigh.
3
A Shield is turned every way,
That so no Dart may wound;
And we by Faith, as with a Shield,
Are compassed quite round.
4
The Will and Judgment it secures,
And does Affections keep
Warm unto Christ, and Conscience too,
It saves from drousie sleep.
5
A Shield preserves the other part
Of Armor we have on;
So Faith secures every Grace;
That hurt be done to none.
6
Christ's Righteousness is very pure,
To that it is we must flee;
And unto us by Faith it is sure,
And this by Faith we see.
HYMN 102.
1 Pet. 1. 7 That the trial of your Faith, which is much more precious than
Gold, etc.
1
BY Faith we do on Christ depend
For all that he has done;
By Faith we do to God ascend
With many a bitter groan:
2
And we receive what we do want,
When we by Faith do cry;
Faith does sustain each drooping Saint,
And all their needs supply.
3
Gold is a thing that has the Name
Of things that precious are;
For Preciousness Faith has the same,
With which Gold cannot compare.
4
Though Gold is precious when it is tried,
Yet tried Faith exceeds
The finest Gold, it is more in worth,
And does supply all needs:
5
It Is more desirable far than Gold,
O with it fall in love!
And as hid Treasure seek it do
Of God, through Christ above.
6
Gold by the Touchstone must be tried,
So you must try your Faith;
No Touchstone but God's blessed Word
Is there in all the Earth.
HYMN 103.
1 Thessalonians. 5. 8. And for an Helmet the Hope of Salvation:
1
HOpe is a precious Grace, O Lord;
And fixed it must be
Upon thy self most patiently,
No other Hope have we.
2
It Is not on Gold, nor length of days,
Nor on things here below;
But it is on Jesus Christ alone,
From whence all Help does flow:
3
And like a Helmet it is we find
That does preserve the Head;
Hope stays on thee, always our mind,
When we are hard bested;
4
And as a Helmet fearless makes
A Soldier in the Field;
So hope of glory makes us all
Resolve we never will yield
5
To Satan, nor to other Foes,
When we with them do meet;
Nor need we fear their cruel blows,
If we have this Helmet,
6
Since we completely armed are,
Even from head to foot,
^ur headpiece makes us to appear
Both fierce and very stout.
7
This Helmet will us never sail
If that we have it on;
^he Soul it is, it does preserve
Till all our dangers gone.
HYMN 104.
Heb. 6. 19. Which Hope we have as the Anchor of the Soul.
1
THis World's a Sea, our Soul's a Ship
With raging Tempest tossed;
And if she should her Anchor slip,
She doubtless will be lost.
2
Thou, Lord, our skilful Pilot art,
Thou know all Rocks and Sands;
Our Seamen are our Faculties,
Which must do thy commands.
3
Faith like a Cable does appear,
Hope is our Anchor sure;
And if right cast, we need not fear
We shall each Storm endure.
4
Repentance like a Bucket is
To pump the water out;
For leaky is our Ship, alas,
Which makes us look about.
5
Thy Graces are our blessed Freight,
And Heaven is our Port;
Thy Spirit, Lord, must fill our Sails
If e're we bid fair for it.
The Second Part.
1
Lord, still the Seas, alas, they swell,
And very tempestuous are;
Our Compass is thy Holy Word,
By that it is we must steer.
2
Lord, thou have power over the Seas,
Let us not calmed be;
And when the Waves do roar and swell,
Let Us cast our Hope in thee.,
3
Which like an Anchor does take hold
With that within the Veil;
And if right cast, we may be bold,
Our courage shall not fail.
4
We for our Anchor have a Rock
That is most firm and sure,
And thou will us, Lord, never deceive,
But will our Souls secure.
5
Let Hope be fixed on Christ our Lord,
And on thy Covenant;
Thy Promises also afford
Relief to every Saint.
6
Christ's Death and Resurrection too
Our Hope is grounded on;
If thus we cast our Anchor do,
We safe are every one.
HYMN 105.
Cant. 8. 6. Love is strong as Death, Jealousy as cruel as the Grave, the
Coals thereof are, as Coals of Fire, etc.
1
O Set thine Image on my Heart!
O seal it on my Arm!
For Love, like Death, does cast its Dart,
And Jealousy is warm.
2
It Is like the Grave, whose keen desire
Nothing can satisfy;
The Coals thereof ate Coals of Fire
That flame most vehemently.
3
Waters cannot quench Love's Flames, nor Floods
The same can ever drown;
If some for Love would give his Goods,
Despised is such an one.
4
Lord, bear our Name upon thy Breast,
Engrave it on thy Heart,
There let it be so sure possessed
It thence may never depart;
5
For Love we find is very strong,
It wounds unto the quick;
Thy presence, Lord, supports our Souls,
Thy absence makes us sick.
6
Should thou but seemingly disdain
Our Souls that are engaged,
Like Fire it would put us to pain,
Whose grief's not soon asswag'd.
The Second Part.
1
O love us then, or else we die;
Is it not thee we crave?
If thou thy Love should once deny,
We soon should find a Grave.
2
Death conquers all, and all submit
Unto his pale command;
So Love brings all unto its seet
Who are therewith inflamed.
3
The Grave is never satisfied,
No more, alas, can he
Who having tasted of thy Love,
Till he enjoys thee.
4
But Death destroys and also kills,
But Love does make alive;
It kills our sin, and we thereby
Do presently revive:
5
But if the Object be denied
The Heart is set upon,
We never can be satisfied
Until our life is gone.
6
Love so does flame, and Jealousy
So burns the Heart and Eyes;
The Soul must be embraced by thee,
Or be Love's Sacrifice.
7
Whole Seas of trouble cannot quench
Love's everlasting flame;
Let what will come where true Love is,
That Soul is still the same.
HYMN 106.
Col. 2. 12. Buried with him in Baptism.
1
LOrd, are we dead? dead unto sin?
Then buried let us be;
Let sin be covered, the old Man
Be slain, O Lord, by thee.
2
We have Baptized been, O Lord,
As such who were all dead,
To show that thou did lie in the Grave,
We all were buried
3
Under the water, whereby we
Do in a figure see,
That as we showed how we are dead,
So raised are with thee.
4
None buried are till dead they be,
Those who baptized are
Ought to be dead to every sin,
To self, and all things here.
5
Those who are buried, covered are
All over in the Earth;
In Baptism the self-same thing
Must plain be holden forth:
6
Or else it answers not the end
Of Christ, who did ordain
That glorious Rite, if not so done,
They do the same profane.
HYMN 107.
Heb. 6. 1, 2. Not laying again the Foundation of Repentance from dead Works,
and of Faith toward God, ver. 1. Of the Doctrine of Baptism, and laying on of
Hands, etc. ver. 2.
1
REpentance, when wrought in the Soul,
And Faith for to believe,
Then such on Jesus Christ rely,
And truly him receive
2
As their dread Lord and Sovereign
Him always to obey,
And in all things over them to reign,
And govern night and day.
3
Christ's Baptism is very sweet,
With laying on of Hands,
Our Souls are brought to Jesus's Feet
In owning his Commands.
4
Those Ordinances Men oppose,
And count as carnal things;
We have closed with, and tell to those,
From them great comfort springs.
5
Thee, holy Lord, we must obey,
Though Men reproach us still;
Yet let us do what thou do say,
And yield unto thy Will;
6
And still alone on thee rely,
And not on what-we do;
In point of trust we fly to thee,
And let our own works go;
7
And though in minding thy sweet truth
Men do us vilify,
Yet we resolve, Lord, in thy strength,
To own them till we die.
The Second Part.
1
O Lord, let us not turn our back
On thee whom we do love;
For we do know we shall not lack
Thy presence from above;
2
For thou have promised to the end
To us that will be near,
And be to us a faithful Friend,
Which makes us not to fear
3
Whatever Men or Devils do
In secret place design;
For soon can thou them overthrow,
And help all Souls of thine.
4
The Resurrection of the Dead
We constantly maintain,
When all those who lie buried
Shall rise to life again;
5
And that the Judgment-day will come,
When Christ upon the Throne
Shall pass a black eternal doom
Upon each wicked one:
6
But all his Saints then joyfully
With bowels he will embrace,
And Crowns to all eternity
Upon their Heads he will place;
7
And in the Kingdom shall they reign
Prepared long before,
And also shall with Christ remain
In bliss for evermore.
HYMN 108.
1 Cor. 5. 7. For Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us.
1
O Blessed Lamb of God, shall I
Forget that love of thine!
Thy life, O Lord, thou did give up
To save this Soul of mine.
2
Most harmless Lamb, and innocent,
When come to a ripe age,
Ah! then did thou thy life give up
God's anger to assuage.
3
Thy Blood is sprinkled on our Doors,
Or rather on our Hearts,
To show God has our sins passed over,
And Mercies he imparts.
5
The Lamb it was roasted with fire,
Thou did God's wrath sustain;
And on thee we by Faith do feed,
And life thereby obtain.
5
The Lamb was eat with bitter Herbs,
So let us see our sin,
And find it bitter unto us,
It so to thee has been;
6
And so let us thy Praises sing
Whilst thus we feast with thee,
And with one heart exalt our King
In all sincerity.
PART VI. Containing diverse SACRED HYMNS, Setting forth The Nature, Work,
Office, and Excellencies of the holy Angels, and the Spirit or Soul of Man.
HYMN 109.
Dan. 4. 17. This matter is by the decree of the Watchers.
THe holy Angels have a charge
To watch continually;
They do not sleep, but evermore
Have us in their sweet eye.
2
They have a charge to keep us here,
And compass us about,
And warning give oft-times also
When trouble's breaking out.
3
Watchmen are useful in the night,
They dangers do prevent;
So Angels useful are to those
Unto whom they are sent.
4
Was not Elisha safe whilst he
Was compassed quite round
With these blessed Chariots and Horsemen
Who did his Foes confound?
5
O what are we, most holy God,
That thou should take such care
Of us who so unworthy be,
And sinful Creatures are!
The Second Part.
1
Behold the Angels of the Lord
Do encompass round about
All them that fear him, for their Guard,
To keep all dangers out;
2
For he has given his Angels charge
To keep thee day by day,
That thou may walk abroad at large
With safety in thy way;
3
For they this charge must execute,
And bear thee in their Arms,
Lest ever thou should dash thy feet
Against a stone for harm;
4
For are they not all Ministers
Sent forth for ministration
In their behalf, that shall be Heirs
Of God's assured Salvation?
5
Ye Saints, behold the Love of God,
And sing his Praises forth;
No wicked Prince has such a Guard
As the meanest Saint on Earth.
HYMN 110.
Job 38. 7. When the Morning-stars sang together, etc.
HOw glorious are the Morning-Stars!
How does their glory shine!
Angels most glorious Creatures are,
Yea, holy and divine:
They sang together at the first
Jehovah's glorious praise,
And we of them also learn must
To sing to God always.;
Nay, with united voices sing
In Consort with much joy,
^ince Christ has overcome our Foes,
Who would our Souls destroy:
4
And did they not a second time
Sing unto God on high,
When Jesus Christ our Lord was born?
And yet shall Saints deny
5
This is our work? No, no, it does
Sharply indeed reprove
Such who would rob the holy God
Of that which he does love.
6
It is his due, and it belongs
To him as his just Right;
His Praise to celebrate in Songs
Is lovely in his sight.
Psalm 89.
7
Thy Mercies, Lord, then we will sing
Thy Truth to all proclaim;
The heavenly Angels sacred Choir
Shall celebrate the same.
8
These never with the Lord dispute,
Nor his Commands contest,
But give attendance at his Throne,
With awful fear possessed.
HYMN 111.
Job 38. 8. And all the Sons of God shouted for joy.
1
SOns in their Father do rejoice,
Whose Offspring all they be,
And hence the Angels lift their voice
In Songs, Lord, unto thee,
2
By whom they all created were,
And on whom they attend,
And from whom all their dignity
Does unto them descend:
3
They clothed are like unto Sons
With might and glorious power,
And serve the Lord most willingly,
With greatest zeal each hour:
4
One part of their sweet work's to sing
To God melodiously,
And we by them also are taught
To sing continually.
5
Then as God's will is done by them,
Let us do it on Earth;
Like flames of fire let us be,
And sing God's Praises forth.
HYMN 112.
Genesis 32. 1. This is God's Host, etc.
1
THe glorious God, the Lord above,
Has a most mighty Host,
Who have a Prince their General,
Of whom they daily boast:
2
Christ is their Head, he is Head of all
Princ'palities and Powrs,
And these do keep and save the Saints
From him that Souls devours.
3
This mighty Host and Army's raised
Under their Prince to fight,
And one of them has thousands slain
Of Rebels in a night.
4
This Host sometimes does suddenly
Vile Sinners so invade
By Plague and Famine, and by War,
That all are soon dismayed.
5
They slaughtering Weapons have each one
And Execution do;
And as Commission they receive,
They save, or do o'nethrow.
HYMN 113.
Ezekiel 1. 6, 10. And every one had four Faces, the Face of a Man, of a Lion, of
an Ox, and of an Eagle.
1
THe Face of a Man has majesty,
And shows a Soul does dwell
In him that has rare faculties,
In knowledge does excel:
2
So Angels look with awful frowns
When they in wrath appear,
And are endu'd with wisdom great
Beyond what Mortals are.
3
The Face of a Man also denotes
What beauty is in them,
Who are most glorious in themselves,
And so in our esteem.
4
Face of a Lion shows their strength,
A Lion is so strong
That he will turn away from none,
Nor fears he any wrong.
5
Face of an Ox may signify
How painful they all be,
And any service patiently
Perform, O Lord, for thee.
6
An Eagle has a piercing Eye,
And swift she is in flight;
The Angels do God's Face behold,
And fly with greatest might.
HYMN 114.
Psalm. 104. 4. He makes his Angels Spirits, and his Ministers a flaming Fire.
1
ANgels as swift as Air, as bright
As Flames, with quick obedience move,
To publish and effect below
That charge given to them above.
2
As Fire burns and does consume,
So the Seraphims signify
A burning to show what zeal's in them
Who do attend on God most high:
3
And also how with flaming zeal,
When they from God Commission have,
They do break forth at his dread Word
To kill his Foes, his Saints to save.
4
Let wicked ones amazed stand,
Who can escape a flaming Fire;
Let Saints also do God's Command
With zeal, like to the heavenly Quire:
5
And let them learn likewise from hence
What comfort this to them may bring;
These Angels come for your defense
Swift, like to Flames, or Eagles Wings.
HYMN 115.
Zach. 1. 8. Behold a Man upon a red Horse, and behind him were red Horses,
speckled, and white.
1
A Horse is strong, and nothing fears,
And swift they are to run,
Angels are clothed with mighty strength,
And fly like to the Sun.
2
Horses and Chariots of Fire do
Show how fierce and agil
The glorious Angels are always
In doing of God's Will.
3
By Horses red thou do, Lord show
Those dreadful slaughters they
Do make of Men, when thou bids them
Ezekiel. 9. 2, 4.
Go forth with Swords and slay.
4
By speckled Horses thou make known
A mixed Dispensation,
When Mercy mingled is with Wrath
In any sinful Nation.
5
The white Horses notes that sweet peace
Which thou at last will send;
For Wars on Earth thou will make cease
Before the World end:
6
And that in Christ's dread Government
He Angels often does use;
And they are often also sent
To show what next ensues.
HYMN 116.
Prove. 20. 27. The Spirit of a Man is the Candle of the Lord, etc.
1
ONce was our Candle lighted, Lord,
And did most clearly burn;
But soon did Satan blow it out,
And we were all undone:
2
Left in the darkness of the night,
And were bewildered so,
That we for want of thy sweet light
Knew not which way to go.
3
O let our Candle lighted be!
O light it once again,
And by it search to find out sin
Which may in us remain.
4
It Is thou must light our Candle, Lord,
With the Fire of thy Grace;
O let it burn and never go out
Till we have run our race;
5
That in thy sight we may see light,
And thereby may rejoice,
And sing thy Praises day and night
With heart and cheerful voice.
HYMN 117.
Romans 9. 1. My Conscience bearing witness in the Holy Ghost, etc.
1
COnscience a Witness is, O Lord,
Of all we do and say,
And such who sin against their Light,
He will the matter lay
2
Before the Soul, because he knows
The Thoughts of each Man's Heart,
And never will be bribed by them,
Nor from his Charge depart.
3
How careful should each Person be
They do not him offend;
For if God's Word does side with him,
It will appear in the end;
4
The Soul as Guilty will be found,
And Cast too shall such be,
And by the Judge Condemned also
To all eternity;
5
Then woe to such who treach'rously
Their Conscience do abuse,
Or stifle him whom God thinks good
In this great Case to use
6
Even as a Witness for himself
In every Man's own Heart,
To Evidence to Matter of Fact,
And Judgment to impart,
7
As God's true Witness, for to clear
Him who would judge aright,
And make it also to appear
So in each Man's own sight.
The Second Part.
1
Then look to it, ye Sinners, who
Your Conscience stifle now;
For he against you will be called
One day, and make you bow;
2
And though you think to silence him,
So that he cannot speak,
Yet in the Judgment-day he will rouse,
And make your hearts to ache.
3
If you live not up to your Light,
Then fear what will ensue;
For when he does receive more sight,
He quickly will renew
4
His dread Commission from the Lord,
And you condemned shall be;
If he accuses by God's Word,
No help there is for thee,
5
Unless thou do leave off thy sin,
To end the bitter strife,
He Will make thee quickly to cry out,
As weary of thy life.
6
But O how happy is the Man
That Conscience by God's Word
Does quite discharge from guilt of sin
In sight of the blessed Lord!
7
From this great Witness none can fly,
He will also appear
At the last day, and will accuse,
Or otherwise will clear.
HYMN 118.
The Third Part.
Sing this as the Hundredth Psalm.
1
IF Conscience is become my Friend,
And cheerfully does speak to me,
And I do to his motions bend,
No matter though I hated be:
2
No matter it is who does revile,
If Conscience does his witness bear
For us, and does upon us smile,
Most easy will all things appear.
3
If Conscience now does give us rest,
And from all burdens sets us free,
Again we would not be oppressed
In the old bonds of misery,
4
For Kingdoms, nor for Crowns of Gold,
Such inward joy does he afford,
That nothing can the lame unfold,
It so abounds in the Lord.
5
It Is Conscience which with peecious Food
Does feed God's Saints continually;
Its Dainties also are so good,
All other Sweets they do defy.
6
This Banquet lasting is also,
It Is here they feast both night and day,
With all supplies they meet with do,
And none their joys can take away.
7
It Is Conscience which does cheerful make
When Saints possessed are with grief;
And when they suffer for his sake,
He brings them joy and sweet relief.
The Fourth Part.
1
When Troubles rise and do increase,
And Sinners to the Mountains fly,
Conscience to Saints does speak much peace,
And makes them sing when they do die.
2
When others do amazed stand,
A place of shelter, Lord, have we,
And Conscience will lend us a hand,
That we may hide our selves in thee;
3
And in safe Chambers lock us up
Whilst all the Troubles here shall last,
And free us from the bitter cup
'Till all the indignation's past.
4
At Death, and in the Judgment-day,
What would Men give for such a Friend?
All those which do him disobey,
They Will find themselves undone it' the end.
5
How will such Souls repent too late,
And woefully will howl and cry!
But whilst such do condole their sat,
Our Souls shall sing continually
6
In joyful Hymns unto our God,
Who has preserved us from harms,
And ever will protect us still
From Satan's base alluring Charms.
The End of the Sixth Part.
PART VII. Containing several SACRED HYMNS, Setting forth. The Glory of God's
CHURCH: Likewise Of Afflictions, the Day of Grace; And of the four last things,
viz. Death and Judgment, Heaven and Hell.
HYMN 119.
Psalm. 87. 3. Glorious things are spoken of thee, O City of God.
GLorious things are spread abroad
Of Sion, far and near,
That blessed City of our God,
Whose beauty is most rare:
2
There is a quiet stream makes glad
The City of the Lord;
His presence will secure her peace,
And timely help afford.
3
Her Building is of Precious-stone,
Her Foundation's sure;
No Jasper ever has so shone
Like it, it is so pure.
4
It Is God who did this City raise,
And he will it repair,
That it may be to his high praise,
Himself also dwells there:
5
It is his Dewlling Place below,
The Palace of our King;
And all great Kings shall Gifts bestow,
To make her glory ring
6
Throughout the Earth, to such degree
Shall she her beauty spread;
Her glory shall by great and small
Be much admired.
7
Then sing, ye Saints, lift up your voice,
Who do in Sion dwell;
What People like unto you are,
O happy Israel!
HYMN 120.
Isa. 5. 1. Now will I sing to my Wellbeloved a Song of my Beloved, touching
his Vineyard, etc.
1
NOw even will I sing a Song
To my Beloved dear,
A Song of his own Vineyard it is
Which he has planted here.
2
My Beloved he a Vineyard has
In a most fruitful Hill,
And he also fenced it about
With care and greatest skill:
3
He planted it with the choice Vine,
And built a Tower too,
Where he does dwell, who is divine,
This does its glory show.
4
A Wine Press too he made therein,
Which Wine pours forth amain,
Of which he does delight to drink,
Due glory to obtain.
5
'Twas to this end he took such pains,
And such great cost laid out;
'Twas for his praise, and for our good
'Twas planted without doubt.
6
He gathered also out the stones
Which did the same annoy,
And did preserve it every day,
That none might it destroy.
The Second Part.
1
And then he looked it should bring
Forth Grapes both sweet and good,
But ah! it was a grievous thing
If rightly understood,
2
That after all his cost and pains
It should wild Grapes bring forth,
When no Vineyard was like to it
Planted in all the Earth.
3
But hark now what the Lord does say,
The Hedge I Will take away,
And also waste I will it lay
To evil Beasts of prey;
4
For what, alas, could he do more
For it than he has done!
And does it still wild Grapes bring forth?
This made his wrath to burn
5
Within his Breast, and therefore did
Resolve for to restrain
The precious Clouds that watered it
With sweet and blessed Rain:
6
Or make his Ministers who preach
His good and holy Word,
Useless to it, so that they might
To it no good afford.
7
O then, ye Saints take heed and fear
Lest you should barren prove;
For if you do, God may from you
His presence quite remove:
8
But if that you who are his Church
Bring forth the Fruit of Grace,
He never will deal with you thus,
Your glory to deface.
HYMN 121.
1 Cor. 10. 15. All baptized into one Body. Col. 1. 18. He is the Head of the
Body, the Church.
1
Every natural Body has
A Head, and has but one;
The Head, Lord, of thy Church thou art,
Thou art her Head alone.
2
And all her Members joined be
To thee in sacred bonds,
And influence they have from thee,
In thee her glory stands.
3
(...) all Members of the Body are
Of use unto the whole,
So of some use unto thy Church
Is every gracious Soul
4
Who is a Member of the same;
If any rotten are,
And past all hope of being healed,
No being must have there,
5
But off they must be cut with speed,
Lest worser dangers fall;
For one polluted Member may
Even soon corrupt them all.
The Second Part.
1
Woe unto him who shall attempt
This Body to divide,
Or make a Schism, it is all one,
With piercing of Christ's side;
2
For O the nearness that is between
The Body and the Head,
Don't cut Christ's Veins, remember well
What once he suffered.
3
O wound him not again, I say,
His Body don't annoy;
If it you mangle, he will you
For evermore destroy:
4
But see that every one does seek
To do good to each other,
And pity take continually
Of the poorest Brother.
5
O live in love, and see how near
You to each other are,
And equally your Duties do,
And nothing do you fear.
HYMN 122.
Exodus 3. 2. And the Angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of Fire out
of the midst of a Bush.
1
THy Church, Lord, in her self is poor,
Like to a Bramble dry;
It Is, Lord, in thee, in thee alone
Does all her glory lie.
2
But though a Bush, yet in it thou
Do dwell for evermore,
And therefore she is not consumed
Even now as heretosore.
3
This Bush long time on fire has been,
O it is a wondrous sight,
Though in the fire, yet not burned,
This may our Souls invite:
4
To take a view, as Moses did,
O why is* this thing so?
Alas, thy Church is dear to thee,
Beyond all things below!
5
O then let all those precious Birds
Who in this Bush are hid,
Sing forth thy praise continually,
And none their Souls forbid.
6
The time of singing, O it is come,
Since the sweet Turtle-Dove
Did let us hear, in this our Land,
His voice from Heaven above.
HYMN 123.
Rev. 1. 20. The Golden Candle-sticks are the seven Churches.
1
THy Churches, Lord, are like unto
Rich Candle-sticks of Gold,
In whom shines forth that glorious light
Which Sinners do behold.
2
Those Candlesticks which are so rich
Are seldom to be found
But in the House of a great Prince,
Whose glory is renowned.
3
This shows the Churches of the Saints
Do, Lord, belong to thee,
Who art the glorious King of Kings,
They useful also be,
4
As Candlesticks in a large House,
In which the Light they place;
And also are for Ornament
Even thus, through thine own Grace,
5
Are all thy Churches here on Earth
Of use, Lord, unto thee,
And unto others, who likewise
Thy Riches in them see.
6
Thy Candlesticks then don't remove,
But let their Light so shine,
That all the Earth may lighted be
Into all Truths of thine.
HYMN 124.
Luke 12. 32. Fear not little Flock, etc.
1
THy Church is like a Flock of Sheep,
Whose number is but small,
Which thou thy self do always keep,
And wilt preserve them all.
2
Thy Saints, like Sheep, are innocent,
Most harmless, also meek;
If any of them go astray,
It Is thou who do them seek.
3
Thou also do them feed and lead
In Pastures flourishing,
And have for them a resting place,
Besides the Water-spring.
4
They subject are for to get Soil,
But thou do wash them in
The Fountain of thy precious Blood,
From every stain of sin.
5
As Sheep are fruitful, so thy Church
And Children are, O Lord;
They honor bring to thee, and then
To Men profit afford.
6
Fear not, ye Saints, though Wolves abound,
And other Beasts of prey;
For Christ will keep you safe and sound
Unto the Judgment-day:
7
And you the Kingdom shall receive,
Rejoice and sing therefore;
Keep close to Christ, and mind the Flock
Which followed him before.
HYMN 125.
Job 25. 6. The Son of Man a Worm.
1
AH! what mean and despised things
Are Worms that crawl on Earth!
Man is a Worm, he from Earth sprung,
From thence were we brought forth.
2
No, beauty in a sorry Worm,
Man's glory that is gone,
Contemptible is in thy sight,
Each vile and wicked one.
3
What can a Worm do to preserve
It self from hurt or wrong,
That is in danger by each foot?
So we are all day long.
4
We cannot preserve our selves one day,
Our Life is but a blast;
And one small sin, if not purged out,
May damn the Soul at last.
5
Then do not pride it in your selves,
You to the Worms must go;
For all your beauty soon will fly,
You must corruption know.
HYMN 126.
Job 14. 2. He flees also as a shadow, and abides not.
1
ON Earth our days will be but few,
Like as the shadow flies;
Or like unto the Morning-Dew,
Does pass when Sun does rise;
2
So do our Days, our Months, and Years,
Make haste to fly away,
Much like the Blossom he appears,
Which quickly does decay:
3
Or like the Flower in the Spring,
Whose beauty's very rare;
And as the Birds in Summer sing,
We may our selves compare.
4
The glory of the Flowers fail,
The Summer ends also;
The Birds do then themselves bewail,
And know not what to do.
5
The Blossom withers soon away,
Like Jonah's Gourd it is gone;
So we sprout up, and shall not stay,
Our lives will soon be done.
HYMN 127.
Romans 8. 17. If Children, then Heirs.
1
IF we are Children of the Lord
By being born again,
Then are we also Heirs with Christ,
And with him we shall reign.
2
He that is an Heir to a great King,
He is a Prince by birth;
And so is each true Child of God,
The holy Scripture says.
3
The Heir shall the Inheritance
At last Possession have,
And so shall all Believers too
The Crown at last receive.
4
But as the Heir must wait awhile
Until he comes to age,
So must we all with patience wait
Till we have run our stage.
5
The Heir is likely richly clothed,
Whereby it is he is known;
So all God's Saints with holiness
Are clothed every one.
6
The Heir, as the Birthright of old,
The Blessing had always;
So all the Saints chief Blessings have,
And therefore sing God's praise.
HYMN 128.
1 Cor. 9. So run that ye may obtain.
1
HE that the Prize does think to have,
Must take the greatest care
To set out timely, must begin
Before old age draws near.
2
He that would win the Prize also,
Must know what way to run;
And must hold out, not weary be,
Until the Prize he is won.
3
All weights he must cast off with speed,
And temperate also be,
Or else he will saint, and never will
God's blessed Kingdom see.
4
Such who do run a race, sometimes
Have many Lookers on;
Both Men and Angels view the Saints,
And mind how they do run.
5
They who do run an earthly Race,
Run for some earthly thing;
But every Saint that gains the Prize,
Shall Crowned be as a King.
6
O then, ye Saints, run you apace
In ways of Piety;
Gird up your Loins, and nothing fear,
Look up, lift up your Eye
7
The Prize to see: Ah! it is your own,
And when you end your days,
You shall receive it, therefore now
Break forth and sing God's praise.
HYMN 129.
Heb. 11. 13. They confessed they were Strangers and Pilgrims on the Earth.
1
LOrd, we are Pilgrims on the Earth,
As all our Fathers were;
For this is not our dewlling place,
No 'biding for us here.
2
As Pilgrims go up hill and down,
And meet with troubles do;
So, Lord, thy Saints, while they are here,
Do many sorrows know.
3
A Pilgrim is a Stranger in
Those places where he lies,
And therefore is not taken with
Those things which he espyes,
4
Or does behold where he does come:
What are these things to me?
Says a poor Saint; I must be gone,
I better things do see.
5
A Pilgrim loves good company,
Don't care to go alone;
So do God's Saints delight in such
Who do Christ Jesus own;
6
And walk with them in the same way,
If that they be sincere,
They prize their precious company,
They helpful to each are.
7
A Pilgrim, when he is come near home,
He greatly does rejoice;
O let such Saints whose work's near done,
Lift up with joy their voice.
HYMN 130.
Job 9. 34. Let him take his Rod from me.
1
LOrd, if we do thy Word transgress,
And against thee offend,
Thou will chastise us, more or less,
By trials thou do send:
2
But thou will not thy love remove,
Thy Covenant is sure;
It Is but our Souls to try and prove
To make us all more pure.
3
Fathers, we know, have diverse Rods,
And as the offense may be,
They lighter or the heavier strike,
And so likewise does he.
4
It Is always for our good we know
He puts our Souls to grief,
And thou great bowels, Lord, do show,
And sends us then relief.
5
O then, ye Saints, don't think it strange
That God his Rod does use,
But bear it, and give praise to him,
And mark what next ensues.
6
After he has you tried, ye shall
Come forth like pure Gold,
And in Afflictions to you all
God will his love unfold.
HYMN 131.
Lam. 3. 2. And brought me into darkness.
1
DArkness sometimes, Lord, does invade
The Children of the Day;
Yet we should, when we want sweet Light,
Our Souls upon thee stay.
2
The Sun sometimes is hid from us,
And then with us it is Night;
So Darkness does upon us seize,
When we have lost the sight
3
Of thee, O Lord, if thou art hid,
That we cannot see thy face;
O then it is night, and we bewail
Our sad and woeful case.
5
But though dark Clouds do cover us,
And we are in the night;
Yet will our Sun rise up and shine,
And we shall have sweet light.
5
But O how sad and comfortless
Is it i* the dark to dwell!
But what is the darkness Saints see here,
To the darkness that is in Hell!
6
Then do not mourn, ye gracious Souls,
Your darkness soon will fly,
And you shall precious Light enjoy
Unto eternity.
HYMN 132.
Isa. 4. 6. A Covert from the Storm, etc.
1
SAd Storms and Tempests we expect
Whilst Winter-days do last;
And so do Saints, whilst they are here,
Look for a piercing blast.
2
As by some certain Signs Men know
A Storm is very near,
So do thy Saints, O Lord, likewise
Foresee their troubles here;
3
And therefore should prepare for them
By warning thou do give,
And carefully their lives amend,
And all more godly live:
4
And also with the greatest care
Haste to their hiding place
By Faith and Prayer get into thee;
For whilst they see thy face,
5
And do enjoy thy presence sweet,
They nothing need to fear;
But we, alas, through unbelief,
Astonished often are.
6
But let us know, O Lord, we pray,
That Ship can never sink
In which the blessed Jesus is,
Whatever we may think.
7
In this also much comfort lies,
Thou can the Winds command,
And still the Seas, and make a calm
By thy own mighty hand.
HYMN 133.
Psalm. 42. 7. All thy Floods and Waves are gone over me.
1
THe Floods, O Lord, the Floods do rise,
They roar, and make a noise;
The Floods break out and swell a^^in,
And do list up their voice.
2
There Is many Waters we do see
That threaten us full sore;
The wicked rage and swell in wrath,
O Lord, still more and more.
3
They all conspire with one heart
How they may thee withstand;
Arise, O Lord, and take our part,
They are in league and band.
4
The Tents of all the Edomites,
The Ishmaelites also,
The Hagarens and the Moabites,
With diverse others too.
5
Gebal with Amon, and likewise
Does Amaleck conspire;
The Philistines against thee rise,
With them that dwell at Tire.
6
O thou who sits upon the Floods
To rule and govern all,
Break forth upon thine Enemies,
And give them their last fall.
HYMN 134.
The Second Part.
1
ONe grief, and then another does
Like Clouds their Waters pour;
The Floods of cursed evil Men
Do threaten to devour
2
Thy People all: O Lord, look down!
Rebuke them in thy wrath!
Thou art our hope and our defense,
O stretch thine Arm now forth,
3
And let them know they are but Men,
And must subject to thee;
What evil they intend to do,
Let it prevented be;
4
And we will lift thy Name on high,
And them we will not fear,
If thou will, Lord, our sins forgive,
And for our help appear.
HYMN 135.
Heb. 3. 7. To day if you will hear his voice.
1
TO day, O hear God's gracious Call,
O don't the time delay!
The morrow you must not boast of,
It Is now whilst it is to day.
2
Night is no time to do work in,
And Night will soon be here;
O then repent and leave your sin I
To Jesus lend your Ear.
3
To Day, whilst the sweet Sun does shine,
O hearken to God's Word!
Now whilst you have the Means of Grace,
Turn ye unto the Lord.
4
The Morning of your Day is gone,
Nay it is already Noon;
The Evening too is coming on,
And here it will be soon.
5
Your Sun begins to draw full low,
And quickly will go down;
Rouse up and do your work apace,
Before your Day is gone.
HYMN 136.
Mat. 12. 20. A bruised Reed shall he not break, and smoking Flax shall he not
quench.
1
THat Soul, O Lord, in whom's begun
The blessed work of Grace,
Though he may droop, and broken be,
Yet shall behold thy face.
2
The feeble and desponding Soul
That Is like a bruised Reed,
Thou will, Lord, take pity upon,
And soon supply his need.
3
Although he is like to smoking Flax,
Where little fire is seen;
Yet he shall see that work go on
Which shall destroy his sin.
4
Grace at the first seems to be small,
Which makes the Soul to doubt,
That in him there is none at all,
Yet thou will bring him out
Of all his fears, and he shall have
A glorious victory,
And triumph shall in Songs of Praise
To all eternity.
HYMN 137.
1 Cor. 15. 36. Thou Fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, unless it
die.
1
LIke as the Seed which Men do sow
Some time lies in the Earth;
And then it sprouts, and we all see
A Resurrection has.
2
And as the Seed, unless it die,
It is not quickened;
So we first die, and afterward
Are raised from the dead.
3
Death does approach, all Men must die,
And turn unto the dust;
The Grave that is the House for all,
And thither go we must.
4
Uncertain is the time of death,
It Is certain all must die;
And certain it is when death does come,
Comes in eternity.
5
No Mortal can himself deliver
From the power of the Grave;
And as we die, so we are sure
Another life to have.
The Second Part.
1
The Resurrection-day will come,
When we shall rise again;
Remember well the Day of Doom,
And where you must remain;
2
For if in sin at last you die,
To Hell you shall be cast;
But if in Christ you fall asleep,
Your happiness will last
3
For evermore; you shall then be
With Christ and holy Men,
Where you shall with the Angels sing
All praise to God, Amen.
4
Blessed are they who in the Lord
At last do come to die;
For as all such from labor rest,
So shall assuredly
5
At the great day, when Christ appears,
Appear in glory bright,
And in God's Kingdom shall henceforth
Shine like the Morning light.
6
Then do not mourn for such who die
In Christ their dearest Friend;
Their gain is great, of all their grief
There is a final end.
HYMN 138.
1 Thessalonians. 4. 14. Them that sleep in Jesus, will God bring with him.
1
DEath is a sleep, it is a rest
From all our labor here,
And to the Saints it is the best,
And so it will appear
2
They fall asleep in a sweet place,
They sleep in Jesus do;
They Union have with him through Grace,
Which death cannot overthrow.
3
Death cannot dissolve that blessed Knot,
That union does remain,
And unto Jesus Christ do go,
Death unto Saints is gain.
4
But though the Sinner falls asleep,
His sleep is troublesome;
His Spirits shall no rest receive
Till the last day does come;
5
But under wrath and dreadful Ire
His Spirit then shall lie;
When death dos come, he feels Hellfire,
He sleeps in misery.
6
It Is but one part that takes rest,
That Sleep too soon will over,
When God will on Body and Soul
Eternal vengeance pour.
HYMN 139.
Phil. 1. 13. Having a desire to depart and be with Christ, etc.
1
DEpart from what? and whither go?
But why art in such haste?
O it is because thou well did know
How sweet Christ's love does taste.
2
Depart from Earth, and go to Heaven,
From Saints that dwell below,
To them to whom blessed Crowns are given,
Who do no sorrow know.
3
Depart from Sin and Suffering,
To go to lasting bliss;
From being Poor, to be a King!
What change is there like this?
4
But yet thou must wait till the time
That God prefixed has;
And then thou shall depart in peace,
And have the end of Faith.
5
O happy Man, thou art the Lord's,
Let death come when it will:
And he thy precious Soul at last
Will with his glory fill.
HYMN 140.
Psalm. 49. 14. And the Righteous shall have dominion over them in the morning.
1
THe Morning comes when Night is gone,
The Night is now far spent;
The Resurrection day comes on,
When Jesus shall be sent
2
To call the Dead out of their Graves,
That is the Morning sure
Which will not have another Night,
That Day will last for ever.
3
Thy Sun will rise, and never go down'
And then thou shall awake
Out of thy Bed, and have a Crown
That will thee happy make.
4
Thou wast of no esteem on Earth,
But a poor Underlin;
But shall at last dominion have
When that day does begin.
5
It will a Morning be in which
No Clouds shall more appear;
Thy Sun shall rise, and shine he shall
Beyond all shinings here.
6
O wait, ye* Saints, then for the Morn!
Look up, it is even day!
Break forth and sing all Saints of God,
Who dwell in House of Clay:
7
Your day does hasten on apace,
Look up, lift up your Eyes,
The Morning comes when you shall rule
Over all your Enemies.
HYMN 141.
Rev. 20. 12. And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God, and the
Books were opened, etc.
1
HArk how the mighty Trumpet sounds,
The Judge is on the Throne!
Now joy to Saints shall much abound,
But hark how Sinners groan!
2
Now, now the Books shall opened be,
The Judgment-day is come;
And Christ will judge impartially,
And Sinners shall be dumb;
3
Nothing to say: Ah! no excuse ^
All silent, all are mute,
And shall the Sentence now receive,
Which wrath will execute.
4
Rejoice, ye Saints, for Christ will say,
O Come who are blessed!
Ye blessed of my Father, now
With joy lift up your head,
5
And take the Kingdom long prepared
For you: But ah! alas!
The wicked then will houl and cry
To see their woeful case.
HYMN 142. Of Heaven.
2 Timothy 4. 8. Henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righteousness, etc.
1
NO sooner shall the Judgment end,
But Saints shall crowned be,
And shine they shall in glorious Robes
Unto eternity.
2
Then shall we see the blessed One
Who crowned was with Thorns,
Who shed for us his precious Blood,
Whose Heart was broke with scorns:
3
Him whom our Souls so dearly love,
We all shall shortly see
With open face, and shall above
With him for ever be.
4
That Man that here met with disgrace,
We there shall see so bright,
That Angels cannot behold his face
For its exceeding light.
5
What gladness will possess our heart
When we shall see these things!
For light and life in every part
Will rise like lasting Springs.
6
Next unto Christ we shall behold
Saints Souls in glory shine,
Whose Bodies shall be made like his,
All glorious, all divine.
HYMN 143.
The Second Part.
1
EAch Saint shall then shine more or less
In Crowns excelling Gold,
Triumph they shall in heavenly bliss
Amazing to behold;
And each of them in majesty
Shall represent a King;
Yea, Angel-like for dignity,
And shall with Cherubs sing:
3
Immortal are they every one,
And shine like to the Sun;
Their glory also shall abide,
Their day shall never be done:
4
Their Bodies which sometimes were torn,
And Bones that broken were,
For Jesus's sake he will adorn
With health and glory fair.
5
They shall also with Angels then
Join in sweet harmony,
To sing and celebrate God's praise
Unto eternity.
6
This we shall hear, this we shall see,
While raptured in bliss,
When we with blessed Jesus be;
What happiness like this?
HYMN 144.
The Third Part.
1
OUr Friends that lived Godly here
Shall there he found again;
Ah! we shall meet, and then we shall
Together all remain.
2
This is the place, this is the state
Of all that are sincere,
Which Men nor Angels can relate,
So great's the glory there.
3
Grace here does tune our hearts and tongues
For heavenly harmony,
That sing we may with Angels all
Unto eternity.
4
Here run the Crystal streams of Life
Quite thorough all our Veins;
Grace does our Souls to God unite,
Like glorious Golden Chains:
We here are made both fit and meet
For that Inheritance,
5
Where we shall reign triumphantly,
And have pre-eminence.
6
Now that which sweetens all is this,
Our glory will remain;
No end will there be of our bliss,
When we begin to reign.
7
In hopes of that high glory then
Break forth, ye Saints, and sing;
And also live unto the praise
Of your most glorious King.
HYMN 145. Of Hell.
Mark 9. 46. Where the Worm dies not, and the Fire is not quenched.
1
WHen Saints shall glorified be,
The Sinners pangs excel;
When Saints shall all in Heaven sing,
Sinners shall houl in Hell.
2
The foolish Sinner little thinks
What sorrows will abound
Within himself, when on the brink
Of Tophet he is found.
3
Hell is, alas, beyond all thought
So frightful, and forlorn;
No mortal Creature can relate
The pangs that there are born.
4
God will exclude them evermore
From his most blessed face:
And them involve in misery,
In shame, and in disgrace.
5
God is the Fountain of all Good,
Of Life, of Light and peace;
They then must needs be wretched all
Who are deprived of these.
6
Unto a dreadful burning Lake
All on a fiery flame
Hell is compared; woe to them
Who once do feel the same.
HYMN 146.
The Second Part.
1
NO light, but darkness there does dwell!
No peace, but horror strange:
Ah! they who once do come to Hell,
Will find a dismal ch^nge;
2
A fiery Lake, a Furnace hot,
A Burning Oven too
It is compared in God's Word,
And thither Sinners go.
3
And further, God to show their state
Who in their sins do die,
Compares it to burning Brimstone,
To show their misery.
4
And as a stinking steam and smoke
Of Brimstone bad does smell,
And blinds the Eyes, and Stomach choaks,
So are the pangs of Hell.
5
To see a Sea of Brimstone burn,
Would it you not affright?
But they whom God to Hell does turn,
Are in a worser plight.
6
This burning cannot quenched be,
No, not with Tears of Blood;
No mournful groans in misery
Will there do any good.
7
O damned Sinners see your fate,
The Day of Grace is done;
Repentance now is much too late,
All mercy's fled and gone.
The Second Part.
1 Pet. 3. 19. The Spirits in Prison.
1
Hell also, in another place,
Is called a Prison too;
And all to show the woeful case
Of such sin does undo:
2
Which Prison, with its Lock and Bars
Of God's lasting Decree,
Will hold them fast; O how this marrs
All thoughts of being free.
3
Out of these brazen Bars may they
The Saints in glory see;
But this will not their grief allay,
But to them torment be.
4
Those Chains that darkness on them hangs,
Still rattling in their Ears,
Creates within them heavy pangs,
And still augments their Tears.
6
Thus hopeless of all remedy,
They dyingly do sink
Into the Jaws of Misery,
And Seas of Sorrows drink;
6
For being filled on every fide
With helplesness and grief,
Headlong into despair they slide,
Bereft of all relief.
The Third Part.
Hell a bottomless Pit.
1
And Hell also is called a Pit,
Prepared for those that die
The Second Death, a term most fit
To show their misery.
2
A Pit that is bottomless is this,
A Gulf of grief and woe,
A Dungeon which they cannot miss,
That will them quite undo.
3
Thus without stay they always sink,
Thus fainting till they fail;
Despair they up like water drink,
These Prisoners have no Bail.
4
Here meets them now that Worm that gnaws,
And plucks their Bowels out;
The pit too on them shuts her Jaws,
This dreadful is no doubt.
5
This ghastly Worm is guilt of sin,
Which on their Conscience feeds,
With Vipers Teeth both sharp and keen,
Whereat it sorely bleeds.
6
This Worm is sed by memory,
Which strictly brings to mind
All things done in their Body here,
As we in Scripture find.
7
Their Conscience is the Slaughter-shop,
There hangs the Axe and Knife;
It Is there the Worm does them torment,
With most egregious strife.
8
They sooner may drink up the Sea
Than shake off these their fears,
Or make another in one day
As big with brinish tears.
9
They sooner may the Stars account
Than loose their dismal bands,
Or tell the number of their Hairs,
Or number of the Sands
10
Of the Seashore, as see the end*
Of their sad misery;
O Sinners fear and tremble all!
Think on Eternity.
The End of the Seventh Part.
PART VIII. SACRED HYMNS of Praise, on several Occasions: As they have been
sung in several Congregations*
HYMN 147.
Sin laid upon Christ.
1
LO, Christ has suffered for us all
When Enemies we were,
Therefore we will thy Name extol,
Whose love did thus appear;
2
For we like Sheep have gone astray,
And ready were to fall;
And God has lain the load on thee,
To give rest to us all.
3
Thy precious Praises therefore, Lord,
Sincerely let us sing,
And laud thy Name with one accord,
O God and heavenly King;
4
For all thy loving kindness, Lord,
And for thy truth divine;
For thou have made thy holy Word
Over all thy Name to shine.
5
Help us to praise thee, and to live
Wholly alone to thee,
And not forget from whence does come
Our present liberty.
6
O shine upon thy Church always,
And bless our joynt-endeavour;
And prosper thou our handiwork
Now and the same for ever.
HYMN 148.
To be sung after the Lord's Supper.
The good Physician.
1
THy love, O Lord, was very great
To such vile ones as we;
Our hearts were once dead as a stone,
But now they quickened be.
2
Slight Balm may heal a slighter sore,
But there is no Medicine good
Which can to life our Souls restore,
But the Physician's Blood.
3
Lord Jesus when we thee espy,
Though life is almost gone,
We see by Faith we shall not die,
All praise to thee alone
4
Who have poured in sweet Oil and Wine
To heal each wounded heart;
O thou will heal all Souls of thine,
Who for their sakes did smart.
5
We therefore will unto thee sing,
And thee always adore;
To him from whom all Blessings spring
Be praise for evermore.
HYMN 149.
A Hymn of Praise after the Lord's Supper.
The Banqueting House.
1
HAlleluja let us sing aloud,
Salvation, Glory, Fame,
Be given to the Lord our God,
O glorify his Name,
2
Who loved us, and sent his Son
For our eternal good,
To wash away our scarlet sins
In his most precious Blood.
3
Into the House of Banqueting
He brings us to be fed,
Love is the Banner flourishing
With honor over our head.
4
Beneath his shadow we are placed
With joy and true content;
His Fruit is sweet unto our taste,
His Word and Sacrament.
5
O draw me my dear Savior then
With thy strong Cords of Love,
And we will all run after thee
As fast as we can move:
6
And in thy Name, O Lord, we'll trust,
For that is a Tower strong,
Whither the Righteous often does fly
For shelter all day long.
HYMN 150.
Divine Wrath.
1
THe day does come, and burn it will
Like to an Oven hot;
And all the proud shall be Fuel
Who have the Lord forgot:
2
Nay it begins now to break forth,
And will burn more and more;
On all the wicked of the Earth
God will his vengeance pour.
3
Evil shall slay the wicked Man
For sin which he has wrought;
And such who hate God's faithful Ones,
Shall quickly come to naught.
4
But all who do fear thee, O Lord,
Thou will keep safe and sound;
And such who put their trust in thee,
Thou never wilt confound,
5
But save them in the day of wrath,
The which is very nigh,
When all the wicked of the Earth
In direful Flames shall lie.
HYMN 151.
A Hymn of Praise after the Sacrament.
The Bread of Life.
1
WIth precious Food, Lord, we are fed,
Which we have cause to prize;
Our Table is most richly spread
With choice Varieties.
2
The harmless Lamb most innocent
For us is ready slain,
And we as Guests are hither sent
To feed on him again.
3
But O what Love and Grace is here!
When we were hungry,
Christ's Body, Lord, thou did prepare
That for us he might die;
4
For nothing but his Flesh and Blood
Could our poor Souls sustain;
Therefore, O Lord, thou did cry forth,
O let my Lamb be slain.
5
O let his precious Blood run out,
For to them it I Will give,
Or else they will perish without doubt;
It Is do^^^ Come, eat, and live!
6
Eat, eat, O Friends, on what is good,
And drink abundantly;
The best of Heaven is your Food,
No fatness I deny.
7
O Lord, thy Love is very sweet,
And we therefore do cry,
O feed us with this precious Food
Until we come to die.
8
And we will sing thy Praises, Lord,
Even both rich and poor;
And to the blessed Lamb we'll sing
Praises for evermore.
HYMN 152.
A Hymn of Praise after the Lord* Supper.
Saints die with Christ.
1
ALI glory unto Christ the Lord,
It Is thy immortal fame
We will sing forth with one accord,
And glorify thy Name.
2
O blessed God, thou art all Love,
No minute escapes thy breast,
But brings a favor from above,
In that sweet love we rest.
3
Lord, did thou die, and do we live?
Has not grief slain us yet?
Vocuhsafe to us thy grace to give,
To live as it is meet.
4
Did thy most precious love to me
Make thee to leave thy Throne,
And mount the Stage of Infamy?
And shall thou die alone?
5
Lord, let me die unto sin,
That death, O let me see;
Be thou the death of sin, O Lord,
Which was death unto thee;
6
And as all fullness is in thee,
O then we pray pour in,
For we are empty thou do know,
Except it be of sin.
7
And since thou have, O Holy One,
A Salve for every Sore*
Let us rejoice and praise thy Name
Now and for evermore.
HYMN 153.
Luke 13. 10. Joy in Heaven when Sinners repent.
1
LOrd, is there joy in Heaven above*
When Sinners turn to thee?
Let this our Souls affections move,
To long till it we see.
2
What cause of joy then has that heart
Who with repenting tears
Unfeignedly cleaves unto thee,
And to thy ways adheres.!
3
Shall holy Angels, Lord, rejoice
In our sweet happiness,
When all the good is unto us,
To them not more nor less?
4
In this they act, Lord, like to thee,
Who for our only good
Was sacrificed on the Tree,
To wash us in thy Blood:
5
And shall not we now learn of thee
To seek the good of others?
And with one heart strive to impart
All comfort to our Brothers?
6
Rejoice with them that do rejoice,
This duty let us love;
And then thy Will we shall fulfill
As Angels do above.
7
But what a low and carnal heart
Has he, whoever he he,
Who being full, will not impart
To those in misery!
8
To pity, and not to relieve,
Does certainly declare
Such never did God's Grace receive
In truth, nor are sincere.
9
Acknowledge how you have transgressed
Against the Lord your God,
And let it be with grief confessed
What Bypath you have trod;
10
For if we do our sins confess,
Faithful and Just is he,
From sin and all unrighteousness
To cleanse and set us free.
HYMN 154. Sung after Sermon.
Psalm. 31. 19. Great Goodness laid up, and wrought out.
1
GReat Goodness thou, O Lord, have wrought
Who can of it conceive?
And those thou do regenerate,
It Is they do it receive:
2
It Is they who are delivered
From that forlorn estate
They once were in when they lay dead
Under thy fearful hate.
3
It Is they whose Souls united be
Unto thy self, O Lord;
And have Communion too with thee,
And prize thy blessed Word.
4
They are alive, and love thee dear,
Thy Image also they
Do in their Souls most clearly bear,
And taste of thee each day.
5
They of Christ's Blood and Merits shall
For certain have a part;
And though they sin, they cannot fall
From thee, Lord, in their heart.
6
Their Souls shall live eternally,
They sing thy praise therefore;
This work being wrought in our Souls,
We'll sing for evermore.
HYMN 155. A Hymn of Praise after the Sacrament.
A Feast of Fat things.
1
LOrd, thou our blessed Physician art,
Who for our Souls did die;
Thou do thy precious Blood impart,
Our Souls to purify.
2
When sin and sickness did appear,
And naught could do us good,
A Medicine then thou did prepare,
To heal us with thy Blood.
3
Thou art, O Lord, our glorious Sun,
Light, Heat and Life's from thee;
And thou upon our Souls has shone,
By which we quickened be.
4
A Banquet rich thou do provide,
A Table of Fat things;
To feast our Souls, O let us eat
And drink of thy own Springs.
5
The Feast is thine, of thine own cost,
The Lamb is of thy Fold;
It is the best in all the Flock,
More precious far than Gold.
6
No spot in him was ever found,
No blemish, but all pure;
Yet for us he had many wounds,
Thy wrath he did endure.
7
He drank the bitter of the Cup,
That no wrath might remain,
That we might drink in draughts of love,
And come to life again,
8
And spend our days upon the Earth
In joy, through thy sweet Spirit,
Until we come thy glory great
In Heaven to inherit.
HYMN 156.
Psalm. 31. 19. Goodness wrought.
1
HOw great is thy sweet goodness, Lord,
Which for us thou have wrought
By Jesus Christ, our dearest Friend,
Who our dear Souls has bought;
2
That so we might that goodness have,
His Life he did lay down,
Our Souls from Death and Hell to save,
And us with glory crown.
3
And as for us, Christ wrought it out,
So in us we do see
The Spirit works without all doubt,
That we convinced might be:
4
And so does cause us for to feel
What unto sin is due,
The weight of which would make us reel,
And vengeance soon ensue.
5
But it is to heal that he does wound
The Soul, and makes it cry;
And then with speed he does make haste
A Plaster to apply.
6
None but thy Spirit can convince,
And us for Grace prepare;
And we, O Lord, may see from hence
How helpless once we were.
7
To God the Father, and the Son,
And Holy Ghost therefore,
Be blessing, honor, and renown,
Now and for evermore.
HYMN 157.
Sung after Sermon.
Romans 1. 6. The Gospel the power of God.
1
WE of thy Gospel holy, Lord,
Are not ashamed to own;
Because thy glory shines therein,
And power is made known.
2
Thy Gospel is the means whereby
We, Lord, came to believe,
And in it does great Riches lie,
Which we by Faith receive.
3
Thy Grace in it does glorious shine,
And by thy Spirit we
Are wrought upon, and so made thine,
And union have with thee.
4
What cause have we therefore to sing
That we thy Gospel have,
And praise our God and heavenly King,
Who strives our Souls to save!
5
Our Enemies the Light do hate,
And fain would once again
Suppress the Gospel, as or late;
O it is their bitter pain
6
To see how Light and Truth breaks out,
But this is, Lord, our joy;
Arise and put them to the rout
Who would thy Truth destroy:
7
And we thy Praises will sing forth,
And laud thy Name therefore;
O let thy Word shine through the Earth
Now and for evermore.
HYMN 158.
The joyful Sound.
1
WHo has or does, O Lord, believe
The Report which thou have given?
Many will hear, ^but few receive
The joyful News from Heaven.
2
The joyful Sound that is spread abroad
There Is few which it do mind;
For though they have it often heard,
Yet not with hearts inclined
3
To that which is most truly good
They have no mind at all
But contrar'wise despise thy Word,
And do contemn thy Call:
4
But unto some thou do make known
Thy glorious power divine;
And these are they that thou do own,
And call also thine.
5
They do believe, and also fear;
They love and do obey:
They cleave to thee, and are sincere,
And follow thee always.
6
And them do thou with Blessings crown,
They sing to thee therefore;
And hence it is thou do them own,
And wilt for evermore.
HYMN 159.
Psalm. 23. 3. The Sinners Soul restored.
1
It Is thou, O Lord, who do restore
Our Souls which went astray,
And had been lost for evermore
Had thou not found a way
2
For to recover us again,
By sending of thy Son;
Under thy wrath we should have lain,
And ever been undone.
3
Our sin and sickness was so sore,
Nothing could do us good;
Nor life unto our Souls restore,
But the Physicians Blood.
4
Our case was sad, woeful indeed,
If it we did but know;
Thou therefore sentst thy Son to bleed,
Such bowels did thou show,
5
That he for us, and in our stead
Thy dreadful wrath did bear,
That of his Flesh our Souls might seed,
Lost strength for to repair.
6
Therefore we sing, Lord, unto thee,
And well indeed may they
Who by thy Grace now quickened be,
And set in the right way
7
Unto eternal happiness,
Whose Souls thou do restore;
They all praise thee, Lord, more or less,
And shall for evermore.
HYMN 160.
The Godly Man's Soul restored.
1
A Godly Man may greatly fall,
But thou, Lord, wilt restore
His Soul again, and so he shall
Stand faster than before.
2
He under sin long shall not lie
Before he does revive;
And whilst he is down, his Soul does cry,
And greatly does he strive
3
Against all sin, and it does hate,
And fain would he get clear
Of every sin and evil thing,
To show he is sincere.
4
But wicked Men do make a trade
Of sinning every day,
Their hearts are carnal, and so hard,
Sins motions they obey;
5
And in them also it does reign,
And they in it delight;
Hence under wrath they do remain,
Being odious in thy sight.
6
All praise to God, the Lord above,
We find it otherwise,
That sin we hate, and thee do love,
And thy sweet favor prize.
7
Good Men cannot contented be,
Unless restored again,
And thy most precious sace do see,
And pardon do obtain.
8
All glory to thy gracious Name
We give to thee therefore.
And do resolve for to proclaim
Thy praise for evermore.
HYMN 161.
Psalm. 23. 3. The glorious restoration of the Soul.
1
THe Restoration of the Soul
It is the work alone
Of thy own Grace, O God most high,
Which to us is made known.
2
Thy wisdom and thy power divine,
And mercy infinite,
In equal glory, Lord, does shine
Hereby in all Men's sight.
3
If thou had not stretched out thy hand
Our Souls thus to restore,
We must have lain in Satan's band,
O Lord, for evermore.
4
But are our Souls restored indeed,
And raised to life again?
And from eternal death so freed,
Shall never feel that pain?
5
And shall also preserved be
Unto eternal bliss;
Well may such sing continually,
What comfort, Lord, like this!
6
What ground of joy and gladness's here?
We'll raise thy praise therefore;
For all restored Souls shall sing
To thee for evermore.
The Second Part.
The Sinner's misery, and the Saints glory.
1
Sad was the Loss Man did sustain
By his most dismal Fall;
God's Image marred, his Soul depraved,
And brought into great thrall;
2
Defiled, wounded, and naked made,
And dead in sin did lie;
Thus did his glory at once fade
Through his iniquity.
3
Bound in strong Bonds in Satan's Chains
His Eyes put out also;
He wickedly his God disdains,
To him a cursed Foe.
4
For in the mind such enmity
Is there in each vile one,
That they resist thee day and night,
And bid thee to be gone.
5
But yet such Grace did thou extend
To such a filthy Foe,
As to send Christ, thy only Son,
The Devil to overthrow,
6
And Man redeem with stretched out Hand,
Thy Image to restore;
And heal his wounds, and make him see
Who was so blind before.
7
Into sweet Union with thy self
Thou ta^^st him once again;
And he in thine own Bosom's laid,
The Enmity being slain.
8
From sickness he is recovered,
From bondage quite ser free*
He lives again who once was dead,
And dearly now loves thee.
9
Well may this cause all Souls to sing
Who thus restored be;
For unto them, Lord, from hence springs
Joy to eternity.
HYMN 163.
The precious Promises.
1
A Happy Soul, O Lord, is he
Who Union has with thee;
The Promises to him are given,
Which sweet and precious be.
2
Lord, when thou giv'st thy self to us,
Promises are precious;
But never till we did believe,
Could we e're find them thus.
3
All praise to God, the Lord on high,
And to Christ who did die
To purchase for us Blessings store
To all Eternity.
4
We now therefore, O Lord, will sing
Unto our glorious King,
From whence the precious Promises
Of Grace to us do spring.
5
What precious Blessings do we see,
Who interest have in thee!
And shall be happy evermore
Unto eternity.
HYMN 164.
A Hymn of Praise after the Sacrament.
1
HAlleluja! O happy day
That ever Christ was born!
And happy we that e're we see
This everlasting Morn.
2
Blessed be the Lamb that hither came
To be a Sacrifice;
It Is by thy Blood we have all good,
In thee all Blessings lies.
3
Our Bands to break thou did them take,
And with them thou wast bound*
God's Cords we burst, thou wast acurst
To heal our grievous Wound;
4
For us he died, being crucified,
Sustained that cruel death;
Wast broke with grief, used as a Thief,
And gave up his sweet breath.
5
His Grave was made, and Body laid
With the rich and unjust;
His Honor high despised did lie
All covered up in Dust.
6
Admirable sight, a love most bright,
Never the like was seen,
That one so high so low should lie,
Vile Wretches to redeem.
Amongst Men, what one would e're have gone
His Son thus to abase,
For Enemies that him despise,
And were in such a case.
8
Praised be the Lord, praised be the Word
And Spirit too therefore;
Sing praise will we to the blessed Three,
Now and for evermore.
HYMN 165.
Man's Impotency.
1
HOw weak, O Lord, is sinful Man,
O how unable's he
To act or do, much less to run,
Until he is drawn by thee!
2
We, Lord, have no sufficiency,
Nor power of our own,
To think so much as one good thought,
As of our selves alone;
3
But all our whole sufficiency
Does from the Lord proceed,
Who works in us most graciously
Both the will and the deed.
4
O draw us then our Savior dear
With thy strong Cords of Love,
And then will we run after thee
As fast as we can move.
5
Shall we by thy own sovereign Grace
These special drawings find;
Then shall we run our heavenly Race
With a sweet raised Mind.
HYMN 166.
Isa. 55. 1. Come ye to the Waters.
1
O Come, ye thirsty Souls, and drink;
O Come, do not delay!
Is it not time, can any think,
With speed to come away?
2
O precious Grace and Love divine,
Lord, we adore thee do,
And praise that holy Name of thine
From whence these Waters flow.
3
Waters of Life, how sweet are they
To him that thirsts sore!
O he esteems them each day,
And loves them more and more.
4
They who of them do drink shall live,
Yea, and shall never die;
And all that come, may them receive,
Thou will not one deny.
5
They heal the sick and wounded heart
And give sight to the blind;
There Is none shall ever be undone
Who do these Waters find.
6
All praise and glory unto God
We have these Waters store;
Let Us drink of them and let us live,
And praise thee evermore.
HYMN 167.
Glorious Light shining forth.
1
NOw Christ is preached unto us,
His glorious Name made known;
The Morning Star sends forth his light,
Dark Shadows now are gone.
2
The Morning of that longed for Day
Will soon break forth amain,
When glory great shall fill the Earth,
And Jesus Christ shall reign.
3
'Twill quickly be that we shall sing
A new and pleasant Song,
And shall exalt poor Sions King,
For whose sweet day we long.
4
He that his Soul poured forth to death,
And died a Sacrifice,
Will like a Lion quickly rouse,
And all his Foes surprise.
5
The gracious Lamb that hither came
For Sinners to be slain,
Is worthy of all glory great,
And therefore shall he reign.
6
The Song of Moses and the Lamb
Redeemed Ones shall sing;
O let us on his side be found
Sincere in every thing.
7
O happy they who thee have got
That suffered on the Tree,
And count all things as Dung and Dross
When once compared to thee.
8
Then shall we find peace in our mind
When thus we prize thy Name;
And fill^d shall we with glory be,
Whilst others filled with shame.
HYMN 168.
The panting Soul.
1
ONe thing, O Lord, thy Saints desire,
And would obtain of thee,
Within thy Temple to enquire,
Thy beauty there to see;
2
That there may be our dewlling place,
Let us this mercy crave,
And all provision of thy Grace
There daily also have:
3
That to our joy we all may drink
Of living lasting Springs,
And also know and the will do
Of thee the King of Kings:
4
And being fed with living Bread,
May praise thy Name therefore;
Refreshed from thee, from thirsting free,
May sing for evermore.
HYMN 169.
Everlasting Rest.
1
TO the Eternal God above
Let us loud praise proclaim;
Since we have tasted of his Love,
Let Us glorify his Name.
2
A blessed rest he has in store
For all who are upright,
Where they shall be for evermore
In his eternal light.
3
All Tears from off our Eyes shall then
Be wiped quite away;
And we shall never mourn again
On that eternal day.
4
O then let us fear lest we fall short
Of that sweet resting place;
For many seem to bid fair ^or't,
Without one dram of Grace.
5
Let us truly converted be,
And Oil have much in store;
For then through thee enter shall we
Before thou shut the door:
6
And with joy sing unto our King
Eternal Songs above,
And filled all both great and small
With thy eternal Love.
HYMN 170.
Hear, and your Souls shall live.
1
THy Mercy, Lord, is infinite,
To call such unto thee,
Who loathsome are in thy own sight
By their iniquity.
2
O then let Sinners come with speed,
B'ing drawn by power divine;
Let them unto thy Call give heed,
Whilst Gospel Light does shine.
3
Come unto thee, O holy One,
And shall our Souls then live!
Let Sinners see they are undone,
Till Christ does them receive.
4
Lord, take some Sinners by the hand,
And save their Souls from Hell;
And make them bend to thy Command,
O thou can them compel
5
To come unto the Marriage Feast;
O bring them in to thee,
That they may sing thy Praises forth
To all eternity.
HYMN 171.
What shall we do?
1
O Lord, what shall poor Sinners do
Who dead in sin do lie,
And must eternal sorrow know,
If in that state they die?
2
O praised be thy holy Name
Thou have a way found out
To save us from eternal shame,
And life to work about.
3
O then shall some this day so hear,
That they may Life obtain!
Let them to Jesus Christ draw near,
And so be born again,
4
Or else they will in the Judgment-day
Condemned ever be,
And on them thou will thy wrath pour
To all eternity.
5
Then quake and tremble every one,
And not reject God's Call,
^est you at last be all undone,
And into Hell do fall.
6
O thou art good to us, O Lord,
In sending Christ to die;
If Grace thou do to us afford,
We'll sing continually.
The Second Part.
Who has made thee differ, etc.
1
O Lord, we praise thy glorious Name
For distinguishing Love;
Blessed be God Christ hither came
To lift us up above.
2
We naturally like others were,
Even cursed Foes to thee;
But thou have made thy Grace appear,
Whilst others darkness be.
3
Thou have, O Lord, the difference made,
All is of Grace alone;
Hence we have cause sweetly to sing
To thee the holy One.
4
O shall thy glorious Work appear?
Lift up thy Name on high,
That Sinners may now every where
To the Lord Jesus fly.
5
And as for us, let it be seen
We all converted be,
That so we may thy Praises sing
To all eternity.
HYMN 173.
If the Son make you free, etc.
1
HAlleluja to thee the Lord above,
His Praises let us sing;
Exalt his Name continually
From whom all Blessings spring.
2
Who did behold us when we lay
Polluted in our sin;
And to wash us found out a way
To make us clean again.
3
We Slaves of Sin and Satan were,
And in strong Bonds were bound;
And when no other help was there,
From thee we help have found.
4
Thy Son out of thy Bosom came
Our Souls for to set free;
All praise unto the Son of God,
And equal praise to thee,
5
The Father of our glorious Lord,
The God of Grace and Love,
Who did us pity, and afford
Salvation from above.
6
No freedom, Lord, f^^ sin is there,
But by the Son alone
Who did thy wrath from Sinners bear,
Who were all quite undone.
7
Let such who liberty now have,
Thy Praises sing therefore;
For them will thou from bondage save,
O Lord, for evermore.
HYMN 174.
A Hymn after a Farewell Sermon.
1
SHine forth, O Lord, upon our Souls,
And let thy Showers fall,
That so we may be rooted well,
And flourish great and small.
2
We have a sweet reviving time,
Who lately seemed as dead;
When shall we be as in the prime?
O raise our withered Head!
3
We have had a sore Winters day,
A pinching time was here;
But shall such Weather fly away,
And springing times draw near?
4
We praise thy great and glorious Name
For Seasons we have had,
O let us not be put to shame,
But in thy self be glad.
5
We now must part, and for a while
Not see each other here;
So let us walk, that when Christ comes,
With him we may appear,
6
And sing sweet Songs of Melody,
And Joy in God above;
And ravished be eternally
With his transcendant Love.
HYMN 175.
Christ knocks at the Door.
1
THou, Lord, knocks at the Sinner's Door,
Desiring to come in,
To store their hearts with precious Grace,
And to destroy their sin.
2
Thy Love is great, and therefore, Lord,
Do wait on them we see,
Who will attend unto thy Word,
And open unto thee.
3
Lord, thou do knock and call aloud,
Sinners rouse up with speed;
If you do open unto him,
No good thing shall you need.
4
Thou do not come with empty hand
To those who do believe;
For they with thee Communion have,
And such like Joys receive;
5
Which prized are by holy Ones
Thy Consolations be
Not small, O Lord, but very great,
Such do receive from thee.
6
All praise, and glory, and renown
Therefore to thee they sing;
Yea praise let us raise continually
Of Christ our glorious King.
HYMN 176.
The Footsteps of the Flock.
1
TEll me, O thou beloved One,
Where thou thy Flock do feed?
On thee we do depend alone,
That thou our Souls may lead
2
Into rich Pastures fresh and green,
Where we do comfort find,
Which does content our precious Souls*
And stay our fainting mind.
3
Thou sendst us to the first Footsteps
Of thy dear Flock of old,
There for to feed, and to lie down
In thy own blessed Fold;
4
Where rest we may under thy shade
With much delight and peace,
Where streams of joy most sweetly flow,
Which run and never cease.
6
Thou have overcome us with thy Love,
We cannot but must love thee;
And being drawn, Lord, from above,
We run continually.
6
Therefore we sing unto thy Name,
And lift thy praise on high;
And for thy sake bear any shame,
And will not thee deny.
8
If we do find we do love thee,
And thou do Love return,
We'll never cease to raise thy praise
Until our lives are done.
HYMN 177.
Act. 8. 5. Christ preached.
1
HAll eluja to the Lord on high,
All glory, honor, praise
Ascribe to him continually,
And live to him always.
2
Lift Christ on high, our glorious King,
I^ whom all fullness dwells;
He is our Life and Fountain-spring,
His glory great excells.
3
It Is Christ, O God, that we do preach,
As thou do us command;
O let thy Word Men's hearts so reach,
It may break Satan's Band.
4
O set their Souls at liberty,
And them unite to thee,
To sing thy praise melodiously
Whilst they thy glory see.
5
There Is none like Christ in all the Earth,
He is that lovely One;
His honor we would, Lord, spread forth,
And him exalt alone.
6
Thou have made him the All in all
To us in every thing;
Before him shall the mighty fall,
And own him to be King.
His Day is near, his Foes must down,
And never rise again;
And flourish must his glorious Crown,
And ever shall he reign.
HYMN 178.
A Hymn of Praise after the Lord's Supper.
Wonders of Grace.
1
O Let us all with cheerful voice
Sweet Halleluja's sing;
And magnify the Lord most high,
Our glorious God and King,
2
Who wondrous things for us have done,
Which all our Eyes behold,
In saving of his sinking Church,
As in the days of old.
3
Let us loud Praise proclaim always,
And godly also live
Continually both night and day,
And glory to him give.
4
Let Christ be had in great esteem,
And lifted up on high;
O let us all remember him
Who for us all did die.
5
How did he, Lord, with bitter cries
Make known his grief to thee,
Whilst languishing his Body hung
For us upon the Tree.
6
Unto the Cross they did thee nail,
Thy Sides they pierced also;
O let us all apply thy Blood
Which from thy Wounds did flow.
7
Its precious virtue we receive,
To purge and make us white,
That through it we might all indeed
Be lovely in thy sight.
8
Lord, did thou die that we might live?
O let us sigh and mourn,
With fervent hearts unfeignedly,
To think what thou have born
9
To save our Souls from Wrath and Hell,
That we might changed be,
And so at last in Heaven dwell
To all eternity.
HYMN 179.
A Hymn of Thanksgiving for our late Deliverance.
1
THy wondrous Acts of Grace, O Lord,
Wrought in all Peoples sight,
May stir us up with one accord
To praise thee day and night.
2
The cursed snare that Babel laid,
Is broken, Lord, by thee;
And they of whom we were afraid,
Confounded also be.
3
When we like Men near dead did lie,
And knew not what to do;
Thou did defeat our Enemy,
And them quite overthrow.
4
Thou have also, Lord, heard our Cry
For bleeding Ireland;
And saved the King, when death was nigh,
With thy blessed Right Hand.
5
And Liberty to us is given
To Worship without fear;
And with sweet Dews and Showers from Heaven
Our Souls thou now do cheer.
6
We therefore glorify thy Name
To whom all praise belongs,
And celebrate thy glorious Fame
With joy in holy Songs.
HYMN 180.
The power of Prayer.
1
PRayer is a Duty every one
Should use both day and night;
Prayer is a Duty God does love,
And in it takes delight.
2
Prayer is a Duty prevalent,
It has Jehova's Ear;
Prayer should to Heaven be daily sent
When we are in great fear.
3
VVhate're we want, if we do pray
To thee most servently,
And ask according to thy Will,
We shall have all supply.
4
To Prayer of wicked Men, O Lord,
Thou will no Answer give;
But wilt hear those who are sincere,
And do uprightly live.
5
All praise to God, the Lord most high,
Who have said, Seek my face;
VVhare're thou do our Souls deny,
Give us more of thy Grace.
HYMN 181.
Saints Safety.
1
TO God most high we lift our voice,
And sing with one accord;
For we safe always are in thee,
Our help is in the Lord.
2
Some trust in Men, and in their Wealth,
And Riches do embrace,
But, Lord, grant us thy saving health,
And shinings of thy face.
3
Thou have put gladness in our heart
By those thy Beams divine,
Much more than they who have their part
Of Corn, of Oil and Wine.
4
On thy own strength we do repose,
And thereby are secure
And safe from all most dreadful woes,
Our dewlling place is sure,
5
Within the Clifts of the blessed Rock
From whence sweet Waters flow,
And therefore will not fear that shock
That Babel will overthrow.
6
Thou have saved us from wrath to come
At the most dismal day,
And wilt save us from bloody Rome,
Who would us all betray.
7
To him that on the Throne sits down,
And Christ the Lamb therefore,
Be blessing, glory and renown
Now and for evermore.
HYMN 182.
1
ALL praise to God the glorious One.
Thy Name let us adore,
Who loved us, and sent his Son,
Praise him for evermore.
2
The Cherubims with one accord
Do sing continually;
O holy, holy, holy* Lord,
And glorious Majesty:
3
And shall not we affected be
With thy redeeming Love,
And sing to thee melodiously
With hearts raised above
4
All earthly things, since we have Springs
To drink of in the way,
That are so sweet, and make us meet
For Christ another day.
5
Our Tables spread with heavenly Bread
In presence of our Foes;
We eat fat things, and drink of Springs
From whence Soul-comfort flows.
6
What, Lord, so good as Divine Food
To those that gracious be,
And know full well naught can excel
What they enjoy of thee?
7
To God the Father, and the Son,
And Holy Ghost therefore,
Be glory, honor, and renown,
Now and for evermore.
HYMN 183.
Zach. 12. 10. And they shall look upon me whom they have pierced.
1
O Happy Souls who look to thee,
And presently do mourn
And grieve for their iniquity,
Seeing what thou have born.
2
O Lord, how did ou^ horrid sin
Upon thee heavy lie!
We pierced thee once and again
By our iniquity.
3
O let us look until we love,
And thee with joy embrace;
Men will loath Sin and it forsake
When they receive thy Grace.
4
And since there is for us relief
In thee, O Savior dear,
Let Us throw away all Unbelief,
And joyful all appear.
5
Into thy presence we are come,
Let Us make a joyful noise,
And sing to thee who it is alone
That all our Foes destroys.
6
No Enemy without, within,
But from them thou can save;
Therefore let us sing thy glorious praise,
And unto thee let us cleave.
7
Sin never shall that Soul destroy
That looks unto thee,
Such sing, and shall with inward joy
Unto Eternity.
HYMN 184.
When recovered after a Fit of Sickness, Sept. 16. 1688
1
LEt that life-breathing Face of thine,
Lord, manifested ^e;
Because thy Love excels Wine,
All upright Ones love thee.
2
Thou have, O Lord, redeemed us,
Yea, from the lowest Hell,
And raised us to an higher state
Than that from whence we sell.
3
With Flaggons of refreshing Joy,
And Comforts from above,
Stay us, O Lord, we humbly pray,
Let us be sick of Love.
4
For these great Blessings, O most High.
We will thy Praises sing,
Who have also, Lord, heard our cry,
Praise to our glorious King.
5
We cried to thee with our hearts
To make thy Servant whole,
And from the all-devouring Grave
For to return his Soul.
6
And thou do, Lord, a new life send,
And would not permit
That he should hastily descend
Into the dolesom Pit.
7
We therefore sing and give thee praise,
Most holy let us be,
With hearts united all our days
Let us live unto thee.
HYMN 185.
Rev. 3. 18. Buy of me Gold tried in the Fire.
1
LOrd, we do see that poor we be,
But thou have Riches store;
And if that we do come to thee,
We nothing shall want more.
2
What is our own to us is shown
Is good, alas, for naught;
O let it go, since we do know
Rare things are to be bought:
3
And thou do cry, O come and buy!
O blessed be the Lord!
Now is the day, let us not delay,
But close in with thy Word:
4
Then rich shall we for ever be,
And Crowns of Glory have;
And Robes so white that shine like Light
Shall we likewise receive.
5
Grace is like Gold, but does excel
Whatever is on Earth;
O happy they who know full well
Its great and glorious worth.
6
Shall they not sing who see the Spring
Of Grace does Blessings pour;
Thy holy praise we will always,
Lord, sing for evermore.
HYMN 186.
Zach. 12. 10. They shall look to me.
After Sermon.
1
YE Saints, break forth with cheerful voice,
And sing Christ's glorious praise;
His Love is sweet, O it is choice!
Ye Saints praise him always.
2
Come, look and love! O cast your Eye
Upon this lovely One!
He is your help, your Food, your Strength,
Your Hope, your Joy and Crown.
3
Christ is the Root, Christ is the Branch,
Christ is our Testator;
Christ is the holy Lamb of God,
Christ is our Mediator.
4
Christ is the Way, Christ is the Door,
Christ is our Physician;
Christ is our Meat, Christ is our Drink,
He Is thus to every Christian.
5
Christ is God's great Ambassador,
Christ is the only Heir;
Christ is the Bright and Morning Star,
Christ is beyond compare.
6
Christ is the Foundation sure,
Christ is the cornerstone;
Christ is the VVitness and the Truth,
Christ is the only one.
7
Sing praise to Christ, exalt him then,
And look to him always;
O sing to him, and never cease
Till you do end your days.
HYMN 187.
The heavenly Feast.
1
O Praise the Lord, and look to him,
Sing praise unto his Name;
O all ye Saints of Heaven and Earth
Set forth his glorious fame:
2
Who spared not his only Son,
But gave him for us all;
And made him drink the Cup of Wrath,
The Wormwood and the Gall.
3
He died indeed, but rose again,
And did ascend on high,
That we poor Sinners lost and dead
Might live eternally.
4
His Flesh is heavenly Food indeed,
His Blood is Drink divine,
His Graces drops, like Honey-falls,
His Comforts taste like Wine.
5
Lord Christ, thou have refreshed our Souls
With thy abounding Grace;
For which we magnify thy Name,
Longing to see thy Face.
6
Let the Redeemed of the Lord
Their thankful voices raise;
Can we be dumb whilst Angels sing
Our great Redeemer's praise.
7
Come let us join with Angels then,
Glory to God on high;
Peace upon Earth, Good Will to Men,
Thus sing eternally.
HYMN 188.
The Harvest is the end of the World.
Harvest of Joy.
1
THe Harvest-day will soon be here,
A blessed day 'twill be
To all those Souls who are sincere,
For Jesus they shall see.
2
Thou send'st thy glorious Rays on us,
And Dews, our Souls to cheer;
But e're long we with open Eyes
The Vision shall have clear.
3
Most sweet reviving Acts of Grace
Are those we feel of thine,
Whilst we behold thy glorious Face,
Yet stronger Beams will shine,
4
To comfort and rejoice each heart
To all eternity;
From thee, O Lord, we never shall start,
But in thy Garner lie;
5
Or rather in thy precious Arms
We being ripened,
Shall housed be with lasting Charms
Of Glory on our Head.
6
No sorrow shall us then annoy,
Nor fears cause inward pain;
Nor sin nor Satan spoil our joy,
Nor filth our glory stain.
7
We shall not then, as now, be vexed
With Satan, World, and Sin;
Nor with base Hearts be more perplexed
When Heaven has took us in.
HYMN 189.
The woeful Harvest of the Wicked.
1
THis World will quickly have an end,
That is the Harvest-day;
And Jesus will the Reapers send,
They come and shall not stay.
2
The Angels they the Reapers be,
The Wheat are God's Elect,
Which shall, Lord, gathered be to thee,
The Tares thou will reject:
3
The Tares are those vile wicked Men
Who do thy Saints annoy,
Which shall in Bundles bound be then,
That thou may them destroy;
4
And into Flames thou will them cast,
Their Worm shall never die;
The Fire too shall ever last
Even to Eternity.
5
The false Professor will be found
Amongst the cursed Foe;
And with profane Ones shall be bound,
And equal sorrow know.
6
But a blessed day will be to those
Whose Hearts are found upright,
Who did in truth with Jesus close,
And served him day and night.
7
They shall with thee in glory be,
Lord Christ when thou do come;
But Unbelievers shall from thee
Receive their final doom.
HYMN 190.
Christ's Passion and Exaltation.
1
HOsanna to King David's Son,
The Lord's anointed One,
Who quickly shall exalted be
Upon his glorious Throne.
2
Triumph and shout, O Heavens high
And let the Earth rejoice!
And let the Saints melodiously
Lift up in Songs their voice
3
To Christ the King, because that he
A Feast provideth here;
And tells us we all welcome be
To eat of his good Cheer.
4
His Flesh for us does freely give,
His Blood to drink also,
That we might never die but live,
These Blessings from him flow.
5
His bleeding VVounds, outstretched Arms,
And yearning Bowels dear,
To us run out for sweet support,
That so we might not fear.
6
Thou art the first, yea and the last,
Was dead, and art alive;
And lives for ay, therefore to thee
All honor we must give.
HYMN 191.
The Second Part.
Awake ye Virgins.
1
O Virgins know, both Fools and Wise,
The Bridegroom is at hand;
He comes, he comes, let it suffice,
But who with him shall stand?
2
He that his Lamp does fitly trim,
And Oil does get good store,
Shall then embraced be by him,
And reign for evermore.
3
Cast off your drowze, let us all awake,
It Is not a time to slumber;
But speedily our Lamps lets take,
And haste to the VVedding-Chamber;
4
For certainly our dearest Lord
Will quickly come away;
The midnight Cry will soon be heard,
His Chariots will not stay.
5
O take thy flight on VVings of Love,
And like the nimble Heart,
Come, Lord, O come down from above!
Let Us meet and never part.
6
The Bride says, Come, O do not stay!
And he that hears thy voice,
In hopes that thou will come away,
Most sweetly does rejoice.
HYMN 192.
Christ's Humiliation and Exaltation.
The Third Part.
1
THe Spirit says, Dear Jesus come;
The thirsty Soul does cry
Daily to thee; this is the sum,
O come most speedily.
2
Signs of thy Day upon us be,
The World it is perplexed;
The Nations groan and long for thee,
By Wars being sorely vexed.
3
Thy Saints do mourn, their Sighs and Tears
Invite thee for to come,
The Martyrs Blood cries in thy Ears
For Babels final doom.
4
Thou say, Surely I come quickly,
Amen, Amen, O Lord;
O come! O come! my Soul does cry,
According to thy Word.
5
Lord, thou did come, thou came to die,
And bear most bitter pain,
God's Justice for to satisfy,
And Pardon to obtain.
6
Thou did come to be humbled,
And suffer on the Tree,
Therefore shall thou lift up thy Head,
And high exalted be.
7
Thy Right it is to reign as King,
Thou art the only Heir;
The Kingdom's, thine thy Foes down bring,
Thy vengeance let them bear.
HYMN 193.
Signs of the last Day upon us.
The Fourth Part.
1
THe Fig Tree, Lord, does now put forth,
The Summer does draw near,
The Sea does roar, (as thy Word says,)
And Men begin to fear.
2
The VVinter certainly is gone,
The lovely Birds do sing;
The Spring is now a coming on,
Which lasting joy will bring.
3
The voice of the sweet Turtle too
Is heard in this our Land,
What clearer Signs, Lord, can thou show
By thy own wondrous Hand,
4
Of thy approach and glor'ous reign
The Nations angry be;
Thy wrath is come, their glory stain,
Thy Kingdom let us see.
5
The Evening of a former day
Portends a dismal night,
But holy one; our Souls may say,
Our Evening has some light.
6
Not light nor dark, this is the hour,
It Is neither night nor day;
It Is, it is the time of thy dread power,
O haste and come away.
7
The whole Creation sadly groans,
And utters its last cries;
Poor Sion vents her piteous moans,
Whilst Tears fill each Saints Eyes.
O come* ^less'd One, make no delay,
The Wicked do thee dare;
^ome holy Jesus, come away*
Th^ne Arrows do not spare.
Sha^^ Heaven give the long^d for (...)*
That Earth beneath may quake*
That R^^^^ high Towers down may fall
Now the dead Bones do shake.
HYMN 194.
The Day of J^bilee
The Fifth Part.
1
O Blessed Day, how sweet is it
To think upon that time
When Christ shall upon his Throne ^it,
And Summer's in its prime.
2
When all the Earth together shall
Break forth and sweetly sing;
And all Christ's Foes with vengeance fall,
Who own not him for King.
3
When Saints who now divided are,
Shall all united be;
And in their glittering Robes appear,
And sing in harmony
4
When Swords and also warlike Spears
Men shall to Plow-shears beat;
And all Men quite be freed from fears,
And from all scorching heat:
5
And under their own Vines sit down
With hearts full of sweet joy;
O come, Lord Jesus, take the Crown,
O haste and come away.
6
Wars then we find shall ever cease,
Envy amongst Men depart;
Nothing but Love and blessed Peace
In each Believer's heart.
7
The Lion and the Lamb shall then
Together feed and ly;
And the like concord amongst Men
Shall then be certainly.
HYMN 195.
A Hymn of Praise.
1
O Let us sing with cheerful hearts
Sweet Hymns of Soul-delight!
With one accord before the Lord,
That Is pleasing in his sight.
2
What People have more cause to praise
The living God on high,
Than have all those whom thou have chose,
And for whom Christ did die!
3
With full assurance let us draw near,
That we accepted be;
And then our peace will much increase,
Which, Lord, we have in thee.
4
O what a kind of Love is this
The Father grants to us,
To be the Sons of God above,
And him to call us thus!
5
We know not now what we shall see,
Yet this thou do declare,
That like to thee we all shall be,
When thou do next appear.
6
True Faith let us have on Christ to rest,
And Hope, which cannot fail;
That does take hold, Lord Christ, of thee
Who art within the vail.
7
And then, O Lord, if Storms arise,
And Seas afresh should roar,
We shall in thee secured be
Now and for evermore.
HYMN 196.
The bleeding and wounded Heart.
1
O Lord, how sad's the case of Man,
By reason of the Fall!
His heart is hard, that nothing can,
Alas, pierce it at all,
2
Until the time does come when he
God's power within does know;
O then he does, Lord, seek to thee,
Not knowing what to do.
3
O happy Souls, who pierced have been,
And broken thoroughly,
In the true sight and sense of sin,
And do on Christ rely.
4
Such who are broken, thou will heal,
Who the Physician art,
Thou will not cast off any such
Who have a contrite heart.
5
Let Sinners, Lord, die unto sin,
Wound them, O Lord, we pray!
And let them find Soul-life within,
And comfort every day.
6
O bless thy Word, and let it be
Salvation to the Poor;
And we thy Praises, Lord, will sing
Now and for evermore.
HYMN 197.
Things done for us.
1
SOme things for us, Lord, must be done
By thy Almighty Hand;
It must be Jesus Christ alone
Who in our stead did stand;
2
Who bore thy heavy wrath, O Lord,
For us upon the Tree;
And paid the Debts which Sinners owe
To thy dread Majesty.
3
All praise and glory let us sing
To God the Lord most high,
Who did to us Salvation bring
From Hell and Misery.
4
The Just for the Unjust did bear
The punishment of sin,
That we of righteousness might share,
Who so defiled have been.
5
Shall Life now in our Souls be wrought,
And Grace implanted be,
That home to Christ we may be brought,
And Union have with thee?
6
Then will we sing sweet Songs of Praise,
And lift thy Name on high;
And happy be, Lord, all our days,
More happy when we die.
HYMN 198.
Things done in us.
1
O Lord what have thou done for us?
And in us also wrought;
On the Lord Jesus we depend,
By whom our Souls were bought.
2
All praise and glory unto God
Who has made us alive,
And to exalt thee let us see
We all of us do strive:
3
And to excel in doing all
That thou do us command;
And readily obey thy Call,
That we may one day stand
4
With boldness, and the greatest joy,
Before thy glorious Throne,
When many Persons bitterly
Shall cry with woeful moan.
5
Our works are all wrought in us, Lord,
And for us too by thee;
Thy Praises therefore we will sing,
And that continually.
HYMN 199.
Grace shining.
1
LET such who have enlightened been
Behold thy glorious Grace
And Power divine, prepared to shine
Before all Peoples face.
2
By thy Grace, Lord, O let us move,
And with a holy Song
Exalt thee who do dwell above,
To whom all praise belongs.
3
It Is none but thee who can appease
The wrath that burns within,
And to a wounded heart give ease,
That Is burdened with sin.
4
We thee adore, and worship do,
And at thy precious Feet
Contentedly we all would lie
To taste thy mercy sweet.
5
And thon, dear Savior, who for sin
The Curse did undergo,
Unless thy Arm revealed had been,
No help to us could flow.
6
All praise to God, and to the Lamb
And Spirit be therefore;
Teach us to know what we must do,
And sing for evermore.
HYMN 200.
Bread indeed.
1
HOw good, O Lord, is thy blessed Word
To all that are sincere!
Because it does such good afford,
Thy Children love it dear.
2
O let us taste of thy sweet Love,
And in thy self delight;
And feed us also from above
Every day and night.
3
That with the fat things of thy House
We all may feasted be;
And flourish in thy glorious Courts,
Dear God, continually.
4
Many do seem to be content,
Whilst they on Husks do feed;
But let our Souls to Christ be bent,
And stored with all we need.
5
One hour in thy blessed Courts let us prize
Above all times and days;
And also sing and laud thy Name,
And live unto thy praise.
HYMN 201.
A Feast of Fat things.
1
LOrd, thou art great, and also good;
Thy Love and Grace is such,
Thou giv'st poor hungry Souls sweet Food,
And nothing think too much;
2
For them who unto Christ do come,
All things prepared be;
No sooner do they once come home,
But welcome are to thee.
3
The fatted Calf, and Bread indeed,
And precious Wine good store;
And all things else which Sinners need,
Are ready for the Poor:
4
Where feed and feast all on free cost
May such who hungry be;
All is of Grace, that none may boast,
But only, Lord, in thee.
6
O then let us* eat and drink the best,
And praise the Lord above;
And lean upon his dearest Breast
Till ravished with Love.
HYMN 202.
Unless ye believe that I am he, etc.
1
HOw dark is he, how blind, also
Who has a carnal mind?
He has no peace if he so die,
He none shall ever find.
2
He that in Christ does not believe,
Nor in Truth now receive
The offers of his special Grace,
May not his Loss retrieve.
3
Die in your Sins, Tremble and Fear,
What Man is it can hear
Those words, and find his heart not now
Rent and to pieces tare?
4
Let Us lift thy Name, O Lord, on high,
And make sweet melody;
And so believe and live, that we
In sin may never die.
HYMN 203.
The glorious Gift.
1
ALL praise and glory now be given
To God, the Lord above,
Who gives to us the best of Heaven,
Himself, His Grace, and Love.
2
Most precious are his Promises,
They firm and sure be;
Thou all our wants wilt, Lord, supply,
And that continually.
3
Though we are poor in earthly things,
And little do possess;
Yet richer are than wicked Kings,
And never shall have less.
4
He that has God, possesses all,
And what would he have more?
Shall not that Man contented be?
Can any think he is poor?
5
O let us then lift up our voice,
And sing melodiously;
And in the Lord always rejoice
Until we come to die.
HYMN 204.
Christ became poor.
1
O Holy and most glorious King,
The mighty Prince of Peace,
Thou art that Lamb by whom we came
From sin to have release.
2
Thou in the glorious Form of God,
Before all Worlds indeed,
Most splendently O thou did shine,
And nothing did thou need:
3
And yet thy love to us was such,
Thou for us becam'st poor,
That we through thy great Poverty
Might all have Riches store.
4
We never can to thee express
Our Thanks sufficiently,
Who in our stead, and for our sakes
A shameful death did die.
5
The Wrath and Curse that was our due,
O Lord, thou did endure;
And in the Grave, O thou did lie,
Our freedom to procure.
6
O depths and heighths of divine Love!
None can compare with thee,
So low to lie, that we on high
At last might raised be.
7
Lord, thou art all in all to us,
To God all praise therefore;
To him, to thee, and Spirit, we
Will sing for evermore.
HYMN 205.
A Hymn of Dr. P. taken out of his [ Century of select Psalms, p. 201.]
Revelations.)
ALL ye that serve the Lord, his Name
See that ye celebrate;
And ye that fear him, sing aloud
His praise, both small and great.
O thou great Ruler of the World,
Thy Works our wonder raise:
Thou blessed King of Saints, how true
And righteous are thy ways!
Who would not fear and praise thy Name,
Thou only Holy One?
The World shall worship thee, to whom
Thy Judgments are made known.
Most Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord
Almighty is thy Name;
Which was before all time, and is*
And shall be still the same.
All Glory, Power, and Honor, tho^.
Art worthy to receive;
For all things by thy Power were made,
And by thy Pleasure live.
To thee of right, O Lamb of God,
Riches and Power belong;
Wisdom and Honor, Glory, Strength,
And every praising Song.
Thou as our Sacrifice wast slain,
And by thy precious Blood,
From every Tongue and Nation have
Redeemed us unto God.
Blessing and Honor, Glory, Power,
By all in Earth and Heaven,
To him that sits upon the Throne,
And to the Lamb, be given.
PART IX. Containing part of some Select PSALMS of DAVID.
HYMN 206.
Psalm. 1. The Blessed Man.
1
THe Man is blessed that shuns the Snare
Of wicked Men's advice,
Whom Sinners Paths, or Scorners Chair
By no means can entice:
2
But his delight both day and night
Is in God's holy Law,
Wherein he waits and meditates
With constant care and awe.
3
Like planted Tree by Water-Springs
Shall such a Man be made,
A Tree that timely Fruit brings forth,
Whose Leaf shall never fade:
4
And God shall bless with good success
All actions of the Just;
Unlike them far the wicked are,
And as the driven Dust:
5
Therefore the Ungodly never may
In Judgment stand acquitted;
Nor with the Just in that great Day
Shall Sinners be admitted;
6
For Men upright are Gods delight,
Their way to him is known;
But Sinners way shall soon decay,
And quite be overthrown.
HYMN 207.
Psalm. 2. Christ's Kingdom.
1
WHy do the Heathen Gentiles rage,
And foolish things surmize?
Kings set themselves against the Lord,
And do his Christ despise.
2
His gracious Government they count
Their Yoke, his Laws their Chain;
Freedom they will have without control,
No Bands shall them restrain;
3
But God above will scorn their rage,
Their vain attempts deride;
He will affright them in his wrath,
Vex and defeat their pride.
4
For all their spite I Have set my King
Upon his holy Throne;
And what I had decreed before,
Proclaimed him now my Son.
5
This is the Birthday of his Rule,
Thy Scepter I Will advance
Over all the Earth, the Gentiles give
For thine Inheritance.
6
Thou with an Iron Rod shall bruise
Their disobedient Neck;
Like brittle Potsherds all their Powers
Without resistance break.
7
Let the great Rulers of the Earth
This greater Lord obey;
Serve him with cheerful willingness,
And fear him too each day.
8
In low submission to the Son
Your happiness does lie;
then ye are safe when he is well-pleased;
When he is provoked, ye die.
HYMN 208.
Psalm. 4. The Saints Security in God.
1
FOnd Men, that would my glory stain,
My Government despise;
How long will ye pursue vain hopes,
And please your selves with lies?
2
Know that the Lord does righteous Men
With special favor own;
Though ye despise me, he never will
On my Petitions frown.
3
Sin not, but fear; let quiet Thoughts
Instruct and make you wise;
Join a pure Heart with Trust in God,
As the best Sacrifice.
4
Though others in distrust of thee
To other succors fly,
Thou art our Hope, Lord, cast on us
A favorable Eye.
5
Thy Love more chears my heart than when
Their Corn has wished increase;
Or when a happy Vantage makes
Their Wine overflow the Press.
6
Down will I lie in peace, and sleep
Shall close my wearied Eyes;
No fear disturb me whilst I know
In God my Safety lies.
HYMN 209.
Psalm. 7. Wrath against Persecutors.
1
GOD is a righteous Judge be sure,
And one that will repay;
And with the lewd and wicked Doer
God's angry every day:
2
Unless he do his sins forego,
And speedily repent,
He Will whet his Sword, and string his Bow,
He has it ready bent.
3
His deadly Darts he does ordain
To smite him unawares;
And for the Persecutors pain
Sharp Arrows he prepares.
4
He made a Pit, in digging which
No pains at all he spared;
And fell he is into the Ditch
Which he himself prepared.
5
Upon his own unhappy Crown
His mischief shall be spread;
His violent dealings shall come down,
And light on his own head.
6
But I his Justice will proclaim,
Who judges righteously;
And with a Song will praise the Name
Of God until I die.
HYMN 210.
Psalm. 11. The Misery of the Wicked.
1
GOD in his Sanctuary dwells,
Heavens glorious Throne,
From whence he views the Sons of Men,
And judges every one.
2
When he examins righteous Ones,
He does their works approve;
Such as are wicked and unjust,
His Soul can never love.
3
Snares shall besall them, and for these
This mixture is made up,
Fire, Brimstone, and tempestuous Storms
The Portion of their Cup.
4
God who himself is righteous, does
In righteousness delight,
And still will favor and protect
The Man that is upright.
HYMN 211.
Psalm. 15 The spotless Saint.
1
LOrd, let me know that happy Man
Whom thou so well do love,
That he may praise thee here below,
And dwell with thee above.
2
It Is he whose Life is free from blame,
Whose works are right and just;
Whose hearts and words are true, and whom
One may securely trust.
3
His Neighbors Credit does not wound
By a detracting Tongue;
Nor in his Infamy delight,
Much less would do him wrong.
4
Who does not break his Oath when he
To his own damage swears;
But his strict Virtue far before
His Interest preferrs.
5
Who hates Exaction, and rejects
Bribes to betray the Just;
This Man shall never be moved, but may
In God securely trust.
HYMN 212.
Psalm. 23. Pastures green and flourishing.
1
MY Shepherd is the living Lord,
It Is he that does me feed;
How can I but be richly stored,
Whilst he supplies my need.
2
In Pastures green and flourishing
He makes me to repose,
Hard by the silent Water-Spring,
Whose Streams with pleasure flows.
3
He guides my Soul, so apt to stray,
A safer course to take;
Conducting me in his right way,
For his alone Name's sake:
4
And though I walk in Death's dark shade,
It shall me not dismay;
For thou art with me, and have made
Thy Rod and Staff my stay.
5
My Table spread thou did appoint
In presence of my Foe;
My Head with O^l thou do anoint,
My Cup does overflow.
6
Thy Grace and Goodness certainly
Shall measure all my days;
And in thy House, O God, will I
For ever give thee praise.
HYMN 213.
Psalm. 102. Sion repaired.
1
Thou will arise in Mercy yet,
And Grace to Sion send,
Because the time for favor set
Is now come to an end;
2
For even in the Stones thereof
Thy Servants take delight,
Her very Dust is cause enough
Of favor in thy sight.
3
And then the Heathen far and near
Shall dread thy glorious Name;
And all the Kings on Earth shall fear
Thy Glory and thy Fame.
4
When as the Lord shall once repair
Poor Sions broken Wall,
His Glory then shall shine so fair,
It shall appear to all.
5
He will regard the destitute,
And not despise their Prayer;
He will regard their humble Suit
With tender love and care.
6
O let the God of Israel then
Be praised with one accord;
Hence^orth for evermore, Amen,
All Men praise ye the Lord.
HYMN 214.
Psalm. 36. 37. The perfect Man.
1
MArk and behold the perfect Man,
For that Man's end is peace;
But quickly shall Transgressors all
Be quite cut off and cease.
2
But the Salvation of the Just
Is of the Lord most high;
Their strength and stay in the evil day
Of their adversity.
3
And he shall shield and save the Just,
And keep them Life and Limb;
Deliv'ring them from wicked Men,
Because they trust in him.
Psalm 4.
4
The greater sort crave worldly Wealth,
And Riches they embrace;
But, Lord, grant us thy Saving-health,
And shining of thy Face.
5
O praise the Lord, Jerusalem,
Thy God. O Sion, praise;
For lo thy Gates and Bars of them
He very strongly stays.
6
Thy Children in thee he has blessed,
Thy peace he makes full great;
And fills thee with the very best
And finest of the Wheat.
7
Let Isreal's God the Lord therefore
Be praised altogether;
From first to last, for evermore,
Amen, Amen for ever.
HYMN 215.
Psalm. 135. Prayer readily answered.
1
THe Lord is just in all his ways,
Holy in all he does;
And nigh to every one that prays,
And calls on him in truth.
2
He will fulfill the just desires
Of all the holy Seed;
He hears their cry, what that requires,
And helps them at their need.
3
The Lord preserves faithfully
All those that do him love,
But all the wicked he will destroy
With vengeance from above:
4
Therefore my mouth shall speak his praise,
And universal flesh
His holy Name renown shall raise,
And ever sound afresh.
HYMN 216.
Psalm. 95. Spiritual Worshippers.
1
COme, let us with united joys
To God our voices raise;
With thankful hearts before him come
And loudly sing his praise.
2
Our Lord is a great God and King,
In Power eminent
Above all Gods, him Angels serve,
And Princes represent.
3
To him that made us let us kneel,
And Adoration give,
Who are his People, and the Sheep
That on his Pasture live.
4
To day let us hear his voice, and not
Such hardened Sinners prove,
As those that in the Wilderness
Provoked God above.
5
They proved his Power, and saw his Works,
And grieved him forty year,
Till wearied with the murmuring Race,
He could no longer bear.
6
He did their Unbelief, and base
Ingratitude detest;
And in his anger swore they should
Not come into his rest.
HYMN 217.
Psalm. 84. Sacred Pantings.
1
HOw amiable are thy blessed Tents,
Lord God of Hosts, to me;
My Soul does long, yea even faint,
Thy sacred Courts to see.
2
My heart and flesh cry out for thee
The Everlasting God,
O when shall I come near and see
The place of thine abode?
3
O happy they who hold a Place
Within thy House to dwell;
For in thy Courts one days short space
A thousand does excel.
4
Much rather would I keep a Door,
And in thy House remain,
Than dwell in all the pomp and store
Of Tents of the profane;
5
For God a Sun and Shield will be,
With Grace and Glory bright;
And no good thing withold will he
From them that walk upright.
6
Lord God of Hosts, whose Glory reigns,
How happy Man is he,
That though debarred the outward means,
Yet puts his trust in thee.
HYMN 218.
Psalm. 100. Sheep of God's Pasture.
1
MAke joyful noise unto the Lord,
O all ye Nations on the Earth,
Serve him with joy, his praise record,
Come in his sight with Songs of Mirth.
2
Know that the Lord is God alone,
We are the Flock which he does keep;
His workmanship, and not our own,
His People and his Pasture-Sheep.
3
Enter his Gates with thankfulness,
And come with joy into his Courts;
Great gratitude to him express,
And bless his Name in full resorts;
4
For lo, the Lord is good and kind,
His Mercy everlasting is;
His Truth all Generations find
For evermore assured to his.
HYMN 219.
Psalm. 135. A Psalm of Praise.
1
GIve laud unto the Lord,
And praise his holy Name;
His Praises still record,
And spread abroad his Fame,
Ye that resort
To our great God, and have abode
In Sions Court.
2
His Honor, O proclaim,
For good and kind he is;
Sing Praises to his Name,
A pleasant work it is:
Jacob has he
Chose to himself, and all his Wealth
Must Israel be.
3
And this I clearly know
The Lord's a mighty One,
And that all Gods do owe
Subjection to his Throne;
For he brings forth
Whatever he please, in Deeps, in Seas,
In Heaven and Earth.
HYMN 220.
Psalm. 90. Longings for good Times.
1
REturn, O Lord, how long a space!
Let it repent thee much;
Touching thy Servants woeful case,
Whose sufferings have been such.
2
O satisfy us speedily
With thy Compassions kind,
That all our days may yield us joy,
And gladness cheer our mind.
3
As thou have sent us Sorrows keen,
So let us have Comforts glad,
For days and years which we have seen
So sorrowful and sad.
4
O let thy Work appear unto
Thy Servants every one;
Thy glory to our Children show,
When we are dead and gone.
4
The (...) God shine on his Church,
And Grace our joint endeavor;
O prosper thou our handiwork,
And 'stablish it for ever.
HYMN 221.
Psalm. 103. Free Pardon.
1
MY Soul now bless with readiness
The Lord's most holy Name,
And let my heart's most inward parts
Applaud and spread his fame.
2
O bless the Lord, his praise record,
My Soul be not unkind,
As one that slights his Benefits,
And puts them out of mind:
3
Who pardons thy Iniquity,
And cancels all thy score;
Who heals thy Infirmity,
And does thy health restore:
4
Who from the Grave thy Life did save,
And Crowns thee from above;
With Mercies free enlarged to thee
By his most tender love:
5
Who satisfies thy Mouth likewise
With Blessings that are good;
Thy flower of Youth, as the Eagles, does
He make afresh to bud.
HYMN 222.
Psalm. 148. All Creatures to praise God.
1
O Praise Jehovah every one,
From Heaven praise him in places high!
O all his Angels praise him ye,
Praise him his Host most gloriously!
2
Ye Sun and Moon do ye him praise,
All Stars of Light praise him do ye!
O Heaven of Heavens do ye the like,
And Waters that 'bove Heavens be!
3
O let them praise Jehovah's Name!
By him created were all they;
For ever he established them,
Gave Statutes which pass not away.
4
O praise Jehovah from the Land,
Ye Dragons, and all places deep;
Ye Fire and Hail, Snow, Vapor, and
Windy Storms that his Word keep.
5
Ye Mountains and ye Hills also,
Ye Trees fruitful and Cedars high;
And ye wild Beasts and Cattle all,
Ye creeping things, and Fowls that fly.
6
Ye Kings who rule the People do,
Princes and Judges likewise; all
Young Men and Maidens do the same,
With Old Men and ye Children small.
7
O let them praise Jehovah's Name!
Who has a Name like unto his,
It Is high advanced; his glorious Fame
Above the Earth and Heaven is.
8
And he the Horn of his People
Exalted has, and set on high;
O praise the Lord, sweet Israel,
A People unto him so nigh.
