A SERMON Preached at Glascow in SCOTLAND, By Mr. JAMES KEA, TO The Rebels in
Arms.
The TEXT, Sion is wounded.
BEluved in our Loard,
before I gang any further, gee me leave, by the geate, to show ye two things,
and then I's open my Text and hanle my pearts as they ligg in order. 1st.
Beluved, wha is meant by Sion i'my Text, that is ean the pure Kirk a Scotland,
the hally Profet talls ye with a hoy heart, that Sion is wonded; but gen he had
leved e these weafow days a ours, he e plain terms wad a tall'd ye that te
pure Kirk a Scotland is wonded. 2ly. Wha has wonded her tro ye? To this purpose
I's tell ye a tale, but I's nay say it is true; but be it true, or be it fauce,
takt as I tink it a Gods beneson: When I was a young Laddy, thur was a warsom
man a Student a Theology in the College of Aberdeen, an he was te make a
Preechment before te Masters a this College; an out au te hally Scripture o
God he weiled this Text: an he tall'd 'um, What will ye give me, an Is It betray
her to ye? (and he cud hasel it in Latin, Quid dabitis?) And tere was a honest
auld man sitinge at te fuet of te Powpit, and he ses tull him, Sir, gin yele
betray him te me, Is It give ye a geud fat Bishopric. Now ye may here by this
wha it is that betrays Crist, an wonds te pure Kirk a Scotland. But now te come
te my Text, Sion is wonded, te pure Kirk of Scotland is wonded; where is she
wonded tro ye? I trow an she were well lanced, there wad ne prove a sond bit in
hur; but for mere satisfaction, she is wonded e fore places. 1st. She is wonded
e hur head, e respect a hur Rulars. 2ly. E hur hands, e respect a hur
Decipline. 3ly. E hur heart, e respect a hur Doctrine. An 4ly. E hur feet, e
respect of hur Worship. Now we Gads good leave ya ward or two to eke a them, in
a ward a applycation, and se Is It come te a close. 1st. Beluved, te pure Kirk a
Scotland is wonded e hur head, e respect a hur Rulars. Is It teel ye, Beluved, te
pure Kirk a Scotland has got sick a clack o hur head as has gerd hur breins to
jumpe agean: and who is it, tro you? I mean by hur Rulars, ene those that
misrule hur; that is ene te proud Bishops. And te Bishops they ha wonded hur we
three Sweards: 1st. We te sweard o there Pride. I ha seen te day, and sea has
sum o yea, when a gued Minister wad a gen tripen up an down te geate fow
wansamly, we a Cap o his head an a short Cleake we a side-neck, an a Gads name
he wad a made a fow wansom Preechment wad a den a heart gued to a heard him: But
te Bishops thur proud fow swingers, tha mun ha thur silk Girdles hang dribbling
about thur Arses, an as mickle about thur tales as wad make six peer a Briches
tell a peer man. 2ly. she has wonded te pure Kirk a Scotland we the sweard a hur
Gluttony. I ha heard te day that a gued Minister wad ha been weel content we a
dish fow a Milk an Bread, or ought that te hally gued Gad wad a sent; but te
Bish. thur bellygad lownes, Is It fear tha'l no gang te the Deele we lean
branes: they eat and drink an feed o te fat o te Land, but gen a peer man cum
to thur dear death-like, even to famish for caud an hanger, tha'l naw ge him se
micle as wad fill his maw. 3ly. Tha ha wonded te peer Kirk a Scotland we the
sweard of thur Covetusness. Beluved, tha mun ha sea mickle ilken Bural, sea
mickle Bridal, and sea mickle for ilken Wile an Testament, an Gad kens what
mere beside; weel Is It say in a wurd ge um ene te Deel for he is mickle, an tha
ar ene greedy that near be satisfied. Tha ha sea robbed, an sea hirried, and
sea pillaged an plundered te peer Kirk a Scotland, that began Gad will ne scarge
um out o'th Land, as he did ye ance before, tha'l ne leave hur so mickle as yaw
nale to claw hur sell withaw. 2ly. Te peer Kirk a Scotland is wounded e hur
hans, e respect o hur Discipline. Is It teel ye, Beluved, te peer Kirk a
Scotland is so wounded e hur hands, that this long while sine te King o Angland
came in, she cud nere make a hammock o a cauld day: we ha sike straung an
uncouth Laws among us, weel anger us aul te heart before we geet rid o um: tha
teel us we mun ne preech we out ore white sackes o or backs, an that we mun ha
a neest a whisles set up e or Kirks; that we mun ha ore Barnes baptezed we a
sine o te Cross, or rader we te sine o te hoar; well let te homigers de what te
will, Is It fear Christ an his hally Desciples near learnt any sike thing. 3ly.
Te peer Kirk a Scotland is wonded e hur Heart e respect o hur Doctrine. Te Kirk a
Scotland is se rotten o hur Heart, an that same infection has se spread it sell
through aw hur body, that te sea the truth o hur, she is another sond wind nor
lim, an ne portion will cure hur but te hally, hally Solemn League and
Cuvenant renewed, which we Gads good blessing wad restore hur to hur wonted
health. Again, 4ly. Te peer Kirk a Scotland is wonded e hur feet e respect o hur
Worship. I can remember, Beluved, sine te Kirk o Scotland meght a-been liknet
te a bony nagg, that cud amelet an peace it fow sweetly; but te Bishops thur
galloping swingers tha gat o ye back o that nag, an tha quite jaded hime up te
ruin; for they lade upon hur back te buek o Common Prayer, an te buek o Cannons;
an sine tha came to London, they lade upon hur back te Yeath o Supremacy an te
Kirk Law-bueks; an than they came trippen down te Edinburgh te unlate thur
baggage, I wornt what arrant tha had there; but Beluved, what here an what
there, tha ha sea used him, that they ha no left yeaw fast nail e his fuet: an
now Beluved, we may tell ore teale without lauter, we can liken hime now to
neane but Balams Ass, e which story thur be three things te be heeded. 1. Te
Ass, that is ene te peer Kirk o Scotland. 2ly. Te riders, an that is ene te proud
Bishops. 3ly. Te gued Angel that stopped te Ass by te geate, an who tro ye is
that? I wot weel ye wad fain hear that; why it is ene my good Lard H. Gads
benison on his bony face, there he sits, the trimest light that ere te peer Kirk
o Scotland ever saw. And now we hope te gued Angel will kick te lownes out o
the saddle, for he hangs by te hough, hauf out an haufe in; an fain wad he keep
in still; an talls ye, let him but stay in an he will nere trouble ye we te
porkmantle any mere; but the Deele is a wilye paw, let him but get in his
little finger, an he will seen get in his heel hand; let but te Lownes get his
arse into the saddle ageane, an ye may aw paw tell ye are weary before ye can
get him out again. But now ya ward or two o uses: an 1. ya word o incorragment
te all te gued people o Gad, that ha set thur heart an hans te renewing te auld
an ancient Solemn League an Cuvenant: weel, Is It say ne mere but this, as ye ha
began this gued warke, ene see it perfect, and ye shall no loose year reward e
heaven, 2ly. I ha ya word o reproof to ye Provest and Bayliffe of this gued
Town, ye weel ne subscribe te year, but bide te next year an then ye weel; but
I see ye are aw alive te year, but Gad kens who will be alife neext. I ha ya
ward mere o reproof to ye Collecters o ye Kings rents, ye will no subscribe
nowther, till next year yer Offices be out, for fear o the Kings displeasure.
Beluved, I mun conclude we ya ward, an that is this, ene this; There is but ya
sort o folk between Gad an ye: tak away that sort o men, an ye may aw gang to
heven, sheeke by shole, yan by another.

FINIS.
